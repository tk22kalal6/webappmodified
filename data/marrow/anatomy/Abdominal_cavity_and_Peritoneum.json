An imaginary line passing through them forms the trans-tubercular plane which lies at the upper border of L5. The abdomen is divided into 9 regions based on the following: • Two transverse planes: 883 Sold by @itachibot • Subcostal plane which is indicated by a line that joins the lowest point of the costal margin on each side. It corresponds to the level of 10th costal cartilage and lower border of second lumbar vertebra(L2) or upper border of third lumbar vertebra (L3) • Trans-tubercular plane is indicated by a line that joins the tubercles of the iliac crests.
