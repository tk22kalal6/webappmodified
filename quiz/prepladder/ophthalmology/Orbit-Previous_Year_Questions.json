      "explanation": "(bulging of the eye) that can worsen with increased venous pressure, such as when the patient bends down or performs actions that increase intra-abdominal or intra-thoracic pressure. Causes of intermittent proptosis: Orbital varix Periodic orbital oedema Recurrent orbital hemorrhage Highly vascular tumors Orbital Varices Dilated venous channels in the orbit (part of the spectrum of developmental venous anomalies) Clinical features Most cases are unilateral and the most frequent site is upper nasal. Slowly progressive intermittent proptosis which worsens with head position changes, bending forward, or Valsalva maneuver. Pathology May involve one large vessel or multiple ectatic veins with fibrotic walls. Thrombosed lumens can contain phleboliths from calcified thrombi. Imaging CT - serpiginous, dense structures that enlarge with Valsalva, enhances with contrast administration. MRI - T1 images show low isointense signal, T2 shows dark signal void from flowing blood. Enhancement with Gadolinium is marked, except in areas of thrombosis. Treatment No treatment needed for mild symptoms; Surgical or embolization options for severe cases. Prognosis Good unless large lesions compress the optic nerve, risking vision loss. Thyroid Eye Disease (Option B): This condition typically causes bilateral proptosis due to inflammation and fibrosis of the extraocular muscles. While proptosis occurs, it does not usually worsen with bending down and is often associated with thyroid dysfunction. It has a more gradual onset compared to conditions like orbital varices. Cavernous Sinus Thrombosis (Option C): This serious condition presents with painful proptosis, usually accompanied by headache, cranial nerve palsies, and vision changes. Proptosis does not typically worsen with bending down, and the condition is associated with acute symptoms and systemic signs of infection. Orbital Cellulitis (Option D): This is an infection of the orbit, causing painful proptosis, redness, and swelling, often accompanied by fever.

        "C": "Ptosis",
        "D": "Diplopia"
      },
      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: A) Proptosis Explanation: The instrument used to measure proptosis is called an exophthalmometer , such as the Hertel or Luedde exophthalmometer. This tool helps assess the degree of ocular protrusion and is particularly useful in diagnosing conditions like proptosis caused by orbital tumors or other space-occupying lesions. Proptosis Proptosis refers to the abnormal protrusion of the eyeball, while exophthalmos specifically describes protrusion of the eyeball. Causes: Retrobulbar lesions (most common cause). Shallow orbit (less common). The optic nerve allows significant forward displacement of the globe (25mm length), causing proptosis without excessive nerve stretching. Types of Proptosis: Axial proptosis: Caused by space-occupying lesions within the muscle cone (e.g., cavernous hemangioma, optic nerve tumors). Combined proptosis and dystopia: Due to extraconal lesions (e.g., lacrimal gland tumor) causing displacement in the coronal plane (dystopia). Dystopia: Displacement of the globe in the coronal plane, either horizontal or vertical. Measured using the midline (nose) for horizontal or a vertical scale for vertical displacement. Measuring Severity: Use a plastic rule, Luedde™ exophthalmometer, or a binocular exophthalmometer (Hertel) for accurate measurements of ocular protrusion. Readings >20 mm or a difference of 2–3 mm between eyes suggests proptosis. Palpebral aperture dimensions and any lagophthalmos should be noted. Pseudoproptosis: A false impression of proptosis due to: Facial asymmetry. Enlarged globe (e.g., high myopia, buphthalmos). Lid retraction or contralateral enophthalmos. Clinical evaluation of proptosis Differentiate proptosis from pseudoproptosis Pseudoproptosis (the false impression of proptosis) may be due to facial asymmetry, enlargement of the globe (high myopia, buphthalmos), lid retraction or contralateral enophthalmos. Asymmetrical proptosis is readily detected by looking down at the patient from above and behind Globe location: If it is misplaced superiorly, inferiorly, medially, laterally, or straight out (axially) by an exophthalmometer. An exophthalmometer is used to quantify the distance from the orbital rim to the corneal surface of each eye in order to assess the symmetry of globe protrusion. Readings >20 mm are indicative of proptosis and a dierence of 2–3 mm or more between the two eyes is suspicious regardless of the absolute values. (Option B) Hertel's exophthalmometer: In adults. Luedde exophthalmometer: In children. Naugle exophthalmometer: Non-axial proptosis Squint (Option B) , also known as strabismus, refers to a misalignment of the eyes, where the eyes do not point in the same direction. The condition is measured using ocular alignment tests (like the Hirschberg test or the Cover test), not an exophthalmometer. Ptosis (Option C) refers to the drooping of the upper eyelid. The severity of ptosis is usually assessed by observing the degree of",
