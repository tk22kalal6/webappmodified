      "correct_answer": "D",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: D) Neisseria gonorrhoeae Explanation: The clinical scenario points to the diagnosis of ophthalmia neonatorum caused by Neisseria gonorrhea and it presents as an inflamed, red, and swollen conjunctiva with discharge that changes fast. Definition Ophthalmia neonatorum or neonatal conjunctivitis is a mucoid, mucopurulent, or purulent discharge from one or both eyes in the first month of life. Any discharge, even watery, from a baby’s eyes in the first week of life must be viewed under suspicion as tears are not secreted so early in life. Aetiology of ophthalmia neonatorum Mode of infection: Before birth: Very rare through infected liquor amnii During birth: From an infected birth canal After birth: During the first bath of a newborn Soiled clothes Fingers with infected lochia Source of infection: Neisseria gonorrhoeae: Transmitted at the time of delivery Presents between 2-5 days of birth The discharge becomes mucopurulent and purulent quickly Inflamed, bright red, swollen conjunctiva Thick yellow pus and marked chemosis Cornea seen at the bottom of a crater-like pit in severe cases Bulbar conjunctiva & lids: dense infiltration, swollen and tense Free flow of pus, serum, and often blood later Chlamydia trachomatis: (Option A) Transmitted at the time of delivery Onset at 5-14 days after birth Serotypes D to K are the most common cause of ophthalmia neonatorum in developed countries Characteristic intracellular inclusion bodies are seen Less severe inflammation Purulent discharge Other causes: Staphylococci Streptococcus pneumoniae Gram-negative coliforms Herpes simplex virus Chemical: silver nitrate solution previously used for prophylaxis immediately after birth (Option B): erythema, chemosis, lid edema, and discharge within the first 24 hours after birth. Prophylaxis Antenatal measures: Treatment of genital infections and care of mother Surveillance of pregnant women for STDs Natal measures: Aseptic, sterile precautions to be followed during deliveries Clean the infant’s closed lids with sterile cotton soaked in normal saline and dried Post-natal measures: Povidone-iodine 2.5% solution If the mother is under suspicion, 1% tetracycline or 0.5%",

        "D": "Normal tear film osmolality"
      },
      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: C) Extensive Rose Bengal staining Explanation: Extensive Rose Bengal staining indicates significant damage to the corneal and conjunctival epithelium, which is a feature of dry eye. Slit-lamp examination Superficial corneal erosions Inadequate tear lake volume Early tear film break-up time Conjunctival hyperemia Conjunctival surface irregularities Meibomian gland dysfunction Schirmer’s Test: Schirmer’s test is used to diagnose aqueous deficiency dry eye disease. Schirmer's Test 1 Measures both basal and reflex tear secretions Uses Whatman-41 filter paper, kept in the lower fornix at the junction of lateral one-third and medial two-thirds. After 5 minutes, wetting of the filter strip from the bent end is measured. Normal value: >15 mm 5-10 mm: Mild to moderate keratoconjunctivitis sicca (KCS). < 5 mm: Severe KCS (Option B) Schirmer's Test 2 Measures only basal secretion under anesthesia Phenol Red Test A modified Schirmer’s test using a cotton thread impregnated with phenol red dye. The thread is placed in the lower fornix for 15 seconds. Phenol dye changes from yellow to red depending on the pH of the tears. Wet length: >20 mm: Normal. <10 mm: Severe dry eye. ≤ 19 mm as borderline dry eye. Tear Film Break-Up Time (TBUT) Tear film stained with sodium fluorescein 1% is observed under a slit lamp, and time is noted after the patient blinks. The interval between the complete blink and the first appearance of a ‘dark’ dry spot on the cornea is recorded as TBUT. It is an indicator of the adequacy of the mucin component of tears. Normal: 15-35 seconds < 10 seconds indicates unstable tear film. (Option A) Rose Bengal or Lissamine Green Stain devitalized, desiccated corneal and conjunctival epithelium red or green. (Option C) Rose Bengal stain Lissamine Green Alcian Blue Stains particulate matter in the tear film due to mucus Tear film Osmolality Increased in dry eye (Option D) Tear to Lysozyme ratio Between 0.9 and 0.6 indicates dry eye.",

      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: C)Cone dystrophy Explanation: Cone dystrophy is primarily associated with day blindness (hemeralopia) , which is the inability to see clearly in bright light due to poor light adaptation. Nyctalopia/ Night Blindness is the inability to see in low-light conditions. It is attributed to interference with the functions of the retinal rods. Causes of Nyctalopia: Retinitis pigmentosa Xerophthalmia Pathological myopia (Option B) Advanced stage of primary open-angle glaucoma Peripheral cortical cataract Diffuse choroidal dystrophy Choroideremia (Option D) Gyrate atrophy (Option A): Due to a deficiency of the enzyme ornithine aminotransferase, plasma ornithine levels are elevated. Characterized by progressive patches of atrophy of choroid and retinal pigment epithelium (RPE). Management: Restriction of arginine (precursor amino acid for ornithine) in diet. Vitamin B6 supplementation lowers plasma ornithine levels. Congenital Stationary Night Blindness (CSNB): Inherited retinal disease that causes night blindness in childhood. 4 types of CSNB Fundus Albipunctatus: Small white dots scattered across the posterior pole, sparing the fovea.

      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: C) 200,000 IU of vitamin A orally on diagnosis, next day, and after 2 weeks. advises administering 200,000 IU of vitamin A immediately, then repeating the dose on the following day and again 2 weeks later. This regimen rapidly replenishes vitamin A stores, which is crucial for reversing ocular damage and preventing severe complications such as corneal ulceration and blindness. Pathological Changes in Epithelium and Tear Film: 1. Alterations in Conjunctival Epithelium: Loss of Mucin Secretion: Leads to tear film instability. Epidermoid Metaplasia: Epithelium transforms into stratified squamous epithelium with granular, keratinized and horny layers. 2. Impact on Tear Film and Ocular Surface: Increased Tear Film Breakup: Exposes ocular surface to dryness. Appearance: Conjunctiva becomes dry and loses its lustre. Management: Vitamin A Supplementation: The cornerstone of treatment is high-dose vitamin A supplementation. Dosages vary by age and severity of the condition: Population Vitamin A Dose Treatment regimen Children ( ≥ 1 year) 200,000 IU orally on diagnosis Day1, Day 2, and 2 weeks later (Option C) Children (Infants under 12 months) 100,000 IU orally Day1, Day 2, and 2 weeks later (Options A and B) Adults (non-pregnant) 200,000 IU orally 200,000 IU orally on Day 1, Day 2, and after 2 weeks. Pregnant Women 10,000 IU orally daily Daily oral administration of 10,000 IU for 1 month (due to the risk of teratogenicity, higher doses are avoided during pregnancy). Lactating Women 200,000 IU orally One dose of 200,000 IU orally Symptomatic Relief: Artificial Tears: Lubricate the ocular surface, Frequency adjustment (1 to 6 hourly) Mucomimetic Agents: Mimic natural mucin to stabilize the tear film; Used alongside artificial tear Reference: KANSKI’S Clinical Ophthalmology, 9th edition, Page- 248.",

      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: B) Type IV hypersensitivity reaction to endogenous bacterial antigens Explanation: The above presentation is a case of phlyctenular keratoconjunctivitis primarily mediated by a delayed-type (Type IV) hypersensitivity reaction triggered by bacterial proteins of Staphylococcus aureus or tuberculosis.The child's history of TB is significant, as TB antigens can trigger this hypersensitivity response, leading to the characteristic ocular findings. The immune system reacts to these antigens, causing the formation of nodules (phlyctens) and subsequent inflammation around the limbus. This explains the localized inflammatory response seen in this condition. Phlyctenular keratoconjunctivitis Cause Allergic reactions to endogenous antigens are often linked to bacterial infections such as Staphylococcus aureus (M/C/C in Western countries) or tuberculosis (M/C/C in India). Symptoms & signs Watering, itching Reflex blepharospasm (involuntary blinking) Conjunctival congestion Phlycten - Small, round, grayish, or yellowish nodules on the bulbar conjunctiva near the limbus . Corneal involvement can lead to fascicular ulcers or ring ulcers. Pathophysiology Type IV hypersensitivity reaction. Common Complications Corneal involvement: Ulcers form on the cornea, leading to potential scarring. Associated Conditions Long-standing mild infections like tonsillitis or adenoiditis , and in populations with a high prevalence of tuberculosis . Treatment Local therapy: Corticosteroids: Drops/ointment to reduce inflammation. Address underlying cause (e.g., tuberculosis). Antibiotics Cycloplegics: Paralyze ciliary muscle, relieve pain, and prevent complications. Dark Glasses/Eye Shade: For photophobia relief. General therapy: Oral tetracycline or doxycycline is used in recurrent cases linked to Staphylococcal blepharitis. Supportive: Dark glasses or eye shade. Type I hypersensitivity reaction caused by environmental allergens(Option A): Type I hypersensitivity from environmental allergens, like pollen, causes rapid IgE-mediated allergic reactions. Type II hypersensitivity reaction triggered by viral infections(Option C): Type II hypersensitivity, seen in viral infections, involves antibody-mediated cell destruction, not related to phlyctenular keratoconjunctivitis. Autoimmune reaction against corneal epithelial cells(Option D): Phlyctenular keratoconjunctivitis is an immune response to bacterial proteins, not an autoimmune attack on corneal epithelial cells",

The most common cause is Moraxella axenfeld. Angular Conjunctivitis Type of chronic conjunctivitis characterized by mild inflammation confined to the conjunctiva and lid margins near the angles of the eyes, associated with maceration of the surrounding skin. Causative Agent Moraxella axenfeld is the most common cause, leading to the term \"diplobacillary conjunctivitis\" due to the bacilli being arranged end-to-end. Rarely Staphylococci. Source of Infection Nasal Cavity Mode of Transmission Infection is transmitted from the nasal cavity to the eyes via contaminated fingers or handkerchiefs. Pathology The bacillus produces proteolytic enzymes that macerate the epithelium, resulting in mild chronic inflammation and eczematous changes in the skin around the eye angles. Symptoms Irritation Burning sensation Discomfort in the eyes Signs Hyperemia of the bulbar conjunctiva and lid margins near the angles Excoriation of the skin around the angles Foamy mucopurulent discharge at the angles Image Complications Blepharitis Shallow marginal catarrhal corneal ulceration Treatment Oxytetracycline (1%) eye ointment applied 2-3 times a day for 9-14 days.

Acute Mucopurulent Conjunctivitis: M/c cause: Staphylococcus aureus Symptoms: Redness Mucus discharge Eyelids stick together, especially in the morning Treatment: Topical Antibiotics: Broad-spectrum antibiotics (e.g., chloramphenicol, lomefloxacin, ofloxacin, ciprofloxacin) applied 4-6 times daily. Antibiotic ointment for lid application to prevent sticking and manage discharge. Acute Purulent Conjunctivitis/ Hyperacute conjunctivitis/ Acute blennorrhoea: M/c cause: Neisseria gonorrhoeae Symptoms: Fiery red conjunctiva (‘pink eye’) Severe pain Lid swelling Copious purulent discharge Pus seen in the fornices and margin of the lid Matting of lashes with dirty yellow crust Coloured halos Tender preauricular lymphadenopathy Treatment: Systemic Antibiotics: Single dose Ceftriaxone IM and oral Azithromycin or doxycycline (twice a day for 7 days) Intravenous ampicillin (Option A) is not the first-line treatment for hyperacute conjunctivitis and is not commonly used. Eye irrigation with saline (Option B) might provide temporary relief but does not address the underlying infection. Systemic antibiotics are needed to prevent complications.

      "explanation": "Correct Answer: B) Allergic Conjunctivitis Explanation: Given the seasonal pattern of symptoms, bilateral itching, watery discharge, mild conjunctival congestion, and the presence of small papillae point toward the diagnosis of allergic conjunctivitis. Conjunctival inflammatory reactions can be in the form of: Follicles Papillae Granuloma Yellowish-white, round elevations, 1-2 mm in diameter, due to lymphocyte aggregations in the subepithelial adenoid layer. Conjunctiva of newborns cannot produce follicles until 2-3 months of age. Hyperplasia of the normal vascular system with glomerulus-like bunches of capillaries growing into the epithelium. Fleshy, sessile, or pedunculated lesions with inflammatory tissue. May or may not be truly granulomatous. Resulting from chronic local irritation, such as foreign bodies. Viral Conjunctivitis (Option A) typically presents with watery discharge and moderate conjunctival congestion. It is often associated with follicles rather than papillae, and a seasonal pattern is less likely than that of allergic conjunctivitis. Bacterial Conjunctivitis (Option C) is characterized by purulent discharge and marked conjunctival congestion. While bacterial conjunctivitis can sometimes present with papillae, these are not usually as prominent or marked as those in allergic conjunctivitis. Chlamydial Conjunctivitis (Option D) typically presents with mucopurulent discharge and moderate conjunctival congestion. It is often associated with follicles, and papillae may or may not be present. The lack of prominent papillae and specific seasonal patterns make it less likely than allergic conjunctivitis.",
