Snellen’s chart Measures visual acuity by assessing the eye's ability to distinguish details or separate points. Rows of decreasing-sized letters fit within squares. Each letter subtends an angle of 5 minutes, and the lines forming letters subtend 1 minute of arc. Visual Acuity Notation Snellen Fraction: Denoted as a fraction, with the numerator being 6 meters and the denominator indicating the distance at which normal vision reads the same letter (e.g., 6/18 means the patient reads at 6 meters what normal vision reads at 18 meters). Metric/Imperial: 6/6 = 20/20 vision. Decimal Acuity: 6/6 equals 1.0 decimal acuity. Testing Procedure The patient is positioned 6 meters from the chart, and each eye is tested individually, starting with the right eye. The patient reads the smallest visible letter. Limitations Refractive Errors: Primarily measures uncorrected vision. Pinhole tests help detect refractive errors that can be corrected with lenses. Subjectivity: Dependent on patient literacy, language, and cognitive ability. Scope: Assesses only visual acuity, not contrast sensitivity, color vision, or peripheral vision.",

      "explanation": "disturbances in vision, including red-green colour vision defect. Acquired colour blindness: Loss or alteration of colour vision due to external factors, typically involving damage to the eyes, optic nerve, or brain rather than a genetic cause. Unlike congenital colour blindness, which is present from birth, acquired colour blindness can develop at any point in life and maybe progressive or reversible, depending on the underlying cause. Associated with central scotoma or decreased visual acuity Causes : Ocular Diseases: Conditions such as glaucoma, cataracts, age-related macular degeneration, diabetic retinopathy, and optic neuritis. Neurological Disorders: Multiple sclerosis, optic nerve damage, or brain lesions in areas responsible for colour perception. Drug Toxicity: Certain medications, such as deferoxamine, hydroxychloroquine, sildenafil, ethambutol or digoxin can induce colour vision defects. Chemical Exposure: Long-term exposure to industrial solvents, heavy metals, or other toxins. Trauma: Head or eye injuries that affect the visual pathways. Types : Blue-yellow impairment: Seen in retinal lesions (CSR, macular oedema, shallow retinal detachment) Red-green deficiency: Seen in optic nerve lesions (optic neuritis, Leber's optic atrophy, compression of optic nerve) IIIIIIIII Acquired blue colour defect (blue blindness): Occur in old age due to increased sclerosis of the crystalline lens. Retinal vein occlusion (Option A) typically causes sudden vision loss, often associated with retinal hemorrhages, but does not cause a specific color vision defect in isolation. Diabetic retinopathy (Option C) causes gradual vision loss due to retinal changes (like microaneurysms, hemorrhages, and edema) but does not typically present with acute color vision defects like those seen in optic neuritis. Macular degeneration (Option D) primarily affects central vision and may cause difficulty with reading or recognizing faces but does not typically cause red-green color vision defects.

      "explanation": "suggests a problem with contrast sensitivity. The Letter Contrast Sensitivity Test is specifically designed to evaluate how well the patient can distinguish between varying contrasts, which is often impacted in conditions like post-cataract surgery or early-stage optic nerve diseases. Contrast sensitivity tests assess the smallest contrast a person can distinguish, offering insight into visual quality beyond standard visual acuity. Two main methods are used: Letter Contrast Sensitivity Tests Modified visual acuity charts with decreasing contrast (from 50% to 4%). Commonly used charts include the Pelli-Robson and Regan charts. Patients, placed 1 meter away, identify the smallest visible letter. Piel Robson Chart Contrast Sensitivity Grating Tests Present sinusoidal pattern gratings (bars) where patients determine tilt direction. Contrast and spatial frequency (bar spacing) are key variables. Cambridge contrast sensitivity gratings involve identifying patterns until they blend with a blank card. Snellen Chart (Option A) measures visual acuity but does not assess the ability to see in low-contrast situations. The Ishihara Test (Option B) evaluates color vision, not contrast sensitivity. The Visual Field Test (Option D) checks for peripheral vision defects, which are unrelated to contrast sensitivity.",

      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Correct answer: B) Refractive error Explanation: The pinhole test reduces the amount of light scattering in the eye and sharpens vision by narrowing the beam of light entering the pupil. An improvement in vision suggests a refractive error , such as myopia or astigmatism, that can be corrected with lenses. Pinhole Test Stenopeic Slit Test Mechanism Uses a small opaque disc with holes to reduce retinal blur and improve visual acuity in refractive errors up to 4D. Uses a narrow slit to reduce peripheral aberrations and enhance depth of focus. Clinical Applications Determines if reduced vision is due to refractive errors; vision improvement suggests a refractive issue. (Option B) Quick assessment of visual acuity, often in under-resourced settings. WHO recommended blindness surveys. To assess astigmatism, especially irregular astigmatism (as it allows for a more detailed analysis of the patient's visual field by focusing light along a single axis) or complex visual issues. A stenopeic slit is used in cases of corneal opacities to help identify the best location for an optical iridectomy. Limitations Can underestimate post-refractive visual acuity. Reduces light reaching the retina, potentially causing",
