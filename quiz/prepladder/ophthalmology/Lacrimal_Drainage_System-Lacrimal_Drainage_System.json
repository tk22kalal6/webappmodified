        "A": "Valve of Hasner",
        "B": "The valve of Rosenmüller",

      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "opens into the inferior meatus of the nose. Its primary function is to prevent the retrograde flow of fluid from the nasal cavity into the nasolacrimal duct, which is particularly important during actions like nose blowing. This valve ensures that tears drain properly from the eye into the nasal cavity without backflow. The valve of Rosenmüller (Option B) is a mucosal fold located at the junction where the common canaliculus (formed by the superior and inferior canaliculi) opens into the lacrimal sac. This valve is responsible for preventing the backward flow of tears from the lacrimal sac into the canaliculi, thereby maintaining the forward movement of tears toward the nasolacrimal duct. Orbital Lobe (Option C) is one of the two lobes of the main lacrimal gland, which is involved in the production of reflex tears. It is located in the lacrimal fossa of the frontal bone and plays no role in the prevention of backflow within the lacrimal passages. Glands of Krause (Option D) are accessory lacrimal glands found in the conjunctival fornices. They are responsible for producing basal tears, which help maintain eye moisture. These glands do not participate in preventing backflow within the lacrimal drainage system.",

      "question": "Which of the following is a cause of lacrimal pump failure, leading to excessive tearing (epiphora)?",
      "options": {
        "A": "Trauma to the canaliculus",
        "B": "Bell’s palsy",
        "C": "Obstruction of the nasolacrimal duct",
        "D": "Narrowing of the punctum"
      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Correct answer: B) Bell’s palsy Explanation: The lacrimal pump mechanism relies on the proper function of the orbicularis oculi muscle and the correct positioning of the punctum. In Bell’s palsy, Weakness of the orbicularis oculi muscle prevents proper eyelid closure and tear drainage, as the orbicularis oculi muscle is involved in both the tear suction and drainage phase of the lacrimal pump mechanism. This leads to epiphora (excessive tearing). Clinical evaluation for Watering Eye (Epiphora): Eyelid and Punctal Examination : Eversion of the punctum can be observed in ectropion or lax eyelids. Fluorescein Dye Test: This test can help assess the tear drainage system by observing the time it takes for dye to disappear from the eye. Lacrimal Syringing test : Testing with probing or syringing may help identify blockages in the tear drainage system, such as in the canaliculi or nasolacrimal duct. Trauma to the canaliculus (Option A): While an injury to the canaliculus can block the tear drainage system, it does not directly disrupt the lacrimal pump mechanism. Trauma may cause scar formation or narrowing, but it primarily impacts tear flow through mechanical obstruction rather than pump function. Obstruction of the nasolacrimal duct (Option C): This condition involves a blockage in the nasolacrimal duct, preventing proper tear drainage. However, it is considered a mechanical obstruction rather than a lacrimal pump failure. Narrowing of the punctum (Option D): Punctal stenosis refers to a narrowing or closure of the punctum (the opening at the corner of the eyelid that drains tears). While this causes tear accumulation, it results from a physical obstruction at the punctum, not from a dysfunction of the lacrimal pump mechanism.",

      "question": "A 65 y/o male presents with persistent tearing in his right eye that has worsened over the past year. The physician orders an imaging study to pinpoint the exact location of the blockage and assess the condition of the lacrimal sac. Which investigation is most appropriate for this purpose?",
      "options": {
        "A": "Dacryocystography",
        "B": "Fluorescein Dye Disappearance Test (FDDT)",
        "C": "Dacryoscintigraphy",
        "D": "Lacrimal Syringing"
      },
      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "Correct answer: A) Dacryocystography Explanation: Dacryocystography(DCG) provides highly detailed anatomical information about the entire lacrimal drainage system. By injecting contrast dye into the lacrimal sac and taking X-rays, DCG can precisely identify the site, extent, and nature of the blockage, making it the investigation of choice when anatomical clarity is required. Fluorescein Dye Disappearance Test (FDDT) (Option B): 2 drops of the Fluorescein dye are injected into both the conjunctival sacs. It usually disappears in 2 minutes in the normal eye. Longer retention of the dye indicates any obstruction or dysfunction in tear flow. It is mainly used to assess the overall efficiency of tear drainage and does not provide information on the exact location or nature of any obstruction within the lacrimal system. Dacryoscintigraphy (Option C) or lacrimal scintillography is a functional test that evaluates the rate at which tears flow through the lacrimal drainage system by tracking a radioactive tracer. While it is useful for identifying functional delays or blockages, it lacks the anatomical precision needed to determine the exact location or cause of the obstruction. Lacrimal Syringing (Option D): Normal saline is injected into the lacrimal sac using a syringe. No obstruction : Free passage through the lacrimal passages & the nose Partial obstruction : Saline passes with resistance and pressure. Complete obstruction : No fluid passes. If fluid refluxes through the same punctum: Obstruction in the same or common canaliculus. If fluid refluxes through the opposite punctum: Obstruction in the lower sac or NLD. Although it can identify the degree of blockage & approximate blockage site, it does not offer detailed anatomical information.",

      "question": "A 50 y/o man undergoes Jones Test 1 for chronic tearing, which shows no dye on the cotton bud placed in the inferior meatus. Following this, Jones Test 2 is performed, and fluorescein dye is detected after lacrimal syringing. What does this result suggest?",
      "options": {
        "A": "Partial obstruction within the lacrimal passages",
        "B": "Complete obstruction of the nasolacrimal duct",
        "C": "Lacrimal pump failure",
        "D": "Primary hypersecretion of tears"
      },
      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: A) Partial obstruction within the lacrimal passages Explanation: A positive Jones Test 2 indicates that the fluorescein dye was able to enter the lacrimal sac but could not reach the nasal cavity without syringing. This finding is typical of a partial blockage somewhere along the lacrimal drainage system, allowing some tear flow but not enough for normal drainage. Jones Test 1: Purpose : To distinguish between partial obstruction and excessive tear production. Procedure : Fluorescein dye is placed in the conjunctival sac, and after 5 minutes, a cotton bud soaked in anaesthetic is placed in the inferior meatus inside the nose. The cotton bud is checked for dye. Interpretation: Positive: Dye on the cotton bud indicates patent tear drainage and suggests hypersecretion. Negative: No dye indicates potential drainage issues, requiring further testing with Jones Test. Jones Test 2: Purpose: Performed if Jones Test 1 is negative to differentiate between partial obstruction and pump failure. Procedure: Lacrimal syringing is done while the cotton bud remains in the nose. Interpretation: Positive: Dye flushed onto the cotton bud indicates partial obstruction. Negative: No dye suggests lacrimal pump failure. Complete obstruction of the nasolacrimal duct (Option B): In the case of a complete obstruction, the dye would not move at all, even with syringing. Therefore, no dye would be detected in the nose after jones test 2, which is different from the positive result in this patient. Lacrimal pump failure (Option C) would result in a negative Jones Test 2, meaning that the dye wouldn't move into the nose even with syringing, because the pumping action of the lacrimal system is impaired. Primary hypersecretion of tears (Option D) would present with a positive Jones Test 1, where the dye would naturally pass through the lacrimal system and into the nose without any obstruction. A negative Jones Test 1 followed by a positive Jones Test 2 makes this diagnosis unlikely.",

      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: B) Probing of the nasolacrimal duct IIIIIII nasolacrimal duct obstruction (CNLDO), persistent symptoms beyond 6–8 months of age, despite conservative management (e.g., Crigler massage and antibiotics), warrant nasolacrimal duct probing . Since this child is 9 months old with no response to massage and antibiotics , the next step is probing , which is often successful when done before 12 months. Congenital Nasolacrimal Duct Obstruction (CNLDO): Aspect Details Definition Blockage of the nasolacrimal duct, usually at the valve of Hasner Typical Age Present from birth or early infancy Symptoms • Chronic tearing (epiphora) • Discharge • Recurrent conjunctivitis First-Line Management • Crigler massage to open the duct • Topical antibiotics for infection Indications for Probing • Persistence beyond 6–10 months • Repeated infections or failure of conservative therapy Prognosis with Probing >90% success if performed before 12–15 months Continue massage and antibiotics (Option A): Incorrect because symptoms have already persisted beyond the expected resolution time despite these measures. Dacryocystorhinostomy (DCR) (Option C): Incorrect as DCR is reserved for older children or adults when probing and intubation fail. Balloon catheter dilation (Option D): Incorrect because balloon dacryoplasty is typically considered for recurrent or failed probing , not first-line.

      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "the inner corner of the eye, providing direct access to the lacrimal sac and nasal mucosa. It is widely done due to its high success rate , which exceeds 90% . However, it leaves a visible scar and may result in greater blood loss compared to other methods. Endonasal Dacryocystorhinostomy (Endonasal DCR) (Option B) involves using an endoscope inserted through the nasal cavity to create a drainage opening, thus avoiding any external incision. While it has the advantage of being scarless and typically involves less bleeding, its success rate is slightly lower, ranging between 70-90%. Endocanalicular Laser Dacryocystorhinostomy (Laser DCR) (Option C): This method utilizes a laser passed through the canaliculli to create a drainage opening. It is minimally invasive and can be performed quickly under local anaesthesia. However, its success rate is lower than external or endonasal DCR, around 70%, and patients often require additional surgery if the initial procedure fails. Conjunctivodacryocystorhinostomy (CDCR) (Option D): CDCR is specifically used when both the canaliculi and the nasolacrimal duct are blocked. It is a more specialized procedure compared to standard DCR and is not typically the first choice for isolated nasolacrimal duct obstruction. CDCR involves creating a passage directly from the conjunctival sac to the nasal cavity, often using a Jones tube and is reserved for more complex cases where the canaliculi are also involved.",

      "question": "A 2-week-old infant presents with a bluish swelling in the inner corner of the right eye. The parents report excessive tearing and some slimy discharge from the eye. There is no history of trauma or illness. What is the most likely diagnosis?",
      "options": {
        "A": "Congenital Dacryocele",
        "B": "Dacryoadenitis",
        "C": "Dacryops",
        "D": "Chronic Dacryocystitis"
      },
      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "Correct answer: A) Congenital Dacryocele Explanation: The bluish swelling in the inner corner of the eye, along with excessive tearing and mucous discharge, is characteristic of congenital dacryocele. Congenital Dacryocele: A condition where obstruction of the nasolacrimal duct causes amniotic fluid accumulation in the lacrimal sac, leading to a cystic swelling below the inner corner of the eye. Aetiology: Obstruction : Blockage at the Hasner valve (distal end) and Rosenmuller valve (proximal end) of the nasolacrimal duct. Demographics : More common in females; can be unilateral or bilateral. Clinical Features: Bluish or greyish cystic swelling in the medial canthal area, noticeable at birth or shortly thereafter. Epiphora: Excessive tearing due to blocked tear drainage. Dacryocystitis: Inflammation or infection of the lacrimal sac. Conjunctival Discharge: Mucous or purulent discharge from the eye, with possible redness and irritation. Treatment: Conservative Management : Digital Massage: Gentle massage to relieve obstruction. Topical Antibiotics: To prevent or treat infections. Warm Compresses: Applied to promote drainage and comfort. Surgical Intervention : Probing of the Nasolacrimal Duct: Clears obstruction, typically performed under general anaesthesia. Nasal Endoscopy: Checks for and addresses any nasal cysts or obstructions if needed. Dacryoadenitis (Option B) typically presents with a painful, red swelling of the outer third of the upper eyelid, often associated with systemic infections. The described swelling is not painful and is located in the medial canthal area. Dacryops (Option C) presents as a cystic swelling in the upper fornix due to blocked lacrimal ducts and would typically not be described as bluish or associated with mucous discharge in the medial canthal area. Chronic Dacryocystitis (Option D) usually occurs when a blockage leads to recurrent infections of the lacrimal sac over time. It is less likely in a 2-week-old infant presenting for the first time with these symptoms. Additionally, chronic dacryocystitis would typically involve more prolonged symptoms and recurrent infections, which are not indicated in this scenario.",

      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "obstructed for a prolonged period, leading to the accumulation of mucoid fluid. Milky or gelatinous mucoid fluid expressed from the lower punctum on pressing the swelling (positive Regurgitation test) indicates lacrimal mucocele. Dacryocystorhinostomy (DCR) is the definitive surgical procedure designed to create a new drainage pathway between the lacrimal sac and the nasal cavity, thus resolving the obstruction and restoring proper tear drainage. This approach addresses the underlying blockage and prevents recurrence. Aspect Acute Dacryocystitis Chronic Dacryocystitis Aetiology Acute exacerbation of chronic dacryocystitis Spread from neighbouring infected structures (e.g., sinuses, bones, dental abscess) Causative organisms: Streptococcus haemolyticus, Pneumococcus, Staphylococcus Stasis and mild infection of long duration Common in women aged 40-60 Causes: anatomical factors (narrow bony canal), nasal diseases, foreign bodies, infection. Clinical Features/ Sequelae Stage of cellulitis: Painful swelling at the lacrimal sac, epiphora, fever, redness, and oedema. Lacrimal abscess: Pus-filled sac, fluctuant swelling, may rupture forming an abscess. Fistula formation: Untreated abscess leads to spontaneous discharge, forming a fistula. Stage of chronic catarrhal dacryocystitis: Watering eye, mild redness, NLD block Lacrimal mucocele: Swelling below inner canthus, mucoid fluid regurgitation. Chronic suppurative dacryocystitis: Purulent discharge (d/t infection), recurrent conjunctivitis. Chronic fibrotic sac: Thickened mucosa, persistent epiphora, irregular folds. Complications Conjunctivitis, corneal ulcer, lid abscess, orbital cellulitis, facial cellulitis, rarely cavernous sinus thrombosis. Conjunctivitis, ectropion of lower lid, risk of corneal ulcers. Treatment Cellulitis: Systemic antibiotics, anti-inflammatory drugs, hot fomentation. Lacrimal abscess: Drainage with incision, antibiotics, possible DCT or DCR later. External fistula: Fistulectomy with DCT or DCR after controlling infection. Conservative: Probing and syringing (early stages). Dacryocystorhinostomy (DCR): Preferred surgery to re-establish lacrimal drainage. Dacryocystectomy (DCT): Indicated if DCR is contraindicated or in cases of fibrosis, infection, or old age. Chronic Dacryocystitis; Probing and syringing (Option A): Probing and syringing are not typically definitive for a mucocele, which suggests more advanced or longstanding dacryocystitis. Acute Dacryocystitis; Systemic antibiotics and abscess drainage (Option C): The scenario describes a mucocele, indicative of a chronic issue, not acute dacryocystitis.

      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Correct answer: C) Actinomyces israelii; Canaliculotomy Explanation: Canaliculitis is diagnosed based on symptoms and clinical findings. Actinomyces israelii is the most common cause of canaliculitis with yellow granules. Canaliculotomy is the definitive treatment to remove concretions and resolve the infection. It involves accessing and cleaning out the canaliculus to remove concretions and ensure thorough treatment of the infection. Canaliculitis: Canaliculitis is an inflammation or infection of the lacrimal canaliculus. Causes: Bacterial infection- most commonly Actinomyces israelii Other bacteria: Staphylococcus, Streptococcus, Eikenella, Lactococcus, Nocardia Fungal infections. Viral infections. Symptoms: Eye-watering & discharge. Swelling and redness near the corner of the eye Pouting or swollen lacrimal punctum Mattering on the eyelids Expression of yellow granules, concretions, or stones from the punctum when massaged Treatment: Initial: Topical and systemic antibiotics, warm compresses, local massage, irrigation and syringing of the tear duct Definitive: Surgery often required for effective treatment Canaliculotomy for direct access and curettage. Safe and effective procedure. Punctal dilation or punctoplasty with curettage Canaliculoplasty with intubation to avoid scarring Follow-up with antibiotic treatment and addressing underlying causes, such as a loose punctal plug Eikenella corrodens; Oral antibiotics and steroid drops (Option A): Eikenella corrodens is less common than Actinomyces israelii for canaliculitis. The treatment listed (oral antibiotics and steroid drops) is not definitive for this condition but rather a part of initial management. Staphylococcus aureus; Topical antibiotics and warm compresses (Option B): Staphylococcus aureus can cause canaliculitis, but Actinomyces israelii is more common. The treatment mentioned (topical antibiotics and warm compresses) is not sufficient for definitive management but is a part of initial management. Chlamydia trachomatis; Irrigation and syringing of the tear duct (Option D): Chlamydia trachomatis is not typically responsible for canaliculitis with yellow granules. Irrigation and syringing alone are part of initial management.",

      "explanation": "Correct answer: A) Pleomorphic Adenoma Explanation: Pleomorphic Adenoma: Pleomorphic adenoma is the most common tumor of the lacrimal gland. It typically present’s as a benign, painless , firm, nontender and slow-growing mass. Location: Upper eyelid or superotemporal orbit. Occurs predominantly in young adult males. Option C) Lacrimal gland carcinoma: Lacrimal gland carcinoma is a rare but aggressive malignancy with high morbidity and mortality. The most common type is adenoid cystic carcinoma (50%), followed by pleomorphic adenocarcinoma, mucoepidermoid carcinoma, and squamous cell carcinoma. Clinical Presentation: Rapidly growing , painful mass in the superotemporal orbit (months). Inferonasal globe displacement, proptosis, ophthalmoplegia (if posterior extension). Hypoesthesia in the lacrimal nerve distribution (perineural spread). Diagnosis : CT Scan: Heterogeneous lesion with irregular serrated edges, bone invasion, and calcifications. Biopsy: Confirms histology. Neurological assessment: Necessary due to perineural spread. Management: Wide surgical excision/orbital exenteration if extensive. Radiotherapy ± intra-arterial chemotherapy/brachytherapy for palliation. Prognosis: Poor, especially with perineural invasion. Option B) Lymphoma: Lymphoma can present as a mass in the lacrimal gland but often has associated systemic symptoms and can cause more diffuse swelling rather than a distinct mass. Option D) Dacryocystitis: It refers to inflammation of the nasolacrimal sac and would typically present with pain, redness, and possibly discharge, along with swelling in the lower eyelid.
