        "A": "Schiotz",

        "C": "Tonopen",

      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: B) Goldmann applanation tonometer Explanation: Types of Tonometry: 1. Indentation Tonometry: Concept: Measures IOP by how much a plunger indents the eye; softer eyes indent more than harder eyes. Schiotz Tonometer (Option A): Most widely used tonometer in the world. Advantages: Inexpensive, simple, and reliable. Disadvantages: Gives false readings in eyes with abnormal scleral rigidity (e.g., high myopes, post-surgery). 2. Applanation Tonometry: Concept: Measures IOP based on the force needed to flatten the cornea's surface (Imbert-Fick Law: P = W/A). Goldmann Tonometer (Option B): Most popular and accurate; uses a double prism on a slit lamp. Technique: Cornea is anesthetized and stained with fluorescein. Cornea and biprisms are illuminated with cobalt blue light. The prism touches the cornea, and the inner edges of two semicircles are adjusted to just touch. IOP is read by multiplying the dial reading by ten. Variable force tonometers: Goldmann applanation tonometer â†’ Gold standard Perkins tonometer (hand held version of goldmann) Draeger tonometer (measures wide range of IOP) Draeger tonometer is similar to Perkins It has a different set of prisms It operates with a motor Pulsair (non-contact tonometer) Airpuff (non-contact tonometer) Grolman (non-contact tonometer) Tonopen (based on both indentation and applanation) MacKay Marg (based on both indentation and applanation) Rebound tonometer Transpalpebral Tonometer Fixed force tonometer: Maklakov tonometer Barraquer tonometer Tonopen (Option C) is a handheld electronic tonometer that measures IOP by using both applanation and indentation method.. Pascal dynamic contour (Option D) tonometer is a newer technology that measures IOP by analyzing the contour of the cornea during gentle deformation.",

      "question": "Which of the following statements about the instrument shown in the image given below is false?",
      "options": {
        "A": "Used to measure the curvature of the cornea",
        "B": "Assess corneal astigmatism.",

        "D": "Measures intraocular pressure."
      },
      "correct_answer": "D",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer D - Measures intraocular pressure. Explanation: The instrument shown in the image is a Keratometer used to assess the corneal curvature responsible for causing astigmatism. It is based on the size of the image formed by the anterior surface of the cornea i.e., purkinje image I. Intraocular pressure is measured by using a tonometer. Keratometry An objective method for measuring the curvature of the central cornea (Option A ruled out) to estimate corneal astigmatism (Option B ruled out) . Principle of Keratometer: Measures corneal curvature by analyzing the size of the image formed by the anterior corneal surface (Option C ruled out), utilizing visible doubling. Normal Keratometric Values: Average: 45 D Keratoconus >45 D Types of Keratometers: Javal-Schiotz Model Bausch & Lomb Model Auto refractive Keratometer",
