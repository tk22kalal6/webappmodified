      "explanation": "Correct Answer: B) Episclera > Sclera proper > Lamina fusca Explanation: The sclera consists of three ill-defined layers, namely the sclera proper with the episclera on the outside and the lamina fusca interiorly . Layers of the Sclera: Layer Description Composition Remarks Episclera Thin vascularized. connective tissue. Collagen fibers Fibroblasts Blood vessels Nerves Located just outside the sclera proper Sclera proper Relatively avascular. Dense tissue. Dense irregular bundles of collagen (compared to the orderly arrangement in the cornea) Elastic fibers Fibroblasts, Proteoglycans The thickest layer of the sclera Provides structural support and integrity Lamina fusca Innermost layer. Loose connective tissue layer. Melanocytes (migrated from choroid) It contains pigmented cells derived from the choroid",

      "correct_answer": "D",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: D) All of the above Explanation: Episcleritis can be associated with systemic conditions such as rheumatoid arthritis (RF), systemic lupus erythematosus (ANA), and other systemic infections or inflammatory diseases that may be assessed with the Mantoux test ( Tuberculosis ) and VDRL ( Syphilis ). X-rays of the chest and sacroiliac joints can help rule out conditions like ankylosing spondylitis, which can also present with episcleritis. Therefore, a comprehensive approach including all listed investigations is appropriate. Conditions associated with Episcleritis: Idiopathic : The exact etiology is unknown in many cases.

      "question": "A 45-year-old woman with a 15-year history of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) presents with severe ocular pain, redness, and progressively worsening vision in her left eye for the past 2 weeks. Examination reveals a localized area of scleral thinning with adjacent congestion. There is no posterior involvement on B-scan ultrasound. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?",

        "A": "Anterior staphyloma",

      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: B) Necrotizing scleritis with inflammation Explanation: Severe pain, scleral thinning with adjacent congestion are hallmark signs of necrotizing scleritis , the most severe form of RA-associated scleritis. RA leads to immune-mediated vasculitis , causing ischemic necrosis of the sclera . Classification of Scleritis: Anterior Staphyloma (Option A): Anterior staphyloma is a late-stage complication, where uveal tissue bulges through a thinned, scarred sclera. This patient has active inflammation, whereas staphyloma occurs after chronic necrosis and healing. Nodular Scleritis (Option C): Nodular scleritis presents with discrete, firm nodules on the sclera, without necrosis. This patient has scleral thinning and avascular necrosis, which rules out nodular scleritis. Scleromalacia Perforans (Option D): Scleromalacia perforans is a form of necrotizing scleritis WITHOUT inflammation (painless, non-red eye). This patient has severe pain and congestion, so active necrotizing scleritis is the correct choice.",

      "explanation": "Correct Answer: B) Non-necrotizing anterior diffuse scleritis Explanation: Clinical presentation of persistent eye discomfort, watering, diffuse redness, and tenderness without localized necrosis or thinning is characteristic of non-necrotizing anterior diffuse scleritis. Anterior Scleritis: Most common in elderly female patients ( 40-70 years) Etiology : Associated with connective tissue disease (50% of cases) Clinical classification: Non-necrotizing anterior scleritis Diffuse Nodular Necrotizing anterior scleritis With inflammation Without inflammation Non-necrotizing anterior scleritis: Pain, redness, watering, discharge, and bluish or brownish discoloration. Nodular: One or more dark red or bluish nodules, which later become purple and semitransparent like porcelain. (Option C ruled out) Diffuse ( most common ): Diffuse or localized congestion (Option B) Treatment: First-line Topical steroids eye drops Oral NSAIDs Second-line Systemic steroids Necrotizing anterior scleritis: Necrosis of sclera Severe thinning, and melting in severe cases With inflammation: (Option A ruled out) Severe form of scleritis Red, painful eye, and progressive worsening of symptoms Without inflammation (Scleromalacia perforans): (Option D ruled out) Painless scleral thinning Treatment: Topical steroids eye drops High dose of oral steroids Non-responsive cases Immunosuppressive agents Surgical treatment: scleral patch graft in severe cases to preserve the integrity of the globe due to severe thinning and melting.",

      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: A) T sign Explanation: Given the clinical presentation of severe pain in the eye, proptosis, restricted ocular movements, reduced vision, disc, and macular edema, and the potential findings of choroidal folds, the diagnosis most consistent with these symptoms is posterior scleritis . Thickening of the posterior sclera, retrobulbar thickening, and fluid surrounding the optic nerve creates a characteristic “T” sign in B-scan ultrasound. Posterior scleritis: Inflammation with thickening of the posterior sclera Clinical manifestations: Decreased vision, with or without pain Proptosis Restricted ocular movements Posterior vitiates Disc and macular oedema Choroidal folds Choroidal detachment Uveal effusion syndrome Exudative retinal detachment Diagnosis: USG-B scan shows T sign (Pathognomonic finding): (Option A) It represents the fluid accumulation between the optic nerve and the sclera It is the name given to the shape of the scleral thickening: Each arm of the T represents the posterior sclera with the stem as the optic nerve. Others-CT, MRI Treatment: Systemic NSAIDs Systemic steroids Immunosuppressive therapy Biologics: Infliximab and rituximab Moth-Eaten Appearance (Option B) : Seen in Retinoblastoma , characterized by intraocular calcifications , typically in children , not adults. Sunray Sign (Option C) : Seen in Choroidal Melanoma , due to radial vascularity , but this patient lacks an intraocular mass . Kiss Sign (Option D) : Seen in Total Retinal Detachment , where the detached retina folds inward , but this case has no retinal involvement .",

      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: A) Type III hypersensitivity Explanation: The diagnosis in this scenario is scleromalacia perforans. It is usually associated with long-standing rheumatoid arthritis and presents with scleral thinning appearing bluish and without signs of inflammation. The underlying cause of scleral thinning is probably ischemia because of vessel damage ( type III hypersensitivity ). Scleromalacia Perforans: Most common in elderly females. Pathophysiology: Associated with long-standing rheumatoid arthritis. Melting of the sclera is due to obliteration of arterial supply causing ischemia. Vessel damage is mediated by type III hypersensitivity. Clinical manifestations: Painless scleral thinning Underlying dark uveal tissue is visible Rarely perforation of the globe Treatment: No specific therapy Protection of the eye from trauma is very crucial Plenty of topical lubrication Oral NSAIDs Oral steroids Immunomodulatory agents Surgery-scleral patch grafting Reference: Parson’s Diseases of the Eye, 23rd Edition, Page 527 Scleromalacia Perforans - EyeWiki",
