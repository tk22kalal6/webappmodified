      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer C - Conjunctival invasion making a flap over cornea Explanation: Pterygium/Surfer’s eye Definition Pterygium is a triangular encroachment of vascularized granulation tissue covered by conjunctiva in the interpalpebral area . Parts: Cap, head, neck, body Degenerative process Aetiology Common in dry, sunny climates with sandy soils Ultraviolet light is a probable factor Usually elderly persons Pathology Histology shows collagenous degenerative changes in the vascularized subepithelial stroma. Pathogenesis Degenerative subconjunctival proliferation Granulation tissue proliferates as avascularized tissue encroaches on the cornea. Destroys the superficial layers of the stroma and Bowman’s membrane Symptoms Frequently follows a pinguecula Often bilateral Usually on the nasal side Impairment of vision due to: Progression into the pupillary area of the cornea Induced astigmatism by corneal flattening in the axis of pterygium Progressive pterygium: thick and vascular Regressive pterygium: thin, pale, and atrophic Ceases to grow but never disappears A probe can be passed under the lesion Can present as inflammed pterygium Signs A probe cannot be passed under the lesion Fusch’s spots/Islets of Vogt: small discrete whitish flecks made of pterygial epithelial cells seen in progressive pterygium and are also called the cap of the pterygium. Stocker line: linear epithelial iron deposition, seen in regressive pterygium. Management of pterygium: Management Best left alone Medical treatment: Tear substitutes for small regressive pterygium with dry eye Topical steroids for associated inflammation Protection from UV rays with sunglasses Surgical excision for: Progression of lesion towards the pupillary area causing excessive astigmatism and visual impairment Restricted ocular movements Disfiguring Diplopia Procedures Bare sclera technique: The pterygium is excised from the cornea and conjunctiva, leaving a bare sclera Associated with a high recurrence rate Autoconjunctival graft A piece of limbal conjunctival tissue from the same or the other eye or An amniotic membrane graft is used to cover the bare sclera Sutured at the limbus to cover the defect Surgical excision with lamellar keratectomy and lamellar keratoplasty for deeply infiltrating recurrent recalcitrant pterygia Old methods (not used now): McRaynold’s operation Postoperative use of beta irradiations Post-operative therapy and care Prevent recurrence: Mitomycin C 0.02% drops Complications like scleral necrosis, cataracts, and iritis",

Bowman’s Membrane Located just beneath the epithelium, this acellular layer is 12 µm thick and composed of densely packed collagen fibrils. It is a protective barrier to the stroma but cannot regenerate (Option B) if damaged and heals by scarring. Stroma Making up about 90% of the cornea's thickness (approximately 0.5 mm thick), the stroma consists of collagen fibrils arranged in parallel layers. These fibrils are embedded in a hydrated matrix of proteoglycans - Chondroitin and Keratan Sulphate (keratan sulphate maintains corneal transparency). Pre-Descemet's Membrane (Dua's Layer) This layer, discovered in 2013, is about 15 µm thick, acellular, and lies just above Descemet's membrane. It is strong and resistant to air penetration. Descemet's Membrane A robust basement membrane of the corneal endothelium is made of collagen and glycoproteins. It is tense, but when torn, curls inwards on itself. It can regenerate (Option A ruled out) if damaged and is resistant to trauma and pathological processes. Endothelium The innermost layer consists of a single layer of flat, hexagonal cells. These cells are crucial for maintaining corneal transparency by regulating fluid balance within the cornea through an active pump mechanism.",

      "explanation": "Effective in the early stages, but contact lenses are more beneficial. Less effective in later stages due to irregular astigmatism. Contact Lenses : Rigid gas permeable lenses improve vision in early cases. Specially designed scleral lenses (e.g., Rose-K) are useful in early to moderate cases. Corneal Collagen Cross-Linking (CXL) (Option A) : New treatment modality to slow disease progression. Involves riboflavin (0.1%) eye drops and UVA radiation. Riboflavin induces cross-linking of corneal collagen to stabilize the stroma and improve contact lens tolerance. Keratoplasty : Recommended if disease progresses or in cases of acute hydrops (Descemet's membrane tear). Reserved for more advanced diseases or when other treatments fail. Penetrating keratoplasty is common, but Deep Anterior Lamellar Keratoplasty (DALK) is preferred if Descemet's membrane and endothelium are intact, reducing rejection risk. Intracorneal Ring Segments (INTACS) : Effective in early to moderate cases by flattening the cornea. Less effective in halting progression.

Poor Lens Storage Conditions Examination Findings in Acanthamoeba Keratitis: Symptoms: Blurred Vision: Common in corneal conditions due to the disruption of the cornea's transparent surface. Discomfort: Significant discomfort in the affected eye. Severe Pain: Pain is often out of proportion to clinical signs, a key clinical clue. Signs: Early Disease: Irregular and Greyish Epithelium : Early sign indicating amoebic invasion. Pseudodendrites : Lesions resembling herpetic keratitis Limbitis and Stromal Infiltrates : Inflammation at the corneal-scleral junction with diffuse or focal infiltrates in the anterior stroma. Perineural Infiltrates (Radial Keratoneuritis) : Hallmark sign, radial streaks extending towards the cornea's centre, pathognomonic for Acanthamoeba keratitis. Advanced Disease: Ring Abscess : Characteristic of advanced infection, where infiltrates form a ring-shaped abscess. Stromal Opacification and Vascularisation : Corneal opacity and new blood vessel growth, leading to significant vision impairment. Corneal Melting : Serious complication where corneal tissue breaks down, often at the infiltrate edges. Scleritis : Reactive inflammation of the sclera, not a direct infection extension.

      "explanation": "history of chickenpox and cutaneous lesions seen along the course of trigeminal nerve is suggestive of Herpes zoster ophthalmicus. Herpes Zoster Ophthalmicus (HZO) Affects the ophthalmic branch of the trigeminal nerve. Anterior uveitis occurs in 40-50% of cases, usually within 2 weeks of skin rash onset. Symptoms: mild iritis, vesicular rash on the nose, small KPs, mild aqueous flare, possible hemorrhagic hypopyon. Complications: iris atrophy, secondary glaucoma, complicated cataracts. Incorrect Options: Chicken pox exacerbation (Option A) , caused by the varicella-zoster virus , usually occurs in children and presents with a generalized vesicular rash . Reactivation of the virus in adults leads to herpes zoster rather than an exacerbation of chickenpox. Drug allergy to acyclovir (Option B) , a common antiviral medication used to treat herpes zoster , would typically present with skin rashes, itching, or swelling after drug exposure. Herpes zoster oticus (Option D) (Ramsay Hunt syndrome) involves the facial nerve and affects the ear, causing pain, vesicular rash in the ear canal , and facial paralysis . It does not primarily affect the eye or lead to keratitis. Reference: Kanski’s Clinical Ophthalmology, 9th edition, Page 468-71",

      },
      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer A - Abnormal curvature of the cornea Explanation: The primary cause of regular astigmatism is an abnormal curvature of the cornea , which results in different refractive powers along different meridians of the eye. This irregularity in corneal shape prevents light rays from focusing on a single point on the retina, causing blurred or distorted vision. Astigmatism: A refractive error where different meridia of the eye have different refractive errors . Divided into 2 types: Regular and irregular I. Regular Astigmatism: When refraction error changes uniformly from one meridian to the other. ( 2 principle meridians present) Type Description With-the-Rule (WTR) The vertical meridian has greater curvature than the horizontal meridian. Against-the-Rule (ATR) The horizontal meridian is more curved than the vertical meridian. Oblique Astigmatism Principal meridians are at oblique angles (e.g., 45° and 135°), still perpendicular to each other. Bi-oblique Astigmatism Principal meridians are not perpendicular to each other (e.g., 30° and 100°). Regular Astigmatism Based on Focal Lines: Type Description Simple Astigmatism One meridian focuses on the retina; the other focuses in front (simple myopic) or behind (simple hypermetropic). Compound Astigmatism Both meridians focus light either in front (compound myopic) or behind (compound hypermetropic) the retina. Mixed Astigmatism One meridian focuses in front of the retina (myopic), and the other behind (hypermetropic). II. Irregular Astigmatism Involves multiple, changing meridians of refractive power, making it geometrically complex.Usually due to Corneal scars. Excessive eye rubbing (Option B) can irritate the eyes and potentially lead to infections like keratoconjunctivitis. Prolonged exposure to bright light (Option C) can cause eye strain and discomfort. Vitamin A deficiency (Option D) can lead to xerophthalmia characterized by night blindness and dryness of the eyes.",

When vitamin A levels are insufficient, the retina's ability to adapt to darkness is compromised, resulting in night blindness. Incorrect Options: Option A. Serum retinal <10 µ g/deciliter: While measuring serum retinol levels is a reliable test for assessing vitamin A deficiency, it is not the most sensitive screening test. Night blindness can occur even before serum retinol levels drop significantly, making it a more sensitive indicator in early stages of deficiency. Option B. Beta carotene <50 µ g/deciliter: Beta carotene is a precursor of vitamin A, and its levels can be used as an indicator of vitamin A status. However, it is not the most specific or sensitive test for vitamin A deficiency compared to night blindness. Option C. Bitot spots: Bitot spots are visible signs of vitamin A deficiency, characterized by foamy, white patches on the conjunctiva. However, they are not commonly used as a screening test. Night blindness is a more indicative symptom in the context of vitamin A deficiency screening. Reference: .",

It primarily affects young children and adolescents, particularly boys. Course The condition typically starts in childhood and may resolve on its own over 5–10 years. Symptoms Burning, Itching, Photophobia (sensitivity to light), and lacrimation (excessive tearing). Signs Palpebral Form : Hypertrophied palpebral conjunctiva with a cobblestone appearance; bluish-white color; dense fibrous tissue with thickened epithelium. Limbal or Bulbar Form : Opacification at the limbus, gelatinous thickening, and Horner–Trantas dots Pseudogerontoxon/cupid’s bow (which resembles arcus senilis) is a grayish-white ring at the limbus seen in severe limbal vernal keratoconjunctivitis (VKC). Shield ulcers are a significant complication of VKC, particularly in severe cases. These microerosions typically form on the upper third of the cornea. Mixed form: Exhibits characteristics of both the tarsal (palpebral) and limbal subtypes, typically presenting in only one eye. Maxwell Lyon's sign is a pseudomembrane formed due to excessive mucus deposition on the papilla resulting in cobblestone papillae. Histology In the palpebral form, hypertrophied papillae are observed, rich in eosinophils and other inflammatory cells. Treatment Topical therapy: Antihistamines - Levocabastine & emedastine Mast cell stabilizers - Sodium cromoglicate Mild steroids - Fluorometholone and loteprednol etabonate, Acetylcysteine can control excess mucus. Local therapy : Subtarsal steroid injections and cryotherapy for severe cases. Surgical treatment: Excision of giant papillae and treatment of shield ulcers with debridement and amniotic membrane or bandage contact lens. Cold compresses and tinted glasses for comfort. Avoid eye rubbing Phlyctenular conjunctivitis (Option B): Allergy caused by endogenous antigens → Staph. aureus and TB infection It presents with watering and itching in the eyes O/E: nodule of phlycten near the limbus and conjunctival congestion Atopic keratoconjunctivitis (Option C): Common in temperate regions and winters Dennie-morgan folds present Presence of Madarosis and Hertoghe’s sign Autoimmune Conditions (Option D): Not typically associated with Shield Ulcer : Various autoimmune diseases can affect the eyes, such as rheumatoid arthritis, systemic lupus erythematosus, and Sjögren's syndrome, leading to conditions like dry eye, scleritis, and uveitis.

      "explanation": "Correct Answer: C) Cobalt blue- Fluorescein stain- Corneal ulcer Explanation: The combination of cobalt blue light and fluorescein stain is the gold standard for evaluating corneal ulcers , making Option C the correct answer. This setup allows for optimal visualization of corneal defects and provides clear diagnostic information. Fluorescein sodium Fluorescein penetrates poorly into the lipid layer of the corneal epithelium, and therefore, it does not stain normal cornea. Although fluorescein is a very effective stain for the diseased cornea, it is more difficult to detect fluorescein staining of the conjunctiva because of the poor scleral contrast. Fluorescein absorbs light in the blue spectrum (490 nm) and emits yellow-green light of a higher wavelength (530 nm), therefore staining can be more readily viewed if a cobalt blue or yellow (blue-free) filter is used. This combination is particularly useful for detecting corneal defects and ulcers. Cobalt blue- Tryptan blue - Corneal ulcer (Option A): Cobalt blue is a filter that is commonly used in conjunction with fluorescein stain, as it enhances the fluorescence of fluorescein, making it easier to detect corneal defects. It absorbs light in the blue spectrum (around 490 nm) and helps the fluorescein stain emit a bright yellow-green fluorescence when illuminated. Tryptan blue is not the preferred or standard stain for detecting corneal ulcers. While it can stain the corneal tissue, it does not provide the clear fluorescence that fluorescein does when combined with a cobalt blue filter. While cobalt blue is useful in conjunction with certain dyes, tryptan blue is not an ideal choice for assessing corneal ulcers. Cobalt green- Rose bengal stain- Corneal ulcer (Option B): Rose bengal Rose bengal is a derivative of fluorescein and is used to detect ocular surface damage. It was initially theorized that rose bengal stains dead and devitalized tissue, but it is now thought to stain any part of the ocular surface which is not protected by an overlying tear film, specifically in areas lacking membrane-associated mucins. Cobalt blue- Lissamine green- Corneal ulcer (Option D): Lissamine green It has a high affinity for staining dead and degenerated cells, including mucous strands. The",

      "correct_answer": "D",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: D) Fluorescein dye cobalt blue filter Explanation: Fluorescein sodium Fluorescein penetrates poorly into the lipid layer of the corneal epithelium, and therefore, it does not stain normal cornea. Although fluorescein is a very effective stain for the diseased cornea, it is more difficult to detect fluorescein staining of the conjunctiva because of the poor scleral contrast. Fluorescein absorbs light in the blue spectrum (490 nm) and emits yellow-green light of a higher wavelength (530 nm), therefore staining can be more readily viewed if a cobalt blue or yellow (blue-free) filter is used. This combination is particularly useful for detecting corneal defects and ulcers. Cobalt blue filter: Cobalt blue is a filter that is commonly used in conjunction with fluorescein stain, as it enhances the fluorescence of fluorescein, making it easier to detect corneal defects. It absorbs light in the blue spectrum (around 490 nm) and helps the fluorescein stain emit a bright yellow-green fluorescence when illuminated. Lissamine green dye It has a high affinity for staining dead and degenerated cells, including mucous strands. The dye appears to stain areas where there are disrupted intercellular junctions. Use of a green (red-free) filter shows the stained areas to appear black in color. As it is better tolerated than rose bengal, it is the preferred dye for staining the bulbar conjunctiva. Incorrect Options: Lissamine green dye green filter (Option A): Lissamine green stains dead or degenerated cells and mucous strands on the conjunctiva, not corneal defects. A green filter is used with lissamine green because it enhances contrast, making stained areas appear black. It’s not effective for fluorescein. Lissamine green dye cobalt blue filter (Option B): Lissamine green doesn’t fluoresce, so a cobalt blue filter (which works with fluorescein) won’t enhance its staining. Cobalt blue is useful for fluorescein fluorescence, not for lissamine green, which requires a green filter. Fluorescein dye green filter (Option C): Fluorescein works best with a cobalt blue filter for fluorescence, not a green filter. A green filter doesn’t enhance fluorescein’s fluorescence, making it less effective for detecting corneal defects.",

      "explanation": "Correct Answer D - Removal by 26G needle In managing a patient with pain and redness in the right eye following a welding injury, the most appropriate next step is removal by a 26G needle. This approach is typically indicated when there is a foreign body present in the eye, which is common in welding injuries due to flying debris. This method is effective for extracting superficial foreign bodies from the cornea. It allows for direct access to remove small metallic fragments or other debris that can cause significant irritation and potential damage to the eye. Steroids and antibiotics (Option A): While these medications can be useful for treating inflammation and preventing infection, they are not the first-line treatment for immediate foreign body removal. Surgical exploration (Option B): This option may be considered for more complex injuries or if there are complications, but it is not the first step in straightforward foreign body cases.
