      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: C) Astigmatism Explanation: Astigmatism: Common refractive error where refraction changes in different meridians of the eye.Toric IOLs have an integral cylindrical refractive component to compensate for pre-existing corneal astigmatism and improve vision clarity for patients with astigmatism. Types of Intraocular Lenses (IOLs): Based on method of fixation in the eye: Anterior chamber IOL Iris supported lens Lenses which lie completely in front of iris and are supported in the angle of anterior chamber. (S shaped haptic) Presently, AC-IOL are used in those cases where it is not possible to use PC-IOL (made of PMMA) Eg - Kelman multiflex Lenses are fixed on the Iris, with the help of suture,claws or loops. They have high incidents of post-operative complications. Eg - Singh and Worst’s Iris claw lens Posterior chamber IOL Scleral fixated IOL (SFIOL) PC-IOL can rest in ciliary sulcus. Capsular bag fixation of PCIOL is the most ideal method. Eg - C loop type and four loop type. They are preferred in cases of ectopia lentis and inadequate capsular support. The optic of the IOL is placed in the posterior chamber. The haptic is fixed to the sclera approximately 1.5 to 2 mm from the limbus. SFIOL can be performed either with sutures or in a sutureless manner (Yamane technique). Special function IOL Toric IOL: Designed to correct astigmatism (Option C) Aspheric IOL: Designed to reduce spherical aberrations Aniridia IOL: Designed to cover defects of aniridia or partial iris loss. Based on the focussing ability the IOLs are of following types: Unifocal IOLs are the most commonly used ones having unifocal power. Depending upon the power of IOLs implanted, these can make the patient emmetropic, myopic or hypermetropic Multifocal lOLs have separate optics to focus for distance and near, so also known as simultaneous vision lenses. These are of 2 types, either refractive or diffractive optics types. These are also called pseudo accommodative IOLs. Accommodative IOLs exhibit some anterior movement of optic to improve the near vision. Available models of accommodative IOLs are: Crystalens and Synchrony lens Extended-depth-of-Focus IOL- e.g. Technis Symphony, provides uncorrected distance, intermediate as well as near vision to some extent due to its elongated focus. Myopia (Option A ): Not specifically corrected by Toric IOLs. Standard monofocal IOLs are typically used for correcting myopia. Hypermetropia (Option B) : Can be corrected with standard IOLs, but Toric IOLs are not designed specifically for this condition. Presbyopia (Option D) : Age-related condition where the eye loses its ability to focus on near objects. Multifocal or EDOF IOLs are typically used to address presbyopia, not Toric IOLs.",

      },
      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: C) Haigis Explanation: Haigis formula is particularly well-regarded for post-LASIK eyes. It uses two variables: axial length & anterior chamber depth, making it more adaptable to eyes that have undergone refractive surgery. This adaptability generally provides more accurate IOL power calculations in post-LASIK cases. Biometry: Method of calculating IOL power by 2 methods - Keratometry and Axial length Equipments used: A scan ultrasound for axial length Formulas used: SRK (Option A) Hoffer Q (Option B) Holladay I (Option D) P= A-2.5L-0.9K (L= axial length) (K= constant) Normal axial length (24 mm) Short axial length (<22mm) Long axial length ( >24.5 mm) Reference: AK Khurana Comprehensive Ophthalmology 7th edition, page 216 Kanski’s clinical ophthalmology, 9th edition, Page 316 Biometry",

        "D": "During anterior chamber maintenance with a viscoelastic substance"
      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: B) During cortical clean-up with a manual irrigation-aspiration technique is due to the mechanical stress and manipulation involved in removing residual cortex, which can sometimes lead to inadvertent damage to the posterior capsule. More common in SICS and Phacoemulsification procedures. Can occur in following situations - During forceful hydrodissection. - Direct injury with Sinskey’s hook, chopper. - During cortex aspiration. - Manual irrigation-aspiration technique. Operative complications of Cataract surgery: Superior rectus muscle laceration Button holding of anterior wall of tunnel Scleral disinsertion Descemet’s detachment Iridodialysis Zonular dehiscence Vitreous prolapse and loss Nucleus drop into vitreous cavity Posterior loss of lens fragments Expulsive choroidal haemorrhage During phacoemulsification with high energy settings (Option A) : They are more likely to cause issues like corneal edema or endothelial damage rather than directly causing a posterior capsule tear. During hydrodelineation (Option C) : This technique generally helps separate the lens from the capsule and is less likely to cause a tear if performed correctly. During anterior chamber maintenance with a viscoelastic substance (Option D) : Maintaining the anterior chamber with viscoelastic substances is designed to protect intraocular structures and reduce complications.

      "question": "A 70-year-old woman with a history of hypertension and high myopia undergoes cataract surgery. During the procedure, she suddenly experiences severe ocular pain and a rapid rise in intraocular pressure. Fundoscopic examination reveals a dark red elevation in the choroidal region. Which of the following is the most appropriate immediate management step?",
      "options": {
        "A": "Intraoperative posterior sclerostomy",
        "B": "Increase the infusion pressure in the anterior chamber",
        "C": "Perform immediate vitrectomy to drain the hemorrhage",
        "D": "Close the surgical wound and monitor intraocular pressure"
      },
      "correct_answer": "D",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: D) Close the surgical wound and monitor intraocular pressure Explanation: The given clinical scenario suggests suprachoroidal hemorrhage . The immediate steps involve closing the wound to prevent further prolapse of intraocular contents and monitoring intraocular pressure. Suprachoroidal hemorrhage: A suprachoroidal haemorrhage involves a bleed into the suprachoroidal space from a ruptured short posterior ciliary artery. If suciently severe, it may result in extrusion of intraocular contents (expulsive haemorrhage). It is a dreaded complication, but extremely rare (0.04%) with phacoemulsication. Signs: Progressive shallowing of the AC, increased IOP, and iris prolapse. Vitreous extrusion, loss or partial obscuration of the red reflex and the appearance of a dark mound behind the pupil. In severe cases, posterior segment contents may be extruded into the AC and through the incision. Management: Immediate Subsequate Closure of the incision with a suture to retain residual viscoelastic in the eye. Diagnosis should be confirmed at the slit-lamp as soon as possible. Acetazolamide to lower intraocular pressure. Intensive topical and systemic steroids to reduce inflammation, with standard postoperative antibiotic treatment and IOP management. Drainage, if subsequent hemorrhage fails to resolve (after 7-14 days, by which liquefaction of blood clot has taken place). Pars plana vitrectomy may be considered when the retina appears adherent or detached. Intraoperative posterior sclerostomy (Option A) should not be performed during the management of suprachoroidal hemorrhage because it increases the risk of complications such as infection and retinal detachment. The immediate focus should be on stabilizing the eye by controlling intraocular pressure and closing the incision. Once stabilized, further surgical interventions can be evaluated in a safer environment. Increase the infusion pressure in the anterior chamber (Option B): Increasing infusion pressure may worsen the bleeding. Perform immediate vitrectomy to drain the hemorrhage (Option C): Immediate vitrectomy is generally avoided initially as it could exacerbate the hemorrhage.",

      "correct_answer": "D",
      "explanation": "Correct answer: D) Iridodialysis Explanation: Iridodialysis, which is a separation of the iris from its attachment to the ciliary body, typically does not cause a shallow anterior chamber. Flat/Shallow anterior chamber Early Postoperative complications of cataract surgery. It may occur due to wound leak, ciliochoroidal detachment and pupil block. Flat anterior chamber with wound leak: (Option A) Associated with hypotony, diagnosed by Seidel's test.Fluorescein diluted by aqueous at site of leakage. Treatment: Most cases cured within 4 days with pressure bandage and oral acetazolamide.If persistent: injection of air in anterior chamber and suturing of leaking wound. Ciliochoroidal detachment: (Option B) Presents as convex brownish mass in an involved quadrant with shallow anterior chamber. Treatment: Most cases cured within 4 days with pressure bandage and oral acetazolamide.If persistent, suprachoroidal drainage with injection of air in anterior chamber. Pupil block due to vitreous bulge: (Option C) Occurs after ICCE and in ECCE technique due to adhesions with IOL (more common with ACIOLs). Leads to formation of iris bombe and shallowing of anterior chamber. If persistent for 5-7 days, it may form permanent peripheral anterior synechiae (PAS) leading to secondary angle closure glaucoma. Treatment: Initially treated with mydriatic, hyperosmotic agents (e.g. 20% mannitol) and acetazolamide.If not relieved, laser peripheral iridotomy should be performed to bypass the pupillary block IIIIIIIII .

      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: B) Viscoelastic injection Explanation : This step involves injecting a viscoelastic substance into the anterior chamber to maintain its depth and protect the corneal endothelium during the surgery. Extracapsular Cataract Extraction (ECCE): A type of cataract surgery where the lens is removed but the posterior capsule remains intact, allowing for various techniques to be applied based on patient age and lens stability. ECCE Techniques Conventional ECCE : Traditional method involving a large incision and removal of the lens while leaving the posterior capsule intact. Manual Small Incision Cataract Surgery (SICS) : Involves a self-sealing, sutureless incision; less technically demanding and more cost-effective. Phacoemulsification : Preferred method worldwide; uses ultrasonic vibrations to emulsify the lens through a small incision, followed by IOL implantation. Surgery Site of incision Size of incision Conventional ECCE At the limbus 8-10mm SICS Sclera 5-7mm Phacoemulsification Cornea 2.2-3.2mm Microincision (MICS) Cornea <1.8mm Surgical Steps of Conventional ECCE Eye Stabilization : Superior rectus suture for downward gaze(known as bridle suture) Conjunctival Flap Creation : A fornix-based flap will be used to expose the limbus. Limbal Incision : Partial-thickness groove across the limbus. Anterior Chamber Access : Entry with a razor blade knife or keratome. Viscoelastic Injection : Maintains chamber depth and protects the cornea. (Option B) Anterior Capsulotomy : Methods include can-opener, linear capsulotomy, envelope, or CCC. (Option A ruled out) Capsule Removal : Using forceps remove the cut capsule. Corneoscleral Section Completion : Extending the incision. (Option C ruled out) Hydrodissection : Separates the lens from the capsule. (Option D ruled out) Nucleus Removal : Methods include pressure/counter pressure or irrigating wire vectis. Cortex Aspiration : Using a two-way cannula. (I/A) IOL Implantation : Posterior chamber IOL into the capsular bag. Incision Closure : With sutures. Viscoelastic Removal : Followed by refilling the anterior chamber with irrigating fluid. Conjunctival Flap Repositioning : Secured in place. Subconjunctival Injections : Dexamethasone and gentamicin. Eye Patching : Final step. Advantages of ECCE over ICCE ECCE is suitable for all ages with intact zonules. ECCE allows for posterior chamber IOL implantation, unlike ICCE. Lower risk of vitreous-related complications with ECCE. Lower rates of endophthalmitis, cystoid macular edema, and retinal detachment with ECCE. ECCE reduces the risk of secondary rubeosis in diabetics. ECCE carries a lower risk of Postoperative Astigmatism. Better prognosis for later glaucoma surgery or corneal transplantation with ECCE.",

Stage of Lamellar Separation Earliest stage of senile cataract Formation of vacuoles and water clefts within the cortex Reversible change Can only be demonstrated by slit lamp examination 2. Stage of Incipient Cataract Detectable opacities with clear areas present between. Causes visual disturbances. Cuneiform type: Wedge-shaped opacities, extending from the equator appear as radial spoke-like opacities. Cupuliform type: Saucer-shaped opacity in the central posterior",

      "question": "Which among the following is/are true statements regarding lens proteins? α / β / γ -Crystallins are water-soluble proteins Major intrinsic proteins contribute to lens transparency An increase in crystallins can lead to cataract β / γ -Crystallin family are the largest crystallins",
      "options": {
        "A": "Only 1",
        "B": "1 & 2",
        "C": "2, 3 & 4",
        "D": "1, 2, 3 & 4"
      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: B) 1 & 2 Explanation: Lens proteins are broadly divided into soluble fractions and insoluble fractions. The water-soluble fraction consists of crystallins α / β / γ (Statement 1) , which make up about 90% of the lens's total protein content. The α crystallins are the largest crystallins (Statement 4) followed by β and γ respectively. The insoluble fraction of the lens consists of albuminoids - mainly major intrinsic proteins (MIP26/Aquaporin-0) and other cytoskeletal proteins. (Statement 2) A decrease in crystallins and an increase in albuminoids can lead to cataract formation. (Statement 3) Other proteins: HMV-3,4; accumulation of HMV-4 can give rise to nuclear cataract.

      "question": "What is the consequence of age-related decline in the Na+-K+ ATPase pump in the lens?",
      "options": {
        "A": "Increased intralenticular K+ levels and decreased Na+ levels.",
        "B": "Increased intralenticular Na+ levels and decreased K+ levels.",
        "C": "Enhanced ion exchange efficiency.",
        "D": "Reduced intralenticular Ca2+ levels."
      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Correct answer: B) Increased intralenticular Na+ levels and decreased K+ levels. Explanation: Pump leak theory: The mechanism that prevents water from getting into the lens is known as the pump-leak theory. Over the Anterior surface of the lens, Na+-K+ ATPase pumps out Na+ and pumps in K+ into the lens. The leak happens in the posterior surface i.e. ions (K+) and molecules passively diffuse across a concentration gradient . Enhanced ion exchange efficiency (Option C): Dysfunction of the sodium-potassium ATPase pump leads to decreased ion exchange efficiency, not enhanced efficiency.
