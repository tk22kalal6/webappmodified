      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: B) Levator palpebrae superioris Explanation: Congenital Ptosis: Associated with congenital weakness or maldevelopment of the levator palpebrae superioris (LPS) muscle. Congenital ptosis probably results from a failure of neuronal migration or development with muscular sequelae secondary to this. A minority of patients have a family history. Characteristic features: Drooping of one or both upper lids. Lid crease is either diminished or absent. Lid lag on downgaze due to tethering effect of abnormal LPS muscle. Types of congenital ptosis: 1. Simple congenital ptosis: Unilateral or bilateral Non-progressive No fluctuation: Unlike myogenic ptosis, congenital ptosis does not worsen throughout the day or improve with rest. 2. Congenital ptosis with associated weakness of superior rectus muscle. 3. Blepharophimosis syndrome: Congenital ptosis Blepharophimosis Telecanthus Epicanthus inversus. 4. Congenital synkinetic ptosis (Marcus Gunn jaw-winking ptosis) Retraction of the ptotic lid with jaw movements due to stimulation of ipsilateral pterygoid muscle. It occurs due to trigemino-oculomotor synkinesis. The pathophysiology of Marcus Gunn Jaw winking phenomenon is a congenital misdirection of mandibular branch of trigeminal nerve, i.e., this synkinetic movement results from a congenital aberrant connection between motor branches of the trigeminal nerve controlling muscles of mastication and superior division of the oculomotor nerve controlling the levator palpebrae superioris.

      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: B) Presents with normal function of the levator muscle Explanation: Acquired Aponeurotic Ptosis: Develops due to defect of levator aponeurosis in the presence of a normal functioning muscle. Also known as involutional ptosis. It includes: Senile Ptosis Postoperative Ptosis Ptosis associated with blepharochalasis. Traumatic dehiscence or disinsertion of aponeurosis. Accompanied by ocular motor dysfunction (Option A): Aponeurotic ptosis is not associated with ocular motor dysfunction, which is more common in neurological forms of ptosis. Results from a neurological condition affecting the third cranial nerve (Option C): This describes ptosis due to cranial nerve III palsy, not aponeurotic ptosis. Usually involves a sudden onset of symptoms (Option D): Aponeurotic ptosis generally has a gradual onset rather than sudden, distinguishing it from other types of ptosis that may present more abruptly.

      "explanation": "Correct Answer: B) Myasthenia gravis Explanation: Myasthenia gravis is a neuromuscular disorder characterized by weakness in voluntary muscles, which worsens with activity and improves with rest. It often presents with ptosis, diplopia, and generalized muscle weakness. Myogenic ptosis is caused by a myopathy of the levator muscle itself, or by impairment of transmission of impulses at the neuromuscular junction (neuromyopathic). Acquired Myogenic Ptosis: Occurs due to acquired disorders of the LPS muscle or the myoneural junction. Acquired myogenic ptosis occurs in myasthenia gravis, myotonic dystrophy and progressive external ophthalmoplegia It is seen in conditions like: Myasthenia gravis (M/C) Dystrophia myotonica Ocular myopathy Oculopharyngeal muscular dystrophy Thyrotoxicosis Lambert Eaton myasthenic syndrome Trauma to LPS muscle Horner's Syndrome (Option A): Mild, constant ptosis which does not worsen with activity or improve with rest and no generalized fatigue or double vision.
