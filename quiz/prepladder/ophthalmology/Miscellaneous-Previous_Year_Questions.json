      "explanation": "Correct Answer: D) Eye speculum Explanation: An eye speculum is a surgical instrument used to hold the eyelids apart during ophthalmic procedures. It ensures proper exposure of the eye, facilitating examination or surgery, like enucleation. Eye speculum Doyen’s speculum (Option B) used in Gynaecology Universal retractor (Option A) and Mouth clamp (Option C) are used in Dentistry",

      "question": "What is the embryological origin of the corneal endothelium?",
      "options": {
        "A": "Neuroectoderm",
        "B": "Neural crest cells",
        "C": "Mesoderm",
        "D": "Surface ectoderm"
      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer B - Neural crest cells Explanation: The corneal endothelium originates from neural crest cells, which migrate during embryogenesis to form the inner layer of the cornea. Neural crest cells also contribute to other anterior segment structures, including the stroma and trabecular meshwork. Corneal Development and Cellular Origins Corneal development involves ectodermal-derived tissues. Neural ectoderm-derived optic vesicles interact with cranial ectoderm → form presumptive corneal epithelium and ocular surface epithelia. (Option A ruled out) Neural tube-ectoderm interactions generate neural crest cells, which are migratory and multipotent. Neural crest cells migrate between the lens and corneal epithelium → form corneal endothelium and stromal keratocytes. Trigeminal ganglion (from neural crest and ectodermal placodes) supplies sensory innervation to the corneal stroma and epithelium. Mesoderm (Option C): The mesoderm is responsible for forming structures like muscles, blood vessels, and connective tissue in the body. It does not contribute to the corneal endothelium. Surface ectoderm (Option D): The surface ectoderm forms the corneal epithelium, the outermost layer of the cornea, but not the corneal endothelium.

      "question": "Riya was found to have a height of more than the 95th percentile for her age and an arm-span to height ratio of more than 1.05. On further examination, she had flat feet, mild scoliosis, and long slender fingers. An image of her showing characteristic signs is provided below. What is the most common ocular complication expected in this child?",

        "C": "Retinitis pigmentosa",
        "D": "Subluxation of lens"
      },
      "correct_answer": "D",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer D - Subluxation of lens Explanation: The clinical scenario of tall stature flat feet, mild scoliosis, and long slender fingers in suggestive of Marfan's syndrome. Marfan syndrome is commonly associated with mutations in the FBN1 gene, which encodes the connective protein fibrillin. Autosomal dominant inheritance. Multisystem disorder with involvement of the connective tissues. Clinical features: Skeletal abnormalities: Tall stature Arachnodactyly Chest wall abnormalities like pectus excavatum/Pectus carinatum Thumb sign( On folding thumb, it will protrude beyond the ulnar border of palm) or wrist sign is positive Increased joint laxity CVS abnormalities: Aortic root dilation Mitral insufficiencies Arrhythmias Eye abnormalities: Ectopia lentis or subluxation of the lens of the eye (Option D) Blindness Pulmonary involvement: Increased risk of pneumothorax Diagnosis: Marfan syndrome is clinically diagnosed using Ghent criteria",
