      "question": "A 29-year-old man presents with sudden, severe visual loss following a recent road traffic accident involving chest trauma. Fundus examination reveals multiple white retinal patches near the optic disc, cotton wool spots, and minimal intraretinal hemorrhage. Based on these findings, what is the most likely diagnosis?",
      "options": {
        "A": "Diabetic Retinopathy",
        "B": "Retinal Vein Occlusion",
        "C": "Purtscher Retinopathy",

      },
      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "trauma) and is characterized by multiple retinal white patches around the optic nerve head and fovea, known as Purtscher flecken, cotton wool spots, and minimal intraretinal hemorrhage. The occlusion of peripapillary arterioles and embolization is the key pathophysiological mechanism. In this case, the sudden severe visual loss after trauma, along with the described retinal findings, suggests Purtscher Retinopathy. Purtscher Retinopathy Feature Description Etiology Trauma (head, chest), fractures, systemic diseases like SLE, pancreatitis, pre-eclampsia. Fundoscopy features Purtscher Flecken: White patches near the optic disc and fovea due to arteriolar occlusion. Cotton Wool Spots: Infarcts in the nerve fiber layer, typically restricted to the posterior pole. Retinal Hemorrhages: Small, low-to-moderate hemorrhages. Diagnostic Criteria Requires 3 out of 5: Purtscher flecken Hemorrhages Cotton wool spots Plausible cause Investigation compatible with the diagnosis Ocular investigations Fundus Fluorescein Angiography (FFA): Reveals macular ischemia, capillary nonperfusion, and optic nerve head leakage. Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT): Demonstrates retinal thickening, subretinal fluid, and photoreceptor loss in later stages. OCT Angiography: Can show retinal capillary ischemia. Management Supportive care, steroids, anti-VEGF for macular edema. Diabetic Retinopathy (Option A) is associated with microvascular changes due to diabetes, including dot-blot hemorrhages, microaneurysms, and neovascularization, but not Purtscher flecken or trauma-related visual loss. Retinal Vein Occlusion (Option B) presents with diffuse retinal hemorrhages, cotton wool spots, and optic disc swelling but is not typically linked to trauma. Central Serous Retinopathy (Option D) involves serous retinal detachment usually due to stress, without the hemorrhages or cotton wool spots seen in Purtscher Retinopathy.",

      "question": "A 30-week premature infant weighing 1.4 kg is diagnosed with stage 3 retinopathy of prematurity (ROP) in zone II without plus disease. What is the most appropriate next step in management?",
      "options": {
        "A": "Laser photocoagulation",

      },
      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "warrants close observation with follow-up rather than immediate treatment unless there are signs of progression. Anatomical classification of ROP by Zones: Zone I Bounded by a circle, the radius of which is twice the distance between the center of the optic disc and center of the macula. Zone II Extends from the edge of the zone 1 peripherally to a point tangential to the nasal ora serrata. Zone III Consists of residual temporal crescent of retina anterior to zone II. Threshold Disease: Stage 3+ ROP with plus disease. Located in zone I or II. Involves 5 continuous or 8 discontinuous clock hours. Requires laser therapy within 72 hours. Prethreshold Disease: Classified by the Early Treatment for Retinopathy of Prematurity (ET-ROP) group into two types: Type I Type II High-Risk Prethreshold Disease , requiring laser photocoagulation. Zone I: Plus disease, any stage. Zone I: Non-plus disease, stage 3. Zone II: Plus disease, stages 2 and 3. (Option A) Low-Risk Prethreshold Disease , requiring weekly follow-up. Zone I: Non-plus disease, stages 1 and 2. Zone II: Non-plus disease, stage 3. (Option C) Treatment of ROP: Laser treatment: (Option A) Done in the avascular peripheral retina. Use diode laser or frequency doubled Nd:YAG with LIO (laser indirect ophthalmoscope) delivery. Used for high-risk pre-threshold, threshold, and aggressive posterior ROP. Anti-VEGF: (Option B) Bevacizumab: Effective in patients with zone I, stage 3 ROP with plus disease. Zone I disease responds more than zone II. Recurrence can occur following cessation of anti-VEGF treatment. Pars plana vitrectomy: For tractional retinal detachment not involving macula. Cryotherapy of retina (Option D) is not preferred for stage 3 ROP, especially in zone II without plus disease. It has been largely replaced by laser therapy due to its higher risk of causing inflammation and less favorable outcomes.

      "explanation": "paracentesis are commonly used methods to dislodge emboli and improve perfusion. Treatment Goals Restore Blood Flow Dislodge or break down the blockage in the central retinal artery as quickly as possible. Minimize Retinal Damage Limit the duration of ischemia to reduce permanent damage to retinal tissue. Address Underlying Conditions Identify and manage underlying conditions like atherosclerosis, hypertension, and cardiac diseases. Treatment Options Ocular Massage (within 24 hrs) Apply pressure to the globe to dislodge the embolus; performed using a three-mirror contact lens. Anterior Chamber Paracentesis Withdraw aqueous humor to decrease intraocular pressure, potentially dislodging the embolus. Medications to Lower IOP Topical Apraclonidine & Timolol Reduce aqueous humor production to lower IOP Intravenous Acetazolamide (Option C) Provides sustained IOP reduction Vasodilators Sublingual Isosorbide Dinitrate (Option D) Dilates blood vessels to improve blood flow past the blockage Carbon Dioxide Inhalation \"Rebreathing\" into a Paper Bag Increases carbon dioxide levels to induce vasodilation Carbogen Breathing Controlled inhalation of high oxygen (95%) and carbon dioxide (5%) mixtures to induce vasodilation and slow down ischemia. Hyperosmotic agents Mannitol or glycerol (Option A&B) Rapid IOP-lowering effect and raised intravascular volume Transluminal Nd:YAG laser embolysis/embolectomy For BRAO and CRAO where an occluding embolus is visible; Good final visual results achieved Thrombolysis Local Intra-arterial or Intravenous Directly dissolve clots with thrombolytic agents; efficacy in CRAO is inconclusive. Local Intraocular Thrombolysis Use of rtPA for thrombolysis; large trials show no significant benefit Systemic Management Urgent Referral Immediate evaluation by a stroke specialist due to high stroke risk. Management of Risk Factors Smoking Cessation Reduce overall vascular risk. Cardiac Arrhythmia Management Refer to a physician for conditions like atrial fibrillation. Antiplatelet Therapy To reduce further blood clot formation, unless contraindicated.

      },
      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Edema: (Option C) Most common cause of vision loss in diabetic retinopathy is leakage from dilated capillaries. Clinically significant macular edema (CSME): Retinal thickening at the center of the macula. Retinal thickening and/or adjacent hard exudates at or within 500 µ of the center of the macula. An area of retinal thickening greater than or equal to one disc area, any part of which is within 1 disc diameter of the center of the macula. Types: Focal or Diffuse macular edema Diagnosis: Slit-lamp Biomicroscopy: Loss of foveal reflex and macular thickening Fluorescein Angiography Identifies leakage and also diagnoses ischemic maculopathy. Treatment: Anti-VEGF Therapy: Bevacizumab, ranibizumab or aflibercept. Laser treatment should be deferred for 6 months after commencement of anti-VEGF injection. Intravitreal Triamcinolone acetonide: Reduce macular edema and improve visual acuity. Photocoagulation: Focal Photocoagulation: Treatment of choice for focal diabetic macular edema (DME) not involving the center of the fovea using diode or argon burns. Grid Photocoagulation: Considered in recalcitrant cases unresponsive to anti-VEGF agents or intravitreal steroids. Burns are applied to macular areas of diffuse retinal thickening, treating no closer than 500 µ from the foveola and 500 µ from the optic disc. 2. Vitreous Hemorrhage (VH): (Option A) Seen as blood floating in the vitreous, occluding the view of the retina. Secondary to proliferative diabetic retinopathy (PDR) is a cause of severe vision loss in diabetic patients. In PDR, fibrovascular tissue lies flat on the retina or attaches to the posterior vitreous, leading to vitreous traction, retinal separation, and vessel rupture. This is the most common cause of VH in adults. 3. Retinal Detachment: (Option B) PDR causes scars to form in the back of the eye. When the scars pull the retina away from the back of the eye, it's called tractional retinal detachment. 4. Neovascular Glaucoma: (Option D) PDR causes abnormal blood vessels to grow out of the retina and block fluid from draining out of the eye, leading to neovascular glaucoma. Can cause vision loss and blindness. 5. Rubeosis Iridis: Neovascularization of iris, is when blood vessels develop on the anterior surface of the iris in response to retinal ischemia. Prone to spontaneous hyphema as the blood vessels are fragile. Treatment: Panretinal photocoagulation with or without intravitreal injection of anti-VEGF.",

Hypertensive retinopathy refers to retinal changes seen in patients with systemic hypertension. The condition's development involves several pathological mechanisms, including vasospasm, arteriosclerosis, increased vascular permeability, and raised intracranial pressure. Pathogenesis: The pathophysiology of hypertensive retinopathy is thought to progress through overlapping, non-sequential stages: The vasoconstrictive phase, Exudative phase, Sclerotic phase, and complications arising from the sclerotic phase. Vasospasm : The initial reaction to elevated blood pressure is retinal arteriolar narrowing due to vasospasm. This is more noticeable in younger patients and",

      },
      "correct_answer": "D",
      "explanation": "excessive use of tobacco, and the toxic agent is cyanide in tobacco which leads to degeneration of ganglion cells, especially in the macula . It characteristically presents with impairment of central vision, which is bilateral and progressive, with patients complaining of difficulty in doing near work and fogginess. Central vision, tubular vision, or tunnel vision refers to the loss of peripheral vision while preserving central vision. Causes of tubular vision: Terminal stage of advanced glaucomatous field defect (Option A) : The visual field loss is gradual, both centrally and peripherally. Only a small island of central and temporal vision is left. Prolonged damage leads to loss of central vision as well. The temporal island is more resistant and hence is lost only in the end, leading to loss of even light perception. Advanced stage of retinitis pigmentosa (Option B) : It is a disorder that, if sporadic, has a more favorable diagnosis with a retained central vision till the 6th decade of life. Central vision occurs in advanced cases and is lost ultimately after a prolonged duration. Central retinal artery occlusion (CRAO) with cilioretinal artery (Option C) : The cilioretinal artery is found in one-third of the eyes. It provides a second arterial supply to the fovea and hence in the case of CRAO, the central vision is maintained whereas the peripheral is lost. Vigabatrin: It is a drug used in the treatment of epilepsy It can cause vision loss in 30% of infants and causes bilateral tunnel vision in adults Vigabatrin causes damage to the central retina and leads to visual acuity Reference: Kanski’s Clinical Ophthalmology, 9th edition, pg: 529 Comprehensive Ophthalmology by A.K.

      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Correct answer: B) Disruption of VEGF production Explanation: In retinopathy of prematurity , the premature infant's retina is vulnerable to abnormal vascular growth. The disruption of VEGF production , often due to fluctuations in oxygen levels (e.g., excess oxygen therapy), impairs the normal retinal vascular development. This can lead to abnormal blood vessel formation and progression of ROP. Retinopathy of prematurity (ROP) is a bilateral proliferative retinopathy in premature infants with low birth weight, commonly due to high oxygen exposure. Risk Factors: Birth weight of <1.5 kg Gestational age <32 weeks Supplemental oxygen therapy Pathogenesis: Retinal vessels extend to the nasal edge by the eighth month of gestation but the temporal periphery vascularizes about a month after birth, by the effect of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). Premature birth downregulates VEGF, halting vessel migration. Immature vessels are damaged by oxygen exposure, causing vasoconstriction and eventually obliteration of retinal arteries and veins. As the infant grows, metabolic demands increase leading to excess production of oxygen-regulated VEGF and non-oxygen-regulated insulin-like growth factor (IGF). This leads to neovascularization and fibrous proliferation. These changes cause progressive stages of retinopathy of prematurity (ROP). Retinal Changes: Early signs: Dilatation of retinal veins, hazy white patches in the peripheral retina. Proliferation of new vessels into the vitreous from the retina, forming fibrous tissue. Progression: Retinal detachment, microphthalmia, and varying degrees of vision loss. Increased oxygen supply leading to retinal vasodilation (Option A): Excessive oxygen therapy causes retinal vessel suppression, not vasodilation. Excessive blood glucose levels (Option C): ROP is not directly caused by blood glucose levels, but by oxygen fluctuations. Retinal hypoxia leading to abnormal collagen formation (Option D): Hypoxia triggers VEGF production, causing abnormal vessel growth, not collagen deposition.

Blood Supply of Retina: The retina is supplied mainly by the central retinal artery , which enters the optic nerve on its lower surface. It emerges from the optic disc and divides into two branches to form a superior and an inferior trunk, and each trunk divides into two branches: Nasal and temporal. Venous drainage of the optic disc is mainly carried out by the central retinal vein. Retinal veins follow the arteries and drain into the cavernous sinus or superior ophthalmic vein.

      "explanation": "the peripheral retina , which is crucial for peripheral and night vision. Additionally, no abnormality was found in the posterior pole, which includes the macula, fovea, and optic disc. Part Description Posterior Pole The region behind the retinal equator includes the optic disc and macula lutea ; best examined using slit-lamp biomicroscopy or by direct ophthalmoscopy. Optic Disc (Option C) Known as the optic nerve head, it is a pink, vertically oval structure, marking the start of the optic nerve. The physiological Cup is a depression in the optic disc through which the central retinal artery and vein pass; the absence of photoreceptors results in the physiological blind spot. Macula Lutea (Option A) A dark, yellow spot at the posterior pole, measuring 5.5 mm in diameter; is responsible for central, high-acuity vision and color detection. Fovea Centralis (Option B) Central area of the macula ( 1.5 mm in diameter); contains only cones and is the most sensitive part of the retina for visual acuity. Foveola A 0.35 mm diameter shining pit within the fovea, represents the area of highest visual acuity, with the foveal avascular zone (FAZ) surrounding it. Peripheral Retina (Option D) Extends from the retinal equator to the ora serrata, examined via indirect ophthalmoscopy or Goldmann three-mirror lens . It contains rods, hence responsible for night vision. Ora Serrata The serrated peripheral margin is where the retina ends. Here the retina is firmly attached to both the vitreous and choroid. Pars plana extends anteriorly from ora serrata.",

C-wave: Positive wave, related to the metabolic activity of the pigment epithelium (RPE), observed in dark-adapted eyes. Foveal ERG provides information about the macula used in diagnosing cataracts. Interpretation Response Inference Extinguished Complete failure in rod and cone function (e.g., pigmentary retinal dystrophy, complete retinal artery occlusion, old retinal detachment, advanced siderosis). Subnormal Large areas of the retina not functioning (e.g., early retinitis pigmentosa, before ophthalmoscopic signs). Negative Gross disturbances in the retinal circulation. Clinical uses Used in diagnosis and prognosis for retinal disorders like retinitis pigmentosa, Leber's congenital amaurosis, retinal ischemia, and chorioretinal degenerations. Assessment in Unclear Conditions: Evaluates retinal junction when fundus examination is not possible (e.g., dense cataract, corneal opacity). Infant Vision Assessment: Assesses retinal junction in infants with suspected impaired vision. Patterns in ERG Pattern ERG Changes in PERG responses can occur in the early stages of glaucoma by measuring the activity of retinal ganglion cells (RGCs), often correlating with elevated intraocular pressure (IOP). Multifocal ERG mfERG aids in diagnosing macular diseases like Stargardt dystrophy, cone dystrophy, and occult macular dystrophy. mfERG or similar objective tests can be used to screen chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine toxicity.",
