      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer A - Exposure keratopathy Image in the question shows Eyelid coloboma - incomplete closure of the embryonic cleft of eyelid, the patient is at the risk of developing Exposure Keratopathy due to increased exposure of corneal area. Coloboma: Congenital eye malformations caused by incomplete closure of the embryonic cleft , leading to underdeveloped or missing tissues in the uvea, retina, or extending onto the back of the iris. Types of Coloboma: Typical: Found along the inferior aspect of the eye structures, including the iris, lens, choroid, retina, and optic nerve. Atypical: Occurs in the non-inferior location of the eye, like the upper iris or peripheral retina, which are not along the path of the embryonic fissure. Types of Coloboma and their characteristics: Iris Coloboma Pear-shaped defect extending from the pupil but not always reaching the ciliary body. It may occur alone or be associated with colobomata of the lens, choroid, or retina. Coloboma of lens Notch-shaped defect typically found along the inferior lens margin due to incomplete development of the suspensory ligament. Fundus Coloboma Oval or comet-shaped defect with a rounded apex toward the optic disc,",

      "question": "What can be anticipated in angiography as a result of the lesion observed in the image, when a patient exhibits painless reduction in vision and metamorphopsia?",
      "options": {
        "A": "Smoke â€“ stack appearance",
        "B": "Inkblot appearance",
        "C": "Collarstud appearance",
        "D": "Double circulation"
      },
      "correct_answer": "D",
      "explanation": "appearance of choroidal melanoma. It refers to the presence of two vascular networks within the tumor: an outer network supplying the tumor mass and an inner network supplying the optic nerve head. This finding is typically seen on angiography in cases of choroidal melanoma. Incorrect option: Option A . Smoke-stack appearance: This term is commonly associated with retinal vein occlusion, where the veins appear dilated and tortuous, resembling a smoke-stack. It is not a characteristic finding in choroidal melanoma. Option B . Inkblot appearance: This term is used to describe the appearance of choroidal neovascularization (CNV) in age-related macular degeneration (AMD). It refers to the leakage of dye from the abnormal blood vessels, resulting in irregular-shaped areas of hyperfluorescence on angiography. It is not a characteristic finding in choroidal melanoma. Option C . Collarstud appearance: This term is used to describe the appearance of retinal capillary hemangioma on angiography. It refers to the early hyperfluorescence surrounding the tumor, resembling a collar around a stud. It is not a characteristic finding in choroidal melanoma. Reference: .",
