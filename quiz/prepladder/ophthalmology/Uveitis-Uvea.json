        "D": "Immune complex deposition in the retinal vasculature"
      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: B) Delayed hypersensitivity reaction to melanocytes Explanation: The patient is likely experiencing sympathetic ophthalmia , a condition characterized by bilateral granulomatous uveitis following trauma to one eye . The pathogenesis involves a delayed hypersensitivity reaction (T-cell mediated) to tyrosinase peptide antigens or melanocytes , leading to non-necrotizing granulomatous inflammation in both eyes. Sympathetic ophthalmitis (SO) Definition Bilateral, granulomatous, panuveitis occurring after penetrating trauma where uveal prolapse may have been a feature of the trauma Etiology and pathogenesis Trauma to one eye (exciting eye) — 2 weeks to 3 months — Uveitis in the uninjured eye (sympathizing eye). T-cell mediated autoimmune hypersensitivity reaction to Retinal S antigen. (Option B) Maximum risk upon injury to the ciliary body. Histopathology Diffuse lymphocytic infiltration of the choroid. Scattered aggregates of epithelioid cells are seen, many of which contain fine granules of melanin. Dalen–Fuchs nodules - granulomas located between Bruch membrane and the RPE (also seen in VKH syndrome) Clinical features The exciting eye is frequently red and irritable. The sympathizing eye develops irritation, blurred vision, photophobia and loss of accommodation causing difficulty in near vision (first symptom) Anterior uveitis develops in both eyes, which may be mild or severe and is usually granulomatous Investigations Fundus exam: Dalen–Fuchs nodules, Exudative retinal detachment, vasculitis and optic disc swelling. As inflammation settles, residual chorioretinal scarring may confer a ‘sunset glow’ appearance similar to VKH. B-scan ultrasonography : Choroidal thickening and retinal detachment Treatment Enucleation of a severely injured eye within 10 to 14 days of the injury is effective in preventing or reducing the severity of SO Steroids are the basis of initial treatment. Intravenous methylprednisolone followed by high-dose oral prednisolone is given for several months and gradually tapered according to response. Supplementary topical steroids and cycloplegics may be given Reference: Kanski’s Clinical Ophthalmology, 9th edition, page 449. Yanoff and Duker Ophthalmology, 5th edition, page 770.",

The fundus has a slightly reddish appearance, mainly due to the disappearance of melanocytes in the choroid. Vogt–Koyanagi–Harada (VKH) Syndrome Definition Idiopathic multisystem autoimmune disease featuring inflammation of melanocyte-containing tissues such as the uvea, ear, and meninges. Etiology Idiopathic. HLA associations: HLA-DR1 and HLA-DR4. Classification Vogt–Koyanagi disease: Skin changes and anterior uveitis. Harada disease: Neurological features and exudative retinal detachments. Clinical features Clinically, the disease is categorized into four phases: Prodromal phase (lasts for a few days): Neurological (meningitis, cranial nerve paresis) and auditory manifestations (tinnitus, vertigo and deafness). Acute uveitic phase: Bilateral granulomatous anterior and multifocal posterior uveitis with diffuse choroidal infiltration, vitritis, papillitis and exudative retinal detachments.

      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: C) Ocular cysticercosis Explanation: The presence of a well-defined cystic lesion in the vitreous humor with surrounding inflammation , along with restricted eye movement , is characteristic of ocular cysticercosis , caused by the larval stage of Taenia solium. Inflammation occurs mainly due to the release of toxins from the dead cysts. Ocular cysticercosis Definition Infestation caused by Cysticercus cellulosae , the larval form of the pork tapeworm Taenia solium . Pathophysiology Humans ingest eggs of T. solium, leading to larvae formation (cysticercus) in various tissues. Inflammation is triggered by antigens released from dead larvae , leading to tissue damage. It is not contracted by eating undercooked pork. Clinical Features Systemic Involvement: Larvae can infest the CNS (neurocysticercosis), muscles, lungs, and subcutaneous tissues. Neurological manifestations include seizures and headaches. Eye involvement: Orbit and adnexal cysticercosis: The extraocular muscles (superior rectus- most common) form is the most common type of orbital and adnexal cysticercosis. Presents as periocular swelling, proptosis, ptosis, pain, diplopia, restriction of ocular motility, strabismus, decreased vision, lid edema and orbital cellulitis. Ocular cysticercosis: Intraocular cysticercosis can involve either the anterior or the posterior segment (more common). Presents as blurring of vision, uveitis, vitritis, scotoma, and photopsia. Diagnosis B-scan Ultrasound: Diagnostic for intraocular cysticercosis; scolex within the cyst can be identified. Serology: Detection of anti-cysticercus antibodies via ELISA. Ophthalmic Examination: Identification of cysts in the AC or vitreous, signs of inflammation or retinal detachment. Treatment Ocular cysticercosis: Surgical Treatment: Early removal of cysts via pars plana vitrectomy (PPV) or transscleral approach depending on cyst location. Steroids: Systemic corticosteroids are used to control inflammation post-surgery. Medical Management: Albendazole and corticosteroids are used for systemic infestation but with caution in intraocular cases to avoid severe inflammatory reactions caused by dying cysts. Occular Toxoplasmosis (Option A): Fundoscopy shows focal necrotizing retinitis surrounded by a distinctive “headlight in the fog” appearance. Endophthalmitis (Option B): It is usually associated with post-surgical infection, trauma, or endogenous spread . It presents with diffuse inflammation, hypopyon, and vitritis , not a well-defined cystic lesion. Posterior uveitis due to TB (Option D): Tubercular uveitis often presents with granulomas, choroiditis, or vasculitis rather than a single",

        "D": "Optic neuritis"
      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: B)Secondary glaucoma Explanation: Secondary glaucoma is a known complication of anterior uveitis, often resulting from inflammatory trabeculitis, corticosteroid response, or synechial angle closure. In this case, the patient has posterior synechiae, which can lead to pupillary block and increased intraocular pressure (IOP). Chronic inflammation can also cause damage to the trabecular meshwork, leading to impaired aqueous outflow and secondary glaucoma. Complication Description Additional Details Complicated Cataract Common in iridocyclitis, characterized by posterior subcapsular opacities with \" polychromatic luster \" and \" bread-crumb \" appearance. Matures faster with posterior synechiae presence. Secondary Glaucoma Can occur early or late due to iridocyclitis. Early: Usually Open-angle. Blockage of trabecular meshwork by exudates/inflammatory cells. Late: Usually Closed. Pupillary block causes impaired aqueous humor flow. Cyclitic Membrane Late complication where exudates behind the lens become organized in acute plastic iridocyclitis . Choroiditis Long-standing iridocyclitis can lead to choroiditis due to the continuity of the iris, ciliary body, and choroid. Retinal Complications Includes cystoid macular edema, macular scar/hole, epiretinal membrane, exudative retinal detachment, secondary periphlebitis retinae, retinal scars, sub-retinal fibrosis. Papillitis Inflammation of the optic disc, seen in severe cases of iridocyclitis. Band-shaped Keratopathy Common in children with Still’s disease and chronic uveitis. Phthisis Bulbi Final stage of chronic uveitis where the eye becomes soft, shrunken, and atrophic. Without Shrinkage: Globe shape intact, vision loss, cataractous lens, retinal detachment, raised IOP early. With Shrinkage: Lowered IOP, collapsed anterior chamber, shrunken eyeball. With Disorganization: Significant eyeball reduction, scleral thickening, possible intraocular ossification. Retinal Detachment (Option A) Retinal detachment is more commonly associated with posterior uveitis or severe panuveitis, where inflammatory damage to the retina and choroid leads to traction or exudative detachment. Anterior uveitis typically does not cause retinal detachment unless it is part of a more widespread inflammatory process. Vitreous Hemorrhage (Option C) Vitreous hemorrhage occurs due to retinal neovascularization, trauma, or severe posterior uveitis. Anterior uveitis mainly affects the anterior segment of the eye, and there is no mention",

        "D": "Cryotherapy"
      },
      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: C) Periocular injection of triamcinolone Explanation: The most appropriate initial treatment for intermediate uveitis, especially when it is idiopathic and presents with significant vitreous inflammation, is the periocular injection of triamcinolone. This approach targets inflammation locally with fewer systemic side effects compared to systemic steroids. Intermediate Uveitis: Overview, Investigations, and Treatment Intermediate uveitis is an inflammation affecting the pars plana, peripheral retina, choroid, and vitreous base, comprising 10% of all uveitis cases, and 20% in children. It's bilateral in 80% of cases and equally affects both genders. The cause is idiopathic in 85% of cases, typically occurring in the 2nd and 4th decades of life. Known causes include tuberculosis, syphilis, sarcoidosis, Lyme disease, and multiple sclerosis. Investigations Slit-lamp examination : Detects subtle anterior segment signs like low-grade flare, cells in the aqueous humor, and keratic precipitates. Indirect ophthalmoscopy : Visualizes the retina and vitreous, identifying snowball opacities, vitreous condensation, and snowbanking near the ora serrata . Goldmann three-mirror examination : Detailed peripheral retina and pars plana examination for snowbanking. Fluorescein angiography : Assesses retinal vessel leakage, especially in snowbanking or macular edema. Systemic investigations : Blood tests, chest X-ray, and lumbar puncture to identify underlying conditions like sarcoidosis, tuberculosis, and multiple sclerosis. Treatment (Kaplan's Modified 4-Step Protocol) Step Treatment Details 1 Periocular & Systemic Steroids Triamcinolone injection : 40 mg, 3 injections spaced 3 weeks apart. Oral corticosteroids: Typically considered if periocular steroids are insufficient. Gradual tapering is done. (Option B) 2 Immunosuppressive Drugs Agents : Cyclosporine, azathioprine, methotrexate, cyclophosphamide. Close monitoring due to potential side effects. 3 Cryotherapy/Indirect Laser Photocoagulation (Option D) Cryotherapy : Controlled cold-induced injury. Used for snowbanking when less invasive treatments fail. Laser photocoagulation: Focused light beam treatment. 4 Pars Plana Vitrectomy (Option A) Surgery: For severe cases or complications (e.g., tractional retinal detachment). Removes vitreous gel, and clears debris. Complications to Monitor Cataract formation Cystoid macular edema Band keratopathy Secondary glaucoma Vitreous hemorrhage Tractional retinal detachment Regular follow-up is essential to monitor and adjust treatment, minimizing complications.

Intermediate Uveitis: Causes and Features Definition: Intermediate uveitis, also known as pars planitis, primarily affects the pars plana of the ciliary body and the peripheral choroid. It mostly occurs in children and young adults, with a higher incidence in females. Causes Etiology: Nonspecific inflammation with an unknown cause. Onset: Insidious Features Common Features Less Frequent Features Floaters Macular edema Vision deterioration due to anterior vitreous opacities Papillitis or disc oedema Minimal aqueous flare with occasional keratic precipitates Retrolenticular cyclitic membranes Anterior Vitritis Vitreous hemorrhage White snowball-like exudates near the ora serrata Tractional retinal detachment (rare) Mild peripheral periphlebitis Snowball-like exudates may coalesce into a \"snowbank\" appearance. 80% of cases do not require treatment. Chronic cases may require corticosteroids; however, there is poor response to therapy. Immunosuppressants are reserved for severe cases unresponsive to steroids. Differential Diagnosis CMV Retinitis: Typically presents with focal retinochoroiditis rather than the diffuse features seen in intermediate uveitis. (Option A) Peripheral toxocariasis Tuberculosis: Typically causes anterior uveitis.

Topical prednisolone is a standard treatment for reducing inflammation in anterior uveitis. Investigations for Anterior Uveitis: Ocular Investigations: USG-B-Scan : To assess the posterior segment of the eye for any abnormalities. Fundus Fluorescein Angiography (FFA) : To evaluate the retinal and choroidal circulation and detect any leakage or abnormalities. Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT) Systemic Investigations: Syphilis Tests : VDRL TPHA : Treponema pallidum Hemagglutination Assay. Sarcoidosis : Serum ACE Levels : Elevated in sarcoidosis. Chest X-Ray : To identify any pulmonary involvement or sarcoidosis. Mantoux Test / QuantiFERON Test : To detect tuberculosis infection. X-Ray Spine : To check for ankylosing spondylitis or other spinal abnormalities. HLA Typing : HLA-B27 : Associated with various types of arthritis, including ankylosing spondylitis. HLA-B5 and HLA-B51 : Associated with Behçet's disease. HLA-DR4 : Associated with VKH syndrome and sympathetic ophthalmia. Treatment for Anterior Uveitis: Topical Steroids ( Treatment of Choice ): Prednisolone : Commonly used for reducing inflammation. Loteprednol : Less potential for increasing intraocular pressure. Cycloplegics (Topical): Rest the ciliary muscles to relieve pain. Prevent and break posterior synechiae (adhesions of the iris to the lens). Improve blood supply, leading to better healing. Non-Steroidal Treatment : Voclosporin : Part of the Luminate program, used as a non-steroidal option. For Chronic or Vision-Threatening Uveitis : Monoclonal Antibodies : Adalimumab : TNF-alpha inhibitor, used for severe or chronic cases. Infliximab : TNF-alpha inhibitor. Interferon Alpha : An option for severe cases, helps modulate the immune response. Perform a chest X-ray and initiate treatment with topical cycloplegics (Option A) : While a chest X-ray can be useful for diagnosing sarcoidosis, it usually presents with mutton fat KP’s not fine ones. Cycloplegics are used to relieve pain and prevent synechiae but do not address inflammation directly. Order a serum ACE level and start treatment with non-steroidal voclosporin (Option B) : Serum ACE levels are specific for diagnosing sarcoidosis, and voclosporin is used for non-steroidal treatment but is not the first-line treatment. Arrange for an OCT scan and administer systemic interferon alpha (Option D) : OCT scans are useful for checking Cystoid Macular Edema.",
