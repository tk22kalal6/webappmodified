      "explanation": "Correct Answer: B) Neovascularization of disc Explanation: Neovascularization (such as on the disc) appears only in proliferative diabetic retinopathy (PDR) , which is a more advanced stage of diabetic retinopathy, involving the growth of new blood vessels. Therefore, neovascularization of the disc is not part of very severe NPDR . Classification of Non-Progressive Diabetic Retinopathy (NPDR) Severity Definition Very mild nonproliferative diabetic retinopathy Microaneurysms only Mild nonproliferative diabetic retinopathy Microaneurysms plus hard exudates, cotton-wool spots, and/or mild retinal hemorrhages Moderate nonproliferative diabetic retinopathy Microaneurysms plus mild intraretinal microvascular abnormalities or moderate retinal hemorrhages Severe nonproliferative diabetic retinopathy Any one of the following (4-2-1 Rule) Severe retinal hemorrhages in four quadrants Venous beading in at least two Moderately severe intraretinal microvascular abnormalities (IRMA) in at least one quadrant Very severe nonproliferative diabetic retinopathy Any two of the following (4-2-1 Rule) Severe retinal hemorrhages in four quadrants (Option C ruled out) Venous beading in at least two (Option A ruled out) Moderately severe intraretinal microvascular abnormalities (IRMA) in at least one quadrant (Option D ruled out) Clinical Features: Early NPDR or Background Diabetic Retinopathy Severe NPDR or Preproliferative Diabetic Retinopathy Affects small retinal vessels. Earliest sign: Microaneurysm Fluorescein angiography (FA): Tiny hyperfluorescent dots. Retinal hemorrhages: Both deep, i.e., in the inner nuclear or outer plexiform layer (dot and blot hemorrhage) and superficial, i.e., in nerve fiber layer (splinter or flame-shaped) hemorrhages Hard exudates: White or yellow waxy patches with well-defined margins, often at the posterior pole, in the outer plexiform layer. FA: Hypofluorescence with dense exudates. Edema is not marked. Increased inner retinal hypoxia: Leads to multiple retinal hemorrhages, cotton-wool spots, venous beading, vascular loops, intraretinal microvascular abnormalities (IRMAs), and large areas of capillary nonperfusion. Cotton-Wool Spots: Also called soft exudates or nerve fiber infarcts. Result from ischemia, not exudation. Caused by obstruction of axoplasmic flow, leading to swelling and a white, fluffy appearance. FA: Focal hypofluorescence due to local ischemia. Venous Beading: Indicates sluggish retinal circulation. Typically adjacent to large areas of capillary nonperfusion. (Option D) Intraretinal Microvascular Abnormalities (IRMA): Dilated capillaries act as collateral channels. Bypass capillary bed and is often seen adjacent to capillary nonperfusion. FA: Focal hypofluorescence",

      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer A - CRAO Fundoscopy shows the typical features of pale retina and cherry-red spot , and CRAO is the most likely diagnosis in this case. CRAO often presents with sudden, painless, unilateral vision loss , and it is considered an ophthalmologic emergency because of the potential for permanent vision loss. Risk factors: Atherosclerosis Age Hypertension Cardiac Diseases Atrial fibrillation : promotes blood clot formation, increasing CRAO risk Mitral valve prolapse: this can lead to blood flow abnormalities and clot formation Bacterial endocarditis: causes vegetation that can travel and occlude the retinal artery Thrombophilic disorders Hyperhomocysteinemia: elevated homocysteine levels increase clot formation risk Antiphospholipid syndrome: an autoimmune disorder causing increased clot formation risk Inherited anticoagulant defects: genetic conditions disrupting natural blood clotting regulation Giant cell arteritis (GCA) Inflammatory condition affecting blood vessels, often with severe visual loss Other factors Smoking Diabetes mellitus Oral contraceptive pills Clinical features: Symptoms: Sudden, painless, profound vision loss Painless, except in GCA: GCA-associated CRAO may present with headache, jaw claudication, scalp tenderness, and/or pain around the temple Clinical Signs: Visual Acuity (VA): severely reduced, often to counting fingers or worse Relative Afferent Pupillary Defect (RAPD): Profound and sometimes total (amaurotic pupil) Fundus Examination: Retinal Whitening: Pale and opaque retina , particularly in the posterior pole Cherry-Red Spot: Bright red area at the fovea due to the contrast between pale retina and underlying choroidal circulation Cattle truck appearance: Due to segmentation of blood column in retinal veins Attenuated Arteries: Narrowed and segmented retinal arterioles Optic Disc Changes: Pale optic disc",

      "question": "In a three-year-old boy, his parents have noticed a progressive decline in coordination over the last six months. During a physical examination, a growth resembling a cauliflower is observed in the left eye, along with leukocoria and the absence of a red reflex. Microscopic analysis of the sample reveals the presence of Flexner-Wintersteiner rosettes. Which gene is associated with this condition?",
      "options": {
        "A": "Rb gene",
        "B": "ATP 7B gene",
        "C": "Rhodopsin gene",
        "D": "FBN 1 gene"
      },
      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer A - Rb gene The findings of leukocoria , a cauliflower-like growth , and the presence of Flexner-Wintersteiner rosettes on histopathology strongly suggest retinoblastoma , which is associated with mutations in the Rb gene . The question describes a classic presentation of retinoblastoma , which is the MC primary intraocular malignancy in children. The key features pointing to this diagnosis are: Age of presentation: Retinoblastoma typically occurs in young children, usually before 5 years of age. Leukocoria: This is the most common presenting sign of retinoblastoma, often described as a white pupillary reflex. Fundus examination: A white, elevated mass in the retina is characteristic of retinoblastoma. Most specific histopathological feature of retinoblastoma is Flexner-Wintersteiner rosettes , which are rosettes with a central lumen as shown in the diagram below. Histopathology and Diagnostic modalities for Retinoblastoma Histopathology Flexner-Wintersteiner rosettes (highly specific)- These are composed of an ‘empty’ lumen surrounded by columnar cells Homer-Wright rosettes - These are pseudo-rosettes and consist of cells surrounding a central lumen made up of their processes Undifferentiated tumor cells Areas of necrosis and calcification Clinical Presentation Leukocoria (60%) Strabismus (20%) Painful red eye (7%) Poor vision (5%) Asymptomatic (3%) Fundus Examination White, elevated mass in the retina Can be endophytic, exophytic, or mixed growth Imaging CT scan: Calcification in 90% of cases MRI: Better for evaluating optic nerve and extraocular extension Ultrasound: Useful for initial screening Genetic Testing RB1 gene mutation on chromosome 13q14 ATP 7B gene (Option B) : Mutations in the ATP7B gene are associated with Wilson's disease , a genetic disorder affecting copper metabolism, leading to copper buildup in various organs, including the liver and brain. It does not cause retinoblastoma. Rhodopsin gene (Option C) : The rhodopsin gene is associated with retinitis pigmentosa , a genetic condition causing progressive vision loss, but not with retinoblastoma. FBN1 gene (Option D) : Mutations in the FBN1 gene are responsible for Marfan syndrome , a connective tissue disorder affecting the heart, eyes, and bones, but not retinoblastoma.",

        "D": "Toxoplasmosis"
      },
      "correct_answer": "D",
      "explanation": "Toxoplasma gondii Toxoplasmosis is caused by the parasite Toxoplasma gondii and is a common cause of posterior uveitis. It can lead to punched-out lesions in the retina, which are characteristic of the disease. These lesions typically appear as well-defined, round areas of retinal scarring. Fundoscopy shows focal necrotizing retinitis surrounded by a distinctive “headlight in the fog” appearance An immunocompromised person living with cats is a risk factor for toxoplasmosis Toxoplasmosis uveitis: It is a protozoan infestation. Organism: Toxoplasma gondii Definitive host - cats Intermediate hosts - humans Systemic lesions are more common in immunocompromised patients Clinical manifestation: Most common cause of posterior uveitis and focal necrotizing retinitis (90% of cases) Congenital Inactive disease - Healed punched out heavily pigmented chorioretinal scars in the macular area In active inflammation - “headlight in the fog” appearance due to intense vitritis Acquired Asymptomatic Same as congenital Punctate outer retinal toxoplasmosis Treatment: Quadruple therapy: Pyrimethamine + Sulfadiazine + Clindamycin + Oral steroid Steroid eye drops for anterior uveitis Posterior staphyloma (Option A) : This refers to an outpouching of the sclera in the posterior part of the eye, often seen in high myopia (nearsightedness). It typically does not cause punched-out lesions on the retina. Fundal coloboma (Option B) : A coloboma is a congenital defect that can affect various parts of the eye, including the retina. It usually results in a hole or defect in the eye structure but does not typically present as punched-out lesions. Congenital Rubella (Option C) : Rubella can cause retinal changes in infants born with the infection, but it is more associated with \"salt-and-pepper\" retinopathy rather than punched-out lesions.",

      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: B) CRAO Explanation: The given image shows a cherry-red spot. The orange reflex from the intact choroid stands out at the thin foveola, in contrast to the surrounding pale retina, giving rise to a ‘ cherry-red spot ’ appearance. Sudden loss of vision and cherry red spots are characteristic of Central Retinal Artery Occlusion (CRAO) . Central Retinal Artery Occlusion (CRAO): Risk Factors Atherosclerosis Age Hypertension/Cardiac Diseases Thrombophilic Disorders Smoking Diabetes Mellitus Oral Contraceptive Pills Clinical Features Symptoms: Sudden, painless, profound vision loss . Painful only in GCA: May present with headache, jaw claudication, scalp tenderness, and/or pain around the temple. Clinical Signs: Severely reduced Visual Acuity (VA), often to counting fingers or worse. Profound and sometimes total Relative Afferent Pupillary Defect (RAPD), also called an amaurotic pupil. Examination Findings Fundus Examination: Retinal Whitening: Pale and opaque retina, particularly in the posterior pole. Cherry-Red Spot: Bright red area at the fovea due to the contrast between pale retina and underlying choroidal circulation. Cattle Truck Appearance: Segmentation of the blood column in retinal veins. Attenuated Arteries: Narrowed and segmented retinal arterioles. Optic Disc Changes: Pale optic disc over time due to optic atrophy from prolonged ischemia (chronic cases). Investigations Fluorescein Angiography (FFA): Delayed arterial filling. Masking of background fluorescence due to edematous retina.

Etiology: Age: most common in 40-60 years. Sex. More common in males (M:F - 3:2). Myopia. About 40% cases of rhegmatogenous retinal detachment are myopic. Aphakia and pseudophakia. Trauma. It may also act as a predisposing factor. Senile posterior vitreous detachment (PVD): It is associated with retinal detachment in many cases. Retinal degenerations predisposed to retinal detachment: Lattice degeneration, Snail track degeneration, Acquired or degenerative retinoschisis, and Focal pigment clumps. Type of Retinal Detachment Clinical Features Rhegmatogenous Retinal Detachment (Option C) 1. Floaters (dark spots) due to rapid vitreous degeneration. 2. Photopsia (flashes of light) caused by retinal irritation from vitreous movements. 3. Gradual visual field loss, initially localized, progressing to total vision loss as detachment spreads. 4. Dark veil/cloud in front of the eye , particularly when detachment reaches the posterior region. 5. Sudden, painless vision loss in large, central detachment. 6. Retinal breaks may be round, horseshoe-shaped, slit-like, or large anterior dialysis. 7. Vitreous pigments (tobacco dusting or Shaffer sign ) are seen in the anterior vitreous with posterior vitreous detachment. 8. Old retinal detachment shows retinal thinning, subretinal demarcation lines (high water marks), and secondary intraretinal cysts. Tractional Retinal Detachment (Option B) 1. Gradual, progressive visual loss 2. Typically painless 3. No associated flashes or floaters 4. Vitreoretinal bands present 5. No retinal breaks 6. Detached area - concave and localized 7. No shifting fluid Exudative Retinal Detachment (Option A) 1. Painless and sudden or gradual visual loss 2. No photopsia, holes/ tears, folds and undulations. 3. Smooth and convex with pigmentary disturbances 4. Rounded and fixed with neovascularization on the tumor summit. 5. Shifting fluid - changing the position of the detached area with gravity - hallmark feature. Retinal dialysis (Option D) involves a circumferential tear at the ora serrata, often due to trauma, but it does not exhibit the shifting fluid sign as seen in exudative detachments.",

      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "painless vision loss with a cherry-red spot at the macula is suggestive of central retinal artery occlusion (CRAO). Central retinal artery occlusion (CRAO) The central retinal artery is blocked, causing widespread retinal ischemia. Sometimes, if a cilioretinal artery is present, it can continue to supply the macula, preserving central vision even when the central retinal artery is occluded. Clinical features: Symptoms: Sudden, painless, profound vision loss Painless, except in GCA: GCA-associated CRAO may present with headache, jaw claudication, scalp tenderness, and/or pain around the temple Clinical Signs: Visual Acuity (VA): severely reduced, often to counting fingers or worse Relative Afferent Pupillary Defect (RAPD): Profound and sometimes total (amaurotic pupil) Fundus Examination: Retinal Whitening: Pale and opaque retina , particularly in the posterior pole Cherry-Red Spot): Bright red area at the fovea due to the contrast between pale retina and underlying choroidal circulation Cattle truck appearance: Due to segmentation of blood column in retinal veins Attenuated Arteries: Narrowed and segmented retinal arterioles Optic Disc Changes: Pale optic disc over time due to optic atrophy from prolonged ischemia is seen in chronic cases. Fluorescein Angiography (FA) Arterial Filling : Delayed Masking of Background Fluorescence : Edematous retina blocks normal fluorescence from the choroid Patent Cilioretinal Artery : Area of normal perfusion if a cilioretinal artery supplies the fovea, potentially preserving central vision Other Diagnostic Tests Reveals retinal edema, structural changes, and possibly an embolic plaque within the retinal artery and other systemic causes. Cranial MRI or CT Carotid duplex scanning Echocardiography Thrombophilia screening Incorrect Options: Central retinal venous occlusion (CRVO) (Option B) occurs when the central retinal vein, becomes blocked. It typically presents with sudden, painless vision loss and may be associated with retinal hemorrhages, cotton wool spots, and retinal edema. Branched retinal artery occlusion (BRAO) (Option C) occurs when one of the branches of the central retinal artery becomes blocked, leading to a localized area of retinal ischemia. The affected area of the retina may appear pale, with associated retinal hemorrhages. Branched retinal vein occlusion (BRVO) (Option D) occurs when one of the branches of the central retinal vein becomes blocked, resulting in impaired venous drainage from a particular area of the retina. It can lead to retinal hemorrhages, cotton wool spots, and macular edema.",

Earliest sign: Microaneurysm (Option B) Fluorescein angiography (FA): Tiny hyperfluorescent dots. Retinal hemorrhages: Both deep, i.e., in the inner nuclear or outer plexiform layer (dot and blot hemorrhage) and superficial, i.e., in nerve fiber layer (splinter or flame-shaped) hemorrhages Hard exudates: White or yellow waxy patches with well-defined margins, often at the posterior pole, in the outer plexiform layer. FA: Hypofluorescence with dense exudates. Edema is not marked. Increased inner retinal hypoxia: Leads to multiple retinal hemorrhages, cotton-wool spots, venous beading, vascular loops, intraretinal microvascular abnormalities (IRMAs), and large areas of capillary nonperfusion. Cotton-Wool Spots: Also called soft exudates or nerve fiber infarcts. Result from ischemia, not exudation. Caused by obstruction of axoplasmic flow, leading to swelling and a white, fluffy appearance. FA: Focal hypofluorescence due to local ischemia. Venous Beading: Indicates sluggish retinal circulation. Typically adjacent to large areas of capillary nonperfusion. Intraretinal Microvascular Abnormalities (IRMA): Dilated capillaries act as collateral channels. Bypass capillary bed and is often seen adjacent to capillary nonperfusion. FA: Focal hypofluorescence Incorrect Options: Retinal detachment (Option A) involves the separation of the sensory retina from the underlying retinal pigment epithelium (RPE).

This condition is present from birth and is characterized by a smaller size of the optic disc. While hypoplasia of the optic disc can lead to visual impairment, it is not typically associated with an expanding blind spot. Instead, it may cause other visual field defects or abnormalities. Incorrect option: Option A . POAG (Primary Open-Angle Glaucoma): In POAG, there is progressive damage to the optic nerve, typically associated with elevated intraocular pressure. This damage can lead to visual field defects, including an expanding blind spot. Option C. Papilledema: Papilledema is the swelling of the optic disc due to increased intracranial pressure. It can occur in conditions such as intracranial hypertension, brain tumors, or other causes of elevated pressure within the skull. Papilledema can cause visual disturbances and may lead to visual field defects, but it does not typically manifest as an expanding blind spot. Option D.

      "explanation": "several years before the visible changes in the retina appear. Retinitis Pigmentosa: Retinitis pigmentosa is a dystrophy of rods and cones, initially, rods are affected. (Option B ruled out) Most common hereditary fundus dystrophy. It can be sporadic (40-50%) or hereditary. If hereditary, autosomal dominant is the most common mode of inheritance followed by autosomal recessive (AR). X-linked recessive inheritance is the least severe form. Clinical features: Symptoms: Nyctalopia (night blindness) (Option D) Peripheral visual field loss Mid-peripheral superior scotoma leads to ring/ doughnut scotoma resulting in tubular/ tunnel vision. Central vision is affected in later stages (Option C ruled out) Signs: Triad of a p ale waxy disc due to consecutive optic atrophy, attenuation of arteries , and pigmentation disturbance in the form of bony spicules. Tapetal reflex: shinning reflex at macula - seen in female carriers of XLR inheritance. Atypical Retinitis Pigmentosa Atypical retinitis pigmentosa includes heterogeneous disorders that share clinical features with typical pigmentary retinal dystrophy. Conditions included are: RP sine pigmento - absence or paucity of pigment accumulation Retinitis punctata albescens - scattered whitish-yellow spots with arteriolar attenuation, usually sparing the macula. Sectoral RP - only inferior quadrants are involved. Investigation of Retinitis Pigmentosa Electroretinography (ERG) is the investigation of choice - reduced scotopic rod in early disease and reduced photopic with progression. EOG - subnormal- absence of light rise. Perimetry: initially small mid-peripheral scotomas which gradually merge and may progress, leaving only a small island of residual central vision. Electroretinography (ERG): There's a decreased amplitude of both \"a\" and \"b\" waves. (Option A ruled out) OCT- to identify cystoid macular edema (CME).

      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "proliferative changes, causing fibrovascular proliferation and subsequent tractional retinal detachment (TRD). This occurs due to contraction of fibrovascular membranes over the retina, leading to vitreoretinal traction and retinal elevation. Complications of Diabetic Retinopathy: 1. Macular Edema: The most common cause of vision loss in diabetic retinopathy is leakage from dilated capillaries. Clinically significant macular edema (CSME): Retinal thickening at the center of the macula. Retinal thickening and/or adjacent hard exudates at or within 500 µ of the center of the macula. An area of retinal thickening greater than or equal to one disc area, any part of which is within 1 disc diameter of the center of the macula. Types: Focal or Diffuse macular edema Diagnosis: Slit-lamp Biomicroscopy: Loss of foveal reflex and macular thickening Fluorescein Angiography Identifies leakage and also diagnoses ischemic maculopathy. Treatment: Anti-VEGF Therapy: Bevacizumab, ranibizumab or aflibercept. Laser treatment should be deferred for 6 months after commencement of anti-VEGF injection. Intravitreal Triamcinolone acetonide: Reduce macular edema and improve visual acuity. Photocoagulation: Focal Photocoagulation: Treatment of choice for focal diabetic macular edema (DME) not involving the center of the fovea using diode or argon burns. Grid Photocoagulation: Considered in recalcitrant cases unresponsive to anti-VEGF agents or intravitreal steroids. Burns are applied to macular areas of diffuse retinal thickening, treating no closer than 500 µ from the foveola and 500 µ from the optic disc. 2. Vitreous Hemorrhage (VH): Seen as blood floating in the vitreous, occluding the view of the retina. Secondary to proliferative diabetic retinopathy (PDR) is a cause of severe vision loss in diabetic patients. In PDR, fibrovascular tissue lies flat on the retina or attaches to the posterior vitreous, leading to vitreous traction, retinal separation, and vessel rupture. This is the most common cause of VH in adults. 3. Retinal Detachment: PDR causes scars to form in the back of the eye. When the scars pull the retina away from the back of the eye , it's called tractional retinal detachment. 4. Neovascular Glaucoma: PDR causes abnormal blood vessels to grow out of the retina and block fluid from draining out of the eye, leading to neovascular glaucoma. Can cause vision loss and blindness. 5. Rubeosis Iridis: Neovascularization of iris, is when blood vessels develop on the anterior surface of the iris in response to retinal ischemia. Prone to spontaneous hyphema as the blood vessels are fragile. Treatment: Panretinal photocoagulation with or without intravitreal injection of anti-VEGF. Posterior staphyloma (Option A): Posterior staphyloma is associated with pathologic myopia, not diabetic retinopathy. It involves progressive thinning and outward bulging of the sclera, primarily in high myopia. Retinoschisis (Option B): Retinoschisis refers to the splitting of the retinal layers, commonly seen in degenerative retinoschisis or X-linked retinoschisis, rather than as a complication of diabetic retinopathy. Progressive myopia (Option D): Progressive myopia is associated with axial elongation of the eyeball, typically seen in high myopia, rather than diabetic retinopathy.",

Caused by mutations in the BEST1 gene located on chromosome 11q13. Bestrophin, the protein produced by this gene, functions as a transmembrane ion channel in the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE). Inherited in an autosomal dominant (AD) pattern. Usually begins in childhood Clinical Features : Stages of the disease include: Pre-vitelliform : abnormal EOG, normal fundus in asymptomatic patients. Vitelliform : a characteristic \"egg yolk or sunny-side up\" macular lesion. The lesions can vary in size and developmental stage between the two eyes. Pseudohypopyon: partially regressed lesion. Vitelliruptive : Lesion fragments, visual acuity declines - “scrambled egg appearance”. Atrophic : Pigment disappears, leading to RPE atrophy. Visual acuity - stable early on but declines in adulthood due to complications like choroidal neovascularization (CNV) , scarring, or geographic atrophy. Diagnosis : Fundus Autofluorescence (FAF) : hyper autofluorescence yellowish material. Fluorescein Angiography (FA) : hypofluorescence due to lesion masking. Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT) : hyperreflective material beneath and within the RPE. Electro-oculography (EOG) : Severely subnormal across all stages (Arden index <1.5). Hallmark - normal electroretinogram (ERG) but abnormal electrooculogram (EOG). (Option B ruled out) (Option A) Best disease progresses through five stages, starting with the \"egg-yolk\" vitelliform lesion and potentially leading to choroidal neovascularization (CNV). Asymptomatic carriers may show a reduced Arden ratio on EOG, making it useful for family screening. Multifocal ERG (Option C): Multifocal ERG assesses macular function and can show localized dysfunction, but it is not the definitive test for Best disease.

Retinal Vascular Disorders: Diabetic retinopathy, central and branch retinal vein occlusion, retinal telangiectasia, and hypertensive retinopathy. Intraocular Inflammations: Pars planitis, uveitis. Retinitis pigmentosa. Vitreomacular Traction: Associated with macular epiretinal membrane (ERM) and vitreomacular traction (VMT) syndrome. Systemic Diseases: Includes leukemia, chronic renal failure, and multiple myeloma. Miscellaneous Causes: niacin toxicity , PG analogues (risk factor for development of CME) Clinical Features: Visual Loss: Initial minimal to moderate vision loss, potentially leading to permanent vision decrease if persistent. Ophthalmoscopy: Reveals loss of foveal contour, retinal thickening, a yellow spot at the fovea, and a \"honeycomb appearance\" of the macula . Fluorescein Angiography: Shows leakage and dye accumulation in the macular region, with a \"flower petal appearance\" in late frames. Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT): Demonstrates loss of foveal depression, cystoid spaces, and overall retinal thickening. Complications: Long-standing CME may result in a lamellar macular hole . Treatment: Addressing the Cause: Intravitreal anti-VEGF or photocoagulation for diabetic CME; discontinuing causative topical medications. Topical NSAIDs: Such as ketorolac, diclofenac, or profenac, are effective in preventing and treating CME. Topical/Systemic Steroids: Useful in established cases. Systemic Carbonic Anhydrase Inhibitors (CAIs): Oral acetazolamide may be beneficial, particularly in cases associated with retinitis pigmentosa. Central Serous Retinopathy (Option B) is characterized by \"ink-blot\" or \"smoke-stack\" leakage patterns on FFA, and neurosensory retinal and RPE detachment on OCT. CSR typically does not present with the cystoid pattern seen in CME. Retinal detachment (Option C) Defined as the separation of the retinal pigment epithelium from neurosensory retina. Diabetic Retinopathy (Option D): Typically shows diffuse retinal thickening and other diabetic changes, not the cystoid spaces seen in CME.",

The other causes of sudden painless loss of vision are as follows: Optic neuritis Methyl alcohol amblyopia Nonischaemic central retinal vein occlusion. Central Serous Chorioretinopathy (CSCR) (Option D) CSCR is characterized by the spontaneous detachment of the neurosensory retina in the macular region, with or without retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) detachment. Pathogenesis: Increased sympathetic drive and corticosteroids affect choroidal vascular permeability, raising hydrostatic pressure, and leading to RPE defects and serous detachment of the neurosensory retina. Risk Factors: Males aged 20-50 Type A personality, Emotional stress, Steroid use Systemic lupus erythematosus, Cushing's disease Pregnancy (3rd trimester) Clinical Manifestations: Sudden painless vision loss (6/9 - 6/24) Relative positive scotoma, micropsia, and metamorphopsia Recurrence in 30-50% of cases Examination Findings: Mild macular elevation with circular ring reflex RPE detachment (yellow-grey elevations) Absence or distortion of the foveal reflex Subretinal deposits Investigations: Fundus fluorescein angiography (FFA): Shows \"ink-blot\" or \"smoke-stack\" leakage patterns. Indocyanine green (ICG): Shows hyperfluorescence due to choroidal hyperpermeability. OCT: Shows neurosensory retinal and RPE detachment. Treatment: Conservative: Reassurance; spontaneous resolution in 80-90% of cases within 1-6 months. Laser Photocoagulation: For cases lasting more than 3 months, recurrent cases, and those with permanent vision loss in the other eye due to CSCR. Photodynamic Therapy (PDT): For severe, sub-foveal leaks, or chronic cases. Anti-VEGF: Considered if choroidal neovascularization (CNV) develops.

      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: A) Retinal detachment Explanation: Curtain falling in front of the eye is seen in case of rhegmatogenous retinal detachment. Retinal detachment refers to the separation of the neurosensory retina from the retinal pigment epithelium. Etiology: Age: most common in 40-60 years. Sex. More common in males (M:F - 3:2). Myopia. About 40% cases of rhegmatogenous retinal detachment are myopic. Aphakia and pseudophakia. Trauma. It may also act as a predisposing factor. Senile posterior vitreous detachment (PVD): It is associated with retinal detachment in many cases. Retinal degenerations predisposed to retinal detachment: Lattice degeneration, Snail track degeneration, Acquired or degenerative retinoschisis, and Focal pigment clumps. Retinal detachment can be classified into three types: Rhegmatogenous or primary retinal detachment Tractional retinal detachment Exudative retinal detachment Type of Retinal Detachment Clinical Features Rhegmatogenous Retinal Detachment Floaters (dark spots) due to rapid vitreous degeneration. Photopsia (flashes of light) caused by retinal irritation from vitreous movements. Gradual visual field loss, initially localized, progressing to total vision loss as detachment spreads. Dark veil/Curtain falling sign/cloud in front of the eye , particularly when detachment reaches the posterior region. Sudden, painless vision loss in large, central detachment. Retinal breaks may be round, horseshoe-shaped, slit-like, or large anterior dialysis. Vitreous pigments (tobacco dusting or Shaffer sign ) are seen in the anterior vitreous with posterior vitreous detachment. Old retinal detachment shows retinal thinning, subretinal demarcation lines (high water marks), and secondary intraretinal cysts. Tractional Retinal Detachment Gradual, progressive visual loss Typically painless No associated flashes or floaters Vitreoretinal bands present No retinal breaks Detached area - concave and localized No shifting fluid Exudative Retinal Detachment Painless and sudden or gradual visual loss No photopsia, holes/ tears, folds and undulations. Smooth and convex with pigmentary disturbances Rounded and fixed with neovascularization on the tumor summit.

However, in this condition, the vision loss is usually more severe and sustained, often leaving the patient with very poor vision or even complete blindness in the affected eye. The sudden and brief nature of the episode described by the patient makes central retinal artery occlusion less likely. Option C - Central Retinal Vein Occlusion: Central retinal vein occlusion results from a blockage in the central retinal vein, causing a sudden painless loss of vision. However, the presentation of central retinal vein occlusion typically involves a more gradual and painless decrease in vision, without the sudden and transient nature of the episode described by the patient. Option D - Hypertensive Retinopathy: Hypertensive retinopathy is associated with long-standing high blood pressure that leads to changes in the retinal blood vessels. It can cause symptoms such as blurred vision, but the sudden and transient nature of the episode, along with the complete loss and restoration of vision, is not consistent with hypertensive retinopathy.

      "explanation": "condition called congenital stationary night blindness (CSNB). To confirm the diagnosis of CSNB, further investigation with electroretinography (ERG) is necessary. ERG measures the electrical responses generated by the retina in response to light stimuli and can help assess the functioning of retinal cells. Incorrect Options: Option A - Dark adaptometry: Dark adaptometry is a test that measures the time it takes for the eyes to adapt to darkness and regain visual sensitivity. Option C - EOG (Electrooculography): EOG is a test that measures the electrical responses generated by the muscles surrounding the eye. It is primarily used to assess the functioning of the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE).
