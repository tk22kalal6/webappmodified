      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "obstruction is canalicular (in the canaliculus, not the nasolacrimal duct). For canalicular obstruction, the preferred treatment is Conjunctival DCR (also known as Lester Jones tube placement ). This procedure involves creating a bypass from the conjunctival sac to the nasal cavity using a glass tube (Lester Jones tube) to restore tear drainage. Conjunctival DCR is specifically designed for proximal obstructions (e.g., canalicular blocks), whereas Endonasal DCR or External DCR is used for distal obstructions (e.g., nasolacrimal duct blocks). Endonasal Dacryocystorhinostomy (Option A): T his is used for nasolacrimal duct obstructions, not for canalicular blockages. External Dacryocystorhinostomy (Option C): This is more suitable for distal nasolacrimal duct obstructions and is not the first choice for canalicular obstructions. Dacryocystectomy (Option D): This is a last-resort procedure used for chronic infections or tumors and is not indicated for a functional lacrimal system with a canalicular block.",

      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: C) Lacrimal Explanation: Dacryocystorhinostomy (DCR) is a surgical procedure performed to treat nasolacrimal duct obstruction, which causes epiphora due to impaired tear drainage. The surgery involves creating a new drainage pathway for tears from the lacrimal sac into the nasal cavity. Indications for DCR: Chronic dacryocystitis (infection of the lacrimal sac) Obstruction of the nasolacrimal duct (either congenital or acquired, e.g., from trauma or aging) Recurrent epiphora (despite conservative treatments) Types of DCR: External DCR (Traditional): Involves making an incision on the skin near the medial canthus of the eye . The lacrimal bone (Mostly) and a portion of the maxillary bone are removed to create an opening between the lacrimal sac and the nasal cavity. A stent is often placed to keep the passage open until healing is complete. Endoscopic DCR (Minimally invasive): No external incision is made. An endoscope is inserted through the nasal cavity to create a passage between the lacrimal sac and nasal cavity. This approach is preferred for cosmetic reasons and for patients who may have anatomical difficulties with external incisions. Postoperative Care: Antibiotics are prescribed to prevent infection. Stent removal (if placed) occurs after 6–8 weeks. Nasal saline irrigation may be recommended to keep the new drainage pathway clear. Complications: Infection Stenosis (narrowing) of the new drainage passage Persistent epiphora or failure of the procedure Reference: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK557851/",

      },
      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: A) Canal of petit Explanation: The Canal of Petit (also known as Spatia Zonularia ) is a sacculated canal that encircles the equator of the lens, formed by the zonular fibers (the zonule of Zinn) that anchor the lens to the ciliary body. This canal is located behind the suspensory ligament of the lens and contains aqueous humor in the interstices between the zonules. It is an important anatomical feature in the structure of the eye. Zonular Spaces (Spatia Zonularia): Zonular fibers, also known as the zonule of Zinn , anchor the lens to the ciliary body and the ciliary part of the retina . These fibers are separated by spaces filled with aqueous humor , referred to as zonular spaces . Anatomy: The zonules form a fibrous ring around the equator of the lens, connecting it to the ciliary body . The spaces between the zonules form a sacculated canal known as Hannover’s Canal or Petit’s Canal or Petit’s spaces (spatia zonularia), which encircles the lens' equator. Function: These spaces are involved in the structure and function of the ciliary zonule , providing mechanical support for the lens and contributing to accommodation. The canal can be inflated using a fine blowpipe inserted under the suspensory ligament. Canal of Hannover (Option B) : Another term related to zonular anatomy, but it refers to a slightly different structure and is often used interchangeably with the Canal of Petit in some contexts. However, in this case, the correct answer is Canal of Petit . Hyaloid Canal (Option C) : This is a different structure in the eye, located within the vitreous body, and is the remnant of the fetal hyaloid artery. It is not related to the zonules or lens attachment. Pars Plana (Option D) : A region of the retina, part of the ciliary body, involved in ocular surgeries (like vitrectomy) but not related to the canal structures surrounding the lens.",

        "D": "iii, ii, i"
      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: B) i, ii, iii Explanation: In the management of dry eye syndrome , different stains are used to assess the health of the ocular surface. The typical order of staining is as follows: Fluorescein Stain : First step : Fluorescein is typically used first to highlight epithelial defects and tear film stability . It is a bright yellow-green dye that fluoresces under cobalt blue light, marking areas of corneal epithelial damage. It can also help assess the tear break-up time (TBUT). Lissamine Green : Second step : Lissamine green is a vital dye that stains dead or degenerated cells in the conjunctiva and cornea, often used to evaluate the conjunctival surface in dry eyes. It is less irritating than Rose Bengal, making it ideal for dry eye patients, and it stains areas with poor tear film or disrupted epithelial integrity . Rose Bengal Stain : Third step : Rose Bengal stains damaged epithelial cells in the conjunctiva and cornea, particularly in cases of severe dryness . It can be more irritating to the eye than the other two stains, so it is typically used last in the staining sequence. It is helpful in identifying severe damage, such as conjunctival filaments or corneal ulcers . Investigations of dry eye 1, Slit-lamp examination Superficial corneal erosions Inadequate tear lake volume Early tear film break-up time Conjunctival hyperemia Conjunctival surface irregularities Meibomian gland dysfunction 2. Schirmer’s Test: Schirmer’s test is used to diagnose aqueous deficiency dry eye disease. Schirmer's Test 1 Measures both basal and reflex tear secretions Uses Whatman-4 filter paper, kept in the lower fornix at the junction of lateral one-third and medial two-thirds. After 5 minutes, wetting of the filter strip from the bent end is measured. Normal value: >15 mm 5-10 mm: Mild to moderate keratoconjunctivitis sicca (KCS). < 5 mm: Severe KCS [1] Schirmer's Test 2 Measures only basal secretion under anesthesia 3. Phenol Red Test A modified Schirmer’s test using a cotton thread impregnated with phenol red dye. The thread is placed in the lower fornix for 15 seconds. Phenol dye changes from yellow to red depending on the pH of the tears. Wet length: >20 mm: Normal. <10 mm: Severe dry eye. ≤ 19 mm as borderline dry eye. 4. Tear Film Break-Up Time (TBUT) Tear film stained with sodium fluorescein 1% is observed under a slit lamp, and time is noted after the patient blinks. The interval between the complete blink and the first appearance of a ‘dark’ dry spot on the cornea is recorded as TBUT. It is an indicator of the adequacy of the mucin component of tears. Normal: 15-35 seconds < 10 seconds indicates unstable tear film. 5. Rose Bengal or Lissamine Green Stain devitalized, desiccated corneal and conjunctival epithelium red or green. 6. Alcian Blue Stains particulate matter in the tear film due to mucus 7. Tear Osmolarity Increased in dry eye 8. Tear to Lysozyme ratio Between 0.9 and 0.6 indicates dry eye. Options A, C, & D are incorrect.",

      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer B - Dacryocystorhinostomy Chronic dacryocystitis is a condition characterized by inflammation and infection of the lacrimal sac, typically due to a blockage of the nasolacrimal duct. The patient’s symptoms of recurrent tearing, discharge, and mild swelling in the inner corner of the eye are classic signs of this condition. Dacryocystorhinostomy (DCR) is the definitive surgical procedure designed to create a new drainage pathway between the lacrimal sac and the nasal cavity, thus resolving the obstruction and restoring proper tear drainage. This approach addresses the underlying blockage and prevents recurrence. Aspect Acute Dacryocystitis Chronic Dacryocystitis Aetiology Acute exacerbation of chronic dacryocystitis Spread from neighbouring infected structures (e.g., sinuses, bones, dental abscess) Causative organisms: Streptococcus haemolyticus, Pneumococcus, Staphylococcus Stasis and mild infection of long duration Common in women aged 40-60 Causes: anatomical factors (narrow bony canal), nasal diseases, foreign bodies, infection. Clinical Features/ Sequelae Stage of cellulitis: Painful swelling at the lacrimal sac, epiphora, fever, redness, and oedema. Lacrimal abscess: Pus-filled sac, fluctuant swelling, may rupture forming an abscess. Fistula formation: Untreated abscess leads to spontaneous discharge, forming a fistula. Stage of chronic catarrhal dacryocystitis: Watering eye, mild redness, NLD block Lacrimal mucocele: Swelling below inner canthus, mucoid fluid regurgitation. Chronic suppurative dacryocystitis: Purulent discharge (d/t infection), recurrent conjunctivitis. Chronic fibrotic sac: Thickened mucosa, persistent epiphora, irregular folds. Image Complications Conjunctivitis, corneal ulcer, lid abscess, orbital cellulitis, facial cellulitis, rarely cavernous sinus thrombosis. Conjunctivitis, ectropion of lower lid, risk of corneal ulcers. Treatment Cellulitis: Systemic antibiotics, anti-inflammatory drugs, hot fomentation. Lacrimal abscess: Drainage with incision, antibiotics, possible DCT or DCR later. External fistula: Fistulectomy with DCT or DCR after controlling infection. Conservative: Probing and syringing (early stages). Dacryocystorhinostomy (DCR): Preferred surgery to re-establish lacrimal drainage. Dacryocystectomy (DCT): Indicated if DCR is contraindicated or in cases of fibrosis, infection, or old age. Lacrimal sac massage (Option A) : This is a conservative approach often recommended for mild or early cases of nasolacrimal duct obstruction, especially in infants. It helps express the accumulated tears and debris in the lacrimal sac. However, in chronic dacryocystitis in adults, this approach is typically insufficient and would not resolve the underlying obstruction. Syringing (Option C) (irrigation of the lacrimal system) can help clear the obstruction in some cases and is often used diagnostically to confirm the presence of a blockage. However, it does not provide a long-term solution and is typically not effective for treating chronic dacryocystitis in adults, particularly when there is significant structural obstruction. Probing (Option D) is a procedure used primarily in young children with congenital nasolacrimal duct obstruction. It is typically not appropriate for adults with chronic dacryocystitis, especially in cases where there is long-standing obstruction or",

The upper blade features a sharp cutting edge and a small hole, while the lower blade has a cup-shaped indentation. This tool is utilized in DCR (dacryocystorhinostomy) surgery to expand the bony opening by punching the bone from the edges of the opening. Types of DCR: External Dacryocystorhinostomy (External DCR) procedure is performed through an incision near the inner corner of the eye, providing direct access to the lacrimal sac and nasal mucosa. The lacrimal sac is accessed via the Bone punch used to expand the opening (Option D) . It is widely regarded as the gold standard due to its high success rate , which exceeds 90% . However, it leaves a visible scar and may result in greater blood loss compared to other methods. External DCR Endonasal Dacryocystorhinostomy (Endonasal DCR): involves using an endoscope inserted through the nasal cavity to create a drainage opening, thus avoiding any external incision. While it has the advantage of being scarless and typically involves less bleeding, its success rate is slightly lower, ranging between 70-90%. Endocanalicular Laser Dacryocystorhinostomy (Laser DCR): This method utilizes a laser passed through the tear duct to create a drainage opening. It is minimally invasive and can be performed quickly under local anaesthesia. However, its success rate is lower than external or endonasal DCR, around 70%, and patients often require additional surgery if the initial procedure fails.

      },
      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "innervated by the parasympathetic nervous system. The postsynaptic parasympathetic fibers that reach the lacrimal gland originate from the Pterygopalatine ganglion. The preganglionic parasympathetic fibers synapse in the Pterygopalatine ganglion, and the postganglionic fibers then travel to form zygomatic and zygomaticotemporal nerve and reach the lacrimal gland to stimulate tear production. Incorrect Options: Option A - Ciliary ganglion: The ciliary ganglion is associated with the innervation of pupil constrictor and ciliary muscle responsible for controlling the pupillary constriction and lens accommodation. Option B - Otic ganglion: The otic ganglion is involved in the innervation of the parotid salivary gland. Option C - Submandibular ganglion: The submandibular ganglion plays a role in the innervation of the submandibular and sublingual salivary glands.",

      "explanation": "an obstruction beyond the medial opening of the common canaliculus. This procedure involves connecting the lacrimal sac to the mucosa of the middle nasal meatus. To perform this procedure, a vertical incision is made in the skin, 10 mm medial to the inner canthus. Then, the medial canthal tendon and lacrimal sac are exposed and reflected. The intervening bone is removed, and the sac is incised. Finally, the sac is attached to an opening created in the nasal mucosa. Incorrect Options: Options A, C, and D are incorrect. Refer to Option B for an explanation.",
