      "correct_answer": "D",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: D) Cavernous sinus thrombosis Explanation: Abducens Nerve (cranial nerve VI) Type Motor Origin Pons (lower border, opposite the pyramid of the medulla). Course Functional component General somatic efferent fibres : Arise from the abducent nucleu s in the pons and supply the lateral rectus muscle of the eyeball. General somatic afferent fibres carry proprioceptive sensations from the lateral rectus and terminate in the mesencephalic nucleus of the trigeminal nerve. Supply Lateral rectus muscle of the eyeball Clinical aspect Cavernous sinus thrombosis leads to abducens nerve palsy Lesion or injury (elevated intracranial pressure) of the abducens nerve results in paralysis of the lateral rectus muscle, leading to: Inability to abduct the eye Diplopia (double vision) Convergent squint (due to the unopposed action of medial rectus) Incorrect Options: Retinoblastoma (Option A) is a type of eye cancer that primarily affects young children. It originates in the retina. It can occur unilaterally and also be bilateral. Orbital pseudotumor (Option B) , also known as idiopathic orbital inflammatory syndrome, is a condition characterized by inflammation and swelling of the tissues within the orbit. Orbital cellulitis (Option C) is an infection characterized by inflammation and infection of the soft tissues within the orbit. It is usually caused by the spread of an infection from the adjacent structures, such as the sinuses or eyelids.",

      "question": "Which structures are affected in a pregnant woman who exhibits fever, retroorbital pain, headache, pulsatile proptosis of the right eye, and tinnitus, while having normal blood pressure and fundus? 1. Abducens nerve 2. Oculomotor nerve 3. Internal carotid artery 4. Cavernous sinus",

        "D": "A, B, C, D"
      },
      "correct_answer": "D",
      "explanation": "proptosis, and tinnitus, suggest a possible case of cavernous sinus thrombosis. Abducens nerve : The abducens nerve (cranial nerve VI) runs through the cavernous sinus. It is responsible for controlling the lateral rectus muscle, which abducts the eye. Compression or dysfunction can cause pulsatile proptosis and eye movement abnormalities . Oculomotor nerve : The oculomotor nerve (cranial nerve III) also passes through the cavernous sinus and controls most of the eye's movements, including the muscles responsible for pupil constriction. Dysfunction here can lead to ptosis and pupil abnormalities . Internal carotid artery : The internal carotid artery runs through the cavernous sinus and can be affected in cases of sinus thrombosis or vascular pathology. Pulsatile proptosis and tinnitus are often signs of vascular involvement (e.g., arteriovenous fistula or carotid-cavernous fistula). Cavernous sinus : The cavernous sinus is a critical structure that houses several cranial nerves (III, IV, V1, V2, and VI) and the internal carotid artery. Thrombosis or infection here can lead to a constellation of symptoms involving nerve dysfunction and vascular compromise. Given the symptoms and the structures involved, the correct answer is Option D: A, B, C, D , since all these structures (abducens nerve, oculomotor nerve, internal carotid artery, and cavernous sinus) are likely affected in this scenario. Cavernous sinus Thrombosis: Typically results from infections such as sinusitis, orbital cellulitis, or otitis. Symptoms: Severe headache Malaise Nausea and vomiting Unilateral or bilateral proptosis Chemosis Congestion of facial, conjunctival, and retinal veins Reduced vision Cranial nerve dysfunction (third to sixth cranial nerves) Diagnosis: Imaging, especially MRI and MRI venography Systemic infection investigations, including lumbar puncture Treatment: Intravenous antibiotics Possible surgical drainage Prognosis: High mortality rate (20% with treatment, up to 100% untreated) Options A, B, & C are incorrect.

      "explanation": "nerve) : Controls most of the eye’s movements, including the medial rectus (for adduction of the eye). VI (Abducens nerve) : Controls the lateral rectus muscle, responsible for moving the eye laterally. VIII (Vestibulocochlear nerve) : Involved in the vestibular system, which helps detect head movement and contributes to the reflex response. Thus, the correct answer is Option D: A, C, and D . Oculocephalic Reflex (Doll's Eyes Reflex) Assesses the vestibular-ocular reflex (VOR) to evaluate cranial nerves 3, 6, and 8, brainstem function, and overall neurologic status. It is commonly used in neurologic critical care, for neonates, anesthetized patients, and those with dizziness. Procedure: The examiner holds the patient’s eyelids open and rotates their head from side to side. Positive reflex: Eyes move in the opposite direction of head rotation, indicating intact brainstem function. Negative reflex: Eyes stay midline, indicating possible severe brainstem dysfunction. A similar test can be performed for vertical eye movements. Clinical Significance: Vestibular Lesions: Lesions to the vestibular system can impair the reflex. Dizziness: Abnormal responses indicate possible vestibular dysfunction. Psychiatric Patients: Schizophrenia and bipolar patients show abnormal smooth pursuit eye movements but typically maintain an intact doll's eyes reflex. Intensive Care: The reflex can predict altered mental status (delirium, coma) after sedation cessation. Neonates: The reflex is active in neonates before 11.5 weeks and serves as a developmental milestone. Anesthesia & Ophthalmologic Surgery: The reflex is useful for assessing brainstem function in these contexts. Caution: Do not perform on patients with head or neck injuries that could worsen from the reflex technique.",

In its absence, the unopposed pull of the medial rectus causes the eye to deviate inward , resulting in esotropia (convergent squint). This condition is commonly seen in abducent nerve palsy. Paralytic squint : Paralytic squint is a type of incomitant squint in which ocular deviation results from complete or incomplete paralysis of one or more extraocular muscles. History of diplopia and confusion Secondary deviation is greater than primary deviation. Ocular movements are restricted towards the action of paralyzed muscle. Head is turned towards the action of paralyzed muscle. Incorrect Options: Oculomotor (Option A) lesion causes ptosis, mydriasis (pupil dilation), and difficulty moving the eye upward, downward, or inward. The eye often rests in a \"down and out\" position . Trochlear (Option B) nerve lesion affects the superior oblique muscle, leading to vertical diplopia and difficulty looking downward, particularly in adduction Trigeminal (Option C) nerve is responsible for facial sensation and mastication; it does not innervate any extraocular muscles.

In this test, a bright light is shone into the eye to bleach the photoreceptors, and the recovery time for visual acuity is measured. A prolonged recovery time indicates macular dysfunction, while optic nerve diseases typically do not affect the photostress recovery time. Cataract and glaucoma (Option B) These conditions affect different structures (cataract affects the lens, and glaucoma affects the optic nerve). The photostress test does not assess the lens or intraocular pressure-related damage. Lens and cornea (Option C) The photostress test is unrelated to refractive or structural abnormalities of the lens and cornea. Retina and vitreous pathologies (Option D) While the photostress test involves the retina, it is specific for evaluating macular function, not general retinal issues or vitreous pathologies (e.g., retinal detachment or vitreous hemorrhage).

      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "mild ptosis, and a persistent small pupil even in low light is suggestive of horner syndrome. Ptosis is a result of the weakness of Müller muscle and miosis due to the unopposed action of the sphincter pupillae with resultant anisocoria. Pancoast tumor can compress the sympathetic nerves, leading to the classic triad of symptoms seen in Horner syndrome: ptosis, miosis (constricted pupil), and ipsilateral facial anhidrosis (lack of sweating). Acquired Neurogenic Ptosis: Acquired ptosis with drooping of the upper eyelid caused by a disruption in the nerve supply to the muscles responsible for elevating the eyelid. Causes: Third Cranial (Oculomotor) Nerve Palsy: The third nerve can be damaged by trauma, ischemia, infection, tumor, or compression, causing ptosis and diplopia.Oculomotor nerve palsy causes ptosis as it supplies the levator palpebrae superioris muscle. The ptotic eyelid can be elevated with a frontalis sling or levator aponeurosis advancement. Horner's Syndrome: Involves a lesion in the sympathetic pathway , affecting the Müller’s muscle, leading to mild ptosis accompanied by miosis (pupil constriction) and anhidrosis (loss of sweating). Ophthalmoplegic migraine Multiple Sclerosis Diagnosis: Topical apraclonidine test is now considered the test of choice. Apraclonidine is an alpha-2 adrenergic agonist that also acts as a very weak alpha 1-adrenergic agonist; when topically applied in Horner’s syndrome, it causes dilation of the affected pupil and possibly lid elevation, without change to the normal pupil. Incorrect Options Adie’s tonic people (Option A) It is a unilateral condition and is characterized by anisocoria (different size of pupil) and direct light reflex is sluggish or absent. Marcus gunn pupil (Option C) Aka relative afferent pupillary defect is characterized by paradoxical dilatation of both the pupil when light is flashed on the diseased eye. Argyll Robertson pupil (Option D) It is a specific sign of late-stage syphilis. The bilaterally small pupils do not constrict when exposed to bright light.

      "explanation": "the region of the sella turcica, pressure by a suprasellar aneurysm, or chronic arachnoiditis; these press upon the chiasma, so that the fibers going to the nasal halves of each retina are destroyed. So a tumor in the anterior pituitary pressing on the optic chiasma will present as a case of Bitemporal hemianopia. Pituitary adenoma: The most common visual defect associated with Pituitary Adenoma is Bitemporal hemianopia, which results from the compression of Binasal fibres that cross at the Optic Chiasma. It is the most common Suprasellar mass in adults. Classification: Microadenomas : <10 mm; often incidental or present with endocrine symptoms. Macroadenomas : >10 mm; may cause visual field deficits due to mass effect. Common Types : Prolactinomas : 30% of cases present with amenorrhea and galactorrhea. Non-functioning Adenomas : 20%; no hormone secretion. Growth Hormone-Secreting Adenomas : 15%; causes acromegaly. ACTH-Secreting Adenomas : 10% leads to Cushing's disease. Clinical features: Visual Defect : Compression of the optic chiasm often causes bitemporal hemianopia . Endocrine Symptoms : Amenorrhea, galactorrhea, and other hormonal imbalances. Imaging and diagnosis involve MRI as the primary modality, along with serum prolactin and thyroid function tests and visual field charting. Treatment : Medical management Prolactinomas : Dopamine agonists (e.g., bromocriptine, cabergoline). Growth Hormone-Secreting Tumors : Somatostatin analogues (e.g., octreotide). Surgical management Transsphenoidal Approach : Preferred for most cases; craniotomy may be needed for large tumours. Sublabial Approach Indications : Acute visual deterioration, GH-secreting tumours, Cushing's disease, or large non-functioning adenomas causing symptoms. Complications : Pituitary Apoplexy : Sudden haemorrhage or infarction in the tumour, presenting with headache, visual loss, and ophthalmoplegia. Postoperative Risks : CSF leaks, pituitary insufficiency, and diabetes insipidus. Incorrect Options: Homonymous hemianopia (Option A) is caused by post chiasmal lesions like optic tract, optic radiations, and visual cortex lesions. Inferior quadrantanopia hemianopia (Option B) It is caused by a lesion of the fibers of the optic radiations in the anterior parietal lobe. Superior quadrantanopia hemianopia (Option D) It is caused by a lesion of the fibers of the optic radiations in the temporal lobe.",

      "explanation": "opposite side of the head injury) is the correct option. When there is elevated intracranial pressure, the brainstem can be compressed, leading to dysfunction of the parasympathetic fibers of cranial nerve III. This can result in a constricted pupil on the side opposite to the injury, known as the \"ipsilateral blown pupil\" or \"false localizing sign.\" This finding is a serious neurological sign indicating herniation and requires immediate medical attention. Incorrect Options: Option A. Ipsilateral Mydriasis: Ipsilateral mydriasis (dilated pupil on the same side as the head injury) suggests compression of the oculomotor nerve (cranial nerve III) due to herniation or direct injury. This is a sign of increased intracranial pressure and can be indicative of a serious brain injury. Option B. Contralateral Mydriasis: Contralateral mydriasis (dilated pupil on the opposite side of the head injury) is not a typical finding in cases of elevated intracranial pressure. Mydriasis usually occurs on the side of the injury or herniation due to compression of the oculomotor nerve. Option C. Ipsilateral Miosis: Ipsilateral miosis (constricted pupil on the same side as the head injury) is not a typical finding in cases of elevated intracranial pressure. Miosis can occur due to damage to sympathetic pathways (Horner's syndrome), but this is not related to increased ICP. Reference: .",

      "explanation": "one of its characteristic features is the relative afferent pupillary defect (RAPD) . RAPD is observed when a light is shone in the affected eye, and the pupil does not constrict as much as it should. This is due to the impaired function of the optic nerve in transmitting the light reflex to the brain. Classification of Optic neuritis Aspect Papillitis Retrobulbar Neuritis Neuroretinitis Site Optic disc Optic nerve behind the eyeball. Optic disc and surrounding retina in the macular area. Characteristic features Fundoscopy reveals a blurred disc margin due to leakage and increased capillary permeability, edematous and hyperaemic disc, and physiological cup is obliterated. Pain on eye elevation RAPD (relative afferent pupillary defect) is observed. Fundoscopic examination typically reveals normal optic disc , at least initially, which is why the classic phrase, “ the patient sees nothing, and the doctor sees nothing ” is often used to describe retrobulbar neuritis. A macular star is seen in fundoscopy (accumulation of lipids). Clinical features, It may be asymptomatic or associated with, Visual loss: Monocular sudden, progressive and profound visual loss is the hallmark of acute optic neuritis. Dark adaptation may be lowered. Visual obscuration in bright light is a typical symptom of acute optic neuritis. Impairment of color vision is always present in optic neuritis. Uhthoff's symptom: Episodic transient obscuration of vision on exertion and on exposure to heat, which recovers on resting or moving away from the heat, occurs in patients with isolated optic neuritis. Pulfrich's phenomenon: Depth perception may be impaired, particularly for the moving object. Visual acuity is usually reduced markedly. Visual field changes: The most common field defect in optic neuritis is a relative central or centrocecal scotoma. Contrast sensitivity is impaired. There is no pain on ocular movement (Option B) : Pain on ocular movement is one of the hallmark symptoms of optic neuritis . It often precedes or accompanies vision loss, making it a distinguishing feature of the condition. Multiple myeloma is a common cause (Option C) : Multiple myeloma is a rare cause of optic neuritis. Most cases of optic neuritis are idiopathic or related to multiple sclerosis (MS) . Other systemic conditions like infectious or autoimmune diseases may also be involved, but multiple myeloma is not typically associated with optic neuritis. Oral corticosteroids are the mainstay of treatment (Option D) : Oral corticosteroids are not the first-line treatment for optic neuritis. Intravenous corticosteroids (IV methylprednisolone) are more commonly used in acute optic neuritis, particularly to speed up recovery and reduce the risk of recurrence in conditions like multiple sclerosis",

      },
      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: C) Iris details are visible Explanation: Macular opacity refers to an opacity in the lens or cornea that affects the passage of light and vision. The extent to which the iris and pupil are visible depends on the density and location of the opacity. In macular opacity, the central part of the lens is affected, which significantly impairs central vision and causes a \"shadowing\" effect in the visual axis. As a result, only the pupillary margin is visible, while details of the iris may be obscured due to the opacity. Iris and pupil are visible (Option A) : If both the iris and pupil were completely visible, it would suggest the absence of significant central opacity, which contradicts the question. Iris details are visible (Option C): If iris details were visible, it would imply minimal or no opacity, which is incorrect for macular opacity. Iris and pupillary margin are not visible (Option B): This would be true for total opacity (e.g., mature cataract or dense corneal opacity), but macular opacity allows limited peripheral visualization.

      "explanation": "condition where there is an abnormal connection between the trigeminal nerve (supplying Lateral pterygoid) and the oculomotor nerve (supplying LPS). This results in the upper eyelid (ptosis) lifting when the jaw moves, such as during chewing, sucking, or other movements involving the jaw. The eye movement (or \"winking\") is typically unilateral and can occur during activities like breastfeeding or thumb-sucking, as in this case. This reflex is not present when the baby is not feeding, which is a key feature of this condition. Congenital Ptosis: Associated with congenital weakness or maldevelopment of the levator palpebrae superioris (LPS) muscle. Congenital ptosis probably results from a failure of neuronal migration or development with muscular sequelae secondary to this. A minority of patients have a family history. Characteristic features: Drooping of one or both upper lids. Lid crease is either diminished or absent. Lid lag on downgaze due to tethering effect of abnormal LPS muscle. Types of congenital ptosis: 1. Simple congenital ptosis: Unilateral or bilateral Non-progressive No fluctuation: Unlike myogenic ptosis, congenital ptosis does not worsen throughout the day or improve with rest. 2. Congenital ptosis with associated weakness of superior rectus muscle. 3. Blepharophimosis syndrome: Congenital ptosis Blepharophimosis Telecanthus Epicanthus inversus. 4. Congenital synkinetic ptosis (Marcus Gunn jaw-winking ptosis) Retraction of the ptotic lid with jaw movements due to stimulation of ipsilateral pterygoid muscle. It occurs due to trigemino-oculomotor synkinesis. The pathophysiology of Marcus Gunn Jaw winking phenomenon is a congenital misdirection of mandibular branch of trigeminal nerve, i.e., this synkinetic movement results from a congenital aberrant connection between motor branches of the trigeminal nerve controlling muscles of mastication and superior division of the oculomotor nerve controlling the levator palpebrae superioris. Lagophthalmos (Option B): This condition is characterized by an inability to completely close the eyelids, usually due to facial nerve (VII) dysfunction or other causes of eyelid weakness. Myasthenia Gravis (Option C) : Myasthenia gravis typically presents with fatigable weakness of the muscles, including the eyelids (ptosis), which worsens with activity. 3rd CN Palsy (Option D) : A third cranial nerve palsy typically causes ptosis (drooping of the eyelid) and ocular motility issues (like strabismus or limited eye movement).",

Males and females are equally affected. Aetiology Idiopathic: Most common cause Viral Infection: HSV >> Herpes zoster Vascular Ischemia Hereditary: Positive family history in 6-8% Autoimmune Risk Factors More common in diabetics (due to angiopathy) and pregnant women (due to fluid retention). Clinical Features Sudden onset of facial paralysis with inability to close the eye (Bell's phenomenon) (Option A) , asymmetry of the face, epiphora, drooping mouth, and dribbling of saliva. Associated symptoms may include ear pain, noise intolerance (stapedial paralysis), or loss of taste (chorda tympani involvement). Diagnosis Diagnosis is made by excluding other causes of peripheral facial paralysis. Treatment General: Reassurance, pain relief, eye protection and physiotherapy Medical: Prednisolone 60 mg per day for 5 days then reduced by 10 mg per day (for a total treatment time of 10 days) and 50 mg per day (in two divided doses) for 10 days, Acyclovir Surgical: Nerve decompression Prognosis 85%-90% of patients fully recover Incomplete resolution are mainly seen in recurrent/late recovery cases Incorrect Options: 6th nerve (Option B) leads to lateral rectus muscle paralysis, causing impaired abduction. 4th nerve (Option C) affects the superior oblique muscle, resulting in vertical diplopia. 5th nerve (Option D) is responsible for facial sensation and corneal reflex, but not eyelid closure.

The nasociliary nerve is typically targeted for blockage in procedures involving the ophthalmic region, especially in the context of blocking sensations to the eye and adjacent structures. The nasociliary nerve , as a branch of the ophthalmic division of the trigeminal nerve (V1), plays a central role in sensory innervation to the eye, cornea, and adjacent regions, which is why it is the primary target in many ophthalmic nerve blocks. Nasociliary nerve block The nasociliary nerve is a branch of the ophthalmic division (V1) of the trigeminal nerve (CN V) . It provides sensory innervation to structures such as the cornea , conjunctiva , sclera , ciliary body , and parts of the nose . Indications for Block: Ocular surgery (e.g., cataract surgery, corneal procedures). Pain management in conditions like corneal ulcers , ocular trauma , or sinusitis . Techniques: Injection Site : The needle is typically inserted near the medial canthus of the eye, in the area where the nasociliary nerve is located close to the lacrimal sac . Injection Approach : The needle is advanced medially, just lateral to the nasal bone , and injected near the nerve's location. Anatomy : The nasociliary nerve travels within the orbit , giving off branches like the long ciliary nerves , posterior ethmoidal , and anterior ethmoidal nerves . Procedure: Patient Positioning : The patient is usually seated or supine with the eye to be blocked exposed. Needle Insertion : A 25-30 gauge needle is used, inserted near the medial canthus , directed medially and slightly superiorly. Local Anesthetic : A small",

      "question": "A 40-year-old male patient presents with altered sensation in the extremities, difficulty with coordination, and speech problems. On examination, it is noted that the pupillary light reaction is absent, but the accommodation reaction is present. Which condition is most likely responsible for this presentation?",

        "A": "Neurosyphilis",
        "B": "Horner's syndrome",
        "C": "Papilledema",
        "D": "Optic Neuritis"
      },
      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: A) Neurosyphilis Explanation: Neurosyphilis is a complication of syphilis that affects the nervous system. It occurs in the tertiary stage of syphilis, typically years after the initial infection. The condition can present with a variety of neurological symptoms, including altered sensation, coordination difficulties, and speech problems, as seen in the patient. Specific features of this case, including absent pupillary light reaction with intact accommodation, are highly suggestive of Argyll Robertson pupils , which is a classic sign of neurosyphilis . Neurosyphilis and Argyll Robertson Pupils: Pupillary Light Reflex Absent : The pupillary light reflex is mediated by the optic nerve (CN II) and oculomotor nerve (CN III). In neurosyphilis, the optic nerve is often involved, leading to loss of the pupillary light reflex. Accommodation Reflex Present : Despite the absence of the light reflex, the accommodation reflex (the ability of the pupil to constrict when focusing on a near object) remains intact, which is typical in Argyll Robertson pupils . This occurs because the pathways responsible for accommodation (afferent via the optic nerve and efferent via the oculomotor nerve) are not usually affected in neurosyphilis. Other Symptoms: The patient may also present with neurological symptoms such as sensory disturbances, motor coordination problems (ataxia), and speech difficulties, all of which can be part of neurosyphilis. Spirochetal uveitis: Organism: Treponema pallidum Anterior uveitis: It can present as granulomatous or non-granulomatous iritis typically in the secondary syphilis stage Iris roseola - dilated iris vessels that develop into nodules ‘Plastic’ iritis occurs in congenital syphilis and Jarisch–Herxheimer reaction Posterior uveitis: It occurs as disseminated, peripheral, or diffuse choroiditis. Treatment: Systemic penicillin Horner's Syndrome (Option B) : This condition is caused by disruption of the sympathetic pathway to the eye and presents with ptosis, miosis, and anhidrosis. It does not cause absent pupillary light reflex or preserved accommodation reflex. Papilledema (Option C) : Papilledema is swelling of the optic disc due to increased intracranial pressure, which can affect vision but would not explain the absence of the light reflex with preserved accommodation. It also doesn't account for the coordination and speech problems. Optic Neuritis (Option D) : Optic neuritis involves inflammation of the optic nerve, which can cause vision changes, but it does not typically cause the combination of absent light reflex with intact accommodation. Also, optic neuritis usually doesn't present with the full range of neurological symptoms seen here.",

      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer B - RSO and LIR The Right Superior Oblique (RSO) and the Left Inferior Rectus (LIR) are the yoke muscles involved in levodepression (the downward movement of both eyes when the gaze is directed to the left). Right Superior Oblique (RSO) : The superior oblique muscle in the right eye helps depress the eye when it is abducted (pushed outward). Left Inferior Rectus (LIR) : The inferior rectus muscle in the left eye helps depress the eye. These two muscles coordinate to cause the downward movement of the eyes when looking to the left. Yoke muscles Yoke muscles are pairs of extraocular muscles, one in each eye, that work together to ensure coordinated eye movements in the same direction. These muscles function according to Hering's Law of Equal Innervation , which ensures that corresponding muscles in both eyes receive equal neural impulses for synchronised movement. Hering’s Law of Equal Innervation would mean that the right lateral rectus (yoke muscle) should be balanced with the left medial rectus ( vs Sherrington’s law: This law about reciprocal innervation states that increased innervation and contraction of a muscle is automatically associated with reciprocal decrease in innervation and contraction of its antagonist). The yoke muscle pairs facilitate various eye movements: Horizontal Gaze (Left or Right) : Leftward Gaze (Levoversion) : Left Lateral Rectus (abducts the left eye) Right Medial Rectus (adducts the right eye) Rightward Gaze (Dextroversion) : Right Lateral Rectus (abducts the right eye) Left Medial Rectus (adducts the left eye) Vertical Gaze (Up or Down) : Upward Gaze (Elevation) : Right and Left Superior Rectus (elevate the eyes) Right and Left Inferior Oblique (assist in elevation) Downward Gaze (Depression) : Right and Left Inferior Rectus (depress the eyes) Right and Left Superior Oblique (assist in depression) Inward Gaze (Convergence) : Both Medial Rectus muscles contract to bring the eyes inward (toward the nose) during near-vision tasks, such as reading. LSO and RIR (Option A) : Incorrect because LSO (Left Superior Oblique) helps in depression but not for levodepression. RIR (Right Inferior Rectus) is also involved in depression but doesn't pair with LSO for this movement. RIO and LIR (Option C) : RIO (Right Inferior Oblique) assists with elevation, not depression. LIR does help in depression, but they don't work together for levodepression. LIO and RIR (Option D) : LIO (Left Inferior Oblique) assists with elevation, not depression. RIR does help in depression, but this pair is not correct for levodepression.",

      "question": "A 40-year-old male patient presents with altered sensation in the extremities, difficulty with coordination, and speech problems. On examination, it is noted that the pupillary light reaction is absent, but the accommodation reaction is present. Which condition is most likely responsible for this presentation?",
      "options": {
        "A": "Neurosyphilis",
        "B": "Horner’s syndrome",
        "C": "Papilledema",
        "D": "Optic Neuritis"
      },
      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "occurs in people who have had untreated syphilis for many years. One of the signs of neurosyphilis can be Argyll Robertson pupil, where the pupils do not react to light (absent pupillary light reaction) but do react to accommodation (preserved accommodation reaction). Incorrect Options: Option B - Horner’s syndrome: It is charcaterized by miosis, ptosis, and decreased sweating anhidrosis on the affected side of your face. Option C - Papilledema: This is a condition in which increased pressure in or around the brain causes the part of the optic nerve inside the eye to swell. It can cause visual disturbances but doesn't typically result in an absent pupillary light reaction with preserved accommodation reaction. Option D - Optic Neuritis: It presents with Marcus gunn pupil, i.e., paradoxical s=dilatation of both the pupil when light is flashed to the disease eye.",

      "question": "A 45-year-old male arrived at the emergency ward with sudden vision loss and experiencing painful eye movements . Upon examination, the affected eye shows a relative afferent pupillary defect, a normal optic disc , and a central scotoma . What is the likely diagnosis?",
      "options": {
        "A": "Optic nerve glioma",
        "B": "Optic neuritis",
        "C": "Eale’s disease",
        "D": "Optic atrophy"
      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "pupillary defects, and central scotoma are characteristic of optic neuritis. It typically presents with marked sudden vision loss, dark adaptation may be lowered, and decreased contrast sensitivity. On examination RAPD (relative afferent pupillary defect), central scotoma, and centrocecal scotoma can be seen. Incorrect Options: Option A - Optic nerve glioma: Optic nerve glioma is a type of brain tumor that can affect the optic nerve, but it is relatively rare in adults and typically presents with symptoms of optic nerve with proptosis. Option C - Eale’s disease: Eale's disease is a condition that causes inflammation and occlusion of the retinal blood vessels, leading to vision loss and floaters. Option D - Optic atrophy: It is characterized by atrophy of the all damaged nerve fibers with total afferent pupillary defect and loss of perception of light. Reference: Prepladder Notes",
