Although SLE is an autoimmune disease that can affect multiple organs, iritis is less commonly seen in SLE compared to the other conditions listed. It more often causes other ocular manifestations, like dry eyes or retinal changes .

      "explanation": "history of trauma, along with the finding of white blood cells in the anterior chamber , the most likely diagnosis is hypopyon , which often results from infection or severe inflammation following eye trauma. Fungal keratitis is a common cause of corneal ulcers following eye trauma, especially when the injury is caused by vegetative matter (such as plant material or dirt). This type of trauma provides an entry point for fungal spores . The classic signs and symptoms of fungal keratitis include: Corneal ulcer with satellite lesions (smaller ulcers surrounding the main ulcer). Hypopyon (accumulation of white blood cells in the anterior chamber of the eye). Mild pain , photophobia , and redness . The history of vegetative matter as the cause of trauma is a significant clue, as fungi are commonly found in plant material. Keratomycosis Clinical Features Pain & Foreign Body Sensation Watering of the eye Photophobia Blurred Vision Redness. Examination Findings Corneal Ulcer : Greyish-white, dry-looking with elevated, rolled-out margins. Pigmented Ulcer : Brownish appearance, possible with dematiaceous fungi. Feathery Extensions : Delicate, finger-like projections into the surrounding stroma. Sterile Immune Ring : Yellow line of demarcation where fungal antigen and host antibodies meet. Satellite Lesions : Multiple small lesions around the main ulcer. Hypopyon : Large, non-sterile, even with a small ulcer. Endothelial Plaque : Located under the stromal lesion, made of fibrin and leucocytes. Corneal Vascularization : Typically absent in pure fungal ulcers. Perforation : Rare but possible. Investigations Corneal Scraping : Performed under topical anaesthesia for microbiological examination. Wet KOH Mount : Reveals filamentous fungi (branched, septate hyphae) or non-filamentous",

Psoriatic arthritis (Statement 4 ruled out): A seronegative spondyloarthropathy frequently associated with anterior uveitis including iritis, urethritis and arthritis. Ulcerative colitis (Statement 5 ruled out): Iritis is common in inflammatory bowel disease, as it shares a systemic inflammatory pathway. Rheumatoid arthritis: Iritis is rarely seen in adult-onset rheumatoid arthritis. However, it is more commonly associated with juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA), especially in ANA-positive cases.

T-cell mediated autoimmune hypersensitivity reaction to Retinal S antigen. Maximum risk upon injury to the ciliary body. Histopathology Diffuse lymphocytic infiltration of the choroid. Scattered aggregates of epithelioid cells are seen, many of which contain fine granules of melanin. Dalen–Fuchs nodules - granulomas located between Bruch membrane and the RPE (also seen in VKH syndrome) Clinical features The exciting eye is frequently red and irritable. The sympathizing eye develops irritation, blurred vision, photophobia and loss of accommodation causing difficulty in near vision (first symptom) Anterior uveitis develops in both eyes, which may be mild or severe and is usually granulomatous Investigations Fundus exam: Dalen–Fuchs nodules, Exudative retinal detachment, vasculitis and optic disc swelling. As inflammation settles, residual chorioretinal scarring may confer a ‘sunset glow’ appearance similar to VKH. B-scan ultrasonography : Choroidal thickening and retinal detachment Treatment Enucleation of a severely injured eye within 10 to 14 days of the injury is effective in preventing or reducing the severity of SO Steroids are the basis of initial treatment.

Cycloplegics (Topical): Rest the ciliary muscles to relieve pain. Prevent and break posterior synechiae (adhesions of the iris to the lens). Improve blood supply, leading to better healing. Eg.: Atropine . Non-Steroidal Treatment : Voclosporin: Part of the Luminate program, used as a non-steroidal option. For Chronic or Vision-Threatening Uveitis : Monoclonal Antibodies : Adalimumab : TNF-alpha inhibitor, used for severe or chronic cases. Infliximab : TNF-alpha inhibitor. Interferon Alpha : An option for severe cases, helps modulate the immune response. Incorrect Options: Moxifloxacin (Option A) is an antibiotic commonly used to treat bacterial infections. Acetazolamide (Option C) is a medication primarily used to treat glaucoma by reducing the production of aqueous humor and lowering intraocular pressure.
