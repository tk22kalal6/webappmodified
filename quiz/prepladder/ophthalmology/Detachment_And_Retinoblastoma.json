      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "followed by a second somatic mutation. Correct Answer: B) Retinoblastoma typically arises from a germline mutation in the RB1 gene, followed by a second somatic mutation. Explanation: Retinoblastoma is typically caused by a germline mutation in the RB1 gene (inherited or de novo) followed by a second somatic mutation or \"second hit\" in the retina, leading to the development of the tumor. Retinoblastoma is caused by inactivation of both alleles of the RB1 tumor suppressor gene . There are two forms: Heritable (germline) : Seen in about 40% of cases, this form often results in bilateral retinoblastoma. It involves a germline mutation of the RB1 gene in all cells, followed by a somatic mutation in the retinal cells. They are prone to develop non-ocular tumors like osteosarcoma. Non-heritable (sporadic) : This form usually involves a unilateral tumor and arises from two somatic mutations that occur in the retinal cells after embryo formation, without a germline mutation. Cannot be passed to offspring and is not prone for developing non-ocular tumors. Knudson’s Two-Hit Hypothesis: This hypothesis explains the development of retinoblastoma . According to this model: In heritable retinoblastoma, the child inherits a germline mutation in one allele of the RB1 gene (the first hit). A subsequent somatic mutation in the other allele in the retinal cells (the second hit) leads to tumor formation. In sporadic cases, both alleles of the RB1 gene are inactivated by somatic mutations (both hits occurring postnatally). Retinoblastoma can be inherited in an autosomal dominant manner, with affected individuals having a 100% chance of passing on the mutation (Option A): While retinoblastoma is",

      "question": "A 55-year-old woman with a history of proliferative diabetic retinopathy presents with sudden vision changes in her right eye. She reports seeing floaters and flashes of light. On fundoscopy, there is evidence of fibrous tissue contraction and retinal elevation, but no retinal breaks are seen. What is the most appropriate treatment approach for this patient?",

        "C": "Pars plana vitrectomy",
        "D": "Pneumatic retinopexy"
      },
      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: C) Pars plana vitrectomy Explanation: The patient’s symptoms and fundoscopy findings, including fibrous tissue contraction and retinal elevation without retinal breaks, are consistent with tractional retinal detachment . In this condition, the primary treatment approach is pars plana vitrectomy , which removes the vitreous and addresses the traction caused by the fibrous tissue, thereby relieving the retinal detachment. Clinical features: Presence of vitreoretinal bands associated with the underlying disease. Absence of retinal breaks. A concave, localized detachment that usually does not extend to the ora serrata. Maximum retinal elevation at sites of vitreoretinal traction. Severely reduced retinal mobility with no shifting fluid. Focal traction from cellular membranes can occasionally cause retinal tears, leading to a combined tractional-rhegmatogenous detachment. Treatment for tractional retinal detachment: Pars plana vitrectomy (PPV) is the standard approach for tractional retinal detachment. It involves removing cutting the vitreoretinal tractional bands and internal tamponade with either a long-acting gas or silicon oil. Treatment for exudative retinal detachment: Treatment focuses on managing the primary disease responsible for the exudative retinal detachment. Since exudative retinal detachment can be caused by transudate, exudate, or hemorrhage, fluid absorption results in the detachment resolving on its own. If the detachment is due to intraocular tumors, enucleation may be necessary. Laser photocoagulation (Option A) is used in proliferative retinopathies to prevent further neovascularization but does not address existing tractional detachment. Cryotherapy with scleral buckling (Option B) is effective in rhegmatogenous retinal detachment, not for tractional detachment. Pneumatic retinopexy (Option D) is not suitable for tractional or exudative detachments, as it primarily addresses rhegmatogenous detachment with retinal breaks.",

        "D": "Drainage of subretinal fluid with diathermy to seal the break"
      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "detachment with a small break in the upper quadrant. Pneumatic retinopexy is an appropriate choice for treating retinal detachments with small breaks in the superior retina. Treatment of Rhegmatogenous Retinal Detachment: The primary goals of treating rhegmatogenous retinal detachment are sealing retinal breaks, reducing vitreous traction, and flattening the retina by draining subretinal fluid (SRF) and providing external or internal tamponade. Sealing Retinal Breaks: All retinal breaks must be identified and sealed by inducing aseptic chorioretinitis. Techniques include cryocoagulation (for scleral buckling and pneumoretinopexy) or endo-laser photocoagulation (during vitrectomy). Drainage of Subretinal Fluid (SRF): SRF is carefully drained by inserting a fine needle through the sclera and choroid to allow fluid to escape, promoting retinal reattachment. In some cases, SRF drainage may not be necessary. Maintaining Chorioretinal Apposition: Scleral buckling: A surgical technique where material sutured onto the sclera (explant) creates an inward indentation (buckle). It is commonly used in simple cases by inserting a silicone band or sponge. Scleral buckling is an external retinal detachment surgery, which involves suturing an explant (material) onto the sclera to create an inward indentation (buckle). The buckle serves to close retinal breaks by pressing the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) against the sensory retina and reduces vitreoretinal traction. Urgent surgery is necessary for acute retinal detachment if the macula is not involved. Ideal for retinal detachment secondary to post-traumatic dialysis. Pneumatic retinopexy: (Option B) A minimally invasive quick and OP based procedure to reattach the retina. Uses an intravitreal gas bubble with cryotherapy or laser to seal retinal breaks. No scleral buckling is needed. Common gases: Sulfur hexafluoride (SF6) and perfluoropropane (C3F8). Used for uncomplicated retinal detachments. Ideal for small breaks or multiple breaks covering less than two clock hours in the upper peripheral retina. Vitrectomy and Internal Tamponade: Pars plana vitrectomy is performed for complicated or recurrent cases of RD and tractional detachments. This involves removing the vitreous, draining SRF, and flattening the retina using silicone oil or perfluorocarbon liquids. Endolaser photocoagulation is applied around breaks and retinotomy sites to create chorioretinal adhesions, followed by internal tamponade with gas (SF6 or C3F8) or silicone oil. Intravitreal",

      "explanation": "separation of the neurosensory retina from the retinal pigment epithelium. Etiology: Age: most common in 40-60 years. Sex. More common in males (M:F - 3:2). Myopia. About 40% cases of rhegmatogenous retinal detachment are myopic. Aphakia and pseudophakia. Trauma. It may also act as a predisposing factor. Senile posterior vitreous detachment (PVD): It is associated with retinal detachment in many cases. Retinal degenerations predisposed to retinal detachment: Lattice degeneration, Snail track degeneration, Acquired or degenerative retinoschisis, and Focal pigment clumps. Retinal detachment can be classified into three types: Rhegmatogenous or primary retinal detachment Tractional retinal detachment Exudative retinal detachment Rhegmatogenous Retinal Detachment : This is the most common type and occurs due to a retinal tear or break, allowing subretinal fluid to enter and separate the sensory retina from the pigmentary epithelium. Tractional Retinal Detachment : Results from the pulling of the retina by fibrous or vascular tissue, commonly seen in fibrovascular proliferative conditions like diabetic retinopathy, without a retinal break. Exudative Retinal Detachment : Caused due to choroidal pathologies or by tumors pushing the retina or fluid accumulation under the retina due to inflammation or vascular abnormalities, without any associated retinal tear or traction. Type of Retinal Detachment Clinical Features Rhegmatogenous Retinal Detachment Floaters (dark spots) due to rapid vitreous degeneration. Photopsia (flashes of light) caused by retinal irritation from vitreous movements. Gradual visual field loss, initially localized, progressing to total vision loss as detachment spreads. Dark veil/cloud in front of the eye , particularly when detachment reaches the posterior region. Sudden, painless vision loss in large, central detachment. Retinal breaks may be round, horseshoe-shaped, slit-like, or large anterior dialysis. Vitreous pigments (tobacco dusting or Shaffer sign ) are seen in the anterior vitreous with posterior vitreous detachment. Old retinal detachment shows retinal thinning, subretinal demarcation lines (high water marks), and secondary intraretinal cysts. Tractional Retinal Detachment Gradual, progressive visual loss Typically painless No associated flashes or floaters Vitreoretinal bands present No retinal breaks Detached area - concave and localized No shifting fluid Exudative Retinal Detachment Painless and sudden or gradual visual loss No photopsia, holes/ tears, folds and undulations.

Inherited in an autosomal dominant (AD) pattern. Usually begins in childhood Clinical Features : Stages of the disease include: Pre-vitelliform : abnormal EOG, normal fundus in asymptomatic patients. Vitelliform : a characteristic \"egg yolk or sunny-side up\" macular lesion. The lesions can vary in size and developmental stage between the two eyes. Pseudohypopyon: partially regressed lesion. Vitelliruptive : Lesion fragments, visual acuity declines - “scrambled egg appearance”. Atrophic : Pigment disappears, leading to RPE atrophy. Visual acuity - stable early on but declines in adulthood due to complications like choroidal neovascularization (CNV) , scarring, or geographic atrophy. Diagnosis : Fundus Autofluorescence (FAF) : hyper autofluorescence yellowish material. Fluorescein Angiography (FA) : hypofluorescence due to lesion masking. Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT) : hyperreflective material beneath and within the RPE. Electro-oculography (EOG) : Severely subnormal across all stages (Arden index <1.5).

The Triad of retinitis pigmentosa includes a pale waxy disc due to consecutive optic atrophy, attenuation of arteries, and pigmentation disturbance in the form of bony spicules. Retinitis pigmentosa is a dystrophy of rods and cones, initially, rods are affected. Most common hereditary fundus dystrophy. It can be sporadic (40-50%) or hereditary. If hereditary, autosomal dominant is the most common mode of inheritance followed by autosomal recessive (AR). X-linked recessive inheritance is the least severe form. Clinical features: Symptoms: Nyctalopia (night blindness) Peripheral visual field loss Mid-peripheral superior scotoma leads to ring/ doughnut scotoma resulting in tubular/ tunnel vision Signs: Triad of a p ale waxy disc due to consecutive optic atrophy, attenuation of arteries , and pigmentation",

      "correct_answer": "D",
      "explanation": "decade Correct Answer: D) AMD is the most common cause of permanent central visual loss after 6th decade Explanation: Age-related Macular Degeneration (AMD) is a nonhereditary degeneration involving the choriocapillaris, Bruch's membrane, retinal pigment epithelium, and photoreceptors. It is indeed the most common cause of permanent central visual loss after 6th decade. Based on the clinical findings of macular degeneration, It is of 2 types : Exudative (wet) Non-exudative (dry) Category Dry AMD Wet AMD Definition Nonexudative macular degeneration Exudative macular degeneration Prevalence 90% of all AMD cases 10% of all AMD cases Vision Loss Accounts for about 10% of legal blindness in AMD Major blinding form, accounts for 90% of severe vision loss in AMD Key Features Drusen, RPE abnormalities, geographic atrophy Choroidal neovascularization (CNV), subretinal fluid Pathophysiology Accumulation of drusen, dysfunction of RPE Growth of new blood vessels from choroid, leakage of fluid Progression Generally slow Can be rapid DRY AMD: (Option A) AMD is a nonhereditary degeneration primarily affecting the macula involving the choriocapillaris, Bruch's membrane, retinal pigment epithelium, and photoreceptors. (Option B) Wet AMD accounts for only 10% of all AMD cases but is responsible for 90% of severe vision loss in AMD patients. (Option C) Choroidal neovascularization is a characteristic of wet AMD, not dry AMD. Dry AMD is characterized by drusen, RPE abnormalities, and geographic atrophy.",
