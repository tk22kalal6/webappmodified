      "question": "A patient with rheumatoid arthritis who is noncompliant with treatment presents with complaints of superior field loss of vision for the past week. What is the most likely cause of this condition? occlusion D) Central retinal vein occlusion",

        "A": "Branched retinal artery occlusion B) Central retinal artery occlusion C) Branched retinal vein",

      },
      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "crossing. It is mostly seen in the superotemporal retinal as AV crossings are more in this area, so the chances of blockage are higher. In this case, the patient is presenting with superior field loss of vision due to blockage in the inferior branch retinal vein. Branch Retinal Vein Occlusion (BRVO) BRVO occurs when a single branch of the central retinal vein is occluded, causing retinal edema and hemorrhages localized to the area supplied by the blocked vein. Visual Defects: Visual loss is partial, superior or inferior field loss, depending on the location of the occlusion. Prognosis for central vision is better unless the macula is involved, often seen in superior temporal vein occlusion. Complications: Neovascularization and secondary glaucoma are rare but can occur in cases of widespread capillary occlusion. Diagnostic Features: Fluorescein Angiography: Shows areas of hypofluorescence, incomplete perifoveal arcades, and capillary closure in poorly perfused areas. Widespread capillary occlusion is associated with cotton-wool spots, delayed arteriovenous transit time, vessel leakage, and retinal edema. Treatment: No definitive treatment is effective once complete venous blockage occurs. Panphotocoagulation or Cryotherapy: Used to prevent complications like neovascular glaucoma and rubeosis iridis in cases of widespread capillary occlusion. Photocoagulation: Should only be performed after intraretinal blood absorption to address areas of poor perfusion, reducing edema and neovascularization risk. Anti-VEGF Therapy: Intravitreal injections are now standard for improving visual recovery and preventing late complications. Branched retinal artery occlusion (Option A) a cherry red spot in the retina is noticed due to the surrounding edema. Central retinal artery occlusion (Option B) obstruction occurs at the level of the lamina cribrosa, causing sudden painless loss of vision within seconds. Central retinal vein occlusion (Option D) there is a mild blurring of vision, which improves over the day. Reference: Parsons Diseases of the Eye 23rd edition Pg.no:773,776",

        "D": "Dermoid cyst"
      },
      "correct_answer": "D",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: D) Dermoid cyst Explanation: Dermoid cyst appears as a lenticular yellow tumor near the corneal margin and consists of epidermoid epithelium with sebaceous glands and hair. Dermoid cyst is a congenital , often benign growth that contains skin-like structures , such as hair follicles, sweat glands, and sebaceous glands. It can present as a small, firm, yellowish nodule on the sclera or conjunctiva . These cysts are often located near the limbus (the junction between the cornea and sclera) and may be noticed in childhood, especially if they grow or become more noticeable over time. A dermoid cyst may be diagnosed based on its characteristic appearance and location, and sometimes imaging or excision is needed for confirmation. Pterygium (Option A) : A pterygium is a fibrovascular growth that extends from the conjunctiva onto the cornea, typically seen on the nasal side of the eye. It is usually triangular in shape and may cause visual disturbance. It is not typically a nodule confined to the sclera. Pinguecula (Option B): A yellowish, triangular patch on the conjunctiva near the limbus, typically in the elderly, associated with sun exposure and not extending onto the cornea. Dermolipoma (Option C) : A dermolipoma is a benign tumor consisting of fat and skin-like tissue . While they may be located in the eye area, they typically present as larger, softer masses , and this does not match the",

      "question": "What is the probable diagnosis of a 35-year-old male with a history of prolonged corneal ulcer who now presents with a deformed eye as shown in the image?",

        "A": "Megalocornea",
        "B": "Conjunctivitis",
        "C": "Buphthalmos",
        "D": "Anterior staphyloma"
      },
      "correct_answer": "D",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: D) Anterior staphyloma Explanation: The history of a prolonged corneal ulcer is suggestive of low body immune response or infection by a virulent strain of bacteria leading to sloughing of the whole cornea, leaving a narrow rim behind along with iris prolapse resulting in the false cornea that cannot withstand raised intraocular pressure and results in forward bulging of the cornea with iris tissue. As a result an ectatic cicatrix forms called Anterior Staphyloma as seen in the image. Staphyloma: It is ectasia of the outer coats of the eye (cornea, sclera, or both) with an incarceration of the uveal tissue. Based on the site affected, staphyloma can be classified as Types of staphyloma Causes Anterior Pseudocornea (following corneal ulcer) (Option D) Intercalary Perforating injuries of the peripheral cornea, marginal corneal ulcer, anterior scleritis, and scleromalacia perforans Ciliary Glaucoma, scleritis, and trauma to the ciliary region Equatorial (approx 14 mm behind the limbus) Scleritis, degenerative myopia, and chronic uncontrolled glaucoma Posterior Degenerative high axial myopia Treatment: Treat underlying condition Local excision and repair with a corneal and scleral patch graft Large staphyloma: Staphylectomy and keratoplasty, or enucleated and replaced with an implant Megalocornea (Option A): Rare bilateral nonprogressive congenital defect that is characterized by an increased corneal diameter greater than 12.5 to 13 mm at birth and a deep anterior chamber with normal intraocular pressures and clear cornea. Conjunctivitis (Option B): Is the inflammation or infection of the transparent membrane that lines your eyelid and eyeball. Typical symptoms include redness and a gritty sensation in your eye, along with itching. Buphthalmos (Option C): Meaning \"bull-like eyes,\" is a condition characterized by the enlargement of the eyeball secondary to congenital Glaucoma . It typically manifests before the age of 3 years and results from the accumulation and retention of aqueous humor. OP185",
