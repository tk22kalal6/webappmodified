      "correct_answer": "D",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: D) Secondary glaucoma Explanation: Secondary glaucoma is not an indication of PK but rather an early complication of the procedure. It is a condition where increased intraocular pressure results from another underlying issue, and it typically requires treatment that addresses the underlying cause of the increased pressure, not corneal replacement. PK addresses corneal diseases and issues directly, not intraocular pressure problems or secondary glaucoma. Penetrating Keratoplasty (PK): It is a type of Allografting (Allo-Keratoplasty) which is the replacement of a patient’s diseased cornea with a healthy donor cornea. Full-thickness grafting. Indications for Penetrating Keratoplasty: Optical Corneal opacity (Option A ruled out) Bullous keratopathy Corneal dystrophies Advanced keratoconus (Option C ruled out) Therapeutic To replace an inflamed cornea that does not respond to conventional therapy Tectonic Graft To restore the integrity of the eyeball, e.g., after corneal perforation or in cases of significant corneal thinning. Cosmetic To improve the appearance of the eye (Option B ruled out) Complications: (ak142) Early Complications: Flat anterior chamber Iris prolapse Infection Secondary glaucoma (Option D) Epithelial defects Primary graft failure Late Complications: Graft rejection Recurrence of disease Astigmatism",

The image provided shows these hallmark signs. Examination Findings in Acanthamoeba Keratitis: Symptoms: Blurred Vision: Common in corneal conditions due to the disruption of the cornea's transparent surface. Discomfort: Significant discomfort in the affected eye. Severe Pain: Pain is often out of proportion to clinical signs, a key clinical clue. Signs: Early Disease: Irregular and Greyish Epithelium : Early sign indicating amoebic invasion. Pseudodendrites : Lesions resembling herpetic keratitis Limbitis and Stromal Infiltrates : Inflammation at the corneal-scleral junction with diffuse or focal infiltrates in the anterior stroma. Perineural Infiltrates (Radial Keratoneuritis) : Hallmark sign, radial streaks extending towards the cornea's centre, pathognomonic for Acanthamoeba keratitis. Advanced Disease: Ring Abscess : Characteristic of advanced infection, where infiltrates form a ring-shaped abscess. Stromal Opacification",

        "D": "Topical corticosteroids"
      },
      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: C) Topical polyhexamethylene biguanide (PHMB) Explanation: The clinical features and findings point to Acanthamoeba keratitis. PHMB is an amoebicidal agent effective against both the trophozoites and cysts of Acanthamoeba. It is the treatment of choice for Acanthamoeba keratitis, especially when cysts are identified. Investigations and Treatment of Acanthamoeba Keratitis: Investigations: Corneal Scraping : The primary method for obtaining tissue for examination. Scrape the margins and base of the lesion after applying a non-preserved topical anaesthetic. Staining : PAS (Periodic acid–Schiff) and Calcofluor white : Highly effective for visualizing Acanthamoeba cysts. Gram and Giemsa stains : Less sensitive but can also demonstrate cysts. Culture : Definitive diagnosis by culturing on non-nutrient agar with dead E. coli. Additional Investigations : Immunohistochemistry : Uses antibodies to detect specific Acanthamoeba antigens. PCR : Useful for detecting Acanthamoeba DNA. In Vivo Confocal Microscopy : Provides detailed images of Acanthamoeba cysts within the cornea. Corneal Biopsy : Considered if other diagnostic methods are inconclusive. Treatment Modalities: Debridement : Removal of infected epithelium to enhance topical medication penetration. Topical Amoebicides : PHMB (polyhexamethylene biguanide) 0.02% and Chlorhexidine 0.02% : Effective against both trophozoites and cysts. Hexamidine : More effective than Propamidine (Brolene) . Topical Steroids : Considered for persistent inflammation after two weeks of anti-amoebic treatment. Caution against use if corneal thinning is present. Pain Management : Oral NSAIDs are recommended for pain relief. Therapeutic Keratoplasty : Required for cases resistant to medical therapy or when corneal perforation occurs. Topical moxifloxacin (Option A): Moxifloxacin is an antibiotic used to treat bacterial keratitis. It is not effective against Acanthamoeba, which is the suspected pathogen in this case based on clinical findings and the presence of cysts. Oral acyclovir (Option B): Acyclovir is an antiviral agent used primarily for herpes simplex keratitis. It is ineffective against Acanthamoeba keratitis. Topical corticosteroids (Option D): While corticosteroids may be used cautiously for persistent inflammation after initiating anti-amoebic treatment, they are not first-line therapy and should be avoided initially due to the risk of worsening the infection if used prematurely.

        "D": "Radial keratoneuritis"
      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: B) Ghost vessels Explanations: The given features describe Syphilitic Interstitial Keratitis . Ghost vessels are remnants of previously filled blood vessels that become empty after the active inflammation of syphilitic interstitial keratitis resolves. They are a characteristic finding during the healing stage of the condition. Interstitial Keratitis (IK): Inflammation of the corneal stroma. Typically does not affect the corneal epithelium or endothelium initially. Causes of IK: Syphilis Other infectious causes include tuberculosis, Lyme disease, parasitic infections (common in endemic areas) Inflammatory/systemic disorders: Sarcoidosis, Cogan syndrome, HSV, VZV Clinical Presentation of Syphilitic Interstitial Keratitis: Aspect Details Symptoms Acute anterior uveitis: Pain, redness, photophobia, blurred vision. Severe blurring of vision during the active phase. Clinical Signs: Active Stage Salmon Patch Appearance : Pinkish-red discoloration due to deep stromal vascularization and clouding. Limbitis : Inflammation at the corneal-scleral junction. Granulomatous Anterior Uveitis : Large inflammatory deposits (keratic precipitates) on the corneal endothelium. Clinical Signs: Healing Stage Ghost Vessels : Empty blood vessels leaving faint tracks. Stromal Scarring : Feathery appearance from scarring. Corneal Thinning : This may lead to irregular astigmatism and vision impairment. Band Keratopathy : Calcium deposition as a late complication. Pseudodendrites (Option A) are typically associated with herpetic keratitis, not with interstitial keratitis caused by syphilis. Ring-shaped abscess (Option C): Ring-shaped abscesses are seen in advanced Acanthamoeba keratitis, not in syphilitic interstitial keratitis. Radial keratoneuritis (Option D) is a hallmark feature of Acanthamoeba keratitis and is not seen in syphilitic interstitial keratitis.",

      },
      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: A) 1,2,3,4 Explanation: Keratoconus Definition : Progressive, non-inflammatory bilateral ectatic corneal condition affecting the axial part. Pathology : Involves progressive thinning and ectasia of the cornea due to defective synthesis of mucopolysaccharides and collagen. Clinical Features Symptoms : Defective vision due to progressive myopia and irregular astigmatism, uncorrectable by glasses. Blurred and distorted vision, glare, halos around lights. Light sensitivity and ocular irritation. Visual loss mainly from irregular astigmatism and myopia; secondary loss due to corneal scarring. Examination Findings Corneal Thinning & Bulging : The Cornea thins near the centre and bulges forward, with the cone apex slightly below the corneal centre. Specific Signs : Distorted Window Reflex : Visual irregularity on corneal reflection. Placido Disc Irregularity : Circles appear irregular. Slit-Lamp Examination : Thinning and ectasia of the central cornea. Opacity at the apex, Fleischer Ring : Brownish ring around the cone, possibly due to haemosiderin in the epithelium. Folds in Descemet's and Bowman's membranes. Vogt Striae : Fine, parallel striae at the apex, best seen with a slit lamp, disappearing with external pressure (vs Haab striae: They are curvilinear breaks in Descemet's membrane, resulting acutely from stretching of the cornea in primary congenital glaucoma). Retinoscopy : Yawning reflex (scissor reflex) with high oblique/irregular astigmatism. Distant Direct Ophthalmoscopy : Annular dark shadow (oil droplet reflex) separating central and peripheral cornea. A ring of shadow concentric with the margin in the red reflex, resembling an oil droplet. Ophthalmoscope Findings : Irregular Astigmatism : Progressive myopia and irregular astigmatism in later stages, poorly corrected by glasses. Munson's Sign : Localized bulging of the lower lid when looking down. Keratometer Findings : Malformed, malaligned, and malfocused mires. Corneal Topography : The most sensitive method for early detection (Forme Fruste Keratoconus) shows the shape of the corneal surface.",

O/E, his corneal topography shows progressive ectasia, and he is advised to consider treatment options to halt disease progression. Which of the following treatments is most appropriate to stabilize the condition and improve contact lens tolerance in this patient?",
      "options": {
        "A": "Spectacle correction",
        "B": "Intracorneal ring segments (INTACS)",
        "C": "Corneal collagen cross-linking (CXL)",
        "D": "Penetrating keratoplasty"
      },
      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: C) Corneal collagen cross-linking (CXL) Explanation: Corneal collagen cross-linking (CXL) is the most appropriate treatment for stabilizing keratoconus progression and improving contact lens tolerance in this patient. It works by strengthening the corneal stroma through the cross-linking of collagen fibres, which helps to halt the progression of ectasia, thereby preserving vision and enhancing the effectiveness of contact lenses. Treatment of Keratoconus Spectacle Correction : Effective in the early stages, but contact lenses are more beneficial. Less effective in later stages due to irregular astigmatism. Contact Lenses : Rigid gas permeable lenses improve vision in early cases. Specially designed scleral lenses (e.g., Rose-K) are useful in early to moderate cases. Corneal Collagen Cross-Linking (CXL) : New treatment modality to slow disease progression. Involves riboflavin (0.1%) eye drops and UVA radiation. Riboflavin induces cross-linking of corneal collagen to stabilize the stroma and improve contact lens tolerance. Keratoplasty : Recommended if disease progresses or in cases of acute hydrops (Descemet's membrane tear). Reserved for more advanced diseases or when other treatments fail. Penetrating keratoplasty is common, but Deep Anterior Lamellar Keratoplasty (DALK) is preferred if Descemet's membrane and endothelium are intact, reducing rejection risk. Intracorneal Ring Segments (INTACS) : Effective in early to moderate cases by flattening the cornea. Less effective in halting progression. Spectacle correction (Option A): Glasses are ineffective in stabilizing or treating corneal ectasia; they only correct refractive errors. Intracorneal ring segments (INTACS) (Option B): INTACS can improve vision by reshaping the cornea, but they do not stop disease progression. They may be used in conjunction with CXL to achieve better outcomes. Penetrating keratoplasty (Option D): This is a full-thickness corneal transplant typically reserved for advanced cases where other treatments have failed. It is not a first-line treatment for early or moderate ectasia. Reference: Kanski’s Clinical Ophthalmology, 9th Edition, Pages 249, 250.",

      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: C) Optisol GS Explanation: Optisol GS is designed for intermediate-term storage, effective for up to 2 weeks, making it suitable for preserving the cornea for up to 10 days. Storage of Cornea Short-term Storage (24 to 96 hours) Intermediate-term Storage (up to 2 weeks) Long-term Preservation (months to years) : Moist Chamber Method : Preserve the whole globe at 4°C in a refrigerator for up to 48 hours. McCarey Kaufman (M-K) Medium : Pink-colored medium containing TC-199, Dextran-40, HEPES buffer, and gentamicin. Optisol GS : Contains chondroitin sulfate, dextran, ascorbic acid, vitamin B12, ATP precursors, gentamicin, and streptomycin. Other Media : Cornisol, Eusol, and Life-GE medium also available for up to 2 weeks. Glycerine Preservation : Effective for 3-4 weeks.

        "D": "Topical antiviral therapy is not recommended to manage eye involvement in HZO."
      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: B) Antiviral therapy is started within 72 hours of rash onset Explanation: Antiviral therapy is most effective when started within 72 hours of rash onset, its effectiveness diminishes significantly after this period. However, treatment may still be considered beyond 72 hours, especially in severe cases, but the benefits are reduced. Treatment of Herpes Zoster Ophthalmicus (HZO): Goals: Reduce viral replication, manage inflammation, and alleviate symptoms. 1. Antiviral Therapy: Early Intervention : Start within 72 hours of rash onset to reduce severity, duration, postherpetic neuralgia, and late ophthalmic complications. Drugs of Choice : Aciclovir : 800 mg five times daily for 7-10 days. Valaciclovir : 1 g three times daily for 7-10 days. Famciclovir : 500 mg three times daily for 7 days. 2. Systemic Steroids: Usage : Often used for moderate to severe HZO, especially with neurological complications; always paired with antivirals. Benefits : Reduces acute pain and expedites skin healing. Drawbacks : No effect on postherpetic neuralgia; avoid immunodeficiency. 3. Topical Treatments: Skin Lesions : Use drying agents, antiseptic solutions, and cold compresses. Eye Involvement : Specific treatments depend on the chronic phase and manifestation. 4. Immunocompromised Patients: Require specialized care. Extended antiviral treatment and possibly intravenous administration. Systemic steroids are generally not recommended. Post-Herpetic Neuralgia: Definition : Pain persisting over a month after rash healing. Prevalence : Up to 75% in patients over 70. (Option C ruled out) Treatment : Stepwise approach with analgesics, tricyclic antidepressants, anticonvulsants like gabapentin, and potentially opioids. Systemic steroids alone are sufficient to manage HZO (Option A): Systemic steroids should not be used as a monotherapy for HZO. They must be combined with antiviral therapy to manage inflammation and pain effectively, as steroids alone do not reduce viral replication or prevent complications. Topical antiviral therapy is not recommended to manage eye involvement in HZO (Option D): Topical antiviral therapy in combination with systemic antiviral therapy is the standard of care for managing the viral infection.

      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Correct answer: C) Perform mechanical debridement and apply tissue adhesive glue Explanation: Mechanical debridement is necessary to remove necrotic material and promote healing in a non-healing ulcer. Tissue adhesive glue is indicated to prevent perforation, especially when the perforation is less than 2mm. Management of Non-Healing Ulcers Management of Impending Perforation Identify and Remove Causes : Local factors (e.g., ↑ IOP, foreign bodies, dacryocystitis) and systemic factors (e.g., diabetes, malnutrition) causing non-healing. Mechanical Debridement : Scrape the ulcer floor to remove necrotic material under local anaesthesia to promote healing. Cauterization : Using pure carbolic acid or 10-20% trichloroacetic acid in non-responding cases. Bandage Soft Contact Lens : To aid healing by protecting the corneal surface. Peritomy : Sever perilimbal conjunctival vessels to reduce excessive vascularization hindering healing. Avoid Strain : Avoid sneezing, coughing, and straining, and maintain strict bed rest. Pressure Bandage : To provide external support to the cornea. Lower Intraocular Pressure : Use acetazolamide, mannitol, oral glycerol, timolol eye drops, and paracentesis if needed. Tissue Adhesive Glue : Apply cyanoacrylate glue to prevent perforation, if perforation <2mm . Bandage Soft Contact Lens : Used to support and protect the cornea. Conjunctival Flap : Cover the cornea partially or completely with a conjunctival flap for additional support. Amniotic Membrane Transplantation Penetrating Therapeutic Keratoplasty : Perform a tectonic graft if suitable and available to prevent perforation or repair a perforated cornea if perforation >2-4mm. Increasing the frequency of antibiotic eye drops (Option A) alone may not be sufficient in a case of impending perforation. Applying a pressure bandage and bed rest (Option B) helps, but alone it is not sufficient without addressing the structural integrity of the cornea.

      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Correct answer: B) Endothelium Explanation: The innermost layer of the cornea is the endothelium which consists of a single layer of hexagonal cells. These cells are crucial for maintaining corneal transparency by regulating fluid balance within the cornea through an active pump mechanism. Layers of Cornea Epithelium (Option C ruled out) The outermost layer comprises 5-6 layers of non-keratinized, stratified squamous epithelial cells. Acts as a barrier, protecting the cornea and preventing tear fluid from entering the underlying stroma. The basal cells at the limbus are stem cells responsible for regenerating the corneal epithelium. Bowman’s Membrane (Option D ruled out) Located just beneath the epithelium, this acellular layer is 12 µm thick and composed of densely packed collagen fibrils. It is a protective barrier to the stroma but cannot regenerate if damaged and heals by scarring. Stroma (Option A ruled out) Making up about 90% of the cornea's thickness (approximately 0.5 mm thick), the stroma consists of collagen fibrils arranged in parallel layers. These fibrils are embedded in a hydrated matrix of proteoglycans - Chondroitin and Keratan Sulphate (keratan sulphate maintains corneal transparency). Pre-Descemet's Membrane (Dua's Layer) This layer, discovered in 2013, is about 15 µm thick, acellular, and lies just above Descemet's membrane. It is strong and resistant to air penetration. Descemet's Membrane A robust basement membrane of the corneal endothelium is made of collagen and glycoproteins. It is tense, but when torn, curls inwards on itself. It can regenerate if damaged and is resistant to trauma and pathological processes. Endothelium (Option B) The innermost layer consists of a single layer of flat, hexagonal cells.

      "explanation": "Correct Answer: B) Aerobic Explanation: The primary metabolism of the cornea is aerobic, where oxygen is used to generate energy, mainly through oxidative phosphorylation. This is possible due to the oxygen supply from the tear film and the atmosphere, despite the cornea’s lack of blood vessels. While the cornea does have some anaerobic metabolic processes, its primary metabolism is aerobic. Activation of anaerobic glycolysis leads to lactic acid formation, resulting in metabolic acidosis causing inhibition of sodium- potassium pump, in turn leading to corneal edema. (Option A) The primary metabolism of the lens is anaerobic , as it lacks blood vessels, and it relies on anaerobic glycolysis to generate ATP. While both anaerobic and aerobic pathways are involved in corneal metabolism, aerobic metabolism is dominant. (Option C) Reference: Kanski’s Clinical Ophthalmology, 9th Edition, Page 204.",

      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Correct answer: B) Perforating Ulcer Explanation: Chronic use of corticosteroid eye drops can lead to thinning and weakening of the corneal tissue, making it more susceptible to deep infections. When a corneal ulcer extends deep into the stroma, nearing Descemet's membrane, there is a high risk of perforation. A perforating ulcer is a severe form of bacterial keratitis where the ulceration penetrates deeply, potentially leading to full-thickness corneal perforation. The description of the ulcer penetrating deeply into the corneal stroma, approaching Descemet's membrane, suggests a Perforating Ulcer . Types of Bacterial Keratitis Localized Ulcer Perforating Ulcer Adherent Leucoma Sloughing Ulcer Begins with infiltration of inflammatory cells. Leads to necrosis and sloughing of corneal tissue. Healing occurs with epithelialization and scarring. Deep penetration of ulcer reaching Descemet's membrane. Risk of perforation with any strain, leading to intraocular complications. Small perforations opposite the iris may heal rapidly, forming an adherent leucoma Occurs when a small perforation is plugged by the iris. Results in scar formation with permanent opacity. Rapidly spreads across the cornea due to virulent organisms or weak immunity . This leads to complete corneal destruction, iris prolapse, and formation of an anterior staphyloma with a pseudocornea. Investigations for Bacterial Keratitis Corneal Scraping : Obtained from ulcer edges and base after local anaesthesia and using a Kimura spatula. Culture Media : Blood, chocolate, and thioglycollate broth for bacteria; non-nutrient agar for Acanthamoeba. Staining : Gram and Giemsa stains to identify pathogens and analyze cell morphology. Localized Ulcers (Option A) do not typically penetrate as deeply and remain more superficial. Adherent Leucoma (Option C) refers to a corneal opacity that adheres to the underlying iris, often resulting from the healing of a corneal ulcer with iris involvement. It is more of a sequela of a previous ulcer rather than an active form of bacterial keratitis. Sloughing Ulcer (Option D) refers to the shedding of necrotic corneal tissue, often leading to a large area of ulceration. While severe, it generally describes the process of tissue loss rather than the specific risk of perforation that occurs with deeper stromal involvement, as seen in perforating ulcers.

In fact, corneal neovascularization is typically absent , especially in the acute stages. The following options are typical examination findings in keratomycosis: Keratomycosis (Fungal Keratitis): Aspect Description Clinical Features • Pain and foreign body sensation • Watering of the eye • Photophobia • Blurred vision • Redness Typical Examination Findings • Corneal Ulcer : Greyish-white, dry, with elevated rolled-out margins • Pigmented Ulcer : Seen with dematiaceous fungi • Feathery Extensions : Branching extensions into surrounding stroma (Option A) • Sterile Immune Ring : Immune complex deposition (Option C) • Satellite Lesions : Small lesions near main ulcer • Hypopyon : Large, often non-sterile • Endothelial Plaque : Dense accumulation of fibrin and leukocytes beneath lesion (Option D) • Corneal Vascularization : Absent , especially in early disease ( Option B is not seen ) Complications • Rare corneal perforation • Potential progression to endophthalmitis Key Investigations • Corneal Scraping : For smears and culture • KOH Mount : Septate hyphae (Aspergillus, Fusarium) or yeast-like cells (Candida) • Gram & Giemsa Stains : Inflammatory cells and fungal elements • Culture : Sabouraud dextrose agar • PCR : For early pathogen detection • Confocal Microscopy : In vivo fungal visualization • Anterior Chamber Paracentesis / Biopsy : If needed for deeper infection Feathery extensions at the margins of the corneal ulcer (Option A): These are characteristic finger-like projections at the ulcer margins caused by filamentous fungi. Sterile immune ring (Option C): Also known as Wessely ring, formed at the interface of fungal antigens and host antibodies. Endothelial plaque (Option D): Dense, whitish deposits of fibrin and leukocytes under the stromal lesion.",

        "A": "Topical Moxifloxacin",
        "B": "Topical Natamycin",
        "C": "Oral Acyclovir",
        "D": "Intravitreal Amphotericin B"
      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: B) Topical Natamycin Explanation: The history of trauma with plant material, along with the presence of a corneal ulcer with feathery edges and satellite lesions, is highly suggestive of fungal keratitis . Natamycin is the first-line treatment for fungal keratitis, especially caused by filamentous fungi like Fusarium and Aspergillus . It is effective in treating the type of fungal infection that is suggested by the clinical presentation in this patient. Treatment of Keratomycosis (Fungal Corneal Ulcer): Primary Treatment: Antifungal Medications: Topical Antifungal Agents: Natamycin Voriconazole Amphotericin B (effective against Aspergillus and Fusarium ) Nystatin (effective against Candida ) Oral Antifungal Agents (for severe ulcers with specific features): Ketoconazole Voriconazole Indications for Oral Therapy: Hypopyon Perforation Suspicion of endophthalmitis Surgical Management (if unresponsive to medical therapy): Repeated Scraping: Removal of necrotic material Cauterization Options: Pure carbolic acid (100%) Trichloroacetic acid (10%–20%) Povidone-iodine 5% Therapeutic Keratoplasty: Corneal transplantation Management of Suspected Endophthalmitis: Ultrasound : To check for exudates in the vitreous Vitreous Tap & intravitreal injections of antibiotics and antifungals (amphotericin B) if confirmed Surgical Options (if medical therapy fails): Corneal graft Conjunctival flap Topical Moxifloxacin (Option A): Moxifloxacin is an antibiotic effective against bacterial infections, not fungal infections. Given the history of trauma with plant material and the appearance of a corneal ulcer with feathery edges and satellite lesions, the most likely diagnosis is fungal keratitis. Therefore, moxifloxacin would not be appropriate. Oral Acyclovir (Option C): Acyclovir is an antiviral medication used primarily for herpes simplex virus infections. It would not be effective for a fungal corneal ulcer, making it an inappropriate choice in this scenario. Intravitreal Amphotericin B (Option D): Intravitreal Amphotericin B is used in cases of fungal endophthalmitis, not as an initial treatment for keratitis. Although hypopyon suggests severe infection, the primary treatment should still be topical antifungal agents unless there is confirmed or high suspicion of endophthalmitis requiring intravitreal therapy.

      },
      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: C) Herpes Simplex Virus (HSV) Explanations: HSV keratitis is characterized by dendritic ulcers on the cornea, which are branching, tree-like lesions. HSV also commonly causes decreased corneal sensation. Examination Findings in Viral Keratitis: Signs: Swollen Epithelial Cells: Early signs presenting as swollen, opaque cells in a coarse punctate or stellate pattern. Dendritic Ulcer: Characteristic linear, branching ulcer with terminal bulbs; stains with fluorescein. Geographic Ulcer: Enlarged amoeboid-shaped ulcer, often due to inappropriate steroid use. Rose Bengal Staining: Stains virus-laden cells at the ulcer edges, aiding in differentiation from other conditions. Reduced Corneal Sensation: Result of corneal nerve damage. Subepithelial Haze: Mild haziness was observed in the subepithelial layer. Anterior Chamber Activity: Mild inflammatory reaction in the anterior chamber. Elevated IOP: Increased intraocular pressure, requiring monitoring. Persistent Punctate Erosions (PEE): Residual erosions and epithelial irregularities after healing, resolving spontaneously without indicating recurrence. Specific Findings Based on Virus Type: 1) Herpes Simplex Virus (HSV) Keratitis: Dendritic Ulcers: Branching, tree-like ulcers. Geographic Ulcers: Larger, amoeboid-shaped ulcers. Stromal Keratitis: Inflammation of the corneal stroma, leading to oedema, infiltrates, and scarring. Disciform Keratitis: Central, disc-shaped inflammation in the stroma. 2) Herpes Zoster Ophthalmicus (HZO): (Option B) Vesicles and Scars: Painful rash and blisters following the involvement of ophthalmic division of the trigeminal nerve. Nummular Keratitis: Large, coin-shaped, subepithelial corneal infiltrates. Scleritis: Inflammation of the sclera, causing pain and redness. Iritis: Inflammation of the iris leading to pain, photophobia, and blurred vision. 3) Adenovirus (Option A): Adenoviruses are known for causing epidemic keratoconjunctivitis (EKC) and may present with conjunctivitis and keratitis. They are less likely to cause dendritic ulcers, which are specific to HSV. 4) Chlamydia trachomatis (Option D): Chlamydia typically causes trachoma or inclusion conjunctivitis, which may involve conjunctival scarring and corneal pannus, but not dendritic ulcers.",

      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: C) Topical acyclovir and cycloplegics Explanation: The patient presents with pain, redness, photophobia, and decreased vision in the right eye, along with a dendritic ulcer on the cornea. This clinical picture is classic for Herpes Simplex Keratitis (HSK), an infection of the cornea caused by the herpes simplex virus (HSV). Treatment: Topical Acyclovir: This antiviral medication is the first-line treatment for HSV keratitis. It directly targets the herpes simplex virus, reducing viral replication and promoting healing of the corneal ulcer. Cycloplegics: These medications help to relieve pain caused by ciliary muscle spasms and prevent the formation of synechiae (adhesions) in the iris. Treatment of Herpes Simplex Virus (HSV) Keratitis: Topical Therapy: Antivirals: Common Agents: Aciclovir 3% ointment: 5 times daily. Ganciclovir 0.15% gel: 5 times daily. Trifluridine: Up to 9 times daily. Older Agents: Idoxuridine and vidarabine (less common due to lower efficacy/higher toxicity). Other Topical Medications: Antibiotics: Prevent secondary bacterial infections, especially with epithelial defects. Cycloplegics: (e.g., Homatropine 1%) Relieve pain and photophobia by paralyzing ciliary muscles and dilating the pupil. Steroids: Epithelial Keratitis: Contraindicated due to the risk of worsening infection and corneal perforation. Stromal Keratitis: Used cautiously with antivirals to control inflammation and reduce scarring. Oral Therapy: Antivirals: Indications: immunocompromised patients, children, severe ocular surface disease, intolerance/resistance to topical treatment. Prophylaxis: L ow-dose oral acyclovir (400 mg twice daily) reduces recurrence. Alternatives include valaciclovir (500 mg once daily) and famciclovir. Steroids: Generally avoided but may be used with caution in severe stromal inflammation as an adjunct to topical therapy. Surgical Management: Debridement: Removal of infected epithelial cells, helpful in resistant epithelial keratitis. Keratoplasty: Indication: Severe corneal scarring after at least a year of infection-free status. Risk of Recurrence: HSV keratitis may recur post-keratoplasty. Eyes with extensive corneal vascularization are at higher risk of graft rejection and recurrence. Prophylactic oral acyclovir is recommended. Topical steroids and antibiotics (Option A): Topical steroids are contraindicated in the treatment of active epithelial HSV keratitis, as they can suppress the immune response and worsen the viral infection, potentially leading to complications like corneal perforation. Antibiotics are not needed unless there is a secondary bacterial infection, which is not indicated here. Oral acyclovir and lubricants (Option B): While oral acyclovir is used in more severe or recurrent cases of HSV keratitis, topical acyclovir is preferred as the initial treatment. Lubricants can be supportive but are not the primary treatment. Oral steroids and topical antibiotics (Option D): Oral steroids are contraindicated in HSV keratitis,",

      },
      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: C) Neurotrophic Keratopathy Explanation: Neurotrophic keratopathy is characterized by decreased corneal sensation and epithelial desquamation due to trigeminal nerve damage or dysfunction. The patient’s history of Gasserian ganglion block, a procedure known to impair the trigeminal nerve, strongly supports this diagnosis. Causes of Decreased Corneal Sensation: Herpes Simplex Virus (HSV) Infections (Option B) : HSV keratitis typically presents with dendritic ulcers on the cornea and is associated with pain, photophobia, and possibly vesicular skin lesions. However, the history of a Gasserian ganglion block and the description of decreased corneal sensation point more toward neurotrophic keratopathy. Herpes Zoster Ophthalmicus: Caused by varicella zoster virus. Leads to decreased corneal sensation. Ocular complications include: Punctate epithelial keratitis. Nummular keratitis. Stromal keratitis. Iridocyclitis. Scleritis. Keratomalacia (Option A) Result of vitamin A deficiency. The cornea becomes dull and insensitive. Signs include haziness and yellow infiltrates (not seen in this patient) Can progress to corneal necrosis. Neurotrophic Keratopathy (Option C): Caused by trigeminal nerve paralysis. Decreased corneal sensation and epithelial desquamation. May follow procedures like Gasserian ganglion removal or blockage, often used in treating trigeminal neuralgia. Neuroparalytic Keratopathy (Option D): This condition occurs due to facial nerve paralysis , leading to lagophthalmos (inability to close the eye) and subsequent corneal exposure. The patient's history does not suggest facial nerve paralysis, making this less likely. Reference: Kanski’s Clinical Ophthalmology, 9th Edition, Page 223.",

      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: B) Corneal Scarring Explanations: This is a chronic complication that can develop after the acute phase of herpes zoster ophthalmicus. It results from damage to the cornea due to keratitis and can lead to vision impairment. Ocular Manifestations of Herpes Zoster Ophthalmicus (HZO): Hutchinson’s rule: The eye will be involved if the nose tip is involved. As it indicates nasociliary nerve involvement. Vesicles are present on the nose. Whenever there is involvement of the nose and skin lesions, this is called the Htchinson’s sign. Acute Ocular Manifestations: Conjunctivitis : Redness and inflammation of the conjunctiva. (Option C ruled out) Keratitis: Punctate Epithelial Keratitis: Coarse and irregular lesions. Nummular Keratitis: Larger, disc-shaped lesions. Disciform keratitis. Iridocyclitis: Inflammation of the iris and ciliary body, causing pain, photophobia, and blurred vision. Keratouveitis and endothelitis: Leads to acute endothelial cell loss Episcleritis and Scleritis: Inflammation of the episclera or sclera, resulting in pain and redness. (Option A ruled out) Chronic Ocular Manifestations: Post-herpetic neuralgia: When pain persists despite the resolution of the eruptive phase. In the long term, this leads to some anaesthesia in the affected skin, known as anaesthesia dolorosa. Corneal lesions: Neuroparalytic ulceration. Neurotrophic Keratopathy Corneal scarring Exposure keratitis Mucous plaque keratitis (Sudden development of elevated mucous plaque which stains on rose bengal) Lid lesions: D/t scarring. Include ptosis, trichiasis & entropion. Secondary Glaucoma : Increased intraocular pressure (IOP) leading to optic nerve damage and vision loss. Recurrent Infections: Less common and usually milder than the initial episode. Secondary Glaucoma (Option D): While secondary glaucoma is a chronic complication of herpes zoster ophthalmicus, it is more related to increased intraocular pressure due to inflammation or damage. Corneal scarring is a direct result of keratitis and is specifically related to the chronic effects on the cornea, making it a more direct chronic complication from the given options.
