      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "movement is controlled by the lateral rectus muscle, which is innervated by the abducens nerve (cranial nerve VI). Functions of muscle supplied by oculomotor nerve: Superior rectus (SR) Medial rectus (MR) Inferior rectus (IR) Levator palpebrae superioris (LPS) Inferior oblique (IO) Elevation Adduction Intorsion Adduction (Option A ruled out) Depression Adduction Extorsion Elevation of superior eyelid (Option D ruled out) Elevation Abduction Extorsion Oculomotor nerve (cranial nerve III) Type Motor Origin Midbrain (Oculomotor sulcus on the medial aspect of the cerebral peduncle). Course Components 1. Oculomotor nucleus (somatic component): General somatic efferent (GSE) fibres emerge from this site and supply - Superior division : Levator palpebrae superioris Superior rectus Inferior division : Medial rectus Inferior rectus Inferior oblique 2.Edinger-Westphal nucleus (parasympathetic component) (Option C ruled out) : General visceral efferent (GVE) fibres arise from this site and supply: Sphincter pupillae- causes pupil constriction Ciliaris Note: The nerve fibers innervating the pupillary muscles are located superficially in the nerve trunk and pial blood vessels supply these fibers. The main trunk of the fibers is supplied by the vasa vasorum. Diabetic and hypertensive microangiopathy will affect the vasa vasorum and thus spare the pupillary fibers. Hence, pupil-sparing 3rd nerve lesions are seen with ischemic lesions such as diabetes, hypertension, or arteriosclerotic disease.",

      "question": "In Fundus Fluorescein Angiography (FFA), how do microaneurysms appear?",
      "options": {
        "A": "Hypofluorescent dots",
        "B": "Hyperfluorescent dots",
        "C": "Hypofluorescent line",
        "D": "Hyperfluorescent branching-like structure in the vessel"
      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "small, round dilations of retinal capillaries. In Fundus Fluorescein Angiography (FFA), they exhibit hyperfluorescence due to leakage of fluorescein dye from these abnormal capillaries. Microaneurysms initially appear as hyperfluorescent dots in early-phase FFA due to accumulation of fluorescein dye. In later phases, leakage may lead to diffuse hyperfluorescence in severe cases. Fundus Fluorescein Angiography Principle: Based on the detection of fluorescent light emitted by fluorescein dye in circulation. Absorption & Emission Wavelengths: Irradiating light: 420–490 nm. Emitted fluorescence: 510–530 nm. Retinal pigments and red blood cells can absorb fluorescent light, masking deeper structures. Pigment migration allows visibility of deeper layers. Diagnostic uses: Diabetic Retinopathy: Reveals neovascularization, and assesses vascular tree integrity. Fundus Disorders: Identifies depth of pathological involvement. Optic Nerve Pathologies: Useful in detecting optic nerve issues such as papilloedema. Neovascularization of Iris: Detects leakage from iris vessels, an early sign of rubeosis. Normal Study Hypofluorescent dots (Option A): Microaneurysms do not appear hypofluorescent. Hypofluorescent lesions are usually blockages (e.g., hemorrhages, pigment deposits) or vascular occlusions. Hypofluorescent line (Option C): Hypofluorescent lines are seen in conditions like vascular occlusions (e.g., branch retinal artery occlusion). Hyperfluorescent branching-like structure in the vessel (Option D): This pattern is seen in neovascularization, not microaneurysms.",

      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "capsulorrhexis and IOL placement surgery (phacoemulsification) to maintain anterior chamber stability, protect intraocular tissues, and facilitate intraocular lens (IOL) implantation. Cause mechanical injury to corneal endothelium (Option A): Viscoelastic substances are protective, not damaging, to the corneal endothelium. Some high-viscosity viscoelastics (e.g., Healon GV) can increase intraocular pressure if not completely removed, but they do not cause direct mechanical injury. It is inert and can be left behind after surgery (Option C): Viscoelastic substances are not inert and must be removed at the end of surgery to prevent postoperative intraocular pressure (IOP) elevation. Residual viscoelastics can obstruct aqueous outflow, leading to IOP spikes. Silicone oil, perfluoropropane, and sodium hexafluoride are most commonly used substances (Option D): Silicone oil, perfluoropropane (C3F8), and sulfur hexafluoride (SF6) are not viscoelastic substances; they are tamponade agents used in retinal surgeries (e.g., retinal detachment repair). Commonly used ophthalmic viscoelastic devices (OVDs) include: Sodium hyaluronate (Healon, ProVisc) Hydroxypropyl methylcellulose (HPMC) Chondroitin sulfate-based OVDs (Viscoat) Reference: Viscoelastics - StatPearls - NCBI Bookshelf Agents for Vitreous Tamponade - StatPearls - NCBI Bookshelf",

A concave cylinder at 180 ± 20 degrees or a convex cylinder at 90 ± 20 is required for this kind of astigmatism. -3.00 DC x 180, +1.00 DC x 90 - This combination of lenses corrects with-the-rule astigmatism.

      "options": {
        "A": "1,2,3,4 and 5",

        "D": "1,3 and 4"
      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: B) 2 and 3 Explanation: To differentiate a fixed dilated pupil, the use of specific pharmacological agents can be helpful. Pilocarpine is a parasympathomimetic drug that stimulates the pupillary sphincter muscle, causing miosis (constriction of the pupil). If the dilated pupil responds to pilocarpine and constricts, it indicates that the dilated pupil is likely due to parasympathetic denervation or dysfunction. Normal pupil react to 1% pilocarpine below this concentration, normal pupil don't react. Reference: Yanoff & Duker Ophthalmology, 5th edition, Pg 965,966,968",
