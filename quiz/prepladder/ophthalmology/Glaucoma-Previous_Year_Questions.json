      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "(excessive tearing) in the child in the picture are indicative of congenital glaucoma. Congenital glaucoma refers to a form of glaucoma that is present at birth or develops within the first few years of life. It is typically caused by abnormalities in the eye's drainage system, leading to increased intraocular pressure. Incorrect Options : Option B) Retinoblastoma: Retinoblastoma is a rare childhood eye cancer that affects the retina, the light-sensitive tissue at the back of the eye. While retinoblastoma can present with various symptoms, such as leukocoria (white pupil), strabismus (misalignment of the eyes), and decreased vision, the specific symptoms mentioned in the question, such as large corneas and lacrimation, are not typical manifestations of retinoblastoma. Option C) Congenital hereditary endothelial dystrophy: Congenital hereditary endothelial dystrophy (CHED) is a rare genetic disorder that affects the cornea, specifically the endothelial cells responsible for maintaining corneal transparency. Symptoms of CHED usually include cloudy or hazy corneas, decreased vision, and sometimes nystagmus (involuntary eye movements). While the child in the picture has large corneas, photophobia, and lacrimation, these symptoms are more suggestive of congenital glaucoma rather than CHED. Option D) Megalocornea: Megalocornea is a condition characterized by abnormally large corneas. It is often inherited and can be associated with other ocular abnormalities. While megalocornea can be asymptomatic or associated with mild visual disturbances, the presence of photophobia and lacrimation in the child suggests a more likely diagnosis of congenital glaucoma, which is specifically associated with increased intraocular pressure and related symptoms.

      "explanation": "female presenting with an acute painful red-eye and an image showing redness and congestion which gives a diagnosis of Acute angle-closure glaucoma. Acute Angle Closure Glaucoma: Acute angle-closure glaucoma is a sudden and severe form of glaucoma characterized by a rapid increase in intraocular pressure. It occurs when the drainage angle of the eye becomes blocked, leading to a buildup of fluid and pressure within the eye. Clinical features of Glaucoma are: Sudden Painful eye. A ciliary flush around the cornea due to dilated ciliary veins, and in long-standing cases, caput medusae with prominent vessels. Cornea - initially clear but insensitive, later becoming hazy, with epithelial bullae (bullous keratopathy) or filaments (filamentary keratitis). Headache and nausea: Some individuals may experience accompanying headache, nausea, and even vomiting. Anterior chamber - very shallow. Iris - atrophic. Pupil - fixed and dilated. Optic disc - glaucomatous optic atrophy. IOP is high and the eyeball becomes stony hard. Management of absolute glaucoma In absolute glaucoma, the goal of treatment is to relieve pain and reduce IOP, as vision cannot be restored. Retrobulbar alcohol injection - given to relieve pain. First, 1 mL of 2% xylocaine is injected followed after about 5-10 minutes by 1 mL of 80% alcohol. It suppresses the ciliary ganglion. A cyclodestructive procedure, such as cyclocryotherapy or cyclophotocoagulation, is the most appropriate management option in this scenario as it reduces aqueous production by damaging the secretory ciliary processes aiming to reduce IOP. If pain persists despite cyclodestruction, enucleation/ evisceration may be considered. Incorrect Options Acute retrobulbar neuritis (Option A) , also known as optic neuritis, typically presents with vision loss, eye pain, and decreased color vision. It is not characterized by redness and congestion of",

Medical: The drugs either decrease the formation of aqueous or increase the drainage to decrease IOP. This is of 2 types: Topical (6 types) Systemic (2 types) Topical: Beta-blockers These decrease the formation of aqueous Eg: Timolol (Option A) , betaxolol C/I in asthma S/E: corneal anesthesia and blepharoconjunctivitis Alpha agonists: They have dual action i.e. they decrease the formation of aqueous and increase the trabecular outflow. Eg: Adrenaline/epinephrine, dipivefrin, brimonidine, and apraclonidine Brimonidine is safe in pregnancy Adrenaline is C/I in aphakic glaucoma Miotics: These increase the trabecular outflow and open the angle blockage Eg: Pilocarpine (Option C) S/E of Pilocarpine: Pseudo myopia, retinal detachment, shallow anterior chamber, iris cysts Topical carbonic anhydrase inhibitors: These decrease the formation of aqueous Eg: dorzolamide and brinzolamide These are C/I in sulpha allergies Newer anti-glaucoma drugs: Netarsudil: this increases the contractile property of the trabecular meshwork, thus increasing the trabecular outflow and it also decreases the aqueous production. It is a Rho-kinase inhibitor S/E: vortex keratopathy PGF2 alpha agonist: It increases the uveoscleral outflow These are also contraindicated in uveitis and asthma For eg- Latanoprost (Option B) , bimatoprost, travoprost , tafluprost, and unoprostone isopropyl Latanoprost causes heterochromia iridis Bimatoprost increases both uveoscleral and trabecular outflow Side effects: Hypertrichosis Systemic: Carbonic anhydrase inhibitor For eg: acetazolamide (Option D) , methazolamide S/E: Tingling and numbness, constipation, renal stones, and a bad metallic taste Hyperosmotic agents: These draw aqueous out of the eye For eg: I/V mannitol (C/I in heart disease), glycerol (C/I in diabetes), isosorbide, and urea Reference: Kanski Clinical Ophthalmology, 10th edition, Pages 369, 370, 374, 380 Parsons’ Diseases of the Eye, 23rd Edition, PDF Pages 724, 725",

      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Characteristics: Intraocular Pressure: Elevated (>21 mm Hg) on multiple occasions. Anterior Chamber Angle: Open and normal in appearance (Statement 3) . Optic Disc: Characteristic cupping , normal C:D ratio in early stages (Statement 5) . Visual Field: Specific defects present. Risk Factors: Elevated IOP: Asymmetry of IOP of ≥ 4 mmHg is considered significant. (Option A) Family History: Higher risk in siblings (10%) (Statement 4) and offspring (4%). Involves polygenic inheritance with genes like MYOC, OPTN, and WDR36 . (Option C) Age: Increased risk with age, especially between the 5th and 7th decades of life. Race: Higher prevalence and severity in Black individuals compared to Whites. Myopia: Increased risk in myopic individuals. (Option D) Thinner Central Corneal Thickness (CCT) (<555 µm) is an independent risk factor. Cigarette Smoking: Increased risk Blood Pressure: Higher prevalence in hypertensives; diastolic perfusion pressure <55 mm Hg is a significant risk factor. (Option B) Thyrotoxicosis: Increased in Graves' ophthalmic disease. Corticosteroid Responsiveness: Greater risk of IOP rise with topical steroid therapy (Statement 2). Pathogenesis: The rise in IOP in POAG occurs due to decreased aqueous outflow facility. This is caused by trabecular meshwork stiffening and apposition of Schlemm's canal wall. Contributing factors include thickening and sclerosis of the trabecular meshwork, narrowing of intertrabecular spaces, deposition of amorphous material in the juxtacanalicular space, and collapse of Schlemm's canal. Abnormality of trabecular meshwork is seen on gonioscopy (Statement 1) although trabecular meshwork is seen in gonioscopy, abnormalities in the trabecular meshwork cannot be observed during gonioscopy.

      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer A - Marcus Gunn pupil Relative Afferent Pupillary Defect (RAPD) : The pupils paradoxically dilate when the flashlight is swung from the unaffected to the affected eye due to the decreased light perception. This is also called the Marcus Gunn Pupil (Option A) (first sign of optic nerve disorder). Causes: Optic neuritis Optic neuropathy Chiasmal compression Intraocular hemorrhage Central serous retinopathy Cystoid macular edema Retinal detachment Optic tract lesion Central or branch arterial occlusion Central or branch vein occlusion Anisometropic amblyopia Cataract Corneal scar Visual pathway damage Tested by Swinging Flashlight Test . A bright flashlight is shone onto one pupil, causing constriction, then quickly moved to the opposite pupil to observe its response. This process is repeated multiple times to assess the pupillary reactions. Normally, both pupils constrict equally, but the pupil to which light is transferred remains tightly constricted. In RAPD, the affected pupil dilates when the flashlight moves from the normal to the abnormal eye. The dilatation that occurs is commonly called the Marcus Gunn pupil or RAPD (Relative afferent pupillary defect). Adie’s Pupil (Option B) shows no reaction to light, and the near reflex is very slow and tonic. It shows pupillary constriction to 0.125% Pilocarpine due to denervation supersensitivity. Seen in Postganglionic parasympathetic pupillomotor damage. Argyll Robertson Pupil (ARP) (Option C) shows reaction to near reflex, but light reflex (both direct and consensual) is absent, i.e. there is light near dissociation. Seen in Neurosyphilis Hutchinson’s pupil (Option D) This refers to a fixed, dilated pupil due to a midbrain lesion or uncal herniation. It is not typically seen in glaucoma.",

      "explanation": "glaucoma . This is because atropine is an anticholinergic that causes pupil dilation, which can exacerbate the already elevated intraocular pressure in acute congestive (or angle-closure) glaucoma by further obstructing the drainage of aqueous humor from the eye. This can worsen the condition. Over 60 drugs have been linked to acute angle-closure (AAC) glaucoma, particularly in individuals with ocular predispositions. These include topical anticholinergic pupil dilators (e.g., atropine, cyclopentolate) and systemic medications such as topiramate, sulfonamides, duloxetine, and phenothiazines. Patients on these medications, especially those with AAC risk factors, should have regular ophthalmic examinations. Acute anterior uveitis (Option B): Atropine can be beneficial in this condition as it helps to relieve ciliary muscle spasms, reduces pain, prevents the formation of posterior synechiae, and keeps the pupil mobile. Malignant glaucoma (Option C): Atropine is the first line of treatment for management of malignant glaucoma. It dilates the ciliary ring and relaxes the ciliary muscles which causes stretching of zonules that will pull back the lens, thus opening the block. Corneal ulcer (Option D): Atropine can be used in this case to help relieve pain associated with ciliary muscle spasms, reduces pain, prevents the formation of posterior synechiae, and improve vascularity.

      "explanation": "Correct Answer: A) Congenital glaucoma Explanation: True Congenital Glaucoma is characterized by elevated intraocular pressure present during intrauterine life, resulting in ocular enlargement at birth . The presence of Haab’s striae, early onset, enlarged corneas, and the classic triad of symptoms (watering, photophobia, and blepharospasm) are all consistent with newborn glaucoma. Primary Congenital Glaucoma Types 1. Newborn glaucoma/ True congenital glaucoma : Elevated intraocular pressure is present during intrauterine life, resulting in ocular enlargement at birth . (40% cases) Typically presents within the first month of life. Often associated with developmental anomalies of the anterior segment, such as primary congenital glaucoma, which can result from genetic mutations or other congenital conditions. 2. Infantile: ≤ 3 yrs of age - Infantile glaucoma is labelled when the disease manifests prior to the child's third birthday Affects infants older than 1 month and children up to 3 years. Can also result from genetic factors or be secondary to other conditions like Sturge-Weber syndrome or other syndromic associations. 3. Juvenile: > 3 yrs of age who develop pressure rise after 3 years but before adulthood. Also known as Juvenile primary open angle glaucoma(POAG) usually occurs between 10 to 35 years of age. Buphthalmos , meaning \"bull-like eyes,\" is a condition characterized by the enlargement of the eyeball. It typically manifests before the age of 3 years and results from the accumulation and retention of aqueous humor. Pathogenesis Trabeculodysgenesis: Maldevelopment of the trabeculum and iridotrabecular junction from neural crest cells impairs aqueous outflow, causing elevated IOP. Angle Recess Absence: The angle recess is absent, with the iris inserting either flatly or concavely into the trabeculum. Iris Insertion Types: Flat Insertion: Reveals the ciliary body and scleral spur. Concave Insertion: Obscures the scleral spur and ciliary body. Clinical Features",

      },
      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: C) Goldmann applanation tonometer Explanation: Types of Tonometry: 1. Indentation Tonometry: Concept: Measures IOP by how much a plunger indents the eye; softer eyes indent more than harder eyes. Schiotz Tonometer: Most widely used tonometer in the world. Advantages: Inexpensive, simple, and reliable. Disadvantages: Gives false readings in eyes with abnormal scleral rigidity (e.g., high myopes, post-surgery). 2. Applanation Tonometry: Concept: Measures IOP based on the force needed to flatten the cornea's surface (Imbert-Fick Law: P = W/A). Goldmann Tonometer (Option B): Most popular and accurate; uses a double prism on a slit lamp. Technique: Cornea is anesthetized and stained with fluorescein. Cornea and biprisms are illuminated with cobalt blue light. The prism touches the cornea, and the inner edges of two semicircles are adjusted to just touch. IOP is read by multiplying the dial reading by ten. Variable force tonometers: Goldmann applanation tonometer → Gold standard Perkins tonometer (hand held version of goldmann) Draeger tonometer (measures wide range of IOP) Draeger tonometer is similar to Perkins It has a different set of prisms It operates with a motor Pulsair (non-contact tonometer) Airpuff (non-contact tonometer) Grolman (non-contact tonometer) Tonopen (based on both indentation and applanation) (Option D) MacKay Marg (based on both indentation and applanation) Rebound tonometer Transpalpebral Tonometer Fixed force tonometer: Maklakov tonometer Barraquer tonometer Hertel’s exophthalmometer (Option A) is used to measure the degree of exophthalmos (protrusion of the eyeball) in conditions such as thyroid eye disease. Gonioscope (Option B) is a specialized lens used to visualize the iridocorneal angle, which is important in assessing angle-closure glaucoma.",

      "explanation": "Correct Answer: A) PG analogues Explanation: Treatment of glaucoma: There are 3 types of treatment modalities: Medical management Laser Surgery 1. Medical: The drugs either decrease the formation of aqueous or increase the drainage to decrease IOP. This is of 2 types: Topical (6 types) Systemic (2 types) Topical: PGF2 alpha agonist: It increases the uveoscleral outflow First line in glaucoma These are also contraindicated in uveitis and asthma For eg- Latanoprost, bimatoprost, travoprost , tafluprost, and unoprostone isopropyl Latanoprost causes heterochromia iridis Bimatoprost increases both uveoscleral and trabecular outflow Side effects: Hypertrichosis Beta-blockers These decrease the formation of aqueous Eg: Timolol, betaxolol C/I in asthma S/E: corneal anesthesia and blepharoconjunctivitis Alpha agonists: They have dual action i.e. they decrease the formation of aqueous and increase the trabecular outflow. Eg: Adrenaline/epinephrine, dipivefrin, brimonidine, and apraclonidine Brimonidine is safe in pregnancy Adrenaline is C/I in aphakic glaucoma Miotics: These increase the trabecular outflow and open the angle blockage Eg: Pilocarpine S/E of Pilocarpine: Pseudo myopia, retinal detachment, shallow anterior chamber, iris cysts Topical carbonic anhydrase inhibitors: These decrease the formation of aqueous Eg: dorzolamide and brinzolamide These are C/I in sulpha allergies Newer anti-glaucoma drugs: Netarsudil: this increases the contractile property of the trabecular meshwork, thus increasing the trabecular outflow and it also decreases the aqueous production. It is a Rho-kinase inhibitor S/E: vortex keratopathy Systemic: Carbonic anhydrase inhibitor For eg: acetazolamide , methazolamide S/E: Tingling and numbness, constipation, renal stones, and a bad metallic taste Hyperosmotic agents: These draw aqueous out of the eye For eg: I/V mannitol (C/I in heart disease), glycerol (C/I in diabetes), isosorbide, and urea 2. Laser : Laser trabeculoplasty can be done using argon laser (ALT), or Micropulse diode (MLT) and selective laser trabeculoplasty (SLT). 3. Surgery : Surgical treatment of POAG primarily consists of a fistulizing (filtration) surgery which provides a new channel for aqueous outflow and successfully controls the IOP . Trabeculectomy is the most frequently performed filtration surgery nowadays.
