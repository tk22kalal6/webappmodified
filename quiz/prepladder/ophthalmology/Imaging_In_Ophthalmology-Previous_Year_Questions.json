      "question": "A 6-year-old child presents with a refractive error of -2D in the right eye and +1D in the left eye. Fundus examination reveals normal visual acuity and retinal findings. What is the most likely diagnosis?",
      "options": {
        "A": "Myopia",
        "B": "Hyperopia",
        "C": "Anisometropia",
        "D": "Amblyopia"
      },
      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "the two eyes. In this case: Right Eye (RE): -2D (Total refractive power: 62D → 60 + 2D) Left Eye (LE): +1D (Total refractive power: 59D → 60 - 1D) Difference in refractive power = 62D - 59D = 3D, which is greater than 2.5D, making it clinically significant anisometropia. Anisometropia: is a term used when the dioptric power of both eyes is not the same, and is significant if > 2.5D difference. Myopia (Option A): Myopia (nearsightedness) is present in the right eye (-2D), but the left eye has hyperopia (+1D). The diagnosis should reflect the difference in refractive power rather than just the presence of myopia. Hyperopia (Option B): Hyperopia (farsightedness) is present in the left eye (+1D), but since the right eye has myopia, this case is best classified as anisometropia rather than simple hyperopia. Amblyopia (Option D): Amblyopia (lazy eye) can develop due to anisometropia if left untreated, but the question does not indicate decreased visual acuity. Therefore, anisometropia is the more accurate primary diagnosis at this stage. Reference: Parsons Diseases of the eye, 23rd Edition, Pg 78",

      "question": "A patient presents with right-sided field defects in both eyes, but central vision remains unaffected. What is the most likely diagnosis?",
      "options": {
        "A": "Homonymous Hemianopia with Macular Sparing",
        "B": "Heteronymous Hemianopia with Central Sparing",
        "C": "Optic Chiasm Lesion",
        "D": "Optic Tract Lesion"
      },
      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "this case, the patient has a right-sided field defect in both eyes, which suggests a lesion in the contralateral visual pathway, most likely in the right occipital lobe or along the visual tract. Macular Sparing: The macula (central vision) is often spared in cases of cortical lesions, such as those caused by a stroke in the Posterior Cerebral Artery (PCA) territory. The macula receives a dual blood supply from both the PCA and the Middle Cerebral Artery (MCA). If the PCA is affected (for example, in a PCA stroke), but collateral circulation from the MCA is maintained, the macular representation in the visual cortex can still receive enough blood supply to preserve central vision. This phenomenon explains macular sparing in cortical lesions Fig: Homonymous hemianopia with macular sparing.

        "C": "Retinal CT",

      },
      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: A) Fundus fluorescein angiography Explanation: Fundus fluorescein angiography: Principle: Based on the detection of fluorescent light emitted by fluorescein dye in circulation. Absorption & Emission Wavelengths: Irradiating light: 420–490 nm. Emitted fluorescence: 510–530 nm. Retinal pigments and red blood cells can absorb fluorescent light, masking deeper structures. Pigment migration allows visibility of deeper layers. Diagnostic uses: Diabetic Retinopathy: Reveals neovascularization, and assesses vascular tree integrity. Fundus Disorders: Identifies depth of pathological involvement. Optic Nerve Pathologies: Useful in detecting optic nerve issues such as papilloedema. Neovascularization of Iris: Detects leakage from iris vessels, an early sign of rubeosis.
