      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: C) Palpebral conjunctiva Explanation: The palpebral conjunctiva lines the inner surface of the eyelids, which start at lid margins and are attached to posterior tarsal plates; while the bulbar conjunctiva covers the anterior sclera, which is continuous with corneal epithelium at limbus. The conjunctiva is a transparent mucous membrane lining the inner eyelid surface and anterior globe, terminating at the corneoscleral limbus. Blood supply: Anterior ciliary and palpebral arteries Lymphatic drainage to the preauricular and submandibular nodes (similar to the eyelids). Function: Provides both passive and active immunity. Anatomical divisions include: Palpebral conjunctiva: Starts at the mucocutaneous junction of the lid margins and attaches firmly to the posterior tarsal plates, with vertically oriented blood vessels along the tarsus. Forniceal conjunctiva: Loose and redundant, allowing for eye movement. Bulbar conjunctiva: Covers the anterior sclera, merging with the corneal epithelium at the limbus . The radial ridges at the limbus form the palisades of Vogt , the likely reservoirs for corneal stem cells. The bulbar conjunctival stroma is loosely attached to the underlying Tenon’s capsule , except at the limbus where both layers fuse. Additional structures include the plica semilunaris (a semilunar fold on the nasal side) and the caruncle , a fleshy nodule containing modified cutaneous tissue, situated medially to the plica.",

      "question": "Which of the following structures do not contain any ganglion cells?",
      "options": {
        "A": "Macula",
        "B": "Fovea",
        "C": "Foveola",
        "D": "Periphery of the retina"
      },
      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: C) Foveola Explanation: The foveola is the central part of the fovea and is unique in that it lacks ganglion cells, which allows for optimal light entry, contributing to high visual acuity. The macula is a circular area measuring 5 to 5.5 mm in diameter, covering the central 15–20° of the visual field. It contains high concentrations of yellow carotenoid pigments, lutein and zeaxanthin, hence the name \"macula lutea\". The fovea , a depression located at the center of the macula, has a diameter of about 1.5 mm, similar to that of the optic disc. The foveola , forming the central floor of the fovea, measures 0.35 mm in diameter and is the thinnest part of the retina, containing only cone photoreceptors and Müller cells, with no ganglion cells. The umbo is the central depression of the foveola and is associated with the foveolar light reflex; its loss may signal early damage. The foveal avascular zone is a blood vessel-free area within the fovea but surrounded by capillaries, with an average diameter of 0.6 mm, which varies with age and disease and is best assessed via fluorescein angiography.

      "question": "Which of the following is the anteroposterior diameter of the adult human eyeball?",
      "options": {
        "A": "23 mm",
        "B": "23.5 mm",
        "C": "24 mm",
        "D": "75 mm"
      },
      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: C) 24 mm Explanation: Anteroposterior diameter of the adult human eyeball is 24 mm. Axes and angle kappa: The anatomical (pupillary) axis runs from the posterior pole of the eye through the center of the cornea, but it usually doesn’t align with the visual axis because the fovea is slightly temporal. The visual axis runs from the fovea through the eye's nodal point to the fixation point. In normal binocular single vision (BSV), the visual axes of both eyes meet at the fixation point, where images are aligned by the fusion reflex and combined by binocular cells in the visual cortex to produce BSV. Alpha angle ( I ) is the angle formed between the visual and optic axes. Angle kappa ( κ ) is the angle between the visual and anatomical axes. The fovea is normally located temporal to the anatomical center of the posterior pole, causing the eyes to slightly abduct for bifoveal fixation. A light on the cornea creates a reflex just nasal to the corneal center, known as a positive angle kappa. A large positive angle kappa (e.g. temporally displaced macula) may give a pseudoexotropia. A negative angle kappa occurs when the fovea is nasal to the posterior pole (e.g., high myopia ), causing a temporal corneal reflex that can simulate esotropia.

      "question": "Which structure primarily offers resistance to aqueous humor outflow within the iridocorneal angle?",
      "options": {
        "A": "Iris",

        "C": "Descemet's Membrane",
        "D": "Trabecular Meshwork"
      },
      "correct_answer": "D",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: D) Trabecular Meshwork Explanation: Angle of Anterior Chamber Angle of Anterior Chamber, found at the periphery of the anterior chamber, is bordered by the corneo sclera anteriorly and the iris root and ciliary body posteriorly. It houses the trabecular meshwork and the canal of Schlemm, both crucial for draining aqueous humor. Trabecular Meshwork: A triangular, loosely arranged tissue network between the anterior chamber and the canal of Schlemm. Its coarse (collagen and elastin) and fine (mucopolysaccharides) frameworks create resistance to aqueous flow. (Option D) Canal of Schlemm: A circular venous sinus within the sclera, crucial for draining aqueous humour The diagram above shows the outflow. The aqueous that is formed in the posterior chamber goes through the pupil into the anterior chamber, and through the trabecular pathway . When it passes through the uveosclera, it is called the uveoscleral pathway . Iris (Option A) does not play a significant role in regulating the aqueous humour outflow or offering resistance to its drainage. Ciliary body (Option B) produces aqueous humour but does not resist its outflow. Descemet's membrane (Option C) contributes to structural support, not resistance.",

      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: C) Superior ophthalmic vein to the cavernous sinus Explanation: The superior ophthalmic vein directly drains blood from the orbit into the cavernous sinus, providing a pathway for infections to enter the cranial cavity. This route is significant in cases of orbital infections, as it can lead to serious complications such as brain abscesses and cavernous sinus thrombosis. The venous drainage of the eye primarily occurs through: Superior ophthalmic vein: It receives drainage from the angular, supratrochlear, and supraorbital veins, superior vortex veins, anterior ethmoidal vein, and receives collateral drainage from the inferior ophthalmic vein. It continues posteriorly to drain into the cavernous sinus. Inferior ophthalmic vein: It originates from a plexus in the inferior orbit and collects blood from the inferior vortex veins. It eventually drains into the cavernous sinus. Reference: Myron Yanoff and Jay S. Duker, Ophthalmology, 5th Edition, Page 1268",

      },
      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: C) Oculomotor nerve palsy Explanation: The eye appears downward and abducted, commonly known as down and out pupil due to paralysis of the inferior oblique, and medial rectus muscles. There is ptosis of left eye (upper eyelid droop, due to denervation to the levator palpebrae superioris), and the pupil is dilated in the left eye (as the constrictor pupillae is denervated). These signs are suggestive of oculomotor nerve palsy (Left side). Nerves of the eye: Optic nerve (CN II) Purely sensory Senses the incoming light and image displayed on retina Oculomotor nerve (CN III) Innervates majority of the extraocular muscles Motor innervation to the superior rectus muscle, medial rectus muscle, inferior rectus muscle, inferior oblique muscle, levator palpebrae superioris muscle, ciliary muscle, and the sphincter muscle.

      },
      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: C) Sympathetic nerve fibers Explanation: Sympathetic nerve fibers are responsible for the dilation of the pupil (mydriasis). These fibers originate from the sympathetic chain and supply the dilator pupillae muscle, allowing the pupil to expand in response to low light conditions, thus enabling more light to enter the eye.
