      "question": "In a patient who has had contact with a COVID-19 patient, presenting with symptoms such as redness, sensitivity to light, excessive tearing, and overall discomfort, a thorough examination was conducted with no eye abnormality. Based on this information, which specific part of the eye is most likely to be affected in this patient?",

        "A": "Conjunctiva",
        "B": "Uvea",
        "C": "Choroid",

      },
      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "excessive tearing, and discomfort are characteristic of conjunctivitis, commonly known as pink eye. Conjunctivitis has been observed as a common ocular manifestation of COVID-19, with the conjunctiva being the most likely part of the eye to be affected. This is usually a mild viral conjunctivitis that resolves with symptomatic treatment. Incorrect Options: Uvea (Option B) is typically affected in uveitis. While uveitis can cause redness, sensitivity to light, and discomfort, it is less common to occur solely as a result of COVID-19. Also, uveitis typically presents with more severe signs upon examination, such as cells in the anterior chamber or posterior synechiae, which were not noted in this case. Choroid (Option C) is a deeper structure within the eye and is not typically affected in viral conjunctivitis or mild ocular manifestations of COVID-19. Choroiditis would present with more severe symptoms and would be visible on specialized imaging such as fluorescein angiography. Retina (Option D) would typically not be directly affected by COVID-19 or the symptoms presented in this patient. Retinal conditions, such as retinitis, often present with more severe visual changes, such as visual field defects or floaters, which were not reported here.

Instead, it grows between the layers of the cornea, causing distortion and irritation. Incorrect Options Option A - Abnormal activity of p53 is seen in the pterygium tissue: This statement is correct. Pterygium is associated with abnormal p53 expression, which is a tumor suppressor gene that plays a role in regulating cell growth and preventing the formation of tumors. Option B - Decreased activity of tissue inhibitors of metalloproteinases is seen: This statement is correct. Pterygium is associated with an imbalance in the activity of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) and tissue inhibitors of metalloproteinases (TIMPs), leading to excessive tissue remodeling. Option D - Elastotic degeneration and hyalinization of the connective tissue of the conjunctiva occur: This statement is correct. Pterygium is characterized by elastotic degeneration, which refers to the accumulation of abnormal elastic tissue, and hyalinization, which involves the deposition of a substance called hyaline, in the conjunctival tissue.",

Vernal keratoconjunctivitis (Spring catarrh): It is a recurrent bilateral conjunctivitis that tends to occur with the onset of warm weather. It primarily affects young children and adolescents, particularly boys. Type I & IV HSR reaction > Type IV HSR Course The condition typically starts in childhood and may resolve on its own over 5–10 years. Symptoms Burning, Itching, Photophobia (sensitivity to light), and lacrimation (excessive tearing). Signs Palpebral Form: Hypertrophied palpebral conjunctiva with a cobblestone appearance ; bluish-white color; dense fibrous tissue with thickened epithelium. Limbal or Bulbar Form: Opacification at the limbus, gelatinous thickening, and Horner–Trantas dots Pseudogerontoxon/cupid’s bow (which resembles arcus senilis) is a grayish-white ring at the limbus seen in severe limbal vernal keratoconjunctivitis (VKC). Shield ulcers are a significant complication of VKC, particularly in severe cases. These microerosions typically form on the upper third of the cornea. Mixed form: Exhibits characteristics of both the tarsal (palpebral) and limbal subtypes, typically presenting in only one eye. Maxwell Lyon's sign is a pseudomembrane formed due to excessive mucus deposition on the papilla resulting in cobblestone papillae. Histology In the palpebral form, hypertrophied papillae are observed, rich in eosinophils and other inflammatory cells.

Macular edema (Option B): Pterygium affects the cornea and conjunctiva, but it does not involve the retina or macula. Macular edema is seen in conditions like diabetic retinopathy or retinal vein occlusion. Purulent discharge (Option C): Pterygium is a non-infectious degenerative condition, so it does not cause purulent discharge. Discharge may be seen in bacterial conjunctivitis or dacryocystitis.

      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: B) Bitot’s spots Explanation: Causes for Vitamin A Deficiency : Decreased intake. Obstructive jaundice: Defective absorption. Liver cirrhosis: Reduce synthesis of RBP (retinol binding protein). Severe malnutrition: Lack of amino acids for RBP synthesis. Chronic nephrosis: RBP excretion through urine. Vitamin A Deficiency Manifestations : 1. Ocular manifestations : Vitamin A deficiency is the most significant preventable cause of blindness, especially in children below 5 in developing countries. Early Signs: Loss of sensitivity to green light. Difficulty adapting to dim light. Night blindness. Prolonged Deficiency: Xerophthalmia: Dry, thick, keratinized conjunctiva and cornea. If untreated, it leads to corneal ulceration and ultimately results in blindness due to the formation of opaque scar tissue. WHO grading of xerophthalmia: Bitot's Spots: Grayish-white triangular plaques firmly adherent to the conjunctiva. Keratomalacia: When xerophthalmia persists for a longer time, it progresses to keratomalacia (corneal softening). XN Night blindness. X1 X1A: Conjunctival xerosis. X1B: Bitot spots. (Option B) X2 Corneal xerosis. X3 X3A: Corneal ulceration, less than one-third. X3B: Corneal ulceration, more than one-third. XS Corneal scar. XF Xerophthalmic fundus. 2. Immune Function: Deficiency increases susceptibility to infections. Infection reduces retinol-binding protein synthesis, lowering vitamin A levels and impairing immune responses. 3. Skin and Mucous Membrane Lesions: Follicular Hyperkeratosis (Phrynoderma): Causes rough skin due to hyperkeratinization of the follicular epithelium. Keratinizing Metaplasia: Affects respiratory, gastrointestinal, and genitourinary tracts. Epithelium is atrophied. 4. Other General Manifestation : Growth retardation due to defective synthesis of chondroitin sulfate. Decreased protein synthesis. Incorrect Options: Pinguecula (Option A) is a degenerative conjunctival condition unrelated to Vitamin A deficiency. Pterygium (Option C) is a fibrovascular growth extending from the conjunctiva onto the cornea, often caused by UV exposure rather than nutritional deficiency. Stocker’s line (Option D) is an iron line seen in front of the advancing edge of a pterygium, also unrelated to Vitamin A deficiency. Reference: Harper Edition 32, Page no: 538.",

Mucormycosis (Option B) : This is a rare fungal infection that can occur in COVID-19 patients, particularly in those with diabetes or who are immunocompromised. It can cause serious orbital and sinus involvement, but it is not the most frequently observed eye symptom in COVID-19.
