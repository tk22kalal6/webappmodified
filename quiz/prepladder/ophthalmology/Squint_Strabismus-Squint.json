      "question": "A 7-year old child is brought to the clinic by her parents due to concerns about her right eyes appearing misaligned. On examination, her squint remains constant in all directions of gaze. She does not report any diplopia, and there are no limitations in eye movement. What is the most likely diagnosis?",

        "D": "Pseudo-strabismus"
      },
      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: A) Concomitant squint Explanation: The squint remains constant in all directions of gaze with no associated diplopia, suggesting that it is a case of concomitant squint. Squint/Strabismus: Misalignment of the visual axis. This condition is also called Heterotropia. Classification: It is divided into latent squint (phorias) and manifest (tropia). Latent squint - classification Hyperphoria Exophoria Esophoria Manifest squint - classification Esotropia/Exotropia/Hypertropia Concomitant/Incomitant squint Concomitant: Esotropia/Exotropia Incomitant: Paralytic (paralysis of the muscles) Restrictive squint (fibrosis of the muscles) A-V pattern or pattern squint Ocular motility defects Concomitant squint: It's a type of manifest squint in which the angle of deviation remains equal in all the 9 gazes ; there is no associated limitation of ocular movements (Option A) . Primary deviation is equal to secondary deviation . Primary deviation is the amount of deviation in a squinted eye. Secondary deviation: It is the amount of deviation in the normal eye (behind the cover). Concomitant squint commonly occurs during early childhood or can be congenital (congenital squint). Eye movements are normal and no double vision (diplopia). Amblyopia develops later (negative adaptation). Abnormal retinal correspondence also plays a role. It is a positive adaptation. Incomitant squint (Option B): This condition is just the opposite of concomitant squints, where the degree of squint varies in different aspects. Secondary deviation is higher than primary deviation in paralytic squint. In contrast to concomitant squints, there is a late presentation. There is palsy of other muscles, which causes limited ocular movements (ocular movements are restricted). Diplopia is also a very important feature of inconcomitant squints. Paralytic squint (Option C): Paralytic squint is a type of incomitant squint in which ocular deviation results from complete or incomplete paralysis of one or more extraocular muscles. History of diplopia and confusion Secondary deviation is greater than primary deviation. Ocular movements are restricted towards the action of paralyzed muscle. Head is turned towards the action of paralyzed muscle. Pseudo-strabismus (Option D): Pseudostrabismus is a condition when the eyes are well aligned but appear to be misaligned. Causes of Pseudo-esotropia: Epicanthal folds High myopia (high negative angle kappa) Causes of Pseudo-Exotropia: Telecanthus or hypertelorism High hypermetropia (high positive angle kappa) Reference: Yanoff & Duker Ophthalmology, 5th edition, Pages 1211, 1217",

        "D": "Left inferior oblique"
      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: B) Left superior oblique Explanation: The Park 3-step test is a diagnostic test used to identify which muscle is paretic in the case of an acquired hypertropia. It is designed for the diagnosis of a single paretic vertical muscle and is unreliable when there are multiple paretic muscles or in restrictive strabismus. Applying the Park 3-step test : Which eye is hypertropic? The left eye is hypertropic, meaning the affected muscle must be either: A depressor of the left eye ( superior oblique or inferior rectus ) An elevator of the right eye ( superior rectus or inferior oblique ) Does hypertropia increase in the right gaze? Yes, → This suggests a problem with the left superior oblique or the right superior rectus . Does hypertropia increase on the left or right head tilt? The question doesn't explicitly state this, but given the patient's right head tilt , it suggests a compensatory posture. In superior oblique palsy , the head tilts opposite the affected muscle to minimize diplopia. This means the actual hypertropia worsens with a left tilt , confirming left superior oblique palsy . Final Diagnosis: Left superior oblique palsy → Compensatory right head tilt .

      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: B) Suppression of right eye Explanation: If the patient only sees three green dots, it suggests suppression of the right eye, as the red lens over the right eye would normally allow them to see the red dot. The fact that only green dots are seen indicates that the right eye is not contributing to vision. WORTH’S FOUR DOT TEST Patient wears goggles with red lens in front of the right eye and green lens in front of the left eye, and views a box with 4 lights - one red, two green and one white. Results are interpreted as below: Normal binocular single vision (Option D) : Patient sees all the four lights in the absence of manifest squint (image A) . Abnormal retinal correspondence: Patient sees all four lights even in the presence of a manifest squint. Left eye suppression (Option C) : Patient sees only two red lights (Image B) .

      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: A) Esophoria Explanation: In the Maddox rod test, if the vertical red line (seen by the right eye) appears to the right of the white light, it suggests that the eyes are converging, which is indicative of esophoria . MADDOX ROD TEST Patient is asked to fixate on a point light in the centre of a Maddox tangent scale at a distance of 6 metres. A Maddox rod is placed in front of one eye with the axis of rod parallel to the axis of deviation. The Maddox rod converts the point source into a line. Thus, the patient will see a point light with one eye and a red line with the other. Due to dissimilar images of the two eyes, fusion is broken and heterophoria becomes manifest . Measure the Horizontal Deviation with Maddox rod test The red lines of the Maddox rod are placed horizontally in front of the right eye so that a vertical line is formed. The patient is then asked whether the white light is superimposed on the horizontal red line or not. Patient might see the light source right or left to the red line. If superimposed - normal . If the patient is seeing the red line to the left of point light: Exotropia or crossed diplopia (as image moves inwards, eye moves outwards). (Option B) If the patient is seeing the red line to the right of point light: Esotropia or uncrossed diplopia . (Option A) Measure the Vertical Deviation with Maddox rod test The red lines of the Maddox rod are placed vertically in front of the right eye so that a horizontal line is formed. The patient is then asked whether the white light is superimposed on the horizontal red line or not. Patient might see the point light source up or down to the horizontal line. If superimposed - normal/orthophoria . If the point light source is above the red line: right hyperphoria or left hypophoria . (Option C) If the point light source is below the red line: right hypophoria or left hyperphoria . (Option D)",

      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: C) Pseudo-Von Graefe Sign Explanation: Pseudo-Von Graefe Sign is due to aberrant regeneration of the third cranial nerve following a palsy. The co-contraction of the levator palpebrae superioris and inferior rectus muscles leads to eyelid retraction on downgaze , distinguishing it from other conditions. This Pseudo-Von Graefe Sign is not associated with pupil abnormalities, and the pupil typically remains unaffected. Von Graefe’s Sign (Option A) is seen in Graves’ disease , characterised by delayed descent of the upper eyelid during downgaze caused by restrictive orbitopathy affecting the eyelid. Hutchinson’s Pupil (Option B): Typically seen in uncal herniation , characterised by a unilateral dilated pupil that is unresponsive to light due to compression of the third cranial nerve, often associated with raised intracranial pressure. Marcus Gunn Jaw-Winking Phenomenon (Option D) involves ptosis that improves with jaw movement due to aberrant innervation between the trigeminal nerve (motor division for the jaw) and the levator palpebrae superioris.

Duane Retraction Syndrome (DRS) Feature Type I Type II Type III Abduction Limited Normal Limited Adduction Normal or mildly limited Limited Limited Globe Retraction Present on adduction Variable Present on adduction Palpebral Fissure on Adduction Narrows Slight change Narrows Palpebral Fissure on Abduction Widens No significant change Slight change Pathophysiology Absent CN VI; CN III innervates LR CN III innervates LR Co-contraction of LR and MR Type I is due to congenital absence or hypoplasia of the abducens nerve (CN VI) . The lateral rectus is instead innervated by branches of the oculomotor nerve (CN III) , causing co-contraction of the lateral and medial recti during adduction. Key Clinical Findings in DRS Type I: Eye fails to abduct normally On adduction, the eye retracts into the orbit Narrowing of the palpebral fissure due to globe retraction Widening of the palpebral fissure during attempted abduction Duane Retraction Syndrome Type II (Option B): Incorrect because it shows limited adduction with normal abduction, which is the reverse of this case. Duane Retraction Syndrome Type III (Option C): Incorrect as both abduction and adduction are limited , not just abduction. Sixth Cranial Nerve Palsy (Option D): Incorrect because, although there is limited abduction , there is no globe retraction or palpebral fissure change on adduction.

It requires the patient to interpret the position of lines projected onto their retina, and their perception is used to measure the angle of deviation. This contrasts with purely objective tests, which rely on direct measurements or observations without relying on the patient's subjective interpretation of visual stimuli. Maddox Rod Test: Procedure: The patient is positioned in front of a bright spot of light in a dark room. A Maddox rod, consisting of multiple red glass cylinders or a Maddox groove disc, is placed in a trial frame before one eye. Testing Horizontal Deviation: Cylinders Horizontal: The red line seen through the Maddox rod will be vertical. Observation: If there is no horizontal deviation ( orthophoria ), the bright spot of light will align with the vertical red line. Esophoria: The red line will appear to the right of the light (uncrossed diplopia). Exophoria: The red line will appear to the left of the light (crossed diplopia). Testing Vertical Deviation: Cylinders Vertical: The red line will be horizontal. Observation: If there is no vertical deviation, the red line will pass through the light. Hyperphoria: If the red line appears above or below the light, it indicates hyperphoria. The direction of the deviation helps identify whether the right or left eye is affected.

      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: B) Forced duction test Explanation: The forced duction test is the primary method used to determine whether an eye movement limitation is due to mechanical restriction or a paralytic condition. Mechanical Tests of Eye Movement Limitations: Mechanical tests help differentiate between eye movement limitations due to paralysis, paresis, or mechanical restriction. 1. Forced Duction Test: Purpose: To determine if a limitation in eye movement is due to mechanical restriction or nerve palsy. Procedure: Apply topical anaesthetic to the limbal conjunctiva. The patient is instructed to look in the direction of the movement being tested, and the maximum eye range is observed. Using toothed forceps to grasp the conjunctiva, the examiner holds the eye at the opposite limbus and attempts to rotate it as far as possible in the same direction. Interpretation: Positive Test: Resistance to movement indicates a mechanical restriction (e.g., dysthyroid orbitopathy, muscle entrapment). Negative Test: No resistance suggests a nerve palsy, as the eye can be moved freely. 2. Testing Oblique Muscles: To test the superior and inferior obliques. 3. Active Force Generation Test: To assess the strength of muscle contraction against resistance. Hess Screen Test (Option A) measures the degree of misalignment but does not differentiate between mechanical restriction and nerve palsy directly. Cover Test (Option C) is useful for detecting and measuring deviations but not for determining the cause of limited movement. Worth’s 4-Dot Test (Option D) assesses binocular vision and suppression but does not provide specific information about mechanical restrictions or nerve palsy.",

They also evaluate the ability of each eye to fixate on a target. Cover Test: Detects Tropias: Measures constant deviations of the visual axis. Procedure: Cover one eye with a paddle, thumb, or occluder. Observe the uncovered eye for movement: Nasal movement: Exotropia Temporal movement: Esotropia Upward movement: Hypotropia Downward movement: Hypertropia For young children, use small toys instead of bright lights. Quantify the deviation with the simultaneous prism and cover test by introducing a prism before one eye until movement stops. Repeat with the prism before the other eye. Uncover Test: Identifies latent deviations or tropias. Procedure: Cover one eye and then observe the covered eye when the cover is removed. If the eye reverts to fixation, it indicates a phoria or intermittent tropia . Alternate Cover Test: Detects phorias by dissociating the visual axes. Alternate covering each eye to maximize visual axis dissociation. Care must be taken to permit time for each eye to reside behind the cover (the cover must not be “fanned” before the eyes).

        "D": "All of the above"
      },
      "correct_answer": "D",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: D) All of the above Explanation: All of the above mechanisms are responsible for maintaining coordinated movement of both eyes and achieving binocular vision Mechanism of Binocular Vision Formation: Binocular vision relies on the precise coordination of extraocular muscles in both eyes, ensuring single, clear vision through complex neural mechanisms. Key components of this system include: Conjugate & Dysconjugate Movements (Option A) Synkinesis refers to the simultaneous movement of both eyes in the same direction, essential for maintaining binocular alignment. This is known as conjugate movement . Dysconjugate movements occur when the eyes move in opposite directions, such as during convergence (both eyes move inward) or divergence (both eyes move outward). Synergistic & Antagonistic Muscles (Option B) Synergistic muscles contract together to move both eyes in a specific direction. Eg: In Dextroversion (rightward gaze), the right lateral rectus and left medial rectus act as synergists. Antagonistic muscles are those that relax or are inhibited during these movements. Eg: In Dextroversion, the right medial rectus and left lateral rectus are antagonists. Yoke Muscles (Option C) Yoke muscles are pairs of synergistic muscles in each eye that work together to achieve coordinated eye movements. Eg: In the Rightward gaze, the right lateral rectus and left medial rectus are yoke muscles that contract together to move the eyes in the same direction. Neurological Control Hering's Law of Equal Innervation ensures that both eyes receive equal and simultaneous neural input to the synergistic (yoke) muscles during conjugate movements. Sherrington's Law of Reciprocal Innervation states that increased activation of a muscle is accompanied by decreased activation of its direct antagonist muscle. Ocular Motor Nuclei and Pathways The control of eye movements involves several brainstem nuclei, including the oculomotor (III) , trochlear (IV) , and abducens (VI) nuclei. These nuclei coordinate eye movements through neural pathways, such as the medial longitudinal fasciculus (MLF) , which connects various eye movement centres.

      "explanation": "Correct Answer: D) Fick's x-axis; Right Superior Rectus Explanation: The vertical movements of the eye occur with the x axis as the centre of rotation in primary position.

Axis Direction Movements Muscles Involved X-Axis (Horizontal) Runs horizontally from the outer corner to the inner corner.

      },
      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: C) Right Lateral Rectus Explanation: Given that the left eye fails to adduct and diplopia is more noticeable during right gaze, it suggests that the left medial rectus is not functioning properly. Hering’s Law of Equal Innervation would mean that the right lateral rectus (yoke muscle) should be balanced with the left medial rectus ( vs Sherrington’s law: This law about reciprocal innervation states that increased innervation and contraction of a muscle is automatically associated with reciprocal decrease in innervation and contraction of its antagonist). If the left medial rectus is weak or underacting, the corresponding yoke muscle, the right lateral rectus, might be compensating and thus appearing to overact. Yoke muscles are pairs of extraocular muscles, one in each eye, that work together to ensure coordinated eye movements in the same direction. These muscles function according to Hering's Law of Equal Innervation , which ensures that corresponding muscles in both eyes receive equal neural impulses for synchronised movement. The yoke muscle pairs facilitate various eye movements: Horizontal Gaze (Left or Right) : Leftward Gaze (Levoversion) : Left Lateral Rectus (abducts the left eye) Right Medial Rectus (adducts the right eye) Rightward Gaze (Dextroversion) : Right Lateral Rectus (abducts the right eye) Left Medial Rectus (adducts the left eye) Vertical Gaze (Up or Down) : Upward Gaze (Elevation) : Right and Left Superior Rectus (elevate the eyes) Right and Left Inferior Oblique (assist in elevation) Downward Gaze (Depression) : Right and Left Inferior Rectus (depress the eyes) Right and Left Superior Oblique (assist in depression) Inward Gaze (Convergence) : Both Medial Rectus muscles contract to bring the eyes inward (toward the nose) during near-vision tasks, such as reading.",
