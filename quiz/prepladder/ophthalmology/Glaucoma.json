      "question": "A 65-year-old female presents with acute onset pain, redness, and blurring of vision in the right eye. On examination, her intraocular pressure (IOP) is 48 mmHg, and there is a shallow anterior chamber with a hazy cornea. Slit-lamp examination reveals an intumescent, swollen lens with the iris pushed forward. Gonioscopy shows a closed angle. What is the most likely underlying mechanism for her glaucoma?",
      "options": {
        "A": "Obstruction of the trabecular meshwork by inflammatory cells",
        "B": "Forward displacement of the lens due to an abnormal zonular attachment",
        "C": "Disruption of aqueous humor flow due to posterior synechiae",
        "D": "Pupillary block caused by the swollen lens"
      },
      "correct_answer": "D",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: D) Pupillary block caused by the swollen lens Explanation: Lens-induced glaucoma is a type of secondary angle-closure glaucoma associated with a disorder of the lens. In this case, the enlarged lens prevents aqueous humor from flowing through the pupil into the anterior chamber, leading to a pupillary block. The iris is pushed forward, resulting in angle closure and increased intraocular pressure. Lens-induced glaucoma can be categorized into the following types: Lens-induced secondary angle-closure glaucoma : Phacomorphic glaucoma: Caused by a swollen or intumescent lens. Phacotopic glaucoma: Due to anterior displacement of the lens. Lens-induced secondary open-angle glaucoma : Phacolytic glaucoma: Results from leakage of lens proteins. Lens particle glaucoma: Triggered by lens fragments in the anterior chamber. Phacoanaphylactic glaucoma: Caused by an immune response to lens proteins. Other options describe mechanisms for other forms of secondary glaucoma, such as uveitic glaucoma (Option A), phacodonesis (Option B), or chronic iritis ( Option C) , but are not characteristic of lens-induced glaucoma.

      "question": "A 6-month-old infant with congenital glaucoma has corneal enlargement, clouding, and Haab’s striae and the angle is difficult to visualize due to corneal clouding. Which surgical procedure is most appropriate for this infant?",
      "options": {
        "A": "Goniotomy",
        "B": "Trabeculotomy with Trabeculectomy",
        "C": "Trabeculectomy with antimetabolites",
        "D": "Glaucoma drainage devices"
      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: B) Trabeculotomy with Trabeculectomy Explanation: Congenital glaucoma is diagnosed in this infant based on corneal enlargement , clouding , Haab’s striae , and elevated intraocular pressure. When corneal clouding prevents proper angle visualization, Trabeculotomy with Trabeculectomy becomes the procedure of choice. Trabeculotomy helps expose Schlemm's canal to improve aqueous outflow, and trabeculectomy provides additional filtration, offering better intraocular pressure control. This combined approach is effective when angle visualization is not possible and helps manage congenital glaucoma in infants. Medical Treatment: Purpose : Used to lower intraocular pressure (IOP) until surgery can be performed. Medications : Hyperosmotic agents: Reduce IOP by drawing fluid out of the eye. Carbonic anhydrase inhibitors: Decrease fluid production. Beta-blockers (e.g., timolol 0.5%): Often the first choice for IOP reduction. Avoid : Miotics: Can paradoxically increase IOP. Alpha-2 agonists (e.g., brimonidine): Contraindicated in children due to CNS depression. Surgical Procedures: Incisional Angle Surgery : Goniotomy : Involves an incision in the angle of the eye using a Barkan’s goniotomy knife, performed under gonioscopic control. Success rate is around 85%. Interestingly, angle surgery is most successful in patients presenting between 2 months and 1 year of age (infantile-onset PCG) with 90% success, and less in newborn or late-recognized PCG with <50% success. In general, IOP control is obtained in greater than 80% of patients. Trabeculotomy : Used when corneal clouding prevents visualization or if goniotomy fails. Involves exposing Schlemm’s canal and breaking the inner wall with a trabeculotome. Filtration Surgery : Trabeculectomy with antimetabolites : Often provides good results. Combined trabeculotomy and trabeculectomy with antimetabolites : Considered a standard procedure for better outcomes. Glaucoma Drainage Devices (GDD) : Used in severe, resistant cases where other methods have failed. Goniotomy (Option A) involves making an incision in the angle of the eye and is best suited when the angle can be visualized clearly. Trabeculectomy with antimetabolites (Option C): While this is a common and effective procedure for many glaucoma cases, it might not be the first choice in this scenario due to the presence of corneal clouding and difficulty in initial angle procedures. Glaucoma Drainage Devices (Option D) are typically reserved for severe, resistant cases when other surgical methods have failed. They are not the first-line approach for the scenario described but might be considered if other surgical options are unsuccessful.",

        "C": "True Congenital Glaucoma",
        "D": "Secondary Congenital Glaucoma"
      },
      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: C) True Congenital Glaucoma Explanation: True Congenital Glaucoma is characterized by elevated intraocular pressure present during intrauterine life, resulting in ocular enlargement at birth . The presence of Haab’s striae, early onset, enlarged corneas, and the classic triad of symptoms (watering, photophobia, and blepharospasm) are all consistent with newborn glaucoma. Primary Congenital Glaucoma Types 1. Newborn glaucoma/ True congenital glaucoma : Elevated intraocular pressure is present during intrauterine life, resulting in ocular enlargement at birth . (40% cases) (Option C) Typically presents within the first month of life. Often associated with developmental anomalies of the anterior segment, such as primary congenital glaucoma, which can result from genetic mutations or other congenital conditions. 2. Infantile: ≤ 3 yrs of age - (Option B ruled out) Infantile glaucoma is labelled when the disease manifests prior to the child's third birthday Affects infants older than 1 month and children up to 3 years. Can also result from genetic factors or be secondary to other conditions like Sturge-Weber syndrome or other syndromic associations. 3. Juvenile: > 3 yrs of age (Option A ruled out) who develop pressure rise after 3 years but before adulthood. Also known as Juvenile primary open angle glaucoma(POAG) usually occurs between 10 to 35 years of age. Buphthalmos , meaning \"bull-like eyes,\" is a condition characterized by the enlargement of the eyeball. It typically manifests before the age of 3 years and results from the accumulation and retention of aqueous humor. Pathogenesis Trabeculodysgenesis: Maldevelopment of the trabeculum and iridotrabecular junction from neural crest cells impairs aqueous outflow, causing elevated IOP. Angle Recess Absence: The angle recess is absent, with the iris inserting either flatly or concavely into the trabeculum. Iris Insertion Types: Flat Insertion: Reveals the ciliary body and scleral spur. Concave Insertion: Obscures the scleral spur and ciliary body. Clinical Features Classic Triad: Lacrimation, photophobia, and blepharospasm; often accompanied by eye rubbing. Corneal Signs: Oedema: Early sign, may progress to permanent opacity. Enlargement: Corneal diameter >13 mm confirms enlargement; >16 mm indicates poor prognosis. Haab’s Striae: Tears in Descemet's membrane, visible as opaque lines. Additional Features: Thin Sclera: Appears blue due to underlying uveal tissue. Deep Anterior Chamber: Indicates elevated IOP. Iris Changes: Iridodonesis and atrophic patches in late stages. Lens Changes: Becomes flat and may subluxate. Optic",

      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: B) Deep Sclerectomy Explanation: In penetrating surgeries an incision is made to create a new drainage pathway, while non-penetrating surgeries aim to enhance the eye’s natural drainage mechanism without incisions. Penetrating surgeries Involves making incisions or creating openings that penetrate the eye's interior to establish a new drainage pathway for aqueous humor. Trabeculectomy is a classic example of a penetrating surgery; Involves resecting the trabecular meshwork and creating a fistula between the anterior chamber and the sub-conjunctival space. A partial-thickness V-shaped scleral incision is made to expose the trabecular meshwork, which is removed using Kelly's punch. An iridectomy is performed to prevent pupillary block. The scleral flap is repositioned and loosely sutured to allow controlled leakage of aqueous humor. A conjunctival flap covers the area, with the presence of a bleb indicating a successful procedure. Non-penetrating surgeries Aim to improve the eye’s natural drainage system without making a fistula. Examples include procedures like deep sclerectomy or viscocanalostomy. They enhance the outflow of aqueous humor by modifying or removing parts of the trabecular meshwork and adjacent structures but do not involve creating a direct drainage pathway through the eye wall. Penetrating surgeries: Trabeculectomy: (Option A) A fistula is created between the anterior chamber and sub tenon's space MCC of failure: fibrosis of fistula To prevent fibrosis , use antimetabolites( mitomycin, 5-FU) The trabecular meshwork is bypassed They have less chance of postoperative complications Glaucoma drainage device / seton surgery: (Option D) It is done in refractory cases , uncontrolled glaucoma and glaucoma with aniridia. Express Implant / Express mini shunt is a modification of trabeculectomy where a needle is used (made up of titanium) instead of a punch. No peripheral iridotomy is done.

      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "angle closure glaucoma Correct Answer: B) Selective laser trabeculoplasty for open-angle glaucoma and laser iridotomy for angle closure glaucoma Explanation: Selective Laser Trabeculoplasty (SLT) It is commonly used for open-angle glaucoma. SLT improves aqueous humor outflow by targeting the trabecular meshwork, which helps lower intraocular pressure over time. Laser trabeculoplasty : There are 2 types: a) Argon Laser trabeculoplasty b) Selective Laser trabeculoplasty- Laser applied selectively to pigmented trabecular meshwork Mechanism of action of argon and Nd: YAG laser is photocoagulation It increases fibrosis in one part, leading to contraction of that area, which then pulls the mesh, leading to the opening of the mesh to the other side. Selective Laser trabeculoplasty is the treatment of choice for prophylaxis in the other eye Laser Iridotomy It is used for angle closure glaucoma. This procedure creates a small hole in the peripheral iris to allow better fluid drainage and relieve the blockage of the anterior chamber angle. This helps lower intraocular pressure and prevent further episodes of angle closure. Argon laser iridotomy (Option A) is used for angle closure glaucoma, not open-angle glaucoma. Also, SLT is not typically used for angle closure glaucoma. Laser iridoplasty (Option C) is used for some cases of angle closure glaucoma, particularly when the angle is very narrow or if iridotomy is not feasible. However, argon laser iridotomy is the more common procedure for angle closure glaucoma. Laser iridoplasty is not used for open-angle glaucoma. Laser iridotomy (Option D) is not used for open-angle glaucoma; it is used for angle-closure glaucoma. Similarly, laser iridoplasty is a treatment for angle closure glaucoma, not open-angle glaucoma.

      "explanation": "Correct Answer: C) Acetazolamide Explanation: Treatment of glaucoma: There are 3 types of treatment modalities: Medical management Laser Surgery 1. Medical: The drugs either decrease the formation of aqueous or increase the drainage to decrease IOP. This is of 2 types: Topical (6 types) Systemic (2 types) Topical: Beta-blockers These decrease the formation of aqueous Eg: Timolol, betaxolol C/I in asthma S/E: corneal anesthesia and blepharoconjunctivitis Alpha agonists: They have dual action i.e. they decrease the formation of aqueous and increase the trabecular outflow. Eg: Adrenaline/epinephrine, dipivefrin, brimonidine, and apraclonidine Brimonidine is safe in pregnancy Adrenaline is C/I in aphakic glaucoma Miotics: These increase the trabecular outflow and open the angle blockage Eg: Pilocarpine (Option B) S/E of Pilocarpine: Pseudo myopia, retinal detachment, shallow anterior chamber, iris cysts Topical carbonic anhydrase inhibitors: These decrease the formation of aqueous Eg: dorzolamide and brinzolamide These are C/I in sulpha allergies Newer anti-glaucoma drugs: Netarsudil: this increases the contractile property of the trabecular meshwork, thus increasing the trabecular outflow and it also decreases the aqueous production. It is a Rho-kinase inhibitor S/E: vortex keratopathy PGF2 alpha agonist: It increases the uveoscleral outflow These are also contraindicated in uveitis and asthma For eg- Latanoprost, bimatoprost, travoprost (Option A) , tafluprost, and unoprostone isopropyl (Option D) Latanoprost causes heterochromia iridis Bimatoprost increases both uveoscleral and trabecular outflow Side effects: Hypertrichosis Systemic: Carbonic anhydrase inhibitor For eg: acetazolamide(Option C) , methazolamide S/E: Tingling and numbness, constipation, renal stones, and a bad metallic taste Hyperosmotic agents: These draw aqueous out of the eye For eg: I/V mannitol (C/I in heart disease), glycerol (C/I in diabetes), isosorbide, and urea 2. Laser : Laser trabeculoplasty can be done using argon laser (ALT), or Micropulse diode (MLT) and selective laser trabeculoplasty (SLT). 3. Surgery : Surgical treatment of POAG primarily consists of a fistulizing (filtration) surgery which provides a new channel for aqueous outflow and successfully controls the IOP . Trabeculectomy is the most frequently performed filtration surgery nowadays.

It is characterized by the presence of pigmented nodular lesions on the iris, which can be diffuse or localized. These pigmented lesions are a key feature that helps distinguish it from other ICE syndromes. Glaucomas Associated with Iridocorneal Endothelial (ICE) Syndromes: ICE Syndromes Include : Progressive iris atrophy Chandler's syndrome Cogan-Reese syndrome Pathogenesis : Abnormal corneal endothelial cells proliferate to form a membrane at the angle of the anterior chamber. Glaucoma is caused by secondary synechial angle closure due to contraction of this endothelial membrane. Clinical Features : Typically affects middle-aged women . Raised intraocular pressure (IOP) associated with specific features of the causative condition: Progressive iris atrophy : Iris shows corectopia, atrophy, and hole formation. (Options A & D ruled out) Chandler's syndrome : Mild or no iris changes, corneal edema predominates, even at normal IOP. (Option B ruled out) Cogan-Reese syndrome : Iris has pigmented nodular or diffuse lesions (also called iris nevus syndrome), and may have corneal changes. (Option C) Treatment : Glaucoma drainage device (artificial filtration shunt) may help control IOP. Medical treatment is often ineffective . Trabeculectomy surgery usually fails.

The treatment involves controlling IOP with anti-glaucoma medications, followed by steroid therapy to manage the uveitis. Glaucoma Associated with Uveitis Types: 1. Secondary Angle-closure glaucoma with a pupillary block (Option A): Caused by pupillary block due to annular synechiae, leading to iris bombe and subsequent angle closure. 2. Secondary Angle-closure glaucoma without a pupillary block (Option B) : Results from inflammatory debris organizing in the angle, which pulls the iris over the trabecular meshwork, causing progressive angle closure and elevated IOP. 3. Open-angle glaucoma (Option C) : This is caused by the blocking/inflammation of the trabecular meshwork by aqueous cells. 4. Specific Hypertensive Uveitis Syndromes: Glaucomatocyclitic crisis Uveitis with Open-Angle Glaucoma (Glaucomatocyclitic Crisis) It is called glaucomatocyclitic crisis or PSS (Posner-Schlossman Syndrome) or hypertensive uveitis (There is high intraocular pressure). The glaucoma is out of proportion to the minimal inflammation present. The condition is characterized by acute, recurrent episodes that resolve within days to weeks. Recurrence is common. Etiology: It is commonly seen in young males. This can be due to HLA-BW54 association has been documented. CMV or H. Pylori infection.

      "explanation": "Correct Answer: C) Atropine drops and oral acetazolamide Explanation: The clinical scenario describes a 70-year-old patient who, following trabeculectomy , experiences severe eye pain and blurred vision, elevated intraocular pressure (IOP), a shallow anterior chamber, a negative Seidel's test, which are characteristic of ciliary block glaucoma (malignant glaucoma). This condition occurs due to a mechanical blockage of aqueous humor flow, often after intraocular surgery. Initial Treatment for Malignant Glaucoma: Atropine Drops: These are used to dilate the ciliary ring and alleviate the ciliary block causing the increased IOP and shallow anterior chamber. Oral Acetazolamide: This carbonic anhydrase inhibitor helps reduce aqueous humor production, which is crucial for managing the elevated IOP in ciliary block glaucoma. Ciliary Block Glaucoma (Malignant Glaucoma/ Aqueous misdirection syndrome) A rare form of glaucoma that may occur as a complication of intraocular surgery. Characterized by markedly raised intraocular pressure (IOP) and a shallow or absent anterior chamber. Causes Post-surgical Complication: Common after peripheral iridectomy (Option D ruled out) , trabeculectomy, cataract surgery, capsulotomy, and laser iridotomy. Mechanism Cilio-Lenticular Block: In phakic eyes, the ciliary processes rotate forward and press against the lens. Cilio-IOL Block: In pseudophakic eyes, the ciliary processes press against the intraocular lens. Cilio-Vitreal Block: In aphakic eyes, the ciliary processes press against the anterior hyaloid face of the vitreous. Outcome: Blocks forward flow of aqueous humor, causing aqueous pockets to form in the vitreous, pushing the iris-lens diaphragm forward, increasing IOP, and flattening the anterior chamber. Clinical Features Symptoms: Severe pain and blurred vision post-intraocular surgery. Signs: Persistent shallow anterior chamber following surgery. Markedly raised IOP in the early postoperative period.

      "explanation": "Correct Answer: B) Panretinal photocoagulation Explanation: Based on these findings, the diagnosis of neovascular glaucoma is supported by the presence of iris neovascularization and elevated IOP in the context of proliferative diabetic retinopathy. Panretinal photocoagulation is the most appropriate treatment as it targets the underlying cause of neovascular glaucoma. This treats the retinal ischemia, reducing the stimulus for abnormal blood vessel growth and neovascularization. Neovascular Glaucoma (NVG) NVG is a severe type of glaucoma caused by neovascularization (abnormal blood vessel growth) in the iris and anterior chamber angle of the eye. Causes : Common : Proliferative diabetic retinopathy Central retinal vein occlusion Sickle-cell retinopathy Eales' disease Rare : Chronic intraocular inflammation Intraocular tumors Long-standing retinal detachment Central retinal artery occlusion Mechanism : Neovascularization (rubeosis iridis) on the iris leads to fibrosis. Results in zip-like adhesions of the iris to the cornea at the angle. Stages : Pre-glaucomatous Stage : Presence of rubeosis iridis (neovascularization of the iris). Open-Angle Glaucoma Stage : Formation of a pretrabecular neovascular membrane, leading to increased intraocular pressure (IOP). Secondary Angle Closure Glaucoma Stage : Neovascular membrane causes goniosynechiae (adhesions) leading to angle closure. Treatment : Panretinal Photocoagulation or Cryotherapy : Aimed at preventing further neovascularization. Anti-VEGF Agents : Used as an adjunctive treatment . Help reduce neovascularization. (Option D) Medical Therapy : Often ineffective for controlling IOP. Trabeculectomy : A surgical procedure to lower intraocular pressure, often combined with antifibroblastic agents. Glaucoma Drainage Device : Artificial filtration shunt (Seton operation) can help manage IOP. Topical beta-blockers and oral carbonic anhydrase inhibitors (Option A): These medications can help manage intraocular pressure (IOP) but do not address the underlying cause of neovascular glaucoma, which is the retinal ischemia and resulting neovascularization. Systemic corticosteroids (Option C): While corticosteroids can reduce inflammation, they do not address neovascularization or the elevated IOP associated with neovascular glaucoma.

      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: B) Zonular instability and phacodonesis. Explanation: Zonular instability is a hallmark of pseudoexfoliation syndrome , where the accumulation of pseudoexfoliative material weakens the zonular fibers. This can lead to phacodonesis (lens wobbling). Ocular manifestation of Pseudoexfoliation Syndrome (XFS) is characterized by the accumulation of fibrillar, proteinaceous material on various ocular structures, including the lens, iris, and trabecular meshwork. This material can be seen as flaky white deposits on the anterior lens capsule and pupillary margin, often with a distinct clear zone at the center of the lens. It causes secondary open-angle glaucoma, known as pseudoexfoliative glaucoma. The excessive material and pigment clog the trabecular meshwork, increasing intraocular pressure (IOP) and causing damage to the optic nerve, which leads to glaucoma. It also predisposes patients to complications during cataract surgery due to weakened zonules, resulting in lens instability or phacodonesis. Features of Pseudoexfoliation Syndrome: White flaky deposits on the anterior lens capsule and iris Increased trabecular meshwork pigmentation Elevated IOP, leading to secondary glaucoma Zonular instability and risk of lens dislocation during cataract surgery Mutations in the LOXL1 gene have been strongly associated with PXF, although not all individuals with these mutations develop the disease. More prevalent in elderly patients. Posterior synechiae (Option A) is incorrect because while inflammation can lead to synechiae, it is not a primary feature of pseudoexfoliation syndrome. Corneal guttata (Option C) is associated with Fuchs' endothelial dystrophy, not pseudoexfoliation syndrome. Iris heterochromia (Option D) is typically seen in Fuchs' heterochromic iridocyclitis, not pseudoexfoliation syndrome.

        "D": "Argon laser peripheral iridoplasty"
      },
      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: C) Topical prostaglandin analogue Explanation: This patient's presentation is consistent with pigmentary glaucoma. The key features are: 1. Young, myopic male 2. Elevated IOP 3. Krukenberg spindle (vertical line of pigment on corneal endothelium) 4. Heavily pigmented trabecular meshwork 5. Iris transillumination defects 6. Symptoms exacerbated by exercise (due to pupillary movement causing increased pigment release) Pigmentary glaucoma: Pigmentary glaucoma is a form of secondary open-angle glaucoma characterized by clogging up of the trabecular meshwork caused by the pigment particles. Pigment release may be caused by mechanical rubbing of the posterior pigment layer of the iris with the zonular fibrils. It is more common in young, myopic males. Pigment granules are deposited in anterior segment structures, including the iris, the posterior surface of the cornea ( Krukenberg’s spindle ), the trabecular meshwork, ciliary zonules, and the crystalline lens. On gonioscopy, pigment is seen accumulating along Schwalbe’s line , particularly in the inferior region ( Sampaolesi's line ). Iris transillumination reveals radial, slit-like defects in the mid-periphery, which is a characteristic feature. Treatment is along the lines of POAG management, which initially includes medical treatment, with prostaglandin analogues often being the first choice due to their IOP-lowering efficacy and convenient dosing schedule. (Option C) Nd:YAG laser peripheral iridotomy (Option A) is not the first-line treatment. It is generally reserved for cases with pronounced iris concavity or those not responding to medical therapy. Selective laser trabeculoplasty (SLT) (Option B) is typically considered after initial medical therapy or in combination with it.

      "explanation": "Correct Answer: B) Pigment dispersion syndrome Explanation: Pigment dispersion syndrome occurs when pigment granules from the iris epithelium are released into the anterior chamber and deposit on various structures, including the corneal endothelium and trabecular meshwork. This can lead to trabecular outflow obstruction and subsequent glaucoma. Symmetric Iris transillumination defects in the mid-peripheral iris, is characteristic of Pigment Dispersion Syndrome (PDS) . Secondary Glaucoma: Secondary glaucoma refers to elevated intraocular pressure resulting from an identifiable ocular or systemic disorder.

      },
      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: C) Cyclodestructive procedure Explanation: Absolute glaucoma is the final phase of Primary Angle Closure Glaucoma. Clinical features of Absolute Glaucoma are: Painful blind eye. A ciliary flush around the cornea due to dilated ciliary veins, and in long-standing cases, caput medusae with prominent vessels. Cornea - initially clear but insensitive, later becoming hazy, with epithelial bullae (bullous keratopathy) or filaments (filamentary keratitis). Anterior chamber - very shallow. Iris - atrophic. Pupil - fixed and dilated. Optic disc - glaucomatous optic atrophy. IOP is high and the eyeball becomes stony hard. Management of absolute glaucoma In absolute glaucoma, the goal of treatment is to relieve pain and reduce IOP, as vision cannot be restored. Retrobulbar alcohol injection - given to relieve pain. First, 1 mL of 2% xylocaine is injected followed after about 5-10 minutes by 1 mL of 80% alcohol. It suppresses the ciliary ganglion. A cyclodestructive procedure, such as cyclocryotherapy or cyclophotocoagulation, is the most appropriate management option in this scenario as it reduces aqueous production by damaging the secretory ciliary processes aiming to reduce IOP. (Option C) If pain persists despite cyclodestruction, enucleation/ evisceration may be considered. (Option D) Topical timolol and brimonidine (Option A) are incorrect because medical management with topical medications is insufficient for absolute glaucoma. Trabeculectomy (Option B) is incorrect because filtration surgery is not indicated in absolute glaucoma. The eye is already blind, and there is a high risk of complications such as hypotony, choroidal effusion, or suprachoroidal hemorrhage in eyes with such advanced disease.

      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: B) It is more commonly seen in older patients with primary angle closure glaucoma glaucoma, not older patients. Plateau Iris Configuration Anatomy Plateau iris is characterized by an anteriorly positioned ciliary body, which pushes the peripheral iris forward. This creates a \"table-top\" or plateau-like appearance of the iris. Age of presentation It is more commonly seen in younger patients with primary angle closure glaucoma. This is in contrast to the pupillary block, which is more common in older individuals. Diagnostic tools Ultrasound biomicroscopy (UBM) is particularly useful in diagnosing plateau iris configuration. (Option D) Management Due to its persistence after iridotomy, patients with plateau iris may require additional treatments such as: (Option C) Argon laser peripheral iridoplasty Long-term use of miotic drops iris configuration\" data-author=\"Imrankabirhossain \" data-hash=\"1779\" data-license=\"CC BY-SA 4.0 \" data-source=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plateau_iris#/media/File:Plateau_iris.jpg\" data-tags=\"March2025\" src=\"https://image.prepladder.com/notes/kNo6RgS1IhBIs2w2tJFH1742972082.png\" /> Reference: Pubmed Kanski Clinical Ophthalmology, 10th edition, Pages 375, 376, 377",
