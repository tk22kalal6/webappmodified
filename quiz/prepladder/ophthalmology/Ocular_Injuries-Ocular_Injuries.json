      "question": "A patient presents with a full-thickness corneal wound caused by a nail. Which of the following is the most likely complication if the injury is left untreated?",
      "options": {
        "A": "Ring abscess of the cornea",
        "B": "Retinal detachment",
        "C": "Glaucoma",
        "D": "Strabismus"
      },
      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: A) Ring abscess of the cornea Explanation: Untreated penetrating injuries can introduce microorganisms, leading to severe infections like a ring abscess of the cornea, a sight-threatening condition. Penetrating Eye Injury Definition A penetrating injury enters the eye without exiting, resulting in no exit wound. Causes Sharp objects such as sharpened pencils (most common cause in children) , needles, knives, nails, screws, glass, etc. Damage Mechanisms Tearing and structural disruption Pathogens enter through open wounds, leading to ring abscesses , corneal sloughing, iridocyclitis, endophthalmitis, panophthalmitis, etc. (Option A) Prognosis It depends on the severity of the injury and the complications that arise secondary to the injury. Influenced by: Initial visual acuity Presence of a relative pupillary defect (RAPD) Presence of an intraocular foreign body Presence of infection Presence of a retinal injury or detachment. Retinal detachment (Option B) is more commonly associated with blunt trauma rather than penetrating injuries. Glaucoma (Option C ) is a potential late complication but not the immediate concern in this scenario. Strabismus (Option D) refers to eye misalignment, which arises from muscle or nerve dysfunction, not corneal trauma.",

      "question": "A 40-year-old construction worker presents with eye pain and blurred vision after metal struck his eye. CT scan reveals an intraocular foreign body lodged in the vitreous cavity. What is the most appropriate treatment?",
      "options": {
        "A": "Observation and follow-up in one week",
        "B": "Corticosteroid injection without IOFB removal",
        "C": "Immediate surgery with pars plana vitrectomy and IOFB removal",
        "D": "Application of topical antibiotics and patching"
      },
      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: C) Immediate surgery with pars plana vitrectomy and IOFB removal Explanation: Pars plana vitrectomy with IOFB removal is essential to prevent complications and preserve vision, and it is ideally done during the initial closure. Intraocular Foreign Bodies (IOFBs) Description An IOFB can lodge in any part of the anterior or posterior segments, causing mechanical damage, infection, or toxic effects on intraocular structures. Types Inert: Glass, wood, plastic, rubber, gold, silver, platinum Reactive: Organic and Inorganic (iron causing siderosis, copper causing chalcosis). Diagnosis History. Examination (wound examination, foreign body location, associated signs such as lid laceration and anterior segment damage should be noted). CT (investigation of choice) with axial and coronal cuts detects and localizes a metallic IOFB. MRI is contraindicated (metallic IOFB). Treatment Magnetic removal (metallic IOFB) Forceps removal through pars plana vitrectomy (Option C) Prophylaxis against infection ( topical/systemic antibiotics ) (Option D ruled out) Conservative and supportive management ( topical corticosteroids , analgesics, etc). (Option B ruled out) Observation and follow-up in a week (Option A) in the presence of a foreign body in the vitreous cavity could lead to infection and further complications.

      "question": "A 28-year-old metalworker presents with gradual vision loss and a history of a metallic foreign body injury 4 months ago. Examination reveals iron deposits on Iris, rusty deposits on the lens and pigmentary changes in the retina. What is the most likely cause of his condition?",
      "options": {
        "A": "Chalcosis",
        "B": "Retinitis pigmentosa",
        "C": "Siderosis bulbi",
        "D": "Glaucoma"
      },
      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: C) Siderosis bulbi Explanation: Siderosis Bulbi Definition Degenerative eye condition caused by an iron-containing foreign body that is not promptly removed from the eye. (Option C) Cause Chisel and hammer injury (most common cause) Mechanism Oxidation and other chemical reactions with surrounding tissues, leading to toxic effects on cellular enzyme systems and subsequent cell death. Clinical Manifestations Lens deposits (radially distributed iron deposits on the anterior lens capsule leading to cataract) Heterochromia iridis (iris pigmentation): Reddish-brown staining of the iris. Retinal changes (pigmentary retinopathy), leading to atrophy of the retina and RPE (retinal pigment epithelium), potentially leading to profound visual loss. Glaucoma (trabecular damage) Electroretinography (ERG): Progressive attenuation of the b-wave over time. Chalcosis (Option A) is caused by copper, not iron, and shows distinct features like Kayser-Fleischer rings. Retinitis pigmentosa (Option B) is genetic, not due to trauma. Glaucoma (Option D) can be a complication but is not the primary diagnosis here.",

      "question": "A 35-year-old male presents to the emergency department after an accidental chemical exposure to his eyes while working in a lab. He reports immediate burning and decreased vision. Upon examination, there is corneal epithelial loss and conjunctival swelling. What is the most appropriate immediate management step?",
      "options": {
        "A": "Necrotic tissue removal and administer topical antibiotics",
        "B": "Apply corticosteroids to reduce inflammation",
        "C": "Immediate irrigation with water or saline for 20-30 minutes",
        "D": "Perform corneal transplant"
      },
      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: C) Immediate irrigation with water or saline for 20-30 minutes Explanation: Irrigation with water or saline is the priority to dilute and remove the chemical, minimizing damage. Chemical Injuries Description Chemical eye injuries are caused by acidic or alkaline substances entering the eye (accidental or due to assault), presenting a severe ocular emergency that demands immediate treatment. Cause Alkali burn (most common, more severe) Ammonia (most common), NaOH (sodium hydroxide), lime [CaO]. Acid (coagulates the surface proteins) Hydrofluoric acid (used in glass etching), sulphuric acid Others : Detergents, cosmetics, fertilizers, insecticides, etc. Pathophysiology Management Immediate management: The first and the most crucial step while treating a chemical injury is copious irrigation ( water or saline for at least 20-30 minutes or until the eye’s pH is restored ) by double eversion of the lid. (Option C) Debridement: Carefully excise dead conjunctiva and corneal epithelium using a cotton swab. (Option A ruled out) Medical management: Antibiotics (Option A ruled out) Cycloplegics (relax the ciliary muscle), Steroids only for an initial 7 days (as they reduce collagen synthesis and impair healing). (Option B ruled out) Ascorbic acid (vitamin C) 10% E/D 2hrly. (promotes collagen synthesis and improves wound healing) Citrate 10% E/D 2 hourly for ten days (controls inflammation and inhibits collagenase) Tetracycline (collagenase inhibitor) Acetylcysteine 10% (anti-collagenase) Surgical management Early: Advancement of tenon capsule, limbal cell transplantation, amniotic membrane grafting Late: Symblepharon: Division of bands in Symblepharon, conjunctival grafting, mucous membrane grafting Limbal cells: Advancement of tenon capsule, limbal cell transplantation, amniotic membrane grafting. Complications Secondary glaucoma Limbal stem cell deficiency Pseudopterygium Corneal opacity (keratoplasty or keratoprosthesis).

      "question": "A 28-year-old male presents to the emergency department 10 days after sustaining blunt trauma to the face during a basketball game. He complains of diplopia and difficulty moving his left eye upwards. On examination, there is significant periorbital swelling. The X-ray is shown below. What does this X-ray indicate in this patient, and what is the most appropriate next step in management?",
      "options": {
        "A": "Orbital fat herniation; apply ice and prescribe analgesics",

      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Correct answer: B) Orbital floor fracture; surgical evaluation Explanation: The \" teardrop sign\" or “hanging drop sign ” on the X-ray suggests an orbital floor fracture , often associated with muscle entrapment, which leads to restricted eye movement and diplopia. The appropriate next step in management would be to evaluate for surgical intervention to relieve the entrapment and repair the fracture. Orbital floor fracture (also",
