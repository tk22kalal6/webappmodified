      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "immediately. The first and the most crucial step in treating chemical injuries is copious eye irrigation by double eversion of the lid with normal saline. Deliver a minimum of 2 liters of water in 20-30 minutes or until pH is restored. Management of Alkali Burns in the Eye: Initial Evaluation and Emergency Response Immediate Irrigation: Continue irrigation during transport to the hospital until ocular surface pH normalizes to 7.0–7.2. Borate buffer (e.g., Cederroth Eye Wash) may be more effective than saline or water. Monitor pH: Check ocular pH with narrow-range strips (6–8) every 15–30 minutes to confirm stabilization. Ophthalmic Examination: Perform a full exam after pH normalization: Treatment Based on Severity (Grade I–IV): Grade I (Mild Injuries): Treatment: Topical antibiotic ointments (e.g., bacitracin, erythromycin). (Option A ruled out) Preservative-free artificial tears for lubrication. Topical steroids (e.g., prednisolone acetate) for 1 week to reduce inflammation. (Option D ruled out) Cycloplegic agents (e.g., cyclopentolate) for comfort. Grades II–IV (Moderate to Severe Injuries): Anti-inflammatory Measures: Hourly topical prednisolone acetate in the first week, tapered after day 10. Long-acting cycloplegics (e.g., atropine) for pain relief. Oral tetracyclines (e.g., doxycycline) to inhibit matrix metalloproteinases and reduce corneal melting risk. High-dose vitamin C (topical/oral) to prevent corneal ulceration. Antibiotics: Topical broad-spectrum antibiotics (e.g., fluoroquinolones) to prevent superinfection. IOP Management: Use aqueous suppressants to control elevated IOP. Amniotic Membrane: Early placement of amniotic membrane (e.g., Prokera) for grades II–IV injuries to support epithelial healing. Surgical Management Debridement: Remove necrotic corneal and conjunctival epithelium with sponges or surgical instruments. Persistent Epithelial Defects: Use amniotic membranes for healing (sutured or Prokera). Ascorbic eye drops (Option B) promote collagen synthesis and improve wound healing but it is not the initial step.

      "explanation": "ophthalmic emergencies. Immediate and aggressive irrigation is the first and most critical step to minimize ocular damage. Chemical Injuries Eye injuries caused by chemicals range from mild irritation to vision loss. Sources of Injury Domestic: Ammonia, detergents, cosmetics Agriculture: Fertilizers, insecticides Laboratory: Acids, alkalis Assaults & Warfare: Acid attacks, chemical weapons Self-inflicted: Malingering or mental health conditions Alkali vs. Acid Burns Alkali: More severe, deeper penetration due to saponification, hygroscopic nature, and soluble compounds formation. Acid: Less severe, protein coagulation forms a protective barrier. Clinical Stages Acute: Conjunctival swelling, corneal epithelial loss, iris inflammation, possible corneal sloughing and staphyloma. Reparation: Epithelial regeneration, corneal vascularization, iris inflammation subsides. Complications: Symblepharon, recurrent ulcers, cataracts, secondary glaucoma. Emergency Management Immediate irrigation : Use water or saline for at least 20-30 minutes or until the eye’s pH is restored. A minimum of 2 liters should be used. (Option B) Mechanical removal : Gently remove any chemical particles with a cotton swab, particularly in lime burns. Necrotic tissue removal : Carefully excise dead conjunctiva and corneal epithelium using a cotton swab. Healing & Complication Prevention Topical antibiotics: Use broad-spectrum antibiotics like moxifloxacin to prevent infection. Topical steroids: Control inflammation and anterior uveitis. Use cautiously after two weeks to avoid hindering collagen production. Cycloplegics: Alleviate pain and dilate the pupil with agents like atropine. Ascorbic acid: Promote wound healing and collagen synthesis using topical and systemic Vitamin C. Lubricants: Use preservative-free artificial tears to keep the eye moist and support healing. Autologous serum: Use serum eye drops to provide essential growth factors for healing. Sodium citrate: Stabilise neutrophils and reduce collagenase activity with topical sodium citrate. Doxycycline: Inhibit collagenase activity with oral doxycycline. Symblepharon Prevention:Use a glass shell or sweep a glass rod in the fornices (spaces between the eyelid and eyeball) twice daily to prevent adhesions. Complication Management Secondary glaucoma: Control intraocular pressure with beta-blockers like timolol or carbonic anhydrase inhibitors such as acetazolamide. Limbal stem cell deficiency: Consider amniotic membrane or limbal stem cell transplantation. Pseudopterygium: Surgically remove abnormal conjunctival growth and consider autografting or amniotic membrane transplantation. Corneal opacity: Consider keratoplasty or keratoprosthesis for severe corneal damage. Implications Chemical injuries can cause permanent vision loss, physical disfigurement and psychological impact despite treatment. Take history (Option A): Taking history is important but not the priority in an emergency. Every second matters in chemical burns, and delaying irrigation can worsen corneal damage. Check vision in both eyes (Option C): Checking vision can be done after irrigation, but delaying decontamination increases ocular morbidity. Check IOP and plan for surgery (Option D): Checking intraocular pressure (IOP) and planning for surgery is important after initial management. Alkali burns can cause secondary glaucoma, but irrigation takes precedence",

      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "context of a flying foreign body injury, if the foreign body were made of iron, it could lead to iron deposition in the affected tissues, contributing to the development of hemochromatosis. Intraocular Foreign Bodies (IOFBs) Description An IOFB can lodge in any part of the anterior or posterior segments, causing mechanical damage, infection, or toxic effects on intraocular structures. Types Inert: Glass, wood, plastic, rubber, gold, silver, platinum Reactive: Organic and Inorganic (iron causing siderosis, copper causing chalcosis). Diagnosis History. Examination (wound examination, foreign body location, associated signs such as lid laceration and anterior segment damage should be noted). CT (investigation of choice) with axial and coronal cuts detects and localizes a metallic IOFB. MRI is contraindicated (metallic IOFB). Treatment Magnetic removal (metallic IOFB) Forceps removal through pars plana vitrectomy Prophylaxis against infection (topical/systemic antibiotics) Conservative and supportive management (topical corticosteroids, analgesics, etc). Modes of Damage: Mechanical Effects Depend on the size and velocity of the foreign body (FB). Introduction of Infection Metallic FB are usually sterile due to the heat generated on their emission. Pieces of wood or stone carry a greater chance of infection, often leading to endophthalmitis. Reactions to a Foreign Body (FB) Inert FB: No reaction. (Options C and D) Lead & Aluminium: Cause fibrosis (Option B) . Toxic Non-Metallic FB (Zinc, Copper, Mercury, Aluminium): Incite suppuration. Siderosis (Iron FB - Degenerative Changes Due to Electrolytic Dissociation and Dissemination): Earliest sign: Deposition in the anterior capsule of the lens, appearing as a rusty ring (pathognomonic). Heterochromia iridis: Hyperchromic. Visual loss: Due to pigmentary retinal dystrophy. Secondary chronic glaucoma. Diagnosis: Prussian blue reaction. Chalcosis (Copper from Alloy Deposited on Membranous Structures): Kayser-Fleischer Ring: Deposition in Descemet’s membrane (seen in Wilson’s disease). Sunflower cataract. No degenerative changes: Visual prognosis is good. Caterpillar Hair: Produces granulomatous iridocyclitis, known as Ophthalmia Nodosa.
