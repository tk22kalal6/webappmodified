      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: A) VA < 3/60 Explanation: NPCB Classification of Visual Impairment The National Programme for Control of Blindness (NPCB) in India defines blindness as \"visual acuity of <3/60 in a better eye with best possible correction\" and central visual field <10 degrees. The NPCB further categorizes visual impairment as: Classification Visual Acuity Visual Impairment Visual acuity of less than 6/18 in the better eye with available correction Low Vision Visual acuity of less than 6/18 to 6/60 Economic Blindness Visual acuity of less than 6/60 to 3/60 Social Blindness Visual acuity of less than 3/60 to 1/60 Manifest Blindness Visual acuity of less than 1/60 to the perception of light Absolute Blindness No perception of light WHO Classification of Visual Impairment The World Health Organization (WHO) defines blindness as \"visual acuity of less than 3/60 (Snellen) or its equivalent\". (Option A) The International Classification of Disease 11 (2018) classifies vision impairment into distance and near-presenting vision impairment Classification Visual Acuity Mild Distance Vision Impairment Presenting visual acuity worse than 6/12 Moderate Distance Vision Impairment Presenting visual acuity worse than 6/18 Severe Distance Vision Impairment Presenting visual acuity worse than 6/60 Blindness Presenting visual acuity worse than 3/60 Near Vision Impairment Presenting near vision acuity worse than N6 or M0.8 at 40 cm with existing correction Option B,C and D are incorrect.

      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Impairment Survey (2015-2019) , untreated cataract remains the leading cause of moderate to severe visual impairment . Cataracts, which cause the lens of the eye to become cloudy and impair vision, are particularly prevalent in older adults. When left untreated, cataracts can lead to significant visual impairment and blindness, making it a major contributor to visual disability worldwide. Major Causes of Blindness in population aged ≥ 50 years Cataract - 66.2% Corneal opacity (including trachomatous) Cataract surgical complications (including PCO) Posterior segment disease (excluding DR & ARMD) (Option D ruled out) Glaucoma (Option C ruled out) Major Causes of Visual Impairment in population aged ≥ 50 years Cataract - 71.2% (Option B) Refractive error (Option A ruled out) Cataract surgical complications (including PCO) Major Causes of Blindness in population aged 0-49 years Corneal opacity - 37.5 All globe/ CNS abnormality (Amblyopia) Phthisis Other/undetermined Major Causes of Visual Impairment in population aged 0-49 years Refractive error - 29.6 Cataract All globe/ CNS abnormality (Amblyopia) Corneal opacity Reference: National Blindness and Visual Impairment Survey",

      "explanation": "Correct Answer: C) Chlamydia trachomatis Explanation: A 14-day-old neonate with Bilateral conjunctivitis and pneumonia-like presentation is suggestive of Chlamydia trachomatis infection. Neonatal conjunctivitis is also known as Ophthalmia neonatorum. Ophthalmia neonatorum: Definition Ophthalmia neonatorum or neonatal conjunctivitis is a mucoid, mucopurulent, or purulent discharge from one or both eyes in the first month of life. Any discharge, even watery, from a baby’s eyes in the first week of life must be viewed under suspicion as tears are not secreted so early in life. Aetiology of ophthalmia neonatorum Mode of infection: Before birth: Very rare through infected liquor amnii During birth: From an infected birth canal After birth: During the first bath of a newborn Soiled clothes Fingers with infected lochia Source of infection: Neisseria gonorrhoeae: Transmitted at the time of delivery Presents between 2-5 days of birth (Option B) The discharge becomes mucopurulent and purulent quickly Thick yellow pus and marked chemosis Cornea seen at the bottom of a crater-like pit in severe cases Chlamydia trachomatis: Transmitted at the time of delivery Onset at 5-14 days after birth (Option C) Serotypes D to K are the most common cause of ophthalmia neonatorum in developed countries Characteristic intracellular inclusion bodies are seen Less severe inflammation Purulent discharge + Other causes: Staphylococci/ Streptococcus pneumoniae (Option A) Gram-negative coliforms Herpes simplex virus Chemical: silver nitrate solution previously used for prophylaxis immediately after birth : erythema, chemosis, lid edema, and discharge within the first 24 hours after birth. Prophylaxis Antenatal measures: Treatment of genital infections and care of mother Surveillance of pregnant women for STDs Natal measures: Aseptic, sterile precautions to be followed during deliveries Clean the infant’s closed lids with sterile cotton soaked in normal saline and dried Post-natal measures: Povidone-iodine 2.5% solution If the mother is under suspicion, 1% tetracycline or 0.5% erythromycin eye ointment is used in the baby immediately after birth and watched for a week. Ceftriaxone 50mg/kg IM or IV single dose for infants born to mothers with untreated gonococcal infection. Crede’s method: Old method using 1% silver nitrate applied to infants' eyes right after birth It is NOT used now as it can cause chemical neonatal conjunctivitis. Diagnosis Treatment Neisseria gonorrhoea Ceftriaxone IM, gentamicin drops, bacitracin eye ointment Chemical Wash eyes, erythromycin ointment, observe Other bacteria Neomycin-bacitracin ointment, gentamicin, or tobramycin drops Herpes simplex virus Acyclovir 3% eye ointment, systemic acyclovir (systemic involvement) Chlamydia trachomatis Erythromycin or chlortetracycline eye ointment, oral erythromycin (systemic infection) Incorrect options: Streptococci (Option A) and Mycoplasma (Option D): Though they can cause conjunctivitis and pneumonia, it is very rare in the case of a newborn.",

Incorrect Options: Option A. Cataract: Cataract has been a longstanding focus in the Vision 20/20 program in India, with efforts made to increase access to cataract surgeries and reduce cataract-related blindness. It is not the recent addition to the program. Option B. Childhood blindness: Although childhood blindness is an important concern, it is not the recent addition to the Vision 20/20 program in India. The program has long recognized the need for addressing childhood blindness and implementing interventions such as Vitamin A supplementation and pediatric eye care services. Option C. Glaucoma: Glaucoma is a significant cause of visual impairment and blindness, but it is not the recent addition to the Vision 20/20 program in India. Efforts to raise awareness, improve early detection, and provide appropriate treatment for glaucoma have been ongoing for some time. Reference: .",
