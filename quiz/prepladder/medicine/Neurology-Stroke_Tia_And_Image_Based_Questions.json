      "explanation": "extensor plantar response Correct Answer: C) Oppenheim’s sign - Apply pressure along the medial aspect of tibia causing an extensor plantar response. Explanation : Oppenheim’s sign is elicited by applying pressure along the medial aspect of tibia to cause an extensor plantar response i.e. dorsiflexion of the great toe and fanning of the other toes. (Option C) Babinski’s sign is elicited by stroking the lateral aspect of the sole from the heel towards the little toe and then continuing up to the great toe. This results in an extensor plantar response as described above in a case of upper motor neuron lesion. Flexion of all toes indicates a normal person or the presence of a lower motor neuron lesion. (Option A ruled out) Gordon’s sign is elicited by squeezing the calf muscles to produce an extensor plantar response.

      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: B) Embolic occlusion with reperfusion before permanent infarction. Explanation: Transient Ischemic Attack (TIA) is a temporary blockage of blood flow, usually due to a small embolus, which resolves before permanent brain damage occurs. Transient Ischemic Attack (TIA) Defined as a transient episode of neurologic dysfunction due to the focal brain, spinal cord, or retinal ischemia without acute infarction or tissue injury. A TIA typically lasts less than an hour, more often minutes. Usually resolves within 24 hours. Risk is highest in the first 48 hours following a transient ischemic attack. Etiology: Common risk factors for all TIA include diabetes, hypertension, age, smoking, obesity, alcoholism, unhealthy diet, psychosocial stress, and lack of regular physical activity. A previous history of stroke or TIA will increase substantially the subsequent risk of recurrent stroke or TIA. Pathophysiology: TIA subtypes, classified according to the pathophysiological mechanisms Large artery atherothrombosis (M/C): This may be intracranial or extracranial atherothrombosis. The mechanism may be a lack of blood flow distal to the site of arterial stenosis or an artery-to-artery embolism. Small vessel ischemic diseases: The underlying pathology is either lipohyalinosis or small vessel arteriolosclerosis. The commonest risk factor is hypertension, followed by diabetes and age. Cardiac embolism: A clot in the cardiac chamber, most commonly in the left atrium , is secondary to atrial fibrillation. Cryptogenic : This is usually a cortical pattern of ischemia without any identifiable large artery atherothrombosis or cardiac source of emboli. More recently it is often referred to as ESUS (embolic stroke of unknown source). Other uncommon causes such as arterial dissection or vasculitis.

      "explanation": "Correct Answer: B) Urinary catheterisation is recommended for routine bladder care. Explanation: Among the given options, urinary catheterisation for routine bladder care is not recommended in stroke patients as it increases the risk of urinary tract infections in these patients, thereby increasing the duration of hospital stay . It is recommended only in cases of acute urinary retention or incontinence threatening to pressure areas . Supportive measures to improve stroke outcome 1. Airway Perform bedside screening for dysphagia and keep patients nil per oral , if swallowing is unsafe or aspiration occurs. 2.Breathing Check respiratory rate and give oxygen if saturation < 95%. 3.Circulation Check peripheral perfusion , pulse and blood pressure. Treat abnormalities with fluid replacement , antiarrhythmics and inotropic drugs as appropriate. 4. Hydration If signs of dehydration, give fluids parenterally or by nasogastric tube. 5.Nutrition Assess nutritional status and provide supplements if needed. If dysphagia persists for >48 hrs , start feeding via nasogastric tube instead of oral. Consider other routes for essential medications if dysphagia is present. 6.Glycemic control Check blood glucose and treat when levels are ≥ 200 mg/dl by insulin infusion or glucose/potassium/insulin combination. Monitor closely to avoid hypoglycemia . 7.Temperature Look for fever, investigate and treat underlying cause Control with antipyretics , as raised brain temperature may increase infarct volume.

        "D": "Absence of hemorrhage on CT"
      },
      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: C) Recent gastrointestinal bleed Explanation : A gastrointestinal bleed within the past 21 days is a clear contraindication to rtPA due to the high risk of rebleeding. In this case, the patient's recent GI bleed 10 days ago makes thrombolysis contraindicated. Indications and contraindications for thrombolysis Indications for rtPA in Acute Ischemic Stroke (AIS) Clinical Diagnosis of Stroke: The patient presents with clinical features of acute stroke, confirmed by a neurological examination. No Evidence of Haemorrhage on Imaging : A non-contrast CT scan must exclude hemorrhagic stroke before administering rtPA. (Option D ruled out) Time Window: Administer within 3 hours of symptom onset (FDA); in some regions, the window is extended to 4.5 hours with restrictions. (Option A ruled out) Age : The patient must be 18 years or older. Contraindications for rtPA in AIS Conditions Increasing Bleeding Risk: Active internal bleeding, bleeding diathesis, recent head trauma (within 3 months), recent intracranial hemorrhage, major surgery in the last 14 days, gastrointestinal bleeding in the past 21 days, recent myocardial infarction. (Option C) Uncontrolled Hypertension: Blood pressure >185/110 mmHg despite treatment increases the risk of hemorrhagic complications. (Option B ruled out) Large Infarct Core: CT scan revealing significant edema in more than one-third of the MCA territory is contraindicated due to the risk of hemorrhage and limited benefit. Additional Points to Consider Use of Antithrombotic Agents: Concomitant use of anticoagulants requires careful evaluation to avoid increasing bleeding risk. Advanced Imaging: Techniques like CT perfusion or MRI may help identify patients eligible for rtPA beyond the standard time window, even up to 24 hours in some cases, though this approach remains investigational.

Administering rtPA can significantly improve clinical outcomes by dissolving the clot and restoring blood flow to the brain. Treatment for stroke- ischemic stroke Immediate Medical Support Stabilize the patient by managing airway, breathing, and circulation (ABCs) . Manage blood pressure : Permissive hypertension is allowed to maintain cerebral perfusion, but reduce BP if >220/120 mmHg ( reduce BP if >185/110 mmHg- for rtPA). Avoid overly aggressive reduction .

      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: B) Non-contrast Computed Tomography (CT) Explanation: Non-contrast CT is the gold standard initial imaging modality for stroke evaluation in the acute setting. It is fast, widely available, and highly effective at distinguishing between ischemic and hemorrhagic stroke , which is critical for determining appropriate treatment. In ischemic stroke, the CT may be normal early on, but it rules out hemorrhage, which would contraindicate the use of thrombolytic therapy. Workup for stroke Initial Assessment and Stabilization Upon arrival, ensure the ABCs (Airway, Breathing, Circulation) are stable. Blood glucose levels should be checked quickly to address hypoglycemia or hyperglycemia. Determining Stroke Type: Imaging is Key A non-contrast CT scan is the primary imaging modality for differentiating between ischemic and hemorrhagic strokes. Clinical features may suggest stroke type, but imaging is essential for confirmation as no clinical finding can definitively differentiate between the two. Further Investigations: Uncovering the Cause Detailed History and Physical Exam: Consider risk factors (hypertension, diabetes, smoking, atrial fibrillation, etc.) and perform a neurological exam to localize the affected brain area. Laboratory Tests : Perform CBC, electrolytes, renal function, blood glucose, lipid profile, coagulation studies, ESR, and ECG (to detect arrhythmias and signs of recent MI). Visualizing the Cerebral Vasculature: Imaging Techniques CT Angiography (CTA) : Assesses cerebral vasculature and identifies blockages/stenosis, but is performed after non-contrast CT has ruled out hemorrhage (not for stroke type differentiation). (Option C ruled out) CT Perfusion Imaging : Assesses blood flow, identifying reduced perfusion and ischemic penumbra. MRI: Provides more detail but takes longer than CT and is not as widely available, thus not the first imaging choice for acute stroke evaluation. (Option A ruled out) MRA: Offers detailed images of blood vessels, similar to CTA. Cerebral Angiography: Gold standard for vessel evaluation , used when other techniques are inconclusive or before endovascular intervention. Ultrasound Techniques : Carotid Duplex Ultrasonography assesses carotid stenosis but is not a first-line acute imaging modality; Transcranial Doppler (TCD) measures blood flow velocity in intracranial arteries. (Option D ruled out) Tailoring Investigations Based on Stroke Type Ischemic Stroke : Focuses on identifying the source of the blockage (cardioembolic, artery-to-artery embolic, small vessel disease). Hemorrhagic Stroke: Investigations focus on identifying causes of bleeding (e.g., hypertension, aneurysm, vascular malformation).

      "explanation": "arm and face, aphasia (difficulty speaking), gaze deviation, and homonymous hemianopia - all classic features of an MCA stroke , typically affecting the dominant hemisphere. Stroke clinical features based on the location of the thrombus: Location Clinical Features Middle Cerebral Artery (MCA) Thrombosis Most common artery involved in stroke. Contralateral hemiparesis and hemisensory loss: More prominent in the face and upper limb than the lower limb. Dysarthria caused by both dominant and non dominant hemispheres. Broca’s aphasia (expressive) in the superior division infarct. Wernicke’s aphasia (receptive) in the inferior division infarct. Neglect Homonymous hemianopia : Loss of vision in the same visual field of both eyes. Gaze preference towards the side of the lesion. Anterior Cerebral Artery (ACA) Thrombosis (Option A ruled out) Contralateral hemiparesis and sensory loss: More pronounced in the lower limb than the upper limb. Urinary incontinence: Due to involvement of the medial frontal micturition centers. Behavioral or personality changes: Due to involvement of the prefrontal cortex (apathy, disinhibition). Abulia (lack of will) and apraxia. Upper extremity and face are spared. Posterior Cerebral Artery (PCA) Thrombosis (Option C ruled out) Contralateral homonymous hemianopia with macular sparing (due to collateral blood supply from MCA). Visual agnosia (inability to recognize objects). Alexia without agraphia: Inability to read without difficulty writing (if the dominant hemisphere is involved). Contralateral sensory loss or thalamic pain syndrome: Due to infarction in the thalamus (Dejerine-Roussy syndrome). Memory impairment: If the temporal lobe is affected. Vertebrobasilar Artery Thrombosis (Option D ruled out) The clinical presentation includes ataxia, vertigo, headache, vomiting, oropharyngeal dysfunction, visual field deficits, and abnormal oculomotor findings. Patterns of clinical presentation vary depending on the location and the infarction pattern of embolism or atherosclerosis. Cerebellar Infarction Patients may present with ataxia, nausea, vomiting, headache, dysarthria, and vertigo symptoms. Lacunar Infarction Lacunar infarcts result from the occlusion of small perforating or penetrating arteries. Infarcts are smaller than 1 centimeter in diameter. Present with a pure motor or sensory loss, sensorimotor deficit or ataxic-hemiparesis. Reference: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK499997/",

      },
      "correct_answer": "D",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: D) > 1.5 cm Explanation : Strokes of large artery atherosclerotic origin are typically associated with lesions larger than 1.5 cm on MRI or CT imaging. Lesions of this size suggest involvement of large vessels, while smaller lesions are more often related to lacunar infarcts. Acute Ischemic stroke Acute stroke is the acute onset of focal neurological deficits in a vascular territory affecting the brain, retina, or spinal cord due to underlying cerebrovascular diseases. Etiology: The etiology of ischemic stroke is a thrombotic or embolic event that causes an impairment of blood flow to an area of the brain. In a thrombotic event , the blood flow to the brain is obstructed within the blood vessel due to a thrombus within the vessel itself, usually secondary to atherosclerotic disease, arterial dissection, fibromuscular dysplasia. In an embolic event, debris from elsewhere in the body blocks blood flow through the affected vessel. The source of emboli can be the proximal artery, such as an atherosclerotic plaque in the internal carotid artery, causing an artery-to-artery embolic stroke distally from any proximal source, commonly from the heart. Cardioembolism Comprises patients with arterial blockages likely caused by an embolism originating in the heart. At least 1 cardiac source of an embolus must be identified to consider a possible or probable diagnosis of cardioembolic stroke. Evidence of a previous transient ischemic attack (TIA) or stroke in more than 1 vascular territory or systemic embolisms supports a clinical diagnosis of cardiogenic stroke. A stroke occurring in a patient with a medium-risk cardiac source of embolism and no other apparent cause of stroke is categorized as a possible cardioembolic stroke. Large artery atherosclerosis Patients will exhibit clinical and brain imaging findings indicating either significant (> 50%) narrowing or complete blockage of a major brain artery or branch cortical artery, likely due to atherosclerosis. Presence of intermittent claudication history, TIAs in the same vascular territory, a carotid bruit, or weakened pulses. Lesions in the cortex, cerebellum, brainstem, or subcortical hemispheric infarctions > 1.5 cm in diameter observed on CT or MRI indicate potential large artery atherosclerotic origin. Duplex imaging or arteriography demonstrating more than 50% stenosis of a relevant intracranial or extracranial artery is necessary . Small vessel occlusion Patients with strokes commonly classified as lacunar infarcts in other systems. Patients should present with 1 of the typical clinical lacunar syndromes and should not exhibit signs of cerebral cortical dysfunction. Patients should have normal CT scan or MRI findings Brainstem or subcortical hemisphere lesion with a diameter of <1.5 cm. Stroke of undetermined etiology Patient with atrial fibrillation and ipsilateral carotid stenosis of 50%. Traditional lacunar syndrome and ipsilateral carotid stenosis of 50%. Stroke of other determined etiology Patients with uncommon stroke causes, such as nonatherosclerotic vasculopathies, hypercoagulable states, or hematologic disorders. Patients in this category should exhibit clinical symptoms and CT or MRI findings indicative of acute ischemic stroke, regardless of the size or location of the lesion. Diagnostic tests, such as blood tests or arteriography, should reveal 1 of these unusual stroke causes. Reference: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK499997/",
