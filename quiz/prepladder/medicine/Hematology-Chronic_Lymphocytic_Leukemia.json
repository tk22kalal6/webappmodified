Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia (ALL) accounts for approximately one-third of all childhood malignancies and is the most common form of cancer in children . Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia (CLL) is the most common leukaemia in Western countries and is most commonly seen in the geriatric population . Chronic Myeloid Leukemia (CML) can occur in all age groups from adults to the elderly population, and the incidence increases with age but is rare in the pediatric population.

      "explanation": "and is the most commonly seen in the elderly . Chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) It is a monoclonal proliferation of mature B lymphocytes defined by an absolute number of malignant cells (absolute lymphocyte count) in the blood (5 × 10 9 /mL) for consecutive 3 months . The majority of the cases are asymptomatic and are mostly incidental diagnoses. Family history and genetic predisposition may contribute to CLL but not radiation exposure. The presence of malignant B cells under this count in the blood without nodal, spleen, or liver involvement and absent cytopenias is a precursor of monoclonal B cell lymphocytosis (MBL). Note: Exposure to radiation is one of the risk factors for Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML), Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia (ALL) and Chronic Myeloid Leukemia (CML). AML (Option A) is an aggressive tumor comprised of immature myeloid lineage blasts , associated with diverse acquired mutations, which interfere with myeloid differentiation. ALL (Option B) is characterized by the overproduction of immature lymphoblasts in the bone marrow. Peripheral blood smear examination typically shows a predominance of lymphoblasts, which are larger in size compared to mature lymphocytes. CML (Option D) is a myeloproliferative neoplasm characterized by the excessive production of granulocytes in the bone marrow. Peripheral blood smear examination in CML typically shows increased numbers of granulocytes, including mature neutrophils, myelocytes, and metamyelocytes, as well as basophilia.

Pathophysiology of chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL): The most common cytogenetic abnormality in CLL, del(13)(q14.3) , leads to the loss of the miR15/16 cluster, which plays a key role in CLL development. Normally, miR15A/miR16A suppresses the expression of anti-apoptotic genes like BCL2, CCND1, CCND3, and CDK6 . The deletion of this cluster results in the overexpression of these genes, promoting increased cell survival . The loss of other microRNAs, such as miR-181a , leads to the overexpression of proteins like MCL-1 and TCL1, which further enhance cell survival. Moreover, the overexpression of miR-155 , an onco-miR linked to B-cell transformation, has been observed in the majority of CLL patients.

Elevated LDH levels are common. Diagnosis 18FDG-PET/CT scan is the first step to localize areas for biopsy. Excisional biopsy is preferred; fine-needle aspiration is discouraged. Treatment Treatment decisions should be based on confirmed diagnosis and staging.
