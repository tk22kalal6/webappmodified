      "question": "A patient with type 2 diabetes mellitus experiences hypoglycemia and sustains a fall. Due to incoherent speech, a CT scan is performed and reveals a substantial subdural hematoma (SDH) with a volume greater than 30 cc. What should be the immediate next step in management?",
      "options": {
        "A": "Administer Mannitol",
        "B": "Administer Aspirin and Clopidogrel",

        "D": "Stabilize the patient and urgently seek a neurosurgical consultation"
      },
      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: C) Perform a Craniotomy Explanation: The scenario presents a case of acute subdural hematoma with significant volume (>30 cc) requiring immediate surgical intervention . In acute SDH, CT imaging shows hyperdense (white) appearance, and when the volume exceeds 30 cc, there is a substantial risk of brain compression and herniation . Emergency Craniotomy represents the definitive treatment in this setting, allowing for immediate evacuation of the hematoma to prevent further neurological deterioration and potential fatal complications. Acute SDH vs Chronic SDH: Feature Acute SDH Chronic SDH Timing 0-72 hours >3 weeks Clinical Features Rapid deterioration Loss of consciousness Focal deficits High mortality Gradual onset Confusion Headache Gait disturbance Better prognosis Risk Factors Severe trauma Young adults Coagulopathy Elderly Brain atrophy Anticoagulation Minor trauma CT Findings Hyperdense crescent Immediate mass effect Hypodense/mixed density Bilateral in 20-30% Gradual mass effect Management Emergency craniotomy Reverse coagulopathy ICU care Burr hole drainage Hold anticoagulation May observe small ones Administer Mannitol (Option A) is used to manage elevated intracranial pressure, but it is not the definitive treatment for a large subdural hematoma. While mannitol can temporarily reduce intracranial pressure, it does not address the underlying compression from the hematoma, which requires surgical evacuation. Administer Aspirin and Clopidogrel (Option B) would be contraindicated in acute SDH as these antiplatelet agents could worsen the bleeding. In fact, if the patient was previously on these medications, they would need to be discontinued and potentially reversed depending on the clinical situation. Stabilize the patient and urgently seek a neurosurgical consultation (Option D) while important, delays the definitive treatment needed in this case. Given the large volume of the hematoma and altered mental status, immediate surgical intervention through craniotomy is required rather than waiting for further consultation.

        "A": "Intravenous digoxin",
        "B": "Oxygen supplementation",
        "C": "Immediate descent",
        "D": "Acetazolamide"
      },
      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: A) Intravenous digoxin Explanation: A breathless patient at a high altitude of 3000 meters suggests High-Altitude Pulmonary Edema (HAPE) , and intravenous digoxin is not used in its management. High-Altitude Pulmonary Edema (HAPE): Risk Factors: Rapid ascent, history of HAPE, respiratory infections, cold temperatures. Cardiopulmonary abnormalities (e.g., mitral stenosis, primary pulmonary hypertension) increase risk, even at moderate altitudes. Clinical Features: Reduced exercise tolerance greater than expected at altitude. Dry cough may precede, followed by blood-tinged sputum. Tachypnea, tachycardia, crackles on auscultation. Hypoxemia and respiratory alkalosis are present unless on acetazolamide (which may cause metabolic acidosis). Investigation: Chest X-ray: Patchy or streaky interstitial edema. Electrocardiograms: Right ventricular strain or hypertrophy. Prevention: Gradual ascent is key to acclimatization. Sustained-release nifedipine (30 mg twice daily) prevents HAPE in those ascending rapidly or with a history of HAPE. Acetazolamide (Option D) and dexamethasone are potential options, though their roles require careful monitoring. Treatment: Immediate descent (Option C) and supplemental oxygen (Option B) (targeting >90% saturation) are the most effective treatments. Maintain rest, warmth, and limit exertion. Hyperbaric therapy (portable altitude chamber) may be lifesaving if descent is not possible. Oral nifedipine as adjunctive therapy.

      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: A) 37 degree C Explanation: The recommended temperature of a water bath for a patient with frostbite is 37 degree C. Frostbite: Pathophysiology: Tissue freezes below 0°C (32°F), leading to the ice-crystal formation that destroys the cellular structure. Vascular endothelial damage causes stasis, microvascular thrombosis, and progressive dermal ischemia. Thrombosis, ischemia, and necrosis lead to mummification and demarcation over weeks to months. Clinical Presentation: Symptoms: Sensory deficits (light touch, pain, or temperature perception); \"chunk of wood\" sensation in extremities. Signs: Superficial frostbite: Anesthesia, erythema, pliable subcutaneous tissue, and no tissue loss. Deep frostbite: Waxy, mottled, violaceous-white tissue; hemorrhagic vesicles indicate severe injury. Treatment: Rewarming: Immerse frozen tissue in circulating water at 37°- 40°C (99°-104°F) for 30-60 minutes. Avoid premature termination of thawing despite the pain. Medical Management: Prostacyclin analogs (e.g., iloprost) within 48 hours. Thrombolysis (rt-PA) and heparin for deep frostbite within 24 hours to reduce amputation risk. Surgical Considerations: Delay debridement or amputation until demarcation. Reference: Harrison’s Principles of Internal Medicine, 21st Edition, Page 3633,3634",

      "question": "During a scorching summer afternoon, a man, who had been toiling in a field, unexpectedly collapsed. Upon examination, there were no apparent physical indications of dehydration, although his radial pulse was detectable. The doctor determined that the man's serum electrolyte levels were within the normal range. Shockingly, the man's body temperature measured 106 degrees Fahrenheit. Considering these circumstances, which of the following should be administered as an initial form of immediate assistance?",

In severe cases of frostbite where tissue damage is extensive and irreversible, amputation may be necessary to remove dead or gangrenous tissue (Option A) and prevent the spread of infection. Therefore, amputation can be a part of the management in severe cases. Rewarming the affected area (Option B) is a critical step in the management of frostbite. It should be done using warm water (not hot) or by placing the affected area in a warm environment. Rewarming helps to restore blood flow and prevent further tissue damage. After rewarming, the affected area should be gently dried and cleaned to prevent infection. (Option D) Cleaning helps remove any debris or contaminants from the damaged tissue.

        "D": "Less air and less heparin in the ABG sample"
      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: B) Excess air and more heparin in the ABG sample Explanation: The change in the pH without a change in the bicarbonate level indicates excess heparinization . The increased pO 2 shows excess air . Effects of excess heparin: Heparin is a sulfated mucopolysaccharide with acidic properties. The excess of heparin in the ABG syringe can have the following effects: Effect on pH: If the pH is normal or alkaline (high) to begin with, acidemia increases i.e., the pH will fall on contact with the acidic heparin. If the pH is very acidic to begin with, acidemia decreases i.e., the pH will rise as the mildly acidic heparin reduces the greater acidity of the blood. Delusional effect: The PaO 2 and PaCO 2 can also be falsely lowered by dilution. Reference: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/3919622/",

      "explanation": "Correct Answer: D) Prazosin Explanation: The patient might be suffering from a scorpion sting cardiotoxicity as per his symptoms and the best choice of medication here is Prazosin . Treatment of scorpion sting: Identification of the scorpion species is essential for determining treatment, as stings from non-lethal species typically only require basic care. Non-lethal stings : Most stings cause local discomfort and can be managed at home with ice packs, analgesics, or antihistamines. Patients should return to the emergency department if cranial-nerve or neuromuscular symptoms develop. Severe envenomations : Aggressive supportive care and careful use of antivenom can prevent deaths from more dangerous stings. Initial measures : Keeping the patient calm, applying pressure dressings, and using cold packs can reduce venom absorption. Treatment for symptoms : Continuous IV infusion of midazolam can control agitation and muscle movements, but close monitoring is needed due to the risk of respiratory arrest, especially when sedatives or narcotics are used. Management of complications : Hypertension and Pulmonary oedema : Managed with Nifedipine, Nitroprusside, Hydralazine, or Prazosin . Bradycardia : Managed with atropine. Antivenin : FDA-approved antivenin (C. sculpturatus IgG F(ab')2 in horse serum) is available in some countries and can rapidly reverse cranial-nerve dysfunction and muscular symptoms when administered intravenously. Incorrect Options: Anti-snake venom (Option A) is a specific treatment used for snakebite envenomation and is not indicated in the given scenario. Adrenaline (Option B) is commonly used in emergencies to treat severe allergic reactions and cardiac arrest. Steroids (Option C) , such as corticosteroids have anti-inflammatory and immunosuppressive effects. They are generally used in allergic reactions, autoimmune disorders, and asthma.
