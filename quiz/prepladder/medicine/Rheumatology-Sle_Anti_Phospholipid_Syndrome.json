      "correct_answer": "D",
      "explanation": "ANA and anti-dsDNA antibodies suggest systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). Elevated levels of IFN- α play a crucial role in SLE pathogenesis by promoting B cell activation and increasing antibody production , particularly autoantibodies such as anti-dsDNA. Predisposing/Risk factors of SLE Genetic factors Environmental factors Complement deficiencies of C1q, C2, and C4 TREX1 gene mutations Affecting antigen presentation of HLA-DRB, DR3, DQA2 Enhanced innate immunity , mainly increased production of IFNs Gender: Female OCPs and HRT Ultraviolet light Smoking Silicosis Vitamin D deficiency EBV infection. Pathogenesis of SLE: Decreased B cell activation (Option A): IFN- α promotes B cell activation and survival, not decreases it . This contributes to autoantibody production in SLE. Enhanced clearance of apoptotic c ells (Option B): In SLE, clearance is defective , contributing to accumulation of nuclear debris → triggers autoimmunity. Suppression of T cell activity (Option C): IFN- α activates dendritic cells and promotes T cell activation , not suppression.

      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "appropriate management strategy is high-dose glucocorticoids and cyclophosphamide . Management of Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE): 1. Mild to Moderate Disease: Physical and lifestyle modifications like stress reduction techniques, smoking cessation, photoprotection and diet rich in vitamin D. Analgesics and NSAIDs Hydroxychloroquine (Option B) Glucocorticoids (Option C) (prednisolone 5–20 mg/day) - often combined with immunosuppressants such as: Methotrexate Azathioprine Mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) Increased glucocorticoid doses may be needed for flares (e.g., pleurisy, pericarditis) Belimumab (a monoclonal antibody targeting BLyS) and anifrolumab are effective for persistent disease activity. 2. Severe and Life-Threatening Disease: High-dose glucocorticoids and immunosuppressants for organ involvement Common Regimen: Pulsed methylprednisolone IV (10 mg/kg) for 3 days, followed by oral steroid. Cyclophosphamide (15 mg/kg IV), repeated every 2–3 weeks for six cycles. Patients with significant proteinuria (>500 mg daily) should receive ACE inhibitors or ARBs to prevent ESRD. Safety Considerations: Cyclophosphamide may cause hemorrhagic cystitis; minimise risk with hydration and mesna (2-mercaptoethane sulfonate). Consider sperm or oocyte collection before treatment due to the risks of azoospermia and premature menopause. Alternate Therapy: MMF can be used with high-dose glucocorticoids for renal involvement . It shows similar efficacy to cyclophosphamide with fewer side effects. Belimumab and Rituximab. 3. Maintenance Therapy: (Post Acute Management) Gradual reduction of oral prednisolone from 40–60 to 10–15 mg/day within 3 months. Mycophenolate and azathioprine are preferred; both are safer than cyclophosphamide. Aim for the lowest effective doses, regularly reassessing function and disease activity.

      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "with elevated anti- β 2-glycoprotein I antibodies, suggests antiphospholipid syndrome (APS). In APS, increased endothelial cell apoptosis exposes negatively charged phospholipids, promoting the formation of antiphospholipid antibodies. Antiphospholipid Syndrome (APS) is an acquired thrombophilia mediated by autoantibodies, characterised by recurrent arterial or venous thrombosis and/or pregnancy-related complications. It predominantly affects females and can occur as: Primary APS : Occurs independently. Secondary APS : Associated mainly with SLE and other autoimmune diseases. Target of Antibodies: The primary autoantibodies in APS target negatively charged phospholipids (PLs) and PL-binding proteins, such as β 2-glycoprotein I ( β 2GPI) and prothrombin. Antibodies may also target: Lupus Anticoagulant Cardiolipin Phosphatidylserine Protein C Pathogenesis: It is triggered by infections, oxidative stress, and significant physical stressors (surgery or trauma) in genetically predisposed individuals, resulting in increased apoptosis of endothelial cells and the exposure of negatively charged phospholipids (PL). Exposed PLs bind to serum proteins such as β 2-glycoprotein I ( β 2GPI) and prothrombin , forming neo-antigens . The immune system produces antibodies against these neo-antigens, leading to anti-PL antibodies. The binding of anti-PL antibodies to disrupted endothelial cells initiates coagulation, resulting in thrombus formation. Clinical Manifestations: Venous Thrombosis: Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT) (39%) Pulmonary Embolism Superficial Thrombophlebitis Arterial Thrombosis: Stroke (20%) Transient Ischemic Attack (TIA) and Myocardial Ischemia Obstetric Complications: Recurrent first-trimester abortions ( ≥ 3). Unexplained death of a morphologically normal fetus after 10 weeks. Severe early pre-eclampsia. Hematologic findings: Thrombocytopenia and Autoimmune Hemolytic Anemia Livedo Reticularis : A mottled, lace-like purplish skin discolouration, often occurring with vascular lesions and aseptic bone necrosis. Libman-Sacks endocarditis : Characterized by small vegetations with organised platelet-fibrin microthrombi. Renal involvement : May present as hypertension, elevated serum creatinine, and proteinuria, with associated thrombotic microangiopathy. Deactivation of the complement pathway (Option A): APS is primarily associated with antiphospholipid antibodies that activate the coagulation cascade rather than deactivate the complement pathway. Impaired fibrinolysis (Option C) : APS is mainly characterised by increased coagulation and platelet activation rather than a failure to break down clots. Decreased platelet activation (Option D) : In APS, the presence of antiphospholipid antibodies leads to increased platelet activation, contributing to thrombus formation.",

      "question": "A 32-year-old woman with a known history of antiphospholipid syndrome (APS) was admitted to the hospital due to arterial thrombosis. She had a history of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) one year ago, for which she was treated with warfarin. She has been adherent to her warfarin therapy, with a target INR of 2.5. Investigations show the following reports. INR: 2.1 Lupus antibody: Positive Anticardiolipin antibody: Positive Anti- β 2 glycoprotein I antibodies: Positive What would be the most appropriate adjustment to her treatment after this arterial thrombosis episode?",
      "options": {
        "A": "Administration of oral hydroxychloroquine",
        "B": "Increase the dose of warfarin with a target INR of 3.0 to 4.0",
        "C": "Switch to direct oral thrombin inhibitor",
        "D": "Switch to low-dose aspirin with prophylactic dose low molecular weight heparin."
      },

      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "anticardiolipin antibodies(gives false positive RPR for syphilis) and Anti-beta-2-glycoprotein-I, which aids in the diagnosis of antiphospholipid syndrome. Tests for detecting lupus anticoagulant: Test Principle Interpretation Dilute Russell Viper Venom Time (DRVVT) Test (Option D ruled out) Utilises dilute Russell viper venom to activate factor X in the clotting cascade. Presence of lupus anticoagulant inhibits factor X activation , leading to prolonged clotting time (no clot formation). Kaolin Clotting Time (Option C ruled out) Measures the time taken for a clot to form in the presence of kaolin, an activator of the intrinsic pathway. Increased kaolin clotting time indicates the presence of lupus anticoagulant, impairing normal coagulation. Activated Partial Thromboplastin Time (aPTT) (Option B ruled out) Assesses the intrinsic and common pathways of coagulation by measuring the clotting time after adding an activator to plasma. Prolonged aPTT suggests the presence of lupus anticoagulant, as it binds to β 2-glycoprotein I or prothrombin and interferes with clotting.
