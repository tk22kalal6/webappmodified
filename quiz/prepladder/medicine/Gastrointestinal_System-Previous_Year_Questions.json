      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: B) Tofacitinib Explanation: Tofacitinib is a oral JAK inhibitor that works by inhibiting the JAK-STAT pathway, which regulates cytokine-mediated inflammation. It is approved for the treatment of moderate to severe ulcerative colitis, particularly in patients who are refractory or intolerant to anti-TNF agents like infliximab or adalimumab. Tofacitinib is a JAK 1/3 inhibitor and blocks the production of inflammatory cytokines such as interleukin-6 and interferons. It is effective for inducing and maintaining remission in moderate to severe ulcerative colitis. Side effects include an increased risk of infections, venous thromboembolism, and lipid elevation, requiring careful patient selection and monitoring. Vedolizumab (Option A) is an anti-integrin monoclonal antibody targeting α 4 β 7 integrin, used to treat moderate to severe ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease. Ozanimod (Option C) is an FDA-approved sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P1) receptor modulator for moderate to severe ulcerative colitis, reducing lymphocyte migration to the gut. Leflunomide (Option D) is a pyrimidine synthesis inhibitor primarily for rheumatoid arthritis treatment.

      "explanation": "Correct Answer: B) Pyoderma gangrenosum Explanation: The given clinical scenario and image are suggestive of Pyoderma gangrenosum which is more common in Ulcerative colitis a type of inflammatory bowel disease. Pyoderma gangrenosum is a rare, inflammatory skin condition characterized by the development of painful, ulcerative lesions. It can occur in patients with inflammatory bowel disease, and the lower limbs are a common site of involvement. The ulcers typically have undermined borders and may have a necrotic or purulent appearance. Extraintestinal manifestations of IBD: Erythema nodosum (A skin condition characterized by painful red nodules typically found on the shins). (Option A) Ankylosing spondylitis (Arthritis of the spine) Pancreatitis Uveitis (Inflammation of the uvea) Osteoporosis and Osteonecrosis are overall the most common extra-intestinal manifestations of IBD. Pyoderma gangrenosum is common in Ulcerative colitis. Primary Sclerosing Cholangitis is common in Ulcerative colitis. Renal calculi is common in Crohn’s disease. Diabetic ulcer (Option C) is not associated with inflammatory bowel disease. It is a complication of uncontrolled diabetes mellitus. Venous ulcer (Option D) is usually caused by conditions like long-standing varicose veins. It is usually situated around the ankles.

      "question": "A 15-year-old girl presented with fatigue, chronic diarrhoea, weight loss, bone pain and abdominal distension. Investigations revealed iron deficiency anemia and osteoporosis. Which of the following is the single best test to be done for her evaluation?",
      "options": {
        "A": "TSH levels",

        "C": "Urine sugar and ketone",
        "D": "IgA tissue transglutaminase antibody"
      },
      "correct_answer": "D",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: D) IgA tissue transglutaminase antibody Explanation: The clinical scenario of fatigue, chronic diarrhea, weight loss, bone pain, abdominal distension, iron deficiency anemia, and osteoporosis strongly indicates celiac disease . The single best test for its evaluation is the IgA tissue transglutaminase antibody. Celiac Disease: Also called celiac sprue or gluten-sensitive enteropathy. Associated with HLA-DQ2 and DQ8. Small intestinal enteropathy caused by immune response to gluten. Characterized by autoantibodies to tissue transglutaminase. Gluten is found in wheat, rye, barley, and some oats. Pathogenesis: Tissue transglutaminase deamidates glutamine residues of gluten-derived peptides, facilitating immune response. Affects the proximal small intestine. Clinical Features: Diarrhea, weight loss , growth failure (children). Bloating , irregular bowel habits, migraines, ataxia. May present with osteoporosis, iron-deficiency anemia , or abnormal liver enzymes. Diagnosis: Serum antibodies: Tissue transglutaminase IgA , anti-endomysial, deamidated anti-gliadin antibodies. Measure serum IgA levels to detect IgA deficiency. Confirmatory testing: Endoscopy with small-intestinal biopsy. Biopsy findings: Villus blunting, crypt hyperplasia, increased intraepithelial lymphocytes. Marsh classification used for severity grading. Management: Lifelong strict gluten-free diet. TSH levels (Option A): Thyroid dysfunction can cause fatigue and weight loss, but it does not explain chronic diarrhea, iron deficiency anemia, or osteoporosis. These symptoms point toward malabsorption rather than thyroid disease, making TSH an inappropriate choice in this context. C-peptide levels (Option B): C-peptide is useful in evaluating insulin secretion and distinguishing between type 1 and type 2 diabetes. However, diabetes does not typically present with chronic diarrhea, iron deficiency anemia, or osteoporosis, making it irrelevant here. Urine sugar and ketones (Option C): While this test helps identify diabetes and diabetic ketoacidosis, the patient's symptoms, such as malabsorption and nutrient deficiencies, do not suggest these conditions. Chronic diarrhea and weight loss are not hallmark features of diabetes. Reference: Harrison’s Principle of Internal Medicine, 21st Edition, Page 2463,2464",

      "explanation": "Correct Answer: B) No Free radical injury Explanation: Free radical injury due to an excess of copper ions is seen in patients with Wilson's disease. Wilson's disease Wilson's disease, also known as hepatolenticular degeneration , is a rare autosomal recessive disorder (Option A), usually presents before age 40 (Option D) with liver disease caused by the abnormal accumulation of copper in the liver, brain, eyes, and other organs. This results in elevated free copper levels, along with increased copper levels in the liver and urine, while serum ceruloplasmin levels are decreased. Gene Affected: The disease is caused by mutations in the ATP7B gene (Option C) on chromosome 13. This gene encodes a copper-transporting ATPase responsible for excreting copper from the liver into bile. Pathogenesis: Lab parameters of Wilson’s disease Parameter Change Explanation Free Copper II Increased Unbound copper elevated due to impaired binding. Liver Copper II Increased Accumulation due to defective biliary excretion. Urinary Copper II Increased Overflow from the liver leads to high excretion. Total Copper II Decreased Mainly composed of ceruloplasmin-bound copper. Serum Ceruloplasmin II Decreased Defective incorporation of copper into ceruloplasmin.",

Congestive heart failure (Option A) can also lead to the development of ascites. However, in this, the SAAG is usually greater than 1.1 g/dL. SAAG is usually greater than 1.1 g/dL in myxoedema (Option B) and Budd Chiari syndrome (Option C). Interpretations of SAAG: SAAG ≥ 1.1 g/dL: Portal hypertension (ascites is due to increased pressure in the hepatic sinusoids) Ascitic protein level ≥ 2.5 g/dL : Hepatic sinusoids are normal (allows passage of protein) Ascitic protein level <2.5 g/dL : Hepatic sinusoids are damaged and scarred (no passage of protein) SAAG <1.1 g/dL: Ascites is not related to portal hypertension.

      "explanation": "inflammation that are separated by normal or unaffected segments of the bowel. This pattern of involvement is not seen in ulcerative colitis. Skip lesions can occur throughout the entire gastrointestinal tract, from the mouth to the anus, in Crohn's disease. In Crohn's disease, the inflammation can involve all layers of the bowel wall, which is known as transmural involvement . In ulcerative colitis, the inflammation is limited to the mucosal layer of the colon and rectum. (Option B) Both Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis have a strong genetic component , indicating a predisposition to developing these conditions (Option C) . Family history of inflammatory bowel disease is a known risk factor. Crohn's disease is a chronic condition that requires long-term management and treatment (Option D) to control inflammation and maintain remission. Learning Objective: Distinguishing features between Crohn’s Disease and Ulcerative colitis Clinical features Crohn’s Disease Ulcerative colitis Affects Any part of GIT from mouth to anus. Primarily, the colon is involved. Rectal involvement The rectum is often spared. It almost always involves the rectum, hence associated with rectal bleeding.

      "question": "A patient was taking ampicillin for an upper respiratory tract infection. Then he started having watery diarrhoea for the past 3 days. Which is the drug of choice to manage this condition?",
      "options": {

        "D": "Bezlotoxumab"
      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: B) Fidaxomicin Explanation: The overuse of antibiotics like ampicillin leads to diarrhoea and further, a condition called pseudomembranous colitis caused by Clostridium difficile and is treated with Fidaxomicin . Clostridioides Difficile Infection (CDI) A colonic disease caused by C. difficile, linked to antibiotic use disrupting normal gut microbiome. It results in diarrhoea and severe cases, of pseudomembranous colitis (PMC). Etiology & Epidemiology: C. difficile is a spore-forming, anaerobic bacterium. Most commonly acquired in hospitals, nursing homes, and after antibiotic use. High-risk antibiotics: Clindamycin , Ampicillin , Cephalosporins , and Fluoroquinolones (Option C) . CDI is common in healthcare settings and can also occur in the community without prior antibiotic use. Pathogenesis: Ingestion of spores leads to toxin production (Toxin A and Toxin B) causing gut damage, diarrhoea, and PMC. Toxin B is the more important virulence factor. Diagnosis: Based on diarrhoea ( ≥ 3 unformed stools/day for ≥ 2 days). Toxin detection in stool (via PCR or enzyme immunoassays). Endoscopy can detect PMC in advanced cases. Treatment: First-line: Oral Vancomycin or Fidaxomicin Metronidazole is an alternative for mild cases . (Option A) Hydration and avoiding antiperistaltic agents are recommended. For severe cases, Oral Vancomycin is preferred, especially if the patient is seriously ill. IV Vancomycin is ineffective. Bezlotoxumab (Option D) is a monoclonal antibody against C.difficile toxin B used in recurrent pseudomembranous colitis as an adjunct with vancomycin, fidaxomicin or metronidazole. It is not the first-line treatment for this condition. Reference: Harrison’s Principles of Internal Medicine, 21st Edition, Page: 1066-1069.",

      "question": "A 42-year-old female presents with complaints of recurrent episodes of abdominal pain and cramps. An endoscopy is done and she is diagnosed with ulcerative colitis. She currently has 3-4 episodes of bloody stools per day. What is the appropriate initial treatment?",

        "D": "Bezlotoxumab"
      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: B) Sulfasalazine Explanation: Sulfasalazine is commonly used in the treatment of ulcerative colitis (inflammatory bowel disease). Sulfasalazine Anti-inflammatory Properties: Sulfasalazine is composed of two components: Sulfapyridine and 5-aminosalicylic acid (5-ASA) . The 5-ASA component is responsible for the drug's anti-inflammatory effects. It inhibits the production of inflammatory mediators such as prostaglandins and leukotrienes, which play a role in the inflammation seen in ulcerative colitis. Immunomodulatory Effects: Sulfasalazine also has immunomodulatory effects, which help to regulate the immune response in the gastrointestinal tract. By modulating the activity of immune cells such as macrophages and T cells, sulfasalazine can reduce inflammation. Antibacterial Activity: Sulfasalazine's sulfapyridine component has antibacterial properties. It acts by disrupting the metabolism of certain bacteria, particularly those in the gut microbiota. By targeting bacteria, sulfasalazine may help to restore balance to the gut microbiome. Local Action in the Colon: Sulfasalazine is administered orally, and its 5-ASA component is not absorbed systemically to a significant extent. Instead, it remains largely in the colon, where it exerts its anti-inflammatory effects directly on the inflamed tissue. This targeted action reduces the risk of systemic side effects commonly associated with corticosteroids or other systemic immunosuppressive agents. Maintenance Therapy: Sulfasalazine is often used as maintenance therapy in ulcerative colitis. It helps prevent flare-ups and maintain remission over the long term. Symptomatic Relief: In addition to its disease-modifying effects, sulfasalazine can provide symptomatic relief from the symptoms of ulcerative colitis, such as diarrhoea, abdominal pain, and rectal bleeding. Incorrect Options: Budesonide (Option A) is used in cases of exacerbation of ulcerative colitis, especially mild to moderate cases. Azathioprine (AZA) (Option C) is a medication used in the management and treatment of active rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and the prevention of kidney transplant rejection. Bezlotoxumab (Option D) is indicated to reduce the recurrence of Clostridium difficile infection (CDI) in patients who are receiving antibacterial drug treatment for CDI and are at high risk for CDI recurrence.

        "D": "Pericarditis"
      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: B) Boerhaave syndrome Explanation: Pneumomediastinum is one of the complication associated with Boerhaave syndrome , which is a condition characterized by spontaneous full-thickness rupture of the esophagus. Boerhaave syndrome clinically manifests as Mackler’s triad (Vomiting, chest pain, and subcutaneous emphysema). The condition is often preceded by forceful vomiting. This condition typically occurs in the lower third of the esophagus and results in a direct communication between the esophageal lumen and mediastinal space. The rupture allows esophageal contents to spill into the mediastinum which can occasionally lead to complications such as pneumomediastinum and chemical mediastinitis . Boerhaave syndrome Definition It is a spontaneous esophageal rupture caused by a sudden increase in intraesophageal pressure, typically from vomiting against a closed glottis resulting in a left-sided esophageal perforation , which allows gastric contents to spill into the pleural cavity, leading to a left pleural effusion and subcutaneous emphysema . Classic triad Vomiting, chest pain, and subcutaneous emphysema. (Mackler’s triad) Other Symptoms May include fever, tachycardia, and tachypnea in the presence of sepsis Physical examination Hamman’s sign (crunching sound on auscultation due to surgical emphysema). Complications Pneumothorax/ Pneumomediastinum , mediastinitis, and sepsis. Pulsion diverticulum (Option A) occurs due to increased intraluminal pressure in the esophagus, forming an outpouching of the esophageal wall. While it can cause symptoms like dysphagia and regurgitation, it does not typically result in pneumomediastinum as the esophageal wall remains intact. Mallory-Weiss syndrome (Option C) involves longitudinal mucosal tears at the gastroesophageal junction, typically following forceful vomiting. While it can cause hematemesis, the tear is superficial and does not extend through the full thickness of the esophageal wall, thus not causing pneumomediastinum. Pericarditis (Option D) is inflammation of the pericardium, the fibrous sac surrounding the heart. While it causes chest pain and other symptoms related to inflammation, it does not involve the esophagus and does not cause pneumomediastinum.

      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: A) UGIE (Upper GI Endoscopy) Explanation: The presentation of progressive dysphagia for solids with significant weight loss and cachexia in an elderly patient strongly suggests esophageal carcinoma . Upper GI endoscopy (UGIE) is the gold standard diagnostic tool in this scenario as it allows direct visualization of the tumor and enables tissue biopsy for definitive diagnosis. UGIE also permits thorough examination of the larynx, trachea, and bronchi, which is crucial as this population has a higher risk of head and neck malignancies. Additionally, CT scanning of the chest and abdomen is typically performed to assess tumor spread to mediastinal and para-aortic lymph nodes. Manometry (Option B): While manometry is useful in diagnosing esophageal motility disorders such as achalasia, it is not the appropriate first-line investigation when malignancy is suspected (Option B ruled out). Manometry cannot provide visual confirmation of tumors or allow for tissue sampling. Barium swallow (Option C) : Although barium swallow can demonstrate mucosal abnormalities and strictures, it cannot provide tissue diagnosis which is essential when malignancy is suspected (Option C ruled out). It may be used as a complementary study but should not be the primary diagnostic tool in this scenario. Barium meal follow through (Option D) : This study is primarily used to evaluate the small intestine and is not appropriate for investigating suspected esophageal pathology (Option D ruled out).

In contrast, HLA-DQ2 and HLA-DQ8 are the primary genetic markers found in almost all individuals with celiac disease. Celiac disease is an autoimmune disorder triggered by gluten ingestion in genetically predisposed individuals. It primarily affects the proximal small intestine, with the duodenum most commonly involved. In some cases, it extends to the jejunum, causing more severe symptoms. Pathophysiology: Genetics : HLA-DQ2 and HLA-DQ8 are associated with celiac disease. Immune Response : Gluten ingestion triggers inflammation in the small intestine Symptoms: Gastrointestinal : Diarrhea, abdominal pain, bloating, nausea, vomiting, steatorrhea. Extra-intestinal : Fatigue, skin rashes (dermatitis herpetiformis), weight loss, anemia, joint pain, headaches, peripheral neuropathy. In Children : Delayed growth, irritability, poor weight gain, bone issues due to malabsorption. Diagnosis: 1. Serological Testing: Tissue Transglutaminase (tTG) Antibodies: Most sensitive and specific test. (Option A ruled out) Anti-Endomysial Antibodies (EMA) Anti-Gliadin Antibodies (AGA): Less specific. (Option B ruled out) 2. Histological Confirmation: Upper gastrointestinal endoscopy with small bowel biopsy is the gold standard. Histological Changes : Villous Atrophy : Flattened villi. Crypt Hyperplasia : Increased crypt cells. Intraepithelial Lymphocytosis : Elevated lymphocytes. 3. Histological Grading (Modified Marsh Classification): (Option C ruled out) Type Definition 0 Normal duodenal biopsy I Normal mucosal architecture with increased intraepithelial lymphocytes II Hyperplastic crypts, but near normal Villi IIIa Hyperplastic crypts with partial villous atrophy IIIb Hyperplastic crypts with subtotal villous atrophy IIIc Hyperplastic crypts with total villous atrophy Treatment: Gluten-Free Diet : Lifelong, strict adherence is the only treatment. Gluten-containing foods (BROW) : Barley, Rye, Oats, Wheat. Complications: Malnutrition : Due to impaired absorption. Osteoporosis : From poor calcium and vitamin D absorption. Intestinal Lymphoma and Small Bowel Cancer : Rare but serious. Increased Risk of Autoimmune Disorders : Such as Type 1 diabetes and autoimmune thyroid disease. Feature Coeliac Sprue Whipple's Disease Tropical Sprue Description Autoimmune disorder triggered by gluten. Systemic infectious disease caused by Tropheryma whipplei. Malabsorption disorder seen in tropical regions. Cause often unknown, possibly infectious. Etiology Genetic predisposition (HLA-DQ2/DQ8). Environmental trigger: gluten (present in wheat, barley, rye) ingestion and an immune response to gliadin, a protein in gluten. Infection with Tropheryma whipplei, found in soil and sewage. Possibly due to bacterial, fungal or coronavirus infection. Clinical Features Affects mainly proximal small intestine. Intestinal Features: Chronic diarrhea or steatorrhea. Malabsorption: weight loss, vitamin deficiencies. Abdominal pain, bloating. Extraintestinal Features: Iron-deficiency anemia. Dermatitis herpetiformis (in some cases). Affects mainly distal small intestine. Intestinal Features: Chronic diarrhea. Malabsorption, weight loss. Abdominal pain and bloating. Extraintestinal Features: Arthralgia (joint pain). Fever.

      "explanation": "Correct Answer C - VIPoma The clinical manifestations indicate a VIPoma (vasoactive intestinal peptide-secreting tumor) , which is a rare neuroendocrine tumor that causes WDHA syndrome ( Watery Diarrhea, Hypokalemia, and Achlorhydria ). This condition is characterized by secretory diarrhea due to excessive VIP production, leading to profound fluid and electrolyte losses. The syndrome presents with severe watery diarrhea (up to 3L/day), resulting in dehydration, electrolyte imbalances particularly hypokalemia, and decreased gastric acid secretion (achlorhydria). The excessive VIP secretion directly causes these symptoms through its effects on intestinal and gastric secretion. VIPoma Definition: A VIPoma is a type of neuroendocrine tumour that produces vasoactive intestinal peptides (VIP). They are linked to syndromes like: Verner-Morrison syndrome. Pancreatic cholera. WDHA syndrome (watery diarrhoea, hypokalemia, achlorhydria). VIP, a 28-amino-acid peptide, mimics cholera toxin effects by: Stimulating chloride secretion in the small intestine. Increasing smooth muscle contractility. Leading to severe diarrhoea. Clinical features: Patients typically present with: Severe watery diarrhoea leads to hypokalemia and metabolic acidosis. Flushing episodes. Low stomach acid ( achlorhydria / hypochlorhydria ). Increased glycogen breakdown. Elevated calcium levels (hypercalcemia). Tumor Characteristics: Typically solitary. Often located in the pancreatic tail. Diagnosis: Elevated plasma VIP levels are common but not definitive for diagnosis, as they can occur in other conditions like: Inflammatory bowel disease. Post-surgery (small bowel resection). Radiation enteritis. Chronic laxative or diuretic use can complicate diagnosis. Treatment: Critical management includes: Fluid and electrolyte replacement to address dehydration, hypokalemia, and electrolyte losses. Long-term treatment options: Somatostatin analogues are effective in controlling diarrhoea. Surgical resection is recommended for localized tumours. Insulinoma (Option A) : An insulinoma presents with symptoms of hypoglycemia including weakness, fatigue, sweating, palpitations, confusion, and seizures. These tumors produce excess insulin, leading to low blood sugar, but do not cause the profound diarrhea and electrolyte disturbances seen in this patient. Somatostatinoma (Option B) : Somatostatinomas typically present with diabetes mellitus, cholelithiasis, diarrhea, and steatorrhea due to somatostatin's inhibitory effects on digestive enzyme secretion. While diarrhea can occur, the complete WDHA syndrome is not a feature of this tumor. Glucagonoma (Option D) : Glucagonomas are characterized by necrolytic migratory erythema, diabetes mellitus, weight loss, and anemia. They do not typically cause the severe secretory diarrhea and electrolyte abnormalities seen in this case. Reference: Harrison’s Principles of Internal Medicine, 21st edition, Page: 665.

Incorrect options: Option A. Burns : Burns are not typically associated with the development of Cushing's ulcers. Gastric ulcers in burn patients are more commonly attributed to other factors such as stress, decreased mucosal blood flow, and altered acid secretion. Option B. Stress : While stress can contribute to the development of gastric ulcers, it is not specific to Cushing's ulcers. Stress-related ulcers, also known as stress ulcers, can occur in various conditions such as severe illness, trauma, surgery, or critical illness. Option D.

      "explanation": "lactose, a sugar found in dairy products caused due to deficiency of lactase responsible to breakdown lactose. Yogurt is produced through the fermentation of milk by bacteria, typically Lactobacillus and Streptococcus species. During the fermentation process, these bacteria produce lactase, which helps break down lactose into simpler sugars. As a result, yogurt contains lower levels of lactose compared to other dairy products. Incorrect Options : Option A - Condensed Milk: Condensed milk is milk from which water has been removed, resulting in a concentrated form. It contains a high concentration of lactose, and therefore, is likely to cause symptoms of lactose intolerance in individuals with lactase deficiency. Option B - Skimmed Milk: Skimmed milk refers to milk from which the cream (high-fat portion) has been removed. While the fat content is reduced, lactose content remains relatively unchanged. Therefore, skimmed milk can still cause symptoms of lactose intolerance in individuals with lactase deficiency. Option D - Ice Cream: Ice cream is a dairy product that typically contains high amounts of lactose. Therefore, ice cream is likely to cause symptoms of lactose intolerance in individuals with lactase deficiency. Reference: .",

      },
      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "present for 10 years This statement is generally true. Patients with ulcerative colitis have an increased risk of developing colorectal cancer compared to the general population. The risk is directly related to the duration of the disease. It is estimated that after 10 years of ulcerative colitis, the cumulative risk of developing colorectal cancer is around 2%. However, it is important to note that individual risks can vary depending on other factors such as disease severity, extent, and presence of dysplasia. Incorrect options: Option A - Bad prognosis if it involved only rectum This statement is not entirely accurate. While rectal involvement can increase the risk of cancer development, the prognosis is determined by multiple factors and cannot be solely based on the involvement of the rectum. Option B - Good prognosis if it involves only rectum and is low grade- This statement is partially correct. The prognosis of colorectal cancer in ulcerative colitis can vary based on multiple factors, including the extent and grade of the cancer. However, other factors such as the presence of dysplasia, depth of invasion, and lymph node involvement also play a role in determining prognosis. Option D - Young age onset has low chances as compared to old age onset- This statement is not entirely accurate. Young age onset does not guarantee a low chance of developing cancer, and regular surveillance and monitoring are important regardless of age.
