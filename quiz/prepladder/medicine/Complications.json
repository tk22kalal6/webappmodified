      "explanation": "antibiotics Correct Answer: A) Administer intravenous terlipressin followed by prophylactic intravenous antibiotics Explanation: In acute variceal bleeding, the initial management should include: Terlipressin : This vasopressin analogue reduces portal hypertension by causing splanchnic vasoconstriction, effectively controlling bleeding from varices. Other vasoactive drugs used in controlling variceal bleeding are Octreotide and Somatostatin. Prophylactic Antibiotics : Administering antibiotics helps prevent infections like spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP), which can complicate variceal bleeding.

      "correct_answer": "D",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: D) Lactulose Explanation: In this clinical scenario, the patient is likely experiencing hepatic encephalopathy due to elevated ammonia levels associated with alcoholic cirrhosis. The most appropriate initial treatment to lower ammonia is Lactulose. It is a nonabsorbable disaccharide that acidifies the colon , converting ammonia (NH3) into ammonium (NH4+). It aids in removing nitrogenous products from the gut that contribute to encephalopathy and acts as a laxative. Hepatic Encephalopathy Etiopathogenesis It is a complication of chronic liver disease that leads to impaired brain function as a result of liver failure. It is also called as portosystemic encephalopathy. Ammonia is a gut-derived neurotoxin that is not detoxified into urea and bypasses the liver due to portosystemic shunting and decreased hepatic mass , allowing it to enter the bloodstream and impact the brain. Types Type A is caused by acute liver failure & cerebral oedema is a common side effect of this type. Type B is caused by portosystemic shunting (can be due to TIPS also ) Type C is due to chronic liver failure. Clinical manifestations Grade 0 - alterations are seen in neuropsychological tests, but only minimal symptomatic changes are evident in Short-term memory, Reaction time or Concentration. Grade 1: Mood changes like anxiety, euphoria; Memory trouble, Trivial lack of awareness, Difficulty with addition and subtraction, Impaired sleep pattern. Grade 2: Personality changes Lethargy & apathy Behavior changes Dysarthria Disorientation for time Grade 3: Severe confusion, delirium Disorientation to place Drowsiness Bizarre behavior Asterixis Grade 4: Coma (total loss of consciousness) Grade 0,1 are considered convert or minimal hepatic encephalopathy, and grades 2,3,4 are overt hepatic encephalopathy with evident symptoms.

      "correct_answer": "D",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: D) Complete blood count. Explanation: A Complete Blood Count (CBC) is essential in evaluating Systemic Inflammatory Response Syndrome (SIRS) as it helps identify leukocytosis (elevated white blood cell count), which is one of the diagnostic criteria for SIRS. SIRS (Systemic Inflammatory Response Syndrome): A sepsis-like condition associated with systemic inflammation that can be triggered by various non-microbial factors (burns, trauma, infections). Criteria for diagnosis: 2 or more of the following components should be present to confirm the diagnosis of SIRS. Component Range Temperature (fever) Hyperthermia (fever) >38°C (>100.4°F) or Hypothermia <36°C (<96.8°F) Leukocyte (white blood cell) count Leukocytosis >12,000/ µ L Leukopenia <4000/ µ L Respiratory rate or ABG showing Tachypnea (>20 breaths per minute) or partial pressure of CO2 less than 32 mmHg, respectively. Heart rate Tachycardia (>90 breaths per minute) Blood culture (Option A) is performed to check for sepsis. If SIRS is left untreated, it can progress to sepsis, indicated by a positive blood culture in addition to SIRS. Urine culture (Option B) and Urine routine microscopy (Option C) can also be helpful in management, but they are not included in the criteria for SIRS.

      "explanation": "≥ 1.1 g/dL and <2.5 g/dL Correct Answer: B) ≥ 1.1 g/dL and <2.5 g/dL Explanation: The patient likely has ascites due to portal hypertension , commonly associated with cirrhosis from chronic alcoholism and hepatitis C. In such cases, the serum-ascites albumin gradient (SAAG ) is typically ≥ 1.1 g/dL, indicating portal hypertension. The ascitic protein level is usually <2.5 g/dL, reflecting low protein transudative fluid associated with cirrhosis. The SAAG reflects hepatic sinusoidal pressure and correlates with the hepatic venous pressure gradient, calculated by subtracting the ascitic albumin from the serum albumin (there is no effect of diuresis). Interpretations: SAAG ≥ 1.1 g/dL: Portal hypertension (ascites is due to increased pressure in the hepatic sinusoids) Ascitic protein level ≥ 2.5 g/dL : Hepatic sinusoids are normal (allows passage of protein) Ascitic protein level <2.5 g/dL : Hepatic sinusoids are damaged and scarred (no passage of protein) SAAG <1.1 g/dL: Ascites is not related to portal hypertension.

        "D": "All of the above"
      },
      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: C) Puddle sign Explanation: With small volumes of ascitic fluid (120 mL), the puddle sign is the most detectable indicator, assessed in the sitting position. The fluid thrill and shifting dullness require larger volumes to be reliably observed. Thus, the puddle sign is the most significant finding in this case. Ascites is defined as an accumulation of free fluid in the peritoneal cavity. Normal peritoneal fluid is nil. For females, peritoneal fluid can be 10-20 ml during the mid-ovulatory cycle. Clinical manifestations Initially asymptomatic Approximately 1-2 litres of fluid show signs and symptoms, including: Abdominal distension, discomfort, pain. Weight gain (sudden) Nausea, vomiting Respiratory distress having shortness of breath, dyspnea Edema of body parts Everted umbilicus (due to an increase in ascitic fluid) Clinical signs: Puddle sign (Peritoneal fluid >100ml) (Option C) The puddle sign detects small amounts of fluid in the abdomen. In a sitting position, tapping the abdomen produces a distinct sound over fluid, indicating ascites. Shifting dullness (peritoneal fluid >500ml) (Option B) In a supine position, a healthcare provider percusses the abdomen to identify dullness (fluid) and resonance (air). When the patient turns to one side, the fluid shifts, causing dullness to move to the dependent side and resonance to appear on the upper side, indicating ascitic fluid. Fluid thrill or fluid wave test (Option A) The fluid thrill is a sign of large abdominal fluid volumes (more than 1.5 Liters). It occurs when a provider taps one side of the abdomen while feeling the opposite, creating a wave indicating ascites. Hepatic hydrothorax Fluid from the abdomen, usually due to cirrhosis, accumulates in the pleural cavity, typically on the right side, causing shortness of breath and chest discomfort. Abdominal compartment syndrome (intra-abdominal hypertension) can occur if the pressure due to ascites is more than 25 mm Hg.",

        "D": "Induce cytokine production"
      },
      "correct_answer": "D",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: D) Induce cytokine production. Explanation: The clinical presentation suggests alcoholic cirrhosis , indicated by symptoms, an elevated AST/ALT ratio, and nodular liver on ultrasound. Kupffer cells , activated by alcohol metabolites and reactive oxygen species, release pro-inflammatory cytokines (e.g., TNF- α , interleukins), which stimulate hepatic stellate cells, leading to fibrosis and micronodular cirrhosis. ALD presents as micronodular cirrhosis in the early stages, which may progress to a mixed pattern of micronodular and macronodular cirrhosis in the later stages. Perivenular/pericellular (chicken wire) fibrosis can be observed in the early-stage histopathology of ALD. Pathogenesis of Alcoholic Cirrhosis: Enzymes that help in metabolising alcohol in the liver : Cytosolic ADH, Microsomal ethanol oxidising system (MEOS) Peroxisomal catalase Alcohol is metabolised to acetaldehyde by cytosolic alcohol dehydrogenase , which will cause reactive oxygen species to contribute to liver cell damage. (Option C) In chronic alcohol consumption, There is reduced fatty acid oxidation and lipoprotein secretion, leading to increased fatty acid uptake , which causes intracellular accumulation of triglycerides. (Option B) The MEOS pathway activates CYP2E1, resulting in increased production of reactive oxygen species and more acetaldehyde, which is converted to acetate by aldehyde dehydrogenase . (Option A) Peroxisomal catalase protects cells from oxidative stress and maintains cellular integrity by neutralising effect. Alcoholic liver disease is a reversible condition if timely intervention occurs and alcohol consumption is discontinued. Alcohol liver disease is the most common condition leading to cirrhosis in India. Causes of Cirrhosis 1. Micronodular Cirrhosis: Characterised by uniform nodules <3 mm in size. Commonly associated with: Alcoholic Liver Disease Chronic Biliary Obstruction and Cholangitis: Primary Biliary Cholangitis (PBC) Secondary Biliary Cholangitis Hemochromatosis Non-cirrhotic Portal Fibrosis (NCPF) 2. Macronodular Cirrhosis: Characterised by variable nodules >3 mm in size. Associated with: Viral Hepatitis: Hepatitis B Hepatitis C Hepatitis D Autoimmune Hepatitis Non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) (linked to obesity and metabolic syndrome) Wilson Disease Alpha-1 Antitrypsin Deficiency Cystic Fibrosis Cryptogenic Cirrhosis",

This is diagnosed as portal hypertension , with Doppler ultrasound being the investigation of choice. Investigations of Portal Hypertension: Investigation Purpose/Findings Ultrasonography Visualises features like splenomegaly and collateral vessels; can identify causes like liver disease or portal vein thrombosis. Doppler Ultrasound Investigation of choice to measure pressure gradient. Hepatic venous pressure gradient (HVPG) > 5 mm Hg indicates portal hypertension. Blood Counts (CBC) (Option B ruled out) First biochemical sign is thrombocytopenia (due to hypersplenism). It also shows leukopenia and anaemia. Endoscopy (Option A ruled out) Used to check for gastro-oesophageal varices. CT and MRI Scan (Option A ruled out) Assess the extent of portal vein thrombosis and evaluate hepatic vein patency. HVPG Measurement It is rarely performed by interventional radiology to measure hepatic venous pressure gradient directly.

      "explanation": "Correct Answer: B) Splenomegaly Explanation: The patient’s history of chronic alcohol use, along with symptoms like abdominal swelling and an HVPG over 5 mm Hg, suggests portal hypertension , which occurs when there is increased pressure within the portal venous system. Splenomegaly is one of the earliest signs of portal hypertension , caused by congestion in the splenic vein due to increased portal pressure. Clinical manifestations: Splenomegaly (earliest clinical sign) , leading to hypersplenism (Option B) Ascites (increased splenic vein pressure) Puddle sign is positive (When the examiner taps one side of the abdomen while the patient is upright, a wave of fluid can be felt on the opposite side, suggesting fluid accumulation). (Option A) Shifting dullness (When a patient lies supine, the examiner percusses for dullness to indicate fluid. Turning the patient to one side causes the fluid to shift, making the dull area resonant, which confirms free fluid presence). Fluid thrill (Tapping one side of the abdomen while placing a hand on the opposite side; if a wave of fluid is felt, it suggests free fluid in the cavity) Esophageal varices (pressure of >12 mmHg) Coffee ground vomitus (coffee ground like black vomit due to hematemesis) (Option C) Portal Hypertension: Portal hypertension is defined as the elevation of the hepatic venous pressure gradient (HVPG) to more than 5 mmHg.

      "correct_answer": "D",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: D) Transient elastography Explanation: Transient elastography, also called fibroscan , uses a specialised ultrasound device to measure liver stiffness by emitting a series of low-frequency vibrations (or shear waves) into the liver . Non-invasive investigations for Cirrhosis Fibrotest This test assesses specific blood markers to determine cirrhosis, Blood markers: Bilirubin Gamma-glutamyl transferase (GGT) Haptoglobin Apolipoprotein A α 2 - Macroglobulin, Serum electrophoresis In chronic liver disease, this shows decreased albumin and elevated γ Globulin. Live function test LFTs are commonly used for screening liver health. In chronic hepatitis, both ALT and AST are elevated, with ALT typically greater than AST (ALT > AST). These tests also evaluate vital parameters such as bilirubin and albumin to assess liver function. Computed Tomography (Option A) can provide detailed images of liver morphology and help identify lesions; it does not measure liver stiffness directly. Its primary use is in detecting structural abnormalities rather than evaluating fibrosis. Ultrasound (Option B) is used as an initial investigation. It provides information on liver morphology and assesses complications like portal hypertension. It can provide general information about liver conditions but lacks the specificity for assessing fibrosis levels. Magnetic resonance imaging (Option C) is useful for visualising liver anatomy and detecting lesions; however, like CT scans, it does not directly measure liver stiffness.

Decompensated cirrhosis: Patients developing complications due to cirrhosis are considered to have decompensated cirrhosis. Prognosis of patients with this condition is poor . Complications of cirrhosis: Ascites, variceal bleed, jaundice Splenomegaly Portal HTN Coagulopathy Bacterial peritonitis Hepatic encephalopathy Hepatorenal syndrome Hepatopulmonary syndrome Compensated cirrhosis: It is the early stage of cirrhosis, where the liver is significantly damaged yet still performs most essential functions. Patients often remain asymptomatic or experience only mild symptoms due to the liver's compensatory mechanisms. Type of cirrhosis Ascites Varices Death by 1 year Compensated cirrhosis Stage 1 No No 1% Stage 2 No Yes 3% Decompensated cirrhosis Stage 3 Yes Yes 20 % Stage 4 Yes Yes (+/- Bleeding) 57% Alcoholic hepatitis (Option B) is an inflammatory liver condition caused by excessive alcohol consumption , resulting in jaundice, abdominal pain, and liver dysfunction. While it can lead to cirrhosis, the patient's chronic hepatitis C history is more consistent with decompensated cirrhosis based on the current clinical presentation. Acute liver failure (Option C) is a rapid decline in liver function over days or weeks, usually in individuals without pre-existing liver diseas e. It can result from acetaminophen overdose, viral hepatitis, drug-induced liver injury, or metabolic disorders. However, the chronic history of hepatitis C does not align with an acute presentation.
