She reports passing loose stools up to 10 times per day and has noticed blood in her stool intermittently. A colonoscopy was done, which showed continuous involvement and mucosal erythema of the rectum with pseudopolyps and barium enema, and a lead pipe appearance was found.

      },
      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "colonoscopy findings of rectal involvement , and pseudopolyps and barium enema finding of lead pipe appearance is suggestive of ulcerative colitis. It is a type of chronic inflammatory bowel disease characterized by the involvement of the rectum/rectosigmoid junction in most cases. There is inflammation of the rectum , causing frequent bloody diarrhoea, lower abdominal pain, fatigue, and weight loss. Retrograde inflammation can occur, 2-3 cm into the terminal ileum, causing backwash ileitis . 20% of the cases can have pancolitis (the entire colon is involved). Endoscopic findings Microscopic findings The colonic mucosa may be slightly red and granular or have extensive, broad-based ulcers. Fine mucosal granularity can be seen. Similar to Crohn’s disease. They include inflammatory infiltrates , crypt abscesses , crypt distortion, and pseudo pyloric epithelial metaplasia. Isolated islands of regenerating mucosa often bulge into the lumen to create pseudopolyps , and the tips of these polyps may fuse to create mucosal bridges. Granulomas are absent in ulcerative colitis (differentiating it from Crohn’s disease). Chronic disease may lead to mucosal atrophy with a smooth mucosal surface that lacks normal folds. The diffuse inflammation is generally limited to the mucosa and superficial submucosa. Ulcerative colitis is not transmural . As a result, the colon wall is not thickened, the serosal surface is normal, and strictures do not occur. In severe cases, extensive mucosal destruction may be accompanied by ulcers that extend into the submucosa, but the muscularis propria is rarely involved. Collar button ulcers are seen. They are small, deep ulcers where the button corresponds to the eroded ulcer base and the button neck corresponds to the undermined and preserved mucosa. Crohn’s disease (Option A) also presents with lower abdominal pain, diarrhoea with blood or mucus, fatigue, and weight loss. Its endoscopic and microscopic findings are mentioned below.

      "explanation": "form of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) that primarily affects the colon and rectum. Routes of Administration: Rectal administration: For patients with mild to moderate UC limited to the rectum or distal colon, 5-ASA is available in rectal formulations such as suppositories or enemas. These formulations allow direct delivery of the medication to the inflamed areas, providing targeted therapy and faster symptom relief, but compliance is low. Oral administration: For more extensive disease involvement or when rectal administration alone is insufficient, oral formulations of 5-ASA are used. Inducing remission : During active flares of UC, 5-ASA is often used to induce remission. It helps reduce inflammation in the colon and rectum, thereby alleviating symptoms such as diarrhoea, rectal bleeding, abdominal pain, and urgency. Maintenance therapy : Once remission is achieved, 5-ASA is often continued as maintenance therapy to prevent relapse and maintain long-term remission. Long-term use of 5-ASA has been shown to reduce the frequency and severity of flares in patients with UC. Combination therapy: In some cases, 5-ASA may be used in combination with other medications such as corticosteroids (Option D ruled out) , immunomodulators, or biologic agents, particularly in patients with moderate to severe UC who do not respond adequately to 5-ASA alone. Anti-TNF alpha inhibitors (infliximab (Option C ruled out), adalimumab) can be used as anti-inflammatories. Azathioprine is used as a steroid-sparing agent. (Option B ruled out) Safety profile: 5-ASA is generally well-tolerated, with the most common adverse effects being gastrointestinal symptoms such as nausea, abdominal pain, and diarrhoea . Serious adverse effects may include allergic reactions, pancreatitis, or kidney problems. Surgery is recommended for patients who do not improve after medical treatment or with toxic megacolon and perforation. Indications for elective surgery include: Failure of medical therapy. Growth retardation. Extraintestinal disease. Malignant change.

      "question": "A 35-year-old man presented with bloody diarrhoea, abdominal pain and tenesmus for the past two weeks. On colonoscopy, pseudopolyps were noted in the colon. Which of the following drugs can be used in this condition?",
      "options": {
        "A": "Sulphadoxine",
        "B": "Sulfamethoxazole",
        "C": "Sulfinpyrazone",
        "D": "Sulfasalazine"
      },
      "correct_answer": "D",
      "explanation": "Correct answer: D) Sulfasalazine Explanation: Bloody diarrhoea, abdominal pain, tenesmus, and pseudopolyps are suggestive of ulcerative colitis. Sulfasalazine is commonly used in the treatment of ulcerative colitis (inflammatory bowel disease). Anti-inflammatory Properties: Sulfasalazine is composed of two components: sulfapyridine and 5-aminosalicylic acid (5-ASA) . The 5-ASA component is responsible for the drug's anti-inflammatory effects. It inhibits the production of inflammatory mediators such as prostaglandins and leukotrienes, which play a role in the inflammation seen in ulcerative colitis. Immunomodulatory Effects: Sulfasalazine also has immunomodulatory effects, which help to regulate the immune response in the gastrointestinal tract. By modulating the activity of immune cells such as macrophages and T cells, sulfasalazine can reduce inflammation. Antibacterial Activity: Sulfasalazine's sulfapyridine component has antibacterial properties. It acts by disrupting the metabolism of certain bacteria, particularly those in the gut microbiota. By targeting bacteria, sulfasalazine may help to restore balance to the gut microbiome. Local Action in the Colon: Sulfasalazine is administered orally, and its 5-ASA component is not absorbed systemically to a significant extent. Instead, it remains largely in the colon, where it exerts its anti-inflammatory effects directly on the inflamed tissue. This targeted action reduces the risk of systemic side effects commonly associated with corticosteroids or other systemic immunosuppressive agents. Maintenance Therapy: Sulfasalazine is often used as maintenance therapy in ulcerative colitis. It helps prevent flare-ups and maintain remission over the long term. Symptomatic Relief: In addition to its disease-modifying effects, sulfasalazine can provide symptomatic relief from the symptoms of ulcerative colitis, such as diarrhoea, abdominal pain, and rectal bleeding. Sulphadoxine (Option A) is an antimalarial and antimicrobial used with pyrimethamine; not indicated in IBD. Sulfamethoxazole (Option B) is an antibiotic commonly combined with trimethoprim (as co-trimoxazole); also not useful in IBD. Sulfinpyrazone (Option C) is a uricosuric agent used in gout; not relevant for ulcerative colitis.

      "explanation": "disease patients, contributing to symptom improvement. They are most commonly advised as a first-line non-pharmacological treatment in the management of Crohn's disease. Dietary advice for Crohn's disease: Low-Residue Diet (Option A ruled out): Limiting high-fibre foods, such as whole grains, nuts, seeds, and raw fruits and vegetables, can help reduce bowel irritation and minimize digestive symptoms. Avoid Trigger Foods (Option B ruled out): Identify and avoid foods that trigger symptoms, such as spicy foods, dairy products (if lactose intolerant), caffeine, and high-fat or high-sugar foods. Probiotics (Option C): Incorporate probiotic-rich foods, such as yoghurt with live cultures or probiotic supplements, to help restore a healthy balance of gut bacteria and reduce inflammation. This is considered the single most important measure. Small, Frequent Meals (Option D ruled out) : Smaller, more frequent meals rather than large meals to ease digestion and reduce strain on the digestive system. Nutrient-rich foods : Nutrient-dense foods that are gentle on the digestive tract, such as lean proteins (chicken, fish), cooked vegetables, fruits without seeds or skins, and easily digestible grains (white rice, oatmeal). Limit Alcohol and Smoking: Minimize alcohol consumption and avoid smoking, as these habits can exacerbate Crohn's disease symptoms and contribute to inflammation.

      "question": "A 28-year-old female presents with recurrent and persistent abdominal pain, diarrhoea, and weight loss. She has a history of Crohn's disease confirmed by colonoscopy and biopsy. There is no fistulization present on colonoscopy. Despite initial treatment with mesalamine, her symptoms have not improved significantly. Which of the following treatment options is most appropriate as a next step in managing her Crohn's disease?",
      "options": {
        "A": "Corticosteroids",
        "B": "Azathioprine",
        "C": "Infliximab",
        "D": "Methotrexate"
      },
      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "mesalamine fail to adequately control symptoms. Anti-TNF therapy, such as infliximab, is a recommended next step for patients with moderate to severe Crohn's disease who do not respond to conventional medications like mesalamine. Anti-TNF agents target tumour necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), an inflammatory cytokine involved in Crohn's disease pathogenesis, and can induce and maintain remission in affected individuals. A step-wise approach to treatment strategies for Crohn's disease: Mild Disease Management: Start with 5-aminosalicylic acid (5-ASA) medications like mesalamine. These can help reduce inflammation in the gut. Moderate to Severe Disease Management: For patients who don't respond well to corticosteroids or need longer-term treatment, immunomodulators like azathioprine, mercaptopurine, or methotrexate may be used. These medications work by suppressing the immune system to reduce inflammation. Biological Therapies: Biological agents, such as anti-TNF drugs like infliximab, adalimumab, or certolizumab, are often considered for patients with moderate to severe Crohn's disease who haven't responded to other treatments. These drugs target specific proteins in the immune system to reduce inflammation. Combination Therapy: In some cases, a combination of medications may be used to achieve better control of symptoms and reduce the risk of complications. For example, combining an immunomodulator with a biological agent may be effective for certain patients. Nutritional Therapy: Nutritional therapy, including enteral nutrition (liquid diets) or specific dietary modifications, may be recommended as adjunctive therapy or for maintenance of remission in some patients, especially children or those with specific nutritional needs. Surgery: Surgery may be necessary for complications of Crohn's disease, such as strictures, fistulas, or abscesses that don't respond to medical treatment. Surgery aims to remove affected portions of the intestine or repair damaged tissues. Corticosteroids (Option A), like prednisone, are potent anti-inflammatory medications used in Crohn's disease, especially during flare-ups or when rapid symptom relief is needed. However, they are typically reserved for short-term use due to potential side effects with long-term use, such as weight gain, bone density loss, and increased infection risk. Azathioprine (Option B) is an immunosuppressive medication often used as an adjunctive therapy for Crohn's disease. Azathioprine is particularly beneficial for patients who require maintenance therapy to prevent disease flares and helps to maintain remission. Methotrexate (Option D) is another immunosuppressive agent used in Crohn's disease management, especially in cases where other medications have not been effective or are not tolerated.
