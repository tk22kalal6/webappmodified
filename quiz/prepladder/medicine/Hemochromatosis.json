      "explanation": "Correct Answer: C) Defective biliary excretion of copper Explanation: Wilson's disease is a genetic disorder of copper metabolism due to defective biliary excretion of copper caused by mutations in the ATP7B gene. This leads to copper buildup, primarily in the liver, causing hepatocellular damage, as seen with elevated liver enzymes, hepatomegaly, and jaundice. Excess copper also deposits in the brain, resulting in neurological symptoms like tremors and cognitive impairment. Diagnosis is further supported by elevated copper levels, decreased ceruloplasmin levels and presence of Kayser-Fleischer rings, which are copper deposits found in the cornea. Wilson's disease Wilson's disease, also known as hepatolenticular degeneration, is a rare autosomal recessive disorder caused by the abnormal accumulation of copper in the liver, brain, eyes, and other organs. This results in elevated free copper levels, along with increased copper levels in the liver and urine, while serum",

      "explanation": "Correct Answer: B) Basal ganglia Explanation: The clinical scenario described is consistent with Wilson's disease, affecting the liver and brain. The neurological symptoms, such as tremors, dystonia, and personality changes, are primarily due to copper deposition in the basal ganglia, involved in the regulation of movement and coordination. The basal ganglia's dysfunction leads to the movement disorders and psychiatric symptoms observed in affected individuals, while the liver damage results in elevated liver enzymes and jaundice. Clinical Features of Wilson's Disease Hepatic Symptoms Chronic Hepatitis: Jaundice, hepatomegaly, elevated liver enzymes due to copper accumulation in the liver. Cirrhosis: Portal hypertension, variceal bleeding as a result of long-term copper accumulation and fibrosis. Acute Liver Failure: Coagulopathy, jaundice, encephalopathy. Neurological Symptoms Movement Disorders: Tremors (flapping or wind-beating tremor), dystonia, ataxia, dysarthria due to copper accumulation in the basal ganglia. Parkinsonism: Rigidity, bradykinesia, cogwheel rigidity from copper accumulation in the basal ganglia. Psychiatric: Depression, personality changes, cognitive decline.

      "explanation": "Correct Answer: A) Serum copper levels Explanation: In Wilson's disease, the accumulation of copper in organs like the liver and brain leads to its characteristic symptoms. Serum copper levels are often low due to reduced ceruloplasmin (the copper-carrying protein), but this is not a reliable diagnostic marker as it can be affected by other conditions. Investigations of Wilson's disease Test Findings Biochemical Tests Serum Ceruloplasmin: Decreased (<20 mg/dL) - Indicates low levels of the copper-carrying protein due to defective copper transport in Wilson's disease. Free Serum Copper: Increased (toxic unbound copper), reflects elevated free copper levels as it is not effectively bound to ceruloplasmin. Note: This test is not definitive for Wilson's disease because elevated free copper can occur in other conditions as well, such as liver disease or acute inflammation. 24-Hour Urinary Copper Excretion: Elevated (>100 µg/24h), A reliable indicator of copper overload, often used for diagnosis and monitoring treatment. (Option D) Liver Biopsy Copper Content in Liver Tissue: Elevated (>250 µg/g dry weight), Definitive test for Wilson's disease, measuring accumulated copper in hepatocytes. (Option C ruled out) Genetic Testing Mutation analysis of ATP7B gene: Confirms the diagnosis; Useful in uncertain cases or for family screening.

      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: A) Penicillamine Explanation: Penicillamine is a chelating agent that effectively binds copper, facilitating its excretion through the kidneys and reducing copper accumulation in the body. It is particularly indicated for symptomatic patients with neurological or hepatic manifestations. Management of Wilson’s Disease Chelation Therapy: Penicillamine: The first-line chelating agent that binds copper and promotes its excretion in urine. Dosage is usually started at low levels to avoid worsening of neurological symptoms. Given along with pyridoxine or vitamin B6 (counter deficiency). Trientine (Option B): Another chelating agent used for patients intolerant to penicillamine. It is less likely to cause side effects and is as effective. Zinc Acetate (Option C): Inhibits copper absorption from the gastrointestinal tract and is often used for maintenance therapy after initial chelation. Dietary Copper Restriction: Avoid foods high in copper, such as shellfish, liver, nuts, chocolate, and mushrooms. Symptomatic and Supportive Therapy: Liver Transplantation: Indicated in cases of fulminant liver failure or decompensated cirrhosis. Transplantation corrects the underlying metabolic defect as the new liver has a functional ATP7B gene. Symptomatic treatment of neurological features: Physical therapy for movement disorders and psychiatric care for behavioral changes. Note: Dimercaprol (Option D): Although a chelating agent, it is primarily used for the treatment of heavy metal poisoning (e.g., lead, mercury) Reference: Harrison's principles of internal medicine, 21st Edition, Page 3236,3237.

      },
      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: C) NAZER score of 9; liver transplantation is indicated Explanation: The NAZER index in the above scenario is calculated as follows: Serum bilirubin: 12 mg/dL = score 3 Serum aspartate transferase (AST): 250 IU/L = score 3 Prothrombin time prolongation: 15 seconds = score 3 Total score = 9. A score of 9 or more indicates the need for liver transplantation in this patient. Liver transplantation in Wilson’s disease: Liver transplantation is an effective treatment for patients with Wilson disease who have end-stage liver disease or acute liver failure, showing excellent postoperative survival rates, especially in younger patients without recurrence. A tailored approach for evaluating liver transplant candidates with Wilson disease and managing their care during the waiting period is proposed, emphasising the complexities of this systemic condition. Different scores and systems are in place to evaluate a candidate for liver transplantation. NAZER prognostic index: This index is used to calculate the prognosis of the liver disease and determine the need for liver transplantation. Laboratory measurement Score (in points) Normal value 0 1 2 3 4 Serum bilirubin 0.2-1.2 mg/dL <5.8 5.8-8.8 8.8-11.7 11.7-17.5 >17.5 Serum aspartate transferase 10-35 IU/L <100 100-150 151-200 201-300 >300 Prolongation of prothrombin time (seconds) <4 4-8 9-12 13-20 >20 A failed medical treatment indicates the need for liver transplantation. It is indicated in a patient with acute liver failure due to Wilson disease with a NAZER prognostic score of 9 or more. Child-Pugh score: The prognosis of chronic liver disease can be assessed using the Child-Pugh score. It uses five clinical measures, each measure is given scores from 1-3 according to the grades, and interpreted as follows: Factor Points toward total score 1 2 3 S. bilirubin (mg/dL) <2 2-3 >3 S. albumin (g/dL) >3.5 3-3.5 <3 Prothrombin time (seconds) Or INR <4 <1.7 4-6 1.7-2.3 >6 >2.3 Ascites None Easily controlled Poorly controlled Hepatic encephalopathy None Minimal Advanced Category Points Description Class A 5 to 6 Well-preserved liver function Class B 7 to 9 Moderate liver function Class C 10 to 15 Severe liver dysfunction with a life expectancy of approximately one year Transplantation is indicated in patients with a score >/= 7, i.e., of categories B and C.

      "explanation": "Correct Answer: A) Type 1 Explanation: The clinical scenario points to the diagnosis of Type 1 hereditary hemochromatosis as the patient has both C282/H63D mutations along with a family history . Hemochromatosis Hemochromatosis is a common inherited disorder of iron metabolism, particularly prevalent in European populations. It is characterised by genetic variability but ultimately leads to excessive iron release into cells, resulting in increased intestinal iron absorption and tissue damage. Definition : Hemochromatosis refers to a group of genetic disorders that predispose individuals to iron overload, potentially causing organ damage and failure. Types of hemochromatosis : Hereditary hemochromatosis Secondary Type 1 (Option A) HFE-related C282Y homozygosity C282/H63D compound heterozygosity Iron-loading anemias Thalassemia major Siderroblastioc anemia Chronic hemolytic anemias Transfusion and parenteral iron overload Dietary iron overload Type-2 (Option B) Non-HFE related Juvenile hemochromatosis Chronic liver disease Hepatitis C Alcoholic cirrhosis Nonalcoholic steatohepatitis Porphyria cutanea tarda Dysmerabolic iron overload syndrome Post-porta caval shunting Type-3 (Option C) Mutated transferrin receptor 2 (TRF2) Type-4 (Option D) Mutated ferroportin 1 gene Pathophysiology: Hereditary hemochromatosis: Iron metabolism disruption: Normal body iron content is approximately 3–4 g. In hemochromatosis, intestinal iron absorption exceeds body needs, leading to ≥ 4 mg/d absorption. Iron accumulation: The excess iron accumulates in plasma, increasing transferrin saturation and plasma ferritin levels. Role of hepcidin (HEP atic bacterio CID al prote IN) : Hepcidin, a liver-derived peptide, regulates iron absorption and release by binding to ferroportin. HFE, TFR2, and hemojuvelin influence hepcidin production, and any mutations lead to reduced hepcidin and increased iron absorption. Genetic basis: A common mutation in the HFE gene (C282Y) impairs cell surface expression and reduces hepcidin production, leading to increased dietary iron absorption. Advanced disease can result in iron levels exceeding 20 g, deposited primarily in the liver, pancreas, and heart. Secondary iron overload: Conditions like sideroblastic anemia and thalassemia lead to increased iron absorption and can result in similar complications as hemochromatosis. Iron overload in porphyria cutanea tarda (PCT) may exacerbate existing enzyme deficiencies. Environmental Factors: Excessive iron ingestion over the years is a rare cause, but notable cases include individuals consuming iron from brewing vessels. Long-term medicinal iron use can lead to hemochromatosis in genetically predisposed individuals. Reference: Harrison’s Principles of Internal Medicine, 21st edition, Page: 3230, 3232.",

      "explanation": "Correct Answer: C) Arthropathy Explanation: The scenario here is of hemochromatosis where excess iron is seen in the blood and as deposits in the tissues and also in joints, leading to arthropathy, which is progressive and continues to progress even after normalization of the iron levels by treatment. Clinical Features of Hemochromatosis: The stages of progression of the disease are as follows: Genetic predisposition without abnormalities. Iron overload without symptoms. Iron overload with symptoms (e.g., arthritis, fatigue). Iron overload with organ damage, particularly cirrhosis. In asymptomatic cases: Significant iron overload can occur without any symptoms. Up to 56% of asymptomatic C282Y homozygotes show hepatic iron overload. Initial symptoms may be nonspecific like: Lethargy. Arthralgia. Skin pigmentation. Loss of libido. Signs of diabetes mellitus. Advanced Symptoms: The liver is the first organ affected. Hepatomegaly is seen in >95% of symptomatic patients. (Option A) Excessive skin pigmentation, characterized by a metallic or slate-gray hue called bronzing is seen due to melanin and iron deposits in the dermis. Spider angiomas, splenomegaly, ascites. Cardiac issues , including arrhythmias, Dilated cardiomyopathy and congestive heart failure. Loss of body hair and hypogonadotropic hypogonadism. Diabetes Mellitus: Occurs in approximately 65% of patients with advanced disease, often linked to pancreatic damage from iron deposition. Arthropathy : Small joint, non-erosive, non-inflammatory arthropathy. The 2nd and 3rd metacarpophalangeal joints are the most commonly affected first. Progressive polyarthritis and acute synovitis may occur. Radiologic findings include cystic changes, cartilage loss, and bone proliferation.

      "explanation": "Correct Answer: B) Serum ferritin levels Explanation: The best indicator out of all the biochemical tests for hemochromatosis would be the serum ferritin levels, as this is also an indicator of the body's iron stores . Clinical indicators: Key symptoms suggesting hemochromatosis include: Hepatomegaly Skin pigmentation changes Diabetes mellitus Heart disease Arthritis Hypogonadism Significant iron overload may occur without all symptoms present, necessitating a high level of suspicion for early diagnosis. Patient history: Detailed family history of similar diseases is crucial. Inquire about alcohol consumption, iron intake , and high doses of vitamin C, which can increase iron absorption. Physical Examination: Confirm signs of liver, pancreatic, cardiac, and joint disease through examination and relevant imaging tests. Biochemical Testing: Methods to evaluate total body iron include: Investigation Interpretation Plasma iron level Elevated (not reliable) (vs Option A) Serum transferrin saturation (fasting) Elevated: Iron overload (may have false positives) (vs Option C) >45%: Risk for hemochromatosis Serum ferritin level (Option B) >1000 µ g/L: Disease in C282Y homozygotes (a reliable indicator of body iron stores and is significantly elevated in hemochromatosis). Role of liver biopsy: It measures liver iron concentration and calculates the hepatic iron index. It provides definitive information on liver fibrosis. Predict the prognosis and risk of forming hepatocellular carcinoma. CT/MRI: Help determine the iron concentration in the liver by the increased density in the images. MRI is more accurate for this. They are non-invasive and, hence, are sometimes preferred over biopsy. Liver biopsy (Option D) is a very important method for diagnosing the level of damage to the organ and measures the liver iron concentration in a patient, helping in detecting fibrosis and cirrhosis, but it is not a biochemical test as asked in this scenario. It is used in cases of non-HFE hemochromatosis and those with dual pathology.",

      },
      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "for hemochromatosis. Correct Answer: C) Children of diagnosed individuals under 18 years old should always be screened for hemochromatosis. Explanation: In the case of a parent with hemochromatosis, the testing of children is generally not necessary until they are 18 or if the other parent’s HFE mutation is confirmed. Screening for hemochromatosis: This is done once the diagnosis of hemochromatosis is made. Family screening: Involves counseling and testing the family members of diagnosed individuals, as asymptomatic relatives often show increased transferrin saturation and ferritin levels. All adult first-degree relatives should be tested for C282Y and H63D mutations. (Option A) Testing in children: Testing of children is generally not necessary until they are 18 unless the other parent’s HFE mutation status is known. Controversy in population screening: Screening using transferrin saturation and ferritin levels is effective for detecting hemochromatosis and iron deficiency. (Option D) Genetic screening in the general population is feasible, but its cost-effectiveness is debated. Genetic testing: Genetic testing for the C282Y and H63D mutations is recommended if screening tests are abnormal. (Option B) Hereditary hemochromatosis is a genetically diverse condition influenced by both genetic and acquired factors. The detection of the HFE gene helps in finding the genetic component of the disease.

      },
      "correct_answer": "D",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: D) Phlebotomy Explanation: The first and foremost treatment modality for effective removal of excessive iron from the blood is phlebotomy, which can effectively remove 200-250 mg of iron from 500 ml of blood in one sitting of the procedure. Management of hemochromatosis: The treatment of hemochromatosis aims towards the removal of excess iron and supportive management of the affected organs and is explained below: 1) Iron removal: Phlebotomy (most preferred treatment) : The primary method for removing excess iron involves weekly or biweekly phlebotomy of 500 mL, which contains 200-250 mg of iron . Plasma ferritin concentration decreases ( reduced iron stores) . Plasma transferrin saturation remains elevated. For advanced disease: Weekly phlebotomy until serum ferritin levels reach ≤ 100 µ g/L. Ferritin levels after treatment ≤ 100 µ g/L. Chelation therapy: Indication: Phlebotomy is unfeasible (anemia or hypoproteinemia). Drugs: Deferoxamine (Option A) Parenteral chelating agent (removes 10-20 mg of iron per) Deferasirox (Exjade) and Deferiprone: (Option C) Oral chelating agents are indicated for thalassemia and secondary iron overload. 2) Lifestyle adjustments: Alcohol consumption: it should be minimized or eliminated, as it significantly increases cirrhosis risk in hereditary hemochromatosis. Dietary changes: Generally unnecessary, but avoid vitamin C and iron supplements. 3) Management of complications: Hepatic failure, cardiac failure, and diabetes mellitus are treated similarly to conventional approaches for these conditions. Loss of libido and changes in secondary sex characteristics can be addressed with testosterone replacement or gonadotropin therapy. 4) Liver transplantation: (Option B) This may be indicated in end-stage liver disease, but better outcomes can be seen if excess iron is removed before the procedure. Successful liver transplantation can reverse the underlying metabolic issues related to hemochromatosis. Reference: Harrison’s Principles of Internal Medicine, 21st edition, Page 3234.",
