      "explanation": "Correct Answer: D) Fluid thrill Explanation: The examination being done here is fluid thrill or fluid wave test which helps determine the presence of large volumes of fluid in the abdomen. Clinical manifestations Initially asymptomatic Approximately 1-2 litres of fluid show signs and symptoms, including: Abdominal distension, discomfort, pain. Weight gain (sudden) Nausea, vomiting Respiratory distress having shortness of breath, dyspnea Edema of body parts Everted umbilicus (due to an increase in ascitic fluid) Ascites (Option B) Clinical signs: Puddle sign (Peritoneal fluid >100ml) (Option C) The puddle sign detects small amounts of fluid in the abdomen. In a sitting position, tapping the abdomen produces a distinct sound over fluid, indicating ascites. Shifting dullness (peritoneal fluid >500ml) (Option A) In a supine position, a healthcare provider percusses the abdomen to identify dullness (fluid) and resonance (air). When the patient turns to one side, the fluid shifts, causing dullness to move to the dependent side and resonance to appear on the upper side, indicating ascitic fluid. Fluid thrill or fluid wave test (Option D) The fluid thrill is a sign of large abdominal fluid volumes (more than 1.5 Liters). It occurs when a provider taps one side of the abdomen while feeling the opposite, creating a wave indicating ascites. Hepatic hydrothorax Fluid from the abdomen, usually due to cirrhosis, accumulates in the pleural cavity, typically on the right side, causing shortness of breath and chest discomfort. Abdominal compartment syndrome (intra-abdominal hypertension) can occur if the pressure due to ascites is more than 25 mm Hg.",

      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: A) Alcoholic liver disease Explanation: The clinical features along with the history of alcohol abuse point to the diagnosis of alcohol liver disease. Alcohol liver disease Pathophysiology Alcohol Metabolism Ethanol is primarily metabolized in the liver by enzymes, particularly alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH) and cytochrome P450 2E1 (CYP2E1). This metabolism produces acetaldehyde, a toxic intermediate, which can cause cellular damage. Oxidative Stress The metabolism of alcohol generates reactive oxygen species (ROS) and increases oxidative stress within liver cells. This oxidative damage leads to lipid peroxidation, protein modifications, and DNA damage, contributing to hepatocyte injury and inflammation. Inflammatory Response Alcohol consumption stimulates the activation of immune cells (e.g., Kupffer cells) leading to the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines (TNF- α , IL-6). These cytokines promote inflammation and can further damage hepatocytes. Altered Lipid Metabolism Alcohol disrupts normal lipid metabolism, leading to fat accumulation in liver cells (steatosis). This accumulation can progress to steatohepatitis, where inflammation and liver cell injury occur. Fibrosis and Cirrhosis Chronic inflammation and injury stimulate the activation of hepatic stellate cells, which produce collagen and lead to fibrosis. Over time, repeated injury can result in cirrhosis, characterized by scarring and loss of normal liver architecture. Clinical features: General Usually asymptomatic Fever, malaise, jaundice, history of alcohol intake + (at least within last 8 weeks before symptom onset) Abdominal Right upper quadrant pain, tender hepatomegaly, splenomegaly, ascites Caput medusae: enlarged veins radiating from the umbilicus Bleeding varices (portal hypertension) Dermatological Spider angioma , palmar erythema , ecchymosis Reproductive Gynaecomastia, gonadal atrophy, loss of libido, amenorrhea Neurological Peripheral neuropathy: tingling and numbness usually over feet Wernicke-Korsakoff syndrome: Ophthalmoplegia, confusion, ataxia + anterograde amnesia Hepatic encephalopathy: Asterixis (most prominent finding) , altered sensorium, sleep disturbances, lethargy Others Dupuytren’s contracture , temporal muscle wasting, parotid gland enlargement Alcoholic liver disease LFT: AST (Aspartate aminotransferase) Non-specific ; ↑ (<300-400) ALT (Alanine aminotransferase) Specific for liver injury ; ↑ (<300-400) AST/ALT ratio: ≥ 2: 1 Specific for ALD ALP (Alkaline phosphatase) Elevated in bile duct pathologies GGT ( γ -glutamyl transferase) Non-specific marker of ALD 5’-Nucleotidase Specific marker for bile duct pathologies S.Bilirubin Usually normal/mildly ↑ S.Albumin ↓ in chronic liver disease (cirrhosis) Carbohydrate-deficient transferrin (CDT) Best serum marker for alcoholic liver disease.

      "explanation": "Correct Answer: B) Wilson’s disease: Explanation: The above image shows fine pigmented and granular deposits, suggesting Wilson’s disease. These are Kayser-Fleischer rings due to copper deposits in the descemet’s membrane. Wilson's disease Wilson's disease, also known as hepatolenticular degeneration, is a rare autosomal recessive disorder caused by the abnormal accumulation of copper in the liver, brain, eyes, and other organs. This results in elevated free copper levels, along with increased copper levels in the liver and urine, while serum ceruloplasmin levels are decreased. Gene Affected: The disease is caused by mutations in the ATP7B gene on chromosome 13. This gene encodes a copper-transporting ATPase responsible for excreting copper from the liver into bile. Pathogenesis : Neurofibromatosis 2 (Option A) presents with juvenile cataracts in children, retinal hamartomas, etc. Neurofibromatosis 1 (Option C) presents with Lisch nodules that are small, raised brown spots in the iris. Cataracts (Option D) present as wedge-shaped opacity (cortical cataract) or as dark or black lenses (nuclear cataracts) with other specific findings.

        "D": "Octreotide plus albumin"
      },
      "correct_answer": "D",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: D) Octreotide plus albumin Explanation: The patient likely has Hepatorenal Syndrome (HRS), a complication of advanced liver disease characterized by renal dysfunction due to splanchnic vasodilation and reduced renal perfusion for which the best method of treatment is administering octreotide with albumin . HRS is diagnosed based on clinical features, including worsening renal function, low urine sodium (<10 mEq/L), and exclusion of other causes of acute kidney injury (e.g., hypovolemia, nephrotoxicity). Treatment of Hepatorenal syndrome Discontinue diuretics Albumin infusion- 1 g/kg per day Vasoconstrictors-Terlipressin, Low-dose Norepinephrine Midodrine (an α -agonist), along with octreotide and intravenous albumin The best therapy for HRS is liver transplantation; recovery of renal function is typical in this setting Octreotide is a synthetic analogue of somatostatin, a hormone that inhibits the release of various substances in the body. When combined with albumin , it can help manage hepatorenal syndrome (HRS). HRS occurs due to severe vasoconstriction of the renal blood vessels, leading to reduced renal blood flow and impaired kidney function. Octreotide helps alleviate vasoconstriction, while albumin improves intravascular volume and renal perfusion. The recommended dosage of albumin infusion in HRS is 1 g/kg per day, up to a maximum of 100 g/day, to expand intravascular volume and improve renal perfusion. Higher doses (e.g., 2-5 g/kg/day) are avoided due to risks such as pulmonary oedema. Incorrect Options: Methylprednisolone (Option A) is not used in hepatorenal syndrome due to the potential risk of worsening liver function in patients with cirrhosis. Heparin (Option B) is an anticoagulant and not helpful with HRS management as it raises the concern of haemorrhage. Torsemide (Option C) is a loop diuretic and not suitable for HRS management because diuretics lead to a depletion of effective circulating volume, which is already low in cirrhosis, further increasing the renal hypoperfusion.

        "C": "Parkinsonism",
        "D": "Sydenham’s chorea"
      },
      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: A) Wilson’s disease Explanation: Wing beating tremor, also known as asterixis, refers to a flapping tremor of the hands and arms resembling a bird's wing flapping. It is associated with the presence of hepatic encephalopathy, which can occur in various conditions affecting the liver and central nervous system. Among the options, Wilson's disease is the most likely cause of wing beating tremor. Wilson's disease is a genetic disorder characterized by impaired copper metabolism. The accumulation of copper in the brain can result in neurological symptoms, such as movement disorders. One of the characteristic movement disorders seen in Wilson's disease is a wing beating tremor. It can be elicited by having patients extend their arms and bend their wrists back. In this maneuver, patients who are encephalopathic have a “liver flap” that is, a sudden forward movement of the wrist. Clinical Features of Wilson's Disease Hepatic Symptoms Chronic Hepatitis: Jaundice, hepatomegaly, elevated liver enzymes due to copper accumulation in the liver. Cirrhosis: Portal hypertension, variceal bleeding as a result of long-term copper accumulation and fibrosis. Acute Liver Failure : Coagulopathy, jaundice, encephalopathy. Neurological Symptoms Movement Disorders: Tremors (flapping or wind-beating tremor), dystonia, ataxia, dysarthria due to copper accumulation in the basal ganglia. Parkinsonism-like symptoms : Rigidity, bradykinesia, cogwheel rigidity from copper accumulation in the basal ganglia. Psychiatric: Depression, personality changes, cognitive decline. Ocular Features Kayser-Fleischer Rings: Brown/greenish rings in the cornea due to copper deposition in Descemet's membrane . Sunflower Cataract: Rare, (copper deposition in the lens). Renal Features Renal Tubular Acidosis (Fanconi Syndrome): Due to copper accumulation in renal tubules. Hematologic Features Hemolytic Anemia: Copper-induced red cell damage.

        "C": "Clonazepam",
        "D": "Lorazepam"
      },
      "correct_answer": "D",
      "explanation": "alcoholics. Lorazepam is not extensively metabolized by the liver , and its clearance is less affected by liver dysfunction compared to other benzodiazepines. It has a shorter half-life than diazepam, making it a suitable option for managing alcohol withdrawal symptoms in patients with liver disease. The patient with symptoms of delirium tremens (DTs), which is a severe form of alcohol withdrawal characterized by confusion, agitation, hallucinations, and tremors, are commonly treated by Lorazepam. DTs can be life-threatening and require prompt treatment to manage symptoms and prevent complications. Lorazepam: Lorazepam is a benzodiazepine used to manage alcohol withdrawal symptoms, including delirium tremens. Mechanism of Action: Enhances the effects of GABA , an inhibitory neurotransmitter, which calms the central nervous system and alleviates withdrawal symptoms. Advantages: Relatively long half-life Effective in controlling severe withdrawal symptoms Suitable for patients with liver impairment Metabolism: Primarily through conjugation, which is less affected by liver dysfunction compared to other benzodiazepines. Lorazepam is the drug of choice for the management of status epilepticus due to its rapid onset of action and effectiveness in terminating seizures. Diazepam, Alprazolam, Clonazepam (Option A, B and C) are extensively metabolized by the liver and are not recommended in patients with liver disease.

        "D": "Rotor syndrome."
      },
      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: C) Gilbert syndrome Explanation: The most probable diagnosis of Gilbert Syndrome as it causes mild jaundice under stressful circumstances. Gilbert Syndrome About Gilber Gilbert Syndrome (GS) is a common, benign condition with mild unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia and normal liver function tests , affecting up to 8% of people, more common in males. Pathophysiology Caused by reduced UGT1A1 enzyme activity (10–35% of normal), often due to a TA insertion variant in the UGT1A1 promoter (A[TA]7TAA). Inheritance is typically autosomal recessive with the promoter variant; some cases show dominant inheritance with other mutations. Clinical Features Serum bilirubin <51 µ mol/L (<3 mg/dL), fluctuating with stress, fasting, alcohol, or illness; jaundice may occur during elevations. Most patients are asymptomatic, though jaundice can occur during episodes of elevated bilirubin levels. Often diagnosed incidentally in adolescence or adulthood. Investigations Serum bilirubin levels are intermittently high, with Normal liver function tests and hepatic histology. UGT1A1 gene testing may reveal the A[TA]7TAA promoter variant. Management Lifestyle adjustments, such as avoiding alcohol and maintaining regular calorie intake, may help manage bilirubin levels. Phenobarbital can normalize bilirubin levels if required. Caution with drugs metabolized by UGT1A1 (e.g., irinotecan, HIV protease inhibitors) due to risk of toxicity. Dubin Johnson (Option A) has conjugated hyperbilirubinemia and brown black melanin-like deposition on the liver. Crigler Najjar type 1(Option B) presents with kernicterus and neurological damage in neonates, is characterized by severe unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia (typically >20 mg/dL) due to the complete absence of UGT1A1 activity. Patients often exhibit significant jaundice from infancy and are at risk for kernicterus. Rotor syndrome (Option D) is similar to Dubin Johnson syndrome but the presentation is mild and there is increased conjugated bilirubin and the liver does not have black coloured deposits.

        "D": "Combined pegylated interferon with lamivudine"
      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer B - Tenofovir for >40 weeks The patient has chronic hepatitis B, confirmed by HBsAg, HBeAg, high viral load, and elevated SGPT, indicating active liver inflammation. The goal is to suppress viral replication and reduce liver inflammation. Tenofovir is the first-line therapy, a potent nucleos(t)ide analog that effectively suppresses HBV replication, lowers HBV DNA, and improves liver histology, including reducing fibrosis and cirrhosis. Administered once daily for extended periods (>40 weeks), it has potential side effects such as renal dysfunction and hypophosphatemia but remains preferred due to its strong efficacy and low resistance risk. Chronic Hepatitis B treatment: It needs antiviral therapy Drugs: Interferons (peginterferon alfa-2a, interferon alfa-2b) Nucleoside analogs (entecavir, lamivudine, telbivudine) Nucleotide analogs (adefovir, tenofovir) Oral agents: First-line: entecavir, tenofovir Second-line: lamivudine, adefovir, telbivudine Duration of therapy 48 to 52 weeks Lifestyle modifications include reducing the intake of agents with the potential for liver damage such as alcohol, hepatotoxic medications, herbal medications, and herbal supplements. Lamivudine for 30+ weeks (Option A): Lamivudine is an older nucleoside analog and, although effective in inhibiting HBV replication, it is no longer the preferred treatment due to the risk of resistance and lower efficacy compared to tenofovir. Pegylated interferon for 52 weeks (Option C): Pegylated interferon is another option for hepatitis B, often used when there is a desire to achieve sustained virologic response without long-term antiviral therapy. However, it is associated with poor tolerability, subcutaneous administration, and has lower effectiveness compared to oral agents like tenofovir. Combined pegylated interferon with lamivudine (Option D): This combination may provide a more profound suppression of HBV DNA during therapy, but studies show it does not offer significant advantages over monotherapy with either drug. The combination therapy also increases the risk of side effects, making it less preferred. Reference: Harrison's Principles of Internal Medicine, 21st Edition, Page: 2592-2599, 2565-2566, 2576.

The liver function test results indicate elevated levels of total bilirubin, direct bilirubin, SGOT (aspartate aminotransferase), and SGPT (alanine aminotransferase). These findings further support the suspicion of acute viral hepatitis. To determine the specific etiology of acute viral hepatitis, appropriate serological tests are necessary. The recommended investigations for ruling out acute viral hepatitis include: AntiHAV (IgM antibody against hepatitis A virus): Hepatitis A virus (HAV) infection is characterized by the presence of IgM antibodies against HAV during the acute phase of the infection. HBsAg (Hepatitis B surface antigen): HBsAg is a marker of current hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection. Its presence indicates ongoing viral replication and infectivity. IgM antiHBc (IgM antibody against hepatitis B core antigen): IgM antiHBc appears during the acute phase of hepatitis B infection and is a marker of recent HBV infection. AntiHCV (Antibodies against hepatitis C virus): AntiHCV antibodies are tested to detect hepatitis C virus infection.

The patient's age, male gender, and history of recent viral infection suggest an acute episode of unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia, which is common in Gilbert syndrome. The normal levels of serum AST and ALT exclude the possibility of liver injury or hepatitis. The elevated levels of unconjugated bilirubin and normal levels of conjugated bilirubin are consistent with the diagnosis of Gilbert syndrome. Gilbert syndrome is a common genetic disorder that causes mild unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia due to reduced activity of UDPGT enzyme. It is usually asymptomatic, but patients may present with intermittent episodes of mild jaundice triggered by fasting, dehydration, and stress. In Gilbert syndrome, serum levels of unconjugated bilirubin are elevated, while conjugated bilirubin levels are usually normal. Serum AST and ALT levels are also normal. Incorrect Options: Option A - Dubin-Johnson syndrome: Dubin-Johnson syndrome is a rare genetic disorder that causes chronic conjugated hyperbilirubinemia (increased levels of bilirubin conjugated with glucuronic acid) due to impaired excretion of bilirubin from hepatocytes. It is usually asymptomatic, but patients may present with mild jaundice and dark urine. In Dubin-Johnson syndrome, serum levels of both conjugated and unconjugated bilirubin are elevated. Serum AST and ALT levels may also be elevated. Option B - Criggler-Najar type 1 syndrome: Criggler-Najar type 1 syndrome is another rare genetic disorder that causes severe unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia due to impaired activity of uridine diphosphate glucuronyl transferase (UDPGT) enzyme. The condition is characterized by recurrent episodes of jaundice and kernicterus (a type of brain damage caused by bilirubin deposition in the brain) in infancy. In Criggler-Najar type 1 syndrome, serum levels of unconjugated bilirubin are significantly elevated, while conjugated bilirubin levels are usually normal. Option D - Rotor syndrome: Rotor syndrome is a rare genetic disorder that causes chronic conjugated hyperbilirubinemia due to impaired uptake and storage of bilirubin in hepatocytes. It is usually asymptomatic, but patients may present with mild jaundice and dark urine. In Rotor syndrome, serum levels of conjugated bilirubin are elevated, while unconjugated bilirubin levels are usually normal. Serum AST and ALT levels may also be elevated.
