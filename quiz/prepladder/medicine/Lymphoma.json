        "A": "Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma",
        "B": "Gastric MALT lymphoma",
        "C": "Multicentric Castleman’s disease",
        "D": "Primary CNS diffuse large B-cell lymphoma"
      },
      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: A) Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma Explanation: The clinical scenario mentions both the presence of an HIV infection and a non-Hodgkin’s B-cell type lymphoma, which points to the diffuse large B-cell lymphoma that is associated with HIV patients. Types of non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma based on infectious agents: Non-Hodgkin’s lymphomas can be associated with infectious agents. Infectious agent Lymphoid malignancy Epstein-Barr virus Burkitt’s lymphoma Post-organ transplant lymphoma Primary CNS diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (Option D ruled out) Hodgkin’s lymphoma Extranodal NK/T-cell lymphoma, nasal type HTLV-1 Adult T-cell leukaemia/lymphoma HIV Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma Burkitt’s lymphoma Hepatitis C virus Lymphoplasmacytic lymphoma Helicobacter pylori Gastric MALT lymphoma (Option B ruled out) Human herpes virus 8 Primary effusion lymphoma Multicentric Castleman’s disease (Option C ruled out) Key points: HTLV-1 has a long latency from infection to oncogenesis as it causes adult T-cell leukaemia in people who were infected via an infected mother’s breast milk as babies, with the mean age of presentation being 56 years. In HIV-infected patients, aggressive B-cell NHL develops. Grading of Non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma: The grade of the lymphoma is a significant factor clinically as it determines the rate of proliferation of the disease. High-grade NHL Low-grade NHL This type has a high rate of proliferation. Rapidly produces symptoms. It is fatal if not treated. However, it is curable. It has a low proliferation rate. It may stay asymptomatic for months or years. It has a slow course of disease. It is not curable with conventional treatments. Over I rds of the NHL in the world are either Diffuse large B-cell NHL, which is high-grade NHL or Follicular NHL, which is a low-grade NHL.

      "explanation": "Correct Answer: D) Mycosis fungoides Explanation: The clinical features of eczematous lesions with Pautrier microabscesses on histopathology point to diagnosing mycosis fungoides , the most common cutaneous T-cell lymphoma . WHO types of T-cell varieties of non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma are as follows: T-cell granular lymphocytic leukemia Adult T-cell leukaemia/lymphoma (HTLV-1+) Extranodal NK/T-cell lymphoma, nasal type Enteropathy-associated T-cell lymphoma Hepatosplenic T-cell lymphoma Subcutaneous panniculitis-like T-cell lymphoma Mycosis fungoides Sezary syndrome Peripheral T-cell lymphoma NOS Angioimmunoblastic T-cell lymphoma Anaplastic large-cell lymphoma, ALK+ Anaplastic large-cell lymphoma, ALK– Cutaneous T-cell lymphomas: The mature T-cell disorders include cutaneous lymphomas and peripheral T-cell lymphomas. Mycosis fungoides Sezary syndrome (Option A) This is the most common cutaneous T-cell lymphoma that mimics benign skin diseases. This condition slowly develops from mycosis fungoides and is an aggressive form. It usually presents with chronic eczematous lesions . It is an erythrodermic cutaneous T-cell lymphoma with a leukemic component. The skin lesions are thin erythematous plaques or flat patches . They are single or multiple lesions in the gluteal region/thighs. Skin lesions are intense , widespread pruritic erythroderma . It involves ~80% of the total body surface area. On histopathology, atypical cells are seen as aggregates in the epidermal layer, forming Pautrier microabscesses . Epidermotropism of atypical cells is seen. Pautrier microabscesses may or may not be present. Sparse dermal infiltrate is seen and may lack epidermotropism. The atypical circulating lymphocytes are called Sezary cells having cerebriform nuclei . The treatment goal is mainly palliative, with the usage of topical/systemic steroids for pruritis and other symptoms. Adult T-cell lymphoma (Option B) : It is associated with the HTLV-1 virus and contracted via infected breast milk. It typically presents at around age 60 with circulating disease, bone marrow involvement, hypercalcemia, lytic bone lesions, lymphadenopathy, hepatosplenomegaly, skin lesions, and opportunistic infections. Subcutaneous panniculitis-like T-cell lymphoma (Option C) is a rare condition often mistaken for panniculitis. It presents in young men in their fifth and sixth decades of life with multiple subcutaneous nodules that may progress to ulceration.",

      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: A) Burkitt's Lymphoma Explanation: Rapidly enlarging jaw mass, \"starry sky\" biopsy appearance, positive CD19/CD20/CD10 markers, and t(8;14) translocation, along with EBV positivity, point to Burkitt's lymphoma. Burkitt's Lymphoma: Constitutes ~30% of childhood NHL. Fastest-growing neoplasms with a doubling time of <24 hours. Predominantly affects males. Typically seen in patients <35 years of age. Associated with a translocation involving C-MYC on chromosome 8: t(8;14): M/c, t(8;2), t(8,22). Types and Presentations: Endemic (African) form: Presents as a jaw or facial bone tumour, spreading to extranodal sites such as ovaries, testis, kidneys, breasts, bone marrow, and meninges. Jaw involvement is characteristic of endemic Burkitt’s lymphoma. EBV positive. Non-endemic form: Has an abdominal presentation with massive disease, ascites, and involvement of organs like the kidneys, testis, and ovaries, also spreading to the bone marrow and CNS. EBV negative. Immunodeficiency-related form: More often involves lymph nodes and may present as acute leukaemia. Histopathology: High proliferation rate with \" starry sky \" appearance due to tingible body macrophages .

Negative for BCL2. Treatment: Extremely chemosensitive; early initiation of treatment is crucial due to the rapid doubling time. Prophylactic therapy to the CNS is mandatory. Dose-adjusted EPOCH-R (rituximab, etoposide, vincristine, doxorubicin, cyclophosphamide, prednisone) is highly effective. Salvage therapy is generally ineffective in relapsed cases. Follicular Lymphoma (Option A) is a slow-growing B-cell lymphoproliferative disorder characterized by BCL2 positivity, whereas this case presents with a fast-growing mass and BCL2 negativity, ruling it out. Mantle Cell Lymphoma (Option B) typically presents with cyclin D1 overexpression and does not show the \"starry sky\" appearance or the immunophenotype (CD10 positivity) characteristic of Burkitt's Lymphoma. Diffuse Large B-Cell Lymphoma (Option C): While DLBCL can present with a rapidly enlarging mass, it typically does not show the \"starry sky\" appearance, which is distinctive for Burkitt's Lymphoma. DLBCL is also more commonly associated with BCL2 positivity.",

      "correct_answer": "D",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: D) Diffuse Large B-cell lymphoma Explanation: The presence of a rapidly growing abdominal mass, systemic B symptoms (fever, night sweats, weight loss), elevated LDH levels, and biopsy findings showing large atypical lymphocytes expressing CD19 and CD20 point towards a diagnosis of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL). Diffuse Large B-Cell Lymphoma (DLBCL): Most common subtype of Non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma (NHL). Age > 64 years Men > Female Often related to Epstein-Barr virus and HIV. Presentation: Typically presents as a rapidly growing mass or enlarging lymph nodes in nodal or extranodal sites. The majority of patients have advanced-stage disease at diagnosis. ~40% have B symptoms (fever, night sweats, and weight loss), and 50% have elevated LDH levels. Up to 40% have non-lymph node involvement: Bone marrow, CNS, GI tract, thyroid, liver, and skin. M/c primary extranodal site: Gastrointestinal tract > Skin Tumor Characteristics: Diffuse proliferation of large atypical lymphocytes with high proliferative index. Expression of B-cell markers: CD19, CD20, CD79a. Types: Germinal centre subtype (GCB): BCL6 and CD10 expression Non-GCB (ABC subtype): MUM1 expression. BCL2 is overexpressed in 25-80% of cases, and BCL6 positive in >2/3 of cases. Important Terminologies: Double hit lymphoma: Involves MYC rearrangement along with BCL2 and/or BCL6. Triple hit lymphoma: Involves rearrangements in BCL2, BCL6, and MYC. Treatment: First-line treatment: R-CHOP (rituximab, cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, prednisone) is the standard. Early-stage disease: Full-course R-CHOP for six cycles or abbreviated chemotherapy (3-4 cycles) followed by involved field radiotherapy. Advanced-stage disease: Full-course chemotherapy. Relapsed/Refractory Disease: Salvage chemotherapy followed by autologous stem cell transplantation. Follicular Lymphoma (Option A) is a slow-growing B-cell lymphoproliferative disorder that typically presents with painless lymphadenopathy. In contrast, the case involves a rapidly growing abdominal mass with systemic B symptoms (fever, night sweats, weight loss), and a biopsy showing large atypical cells suggesting a more aggressive disease like diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL). Mantle Cell Lymphoma (Option B) typically follows an aggressive clinical course characterized by overexpression of the cyclin D1 (CCND1) gene. In contrast, diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) lacks Cyclin D1 overexpression and presents with large atypical B cells and rapidly growing tumours. Classical Hodgkin's Lymphoma (Option C) typically presents in young adults with slow-growing cervical lymphadenopathy and Reed-Sternberg cells in a biopsy, which is inconsistent with the rapidly growing abdominal mass and diffuse large lymphocytes seen in this case are more indicative of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL).

      },
      "correct_answer": "D",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: D) R-CHOP regimen is the first-line treatment. Explanation: The R-CHOP regimen (Rituximab, Cyclophosphamide, Hydroxydaunorubicin, Oncovin, and Prednisone) is not the preferred first-line treatment for MZL, particularly for gastric MALT lymphoma. For MALT lymphoma, especially in cases associated with H. pylori, the first-line treatment is the eradication of H. pylori with a triple-drug therapy regimen consisting of a proton pump inhibitor (PPI), clarithromycin, and amoxicillin or metronidazole. This approach can lead to the complete remission of gastric MALT lymphoma in many cases. Marginal Zone Lymphoma / Mucosa-Associated Lymphoid Tissue (MALT) Lymphoma Occurrence: Primarily affects extranodal sites, with the gastrointestinal tract being the most common location; the stomach is particularly affected. Demographics: Typically presents around 60 years of age, with a female predominance. Pathophysiology MALT lymphoma is characterized by the proliferation of small B lymphocytes. Clinical Symptoms Common symptoms include gastrointestinal discomfort, such as nausea and abdominal pain. Approximately 95% of cases are associated with chronic Helicobacter pylori infection, leading to non-atrophic pangastritis. This chronic inflammatory state is a significant risk factor for the development of lymphoma. Autoimmune Associations MALT lymphoma is associated with several autoimmune disorders, particularly Sjögren's syndrome. Other conditions, such as rheumatoid arthritis and Hashimoto's thyroiditis, may also predispose individuals to MALT lymphoma due to chronic inflammation. Immunophenotyping Positive Markers: CD20, CD19, CD22 Negative Markers: CD5, CD10, CD23 MZL is usually a diagnosis of exclusion if IHC markers are given Chromosomal Translocation seen in MZL: t( 11:18) Prognosis MALT lymphoma generally has a favourable prognosis in the early stages, with 5-year overall survival rates exceeding 90%. Treatment First-line treatment typically involves an anti-H. pylori regimen, which may include antibiotics (e.g., amoxicillin, clarithromycin) and proton pump inhibitors (PPIs). In about 5% to 10% of cases, more aggressive treatment, such as the R-CHOP chemotherapy regimen (Rituximab, Cyclophosphamide, Doxorubicin, Vincristine, and Prednisone), may be necessary.",

      "explanation": "Correct Answer: A) Follicular lymphoma Explanation: Follicular lymphoma is a common type of indolent non-Hodgkin lymphoma that arises from germinal centre B-cells . The characteristic histological feature of follicular lymphoma is the presence of \"buttock cells\" (centrocytes), which are cleaved B-cells with irregular, indented nuclei. These cells, along with centroblasts, are key features in the nodular or follicular growth pattern seen in biopsies. Follicular Lymphoma Follicular lymphoma is the most common type of indolent non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) globally. This malignancy arises from the germinal centre B-cells, specifically from centrocytes. It is characterized as a low-grade lymphoma. Good prognosis, especially in its early stages. Epidemiology and Presentation Presents in individuals around 60 years of age and is more prevalent in males. Spontaneous remission can occur in some cases. B-symptoms, such as fever, night sweats, and weight loss, are rare in this condition. Extranodal involvement is not common. In advanced stages, a leukemic phase may be observed. Pathogenesis Chromosomal Translocation, t(14;18) ↓ Juxtaposition of the immunoglobulin heavy chain locus (chromosome 14) and the Bcl-2 gene (chromosome 18). ↓ Overexpression of Bcl-2 protein (Anti-Apoptotic) ↓ Inhibition of apoptosis ↓ Increased survival and proliferation of B cells. ↓ Development of follicular lymphoma.

      "explanation": "system Correct Answer: C) It frequently presents at advanced stages (I or II) in the Ann Arbor staging system. Explanation: Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma often presents at more advanced stages (III or IV) due to the widespread involvement of lymph nodes and extranodal sites. Lugano classification is also used for staging NHL Non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) Non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) is a diverse group of hematologic malignancies characterized by the proliferation of lymphoid tissue. Non-Hodgkin lymphomas (NHL) into B-cell and T-cell subtypes: The majority of non-Hodgkin lymphomas are of B-cell origin, making them more prevalent than T-cell subtypes. B cell NHL is further classified based on cell size, cell pattern, IHC markers and cytogenetic translocations. Small B cells : Follicular lymphoma Mantle cell lymphoma Marginal zone lymphoma and Small lymphocytic lymphoma (which is CLL-affecting tissues) Intermediate-size B cells : Burkitt lymphoma Large B cells : DLBCL Based on cell of origin B-NHL Classification: Pre-germinal (Mantle zone) : MZL CLL/SLL Germinal : Follicular cell lymphoma Burkitt lymphoma DLBCL Post germinal : Marginal zone lymphoma/ MALT lymphoma Lymphoplasmacytic lymphoma Demographics and Incidence NHL is more prevalent in individuals over 60 years of age and demonstrates a slight male predominance. Common Presentations of Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma Asymptomatic Palpable Lymphadenopathy: One of the hallmark presentations of NHL is unexplained, asymptomatic lymphadenopathy. Patients often notice enlarged lymph nodes, typically in the neck, armpits, or groin. NHL lymphadenopathy is usually not rapidly progressive, which can help differentiate it from other causes of lymph node enlargement. B Symptoms (Fever, Night Sweats, and Weight Loss): These constitutional symptoms, are relatively rare in early-stage NHL but become more significant in advanced disease. The presence of B symptoms often indicates a more aggressive or widespread disease process. (Option A ruled out) Extranodal Involvement Common Sites: Frequently involves extranodal sites (Option B ruled out). Gastrointestinal tract, particularly the ileocecal region, is commonly affected, leading to symptoms such as abdominal pain or changes in bowel habits. Lymphomatoid polyposis can also occur. Oropharynx, especially Waldeyer's ring, can be involved, presenting with sore throat or difficulty swallowing. Bone Marrow Involvement: Significant in NHL, particularly in non-nodal subtypes, bone marrow infiltration can lead to cytopenias (anaemia, leukopenia, and thrombocytopenia). Splenomegaly: NHL often results in splenic involvement, which is more pronounced than in Hodgkin lymphoma. This may lead to splenomegaly, causing abdominal discomfort and a sensation of fullness. Advanced Disease at Diagnosis: NHL typically presents at more advanced stages, particularly Stages III and IV according to the Ann Arbor staging system. (Option C) Ann Arbor Staging System for Lymphoma Stage Description I Involvement of a single lymph node region II Involvement of two or more lymph node regions on the same side of the diaphragm III Involvement of lymph node regions on both sides of the diaphragm IV Disseminated disease involving one or more extranodal sites, including bone marrow, liver, or other organs Arbor Staging System for Lymphoma\" data-author=\"\" data-hash=\"10336\" data-license=\"\" data-source=\"\"",

      "explanation": "Correct Answer: B) Expression of latent membrane protein-1 (LMP-1). Explanation: LMP-1 is a viral protein in EBV-positive tumours that mimics CD40 , a receptor crucial for B-cell activation. By activating the NF- κ B signalling pathway , LMP-1 promotes the survival and proliferation of Reed-Sternberg cells in classical Hodgkin Lymphoma (cHL), facilitating tumour growth and enabling the cells to evade apoptosis. Etiology & Pathogenesis of Hodgkin Lymphoma (HL) Hodgkin Lymphoma is a mature B-cell tumour. More common in whites & Males. Bimodal age distribution with peaks in the 20s and 80s. It is not a part of AIDS-defining lymphoma. Risk Factors : HIV infection is a major risk factor. Epstein-Barr virus (EBV). Reed-Sternberg (HRS) Cells HRS cells are derived from the germinal centre or post-germinal centre B cells (mature B cells in peripheral lymph nodes) as revealed by clonal IGH gene rearrangements and somatic hypermutation. Diagnostic of HL. Large, with abundant cytoplasm, bilobed or multinucleated. Typically positive for PAX-5, CD15, and CD30. NF- κ B Activation Common in cHL, promoting RS cell growth and survival. EBV+ Tumors : Express latent membrane protein-1 (LMP-1) , which activates NF- κ B . (Option B) EBV − Tumors : NF- κ B activation may result from loss-of-function mutations in I κ B or l oss-of-function mutation of TNF- α –induced protein 3 , both of which normally inhibit NF- κ B. (Options A & C) NF- κ B activation may rescue \"crippled\" B cells that can't express Ig, preventing apoptosis and enabling further mutations that form RS cells. Tumor Microenvironment RS cells secrete cytokines (e.g., IL-5, IL-10) and chemokines (e.g., eotaxin) that attract reactive cells (e.g., eosinophils, T cells). (Option D) These reactive cells support tumour growth and modify the immune response, with ligands activating RS cell receptors (e.g., CD30, CD40), further upregulating NF- κ B. Immune Evasion 97% of HRS cells have genetic abnormalities at the PD-L1 locus on chromosome 9p24.1 , leading to PD-L1 overexpression, which helps the tumour evade immune detection. Viral Oncogenesis : EBV involvement is stronger in HIV-associated HL, where nearly all cases show EBV expression. Reference: Harrison’s Principles of Internal Medicine, 21st edition Page: 852.

      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: B) Burkitt’s lymphoma Explanation: Burkitt’s lymphoma is a mature B-cell lymphoma characterized by rapid growth. It typically presents with systemic symptoms such as weight loss, fatigue, and abdominal masses, and it is associated with high LDH levels due to the rapid cell turnover. Immunohistochemical staining showing CD19, CD20, and CD79 positivity is consistent with a B-cell origin, further supporting Burkitt's lymphoma. It is a type of non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma. Non-Hodgkin’s lymphomas are malignancies of the mature B, T, or NK cells. Different types of lymphomas under these categories have different proliferation rates, with some being indolent, while others are aggressive. Non-Hodgkin’s lymphomas are classified based on the cell of origin as follows: B-cell origin (90%) T-cell origin (10%) These are mature (peripheral) B-cell neoplasms These are mature (peripheral) T-cell neoplasms Hairy cell leukemia Waldenstorm macroglobulinemia Follicular lymphoma Mantle cell lymphoma Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma and subtypes Splenic marginal zone B-cell lymphoma Extranodal marginal B-cell lymphoma High-grade B-cell lymphoma NOS Burkitt’s lymphoma/Burkitt’s cell leukaemia Primary mediastinal large B-cell lymphoma HHV8+ DCLBL NOS Plasmablastic lymphoma Intravascular large B-cell leukaemia T-cell granular lymphocytic leukemia Adult T-cell lymphoma/leukaemia Extranodal NK/T-cell lymphoma, nasal type Enteropathy-associated T-cell lymphoma Hepatosplenic T-cell lymphoma Subcutaneous panniculitis-like T-cell lymphoma Mycosis fungoides (Option A) Sezary syndrome (Option C) Peripheral T-cell lymphoma NOS Angioimmunoblastic T-cell lymphoma Anaplastic large-cell lymphoma, ALK+ (Option D) Anaplastic large-cell lymphoma, ALK- The most prevalent mature B cell neoplasms include: Follicular lymphoma Burkitt lymphoma Diffuse large B cell lymphoma Mantle cell lymphoma Marginal zone lymphoma Chronic lymphocytic leukaemia/ Small lymphocytic lymphoma Primary CNS lymphoma The most common mature T cell lymphomas are: Adult T cell lymphoma Mycosis fungoides Reference: Harrison’s Principles of Internal Medicine, 21st edition, Page: 841.",

      "explanation": "Correct Answer: A) 6 cycles of ABVD regimen alone Explanation: Advanced-stage classical Hodgkin lymphoma is commonly managed with 6 cycles of the ABVD regimen (doxorubicin, bleomycin, vinblastine, and dacarbazine). Classical Hodgkin Lymphoma: Early-Stage Disease: Favourable disease (low-risk): Common regimen: ABVD (doxorubicin, bleomycin, vinblastine, and dacarbazine). 4-6 cycles of ABVD alone achieve progression-free survival rates of 88-92%. Unfavorable disease (higher risk): ABVD for 4 cycles + field radiation or 6 cycles of ABVD alone. (Option C) Radiation therapy is more beneficial in a bulky disease. Advanced-Stage Disease: Treated primarily with 6 cycles of ABVD alone. (Option A) Alternative Chemotherapy Regimens: Stanford V regimen BEACOPP regimen (bleomycin, etoposide, doxorubicin, cyclophosphamide, vincristine, procarbazine and prednisolone) Relapsed Disease: Standard salvage chemotherapy followed by autologous stem cell transplantation. Standard salvage chemotherapy regimens include ICE (ifosfamide, carboplatin and etoposide) and GND (gemcitabine, vinorelbine and doxorubicin) Newer combinations: Brentuximab with either chemotherapy or immune checkpoint inhibitors (nivolumab, pembrolizumab).

WHO Modified Revised European-American Lymphoma (REAL) Classification: Nodular Lymphocyte Predominant Hodgkin Lymphoma (5%) Classical Hodgkin Lymphoma Nodular Sclerosing (70%) Mixed Cellularity (20%) Lymphocyte-Rich (5%) Lymphocyte-Depleted (rare) Nodular Lymphocyte-Predominant Hodgkin's Lymphoma (NLPHL): (Option D) Distinct from classical Hodgkin’s lymphoma (cHL). Accounts for < 5% of all Hodgkin's lymphoma cases. Shows a nodular growth pattern. Predominance of small lymphocytes and rare Reed-Sternberg-like cells or L&H (lymphocyte and histiocyte) or \"popcorn\" cells. L&H cells are a clonal proliferation of B-cells positive for CD20, CD19, CD45, CD79a, BCL2, and BCL6. Negative for CD30 and CD15, which are typically found on classical Hodgkin Reed-Sternberg (HRS) cells. (Option C) Chronic relapsing courses are common. May transform to diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) , especially the T-cell/histiocyte-rich subtype. More common in males (75% of cases). Treatment: Early-Stage: Definitive radiotherapy Symptomatic patients or those with organ impairment: Treated with both classical HL regimens (ABVD) and B-cell NHL regimens (R-CHOP). Follicular Lymphoma (Option A) typically presents with generalized painless lymphadenopathy that is waxing and waning, often involving multiple lymph node regions and extranodal sites. This contrasts with the localized lymphadenopathy and chronic relapsing symptoms seen in Nodular Lymphocyte-Predominant Hodgkin's Lymphoma (NLPHL). Diffuse Large B-cell lymphoma (Option B) typically presents as a rapidly growing mass with extranodal involvement and does not align with the chronic relapsing symptoms and localized lymphadenopathy characteristic of Nodular Lymphocyte-Predominant Hodgkin's Lymphoma (NLPHL).
