      "question": "A male patient with infertility presents a disorder comprising the triad of situs inversus, chronic sinusitis, and bronchiectasis. Which of the following is the correct diagnosis?",
      "options": {
        "A": "Kartagener's syndrome",
        "B": "Cystic fibrosis",
        "C": "Mucovicidosis",
        "D": "Klinefelter syndrome"
      },
      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: A) Kartagener's syndrome Explanation: Kartagener's syndrome is a rare genetic disorder characterized by primary ciliary dyskinesia affecting the respiratory tract and reproductive system. The condition is autosomal recessive and results from a defect in the dynein protein, which affects ciliary motility. The classical clinical presentation includes a diagnostic triad of situs inversus, chronic sinusitis, and bronchiectasis . Additional manifestations include male infertility due to impaired sperm motility and subfertility in females due to altered ciliary function in the fallopian tubes. Cystic fibrosis (Option B): While cystic fibrosis can cause respiratory symptoms and male infertility, it typically presents with productive cough, steatorrhea, and failure to thrive. The characteristic triad of situs inversus, chronic sinusitis, and bronchiectasis are not typical of cystic fibrosis. Mucovicidosis (Option C): This is another name for cystic fibrosis and is not a separate condition. The term is sometimes used interchangeably with cystic fibrosis. Klinefelter syndrome (Option D) : This is a chromosomal disorder characterized by an extra X chromosome in males, presenting with tall stature, small testes, gynecomastia, and azoospermia. It does not involve the respiratory manifestations described in the case. Reference: https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3519024/ Shawâ€™s Textbook of Gynaecology, 17th Edition, Page 205-206",

      "question": "In bronchial asthma, what is the minimum percentage increase in the FEV1/FVC ratio that indicates a reversible obstruction following the administration of bronchodilators?",
      "options": {
        "A": ">12%",
        "B": ">20%",
        "C": ">10%",
        "D": ">18%"
      },
      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "airflow limitation. After the administration of bronchodilators, an improvement in airflow may be observed in reversible airway obstruction. The criterion for a significant response is usually defined as an increase in the FEV1/FVC ratio by more than 12%. This improvement indicates that the bronchodilator has effectively reversed the airflow limitation in the patient.",

      "question": "A 50-year-old male patient undergoing treatment for lung cancer complains of difficulty in breathing and dizziness. Upon examination, diminished breath sounds are noted over the left inferior-scapular region. What is the most probable diagnosis?",
      "options": {
        "A": "Constrictive pericarditis",
        "B": "Pleural effusion",
        "C": "Cardiac tamponade",
        "D": "Pneumothorax"
      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "space, leading to compression of the lung. Diminished breath sounds over the affected area are a characteristic finding. It is a common complication in lung cancer patients. Incorrect Options: Option A - Constrictive pericarditis: Constrictive pericarditis is characterized by the thickening and fibrosis of the pericardium, leading to impaired diastolic filling of the heart. It typically presents with symptoms such as dyspnea and fatigue, but it is not associated with diminished breath sounds over a specific lung region. Option C - Cardiac tamponade: Cardiac tamponade results from the accumulation of fluid in the pericardial sac, leading to impaired cardiac filling. This condition can cause symptoms such as dyspnea and dizziness, but it is not associated with diminished breath sounds in a specific lung region. Option D - Pneumothorax: Pneumothorax is characterized by the presence of air in the pleural space, leading to lung collapse. It can cause symptoms such as sudden chest pain and dyspnea, but it is not typically associated with diminished breath sounds over the left inferior-scapular region.",
