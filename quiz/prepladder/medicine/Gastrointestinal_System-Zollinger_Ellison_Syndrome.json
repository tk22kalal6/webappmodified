      "explanation": "Correct answer: B) 2, 4, 5 Explanation: The given clinical scenario of a male with recurrent burning abdominal pain, diarrhea, weight loss, elevated gastrin levels, and endoscopic findings of multiple ulcers in the stomach and duodenum are suggestive of Zollinger-Ellison syndrome . Zollinger-Ellison syndrome (ZES) is a severe peptic ulcer diathesis secondary to gastric acid hypersecretion due to unregulated gastrin release from a non– β -cell , often well-differentiated neuroendocrine tumour (NET; gastrinoma ). Pathophysiology: Hypergastrinemia originating from an autonomous neoplasm is the driving force responsible for the clinical manifestations in ZES. Gastrin stimulates acid secretion through gastrin receptors on parietal cells and by inducing histamine release from ECL cells. Gastrin also has a trophic action on gastric epithelial cells. Longstanding hypergastrinemia leads to markedly increased gastric acid secretion through parietal cell stimulation and increased parietal cell mass. The increased gastric acid output leads to peptic ulcer diathesis, erosive esophagitis, and diarrhea. Tumor location: Most gastrinomas (60-90%) are located in the Passaro triangle ; its boundaries are: Superior: Confluence of the cystic and the common bile ducts. Inferior: Junction of the second and the third part of the duodenum. Medial: Junction of the neck and the body of the pancreas. Pancreas (most commonly in the head ). Less common sites: Stomach, bones, ovaries, heart, liver, and lymph nodes. >60% of tumors are considered malignant , with up to 30–50% of patients having multiple lesions or metastatic disease at presentation. (Statement 2) Clinical presentation: Abdominal pain Due to peptic ulcer (M/C- >90%) . ZES is suspected if: Ulcers in unusual locations (2nd part of the duodenum and beyond). Refractory to medical therapy. Recurrence after acid-reducing surgery. Presents with complications like bleeding and perforation. It is not associated with H. pylori or NSAID",

      "question": "A 40-year-old male presents to the gastroenterology clinic with complaints of acidity and recurrent abdominal pain that worsens at night and is not relieved by antacids, weight loss, and diarrhea. On further evaluation, his serum gastrin levels were elevated, and an endoscopic ultrasound showed ulcers in the second and third parts of the duodenum and a tumor of 2.5 cm in size. Which of the following is the recommended treatment option for this patient?",
      "options": {
        "A": "Proton pump inhibitors",
        "B": "Omeprazole + Clarithromycin + Amoxicillin",
        "C": "Surgical removal",
        "D": "Radiofrequency ablation"
      },
      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "diarrhea, weight loss, elevated gastrin levels, ulcers in the second and third parts of the duodenum, and a tumor of 2.5 cm is suggestive of gastrinoma, causing Zollinger-Ellison syndrome. The recommended treatment option, in this case, is the surgical removal of the tumor. Management of Zollinger-Ellison syndrome (ZES): ZES is a condition that includes: Fulminating ulcer diathesis in the stomach, duodenum, or atypical sites. Recurrent ulceration despite adequate therapy. Non-beta islet cell tumors of the pancreas (gastrinoma) . In MEN 1/gastrinoma: Tumors >2 cm : Surgery is recommended (enucleation). For small tumors, proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) are the treatment of choice. Even when patients undergo a surgical cure, most (60%) require continued medical treatment. Proton pump inhibitors are started at higher doses (60 mg in divided doses over a 24-hour period) . Other drugs used: Somatostatin analogues: Octreotide , lanreotide. Metastatic tumors: Interferon- I . Systemic chemotherapy: Streptozotocin, 5-fluorouracil, and doxorubicin. After initiation of medical therapy, dosing should be adjusted to maintain basal acid output levels. Patients who have not had surgery: <10 mEq/hr. Patients who have had an acid-reducing surgery: <5 mEq/hr. PPIs (Option A) are used in the initial management of the disease. Omeprazole + Clarithromycin + Amoxicillin (Option B) is a regimen for H. pylori infection. It has no role in the management of ZES/gastrinoma as H. pylori is not an etiology for ZES . Radiofrequency ablation (Option D) can be used in refractory cases.

      "question": "A 45-year-old man presents with recurrent upper abdominal pain and frequent episodes of reflux. He also reports unintended weight loss from the past three months. Endoscopy reveals multiple duodenal ulcers. Further tests confirmed Zollinger-Ellison Syndrome (ZES). Which of the following statements regarding the management of ZES is false?",
      "options": {
        "A": "Proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) are the mainstay of treatment.",
        "B": "Surgical resection of gastrinoma is curative in all cases.",
        "C": "High-dose PPI therapy can effectively control acid hypersecretion.",
        "D": "Somatostatin analogues can be used as adjunctive therapy to control symptoms."
      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "found in the pancreas or duodenum. These tumors lead to hypergastrinemia and excessive gastric acid production. While surgical resection is indicated in some cases, it is not curative in all. Surgical resection can be curative only if metastasis is absent. Treatment involves proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) for acid suppression, high-dose PPI therapy for acid control, and somatostatin analogues as adjunctive therapy (Option D). Management includes: Proton Pump Inhibitors (PPIs): These medications are the mainstay of treatment for ZES. They work by reducing the production of stomach acid and helping to alleviate symptoms such as peptic ulcers, reflux, and related complications. Commonly prescribed PPIs include omeprazole, esomeprazole, lansoprazole, and pantoprazole (Option A). H2-Receptor Antagonists: In some cases, H2-receptor antagonists like ranitidine or famotidine may be used in combination with PPIs to further decrease acid production and control symptoms. Gastrinoma Localization: If the gastrinoma (the tumor causing excessive gastrin production) can be located, surgical removal may be considered. This is particularly relevant if the tumor is causing severe symptoms, is malignant, or is not responding adequately to medical therapy. Endoscopic Procedures: Endoscopy may be performed to evaluate and manage complications such as bleeding ulcers or to obtain biopsies for diagnosis. Nutritional Support: Patients with ZES may require nutritional support, especially if they experience malabsorption due to chronic diarrhea or other gastrointestinal issues. This may include dietary counseling, supplementation with vitamins or minerals, or in severe cases, enteral nutrition. Reference: Goldman-Cecil Medicine, 26th Edition, Page 1018-1020",

      "question": "A middle-aged woman presents with acidity, abdominal pain, diarrhea, and weight loss for the past few months. Her symptoms are not relieved by taking antacids. An endoscopic evaluation shows ulcers on the second part of the duodenum. Which of the following conditions should be suspected in this patient?",
      "options": {
        "A": "Stress ulcers",
        "B": "Zollinger-Ellison syndrome",
        "C": "H. pylori infection",
        "D": "Malignant duodenal ulcer"
      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "location of ulcers are highly suggestive of Zollinger-Ellison syndrome. ZES is a peptic ulcer syndrome caused by unregulated gastrin release from a neuroendocrine tumour/gastrinoma. About 60% of the tumours are malignant. The clinical presentation of ZES is very similar to that of peptic ulcer disease. The features which help in suspecting ZES include: Unusual location- The second part of the duodenum and beyond. Refractory to medical therapy Recurrence after acid-reducing surgery Presenting with complications like bleeding and perforations Not associated with H. PYLORI or NSAID ingestion Patients of ZES often have associated diarrhea and involvement of the esophagus(esophagitis, ulceration, or stricture) Diagnostic tests in Zollinger Ellison syndrome: Gastric pH < 3 Serum gastrin >1000 pg/ml Secretin stimulation test (most sensitive and specific gastrin provocation test) An increase in gastrin of ≥ 120 pg within 15 min of secretin injection BAO (basal acid output) >15 mEq/h (normal: <5 mEq/h) BAO: MAO (maximal acid output) ratio Increased ( >0.6 ) Localization of the tumor CT or MRI- Initial Investigation Endoscopic ultrasound- BEST investigation PET-CT with 68 Ga-DOTATATE (sensitivity & specificity is >90%) Stress ulcers (Option A): Typically occur in critically ill or hospitalized patients (e.g., ICU, trauma, burns). These are usually multiple, shallow, and in the stomach, not the distal duodenum. H. pylori infection (Option C): A common cause of duodenal ulcers, but usually affects the first part of the duodenum and responds to acid suppression and antibiotics. Not typically associated with diarrhea. Malignant duodenal ulcer (Option D): Rare; duodenal ulcers are typically benign. Malignancy would more often be suspected in gastric ulcers, not in the second part of the duodenum. Reference: Harrison Principles of Internal Medicine, 21st Edition, Page 2453",
