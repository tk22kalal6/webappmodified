      },
      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), a chronic idiopathic inflammatory disease of the gastrointestinal tract. Pathogenesis: Crohn’s disease pathogenesis is based on tissue inflammation caused by an unrestrainable immune response against luminal bacterial antigens. In IBD, the intestinal epithelial layer has excessive permeability that allows pathogens to leak through to the underlying mucosal layers. It is this that triggers an autoimmune reaction with persistent activation of immune cells. Clinical Features: It can affect any part of the GIT from the mouth to the anus ; the terminal ileum is most commonly involved , and the rectum is spared. It is characterised by transmural inflammation and skip lesions throughout the affected intestine. It presents with symptoms such as abdominal pain, diarrhea, weight loss, and occasionally rectal bleeding. Perianal manifestations, including fistulas and abscesses , occur in about one-third of CD patients, particularly those with colonic involvement. Investigations: Colonoscopy may show deep linear serpiginous ulcers , especially in the terminal ileum. Histologically, noncaseating granulomas are a hallmark feature of CD. Bowel wall thickening, fibrosis, and strictures lead to recurrent bowel obstructions. Ulcerative colitis (Option A): Ulcerative colitis is also a type of Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD), that presents with abdominal pain, diarrhea, and rectal bleeding as it primarily affects the colon and almost always involves the rectum with broad areas of ulceration. Skip lesions, bowel wall thickening, and perianal manifestations like fissures and granulomas are uncommon in Ulcerative colitis. Celiac disease (Option B): Celiac disease is an autoimmune disorder caused by gluten hypersensitivity due to ingestion of gluten protein present in wheat, barley, and rye. It causes damage to the villi in the small intestine, resulting in villous atrophy . This condition has a strong association with HLA-DQ2 and HLA-DQ8. Symptoms include diarrhea, weight loss, and abdominal pain. Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS)(Option D): It is a functional gastrointestinal disorder characterised by abdominal pain or discomfort associated with altered bowel habits. While it may present with some overlapping symptoms like abdominal pain and diarrhoea, it does not lead to",

        "D": "Pseudomembranous colitis"
      },
      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "Correct answer: A) Ulcerative colitis Explanation: Backwash ileitis is a condition primarily associated with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), specifically Ulcerative colitis (UC) which primarily affects the colon and rectum. In ulcerative colitis, when inflammation affects the entire colon, about 10–20% of patients experience a condition called backwash ileitis. This involves the inflammation extending 2–3 cm retrogradely from the colon into the terminal ileum. It is characterized by mild endoscopic changes and microscopic abnormalities, including villous atrophy, crypt regeneration, and increased inflammation in the terminal ileum. Risk factors for backwash ileitis include extensive colitis and primary sclerosing cholangitis. Crohn's disease (Option B) is an IBD that affects any part of the gastrointestinal tract. While it commonly involves the ileum, backwash ileitis is specifically associated with ulcerative colitis. The presence of granulomas in the terminal ileum biopsies supports a Crohn's disease diagnosis. Diverticulitis (Option C) is an inflammation or infection of small pouches called diverticula that can form along the walls of the intestines, typically in the lower part of the colon. Backwash ileitis is not typically associated with diverticulitis. Pseudomembranous colitis(Option D) is typically caused by Clostridium difficile infection, often resulting from overuse of antibiotics. It primarily affects the colon and can lead to severe inflammation and the formation of pseudomembranes on the mucosal lining.

Complications of Ulcerative colitis Complications of Crohn’s disease Toxic megacolon Intestinal perforation Anaemia Colonic malignancy (UC is a premalignant condition) Perianal fistula Abscess Malabsorption syndrome Strictures Intestinal obstruction Malabsorption syndrome (Option A) occurs in Crohn’s disease because of damage to the mucosa of the jejunum and ileum. This prevents nutrients from being absorbed, resulting in multiple nutrient deficiencies, such as Vitamin B12, Vitamin K, Folic acid, Albumin, Calcium, and Magnesium. Perianal fistula (Option B): Due to the transmural inflammation in Crohn’s disease, serosal adhesions develop that provide direct pathways for fistula formation and reduce the incidence of free perforation. Intestinal obstruction (Option C) : Chronic inflammation and scarring of the intestinal wall in Crohn’s disease can lead to the formation of strictures, narrowing the intestinal lumen and causing bowel obstruction.

      "correct_answer": "D",
      "explanation": "Elevated levels of fecal calprotectin indicate intestinal inflammation and are useful for distinguishing between Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and non-inflammatory conditions such as irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). Another sensitive marker useful in detecting intestinal inflammation is Fecal lactoferrin, a glycoprotein present in activated neutrophils. Anti-tissue Transglutaminase Antibodies (Option A): Elevated levels of anti-tissue transglutaminase antibodies (anti-tTG) indicate an immune response to gluten, a protein found in wheat, barley, and rye.

      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "membrane porin protein C (OmpC), I2, and anti-flagellin (anti-CBir1) may have a more aggressive disease course and a shorter time to complications, such as internal perforating and/or stricturing disease. Serological Markers in Crohn's Disease (CD) Serological Markers in Ulcerative Colitis (UC) 1. Anti-Saccharomyces cerevisiae antibodies (ASCAs): Found in approximately 60-70% of CD patients. Lower prevalence (10-15%) in UC patients. Associated with increased risk of small bowel involvement and fibrostenosing disease phenotype. 1. Perinuclear antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies (pANCAs): Positive in around 60-70% of UC patients. Much lower prevalence (5-10%) in CD patients. Associated with increased risk of UC development and may aid in differentiating UC from CD. 2. Antibodies to Escherichia coli outer membrane porin protein C (OmpC): Positive in about 55% of CD patients. Linked to more aggressive disease behaviour and internal penetrating complications. 2. Other Antibodies: While less commonly used, serological markers like anti-colon antibodies have been investigated in UC but are not as clinically impactful as pANCAs. ASCA (Anti-Saccharomyces cerevisiae antibody) 3. Antibodies to bacterial homologs (I2 and anti-CBir1): I2 antibodies are found in 50-54% of CD patients. Anti-CBir1 antibodies are identified in approximately 50% of CD patients. The presence of these antibodies may indicate a more aggressive disease and a shorter time to complications. Serological markers, such as ASCA and pANCA, can help differentiate between CD and UC, though they are not definitive diagnostic tools. Positive serological markers in CD (e.g., ASCA, OmpC) are associated with specific disease phenotypes and complications. Serologic testing may have limited utility in predicting disease course or guiding therapy compared to clinical factors and imaging studies. Reduced risk of aggressive CD progression (Option A) is incorrect because this serologic profile suggests increased—not reduced—risk of aggressive disease. Indication for immediate surgical intervention (Option C) is not based solely on serology; it's reserved for complications. Unlikely progression to CD based on serologic markers IIIIIII (Option D) is incorrect because these markers actually support the likelihood of CD, not rule it out.

Granular mucosal ulcers appear as discrete, superficial ulcers with a granular appearance on colonoscopy; they typically involve the rectum and sigmoid colon. Collar stud ulcerations (Option A) are a characteristic feature of Crohn's disease rather than Ulcerative colitis. These ulcers are deeper and have a cobblestone appearance, often surrounded by normal mucosa, which distinguishes them from the superficial and diffuse ulcerations seen in Ulcerative Colitis. Loss of haustrations (Option C) refers to the smooth appearance of the colon due to inflammation and oedema of the colonic wall, which obscure the normal colonic markings. It is also known as a pipestem colon. While this finding can occur in ulcerative colitis, it is not typically one of the earliest signs and may develop as the disease progresses. Toxic megacolon (Option D) is a serious complication of Ulcerative colitis characterised by severe inflammation and dilation of the colon, leading to systemic toxicity and potential perforation.

      "explanation": "colonoscopy findings of aphthous ulceration and skip lesions are characteristic of Crohn's disease. Pelvic magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) would be preferred to better visualize and characterize peri-rectal fistulas and other complications in a patient with Crohn’s disease. MRI offers superior soft tissue contrast and detailed anatomical information without radiation exposure. Small-bowel follow-through (SBFT) (Option A) primarily focuses on imaging the small bowel. It involves ingestion of a barium solution followed by radiologic imaging to track the passage of the contrast material through the small intestine. SBFT can help evaluate small bowel involvement in Crohn's disease and identify active inflammation, strictures, masses, and diverticula, but it is not suitable for visualizing peri-rectal fistulas or complications in the pelvic region. Enteroclysis (Option B): This procedure involves administering contrast directly into the small bowel through a nasoenteric tube. Similar to SBFT, enteroclysis is primarily used to image the small bowel and detect pathologies such as obstructions and mucosal abnormalities. Computed tomography enterography (CTE) (Option C): While CTE can provide detailed images of the small bowel and detect complications such as strictures and inflammation, it may not offer optimal soft tissue contrast for accurately visualizing peri-rectal fistulas or detecting subtle abnormalities in the pelvic region.

The given clinical scenario and image are suggestive of Pyoderma gangrenosum which is more common in Ulcerative colitis compared to Crohn’s disease. (Option B) Primary Sclerosing Cholangitis (PSC) is more common in Ulcerative colitis than Crohn’s disease (Option C) . It is characterised by chronic intrahepatic and extrahepatic bile duct inflammation, leading to fibrosis and scarring.

      "explanation": "B12 and folate), and imaging shows deep serpiginous ulcers in the jejunum and ileum , which are characteristic of Crohn's disease . A common extraintestinal manifestation of Crohn’s, especially with small bowel involvement and fat malabsorption, is hyperoxaluria , which increases the risk for calcium oxalate kidney stones (nephrolithiasis) . Reasons for Hyperoxaluria with nephrolithiasis in malabsorption syndrome are: Due to Crohn's disease, structural damage or alterations in the small intestine's absorptive surface can occur resulting in increased absorption of dietary oxalate from the gastrointestinal tract into the bloodstream. Dysbiosis (Changes in the composition of gut microbiota, often seen in malabsorption syndromes) may also lead to decreased oxalate degradation by gut bacteria, further contributing to increased oxalate levels. Malabsorption syndromes can lead to deficiencies in calcium, which normally binds to oxalate in the gastrointestinal tract, preventing its absorption. Reduced calcium availability may result in more free oxalate being absorbed into the bloodstream. Bile acids play a role in the solubilization and excretion of oxalate in the intestine. Malabsorption syndromes can disrupt bile acid metabolism, potentially leading to impaired oxalate excretion and increased absorption. Other manifestations that can occur in Crohn’s disease due to malabsorption are: Reduction in albumin levels results in protein-losing enteropathy. Lowered levels of calcium and magnesium occur. Coagulopathy may develop due to vitamin K deficiency. Extraintestinal manifestations of IBD: Erythema nodosum (A skin condition characterized by painful red nodules typically found on the shins).
