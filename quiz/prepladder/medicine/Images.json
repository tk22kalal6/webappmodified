Both are inherited in an autosomal recessive fashion and present with bleeding symptoms in childhood. Thrombotic Thrombocytopenic Purpura : The pathogenesis of inherited (Upshaw-Schulman syndrome) and idiopathic TTP (ITTP) is related to a deficiency of, or antibodies to, the metalloprotease ADAMTS13, which cleaves VWF. VWF is normally secreted as ultra-large multimers, which are then cleaved by ADAMTS13. The persistence of ultra-large VWF molecules is thought to contribute to pathogenic platelet adhesion and aggregation Therapeutic plasma exchange (TPE) remains the mainstay of treatment of TTP. TPE is continued until the platelet count is normal and signs of hemolysis are resolved for at least 2 days. Hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS) is a syndrome characterized by acute renal failure, microangiopathic hemolytic anemia, and thrombocytopenia. It is seen preceded by an episode of diarrhea, often hemorrhagic in nature, predominantly in children. Escherichia coli O157:H7 is the most frequent etiologic serotype. Atypical HUS (aHUS) is usually due to genetic defects in complement genes or antibodies directed against complementary regulatory proteins that result in chronic complement activation.

Von Willebrand Disease : Autosomal dominant disorder caused by mutations in vWF, a large protein that promotes the adhesion of platelets to subendothelial collagen and stabilizes factor VIII Type 1 and type 3 von Willebrand disease are associated with quantitative defects in vWF Type 1, an autosomal dominant disorder characterized by a mild to moderate vWF deficiency. It is associated with point substitutions that interfere with maturation of the vWF protein or that result in rapid clearance from the plasma. Type 3 disease is an autosomal disorder usually caused by deletions or frameshift mutations resulting in little to no vWF synthesis. Because vWF stabilizes factor VIII in the circulation, factor VIII levels are also reduced in type 3 disease and the associated bleeding disorder is often severe. Type 2 von Willebrand disease is characterized by qualitative defects in vWF ; there are several subtypes, of which type 2A is the most common . It is inherited as an autosomal dominant disorder. 2. Hemophilia A , the most common hereditary disease associated with life-threatening bleeding, is caused by mutations in factor VIII , an essential cofactor for factor IX in the coagulation cascade. Hemophilia A is inherited as an X-linked recessive trait and thus affects mainly males and homozygous females. Patients with hemophilia A have a prolonged PTT and a normal PT, results that point to an abnormality of the intrinsic coagulation pathway. Factor VIII–specific assays are required for diagnosis Hemophilia A is treated with infusions of recombinant factor VIII. 3. Hemophilia B (Christmas Disease, Factor IX Deficiency) Severe factor IX deficiency produces a disorder clinically indistinguishable from factor VIII deficiency it is inherited as an X-linked recessive trait The PTT is prolonged and the PT is normal. Diagnosis of Christmas disease is possible only by assay of the factor levels. The disease is treated with infusions of recombinant factor IX. 4. Osler weber rendu disease / Hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT) is characterized by the presence of multiple arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) that lack intervening capillaries and result in direct connections between arteries and veins. The most common clinical manifestation is spontaneous and recurrent nosebleeds (epistaxis) beginning on average at age 12 years. Telangiectasia (small AVMs) are characteristically found on the lips, tongue, buccal and gastrointestinal (GI) mucosa, face, and fingers. 5. Factor XIII (FXIII) deficiency / Laki lorand factor deficiency is a rare bleeding disorder that presents with symptoms spanning from delayed umbilical cord separation to intracranial hemorrhage. FXIII plays a pivotal role in stabilizing clots and facilitating the cross-linking of the fibrin polymer, thereby ensuring effective hemostasis The acquired FXIII deficiency typically arises from factors such as hyperconsumption, hemodilution, and decreased synthesis and is more prevalent than the congenital form.

Over the last few days, he has noticed easy bruising, petechiae on his legs, and gum bleeding. He denies any history of trauma and he does not have any signs of active bleeding. On examination, he has petechiae on his extremities and ecchymosis.

        "D": "Disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC)"
      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "for tuberculosis treatment, which strongly suggests drug-induced thrombocytopenia . Drugs can induce thrombocytopenia through direct effects on platelets and secondary to immunologically mediated platelet destruction. The drugs most commonly implicated are quinine, quinidine, and vancomycin, all of which induce drug-dependent antibody binding to platelet glycoproteins. Clinically, these patients present with moderate to severe thrombocytopenia, and spontaneous bleeding varying from simple ecchymoses, petechiae and mucosal bleeding to life-threatening spontaneous intracranial hemorrhage. There are two types of drug-induced thrombocytopenia: immune and nonimmune. If a medicine causes your immune system to produce antibodies which seek and destroy your platelets, the condition is called drug-induced immune thrombocytopenia . Heparin , a blood thinner, is the most common cause of drug-induced immune thrombocytopenia. If a medicine prevents your bone marrow from making enough platelets, the condition is called drug-induced non immune thrombocytopenia . Chemotherapy drugs and a seizure medicine called valproic acid may lead to this problem. Other medicines that cause drug-induced thrombocytopenia include: Furosemide Gold, used to treat arthritis Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) Penicillin Quinidine Quinine Ranitidine Sulfonamides Linezolid and other antibiotics Statins Rifampin Treatment The first step is to stop using the medicine that is causing the problem. For people who have life-threatening bleeding, treatments may include: Immunoglobulin therapy (IVIG) Plasma exchange (plasmapheresis) Platelet transfusions Corticosteroid medicine Heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT) (Option A) :HIT is a well-known cause of thrombocytopenia that occurs after exposure to heparin . It is caused by the formation of antibodies against the heparin-platelet factor 4 complex , which activates platelets and leads to thrombosis and thrombocytopenia . Immune thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP) (Option C) :ITP is an autoimmune disorder in which the body's immune system produces antibodies against platelets, leading to destruction of platelets in the spleen. The most common presenting symptoms are petechiae , easy bruising , and gum bleeding . Disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) (Option D) : The classic findings of DIC include low platelet count , prolonged PT and aPTT , increased D-dimer , and organ dysfunction (e.g., renal or liver failure).",

(Option A) Immunosuppressive therapy: Rituximab Intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIgG) (Option B): It can temporarily increase platelet counts in patients with ITP by inhibiting the destruction of platelets. It is usually used in acute ITP, where a rapid increase in platelet count is needed. Since this patient has chronic ITP and is not in a life-threatening situation, IVIgG is less suitable for treatment compared to options like Eltrombopag. Platelet transfusion (Option C): It is not effective in patients with ITP because the immune system continues to destroy the transfused platelets as it does with the patient’s own platelets. It is reserved for cases of life-threatening bleeding or emergency situations, not for routine management of chronic ITP. This option is incorrect. High-dose prednisolone (Option D): This patient has already been on prednisolone, and the persistence of symptoms suggests that he is refractory to corticosteroid treatment. Escalating the dose of prednisolone is not advisable due to potential adverse effects.
