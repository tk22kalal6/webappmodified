      },
      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: A) Type 1 Autoimmune Hepatitis Explanation: Type 1 Autoimmune Hepatitis is characterized by the presence of ANA and ASMA antibodies, along with the typical histological findings of interface hepatitis and plasma cell infiltration. It is the most common form of autoimmune hepatitis and is often seen in women. Autoimmune Hepatitis: It is a chronic disorder characterized by continuing hepatocellular necrosis and inflammation, usually with fibrosis, which can progress to cirrhosis and liver failure. It is also known as Interface hepatitis because there is maximum inflammation at periportal hepatocytes. Pathophysiology : Progressive liver injury results from a cell-mediated immunologic attack on liver cells due to loss of immunologic tolerance to self-liver antigens. Genetic Predisposition : Autoimmune hepatitis has an inherited predisposition, often triggered by environmental factors (e.g., chemicals, drugs like minocycline, or viral infections like HAV, HBV, HCV, EBV). Histopathological Findings : Liver lesions consist predominantly of cytotoxic T cells and plasma cells. Autoantibodies : Commonly observed autoantibodies include antinuclear antibodies (ANA), anti-smooth muscle antibodies (ASMA), and others. Genetic Markers : HLA haplotypes (e.g., HLA-B1, B8, DR3, DR4) and polymorphisms in CTLA-4 and TNF- α are associated with autoimmune hepatitis. Conditions associated with autoimmune hepatitis: Autoimmune thyroiditis Rheumatoid arthritis Autoimmune hemolytic anemia Ulcerative colitis Membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis Juvenile diabetes mellitus Vitiligo Celiac disease Sjögren’s syndrome Types of Autoimmune hepatitis: Type 1 Autoimmune Hepatitis Type 2 Autoimmune Hepatitis More common in females (2nd-3rd decade) More common in children Associated with: ANA (also seen in SLE) - hence, lupoid hepatitis Anti SMA (Anti smooth muscle antibody) - against actin Anti-soluble liver",

      },
      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: A) Splenomegaly Explanation: Splenomegaly is commonly associated with autoimmune hepatitis due to portal hypertension and liver dysfunction. Clinical features of Autoimmune hepatitis include: Initially, the patient is asymptomatic. On Routine LFT: SGPT is raised. Symptomatic: Non-specific symptoms - Fatigue, anorexia, acne, amenorrhea Hepatomegaly, Splenomegaly Pruritus, hyperpigmentation, weight loss Jaundice (Waxing and waning course) SICCA syndrome (Dry eyes and mouth) Erythema nodosum Cirrhosis: Initially compensated, then decompensated (Ascites, pedal edema, variceal bleeding). Incidence of HCC is increased. Weight gain (Option B) : Weight gain is not typical; patients usually experience weight loss due to anorexia and systemic symptoms. Presence of anti-mitochondrial antibodies (AMA) (Option C) : AMA is primarily associated with primary biliary cholangitis, not autoimmune hepatitis. Elevated alkaline phosphatase levels (Option D) : Elevated alkaline phosphatase is usually indicative of cholestatic liver disease and is not a common feature of autoimmune hepatitis.

        "B": "Albumin",
        "C": "It is a diagnosis of exclusion",
        "D": "RA factor is negative"
      },
      "correct_answer": "D",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: D) RA factor is negative Explanation: Rheumatoid factor (RF) is an autoantibody that is primarily associated with rheumatoid arthritis but can also be found in various autoimmune conditions, including Autoimmune Hepatitis (AIH). In AIH, the presence of RF may indicate a broader autoimmune process rather than being specific to liver disease. Autoimmune hepatitis - Work Up: LFT : Serum bilirubin might be increased. SGPT : Significantly raised. (Option A ruled out) Serum alkaline phosphatase normal or raised. Albumin ↓ and γ -globulin ↑↑ (Option B ruled out) (change in albumin globulin ratio), as no catabolism of this protein occurs, it keeps elevating. Viral serology for Hepatitis A, B and C · PT is increased. RA factor is positive. (Option D) ANA positive, Anti SMA (actin), Anti LKM-1 , Liver cytosol 1 antibody. Liver Biopsy: Interface hepatitis Rosette formation (indicates regenerating hepatocytes) Diagnostic Criteria for Autoimmune Hepatitis: It is a diagnosis of exclusion (Option C ruled out) Exclusion of Other Causes: Must rule out liver disease from genetic disorders, viral hepatitis, drug toxicity, and alcohol. Key Diagnostic Features: Hyperglobulinemia: Elevated globulin levels. Autoantibodies: Presence of various autoantibodies (e.g., ANA, ASMA, LKM1). Histological Findings: Characteristic features such as interface hepatitis, plasma cells, and rosettes. Factors supporting diagnosis: Factors against diagnosis: Female gender. Predominant elevation of aminotransferases. Level of globulin elevation. Presence of other autoimmune diseases. HLA-DR3 or DR4 markers. Positive response to treatment. Predominant elevation of alkaline phosphatase. Presence of mitochondrial antibodies. Positive markers for viral hepatitis. History of hepatotoxic drug use or excessive alcohol consumption. Histological evidence of bile duct injury or atypical features (e.g., fatty infiltration, iron overload). Management: Mainstay of Treatment: Glucocorticoid therapy (prednisone or prednisolone) is the primary treatment. Common initial dose: 60 mg/day of prednisone, tapered to 20 mg/day over one month. Alternative: Start with 30 mg/day of prednisone + 50 mg/day of azathioprine . Benefits of Combination Therapy: Reduces serious complications of steroid therapy (e.g., Cushing's, hypertension) from 66% to <20%. Azathioprine alone is ineffective for remission but can help maintain it after tapering steroids. Monitoring and Response: Initial improvement in fatigue, jaundice, and other symptoms occurs within days to weeks. Biochemical improvement (bilirubin and globulin levels) may take weeks to months; histologic changes can take 6–24 months. Long-term Management: Therapy should continue for at least 12–18 months ; relapse rates after cessation can be >50%. Maintenance therapy with low-dose prednisone or continuing azathioprine is often necessary to prevent relapse. Refractory Cases: Consider high-dose glucocorticoids or increased doses of azathioprine for patients not responding to standard therapy. Alternative medications: cyclosporine, tacrolimus, mycophenolate mofetil, and monoclonal antibodies (infliximab, rituximab) have shown some benefit in anecdotal cases. Liver Transplantation: Considered for patients with severe disease or those who develop cirrhosis and life-threatening complications. Early consideration for transplantation if bilirubin fails to improve after two weeks of therapy.

      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: A) Autoimmune-mediated destruction of bile ducts Explanation: PBC is characterized by autoimmune-mediated portal inflammation and necrosis of cholangiocytes in small- and medium-sized bile ducts. Antimitochondrial antibodies (AMAs) are present in ~95% of patients with PBC. Pathophysiology: Histopathologic analyses of liver biopsies reveal 4 stages: The earliest lesion is termed chronic nonsuppurative destructive cholangitis and is a necrotizing inflammatory process of the portal tracts. Medium and small bile ducts are infiltrated with lymphocytes and undergo duct destruction. Mild fibrosis and sometimes bile stasis can occur. With progression, the inflammatory infiltrate becomes less prominent, but the number of bile ducts is reduced, and there is proliferation of smaller bile ductules. Increased fibrosis ensues with the expansion of periportal fibrosis to bridging fibrosis . Finally, cirrhosis, which may be micronodular or macronodular, develops.

Fatigue: Most common and earliest manifestation Pruritus followed by lichenification of skin: When there is liver damage, the endogenous opioid peptides responsible for pruritis in these patients are produced. Jaundice and hepatomegaly Palmar erythema Spider naevi Temporal and proximal muscle wasting. Ascites, caput medusae Collaterals present Xanthoma or xanthelasma (over eyelids): LDL is elevated in these patients. Receptors of LDL uptake are hampered. Initially, LDL and HDL values are elevated. In a later stage, LDL values are elevated, and HDL value is reduced. Steatorrhea, deficiency of fat-soluble vitamins. Osteopenia: Due to vitamin D deficiency. SICCA syndrome manifestations present.

      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: A) Initiate ursodeoxycholic acid therapy Explanation: The patient’s presentation—fatigue, pruritus, elevated alkaline phosphatase, and positive antimitochondrial antibodies (AMAs)—is highly suggestive of Primary Biliary Cholangitis (PBC). Ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA) is the standard first-line treatment for PBC. It helps to improve liver function, reduce alkaline phosphatase levels, and alleviate symptoms such as pruritus. Initiating therapy with UDCA can help manage the disease and improve the patient's quality of life. Laboratory Findings in Primary Biliary Cholangitis (PBC): Elevated γ -glutamyl transpeptidase (GGT) and alkaline phosphatase (ALP). Mild elevations in aminotransferases (ALT and AST). Increased immunoglobulins, particularly IgM. Hyperbilirubinemia typically develops once cirrhosis is present. Thrombocytopenia, leukopenia, and anemia may occur due to portal hypertension and hypersplenism. Diagnosis Considerations: PBC should be considered in patients with chronic cholestatic liver enzyme abnormalities. Anti-mitochondrial antibody (AMA) testing may be negative in 5–10% of cases; these patients may have other PBC-specific autoantibodies (e.g., sp100, gp210). Liver biopsy is essential for diagnosing AMA-negative PBC. Treatment of Primary Biliary Cholangitis Ursodeoxycholic Acid (UDCA): Dosage: 13–15 mg/kg per day. Shown to improve biochemical and histologic features, slowing disease progression (but not curing it). Side effects may include worsening pruritus, diarrhea, or headache. 30–40% of patients may not respond satisfactorily to UDCA; half of these may improve with obeticholic acid. Symptom Management: Main Symptoms: Fatigue and pruritus. Pruritus treatment options: Antihistamines. Narcotic receptor antagonists (e.g., naltrexone). Rifampin. Cholestyramine (bile salt-sequestering agent) can be helpful but is cumbersome. Plasmapheresis may be used in severe, intractable pruritus. Bone Health Management: Increased risk of osteopenia and osteoporosis; bone density testing is recommended. Oral calcium and vitamin D supplementation are advised. Bisphosphonate treatment should be considered if bone disease is identified. Liver Transplantation: Consideration for liver transplantation if liver disease decompensates.

      "options": {
        "A": "Increased risk of renal toxicity.",

        "D": "Development of opioid dependency."
      },
      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: C) Greater likelihood of unintentional acetaminophen overdose. Explanation: Patients with opioid tolerance may need higher doses of opioids for pain relief, leading them to take more tablets or medication than prescribed. This can increase their acetaminophen intake beyond the recommended daily limit, raising the risk of unintentional overdose and hepatotoxicity due to acetaminophen's well-defined toxic threshold. The Rumack-Matthew nomogram is used to assess the risk of hepatotoxicity by interpreting serum acetaminophen levels in relation to the time since ingestion. Purpose of the Nomogram : Predicts the risk of hepatotoxicity based on a single acetaminophen concentration at a specific time. Not a prognostic tool; it does not predict fulminant liver failure or death. Best used for acetaminophen concentrations measured 4–24 hours after ingestion. Lines on the Nomogram : Probable (Rumack-Matthew) Line : Represents the threshold above which 60% of patients are likely to develop hepatotoxicity. Possible (Treatment) Line : Added later by the FDA, incorporating a 25% margin of error for measurement variations or uncertainty about the ingestion time. Limitations of the Nomogram : Cannot be used for patients presenting more than 24 hours after ingestion or those with multiple ingestions. Less reliable for extended-release acetaminophen or co-ingestion with agents that delay gastric emptying (e.g., anticholinergics, opioids). Safe dose of paracetamol: 3 grams per day Safe dose in the alcoholic patient: 2 grams per day Opioid-PCM combinations are dangerous, as opioid tolerance can lead to increased acetaminophen intake. (Option C) Acetaminophen in opioid combination products is limited to 325 mg per tablet. Toxic Doses : 8 g/day over several days can lead to liver failure. A single dose of 10–15 g may cause liver injury. ≥ 25 g often results in fatal fulminant liver failure. Increased risk of renal toxicity (Option A) : Acetaminophen is primarily associated with hepatotoxicity, not renal toxicity. Decreased effectiveness of acetaminophen (Option B) : Opioid tolerance affects the efficacy of opioids, not acetaminophen. The effectiveness of acetaminophen remains unchanged. Development of opioid dependency (Option D) : While chronic use of opioids can lead to dependency, this risk is not specifically tied to the combination with acetaminophen and can occur independently.",

        "D": "Inhibition of CYP2E1 by acetaminophen"
      },
      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: A) Glutathione depletion with NAPQI buildup Explanation: Acetaminophen is metabolized in the liver to form the toxic metabolite NAPQI, which is normally detoxified by glutathione . In overdose situations, excessive NAPQI depletes glutathione , leading to its accumulation and binding to hepatocyte proteins. This results in oxidative stress, mitochondrial dysfunction, and hepatocyte necrosis. The patient's symptoms of fatigue, jaundice, and elevated aminotransferases indicate significant liver injury. Metabolism of Acetaminophen Acetaminophen is mainly metabolized via phase II reactions into harmless sulfate and glucuronide metabolites. (Option B) A small portion undergoes phase I metabolism by CYP2E1 (Option D) , forming the hepatotoxic metabolite N-acetyl-p-benzoquinone-imine (NAPQI) . Detoxification of NAPQI NAPQI is neutralized by binding to glutathione, forming water-soluble mercapturic acid, which is excreted via the kidneys. Glutathione Depletion (Option C) When excessive NAPQI is produced, or glutathione is depleted (Option A) , NAPQI binds to hepatocyte macromolecules, forming acetaminophen-protein adducts, causing hepatocyte necrosis. Risk Factors Chronic alcohol use (induces CYP2E1, depletes glutathione). Starvation. Prior use of mixed-function oxidase-inducing drugs (e.g., phenobarbital , INH ). Hepatitis C infection increases the risk of liver injury in overdose. Clinical features Early Symptoms (4-12 hrs) : Nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal pain, shock. Delayed Symptoms (24-48 hrs) : Hepatic injury becomes apparent. Coagulopathy and encephalopathy. Maximal damage seen 3–5 days post-ingestion with aminotransferase levels >10,000 IU/L. Renal failure and myocardial injury may occur. Stages of acute acetaminophen poisoning Stage Time Post-Ingestion Description I 0–24 hours Nausea, vomiting, and anorexia. II 24–72 hours Right upper quadrant abdominal pain; elevated liver enzymes (AST, ALT), and sometimes increased bilirubin and INR if poisoning is severe. III 72–96 hours Vomiting, signs of liver failure; peak levels of AST, ALT, bilirubin, and INR. Possible renal failure and pancreatitis. IV > 5 days Recovery of liver function or progression to multiple organ failure.

      "explanation": "Correct Answer: B) Start intravenous N-acetylcysteine therapy. Explanation: N-acetylcysteine is the specific antidote for paracetamol poisoning , effective when administered within 8 hours to replenish hepatic glutathione and neutralize toxic metabolites. Timely NAC therapy is crucial in preventing further liver injury, especially given the patient's mild jaundice. Management of Paracetamol poisoning Management Aspect Details Initial Treatment Gastric Lavage Administer activated charcoal or cholestyramine (effective within 30 minutes of ingestion) (Option A) N-acetylcysteine (NAC) Therapy Initiate within 8 hours of ingestion; may be partially effective up to 24–36 hours post-overdose. (Option B) Administration : IV: 140 mg/kg loading dose over 1 hour, followed by 70 mg/kg every 4 hours for 15–20 doses. Mechanism of Action NAC acts as a sulfhydryl donor, replenishing glutathione. Neutralizes toxic metabolites and prevents binding to cell proteins, reducing the severity of hepatic necrosis. Liver Transplantation (Option D) Considered in cases of hepatic failure (jaundice, coagulopathy, confusion). King's College Criteria is used to predict the need for a liver transplant in patients with paracetamol-induced acute liver failure : Arterial blood pH < 7.30 Or all of the following: Prothrombin time (PT) > 100 seconds (INR > 6.5) Serum creatinine > 300 µ mol/L Grade III or IV hepatic encephalopathy.

Stage V Bowel Obstruction 2 to 8 weeks Consequences of healing, including scarring and obstruction of the pylorus or proximal bowel. Stages can progress rapidly, and not all patients experience every stage. The determination of the toxicity stage should be based on symptoms and clinical signs, not the timing of ingestion. Management of Iron Toxicity Treatment Aspect Details Activated Charcoal Ineffective for iron toxicity. Magnesium Hydroxide 1% oral solution may reduce iron absorption by forming ferrous hydroxide. Therapeutic doses of magnesium hydroxide and calcium carbonate antacids are safe for use. Laboratory Tests Obtain serum iron, creatinine, electrolytes, hemoglobin, prothrombin time, liver function tests, and arterial blood gas in severely poisoned patients. Corrective Measures Correct hypovolemia and metabolic acidosis. Chelation Therapy Agents: Desferrioxamine (IV) or deferiprone (oral). Indications: Multiple vomiting episodes, significant abdominal pain, hypovolemia, acidosis. Multiple radiopacities on X-ray. Serum iron > 350 mcg/100 ml. Dosage (Desferrioxamine): IV: Continuous infusion up to 15 mg/kg/hr (up to 35 mg/kg/hr for severe cases in children) Total Daily Dose: Do not exceed 6 grams. Infusion Duration: 8-12 hours for moderate toxicity; > 24 hours for severe toxicity. Therapy Endpoint Monitor urine for \"vin rose\" color indicating chelated iron excretion. Therapy can stop when urine color normalizes and the patient is asymptomatic. Adverse Effects of Desferrioxamine Risk of sepsis (Yersinia enterocolitica, mucormycosis) visual toxicity (low iron stores) ototoxicity (abnormal audiograms), Pulmonary toxicity (high doses) Hypotension (rate-related) Renal toxicity (elevated creatinine). Additional Treatments Continuous arteriovenous hemofiltration (CAVH) for severe poisoning. Liver transplantation for fulminant hepatic failure.
