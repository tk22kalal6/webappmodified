      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "→ Val (6) Correct Answer: A) Glu → Val (6) Explanation: Sickle cell anemia is a genetic disorder caused by a missense mutation in the β -globin gene. This mutation replaces the normal glutamic acid (Glu) at position 6 of the β -globin chain with valine (Val). This Glu → Val substitution leads to the formation of hemoglobin S (HbS), which tends to polymerize when deoxygenated, causing the red blood cells to become sickle-shaped. These sickle-shaped cells are rigid and prone to breaking, leading to anemia and other complications. Pathophysiology of Sickle cell anemia HbS Polymerisation: A single-nucleotide polymorphism in the β -globin gene results in the substitution of valine for glutamic acid at the sixth position in the β -globin chain. This mutation leads to the formation of mutated hemoglobin (HbS). After deoxygenation, HbS molecules polymerize to form bundles. These polymer bundles cause erythrocytes to adopt a sickle shape and also promote hemolysis of erythrocyte, releasing cell-free Hb into circulation. Vaso-occlusion: Sickled erythrocytes impair blood flow and aggregate with neutrophils, platelets, and endothelial cells, causing stasis. Leads to ischemia-reperfusion (I-R) injury. Endothelial Dysfunction: Oxygenated Hb (Fe² I ) depletes endothelial nitric oxide (NO), forming nitrate (NO II ) and methemoglobin (Fe³ I ). Free radicals are generated by NADPH oxidase, xanthine oxidase (XO), and uncoupled endothelial NO synthase (eNOS) contribute to endothelial damage and dysfunction. Methemoglobin (Fe³ I ) breaks down, releasing cell-free heme, which is a major erythrocyte damage-associated molecular pattern (DAMP). Sterile Inflammation: Cell-free heme or ischemia-reperfusion injury triggers sterile inflammation by: Generating reactive oxygen species (ROS). Activating Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4). Inducing neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs). Releasing DAMPs, DNA, and other unidentified factors. This activates the inflammasome pathway, releasing IL-1 β . Sterile inflammation enhances the adhesiveness of neutrophils, platelets, and endothelial cells. This creates a cycle that promotes further vaso-occlusion.",

        "D": "Von Willebrand disease"
      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: B) Glanzmann thrombasthenia Explanation: In this scenario, the clinical history and laboratory findings are consistent with Glanzmann Thrombasthenia, a congenital platelet disorder characterized by defective platelet aggregation due to a lack of Gp IIb/IIIa receptors (aids in platelet-platelet adhesion). rFVIIa is helpful for patients who are undergoing surgery or are refractory to platelet transfusions as it enhances thrombin generation at the site of vascular injury and can promote hemostasis despite platelet dysfunction. Glanzmann Thrombasthenia Congenital bleeding disorder History of high consanguinity in marriage of the parents Pathology: Autosomal recessive inheritance Mutations involving chromosome 17 Absence of the platelet Gp IIb/IIIa receptor These receptors are essential for platelet aggregation and hemostasis Clinical Features: Lifelong mucocutaneous bleeding episodes Epistaxis is very common in children Gingival bleeds Gastrointestinal bleeding Menorrhagia Investigations: Tests Results aPTT, PT, and ristocetin cofactor activity Normal Bleeding time Increased Light transmission aggregometry (LTA) (gold standard test) Altered platelet aggregation with ADP, collagen, and epinephrine. Normal aggregation with ristocetin. Flow cytometry Defective expression of alpha IIb beta 3 integrin Molecular genetic tests Gene mutations in ITGA2B or ITGB3 Treatment: Therapy Clinical setting Desmopressin Mild bleeding Platelets and/or recombinant activated clotting factor VII (rFVIIa) Surgery prophylaxis Tranexamic acid Mucocutaneous bleeding Recombinant FVIIa Platelet refractoriness cases Platelet transfusions have the risk of alloimmunization. So, HLA-matched single donor platelets for transfusion are preferred. Bernard-Soulier syndrome (BSS) (Option A), also referred to as Hemorrhagiparous Thrombolytic Dystrophy, is a rare genetic bleeding disorder marked by the presence of abnormally large platelets, a low platelet count (thrombocytopenia), and extended bleeding time. It usually presents at birth and continues throughout life. Hemophilia A (Option C): Severe haemophilia typically presents in the first few months of life, while mild or moderate forms are usually detected later in childhood or adolescence, often incidentally or after trauma, with two-thirds of cases confirmed shortly after the birth of an affected son to a carrier mother. The aPTT is abnormally elevated with a normal PT. Not all individuals with von Willebrand disease (Option D) experience clinically significant bleeding issues, leading many cases to go undiagnosed. In the coagulation profile, aPTT may be prolonged and PT is normal.

      "question": "A 30-year-old female with a history of recurrent headaches presented for further evaluation. On further workup, haemoglobin and total WBC count were normal, while an elevated platelet count was seen. Bone marrow aspiration showed increased megakaryocytes and a JAK2 mutation. Which is the most likely diagnosis?",
      "options": {
        "A": "Polycythemia vera",
        "B": "Essential thrombocytosis",
        "C": "Primary myelofibrosis",
        "D": "Chronic myelogenous leukaemia"
      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: B) Essential thrombocytosis Explanation: The high platelet count and JAK 2 mutation with increased megakaryocytes in the bone marrow aspiration point to the diagnosis of essential thrombocythemia. Essential Thrombocythemia (ET) This is a type of myeloproliferative neoplasm. Aetiology: Caused by mutations in JAK2, CALR, or MPL genes, known as \"driver mutations.\" Other mutations associated: SH2B3, TP53, IDH2, 20q-, etc. Pathophysiology: JAK2V617F mutation (valine to phenylalanine) activates hematopoietic cytokine receptors, leading to myeloproliferation. CALR mutations result in abnormal protein, affecting cellular proliferation and differentiation. MPL mutations affect thrombopoietin receptor function, increasing thrombocytosis risk. Extreme thrombocytosis (>1 million platelets) can lead to bleeding episodes due to acquired von Willebrand disease. Symptoms & Risks: Characterized by high platelet count and megakaryocytic hyperplasia in bone marrow. Risks include thrombosis, haemorrhage, and potential progression to myelofibrosis or leukemic transformation. Diagnosis: Platelet count >450,000 and presence of JAK2, CALR, or MPL mutation. Bone marrow examination may show megakaryocytic hyperplasia. Management: Cytoreduction may be necessary to manage thrombocytosis and prevent complications like thrombosis. Regular monitoring of platelet count and mutation status is key for management. Polycythemia vera (Option A) is a myeloproliferative disorder and patients have uncontrolled RBC production. These patients may have raised WBC and platelets due to stimulation of megakaryocyte and myeloid lineages but the most definite feature is the elevated RBC mass. Primary myelofibrosis (Option C): This is a myeloproliferative neoplasm leading to the deposition of fibrous connective tissue in the bone marrow resulting in bone marrow failure. Chronic myelogenous leukaemia (Option D): Characterized by the presence of the BCR-ABL1 gene, it is a type of myeloproliferative disorder mainly involving the overproduction of granulocytes. It is defined by the presence of the Philadelphia chromosome, which results from a translocation between chromosomes 9 and 22 (t(9;22)(q34;q11.2)).

      "question": "A ten-year-old boy was brought to the OPD with fever and swelling of his hands after playing football. He gives a history of previous episodes of swelling of his hands. On imaging, his spleen was found to be shrunken. Which of the following is a likely diagnosis?",
      "options": {
        "A": "Sickle cell anaemia",
        "B": "Malaria",
        "C": "Pancreatitis",
        "D": "Measles"
      },
      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: A) Sickle cell anaemia Explanation: The clinical scenario of a child with fever, recurrent swelling of the hands, and a shrunken spleen is consistent with the diagnosis of sickle cell anemia. Clinical Features of Sickle Cell Anemia: Fetal hemoglobin (HbF) persists up to 6 months of life, with a residual amount (<1%) in adulthood. In regions without newborn screening, affected children are typically identified after 6 months of age. Sickle cell disease does not predispose to neonatal jaundice. Fever: Autosplenectomy , along with reduced splenic function, increases susceptibility to infections from encapsulated bacteria: Pneumococci Meningococci H. influenzae Acute abdominal pain: Occurs during vaso-occlusion or distal tissue ischemia. Constant, non-positional abdominal pain, not aggravated by food, was located in the left upper quadrant and epigastric area. Misdiagnosed as acute pancreatitis or splenic abscess. Bone pain: Sickled cells can obstruct blood flow in blood vessels supplying the bones, leading to inadequate oxygen delivery. Lack of oxygen to bone tissue can cause cell death, leading to a complication called avascular necrosis (AVN). IOC for avascular necrosis: MRI Dactylitis/Hand and foot syndrome: Refers to painful, symmetric swelling of the hands and feet in children with sickle cell disease. It occurs due to infarction of the metacarpals, metatarsals, and phalanges caused by sickled erythrocytes blocking blood vessels. Swelling is followed by hyperemia and subperiosteal new bone formation, visible on radiographs 10-14 days after the swelling subsides. Malaria (Option B): While malaria can cause splenomegaly (enlarged spleen) due to the sequestration of parasitized red blood cells, it does not typically lead to splenic atrophy (shrunken spleen). Additionally, recurrent hand swelling is not a characteristic symptom of malaria. Pancreatitis (Option C) refers to inflammation of the pancreas, typically presenting with severe abdominal pain, nausea, and vomiting. It does not cause symptoms such as fever, hand swelling, or splenic atrophy, which are present in this patient. Measles (Option D) is a viral infection primarily affecting the respiratory system, with characteristic symptoms such as cough, coryza, conjunctivitis, and a maculopapular rash. It does not cause splenic atrophy or recurrent hand swelling, making it unlikely in this case.

      "explanation": "Correct Answer: A) Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome Explanation: Thrombocytopenia, eczema and recurrent infections are seen in Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome. Wiskott-Aldrich Syndrome X-linked recessive Caused by mutations in the gene located at Xp11.23 that encodes Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome protein (WASP) Pathology: Mutations in the WASP gene affect T lymphocytes and other lymphocyte subsets, i.e. dendritic cells, and platelets WASp regulates the actin cytoskeleton and thus plays an important role in many lymphocyte functions, including cell adhesion and migration and the formation of synapses between antigen-presenting and target cell.s Clinical Triad: Immunodeficiency, thrombocytopenia, and eczema. Clinical manifestation: Recurrent bacterial infections Eczema Bleeding Associated with IBD - Colitis Increased risk of development of malignant lymphoma Investigation: IgM levels in the serum are low, but levels of IgG are usually normal. Paradoxically the levels of IgA and IgE are often elevated Blood smear: Thrombocytopenia , reduced-sized platelets, impaired platelet aggregation. Diagnosis is made by expression of intracellular immunofluorescence analysis of WAS protein (WASp) in blood cells. There is defective or absent WAS protein. Treatment: Prophylactic antibiotics Immunoglobulin G (IgG) supplementation Topical treatment of eczema Chediak-Higashi syndrome (Option B) (CHS) is an autosomal recessive disorder characterized by recurrent pyogenic infections, partial oculocutaneous albinism, neurologic abnormalities, and thrombocytopenia. However, eczema is not a feature of CHS. Thrombocytopenia-absent radius syndrome (Option B) (TAR syndrome) is characterized by severe thrombocytopenia at birth and the absence of the radius bone in the forearm, with thumbs typically present. Eczema is not part of the presentation in TAR syndrome. Hermansky-Pudlak syndrome (Option D) involves oculocutaneous albinism, platelet dysfunction causing bleeding, pulmonary fibrosis, and granulomatous colitis. While thrombocytopenia and recurrent infections may occur, eczema is not a characteristic of this syndrome.

        "B": "Vemurafenib",
        "C": "Cladribine",
        "D": "Interferon-alpha"
      },
      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: C) Cladribine Explanation: Cladribine (also known as 2-chlorodeoxyadenosine or 2-CdA) is a purine analog chemotherapy drug that has shown high efficacy in the treatment of hairy cell leukemia. It is considered the drug of choice because it achieves high response rates and durable remissions in most patients. Deoxycoformycin is also shown to have a good remission rate. Hairy cell leukemia Mutations BRAF V600E Pathogenesis Mutation of BRAF V600E gene → Activation of the BRAF protein → MAPK/ERK signalling pathway → Uncontrolled proliferation and survival of mature B-cells (Hairy cells). Clinical Presentation Presents with fatigue, recurrent infections, easy bruising, and symptoms related to splenomegaly (e.g., early satiety, abdominal discomfort), pancytopenia Peripheral Blood Findings Hairy cells with round, oblong, or reniform nuclei and pale blue cytoplasm. Bone Marrow Biopsy Findings Hypocellular or fibrotic marrow with \"hairy cells\". Fried egg appearance. Diagnosis Flow cytometry Immunophenotyping Genetic testing for BRAF V600E mutation Treatment Splenectomy : Often leads to prolonged remission. Nucleosides (Cladribine, Deoxycoformycin) : Highly effective but cause immunosuppression; Interferon- α (Option D): Effective but less so than nucleosides. Vemurafenib (Option B) (BRAF inhibitor) : Used in chemotherapy-refractory cases; not curative but maintains response with chronic use. Vemurafenib + Rituximab (Option A) : Leads to more durable remissions. Prognosis Excellent While rituximab has shown efficacy in the treatment of various B-cell lymphomas, it is not the drug of choice for hairy cell leukemia. Cladribine is the preferred treatment for HCL. Vemurafenib is a targeted therapy drug primarily used for the treatment of certain forms of metastatic melanoma with BRAF V600E mutation. Interferon-alpha is a type of immunotherapy that has been used in the treatment of hairy cell leukemia in the past. It is now less commonly used.",

Dialysis is primarily used in cases of severe renal failure where conservative management measures have failed. Dexamethasone + lenalidomide (an immunomodulatory drug) (Option B) combination is typically included in the treatment regimen for multiple myeloma, but it is not the immediate next step. Bone marrow transplantation (Option D) is a treatment option for multiple myeloma in certain cases, particularly in younger patients or those with high-risk disease, but not the immediate next step.",

Bone marrow biopsy: Plasmacytosis >10% Clinicopathologic diagnosis of multiple myeloma is based on the following: Clonal plasma cells in bone marrow Presence of CRAB criteria (hypercalcemia, renal dysfunction, anemia and bone lesions) Metastatic breast cancer (Option A): While metastatic breast cancer can involve bones and cause hypercalcemia, the presence of monoclonal gammopathy (elevated total protein) and anemia strongly favors multiple myeloma. Primary hyperparathyroidism (Option C) is typically characterized by hypercalcemia and low phosphorus but does not cause anemia, monoclonal gammopathy, hypoalbuminemia, or osteolytic bone lesions. Milk-alkali syndrome (Option D) arises from excessive intake of calcium and alkali (often in the form of calcium supplements or vitamin D). It results in hypercalcemia, alkalosis, nephrocalcinosis, and nephrolithiasis, none of which are evident in this patient.

      "explanation": "Correct Answer: B) Phytates Explanation: Phytates are naturally occurring compounds found in certain plant foods such as whole grains, legumes, and nuts . These compounds have the ability to bind to iron and form insoluble complexes in the digestive tract, significantly reducing iron absorption and bioavailability. Factors Increasing Iron Absorption Factors Decreasing Iron Absorption Acidic stomach environment Vitamin C (ascorbic acid) (Option A Ruled Out) Empty stomach Meat proteins Citric acid Haem iron sources (meat, fish) Fermented foods Iron deficiency state Reduced stomach acid Proton pump inhibitors Antacids Tetracycline (chelates iron) Phytates (Option B) (in cereals, legumes) Tea and coffee (tannins) Calcium-rich foods High fiber meals Vitamin C (Option A): Vitamin C, also known as ascorbic acid, enhances iron absorption rather than interfering with it. It helps in the conversion of non-heme iron (the form of iron found in plant-based foods) to a more absorbable form. Oxalate (Option C): Oxalate, found in certain foods like spinach, rhubarb, and beet greens, can affect calcium absorption, but it does not affect iron absorption. While oxalates can bind to minerals, their primary impact is on calcium rather than iron metabolism. Myoglobin (Option D): Myoglobin is a protein found in muscle tissue that stores oxygen and is found in food such as meat. While myoglobin does contain iron, it is not involved in the absorption of iron from the diet.

      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: C) Multiple myeloma Explanation: Multiple myeloma is a malignant plasma cell disorder characterized by the excessive production of monoclonal immunoglobulins (M-protein) . In multiple myeloma, serum calcium levels can be elevated while SAP, PTH, and vitamin D3 levels remain normal . This occurs due to osteolytic lesions and release of calcium from damaged bone tissue due to increased osteoclast activity stimulated by cytokines produced by malignant plasma cells. The normal SAP levels in multiple myeloma help distinguish it from other bone disorders, as SAP is typically elevated in conditions with increased osteoblastic activity . In multiple myeloma, the predominant process is osteolytic rather than osteoblastic , hence SAP remains normal despite bone involvement. Diagnostic Criteria for Multiple Myeloma Presence of clonal bone marrow plasma cells or biopsy-proven bony/extramedullary plasmacytoma and anyone or more of the following myeloma-defining events: Evidence of one or more indicators of end-organ damage attributed to the plasma cell disorder, specifically: (CRAB) Hypercalcemia : Serum calcium >0.25 mmol/L above the upper limit of normal or >2.75 mmol/L (>11 mg/dL) . PTH levels, Vit-D levels are normal Renal Insufficiency : Creatinine clearance <40 mL/min or serum creatinine >177 µ mol/L (>2 mg/dL) . Anemia : Hemoglobin >20 g/L below the lower limit of normal or haemoglobin <100 g/L or <10g/100ml . Bone Lesions : One or more osteolytic lesions identified on skeletal radiography, CT, or PET-CT. Biomarkers of Malignancy (any one of the following) : Clonal bone marrow plasma cells ≥ 60%. Involved: uninvolved serum-free light chain ratio ≥ 100. 1 focal lesion on MRI studies. Serum markers: Hypercalcemia, ↑ β 2 microglobulin Vitamin D intoxication (Option A): In vitamin D intoxication, both serum calcium and vitamin D3 levels are typically elevated. Additionally, PTH levels are usually suppressed due to the negative feedback mechanism between vitamin D and PTH. Since vitamin D3 levels are normal in this case, vitamin D intoxication can be ruled out. Hyperparathyroidism (Option B): Hyperparathyroidism is characterized by increased PTH levels, which stimulate the release of calcium from bone, resulting in elevated serum calcium levels. In this case, since PTH levels are normal, hyperparathyroidism is not the likely diagnosis. Nutritional rickets (Option D): This option is incorrect as nutritional rickets is a condition caused by a deficiency of vitamin D, calcium, or phosphate. In rickets, serum calcium levels would typically be decreased rather than elevated. Additionally, vitamin D levels would be low, which is not the case here.

The patient presents with classic symptoms including headaches , easy bruising , and visual disturbances , along with the key diagnostic finding of elevated platelets with normal RBC and WBC counts . This condition results from abnormal proliferation of megakaryocytes in the bone marrow, leading to excessive platelet production.

Chronic Myeloid Leukemia (Option C) typically shows elevation in granulocytes and often an increase in platelets as well. The presence of normal WBC count makes CML an unlikely diagnosis, as it characteristically presents with marked leukocytosis. Acute Myeloid Leukemia (Option D) typically presents with abnormal levels of blood cells and can show varying counts of WBCs, RBCs, and platelets. The normal blood counts except for platelets make AML less likely, as it usually presents with cytopenias and blast cells in the peripheral blood.

The blood sample has a characteristic brownish hue on examination. As the patient has a known case of chronic stable angina, it is likely that she is on nitrates, and methemoglobinemia is a side effect of nitrate. Carboxyhemoglobinemia (Option A) results from carbon monoxide poisoning , where CO binds to hemoglobin with high affinity, reducing oxygen delivery. Patients present with cherry-red skin, headache, confusion, and severe hypoxia, but blood appears bright red, not brown . Sideroblastic anemia (Option B) is a disorder of heme synthesis , often associated with iron overload and ringed sideroblasts in the bone marrow , leading to microcytic anemia . It does not cause brown-colored blood. Sulfhemoglobinemia (Option D) is caused by sulfur-containing drugs (e.g., sulfonamides, metoclopramide) , leading to irreversible oxidation of hemoglobin and presenting with greenish/bluish blood and cyanosis , which, unlike methemoglobinemia, does not respond to methylene blue .

      "explanation": "Correct Answer: B) 1, 4 Explanation: In hemolytic anemia, excessive destruction of red blood cells leads to the following changes Indirect Van den Bergh test is positive (1): Hemolysis causes increased levels of unconjugated (indirect) bilirubin. The indirect Van den Bergh test measures this rise, making it a hallmark of hemolytic anemia. Urobilinogen is high (4): Increased hemoglobin breakdown leads to more bilirubin being converted into urobilinogen in the intestines, resulting in elevated urinary urobilinogen. Serum conjugated bilirubin is raised (2): Hemolysis results in an increase in unconjugated bilirubin, not conjugated bilirubin, which is associated with liver or biliary tract conditions. Serum transaminases are raised (3): Raised transaminases (ALT, AST) are markers of liver damage, not hemolysis. GGT is elevated (5): Gamma-glutamyl transferase (GGT) elevation is specific to liver and biliary tract pathology and is unrelated to hemolysis.

Pure Red Cell Aplasia Definition A condition characterized by anemia, reticulocytopenia, and absent or rare erythroid precursor cells in bone marrow with normal white cell and platelet production Classification Congenital: Diamond-Blackfan anemia Diagnosed at birth or early childhood Acquired: Thymoma MDS (5s- syndrome) Cancer Autoimmune conditions Viral infections (especially B19 parvovirus) Clinical Associations Thymoma (most frequent) Lymphoid malignancies Autoimmune disorders Chronic lymphocytic leukemia Systemic lupus erythematosus Pregnancy Pathophysiology T-cell mediated immune response Antibodies to erythropoietin Neutralizing antibodies to B19 parvovirus Direct chemical toxicity or immune destruction Treatment General Approach: Identify and treat underlying cause Regular monitoring of hemoglobin levels Supportive care with transfusions Specific Treatments: Immunosuppression (corticosteroids, cyclosporine, ATG, azathioprine) Intravenous immunoglobulin for B19 parvovirus infection Thymectomy if thymoma present Iron chelation as needed Aplastic Anemia (Option A) presents with pancytopenia, affecting all blood cell lines (red cells, white cells, and platelets) due to bone marrow failure. The normal reticulocyte count in this case does not support aplastic anemia, which would show decreased counts across all cell lines. Iron Deficiency Anemia (Option C) typically shows microcytic, hypochromic red blood cells with an elevated reticulocyte count as the bone marrow attempts to compensate for the iron deficiency. The normal reticulocyte count in this scenario makes iron deficiency less likely. Hemolytic Anemia (Option D) is characterized by increased destruction of red blood cells, leading to an elevated reticulocyte count as the bone marrow responds to the increased demand. The normal reticulocyte count in this case does not support ongoing hemolysis. Reference: Harrison's Principles of Internal Medicine, 21st Edition, Page 798",

      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer A - Von Willebrand disease Von Willebrand disease is the most common bleeding disorder with an autosomal dominant pattern of inheritance. It is the most common inherited bleeding disorder, caused by a deficiency or dysfunction of von Willebrand factor (vWF), a glycoprotein crucial for platelet adhesion and stabilizing factor VIII in the coagulation cascade. Functions of vWF: Platelet Adhesion: Mediates binding of platelets to subendothelial collagen at sites of vascular injury. Stabilization of Factor VIII: Protects Factor VIII from degradation, prolonging its half-life. Clinical manifestation: Superficial bruising, epistaxis, menorrhagia and gastrointestinal haemorrhage Excessive haemorrhage might only be observed after trauma or surgery Heavy menstrual bleeding Might first manifest with dental extractions, particularly wisdom tooth extraction, or tonsillectomy Investigation: Types aPTT vWF antigen vWF activity FVIII activity Multimer Inheritance 1 Normal or ↑ ↓ ↓ ↓ Normal distribution, decreased in quantity Autosomal dominant 2A Normal or ↑ ↓ ↓↓ ↓ Loss of high- and intermediate-MW multimers Autosomal dominant 2B Normal or ↑ ↓ ↓↓ ↓ Loss of high-MW multimers Autosomal dominant 2M Normal or ↑ ↓ ↓↓ ↓ Normal distribution, decreased in quantity Autosomal dominant 2N ↑↑ Normal or ↓ Normal or ↓ ↓↓ Normal distribution Autosomal recessive 3 ↑↑ ↓↓ ↓↓ ↓↓ Absent Autosomal recessive In general, increase in aPTT and BT, but normal PT and platelet count.

      "options": {
        "A": "Hypocalcemia",

        "C": "Hypothermia",
        "D": "Hyperkalemia"
      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer B - Hypokalemia Hypokalemia is not seen with blood transfusions. Instead, hyperkalemia occurs due to leakage of potassium from red blood cells in stored blood. Complications of Massive Blood Transfusion Complication Cause Effect Prevention/ Management Hypothermia (Option C) Transfusion of cold blood (stored at 4°C). Body temperature drops, leading to impaired clotting mechanisms (coagulopathy), and worsening bleeding. Warm blood products before transfusion Use external warming methods (e.g., warming blankets). Coagulopathy Dilution of clotting factors and platelets due to transfusion; consumption of clotting factors by ongoing haemorrhage. Impaired blood clotting, prolonged bleeding time, increased risk of continued bleeding. Administer fresh frozen plasma (FFP), platelets, and cryoprecipitate. For massive BT, blood products should be administered in a 1:1:1 ratio. Monitor clotting factors (e.g., PT, aPTT). Citrate Toxicity Large volumes of transfused blood contain citrate, which binds to calcium. Hypocalcemia (Option A) , leads to muscle cramps, seizures, and cardiac arrhythmias. Administer calcium gluconate or calcium chloride prophylactically. Hyperkalemia (Option D) Potassium leaks from stored red blood cells into plasma during storage. Elevated potassium levels (hyperkalemia) can cause cardiac arrhythmias, potentially leading to cardiac arrest. Monitor potassium levels. Administer calcium to stabilize the myocardium. Insulin with glucose to shift potassium intracellularly if needed. Metabolic Alkalosis Rapid metabolism of citrate into bicarbonate. Increased pH (alkalosis) can lead to muscle twitching, irritability, and impaired oxygen release from haemoglobin. Monitor arterial blood gases (ABG) Adjust transfusion speed and, if necessary, reduce bicarbonate levels. Metabolic Acidosis Inadequate tissue perfusion leads to lactic acid accumulation. Lowered blood pH (acidosis) leads to confusion, fatigue, rapid breathing, and worsened cardiovascular function. Correct underlying cause (e.g., improve perfusion). Administer sodium bicarbonate in severe cases of acidosis. Transfusion Related Acute Lung Injury (TRALI) Antibodies in transfused blood activate the recipient's immune response, causing inflammation and fluid buildup in the lungs. Non-cardiogenic pulmonary oedema, presenting as acute respiratory distress with hypoxia within 6 hours of transfusion. Immediate cessation of transfusion. Oxygen therapy and mechanical ventilation if necessary. Transfusion Associated Circulatory Overload (TACO) The volume of transfused blood exceeds the patient’s capacity to manage, leading to fluid overload. Pulmonary oedema, shortness of breath, hypertension, and signs of heart failure. Administer diuretics (e.g., furosemide). Slow the rate of transfusion. Iron Overload Repeated transfusions lead to excessive accumulation of iron. Iron deposits in organs (e.g., liver, heart, pancreas), lead to organ damage and failure over time. Administer iron chelators (e.g., deferoxamine, deferasirox). Hemolytic Reactions ABO or Rh incompatibility. Rapid destruction of red blood cells (hemolysis), causes fever, chills, hemoglobinuria, and potentially acute renal failure or shock. Immediate cessation of transfusion. Supportive care",

        "B": "Paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria",
        "C": "Hereditary spherocytosis",
        "D": "Hairy cell leukemia"
      },
      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer C- Hereditary spherocytosis Hereditary spherocytosis is an inherited disorder characterized by abnormal red blood cells that are spherical in shape instead of the normal biconcave disc shape. Elective splenectomy is the primary treatment for Hereditary spherocytosis. In HS, splenectomy is particularly effective because the spleen is the primary site of spherocyte destruction. The timing of splenectomy varies with disease severity: severe HS requires elective splenectomy at 4-6 years of age, moderate HS can be delayed until puberty, while mild cases may be managed with folic acid supplementation alone. Management of Hereditary Spherocytosis (HS) Splenectomy as Primary Treatment Splenectomy significantly improves anemia by prolonging red cell survival, reducing the need for transfusions, and preventing iron overload and related organ damage. Post splenectomy: Spherocytosis and altered osmotic fragility persist, but reticulocyte counts and erythrocyte lifespan normalize. Blood Film Changes Post-Splenectomy Features like Howell-Jolly bodies , acanthocytes, target cells, cabot ring and Pappenheimer bodies appear after splenectomy. Indications for Splenectomy Recommended for patients with severe, transfusion-dependent anemia, growth failure, skeletal changes, leg ulcers, or extramedullary hematopoietic tumors. Timing of Splenectomy : Should be delayed until age 5–9 if possible or at least age 3, to reduce the risk of post-splenectomy sepsis while balancing the increased risk of gallstones in older children. Laparoscopic Splenectomy Preferred method, with benefits like less discomfort, quicker recovery, and shorter hospital stays. Combined laparoscopic splenectomy and cholecystectomy is an option for patients with symptomatic gallstones. Partial Splenectomy Used in infants or young children to alleviate anemia while preserving some splenic immune function. It reduces transfusion needs but may eventually require total splenectomy in about half of patients. Pre- and Post-Splenectomy Care Vaccination : Patients should receive vaccines against pneumococcus, Haemophilus influenzae type B, and meningococcus before surgery. Antibiotic Prophylaxis : Use of prophylactic antibiotics post-splenectomy is controversial but recommended by some for at least 5 years or even lifelong. Folic Acid : Continued supplementation (1 mg/day) is recommended to prevent folate deficiency. G6PD deficiency (Option A): In G6PD deficiency, splenectomy may actually worsen the anemia because the spleen filters and removes damaged red blood cells from the circulation. The primary management involves avoiding oxidative stressors and managing acute hemolytic episodes. Paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (Option B): In PNH, there is an abnormality in the complement system, and stem cell transplant is the best curative treatment. Splenectomy is not indicated as the hemolysis is complement-mediated and occurs throughout the circulation. Hairy cell leukemia (Option D): In hairy cell leukemia, chemotherapy is the standard treatment. Splenectomy may be considered only in cases with massively enlarged spleen or if there is resistance to other treatments, but it is not the preferred initial treatment option.",

      },
      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "multiple blood transfusions, iron overload, and cardiac arrhythmia, the presenting symptoms of backache and anxiety during a blood transfusion raise concerns for a transfusion reaction, specifically an acute hemolytic transfusion reaction. In this scenario, the appropriate course of action is to stop the blood transfusion immediately to prevent further complications. Once the transfusion is stopped, the patient should be closely monitored for any signs of worsening symptoms, and supportive measures should be initiated as necessary. Incorrect options: Option B - Continue the transfusion but do an ECG: Continuing the transfusion without addressing the potential transfusion reaction can lead to further complications and risks the patient's safety. Option C - Stop the transfusion, wait for the patient to become normal, and then start it again: This approach is not recommended because a suspected transfusion reaction requires prompt action. Stopping the transfusion is the first step to prevent the reaction from worsening and to ensure the patient's safety. Option D - Do clerical check and get ECG: While a clerical check and ECG may be relevant in certain situations, such as ensuring the correct blood product is being transfused or assessing for potential cardiac complications.

      "explanation": "Correct Answer: B) Blood transfusion Explanation: The most appropriate course of action for managing a patient presenting with fatigue, a hemoglobin level below 9 g/dL, and sickle-shaped red blood cells on peripheral smear examination is blood transfusion . In patients with sickle cell disease (SCD), a hemoglobin (Hb) level below 9 g/dL accompanied by symptoms such as fatigue indicates significant anemia. Blood transfusion is the primary treatment to increase the oxygen-carrying capacity of the blood, alleviate symptoms, and prevent complications associated with severe anemia. According to the 2014 evidence-based report by expert panel members, transfusion therapy is recommended in SCD patients with symptomatic anemia to improve oxygen delivery and reduce the risk of stroke and other complications. Administer IV antibiotics (Option A): While antibiotics are essential in managing infections in SCD patients, they do not address anemia directly. Administer desferoxamine (Option C): Desferoxamine is an iron-chelating agent used to treat iron overload from chronic transfusions. It is not suitable for acute management of anemia. Wait and watch (Option D): Delaying treatment in symptomatic anemia can lead to worsening hypoxia and increased risk of complications.",
