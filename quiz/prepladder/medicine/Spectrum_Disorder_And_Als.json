        "D": "Decreased visual acuity"
      },
      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: C) Unilateral involvement of the optic nerve Explanation: NMO characteristically presents with bilateral optic neuritis , meaning both optic nerves are affected. Unilateral optic neuritis is more common in multiple sclerosis. Clinical Features of Neuromyelitis Optica Spectrum Disorder (NMO) NMO, formerly Devic’s disease , involves: Transverse myelitis : Inflammatory spinal cord lesion. Bilateral optic neuritis : Inflammation in both optic nerves. Aquaporin-4 antibodies are often detected in most cases. Brain MRI may show lesions near the periventricular region. Spinal MRI reveals lesions extending across ≥ 3 spinal segments (longer than MS lesions). Clinical recovery in NMO tends to be worse compared to MS. NMO shows a more aggressive course with frequent relapses. Treatment includes glucocorticoids, azathioprine, cyclophosphamide, or plasmapheresis for better outcomes than MS. Features of Transverse Myelitis in NMO Domain Symptoms Sensory Numbness, tingling, or cold sensations in limbs Often progresses proximally (up to the trunk) Motor Weakness, stiffness, or heaviness in limbs (mostly legs) Sphincters Urgency or difficulty in urination This can lead to urinary retention Features of Bilateral Optic Neuritis in NMO Symptom Description Vision Loss Partial or complete loss in one or both eyes Visual Acuity Decrease Blurry or reduced sharpness of vision (Option D ruled out) Reduced Color Perception Diminished ability to see colours accurately Optic Atrophy Pale optic disc due to nerve fibre loss Afferent Pupillary Defect Delayed pupil response in the affected eye Pain with Eye Movement Eye pain, especially with central vision loss (Option A ruled out) Scotoma Central or paracentral blind spots in vision (Option B ruled out) Reference: Davidson’s Principles and Practice of Medicine, 24th Edition, Page: 1089, 1108, 1110, 1136, 1138.",

      "question": "A 45-year-old man presents with asymmetric muscle weakness in the arms and legs. Nerve conduction studies reveal focal demyelination with conduction block. Which of the following conditions is most likely indicated by these findings?",
      "options": {
        "A": "Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS)",
        "B": "Multifocal Motor Neuropathy with Conduction Block (MMN)",
        "C": "Diabetic Polyneuropathy",
        "D": "Charcot-Marie-Tooth Disease"
      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: B) Multifocal Motor Neuropathy with Conduction Block (MMN) Explanation: Multifocal Motor Neuropathy with Conduction Block (MMN) is confirmed through nerve conduction studies that reveal focal demyelination and conduction blocks, differentiating it from conditions like Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS), which typically show normal conduction studies. MMN commonly presents with asymmetric muscle weakness, particularly affecting the arms. Multifocal Neuropathy with Conduction Block: Definition: Multifocal neuropathy, also known as mononeuritis multiplex, involves damage to multiple nerve roots, peripheral nerves, or cranial nerves. Characteristics: Pattern of Involvement: Affects multiple individual nerves rather than a symmetrical distribution. Multifocal Motor Neuropathy with Conduction Block (MMN): Specific subtypes affecting motor nerves are identifiable via nerve conduction studies. Typically, it affects arms more than legs. About 50% of cases are associated with antibodies against ganglioside GM1. Usually responds to intravenous immunoglobulin treatment. Distinguishing MMN from ALS: Criteria MMN ALS Nerve Conduction Studies Shows focal demyelination with/without conduction block Normal sensory and motor conduction studies; may show reduced motor action potential amplitude Symptoms Weakness in specific muscles; asymmetrical Progressive muscle weakness; can be symmetrical or asymmetrical Causes of Multifocal Neuropathy: Type Potential Causes Axonal Multifocal Neuropathy Vasculitis (systemic or non-systemic) Diabetes mellitus Sarcoidosis Infections (HIV, hepatitis C, Lyme disease, leprosy, diphtheria) Demyelinating Multifocal Neuropathy Multifocal motor neuropathy Multiple compression neuropathies Multifocal acquired demyelinating sensory and motor neuropathy (MADSAM) Hereditary neuropathy with a predisposition to pressure palsy Lymphoma Key Points: MMN can mimic ALS but is distinguishable through nerve conduction studies. Treatment options are available, notably intravenous immunoglobulin. Various underlying conditions can lead to multifocal neuropathy, either axonal or demyelinating in nature. Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS) (Option A): Typically shows normal sensory and motor nerve conduction studies, so this option is incorrect. Diabetic Polyneuropathy (Option C): Generally presents with a symmetrical pattern of involvement and does not typically show conduction blocks. Charcot-Marie-Tooth Disease (Option D): A hereditary neuropathy that primarily presents with a different pattern of symptoms and nerve conduction abnormalities, usually not associated with acute conduction blocks.

      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: A) Muscle weakness in distal limbs Explanation: SMA primarily affects proximal muscles more than distal ones. Spinal Muscular Atrophy (SMA): Genetic Basis: Common Cause: Caused by mutations in the SMN1 gene , leading to insufficient survival motor neuron (SMN) protein , essential for motor neuron health. Other Forms: Different genes may be involved in other SMA forms. Symptoms: Muscle Weakness: Primarily affects trunk and proximal limbs more than distal muscles. Additional Issues: Respiratory infections (Option D ruled out) Scoliosis (Option B ruled out) Joint contractures (Option C ruled out) Diagnosis: Method Description Clinical Evaluation Thorough medical history, physical examination, and neurological assessment. Genetic Testing Blood tests identify mutations in the SMN1 gene, detecting ~95% of SMA cases. Electromyography (EMG) Assesses muscle and nerve function. Nerve Conduction Studies Evaluates the electrical activity of muscles and nerves. Treatment: Treatment Description Supportive Care Aims to optimise quality of life; includes: Physical therapy Nutritional support Respiratory care FDA-Approved Treatments Nusinersen (Spinraza): Increases SMN protein production by modifying splicing of the SMN2 gene. Significant improvements in motor function for SMA types I, II, and III. Other emerging therapies are under investigation. Onasemnogene Abeparvovec ( Zolgensma): It is a gene therapy that delivers a functional copy of the SMN1 gene to motor neurons, enabling the production of the SMN protein. It is approved for children under 2 years with SMA. This treatment has been shown to enhance muscle movement, function, and overall survival. Risdiplam (Evrysdi) It is an oral medication that increases the production of SMN protein in the body. It is approved for the treatment of SMA in adults and children aged 2 months and older . Research Initiatives: The NIH focuses on: Identifying genetic mutations contributing to SMA. Exploring cellular processes for potential therapeutic targets. Developing biomarkers for better disease monitoring and treatment efficacy.

      },
      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: C) Percutaneous Gastrostomy (PEG) Explanation: Percutaneous Gastrostomy (PEG) enhances the quality of life related to feeding and can potentially extend survival, especially in advanced stages. Treatment of Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS): No cure for ALS: Management focuses on symptom relief and supportive care. Treatment: Treatment Description Riluzole (Option A ruled out) Glutamate release antagonist. Prolongs median survival by 2–3 months. Non-Invasive Ventilation (NIV) Significantly prolongs survival and improves quality of life. Best for those with better baseline bulbar function. Percutaneous Gastrostomy (PEG) Enhances quality of life and may extend survival. Effective even in later disease stages. Multidisciplinary Care Involves a team of specialists: Physiotherapists, speech and occupational therapists, dietitians, neurologists, respiratory specialists, and palliative care teams. Importance of Early Access to Palliative Care: Rapid access to palliative care is crucial as patients transition into terminal phases of MND.

      "explanation": "Correct Answer: B) T lymphocytes Explanation: T lymphocytes, particularly autoreactive CD4+ T cells, are crucial in the pathogenesis of multiple sclerosis. They are responsible for crossing the blood-brain barrier and initiating an immune response against myelin, leading to demyelination and the formation of lesions in the CNS. Multiple sclerosis Multiple sclerosis (MS) is an autoimmune disease of the central nervous system characterized by chronic inflammation, demyelination, gliosis (plaques or scarring), and neuronal loss. The course can be relapsing or progressive. MS plaques typically develop at different times and in different CNS locations. Aetiology: Both genetic and environmental factors are contributing Environmental factors: sunlight exposure, vitamin D deficiency (controversial), and Epstein–Barr virus (EBV) exposure, though mechanisms are unclear Genetic factors: 15% familial occurrence risk, highest in first-degree relatives; 30% concordance in monozygotic twins Pathophysiology: Immune hypothesis: increased T lymphocytes in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and higher immunoglobulin synthesis in the CNS Blood-brain barrier (BBB) injury: Activated T lymphocytes cross the blood-brain barrier, recognize myelin antigens on nervous system antigen-presenting cells (microglia) (Option C ruled out) and proliferate (Option B) Demyelination: Inflammatory cascade releases cytokines, leading to oligodendrocyte –myelin destruction by macrophages Lesions: Disintegration of myelin, lymphocyte/macrophage infiltration, and perivascular inflammation Ectopic lymphoid follicles are linked to demyelination and neuronal loss in the cerebral cortex Diffusible factors from these lymphoid cells may cause demyelination and neurodegeneration Axonal damage: Demyelination reduces trophic support for axons, redistributes ion channels, and destabilizes action potential membrane potentials Neuronal and axonal death may result from glutamate excitotoxicity, oxidative injury, iron accumulation, and mitochondrial failure Inflammatory mediators like nitric oxide initiate and worsen axonal damage Axons can adapt initially to these injuries, but over time, distal and retrograde degeneration (“dying-back” axonopathy) occurs Axonal loss accumulates over time due to repeated attacks and lack of neurotrophic factors from oligodendrocytes Plaque formation: After acute attacks, gliosis occurs by astrocyte cells, forming scars (Option D ruled out) Surviving oligodendrocytes partially remyelinate axons causing shadow plaques (Option A ruled out) Oligodendrocyte precursor cells often fail to differentiate into myelin-producing cells Long-term myelin loss leads to reduced impulse propagation and conduction block, impairing CNS functions",

      "explanation": "Correct Answer: D) Vertical gaze and convergence are typically impaired in this syndrome. Combination of ipsilateral conjugate horizontal gaze palsy (the \"one\") and ipsilateral internuclear ophthalmoplegia (INO) (the \"half\") Physiology: Visual signals from frontal and parietal lobes activate the Paramedian Pontine Reticular Formation (PPRF) PPRF excites the ipsilateral abducens nucleus Abducens nucleus sends: Motor fibres to the ipsilateral lateral rectus muscle Signals to the contralateral MLF activate the medial rectus of the opposite eye via the oculomotor nucleus Pathophysiology: Possible lesion sites responsible for the horizontal gaze palsy in One and a Half Syndrome include: Damage to both the ipsilateral abducens nucleus and the PPRF. Damage confined to the ipsilateral abducens nucleus. Damage isolated to the ipsilateral PPRF. Damage to the ipsilateral abducens nerve root along with the contralateral MLF, potentially due to two separate lesions. Clinical Presentation: Ipsilateral horizontal gaze palsy.

        "D": "Lesion in the right sixth cranial nerve"
      },
      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: C) Lesion in the left medial longitudinal fasciculus Explanation: Based on the history of multiple sclerosis and clinical manifestation the most probable diagnosis is internuclear ophthalmoplegia. In this case, the lesion in the left medial longitudinal fasciculus interrupts communication between the left third cranial nerve nucleus (responsible for adducting the left eye) and the right sixth cranial nerve nucleus (responsible for abducting the right eye). This results in slowed adduction of the left eye when attempting to look to the right and horizontal nystagmus in the right eye as it abducts. Internuclear Ophthalmoplegia It is an ocular movement disorder caused by a lesion of the medial longitudinal fasciculus. Aetiology: Multiple sclerosis Others Trauma Tentorial herniation Infections (like HIV, syphilis, cysticercosis, herpes zoster, tuberculoma) Tumors (medulloblastoma, glioma, lymphoma, metastases) Vasculitis (systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), Sjogren syndrome) Iatrogenic injury Brainstem haemorrhage Physiology: When a person looks on the left side, the lateral rectus muscle supplied by the 6th nerve and the medial rectus muscle supplied by the 3rd nerve gets in sync with each other so that eyes can fixate on a particular object. Cross-communication occurs with the help of the medial longitudinal fasciculus. Pathophysiology: Lesion in the medial longitudinal fasciculus (MLF), blocks the communication between the contralateral sixth nerve nucleus and ipsilateral third nerve nucleus, affecting horizontal gaze (Option C) Clinical features: Slowing or impaired adduction in the ipsilateral eye to the MLF lesion Horizontal nystagmus in the abducting eye (contralateral eye) as a compensatory response Lesion in the right lateral rectus muscle (Option A): It leads to weakness in the abduction of the right eye. However, this does not cause slowed adduction of the left eye or the horizontal nystagmus observed in the right eye. Therefore, this option is incorrect. Lesion in the left sixth cranial nerve (Option B): It leads to the inability to abduct the left eye, resulting in double vision when looking to the left. In this scenario, the patient has slowed adduction in the left eye and double vision when looking to the right. Therefore, this option is incorrect. Lesion in the right sixth cranial nerve (Option D): It leads to the inability to abduct the right eye, resulting in double vision when looking to the right. In this scenario, the patient has slowed adduction in the left eye. Therefore, this option is incorrect.",

      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: B) Uthoff’s symptoms Explanation: Uthoff's symptom refers to the temporary worsening of neurological symptoms due to increased body temperature, often triggered by heat exposure, such as spending time in a sauna. This symptom is common in patients with multiple sclerosis. Multiple sclerosis (MS) Clinical features: Abrupt or insidious onset of symptoms Sensory symptoms Paresthesias: tingling, prickling sensations, “pins and needles,” or painful burning. Hypesthesia: reduced sensation, numbness, or a “dead” feeling. Unpleasant sensations: feelings that body parts are swollen, wet, raw, or tightly wrapped. Pain is a common symptom of MS. Optic neuritis (ON) (Option C ruled out) Diminished visual acuity. Decreased colour perception in the central field of vision. May progress to severe visual loss. Periorbital pain. Fundoscopic examination: normal or optic disc swelling (papillitis), pallor of the optic disc (optic atrophy). Weakness of the limbs Loss of strength, speed, dexterity, and gait disturbance. Exercise-induced weakness is a characteristic symptom of MS. Upper motor neuron type weakness accompanied by other pyramidal signs. Facial weakness Lesion in the pons may resemble idiopathic Bell’s palsy. Spasticity Spontaneous and movement-induced muscle spasms. Painful spasms. Visual blurring Due to ON (optic neuritis) or diplopia. Diplopia is caused by internuclear ophthalmoplegia (INO) or palsy of the sixth cranial nerve. (Option D ruled out) Bilateral INO is particularly suggestive of MS. Other gaze disturbances in MS: Horizontal gaze palsy One-and-a-half syndrome (horizontal gaze palsy plus an INO) Acquired pendular nystagmus Ataxia Cerebellar tremors. Cerebellar dysarthria. Vertigo Lesion in the brainstem. Ancillary symptoms Paroxysmal symptoms Brief duration (10s to 2 min), high frequency (5–40 episodes per day), no change of consciousness or change in background electroencephalogram during episodes, and a self-limited course. Lhermitte’s symptom (Option A ruled out) An electric shock-like sensation that radiates down the back into the legs. Typically induced by flexion or other movements of the neck. Trigeminal neuralgia, hemifacial spasm, and glossopharyngeal neuralgia Demyelinating lesions involve the root entry or exit zone of the fifth, seventh, and ninth cranial nerve, respectively. Facial myokymia Persistent rapid flickering contractions of the facial musculature Slow spread of contraction across the face. Heat sensitivity Uthoff symptoms: Neurological symptoms develop from heat exposure, such as steam baths and saunas. (Option B) Bladder dysfunction Present in >90% of MS patients. Detrusor hyperreflexia. Detrusor sphincter dyssynergia - hesitancy, urinary retention, overflow incontinence, and recurrent infection. Bowel dysfunction Constipation, faecal urgency or bowel incontinence. Cognitive dysfunction Memory loss. Impaired attention. Psychiatric symptom Depression. Fatigue 90% of patients experience fatigue. It causes work-related disability. Reference: Harrison’s Principle of Internal Medicine, 21st Edition, Page: 3462, 3463.",
