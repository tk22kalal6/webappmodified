      "explanation": "Correct Answer: D) All of the above Explanation: A young child presenting with pallor, easy fatigability, increased frequency of bleeding, and presence of Philadelphia chromosome is suggestive of Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia(ALL). Acute lymphoblastic leukemia is an acute-onset blood and bone marrow malignancy of B and T lymphoblasts characterized by the uncontrolled proliferation of abnormal and immature lymphocytes. B-cell type is the most common subtype of ALL. ALL is M/C hematological malignancy seen in pediatric age groups. Aetiology A - Ataxia Telangiectasia (Neurocutaneous disorder). B - Bloom syndrome, Benzene exposure. C - Chemotherapy. Nitrosoureas and epipodophyllotoxins D - Down syndrome. I - Ionising radiation /Infection: HTLV-1 F - Fanconi's anemia K - Klinefelter syndrome. N - NF-1. P - Philadelphia chromosome Translocations: t(4:11), t(1:19), t(8:14)- Seen in both Burkitt's lymphoma and ALL. Reference: Harrison's Textbook for Internal Medicine, 21st edition, Page 828, 829.",

      "question": "For the past few weeks, a 6-year-old has been experiencing fatigue, pallor, and recurrent infections. Her parents also report that she has been experiencing night sweats and loss of appetite. On examination, she appears pale and has multiple petechiae on her skin. A complete blood count reveals a hemoglobin level of 8 g/dL, a white blood cell count of 150,000/µL, and a platelet count of 30,000/µL. Physical examination reveals hepatosplenomegaly. The peripheral smear is given below. What is the most likely diagnosis?",

Weight loss, Night sweats Anemia : Easy fatigability and pallor Bleeding : Epistaxis, easy bruising. Leucocytopenia : Recurrent infections Bone Marrow proliferation : Bone pain, sternal tenderness Hepatosplenomegaly, Lymphadenopathy CNS leukemia : Raised ICP, vomiting, and 6th nerve palsy T cell tumors : Mediastinal and testicular mass. Work up of ALL: CBC (Option A) is the first investigation performed while suspecting ALL: Hemoglobin (Hb) : Decreased, indicating normocytic normochromic anemia. Hyperleukocytosis : TLC >100,000/µL can lead to leukostasis (more common in AML than ALL) with >20% Blasts. Elderly Presentation : TLC often remains low throughout ALL. Thrombocytopenia may be present. Peripheral smear: The smear shows a high percentage of lymphoblasts , which are larger than normal lymphocytes and have a high",

      },
      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "cytarabine, vincristine, and anthracyclines. Correct Answer: C) Consolidation therapy for high-risk T-cell ALL includes cyclophosphamide, cytarabine, vincristine, and anthracyclines. Explanation : The management of acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) includes three phases: Induction Therapy : Aims for complete remission or even complete remission with Minimal residual disease (MRD) not detectable and restoring normal hematopoiesis. Common regimens include vincristine, glucocorticoids (dexamethasone/prednisolone), L-asparaginase, and daunorubicin . (Option A) Patients with minimal residual disease at the end of induction may receive immunotherapy (e.g., blinatumomab, dasatinib ). (Option D) NOTE: Complete Remission- Leukemic cells not detectable by light microscopy.(Blasts<5% in bone marrow) Minimal residual disease- Detectable residual leukemic cells via flow cytometry, PCR etc but not detectable via light microscopy. Complete molecular remission- Patient in complete remission along with no Minimal residual disease. Consolidation Therapy : Focuses on deepening remission and CNS treatment. (Option B) Low-risk : Intrathecal methotrexate therapy, vincristine, and 6-Mercaptopurine. Standard/Intermediate risk : Includes glucocorticoids, cyclophosphamide, cytarabine, vincristine, asparaginase, 6-MP, and methotrexate. High-risk/T-cell ALL : Cyclophosphamide, cytarabine, vincristine, asparaginase, 6-MP, high-dose methotrexate, additional glucocorticoids, and anthracyclines. Maintenance Therapy : Lasts 2-3 years and includes vincristine, 6-MP, prednisolone, and methotrexate. In Ph-positive ALL , maintenance therapy includes BCR/ABL Tyrosine kinase inhibitors like Imatinib, Dasatinib, Nilotinib, etc are used. Stem cell transplant may be considered in first complete remission based on risk assessment or minimal residual disease. Immunotherapeutic approach for B cell lineage showing poor response to less intensive chemotherapy- Anti CD20- rituximab Anti CD22- inotuzumab ozogamicin Anti CD19- blinatumomab Chimeric antigen receptor(CAR) T cells can be used in CD19+ cases. ALL patients are prone to viral infections and pneumocystis pneumonia during their treatment. Antibiotics, such as acyclovir, and cotrimoxazole are given during ALL therapy to help prevent these infections. Reinduction is done in case of absence of remission after completion of induction therapy. Reference: Harrison’s Principles of Internal Medicine, 21st Edition, Page 831.",

      "options": {
        "A": "Intrathecal methotrexate",

        "D": "Vincristine"
      },
      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: A) Intrathecal methotrexate Explanation: The aforementioned scenario indicates the occurrence of CNS leukemia. CNS ALL is much easier to prevent than treat. Intrathecal methotrexate is a procedure involving the administration of methotrexate directly into the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) within the spinal canal. This method is employed to treat or prevent the spread of cancer cells to the central nervous system (CNS) in ALL cases. Performing a lumbar puncture for CSF cytology carries a risk of Iatrogenic CNS leukemia due to potential bleeding from ruptured epidural vessels, which can introduce blood cells into the CSF. To mitigate this risk, intrathecal methotrexate is often administered during the same session. Systemic high-dose chemotherapy and cranial radiation therapy are other modalities used to manage CNS involvement in patients with high-risk ALL. Intrathecal methotrexate, cytarabine, and dexamethasone combination therapy along with cranial irradiation (24 Gy), can also be used. Nilotinib (Option B): Inhibits the activity of tyrosine kinases, including BCR-ABL, which is characteristic of CML and some forms of ALL. Though TKIs are used in Ph-positive ALL Nilotinib does not cross the blood-brain barrier. Blinatumomab (Option C): This is used for the treatment of Philadelphia chromosome-positive high-risk ALL. Vincristine (Option D): It is part of a treatment regimen for low-risk ALL not really used in prophylaxis of CNS ALL. Reference: Harrison's Textbook for Internal Medicine, 21st Edition, Page 829.",

      },
      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Correct answer: C) ALL-L3 (Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia, Burkitt-type). Explanation: FAB Classification: The French-American-British (FAB) classification divides acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) into three categories based on the morphology of the leukemic cells: ALL-L1: Characterized by small, uniform lymphoblasts with scant cytoplasm. ALL-L2: Involves larger, more pleomorphic lymphoblasts. ALL-L3: Associated with Burkitt-type morphology, which features larger cells with abundant cytoplasm and a prominent nucleolus. Clinical Presentation: Fatigue, pallor, recurrent infections, bone pain, and hepatosplenomegaly, are typical of leukemia due to bone marrow infiltration. The presence of leukocytosis with a predominance of lymphoblasts, low hemoglobin, and thrombocytopenia supports the diagnosis of acute leukemia. Bone Marrow Biopsy: The finding of more than 20% lymphoblasts in the bone marrow confirms an acute leukemic process. Cytogenetic Analysis: Identifying the Philadelphia chromosome typically indicates a poor prognosis and is more commonly associated with ALL-L3 (Burkitt-type) leukemia.

      "explanation": "Correct Answer: C) Blinatumomab Explanation: The given clinical scenario indicates that the girl is suffering from Acute Lymphoblastic leukemia. In case of relapse post-chemotherapy newer drugs like Immunotherapy agents or activated T cells can be used. B-lineage blast cells express a variety of specific antigens, and monoclonal antibodies against those antigens are used in treating ALL. However, these immunotherapeutic agents are not used in initial therapy for children due to side effects on the CNS, growth, cytokine storm, fever, hypertension etc. Anti CD20 B- Precursor Burkitt Leukemia/Lymphoma Rituximab Ofatumomab Anti CD22 B- Precursor Mature B-ALL Inotuzumab Epratuzumab Moxetumomab Pasudotox Anti CD19 B- Precursor Mature B-ALL Blinatumomab CAR-T cells Note: Blinatumomab is a bi-specific antibody , that combines single-chain antibodies to CD19 and CD3 such that T-cells are brought into proximity with and lyse with the CD19-bearing B-cells.
