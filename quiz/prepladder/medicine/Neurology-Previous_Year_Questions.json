      "question": "A patient presented with a blood pressure of 220/120 mmHg in an altered sensorium. He also had an episode of vomiting and a history of weakness on the left side of his body. Which of the following is incorrect regarding hypertensive management in this case? rebleed",
      "options": {
        "A": "In hemorrhagic stroke, reduce the BP to less than 160/100 mmHg with antihypertensives to prevent",

        "C": "In the ER, multiple blood pressure readings should be taken before starting antihypertensive therapy",
        "D": "In ischemic stroke, BP should be reduced to <140/90 mmHg immediately"
      },
      "correct_answer": "D",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: D) In ischemic stroke, BP should be reduced to <140/90 mmHg immediately management includes reducing the BP to <185/110 mmHg before administering thrombolytic therapy. Lowering BP too aggressively could compromise cerebral perfusion, potentially worsening the ischemia and increasing infarct size. Hemorrhagic Stroke: BP should be lowered to <160/100 mmHg with antihypertensives to reduce the risk of rebleeding (Option A). If SBP > 220 mmHg, aggressive use of IV antihypertensives is recommended (Option B). Ischemic Stroke: BP should only be reduced to <185/110 mmHg before thrombolysis. If the BP is above this threshold and thrombolysis is considered, lowering it is necessary, but a reduction to <140/90 mmHg can worsen cerebral perfusion. Emergency Management: In a hypertensive emergency, multiple BP readings should be taken to ensure accurate assessment before starting antihypertensive therapy (Option C). This is important to avoid over- or under-treatment. Reference: Harrison's Principles of Internal Medicine, 21st Edition, Pages 2086, 2087.",

      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: B) Plasmapheresis is not preferred in refractory cases Explanation: Plasmapheresis is actually preferred in refractory cases of Guillain-Barré Syndrome (GBS), especially when the condition does not improve after initial treatment with intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG). The standard treatment for GBS involves the use of either IVIG or plasmapheresis, depending on the patient's condition and response to initial therapy. Guillain-Barré Syndrome (GBS) Guillain-Barré Syndrome (GBS) is a n acute autoimmune disorder that affects the peripheral nervous system . It often leads to ascending paralysis , starting from the lower limbs and spreading upwards. GBS is considered a neurological emergency due to its potential to cause respiratory failure, autonomic dysfunction, and death without timely treatment. Incidence: GBS occurs in 1–2 cases per 100,000 individuals annually. Preceding Infections: In about two-thirds of AIDP cases , a preceding infection triggers an autoimmune response. Common infections include: Campylobacter jejuni Cytomegalovirus (CMV) Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) Zika virus Influenza These infections lead to molecular mimicry , where the immune system attacks nerve structures , particularly the myelin sheath , causing demyelination. Variants of Guillain-Barré Syndrome: Variant Description Autoantibodies Acute Inflammatory Demyelinating Polyneuropathy (AIDP) Most common in Europe and North America, marked by segmental demyelination . IgG Anti-GM1 , IgG Anti-GQ1b Axonal Variants (AMAN/AMSAN) More prevalent in China and Japan, often linked with Campylobacter jejuni infection. IgG Anti-GM1 Miller Fisher Syndrome Characterized by a triad of ophthalmoplegia, ataxia, and areflexia , the best-recognized variant. Anti-GQ1b Autoantibodies in Guillain-Barré Syndrome: Diversity: GBS patients exhibit a range of autoantibodies targeting nerve cells and structures. Common Antibodies: The most common are anti-ganglioside antibodies , which appear in up to 50% of GBS cases . Prognostic Implications: The presence of anti-GM1 antibodies correlates with poorer clinical outcomes , especially in pure motor variants and Miller Fisher Syndrome . Clinical Features: Motor Symptoms Progressive ascending paralysis (distal to proximal) Areflexia Weakness in legs, causing rubbery legs and instability to stand Truncal paralysis, quadriplegia Difficulty handling secretions leading to aspiration pneumonia Diaphragmatic paralysis or bulbar palsy leading to respiratory failure within hours, Ventilatory support required in 30% of cases Sensory Symptoms Glove-and-stocking distribution paresthesias Loss of proprioception Pain in neck/shoulders similar to over-exercised muscles Autonomic Symptoms Orthostatic hypotension Wide fluctuations of blood pressure Arrhythmias Neurogenic shock Diagnostic Findings: Category Findings Lumbar Puncture Elevated CSF protein (100-1000 mg/dL) with normal WBC count (albuminocytologic dissociation) CSF Timing Normal findings (<48 hours), protein rise seen by 7 days Electrodiagnostic Testing Prolonged F-wave latencies, indicating demyelination (early in AIDP) Brighton Criteria for Diagnosis of GBS: Mnemonic: FAME F laccid Bilateral Weakness Areflexia (Option A) CytoAlbuminologic dissociation (Elevated CSF protein, normal WBC) (Option D) M onophasic Illness (Symptoms develop over 12 hours to 28 days) E lectrodiagnostic findings consistent with demyelination Treatment: IVIG (Intravenous Immunoglobulin) (Option C): First-line treatment.

      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: B) Anti-MuSK antibodies Explanation: MuSK is essential for clustering AChRs at the neuromuscular junction. Anti-MuSK antibodies are found in AChR-negative patients, often presenting with bulbar muscle weakness (affecting speech and swallowing). Autoantibodies in Myasthenia Gravis Myasthenia gravis is an autoimmune disorder characterized by muscle weakness due to disrupted neuromuscular transmission. Types of Autoantibodies Autoantibody Target Effects Associated Features AChR antibodies Acetylcholine receptors (AChR) on the postsynaptic membrane Blocks signal transmission, leading to muscle weakness Most common MuSK antibodies Muscle-specific kinase (MuSK) Impairs AChR clustering and maintenance Found in AChR-negative patients; associated with bulbar muscle weakness (speech, swallowing, chewing issues) Diagnostic Tests Repetitive Nerve Stimulation : Shows a decremental response (decline in muscle activity with repeated stimulation), indicating faulty neuromuscular transmission. Blood Tests : Detect the presence of AChR and MuSK antibodies . Anti-dsDNA antibodies (Option A) : Seen in systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) , not associated with neuromuscular transmission issues. Anti-TPO antibodies (Option C) : Linked with autoimmune thyroid disorders (e.g., Hashimoto’s thyroiditis).

        "D": "Wallenberg syndrome"
      },
      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "pontine syndrome, is characterized by a combination of ipsilateral cranial nerve (CN) VI and VII palsy with contralateral hemiplegia. The clinical presentation in this case—left-sided arm and leg weakness (contralateral hemiplegia), right-sided facial paralysis (ipsilateral CN VII palsy), and difficulty with horizontal eye movements (ipsilateral CN VI palsy)—is consistent with Millard-Gubler syndrome. This syndrome occurs due to a lesion in the ventral pons, affecting the corticospinal tract (which causes contralateral hemiplegia) and the fascicles of the abducens (CN VI) and facial (CN VII) nerves, leading to ipsilateral facial paralysis and difficulty in horizontal eye movements. Incorrect Options: Option A - Foville syndrome: This syndrome also involves a lesion in the pons, but it typically affects the paramedian region, leading to ipsilateral facial paralysis, horizontal gaze palsy, and contralateral hemiplegia. However, Foville syndrome often includes additional symptoms like loss of conjugate gaze due to involvement of the pontine tegmentum. Option B - Benedict's syndrome: This syndrome is caused by a lesion in the midbrain, involving the red nucleus and the third nerve fascicles. It leads to ipsilateral oculomotor nerve palsy (ptosis, dilated pupil, and loss of most eye movements) and contralateral ataxia and tremor. It does not match the symptomatology of the case described. Option D - Wallenberg syndrome: Also known as lateral medullary syndrome, this condition is due to a lesion in the lateral part of the medulla oblongata. It results in ipsilateral facial pain and temperature sensation loss, contralateral loss of pain and temperature sensation on the body, dysphagia, hoarseness, and vertigo. It does not involve cranial nerves VI and VII or cause contralateral hemiplegia.",

      "explanation": "characterized by the development of various tumors, including brain tumors (often hemangioblastomas), kidney tumors (renal cell carcinoma), and other tumors like pheochromocytomas. The family history of both brain and kidney tumors aligns with VHL syndrome. This condition is due to mutations in the VHL gene. Incorrect Options: Option A - Neurofibromatosis: Neurofibromatosis (NF) has two main types: NF1 and NF2. NF1 is associated with cutaneous neurofibromas, café-au-lait spots, and optic nerve tumors, while NF2 is associated with bilateral vestibular schwannomas (acoustic neuromas) and other central nervous system tumors. Although brain tumors are present, NF does not typically present with kidney tumors. Option B - Li-Fraumeni syndrome: Li-Fraumeni syndrome is a hereditary condition associated with a higher risk of several cancers, including breast cancer, sarcomas, brain tumors, and adrenal cortex tumors. While it is associated with brain tumors, it is not typically associated with kidney tumors. The syndrome is caused by mutations in the TP53 gene. Option D - Churg-Strauss syndrome: Churg-Strauss syndrome, now known as eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis (EGPA), is an autoimmune condition that affects small and medium-sized blood vessels. It primarily involves respiratory symptoms, asthma, and vasculitis, but it is not associated with brain and kidney tumors.",

This technique can help differentiate between various types of lesions based on their biochemical signatures, making it valuable in distinguishing between tuberculomas (due to Mycobacterium tuberculosis) and neurocysticercosis (due to Taenia solium). NMR Spectroscopy analyzes the metabolic byproducts and chemical composition of the lesions, which can help in differentiating between conditions like tuberculoma and neurocysticercosis. It can provide information about the presence of specific metabolites and biochemical changes associated with each condition. Incorrect Options: Option A - CBNAAT of CSF: While CBNAAT is excellent for detecting Mycobacterium tuberculosis DNA and is very useful in diagnosing CNS tuberculosis, it is not typically used to distinguish between tuberculoma and neurocysticercosis directly. It confirms the presence of tuberculosis but does not provide biochemical information about the lesion itself. Option B - PET Scan: PET scans show metabolic activity in tissues and can be helpful in assessing lesions, but they do not provide detailed biochemical or chemical information specific to tuberculoma vs. neurocysticercosis.

      "explanation": "Correct Answer: B) Hypercarbia Explanation: The typical hand movements shown in the image are known as asterixis or \"flapping tremors. These characteristic hand movements are seen in patients of toxic-metabolic encephalopathy, potentially due to hypercarbia. The 3 causes of toxic-metabolic encephalopathy include: Hepatic encephalopathy (Increased level of ammonia) Uremic encephalopathy (Increased level of urea) Hypercarbia (Increased level of CO2) This condition occurs frequently in patients with chronic CO2 retention , particularly those receiving oxygen therapy for emphysema or chronic pulmonary disease. The flapping movement is elicited by having patients extend their arms and bend their wrists back. Thyrotoxicosis (Option A) presents with fine tremors. The tremor pattern is distinctly different from the coarse flapping movements seen in asterixis. Hemiballismus (Option C) manifests with wild, flinging movements at the shoulder joint. These movements are abrupt and unilateral compared to the bilateral wrist movements seen in asterixis. Hypoxia (Option D) typically causes disorientation and mental status changes with O2 saturation <90%.

Clinical Features of Myasthenia Gravis: Fatigable muscle weakness : Muscle strength decreases with continued use , especially: Later in the day as day progresses After exercise No sensory or CNS involvement , distinguishing it from other neurological disorders. Common Initial Symptoms Ptosis (drooping eyelid) Diplopia (double vision) Weakness can spread to: Chewing, swallowing, and speaking muscles Limb muscles Muscle Weakness Patterns: Affected Muscles Key Features Ocular muscles Mimics central eye movement disorders. Cogan's lid twitch sign Upper eyelid rises briefly after looking down for some time. Shoulder girdle muscles Difficulty in overhead activities like combing hair. Respiratory muscles Weakness may cause respiratory failure and aspiration risks. Fibromyalgia (Option B): This chronic condition is characterized by widespread musculoskeletal pain, fatigue, and tender points rather than true muscle weakness. It does not present with ptosis or demonstrate diurnal variation in symptoms. Myotonic Dystrophy (Option C): This genetic disorder causes progressive muscle weakness with myotonia (delayed muscle relaxation) and primarily affects distal muscles. The absence of myotonia and presence of generalized muscular weakness points away from this diagnosis. Guillain-Barré Syndrome (Option D): Guillain-Barré syndrome (GBS), the acute inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy, cardinally presents with acute-onset symmetric flaccid limb weakness.

Clinical Features of Migraine Premonitory (Prodromal) Phase Neck discomfort Cognitive impairment (brain “fog”) Mood changes Fatigue Yawning/sleepiness Increased urination and thirst Food cravings Aura Neurologic disturbances (e.g., visual disturbances like scintillating scotoma) Due to Cerebral vasoconstriction. Therefore prevention is by Vasodilators. Headache Phase Pain Nausea/vomiting Sensory sensitivities: Photophobia (sensitivity to light) Phonophobia (sensitivity to sound) Osmophobia (sensitivity to smells) Allodynia (pain from non-painful stimuli) Vertigo Due to cerebral vasodilation. So treatment is Vasoconstrictors Postdrome Tiredness Weariness Impaired concentration Simplified Diagnostic Criteria for Migraine by International Headache Society: Criteria: Repeated attacks of headache lasting 4–72h in patients with a normal physical examination, no other reasonable cause for the headache, and: At least 2 of the following features: Unilateral pain Throbbing pain Aggravation by movement Moderate or severe intensity Plus at least 1 of the following features: Nausea/vomiting Photophobia and phonophobia Hunger headache (Option A) is typically bilateral rather than unilateral and does not present with photophobia or throbbing pain. These headaches are generally diffuse and associated with hypoglycemia due to missed meals, improving rapidly with food intake. Tension headache (Option C) presents with bilateral, steady, pressing pain rather than unilateral throbbing pain. These headaches typically feel like a tight band around the head and are not characteristically aggravated by light or accompanied by photophobia. Cluster headache (Option D) presents with severe, strictly unilateral pain centered around the eye, often accompanied by autonomic symptoms such as lacrimation and nasal congestion. These headaches occur in clusters lasting weeks to months, with multiple short-duration attacks per day, and typically do not have the strong association with photophobia seen in this case.

      },
      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: C) Restrict water intake Explanation: The clinical manifestations indicate a post-lumbar puncture headache (PDPH). Restricting fluid intake is not a standard approach used in the management of PDPH Postdural puncture headache (PDPH) is a potential complication of a lumbar puncture, with symptoms caused by traction on pain-sensitive structures from low cerebrospinal fluid pressure (intracranial hypotension) following a leak of cerebrospinal fluid at the puncture site. Traumatic needles like Quincke, Babcock and also needles with lower gauge can cause PDPH. Definitive treatment with an epidural blood patch is recommended when symptoms persist even after conservative treatment. Management of PDPH: Bed rest for 8-12 hours Analgesics Intravenous caffeine Despite symptomatic treatment, if the headache persists: Low Volume Blood patch: For this procedure, 10 ml to 30 ml of autologous venous blood is injected by an anesthesiologist into the epidural space at the level of the prior procedure. This is thought to create a \"patch\" over the dural puncture and decrease CSF leak, or simply increase the intracranial pressure. Lie in a supine position (Option A) is a recommended first-line management strategy for post-lumbar puncture headaches. The supine position helps reduce cerebrospinal movement and fluid leakage through gravity and allows the dura to seal. Administer intravenous caffeine (Option B) is an appropriate intervention for post-lumbar puncture headaches. Caffeine acts as a vasoconstrictor, which can help reduce the headache by decreasing cerebral vessel dilation and improving cerebrospinal fluid production. Perform a low-volume blood patch (Option D) is a definitive treatment option for persistent post-lumbar puncture headaches that don't respond to conservative measures. This procedure involves injecting autologous blood into the epidural space to seal the CSF leak and provide headache relief.

      },
      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: A) Diplegia Explanation: The clinical manifestations indicate diplegia , a condition characterized by symmetric paralysis that predominantly affects the lower body while sparing or minimally affecting the upper limbs. The patient's clinical course shows an initial widespread paralysis that improved to primarily affect the lower trunk and legs, and only slight involvement of upper limbs, which is characteristic of diplegia. Quadriplegia (Option B) refers to paralysis of all four limbs and typically includes the torso. While the patient initially experienced widespread involvement, the final clinical picture with predominant lower body involvement does not correlate with quadriplegia. Paraplegia (Option C) involves complete paralysis of the lower half of the body, including both legs, but does not affect the arms. The patient's history of upper limb involvement and subsequent improvement makes paraplegia an incorrect diagnosis. Monoplegia (Option D) refers to paralysis affecting only one limb. The patient's presentation with bilateral leg and lower trunk involvement clearly indicates a more extensive pattern of paralysis than monoplegia.

        "C": "Anti-acetylcholine receptor antibody test",
        "D": "MRI of the brain"
      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: B) SFEMG Explanation: The clinical presentation strongly suggests Myasthenia Gravis (MG) based on the classic triad of symptoms : ptosis, diplopia, and fatigable muscle weakness. The hallmark pattern of weakness that worsens with activity and improves with rest , along with diurnal variation (symptoms worsening in the evening), is pathognomonic for MG. The positive Tensilon test further supports this diagnosis. In confirming this diagnosis, Single Fiber Electromyography (SFEMG) is the most sensitive test , with a sensitivity of up to 99%. In cases where there is clinical suspicion of MG, as evidenced by fatigable muscle weakness and positive Tensilon test, SFEMG is done as the confirmatory diagnostic tool. Although SFEMG is highly sensitive, the more commonly done confirmatory test is Repetitive Nerve Stimulation (RNS). Diagnosing Myasthenia Gravis (MG) Diagnosis involves a comprehensive approach integrating clinical evaluation and specific diagnostic tests. Clinical Evaluation: Recognizing the Signs History: Focus on the onset, progression, diurnal variation and fluctuating muscle weakness. Physical Examination: Assess muscle strength. Identify characteristic signs: Ptosis Diplopia Cogan's lid twitch sign Rule out other neurological conditions. Diagnostic Tests: Confirming the Suspicion Test Description Tensilon Test Administers edrophonium bromide intravenously. May show transient muscle function improvement; not highly reliable. Repetitive Nerve Stimulation (RNS) Specialized nerve conduction study. Reveals a decremental response in muscle strength with repeated stimulation, indicating impaired neuromuscular transmission. Single Fiber Electromyography (SFEMG) SFEMG techniques allow assessment of two important features of the motor unit: jitter and fiber density (FD). SFEMG is the most sensitive clinical test for neuromuscular junction disease and is often abnormal in clinically unaffected muscles in patients with myasthenia gravis (MG) and Lambert-Eaton myasthenia (LEM). Antibody Testing Detects auto-antibodies related to MG. Acetylcholine Receptor (AChR) Antibodies: Most common, block AChR function. Muscle-Specific Kinase (MuSK) Antibodies: Disrupt AChR clustering and stabilization. Thoracic CT Scan Essential to rule out thymoma, especially in patients with negative AChR antibody tests. CT scan of the chest (Option A) is used for evaluating thymus gland abnormalities such as thymoma, which occurs in approximately 10-15% of MG patients. While important in the overall evaluation, it is not the primary diagnostic test for confirming MG diagnosis. Anti-acetylcholine receptor antibody test (Option C) is highly specific for MG and is positive in about 85% of generalized MG cases. However, SFEMG is more sensitive, particularly in seronegative cases where antibody tests may be negative despite clinical disease. MRI of the brain (Option D) may be useful in ruling out other neurological conditions that can present with similar symptoms, such as multiple sclerosis or brainstem lesions. However, it does not provide specific diagnostic information for MG and is primarily used to exclude other conditions.",

      },
      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer A - Creutzfeldt jakob disease The disease associated with abnormal accumulation of misfolded proteins is Creutzfeldt Jakob disease affecting the brain. Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease (CJD) is a rare, rapidly progressing brain disorder affecting coordination, memory, and mental functions. Aetiology: CJD is caused by prions , which are abnormally folded proteins that induce other normal prion proteins to adopt the same harmful shape. These abnormal prion proteins accumulate in the brain, leading to nerve cell damage and the characteristic spongiform appearance (brain tissue with holes). The prion proteins disrupt normal brain functions, causing progressive neurological degeneration. Main symptoms: Severe mental deterioration (dementia) Involuntary muscle jerks (myoclonus) Early symptoms: Lack of coordination, walking/balance problems Impaired thinking, memory, judgment, mood changes, anxiety Confusion, insomnia, vision changes, unusual sensations Progression symptoms: Weakness, blindness, loss of movement or speech Pneumonia, infections, coma CJD types: Sporadic (unknown cause, 85% of cases) Hereditary (gene mutation, 10-15% of cases) Acquired (rare, from medical procedures or contaminated tissue) Variant CJD (linked to \"mad cow\" disease, affects younger people) Diagnosis: EEG, cerebrospinal fluid tests (14-3-3 protein), MRI Brain biopsy or autopsy for confirmation Treatment: No cure Symptom management (pain relief, muscle jerk control, comfort care) Nephritic syndrome (Option B) is primarily associated with immune-mediated damage and not the accumulation of misfolded proteins. In sickle cell anaemia (Option C) , while there is an abnormality in the structure of haemoglobin, it does not involve the accumulation of misfolded proteins as seen in CJD. Megaloblastic anaemia (Option D) is a type of anaemia characterized by the presence of large, immature red blood cells (megaloblasts) in the bone marrow. Megaloblastic anaemia does not involve the accumulation of misfolded proteins. Reference: https://www.ninds.nih.gov/health-information/disorders/creutzfeldt-jakob-disease",

However, a patient on this medication needs monitoring of his blood regularly due to the risk of agranulocytosis , a common side effect of clozapine. Mechanism of Action: Clozapine primarily works as a dopamine D2 receptor antagonist , but it also has significant effects on serotonin receptors (5-HT2A and 5-HT2C), which helps reduce symptoms in treatment-resistant cases. Side Effects: Severe risks: Agranulocytosis: Occurs in approximately 0.3% of users, necessitating regular monitoring of white blood cell counts.

      "explanation": "Correct Answer C - Lewy body: The scenario here points to the diagnosis of Lewy body dementia which is a neurodegenerative disorder characterised by dementia and signs of Parkinson’s disease. Lewy Body Dementia (LBD) includes Parkinson's disease dementia (PDD) and dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB), which are the second most common cause of neurodegenerative dementia after Alzheimer’s disease. Prevalence: The incidence of DLB is approximately 7 per 100,000 person-years, with both PDD and DLB becoming more common with age and affecting men more often than women. Cognitive Features: Common in both PDD and DLB : Severe executive, attentional, and visuospatial deficits with preserved episodic memory. Fluctuating cognition, visual hallucinations, and parkinsonism are key features, especially in DLB. Day-to-day variations in cognitive function are often seen, with periods of confusion or lethargy that resolve quickly. Motor Symptoms: Parkinsonism in DLB often includes postural instability, which can emerge early or later. Other Symptoms: REM sleep behavior disorder (RBD) is a common and early sign. Symptoms like anosmia, constipation, depression, and anxiety may precede or accompany the cognitive decline. Diagnostic Features: PDD typically develops after long-standing Parkinson’s disease with cognitive decline, visual hallucinations, and fluctuating attention. DLB involves early dementia and neuropsychiatric symptoms like hallucinations and fluctuating cognition, occurring alongside or before parkinsonism. Pathology: Lewy bodies and Lewy neurites are present in key brain areas, including the brainstem, substantia nigra, amygdala, and cortex. These inclusions are composed of α -synuclein aggregates, making LBD a synucleinopathy. The progression follows three stages: brainstem predominant, transitional limbic, and diffuse neocortical. Pathogenesis: Both genetic factors (e.g., α -synuclein duplications, mutations in the glucocerebrosidase gene) and environmental factors, such as toxins, may contribute to LBD development. LBD might spread via a prion-like mechanism, propagating from peripheral areas like the gastrointestinal system or olfactory bulb to the brain. Cholinergic and Adrenergic Deficits: DLB shows a profound cholinergic deficit, contributing to cognitive fluctuations and hallucinations. Adrenergic deficits, especially from the locus coeruleus, further impair alertness and arousal. Normal Pressure Hydrocephalus (NPH) (Option A) can cause a triad of symptoms known as Hakim's triad, which includes gait disturbances, urinary incontinence, and cognitive impairment. The triad is not present in the given scenario. Hypothyroidism (Option B) can lead to various symptoms, including cognitive impairment, depression, and memory problems. But the given scenario does not provide any relation to it. Vitamin B12 deficiency (Option D) can lead to neurological symptoms, including cognitive impairment and dementia-like symptoms. However, the given scenario is not associated with this. Reference: Harrison’s Principles of Internal Medicine, 21st Edition, Page: 3385, 3386.",

      },
      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "dialysis-related amyloidosis, is a condition that can affect individuals undergoing long-term dialysis due to end-stage renal disease. In this condition, beta-2 microglobulin, a protein that normally gets filtered out by healthy kidneys, accumulates in the blood due to reduced renal function. Over time, these elevated levels of beta-2 microglobulin can lead to its deposition in various tissues, including the cerebral cortex of the brain. This deposition can contribute to cognitive dysfunction and neurologic symptoms in patients with dialysis dementia. Incorrect Options: Option B - Amyloid beta microglobulin: This is not the correct answer. The term \"amyloid beta microglobulin\" is not a recognized term in the context of dialysis dementia or amyloid deposition. The accurate term is \"beta-2 microglobulin,\" as explained in option A. Option C - Amyloid transthyretin: This is not the correct answer. Transthyretin amyloidosis is a separate condition where transthyretin protein deposits as amyloid in various organs, causing systemic organ dysfunction. It is not specifically associated with dialysis dementia. Option D - Amyloid Beta: This is not the correct answer. Amyloid beta is a protein that is well-known for its involvement in Alzheimer's disease, where it forms plaques in the brain. However, in the context of dialysis dementia, the protein of concern is beta-2 microglobulin, as explained in option A.",

      "explanation": "known as Guillain-Barré Syndrome (GBS). GBS is an autoimmune disorder where the immune system mistakenly attacks the peripheral nervous system, leading to inflammation and demyelination of nerves. In the context of GBS, the antibodies produced against components of peripheral nerves belong primarily to the IgG class. IgG is the correct answer because IgG antibodies are the most involved immunoglobulins in GBS. These antibodies target myelin, which is the protective covering of nerve fibers, leading to impaired nerve conduction and the characteristic symptoms of muscle weakness, tingling, and paralysis seen in GBS patients. Incorrect Options: Option B - IgM: While IgM antibodies can be involved in certain autoimmune diseases, they are not typically associated with GBS. IgM antibodies are usually associated with early immune responses and are not as commonly found in autoimmune disorders affecting the nervous system. Option C - IgE: IgE antibodies are primarily associated with allergic reactions and parasitic infections. They are not a characteristic component of the immune response seen in GBS.

Tuberculous Meningitis Symptoms and Clinical Features: Headache , slight mental changes , and low-grade fever can develop over weeks, often accompanied by malaise , anorexia , and irritability . More severe cases present with confusion , lethargy , neck rigidity , and altered sensorium . Disease progression: evolves over 1–2 weeks, longer than bacterial meningitis. Cranial nerve palsies , especially ocular nerves, are common due to inflammation at the base of the brain. May result in coma , hydrocephalus , and intracranial hypertension if untreated. Cerebral ischemia can result from the involvement of cerebral arteries. Tuberculoma (space-occupying lesion) may cause seizures and focal neurological signs. CSF Findings: Elevated leukocyte count (up to 1000/ µ L, predominantly lymphocytes). High protein content (1-8 g/L). Low glucose concentration . Investigation of Choice: Culture of CSF (gold standard, takes 4-8 weeks, positive in ~50%). Smear for acid-fast bacilli (AFB) (low sensitivity, positive in 10-40%). PCR for Mycobacterium tuberculosis DNA (variable sensitivity). Imaging: CT/MRI may show hydrocephalus and abnormal enhancement of basal cisterns or ependyma.

      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: C) Temporal lobe Explanation: The inability to identify objects and the ability to determine the colour, texture, and shape of objects refer to visual agnosia, which is caused by lesions involving the temporal lobe. Features of Left Temporal Lobe Stroke Features of Right Temporal Lobe Stroke Impaired language and memory: Difficulty with spoken language and remembering verbal information. Fluent (Wernicke’s) aphasia: Fluent speech with incorrect words, affecting language comprehension. Poor visual memory and spatial awareness: Difficulty recognizing visual patterns and spatial information. Prosopagnosia : Inability to recognize faces, including familiar ones. General Features of Temporal Lobe Stroke Poor memory: Difficulty recalling memories and learning new information. Prosopagnosia: Trouble recognizing faces and objects. Fluent aphasia: Specifically in left-sided strokes, affecting speech fluency but with incorrect word use. Visual perception difficulties: Challenges with interpreting the visual field and surroundings. Trouble processing sound: Inability to differentiate or process sounds correctly. Visual agnosia: Inability to recognize visually presented objects despite otherwise normal visual field, acuity, colour vision, brightness, discrimination, language, and memory. Emotional and behavioural changes: Varying behaviours due to damage to the amygdala, such as aggression, passiveness, or difficulty interpreting facial cues. Incorrect Options: Lesions in a patient's Frontal lobe (Option A) can lead to certain symptoms such as trouble with learning, deficits in visual-motor function, executive dysfunction and problems with attention (planning, focusing, and inhibition). Parietal lobe (Option B) : Right - Damage to this area can cause visuospatial deficits (e.g., the patient may have difficulty finding their way around new, or even familiar, places). Parietal Lobe, Left: Damage to this area may disrupt a person's ability to understand spoken and/or written language. Unilateral Occipital lobe (Option D) lesion causes contralateral homonymous hemianopia. It is a visual field defect on the same side of both eyes contralateral to the site of the lesion - lesions of the occipital lobe due to the posterior cerebral artery infarct cause homonymous hemianopia with macular sparing.

      "question": "A patient is brought to the OPD by his wife complaining about difficulty in expressing emotions and not taking part in daily activities. On examination, resting tremors and rigidity are noted. Given the possible diagnosis, which part of the brain is affected in this patient?",
      "options": {
        "A": "Basal ganglia",
        "B": "Hippocampus",
        "C": "Cerebellum",
        "D": "Premotor cortex"
      },
      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer A - Basal ganglia The patient's presentation of difficulty expressing emotions, lack of participation in daily activities, resting tremors, and rigidity is highly suggestive of Parkinson's disease. Parkinson's disease is primarily caused by degeneration of the substantia nigra, a structure located in the basal ganglia. This degeneration results in reduced dopamine production, which affects the motor control pathways, leading to the hallmark symptoms of rigidity, tremors, and bradykinesia. The basal ganglia is a group of nuclei in the brain involved in motor control, as well as cognitive and emotional functions. The degeneration of dopamine-producing neurons in the substantia nigra disrupts the communication between the basal ganglia and other parts of the brain, resulting in the characteristic motor and non-motor symptoms seen in Parkinson's disease. Other Features of Parkinson's Disease: Rigidity: Increased muscle tone causing resistance to passive movement. Resting tremors: Involuntary, rhythmic shaking that occurs when the muscles are relaxed. Bradykinesia: Slowness of movement, making daily tasks more difficult. Postural instability: Difficulty maintaining balance, leading to falls. Hippocampus (Option B): The hippocampus is primarily involved in memory formation, learning, and spatial navigation, and lesions here can lead to issues with memory and emotional behavior. However, it is not primarily associated with the motor symptoms seen in Parkinson's disease. Cerebellum (Option C): The cerebellum is responsible for coordinating voluntary movement and balance. Lesions in the cerebellum typically cause ataxia, intention tremors, and gait disturbances, but not the resting tremors or rigidity characteristic of Parkinson's disease. Premotor cortex (Option D): The premotor cortex is involved in the planning and preparation of movements, particularly in coordinating postural adjustments for voluntary movements. While damage here can affect motor planning, it is not typically associated with the specific motor symptoms seen in Parkinson's disease.

      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer C - Herpes simplex virus The patient presents with fever, headache, confusion, and seizures, symptoms highly suggestive of encephalitis. Neurological examination reveals personality changes and altered consciousness, raising suspicion for focal neurological involvement. MRI: Shows bitemporal lobe hyperintensities, a hallmark feature of HSV encephalitis. Focal Neurological Signs: Symptoms linked to temporal lobe pathology, such as behavioral changes and impaired mental status. HSV Encephalitis HSV encephalitis is a rapidly progressive, life-threatening condition, often presenting with: Seizures: Focal or generalized. Neurological symptoms: Aphasia, ataxia, cranial nerve deficits. Behavioral and cognitive changes: Altered sensorium, memory impairment, personality changes (sometimes misdiagnosed as personality disorders). Additional Features: Urinary/fecal incontinence. Aseptic meningitis. Dermatomal rashes. Rarely, Guillain-Barré syndrome. Diagnosis CSF Analysis: Lymphocytic pleocytosis, normal glucose, mild protein elevation. CSF PCR for HSV: Gold standard with 96% sensitivity, 99% specificity. Neuroimaging (MRI): T2-weighted/DWI: Hyperintensities in temporal and orbitofrontal lobes. EEG: Periodic slow-wave activity in the temporal lobes, highly suggestive of HSV encephalitis. Management Antiviral Therapy: Early initiation of IV acyclovir to prevent permanent neurological damage.

On MRI, CMV encephalitis often shows enlarged ventricles and periventricular calcifications, not the typical temporal lobe findings seen in HSV encephalitis. Toxoplasma gondii (Option B): Toxoplasmosis primarily affects immunocompromised patients (e.g., HIV/AIDS). It usually presents with multiple brain lesions, commonly affecting the basal ganglia and corticomedullary junction, which would be visible on MRI. Mycobacterium tuberculosis (TB) (Option D): TB encephalitis, which is more common in children or immunocompromised individuals, can present with cerebral edema, seizures, and decreased consciousness. However, TB typically affects the cerebral cortex more diffusely and is less likely to cause bitemporal lobe involvement, as seen in HSV encephalitis.",

      "correct_answer": "D",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: D) Subacute combined degeneration of the cord The clinical features described in this case—sensory loss, weakness of limbs, angular stomatitis, loss of proprioception and vibration sensation, UMN-type weakness, and absent ankle reflexes—are highly suggestive of subacute combined degeneration of the cord (SACD), which is a condition caused by vitamin B12 deficiency. Subacute Combined Degeneration of the Cord (SACD) Neurological disorder due to vitamin B12 deficiency, causing demyelination of the posterior columns and lateral corticospinal tracts. Etiology Vitamin B12 Deficiency: Pernicious anemia. Gastrectomy or ileal resection. Diphyllobothrium latum infestation. Long-term use of metformin or PPIs. Affected Areas Posterior columns: Loss of proprioception and vibration sense. Lateral corticospinal tracts: Spasticity and UMN-type weakness. Clinical Features Sensory Symptoms: Loss of proprioception and vibration sense: Begins in lower limbs, may progress to upper limbs. Sensory ataxia: Positive Romberg’s test (difficulty standing with eyes closed). Paresthesia: Tingling or numbness in extremities, typically in a glove-and-stocking distribution. Motor Symptoms: Upper motor neuron signs: Weakness, spasticity, and hyperreflexia. Spastic weakness: Due to lateral corticospinal tract involvement. Absent ankle reflex: A key finding, coexisting with UMN signs due to concurrent peripheral neuropathy. Signs: Lhermitte's Sign: Electric shock-like sensation down the spine on neck flexion. Angular stomatitis Optic neuropathy Non-neurological Features: Megaloblastic anemia: fatigue, pallor, glossitis, and jaundice. Psychiatric Symptoms: Irritability, dementia, psychosis. Depression and memory loss. Treatment Vitamin B12 Replacement: IM cyanocobalamin or hydroxocobalamin. Oral B12 for maintenance. Address underlying causes (e.g., anemia, parasitic infestation). Extradural cord compression (Option A), caused by a space-occupying lesion (e.g., tumor or abscess), typically presents with localized back pain, radicular symptoms, and bladder/bowel dysfunction. It typically causes asymmetric neurological deficits, unlike the symmetrical loss of proprioception, vibration, and UMN signs seen in subacute combined degeneration. Additionally, it does not cause angular stomatitis, which is indicative of vitamin B12 deficiency Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) (Option B) primarily affects lower motor neurons and upper motor neurons. It presents with fasciculations, muscle cramps, muscle weakness, and atrophy, as well as bulbar palsy symptoms (dysarthria, dysphagia). Absence of sensory loss is a key differentiator here, as ALS does not typically affect sensory pathways. Multiple sclerosis (MS) (Option C): MS is an autoimmune demyelinating disease of the central nervous system, affecting both white matter in the brain and spinal cord. It commonly presents with symptoms like paresthesia, optical neuritis, weakness, and gait disturbances. Lhermitte’s sign (pain down the back with neck flexion) and Uhthoff's sign (worsening of symptoms with heat) are classic, but the sensory loss and angular stomatitis here point more toward vitamin B12 deficiency rather than MS.",

      "explanation": "Correct Answer: A) Parkinson's disease This patient's symptoms, including progressive decline in daily activities, convulsions, visual hallucinations, and the presence of Lewy bodies on pathological examination, point toward Parkinson's disease. Parkinson's Disease: Parkinson's disease is a neurodegenerative disorder caused by the degeneration of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra. Pathological examination reveals Lewy bodies, which are proteinaceous inclusions found in neurons, particularly in the substantia nigra. These are composed of alpha-synuclein and are characteristic of Parkinson's disease. Clinical features include rigidity, resting tremor, bradykinesia, and postural instability. In later stages, non-motor symptoms like cognitive decline, visual hallucinations, sleep disturbances, and depression can occur, which align with the symptoms observed in this patient. Treatment typically includes levodopa with a peripheral decarboxylase inhibitor (like carbidopa), dopamine agonists (e.g., pramipexole, ropinirole), and MAO-B inhibitors (e.g., selegiline, rasagiline).

The negative Gram stain further supports mycobacterial infection rather than typical bacterial pathogens . Tuberculous Meningitis Symptoms and Clinical Features: Headache , slight mental changes , and low-grade fever can develop over weeks, often accompanied by malaise , anorexia , and irritability . More severe cases present with confusion , lethargy , neck rigidity , and altered sensorium . Disease progression: evolves over 1–2 weeks, longer than bacterial meningitis.

Bacterial meningitis (Option B): Bacterial meningitis typically presents with acute onset (<24-48 hours), neutrophilic predominance in CSF, and positive Gram stain. The subacute presentation and lymphocytic CSF make bacterial meningitis unlikely. Fungal meningitis (Option C): While fungal meningitis can present with similar CSF findings, including low glucose and high protein, it typically occurs in immunocompromised patients and does not usually present with characteristic upper lobe chest X-ray findings. The presence of pulmonary involvement strongly suggests tuberculosis. Viral meningitis (Option D): Viral meningitis typically presents with normal to mildly elevated protein levels, normal glucose levels, and absence of cobweb coagulum. The markedly elevated protein (3000mg/dl) and low glucose are inconsistent with viral etiology.",

      },
      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer A- Guillain-Barré syndrome The patient presents with classic features of Guillain-Barré syndrome (GBS) including antecedent respiratory tract infection, progressive ascending symmetrical weakness, and areflexia. GBS is an autoimmune polyradiculopathy causing patchy segmental demyelination of spinal cord and peripheral nerves. The temporal relationship with infection, pattern of weakness, and preserved sensory function are characteristic of GBS. Category Symptoms Motor Symptoms Progressive ascending paralysis (distal to proximal) Areflexia Weakness in legs causing rubbery legs and instability to stand Truncal paralysis, quadriplegia, neck floppiness Bilateral 7th nerve palsy Bulbar palsy Difficulty in handling secretions leading to aspiration pneumonia A leading cause of death due to pulmonary involvement. Diaphragmatic paralysis Ventilatory support is required in 30% of cases. Increased carbon dioxide levels. Sensory Symptoms Glove-and-stocking distribution paresthesias Proprioception loss Difficulty in climbing stairs Pain in the neck/arm/shoulder is similar to over-exercised muscle Sensory manifestations can occur before or along with motor manifestations. Autonomic Symptoms Autonomic dysregulation (e.g., orthostatic hypotension, bladder/bowel sparing/transient involvement) Wide fluctuations of blood pressure, arrhythmias, postural hypotension Reduced heart rate and blood pressure, neurogenic shock. Myasthenia gravis (Option B): Weakness in myasthenia gravis typically worsens with repeated use of the affected muscles and improves with rest. Additionally, it often affects the muscles of the face and eyes before involving the limbs. The ascending pattern and areflexia are not typical features of myasthenia gravis. Polymyositis (Option C): Polymyositis presents with symmetric proximal muscle weakness primarily affecting the shoulder and hip girdle muscles, making activities like climbing stairs or raising arms above the head difficult. Patients maintain normal reflexes and have no sensory involvement. The absence of proximal muscle pattern, presence of areflexia, and absence of ascending weakness pattern make polymyositis unlikely. Multiple sclerosis (Option D): Multiple sclerosis typically follows a relapsing-remitting course with scattered neurological manifestations. Common presentations include visual symptoms like optic neuritis and sensory symptoms such as paresthesias and numbness. Patients often demonstrate hyperreflexia rather than areflexia.

      "question": "A woman presents with a history of headaches for the past 9 months that worsen in a recumbent position and improves as the day progresses. She also gives a history of taking oral contraceptives. Fundal examination shows papilledema. There are no focal neurological deficits. What is the probable cause of her headaches?",
      "options": {
        "A": "Myasthenia gravis",
        "B": "Temporal arteritis",
        "C": "Chronic migraine",
        "D": "Pseudotumor cerebri"
      },
      "correct_answer": "D",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer D- Pseudotumor cerebri The clinical manifestations such as presence of characteristic headaches that worsen when lying down, papilledema on fundal examination , and the absence of focal neurological deficits indicate pseudotumor cerebri , also known as idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH) . This condition is characterized by increased intracranial pressure without any identifiable cause such as a tumor. The patient's use of oral contraceptives is a notable risk factor , as hormonal medications can contribute to the development of this condition. Pseudotumor Cerebri / Idiopathic Intracranial Hypertension Definition A disorder associated with elevated CSF pressure without obvious cause, commonly affecting young, obese females Key Symptoms Headache (worse on waking and with recumbency) Visual disturbances (may be transient) Can occur without visual problems Worse in morning or after lying down Pulsatile tinnitus may be present Diagnostic Criteria Elevated CSF pressure (>20-25 cm H2O) Normal MRI/MRV findings Normal neurological examination (except for papilledema) Papilledema may be present (but not required for diagnosis) Initial Treatment Acetazolamide (250-500 mg) Weight loss (if overweight) Serial lumbar punctures may be needed Regular ophthalmologic monitoring Secondary Treatment Topiramate Other carbonic anhydrase inhibitors CSF shunting procedures (if needed) Weight loss management programs Monitoring Regular visual field testing Ophthalmic examination CSF pressure monitoring Weight monitoring Headache diary Important Considerations Fundoscopic exam should be performed even without overt ophthalmic involvement Consider diagnosis in chronic migraine cases May require long-term management Early intervention is crucial for preventing vision loss Myasthenia gravis (Option A) primarily presents with muscle weakness and fatigue, particularly affecting ocular and bulbar muscles. The absence of muscle weakness/headache and the presence of papilledema make this diagnosis unlikely. Temporal arteritis (Option B) typically affects older adults over 50 years and presents with temporal headache, jaw claudication, and scalp tenderness. Also, the patient's presentation of papilledema is not a typical feature of Temporal arteritis. Chronic migraine (Option C) is characterized by headaches occurring on 15 or more days per month for at least three months. While the timeframe is similar, the presence of papilledema and positional nature of the headache are not typical features of migraine.

Huntington’s Disease (HD): A progressive, fatal, autosomal dominant disorder. Characterized by motor, behavioral, oculomotor, and cognitive dysfunction. Onset typically between 25-45 years. Pathophysiology: Affects the striatum, progressing to involve the cerebral cortex. Caused by >40 CAG repeats in the huntingtin gene on chromosome 4. Clinical Features: Early-stage: Focal or segmental chorea. Late-stage: Dystonia , rigidity, bradykinesia, and myoclonus. Behavioral changes: Depression, aggression, psychosis, and suicidal tendencies. Cognitive impairment leading to dementia. Non-neurological features: Diabetes mellitus and hypothalamic dysfunction. Parkinson’s disease (Option A) is characterized by both hyperkinetic movements such as resting tremor and hypokinetic features like rigidity, stiffness, and bradykinesia. Wilson’s disease (Option B) results from basal ganglia damage, leading to hyperkinetic features such as dystonia and tremor, and hypokinetic features like parkinsonism with bradykinesia. Additionally, it can cause incoordination, dysarthria, dysphagia, and in advanced stages, a characteristic wing-beating (flapping) tremor. Neurodegeneration with brain iron accumulation (Option C) presents with a combination of hyperkinetic movements, including dystonia, and hypokinetic features, such as parkinsonism, along with spasticity.

      "explanation": "Correct Answer: C) Doing EEG is mandatory for diagnosis of seizures Explanation: Doing EEG is not mandatory for diagnosis of seizures. Electroencephalography (EEG): Records electrical activity in the brain using electrodes placed on the scalp. It is a dynamic test, EEG frequencies and distribution vary based on factors like brain maturation, age, alertness, and medication. NICE Guidelines: Emphasize not relying solely on EEG for diagnosis. It should be used to: Define seizure type and syndrome. Guide treatment and prognosis. EEG is critical when: Non-convulsive status epilepticus is suspected. Continuous Spike Wave in Slow Wave Sleep (CSWS) is suspected. Avoid in Certain Cases: EEG should not be requested for children with autistic regression. EEG is not needed in developmentally/neurologically normal children with simple or complex febrile seizures. Repeat EEG: Once a seizure type or syndrome has been diagnosed, repeat EEGs have limited value for monitoring treatment or deciding on drug withdrawal. 1-5% of the population can have epileptiform discharges (Option A) : This statement is correct. These discharges are not specific to epilepsy, and even in known epilepsy cases, routine interictal EEG can be normal in 60% of cases. Therefore, EEG cannot establish the diagnosis of epilepsy in many individuals. Scalp EEG may be useful in localizing frontal focal seizures (Option B) : However, it is often misleading or normal, particularly when seizures arise from areas distant from the scalp, such as the inferior frontal or medial temporal lobe. In such cases, the EEG may not localize the seizures or may show non-specific activity. Progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PMLE) shows triphasic and slow waves on EEG (Option D) : EEG in PMLE typically shows slow background activity and triphasic and slow waves, predominantly in the frontal regions.

      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer A - CT angiography to look for large vessel occlusion: The clinical scenario of an older man presenting with acute onset right-sided weakness, aphasia, high blood pressure, and a clear non-contrast CT scan points toward the diagnosis of acute ischemic stroke . The next step is to perform CT angiography to identify large vessel occlusion , as this guides the decision for mechanical thrombectomy or thrombolysis. Workup for stroke Initial Assessment and Stabilization Upon arrival, ensure the ABCs (Airway, Breathing, Circulation) are stable. Blood glucose levels should be checked quickly to address hypoglycemia or hyperglycemia. Determining Stroke Type: Imaging is Key A non-contrast CT scan is the primary imaging modality for differentiating between ischemic and hemorrhagic strokes. Clinical features may suggest stroke type, but imaging is essential for confirmation as no clinical finding can definitively differentiate between the two. Further Investigations: Uncovering the Cause Detailed History and Physical Exam: Consider risk factors (hypertension, diabetes, smoking, atrial fibrillation, etc.) and perform a neurological exam to localize the affected brain area. Laboratory Tests: Perform CBC, electrolytes, renal function, blood glucose, lipid profile, coagulation studies, ESR, and ECG (to detect arrhythmias and signs of recent MI). Visualizing the Cerebral Vasculature: Imaging Techniques CT Angiography (CTA) : Assesses cerebral vasculature and identifies blockages/stenosis , but is performed after non-contrast CT has ruled out hemorrhage (not for stroke type differentiation). CT Perfusion Imaging : Assesses blood flow, identifying reduced perfusion and ischemic penumbra. MRI: Provides more detail but takes longer than CT and is not as widely available, thus not the first imaging choice for acute stroke evaluation. (Option B) MRA: Offers detailed images of blood vessels, similar to CTA. Cerebral Angiography: Gold standard for vessel evaluation, used when other techniques are inconclusive or before endovascular intervention. Ultrasound Techniques : Carotid Duplex Ultrasonography assesses carotid stenosis but is not a first-line acute imaging modality; Transcranial Doppler (TCD) measures blood flow velocity in intracranial arteries. Tailoring Investigations Based on Stroke Type Ischemic Stroke : Focuses on identifying the source of the blockage (cardioembolic, artery-to-artery embolic, small vessel disease). Hemorrhagic Stroke: Investigations focus on identifying causes of bleeding (e.g., hypertension, aneurysm, vascular malformation). Tablet labetalol 10 mg stat (Option C): Labetalol is a first-line antihypertensive in acute stroke management, especially to control elevated blood pressure. However, before administering any antihypertensive medication, the priority is to determine the presence of large vessel occlusion using CT angiography. Thrombolysis (Option D) with alteplase is first-line therapy for acute ischemic stroke, but it is only effective if there is no large vessel occlusion. CT angiography is essential to assess for large vessel occlusion. If present, mechanical thrombectomy is preferred, making CT angiography a necessary first step before thrombolysis.

      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer B - Subcutaneous sumatriptan: For an acute attack of cluster headache, the treatment of choice is 100% oxygen at 10-12 L/minute and subcutaneous sumatriptan. Cluster Headache: Rare primary headache, with a prevalence of ~0.1%, characterized by excruciating, nonfluctuating, retro-orbital pain of explosive quality. Periodicity: Attacks occur daily, with one or two short-duration, unilateral pain episodes lasting 15-180 minutes. Cluster bouts last for weeks, followed by a pain-free interval, typically lasting less than a year. Chronic cluster headache is defined by <3 months of sustained remission. Symptoms: Ipsilateral autonomic symptoms: Conjunctival injection, lacrimation, nasal congestion, and aural fullness. Sympathetic dysfunction (e.g., ptosis) Unilateral photophobia and phonophobia Treatment of Acute Attack of Cluster Headache: Oxygen: Inhaled 100% oxygen at 10-12 L/min for 15-20 minutes. (Option C & D) Sumatriptan: Subcutaneous 6 mg is effective , reducing attack duration to 10-15 minutes. Sumatriptan and Zolmitriptan Nasal Sprays: Effective alternatives for patients who prefer not to self-inject. Noninvasive Vagus Nerve Stimulation (nVNS): FDA approved for episodic cluster headache; involves three 2-minute stimulation cycles at headache onset. Oral sumatriptan (Option A) is not suitable for acute cluster headache attacks because it may not provide the same rapid relief as subcutaneous sumatriptan.

      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer B - ALS The patient's progressive bilateral limb weakness, muscle wasting, positive Babinski sign, absent deep tendon reflexes, and absence of sensory or autonomic dysfunction are consistent with Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS) . Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS): ALS is the most common progressive motor neuron disease and a prime example of neurodegenerative disorders. Genetic Causes: Mutant Proteins: SOD1, ubiquilin-1/-2, and p62 mutations disrupt protein degradation. RNA Processing: C9orf72, TDP43, and FUS mutations affect RNA transport/processing. Axonal Transport: Mutations in dynactin and profilin-1 affect axonal transport. Pathology: The hallmark of ALS is the death of both lower motor neurons (anterior horn cells and brainstem motor neurons) and upper motor neurons (corticospinal neurons). ALS involves both denervation and muscle atrophy, particularly in proximal muscles, and results in selective loss of motor neurons. Clinical Manifestations: Lower Motor Neuron Dysfunction: Asymmetric muscle weakness , muscle cramping, fasciculations, muscle atrophy and bulbar palsy. Upper Motor Neuron Dysfunction: Reflex hyperactivity , muscle stiffness, spasticity and pseudobulbar palsy. Corticobulbar Projection Degeneration: Results in dysarthria (speech difficulty) and pseudobulbar affect (excessive weeping or laughing). Symmetric Muscle Involvement: Over time, more muscle groups become involved , leading to a symmetric distribution of the disorder in all regions. Preserved Sensory and Cognitive Functions: Sensory, bowel and bladder , and cognitive functions are preserved even in the late stages. Ocular Motility Sparing: Ocular motility remains unaffected until the very late stages of ALS. Treatment: No treatment halts the underlying ALS pathology. Riluzole: Reduces excitotoxicity via decreased glutamate release. Edaravone: Acts as an antioxidant and it modestly reduces disability progression. Phenylbutyrate and Taurursodiol: Oral combination shown to slow disease progression and extend survival by improving mitochondrial and endoplasmic reticulum function. Multiple sclerosis (Option A) typically presents with relapsing-remitting episodes, optic neuritis, and a combination of upper motor neuron (UMN) and sensory deficits, which are absent in this case, and the patient lacks the characteristic visual and brainstem symptoms like ataxia and nystagmus. Guillain-barre syndrome (Option C) causes rapidly progressive ascending paralysis with areflexia, sensory involvement, and autonomic dysfunction, which this patient does not exhibit, as the weakness is bilateral and progressive over a longer period without sensory loss. Tropical spastic paraparesis (Option D) is associated with spastic paraparesis, sensory deficits, and bladder disturbances but no lower motor neuron (LMN) involvement, which contrasts with this patient's presentation of muscle wasting (suggestive of LMN involvement) and absence of bladder dysfunction.",

        "D": "Cluster headache"
      },
      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: A) Medication overuse headache Explanation: The scenario here suggests overuse of analgesics and hence the diagnosis of medication overuse headache. Medication overuse headache (MOH) is a secondary headache because it results from the frequent use of headache medication, unlike tension-type headaches, migraines, and primary stabbing headaches, which are all primary headaches. This develops due to the overuse of analgesics for already-existing headaches. This overuse induces MOH, which leads the patient to take more analgesics, thereby increasing the frequency of headaches, thus forming a vicious cycle. Main Risk Factors for MOH: Demographic Age (less than 50 years) Female Low educational level Self-reported complaints Chronic musculoskeletal complaints Gastrointestinal complaints Anxiety or depression Lifestyle Smoking Physical inactivity Metabolic syndrome High daily caffeine intake (greater than 540mg versus less than 240mg) Medication Tranquillizers Aspirin Ibuprofen Opioids Treatment of Medication Overuse Headache (MOH) Patient Education and Prevention Educate on appropriate medication use and risks of MOH. Emphasize the importance of limiting acute headache medications to ≤ 2 days per week. Medication Discontinuation Strategies Stop overused medication abruptly (preferred for most patients) and start/optimize preventive therapy, titrated based on individual factors. Gradual tapering: Useful for Opioids, Barbiturates, or Benzodiazepines (2-4 weeks for high doses; transdermal clonidine or phenobarbital may help with withdrawal). Preventive Medications Beta-blockers, calcium channel blockers, TCAs, and anticonvulsants. Topiramate and OnabotulinumtoxinA (useful, especially in chronic migraine with MOH). Bridge Therapy NSAIDs: Naproxen, Indomethacin, Ketorolac Adjuncts: Tizanidine with NSAIDs, antiemetics (Prochlorperazine, Metoclopramide), and dihydroergotamine (DHE) for severe cases. Raskin protocol: IV DHE + Metoclopramide every 8 hours. Alternative Approaches Withdrawal symptoms management: NSAIDs, hydration, antiemetics, magnesium, and lidocaine infusions. Discontinuation first approach: Avoid starting preventive therapy for 2 months post-medication discontinuation (less tolerated). Incorrect Options: In tension headaches (Option B) , the pain is described as a dull, bilateral ache, often associated with neck tension, stress, and fatigue. Migraine (Option C) sufferers describe a prodrome of fatigue, neck discomfort, mood changes, increased urination and thirst, and cognitive impairment. Typical migraine symptoms include a strong, throbbing headache, photophobia, phonophobia, osmophobia, allodynia and vomiting. Cluster headaches (Option D) are known for their unilateral, severe pain typically located around the eye, often described as retro-orbital pain. They are more common in males and can be associated with other symptoms such as nasal congestion and watering of the eyes.

      "explanation": "Correct Answer: A) Posterior inferior cerebellar artery Explanation: Wallenberg syndrome presents with pain, numbness, impaired sensation over one half of the face, horner syndrome, diplopia, numbness of the ipsilateral arm, trunk and leg. Occlusion of the posterior inferior cerebral artery is responsible for Wallenberg syndrome as it supplies the lateral medulla. Blood Supply of the Brain: The brain is primarily supplied by two systems: the anterior circulation from the internal carotid arteries and the posterior circulation from the vertebral arteries . These arteries anastomose to form the Circle of Willis , providing collateral circulation between the anterior and posterior blood supplies. 1. Internal Carotid Artery (ICA) Branches : Ophthalmic artery : Supplies the eye and orbital structures. Posterior communicating artery (PCoA) : Connects the internal carotid artery with the posterior cerebral artery. Anterior cerebral artery (ACA) : Supplies medial portions of the frontal and parietal lobes. Middle cerebral artery (MCA) : The largest branch, supplies the lateral aspect of the brain. Internal carotid artery occlusion can cause ischemia in MCA or ACA territory or a watershed (border zone) infarct between these areas. 2. Anterior Cerebral Artery (ACA) Supply : Medial portions of the frontal and parietal lobes, including the superior portion of the motor and sensory cortices (leg area). ACA Stroke : Contralateral weakness and sensory loss, primarily affecting the lower limb (leg > arm). Frontal lobe symptoms, including abulia (lack of initiative) and personality changes. Urinary incontinence due to damage to the medial frontal lobes. 3. Middle Cerebral Artery (MCA) Supply : Lateral surface of the frontal, parietal, and temporal lobes; basal ganglia; and internal capsule. MCA Stroke : Contralateral hemiparesis and hemisensory loss (face and arm > leg). Aphasia if the dominant hemisphere (usually left) is affected. Hemineglect if the non-dominant hemisphere is involved. Homonymous hemianopia due to optic radiation involvement. 4. Posterior Cerebral Artery (PCA) Supply : Occipital lobe (visual cortex), inferior temporal lobe, thalamus, and parts of the midbrain. PCA Stroke : Contralateral homonymous hemianopia (loss of the same side of the visual field in both eyes). Thalamic pain syndrome (Dejerine-Roussy syndrome) if the thalamus is involved, leading to contralateral sensory loss followed by chronic pain. Memory disturbances if the temporal lobe is affected. 5. Vertebral Arteries Branches : Posterior inferior cerebellar artery (PICA) : Supplies the cerebellum and lateral medulla. PICA Stroke : Wallenberg syndrome (lateral medullary syndrome): Causes ipsilateral facial numbness, contralateral body numbness, ataxia, vertigo, and dysphagia. 6. Basilar Artery (Option D) Supply : Pons, midbrain, occipital lobes, and cerebellum. Branches : Anterior inferior cerebellar artery (AICA) : Supplies the cerebellum and parts of the brainstem. Superior cerebellar artery (SCA) : Supplies the superior cerebellum and parts of the midbrain. Posterior cerebral arteries (PCA) : Terminal branches that supply the occipital lobe. Basilar Artery Stroke : Locked-in syndrome : Quadriplegia with preserved consciousness and vertical eye movements due to damage to the pons.

      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: B) Loss of myelin sheath Explanation: The slowing of conduction in multiple sclerosis is due to the loss of myelin sheath. Multiple sclerosis Multiple sclerosis (MS) is an autoimmune disease of the central nervous system characterized by chronic inflammation, demyelination , gliosis (plaques or scarring), and neuronal loss. The course can be relapsing or progressive. Pathophysiology: Immune hypothesis: Increased T lymphocytes in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and higher immunoglobulin synthesis in the CNS Blood-brain barrier (BBB) injury: Activated T lymphocytes cross the blood-brain barrier, recognize myelin antigens on nervous system antigen-presenting cells (microglia) and proliferate Demyelination: Inflammatory cascade releases cytokines, leading to oligodendrocyte - myelin destruction by macrophages Lesions: disintegration of myelin , lymphocyte/macrophage infiltration, and perivascular inflammation Ectopic lymphoid follicles are linked to demyelination and neuronal loss in the cerebral cortex Diffusible factors from these lymphoid cells may cause demyelination and neurodegeneration Axonal damage: Demyelination reduces trophic support for axons, redistributes ion channels, and destabilizes action potential membrane potentials Neuronal and axonal death may result from glutamate excitotoxicity, oxidative injury, iron accumulation, and mitochondrial failure Inflammatory mediators like nitric oxide initiate and worsen axonal damage Axons can adapt initially to these injuries, but over time, distal and retrograde degeneration (“dying-back” axonopathy) occurs Axonal loss accumulates over time due to repeated attacks and lack of neurotrophic factors from oligodendrocytes Plaque formation: After acute attacks, gliosis occurs by astrocyte cells, forming scars. Surviving oligodendrocytes partially remyelinate axons causing shadow plaques. Oligodendrocyte precursor cells often fail to differentiate into myelin-producing cells. Long-term myelin loss leads to reduced impulse propagation and conduction block, impairing CNS functions. Gliosis (Option A): This refers to the proliferation of glial cells (especially astrocytes) in response to central nervous system injury. While gliosis occurs in MS as part of the tissue response to demyelination and inflammation, it is not the primary cause of slowed conduction. Instead, it is a secondary effect resulting from the damage. Defect at the Node of Ranvier (Option C): Nodes of Ranvier are small gaps in the myelin sheath where voltage-gated sodium channels are concentrated, allowing for the rapid \"jumping\" of action potentials (saltatory conduction). Although defects at these nodes can disrupt impulse propagation, in multiple sclerosis the main problem is the loss of myelin rather than a defect in the nodes themselves. Leaky Na I Channels (Option D): In demyelinated axons, the redistribution or abnormal functioning of sodium channels can occur, which may contribute to conduction issues. However, this change is a consequence of myelin loss rather than a primary cause of conduction slowing. The loss of the insulating myelin sheath is the key factor impairing the proper function of these channels.",

      "explanation": "Correct Answer A - Optic tract Wernicke's pupil occurs due to a lesion at the optic tract , leading to incongruous homonymous hemianopia. Wernicke’s Hemianopic Pupil: Indicates a lesion in the optic tract. Light Reflex: Ipsilateral direct and contralateral consensual light reflexes are both absent in the affected areas. Absent when light is shone on the temporal half of the retina of the affected side and the nasal half of the opposite side. Present when light is shone on the nasal half of the affected side and the temporal half of the opposite side. Visual cortex (Option B): Lesions in the visual cortex, located in the occipital lobe, cause congruous homonymous hemianopia (same field defect in both eyes) and do not produce Wernicke's pupil, which is specific to lesions in the optic tract. Optic radiations (Option C): Lesions in the optic radiations also result in congruous homonymous hemianopia but do not lead to Wernicke's pupil. Optic nerve (Option D): Lesions in the optic nerve cause monocular vision loss (loss of vision in one eye), not homonymous hemianopia, and therefore do not result in Wernicke's pupil.

      },
      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: A) Normal pressure hydrocephalus Explanation: The patient's symptoms of behavioral changes, falls, urinary incontinence, and dementia are indicative of Normal Pressure Hydrocephalus (NPH) , which is commonly associated with the classic triad of gait disturbance, urinary incontinence, and cognitive decline . Normal Pressure Hydrocephalus (NPH) NPH is often idiopathic but can result from prior injuries affecting cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) dynamics, such as subarachnoid hemorrhage. Clinical Triad Gait disturbance : Progressive difficulties in walking Urinary issues : Urgency or incontinence Cognitive impairment : Decline in cognitive functions Imaging Characteristics Ventriculomegaly is typically seen Evans ratio : the ratio of the maximum width of frontal horns to inner table width of more than 0.31 is often used for evaluation but has low diagnostic accuracy. An acute callosal angle (less than 90°) on coronal MR images is another measurement used, also with limited accuracy. A disproportionately enlarged subarachnoid space hydrocephalus is seen having ventriculomegaly combined with sulcal effacement at the vertex and scattered enlarged sulci. CSF flow study shows hyper-dynamism with a streak of flow void through cerebral aqueduct. Frontotemporal dementia (Option B) (FTD) primarily affects personality, behavior, and language, often presenting with early changes such as disinhibition, apathy, and loss of empathy. Urinary incontinence is not a typical early feature of FTD, and gait disturbances or falls are also not commonly seen at the onset, making it less likely in this case. Parkinson's disease (Option C) primarily presents with motor symptoms such as bradykinesia, resting tremor, rigidity, and postural instability. While dementia and falls can occur in the later stages, urinary incontinence is not a typical early feature, and the behavioral changes in Parkinson's disease are usually associated with the later stages or due to medication effects, which makes it less consistent with the initial presentation. Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (Option D) (CJD) is a rapidly progressive neurodegenerative disorder caused by prions, characterized by rapidly progressing dementia, myoclonus, ataxia, and other neurological signs. While behavioral changes can occur, urinary incontinence and multiple falls are not typical presenting features of CJD.",

      },
      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: A) Diffuse axonal injury Explanation: Diffuse axonal injury (DAI) is a form of traumatic brain injury caused by a blunt force injury to the brain, often from high-speed motor vehicle accidents. Aetiology: Cause: High-speed accidents, where accelerating and decelerating forces cause shearing of axons in the white matter of the brain. Affected Areas: Primarily the corpus callosum, brainstem, and white matter tracts, especially at the junction of grey and white matter. Pathophysiology: Shearing forces disrupt neuronal connections, leading to brain dysfunction. Common Deficits: Affect frontal and temporal white matter, corpus callosum, and brainstem. Clinical Presentation: Diagnosis: Clinical diagnosis, typically with a GCS of less than 8 lasting over six hours. Symptoms: Mild: Headache, dizziness, nausea, and fatigue. Severe: Loss of consciousness, persistent vegetative state, potential long-term recovery for a few. Dysautonomia: Tachycardia, tachypnea, hyperthermia, abnormal muscle tone, and posturing. Evaluation: CT: Small punctate haemorrhages to white matter tracts. MRI: Investigation of choice Small areas of cerebral microbleeds at the grey-white matter junction, corpus callosum, or the brainstem. Treatment/Management: Goals: Prevent secondary injuries (e.g., hypoxia, hypotension, intracranial hypertension) and support recovery. Initial Treatment: Focus on stabilization, including resuscitation and prevention of complications like cerebral oedema and elevated ICP. ICP Monitoring: Recommended for GCS below 8 and for patients unable to be regularly evaluated neurologically. Anticonvulsants: Short-term use (7 days) to prevent early seizures. Emerging Therapies: Progesterone treatment shows promise but cannot be routinely recommended. Incorrect Options: Extensive subarachnoid haemorrhage (Option B) is a life-threatening condition due to the accumulation of blood between the arachnoid and pia mater. Hypoxic cerebral injury (Option C) refers to injury of the brain due to a lack of oxygen delivery enough to support metabolic needs.",

      "explanation": "Correct Answer: B) Transient ischaemic attack Explanation: Based on the given clinical presentation, the probable diagnosis in this case is Transient Ischaemic Attack (TIA). Transient Ischaemic Attack (TIA) Defined as a transient episode of neurologic dysfunction due to the focal brain, spinal cord, or retinal ischemia without acute infarction or tissue injury. A TIA typically lasts less than an hour, more often minutes. Usually resolves within 24 hours. Risk is highest in the first 48 hours following a transient ischemic attack. Etiology: Common risk factors for all TIA include diabetes, hypertension, age, smoking, obesity, alcoholism, unhealthy diet, psychosocial stress, and lack of regular physical activity. A previous history of stroke or TIA will increase substantially the subsequent risk of recurrent stroke or TIA. Pathophysiology: TIA subtypes, classified according to the pathophysiological mechanisms Large artery atherothrombosis (M/C): This may be intracranial or extracranial atherothrombosis. The mechanism may be a lack of blood flow distal to the site of arterial stenosis or an artery-to-artery embolism. Small vessel ischemic diseases: The underlying pathology is either lipohyalinosis or small vessel arteriolosclerosis. The commonest risk factor is hypertension, followed by diabetes and age. Cardiac embolism: A clot in the cardiac chamber, most commonly in the left atrium , is secondary to atrial fibrillation. Cryptogenic : This is usually a cortical pattern of ischemia without any identifiable large artery atherothrombosis or cardiac source of emboli. More recently it is often referred to as ESUS (embolic stroke of unknown source). Other uncommon causes such as arterial dissection or vasculitis.

Ischaemic stroke (Option C) involves a more prolonged disruption of blood flow to a specific area of the brain, leading to persistent neurological deficits that do not resolve within 24 hours. Diabetic neuropathy (Option D) is unlikely to cause transient weakness limited to one side of the body, as seen in this case. Reference: TIA",

Tremor physiology involves the alternating contraction of opposing muscle groups (agonist and antagonist) in a rhythmic pattern. (Statement 2 Ruled Out) Physiologic tremors are a normal phenomenon that can occur in healthy individuals, particularly during certain postures or actions. (Statement 4 Ruled Out) Statement 3 regarding essential tremor being uncommon and affecting 5% of the population is incorrect.

        "A": "Endothelial injury of vessel due to HTN",
        "B": "Muscle intimal elastic lamina layer defect",

        "D": "Adventitia defect"
      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: B) Muscle intimal elastic lamina layer defect Explanation: Berry aneurysms primarily develop due to disruption of the internal elastic lamina of cerebral blood vessels. The internal elastic lamina is a critical structural component that provides tensile strength and elasticity to blood vessels. When this layer is compromised, the vessel wall becomes weakened and less able to withstand normal hemodynamic stresses , leading to outward bulging and eventual aneurysm formation. Berry Aneurysm Definition Saccular outpouching of intracranial arterial wall Represents 90% of cerebral aneurysms Primary location: Circle of Willis Most common sites: Anterior communicating/anterior cerebral junction Posterior communicating/internal carotid junction Middle cerebral artery bifurcation Basilar apex Pathophysiological Mechanisms Structural Changes: Most important- Internal elastic lamina disruption Media layer thinning Adventitial layer remodeling Molecular Mechanisms: Inflammatory mediator activation Matrix metalloproteinase upregulation Vessel wall extracellular matrix degradation Hemodynamic Factors: Wall shear stress elevation Flow-related endothelial injury Intramural stress distribution alterations Histopathological Classification 1. Mycotic: Infectious arterial wall damage Distal vessel predilection Inflammatory cell infiltration 2. Arteriosclerotic: Intimal hyperplasia Media degeneration Elastic fiber fragmentation 3. Traumatic: Transmural disruption False lumen formation Adventitial hemorrhage Rupture Risk Stratification Morphological Criteria: Size >7mm: high risk Aspect ratio >1.6 Daughter sac presence Wall irregularity Hemodynamic Factors: Systolic BP >140 mmHg Flow pattern alterations Intrasaccular pressure gradients Genetic Markers: Collagen deficiency Elastic fiber abnormalities Matrix metalloproteinase polymorphisms Clinical Manifestations Subarachnoid Hemorrhage: Hunt-Hess grading scale correlation Fisher scale for CT findings Modified Rankin Scale outcomes Mass Effect: Cranial nerve compression syndromes Brainstem compression sequelae Hydrocephalus development Thromboembolic Events: Watershed infarction patterns Perforator occlusion syndromes Distal embolization phenomena Endothelial injury due to HTN (Option A) while hypertension can exacerbate aneurysm formation and increase rupture risk, it is not the primary underlying cause of berry aneurysms. Hypertension acts as a contributing factor rather than the initiating defect. Endothelial layer defect (Option C) although the endothelium can be involved in aneurysm progression, the primary defect occurs in the internal elastic lamina rather than the endothelial layer. The endothelial dysfunction is usually secondary to the underlying structural abnormality. Adventitia defect (Option D) the adventitial layer is the outer layer of blood vessels and is not the primary site of berry aneurysm formation. The key pathology begins in the internal elastic lamina and medial layer of the vessel wall.

      },
      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "recommended approach in this scenario is to continue treatment for another 2 years. The duration of seizure freedom required before considering discontinuation of antiepileptic drugs varies, but typically 2-5 years of seizure freedom is considered an appropriate period. Incorrect Option: Option a. Stop the treatment and follow up: This option is incorrect. The 16-year-old girl has been seizure-free for 6 months, but it does not necessarily mean that she can safely stop the treatment altogether. Stopping the treatment abruptly can increase the risk of seizure recurrence. Option b. Gradually taper the drug and stop treatment: This option is incorrect. While the girl has been seizure-free for 6 months, it is generally recommended to continue treatment for a longer period before considering tapering and stopping the antiepileptic drug. Gradual tapering of the drug under medical supervision may be considered later, but not at this stage. Option d. Continue lifelong treatment with antiepileptics: This option is incorrect. Lifelong treatment with antiepileptic drugs is not necessary in all cases. If the girl remains seizure-free for a prolonged period (usually 2-5 years), there may be an opportunity to gradually taper and discontinue the medication under medical supervision. Reference: .",

      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "in the CSF of a child with a suspected tuberculous meningitis, which is caused by the bacterium Mycobacterium tuberculosis. The history of TB in the sister raises the suspicion of an infectious etiology. Examination of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) reveals a high leukocyte count (up to 1000/ µ L), usually with a predominance of lymphocytes but sometimes with a predominance of neutrophils in the early stage; a protein content of 1–8 g/L (100–800 mg/dL); and a low glucose concentration. Incorrect Options: Option B - Lymphocytosis, high sugar and high protein: While lymphocytosis and high protein levels are expected in a CNS infection, high sugar levels (hyperglycorrhachia) are not typical. Viruses and certain bacteria tend to decrease CSF glucose levels due to increased consumption. Therefore, this option is less likely. Option C - Neutrophils, low sugar, and low protein: Neutrophils are a type of white blood cell associated with bacterial infections. The combination of low sugar and low protein levels is not characteristic of most CNS infections, as infections typically lead to increased protein levels due to the inflammatory response. This pattern is not consistent with the clinical presentation and history provided. Option D - Neutrophils, low sugar, and high protein: While neutrophils could be present in the CSF in cases of acute bacterial meningitis, the combination of low sugar and high protein levels is not typical. Acute bacterial infections tend to lower CSF glucose levels due to consumption, but they also lead to an increase in protein levels. This option does not match the expected pattern for the given clinical scenario.",

However, this is not a typical presentation of hypoglossal nerve injury. Option C - Falling of the tongue: Falling of the tongue is also incorrect, as this is a nonspecific symptom that could occur due to various reasons, including weakness or paralysis of the tongue muscles.

      "explanation": "symptoms—weakness, easy fatigability, double vision (diplopia), and drooping of the upper eyelids (ptosis)—along with normal deep tendon reflexes, suggest a diagnosis of myasthenia gravis . The pathogenesis of myasthenia gravis involves an autoimmune attack on the acetylcholine receptors at the neuromuscular junction. In myasthenia gravis, autoantibodies target and destroy acetylcholine receptors at the neuromuscular junction. This decreases the efficiency of synaptic transmission, leading to muscle weakness and fatigue, particularly after repeated use. Incorrect Options: Option A - Decreased acetylcholine release at the nerve endings: This option is incorrect. In myasthenia gravis, the primary defect lies in the postsynaptic membrane of the neuromuscular junction, where autoantibodies target and interfere with AChRs. Option B - Decreased myosin: This option is incorrect. Myosin is a protein involved in muscle contraction. Myasthenia gravis does not involve a decrease in myosin levels or dysfunction of myosin. Option C - Absence of troponin C: This option is incorrect. Troponin C is a component of the regulatory complex involved in muscle contraction. Its absence is not associated with myasthenia gravis.

Proprioception is mainly carried by the posterior column (dorsal column) of the spinal cord. Function: The posterior column tract (or dorsal column-medial lemniscus pathway) carries proprioceptive information, vibration sense, and fine touch. Damage to this tract results in loss of proprioception, causing a stomping gait as the patient relies on visual cues to know the position of their legs. When eyes are closed, the patient loses these cues, resulting in difficulty walking. Incorrect Options : Option A - Spinocerebellar tract Function: Carries unconscious proprioceptive information to the cerebellum to help coordinate movements. Damage to this tract results in ataxia, but it is usually characterized by uncoordinated movements rather than a stomping gait. The patient might not show increased difficulty with eyes closed compared to eyes open. Option C - Vestibulospinal tract Function: Involved in maintaining balance and posture by controlling the muscles of the trunk and limbs. Damage to this tract would result in balance issues, but the patient would not typically present with a stomping gait or show significant worsening with eyes closed. Option D - Rubrospinal tract Function: Involved in the fine control of limb movements, particularly the flexors. Reasoning: Lesions in this tract are rare and typically do not cause a stomping gait or the described difficulty in walking with eyes closed. They might cause more subtle motor deficits.

      "question": "In the sagittal section of the brain given below, if the coloured area is affected, which of the following is not seen?",
      "options": {
        "A": "Urinary incontinence",
        "B": "Gait apraxia",
        "C": "Perianal anesthesia",
        "D": "Fecal incontinence"
      },
      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "represents a lesion in the area of the cerebral cortex known as the precentral gyrus or primary motor cortex. This region is responsible for motor control and coordination. Perianal anesthesia: Perianal anesthesia refers to the loss of sensation around the anus. The precentral gyrus, which is primarily involved in motor function, is not directly responsible for sensory perception. Sensory information, including perianal sensation, is processed in the somatosensory cortex, which is located in the postcentral gyrus. Incorrect Options: Option A - Urinary incontinence: The precentral gyrus is involved in the control of voluntary movement, including the coordination of the muscles involved in urinary continence. Damage to this area can disrupt the normal control of urinary function, leading to urinary incontinence. Option B - Gait apraxia: The precentral gyrus is crucial for the initiation and coordination of voluntary movements, including walking. Therefore, damage to this area can result in gait apraxia. Option D - Fecal incontinence: The precentral gyrus is involved in the coordination of the muscles involved in maintaining bowel continence. Damage to this area can disrupt the normal control of bowel function, leading to fecal incontinence. Reference: Harrison's Principles of Internal Medicine, 21e",

      "question": "A 16-year-old girl, who is taking antiepileptics, has had a seizure-free period of 6 months. She has no family history of epilepsy. Her EEG is now normal and she has a normal neurological exam and intelligence. What would your advice be?",
      "options": {
        "A": "Stop the treatment and follow up",
        "B": "Gradually taper the drug and stop treatment",
        "C": "Continue treatment for another 2 years",
        "D": "Continue lifelong treatment with antiepileptics"
      },
      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "withdrawal: Complete medical control of seizures for 1-5 years. Single seizure type, with generalized seizures having a better prognosis that focal seizures. Normal neurologic examination, including intelligence No family history of epilepsy Normal EEG. The treatment needs to be continued for 2 years as the risk of seizure recurrence after a seizure free period is highest within first 2 years. Incorrect options: Option A - Stop the treatment and follow up: Stopping the treatment abruptly in a patient with a history of epilepsy, even after a seizure-free period, carries a risk of seizure recurrence. Option B - Gradually taper the drug and stop treatment: Tapering and stopping the drug immediately after a 6-month seizure-free period may increase the risk of seizure recurrence. Option D - Continue lifelong treatment with antiepileptics: Lifelong treatment with AEDs is not necessary in all cases of epilepsy. Reference: .",
