      },
      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: A) PTH Explanation: The parathyroid glands, located behind the thyroid, consist of four small glands that produce parathyroid hormone (PTH) , an 84-amino acid peptide. The calcium-sensing receptor (CaSR), a G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) regulates PTH secretion, which responds to changes in serum calcium levels. Functions of PTH: In response to low serum calcium: Increases calcium reabsorption and promotes phosphate excretion (phosphaturia) in renal tubules. Enhances osteoclastic activity, facilitating bone resorption, while also supporting bone formation. Stimulates the activation of vitamin D3, converting 25-hydroxyvitamin D to its active form, 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D. Significance of PTH: Hypoparathyroidism: PTH decreases, resulting in decreased calcium and increased phosphate levels in the blood (reduced phosphaturia). Hyperparathyroidism: PTH increases, leading to increased bone turnover or remodelling (SAP or serum alkaline phosphatase is the marker for bone turnover). Turnover or Remodelling\" data-author=\"NA\" data-hash=\"8555\" data-license=\"NA\" data-source=\"NA\" data-tags=\"April2025\" height=\"306\" src=\"https://image.prepladder.com/notes/MWNo6yWas90bCtCZLm161744291728.png\" width=\"309\" /> FGF-23 (Fibroblast growth factor 23) (Option B) is a phosphaturic hormone that suppresses parathyroid hormone (PTH). It regulates calcium and phosphate metabolism by reducing phosphate levels and increasing calcium levels in the blood, which can lead to nephrolithiasis. Vitamin D3 (Option C) promotes calcium absorption, bone mineralisation and tissue differentiation. Deficiency of this vitamin leads to hypocalcemia, rickets, and osteomalacia , while its excess can result in hypercalcemia. Calcitonin (Option D) is a peptide hormone secreted by the parafollicular C cells of the thyroid gland. It is a tumour marker in medullary thyroid carcinoma and can be used therapeutically for conditions such as osteoporosis and Paget’s disease of bone.",

      "explanation": "Correct Answer: C) Tetany Explanation: The scenario of constipation, abdominal pain, elevated calcium levels, increased bone turnover (indicated by elevated alkaline phosphatase), and decreased phosphate levels suggests Primary Hyperparathyroidism , where tetany is not observed; instead, it is typically seen in hypoparathyroidism. Primary Hyperparathyroidism: Cause: Autonomous secretion of PTH (most commonly due to parathyroid adenoma) Clinical features: Stones, bone, groans and psychiatric moans It is more common in the 3rd-5th decade of life. Renal features: Recurrent Nephrolithiasis (Stones), nephrocalcinosis (calcium deposition in the kidney), urinary tract obstruction, infection or renal failure. Skeletal system: Osteitis fibrosa cystica (Bones) Increased bone resorption by osteoclasts leads to fibrous replacement in the lacunae, leading to bone pain and tenderness. Gastrointestinal: Abdominal pain (groans) , constipation , nausea, vomiting. Psychiatric: Psychosis, depression, confusion . (Psychiatric moans) Cardiovascular system: Systolic arrest can occur in severe cases (calcium>15mg%). It is associated with MEN1 or MEN 2/2A syndrome. Tetany (Option C) is characterized by muscle spasms resulting from increased excitability of peripheral nerves due to serum calcium levels falling below 7 mg/dL, as seen in hypoparathyroidism.",

      "explanation": "Correct Answer: D) DiGeorge syndrome Explanation: The condition described, characterized by neuromuscular excitability, low calcium, low PTH, and elevated phosphate levels, is diagnosed as Hypoparathyroidism , which can be associated with DiGeorge syndrome . Causes and conditions associated with Hypoparathyroidism: Post-operative patients (total thyroidectomy): Removal of parathyroid glands during total thyroidectomy (papillary thyroid cancer) Reimplantation of the parathyroid gland is performed in the brachioradialis (preferred) or sternocleidomastoid muscles to prevent hypoparathyroidism. Autoimmune polyendocrine syndrome (Type 1): Also known as Autoimmune poly-endocrinopathy-candidiasis-ectodermal dystrophy (APECED) Autosomal recessive Chromosome 21 AIRE gene defect (loss of function mutation). DiGeorge Syndrome (Option D) Failure of development of the 3rd and 4th pharyngeal pouches Features - CATTCH-22 Deletion of chromosome 22q11 C ongenital heart disease A bnormal facial features - Low set ears and hypertelorism T hymus gland abnormalities or absence T racheo-esopahgeal fistulas C left platelet/lip H ypoparathyroidism and H ypocalcemia It is rarely caused by hemochromatosis or Wilson’s disease. Cushing’s syndrome (Option A) is characterised by excess cortisol, which leads to symptoms such as weight gain (moon facies), tiredness, muscle weakness, hypertension, mood swings, hirsutism, osteoporosis, and elevated blood sugar. It is not associated with hypocalcemia, low PTH, or neuromuscular excitability. McCune-Albright Syndrome (Option B) is a genetic disorder caused by an active mutation in a G protein (mosaic pattern). It involves bone abnormalities (fibrous dysplasia), skin pigmentation, and endocrine issues (e.g., precocious puberty). It does not typically affect the parathyroid glands or cause hypocalcemia. Turner syndrome (Option C) is a genetic disorder affecting females, characterised by a 45XO karyotype. It presents with short stature, a fish-like mouth, a high-arched palate, a webbed neck, a broad chest, and underdeveloped ovaries, leading to primary amenorrhea and infertility . It is not associated with parathyroid dysfunction or abnormal calcium and phosphate levels.",

      "explanation": "Correct Answer: D) MEN Type 2 Explanation: Multiple Endocrine Neoplasia (MEN) Type 2: It includes parathyroid adenoma, pheochromocytoma and medullary cell carcinoma of the thyroid . Recurrent kidney stones are due to Hypercalcemia caused by Primary hyperparathyroidism, and its elevated PTH causes increased gastric secretion, contributing to abdominal pain and peptic ulcers. Pheochromocytoma causes high blood pressure due to excessive secretion of catecholamines (epinephrine and norepinephrine) from the adrenal medulla. MEN is a group of genetic syndromes ( Autosomal Dominant ) characterized by the development of tumors in multiple endocrine glands. Diagnostic criteria for MEN is Clinical features of 2 or more associated tumors Notable Family history Confirmation by genetic analysis. Types of Multiple Endocrine Neoplasia MEN Type I MEN Type II MEN Type III MEN Type IV Cause Defect of chromosome 11q13 causing MEN 1 gene mutation Also called Wermer’s syndrome Defect of chr.10 leading to mutation of RET gene Also called Sipple’s syndrome Also called MEN II B , it is a variant of Type 2 MEN Defect of chr.12 causing CDKN1B gene Tumors Included Parathyroid adenoma (most common) It presents with primary hyperparathyroidism ( ↑ PTH and ↑ Ca) All the 4 glands can be included. Rx: Total/subtotal parathyroid resection Parathyroid adenoma ( most common, and calcium can be normal) Medullary carcinoma thyroid ( most common) Parathyroid adenoma ( Presents as hypercalcemia) Pancreatic adenoma Presents as Gastrinoma or Zollinger-Ellison syndrome This leads to peptic ulcer disease in the duodenum, which is the leading cause of death in this type. Pheochromocytoma . Pheochromocytoma (Most important criterion for both MEN 2 and MEN 3): Presents with elevated blood pressure. Pituitary adenoma: Prolactinoma Pituitary adenoma: Prolactinoma, causing amenorrhea and Infertility Medullary thyroid carcinoma Calcitonin is the tumor marker present Cold nodules are seen on the thyroid scan Metastasis can be traced with PET scan Visible neck mass, causing dysphagia Rx - Prophylactic thyroidectomy Reproductive tract tumors Testicular tumors Neuroendocrine tumor (Cervix) Associated conditions Angio I broma Collagenoma Adrenocortical tumor Carcinoid tumors/Argenta I noma Pheochromocytoma (only in 1%) Congenital aganglionosis, Hirschsprung disease Marfanoid habitus Medullated corneal nerve I bers Mucosal neuromas Megacolon and Multiple diverticulae Occasionally with Renal tumor Adrenal tumor Reference: Harrison’s principle of internal medicine, 21st edition, Page 2983 - 2990 Davidson’s Principles and Practice of Medicine, 24th Edition, Page 868, 869",

      "explanation": "Correct Answer: D) Hypoparathyroidism is a part of Type 1 APS Explanation: Hypoparathyroidism is a part of APS type 2 , which is a gene defect in the HLA complex and is known to be more common than type 1. APS is a group of disorders characterized by the simultaneous occurrence of multiple autoimmune conditions affecting the endocrine system, which are also associated with non-endocrine conditions. Autoimmune Polyendocrine Syndrome Type 1 Type 2 Onset is early Onset is late Rare condition Comparatively more common No sex differentiation Female > Male Chr.21, the AIRE gene is affected Due to gene defects in the HLA complex Endocrine conditions Addison’s disease Hypoparathyroidism Hypogonadism Graves’ disease or autoimmune thyroiditis Type 1 Diabetes mellitus Endocrine conditions: Similar to Type 1, but Hypoparathyroidism is not a part.

      "question": "A 28-year-old woman presents with complaints of irregular menstrual cycles and infertility & reports increased headaches and visual changes over the past few months. An MRI reveals a large pituitary tumor. Family history is significant for several relatives with breast and thyroid cancers. Which syndrome is most likely associated with her condition?",

        "A": "McCune-Albright Syndrome",
        "B": "Von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) Disease",
        "C": "Cowden Syndrome",
        "D": "Carney Complex"
      },
      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: C) Cowden Syndrome Explanation: The most likely diagnosis is Cowden Syndrome, characterized by a family history of breast and thyroid cancers and pituitary tumors. The patient's symptoms of irregular menstrual cycles, infertility, and the pituitary tumor on MRI are consistent with this syndrome. Cowden Syndrome: Caused by a PTEN gene mutation on chromosome 10 q23.31. Characterized by multiple hamartomas affecting the skin, mucous membranes, and organs, including the thyroid, and is associated with an increased risk of thyroid, breast, and pituitary tumors. Endocrine manifestations, such as prolactin-secreting pituitary adenomas, can lead to irregular menstrual cycles and infertility, necessitating regular monitoring for potential pituitary involvement. McCune-Albright Syndrome (MAS) (Option A) is caused by a postzygotic mutation in the GNAS1 gene and is characterized by a triad of: Polyostotic fibrous dysplasia Café-au-lait skin pigmentation Precocious puberty Endocrine abnormalities like hyperthyroidism and Cushing's syndrome can also occur due to adrenal tumors. Pituitary tumors, particularly somatotroph tumors leading to acromegaly, may develop. Von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) Disease (Option B) is an autosomal dominant disorder caused by a mutation in the VHL gene on chromosome 3. It is characterized by: Hemangioblastomas of the retina and CNS Cysts in multiple organs Renal cell carcinoma Pheochromocytomas Pancreatic islet cell tumors While pituitary tumors are less common, they may occur as part of broader endocrine dysfunction. Carney complex (CNC) (Option D) is caused by a mutation in the PRKAR1A gene on chromosome 17q . It is characterized by: Myxomas, particularly cardiac Spotty skin pigmentation Endocrine tumors, including adrenal tumors causing Cushing's syndrome About 10% of CNC patients may develop growth hormone-secreting pituitary adenomas, leading to acromegaly, making regular screening for pituitary tumors essential.
