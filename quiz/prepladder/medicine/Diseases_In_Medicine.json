      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: C) CD4:CD8 T-cell ratio in BAL < 3.5. Explanation: The patient's presentation of persistent cough, shortness of breath, bilateral hilar lymphadenopathy, and a skin rash resembling lupus pernio is consistent with sarcoidosis. This condition is characterized by granuloma formation in multiple organs. Sarcoidosis typically presents with an increased CD4:CD8 T-cell ratio in bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) , often greater than 3.5 , indicating a skewed immune response.

      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: B) Prednisolone 20–40 mg/day. Explanation: The patient is a 45 y/o woman with sarcoidosis, presenting with worsening pulmonary symptoms and erythema nodosum, indicating a severe form of the disease. Treatment is necessary to improve her quality of life and prevent complications. Glucocorticoids like prednisolone are the first-line treatment for sarcoidosis, particularly for worsening pulmonary symptoms. Treatment of Sarcoidosis: Indications for treatment: To prevent organ/life-threatening complications or to improve quality of life. No treatment: Asymptomatic cases or mild disease may not require therapy but need monitoring. Glucocorticoids: First-line treatment . Higher doses for neurosarcoidosis and lower for cutaneous sarcoidosis. Start with prednisolone (20–40 mg/day) for cases of hypercalcemia, pulmonary/renal impairment, and uveitis. Inhaled/Topical glucocorticoids: For mild lung or eye involvement to reduce systemic glucocorticoid use. Steroid-Sparing Agents: Methotrexate : Steroid-sparing agent , commonly used for lung and other systemic involvement (Option A) . Azathioprine : Used in place of methotrexate. Hydroxychloroquine/Chloroquine: Effective for skin lesions and less severe pulmonary disease. (Option D) Minocycline : This may be useful in cutaneous sarcoidosis. Biologic Agents: Infliximab : Improves lung function in chronic cases, effective due to its action on TNF (Option C) . Adalimumab : Effective in sarcoidosis when used in higher doses. Etanercept : Limited role; less effective compared to infliximab. Severe Disease: Methotrexate, azathioprine, and TNF- α inhibitors for extensive disease. Lung Transplantation: Considered in selected severe cases.

      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: B) Weakness is typically asymmetric, affecting distal muscles more than proximal. heliotrope rash on the eyelids and the V-sign on the anterior neck and chest, as shown in the image, are characteristic of dermatomyositis . The presence of dysphagia further supports this diagnosis. Dermatomyositis typically presents with symmetric proximal weakness rather than asymmetric distal weakness. Dermatomyositis is a rare inflammatory myopathy characterized by chronic muscle inflammation and weakness. A key feature is a skin rash that often precedes or accompanies the progressive muscle weakness. Clinical Features of Dermatomyositis Weakness : Symmetric, proximal greater than distal. Rash : Characteristic rashes include: Heliotrope rash: Erythematous eyelid discolouration with periorbital edema. Gottron sign: Erythematous rash over extensor surfaces (knuckles, elbows, knees, ankles). Gottron papules: Raised erythematous rash over knuckles. V-sign: Rash on sun-exposed anterior neck and chest. Shawl sign: Rash over the back of the neck and shoulders. Nail bed telangiectasias: Dilated capillaries at nail beds. (Option C ruled out) Subcutaneous calcium deposits. Weakness and rash can appear together or be separated by months. (Option A ruled out) Some patients may present with only a rash (amyopathic DM), while others may show mainly weakness.

      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: B) Anti-TIF1 antibodies are associated with a favourable prognosis. Explanation: The given clinical history is indicative of dermatomyositis . Histopathological findings of perifascicular atrophy in the muscle biopsy support the diagnosis. Anti-TIF1 antibodies are actually associated with an increased risk of cancer, making this statement false. They are not indicative of a favourable prognosis. Diagnosis of Dermatomyositis: Pathogenesis of DM: Traditionally attributed to antibody-mediated damage to endothelial cells, but newer evidence points to IFN-mediated pathways, with IFN- β being a key factor. Serum CK: Elevated, but if normal, serum aldolase may be increased in 10% of the cases. (Option A) Antinuclear Antibodies (ANA): Can be positive but are non-specific. Myositis-Specific Antibodies (MSA): Associated with distinct clinical features: Anti-MDA5: Linked to rash, ulcers, and interstitial lung disease (ILD). (Option D ruled out) Anti-TIF1: Associated with cancer risk. Anti-Mi-2: Highly specific , associated with a favourable prognosis and specific skin features. Electromyography (EMG): Shows myopathic changes such as polyphasic motor unit potentials, increased insertional activity, and early recruitment. MRI: Reveals muscle oedema and inflammation. Histopathology: Perifascicular atrophy: A characteristic finding in dermatomyositis (DM), where muscle fibres near the perimysium are atrophic. (Option C ruled out) MxA staining: Shows intense staining of perifascicular myofibers and capillaries, indicating type I interferon (IFN) involvement, likely IFN- β .

      "question": "A 45-year-old woman has 3 months of progressive proximal muscle weakness, difficulty climbing stairs, and elevated creatine kinase (CK) levels. EMG indicates inflammatory myopathy, and a muscle biopsy shows endomysial infiltration with CD8+ T cells. What is the most likely diagnosis?",

        "A": "Polymyositis",
        "B": "Antisynthetase syndrome",
        "C": "Dermatomyositis",
        "D": "Overlap syndrome"
      },
      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: A) Polymyositis Explanation: Polymyositis (PM) is characterized by symmetric, proximal muscle weakness, primarily affecting muscle groups closer to the centre of the body, such as the shoulders and hips, with elevated CK levels. The muscle biopsy showing endomysial infiltration with CD8+ T cells supports this diagnosis. The absence of skin involvement differentiates it from dermatomyositis. Polymyositis Clinical Features: Polymyositis (PM) presents with symmetric, proximal muscle weakness that worsens over weeks to months. PM can involve the heart, lungs, and joints and is associated with an increased risk of cancer, although likely less than dermatomyositis (DM). Laboratory Features: Creatine kinase (CK) levels always elevate in uncontrolled PM; normal CK suggests the inclusion body myositis. Electromyography (EMG) and muscle imaging can show abnormalities but are not specific to PM. Histopathology and Pathogenesis: PM shows varied muscle pathology, with nonspecific inflammatory cells found more often in the perimysium than in the endomysium. CD8+ T cells and macrophages are the primary inflammatory cells found in endomysial, perimysial, and perivascular regions. Antisynthetase Syndrome (Option B) Clinical Features: Antisynthetase syndrome (AS) involves myositis, non-erosive arthritis, interstitial lung disease (ILD), Raynaud’s phenomenon, mechanic’s hands, and fever. It is associated with antibodies against aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase, especially anti-Jo-1. Some patients may have an erythematous rash . Laboratory Features: Antibodies against aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase are the most common myositis-specific antibodies. Creatine kinase (CK) is usually elevated in AS with myositis. Patients with ILD show reduced forced vital capacity and diffusion capacity on pulmonary function tests. Skeletal muscle MRI and EMG show similar abnormalities to DM, PM, and immune-mediated necrotizing myopathy (IMNM). Muscle biopsies show features like DM , including macrophage deposition, muscle fibre necrosis, MHC-I staining, and capillary damage. Perifascicular muscle fiber atrophy and perimysial/perifascicular fragmentation are common, similar to DM. Dermatomyositis (Option C) presents with muscle weakness similar to PM but is associated with characteristic skin rashes such as Gottron’s papules and heliotrope rash, which are not present in this case. Overlap syndrome (Option D) involves myositis coexisting with another connective tissue disease, such as systemic lupus erythematosus or scleroderma. This patient’s presentation is isolated to muscle weakness, making overlap syndrome less likely.",

      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: A) Behçet's disease Explanation: The patient’s recurrent oral and genital ulcers, skin lesions (erythema nodosum), ocular involvement (anterior uveitis), and positive pathergy test are characteristic of Behçet’s disease. Behçet’s Disease Behçet’s disease is a vasculitis of unknown cause, targeting small arteries and venules. Clinical Features: Oral ulcers are universal, usually deep, multiple, and lasting 10-30 days. Genital ulcers occur in 60-80% of cases. Skin lesions include erythema nodosum, acneiform lesions, migratory thrombophlebitis, and vasculitis. Ocular involvement includes anterior/posterior uveitis or retinal vasculitis. Neurological involvement (5% of cases) mainly affects the brainstem, causing pyramidal signs, cranial nerve lesions, or hemiparesis. Diagnosis: Primarily clinical, with the pathergy test (pustule development after skin prick) being a characteristic diagnostic feature. Diagnostic criteria: Recurrent oral ulceration plus two of the following: recurrent genital ulceration, eye lesions, skin lesions, or a positive pathergy test. Management: Oral ulcers: Treated with topical glucocorticoids (e.g., prednisolone mouthwashes). Colchicine is effective for erythema nodosum and arthralgia. Thalidomide is effective for resistant oral and genital ulcers but is teratogenic and neurotoxic. Cogan Syndrome (Option B) The Cogan syndrome is an autoimmune disease involving inflammation of the inner ears and eyes, characterized by vestibule-auditory dysfunction and interstitial keratitis. Systemic involvement, such as aortitis leading to aortic insufficiency or heart failure, is present in 30-80% of cases. Overlap Syndrome (Option C) occurs when dermatomyositis (DM) or polymyositis (PM) coexists with other connective tissue diseases (CTDs), such as scleroderma, mixed connective tissue disease (MCTD), Sjögren’s syndrome, systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), or rheumatoid arthritis. Antisynthetase syndrome (Option D) is characterized by myositis, interstitial lung disease (ILD), arthritis, and \"mechanic’s hands,\" often associated with anti-Jo-1 antibodies. The absence of lung involvement or typical antisynthetase symptoms in this patient makes this diagnosis less likely.

      "explanation": "Correct answer: D) Recurrent anterior uveitis Explanation: The clinical presentation and the examination findings point to Ankylosing Spondylitis. Ankylosing Spondylitis - Clinical Features General Features Spine and Joint involvement Extra-articular manifestations Inflammatory back pain : Gradual onset, worse with inactivity, improves with movement and is often associated with early morning stiffness. Fatigue : A common and significant symptom. Postural changes : Loss of lumbar lordosis, increased thoracic kyphosis, and forward stooping of the neck. Enthesitis : Inflammation at tendon or ligament attachment sites, often mistaken for fibromyalgia. Peripheral joint involvement : Affects large joints like hips, knees , and shoulders and is usually asymmetrical. Sacroiliac joint involvement : B/L and asymmetrical; pain may radiate to the buttocks or posterior thighs. Reduced spinal mobility: Limited movement in the lumbar region due to inflammation and pain, often accompanied by muscle spasms. Anterior uveitis: Most common extra articular manifestation. Presents with sudden unilateral eye pain, redness, and light sensitivity, often preceding joint symptoms. (Option D) Anaemia, prostatitis, inflammatory bowel disease, aortic valve disease, and very rare cases of amyloidosis or upper lobe pulmonary fibrosis Osteoporosis : This can lead to vertebral fractures, especially with spinal fusion. High fever and night sweats (Option A): High fever and night sweats are more indicative of infectious diseases like tuberculosis or systemic inflammatory conditions such as lymphoma. In ankylosing spondylitis, systemic symptoms are usually mild and are generally limited to fatigue and occasional weight loss. Symmetrical small joint swelling (Option B): Symmetrical involvement of the small joints, particularly in the hands and wrists, is more characteristic of rheumatoid arthritis rather than ankylosing spondylitis. Generalized muscle weakness (Option C): It is not a feature associated with ankylosing spondylitis. The condition primarily affects the spine and joints rather than causing widespread muscle weakness.

      "explanation": "Correct answer: B) Loss of lumbar lordosis Explanation: The examination findings of limited chest expansion and restricted lumbar flexion on Modified Schober’s test point to Ankylosing Spondylitis . Loss of lumbar lordosis is a common postural change seen in ankylosing spondylitis. As the disease progresses, the normal inward curvature of the lower back diminishes due to chronic inflammation and spinal rigidity. Ankylosing Spondylitis - Physical Examination Tenderness: Common over the sacroiliac joints, spinous processes, and affected entheses. Reduced Spinal Mobility: Limited anterior, lateral flexion, and extension of the lumbar spine. Reduced chest expansion: Less than 2.5 cm is abnormal. Modified Schober’s Test: Reduced lumbar spine flexion, an increase of less than 2 cm suggests limited mobility. Postural Changes: Loss of lumbar lordosis , buttock atrophy, increased thoracic kyphosis, and possible forward neck stoop. Hip or shoulder Involvement: Pain or restricted movement in affected joints. Modified Schober’s Test Postural change Free lateral bending of the spine (Option A): In ankylosing spondylitis, lateral bending of the spine is often reduced or painful due to inflammation of the spinal joints. The stiffness limits the range of motion. Hypermobile cervical spine (Option C): Cervical spine involvement in ankylosing spondylitis results in stiffness and reduced mobility, rather than hypermobility. Over time, it can become rigid and contribute to postural changes. Absence of tenderness over the sacroiliac joints (Option D): Tenderness over the sacroiliac joints is a hallmark of ankylosing spondylitis, as these joints are frequently affected by inflammation.",

Inflammatory Markers : Elevated ESR and CRP levels may indicate active disease. Faecal Calprotectin : Helps screen for associated inflammatory bowel disease. Show characteristic changes in sacroiliac joints , such as: Blurred cortical margins Erosions and sclerosis \"Pseudowidening\" of joint space (early stages) Joint space narrowing and fusion (later stages) Bamboo spine - Vertebral body fusion by syndesmophytes Dagger sign - Calcification appears as a single radiodense line vertically running down the spine on frontal radiographs. Investigation of choice – more sensitive than X-rays for detecting early inflammatory changes. Can reveal bone marrow oedema, enthesitis, synovitis, and erosions. History of joint pain plus normal X-ray findings (Option A): While a history of joint pain can indicate many conditions, having normal X-ray results does not align with the diagnostic criteria for axial spondyloarthritis. HLA-B27 positivity plus a history of allergic rhinitis (Option B): While HLA-B27 positivity is important, a history of allergic rhinitis does not contribute to the diagnostic criteria for axial spondyloarthritis. Elevated CRP levels plus a positive Schober's test (Option D): Although elevated CRP levels indicate inflammation and a positive Schober's test suggests reduced spinal mobility, this combination does not meet the criteria for a definitive diagnosis. The criteria require spondyloarthritis features alongside HLA-B27 status or sacroiliitis on imaging.

Pharmacological Therapy Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory Drugs (NSAIDs) First-line treatment to treat pain and inflammation. Disease-Modifying Anti-Rheumatic Drugs (DMARDs) Sulfasalazine is used for peripheral arthritis Methotrexate is less effective in ankylosing spondylitis. TNF Inhibitors It reduces inflammation and is effective for both axial and peripheral symptoms. Examples: Infliximab, Etanercept, Adalimumab, Golimumab, Certolizumab Pegol. Adalimumab has been FDA-approved for managing uveitis . It can control both spinal symptoms and uveitis episodes in the patient. IL-17A Inhibitors Secukinumab Effective in patients who have not tolerated anti-TNF therapy Glucocorticoids Can be used in attacks of uveitis. Janus Kinase (JAK) Inhibitors Tofacitinib, Upadacitinib, and Filgotinib show efficacy in clinical trials. Anakinra (Option A): Anakinra is an IL-1 inhibitor that may be used for ankylosing spondylitis but is less effective than other biologics for both axial symptoms and uveitis. Sulfasalazine (Option C): While sulfasalazine can manage peripheral joint symptoms, it is not specifically indicated for uveitis treatment. Tofacitinib (Option D): Tofacitinib, a JAK inhibitor, has shown efficacy in ankylosing spondylitis but is not the first-line option for uveitis management.

      "explanation": "Correct answer: A) Lungs Explanation: Inflammatory pseudotumor (IPT) is a rare, benign condition identified by tumour-like masses of inflammatory cells. In children, inflammatory pseudotumor is most frequently found in the lungs, often presenting as a benign mass. It has an aggressive presentation in the sinonasal cavity and is the third most common orbital disease. It occurs rarely in the mediastinum, trachea, heart, brain, liver, spleen, biliary tree, gastrointestinal tract, mesentery, urinary bladder, kidneys and adrenals. Liver (Option B): Hepatic inflammatory pseudotumor is rare and is seen in adults. Brain (Option C): Inflammatory pseudotumor of the central nervous system is rare, especially in children. Kidneys (Option D): Renal involvement is uncommon for inflammatory pseudotumor.

        "D": "Storiform fibrosis"
      },
      "correct_answer": "D",
      "explanation": "Correct answer: D) Storiform fibrosis Explanation: Storiform fibrosis refers to a distinctive whorled or cartwheel-like pattern of collagen deposition and is commonly seen in IgG4-related inflammatory pseudotumor (IPT) . It is associated with fibroblastic and myofibroblastic proliferation, which gives rise to this unique arrangement. It also has lymphoplasmacytic infiltrate, where plasma cells show positivity for IgG4. Dense infiltrates and storiform fibrosis Inflammatory Pseudotumour - Clinical Manifestations General Symptoms : Mimics malignancy, leading to diagnostic challenges. Non-specific symptoms include fever, weight loss, growth retardation, thrombocytosis, iron deficiency anaemia, and hypergammaglobulinemia. Symptoms may arise from the mass effect on surrounding tissues. Organ-specific symptoms can have a variety of symptoms according to the particular organ. Lung: It can include cough, fever, shortness of breath, hemoptysis. Cardiac: Pallor, diaphoresis, syncope, transient ischemic attacks, arrhythmias. Orbital: Proptosis, ptosis, oculomotor deficits, diplopia, lid swelling, Gastrointestinal: Abdominal pain, jaundice, dysphagia, Genitourinary: Hematuria, dysuria, increased urinary frequency, flank pain and urinary tract obstruction. Epithelioid cell granulomas (Option A): These are generally found in sarcoidosis and are not characteristic of IgG4-related inflammatory pseudotumors. Caseating granulomas (Option B): These granulomas are associated with tuberculosis and certain fungal infections, not typically seen in IgG4-related conditions. Necrotising vasculitis (Option C): This refers to inflammation of blood vessels with necrosis, often seen in conditions like polyarteritis nodosa, rather than in IgG4-related diseases.",

Imaging reveals a \"sausage-shaped\" pancreas and a subsequent CT scan shows diffuse pancreatic enlargement. The patient's condition is suspected to be related to an inflammatory process rather than malignancy. Which of the following is the most appropriate first-line treatment for this condition?",

        "D": "Antibiotics"
      },
      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: C) Glucocorticoids Explanation: The patient mostly has a diagnosis of inflammatory pseudotumor which is supported by the \"sausage-shaped\" pancreatic enlargement on imaging, along with symptoms of abdominal pain, weight loss, and obstructive jaundice. The diagnosis of inflammatory pseudotumor is best managed with glucocorticoids. Inflammatory pseudotumour Imaging findings: CT-Abdomen with sausage-shaped pancreas Pancreas: Diffuse or segmental pancreatic enlargement (termed \"sausage-shaped pancreas\") with loss of normal lobularity; may mimic pancreatic adenocarcinoma, raising suspicion of malignancy. CXR showing growth in the Right upper lobe Lungs: Asymptomatic nodular or mass-like lesions; may present with paravertebral masses, central airway disease, or interstitial pneumonia, often associated with pleural thickening and effusion. Inflammatory pseudotumour Treatment: First-line therapy: Glucocorticoids Initial dose: Prednisone 40 mg/day Taper to 5 mg/day within 2-3 months The response is typically rapid, but long-term steroid-free remission is uncommon. Second-line therapy: Rituximab Used for relapsing or glucocorticoid-resistant disease. Dosing: Two 1 g IV doses, 15 days apart Benefits: Swift IgG4 reduction, impacts B and T cell functions Can be first-line in patients at high risk for steroid toxicity or organ-threatening disease Rituximab (Option A) : While effective for relapsing or glucocorticoid-resistant disease, it is not the first-line treatment and is typically used after glucocorticoids. Surgical resection (Option B) : Not indicated initially as the condition is inflammatory rather than malignant; observation and medical management are preferred first. Antibiotics (Option D) : These are not appropriate for inflammatory pseudotumor unless there is a concurrent infection, as this condition is not caused by bacterial infection.",
