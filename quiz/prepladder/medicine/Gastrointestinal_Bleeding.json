What is the most likely cause of this patient’s gastritis?",

      "explanation": "of peptic ulcers at the antrum on endoscopy, are most consistent with Type B gastritis . In this case, the underlying cause of the peptic ulcers is an infection with Helicobacter pylori. Type B Gastritis vs. Type A Gastritis: Feature Type B Gastritis Type A Gastritis Cause Primarily caused by H. pylori infection and long-term NSAID use Autoimmune condition, often associated with autoantibodies against parietal cells and intrinsic factor Location of Inflammation Antrum (lower part) of the stomach, near the pylorus Fundus (upper part) of the stomach, where parietal cells are found Symptoms Epigastric pain, bloating, nausea, vomiting, and ulceration in some cases. Often asymptomatic, but may cause symptoms like nausea, vomiting, and abdominal discomfort Associated Conditions Peptic ulcer disease (PUD), gastric cancer risk Pernicious anemia (due to vitamin B12 deficiency) Histological Findings Chronic inflammation, increased lymphocytes and neutrophils, often with atrophic changes Chronic inflammation, loss of parietal cells, and often atrophy of the gastric mucosa Risk Factors H. pylori infection, NSAIDs, alcohol, smoking Autoimmunity, genetic predisposition, vitamin B12 deficiency Treatment Eradication of H. pylori with antibiotics and proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) Vitamin B12 supplementation and immune modulation; PPIs may also be used Prognosis If untreated, it can lead to peptic ulcers and an increased risk of gastric cancer. If untreated, it can result in pernicious anemia and an increased risk of gastric carcinoma. Autoimmune destruction of parietal cells (Option A): This usually causes Type A gastritis, which is caused by an autoimmune process affecting the stomach’s parietal cells, often resulting in vitamin B12 deficiency. Chronic alcohol consumption alone (Option C): While alcohol can irritate the stomach lining and contribute to gastritis, it is less likely to be the sole cause of peptic ulcers in this patient. Stress-related mucosal injury (Option D): This type of gastritis is typically associated with severe physical stress, such as trauma, surgery, or burns. It does not align with this patient's chronicity or risk factors.",

      "correct_answer": "D",
      "explanation": "Correct answer: D) Granulomatous gastritis Explanation: Helicobacter pylori is a common cause of chronic gastritis and is typically associated with the following types: Antral predominant gastritis: Most common in early H. pylori infection, affecting the antrum of the stomach. Non-atrophic pangastritis: H. pylori can affect the entire stomach, but in the early stages, it usually does not cause atrophy. Corpus-predominant gastritis: It may develop as the infection progresses, often leading to atrophic changes in the stomach's corpus (body). However, granulomatous gastritis is not associated with Helicobacter pylori infection. It is more commonly seen in conditions like Crohn’s disease, sarcoidosis, or infections like tuberculosis. It is characterized by granuloma formation rather than the chronic inflammation typical of H. pylori-associated gastritis .

      "explanation": "Correct answer: A) Urea breath test Explanation: The above-described case scenario is a condition caused by H. pylori, and the urea breath test (UBT) is the most appropriate non-invasive test to confirm the eradication of H. pylori after treatment. Tests used to evaluate H.Pylori eradication Urea breath test (Option A) It is a simple, non-invasive, highly sensitive and specific test. It is ideally performed at least 4 weeks after the completion of therapy to avoid any false negatives due to the residual effects of antibiotics or PPIs. Stool antigen test It is also a noninvasive test, and to avoid false negatives, it needs to be performed after 4 weeks of treatment . Biopsy-based histology tests It can be done to evaluate the success of the treatment. It can only be performed after 2 weeks of stopping PPIs and 6 weeks of stopping antibiotics. It is not commonly preferred. H. pylori serology (Option B) is not a preferred test because this test detects antibodies against H. pylori and after treatment, it may remain positive even if the infection has been eradicated, making it unsuitable for confirming eradication. Upper GI endoscopy (Option C) is not routinely required to confirm H. pylori eradication as this procedure is invasive and is not indicated in this case unless there are other red flags or complications. Rapid urease test (Option D), is an invasive test which is useful for diagnosing active infection during an endoscopy and generally not needed for routine post-treatment confirmation of eradication.

      "explanation": "omeprazole or pantoprazole, as it helps to heal the ulcer, relieve pain, and promote faster mucosal recovery. They reduce gastric acid production by inhibiting the H+/K+ ATPase (proton pump) in the parietal cells. Management of NSAID induced gastric/ duodenal ulcer: Firstly, NSAID should be discontinued and they should be treated with PPIs or H2 receptor antagonists. In case of conditions where NSAID cannot be stopped, PPI is the drug of choice. For prophylactic management (in case of risk factors) Misoprostol Selective COX-2 inhibitor PPI is used Risk factors for NSAID-induced gastric/ duodenal ulcer: Advanced age History of PUD Concomitant use of Glucocorticoids High dose NSAIDs Multiple NSAIDs SSRIs Anticoagulants or Clopidogrel Concomitant Infection with H. pylori Cigarette Smoking Alcohol usage Misoprostol (Option A) is a prostaglandin analog that prevents NSAID-induced ulcers , hence used for prophylaxis. However, it is not the first-line treatment for active ulcers as it is less effective than PPIs in promoting ulcer healing. Sucralfate (Option B) is a cytoprotective agent that forms a protective barrier over the ulcer, but it is not as effective as PPIs in promoting ulcer healing. H2-receptor antagonists (Option D) reduce gastric acid secretion, and help in healing the gastric ulcer, however in the given condition as she is suffering from arthritis, she is likely to continue NSAIDs and H2-receptor antagonists is not preferred in this condition.
