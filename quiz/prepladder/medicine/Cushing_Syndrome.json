      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: B) Very low ACTH levels Explanation: ACTH levels are very high in Nelson syndrome Nelson syndrome/post-adrenalectomy syndrome: Definition Nelson's syndrome is a condition that typically occurs after bilateral adrenalectomy for the treatment of Cushing's disease (pituitary-dependent Cushing’s syndrome). The removal of the adrenal glands leads to a lack of negative feedback on the pituitary, resulting in increased secretion of ACTH . Over time, the pituitary gland may develop a pituitary adenoma (or enlargement of an existing adenoma), which secretes ACTH in excess. (Option C and D ruled out) Prevention Prophylactic radiation therapy may be indicated to prevent the development of Nelson’s syndrome after adrenalectomy Clinical features Hyperpigmentation Bitemporal hemianopia Progressive visual loss in cases of large tumors (Option A ruled out) Headache Weakness and fatigue Inhibition of the release of other pituitary hormones Evaluation Fasting Plasma ACTH Levels: Very high levels. (Option B) Diagnosis confirmed by an ACTH increase >30% of the initial result on three consecutive samples after bilateral adrenalectomy. Decreased levels of anterior pituitary hormones . Brain MRI shows pituitary tumors or enlargement of existing tumors. Screening: Regular screening with fasting plasma ACTH levels and brain MRI in patients after bilateral adrenalectomy.

        "D": "Pasireotide injection"
      },
      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: C) Selective transsphenoidal surgery Explanation: Selective transsphenoidal surgery is the preferred initial treatment for Cushing’s disease caused by a pituitary adenoma. Treatment and Management The approach to managing Cushing's syndrome depends on accurate diagnosis and identifying the underlying cause. Initial Steps of Workup Exclude exogenous glucocorticoid use as the source of symptoms. Conduct thorough clinical assessment and laboratory testing to confirm Cushing's syndrome. Determine whether the cortisol excess is ACTH-dependent or ACTH-independent using plasma ACTH levels. Perform appropriate imaging (pituitary MRI for ACTH-dependent, adrenal CT for ACTH-independent) to visualize potential tumors. Employ further tests like the dexamethasone suppression test, CRH test, and inferior petrosal sinus sampling (IPSS) to differentiate between Cushing's disease and ectopic ACTH syndrome. I) Surgery : The preferred treatment for most cases. Cushing's disease: Selective transsphenoidal surgery (Option C) to remove the pituitary adenoma, the preferred initial treatment for Cushing’s disease caused by a pituitary adenoma. Adrenocortical adenoma: Laparoscopic/ Open adrenalectomy, depending on size. Ectopic ACTH syndrome: Surgical removal of the ACTH-secreting tumor , if locatable. Bilateral Adrenalectomy: Considered in cases of ectopic ACTH syndrome where the tumor source cannot be located . Requires lifelong corticosteroid replacement. (Option B ruled out) II) Medical Therapy : Used to control cortisol levels pre-operatively or in cases where surgery is not feasible, like Refractory hyperkalemic hypertension, Acute psychosis, Undetected ectopic, Metastasis Metyrapone and ketoconazole (Option A ruled out) : Inhibit cortisol synthesis. Osilodrostat : A potent 11 β -hydroxylase inhibitor. Mitotane : An adrenolytic agent, often used for ACC. Etomidate : Blocks 11 β -hydroxylase, administered intravenously. Pasireotide : A somatostatin receptor agonist, used for Cushing's disease when surgery is not successful. (Option D ruled out) III) Post-Surgical Management: Hydrocortisone replacement is necessary after surgery to address HPA axis suppression. The recovery of the HPA axis can take months or even years, and in some cases, may not fully recover. IV) Long-term Monitoring: Essential to detect recurrence and manage potential complications.

      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: B) Osteoporosis Explanation Cushing's syndrome can be associated with bone resorption and reduced bone formation due to high levels of cortisol. Clinical Features of Cushing syndrome Physical : Weight gain and central obesity : Particularly around the face ( \"moon facies\" ) and the back of the neck ( \"buffalo hump\" ). Skin changes: Thin and fragile skin prone to bruising, broad purple stretch marks, acne, and hirsutism. Musculoskeletal Issues: Osteoporosis (leading to fractures, especially in the spine) (Option B) , muscle weakness, and proximal myopathy (difficulty climbing stairs or rising from a chair), decreased deep tendon reflexes (Option C ruled out) Metabolic : Glucose intolerance or diabetes and dyslipidemia (abnormal blood lipid levels). Cardiovascular : Hypertension (Option A ruled out) , hypokalemia , and edema. Reproductive: Decreased libido , and amenorrhea in women due to suppressed gonadotropin release. Psychological : Irritability, emotional instability, depression, cognitive impairment, and in severe cases, psychosis. Other features: Increased susceptibility to infections, elevated white blood cell count (Option D ruled out) , eosinopenia Hypercoagulable state, increasing the risk of deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism.

        "D": "Primary pigmented nodular adrenal disease (PPNAD)"
      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: B) Ectopic ACTH secretion Explanation: The presence of elevated ACTH levels and a lung mass strongly suggests ectopic ACTH production, which is often associated with neuroendocrine tumors such as small-cell lung carcinoma. These tumors secrete ACTH outside the normal hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis, causing hypercortisolism and Cushing's syndrome. Cushing's syndrome: Cushing's syndrome is a collection of symptoms resulting from prolonged exposure to high levels of glucocorticoids. Cushing's disease specifically refers to Cushing's syndrome caused by a pituitary corticotrope adenoma. It is relatively rare, but mild cases may be more common, particularly among those with symptoms like central obesity, type 2 diabetes and osteoporosis. Hyperpigmentation of knuckles: Central obesity with broad purple stretch marks: Causes: Cushing's syndrome can be caused by various factors, categorised as ACTH-dependent or ACTH-independent. I) ACTH-dependent Cushing's Syndrome accounts for approximately 90% of cases. Cushing's disease (ACTH-producing pituitary adenoma) is the most common cause. Ectopic ACTH syndrome occurs when a non-pituitary tumour secretes ACTH . II) ACTH-independent Cushing's Syndrome constitutes the remaining 10% of cases. Adrenocortical adenoma is the most prevalent cause, accounting for 5–10% of all cases. Rare causes include: Primary bilateral macronodular adrenal hyperplasia (PBMAH) Primary pigmented nodular adrenal disease (PPNAD) McCune-Albright syndrome",

      "question": "A patient with a history of neuroendocrine tumors (NETs) presents with symptoms of carcinoid syndrome, including frequent episodes of watery diarrhea and flushing. Which of the following is the most appropriate first-line treatment to control these symptoms, particularly diarrhea?",
      "options": {
        "A": "Loperamide",
        "B": "Telotristat ethyl",
        "C": "Somatostatin analogues",
        "D": "Antihistamines"
      },
      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: C) Somatostatin analogues Explanation : Somatostatin analogues are the first-line treatment for carcinoid syndrome. They work by inhibiting the secretion of serotonin and other hormones responsible for symptoms like diarrhea and flushing. Carcinoid Syndrome Carcinoid syndrome is caused by hormone secretion (mainly serotonin ) from neuroendocrine tumors (NETs). Commonly arises from NETs in the small intestine or appendix . The syndrome typically occurs when the tumor has metastasized to the liver or retroperitoneum, allowing the hormones to enter systemic circulation. Histamine and tachykinins (e.g., substance P) may also contribute to the syndrome. Common Symptoms Flushing: Sudden onset of an intense red or purplish color, especially on the upper body, neck, and face, often with a sensation of warmth. Diarrhea: Frequent watery stools, often over 10 times/day, significantly impacting daily life. Less Common Symptoms Wheezing or asthma-like symptoms Impaired cognitive function in advanced cases Pellagra-like skin lesions due to niacin deficiency (from tryptophan being used to produce serotonin instead of niacin). Management Somatostatin analogues : Mainstay treatment that mimics somatostatin , which inhibits hormone secretion (e.g., serotonin). Most NETs (around 90%) have somatostatin receptors and respond to these analogues. Telotristat ethyl : Blocks serotonin production; used as adjunctive therapy for patients who don't fully respond to somatostatin analogues. (Option B ruled out) Surgery: Considered for localized tumors but often not possible in patients with metastatic disease. Loperamide (Option A): It is a conventional antidiarrhoeal agent that slows intestinal motility. However, it is not the first-line treatment for carcinoid syndrome because it does not address the underlying cause, which is the excessive secretion of hormones like serotonin by the neuroendocrine tumor. Antihistamines (Option D): Antihistamines may be used in cases where histamine secretion contributes to symptoms, but they are not effective in controlling the serotonin-mediated diarrhea characteristic of carcinoid syndrome.

      "question": "A 35-year-old male presents to the emergency room with severe headaches, palpitations and profuse sweating. His blood pressure is measured at 180/110 mmHg. Initial biochemical testing shows elevated plasma metanephrines and catecholamines. An MRI reveals a mass in the extra-adrenal retroperitoneal area. Which of the following is the most appropriate initial management strategy to control his blood pressure before surgery?",
      "options": {
        "A": "Labetalol",
        "B": "Phenoxybenzamine",
        "C": "Nitroprusside infusion",
        "D": "Propranolol"
      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: B) Phenoxybenzamine Explanation: Phenoxybenzamine is the first-line agent for blood pressure control in patients with catecholamine-secreting tumors, such as pheochromocytomas or paragangliomas. A non-selective alpha-adrenergic blocker. It reduces vasoconstriction and prevents hypertensive crises by blocking alpha receptors. It is used preoperatively to stabilize blood pressure and avoid life-threatening complications during surgery. Paraganglioma Catecholamine-producing tumors from sympathetic or parasympathetic nervous systems. Can be sporadic or hereditary (25-33% linked to MEN 2, VHL syndromes). Location: Skull base and neck. Called pheochromocytomas if present in retroperitoneal, pelvic, and thoracic regions. Clinical Features Referred to as \" the great masquerader \" due to variable presentation. Common symptoms: Headaches, sweating, palpitations, tachycardia, hypertension, anxiety, panic attacks. Hypertension is the main sign (can lead to heart failure, pulmonary edema, arrhythmias, and intracranial hemorrhage). Rarely, hypotension may occur if epinephrine predominates. Diagnosis Biochemical testing: Plasma or urine-fractionated catecholamines/ metanephrines (most sensitive). Imaging: CT, MRI (T2-weighted, gadolinium for extra-adrenal), PET (68Ga-DOTATATE PET) for tumor localization. Genetic screening is advised for young-onset, multifocal, extra-adrenal, or metastatic tumors. Treatment Surgical removal: Adrenalectomy (partial or total); preserve adrenal cortex to avoid Addison’s disease. Medical management: Preoperative blood pressure control below 160/90 mmHg is essential. Alpha-adrenergic blockers : Phenoxybenzamine (non-selective, preferred) to prevent hypertensive crises; prazosin/ phentolamine for paroxysms; liberal salt and hydration to avoid orthostasis. Beta blockers : Added after alpha blockade. Other antihypertensives: Calcium channel blockers and ACE inhibitors. Intraoperative BP control with nitroprusside if necessary. Metastatic Paraganglioma: Treatment options include surgery, alpha-blockers, chemotherapy, radiotherapy, and nuclear medicine therapy (e.g., 131I-MIBG). Nitroprusside infusion (Option C): Nitroprusside can rapidly lower blood pressure, but it is typically used during intraoperative management when blood pressure fluctuations occur due to tumor manipulation. It is not suitable for pre-surgical preparation because it does not address the underlying catecholamine surge. Propranolol (Option D): Beta-blockers like propranolol should not be used alone in the initial management of pheochromocytomas or paragangliomas. Administering beta-blockers without prior alpha-blockade can precipitate a hypertensive crisis due to unopposed alpha-adrenergic activity. Labetalol (Option A): While labetalol has both alpha and beta-blocking properties, it is not the first choice in this scenario. Beta-blockers can cause unopposed",

Pheochromocytoma: Description Pheochromocytomas are rare tumors arising from chromaffin cells of the adrenal medulla. The clinical features result from excessive secretion of catecholamines. Etiopathogenesis These tumors can be benign or malignant and are frequently associated with familial syndromes like neurofibromatosis type 1, multiple endocrine neoplasia type II, and Von-Hippel Lindau disease. Catecholamines are produced in the chromaffin cells starting with the rate-limiting step of tyrosine hydroxylase (TH), regulating the conversion of tyrosine to dihydroxyphenylalanine (DOPA). Pheochromocytomas release these catecholamines in various patterns ranging from paroxysmal, continuous, and mixed patterns. Histopathology Histology of the lesion characteristically shows zellballen nests of chromaffin cells with strong positivity to chromogranin, synaptophysin, CD56, and focally to S100.

Pheochromocytoma: Description Pheochromocytomas are rare tumors arising from chromaffin cells of the adrenal medulla. The clinical features result from excessive secretion of catecholamines. Epidemiology Estimated to occur in 2 to 8 of 1 million persons per year. The mean age at diagnosis is 40 years, although the tumours can occur from early childhood until late in life. The classic ‘rule of tens’ is 10% bilateral, 10% extra-adrenal (Paragangliomas), and 10% metastatic. It is not used nowadays.

      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: C) Low ACTH levels in secondary Addison's Explanation: In secondary Addison's disease, the problem lies with the pituitary gland , leading to low levels of ACTH (adrenocorticotropic hormone). Secondary or Central Addison disease Commonly occurs due to exogenous steroid administration, resulting in the suppression of ACTH synthesis. Secondary adrenal insufficiency is a pituitary-dependent loss of ACTH secretion, which reduces glucocorticoid production. Causes: Sheehan syndrome - M/C Obstetric cause Simmonds disease or pituitary cachexia Pituitary disorders (tumours, surgery, radiation). Long-term corticosteroid use leads to suppression of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis. Pituitary irradiation Pituitary haemorrhage Pituitary infiltration Symptoms : Fatigue, weakness, weight loss, nausea, vomiting, hypotension. No skin hyperpigmentation, unlike primary Addison's Alabaster coloured pale skin due to deficiency of POMC-derived peptides. Diagnosis : Administration of cosyntropin(ACTH) to assess adrenal function: Low cortisol with low-normal ACTH. ACTH stimulation test shows a blunted cortisol response. Normal renin Normal aldosterone mL Treatment : Glucocorticoid replacement (hydrocortisone or prednisone). Hydrocortisone of 15-25mg in 2-3 divided doses. Treat the underlying pituitary cause if present. High renin levels in secondary Addison's (Option A): Renin is usually normal; high renin occurs in primary Addison's. Low aldosterone levels in secondary Addison's (Option B): Aldosterone is normal in secondary Addison's; low in primary. Elevated potassium in secondary Addison's (Option D): Potassium is typically normal in secondary; elevated in primary.

      },
      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: A) Metabolic alkalosis Explanation: Hyperaldosteronism often causes metabolic alkalosis due to excessive hydrogen ion loss in the kidneys as aldosterone promotes sodium reabsorption and hydrogen ion excretion. This leads to an alkalotic state, which is consistent with the elevated aldosterone levels and clinical presentation in this patient. Clinical Features of Hyperaldosteronism Hypertension : Hallmark of hyperaldosteronism, often resistant to conventional treatments. Aldosterone's sodium-retaining effects lead to increased fluid volume and blood pressure. (Option C ruled out) Hypokalemia : Excessive aldosterone promotes potassium excretion in the kidneys, resulting in hypokalemia. This can manifest as muscle weakness, even paralysis. Notably, not all patients with primary aldosteronism exhibit hypokalemia. Metabolic Alkalosis: Aldosterone promotes hydrogen ion excretion and bicarbonate retention , contributing to metabolic alkalosis. Symptoms may include muscle cramps and tetany i n severe cases. (Option A) Other Features: Hyperaldosteronism is also associated with increased risks of: Cardiovascular disease Kidney damage Osteoporosis Type 2 diabetes Cognitive dysfunction Hypernatremia (Option B): While aldosterone increases sodium reabsorption, it usually does not cause hypernatremia due to a compensatory increase in water retention through other mechanisms, such as antidiuretic hormone (ADH) activity. Thus, serum sodium levels often remain normal. Increased plasma renin activity (Option D): In primary hyperaldosteronism, plasma renin activity is typically suppressed due to negative feedback from elevated aldosterone levels. Elevated renin activity would be more suggestive of secondary hyperaldosteronism or other causes of hypertension.

      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: C) Familial hyperaldosteronism type II (FH-II) Explanation : Familial hyperaldosteronism type II (FH-II) is associated with mutations such as KCNJ5, which affects the function of potassium channels and leads to excess aldosterone secretion. Patients with FH-II present with primary hyperaldosteronism (persistent hypertension, hypokalemia, and elevated aldosterone levels). The presence of the KCNJ5 mutation confirms Familial hyperaldosteronism type II (FH-II) in this patient. Primary Hyperaldosteronism Adrenal abnormalities: Arises due to dysfunction within the adrenal glands. Aldosterone-producing adenomas (APAs) : Benign tumors that account for about 60% of cases . These adenomas often contain somatic mutations (e.g., KCNJ5, ATP1A1, ATP2B3), which stimulate aldosterone synthase (CYP11B2) Idiopathic hyperaldosteronism (IHA) : Bilateral adrenal hyperplasia is responsible for around 40% of cases. Primary (Unilateral) Adrenal Hyperplasia (PAH): It typically lacks genetic mutations such as KCNJ5 , which is linked to familial hyperaldosteronism type II (FH-II). (Option A ruled out) Adrenal carcinoma: A rare cause that involves autonomous overproduction of aldosterone and/or deoxycorticosterone (DOC). Genetic Causes : Familial Hyperaldosteronism Type I (FH-I): Also known as glucocorticoid-remediable aldosteronism (GRA). A genetic fusion on chromosome 8 makes aldosterone synthesis ACTH-dependent. It is treatable with glucocorticoids. (Option B ruled out) Familial Hyperaldosteronism Type II (FH-II) and III (FH-III): Linked to mutations (e.g., KCNJ5), leading to increased aldosterone secretion via increased sodium permeability. (Option C) Secondary Hyperaldosteronism Causes: Triggered by conditions activating the renin-angiotensin system , which increases aldosterone production.

      "explanation": "Correct Answer: C) Adrenaline Explanation : The adrenal medulla secretes catecholamines such as adrenaline (epinephrine) and noradrenaline (norepinephrine). Epinephrine is 80%, 18 % norepinephrine and 2 % dopamine A mass in the adrenal medulla, such as a pheochromocytoma , can cause excessive secretion of these hormones, leading to episodic hypertension, palpitations, and sweating, as seen in this patient. Aldosterone (Option A) : Aldosterone is produced by the zona glomerulosa of the adrenal cortex, not the adrenal medulla. It regulates sodium and potassium balance. Cortisol (Option B): Cortisol is produced by the zona fasciculata of the adrenal cortex. Excess cortisol would lead to symptoms such as weight gain, muscle weakness, and hyperglycemia, which are not the primary symptoms in this patient. Androgens (Option D): Androgens are produced mainly by the zona reticularis of the adrenal cortex, not the medulla. Excess androgens may cause virilization but would not lead to the severe hypertensive episodes and catecholamine elevation described in this patient.
