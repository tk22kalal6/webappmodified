        "B": "0.8 g",
        "C": "1 g",

      "correct_answer": "D",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: D) 2 g Explanation: In patients with possible glomerular disease, Urine dipstick shows 2+ to 3+ proteinuria, with a significant level of > 1 g of protein in 24 hours. Urine Dipstick test Significance It is a rapid and cost-effective tool for screening and monitoring various urinary abnormalities, aiding in the early detection of kidney and systemic diseases. Disadvantages Paraproteins (+ve charged protein) like Bence Jones proteins are missed in dipstick. The dipstick primarily detects albumin (a - ve charged protein), the most common urine protein, and may also identify other proteins, but in smaller amounts. Results can be affected by factors such as urine pH, concentration, and temperature , leading to inconsistent readings.

      "question": "A 62-year-old man presents with fatigue, weight loss, and recurrent infections. Laboratory tests reveal anaemia and a serum immunofixation shows a monoclonal band. Which of the following tests helps identify proteinuria in this condition?",
      "options": {
        "A": "24-hour urine protein quantification",

      },
      "correct_answer": "D",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: D) Urine electrophoresis Explanation: This case is consistent with multiple myeloma, with the detection of a monoclonal band on serum immunofixation indicating the presence of paraproteins. Urine electrophoresis is the most effective method to identify paraproteins in the urine. Serum protein electrophoresis > Urinary Protein Electrophoresis: Shows the presence of M-Spike (Monoclonal Antibodies). Electrophoresis - Normal Electrophoresis - Multiple Myeloma Paraproteins: Definition: Paraproteins, also known as monoclonal proteins , are abnormal immunoglobulins produced by a clone of plasma cells. Their excess production, often associated with haematological disorders like multiple myeloma, leads to their detection in blood and urine. Seen in: Multiple Myeloma (Bence-Jones proteins) Monoclonal gammopathy of uncertain signi I cance (MGUS) Waldenström macroglobulinemia Lymphoplasmacytic Lymphoma Investigation of choice: 24-hour urine protein electrophoresis and Immunofixation. It helps in identifying excess free light chains in urine (paraprotein) 24-Hour Urine protein quantification (Option A) : Although this test measures total protein excretion, it may miss intermittent excretion of paraproteins and does not differentiate between types of proteins present. Urine Dipstick (Option B) is less sensitive in detecting positively charged proteins like paraproteins and can show false negative proteinuria; hence, it is not preferred in these conditions. Urine microscopy (Option C) focuses on examining cells, casts, and crystals in the urine rather than quantifying or identifying specific proteins, which is not useful in this condition.",

      "correct_answer": "D",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: D) Early stages of diabetes mellitus Explanation: The lab results indicate moderately increased albuminuria, which may indicate early stages of diabetes mellitus , while other conditions are associated with severely increased albuminuria.

      },
      "correct_answer": "D",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: D) Lipoid nephrosis Explanation: The labs show a nephrotic range of proteinuria, i.e., >3.5 g over 24 hours, and proteinuria of 3+ to 4+ in Dipstick analysis. Considering the patient's age, the more likely cause of Nephrotic changes can be Lipoid nephrosis , also called minimal change disease, which involves reversible damage to podocytes in the glomerulus. It is commonly observed in children but can also occur, though rarely, in adults. Causes of Nephrotic range Proteinuria Diabetic nephropathy Minimal change disease Membranous glomerulopathy IgA nephropathy Amyloidosis Focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS) Diabetic Nephropathy (Option A) is unlikely in this scenario because it is rare in children. Additionally, a significant history of diabetes mellitus is necessary for the development of diabetic nephropathy. IgA nephropathy (Option B) is caused by an abnormal immune response following infection, resulting in IgA antibody deposition in the glomeruli. This leads to hematuria and proteinuria and in severe cases, can progress to nephrotic syndrome. Membranous nephropathy (Option C) is rare in children but is the most common cause of nephrotic syndrome in adults . It is often idiopathic (primary) but can also be secondary to infections, cancer, certain drugs (e.g., NSAIDs), autoimmune diseases, or metal poisoning.d Disease Associations Serologic Tests Minimal Change Allergy, atopy, NSAIDs, Hodgkin’s None Focal Sclerosing Glomerulosclerosis African Americans, HIV, Heroin HIV Ab Membranous Drugs: gold, penicillamine, NSAIDs, Lupus Nephritis, Malignancy: breast, lung, GI Hep B surface antigen, Hep C antibody, Anti-DNA Ab Membranoproliferative GN Type I C4 Nephritic factor C3 ↓ , C4 ↓ Membranoproliferative GN Type II C3 Nephritic factor C3 ↓ , C4 normal Cryoglobulinemic MPGN Hepatitis C Anti-HCV antibody, rheumatoid factor, C3 ↓ , C4 ↓ , CH 50 ↓ Amyloidosis Myeloma, Rheumatoid arthritis, bronchiectasis, Crohn’s disease, FMF SPEP, UPEP Diabetic Nephropathy Other diabetic microangiopathy None Reference: Davidson’s Principles and Practice of Medicine, 24th Edition, Page 398, 400, Harrison’s Principles of Internal Medicine, 21st Edition, Volume I, Page 336.",

      "question": "A 30-year-old male, recovering post-operatively after ACL surgery, develops a fever, nausea, and cough. A urine dipstick reveals trace proteinuria. He has no history of hypertension or diabetes. What is the most likely cause of his proteinuria?",

      },
      "correct_answer": "D",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: D) Functional proteinuria Explanation: In this case, the most likely cause of proteinuria is functional proteinuria or transient proteinuria, which occurs in acute stressors like fever, urinary tract infection, surgery, exercise, or emotional stress. In this post-operative patient with a recent fever and no history of hypertension or diabetes, or renal pathology, functional proteinuria is the most probable cause. It is typically transient and mild, often resolving with the resolution of the stressor. Type of Proteinuria Causes Transient Fever, Stress, Dehydration, Cold exposure Orthostatic Subtle glomerular abnormality, Exaggerated hemodynamic response Persistent Diabetes, Lupus, Renal disease Post-renal UTIs, Nephrolithiasis Tubular Wilson Disease, Cystinosis, Nephrotoxic medicines, Interstitial nephritis, Acute Tubular Necrosis (ATN) Glomerular Glomerular basement membrane damage, Minimal change disease, IgA Nephropathy Overflow Multiple myeloma, Rhabdomyolysis Tubular proteinuria (Option A) occurs due to impaired reabsorption of low-molecular-weight proteins by damaged renal tubules, indicating tubular dysfunction. It is seen in conditions like acute tubular necrosis , tubulointerstitial nephritis , and certain genetic disorders affecting the proximal tubules. Glomerular Proteinuria (Option B) involves the excretion of high-molecular-weight proteins, primarily albumin, due to damage or dysfunction of the glomerular filtration barrier. It is commonly associated with conditions like nephrotic syndrome, glomerulonephritis, and immune interstitial nephritis. Overload proteinuria (Option C) results from an excessive amount of proteins in the bloodstream that overwhelms the kidneys' ability to reabsorb them, leading to their excretion without direct renal damage. It is commonly seen in conditions like multiple myeloma, hemoglobinuria, and myoglobinuria.

Normal Finding (Option A) Is the presence of less than 3 RBCs/HPF Isolated hematuria Presence of hematuria alone without any other casts, cells or proteinuria. Seen in urinary tract bleeding. Gross Hematuria (Option C) Presence of red blood cells in the urine that is visible to the naked eye causes the urine to appear red, brown or pink. Examples: Benign prostate hyperplasia, Kidney stones False positive hematuria Dipstick can be found positive for hematuria in the case of myoglobinuria. Examples: Rhabdomyolysis Medications can cause hematuria or urinary discoloration due to pseudohematuria (ie, red, pink, or brown urine discoloration), kidney damage, nephrolithiasis or urolithiasis, or hemorrhagic cystitis. Medications that can lead to hematuria include (Option D): Allopurinol Blood thinners, such as warfarin or antiplatelet drugs Cephalosporins Hydralazine Nitrofurantoin Penicillin Rifampin Sulfa drugs Drug induced hematuria often resolves when the offending drug is discontinued, which is not noted in this scenario. Moreover, the patient experienced hematuria even before receiving any medications, making this an unlikely option.
