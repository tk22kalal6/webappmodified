      "question": "During the discharge of a COVID patient who was treated with steroids and remdesivir, which of the following will you inform him about? Repeat RT-PCR after 7 days of discharge Watch for the persistence of Anosmia Watch for headache and nasal discharge Monitor glucose levels Watch for Sinusitis like symptoms",
      "options": {
        "A": "1, 3 and 4",
        "B": "2, 3 and 4",
        "C": "3, 4 and 5",
        "D": "1,2,3,4 and 5"
      },
      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer C - 3, 4 and 5 Patients treated with steroids and remdesivir for COVID-19 require careful monitoring during discharge. It is crucial to monitor glucose levels (4) because steroids can cause hyperglycemia. Additionally, watching for sinusitis-like symptoms (5) , including headache and nasal discharge (3) , is important due to the increased incidence of mucormycosis in COVID-19 patients. Revised Discharge Policy for COVID-19: Mild Cases of COVID-19: Discharge criteria: At least 7 days have passed since testing positive. No fever for 3 successive days. No testing is required prior to discharge. Moderate Cases Admitted to Dedicated COVID Health Centre Patients with resolved signs/symptoms and saturation >93% for 3 successive days: Discharge after resolution of symptoms and maintaining saturation above 93% for 3 successive days (without oxygen support). Stable comorbidities, if any, are required. No testing is required prior to discharge. Patients on oxygen with unresolved signs/symptoms and ongoing oxygen therapy demand: Discharge only after the following criteria are met: Resolution of clinical symptoms. Ability to maintain prescribed oxygen saturation for 3 successive days without oxygen support. Stable comorbidities, if any. Severe Cases, Including Immunocompromised Patients (HIV, transplant recipients, malignancy, etc.) Discharge will be based on clinical recovery. The decision is at the discretion of the treating medical officer. Repeat RT-PCR after 7 days of discharge (Option 1): This is not recommended under the updated COVID-19 discharge criteria. Watch for persistence of anosmia (Option 2): Anosmia is a common post-COVID symptom that may persist for weeks to months in recovered patients. It is not considered a dangerous sign and does not require active monitoring during the discharge period.

      "question": "A woman with hysteria who was hyperventilating developed carpo-pedal spasms. What could be the likely cause for this?",
      "options": {
        "A": "Respiratory acidosis",
        "B": "Metabolic acidosis",
        "C": "Respiratory alkalosis",
        "D": "Metabolic alkalosis"
      },
      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: C) Respiratory alkalosis Explanation: The clinical features of hyperventilation leading to carpal spasm are caused due to respiratory alkalosis . Respiratory alkalosis occurs when there is a decrease in carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) levels in the blood, leading to an increase in alkalinity . Hyperventilation causes excessive elimination of carbon dioxide, leading to decreased blood CO 2 levels. This results in respiratory alkalosis Clinical features of respiratory alkalosis will include: Tachypnea Symptoms of hypocapnia Paresthesias from decreased ionized calcium due to alkalemia Reduced cerebral blood flow from hypocapnia Decreased ionized calcium causing tetany/carpopedal spasms Respiratory alkalosis- Clinical Features & Management Category Features Cause Neurological Dizziness Mental confusion Paresthesias Circumoral numbness Seizures (severe cases) Due to reduced cerebral blood flow From rapid ↓ PaCO 2 May occur without hypoxemia Cardiovascular Chest tightness/pain Palpitations Arrhythmias Possible ECG changes Due to coronary vasoconstriction ↓ ionized calcium effects Bohr effect on O 2 delivery Neuromuscular Carpopedal spasms Tetany Muscle twitching Weakness From ↓ ionized calcium Enhanced nerve excitability Similar to hypocalcemia Laboratory ↑ pH ↓ PaCO 2 ↓ Ionized calcium ↓ K+, ↓ PO 4 Acute: ↓ HCO 3 - by 2 mEq/L per 10 mmHg ↓ PaCO 2 Chronic: ↓ HCO 3 - by 4-5 mEq/L per 10 mmHg ↓ PaCO 2 Electrolyte shifts into cells Management Underlying Disease: Treat primary condition Address anxiety if present Manage sepsis if present Hyperventilation Syndrome: Reassurance Rebreathing techniques Paper bag breathing if needed β -blockers if needed Primary focus on the underlying cause Avoid sedatives for anxiety Monitor during mechanical ventilation Adjust ventilator settings if needed Regular monitoring of blood gases Address psychological factors Incorrect Options: Respiratory acidosis (Option A) results from impaired ventilation due to pulmonary disease, respiratory muscle fatigue, or abnormalities in ventilatory control. Some examples of these are drugs, alcohol, motor neuron diseases, skeletal muscle disease, etc. Metabolic acidosis (Option B) is caused by methanol, uremia, diabetic ketoacidosis, iron tablets, isoniazid, etc and not by hyperventilation. Metabolic alkalosis (Option D) is caused by exogenous bicarbonate loads, hypertension, K + deficiency, mineralocorticoid excess, etc. Reference: Harrison’s Principles of Internal Medicine, 21st Edition, Page: 368.",

      "question": "A diabetic woman is admitted due to persistent vomiting. She gives a history of consuming food from outside. On evaluation, her blood pressure is 90/60 mmHg. Her arterial blood gas (ABG) report shows the following findings. What is the cause of her ABG findings? pH - 7.52 HCO 3 - 30 meq/L PaCO 2 - 20 mmHg Na- 123 mEq/L K- 3.2 mEq/L CI- 67 mEq/L",

        "D": "Renal tubular acidosis"
      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: B) Persistent vomiting Explanation: The arterial blood gas shows an elevated pH (7.52) and increased bicarbonate (30 meq/L), indicating metabolic alkalosis . Hypochloremia and hypokalemia further support this diagnosis. The cause of this in the given scenario is persistent vomiting (hypochloremia). Metabolic Alkalosis Metabolic alkalosis is characterized by an increase in arterial pH , elevated serum bicarbonate [HCO 3 − ], and increased PaCO 2 I due to compensatory hypoventilation. Often presents with hypochloremia and hypokalemia . Occurs as a mixed disorder with respiratory or metabolic acidosis or alkalosis. Causes Exogenous Bicarbonate Loads Acute alkali administration Milk-alkali syndrome Effective ECFV Contraction (Normotension, K + Deficiency, Secondary Hyperreninemic Hyperaldosteronism) Gastrointestinal Origin: Vomiting, gastric aspiration, congenital chloridorrhea, gastro cystoplasty, villous adenoma Renal Origin: Diuretic use (thiazides, loop diuretics), post hypercapnic state, hypercalcemia/hypoparathyroidism, recovery from acidosis, non-resorbable anions (e.g., penicillin), Mg² I deficiency, K I depletion, Bartter's syndrome, Gitelman's syndrome ECFV Expansion, Hypertension, K+ Deficiency, and Mineralocorticoid Excess High Renin: Renal artery stenosis, accelerated hypertension, renin-secreting tumour, estrogen therapy Low Renin: Primary aldosteronism (adenoma, hyperplasia, carcinoma), adrenal enzyme defects (11 β -hydroxylase, 17 α -hydroxylase deficiency), Cushing’s syndrome, substances like liquorice, carbenoxolone Genetic Sodium Channel Mutation (Liddle's Syndrome) A gain-of-function mutation in the distal convoluted tubule, causing ECFV expansion, hypertension, K I deficiency, and hypo-reninemic-hypoaldosteronism Clinical Features Neurological: Mental confusion, obtundation, potential seizures Peripheral Nervous System: Paresthesias, muscle cramps, tetany (similar to hypocalcemia effects) Cardiovascular: Aggravation of arrhythmias, particularly in COPD patients Electrolyte Imbalances Potassium (K I ): Hypokalemia, especially in cases involving secondary hyperaldosteronism or diuretic use. Chloride (Cl I ): Hypochloremia, frequently accompanying alkalosis, especially in cases of vomiting or diuretic use. Calcium (Ca² I ): Symptoms may mimic hypocalcemia despite normal levels. Incorrect Options: Diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) (Option A) is a serious complication of diabetes characterized by high blood sugar levels, increased body ketone concentration, and metabolic acidosis. Septic shock (Option C) can lead to multiple organ dysfunction and a state of metabolic acidosis. The pH of 7.52 in the ABG report suggests alkalosis rather than acidosis, so septic shock is unlikely to be the cause. Renal tubular acidosis (RTA) (Option D) is a condition characterized by a defect in the kidneys’ ability to excrete acid, leading to a buildup of acid in the body. Since the ABG report shows alkalosis with a pH of 7.52, RTA is not the likely cause.",

      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: A) pH-7.14, pCO2-20 mmHg, HCO3- 5 mEq/L Explanation: The low pH and HCO 3 levels in the blood show metabolic acidosis . Metabolic acidosis Definition Primary decrease in HCO 3 I or increase in H I ions Characterized by ↓ pH and ↓ HCO 3 I Compensatory mechanism: ↓ PaCO 2 through hyperventilation (Kussmaul breathing) Types High anion gap (AG > 12 mEq/L) Normal anion gap (AG 6-12 mEq/L) Causes (Mnemonic: MUDPILES) M : Methanol U : Uremia (Renal failure) D : Diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) P : Paraldehyde, Phenformin, Propylene glycol I : Iron tablets, Isoniazid L : Lactic acidosis E : Ethylene glycol S : Salicylates (late phase) (Mnemonic: HARD UP) H : Hyperalimentation (TPN) A : Acetazolamide R : Renal Tubular Acidosis D : Diarrhea U : Ureteral diversion P : Pancreatic fistula GIT fistulas Clinical Features General Features: Lethargy Confusion Fatigue Nausea/vomiting Deep, rapid breathing (Kussmaul) Specific Features: DKA: Fruity breath, polyuria, polydipsia Uremia: Itching, volume overload Lactic acidosis: Shock, hypotension Toxic ingestion: Visual disturbances (methanol), oxalate crystals (ethylene glycol) Incorrect Options: pH-7.14, pCO 2 -20 mmHg, HCO 3 - 34 mEq/L (Option B) : Although the pH and pCO I suggest acidemia with respiratory compensation, the high HCO II (34 mEq/L) is inconsistent with metabolic acidosis. A high bicarbonate would be seen in metabolic alkalosis, which does not fit this clinical picture. pH-7.54, HCO 3 - 27 mEq/L, pCO 2 - 34 mmHg (Option C) : This option shows a high pH (7.54), indicating alkalosis. The pCO I is slightly low, suggesting respiratory alkalosis, while the HCO II is near normal. This acid-base picture does not match the metabolic acidosis expected in a dialysis patient with hyperkalemia. pH-7.4, HCO 3 - 27 mEq/L, pCO 2 - 40 mmHg (Option D) : This combination of normal pH, normal pCO 2 , and normal HCO 3 - does not indicate any significant acid-base imbalance. Therefore, this option is less likely to be the correct acid-base imbalance in this case. Reference: Harrison’s Principles Of Internal Medicine, 21st Edition, Volume I, Page: 361, 362, 364.",

      "explanation": "Correct Answer: B) Streptococcus pneumonia Explanation: The given scenario is of pneumonia in an AIDS-infected child. The most common organism causing fever, and productive cough , with given examination findings, is Streptococcus pneumonia . Pneumonia Etiology and Common Pathogens Main Pathogens : Bacteria, viruses, fungi, and protozoa. Typical Bacteria : Streptococcus pneumoniae , Haemophilus influenzae , Staphylococcus aureus (including MRSA). Atypical Bacteria : Mycoplasma pneumoniae , Chlamydia pneumoniae , Legionella species Viruses : Influenza, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), coronaviruses (e.g., SARS-CoV-2). Community-Acquired Pneumonia (CAP) Atypical Pneumonia Outpatients Hospitalised Patients Includes M.pneumoniae C.pneumoniae, and Legionella species. Common causes: S.pneumoniae , M.pneumoniae H. influenzae, C.pneumoniae, Respiratory viruses (influenza, RSV). Non-ICU ICU Patients Similar pathogens to outpatients, plus Legionella species. Pathogens include S.pneumoniae, S. aureus (including MRSA), Legionella species, gram-negative bacilli, and H. influenzae. Specific Pathogens in Certain Conditions: Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) : It can cause CAP, often complicating influenza infections. Community-acquired MRSA (CA-MRSA) has emerged as a significant cause of necrotizing pneumonia. Pneumococcal Pneumonia : Higher risk in elderly patients, and those with comorbidities like dementia, heart failure, cerebrovascular disease, alcoholism, smoking, COPD, and HIV infection. CA-MRSA Pneumonia : More likely in patients with prior skin infections or following viral illnesses. Enterobacteriaceae : Common in patients recently hospitalized, those treated with antibiotics, or those with comorbidities like alcoholism, heart failure, or renal failure. Pseudomonas aeruginosa : Found in patients with severe structural lung diseases such as bronchiectasis, cystic fibrosis, or advanced COPD. Legionella Infection : Associated with risk factors like diabetes, hematologic malignancies, cancer, severe renal disease, HIV, smoking, male gender, and recent travel (air conditioners, showers, hotels, cruise ships). It is an important cause of atypical pneumonia. Incorrect Options: Pneumocystis jirovecii (Option A) pneumonia (PJP) is a common opportunistic infection in patients with AIDS. However, it typically presents with non-productive cough, shortness of breath, and bilateral diffuse infiltrates on chest X-ray. Staphylococcus aureus (Option C) is another bacterium that can cause pneumonia in immunocompromised individuals, including those with AIDS. It is known for causing severe infections, including necrotizing pneumonia, but not the most common cause. Mycoplasma pneumoniae (Option D) is an atypical bacterium that can cause pneumonia, particularly in children and young adults. It often presents with a milder respiratory illness, including a persistent cough, headache, sore throat, and patchy infiltrates rather than lobar consolidation in the chest X-ray.",

      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: C) Tropical pulmonary eosinophilia Explanation: The nocturnal cough, fever, breathlessness, and wheezing with eosinophilia of >5000/µL and miliary pattern in chest X-ray all point to the diagnosis of tropical pulmonary eosinophilia. Tropical pulmonary eosinophilia (TPE) TPE is a pulmonary hyperreactive condition triggered by trapped microfilariae in lung tissue, leading to symptoms like nocturnal cough, dyspnea, and wheezing. Pathophysiology: Eosinophils are key in the pathogenesis, triggered by microfilariae released from the lymphatic system that become trapped in pulmonary microcirculation. Eosinophils degranulate, releasing proteins to clear microfilariae and cause lung damage. IL-4 promotes airway hyperactivity, while IFN-gamma suppresses it. An overactive TH2 response increases IL-4, IL-5, and specific IgG, IgM, and IgE antibodies, leading to eosinophilia. Clinical features: History of travel or residence in filarial endemic areas. Symptoms: Dry, paroxysmal, nocturnal cough Dyspnea Systemic signs (fever, malaise, weight loss) Peripheral eosinophilia (>3,000/mm³) Extrapulmonary signs: Lymphadenopathy, hepatosplenomegaly Physical Findings: Wheezing, crepitations, organomegaly, enlarged lymph nodes. Investigations: Blood Tests: Leukocytosis with eosinophilia, elevated IgE, filarial antibody titers. Stool Test: Rule out other parasitic causes. Imaging: Chest X-ray: Reticulonodular opacities, miliary mottling, or normal in 20-30% of cases. Chest CT: Bronchiectasis, lymphadenopathy, pleural effusion in unclear cases. Pulmonary Function Tests (PFTs): Mixed restrictive and mild to moderate obstructive patterns. Management: First-line : Diethylcarbamazine (DEC) for 21 days. It targets both microfilariae and adults, leading to dramatic symptom improvement. Adjunctive : Corticosteroids reduce airway inflammation, particularly in chronic cases. Alternative Drugs : Ivermectin and albendazole target microfilariae and adult worms, though there is limited data. Incorrect Options: Bronchial asthma (Option A) is a chronic respiratory condition characterized by inflammation and narrowing of the airways, leading to symptoms such as wheezing, coughing (often nocturnal), breathlessness, and occasionally fever. However, the presence of a miliary pattern on chest X-ray is not typical of bronchial asthma. Miliary tuberculosis (Option B) is a severe form of tuberculosis (TB) in which the infection spreads throughout the body, including the lungs. It is characterized by the dissemination of tiny, millimetre-sized lesions throughout various organs, including the lungs, giving a miliary pattern on chest X-ray. The elevated absolute eosinophil count is not typical of miliary tuberculosis. Hypersensitivity pneumonitis (HP) (Option D) , also known as extrinsic allergic alveolitis, is an immune-mediated lung disease caused by the inhalation of various organic substances such as dust, moulds, or animal proteins. The absolute eosinophil count can be elevated in some cases. However, the presence of a miliary pattern on chest X-ray is not typical of HP.",

      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer A - 1,2 Acid-base imbalance can be determined using arterial and venous pH. Arterial blood gas (ABG) analysis is the gold standard for assessing acid-base imbalance; however, venous blood gas (VBG) analysis correlates well with ABG and is a safer, less invasive alternative. The mean pH difference between ABG and VBG is minimal (ABG pH is higher by 0.03), making venous pH values acceptable for clinical use. Venous pO2 (Option 3): Venous and arterial pO2 values are not comparable because arterial pO2 is typically 36.9 mmHg higher than venous pO I , with significant variability. Venous pCO2 (Option 4): Venous and arterial pCO2 are not directly comparable as the mean difference between them is approximately 4.8 mmHg, which limits its reliability in assessing acid-base imbalance.

      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer B - Ambrisentan In patients with class II (low risk) pulmonary hypertension and a negative vasoreactive test, the next step in management is the use of ambrisentan , an endothelin receptor antagonist. Vasoreactivity Testing in PAH: Indication: Vasoreactivity testing is primarily reserved for patients with idiopathic or hereditary PAH. Preferred Vasodilators: Short-acting vasodilators such as inhaled nitric oxide (NO) or inhaled epoprostenol are preferred for the test. Positive Response: A decrease in mean pulmonary arterial pressure (mPAP) by ≥ 10 mmHg to an absolute level of ≤ 40 mmHg without a decrease in cardiac output (CO) is considered a positive vasoreactivity response. Treatment for Responders: Patients with a positive vasoreactivity response are considered for long-term treatment with calcium channel blockers ( nifedipine , diltiazem or amlodipine). (Option C) Negative Vasoreactivity : Treatment approach depends on clinical risk. Low- or Intermediate-Risk Patients (class II, III) : Initial treatment includes combination oral therapy, typically involving an endothelin receptor antagonist ( ambrisentan , sitaxsentan or bosentan) and a phosphodiesterase type 5 inhibitor (sildenafil or tadalafil). High-Risk Patients (Class IV) : Patients with advanced heart failure or syncope are treated with combination drug therapy, which includes intravenous prostacyclin therapy ( epoprostenol , treprostinil or iloprost ).

      "correct_answer": "D",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: D) Consider admission in a non-ICU setting Explanation: The patient's symptoms, such as productive cough, tachypnea, and hypotension, align with the diagnosis of pneumonia. The CURB-65 score of this patient is 2 (age >/= 65 and urea > 19mg/dl); hence, the patient can be considered for admission to a non-ICU setting for further management. Treatment for Lobar Pneumonia Treatment depends on severity; assess if inpatient or outpatient management is needed. CURB-65 Score: Used to stratify patients with the following factors: CURB-65 Symptom Score ( C ) Confusion 1 ( U ) Urea: BUN >19mg/dL (>7 mmol/L) 1 ( R ) Respiratory rate ≥ 30/min 1 ( B ) Blood Pressure – Systolic BP ≤ 90 mmHg or diastolic BP ≤ 60 mmHg 1 ( 65 ) Age ≥ 65 years 1 Hospitalization Criteria: CURB-65 score 1 or 2: Indicates hospitalization A score ≥ 3 : Indicates ICU admission and more intensive therapy . (Option B and C) Empiric Therapy: Outpatient: (Option A) When no symptoms in the CURB-65 scoring system are present. No comorbidities: Monotherapy with macrolides (Azithromycin, Clarithromycin). With comorbidities (chronic lung/heart disease, diabetes, smoking, HIV): Newer Fluoroquinolones (Levofloxacin, Moxifloxacin, Gemifloxacin) or a combination of beta-lactam (e.g., Amoxicillin) and a macrolide. Inpatient Non-ICU: Newer Fluoroquinolones (Levofloxacin, Moxifloxacin) alone or a combination of beta-lactam (e.g., Ampicillin, Ceftriaxone) and a macrolide. Inpatient ICU: Combination of macrolide (Azithromycin) or newer fluoroquinolone (Levofloxacin) with beta-lactam (e.g., Ampicillin-sulbactam, Ertapenem). If risk of aspiration, consider ampicillin-sulbactam or ertapenem; for Pseudomonas infection, use anti-pseudomonal beta-lactam (e.g., Piperacillin-tazobactam) with anti-pseudomonal fluoroquinolone (e.g., Ciprofloxacin). For MRSA, add vancomycin or linezolid. Duration of Therapy: Typically 5 to 7 days, extended if clinical response is delayed. Influenza Treatment: All hospitalized patients testing positive for influenza should receive Oseltamivir, regardless of illness onset.

      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: C) Hypoventilation Explanation: Hypoventilation causes hypoxemia by reducing both alveolar and arterial oxygen levels equally, resulting in a normal alveolar-arterial (A-a) gradient. Alveolar-Arterial Oxygen Gradient (A-a Gradient): The A-a gradient measures the difference between the oxygen concentration in the alveoli (PAO2) and the oxygen concentration in the arterial system (PaO2). Helps narrow the differential diagnosis for hypoxemia. A-a Gradient Formula: A-a Gradient = PAO2 – PaO2 (PAO2 = Alveolar oxygen tension, PaO2 = Arterial oxygen tension). Hypoventilation and A-a Gradient: Hypoventilation occurs when there is inadequate ventilation of the lungs, leading to decreased oxygen levels in the arterial system. Causes of Hypoventilation: CNS depression. Neuromuscular diseases (e.g., myasthenia gravis). Poor chest elasticity (e.g., kyphoscoliosis). Vertebral fractures and other factors. Hypoventilation affects both arterial oxygen tension (PaO I ) and alveolar oxygen tension (A I O I ), resulting in decreased oxygen levels in both the respiratory and circulatory systems. The A-a gradient (the difference between alveolar and arterial oxygen tensions) remains normal in hypoventilation because both PaO I and A I O I decrease in proportion. Right to left shunt (Option A) : In a right-to-left shunt, oxygenated blood bypasses the alveoli, mixing with deoxygenated blood and causing hypoxemia. This leads to an increased A-a gradient, as diffusion between capillaries and alveoli remains unaffected, but the lack of oxygenation of the shunted blood worsens the oxygenation process. Ventilation/perfusion (V/Q) mismatch (Option B) leads to a disparity between ventilation and perfusion in the lungs, resulting in an increased A-a gradient. This is because some areas of the lung are either under-ventilated or under-perfused, impairing the gas exchange process and increasing the gradient. Alveolar membrane damage (Option D) , seen in conditions like ARDS or pulmonary fibrosis, impairs the diffusion of oxygen across the alveolar-capillary barrier. This causes an increased A-a gradient as oxygen fails to transfer efficiently from the alveoli into the bloodstream, leading to hypoxemia. Reference: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK545153/#",

ARDS is a severe lung condition characterized by widespread inflammation and damage to the alveoli (air sacs) in the lungs. It can be triggered by various factors, including infection, sepsis, trauma, or inhalation injury. The key features of ARDS include acute onset of severe hypoxemia (low oxygen levels) that is refractory to supplemental oxygen, bilateral pulmonary infiltrates on imaging (such as the chest X-ray), and impaired lung compliance. Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS): ARDS is a diffuse neutrophilic alveolitis caused by infective & non-infective triggers. Berlin definition of ARDS: Onset within 1 week of a known clinical insult, or new or worsening respiratory symptoms Bilateral opacities on chest X-ray, not fully explained by effusions, lobar/lung collapse or nodules Respiratory failure not fully explained by cardiac failure or fluid overload. Objective assessment (e.g. by echocardiography) must exclude hydrostatic oedema if no risk factor is present Impaired oxygenation Pathophysiology: Activated neutrophils & macrophages → capillary permeability ↑ → alveolar damage Protein-rich exudate accumulation → hyaline membrane formation Cytokine & chemokine release → inflammatory cell recruitment Surfactant loss → alveolar collapse &",

A homogeneous opacity with obliteration of the costophrenic angle is typical. This appearance is marked by a curved upper border , known as the Ellis S-shaped curve . Obliteration of cardiophrenic angle . Ultrasound: More effective than X-ray in detecting fluid presence, showing a clear hypoechoic space indicative of transudate and moving densities suggesting exudate. Pleural fluid Analysis Light's Criteria Differentiates transudative from exudative pleural effusions based on LDH and protein levels in pleural fluid. An exudative pleural effusion meets at least one of the following: Pleural fluid protein/serum protein > 0.5 Pleural fluid LDH/serum LDH > 0.6 Pleural fluid LDH exceeds two-thirds of the normal upper limit for serum. ~25% of transudates may be misidentified as exudates.

      },
      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: A) Subcutaneous emphysema Explanation: The presence of crepitus after chest trauma suggests air leakage into the subcutaneous tissue, indicating subcutaneous emphysema. Subcutaneous Emphysema: Air accumulation in the subcutaneous tissue, which lies beneath the dermis. Can spread into deeper tissues, leading to pneumomediastinum, pneumothorax, pneumoperitoneum, or pneumoretroperitoneum. Causes: Traumatic: Blunt or penetrating injuries, barotrauma, bowel perforation, pulmonary blebs. Iatrogenic: Ventilator circuit malfunction or disruption. Improper pop-off valve closure. Valsalva maneuvres that increase thoracic pressure. Trauma to the airway. Clinical Features: Crepitus on palpation (crackling sensation or sound). Swelling in the chest, neck, or face; distorted facial appearance; vocal changes; dysphagia. Severe cases: Hemodynamic or respiratory compromise due to extensive air spread. Investigation: X-ray: Shows radiolucent streaks, “ginkgo leaf sign” on chest radiograph. CT scan: Detects deeper air pockets and the source of air leakage. Ultrasound: May reveal hyperechoic scattered densities. Management: Mild cases: Observation, as resolution usually occurs within 10 days if the underlying cause is controlled. Oxygen therapy: Helps nitrogen washout and promotes reabsorption of gas, especially in pneumothorax/pneumomediastinum. Ventilated patients: Reduce tidal volume, PEEP, and avoid bronchospasm to minimize progression. Surgical intervention (for severe cases): Bilateral infraclavicular incisions (2 cm) to release air. Subcutaneous drains in extreme cases. Airway management: Consider tracheostomy if there is a tracheal tear with worsening subcutaneous emphysema. Antibiotics: If mucosal injury is suspected to prevent mediastinitis. Gas gangrene (Option B) is caused by Clostridium species and involves severe tissue destruction and infection, often in the context of deep wounds or surgical procedures. It typically leads to more systemic signs such as fever, shock, and tissue necrosis, which are not seen in this case. It is not directly related to chest trauma or the presence of crepitus, making it an incorrect option. Acute tubular necrosis (Option C) refers to kidney damage due to ischemia, toxins, or infection, leading to renal dysfunction. It does not present with crepitus or air trapped in the subcutaneous tissue, and is unrelated to chest trauma. Therefore, it is not relevant to this clinical scenario. SVC syndrome (Option D) : Superior vena cava syndrome results from partial or complete obstruction of the SVC, usually due to thrombus formation or tumor infiltration. It presents with symptoms such as face/neck swelling, distended neck veins, cough, dyspnea, orthopnea, and upper extremity swelling. However, SVC syndrome does not involve crepitus, which is the hallmark of subcutaneous emphysema.

      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: B) CT pulmonary angiography Explanation: CT pulmonary angiogram is the gold standard for diagnosing pulmonary embolism , as it allows direct visualization of the pulmonary arteries and identification of any occlusions. Investigations for Pulmonary Embolism (PE) Clinical Evaluation PE symptoms are nonspecific, often leading to excessive use of CT pulmonary angiograms. Age-adjusted d-dimer testing is recommended for patients over 50 years with low-to-moderate PE probability. D-Dimer A sensitive but nonspecific test for PE. Elevated levels indicate possible PE but can also occur with conditions like MI, pneumonia, or sepsis. Normal d-dimer helps rule out PE. Electrocardiogram (ECG) Common findings include sinus tachycardia(most common) and the S1Q3T3 sign (most specific) (S wave in lead I, Q wave in lead III, inverted T wave in lead III). T-wave inversion in V1 to V4 suggests RV strain or ischemia. Venous Ultrasonography Uses loss of vein compressibility as a key indicator for diagnosing DVT, which is associated with PE. Doppler imaging can assess blood flow dynamics. Chest X-ray Often normal but may show specific signs like Westermark’s sign (focal oligemia), Hampton’s hump (wedge-shaped pleural density), or Palla’s sign (enlarged pulmonary artery). Chest radiograph demonstrating focal oligemia (Westermark’s sign) in the right lung (area between white arrowheads) and a prominent right descending pulmonary artery (Palla’s sign) (black arrow). The chest radiograph demonstrates a wedge-shaped opacity (arrow) in the right middle lobe consistent with Hampton hump. Chest CT with Contrast The primary imaging test. It offers high-resolution visualisation of pulmonary vasculature. RV enlargement on CT indicates a higher risk of mortality. Lung Scanning A second-line test, mostly for patients who can’t tolerate contrast. High-probability perfusion scans (two or more segmental perfusion defects) strongly suggest PE. Magnetic Resonance (MR) Imaging MR venography with gadolinium can diagnose DVT when ultrasound is inconclusive, though MR pulmonary angiography (Option D) is less reliable for smaller PEs. Echocardiography It is not reliable (Option A) for directly diagnosing PE but useful for detecting mimicking conditions. McConnell’s sign (RV-free wall hypokinesis) is an indirect sign of PE. CT Pulmonary Angiography Identifies intraluminal filling defects or abrupt vessel occlusion. Ventilation-perfusion (V/Q) scan (Option C) can suggest the likelihood of PE by showing mismatched perfusion defects, but it is not as definitive as other imaging modalities.",

Pulmonary effects : Fat emboli occlude microvasculature, leading to inflammatory responses and endothelial injury. Pulmonary consequences mimic acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), presenting within 24 hours with symptoms of respiratory failure. Fatty acids released from emboli increase vascular permeability, causing alveolar haemorrhage and oedema.

The presence of crepitus is a characteristic finding in subcutaneous emphysema. The description of the image-based question mentioning the face of the man showing edema is not directly related to the diagnosis of subcutaneous emphysema. Edema refers to the swelling caused by an accumulation of fluid in the tissues, and it can have various causes. However, it is not a specific feature of subcutaneous emphysema. Incorrect Options: Option B - Gas gangrene: Gas gangrene is a severe and potentially life-threatening infection caused by certain bacteria, such as Clostridium species. It is characterized by the rapid spread of infection, tissue destruction, and gas production within the affected tissues. Gas gangrene is not directly related to chest trauma or the presence of crepitus, so it is an incorrect option in this case.

Both Pneumonia > Sepsis are the leading causes of ARDS Incorrect Options: Option B - Fat embolism syndrome following femur shaft fracture: Fat embolism syndrome occurs when fat globules are released into the bloodstream, typically following long bone fractures. These fat globules can obstruct blood vessels in the lungs, leading to inflammation and lung injury. Fat embolism syndrome can cause ARDS at the blood-lung interface. Option C - Sepsis : Sepsis is a systemic inflammatory response to infection that can lead to organ dysfunction. In severe cases, sepsis can cause ARDS, as the inflammatory response affects the blood-lung interface and results in lung injury. Option D - Transfusion-related lung injury : Transfusion-related lung injury (TRALI) occurs when donor antibodies or other components in blood products trigger an immune response, leading to lung injury.

      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: A) Asbestosis Explanation: The clinical presentation indicates asbestosis , a form of pneumoconiosis caused by prolonged asbestos exposure. The key diagnostic features in this case include the patient's 20-year occupational exposure in a factory setting, presenting symptom of breathlessness, and most importantly, the HRCT findings of pleural thickening and fibrosis . Pleural involvement i s a characteristic feature of asbestos-related lung disease , distinguishing it from other occupational lung diseases. Workers in the shipbuilding and construction trades, including pipe fitters and boilermakers, are occupationally exposed to asbestos. Asbestosis is a diffuse interstitial fibrosing disease of the lung . Past exposure to asbestos is specifically indicated by pleural plaques on chest radiographs, which are characterized by either thickening or calcification along the parietal pleura, particularly along the lower lung fields. Pulmonary function testing in asbestosis reveals a restrictive pattern with a decrease in both lung volumes and diffusing capacity. Complications include carcinoma of lung and mesothelioma . Coal worker pneumoconiosis (Option B) is characterized by small nodules diffusely distributed throughout the lungs, with upper lobe predominance and eggshell calcification of hilar lymph nodes. The presence of pleural thickening rather than nodular opacities makes this diagnosis less likely. Silicosis (Option C) typically presents with multiple small nodules in the upper lung zones with a characteristic \"ground-glass\" appearance. The absence of these findings and the presence of pleural thickening make silicosis an unlikely diagnosis. Berylliosis (Option D) presents with early-stage parenchymal nodules and later develops lymphadenopathy and interstitial fibrosis. The prominent pleural involvement seen in this case is not typical of berylliosis, and the exposure history doesn't suggest beryllium exposure.

      },
      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: A) Hypokalemic hypochloremic metabolic alkalosis with hyponatremia Development of metabolic Alkalosis due to vomiting Occurs due to a net gain of bicarbonate (HCO3 − ) or loss of nonvolatile acid (usually HCl) from the extracellular fluid, commonly caused by vomiting. Generation Stage: Vomiting leads to the loss of HCl from the stomach, preventing HCO3 − secretion in the small intestine. As a result, HCO3 − gets retained in the extracellular fluid, leading to the development of metabolic alkalosis . Maintenance Stage: After vomiting ceases, the kidneys fail to appropriately excrete the excess HCO3 − , maintaining the alkalosis. This failure is influenced by factors such as volume deficiency, chloride deficiency , and potassium deficiency , combined with a reduced glomerular filtration rate (GFR). Saline-Responsive Metabolic Alkalosis: In cases of volume, chloride, and potassium deficiency, the alkalosis can be corrected by restoring extracellular fluid volume through intravenous administration of NaCl and KCl. Saline-Unresponsive Metabolic Alkalosis: In cases of hypokalemia due to hyperaldosteronism, the alkalosis may require pharmacologic or surgical treatment, rather than saline correction. Metabolic Alkalosis: Metabolic alkalosis is characterized by an increase in arterial pH , elevated serum bicarbonate [HCO3 − ], and increased PaCO2 I due to compensatory hypoventilation. Often presents with hypochloremia and hypokalemia . Occurs as a mixed disorder with respiratory or metabolic acidosis or alkalosis. Clinical Features Neurological: Mental confusion, obtundation, potential seizures Peripheral Nervous System: Paresthesias, muscle cramps, tetany (similar to hypocalcemia effects) Cardiovascular: Aggravation of arrhythmias, particularly in COPD patients Electrolyte Imbalances Potassium (K I ): Hypokalemia , especially in cases involving secondary hyperaldosteronism or diuretic use.

These effusions develop in about 40-60% of patients with bacterial pneumonia. Types: Parapneumonic effusions can be categorized into three stages: simple (uncomplicated), complicated, and empyema. Simple parapneumonic effusions , the pleural fluid is sterile and can resolve with antibiotic therapy alone. Complicated parapneumonic effusions contain bacteria and require drainage in addition to antibiotics. Empyema represents the most advanced stage where frank pus is present in the pleural space. Diagnostic Criteria: Simple Parapneumonic Effusion Appearance: Serous PMN++, sterile fluid (negative bacterial culture) pH >7.3, LDH <500 U/L, glucose >80 mg/dL Fluid-glucose: serum-glucose >0.5 Complicated Parapneumonic Effusion Appearance: Turbid PMN++, bacterial culture may be + or - pH <7.1, LDH >1000 U/L, glucose <40 mg/dL Fluid-glucose: serum-glucose <0.5 Empyema Appearance: Pus PMN++, bacterial culture positive or negative pH <7.1, LDH >1000 U/L, glucose <40 mg/dL Fluid-glucose: serum-glucose <0.5 Management: Drain with antibiotics; small-bore drains (10-14 gauge) are often preferable.

The next best step is needle decompression at the 5th intercostal space, anterior to the midaxillary line . TENSION PNEUMOTHORAX Pathophysiology D/t ‘one-way valve’ air leaks from the lung or chest wall. Air is sucked into the thoracic cavity without any escape, collapsing and compressing the affected lung. The mediastinum shifts to the opposite side, reducing venous return and compressing the opposite lung, leading to decreased cardiac output and function. This can result in sudden death. Causes Penetrating Chest Trauma. Blunt Chest Trauma with parenchymal lung injury and persistent air leak. Iatrogenic Lung Injury (e.g., central venepuncture) Mechanical Positive-Pressure Ventilation. Clinical Features Tachypnea and Tachycardia Hyper-resonance and Decreased/Absent Breath Sounds Resonant Percussion with severe mediastinal/tracheal shift Cyanosis and Hypotension Chest Pain Distended Neck Veins Subcutaneous emphysema Emergency Management Tension pneumothorax is a clinical diagnosis, and treatment should never be delayed by waiting for radiological confirmation. Immediate Thoracocentesis (needle): Wide bore needle (typically a 20- or 22-gauge) in the 5th intercostal space in the safety triangle.

Additional Care Antibiotics and analgesics for treatment. Ventilator Support with IPPV in severe cases. Start IV fluids with a large bore cannula (Option A): While IV fluids are important in managing hypotension, they do not address the underlying problem of tension pneumothorax, which is the primary cause of the patient's instability. Take the patient to the ICU and intubate him (Option C): Intubation and ICU care may be necessary later, but delaying decompression can lead to rapid deterioration. Positive pressure ventilation without prior decompression could worsen the tension pneumothorax. Start positive pressure ventilation (Option D): This is contraindicated in tension pneumothorax because it can further increase intrathoracic pressure and exacerbate the condition, leading to cardiovascular collapse",

        "D": "Increased excretion of H+"
      },
      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: A) Hypoventilation causing decreased CO2 washout Explanation: The mechanism for the secondary disorder is Hypoventilation causing decreased CO2 washout. The arterial blood gas findings indicate partially compensated metabolic acidosis. Compensation is incomplete because the reduction in PaCO2 is insufficient for the degree of bicarbonate reduction, suggesting a secondary respiratory acidosis caused by hypoventilation. Hypoventilation reduces the ability to wash out CO2, leading to higher-than-expected PaCO2 levels. The expected PaCO2 can be calculated using Winter's formula: Expected PaCO2 = (1.5 × HCO3 − ) + 8 ± 2 For HCO3 − = 10 mEq/L: Expected PaCO2 = (1.5 × 10) + 8 ± 2 = 21 to 25 mmHg. The actual PaCO2 of 30 mmHg exceeds the expected range, indicating an additional respiratory acidosis due to hypoventilation. Thus a mixed acid-base disorder is present, combining metabolic acidosis with respiratory acidosis. Hyperventilation causing decreased CO I washout (Option B): Hyperventilation would enhance CO I elimination, leading to a lower PaCO I , which would provide better compensation for metabolic acidosis. However, in this case, the PaCO I is higher than expected (30 mmHg compared to the expected 21-25 mmHg), which rules out hyperventilation. Instead, the findings indicate inadequate CO I elimination due to hypoventilation. Increased tubular reabsorption of HCO II (Option C): Increased tubular reabsorption of bicarbonate occurs as a renal compensation mechanism in response to respiratory acidosis, not metabolic acidosis. Since this is primarily a case of metabolic acidosis, increased bicarbonate reabsorption is not the compensatory mechanism here. Increased excretion of H I (Option D) by the kidneys is a compensatory response to metabolic acidosis, but it is a slower process that takes days to have a significant effect. This mechanism does not explain the higher-than-expected PaCO I observed in this case, which is due to hypoventilation causing decreased CO I elimination.

Management of Acute Exacerbation of COPD: Initial Management and Assessment: Home management: Increased bronchodilator therapy, short course of oral glucocorticoids, and possibly antibiotics. Hospital referral indicators: Cyanosis Peripheral oedema Altered consciousness Comprehensive assessment upon admission: Level of consciousness (response to commands, ability to cough) Signs of CO2 retention (warm peripheries, bounding pulse, flapping tremor) Airway obstruction assessment (wheeze, prolonged expiration) Signs of cor pulmonale (peripheral oedema, raised JVP) Background functional status and quality of life Precipitating causes (e.g., infection, environmental factors) Investigations: Investigation Purpose/Findings Arterial blood gases Assess severity of hypoxaemia, hypercapnia, acidaemia; guide oxygen therapy and ventilation. Chest X-ray Identify complications such as pneumonia, pneumothorax, or pleural effusion. Management Strategies: Management Details Oxygen Therapy Administer controlled oxygen at 24% or 28% to maintain PaO2 > 8 kPa (60 mmHg) or SaO2 > 90%. Regular arterial blood gas monitoring to adjust therapy. Non-Invasive Ventilation (NIV) Safe for mild to moderate respiratory acidosis; helps reduce intubation need and mortality. Not suitable for patients unable to protect their airway. Bronchodilators Use nebulised short-acting β 2-agonists (e.g., salbutamol, terbutaline) with anticholinergics (e.g., ipratropium). If oxygen sensitivity is a concern, use compressed air for nebulisation. Glucocorticoids Administer oral prednisolone (30 mg for 10 days) to reduce symptoms and improve lung function.Reduces frequency and severity of exacerbations. Consider osteoporosis prophylaxis for repeated courses. Antibiotic Therapy Indicated for increased sputum purulence, volume, or breathlessness. Use simple regimens (aminopenicillin, tetracycline, macrolide); co-amoxiclav in areas with β -lactamase organisms. Mechanical Ventilation (Option B) Consider if there is a reversible cause, no prior respiratory failure, or if NIV has failed/contraindicated. Decisions should involve the patient, family, and GP. Additional Therapy Diuretics for peripheral oedema. Limited evidence for intravenous aminophylline; consider arrhythmia risk. Doxapram may be used short-term for low respiratory rates. Discharge and Follow-Up: Discharge criteria: Clinically stable on maintenance medication. Off nebulised therapy for at least 24 hours. PEF reaches 75% of predicted or personal best. Post-exacerbation follow-up: Identify and avoid trigger factors. Provide asthma education and a written self-management plan. IV corticosteroids should be administered (Option C): Systemic corticosteroids are helpful in treating acute COPD exacerbations by reducing airway inflammation and improving lung function over time, but their effects are not immediate.

      "explanation": "Correct Answer: D) Ultrasound-guided aspiration Explanation: As the patient's chest X-ray reveals a significant amount of fluid accumulation on the left thorax and as the patient is also intubated, ultrasound-guided aspiration may be a reasonable next step. It is often done to improve respiratory function and prevent complications associated with accumulation of fluid in the lungs. Ultrasound serves a complementary role in chest imaging, particularly in evaluating fluid collections. Applications of Ultrasound: Pleural Effusion: Used for detection and guiding the drainage of fluid collections. Pericardial Effusion: Evaluates the presence of fluid around the heart and for assessing cardiac function. Suctioning (Option A) is a routine procedure used to clear the airway of secretions or foreign material. While suctioning may be necessary for some intubated patients, it is not a next specific step . The appropriateness of suctioning would depend on the patient's clinical condition and the presence of indications for suctioning. Chest physiotherapy (Option B) techniques, such as postural drainage, percussion, and vibration, are often used to help mobilize secretions and improve airway clearance. While these techniques may be beneficial in certain cases, they are not the next specific steps for this patient . Starting antibiotics and sending samples for culture (Option C) may be appropriate in certain situations, such as suspected or confirmed respiratory infection. However, the decision to start antibiotics and send samples for culture should be based on a comprehensive evaluation of the patient's clinical presentation, including signs and symptoms of infection. It cannot be determined solely based on the information of an X-ray finding.",

      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: B) CT Explanation: CT chest (computed tomography) is the next most useful diagnostic investigation. CT scan provides detailed imaging of the lungs and can help identify subtle abnormalities that may not be visible on a chest X-ray. It can detect small nodules, bronchial wall thickening, or other structural changes in the lungs that could be contributing to the hemoptysis. CT scan is commonly used in the evaluation of hemoptysis, especially when the chest X-ray is normal or inconclusive. Computed Tomography (CT) CT scans are the preferred imaging modality for various lung pathologies due to their ability to produce detailed cross-sectional images of the chest. This high-resolution imaging allows for the precise visualization of thoracic structures. Multiple Windows for Enhanced Visualization: Lung Window: Optimizes the visibility of lung parenchyma and vascular structures. Mediastinal Window: Ideal for assessing soft tissues in the mediastinum, including lymph nodes and masses. Bone Window: Focuses on cortical bone to evaluate bony structures. Types of CT Scans: Non-Contrast CT (NCCT): Often sufficient for initial evaluations of lung pathologies. Contrast-Enhanced CT (CECT): Indicated in cases involving space-occupying lesions, infections, or inflammatory processes. CECT is particularly beneficial for detecting filling defects, which are crucial in diagnosing vascular conditions such as pulmonary embolism and aortic aneurysms. Normal CT Abdomen Normal CECT Abdomen Common Thoracic Pathologies Diagnosed with CT: Pulmonary Embolism: CECT is effective in visualizing filling defects within pulmonary arteries. Interstitial Lung Disease: High-resolution CT (HRCT) is essential for characterizing various interstitial lung diseases. Mediastinal Masses: CT aids in evaluating lymphadenopathy and tumors within the mediastinum.",

These values, combined with morning wheezing and dyspnea, are diagnostic of mild bronchial asthma. Diagnostic Tests for Bronchial Asthama Test Details Spirometry/PFTs Best initial test IOC Obstructive pattern Reversible with short-acting β 2-agonists (SABAs) Findings: FEV1/FVC < 70% ↓ FEV1 Normal or ↓ FVC ↑ Residual Volume (RV) ↑ Total Lung Capacity (TLC) Normal or ↑ Diffusing Capacity of Lung for Carbon Monoxide (DLCO) Reversibility: Increase in FEV1 ≥ 12% and >200 mL with SABA (albuterol) PFTs between exacerbations: Often normal Methacholine Challenge Tests for bronchial hyperresponsiveness Positive if ≥ 20% decrease in FEV1 Sensitive but not specific Arterial blood gas Early Respiratory alkalosis ( ↓ PaCO2, ↑ pH) due to hyperventilation Late Respiratory acidosis due to muscle fatigue (normalizing PaCO2, normalizing pH, ↓ PaO2) Chest X-ray Normal appearance to hyperinflation with flattening of the diaphragm Classification of Asthma Severity: Spirometry Assessment : Post-bronchodilator FEV1 : Air exhaled in one second after bronchodilator use. FEV1/FVC Ratio : Indicates obstruction if <0.7. Severity Categories: Mild : FEV1 ≥ 80% of predicted Moderate : FEV1 50-79% of predicted Severe : FEV1 30-49% of predicted Very Severe : FEV1 < 30% of predicted ILD (Option B) : Interstitial lung disease typically shows a restrictive pattern with reduced FEV I but a normal or increased FEV I /FVC ratio, not the reduced ratio seen in this case (Option B ruled out). ILD characteristically presents with a reduced total lung capacity and diffusion capacity. IPF (Option C) : In idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, the FEV I /FVC ratio is typically normal or increased as both values are reduced proportionally due to the restrictive pattern. The condition does not present with the obstructive pattern described in the question. Silicosis (Option D) : While silicosis can cause progressive decrease in FEV I , it primarily presents as a restrictive lung disease with reduced lung volumes but preserved FEV I /FVC ratio. Also, morning wheezing is not a typical feature of silicosis. Reference: Davidson’s Principles and Practice of Medicine, 24th Edition, Page 570- 576.",

      "explanation": "Correct Answer: C) Ceftriaxone + Azithromycin Explanation: The scenario here is severe pneumonia signified by admission to the ICU; hence, the best treatment modality is beta-lactam + macrolide, i.e., Ceftriaxone + Azithromycin . Treatment for Lobar Pneumonia Treatment depends on severity ; assess if inpatient or outpatient management is needed. CURB-65 Score: Used to stratify patients with the following factors: CURB-65 Symptom Score ( C ) Confusion 1 ( U ) Urea: BUN >19mg/dL (>7 mmol/L) 1 ( R ) Respiratory rate ≥ 30/min 1 ( B ) Blood Pressure - Systolic BP ≤ 90 mmHg or diastolic BP ≤ 60 mmHg 1 ( 65 ) Age ≥ 65 years 1 Hospitalisation Criteria: CURB-65 score 0: Outpatient treatment Score 1 or 2: Indicates hospitalization Score ≥ 3: Indicates ICU admission and more intensive therapy. Empiric Therapy: Outpatient: No comorbidities: Monotherapy with macrolides (Azithromycin, Clarithromycin). With comorbidities (chronic lung/heart disease, diabetes, smoking, HIV): Newer fluoroquinolones (Levofloxacin, Moxifloxacin, Gemifloxacin) or a combination of beta-lactam (e.g., amoxicillin) and a macrolide. Inpatient Non-ICU: Newer fluoroquinolones (Levofloxacin, Moxifloxacin) alone or a combination of beta-lactam (e.g., Ampicillin, Ceftriaxone) and a macrolide. Inpatient ICU: Combination of macrolide (Azithromycin) with beta-lactam (e.g., Ampicillin-sulbactam, Ertapenem, Cephalosporins ) or a newer fluoroquinolone (Levofloxacin). If risk of aspiration, consider Ampicillin-sulbactam or Ertapenem; for Pseudomonas infection, use anti-pseudomonal beta-lactam (e.g., Piperacillin-Tazobactam) with anti-pseudomonal fluoroquinolone (e.g., Ciprofloxacin). For MRSA, add Vancomycin or Linezolid. Duration of Therapy: Typically 5 to 7 days, extended if clinical response is delayed. Influenza Treatment: All hospitalized patients testing positive for influenza should receive Oseltamivir, regardless of illness onset. Incorrect Options: Amoxicillin with clavulinic acid (Option A) : Inadequate for this patient due to the severity of his illness and the risk of resistant organisms. Monotherapy with amoxicillin does not provide sufficient coverage for his condition, especially considering the possibility of Pseudomonas and MRSA. Azithromycin (Option B) : Not appropriate for this patient due to the severity of his condition, indicating he requires more intensive treatment. Azithromycin is preferred for outpatient therapy, suitable for lower-risk patients without significant comorbidities. Piptaz + Ciprofloxacin (Option D) : Piptaz (Piperacillin/Tazobactam) is a combination which is a beta lactam antibiotic. Ciprofloxacin is a fluoroquinolone antibiotic. However, as mentioned above this is not suitable for the condition of the patient here as a macrolide is necessary along with a Fluoroquinolone or a beta-lactam to treat severe pneumonia.

In this case, the patient's sudden onset of breathlessness and chest pain raises suspicion for a possible pulmonary embolism. A CTPA (computed tomography pulmonary angiography) was performed, a standard imaging technique to diagnose PE.

      "explanation": "obese individuals who experience hypoventilation (inadequate breathing) during sleep and wakefulness. The elevated BMI, daytime sleepiness, and memory loss are consistent with OHS. The elevated pCO2 (53 mmHg) and elevated HCO3 (33 mmol/L) on the ABG indicate chronic respiratory acidosis and compensation, which is a characteristic feature of OHS. The high blood pressure (BP) also supports this diagnosis as OHS is associated with increased cardiovascular risks. In summary given the patient's severe obesity, daytime sleepiness, memory loss, high BMI, elevated BP, and the ABG results showing chronic respiratory acidosis, the most likely diagnosis is Obesity Hypoventilation Syndrome Incorrect Options: Option B - Central Sleep Apnea (CSA): CSA involves a dysfunction in the central nervous system's control of breathing during sleep, leading to temporary cessation of breathing. While CSA can cause daytime sleepiness, the ABG values (elevated pCO2 and HCO3) suggest a respiratory-related issue rather than a primary central nervous system problem. Option C - Narcolepsy: Narcolepsy is a neurological disorder characterized by excessive daytime sleepiness, often accompanied by sudden muscle weakness (cataplexy), sleep paralysis, and vivid dream-like hallucinations. It doesn't typically involve significant respiratory disturbances as seen in this case. Option D - Obstructive Sleep Apnea (OSA): OSA is a condition where the airway becomes partially or completely blocked during sleep, leading to repeated pauses in breathing. While OSA can cause daytime sleepiness and memory issues, the ABG findings of elevated pCO2 and HCO3 are more indicative of a chronic respiratory problem like OHS. Reference: .",

      },
      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer C - Obesity hypo-ventilation syndrome Obesity hypo-ventilation syndrome (OHS) is defined by raised 'awake' arterial pressure of carbon dioxide levels in patients with obesity for whom alternative causes of hypercapnia and hypoventilation have been excluded. This is caused due to obesity causing a restriction in lung filling and this causes hypoventilation . In this patient with hypercapnia while awake, with compensatory metabolic alkalosis, the diagnosis is likely OHS . Diagnosis Criteria: Body mass index (BMI) ≥ 30 kg/m². Chronic daytime alveolar hypoventilation, defined as Paco2 ≥ 45 mmHg in the absence of other causes. Evidence of sleep-disordered breathing, usually in the form of obstructive sleep apnea (OSA). Risk Factors: Severe obesity (BMI >40 kg/m²) and severe obstructive sleep apnea (AHI >30 events/hour) are considered risk factors for OHS. Pathophysiology: Hypoventilation is caused by factors like OSA, increased work of breathing, respiratory muscle impairment due to excess adiposity, and poor ventilatory response to hypoxemia and hypercapnia. These issues can improve with the treatment of sleep-disordered breathing (CPAP or NIPPV), suggesting that impaired ventilatory drive is a consequence, not the cause, of OHS. Treatment: Weight reduction : Significant weight loss (20–25% of body weight) can normalize Paco2, but weight loss alone is challenging without bariatric surgery. Positive airway pressure: CPAP or NIPPV (Non-invasive positive pressure ventilation) during sleep is the primary treatment. CPAP is effective in improving daytime hypercapnia and hypoxemia, especially in patients with severe OSA. Bilevel positive airway pressure (BiPAP) should be used for those who cannot tolerate CPAP or if obstructive events persist. Bilevel PAP with a backup rate (BiPAP ST or volume-assured pressure support) is suggested for persistent hypercapnia or acute decompensated OHS. Management of Comorbidities: Other conditions that impair ventilation, such as COPD, should be treated concurrently with OHS. Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) (Option A) is a disorder that is characterized by obstructive apneas and hypopneas due to repetitive collapse of the upper airway during sleep. The clinical features against OSA include hypercapnia and hypoxemia in an awake individual . Narcolepsy (Option B) is characterized by excessive daytime sleepiness, sudden loss of muscle tone (cataplexy), and disrupted sleep patterns. While impaired concentration and memory can be seen in narcolepsy, the ABG is normal. Central sleep apnea (Option D) is a condition in which there is a lack of respiratory effort during sleep, leading to pauses in breathing. Impaired concentration and memory can occur in central sleep apnea. Reference: Harrison’s Principles of Internal Medicine, 21st Edition, Page: 2203, 2204.",

This syndrome is specifically associated with coal worker's pneumoconiosis but can also occur in other forms of pneumoconiosis. Asbestosis is a lung disease caused by the inhalation of asbestos fibres. Pleural effusion can be seen in the advanced stages of the disease. Mesothelioma is a rare and aggressive malignant tumour originating from the mesothelial cells lining the pleura (the thin membrane surrounding the lungs).

      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: B) Long-Term Oxygen Therapy (LTOT) Explanation: The clinical manifestations indicate persistent symptoms of obstructive lung disease despite optimal bronchodilator therapy with salmeterol (LABA) and tiotropium (LAMA). Long-Term Oxygen Therapy (LTOT) is the most appropriate next step in management as it addresses potential hypoxemia , which is often present in patients with chronic obstructive lung disease experiencing persistent symptoms. This therapy can improve survival and quality of life in patients who are already on bronchodilator therapy, by increasing oxygen levels in the blood and reducing the strain on the cardiopulmonary system. Interventions for Improved Survival in COPD: Smoking Cessation: Most crucial intervention for improving survival. Slows decline in lung function (FEV1), altering disease progression. Long-Term Oxygen Therapy (LTOT): Improves survival in severe hypoxaemia (PaO2 < 7.3 kPa). Recommended use: at least 15 hours/day, with greater benefit at >20 hours/day. Pulmonary Rehabilitation: Improves symptoms, exercise tolerance, and health status. May contribute to better survival, though direct link needs more research. Management of Exacerbations: Crucial for reducing mortality. Key components: Controlled oxygen therapy (24%-28%) to maintain PaO2 > 8 kPa. Nebulised bronchodilators: salbutamol + ipratropium. Oral glucocorticoids: prednisolone 30 mg for 10 days. Antibiotics for increased sputum purulence/volume, breathlessness. Non-invasive ventilation (NIV) for mild-moderate acidosis (pH < 7.35). Vaccination: Annual influenza and pneumococcal vaccinations to prevent infections and exacerbations. Multidisciplinary Management: Address comorbidities (e.g., obesity, malnutrition, depression, social isolation). These factors impact overall health and survival. Nebulization with LAMA-LABA (Option A) provides the same medications the patient is already taking in a different delivery form. Switching to nebulized form of the same medications is unlikely to provide significant additional benefit when the patient is already on optimal inhaler therapy. Positive Pressure Ventilation (Option C) is typically reserved for acute respiratory failure or severe COPD exacerbations requiring intensive care management. It is not an appropriate choice for chronic outpatient management of stable COPD with persistent symptoms. Pneumococcal Vaccine (Option D) is an important preventive measure for COPD patients to prevent infectious exacerbations. However, it would not address the immediate concern of persistent breathlessness and frequent exacerbations in a patient already on optimal bronchodilator therapy.

This pattern occurs when a space-occupying lesion or massive fluid collection (such as due to a lung cancer) in the thoracic cavity creates enough mass effect to push the mediastinal structures away from the affected side. The pleural fluid is seen as opacity (single large black arrow) with lateral upward sloping of a meniscus- shaped contour. The right diaphragmatic contour is also completely obliterated, indicating presence of fluid in the right pleural space. In spite of a moderately large right pleural effusion , the trachea appears to be slightly shifted to the right side (as depicted by small black arrows) indicating an underlying lung pathology on the right side. Pneumothorax (Option A) typically presents with a hyperlucent lung field without vascular markings due to air collection in the pleural space. In this X-ray, we see opacity rather than hyperlucency.

      "explanation": "Correct Answer: B) Malignant mesothelioma Explanation: Malignant mesothelioma is a tumor of mesothelial cells. It is the most specific malignancy seen in asbestosis Workers in the shipbuilding and construction trades, including pipe fitters and boilermakers, are occupationally exposed to asbestos. Asbestosis is a diffuse interstitial fibrosing disease of the lung. Past exposure to asbestos is specifically indicated by pleural plaques on chest radiographs, which are characterized by either thickening or calcification along the parietal pleura, particularly along the lower lung fields. Pulmonary function testing in asbestosis reveals a restrictive pattern with a decrease in both lung volumes and diffusing capacity. Complications include mesothelioma and carcinoma of the lung . Mesothelioma A rare cancer arising from mesothelial cells that most commonly affects the pleura. It can also affect the peritoneum, pericardium and tunica vaginalis. Aetiology Asbestos: Mesothelioma is the most specific asbestos-associated cancer . It is not associated with smoking. Pathology Advanced pleural mesothelioma can cause extensive pleural fibrosis and thickening, making the affected side rigid and immobile. Later stages fix the mediastinum in place due to pleural thickening and fibrosis. The mediastinal shift is not a characteristic feature of mesothelioma. M/C cytogenetic abnormality in mesothelioma: Homozygous deletion of chromosome 9p , leading to loss of tumour suppressor gene- CDKN2A. Clinical features Progressive dyspnea, chest pain, weight loss, chronic cough, hemoptysis. Decreased breath sounds and dullness to percussion (due to pleural effusion or thickening). Diagnosis CT scan: Pleural thickening, effusion, or frozen hemithorax (not causing a mediastinal shift in the presence of effusion) Confirmed by biopsy: Epithelioid mesothelioma shows tubules, nests, or papillary structures with uniform round to oval nuclei and eosinophilic cytoplasm. Sarcomatoid mesothelioma consists of spindle-shaped cells resembling fibrosarcoma. Biphasic mesothelioma displays a mixture of both patterns. Specific markers for mesothelioma: Calretinin. Epithelial membrane antigen. Cytokeratin. Mesothelin. Mesothelioma- Gross Mesothelioma- H & E stain Mesothelioma- Calretinin stain Coarse, partially calcified right pleural plaques, accompanied by massive right pleural effusion, causing total right lung collapse and mass effect. Lobulated pleural soft tissue mass encasing the right lung. Associated erosion of the right 3rd rib anteriorly. Calcified pleural plaques were noted bilaterally, indicating previous asbestos exposure. Bronchogenic carcinoma (Option A) is the most common lung malignancy, it is not the most specific malignancy associated with asbestos exposure (shipbuilding → asbestos exposure)",

        "A": "Low protein in pleural fluid",
        "B": "High protein in pleural fluid",

        "D": "High sugar in pleural fluid"
      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: B) High protein in pleural fluid Explanation: High protein content in pleural fluid is a key criterion in Light's Criteria for distinguishing exudative from transudative pleural effusions. An exudative pleural effusion occurs due to inflammation or infections such as bacterial pneumonia, malignancy, or viral infection, while transudative pleural effusion results from an imbalance between hydrostatic and osmotic pressures. According to Light's Criteria, an effusion is considered exudative when the pleural fluid protein/serum protein ratio is >0.5 , pleural fluid LDH/serum LDH >0.6 , or pleural fluid LDH >2/3 of the upper limit in serum . At least one of these criteria must be met to classify an effusion as exudative. Pleural fluid Analysis Light's Criteria Differentiates transudative from exudative pleural effusions based on LDH and protein levels in pleural fluid. An exudative pleural effusion meets at least one of the following: Pleural fluid protein/serum protein > 0.5 Pleural fluid LDH/serum LDH > 0.6 Pleural fluid LDH exceeds two-thirds of the normal upper limit for serum. ~25% of transudates may be misidentified as exudates. If exudative criteria are met but a transudative condition is suspected, measure protein difference; if >31 g/L (3.1 g/dL), likely transudative. Low protein in pleural fluid (Option A) : Low protein content is actually characteristic of transudative pleural effusions, not exudative effusions. Transudates occur due to systemic conditions like heart failure or cirrhosis where there is an imbalance in hydrostatic pressures. Low sugar in pleural fluid (Option C) : While pleural fluid glucose levels may be measured in certain conditions, sugar content is not a criterion used to differentiate between exudative and transudative effusions. Glucose levels may be low in specific conditions like empyema or rheumatoid effusions, but this is not a distinguishing feature between transudates and exudates. High sugar in pleural fluid (Option D) : Sugar levels in pleural fluid are not part of Light's Criteria and are not used to distinguish between exudative and transudative effusions. Pleural fluid glucose measurement may be helpful in specific clinical scenarios but is not a determining factor in the basic classification of effusions.

      "correct_answer": "D",
      "explanation": "symptoms and spirometry results, the patient is likely experiencing persistent mild asthma . The FEV1 ranging from 70% to 83% suggests some airflow limitation, and nighttime symptoms occurring twice a week indicate inadequate control of asthma. Management: Inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) are the mainstay of treatment for persistent asthma. They reduce inflammation and help prevent exacerbations. Given the frequency of nighttime symptoms, it is necessary to step up the treatment from just using a short-acting beta-agonist (like albuterol) as needed. Incorrect Options: Option A - Continue with albuterol : This is insufficient for managing persistent asthma. Albuterol is a short-acting bronchodilator used for quick relief, not for long-term control. Option B - Replace with salmeterol twice daily : Salmeterol is a long-acting beta-agonist (LABA) and should not be used alone without an ICS because it does not address the underlying inflammation and can increase the risk of asthma-related death.

Bronchodilators Use nebulised short-acting β 2-agonists (e.g., salbutamol, terbutaline) with anticholinergics (e.g., ipratropium). If oxygen sensitivity is a concern, use compressed air for nebulisation. Glucocorticoids Administer oral prednisolone (30 mg for 10 days) to reduce symptoms and improve lung function.Reduces frequency and severity of exacerbations. Consider osteoporosis prophylaxis for repeated courses. Antibiotic Therapy Indicated for increased sputum purulence, volume, or breathlessness.

Non-Invasive Ventilation (NIV) Safe for mild to moderate respiratory acidosis; helps reduce intubation need and mortality. Not suitable for patients unable to protect their airway. Mechanical Ventilation Consider if there is a reversible cause, no prior respiratory failure, or if NIV has failed/contraindicated. Decisions should involve the patient, family, and GP. Additional Therapy Diuretics for peripheral oedema. Limited evidence for intravenous aminophylline; consider arrhythmia risk. Doxapram may be used short-term for low respiratory rates.

Increasing tidal volume (Option B) can lead to an increased risk of ventilator-induced lung injury (VILI) and barotrauma. It is generally recommended to use lower tidal volumes (around 6 mL/kg of ideal body weight) in ARDS to minimize complications. Increasing respiratory rate (Option C) may improve minute ventilation but does not directly address the issue of hypoxemia. It is not the ideal intervention to improve oxygenation in ARDS.

      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer B- Cystic fibrosis Cystic fibrosis is identified as the primary diagnosis based on the classical triad of symptoms presented. The diagnosis is supported by the presence of recurrent respiratory infections with thickened sputum (indicating pulmonary involvement), bronchial wall thickening on chest X-ray , and steatorrhea since birth (indicating pancreatic insufficiency). The condition is characterized by a genetic defect in the CFTR gene affecting chloride channels , resulting in thick secretions in multiple organ systems.

Malabsorption syndrome (Option D) typically presents with steatorrhea, diarrhea, weight loss & various nutrient deficiencies but does not account for the specific respiratory manifestations present in this case. The combination of respiratory and gastrointestinal symptoms points more specifically to cystic fibrosis.

CT-guided biopsy is the most appropriate next step given the peripheral location of the mass near the apex of the lung . It is a minimally invasive procedure where a radiologist uses CT imaging to guide the insertion of a needle into the lung mass to obtain a tissue sample for analysis.

      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer B - Silicosis Silicosis , a progressive occupational interstitial lung disease caused by inhalation of crystalline silica dust . On HRCT, silicosis characteristically shows ground-glass opacities, particularly in early stages . The ground-glass appearance on HRCT refers to an imaging pattern in which the lung parenchyma appears hazy due to partial filling of the air spaces with fluid, inflammatory cells, or fibrosis. They appear as hazy areas of increased attenuation in the lung parenchyma without obscuring the underlying bronchial and vascular margins. As the disease progresses, nodular opacities called silicotic nodules develop, typically with an upper lung zone predominance, and may calcify over time, resulting in eggshell calcifications. Silicosis: Leading cause of Interstitial lung disease (ILD) in India , frequently resulting from occupational exposure in the glassware, mining, quarrying, and construction industries. Manifests after 10-20 years of continuous exposure. Radiological features: The chest radiograph may show profuse military infiltration or consolidation, and there is a characteristic HRCT pattern of ground glass opacitities known as “crazy paving” . Multiple well-circumscribed 3–5 mm nodular opacities predominantly in the mid-and upper zones. Enlargement of the hilar glands with an “egg-shell” pattern of calcification (seen in 20% of cases). As the disease progresses, progressive massive fibrosis (PMF) may develop. Asbestosis (Option A): Asbestosis is a chronic lung disease caused by the inhalation of asbestos fibers. The characteristic findings on HRCT include linear opacities that typically have a subpleural and lower lung zone predominance, with fine reticular lines, thick bands, or honeycombing. Ground-glass appearance is not a typical feature of asbestosis. Anthracosis (Option C): Anthracosis, or coal workers' pneumoconiosis, is caused by the inhalation and deposition of coal dust particles. The primary HRCT finding is the presence of small, rounded opacities, often referred to as coal macules or coal nodules found in the upper lung zones. Ground-glass opacities are not a characteristic feature. Bagassosis (Option D): Bagassosis is an acute hypersensitivity pneumonitis caused by the inhalation of moldy bagasse. While HRCT findings in bagassosis can vary, they typically include centrilobular nodules and air-trapping. While ground-glass opacities may be seen, they are not the predominant or characteristic feature.

      "explanation": "Correct Answer: A) Pancoast tumor This patient's clinical presentation, combined with the findings from the chest X-ray, points towards the Pancoast tumor, a form of lung cancer that occurs in the apex (upper part) of the lung. Pancoast Tumor: A Pancoast tumor, also known as a superior sulcus tumor, is a type of lung cancer that arises in the apex of the lung, often extending to involve nearby structures, including the chest wall, nerves, and blood vessels. These tumors are typically non-small cell lung cancers (NSCLC), most commonly squamous cell carcinoma or adenocarcinoma, strongly associated with smoking, which is a major risk factor. Clinical Presentation The symptoms of a Pancoast tumor are primarily due to the tumor's location rather than systemic effects of lung cancer. Pain: Severe shoulder, arm, or chest wall pain is common due to invasion of the brachial plexus (C8-T2 nerve roots). Horner's Syndrome: Results from sympathetic chain involvement, characterized by: Ptosis (drooping eyelid) Miosis (pupil constriction) Anhidrosis (loss of sweating on the affected side) Weakness and Atrophy: Weakness of the hand muscles and atrophy, due to compression of the lower brachial plexus.

      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: A) Inadequately compensated respiratory acidosis Explanation: pH 7.28 is decreased, suggestive of acidosis, the pCO 2 = 60mmHg which is elevated, hence the acidosis is likely respiratory. The bicarbonate is 28 meq/L implying that compensation is partial (partial compensation/inadequate compensation) This is a case of inadequately compensated respiratory acidosis because: In acute respiratory acidosis, HCO 3 - will ↑ by 1 mEq/L for every 10 mmHg ↑ in pCO 2 In chronic respiratory acidosis, HCO 3 - will ↑ by 4 mEq/L for every 10 mmHg ↑ in pCO 2 In this patient, ABG shows: pH: 7.28 PaCO 2 : 60 mmHg HCO 3 -: 28 mEq/L Normal PaCO 2 : 38-42 mm Hg Thus, the difference in PaCO 2 = 60 - 42 = 18 mm Hg As this patient has COPD which is the most likely cause of respiratory acidosis in this patient, it is chronic respiratory acidosis We know for every 10 mmHg ↑ in PCO 2 , HCO 3 - should ↑ by 4 mEq/L For 1 mmHg ↑ in PCO 2 , HCO 3 - should ↑ by 4 / 10 mEq/L Thus for 18 mm Hg ↑ in PCO 2 , HCO 3 - should ↑ by 7.2 mEq/L In this patient HCO 3 - should be approx 33 mEq/L, but it is only 28 mEq/L, hence it is only partially compensated respiratory acidosis Incorrect Options: Fully compensated respiratory acidosis (Option B): If this was the condition, the HCO 3 - should have been approximately 33. Fully compensated respiratory alkalosis (Option C) is incorrect since the ABG in the given scenario is respiratory acidosis. Inadequately compensated metabolic alkalosis (Option D) is incorrect since the ABG in the given scenario is respiratory acidosis.

In the outpatient setting, the most common pathogens causing CAP are typically atypical bacteria, such as Mycoplasma pneumoniae and Chlamydophila pneumoniae, as well as certain respiratory viruses. Azithromycin, a macrolide antibiotic, is commonly used as an empiric treatment option for CAP in the outpatient setting. Azithromycin has several advantages that make it suitable for outpatient management of CAP. It has excellent activity against atypical pathogens, including Mycoplasma pneumoniae and Chlamydophila pneumoniae. It also has a long half-life, allowing for once-daily dosing, which enhances patient compliance. Incorrect Options: Option A - Vancomycin: Vancomycin is an antibiotic primarily used for the treatment of Gram-positive bacterial infections, particularly those caused by methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). It is not typically used as an initial empiric treatment for community-acquired pneumonia in the outpatient setting. Option B - Ceftriaxone: Ceftriaxone is a broad-spectrum cephalosporin antibiotic commonly used for the treatment of various bacterial infections. While it may be used for the treatment of CAP in specific cases, such as when there is a concern for more resistant pathogens or in patients with specific risk factors, it is not the first-line treatment choice in most cases of outpatient CAP.

The FEV1 decreases more than the FVC , leading to a decreased FEV1/FVC ratio. This reduction indicates impaired airflow during expiration, resulting in increased residual volume in the lungs. Examples of obstructive lung diseases include asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and bronchiectasis. Incorrect Options: Option A - Restrictive disease: In restrictive lung diseases, the expansion of lung tissue is limited, resulting in reduced lung volumes. Restrictive lung diseases typically do not cause a significant reduction in the FEV1/FVC ratio. Instead, both FEV1 and FVC are proportionally reduced, maintaining a relatively normal FEV1/FVC ratio or even slightly increased. Examples of restrictive lung diseases include pulmonary fibrosis, interstitial lung disease, and chest wall deformities.
