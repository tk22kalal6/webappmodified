      "question": "A 35 y/o male presents with exertional dyspnea and palpitations during sports activities. His family history is significant for a relative who experienced sudden cardiac death at a young age. In managing this patient with suspected hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy (HOCM), which of the following is a first-line treatment option to relieve symptoms?",

      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "β -Adrenergic blocking agent is the first-line treatment for conditions such as hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy (HOCM), effectively reducing heart rate and improving diastolic filling, thereby alleviating symptoms like exertional dyspnea and palpitations. Treatment of HOCM Medical Management First-line Medications: β -Adrenergic Blocking Agents (e.g., Metaprolol): Reduce heart rate and improve diastolic filling. L-type Calcium Channel Blockers (e.g., Verapamil): Help decrease contractility and relieve outflow obstruction. Additional Therapy for Persistent Symptoms: Disopyramide: An antiarrhythmic agent with negative inotropic properties to control exertional dyspnea and chest pain. Surgical and Procedural Options Surgical Myectomy: Effective in relieving outflow tract obstruction by excising part of the septal myocardium. Alcohol Septal Ablation: Suitable for patients with appropriate coronary anatomy; involves controlled infarction to relieve obstruction. Primarily for patients who prefer to avoid surgery or have comorbidities. Risk Stratification and Management for Sudden Cardiac Death (SCD) in Hypertrophic Obstructive Cardiomyopathy (HOCM) Increased Risk for SCD: HOCM patients are at heightened risk for sudden cardiac death, primarily from ventricular tachyarrhythmias. Physical Activity Guidelines: Traditional prohibitions against vigorous exercise are under reconsideration in ongoing studies. Implantable Cardioverter-Defibrillator (ICD) Recommendations: Indications Recommended for patients with two or more risk factors for SCD. Considered selectively for those with one risk factor. Strongly indicated for patients who have previously survived cardiac arrest due to ventricular fibrillation or sustained ventricular tachycardia. High-Risk Features for Primary Prevention Unexplained syncope Abnormal blood pressure response during exercise Significant ventricular hypertrophy (>30mm thickness) Family history of SCD Multiple episodes of non-sustained ventricular tachycardia (NSVT) Enalapril (Option A) and Candesartan (Option C) which are ACE inhibitors and Angiotensin receptor Blockers respectively are contraindicated in the management of HOCM. Surgical Myomectomy (Option D) is a surgical intervention reserved for patients with severe symptoms who do not respond to medical management, not a first-line treatment.",

      "explanation": "of ST-segment elevation without reciprocal depression, and \"takotsubo\" ballooning on echocardiography, points to Takotsubo cardiomyopathy, also known as stress cardiomyopathy. This condition is often triggered by emotional or physical stress, mimicking acute coronary syndrome without coronary artery obstruction. Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy (Broken Heart syndrome) Yamaguchi Syndrome (Apical Hypertrophic Cardiomyopathy) Definition: Takotsubo cardiomyopathy, or stress cardiomyopathy, is a transient condition characterized by left ventricular apical ballooning often triggered by emotional or physical stress, mimicking acute coronary syndrome without coronary obstruction. Epidemiology : Predominantly affects postmenopausal women, triggered by emotional or physical stress. Clinical Presentation : Chest pain, signs of acute heart failure, resembling acute coronary syndrome. ECG : ST-segment elevation, absent reciprocal depression, T-wave inversion, mild QT prolongation. Biochemistry : Elevated catecholamines, BNP, and modest troponin rise. Imaging : Echocardiography : Classic \"takotsubo\" ballooning of the left ventricular apex, with basal segments hyperdynamic and apex hypokinetic. Can show left ventricular outflow tract obstruction or mitral regurgitation. MRI : Apical ballooning with high T2 intensity (oedema), typically sparing the basal segments. No late enhancement, differentiating it from anterior STEMI. Left Ventriculography : Demonstrates transient dysfunction and ballooning of mid and apical segments of the left ventricle. Prognosis : Excellent recovery with supportive treatment, typically resolves in weeks to months. Definition : A rare form of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy affecting the left ventricle's apex, occasionally the right or both. Epidemiology : More common in Japanese populations (15-25% of HCM cases) compared to the U.S. (~3%). Symptoms : Often asymptomatic; possible symptoms include chest pain, palpitations, dyspnea, and syncope. ECG Findings : Left ventricular hypertrophy with deep negative T waves, especially in leads V4-V5. Pathology : Usually sporadic, with occasional autosomal dominant inheritance. Imaging : \"Ace-of-spades\" or \"spade-like\" left ventricle configuration on imaging configuration on ventriculogram\" data-author=\"A. PayusFarisha SholehN.

      "explanation": "autoimmune response to antigens from the injured myocardium following surgery. Post-cardiac injury syndrome Definition : Postcardiac Injury Syndrome is acute pericarditis triggered by prior injury to the heart, leading to blood in the pericardial cavity. Causes : Can follow cardiac surgery, trauma, catheterization, or occasionally a myocardial infarction. Symptoms : Sharp chest pain (mimicking viral/idiopathic pericarditis), fever, pleuritis, and pneumonitis, typically appearing 1–4 weeks after injury. Recurrences can happen over several years. Pathophysiology : Likely due to an autoimmune reaction against myocardial/pericardial antigens. Treatment : Usually self-limiting; managed with aspirin or NSAIDs. Severe or recurring cases may require colchicine or glucocorticoids. Bacterial pericarditis (Option A) : Unlikely, as it typically presents sooner after surgery and with signs of sepsis. Direct trauma from the procedure (Option C) : Less likely, as trauma-related pain would generally occur immediately post-surgery, not weeks later. Viral infection (Option D) : Unlikely, as viral pericarditis is not typically related to recent cardiac surgery or triggered by myocardial antigens.

The echocardiogram findings further support this diagnosis, showing normal systolic function with evidence of diastolic dysfunction. In patients with RCM, particularly those with amyloidosis, you can also observe specific signs like rapid Y descents in jugular venous pressure, which is consistent with the heart's impaired ability to fill.

      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "athletes, especially in those with a family history of sudden death, like this patient. The symptoms of dizziness and palpitations during training strongly suggest HCM. Sudden Cardiac Death (SCD) Sudden Cardiac Death (SCD) is defined as unexpected death occurring within an hour of symptom onset due to cardiac causes, including unwitnessed deaths in individuals who seemed healthy within the last 24 hours. Risk Factors Structural Heart Disease: The presence of structural heart issues or inherited arrhythmia syndromes significantly increases SCD risk. Major Risk Factors: Coronary Heart Disease (CHD) Heart Failure Diabetes Hypertension Smoking Family History of SCD Precipitating Factors SCD and Sudden Cardiac Arrest (SCA) frequently occur at specific times (e.g., mornings, winter months) and in public places. Vigorous exertion, especially in men, can trigger SCD; however, regular exercise may reduce this risk. Underlying Heart Disease The most common cause of SCD is Ventricular fibrillation Many SCD cases are linked to coronary artery disease (CAD), but non-ischemic cardiomyopathies and other heart conditions also contribute. Common mechanisms leading to SCD include: Acute Myocardial Infarction Bradyarrhythmias Ventricular scars leading to arrhythmias Commotio Cordis Commotio cordis is a specific cause of SCD, often resulting from an impact to the left chest by a hard object, such as a baseball, during sports. This can induce ventricular fibrillation and cardiac arrest in an otherwise structurally normal heart. (Option B ruled out) SCD in Athletes Younger Athletes: The leading causes of SCD are inherited cardiac conditions, particularly Hypertrophic Cardiomyopathy (HCM). Older Athletes: Risks are primarily associated with atherosclerotic coronary artery disease (CAD). Arrhythmogenic Right Ventricular Cardiomyopathy (ARVC): ARVC is recognised as a cause of ventricular tachycardia and SCD in young athletes, characterized by: Progressive fibrofatty replacement of the right ventricle Familial transmission Symptomatic arrhythmias Young athletes with ARVC may exhibit symptoms such as palpitations, dizziness, and unexplained syncope. Valvular heart disease (Option C) and Atherosclerotic coronary artery disease (Option D) are less likely to be the cause in a young, fit athlete.

In HOCM , the left ventricular outflow tract (LVOT) obstruction worsens when the heart is under-filled (low preload) or when the heart has to contract more forcefully. Low preload results in reduced end-diastolic volume, exacerbating outflow obstruction due to a narrower channel. Increased contractility raises blood flow across the outflow tract, causing greater anterior displacement of the mitral leaflet, further obstructing the LVOT. This is why certain drugs are contraindicated in HOCM, as they can exacerbate the obstruction. Drugs contraindicated in Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. Nitroglycerin: It causes vasodilation , which reduces preload. Furosemide: It causes diuresis, which leads to a reduction in blood volume hence a decrease in preload. (Option C ruled out) Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors : ACE inhibitors reduce afterload (the resistance the heart must pump against) and can also reduce preload by causing vasodilation and decreasing blood volume. Angiotensin receptor blockers: ARBs work similarly to ACE inhibitors by reducing afterload and preload .

Double Impulse at the Apex A palpable fourth heart sound suggests forceful atrial contraction against a non-compliant ventricle. (Option A ruled out) Mid-Systolic Murmur at the Base Turbulent blood flow through the obstructed left ventricular outflow tract produces a mid-systolic murmur. Pansystolic Murmur at the Apex Indicates mitral regurgitation caused by abnormal systolic anterior motion of the mitral valve. Jerky Arterial Pulse Characteristic of HOCM, contrasts with the slow-rising pulse seen in aortic stenosis. Pulsus bisferiens (Option C ruled out) A double pulse noticed during systole in the peripheral pulse is called pulsus bisferiens.

Left ventricular outflow tract obstruction is the hallmark of HOCM caused by asymmetric septal hypertrophy leading to dynamic obstruction during systole, which explains his effort-related symptoms and murmur. Hypertrophic Obstructive Cardiomyopathy (HOCM) Pathophysiology: Autosomal dominant disorder (a genetic disorder). Mutations : Beta-myosin heavy-chain : Leads to significant ventricular hypertrophy. Troponin : Minimal hypertrophy but associated with myocardial fibre disarray and sudden death. Myosin-binding protein C : Often presents later in life; linked to hypertension and arrhythmias. Key Characteristics : Inappropriate, extensive left ventricular hypertrophy. Misaligned myocardial fibres (helter skelter disarray) and myocardial fibrosis. A rigid left ventricle impedes diastolic filling, leading to heart failure. Dynamic left ventricular outflow tract obstruction (LVOTO) due to septal hypertrophy. Mitral regurgitation due to systolic anterior motion of the mitral valve. Clinical Features: Effort-Related Symptoms : Angina : Due to increased myocardial oxygen demand during exertion. Dyspnoea : Resulting from impaired diastolic filling and inefficient LV function. Syncope : Caused by reduced cardiac output during exertion. Sudden Death : The most common cause of sudden death in HOCM is ventricular fibrillation.High risk during intense physical activity, especially in young athletes. Distinct Pulse Characteristics : Jerky arterial pulse, distinguishing it from aortic stenosis . Diastolic heart failure due to a dilated left ventricle (Option A) : HOCM involves hypertrophy, not dilation, of the left ventricle. Mitral valve prolapse (Option B) : Not characteristic of HOCM ; instead, the systolic anterior motion of the mitral valve may lead to mitral regurgitation .

Immediate fluid resuscitation is critical to restore circulating blood volume while managing the active bleeding. Hypovolemic and Obstructive Shock: Aspect Hypovolemic Shock Obstructive Shock Definition Critical blood loss leads to inadequate organ perfusion. Obstruction of blood flow, impairing the heart's ability to pump blood. Causes Traumatic injuries (deep lacerations, internal bleeding) from crashes. Injuries like tension pneumothorax, and cardiac tamponade in crashes. Symptoms Dizziness, rapid heartbeat, cold skin, pale lips, nausea, confusion. Rapid heartbeat, difficulty breathing, cold skin, anxiety. Pathophysiology Initial compensation fails, leading to low blood pressure, and multi-organ failure. Physical blockage reduces oxygen delivery to organs. Treatment Volume resuscitation (IV fluids, blood transfusions), control bleeding. Relieve obstruction (needle decompression, pericardiocentesis), and fluid resuscitation. Administer intravenous antibiotics (Option A) : While necessary in trauma cases to prevent infection, it is not the priority in acute shock management. Perform an urgent CT scan (Option B) : Imaging is important for diagnosis but should be deferred until the patient is stabilised. Apply a tourniquet to the thigh (Option D) : This can be used if bleeding is not controlled by direct pressure, but fluid resuscitation is the immediate priority.

      "explanation": "systolic blood pressure during inspiration (greater than 10 mm Hg). It occurs due to the impaired filling of the heart chambers caused by pericardial fluid compression, limiting cardiac output during inspiration. This phenomenon is commonly observed in cardiac tamponade and serves as a key diagnostic feature in such cases. Cardiac Tamponade Definition A condition where the cardiac chambers are compressed by a tense pericardial effusion, limiting cardiac inflow. Fluid accumulation of as little as 200 ml to upwards of 2L may lead to cardiac tamponade development. Clinical Features Beck's triad Jugular Venous Distension : Due to increased central venous pressure. Prominent x descent and an absent y descent. Hypotension : Resulting from impaired cardiac output. Muffled Heart Sounds : Caused by fluid accumulation in the pericardial space, dampening heart sounds. Other features Pulsus Paradoxus : A drop in systolic BP during inspiration, greater than 10 mm Hg. Causes of Pulsus paradoxus: Lung Conditions: Acute asthma, COPD, tension pneumothorax, pleural effusion, pulmonary embolism. Heart Conditions: Cardiac tamponade, constrictive pericarditis. Low-Pressure Cardiac Tamponade Definition This occurs when lower pericardial pressure leads to tamponade, often in cases of intravascular fluid depletion (e.g., hypovolemia). Features Jugular Venous Distension: Often absent Pulsus Paradoxus: Rare Requires a high degree of suspicion due to the absence of typical signs like jugular venous distension and pulsus paradoxus. S3 heart sound (Option B): An S3 heart sound, also known as a ventricular gallop, is typically associated with heart failure or conditions causing rapid filling of the ventricles, such as dilated cardiomyopathy. It is not a classic finding in cardiac tamponade, which is more characterized by restricted ventricular filling and muffled heart sounds rather than additional heart sounds like S3. Pulsus alternans (Option C): Pulsus alternans refers to alternating strong and weak pulse beats, typically seen in left ventricular dysfunction, not cardiac tamponade.

      "explanation": "such as azathioprine can be considered. Azathioprine is used for patients with recurrent, refractory pericarditis who have multiple episodes lasting for extended periods. Acute Pericarditis Investigations Treatment Echocardiography : The primary tool for diagnosing pericardial fluid. Significant pericardial effusion can be identified if fluid exceeds 1 cm. CT & MRI : Detect loculated effusions, masses, or inflammation (MRI) Used to confirm pericardial effusion or thickening. MRI also assesses fibrosis and constrictive pericarditis. Conservative Management: Rest and anti-inflammatory drugs for idiopathic pericarditis. Aspirin/NSAIDs : Doses: Aspirin (2-4 g/day) or ibuprofen/indomethacin with gastric protection. Continue for 1-2 weeks, and taper over time. Colchicine : Dose: 0.5 mg daily (<70 kg) or twice daily (>70 kg) for 3 months. Reduces recurrence risk but may cause diarrhoea. Glucocorticoids : Only for NSAID/colchicine-resistant cases, short-term use (2-4 days), then tapered. Prolonged use raises the recurrence risk. Immunosuppressants : Azathioprine or anakinra in cases of frequent recurrence is unresponsive to other treatments. Avoid Anticoagulants : Risk of bleeding into the pericardial cavity, leading to tamponade. Surgical: Pericardial stripping for rare, severe cases with recurrent effusion. Increase the dose of NSAIDs (Option A): NSAIDs are effective for inflammation control in the short term, but increasing the dosage does not provide additional benefit once recurrences occur. Begin a higher dose of colchicine (Option C): Increasing the dose beyond the recommended levels is not advisable, as colchicine has a narrow therapeutic window . Higher doses increase the risk of gastrointestinal side effects, such as diarrhoea, and can be toxic, especially in patients with liver or kidney problems. Stop all medications and monitor (Option D): Stopping all medications without an alternative treatment plan is not appropriate in recurrent pericarditis cases. It can lead to persistent discomfort and potential complications. Reference: Harrison’s Principles of Internal Medicine, 21st Edition, Page 1853, 2020, 2021",
