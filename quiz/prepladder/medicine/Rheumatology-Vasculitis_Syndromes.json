      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Correct answer: B) Start prednisone 40-60 mg/day immediately Explanation: The symptoms of new-onset headache, jaw claudication, and visual symptoms point towards Giant Cell Arteritis Treatment should not be delayed pending diagnostic studies Initial therapy is prednisone 40-60 mg/day for ~1 month Early treatment is crucial to prevent vision loss Temporal artery biopsy can remain positive for ~14 days after starting steroids GCA: Diagnostic Approach: 1. Clinical Features + Labs: Age >50 years Fever, anemia, high ESR/CRP Headache, jaw claudication Vision symptoms 2. Confirmatory Tests: Temporal artery biopsy (3-5 cm segment) Serial sectioning due to patchy involvement Ultrasonography of the temporal artery Vascular imaging (MR/CT) for large vessel involvement 3. Laboratory Findings: Elevated ESR and CRP Normochromic/hypochromic anemia Elevated alkaline phosphatase Increased IgG and complement Treatment Protocol: 1. Initial Management: Prednisone 40-60 mg/day immediately for 1 month IV methylprednisolone 1000 mg daily for 3 days if ocular symptoms Aspirin 81 mg daily to reduce cranial ischemic complications 2. Additional Therapies: Tocilizumab (anti-IL-6) FDA approved Given as 162 mg SC weekly/biweekly with steroids Methotrexate as alternative steroid-sparing agent 3. Monitoring: Treatment typically needed for ≥ 2 years ESR/CRP useful for monitoring 60-85% have symptom recurrence during tapering Watch for glucocorticoid toxicity (35-65% of patients) Waiting for a biopsy before starting any treatment (Option A) is incorrect as it risks permanent vision loss Begin methotrexate and low-dose aspirin (Option C): Methotrexate is not first-line therapy; it's used as a steroid-sparing agent in select cases Start Tocilizumab alone (Option D) is used in combination with steroids, not as monotherapy Reference: Harrison’s Principles of Internal Medicine, 21st Edition, Volume I, Page. 2812",

      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Correct answer: B) IgA vasculitis (Henoch-Schönlein purpura) Explanation: From the given clinical scenario, IgA vasculitis will be the most likely diagnosis. Age group (4-7 years), classic palpable purpura with lower extremity predominance, post-infectious trigger (upper respiratory infection), associated symptoms (abdominal pain, arthralgias), and symmetric distribution of rash point out to IgA vasculitis. IgA vasculitis (Henoch-Schönlein purpura): IgA vasculitis is the most common vasculitis in children Pathogenesis involves IgA immune complex deposition in small blood vessels, especially in the skin, gastrointestinal tract, kidneys, and joints. The deposited IgA immune complexes activate the alternative complement pathway. Complement activation promotes inflammation, causing recruitment of neutrophils and other inflammatory cells, which release cytokines and proteolytic enzymes. Clinical features: Classic tetrad- Palpable purpura (100%): Vascular inflammation causes palpable purpura. Arthralgia (75%): Inflammation leads to joint pain and swelling, although typically self-limiting. Abdominal pain (70%): Vasculitis of intestinal vessels can cause abdominal pain, bleeding, and intussusception. Renal involvement (10-50%): Immune complex deposition in the glomeruli leads to glomerulonephritis, presenting with hematuria and sometimes proteinuria. Usually self-limiting but requires monitoring for renal complications More common in males (1.5:1) with a peak incidence in spring IgA vasculitis (Henoch-Schönlein purpura\" data-author=\"Ajd52\" data-hash=\"8750\" data-license=\"CC BY-SA 3.0\" data-source=\"https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Plamica_w_zespole_Henocha-Schonleina.JPG\" data-tags=\"\" height=\"336\" src=\"https://image.prepladder.com/notes/9IvuRJ8aS9FqEjByozGC1744301623.png\" width=\"446\" /> ITP (Option A): It presents with non-palpable purpura, mucosal bleeding, low platelet count, and no systemic symptoms like joint pain or abdominal pain. Meningococcemia (Option C): It presents acutely with a toxic appearance, rapidly progressive petechiae/purpura, associated with high fever and meningeal signs, not symmetric in distribution. Kawasaki disease (Option D): It presents with polymorphous rash (not purpuric), characteristic mucosal changes, cervical lymphadenopathy, and coronary artery involvement.

      "explanation": "Correct answer: A) Renal biopsy is essential for confirming the diagnosis Explanation: The diagnosis of IgA vasculitis (HSP) is primarily based on clinical signs and symptoms. Renal biopsy is rarely needed. Henoch Schonlein Purpura: Diagnostic Criteria Presence of two or more of the following: Palpable purpura without thrombocytopenia Patient 20 years or younger at disease onset Bowel angina (diffuse abdominal pain or diagnosis of bowel ischemia) The biopsy showed granulocytes in the walls of small arterioles or venules, and IgA deposits were found in the vessel wall. Lab Findings Normal complement (Option D ruled out). This is an important distinguishing feature from some other vasculitis. Normal platelets Elevated IgA in ~50% Mild leukocytosis Skin biopsy can confirm (shows leukocytoclastic vasculitis with IgA and C3 deposition) Renal biopsy is rarely needed (Option A) Treatment Often self-limiting Glucocorticoids (1 mg/kg/day prednisone): (Option B ruled out) Helpful for: edema, joint pain, abdominal pain Not proven for skin/renal disease (Option C ruled out) Reference: Harrison’s Principles of Internal Medicine, 21st Edition, Volume I, Page. 2813, 2814",

      "correct_answer": "D",
      "explanation": "Correct answer: D) Panarteritis with intimal proliferation; start prednisone Explanation: The patient presents with Takayasu Arteritis . Pathology: Pan-arteritis with intimal proliferation Initial treatment: glucocorticoids (40-60mg prednisone/day) Controls acute inflammation before considering surgery Takayasu Arteritis (\"Pulseless disease\"): General features: Predominantly affects young females (<20 years) Vascular Involvement: A leading cause of renal artery stenosis in India Most commonly affects the left subclavian artery Characteristic ostial narrowing vs. diffuse involvement in atherosclerosis Clinical Features: a) Early Phase (Pre-pulseless): Systemic symptoms: fever, malaise, night sweats Arthralgias, anorexia, weight loss b) Vascular Phase: Arm claudication Unequal blood pressure between arms Pulseless disease (difficult to appreciate radial artery) Hypertension (32-93%) Differential Diagnosis: Young female with renal artery stenosis: India: Think Takayasu arteritis USA: Think fibromuscular dysplasia (FMD) Arm claudication: Rule out neurogenic claudication (cervical disc disease) Investigations: ESR/CRP elevation Mild anemia Elevated immunoglobulins Investigation of choice: MR angiography (MRA) Complete imaging of the aorta and major branches needed Management: First Line: Steroids (40-60mg prednisone/day) Second Line: Methotrexate ( up to 25mg/week) for steroid-refractory cases Important Points for Differential Blood Pressure: Normal difference between arm-leg BP: <20 mmHg Conditions with unequal arm BPs: Takayasu arteritis Supravalvular aortic stenosis with Coanda effect Preductal coarctation of aorta Major complications: Heart failure, stroke, MI, aneurysm rupture, renal failure Primarily intimal disease; start anti-TNF therapy (Option A): The disease affects all layers, not just intima. Anti-TNF therapy isn't first-line and lacks randomized trial validation. Panarteritis; tocilizumab superior to steroids (Option B): While panarteritis is correct, Tocilizumab failed to show superiority in randomized trials. Adventitial inflammation; methotrexate first-line (Option C): Not limited to adventitia; affects all vessel layers. Methotrexate is the second-line for steroid-refractory cases.

      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Correct answer: C) Throat culture is essential for diagnosis and Penicillin is the treatment of choice strawberry tongue, and sandpaper rash. Throat culture for group A streptococcus is diagnostic Penicillin is the treatment of choice to prevent complications This is primarily a toxin-mediated process from GAS (Group A Streptococci) infection Differentials of strawberry tongue with skin rash and fever: Feature Kawasaki’s Disease Scarlet Fever Cause Etiology unknown; Likely Immune-Mediated. Group A Streptococcus infection (Streptococcal pyrogenic exotoxins A, B, C). Age Group Affected It primarily affects children, 80% of cases in children ≤ 5 years old, Peak incidence at ≤ 2 years. Most common in children aged 2–10 years, usually following Group A streptococcal pharyngitis. Main Symptoms Based on fever lasting ≥ 5 days + ≥ 4 of 5 principal criteria: Fever ≥ 5 days Bilateral conjunctival injection (red eyes) Oral mucosal changes (strawberry tongue, red lips) Rash (polymorphous) Extremity changes (swelling, redness, peeling) Fever, Pharyngitis, Headache, Characteristic rash with a sandpaper-like texture , beginning on the face, spreading to the trunk and extremities, sparing palms and soles, followed by desquamation. Circumoral pallor, and Strawberry tongue. Other Symptoms Coronary artery aneurysms, myocarditis, pericarditis, myocardial ischemia, infarction, cardiomegaly. Rash accentuates in skin folds (Pastia’s lines) , desquamation in the second week. Complications Coronary Artery Aneurysms Myocardial Infarction Thrombosis Vasculitis. Rheumatic Fever Post-Streptococcal Glomerulonephritis Diagnostic method Diagnosis is clinical based on criteria and confirmed by echocardiogram for coronary artery changes. Throat culture or RADT (Rapid Antigen Detection Test) for Group A Streptococcus confirmation. Treatment High-dose IV Immunoglobulin and Aspirin to reduce coronary artery complications. In severe cases, surgical intervention may be required (e.g., coronary artery bypass grafting). Antibiotics (penicillin or amoxicillin), Supportive care for fever and throat pain. IVIG with high-dose aspirin is the first-line treatment (Option A) is incorrect as this is the treatment for Kawasaki disease, not scarlet fever. The rash begins over the face and shows circumoral erythema (Option B): In scarlet fever, circumoral pallor (not erythema) is characteristic. Coronary artery involvement in most untreated cases (Option D) is a feature of Kawasaki disease, not scarlet fever.

      "question": "A 3-year-old boy presents with 6 days of fever, bilateral conjunctivitis, strawberry tongue, and polymorphous rash. Initial labs show elevated CRP, ESR, and thrombocytosis. Which of the following represents the most appropriate initial diagnostic test and treatment strategy?",
      "options": {
        "A": "Blood culture and broad-spectrum antibiotics",
        "B": "Echocardiogram and IVIG 2g/kg plus high-dose aspirin",
        "C": "Throat culture and penicillin",
        "D": "Viral panel and supportive care"
      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Correct answer: B) Echocardiogram and IVIG 2g/kg plus high-dose aspirin Explanation: This patient presents with classic features of Kawasaki Disease (KD) including: Fever for >= 5 days + 4 out of 5 criteria (CREAM) C : Conjunctivitis (bilateral, non-purulent) R : Rash (polymorphous) E : Extremity changes (swelling, redness, peeling) A : Adenopathy (cervical >1.5cm) M : Mucosal changes (strawberry tongue) Echocardiogram and IVIG 2g/kg plus high-dose aspirin (Option B) is the correct treatment because: Echocardiogram is essential for baseline assessment of coronary arteries and identifying any early aneurysm formation IVIG 2g/kg must be given within 10 days of fever onset to reduce risk of coronary artery aneurysms from 25% to 3-5% High-dose aspirin (80-100mg/kg/day) is indicated during the acute phase for its anti-inflammatory effects This combined approach represents the standard of care that has been proven to reduce cardiac complications Kawasaki Disease- Diagnosis & Treatment: Category Details Clinical Significance Initial Diagnostic Tests 1. Echocardiogram 2. Labs: - CRP (typically >3 mg/dL ) - ESR (typically >40 mm/hr ) - CBC: Leukocytosis >15,000 - Platelets >450,000 - Albumin <3.0 g/dL - E levated ALT - Sterile pyuria - Echo: baseline coronary status - ≥ 3 supplemental labs support diagnosis in incomplete KD - Helps differentiate from other febrile illnesses Initial Treatment 1 . IVIG: - 2g/kg single dose - Within 10 days of fever 2. Aspirin: - High-dose (80-100mg/kg/d) - Until afebrile 48h - Reduces aneurysm risk - IVIG resistance in 15-20% - Time-sensitive intervention Additional Therapy - Second IVIG dose if needed - Steroids in high-risk cases - Infliximab for refractory cases - Anticoagulation if aneurysms - Based on response - Risk stratification - Prevent complications Follow-up - Echo at 2 weeks - Echo at 6-8 weeks - Low-dose aspirin (3-5mg/kg/d) - Long-term cardiac monitoring - Monitor for aneurysms - Assess treatment response - Prevent thrombosis Blood culture and broad-spectrum antibiotics (Option A) is incorrect because bacterial infection is not the primary concern and antibiotics are not indicated. Throat culture and penicillin (Option C) is incorrect because streptococcal infection is not the likely diagnosis given the constellation of findings. Viral panel and supportive care (Option D) is incorrect because Kawasaki disease requires specific treatment, not just supportive care.

      "question": "A 40-year-old man with a history of asthma presents with worsening dyspnea, peripheral neuropathy, and palpable purpura on his lower limbs. He also has a history of sinusitis. Blood tests reveal marked eosinophilia and a positive p-ANCA. What is the most likely diagnosis?",

      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Correct answer: B) Churg-Strauss Syndrome Explanation: Churg-Strauss Syndrome aka Eosinophilic Granulomatosis with Polyangiitis (EGPA) is most commonly associated with a history of asthma , marked eosinophilia , and systemic vasculitis involving the skin, lungs, nerves, and sinuses. The positive p-ANCA result further supports the diagnosis Prodromal phase : Characterized by allergic rhinitis , nasal polyposis , and late-onset asthma , often difficult to control. Acute presentation : Triad : Skin lesions (purpura or nodules), asymmetric mononeuritis multiplex , and eosinophilia . Pulmonary involvement : Pulmonary infiltrates, pleural/pericardial effusions, and serositis may be seen. Abdominal symptoms in 50% due to mesenteric vasculitis . Lab Findings: Eosinophilia . Elevated ESR and CRP . ANCA (usually p-ANCA ) may be positive in up to 60% Biopsy: Small-vessel vasculitis with eosinophilic infiltration of the vessel walls. Management: Acute : High-dose glucocorticoids and cyclophosphamide. Maintenance : Low-dose glucocorticoids and azathioprine, methotrexate, or mycophenolate mofetil (MMF). Wegener's Granulomatosis (Granulomatosis with Polyangiitis) (Option A) : This vasculitis affects the upper and lower respiratory tract and kidneys but is more commonly associated with c-ANCA positivity, rather than p-ANCA. Additionally, patients with Wegener's typically do not have prominent eosinophilia, which is a hallmark of EGPA. Microscopic Polyangiitis (MPA) (Option C): This small-vessel vasculitis is typically associated with p-ANCA and necrotizing vasculitis, affecting organs like the kidneys and lungs. However, MPA does not present with the asthma or eosinophilia characteristic of EGPA. It is also not typically associated with palpable purpura. Polyarteritis Nodosa (PAN) (Option D) : PAN is a medium-vessel vasculitis that affects arteries, commonly leading to renal, gastrointestinal, and musculoskeletal involvement, but PAN does not typically present with eosinophilia, asthma, or p-ANCA. It is also not associated with the characteristic findings of pulmonary infiltrates seen in EGPA. Reference: Davidson's Principles and Practice of Medicine, 24th edition, Page 1043.",
