        "D": "30% is associated with Hepatitis B"
      },
      "correct_answer": "D",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: D) 30% is associated with Hepatitis B Explanation: 30% of polyarteritis nodosa is associated with Hepatitis B. Polyarteritis Nodosa: A multisystem, necrotizing vasculitis of small- and medium-sized muscular arteries. (Option A) Characteristically involves renal and visceral arteries. Kidneys: Arteritis without glomerulonephritis; glomerulosclerosis may be seen in hypertensive patients. Polyarteritis nodosa-like vasculitis may be seen in 30% of patients with hepatitis B , with circulating immune complexes composed of hepatitis B antigen and immunoglobulin. Pathology and Pathogenesis: Vascular lesion: Necrotizing inflammation of small- and medium-sized arteries. Lesions are segmental, involving bifurcations and branches of arteries. In acute stages: Polymorphonuclear neutrophils infiltrate vessel walls and perivascular areas, causing intimal proliferation and degeneration. In subacute and chronic stages: Mononuclear cells infiltrate, leading to fibrinoid necrosis, lumen compromise, thrombosis, infarction, and hemorrhage. Aneurysmal dilations up to 1 cm in size are characteristic. Clinical Manifestations: Nonspecific symptoms: Fever, weight loss, malaise, weakness, headache, abdominal pain, myalgias. Renal involvement: Hypertension, renal insufficiency, hemorrhage due to microaneurysms. Laboratory findings: Leukocytosis with neutrophil predominance (eosinophilia is rare). Anemia of chronic disease. Elevated ESR and CRP. Hypergammaglobulinemia may be present. (Option B) Hepatitis B and C screening is essential. ANCA is rarely present. (Option C) Diagnosis: Based on biopsy of involved organs (e.g., nodular skin lesions, painful testes, nerve/muscle) for vasculitis findings. Treatment: Prednisone and cyclophosphamide significantly improve survival. In patients with hepatitis B or C, antiviral therapy should be included along with glucocorticoids and plasma exchange.

        "A": "Pemphigus foliaceus",
        "B": "Pemphigus vulgaris",
        "C": "Dermatitis herpetiformis",
        "D": "Bullous pemphigoid"
      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: B) Pemphigus vulgaris Explanation: As the patient is presenting with flaccid bullous lesions involving the entire trunk and oral cavity, along with the presence of acantholytic cells on Tzanck smear, the most probable diagnosis would be Pemphigus vulgaris. However, a definitive diagnosis would require additional clinical evaluation, including a biopsy and direct immunofluorescence testing. Pemphigus vulgaris (PV): PV is the most common chronic autoimmune blistering disease caused by antibodies against desmosomal adhesion proteins. They are characterized by the presence of flaccid blisters filled with clear fluid present on normal skin or an erythematous base. The blisters rupture producing painful erosion. Mucosal involvement is a very important and one of the distinguishing features of PV. Histopathology: Intraepidermal cleavage with acantholysis (detached keratinocytes) primarily localized to the suprabasal region Separation of basal keratinocytes along the basement membrane zone, resulting in an appearance that resembles a \"row of tombstones\" The target antigens for PV are most commonly Desmoglein 3 and sometimes Desmoglein 1. The image below shows the common target antigen in Intraepidermal Immunobullous Disorders.

      "question": "A patient presented with sinusitis, ulcerative lesions on the nasopharynx, nodular lesions with cavitations of the lung, and renal failure. Which of the following is the most useful investigation in this patient?",
      "options": {
        "A": "Test for ANCA",
        "B": "Biopsy to show granuloma",
        "C": "AFB staining of sputum",
        "D": "BAL"
      },
      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: A) Test for ANCA Explanation: The clinical scenario of sinusitis, ulcerative lesions on the nasopharynx (upper respiratory tract), nodular lesions with cavitation in the lungs (lower respiratory tract), and renal failure strongly suggests granulomatosis with polyangiitis . The most useful investigation in this case is a test for ANCA. Granulomatosis with Polyangiitis (GPA): GPA is a vasculitic disorder characterized by granulomatous inflammation of the upper and lower respiratory tracts , small vessel vasculitis, and pauci-immune glomerulonephritis. Pathology and Pathogenesis: Hallmarks: Necrotizing vasculitis and granuloma formation in affected organs. Organs involved: Lungs: Nodular cavitary infiltrates ; necrotizing granulomatous vasculitis. Kidneys: Pauci-immune glomerulonephritis with minimal immune complex deposition. Upper airway: Granulomatous inflammation , necrosis, nasal septal perforation, and saddle nose deformity. Immune imbalance: Predominantly Th1-mediated cytokine response with elevated IFN- γ , TNF- α , and IL-12. Clinical Features: Respiratory tract: Paranasal sinus pain , nasal discharge (purulent/bloody), subglottic stenosis, cough, hemoptysis, and dyspnea. Renal: Proteinuria, hematuria, red blood cell casts, and progressive renal failure. Skin: Palpable purpura, ulcers, or nodules with vasculitis. Ocular: Conjunctivitis, episcleritis, retro-orbital masses, and proptosis. Neurological: Mononeuritis multiplex, cranial neuritis, or cerebral vasculitis. Systemic symptoms: Malaise, fever, weight loss, arthralgia, and fatigue. Diagnosis: Biopsy: Lung biopsy: High diagnostic yield, showing granulomatous vasculitis. Renal biopsy: Pauci-immune glomerulonephritis. Serology: Antiproteinase-3 ANCA positivity (~90%). Treatment: Induction Therapy: Glucocorticoids, cyclophosphamide or rituximab Maintenance Therapy: Azathioprine, mycophenolate mofetil or methotrexate Biopsy to show granuloma (Option B) : While granulomas may be seen in granulomatosis with polyangiitis (GPA), their absence does not exclude the diagnosis. Biopsy findings are supportive but not definitive, and testing for ANCA is less invasive and provides earlier diagnostic information. AFB staining of sputum (Option C) is primarily used for diagnosing tuberculosis, which does not match the clinical presentation of combined upper and lower respiratory tract involvement with renal failure seen in GPA. BAL (Bronchoalveolar Lavage) (Option D) can help evaluate lung involvement and detect inflammatory cells but is not specific for GPA. ANCA testing is more specific and less invasive for confirming the diagnosis in this case. Reference: Harrison’s Principles of Internal Medicine, 21st Edition, Page 2806-2809",

      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: C) Steroids Explanation: The symptoms suggest the diagnosis of Giant Cell Arteritis (GCA), for which the first line of treatment is administering steroids . Giant Cell Arteritis (GCA): GCA is an inflammatory condition of medium and large-sized arteries Earlier called temporal arteritis due to temporal artery involvement It's a systemic vasculitis affecting carotid artery branches and the aorta and its major branches It occurs almost exclusively in people over 50 years Shows strong female predominance Genetic associations: HLA-DR4 and HLA-DRB1*04 variants Strong association with polymyalgia rheumatica (PMR): 40-50% of GCA patients have PMR 10-20% of PMR patients later develop GCA Clinical Manifestations: Common Symptoms: Fever Headaches Malaise and fatigue Anorexia and weight loss Sweats Arthralgias Scalp pain Jaw claudication Complications: Ischemic optic neuropathy leading to blindness Strokes Scalp/tongue infarction Large vessel complications (in up to 1/3rd of patients): Subclavian artery stenosis Aortic aneurysms (thoracic > abdominal) Risk of aortic rupture or dissection Treatment Protocol: Initial Management: Prednisone 40-60 mg/day for 1 month IV methylprednisolone 1000 mg daily for 3 days if ocular symptoms Aspirin (Option D) 81 mg daily to reduce cranial ischemic complications Additional Therapies: Tocilizumab (anti-IL-6) FDA approved (Option B) Given as 162 mg SC weekly/biweekly with steroids Methotrexate as alternative steroid-sparing agent Monitoring: Treatment typically needed for ≥ 2 years ESR/CRP is useful for monitoring 60-85% have symptom recurrence during tapering Watch for glucocorticoid toxicity (35-65% of patients) Abatacept (Option A) can be used to treat giant cell arteritis along with prednisolone to reduce the risk of relapse. However, it is not the first-line treatment. Aspirin (Option D) is not the first-line treatment for giant cell arteritis and is only prescribed for cases with high ischemic risks.

      "question": "A woman presents with numbness of her fingertips. On examination, her face is tightened. The antinuclear antibody(ANA) is found to be positive and immunofluorescence shows the nucleolar pattern. What is the likely diagnosis?",
      "options": {
        "A": "Systemic sclerosis",

        "C": "Systemic lupus erythematosus",
        "D": "Rheumatoid arthritis"
      },
      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: A) Systemic sclerosis Explanation: Numbness in fingertips and tightened face with ANA finding positive and nucleolar pattern in immunofluorescence suggest systemic sclerosis. Dermal Manifestations of Systemic Sclerosis (SSc): Bilateral Symmetrical Skin Thickening : Begins distally in the fingers and progresses proximally. Skin Pigmentation Changes : Early diffuse tanning without sun exposure. Hypopigmentation with a \"salt-and-pepper\" appearance on the scalp, upper back, and chest is common in dark-skinned individuals. Sclerosis of Skin and Loss of Appendages : Leads to hair loss, reduced sweating, xerosis, and itching. Disappearance of transverse finger creases and fixed flexion contractures causing muscle atrophy. Fixed Contractures : Affects wrists, elbows, and knees due to skin and tendon fibrosis. Neck Skin Ridges : Firm adherence to platysma muscle limits neck extension. Facial Changes (\"Mauskopf\") : Taut, shiny skin with loss of wrinkles and reduced mobility. Thinned lips, prominent perioral radial furrows, and microstomia. Pinched, beak-like nose. Telangiectasia : Dilated capillaries on face, hands, lips, and oral mucosa; correlated with microvascular disease severity. Skin Ulcerations : Chronic ulcers on fingertips, PIP joints, and bony prominences heal slowly and may become infected. Fingertip ischemia leaves fixed digital \"pits.\" Acro-Osteolysis: Resorption of terminal phalanges due to ischemia. Calcinosis Cutis : Dystrophic calcifications in the skin and soft tissues, commonly in patients with anti-centromere antibody–positive lcSSc. Calcific deposits vary in size and may ulcerate, causing pain, infections, or nerve compression. Immunofluorescence: The nucleolar pattern in immunofluorescence detecting Th/To autoantibodies. Incorrect Options: Sjögren's Syndrome (Option B) is an autoimmune disorder primarily affecting moisture-producing glands, leading to dry mouth and eyes, gritty eye sensation, fatigue, joint pain, etc. Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) (Option C) is a multisystem autoimmune disease that can affect many organs. Common manifestations include a malar (butterfly) rash, joint pain, kidney problems, and blood abnormalities. While SLE may cause numbness or tingling due to nerve involvement, its ANA pattern is typically homogeneous or speckled, not nucleolar. Rheumatoid arthritis (Option D) primarily affects the joints, causing inflammation, pain, and stiffness. It does not typically involve numbness of the fingertips or the tightening of the face seen in systemic sclerosis. Additionally, the nucleolar pattern on ANA immunofluorescence testing is not associated with rheumatoid arthritis.",

      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: C) Takayasu arteritis Explanation: The clinical scenario of forearm claudication, transient loss of vision, and abdominal pain with weak femoral pulses point to the diagnosis of Takayasu arteritis. Takayasu Arteritis (\"Pulseless disease\"): General features: Predominantly affects young females (<20 years) Vascular Involvement: A leading cause of renal artery stenosis in India Most commonly affects the left subclavian artery Characteristic ostial narrowing vs. diffuse involvement in atherosclerosis Clinical Features: a) Early Phase (Pre-pulseless): Systemic symptoms: fever, malaise, night sweats Arthralgias, anorexia, weight loss b) Vascular Phase: Arm claudication Unequal blood pressure between arms Pulseless disease (difficult to appreciate radial artery) Hypertension (32-93%) Differential Diagnosis: Young female with renal artery stenosis: India: Think Takayasu arteritis USA: Think fibromuscular dysplasia (FMD) Arm claudication: Rule out neurogenic claudication (cervical disc disease) Investigations: ESR/CRP elevation Mild anaemia Elevated immunoglobulins Investigation of choice: MR angiography (MRA) Complete imaging of the aorta and major branches is needed Management: First Line: Steroids (40-60mg prednisone/day) Second Line: Methotrexate ( up to 25mg/week) for steroid-refractory cases Important Points for Differential Blood Pressure: Normal difference between arm-leg BP: <20 mmHg Conditions with unequal arm BPs: Takayasu arteritis Supravalvular aortic stenosis with Coanda effect Preductal coarctation of aorta Major complications: Heart failure, stroke, MI, aneurysm rupture, renal failure. Incorrect Options: Polyarteritis nodosa (Option A) presents non-specific symptoms like weakness, malaise, headache, abdominal pain, and myalgia. These symptoms do not align with the given scenario. Thromboangitis obliterans (Option B) or Buerger disease affects the small to medium arteries and veins and presents with ischemic signs and symptoms in the regions of the distal arteries of the upper and lower limbs. In this condition, claudication is seen in the arch of the foot and calf and is also called the Raynauds phenomenon. Microscopic polyangiitis (Option D) is a rare autoimmune disease where there is small vessel necrotizing vasculitis that manifests as systemic symptoms involving the kidneys (rapidly progressive glomerulonephritis), lungs (diffuse alveolar haemorrhage, chronic interstitial fibrosis), skin (palpable purpura, urticaria, nodules, etc), GIT (bleeding), and CNS (peripheral neuropathy).

      },
      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: A) HLA-B27 Explanation: The combination of uveitis, enthesitis, and sacroiliitis is characteristic of ankylosing spondylitis (AS) and other spondyloarthropathies, which are strongly associated with HLA-B27. Ankylosing Spondylitis Clinical Features General Features Spine and Joint involvement Extra-articular manifestations Inflammatory back pain : Gradual onset, worse with inactivity, improves with movement and is often associated with early morning stiffness. Fatigue : A common and significant symptom. Postural changes : Loss of lumbar lordosis, increased thoracic kyphosis, and forward stooping of the neck. Enthesitis : Inflammation at tendon or ligament attachment sites, often mistaken for fibromyalgia. Peripheral joint involvement : Affects large joints like hips, knees , and shoulders and is usually asymmetrical. Sacroiliac joint involvement : B/L and asymmetrical; pain may radiate to the buttocks or posterior thighs. Reduced spinal mobility: Limited movement in the lumbar region due to inflammation and pain, often accompanied by muscle spasms. Anterior uveitis: Most common extra articular manifestation. Presents with sudden unilateral eye pain, redness, and light sensitivity, often preceding joint symptoms. Anaemia, prostatitis, inflammatory bowel disease, aortic valve disease, and very rare cases of amyloidosis or upper lobe pulmonary fibrosis Osteoporosis : This can lead to vertebral fractures, especially with spinal fusion. Investigations of Ankylosing Spondylitis Tests X-rays MRI HLA-B27: The presence of the HLA-B27 gene is a strong indicator of AS. The prevalence of AS in the general population is less than 0.5%. Inflammatory Markers : Elevated ESR and CRP levels may indicate active disease. Faecal Calprotectin : Helps screen for associated inflammatory bowel disease. Show characteristic changes in sacroiliac joints , such as: Blurred cortical margins Erosions and sclerosis \"Pseudowidening\" of joint space (early stages) Joint space narrowing and fusion (later stages) Bamboo spine - Vertebral body fusion by syndesmophytes Dagger sign - Calcification appears as a single radiodense line vertically running down the spine on frontal radiographs. Investigation of choice – more sensitive than X-rays for detecting early inflammatory changes. Can reveal bone marrow oedema, enthesitis, synovitis, and erosions.

      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: B) Diffuse cutaneous systemic sclerosis Explanation: Diffuse Scleroderma Skin thickening over large body areas (fingers, hands, arms, anterior trunk, legs, and face). Significant risk of organ damage (GI tract, kidneys, lungs, heart). Associated with skin dryness, itching, and musculoskeletal pain. Life-threatening when lungs or heart are severely involved. Acute, severe high blood pressure can lead to kidney damage. Dermal Manifestations of Systemic Sclerosis (SSc) Bilateral Symmetrical Skin Thickening : Begins distally in the fingers and progresses proximally. Skin Pigmentation Changes : Early diffuse tanning without sun exposure. Hypopigmentation with a \"salt-and-pepper\" appearance on the scalp, upper back, and chest is common in dark-skinned individuals. Sclerosis of Skin and Loss of Appendages : Leads to hair loss, reduced sweating, xerosis, and itching. Disappearance of transverse finger creases and fixed flexion contractures causing muscle atrophy. Fixed Contractures : Affects wrists, elbows, and knees due to skin and tendon fibrosis. Neck Skin Ridges : Firm adherence to platysma muscle limits neck extension. Facial Changes (\"Mauskopf\") : Taut, shiny skin with loss of wrinkles and reduced mobility. Thinned lips, prominent perioral radial furrows, and microstomia. Pinched, beak-like nose. Telangiectasia : Dilated capillaries on face, hands, lips, and oral mucosa; correlated with microvascular disease severity. Skin Ulcerations : Chronic ulcers on fingertips, PIP joints, and bony prominences heal slowly and may become infected. Fingertip ischemia leaves fixed digital \"pits.\" Acro-Osteolysis: Resorption of terminal phalanges due to ischemia. Calcinosis Cutis : Dystrophic calcifications in the skin and soft tissues, commonly in patients with anti-centromere antibody–positive lcSSc. Calcific deposits vary in size and may ulcerate, causing pain, infections, or nerve compression. Incorrect Options: Limited cutaneous systemic sclerosis (Option A) is positive for anti-centromere antibody or ACA. Raynaud’s phenomenon (Option C) is one of the characteristic presentations of diffuse cutaneous systemic sclerosis. Some body parts, like the fingers and nose, feel numb and cool in response to cold temperatures or stress. Peutz-jeghers syndrome (Option D) is an inherited condition that increases the risk of hamartomatous polyps in the GIT and cancers in the GIT and that of the breast, testicles, and ovaries. Since there are no polyps, PJS is unlikely to be the diagnosis.",

Sjogren syndrome Pathogenesis: Sjogren Syndrome is an autoimmune disorder primarily affecting the exocrine glands. The pathogenesis involves lymphocytic infiltration (mainly T and B cells) into exocrine glands, especially the salivary and lacrimal glands. A complex interaction of genetic predisposition, environmental factors, and abnormal immune response triggers this infiltration. B-cell hyperactivity: Characterized by hypergammaglobulinemia and autoantibody production (e.g., anti-Ro/SSA and anti-La/SSB). Epithelial cell role: Exocrine gland epithelial cells may express autoantigens (Ro, La), produce pro-inflammatory cytokines, and express Toll-like receptors, facilitating immune activation I . Genetic predisposition: Certain HLA alleles (e.g., HLA-DQA1*0501) and immune-regulatory genes (IRF5, STAT4) increase susceptibility. Clinical Features: The hallmark symptoms are xerostomia (dry mouth) and keratoconjunctivitis sicca (dry eyes). Other symptoms include: Oral symptoms: Dry mouth, difficulty swallowing, increased dental caries, and parotid gland enlargement. Ocular symptoms: Gritty sensation, burning, decreased tear production.

SLE is a chronic autoimmune disease characterized by the presence of a wide range of autoantibodies, including ANAs. ANA testing is a valuable tool in the diagnosis of SLE, as it helps to detect the presence of these antibodies in the patient's blood. The most common ANA pattern seen in SLE is a homogeneous (diffuse) pattern, although other patterns can also be observed. Incorrect Options : Option A . Scleroderma: ANAs are also present in scleroderma, another autoimmune disease, but their presence is not specific for scleroderma alone. Additional antibodies such as anti-centromere antibodies (ACA) and anti-topoisomerase I (Scl-70) antibodies are more specific for scleroderma diagnosis. Option C . Drug-induced lupus: Drug-induced lupus is a condition that can occur as a result of certain medications, and it shares some clinical features with SLE. However, ANAs are not typically required for the diagnosis of drug-induced lupus. The presence of ANAs in drug-induced lupus is less common and usually of lower titer compared to SLE. Option D . Sjogren's syndrome: ANAs are present in the majority of patients with Sjogren's syndrome, an autoimmune disorder characterized by dry eyes and mouth. However, the hallmark autoantibodies in Sjogren's syndrome are anti-SSA (Ro) and anti-SSB (La) antibodies. These antibodies are more specific for the diagnosis of Sjogren's syndrome than ANAs alone.

      },
      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: A) Allopurinol Explanation: Allopurinol is the first-line choice for gout management. It is a purine analog that acts as a xanthine oxidase inhibitor, effectively reducing uric acid production. The drug works through dual mechanisms : direct inhibition of xanthine oxidase and competition with phosphoribosylpyrophosphate in the salvage pathway. Allopurinol: Allopurinol is the first-line treatment for the prevention of gouty arthritis, particularly in patients who are overproducers of uric acid. The initial dose is typically 100 mg daily, with a target urate level of <5-6 mg/dL and can be titrated up to 800 mg as needed. In patients with renal impairment, dose adjustments are essential. Adverse effects : Stevens-Johnson syndrome Toxic epidermal necrolysis Acute gout flare-up, which may occur due to rapid urate level reduction To prevent flare-ups, anti-inflammatory therapy should be continued until the patient is normouricemic and has not had an attack for 3-6 months. Capecitabine (Option B) is a pyrimidine analog used in breast cancer treatment. This medication has no role in gout management and does not affect uric acid metabolism. Cytarabine (Option C) is a cytosine arabinoside and pyrimidine analog used in chemotherapy. It is not indicated for gout treatment and does not influence uric acid levels. Febuxostat (Option D) is also a xanthine oxidase inhibitor. While effective for gout, it is not a purine analog.

        "B": "Anti Jo1 antibody",
        "C": "Anti centromere antibody",
        "D": "Antinuclear antibody"
      },
      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer A - Anti PM /Scl antibody Raynaud’s phenomenon and scl-70 positivity signify systemic sclerosis (diffuse). The peri fascicular infiltration and raised creatine kinase signify the presence of dermatomyositis/ polymyositis. Hence, this is called overlap syndrome (dermatomyositis/ polymyositis + systemic sclerosis), and the antibody linked to this combined scenario is Anti PM/ Scl antibody. Overlap Syndrome occurs when dermatomyositis (DM) or polymyositis (PM) coexists with other connective tissue diseases (CTDs), such as scleroderma, mixed connective tissue disease (MCTD), Sjögren’s syndrome, systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), or rheumatoid arthritis. Polymyositis Clinical Features: Polymyositis (PM) presents with symmetric, proximal muscle weakness that worsens over weeks to months. PM can involve the heart, lungs, and joints and is associated with an increased risk of cancer, although likely less than dermatomyositis (DM). Laboratory Features: Creatine kinase (CK) levels always elevate in uncontrolled PM; normal CK suggests the inclusion of body myositis. Electromyography (EMG) and muscle imaging can show abnormalities but are not specific to PM.

Dental caries are common due to the lack of saliva's protective effects. Enlarged cervical lymph nodes can occur due to immune system activity. This syndrome often presents with these classic symptoms. Incorrect Options: Option A - MCTD (Mixed Connective Tissue Disease): MCTD is an autoimmune disorder that shares features of multiple other connective tissue diseases, such as systemic lupus erythematosus, scleroderma, and polymyositis. While dry mouth and dry eyes can occur in autoimmune disorders, the specific symptoms described (grittiness in eyes, dental caries, and enlarged cervical lymph nodes) are more characteristic of Sjogren syndrome. Option B - Sarcoidosis: Sarcoidosis is a disease characterized by the growth of tiny collections of inflammatory cells (granulomas) in different parts of the body. While it can affect various organs, including the lungs, skin, and eyes, the primary symptoms described (dry mouth, dry eyes, dental caries, and enlarged cervical lymph nodes) are not typically associated with sarcoidosis. Sarcoidosis would more likely involve lung issues and skin lesions. Option D - Wegener's Granulomatosis (Granulomatosis with Polyangiitis): Wegener's granulomatosis is a type of vasculitis that primarily affects the respiratory tract and kidneys. It usually presents with symptoms related to those organs, such as sinusitis, lung problems, and kidney dysfunction.

      "explanation": "osteopetrosis there is a defect in the normal process of bone resorption, resulting in excessive accumulation of dense, brittle bone tissue. This leads to increased bone density and reduced bone marrow space. The term \"marble bone\" refers to the appearance of the bones on imaging studies, which appear dense and resemble marble. Osteopetrosis can be inherited as an autosomal recessive or autosomal dominant condition and can manifest with various symptoms such as fractures, anemia, and impaired vision or hearing.

      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "and peripheral neuropathy is suggestive of small vessel vasculitis . ANCA testing is a valuable investigation in such case. ANCA is a group of autoantibodies that target neutrophil cytoplasmic antigens. Two main patterns of ANCA are recognized: cytoplasmic (c-ANCA) and perinuclear (p-ANCA). c-ANCA i s typically associated with antibodies against proteinase 3 (PR3) and is seen in granulomatosis with polyangiitis (formerly known as Wegener's granulomatosis). p-ANCA is associated with antibodies against myeloperoxidase (MPO) and is seen in microscopic polyangiitis and eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis (formerly known as Churg-Strauss syndrome). Incorrect Options: Option B - RA factor (rheumatoid factor): Rheumatoid factor is an autoantibody commonly associated with rheumatoid arthritis (RA). While RA can involve multiple systems, including joints, it is not typically associated with cutaneous vasculitis, glomerulonephritis, and peripheral neuropathy. Therefore, performing RA factor testing is unlikely to provide relevant diagnostic information in this case. Option C - HbsAg (hepatitis B surface antigen): Hepatitis B infection can present with various clinical manifestations, but cutaneous vasculitis, glomerulonephritis, and peripheral neuropathy are not commonly associated with hepatitis B infection. Therefore, testing for HbsAg is unlikely to help diagnose the underlying condition in this case. Option D - MIF (migration inhibitory factor): Migration inhibitory factor is a pro-inflammatory cytokine that has been implicated in various inflammatory conditions. However, it is not specific to any particular disease or diagnostic entity. Testing for MIF alone would not provide sufficient diagnostic information to identify the underlying cause of the patient's presentation with cutaneous vasculitis, glomerulonephritis, and peripheral neuropathy.

These antibodies target an enzyme called topoisomerase I, which is involved in DNA replication and repair. The presence of anti-topoisomerase antibodies is strongly associated with skin involvement and internal organ complications in systemic sclerosis. Incorrect Options: Option A - Anti-DNA: Anti-DNA antibodies are typically associated with autoimmune diseases such as systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) rather than systemic sclerosis. While anti-DNA antibodies may be present in some cases of systemic sclerosis, they are not considered specific to the disease. Option C - ANA: ANA (antinuclear antibodies) is a general term for antibodies that target components within the cell nucleus. While ANA can be detected in various autoimmune diseases, including systemic sclerosis, it is not specific to the condition. ANA testing is often used as a screening tool to indicate the presence of an autoimmune process, but it does not provide a definitive diagnosis on its own. Option D - Anti-Ro: Anti-Ro (SS-A) antibodies are associated with various autoimmune conditions, including systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and Sjögren's syndrome.
