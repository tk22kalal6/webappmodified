Transcatheter Aortic Valve Replacement (TAVR)-Associated IE: Causative Organisms : Enterococcus spp. is the primary organism. (Option B) Incidence : IE following TAVR procedures is not uncommon, with the risk related to the procedure itself and the implantation of a prosthetic valve, which can serve as a nidus for infection. 2. Cardiac Implantable Electronic Devices (CIEDs)-Associated IE: Causative Organisms : Gram-positive bacteria, particularly Staphylococcus epidermidis (coagulase-negative staphylococci) are the most common pathogens responsible. Staphylococci (especially Staphylococcus aureus ) are also responsible. Methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) has been reported in varying degrees of frequency. Incidence : The incidence of IE is higher in devices like Implantable Cardioverter Defibrillators (ICDs) and Cardiac Resynchronization Therapy (CRT) compared to pacemakers due to the larger device size and more invasive nature of the procedure. 3. Pacemaker-Associated IE: Causative Organisms : Similar to other CIEDs, Staphylococcus epidermidis is the primary causative organism in pacemaker-related IE.

Vascular Phenomenon Includes splenic and cerebral abscesses. Immunological Phenomena Clarifies immune complex-mediated glomerulonephritis, with a practical definition involving unexplained acute kidney injury, hematuria, proteinuria, or a renal biopsy showing immune complex disease. Microbiological Evidence PCR, amplicon or metagenomic sequencing of typical pathogens from sterile sites other than cardiac tissue is now a minor criterion. (Option C) Imaging Abnormal metabolic activity detected by [18F]FDG PET/CT within three months of prosthetic valve or device implantation is included. Physical Exam A new regurgitant murmur on auscultation is considered a minor criterion when echocardiography is unavailable. Negative blood cultures (Option A): While negative blood cultures can occur in IE, especially in cases involving fastidious organisms or prior antibiotic use, this is not a minor criterion. Blood culture positivity, when present, is a major criterion, not a minor one. Echocardiogram revealing mitral regurgitation (Option B): While the presence of a regurgitant murmur may suggest valvular dysfunction, it is a major criterion in Modified Duke’s criteria and is not a minor criteria update in the 2023 ISCVID classification. Fever and night sweats (Option D): Fever is a minor criterion for diagnosing IE according to the Modified Duke criteria, as it suggests systemic infection. It is not a newly added criterion. Night sweats may also be symptomatic of IE, but it does not independently qualify as minor diagnostic criteria.

Simplified Blood Culture Protocol : Timing and separate venipuncture rules have been removed, though separate draws are still ideal. Fastidious Pathogens : New criteria account for hard-to-culture organisms like Coxiella burnetii, Bartonella, and Tropheryma whipplei, diagnosed via PCR or specific serology. Imaging Criteria Cardiac CT (CCT): Findings like valvular vegetation, perforation, aneurysm, intracardiac fistula or abscesses on CCT are now considered major criteria. (Option A) [18F]FDG PET/CT : Abnormal metabolic activity on [18F]FDG PET/CT, especially around prosthetic valves or intracardiac devices, is recognised as a major diagnostic criterion. Surgical Evidence Intraoperative Findings : Direct visual evidence of IE during surgery, such as vegetations or abscesses, qualifies as a major criterion in cases without other definitive findings.

      "explanation": "Correct answer: B) Evidence of endocardial involvement by FDG-PET/CT Explanation: The FDG-PET/CT scan revealed abnormal uptake around the prosthetic valve, which is considered a major criterion under the Modified Duke’s Criteria. FDG-PET/CT is useful in cases involving prosthetic valves where traditional blood cultures might be negative, helping to detect inflammation around the valve, consistent with endocardial involvement. Modified Duke’s Criteria - Major criteria Positive blood cultures Identification of a typical organism from two cultures, or persistent positive cultures drawn more than 12 hours apart. Three or more positive cultures that have been taken over at least one hour apart. A single positive blood culture for Coxiella burnetii or a phase I IgG antibody titre > 1:800. Evidence of endocardial involvement Positive echocardiographic findings such as vegetations, abscesses, or new valvular regurgitation. Oscillating intracardiac masses or partial dehiscence of a prosthetic valve. Additional diagnostic tools like FDG-PET/CT or EKG-gated cardiac CT angiograms also meet major criteria for prosthetic valve endocarditis. (Added by the European Society of Cardiology) Negative blood culture for a typical organism (Option A): Negative blood cultures do not satisfy the major criterion in the Modified Duke’s Criteria. The criterion requires positive cultures for typical organisms like Staphylococcus aureus or Streptococcus viridans, but in this case, cultures are negative. Abscess formation (Option C): While abscess formation can be a major criterion in infective endocarditis, imaging is needed to confirm this. There was no mention of an abscess either on the echocardiogram or the FDG-PET/CT in this case. Recent history of dental procedures (Option D): Although dental procedures can predispose patients to infective endocarditis, it is not a major criterion in the Modified Duke’s Criteria.

The peripheral manifestations of her condition are reflected in the presence of Roth spots, which are pale-centred retinal haemorrhages seen during a fundoscopic examination, and splinter haemorrhages , which are linear red to brown streaks under her fingernails. Cardiac Manifestations Heart murmurs : Present in 80-85% of cases, usually indicating predisposing cardiac pathology; new or worsened regurgitant murmurs occur in 20-50% of patients. Congestive heart failure (CHF) : Occurs in 30-40% due to valve dysfunction or intracardiac fistulae. Paravalvular abscesses : Develop when leaflet infection extends into adjacent tissue, causing intracardiac fistulae and new murmurs. Heart block : Aortic paravalvular infections can burrow into the upper ventricular septum, leading to heart block. Coronary artery emboli : Occur in 2% of patients, potentially causing myocardial infarction.

Neurologic complications : Strokes complicate 15-35% of cases; also include encephalopathy, seizures, meningitis, intracranial haemorrhage, mycotic aneurysms, and brain abscesses. Renal complications : Hypocomplementemic glomerulonephritis due to immune complex deposition, often improving with antimicrobial therapy; renal infarcts may cause flank pain and hematuria.

      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "(NBTE) or injured endothelium. Correct Answer: B) They facilitate bacterial adherence to nonbacterial thrombotic endocarditis (NBTE) or injured endothelium. Explanation: MSCRAMMs (microbial surface components recognizing adhesin matrix molecules) are key adhesion factors that enable bacteria to attach to NBTE or damaged endothelium, crucial for the establishment of infective endocarditis. Pathophysiology Endothelial injury : Damage from high-velocity blood jets or cardiac lesions (e.g., mitral regurgitation, aortic stenosis) leads to platelet-fibrin thrombus formation, creating a nonbacterial thrombotic endocarditis (NBTE). Thrombus as a bacterial site : The thrombus becomes a site for bacterial attachment during transient bacteremia. Hypercoagulable states : Conditions like malignancy (marantic endocarditis), systemic lupus erythematosus, and antiphospholipid syndrome cause bland vegetation. Bacterial entry : Pathogens enter the bloodstream from colonized surfaces or infection sites. Staphylococcus aureus can adhere to intact endothelial cells through von Willebrand factor, which is induced by local inflammation . This facilitates platelet and bacterial adherence. Adhesion to NBTE: MSCRAMMs are molecules, present on pathogens, that allow bacteria to adhere to damaged endothelium or sites of NBTE . Common components include: Fibronectin-binding proteins (in gram-positive bacteria ) Clumping factor (on S. aureus ) etc. S. aureus can invade intact endothelium using fibronectin-binding proteins , allowing infection to develop even in previously healthy heart valves. Once bacteria adhere, they form microcolonies that resist serum bactericidal activity and the microbicidal peptides released by platelets. Vegetation formation : Fibrin, platelets, and microorganisms combine into infected vegetations. Clinical symptoms : Arise from intracardiac damage, embolization, remote tissue infection or infarction, and immune-mediated injury. Complications of Embolization in Infective Endocarditis : Tissue Infarction : Embolized vegetation fragments can obstruct blood flow, causing infarctions in organs like the brain, kidneys, spleen, and extremities. Left-sided infective endocarditis typically affects the brain and spleen, while right-sided IE often leads to pulmonary embolism. Hematogenous Infection : Vegetation fragments can spread bacteria to distant organs, causing secondary infections like brain abscesses or lung infections. Immune-Mediated Damage : Circulating immune complexes may deposit in tissues, resulting in immune-related injury. They enhance the immune response against pathogens during bacteremia (Option A) : MSCRAMMs do not enhance the immune response; instead, they help bacteria adhere to surfaces, which can evade immune detection. They are responsible for the formation of emboli that lead to tissue infarction (Option C : While bacterial fragments can lead to emboli, MSCRAMMs are not responsible for their formation; they primarily assist in bacterial adherence. They promote the breakdown of vegetation formed in the heart (Option D) : MSCRAMMs do not promote the breakdown of vegetation; they play a role in bacterial adherence and colonization rather than in vegetation degradation.",

      "explanation": "Correct answer: C) Mycobacterium chimaera Explanation: Mycobacterium chimaera has been linked to global outbreaks of prosthetic valve endocarditis (PVE) due to contamination from heater-cooler machines used during cardiopulmonary bypass. Culture-Negative Infective Endocarditis (IE): Common Cause : One-third to one-half of culture-negative cases are due to prior antibiotic exposure. Fastidious Organisms : Streptococci , Granulicatella , and Abiotrophia species. HACEK organisms-Haemophilus, Aggregatibacter, Cardiobacterium, Eikenella, and Kingella Coxiella burnetii , and Bartonella species. Special Cases : Tropheryma whipplei. : Associated with Whipple's disease (GI symptoms, arthritis, carditis) Causes an indolent, afebrile, culture-negative form of IE. C. burnetii : Frequently infects prosthetic valves. Corynebacterium species and Propionibacterium acnes : Linked to intracardiac devices, slow-growing in cultures. Mycobacterium chimaera : Difficult to grow, associated with global PVE outbreaks due to heater-cooler machine contamination. Mimics of IE : Atrial myxoma, marantic endocarditis, and antiphospholipid antibody syndrome may present similarly to culture-negative IE. SHOTGUN Metagenomics Shotgun metagenomic sequencing captures all genes from every organism in a complex sample. It enables the evaluation of microbial diversity and the detection of microbial abundance across different environments. This method allows the study of microorganisms that cannot be cultured using traditional techniques. Utilizes next-generation sequencing (NGS) for detailed and comprehensive microbial analysis. Staphylococcus aureus (Option B): A common cause of early prosthetic valve infections but not linked to heater-cooler contamination. Streptococcus viridans (Option C): Typically causes subacute native valve endocarditis and late PVE, not associated with contaminated devices. Coxiella burnetii (Option D): Causes chronic Q fever endocarditis, often linked to animal exposure, not heater-cooler devices.

      },
      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Correct answer: C) Infective endarteritis Explanation: The patient’s history of PDA, intravenous drug use, and new onset systolic murmur which indicates altered blood flow, possibly due to the PDA or from vegetation affecting the blood flow through the aorta or associated vessels strongly suggests infective endarteritis. Infective endarteritis Infective endarteritis is an infection of the inner layer of arteries, often affecting shunts (arteriovenous, arterio-arterial like PDA) or coarctation of the aorta. It was once the leading cause of death in patients with patent ductus arteriosus (PDA), Now rare due to the routine use of antibiotics and surgical PDA closure, especially in asymptomatic patients or those with silent PDAs. Associated with PDA, the most frequent complications are left heart failure and infective endarteritis. Pathogenesis : Caused by turbulence in blood flow between the aorta and pulmonary artery and subsequent endothelial injury, leading to bacterial seeding and vegetation formation. Incidence : Predisposing factors include intravenous drug use, sepsis, congenital heart disease, and the presence of indwelling catheters. Diagnosis : Common bacteria : Staphylococcus and Streptococcus viridans TEE (Transesophageal echocardiography) is more sensitive than TTE (Transthoracic echocardiography) for visualising vegetation in adults. Treatment : IV bactericidal antibiotics for 2-6 weeks. Surgery is necessary for patients with PDA and infective endarteritis due to the risk of severe complications (e.g., heart failure, septic emboli, arrhythmias, strokes or mycotic aneurysms). Acute bacterial endocarditis (Option A) typically presents with rapid-onset symptoms and is more commonly associated with high-virulence organisms. The gradual onset of this patient's symptoms, history of PDA, and vegetation along the aorta point more towards infective endarteritis. Subacute bacterial endocarditis (Option B): The patient's history of PDA and the specific mention of vegetation along the aorta point more towards infective endarteritis rather than typical subacute endocarditis. Myocardial infarction (Option D): This is unlikely as the symptoms and findings are consistent with an infectious process rather than ischemic heart disease.

Explanation: The patient's symptoms have persisted for over a month, aligning with the gradual onset characteristic of subacute bacterial endocarditis. Additionally, her history of mitral valve prolapse suggests a predisposing condition for the development of endocarditis. Streptococcus viridans is the most common organism associated with subacute bacterial endocarditis, particularly in individuals with underlying heart conditions. Acute Bacterial Endocarditis Subacute Bacterial Endocarditis (SBE) Aggressive course compared to subacute endocarditis. Causative organisms : S. aureus (Most common cause) (including MRSA), S. pneumoniae, L. monocytogenes, Haemophilus species, streptococci (groups A, B, G). Risk factors : Comorbid conditions like malignancy, diabetes mellitus, IV drug use, or alcoholism. Presentation : Fever, fatigue, and malaise within <2 weeks of infection. Changing heart murmur, potential congestive heart failure. Possible signs: Janeway lesions (hemorrhagic macules on palms/soles), petechiae, Roth’s spots, splinter haemorrhages, splenomegaly (rare). Slow progression compared to Acute endocarditis Causative organism: Streptococcus viridans (Most common cause) Presentation : Gradual onset over weeks to months (>2 weeks) but can be life-threatening if untreated. Symptoms: unexplained fever, chills, night sweats, fatigue, weight loss, joint/muscle aches, chest/back pain, and skin rashes. Risk Factors : Periodontal disease, IV drug use, prolonged IV medication. Congenital heart defects, prior endocarditis, valve surgery, or pacemaker implants. More common in men, especially over age 60. Treatment : High-dose IV antibiotics for 2-6 weeks. Surgery may be needed for abscess drainage or valve repair/replacement. Staphylococcus aureus (Option A) is more commonly associated with acute bacterial endocarditis. Enterococcus faecalis (Option C) and HACEK organisms (Option D) are less frequent causes of subacute cases than Streptococcus viridans. Reference: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK470547/",

      "explanation": "than left-sided infective endocarditis. Correct answer: A) Right-sided infective endocarditis is more commonly associated with enterococci than left-sided infective endocarditis. Explanation: Enterococci are more common in left-sided infective endocarditis than in right-sided IE. Intravenous Drug Use (IDU) and Infective Endocarditis (IE) IDU is strongly associated with infective endocarditis (IE) due to non-sterile injection techniques, allowing skin bacteria and other particles to enter the bloodstream, causing endothelial damage and infection, especially at heart valves. More commonly affects right side of the heart. Right-Sided IDU-Associated IE Left-Sided IDU-Associated IE Valve Involvement : Predominantly affects the tricuspid valve. Causative Pathogen : Staphylococcus aureus (Especially MRSA) is responsible for 85% of cases , primarily due to poor injection hygiene. (Option B ruled out) Pathophysiology : Injected particles damage right-sided valves. Bacteremia from skin bacteria (like S. aureus ) easily colonizes these valves. Surgical Intervention : Surgery is rare and tricuspid valve insufficiency is generally well tolerated. Prognosis : Right-sided IE has a better long-term prognosis. (Option D ruled out) Valve Involvement : Affects the aortic or mitral valves, occurring in about 20-30% of IDU-related IE cases. Causative Pathogen : S. aureus causes 46% of cases, but alpha-hemolytic streptococci and enterococci are more common than in right-sided IE. (Option A) Pathophysiology : Left-sided IE often occurs in individuals with underlying valve disease or degenerative changes, which are more common in older patients. Injected particles are less likely to reach the left-sided valves because they often get trapped in the lungs. (Option C ruled out) Surgical Intervention : Surgery is much more common due to the more severe nature of left-sided lesions (e.g., abscess formation, severe heart failure).

      "explanation": "ventricular dysfunction often triggered by emotional or physical stress . The patient’s recent stressful event, post-menopausal status, ballooning of the left ventricle, and minimal elevation of cardiac enzymes align perfectly with this diagnosis. Takotsubo cardiomyopathy (Gebrochenes-Herz syndrome) About Takotsubo cardiomyopathy, also known as broken-heart syndrome or stress-induced cardiomyopathy, is a non-ischemic condition primarily affecting post-menopausal women. It features temporary left ventricular dysfunction that resembles a heart attack but with minimal cardiac enzyme release and no significant obstructive coronary artery disease. The name \"Takotsubo\" is derived from Japanese, meaning octopus trap, reflecting the ballooning shape of the left ventricle during contraction. Pathophysiology Catecholamine Hypothesis: Elevated catecholamines (norepinephrine, epinephrine, dopamine) indicate stress-induced sympathetic overdrive, leading to microvascular spasms and myocardial injury. Microvascular Dysfunction: Impaired function is suggested by abnormalities in coronary flow reserve and microvascular resistance. Inflammation: Imaging may show myocardial oedema, necrosis, and fibrosis, with conditions like myocarditis and autoimmune diseases potentially triggering TC. Estrogen Deficiency: Exaggerated vasoconstriction and increased sympathetic activity in post-menopausal women contribute to TC. Clinical features Takotsubo cardiomyopathy often mimics acute coronary syndrome.(MI) Common Triggers: Emotional Stress: Events like the unexpected death of a loved one, domestic abuse, or financial loss. Physical Stress: Serious medical diagnoses or natural disasters. Symptoms: Chest pain, dyspnea, and syncope. Some patients may have signs of heart failure, such as tachyarrhythmias or bradyarrhythmias. A late-peaking systolic murmur may be present due to LVOTO (Left Ventricular Outflow Tract Obstruction). About 10% of patients may develop cardiogenic shock. Hypertensive Heart Disease (Option A): Caused by chronic high blood pressure, leading to left ventricular hypertrophy. This patient's history does not indicate long-standing hypertension. Coronary Artery Disease (Option C): Involves plaque buildup in coronary arteries, causing reduced blood flow. The absence of obstructive disease on angiography and minimal enzyme release suggests this is unlikely. Pulmonary Embolism (Option D): Occurs when a blood clot blocks a pulmonary artery, leading to sudden shortness of breath and chest pain. History of long term immobilization/ DVT is present. The patient's findings indicate a cardiac issue, not a pulmonary one.

Raised ESR and CRP are common inflammatory markers. Throat Swab Culture Used to identify group A β -haemolytic streptococci . Cultures may also be taken from family members and contacts to confirm the source of infection. Antistreptolysin O (ASO) titres Elevated ASO levels (> 200 U in adults, > 300 U in children) or rising titres support the diagnosis of acute rheumatic fever.

      "explanation": "Correct answer: C) It is associated with emotional lability Explanation: Sydenham's chorea is characterized by involuntary, purposeless movements, and significant emotional instability , often presenting as mood swings and obsessive-compulsive traits. It is more common in females. These features highlight its distinctive neurological profile as a complication of rheumatic fever. Other prominent manifestations of ARF: 1. Arthritis Prevalence and Onset : Occurs in approximately 75% of ARF patients. Presents acutely and also as migratory arthritis. Joint Involvement : Affects large joints asymmetrically, commonly the knees, ankles, elbows, and wrists. Each joint can be affected for 1 day to 4 weeks. Treatment : Rapidly improves with salicylates (aspirin) and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). 2. Skin Manifestations : Erythema Marginatum : Red macules with a red border, typically on the trunk and proximal limbs. Less than 5% prevalence Subcutaneous Nodules : Firm, painless nodules located over bony prominences, appearing more than 3 weeks after other symptoms. Less than 5% prevalence. It is an early manifestation of rheumatic fever (Option A): Sydenham's chorea typically arises as a delayed complication of acute rheumatic fever, emerging at least three months after the initial episode, rather than being an early symptom. It occurs in all patients with rheumatic fever (Option B): This condition does not affect every individual with rheumatic fever, rather, it affects approximately one-third of the cases. It has no connection to previous infections (Option D): Sydenham's chorea is directly related to previous streptococcal infections, as it is a complication that arises following acute rheumatic fever, which itself is triggered by such infections.

      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "leaflets (valvulitis) in acute rheumatic fever (ARF). The inflammation causes nodular thickening of the valve. Murmur occurs due to increase blood flow across thickened leaflets of mitral valve. This is specifically associated with ARF and reflects early mitral valve involvement, which is common in rheumatic carditis. It differs from other murmurs because it is related to inflammation, not structural narrowing or regurgitation. Mitral stenosis murmur (Option A): Mitral stenosis typically results from long-term damage to the mitral valve, leading to the narrowing of the valve orifice. This condition is usually seen in chronic rheumatic heart disease (RHD), not during the acute phase of rheumatic fever. On auscultation, Pan-diastolic murmur will be heard at apex. Aortic regurgitation murmur (Option B): Aortic regurgitation can occur in rheumatic fever, especially when the aortic valve is involved. However, it produces a distinct high-pitched early diastolic murmur that is heard best at the left sternal border. Pericardial friction rub (Option D): A pericardial friction rub occurs with pericarditis, which creates a leathery or scratchy sound distinct from murmurs caused by valvular inflammation. While pericarditis can occur in ARF, the friction rub is not related to the soft mid-diastolic murmur.

      },
      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "Correct answer: A) Polyarthritis Explanation: Polyarthritis is the most common symptom in ARF , seen in 60-75% of cases. In India, polyarthritis remains a prominent early manifestation of ARF. India has a high incidence of rheumatic heart disease, ranging from 13 to 150 cases per 100,000 population annually. (D 515) The course of Acute Rheumatic Fever Latent Period Common Early Features Late Features After upper respiratory tract infection/ pharyngitis with GABHS, ARF symptoms typically develop after a latent period of 3 weeks (range: 1–5 weeks). A sore throat can occur. Chorea and indolent carditis can manifest up to 6 months later following a prolonged latent period. Polyarthritis : Seen in 60-75% of ARF cases, often affecting large joints (knees, ankles, elbows). Migratory inflammation is a key feature. Carditis : Occurs in 50-75% of cases, frequently leading to mitral valve damage (regurgitation initially). Aortic valve involvement is also common.. Valvular damage can progress from regurgitation to stenosis over time, leading to heart failure in the long term. Recurrent ARF episodes increase the risk of chronic heart valve disease (rheumatic heart disease). Chorea: Varies by population, from less than 2% to 30%. Predominantly affects females and often coexists with carditis. Skin Manifestations : Erythema marginatum (rare, less than 5% of cases) and subcutaneous nodules (also less than 5%). (Options B and C ruled out) Pulmonary Hypertension (Option D): It is not a direct manifestation of ARF but can occur as a late complication due to left-sided valvular disease, particularly mitral valve involvement leading to pulmonary pressure increase. This complication is seen after years of progressive heart valve damage and is not a frequent presenting feature.",

      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "and heart tissue Correct answer: B) Immune response triggered by molecular mimicry between bacterial antigens and heart tissue Explanation: The clinical features point to Acute Rheumatic Fever(ARF). ARF results from antibodies reacting to group A Streptococcus antigens, which mimic heart tissue. Pathogenesis of Acute Rheumatic Fever: Immune Response: ARF is an autoimmune condition triggered by group A I hemolytic Streptococcus (GABHS) infection, leading the immune system to attack the body’s tissues. Molecular Mimicry : The immune system mistakes body tissues for GAS antigens, particularly due to similarities between the Streptococcus M protein and N-acetylglucosamine with human proteins. Heart Valve Damage: Cross-reactive antibodies bind to heart valve endothelial cells, activating VCAM-11, which attracts lymphocytes. This process leads to heart valve damage and rheumatic heart disease (RHD). T-cell Involvement: Damaged heart tissue releases peptides that activate cross-reactive T-cells, further amplifying tissue damage through epitope spreading. Susceptibility Factors: Genetic predispositions (e.g., HLA alleles) and specific Streptococcus strains influence the risk of developing ARF. HLA-DR7 and HLA-DR4 are associated with susceptibility to ARF. Direct invasion of heart valves by Streptococcus bacteria (Option A): ARF is not caused by direct bacterial invasion but by an autoimmune response. Autoimmune destruction of heart valves due to viral infection (Option C): RF is associated with bacterial, not viral, infections. Genetic mutations in heart muscle proteins (Option D): ARF involves immune responses, not genetic mutations affecting heart proteins.

      "explanation": "Correct answer: D) Continue prophylaxis until the age of 21 Explanation: Secondary Prevention in Acute Rheumatic Fever Preferred Antibiotic Benzathine penicillin G is recommended as the first choice. Dosage is: 1.2 million units for individuals >27 kg. 600,000 units for individuals ≤ 27 kg. Typically administered every 4 weeks, may increase to every 2–3 weeks for adherence issues. Alternative Antibiotics Oral Erythromycin (250 mg twice daily) is recommended for patients allergic to penicillin. Oral penicillin V (250 mg twice daily) can be used but is less effective. Duration of Prophylaxis Determined by the presence and severity of carditis, age, and time since the last ARF episode No Carditis (Option B) 5 years or until 21 years of age, whichever is longer. Carditis without Valvular Disease 10 years or until 21 years of age, whichever is longer. Persistent Valvular Disease 10 years or until 40 years of age, whichever is longer. Lifelong prophylaxis may be needed in severe cases. Continue prophylaxis for 1 more year (Option A): The recommended duration is based on the time since the last attack and the patient’s age, not a fixed additional year. Continue prophylaxis until the age of 25 (Option B): AHA guidelines specify prophylaxis until the age of 21 or for five years, whichever is longer, in the absence of carditis. Discontinue prophylaxis immediately (Option C): Discontinuation before the age of 21 is not advised in the absence of carditis.

      "explanation": "Correct Answer: D) Perform immediate coronary angiography and start aspirin. Explanation: The patient's symptoms, ST-segment elevation on ECG, and mild troponin elevation suggest Takotsubo cardiomyopathy, especially given her postmenopausal status and recent stress. The initial management focuses on ruling out obstructive coronary disease through coronary angiography while addressing acute symptoms. Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy Investigations ECG Changes: Similar to pericarditis stages, with ST-segment elevation, T-wave inversions, and eventual normalization. Cardiac Biomarkers: Mild elevation of troponins (median initial troponin: 7.7 times normal) and elevated BNP or N-terminal pro-BNP levels. Echocardiography: Systolic apical ballooning of LV with mid-apical depression. Cardiovascular Magnetic Resonance (CMR): Helps diagnose stress cardiomyopathy, showing myocardial oedema, necrosis, and fibrosis. Treatment Risk Factors for Adverse Outcomes: Physical triggers, neurologic/psychiatric conditions, high initial troponin, low ejection fraction, male gender. Initial Treatment: Aspirin, beta-blockers, ACE inhibitors, lipid-lowering agents, and coronary angiography. Stable Patients: Cardioselective beta-blockers and ACE inhibitors for 3-6 months. Serial imaging to monitor wall motion and ejection fraction. Anticoagulation: Reserved for patients with ventricular thrombus (5% occurrence). (Option A ruled out) Unstable Patients: Inotropes for cardiogenic shock without left ventricular outflow obstruction. (Option C ruled out) Mechanical support (intra-aortic balloon pump or left ventricular assist devices) may be needed.
