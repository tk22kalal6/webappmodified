      "options": {
        "A": "Lysosomal acid alpha-glucosidase",
        "B": "Glucose 6 phosphatase",
        "C": "Muscle phosphorylase",
        "D": "Phosphofructokinase"
      },
      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer A - Lysosomal acid alpha-glucosidase Pompe’s disease is a muscle glycogen storage disorder, also known as Glycogen storage disorder type I,I which is caused by the deficiency of acid α -1,4-glucosidase . Pompe disease (Glycogen Storage Disease Type II) Definition Glycogen storage disorder caused by deficiency of acid α -1,4-glucosidase (acid maltase) Inheritance Autosomal recessive Pathophysiology Accumulation of glycogen in lysosomes, primarily affecting cardiac, skeletal, and smooth muscle cells Forms Infantile Pompe disease (IPD) - Severe Late-onset Pompe disease (LOPD) - Less Severe Clinical Features IPD: Hypotonia, muscle weakness, feeding difficulties, hepatomegaly, hypertrophic cardiomyopathy LOPD: Proximal limb-girdle muscle weakness, respiratory muscle involvement, cardiac rhythm disturbances Laboratory Findings Elevated serum CK, AST, ALT, LDH Cardiomegaly on chest X-ray (infantile form) ECG changes- shortened P-R interval, tall QRS complexes Treatment Enzyme replacement therapy with alglucosidase alfa High-protein diet (for LOPD) Histopathology findings: muscle biopsy/ cardiac biopsy has vacuoles within muscle fibres which stain with PAS strongly (glycogen is pas positive, diastase sensitive) Glucose 6 phosphatase (Option B) is an enzyme involved in gluconeogenesis and glycogenolysis. Deficiency of this enzyme is seen in Von Gierke's disease (glycogen storage disease type I), not in Pompe's disease. Muscle phosphorylase (Option C) , also known as myophosphorylase, is an enzyme involved in glycogenolysis (the breakdown of glycogen into glucose) in muscle tissue. A deficiency of muscle phosphorylase leads to McArdle disease (glycogen storage disease type V), characterized by exercise intolerance and muscle cramps. Phosphofructokinase (Option D) is an enzyme involved in glycolysis, the breakdown of glucose to produce energy. Deficiency of phosphofructokinase leads to Tarui disease (glycogen storage disease type VII), characterized by exercise intolerance and muscle weakness.

        "C": "Echocardiography",
        "D": "Fasting blood glucose"
      },
      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer A - ANA The ANA test is not typically performed as part of Turner mosaic screening. ANA testing is primarily used to help diagnose autoimmune conditions such as systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) or other connective tissue diseases. Condition Evaluation Cardiac Abnormalities EKG (for prolonged QT interval), Blood pressure (upper and lower extremities), Echocardiogram (Option C) or Cardiac MRI for anomalies. Cognitive Function/Learning Disabilities Special education assessments and evaluations at school. Hearing Loss Serial audiology evaluations (Option B) every 3 years in children, and every 5 years in adults. Renal Abnormalities Renal ultrasound at diagnosis. Ovarian Failure Serum FSH and AMH at 10-11 years. Osteoporosis/Bone Health Screening for low bone mineral density and fractures. Annual screening for scoliosis during growth hormone therapy. Celiac Disease Tissue transglutaminase immunoglobulin A antibodies at 2 years, and every 2 years thereafter. Autoimmune Thyroiditis TSH and free or total T4 measurements annually starting at 4 years. Liver Disease ALT, AST, GGT, and alkaline phosphatase annually after 10 years. Metabolic Syndrome Hemoglobin A1c annually, starting at 10 years. Lipid panel annually if cardiovascular risk factors are present. Vitamin D Deficiency Serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D at 9-11 years, and every 2-3 years thereafter. Gonadoblastoma Screening for Y chromosome if marker chromosome elements are present or virilization develops. Screening Laboratory Tests Fasting blood glucose (Option D) , glycated haemoglobin, serum creatinine, and urinalysis at 10 years and above to screen for diabetes mellitus and kidney disease.

      "question": "Which is the best confirmatory method to ensure the central line is in the jugular vein?",
      "options": {
        "A": "Chest X-ray",
        "B": "Blood pH",
        "C": "Blood color",
        "D": "ETCO2"
      },
      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: A) Chest X-ray Explanation: Importance of Chest X-ray in Central Line Placement Initial Assessment: A chest X-ray should be performed immediately after internal jugular and subclavian line placement to confirm correct catheter placement and rule out iatrogenic pneumothorax. Post-Procedure Verification: It is crucial to verify catheter placement and ensure no complications, like pneumothorax, following the procedure. Ipsilateral Side Approach: If the internal jugular central venous line (CVL) insertion fails, move to the ipsilateral subclavian vein. A chest X-ray or ultrasound should be performed before attempting the opposite side to prevent bilateral pneumothoraces. Options B, C, and D are incorrect.

        "C": "Thymic cyst",
        "D": "Carotid body tumour"
      },
      "correct_answer": "D",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: D) Carotid body tumour Explanation: In the above scenario, there is a pulsatile swelling, and on MRI angiography, it shows Lyre's sign which is the splaying of internal and external arteries , which is diagnostic of carotid body tumour. Carotid Body Tumor (CBT) CBT, also known as paraganglioma or chemodectoma , is a rare benign neck tumour originating from the neural crest at the adventitia of the common carotid artery bifurcation. CBTs grow slowly, have a low cancer rate, and are not significantly associated with age or gender, though some suggest a slightly higher incidence in women. The pathogenesis is unclear but is linked to chronic hypoxia and mutations in mitochondrial oxygen-sensitive genes. Diagnosis: B-mode Ultrasonography: It shows solid, hypoechoic tumours near blood vessels. Digital Subtraction Angiography (DSA): DSA visualized tumour blood supply and the displacement of arteries, with a diagnostic coincidence rate of 100%. Magnetic",

        "D": "NSAID’s"
      },
      "correct_answer": "D",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: D) NSAID’s Explanation: Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) can be used to relieve pain and reduce inflammation associated with blisters. The recommended approach includes protecting the blister, keeping it clean, and using pain-relieving measures such as NSAIDs, if necessary. Avoid Sun Exposure : Keep the affected area out of the sun to prevent further damage. Skin Care : Apply cool compresses, aloe vera gel, or lotion to soothe the skin. Avoid local anaesthetic creams. Blister Care : Wash ruptured blisters with soap and water and cover with moist gauze. Options A and B are incorrect. Pentoxyphylline (Option C) is a medication that can improve blood flow and is sometimes used in the treatment of vascular disorders. This is not indicated here.

      "correct_answer": "D",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: D) Clubbing Explanation: The image shows typical findings of clubbing of fingers, seen in various cardiopulmonary conditions. Clubbing is not always irreversible and can be reversible in certain conditions. Clubbing of fingers Definition Enlargement of distal segments of fingers and toes Proliferation of connective tissue Particularly on the dorsal surface Changes at the base of clubbed nail Pathophysiology Connective tissue proliferation Exact mechanism unknown Platelet-derived growth factors implicated Clinical Signs Bulbous Enlargement of the Distal Phalanges Loss of the Normal Angle Between the Nail and the Nailbed (Lovibond’s Angle) Increased Sponginess of the Soft Tissue at the Base of the Nail Nail Changes: Nail flattening / nail curvature Hippocratic fingers : The tips of the fingers become enlarged, and the nails curve downward Clinical tests Schamroth’s Sign: Normal : A small diamond-shaped window should be visible between the nails when the fingers are positioned in this way. Positive Schamroth’s Sign : The window disappears, and there is no gap between the nails, indicating the loss of the normal angle at the nail bed. Associated Conditions Cyanotic congenital heart disease Infective endocarditis Bronchiectasis Cystic Fibrosis Lung cancer Tuberculosis Inflammatory bowel disease Key Features Can be hereditary or acquired May be reversible in certain circumstances Associated with hypertrophic osteoarthropathy Can cause pain and arthritis-like changes Spoon-shaped nails (koilonychia) (Option A): The nail abnormality is characterized by thin, fragile nails with a concave appearance, either horizontally or vertically oriented. The nail plate appears to be depressed in the centre and bent outward at the edges. Raynaud's phenomenon (Option B) presents as repeated constriction of blood vessels in the fingers and toes, typically triggered by cold temperatures or stress. Pallor (Option C) refers to a noticeable decrease in the normal colour and tone of the skin or mucous membranes, which may occur due to",

        "C": "Scorpion",
        "D": "Shellfish"
      },
      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: C) Scorpion Explanation: The clinical features and the characteristics of the animal with a curved tail pointing upwards point to the possibility of the animal being a scorpion . Less dangerous scorpions: Local pain, swelling, and burning sensation Symptoms resolve in a few hours Possible allergic reactions to venom Bark scorpions (e.g., Centruroides species): Intense pain, paresthesia, and hyperesthesia (worsened by tapping) Restlessness, blurred vision, abnormal eye movements Excessive salivation, sweating , and difficulty handling secretions Nausea, vomiting, slurred speech Muscle twitching , jerking, and shaking (may resemble seizures) Tachycardia, arrhythmias, hypertension, hyperthermia, rhabdomyolysis Respiratory arrest, especially in children and the elderly Venomous scorpions (e.g., Tityus serrulatus, Leiurus quinquestriatus): Hypertensive crises, arrhythmias, myocardial damage Pulmonary oedema, central nervous toxicity Other species (e.g., Hemiscorpius lepturus): Pain, hemolysis, tissue necrosis (delayed onset) Systemic complications: hemoglobinuria, acute kidney injury General symptoms of envenomations: Immediate sharp local pain Edema, ecchymosis, and burning sensation Symptoms generally resolve within hours for most species Treatment of scorpion sting: Identification of the scorpion species is essential for determining treatment, as stings from non-lethal species typically only require basic care. Non-lethal stings : Most stings cause local discomfort and can be managed at home with ice packs, analgesics, or antihistamines. Patients should return to the emergency department if cranial-nerve or neuromuscular symptoms develop. Severe envenomations : Aggressive supportive care and careful use of antivenom can prevent deaths from more dangerous stings. Initial measures : Keeping the patient calm, applying pressure dressings, and using cold packs can reduce venom absorption. Treatment for symptoms : Continuous IV infusion of midazolam can control agitation and muscle movements, but close monitoring is needed due to the risk of respiratory arrest, especially when sedatives or narcotics are used. Management of complications : Hypertension and pulmonary oedema : Managed with nifedipine, nitroprusside, hydralazine, or prazosin . Bradycardia : Managed with atropine. Antivenin : FDA-approved antivenin (C. sculpturatus IgG F(ab')2 in horse serum) is available in some countries and can rapidly reverse cranial-nerve dysfunction and muscular symptoms when administered intravenously. Options A, B, and D are incorrect. Reference: Harrison’s Principles of Internal Medicine, 21st Edition, Page: 3613.",
