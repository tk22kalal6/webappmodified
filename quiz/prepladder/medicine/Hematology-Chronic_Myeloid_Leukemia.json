      "explanation": "Correct answer: D) Balanced translocation between the long arms of chromosomes 9 and 22 and 22 [t(9;22)(q34.1;q11.2)] (Option B) . It is present in the majority of patients with chronic myeloid leukaemia (CML). Formation of Philadelphia chromosome: A balanced translocation is a type of chromosomal rearrangement in which segments of two different chromosomes break and exchange places without any loss of genetic material. (Option D) In the case of CML, a segment of chromosome 9 containing the ABL gene ( Abelson Leukemia) , located at the q34 region, moves to chromosome 22. Similarly, the segment of chromosome 22 containing the BCR gene (breakpoint cluster region) , located at the q11 region, moves to chromosome 9. This exchange results in the formation of two derivative chromosomes: one with the truncated chromosome 9 segment and the BCR-ABL fusion gene and the other with the truncated chromosome 22 segment. The chromosome containing the BCR-ABL fusion gene is known as the Philadelphia chromosome. The BCR-ABL fusion forms a novel oncoprotein called p210 bcr-abl-1 (210 = molecular weight in kiloDalton—210 kDa). Translocation between chromosomes 12 and 21 [t(12;21)] (Option A) is seen in B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukaemia. Deletion of chromosomes 11q, 13q, and 17p (Option C) are seen in small lymphocytic leukemia/Chronic lymphocytic leukemia.",

      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "gene, leading to genomic instability. Correct answer: B) CML patients who progress to blast crisis often acquire mutations in the TP53 gene, leading to genomic instability. Explanation: Chronic-phase CML can progress to blast crisis, characterized by the rapid proliferation of immature blast cells resembling acute leukaemia. This transformation is often associated with acquired mutations in the TP53 gene, which plays a critical role in regulating cell cycle checkpoints and DNA repair. TP53 mutations can lead to genomic instability, allowing for the uncontrolled growth of leukemic cells, as seen in the blast crisis. Key genetic abnormalities in CML: Genetic Abnormality Description Philadelphia Chromosome (Ph) A reciprocal translocation between chromosomes 9 and 22 [t(9;22)] , resulting in the fusion of the BCR gene on chromosome 22 with the ABL gene on chromosome 9 (Option A ruled out). BCR-ABL Fusion Gene The fusion of BCR and ABL genes leads to a constitutively active tyrosine kinase (BCR-ABL) that promotes uncontrolled cell proliferation and survival in CML. ABL Kinase Domain Mutations Mutations within the ABL kinase domain, particularly T315I, are associated with resistance to tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) used in CML treatment. (Option D ruled out). JAK-STAT Signaling Pathway Although not directly activated by BCR-ABL, JAK-STAT pathway dysregulation may contribute to CML pathogenesis, including disease progression and resistance. (Option C ruled out). TP53 Mutations Acquired mutations in TP53 , common in blast crisis CML, lead to genomic instability, cell cycle dysregulation, and aggressive disease behaviour.

      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Correct answer: C) Continue the current dose of imatinib and monitor qPCR every 3 months is to achieve and maintain a deep molecular response, is assessed by quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) for BCR-ABL transcript levels on the International Scale (IS). A complete cytogenetic response refers to the absence of Ph-positive metaphases (0% Ph positivity). This is approximately equivalent to BCR-ABL1 transcripts (IS) of 1% or less. A qPCR level of 0.1% or less on the IS is considered a major molecular response (MMR). While a level o f 0.01% or less is considered a deep molecular response (DMR). In this scenario, the patient has achieved a qPCR level of 0.02% on the IS, indicating a good response to imatinib therapy. It is important to continue the current dose of imatinib and monitor qPCR levels every 3 months to assess for any changes in response. (Option C) Response to Imatinib in CML: Hematological Response: Full blood count done every 2 weeks Patients should be asymptomatic. Platelet count should be <450,000/µL.

      },
      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Correct answer: C) Blockade of aberrant tyrosine kinase signaling Explanation: Imatinib exerts its therapeutic effect by binding to the ATP-binding site of the BCR-ABL tyrosine kinase domain , thereby inhibiting its enzymatic activity. (Option C) This blockade of BCR-ABL tyrosine kinase activity prevents downstream signaling cascades involved in cell proliferation, survival, and differentiation, ultimately leading to apoptosis of leukemic cells and suppression of disease progression in CML. This fusion protein results from the Philadelphia chromosome (Ph+) , which is formed by a reciprocal translocation between chromosomes 9 and 22 [t(9;22)(q34;q11)]. Mode of action of imatinib on BCR-ABL. ADP, adenosine diphosphate; ATP, adenosine triphosphate; P, phosphate. Inhibition of BCL-2, leading to apoptosis of leukemic cells (Option A) : Imatinib does not directly inhibit BCL-2, an anti-apoptotic protein, but rather targets the BCR-ABL fusion protein. Activation of tyrosine kinase activity, promoting leukemic cell proliferation (Option B) : Imatinib does not activate tyrosine kinase; rather, it inhibits it. The BCR-ABL fusion protein, a tyrosine kinase, promotes proliferation, and imatinib counteracts this effect. Stimulation of DNA repair mechanisms, enhancing leukemic cell survival (Option D) : Imatinib does not stimulate DNA repair mechanisms but rather inhibits tyrosine kinase signaling pathways.",

      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Correct answer: B) Intravenous hydration, rasburicase, and diuretics Explanation: The patient's clinical presentation with laboratory findings of hyperkalemia, hyperphosphatemia, hypocalcemia, hyperuricemia, and elevated creatinine is consistent with tumour lysis syndrome (TLS) In chronic myeloid leukaemia (CML), initiation of chemotherapy can lead to a massive release of nucleic acids, potassium, phosphorus, uric acid, and other cellular contents from lysed leukemic cells. The initial management of TLS includes aggressive intravenous hydration to maintain renal perfusion and promote urinary excretion of uric acid and other metabolic byproducts. Rasburicase, a recombinant urate oxidase enzyme , is indicated to rapidly lower serum uric acid levels. It converts uric acid into a more soluble metabolite, allantoin, which is easily excreted by the kidneys. Diuretics may also be administered to enhance urinary excretion of electrolytes and prevent renal damage. Prophylaxis for TLS is Allopurinol- it reduces the risk of uric acid nephropathy but is of no benefit once tumor lysis has occurred Rasburicase is contraindicated in patients with glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency who are unable to break down hydrogen peroxide, an end product of the urate oxidase reaction. Lysis Syndrome\" data-author=\"\" data-hash=\"10362\" data-license=\"\" data-source=\"\" data-tags=\"April2025\" height=\"1000\" src=\"https://image.prepladder.com/notes/LhuUEYxLjBRmd3bRZpr71744701330.png\" width=\"667\" /> Management of patients at high risk for tumor lysis syndrome Intravenous hydration and diuretics (Option A): While hydration and diuretics are essential, this option does not address the high uric acid levels or the need for more specific management of tumor lysis syndrome. Intravenous hydration and calcium gluconate (Option C): Calcium gluconate is indicated for treating symptomatic hypocalcemia, which can occur due to TLS, but it does not address the underlying metabolic abnormalities. Intravenous hydration, loop diuretics, and sodium bicarbonate (Option D): Urinary alkalinization with sodium bicarbonate is no longer recommended. It increases uric acid solubility, but a high pH decreases the solubility of xanthine, hypoxanthine, and calcium phosphate, potentially increasing the likelihood of intratubular crystallization. Loop diuretics may exacerbate electrolyte imbalances and should be used cautiously.

      },
      "correct_answer": "D",
      "explanation": "Correct answer:D) Initiate treatment with ponatinib Explanation: The T315I mutation within the ABL kinase domain is a known mechanism of resistance to first-generation tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) like imatinib. Ponatinib is a third-generation TKI that has demonstrated efficacy against the T315I mutation. It is a suitable treatment option for patients with CML who develop resistance to this specific mutation. Unlike first-generation TKIs such as imatinib, which bind to the ATP-binding site of the BCR-ABL fusion protein, ponatinib is a multi-targeted TKI that also binds to an inactive conformation of BCR-ABL, allowing it to circumvent resistance mechanisms like the T315I mutation. Medical therapeutic options in CML: AGENT APPROVED INDICATIONS NOTABLE TOXICITIES Imatinib (Gleevec) All phases Fluid retention, weight gain, nausea, diarrhea, skin rashes, periorbital edema, bone or muscle aches and fatigue Dasatinib (2nd generation) All phases Myelosuppression, pleural and pericardial effusions , pulmonary hypertension Nilotinib (2nd generation) All phases except blastic phase Diabetes , arterio-occlusive disease , pancreatitis Bosutinib (2nd generation) All phases Most effective in case of imatinib-resistant CML Diarrhea , liver toxicity , renal dysfunction Ponatinib (3rd generation) Optimal TKI if T315I mutation Failure of ≥ 2 TKI’s Skin rashes, pancreatitis, arterio-occlusive disease, systemic hypertension Omacetaxine mepesuccinate (3rd generation) Failure of ≥ 2 TKI’s Myelosuppression Continue imatinib therapy at a higher dose (Option A): While dose escalation of imatinib may be considered in certain cases of CML with resistance mechanisms other than T315I mutation, it is not typically recommended as the next step in managing T315I-mediated resistance. Switch to a second-generation tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) such as dasatinib or nilotinib (Option B): Second-generation TKIs like dasatinib and nilotinib are commonly used as frontline treatments for CML. They are effective against most BCR-ABL mutations, but they have limited activity against the T315I mutation. Switching to a second-generation TKI may be considered if the patient has developed resistance to imatinib due to other mutations or mechanisms. However, it may not be effective in cases of the T315I mutation, which specifically confers resistance to these agents. Consider allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT) (Option C): Allo-HSCT is a potentially curative treatment for CML. However, allo-HSCT is associated with significant risks, including graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) and transplant-related mortality, and is generally reserved for patients with high-risk disease or those who have exhausted other treatment options, including third-generation TKIs.

      "explanation": "Correct answer: B) Sokal risk score Explanation: The Sokal risk score is used to stratify patients with chronic myeloid leukaemia (CML) into risk categories based on prognostic factors at the time of diagnosis. The components include (can be remembered as SPAM ): S pleen size. P latelet count. A ge. M yeloblast % in the peripheral smear. It can be calculated via an online tool by incorporating the values accordingly. Based on the calculated Sokal score, patients are categorized into risk groups: Risk Sokal score Low <0.8 Intermediate 0.8-1.2 High >1.2 High-risk patients have a poor prognosis and should be treated aggressively. Early consideration for allogeneic stem cell transplantation can be done. The other scoring systems used for the assessment of prognosis in CML are: Hasford score European Treatment and Outcome Study (EUTOS) Score Modification of Sokal score takes into addition two more values: Eosinophil count. Basophil count. Two parameters: Spleen size. Basophil count. Karnofsky's performance status (Option A) : This tool measures a patient's overall functional status and ability to perform daily activities, but it does not specifically evaluate prognosis in chronic myeloid leukemia (CML).
