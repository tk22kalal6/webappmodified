        "A": "Prop1",
        "B": "LHX3",
        "C": "T-PIT",
        "D": "PIT1"
      },
      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Correct answer: C) T-PIT Explanation: Mutations in the T-PIT gene are specifically associated with the development of corticotropes in the anterior pituitary, leading to ACTH deficiency and resulting in low cortisol levels. Congenital Hypopituitarism refers to the inadequate production of one or more anterior pituitary hormones, mainly GH, due to developmental defects in the pituitary gland. Causes of Congenital Hypopituitarism Developmental causes Pituitary dysplasia (Most Common) Abnormal development of the pituitary gland, which can be aplastic (absent), hypoplastic (underdeveloped), or ectopic (misplaced). Transcription factor defects: Pit-1 (Option D ruled out) : Determines cell-specific expression of growth hormone (GH), prolactin (PRL), and thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) in somatotrophs , lactotrophs , and thyrotrophs respectively. Prop-1 (Option A ruled out) : Induces development of somatotropes , lactotrope , thyrotrope and gonadotropes . T-Pit : Development of Corticotrope cells. Cause ACTH deficiency and hypocortisolism HESX1: Septo-optic dysplasia with combined pituitary hormone deficiency LHX3 (Option B ruled out) : Combined pituitary hormone deficiency with cervical spine rigidity. PAX6 & SOX2. Clinical Features GH deficiency Poor growth and short stature in children (Height below the 3rd percentile for age.) Midline Craniofacial Disorders: Abnormalities in midline structures (like the eyes and corpus callosum) can be associated with pituitary dysplasia due to the developmental pathways shared",

      "question": "A 3-year-old boy is brought to the pediatric clinic due to concerns about his growth and appearance. His height is below the 3rd percentile for his age, and the clinician suspects congenital hypopituitarism. Which syndromes are least likely to be associated with his condition?",
      "options": {
        "A": "Kallmann Syndrome",
        "B": "Bardet-Biedl Syndrome",
        "C": "Prader-Willi Syndrome",
        "D": "Laron Syndrome"
      },
      "correct_answer": "D",
      "explanation": "Correct answer: D) Laron Syndrome Explanation: Laron Syndrome is least likely to be associated with congenital hypopituitarism because it involves growth hormone receptor insensitivity, not a deficiency in hormone production. Although it leads to short stature, it is characterized by normal or elevated growth hormone levels, with the defect lying in the receptor rather than in hormone production. Congenital Hypopituitarism refers to the inadequate production of one or more anterior pituitary hormones, mainly Growth hormone, and is due to developmental defects in the pituitary gland. Syndromes associated with Congenital hypopituitarism: Kallmann Syndrome (Option A ruled out) Characterized by the absence of gonadotropin-releasing hormone ( GnRH ) and often associated with anosmia (loss of smell). Prader-Willi Syndrome (Option C ruled out) Involves hypogonadotropic hypogonadism , obesity , and developmental delays due to microdeletions on chromosome 15. Bardet-Biedl Syndrome (Option B ruled out) A rare genetic disorder involving obesity , intellectual disability , and renal abnormalities, along with potential GnRH deficiency. Leptin and Leptin Receptor Mutations Result in obesity and central hypogonadism due to impaired GnRH production Septo-optic dysplasia Congenital disorder involving underdevelopment of the optic nerves and midline brain structures . It is often associated with hypopituitarism, hypogonadism and HESX1 mutations. Reference: Harrison’s Principles of Internal Medicine, 21st Edition, Page 2892,2896",

      "question": "A 38-year-old female presents with fatigue, abdominal obesity , dry skin, decreased libido, and irregular menstrual cycles. Laboratory tests reveal low cortisol (3 µg/dL) and low ACTH levels. To confirm ACTH deficiency and to assess growth hormone reserve, which investigation is most appropriate?",
      "options": {
        "A": "Insulin Tolerance Test",

        "C": "Low-dose dexamethasone suppression test",
        "D": "Saline Infusion Test"
      },
      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "for confirming ACTH deficiency , as it evaluates both cortisol response and growth hormone secretion. Investigation of patients with Pituitary disease ACTH Deficiency Short ACTH Stimulation Test : Initial test for ACTH function. Insulin Tolerance Test : The gold standard for diagnosing ACTH deficiency, as it effectively assesses both cortisol and growth hormone responses . It can lead to severe hypoglycemia and should be performed under close medical supervision. In situations where hypoglycemia poses a risk, the rapid ACTH stimulation test is often preferred. It is contraindicated in Ischemic heart disease & Epilepsy . LH/FSH Deficiency Men : Measure random serum testosterone, LH, and FSH. Pre-menopausal Women : Assess menstrual regularity. Post-menopausal Women : Measure random serum LH and FSH (expected FSH > 30 IU/L, LH > 20 IU/L). TSH Deficiency : Serum T4 levels; TSH often detectable in secondary hypothyroidism Growth hormone deficiency Investigate only if considering GH replacement therapy. Stimulation tests for GH: Insulin-Induced Hypoglycemia Arginine (may combine with GHRH) Glucagon Clonidine (in children) Among anterior pituitary hormones GH & ACTH requires provocative tests others are assessed by pituitary function tests Short ACTH Stimulation Test (Option B) evaluates adrenal gland function by administering synthetic ACTH (usually cosyntropin) after measuring the baseline cortisol level. Blood samples are taken at 30 and 60 minutes to measure cortisol levels. A normal response shows a significant increase in cortisol, indicating healthy adrenal function, while a low or absent response may suggest adrenal insufficiency. Low-Dose Dexamethasone Suppression Test (Option C) evaluates the body's response to dexamethasone. The patient takes 1 mg of dexamethasone at bedtime, and a blood sample is collected the next morning to measure cortisol levels. In a healthy individual, dexamethasone suppresses cortisol production, leading to low levels. Lack of suppression may indicate Cushing's syndrome or hypercortisolism. The saline infusion test (Option D) helps diagnose primary hyperaldosteronism by assessing the body's response to an intravenous saline load, particularly aldosterone secretion. In patients with hyperaldosteronism, aldosterone levels remain high despite saline infusion.

      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Sheehan Syndrome: It refers to acute infarction and ischemic necrosis of the pituitary gland due to postpartum hemorrhage and subsequent hypovolemic hypotension. It is one of the most common causes of hypopituitarism Sheehan Syndrome Pathology Decrease in anterior pituitary hormones due to ischemic damage of anterior pituitary Initial Symptoms Classic early sign is failed lactation following delivery Varied Symptoms Based on the severity of pituitary damage Severe Hypopituitarism : Early symptoms :lethargy, anorexia, and weight loss soon after delivery. Delayed Symptoms : Secondary amenorrhea, loss of sexual hair, and fatigue may develop weeks to months later. Growth Hormone (GH) deficiency : Often the first hormone to be lost, leading to Hypoglycemia , muscle weakness , and mood swings . Signs of Premature aging: Wrinkling of face ACTH Deficiency: Can cause postural hypotension & worsen hypoglycemia . Thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) Deficiency : Results in secondary hypothyroidism . Unlike primary hypothyroidism, frank myxoedema is rare. Approximately I rd may present with hyponatremia , while Central diabetes insipidus is rarely observed. Pituitary adenoma (Option A) is a pituitary gland tumor that causes various hormonal imbalances. However, symptoms typically develop gradually and would not usually present acutely following childbirth or a significant hemorrhage. Preeclampsia (Option C) occurs during pregnancy and is characterized by high blood pressure and protein in the urine. It usually resolves after delivery and does not cause hormonal deficiencies leading to fatigue, weight loss, and inability to breastfeed weeks after childbirth. Simmonds Disease (Option D) is non-obstetric atrophy or destruction of the anterior lobe of the pituitary gland due to conditions like hypertension and sickle cell disease resulting in hypopituitarism, and symptoms appear gradually.

Serum findings Growth hormone, Prolactin, ACTH, TSH, LH and FSH ↓ . ADH is normal as the posterior pituitary is typically not affected. Management Hormone Replacement Therapies: Cortisol Replacement: Administer hydrocortisone (Initial treatment) if there is ACTH deficiency. Mineralocorticoid is not typically recommended. (Option C) Thyroid Hormone Replacement: Indication : Levothyroxine (50–150 µ g) should be given once daily. Aim to maintain serum T4 in the upper range of normal. Thyroid hormone (Option A) should not be administered without glucocorticoid therapy in cases of adrenal insufficiency, as this can lead to an adrenal crisis. Sex Hormone Replacement: Recommended for women under 50 years with gonadotropin deficiency and for men to restore sexual function and prevent osteoporosis. Growth Hormone Replacement: Growth hormone (GH) is given via daily subcutaneous injections for children and adolescents with GH deficiency (Option D) Side Effects : The primary side effect is sodium retention, which may present as peripheral oedema or carpal tunnel syndrome GH replacement should start at a low dose, with regular monitoring of serum IGF-1 to assess response.

      "explanation": "most likely developed pituitary apoplexy. High-dose IV glucocorticoids are the first-line treatment that addresses adrenal insufficiency, stabilizes blood pressure, and corrects hypoglycemia. Pituitary apoplexy Pathology Acute intra-pituitary hemorrhage resulting in an endocrine emergency It may arise spontaneously in preexisting adenomas, occur postpartum or be associated with conditions like diabetes, hypertension, sickle cell anemia, or acute shock. Severe ↓ ACTH and GH, other hormones maybe ↓ or normal Clinical features Severe headache Central nervous system (CNS) hemorrhage Signs of meningeal irritation Loss of consciousness Bilateral visual changes Ophthalmoplegia (eye muscle paralysis) Hypoglycemia Hypotension Shock Cardiovascular collapse Management High-dose glucocorticoids is the first line of treatment to correct adrenal insufficiency, stabilize blood pressure, and correct hypoglycemia. Patients without evident visual loss or impaired consciousness can be managed conservatively with high-dose glucocorticoids. Urgent surgical decompression: Required for patients with significant or progressive visual loss, cranial nerve palsy, or loss of consciousness. Monitoring: Visual recovery is inversely correlated with the duration of time after the acute event, so timely intervention is crucial. Urgent surgical decompression (Option A) is not indicated in this patient as he does not have any signs of visual defects, cranial nerve palsy or impaired consciousness. Thus, he can be treated conservatively with medical therapy. IV dextrose administration (Option C) can temporarily address hypoglycemia but it does not address the underlying adrenal insufficiency which is a medical emergency. Glucocorticoids are needed to stabilize adrenal function, after which glucose levels will normalize. Oral hydrocortisone (Option D) is not preferred as this is an acute endocrine emergency, and oral corticosteroids are not fast acting thus only IV forms of corticosteroid are preferred.
