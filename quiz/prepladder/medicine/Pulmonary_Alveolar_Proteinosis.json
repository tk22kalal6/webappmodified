      },
      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: C) Tuberculosis Explanation: The given clinical presentation is suggestive of Silicosis , a form of pneumoconiosis caused by the inhalation of silica dust, and is associated with an increased risk of developing tuberculosis (TB). Silicosis Leading cause of Interstitial lung disease (ILD) in India , frequently resulting from occupational exposure in the glassware, mining, quarrying, and construction industries. Manifests after 10-20 years of continuous exposure. Radiological features: The chest radiograph may show profuse miliary infiltration or consolidation, and there is a characteristic HRCT pattern known as “crazy paving” . Multiple well-circumscribed 3–5 mm nodular opacities predominantly in the mid- and upper zones. Enlargement of the hilar glands with an “egg-shell” pattern of calcification (seen in 20% of cases). As the disease progresses, progressive massive fibrosis (PMF) may develop. Individuals with silicosis are at increased risk of TB (silicotuberculosis), lung cancer and COPD; associations with renal and connective tissue disease have also been found. Pulmonary embolism (Option A): It is usually associated with immobility, surgery, or hypercoagulable states , not occupational lung diseases. While anyone can develop PE, silicosis does not specifically increase the risk for PE. Pneumothorax (Option B): It is more commonly associated with diseases like emphysema, tuberculosis, or cystic lung diseases , especially when there’s alveolar rupture . Silicosis doesn't commonly cause pneumothorax, so this is not a typical complication . Pleural effusion (Option D): While it can occur with various lung diseases, they are not a classic feature or complication of silicosis . Unless there's an underlying infection or malignancy, effusions are uncommon in this context.

      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: C) Bilateral pleural plaques Explanation: Workers in the shipbuilding and construction trades, including pipe fitters and boilermakers, are occupationally exposed to asbestos. Asbestosis is a diffuse interstitial fibrosing disease of the lung . Past exposure to asbestos is specifically indicated by pleural plaques on chest radiographs, which are characterized by either thickening or calcification along the parietal pleura, particularly along the lower lung fields. Pulmonary function testing in asbestosis reveals a restrictive pattern with a decrease in both lung volumes and diffusing capacity. Complications include carcinoma of lung and mesothelioma .

      },
      "correct_answer": "D",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: D) Langerhans cell histiocytosis Explanation: Langerhans cell histiocytosis is a rare disorder caused by Langerhans cell proliferation, leading to lung involvement, especially in smokers. It commonly affects young males with cystic and nodular abnormalities in the upper lobes. Lesions extend to broncho-vascular structures, forming characteristic stellate lesions, and there is an increased risk of spontaneous pneumothorax. Other Conditions Causing Smoking Related ILD Type HRCT findings Respiratory bronchiolitis with ILD (RB-ILD) Central and peripheral bronchial wall thickening, centrilobular nodules, and ground-glass opacities. Desquamative interstitial pneumonia ( DIP) Bilateral symmetric ground-glass opacities are often more pronounced with other similar findings of RB-ILD. This can also occur in children with a family history of fibrosis. Lymphangioleiomyomatosis (Option A) is a rare lung disease primarily affecting women of childbearing age , characterised by cystic changes on HRCT; however, it is not usually associated with smoking. Spontaneous pneumothorax can also develop in this condition. Lymphocytic interstitial pneumonitis (Option B) is often linked to autoimmune disorders or infections, particularly in immunocompromised individuals, rather than smoking. It is a diagnosis of exclusion in AIDS patients with shortness of breath. Pulmonary Alveolar Proteinosis (Option C) involves surfactant accumulation in the alveoli , impairing clearance and causing airway obstruction . Chest X-rays often show a \"bat wing\" appearance. It can be associated with autoimmune diseases, secondary conditions, or toxin exposure but is not primarily linked to smoking.",

        "D": "Churg Strauss Syndrome"
      },
      "correct_answer": "D",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: D) Churg Strauss Syndrome Explanation: Churg Strauss Syndrome , called Eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis (EG), is a small-medium vessel vasculitis. It often presents with respiratory symptoms like chronic sinusitis, asthma, peripheral eosinophilia, and positive perinuclear ANCA antibodies. Imaging reveals peripheral consolidative opacities (can be migratory) and small pleural effusions in the lungs. It is an example of granulomatous vasculitis causing ILD ; another example is Wegener Granulomatosis (Granulomatosis with polyangiitis). Wegener Granulomatosis (Option A) It commonly affects the ear, nose, throat, and kidneys, presenting with upper respiratory symptoms, pulmonary nodules, and renal dysfunction (glomerulonephritis). Imaging often shows nodules, ground-glass opacities, consolidations (sometimes migratory), and hilar lymphadenopathy. Hemoptysis is a common feature, as seen in both Wegener's granulomatosis (c-ANCA positive) and Churg-Strauss syndrome (p-ANCA positive), which also involves multiple organs. Sarcoidosis (Option B): It is a granulomatous lung disease without vasculitis. It is an inflammatory condition marked by granuloma formation, primarily affecting the lungs but sometimes involving the eyes or skin. It typically presents with bilateral hilar lymphadenopathy and pulmonary infiltrates, causing cough and dyspnea. Hypersensitivity pneumonia (Option C) It is caused by an immune reaction to inhaled triggers such as barn hay (Farmer's lung), sugar cane dust (Bagassosis), or cotton dust (Byssinosis). It involves an immune response to inhaled organic antigens, forming granulomas in the lung tissue (granulomatous lung disease). Symptoms resolve when the trigger is removed, but repeated exposure can lead to pulmonary fibrosis. Reference: Harrison’s Principles of Internal Medicine, 21st Edition, Page 2196",

Pigeon Breeder's Lung Seen in occupational history and hypersensitivity pneumonitis Fever with arthralgia Seen in Sarcoidosis Examination Findings Bilateral inspiratory crackles are heard at the base of the lungs Wheeze can be appreciated in conditions like sarcoidosis , Hypersensitivity pneumonitis and Churg Strauss Syndrome. Clubbing Cyanosis Cor pulmonale Raynaud's phenomenon in connective tissue disorder Erythema nodosum in sarcoidosis Dullness to percussion (Statement 3) occurs due to increased density or fluid in the lung or pleural space , disrupting normal resonance. While associated with pleural effusion, consolidation, or masses , it is generally not seen in interstitial lung disease, which involves thickening and scarring of lung tissue rather than fluid accumulation . Increased tactile fremitus (Statement 5) is not true because tactile fremitus is usually decreased in ILD due to thickened interstitial tissue and reduced lung compliance, leading to impaired vibration conduction.",

Chest imaging may show diffuse or patchy infiltrates, but the reversed halo sign is absent. Interstitial pulmonary fibrosis (Option C) is a chronic, progressive, non-reversible lung disease characterised by fibrosis and scarring of the lung parenchyma. It presents with exertional dyspnea and a chronic dry cough. HRCT reveals reticular opacities, honeycombing, and traction bronchiectasis, particularly in the lung bases. Histopathology shows interstitial fibrosis. Acute respiratory distress syndrome (Option D) is a life-threatening lung condition triggered by severe infections, trauma, or systemic insults. It presents with sudden respiratory failure and hypoxemia. Chest imaging typically shows diffuse bilateral infiltrates or ground-glass opacities.

      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: B) Autoimmune response leading to GM-CSF blockade Explanation: In pulmonary alveolar proteinosis (PAP ), autoantibodies against GM-CSF impair the function of alveolar macrophages, preventing them from clearing surfactant and leading to its accumulation in the lungs, resulting in the patient’s symptoms. Pulmonary Alveolar Proteinosis (PAP): It is characterised by impaired function of pulmonary macrophages, primarily due to deficiencies in granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) signalling caused by autoantibodies against GM-CSF leading to the accumulation of surfactant in the alveolar and bronchiolar spaces. Types: (Similar histological changes) Autoimmune PAP: (90% of cases) It primarily affects adults without familial predisposition. Caused by autoantibodies that neutralise GM-CSF function The lack of GM-CSF signalling hinders the maturation of alveolar macrophages, impairing surfactant clearance. Secondary PAP: Rare and associated with various conditions, including: Hematopoietic disorders Malignancies and Immunodeficiencies Lysinuric protein intolerance Acute silicosis and other inhalational syndromes Congenital PAP: Extremely rare and typically seen in neonates Clinical Features: Cough & copious sputum containing gelatinous material. Intermittent febrile episodes due to secondary pulmonary infections Progressive dyspnea, cyanosis and respiratory insufficiency can develop Radiography: Chest x-ray shows bilateral alveolar opacities in a peri-hilar and basilar distribution without air-bronchograms, referred to as a “batwing distribution,” or may resemble pulmonary edema without cardiomegaly or pleural effusions. CT scan r eveals intralobular thickening and diffuse ground-glass opacities, often referred to as “crazy paving.” Deficiency of surfactant proteins due to genetic mutation (Option A): This mechanism is seen in congenital forms of PAP , typically presenting in neonates or infants , not adults. While surfactant protein gene mutations can lead to similar pathology, this is not the usual cause in a 50-year-old adult , making it an unlikely explanation here. Exposure to silica dust causing alveolar damage (Option C): Silica exposure is associated with silicosis , not PAP. However, secondary PAP can occur due to inhalational exposures , but it’s much less common than autoimmune causes. There's no occupational exposure history mentioned here, so this is less likely. Allergic reaction to environmental pollutants (Option D): While pollutants can contribute to airway inflammation or asthma , they do not cause PAP . PAP is not an allergic process but rather a surfactant clearance disorder , so this option is incorrect.

Lung size and weight : Increased due to surfactant accumulation. Ultrastructural analysis: Normal surfactant lamellae in type II pneumocytes, distinguishing PAP from other surfactant dysfunction disorders. Treatment: Whole-lung lavage is the standard treatment and can be beneficial regardless of the underlying cause. GM-CSF therapy is effective in over half of autoimmune PAP cases. GM-CSF replacement therapy is used for congenital forms, sometimes followed by allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation, which may be curative. Increased neutrophilic infiltration (Option A) is more characteristic of acute inflammatory processes, such as infections, than PAP, which typically shows a minimal inflammatory response. Granuloma formation (Option C) indicates conditions like sarcoidosis or infections like TB and is not a feature of PAP. Honeycombing fibrosis (Option D) is associated with advanced interstitial lung diseases, such as idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, rather than the surfactant accumulation seen in PAP.
