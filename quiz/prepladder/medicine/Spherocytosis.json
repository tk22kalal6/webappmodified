      "explanation": "Correct Answer: A) Thalassemia Explanation: Thalassemia presents with severe anemia, characteristic facial deformities, and an increase in fetal hemoglobin (HbF) levels, which is typical of this condition. Thalassemia Thalassemia is a genetic disorder affecting hemoglobin production, causing microcytic, hypochromic anemia. Hemoglobin consists of two alpha ( α ) and two beta ( β ) chains, and mutations in the genes responsible for these chains lead to alpha or beta thalassemia , inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern. The severity depends on the number of affected globin genes. Hemoglobin Structure and Genetics: Hemoglobin (HbA): Made of two α and two β chains. Alpha Globin ( α ): Four genes located on chromosome 16. Beta Globin ( β ): Two genes located on chromosome 11. Types and Subtypes of Thalassemia: Alpha Thalassemia ( α -thalassemia): Caused by deletions or mutations in the HBA1 and HBA2 genes on chromosome 16, affecting α chain production. The severity depends on how many of the four α genes are affected: Silent Carrier (1 gene deletion) Alpha Thalassemia Trait ( α -thalassemia minor) (2 gene deletions) Hemoglobin H Disease (3 gene deletions) Hemoglobin Bart’s Hydrops Fetalis (4 gene deletions) Beta Thalassemia ( β -thalassemia): Caused by mutations in the HBB gene on chromosome 11, affecting β chain production. The severity depends on whether one or both β genes are mutated: Beta Thalassemia Trait ( β -thalassemia minor) (1 mutated gene) Beta Thalassemia Intermedia (2 mutated genes with partial function) Beta Thalassemia Major ( β 0-thalassemia) (2 mutated genes, with complete absence of β chain production) Symptoms of Thalassemia: Fatigue, weakness, and lethargy (due to anemia) Pallor (pale skin) and jaundice (yellow skin and eyes) Delayed growth and development in children Skeletal deformities (e.g., frontal bossing, depressed nasal bridge, protruding maxilla), \"thalassemic facies\" or \"monkey facies\" Splenomegaly (enlarged spleen) and hepatomegaly (enlarged liver) Frequent infections (especially after splenectomy) Iron overload (from repeated transfusions , causing heart, liver, and endocrine damage) Autoimmune hemolytic anemia (Option B) : This condition typically shows evidence of hemolysis (e.g., elevated reticulocyte count, positive Coombs test) and may not present with the characteristic facial features or elevated HbF levels seen in thalassemia.

This form is characterized by severe anemia, pallor, and jaundice in infancy due to ineffective erythropoiesis and hemolysis. Beta thalassemia Beta thalassemia results from mutations in the HBB gene on chromosome 11, which encodes the beta globin chains. Humans have two beta globin genes, and mutations in one or both genes lead to different severities of beta-thalassemia.

      "correct_answer": "D",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: D) All of the above. Explanation: Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT), lentiviral gene therapy, and luspatercept are all aimed at improving the quality of life and reducing the need for frequent transfusions in patients with transfusion-dependent beta-thalassemia. Management of ß Thalassemia: For optimal effectiveness, transfusions and iron chelation must be initiated early, remain consistent, and continue throughout life. Blood Transfusion: Packed red blood cell transfusion. Transfusion is done every 2-4 weeks. Pretransfusion target hemoglobin concentration: 9-10.5 g/dL. To prevent immunological reactions: Leucoreduced packed red blood cells with a minimum haemoglobin content of 40g should be given. The lifespan of transfused RBC: 60 days. Iron Chelation: 1 unit of transfused blood contains: 200-250 mg of iron. Iron chelation is necessary to prevent toxic iron accumulation from transfusions. Effective in preventing the development of cardiomyopathy and endocrinopathies associated with transfusions. Oral chelators: Deferasirox and deferiprone. Intravenous chelator: Deferoxamine. Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation (HSCT): (Option A) HSCT improves quality of life compared to transfusions and chelation. Curative in over 80% of cases with matched sibling donors Improving Ineffective Erythropoiesis: (Option C) Luspatercept is approved for treating transfusion-dependent thalassemia. It enhances late-stage erythropoiesis. Reduces transfusion needs by 33%. Gene Therapy: (Option B) Lentiviral gene therapy with autologous CD34+ hematopoietic stem cells Splenectomy: Performed if splenomegaly causes mechanical complications or when there is a high demand for transfusions.

      "explanation": "β 4 tetramers, leading to unstable hemoglobin Correct Answer: B) Formation of β 4 tetramers, leading to unstable haemoglobin Explanation: In HbH disease, the lack of α -globin chains results in an excess of unpaired β -globin chains . These β -globin chains form β 4 tetramers (HbH) , which are unstable and precipitate within red blood cells, forming inclusion bodies that are shown in the peripheral smear. This leads to hemolysis and ineffective erythropoiesis, explaining the infant’s anaemia and clinical presentation. Alpha thalassemia It is an Autosomal recessive inheritance. It is most common in Southern China and Southeast Asia. Classification : Normal individuals have four α -globin genes (two per chromosome 16 ).

      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "α -globin genes Correct Answer: B) Deletion of all four α -globin genes Explanation: The scenario indicates α -thalassemia due to severe anaemia (Hb: 6 g/dL) from insufficient α -globin production and elevated indirect bilirubin, suggesting hemolysis. Hepatosplenomegaly results from increased erythropoiesis and splenic sequestration. A reticulocyte count of 12% reflects the bone marrow's compensatory response. The rapid onset of symptoms in the newborn aligns with severe α -thalassemia, especially from the deletion of all four α -globin genes . Hb Bart Hydrops Fetalis Syndrome The most severe form of α -thalassemia, caused by the absence of all four α -globin genes (homozygous α 0-thalassemia). Common in Southeast Asia : High frequency due to the prevalence of α 0-thalassemia. Pathophysiology Fetuses with α 0-thalassemia mainly produce Hb Bart ( γ 4) , which is ineffective for oxygen transport. Small amounts of embryonic haemoglobins (Hbs Portland 1 and 2) allow survival until late pregnancy. Clinical Course Characterized by severe anaemia (Hb 3-8 g/dL), hepatosplenomegaly, generalized oedema , heart failure, and extramedullary erythropoiesis. Associated congenital abnormalities include skeletal, cardiovascular, and urogenital defects. Pregnancy Complications Maternal : Preeclampsia, polyhydramnios or oligohydramnios, antepartum haemorrhage. Postpartum : Retained placenta, eclampsia, haemorrhage, anaemia, sepsis. Management Intrauterine erythrocyte transfusions and hematopoietic stem cell transplantation have uncertain benefits due to developmental risks. Early termination of at-risk pregnancies is advised due to severe complications. Universal prenatal screening programs have been implemented to detect homozygous α -thalassemia. Deletion of three α -globin genes (Option A) would lead to Hemoglobin H disease, which typically presents with less severe symptoms than observed in this infant. Increased β -globin chain synthesis (Option C) is seen in β -thalassemia but does not explain the acute symptoms, as the absence of α -globin would lead to the formation of unstable tetramers ( β 4) rather than healthy haemoglobin. Mutation in the G6PD gene (Option D) causes hemolytic anaemia primarily triggered by oxidative stress, rather than presenting acutely with severe anaemia and jaundice in a newborn.

      "explanation": "Correct Answer: B) Deficiency of Ankyrin Explanation: Ankyrin deficiency is the most common defect in hereditary spherocytosis , accounting for approximately 50% to 70% of cases. Ankyrin is critical for maintaining the connection between the cytoskeletal framework and the lipid bilayer of RBC. Its deficiency leads to the formation of spherocytes, which are less deformable and more prone to splenic destruction, causing hemolysis , consistent with the patient's clinical features. Hereditary Spherocytosis (HS) An inherited disorder caused by intrinsic defects in the red blood cell membrane skeleton, leading to spheroid, less deformable red cells vulnerable to splenic sequestration and destruction. 75% of cases are autosomal dominant . Remaining cases often involve severe forms due to compound heterozygosity (inheritance of two different defects).

Spherocytes have decreased deformability , resulting in their retention and destruction in the spleen , causing hemolysis. spectrin , ankyrin, AE1(band 3) , protein 4.2 that weakens the vertical connections between the cytoskeletal framework and lipid bilayer. The ANK1 gene on chromosome 8p produces Ankyrin . Two proposed mechanisms for membrane loss: In cells with spectrin/ankyrin deficiency . Reduced AE1/protein . Clinical features 60-70% of patients present with moderate disease, typically in infancy or childhood. Common findings in children include: Anaemia may be asymptomatic, Jaundice is usually intermittent and acholuric (unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia). >75% show palpable splenomegaly . Family history. Complications Gallbladder Disease : Chronic hemolysis can lead to bilirubinate gallstones . Crisis Events : Hemolytic Crisis : Commonly associated with viral illnesses in childhood; typically mild and self-resolving. Aplastic Crisis : Rare but may cause severe anaemia and require hospitalization, often linked to parvovirus infection. Typically lasts 10–14 days and may reveal undiagnosed HS in asymptomatic patients. Megaloblastic Crisis : Occurs in patients with increased folate needs, preventable by supplementation. Other rare complications may include leg ulcers , chronic dermatitis, and skeletal abnormalities. HS has been associated with increased risks of hematologic malignancies and thrombotic events post-splenectomy. Deficiency of beta-spectrin (Option A) causes Elliptocytosis. AE1 (Band 3) (Option D) is involved in anion exchange and helps maintain cell shape & Protein 4.2 (Option C) maintains red blood cell membrane integrity.

      },
      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: C) Decreased serum haptoglobin Explanation: The presence of spherocytes and elevated MCHC i n the patient's blood film, along with anaemia symptoms, indicates hereditary spherocytosis . Increased hemolysis leads to the release of free haemoglobin into the bloodstream, causing haptoglobin levels to decrease due to its binding and consumption during this process. Laboratory features of Hereditary Spherocytosis Blood Film Erythrocyte morphology in HS is inconsistent, often showing spherocytes lacking central pallor. Patients with AE1/ BAND3 defects may exhibit \"pincered\" or mushroom-shaped red cells. Erythrocyte Indices Mild to moderate anemia (Hb - 90–120 g/L). Mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration (MCHC) is elevated (>36 g/dL) due to cellular dehydration in about half of the patients. Increased red cell distribution width. Mean corpuscular volume (MCV) is decreased in severe cases. Markers of Hemolysis Laboratory features include reticulocytosis (Option D) , elevated lactate dehydrogenase (Option B) , increased urinary and fecal urobilinogen, unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia, and decreased serum haptoglobin . Direct Coombs Test - Negative (Option A) INVESTIGATIONS: Erythrocyte Fragility Tests Spherocytes are osmotically fragile due to decreased surface area relative to volume. The osmotic fragility test measures red cell lysis in hypotonic sodium chloride solutions; spherocytes burst at higher concentrations than normal cells. Other tests, such as glycerol lysis tests , have poor sensitivity. Eosin 5 ′ -Maleimide (EMA) Flow Cytometry Test EMA is a fluorescent dye that binds to specific transmembrane proteins (AE1, Rh protein, Rh glycoprotein, CD47). HS patients exhibit decreased fluorescence compared to controls. Advanced Diagnostic Methods Sodium Dodecyl Sulfate Polyacrylamide Gel Electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) : SDS-PAGE identifies defective membrane proteins by separating and analyzing their quantities.

      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: C) Laparoscopic splenectomy Explanation: Laparoscopic splenectomy is the best treatment for a 7-year-old with hereditary spherocytosis (HS) requiring recurrent transfusions. It improves anemia by prolonging red cell survival, reducing transfusion needs, and preventing complications like iron overload . Since the patient is older than 5 , the risk of post-splenectomy sepsis is lower, making this the ideal surgical approach due to quicker recovery and fewer complications. Management of Hereditary Spherocytosis (HS) Splenectomy as Primary Treatment (Option C) Splenectomy significantly improves anemia by prolonging red cell survival, reducing the need for transfusions, and preventing iron overload and related organ damage. Post splenectomy: Spherocytosis and altered osmotic fragility persist, but reticulocyte counts and erythrocyte lifespan normalize. Blood Film Changes Post-Splenectomy Features like Howell-Jolly bodies , acanthocytes, target cells, cabot ring and Pappenheimer bodies appear after splenectomy. Indications for Splenectomy Recommended for patients with severe, transfusion-dependent anemia, growth failure, skeletal changes, leg ulcers, or extramedullary hematopoietic tumours. Timing of Splenectomy : Should be delayed until age 5–9 if possible (Option B) , or at least age 3, to reduce the risk of post-splenectomy sepsis while balancing the increased risk of gallstones in older children. Laparoscopic Splenectomy Preferred method, with benefits like less discomfort, quicker recovery, and shorter hospital stays. Combined laparoscopic splenectomy and cholecystectomy is an option for patients with symptomatic gallstones. Partial Splenectomy Used in infants or young children to alleviate anemia while preserving some splenic immune function. It reduces transfusion needs but may eventually require total splenectomy in about half of patients. Pre- and Post-Splenectomy Care Vaccination : Patients should receive vaccines against pneumococcus, Haemophilus influenzae type B, and meningococcus before surgery. Antibiotic Prophylaxis : Use of prophylactic antibiotics post-splenectomy is controversial but recommended by some for at least 5 years or even lifelong. Folic Acid : Continued supplementation (1 mg/day) is recommended to prevent folate deficiency. Bone marrow transplant (Option A) is not indicated in HS, as the condition is caused by a red cell membrane defect, not bone marrow failure. Erythropoietin (Option D) is ineffective in HS, as the issue is not a lack of red cell production but their premature destruction. Thus, it would not address the underlying problem.",
