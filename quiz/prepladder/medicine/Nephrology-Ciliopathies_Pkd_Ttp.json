      "explanation": "Correct Answer: B) Dysfunction of polycystin proteins on the primary cilium Explanation: Mutations in PKD1 (polycystin-1) or PKD2 (polycystin-2) lead to the dysfunction of these proteins on the primary cilium, which disrupts calcium signalling and promotes cyst formation. ADPKD- Introduction and aetiology Formation of epithelial-lined cysts in kidneys affecting ~5% of tubules. Despite the small number, cyst growth disrupts surrounding tissue, leading to loss of kidney function. It is autosomal dominant with full penetrance but variable expressivity. Bilaterally enlarged kidneys with cortical and medullary cysts are seen Key defects: (Option D ruled out) Increased cell proliferation and fluid secretion Decreased cell differentiation Abnormal extracellular matrix Genetic Heterogeneity PKD1 mutations: ~85% of cases. PKD2 mutations: ~15% (milder clinical presentation). Other genes: GANAB and DNAJB11 (rare cases, affecting polycystin-1 trafficking). Genetics Caused by mutations in PKD1 (polycystin-1) and PKD2 (polycystin-2). PKD1: large G-protein coupled receptor. PKD2: calcium channel protein. Polycystin proteins interact on the primary cilium . (Option C) Dysfunction leads to impaired calcium signalling and cyst formation. Molecular Mechanisms Polycystin-1 and -2 Complex: Forms a receptor-channel complex involved in calcium signalling and G-protein regulation. Affects processes like cell cycle, cytoskeleton organization, and cell migration. Disruption leads to abnormal calcium signalling, and increased cAMP, promoting cyst growth via chloride and aquaporin channels . (Option A and C ruled out) Cyst Formation \"Second hit\" mutation in normal PKD1/ PKD2 allele leads to cyst formation. Partial loss of function initiates cyst growth, accelerated by renal injury or genetic/epigenetic changes. Reference: Harrison’s Principles of Internal Medicine, 21st Edition, Page: 2350, 2351.",

      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: A) Prednisolone Explanation: The laboratory findings suggest thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP). The mainstay of treatment in TTP is plasma exchange (PEX) with high-dose corticosteroid therapy(Prednisolone). Diagnosis : Laboratory evaluation plays a critically important role in diagnosing TTP because signs and symptoms are variable, and end-organ damage can be delayed. Anaemia and thrombocytopenia, along with an indication of active hemolysis. Presence of schistocytes Increased unconjugated bilirubin Increased reticulocyte count and increased lactate dehydrogenase. PLASMIC SCORE for TTP diagnosis: The presence of peripheral schistocytes is required to apply to this score. Features Points Platelet Count < 30,000/microlitre 1 Reticulocyte count > 2.5% 1 Indirect bilirubin > 2mg/dL 1 MCV < 90fL 1 INR < 1.5 1 Creatinine < 2 mg/dL 1 Undetectable Haptoglobin 1 Score > 5 = High probability of TTP Score < 5 = Low probability of TTP. Treatment Plasma exchange (PEX) with high-dose corticosteroid therapy. The mainstay of treatment in TTP Corticosteroids operate by decreasing the activity of the reticuloendothelial system as well as decreasing autoantibody production. Both the ultra-large VWF multimers and the ADAMTS13 autoantibodies are effectively removed from circulation by plasma exchange therapy. The recommended volume of exchange is one estimated plasma volume (usually 40 mL/kg of body weight) with each treatment. The recommended dose for corticosteroids is 1 mg/kg per day of prednisolone. Rituximab An anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody was found to help treat TTP refractory to PEX. It targets B-lymphocytes and has a good response rate in refractory and relapsed TTP. Caplacizumab It has a high potential for TTP. It is a humanized monoclonal antibody fragment (a bivalent, variable-domain-only fragment) that attacks the A1 section of VWF and prevents platelet adhesion. Other Splenectomy, vincristine, cyclosporine and cyclophosphamide. Rituximab ( Option B ) is an option for refractory or relapsing TTP but is not typically part of the initial treatment.

      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: A) Hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS) Explanation : Hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS) is the most likely diagnosis, given the history of recent diarrhoea (commonly due to Shiga toxin-producing E. coli) , acute kidney injury (elevated creatinine), thrombocytopenia, and microangiopathic hemolytic anaemia (schistocytes and elevated LDH). uremic syndrome (HUS) \" data-author=\"NA\" data-hash=\"8546\" data-license=\"NA\" data-source=\"NA\" data-tags=\"\" height=\"446\" src=\"https://image.prepladder.com/notes/2pM1DLNXHuhS7hzNM5WE1744291362.png\" width=\"655\" /> Hemolytic uremic syndrome Thrombotic microangiopathy (TMA) is characterised by thrombocytopenia, microangiopathic hemolytic anaemia, and acute kidney injury. HUS is most commonly caused by Shiga toxin (typical HUS) or, less commonly, infections or genetic abnormalities activating the alternative complement pathway (atypical HUS). Aetiology Based Classification: Types Description Typical HUS/ D+HUS Shiga toxin-producing Escherichia coli (STEC), called typical HUS, is the most common cause of HUS. Escherichia coli 0157:H7 (E coli 0157:H7) has been linked to typical HUS. Typical HUS comprises 90% to 95% of HUS. Commonly arises from consuming contaminated food or drink and through person-to-person contact. It has low morbidity compared to atypical HUS. Atypical HUS/ D-HUS The cause of aHUS is the abnormal activation of the alternative complement pathway. The alternative complement pathway is activated with particular emphasis on regulatory Factor H, stabilises C3, and inactivates C3b. Secondary HUS HUS secondary to underlying conditions or infections, commonly presenting as aHUS with abnormal complement system activation. The most significant component of this category is HUS caused by Streptococcus pneumoniae. Caused by Inherited vitamin B12 metabolism disorder, HIV, influenza virus and malignant hypertension. Clinical manifestations: The typical patient is a child younger than 5 with painful diarrhoea and abdominal cramping between 1 and 10 days after exposure to STEC, with fever and vomiting also present. HUS generally begins 5 to 13 days after the start of diarrhoea. HUS symptoms include renal symptoms, such as anuria, oliguria, and fluid overload, and symptoms related to anaemia, such as syncope, fatigue, and pallor. Petechiae and easy bleeding may be notable due to thrombocytopenia. In adult patients, neurological symptoms such as confusion, seizures, and coma are markedly more prevalent than in children. Clinical presentation of aHUS is usually nonspecific symptoms such as fatigue, and pallor, which can progress to signs of acute kidney injury (AKI), such as oliguria, uremia, and fluid overload.",

        "D": "Rituximab"
      },
      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: A) Eculizumab Explanation : Eculizumab is the first-line treatment for atypical HUS. Treatment: Types Treatment Typical HUS Management of typical HUS caused by STEC is generally supportive. Patients are often volume-depleted, and less volume resuscitation has been linked to an increased need for renal replacement therapy. Blood transfusions and platelet transfusions are provided to avoid thrombotic complications. Antimotility agents and antibiotics are avoided in typical HUS caused by STEC, as they correlate with poorer outcomes, likely due to heightened Shiga toxin exposure. If S dysenteriae or S pneumonia is present, early antibiotics are given to improve the outcomes. Atypical HUS The cornerstones of treatment for aHUS are first-line treatment with eculizumab and second-line with plasma exchange. Eculizumab is a recombinant monoclonal antibody that targets the C5 component of complement activation by preventing its cleavage. Ravulizumab is a new C5 inhibitor that binds to C5 preventing cleavage and it has similar efficacy to eculizumab but with 4 times as long of a half-life. Adverse effects of eculizumab are infection by encapsulated organisms such as S pneumoniae and Haemophilus influenzae, and all patients should be given appropriate vaccines and monitored. Secondary HUS Depends on the treatment of the underlying condition. Eculizumab has some efficacy in treating pregnancy-related secondary HUS. Ravulizumab (Option B): Considered a second option after eculizumab, depending on clinical needs. Cyclophosphamide (Option C): This is an immunosuppressant used for autoimmune and malignant conditions, but it is not indicated for aHUS. Rituximab (Option D): Targets CD20 on B cells and is used in conditions like autoimmune diseases and lymphomas, but it is not a primary treatment for aHUS. Reference: HUS",

      "explanation": "Correct answer: C) Polycythemia Explanation: The condition associated with UMOD gene mutation is Autosomal Dominant Tubulo-interstitial Kidney Disease (ADTKD) - earlier known as Medullary Cystic Kidney Disease (MCKD). Anaemia is associated with ADTKD (NOT polycythemia) ADTKD: Description Group of inherited renal disorder characterised by Tubulo-interstitial nephropathy and bland urinary sediments. Genes UMOD (Uromodulin) MUC-1 (Mucin) Other genes: REN (Renin), HNF1 β (Hepatocyte nuclear factor) Inheritance Autosomal dominant pattern Manifestations/ Complications Polyuria: Tubulointerstitial disorders have a non-oliguric presentation (Option A) anaemia: Peritubular cell damage → ↓ Erythropoietin levels (Option C) CKD/ESRD: Due to progressive renal damage Gout: usual presentation in adults, mainly in ADTKD-UMOD (Option D) Hypovolemia: mainly seen in ADTKD-REN Liver damage: mainly seen in ADTKD-HNF1 β Diagnosis Urine examination: Bland urinary sediments - most specific finding (RBC/WBC/Epithelial casts) (Option B) USG: Shrunken kidneys Histopathology: Tubular atrophy, tubulointerstitial fibrosis Management Anti-gout drugs: Allopurinol and Febuxostat are mainly useful in ADTKD-UMOD.
