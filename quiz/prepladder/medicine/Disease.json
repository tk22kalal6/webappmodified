      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: A) Acute inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy (AIDP) Explanation: Acute inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy (AIDP) is the most common variant of GBS in Europe and North America and is often preceded by infections, aligning with the patient’s recent gastrointestinal illness. Causes of Guillain-Barré Syndrome (GBS): Aspect Details Definition A group of immune-mediated conditions causing acute paralysis, with the most common variant being acute inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy (AIDP). Incidence 1–2 cases per 100,000 individuals per year. Common Preceding Infections About two-thirds of AIDP cases have a prior history of infection, often triggering an autoimmune response leading to demyelination. Variants of Guillain-Barré Syndrome: Variant Description Acute Inflammatory Demyelinating Polyneuropathy (AIDP) The most common variant is in Europe & North America. Patchy segmental demyelination of spinal cord and peripheral nerves Antibodies seen: IgG Anti GM1 IgG Anti GQ1b Axonal Variants (Option B ruled out) More prevalent in China and Japan; account for 10% of GBS cases in Western countries; often associated with Campylobacter jejuni infection. Miller Fisher Syndrome (Option C ruled out) Best-recognised variant. Associated with anti-GQ1b antibodies. Presents with internal and external ophthalmoplegia, ataxia, and areflexia. Clinical Course: Weakness progresses over a maximum of 4 weeks (usually less). Can lead to respiratory failure within hours. Chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy (CIDP) (Option D): A chronic condition not consistent with the acute presentation observed in this patient.

        "D": "Specific autoantibodies are only directed against gangliosides, with no other targets identified in"
      },
      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "immune mechanisms contribute to GBS pathology. Correct Answer: C) A diverse array of autoantibodies targeting nerve components suggests multiple immune mechanisms contribute to GBS pathology. Explanation: Patients with Guillain-Barré syndrome (GBS) produce various autoantibodies that attack different components of the nervous system. The presence of these multiple autoantibodies indicates that the underlying immune response is not uniform; it involves different mechanisms that can lead to nerve damage. This diversity suggests that GBS may arise from a complex interplay of immune processes rather than a single pathway, contributing to the variability in clinical presentations and outcomes among patients. Autoantibodies in Guillain-Barré Syndrome (GBS): Aspect Details Diversity of Autoantibodies GBS patients exhibit a wide range of autoantibodies targeting nerve cells and structures, indicating multiple immune mechanisms may contribute to GBS pathology. Prevalence of Anti-Ganglioside Antibodies (Option A ruled out) Anti-ganglioside antibodies are the most common , detected in up to 50% of GBS patients, often arising from microbial molecular mimicry. Prognostic Implications (Option B ruled out) Specific autoantibodies, especially anti-GM1 , are associated with poorer clinical outcomes. Presence correlates with variants like pure motor variants and Miller-Fisher syndrome. Target Antigens (Option D ruled out) While gangliosides are primary targets, other potential targets include nodal and paranodal proteins (e.g., neurofascin), suggesting a broader spectrum of autoantibody involvement. Clinical-Immunological Correlations Research aims to establish correlations between GBS clinical presentations and specific autoantibodies, enhancing understanding of immune responses in relation to patient outcomes. Conclusion: The study emphasizes the complexity of autoantibody involvement in GBS, suggesting that understanding these immune markers could enhance diagnosis and treatment strategies for affected individuals.

Category Symptoms Motor Symptoms Progressive ascending paralysis (distal to proximal) Areflexia Weakness in legs causing rubbery legs and instability to stand Truncal paralysis, quadriplegia, neck floppiness Bilateral 7th nerve palsy Bulbar palsy Difficulty in handling secretions leading to aspiration pneumonia A leading cause of death due to pulmonary involvement. Diaphragmatic paralysis Ventilatory support is required in 30% of cases. Increased carbon dioxide levels. Sensory Symptoms Glove-and-stocking distribution paresthesias Proprioception loss Difficulty in climbing stairs Pain in the neck/arm/shoulder is similar to over-exercised muscle Sensory manifestations can occur before or along with motor manifestations. Autonomic Symptoms Autonomic dysregulation (e.g., orthostatic hypotension, bladder/bowel sparing/transient involvement) Wide fluctuations of blood pressure, arrhythmias, postural hypotension Reduced heart rate and blood pressure, neurogenic shock. Tick paralysis (Option B) can cause ascending flaccid paralysis and is associated with recent tick exposure . The neurotoxins present in the tick's saliva act on the presynaptic nerve terminals, leading to a gradual onset of ascending flaccid paralysis . It also improves quickly with tick removal & presents with normal CSF findings unlike elevated protein in this case Myasthenia gravis (Option C): Causes fluctuating weakness that worsens with activity and is often accompanied by ocular symptoms (e.g., ptosis, diplopia).

      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: A) Acute pharyngeal cervicobrachial neuropathy Explanation: The diagnosis is Acute pharyngeal cervicobrachial Neuropathy . This condition is characterized by oropharyngeal and cervicobrachial weakness, often with areflexia in the upper limbs. It is triggered by viral infections like dengue. The normal MRI findings and elevated protein in cerebrospinal fluid further support this diagnosis. Pharyngeal-Cervical-Brachial (PCB) Variant of Guillain–Barré Syndrome Description: Rare localized variant of Guillain–Barré syndrome. Aetiology: Associated with anti-GT1a antibodies. Onset: Paralysis typically begins in the arms. Clinical Features: Rapidly progressive oropharyngeal and cervicopharyngeal weakness. Areflexia in the upper limbs. Affects neck muscles and throat. Diagnosis: Features Required for Diagnosis: Symmetrical weakness in the oropharyngeal, neck, and arms, with areflexia. Absence of ataxia, altered consciousness, and significant leg weakness. A monophasic illness with a clinical plateau occurring within 12 hours to 28 days after onset. Exclusion of alternative diagnoses like brainstem stroke, botulism, and myasthenia gravis. Features Strongly Supportive of the Diagnosis: Antecedent infection (upper respiratory or gastrointestinal symptoms). CSF albuminocytological dissociation (high protein with normal cell count). Neurophysiological evidence of neuropathy Presence of IgG anti-GT1a or anti-GQ1b antibodies Treatment: Conservative Management: Supportive care and close monitoring, without the need for IVIg or plasmapheresis, in patients with no respiratory compromise or rapid progression IVIg or Plasmapheresis: These treatments are typically reserved for severe or rapidly progressing cases of GBS. Monitoring and Follow-Up: Close monitoring of respiratory function is essential in GBS, especially with bulbar involvement. Follow-up at 4 weeks showed recovery of deep tendon reflexes and normalization of motor function . Miller Fisher syndrome (Option B): typically presents with a triad of ophthalmoplegia, ataxia, and areflexia. Multiple sclerosis (Option C) usually shows distinct clinical features like visual disturbances and sensory deficits, and MRI would typically reveal lesions . Botulism (Option D): the specific findings of elevated protein with normal glucose in the CSF suggest PCB over botulism.

      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: B) Memantine Explanation: A common approach to Alzheimer's disease drug therapy is to initiate a cholinesterase inhibitor for a patient diagnosed with mild AD dementia and to add memantine when patients enter the moderate stage of the disease. Treatment of Alzheimer’s disease Patient and caregiver education. Neurotransmitter-based therapies Acetylcholinesterase inhibitors Donepezil Rivastigmine (Option A ruled out) Galantamine (Option D ruled out) N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) glutamate receptor blocker Memantine A common approach to AD drug therapy is to initiate a cholinesterase inhibitor for a patient diagnosed with mild AD dementia and to add memantine when patients enter the moderate stage of the disease. (Option B) Therapies targeting amyloid- I Aducanumab MOA: Monoclonal antibody targeting the N-terminus of the A β peptide Dosage: Intravenous infusion every 4 weeks (7 infusions in total) Should only be considered for treating MCI (Mild Cognitive Impairment) or early dementia due to AD (Option C ruled out) S/E: Vasogenic cerebral oedema, cortical microhemorrhages, and superficial siderosis Reference: Harrison’s Principle of Internal Medicine, 21st Edition, Page: 3374.",
