      "question": "A lung cancer patient has hyperpigmentation of palmar and sole creases. Which of the following is responsible for this presentation?",
      "options": {
        "A": "MSH",
        "B": "C-peptide",
        "C": "Neuropeptide Y",
        "D": "Melanin"
      },
      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: A) MSH Explanation: The clinical manifestations indicate Ectopic Cushing's syndrome , a paraneoplastic syndrome commonly associated with lung cancer. Proopiomelanocortin (POMC) produced by the tumor is cleaved to form Melanocyte Stimulating Hormone (MSH) and ACTH , leading to hyperpigmentation. This process represents one of the most common hormonally-induced paraneoplastic syndromes in small cell lung cancer (SCLC). Ectopic Cushing's Syndrome Definition ACTH production from non-pituitary sources leading to Cushing's syndrome Epidemiology Accounts for 10-20% of cases of Cushing's syndrome Common Sources Small cell lung cancer (most common) Bronchial and thymic carcinoids Islet tumors Pheochromocytomas Medullary thyroid carcinomas Pathophysiology Increased expression of POMC gene from non-pituitary sources Production of MSH , β -lipotropin, and other POMC-derived peptides Production of ACTH fragments Clinical Features Hyperglycemia Marked fluid retention Hyperpigmentation manifestations due to MSH Less marked weight gain compared to pituitary Cushing's Centripetal fat redistribution Hypertension Hypokalemia Metabolic alkalosis Glucose intolerance Diagnosis Very high ACTH levels (typically >2-3 times normal) No response to high-dose dexamethasone suppression Treatment Treatment of underlying malignancy Glucocorticoid receptor blockers Steroidogenesis inhibitors Management of complications (diabetes, hypokalemia) Key Distinctions from Pituitary Cushing's Higher ACTH levels No response to dexamethasone suppression More rapid onset More severe metabolic complications C-peptide (Option B) is a byproduct formed during the conversion of proinsulin to insulin. It has no role in the hyperpigmentation seen in paraneoplastic syndromes associated with lung cancer. Neuropeptide Y (Option C) is involved in appetite regulation through hypothalamic signaling. This peptide does not contribute to the hyperpigmentation observed in paraneoplastic syndromes. Melanin (Option D) is the end product of melanogenesis responsible for skin pigmentation. While it is the final pigment, the question asks about the hormone responsible for triggering the hyperpigmentation, which is MSH.

      "question": "Which of the following mutations is associated with the Philadelphia chromosome?",
      "options": {
        "A": "Inversion",
        "B": "Insertion",
        "C": "Reciprocal translocation",
        "D": "Deletion"
      },
      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: C) Reciprocal translocation Explanation: The Philadelphia chromosome is a balanced translocation between the long arm of chromosomes 9 and 22 [t(9;22)(q34.1;q11.2)] . It is present in the majority of patients with chronic myeloid leukaemia (CML). Formation of Philadelphia chromosome: A balanced translocation is a type of chromosomal rearrangement in which segments of two different chromosomes break and exchange places without any loss of genetic material. In the case of CML, a segment of chromosome 9 containing the ABL gene ( Abelson Leukemia) , located at the q34 region, moves to chromosome 22. Similarly, the segment of chromosome 22 containing the BCR gene (breakpoint cluster region) , located at the q11 region, moves to chromosome 9. This exchange results in the formation of two derivative chromosomes: one with the truncated chromosome 9 segment and the BCR-ABL fusion gene and the other with the truncated chromosome 22 segment. The chromosome containing the BCR-ABL fusion gene is known as the Philadelphia chromosome. The BCR-ABL fusion forms a novel oncoprotein called p210 bcr-abl-1 (210 = molecular weight in kiloDalton—210 kDa). Inversion (Option A) occurs when a segment of DNA breaks away from the chromosome, flips around, and reattaches in the reverse orientation. This is not the mechanism involved in Philadelphia chromosome formation. Insertion (Option B) involves the addition of extra nucleotides into a DNA sequence. This type of mutation can cause frameshift mutations but is not responsible for the Philadelphia chromosome. Deletion (Option D) results in the loss of a segment of DNA from a chromosome. While deletions are important mutations, they do not cause the formation of the Philadelphia chromosome, which involves an exchange of genetic material between chromosomes.",

      "question": "Most common cause of hypercalcemia in a hospitalized patient is:",
      "options": {
        "A": "Malignancy",
        "B": "Parathyroid Adenoma",
        "C": "Parathyroid hyperplasia",
        "D": "Follicular thyroid CA"
      },
      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer A - Malignancy The most common cause of hypercalcemia in a hospitalized patient is malignancy . In malignancy-associated hypercalcemia, the disease is usually not occult; rather, symptoms of malignancy bring the patient to the physician, and hypercalcemia is discovered during the evaluation. In such patients, the interval between detection of hypercalcemia and death, especially without vigorous treatment, is often <6 months. Hypercalcemic crisis Aetiology: Hypercalcemia of malignancy Paraneoplastic syndromes in Squamous cell carcinoma of lungs Breast carcinoma Parathyroid adenoma Sarcoidosis Vitamin D toxicity Milk alkali syndrome Jansen disease: Autosomal dominant defect in PTHR-1 leading to receptor gain mutation (hyperactive receptor) Lithium toxicity: Causes diabetes insipidus and activation of parathyroid glands. Familial hypocalciuric hypercalcemia: Autosomal dominant defect in CaSR receptor in parathyroid and kidneys, which leads to excess PTH secretion Investigations: Serum electrolytes: ↑ calcium and ↓ phosphate. ↑ Serum alkaline phosphatase. ↑↑↑ Serum PTH in cases of parathyroid adenoma Treatment: Aggressive hydration with normal saline: First-line management to correct dehydration and promote renal calcium excretion. Forced diuresis with loop diuretics: Can be used after adequate hydration to enhance calcium excretion in the urine. Intravenous Zoledronate: Drug of choice for lowering calcium. It begins to act within 1-2 days and lasts up to 3 weeks. Calcitonin: Promotes calcium deposition in bones but may develop tachyphylaxis (reduced response over time). Denosumab: Inhibits osteoclast differentiation by binding to RANK ligand, reducing bone resorption. Peritoneal dialysis: Indicated in renal failure, it can rapidly reverse life-threatening hypercalcemia. Parathyroid Adenoma (Option B): Primary hyperparathyroidism, most commonly due to a parathyroid adenoma, is the leading cause of hypercalcemia in the outpatient setting rather than hospitalized patients. It leads to increased secretion of parathyroid hormone (PTH), causing increased calcium resorption from bones and reduced renal calcium excretion. Parathyroid Hyperplasia (Option C): Parathyroid hyperplasia causes primary hyperparathyroidism, but it is less common than parathyroid adenoma. It is associated with multiple endocrine neoplasia (MEN) syndromes, particularly MEN 1 and MEN 2A. Like adenomas, it is more commonly seen in outpatient settings rather than as a cause of acute hypercalcemia in hospitalized patients. Follicular Thyroid Carcinoma (Option D): While follicular thyroid carcinoma can sometimes lead to bone metastases, resulting in hypercalcemia, it is not a common cause. Hypercalcemia from malignancy is more often seen in cancers that secrete PTHrP (e.g., squamous cell lung cancer) or cause direct bone destruction (e.g., multiple myeloma).

      "question": "Which of the options listed below is utilized for the treatment of tumor lysis syndrome?",
      "options": {
        "A": "a.Rasburicase",
        "B": "b.Rituximab",
        "C": "c.Gemtuzumab",
        "D": "d.Alemtuzumab"
      },
      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "occur in patients with tumor lysis syndrome. Tumor lysis syndrome is a complication that can occur in patients with cancer, usually after the initiation of chemotherapy, radiation, or immunotherapy. When cancer cells die, they release their contents into the bloodstream, which can cause high levels of potassium, phosphate, and uric acid in the blood. High levels of uric acid can lead to kidney damage and other complications. Rasburicase is an enzyme that converts uric acid into a more soluble form that can be excreted in the urine, thus preventing the formation of uric acid crystals, and reducing the risk of kidney damage. Incorrect choices: Option B: Rituximab is a monoclonal antibody used to treat certain types of cancer, such as non-Hodgkin's lymphoma and chronic lymphocytic leukemia. It works by targeting and destroying B cells, which are cancerous in these types of cancer. It is not typically used in the management of tumor lysis syndrome. Option C: Gemtuzumab is a monoclonal antibody used to treat acute myeloid leukemia (AML) in certain cases. It works by targeting a protein on the surface of leukemia cells, which causes the cells to die. It is not typically used in the management of tumor lysis syndrome. Option D: Alemtuzumab is a monoclonal antibody used to treat certain types of cancer, such as chronic lymphocytic leukemia and some types of lymphoma. It works by targeting and destroying certain white blood cells, including cancerous cells. It is not typically used in the management of tumor lysis syndrome. Reference: .",

      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: C) 1 and 4 Explanation: Lung and breast cancers have a high risk of metastasizing into the brain. Hence, prophylactic cranial radiation is administered in these cases. Lung cancer: Prophylactic cranial radiation is commonly used in patients with small cell lung cancer (SCLC) who are at high risk of developing brain metastases. SCLC has a strong tendency to spread to the brain, and PCR is given to reduce the risk of metastatic disease in the brain. Breast cancer: Prophylactic cranial radiation may be considered in certain cases of breast cancer. It is typically recommended for patients with breast cancer who have a high risk of developing brain metastases, such as those with aggressive subtypes like HER2-positive or triple-negative breast cancer. Options A, B, and D are incorrect. Reference: https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9020164/ https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4477380/",
