      "explanation": "Correct Answer: D) Increased oncotic pressure Explanation: Increased oncotic pressure leads to fluid retention within the vascular system and is commonly seen in dehydration. In nephrotic syndrome , oncotic pressure is reduced (d/t loss of plasma proteins), causing edema , a key diagnostic finding. Diagnostic criteria for Nephrotic syndrome Essential findings Proteinuria of > 3.5 g/day (Option A) Urine PCR > 2g protein/g of creatinine Hypoalbuminemia - serum Albumin < 2.5 gm% (Option C) Oedema due to reduced oncotic pressure Other findings Hypercholesterolemia , Lipiduria (Option B) Urine microscopy: Oval fat bodies/Maltese cross bodies Low eGFR Hypercoagulability Causes of nephrotic syndrome: Primary causes Secondary causes Minimal change disease (Most common in children) Focal Segmental Glomerulosclerosis (Most common in adults) Membranous Glomerulosclerosis (common in older populations) IgA nephropathy (rare) Amyloidosis Diabetic nephropathy (Most common) Membranoproliferative Glomerulonephritis, like lupus nephritis HIV and COVID-19 Reference: Harrison’s Principles of Internal Medicine, 21st Edition, Page 2282, 2283, 2341 Davidson’s Principles and Practice of Medicine, 24th Edition, Page 395",

      "question": "A 65-year-old male presents with complaints of bilateral swelling of the legs and has a history of nephrotic syndrome. Which of the following pathophysiological changes is primarily responsible for the fluid retention in his condition?",
      "options": {
        "A": "Decreased production of aldosterone",
        "B": "Reduced permeability to proteins",
        "C": "Increased renal perfusion pressure",
        "D": "Glomerular sodium retention"
      },
      "correct_answer": "D",
      "explanation": "occurs because of reduced oncotic pressure from hypoalbuminemia, leading to decreased effective circulating volume and triggering compensatory mechanisms such as the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) , which promotes sodium and water retention, leading to oedema. Nephrotic Syndrome Clinical manifestations Pathophysiology Proteinuria The damage to the glomerular filtration barrier leads to increased permeability to proteins . (Option B) Odema Hypoalbuminemia Due to urinary loss of albumin being more than its synthesis by the liver. Muehrcke's lines (linear white lines in the nail bed seen in hypoalbuminemia) Hyperlipidemia Xanthoma and xanthelasma can be appreciated. Hypercoagulability This can be due to factors like: Due to the loss of anticoagulant proteins like Protein C/ Protein S/ Antithrombin III Ferritin deficiency History of factor V Leiden mutation Increased production of procoagulant factors by the liver. Infections Loss of immunoglobulins in urine causes hypogammaglobulinemia , increasing susceptibility to infections. Decreased production of aldosterone (Option A) can result from primary or secondary adrenal insufficiency, congenital adrenal hyperplasia, certain medications, or severe illness, leading to hyponatremia, hyperkalemia, volume depletion, and hypotension. In nephrotic syndrome , aldosterone production is increased as a compensatory response to hypoalbuminemia and low effective blood volume, leading to oedema. Increased renal perfusion pressure (Option C) occurs due to elevated blood flow pressure to the kidneys, often seen in conditions like hypertension and increased blood volume. In nephrotic syndrome, decreased renal perfusion may occur due to the activation of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) in response to hypoalbuminemia, leading to vasoconstriction.",

      "explanation": "function tests, and no lesions visible in light microscopy, points towards Lipoid nephrosis or minimal change disease. Minimal Change Disease (MCD) : Accounts for 70–90% of nephrotic syndrome cases in children and 10–15% in adults. Typically presents as a primary renal condition but can be associated with various factors, including Hodgkin's disease, allergies, NSAID use, lithium & infections. It commonly affects boys with age of onset between 2-6 years. Clinical Presentation: Periorbital oedema is often the first noticeable symptom, which subsequently progresses to generalised oedema , including involvement of the legs, ascites, hydrothorax, and hydrocele. Average urine protein excretion of approximately 10 g/day, resulting in severe hypoalbuminemia & acellular urinary sediment. Less common features: Hypertension (30% in children, 50% in adults) Microscopic hematuria (20% in children, 33% in adults) Atopic symptoms (40% in children, 30% in adults) Decreased renal function (25–40%) Histological Findings: Light Microscopy: No glomerular lesions are visible Immunofluorescent microscopy: Negative for deposits, though small amounts of IgM may occasionally be detected in the mesangium. Electron Microscopy: Effacement of the foot processes of podocytes Laboratory Findings: Heavy proteinuria (3+ to 4+) & low serum albumin, often <1 g/dL. BUN and Creatinine levels: Typically normal unless hypovolemia/AKI is present. Normal C3 levels Treatment: Prednisolone: Responds well with 90% remission . Initial dose: 60 mg/m²/day (or 2 mg/kg, maximum 60 mg) for 6 weeks. Followed by 40 mg/m² (or 1.5 mg/kg, maximum 40 mg) as a single morning dose on alternate days for the next 6 weeks. Extending initial therapy beyond 12 weeks is not recommended due to the increased risk of side effects without significant benefits. Second-line Immunosuppressives: Cyclophosphamide, chlorambucil, and mycophenolate mofetil for frequent relapsers or steroid-resistant cases. Focal Segmental Glomerulosclerosis (FSGS) (Option A) typically shows focal sclerotic lesions on light microscopy. Due to impaired kidney function, it often presents with normal to elevated BUN and creatinine levels, which do not align with the patient's normal results. Membranous Nephropathy (Option C) usually occurs in older adults and is characterised by subepithelial deposits seen on electron microscopy and the thickening of the basement membrane on electron microscopy. Diabetic Nephropathy (Option D) generally occurs in older patients with a history of diabetes. It presents with specific changes in kidney function over time, and light microscopy shows nodular glomerulosclerosis , which is not present in this case.",

Spot PCR > 0.2 mg/mg following a period of remission. Frequent Relapses: (After stoppage of treatment) Two or more relapses within the first six months Three or more relapses in any 12 months Steroid Dependence: Two consecutive relapses while on alternate-day steroids or within 14 days of discontinuing steroids. Steroid Resistance: Absence of remission despite treatment with prednisolone at a dose of 2 mg/kg (60 mg/m²) per day for six weeks. Feature Steroid-Responsive Nephrotic Syndrome Steroid-Resistant Nephrotic Syndrome Definition Nephrotic syndrome that responds well to corticosteroid treatment. Nephrotic syndrome that does not improve despite adequate corticosteroid treatment (e.g., prednisolone at 2 mg/kg/day for 6 weeks). Types: Initial Steroid Resistance: Lack of response from the onset. Late Steroid Resistance: Resistance develops after initial response. Common Type Minimal Change Nephrotic Syndrome (MCNS) accounts for about 80% of cases in children. It is often associated with Focal Segmental Glomerulosclerosis (FSGS) or genetic mutations affecting podocytes. Diagnosis Diagnosed without kidney biopsy; characterised by heavy proteinuria, low serum albumin, and no significant glomerular damage. Further investigation (e.g., kidney biopsy) is required to determine the underlying cause. Management Responds to high-dose corticosteroids (e.g., prednisolone), leading to remission of proteinuria and oedema within 10-14 days. Treatment may include immunosuppressive agents, calcineurin inhibitors, or other therapies, as corticosteroids are often ineffective. Significant Steroid Toxicity: (For Steroid dependent NS) New or worsening obesity (BMI >27 kg/m², equivalent to adult BMI). Hyperglycemia. Behavioral or psychiatric disorders. Slow growth (height velocity <25th percentile and/or height <3rd percentile). Glaucoma or cataracts. Avascular necrosis. Reference: OP Ghai, Essential Pediatrics, 10th Edition, Page 500,503",

The child is vitally stable. Investigations show hematuria with normal kidney function tests and C3 levels. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?",

        "A": "Minimal change disease",
        "B": "Berger’s disease",

      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "episodes of hematuria occurring shortly after respiratory infections (such as a common cold). The presence of normal kidney function tests and C3 levels further supports this diagnosis. Berger's disease (IgA nephropathy) Pathophysiology Clinical features Incidental finding Macroscopic hematuria (recurrent) following an upper respiratory infection (URTI) Asymptomatic microscopic hematuria (persistent) If this patient develops an upper respiratory tract infection (URTI), microscopic hematuria can progress to macroscopic (gross) hematuria within 48 hours. Normal blood pressure Normal urine output Lab findings Normal values of renal function test (serum creatinine, serum urea, etc.) Normal urine output Normal serum C3 level Pathological findings Light microscopy: Mesangial proliferation. Immunofluorescent microscopy: Mesangial deposition of IgA. Management There is no optimal treatment, but the following drugs are used: ACE-i (angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors) like captopril and enalapril. Steroids (when the patient has recovered from URTI) Fish oil and tonsillectomy are suggested in studies. Minimal change disease (Option A), also known as NIL lesion or lipoid nephrosis , is mostly idiopathic but can be triggered by NSAIDs or Hodgkin's lymphoma. Symptoms include puffy eyes, weight gain, pleural effusion, and ascites, but hematuria is uncommon A kidney biopsy shows IgM deposits on light microscopy and podocyte effacement on electron microscopy. Alport syndrome (Option C) is an X-linked recessive disorder resulting from the deletion of the COL4A5 gene (type IV collagen). It is characterized by hematuria, neurosensory hearing loss, and lens ocular deformities, which are absent in the given scenario. Electron microscopy of the glomerular basement membrane shows a Basket-weave appearance (irregular thickening and thinning, along with pronounced splitting and lamination of the lamina densa). Henoch-Schönlein Purpura (Option D) is an acute variant of IgA nephropathy that presents with a characteristic tetrad of symptoms: a petechial rash (buttocks and lower legs), abdominal pain (gastrointestinal vasculitis), arthralgia, visible or non-visible hematuria, with or without proteinuria (renal disease) . Renal biopsy reveals mesangial IgA deposition. Though it shares IgA deposition with Berger’s disease, the clinical presentation here points to Berger's.",
