      },
      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: A) 1g/kg per day Explanation: The patient likely has Hepatorenal Syndrome (HRS), a complication of advanced liver disease characterized by renal dysfunction due to splanchnic vasodilation and reduced renal perfusion. HRS is diagnosed based on clinical features, including worsening renal function, low urine sodium (<10 mEq/L), and exclusion of other causes of acute kidney injury (e.g., hypovolemia, nephrotoxicity). The recommended dosage of albumin infusion in HRS is 1 g/kg per day, up to a maximum of 100 g/day, to expand intravascular volume and improve renal perfusion. This is used in combination with vasoconstrictors like terlipressin or norepinephrine to reverse the underlying renal vasoconstriction. Higher doses (e.g., 2-5 g/kg/day) are avoided due to risks such as pulmonary edema. Treatment of Hepatorenal syndrome: Discontinue diuretics Albumin infusion- 1 g/kg per day Vasoconstrictors-Terlipressin, Low-dose norepinephrine Midodrine (an α -agonist), along with octreotide and intravenous albumin The best therapy for HRS is liver transplantation; recovery of renal function is typical in this setting Reference: Harrison’s Principles of Internal Medicine, 21st edition, Page 2632",

Hepatopulmonary Syndrome (HPS): It is defined as reduced arterial oxygen saturation due to dilated pulmonary vasculature in the presence of advanced liver disease or portal hypertension. Clinical Features Characterised by the triad of: Liver disease Intrapulmonary vascular dilatation Arterial hypoxemia PaO2 less than 80 mm Hg while breathing in room air. Platypnoea : Worsening of dyspnea when moving from a supine to an upright position. Orthodeoxia : Decrease in PaO2 of more than 5% or more than 4 mm Hg when moving from supine to upright. Portal hypertension Diffuse telangiectasia/Spider naevi Cyanosis Fatigue and clubbing Complications Refractory hepatopulmonary syndrome. Severe post-transplant hypoxemia. Post-transplant portopulmonary hypertension. Atelectasis (Option B): Presents with localized lung findings such as decreased breath sounds, dullness to percussion and potentially an opaque area on a chest X-ray. There is no positional dyspnea or bubble study findings associated with atelectasis. Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) (Option C): Present with a history of smoking, chronic cough, and progressive shortness of breath without the positional changes described in this patient. The bubble study result is inconsistent with COPD. Recurrent pulmonary emboli (Option D): Present with sudden-onset shortness of breath, pleuritic chest pain and sometimes hemoptysis. A bubble study would not show the delayed appearance of bubbles in the left atrium seen in HPS. Reference: www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK562169/",

      },
      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: A) Hepatopulmonary syndrome (HPS) Explanation: HPS leads to intrapulmonary shunting due to intrapulmonary vascular dilations, where blood bypasses the alveoli, resulting in poor oxygen exchange and hypoxemia. Hepatopulmonary Syndrome (HPS): It is defined as reduced arterial oxygen saturation due to dilated pulmonary vasculature in the presence of advanced liver disease or portal hypertension. Two types of HPS: Type I: Dilatation of vessels at the precapillary levels near gas exchange units of the lungs. Supplemental O2 increases PaO2 in this type of HPS. Type II: Larger vessel dilatation causes arteriovenous shunts away from the lungs' gas exchange units; supplemental O2 does not help. Etiopathogenesis HPS is most commonly associated with chronic liver disease or cirrhosis. Liver disease: Chronic liver conditions like cirrhosis trigger systemic inflammation, releasing vasodilatory substances. Nitric oxide (NO) and other vasodilators: increased NO causes intrapulmonary vascular dilatation. These dilated vessels result in abnormal oxygenation as blood bypasses the alveoli without adequate gas exchange, leading to shunt-like physiology. Imbalance in angiogenic factors: Dysregulation of vascular growth factors such as endothelin-1 and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) promotes abnormal vascular remodeling in the lungs. Ventilation-perfusion mismatch: The dilated pulmonary vessels result in a mismatch between areas of ventilation and blood flow, reducing the lung’s ability to oxygenate blood efficiently. Clinical Features Characterised by a triad of: Liver disease Intrapulmonary vascular dilatation Arterial hypoxemia PaO2 less than 80 mm Hg while breathing in room air. Platypnoea : Worsening of dyspnea when moving from a supine to an upright position. Orthodeoxia : Decrease in PaO2 of more than 5% or more than 4 mm Hg when moving from supine to upright. Portal hypertension Diffuse telangiectasia/Spider naevi Cyanosis Fatigue and clubbing Portopulmonary hypertension (Option B): Causes elevated pulmonary artery pressures but does not result in intrapulmonary shunting. The pathology is related to increased vascular resistance, not shunting. Recurrent pulmonary emboli (Option C): Causes vascular obstruction, leading to ventilation-perfusion mismatch (dead space), not intrapulmonary shunting. Pneumonia (Option D): Can cause impaired gas exchange and fluid accumulation in alveoli, but this results in ventilation-perfusion mismatch, not the intrapulmonary shunting seen in HPS.

Hepatopulmonary Syndrome (HPS): It is defined as reduced arterial oxygen saturation due to dilated pulmonary vasculature in the presence of advanced liver disease or portal hypertension. Diagnosis Arterial blood gas (ABG): Demonstrates hypoxemia with a low partial pressure of oxygen (PaO I ). Contrast-enhanced echocardiography (bubble study): Gold standard for diagnosing intrapulmonary vascular dilatations . Bubbles from injected saline will bypass the lung's capillaries and appear in the left atrium after a delay (delayed bubbles). Pulmonary angiography : Diagnose and distinguish type I and type II HPS. 99mTc-labeled macroaggregated albumin scan: Can show intrapulmonary shunting where labeled particles bypass the lungs and accumulate in systemic organs such as the brain or kidneys. Chest X-ray or CT scan Transesophageal Echocardiogram Pulmonary function tests Differential diagnoses Portopulmonary hypertension Atelectasis Recurrent pulmonary emboli Atrial septal defect Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease Pneumonia Treatment Liver transplantation : The definitive treatment , as it addresses the underlying liver disease. It has been shown to reverse pulmonary vascular abnormalities and improve oxygenation over time. Oxygen therapy: Supplemental oxygen can help manage hypoxemia but is only symptomatic relief. Transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt (TIPS): This procedure is used to reduce portal hypertension. Pulmonary arterial coil embolization No medical therapy approved for HPS. Complications Refractory hepatopulmonary syndrome. Severe post-transplant hypoxemia. Post-transplant portopulmonary hypertension. Pulmonary Angiography (Option A): Visualizes lung blood vessels; not specific for HPS. Transesophageal Echocardiogram (TEE) (Option B): Evaluates heart structures; may miss pulmonary vascular changes. Radioactive Lung Perfusion Scan (Option C): Assesses lung blood flow; does not identify intrapulmonary shunts. Reference: www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK562169/",

      "explanation": "Correct Answer: D) More than 100 grams per day Explanation: More than 100 grams/day over a decade is considered to significantly increase the risk of developing alcoholic hepatitis. Male : 40-80 grams per day develops fatty liver, and 160 grams per day for over 10 -20 years develop alcoholic hepatitis. Female : 20 grams per day Females have a higher chance of developing alcoholic liver disease. Because BMI is less, alcohol distribution per unit body weight is higher. Estrogen is also responsible for it. There is a 50 % chance that a patient with alcoholic hepatitis will deteriorate into alcoholic cirrhosis.

The National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism (NIAAA) defines alcoholic hepatitis to include the following: The onset of jaundice within 60 days of heavy alcohol consumption Serum bilirubin more than 3 mg/dL Elevated aspartate aminotransferase (AST) to 50 U/L - 400 U/L AST:ALT (alanine aminotransferase) ratio of more than 1.5 Pathophysiology: Alcohol Metabolism Ethanol is primarily metabolized in the liver by enzymes, particularly alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH) and cytochrome P450 2E1 (CYP2E1). This metabolism produces acetaldehyde, a toxic intermediate, which can cause cellular damage. Oxidative Stress The metabolism of alcohol generates reactive oxygen species (ROS) and increases oxidative stress within liver cells. This oxidative damage leads to lipid peroxidation, protein modifications, and DNA damage, contributing to hepatocyte injury and inflammation. Inflammatory Response Alcohol consumption stimulates the activation of immune cells (e.g., Kupffer cells) leading to the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines (TNF- α , IL-6). These cytokines promote inflammation and can further damage hepatocytes. Altered Lipid Metabolism Alcohol disrupts normal lipid metabolism, leading to fat accumulation in liver cells (steatosis).

Hepatic encephalopathy: Portosystemic encephalopathy is a serious complication of chronic liver disease and is broadly defined as an alteration in mental status and cognitive function occurring in the presence of liver failure. Clinical features: Mental status changes can occur rapidly in acute liver failure. Brain edema is common, with gray matter swelling linked to severe encephalopathy. Cerebral herniation is a serious complication of brain edema. Treatment for brain edema includes: Mannitol (osmotic diuretic) and Judicious use of intravenous fluids to avoid worsening edema. In cirrhosis, encephalopathy is often triggered by hypokalemia, infection, increased protein intake, or volume depletion. Symptoms include confusion, personality changes, violent behavior, or excessive sleepiness, making the patient difficult to manage or rouse. Asterixis : A flapping tremor seen in hepatic encephalopathy. Elicited by having the patient extend arms and bend wrists back (producing a “liver flap”). Other features like hyperbilirubinemia, ascites or gynaecomastia are suggestive of a liver pathology but not indicative of Hepatic encephalopathy.
