      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: A) Renal cell carcinoma Explanation: Renal cell carcinoma is a common cause of cannonball metastases due to its vascular nature and tendency for hematogenous spread. It presents as large, well-defined pulmonary nodules. Patients with RCC commonly have associated symptoms such as hematuria, flank pain, or palpable mass, but lung metastases can often be the initial presentation in advanced cases. The cannonball appearance is characteristic of metastatic RCC on chest imaging. Cannonball Metastases: Cannonball",

        "D": "Congestive Heart Failure with Pleural Effusion"
      },
      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: A) Bilateral Hydrothorax Explanation: In this case, the clinical picture and imaging findings suggest a diagnosis of bilateral hydrothorax, particularly given the patient’s background of chronic liver disease. Hepatic hydrothorax can develop in patients with advanced liver disease due to transudative fluid accumulation, often through diaphragmatic defects, into the pleural spaces. The absence of air-fluid levels, along with bilaterally homogeneous pleural fluid without signs of infection, supports the diagnosis of hydrothorax over other options. Bilateral Hydrothorax: Hepatic hydrothorax is a pleural effusion often associated with advanced liver disease. It presents as transudative pleural effusions, most commonly on the right but can be bilateral. Pathophysiologically, ascitic fluid moves across diaphragmatic defects into the pleural space due to pressure gradients. Bilateral hydrothorax, characterized by transudative fluid accumulation in the pleural space on both sides, can be caused by several other conditions. Common causes: Congestive Heart Failure (CHF) - due to increased hydrostatic pressure in the pulmonary circulation, leading to transudative pleural effusions. Nephrotic Syndrome: Severe hypoalbuminemia leads to decreased oncotic pressure, causing fluid to accumulate in various body spaces, including the pleural space. Hypothyroidism: Severe hypothyroidism can cause generalized fluid",

      },
      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: C) The condition always indicates irreversible tissue changes Explanation: The image shows typical findings of clubbing of fingers, seen in various cardiopulmonary conditions. Clubbing is not always irreversible and can be reversible in certain conditions. Clubbing of Fingers Definition • Enlargement of distal segments of fingers and toes • Proliferation of connective tissue (Option A) • Particularly on dorsal surface • Changes at base of clubbed nail Pathophysiology • Connective tissue proliferation • Exact mechanism unknown • Platelet-derived growth factors implicated (Option D) Clinical Signs Bulbous Enlargement of the Distal Phalanges Loss of the Normal Angle Between the Nail and the Nailbed (Lovibond’s Angle) Increased Sponginess of the Soft Tissue at the Base of the Nail Nail Changes: Nail flattening / nail curvature Hippocratic fingers : The tips of the fingers become enlarged, and the nails curve downward Clinical tests Schamroth’s Sign: Normal : A small diamond-shaped window should be visible between the nails when the fingers are positioned in this way. Positive Schamroth’s Sign : The window disappears, and there is no gap between the nails, indicating the loss of the normal angle at the nail bed. Associated Conditions • Cyanotic congenital heart disease • Infective endocarditis • Bronchiectasis • Cystic Fibrosis (Option B) • Lung cancer • Tuberculosis • Inflammatory bowel disease Key Features • Can be hereditary or acquired • May be reversible in certain circumstances • Associated with hypertrophic osteoarthropathy • Can cause pain and arthritis-like changes Reference: Harrison’s Principles of Internal Medicine, 21st Edition, Volume I, Page. 275",

The trachea and heart are displaced toward the left indicating a mediastinal shift. The presence of mediastinal shift with hypotension is a medical emergency requiring immediate intervention. The positive pleural pressure and mediastinal shift in tension pneumothorax can lead to cardiovascular collapse if not treated promptly. Tension Pneumothorax Clinical features • Severe respiratory distress • Hypotension • Tachycardia (>134 bpm) • Tracheal deviation • JVD • Cyanosis Investigations • Clinical diagnosis • Don't wait for imaging • Post-procedure CXR Management • Immediate: Needle decompression • Definitive: Tube thoracostomy • Follow-up: Pleurodesis consideration CT Head for identifying possible cerebral injury (Option A): Although CT head is to be done according to the protocol, the clinically obvious tension",

      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: B) Stop transfusion and administer diuretics Explanation: This case presents classic symptoms of Transfusion-Associated Circulatory Overload (TACO) : TACO is a common and underrecognized transfusion adverse reaction Clinical features include dyspnea, hypertension, bilateral crackles Management explicitly requires stopping the transfusion and administration of O2 and diuretics Risk factors include pre existing fluid overload and cardiac dysfunction Transfusion-Associated Circulatory Overload (TACO) Definition Common and underrecognized transfusion adverse reaction Incidence 1-10% per RBC transfusion Risk Factors • Preexisting fluid overload • Cardiac dysfunction • Large volume of RBCs • Excessive rate of transfusion Clinical Features • Dyspnea • Hypertension • Bilateral crackles • Elevated brain natriuretic peptide Prevention in High-Risk Patients • Slow transfusion rate (RBCC over 3-4 h) • Close monitoring Management • Stop transfusion • Administer O2 • Give diuretics TRALI: Transfusion-related acute lung injury (TRALI) is a serious complication that can occur during or within 6 hours after receiving a blood transfusion (or up to 72 hours in delayed cases). It's characterized by acute, noncardiogenic pulmonary edema with hypoxia, making it the leading cause of transfusion-related deaths reported to the FDA. The condition typically presents with symptoms like fever, hypotension, tachycardia, and difficulty breathing, along with bilateral infiltrates visible on chest X-rays. TRALI occurs when antibodies in donor blood react with the recipient's blood cells, or when stored blood products accumulate inflammatory mediators, leading to damage in the pulmonary blood vessels and fluid leakage into the lungs. Continue transfusion but at a slower rate (Option A): Continuing transfusion even at a slower rate would worsen fluid overload Administer acetaminophen and continue transfusion (Option C): Acetaminophen would not address the underlying fluid overload Stop transfusion and start steroids (Option D): Steroids are not indicated in the management of TACO according to the provided information Reference: Harrison’s Principles of Internal Medicine, 21st Edition, Volume I, Page. 895",

      "explanation": "Correct Answer: C) Pulmonary infarction due to pulmonary embolism Explanation: The wedge-shaped opacity pointing toward the hilum is characteristic of Hampton's Hump , a classic radiologic finding associated with pulmonary infarction due to pulmonary embolism (PE). The sudden onset of pleuritic chest pain and the patient's history of DVT make PE the most likely diagnosis. Hampton's Hump is a radiologic sign seen in cases of pulmonary embolism (PE) and is indicative of a pulmonary infarction. Appearance : Seen on chest X-rays as a pleural-based, wedge-shaped opacity . The apex of the wedge points toward the hilum or occluding vessel. Timing : Typically not visible within the first 24 hours after the embolus lodges in the pulmonary artery. Appears later as parenchymal infarction develops, and may take 3–5 weeks or longer to resolve . Resolution and Complications : A residual band-like opacity due to scarring or pleural thickening may persist. The infarcted area can sometimes become secondarily infected , leading to cavitation or abscess. This may also occur due to septic emboli. Differential : Hampton’s Hump can also result from edema or hemorrhage rather than infarction. Typically found in lower lobes and may appear 12 hours to several days after the thromboembolic event, with a faster",
