AFB smear is often negative in pleural effusions and diagnosis may rely on adenosine deaminase (ADA) levels or pleural biopsy. Pleural TB Pleural Effusion Characteristics Isolated Pleural Effusion: Recent primary TB infection. Hypersensitivity to mycobacterial antigens. Can occur due to contiguous parenchymal spread in postprimary TB. Asymptomatic: Small effusion, resolves spontaneously. Symptomatic: Larger effusion causes fever, pleuritic chest pain, and dyspnea. Physical Exam Findings Dullness to percussion. Absence of breath sounds. CXR Findings Reveals pleural effusion. Parenchymal lesions in up to one-third of cases. Thoracentesis Findings Fluid Color : Straw-colored (sometimes hemorrhagic). Exudate: Protein concentration ~4-6 g/dL (>50% of serum). Glucose: Normal to low. pH: ~7.3 (occasionally <7.2). WBC: 500–6000/ µ L (lymphocyte predominance in later stages). Mesothelial Cells: Rare or absent. AFB (Acid-Fast Bacilli) Rarely seen on direct smear. Cultures may be negative, especially in early cases. Additional Diagnostic Tests Adenosine Deaminase : Useful for screening; low values exclude TB. IFN- γ : Measured directly or through T-cell stimulation. Pleural Biopsy: Preferred for diagnosis ; reveals granulomas or positive culture in up to 80% of cases. Xpert MTB/RIF Assay : 75% positivity in pleural biopsy; fluid testing not recommended. Treatment Chemotherapy: Rapid response, spontaneous resolution possible. Glucocorticoids: May reduce fever/chest pain but have unproven benefits. Parapneumonic effusion (Option A): Usually associated with bacterial pneumonia and more commonly presents with neutrophil predominance in the pleural fluid. Malignant pleural effusion (Option C): Would show atypical cells in the pleural fluid and often be hemorrhagic, with high LDH levels. Congestive heart failure (Option D): Typically causes a transudative pleural effusion with low protein levels, not lymphocyte predominance.

      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: B) Genitourinary tuberculosis Explanation: Genitourinary tuberculosis is a condition commonly affecting the fallopian tubes and endometrium, leading to infertility, pelvic pain, and urinary symptoms like dysuria and hematuria. The negative urine cultures and presence of pyuria are suggestive of TB, especially in an individual with a history of pelvic symptoms. Genitourinary Tuberculosis (TB) Pathophysiology Can affect any part of the genitourinary tract. Symptoms often appear late, after destructive kidney lesions have developed. Symptoms Urinary Symptoms : Frequency, dysuria, nocturia, hematuria Other Symptoms : Abdominal or flank pain Asymptomatic: Some patients are asymptomatic, leading to delayed diagnosis and irreversible organ damage. Genital TB (Women) It affects fallopian tubes and endometrium , causing infertility, pelvic pain, and menstrual abnormalities. Diagnosis via biopsy or culture from dilation and curettage. Genital TB (Men) It affects epididymis (a tender mass that may drain via the fistula); orchitis and prostatitis may also occur. In 50% of cases, urinary tract involvement is also present. Diagnosis CXR : Up to 75% show abnormalities suggesting past or concurrent pulmonary TB. Urinalysis : Abnormal in 90% of cases (pyuria, hematuria). Culture-negative pyuria in acidic urine is a key clue. Imaging : IV pyelography, abdominal CT, or MRI show deformities, obstructions, calcifications, and ureteral strictures. Urine Culture : Three-morning urine specimens confirm diagnosis in nearly 90% of cases . Complications Ureteral Strictures : Can cause hydronephrosis, renal damage, and renal failure. Treatment Responds well to chemotherapy. Urinary tract infection (Option A): Typically presents with positive cultures, and symptoms are usually more acute and can include urgency and burning. Pelvic inflammatory disease (PID) (Option C): Could cause similar symptoms but usually presents with acute pain, fever, and more prominent systemic signs. Culture would often show infection.

      "explanation": "Correct Answer: B) Primary pulmonary tuberculosis Explanation: Primary pulmonary tuberculosis occurs shortly after initial TB infection, especially in children. The presence of fever, pleuritic chest pain, calcified Ghon focus, hilar lymphadenopathy and erythema nodosum points towards primary TB. Primary TB - Pathophysiology Primary pulmonary TB occurs shortly after initial TB infection; common in children in high-transmission areas. May be asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic. Common Symptoms Fever Occasionally, pleuritic chest pain Skin manifestations: erythema nodosum (legs) or phlyctenular conjunctivitis Pathology Primary Lesion (Ghon Focus) : The initial lesion typically forms in the middle or lower lung zones, often peripheral with transient hilar/paratracheal lymphadenopathy. Ghon Complex: Combination of Ghon focus, pleural reaction, and regional lymphadenopathy; may heal and calcify over time. The calcified lesion is called Ranke complex. Disease Progression In Immunocompromised Individuals (e.g., young children, HIV+ patients): Lesion enlargement with potential necrosis and cavitation (progressive primary TB). Pleural Effusion: Bacilli may penetrate pleural space from subpleural focus; seen in up to two-thirds of severe cases. Lymphatic Spread Lymphadenopathy : Enlarged hilar/paratracheal lymph nodes can compress bronchi, causing: Bronchial obstruction and lung collapse Partial obstruction with wheezing Segmental/lobar hyperinflation (ball-valve effect) . Lymph node rupture may lead to necrotic pneumonia and cavitation in distal airways. Complications Bronchiectasis : May develop in areas affected by progressive caseating pneumonia. Dissemination : Hematogenous spread can lead to: Miliary Disease: Multiple granulomatous lesions in organs. TB Meningitis : Particularly in young children and immunocompromised individuals. Acute bacterial pneumonia (Option A): Often presents with fever and productive cough, but calcified lesions and lymphadenopathy are uncommon. Cystic fibrosis (Option C): Usually presents with chronic respiratory symptoms, poor growth, and family history, but it doesn’t typically cause lymphadenopathy or a Ghon focus. Viral lower respiratory tract infection (Option D): Can present with wheezing and fever but does not cause calcified lesions or hilar lymphadenopathy.

Correct Answer: C) Secretion of TNF- α and IFN- γ by activated T cells, resulting in macrophage activation and the subsequent formation of caseous necrosis. Explanation : Postprimary tuberculosis (TB) , also known as reactivation TB, occurs when M. tuberculosis that has remained dormant after the primary infection reactivates, often due to a compromised immune system or other risk factors. Pathophysiology of Postprimary TB: Reactivation of Latent Infection After the primary infection, TB bacilli can become encapsulated within granulomas formed in the lungs or lymph nodes. These granulomas help contain the infection but do not eliminate it. The bacteria can remain dormant for years in this latent state. Reactivation occurs when the host's immune response is weakened , which can be due to factors such as immunosuppressive conditions (HIV, diabetes, malnutrition) Immune Response Upon reactivation, a cell-mediated immune response is triggered, primarily involving T lymphocytes (CD4+ and CD8+ T cells). Activated T cells release cytokines like interferon-gamma (IFN- γ ), which activates macrophages, enhancing their ability to kill intracellular bacteria. Despite this response, the immune system may fail to contain the bacteria, leading to continued replication. Granuloma Formation and Caseous Necrosis The reactivated bacilli can cause caseous necrosis within the granulomas, characterised by the destruction of lung tissue and the formation of a necrotic centre. This necrosis leads to the formation of cavitary lesions, especially in the lung apices, where oxygen levels are higher, favouring the growth of M. tuberculosis. Cavitation Occurs in the apices of the lungs or apical segments of the lower lobes. As the necrotic tissue liquefies, cavities develop in the lung parenchyma. These cavities provide a nutrient-rich environment for the bacteria, allowing them to proliferate. The presence of cavitary lesions and ongoing inflammation can lead to the destruction of lung tissue and impairment of lung function. In some cases, the infection can spread hematogenously, leading to extrapulmonary TB, affecting other organs like the kidneys, bones, and central nervous system. Activation of B cells leads to antibody production, which facilitates phagocytosis of M. tuberculosis. (Option A) : While B cells and antibodies play a role in immune defence, the primary mechanism for tissue destruction and cavitation in postprimary TB is not through antibody-mediated phagocytosis. Release of IL-4 and IL-10 from T-helper cells, promoting a Th2 response that leads to fibrosis and walling off of the infection. (Option B): IL-4 and IL-10 promote a Th2 response, which is generally associated with allergic responses and may lead to fibrosis but does not facilitate the formation of cavitary lesions in postprimary TB. Induction of a robust innate immune response mediated by neutrophils, resulting in rapid clearance of bacteria and prevention of necrosis.

Focus/Lesion Location Ghon Focus Location : Lower part of the upper lobe or upper part of the lower lobe of the lung, typically subpleural. The initial area of infection in primary TB appears as a granulomatous lesion. When combined with lymph node involvement, it forms the Ghon complex. Simon Focus Location : Apices of the lungs. A small nodular lesion forms in the lung apices due to the reactivation of dormant TB bacteria. Assmann Focus Location : Infraclavicular It is prone to cavitation, leading to potential bacterial spread and transmission. Weigert Focus Location : In the lung tissue near blood vessels. Occurs due to hematogenous (blood-borne) spread of TB, creating lesions along the vascular pathways. Weigart focus is often seen in miliary or disseminated TB. Rich Focus Location : Brain or meninges. A site of TB infection within the central nervous system, which can rupture, leading to tuberculous meningitis. Ranke Complex Location : Typically in the lung apices with calcified lymph nodes in the hilum. The Ranke complex consists of a calcified Ghon focus and involved lymph nodes, indicating old, inactive TB. Puhl lesion Location : Most commonly found in the supraclavicular region, which is significant as this location can indicate the spread of TB from the lungs or other primary sites of infection.

      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: B) To diagnose latent TB infection Explanation : The primary use of IGRAs is to identify individuals with latent tuberculosis infection (LTBI) . Tuberculin Skin Test (TST) and Interferon-gamma Release Assays (IGRAs) are specific for latent tuberculosis infection. Diagnostic Tests: Tuberculin Skin Test (TST) Interferon-gamma Release Assays (IGRAs) Chest X-ray Sputum Tests Biopsy of suspicious lesions or lymph nodes for histopathological examination. Interferon-gamma Release Assays (IGRAs): Principle: T-lymphocytes release interferon-gamma when exposed to M. tuberculosis antigens. Mycobacterium TB antigen CFP10 is used in the test, and it reacts with the patient's T cells to release γ interferons. IGRAs like QuantiFERON-TB Gold In-Tube offer several advantages for LTBI diagnosis: Higher specificity in BCG-vaccinated individuals (negative in BCG-vaccinated individuals) No cross-reactivity with most non-tuberculous mycobacteria Requires only a single patient visit Results are available within 24-48 hours No boosting effect with repeated testing T spot TB Test is also approved in IGRA. To confirm active TB disease (Option A): IGRAs cannot confirm active TB; they only indicate if there has been an immune response to TB proteins. To monitor treatment response (Option C): IGRAs are not used to assess treatment efficacy, as a positive test can remain for years even after successful treatment of LTBI. To assess the severity of lung disease (Option D): IGRAs do not provide information about lung function or the extent of the disease.

      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: B) Isothermal amplification of DNA at a constant temperature Explanation: LAMP test amplifies DNA at a constant temperature without the need for thermal cycling. TB lab investigations: Investigations Purpose Advantages Limitations Sputum smear Initial screening for pulmonary TB. Samples are stained using the Ziehl-Neelsen method or Auramine-O stain to visualize acid-fast bacilli (AFB) under a microscope. Quick and inexpensive. Can provide results within a few hours. Low sensitivity, especially in cases of extrapulmonary TB or in patients with HIV. Cannot differentiate between Mycobacterium tuberculosis and non-tuberculous mycobacteria (NTM). Culture Methods Confirm the diagnosis of TB and assess drug susceptibility. Solid Media: Sputum is inoculated onto solid culture media like Löwenstein-Jensen or Middlebrook agar. Liquid Media: Automated systems like BACTEC or MGIT are used to detect growth faster. The gold standard for TB diagnosis. Allows for drug susceptibility testing. Time-consuming; results can take weeks. Requires specialized laboratory facilities. Xpert MTB/RIF Detects Mycobacterium tuberculosis and rifampicin resistance. Method : A cartridge-based system that performs nucleic acid amplification (NAAT). Sputum or other specimens are processed directly in the cartridge. Rapid results (within 2 hours). High sensitivity and specificity. Simultaneously detects rifampicin resistance. More expensive than smear microscopy. Does not provide full drug susceptibility testing. LAMP (Loop-Mediated Isothermal Amplification) Detects DNA of Mycobacterium tuberculosis. Method : Amplifies DNA at a constant temperature without the need for thermal cycling. Sputum or other specimens are used. Rapid results (within 1-2 hours). High specificity and sensitivity. Can be performed at the point of care. Used for patients with HIV with CD4+ counts of less than 100 cells/ µ L irrespective of signs and symptoms of TB. Less widely available than PCR-based tests. Cannot detect drug resistance directly. TrueNat Point-of-care test for TB detection. Method : Uses a micro-PCR technology to amplify DNA. Results are available within 60 minutes. Portable and easy to use in peripheral health facilities. Provides results quickly, facilitating immediate treatment decisions. Line Probe Assay (LPA) Detects TB and drug resistance (rifampicin and isoniazid). Method : Sputum samples are processed, and DNA is extracted. Amplified DNA is hybridized to specific probes on a membrane strip. Rapid results (within 1-2 days). Can detect multiple mutations associated with drug resistance. Requires a laboratory setup and trained personnel. Not suitable for all strains of TB. RFLP IS6110 restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) analysis is widely used for molecular epidemiological studies of tuberculosis. Restriction enzymes Nru I, EcoN I, Pst I, and Pvu II were used to analyze IS6110 fingerprints in Mycobacterium tuberculosis strains H37Rv (virulent) and H37Ra (avirulent).

      "question": "A 34-year-old man with advanced HIV infection (CD4 count of 50 cells/mm³) is diagnosed with pulmonary tuberculosis (TB) and started on anti-tuberculosis treatment. Two weeks later, he initiated antiretroviral therapy (ART). After 3 weeks on ART, he returns to the clinic complaining of worsening cough, fever and night sweats. Physical examination reveals enlarged cervical lymph nodes and increased lung crackles on auscultation. His viral load has dropped significantly, but his CD4 count remains low.

      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: B) Immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome (IRIS) Explanation : This patient likely has TB-associated immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome ( IRIS ), a paradoxical worsening of TB symptoms after starting HAART. HIV and TB Co-infection: Increased Risk: People with HIV are 18-26 times more likely to develop active TB than those without HIV. HIV weakens the immune system, reducing CD4 T-cell counts, which are essential for controlling TB infection. This allows TB to progress from latent to active disease. The underlying mechanism of IRIS is due to an imbalance between anti-inflammatory cytokines and pro-inflammatory cytokines that occurs rapidly after the recovery of immune function in HIV patients initiated on HAART. Screening and Diagnosis: Testing for Both Conditions: Patients with TB should be tested for HIV, and vice versa, given the high co-infection rate. Diagnostic Challenges: TB symptoms can overlap with other opportunistic infections in HIV patients. Tests like sputum culture, X-rays, and newer rapid molecular tests (GeneXpert) help in diagnosing TB in HIV-positive patients. Treatment of Co-Infection: Anti-TB Therapy: This involves the standard TB drug regimen, usually with a 6-month course. Treatment may extend for cases of drug-resistant TB. Instead of Rifampicin, Rifabutin is preferred in patients receiving protease inhibitors due to its property of being a less potent inducer of CYP3A4. Antiretroviral Therapy (ART): Initiating ART is crucial for improving immune function. ART is typically started 2-8 weeks after beginning TB treatment to prevent immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome (IRIS), depending on CD4 count and clinical status. Drug Interactions: TB drugs, like rifampicin, can interact with ART drugs, requiring careful selection of the ART regimen to minimize side effects and maintain effectiveness. IRIS in TB-HIV Co-Infection: State of hyperinflammatory response that usually occurs in the first six months of treatment of HIV/AIDS patients. It is a potential complication of the use of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART). Symptoms : Common symptoms include fever, worsening cough, and enlarged lymph nodes. It often presents 2-12 weeks after starting ART. Management : Mild IRIS cases are managed symptomatically with paracetamol and NSAID. For more severe cases , corticosteroids may be used to control inflammation while continuing both TB and ART medications. Drug-resistant TB (Option A): While drug-resistant TB can cause persistent or worsening symptoms, it usually presents with poor clinical response despite appropriate treatment over several weeks. In this case, the patient initially improved and symptoms worsened after ART initiation , making resistance less likely . Also, there's no mention of treatment",

      "question": "A 41-year-old man with a history of night sweats, fever, and weight loss presents with anal fistulae. Physical examination and imaging suggest an abscess near the rectum. Which diagnostic step should be prioritized to investigate a possible cause?",
      "options": {

        "D": "Culture and sensitivity of fistula discharge"
      },
      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "Correct answer: A) Evaluation for rectal tuberculosis Explanation: The presence of anal fistulae, particularly in a patient with systemic symptoms such as night sweats, fever, and weight loss, points to rectal tuberculosis (TB) . Anal fistulae can be a manifestation of gastrointestinal TB. Evaluating for rectal TB is important, as this condition may mimic other gastrointestinal diseases but requires specific anti-tubercular treatment for effective management. Gastrointestinal Tuberculosis Mechanisms of Infection Swallowing of sputum with direct seeding. Hematogenous spread. Ingestion of contaminated bovine milk (common in developing areas). Common sites of infection Terminal ileum and cecum. Symptoms Abdominal: Pain (similar to appendicitis), swelling, obstruction, hematochezia, palpable abdominal mass. Systemic: Fever, weight loss, anorexia, night sweats. Complications: Ulcerations and fistulae (mimicking Crohn’s disease); anal fistula suggests rectal TB. Diagnosis Surgery is required to obtain histologic and culture specimens intraoperatively. Differential Diagnosis: Difficult to distinguish from Crohn’s disease. Screening for Crohn’s disease (Option B): While Crohn's disease can cause anal fistulae and presents with chronic abdominal pain and weight loss, this patient's night sweats and fever are more indicative of an infectious cause like TB. Crohn's disease also does not present with systemic symptoms making TB a more likely diagnosis. Colonoscopy with biopsy for malignancy (Option C): Although malignancy could present with weight loss and other systemic symptoms, it is less likely to cause anal fistulae. Culture and sensitivity of fistula discharge (Option D): While culturing the fistula discharge may identify pathogens, the yield for diagnosing TB from such samples is low, as mycobacteria may not be easily detected in superficial cultures. A targeted evaluation for TB would be more beneficial in this case. Reference: Harrison’s Principles of Internal Medicine, 21st Edition, Page 1366",
