      "correct_answer": "D",
      "explanation": "for blood storage. Correct answer: D) ACD and CPD/CPDA preservatives can be used interchangeably in any volume for blood storage. Explanation: While both ACD (Acid-Citrate-Dextrose) and CPD/CPDA (Citrate-Phosphate-Dextrose and Citrate-Phosphate-Dextrose with Adenine) are blood preservatives, they are not interchangeable in terms of volume or usage for blood storage due to the specific components and the volumes required for proper blood preservation ACD (Acid-Citrate-Dextrose) : ACD contains citrate to chelate calcium ions and prevent clotting (Option A ruled out) , dextrose as a source of nutrition (Option C ruled out) , and acid to adjust the pH. ACD typically requires 15 mL per 100 mL of blood for effective preservation. CPD/CPDA (Citrate-Phosphate-Dextrose and Citrate-Phosphate-Dextrose with Adenine) : CPD contains citrate, phosphate (to maintain the pH), and dextrose (for nutrition), while CPDA includes adenine in addition to the components of CPD. Adenine helps preserve ATP levels in red blood cells during storage, improving cell viability. (Option B ruled out) CPD/CPDA typically requires 14 mL per 100 mL of blood for effective preservation.

        "D": "All are correct"
      },
      "correct_answer": "D",
      "explanation": "Correct answer: D) All are correct Explanation: Hyperkalemia can occur after massive blood transfusion, especially with stored blood, where potassium is released from lysed red blood cells. This is a concern, particularly with older blood that has been stored for longer periods Hypocalcemia is a well-known complication of massive blood transfusion due to citrate in stored blood. Citrate binds to calcium, reducing ionized calcium levels and leading to symptoms like tetany, muscle cramps, or seizures. Hyperphosphatemia can develop after massive transfusion due to the release of phosphate from red blood cells. This can result in precipitation of calcium phosphate, especially in patients with renal insufficiency, exacerbating hypocalcemia . While hyperkalemia is the more common issue, hypokalemia can occur in some cases due to dilutional effects or metabolic shifts . One potential cause of hypokalemia after massive transfusion is the alkalosis (increase in pH) that occurs, especially if citrate (from stored blood) leads to metabolic alkalosis , which can cause potassium to shift into the cells. Other electrolyte abnormalities: Hypomagnesemia occurs due to citrate binding magnesium, causing muscle weakness, tremors, seizures, and arrhythmias. Hyponatremia may result from dilution when large volumes of low-sodium fluids (like normal saline) are transfused. Hypernatremia can develop if blood products contain higher sodium concentrations than the recipient’s blood. Hypochloremia can occur with metabolic alkalosis (due to citrate toxicity or bicarbonate use). Reference: Harrison’s Principles of Internal Medicine, 21st Edition, Page 895",

        "D": "All bacterial spores and viruses are removed by the pathogen-mitigating processes"
      },
      "correct_answer": "D",
      "explanation": "processes Correct Answer: D) All bacterial spores and viruses are removed by the pathogen-mitigating processes Explanation: The scenario depicts an infectious adverse reaction of transfusion in which the pathogen mitigation process , though used efficiently, still would not effectively kill bacterial spores and non-enveloped viruses . Infectious Adverse Reactions in Blood Transfusion Causes: Careful donor selection: Screening for healthy donors free from high-risk behaviours, medical conditions, or exposure to infectious pathogens like Hep B, Hep C, HIV, Malaria,and Syphilis. Bacterial contamination: Contamination of blood components (BCs) can lead to infections during (endotoxins) or shortly after transfusion. Specific bacteria, such as Yersinia , can grow at refrigeration temperatures (4°C), posing additional risks. Bacterial spores are resistant to the process of pathogen reduction in platelets and plasma. Viral Infections: New infectious risks have emerged, such as West Nile virus and hepatitis E , highlighting the need for ongoing vigilance. Non-enveloped viruses like hepatitis A virus, parvovirus B29, and hepatitis E virus are resistant to the pathogen reduction processes of the platelets and plasma. Clinical features A rapid onset of fever and chills during or soon after transfusion. Severe cases can progress to septic shock and disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), potentially resulting in death. Endotoxins from contaminated blood components may contribute to severe reactions in recipients. Precautions Testing procedures: Blood donations are tested for infectious agents using methods like nucleic acid amplification , which helps detect pathogens more effectively. (Option A) Pathogen reduction techniques: Processes are in place to minimize the risk of infection in platelets and plasma, with ongoing developments for red blood cells (RBCs). Limitations exist for these processes, particularly regarding bacterial spores and non-enveloped viruses (e.g., HAV, parvovirus B19, HEV). Post-donation monitoring: Donor reports of symptoms (e.g., fever within 24 hours of donation) enable the quarantine of affected blood products. (Option C) Surveillance and mitigation: Active surveillance programs are essential for identifying new infectious risks and implementing additional testing and deferral measures.

      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: C) Acute hemolytic transfusion reaction Explanation: Clinical features of fever, chills, chest pain, and dark urine that developed within 24 hours post-transfusion , along with examination findings of hypotension and tachycardia and lab tests showing hemoglobinemia, elevated LDH, and a positive direct antiglobulin test, point towards a diagnosis of Acute hemolytic transfusion reaction. Hemolytic Transfusion Adverse Reactions (Immune-Mediated) Occurs when the recipient preformed antibodies (Abs) lyse transfused donor red blood cells (RBCs). Occur during or 24 hours after transfusion. Type 2 hypersensitivity reaction Anti-A or anti-B Abs are responsible for the most severe, often fatal reactions. Common Causes: Failure in product or patient identification. Erroneous blood grouping. Unidentified anti-RBC alloimmunization in the recipient. Acute Hemolytic Reaction (Option C): Symptoms: Hypotension, tachypnea, tachycardia Fever (1-2°C increase) Chills Chest/back pain In severe cases, disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), acute renal failure, shock, and death. Diagnosis: Based on persistent/worsening anemia Depleted plasma haptoglobin levels Hemoglobinemia, hemoglobinuria Elevated lactate dehydrogenase, and unconjugated bilirubin Positive direct and indirect antiglobulin tests (Coombs tests). Management: Mainly supportive Stop transfusion Vigorous hydration with isotonic saline and diuretics to maintain urine output. Forced alkaline diuresis if necessary. Correction of electrolyte abnormalities, and pressor support. For DIC and severe bleeding: Platelets, plasma, cryoprecipitate, or fibrinogen may be required. Delayed Hemolytic Reactions (Option B): Symptoms: Icterus, persisting or worsening anemia due to anamnestic response in previously sensitized patients with low antibody levels. Timing: Alloantibodies are detectable 1–2 weeks after transfusion. Anaphylactic transfusion reaction (Option A) occur within minutes of transfusion and are characterized by symptoms like bronchospasm and respiratory distress, whereas this patient developed fever, chills, chest pain, and dark urine within 24 hours, along with a positive direct antiglobulin test, indicates an acute hemolytic transfusion reaction. Transfusion-associated circulatory overload (Option D) (TACO) typically occurs within 6 hours of transfusion and presents with tachycardia, tachypnea, and hypoxia, along with evidence of pulmonary edema. In contrast, this patient developed fever, chills, chest pain, and dark urine within 24 hours, along with a positive direct antiglobulin test, which are more indicative of an acute hemolytic transfusion reaction.

      "explanation": "Correct Answer: B) Anaphylactic Transfusion Reaction Explanation: Clinical features of acute bronchospasm, hypotension, and severe respiratory distress, along with no prior transfusion history, point towards the diagnosis of an Anaphylactic transfusion reaction. Allergic transfusion reactions: Cause: Related to plasma proteins in transfused components. Mild Allergic Transfusion Reactions (majority) Symptoms: Rash, pruritus, urticaria, localized edema. Management: Temporarily stop the transfusion. Administer antihistamine drugs. Prevention: Premedication with antihistamines may be used, although no consensus exists. Washed cellular components can be considered for extremely sensitized patients. Severe Allergic (Anaphylactic) Transfusion Reactions (rare) (Option B) Anaphylactic reactions can occur within minutes of starting a transfusion, even after just a few milliliters of blood transfusion. Symptoms: Bronchospasm, respiratory distress, hypotension, nausea, vomiting, shock. Management: Stop the transfusion immediately and maintain vascular access. Administer adrenaline (0.3-0.5 mg subcutaneously). Additional treatments may include steroids, antihistamines, and bronchodilators.

      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Correct answer: C) Citrate toxicity Explanation: Citrate is an anticoagulant used in blood products. In massive transfusions, excess citrate binds to calcium, leading to hypocalcemia, which can manifest as muscle cramps, laryngospasm, and other signs of calcium deficiency. Massive Blood Transfusion Massive Blood Transfusion refers to the rapid replacement of a large volume of blood, typically defined as the transfusion of more than 10 units of packed red blood cells (PRBCs) within 24 hours, or more than 4 units in an hour. This situation often arises in life-threatening conditions like severe trauma, major surgery, or obstetric hemorrhage. Complications of Massive Blood Transfusion Complication Cause Effect Prevention/ Management Hypothermia Transfusion of cold blood (stored at 4°C). Body temperature drops, leading to impaired clotting mechanisms (coagulopathy), worsening bleeding. Warm blood products before transfusion Use external warming methods (e.g., warming blankets). Coagulopathy Dilution of clotting factors and platelets due to transfusion; consumption of clotting factors by ongoing hemorrhage. Impaired blood clotting, prolonged bleeding time, increased risk of continued bleeding. Administer fresh frozen plasma (FFP), platelets, cryoprecipitate. For massive BT, blood products should be administered in 1:1:1 ratio. Monitor clotting factors (e.g., PT, aPTT). Citrate Toxicity Large volumes of transfused blood contain citrate , which binds to calcium. Hypocalcemia , leading to muscle cramps, seizures, and cardiac arrhythmias. Administer calcium gluconate or calcium chloride prophylactically. Hyperkalemia Potassium leaks from stored red blood cells into plasma during storage. Elevated potassium levels",

Blood component preparation began in 1960, utilizing a specialized refrigerated centrifuge to separate various blood products from a single unit of whole blood. The two types of centrifugation are as follows: Single-step centrifugation: Used for preparing Packed Red Blood Cells (PRBC) and Fresh Frozen Plasma (FFP). Involves heavy spin centrifugation. Two-step centrifugation: Required for producing Platelet Concentrates (PLTC), PRBC concentrates , and FFP . Methods for platelet concentrate preparation: Platelet-Rich Plasma (PRP) Method: Simple and can be performed manually. More cost-effective but yields lower amounts of platelets and plasma. Buffy Coat (BC) method: More efficient in terms of yield. More complex to perform manually and thus often necessitates automation. Steps for preparation: Collect Whole Blood: Begin with a single unit of whole blood. Centrifugation: Single-step: done for PRBC and FFP. Two-step: done for PLTC, PRBC concentrates, and FFP.

      "explanation": "adds galactose. Correct Answer: B) A-transferase adds N-acetylgalactosamine to the H antigen, while B-transferase adds galactose. Explanation: A-transferase adds N-acetylgalactosamine to the H antigen, while B-transferase adds galactose describes the functions of the transferase enzymes that modify the H antigen to form A and B antigens, respectively. Carbohydrate Blood Groups ABO:Encoded by chromosome 9 Inheritance: Co-dominant ABO Antigens : 2 main antigens, A & B, exist. 4 phenotypes arise: A, B, AB, and O. Molecular Structure : A and B antigens are carbohydrate structures on red cell membrane glycoproteins and glycolipids, mainly carried by glycoproteins like GLUT1 and band 3. The precursor structure, H antigen, is modified by A- and B-transferases (encoded by ABO genes) to form A and B antigens. (Option C) Group O red cells have unmodified H antigens due to the lack of active enzyme from the O allele.

(Option B) O allele is non-functional due to a frameshift mutation. (Option A) Phenotype Antigen Present Transferase Enzyme Sugar Added H Antigen Status Genotype A A A-transferase N-acetylgalactosamine Present (modified) AA or AO B B B-transferase Galactose Present (modified) BB or BO AB A & B Both A & B -transferase N-acetylgalactosamine & Galactose Present (modified) AB O None inactive enzyme H antigen remains unmodified Present (unmodified) OO The rare Bombay phenotype lacks both H antigen and its derivatives due to mutations in both FUT1 and FUT2, resulting in anti-H antibodies . (Option D) Protein Blood Groups Rh System: The Rh system (formerly \"Rhesus\") is specific to humans, meaning immunization occurs only through allogeneic exposure (e.g., transfusion or pregnancy). Abs produced in response to Rh antigens are termed \"immune\" or \"irregular,\" as their production is variable. The Rh system has 56 antigens, with the most immunogenic being RhD (RH1) . RhD antigen presence indicates Rh-positive status, while its absence denotes Rh-negative. The RhD gene (RH D) and RhCE gene (RH CE) located on chromosome 1 determine eight main haplotypes (e.g., DCe, Dce). Identifying weak or partial RhD expression is crucial, especially in women of childbearing age and heavily transfused patients. Kell System: Kell includes the K antigen (KEL1) , whose absence leads to the McLeod phenotype , associated with acanthocytosis, muscle dystrophy, and shortened RBC survival. Duffy System: The Duffy system has five antigens, with Fya (FY1) and Fyb (FY2) being routinely tested. The Fy(a–b–) phenotype , common in individuals of African ancestry, is associated with resistance to Plasmodium vivax malaria .

      "question": "A 55-year-old female who recently underwent a solid organ transplant is about to receive a red blood cell transfusion. She is at high risk for transfusion-transmitted cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection. Which of the following measures can reduce her risk of CMV transmission during transfusion?",

        "A": "Blood irradiation",
        "B": "Use of a diversion pouch",
        "C": "Use of leukoreduction filter",
        "D": "Using washed red blood cells"
      },
      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: C) Use of leukoreduction filter Explanation: Leukoreduction filters are used to remove more than 99.9% of white blood cells from blood products . Since CMV resides in WBCs , using leukoreduction filters greatly reduces the risk of transfusion-transmitted CMV infection. This is particularly important for immunocompromised patients, such as organ transplant recipients. Leukocyte filter Leukoreduction is a process in which the WBCs are intentionally reduced by almost 99.99% in RBC concentrates. Decrease the WBCs to < 1-5×106. Filtration Mechanisms : Mechanical Entrapment (Sieving) : Based on pore size and cell deformability. Physical-Chemical Entrapment (Adhesion) : Involves adherence of cells to the filter surface. Uses of Leukocyte Removal Filters It reduces complications associated with transfused white blood cells that are contained in units of red blood cells and platelets. These complications include: Nonhemolytic Febrile Transfusion Reactions (NHFTRs) . Alloimmunization and platelet transfusion refractoriness. Transfusion-transmitted infections, such as cytomegalovirus (CMV). (Option C) Immunomodulation risks from transfusions. Diversion pouch (Option B ruled out) A diversion pouch is attached to a primary collection bag, diverting the first 10–30 mL of blood into the pouch. This prevents the initial blood flow from entering the primary bag, which can reduce the risk of bacterial contamination . Blood irradiation (Option A) prevents transfusion-associated graft-versus-host disease (TA-GVHD) by inactivating donor lymphocytes. However, it does not reduce the WBC count or prevent CMV transmission. Washed red blood cells (Option D) remove plasma proteins to prevent allergic reactions but do not significantly reduce WBCs and thus do not lower the risk of CMV transmission.",

      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: B) Apheresis Explanation: Apheresis is a technique that involves drawing blood from a patient or donor and separating it into its individual components using centrifugation or filtration. The desired component is collected, while the remaining components are returned to the individual. Components separated by apheresis along with their indications: Component Indications for Separation Plasma Plasmapheresis, treatment of autoimmune diseases (e.g., myasthenia gravis, lupus) and excess plasma proteins (e.g., hyperviscosity syndrome). Platelets Collection for transfusion, especially in patients with low platelet counts (e.g., leukemia, chemotherapy). Red Blood Cells Erythrocytapheresis for conditions like sickle cell disease and management of polycythemia vera. White Blood Cells Leukapheresis to reduce high white blood cell counts in leukemias or lymphoproliferative disorders. Procedure of Apheresis Blood Collection: Blood is drawn from a vein, typically in the arm. Separation: The blood is processed using a centrifuge or filtration system that separates it into its components based on density. Collection of Desired Component: The targeted blood component (plasma, platelets, RBCs, or WBCs) is collected, while the remaining components are returned to the individual. Return of Blood: The residual blood is infused back into the donor or patient. Benefits of Apheresis in Separation Targeted Therapy: Apheresis allows for the selective removal of harmful components. Efficient Donation: It enables the collection of specific blood products from donors. Hemodialysis (Option A) is a medical procedure that uses a machine to filter waste products and excess fluids from the blood. It is typically performed in patients with kidney failure. Blood is drawn from the body, filtered through a dialyzer (artificial kidney) , and then returned to the body. Hemodialysis is better for smaller solutes Hemofiltration (Option C) is a renal replacement therapy used primarily in critically ill patients, which removes waste and excess fluid from the blood. It utilizes a filtration process where plasma is filtered through a semipermeable membrane , allowing for the removal of small solutes and excess water while retaining larger molecules like proteins. Hemofiltration is better for larger solutes Therapeutic phlebotomy (Option D) is a procedure that involves drawing blood from patients to treat conditions like hemochromatosis or polycythemia vera, helping to reduce excess iron or red blood cell mass.",

      "correct_answer": "D",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: D) Irradiation Explanation: Irradiation is an important step for preventing GVHD by inactivating T lymphocytes in the donor's blood products. Failure to properly irradiate the granulocyte concentrate can lead to the survival of donor T cells, which can attack the recipient’s tissues, resulting in GVHD. Steps for Producing Granulocyte Concentrates from Whole Blood 1 Collection of Whole Blood or Apheresis (Option C ruled out) Granulocyte concentrates can be obtained either through whole blood collection or by apheresis. The apheresis method selectively extracts granulocytes, enhancing the yield and quality of the concentrate. 2 High-Speed Centrifugation (Hard Spin) The collected blood is subjected to high-speed centrifugation, which separates it into three distinct layers based on density: Packed Red Blood Cells (RBCs): This forms the bottom layer. Plasma: The top layer contains proteins, electrolytes, and waste products. Buffy Coat: The middle layer, rich in leukocytes, including granulocytes, is collected for further processing. 3 Isolation of the Buffy Coat The buffy coat is carefully extracted, which contains the concentrated leukocyte population, primarily granulocytes. 4 Buffy Coat High-Speed Centrifugation The isolated buffy coat undergoes a second round of high-speed centrifugation. This step further concentrates the granulocytes and separates them from other leukocytes. 5 Irradiation (Mandatory) (Option D) The granulocyte concentrate is then irradiated at a dose of 25-35 Gy. This step is essential to prevent transfusion-associated graft-versus-host disease (TA-GVHD). 6 Leukoreduction (Option A ruled out) Finally, leukoreduction is performed on the granulocyte concentrate to minimize the risk of immunological complications in the recipient. 7 Pathogen Reduction (Optional) (Option B ruled out) Storage and Handling Volume: Each unit typically contains 650 mL with approximately 2 x 10¹ I granulocytes. Storage Temperature: At room temperature but can also be refrigerated in certain cases. Shelf Life: These concentrates must be used within 24 hours of collection.

This layer is rich in white blood cells and platelets and serves as the primary source for platelet extraction. Steps for Producing Platelets from Whole Blood 1 Collection of Whole Blood Blood is drawn into sterile bags with anticoagulants to prevent clotting. Each unit contains 450-500 mL. 2 High-Speed Centrifugation (Hard Spin) Separates the blood into three distinct layers based on density: Packed Red Blood Cells (RBCs) (bottom layer): Contains the majority of erythrocytes. Plasma (top layer): Contains proteins, electrolytes, and waste products. Buffy Coat (middle layer): Contains platelets and white blood cells (WBCs). 3 Isolation of the Buffy Coat The buffy coat, rich in platelets and leukocytes, is carefully extracted to minimize contamination from the packed RBCs and plasma. 4 Slow-Speed Centrifugation The buffy coat undergoes slow-speed centrifugation to separate the platelets from other blood components. This step allows for the concentration of platelets, which can be pooled from 4 to 6 ABO-identical units or obtained through apheresis. 5 Suspension in Additive Solution The platelets are diluted in an additive solution to reduce the chances of post-transfusion fever, a common reaction associated with platelet transfusions. 6 Leukoreduction/Deleucocytation The leukocyte count is reduced to less than 1-5 x 10 I leukocytes/unit.

Explanation: The image shows a leukocyte-reduction blood filter system, typically used during blood transfusions to remove white blood cells (leukocytes) from blood products. This process is called leukoreduction. Leukoreduction enhances safety and reduces certain risks; it does not extend the shelf life of red blood cells, which is primarily determined by storage conditions and preservatives. Steps for Production of Red Blood Cell Concentrates (RBCC) from Whole Blood. 1 Whole Blood Collection Blood is drawn into sterile bags with anticoagulants to prevent clotting. Each unit contains 450-500 mL. (First 20-30 ml is discarded due to skin flora contamination) 2 Slow Speed Centrifugation (Soft Spin) Separates Red Blood Cell Concentrate (RBCC) at the bottom and Platelet-Rich Plasma (PRP) at the top, with the buffy coat (white blood cells) in between. 3 RBCC Processing and Additive Solutions After removing plasma and buffy coat, additive solutions like SAGM (Saline, Adenine, Glucose, Mannitol) or CPD are added to preserve cell viability and extend shelf life. 4 Leukoreduction/ Deleucocytation Achieved by filtering RBCC to remove >99.9% of white blood cells. Purpose: Reduces febrile non-hemolytic transfusion reactions (FNHTR). Minimizes the presence of intracellular pathogens [eg. cytomegalovirus (CMV)] Minimizes alloimmunization.
