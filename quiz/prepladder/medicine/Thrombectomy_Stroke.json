On further questioning, the patient admits to experiencing neck pain following a minor car accident a week ago. Physical examination confirms the presence of ptosis, miosis, and anhidrosis on the right side of the face. What is the most likely site of the lesion?",

      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "ptosis (drooping eyelid), miosis (constricted pupil), and anhidrosis (lack of sweating), all on the ipsilateral side. Horner's syndrome results from disruption of the sympathetic nerves supplying the eye and face. In this case, the combination of Horner's syndrome and recent neck trauma raises suspicion for internal carotid artery dissection, a known cause of Horner’s syndrome. The sympathetic fibers that innervate the eye travel along the internal carotid artery as part of the third-order neurons . A dissection of this artery can compromise these fibers, leading to the classic triad of ptosis, miosis, and anhidrosis. This is an important cause of Horner’s syndrome, especially after neck trauma. Carotid dissection also carries a risk of ischemic stroke due to thromboembolism. Horner’s Syndrome: Horner’s syndrome occurs due to interruption of the sympathetic pathway to the eye and face. The sympathetic supply to the eye is a three-neuron pathway : First-order neurons originate in the hypothalamus and descend through the brainstem to the spinal cord (C8-T2) region, also known as the ciliospinal center of Budge . Second-order neurons leave the spinal cord and ascend through the sympathetic chain over the apex of the lung, synapsing in the superior cervical ganglion . Third-order neurons travel along the internal carotid artery into the cavernous sinus , then along the ophthalmic division of the trigeminal nerve to reach the eye and face. Clinical Features of Horner's Syndrome: Ptosis : Drooping of the upper eyelid due to loss of sympathetic innervation to the superior tarsal muscle (also called Muller's muscle). Miosis : Constricted pupil due to unopposed action of the parasympathetic system following loss of sympathetic input to the dilator pupillae muscle . Anhidrosis : Lack of sweating on the affected side of the face due to involvement of sympathetic fibers supplying the sweat glands. Causes of Horner's Syndrome: First-order neuron lesions : Brainstem stroke, multiple sclerosis, spinal cord trauma (e.g., syringomyelia). Second-order neuron lesions : Pancoast tumors, thoracic aortic aneurysm, neck surgery. Third-order neuron lesions : Internal carotid artery dissection, cavernous sinus lesions. Management: In cases of suspected internal carotid artery dissection, imaging such as CT angiography or MR angiography is crucial to",

      "question": "A 58-year-old man presents to the clinic with the complaints of right sided weakness and difficulty speaking. His speech is slow, effortful, and fragmented with short sentences, but his comprehension is not affected. Which of the following type of aphasia is this patient suffering from?",
      "options": {
        "A": "Wernicke’s Aphasia",
        "B": "Broca’s Aphasia",
        "C": "Global Aphasia",
        "D": "Conduction Aphasia"
      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "specifically the Broca’s area (located in the posterior part of the frontal lobe). Patients with Broca’s aphasia have non-fluent speech, often with grammatical errors and difficulty forming full sentences, but their comprehension remains intact. They may also have right-sided weakness, as seen in this patient. Wernicke’s Aphasia (Option A) : Wernicke’s aphasia is characterized by fluent speech with poor comprehension and the use of nonsensical or irrelevant words (word salad). People with Wernicke’s aphasia can speak in long sentences, but their speech lacks meaning. The patient in the case has non-fluent speech , which points more toward Broca's aphasia, not Wernicke's. Global Aphasia (Option C) : Global aphasia involves severe impairments in both speech production and comprehension. Patients with global aphasia have difficulty with almost all aspects of language, including speaking, understanding, reading, and writing. This patient’s preserved comprehension rules out global aphasia. Conduction Aphasia (Option D) : Conduction aphasia is caused by damage to the arcuate fasciculus , the pathway that connects Broca's area and Wernicke’s area. People with conduction aphasia have fluent speech but have difficulty with repetition and making corrections to their speech, often with phonemic paraphasias (incorrect sounds or words). The patient described here does not show the characteristics of fluent speech or frequent paraphasias, so this diagnosis is less likely.",

      "correct_answer": "D",
      "explanation": "ability to perform vertical eye movements and blinking—is characteristic of Locked-in Syndrome. This condition results from damage in the brainstem, particularly the anterior pons, affecting motor control while sparing cognitive functions. Locked-in Syndrome (Pseudocoma) Locked-in syndrome (LIS) is a condition characterized by quadriplegia, bulbar palsy, and sensory loss due to damage in the brain stem, often the anterior pons. Causes include vascular lesions, tumors, infections, trauma, and demyelinating disorders. Lesions affect the ventral pons or caudal ventral midbrain while sparing the cerebrum. Damage to cranial nerve nuclei leads to loss of voluntary muscle control. Corticobulbar and corticospinal tracts are affected, impacting motor and sensory functions. The reticular activating system, responsible for wakefulness, remains intact. Clinical Features: Functions lost: Paralysis of limbs and torso. Bulbar palsy leading to anarthria and dysphagia. Difficulty with breathing, potential apnea, hyperpnea, ataxia. Dizziness, Vertigo Functions retained: Consciousness, orientation and language comprehension. Hearing and ability to perform vertical eye movements and blinking. Parinaud Syndrome (Option A) results from lesions in the midbrain, often affecting the vertical gaze. Patients may have difficulties with eye movement but typically retain motor function and consciousness, which does not match the clinical presentation in the scenario. Claude Syndrome (Option B) is caused by lesions in the midbrain that affect the oculomotor nerve and the red nucleus, leading to oculomotor palsy and ataxia. Patients may have motor and sensory deficits, but unlike Locked-in Syndrome, they do not retain the ability to perform vertical eye movements. Raymond Syndrome (Option C) results from lesions affecting the corticospinal and abducens pathways in the pons, leading to contralateral hemiparesis and ipsilateral abducens nerve palsy. While it shares some similarities, it does not present with the preserved consciousness and eye movement found in Locked-in Syndrome.

On examination, the patient has a right-sided ptosis, a dilated pupil that does not react to light, and an outward deviation of the right eye. The left side of his body shows weakness with hyperreflexia. MRI reveals an ischemic lesion in the midbrain. Which of the following structures is most likely involved in this patient’s condition?",

      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "involves a lesion in the midbrain affecting both the oculomotor nerve and the corticospinal tract in the crus cerebri. Arteries involved are paramedian branches of the posterior cerebral artery. Structures Involved in a Midbrain Stroke: Oculomotor Nerve Nucleus (Cranial Nerve III): Function: Controls most of the eye movements, pupillary constriction, and eyelid elevation (levator palpebrae superioris). Clinical Findings: Damage to the oculomotor nerve leads to ptosis , a dilated pupil (mydriasis) , and an eye that is deviated outward and downward (due to unopposed action of the lateral rectus and superior oblique muscles). Trochlear Nerve (Cranial Nerve IV): Function: Innervates the superior oblique muscle, which helps in depression and intorsion of the eye. Clinical Findings: A lesion of the trochlear nerve causes vertical diplopia - difficulty looking downwards and inwards, noticed while reading or descending stairs. Trochlear nerve damage would not explain the ptosis or mydriasis seen in this patient (Option A ruled out) . Substantia Nigra: Function: Part of the basal ganglia, it plays a crucial role in motor control and coordination, with loss of dopamine-producing neurons here leading to Parkinsonism . Clinical Findings: Midbrain strokes affecting the substantia nigra can result in motor deficits, tremors, and bradykinesia, similar to Parkinson's disease. The patient's main issues involve cranial nerve III and motor weakness, not Parkinsonism features (Option C ruled out). Crus Cerebri (Corticospinal Tracts): Function: Contains descending fibers of the corticospinal and corticobulbar tracts, responsible for voluntary motor control. Clinical Findings: Damage here leads to contralateral hemiparesis due to involvement of the corticospinal tract. In Weber syndrome, the lesion commonly affects both the oculomotor nerve and the crus cerebri. While the crus cerebri is affected in this case, it alone does not account for the cranial nerve signs (Option D ruled out).

TACS presents with a triad of features: Hemiplegia/hemiparesis affects at least two areas of the body (face, arm, or leg) on one side. Cortical dysfunction , which includes either global aphasia (when the dominant hemisphere is affected) or neglect (when the non-dominant hemisphere is involved). Homonymous hemianopia , indicating a visual field deficit. This patient has all three cardinal features of TACS, making it the most likely diagnosis. Lacunar Stroke (Option A) : Involves small perforating arteries and affects the subcortical structures such as the basal ganglia, internal capsule, thalamus, and pons. Lacunar strokes do not involve cortical symptoms like aphasia or visual field defects, as seen in this patient. They present with \"pure motor,\" \"pure sensory,\" or ataxic hemiparesis syndromes, but cortical signs are absent, ruling this out. Posterior Circulation Stroke (Option B) : Strokes in the posterior circulation involve the vertebrobasilar system, including the brainstem, cerebellum, and occipital lobes. Symptoms typically include dizziness, ataxia, visual disturbances like cortical blindness, and cranial nerve abnormalities, which do not match this patient’s presentation of hemiplegia, aphasia, and neglect. Partial Anterior Circulation Stroke (PACS) (Option C) : PACS affects only part of the anterior circulation, usually just the MCA or ACA territory. PACS is differentiated from TACS by the fact that not all three key features (hemiplegia, cortical dysfunction, and visual field defect) are present. In PACS, one or two features of TACS may be seen, but the full triad is absent.

Thus, the MCA is the vessel most likely involved in this patient’s presentation. Blood Supply of the Brain: The brain is primarily supplied by two systems: the anterior circulation from the internal carotid arteries and the posterior circulation from the vertebral arteries . These arteries anastomose to form the Circle of Willis , providing collateral circulation between the anterior and posterior blood supplies 1. Internal Carotid Artery (ICA) Branches : Ophthalmic artery : Supplies the eye and orbital structures. Posterior communicating artery (PCoA) : Connects the internal carotid artery with the posterior cerebral artery. Anterior cerebral artery (ACA) : Supplies medial portions of the frontal and parietal lobes. Middle cerebral artery (MCA) : The largest branch, supplies the lateral aspect of the brain. Internal carotid artery occlusion can cause ischemia in MCA or ACA territory or a watershed (border zone) infarct between these areas. 2. Anterior Cerebral Artery (ACA) Supply : Medial portions of the frontal and parietal lobes, including the superior portion of the motor and sensory cortices (leg area). ACA Stroke : (Option A) Contralateral weakness and sensory loss, primarily affecting the lower limb (leg > arm). Frontal lobe symptoms, including abulia (lack of initiative) and personality changes. Urinary incontinence due to damage to the medial frontal lobes. 3. Middle Cerebral Artery (MCA) Supply : Lateral surface of the frontal, parietal, and temporal lobes; basal ganglia; and internal capsule. MCA Stroke : (Option B) Contralateral hemiparesis and hemisensory loss (face and arm > leg). Aphasia if the dominant hemisphere (usually left) is affected. Hemineglect if the non-dominant hemisphere is involved. Homonymous hemianopia due to optic radiation involvement. 4. Posterior Cerebral Artery (PCA) Supply : Occipital lobe (visual cortex), inferior temporal lobe, thalamus, and parts of the midbrain. PCA Stroke : (Option C) Contralateral homonymous hemianopia (loss of the same side of the visual field in both eyes). Thalamic pain syndrome (Dejerine-Roussy syndrome) if the thalamus is involved, leading to contralateral sensory loss followed by chronic pain. Memory disturbances if the temporal lobe is affected. 5. Vertebral Arteries Branches : Posterior inferior cerebellar artery (PICA) : Supplies the cerebellum and lateral medulla. PICA Stroke : Wallenberg syndrome (lateral medullary syndrome): Causes ipsilateral facial numbness, contralateral body numbness, ataxia, vertigo, and dysphagia. 6. Basilar Artery Supply : Pons, midbrain, occipital lobes, and cerebellum. Branches : Anterior inferior cerebellar artery (AICA) : Supplies the cerebellum and parts of the brainstem. Superior cerebellar artery (SCA) : Supplies the superior cerebellum and parts of the midbrain. Posterior cerebral arteries (PCA) : Terminal branches that supply the occipital lobe. Basilar Artery Stroke : (Option D) Locked-in syndrome : Quadriplegia with preserved consciousness and vertical eye movements due to damage to the pons.

The visual field loss is congruent , meaning it affects the same portion of the visual field in both eyes. It may involve the central field ( splitting the macula ) or peripheral fields. Homonymous hemiachromatopsia : Loss of color vision in the same half of the visual field. Irritative lesions can lead to elementary visual hallucinations , such as flashes of light or geometric shapes. Effects of Right Occipital Lobe Disease: Visual illusions and hallucinations : More extensive lesions in the right occipital lobe may produce complex visual disturbances , such as visual illusions (distorted perception of objects) and hallucinations (seeing things that are not present). Loss of topographic memory and visual orientation : Patients may have difficulty recognizing familiar places or navigating through space, affecting their ability to understand spatial relationships. Effects of Left Occipital Lobe Disease: In addition to the visual field deficits described above, Lesion of the splenium of the corpus callosum : This can cause alexia without agraphia , where the patient loses the ability to read while maintaining the ability to write.

The frontal lobe is crucial for language, executive function, and emotional regulation, which aligns with the impairments observed in this case. Frontal Lobe Stroke: Obstruction of the anterior cerebral artery (ACA). Motor impairments: Hemiparesis/Hemiplegia: Weakness or paralysis on the opposite side of the body. Ataxia: Uncoordinated movement, affecting limbs, gait, speech, and swallowing. Dysphagia: Difficulty swallowing. Speech and language: Aphasia: Especially common in left frontal lobe stroke (Broca’s area), affecting speech and language formation. Cognitive deficits: Executive dysfunction: Impaired decision-making, planning, attention, and multitasking. Vascular dementia: Memory loss, poor impulse control, and behavioral changes. Behavior and personality changes: Emotional dysregulation: Irritability, impulsiveness, apathy, anxiety, or decreased motivation. Incontinence: Loss of bladder and bowel control. Impaired spatial reasoning: Difficulty with spatial awareness and navigation. Each hemisphere affects the opposite side of the body, with left frontal lobe strokes affecting speech more, and right frontal lobe strokes often leading to spatial reasoning impairments. Right Temporal Lobe Stroke (Option A) affects auditory processing and memory, leading to difficulties with sound recognition and visual memory, but it would not typically cause significant speech impairments or changes in behavior. Occipital Lobe Stroke (Option C) primarily results in visual disturbances, such as blurred vision or visual field loss, and would not account for the cognitive and speech issues present in this scenario. Left Parietal Lobe Stroke (Option D) can cause issues with language and spatial awareness but does not typically lead to the emotional and executive function deficits observed in this patient.

      },
      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "difficulty speaking. The CT scan ruling out hemorrhagic stroke further confirms the diagnosis. Administering intravenous Alteplase immediately is appropriate as the patient presents with signs of an ischemic stroke and is within the treatment window for intravenous thrombolysis (within 3-4.5 hours). Since the CT scan has ruled out hemorrhagic stroke, administering rtPA is crucial for improving outcomes by restoring blood flow to the affected area of the brain. Management of Ischemic Stroke Optimize Cerebral Perfusion: Goal: Preserve the ischemic penumbra. Blood Pressure (BP) Management: Reduce BP if >220/120 mmHg, or >185/110 mmHg if thrombolytic therapy is anticipated. Avoid routine BP lowering to prevent worsening outcomes. Malignant hypertension or myocardial ischemia: Consider lowering heart rate using β 1-adrenergic blockers (e.g., esmolol ). Prevention of Complications: Deep Venous Thrombosis (DVT): Subcutaneous heparin (unfractionated or low-molecular-weight) Pneumatic compression stockings Cerebral Edema: Peak edema: 2nd-3rd day post-stroke. Mannitol and water restriction can raise serum osmolarity. Avoid hypovolemia Hemicraniectomy Neuroprotection: Fever is detrimental: Treat with antipyretics and surface cooling. Serum glucose management: Keep levels <10.0 mmol/L (180 mg/dL) and >3.3 mmol/L (60 mg/dL). Intravenous Thrombolysis: IV rtPA (Alteplase) within 3 hours (0.9 mg/kg, max 90 mg, 10% bolus, rest over 60 minutes) is effective despite a 6.4% risk of intracranial hemorrhage. Extended window: 3-4.5 hours (limited efficacy) per ECASS III trial. Tenecteplase (0.25 mg/kg IV bolus) is also used, with simpler administration. Endovascular Revascularization: For large-vessel occlusions (MCA, ICA, basilar artery), mechanical thrombectomy improves outcomes, especially within 6 hours. Antithrombotic Treatment: Aspirin (160-300 mg daily) within 48 hours reduces stroke recurrence. Anticoagulation (heparin, oral anticoagulants) is not recommended for atherothrombotic strokes but may benefit dural sinus thrombosis . Cerebellar Stroke Management: Watch for signs of increased intracranial pressure (ICP) , which can cause brainstem compression. Suboccipital decompression is recommended before brainstem compression in deteriorating patients. Rehabilitation and Stroke Units: Early physical, occupational, and speech therapy . Use of pneumatic compression stockings to prevent DVT. Constrained movement therapy for hemiparesis, even years post-stroke.

This regimen reduces 90-day stroke risk from 11.7% to 8.2% without significant increase in major hemorrhage Initial loading dose of clopidogrel 300 mg followed by 75 mg daily with aspirin 75 mg is the recommended protocol ABCD2 score helps stratify TIA patients' risk of stroke: Age ≥ 60 years (1 point) BP ≥ 140/90 (1 point) Clinical features (weakness=2, speech disturbance=1) Duration ( ≥ 60 min=2, 10-59 min=1) Diabetes (1 point) High ABCD2 score ( ≥ 4) indicates high risk of early recurrent stroke: Early aggressive antiplatelet therapy with DAPT (first 21-90 days) followed by monotherapy is the current standard of care for high-risk TIA patients Choice of long-term antiplatelet agent (after initial DAPT period) depends on individual patient factors and can include aspirin, clopidogrel, or aspirin-dipyridamole combination. Aspirin alone (Option A): While aspirin is effective for long-term secondary prevention, using it alone in the acute phase after high-risk TIA (ABCD2 score ≥ 4) provides suboptimal protection Warfarin (Option C): Anticoagulation with warfarin is not indicated for non-cardioembolic TIAs . It is primarily used for cardioembolic stroke prevention in conditions like atrial fibrillation Has higher bleeding risk compared to antiplatelet therapy. Ticagrelor alone (Option D): While ticagrelor has been studied in stroke prevention, it's not recommended as monotherapy. Recent studies show benefit only when combined with aspirin, similar to clopidogrel-aspirin combination.

      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "outside the 4.5-hour window for intravenous thrombolysis, but within the 6-hour window for mechanical thrombectomy . CT angiography has confirmed a large vessel occlusion (right MCA), which is an indication for mechanical thrombectomy. Mechanical Thrombectomy: 1. Need for Mechanical Thrombus Removal: Some clots, especially platelet-rich ones, are resistant to thrombolysis due to high concentrations of PAI-1. Mechanical thrombectomy can quickly restore cerebral blood flow in cases where thrombolysis is contraindicated, has failed, or the patient presents outside the thrombolysis window. 2. Goal of Mechanical Clot Manipulation: To rapidly restore cerebral blood flow in the affected arterial territory. To achieve functional recovery with reduced or no use of fibrinolytics. 3. Indications: Large vessel occlusion (e.g., internal carotid artery, M1 segment of MCA) confirmed by imaging. Within 6 hours of symptom onset for anterior circulation strokes. Can be extended up to 24 hours in selected patients with favorable imaging (e.g., good collaterals on CT or MR perfusion). Failed or contraindicated IV thrombolysis. 4. Procedure for Mechanical Thrombectomy: Vascular access via the femoral artery. A guidewire and microcatheter are advanced to the site of occlusion. A retrievable stent (often made of nitinol) is deployed to ensnare the clot. The stent with the entrapped clot is withdrawn under balloon protection to prevent distal embolization. Intravenous thrombolysis with tPA (Option A): This is incorrect because the patient is outside the 4.5-hour window for IV tPA administration. Antiplatelet therapy only (Option C): While antiplatelet therapy is part of secondary stroke prevention, it is not the most effective acute treatment for a large vessel occlusion within the time window for mechanical thrombectomy. Supportive care and observation (Option D): This is inadequate management for a patient with a large vessel occlusion who is within the time window for mechanical thrombectomy.

They supply important deep structures including the internal capsule, putamen, and caudate nucleus. The described pure motor hemiparesis is a classic lacunar syndrome resulting from occlusion of a lenticulostriate artery affecting the posterior limb of the internal capsule. Lacunar strokes result from occlusion of small penetrating arteries and typically cause distinct clinical syndromes Lacunar Strokes Lacunar Syndrome Location of Infarct Supplying Vessel Clinical Features Pure Motor Hemiparesis Posterior limb of internal capsule or basis pontis Lenticulostriate arteries or paramedian pontine arteries Face, arm, and leg weakness on one side without sensory, visual, or cognitive deficits Pure Sensory Stroke Ventral posterolateral nucleus of thalamus Thalamogeniculate arteries Hemisensory loss affecting face, arm, and leg without motor weakness Ataxic Hemiparesis Posterior limb of internal capsule or basis pontis Lenticulostriate arteries or paramedian pontine arteries Ipsilateral ataxia with contralateral pyramidal signs Dysarthria-Clumsy Hand Pons or internal capsule (genu) Penetrating branches of basilar artery or lenticulostriate arteries Dysarthria and dyspraxia of hand without significant weakness M1 segment (Option A) : This is the proximal portion of the MCA before it branches; while it gives rise to the lenticulostriate arteries, occlusion here typically causes larger, more extensive strokes involving both deep and cortical areas. M2 segment (Option B) : This is the insular segment of the MCA that supplies parts of the lateral cortex. Infarcts here often involve cortical signs like aphasia or neglect, depending on the hemisphere. M3 segment (Option D) : This segment extends over the opercular surface and supplies more superficial cortical areas. Lesions here also typically present with cortical deficits.
