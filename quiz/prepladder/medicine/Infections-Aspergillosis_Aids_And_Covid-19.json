      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: B) Tenofovir Explanation: Tenofovir (in both its formulations, tenofovir disoproxil fumarate [TDF] or tenofovir alafenamide [TAF]) is effective against both HIV and HBV. It is commonly used in combination antiretroviral therapy (ART) regimens for coinfected patients to suppress both viral infections. Nucleotide reverse transcriptase inhibitors: These are antiretroviral drugs that are effective against HBV as well as HIV; thus, they are used in combination with other antiretroviral therapies to treat HIV and HBV co-infection. Mechanism of action : It binds to viral DNA using the reverse transcriptase enzyme and, causes premature termination of the viral protein chain, and inhibits the formation of new viral particles. Treatment for HIV and HBV co-infection ART containing TDF or TAF plus Emtricitabine Or ART containing TDF or TAF plus Lamivudine Or ART plus ETV Tenofovir Disoproxil Fumarate ( TDF ), Tenofovir Alafenamide ( TAF ), Entecavir (ETV) Drugs Dose Adverse effect Tenofovir 300mg OD Nephrotoxicity, osteomalacia, Hepatitis flare-up in HBV coinfected patients who discontinue the drugs Emtricitabine 200 mg OD Hepatitis flare-up in HBV coinfected patients who discontinue the drugs Lamivudine 300 mg OD Efavirenz (Option A) is a non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor effective against HIV but not HBV. It is used in combination with other antiretroviral drugs for HIV and can cause neuropsychiatric side effects, including depression and suicidal tendencies. Abacavir (Option C) is a nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor that is effective only against HIV and has no activity towards HBV. HLAB5701 testing is necessary before using this drug as it can cause a fatal anaphylaxis reaction. Ritonavir (Option D) is a protease inhibitor that is used as a combination drug with other antiretroviral agents as antiretroviral therapy to treat HIV infection. It can be used in low doses as a pharmacokinetic booster.

      "correct_answer": "D",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: D) Tenofovir + Lamivudine + Dolutegravir Explanation: Tenofovir + Lamivudine + Dolutegravir is a recommended first-line regimen for the treatment of HIV. This combination includes three drugs from two different classes: Tenofovir and Lamivudine, which provide a backbone of nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs), and Dolutegravir, a potent integrase strand transfer inhibitor (INSTI) known for its strong efficacy. Dolutegravir-based therapy is available in fixed-dose combinations, which simplifies treatment regimens, reduces costs, and enhances adherence to therapy. This combination is widely accepted among various patient populations, including those living with HIV, individuals with HIV/TB co-infections, and adolescents, due to its effectiveness and tolerability. Antiretroviral therapy ART should include three drugs - from 2 different classes to prevent resistance and improve the efficacy of the therapy 2 NRTI + 1 NNRTI 2 NRTI + 1 PI 2 NRTI + 1 INI The only double drug therapy accepted by the FDA is Lamivudine + Dolutegravir.

Abacavir + Lamivudine + Lopinavir (Option B) is generally not used as the first-line therapy for HIV infection. Moreover, Abacavir requires HLA-B*5701 testing due to the risk of hypersensitivity reactions, which can be severe and potentially life-threatening. Tenofovir + Lamivudine + Efavirenz (Option C) was previously recommended as the first-line therapy for HIV. However, according to the 2018 recommendations, efavirenz was replaced by Dolutegravir.

Clinical stages of HIV Acute HIV infection It usually happens after 3 to 6 weeks of primary infection Patients may present with varying symptoms and can also show neurologic and dermatological involvement. Chronic HIV infection It is also called asymptomatic HIV infection or clinical latency. Patients can be asymptomatic during this stage but can still transmit the virus. If left untreated, the patient can progress to AIDS in around 10 years or even faster. AIDS This is a severe stage where life-threatening complications can occur Diagnosis is made if CD4 count is < 200/ µ L in individuals above 6 years of age with a history of HIV These people have a high viral load and can easily transmit the virus.

Explanation: HIV transmission can happen from the affected mother to the child from the first trimester of pregnancy, during delivery and breastfeeding. (Option B) Prolonged labour , advanced gestational age, STIs during pregnancy, preterm delivery, and obstetric procedures increase the risk of transmission. (Option C) ART has greatly reduced the risk of transmission in recent times, combined with cesarean delivery, which has made mother-to-child transmission of HIV extremely low.

      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: B) Itraconazole combined with low-dose corticosteroids Explanation: The most appropriate initial treatment strategy for an asthmatic patient diagnosed with ABPA is Itraconazole combined with low-dose corticosteroids that effectively target the fungal infection while managing the associated inflammation. Management of Allergic Bronchopulmonary Aspergillosis (ABPA): Primary treatment: Itraconazole (Long-term therapy is often beneficial). Low-Dose Oral Glucocorticoids: Prednisolone (7.5–10 mg daily) is generally recommended to suppress immunopathological responses and prevent progressive tissue damage. Steroid-dependent cases: Itraconazole (400 mg/day) for 16 weeks Management of exacerbations: Prednisolone (40–60 mg daily) Invasive disease: Primary treatment: Voriconazole, Isavuconazole, Posaconazole. Monitor for drug interactions, especially with rifampin and carbamazepine. Chronic pulmonary disease: Primary treatment is Voriconazole and Itraconazole . Persistent symptoms: Bronchoscopy should be performed to remove impacted mucus and facilitate prompt lung re-inflation. Surgical interventions: Necessary for certain cases, such as: Fungal sinus balls Single aspergillomas Invasive forms affecting the heart, lungs, or brain Prophylaxis: High-Risk Situations: Antifungal prophylaxis for patients at moderate or high risk, particularly post-induction therapy for acute myeloid leukaemia Common agents: Itraconazole and posaconazole (more effective in reducing infection rates). High-dose corticosteroids alone (Option A) can help manage inflammation, but they are not sufficient as a standalone treatment for ABPA. Combining corticosteroids with antifungal agents is the preferred approach to reduce fungal burden. Posaconazole (Option D) is a newer antifungal agent that is active against Aspergillus . It is typically reserved for patients who do not respond to itraconazole or those with recurrent or refractory ABPA. It is not used as the first-line treatment. Fluconazole (Option C) is ineffective against Aspergillus species as it primarily targets yeasts like Candida by inhibiting ergosterol synthesis.
