      "explanation": "β 1 is strongly associated with this condition arthritis , which is strongly associated with the presence of HLA-DR β 1. Citrullinated protein in the joints makes the protein more immunogenic, leading to autoimmunity and causing rheumatoid arthritis. Rheumatoid arthritis Epidemiology Male to female ratio - 1:3 Peaks between 25 and 55 years Remains constant between 55 and 75 Genetics Strongly associated with the HLA-DR β 1 gene (Option B) Higher concordance in monozygotic twins Triggers and suppressors Cigarette smoking and infections can trigger RA in genetically predisposed individuals by citrullination of proteins. RA may remit during pregnancy and can first appear postpartum due to immune suppression and hormonal changes. (Option D ruled out) Pathogenesis Crystal disposition in the joint spaces leads to joint inflammation (Option A) , which is seen in crystal arthropathies such as Gouts, Calcium pyrophosphate deposition disorder, basic calcium phosphate deposition arthropathy and calcium oxalate arthropathy. Joint destruction due to mechanical damage of the articular cartilage (Option C) is seen in osteoarthritis. Inflammation, along with inadequate repair, results in degenerative changes in the affected joints.",

Z-line deformity (Option C ruled out) Subluxation of the first metacarpophalangeal joint. Hyperextension of interphalangeal joint.

      "question": "A 60-year-old male with a history of working in coal mines presents with progressive shortness of breath and a chronic cough. He reports that years ago, he was diagnosed with a joint condition that caused swelling and stiffness, particularly in his hands and wrists. Laboratory testing reveals he is positive for HLA-DR4.

      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "combined with long-term occupational exposure to coal dust and the presence of rounded lung nodules on X-ray and biopsy, suggests Caplan syndrome. Caplan syndrome: It is characterised by the formation of multiple well-defined pulmonary nodules , typically located in the lung periphery, in individuals with rheumatoid arthritis who have been exposed to inorganic dust. These nodules exhibit pathological features similar to rheumatoid nodules, including central necrosis, surrounding palisading histiocytes, and a peripheral rim of lymphocytes and plasma cells. This syndrome is specifically associated with coal worker's pneumoconiosis but can also occur in other forms of pneumoconiosis. Secondary Sjögren's Syndrome (Option B) occurs in individuals with a pre-existing autoimmune disease, such as rheumatoid arthritis or lupus. It primarily involves dryness of the eyes and mouth (sicca symptoms) due to autoimmune destruction of the lacrimal and salivary glands. Felty syndrome (Option C) is a rare complication of longstanding rheumatoid arthritis, characterised by the triad of RA, splenomegaly, and neutropenia. It does not involve pulmonary opacities or occupational exposure, pulmonary nodules, or occupational lung exposure. Lofgren syndrome (Option D) is an acute presentation of sarcoidosis, marked by the triad of erythema nodosum, bilateral hilar lymphadenopathy, and arthritis (usually in the ankles). It is not related to the patient’s coal mining history or lung opacities.",

      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Correct answer: B) Anti-cyclic citrullinated peptide antibody Explanation: The clinical presentation suggests rheumatoid arthritis (RA) , characterised by morning stiffness, symmetrical joint involvement, and synovitis in the hands. The most appropriate initial investigation to support this diagnosis is the anti-cyclic citrullinated peptide (anti-CCP) antibody test, which is highly specific for rheumatoid arthritis. Causes of positive test for RF Rheumatoid arthritis Sjogren's syndrome Vasculitis such as polyarteritis nodosa Sarcoidosis Systemic lupus erythematosus Cryoglobulinemia Chronic liver disease Infections- tuberculosis, bacterial endocarditis, infectious mononucleosis, leprosy, syphilis, leishmaniasis. Malignancies Old age (5% women aged above 60) Investigations and monitoring of RA: To establish diagnosis Clinical criteria Erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) and C-reactive protein (CRP) Ultrasound or magnetic resonance imaging (Option D ruled out) ACPA and RF (both are positive in about 70% of the cases) To monitor disease damage X-rays Functional assessment To monitor disease activity and drug efficacy Pain (visual analogue scale) Early morning stiffness (minutes) Joint tenderness Joint swelling DAS28 score (Disease activity score 28) Erythrocyte sedimentation rate and C-reactive protein To monitor drug safety Urinalysis Full blood count Chest X-ray Urea and creatinine Liver function test DAS28 score: It is commonly used to evaluate disease activity, treatment response, and the need for biological therapy in rheumatoid arthritis. It calculates the number of swollen and tender joints in the upper limbs and knees, combining this with the ESR and the patient's self-assessment of their arthritis using a visual analogue scale. Anti-nuclear antibody (ANA) test (Option A) is primarily used to diagnose systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and other connective tissue diseases, not RA. Although ANA can occasionally be positive in RA, it is not a specific or reliable test for this condition. Synovial fluid analysis (Option C) helps rule out other conditions, such as infection or crystal arthropathy but is not the initial investigation for rheumatoid arthritis .

Low Disease Activity: DAS < 3.2 Moderate Disease Activity: DAS 3.2 - 5.1 High Disease Activity: DAS > 5.1 A decrease in the DAS score indicates improvement, while an increase suggests worsening disease activity. Management of Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA): Treatment Goals: Early Intervention : Start aggressive therapy to prevent joint damage and disability. Achieve low disease activity or remission. Treatment Categories: RA treatment encompasses four main categories: Nonsteroidal Anti-Inflammatory Drugs (NSAIDs): Adjunctive therapy for symptom management. Chronic use causes side effects like GI issues and renal impairment. Glucocorticoids can provide rapid control of disease activity during exacerbations. Low-dose prednisone (5–10 mg/d) may be used alongside DMARD therapy. Disease-Modifying Antirheumatic Drugs (DMARDs): Conventional DMARDs: Methotrexate: First-line DMARD is taken weekly with folic acid to mitigate side effects. Leflunomide (Option C) Sulfasalazine (Option A) Hydroxychloroquine (Option D) A commonly used conventional DMARD combination is triple therapy with: Methotrexate Sulfasalazine Hydroxychloroquine Biologic DMARDs : TNF inhibitors: Etanercept Adalimumab Tocilizumab Infliximab Certolizumab IL-1 receptor Antagonists: Anakinra Other Biologics: Abatacept (CD-80/86 inhibitor) Rituximab (CD-20 inhibitor) Tocilizumab (IL-6 receptor antagonist) Targeted synthetic DMARDs: JAK Inhibitors : Tofacitinib Baricitinib They target intracellular signalling pathways and can be used alone or with methotrexate.
