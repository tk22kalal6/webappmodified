      "correct_answer": "D",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: D) Endoscopic Ultrasound (EUS) Explanation: The clinical scenario points to insulinoma for which the main investigation of choice to confirm the diagnosis is endoscopic ultrasound . Clinical Diagnosis of Insulinoma: Presence of Whipple’s triad: Hypoglycemia (plasma glucose < 50 mg/dL). Neuroglycopenic symptoms. Relief of symptoms upon glucose administration. Biochemical diagnosis is made by the following: Plasma glucose: low. Insulin/glucose ratio: raised. C-peptide: raised. Proinsulin during a 72-hour fasting test : raised. Sulfonylurea (metabolites): absence in urine and plasma. Non-Invasive Imaging Techniques for Insulinoma Localization Invasive Diagnostic Modalities for Insulinoma Transabdominal ultrasonography CT (Option A) MRI (Option B) Somatostatin scintigraphy Endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) Considered the primary diagnostic tool . EUS-guided Fine-Needle Aspiration (FNA) Angiography with Arterial Secretagogue Venous Sampling (ASVS) Manual Palpation and Intraoperative Ultrasound (Option C) Management: Severe hypoglycemia can be challenging to manage. Medications: Diazoxide is historically used to inhibit insulin release but may cause sodium retention and nausea. It is used when preop or intraop localisation is not required. Everolimus is effective in improving glycemic control and may induce insulin resistance and have an antitumor effect. Somatostatin analogues like octreotide normalize blood glucose levels but need to be carefully used as these may worsen hypoglycemia. In high-risk patients, the following may also be done: Alcohol ablation Radiofrequency embolization Embolization Surgical treatment: Surgical resection is recommended in the absence of metastatic disease: Enucleation is done for exophytic or peripheral insulinomas. Pancreatoduodenectomy for tumours in the head of the pancreas. Distal pancreatectomy with spleen preservation for smaller tumours not involving splenic vessels.

Somatostatin receptor imaging is primarily used to detect distant metastases of somatostatinoma, not to establish the diagnosis itself. It’s a tool for assessing tumour spread rather than for initial diagnosis. Diagnosis of Somatostatinoma: Requires clinical signs/symptoms and elevated fasting plasma somatostatin levels (> 25 pmol/L, > 60 pg/mL). (Option A ruled out) If results are indeterminate, secretin or calcium stimulation tests may be used (not standardized).

        "D": "The assertion is incorrect, but the reason is correct."
      },
      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "assertion. Correct Answer: A) Both assertion and reason are correct, and the reason correctly explains the assertion. Explanation: Assertion : In DKA , the serum potassium may appear normal or elevated initially, despite a total body potassium deficiency . This is because the potassium is shifting out of cells into the extracellular space due to acidosis and insulin deficiency . Reason : I nsulin deficiency and the acidotic state in DKA cause potassium to move from the intracellular space to the extracellular space (including the bloodstream), temporarily increasing serum potassium levels. However, total body potassium is still depleted due to osmotic diuresis and vomiting , which leads to a need for potassium correction during treatment. Serum electrolytes in DKA: Potassium: Total body potassium deficiency of 3-6 mEq/kg in DKA occurs due to osmotic diuresis and vomiting. Insulin shifts potassium intracellularly, lowering serum levels, and potassium correction with IV potassium chloride (KCl) should be done. Sodium: Serum sodium is reduced due to hyperglycemia: 1.6 meq/L reduction in sodium per 100 mg/dL rise in serum glucose. Dilutional hyponatremia is common due to water driven into the intravascular space from inside cells.

      "question": "A 45-year-old male with type 1 diabetes presents with increased thirst, frequent urination, nausea, vomiting, and abdominal pain. On examination, he has dry mucous membranes, tachypnea, and a fruity odour to his breath. His blood pressure is 90/60 mmHg.

      "correct_answer": "D",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: D) Fever is always present in DKA and indicates infection. Explanation: The patient's h/o type 1 diabetes, high blood glucose, acidosis, dehydration, fruity breath, and Kussmaul breathing strongly indicate Diabetic Ketoacidosis (DKA), a serious complication triggered by insulin deficiency leading to ketone buildup and metabolic imbalance. Fever is not always present in DKA. Fever may occur if there is an infectious trigger , but it is not a constant or universal finding in all DKA patients. Therefore, the presence or absence of fever does not necessarily indicate an infection in every case of DKA.

        "D": "Increased glucose utilization prevents hyperglycemia and osmotic diuresis."
      },
      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: C) Lipolysis increases free fatty acids (FFA) in the liver, leading to ketogenesis. supporting this diagnosis include: Hyperglycemia, ketonemia, and metabolic acidosis in the context of insulin non-compliance. Deep and rapid breathing (Kussmaul respirations) is a compensatory mechanism for metabolic acidosis. Dehydration due to osmotic diuresis from hyperglycemia. In DKA, absolute or relative insulin deficiency and elevated counterregulatory hormones (e.g., glucagon, cortisol, catecholamines) result in increased lipolysis. This increases the delivery of FFAs to the liver, which are converted into ketone bodies, contributing to ketogenesis and metabolic acidosis. Pathophysiology of DKA Insulin deficiency leads to increased glucose utilization by the cells. (Option A): In insulin deficiency , glucose utilization is impaired. Insulin is necessary for glucose uptake into cells. Without it, cells cannot effectively take up glucose, leading to hyperglycemia. Elevated counterregulatory hormones increase glycogen synthesis, reducing blood glucose levels. (Option B: Counterregulatory hormones (e.g., glucagon, cortisol, epinephrine) promote glycogen breakdown (glycogenolysis) and gluconeogenesis , not glycogen synthesis . This leads to increased blood glucose levels, not a reduction. Increased glucose utilization prevents hyperglycemia and osmotic diuresis. (Option D) : Increased glucose utilization does not occur in DKA due to insulin deficiency. The lack of insulin leads to hyperglycemia and osmotic diuresis (due to the high glucose levels), which is one of the hallmark features of DKA.",

        "D": "Secretory diarrhoea shows a high osmotic gap that is not related to food intake"
      },
      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "loss Correct Answer: C) Antisecretory agents like Racecadotril and Crofelemer may help reduce fluid loss Explanation: The clinical scenario is of secretory diarrhoea associated with uncontrolled diabetes mellitus, and antisecretory agents like Racecadotril and Crofelemer help reduce fluid loss. Secretory diarrhoea: Secretory diarrhoea results from the excessive fluid secretion in the intestine. (Option A) It is driven by the active transport of ions (Na I , Cl I , HCO II , K I ) and solutes (mainly glucose) between the intestinal lumen and bloodstream. It is typically painless and is not affected by fasting with a normal faecal osmotic gap . Causes of secretory diarrhoea Overuse of laxatives Chronic alcoholism Drugs and toxins Bile acid diarrhoea Bacterial infections: Cholera, pancreatic cholera Bowel resection, disease, or fistula Partial bowel obstruction or impaction Hormone-producing tumors: Carcinoid syndrome VIPnoma Medullary cancer Thyroid Mastocytosis Gastrinoma Colorectal villous adenoma Addison’s disease Congenital electrolyte absorption defects Diabetes mellitus: Idiopathic diarrhoea with associated steatorrhea is seen in uncontrolled insulin-dependent diabetes Fluid Secretion Mechanism: It involves various ion and solute transporters, as well as the activation of signalling pathways related to cyclic nucleotides and calcium ions (Ca² I ). Key processes include: Activation of chloride (Cl I ) channels in the enterocyte's apical membrane. This activation enhances fluid secretion. Simultaneously, inhibition of sodium (Na I ) transport decreases fluid absorption. Management of secretory diarrhoea: The primary goal in managing diarrheal diseases is to promptly address dehydration . (Option B) Fluid Replacement: In developed countries, intravenous fluid replacement is commonly used in hospitals. In developing countries and non-hospital settings, oral rehydration solutions (ORS) are the standard treatment. While ORS effectively treats dehydration when administered correctly, it does not alter fluid losses, diarrheal output, or the duration of the illness. Symptomatic treatment : The treatments for diarrhoea are categorized as: Antimotility agents slow down bowel movements. Antisecretory agents reduce fluid secretion into the intestines. Antisecretory agents : Reducing intestinal fluid secretion has been a less explored approach in antidiarrheal therapies. They are: Bismuth subsalicylate Racecadotril - Prevents the degradation of endogenous opioids (enkephalins), thereby reducing hypersecretion of water and electrolytes into the intestinal lumen. Crofelemer Octreotide therapy is anticipated to enhance overall health and quality of life, ultimately reducing healthcare costs in the long term. Secretory diarrhoea shows a high osmotic gap is not related to food intake (Option D): Secretory diarrhoea typically shows a low osmotic gap (<50 mOsm/kg) because it is primarily driven by the active secretion of electrolytes and fluids into the gut, and not by the osmotic effect of undigested or unabsorbed solutes (which is characteristic of osmotic diarrhoea).

      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: B) Vibrio cholerae Explanation: A VIPoma secretes vasoactive intestinal peptide, which causes severe watery diarrhoea by mimicking the action of cholera toxin leading to difficulty in its diagnosis. A VIPoma is a type of neuroendocrine tumour that produces vasoactive intestinal peptides (VIP). They are linked to syndromes like: Verner-Morrison syndrome. Pancreatic cholera. WDHA syndrome (watery diarrhoea, hypokalemia, achlorhydria). VIP, a 28-amino-acid peptide, mimics cholera toxin effects by: Stimulating chloride secretion in the small intestine. Increasing smooth muscle contractility. Leading to severe diarrhoea. Clinical features: Patients typically present with: Severe watery diarrhoea leads to hypokalemia and metabolic acidosis. Flushing episodes. Low stomach acid ( hypochlorhydria ). Increased glycogen breakdown. Elevated calcium levels (hypercalcemia). Tumor Characteristics: Typically solitary. Often located in the pancreatic tail. Diagnosis: Elevated plasma VIP levels are common but not definitive for diagnosis, as they can occur in other conditions like: Inflammatory bowel disease. Post-surgery (small bowel resection). Radiation enteritis. Chronic laxative or diuretic use can complicate diagnosis. Treatment: Critical management includes: Fluid and electrolyte replacement to address dehydration, hypokalemia, and electrolyte losses. Long-term treatment options: Somatostatin analogues are effective in controlling diarrhoea. Surgical resection is recommended for localized tumours. Shigella dysenteriae (Option A) produces the Shiga toxin, which causes not only profuse and often bloody diarrhoea but also abdominal pain , vomiting , fever , and fatigue hence differentiated from VIPoma diarrhoea. Corynebacterium diphtheriae (Option C) produces the diphtheria toxin that causes respiratory infections and cutaneous ulcers. Bordetella pertussis (Option D) produces two toxins, the pertussis toxin and adenylate cyclase toxin, that cause tracheobronchitis.

      "explanation": "Correct Answer: C) Euglycemic Diabetic Ketoacidosis Explanation: This patient has metabolic acidosis (low pH and bicarbonate), elevated ketones, and a mildly elevated blood glucose (RBS 210 mg/dL), which is not typical of classic DKA. In the setting of SGLT2 inhibitor use , this is characteristic of euglycemic DKA , where insulin deficiency and increased glucagon lead to ketosis and acidosis, but glucose levels remain normal or only mildly elevated due to increased urinary glucose loss. The presence of beta-hydroxybutyrate and ketonuria further supports this diagnosis. Euglycemic Diabetic Ketoacidosis: Volume depletion from reduced oral intake, vomiting, and osmotic diuresis from glucosuria worsens lipolysis and ketogenesis. RBS turns out to be <250 mg/dL. SGLT2 inhibitors cause glycosuria and acidemia by ketogenesis, causing near-normal or less abnormally elevated glucose levels.

Clinical features: Commonly present with hypoglycemic symptoms , which may include: Confusion Headache Disorientation Visual disturbances Irrational behavior Coma Symptoms may be misdiagnosed as psychiatric conditions initially. Insulinoma is suspected when Whipple’s triad is observed in a patient, i.e., Symptoms of hypoglycemia (Option A) A documented low plasma glucose concentration (Option B) and Subsequent improvement of the symptoms with the use of glucose treatment (Option C) Diagnosis: The diagnosis is confirmed by: Elevated fasting insulin levels Increased proinsulin and C-peptide levels Surreptitious use of insulin or hypoglycemic agents may complicate diagnosis: This confusion is avoided by evaluating proinsulin and C-peptide levels, which should be normal with exogenous insulin use. Measurement of sulfonylurea levels can assist in differentiation.

        "A": "Insulin",
        "B": "Sulfonylureas",
        "C": "Metformin",
        "D": "Meglitinides"
      },
      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: C) Metformin Explanation: The given clinical scenario shows that the patient is diabetic, and in diabetic patients, the most common cause of hypoglycemia is antidiabetic medications like insulin and sulfonylureas . Metformin is not typically associated with hypoglycemia. It works by improving insulin sensitivity and does not increase insulin secretion, so it does not cause hypoglycemia on its own. Hypoglycemia is defined as a plasma glucose concentration of less than 70mg/dl. The symptoms of hypoglycemia, however, occur only when the plasma glucose concentration is below 55mg/dl. Clinical Manifestations of Hypoglycemia Neuroglycopenic symptoms These symptoms result from insufficient glucose supply to the central nervous system. They are: Behavioural changes Confusion Fatigue Seizures Loss of consciousness Cardiac arrhythmias Severe cases may lead to death Neurogenic (Autonomic) symptoms These are caused by the body's sympathetic response to hypoglycemia. They are of two types as follows: Adrenergic symptoms (due to norepinephrine and possibly epinephrine) Cholinergic symptoms (due to acetylcholine) Palpitations Tremors Anxiety Sweating Hunger Paresthesias These symptoms are nonspecific and require confirmation of low plasma glucose levels for attribution to hypoglycemia. Symptoms should resolve upon raising glucose levels (Whipple’s triad). Common signs: Diaphoresis (sweating) Pallor (pale skin) Increased heart rate and systolic blood pressure, though, may not be evident in individuals with frequent hypoglycemic episodes. Neurological effects: Neuroglycopenic symptoms are often noticeable. Transient focal neurological deficits can occur but permanent deficits are rare. Hypoglycemia levels Level 1 (Mild) Blood glucose is <70 mg/dL but 54 mg/dL or higher. Level 2 (Moderate) Blood glucose is <54 mg/dL. Level 3 (Severe) The individual is unable to function due to mental or physical changes caused by low blood glucose and requires assistance from another person. Causes of hypoglycemia in non-diabetic patients: Alcohol Critical illnesses End-stage liver disease Sepsis Renal failure Starvation Iatrogenic: surreptitious insulin use Cortisol deficiency Malnourishment Tumors: Insulinoma Non-islet cell tumours Hypoglycemia in diabetic patients: Drugs are the most common cause of hypoglycemia . They are: Insulin (Option A ruled out) Sulfonylureas (Option B ruled out) Meglitinides (Option D ruled out) Management of hypoglycemia: Severe hypoglycemia is treated using IV dextrose followed by a glucose infusion. For conscious patients, readily available carbohydrate sources are given. Nonpharmacological treatment involves patient education and lifestyle changes.

      "explanation": "Correct Answer: C) Non-functioning pancreatic NET Explanation: Non-functioning pancreatic NET does not secrete hormones and often remains asymptomatic until it causes anatomic symptoms like abdominal pain and weight loss. Elevated serum glucose levels suggest glucose intolerance, ruling out insulinoma due to a lack of excessive insulin. Normal levels of other pancreatic hormones further support this diagnosis. Functioning PNET Non-functioning PNET (Option C) Associated with symptoms due to hormone secretion . The most common are insulinomas . No hormone secretion.

On examination, he has dry mucous membranes, a weak pulse, and a blood pressure of 85/50 mmHg. Laboratory tests show: (Plasma glucose: 1000 mg/dL, Serum osmolality: 360 mOsm/kg, Serum sodium: 130 mEq/L, Arterial blood gas: pH 7.38, bicarbonate 18 mEq/L).

        "D": "Administer oral hypoglycemic agents"
      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: B) Administer IV 0.9% normal saline Explanation: The patient's severe hyperglycemia (1000 mg/dL) and hyperosmolality (360 mOsm/kg), along with signs of dehydration , confirm HHS ( Hyperosmolar hyperglycemic state). Initial treatment with IV 0.9% normal saline is essential to restore intravascular volume , stabilize blood pressure, and reduce neurological risks. Laboratory Abnormalities and Diagnosis of HHS Key Laboratory Features : Marked hyperglycemia (plasma glucose may exceed 55.5 mmol/L [1000 mg/dL]) Hyperosmolality (>350 mOsm/L) Prerenal azotemia Sodium Levels : Measured serum sodium may be normal or slightly low despite hyperglycemia. Corrected serum sodium usually increases (add 1.6 mEq to measured sodium for each 5.6 mmol/L [100 mg/dL] rise in serum glucose). Acidosis : In contrast to DKA, acidosis and ketonemia are typically absent or mild; small anion-gap metabolic acidosis may occur due to increased lactic acid. Ketonuria : Moderate ketonuria, if present, is usually due to starvation. Treatment of Hyperglycemic Hyperosmolar State (HHS) Fluid Replacement Initial Stabilization : Start with 1–3 litres of 0.9% normal saline over the first 2–3 hours to stabilize hemodynamic status. (Option B) Considerations : HHS involves more significant fluid loss over days to weeks, so the reversal of hyperosmolarity must balance free water repletion and the risk of neurological complications. If serum sodium is >150 mmol/L, use 0.45% saline. Ongoing Fluid Administration : After achieving hemodynamic stability, continue with hypotonic fluids (0.45% saline initially, followed by 5% dextrose in water [D5W]) to correct the free water deficit, which can be as much as 9–10 litres. Administer at a rate of 200–300 mL/hour over 1–2 days. Electrolyte Management Potassium Repletion : Necessary and guided by serum potassium measurements. (Option C ruled out) Consider Diuretics : Patients on diuretics may have significant potassium and magnesium deficits. Address Hypophosphatemia : Can occur during therapy; treated with potassium phosphate (KPO4) and nutritional support. Insulin Therapy Initial Insulin Regimen : Start with an IV insulin bolus of 0.1 unit/kg , followed by a continuous infusion at 0.1 unit/kg/hour . (Option C ruled out) If serum glucose does not decrease, double the insulin infusion rate. Glucose Monitoring : When plasma glucose falls to 11.1-13.9 mmol/L (200–250 mg/dL) , add glucose to IV fluids and decrease insulin infusion to 0.02-0.1 unit/kg/hour. Continuation of Therapy : Insulin infusion should continue until the patient resumes oral intake and can transition to subcutaneous insulin. Post-Hospitalization : Patients should be discharged on insulin, with some able to transition to oral glucose-lowering agents (Option D) later. Treatment Protocol in practice: 1) IV",

      },
      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: C) Kussmaul breathing Explanation: Here, the patient has a Hyperglycemic Hyperosmolar State (HHS) , which is associated with severe hyperglycemia and elevated serum osmolality but lacks significant acidosis . Kussmaul breathing is typically seen in patients with diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) , not HHS. This is because Kussmaul breathing occurs as a compensatory mechanism for metabolic acidosis , where the body attempts to \"blow off\" carbon dioxide (CO I ) to reduce acidity in the blood. Hyperglycemic Hyperosmolar State (HHS) : Clinical Features Typically seen in elderly individuals with type 2 diabetes mellitus. Symptoms : Characterized by a several-week history of: Polyuria Weight loss Diminished oral intake Acute Presentation : May culminate in: Mental confusion Lethargy Coma Physical Exam Findings : Profound dehydration and hyperosmolality Hypotension and tachycardia (Option A & B) Altered mental status Nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, and Kussmaul respirations (Option C) are absent (typical in diabetic ketoacidosis). Precipitating Factors Myocardial infarction Stroke Sepsis and pneumonia Other serious infections (Option D) Prior debilitating conditions (e.g., stroke, dementia) or social situations leading to compromised water intake. Pathophysiology Underlying Causes : Relative insulin deficiency and inadequate fluid intake . Mechanisms : Insulin deficiency leads to: Increased hepatic glucose production ( glycogenolysis and gluconeogenesis ) Impaired glucose utilization in skeletal muscle. Resulting hyperglycemia causes osmotic diuresis, leading to intravascular volume depletion, worsened by inadequate fluid replacement. Absence of Ketosis possibly due to: Less severe insulin deficiency compared to DKA. Lower levels of counterregulatory hormones and free fatty acids. Reduced liver capability for ketone synthesis or an insulin/glucagon ratio unfavourable for ketogenesis. Reference: Harrison’s Principles of Internal Medicine 21st edition Page 3117",

      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: A) Start intravenous fluids and initiate insulin therapy Explanation: Clinical presentation of increased thirst, frequent urination, nausea, and abdominal pain, along with lab findings of blood glucose 350 mg/dL, serum bicarbonate 18 mEq/L, and pH 7.30, indicate Mild diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) with moderate dehydration. According to the ISPAD 2022 guidelines , in patients presenting with signs of moderate dehydration in DKA, the next step is to start intravenous fluids and initiate insulin therapy. Updated Management of Diabetic Ketoacidosis (ISPAD 2022): Contraindication of Insulin Drip: Insulin should be withheld if the serum potassium level is below 3.3 mmol/L. The target is to maintain serum potassium levels above 3.5 mmol/L (3.5 meq/L) to start the insulin drip. Hypokalemia can lead to diaphragmatic paralysis and potentially result in respiratory arrest. Administer subcutaneous insulin and monitor glucose (Option B): Subcutaneous insulin is inappropriate in this case due to the patient's moderate dehydration and the need for intravenous fluids and insulin therapy to effectively manage the acute phase of DKA. Provide oral hydration and adjust the diet accordingly (Option C): Oral hydration is insufficient given the patient's signs of moderate dehydration and potential DKA; intravenous fluids are necessary for proper rehydration and stabilization. Ensure airway patency and consider nasogastric tube insertion (Option D): While airway management may be important in severe cases, it is not the immediate priority here, as the patient’s vital signs and consciousness level do not indicate airway compromise.",

Heart rate: Tachycardia Blood pressure: Hypotension (postural or supine) Respiratory rate: Tachypnea (both depth and rate) Kussmaul breathing: Characterized by tachypnea and increased depth of breath, is a classic sign of DKA. Investigations of DKA: Urine ketostix: Detects acetoacetate and acetate, but cannot detect ß-hydroxybutyrate. Serum ß-hydroxybutyrate: Produced three times more than acetoacetate and is preferred for accurate diagnosis of DKA. Random Blood Sugar: 250 - 600 mg/dL Serum electrolytes: Potassium: Total body potassium deficiency of 3-6 mEq/kg in DKA occurs due to osmotic diuresis and vomiting. Insulin shifts potassium intracellularly, lowering serum levels, and potassium correction with IV potassium chloride (KCl) should be done. Sodium: Serum sodium is reduced due to hyperglycemia: 1.6 meq/L reduction in sodium per 100 mg/dL rise in serum glucose. Dilutional hyponatremia is common due to water driven into the intravascular space from inside cells. Renal function test: Elevated blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and creatinine.
