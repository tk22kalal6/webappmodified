      "question": "A 40-year-old woman presents with a 3-month history of excessive thirst and increased urination. She denies any recent illnesses, medications or head trauma. Her laboratory tests reveal normal serum sodium and osmolality, but her urine is dilute with low osmolality. A fluid deprivation test is performed, and her urine osmolarity remains low despite an increase in plasma osmolality. However, administration of desmopressin (DDAVP) results in a significant increase in urine osmolarity. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?",
      "options": {
        "A": "Central diabetes insipidus",
        "B": "Nephrogenic diabetes insipidus",
        "C": "Psychogenic polydipsia",
        "D": "SIADH"
      },
      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: A) Central diabetes insipidus Explanation: Central diabetes insipidus results from insufficient production or release of antidiuretic hormone (ADH) (also called Arginine vasopressin) from the pituitary gland. The patient's symptoms of excessive thirst (polydipsia) and dilute urine are consistent with diabetes insipidus. The fluid deprivation test, showing persistent dilute urine despite dehydration, suggests a failure of ADH action. The significant increase in urine osmolality after DDAVP administration confirms a central cause, as DDAVP replaces the missing ADH. Feature Central DI Nephrogenic DI (Option B ruled out) Primary Polydipsia Gestational DI Definition Deficiency of AVP (Arginine vasopressin) secretion from the pituitary gland. Kidneys are unable to respond to AVP, even if levels are normal. Excessive water intake, suppressing AVP secretion. Increased activity of placental enzyme degrading AVP during pregnancy. Causes Acquired : Head trauma, tumours, granulomas, infections, inflammation, toxins, vascular events, hypoxia. Acquired : Drugs (lithium, demeclocycline), metabolic disorders (hypercalcaemia, hypokalaemia), obstruction, vascular issues, granulomas, tumours, and infiltration. Dipsogenic : Inappropriate thirst, head trauma, brain diseases. Increased placental vasopressinase activity. Psychogenic : Psychiatric conditions, compulsive water drinking. (Option C ruled out) Genetic : Mutations in the AVP–neurophysin II or WFS1 genes. Genetic : Mutations in the V2 receptor or aquaporin-2 genes. Iatrogenic : Belief in the health benefits of excessive water intake. Basal Plasma AVP Low or undetectable (<1 pg/mL). Normal or elevated (>1 pg/mL). Low due to suppression by excessive water intake. Low due to increased degradation. Urine Osmolarity Low (<280 mOsm/L). Low (<280 mOsm/L). Low (<280 mOsm/L) but can temporarily concentrate with fluid deprivation. Low (<280 mOsm/L). Plasma Osmolarity Increased Increased Decreased Increased Fluid Deprivation Test Urine does not concentrate. AVP or desmopressin injection increases urine osmolarity in severe CDI. Urine does not concentrate. AVP or desmopressin injection has no effect on severe NDI. Plasma osmolarity and sodium increase above normal without urine concentration. Not",

      "question": "A 28-year-old male presents with persistent polyuria and polydipsia. His plasma osmolarity is 310 mOsm/kg, and his urine osmolarity remains low (150 mOsm/L) despite overnight fluid deprivation. Plasma copeptin levels are measured after hypertonic saline infusion and are found to be low. MRI reveals an absent posterior pituitary bright spot. Which of the following genetic mutations is most likely responsible for his condition?",
      "options": {
        "A": "Mutation in the AVP–neurophysin II gene",
        "B": "Mutation in the V2 receptor gene",
        "C": "Mutation in the WFS1 gene",
        "D": "Mutation in the AQP1 gene"
      },
      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: A) Mutation in the AVP–neurophysin II gene Explanation : In the above scenario, the clinical presentation, including low copeptin levels after hypertonic saline infusion, low urine osmolarity and the absence of the posterior pituitary bright spot, all point to central diabetes insipidus (CDI). Mutations in the AVP–neurophysin II gene are commonly associated with genetic forms of central diabetes insipidus (CDI). This mutation leads to a deficiency in AVP synthesis, which aligns with the patient’s symptoms and findings. Feature Central DI Nephrogenic DI Primary Polydipsia Gestational DI Definition Deficiency of AVP secretion from the pituitary gland. Kidneys are unable to respond to AVP, even if levels are normal. Excessive water intake suppresses AVP secretion. Increased activity of placental enzyme degrading AVP during pregnancy.

      "question": "A 60-year-old man with a long-standing history of bipolar disorder, treated with lithium, presents with polyuria and polydipsia. He complains of waking up multiple times at night to urinate. Laboratory tests reveal elevated serum sodium and osmolality with dilute urine. Which of the following is the most appropriate initial management step for this patient?",
      "options": {
        "A": "Desmopressin (DDAVP) 10 mcg intranasally twice daily",
        "B": "Discontinuation of lithium and initiation of a low-sodium diet",
        "C": "Hydrochlorothiazide 25 mg orally once daily",
        "D": "Fluid restriction to 1 litre per day"
      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: B) Discontinuation of lithium and initiation of a low-sodium diet Explanation: The patient's presentation is suggestive of nephrogenic diabetes insipidus (NDI) due to long-term lithium use. Lithium is a known cause of acquired NDI. It interferes with the kidney's ability to concentrate urine in response to vasopressin (AVP). The initial management step for drug-induced NDI is to discontinue the offending drug. In this case, stopping lithium would be the priority. A low-sodium diet is also recommended in NDI management. This helps to reduce urine output. The drug of choice for lithium-induced DI is Amiloride. Desmopressin (DDAVP) 10 mcg intranasally twice daily (Option A): Desmopressin is the treatment of choice for central DI. It is ineffective in NDI, where the kidneys are resistant to the effects of AVP. Hydrochlorothiazide 25 mg orally once daily (Option C): Thiazide diuretics, often in conjunction with amiloride, can be used as adjunctive therapy in NDI to help reduce polyuria. However, discontinuing lithium remains the priority. Fluid restriction to 1 litre per day (Option D): While fluid restriction might seem intuitive, it is not the primary management step. It can also be difficult to maintain and may lead to patient discomfort and potential complications.

      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "being treated with diuretics Correct Answer: C) A 70 y/o male with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) exacerbation being treated with diuretics Explanation : COPD exacerbation with diuretic use is more likely to result in hypovolemia-related hyponatremia (e.g., due to over-diuresis) rather than true SIADH, where the volume status is typically euvolemic. Syndrome of Inappropriate Antidiuretic Hormone Secretion Definition Excessive ADH release leads to impaired water excretion and hyponatremia with euvolemia or hypervolemia. Aetiology CNS disturbances: Stroke, infection, subarachnoid haemorrhage (Option B ruled out) , etc. Malignancies: Small cell lung cancer (most common) , other cancers. Drugs: Carbamazepine (Option D ruled out) , oxcarbazepine, SSRIs, \"Ecstasy\", NSAIDs, etc. Surgery: Pain-induced ADH hypersecretion. Pulmonary diseases: Pneumonia (Option A ruled out) , respiratory failure, etc. Hormone deficiency: Hypopituitarism, hypothyroidism. HIV: Associated with infections. Hereditary SIADH: V2 receptor mutation. Pathophysiology ADH function: Regulates water balance by controlling plasma osmolality; excess ADH causes water retention, leading to hyponatremia. Volume regulation: In hypovolemia, ADH release is driven by volume receptors, worsening hyponatremia. Clinical Presentation Acute hyponatremia : Nausea, vomiting, headache, seizures, coma. Chronic hyponatremia: Nonspecific symptoms ( nausea, confusion, falls in elderly ). Diagnosis Schwartz and Bartter criteria: Serum sodium <135 mEq/L Serum osmolality <275 mOsm/kg Urine sodium >40 mEq/L Urine osmolality >100 mOsm/kg The absence of clinical evidence of volume depletion (like normal skin turgor, blood pressure within the reference range) The absence of hyponatremia due to other causes (like adrenal insufficiency, hypothyroidism, cardiac failure, pituitary insufficiency, renal disease with salt wastage, hepatic disease, and drugs that impair renal water excretion.) Tests: Renal function, serum osmolality, cortisol levels, thyroid tests, imaging for underlying causes. Management Fluid restriction : For mild to moderate symptoms. Hypertonic saline (3%): For severe hyponatremia, with careful correction rate (<8 mEq/L in 24 hrs). Medications: Vasopressin receptor antagonists (Conivaptan, Tolvaptan) Other: Loop diuretics, salt tablets, demeclocycline, lithium. Complications Osmotic demyelination syndrome: Risk from rapid sodium correction. Severe hyponatremia: Can lead to seizures, coma, and death in acute cases.

      "question": "A 62-year-old male with a history of small-cell lung carcinoma presents to the emergency department with confusion, nausea and fatigue. On examination, his volume status appears euvolemic, and lab results show a serum sodium level of 118 mEq/L, serum osmolality of 260 mOsm/kg and urine osmolality of 600 mOsm/kg.

      },
      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: A) Administer hypertonic saline (3% NaCl) Explanation : The above scenario is suggestive of Syndrome of Inappropriate Antidiuretic Hormone Secretion occurring due to small-cell lung carcinoma, and it fits Schwartz and Bartter's criteria. The patient has severe hyponatremia (serum sodium < 120 mEq/L) and symptoms of confusion , which are concerning for potential neurologic complications (e.g., cerebral oedema). In such cases of symptomatic and severe hyponatremia due to SIADH, the initial management should involve careful administration of hypertonic saline (3% NaCl) to rapidly increase serum sodium levels and prevent complications like seizures or brain herniation. Syndrome of Inappropriate Antidiuretic Hormone Secretion Definition Excessive ADH release leads to impaired water excretion and hyponatremia with euvolemia or hypervolemia.

Complications Osmotic demyelination syndrome: Risk from rapid sodium correction. Severe hyponatremia: Can lead to seizures, coma, and death in acute cases. Normal saline (0.9% NaCl) (Option B): It is not appropriate in SIADH as it can worsen hyponatremia due to the body’s retained water. Fluid restriction (Option C): It is the mainstay treatment for mild to moderate SIADH (minimal symptoms, serum sodium > 125 mEq/l) but is not sufficient in the setting of severe symptomatic hyponatremia.

      },
      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: C) Gitelman syndrome Explanation: The above scenario is suggestive of Gitelman syndrome where a mutation in the SLC12A3 gene affects the sodium-chloride cotransporter in the distal convoluted tubule of the kidney, leading to hypokalemia, hypomagnesemia, metabolic alkalosis and hypocalciuria. Common symptoms include fatigue, muscle weakness, and salt cravings. Gitelman syndrome Gitelman syndrome is an autosomal recessive, salt-losing tubulopathy characterized by renal potassium wasting, hypokalemia, metabolic alkalosis, hypocalciuria, hypomagnesemia, and hyperreninemic hyperaldosteronism. It is also known as familial hypokalemia-hypomagnesemia . It is one of the most common inherited tubulopathies. Etiology SLC12A3 gene mutation (thiazide-sensitive NCCT). CLCNKB gene mutation (GS-like phenotype). TRPM6 gene mutation (magnesium transport). Pathophysiology Loss of NCCT function → sodium and chloride wasting. Increased aldosterone → potassium and hydrogen ion loss → hypokalemia, metabolic alkalosis. Reduced TRPM6 expression → hypomagnesemia. Increased calcium reabsorption in proximal tubule → hypocalciuria. Clinical Features Fatigue, muscle weakness, cramps. Salt cravings , thirst. Low blood pressure, joint pain (chondrocalcinosis). Growth retardation, delayed puberty. Cardiac arrhythmias (rare). Laboratory Findings Electrolytes: Hypokalemia, hypomagnesemia, metabolic alkalosis, hypocalciuria. Hormones: Elevated renin, aldosterone. Diagnosis Clinical findings: Chronic hypokalemia, hypomagnesemia, metabolic alkalosis, hypocalciuria. Genetic testing confirms SLC12A3 mutation. Treatment Potassium: High doses of potassium chloride (KCl). Magnesium: Magnesium chloride is preferred. Additional options: Potassium-sparing diuretics (amiloride, spironolactone), NSAIDs (e.g., indomethacin), and renin-angiotensin system blockers. Encourage NaCl intake. Long-term Considerations Risks: Chronic kidney disease, chondrocalcinosis, cardiac arrhythmias, pregnancy complications. Bartter syndrome Gitelman syndrome Liddle syndrome BP Normal/decreased Normal/decreased Increased (Hypertension) Serum Potassium Decreased (hypokalemia) Decreased (hypokalemia) Decreased (hypokalemia) pH Metabolic alkalosis Metabolic alkalosis Metabolic alkalosis Urinary calcium Increased (hypercalciuria) Decreased (hypocalciuria) - Bartter syndrome (Option A): While it also involves hypokalemia and metabolic alkalosis, it typically presents with hypercalciuria and affects the thick ascending loop of Henle, which is not consistent with this patient's hypocalciuria. Liddle syndrome (Option B): This condition is caused by a gain-of-function mutation in the epithelial sodium channels (ENaC) in the collecting ducts of the nephron, leading to increased sodium reabsorption. It results in hypertension, hypokalemia, and metabolic alkalosis without hypomagnesemia or hypocalciuria. It is unrelated to the SLC12A3 gene, which is implicated in Gitelman syndrome. Conn’s syndrome (Option D): Also known as primary hyperaldosteronism, it causes hypertension, hypokalemia, and metabolic alkalosis. However, it does not involve hypocalciuria or SLC12A3 gene mutations, making it unlikely in this case.",

Conn's Syndrome : Characterized by excessive aldosterone production leading to increased sodium reabsorption and potassium excretion. (Primary Hyperaldosteronism) Bartter Syndrome: A defect in the thick ascending limb of the loop of Henle, affecting sodium, potassium, and chloride reabsorption. Diuretic Abuse: Causes electrolyte imbalance and increased urinary loss of sodium, potassium, and chloride. Liddle Syndrome: A gain of function mutation in the epithelial sodium channels leads to increased sodium reabsorption and potassium loss. Some common causes of hypokalemia: Redistribution into cells Presenting Condition Description Insulin Insulin promotes cellular potassium uptake. Excess insulin, especially during the treatment of potassium-deficient states like diabetic ketoacidosis, can lead to hypokalemia. Increased β 2-adrenergic sympathetic activity (Epinephrine) Conditions such as alcohol withdrawal, hyperthyroidism, acute myocardial infarction, and severe head injury increase sympathetic nervous system activity, promoting cellular potassium uptake and hypokalemia. β 2-adrenergic agonists Medications like bronchodilators and tocolytics stimulate cellular potassium uptake, potentially causing hypokalemia. α -adrenergic antagonists These medications can lead to hypokalemia. Thyrotoxic periodic paralysis It involves periodic attacks of muscle weakness due to profound hypokalemia, often accompanied by hypophosphatemia and hypomagnesemia. Theophylline and Caffeine These substances can activate cAMP-dependent signalling, leading to hypokalemia, usually in cases of overdose or significant over-ingestion.
