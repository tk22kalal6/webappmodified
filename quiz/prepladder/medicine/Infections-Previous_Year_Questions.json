      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "0.6 times the serum LDH and protein greater than 0.5 times the serum protein, which are criteria for an exudative pleural effusion according to Light's criteria. Tuberculosis is a common cause of exudative pleural effusion, especially in areas where TB is prevalent. Exudative effusions occur due to increased capillary permeability or lymphatic obstruction, and they are often associated with infections, malignancies, and inflammatory conditions like TB. Incorrect Options: Option B - Heart failure: Heart failure typically causes a transudative pleural effusion, which is characterized by lower protein and LDH levels in the pleural fluid relative to serum levels. This option is incorrect because the fluid described meets the criteria for an exudative effusion, not a transudative one. Option C - Hepatic failure: Hepatic failure (such as in cirrhosis) usually causes a transudative pleural effusion due to low oncotic pressure from hypoalbuminemia, not an exudative effusion. Therefore, it is not the most likely diagnosis in this scenario. Option D - Renal failure: Renal failure can cause pleural effusions, but they are typically transudative unless complicated by infections or other factors. The described pleural fluid characteristics are more consistent with an exudative process.",

      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: B) Secondary syphilis Explanation: The classical rash and other symptoms point to the diagnosis of secondary syphilis . Classic Manifestations of secondary syphilis: Mucocutaneous or cutaneous lesions and generalized non-tender lymphadenopathy. The primary chancre may still be present in ~15% of cases, more common in HIV-infected individuals. Skin Rash: Macular, papular, papulosquamous, and occasionally pustular syphilides. Lesions may be subtle, and 25% of patients with a visible rash may not recognize it. Lesions initially present as pale red or pink, non-pruritic macules on the trunk/extremities. Progress to papular lesions, often affecting palms and soles. Severe necrotic lesions (lues maligna) may occur in HIV patients. Hair and Mucosal Involvement: Patchy alopecia of the scalp, eyebrows, or beard in 5% of cases. Condylomata lata (moist, infectious lesions) may form in intertriginous areas (e.g., perianal, vulva, scrotum) in 10% of cases. Mucous patches (painless silver-grey erosions) occur in 10-15% of patients, commonly in the oral or genital mucosa. Constitutional Symptoms: Sore throat (15–30%), fever (5–8%), weight loss (2–20%), malaise (25%), anorexia (2–10%), headache (10%), and meningismus (5%). Acute meningitis occurs in 1-2% of cases, with up to 40% of early syphilis cases showing CSF abnormalities. Ocular and Otic Involvement: Ocular symptoms: pupillary abnormalities, optic neuritis, iritis, or uveitis; may lead to permanent blindness if untreated. Otic symptoms: sensorineural hearing loss, vertigo, or tinnitus. Prompt diagnosis and treatment are crucial for preventing long-term damage. Less Common Complications: Hepatitis, nephropathy, gastrointestinal issues (e.g., hypertrophic gastritis, proctitis), arthritis, and periostitis. Hepatic involvement is common but typically asymptomatic. Renal",

        "D": "Can be cultured in a cell-free medium"
      },
      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: A) Responds well to Amoxiclav Explanation : Amoxiclav, which is a combination of amoxicillin and clavulanic acid, is not considered a first-line treatment for Mycoplasma pneumonia. The drug of choice for Mycoplasma pneumoniae is Azithromycin. Atypical Pneumonia (Walking Pneumonia) Definition Atypical pneumonia is a milder form of pneumonia, often caused by Mycoplasma pneumoniae, certain viruses, or moulds. Symptoms Cough, fever, chest pain, headache, and chills, resembling a bad cold. As it is generally mild, not requiring bed rest or hospitalization, allowing people to continue daily activities called \"walking pneumonia.\" Etiologic Agents Atypical pneumonia is caused by organisms that don't grow on standard cultures or appear on Gram stain , such as: Mycoplasma pneumonia (associated with closed living conditions like at school and military barracks) Chlamydia pneumoniae Legionella species (from stagnant water sources or from air conditioners) Respiratory viruses: Influenza, adenoviruses, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), human metapneumoviruses, and coronaviruses (e.g., SARS-CoV-2) Prevalence Cases of atypical pneumonia are increasing, particularly among young adults. Diagnosis These pathogens cannot be cultured in the usual ways, making diagnosis more complex. Mycoplasma pneumoniae is a unique bacterium that lacks a cell wall and requires a specialized cell-free medium for culture (Option D) as it cannot be grown on conventional culture media. Detection of specific antibodies (Option B) (IgM and IgG) against Mycoplasma pneumoniae, can be helpful in confirming the diagnosis. PCR and other molecular methods are often necessary for confirmation. Radiology Chest X-ray findings in Mycoplasma pneumonia can vary, but bilateral infiltrates (Option C) are commonly seen. Infiltrates may appear as patchy or diffuse opacities in both lungs. However, chest X-ray findings alone cannot definitively diagnose Mycoplasma pneumonia and should be correlated with clinical symptoms and other diagnostic tests. Treatment The absence of a cell wall makes these organisms resistant to certain antibiotics that target cell wall synthesis, such as penicillins and cephalosporins and require treatment with macrolides like azithromycin, and fluoroquinolones, or tetracyclines like doxycycline.

        "D": "Start ATT and ART simultaneously"
      },
      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: C) Start ATT and then ART after 2 weeks Explanation: The appropriate management in an HIV patient with tuberculosis (TB) is to start antitubercular therapy (ATT) first and then initiate antiretroviral therapy (ART) after 2-8 weeks of ATT to avoid the risk of immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome (IRIS). HIV and TB Co-infection: Increased Risk: People with HIV are 18-26 times more likely to develop active TB than those without HIV. HIV weakens the immune system, reducing CD4 T-cell counts, which are essential for controlling TB infection. This allows TB to progress from latent to active disease. The underlying mechanism of IRIS is due to an imbalance between anti-inflammatory cytokines and pro-inflammatory cytokines that occurs rapidly after the recovery of immune function in HIV patients initiated on HAART. Screening and Diagnosis: Testing for Both Conditions: Patients with TB should be tested for HIV, and vice versa, given the high co-infection rate. Diagnostic Challenges: TB symptoms can overlap with other opportunistic infections in HIV patients. Tests like sputum culture, X-rays, and newer rapid molecular tests (GeneXpert) help in diagnosing TB in HIV-positive patients. Treatment of Co-Infection: Anti-TB Therapy : This involves the standard TB drug regimen, usually with a 6-month course. Treatment may extend for cases of drug-resistant TB. Instead of Rifampicin, Rifabutin is preferred in patients receiving protease inhibitors due to its property of being a less potent inducer of CYP3A4. Antiretroviral Therapy (ART) : Initiating ART is crucial for improving immune function. ART is typically started 2-8 weeks after beginning TB treatment to prevent immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome (IRIS) , depending on CD4 count and clinical status. Drug Interactions: TB drugs, like rifampicin, can interact with ART drugs, requiring careful selection of the ART regimen to minimize side effects and maintain effectiveness.

      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "respiratory tract infection and a CD4 count of less than 200 cells/cu.mm. Co-trimoxazole, a combination of sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim, is commonly used in AIDS patients with cough due to its effectiveness against Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia (PJP). PJP is an opportunistic infection that affects individuals with weakened immune systems, such as those with advanced HIV/AIDS. Amoxicillin-clavulanic acid + Azithromycin (Option A) : This combination is typically used for community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) , which often shows lobar infiltrates on chest X-ray . However, the normal chest X-ray and the high CD4 threshold for bacterial pneumonia make this less likely. Also, CAP typically presents with chills and rigors , which are absent here. Amphotericin B (Option B) : This is the drug of choice for disseminated fungal infections such as cryptococcal meningitis or visceral leishmaniasis . However, there is no evidence of cryptococcal infection (e.g., no headache, altered sensorium, or nuchal rigidity), and the patient’s symptoms are respiratory, not systemic. Antitubercular treatment (ATT) (Option D) : Tuberculosis (TB) is common in HIV patients, but it usually presents with chronic symptoms like prolonged cough, weight loss, night sweats, and upper lobe infiltrates on chest X-ray . The acute nature of the illness (5 days of symptoms) and normal chest X-ray make TB less likely. Reference: Reference: Harrison's Principles of Internal Medicine, 21st Edition, Page 1563 -1567",

The rK39 antigen test detects antibodies against Leishmania donovani, the causative agent of visceral leishmaniasis. The treatment of choice for Kala-azar is Amphotericin B, particularly liposomal Amphotericin B, due to its high efficacy and safety profile. Griseofulvin ( Option B) is an antifungal medication that works by inhibiting microtubule function , thereby interfering with fungal mitosis. It is primarily used for treating superficial fungal infections like tinea capitis and onychomycosis . Dapsone ( Option C) is an antimicrobial drug that inhibits dihydropteroate synthase , disrupting folic acid metabolism. It is mainly used in leprosy (Hansen’s disease) as part of multi-drug therapy (MDT) and for Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia (PCP) prophylaxis in immunocompromised patients. Hydroxychloroquine (Option D) is an immunomodulatory drug that interferes with antigen presentation by lysosomes.

By this time, the disease has already progressed significantly, making it unsuitable for early diagnosis. Stool culture (Option C): This investigation typically becomes positive in the third week of illness when bacteria are shed in the feces. It is not useful for early diagnosis as bacterial shedding in stool occurs later in the disease course. Antibody detection (Option D): The Widal test for antibody detection is generally performed in the second week of illness, as antibodies take time to develop. The test has low sensitivity and specificity in the first week. Reference: Harrison's Principles of Internal Medicine, 21th Edition, Pages 1292-1295",

      },
      "correct_answer": "D",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer D - Stenotrophomonas The microorganism that exhibits intrinsic resistance to meropenem and aminoglycosides but sensitive to cotrimoxazole is Stenotrophomonas . Stenotrophomonas maltophilia is a non-fermenting gram-negative rod, similar to Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Acinetobacter . Risk factors: Chronic respiratory diseases (e.g., cystic fibrosis) Hematologic malignancies, chemotherapy-induced neutropenia Organ transplants, HIV infection, hemodialysis, neonates Hospital settings, ICU stays, mechanical ventilation, tracheostomies Central venous catheters, severe burns, trauma, mucosal damage, and prolonged antibiotic use increase the risk. Management: First-line treatment: Trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMX) (co-trimoxazole) at high doses (15 mg/kg of trimethoprim component). Alternative treatments: Fluoroquinolones (e.g., levofloxacin, moxifloxacin) have good efficacy, particularly in lung infections. Minocycline and tigecycline show high effectiveness (80-100% susceptibility). Ticarcillin-clavulanic acid, ceftazidime, colistin, and chloramphenicol can be considered. Emerging treatments: New agents like Cefiderocol, Eravacycline, Omadacycline, and Delafloxacin show promising in-vitro activity. Combination therapies (e.g., TMP-SMX/ciprofloxacin, ticarcillin-clavulanate/aztreonam) have demonstrated synergistic effects. Challenges: Resistance to many common antibiotics like meropenem, and aminoglycosides is rising, necessitating new treatments. Studies on aerosolized antibiotics, bacteriophage therapy, and other innovative approaches are ongoing. Duration of treatment: Pneumonia: Typically 7 days, extended to 10-14 days in immunocompromised patients. Bacteremia: Generally treated for 14 days. Source control: Surgical removal of infected devices (e.g., central venous catheters) and drainage of infected collections is critical for successful treatment. Option A, B, and C: These organisms are susceptible to meropenem and aminoglycosides. Reference: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK572123/",

      },
      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer C - Decreased IgG and increase in IgM When there is an absence of the CD40 ligand in the B lymphocytes, they cannot switch, leading to the production of only IgM and hence will have a normal or increased IgM level (hyper IgM syndrome). Hyper IgM syndrome A rare primary immunodeficiency disorder characterised by low or absent IgG, IgA, and IgE, with normal or increased IgM levels. Causes: Results from various X-linked or autosomal mutations. Clinical Manifestations: Pulmonary complications (e.g., infections) Gastrointestinal issues Autoimmune diseases Hematologic abnormalities Lymphoproliferation Increased risk of malignancies Diagnosis: Based on immunoglobulin levels and genetic testing. Management: Treatment varies depending on the genetic mutation and clinical presentation. Options may include immunoglobulin replacement therapy, antibiotics, and management of associated complications. Prognosis: Depends on the severity of symptoms and timely treatment, but early diagnosis and management can improve outcomes. A total lack of NK cells (Option A) or natural killer deficiency is a rare genetic disorder that has a genetic mechanism causing it. This is not associated with hyper IgM syndrome. Lack of CD8-mediated cytotoxicity (Option B) can be as a result of many chronic autoimmune diseases (like multiple sclerosis, rheumatoid arthritis, SLE, etc). It can also be seen in healthy blood relatives of people with autoimmune disorders. However, it is not associated with increased IgM production. The inability of neutrophils to act against infections (Option D) is not associated with the absence of CD40 ligand of B cells. Reference: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30439505/",

      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "treatment Correct Answer: B) Delay antiretroviral therapy by 4-6 weeks after the initiation of antifungal treatment Explanation: The patient has signs and symptoms of meningitis, which, along with the positive India ink stain leads to the diagnosis of Cryptococcal meningitis, which is a CNS complication of HIV occurring due to opportunistic infection by Cryptococcus neoformans. Fungal Meningitis in AIDS The leading cause of meningitis in AIDS patients is primarily Cryptococcus neoformans (C. neoformans), with C. gattii accounting for up to 12% of cases. Cryptococcal meningitis is common in patients with CD4+ T-cell counts <100/ µ L, especially in untreated AIDS patients. Symptoms: Subacute meningoencephalitis with fever, nausea, vomiting, altered mental status, headache, and meningeal signs Seizures and focal neurologic deficits are rare Elevated intracranial pressure (Option A) CSF Findings: Mild increase in WBCs and protein Low glucose Elevated opening pressure Diagnosis: CSF: Positive India ink examination Cryptococcal antigen detection in CSF Blood cultures may also be positive A biopsy may be needed for CNS cryptococcoma or distinguishing from immune reconstitution syndrome MRI: Soap bubble appearance is seen in less than 30% of cases (Option D) Treatment: Initial: IV Amphotericin B with Flucytosine for at least 2 weeks. (Option C) Continued with Amphotericin until CSF culture is negative, followed by Fluconazole (400 mg/d) for 8 weeks and then 200 mg/d until CD4+ T-cell count >200/ µ L for 6 months. Repeated lumbar punctures may be needed to manage elevated intracranial pressure. Immune Reconstitution Syndrome : Occurs after initiating effective ART, leading to worsening of pre-existing opportunistic infections or autoimmune conditions. Types of IRIS: Paradoxical IRIS: Exacerbation of known pre-existing infections or neoplasms. Unmasking IRIS: Emergence of previously undiagnosed conditions. Immune Reconstitution Disease (IRD) : Refers to IRIS related to opportunistic infections or autoimmune diseases. Symptoms : Lymphadenitis Prolonged fever Pulmonary infiltrates Hepatitis Increased intracranial pressure Uveitis Sarcoidosis Graves’ disease Mechanism : Related to type IV hypersensitivity reactions due to immune recovery as HIV RNA levels drop and immune suppression is reversed. Management : Severe cases may require immunosuppressive drugs (e.g., glucocorticoids) alongside specific antimicrobial therapy. Due to the risk of IRIS (immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome), ART should be deferred by 4-6 weeks after the initiation of antifungal treatment. Other Causes: Other fungi like C. immitis and H. capsulatum , as well as amoebas like Acanthamoeba and Naegleria , can cause meningitis in HIV-infected individuals.

Recent guidelines recommend IV doxycycline with Azithromycin as combination therapy has shown better outcomes than monotherapy, making it the preferred treatment choice. Causative agent Orientia tsutsugamushi, an intracellular bacterium. Transmission Bites of infected larval stage mites (chiggers). These are often found in rural areas, forests, and grasslands. Clinical features Fever Headache Muscle pain Eschar: Blackish scab at the site of the chigger bite Rash Lymphadenopathy Diagnosis Serology: Detection of antibodies in blood PCR: Molecular detection of the bacterium Management Recent update: According to a recent update, combination therapy with IV doxycycline and Azithromycin is more effective than monotherapy. Doxycycline : (Option A) First-line treatment for scrub typhus. Administered at 100 mg IV or orally, twice daily for 7 to 14 days. Concerns about potential doxycycline resistance in some cases. Azithromycin : Alternative to Doxycycline, especially if resistance is suspected. Shorter treatment duration Effective penetration into key immune cells (polymorphonuclear leukocytes and macrophages) enhances efficacy. Rifampicin : A second-line option, not first-line.

Kaposi's Sarcoma (KS) is a vascular tumor caused by human herpesvirus 8 (HHV-8), often seen in HIV/AIDS patients and classified as an AIDS-defining condition. It affects the skin, oral cavity, and internal organs like the lungs and gastrointestinal tract. Clinical Stages: Patch Stage: Flat, pink or red lesions. Plaque Stage: Raised, purple or brown lesions. Nodular Stage: Firm, raised nodules, may ulcerate. Variants: Classic KS: Affects elderly men of Mediterranean or Eastern European descent. Endemic KS: Common in sub-Saharan Africa, affecting younger individuals. Transplant-associated KS: Seen in organ transplant recipients on immunosuppressive therapy. AIDS-associated KS: Seen in HIV-positive individuals, especially those with low CD4 counts. Pathophysiology: Caused by HHV-8, which infects endothelial cells, leading to angiogenesis and tumor growth. Diagnosis: Confirmed by biopsy showing spindle-shaped cells, angiogenesis, and extravasated red blood cells. PCR or serology for HHV-8 can be used for detection. Management: ART: Restores immune function in HIV/AIDS, reducing KS lesions. Chemotherapy: Liposome-encapsulated doxorubicin or paclitaxel for advanced KS. Radiotherapy: Effective for localized lesions. Surgical Treatment: Cryotherapy or excision for small lesions. Basal cell carcinoma (Option A): This skin cancer typically presents as a pearly, nodular lesion, usually on sun-exposed areas, and does not have the violaceous coloration seen in Kaposi sarcoma.

Histoplasmosis A systemic fungal infection caused by Histoplasma capsulatum, a dimorphic fungus endemic in regions like the Ohio and Mississippi River valleys, Central/South America, and Africa. Pathophysiology: Acquired by inhaling fungal microconidia from contaminated soil (bird/bat droppings). Yeast forms multiply in macrophages, spreading through lymphatics and bloodstream. Immunocompromised hosts (e.g., HIV/AIDS, CD4+ <200/ µ L) are at higher risk of dissemination. Clinical Features: Asymptomatic: Common in immunocompetent individuals. Acute Pulmonary: Fever, cough, chest pain, flu-like symptoms. Chronic Pulmonary: Associated with COPD, presenting with cough, weight loss, and cavitary lung lesions. Progressive Disseminated Histoplasmosis (PDH): Systemic: Fever, weight loss, hepatosplenomegaly, thrombocytopenia. Lungs: Diffuse interstitial or reticulonodular infiltrates. Skin: Papules, plaques, or ulcers (~10% cases). Diagnosis: Antigen detection: Urine, serum, or BAL fluid. Culture: Blood, bone marrow, or BAL fluid (gold standard, slow). Histopathology: Yeast forms in macrophages (PAS/GMS stains). Imaging: Chest X-ray or CT shows infiltrates or cavitary lesions. Treatment: Mild to Moderate: Itraconazole for 6–12 months. Severe/PDH: Liposomal amphotericin B (induction) followed by itraconazole (maintenance for ≥ 12 months). Chronic Pulmonary: Itraconazole for 12–24 months. HIV with disseminated cryptococcosis (Option B): Cryptococcosis is commonly associated with meningeal involvement in immunocompromised patients. This patient's symptoms (including the skin lesions and lung involvement) do not suggest cryptococcosis, especially as there are no signs of meningitis. HIV with molluscum contagiosum (Option C): Molluscum contagiosum is a skin infection caused by a poxvirus, typically characterized by umbilicated papules on the skin. While this patient does have skin lesions, the lung involvement and the bilateral nodular infiltrates on the chest x-ray point to a systemic fungal infection rather than a localized skin condition. HIV with tuberculosis (Option D): Tuberculosis would typically present with symptoms like cough, hemoptysis, and weight loss. However, the patient's negative sputum CBNAAT for tuberculosis and absence of granulomas on imaging make tuberculosis less likely.

      "question": "An HIV-positive man presents with a high-grade fever. Examination reveals a positive Kernig's sign. CSF shows reduced glucose, increased protein, and increased leukocytes. A diagnosis of cryptococcal meningitis is made. What is the appropriate management for this patient?",

        "A": "Vancomycin",
        "B": "High dose fluconazole with flucytosine",
        "C": "Voriconazole",
        "D": "Liposomal amphotericin B"
      },
      "correct_answer": "D",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer D- Liposomal amphotericin B For the given HIV-positive patient with cryptococcal meningitis, Liposomal amphotericin B is the preferred initial therapy due to its higher efficacy and better penetration into the central nervous system . The treatment regimen consists of liposomal amphotericin B (L-AMB) combined with 5-flucytosine for 2 weeks as induction therapy, followed by fluconazole for 6 weeks as consolidation therapy. Cryptococcal Meningitis Common Cause The leading infectious cause of meningitis in AIDS patients is primarily due to Cryptococcus neoformans (C. neoformans); C. gattii accounts for up to 12%. Clinical Presentation Symptoms include fever, nausea, vomiting, altered mental status, headache, and meningeal signs. Low incidence of seizures and focal neurological deficits. Kernig’s Sign- Positive when passive extension of the knee elicits pain; indicative of meningeal irritation. CSF Profile It may be normal or show modest elevations in WBC and protein levels. Decreased glucose levels may be observed. Elevated CSF opening pressure is typical. Diagnosis Identification of organisms via India ink examination of CSF. Detection of cryptococcal antigen in CSF or blood. Blood cultures for fungi are often positive. The biopsy may be necessary for diagnosing CNS cryptococcoma and to differentiate it from immune reconstitution syndrome. Induction therapy IV amphotericin B (0.7 mg/kg daily) or liposomal amphotericin (4–6 mg/kg daily) plus flucytosine (25 mg/kg qid) for at least 2 weeks. Monitor renal function to avoid flucytosine toxicity. Maintenance Therapy Amphotericin should be continued until CSF culture is negative, followed by fluconazole (400 mg/d PO for 8 weeks, then 200 mg/d) until CD4+ T-cell count >200 cells/ µ L for 6 months. Vancomycin (Option A): Vancomycin is primarily used to treat bacterial infections, particularly those caused by methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). It has no activity against Cryptococcus neoformans, and would be ineffective in treating cryptococcal meningitis. High dose fluconazole with flucytosine (Option B): While these antifungal medications are used in cryptococcal meningitis treatment, they are not the optimal initial therapy for severe cases. High-dose fluconazole with flucytosine lacks the rapid fungicidal activity of liposomal amphotericin B and is reserved for maintenance therapy or cases where amphotericin B is contraindicated. Voriconazole (Option C): Voriconazole is primarily used to treat invasive aspergillosis and other filamentous fungal infections. It is not the drug of choice for cryptococcal meningitis as it has limited evidence for efficacy against Cryptococcus neoformans compared to the standard regimen.",

        "D": "Klebsiella"
      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer B- Legionella The clinical manifestations indicate a severe form of pneumonia known as Legionnaires' disease .The presentation includes high-grade fever, cough, confusion, along with hyponatremia and elevated liver enzymes . It is a strict aerobe that is poorly stained with gram stain , explaining the negative gram stain results despite active infection. The patient's immunocompromised status (HIV positive) and age further increase the risk for Legionella infection. Legionnaires' Disease General Features Incubation period: 2-10 days Non-specific flu-like symptoms initially Often more severe than typical pneumonia Clinical Features Respiratory Dry cough Shortness of breath Chest pain Systemic High fever (102-105°F) Headache Myalgias Fatigue Gastrointestinal Diarrhea Nausea/vomiting Abdominal pain Diagnosis Laboratory Tests Blood Analysis- Hyponatremia, Elevated Liver Enzymes Urinary Antigen- Most common test, rapid results, detects L. pneumophila serogroup-1 Culture- Gold standard, requires special media, takes 3-5 days PCR Imaging Findings Chest X-ray: Focal infiltrates/consolidation, predominantly lower lobes CT: Ground-glass opacities, consolidation, pleural effusions possible Can be multilobar in immunocompromised patients Treatment Mild-Moderate Disease: Azithromycin 500mg PO daily Levofloxacin 750mg PO daily Clarithromycin 500mg PO BID Severe Disease: Levofloxacin 750mg IV daily Azithromycin 500mg IV daily Consider combination therapy for severe cases Streptococcus (Option A): Streptococcus pneumoniae is a common cause of community-acquired pneumonia, but it typically presents with a productive cough with rust-colored sputum. In this case, the sputum gram stain did not detect any organisms, making Streptococcus less likely. Additionally, the extrapulmonary symptoms are not typical for pneumococcal pneumonia. Pneumocystis jiroveci (Option C): While the patient is HIV positive, the symptoms described and chest X-ray findings of bilateral infiltrates are not specific to Pneumocystis jiroveci pneumonia. PJP typically presents with a more gradual onset of dry cough and progressive dyspnea without the characteristic hyponatremia and liver enzyme elevation seen here. Also, chest X-ray shows pneumatoceles or thin-walled cysts and reticular opacities with septal thickening. Klebsiella (Option D): Klebsiella causes pneumonia in individuals with a history of alcoholism or COPD. While the patient has a smoking history, the clinical presentation (including confusion and diarrhea) is inconsistent with Klebsiella pneumonia infection. Additionally, Klebsiella would typically be visible on gram stain. Reference: Harrison's Principles of Internal Medicine, 21st Edition, Page 1254-1257",

      },
      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer C- Negative skin tuberculin test and negative chest X-ray Cryptic tuberculosis is a rare and atypical presentation of tuberculosis where there is absence of both tuberculin skin test response (negative) and radiological findings on chest X-ray (negative) , despite active Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection. The standard diagnostic tools - tuberculin skin test (which measures delayed hypersensitivity response to M. tuberculosis antigens) and chest X-ray (which typically shows parenchymal infiltrates) - may not detect tuberculosis infection in its cryptic form. In its severe form, known as cryptic miliary TB , the condition can lead to pancytopenia and massive hematogenous dissemination , with postmortem findings revealing multiple necrotic, nongranulomatous lesions. Positive skin tuberculin test and negative chest X-ray (Option A) indicates a hypersensitivity response to M. tuberculosis without radiological evidence of active disease. This pattern typically suggests latent tuberculosis infection. Positive skin tuberculin test and positive chest X-ray (Option B) represents the classical presentation of active pulmonary tuberculosis with both immunological response and radiological changes. In Cryptic tuberculosis, both these findings are absent. Negative skin tuberculin test and positive chest X-ray (Option D) suggests active pulmonary disease without measurable immune response, commonly seen in immunocompromised states . While this can occur in some forms of TB, it does not represent cryptic tuberculosis where both tests are characteristically negative.
