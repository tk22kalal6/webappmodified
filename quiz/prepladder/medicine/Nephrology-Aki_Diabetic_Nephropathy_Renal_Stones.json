      "question": "A 60-year-old male with a history of hypertension and diabetes presents with a 3-day history of decreased urine output, nausea, and generalized weakness. He was recently started on angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors for blood pressure control. On examination, his blood pressure is 100/60 mmHg, heart rate is 96 bpm, and he appears dehydrated with dry mucous membranes. His urine output has decreased to 200 mL over the past 24 hours. Serum creatinine: 2.2 mg/dL (baseline 1.0 mg/dL) Blood urea nitrogen (BUN): 28 mg/dL (baseline 14 mg/dL) Urine sodium: 10 mEq/L Fractional excretion of sodium (FENa): 1.2% Urine osmolality: 500 mOsm/kg Based on this patient's clinical presentation and laboratory findings, which phase of acute kidney injury (AKI) is he most likely experiencing?",

      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: B) Maintenance Phase Explanation: This patient is most likely in the Maintenance Phase / Oliguric phase of AKI. Phases of AKI: Initiation Phase : The initial injury occurs, but the signs and symptoms are often subtle, and changes in creatinine and BUN may not be significant yet. Maintenance Phase : The kidney injury stabilizes, and the patient shows oliguria or anuria , with rising levels of creatinine and BUN. This phase can last from a few days to weeks. Diuretic phase: The kidneys try to heal by increasing urine output, but tubule damage and scarring may occur . Recovery Phase : Kidney function begins to improve, creatinine and BUN decrease, and urine output increases. Elevated Serum Creatinine and BUN : The patient's serum creatinine has increased to 2.2 mg/dL (from a baseline of 1.0 mg/dL), and BUN is elevated, indicating that kidney function is impaired. Oliguria (Low Urine Output) : The patient is producing 200 mL of urine over 24 hours , which is oliguria , a hallmark of the maintenance phase of AKI. In this phase, urine output may be significantly reduced or absent. Stable but Impaired Kidney Function : In the maintenance phase , renal function plateaus and does not improve immediately. This phase can last for days to weeks, and is often characterized by worsening azotemia (elevated creatinine and BUN), fluid retention, and electrolyte imbalances. The patient's clinical signs, including dehydration and nausea, are consistent with this phase. Urine Sodium and FENa : The patient's urine sodium is 10 mEq/L , and FENa is 1.2% . These values suggest some degree of renal dysfunction with an impaired ability to concentrate urine. In the maintenance phase , kidney function is impaired, and the kidneys may struggle to regulate sodium and water properly. Initiation Phase(Option A) : The initiation phase is the earliest phase of AKI and is characterized by the onset of kidney injury. At this stage, serum creatinine and BUN may not yet show significant changes, and the clinical signs may be subtle. Recovery Phase(Option C) : The recovery phase is characterized by an improvement in kidney function, where creatinine levels start to decline and urine output increases. Diuretic phase (Option D) : The kidneys try to heal by increasing urine output, but tubule damage and scarring may occur .

      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: A) Ureteric stone Explanation: The clinical scenario of sharp flank pain radiating to the groin, associated with nausea, vomiting, and hematuria, is classic for renal colic due to a ureteric stone. The ultrasound is essential for diagnosing the stone, assessing obstruction, and ruling out complications. Clinical manifestations of Renal stones: Renal colic is typically characterised by severe, sharp, and fluctuating pain originating in the flank and radiating toward the lower abdomen or groin, based on the location of the stone within the ureter. Upper ureteral stone: Pain radiates anteriorly. Lower ureteral stone: Pain radiates to the ipsilateral groin or labium in females/testicles in males. Hematuria is a common finding due to ureteral irritation and damage caused by the sharp edges of the stone. Nausea and vomiting are frequently present due to the intensity of pain and reno-gastric reflex. Acute pyelonephritis (Option B): Presents with fever, costovertebral angle tenderness, and systemic symptoms like chills, which are absent in this case. Acute appendicitis (Option C) typically starts with periumbilical pain that localises to the right lower quadrant without radiating flank pain or hematuria. Ectopic pregnancy (Option D) : Must be ruled out in any female of childbearing age presenting with lower abdominal pain; however, this condition is more likely to involve vaginal bleeding, hypotension, and reproductive history concerns.

      },
      "correct_answer": "D",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: D) Renal vein thrombosis Explanation: Renal vein thrombosis can cause painful unilateral kidney enlargement and can lead to kidney damage, and it does not usually cause bilateral kidney enlargement. It usually affects one kidney due to a blockage of the renal vein , resulting in localised changes rather than bilateral enlargement. It can happen due to diarrhea, dehydration in children and membranous glomerulonephropathy in adults , along with RCC and presents with a shorter history along with AKI. Causes of Renal Enlargement Bilateral Unilateral Can be either Diabetic nephropathy (most common) HIV nephropathy (FSGS) Amyloidosis Polycystic kidney disease Leukaemia Sickle cell disease Acromegaly Renal vein thrombosis Renal artery infarction Hydronephrosis Acute pyelonephritis Renal lymphoma HIV nephropathy (Option A) is characterised by proteinuria and progressive renal impairment associated with HIV infection, often related to focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS) and causes bilateral kidney enlargement . Amyloidosis (Option B) is an abnormal accumulation of amyloid proteins in tissues and organs, leading to dysfunction and potential organ failure. It mostly causes bilateral kidney enlargement. Polycystic kidney disease (Option C) causes bilateral kidney enlargement due to numerous cysts that progressively replace normal kidney tissue. As the cysts grow, they enlarge the kidneys and can impair kidney function over time. ADPKD",

      "correct_answer": "D",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: D) Start an ACE inhibitor. Explanation: Starting ACE inhibitors early in the progression of diabetic nephropathy, particularly with the presence of microalbuminuria, has demonstrated significant benefits in reducing the risk of kidney failure and cardiovascular events . Management of Diabetic nephropathy Oral Hypoglycemic agents (OHAs) SGLT2 inhibitors lower the risk of cardiovascular events and renal failure; they are also recently approved for HFpEF. For HbA1C < 9.5%, OHAs can be used Metformin is withheld if eGFR is < 30 mL/min/1.73 m2 (Option C) , and drugs safe in renal failure can be used like Glipizide Linagliptin Repaglinide Insulin 80% of the calculated dose is started if HbA1C > 9.5% (Option B) Antihypertensives In the presence of microalbuminuria, ACEi and ARBs have shown evidence to slow the progression of nephropathy if started in early stages. In hypertension, for BP > 130/90, ACEi or ARBs are preferred If BP is still not under control, Calcium channel blocker (CCB) can be added Thiazide diuretic - in the presence of oedema (Option A) If eGFR <30 ml/min, then the diuretic used - Metolazone. ACEi/ARB comes with a side effect of hyperkalemia; hence, regular monitoring of potassium is necessary. In the presence of hyperkalemia , ACEi/ARB is replaced by CCB Alpha blocker (Prazosin) - hyperkalemia in ESRD.

      "correct_answer": "D",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: D) Stage 1 Explanation: Microalbuminuria is an early marker of diabetic nephropathy, typically occurring in Stage 1, which is characterized by glomerular hyperfiltration and increased permeability of the glomerular basement membrane. It reflects early kidney damage, even before significant reductions in glomerular filtration rate (GFR) are seen. Without intervention, this may progress to more advanced stages of nephropathy. Stages of Diabetic nephropathy Stage 1 Is the stage of glomerular hyperfiltration due to nephron hypertrophy and hyperplasia, leading to microalbuminuria (30 - 330 mg/day) It is a reversible condition of management. Stage 2 It takes more than 10 years to progress from stage 1 Microalbuminuria is seen in almost all the patients in this stage BP is usually normal; 24-hour ambulatory BP can show absent nocturnal dipping and wide pulse pressure.

      "explanation": "Correct Answer: C) Glycation leading to mesangial expansion Explanation: The diagnosis, in this case, is Diabetic nephropathy, a common complication of long-standing type 2 diabetes mellitus characterized by worsening renal function and significant proteinuria. In diabetic nephropathy, elevated blood glucose levels result in the formation of advanced glycation end products (AGEs) that contribute to structural changes in the kidneys, including mesangial expansion and increased permeability of the glomerular capillaries, leading to the leakage of protein into the urine. Hyperfiltration due to upregulation of sglt-1 and sglt-2, and activation of RAS. This hyperfiltration leads to the accumulation of AGE in GBM. Diabetic Nephropathy Pathogenesis Risk Factors Uncontrolled DM Hypertension Dyslipidemia Smoking Family history of diabetic nephropathy Genetic predispositions Other microvascular complications Progression > 5 years in type 1 diabetes Gradual (> 10 - 20 years) in type 2 diabetes. Screening By regularly monitoring AER and serum creatinine . Albumin of 30-300 mg/gm is moderate albuminuria. False positive albuminuria can be seen in Hypertension Congestive heart failure Pyelonephritis Serum creatinine is not an early finding, as it only increases after increased kidney damage. Complement-mediated glomerular injury (Option A) : This mechanism is typically associated with conditions like lupus nephritis or post-infectious glomerulonephritis, not primarily with diabetic nephropathy. Immune complex deposition (Option B) : While this can lead to glomerular injury in conditions such as IgA nephropathy or lupus, it is not the primary mechanism in diabetic nephropathy. Autoantibody-mediated podocyte (Option D) damage refers to injury of podocytes due to autoantibodies, observed in conditions like minimal change disease, focal segmental glomerulosclerosis, and lupus nephritis. However, this mechanism is not the primary cause of proteinuria in diabetic nephropathy, where glycation leads to mesangial expansion predominates.",

      "explanation": "Correct Answer: D) 1,2,4 Explanation: The patient presents with findings consistent with AKI leading to hyperkalemia and metabolic acidosis, which may be attributed to the use of ARBs or antibiotics for her recent infection. Insulin infusion with dextrose is effective in managing hyperkalemia, and Telmisartan (ARB) should be discontinued as it may exacerbate the condition. Metabolic acidosis with a pH < 7.2 requires treatment; therefore, sodium bicarbonate is indicated. Management of AKI Fluid Management Strict I/O charting IV hydration (avoid Hypervolemia) Input I uids should be calculated as Urinary output + Insensible loss (loss from skin and breathing- 800 ml/day) IV is decided based on electrolytes Hypochloremia - Normal saline Normal chloride values - Ringer lactate Rhabdomyolysis - Sodium bicarbonate + Normal saline (Forced alkaline diuresis) Hypervolemia: 200 mg bolus Furosemide followed by 10 to 40 mg/hr in a drip +/- Thiazide diuretic Fluid restriction and increased salt intake in case of Hyponatremia Metabolic Acidosis Sodium Bicarbonate - 0.5×weight×(24 − actual value): Half dose stat and Half in divided doses over 24 hours. Overcorrection may lead to metabolic alkalosis, hypokalemia, hypocalcemia , and volume overload. Hyperkalemia Reduce dietary potassium intake. ACEi or ARBs are stopped as they contribute to hyperkalemia In case of moderate (6.1 to 7.0 mEq/L) to severe hyperkalemia (>7 mEq/L) IV Calcium gluconate IV insulin infusion with dextrose Salbutamol nebulization Hyperphosphatemia Reduce the dietary phosphate intake.

Explanation: The condition mentioned is a case of Tumor lysis syndrome , which is a rapid breakdown of tumor cells that releases intracellular contents into the bloodstream. This is most commonly seen in patients undergoing chemotherapy and presents with hyperuricemia, hyperkalemia, hyperphosphatemia , and hypocalcemia. It is ideally prevented by IV hydration and Allopurinol. Febuxostat is used when Allopurinol is contraindicated. Prevention approach of Tumor Lysis syndrome Low-risk Patients Regular monitoring of serum electrolytes Intermediate and High-risk patients- High baseline uric acid, High LDH, High WBC count, Large tumor size- >10 cm Maintain hydration with IV half normal saline or normal saline at 3000 mL/m²/day.

      "correct_answer": "D",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: D) Serum creatinine Explanation: CECT typically uses iodine-based contrast, which can significantly increase the risk of acute kidney injury or contrast-induced nephropathy , especially in patients with a history of kidney issues. Hence, a Kidney function test to evaluate serum creatinine and eGFR is important. The risk of AKI is minimal in patients with normal serum creatinine. Contrast-induced nephropathy Clinical progression Onset: Elevated serum creatinine can be observed 1 to 2 days after contrast administration. Peak Elevation: Typically reached within 3 to 5 days . Resolution: Usually begins within 1 week . High-risk groups Individuals with pre-existing renal disease Patients with multiple myeloma Diabetic patients, especially those with renal impairment Elderly patients and those with other comorbid conditions Prevention Hydration: Ensure adequate hydration before and after contrast administration. Kidney function evaluation: Perform serum creatinine tests prior to the procedure. Treatment Intravenous hydration (IV fluids to maintain renal perfusion) N-acetylcysteine (May offer protective effects on the kidneys) IV Sodium bicarbonate (Urine alkalinisation and renal protection) Urine analysis (Option A) does not specifically assess the risk of acute kidney injury (AKI) related to contrast media. It may only show changes after renal impairment has occurred, making it ineffective for pre-assessment. Serum electrolytes (Option B) can indicate imbalances but do not clearly assess renal function. They cannot determine the kidney's ability to excrete contrast agents and may only reflect changes after AKI has developed. Liver function tests (Option C) are not relevant for assessing the risk of contrast-induced nephropathy, as the clearance of contrast media occurs primarily through the kidneys.

      "explanation": "Correct Answer: D) Mismatched blood transfusion Explanation: The given scenario suggests Acute kidney injury (AKI) likely caused by exogenous nephrotoxins following prolonged entrapment. Mismatched blood transfusion primarily results in hemolytic reactions (Type 2 hypersensitivity) , which can lead to kidney injury indirectly through hemoglobinuria and tubular damage, but it is not categorized as a direct nephrotoxin. Chemotherapy-induced nephropathy (Option A) , ethylene glycol poisoning (Option B) , and contrast-induced nephropathy (Option C) are all recognized exogenous nephrotoxins that cause direct renal damage and acute kidney injury. Exogenous Nephrotoxins Contrast agents Iodinated contrast agents (CT) Gadolinium (MRI) Sodium phosphate solutions (bowel purgatives) Contrast-induced nephropathy (Option C) An increase in creatinine levels occurs within 1 to 2 days post-procedure, with peak levels reached by 3 to 5 days and typically resolves within a week. Treatment consists of IV fluids, sodium bicarbonate, and N-acetylcysteine. Drugs Vancomycin (Tubular injury) Amphotericin B (Hypokalemia, hypomagnesemia) Aminoglycosides (Non-oliguric kidney, i.e., urine output >400 mL/day) Acyclovir (Tubular obstruction) Some other drugs, like penicillins, cephalosporins, quinolones, sulfonamides, and rifampin, can also cause AKI. Chemotherapeutic agents (Option A) Cisplatin (mostly used in lung cancer) Carboplatin Toxic ingestions Ethylene glycol (Option B) An antifreeze agent found in automobiles can precipitate calcium oxalate crystals in the kidney tubules, leading to injury or obstruction and reduced urine output. The antidote is fomepizole . Diethylene glycol, often found as an adulterant in pharmaceutical products like cough syrups, can lead to metabolic acidosis, hyperkalemia, and anuria. Aristolochic acid is derived from contaminated medicinal herbs and agricultural practices, resulting in \"Chinese herb nephropathy\" and \"Balkan nephropathy.\" Melamine has been linked to contaminated foodstuffs, leading to nephrolithiasis and acute kidney injury (AKI).

BUN and creatinine are functional biomarkers of glomerular filtration rather than tissue injury biomarkers and, therefore, may be suboptimal for the diagnosis of actual parenchymal kidney damage. BUN and creatinine are also relatively slow to rise after kidney injury The novel biomarker KIM-1 (kidney injury molecule-1) is preferred for its high sensitivity and specificity in detecting acute tubular injury, particularly from cisplatin nephrotoxicity. Novel Biomarkers Description KIM-1 (Kidney injury molecule-1) (Option A) A type 1 transmembrane protein found in proximal tubular cells can be detected in urine and plasma following ischemic, nephrotoxic or chemotherapy-induced kidney injury (It is highly specific for cisplatin-induced tubular necrosis ). It can be measured in both blood and urine. NGAL (Neutrophil Gelatinase Associated Lipocalin) or Lipocalin-2 or Siderocalin (Option B) NGAL is a protein found in human neutrophil granules that binds iron siderophore complexes and provides tissue-protective effects in the proximal tubule. It can be detected in plasma and urine following inflammation and kidney injury. It is a good and sensitive marker but is less specific for tubular damage. It is very specific for cardio-pulmonary bypass-associated AKI SUPAR (Soluble Urokinase Plasminogen Activator Receptor) (Option C) A glycoprotein detected only in plasma and helps assess kidney health and injury.` Other tests: The following tests are being investigated as potential biomarkers for kidney injury: Insulin-like growth factor binding protein 7 (IGFBP7) Tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase-2 (TIMP-2) Cystatin-C (Option D) Osteopontin Clusterin These urinary and blood biomarkers facilitate the early and accurate diagnosis of AKI and help predict its prognosis.
