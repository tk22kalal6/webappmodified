      "question": "A 45-year-old woman presents with hyperthermia, tachycardia, and altered mental status following an abrupt discontinuation of her antithyroid medication. Upon examination, she is diaphoretic, has a goitre, and exhibits hand tremors. Which of the following is the DOC for managing her condition?",
      "options": {
        "A": "Administer Iodine solution",
        "B": "Administer a large dose of Propylthiouracil",
        "C": "Administer cholestyramine.",
        "D": "Administer Propranolol."
      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Correct answer: B) Administer a large dose of Propylthiouracil. Explanation: The patient is diagnosed with thyroid storm, an acute and life-threatening exacerbation of hyperthyroidism characterised by high fever, severe tachycardia, diaphoresis, hand tremors, and altered mental status. The abrupt discontinuation of her antithyroid medication likely triggered this crisis. The DOC for thyroid storm is Propylthiouracil, which reduces peripheral T4 to T3 conversion. Thyroid Storm Clinical Features Fever with diaphoresis. Cardiovascular Involvement: Tachycardia (>140 bpm), heart failure, arrhythmias, hypotension, and risk of cardiac arrest. CNS Manifestations: Agitation, delirium, anxiety, psychosis, or coma. Gastrointestinal Symptoms: Nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea, abdominal pain, intestinal obstruction, and acute hepatic failure. Management Initial Supportive Measures: IV fluids, oxygen, cooling blankets, and acetaminophen. Beta-blocker Therapy: Start with propranolol immediately (40-80 mg every 4-6 hours) to control adrenergic tone. DOC: Administer propylthiouracil (500-1000 mg loading, then 250 mg every 4 hours) or methimazole (20 mg every 4-6 hours). Iodine Solution: Give SSKI (5 drops every 6 hours) after thionamide to reduce the release of thyroid hormone Glucocorticoids: Hydrocortisone (100 mg IV every 8 hours) or dexamethasone (2 mg every 6 hours). Cholestyramine (Bile acid sequestrant) : 4 grams orally 4 times daily for severe cases to reduce enterohepatic recycling of thyroid hormone. Surgery: Thyroidectomy for patients with contraindications to thionamides after pre-treatment. Definitive Treatment: Recommend radioiodine therapy or surgery for hyperthyroidism once stabilised. Options A, C, and D are part of managing thyroid storm, but the DOC in this scenario is Propylthiouracil.

      "question": "A 32-year-old woman is scheduled for thyroidectomy. Her current thyroid function tests show decreased TSH level and elevated free T3 & T4. Which of the following is the most appropriate preoperative management to prevent thyroid storm?",
      "options": {
        "A": "Start propranolol alone one day before surgery",
        "B": "Start methimazole and wait for normal thyroid function tests",
        "C": "Start methimazole, potassium iodide, and propranolol 7-10 days before surgery",
        "D": "Proceed directly to surgery with close monitoring"
      },
      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Graves disease, it is essential to render the patient euthyroid preoperatively. Methimazole is started to inhibit thyroid hormone synthesis, and once hormone levels begin to fall (typically after a few days), potassium iodide is added 7–10 days before surgery to inhibit hormone release (the Wolff-Chaikoff effect) and reduce gland vascularity. Propranolol is used to control adrenergic symptoms and also slightly inhibits peripheral T4 to T3 conversion. The Burch-Wartofsky scoring system is used to help diagnose thyroid storm: Interpretation of Burch-Wartofsky score: ≥ 45 points: Highly suggestive of thyroid storm 25-44 points: Impending thyroid storm <25 points: Unlikely to represent thyroid storm Start propranolol alone one day before surgery (Option A): Propranolol only manages symptoms; it does not correct the underlying hormone excess or prevent thyroid hormone release during surgery. Start methimazole and wait for normal thyroid function tests (Option B): While methimazole is essential, waiting for complete normalization could take weeks to months and delay necessary surgery. Also, potassium iodide is needed preoperatively to reduce hormone release and gland vascularity. Proceed directly to surgery with close monitoring (Option D): Surgery in a thyrotoxic state greatly increases the risk of life-threatening thyroid storm. Preoperative preparation is essential.

      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Correct answer: B) Jod-Basedow effect Explanation: The patient shows features of hyperthyroidism, which occurred after receiving iodinated contrast during a CT angiogram. This Iodine-induced hyperthyroidism is called the Jod-Basedow effect, which occurs due to increased iodine trapping leading to Increased T4, T3 production. Wolff Chaikoff effect & Jod Basedow effect Feature Wolff-Chaikoff Effect Jod-Basedow Effect Definition Temporary inhibition of thyroid hormone synthesis in response to high iodine exposure Iodine-induced hyperthyroidism Mechanism High iodine levels inhibit thyroid peroxidase, reducing T3 and T4 production Excess iodine stimulates autonomous thyroid hormone production in susceptible individuals Duration Temporary (usually resolves in 1-2 weeks) Can persist until treated Thyroid Function Tests Initially decreased T3 and T4, increased TSH Increased T3 and T4, decreased TSH At-risk Population Normal thyroid glands Pre-existing thyroid disease (e.g., multinodular goiter, Graves' disease) Clinical Presentation Usually asymptomatic or mild hypothyroid symptoms Symptoms of hyperthyroidism (e.g., palpitations, heat intolerance, weight loss) Hashitoxicosis (Option D): This refers to transient hyperthyroidism caused by the release of preformed thyroid hormones during the early inflammatory phase of Hashimoto thyroiditis.

      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: C) Subacute thyroiditis Here, thyroid scan / RAIU scan shows very low uptake, indicating thyroid gland is not active, but free T4 and T3 are elevated due to inflammation of the thyroid gland indicating thyroiditis as a cause of this patient's condition. Subacute thyroiditis (de Quervain thyroiditis) is an immune reaction of thyroid gland (tender thyroid gland ) that follows an upper respiratory tract infection (viral infections). From the given options, Subacute thyroiditis is one of the causes for thyrotoxicosis without hyperthyroidism. During the thyrotoxic phase of Subacute thyroiditis , there is a transient release of stored thyroid hormones (T3 and T4) into the bloodstream due to the inflammation of thyroid tissue. The thyrotoxic phase usually lasts for several weeks, followed by a hypothyroid phase and eventual recovery. Causes of thyrotoxicosis without hyperthyroidism include: Subacute thyroiditis Silent thyroiditis Factitious thyrotoxicosis Radiation/Amiodarone/Infarction of a large tumour The other options (Options A, B, D) cause thyrotoxicosis due to hyperthyroidism, meaning the thyroid gland is actively overproducing thyroid hormones (high uptake on RAIU scan).",

The diagnosis is supported by: Young age (typically affects women between 20-50 years) Symptoms of hyperthyroidism (weight loss, palpitations, heat intolerance) Diffuse goitre on examination Presence of ophthalmopathy Suppressed TSH with elevated free T4 and free T3 Causes of Primary and Secondary Hyperthyroidism Cause Key Features for identification Primary Hyperthyroidism (pathology within the thyroid gland) Graves' disease Diffuse goitre, ophthalmopathy, TSH receptor antibodies (LATS- long-acting thyroid stimulating antibodies) Toxic multinodular goiter Multiple autonomous nodules, older patients Toxic adenoma Single autonomous nodule Subacute thyroiditis (de Quervain thyroiditis) Painful thyroid, recent viral illness, transient Silent thyroiditis (Painless lymphocytic thyroiditis) Painless, often postpartum, transient Iodine-induced thyrotoxicosis History of iodine exposure (e.g., contrast, amiodarone) Drug-induced (e.g., amiodarone) History of relevant medication use Secondary Hyperthyroidism TSH-secreting pituitary adenoma Inappropriate TSH secretion, other pituitary hormones may be affected hCG-mediated hyperthyroidism Pregnancy, gestational trophoblastic disease (Alpha subunit of hCG is similar in structure to TSH) Thyroid hormone resistance (rare) Genetic disorder, reduced sensitivity of the body to thyroid hormone. Ectopic Hyperthyroidism Struma ovarii Ovarian teratoma with functional thyroid tissue Toxic multinodular goiter (Option A): Typically occurs in older individuals with a nodular goiter, not a diffuse one like this patient. TSH-secreting pituitary adenoma (Option C): Would show elevated TSH, whereas this patient has suppressed TSH. Iodine-induced thyrotoxicosis (Option D): Requires recent iodine exposure, which is not mentioned in this case.

      "explanation": "Correct answer: D) T3 thyrotoxicosis The patient's clinical presentation suggests T3 thyrotoxicosis , which is supported by the suppressed TSH, normal Free T4 and increased Free T3 level. T3 thyrotoxicosis occurs due to increased peripheral Deiodinase enzyme activity, which converts free T4 to free T3. Thyroid Function Test interpretation: Condition TSH Free T4 Free T3 Primary hypothyroidism ↑ ↓ ↓ Primary hyperthyroidism ↓ (<0.1 mIU/L) ↑ ↑ Subclinical hypothyroidism ↑ Normal Normal Subclinical hyperthyroidism ↓ Normal Normal Secondary hypothyroidism ↓ or approximately normal ↓ ↓ T3 thyrotoxicosis ↓ Normal ↑ Euthyroid sick syndrome Normal Normal ↓ Additional Tests for Aetiology: Anti-TPO (thyroid peroxidase) antibodies: Positive in Hashimoto's thyroiditis.

      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: B) Graves' disease In Graves' disease, there is diffusely increased uptake of radioactive iodine throughout an enlarged gland , often described as a \" hot \" appearance. Thyroid scan: Thyroid scans use radioactive iodine (I-123) or technetium-99m to assess thyroid function and structure on RAIU scans. Increased uptake indicates hyperfunction, while decreased uptake suggests hypofunction or thyroiditis. The pattern of uptake helps differentiate between diffuse (Graves') and nodular (toxic adenoma, multinodular) causes of hyperthyroidism. Thyroid scans are useful when TSH is suppressed to determine the cause of hyperthyroidism. Interpretation: Normal Thyroid : Uniform uptake throughout the gland. Graves' Disease : Diffusely increased uptake throughout an enlarged gland. Toxic Multinodular Goiter : Multiple areas of increased and decreased uptake. (Option A) Toxic Adenoma : Single area of increased uptake with suppression of surrounding tissue. (Option D) Thyroiditis : Very low or no uptake due to inflammation and destruction of thyroid tissue. (Option C) Thyroid Cancer : Usually appears as \"cold\" nodules (areas of decreased uptake).",

        "D": "MRI Brain"
      },
      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "appropriate initial management is to start antithyroid medication (carbimazole) along with a beta-blocker (propranolol) to control symptoms. Management: Antithyroid drugs (ATDs): First-line treatment, especially in younger patients. Carbimazole or methimazole is preferred over propylthiouracil due to the lower risk of hepatotoxicity. Radioactive iodine (RAI) ablation: It is used in older patients, those with recurrent disease after antithyroid drugs, or those with contraindications to antithyroid medications. It's contraindicated in pregnancy and can worsen ophthalmopathy, especially in smokers. (Option A) Surgery (total thyroidectomy): Surgery is reserved for patients with large goitres, those who have failed medical therapy, or when there's a need for rapid control of hyperthyroidism. It's not the first-line treatment due to potential surgical complications and the need for lifelong thyroid hormone replacement. (Option B) Beta-blockers: Beta-blockers like propranolol are used to control adrenergic symptoms until the patient becomes euthyroid with ATDs. MRI brain (Option D): MRI of the brain is done when the TSH levels are elevated along with the Free T3 & T4 levels. It helps diagnose Pituitary adenoma which can lead to secondary hyperthyroidism. Secondary Hyperthyroidism: Secondary hyperthyroidism refers to excessive thyroid hormone production due to extrathyroidal causes. Causes with Treatment: TSH-secreting pituitary adenoma: First-line: Transsphenoidal surgery to remove the adenoma If surgery is contraindicated or unsuccessful: Somatostatin analogs (e.g., octreotide, lanreotide) to suppress TSH secretion Dopamine agonists (e.g., cabergoline) may be effective in some cases Radiation therapy for residual tumor Pituitary resistance to thyroid hormone: Beta-blockers to manage symptoms Treatment to manage any associated pituitary abnormalities hCG-secreting tumors: Treatment of the underlying tumor (e.g., choriocarcinoma, hydatidiform mole) In all cases, beta-blockers may be used to manage symptoms of thyrotoxicosis until definitive treatment takes effect. Antithyroid drugs are generally not effective in secondary hyperthyroidism as they do not address the underlying cause of excessive TSH production.

      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "(myxedema) , points to hypothyroidism. In hypothyroidism, there is an accumulation of glycosaminoglycans (e.g., hyaluronic acid) in the dermis. This substance binds water, leading to non-pitting edema and the characteristic \"puffy\" appearance, particularly around the eyes. The yellowish tinge to the skin may be due to carotenemia, common in hypothyroidism due to reduced conversion of carotene to vitamin A. The dry skin is a hallmark of decreased thyroid function, which reduces sebaceous and sweat gland activity. The non-pitting edema seen in this patient is due to glycosaminoglycan accumulation, which causes fluid retention but lacks the pitting typically seen in other forms of edema. Increased dermal collagen deposition (Option A): Glycosaminoglycans are the cause of skin changes in hypothyroidism and not collagen. Hyperpigmentation due to adrenal insufficiency (Option C): Pallor and yellow tinge are due to carotene accumulation, not hyperpigmentation. Cutaneous manifestations of liver disease (Option D): While liver disease can cause yellowing of the skin (jaundice), the combination of symptoms and skin changes described is more consistent with hypothyroidism. The yellow tinge in this case is attributed to carotene accumulation, not bilirubin. Reference: Harrison’s Principles of Internal Medicine, 21st Edition, Volume I, Page 2935",

Intravenous T3 (liothyronine) is preferred initially because: It has a faster onset of action compared to T4 (levothyroxine) In severe hypothyroidism, peripheral conversion of T4 to T3 may be impaired Myxedema coma Precipitating Factors - Infection - Cold exposure - Trauma - Medications (sedatives, anaesthetics) - Discontinuation of thyroid hormone Diagnosis - Clinical presentation - Elevated TSH, low Free T4 - Associated lab abnormalities (hyponatremia, hypoglycemia, hypercapnia) Initial Management 1. Intravenous T3 (liothyronine): 10-20 µ g bolus, then 10 µ g q8h 2. Intravenous levothyroxine: 300-500 µ g loading dose 3. Hydrocortisone: 100 mg q8h (for potential adrenal insufficiency) 4. Supportive care: Mechanical ventilation if needed, cautious rewarming, fluid resuscitation with Hypertonic saline Option A & C: Oral administration is not reliable in myxedema coma due to poor GI absorption, and T4 alone has a slower onset. Supportive care only and repeat thyroid function tests in 24 hours (Option D): Delaying treatment in myxedema coma can be fatal, as there is a 20–40% mortality rate, despite intensive treatment. Thyroid hormone replacement must be initiated immediately along with supportive care (warming, fluids, and often corticosteroids).

On day 3 of his admission, routine blood tests reveal the following thyroid function results: TSH: 0.6 mIU/L (normal range: 0.4-4.0 mIU/L) Free T4: 12 pmol/L (normal range: 10-20 pmol/L) Free T3: 2.1 pmol/L (normal range: 3.5-6.5 pmol/L) The patient has no history of thyroid disease.

      "explanation": "monitoring. Correct Answer: D) No specific thyroid treatment; continue to manage underlying sepsis with TFT monitoring. The patient's thyroid function tests show a pattern typical of sick euthyroid syndrome: Low free T3 Normal free T4 Normal TSH The most appropriate management is to continue treating the underlying illness (sepsis) without specific thyroid treatment and TFT monitoring. Sick Euthyroid Syndrome Definition Abnormal thyroid function tests in critically ill patients without underlying thyroid disease Common Causes - Severe illness (e.g., sepsis, myocardial infarction) - Major surgery - Trauma - Starvation Typical Laboratory Findings - Low free T3 (most common) - Normal free T4 - Normal TSH Pathophysiology - Decreased peripheral conversion of T4 to T3 - Increased reverse T3 (rT3) Start levothyroxine replacement therapy (Option A): Levothyroxine replacement is not indicated in sick euthyroid syndrome. Start liothyronine (T3) replacement therapy (Option B): Liothyronine (T3) replacement is not recommended and may be harmful. Start propylthiouracil to treat subclinical hyperthyroidism (Option C): Propylthiouracil is used to treat hyperthyroidism, which is not present here.

Methimazole (Option B) is effective for managing hyperthyroidism, but it is not preferred during the first trimester as it is associated with a higher risk of congenital malformations (such as aplasia cutis) if used during the early stages of pregnancy. PTU is replaced with Methimazole during the 2nd and 3rd trimesters due to the risk of hepatotoxicity in prolonged use. Radioactive iodine (Option C) is contraindicated during pregnancy due to its potential to damage the fetal thyroid and cause permanent hypothyroidism. Levothyroxine (Option D) is used to treat hypothyroidism, not hyperthyroidism, in Graves' disease. Reference: Harrison’s Principles of Internal Medicine, 21st Edition, Volume I, Page 2938.",

      "explanation": "Additionally, pregnancy increases the levels of thyroid-binding globulin (TBG), which decreases the amount of free thyroid hormones available. As a result, women with hypothyroidism require an increase in levothyroxine dose to maintain normal thyroid function. Frequent monitoring of thyroid function is important to adjust the dose as needed throughout the pregnancy.
