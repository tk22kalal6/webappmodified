The parents report that the child has been experiencing these seizures since early childhood. Which of the following syndromes is NOT associated with myoclonic seizures?",
      "options": {
        "A": "JANZ Syndrome",
        "B": "Lennox-Gastaut Syndrome",
        "C": "Progressive Myoclonic Epilepsies",
        "D": "None of the above"
      },
      "correct_answer": "D",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: D) None of the above Explanation: All the listed syndromes (JANZ Syndrome(JME), Lennox-Gastaut Syndrome, and PME) are associated with myoclonic seizures. Therefore, the correct choice indicates that none of them can be excluded from having myoclonic seizure presentations. Myoclonic Seizures Myoclonus is a sudden and brief muscle contraction that can involve one part of the body or the entire body. Physiologic Myoclonus: A common form is the sudden jerking movement observed while falling asleep. Pathologic Myoclonus: Often associated with metabolic disorders, degenerative CNS diseases, or anoxic brain injury. Myoclonic seizures are considered true epileptic events due to cortical dysfunction. EEG Findings: Shows bilaterally synchronous spike-and-slow-wave discharges immediately before the movement, along with muscle artefact during myoclonus. Myoclonic seizures often coexist with other forms of generalized seizures. Juvenile Myoclonic Epilepsy (JME): (Option A ruled out) Myoclonus is a predominant feature of juvenile myoclonic epilepsy (JME). Begins around puberty or early adulthood. Seizures often occur soon after waking up involving the neck, shoulders, and upper arms. Lennox-Gastaut Syndrome: (Option B ruled out) An uncommon syndrome that includes multiple seizure types. Begins in early childhood. Myoclonic seizures involve the neck, shoulders, upper arms, and often the face. Progressive Myoclonic Epilepsies (PME): (Option C ruled out) Features a combination of myoclonic seizures and tonic-clonic seizures. Treatment is usually not successful for long and patients may deteriorate over time. Often develop intellectual disability, coordination, and walking problems.

        "D": "Diazepam"
      },
      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: C) Lorazepam Explanation The scenario describes a seizure lasting 6 minutes with impaired consciousness during the interictal period, indicating Status Epilepticus . The drug of choice for treatment in this case is IV lorazepam. Status epilepticus refers to either continuous seizures ( ≥ 5 minutes) or recurrent ( ≥ 2), discrete seizures with impaired consciousness between episodes (interictal period). Types Generalized convulsive status epilepticus (GCSE) GCSE is an emergency and must be treated immediately (e.g., persistent, generalized electrographic seizures, coma, and tonic-clonic movements). Nonconvulsive status epilepticus (NCSE) E.g., persistent absence seizures or focal seizures with confusion or partially impaired consciousness, and minimal motor abnormalities. Management: Valproate (Option A) is the drug of choice for several types of epilepsy, including generalized tonic-clonic seizures (GTCS), atypical absence seizures, Dravet’s syndrome, juvenile myoclonic epilepsy, and in cases of atypical absence seizures when ethosuximide is not prescribed. Levetiracetam (Option B) is considered the safest option and the drug of choice for treating epilepsy during pregnancy. Diazepam (Option D) is the drug of choice for febrile seizures, with the preferred route being rectal. It is used for both treatment and prevention.",

      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: B) Sturge-Weber Syndrome Explanation: The combination of a port-wine stain in the trigeminal distribution, seizures, unilateral weakness, and tram-track calcifications aligns perfectly with the clinical features of Sturge-Weber syndrome. Sturge-Weber Syndrome: It is a neurocutaneous disorder characterized by vascular malformations affecting the skin, brain, and eyes Port-wine stain (cutaneous manifestation) – Usually located in the trigeminal nerve distribution on the face. Cavernous hemangioma – May also affect intraoral structures like the lip, coexisting with the facial port-wine stain. Clinical features: STURGE S : Seizures – Caused by cavernous angiomas in the brain, often leading to epilepsy. T : Tram-track gyriform calcifications – Visible calcifications on brain imaging, seen in areas of abnormal blood vessel growth. U : Unilateral weakness – Hemiparesis (weakness on one side of the body) opposite the facial port-wine stain. R : Reduced intellect – Intellectual disability is frequently observed. G : Glaucoma – Increased intraocular pressure, which may cause buphthalmos (enlargement of the eye). E : Epilepsy – Seizures are common due to underlying brain malformations. Tram track appearance on CT Head Port wine stain Neurofibromatosis Type 1 (Option A) : This condition is characterized by café-au-lait spots, neurofibromas, and Lisch nodules, rather than port-wine stains and tram-track calcifications, making it an unlikely diagnosis. Tuberous Sclerosis (Option C) : This disorder typically presents with skin findings like angiofibromas, shagreen patches, and renal angiomyolipomas, not with port-wine stains or tram-track calcifications. Hypoparathyroidism (Option D) : This condition primarily affects calcium metabolism and is not associated with the neurological or cutaneous features described, making it irrelevant to this clinical scenario.",

      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "measles antibody titers Correct Answer: C) Characteristic EEG findings, elevated CSF globulin levels, and elevated CSF measles antibody titers Explanation: This option accurately reflects the diagnostic criteria for SSPE, which requires three of five specific criteria to confirm the diagnosis. The combination of characteristic EEG findings, elevated CSF globulin, and elevated CSF measles antibody levels provides strong evidence for SSPE. Subacute Sclerosing Panencephalitis (SSPE): Diagnosis: MRI : Often normal early; later stages show increased T2 signal in the white matter of the brain and brainstem. EEG : Initially shows nonspecific slowing, progressing to a characteristic periodic pattern with bursts of high-voltage sharp, slow waves every 3–8 seconds, followed by attenuated \"flat\" background. CSF findings : Acellular, with normal or mildly elevated protein; significantly elevated gamma globulin (>20% of total protein); elevated antimeasles antibody levels and presence of oligoclonal antimeasles antibodies. Brain biopsy : Measles virus can be cultured from brain tissue; viral antigen identified via immunocytochemistry or viral genome via PCR. Serum : Persistent measles-specific IgG in serum and CSF. Diagnostic Criteria: (Options A & B ruled out) SSPE can be diagnosed if three out of five criteria are met: Typical clinical presentation (progressive neurologic deterioration). EEG showing stereotyped periodic complexes. Brain biopsy or autopsy with characteristic histopathological findings. CSF globulin levels greater than 20% of total CSF protein. Elevated CSF measles antibody titers ( ≥ 1/4 by hemagglutination inhibition or ≥ 1/20 by ELISA). Management: No definitive therapy is available. Isoprinosine (Inosiplex, 100 mg/kg/day) , either alone or combined with intrathecal or intraventricular interferon- α , may prolong survival and provide clinical improvement , though this is not confirmed by controlled trials. Prognosis : Antiviral therapy is ineffective, and death typically occurs within a few years. Increased T2 signal on MRI, acellular CSF, and elevated serum measles-specific IgG (Option D) : While increased T2 signal on MRI can be seen in SSPE, acellular CSF is not characteristic of SSPE. Moreover, elevated serum measles-specific IgG does not provide the necessary diagnostic support without fulfilling the criteria related to CSF findings.

      "question": "A 10 y/o boy presents to the clinic with a year-long history of cognitive decline. His parents report increased irritability, social withdrawal, and difficulty in school.

      },
      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: A) Subacute sclerosing panencephalitis Explanation: SSPE is a rare, progressive neurological disorder that occurs 6-8 years after a measles infection. It is characterized by cognitive decline, personality changes, irritability, myoclonus, and motor difficulties, aligning with the patient's symptoms and history of measles. Subacute Sclerosing Panencephalitis (SSPE) About SSPE is a rare, severe complication of the measles virus. It typically presents in early adolescence and has a progressive course with high mortality. Vaccination has reduced measles cases, but SSPE remains a concern due to measles re-emergence. Pathophysiology Caused by the measles virus , which is highly contagious and transmitted via aerosols. The latency period ranges from 6-8 years post-infection , with shorter periods in younger children. The virus targets lymphocytes and epithelial cells , causing significant immunosuppression. SSPE is associated with a poor cellular immune response and persistent viral presence in the CNS. Neuronal entry and infection mechanisms are not fully understood; mutations in the virus may facilitate evasion of the immune response. Clinical Features Symptoms typically arise 6-8 years after measles infection, starting with cognitive decline. Early signs include personality changes, poor school performance, and lethargy. Stage I : Personality and behavioural changes, including irritability, dementia, lethargy, social withdrawal, and speech regression. Stage II : Progressive decline in motor function characterized by myoclonus, dyskinesia, and dystonia. Stage III : Development of extrapyramidal symptoms, posturing, and spasticity. Stage IV : Akinetic mutism, autonomic failure, or transition to a vegetative state. Progressive motor function decline occurs, with myoclonus and focal paralysis. Patients may develop seizures , leading to vegetative states or akinetic mutism. Visual symptoms may precede other signs, including retinal lesions and vision loss. Atypical presentations can involve psychiatric symptoms and rapid decline, especially in younger patients. Dravet’s syndrome (Option B) is a severe form of epilepsy that usually presents in infancy with prolonged seizures and is often associated with developmental delays. While it involves cognitive decline and seizures, the onset is typically much earlier, and there’s no prior history of measles infection that would suggest SSPE. Landau-Kleffner syndrome (Option C) is characterized by the loss of language skills and seizures in children, typically occurring between ages 3 and 7. While it includes cognitive decline, it does not align with the patient’s history of measles or the specific symptoms of myoclonus. Juvenile myoclonic epilepsy (Option D) usually presents in adolescence with myoclonic jerks and generalized tonic-clonic seizures. It doesn't typically involve a history of measles or the specific progressive cognitive decline noted in this patient.

      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: B) Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease Explanation: The progression from localized frontal intermittent rhythmical delta activity (FIRDA) to PSWC is characteristic of Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD), along with the patient's rapid cognitive decline and myoclonus. Periodic sharp wave complexes (PSWC) The first EEG finding in Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD) is often localized frontal intermittent rhythmical delta activity (FIRDA). FIRDA evolves to typical periodic sharp wave complexes (PSWC) after a few weeks. PSWC is characterized by generalized synchronized high-voltage sharp waves with frequencies of 1–2 Hz. While PSWC usually appear generalized, they may exhibit lateralized or localized distributions in the early stages of CJD. PSWC is one of the criteria for the clinical diagnosis of CJD. Hence, Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD) presents with PSWC and myoclonic jerks. Periodic sharp wave complexes are seen on EEG Triphasic waves Triphasic waves are abnormal EEG waveforms characterized by high-amplitude sharp waves with three distinctive phases. They are seen in association with multiple clinical conditions, including encephalopathy, structural brain lesions etc. Duration: 300 to 600 milliseconds. Phases: First phase (negative), second phase (positive, amplitude >70 microvolts), third phase (slow negative). Frequency: Periodic, at a rate of 0.5 Hz to 2 Hz. Distribution: Diffuse with synchronous bifrontal and central predominance, showing fronto-occipital time lag. Causes: Encephalopathy: Hepatic, Renal and Metabolic (e.g., hypernatremia, hyponatremia, hypoglycemia) Structural Abnormalities: Cerebral abscess Thalamic gliomas Pontine stroke Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD) Alzheimer's disease Other Conditions: Ictal or postictal states Serotonin syndrome Lithium toxicity Antibiotic toxicity (e.g., cefepime) Hepatic and renal encephalopathy (Options A & C) may cause altered mental status, but not the rapid cognitive decline, myoclonus, and specific EEG findings seen in CJD. Alzheimer’s disease (Option D) typically has a much slower progression and lacks these EEG patterns and associated myoclonus.",

      "options": {
        "A": "Benign Rolandic epilepsy",
        "B": "Subtle seizure",
        "C": "Febrile seizures",
        "D": "Myoclonic seizures"
      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: B) Subtle seizure Explanation: Subtle seizures are the most common seizure type in newborns , often presenting with changes in tone or subtle movements that often go unnoticed. These seizures mimic normal behaviours and reactions, making them easily overlooked. Types of Movements: Ocular Movements: Includes random eye movements, sustained conjugate tonic deviation, eyelid blinking or fluttering, eye-rolling, and nystagmus. Oral-Buccal-Lingual Movements: Such as sucking, smacking, chewing, and tongue protrusions. Progressive Movements: Including rowing, swimming, pedalling, thrashing, or struggling movements. Complex Purposeless Movements: Characterized by sudden arousal, episodic limb hyperactivity, and crying. Benign rolandic epilepsy (Option A) is the most common type of epilepsy in children. It's also known as benign epilepsy with centrotemporal spikes (BECTS). Symptoms- Twitching, numbness, or tingling in the face or tongue, which can cause garbled speech. Occur most often at night, or when falling asleep or waking up. It usually lasts up to two minutes. Seizures typically stop by the time a child is 19 years old. Some children with BRE have problems with learning, speech, or behavioural issues. In most cases, children with BRE don't need medication because the seizures aren't a big problem. Most children stop having seizures within 2 to 4 years after they begin. Febrile seizures (Option C) are the most common type of epilepsy in infants and young children aged 6 months to 5 years, with a peak incidence between 12 and 18 months. They are associated with febrile illnesses but have no identifiable cause, such as CNS infection or metabolic issues. Simple FS: Lasts less than 15 minutes, typically associated with common infections. High risk of developing temporal lobe epilepsy. Complex FS: Involves multiple seizures during a single febrile illness, lasting 15-30 minutes. Febrile Status Epilepticus (FSE): Seizures lasting over 30 minutes, accounting for 25-52% of status epilepticus cases in children. A higher risk of FSE is noted in children with underlying neurological disorders. Myoclonic seizures (Option D) are less common than subtle seizures. They are rapid, single, or rhythmic repetitive jerks that involve a finger, limb, or the entire body. They are more common in pre-term infants than term infants. It may resemble the Moro reflex and startling responses. It is associated with severe brain damage.

        "D": "Stop all antiseizure medications while trying to conceive."
      },
      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "oral contraceptives. Correct Answer: C) Consider alternative contraception methods due to carbamazepine's effect on oral contraceptives. Explanation: Carbamazepine can significantly reduce the effectiveness of oral contraceptives, so alternative methods (like IUDs) are recommended for women not planning to conceive. Catamenial Epilepsy Increased seizure frequency around menses due to estrogen/progesterone effects or antiseizure drug level changes. Some women may require increased antiseizure drug dosages during menses. Natural progestins or intramuscular medroxyprogesterone may benefit certain women. Pregnancy ~50% of women experience unchanged seizure frequency; ~30% may increase, and ~20% decrease. Monitoring of serum antiseizure drug levels is essential during pregnancy. Lamotrigine and levetiracetam are recommended as first-line monotherapy for generalized and focal onset seizures. The higher teratogenic risk with multiple antiseizure drugs is noted. Valproic acid is strongly associated with adverse fetal outcomes and is thus contraindicated in pregnancy. Folate supplementation (1–4 mg/d) is recommended due to antifolate effects of anticonvulsants. Enzyme-inducing drugs (phenytoin, carbamazepine, oxcarbazepine, topiramate, phenobarbital, primidone) may cause vitamin K deficiency in newborns. Hence mothers should take oral vitamin K, and infants should receive intramuscular vitamin K at birth. Contraception Certain antiseizure medications (carbamazepine, phenytoin, phenobarbital, topiramate) reduce oral contraceptive efficacy via enzyme induction. Alternative contraception methods (IUDs, long-acting reversible contraceptives) should be considered. Breast-Feeding Antiseizure medications are excreted in breast milk at varying levels (5% for valproic acid to 300% for levetiracetam). Encouraged to breastfeed unless infant shows signs of drug effects (e.g., lethargy, poor feeding). Continue carbamazepine without changes (Option A): Carbamazepine reduces oral contraceptive efficacy, requiring adjustments. Switch to phenytoin for better control (Option B): Phenytoin also interacts with contraceptives and has teratogenic risks. Stop all antiseizure medications while trying to conceive (Option D): Uncontrolled seizures pose risks, so effective seizure control should be maintained.

Explanation: In the case of GTCS, The EEG during the tonic phase shows a progressive increase in generalized low-voltage fast activity. Focal Seizure- EEG GTCS- EEG The routine interictal EEG in patients with focal seizures is often normal. (Option A ruled out) It may show brief discharges, such as epileptiform spikes or sharp waves. Focal seizures can arise from areas like the medial temporal lobe or inferior frontal lobe, which may be distant from the scalp. As a result, the EEG recorded during the seizure may be nonlocalizing. The region of seizure onset can be identified using surgically placed intracranial electrodes. During the tonic phase , the EEG shows a progressive increase in generalized low-voltage fast activity. (Option B) This is followed by generalized high-amplitude polyspike discharges. In the clonic phase , high-amplitude activity is typically interrupted by slow waves, creating a spike-and-slow-wave pattern.

      "explanation": "Correct Answer : B) Vasovagal Syncope Explanation: The patient’s premonitory symptoms (dizziness, sweating, nausea), environmental triggers (hot, crowded room), brief loss of consciousness, and rapid recovery without postictal confusion are characteristic of vasovagal syncope. Vasovagal Syncope vs. Generalized Tonic-Clonic Seizures (GTCS) : Features Vasovagal Syncope (Neurally Mediated Syncope) Generalized Tonic-Clonic Seizures (GTCS) Cause It results from a reflex that alters autonomic outflow, leading to bradycardia, vasodilation, and reduced cardiac output. This lowers systemic blood pressure and causes cerebral hypoperfusion, leading to syncope. GTCS are caused by widespread abnormal electrical activity in the brain, leading to both tonic (stiffening) and clonic (jerking) muscle contractions. Triggers Emotional stress, pain, standing upright for long periods, warm environments, dehydration, blood loss, and sight of blood. GTCS can occur without clear triggers. Pathophysiology Increased parasympathetic outflow (vagal activation) and inhibition of sympathetic outflow result in bradycardia and hypotension. Cerebral blood flow falls below compensatory limits, causing loss of consciousness. Seizures begin abruptly, often without warning. The tonic phase involves sustained muscle contraction, leading to symptoms like the \"ictal cry\" due to vocal cord contraction. The clonic phase features rhythmic jerking as muscles relax intermittently. Symptoms Premonitory : Dizziness, lightheadedness, nausea, yawning, sweating, pallor, and palpitations. During the event : Transient loss of consciousness, uprolling of the eyes, dilated pupils, possible muscle jerks (myoclonus), and rarely, urinary or faecal incontinence. EEG pattern : \"Slow-flat-slow\" pattern with high-amplitude slow waves, followed by EEG flattening. Premonitory : Some patients have vague premonitory symptoms, but stereotypical auras are rare. During the event : Tonic contraction followed by clonic jerking. The patient may experience cyanosis, tongue biting, loss of bladder/bowel control, and increased heart rate and blood pressure. Postictal : Period of confusion lasting minutes to hours, fatigue, headache, muscle soreness, and incontinence. Postictal confusion is a prominent feature. EEG pattern : Low-voltage fast activity during the tonic phase, followed by a spike-and-slow-wave pattern during the clonic phase. Postictal suppression of brain activity is observed. Recovery Quick recovery of consciousness without prolonged confusion. Postictal confusion and hallucinations are rare. GTCS has a prolonged postictal phase with confusion and fatigue. Generalized Tonic-Clonic Seizure (GTCS) (Option A) : Unlikely, as GTCS usually involves tonic-clonic movements and prolonged postictal confusion, neither of which occurred. Cardiac Arrhythmia (Option C) : Less likely, as arrhythmias often lack clear premonitory symptoms like dizziness or nausea, and recovery may not be as immediate. Hypoglycemia (Option D) : Unlikely, as hypoglycemia often presents with hunger, sweating, and confusion, but without a clear environmental trigger like standing in a hot room.",

      "explanation": "Correct Answer: C) Epileptic spasms Explanation: The clinical description of brief, sustained flexion, age group (infants), and EEG showing hypsarrhythmia with background suppression are classic for epileptic spasms. Epileptic spasms: Definition : Epileptic spasms are characterized by brief, sustained flexion or extension of mainly proximal muscles, including the trunk. Also known as Salaam convulsions . Age Group : Predominantly occurs in infants, likely due to differences in neuronal function and connectivity in the immature CNS. EEG Features : Shows hypsarrhythmia, marked by diffuse giant slow waves with a chaotic background of irregular , multifocal spikes and sharp waves. Clinical Spasm EEG : During a spasm, the EEG shows significant background suppression, known as the \"electrodecremental response.\" EMG Characteristics : Reveals a rhomboid pattern, distinguishing it from brief tonic and myoclonic seizures. Absence seizures (Option A) : Absence seizures are generalized seizures characterized by brief lapses in consciousness without the tonic or flexor posturing, and no hypsarrhythmia pattern on EEG. Myoclonic seizures (Option B) : Myoclonic seizures are brief, sudden jerks without sustained flexion/extension or characteristic EEG changes (hypsarrhythmia or electrodecremental response). Lennox-Gastaut syndrome (Option D) : Though this syndrome also occurs in children and involves multiple seizure types, it does not typically present with hypsarrhythmia or spasms as seen here.

      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: C) Variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease (vCJD) Explanation: The diagnosis is most likely “ Variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease (vCJD)”, due to the patient’s history of consuming poor-quality beef, which is associated with prion diseases like vCJD, a known cause of myoclonus. Myoclonic Seizures : Definition : Sudden, brief muscle contractions that can involve a part of or the entire body. Physiological Example : Normal myoclonus occurs as a sudden jerk when falling asleep. Pathological Causes : Most commonly seen in metabolic disorders, degenerative CNS diseases, or anoxic brain injury. VCJD -Variant Creutzfeldt Jakob Disease: Patient has a history of consumption of poor-quality beef. It may contain Prion particles, which, on entering the body, multiply in the cytoplasm of neurons. It irritates neurons, leading to their abnormal firing. Aetiology : Myoclonic seizures are epileptic events caused by cortical dysfunction, as opposed to subcortical or spinal causes. EEG Findings : Shows bilaterally synchronous spike-and-slow-wave discharges just before the myoclonic jerk, with muscle artefact. Association with Other Seizures : Myoclonic seizures often occur alongside other generalized seizures. They are the hallmark feature of juvenile myoclonic epilepsy (JME). Epileptic spasms (Option A) typically occur in infants and present with different EEG findings (hypsarrhythmia) rather than spike-and-slow-wave discharges. Juvenile Myoclonic Epilepsy (Option B) : Although JME can cause myoclonic seizures and spike-and-slow-wave discharges, the history of beef consumption strongly suggests prion disease. Anoxic brain injury (Option D) : There's no evidence of hypoxia or brain injury, and the patient’s symptoms are better explained by prion-related vCJD.

Generalized Onset Seizures: Arise from a point in the brain but quickly engage both cerebral hemispheres. Classified into types based on distinct clinical features. Typical Absence Seizures (Option A) Atypical Absence Seizures (Option B ruled out) Characteristics: Sudden, brief lapses of consciousness without postural control loss, lasting seconds. Motor Signs: Subtle, bilateral motor signs such as eyelid blinking, chewing, or small clonic hand movements. Onset: Common in children (ages 4–10) or early adolescence, occurring hundreds of times a day. Clinical Presentation: May appear as \"daydreaming\" and poor school performance, often misdiagnosed as attention deficit disorder. EEG Findings: Generalized 3-Hz spike-and-slow-wave discharges. Provoked By: Hyperventilation may induce seizures and EEG discharges. Treatment: Valproate (drug of choice) Valproate-associated fulminant hepatic failure (younger the age, higher the risk) Ethosuximide is used (especially in <2 years). Characteristics: Longer, less abrupt lapses of consciousness with more noticeable motor signs. EEG Findings: Slower (<2.5 Hz) generalized spike-and-slow-wave discharges, plus other abnormalities. Association: Linked to structural brain abnormalities and often co-occurs with mental retardation or neurologic dysfunction.

      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: C) Focal Seizure with Impaired Awareness Explanation: The patient's unresponsiveness, automatisms, and post-seizure confusion are characteristics of focal seizure with impaired awareness. Focal Seizure with Impaired Awareness Impaired Awareness : During the seizure, patients lose their ability to respond to external stimuli and are unaware of the event. They may not recall the seizure (ictal phase) afterwards. Aura : Seizures often begin with an aura, where patients experience unusual internal sensations such as fear, déjà vu, depersonalisation, or visual distortions like micropsia (objects appearing smaller) or macropsia (objects appearing larger). These are subjective events not observable by others. Motionless Stare : The ictal phase is typically marked by a sudden, motionless stare, signalling the onset of impaired awareness. Automatisms : Patients may perform automatic, involuntary behaviours like chewing, lip-smacking, swallowing, or repetitive hand movements. More complex actions, like displaying emotions or running, may also occur. Post-Seizure Confusion : After the seizure, patients are often confused, and the recovery time can range from seconds to over an hour. Postictal Symptoms : Neurological deficits such as anterograde amnesia, aphasia, or visual disturbances may follow the seizure, depending on which cortical regions were involved. Image showing abnormal high voltage in right temporal leads. Since the abnormal electrical activity is seen only in some leads, it is a focal seizure.

Jacksonian March describes a focal motor seizure where abnormal movements start in one part of the body, like the hand, and gradually spread to other nearby areas, such as the arm and face . The seizure progresses in a “marching” pattern, following the motor cortex's representation of the body. Absence seizure (Option A): This seizure typically involves a brief loss of awareness, where the person appears to “zone out” and is unresponsive. It is predominantly seen in children. Motor symptoms are usually absent , and the person does not experience the spreading involuntary movements seen in this patient. Todd’s paralysis (Option B): Todd’s paralysis is a temporary weakness (paresis) affecting the same area involved in a seizure. It usually occurs after the seizure has ended ( postictally ), which is not the case in this patient. It is also a feature of focal motor seizures with intact awareness. Epilepsia partialis continua (Option C): This refers to prolonged, continuous focal motor seizures, often restricted to one part of the body, lasting hours or even days .

      "explanation": "Correct Answer: A) Focal seizure with retained awareness Explanation: As the patient experiences localized visual disturbances, such as flashing lights and coloured shapes, without any loss of awareness, it is a focal seizure with retained awareness. In focal seizures with retained awareness, individuals can respond to their environment and are aware of their experiences during the seizure. Classification of Focal Seizures Focal seizures originate from a specific area in one hemisphere of the brain. Classification by Awareness Focal Seizures with Retained Awareness No loss of awareness during the seizure, symptoms depend on the brain area affected like visual disturbances, motor jerking, and sensory changes.
