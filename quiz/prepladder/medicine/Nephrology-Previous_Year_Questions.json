      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: C) Acute respiratory acidosis, acute respiratory alkalosis Explanation: A - Acute respiratory acidosis occurs when there is an increase in the partial pressure of carbon dioxide (PaCO 2 ) in the blood due to inadequate ventilation. This can be caused by conditions such as pneumonia, pulmonary edema, or airway obstruction. D - Acute respiratory alkalosis occurs when there is a decrease in PaCO 2 in the blood due to excessive ventilation. It can be caused by hyperventilation due to anxiety, fever, or high altitude. Acid-base disorders Simple acid-base disorders and their compensatory mechanisms: Primary respiratory disturbances (changes in PaCO I ) lead to metabolic compensation (changes in [HCO II ] ). Primary metabolic disturbances (changes in [HCO II ] ) lead to respiratory compensation (changes in PaCO I ). Compensation moves pH toward normal , but typically does not fully correct it, except for chronic respiratory alkalosis , which may restore normal pH. Metabolic acidosis (e.g., from ketoacidosis or lactic acidosis) lowers [HCO II ] and extracellular pH , triggers",

      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer A - Urinary sodium <20 mEq/L In SIADH, urinary sodium is typically > 40 mEq/L, not < 20 mEq/L , due to volume expansion and natriuresis. Syndrome of Inappropriate Antidiuretic Hormone Secretion (SIADH) Definition Excessive ADH release leading to impaired water excretion and hyponatremia with euvolemia or hypervolemia. (Option D) Etiology CNS disturbances: Stroke, infection, subarachnoid hemorrhage, etc. Malignancies: Small cell lung cancer (most common), other cancers. Drugs: Carbamazepine, oxcarbazepine, SSRIs, \"Ecstasy\", NSAIDs, etc. Surgery: Pain-induced ADH hypersecretion. Pulmonary diseases: Pneumonia (Option A ruled out), respiratory failure, etc. Hormone deficiency: Hypopituitarism, hypothyroidism. HIV: Associated with infections. Hereditary SIADH: V2 receptor mutation. Pathophysiology ADH function: Regulates water balance by controlling plasma osmolality; excess ADH causes water retention, leading to hyponatremia. Volume regulation: In hypovolemia, ADH release is driven by volume receptors, worsening hyponatremia. Clinical Presentation Acute hyponatremia: Nausea, vomiting, headache, seizures, coma. Chronic hyponatremia: Nonspecific symptoms (nausea, confusion, falls in elderly). Diagnosis Schwartz and Bartter Criteria: Serum sodium <135 mEq/L (Option B) Serum osmolality <275 mOsm/kg Urine sodium >40 mEq/L Urine osmolality >100 mOsm/kg (Option C) The absence of clinical evidence of volume depletion (like normal skin turgor, blood pressure within the reference range) The absence of hyponatremia due to other causes (like adrenal insufficiency, hypothyroidism, cardiac failure, pituitary insufficiency, renal disease with salt wastage, hepatic disease, drugs that impair renal water excretion.) Tests: Renal function, serum osmolality, cortisol levels, thyroid tests, imaging for underlying causes. Management Fluid restriction: For mild to moderate symptoms. Hypertonic saline (3%): For severe hyponatremia, with careful correction rate (<8 mEq/L in 24 hrs). Medications: Vasopressin receptor antagonists (Conivaptan, Tolvaptan) Other: Loop diuretics, salt tablets, demeclocycline, lithium. Complications Osmotic demyelination syndrome: Risk from rapid sodium correction. Severe hyponatremia: Can lead to seizures, coma, and death in acute cases.

      "question": "A 40-year-old male presents with complaints of episodes of palpitations, headache, and profuse sweating for the past few days. MIBG scan shows a deep-seated tumour in the adrenal medulla. Which of the following statements is incorrect regarding the condition described?",
      "options": {

        "B": "Surgical excision is the definitive treatment",
        "C": "Propranolol is given initially to manage hypertension",
        "D": "Can present as hypertension alone and sometimes with vomiting and pain abdomen"
      },
      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: C) Propranolol is given initially to manage hypertension Explanation: The above condition is characteristic of pheochromocytoma . Episodes of palpitations, profuse sweating, and headache constitute a classic triad of pheochromocytoma. The diagnosis is typically confirmed by measuring urine vanillylmandelic acid (VMA) and catecholamine levels, and the definitive treatment is surgical excision. However, the initial management of hypertension in pheochromocytoma involves starting with an alpha-blocker to prevent a hypertensive crisis. Beta-blockers like propranolol are only added after adequate alpha blockade is established to avoid unopposed alpha-adrenergic stimulation, which could worsen the hypertension. Pheochromocytoma Description Pheochromocytomas are rare tumours arising from chromaffin cells of the adrenal medulla. The clinical features result from excessive secretion of catecholamines. Histopathology Histology of the lesion characteristically shows zellballen nests of chromaffin cells with strong positivity to chromogranin, synaptophysin, CD56, and focally to S100. The presence of chromaffin cells in the extra-adrenal tissue is the only pathognomonic characteristic of the malignant form of the entity. Clinical features Classical triad Episode of palpitation Headache Profuse sweating The dominant sign is Hypertension Vomiting (Option D) Pain abdomen Tachycardia Anxiety Subcutaneous neurofibromas Cafe-au-lait macules Thyroid mass Axillary freckling Lisch nodules on the iris Retinal angiomas Abdominal mass Diagnosis Diagnosis of pheochromocytoma can be established by biochemical confirmation of hypersecretion of metanephrines and catecholamines. 24-hour urine test Catecholamines (Option A) Fractionated metanephrines Total metanephrines Vanillylmandelic acid (VMA) (a metabolite of adrenaline and noradrenaline) (Option A) Imaging : CT scan of the abdomen and pelvis to locate the tumour. 18F-FDG PET scanning is recommended for metastatic disease. MIBG scintigraphy Somatostatin receptor scintigraphy Gallium DOTATATE PET scanning Differential Diagnosis Hyperthyroidism Renal artery stenosis Hyperaldosteronism Cardiomyopathy Postural tachycardia syndrome (POTS) Treatment The definitive treatment of pheochromocytoma is surgical resection. (Option B) Preoperative preparation of the patient has to be considered, and blood pressure should be consistently < 160/90 mm Hg. Blood pressure is controlled by alpha-adrenergic blockers (phenoxybenzamine 0.5-4 mg/kg of body weight) (vs Option C) Oral Prazosin or IV phentolamine can be used to control paroxysm. Unilateral Pheochromocytoma: Minimally invasive adrenalectomy: Preferred treatment for most unilateral adrenal pheochromocytomas. Open adrenalectomy Bilateral pheochromocytomas: Bilateral total adrenalectomy is associated with a lifelong need for steroid replacement with long-term side effects. Bilateral partial or cortical sparing adrenalectomy (open or laparoscopic) Complications Myocardial infarction Cardiogenic shock Renal Failure Pulmonary edema Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) Lactic acidosis Hypertensive retinopathy Hypertensive encephalopathy",

      "question": "A patient presents with a seizure. On evaluation, urine osmolality is 1000 mOsm/kg, and serum osmolality is 270 mOsm/kg. Which electrolyte abnormality can be expected in this patient?",
      "options": {
        "A": "Hypernatremia",
        "B": "Hyponatremia",
        "C": "Hyperkalaemia",
        "D": "Hypokalaemia"
      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: B) Hyponatremia Explanation: The serum osmolality is low (270 mOsm/kg, below the normal 285–295 mOsm/kg), indicating a diluted serum, while the high urine osmolality (1000 mOsm/kg) shows that the kidneys are still concentrating urine. This pattern is characteristic of euvolemic (dilutional) hyponatremia, most commonly seen in SIADH, where inappropriate ADH secretion leads to water retention and dilution of serum sodium. This severe dilutional hyponatremia can lower sodium levels enough to trigger seizures. Causes of euvolemic (dilutional) hyponatremia include: Drugs (desmopressin, oxytocin, antidepressants, opioids, thiazide diuretics, carbamazepine or its analogues, vincristine , nicotine, antipsychotics, chlorpropamide, cyclophosphamide , nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, MDMA) Syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone (SIADH) Increased ADH leads to water retention with near-normal sodium levels. Water overload leads to the release of ANP ( Atrial natriuretic peptide) from atria. ANP causes natriuresis which leads to euvolemic hyponatremia. No edema occurs. Causes of SIADH: Tumours Central nervous system disorders: stroke, trauma, infection, psychosis, porphyria Pulmonary disorders: pneumonia, tuberculosis, obstructive lung disease Drugs: anticonvulsants, psychotropics, antidepressants, cytotoxics, oral hypoglycaemic agents, opiates Idiopathic Addison's disease Hypothyroidism High fluid intake in conditions like primary polydipsia or potomania, caused by a low intake of solutes with relatively high fluid intake Medical testing related to excessive fluids, such as a colonoscopy or cardiac catheterisation Iatrogenic Incorrect Options: Plasma osmolality in hypernatremia (Option A) would typically be associated with increased serum osmolality (>295 mOsm/kg) due to a deficit of water in relation to sodium. Hyperkalemia (Option C) refers to an elevated level of potassium in the blood. It is not related to the given scenario as it occurs in conditions of metabolic acidosis, particularly in kidney disease, where potassium excretion is impaired. Hypokalemia (Option D) is a condition characterized by a low level of potassium in the blood. It is caused by diuretics, GI losses, and hyperaldosteronism.

      },
      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: C) Hyperkalaemia Explanation: Hyperkalaemia (greater than 5.0 mEq/L) is considered as one of the most severe manifestations of chronic kidney disease (CKD) (normal range: 3.5-5.0 mEq/L). As kidney function declines, the ability of the kidneys to excrete potassium decreases, leading to its accumulation. Symptoms may include muscle weakness, fatigue, palpitations, and, in severe cases, cardiac arrest. Chronic Kidney Disease Leading causes Diabetic nephropathy (Most common) Glomerulonephritis Hypertension Ischemic heart disease (Cardiorenal syndrome) Autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease Tubulointerstitial kidney disease Manifestations Weight loss Nausea Electrolyte Imbalances Hiccups (urea irritates gastric mucosa) Pedal oedema Muscle cramping and twitching Pruritus and skin pigmentation Uremic fetor Restless leg syndrome Uremic pericarditis Hypertension Fluid and serum electrolytes in CKD Electrolyte Imbalances Management Hypervolemic hyponatremia: High circulating aldosterone levels. Increase in water > sodium retention. Water restriction Hyperkalemia Patiromer Calcium resonium Sodium polystyrene Calcium gluconate or calcium chloride (for cardiac protection). Insulin and glucose (to shift potassium back into cells) Hypokalemia (rare): Usually due to overuse of diuretics Increase dietary intake and reduce the dose of diuretics Hyperphosphatemia Sevelamer Calcium acetate or carbonate Hypocalcemia Paricalcitol Decreased glomerular filtration rate (Option A) (GFR) is a hallmark of CKD and represents impaired kidney function. While decreased GFR is a key diagnostic criterion for CKD, it alone does not indicate the severity of the disease. The progression of CKD and its complications, such as hyperkalemia, are influenced by factors beyond the GFR. Increased creatinine (Option B) levels are indicative of reduced kidney function in CKD, they do not directly reflect the severity of the disease. Creatinine levels can also vary depending on various factors, including muscle mass, age, and hydration status. Proteinuria (Option D), the presence of excess protein in the urine, is a common finding in CKD. While it is an important marker of kidney damage and can be associated with disease progression, it is not considered the most severe manifestation of CKD.

        "D": "The treatment of chronic rejection has improved over the last 10 years"
      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: B) The transplantation is cost effective after the second transplant year Explanation: Renal transplantation is considered the treatment of choice for end-stage renal disease (ESRD) in patients with diabetic nephropathy with eGFR <20 ml/min. Renal transplant procedure: Preparation of the donor kidney: inspected and examined. The left kidney is preferred as it has a longer left renal vein. Operative technique: The donor kidney is transplanted into one of the iliac fossae (retroperitoneal location) leaving the native kidney in situ. Hence, a total of 3 kidneys in the recipient. The donor renal vein is anastomosed end to side to the external or common iliac vein. In a cadaveric donor, the renal artery is anastomosed end to side to the external or common iliac artery. In live donors, end-to-end anastomosis to the divided internal iliac artery is used more commonly due to the lack of an aortic patch (Carrel’s patch) . Indications for renal transplantation: End-stage renal disease caused by: G lomerulonephritis D iabetic nephropathy H ypertensive nephrosclerosis R enal vascular disease P olycystic Kidney disease/Chronic P yelonephritis O bstructive uropathy S LE A nalgesic nephropathy M etabolic disease (oxalosis, amyloid) Mnemonic: GD for HR POSt at 4 AM \"The survival rate of the graft is 95% in the first year,\" (Option A) is an overgeneralization. While the survival rate of renal grafts in the first year can be relatively high, it is not consistently 95% for all patients. \"The life expectancy is doubled in a diabetic patient with renal transplant,\" (Option C) is not entirely accurate. While renal transplantation can improve the quality of life and increase life expectancy in patients with ESRD, it does not necessarily double the life expectancy. \"The treatment of chronic rejection has improved over the last 10 years,\" (Option D) is not directly addressed in the given statement. Chronic rejection remains a challenge in renal transplantation.",

Diabetes Insipidus (DI): It is a disorder characterized by excessive hypotonic urinary output (>50 mL/kg body weight per 24 hours) and polydipsia (>3 litres/day). It results from an inability to concentrate urine adequately due to a deficiency or insensitivity to antidiuretic hormone (ADH). Types of Diabetes Insipidus: Feature Central DI Nephrogenic DI Primary Polydipsia Gestational DI Definition Deficiency of AVP (Arginine vasopressin) secretion from the pituitary gland. Kidneys are unable to respond to AVP, even if levels are normal. Excessive water intake, suppressing AVP secretion. Increased activity of placental enzyme degrading AVP during pregnancy. Causes Acquired : Head trauma, tumours, granulomas, infections, inflammation, toxins, vascular events, hypoxia. Acquired : Drugs (lithium, demeclocycline), metabolic disorders (hypercalcaemia, hypokalaemia), obstruction, vascular issues, granulomas, tumours, and infiltration. Dipsogenic : Inappropriate thirst, head trauma, brain diseases. Increased placental vasopressinase activity. Psychogenic : Psychiatric conditions, compulsive water drinking. Genetic : Mutations in the AVP–neurophysin II or WFS1 genes. Genetic: Mutations in the V2 receptor or aquaporin-2 genes. Iatrogenic : Belief in the health benefits of excessive water intake. Basal Plasma AVP Low or undetectable (<1 pg/mL). Normal or elevated (>1 pg/mL). Low due to suppression by excessive water intake. Low due to increased degradation. Urine Osmolarity Low (<280 mOsm/L).

This condition typically occurs after an infection, most commonly caused by Group A beta-hemolytic streptococcus . The diagnosis is supported by the classic presentation of cola-colored urine and recent history of throat infection . The condition develops due to formation of immune complexes by streptococcal pyrogenic exotoxin B (SPEB) , which get distributed in renal parenchyma and damage blood vessels, leading to increased protein excretion and hematuria. Post-streptococcal glomerulonephritis (PSGN) Cause Group A β -Hemolytic streptococci Pathogenesis Immune-complex mediated ( Type III hypersensitivity reaction) Clinical manifestations It is more common in children and young adults. History of impetigo (2-6 weeks) or pharyngitis (1-3 weeks ).

Test for antibodies Anti- DNAse Anti-Hyaluronidase ASO (antistreptolysin O) titer Lab findings Urine analysis: Red-colored urine, which turns dark ( cola-colored ) on standing ( hematuria ). Raised values of renal function test (serum creatinine, urea, etc). Raised serum potassium Low serum levels of C3, IgG & CH50 Normal serum C4 level. Pathological findings Gross findings: Flea-bitten appearance of kidneys Light microscopy: Hypercellular glomeruli (increased number of neutrophils, macrophages, endothelial and mesangial cells). Electron microscopy: Subepithelial humps (due to immune complex deposition) Immunofluorescence study: A starry-sky appearance (Granular) is observed (due to immune complex deposition). Management Self-limiting disorder Conservative and supportive management involves: HTN crisis : Labetalol (IV), sodium nitroprusside Pulmonary edema: Furosemide Antibiotics (Benzathine penicillin) Dialysis if needed Minimal change disease (Option A) is characterized by minimal changes in the glomeruli on microscopic examination and commonly presents in children with proteinuria, edema, and hypoalbuminemia. The absence of significant proteinuria and presence of hematuria rules out this diagnosis. Membranous Glomerulonephritis (Option B) typically presents with thickening of the glomerular basement membrane due to immune complex deposits, causing proteinuria, edema, and hypoalbuminemia. The acute onset and recent history of throat infection makes this diagnosis less likely.

These findings are suggestive of central pontine myelinolysis (Choice C). Central pontine myelinolysis (CPM) is a condition characterized by the destruction of the myelin sheath in the central portion of the pons, which is a part of the brainstem. It is typically associated with rapid correction of hyponatremia, especially when the correction occurs too quickly. In this case, the hypertonic fluids caused a rapid increase in serum sodium levels, leading to osmotic changes in the brain and subsequent damage to the myelin sheath in the pons. Incorrect Option : Option A . Brain infarct: Brain infarct (Choice A) refers to the obstruction of blood flow to a specific area of the brain, resulting in tissue damage. While hyponatremia can contribute to the development of cerebral edema and increase the risk of brain infarction, the rapid correction of hyponatremia in this case is more consistent with CPM. Option B . Brainstem injury: Brainstem injury (Choice B) can result from trauma or other causes and can lead to a range of neurological symptoms. However, the rapid development of quadriparesis following the treatment with hypertonic fluids suggests a more specific diagnosis of CPM. Option D . Rare cause of hypernatremia: Hypernatremia refers to an elevated serum sodium level.

      "explanation": "Correct Answer: D) Any rise in serum creatinine will be suggestive of acute renal allograft rejection. indicators of graft dysfunction. A rise in serum creatinine, even if small or unexplained, necessitates further investigation to rule out acute rejection. Acute Renal Allograft Rejection Acute renal allograft rejection occurs when the recipient's immune system identifies the transplanted kidney as foreign, leading to cellular or antibody-mediated immune responses that cause kidney inflammation and damage. Clinical Presentation: Typically occurs weeks to months post-transplant, but can occur later if immunosuppression is reduced. Symptoms may include reduced urine output, graft tenderness, fever, and malaise, though not always present. Any unexplained increase in creatinine should raise suspicion for acute rejection. Types of Acute Rejection: Cellular Rejection (T-cell Mediated): T-cells attack the graft, causing inflammation and tissue damage. Antibody-Mediated Rejection (AMR): Antibodies attack the donor endothelial cells, leading to endothelial injury and microvascular thrombosis. Confirmatory Investigation: Renal biopsy is the gold standard for diagnosing acute rejection and determining the type of rejection. Biopsy findings: Cellular rejection: T-cell infiltration and inflammation. AMR: Endothelial damage and microvascular inflammation. Treatment: Cellular rejection: Treated with increased immunosuppressive therapy (e.g., steroids, ATG). AMR: Requires treatments like plasmapheresis, IVIG, or rituximab.

      "explanation": "which is the most common cause in children . Corticosteroids work by reducing inflammation and suppressing the immune response that leads to proteinuria. The typical initial treatment consists of oral prednisone, with most patients showing a response within 4-8 weeks of therapy. Feature Steroid-Responsive Nephrotic Syndrome Steroid-Resistant Nephrotic Syndrome Definition Nephrotic syndrome that responds well to corticosteroid treatment. Nephrotic syndrome that does not improve despite adequate corticosteroid treatment (e.g., prednisolone at 2 mg/kg/day for 6 weeks). Types: Initial Steroid Resistance: Lack of response from the onset. Late Steroid Resistance: Resistance develops after initial response. Common Type Minimal Change Nephrotic Syndrome (MCNS) accounts for about 80% of cases in children. It is often associated with Focal Segmental Glomerulosclerosis (FSGS) or genetic mutations affecting podocytes. Diagnosis Diagnosed without kidney biopsy; characterised by heavy proteinuria, low serum albumin, and no significant glomerular damage. Further investigation (e.g., kidney biopsy) is required to determine the underlying cause. Management Responds to high-dose corticosteroids (e.g., prednisolone) , leading to remission of proteinuria and oedema within 10-14 days. Treatment may include immunosuppressive agents, calcineurin inhibitors, or other therapies, as corticosteroids are often ineffective. Steroids and cyclophosphamide (Option B): While this combination may be used in steroid-resistant cases or specific types of nephrotic syndrome, it is not the first-line treatment for nephrotic syndrome in children, which is mainly due to Minimal change disease. The addition of cyclophosphamide is reserved for cases that fail to respond to steroids alone or have frequent relapses. Also, the potential toxicity of cyclophosphamide makes it unsuitable as an initial therapy. Cyclophosphamide (Option C): Using cyclophosphamide alone is not the recommended initial treatment for nephrotic syndrome in children. It is typically used as a second-line agent in steroid-resistant cases or specific pathological variants. ACE inhibitors (Option D): While ACE inhibitors can help reduce proteinuria and are often used as adjunctive therapy, they are not the primary treatment for nephrotic syndrome. They are typically used in conjunction with immunosuppressive therapy, which is the mainstay for treating the underlying cause of nephrotic syndrome.

Explanation: Starting ACE inhibitors early in the progression of diabetic nephropathy, particularly with the presence of microalbuminuria, has demonstrated significant benefits in reducing the risk of kidney failure and cardiovascular events . Management of Diabetic nephropathy Oral Hypoglycemic agents (OHAs) SGLT2 inhibitors lower the risk of cardiovascular events and renal failure; they are also recently approved for HFpEF. For HbA1C < 9.5%, OHAs can be used Metformin is withheld if eGFR is < 30 mL/min/1.73 m2 (Option C) , and drugs safe in renal failure can be used like Glipizide Linagliptin Repaglinide Insulin 80% of the calculated dose is started if HbA1C > 9.5% (Option B) Antihypertensives In the presence of microalbuminuria, ACEi and ARBs have shown evidence to slow the progression of nephropathy if started in early stages.

      "explanation": "characterized by the inability of the distal tubules of the kidneys to excrete hydrogen ions, leading to an alkaline urinary pH (usually >5.5). Patients typically have a normal anion gap metabolic acidosis, hypokalemia (low potassium), and a low serum bicarbonate level. In this case, the blood pH is mildly acidotic (7.3), with a low HCO II (12 mEq/L) and hypokalemia (K+ of 2.8 mEq/L). The urine pH is markedly alkaline (9.4), which is consistent with RTA Type 1. Incorrect Options: Option B - RTA Type 2 (Proximal RTA) : RTA Type 2, or proximal RTA, involves a defect in bicarbonate reabsorption in the proximal tubule, leading to a loss of bicarbonate in the urine and subsequent metabolic acidosis. Urine is typically acidic (pH < 5.5) after the loss of bicarbonate is maximized. Patients can have hypokalemia, but the urinary pH would not remain as high (9.4) after the plasma bicarbonate is depleted, making this less likely. Option C - RTA Type 4 : RTA Type 4 is characterized by hyperkalemia (high potassium) and a normal anion gap metabolic acidosis. This type results from hypoaldosteronism or aldosterone resistance. In this case, the patient has hypokalemia (K+ of 2.8 mEq/L), not hyperkalemia, making RTA Type 4 an unlikely diagnosis. Option D - High Anion Gap Metabolic Acidosis (HAGMA) : HAGMA is characterized by a high anion gap due to the accumulation of unmeasured anions (e.g., lactate, ketoacids, toxins). The calculated anion gap here is normal (AG = Na - [Cl + HCO I ] = 134 - [113 + 12] = 9), which does not support a diagnosis of HAGMA. Therefore, HAGMA is not the correct answer.",

      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: B) Amiloride Explanation: Amiloride is a potassium-sparing diuretic that acts by inhibiting the epithelial sodium channel (ENaC) in the distal nephron. When used in combination with thiazide diuretics, it helps prevent hypokalemia while maintaining Thiazide’s antihypertensive efficacy . This combination approach is particularly useful in patients experiencing thiazide-induced hypokalemia. Amiloride works as a weak antihypertensive but is valuable for its potassium-sparing properties, though it should be used cautiously in patients with renal failure or hyperkalemia. Classification of Diuretics : Type Mechanism of action Examples Clinical uses Side effects Carbonic anhydrase inhibitors Inhibit carbonic anhydrase enzyme in the proximal tubule, decreasing bicarbonate reabsorption Acetazolamide, Methazolamide Glaucoma, Altitude sickness Metabolic acidosis, Hypokalemia Loop diuretics Inhibit the Na-K-2Cl symporter in the thick ascending loop of Henle Furosemide, Bumetanide Acute pulmonary edema, Chronic heart failure, Hypercalcemia Hypokalemia, Ototoxicity, Metabolic alkalosis, Hyperglycemia, Hyperuricemia Thiazide diuretics Inhibit sodium reabsorption in the distal convoluted tubule Hydrochlorothiazide, Chlorthalidone Hypertension, Edema Hypokalemia, Hyponatremia, Hyperglycemia Hyperuricemia Potassium-sparing Inhibit sodium channels in the distal nephron or block aldosterone receptors Spironolactone, Amiloride Heart failure, Hyperaldosteronism Hyperkalemia, Gynecomastia (for Spironolactone) Osmotic diuretics Increase osmolarity of the glomerular filtrate, inhibiting water reabsorption. Mannitol, Glycerin Cerebral oedema, Acute glaucoma Dehydration, Electrolyte imbalance Furosemide (Option A): This is a loop diuretic that actually increases potassium excretion and can worsen hypokalemia. It is primarily used in patients with reduced GFR, CHF, or conditions requiring significant sodium excretion. Acetazolamide (Option C) : This carbonic anhydrase inhibitor is mainly used for treating glaucoma, altitude sickness, and periodic paralysis. It does not prevent potassium loss and can actually contribute to electrolyte imbalances. Indapamide (Option D) : This thiazide-like diuretic, similar to traditional thiazides, can cause potassium depletion and would not help prevent hypokalemia. It shares the same mechanism of action and side effect profile as other thiazide diuretics. Reference: Goodman & Gilman's The Pharmacological Basis of Therapeutics, 14th Edition, Page 562",

      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: A) Lorazepam followed by levetiracetam Explanation: Status epilepticus (SE) is defined as continuous seizures or repetitive, discrete seizures with impaired consciousness lasting more than 30 minutes. They are generally of 2 types: Generalized convulsive status epilepticus (GCSE) GCSE is an emergency and must be treated immediately (e.g., persistent, generalized electrographic seizures, coma, and tonic-clonic movements). Nonconvulsive status epilepticus (NCSE) E.g., persistent absence seizures or focal seizures with confusion or partially impaired consciousness, and minimal motor abnormalities. In the case of impending and early SE, the standard protocol involves administering IV lorazepam 0.1 mg/kg followed by levetiracetam 20-30 mg/kg . For established and early refractory SE, the treatment progresses to Propofol 2 mg/kg IV followed by 2-10 mg/kg/hr with the addition of anticonvulsants like levetiracetam . Management of Status Epilepticus: Valproate followed by gabapentin (Option B) : While valproate can be used in the treatment of GTCS, this combination is not the standard first-line treatment for status epilepticus. Gabapentin is typically used for chronic seizure management rather than acute status epilepticus. Carbamazepine followed by lorazepam (Option C) : Carbamazepine is primarily used in the treatment of partial or focal seizures and is not appropriate for acute status epilepticus. Additionally, benzodiazepines should be administered first in status epilepticus, not after other anticonvulsants. Levetiracetam followed by valproate (Option D) : This sequence is incorrect as benzodiazepines (lorazepam) should be the first-line treatment in early status epilepticus.",

      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer B - Renal calculi The presence of flank pain, hematuria, and multiple calcifications seen on X-ray in both kidneys strongly suggests the presence of kidney stones. Clinical manifestations of Renal stones: Renal colic is typically characterised by severe, sharp, and fluctuating pain originating in the flank and radiating toward the lower abdomen or groin, based on the location of the stone within the ureter. Upper ureteral stone: Pain radiates anteriorly. Lower ureteral stone: Pain radiates to the ipsilateral groin or labium in females/testicles in males. Hematuria is a common finding due to ureteral irritation and damage caused by the sharp edges of the stone. Nausea and vomiting are frequently present due to the intensity of pain and reno-gastric reflex. Investigations for renal calculi Lab investigations: Urine analysis (24-hour urine analysis) and blood tests should be conducted to assess serum levels of calcium, uric acid, phosphate, oxalate, and other relevant substances. Radiological investigations: Helical CT abdomen (non-contrast) is the investigation of choice (gold standard) to confirm the diagnosis and locate the stones . Ultrasonography (abdomen, KUB) can also be done. X-ray (KUB) can also reveal radio-opaque stones such as Lysine, uric acid, and xanthine. Management of renal stones Medical management Surgical Management Analgesics like diclofenac, ketorolac, tramadol Fluid therapy: IVF (intravenous fluids) are administered to prevent dehydration Alpha 1 blocker: Tamsulosin (relaxes ureter and expels the stone). Extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy (ESWL): Indicated if the size of the calculi <2 cm . (Contraindicated in pregnancy and bleeding diathesis). PCNL (Percutaneous nephrolithotomy): If the size is >2 cm. Uretrorenoscopy Retrograde intrarenal surgery Pyelolithotomy and nephrolithotomy (rarely used). Parathyroid adenoma (Option A) refers to the enlargement of one or more of the parathyroid glands, which are responsible for regulating calcium levels in the body. While Polycystic kidney disease (PKD) (Option C) can lead to kidney-related symptoms, such as flank pain and hematuria, the presence of multiple calcifications (stones) in both kidneys is not a typical feature of this condition. While CKD (Option D) can lead to various complications, such as the formation of kidney stones, the presence of multiple calcifications (stones) in both kidneys on X-ray is not specific to CKD.",

      },
      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer C - Nelson syndrome Nelson syndrome is a rare condition that occurs in patients who have had both adrenal glands removed (bilateral adrenalectomy) as a treatment for Cushing's disease. The hyperpigmentation of distal fingers post-adrenalectomy is due to the development of pituitary adenoma that produces excess adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH), especially in areas exposed to friction and pressure, such as the distal fingers. Nelson syndrome/post-adrenalectomy syndrome Definition Nelson's syndrome is a condition that typically occurs after bilateral adrenalectomy for the treatment of Cushing's disease (pituitary-dependent Cushing’s syndrome). The removal of the adrenal glands leads to a lack of negative feedback on the pituitary, resulting in increased secretion of ACTH . Over time, the pituitary gland may develop a pituitary adenoma (or enlargement of an existing adenoma), which secretes ACTH in excess. Prevention Prophylactic radiation therapy may be indicated to prevent the development of Nelson’s syndrome after adrenalectomy Clinical features Hyperpigmentation Bitemporal hemianopia Progressive visual loss in cases of large tumours Headache Weakness and fatigue Inhibition of the release of other pituitary hormones Evaluation Fasting Plasma ACTH Levels: Very high levels. Diagnosis confirmed by an ACTH increase >30% of the initial result on three consecutive samples after bilateral adrenalectomy. Decreased levels of anterior pituitary hormones . Brain MRI shows pituitary tumours or enlargement of existing tumours. Screening: Regular screening with fasting plasma ACTH levels and brain MRI in patients after bilateral adrenalectomy. Management Surgical Removal of the Tumor Radiotherapy / Radiosurgery Medical Treatment Hormonal Replacement Therapy Addison's disease (Option A) involves primary adrenal insufficiency, where the adrenal glands do not produce sufficient steroid hormones. Hyperpigmentation can occur due to increased ACTH levels, but Addison's disease is typically associated with adrenal atrophy or autoimmune destruction, not post-adrenalectomy. Conn's syndrome (Option B) , or primary hyperaldosteronism, is characterized by excessive production of aldosterone by the adrenal glands. It does not typically cause hyperpigmentation. Symptoms are usually related to hypertension and hypokalemia. Cushing syndrome (Option D) is caused by prolonged exposure to high levels of cortisol. It usually leads to symptoms such as central obesity, moon face, and purple striae, rather than hyperpigmentation of the fingers.

      "explanation": "red-colored urine, and the presence of more than 20 red blood cells (RBCs) per high-power field (hpf) with dysmorphic RBCs on microscopy, are indicative of glomerular involvement, which points toward a kidney-related issue. Among the options provided, PSGN is the most likely diagnosis for several reasons: Hematuria (Presence of RBCs in urine): The patient's history of red-colored urine and the presence of more than 20 RBCs/hpf in the urine sample indicate hematuria, which is a hallmark of glomerular pathology. Dysmorphic RBCs: Dysmorphic RBCs in the urine are a characteristic feature of glomerular bleeding. These abnormally shaped RBCs are a result of mechanical damage as they pass through the damaged glomerular capillaries. Flank Pain and Fatigue: Flank pain and fatigue can be associated with glomerulonephritis due to impaired kidney function and inflammation. History of Red-Colored Urine: The history of red-colored urine, also known as hematuria, further supports the presence of glomerular involvement. Incorrect Options: Option A - Minimal Change Disease: This is a form of nephrotic syndrome, characterized by massive proteinuria and minimal changes on light microscopy. It typically presents with proteinuria, edema, and normal to slightly elevated blood pressure. It doesn't usually cause gross hematuria or flank pain. Option C - UTI (Urinary Tract Infection): While a UTI can cause hematuria, it is less likely to cause dysmorphic RBCs and would not explain the flank pain and fatigue. Option D - Bladder Calculi: Bladder calculi (stones) might cause hematuria, but they would not explain the presence of dysmorphic RBCs, and typically, the pain associated with bladder stones is localized to the lower abdomen and not the flanks.",

      "explanation": "Correct Answer D - IV Mannitol: The given scenario is suggestive of the dialysis disequilibrium syndrome (DDS) or the reverse urea effect. Dialysis Disequilibrium Syndrome (DDS) is an acute neurological complication, often seen in patients undergoing their first hemodialysis session. It results from the rapid removal of urea and solutes, creating an osmotic gradient between the blood and brain interstitial fluid. This gradient causes water to shift into brain cells, leading to cerebral edema. Features: Symptoms: Headache, nausea, vomiting, blurred vision, restlessness, confusion, muscle cramps, tremors, and in severe cases, seizures or coma. Risk Factors: First hemodialysis session, high blood urea nitrogen (BUN >175 mg/dL), children, elderly, rapid dialysis, and pre-existing neurological conditions. Management: Modify dialysis parameters to reduce urea removal rates. Administer osmotic agents like mannitol to reduce cerebral edema. Provide supportive care for symptoms. Prevention: Initiate dialysis at a slower rate with shorter sessions. Adjust dialysate composition, particularly sodium levels. Avoid aggressive uremia correction, especially in high-risk patients. Complications associated with Hemodialysis During treatment Between treatment Hypotension: The most common acute complication during hemodialysis , especially in patients with diabetes mellitus. Muscle cramps . Anaphylactoid reactions: These reactions, particularly to the dialyser, are most common during its first use and are often associated with bio incompatible cellulosic-containing membranes. Cardiac arrhythmias: D/t potassium & acid-base shifts. Hemorrhage: D/t anticoagulation & venous needle disconnection. Air embolism: D/t faulty lines & equipment malfunction. Pulmonary oedema (D/t fluid overload). Systemic sepsis: Usually involves vascular access devices (catheter or fistula). Dialysis disequilibrium syndrome typically occurs during or after a patient's first dialysis session. It presents with confusion, restlessness, headache, and muscle twitching. It is caused by a urea gradient between the CSF and blood that raises intracranial pressure. Amyloidosis ( D/t beta 2 microglobulin ) Carpal tunnel syndrome ( due to amyloid deposition in the flexor retinaculum). Peripheral neuropathy Bumetanide (Option A): Bumetanide is a loop diuretic used to treat conditions like fluid overload or edema, but it is not indicated for the management of dialysis disequilibrium syndrome. It works by inhibiting sodium and chloride reabsorption in the kidney, and does not address the osmotic shifts causing cerebral edema in DDS. Ethacrynic acid (Option B): Ethacrynic acid is another loop diuretic that can be used in conditions like edema, but it is not the first choice for treating DDS. It does not counteract the osmotic gradient responsible for cerebral edema during dialysis. Nesiritide (Option C): Nesiritide is a recombinant form of B-type natriuretic peptide, used to treat acute decompensated heart failure. It does not address the underlying pathophysiology of dialysis disequilibrium syndrome, which involves osmotic shifts causing cerebral edema.",

      "explanation": "It may be used in certain situations, such as if the patient has concurrent magnesium deficiency, which can contribute to electrolyte imbalances. However, it is not the primary drug of choice for immediate intervention in hyperkalemia. Calcium gluconate (Option A) is commonly used in the emergency management of hyperkalaemia. It helps stabilise the cardiac membrane and counteracts the effects of elevated potassium levels on the heart.

It promotes the cellular uptake of potassium, effectively lowering its concentration in the blood. Insulin (Option C) , often administered with dextrose, is a key component of emergency hyperkalaemia management. Insulin drives potassium from the bloodstream into the cells, reducing serum potassium levels. Reference: Harrison's Principles of Internal Medicine, 21st Edition, Page 352, 353, 354, 355",

      "explanation": "Indicates no primary acid-base abnormality. However, the Bicarbonate (HCO 3 -) level of 23 mEq/L falls within the normal range- Suggests that there is a compensatory mechanism in place. Sodium (Na + ) level of 145 mEq/L is also within the normal range. Elevated anion gap of 100 mEq/L, which indicates the presence of an underlying metabolic acidosis. High anion gap metabolic acidosis is commonly seen in conditions such as diabetic ketoacidosis, lactic acidosis, and renal failure. In this case, the patient's chronic kidney disease is likely contributing to the development of high anion gap metabolic acidosis. Increased anion gap but HCO 3 is not reciprocally reduced indicating presence of metabolic alkalosis component. The above findings suggests a diagnosis of High anion gap metabolic acidosis with metabolic alkalosis. Incorrect Options: Option A - No acid-base abnormality: This choice is incorrect because the blood gas reports indicate the presence of an abnormality, specifically a high anion gap metabolic acidosis with metabolic alkalosis. Option B - Respiratory acidosis: The blood gas reports do not show any abnormalities in the partial pressure of carbon dioxide (pCO 2 ), which is a key indicator of respiratory acidosis. Option C - Metabolic alkalosis: This choice is incorrect because it only accounts for the metabolic alkalosis component of the patient's acid-base disturbance. Reference: Prepladder Notes",

Criteria AKIN RIFLE Definition Based on changes in serum creatinine and urine output. Based on changes in serum creatinine, urine output, and GFR. Serum Creatinine Increase in serum creatinine ≥ 0.3 mg/dL within 48 hours or ≥ 1.5 times baseline within 7 days. R (Risk): Increase in serum creatinine ≥ 1.5 times baseline or GFR decrease >25%. I (Injury): Increase in serum creatinine ≥ 2 times baseline or GFR decrease >50%. F (Failure): Increase in serum creatinine ≥ 3 times baseline or GFR decrease >75%. Urine Output Decreased urine output (<0.5 mL/kg/hour for >6 hours). O (Loss): Persistent acute kidney injury with complete loss of kidney function for >4 weeks. E (End-stage kidney disease): Persistent acute kidney injury with complete loss of kidney function for >3 months. Staging AKIN stage 1: Increase in serum creatinine ≥ 0.3 mg/dL or ≥ 1.5 times baseline or urine output <0.5 mL/kg/hour for 6-12 hours. AKIN stage 2: Increase in serum creatinine ≥ 2 times baseline or urine output <0.5 mL/kg/hour for ≥ 12 hours. AKIN stage 3: Increase in serum creatinine ≥ 3 times baseline or serum creatinine ≥ 4.0 mg/dL or initiation of renal replacement therapy (RRT) or urine output <0.3 mL/kg/hour for ≥ 24 hours or anuria for ≥ 12 hours. RIFLE classifies severity based on the R, I, F, O, and E criteria. Clinical Application Used in research, clinical trials, and clinical practice for AKI diagnosis and staging. Widely used in research, clinical trials, and clinical practice for AKI diagnosis, classification, and outcome assessment. Limitations Relies on serum creatinine and urine output, which can be influenced by factors such as age, muscle mass, fluid status, and medications. Similar limitations as AKIN criteria.
