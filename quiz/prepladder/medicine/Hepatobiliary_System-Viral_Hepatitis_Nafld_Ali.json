        "D": "Genotype 1 has higher spontaneous clearance."
      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: B) Hepatitis C RNA confirms active infection. Explanation: The presence of Hepatitis C RNA in an antibody-positive patient confirms an active infection. Investigations for Hepatitis C: 1. Serology and Virology HCV genome encodes multiple proteins, triggering antibody production that is used for diagnosis. Anti-HCV antibodies appear 6–12 weeks after acute infection. (Option A ruled out) Antibodies remain in serum even after clearance (spontaneous or post-treatment). Hepatitis C RNA detection in antibody-positive individuals confirms active infection. 2. Molecular Analysis Six viral genotypes exist, differing in global distribution and treatment response. Genotype 1 (common in Northern Europe) was harder to treat with pegylated interferon/ribavirin than genotypes 2 and 3. (Option D ruled out) Genotyping helps guide drug selection for treatment, though it does not affect liver disease progression. 3. Liver Function Tests (LFTs) LFTs may show fluctuating serum transaminase levels (50–200 U/L) . Jaundice typically occurs only in end-stage cirrhosis. 4. Liver Biopsy Serum transaminase levels do not reliably predict fibrosis, requiring liver biopsy for staging. (Option C ruled out) The Metavir scoring system grades fibrosis: 1: Minimal fibrosis 4: Cirrhosis Non-invasive fibrosis markers are now preferred, with biopsy reserved for unclear cases.

      "explanation": "Correct answer: B) Individuals with seropositive OBI have detectable HBsAg in their serum the liver of individuals who test negative for HBsAg, regardless of HBV DNA levels in the blood. It features HBV genomes as episomal covalently closed circular DNA (cccDNA) in a low-replicative state, leading to intermittent and low serum HBV DNA levels (typically <200 IU/mL). Seropositive OBI : Presence of anti-HBc and/or anti-HBs antibodies. (Option B) It accounts for about 80% of OBI cases Occur after the resolution of acute HBV or following chronic infection. Seronegative OBI : HBV DNA is the only detectable marker, either in the liver or rarely in circulation. This type may occur from the beginning of the infection or due to the progressive loss of anti-HBV antibodies. Clinical significance of OBI: OBI can be transmitted via blood transfusion or organ transplantation. (Option A ruled out) It may lead to viral reactivation during immunosuppression.

      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "débridement. Correct Answer: B) Start high-dose intravenous penicillin and perform aggressive surgical débridement. Explanation: Gas gangrene is primarily treated with high-dose intravenous penicillin to combat the Clostridium species causing the infection, alongside aggressive surgical débridement to remove necrotic tissue. This approach is crucial for controlling the infection and preventing further complications, making it the most appropriate management strategy in this scenario. Treatment Options for Acute Liver Injury: Condition/Treatment Details Supportive Care Fluid replacement and shock management Address organ dysfunction Monitor urine output and blood pressure Severe cases may require blood transfusions, plasma expanders, or peritoneal dialysis Antibiotics Gas Gangrene : High-dose intravenous penicillin, clindamycin; alternatives: cephalosporins, metronidazole Pyogenic Liver Abscess : Initial regimen of ampicillin, gentamicin, and metronidazole; aspiration or drainage for large/unresponsive abscesses (Option C ruled out) Surgical Débridement Recommended for gas gangrene alongside antibiotic therapy.

      "question": "A 45-year-old male presents to the emergency department with jaundice, fatigue, and right upper quadrant pain. He has a history of heavy alcohol use, and reports increased consumption over the past month. Laboratory tests show elevated aminotransferases and bilirubin levels. Which of the following investigations is most appropriate to determine the cause of his acute liver injury?",

        "D": "Viral Hepatitis Serology"
      },
      "correct_answer": "D",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: D) Viral Hepatitis Serology Explanation: Viral Hepatitis Serology is the most appropriate initial investigation to determine the cause of acute liver injury, as viral hepatitis is a common cause that needs to be ruled out in patients with jaundice and elevated liver enzymes. Investigations for Acute Liver Injury: Blood Tests: Liver Function Tests (LFTs) : Measures bilirubin, aminotransferases (AST, ALT), alkaline phosphatase (ALP), gamma-glutamyl transferase (GGT), and albumin to assess liver damage. Prothrombin Time (PT) : Prolonged PT indicates impaired liver function and is a prognostic marker in acute liver failure. Factor V Levels : Sensitive marker of acute liver injury due to its short half-life. Toxicology Screen : Identifies potential drug or poison exposures causing liver damage. Viral Hepatitis Serology : Tests for markers of hepatitis A, B, C, and E to confirm or rule out viral hepatitis. Additional Tests : Ceruloplasmin and Serum/Urinary Copper : For Wilson's disease assessment. Autoantibodies : For autoimmune hepatitis evaluation. Immunoglobulins : To assess immune system dysfunction. Full Blood Count : Evaluates for anaemia, infection, or abnormalities. Imaging Studies: Ultrasound : Non-invasive, detects fatty liver, cirrhosis, or tumours but has limitations in early disease. (Option B ruled out) Doppler Ultrasound : Assesses blood flow, helpful for conditions like Budd–Chiari syndrome. CT Scan : Detailed imaging to identify masses, abscesses, or abnormalities. MRI : Excellent visualisation for diagnosing liver and biliary diseases. Liver Biopsy: (Option A ruled out) Purpose : Confirms diagnosis, identifies cause, and assesses liver damage. Method : Can be percutaneous or transjugular. Contraindications : Avoided in severe coagulopathy due to bleeding risk; transjugular biopsy may be considered. Prognostic Criteria for Acute Liver Failure: Cause of acute liver failure (e.g., paracetamol overdose). Time from jaundice onset to encephalopathy. Patient age. Severity of liver dysfunction (PT, bilirubin, Factor V levels). Presence of encephalopathy. Patients meeting adverse prognostic criteria should be referred for liver transplantation evaluation promptly. Toxicology Screen (Option C) can help identify drug-induced liver injury but may not be the most effective first step compared to assessing for viral hepatitis, especially considering the patient's alcohol use history.

      "question": "A 40-year-old woman presents to the emergency department with complaints of fatigue, nausea, and right upper quadrant discomfort. O/E, she appears mildly jaundiced with yellowing of the sclera. She is drowsy but can be easily aroused. Her family reports that she has been more irritable than usual, displaying some behavioural changes. She denies any recent travel or known infections but admits to consuming alcohol excessively over the past month. Which of the following signs or symptoms is most characteristic of the severity of her condition?",
      "options": {
        "A": "Elevated serum bilirubin levels",
        "B": "Normal liver function tests",
        "C": "Increased appetite",
        "D": "Significant weight loss"
      },
      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: A) Elevated serum bilirubin levels Explanation: The clinical presentation is suggestive of acute liver injury , likely due to excessive alcohol consumption, resulting in jaundice and alterations in mental status. The combination of fatigue, irritability, and jaundice, alongside her alcohol history, points towards possible alcoholic hepatitis or acute liver failure. Elevated serum bilirubin levels are indicative of liver dysfunction, leading to jaundice and are characteristic of acute liver injury severity. Acute Liver Injury: Causes of Acute Liver Injury: Cause Description Viral hepatitis Infections (A, B, E) that target the liver, causing inflammation and damage. Alcoholic liver disease Resulting from excessive alcohol consumption, it can present acutely with jaundice due to hepatitis. Autoimmune hepatitis The immune system attacks liver cells, presenting acutely with jaundice. Drugs Medications (e.g., paracetamol, halothane) and herbal remedies can lead to acute liver injury. Poisons Mushroom poisoning (Amanita phalloides) is a known cause of acute liver failure. Other causes Includes Wilson's disease, acute fatty liver of pregnancy, Budd–Chiari syndrome, and more. Features of Acute Liver Injury: Severity Symptoms Mild/Moderate Acute Liver Injury Abnormal liver function tests (LFTs) (Option B ruled out) Non-specific symptoms (e.g., fatigue), many asymptomatic. Severe Acute Liver Injury Jaundice: Yellowing of skin and eyes. Signs of acute liver failure: Rapid decline in liver function, potential hepatic encephalopathy. Cerebral disturbances: Often subtle and episodic in early stages. Early signs of encephalopathy: Reduced alertness, poor concentration, behavioural abnormalities. Progression of encephalopathy: Drowsiness, coma, cerebral oedema (unequal pupils, bradycardia, hyperventilation). General Symptoms Weakness Nausea and vomiting Right hypochondrial discomfort Physical Examination Findings: Finding Description Jaundice May not be present initially. Fetor hepaticus A sweet, musty odour to the breath. Liver Size Usually normal or smaller; hepatomegaly is unusual. Splenomegaly Uncommon and never prominent. Ascites and Oedema Late developments, often a consequence of fluid therapy. Key Points: Acute liver injury can range from mild abnormalities to life-threatening acute liver failure. Cerebral disturbances and hepatic encephalopathy are key manifestations of severe acute liver failure. The absence of early signs of encephalopathy does not rule out significant acute liver injury. Increased appetite (Option C) is not typically associated with liver injury and may actually decrease due to nausea and malaise. Significant weight loss (Option D) could occur in chronic conditions but is less specific for acute liver injury, where patients might experience nausea and decreased intake instead.",

      "explanation": "Correct Answer: C) Grade 3 Explanation: Grade III includes disorientation to both time and space, somnolence to semi-stupor, responsiveness to stimuli, confusion, and bizarre behavior. The patient's symptoms clearly align with this grade, indicating severe hepatic encephalopathy. West Haven Grading of Hepatic Encephalopathy: Hepatic encephalopathy is a neuropsychiatric syndrome caused by liver disease, characterized by changes in intellect, personality, emotions, and consciousness. West Haven Criteria Description Minimal Abnormal results of established psychometric or neuropsychological tests without clinical manifestations Grade I (Option A ruled out) Oriented in time and space Trivial lack of awareness Euphoria or anxiety Shortened attention span Impairment of addition or subtraction Grade II (Option B ruled out) Disorientation for time Lethargy or apathy Obvious personality change Inappropriate behavior Grade III (Option C) Disoriented also for space Somnolence to semi-stupor Responsive to stimuli Confused Bizarre behavior Grade IV (Option D ruled out) Do not respond even to pain stimuli Coma Key Points Clinical assessment is crucial for recognising and grading the severity of hepatic encephalopathy.

      "question": "A 45-year-old male with a history of heavy alcohol consumption presents to the emergency department with fatigue, jaundice, and right upper quadrant abdominal pain. Laboratory tests reveal elevated direct bilirubin, alkaline phosphatase, and lactate dehydrogenase levels. His reticulocyte count is high, and the Coombs test is negative. The clinical features are consistent with Zieve syndrome. Which of the following is the most appropriate management for this patient?",

        "D": "Start intravenous fluids and monitor in the hospital"
      },
      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: C) Advise complete abstinence from alcohol Explanation: Complete abstinence from alcohol is the most appropriate treatment for Zieve syndrome, as it typically leads to the resolution of symptoms, including hemolytic anaemia and hyperlipidemia. Zieve Syndrome: Definition: Zieve syndrome is a clinical condition characterised by: Hemolytic anaemia. Unexplained jaundice. Hyperlipidemia. Association : Typically associated with alcohol use or alcohol-induced liver injury. First described : In 1957 by Dr. Leslie Zieve. Incidence : Estimated at approximately 1 in 1600 hospital admissions, suggesting it may be more prevalent than recognized. Clinical Features: Hallmark: Hemolytic anaemia. Cholestatic jaundice. Transient hyperlipidemia. Additional symptoms : Right upper quadrant abdominal pain. Nausea and vomiting. Malaise and weakness. Low-grade fever. Context : Symptoms often arise in the context of alcohol consumption and liver disease, with many cases linked to acute pancreatitis. Diagnosis: Key components: History of alcohol abuse. Clinical triad of symptoms (hemolytic anaemia, jaundice, hyperlipidemia). Biochemical tests : Elevated direct bilirubin. Increased alkaline phosphatase and gamma-glutamyl transferase levels. Haematological evaluation : Anaemia with elevated reticulocyte counts. Increased lactate dehydrogenase (LDH). Coombs test : Generally negative. Extensive investigations into hemolytic anaemia typically yield no definitive results. Management and Prognosis: Recognition : Timely recognition is crucial to avoid unnecessary procedures and treatments. Treatment : Condition typically resolves with alcohol abstinence, leading to improvements in: Hematocrit levels. Hyperlipidemia. Further Research : More studies are needed to explore the relationship between Zieve syndrome and pancreatitis, as this association is an area of ongoing research. Corticosteroid therapy (Option A) is not indicated, as Zieve syndrome is not an autoimmune condition. Liver transplantation (Option B) is unnecessary in this context; the syndrome is usually reversible with abstinence. Intravenous fluids and monitoring (Option D) may be supportive but do not address the underlying issue of alcohol consumption, which is central to the condition.

      "question": "A 48-year-old woman with a BMI of 32 kg/m² presents to the clinic with fatigue and mild abdominal discomfort. Laboratory tests reveal elevated liver transaminases, and an abdominal ultrasound shows hepatic steatosis. To further evaluate her condition, it is essential to exclude other potential causes of liver disease. Which of the following investigations should be performed first to rule out other liver diseases?",
      "options": {
        "A": "Liver biopsy",
        "B": "Blood tests for viral hepatitis markers",
        "C": "CT scan of the abdomen",
        "D": "NAFLD Fibrosis Score"
      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: B) Blood tests for viral hepatitis markers Explanation: Blood tests for viral hepatitis markers should be performed first to rule out viral hepatitis (such as Hepatitis B and C), as these are common causes of liver abnormalities and must be excluded before diagnosing NAFLD. Investigations for NAFLD: Excluding other liver diseases : Patient history : Assess alcohol intake. Check for drug use and risk factors for viral hepatitis. Review family history and symptoms. Blood tests : Viral hepatitis markers: HBsAg, anti-HBc, anti-HAV, anti-HEV, HCV. Autoimmune markers: ANA, ASMA, LKM, SLA, immunoglobulins. Metabolic parameters: Glucose, lipid profile. Confirming NAFLD : Imaging studies : Ultrasound : Common, but limited sensitivity. CT, MRI, MR Spectroscopy : More sensitive, less available. Distinguishing steatosis from NASH and assessing fibrosis : Liver biopsy : Gold standard for diagnosis and staging. Invasive, not suitable for all patients. Non-invasive tests : Blood tests: NAFLD Fibrosis Score, FIB-4 Score. Imaging: Transient elastography (FibroScan) to assess fibrosis and cirrhosis risk. Liver biopsy (Option A) is invasive and is not the first step; it is used later for definitive diagnosis and staging of liver disease. CT scan of the abdomen (Option C) may help identify liver abnormalities but is not the first-line investigation for excluding other liver diseases. NAFLD Fibrosis Score (Option D) is useful for assessing fibrosis but does not help in ruling out other liver diseases.

      "question": "A 50-year-old male with a history of obesity and type 2 diabetes presents for a routine check-up. His liver function tests show mildly elevated transaminases, and an ultrasound of the abdomen reveals fatty infiltration of the liver. He denies any alcohol consumption. His BMI is 35 kg/m², and his blood pressure is 145/90 mmHg. Based on these findings, he is diagnosed with non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). Which of the following is the most likely initiating factor in the pathogenesis of NAFLD in this patient?",
      "options": {
        "A": "Hepatitis C infection",
        "B": "Alcohol consumption",
        "C": "Insulin resistance",
        "D": "Autoimmune hepatitis"
      },
      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: C) Insulin resistance Explanation: Insulin resistance is a key initiating factor in the development of NAFLD, especially in individuals with metabolic syndrome, including obesity and type 2 diabetes. It leads to increased free fatty acid flow to the liver, resulting in fat accumulation (hepatic steatosis). Causes and Pathophysiology of NAFLD and Hepatic Steatosis: Non-Alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease (NAFLD) : Spectrum of liver disease starting with steatosis (fat accumulation) and potentially progressing to: Non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH). Cirrhosis. Primary liver cancer. Associated with metabolic syndrome , including: Obesity. Dyslipidemia. Type 2 diabetes. Hypertension. Pathophysiology of NAFLD: Initiating factors : Obesity and insulin resistance lead to increased free fatty acids in the liver. (Option C) Imbalance between fatty acid import/synthesis and export/catabolism results in steatosis (fat storage as triglycerides in liver cells). Progression to NASH : Combination of factors beyond the \"two-hit\" hypothesis: Oxidative stress : Free radicals damage liver cells. Lipotoxicity : Fatty acids and metabolites harm liver cells. Endoplasmic reticulum stress : Disrupted function of the liver’s endoplasmic reticulum. Gut-derived endotoxin : Bacterial endotoxins from the gut contribute to liver inflammation. Cytokine release : Inflammatory cytokines (e.g., TNF- α ) cause liver cell damage. Immune-mediated injury : Immune response attacking liver cells. Fibrosis progression : Cellular damage activates stellate cells, leading to collagen production and fibrosis, potentially progressing to cirrhosis. Indicator of Cirrhosis in NASH: AST > ALT Contributing Factors to NAFLD: Contributing Factors Details Sedentary lifestyle and diet Leads to obesity and insulin resistance. High intake of fat, cholesterol, calories, refined carbs Contributes to NAFLD development. Genetics PNPLA3 gene is associated with both alcoholic and non-alcoholic liver disease. Ethnicity Higher steatosis prevalence in Hispanics, followed by whites, then blacks. Gender White males are more affected than white females. Age and comorbidities Age > 45, diabetes, obesity (BMI > 30), and hypertension are independent risk factors for NAFLD progression. Hepatitis C infection (Option A) and autoimmune hepatitis (Option D) are causes of liver disease but are not related to NAFLD. Alcohol consumption (Option B) is excluded by the patient's history, and NAFLD is by definition not related to alcohol use.

        "D": "Hepatitis B Immunoglobulin"
      },
      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "α Correct Answer: C) Pegylated Interferon- α α is the preferred treatment for Hepatitis D, especially in patients with a low to moderate viral load and elevated transaminases. It works by enhancing the immune response against the virus. Hepatitis D Treatment and Prevention: No specific vaccine for Hepatitis D. Prevention relies on Hepatitis B management because Hepatitis D requires Hepatitis B for replication. Hepatitis B vaccination is crucial to prevent Hepatitis D. Hepatitis B Treatment: . Nucleoside/nucleotide analogues : Inhibit reverse transcription of pre-genomic RNA to HBV-DNA. Examples : Entecavir and Tenofovir : First-line agents (potent, high resistance barrier). Lamivudine : Less common due to resistance; used to prevent HBV reactivation during chemotherapy in previously infected, HBsAg-negative patients. Pegylated Interferon- α : Boosts immune response. (Option C) Most effective in patients with low viral load and elevated transaminases (>2x upper limit of normal). Liver transplantation : Option when antivirals fail. Post-transplant prophylaxis : Antivirals and hepatitis B immunoglobulins to reduce reinfection. Hepatitis B Prevention: Prevention Method Details Hepatitis B Vaccine (Engerix) Provides active immunity in 95% of individuals. Recommended for Parenteral drug users, men who have sex with men, close contacts of infected individuals, patients on haemodialysis, chronic liver disease patients, healthcare workers. Hepatitis B Immunoglobulin (HBIg) Immediate protection, given within 48 hours of exposure to infected blood. Active-Passive Immunisation Combined vaccine and HBIg for immediate and long-term protection. Neonatal Immunisation Given at birth with immunoglobulin for neonates born to infected mothers. Preventing Hepatitis B through vaccination and management significantly reduces the risk of Hepatitis D infection. Entecavir (Option A) is a nucleoside analogue used to treat Hepatitis B, but it has limited efficacy against Hepatitis D. Lamivudine (Option B) is less commonly used due to resistance issues and is not the treatment of choice for Hepatitis D. Hepatitis B Immunoglobulin (Option D) is used for post-exposure prophylaxis but does not treat active HDV infection.

      "explanation": "Correct Answer: A) Positive HBsAg Explanation: HBsAg (Hepatitis B surface antigen) is the most reliable marker for an active Hepatitis B virus infection. In this case, the patient's symptoms—fatigue, mild abdominal discomfort, nausea, dark urine, and elevated liver enzymes—strongly suggest an ongoing infection. HBsAg typically appears 2-6 weeks before the onset of jaundice, aligning with the timeline of symptoms. Aspect Details Appearance First antigen to appear 2-6 weeks before symptom onset. It is either spherical or tubular. Duration Disappears in 1-2 months after jaundice onset May last 3-4 weeks and can persist for up to 5 months. Chronic Infection Indicator Persistence of HBsAg for longer than 6 months indicates chronic infection . Acute Liver Failure HBsAg may be negative due to viral clearance Recent infection indicated by the presence of IgM anti-HBc. Clinical Significance Reliable marker for HBV infection Detectable before liver damage is evident. Interpretation of Results Negative HBsAg suggests HBV infection is very unlikely (Option C ruled out) Presence of HBsAg during the acute phase indicates active infection. Associated Antibodies Anti-HBs indicates (Option B ruled out) Previous infection (with anti-HBc present) Vaccination (without anti-HBc). Appears 3-6 months post-infection or vaccination Positive IgG anti-HBc (Option D): it does not reflect current active infection and would not be expected in this acute setting.

It is primarily transmitted via the fecal-oral route, which is common in areas with poor sanitation, making it the most likely mode of transmission in this case. Hepatitis A Virus (HAV) Most Common Cause of viral hepatitis in Children Most Common Cause of Acute Relapsing viral hepatitis Virus characteristics: HAV is a 27-nm, nonenveloped, single-stranded, positive-sense RNA virus, resistant to heat, acid, and ether. Mode of Transmission: Fecal-oral route. (Option B) Incubation period: ~3–4 weeks. Pathogenesis: Replication is limited to the liver but found in the liver, bile, stools, and blood during the late incubation and pre-icteric phases. Faecal shedding, viremia, and infectivity decrease rapidly once jaundice appears. Clinical presentation: Asymptomatic cases Jaundice Cholestatic hepatitis Fulminant hepatitis - Acute liver failure, especially in older adults or those with preexisting liver conditions. Does not lead to chronic liver disease. Diagnosis: Acute illness - anti-HAV IgM antibodies.

        "D": "Transition to chronic Hepatitis B with moderate liver damage"
      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: B) The severity of damage cannot be determined from ALT levels alone ALT and AST levels are very high, bilirubin remains moderately elevated, indicating that although hepatocyte damage is ongoing, the liver is still functioning well enough to manage bilirubin clearance. Liver Function Tests (LFT) in Hepatitis B Liver damage and clinical course depend on the immune response to HBV, not the level of circulating HBsAg Aminotransferase levels (AST/ALT) Increase during the prodromal phase and before bilirubin rises. Levels do not correlate with liver cell damage severity. (Option B) Peak levels (~400–4000 IU or more) are seen during clinical jaundice. Levels decrease during recovery. Bilirubin levels Total bilirubin is divided into conjugated and unconjugated forms. Levels >340 µ mol/L (20 mg/dL) suggest severe disease. Jaundice in the sclera and skin is visible when serum bilirubin >43 µ mol/L (2.5 mg/dL). Bilirubin may continue to rise even as aminotransferase levels fall. Alkaline phospahatse (ALP) A fourfold rise in ALP levels is suggestive of obstructive jaundice. Comorbid conditions In patients with hemolytic anaemia (G6PD deficiency or sickle cell anaemia), high bilirubin (>513 µ mol/L or 30 mg/dL) may result from hemolysis and is not always a poor prognostic sign. Severe liver cell damage causing acute liver failure (Option A): In acute liver failure, there is significant impairment in liver function, leading to much higher bilirubin levels in serum. Therefore, this option is incorrect, as the patient's bilirubin levels do not indicate severe liver failure yet. Mild liver cell damage causing fulminant hepatitis (Option C): Fulminant hepatitis is characterised by massive liver damage and severe impairment of liver function, which would lead to very high bilirubin levels and signs of liver failure (e.g., coagulopathy, encephalopathy). Mild liver cell damage would not cause fulminant hepatitis, making this option incorrect. Transition to chronic Hepatitis B with moderate liver damage (Option D): It is often associated with fluctuating or mildly elevated ALT/AST levels rather than the acute, severe spike seen here. Therefore, this option is incorrect. Reference: Harrison’s Principle of Internal Medicine, 21st Edition, Page 2575",

She reports that she had a recent exposure to a friend who was diagnosed with Hepatitis B. Laboratory tests reveal that HBsAg is negative, but her liver enzymes are elevated. Which of the following is the most likely finding in this patient’s blood tests?",
      "options": {
        "A": "Positive anti-HBs only",
        "B": "Positive IgM anti-HBc",
        "C": "Positive IgG anti-HBc",
        "D": "Positive HBcAg"
      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: B) Positive IgM anti-HBc Explanation: The most likely finding in this patient’s blood tests is Positive IgM anti-HBc, which indicates a recent or acute Hepatitis B infection. The patient presents with symptoms such as fatigue, loss of appetite, and jaundice, along with a history of recent exposure to someone with Hepatitis B. Although HBsAg is typically the marker for active infection, its absence can occur during the window period. In such cases, IgM anti-HBc often appears first and is critical for diagnosing acute HBV infection. Aspect Details Location The antigen is located inside the core and is not detected in the blood. Antibody Response Antibodies (anti-HBc) are produced early in the illness. Types of Anti-HBc IgM: Appears early IgM anti-HBc may be the sole ⊕ marker of infection during window period. Indicates acute/recent HBV infection. IgG: Forms in the long-term Persists after the acute phase. Chronic infection/prior exposure (Option C ruled out) Clinical Significance Anti-HBc (IgM) can indicate acute infection when HBsAg is negative and before anti-HBs develop. Positive anti-HBs only (Option A): This would indicate recovery from a prior infection or vaccination, which is unlikely given her recent exposure and current symptoms. Positive HBcAg (Option D): While HBcAg indicates the presence of the core antigen, it is not typically measured in standard blood tests.
