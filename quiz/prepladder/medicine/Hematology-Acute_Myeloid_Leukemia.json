      "explanation": "Correct answer: B) Acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) Explanation: The most likely diagnosis in this case is Acute myeloid leukaemia (AML). Acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) is a hematologic malignancy characterised by the rapid proliferation of immature myeloid cells (blasts) in the bone marrow. AML is the most common type of acute leukaemia in adults. It is typically seen in those older than 65 years of age. The complete blood count, clinical presentation, and risk factors all align with this diagnosis. Elevated White Blood Cell Count: The markedly elevated white blood cell count (120,000/µL) indicates leukocytosis, which is common in leukemias, including AML. Presence of Myeloblasts: The bone marrow evaluation reveals 25% myeloblasts. A diagnosis of acute myeloid leukemia typically requires the presence of at least 20% myeloblasts in the bone marrow or peripheral blood. Cytopenias: The patient exhibits anemia (hemoglobin of 8.2 g/dL) and thrombocytopenia (platelet count of 30,000/µL). These cytopenias result from the replacement of normal hematopoietic cells in the bone marrow by malignant myeloid blasts, leading to decreased production of red blood cells and platelets. Symptoms and Physical Findings: The symptoms of generalized fatigue and difficulty breathing are consistent with anemia and potential leukostasis. Conjunctival pallor indicates significant anemia, while petechiae suggest thrombocytopenia. Risk Factors: The patient’s occupational history in the petrochemical industry indicates exposure to carcinogenic agents, which is a known risk factor for the development of hematologic malignancies, including AML. Acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL) (Option A) ALL may also show features of pancytopenia, but there is also typically lymphadenopathy. Further, the peripheral smear and bone marrow aspirate show lymphoblasts. Chronic myelocytic leukaemia (CML) (Option C) CML is commonly asymptomatic. When symptomatic, fatigue, weight loss, excessive sweating, abdominal fullness (due to splenomegaly), and bleeding are seen. Hyperleukocytosis is common, but the bone marrow would show multiple granulocytes, with a maturation pattern resembling a normal peripheral smear. Chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL) (Option D) CLL is commonly an incidental diagnosis in elderly adults. When symptomatic, manifestations",

      "explanation": "Correct Answer: A) 1-C, 2-E,3-D,4-A: Explanation: The French-American-British (FAB) classification of acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) categorizes AML into subtypes based on the morphology of the blasts and their differentiation. It includes subtypes like M0 to M7, each representing different stages of myeloid cell development. On the other hand, the World Health Organization (WHO) classification further refines AML classification by integrating cytogenetic and molecular genetic information along with morphology.

      "explanation": "Correct Answer: B) Brain Explanation: Hyperleukocytosis refers to a WBC count >1 lakh/mm3 in leukaemia . While common in all types of leukaemia, symptomatic hyperleukocytosis/ leucostasis is most often seen in AML. Symptoms occur due to capillary plugging, endothelial damage, and oxygen consumption by WBCs, causing end-organ damage. The most commonly involved organs are the brain (approx 40%), followed by the lungs (approx. 30%). CNS - Visual changes, headache, dizziness, tinnitus, gait instability, confusion, somnolence, coma, increased risk of intracranial haemorrhage. Lung - Dyspnea, hypoxia Other organs (uncommon) - Myocardial ischemia, renal insufficiency, priapism, acute limb ischemia, or bowel infarction. Diagnosis is clinical-suggestive manifestations along with hyperleukocytosis. It is an emergency with high mortality rates.

        "D": "Treatment includes anthracycline-based chemotherapy."
      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: B) Swelling is very painful Explanation: The patient's history of fatigue and weight loss, combined with the physical finding of pallor and proptosis, raises suspicion for an underlying hematological disorder. Bone marrow analysis revealing hypercellularity with a predominance of myeloblasts, confirms the diagnosis of Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML). FISH analysis identifying the presence of the t(8;21) translocation, which is commonly associated with a subtype of AML, further substantiates the diagnosis. The presence of orbital swelling in the context of AML and t(8,21) points towards Chloroma. CHLOROMA Definition: Chloroma, also known as myeloid sarcoma or granulocytic sarcoma , is a tumor consisting of myeloid cells that proliferate outside the bone marrow. It is a manifestation of acute myeloid leukemia (AML). (Option A ruled out) Clinical Presentation: Common symptoms include swelling or masses in various locations (e.g., orbit, soft tissues, skin). Swelling is typically painless and green in color. (Option B) Patients experience proptosis if the chloroma is located in the orbit, or neurological deficits if it compresses the spinal cord. Aetiology: Chloromas are often associated with AML but can occur in the absence of leukemia (de novo) as well. The condition is linked to the presence of t(8;21) translocations. Prognosis: The presence of chloromas generally indicates a poorer prognosis due to the aggressive nature of the underlying disease . (Option C ruled out) Diagnosis: Diagnosis is typically confirmed through imaging (CT, MRI) to identify the mass and biopsy to establish the myeloid lineage of the cells. C ytogenetic analysis (e.g., FISH) can identify associated genetic abnormalities. Treatment: Treatment usually involves systemic chemotherapy , often using anthracycline-based regimens . (Option D ruled out) Differential Diagnosis: It is essential to differentiate chloroma from other types of tumors or masses, including lymphoma, sarcoma, and other hematological malignancies.",

Coagulation profile reveals elevated PT, PTT, and D- dimer levels and decreased fibrinogen levels as seen in DIC.
