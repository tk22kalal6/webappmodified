      "question": "A 45-year-old male presents to the emergency with fever, severe headache, neck stiffness, and confusion. A lumbar puncture is performed, revealing a high white blood cell count with a predominance of neutrophils and elevated protein levels. What is the most appropriate initial management for this patient?",
      "options": {
        "A": "Administer oral antibiotics",
        "B": "Initiate intravenous broad-spectrum antibiotics",
        "C": "Start antitubercular therapy",
        "D": "Conduct a follow-up lumbar puncture"
      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "neutrophils and elevated protein point to bacterial meningitis . Immediate initiation of intravenous broad-spectrum antibiotics is essential due to high mortality. Bacterial Meningitis in Adults and Prevention Causes Streptococcus pneumoniae and Neisseria meningitides are the primary causes. Listeria monocytogenes is a significant risk in adults over 50, especially in those with diabetes, alcoholism, or weakened immune systems. Pathophysiological Process Treatment Immediate Management : Start with intravenous broad-spectrum antibiotics to cover pathogens. Treatment is then changed based on the identified organism and its susceptibility. (Option B) Adjunctive Therapy : Dexamethasone may be given to reduce inflammation and prevent complications, particularly if administered early. Supportive Care : Manage complications like raised intracranial pressure and seizures. Prevention Vaccines for H. influenzae type b, N. meningitidis, and S. pneumoniae. No vaccine currently exists for group B meningococcal infections. Chemoprophylaxis : Close contacts of individuals with meningococcal meningitis should receive prophylactic antibiotics like rifampicin, ciprofloxacin, azithromycin or ceftriaxone to reduce the risk of secondary infections. Rifampicin - 600 mg 12 hourly for 2 days Ciprofloxacin - 500 mg single dose Azithromycin 500 mg single dose Ceftriaxone - 250 mg Intramuscular single dose Administer oral antibiotics (Option A): Administering oral antibiotics is inappropriate for bacterial meningitis. This condition needs rapid action due to the severity and potential complications associated with the infection. Start antitubercular therapy (Option C) : While tubercular meningitis can cause elevated white blood cell counts and protein levels, it is not the most likely diagnosis given the clinical presentation (acute fever, severe headache, neck stiffness) and predominance of neutrophils in the CSF. Tubercular meningitis typically causes a more insidious onset and a predominance of lymphocytes in the CSF. Conduct a follow-up lumbar puncture (Option D): Performing a follow-up lumbar puncture without starting treatment would delay necessary care and increase the risk of complications associated with untreated bacterial meningitis.",

      "options": {
        "A": "Predominance of neutrophils with low glucose levels",
        "B": "Lymphocytic pleocytosis with normal glucose levels",
        "C": "High protein levels and no change in white blood cells",
        "D": "Presence of eosinophils with normal glucose levels"
      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "increased number of lymphocytes , indicating a viral infection. Glucose levels remain normal , which helps differentiate it from bacterial meningitis, where glucose is often low. HSV Encephalitis Diagnosis CSF Analysis PCR Neuroimaging and EEG Shows lymphocytic pleocytosis (increased lymphocytes). Normal glucose levels. Slightly elevated protein concentration. CSF PCR for HSV is highly sensitive (96%) and specific (99%) for confirming diagnosis. MRI is preferred for early detection of HSV encephalitis. Characteristic lesions appear on T2-weighted and diffusion-weighted MRI , affecting the orbitofrontal and temporal lobes. EEG may show periodic slow-wave activity in the temporal lobes, indicative of HSV encephalitis. HSV Encephalitis - T2 MRI showing high signal in Temporal lobe Predominance of neutrophils with low glucose levels (Option A): This finding is of bacterial meningitis rather than viral encephalitis. CSF analysis shows a significant increase in neutrophils and a reduction in glucose levels in bacterial infections. High protein levels and no change in white blood cells (Option C): Viral infections lead to lymphocytic pleocytosis, which is an increase in lymphocytes alongside elevated protein levels. Presence of eosinophils with normal glucose levels (Option D): Eosinophils are linked to parasitic infections or allergic responses rather than viral infections like HSV-1 encephalitis.",

      "explanation": "brain's temporal lobes , which are crucial for memory and language functions. Permanent neurological deficits, including memory loss, difficulty with speech (aphasia), and personality changes , are long-term outcomes. Early antiviral treatment is crucial to reduce these risks. Typical clinical features of HSV-1 encephalitis include: Altered sensorium for more than 24 hours Symptoms of brain inflammation- Fever, headache, seizures, focal neurological deficits Cognitive, behavioural & personality changes. (Commonly misdiagnosed for personality disorders. Other associated features can also be present, such as: Urinary and faecal incontinence Aseptic meningitis Rashes with dermatomal distribution Guillain-Barré syndrome. Peripheral neuropathy (Option B): Peripheral neuropathy involves damage to the nerves affecting the extremities, which is not a complication of HSV-1 encephalitis. HSV-1 primarily affects the central nervous system, particularly the temporal lobes. Sudden cardiac arrest (Option C): It is not a consequence of HSV-1 encephalitis. The disease primarily targets the brain, and complications arise from increased intracranial pressure or widespread neurological damage rather than cardiac events. Respiratory failure (Option D): While HSV-1 encephalitis can cause severe neurological impairment, respiratory failure is not a complication.

      "explanation": "symptoms caused by traction on pain-sensitive structures from low cerebrospinal fluid pressure (intracranial hypotension) following a leak of cerebrospinal fluid at the puncture site. Traumatic needles like Quincke, Babcock and also needles with lower gauge can cause PDPH. Definitive treatment with an epidural blood patch is recommended when symptoms persist even after conservative treatment. Management of PDPH: Bed rest for 8-12 hours Analgesics (Option D ruled out) Intravenous caffeine (Option A ruled out) Despite symptomatic treatment, if the headache persists: Low Volume Blood patch: For this procedure, 10 ml to 30 ml of autologous venous blood is injected by an anesthesiologist into the epidural space at the level of the prior procedure. This is thought to create a \"patch\" over the dural puncture and decrease CSF leak, or simply increase the intracranial pressure. Steroid therapy (Option C): Steroids are not indicated in post-lumbar puncture headache and have no role in treating CSF leaks.

      "explanation": "infection in patients with advanced HIV/AIDS, especially with a CD4+ count <200 cells/ µ L. The MRI findings of multiple ring-enhancing lesions further support this diagnosis. Therefore, the appropriate initial management is to start treatment with sulfadiazine and pyrimethamine with leucovorin. Cerebral Toxoplasmosis About Toxoplasmosis is a common secondary CNS infection in AIDS patients , but its incidence is decreasing due to ART. Occurs typically when CD4+ T-cell counts are <200/ µ L . Often represents the reactivation of latent T. gondii tissue cysts. Screening for IgG antibodies to T. gondii is recommended at HIV diagnosis. Pathophysiology Cerebral toxoplasmosis usually arises from reactivation of latent cysts. It is 10 times more common in seropositive",

      "explanation": "Test : Previously used to diagnose myasthenia gravis; now less common. Drug Used : Edrophonium bromide (short-acting anticholinesterase). Effect : Muscle function improves within 30 seconds, lasting 2-3 minutes. (Option A ruled out) (Option B) Limitations : Lacks complete specificity and sensitivity. (Option B ruled out) Safety : Intravenous atropine should be on hand to manage bradycardia. (Option D ruled out) Assessment : Plan the evaluation, focusing on specific speech or limb movements for objectivity.
