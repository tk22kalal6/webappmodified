      "question": "A 55-year-old male presented to the clinic for a routine check-up last week. He has no significant past medical history, but Automated Office Blood Pressure (AoBP) monitoring showed blood pressure readings of 142/94 mmHg, 138/86 mmHg, and 138/90 mmHg. Ambulatory blood pressure monitoring was advised; the average 24-hour blood pressure is 138/86 mmHg. According to the ACC/AHA hypertension classification, what category does his blood pressure fall into?",

      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: C) Stage 1 hypertension Explanation: Stage 1 hypertension is a systolic blood pressure between 130-139 mmHg or diastolic blood pressure between 80-89 mmHg. The patient’s ABPM shows systolic readings between 138-142 mmHg and diastolic values between 86-90 mmHg. Hypertension category based on the American College of Cardiology (ACC) Blood pressure category Systolic (mm Hg) Diastolic (mm Hg) Normal (Option A ruled out) < 120 < 80 Elevated (Option B ruled out) 120-129 <80 Stage 1 hypertension (Option C) 130 – 139 80 – 89 Stage 2 hypertension (Option D) ≥ 140 ≥ 90 Hypertensive crisis >180 >120 Hypertension Diagnosis Based on ABPM (ambulatory blood pressure monitoring) 24-h Average ≥ 130/80 mm Hg Awake (daytime) average ≥ 135/85 mm Hg Asleep (night-time) average ≥ 120/70 mm Hg Automated office Blood Pressure (AoBP) monitoring 3 readings to be taken Discard 1st reading The next 2 readings need to be averaged HTN if BP> 135/85 mmHg Reference: Blood pressure readings Harrison’s Principle of Internal Medicine, Edition 21st- Page 2076 Ambulatory Blood Pressure Measurement | Hypertension (ahajournals.org) Measurement of Blood Pressure in Humans: A Scientific Statement From the American Heart Association | Hypertension (ahajournals.org)",

        "D": "Subclavian artery stenosis"
      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: B) Coarctation of the aorta distal to the left subclavian artery Explanation: Coarctation of the aorta that occurs distal to the left subclavian artery typically does not cause a difference in blood pressure between the arms because the left subclavian and right brachiocephalic artery originates from the aorta before the point of coarctation. As a result, blood flow to the arms remains relatively equal. Conditions causing unequal left and right arm blood pressures Pathophysiology Aortic Dissection (Option A) Dissection occurring at the site of arterial branching from the aorta Subclavian Artery Stenosis (Option D ruled out) Atherosclerosis or other causes of stenosis (Thoracic Outlet Syndrome) in the subclavian artery reduce blood flow to the affected arm Takayasu Arteritis (Option C) Chronic vasculitis that affects large arteries, particularly the aorta and its branches Coarctation of the Aorta Congenital narrowing of the aorta affecting branches of the aorta and narrowing proximal to left subclavian artery (Option C) Reference: Subclavian Artery Stenosis - StatPearls - NCBI Bookshelf (nih.gov) Harrison’s Principle of Internal Medicine, Edition 21st- Page 2106, 2112, 2080, 2105",

      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: B) Liddle syndrome Explanation: Liddle syndrome is characterized by a mutation in the ENaC, leading to increased sodium reabsorption, volume expansion, and hypertension. The presence of hypokalemia, low renin, and low aldosterone levels is consistent with this diagnosis. Mendelian causes of HTN Disease Mode of inheritance Pathophysiology Key Features Liddle syndrome (Option B) Autosomal dominant Hyperactive ENaC reabsorbs sodium at elevated levels, resulting in volume expansion and hypertension Hypokalemia Low renin Low aldosterone Gordan syndrome (Pseudohypoaldosteronism type II) (Option A ruled out) Autosomal dominant Mutations in regulatory proteins for the NCC (sodium chloride cotransporter) channel allow for unchecked activity, causing subsequent electrolyte and fluid overabsorption Hyperkalemia Normal glomerular filtration rate Polycystic kidneys Autosomal dominant Large cystic kidneys Renal failure Liver cysts Cerebral aneurysms Valvular heart disease Pheochromocytoma (Option D ruled out) Autosomal dominant Neoplasia of the adrenal medulla generates heightened levels of norepinephrine and epinephrine Associated with MEN-2A (Sipple syndrome) MEN-2B VHL syndrome NF-1 Congenital Adrenal Hyperplasia (CAH) (Option C ruled out) Autosomal recessive Defects in steroid synthesis lead to buildup of intermediate metabolites with mineralocorticoid receptor activity 17- α hydroxylase deficiency: ↑ in aldosterone and thus HTN 11- β hydroxylase deficiency: ↑ in deoxycortisol which stimulates ENaC and causes HTN Glucocorticoid- remediable hyperaldosteronism Autosomal dominant Chimeric 11 β -hydroxylase/aldosterone gene Absent or mild hypokalemia Reference: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6613461/ Harrison’s Principle of Internal Medicine, Edition 21st- Page 2080",

      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: B) Normal intima-media thickness Explanation: In patients with long-standing hypertension, there would likely be increased intima-media thickness due to vascular changes.

      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: A) Brisk walking for 15 mins/day Explanation: The general guideline suggests at least 150 minutes of moderate aerobic activity per week, which translates to about 30 minutes a day, five days a week. Therefore, advising only 15 minutes per day might not adequately support effective blood pressure control. Hypertension lifestyle modifications Weight reduction BMI < 25kg/m2 (Option C ruled out) Dietary salt reduction <6g NaCl/day (Option B ruled out) DASH-type dietary plan (Option D ruled out) A diet rich in fruits, vegetables, and low-fat dairy products with reduced saturated and total fat content.
