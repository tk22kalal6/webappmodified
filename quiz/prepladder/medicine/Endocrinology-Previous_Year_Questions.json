        "D": "1,2 and 3"
      },
      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: C) 2 and 4 Explanation: The initial screening for diabetes in a PHC typically involves fasting blood sugar levels >126 mg/dL and a 2-hour post-glucose load blood sugar. The diagnosis of diabetes can be established using any of the following criteria: Fasting Plasma Glucose (FPG): ≥ 126 mg/dL (2) after an overnight fast. The result should be confirmed by repeating the test. Random Plasma Glucose (RPG) (3): > 200 mg/dL, done only if the patient presents with symptoms of diabetes such as polyuria, polydipsia, ketoacidosis, or unexplained weight loss. Oral Glucose Tolerance Test (OGTT) (4): A two-hour plasma glucose level ≥ 200 mg/dL after a 75-gram oral glucose challenge. For children, the test uses 1.75 gm/kg body weight. HbA1c >6.5 (Option 1) : HbA1c estimation is not typically used in primary health centers (PHC) in India due to limited resources, and it is usually only available in tertiary centers.

      "question": "A 29-year-old male patient presents with coarse facial features and gradual enlargement of the hands and feet for the past decade. He has been diagnosed with acromegaly based on elevated levels of IGF-1 and growth hormone that did not suppress after a 75 g glucose challenge test. What drug is recommended for treatment?",
      "options": {
        "A": "Lanreotide depot formulation",
        "B": "Terlipressin",
        "C": "Ketoconazole",
        "D": "Leuprolide"
      },
      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer A- Lanreotide depot formulation The clinical manifestations indicate active acromegaly based on typical physical changes and biochemical confirmation. Lanreotide is a somatostatin analog that has high efficacy in controlling GH and IGF-1 levels, as well as its convenient long duration of action . It is administered as a long-acting depot injection and is considered the first line medical therapy for acromegaly. The medication works by binding to somatostatin receptors on the pituitary tumor, effectively reducing GH secretion and consequently normalizing IGF-1 levels. Management of Acromegaly Surgical Treatment Transsphenoidal surgical resection is the preferred treatment, especially for those with GH-secreting adenomas. Post-Surgery: Improvement in soft tissue swelling and normalization of GH levels typically occur shortly after surgery IGF-1 levels normalize within 3-4 days. There is a 10% recurrence rate of acromegaly years later, and up to 15% of patients may develop hypopituitarism. Medical therapy Preferred in medical therapy if curative surgery is not feasible or if GH fails to decrease post resection Somatostatin Receptor Ligands (SRLs): Long-acting injectable forms (octreotide, lanreotide) . Normalizes GH and IGF-1 levels in about 50% of patients. Side Effects : GI disturbances, transient nausea, and gallbladder issues. GH receptor antagonist: Pegvisomant blocks peripheral GH receptors, normalizing IGF-1 levels in about 70% of patients, though GH levels remain elevated. It is administered through daily subcutaneous injections and is used for recurrences or poor responses to SRLs. Dopamine Agonists: High doses of cabergoline can provide modest GH suppression. Radiation Therapy External beam radiation therapy or stereotactic techniques are considered for patients not achieving biochemical control through surgery or medical therapy. Terlipressin (Option B): Terlipressin is a synthetic vasopressin analog used primarily for the treatment of hepatorenal syndrome and bleeding esophageal varices. It has no role in the treatment of acromegaly as it does not affect GH secretion or action. Ketoconazole (Option C): Ketoconazole is an antifungal medication. While it has been used off-label for some endocrine conditions (such as adrenal hypercortisolism), it is not indicated for acromegaly management as it does not affect GH or IGF-1 levels. Leuprolide (Option D) : Leuprolide is a gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) agonist commonly used for the treatment of conditions such as prostate cancer and endometriosis. It does not have any effect on GH secretion and is therefore not effective in treating acromegaly. Reference: Harrison’s Principles of Internal Medicine, 21st Edition, Page 2912, 2913, 2914",

      "question": "A patient presents with complaints of sudden onset headache, palpitation, and profuse sweating. The patient has had multiple similar episodes in the past. During these episodes, the patient's blood pressure is elevated. A 24-hour urine metanephrine is elevated. What is the most likely diagnosis?",

        "C": "Pheochromocytoma",
        "D": "Hyperthyroidism"
      },
      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer C - Pheochromocytoma The clinical manifestations indicate pheochromocytoma based on the classic triad of symptoms and elevated urinary metanephrines . Pheochromocytoma is a catecholamine-secreting tumor that produces excessive amounts of catecholamines, leading to paroxysmal symptoms including sudden onset headache, palpitations, and profuse sweating . The diagnosis is confirmed by measuring elevated levels of urinary metanephrines, which is considered the most sensitive diagnostic test for pheochromocytoma. The episodic nature of symptoms along with documented elevation in blood pressure during these episodes strongly supports this diagnosis. Pheochromocytoma Description Pheochromocytomas are rare tumors arising from chromaffin cells of the adrenal medulla. The clinical features result from excessive secretion of catecholamines. Clinical features Classical triad Episode of palpitation Headache Profuse sweating Dominant sign is Hypertension Tachycardia Anxiety Subcutaneous neurofibromas Cafe-au-lait macules Thyroid mass Axillary freckling Lisch nodules on the iris Retinal angiomas Abdominal mass Diagnosis Diagnosis of pheochromocytoma can be established by biochemical confirmation of hypersecretion of metanephrines and catecholamines . 24-hour urine test Catecholamines Fractionated metanephrines Total metanephrines Imaging : CT scan of the abdomen and pelvis to locate the tumor. 18F-FDG PET scanning is recommended for metastatic disease. MIBG scintigraphy Somatostatin receptor scintigraphy Gallium DOTATATE PET scanning Differential Diagnosis Hyperthyroidism Renal artery stenosis Hyperaldosteronism Cardiomyopathy Postural tachycardia syndrome (POTS) Addison's disease (Option A): Addison's disease is primary adrenocortical failure and presents with symptoms like fatigue, weight loss, low blood pressure, and skin hyperpigmentation. While adrenal crisis can cause symptoms such as headache and sweating, it does not cause an episodic elevation of blood pressure and is characterized by hypotension rather than hypertension. Also elevated metanephrines is not a finding in Addison’s disease. Renal artery stenosis (Option B): Renal artery stenosis can lead to high blood pressure but does not cause sudden onset headaches, palpitation, and profuse sweating. An elevated 24-hour urine metanephrine is not associated with renal artery stenosis as this condition affects the renovascular system rather than catecholamine production. Hyperthyroidism (Option D): Hyperthyroidism symptoms include weight loss, increased appetite, tremors, heat intolerance, palpitations, and sweating. However, an elevated 24-hour urinary metanephrine is not associated with hyperthyroidism, and the symptoms are typically continuous rather than episodic.",

      "question": "In a 60-year-old male, what is the primary etiology typically associated with Cushing's disease?",
      "options": {
        "A": "Small-cell lung cancer",
        "B": "Adrenal tumor",
        "C": "Ectopic ACTH syndrome",
        "D": "Pituitary microadenoma"
      },
      "correct_answer": "D",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer D- Pituitary microadenoma Cushing's disease in a 60-year-old male is most commonly caused by a pituitary microadenoma . This condition is characterized by a benign ACTH-secreting tumor in the pituitary gland, leading to hypercortisolism through increased ACTH production . The excessive ACTH stimulates the adrenal glands to produce higher levels of cortisol, resulting in the classic features of Cushing's syndrome. Cushing's syndrome- Definition and Causes Definition: Cushing's syndrome is a collection of symptoms resulting from prolonged exposure to high levels of glucocorticoids. Cushing's disease specifically refers to Cushing's syndrome caused by a pituitary corticotrope adenoma. It is relatively rare, but mild cases may be more common, particularly among those with symptoms like central obesity, type 2 diabetes and osteoporosis. Causes: Cushing's syndrome can be caused by various factors, categorised as ACTH-dependent or ACTH-independent. I) ACTH-dependent Cushing's Syndrome accounts for approximately 90% of cases. Cushing's disease (ACTH-producing pituitary adenoma) is the most common cause. Ectopic ACTH syndrome occurs when a non-pituitary tumour secretes ACTH . II) ACTH-independent Cushing's Syndrome constitutes the remaining 10% of cases. Adrenocortical adenoma is the most prevalent cause, accounting for 5–10% of all cases. Rare causes include: Primary bilateral macronodular adrenal hyperplasia (PBMAH) Primary pigmented nodular adrenal disease (PPNAD) McCune-Albright syndrome Small-cell lung cancer (Option A) can produce ACTH or ACTH-like substances, resulting in paraneoplastic Cushing's syndrome. However, it is not the most common cause of Cushing's disease in an elderly patient. Small-cell lung cancer typically presents with additional respiratory symptoms and a more rapid onset of hypercortisolism features. Adrenal tumor (Option B) can cause Cushing's syndrome through autonomous cortisol production by either an adenoma or carcinoma. However, these tumors bypass the pituitary-adrenal axis and typically suppress ACTH levels, unlike the elevated ACTH seen in Cushing's disease caused by a pituitary microadenoma. Ectopic ACTH syndrome (Option C) occurs when non-pituitary tumors (such as lung, pancreas, or thymus) produce ACTH. While this is a recognized cause of Cushing's syndrome, it is less common than pituitary microadenomas as the primary cause of Cushing's disease in older adults. Ectopic ACTH syndrome typically presents with more rapid onset and severe metabolic derangements.",

The consultant doctor made a tentative diagnosis based on the clinical symptoms. What would be the most appropriate investigative method to establish a conclusive diagnosis?",
      "options": {
        "A": "MRI",

        "D": "CT scan"
      },
      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer C- Sestamibi scan The clinical presentation suggests primary hyperparathyroidism , characterized by the triad of bone pain (from increased bone resorption), abdominal cramps (from hypercalcemia), and neuropsychiatric symptoms (manifesting as abnormal behavior) . Sestamibi scan is the preferred imaging modality for localizing parathyroid adenomas , which are the most common cause of primary hyperparathyroidism. Primary Hyperparathyroidism- Lab and Radiological findings Lab Investigations Serum calcium levels Increased Serum phosphate levels Decreased Serum alkaline phosphatase (SAP) levels Increased Serum PTH (parathyroid hormone) assay Elevated PTH Radiological features Features Image Subperiosteal erosions and terminal resorption in the phalanges (usually starts in the middle phalanx of the index finger's radial side ) along with bone demineralisation. The \"salt and pepper\" appearance, or pepper pot skull (lytic lesions in the skull). Brown tumour or osteitis fibrosa cystica: Cystic lesions in bone from excessive osteoclastic resorption appear as low-density, multiloculated cysts that can lead to bone expansion, accompanied by bleeding and granulation tissue. Sestamibi scan (Tc-99): Localize the parathyroid adenoma. MRI (Option A) while capable of identifying soft tissue masses, is not the first-line imaging modality for parathyroid adenoma detection. MRI is more expensive, time-consuming, and does not offer any significant advantage over sestamibi scanning for parathyroid imaging. Ultrasonogram (Option B) can identify parathyroid masses but has limitations in detecting ectopic parathyroid tissue and is highly operator-dependent. It may be used as a complementary imaging technique but is not the most sensitive primary diagnostic tool. CT scan (Option D) provides detailed anatomical imaging but lacks the functional information provided by sestamibi scanning. While CT may be useful for surgical planning, it is not the initial imaging modality of choice for diagnosing parathyroid adenomas.",

      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "and is associated with anosmia or hyposmia due to olfactory bulb agenesis or hypoplasia. Kallmann Syndrome: Pathophysiology: Kallmann syndrome results from defective synthesis of hypothalamic gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH). It is often accompanied by anosmia or hyposmia due to agenesis or hypoplasia of the olfactory bulb. This defect occurs due to mutations that impair the embryonic migration of GnRH neurons from the olfactory placode to the hypothalamus. Associated Features: Neurological and Physical Abnormalities: Anosmia or hyposmia Color blindness Optic atrophy Nerve deafness Cleft palate Cryptorchidism Renal abnormalities Mirror movements (neurological) Genetic Basis: Initial discovery: X-linked KAL gene mutations. Other genetic mutations include autosomal recessive (e.g., GPR54, KISS1) and dominant (e.g., FGFR1) mutations. Additional genes: GNRH1, PROK2, PROKR2, CHD7, PCSK1, FGF8, NELF, WDR11, TAC3, TACR3, SEMA3E. Some cases involve oligogenic mutations where multiple gene mutations contribute to the phenotype. Clinical Presentation: Males: Delayed puberty, hypogonadal features (e.g., micropenis, due to low testosterone during infancy). Females: Primary amenorrhea and lack of secondary sexual development. Low levels of luteinizing hormone (LH), follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), and sex steroids (testosterone or estradiol). Diagnosis: Typically, it is a diagnosis of exclusion after ruling out other causes of hypothalamic-pituitary dysfunction. Repetitive GnRH administration restores pituitary gonadotropin responses, indicating a hypothalamic defect. Treatment: Males: Long-term human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) or testosterone therapy to induce pubertal development and secondary sex characteristics. Females: Cyclic estrogen and progestin therapy to induce secondary sexual development. Fertility Restoration: Administration of gonadotropins or pulsatile GnRH delivery via a portable infusion pump. Syndactyly in males (Option B): Associated with Apert or Poland syndromes, not Kallmann syndrome. Precocious puberty in females (Option C): Kallmann syndrome causes delayed puberty, not precocious puberty, due to deficient GnRH secretion. White forelock (Option D): A white forelock (poliosis) is a feature of Waardenburg syndrome, a genetic disorder associated with sensorineural hearing loss, pigmentary abnormalities, and dystopia canthorum but not Kallmann syndrome.

      "explanation": "Correct Answer: B) Coxsackie B virus Explanation: Fulminant diabetes mellitus is associated with coxsackie B virus infection . Fulminant Diabetes: A rapidly progressing subtype of type 1 diabetes, leading to severe hyperglycemia and ketoacidosis within a short time. Pathogenesis: Exact cause unclear but likely involves genetic factors (HLA genes, especially DR4-DQ4) and viral infections ( coxsackieviruses A4, A5, A6, B1 , rotavirus, cytomegalovirus, Epstein-Barr virus, human herpes virus (HHV)-6, and HHV-7) Clinical Features: Rapid onset: Average duration of hyperglycemic symptoms is 4 days. Preceding symptoms: Common-cold-like symptoms and gastrointestinal symptoms are frequent. Near-normal glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c): Despite severe hyperglycemia and ketoacidosis. Absent C-peptide levels: Indicating no residual insulin secretion. No autoantibodies against pancreatic β -cells: Unlike classic type 1 diabetes. Elevated pancreatic enzyme levels. Possible association with pregnancy. Diagnosis: Based on rapid progression of hyperglycemia, ketoacidosis, and the above clinical features. Treatment: Immediate management of diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) with: Intravenous saline infusion. Regular insulin therapy. Long-term insulin therapy: Continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion (CSII) or multiple daily injections (MDI). Prognosis: Without immediate treatment, death can occur within 24 hours. Early recognition and prompt intervention are critical for survival. Diabetic ketoacidosis (Option A) (DKA) is a serious complication of diabetes, characterized by hyperglycemia, ketone production, and metabolic acidosis. However, it is a consequence rather than a cause of fulminant diabetes. Non-ketotic hyperosmolar coma (Option C) is a life-threatening complication of diabetes, marked by extremely high blood sugar and severe dehydration. Unlike fulminant diabetes, it is typically seen in type 2 diabetes. Autoimmune pancreatitis (Option D) is a rare form of chronic pancreatitis caused by an autoimmune reaction.

During examination, it was determined that the patient's serum glucose levels were 500mg/dL, arterial pH is 7.30, and there is an elevation in plasma ketones levels. However, the serum potassium levels are within the normal range. In order to treat this patient, which of the following should be added to the saline solution?",
      "options": {
        "A": "Insulin",
        "B": "Bicarbonate",
        "C": "Potassium",
        "D": "14 units of regular insulin intravenously"
      },
      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: A) Insulin Explanation: The patient's clinical features suggest diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA), a potentially life-threatening complication of uncontrolled diabetes. Insulin is the mainstay of treatment in DKA as it helps lower blood glucose levels and suppresses ketone production. DKA is characterized by hyperglycemia, metabolic acidosis, and the presence of ketones in the blood. To manage DKA, it is crucial to address the underlying cause of hyperglycemia and correct metabolic derangements. Updated Management of Diabetic Ketoacidosis (ISPAD 2022): Contraindication of Insulin Drip: Insulin should be withheld if the serum potassium level is below 3.3 mmol/L. The target is to maintain serum potassium levels above 3.5 mmol/L (3.5 meq/L) to start the insulin drip. Hypokalemia can lead to diaphragmatic paralysis and potentially result in respiratory arrest. Bicarbonate (Option B) administration is generally not recommended for DKA unless the patient has severe acidosis (arterial pH <7.0). In this case, the arterial pH of 7.33 does not indicate severe acidosis, and thus, bicarbonate is not necessary. Potassium (Option C) levels are normal in this patient, so additional potassium supplementation may not be required. However, regular monitoring of potassium levels is essential during the treatment of DKA, as insulin administration can cause a shift of potassium into the cells, leading to potential hypokalemia. If the patient's potassium levels decrease during treatment, appropriate potassium supplementation can be initiated. The specific dose of 14 units of regular insulin intravenously (Option D) is not mentioned in the initial description and cannot be determined solely based on the given information. The insulin dosage should be individualized based on the patient's clinical condition, blood glucose levels, and response to treatment. It is typically administered as an initial bolus followed by continuous intravenous infusion.",

      "options": {
        "A": "Propyl Thiouracil",
        "B": "Carbimazole",
        "C": "Sodium iodide",
        "D": "Radioactive iodine"
      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: B) Carbimazole Explanation: Carbimazole is the preferred medication for treating hyperthyroidism during the second trimester of pregnancy . Carbimazole is a thyroid peroxidase inhibitor that has higher potency and longer half life than propylthiouracil. However, it crosses the placenta easily, and can cause aplasia cutis in the fetus. For this reason, Carbimazole is not administered during the 1st trimester. Management of Hyperthyroidism in Pregnancy Medical Management First Trimester: Propylthiouracil 100-300mg/day (three times daily) Mechanism: Inhibits hormone synthesis + Thyroxine to Triiodothyronine conversion Second/Third Trimester: Methimazole 5-15mg/day (once daily) Monitoring: Thyroid Function Tests every 2-4 weeks Thyroid Stimulating Hormone Receptor Antibodies: 18-22 weeks, 30-34 weeks Target: Free Thyroxine upper normal, Thyroid Stimulating Hormone slightly low Thyroid Storm Protocol Propanolol Potassium Iodide/Lugol's solution (60 minutes post-antithyroid drugs) Propylthiouracil/Methimazole administration Glucocorticoids Intensive care support Mortality: 20-30% if untreated Teratogenicity Methimazole Embryopathy: Aplasia cutis Choanal/esophageal atresia Dysmorphic facies PTU Associated: Isolated anomalies Situs inversus Renal tract malformations Contraindications Radioactive iodine First trimester thyroidectomy Fetal Surveillance Ultrasound markers: Thyroid dimensions Fetal heart rate (>160/min significant) Growth parameters Hydrops features Bone maturation Propyl Thiouracil (Option A) : While propylthiouracil is the drug of choice during the first trimester of pregnancy due to lower risk of birth defects, it is not the preferred option during the second trimester. The switch to carbimazole is recommended after the first trimester due to its better efficacy and safety profile. Sodium iodide (Option C) : This medication is contraindicated during pregnancy as it can cross the placenta and affect fetal thyroid function. It can cause fetal hypothyroidism and goiter formation. Radioactive iodine (Option D) : Radioactive iodine is absolutely contraindicated during pregnancy as it readily crosses the placenta and can affect the fetal thyroid gland, potentially causing miscarriage or serious developmental issues. It should never be used during any stage of pregnancy. Reference: Harrison’s Principles of Internal Medicine, 21st Edition, Volume I, Page 2938.",

      "correct_answer": "D",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: D) 1,3,4 and 5 only Explanation: The clinical scenario of a female with neck swelling, weight loss, palpitations, exophthalmos, and a diffusely enlarged thyroid gland suggests a diagnosis of Grave’s disease. The essential investigations for this patient include thyroid function tests (TFT), ultrasound of the neck, thyroid scan, and anti-thyroid antibodies . Fine needle aspiration cytology (FNAC) is not essential in this case. Grave’s Disease: Onset typically between 20-50 years ; rare before adolescence but occurs in the elderly. Pathogenesis: Combination of genetics (e.g., HLA-DR, CTLA-4) and environmental factors (e.g., stress, iodine intake). Associated with thyroid-stimulating immunoglobulins (TSIs), which activate the TSH receptor. Clinical Manifestations: Weight loss (despite increased appetite), or rarely, weight gain. Hyperactivity, nervousness, fatigue, tremors, heat intolerance, sweating. Cardiovascular: Sinus tachycardia, atrial fibrillation (in older patients), palpitation. Neurological: Hyperreflexia, muscle weakness, rare chorea. Skin: Warm, moist skin; palmar erythema, alopecia, hyperpigmentation. GI: Increased stool frequency, diarrhea. Bone: Osteopenia, mild hypercalcemia. Specific to Grave’s disease: Diffuse thyroid enlargement (thrill/bruit may be present). Ophthalmopathy : Proptosis, diplopia, and optic neuropathy. Dermopathy (pretibial myxedema): Indurated, pink-purple plaques with \"orange-skin\" appearance. Acropachy (clubbing), rare. Investigation: TSH and Thyroid Hormones : (3) Grave’s disease shows suppressed TSH levels with elevated total and unbound thyroid hormone levels. T3 toxicosis (elevated T3 with normal T4) occurs in 2-5% of cases or more in areas with borderline iodine intake. T4 toxicosis (elevated T4 with normal T3) can be seen with iodine-induced hyperthyroidism. Antibody Testing : (5) TPO antibodies or TRAb testing is useful for unclear cases but not routinely needed. Associated Abnormalities: Elevated bilirubin, liver enzymes, and ferritin. Microcytic anemia and thrombocytopenia may occur. Radionuclide scan and uptake (1) (e.g., 99mTc, 123I) differentiate Grave’s disease from thyroiditis, ectopic thyroid tissue, factitious thyrotoxicosis, toxic adenoma, or multinodular goiter. Color-Flow Doppler Ultrasonography (4): Differentiates hyperthyroidism (increased blood flow) from destructive thyroiditis. Treatment: Antithyroid drugs: Propylthiouracil (provide symptomatic relief) Radioiodine treatment (I131): Mainly used in elderly patients with surgical comorbidities or recurrence after surgery. Thyroidectomy: Treatment of choice, especially when other methods fail or are contraindicated. Reference: Harrison’s Principles of Internal Medicine, 21st Edition, Page 2938-2942",

This results in decreased production of T3 and T4 hormones. As a compensatory mechanism, the pituitary gland releases more TSH to stimulate the thyroid gland, causing increased TSH levels. Primary vs Secondary Hypothyroidism: Feature Primary Hypothyroidism Secondary Hypothyroidism Definition Thyroid gland dysfunction leads to inadequate thyroid hormone production Pituitary dysfunction leads to insufficient TSH secretion Causes Autoimmune (Hashimoto's thyroiditis) Iatrogenic (e.g., post-thyroidectomy, radiation) Iodine deficiency Medications (e.g., amiodarone, lithium) Infiltrative diseases (e.g., sarcoidosis) Food goitrogen → Cabbage, cassava.

While Pituitary Adenoma (Option B) can cause various hormonal imbalances, such as excessive production of prolactin (leading to hyperprolactinemia), it does not typically result in increased TSH and low T4 levels. In Grave's disease (Option C), TSH levels are typically decreased due to the negative feedback mechanism resulting from high levels of thyroid hormones Reference: Harrison’s Principles of Internal Medicine, 21st edition, Page 2933",

        "D": "Insulin bolus of 0.1 units/kg given"
      },

      "explanation": "Correct Answer C - Arterial blood gas The child’s presentation with confusion, tachypnea (Kussmaul respirations), dry mucous membranes, hypotension, hyperglycemia, and positive urine ketones strongly points to diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) . The next step is an arterial blood gas (ABG) to assess the severity of acidosis and guide management. Diabetic Ketoacidosis (DKA): Is a hyperglycemic emergency characterized primarily by a triad of hyperglycemia, ketosis, and anion gap metabolic acidosis. Serious complication of type 1 diabetes mellitus. Clinical Features: Symptoms Signs Nausea, vomiting Abdominal pain Shortness of breath Thirst, polyuria Weight loss Weakness Leg cramps Blurred vision Tachycardia Dehydration Hypotension (postural or supine) Tachypnea Kussmaul respirations (air hunger) Smell of acetone Respiratory distress Hypothermia Cold extremities/peripheral cyanosis Abdominal tenderness (may resemble acute pancreatitis or surgical abdomen) Lethargy/obtundation/cerebral oedema/possibly coma Investigations of DKA: Urine ketostix: Detects acetoacetate and acetate , but cannot detect ß-hydroxybutyrate. Serum ß-hydroxybutyrate: Produced three times more than acetoacetate and is preferred for accurate diagnosis of DKA. Random Blood Sugar: 250 - 600 mg/dL Serum electrolytes: Potassium: Total body potassium deficiency of 3-6 mEq/kg in DKA occurs due to osmotic diuresis and vomiting. Insulin shifts potassium intracellularly, lowering serum levels, and potassium correction with IV potassium chloride (KCl) should be done. Sodium: Serum sodium is reduced due to hyperglycemia: 1.6 meq/L reduction in sodium per 100 mg/dL rise in serum glucose. Dilutional hyponatremia is common due to water driven into the intravascular space from inside cells. Renal function test: Elevated blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and creatinine. Arterial blood gas (ABG) analysis: pH: 6.8-7.3 pCO2: 20-30 mmHg HCO3: <18 meq/L Anion gap: Increased Indicates DKA causes High anion gap metabolic acidosis. Serum amylase and lipase: High Total leukocyte count: Increased Phosphorus and magnesium levels: Reduced, but not accurately shown due to hypovolemia and hyperglycemia. 2-3 L of normal saline over 1-3 hours (Option A): Fluid resuscitation is essential in DKA, but without knowing the acid-base status through an ABG, it is not appropriate to start fluid therapy blindly. The ABG will guide the volume and rate of fluid administration based on the patient’s acidosis and hydration status. Insulin infusion at 0.1 units/kg/hour (Option B): Insulin therapy is critical, but it should be initiated after evaluating the patient’s acid-base status through an ABG. Correcting fluid and electrolyte imbalances is essential before starting insulin to avoid complications like hypokalemia and worsening dehydration. Insulin bolus of 0.1 units/kg (Option D): While insulin is needed, a bolus should not be given without first assessing the acid-base status and correcting fluid and electrolyte imbalances.",

Hypothyroidism due to disease in the pituitary (Option B): In pituitary hypothyroidism, TSH would be low due to the lack of pituitary secretion. However, unlike the hypothalamic case, TSH would not increase after TRH administration because the pituitary is unable to respond to TRH. Hyperthyroidism due to disease in the hypothalamus (Option D): In hypothalamic hyperthyroidism, there would be a lack of feedback inhibition on the hypothalamus and pituitary, leading to elevated TSH and thyroid hormones.

The classic ‘rule of tens’ is 10% bilateral, 10% extra-adrenal (Paragangliomas), and 10% metastatic. It is not used nowadays. Etiopathogenesis These tumors can be benign or malignant and are frequently associated with familial syndromes like Neurofibromatosis type 1, multiple endocrine neoplasia type II, and Von-Hippel Lindau disease. Catecholamines are produced in the chromaffin cells starting with the rate-limiting step of tyrosine hydroxylase (TH), regulating the conversion of tyrosine to dihydroxyphenylalanine (DOPA). Pheochromocytomas release these catecholamines in various patterns ranging from paroxysmal, continuous, and mixed patterns. Norepinephrine is released continuously and can result in persistent hypertension, while epinephrine is released in a paroxysmal pattern resulting in tachyarrhythmias. Ryanodine-2 receptors (RyR2). Beta-2 adrenoceptors Alpha(1)-adrenoreceptors Histopathology Histology of the lesion characteristically shows zellballen nests of chromaffin cells with strong positivity to chromogranin, synaptophysin, CD56, and focally to S100. The presence of chromaffin cells in the extra-adrenal tissue is the only pathognomonic characteristic of the malignant form of the entity. Clinical features Classical triad Episode of palpitation Headache Profuse sweating The dominant sign is Hypertension Tachycardia Anxiety Subcutaneous neurofibromas Cafe-au-lait macules Thyroid mass Axillary freckling Lisch nodules on the iris Retinal angiomas Abdominal mass Diagnosis Diagnosis of pheochromocytoma can be established by biochemical confirmation of hypersecretion of metanephrines and catecholamines. 24-hour urine test Catecholamines Fractionated metanephrines Total metanephrines Imaging : CT scan of the abdomen and pelvis to locate the tumour. 18F-FDG PET scanning is recommended for metastatic disease. MIBG scintigraphy Somatostatin receptor scintigraphy Gallium DOTATATE PET scanning Differential Diagnosis Hyperthyroidism Renal artery stenosis Hyperaldosteronism Cardiomyopathy Postural tachycardia syndrome (POTS) Treatment The definitive treatment of pheochromocytoma is surgical resection. Preoperative preparation of the patient has to be considered, and blood pressure should be consistently < 160/90 mm Hg. Blood pressure is controlled by alpha-adrenergic blockers(phenoxybenzamine 0.5-4 mg/kg of body weight) Oral Prazosin or IV phentolamine can be used to control paroxysm. Unilateral Pheochromocytoma: Minimally invasive adrenalectomy: Preferred treatment for most unilateral adrenal pheochromocytomas. Open adrenalectomy Bilateral pheochromocytomas: Bilateral total adrenalectomy is associated with a lifelong need for steroid replacement with long-term side effects.",

The symptoms, including palpitations, sweating, restlessness, and sweaty palms, are common in hyperthyroid states. The diagnostic finding in Graves' disease is elevated thyroid receptor antibodies. These antibodies, specifically thyroid-stimulating immunoglobulins (TSI), stimulate the thyroid gland, leading to excess production of thyroid hormones, resulting in hyperthyroid symptoms. Graves' Disease is an autoimmune disorder causing hyperthyroidism due to thyroid-stimulating immunoglobulins (TSI) that stimulate the thyroid gland, increasing hormone production (T3 and T4). Clinical Features: Hyperthyroid symptoms: Palpitations, sweating, restlessness, weight loss, heat intolerance, tachycardia, hyperactivity, irritability. Graves' ophthalmopathy: Exophthalmos, lid retraction, lid lag, conjunctival injection, dry eyes, visual disturbances. Diagnosis: Elevated TSI and thyroid function tests showing elevated T3/T4 and suppressed TSH. Radioactive iodine uptake: Increased in Graves' disease. Management: Antithyroid drugs: Propylthiouracil (PTU) or methimazole to inhibit thyroid hormone production. Radioactive iodine (RAI): Ablates overactive thyroid tissue but does not treat ophthalmopathy. Surgical treatment: Thyroidectomy if needed for large goiters or refractory cases.

At this stage, there is insufficient insulin production to maintain normal glucose levels, causing hyperglycemia, which characterizes dysglycemia. Incorrect Options: Option A - Autoimmune positive + normoglycemia: This situation is typically seen in the early stages of type 1 diabetes (Stage 1), where there is an autoimmune response against beta cells, but blood glucose levels remain normal because there is still enough insulin production to maintain glucose homeostasis. Option B - Autoimmune negative + normoglycemia: This scenario is not associated with type 1 diabetes. In type 1 diabetes, the autoimmune process is the hallmark feature. If there are no autoimmune markers (autoantibodies), it suggests that type 1 diabetes is unlikely. Normoglycemia in such a context would also not indicate any beta cell damage typical of type 1 diabetes.

      "explanation": "Correct Answer: D) Empagliflozin Explanation: Empagliflozin belongs to the class of SGLT-2 inhibitors that work by blocking sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 in the proximal convoluted tubules of the nephron. This mechanism prevents the reabsorption of glucose and sodium back into the bloodstream, leading to glucosuria. The drug provides multiple benefits including reduced progression of chronic kidney disease, diuretic effects through sodium loss, and blood pressure reduction of 3-6 mmHg.

It does not cause glucosuria as its mechanism of action is focused on increasing insulin secretion. Exenatide (Option B): This GLP-1 receptor agonist binds to GLP-1 receptor in pancreatic beta-cells in turn increasing insulin secretion and suppressing glucagon secretion. Its actions include delayed gastric emptying, induces early satiety (weight loss) & stabilizes atherosclerotic plaque (reduction in cardiovascular mortality). Its mechanism does not involve renal glucose reabsorption thus does not cause glucosuria. Acarbose (Option C) : This alpha-glucosidase inhibitor works by controlling post-prandial glucose spikes through reduced carbohydrate absorption in the intestine. It may cause abdominal bloating and diarrhea but does not affect renal glucose handling or cause glucosuria. Reference: Harrison's Principles of Internal Medicine, 21st Edition, Page 3110- 3113",

      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: B) Metabolic acidosis Explanation: Metabolic acidosis is not a feature of Conn's syndrome. Conn's syndrome, also known as primary hyperaldosteronism , is characterized by autonomous aldosterone production from the adrenal glands. The condition leads to increased sodium reabsorption and potassium excretion in the distal tubules. It is characterized by Hypertension, Hypokalemia and Metabolic Alkalosis (leading to muscle cramps). The pathophysiology involves excess aldosterone stimulating the ENaC channel , resulting in increased sodium and water reabsorption while promoting urinary loss of potassium and hydrogen ions. Conn Syndrome / Primary Hyperaldosteronism Definition Primary hyperaldosteronism characterized by excessive aldosterone secretion from adrenal glands with suppressed plasma renin Epidemiology Most common cause of secondary hypertension (6-20% of adult hypertensive patients) Higher prevalence in resistant hypertension (up to 30%) 2x more common in women Etiology Aldosterone-producing adenoma (50-60%) Bilateral idiopathic adrenal hyperplasia Aldosterone-producing adrenal carcinoma (1%) Familial hyperaldosteronism (Types 1-3) Pathophysiology ↑ Aldosterone → ↑ Na+ reabsorption → plasma volume expansion ↑ K+ excretion → hypokalemia Can lead to tissue inflammation and fibrosis in heart, kidneys, vasculature Clinical Features Resistant hypertension Muscle weakness/cramping Fatigue Headaches Polydipsia/polyuria NO edema (due to spontaneous natriuresis) Lab Findings ↓ K+ (can be normal in up to 38%) ↑ Na+ Metabolic alkalosis ↑ Urinary K+ excretion (>30 mmol/day) Suppressed plasma renin ↑ Aldosterone-to-renin ratio (ARR) Diagnostic Criteria Initial screening: ARR >40 Confirmatory tests: Salt loading test Fludrocortisone suppression test Captopril suppression test Imaging: CT scan for adenoma Adrenal venous sampling for lateralization Treatment Adenoma: Laparoscopic adrenalectomy Bilateral hyperplasia: Medical management Medical options: Spironolactone (first-line) Eplerenone Amiloride Prognosis Surgery: 30-60% cure rate for adenomas High morbidity/mortality if untreated May need long-term BP monitoring High-Yield Associations Normal K+ doesn't exclude diagnosis No edema despite hyperaldosteronism Screen all resistant hypertension cases Metabolic alkalosis (Option A) is a characteristic feature of Conn's syndrome. This occurs due to increased urinary loss of hydrogen ions and bicarbonate retention, leading to alkalosis. Metabolic alkalosis is actually one of the hallmark features of this condition. Hypertension (Option C) is a primary manifestation of Conn's syndrome. This develops due to increased sodium and water reabsorption leading to volume expansion. The increased blood volume and sodium retention directly contribute to elevated blood pressure. Muscle cramps (Option D) are commonly seen in patients with Conn's syndrome. These occur due to hypokalemia. The low potassium levels affect muscle function and can lead to weakness, fatigue, and cramping.

      "correct_answer": "D",
      "explanation": "in diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) but isn't part of diagnostic criteria. In DKA, patients are often potassium-depleted, yet plasma potassium levels may not fully indicate a total deficit. Initially, levels might even be elevated due to factors like water loss and potassium shifting. However, treatment can lead to a rapid drop in plasma potassium due to fluid dilution, insulin-induced movement into cells, and ongoing renal loss. Incorrect Options: Option A - Serum glucose of more than 250 mg: Serum glucose above 250 mg/dL is a diagnostic criterion for DKA. This leads to osmotic diuresis, causing dehydration and electrolyte loss, especially sodium and potassium. Option B - Anion gap of more than 10-12: An anion gap above 10-12 is a diagnostic criterion for DKA. It occurs because bicarbonate is replaced by β -hydroxybutyric acid and acetoacetic acid, reducing the sum of bicarbonate and chloride concentrations and raising the anion gap. Option C - Serum potassium less than 3.5 mEq: Serum bicarbonate below 15 mmol/L is a diagnostic criterion for DKA. Ketosis causes blood ketone accumulation, resulting in metabolic acidosis. This shift forces hydrogen ions into cells, displacing potassium ions.",

      },
      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: A) Glycosylated Hemoglobin Explanation: Glycosylated Hemoglobin (HbA1c) is the gold standard for monitoring long-term glycemic control in diabetic patients . This test provides a reliable measure of average blood glucose levels over the preceding 2-3 months, corresponding to the lifespan of red blood cells. HbA1c testing is particularly valuable because it is not affected by daily fluctuations in blood glucose levels and does not require fasting . The test measures the percentage of hemoglobin molecules that have glucose attached to them, providing a more stable and accurate reflection of overall glycemic control. It provides a more comprehensive view of glucose levels compared to other tests, with a diagnostic threshold of ≥ 48 mmol/mol (6.5%), making it ideal for early detection, particularly in patients with risk factors like obesity and family history. HbA1c evaluation: < 5.7% : Normal 5.7% - 6.5% : Pre-diabetic > 6.5% : Diabetic Other Investigations for Diabetes Mellitus: Blood Glucose Tests: Fasting Plasma Glucose (FPG) Measures glucose after an overnight fast. Diagnostic threshold: ≥ 126 mg/dL (7.0 mmol/L). Simple, cost-effective, and widely available. Random Plasma Glucose (RPG) Measures glucose at any time, irrespective of meals. Diagnostic threshold: ≥ 200 mg/dL (11.1 mmol/L). Useful for immediate diagnosis in symptomatic patients. Oral Glucose Tolerance Test (OGTT) Fasting glucose was measured, followed by a 75 g glucose drink, then re-measured after 2 hours. Diagnostic threshold: ≥ 200 mg/dL (11.1 mmol/L). More time-consuming; identifies impaired glucose tolerance. Glycated Albumin (Option B) measurement reflects average blood glucose levels over only 2-3 weeks due to albumin's shorter half-life of approximately 20 days. While useful for short-term monitoring, it doesn't provide the comprehensive long-term assessment that HbA1c offers. Serum Fructosamine (Option C) testing, similar to glycated albumin, provides information about glycemic control over the previous 2-3 weeks. This test measures glycated plasma proteins and is sometimes used when HbA1c results may be unreliable, such as in patients with hemoglobinopathies. Urine Sugar (Option D) testing is not reliable for assessing long-term glucose control as it is influenced by multiple factors including renal threshold, hydration status, and concurrent medications. Urine glucose appears only when blood glucose exceeds the renal threshold, making it an inadequate measure of overall glycemic control.

        "D": "Propylthiouracil"
      },
      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer A - Diltiazem The given clinical scenario suggests the diagnosis of thyroid storm (or thyroid crisis), a life-threatening complication of hyperthyroidism. The patient's symptoms, including severe restlessness, palpitations, tremors, tachycardia, atrial fibrillation, and a swollen neck, are consistent with thyroid storm. The immediate priority is to control the heart rate due to the atrial fibrillation and high risk of complications such as heart failure. In thyroid storm, beta-blockers like propranolol or esmolol are often used for rate control; however, they are contraindicated in patients with asthma due to the risk of bronchospasm (Options B and C ruled out). Instead, diltiazem, a calcium channel blocker, is the preferred option for rate control in this patient, as it does not have the bronchoconstrictive effects of beta-blockers. Thyrotoxic crisis / Thyroid storm Thyrotoxic crisis or thyroid storm It is a life-threatening exacerbation of hyperthyroidism Clinical features Fever Delirium, seizures, coma Vomiting, diarrhea Jaundice Hyperthermia Cardiac failure Arrhythmias Precipitating factors Precipitating factors: Stress: Acute illnesses like stroke, trauma, diabetic ketoacidosis Surgery, commonly of the thyroid Infections Acute iodine load: Radioiodine treatment of a patient with partially or untreated hyperthyroidism Iodinated contrast agents Amiodarone administeration Treatment Management of the precipitating factors (digoxin, diuretics, & oxygen) IV fluids and ice pack Propylthiouracil (DOC) Methimazole/carbimazole Beta-blockers Corticosteroids Lugol’s iodine/ sodium ipodate Propylthiouracil (PTU) (Option D): Propylthiouracil is used to inhibit the synthesis of thyroid hormones in thyroid storm and is the drug of choice for the management of thyroid storm. However, it should be given only after the rate of atrial fibrillation is controlled, as the primary goal in the acute setting is to stabilize the patient and manage the arrhythmia.

        "D": "Thiazides for 2 weeks"
      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: B) DDAVP supplementation for lifelong This patient's clinical presentation and history are consistent with central diabetes insipidus (DI) , which results from insufficient vasopressin (antidiuretic hormone, ADH) secretion due to total hypophysectomy (removal of the pituitary gland). Key findings supporting this diagnosis include: Polyuria (excessive urination) and low urine osmolarity (200 mOsm/L) indicate dilute urine, characteristic of diabetes insipidus. Hypernatremia (Na I = 155 mEq/L) suggests dehydration, commonly seen in DI due to impaired water retention. Definitive management for central diabetes insipidus due to total hypophysectomy is lifelong desmopressin (DDAVP) supplementation. DDAVP is a synthetic analogue of vasopressin that helps reduce urine output and prevent dehydration. This treatment is required for the patient to manage the symptoms of DI and maintain fluid balance. DDAVP for 2 weeks and then discontinue (Option A): This is not appropriate for complete hypophysectomy, where the deficiency of vasopressin is permanent. Short-term DDAVP would only be used in cases where the deficiency is transient (e.g., partial hypophysectomy). Upsetting of receptors, so no treatment required (Option C): In central diabetes insipidus, the issue is the lack of vasopressin, not receptor dysfunction. Without treatment, the patient would experience chronic dehydration and electrolyte imbalances. Thiazides for 2 weeks (Option D): Thiazide diuretics may be used in nephrogenic diabetes insipidus (due to kidney resistance to ADH), but they are not effective in central DI, where the problem lies in vasopressin production, not renal response.

Patients with DKA are typically dehydrated due to excessive urination and vomiting, and they also lose potassium in the urine. Hypokalemia (low potassium levels) can occur due to insulin therapy, so it is important to check and monitor potassium levels closely during treatment. Incorrect Choices: Option A - IV insulin drip is a necessary treatment for DKA. Still, it should be initiated after fluid resuscitation to avoid causing a sudden drop in blood glucose levels, which can lead to cerebral edema. Option B - IV soda-bicarbonate is not recommended for the initial management of DKA as it may worsen the acidosis by causing a shift in the acid-base balance. Option C - While checking blood ketone levels is important for diagnosing DKA, it does not address the acute management of the condition. Reference: .",

Propylthiouracil (PTU) is an antithyroid drug that works by inhibiting the production of thyroid hormones. PTU is the preferred drug for use during early pregnancy, particularly in the first trimester, as it has a lower risk of causing birth defects compared to Methimazole. Incorrect choices: Option B - Methimazole is also an antithyroid drug that works by inhibiting the production of thyroid hormones. Methimazole is usually avoided during the first trimester of pregnancy due to its potential risk of causing birth defects. However, it can be used during the second and third trimesters of pregnancy if PTU is not well-tolerated. Option C - Carbimazole is a prodrug of Methimazole. Like Methimazole, it is avoided during the first trimester of pregnancy due to the risk of causing birth defects. Option D - Propylthiouracil can be used in early gestation, but Methimazole and Carbimazole are avoided during the first trimester of the pregnancy.
