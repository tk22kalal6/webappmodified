      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: C) Nimodipine Explanation: Nimodipine is used to prevent delayed ischemia in the acute phase of subarachnoid hemorrhage. Subarachnoid hemorrhage management: Nimodipine 30–60 mg IV for 5–14 days, followed by 360 mg orally for 7 days. Prevents delayed ischemia in the acute phase of SAH. Aneurysm Management Endovascular coiling Surgical clipping Arteriovenous malformation Management Surgical removal. Ligation of feeding or draining blood vessels. Injection of material to occlude fistula or draining veins. Complications Treatment Obstructive hydrocephalus: May need shunt drainage. Delayed cerebral ischaemia (vasospasm): Treated with vasodilators. Hyponatraemia: Managed by fluid restriction. Systemic complications (immobility): Manage chest infections and venous thrombosis. Nifedipine (Option A): It does not cross the blood-brain barrier effectively and is not used to prevent cerebral vasospasm or delayed ischemia in subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH). Amlodipine (Option B): Long-acting calcium channel blocker used for systemic hypertension and angina. Like nifedipine, it lacks specificity for cerebral vessels and is not effective in preventing delayed cerebral ischemia after SAH. Felodipine (Option D): Dihydropyridine calcium channel blocker used in managing hypertension, but it has no proven benefit in preventing cerebral vasospasm or ischemia post-SAH.

      "explanation": "noted with poorly localized, burning pain and spared sensation in the perineal and sacral areas) indicate intramedullary compression of the spinal cord. Intramedullary compression of the spinal cord: Pressure exerted on the spinal cord from within typically due to a lesion such as a tumor, abscess or other pathologies. Causes Intramedullary Tumors: Ependymomas Astrocytomas Hemangioblastomas Abscesses (pyogenic or tuberculous abscesses) can create masses within the spinal cord. Multiple sclerosis: Inflammatory demyelinating lesions may cause intramedullary effects. Trauma Cystic lesions : Such as syringomyelia, where a cyst forms within the spinal cord. Clinical features Motor Symptoms: Weakness or paralysis in the limbs, typically presenting as bilateral weakness. Reflex Changes: Hyperreflexia and spasticity below the level of the lesion. Pain: Poorly localized, burning pain and spared sensation in the perineal and sacral areas(sacral sparing). Diagnosis MRI of the Spine: The gold standard for identifying intramedullary lesions . CT Scan Neurological Examination: Detailed assessment to identify the level and extent of dysfunction. Extradural compression (Option A) and Intradural compression (Option B): Both are extramedullary compression of the spinal cord which usually presents with radicular pain and sacral sensory loss. Foramen Magnum syndrome (Option C): Usually presents with crural paresis and does not present with poorly localized burning pain.",

This patient’s rapid, symmetrical onset of symptoms and the absence of other characteristic findings like Optic neuritis, Lhermitte sign, Uhthoff’s phenomenon , MRI shows characteristic Dawson’s fingers and CSF analysis reveals Oligoclonal bands - thereby making MS less likely. Guillain-Barré syndrome (Option B): GBS often presents with ascending asymmetric weakness and areflexia , affecting peripheral nerves. CSF analysis reveals Albumino-cytological dissociation. However, this patient has hyperreflexia and sensory loss in a well-defined spinal cord region, which is more indicative of central nervous system pathology, ruling out GBS. Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) (Option D): ALS causes progressive motor neuron degeneration, leading to both upper and lower motor neuron signs without sensory deficits . The acute onset, sensory involvement, and bladder dysfunction are not typical of ALS. Reference: https://www.ninds.nih.gov/health-information/disorders/transverse-myelitis",

      "question": "Which gene mutation is primarily associated with hyperkalemic periodic paralysis?",
      "options": {
        "A": "KCNJ2",
        "B": "CACNA1S",
        "C": "SCN4A",
        "D": "RYR1"
      },
      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: C) SCN4A Explanation: Mutations in the SCN4A gene , which encodes a sodium channel, are primarily responsible for hyperkalemic periodic paralysis. Hyperkalemic periodic paralysis Periodic paralysis is a group of inherited diseases that present as episodic muscle weakness and paralysis. Begins in childhood and can continue until middle adulthood or may even last into late adulthood. Etiopathogenesis : It is caused by a point mutation in the SCN4A gene. This gene encodes proteins responsible for sodium transport in skeletal muscles. Mutant SCN4A protein channels malfunction by allowing too much sodium into skeletal muscles by staying open too long or not staying closed long enough. This additional influx of sodium triggers a release of intracellular potassium from the skeletal muscles. Subsequently, this change in ion transport impairs a muscle's ability to contract, leading to weakness or paralysis. Clinical features: Patients typically present in the first or second decade of life with intermittent bouts of weakness or paralysis in the hips, shoulders, and back triggered by diet, stress, or exercise. Attacks are generally intermittent and last 15 minutes to 1 hour. Common triggers are potassium-rich foods, a cold environment, and rest after physical activity. Diagnosis : Diagnostic criteria are as follows: 2 or more attacks of weakness with serum potassium greater than 4.5 mEq/L or 1 attack in the patient with a relative with 1 attack with serum potassium greater than 4.5 mEq/L. 3 of the 6 following clinical or laboratory features can also assist in making a diagnosis: Symptom onset before age 30 Attacks must last less than 2 hours Identifiable triggers, myotonia Family history Confirmed genetic testing for sodium channel mutation in the SCN4A Positive McManis short exercise test. Treatment: The treatment approach should include both the management of acute attacks and the prevention of attacks. Individuals may prevent attacks by consuming frequent carbohydrate-rich meals, a thiazide diuretic, or a carbonic anhydrase inhibitor (Acetazolamide). Individuals should avoid potassium-rich medications and foods, fasting, strenuous work, and exposure to cold to prevent attacks. Prophylactic treatment necessitates serum potassium levels twice yearly to avoid diuretic complications and annual evaluation of thyroid function. KCNJ2 (Option A): Associated with Anderson-Tawil syndrome and hypokalemic periodic paralysis. CACNA1S (Option B): Mutations in this gene are linked to hypokalemic periodic paralysis and other channelopathies. RYR1 (Option D): Mutations in this gene are associated with malignant hyperthermia and central core disease. Reference: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK564319/",

      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: B) Lumbar puncture (LP) to assess for xanthochromia Explanation: Lumbar puncture (LP) to assess for xanthochromia is the next step if the initial CT scan is negative but clinical suspicion for SAH remains high. Ideally, the LP should be performed at least 6 hours after the headache onset to detect xanthochromia, which indicates blood breakdown in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). Initial Evaluation of Suspected Subarachnoid Hemorrhage (SAH) Head CT: First-line imaging to detect SAH. CT Angiography : Performed if SAH is identified on CT to determine the a neurysm's location and size. If negative, follow with cerebral angiography (Option C ruled out) or digital subtraction angiography (DSA). TOF-MRA (Time-of-Flight Magnetic Resonance Angiography): A non-contrast imaging option, suitable for patients allergic to contrast or with reduced kidney function . (Option D ruled out) Lumbar Puncture (LP): Done if the initial CT is negative but suspicion remains high. Ideally performed 6 hours after the CT to detect xanthochromia (yellow discoloration in cerebrospinal fluid). Xanthochromia is often visible at the bedside. Sensitivity Considerations: CT Scans and RBC Counts : Highly sensitive early in diagnosis but decrease over time due to the fast flow of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). (Option A ruled out) RBC Lysis: RBCs in the CSF break down over time, producing bilirubin and oxyhemoglobin, making xanthochromia more detectable after several hours. Diagnostic Protocols Lumbar Puncture Before Imaging: Only if CT is unavailable. Four-Vessel Conventional X-ray Angiography: Typically performed to localize the aneurysm and check for additional unruptured aneurysms. Endovascular Treatment: In some centers, endovascular techniques are performed during the angiogram to minimize invasive procedures. CT Angiography: An alternative for aneurysm localization and treatment planning.",

      "explanation": "Correct Answer: D) Hyponatremia due to cerebral salt-wasting syndrome Explanation : Hyponatremia occurs in the first two weeks after SAH due to cerebral salt-wasting syndrome, leading to volume depletion and mental status changes, as seen in this patient. Subarachnoid hemorrhage- Delayed neurological deficits Rerupture Incidence: ~30% in the first month, with peak in the first 7 days. Mortality rate: 50%. Prevention: Early treatment eliminates risk. Hydrocephalus Acute Hydrocephalus : Causes stupor/coma; managed by external ventricular drain. Subacute Hydrocephalus: Develops over days/weeks; causes drowsiness, slowed thinking, and incontinence. Diagnosed via CT, CTA, TCD ultrasound, or x-ray angiography. (Option B ruled out) Chronic Hydrocephalus : Weeks/months after SAH, with symptoms like gait difficulty, incontinence, or cognitive impairment. Delayed Cerebral Ischemia (DCI) (Option C ruled out) Cause: Vasospasm of arteries at the brain’s base, causing ischemia and infarction (~30% of patients). Onset: 4–14 days after hemorrhage (peaks at 7 days). Mechanism: Triggered by blood clots/ breakdown products. More surrounding blood increases vasospasm risk. Symptoms : Sudden focal deficits, mental decline, fluctuating symptoms . Detection: X-ray angiography, TCD ultrasound, or CTA. Treatment: CSF drainage, mannitol/ hypertonic saline, hemicraniectomy, moderate hypothermia. Hyponatremia Onset: Occurs in the first 2 weeks post-SAH due to natriuresis and volume depletion (hyponatremia + hypovolemia). Cause: Involves atrial and brain natriuretic peptides (cerebral salt-wasting syndrome). Treatment: Resolves in 1–2 weeks. Free-water restriction is avoided to reduce stroke risk. Rebleeding of the aneurysm (Option A): It usually causes acute neurological deterioration with signs of intracranial pressure elevation, such as rapid onset coma, which is not consistent with this patient's gradual decline in consciousness.

Ruptured Aneurysms Sudden ICP increase: Occurs at the moment of rupture, often causing transient loss of consciousness in nearly 50% of patients. Headache : Excruciating headaches may precede before the rupture, but most patients report severe headache after regaining consciousness. The primary symptom is a sudden severe headache during exertion, often described as \"the worst headache of my life\". Some cases may present with moderate headache or changes in usual headache patterns. Additional Symptoms: Generalized headache with neck stiffness and vomiting is common. Focal Neurologic Deficits: May occur if the aneurysm bleeds into the brain or subdural space, causing a hematoma. Deficits include: Hemiparesis, aphasia, mental slowness (abulia). Severe Cases: 10% of patients may lose consciousness for several days due to significant bleeding. Sentinel Bleeds: Small, earlier ruptures causing unexplained headache can precede major SAH, signaling imminent hemorrhage.

      "explanation": "Correct Answer: D) All the above Explanation : Each of the factors listed contributes significantly to an increased risk of aneurysm rupture. Subarachnoid hemorrhage Subarachnoid Hemorrhage (SAH): Blood accumulation in the subarachnoid space. Causes: Often due to aneurysm rupture (~85%) or trauma . Non-traumatic SAH is most commonly caused by the rupture of a saccular aneurysm . Clinical Impact: High mortality and morbidity; often presents with a sudden, severe headache (worst headache of life). Complications: Seizures, vasospasm, hydrocephalus, and delayed cerebral ischemia (DCI). Epidemiology: Age/ Gender: Most of the SAH occurs between age of 40-60, mean rupture age 50-55 and slightly more prevalent in females. Risk Factors: Smoking and history of ruptured aneurysms increase SAH risk. Etiology: Aneurysmal SAH (aSAH): Risk Factors: Hypertension , smoking , family history, alcohol use, sympathomimetic drugs , and estrogen deficiency . Rupture Risk: (Option D) Age >60 Posterior circulation aneurysms Atherosclerosis Aneurysm size Aneurysms <10 mm: ~0.1% annual rupture risk. Aneurysms ≥ 10 mm: 0.5–1% annual rupture risk. Giant aneurysms (>2.5 cm): ~6% rupture risk in first year. Family history Previous SAH ADPKD Nonaneurysmal SAH (NASAH): Perimesencephalic NASAH : Localized blood in perimesencephalic cisterns, normal angiography, benign course. Occult Aneurysm : Small aneurysms missed on initial angiography, detectable on repeat imaging. Vascular Malformations: Includes arteriovenous malformations (AVM) and dural arteriovenous fistulae. Treated with surgery or endovascular interventions. Intracranial Arterial Dissection: Diagnosed by angiography, causes severe bleeding, treated with surgery or endovascular methods. Other Causes: Cocaine abuse, cerebral amyloid angiopathy, cerebral venous thrombosis, sickle cell disorders, moyamoya disease, cerebral vasculitis, bleeding disorders. Pathophysiology: Hemodynamic Stress : Central to intracranial aneurysm formation, especially at arterial bifurcations. Aneurysm Rupture: Causes neurological damage through compression of adjacent brain tissue and ischemia from reduced blood flow. Mechanisms: Hemodynamic stress and inflammation (matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-mediated degradation of extracellular matrix) weaken the arterial wall, promoting aneurysm formation and rupture. Inflammatory Response: Macrophages and smooth muscle cells drive these degenerative processes.",

      "explanation": "Correct Answer: B) Potassium channelopathy affecting skeletal muscle and cardiac conduction Anderson-Tawil syndrome, which is caused by mutations in the KCNJ2 gene. Anderson-Tawil Syndrome (ATS) Etiopathogenesis : Anderson-Tawil syndrome is a rare autosomal dominant disorder, part of the spectrum of channelopathies, specifically a type of periodic paralysis. The syndrome is caused by mutations in the KCNJ2 gene located on chromosome 17, which encodes the Kir 2.1 inward-rectifier potassium channel. This results in dysfunction of potassium ion flow, leading to both skeletal muscle and cardiac abnormalities. Mutation in the *KCNJ2* gene affects potassium channels in the heart, skeletal muscle, and smooth muscle. The potassium channel dysfunction leads to disruptions in cellular membrane polarization, manifesting as periodic muscle weakness, cardiac arrhythmias, and other symptoms. Clinical Features: The hallmark of Anderson-Tawil syndrome involves a triad of symptoms: Periodic paralysis Ventricular arrhythmias Prolonged QT interval Dysmorphic Features: Craniofacial abnormalities such as a broad forehead, small mandible, low-set ears, and hypertelorism (wide-spaced eyes). Skeletal abnormalities like short stature, scoliosis, and clinodactyly (curvature of fingers), syndactyly. Diagnosis: Diagnosis is based on a combination of clinical findings, genetic testing, and supportive investigations. Electrocardiogram (ECG): Identification of characteristic arrhythmias such as frequent PVCs or bidirectional ventricular tachycardia. Electromyography (EMG): EMG may show muscle fiber irritability during episodes of weakness. Serum Electrolytes: Monitoring of serum potassium levels during episodes of muscle weakness. Hypokalemia is often seen but normal or hyperkalemia can also occur. Genetic Testing: Testing for *KCNJ2* gene mutations confirm the diagnosis. Differential Diagnosis: Hypokalemic Periodic Paralysis Hyperkalemic Periodic Paralysis Thyrotoxic Periodic Paralysis Long QT syndrome Treatment : Potassium supplementation (20-30mEq/L): Oral potassium can help alleviate hypokalemic episodes. Carbonic anhydrase inhibitors (acetazolamide): These are used to prevent episodes of paralysis. They help stabilize muscle membrane potential. Avoidance of triggers: Maintaining stable potassium level, avoiding fasting, and reducing strenuous exercise can help reduce the frequency of attacks. Cardiac Management: Beta-blockers Implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) Antiarrhythmic drugs (flecainide, amiodarone)",

Hypokalemic Periodic Paralysis (HypoPP) It is a genetic disorder, caused by skeletal muscle ion channel mutation, mainly affecting sodium or calcium channels. The majority of hypoPP cases are hereditary or familial. The familial form of hypoPP is a rare channelopathy resulting from mutations in either the calcium or sodium ion channels, predominantly affecting skeletal muscle cells. Etiopathogenesis: Genetics : Autosomal dominant mutations in voltage-gated calcium channels ( CACNA1S ) or sodium channels ( SCN4A ). The most common familial form, type 1 hypoPP , is characterized by a mutation in the dihydropyridine-sensitive skeletal muscle calcium channel gene, CACNA1S. On the other hand, the type 2 familial form of hypoPP is associated with mutations in the voltage-sensitive skeletal muscle sodium channel gene, SCN4A . Mechanism : Abnormal ion channel function leads to impaired muscle cell depolarisation and muscle weakness during attacks. Mutation in the calcium channel revealed abnormal sarcolemmal ATP-sensitive K+ (KATP) channel function. This was supported by the lack of stimulation of the channel by magnesium adenosine diphosphate (MgADP), which is likely associated with depolarization during hypokalemia. Triggers : Common triggers: Carbohydrate-rich meals, strenuous exercise followed by rest, stress, and cold exposure. Clinical Features: The mean age of presentation of attacks is the first or second decade of life during teenage or childhood. Episodic weakness: Sudden onset of flaccid paralysis, typically affecting proximal muscles more than distal. Pattern : Weakness usually begins in the legs and progresses to the arms, sparing respiratory and ocular muscles. The pattern of muscle weakness is similar in both familial and thyrotoxic hypoPP, and signs of hyperthyroidism are often evident in most cases of thyrotoxic hypoPP. Hyporeflexia or Areflexia is a common finding. Muscle weakness between attacks that improves with mild exercise. Respiratory muscle involvement in severe cases. Diagnosis : HypoPP is suspected when an individual presents with a sudden attack of flaccid muscle weakness involving proximal muscles, accompanied by either decreased or normal deep tendon reflexes, especially after exposure to known triggering factors. However, without a family history, a low serum potassium level during a typical weakness episode helps establish the diagnosis. Serum potassium levels: Low during attacks (hypokalemia). ECG : May show U waves, prolonged QT interval, or arrhythmias during hypokalemia. Genetic testing : Identifies mutations in the CACNA1S or SCN4A genes.",

      "explanation": "Correct Answer: B) Paramyotonia Congenita Explanation: This patient presents with classic symptoms of Paramyotonia Congenita , which include muscle stiffness triggered by cold exposure and exacerbation with continued activity. Paramyotonia Congenita: Paramyotonia Congenita (PC) is a rare autosomal dominant disorder caused by mutations in the SCN4A gene located in the 17q chromosome , which encodes the alpha subunit of the voltage-gated sodium channels in skeletal muscle. Pathophysiology : Mutations in the SCN4A gene lead to defective sodium channels, resulting in impaired muscle membrane excitability. This causes prolonged depolarization of muscle cells and delayed relaxation, leading to muscle stiffness (myotonia). Triggers : The primary triggers for paramyotonia include cold exposure, repetitive activity . Clinical Features: Muscle Stiffness (Myotonia): Stiffness occurs after cold exposure, particularly affecting the facial muscles (eyelids, lips) and distal muscles (hands). Stiffness worsens with repeated movements (paradoxical myotonia) and improves with rest. Weakness : Temporary muscle weakness may follow the stiffness, especially after prolonged cold exposure or exercise. Cold Sensitivity: Patients often experience increased muscle stiffness when exposed to cold temperatures. Diagnosis : Clinical History and Examination: Diagnosis is often based on the patient’s symptoms, especially the cold-induced muscle stiffness and paradoxical worsening with repeated movements. Electromyography (EMG): EMG typically shows myotonic discharges (repetitive muscle action potentials) that persist with activity. Genetic Testing: Mutations in the SCN4A gene can confirm the diagnosis. Cold Test: Cooling specific muscles (forearm) can provoke symptoms of stiffness or weakness, aiding in diagnosis. Treatment : Avoid Cold Exposure: Patients should avoid cold environments to prevent symptoms. Gradual Warming : In cold environments, gradual warming may help reduce symptoms. Medications : Mexiletine : A sodium channel blocker that helps reduce myotonia by stabilizing the muscle membrane. Acetazolamide : It can help reduce muscle stiffness and prevent attacks. Physical Therapy: Regular gentle exercises may help maintain muscle function and avoid stiffness. Myotonic Dystrophy (Option A): Muscle stiffness with systemic features, not triggered by cold. Hypokalemic Periodic Paralysis (Option C): Episodes of weakness, not stiffness, triggered by low potassium. Becker Muscular Dystrophy (Option D): Progressive muscle weakness, not cold-triggered stiffness. Reference: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/medgen/113142",
