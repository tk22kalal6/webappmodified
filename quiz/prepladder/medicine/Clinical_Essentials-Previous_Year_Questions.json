      "question": "Which of the following indicators may be observed when using a small-sized blood pressure cuff?",
      "options": {
        "A": "False elevation of BP",
        "B": "Falsely low value of BP",
        "C": "Cancels the effects of calcified arteries",
        "D": "Increases trans arm impendance"
      },
      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "inaccurate measurements and false elevation of blood pressure. When the cuff size is too small for the patient's arm, it can result in increased resistance and inadequate compression of the underlying artery, leading to an overestimation of the blood pressure reading. Incorrect options: Option B: Falsely low value of BP: It is incorrect because using a small-size BP cuff would typically result in a false elevation of blood pressure, not a falsely low value. Option C: Cancels the effects of calcified arteries: It is incorrect because using a small-size BP cuff does not cancel the effects of calcified arteries. Calcified arteries may affect the accuracy of the blood pressure measurement, but using an appropriate cuff size is important for accurate readings. Option D: Increases trans arm impedance: It is incorrect because using a small-size BP cuff does not specifically increase trans arm impedance. Trans arm impedance refers to the resistance encountered when measuring blood pressure across the arm. Reference: HARRISON'S PRINCIPLES OF INTERNAL MEDICINE 20TH EDITION",

      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "antibodies.Blood transfusion reaction is an example of a type 2 hypersensitivity reaction Incorrect options: Option A (Hyperacute kidney rejection) is incorrect because hyperacute kidney rejection is a type of organ transplant rejection mediated by preformed antibodies. It is not a classic example of a type 2 hypersensitivity reaction. Option C (Arthus reaction) is incorrect because Arthus reaction is a localized immune complex-mediated hypersensitivity reaction that typically occurs at the site of antigen exposure, resulting in tissue damage and inflammation. Option D (Pathergy phenomenon) is incorrect because pathergy phenomenon refers to a hyperreactivity of the skin to minor trauma, commonly seen in conditions like Behcet's disease. It is not specific to type 2 hypersensitivity reactions. Reference: .",
