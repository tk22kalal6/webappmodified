      },
      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "descent of 1000 meters if symptoms occur. previous symptoms, which include fatigue, cough, and dyspnea. Effective prevention involves a slow ascent with a maximum altitude gain of 300 m per day and the primary treatment for symptoms is immediate descent of 1000 meters to alleviate hypoxia and reduce pulmonary edema. High altitude pulmonary edema Prevention Slow ascent is the most effective method of prevention, even for susceptible individuals. Graded ascent and adequate time for acclimatization. Low sleeping altitudes. Avoidance of alcohol and sleeping pills. Avoidance of vigorous exercise, especially during the first days at altitude. Nifedipine, a calcium channel blocker, can prevent HAPE in individuals with a history of the condition. The recommended dosage is 60 mg daily of a slow-release formulation, starting during ascent and continuing until the third or fourth day after arrival at the final altitude or after descending below 3000 m. Preliminary data suggest glucocorticoids may prevent HAPE when taken one day prior to ascent and continued during ascent at high altitude. Susceptible individuals should maintain an average altitude gain not exceeding 300 m per day above 2500 m. If progressive acclimatization is not possible, prophylaxis with nifedipine or tadalafil is recommended for long stays at high altitude, and dexamethasone for short stays of less than 5 days. Treatment The mainstay of treatment is to descend 1000 meters or until symptoms resolve. Minimize exertion during descent to reduce hypoxemia and worsening condition. Oxygen therapy may help alleviate symptoms if descent is delayed or difficult. Main treatment remains descent, regardless of oxygen availability. Supplemental oxygen via high-flow nasal cannula and facemask should be titrated to SpO2 greater than 90%. Portable hyperbaric chambers can be used if descent is not possible but require constant care. Hyperbaric chambers may be challenging for individuals with nausea, vomiting, claustrophobia, or altered mental status from AMS/HACE. There is a risk of symptom recurrence after exiting the hyperbaric chamber. Nifedipine can improve symptoms as an adjunct therapy by reducing pulmonary vasoconstriction. Nifedipine should not be the sole therapy if descent or oxygen is an option. Phosphodiesterase inhibitors may help decrease pulmonary artery and capillary pressure through vasodilation if nifedipine is unavailable. There is no clinically proven role for acetazolamide, β -agonists, or diuretics in the treatment of HAPE. Maintain an average altitude gain exceeding 300 m per day, and begin",

      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "defined as a drop in core body temperature below 28°C. This condition disrupts the body's ability to maintain homeostasis, leading to potential organ failure and life-threatening complications. Layering with wet clothing can exacerbate heat loss, as wet materials conduct heat away from the body more efficiently than dry materials. Effective treatment for hypothermia requires removing wet clothing and using dry insulation to help retain body heat. Treatment of Hypothermia: Initial Management: Focus on rapid rewarming, preventing heat loss, and ensuring airway, breathing, and circulation are managed. Clothing: Remove wet clothing and replace it with dry insulation immediately. Gentle Handling: Move moderate/severe hypothermic patients gently to avoid fatal arrhythmias due to cardiac irritability. Glucose: Administer oral glucose for patients with documented hypoglycemia. Rewarming Techniques: Passive External Rewarming (for mild hypothermia): Remove wet clothing and apply insulating layers. Shivering aids in heat generation, but requires glucose stores. Rate of rewarming: 0.5 to 2°C per hour. Active External Rewarming (for moderate to severe hypothermia or refractory mild cases): Use heated air units to reduce heat loss (e.g., warm air blankets). Apply heated packs to axillae, chest, and back. Water immersion (44-45°C) can be used but must be done with care due to risks of cold blood returning to circulation (increased cardiac load). Active Internal Rewarming (for severe hypothermia): Airway rewarming with humidified warm air. Warm intravenous (IV) fluids (40-42°C). (Option A ruled out) Warm saline lavage of body cavities (e.g., stomach, bladder, colon, peritoneum, pleura). (Option D ruled out) Pleural lavage: Insert two thoracostomy tubes (anterior and posterior) for warm fluid infusion and drainage. Peritoneal lavage: Insert multiple catheters, useful for trauma detection and rewarming. 4. Extracorporeal Rewarming: Hemodialysis: Most accessible, increases core temperature by 2-3°C per hour. Arteriovenous (AV) Rewarming: Warm femoral arterial blood flows to the contralateral femoral vein, raising temperature by 4.5°C per hour. Requires adequate blood pressure. Cardiopulmonary Bypass & ECMO (for cardiac arrest or hemodynamically unstable patients): (Option B ruled out) Most rapid rewarming methods (7-10°C per hour).

Exaplanation: This patient has hypothermia , characterized by a core body temperature of 29°C, leading to symptoms such as lethargy, dilated pupils, and bradycardia. This condition results from prolonged exposure to cold, affecting the body's ability to maintain normal temperature and function. Osborn (J) waves are often present in hypothermic patients and can indicate the severity of the condition. J waves seen in ECG Hypothermia Definition Hypothermia is defined as a drop in core body temperature below 35°C, resulting in the failure to maintain homeostasis and affecting all organ systems. Types Primary Hypothermia : Caused by environmental cold exposure, such as cold air or water. Common in cold geographic areas but can also occur in mild climates. Secondary Hypothermia : Results from conditions that impair heat production or increase heat loss (e.g., trauma, burns, drug overdoses, endocrine disorders, CNS injury, or drug effects). Clinical Features Mild Hypothermia (32-35°C / 90-95°F) (Option A) Symptoms: Hunger, nausea, fatigue, shivering, pale/dry skin, increased muscle tone, blood pressure, heart rate, and respiration. Neurologic symptoms: Cognitive decline, memory impairment, ataxia, dysarthria. Shivering may stop if energy stores are depleted (e.g., malnutrition). Cold-induced diuresis due to peripheral vasoconstriction. Moderate Hypothermia (28-32°C / 82-90°F) (Option B) Cognitive decline, lethargy, CNS depression (hyporeflexia, dilated pupils). Shivering stops at 30-32°C. Paradoxical undressing may occur. Increased risk of atrial fibrillation, hypotension, bradycardia, bradypnea. Severe Hypothermia (<28°C / <82°F) (Option C) Unresponsiveness, further decline in cerebral blood flow, hypotension, bradycardia, and cardiac output. Risk of atrial, junctional dysrhythmias. Pulmonary congestion, oliguria, and areflexia. Potential for cardiorespiratory failure and death. ECG Findings Atrial Fibrillation : Most common arrhythmia in hypothermic patients. Bradycardia : Seen in moderate to severe hypothermia, increasing the risk of ventricular arrhythmias. QT Interval Prolongation : Due to slowed impulse conduction through potassium channels. Osborn (J) Waves : Elevated J point, visible on ECG in the precordial leads, with wave height proportional to the degree of hypothermia.",

Two days after his arrival, he begins to experience increasing fatigue, a non-productive cough, and difficulty breathing during physical activity. His oxygen saturation is 60% on examination, and he exhibits tachypnea and cyanosis. Based on the scenario, which factors do not contribute to the patient's clinical features?",

        "C": "Recent heavy physical exertion prior to ascent",
        "D": "Extended acclimatization period before ascent"
      },
      "correct_answer": "D",
      "explanation": "characteristic of acute HAPE, a severe form of altitude sickness resulting from hypoxia and noncardiogenic pulmonary edema. An extended acclimatization period is protective against altitude sickness. It allows the body to adjust to lower oxygen levels gradually, thereby reducing the risk of developing HAPE (High altitude pulmonary edema). High altitude pulmonary edema About HAPE is a severe, high-altitude illness, potentially fatal. It is noncardiogenic pulmonary edema caused by hypoxia. It occurs above 2500 meters, and can start as low as 2000 meters. Risk factors: low hypoxic ventilatory response (HVR), rapid ascent, male sex, sleep medications, high salt intake, cold temperatures, and heavy exertion. Pre-existing conditions (e.g., pulmonary hypertension) increase risk. Faster ascent correlates with higher incidence. Pathophysiology HAPE results from the pulmonary vasculature's response to hypoxia. Hypoxic ventilatory response (HVR) varies among individuals and has a genetic component. High altitude adaptations include changes in resting ventilation, HVR, oxygen saturation, and hemoglobin concentration. Rapid ascent to altitude causes immediate increases in minute ventilation and respiratory alkalosis. Shifts in the oxygen-dissociation curve occur, initially increasing oxygen affinity, followed by a decrease as 2,3-DPG levels rise. Blunted HVR (due to genetic factors or sedatives) leads to exaggerated hypoxemic pulmonary vasoconstriction (HPV). HPV increases perfusion to affected alveoli, raising capillary pressures and permeability, leading to non-uniform pulmonary edema. This edema further impedes oxygen transport and exacerbates pulmonary hypertension. Clinical features HAPE typically manifests 2 to 5 days after arriving at high altitude. Initial symptoms include non-productive cough, decreased exercise tolerance, chest pain, and exertional dyspnea. Progression can lead to dyspnea at rest, productive cough with pink frothy sputum, rales, and cyanosis. Patients may exhibit tachypnea and tachycardia. SpO2 levels are often significantly lower than expected for altitude, with values typically ranging from 40% to 70%. Low hypoxic ventilatory response (Option A) : A low HVR is a significant risk factor for developing altitude-related illnesses, including HAPE. It impairs the body's ability to respond to low oxygen levels, making it more likely for the patient to experience severe hypoxia and associated symptoms. Use of sleep medications during ascent (Option B) : Sleep medications can depress the respiratory drive, leading to a reduced HVR. This can worsen hypoxia at high altitudes, increasing the risk of HAPE and contributing to the patient's clinical features. Recent heavy physical exertion prior to ascent (Option C) : Engaging in heavy physical exertion can lead to fatigue and increased susceptibility to altitude sickness,",

Administer 100% oxygen via face mask to treat or prevent hypoxemia. Establish intravenous access above the diaphragm to prevent obstruction by the gravid uterus. Identify and treat any precipitating factors contributing to cardiac arrest. A pregnant patient with in-hospital cardiac arrest should not be transported for cesarean delivery. Management should occur at the site of the arrest. (Option A ruled out) Immediately perform chest compressions (CPR) at a rate of at least 100 per minute, with a depth of at least 2 inches (5 cm), allowing full recoil. Limit interruptions to 10 seconds, except for advanced airway placement or defibrillation. Continuously perform manual left uterine displacement (LUD) if the uterus is palpated at or above the umbilicus. Use the same defibrillation protocol as in nonpregnant patients, applying biphasic shocks of 120 to 200 J, escalating if necessary. (Option D ruled out) For refractory ventricular fibrillation or tachycardia, administer amiodarone 300 mg rapid infusion, with 150 mg doses as needed. Consider administering 1 mg epinephrine IV/IO every 3 to 5 minutes during cardiac arrest; it is preferred over vasopressin. (Option C ruled out) If maternal resuscitation fails, consider a cesarean section if the gestational age is greater than 23 weeks, ideally performed within 4 minutes after maternal arrest to maximize fetal survival. Fetal Survival : The earlier the fetus is delivered following maternal arrest, the better the chances of survival, with the best outcomes if delivered within 5 minutes of CPR initiation. Supine Hypotensive syndrome Supine hypotensive syndrome occurs in late pregnancy (usually after 20 weeks) due to the gravid uterus compressing the inferior vena cava and aorta when a pregnant woman lies on her back, leading to maternal hypotension. Treatment involves repositioning the patient to alleviate compression, either by turning her onto her left side or manually displacing the uterus if spine immobilization is needed.",

PRBC carries oxygen and helps neutralize the acidosis component. This is important because acidosis impairs the ability of blood to clot, which could worsen coagulopathy. Also, ABC Score ≥ 2 predicts massive transfusion needs (75% accuracy). Platelets should not be given first as their function would be impaired by acidosis. The ratio of PRBC:FFP: PRP should be maintained at 1:1:1, but the sequence must start with PRBC.

Resume ASV at a slower rate after symptoms subside Pyrogenic Reaction 1-2 hours after treatment - Fever - Rigors - Hypotension - Symptomatic treatment - Antipyretics - IV fluids if needed Late (Serum Sickness) Reaction 5-24 days (mean 7 days) after ASV - Fever - Itching - Urticaria - Arthralgia - Lymphadenopathy - Proteinuria - Antihistamines - Corticosteroids (e.g., prednisolone) for 5-7 days Discontinue ASV infusion permanently (Option A) is incorrect because ASV is crucial for treating severe envenomation. After managing the reaction, ASV should be restarted. Continuing ASV infusion and administering corticosteroids (Option B) is incorrect because continuing the infusion during an anaphylactic reaction can worsen the patient's condition. The infusion should be stopped first. Administer heparin (Option D) is incorrect and potentially dangerous. Heparin is contraindicated in snake bite-induced coagulopathy and would not address the anaphylactic reaction.

The clinical criteria for sepsis include: Suspected infection An acute increase of ≥ 2 SOFA (Sequential Organ Failure Assessment) points In this case: The patient has a suspected lung infection (fever and chest X-ray infiltrate). There is evidence of organ dysfunction: Respiratory: PaO2/FiO2 ratio < 400 (requires oxygen) Renal: Creatinine increase > 0.3 mg/dL from baseline This meets the Sepsis-3 criteria for sepsis. SOFA (Sequential Organ Failure Assessment) Score: The SOFA score is a more comprehensive tool used to assess organ dysfunction in potentially septic patients. It evaluates six organ systems: Respiratory (PaO2/FiO2 ratio) Cardiovascular (Mean arterial pressure and vasopressor requirements) Hepatic (Bilirubin level) Coagulation (Platelet count) Renal (Creatinine level or urine output) Neurological (Glasgow Coma Scale) Each system is scored from 0 to 4, with higher scores indicating more severe dysfunction. A total SOFA score ranges from 0 to 24. In the context of sepsis diagnosis, an acute increase in the SOFA score of 2 or more points is considered indicative of organ dysfunction associated with sepsis. SIRS (Option A): While the patient meets SIRS criteria, this term is no longer used in the Sepsis-3 definition. A patient is considered to have SIRS if they meet two or more of the following criteria: Body temperature >38°C (100.4°F) or <36°C (96.8°F) Heart rate >90 beats per minute Respiratory rate >20 breaths per minute or PaCO2 <32 mmHg White blood cell count >12,000/mm³, <4,000/mm³, or >10% immature bands While SIRS criteria are no longer part of the formal sepsis definition, they remain useful for quickly identifying patients who may need further evaluation for infection or organ dysfunction. Severe sepsis (Option C): This term was used in older definitions but is no longer part of Sepsis-3. Septic shock (Option D): The patient does not meet the criteria for septic shock, which requires vasopressor therapy to maintain MAP ≥ 65 mmHg and serum lactate >2.0 mmol/L despite adequate fluid resuscitation.

Acute pulmonary edema due to volume overload from blood transfusion. Onset Usually within 6 hours of transfusion. Can occur during or up to 12 hours post-transfusion. Pathophysiology Immune-mediated injury to pulmonary capillaries leads to fluid leakage into alveoli. Volume overload causes increased hydrostatic pressure in the pulmonary circulation. Symptoms Sudden onset of dyspnea, hypoxemia, fever, hypotension. Dyspnea, orthopnea, rapid weight gain, hypertension .

Cardiomegaly, pulmonary edema, pleural effusions (cardiogenic pulmonary edema). Blood Pressure Hypotensive or normal. Hypertensive. Laboratory Findings Neutrophilia, leukocytosis, and anti-HLA antibodies in donor blood (in some cases). Elevated BNP (brain natriuretic peptide), no specific markers for TACO. Treatment Supportive care (oxygen, mechanical ventilation if necessary), no diuretics. Diuretics (e.g., furosemide), oxygen, stopping or slowing the transfusion. Prevention Use of leukocyte-reduced or HLA-matched blood products. Slow transfusion rate, avoid excess volume, and monitor for fluid overload. Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) (Option C) can occur in trauma patients and has similar radiographic findings. However, ARDS typically develops over 24-48 hours, not as acutely as described in this case. The direct relationship to transfusion makes TRALI more likely in this case. Cardiogenic pulmonary edema (Option D) would present with elevated blood pressure and increased BNP levels due to heart failure. The normal blood pressure and BNP levels in this case make cardiogenic pulmonary edema unlikely. Additionally, the acute onset in relation to transfusion points more toward a transfusion-related complication rather than a primary cardiac issue.
