The infant’s mother mentions that the jaundice has been present since birth and that the infant has not shown any signs of hemolysis. What is the most likely underlying cause of this infant's condition related to bilirubin metabolism?",

      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: B) Defective conjugation of bilirubin due to UGT1A1 mutation Explanation: The infant’s jaundice is primarily due to elevated unconjugated bilirubin levels , indicating a problem with bilirubin processing. The mutation in the UGT1A1 gene leads to Crigler Najjar syndrome which disrupts the conjugation process, leading to an accumulation of unconjugated bilirubin in the liver. Bilirubin Metabolism: Bilirubin is the final product of heme degradation, with 70–90% originating from senescent red blood cells. It is transported to the liver bound to albumin due to its water insolubility. Hepatocellular Uptake Bilirubin uptake by hepatocytes occurs through carrier-mediated transport, although the specific transporter is not yet identified. Intracellular Binding Inside hepatocytes, bilirubin binds to glutathione-S-transferases (previously called ligandins) to remain in solution. Conjugation Bilirubin is conjugated with glucuronic acid by UDP-glucuronosyltransferase ( UGT1A1 ), forming mono- and di-glucuronides. Conjugation disrupts hydrogen bonds, increasing bilirubin’s solubility and allowing excretion into bile. The UGT1 gene family, specifically UGT1A1 , is responsible for conjugation; mutations in these genes can affect isoform functions differently depending on the exon affected. Biliary Excretion Conjugated bilirubin (mono- and di-glucuronides) is excreted into bile via the ATP-dependent transporter MRP2 (ABCC2); mutations in MRP2 lead to Dubin-Johnson syndrome . Part of the conjugated bilirubin may enter portal circulation and undergo reuptake into hepatocytes by OATP1B1 and OATP1B3, which is defective in Rotor syndrome (SLCO1B1 and SLCO1B3 gene mutations) Impaired uptake of bilirubin by hepatocytes (Option A) : This would lead to increased unconjugated bilirubin levels, not elevated conjugated bilirubin, as seen in this infant. Thus, uptake is not the primary issue. Reduced biliary excretion of bilirubin due to MRP2 mutation (Option C) : While an MRP2 mutation could lead to elevated conjugated bilirubin, it’s less likely here since the infant shows no signs of cholestasis, making defective conjugation a more probable cause. Mutations in the MRP2 (ABCC2) gene disrupt bilirubin glucuronide transport across the canalicular membrane, causing bilirubin accumulation in hepatocytes. Increased production of bilirubin due to hemolysis (Option D) : Increased hemolysis would raise",

      "explanation": "Correct Answer: D) Gilbert Syndrome Explanation: The patient’s mildly elevated unconjugated bilirubin levels, normal liver function tests , and intermittent jaundice during stress and fasting incidentally diagnosed in adolescence are all characteristic of Gilbert Syndrome . Gilbert Syndrome About Gilbert Syndrome (GS) is a common, benign condition with mild unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia and normal liver function tests , affecting up to 8% of people, more common in males. Pathophysiology Caused by reduced UGT1A1 enzyme activity (10–35% of normal), often due to a TA insertion variant in the UGT1A1 promoter (A[TA]7TAA). Inheritance is typically autosomal recessive with the promoter variant; some cases show dominant inheritance with other mutations. Clinical Features Serum bilirubin <51 µ mol/L (<3 mg/dL), fluctuating with stress, fasting, alcohol, or illness; jaundice may occur during elevations. Most patients are asymptomatic, though jaundice can occur during episodes of elevated bilirubin levels. Often diagnosed incidentally in adolescence or adulthood. Investigations Serum bilirubin levels are intermittently high, with Normal liver function tests and hepatic histology . UGT1A1 gene testing may reveal the A[TA]7TAA promoter variant. Management Usually no treatment is needed. Lifestyle adjustments, such as avoiding alcohol and maintaining regular calorie intake, may help manage bilirubin levels. Phenobarbital can normalize bilirubin levels if required. Caution with drugs metabolized by UGT1A1 (e.g., irinotecan, HIV protease inhibitors) due to risk of toxicity. Crigler-Najjar Syndrome Type I (Option A) is characterized by severe unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia (typically >20 mg/dL) due to the complete absence of UGT1A1 activity. Patients often exhibit significant jaundice from infancy and are at risk for kernicterus. The bilirubin levels in the scenario are too low for this diagnosis. Crigler-Najjar Syndrome Type II (Option B) occurs due to reduced UGT1A1 activity (10-20% of normal) leading to unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia; it still presents with higher bilirubin levels than in Gilbert Syndrome. Dubin-Johnson Syndrome (Option C) is characterized by conjugated hyperbilirubinemia due to defective biliary excretion of conjugated bilirubin due to multidrug resistance protein (MRP 2) defect leading to increased direct bilirubin in the serum. Liver function tests show abnormal results, which are not consistent with the normal findings in this case. Reference: Harrison’s Principles of Internal Medicine, 21st Edition, Page 2559, 2560",

      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: A) Crigler-Najjar Syndrome Type I Explanation: The infant’s extremely high unconjugated bilirubin level ( 450 µ mol/L) is characteristic of Crigler-Najjar Syndrome Type I , which presents with severe, lifelong unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia, typically starting in the neonatal period. Kernicterus risk is high due to the bilirubin level, which aligns with CN-I features. Crigler-Najjar Type II would present with lower bilirubin levels and a reduced risk of kernicterus. Hyperbilirubinemia syndromes Crigler-Najjar Syndrome Type I (CN-I) Gene: UGT1A1 Pathology: Complete absence of bilirubin UDP-glucuronosyltransferase (UDPGT) activity; No bilirubin conjugation occurs, leading to severe unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia. Clinical features Severe jaundice from birth extreme hyperbilirubinemia (>342 µ mol/L or >20 mg/dL) high risk of kernicterus , with neurological damage. Often fatal without intervention. Investigations Increased unconjugated bilirubin + conjugated bilirubin absent No signs of excessive hemolysis No bilirubin UDPGT activity– no response to phenobarbital No bilirubin glucuronides in bile (bile is pale or colorless). Management Requires lifelong phototherapy; Liver transplantation is often definitive in preventing neurological damage. Crigler-Najjar Syndrome Type II (CN-II) Gene: UGT1A1 Pathology: Marked reduction ( ≤ 10% of normal) in bilirubin UDPGT activity partial conjugation of bilirubin occurs Clinical features Moderate jaundice with serum bilirubin levels of 103–428 µ mol/L (6–25 mg/dL) kernicterus is possible under stress conditions (illness or surgery) Usually presents in infancy or childhood Investigations Increased unconjugated bilirubin + conjugated bilirubin present Reduced bilirubin UDPGT activity; Unconjugated bilirubin levels decrease significantly in response to phenobarbital; Bile contains bilirubin monoglucuronide Management Phenobarbital therapy to induce residual UDPGT activity Dubin-Johnson Syndrome (Option C) Gene: ABCC2 gene Pathology: Mutations in the MRP2 (ABCC2) gene disrupt bilirubin glucuronide transport across the canalicular membrane, causing bilirubin accumulation in hepatocytes. Clinical features Asymptomatic or with mild symptoms Mild to moderate jaundice that can darken with age Hepatocytes accumulate dark pigment but liver function is normal.

      "explanation": "Correct Answer: A) Dubin-Johnson Syndrome Explanation: The patient’s symptoms of intermittent jaundice, elevated conjugated bilirubin levels, and normal liver function tests are characteristic of Dubin-Johnson Syndrome. The exacerbation of symptoms during hormonal changes (menstrual cycle and oral contraceptives) aligns with known triggers for this benign condition. Dubin-Johnson Syndrome (DJS) About Rare, benign disorder with low-grade, predominantly conjugated hyperbilirubinemia. Bilirubin levels may fluctuate widely, especially with intercurrent illness, oral contraceptives, or pregnancy. Pathophysiology Caused by defective MRP2 (ABCC2) transporter , affecting biliary excretion of conjugated bilirubin and certain anionic compounds. Autosomal recessive inheritance. Clinical Features Jaundice with elevated conjugated bilirubin levels. Typically asymptomatic; occasional vague symptoms or hepatosplenomegaly may occur. Cardinal feature - Liver appears black due to black, coarse granular pigment accumulation in lysosomes of centrilobular hepatocytes. Investigations Elevated conjugated bilirubin with bilirubinuria. Normal liver function tests, except for bilirubin. Urinary coproporphyrin isomer I >80% (diagnostic feature). Bromsulphthalein (BSP) test: Shows reflux of conjugated BSP into plasma at 90 minutes. Management Generally, no treatment is required due to its benign nature. Awareness of triggers (e.g., pregnancy, oral contraceptives) that may exacerbate jaundice. Rotor Syndrome (Option B) is similar to Dubin-Johnson but usually presents with less severe conjugated hyperbilirubinemia and does not have the characteristic black liver. The lab findings and clinical features in this case are more consistent with Dubin-Johnson. Budd-Chiari Syndrome (Option C) involves hepatic venous outflow obstruction, leading to abdominal pain, ascites, and liver dysfunction. The patient's normal liver function tests and lack of significant clinical symptoms do not support this diagnosis. Crigler-Najjar Syndrome Type II (Option D) is associated with moderate unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia, not conjugated. The patient’s elevated conjugated bilirubin levels and the presence of triggers (hormonal changes) do not fit with Crigler-Najjar Type II.

      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: C) Rotor Syndrome Explanation: The patient’s elevated conjugated bilirubin levels, presence of bilirubinuria, and normal appearance of the liver with visualization of the gallbladder are characteristics of Rotor Syndrome. This condition is similar to Dubin-Johnson but lacks the liver pigmentation associated with Dubin-Johnson Syndrome. Rotor Syndrome (RS) About Rare, benign autosomal recessive disorder with clinical similarity to Dubin-Johnson Syndrome (DJS). Major phenotypic difference: liver appears normal with no increased pigmentation. Pathophysiology Caused by deficiency of OATP1B1 (SLCO1B1) and OATP1B3 (SLCO1B3) transporters. Results in reduced reuptake of conjugated bilirubin from portal circulation, leading to bilirubinuria. Clinical Features Jaundice due to elevated conjugated bilirubin levels; bilirubinuria is present. Gallbladder visualised on oral cholecystography (unlike DJS). Investigations Elevated conjugated bilirubin with bilirubinuria. Increased total urinary coproporphyrin with coproporphyrin I <70% (compared to ≥ 80% in DJS). Bromsulphthalein (BSP) test : Delayed clearance, but no reflux of conjugated BSP into circulation. Management No specific treatment is required due to its benign nature. Awareness of differential diagnosis from DJS for appropriate management. Crigler-Najjar Syndrome Type I (Option A) involves severe unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia due to absent UGT1A1 activity, which would not present with elevated conjugated bilirubin levels as seen in this patient. Gilbert Syndrome (Option B) is characterized by mild unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia and is typically asymptomatic. The presence of elevated conjugated bilirubin and bilirubinuria in this case makes Gilbert Syndrome an unlikely diagnosis. Dubin-Johnson Syndrome (Option D) presents with elevated conjugated bilirubin and bilirubinuria but is associated with a characteristic black liver due to pigment accumulation, which is not noted in this patient. The gallbladder is also visualized, unlike in Dubin-Johnson. Reference: Harrison’s Principles of Internal Medicine, 21st Edition, Page 2561",

      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: B) Budd-Chiari Syndrome Explanation: The patient’s symptoms of abdominal pain, ascites, jaundice, and hepatomegaly, combined with the ultrasound findings of hepatic vein occlusion, are characteristic of Budd-Chiari Syndrome, which involves hepatic venous outflow obstruction. Budd Chiari Syndrome (BCS) About Uncommon disorder with hepatic venous outflow tract obstruction. Primary BCS: Caused by venous processes like thrombosis or phlebitis. Secondary BCS: Caused by external compression or invasion (e.g., malignancy). Pathogenesis Single hepatic vein occlusion is usually silent; occlusion of 2 veins causes venous congestion and liver capsule stretching (painful). Sinusoidal dilation and interstitial fluid filtration lead to liver congestion and ascites. Thrombosis and obstruction cause portal hypertension and decreased liver blood flow, leading to hypoxic injury in centrilobular hepatocytes. Acute cases: Can cause liver failure; chronic cases may lead to ascites, hepatomegaly, and eventual cirrhosis. Caudate lobe hypertrophy occurs due to direct shunting into the IVC. Clinical Features Disease Duration: Acute (weeks), subacute (months), chronic (with cirrhosis), and fulminant (rapid liver failure, no venous collaterals). Common Triad: Abdominal pain, ascites, hepatomegaly. Acute/Subacute: Ascites, abdominal pain, jaundice, hepatomegaly, renal failure, hepatic encephalopathy. Chronic: Progressive ascites without jaundice; possible renal impairment. Rare Presentation: Tender hepatomegaly, fulminant liver failure, jaundice, renal failure. Physical Exam: Jaundice, ascites, hepatomegaly, splenomegaly, pedal oedema, and stasis ulcerations. Dubin-Johnson Syndrome (Option A) is characterised by elevated conjugated bilirubin due to defective biliary excretion and typically presents with mild jaundice. The severe abdominal symptoms and hepatic vein occlusion in this case do not fit this diagnosis. Gilbert Syndrome (Option C) is associated with mild unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia and is usually asymptomatic. The acute symptoms of abdominal pain, ascites, and jaundice indicate a much more serious condition, not consistent with Gilbert Syndrome. Rotor Syndrome (Option D) presents with elevated conjugated bilirubin and bilirubinuria but does not involve significant abdominal pain or ascites. The findings of hepatic vein occlusion and severe liver symptoms are not characteristic of Rotor Syndrome. Reference: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK558941/",

Initial management generally includes anticoagulation and evaluation of underlying causes before considering transplantation. Starting diuretics alone and monitoring symptoms (Option C) may help manage ascites but do not address the underlying thrombosis or prevent further clotting. Anticoagulation is necessary to reduce clot progression in hepatic vein thrombosis. Performing surgical shunting as primary therapy (Option D) is not a first-line treatment; it’s typically considered if anticoagulation and other interventions like TIPS fail to control symptoms or improve liver function.

      "explanation": "occurs, Rotor syndrome - early excretion with no delayed retention. Correct Answer: B) Dubin johnson syndrome - delayed excretion with prolonged retention of BSP occurs; Rotor syndrome - early excretion with no delayed retention Explanation: BSP test shows prolonged retention of the dye in Dubin-Johnson syndrome due to impaired excretion, while in Rotor syndrome , the dye is excreted promptly without delayed retention. This difference in BSP handling helps in distinguishing between the two syndromes. Bromsulphthalein (BSP) test The BSP test involves injecting bromsulphthalein dye into the bloodstream and measuring its retention and excretion by the liver. Normally , the liver should process and excrete BSP efficiently, with minimal retention i n the blood after a set period. Delayed or prolonged retention of BSP suggests an issue with the liver's excretory function, which can vary between DJS and Rotor syndrome. DJS - Prolonged retention of the dye indicating impaired excretion similar to the buildup of bilirubin Rotor syndrome - no prolonged retention of dye; the liver is still able to process and excrete the dye without significant delay.
