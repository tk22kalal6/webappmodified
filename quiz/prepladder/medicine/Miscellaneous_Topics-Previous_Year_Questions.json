      "question": "What vitamin deficiency is responsible for the following symptoms in a patient: tingling sensation in the hands and feet, generalized weakness, easy fatigability, pallor, and ataxia?",
      "options": {
        "A": "Vitamin B1",
        "B": "Vitamin B12",
        "C": "Vitamin B2",
        "D": "Vitamin B3"
      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "weakness, easy fatiguability, pallor, and ataxia, are suggestive of a neurological condition known as peripheral neuropathy. Several vitamin deficiencies can cause peripheral neuropathy, but the most common ones are deficiencies in vitamin B12. Vitamin B12, also known as cobalamin, is important to produce red blood cells and the proper functioning of the nervous system. Deficiency in vitamin B12 can cause pernicious anemia, which can manifest as peripheral neuropathy, as well as weakness, fatigue, and pallor. Therefore, vitamin B12 deficiency is a likely cause of the symptoms described in the question. Incorrect choices: Option a: Vitamin B1, also known as thiamine, is essential for the proper functioning of the nervous system, muscles, and cardiovascular system. A deficiency in vitamin B1 can cause a condition called beriberi, which can manifest as peripheral neuropathy, muscle wasting, and heart failure. However, the symptoms described in the question, such as ataxia and pallor, are not typical of beriberi. Option c: Vitamin B2, also known as riboflavin, is important to produce energy and the metabolism of fats, carbohydrates, and proteins. Deficiency in vitamin B2 can cause a condition called ariboflavinosis, which can manifest as glossitis, cheilosis, and skin rash, but not peripheral neuropathy. Option d: Vitamin B3, also known as niacin, is important for the proper functioning of the nervous system and the metabolism of fats, carbohydrates, and proteins. Deficiency in vitamin B3 can cause a condition called pellagra, which can manifest as the \"3 Ds\" - dermatitis, diarrhea, and dementia, but not peripheral neuropathy.",

      "question": "Cat scratch disease is caused by?",
      "options": {
        "A": "Bartonella henselae",
        "B": "b.Bartonella quintana",
        "C": "c.Bartonella bacilliformis",
        "D": "d.Borrelia burgdorferi"
      },
      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "disease is most commonly transmitted to humans through the bite or scratch of an infected cat, although it can also be transmitted through fleas that have fed on an infected cat. Bartonella henselae is a gram-negative, rod-shaped bacterium that can survive and replicate within cells, including human cells. Once the bacteria enter the body through a cat scratch or bite, they typically spread to nearby lymph nodes, where they can cause inflammation and swelling. Incorrect Choices: b. Bartonella quintana, another species of the Bartonella genus, is the causative agent of trench fever, a common bacterial infection among soldiers during World War I. c. Bartonella bacilliformis is the causative agent of Carrion's disease, a bacterial infection transmitted by sandflies and found in parts of South America. d. Borrelia burgdorferi, conversely, is the causative agent of Lyme disease, a bacterial infection transmitted to humans through the bite of infected ticks.",

      "question": "A man brings his father who became unconscious while working in a field in the host sun at 42 degrees Celsius in May. One examination, there were no physical signs of dehydration. His serum electrolyte values were normal. The physician found that the body temperature was 106 F. Which of the following symptoms is least likely to be seen in this patient?",
      "options": {
        "A": "Nausea",
        "B": "Hypotension",
        "C": "Sweating",
        "D": "Headache"
      },
      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "stroke, which is a severe form of heat illness that occurs when the body's temperature regulation system fails. In heat stroke, the body's core temperature can rise to 104 F (40 C) or higher, which can lead to serious complications, including organ damage and death. Sweating is the body's natural mechanism to cool down in hot environments. However, in cases of severe heat stroke, the body's thermoregulatory system becomes impaired, and sweating may stop. This happens when the body's sweat glands fail to produce sweat or when the sweat evaporates too quickly due to the dry and hot environment. Incorrect choices: Option a: Nausea is a common symptom of heat stroke, as the body tries to cope with the high temperature by increasing blood flow to the skin and reducing blood flow to the digestive system. This can lead to nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea. Option b: Hypotension (low blood pressure) is also a common symptom of heat stroke, as the body tries to conserve fluid by constricting blood vessels. This can cause blood pressure to drop, which can lead to dizziness, fainting, and shock. Option d: Headache is another common symptom of heat stroke, as the brain tries to cope with the high temperature by increasing blood flow to the head. This can lead to headaches, confusion, and seizures.",

      "question": "What is the most likely diagnosis for a tall male with a lack of pubic and axillary hair, underdeveloped genitalia, elevated levels of LH and FSH, and a karyotype of XXY?",
      "options": {
        "A": "a.Vanishing testis syndrome",
        "B": "b.Klinefelter’s syndrome",
        "C": "c.Noonan syndrome",
        "D": "d.Adrenal hyperplasia"
      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "high LH and FSH levels, and an XXY karyotype is Klinefelter's syndrome. Klinefelter's syndrome is a genetic disorder that occurs in males who have an extra X chromosome, resulting in a karyotype of 47, XXY instead of the normal 46, XY. This condition can lead to a variety of physical, cognitive, and behavioral symptoms, including tall stature, decreased body hair, underdeveloped genitalia, infertility, and cognitive and language delays. The elevated levels of luteinizing hormone (LH) and follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) are a result of testicular failure and impaired testosterone production. Incorrect choices: Option a: Vanishing testis syndrome is a condition in which one or both testes fail to descend into the scrotum and subsequently atrophy, resulting in reduced testosterone production. This condition can cause infertility and hormonal imbalances, but it typically presents with normal male external genitalia and normal LH and FSH levels. Option c: Noonan syndrome is a genetic disorder that affects multiple body systems and can cause a variety of symptoms, including short stature, heart defects, developmental delays, and abnormal facial features. While Noonan syndrome can affect sex hormone levels, it is not typically associated with the absence of pubic and axillary hair or infantile genitalia. Option d: Adrenal hyperplasia is a group of genetic disorders that affect the adrenal glands and can cause hormonal imbalances. Depending on the specific type of adrenal hyperplasia, symptoms can include abnormal genital development, early puberty, and elevated levels of sex hormones. However, the absence of pubic and axillary hair and infantile genitalia are not typical features of adrenal hyperplasia. Reference: .",
