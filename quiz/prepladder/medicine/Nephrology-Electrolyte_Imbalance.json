      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Correct answer: B) IV potassium chloride 10 mEq/hour with cardiac monitoring Explanation : For severe hypokalemia (serum potassium of 2.3 mEq/L), IV potassium replacement is necessary, but it should be given cautiously due to the risk of arrhythmias. The standard rate is 10 mEq/hour with cardiac monitoring. Hypokalemia Serum potassium level of 3 to 3.4 mmol/L is classified as mild. A serum potassium level of 2.5 to 3 mmol/L is classified as moderate. Serum potassium levels less than 2.5 mmol/L are classified as severe. Hypokalemia Treatment: The therapeutic goals for hypokalemia are to prevent or treat life-threatening complications, correct the potassium deficit, and address the underlying cause. Potassium replacement is indicated in most hypokalemia cases, especially when renal or gastrointestinal losses are significant. Mild-to-moderate hypokalemia: Typically, it is treated with oral potassium supplements. Providing 60 to 80 mmol/day over days to weeks is usually sufficient. IV administration is given if oral therapy is not tolerated. Severe Hypokalemia or hypokalemia with clinical symptoms: Replacement therapy must be provided rapidly. The standard rate is 10 mEq/hour IV administration with cardiac monitoring Pain and phlebitis usually occur with peripheral IV infusions when infusion rates exceed 10 mmol/h. A risk of rebound hyperkalemia exists when rates exceed 20 mmol/h. Serum potassium levels should be checked every 2 to 4 hours. In cases of renal or gastrointestinal losses, potassium replacement is aimed at promptly elevating serum potassium levels to a safe range, followed by gradual replenishment of the remaining deficit over days to weeks.

      "explanation": "Correct answer: D) IV Furosemide Explanation : The following symptoms and signs in the patient (Elevated JVP and bounding pulse) and ECG findings showing tall T waves and a wide QRS complex suggest Hyperkalemia in hypervolemic patients with preserved kidney function. CHF leads to volume retention, and since the patient is on ACE inhibitors, hyperkalemia has occurred Hyperkalemia: Usually greater than 5.0 mEq/L to 5.5 mEq/L. While mild hyperkalemia is usually asymptomatic, high potassium levels may cause life-threatening cardiac arrhythmias, muscle weakness, or paralysis. Symptoms usually develop at higher levels, 6.5 mEq/L to 7 mEq/L. Diagnosis : The first test that should be ordered in a patient with suspected hyperkalemia is an ECG since the most lethal complication of hyperkalemia is cardiac conduction abnormalities, which can lead to cardiac arrest and death. Elevated potassium causes ECG changes in a dose-dependent manner : K = 5.5 to 6.5 mEq/L ECG will show tall, peaked t-waves K = 6.5 to 7.5 mEq/L ECG will show loss of p-waves K = 7 to 8 ECG mEq/L will show a widening of the QRS complex K = 8 to 10 mEq/L will produce cardiac arrhythmias, sine wave pattern, and asystole ECG features of hyperkalemia : Small or absent P wave Prolonged PR interval Augmented R wave Wide QRS Peaked T waves Serum blood urea nitrogen and creatinine are used to assess renal function, and urinalysis is used to screen for renal disease. Urine potassium, sodium, and osmolality may also help evaluate the cause. Uric acid and phosphorus should be ordered in patients with suspected tumour lysis syndrome. Treatment: hyperkalemia \" data-author=\"\" data-hash=\"11322\" data-license=\"\" data-source=\"\" data-tags=\"April2025\" src=\"https://image.prepladder.com/notes/tgZsO9X8qXUiHHpDNbeb1745643209.png\" /> Exogenous sources of potassium should be immediately discontinued. Calcium therapy will stabilize the cardiac response to hyperkalemia and is a first-line therapy in hyperkalemia-related arrhythmias and ECG changes. Calcium should never be given in bicarbonate-containing fluids, as it can cause the precipitation of calcium carbonate. Insulin will drive the potassium back into the cell and lowering serum potassium levels. The common regimen is ten units of regular insulin given with 50 ml of a 50% dextrose solution (D50). Beta-2 adrenergics such as albuterol will also shift potassium intracellularly and reduce serum potassium levels. Intravenous epinephrine , however, should not be used to manage hyperkalemia due to an increased risk of causing angina . Loop or thiazide diuretics may help enhance potassium excretion. In hypervolemic patients with preserved kidney function (patients with congestive cardiac failure), 40 mg of intravenous furosemide is administered every 12 hours. In euvolemic or hypovolemic patients with preserved kidney function, an isotonic saline infusion is given. Haemodialysis should be preferred in patients with end-stage renal disease. IV Albuterol (Option A): Helps shift potassium intracellularly, but it is usually considered an adjunctive treatment rather than a primary approach in hypervolemic patients. IV",

      "correct_answer": "D",
      "explanation": "Correct answer: D) Hyperaldosteronism Explanation : Hyperaldosteronism is associated with hypokalemia, not hyperkalemia. Aldosterone increases potassium excretion by the kidneys, leading to low potassium levels. Hyperkalemia: Usually greater than 5.0 mEq/L to 5.5 mEq/L. While mild hyperkalemia is usually asymptomatic, high potassium levels may cause life-threatening cardiac arrhythmias, muscle weakness, or paralysis. Symptoms usually develop at higher levels, 6.5 mEq/L to 7 mEq/L. Causes: Pseudohyperkalemia is most commonly due to hemolysis of the sample, causing intracellular potassium to be measured in the serum. Increased Potassium Intake Increased potassium intake from food is a very uncommon cause of hyperkalemia in adult patients with normal renal function but can be an important cause in those with kidney disease.

This leads to peaked T waves on ECG, arrhythmias , and muscle weakness . Hyperphosphatemia : The release of phosphate from the nucleus and cytoplasm, which can lead to hypocalcemia (because calcium binds to phosphate). Hyperuricemia : Due to the breakdown of purines (from Nucleic acids), leading to uric acid buildup . This can precipitate in the kidneys and lead to acute kidney injury . Hypocalcemia : Occurs as a result of phosphate binding to calcium, leading to a drop in serum calcium levels, which can cause muscle cramps , tetany , or seizures. Management : TLS is managed by hydration , allopurinol (to prevent uric acid buildup), and, if necessary, rasburicase (to break down uric acid), as well as treatment for electrolyte abnormalities. Hypoaldosteronism (Option A) : Causes hyperkalemia and hyponatremia but does not explain the elevated uric acid or the acute systemic symptoms seen in this patient. Gout (Option C): Elevated uric acid is common, but gout presents with joint pain and inflammation, not acute electrolyte imbalances and ECG changes. Drug reactions (Option D) : While chemotherapy drugs can cause electrolyte disturbances, the specific pattern of findings (elevated uric acid and peaked T waves) points to tumour lysis syndrome, not a nonspecific drug reaction.

      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: C) Hypokalemia Explanation: The patient's symptoms, including muscle weakness, fatigue, and the ECG findings (flattened T waves and U waves) , are indicative of hypokalemia . Hypokalemia Serum potassium level of 3 to 3.4 mmol/L is classified as mild. A serum potassium level of 2.5 to 3 mmol/L is classified as moderate. Serum potassium levels less than 2.5 mmol/L are classified as severe. Clinical features: Symptoms indicative of potassium deficiency include muscle weakness, cramps, spasms, fatigue, palpitations, constipation, and abdominal discomfort. It can also present with torsades de pointes and ventricular tachycardia. Clinical symptoms of hypokalemia are present when the serum potassium level is less than 3 mmol/L. Significant muscle weakness occurs at serum potassium levels below 2.5 mmol/L but can occur at higher levels if the onset is acute. Death in hypokalemia: Hypokalemia manifests as an ascending paralysis, with the lower extremities developing profound weakness before the trunk and upper extremities. The condition may affect the respiratory muscles, which can lead to respiratory failure and death. Diagnosis : Serum electrolytes can help assess hypokalemia severity and detect other electrolyte deficiencies. Urinary potassium excretion assessment: Distinguish renal losses from other causes. Excretion of more than 30 mEq of potassium per day indicates inappropriate renal potassium loss. Spot urine potassium concentration or urine potassium-to-creatinine ratio: Urine potassium concentration greater than 15 or a ratio greater than 13 mEq/mmol of creatinine. ECG findings: Decreased T wave amplitude (Earliest ECG change) Depressed ST segment Appearance of a U-wave Prolonged QT interval T-wave flattening initially manifests, followed by T-wave inversion and eventually the absence of T",

        "D": "Kounis syndrome"
      },
      "correct_answer": "D",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: D) Kounis syndrome Explanation : Kounis syndrome : A condition characterised by the occurrence of acute coronary syndrome associated with an allergic reaction/anaphylaxis. Mast cell activation and release of cytokines lead to coronary artery spasm or plaque rupture. It is unrelated to potassium levels and, therefore, is not a cause of hypokalemia. Normal Serum potassium levels = 3.5-5 meq/L Hypokalemia : Defined as a serum potassium level of less than 3.5 mEq/L. Potassium is an essential electrolyte critical in various physiological functions, including muscle contraction, nerve transmission, and maintaining normal cardiac rhythm. Hypokalemia can lead to symptoms such as muscle weakness, cramping, fatigue, and arrhythmias. Causes of Hypokalemia: Hypokalemia can result from various mechanisms, including decreased intake, increased loss, or potassium shifts into cells. Here are the main categories of causes: Increased Renal Loss Diuretic Use: Loop diuretics (furosemide) and thiazide diuretics can lead to significant potassium loss. Hyperaldosteronism : Conditions like Conn's syndrome increase aldosterone secretion, increasing potassium excretion. Renal Tubular Disorders Gitelman syndrome (Option B) : A genetic disorder causing loss of electrolytes, including potassium. Liddle syndrome (Option A) : A genetic condition that increases sodium reabsorption and potassium excretion. Cushing’s Syndrome : Excess cortisol can lead to hypokalemia through its mineralocorticoid effects. Gastrointestinal Losses Vomiting Diarrhea Laxative Abuse Decreased potassium Intake Inadequate Dietary Intake Intravenous Fluids: Administration of IV fluids without adequate potassium supplementation can lead to hypokalemia, particularly in hospitalised patients. Cellular Shift Alkalosis : In metabolic alkalosis, potassium shifts into cells, contributing to hypokalemia. Insulin Administration: Insulin promotes potassium uptake into cells, which can lead to hypokalemia, especially when given in high doses. Miscellaneous Causes Fanconi Syndrome (Option C) : A condition that affects the PCT and can lead to the loss of potassium and other electrolytes. Magnesium Deficiency Renal hypokalemia includes chloride-responsive metabolic alkalosis Congenital adrenal hyperplasia from 11- β or 17- α -hydroxylase deficiency Renin-secreting tumors Ectopic corticotropin stimulation ectopic adrenocorticotropic hormone syndrome Cushing disease or Cushing syndrome Hereditary glucocorticoid-responsive aldosteronism Hypertensive emergency and malignant hypertension Renovascular hypertension renal artery stenosis",

      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: B) Metabolic acidosis Explanation: Serum potassium: 6.5 mEq/L (normal range: 3.5-5.0 mEq/L) Serum bicarbonate: 15 mEq/L (normal range: 22-24 mEq/L) The patient has hyperkalemia (high potassium level), which can occur in conditions of metabolic acidosis, particularly in kidney disease, where potassium excretion is impaired. The patient’s bicarbonate level of 15 mEq/L indicates metabolic acidosis, which is below the normal range. The combination of hyperkalemia and low bicarbonate strongly suggests a diagnosis of metabolic acidosis. Serum potassium Normal serum potassium levels typically range from 3.5 to 5.0 mEq/L. Potassium is crucial for various physiological functions, including: Maintaining normal cellular function. Regulating nerve conduction and muscle contraction, including the heart. Maintaining acid-base balance. Relationship of Serum potassium with insulin and pH Insulin ↓ Serum Potassium: Insulin promotes potassium uptake into cells, lowering serum potassium levels. PH is inversely proportional to serum potassium. Acidosis ↑ Serum Potassium: In metabolic acidosis, potassium shifts out of cells to compensate for elevated plasma H+ ions in acidosis, which shift inside the cells, resulting in elevated serum potassium levels. Alkalosis ↓ Serum Potassium: In metabolic alkalosis, potassium shifts into cells to compensate for H+ ions, which shift outside the cells into plasma in alkalosis to maintain electrolyte balance, potentially leading to lower serum potassium levels. Hyperkalemia (Elevated Potassium Levels): Defined as serum potassium greater than 5.0 mEq/L. Common causes include: Chronic kidney disease: Impaired excretion. Acute kidney injury: Sudden loss of kidney function. Medications : ACE inhibitors, potassium-sparing diuretics. Acidosis : Metabolic acidosis can cause potassium to shift from cells to the extracellular space. Symptoms may include muscle weakness, fatigue, palpitations, and, in severe cases, cardiac arrest. Treatment : Calcium gluconate or calcium chloride (for cardiac protection). Insulin and glucose (to shift potassium back into cells). Beta-agonists Hypokalemia (Low Potassium Levels): Defined as serum potassium less than 3.5 mEq/L. Common causes include: Diuretics : Particularly loop and thiazide diuretics. Gastrointestinal losses: Vomiting, diarrhea, or excessive laxative use. Hyperaldosteronism : Increased potassium secretion. Symptoms may include muscle weakness, cramping, fatigue, and arrhythmias.

      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: B) 0.5 mEq per hour Explanation: To safely correct hypernatremia, the sodium reduction should not exceed 0.5 mEq/L per hour to minimise the risk of cerebral oedema. The primary goal in treating hypernatremia is to lower serum sodium gradually to avoid rapid shifts in water into brain cells, which can cause cerebral oedema. The recommended rate of correction for chronic hypernatremia is no more than 0.5 mEq/L per hour or 12 mEq/L per day. Proper management of hypernatremia involves identifying the underlying condition and correcting the hypertonicity. The goal of therapy is to correct both the serum sodium and the intravascular volume. In patients with severe dehydration or shock, the initial step is fluid resuscitation with isotonic fluids before free water correction. Hypernatremia is corrected by calculating the free water deficit using the formula: Total Body Water[0.6 in men and 0.5 in women x body weight(kg)] x [(plasma sodium/140) -1] 4ml x bodyweight x (desired change in serum sodium meq/L) Correcting too quickly ( e.g.>1 mEq/L per hour ) can result in serious complications like brain swelling. Close serial monitoring of serum sodium every 2 to 4 hours is essential during the acute phase of correction. The estimated free water deficit should be corrected over 48 to 72 hours.

      "correct_answer": "D",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: D) Hypoaldosteronism Explanation : Hypoaldosteronism leads to hyponatremia , as aldosterone is responsible for sodium retention in the kidneys. A deficiency would result in sodium loss. Hypernatremia is defined as a serum sodium concentration of greater than 145 meq/L. Causes of Hypernatremia can be broadly classified into two categories: Water deficit and excess solute. Water Deficit (Dehydration) Diabetes Insipidus (Central or Nephrogenic) (Option A) : Inadequate secretion or response to antidiuretic hormone (ADH) leads to excessive free water loss in the urine. Gastrointestinal Losses: Severe diarrhoea, especially in conditions like osmotic diarrhoea can cause loss of water leading to hypernatremia. Burns : Large surface area burns can lead to fluid loss and concentration of sodium. Impaired Thirst Mechanism (Option C) : This can occur in elderly patients with neurological conditions (dementia, Alzheimer’s disease). Excessive lactulose use (Option B) : Lactulose can cause dehydration and hypernatremia through significant fluid losses, especially in patients with diarrhoea. Excess Sodium Gain Hypertonic Sodium Solutions: Administration of hypertonic saline (e.g., 3% saline) or sodium bicarbonate can cause hypernatremia. Primary Hyperaldosteronism (Conn’s Syndrome): Excess aldosterone causes sodium retention and potassium excretion, potentially leading to hypernatremia in rare cases. Iatrogenic (Hospital-Acquired) Causes Inappropriate Use of Diuretics: Certain diuretics can cause free water loss without significant sodium loss. Overcorrection of Hyponatremia: Too rapid correction of hyponatremia with hypertonic saline can result in hypernatremia. Common Conditions Associated with Hypernatremia: Diabetes Insipidus (central or nephrogenic) Severe dehydration (diarrhoea, vomiting, burns, sweating) Excessive salt intake or administration of hypertonic saline Osmotic diuresis (e.g., in hyperglycemia) Reference: Hypernatremia",

Pedal oedema is seen in hypervolemic states and not in euvolemic/ hypovolemic conditions. Electrolyte normal values: Na+ 135-145 mEq/L K+ 3.5-5 mEq/L Cl- 98-106 mEq/L Hypervolemic hyponatremia: Primary defect (Hypotonic state) TBW ↑↑ ; TBS ↑ (But sodium concentration ↓ ) (TBW- Total body water, TBS- Total body sodium) Pathogenesis Hyperaldosteronism secondary to massive ascites - leading to increased activity of ENaC channels → Water retention ↑↑ (in comparison to salt retention).

SIADH (Syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion): Increased ADH leads to water retention with near-normal sodium levels. Water overload leads to the release of ANP ( Atrial natriuretic peptide) from atria. ANP causes natriuresis which leads to euvolemic hyponatremia. No edema occurs.

      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: A) Hypovolemic hyponatremia Explanation: Gastrointestinal fluid loss by diarrhoea or vomiting is an example of hypovolemic hyponatremia. Hypovolemic hyponatremia is a condition where the body loses more sodium than water, decreasing total body water and sodium. This causes a decrease in blood volume and serum osmolality, which triggers the release of vasopressin (antidiuretic hormone, or ADH) to maintain blood volume. The resulting water retention dilutes the plasma, leading to hyponatremia. Causes of Hypovolemic Hyponatremia Gastrointestinal fluid loss ( diarrhoea or vomiting) The third spacing of fluids (pancreatitis, hypoalbuminemia, small bowel obstruction) Diuretics Osmotic diuresis (glucose, mannitol) Salt-wasting nephropathies Cerebral salt-wasting syndrome (urinary salt wasting, possibly caused by increased brain natriuretic peptide) Mineralocorticoid deficiency Reference: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK470386/#:~:text=Hypotonic%20hyponatremia%20represents% 20an%20excess,capacity%20to%20excrete%20free%20water .",
