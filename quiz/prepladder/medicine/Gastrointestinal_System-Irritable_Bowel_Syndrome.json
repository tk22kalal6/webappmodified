      "question": "A 45-year-old male presents with recurrent episodes of abdominal pain associated with altered bowel habits for the past six months. He reports experiencing abdominal discomfort relieved by defecation. The physician provided the diagnosis of IBS based on Rome IV criteria. Which of the following statements is true regarding Rome IV diagnostic criteria for IBS?",
      "options": {
        "A": "1 out of the 3 features should be present for the diagnostic of IBS",
        "B": "Recurrent abdominal pain present at least 1 day per week in the last 3 months",
        "C": "Symptoms should be associated with pain or discomfort that is relieved by eating.",
        "D": "Symptoms should be associated with rectal bleeding."
      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Correct answer: B) Recurrent abdominal pain present at least 1 day per week in the last 3 months discomfort and altered bowel habits in the absence of detectable structural abnormalities. Rome IV diagnostic criteria for irritable bowel syndrome:- Clinical features: Abdominal pain : Mostly episodic and crampy. Exacerbated by eating and emotional stress. Improves with defecation with change in frequency or form of stool. Altered bowel habits : Weeks or months of constipation with incomplete evacuation interrupted by brief periods of diarrhea. Other features : Abdominal distension or Belching. Dyspepsia or Heartburns. Nausea and Vomiting. The following are not considered significant features of IBS : Nocturnal diarrhea Steatorrhea Blood in stools (Option D ruled out) Increased stool volume Fever or high ESR Weight loss, malabsorption. 1st symptom after 50 years of age.

      "question": "A patient presents with a 3-month history of crampy abdominal pain associated with diarrhea. Which of the features supports a diagnosis of irritable bowel syndrome?",
      "options": {
        "A": "Persistent diarrhea after a 48-hour fast",
        "B": "Nocturnal diarrhea",
        "C": "Onset of Symptoms during a period of stress",
        "D": "Steatorrhea"

      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "often exacerbated by eating or emotional stress and improved by the passage of flatus or stools. Features in favor of IBS: Features not in favor of IBS Abdominal pain that worsens/improves with defaecation Associated with stress or emotional symptoms Small volume of stools Nocturnal diarrhea Steatorrhea Blood in stools (Option D ruled out). Increased stool volume Fever or high ESR Weight loss, malabsorption. 1st symptom after 50 years of age. IBD vs IBS: Endoscopy will help differentiate IBD from IBS. Direct camera visualisation: Characteristic lesions of IBD, such as aphthous ulceration and skip lesions, can be seen. Biomarker: Fetal calprotectin levels help to differentiate IBD and IBS. Inflammatory Bowel Disease Irritable Bowel Syndrome Presence of blood in stool - Anemia (Option A ruled out) Example- Protein-induced enteropathy Weight loss due to hypoproteinemia, hypoalbuminemia Symptoms are very bothersome and will always interfere with sleep. Sleep deprivation - rare Pain increases with anxiety Female - increase in symptoms during menstrual cycle Weight loss and blood in the stools are not present Age group < 45 years usually.

      "question": "In a 30-year-old female with recurrent abdominal pain and altered bowel habits for the past year, symptoms exacerbated during periods of stress and a history of childhood trauma and ongoing anxiety. Considering these factors, which underlying mechanism is likely to contribute significantly to the pathophysiology of her symptoms?",
      "options": {
        "A": "Dietary intolerance to lactose.",
        "B": "Impaired Gastric Acid Secretion",
        "C": "Gut Dysbiosis",
        "D": "Chronic use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs)"

      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "permeability and increase antigen presentation, resulting in mast cell activation. Products of mast cell degranulation may alter neuronal and smooth-muscle function causing IBS symptoms. The cytokines and chemokines generated from mucosal inflammation may cause symptoms such as fibromyalgia, chronic fatigue, mood changes, and gastrointestinal dysfunction. Pathophysiology of IBS:- Gut dysbiosis : Dietary intolerance to lactose (Option A) Symptoms of lactose intolerance, such as bloating and diarrhea, may overlap with those of IBS but are not directly linked to its pathophysiology. Impaired Gastric Acid Secretion (Option B) This statement suggests that the patient's symptoms are related to impaired gastric acid secretion. However, impaired gastric acid secretion is not a well-established mechanism underlying the pathophysiology of Irritable Bowel Syndrome (IBS). Chronic use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) (Option D) While chronic NSAID use can contribute to gastrointestinal symptoms such as abdominal pain and dyspepsia, it is not typically a primary cause of Irritable Bowel Syndrome (IBS)",

      "question": "A 28-year-old male presents with symptoms of bloating, abdominal pain, and irregular bowel habits consistent with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). After confirming the diagnosis, which of the following dietary interventions is most likely to provide symptomatic relief for this patient?",
      "options": {
        "A": "High-carbohydrate diet",
        "B": "Low FODMAP diet",
        "C": "High-protein diet",
        "D": "High-fiber diet"
      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "carbohydrates known as FODMAPs (fermentable oligosaccharides, disaccharides, monosaccharides, and polyols). Foodstuffs containing lactose, fructose, and sorbitol are some examples of FODMAPS. A diet rich in FODMAP (fermentable oligosaccharides, disaccharides, monosaccharides, and polyols ) often triggers symptoms in IBS patients (Option A ruled out). FODMAPs are poorly absorbed by the small intestine and fermented by bacteria in the colon to produce gas and osmotically active carbohydrates. At the same time, on entering the colon, FODMAPs may serve as nutrients for the colonic bacteria and promote the growth of gram-negative commensal bacteria, which may induce epithelial damage and subclinical mucosa inflammation. Pathogenesis of fodmap-related symptoms : High-protein diet (Option C) While increasing protein intake may be beneficial for certain aspects of health, there is no evidence to suggest that a high-protein diet specifically alleviates symptoms of IBS. High-fiber diet (Option D) While increasing fiber intake may benefit some individuals with IBS, particularly those with constipation-predominant symptoms, it is not universally recommended as the initial approach. High-fiber foods can exacerbate symptoms such as bloating and gas in certain individuals with IBS.",

      "question": "A 26-year-old female with IBS presents for a second opinion, with complaints of recurrent abdominal pain and constipation. She has been adherent to a low-FODMAP diet for the last two months, on the advice of her first physician. What is the next best step?",
      "options": {
        "A": "Dicyclomine & Loperamide",
        "B": "Lubiprostone & Dicyclomine",
        "C": "Continue diet",
        "D": "Mesalamine"
      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "secondary to IBS despite dietary modification. The treatment of IBS is predominantly symptom-guided. Thus, an antispasmodic (dicyclomine) and a laxative (e.g. lubiprostone) would be appropriate in this patient. Lubiprostone: Lubiprostone is a chloride channel opener. It encourages water influx into the stool, softening it. Treatment for constipation-predominant IBS includes lactulose, Lubiprostone, PEG (osmotic laxatives), tegaserod (5HT4 agonist), and linaclotide (Guanylyl cyclase agonist). Treatment for diarrhoea-predominant IBS includes Peripheral-acting opioid agents (Eluxadoline) and loperamide. Additional treatment options for IBS include SSRIs, TCAs, antibiotics (Rifaximin, neomycin), and probiotics. Drugs used in irritable bowel syndrome: For abdominal pain For diarrhea For constipation Antispasmodiacs - Dicyclomine Tricyclic Antidepressants - Amitriptyline SSRI - Citalopram Opiate - Loperamide 5HT3 antagonist - Alosteron Bile acid sequestrants - Cholestyramine resin Laxative - Psyllium, Isaphagula husk Cl channel activator - Lubipristone 5HT4 agonist - Tegaserod SSRI - Paroxetine Loperamide is an opioid agonist that may be used for diarrhoea. Loperamide would worsen this patient’s symptoms. (Option A) Given that this patient has persistent symptoms resistant to a low-FODMAP diet, continuing the same treatment would be inappropriate. (Option C) Mesalamine is the first-line treatment for inflammatory bowel disease and has no role in IBS.
