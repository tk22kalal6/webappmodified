      "question": "A 40-year-old woman reports experiencing recurrent headaches that last between 6 and 48 hours. She often feels fatigued and has mood changes before the headaches begin. According to the International Headache Society's criteria, which features are essential for diagnosing her condition as migraine?",
      "options": {
        "A": "Bilateral pricking pain with nausea",
        "B": "Unilateral pain with photophobia without nausea",
        "C": "Unilateral throbbing pain with phonophobia",
        "D": "Bilateral pain with photophobia and nausea"
      },
      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: C) Unilateral throbbing pain with phonophobia Explanation: Unilateral throbbing pain with phonophobia meets the diagnostic criteria for migraines. It specifies unilateral pain, describes the pain as throbbing (a key characteristic), and includes phonophobia (sensitivity to sound), fulfilling the requirement for at least three features from the specified list. Migraine: Common migraine (80%, without aura) Classical migraine (20%,with aura) Theories of migraine: Migraine Pain and Brain Activity : Migraine pain is thought to arise from waves of activity in excitable brain cells, which trigger the release of chemicals like serotonin, leading to changes in blood vessel size and pain sensitivity. Role of Serotonin and Estrogen : Serotonin plays a key role in migraine pain by narrowing blood vessels, while fluctuating estrogen levels (especially in women) are linked to migraines, with both serotonin and estrogen contributing to pain sensitivity. Hormonal Influence in Women : Women are more prone to migraines due to natural fluctuations in estrogen levels, with migraines often occurring during hormonal changes, such as those experienced during the menstrual cycle or menopause. Clinical Features of Migraine Premonitory (Prodromal) Phase Neck discomfort Cognitive impairment (brain “fog”) Mood changes Fatigue Yawning/sleepiness Increased urination and thirst Food cravings Aura Neurologic disturbances (e.g., visual disturbances like scintillating scotoma) Due to Cerebral vasoconstriction. Therefore prevention is by Vasodilators. Headache Phase Pain Nausea/vomiting Sensory sensitivities: Photophobia (sensitivity to light) Phonophobia (sensitivity to sound) Osmophobia (sensitivity to smells) Allodynia (pain from non-painful stimuli) Vertigo Due to cerebral vasodilation. So treatment is Vasoconstrictors Postdrome Tiredness Weariness Impaired concentration Diagnostic Classification: Simplified Diagnostic Criteria for Migraine by International Headache Society Repeated attacks of headache lasting 4–72h in patients with a normal physical examination, no other reasonable cause for the headache, and: At least 2 of the following features: Plus at least 1 of the following features: Unilateral pain Throbbing pain Aggravation by movement Moderate or severe intensity Nausea/vomiting Photophobia and phonophobia Bilateral pricking pain with nausea (Option A): This describes bilateral pain, which does not meet migraine criteria that require unilateral pain. The term \"pricking\" suggests a tension-type headache rather than a migraine. Unilateral pain with photophobia without nausea (Option B): This option includes unilateral pain and photophobia, but lacks nausea. Without two qualifying features, it cannot be fully classified as",

The pain is described as a dull, bilateral ache , often associated with neck tension, stress, and fatigue , which are characteristic features of TTH. Her report of difficulty concentrating and disrupted sleep further supports the chronic nature of the headaches, distinguishing them from episodic TTH. Amitriptyline is the first-line treatment for chronic tension-type headaches (TTH) . It is a tricyclic antidepressant (TCA) used for prevention , and it should be started at a low dose (10–25 mg daily) and increased gradually. Treatment of Tension-Type Headache (TTH) 1. Episodic TTH First-line Drugs: Ibuprofen : 400 mg Acetaminophen : 1000 mg Combination : Ibuprofen and acetaminophen together may provide better results. (Option B ruled out) Other NSAIDs (effective for acute TTH): Naproxen sodium : 375–550 mg Ketoprofen : 25–50 mg Diclofenac : 50–100 mg Not Recommended : Aspirin (ASA) : 500 mg dose found to be no more effective than placebo. (Option C ruled out) Precaution : Avoid frequent analgesic use to prevent medication-overuse headaches. 2. Chronic TTH Pharmacological Management : Amitriptyline (TCA): Primary drug for chronic TTH prevention Start at 10–25 mg daily ; increase by 10–25 mg weekly as needed. Continue for at least 6 months , then consider tapering. Adverse effects: dry mouth, drowsiness, urinary retention, cardiac arrhythmias, glaucoma. SSRIs and SNRIs : Generally less effective than TCAs. Botulinum toxin type A : Not first-line; may be considered in refractory cases. (Option C ruled out) Non-Pharmacological Management : Physical therapy : Includes relaxation, exercise, and posture improvement.

      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "by the superior cerebellar artery. Correct Answer: B) Most commonly caused by vascular compression of the trigeminal nerve, often by the superior cerebellar artery. Explanation: This patient has trigeminal neuralgia (TN) , characterized by sharp, electric shock-like pain affecting the maxillary (V2) and mandibular (V3) branches of the trigeminal nerve, triggered by light touch. The condition is most commonly caused by vascular compression , often by the superior cerebellar artery , leading to demyelination of the nerve. Aspect Trigeminal Neuralgia Glossopharyngeal Neuralgia About Also known as \"tic douloureux,\" is a chronic neurological condition marked by recurrent, brief episodes of electric shock-like facial pain. Usually affects one side of the face and commonly involves the maxillary (V2) and mandibular (V3) branches of the trigeminal nerve. Pain episodes are triggered by stimuli like touch, chewing, or exposure to cold air. A rare pain syndrome affecting the sensory distribution of the glossopharyngeal nerve (CN IX). Characterized by brief, sharp, unilateral pain in areas like the jaw angle, ear, tonsillar fossa, and base of the tongue. Pain episodes are triggered by coughing, talking, or swallowing. (Option A ruled out) Etiopathogenesis Caused mainly by vascular compression of the trigeminal nerve root, ofte,pn by the superior cerebellar artery. Other causes include space-occupying lesions (e.g., tumors), multiple sclerosis, or other vascular abnormalities. Compression leads to demyelination of the nerve, resulting in abnormal transmission of impulses, causing pain. Idiopathic (unknown cause) or secondary to specific conditions: Vascular compression, especially near the nerve root. Demyelinating diseases (e.g., multiple sclerosis), infections, and autoimmune conditions (e.g., Sjögren's disease). Intracranial tumors (medullary tumors, CP angle tumors). Anatomical anomalies (Eagle syndrome). Rarely linked with oropharyngeal cancers (e.g., tongue carcinoma). Clinical Features Pain is typically unilateral, sharp, and brief, often described as \"electric shock-like.\" Triggers include light touch to specific facial areas (\"trigger zones\") and routine activities like brushing teeth or shaving. Pain episodes can occur multiple times per day, sometimes with a refractory period following each episode. V1 involvement (rare) may present with autonomic symptoms like tearing and rhinorrhea. (Option D ruled out) Intense, episodic, sharp pain lasting seconds to minutes. Pain is unilateral, often affecting the ear, tongue base, and tonsillar fossa. Relapsing-remitting pain pattern, may lead to weight loss due to difficulty eating. Occasionally, pain is associated with bradycardia, asystole, or syncope. Diagnosis Diagnosis is often clinical, supported by MRI or MRA to rule out secondary causes or vascular compression. High-resolution MRI (e.g., FIESTA sequencing) helps visualize",

      "question": "A 56-year-old male presents to the emergency department following a severe head injury. On examination, he shows signs of increasing intracranial pressure, including altered consciousness and anisocoria (unequal pupil size). His CT scan reveals significant brain swelling and herniation. The medical team suspects a specific type of brain herniation. Which of the following types of brain herniation is most likely responsible for the patient’s altered pupillary response?",

        "D": "Cerebellar Tonsillar Herniation"
      },
      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: C) Transtentorial Uncal Herniation Explanation: Transtentorial uncal herniation involves compression of the third cranial nerve (oculomotor nerve), which can cause pupil changes (constriction followed by dilation). This is due to the herniation of the medial temporal lobe (uncus) through the tentorial notch, which places pressure on the nerve. This herniation can also lead to other complications, such as hydrocephalus and ipsilateral motor deficits (via the Kernohan's notch phenomenon). Brain Herniation: Brain herniation is a life-threatening event where parts of the brain shift through specific openings (foramina) within the skull due to increased intracranial pressure (ICP). This can occur when the brain's compensatory mechanisms, like the displacement of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and changes in blood volume (Monro-Kellie doctrine), are overwhelmed. Causes : Tumour, meningitis, trauma and bleed. Brain herniation is a neurological emergency that requires immediate intervention to prevent irreversible damage. Types of Brain Herniation Subfalcine Herniation The cingulate gyrus moves beneath the anterior falx. Leads to infarction in the anterior cerebral artery territory. Causes lower limb weakness due to infarction of motor areas and compression of vessels. (Option A ruled out) Transalar/ Transsphenoidal Herniation Descending: Compression of the middle cerebral artery by the sphenoid ridge causes infarction. Ascending: Compression of the internal carotid artery causes infarction in the anterior and middle cerebral arteries. (Option B ruled out) Transtentorial Uncal Herniation Compression of the 3rd nerve causes pupil changes (constriction followed by dilation). Can lead to hydrocephalus, temporal/occipital lobe infarction, and ipsilateral motor deficits ( Kernohan’s notch ). Central Herniation (Descending and Ascending) Descending: Brainstem compression causes Duret hemorrhages and Cushing triad (hypertension, bradycardia, irregular respirations). Ascending: Compression of the posterior cerebral or superior cerebellar arteries. Cerebellar Tonsillar Herniation Cerebellar tonsils move through the foramen magnum. Compresses the brainstem and upper cervical cord, leading to life-threatening conditions. Leads to ischemia of brainstem, tonsils, and lower cerebellum. (Option D ruled out) Transcalvarial Herniation Occurs due to calvarial defects (e.g., after hemicraniectomy). Brain tissue herniates through the skull defect, potentially causing hemorrhagic infarction. Reference: Brain Herniation - StatPearls - NCBI Bookshelf",

      "question": "A 45-year-old male presents with a history of recurrent headaches. After a thorough evaluation, he is diagnosed with a headache that has a stinging character and characterized by the following features: Duration: 5-240 seconds Attacks: 3-200 attacks per day. Which of the following treatments is most appropriate for this condition?",
      "options": {
        "A": "High-flow oxygen",
        "B": "Sumatriptan",
        "C": "IV Lidocaine",
        "D": "Verapamil"
      },
      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: C) IV Lidocaine Explanation: The patient in question presents with a type of headache characterized by a duration of 5-240 seconds and a frequency of 3-200 attacks per day. These features align with SUNCT (Short-lasting Unilateral Neuralgiform headache attacks with Conjunctival injection and Tearing) . Duration: SUNCT headaches are very brief, lasting from just a few seconds to a few minutes, often ranging between 5 to 240 seconds. Frequency: The frequency of attacks is notably high, with patients experiencing anywhere from 3 to 200 attacks in a single day. This is a hallmark of SUNCT, distinguishing it from other headache types like Cluster Headaches, which typically involve fewer attacks per day (1-8). Pain Quality: The pain associated with SUNCT is unilateral and can be described as sharp or stabbing, similar to the pain experienced in Cluster Headaches but significantly shorter in duration. Intravenous Lidocaine has been shown to provide significant relief from the symptoms of SUNCT. The mechanism involves its action as a sodium channel blocker, which helps alleviate headache symptoms. High-flow oxygen (Option A) This treatment is effective for Cluster Headaches , as inhaling high-flow oxygen can significantly decrease the severity of the pain. However, it is not indicated for SUNCT, where the duration and frequency of attacks are much different. Sumatriptan (Option B) Triptans, such as Sumatriptan, are typically used for the acute treatment of Cluster Headaches and are effective for relieving pain when used at the onset of an attack. However, they are not the first-line treatment for SUNCT and are generally less effective for this condition. Verapamil (Option C) While preventive medications such as verapamil are commonly used for Cluster Headaches to reduce the frequency of attacks, they do not specifically address acute SUNCT episodes and are not the preferred initial treatment for this condition.

      },
      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: A) Start high-dose corticosteroids Explanation: Starting high-dose corticosteroids is the most appropriate next step in the management of Giant Cell Arteritis. Prompt initiation of high-dose corticosteroids is crucial to prevent complications, particularly vision loss, which can occur if the condition progresses. Giant Cell Arteritis: Giant Cell Arteritis (GCA) , also known as temporal arteritis, is a systemic vasculitis primarily affecting l arge and medium-sized arteries , particularly the temporal arteries. More prevalent in women than men (2-3 times more common). Clinical features: Presenting symptoms include new-onset headaches, often severe and localized to the temporal region, scalp tenderness, jaw claudication, characterized by pain or fatigue in the jaw muscles during chewing. Additionally, visual disturbances such as diplopia, blurred vision, or sudden vision loss may occur due to ischemic optic neuropathy. Systemic symptoms like fatigue, fever, night sweats, and unintentional weight loss further characterize the condition. Investigations: Laboratory tests typically show elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) and C-reactive protein (CRP). Temporal artery biopsy is the definitive diagnostic test, showing necrotizing vasculitis and giant cells in the arterial wall. Treatment: The management of GCA primarily involves the use of corticosteroids. High-dose corticosteroids, such as prednisone, are the mainstay of treatment Perform temporal artery biopsy (Option B): While a temporal artery biopsy is the gold standard for diagnosis and is often performed, it should ideally be done after the initiation of corticosteroids if the diagnosis of GCA is highly suspected, especially considering the risk of blindness. Initiate aspirin therapy (Option C): Aspirin may be considered for vascular protection, but it is not the primary treatment for GCA. The immediate focus should be on controlling inflammation with corticosteroids. Refer for imaging studies of the carotid arteries ( Option D) While imaging can be helpful in assessing the extent of vascular involvement, it is not the immediate step when GCA is suspected. The clinical presentation and laboratory findings are sufficient to start treatment. Reference: Harrison’s Principles of Internal Medicine, 21st Edition, Page no: 3357",

      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: C) To evaluate headache-related disability and its impact on daily activities. work, school, and social activities, providing insights into their overall disability. MIDAS Test: The MIDAS (Migraine Disability Assessment) is a self-administered questionnaire. It assesses headache-related disability over the past three months. The questionnaire consists of five questions about productivity loss and limitations in work, school, household, and social activities. It includes a global question on migraine severity, rated from 0 (no pain) to 10 (very severe pain). Additional questions gather information on headache frequency and intensity. The MIDAS is a reliable and valid tool with good test-retest reliability and correlates with clinical needs for medical care. MIDAS Questionnaire Instructions Please answer the following questions about all the headaches you have had over the last 3 months. Select your answer in the box next to each question. Select zero if you did not have the activity in the last 3 months. Please take the complete form to your healthcare professional. Questions On how many days in the last 3 months did you miss work or school because of your headaches? How many days in the last 3 months was your productivity at work or school reduced by half or more because of your headaches (do not include days you counted in question 1 where you missed work or school)? How many days in the last 3 months have you not done household work because of your headaches? How many days in the last 3 months was your productivity in household work reduced by half or more because of your headaches (do not include days you counted in question 3 where you did not do household work)? On how many days in the last 3 months did you miss family, social, or leisure activities because of your headaches? What your Physician will need to know about your headaches: How many days in the last 3 months did you have a headache? (If a headache lasted more than one day, count each day.) On a scale of 0–10, on average how painful were these headaches? (Where 0 = no pain at all, and 10 = pain as bad as it can be.) Grading Total MIDAS scores categorize migraine-related disability into four grades: Grade I: Little or no disability (0–5) Grade II: Mild disability (6–10) Grade III: Moderate disability (11–20) Grade IV: Severe disability ( ≥ 21) To determine the specific medication needed for treatment (Option A): The MIDAS questionnaire does not focus on identifying specific medications; it is designed to assess the impact of migraines on a person's life, not to prescribe treatment. To assess the frequency of headache attacks (Option B): While the MIDAS includes questions related to headache frequency, its primary aim is to evaluate the disability and limitations caused by the headaches rather than simply counting their occurrence. To classify the type of headache (Option D): The MIDAS does not classify the type of headache. Its focus is on assessing the impact of headaches on daily functioning rather than diagnosing or categorizing the headaches themselves.

(Option A ruled out) NSAIDs: Naproxen, ibuprofen, tolfenamic acid, diclofenac. Triptans (5-HT1B/1D Agonists): Sumatriptan, rizatriptan, naratriptan, eletriptan, frovatriptan, zolmitriptan. (Option C ruled out) Gepants (CGRP Receptor Antagonists): Rimegepant, ubrogepant. (Option D ruled out) Ditans (5-HT1F Agonists): Lasmiditan. Dopamine Receptor Antagonists: Metoclopramide, prochlorperazine. Other Options: Combination medications (e.g., acetaminophen, dichloralphenazone, isometheptene), opioids (limited use). Non-Pharmacologic Management: Identify and avoid triggers. Regulated lifestyle: Healthy diet, regular exercise, consistent sleep, stress management (e.g., yoga, meditation). Neuromodulation techniques: sTMS, nVNS. Key Recommendations: Use medications early in an attack. If symptoms persist after 60 minutes, consider increasing the initial dose or switching drug classes. Individualize treatment based on attack severity and patient response. Indications for Preventive Treatment: Consider for patients with four or more migraine attacks per month or those unresponsive to abortive treatments. Pharmacologic Options: Beta Blockers: Propranolol, metoprolol. Antidepressants: Amitriptyline, nortriptyline, venlafaxine. Anticonvulsants: Topiramate, valproate. CGRP Antagonists: Eptinezumab, erenumab, fremanezumab, galcanezumab. Other Medications: Flunarizine , candesartan, melatonin. Considerations: Preventive treatments often take 2–12 weeks to show effect. Side effects vary; some medications require careful monitoring (e.g., weight gain with certain antidepressants). Neuromodulation (sTMS) is also FDA-approved for prevention. Patient Management: Start with low doses and gradually increase. Monitor effectiveness and side effects. After stabilization, taper off medication after approximately six months to assess ongoing need. Severity Classification Migraine severity can be assessed using tools like the Migraine Disability Assessment Scale ( MIDAS ), which categorizes migraines as follows: Grade 1: Little or no disability Grade 2: Mild disability Grade 3: Moderate",

      "explanation": "Correct Answer: B) Medication overuse headache Explanation: Medication overuse headache is classified as a secondary headache because it results from the frequent use of headache medication, unlike tension-type headaches, migraines, and primary stabbing headaches, which are all considered primary headaches. Primary Headaches Secondary Headaches Migraine (with or without aura) (Option C ruled out) Tension-type headache- Most common (Option A ruled out) Trigeminal autonomic cephalalgia (cluster) (Option D ruled out) Primary stabbing headache Primary coughing headache Primary exertional headache Sex-related headache Thunderclap headache New daily persistent headache syndrome Medication overuse headache (chronic daily headache) Intracranial bleeding (subdural haematoma, subarachnoid or intracerebral haemorrhage) Raised intracranial pressure (brain tumour, idiopathic intracranial hypertension) Infection (meningitis, encephalitis, brain abscess) Inflammatory disease (temporal arteritis, other vasculitis, arthritis) Referred pain from other structures (orbit, temporomandibular joint, neck) Treatment of Medication Overuse Headache (MOH) 1. Patient Education and Prevention Educate on appropriate medication use and risks of MOH. Emphasize the importance of limiting acute headache medications to ≤ 2 days per week. 2. Medication Discontinuation Strategies Stop overused medication abruptly (preferred for most patients) and start/optimize preventive therapy, titrated based on individual factors. Gradual tapering: Useful for opioids, barbiturates, or benzodiazepines (2-4 weeks for high doses; transdermal clonidine or phenobarbital may help with withdrawal). 3. Preventive Medications Beta-blockers, calcium channel blockers, TCAs, and anticonvulsants. Topiramate and onabotulinumtoxinA (useful, especially in chronic migraine with MOH). 4. Bridge Therapy NSAIDs: Naproxen, indomethacin, ketorolac Adjuncts: Tizanidine with NSAIDs, antiemetics (prochlorperazine, metoclopramide), and dihydroergotamine (DHE) for severe cases. Raskin protocol: IV DHE + metoclopramide every 8 hours. 5. Alternative Approaches Withdrawal symptoms management: NSAIDs, hydration, antiemetics, magnesium, and lidocaine infusions. Discontinuation first approach: Avoid starting preventive therapy for 2 months post-medication discontinuation (less tolerated).

        "D": "X-ray skull and acetaminophen"
      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: B) USG skull and phenobarbitone Explanation: The newborn has signs suggestive of intracranial hemorrhage , likely due to birth trauma (forceps delivery). The high-pitched cry, bulging anterior fontanelle, and irritability are concerning for increased intracranial pressure (ICP) , potentially due to subdural or epidural hemorrhage . CT scan of the head is the initial diagnostic imaging of choice for detecting intracranial hemorrhage in neonates, especially in emergency situations. Intraventricular Hemorrhage in Neonates Key Risk Factors - Prematurity ( ≤ 32 weeks) - Low birth weight (<1500g) - No antenatal steroids - Vaginal delivery Clinical Features - Bulging fontanelle - Apnea/lethargy - Seizures - Often asymptomatic Diagnosis - Head USG (primary tool) - MRI for complications Management - Minimal handling - Maintain stable BP - Monitor for hydrocephalus - Phenobarbital for convulsion prevention CT Head and Surgical Evacuation (Option A): It often requires sedation in neonates. It's not the preferred initial step in a hemodynamically stable newborn, especially when safer and quicker bedside tools are available. MRI Brain and Mannitol (Option C): MRI is highly sensitive but not practical as an initial investigation in acute neonatal settings due to longer scan time and the need for sedation. Mannitol is not routinely used in neonates unless there’s confirmed raised intracranial pressure, and even then, with caution. X-ray Skull and Acetaminophen (Option D): Skull X-ray may detect fractures but won’t provide information about brain parenchyma or bleeding. Acetaminophen has no role in managing suspected intracranial hemorrhage or seizures. Reference: 1. pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC2901530/ 2. www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK538310/",

      },
      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: C) Emergency burr hole followed by craniotomy Explanation: This case presents a classic epidural hematoma requiring emergency intervention because of: Deteriorating consciousness Focal neurological signs (pupillary dilation, hemiparesis) Significant midline shift (>5mm) Classic temporal location suggesting middle meningeal artery involvement Other indications of Evacuation: Clot >30cc vol Thickness>1.5 mm GCS<9 Extradural hematomas are neurosurgical emergencies when symptomatic. Emergency- Burr hole surgery Definitive- Craniotomy with hematoma evacuation. Clinical Features of Epidural Hematoma (EDH) Initial Loss of Consciousness: Often after trauma, followed by a brief lucid interval (temporary recovery of consciousness), which occurs in 14% to 21% of EDH cases. However, not all patients experience a lucid interval. Neurological Deterioration: The lucid interval may end with rapid neurological deterioration as the hematoma expands and raises intracranial pressure (ICP). Variable Consciousness Levels: Some patients may not experience a lucid interval, with presentations ranging from initial unconsciousness to coma. Posterior Fossa EDH: Rare but severe, accounting for about 5% of EDH cases. Delayed loss of consciousness can occur as the hematoma grows, and patients may become apneic and die if untreated. Signs of Elevated ICP: As the hematoma enlarges, ipsilateral pupil dilation (due to uncal herniation and oculomotor nerve compression) can occur, along with elevated blood pressure, bradycardia, and irregular breathing (known as the Cushing reflex). Observe and monitor neurological status (Option A): Incorrect because observation alone is dangerous in a deteriorating patient with significant mass effect. Start mannitol and hyperventilate (Option B): Incorrect because while these measures may temporarily help, they are adjuncts to definitive surgical management. Conservative management with anticonvulsants (Option D): Incorrect because conservative management is inappropriate for a large, symptomatic extradural hematoma.

      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: C) IV Nicardipine Explanation: IV Nicardipine is used first line in case of hemorrhagic stroke to reduce blood pressure. Hemorrhagic stroke: Cause: It occurs when a blood vessel in the brain ruptures, leading to bleeding in or around the brain. Hemorrhagic stroke accounts for about 13% of all strokes. Common signs include sudden severe headache, vomiting, seizures, weakness on one side of the body, and rapid neurological decline. Ischemic stroke typically presents with sudden weakness, numbness, or speech difficulties, while hemorrhagic stroke often causes a sudden severe headache, vomiting, and rapid neurological decline. The most common type is subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) , often caused by a ruptured brain aneurysm. Immediate BP control is crucial in hypertensive ICH when BP ≥ 220/130 If BP< 220/130, no aggressive BP control. Target SBP: 140-180 mmHg based on INTERACT2 and ATACH2 trials IV Nicardipine advantages: Rapid onset Titratable Predictable response Minimal side effects No sudden drops in BP Prevents hematoma expansion Reduces risk of rebleeding HTN crisis-Management priorities: Door to CT time: 20 minutes Door to CT interpretation: 45 minutes Rapid BP control Neurological monitoring Avoid sodium nitroprusside (risk of increasing ICP) Monitor for hydrocephalus and herniation ICP management with mannitol/hypertonic saline if needed Location significance: Putaminal hemorrhage: Most common site Due to lenticulostriate artery rupture Can affect internal capsule May cause hemiparesis Monitoring parameters: Continuous BP monitoring Neurological status GCS score Signs of herniation Need for airway protection Additional management: Reverse coagulopathy if present Seizure prophylaxis if indicated VTE prophylaxis Early rehabilitation planning IV Mannitol (Option A) Given if posturing/midline shift present.
