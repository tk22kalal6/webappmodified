      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: C) Pulmonary arterial hypertension; Constrictive pericarditis Explanation: The patient's skin changes, including thickened skin and telangiectasia, suggest systemic sclerosis , which often leads to pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) and constrictive pericarditis due to vascular involvement and fibrosis. Pulmonary Features in Systemic Sclerosis (SSc): Major Forms of Lung Involvement: Interstitial Lung Disease (ILD) and Pulmonary Arterial Hypertension (PAH) are the primary lung issues and leading causes of SSc-related death. The coexistence of ILD and PAH worsens survival rates significantly. Interstitial Lung Disease (ILD) : Evidence of ILD on HRCT in up to 65% of patients, with clinically significant ILD in 16–43%. Risk factors: Male sex, African-American race, diffuse skin involvement, severe GERD, and presence of Scl-70 autoantibodies. Progressive early decline in FVC (within 3–5 years). Symptoms: Exertional dyspnea, fatigue, dry cough, and Velcro crackles at lung bases. HRCT shows lower lobe subpleural reticular opacities and ground-glass opacities; the extent of ILD on HRCT predicts progression and mortality. PFTs show restrictive defects and reduced DLCO, often with exercise desaturation. Pulmonary Arterial Hypertension (PAH) : Affects 8–12% of SSc patients as a late complication, often coexisting with ILD. Defined by elevated mean pulmonary artery pressure ( ≥ 20 mmHg) with normal pulmonary capillary wedge pressure ( ≤ 15 mmHg). Risk factors: Limited cutaneous disease, older age at onset, and certain autoantibodies (e.g., anti-centromere). Symptoms progress from exertional dyspnea to angina, syncope, and right heart failure. Exam findings: Loud pulmonic component of S2, tricuspid regurgitation murmur, elevated JVP, peripheral edema. Screening: Annual echocardiography; cardiac catheterization for definitive diagnosis. Other Pulmonary Complications : Includes aspiration pneumonitis, pulmonary hemorrhage, obliterative bronchiolitis, pleural reactions, chest wall fibrosis, spontaneous pneumothorax, and increased risk of lung cancer. Cardiac Manifestations of Systemic Sclerosis (SSc): Detected in 10–50% of SSc patients, more common in diffuse cutaneous SSc (dcSSc) than limited cutaneous SSc (lcSSc). Cardiac involvement correlates with worse outcomes in SSc. Types of Involvement : Pericardial : Includes pericarditis, pericardial effusions, constrictive pericarditis, and rarely, cardiac tamponade. Myocardial : Patchy myocardial fibrosis due to microvascular involvement, vasospasm, and ischemia-reperfusion injury leading to left ventricular systolic or diastolic dysfunction and potentially heart failure. Endocardial : Often silent but may contribute to overall dysfunction. Conduction Abnormalities : Common conduction system fibrosis, with potential heart block, premature ventricular contractions, atrial fibrillation, and supraventricular tachycardia. Myocarditis : Acute or subacute myocarditis may lead to left ventricular dysfunction, best detected by cardiac MRI or endomyocardial biopsy. Tuberculosis; Congestive cardiac failure (Option A): Tuberculosis is not associated with systemic sclerosis (SSc). Congestive",

      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: C) Anti-centromere antibodies increase the risk of scleroderma renal crisis. Manifestations of Systemic Sclerosis (SSc): Scleroderma Renal Crisis (SRC): A severe complication in <15% of SSc patients, typically within the first 4 years of disease onset. Previously had a poor survival rate (<10%), now improved with ACE inhibitor treatment. Occurs more commonly in patients with topoisomerase 1 and RNP antibodies. Anti-centromere antibodies appear to reduce risk. Clinical Presentation : Commonly presents with severe accelerated hypertension (>150/90 mmHg) and oliguric acute renal failure; ~10% are normotensive but have poor outcomes. (Option A ruled out) Symptoms may include headache, blurred vision, heart failure, and pulmonary edema. Signs like tendon friction rubs, pericardial effusion, unexplained anemia, and thrombocytopenia may precede SRC. Laboratory findings: mild proteinuria, granular casts, hematuria, thrombocytopenia, and microangiopathic hemolysis. Asymptomatic Renal Impairment : It occurs in up to 50% of SSc patients and is often linked to other vascular issues but rarely leads to end-stage renal failure. Raynaud’s Phenomenon in Systemic Sclerosis (SSc): Most common extracutaneous feature in SSc. (Option B ruled out) Involves episodic vasoconstriction of fingers and toes, occasionally affecting the nose and earlobes. Triggers : Cold exposure, emotional stress, and vibration. Color Phases : Pallor : Initial vasoconstriction. Cyanosis : Ischemia of variable duration. Hyperemia : Reperfusion upon warming or spontaneously. Types of Raynaud’s disease: Primary Raynaud’s Disease : No underlying cause, normal family history, no tissue necrosis or ulceration, negative ANA test, milder symptoms. Secondary Raynaud’s Phenomenon : Associated with SSc and other connective tissue diseases, often more severe with ischemic ulcers and digital loss. Occurs at older age with more severe, frequent, prolonged, and painful episodes. Complicated by ischemic digital ulcers and possible digit loss. Nailfold Capillaroscopy : Primary Raynaud’s : Evenly spaced parallel capillary loops. Secondary Raynaud’s : Distorted, widened, irregular capillary loops, dilated lumen, microhemorrhages, and vascular dropout. Useful for distinguishing between primary and secondary forms and for early SSc diagnosis. (Option D ruled out)",

      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: C) Sine Sclerosis Explanation: Given the patient's presentation (including symptoms of Raynaud’s phenomenon , dyspnea on exertion , and gastrointestinal issues such as heartburn) and positive anti-Scl-70 antibodies with no visible skin thickening , the most likely diagnosis is Sine Sclerosis . Limited Scleroderma Diffuse Scleroderma Sine Sclerosis Most common type of scleroderma. Skin thickening is usually limited to fingers, hands, forearms, or face. (Option A ruled out) Internal organ damage is less likely, and life expectancy is typically normal. Symptoms may include gastrointestinal (GI) issues (especially heartburn), severe Raynaud’s phenomenon, and musculoskeletal pain. A small subset of patients can develop life-threatening pulmonary hypertension. Subtype - CREST Syndrome : Defined by five main features: Calcinosis : Calcium deposits under the skin or in tissues. Raynaud’s Phenomenon : Color changes, cold, numbness, or tingling in fingers/toes. Esophageal Dysmotility : Causes heartburn. Sclerodactyly : Thickened skin on fingers. Telangiectasias : Red spots from enlarged blood vessels on fingers, face, or other areas. Skin thickening over large body areas (fingers, hands, arms, anterior trunk, legs, and face). (Option B ruled out) Significant risk of organ damage (GI tract, kidneys, lungs, heart). Associated with skin dryness, itching, and musculoskeletal pain. Life-threatening when lungs or heart are severely involved. Acute, severe high blood pressure can lead to kidney damage. Presentation may include pulmonary fibrosis or issues related to the kidneys, heart, or gastrointestinal system, without any skin involvement. Raynaud's phenomenon might also be observed. Antinuclear antibodies may be detected, such as anti-Scl-70, ACA, or anti-RNA polymerase I, II, or III. Sjögren's Syndrome (Option D) is an autoimmune disorder primarily affecting moisture-producing glands, leading to dry mouth and eyes. While it could explain some symptoms, it does not account for the presence of Raynaud's phenomenon or systemic scleroderma features.

      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Correct answer: B) Immediate initiation of short-acting ace inhibitors Explanation: Short-acting ACE inhibitors are the first-line treatment for scleroderma renal crisis. This is a medical emergency requiring: Immediate hospitalization Prompt initiation of ACE inhibitors Rapid blood pressure normalization Treatment has dramatically improved survival from <10% to >60% Scleroderma Renal Crisis: Risk factors Early disease stage (<4 years) Diffuse/progressive skin involvement Anti-RNA polymerase III antibodies African-American race Male sex Glucocorticoid use Clinical presentation Accelerated hypertension (>150/90 mmHg) Progressive oliguric renal insufficiency Can be normotensive in 10% cases (worse prognosis) Microangiopathic hemolytic anemia Thrombocytopenia Warning signs Palpable tendon friction rubs Pericardial effusion New unexplained anemia Thrombocytopenia Management First-line: short-acting ACE inhibitors If needed: Angiotensin II receptor blockers Calcium channel blockers Endothelin-1 receptor blockers Up to 2/3 require dialysis 30-50% can discontinue dialysis eventually Consider a kidney transplant after 2 years of dialysis Prevention Daily BP monitoring in high-risk patients Avoid nephrotoxic drugs Limit glucocorticoids to <10 mg/day Immediate reporting of BP changes Start calcium channel blockers and taper steroids (Option A) : While useful for Raynaud's phenomenon, calcium channel blockers are not the first-line treatment for scleroderma renal crisis. They may be added if ACE inhibitors are inadequate for blood pressure control. Start plasmapheresis for suspected TTP (Option C) : While the presentation might mimic TTP with microangiopathic hemolysis and thrombocytopenia, this is characteristic of Scleroderma renal crisis. Misdiagnosing as TTP can delay appropriate treatment. Increase steroid dose to control inflammation (Option D): This would worsen the condition as glucocorticoids are a risk factor for scleroderma renal crisis. high-dose steroids (>10 mg/day) should be avoided in high-risk patients.

        "D": "Thalidomide"
      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Correct answer: B) Cyclophosphamide Explanation: Cyclophosphamide has been shown to reduce the progression of SSC-associated interstitial lung disease (ILD). It can stabilize and provide modest improvement in pulmonary function, HRCT findings, respiratory symptoms, and skin induration. While it has potential toxicity, it remains an effective option for progressive SSC-ILD. Treatment of systemic sclerosis: Disease-modifying agents Cyclophosphamide - for ILD Mycophenolate mofetil - for skin and lung involvement Tocilizumab - for skin and lung involvement Nintedanib - for SSC-ILD Vascular therapy Calcium channel blockers - for Raynaud's Angiotensin II receptor blockers Phosphodiesterase-5 inhibitors Bosentan - for digital ulcers Novel therapies Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) for severe cases Rituximab High-dose oral glucocorticoids (Option A) : While glucocorticoids may help with early inflammatory symptoms, they do not influence the progression of skin or internal organ involvement. Moreover, their use is associated with an increased risk of scleroderma renal crisis, making them potentially dangerous. Hydroxychloroquine (Option C): current literature does not well support the use of hydroxychloroquine in SSC therapy. It lacks evidence for efficacy in treating SSC-associated ILD. Thalidomide (Option D) : the use of thalidomide is not a standard treatment option for SSC-ILD. Reference: Harrison’s Principles Of Internal Medicine, 21st Edition, Volume I, Page 2783, 2784",

        "C": "Mutations in the CFTR gene",
        "D": "Eosinophilic infiltration in minor salivary glands"
      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Correct answer: B) Hypergammaglobulinemia with elevated B-cell activation Explanation: Sjogren Syndrome pathogenesis involves hyperactivity of B-cells, resulting in hypergammaglobulinemia and the production of autoantibodies (e.g., anti-Ro and anti-La). This autoimmune activity leads to chronic lymphocytic infiltration in the exocrine glands, causing dryness and inflammation of the lacrimal and salivary glands I . Pathogenesis: Sjogren Syndrome is an autoimmune disorder primarily affecting the exocrine glands. The pathogenesis involves lymphocytic infiltration (mainly T and B cells) into exocrine glands, especially the salivary and lacrimal glands. A complex interaction of genetic predisposition, environmental factors, and abnormal immune response triggers this infiltration. B-cell hyperactivity: Characterized by hypergammaglobulinemia and autoantibody production (e.g., anti-Ro/SSA and anti-La/SSB). Epithelial cell role: Exocrine gland epithelial cells may express autoantigens (Ro, La), produce pro-inflammatory cytokines, and express Toll-like receptors, facilitating immune activation I . Genetic predisposition: Certain HLA alleles (e.g., HLA-DQA1*0501) and immune-regulatory genes (IRF5, STAT4) contribute to increased susceptibility. Clinical Features: The hallmark symptoms are xerostomia (dry mouth) and keratoconjunctivitis sicca (dry eyes). Other symptoms include: Oral symptoms: Dry mouth, difficulty swallowing, increased dental caries, and parotid gland enlargement. Ocular symptoms: Gritty sensation, burning, decreased tear production. Systemic involvement: Fatigue, joint pain, Raynaud’s phenomenon, and increased risk of lymphoma, particularly marginal zone B-cell lymphoma I . CD8+ T cell infiltration in exocrine glands (Option A): CD4+ T cells predominantly infiltrate the glands in Sjogren Syndrome, not CD8+ T cells. Mutations in CFTR gene (Option C): CFTR gene mutations are associated with cystic fibrosis, not Sjogren Syndrome. Eosinophilic infiltration in minor salivary glands (Option D): Sjogren Syndrome typically shows lymphocytic rather than eosinophilic infiltration.",

      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "≥ 1 per 4 mm² area Correct answer: B) Lymphocytic foci surrounding ducts with a focus score ≥ 1 per 4 mm² area infiltration in the minor salivary glands, quantified by a focus score. This infiltration is organized into lymphocytic foci surrounding ducts and acini. Unlike other glandular conditions, the presence of these lymphocytic clusters, in patients with sicca symptoms, is highly suggestive of Sjögren syndrome, distinguishing it from conditions like sarcoidosis or IgG4-related disease. The focus score —a measure of the number of lymphocyte clusters per 4 mm² area—helps in diagnosing Sjögren syndrome when it meets or exceeds 1. Histopathology of Sjogren Syndrome: Lymphocytic focus formation: Primarily CD4+ T cells and B cells, with occasional ectopic germinal centers. Epithelial cell involvement: Glandular epithelial cells may undergo apoptosis, and they often express inflammatory markers that perpetuate immune response I (ECG). Ectopic germinal centers: These structures promote autoantibody production and enhance local autoimmune activity. lymphoid infiltration in the minor salivary gland-Sjogren Syndrome \" data-author=\"KGH assumed\" data-hash=\"11325\" data-license=\"CC BY-SA 3.0\" data-source=\"https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Sjogren%27s_syndrome_(2).jpg\"",

        "D": "NSAIDs"
      },
      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Correct answer: C) Topical cyclosporine eye drops Explanation: Topical cyclosporine eye drops are used to reduce inflammation and increase tear production in patients with Sjogren Syndrome. This treatment is effective for patients who do not respond adequately to artificial tears I . Diagnosis of Sjogren Syndrome: Diagnosis involves clinical features supported by specific tests. Clinical features: Dry eyes and/or dry mouth and/or Major salivary gland enlargement, fatigue, Raynaud’s phenomenon, arthralgias/arthritis, palpable purpura/urticarial lesions, renal tubular acidosis/MPGN, ILD/small airways disease, autoimmune cholangitis, peripheral neuropathy, MS-like lesions. Tests: Any of the following is present: Unstimulated whole saliva flow rate ≤ 0.1 mL/min Schirmer’s test ≤ 5 mm/5 min on at least one eye Ocular staining score ≥ 5 (or van Bijsterveld’s score ≥ 4) on at least one eye And, any of the following: Serum antibodies - Anti-Ro/SSA and anti-La/SSB Minor salivary gland biopsy (A labial biopsy showing lymphocytic infiltration with a focus score ≥ 1). Treatment: Treatment is largely symptomatic and involves: Ocular symptoms: Artificial tears and, if needed, topical cyclosporine for inflammation. Xerostomia: Regular sips of water and pilocarpine or cevimeline to stimulate saliva. Systemic disease: Hydroxychloroquine for mild symptoms and in severe cases, immunosuppressants like rituximab I . Oral corticosteroids (Option A) : While corticosteroids can reduce systemic inflammation, they are not typically used for local ocular symptoms in Sjogren Syndrome, especially as a next-line therapy for dry eyes.
