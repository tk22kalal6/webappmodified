Urine pH depends on the serum bicarbonate level; when serum bicarbonate is low, urine pH is less than 5.5, and vice versa. Hyperparathyroidism (Option B) can cause hypercalcemia , which leads to hypercalciuria and renal stones, but metabolic acidosis is not a feature of hyperparathyroidism. It usually presents with features of hypercalcemia, such as renal stones, osteoporosis, abdominal pain and confusion/irritability (Stones, Bones, Groans and psychiatric overtones) Hypoaldosteronism (Option C) causes hyperkalemia and less NH4+ secretion in the urine, thus causing mild metabolic acidosis. It is typically associated with urine pH< 5.5, and there is no association with renal stones.",

Fibrinoid necrosis is characteristic of malignant hypertension , indicating severe damage to the vascular structures. Malignant Hypertension: (Arteriolonephrosclerosis) It is characterized by the rapidly progressive increase in blood pressure (BP) leading to target organ damage, including: Retinal haemorrhages Encephalopathy Declining kidney function - rising creatinine and occasionally hematuria and proteinuria Cause: Activation of the RAAS and severe vasospasm due to catecholamine release. Endothelial injury can also provoke microangiopathic hemolysis. Mortality rates exceed 50% within 6 to 12 months in untreated cases. Histopathology: Fibrinoid necrosis involves the breakdown of vessel walls, accumulation of eosinophilic material (including fibrin), and a surrounding infiltration of cells. Onionskin lesions : These lesions, seen in larger interlobular arteries, exhibit hyperplastic proliferation of vascular wall cells, collagen deposition, and separation of vessel layers. These pathological changes can lead to obliteration of glomeruli and tubular structures, resulting in progressive kidney failure, often requiring dialysis for survival. Biochemical Findings: Evidence of hemolysis (anaemia, schistocytes, and reticulocytosis) Management: The primary treatment is aggressive Antihypertensive therapy. Current survival rates over five years exceed 50% with proper management. Hyaline arteriolosclerosis (Option B) is commonly associated with chronic hypertension; it is not the primary finding in malignant hypertension. Diffuse glomerulosclerosis (Option C) typically occurs in chronic kidney diseases and is characterised by scarring in the glomeruli. While it can be seen in patients with longstanding hypertension, it is not specific to the acute changes associated with malignant hypertension. Tubulointerstitial fibrosis (Option D) refers to scarring of the kidney interstitium and tubules, often seen in chronic kidney diseases. It does not represent the acute vascular changes seen in malignant hypertension, where fibrinoid necrosis is the hallmark finding.",
