      "question": "A 55-year-old man presents with gradually worsening shortness of breath and fatigue. He has a history of tuberculosis treated 10 years ago. Physical examination reveals elevated jugular venous pressure (JVP) that rises paradoxically with inspiration. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?",
      "options": {
        "A": "Pulmonary embolism",
        "B": "Restrictive cardiomyopathy",
        "C": "Right ventricular infarction",
        "D": "Constrictive pericarditis"
      },
      "correct_answer": "D",
      "explanation": "constrictive pericarditis, a condition where the pericardium, the sac surrounding the heart, becomes thickened and constricted, impeding normal heart function. The key clinical finding supporting the diagnosis is the Kussmaul sign- a paradoxical rise in JVP during inspiration . The patient's history of tuberculosis further supports the diagnosis, as tuberculosis can lead to pericardial inflammation and subsequent constriction. constrictive pericarditis\" data-author=\"\" data-hash=\"8650\" data-license=\"\" data-source=\"\" data-tags=\"April2025\" height=\"482\" src=\"https://image.prepladder.com/notes/694NK32BXWkOSziTvHqd1744296814.png\" width=\"482\" /> Kussmaul’s Sign : Abnormal rise or failure of JVP to decrease with inspiration. Classically seen in conditions like constrictive pericarditis. Also seen in pulmonary embolism, RV infarction, restrictive cardiomyopathy, and advanced systolic heart failure. While other options like restrictive cardiomyopathy, right ventricular infarction, and pulmonary embolism can also present with the Kussmaul sign, they are less likely to occur and to be involved with tuberculosis.

      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "increases with Valsalva due to dynamic left ventricular outflow tract obstruction becoming more pronounced as preload decreases. Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM): It is characterized by the thickening of the heart muscle, specifically the left ventricle, without other underlying causes like high blood pressure or aortic valve disease. Clinical Presentation: The condition is often associated with a mid systolic murmur , which is typically most pronounced at the left sternal border or near the heart's apex . This murmur results from dynamic left ventricular outflow tract obstruction and mitral regurgitation (MR). Murmur intensity increases with maneuvers that decrease preload or afterload (like standing or the Valsalva maneuver) and decreases with maneuvers that increase preload or afterload (like squatting or volume administration) . Diagnosis : Echocardiography is a key diagnostic tool for HCM. Condition Murmur Characteristics Aortic Stenosis (AS) (Option B ruled out) Systolic murmur is loudest to the right of the sternum, radiating to the neck. The intensity remains constant with maneuvers (unlike HCM). Mitral Valve Prolapse (MVP) Late systolic murmur is best heard at the apex. Typically preceded by a non-ejection click, and intensity and duration increases with maneuvers that decrease ventricular volume. Pulmonic Stenosis (PS) (Option C ruled out) Systolic murmur is best heard in the second and third intercostal spaces. Intensity increases with severity but decreases with maneuvers that decrease pulmonary blood flow. Atrial Septal Defect (ASD) (Option D ruled out) Midsystolic murmur is best heard at the left sternal border, due to increased pulmonary blood flow. Typically has fixed splitting of the second heart sound. Reference: Harrison's Principles of Internal Medicine, 21st Edition, Page 281- 286, 1821-1823, 1969",

Coarctation of the Aorta Narrowing occurs where the ductus arteriosus connects to the aorta, distal to the left subclavian artery. Causes elevated blood pressure above the narrowing (upper limbs) and reduced blood pressure below it (legs). Clinical Features Can cause cardiac failure in newborns but may be asymptomatic in older children or adults. Hypertension above narrowing may cause headaches; reduced blood flow below may lead to leg cramps or weakness. Radio-femoral delay. A continuous murmur is typically heard over the back near the left scapula. Additional sound (ejection click) may be heard in the aortic area if a bicuspid aortic valve is present. Collateral circulation develops through periscapular, internal mammary, and intercostal arteries, sometimes causing localized bruits Takayasu arteritis (Option A) is a large-vessel vasculitis that can cause pulse discrepancies and limb claudication, and does not typically present with a continuous murmur or blood pressure gradient between limbs. Atrial septal defect (Option C) causes a fixed split of the second heart sound and a systolic murmur due to increased flow across the pulmonary valve, but it does not cause blood pressure differences between the arms and legs. Aortic dissection (Option D) presents with sudden, severe chest or back pain and may cause unequal blood pressures in the arms and not associated with a continuous murmur.

      "explanation": "a loud first heart sound. First heart sound (S1): The first heart sound is due to the closing of the AV valves. It occurs at the beginning of the isovolumetric contraction as lub sound. The intensity of S1 is determined by the distance over which the anterior leaflet of the mitral valve must travel to return to its annular plane, leaflet mobility, LV contractility, and PR interval. S1 is loud in rheumatic MS, hyperkinetic circulatory states and short PR interval. Reduced LV compliance (Option A) typically affects diastolic filling but does not directly cause a loud S1; it may even reduce it in some conditions. Severe calcified mitral stenosis (Option C) leads to immobile, stiff valve leaflets , which reduce the intensity of S1, making it soft or absent , not loud. Hypertrophy of the right ventricle (Option D) may be a consequence of pulmonary hypertension due to mitral stenosis, but it does not directly affect the loudness of S1 .

      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "An S3 is due to increased ventricular filling pressure and occurs in systolic heart failure, while an S4 arises from atrial contraction against a stiff ventricle, commonly seen in diastolic dysfunction. The patient's history of ischemic cardiomyopathy and multiple comorbidities (hypertension, diabetes) further supports this diagnosis. Atrial fibrillation with mitral stenosis (Option A) : An S4 is absent in atrial fibrillation because atrial contraction is ineffective. Mitral stenosis typically causes a loud S1 and an opening snap, not an S3 or S4. Acute mitral regurgitation (Option B): Acute mitral regurgitation can cause an S3 due to rapid ventricular filling, but an S4 would be uncommon unless there is concurrent diastolic dysfunction, which is less likely in an acute setting. Severe aortic stenosis (Option D): Aortic stenosis can cause an S4 due to the stiff left ventricle. However, an S3 is less likely unless there is concurrent left ventricular failure. Isolated aortic stenosis would not explain both sounds.

Mitral stenosis (Option B): Mitral stenosis typically causes a loud S1 due to the forceful closure of a stiffened mitral valve. Tachycardia (Option D): Rapid heart rate can cause a louder S1, as the mitral valve closes more forcefully during fast cardiac cycles.

      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Wolff-Parkinson-White (WPW) Syndrome. WPW syndrome is a condition in which an accessory electrical pathway (Bundle of Kent) allows abnormal conduction of impulses from the atria to the ventricles, bypassing the normal AV node, leading to pre-excitation of the ventricles. ECG Findings: Short PR interval (<120 ms) due to rapid conduction through the accessory pathway. Delta wave: A slurred upstroke in the QRS complex, caused by pre-excitation of the ventricles. Seen in V4. Wide QRS complex due to fusion of normal and pre-excitation conduction. Types of Tachyarrhythmias Associated with WPW: Atrioventricular Reentrant Tachycardia (AVRT): The most common arrhythmia in WPW. Atrial fibrillation (AF): Can be life-threatening in WPW, with very rapid ventricular rates. Atrial Fibrillation (Option A): AF can occur in WPW but does not cause a delta wave and presents with irregular rhythm rather than the specific findings in WPW. Myocardial Infarction (Option C): MI causes ischemic changes on ECG, such as ST elevation or Q waves, but not the delta wave or short PR interval seen in WPW. Atrioventricular Nodal Reentrant Tachycardia (AVNRT) (Option D): A common type of SVT without the delta wave or short PR interval seen in WPW.

Types of S2 Splitting: Physiological Splitting: Occurs during inspiration when the increased venous return to the right side of the heart delays P2, widening the split between A2 and P2. Normal and disappears during expiration. Wide Splitting: Duration > 30msec. A2 and P2 are widely separated, and the split is exaggerated during inspiration. Causes: Pulmonic stenosis, right bundle branch block (RBBB), atrial septal defect (ASD), mitral regurgitation. Narrow Splitting: Duration < 30msec. A2 and P2 are close together, with less noticeable separation. Causes: Aortic stenosis (Option B) , systemic hypertension. Mitral regurgitation (Option A): In mitral regurgitation, the S2 sound is typically unaffected. However, an S3 sound (due to volume overload) may be heard.

Phases of Diastole: (duration: 0.5s) Phases Description Protodiastole Marks the earliest phase of diastole. Ventricular pressures drop more rapidly in a fully contracted state of ventricular musculature. Isovolumetric relaxation Ventricular musculature relaxes in an uniform pattern with both AV and semilunar valves closed. First rapid-filling phase Marks the opening of AV valves followed by rapid ventricular filling. Also known as the Passive filling phase (due to the difference in Atrial and ventricular pressures). Diastasis Pressures in the Atria and ventricles equal and ventricular filling rate declines rapidly and stops eventually. This momentary period of least ventricular filling is known as Diastasis. Last rapid filling Eject out the remaining blood left by active atrial contractions. Also known as the Active filling phase. Phases of systole (duration: 0.3s) Phases Description Isovolumetric Contraction Marks the onset of systole. Ventricles begin to contract with all valves closed , causing a rapid rise in intraventricular pressure without a change in volume. Rapid Ejection Phase Begins when ventricular pressure exceeds aortic and pulmonary artery pressure , leading to opening of semilunar valves and rapid outflow of blood from the ventricles. Reduced Ejection Phase Ventricular contraction weakens, causing ejection to slow down ; although blood still flows out, the rate decreases as pressures in the ventricles and arteries begin to equalize.",
