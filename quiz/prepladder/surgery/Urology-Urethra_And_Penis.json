      "question": "A 28-year-old male was involved in a high-speed road traffic accident. He reports severe pelvic pain and difficulty in passing urine. On examination, there is blood at the urethral meatus, and the patient complains of suprapubic tenderness. The bladder appears to be distended, and there is a high-riding prostate on a digital rectal examination. Which of the following investigations is the most appropriate to confirm the suspected injury of this patient?",
      "options": {
        "A": "Retrograde Urethrography (RGU)",
        "B": "Cystoscopy",
        "C": "Voiding Cystourethrography",
        "D": "Intravenous Pyelography (IVP)"
      },
      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: A) Retrograde Urethrography (RGU) Explanation: This clinical scenario suggests a posterior urethral injury, often linked to pelvic fractures from high-speed road traffic accidents. Retrograde Urethrography (RGU) is the preferred investigation for diagnosing posterior urethral injuries. It involves injecting contrast media into the urethra and taking X-rays to assess the injury's location and extent. Urethral injury Urethral injuries refer to damage to urethra, the tube that carries urine from the bladder to the outside of the body. Anterior vs. Posterior Urethral Injuries Feature Anterior Urethral Injury Posterior Urethral Injury Location Bulbar urethra (most common) Penile urethra Membranous urethra (bulbomembranous junction most common) Prostatic urethra Common Causes Straddle injuries Direct trauma Iatrogenic injuries (catheterization, cystoscopy) Penetrating trauma (stab/gunshot wounds) Pelvic fractures (often due to motor vehicle accidents) Blunt trauma Clinical Features Hematuria (blood in urine) Penile/perineal bruising (butterfly-shaped hematoma) Perineal pain Urinary retention or difficulty voiding Possible swelling of the penis or scrotum due to hematoma Blood at the meatus Inability to void High-riding prostate on rectal exam Perineal or suprapubic pain Pelvic hematoma associated with pelvic fractures Possible concomitant bladder injury Investigations Retrograde Urethrography (RGU) : Gold standard, shows the extent and location of injury Voiding Cystourethrography (VCUG): Used to assess urethral patency post-repair (Option C) Ultrasound: Can detect hematoma or associated injuries Retrograde Urethrography (RGU) (Option A): Gold standard for initial assessment CT Urethrography: Useful in evaluating complex injuries Pelvic CT Scan: Important for associated pelvic fractures Cystoscopy: Sometimes performed for further evaluation (Option B) If injury at Prostatomembranous junction - High lying prostate → On IVP- Pie in sky appearance",

      "question": "A 45-year-old man presents with symptoms of urinary obstruction, including difficulty in starting urination, weak urinary stream, and frequent urinary tract infections. On physical examination, he has a history of trauma to the pelvic region. A retrograde urethrogram (RGU) reveals a stricture in the anterior urethra measuring more than 2 cm. Which of the following is the most appropriate management option for this patient?",

        "C": "Excision and reconstruction with buccal mucosa",
        "D": "Urethral Stenting"
      },
      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: C) Excision and reconstruction with buccal mucosa Explanation: Urethroplasty (Surgical excision and reconstruction) is the gold standard for managing long strictures (greater than 2 cm). This surgical procedure involves removing the affected stricture segment and reconstructing the urethra using a graft taken from the buccal mucosa. Urethral Stricture Definition Abnormal narrowing of the urethra, causing partial or complete obstruction of urine flow, leading to discomfort and severe complications if untreated. Causes Trauma (Most common): Pelvic fractures, falls, accidents, or iatrogenic trauma from prolonged catheterization. Infections: STIs like gonorrhea and chlamydia causing urethritis. Medical Procedures : Urethral surgeries or radiation for pelvic cancers. Inflammatory Conditions: Chronic inflammation from conditions like lichen sclerosus. Investigations Posterior Urethral Stricture: Micturating Cystourethrogram (MCU) to visualize the posterior urethra and bladder during voiding. Anterior Urethral Stricture: Retrograde Urethrogram (RGU). Emergency Evaluation: Both RGU and MCU may be used in trauma cases or acute urinary retention. Management Urethral Dilation: Temporary relief with dilators, often leading to recurrence. (Option A) Optical Internal Urethrotomy (OIU): Endoscopic incision at the 12 o'clock position; effective for short bulbar strictures (<2 cm). (Option B) Urethroplasty: Surgical excision and reconstruction; the gold standard for recurrent or complex strictures (Option C) . Strictures up to 2 cm: Excision with end-to-end anastomosis. Strictures >2 cm: Excision and reconstruction with buccal mucosa, bladder mucosa, or penile skin. Urethral Stenting (Option D) involves placing a stent in the urethra to keep it open. While stenting can relieve obstruction temporarily, it is not a definitive treatment for strictures and may be associated with complications, such as infection and migration of the stent.",

        "D": "The Assertion is incorrect, but the Reason is correct"
      },
      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: C) The Assertion is correct, but the Reason is incorrect. Explanation: Eggplant deformity, which is characterized by significant swelling and bruising of the penile shaft, is indeed a clinical sign of penile fracture. The deformity occurs due to a tear in the tunica albuginea, the fibrous covering of the corpora cavernosa that maintains penile rigidity. The tear leads to the leakage of blood and accumulation in the surrounding tissue. Penile Fracture (Fracture of the Shaft of the Penis) Definition Rupture of the tunica albuginea surrounding the corpora cavernosa, typically due to blunt trauma to an erect penis. Clinical Features Triad Symptoms: Audible Pop or Crack: Reported during trauma. Pain: Severe at the time of injury. Swelling and Bruising: Noticeable swelling and discoloration. Eggplant Deformity : Characteristic appearance due to extensive swelling and hematoma, associated with significant pain and discoloration. Blood at Urethral Meatus: Indicates possible urethral injury. Investigations Physical Examination: Initial assessment. Ultrasound: Evaluates injury extent and hematomas. Retrograde Urethrogram (RGU): Checks for urethral injury. Management Immediate Care: Ice packs to reduce swelling Pain management with analgesics Surgical Intervention: Repair of the ruptured tunica albuginea and any urethral injury Postoperative Care: Antibiotics to prevent infection Complications Penile Deformity: Possible curvature or fibrosis. Erectile Dysfunction: Potential if injury or repair is inadequate.",

        "D": "Long-term Foley Catheterization"
      },
      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: C) Delayed Urethroplasty 3 months post-injury Explanation: Delayed urethroplasty is the gold standard for definitive management of posterior urethral injuries, typically performed 3-6 months after the injury to allow inflammation to subside, Improve surgical outcomes, and reduce the risk of complications. Management & Complications of urethral injuries Anterior Urethral Injuries Posterior Urethral Injuries Management Minor Injuries: Managed conservatively with catheterization or suprapubic catheter if severe bruising Severe Injuries: Surgical intervention like primary repair, urethroplasty, or end-to-end anastomosis Antibiotics: To prevent infection Initial Management: Suprapubic catheterization for urinary diversion Delayed Urethroplasty (Definitive management): 3-6 months post-injury after inflammation and fibrosis have subsided Primary Realignment: Occasionally attempted if conditions permit Endoscopic Realignment: For selected cases, though often reserved for acute management Complications Urethral stricture (risk of recurrence) Erectile dysfunction (especially if injury near the penile base) Urinary incontinence (less common) Infection (urethritis or abscess formation) Urethral stricture (most common long-term complication) Urinary incontinence (due to sphincter damage) Erectile dysfunction (common, due to injury near neurovascular structures) Bladder neck contracture Chronic pelvic syndrome Immediate surgical repair (Option A) is generally not recommended due to the high risk of complications like infection and stricture formation. This approach is more suitable for anterior urethral injuries. Suprapubic catheterization (Option B) is a temporary measure for diverting urine and stabilizing the patient, not a definitive treatment. Long-term Foley catheterization (Option D) is also temporary and can lead to complications; definitive surgical repair is usually required.

      "correct_answer": "D",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: D) Urethral meatus Explanation: Urethral meatus is the narrowest and least dilatable part of the entire male urethra.

      "explanation": "Correct Answer: C) Intracavernosal phenylephrine injection Explanation: Intracavernosal phenylephrine, a sympathomimetic drug, is the next step after aspiration fails. It helps to induce detumescence by constricting blood vessels and reducing blood flow into the penis. Oral phosphodiesterase inhibitors (Option A) are used to treat erectile dysfunction but are not appropriate for the acute management of priapism. Observation (Option B) may be appropriate in cases of non-ischemic priapism, but for ischemic priapism, active intervention is required.

      "explanation": "Correct Answer: B) Non-ischaemic priapism Explanation Non-ischaemic priapism is characterized by a painless erection, typically following trauma, with normal or arterial blood gas characteristics which aligns with the patient's condition. Feature Ischemic Priapism (Option A) Nonischemic Priapism Alternative Names Low-flow, Anoxic, Veno-occlusive. High-flow, Arterial. Commonality More common Less common Onset Sudden, often painful. Gradual, less painful. Etiology Associated with sickle cell disease, medications (anticoagulants, antihypertensives, antidepressants, PDE5 inhibitors, intracavernous injections, alpha-blockers, methylphenidate, atomoxetine, cocaine), blood disorders (leukemia, thalassemia, multiple myeloma, thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura). Often due to trauma (Perineal, pelvic, or penile trauma) or congenital arterial malformations. Blood Flow Decreased or absent (leading to hypoxia and acidosis) Increased (blood is well-oxygenated) Cavernosal Blood Gas Analysis Dark blood, pH <7.25, PO2 <30 mmHg, PCO2 >60 mmHg. Bright red blood, normal pH, normal PO2 and PCO2. Doppler Ultrasonography Minimal or no blood flow in the corpora cavernosa Normal to increased blood flow Urgency Medical emergency Not an emergency, often resolves spontaneously. Complications Risk of tissue damage, fibrosis and long-term erectile dysfunction. Rarely causes permanent damage. Treatment Intracavernosal sympathomimetic drugs (e.g., phenylephrine) Aspiration and irrigation. Surgical shunt or penile prosthesis if refractory. Observation Arteriography and embolization if intervention is desired. Prognosis Poor if untreated within 24-48 hours, leading to irreversible erectile dysfunction. Good, often resolves without long-term sequelae. Neurogenic priapism (Option C) , associated with spinal cord injuries, typically does not present with trauma-related symptoms and does not fit the provided clinical scenario. Recurrent priapism (Option D) refers to repeated episodes of priapism, often linked to conditions like sickle cell disease, but the patient's presentation aligns more with non-ischaemic priapism.

      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: B) Manual reduction using compression methods Explanation: Manual reduction using compression methods is the first-line treatment for paraphimosis to reduce swelling and reposition the foreskin over the glans. Paraphimosis Definition A urologic emergency where the retracted foreskin becomes trapped behind the glans, leading to potential complications like strangulation, vascular compromise and necrosis. Etiology Iatrogenic causes (e.g., catheterization, cystoscopy, routine cleaning) Penile trauma Self-inflicted injuries Pathophysiology Impaired venous and lymphatic drainage when the foreskin is retracted for an extended period leads to reduced arterial blood flow leading to ischemia and potential necrosis if untreated. Symptoms Swelling and pain in the glans and foreskin. Erythema (redness) Diagnosis Based on history of foreskin retraction and physical examination showing the glans and a constricting band of tissue. Treatment Manual Reduction: Compression methods to reduce swelling and Osmotic agents (e.g., sugar or mannitol) to reduce edema. Surgical Options: Dorsal slit procedure to relieve pressure and circumcision for recurrent paraphimosis. Circumcision (Option A ) is an option for recurrent paraphimosis but is not the immediate initial management in an acute case. Topical corticosteroids (Option C) are used for treating phimosis but are not effective in the acute management of paraphimosis. Oral antibiotics (Option D) may be necessary if there is an infection, but they are not the primary treatment for paraphimosis.

      "explanation": "Correct Answer: C) Pathologic phimosis Explanation: Pathologic phimosis is characterized by a non-retractable foreskin with a fibrotic ring (cicatrix) and symptoms such as pain, irritation, and dysuria, which fits the patient's presentation. Feature Physiologic Phimosis (Option A) Pathologic Phimosis (Option C) Overview Inability to retract the foreskin due to congenital adhesions. Common in newborns and young boys Resolves spontaneously over time with normal penile growth and erections. Nonretractable foreskin due to scarring or fibrosis of the prepuce. Less common, typically occurs in older children or adults. Does not resolve spontaneously, often worsens without intervention. Onset Present at birth, with gradual improvement. May develop after trauma, infection, inflammation, or forcible retraction. Symptoms Typically asymptomatic, occasional mild discomfort during retraction. Pain, irritation, bleeding, dysuria, painful erections, recurrent infections. Appearance of Prepuce Normal appearance, foreskin adhered to glans. Presence of fibrotic ring (cicatrix) around the preputial orifice and white scarring. Management No treatment needed for most cases. Stretching exercises and topical corticosteroids if concerned. Surgical options like preputioplasty, dilation, or circumcision if severe. Complications Uncommon High risk of complications such as paraphimosis, recurrent UTIs, or balanitis xerotica obliterans (BXO). Paraphimosis (Option B) occurs when a retracted foreskin cannot be returned to its normal position, leading to a constricting band around the glans, but this does not match the description of a fibrotic ring and non-retractable foreskin. Balanitis (Option D) refers to inflammation of the glans penis, usually presenting with redness, swelling, and pain, but it does not involve a non-retractable foreskin with a fibrotic ring.

      },
      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer : C) Posterior urethral valves Explanation Posterior urethral valves are characterized by membranous folds in the posterior urethra leading to urinary obstruction, which matches the \"keyhole sign\" on ultrasound and the postnatal symptoms of urinary retention and lethargy. Posterior urethral valves Definition Urinary tract obstruction in male infants from membranous folds in the posterior urethra. Complications Chronic kidney disease, pulmonary hypoplasia from oligohydramnios. Classification Type I: Posterior urethral folds Type II: Membranes at bladder neck Type III: Round membrane at verumontanum Etiology Congenital, unclear embryological origin. Pathophysiology Increased bladder pressure → hypertrophy, vesicoureteric reflux, renal damage Diagnostic Tools Ultrasound, VCUG (voiding cystourethrogram) and Renal scintigraphy. Antenatal Diagnosis Ultrasound: Dilated bladder (\"keyhole sign\"), thickened walls. Postnatal Symptoms Urinary retention, infections, lethargy, respiratory distress. Management Antenatal: Vesicostomy, fetal valve ablation Postnatal: Stabilization, cystoscopic ablation Prognosis Depends on severity; long-term care needed for CKD, bladder dysfunction, recurrent UTIs. Hypospadias (Option A) involves an abnormal urethral opening and does not present with the obstructive symptoms described, such as a distended bladder and urinary retention. Vesicoureteral reflux (Option B) can occur secondary to posterior urethral valves but is not the primary condition associated with the described ultrasound findings and symptoms. Neurogenic bladder (Option D) results from nerve damage affecting bladder function, but it is not typically associated with the \"keyhole sign\" seen in posterior urethral valves.

      "explanation": "Correct Answer: C) Epispadias Explanation : Epispadias Congenital condition where the urethral opening is located on the dorsal (top) side of the penis (in males) or the clitoris (in females). Male Epispadias : Urethral opening on the top of the penis. Female Epispadias : Urethral opening located on the clitoris or along the dorsal side of the urethra. Associated with bladder exstrophy. Clinical features : Difficulty urinating, recurrent urinary tract infections, Undescended testis, Bifid clitoris, Widely separated labia, Urinary incontinence. Treatment : Modified Cantwell-Ransley repair and Mitchell repair. Epispadias repairs must deal with correction of the dorsal chordee and curvature, Dissection of the corpora and lengthening them by medial rotation, Urethral reconstruction for urination and ejaculation, Reconstruction of the glans penis. Hypospadias (Option A) : Congenital condition where the urethral opening is on the underside of the penis and not on the top side of penis. Peyronie Disease (Option B) : Characterized by the development of fibrous plaques in the penile tissue. It affects penile shape and function but not the position of the urethral opening. Phimosis (Option D) : Condition where the foreskin cannot be retracted over the glans (head) of the penis. This is not related to the position of the urethral opening.",

      },
      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: A) Hypospadias Explanation: Hypospadias: It is a congenital condition in which the urethral opening is located on the ventral (underside) of the penis, and in severe cases, may be found as far back as the perineum . Associated with abnormal urination , spraying , or downward deflection of urine. Can lead to recurrent UTIs due to poor urinary stream and stasis. Often associated with chordee (ventral penile curvature). Feature Description Definition A congenital anomaly where the urethral meatus opens on the ventral side (underside) of the penis instead of the tip Location of Meatus Anywhere along the ventral shaft , scrotum, or perineum (in severe cases) Types Glanular (near glans) Coronal Penile Penoscrotal Perineal Associated Abnormalities Chordee (ventral penile curvature) Incomplete foreskin (dorsal hood) Undescended testes (in some cases) Clinical Features Abnormal urinary stream Spraying or dribbling of urine May be noticed during urination or circumcision Recurrent UTIs (in severe cases) Diagnosis Clinical examination at birth Imaging (USG KUB, VCUG) if suspected associated anomalies or recurrent UTIs Differential Diagnoses Epispadias (dorsal meatus) Exstrophy of bladder Disorders of sexual development (if associated genital ambiguity) Management Avoid neonatal circumcision (foreskin may be needed for repair) Surgical correction ideally between 6–18 months of age Surgical Goals Position urethral meatus at the glans tip Straighten the penis (correct chordee) Create cosmetically normal appearance Prognosis Excellent with early surgical correction Most children have normal voiding and sexual function later in life Epispadias (Option B) is incorrect because the urethral opening is on the dorsal (upper) surface of the penis, not the perineum. It may also present with urinary incontinence, but is not consistent with the described perineal opening. Ectopic vesicae (Option C) is incorrect because it refers to exstrophy of the bladder , where the bladder is exposed outside the abdominal wall. It is typically diagnosed at birth and presents with visible bladder mucosa. Phimosis (Option D) is incorrect because it refers to the inability to retract the foreskin over the glans penis. It does not cause a displaced urethral opening and is not associated with an opening on the perineum.",

Orthoplasty : Correction of penile curvature and any associated penile shaft issues. This step involves mobilizing and repositioning the urethral plate if necessary. Urethroplasty : Creation or reconstruction of the neourethra using tissue flaps or grafts to form a functional urethra. Meatoplasty: Providing vascularised coverage for the urethroplasty. Glanuloplasty : Reconstruction of the glans penis, focusing on creating a normal appearance and aligning the meatus. Penoplasty : Reconstruction of the penile shaft to restore or enhance its normal appearance and function. This may involve skin flaps or grafts. Scrotoplasty : Correction or reconstruction of the scrotum, which may be necessary if there are associated anomalies or for cosmetic reasons. Reference: Steps in Hypospadias repair",

      "explanation": "Correct Answer: B) Glanular hypospadias Explanation: Hypospadias: Caused by failure of fusion of urethral folds- meatus in ventral aspect Affects about 1 in 300 male live births, Most common congenital abnormality of the urethra. Characterized by: Ectopic ventrally located urethral meatus, Ventral penile curvature (chordee), Incomplete dorsal hood prepuce. Classification/Types: Glanular Hypospadias: Most common type (Option B) Coronal Hypospadias Penile Hypospadias Penoscrotal Hypospadias Perineal Hypospadias Scrotal Hypospadias Distal penile Hypospadias Glandular, Coronal and Distal penile hypospadias account for 60-70% of cases of hypospadias. Treatment usually involves tubularized incised plate urethroplasty. Two-stage repair : First corrects penile curvature, second repairs urethra, Typically done before 18 months of age. Circumcision should be avoided to preserve preputial skin for future repairs. Failed repair can result in urethrocutaneous fistula.
