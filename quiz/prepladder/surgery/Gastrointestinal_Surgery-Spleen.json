      "explanation": "Correct Answer: C) It develops from the mesenchymal cells of the ventral mesogastrium. embryogenesis. Anatomy of spleen: Weight: 75 to 250 gm (Option A ruled out) Location: left hypochondrium, along the axis of the 10th rib. (Option B ruled out) It is an intraperitoneal organ. (Option D ruled out) Largest lymphatic organ In a healthy adult, the spleen is not usually palpable. It becomes palpable when the size increases by more than 2.5 times. Suspended by two ligaments: lienorenal ligament and gastrosplenic ligament. Relations of the spleen: Related to the 9th, 10th, and 11th rib, with its long axis along the 10th rib. It is related to the fundus of the stomach, the tail of the pancreas, the splenic flexure of the colon, and the anterior surface of the left kidney on it’s visceral surface. Two important ligaments that keep it in place are gastrosplenic and splenorenal ligaments . Physiology: Hematopoietic: During embryonic development. Reservoir: It pools in platelets Filtration: removal of senescent cells, cellular inclusions (RBC nucleoli), and parasites, and the sequestration of RBCs (for maturation). Immunity: It processes foreign antigens and is the major site of specific immunoglobulin (IgM) production. Synthesis of non-specific opsonins, properdin and tuftsin takes place.",

      "question": "A 45-year-old male is planned for an elective splenectomy due to hereditary spherocytosis. Which of the following vaccination strategies is most appropriate to prevent infections post-splenectomy?",
      "options": {
        "A": "10-12 weeks before surgery",
        "B": "Only if the patient shows signs of infection",
        "C": "Delay all vaccinations until 6 months after surgery",
        "D": "At least one week before the surgery"
      },
      "correct_answer": "D",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: D) At least one week before the surgery Explanation: At least one week before the surgery is the correct and most evidence-based timing for vaccination before elective splenectomy. This allows the patient’s immune system sufficient time to generate protective antibody responses, especially against encapsulated organisms , which pose a serious infection risk after splenectomy. Key vaccines to administer: Pneumococcal vaccine (preferably PCV13 followed by PPSV23) Haemophilus influenzae type B (Hib) vaccine Meningococcal vaccine (covering groups A, C, W, and Y; MenB as needed) Annual influenza vaccination is also recommended Vaccination Recommendations for Asplenic Patients: Vaccine Children Adults ( ≥ 19 years) Pneumococcal PCV13 → PPSV23 (8 weeks later) → Repeat PPSV23 after 5 years PCV13 → PPSV23 (8 weeks later) → Repeat PPSV23 every 5 years Meningococcal MenACWY series + MenB series MenACWY or MPSV4 (2 doses, 2 months apart) → Repeat MenACWY every 5 years + MenB series once Haemophilus influenzae type b Single dose if ≥ 15 months and unvaccinated Single dose if not previously vaccinated Timing of Vaccination: Scenario Recommendation Elective splenectomy (ideal) 10–12 weeks before surgery (optimal for immune response) Elective splenectomy (minimum) At least 2 weeks before surgery Emergency splenectomy At hospital discharge or 14 days post-op, whichever comes first Additional CDC-Recommended Vaccinations: As per CDC 2020 guidelines , the following should also be considered based on age and risk factors: Influenza (annually) Tdap or Td HPV MMR Varicella Zoster Hepatitis A and B Key Points: Encapsulated organisms (e.g., Streptococcus pneumoniae , Neisseria meningitidis , Haemophilus influenzae ) pose high infection risk post-splenectomy. Vaccination significantly reduces the risk of Overwhelming Post-Splenectomy Infection (OPSI) . Booster doses and lifelong follow-up are essential. 10–12 weeks before surgery (Option A) is incorrect because such an early window is not necessary . Vaccines should ideally be administered at least 2 weeks before elective splenectomy, with a minimum of 1 week still being acceptable. Only if the patient shows signs of infection (Option B) is incorrect because vaccines are prophylactic , not therapeutic. Waiting for infection defeats their preventive purpose. Delay all vaccinations until 6 months after surgery (Option C) is incorrect because this would leave the patient highly susceptible to life-threatening infections , especially overwhelming post-splenectomy infection (OPSI), during the critical early period post-op.",

      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: A) Equal incidence in both males and females Explanation: Acute ITP typically presents in children under the age of 5 and affects both males and females equally. The sudden onset of petechiae, purpura, and spontaneous bleeding are characteristic features. Immune Thrombocytopenic Purpura (ITP) Definition : An autoimmune disease where antibodies attack platelet membrane glycoproteins, leading to isolated thrombocytopenia. Types : Acute ITP : Occurs in children. Chronic ITP : Occurs in adults. Clinical Features Chronic ITP : More common in women aged 15-50. Can affect any age or sex. Acute ITP : Typically presents before age 5. Affects males and females equally. (Option A) Symptoms : Skin & Mucous Membranes : Purpuric patches (ecchymoses), petechial hemorrhages. Mucous Membranes : Spontaneous bleeding (e.g., epistaxis). Women : Menorrhagia. General : Prolonged bleeding from minor wounds. Diagnosis of ITP Diagnostic Feature Finding Palpable Spleen Uncommon in ITP; may suggest an alternative diagnosis Coagulation Studies Normal Bleeding Time Tests Not useful in diagnosing ITP Cutaneous Ecchymoses Present Tourniquet Test Positive Complete Blood Count Reduced platelet count (< 60 x 10 I /L) Bone Marrow Aspiration Increased megakaryocytes Renal dysfunction (Option C) : is not a feature of ITP but is more characteristic of conditions like Hemolytic Uremic Syndrome (HUS) or Thrombotic Thrombocytopenic Purpura (TTP). Hemolytic anemia and jaundice (Option D) : are associated with conditions like TTP or HUS, not ITP, where isolated thrombocytopenia is the primary finding.

      "question": "A 45-year-old patient presents with persistent petechiae, frequent nosebleeds, and heavy menstrual bleeding over the past 7 months. She is being considered for splenectomy. Which statement accurately reflects the current approach to this treatment?",
      "options": {
        "A": "Laparoscopic splenectomy is preferred.",
        "B": "Long-term steroid therapy is the primary approach.",
        "C": "Approximately 50% of patients will achieve complete remission post-splenectomy.",
        "D": "All patients receive pre-splenectomy transfusions immediately"
      },
      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: A) Laparoscopic splenectomy is preferred. Explanation: The patient's symptoms—persistent petechiae, frequent nosebleeds, and heavy menstrual bleeding—suggest chronic immune thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP) . Chronic ITP is defined by a platelet count below normal for more than 6 months. Laparoscopic splenectomy is increasingly preferred due to its minimally invasive nature. In ITP, the spleen is usually normal or slightly enlarged, making laparoscopic techniques suitable. Important to identify and remove splenunculi (accessory spleens) to prevent recurrence. Treatment for ITP Acute ITP Common in children. Often resolves without treatment. Short courses of corticosteroids are effective. Prolonged steroid therapy is not recommended. Chronic ITP(>6 months) Typically affects adults. Corticosteroids are used but prolonged use is not advised. (Option B ruled out) For refractory or relapsing cases, splenectomy is generally recommended. Splenectomy Outcomes Complete remission~66% (two-thirds) (Option C ruled out) Some improvement- 15% Predictors of Success Response to steroids: Good responders are more likely to benefit from splenectomy if the disease recurs. Pre-Splenectomy Considerations Transfusions May be necessary before a splenectomy. Typically not administered until splenic vessels are controlled.

      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: C) Secondary cysts Explanation: Secondary cysts (pseudocysts) lack an epithelial lining and often develop following trauma. They typically contain serous or hemorrhagic fluid and may have calcified walls that resemble hydatid cysts on imaging. Categories: Primary (True) Cysts: Characteristics: Presence of an epithelial lining. Types: Dermoid Cysts: Derived from embryonal rests. (Option D ruled out) Mesenchymal Inclusion Cysts: Includes cystic hemangiomas, cystic lymphangiomas, epidermoid and dermoid cysts. (Option A, Option B ruled out) Secondary Cysts (Pseudocysts): Characteristics: No epithelial lining; often develop post-trauma. Content: Serous or hemorrhagic fluid. Appearance: May have calcified walls, resembling hydatid cysts on imaging. Management: True Cysts> 5 cm: Treatment: Splenectomy or partial splenectomy. Pseudocysts: Diagnosis: Typically through imaging. Treatment: Intervention only if symptomatic or persistent after observation. Overall, the most common splenic cyst is Pseudocyst.
