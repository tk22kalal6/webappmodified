      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: B) Contaminated Explanation: Open cardiac massage is classified as Category 3 due to a significant breach in sterile technique. It is generally performed in situations of inadequate cardiac output, following emergency thoracotomy for penetrating chest trauma, during pericardial tamponade, or in cases of cardiac arrest after recent chest surgery. Classification of Wounds: Classification Description Class I Clean An uninfected operative wound with no inflammation and no entry into the respiratory, alimentary, genital, or uninfected urinary tracts. Wounds are primarily closed, and drainage is closed if needed. Class II Clean-Contaminated An operative wound where the respiratory, alimentary, genital, or urinary tracts are entered under controlled conditions without unusual contamination. Includes operations like biliary tract, appendix, vagina, and oropharynx. Class III Contaminated Open, fresh accidental wounds or operations with major breaks in sterile technique (open cardiac massage) or gross spillage from the gastrointestinal tract , with acute non-purulent inflammation. Class IV Dirty-Infected Old traumatic wounds with retained devitalized tissue, clinical infection, or perforated viscera. The organisms causing postoperative infection were already present in the operative field before the operation. Reference: Sabiston Textbook of Surgery, 21st Edition, Page 225",

        "D": "Recurrent breast cancer"
      },
      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: A) Lymphangiosarcoma Explanation: Lymphangiosarcoma is the most likely cause of these symptoms, especially in a patient with a history of mastectomy. This condition, also known as Stewart-Treves syndrome , can develop years after mastectomy due to long-standing lymphedema, which is a consequence of lymphatic obstruction. Complications of mastectomy: Complications Explanations Lymphedema Swelling is caused by the accumulation of lymph fluid in the arm or chest wall due to the removal of lymph nodes.(After MRM and axillary dissection) Wound infection/Flap necrosis Postoperative infections where blackening of suture line is seen (flap necrosis), if necrosed site note removed, leads to wound infection Post-Mastectomy Pain Syndrome Chronic pain in the chest or upper arm due to nerve damage or scar tissue formation. Nerve Injuries Long thoracic nerve- injury leads to winging of the scapula Thoracodorsal nerve Lymphangiosarcoma Stewart-Treves syndrome - Cancerous growth in the lymphatic vessels, often associated with long-standing lymphedema. After an average of 10.5 years following MRM and radiotherapy, the patient develops angiosarcoma Thoracic Outlet Syndrome (Option B) is characterised by symptoms such as pain, paraesthesia, oedema, cyanosis, cold extremities, and weakness in the hands. Chronic Venous Insufficiency (Option C) typically presents with postural discomfort, varicose veins, oedema, skin pigmentation, induration, dermatitis, lipodermatosclerosis, and ulceration. Recurrent Breast Cancer (Option D) usually presents with a palpable lump, nipple retraction, swelling of lymph nodes, and signs of metastasis.

      "question": "A patient presents to the emergency room after a road traffic accident with shock and hypotension. The extended focused assessment with sonography for trauma (eFAST) is negative, the X-ray is normal, and the ECG shows no abnormalities. The patient's SpO2 is 93%, blood pressure is 80/60 mmHg, and pulse rate is 40/min. Based on this information, what type of shock is most likely?",
      "options": {
        "A": "Septic shock",
        "B": "Hemorrhagic shock",
        "C": "Cardiogenic shock",
        "D": "Neurogenic shock"
      },
      "correct_answer": "D",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: D) Neurogenic shock Explanation: Neurogenic shock is characterized by hypotension, bradycardia (low pulse rate), and normal or slightly reduced SpO2. The absence of trauma to solid organs, negative eFAST, and normal X-rays help rule out hemorrhagic or cardiogenic shock. The bradycardia (pulse of 40/min) is due to a loss of sympathetic tone following spinal cord injury or severe trauma, leading to vasodilation and bradycardia. Neurogenic shock: In neurogenic shock, there is a loss of sympathetic tone, leading to vasodilation of the peripheral vasculature, resulting in decreased peripheral vascular resistance and hypotension. This is the primary mechanism underlying neurogenic shock. Causes: Neurogenic shock is a critical condition that results from the dysregulation of the autonomic nervous system following spinal cord injury, especially in the cervical and upper thoracic vertebrae above the T6 level, as a result of traumatic events. The dysregulation arises due to the lack of sympathetic tone and decreased peripheral vascular resistance. The decline in sympathetic tone prompts the dilation of capacitance blood vessels in the lower extremities. This, in turn, results in decreased cardiac filling, leading to hypotension and shock. Reduced sympathetic control over the heart leads to a situation where unopposed vagal cardiac influence causes bradycardia. Patients with neurogenic shock may also exhibit pink and warm skin due to the dilation of subcutaneous blood vessels. Severe brain injury. Certain anaesthetics. Pathophysiology Clinical Manifestations: Hypotension Bradycardia (unlike other forms of shock) Warm, dry skin below injury level Priapism in males Respiratory compromise (if high cervical injury) Poikilothermia (inability to regulate body temperature) Physiological Hemodynamic Characteristics of Shock Type of Shock Cardiac Output Systemic Vascular Resistance Central Venous Pressure Mean Arterial Pressure Hypovolemic ↓ ↑ ↓ ↓ Cardiogenic ↓ ↑ ↑ ↓ Distributive(Septic, anaphylactic, neurogenic) ↑ or ↓ ↓ ↓ or N ↓ Obstructive (pulmonary embolism, cardiac tamponade, tension pneumothorax) ↓ ↑ ↑ ↓",

      "question": "In patients at risk of refeeding syndrome, which of the following electrolyte imbalances is typically not associated with this condition?",
      "options": {
        "A": "Hypokalemia",
        "B": "Hyperkalemia",
        "C": "Hypocalcemia",
        "D": "Hypophosphatemia"
      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: B) Hyperkalemia Explanation: Hyperkalemia is not typically associated with refeeding syndrome. In fact, potassium levels usually decrease during refeeding, contributing to hypokalemia. Refeeding syndrome: One of the most significant metabolic complications of both parenteral and enteral feeding. This occurs in the first days after feeding is commenced in patients who have been severely malnourished. The patient is considered to be at risk of developing refeeding syndrome with EITHER. One or more of the following: (OR) Two or more of the following: BMI <16 kg/m 2 BMI <18.5 kg/m 2 Unintentional weight loss >15% within the last 3-6 months Unintentional weight loss >10% within the last 3-6 months. Little or no nutritional intake for more than 10 days Little or no nutritional intake for more than 5 days. Low potassium, phosphate or magnesium levels prior to feeding History of alcohol abuse or on medication, including insulin, chemotherapy, antacids or diuretics. Mechanism of Refeeding Syndrome: Electrolyte abnormalities: Hypophosphatemia (Option D) Hypomagnesemia Hypokalemia (Option A) Hypocalcemia (Option C) This leads to arrhythmia, confusion, and respiratory failure, ultimately leading to death. Management: Matching the intake with requirements. Avoid overfeeding Calorie delivery should be increased slowly Vitamin administration (Thiamine): Given before feeding. Electrolyte abnormalities should be corrected Reference: Bailey & Love's Short Practice of Surgery, 28th Edition, Page 340",

        "D": "Cellulitis"
      },
      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: A) Gas gangrene Explanation: Gas gangrene is caused by Clostridium species, typically after traumatic injuries, especially with crush wounds or amputation. It is characterized by crepitus (gas production), reddish-brown discoloration of the wound, and rapid progression within days. Gas Gangrene A rapidly progressive, potentially fatal condition characterized by widespread necrosis of muscles and soft-tissue destruction, often due to late-presenting missile wounds or crushing injuries. Cause Clostridium perfringens Incubation period <24 hours but ranges from 1 hour to 6 weeks Sources and predisposing factors Contaminated soil and feces. Wounds with necrotic or foreign material. Crush wounds, road traffic accidents, amputations. Anaerobic environments in the wound. Common sites of infection Adductor region of the lower limb and buttocks. Subscapular region in the upper limb. Clinical features Severe pain with limb swelling rapidly increases in severity. Serosanguineous discharge. Skin turns brown to blue-black with hemorrhagic bullae. Sweet, sticky odor & Soft-tissue crepitus. Complication Septicaemia, toxemia, renal failure, liver failure. Circulatory failure, DIC, secondary infections. Death occurs in critically ill patients. Investigation X-ray: Gas in soft tissues. Gram stain & blood culture: Large Gram-positive bacilli without neutrophils. Biochemical profile: Metabolic acidosis, renal failure. Peripheral blood smear: Haemolysis. CT scan for chest or abdominal wounds. Treatment High-dose intravenous penicillin and clindamycin, along with 3rd generation cephalosporins, are given intravenously. Polyvalent antiserums given intravenously. All dead tissues are excised, and debridement is performed until healthy tissue bleeds. Amputation done in severe cases Hyperbaric oxygen therapy. Prevention Proper debridement of devitalized crushed wounds. Devitalized wounds should not be sutured. Adequate cleaning of wounds with H I O I and normal saline. Penicillin - As a prophylactic antibiotic. Image Incorrect Options: Impetigo (Option B) is a superficial skin infection caused by Streptococcus or Staphylococcus bacteria, presenting as honey-colored crusts, but does not typically cause crepitus or involve deep tissue. Tetanus (Option C) results from infection with Clostridium tetani , leading to muscle stiffness and spasms. While it follows a traumatic injury, it doesn’t typically present with crepitus or reddish-brown wound discoloration. Cellulitis (Option D) is a bacterial skin infection that causes redness, swelling, and warmth, but it does not produce crepitus or reddish-brown wounds and typically develops over a longer period.",

      },
      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: C) Hemostasis, inflammation, proliferation, remodeling Explanation: Wound healing occurs in four stages : hemostasis , inflammation , proliferation , and remodeling . Hemostasis: Occurs immediately after injury: vasoconstriction, platelet aggregation, and clot formation. Platelets release growth factors (e.g., TGF- β , PDGF , VEGF ) that promote matrix deposition, chemotaxis, and angiogenesis. Coagulation cascade leads to thrombin formation, stabilizing the platelet plug. Inflammation: Early Phase (Days 1-2): Neutrophils clear debris and fight infection. Vasoactive amines increase vascular permeability. Late Phase (Days 2-3): Macrophages debride the wound, release growth factors, and promote fibroblast and angiogenesis. Cardinal signs: rubor (redness), tumor (swelling), calor (heat), dolor (pain). Proliferation: Days 3-14: Fibroblasts produce collagen and extracellular matrix. Granulation tissue forms, and angiogenesis occurs. Myofibroblasts help contract the wound and bring edges together. Remodelling: Weeks to months: Type III collagen is replaced by stronger type I collagen . The wound reaches about 80% of normal skin strength by 12 weeks and continues to mature for up to a year.

      },
      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: C) Serosanguinous drainage from the wound Explanation: Serosanguinous drainage from the wound is considered a \"sure sign\" of abdominal wound dehiscence in a post-operative hypotensive patient (Salmon fluid sign) Wound dehiscence is the disruption of any or all layers of a wound. It occurs in up to 3% of abdominal wounds and is associated with an increased risk of postoperative mortality. Timing and Presentation: Wound dehiscence typically occurs 5 to 8 days postoperatively when the strength of the wound is at its weakest. It often presents with serosanguinous discharge and may be preceded by a popping sensation felt by the patient, particularly during activities like straining or coughing. The dehiscence may also indicate an underlying abscess. Risk factors: Poor wound closure or closure under tension Infection , hematoma , or seroma at the wound site Increased intra-abdominal pressure , e.g., in postoperative patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) or excessive coughing Malnourishment Diabetes Obesity Renal failure Jaundice Sepsis Cancer Steroid use Emergency surgery Management: Full-thickness dehiscence generally requires the patient to return to the operating room for resuturing. In cases of infected tissues, poor-quality tissue, or wounds under excessive tension, the wound may be left open and managed with dressings or vacuum-assisted closure (VAC) .

        "A": "Radiotherapy",
        "B": "Combined chemoradiotherapy",
        "C": "Wide local excision with negative borders",
        "D": "Wide local excision with frozen section"
      },
      "correct_answer": "D",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: D) Wide local excision with negative borders Explanation: Wide local excision with frozen section is the treatment of choice for early-stage squamous cell carcinoma of the lower lip in patients with no lymph node involvement. This technique ensures that the excision margins are clear in real-time, reducing the risk of recurrence. Cutaneous Squamous Cell Carcinoma (SCC): SCC is a malignant tumor of keratinising cells in the epidermis, commonly arising from the stratum basalis. It is the second most common skin cancer, more prevalent in fair-skinned individuals with chronic sun exposure. Risk factors: UV radiation , chronic inflammation, immunosuppression , chemical carcinogens (e.g., arsenic), and HPV infection (types 5 and 16). Tobacco use doubles the risk. Precursor lesions: Actinic Keratosis (AK) : Dysplastic lesions from sun damage; 20% progress to SCC. Keratin Horns : Raised keratinous surface from AK, 10% may have underlying SCC. Keratoacanthomas : Rapidly growing, nodular tumors that resemble SCC and should be excised. Clinical features: SCC presents as nodular, verrucous, or ulcerating lesions with an everted edge and surrounding induration. Differential diagnosis : AK, BCC, pyoderma gangrenosum, and warts. Microscopic features: Irregular squamous epithelium invading the dermis, positive for cytokeratins 1 and 10 . Broders' grading assesses tumor differentiation. Management: The primary treatment for SCC is surgical excision , which provides accurate histological diagnosis and clear margins . The size of the SCC influences the required margin: <2 cm SCC : 4 mm margin >2 cm SCC : 1 cm margin The recurrence rate is approximately 20% . Surgical excision is the only reliable method for ensuring clear margins. Mohs’ micrographic surgery may be indicated for difficult-to-resect tumours or those with recurrent SCC.

      "explanation": "Correct Answer: B) Breast abscess Explanation: A breast abscess is a localized collection of pus within the breast tissue, most commonly seen in lactating women. The patient's clinical presentation, including a fluctuant mass, high fever, and localized tenderness, strongly suggests this diagnosis. Breast Abscess Definition Pus-filled cavity within breast tissue. Types Lactational Abscess: Associated with breastfeeding. Non-Lactational Abscess: Occurs in non-lactating women, e.g., periductal mastitis. Causes and Risk Factors Lactation: Incidence: 3% to 20% in lactating mothers. Common pathogen: Staphylococcus aureus (methicillin-resistant strains in hospital settings). Entry points: Cracked/retracted nipple, blocked lactiferous ducts. Non-Lactation: Often in nulliparous women or post-lactation. Conditions: Periductal mastitis, idiopathic granulomatous mastitis, tubercular mastitis. Smoking and diabetes as risk factors. Signs and symptoms Fever, leukocytosis, erythema, pain and tenderness, swelling, malaise, difficulty feeding, enlarged and tender axillary nodes Diagnosis Ultrasonography: Detects cellulitis, liquefaction necrosis. Confirms abscess size, location, and loculation. Treatment Lactational Mastitis: Antibiotics: Anti-staphylococcal (e.g., cloxacillin, flucloxacillin, erythromycin). Breast emptying: Frequent breastfeeding or pumping. Support: Breast support garment, cold compresses, analgesia. Drainage: Ultrasound-guided preferred over surgical incision. Follow-up: Regular clinical and ultrasonographic reviews, culture-based antibiotic modification. Non-Lactational Mastitis: Broad-spectrum antibiotics for subareolar infections. Needle aspiration for abscess drainage. Major milk duct excision for complications like sepsis or fistula. Incorrect Options: Breast engorgement (Option A) is not associated with a fluctuant mass, high fever, or localized pain. Acute mastitis (Option C) can cause breast pain and swelling, but it typically does not present as a fluctuant mass.

      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: A) Allen’s test Explanation: The given image shows Allen’s test. Allen's Test is a clinical manoeuvre used to assess the blood flow to the hand, specifically evaluating the patency of the radial and ulnar arteries. It is commonly used before procedures like inserting an arterial line or taking a blood sample from the radial artery. Procedure: The patient is asked to make a fist, compressing the radial and ulnar arteries simultaneously. The patient is then asked to open their hand (which should appear pale). Once the hand is open, the examiner releases one of the arteries (usually the ulnar artery). The test is positive if normal colour returns to the hand quickly (within 5-10 seconds), indicating adequate collateral circulation. If there is a delay in the colour return or no return, this may suggest compromised blood flow through the released artery, which could indicate arterial occlusion & the radial artery should not be pricked. Adson's test (Option B) is used to diagnose thoracic outlet syndrome (TOS), which occurs due to compression of the brachial plexus or subclavian artery in the thoracic outlet. The patient is instructed to extend their neck and turn their head toward the arm being tested while the examiner palpates the radial pulse. The patient then takes a deep breath. A positive test is indicated by a reduction or disappearance of the radial pulse, suggesting compression in the thoracic outlet. Elevated Arm Stress Test (Option C) evaluates thoracic outlet syndrome by assessing the compression of neurovascular structures in the thoracic outlet. The patient’s arms are raised above the head and held for 1-2 minutes. A positive test occurs if the patient experiences symptoms of numbness, tingling, or a decrease in the radial pulse, which indicates compression of the neurovascular bundle in the thoracic outlet. Nicoladoni's test (Option D) is used to assess for increased intracranial pressure (ICP) or brainstem compression . The test is positive if the patient exhibits a sudden drop in pulse or blood pressure when their head is tilted backwards (in a hyperextended position).",

      },
      "correct_answer": "D",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: D) 1, 3, 4 Explanation: Smoking is not directly associated with an increased risk of fibroadenomas, which are benign breast tumours often occurring in younger women. Smoking increases the risk of duct ectasia , Mondor disease , and breast carcinoma , but not fibroadenoma . Duct ectasia refers to the dilation or enlargement of the milk ducts in the breast, often leading to inflammation and possible discharge. It is often seen in older women, particularly during menopause. Smoking is considered a risk factor for this condition as it contributes to vascular changes and may affect the ducts. Mondor's disease is a rare condition that involves thrombophlebitis (inflammation of veins caused by blood clots) of the superficial veins in the breast or chest area. Smoking has been linked to vascular changes, which may increase the likelihood of developing Mondor’s disease. Smoking is a well-established risk factor for breast cancer, especially in postmenopausal women. Risk factors for breast cancer Modifiable risk factors Non-modifiable risk factors Obesity: BMI > 30 (RR= 1.29) Age Median age at presentation is 60 years in the West(UK, USA), While it is around 48 years in low/middle-income nations such as India. Nulliparous women or first pregnancy after 35 years Sex Female sex is a risk factor Male sex accounts for 0.5-1% of all breast cancer Breastfeeding is a protective factor Ethnicity American white, African-American Parsi in India Use of Hormonal Replacement Therapy (HRT) >10 years (RR= 1.2) Family history of breast cancer 1 first-degree relative RR= 2 2 first-degree relative RR= 3 Tobacco use (RR=1.07-1.14) Genetic predisposition BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutations account for 70% of hereditary breast cancers Alcohol Consumption (RR = 1.05-1.32) Early Menarche(<12years) Increases by around 5% for each year earlier menstruation begins RR=1.19 Radiation exposure (RR=6) Late Menopause(>55years) Increases by about 3% for each year later menopause begins RR=1.12 Age at first child <20years - Less risk >35years - High risk High-risk breast lesions Complex fibroadenoma RR=3 Papillomatosis RR=3 Ductal and lobular hyperplasia RR= 5 Lobular carcinoma in situ RR= 8-10 Reference: Bailey & Love's Short Practice of Surgery, 28th Edition, Page 922,930,931 Sabiston Textbook of Surgery, 21st Edition, Page 826",

      "question": "A 25-year-old male patient is brought to the casualty after a road traffic accident (RTA) with suspected pelvic fractures. On examination, he is found to be in hypovolemic shock. What is the earliest treatment for control of haemorrhage in this case?",

        "D": "Emergency external fixation"
      },
      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: C) Use bedsheets to compress the pelvis Explanation: In the case of pelvic fractures with suspected haemorrhage and hypovolemic shock, pelvic compression is a critical step to control bleeding and stabilise the patient. Using bedsheets (or a pelvic binder) to compress the pelvis helps reduce the volume of the pelvic cavity, which in turn minimises bleeding from the fractured vessels and improves hemodynamic stability. Management of Pelvic fractures: The primary goal in managing pelvic fractures with bleeding is to stop the bleeding, as these injuries pose a significant threat to circulation. Initial management: The first step is applying a compression binder or sheet around the true pelvis at the level of the greater trochanters to reduce pelvic volume. This life-saving procedure should be performed in the emergency department immediately. Bleeding sources: Venous Bleeding (85% of cases): Most bleeding originates from veins, which can be controlled non-operatively using pelvic compression (via binding or external fixators). Another technique is extraperitoneal pelvic packing, where the space between the bony pelvis and the peritoneum is packed to compress veins. Arterial Bleeding: If bleeding is arterial in origin, angiographic embolisation becomes the next choice for controlling haemorrhage. Techniques such as compression, packing, fixation, and angiography may be used together, as they can complement one another. If bleeding persists after packing, angiography or other interventions may be necessary. If the source of bleeding is unclear, or if diagnostic imaging (FAST/CT) shows significant blood in the peritoneal cavity, an exploratory laparotomy is warranted to rule out or address concurrent intra-abdominal injuries.",

      "correct_answer": "D",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: D) Clostridium perfringens Explanation: The soldier's shrapnel injury to his right thigh, accompanied by significant discomfort, crepitus (presence of gas in the tissues), suggests Gas Gangrene caused by Clostridium perfringens. A rapidly progressive, potentially fatal condition characterized by widespread necrosis of muscles and soft-tissue destruction, often due to late-presenting missile wounds or crushing injuries. Cause Clostridium perfringens (Option D) Incubation period <24 hours but ranges from 1 hour to 6 weeks Sources and predisposing factors Contaminated soil and feces. Wounds with necrotic or foreign material. Crush wounds, road traffic accidents, amputations. Anaerobic environments in the wound. Common sites of infection Adductor region of the lower limb and buttocks. Subscapular region in the upper limb. Clinical features Severe pain with limb swelling rapidly increases in severity. Serosanguineous discharge. Skin turns brown to blue-black with hemorrhagic bullae. Sweet, sticky odor & Soft-tissue crepitus (presence of gas in the tissues). Complication Septicaemia, toxemia, renal failure, liver failure. Circulatory failure, DIC, secondary infections. Death occurs in critically ill patients. Investigation X-ray: Gas in soft tissues. Gram stain & blood culture: Large Gram-positive bacilli without neutrophils. Biochemical profile: Metabolic acidosis, renal failure. Peripheral blood smear: Haemolysis. CT scan for chest or abdominal wounds. Treatment High-dose intravenous penicillin and clindamycin, along with 3rd generation cephalosporins, are given intravenously. Polyvalent antiserums given intravenously. All dead tissues are excised, and debridement is performed until healthy tissue bleeds. Amputation done in severe cases Hyperbaric oxygen therapy. Prevention Proper debridement of devitalized crushed wounds. Devitalized wounds should not be sutured. Adequate cleaning of wounds with H I O I and normal saline. Penicillin - As a prophylactic antibiotic. Image Clostridium septicum (Option A) causes spontaneous, non-traumatic gas gangrene and is associated with conditions like colorectal cancer or immunocompromised states, whereas Clostridium perfringens is more commonly linked to gas gangrene in traumatic injuries. Clostridioides difficile (Option B) is primarily linked to antibiotic-associated diarrhea and colitis, not gas gangrene, and does not produce the gas or tissue necrosis seen in traumatic injuries. Clostridium novyi (Option C) is a less common cause of gas gangrene, typically associated with specific conditions like soil or animal-related injuries, and is unlikely to be the cause of a shrapnel wound.",

      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: A) Copious sero-sanguinous discharge Explanation: The surest sign of Wound Dehiscence following emergency laparotomy is copious serosanguinous discharge, typically occurring around day 6 post-op, indicating a burst abdomen and requiring urgent laparotomy management. Definition Disruption of any or all of the layers in a wound. Occurrence Up to 3% of abdominal wounds; most commonly occurs between the 5th and 8th postoperative days. Types Partial dehiscence: Involves only the skin and subcutaneous fat. Complete dehiscence: Involves the fascial layer and may include evisceration (extrusion of abdominal viscera). Risk Factors General: Malnourishment Diabetes Obesity Renal failure Jaundice Sepsis Cancer Treatment with steroids Emergency surgery Local: Inadequate or poor closure of wound or closure of a wound under tension Poor local wound healing Increased intra-abdominal pressure Clinical Presentation Pinkish serosanguinous discharge (salmon-coloured fluid), (Option A) Possible evisceration, Popping sensation during straining or coughing. Treatment Partial dehiscence (without evisceration): Prompt reclosure of the fascia is generally advised. Complete dehiscence with evisceration: Requires urgent reoperation. Tension suturing is done. Protect eviscerated bowel with moist towels; handle carefully to prevent injury. Antibiotic therapy; fluid management. Rebound tenderness (Option B) refers to pain that is felt when pressure is released from the abdomen, often indicating peritoneal irritation or inflammation, typically seen in conditions like peritonitis. While rebound tenderness could suggest a complication (such as ongoing infection or intra-abdominal issues), it is not specific to wound dehiscence. Hemorrhage (Option C) : Although significant bleeding can occur after surgery, hemorrhage is not a typical feature of wound dehiscence. Hemorrhage can be caused by vessel injury, clotting issues, or inadequate hemostasis at the surgical site, but it's not directly linked to the reopening of the wound itself. Hypotension (Option D) may occur due to various factors like shock, blood loss, or infection. While hypotension can be a result of complications following surgery, it is a general sign of systemic distress rather than a specific sign of wound dehiscence. The cause of hypotension needs to be identified through further clinical investigation.",

Repeated aspirations under antibiotic cover have been unsuccessful, suggesting that the abscess is not resolving with conservative management alone. Therefore, the next best step in the management of this patient would be incision and drainage of the abscess . Incision and drainage is the most effective way to treat a breast abscess, as it allows for the complete removal of the infected material and helps to prevent recurrence. Incorrect Choices: Option b: Broad-spectrum antibiotics may be used in conjunction with incision and drainage to treat the infection, but antibiotics alone are not sufficient for the management of a breast abscess. Option c: Breast conservation surgery typically involves the removal of a breast lump or tumor. Thus, breast conservation surgery is not appropriate",

      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "III Prolonged fasting is necessary Correct Answer: A) III Prolonged fasting is necessary Explanation: ERAS protocols emphasise reducing fasting times before surgery. It allows a light meal up to six hours before surgery and clear fluids up to two hours prior. It also includes carbohydrate-rich drinks up to two hours before the procedure as it helps reduce postoperative insulin resistance, preserve muscle mass, minimize protein loss, and alleviate preoperative thirst, hunger, and anxiety. ERAS is a set of evidence-based guidelines aimed at improving recovery after surgery. It focuses on optimising preoperative, intraoperative, and postoperative care to speed up recovery, reduce complications, and shorten hospital stays. Epidural anaesthesia recommended in laparoscopic surgery for pain control (Option B) is true because it is one of the main component of ERAS and it can be used for effective pain control in many types of surgery, including laparoscopic surgery. However, its use may depend on the type of surgery and the patient’s condition. Reduction of hospital stay by 2-3 weeks (Option C) is correct as one of the key goals of ERAS is to reduce the length of hospital stay. Beta-blockers are given after major surgery done under general anaesthesia to improve outcome (Option D) is true and is mainly given to improve cardiovascular outcome.

      "correct_answer": "D",
      "explanation": "during laparoscopic surgery requires careful consideration to avoid injury to major blood vessels, including both the superior and inferior epigastric arteries . Inferior epigastric artery (IEA): Located on the posterior aspect of the rectus sheath, arising from the external iliac artery , it is at risk when inserting trocars in the lower abdominal wall. Superior epigastric artery (SEA): A continuation of the internal thoracic artery , it supplies the upper abdominal wall and is at risk in upper trocar insertions . Both arteries run within the rectus sheath , making them relevant in trocar placement at different levels of the anterior abdominal wall. Trocar Placement & Epigastric Arteries: Trocar Site At Risk Artery Precautions Umbilical (Primary) Minimal risk Insert at linea alba Supraumbilical (Upper Trocar) Superior Epigastric Artery Avoid midline rectus sheath Infraumbilical/Midclavicular Inferior Epigastric Artery Insert lateral to rectus muscle Palmar’s Point (LUQ Trocar) Minimal risk Used in difficult access cases Superior Epigastric Artery (Option A): Incorrect alone because it is only at risk in upper abdominal trocar placement . Inferior Epigastric Artery (Option B): Incorrect alone because both superior and inferior epigastric arteries are at risk depending on trocar position . Abdominal Aorta (Option C): Incorrect because the aorta is a deep retroperitoneal structure, not directly relevant to trocar insertion .

      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: B)6 Explanation: The Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) is a tool used to assess a patient’s level of consciousness based on three parameters: eye-opening , verbal response , and motor response . Each parameter is scored, and the total GCS score ranges from 3 (deep coma) to 15 (fully awake). Eye response : The patient's eyes do not open, even in response to pain, corresponding to a score of 1 . Verbal response : The patient makes incomprehensible sounds, corresponding to a score of 2 . Motor response : The patient exhibits abnormal flexion (decorticate posturing) in response to pain, corresponding to a score of 3 . Thus, the GCS score for this patient is: 1 (Eye) + 2 (Verbal) + 3 (Motor) = 6 Simplified Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) Table Category Response Score Eye Opening (E) Spontaneous 4 To speech 3 To pain 2 None 1 Verbal Response (V) Oriented 5 Confused conversation 4 Inappropriate words 3 Incomprehensible sounds 2 None 1 Motor Response (M) Obeys commands 6 Localizes to pain 5 Withdraws from pain 4 Abnormal flexion (decorticate) 3 Abnormal extension (decerebrate) 2 No response 1 Head Injury Severity: Clinical Classification Minor head injury GCS 15 with no LOC (loss of consciousness) Mild head injury GCS 14 or 15 with LOC Moderate head injury GCS 9 - 13 Severe head injury GCS 3 - 8 The GCS-P score is calculated by subtracting the Pupil Reactivity Score (PRS) from the Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) total score: GCS-P = GCS - PRS.

      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: B) Secure airway, give oxygen, insert ICD, secure IV line Explanation: The patient has GCS 8/15 , indicating a severe head injury and possible impaired consciousness . Therefore, securing the airway is the priority to prevent further deterioration. Oxygen should be administered to address the low oxygen saturation (85%). The absence of breath sounds on the right side raises concern for tension pneumothorax or large pneumothorax , which can lead to respiratory failure . In this case, the next step is to insert an intercostal chest drain (ICD) to relieve any pneumothorax and re-expand the lung. IV access should be secured for fluid resuscitation or medication administration, but airway and breathing take precedence. We will follow a primary survey of A, B, C, D, and E to manage this patient, where A is securing the airway, B is giving oxygen and inserting ICD, and C includes IV line. Start IV fluids, give atropine and secure airway (Option A) : Securing the airway is important, but giving atropine is not the priority here because the patient has a heart rate of 60 bpm , which is not significantly low and does not require atropine at this stage. Evaluate for head injury and do CT-head (Option C) : The immediate concern is the airway and respiratory distress . The absence of breath sounds on the right side suggests a life-threatening thoracic injury that should be managed first, with a CT scan of the head being considered later once the patient is stabilised. Administer IV dextrose followed by NCCT head (Option D) : There is no indication that the patient is hypoglycemic or in need of IV dextrose at this moment. The priority should be stabilising the airway and managing the potential pneumothorax . The NCCT head can be done later if head injury is suspected after stabilizing the patient.

However, in the acute setting of severe hematemesis, it is inappropriate as the immediate next step. The patient needs urgent stabilization, not an invasive diagnostic procedure. Option D - Perform an endoscopy to look for varices: Endoscopy is essential for diagnosing and managing variceal bleeding, particularly in a patient with portal hypertension secondary to chronic alcohol use.

      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: B) High vascular resistance Explanation: In Hypovolemic shock, as the body tries to compensate for the reduced blood volume, the blood vessels constrict (vasoconstriction) to preserve blood pressure and redirect blood flow to vital organs like the heart and brain. This results in increased vascular resistance. Decreased cardiac output (Option A) : Since there's less blood to pump, the heart cannot maintain a normal cardiac output. This is opposite to what happens in some other types of shock (e.g., septic shock), where cardiac output may initially increase. Decreased venous pressure (Option C) : Lower blood volume means less blood returning to the heart, leading to reduced venous pressure. Decreased mixed venous saturation (Option D) : In hypovolemic shock, oxygen delivery is impaired, and the blood returning to the heart has a lower oxygen saturation, which is reflected in a lower mixed venous oxygen saturation.

Fibroadenoma: It is the most common benign breast tumour, typically found in women aged 15-35. Characteristics: Spherical masses measuring 1-10 cm, firm, non-tender, well-circumscribed, mobile and often single . The lump is mobile and slippery and hence called breast mouse. Estrogen sensitivity: Can increase in size during pregnancy, lactation, or estrogen therapy and usually regress after menopause. HPE: Well-defined borders due to a fibrous capsule , with proliferating stroma potentially compressing and distorting glandular components. Popcorn calcification on mammogram. Ageing effect: Epithelium atrophies with age, and the stroma becomes more hyalinised.

If the patient requests excision, and if there are no concerns about malignancy, excision can be performed to remove the lipoma for cosmetic or symptomatic reasons. Lipoma: A lipoma is a benign tumour composed of mature adipocytes (fat cells) and is the most common soft tissue tumor. These tumors are generally soft, mobile, and painless masses found beneath the skin. Most frequently found on the trunk, shoulders, neck, and arms. Histologically, lipomas consist of mature fat cells that are identical to normal adipose tissue but are",

      "question": "A 47-year-old man presents with a chronic non-healing painless ulcer over his scalp for 8 years. He has a history of electric burns to the scalp 8 years ago. The examination findings are shown below. Which of the following statements is true?",
      "options": {
        "A": "Radiotherapy is useful",
        "B": "It can progress to squamous cell carcinoma",
        "C": "No lymphatic spread",
        "D": "Long-duration antibiotics will improve the condition."
      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: B) It can progress to squamous cell carcinoma Explanation: Chronic non-healing ulcers , especially those resulting from burn injuries or other trauma, are at high risk of malignant transformation , most commonly to squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) . This is known as Marjolin's ulcer , which can develop in areas of chronic injury or scar tissue. Marjolin’s Ulcer Definition Low-grade Squamous Cell Carcinoma (SCC) Common Sites of Development Post-burn scar Long-standing venous ulcer Chronic ulcer due to trauma Chronic discharging osteomyelitis sinus Post-radiation ulcer Pathophysiology Develops in scar tissue due to chronic irritation Characteristic Features Painless (no nerves in scar tissues) Slow growing No regional LN metastasis (no lymphatics in scar tissue) Investigation of Choice Biopsy Management Wide local excision followed by a flap cover Radiotherapy should be avoided (Option A) (as it is radio-resistant and also to prevent obliterative end arteritis) Malignant lesions like squamous cell carcinoma can spread via lymphatic channels (Option C) ,",

      "question": "A 25-year-old woman presents with severe pain and swelling in her right hand, which is increasing in size and severity. She had a prick injury in the garden 5 days ago. On examination, she cries out in pain when her hand is extended and when the palmar aspect is palpated passively. Which of the following statements is true about the condition?",
      "options": {
        "A": "More common in the dorsal aspect of the hand",
        "B": "X-ray imaging will aid in the location of the foreign body in all patients",
        "C": "It requires incision and drainage",
        "D": "Oral analgesics are the mainstay of treatment"
      },
      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: C) It requires incision and drainage Explanation: The patient likely has a deep palmar abscess secondary to a foreign body, and incision and drainage (I&D) is required to relieve pressure, remove the foreign body, and treat the infection. Deep Palmar Infection: These infections begin in the palm and may be confined to a web space initially. As the infection progresses, the entire hand becomes swollen and tender due to the accumulation of pus on either side of the septum. Management: The treatment involves incision and drainage (I&D) with a thorough washout of the wound. It's essential to open all affected deep spaces. In some cases, incisions may be needed on both the dorsal and volar sides of the hand. If the extent of the infection is unclear, imaging techniques like ultrasound or MRI can be used to delineate the spread within the deep palmar spaces. Incorrect Options: More common in the dorsal aspect of the hand (Option A) : Infections or abscesses caused by foreign bodies are more common in the palmar aspect due to the tighter fascial compartments. X-ray imaging will aid in the location of the foreign body in all patients (Option B) : X-rays are not always helpful, especially for non-radio-opaque foreign bodies (wood), so other imaging like ultrasound might be more useful. Oral analgesics (Option D) may help manage pain, but they are not sufficient for treating the underlying",

      "question": "A patient fell from a train onto the railway track and injured both his legs severely. He was urgently taken to the hospital, and the following procedure was performed (image shown below). What is the rationale for performing this procedure?",

        "A": "Better fit for prosthesis",
        "B": "Life-saving procedure",
        "C": "Reduces risk of cancer",
        "D": "Good cosmetic outcomes"
      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: B) Life-saving procedure Explanation: In cases of severe trauma , such as being run over or falling on railway tracks, injuries can be so extensive that amputation is necessary to prevent massive blood loss , gangrene , or infection , which can lead to death. The decision for a bilateral below-knee amputation is usually made as a life-saving measure when there is irreversible damage to the legs. Indications for Amputation: Dead Limb: Gangrene Deadly Limb Wet gangrene Spreading cellulitis Arteriovenous fistula Malignancy (e.g., sarcoma) Dead loss of limb: Severe rest pain due to irreversible critical leg ischemia Paralysis Severe contracture Trauma (irreparable damage) Local Amputation : For small-vessel disease (e.g., diabetes) : Gangrene of toes may require local amputation. If the metatarsophalangeal joint is involved, ray excision may be necessary. Major Amputation: Below-knee Amputation : Preserves knee joint, offering better prosthetic use. Above-knee Amputation : For poor circulation or non-mobilizing patients. Knee Disarticulation : Preserves femur and patella for better prosthetic function. Post-operative care: Pain Management : Regular opiate use. Limb Care : Prevent pressure ulcers on the remaining limb. Exercise : Prevent deformities, build strength, and improve mobility. Complications: Early : Hemorrhage, infection, gas gangrene, and wound dehiscence. Late : Phantom limb pain, stump ulceration, DVT, and pulmonary embolism Reference: Bailey & Love's Short Practice of Surgery, 28th Edition, Page 1014,1015",

        "A": "Lungs",
        "B": "Intestine",
        "C": "Kidney",
        "D": "Liver"
      },
      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: A) Lungs Explanation: Survival after lung transplantation continues to improve over time; however, the rates remain lower compared to other solid organ transplants. Around 50% of lung transplant recipients will face at least one episode of acute rejection within the first year . Furthermore, by five years post-transplant , roughly half of recipients will have developed chronic rejection . Incorrect Options: Kidney transplantation: (Option C) Graft rejection rate for kidney transplants is quite low after the first year. Specifically, with living-donor kidneys , the 1-year survival rate is 98% , and with deceased-donor kidneys , the 1-year survival rate is 93% . At 5 years, the graft survival rate for living-donor kidneys is 85%, and for deceased-donor kidneys, it is 75% . By 10 years, the survival rates drop to 65% for living-donor kidneys and 48% for deceased-donor kidneys, indicating a gradual decline due to chronic processes rather than acute rejection episodes. Liver transplantation (Option D): Chronic rejection occurs in about 13-17% of recipients Intestinal transplantation (Option B): Chronic rejection occurs in about 10% of recipients.
