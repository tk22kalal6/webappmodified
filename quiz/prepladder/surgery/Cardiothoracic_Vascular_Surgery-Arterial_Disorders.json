He has a history of 2 episodes of strokes, after which he has left-sided sensory and motor loss limited to the face and neck. Which of the following blood vessels might be stenosed in this case?",
      "options": {
        "A": "Left vertebral artery",
        "B": "Carotid artery",
        "C": "First part of the left subclavian artery",
        "D": "Superior mesenteric vein"
      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: B) Carotid artery Explanation: The condition is diagnosed as Carotid artery stenosis , having clinical features of face and neck paralysis along with Amaurosis fugax (loss of vision in the form of a curtain coming down in front of the eye). Carotid artery stenosis Carotid artery stenosis may cause TIAs (Transient Ischemic Attacks), which are short-lived mini strokes and are often recurrent, causing unilateral motor or sensory loss in the arm, leg or face. They are caused by the distal embolisation of platelet thrombi that form on the atheromatous plaque and enter the cerebral circulation. They are considered as a warning of impending major stroke. Duplex scan is done for assessment. Indications for Endarterectomy: Stenosis of more than or equal to 50% Ipsilateral amaurosis fugax or monocular blindness Contralateral facial paralysis or paresthesia Arm/leg paresthesia Hemianopia Dysphasia Sensory loss or visual inattention or neglect. Amaurosis fugax is the temporary loss of vision due decreased blood supply to the retina to blockage of arteries. It is presented as a feeling of a curtain coming down in front of the eyes. Left vertebral artery (Option A): Stenosis can cause symptoms such as vertigo, numbness in hands and feet, drop attacks, nausea, vomiting, slurred speech, ataxia, abnormal gait, loss of vision, and double vision. This condition is known as vertebrobasilar insufficiency (VBI). 1st part of left subclavian artery (Option C): In subclavian artery stenosis, there is this characteristic “Subclavian steal syndrome” which us due to reversal of blood from ipsilateral vertebral artery leading to weakness, syncope, vertigo, dizziness, ataxia, visual abnormalities. Superior mesenteric vein (Option D): Occlusion can lead to mesenteric venous thrombosis (MVT). Abdominal pain is the main complaint in this case along with hematochezia or melena if not treated early. Reference: Bailey & Love’s Short Practice of Surgery, 28th Edition, Page 1008",

      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: C) TEE (TransEsophageal Echocardiography) Explanation: The above given scenario is an unstable case of Aortic dissection, and the investigation of choice is TEE (TransEsophageal Echocardiography). Aortic Dissection It occurs when a defect or a flap occurs in the aorta, resulting in blood tracking into aortic tissues, splitting the medial layer, and creating a false lumen. Clinical features: Sudden onset of severe, tearing chest pain radiating to the interscapular region Renal pain and renal failure Paraplegia Syncope Weakness Hypotension or shock Investigations: If the patient is stable, CT angiography is the standard investigation of choice. (Option A) In the case of unstable patients (SBP<100 mm of HG, HR>100 bpm), the preferred investigation of choice will be TEE (TransEsophageal Echocardiography) MRI can also be done if CT is unequivocal. Chest x-ray (Option D) reveals widening of the mediastinum along with left-sided pleural effusion. TEE of an aortic dissection within the descending part Aortography (Option B) is the investigation of choice for chronic mesenteric ischemia.",

      },
      "correct_answer": "D",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: D) Nicoladoni’s sign Explanation: Nicoladoni’s sign/ Branham sign is seen in arteriovenous fistula. Arteriovenous Fistula (AVF) AVF is a communication between an artery and a vein that may be either congenital or acquired (trauma or surgical). Structurally, they are arterialised (become dilated, tortuous and thick-walled). Physiologically, there is an increase in venous return (as blood starts flowing from arteries to veins, which causes an increase in cardiac output, which in turn results in an increase in systolic BP, leading to cardiac failure. On examination, there is a presence of pulsatile swelling, a thrill and auscultation reveals machinery murmur (buzzing continuous murmur) Nicoladoni’s / Branham’s sign is observed in AVF: On pressing the artery proximal to the fistula, there is a decrease in the size of the pulsatile mass, disappearance of palpable thrill and decrease in heart rate. Murphy’s sign (Option A): Pain during inspiration while palpating the right subcostal area is termed Murphy’s sign. It is seen in acute cholecystitis. Brudzinski’s sign (Option B): In meningitis, neck stiffness causes patient's hips and knees to flex when the neck is flexed; this is Brudzinski’s sign. Hegar’s sign (Option C): Softening of the cervix in pregnancy is known as hegar’s sign Reference: Bailey & Love’s Short Practice of Surgery, 28th Edition, Page 1023, 1024",

      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: B) Roos Test Explanation: The scenario describes the Roos test (also known as the Elevated Arm Stress Test), which is used to diagnose thoracic outlet syndrome (TOS). The test involves the patient abducting their arms to 90°, externally rotating them, flexing the elbows to 90°, and repeatedly opening and closing the hands for 3 minutes. Reproduction of symptoms like numbness or tingling during this test indicates a positive result, suggestive of TOS. Roos Test Common provocative diagnostic tests for Thoracic Outlet Syndrome (TOS): Test Maneuver Result Adson's Test (Option A) Arm abducted 30° and maximally extended. Patient extends neck, turns head toward the ipsilateral side, and inhales deeply. Decrease or absence of ipsilateral radial pulse.

        "D": "Axillary nerve (C5-C6)"
      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: B) Ulnar nerve (C8-T1) Explanation: The most likely diagnosis is thoracic outlet syndrome (TOS), where the ulnar nerve (C8-T1) is commonly compressed and presents with muscle wasting in the hand and sensory loss in the medial hand and forearm. TOS often presents in athletes like swimmers, who frequently use overhead movements. The ulnar nerve is vulnerable in TOS because it passes through the thoracic outlet and can be compressed by anatomical structures such as a cervical rib or tight scalene muscles. Thoracic outlet syndrome: Category Details Boundaries Upper: Collarbone (Clavicle) Lower: First Rib Anterior: Scalenus Anterior Muscle Posterior: Scalenus Medius Muscle Medial: Scalene Triangle (formed by the Scalenus Anterior, Scalenus Medius, and First Rib) Predisposing Factors Cervical Rib, Cervical Hematoma (Trauma), Pancoast Tumor, Osteoarthritis, Long Transverse Process of C7 Clinical Manifestations Neurogenic TOS: Pain, numbness, and tingling due to nerve compression Arterial TOS: Pain, coldness, and paleness due to impaired arterial blood flow Venous TOS: Swelling, pain, and discolouration due to impaired venous return Median nerve (C5-T1) (Option A) typically causes symptoms like carpal tunnel syndrome, affecting the thumb, index, and middle fingers, which are not described here. Radial nerve (C5-T1) (Option C) compression would lead to weakness in wrist and finger extension, commonly known as \"wrist drop.\" Axillary nerve(C5-C6) (Option D) involvement leads to deltoid muscle weakness and loss of sensation over the lateral shoulder, which is not observed in this case.

      "explanation": "Correct Answer: C) Endovascular aneurysm repair Explanation: Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm : For an abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) that has reached 6.0 cm in diameter, surgical intervention is generally recommended due to the high risk of rupture. Endovascular aneurysm repair (EVAR) is a minimally invasive surgical approach that is often preferred for eligible patients, given its lower complication rates compared to open surgery. Surveillance is appropriate for smaller aneurysms, and medical management, including blood pressure control and lifestyle modifications, is essential but not sufficient alone for an aneurysm of this size. Management of Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm (AAA): Aspect Details Surveillance Small AAAs (3.0–3.9 cm): Monitor every 2–3 years using ultrasound. Medium AAAs (4.0–5.4 cm): Monitor every 6–12 months with ultrasound. Large AAAs ( ≥ 5.5 cm): Surgical intervention recommended; if not, frequent imaging and clinical review. Medical Management Risk Factor Modification : Smoking Cessation Blood Pressure Control Cholesterol Management: Statins recommended. Surgical Intervention I ndications for Surgery: Aneurysm Diameter ≥ 5.5 cm (High risk of rupture) Rapid Growth: >0.5 cm increase in six months. Symptomatic AAAs : Consider surgery. Surgical Options : Open Surgical Repair: Using a Dacron graft which is durable and has higher morbidity. Endovascular Aneurysm Repair (EVAR): Less invasive, requires long-term surveillance for complications. Reference: Sabiston’s Textbook of Surgery, 21 Edition, Pages 1747-1751",

      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "→ Cyanosis → Rubor Correct Answer: C) Pallor → Cyanosis → Rubor Explanation: Sequence of events in Raynaud’s phenomenon: Pallor : The initial phase where the skin becomes pale or white due to reduced blood flow and vasospasm. Cyanosis : Followed by a blue or purple colour due to continued reduced blood flow and lack of oxygen. Rubor : The final phase is where the skin turns red as blood flow returns and the area warms up. Category Description Definition Raynaud phenomenon is characterized by episodic reduction in blood flow, typically in the fingers, triggered by cold exposure or stress. Clinical Features Pallor: Skin becomes pale or white due to reduced blood flow. Cyanosis: Skin turns blue or purple due to deoxygenation of blood. Rubor: Skin turns red as blood flow returns, often with swelling and tingling. Cold Sensitivity: Cold, numb fingers. Pain: Pain during the cyanotic phase. Swelling and Tingling: Occurs in the rubor phase. Types Primary Raynaud Phenomenon (Raynaud Disease): Occurs without underlying disease. More common and has a better prognosis. Secondary Raynaud Phenomenon (Raynaud Syndrome): Occurs due to an underlying condition (e.g., scleroderma, lupus). Often more severe. Management Lifestyle Modifications: Avoid cold exposure, stress reduction, and smoking cessation.

      "question": "A 58-year-old male presents to the emergency department with a sudden onset of severe pain in his left leg. The leg appears pale and feels cold to the touch, and the patient is unable to move or feel his toes. On examination, no pulses are detectable below the knee. What is the most likely diagnosis?",

        "D": "Cellulitis"
      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: B) Acute limb ischemia Explanation: This patient’s symptoms strongly suggest Acute limb ischemia , a serious condition caused by a sudden blockage of blood flow to the limb. It is typically recognised by the \"5 P's\": Pain : Intense, sudden pain in the affected limb. Pallor: The limb appears pale due to reduced blood flow. Pulselessness: The absence of a pulse beyond the site of the blockage. Paresthesia: Numbness or tingling in the limb. Paralysis: The inability to move the limb due to muscle weakness. Prompt recognition and treatment are essential to restore blood flow and prevent permanent damage to the limb. Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT) (Option A): DVT typically presents with swelling, pain, and redness in the affected leg, but it does not usually cause the leg to be pale and cold or result in a loss of pulses. The loss of pulses and coldness are more indicative of arterial rather than venous issues. Chronic Venous Insufficiency (Option C): Chronic venous insufficiency generally causes symptoms such as swelling, varicose veins, and skin changes over time. It does not typically present with sudden onset severe pain, pallor, coldness, or loss of pulses. Cellulitis (Option D): Cellulitis usually presents with redness, warmth, swelling, and tenderness of the skin. It typically does not cause loss of pulses, coldness, or the inability to move or feel the toes, which are more consistent with ischemic conditions rather than infection.

      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: A) Cimino-Brescia fistula Explanation: The Cimino-Brescia fistula is the most commonly used AV fistula for hemodialysis access. It involves connecting the radial artery to the cephalic vein at the wrist, creating a durable and reliable access point for hemodialysis. Surgically created Arterio-Venous fistula : It is a connection made between an artery and a vein, typically in the arm, and is most commonly used for patients with end-stage renal disease who require hemodialysis. Aspect Details Purpose Used for hemodialysis Provides high blood flow for effective dialysis Site Selection Prefer distal placement Non-dominant arm is typically used Arterial Quality Requires a strong arterial pulse for success Vein Preservation Avoid placing venous lines in the arm intended for fistula Examples of Surgically created fistulas are: Brescia-Cimino fistula: It is created between the Radial artery and the Cephalic vein. Snuff Box fistula: It is created between the Posterior branch of the radial artery and Cephalic vein (Option C) Feinberg fistula: It is created between the Radial artery and the Basilic vein. Blalock-Taussig shunt Option B): It is a surgically created AV shunt used primarily to increase pulmonary blood flow in patients with congenital heart defects like tricuspid atresia, tetralogy of Fallot etc. It is not used for hemodialysis. Axillary-axillary loop graft (Option D): This loop graft is typically used when the more common sites for AV fistulas are not viable. It is less common than the Cimino-Brescia fistula for hemodialysis.",

      },
      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: C) Arterial ulcer Explanation: The most probable diagnosis of the given ulcer is Arterial ulcer. It occurs due to severe arterial insufficiency of digital and medium sized arteries leading to ischemia and tissue death in the region. They may present as painful erosions, located between the toes, dorsum of feet, on the shin and around malleoli. Characteristic features of arterial ulcers: Punched-out edges are seen It is intensely painful Distal pulses are not palpable Thin, shiny skin is seen Loss of hair in the area Brittle nails are seen Clinical features of different ulcers are as follows: Venous ulcer (Option B) Arterial ulcer (Option C) Neuropathic ulcer (Option A) Pressure ulcer (Option D) Site Gaiter’s area (area between malleolus and calf) At distal ends of limbs, such as toes, feet and legs. Over toe joints, under the heel, over malleoli, under the metatarsal head, etc Seen over pressure points, most common are ischium, greater trochanter, sacrum, hee, malleolus, occiput, etc Appearance Vertically oval with a sloping edge and will not penetrate deep fascia. Punched-out edges are seen in this type of ulcer. Ulcers can be associated with gangrene and abscesses; osteomyelitis can be seen here. Punched out ulcer with bone as a base. Cause Caused by ambulatory chronic venous hypertension due to varicose veins. This occurs due to severe arterial insufficiency of digital and medium-sized arteries, leading to ischemia and tissue death in the region. It is caused due to repeated trauma and ischemia due to microangiopathy in diabetic patients . It is tissue necrosis and ulceration due to prolonged pressure on any part of the body. Characteristics It is initially painful, then chronically becomes painless. It heals on rest and treatment but reforms again. It is intensely painful, distal pulses are not palpable, associated with shiny skin, brittle nails and loss of hair over the region. Also known as diabetic ulcer since it is seen in diabetic patients. It is common in bedridden patients with head injuries,",

      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: B) Intermittent claudication. Explanation: ABPI is measured supine by checking the systolic blood pressure in both upper and lower limbs (brachial, posterior tibial, and dorsalis pedis arteries). The higher value from each limb is used to calculate the ABPI. ABPI (Ankle brachial pressure index) or ABI (Ankle brachial index) here is 0.7 which indicates intermittent claudication in Buerger's disease. This index is calculated as: ABI / ABPI = Systolic BP in the Ankle/ Systolic BP in the arm Interpretations are as follows: Value Interpretation 0.1 - 0.4 Critical limb ischemia (Option A) 0.5 - 0.9 Intermittent claudication (Option B) 1.0 - 1.2 Normal (Option C) > 1.2 Calcified vessels (seen in patients with DM, End stage renal disease) (Option D) Reference: Sabiston’s Textbook of Surgery, 21st Edition, Page 1773",

Calcification detection: Accurate detection and quantification of arterial calcification. Less invasive: Less invasive than conventional angiography while maintaining detailed imaging. Characteristic radiological findings in peripheral arterial disease include: Disease confinement to distal circulation. Segmental occlusions with \"skip\" lesions. Extensive collateralization, notably \"corkscrew\" collaterals . Ankle-Brachial Index (Option A): It is a good screening tool but lacks specificity for detailed arterial mapping.

      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: B) Thromboangiitis obliterans Explanation: The patient's age, heavy smoking history, and angiographic findings with \"corkscrew\" collaterals strongly indicate Buerger's Disease (Thromboangiitis obliterans). This condition involves inflammatory thrombosis affecting small and medium-sized vessels, primarily in the extremities. It presents with pain, ulcers, and claudication in both upper and lower limbs, often leading to gangrene if untreated.

      },
      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: A) Atherosclerosis Explanation: Atherosclerosis is the most likely cause due to the patient's advanced age and sudden onset of symptoms consistent with acute arterial occlusion. This condition typically affects individuals over 50 years and is associated with risk factors such as smoking, hypertension, diabetes, and hyperlipidemia. Atherosclerosis involves lipid accumulation, inflammation, and plaque formation in large and medium-sized arteries, leading to a gradual but progressive narrowing that can result in sudden occlusion. Causes of peripheral arterial occlusion: Atherosclerosis (Most common) Embolism Thrombosis Trauma Vasculitis (e.g., Buerger’s disease) Fibromuscular dysplasia Arterial dissection Extrinsic compression Vessels involved and common sites of obstruction: Vessel Common Sites of Obstruction Related Manifestations/Findings Aorta Infrarenal aorta Bilateral lower limb ischemia, absent femoral pulses Iliac arteries Common iliac bifurcation Unilateral lower limb ischemia, absent femoral pulse Pain in the buttock is due to a block in the common iliac or aortoiliac segment (30%), often associated with impotence and is called as Leriche's syndrome. Femoral artery Common femoral artery Calf claudication, absent popliteal and distal pulses Popliteal artery Adductor canal Calf and foot ischemia, absent pedal pulses Tibial arteries Proximal or mid-calf Foot ischemia, absent pedal pulses Subclavian artery Proximal subclavian Arm ischemia, absent radial/ulnar pulses Subclavian steal syndrome: Obstruction of the first part of the subclavian artery can cause reverse blood flow through the vertebral artery, providing collateral circulation to the arm but affecting the posterior brain and upper limb, with steal being occult, partial, or complete. Brachial artery Mid-humerus level Forearm and hand ischemia, absent radial/ulnar pulses Buerger's disease (Option B): Unlikely due to the patient's age (72 years). It typically affects young adults under 45 , particularly heavy smokers. Fibromuscular dysplasia (Option C): Rare, non-inflammatory arterial disease, usually affecting women aged 30-50 . Commonly involves renal and carotid arteries. Arterial dissection (Option D): Less common in elderly patients. Usually, it occurs in larger arteries (aorta, major branches). The absence of severe, tearing back pain makes this less likely.
