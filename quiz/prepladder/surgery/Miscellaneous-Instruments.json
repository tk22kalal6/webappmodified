      "question": "A 45 year old woman undergoes surgery for varicose veins involving the stripping of the long saphenous vein using a Mayo vein stripper. Post-operatively, she complains of pain and tingling along the medial aspect of her leg. Which nerve is most commonly damaged during the stripping of the long saphenous vein?",

        "A": "Sciatic nerve",
        "B": "Tibial nerve",
        "C": "Saphenous nerve",
        "D": "Femoral nerve"
      },
      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: C) Saphenous nerve Explanation: The saphenous nerve runs along the path of the long saphenous vein and is susceptible to injury during stripping procedures, leading to saphenous neuralgia. MAYO VEIN STRIPPER: Mayo Vein Stripper Uses: Primarily used for removal of varicose veins, typically the long saphenous vein. Employed when the vein is severely damaged, often due to varicose veins. Procedure: Insertion: The Mayo vein stripper is passed through an incision made just below the saphenofemoral junction. Stripping : The instrument is threaded through the vein, usually stripping up to the middle of the leg. Ligation : The damaged vein is tied off (ligated) or completely removed, depending on the condition of the vein. Complications: Saphenous neuralgia (nerve pain). Saphenous nerve injury is the most common complication after surgical treatment of varicose veins. Endothermal ablation The endothermal ablation procedure involves threading a small laser fibre into the vein at the failure location. Following local anesthesia, blood flow is obstructed by irritating the vein wall and allowing the vein to close. The vein eventually disappears and is no longer visible on the surface of the leg. There are two types of endothermal ablation: endovenous laser ablation (EVLA) and radiofrequency ablation (RFA) Sciatic nerve (Option A) : Unlikely to be damaged as it runs posteriorly in the thigh, far from the saphenous vein. Tibial nerve (Option B) : Unlikely to be affected since it is located in the posterior compartment of the leg, not near the saphenous vein. Femoral nerve (Option D) : Unlikely to be damaged during this procedure as it is located in the groin and anterior thigh, away from the path of the saphenous vein.",

      "explanation": "Correct Answer: B) Explanation: This instrument is known as a scapula retractor. It has got a long stout handle with a broad right-angled blade with serrations. It is used to retract scapula during thoracotomy Balfour self-retaining retractor (Option A ruled out): Features adjustable blades for retracting the abdominal wall and tissues during surgery. Quadrangular metal frame with two heavy, hook-shaped side blades designed to fit into the wound sides. Includes a detachable third blade for retracting viscera. One side blade has a screw to adjust the retraction width, while the detachable blade is fixed through an adjustable screw with a slot. Inserted closed into the wound, then widened as needed Beckman Weitlaner retractor (Option D ruled out): The Beckman Weitlaner Retractor is a surgical tool that retracts tissues and skin during surgical procedures. It is most commonly used during spinal and hip surgeries. The instrument features finger ring handles along with a self-locking mechanism Scapula retractor (Option B): It has got a long stout handle with a broad right-angled blade with serrations. It is used to retract the scapula during thoracotomy. Allison Lung retractor (Option C ruled out): Long handle with light blade. The blade is made up of wires.

      "explanation": "Correct Answer: B) Potts bulldog clamp Explanation: Doyen’s intestinal occlusion clamp (Option C ruled out): Have diagonal serrations with opposing blades Used to grasp and enclose delicate structures such as the intestines. These instruments are used to occlude the lumen of the intestine and the blood vessels The instrument has slightly concave jaws; therefore both ends meet only at the extreme when locked. The lumen of the intestine or vessels lies in the center of concavity ensuring sustained pressure which is just enough to occlude the lumen but not damage it. Payr’s gastric occlusion clamp (Option A ruled out): It has longitudinal serrations on the inner surface of the blades with several ball-like projections along the sides which interlock each other of the opposite blade to have a firm grip on the stomach/bowel while using. Once applied, it crushes the bowel. Light’s Bulldog clamp (Option D ruled out): Operates with a pinch cock mechanism to open and close. Features fine transverse serrations on the blades.

      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: B) Bipolar diathermy is preferred in patients with implants. Explanation: Bipolar diathermy is preferred in sensitive areas and for patients with implanted devices because it limits the current flow to the tissue between the two active electrodes, thus reducing the risk of unintended burns and ensuring a more controlled application. Monopolar Diathermy Mechanism: Electrical current flows from a single electrode (diathermy pencil) through the target tissue and returns via a large surface plate (indifferent electrode). Applications: Used for cutting and coagulation in various surgeries. Hazards Inadequate Contact : Poor contact with the indifferent electrode can cause burns. Accidental Earthing: Touching metal objects can create unintended current pathways, leading to burns. Insulation Failure: Damaged insulation on leads can cause burns. Accidental Activation: Unintentional activation or contact with metal instruments can result in burns. Bipolar Diathermy: Mechanism: Uses two active electrodes (forceps, scissors) with current flowing between them, heating only the tissue between the tips. No indifferent electrode is needed. Applications: Ideal for operating near vital structures and for patients with implanted devices. (Option C ruled out) Advantages: Enhanced safety by localizing current and reducing the risk of unintended burns. Key Considerations for Safe Electrosurgery Equipment Check: Verify settings before use. Lowest Effective Setting : Use minimal current necessary. (Option A ruled out) Caution with Metal Objects : Be careful near other metal instruments. Intermittent Use : Apply in short, controlled bursts. Bipolar Preference: Prefer bipolar in sensitive areas or for patients with implants. (Option B) Smoke Evacuation: Use smoke extractors to reduce exposure to surgical smoke. (Option D ruled out)",

      "explanation": "Correct Answer: C) Sealing time is 8-10 seconds. Explanation: The given image is that of Ligasure. The sealing time is 2 to 4 seconds per seal. LigaSure: Technology: Uses pressure and continuous bipolar energy for vessel sealing. (Option A ruled out) Available for both laparoscopic and open surgeries since 1998. Mechanism: Applies high mechanical compression and adjusts energy delivery. Denatures collagen and elastin in vessel walls, forming a solid tissue seal upon cooling. (Option D ruled out) Efficiency: Sealing time: Quick - 2 to 4 seconds per seal. (Option C) Achieves burst pressures over three times the normal systolic blood pressure. (Option B ruled out) Enhances reliability and consistency in surgical procedures. Advantages: Reduced Blood Loss: Significantly decreases operative blood loss and procedure time compared to traditional sutures and clips. Enhanced Safety: Features feedback-controlled technology that stops energy delivery when the seal is complete, minimizing risk to surrounding tissues. Applications: Surgical Use: Effective in surgeries involving vascular pedicles (e.g., myomectomy, hysterectomy) and hemorrhoidectomy, thyroidectomies & open GI surgeries,",
