      "explanation": "Correct Answer: B) Shunt obstruction Explanation: Shunt obstruction is the most common cause of VP shunt malfunction. This can occur anywhere along the length of the shunt, but it often happens at the distal catheter (the part of the shunt that drains into the peritoneum). A Ventriculoperitoneal (VP) shunt is generally considered for long-term management of hydrocephalus . It is implanted surgically to divert excess cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) from the ventricles of the brain to the peritoneal cavity , where it can be absorbed by the body. Management of Hydrocephalus: Medical : Acetazolamide and furosemide can temporarily reduce CSF production",

        "D": "Tuberous sclerosis"
      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: B) Von Hippel-Lindau disease Explanation: The most likely diagnosis is Von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) disease , a hereditary condition characterised by the development of multiple cysts in the kidneys, pancreas, and other organs. VHL is an autosomal dominant disorder due to VHL gene mutation on chromosome 3. Patients often have an increased risk of developing pheochromocytomas, which can cause symptoms like headaches, palpitations, and sweating. The elevated urinary metanephrines further support this diagnosis, as they are markers for pheochromocytomas. It is also associated with the development of various tumours like Hemangioblastomas in the CNS (cerebellum and retina) Cysts of the pancreas, liver, and kidneys Renal cell carcinomas Multiple endocrine neoplasia type I (Option A) is a genetic condition characterised by the development of tumours in multiple endocrine glands, and it typically features hyperparathyroidism, pituitary adenomas, and pancreatic tumours, rather than the renal and pancreatic cysts as seen in VHL. Birt-Hogg-Dube syndrome (Option C) is a rare autosomal dominant disorder clinically manifested by fibrofolliculomas, renal cell carcinoma, lung cysts, and spontaneous pneumothorax. It is caused by mutations in the FLCN gene. Though they develop renal tumours, they do not commonly cause pancreatic cysts , pheochromocytomas , or elevated metanephrines . Tuberous sclerosis (Option D), also called Tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC), is an autosomal dominant condition caused by mutations in either the TSC1 or TSC2 gene. It causes benign tumours in various organs, including the brain, kidneys, heart, and skin. It also leads to skin lesions like ash-leaf spots, shagreen patches, and facial angiofibroma. However, pancreatic cysts and pheochromocytomas are not typically associated with tuberous sclerosis. Reference: Robbins and Cotranâ€™s Pathologic Basis of Disease, 10th Edition, Pages 809, 1032",

      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: C) Neural tumour Explanation : The presence of freckles, light skin patches , and a rubbery swelling in the neck in this 15-year-old boy strongly points to neural tumours. Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) is a genetic disorder that often presents with freckling in the axillary (called Crowe's sign ) or inguinal areas and cafÃ©-au-lait spots (the skin patches). These skin findings are characteristic of the disorder. Neurofibromas , are benign neural tumours that arise from the nerve sheath and commonly appear as soft, rubbery, non-tender swellings in affected areas like the neck. Cystic hygroma (Option A) is a type of cavernous haemangioma , present since the time of birth, which is benign and grows rapidly in years, often over the neck or axilla. It is not associated with freckles or cafÃ©-au-lait spots. Chemodectoma (Option B) (Paragangliomas) arise from paraganglia , which are clusters of neuroendocrine cells located in various parts of the body. They are commonly found in the head and neck regions . Freckles and skin patches are not typically associated with them but rather with Peutz-Jeghers syndrome . Lipomas (Option D) are benign fatty tumours that can occur in various body parts, including the neck. They are usually soft, movable , and painless , but they do not present with freckles or cafÃ©-au-lait spots .

      "explanation": "Hematoma (SDH) , which can occur from torn bridging veins and lead to headache, altered mental status, and focal neurological deficits. Subdural Hematoma (SDH) Causes Tearing of bridging veins , often due to blunt trauma / acceleration-deceleration injuries. Mechanism High-energy injury: Rupture of cortical surface vessels . Low-energy injury: Venous bleeding , common in older adults on anticoagulants. Clinical Presentation Variable presentation depending on injury severity and timing. Signs of raised intracranial pressure: Headache, reduced consciousness, focal neurological deficits. CT Appearance Diffuse concave hyperdense (acute), isodense (subacute), or hypodense (chronic) lesions over the brain surface, often crossing suture lines. Management Depends on size, location, and clinical status: 1. Large or worsening hematomas: Urgent evacuation by craniotomy or craniectomy. 2. Smaller, stable bleeds: Conservative management initially, with surgery if needed. Multi-infarct dementia (Option A) occurs due to multiple small strokes over time, leading to gradual cognitive decline rather than acute symptoms after trauma. On imaging, multiple small infarcts are seen, often in subcortical or deep brain areas, not an acute blood collection like in a subdural hematoma. Frontal lobe meningioma (Option B) is a slow-growing tumour that usually causes gradual symptoms like seizures or focal deficits, not acute neurological changes after a fall. On CT or MRI, it appears as a well-defined mass, often calcified, with possible brain compression, but not as an acute blood collection like in a subdural hematoma. Korsakoff disease (Option C) is caused by chronic alcohol use leading to thiamine deficiency and results in severe memory impairment, not acute symptoms after a fall. Imaging may show brain atrophy, especially in the mammillary bodies, but no acute haemorrhage or mass effect like a subdural hematoma.",

        "D": "Cerebral contusion"
      },
      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "diagnosis is Diffuse Axonal Injury (DAI) , which often appears normal on CT despite causing severe neurological damage. Diffuse Axonal Injury (DAI) A form of primary brain injury caused by widespread damage to axons due to rotational acceleration and deceleration forces, often associated with high-energy trauma. Cause Rotational forces: High-energy accidents involving rapid acceleration and deceleration (e.g., motor vehicle collisions). Trauma: Blunt force impacts that cause the brain to rotate within the skull. Clinical Features Impaired arousal : Often presents as coma or reduced consciousness due to damage in critical brain areas (e.g., pontine reticular activating system, bilateral thalami). Neurological deficits: Poor neurological examination despite the absence of obvious radiographic global brain injury. Irreversible consequences: DAI is often associated with severe and lasting neurological impairment. Investigations CT scan: May show hemorrhagic foci in the corpus callosum and dorsolateral rostral brainstem in severe cases. MRI: More sensitive than CT . It shows small haemorrhages and diffuse axonal injury, particularly in patients who fail to improve neurologically. Postmortem examination: Confirms the diagnosis with axonal disruption and formation of axon balls. Prognosis Very poor due to high risk of severe disability or death due to extensive brain damage. Subdural hemorrhage (Option A) would usually cause a gradual decline in GCS, and a CT scan would typically show a crescent-shaped blood collection. The normal CT scan, in this case, makes subdural hemorrhage less likely. Extradural haemorrhage (Option B) presents with a brief loss of consciousness followed by a lucid interval, and a CT scan typically shows a convex-shaped blood collection. The normal CT, in this case, makes extradural hemorrhage unlikely. Cerebral contusion (Option D) can result from trauma and may cause neurological deficits; they typically appear as focal areas of haemorrhage or swelling on a CT scan. A normal CT scan, as seen here, makes this diagnosis less likely.",

It is a scale that ranges from 3 to 15, with lower scores indicating more severe injury and higher scores indicating a better level of consciousness. In this case, the patient's GCS score is 10, which falls in the range of 9-12. According to the GCS scoring system, this indicates moderate traumatic brain injury.

      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: B) Angiography Explanation: In a patient presenting with a subarachnoid haemorrhage (SAH) and a severe headache, angiography is the most appropriate next step. This is crucial for identifying the source of the haemorrhage, such as an aneurysm or arteriovenous malformation (AVM). Subarachnoid Hemorrhage: Causes: Most common: Trauma Ruptured Aneurysm : Most commonly located in the Circle of Willis. Arteriovenous Malformation (AVM) Perimesencephalic SAH : Bleeding is confined to the basal cisterns due to venous bleeding and is associated with a better prognosis. Risk factors: Female sex Hypertension Smoking & Cocaine use Genetic disorders (e.g., adult polycystic kidney disease , Marfan syndrome) Symptoms: Thunderclap Headache : Sudden and severe headache. Associated with Seizures (10%), Unresponsiveness (50%) and Vomiting (70%) Diagnosis: CT Scan : First-line imaging , effective within 12 hours of onset, and its sensitivity decreases after one week. Fisher Grading for SAH on CT: Grade I No bleeding. Grade II Diffuse SAH with layers <1mm thick. Grade III Localised clots or SAH layers >1mm thick. Grade IV SAH minimal/absent, with intracerebral/intraventricular haemorrhage. Lumbar Puncture : Used if CT is negative but SAH is suspected. Digital Subtraction Angiography (DSA) : Gold standard for visualising aneurysms. Management: Surgical or endovascular intervention and addressing complications such as vasospasm and electrolyte imbalances . Early and effective treatment is crucial for improving outcomes. Nimodipine (Option A) is a calcium channel blocker commonly used in the management of SAH to prevent vasospasm, a frequent complication. However, it is not the immediate next step after the diagnosis of SAH. Surgery (Option C) may be needed to treat the cause of SAH, such as a ruptured aneurysm. However, angiography is generally performed first to identify the location and extent of the aneurysm before proceeding with surgery. Fibrinolytic therapy (Option D) is not typically used in the acute management of SAH. It is designed to dissolve intravascular clots and improve blood flow in ischemic conditions, but it is not indicated for SAH.

      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: C) E2V3M4 Explanation: Eye-opening (E) : The patient opens their eyes in response to a painful stimulus, which corresponds to E2 (eye-opening to pain). Verbal response (V) : The patient speaks inappropriately, corresponding to V3 (inappropriate words). Motor response (M) : The patient withdraws their limbs in response to a painful stimulus, which corresponds to M4 (withdraws to pain).

      "question": "Which of the following conditions is associated with perineural invasion?",
      "options": {
        "A": "Adenoid cystic carcinoma",
        "B": "Pleomorphic adenoma",
        "C": "Mucoepidermoid tumour",
        "D": "Pancreatic cancer"
      },
      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: A) Adenoid cystic carcinoma Explanation: Adenoid cystic carcinoma is known for its tendency to invade along nerves (perineural invasion) , which is a key feature of its aggressive nature. Adenoid cystic carcinoma: This type of cancer primarily affects the submandibular and sublingual salivary glands, with approximately half of the cases occurring in minor salivary glands, especially in the palate. It is relatively rare in the parotid gland. Clinical features: Facial nerve palsy Pain or numbness High risk of distant metastasis, especially - lung. Histopathology of adenoid cystic carcinoma: Type: Unencapsulated, infiltrative biphasic neoplasm. Cell Types: Variable proportions of epithelial and myoepithelial cells. Patterns: Cribriform: Cells around sharply punched-out cylindromatous spaces with basophilic matrix. It is the most common type and has a better prognosis. Tubular: Bilayered tubules with a true lumen. Solid: Sheets and nests of tumour cells without a lumen. Carries poor prognosis. Nuclear Features: Small, angulated, hyperchromatic nuclei with scant cytoplasm. Perineural Invasion: Common in adenoid cystic carcinoma. High-Grade Transformation: Can occur Immunohistochemistry: Ductal cells: Positive for c-KIT. Myoepithelial cells: Positive for p63 and SMA. Incorrect Options: Pleomorphic adenoma (Option B) : This tumour generally does not show perineural invasion unless it undergoes a malignant transformation. Even in cases of malignancy, vascular invasion is more commonly seen than perineural invasion. Mucoepidermoid tumour (Option C) : While mucoepidermoid tumours can invade surrounding tissues, including nerves, perineural invasion is less common compared to adenoid cystic carcinoma. Pancreatic cancer (Option D) can invade adjacent structures and spread to distant organs, but perineural invasion is not a characteristic feature of this type of cancer.

      "question": "Which of the following is the next step in the management of an old patient who has undergone complete excision of glioblastoma ?",
      "options": {
        "A": "Chemotherapy with Bevacizumab",
        "B": "No further management",
        "C": "Chemoradiation",
        "D": "Radiotherapy"
      },
      "correct_answer": "D",
      "explanation": "management typically involves adjuvant therapy to target any residual tumor cells and prevent recurrence. Radiotherapy, also known as radiation therapy, is a crucial component of adjuvant treatment for glioblastoma. It helps to destroy any remaining cancer cells in the brain following surgery, reducing the risk of tumor recurrence and improving overall survival rates. Therefore, radiotherapy is the appropriate next step in the management of an old patient who has undergone complete excision of glioblastoma. Incorrect Options: Option A - Chemotherapy with Bevacizumab: While chemotherapy is an essential component of the treatment for glioblastoma, particularly in conjunction with radiotherapy, the use of Bevacizumab (Avastin) specifically is not typically the next step after complete excision of the tumor. Bevacizumab is a monoclonal antibody that targets vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and is often used in the treatment of recurrent glioblastoma or as a second-line therapy. It is not typically the first choice for adjuvant treatment immediately following surgical excision. Option B - No further management: This option is incorrect because after surgical excision of glioblastoma, adjuvant treatment is essential to target any remaining cancer cells and prevent recurrence. Without further management, there is a high risk of tumor recurrence, which can lead to worsening symptoms and reduced survival rates. Therefore, no further management is not an appropriate option in this scenario. Option C - Chemoradiation: While chemoradiation (combining chemotherapy and radiotherapy) is a common treatment approach for glioblastoma, it is typically used as initial treatment or as adjuvant therapy following partial surgical resection. Complete excision of the tumor reduces the need for immediate chemoradiation as the primary treatment modality. Therefore, opting for chemoradiation immediately after complete excision may expose the patient to unnecessary side effects without clear benefit. Reference: Prepladder Notes",
