      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: B) Peripheral Zone Explanation: The majority of prostate cancers originate in the peripheral zone according to McNeal’s Zonal classification of the prostate. Anatomy of prostate: Location : Immediately inferior to the bladder. It surrounds the first 3 cm of the urethra. Capsules: True capsule: Fibrous capsule formed by the condensation of the peripheral part of the gland. False capsule: Visceral layer of pelvic fascia. Prostatic venous plexus are embedded in it on either side. Anatomical lobes (5 lobes): Anterior and posterior lobes; two lateral lobes; and one median lobe. McNeal Zonal classification of prostate gland: Peripheral zone: most common site for carcinoma. (Option B) Periurethral transition zone: most common site for BPH. (Option A ruled out) Central zone: surrounds the ejaculatory ducts. (Option C ruled out) Anterior Fibromuscular Stroma : Non-glandular area, and surrounds an inferior portion of the prostate called the apex (Option D ruled out)",

      "question": "A 75-year-old man presents with difficulty in urination, weak stream, and increased frequency. On digital rectal examination, his prostate is found to be enlarged, and his PSA levels are mildly elevated. Which enzyme converts testosterone to dihydrotestosterone, a hormone responsible for the pathogenesis of his condition? β Hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase I reductase",

      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "I reductase Correct Answer: C) 5 I reductase Explanation: The patient likely has benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) . Dihydrotestosterone (DHT) is the androgen that stimulates prostate growth . 5- α reductase is the enzyme that converts testosterone into DHT , making it central to BPH pathogenesis. Inhibitors of 5- α reductase (e.g., finasteride, dutasteride) are used in treatment. Testosterone Metabolism & BPH Enzyme Function 5- α Reductase Converts testosterone to DHT → promotes prostate growth Aromatase Converts androgens to estrogens 17- β Hydroxysteroid DH Converts androstenedione ↔ testosterone; not involved in DHT production 21-Hydroxylase Involved in cortisol/aldosterone synthesis, not androgen pathway Aromatase (Option A): Incorrect. Converts testosterone to estradiol, not involved in DHT production. 17- β Hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (Option B): Incorrect. Helps convert androstenedione to testosterone but not to DHT . 21-Hydroxylase (Option D): Incorrect. Important in cortisol and aldosterone synthesis, unrelated to androgens or BPH .

TURP Syndrome (Dilutional hyponatremia): Pathophysiology: Fluid is absorbed intravascularly due to high volumes of hypotonic irrigation fluid used during the resection causing dilutional hyponatremia and various neurologic symptoms. Risk factors: Size of prostate > 75g Duration of surgery > 90 minutes Pre-existing hyponatremia Renal failure Clinical features: Confusion, agitation, nervousness, nausea, hemolysis, visual disturbances, coma, and shock.

Persistent fever, perineal pain, and a tender, swollen prostate on examination raise suspicion of prostate abscess. A transrectal ultrasound or CT pelvis is needed to evaluate and manage the condition.

      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: B) Hypermethylation of GSTP1 Explanation: In this scenario, the most likely diagnosis is carcinoma prostate and the common genetic alteration seen in carcinoma prostate is hypermethylation of GSTP1 (Glutathione transferase promoter region 1) located in chromosome 11. Carcinoma prostate: Most common malignant tumor in men over the age of 65 years. Most common among Afro-American Risk factor: Advanced age High-fat diet Protective factors: (LESA) L ycopene Vitamin E S elenium Vitamin A Pathology: Most common site- peripheral zone (75%) > transitional zone (15%) > central zone (10%) Most common histological type is adenocarcinoma Most common genetic alteration seen in CA prostate- hypermethylation of GSTP1 (Glutathione transferase promoter region 1) located on chromosome 11.

Haematuria Pelvic pain, back pain, arthritic pain in sacroiliac joint-features of secondaries On per rectal examination: hard, nodular, irregular often with loss of median groove. Routes of spread: Most common route of spread- haematogenous (skeletal metastases: pelvic bones and the lower lumbar vertebrae) Other routes- local, lymphatic Mutation of the BRCA1 gene (Option A) : Men with BRCA2 mutations have an increased risk, but not the commonest genetic mutation for ca prostate. Overexpression of HER2 (Option C) : It is associated with breast cancer. Mutation of the RB1 gene (Option D) : It is associated with retinoblastoma.

        "D": "Observation with no immediate treatment"
      },
      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: C) Hormone therapy and possibly radiation Explanation: A Gleason score of 9 (4 + 5) indicates a very high-grade and aggressive prostate cancer , likely to spread rapidly. The elevated PSA level and high Gleason score suggest advanced disease. Hormone therapy , which reduces or blocks testosterone, is a key treatment for advanced prostate cancer. Radiation therapy may also be considered to control local disease . Investigation Key Points DRE Physical examination; detects nodules but limited in early-stage PSA Test Measures PSA levels; elevated levels suggest cancer TRUS Imaging with rectal probe; detects abnormalities mpMRI Advanced imaging; superior for staging and capsular spread Prostate Biopsy Gold standard for diagnosis; tissue sampling for cancer cells Gleason Score Purpose: Predicts cancer aggressiveness and potential for spread. Important for prognosis and treatment planning. Scoring System: Ranges from 6 to 10, based on gland appearance and differentiation. Two most common patterns in the biopsy are graded and summed for the final score. Gleason Score Grade Components Cancer Grade Description 6 3 + 3 Low-grade Cells resemble healthy tissue; low likelihood of growth and spread. 7 3 + 4 or 4 + 3 Intermediate-grade Cells show more variation; moderate risk of growth and spread. 8 4 + 4, 3 + 5, or 5 + 3 High-grade Cells look very different; higher likelihood of rapid growth and spread. 9 or 10 4 + 5, 5 + 4, or 5 + 5 Very high-grade Cells are highly aggressive; very likely to grow and spread quickly. CA Prostate Management: Management Strategy Key Points Active Surveillance (Option A ruled out) For low-risk cases; regular monitoring Radical Prostatectomy (Option B ruled out) Surgery for localized cancer; potentially curative Radiation Therapy High-energy rays; external or brachytherapy Hormone Therapy (Option C) Reduces/block testosterone; for advanced/metastatic cases Chemotherapy Systemic drug treatment; for advanced/metastatic cases Observation with no immediate treatment (Option D ): is inappropriate for aggressive, high-grade cancers like a Gleason score of 9, where immediate treatment is necessary.

T2a : Involves one lobe. (Option C ruled out) T2b : Involves more than half of one side but not both sides. T2c : Involves both sides, confined within the capsule. T3 : Tumor extends through the capsule. T3a : Unilateral or bilateral extension. (Option D ruled out) T3b : Extension into seminal vesicles. T4 : Tumor invades adjacent structures (e.g., levator muscles, external sphincter, rectum, pelvic sidewall). N0 : No regional lymph node involvement N1 : Regional lymph node involvement M0 : No distant metastasis M1 : Distant metastasis present Additional Staging Factors Gleason Score : Grading system based on cancer cell resemblance to healthy tissue. PSA Level : Blood test measuring prostate-specific antigen; elevated levels may indicate prostate cancer. Imaging Tests : MRI and bone scans used to detect cancer spread.
