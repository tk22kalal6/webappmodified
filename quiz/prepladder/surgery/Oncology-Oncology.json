      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: B) Liposarcoma Explanation: Liposarcoma remains the most commo n soft tissue sarcoma in adults. Liposarcoma Origin: A malignant tumour arises from adipocytes or fat cells. Characteristics: Liposarcomas are typically large at the time of diagnosis, often because they grow in the retroperitoneum or other deep tissues where they can expand without causing early symptoms. They can vary from well-differentiated to poorly differentiated, with the latter being more aggressive. Presentation: Patients may present with a painless, enlarging mass. In the retroperitoneum, symptoms may be related to the compression of nearby organs. HPE reveals a tumour composed of adipocytes with atypical spindle cells. Leiomyosarcoma (Option A) arises from smooth muscle and is another common type of soft tissue sarcoma but less common than liposarcoma. Rhabdomyosarcoma(Option C) is more commonly seen in children and arises from skeletal muscle. Angiosarcoma(Option D ) is a malignant tumour that arises from the endothelial cells lining blood vessels or lymphatic channels. Reference: Bailey & Love’s Short Practice of Surgery, 28th edition",

      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: B) Metastasis to lungs Explanation: Metastasis is the most common cause of death in patients with high-grade soft tissue sarcomas, including dedifferentiated liposarcoma. Soft tissue sarcomas often invade nearby blood vessels, allowing cancer cells to enter the circulatory system. Vascular invasion is a significant prognostic indicator, suggesting a higher likelihood of hematogenous spread. The most common site of metastasis in soft tissue sarcoma is Lung . Process of metastasis Metastasis typically indicates a poorer prognosis and may require systemic treatments and local management and local management. Haemorrhage due to tumour rupture (Option A) can occur, especially with significant vascular involvement or during surgery, but it is not the leading cause of death. Infection secondary to immunosuppression (Option C) can be a complication, particularly in patients undergoing treatment, but it is less common as a primary cause of death compared to metastasis. Local recurrence leading to organ failure (Option D ) occurs when a tumour reappears at or near the site of the original tumour after treatment , but it is also less commonly the primary cause of death compared to metastatic spread.",

        "A": "Liposarcoma",
        "B": "Leiomyosarcoma",
        "C": "Angiosarcoma",
        "D": "Rhabdomyosarcoma"
      },
      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: C) Angiosarcoma Explanation: Angiosarcoma is a malignant tumour that arises from the endothelial cells lining blood vessels. It has a higher propensity to metastasise via the lymphatic system than other sarcomas. History of radiation therapy is a significant risk factor. Clinically, it presents as a red-brown, indurated, and ulcerated skin lesion . It can spread through lymphatic and hematogenous routes , but due to the tumour's vascular nature, hematogenous spread (via blood vessels) is more common. The liver and lungs are common sites of metastasis, reflecting the tumour's aggressive nature. The majority of soft tissue sarcomas spread via the hematogenous route; however, some exceptions primarily spread through the lymphatic system, including: Tumor Type Description Lymphatic Spread Angiosarcoma Malignant tumour from endothelial cells of blood vessels. It can spread via lymphatic channels. Synovial Sarcoma Arises near joints and synovial tissues. Sarcoma of Extremities Various sarcomas are located in limbs. It can spread to regional lymph nodes. Gastrointestinal Stromal Tumor (GIST) Originate from interstitial cells of Cajal in the gastrointestinal tract. Primarily hematogenous but can spread via lymphatics. Liposarcoma (Option A) , Leiomyosarcoma (Option B) , and Rhabdomyosarcoma (Option D) primarily spread hematogenously rather than through lymphatics.

      "question": "A 45-year-old male presents with a rapidly enlarging, painless mass in his right thigh, which has been growing over a few months. The mass is firm, deep-seated, and non-tender on examination. What is the investigation of choice for diagnosing the underlying condition in this patient?",

        "A": "Contrast-Enhanced CT (CECT)",
        "B": "MRI",
        "C": "Tru-cut biopsy",
        "D": "PET-CT"
      },
      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: C) Tru-cut biopsy Explanation: The clinical presentation is characteristic of Liposarcoma, a malignant tumour arising from adipocytes (fat cells). The definitive diagnosis is made via histopathological examination, often through a tru-cut biopsy. Tru-cut biopsy Aspect Details Purpose A minimally invasive procedure to obtain a tissue sample from a suspicious mass or tumour for histopathological examination is often used to diagnose soft tissue sarcomas. Procedure A needle is inserted into the mass under imaging guidance (e.g., ultrasound, CT) to retrieve a core of tissue for microscopic analysis to determine the nature and characteristics of the tumour. Advantages Minimally invasive compared to surgical biopsy. Provides sufficient tissue for accurate histological diagnosis. Outpatient procedure with minimal recovery time. Limitations The sample size is relatively small, potentially not representing the entire tumour if it is heterogeneous. Risk of sampling error leading to potential misdiagnosis. Contrast-enhanced CT (CECT) (Option A) helps assess the extent of the tumour and any potential metastasis but is not definitive for diagnosing soft tissue sarcomas. MRI (Option B) is excellent for delineating the extent of the tumour and its relationship to surrounding structures, especially in soft tissues. It helps in preoperative planning but is not sufficient for definitive diagnosis. PET-CT (Option D) is useful for staging and detecting metastasis but not for initial diagnosis.

      "correct_answer": "D",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: D) Histological Grade Explanation: The histological grade is the most crucial prognostic factor in soft tissue sarcomas, as it directly reflects the tumour's biological behaviour, aggressiveness, and potential response to therapy. Prognostic factors for soft tissue sarcoma Prognostic Factor Importance Histological Grade Comprehensive assessment of tumour aggressiveness; Depth of Tumor Tumours deep into the fascia are more likely to be malignant and have a poorer prognosis. (Option C) Size of Tumor Larger tumours (>5 cm) are more likely to be malignant and associated with a worse prognosis. (Option A) Presence of Necrosis Indicates high-grade tumours with aggressive behaviour. (Option B) Vascular Invasion Associated with a higher risk of metastasis and worse prognosis Perineural Invasion Suggests aggressive behaviour and the potential for local spread Positive Resection Margins Higher risk of recurrence if cancer cells remain at the edges of surgical resection Reference: Bailey & Love’s Short Practice of Surgery, 28th Edition, Pages 589-591.",

      "question": "In the surgical management of soft tissue sarcoma, which of the following criteria is most appropriate for achieving optimal outcomes?",
      "options": {
        "A": "Wide local excision with a 1 cm margin",
        "B": "Radical excision with removal of adjacent muscle groups",
        "C": "Wide local excision with a 2 cm margin",
        "D": "Radical excision with lymph node removal"
      },
      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: C) Wide local excision with a 2 cm margin Explanation: Wide local excision with a 2 cm margin ensures complete tumour removal while preserving function and minimising tissue loss. This approach effectively reduces the risk of local recurrence. Wide local excision with a 1 cm margin (Option A) may be inadequate for many soft tissue sarcomas, potentially leading to higher rates of local recurrence. Radical excision with removal of adjacent muscle groups (Option B): It is often overly aggressive and can lead to unnecessary functional impairment without significantly improving outcomes in most cases. Radical excision with lymph node removal (Option C) is generally not necessary for most soft tissue sarcomas, as they typically spread hematogenously rather than through lymphatics, and routine lymph node dissection is not standard practice unless there is evidence of lymph node involvement.

      },
      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: C) Rhabdomyosarcoma Explanation: The clinical presentation and histopathology features suggest Rhabdomyosarcoma , a malignant tumour that arises from primitive mesenchymal cells committed to the skeletal muscle lineage. It is the most common soft tissue sarcoma in children and adolescents. It can occur anywhere in the body, but common sites include the head and neck, genitourinary tract, and extremities. It typically presents as a painless, rapidly growing mass, often in the head and neck region. Histopathology reveals small round blue cells with features of skeletal muscle differentiation. Immunohistochemistry confirms the diagnosis with positive for muscle markers like desmin, myogenin, and MyoD1. Treatment involves a multimodal approach, including surgery, chemotherapy, and often radiation therapy. Prognosis varies widely depending on subtype, location, stage, and age at diagnosis. Ewing Sarcoma (Option A) typically presents with small, round blue cells with scant cytoplasm lacking muscle differentiation. It commonly affects bone or soft tissue in children and young adults and is often associated with the EWSR1-FLI1 fusion gene. Neuroblastoma (Option B) usually originates from the adrenal gland or sympathetic ganglia in young children. Histology reveals small, round blue",

      "explanation": "Correct Answer: B) Liver Explanation: Retroperitoneal sarcomas, including liposarcomas, spreads primarily via the portal veain , and the liver >Lungs is the most common site of metastasis. Retroperitoneal Sarcomas are rare, aggressive tumours often diagnosed late due to non-specific symptoms. Subtypes include liposarcoma, leiomyosarcoma, and malignant fibrous histiocytoma. Treatment: Surgery is the mainstay, often followed by radiation or chemotherapy. Prognosis: Depending on size, grade, and resectability, local recurrence is common. Bone metastases(Option C): Uncommon for retroperitoneal sarcomas but a primary metastatic site for prostate, breast, and lung cancers. Brain metastases(Option D): Rare for retroperitoneal sarcomas but a common metastatic site for lung cancer, breast cancer, and melanoma.

Tumor Lysis Syndrome An oncological emergency which results when the release of intracellular metabolites overwhelms the kidney’s excretory capacity during cancer treatment. Due to tumour cell lysis, there is the release of uric acid, potassium and phosphorus, leading to hyperuricemia, hyperkalemia and hyperphosphatemia, respectively, which in turn leads to hypocalcemia and acute renal failure. This condition is commonly seen in poorly differentiated lymphomas (high-grade lymphoma, Burkitt’s lymphoma) and leukaemias (chronic leukaemia, ALL-acute lymphoblastic leukaemia). Management includes, Aggressive hydration to correct plasma volume (Option A) Correction of lactic acidosis by Sodium bicarbonate) Correction of hyperuricemia by Allopurinol, Rasburicase, etc. (Option B) Hemodialysis is also done in case of renal failure.

Superior Vena Cava (SVC) syndrome: It occurs when the superior vena cava is obstructed, often due to bulky mediastinal lymph nodes or a right upper lobe tumour compressing or invading the vessel. This obstruction severely reduces venous return from the head, neck, and upper extremities, leading to clinical manifestations such as: Variable degrees of swelling of head, neck and arms along with cyanosis. Headache, conjunctival oedema, dizziness, and syncope can be seen Some other features, such as nasal stuffiness, epistaxis, and tongue swelling, may also be seen. Dyspnea, dysphagia, cough and hoarseness of voice can also be seen in case of compression of mediastinal structures. Chest X-ray suggests a widening of superior mediastinum (Option A). The investigation of choice is CT scan (Option D) . MRI (Option B) and ultrasound (Option C) are not the investigations of choice, though mediastinal mass can be seen and diagnosed. Management of this syndrome depends on the cause. In cases of tracheal obstruction, a tracheostomy might be done.",

Desmoid tumour Also known as aggressive fibromatosis, it is a rare fibroblastic neoplasm with aggressive infiltrative behaviour but no metastatic potential. Generally, it arises in musculoaponeurotic structures (Option B) in the abdominal wall. This tumour can occur anywhere in the body but is more common in the abdominal wall. Predisposing risk factors include, History of surgical incision/trauma. Estrogen stimulates its growth (Option D) It is more commonly seen in females (Option C) It is often associated with FAP (familial adenosis polyposis) (Option A) and Gardner’s syndrome. Gardner's syndrome is an autosomal dominant form of polyposis characterized by osteomas, polyposis coli and mesenchymal tumors of skin and soft tissue. Biopsy is the investigation of choice which shows multinucleated plasmodial giant cells. Below is the histopathological image showing fibromatosis infiltrating skeletal muscles. MRI can also be done to determine the extent of the tumour. Treatment includes wide local excision, but as recurrence is high, surgical excision followed by radiotherapy can also be done in such cases.
