      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "The edge is the transition zone between the margin and the floor of the ulcer. If the image shows a raised, rolled, undermined, or punched-out border , it indicates the edge of the ulcer. Parts of an Ulcer Part Description Margin (Option A ruled out) Outer limit of the ulcer, usually blending into the surrounding skin/mucosa. Edge The border between the margin and the ulcer floor, may be raised (malignant), undermined (tuberculous), or punched-out (syphilitic). Floor (Option C ruled out) The exposed surface inside the ulcer, may contain slough, granulation tissue, or necrosis. Base (Option D ruled out) The structure beneath the ulcer, which can be soft tissue, bone, or a vessel.",

      "question": "In a patient experiencing excessive bleeding, with limbs displaying low temperature and reduced central venous pressure (CVP), what type of shock is observed?",
      "options": {
        "A": "Cardiogenic shock",
        "B": "Hypovolemic shock",
        "C": "Obstructive shock",
        "D": "Hypo adrenal shock"
      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: B) Hypovolemic shock Explanation: The type of shock seen in a patient with profuse bleeding, cold extremities, and decreased central venous pressure (CVP) is \"Hypovolemic shock.\" It occurs due to a significant loss of blood or fluid volume, leading to insufficient circulation and oxygen delivery to tissues. Pathophysiology of Hypovolemic shock The decreased cardiac output leads to Inadequate tissue perfusion, lactic acidosis, metabolic acidosis along with Compensatory mechanism activation & increased sympathetic tone cause an increase in PR & TPR. Cardiogenic shock (Option A) is due to the primary failure of the heart to pump blood. It may be due to myocardial infarction, cardiomyopathy, or blunt myocardial injury. Obstructive shock (Option C) is characterised by a reduction in preload due to mechanical obstruction of the cardiac filling of the left and/or right side of the heart, which in turn leads to a fall in cardiac output. Hypoadrenal shock (Option D) stems from inadequate cortisol release during stress, illness, or trauma, often due to chronic glucocorticoid use or adrenal insufficiency related to metastatic disease, amyloidosis, bilateral adrenal haemorrhage, etomidate, TB, or idiopathic atrophy.

      "question": "In a hypotensive patient with a head injury, which of the subsequent fluids should be avoided?",
      "options": {
        "A": "0.9% NS",
        "B": "5% Dextrose",
        "C": "Ringer lactate",
        "D": "3% saline"
      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: B) 5% Dextrose Explanation: In a hypotensive patient with a head injury, 5% dextrose should be avoided because it is a hypotonic solution, and its administration can lead to cerebral oedema and ICP by reducing serum sodium. The aim of fluid resuscitation in such cases is to improve circulation without worsening intracranial pressure or causing cerebral oedema. Isotonic crystalloids like 0.9% NS are preferred for fluid resuscitation in head injuries (Option A ruled out) Ringer Lactate (Option C) is an isotonic solution mainly used in aggressive volume resuscitation from blood loss or burn injuries. Its osmolarity of 273 mOsm/L is slightly lower than plasma but still within an isotonic range; it could increase intracellular space volume, leading to an increase in intracranial pressure in brain-injured trauma patients. 3% saline (Option D) is a hypertonic solution that is a preferred treatment for head injuries that involve increased intracranial pressure (ICP). It helps reduce brain oedema by drawing fluid out of the brain cells into the bloodstream. They also support circulatory stability by increasing blood pressure and cardiac output .
