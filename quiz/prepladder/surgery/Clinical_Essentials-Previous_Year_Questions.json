      "question": "A patient with diffuse severely contaminated peritonitis underwent laparotomy and was left open after surgery. Which of the following might help?",
      "options": {
        "A": "VAC",
        "B": "Normal saline soaked gauze",
        "C": "Prefer closure after laparotomy",
        "D": "Antibiotic soaked gauze"
      },
      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "effective method for managing open abdomen cases after laparotomy in severe, contaminated peritonitis . It helps by: Reducing edema and improving perfusion. Removing infectious material through negative pressure therapy. Facilitating faster wound healing by promoting granulation tissue formation. Preventing abdominal compartment syndrome , which can occur if primary closure is forced in a swollen abdomen. Open Abdomen Management in Contaminated Peritonitis Management Option Effectiveness in Open Abdomen Key Considerations VAC Therapy Highly effective Reduces infection, removes fluids, aids healing Normal Saline Soaked Gauze Temporary benefit Keeps wound moist but does not actively remove exudates Primary Closure After Laparotomy Not preferred in contamination Risk of abdominal compartment syndrome & infection Antibiotic-Soaked Gauze Limited benefit Does not provide negative pressure drainage Normal Saline Soaked Gauze (Option B): Incorrect because it only provides a moist environment but does not actively help with infection control or wound healing. Prefer Closure After Laparotomy (Option C): Incorrect because immediate closure is not ideal in diffuse contamination , as it increases the risk of abdominal compartment syndrome and sepsis . Antibiotic Soaked Gauze (Option D): Incorrect because while it may help prevent infection, it does not provide negative pressure therapy needed for wound contraction and fluid removal.

      "question": "A patient presents to the emergency department with confusion. On examination, he opens his eyes to pain, shows abnormal flexion to pain, and is disoriented in speech. What is his Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score?",

        "A": "11",
        "B": "12",
        "C": "10",

      "question": "Which structures are preserved during radical neck dissection?",
      "options": {
        "A": "Digastric muscle",
        "B": "Sternocleidomastoid muscle",
        "C": "Spinal accessory nerve",
        "D": "Ipsilateral cervical lymph nodes"
      },
      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "responsible for opening and closing the jaw, is typically spared during a radical neck dissection. Preserving the digastric muscle helps maintain normal jaw function and prevents complications related to swallowing and speech. Incorrect Options: Option B. Sternocleidomastoid muscle: This option is incorrect. The sternocleidomastoid muscle, located on the side of the neck, is often partially or completely removed during a radical neck dissection. Its removal allows access to deeper structures and lymph nodes in the neck, especially in cases where cancer has spread. Option C. Spinal accessory nerve: This option is incorrect. The spinal accessory nerve (also known as cranial nerve XI) is commonly sacrificed during a radical neck dissection. This nerve innervates the sternocleidomastoid muscle and the trapezius muscle. Sacrificing the spinal accessory nerve can result in shoulder weakness or dysfunction. Option D. Ipsilateral cervical lymph nodes: This option is incorrect. Ipsilateral cervical lymph nodes, referring to lymph nodes on the same side as the affected neck, are typically removed during a radical neck dissection. The procedure aims to remove the lymph nodes that may contain cancer cells or be at risk of involvement. Reference: .",
