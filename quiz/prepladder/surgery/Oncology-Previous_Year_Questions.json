Ulceration of overlying skin suggests an aggressive nature, which is common in borderline or malignant phyllodes tumors . Histopathology confirms the diagnosis by showing stromal hypercellularity and cleft-like spaces resembling leaf-like structures . Phyllodes Tumor Feature Description Age Group 30-50 years Growth Rapid, large lobulated mass Surface Uneven, bosselated Histology Stromal overgrowth, leaf-like pattern Treatment Wide local excision / mastectomy Galactocele (Option B): Incorrect because it occurs in lactating women due to ductal obstruction , presenting as a smooth, cystic mass without ulceration. Fibroadenoma (Option C): Incorrect because it is a well-defined, mobile mass with smooth surface , lacking ulceration and stromal overgrowth. Paget’s Disease (Option D): Incorrect because it involves the nipple-areolar complex , with eczematous changes , and is associated with underlying ductal carcinoma .",

      "question": "Which patient has better prognosis in breast cancer?",
      "options": {
        "A": "Her2+",
        "B": "Triple negative",
        "C": "Luminal B",
        "D": "Luminal A"
      },
      "correct_answer": "D",
      "explanation": "estrogen receptors (ER) and/or progesterone receptors (PR) . HER2-negative: These cancers do not overexpress the HER2 (human epidermal growth factor receptor 2) protein. Prognosis: Luminal A breast cancers are generally less aggressive and tend to have a favorable prognosis . They typically respond well to hormone therapies like tamoxifen or aromatase inhibitors. Growth and Spread: These cancers usually grow more slowly compared to other subtypes. Incorrect Options: Option A - HER2-positive (HER2+): HER2-positive: These cancers overexpress the HER2 protein, making them more aggressive . Prognosis: Before targeted therapies, HER2-positive breast cancers had a worse prognosis. However, the advent of HER2-targeted therapies (e.g., trastuzumab/Herceptin) has significantly improved outcomes for these patients. Aggressiveness: Although treatable with targeted therapies, HER2+ cancers are more aggressive than Luminal A cancers. Option B - Triple-Negative: Triple-negative: These cancers lack estrogen receptors (ER) , progesterone receptors (PR) , and HER2 expression. As a result, they do not respond to hormonal therapies or HER2-targeted treatments. Aggressiveness: Triple-negative breast cancers (TNBC) are typically aggressive , and treatment options are limited to chemotherapy, surgery, and radiation. Prognosis: TNBC has a poorer prognosis compared to Luminal A due to its aggressive nature and lack of targeted treatment options. Option C - Luminal B: Hormone receptor-positive (HR+): Like Luminal A, Luminal B cancers express ER and/or PR . HER2 Status: Luminal B cancers can be either HER2-positive or HER2-negative . Aggressiveness: Luminal B cancers tend to be more aggressive than Luminal A cancers, with higher rates of proliferation (faster-growing). Prognosis: Although still better than HER2-positive or triple-negative breast cancers, Luminal B cancers have a worse prognosis compared to Luminal A due to their higher growth rates and possible HER2 positivity.

      "correct_answer": "D",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: D) Malignant melanoma Explanation: Given the rapid growth, pigmentation, and associated itching, the most likely diagnosis is Malignant melanoma. Malignant melanoma Definition Melanoma is a malignant tumour arising from melanocytes at the epidermal-dermal junction. Though it is a rare skin cancer, it has a high mortality rate. It presents as a pigmented lesion that enlarges, ulcerates, or bleeds. Risk factors Positive family history. Fair skin. Genetics: CDKN2A (chromosome 9p21 ), MC1R, and TYR genes. Nevus: Congenital melanocytic nevi. Junctional nevi. Atypical nevi. Dysplastic nevi. Diagnostic criteria (P neumonic : ABCDE) Asymmetry: Irregular shapes. Border: Irregular. Colour: Various colours present or uneven distribution. Diameter: > 6 mm . Evolution: Changes in lesion over time (size, shape, itching, or bleeding) Investigations Clinical examination. Dermoscopy. Biopsy. Immunohistochemistry: The markers are S-100, HMB-45 (the most specific), Melan-A (MART-1), and MITF. CT scan. Management Wide local excision (with margins measured before excision and determined by Breslow depth, sentinel lymph node biopsy indicated for tumours with a depth of >1.0 mm). If the tumour is aggressive: Immunotherapy. Chemotherapy. Targeted therapy. Interferon- I is the only adjuvant treatment that has documented beneficial effects on overall survival. Dysplastic nevus (Option A), also called as atypical moles, are abnormal moles that have irregular borders, varied pigmentation, and larger size and are at higher risk of developing into melanoma. However, they typically grow slowly and don’t cause rapid enlargement or significant itching. Congenital melanocytic nevus (Option B) are present at birth and are usually large, pigmented moles. They generally grow slowly over time. They don't usually grow rapidly in adulthood or cause itching, unlike the lesion described in this case. They also have a higher risk of developing melanoma.",

      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: B) Lung Explanation: The most common primary source of metastasis to the brain is lung cancer with approximately 47% of patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) showing brain involvement. This high prevalence is due to the vascular nature of the brain and the tendency of lung cancer cells to spread hematogenous Ca lung is the most common primary for metastasis to: (Pneumonic- KEPABS) K– Kidney E– Esophagus P– Pancreas A– Adrenal B– Brain S– Skin Thyroid (Option A) can metastasise to the brain, but it is not as common compared to lung cancer. Thyroid cancer more commonly spreads to the bones and lungs. Liver (Option C) cancer, particularly hepatocellular carcinoma, does not commonly metastasise to the brain. It usually spreads to the lungs and other abdominal organs. Breast (Option D) cancer is also a common cause of brain metastases, but it is not as common as lung cancer. However, it remains a significant cause, particularly in cases of advanced-stage breast cancer. Reference: Sabiston’s Text Book of Surgery, 21st Edition, Page 1585 NIH Link .",

        "D": "Primary hepatocellular carcinoma"
      },
      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: C) Angiosarcoma of the liver Explanation: The patient's occupation, history of weight loss , abdominal pain , and hepatomegaly , coupled with the imaging findings of extensive haemorrhage and necrosis , strongly point to Angiosarcoma of the liver as the likely diagnosis. Hepatic Angiosarcoma Definition It is a high-grade vascular malignancy that arises from the endothelial cells lining blood vessels or lymphatic channels. It is the most common sarcoma arising in the liver, especially in those with significant exposure to Vinyl chloride. Common in Men and elderly Risk Factors Arsenic, Radiation, Thorium dioxide (Thorotrast) Metastasis It can spread through lymphatic and hematogenous routes , but due to the tumour's vascular nature, hematogenous spread (via blood vessels) is more common. The liver and lungs are common sites of metastasis, reflecting the tumour's aggressive nature Clinical presentation It presents as a red-brown, indurated, and ulcerated skin lesion. Cavernous hemangioma (Option A) is the most common benign liver tumour. It appears as a discrete red-blue, soft nodule less than 2 cm in diameter, commonly located in a subcapsular location. It does not explain the severe symptoms or the findings of tumour necrosis and haemorrhage in this case. Metastatic carcinoma of the liver (Option B) refers to the spread of cancer from other sites to the liver. While it can cause hepatomegaly and liver involvement, the description of extensive necrosis and hemorrhage is more suggestive of a primary malignant tumour. Primary hepatocellular carcinoma (Option D) is the most common primary malignancy of the liver. It typically presents with symptoms like hepatomegaly , weight loss , and abdominal pain . However, the extensive necrosis and hemorrhage described in this case are more characteristic of angiosarcoma rather than HCC .

      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: A) Liposarcoma Explanation: Liposarcoma is the most commonly seen malignant tumour of the retroperitoneum, accounting for a significant portion of retroperitoneal tumours. They are the most common adult sarcoma and commonly occur in the sixth and seventh decades. Three subtypes are: Well-differentiated: chromosome 12 amplification, including p53 inhibitor MDM2. Myxoid: t(12;16) translocation. Pleomorphic Rhabdomyosarcoma (Option B) is a malignant tumour arising from skeletal muscle progenitors. It is the most common soft tissue sarcoma in children and adolescents, and it commonly presents in the extremities, not the retroperitoneum. Synovial sarcoma (Option C) is a rare, slow-growing cancer that affects the soft tissues. It is commonly found in the arm, leg, or foot, and joints such as the wrist or ankle but it is not very common in retroperitoneum. Neurofibroma (Option D) is a benign nerve sheath tumour often associated with neurofibromatosis. While it can occur in the retroperitoneum, it is not as common as liposarcoma in that region.

Neoadjuvant Systemic Therapy (NAST) refers to treatments like neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NACT), targeted therapy, or hormonal therapy administered before surgery. The goal is to shrink the tumour and assess its in vivo response to therapy. Indications for Neoadjuvant Chemotherapy (NACT): Locally advanced breast cancer (T3, T4, N2, N3): To reduce tumor size. Select cases of early breast cancer : To downsize the tumour for breast conservation surgery (BCS). HER2/neu-positive tumors . Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC). Premenopausal women (age <50 years). Patients with axillary node metastasis . Neoadjuvant Targeted Therapy: Administered for HER2/neu-positive tumours >5 mm in size, using trastuzumab and pertuzumab . Neoadjuvant Hormonal Therapy: Offered to elderly or frail women with ER and/or PR-positive advanced tumours who are unfit for chemotherapy.

The image shows cancer involving both the lip and floor of the mouth , indicating invasion of adjacent structures, which is characteristic of T4a . Staging of Oral Cavity Cancer (AJCC 8th Edition): T (Primary Tumor): Tx Primary tumor cannot be assessed. Tis Carcinoma in situ. T1 Tumor ≤ 2 cm, ≤ 5 mm depth of invasion (DOI). T2 Tumor ≤ 2 cm, DOI >5 mm and ≤ 10 mm; or tumor >2 cm but ≤ 4 cm, and ≤ 10 mm DOI. (Option C ruled out) T3 Tumor >4 cm; or any tumor >10 mm DOI. (Option A ruled out) T4a Moderately advanced local disease - Invades through cortical bone, deep/ extrinsic muscle of tongue, maxillary sinus, or skin of the face. T4b Very advanced local disease - Invades masticator space, pterygoid plates, skull base, or encases internal carotid artery. (Option D ruled out) N (Regional Lymph Nodes): Nx Regional lymph nodes cannot be assessed. N0 No regional lymph node metastasis. N1 Metastasis in a single ipsilateral lymph node, ≤ 3 cm in greatest dimension. N2 N2a: Metastasis in a single ipsilateral node, >3 cm but ≤ 6 cm in greatest dimension. N2b: Metastasis in multiple ipsilateral nodes, all ≤ 6 cm). N2c: Metastasis in bilateral or contralateral lymph nodes, all ≤ 6 cm. N3 N3a: Metastasis in a lymph node >6 cm in greatest dimension, ENE(-). N3b: Metastasis in any node(s) with clinically overt ENE(+). M (Distant Metastasis): M0 No distant metastasis M1 Distant metastasis Reference: Bailey & Love's Short Practice of Surgery, 28th Edition, Pages 816, 817.",

      "explanation": "prevent kidney damage in tumor lysis syndrome (TLS). TLS is a dangerous complication of cancer treatment where cancer cells release their contents into the bloodstream, causing a buildup of uric acid that can harm the kidneys. Rasburicase, an enzyme, converts uric acid into a less harmful compound, reducing the risk of kidney damage. Incorrect Options: Option A - Furosemide : Rasburicase is a loop diuretic used to treat fluid retention and edema caused by various medical conditions such as heart failure, liver cirrhosis, and kidney disease. Option C - Corticosteroids : This is incorrect, as corticosteroids have no renal protective role in tumor lysis syndrome. Option D - Febuxostat: Febuxostat is another xanthine oxidase inhibitor used to lower uric acid levels in patients with gout. It is similar to allopurinol in its mechanism of action and is not the preferred drug for preventing renal damage in tumor lysis syndrome. Reference: Prepladder Notes",

Tumor lysis syndrome occurs when large numbers of tumor cells are rapidly destroyed, leading to the release of intracellular contents into the bloodstream. The characteristic features of tumor lysis syndrome include hyperuricemia, hyperkalemia, and hyperphosphatemia. Tumor lysis syndrome can cause hypocalcemia due to the deposition of calcium phosphate crystals in tissues. Incorrect Options: Options B, C and D are incorrect.
