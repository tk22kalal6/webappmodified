      "question": "A 62-year-old male presents with left leg swelling and pain for 5 days and has a positive D-dimer test. Duplex ultrasonography confirms an extensive DVT involving the left popliteal and femoral veins. Which of the following is the most appropriate initial management strategy?",
      "options": {
        "A": "Unfractionated heparin followed by warfarin",
        "B": "LMWH followed by oral anticoagulant",
        "C": "Catheter-directed thrombolysis",
        "D": "IVC filter placement"
      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: B) LMWH followed by oral anticoagulant Explanation: Treatment of DVT: Anticoagulation: For initial management of acute DVT without contraindications to anticoagulation, the current recommended approach is to start with LMWH and transition to an oral anticoagulant. This approach has several advantages: LMWH provides rapid anticoagulation without the need for monitoring. Oral anticoagulants have shown non-inferiority or superiority to warfarin in large clinical trials. They have a better safety profile and do not require regular INR monitoring. This regimen allows for outpatient management in many cases, reducing hospitalization rates. Investigation of DVT: Venous Doppler with Duplex scanning Non-invasive; detects thrombus by impaired blood flow and inability to compress veins. Presence of echogenic material completely filling the lumen of vein Absence of compressibility Absence of blood flow Venogram Accurate for detecting and locating thrombus and differentiating occlusive and non-occlusive thrombus but less commonly used due to invasiveness. Impedance Plethysmography Measures changes in venous volume and flow using a cuff. Less useful for calf DVT and previous thrombosis. Fibrin and Fibrinogen Assays Measures fibrin degradation products, including D-dimer. D-dimer has a high negative predictive value. Radioactive Fibrinogen Study Uses radiolabeled fibrinogen to detect thrombus. Less commonly used. Magnetic Resonance Venous Imaging (MRVI) Non-invasive; Useful for imaging iliac veins and IVC. Management of DVT : Initial Anticoagulation Subcutaneous LMWH: Rapidly anticoagulate confirmed DVT cases. Intravenous Unfractionated Heparin: For patients with significant renal impairment. Fondaparinux or Bivalirudin: Alternatives for those with heparin sensitivity or heparin-induced thrombocytopenia. Transition to Oral Anticoagulation Duration: At least 3 months or longer based on risk factors or recurrence. Novel anticoagulants (NOACs): Rivaroxaban, Apixaban (factor Xa inhibitors), Dabigatran (direct thrombin inhibitor). Vitamin K Antagonists: Warfarin (alternative to NOACs).

      "explanation": "thigh and calf Correct Answer: B) Incompetence of the great saphenous vein with varicose veins on the medial thigh and calf Explanation: Incompetence of the great saphenous vein with varicose veins on the medial thigh and calf: Saphenofemoral Junction Ligation and GSV Stripping are indicated primarily for varicose veins resulting from GSV incompetence, particularly when these veins are located on the medial thigh and calf. Open Surgery Procedure Saphenofemoral Junction Ligation and Great Saphenous Vein Stripping Indication: Used for varicose veins in the medial thigh and calf due to great saphenous vein (GSV) incompetence. (Option B) (Option C ruled out) Procedure: An incision is made in the groin to access the saphenofemoral junction where the GSV meets the femoral vein. Tributaries of the GSV are ligated. Stripping: The GSV is tied off at the junction, and a device is inserted into the GSV and pulled out through an incision near the knee, stripping the vein as it is removed. Saphenopopliteal Junction Ligation and Small Saphenous Vein Stripping Indication: Used for varicose veins on the posterolateral calf due to small saphenous vein (SSV) incompetence. (Option A ruled out) Procedure: An incision is made to access and ligate the saphenopopliteal junction where the SSV joins the popliteal vein. Stripping: Similar to the GSV procedure, the surgeon either strips the vein using a device or resects the proximal portion of the vein.",

      "question": "A 55-year-old male with chronic venous insufficiency presents with a venous ulcer on his lower leg. He has a history of prolonged standing at work and reports aching and heaviness in his legs. What is correct regarding compression therapy in this patient?",
      "options": {
        "A": "Class 1 compression hosiery exerts 18-24 mmHg of pressure",
        "B": "Compression bandaging typically exerts less pressure than compression hosiery",
        "C": "Compression bandaging should be avoided in patients with a history of venous ulcers",
        "D": "Compression therapy is most effective when it exerts a graduated pressure to promote venous return"
      },
      "correct_answer": "D",
      "explanation": "promote venous return Correct Answer: D) Compression therapy is most effective when it exerts a graduated pressure to promote venous return. Explanation: Compression therapy works by exerting graduated external pressure on the legs, which helps promote blood flow back to the heart and reduces venous hypertension. This is particularly important in conditions like varicose veins where venous return is compromised. Compression Therapy in Varicose Veins Mechanism: Graduated external pressure promotes venous return. Reduces venous pressure, especially in a standing position. Types of Compression: Compression Hosiery: Knee-length or thigh-length garments. Indications: Varicose Veins: Alleviates symptoms; first-line therapy. Post-Intervention: Used after varicose vein treatments. Minimizes complications, promotes healing, and prevents recurrence. Long-term Prevention: Lifelong Class 2 stockings are recommended Categories based on pressure levels: Class Pressure (mmHg) Class 1 14–17 (Vs Option A) Class 2 18–24 Class 3 25–35 Compression Bandaging: Multi-layered approach for desired pressure. Compression bandaging applies more pressure than hosiery and is more often used in cases like venous ulcers or more severe conditions. (Vs Option B) Indications: Venous Ulcers: Essential for ulcers from venous insufficiency; use 35–40 mmHg pressure. (Vs Option C) Mixed Ulcers: Caution with arterial disease; use 30 mmHg if ABPI 0.5–0.8. Severe Arterial Compromise: Revascularization advised before bandaging if ABPI < 0.5 or ankle pressure < 60 mmHg. Components and their roles in compression bandaging: Condition ABPI Pressure (mmHg) Venous Ulcers (no arterial disease) Not Applicable 35–40 Mixed Ulcers (with arterial disease) 0.5–0.8 30 Severe Arterial Compromise <0.5 or ankle pressure < 60 mmHg Revascularization is needed before compression Post-Intervention & Recurrence Prevention: Minimizes complications post-treatment. Prevents recurrence, especially with persistent reflux or deep venous occlusion. Lifelong use of Class 2 below-knee stockings is often recommended. Benefits: Alleviates symptoms, promotes ulcer healing and prevents ulcer recurrence/new varicose veins. Limitations: Challenges with patient compliance. Risk of skin breakdown if applied incorrectly.

      "question": "Which of the following statements about the pathophysiology of varicose veins is incorrect?",
      "options": {
        "A": "Defects in the walls or valves of the veins lead to retrograde blood flow.",
        "B": "Inflammatory changes in walls lead to dilatation, elongation and valvular dysfunction.",

        "D": "Chronic ambulatory venous hypertension develops."
      },
      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: C) The veins have a low end-diastolic volume. Explanation: The pathophysiology of varicose veins includes the development of an increased end-diastolic volume. Pathophysiology of varicose veins: An anatomic or dynamic cause leads to the damage of the valvular system. Inflammatory changes affect the walls of the valves as well. (Option A) This leads to the retrograde blood flow and pooling of blood. This causes an increase in the end-diastolic volume in the veins. The superficial (visible) and deep venous systems are affected by this, which causes their dilatation (varicosity), elongation, and even leads to secondary valvular dysfunction. (Option B) This causes an increased ambulatory venous hypertension. This is responsible for the complications of varicose veins. (Option D) Decreased amounts of elastin and an imbalance between collagen I and III suggest that the loss of the venous wall intimal architecture leads to dilation, tortuosity, and the formation of varicose veins .

      "explanation": "Correct Answer: C) Marjolin’s ulcer Explanation: Marjolins ulcer A Marjolin ulcer is a type of skin cancer that develops in areas of chronically damaged skin, such as old scars, burns, or non-healing wounds. It most commonly presents as squamous cell carcinoma Venous ulcer Prevalence Responsible for 85% of all chronic limb ulcers. Causes Venous disease (superficial or deep vein incompetence or obstruction) Arterial ischemic ulcer Vasculitic ulcer Traumatic ulcer Neuropathic ulcer Neoplastic ulcer Infections. Pathophysiology Old theories: Fibrin cuff theory and white cell trapping theory but these have not been confirmed. Presently: Ambulatory venous hypertension is the primary cause. Clinical Features Gaiter's Zone: Common ulcer location around and above the medial malleoli due to numerous perforators. Ulcer: Large with gently sloping edge and granulation tissue, nonhealing, tender, recurrent with secondary infections. Surrounding skin often shows thickening, inflammation, induration, pigmentation (hemosiderosis) and fibrosis . (Option A) Lipodermatosis: Chronic inflammation, fibrosis and thickening of the skin and subcutaneous tissue of the lower leg with pigmentation and a tight, contracted appearance, often with Achilles tendon contracture. Suggests severe chronic venous disease and gives a champagne bottle appearance. Investigations Duplex scan : To assess deep and superficial veins. Biopsy: For atypical ulcers or suspected malignancy (e.g., Marjolin's ulcer). Additional tests: Full blood count, blood glucose, ESR/CRP, sickle cell test, antibody screening if ulcer appears atypical. Management Compression Therapy Superficial venous ablation or surgery Bisgaard Method: Measures to reduce edema, increase venous drainage and promote ulcer healing Elevation Massage of indurated area Passive and active exercise Other Treatments: Pentoxifylline, horse chestnut extract, biological dressings, grafts and antibiotics. Complications Hemorrhage Periostitis over tibia Marjolin's Ulcer: Well-differentiated ulcer (squamous cell or basal cell carcinoma) occurring in chronic scars (e.g., burn scars, venous ulcers). Indurated, painless, non-tender ulcer with raised, everted edges and surrounding fibrosis. (Option C) Treatment: Wide local excision Infection Talipes equinovarus Disability Pressure ulcers (Option B) are the most common complication in bedridden patients or those with spinal cord injuries over bony prominences due to prolonged pressure. Marjolin's ulcer refers to a malignant transformation arising from burn scars or chronic non-healing wounds such as pressure ulcers over many years. Actinic Keratosis (Option D) are precancerous lesions that can lead to squamous cell carcinoma (SCC). Ill-marginated, erythematous, scaling, and rough papules or patches, often with signs of solar damage (atrophy, uneven pigmentation, telangiectasias).",

      },
      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: C) 1:3 Explanation: In the Tessari technique, the typical ratio of sclerosant to air is 1:3. This ratio is used to create a stable foam with a larger surface area, which improves contact with the vein walls during sclerotherapy. Sclerotherapy A sclerosing agent, typically sodium tetradecyl sulphate , is injected into the affected vein. This agent damages the vein lining, causing it to collapse and eventually be absorbed by the body. To enhance the effectiveness of the sclerosant, it is mixed with air to create a foam . This foam allows for greater contact with the vein wall and displaces blood that could inactivate the sclerosant Indications: Telangiectasias, reticular veins, and small, nonaxial varicose veins (<6 mm) visible in chronic venous disease; suitable for patients with persistent symptoms despite medical management. Aspect Tessari Technique Sclerosants Indications and Contraindications Foam Preparation Two syringes: one with sclerosant, one with air/gas (CO2) Connected via multi-way stopcock. Sclerosant to air ratio is usually 1:3 or 1:4 Repeated plunger action to create foam STS: Synthetic sodium salt with anesthetic properties Polidocanol: Synthetic polyethylene glycol, also an anesthetic. Effective for telangiectasias, reticular veins HTS: 23% hypertonic saline, osmotic agent Candidates: Asymptomatic patients and those with controlled recent or recurrent venous bleeding may undergo sclerotherapy without additional diagnostics. Contraindications: Avoid sclerotherapy during acute venous thrombosis or pregnancy. Risks : Microembolism risk Vessel Size: Suitable for veins up to 6 mm in diameter, including small, nonaxial varicose veins, reticular veins, and telangiectasias. Injection Technique Downstream injection from larger to smaller veins. Controlled foam volume to displace blood. Advantages Minimally invasive, enhanced efficacy, safety profile. Reduced volume requirement due to foam. STS: Rapid clearance in blood, effective for larger veins. Polidocanol: Decreased risk of thrombosis, suitable for smaller veins. Tessari technique",

        "D": "The duplex scan is primarily used to locate perforating veins"
      },
      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: C) Presence of perforator vein with a diameter >3.5 mm is significant. Explanation: Duplex imaging is the preferred modality for assessing venous insufficiency. A significant finding in duplex imaging is a perforator vein with a diameter greater than 3.5 mm and a reflux time of 500 milliseconds or longer, which indicates significant perforator reflux. This finding helps guide the management of varicose veins and associated symptoms. The duplex scan should NOT be performed with the patient in a supine position to evaluate reflux. In the supine position, valves may remain open without any flow, leading to an erroneous assessment. The correct method is to perform the scan with the patient standing or in a markedly trunk-elevated position to assess valve function and reflux accurately. (Option A) A reflux time of 500 milliseconds or longer is considered clinically significant, not <500 milliseconds. This threshold helps differentiate normal venous function from pathological reflux, which can contribute to varicose vein formation and chronic venous insufficiency. (Option B) The duplex scan is not primarily used to locate perforating veins. Instead, it is used to assess venous reflux in both superficial and deep veins , identifying incompetent valves and evaluating the overall function of the venous system. While perforator veins can be visualized, the scan’s main purpose is to determine the presence and extent of reflux.

Multiple tourniquet test: This test is done to locate the exact perforator that is incompetent. Procedure: The patient is asked to lie in the supine position, and the limb is elevated to empty the veins. Multiple tourniquets are tied just below the locations of the perforators (one below the saphenofemoral junction, one above the knee and one below the knee), and the patient is asked to stand. The tourniquets are removed one by one from below upwards, checking each segment of the leg for filling of blood. Once the tourniquet is removed and the segment drained by a perforator shows filling, it depicts the respective perforator",

        "D": "Presence of DVT"
      },
      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: C) Sapheno-femoral incompetence Explanation: The Brodie-Trendelenburg test/ Trendelenburg I test is done to determine the patency of the saphenofemoral junction and hence shows a saphenofemoral incompetence if filling from above is seen. Procedure: Patient is asked to lie in the supine position. The leg is elevated, the vein is emptied by “milking,” and a tourniquet is tied just below the saphenofemoral junction. Patient is asked to stand up quickly. The tourniquet is released. Observation: When there is rapid filling of blood from above, this signifies sapheno-femoral incompetence. Valvular incompetence (Option A) is determined by the Schwartz test . It involves tapping the lower end of the saphenous vein and feeling the impulse at the saphenofemoral junction in a standing position. This confirms the long, continuous column of blood in the vein due to valvular incompetence. Perforator incompetence (Option B) is determined by the Trendelenburg test II, which is similar to test I in that the patient is asked to stand up after the same steps. However, here, the tourniquet is not released, and the filling of blood from below signifies perforator incompetence. Presence of DVT (Option D) is determined by Perthe’s test, in which the patient is asked to walk around or exercise with an elastic bandage wrapped around the legs. The development of severe cramp-like pain in the calf determines DVT. Other tests for varicose veins: Modified Perthe’s test: For DVT After elevating the limb and emptying the veins, a tourniquet is applied at the SFJ and the patient is asked to walk around for a few minutes. If the dilated veins become more prominent, it signifies deep venous obstruction. Three tourniquet test: for specific perforator Fegan’s test for perforator: On standing, the line of varicosity is marked, and then the veins are emptied in the supine position. The examiner palpates along the marked line and notices any pits or gaps in the deep fascia that signify perforator incompetence at that site. Pratt’s test for perforator: Applying pressure to the calf muscle; if it feels tense and causes pain, it may indicate acute deep vein thrombosis (DVT). Morrisey’s cough impulse test for SFJ incompetence: The patient is asked to turn their face away from the examiner and cough while the examiner keeps a finger at the SFJ, and an expansile cough impulse is felt. Signifies SFJ incompetence. Ian-Aird test for SFJ incompetence. Reference: SRB’s Manual of Surgery, 6th Edition, Page 223, 224. Pratt",

        "D": "External iliac vein"
      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: B) Common femoral vein Explanation: The common femoral vein is the most likely to be involved next in the progression of this deep vein thrombosis. DVT typically propagates proximally, from the calf veins through the popliteal vein and into the femoral vein . The common femoral vein is the next major deep vein in the anatomical sequence above the popliteal vein. Most DVTs (about 90%) start in the calf veins, particularly in the soleal sinuses. From there, they can propagate proximally through the popliteal and femoral veins. Anatomy of Deep Veins in Lower Limb: Foot and ankle: Deep veins accompany the dorsalis pedis and posterior tibial arteries. Calf: Three pairs of deep veins - anterior tibial, posterior tibial (Option C) , and peroneal veins. These join to form the popliteal vein behind the knee. Thigh: The popliteal vein becomes the femoral vein as it passes through the adductor canal. The great saphenous vein (a superficial vein), and the deep femoral vein drain into the femoral vein in the femoral triangle when it becomes known as the common femoral vein. Pelvis: The common femoral vein becomes the external iliac vein (Option D) , which joins with the internal iliac vein to form the common iliac vein. Abdomen: The left and right common iliac veins join to form the inferior vena cava which goes on to the right atrium. Risk Factors for DVT: Virchow's triad: Venous stasis: Immobility (e.g., prolonged bed rest, long-distance travel) Paralysis Venous obstruction (e.g., pelvic tumors) Increasing age Hypercoagulability: Genetic thrombophilias (e.g., factor V Leiden mutation, protein C or S deficiency) Acquired conditions (e.g., malignancy, pregnancy, oral contraceptives) Antiphospholipid syndrome Vessel wall injury/Endothelial injury: Trauma Surgery Chemical irritants The great saphenous vein (Option A) is a superficial vein, not part of the deep venous system. DVT primarily affects the deep veins and is less likely to involve superficial veins.",

      "explanation": "Correct Answer: B) Small Saphenous Vein (SSV) system Explanation: The given anatomical description is characteristic of the Small Saphenous Vein (SSV) system as it runs at the posterior aspect of the calf . The risk factors in the above scenario suggest that this is likely a case of primary varicose veins , as opposed to secondary varicose veins that underlying conditions like deep venous thrombosis or syndromes like Klippel-Trenaunay would cause. Risk factors for varicose veins: Age: Incidence increases with age Gender: M/c in females Obesity Pregnancy and multiparity Prolonged standing or sitting Family history Previous deep vein thrombosis Hormonal factors (e.g., oral contraceptives, hormone replacement therapy) Classification based on involved veins: Great Saphenous Vein (GSV) system (Option A) typically involves the medial aspect of the leg and thigh. Small Saphenous Vein (SSV) system (Option B) involves the posterior aspect of the calf. Non-saphenous veins (Option C) include the lateral venous system.

        "D": "Medial knee, approximately 10 cm below the knee joint line"
      },
      "correct_answer": "D",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: D) Medial knee, approximately 10 cm below the knee joint line Explanation: The Boyd perforator vein , also known as the upper paratibial perforator , is typically located on the medial aspect of the leg, approximately 10 cm below the knee joint line. This perforator connects the great saphenous vein or its tributaries to the deep veins of the leg, specifically the posterior tibial veins. Superficial veins: Great Saphenous Vein (GSV): Originates from the medial marginal vein of the foot, ascends along the medial aspect of the leg and thigh, and drains into the common femoral vein at the saphenofemoral junction. Small Saphenous Vein (SSV): Begins at the lateral aspect of the foot, ascends posteriorly along the calf, and typically drains into the popliteal vein at the saphenopopliteal junction which then becomes the femoral vein. Perforator veins: Perforators connect the superficial and deep venous systems, allowing blood to flow from superficial to deep veins. Key perforators include: Ankle perforators: Cockett perforators (posterior tibial perforators): Three perforators located along the medial ankle and distal calf. May and Kusters perforators Calf perforators: Boyd perforator: Located approximately 10 cm below the knee joint on the medial aspect of the leg, connects the great saphenous and superficial femoral veins. Sherman perforator: Located in the mid-calf region. Thigh perforators: Dodd perforator: Located in the middle third of the medial thigh. Hunterian perforator: Located in the upper thigh, connecting the GSV to the femoral vein. Lateral perforators: Lateral calf perforators: Less clinically significant, connecting the lateral venous system to deep veins. The medial ankle, posterior to the medial malleolus, describes the Cockett perforators (Option A) , a group of three perforators located in the distal third of the leg. The medial calf, approximately 10 cm above the medial malleolus, is more consistent with the position of the middle Cockett perforator (Option B) , not the Boyd perforator. The lateral calf, at the junction of the middle and lower thirds location (Option C), does not correspond to any major named perforator vein. The lateral aspect of the calf contains smaller, less clinically significant perforators.",

        "B": "Thromboangiitis obliterans",
        "C": "Pancreatic malignancy",
        "D": "Polycythemia vera"
      },
      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: C) Pancreatic malignancy Explanation: This patient presents with symptoms of recurrent superficial thrombophlebitis, possibly migratory (thrombophlebitis migrans) . The recurrent nature and lack of obvious predisposing factors raise concern for an underlying systemic condition, particularly malignancy. Trousseau identified the association of migratory thrombophlebitis and malignant disease, involving the tail of the pancreas. This association, known as Trousseau's syndrome , is a classic presentation of occult pancreatic malignancy. Superficial Thrombophlebitis (STP)/ Superficial vein thrombosis Definition: STP is marked by inflammation and thrombosis of superficial veins, most often affecting the lower extremities. Frequently occurs in patients with varicose veins. Risk Factors: Includes prolonged immobility, recent surgery, trauma, obesity, and hypercoagulable states. It is associated Paraneoplastic syndrome with Adenocarcinoma of GIT - Pancreatic ca and Diffuse type of Gastric cancer Clinical Presentation: Symptoms include pain, erythema, and a palpable, tender, cord-like structure along the affected vein. The skin may be attached to the vein and later turns brown from erythematous. Diagnosis is primarily clinical but can be confirmed with duplex ultrasonography. Management Approaches: Limited STP (<5 cm, not involving the saphenofemoral junction): NSAIDs, elastic compression stockings, and mobilization. Extensive STP (>5 cm) or involvement of the great saphenous vein: Systemic anticoagulation with fondaparinux or low molecular weight heparin, typically for 45 days. STP involving the saphenofemoral junction: Full therapeutic anticoagulation, similar to deep vein thrombosis treatment. Complications: Progression to DVT (up to 18% of cases) and pulmonary embolism (up to 7% of cases). Long-term risks include post-thrombotic syndrome and chronic venous insufficiency. Prevention Strategies: Early mobilization post-surgery, use of compression stockings in high-risk patients, and prophylactic anticoagulation when indicated. While recent childbirth (Option A) is a risk factor for thrombophlebitis, it's not relevant in this case, given the patient's age and the recurrent nature of the symptoms over three months. Thromboangiitis obliterans (Buerger's disease) (Option B) typically affects young male smokers and involves both arteries and veins. It's less likely in this scenario compared to malignancy. Polycythemia vera (Option D) can be associated with thrombophlebitis, but the recurrent and migratory nature of the symptoms in this case is more suggestive of malignancy, particularly pancreatic cancer.",

      "explanation": "Correct Answer: B) Paget-Schrotter syndrome Explanation: Upper Extremity DVT Less common than lower extremity DVT, comprising ~5% of all DVT cases. Serious condition with a risk of pulmonary embolism in up to one-third of cases. Typically involves thrombosis of the axillary or subclavian veins. Categories Primary Idiopathic: Idiopathic upper extremity DVT Idiopathic cases warrant evaluation for occult malignancy. Paget-Schroetter syndrome (Option B) Effort induced thrombosis due to subclavian vein compression. Often seen in young athletes with repetitive upper extremity motion (e.g., swimming). Anatomic anomalies like cervical ribs or myofascial bands can cause venous compression. It may develop as a sequale of thoracic outlet syndrome Diagnosis may involve plain films to confirm thoracic outlet syndrome (as shown in the image below). Treatment: Initial thrombolysis followed by thoracic outlet decompression (first rib and scalene muscle resection). Surgical approach: Reconstruction of axillary and subclavian veins. Post-surgery: Anticoagulation for 6-12 months. Secondary: More common Due to indwelling central venous catheters, pacemakers, thrombophilia or malignant disease. Clinical Findings Unilateral swelling Pain Extremity discomfort Erythema Palpable cord Diagnosis Duplex ultrasonography Venography or magnetic resonance venography Treatment Anticoagulation therapy: Heparin or LMWH plus warfarin for at least 3 months is the mainstay of treatment. Thrombolysis does not significantly reduce long-term manifestations. Complication Recurrence Post-thrombotic syndrome (PTS) Thoracic outlet syndrome (Option A) can lead to Paget-Schrotter syndrome but is incorrect because the ultrasound confirmed the presence of a thrombus. Raynaud's phenomenon (Option C) causes episodic color changes in the fingers or toes in response to cold or stress, not with a thrombus in the subclavian vein. Lymphedema (Option D) results from impaired lymphatic drainage and usually develops gradually. It is less likely to occur suddenly after exercise.",

      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: A) Early mobilization along with compression stockings Explanation: The case scenario here is of an abdominopelvic surgery that needs early mobilization with compression stockings as a prophylaxis for preventing DVT. In the above scenario, the risk factor for DVT is pregnancy and immediate postpartum, along with having undergone an abdominopelvic surgery which only needs mechanical methods of prophylaxis rather than pharmacological. Risk groups for deep vein thrombosis: Older age groups (>40 yrs) Hospitalized and immobilized patients Pregnancy and the recently postpartum state Those on hormonal replacement therapy Women on oral contraceptive pills Major surgery Long haul travellers (>6hrs) With conditions like: Past venous thromboembolism Malignancies Nephrotic syndrome Varicose veins Antiphospholipid syndrome Myeloproliferative disorders Polycythemia Obesity Prophylaxis of deep vein thrombosis (DVT): Method of prophylaxis is either: Mechanical or pharmacological. Activation of the calf pump mechanism: Is an effective means of prophylaxis. Achieved by simply making the patient walk. Should be done within 24 or 48 hours of the surgery. Patients should never be advised tochange position from lying down into sitting in a chair position as it leads to venous pooling in the legs and is highly thrombogenic Smoking and if on any oral contraceptives, must be stopped before surgery. Pharmacological: 5000 IU of low-dose unfractionated heparin is given every 8 hours for reduction in venous thromboembolism. LMWH can be given and is a better choice as it needs no monitoring. It is the best option for moderate and high-risk patients. Dextran 70, IV 500ml during surgery and 500ml postoperatively in 24 hours can prevent DVT. Mechanical: Compression devices like compression stockings, and external pneumatic bandages can be used prophylactically during major surgeries, laparoscopic surgeries Elevation, massaging, early ambulation, and maintaining hydration are also key steps.

      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: C) Place a retrievable IVC filter Explanation: In this case, the patient has an acute DVT with a high risk of progression to pulmonary embolism. However, he also has significant contraindications to anticoagulation: Thrombocytopenia (platelet count 40,000/ µ L) and Coagulopathy (INR 1.8). These factors make anticoagulation extremely high-risk. In such scenarios, where there is an acute proximal DVT and a contraindication to anticoagulation, placement of an IVC filter is indicated . The choice of a retrievable filter allows for potential removal once the contraindications to anticoagulation resolve (Option C). Reassessment in 3 months is appropriate to evaluate if the filter can be safely removed and anticoagulation initiated. IVC Filters: Mechanical devices designed to prevent pulmonary embolism by trapping large clots in the inferior vena cava. Indications Recurrent thromboembolism despite adequate anticoagulation Deep venous thrombosis in a patient with contraindications to anticoagulation Chronic pulmonary embolism and resultant pulmonary hypertension Complications of anticoagulation Propagating iliofemoral venous thrombus in anticoagulation Types Two main types of IVC filters: Permanent filters: Designed for lifelong use Retrievable (temporary) filters: Can be removed when no longer needed Retrievable filters offer the flexibility of removal once the risk of pulmonary embolism has decreased or anticoagulation becomes feasible. This approach helps mitigate the long-term complications associated with permanent filters. Indications of Retrievable IVC Filter Prophylactic placement in high-risk trauma patients (orthopedic, spinal cord patients) Short-term duration, contraindication to anticoagulation therapy Protection during venous thrombolytic therapy Extensive iliocaval thrombosis Complication Migration or embolization of the filter Fracture of the filter Perforation of the IVC or adjacent structures IVC thrombosis Post-thrombotic syndrome Start anticoagulation with LMWH (Option A) is incorrect due to the high bleeding risk associated with the patient's active GI bleeding, thrombocytopenia, and coagulopathy. Place a permanent IVC filter (Option B): While an IVC filter is indicated, a permanent filter is not the best choice. Retrievable filters are preferred when possible, as they allow for removal once anticoagulation becomes feasible, reducing long-term complications associated with permanent filters. Start anticoagulation with UFH (Option D): Even anticoagulation with unfractionated heparin carries a significant risk of exacerbating the patient's bleeding complications.",

      "question": "A 45-year-old man with a history of colorectal cancer underwent surgery 3 weeks ago and is now presenting with complaints of left leg swelling and pain for 3 days. His left calf is 4 cm larger than the right. Using Wells' criteria for DVT, what is his pre-test probability score and risk category?",
      "options": {
        "A": "2 points; Moderate risk",
        "B": "5 points; High risk",
        "C": "3 points; Moderate risk",
        "D": "4 points; High risk"
      },
      "correct_answer": "D",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: D) 4 points; High risk Explanation: The Modified Wells' criteria for Deep Vein Thrombosis is a clinical prediction rule used to estimate the pretest probability for DVT. It helps clinicians determine the need for further diagnostic testing. The patient scores 4 points (Option C) on the Wells' criteria, placing them in the high-risk category. Malignancy (Including treatment done within past 6 month) (1 point) Recently bedridden for >3 days or major surgery within last 4 weeks (1 point) Calf swelling > 3 cm compared to the other leg (1 point) Entire leg swollen (1 point) This scoring system, when combined with D-dimer testing, helps in the diagnostic algorithm for DVT, potentially reducing unnecessary imaging studies in low-risk patients. Modified Well’s criteria for detecting DVT: Variable Score Lower limb trauma or surgery or immobilization in a plaster cast 1 Bedridden for >3 days or surgery in the last 4 weeks 1 Tenderness along the line of femoral or popliteal veins 1 Entire limb swollen 1 Calf >3 cm larger circumference than another side 10 cm below the tibial tuberosity 1 Pitting oedema 1 Dilated collateral superficial veins (not varicose veins) 1 Previous DVT 1 Malignancy (including treatment up to 6 months ago) 1 Intravenous drug abuse 3 Alternative diagnosis more likely than DVT -2 Low probability (5%) of DVT: score –2 to 0 Moderate probability (17%) of DVT: score 1 or 2 High probability (17–53%) of DVT: score >2 Reference: Bailey & Love's Short Practice of Surgery, 28th Edition, Page 1044, 1045",

      "question": "A 52-year-old male presents with a swollen, painful left calf that developed over the past two days. He reports no history of trauma, surgery, or prolonged immobility. Physical examination reveals a warm, erythematous, and tender left calf. Which of the following clinical features is most specific for diagnosing deep vein thrombosis?",
      "options": {
        "A": "Calf pain on dorsiflexion of the foot",
        "B": "Asymmetrical calf swelling",
        "C": "Pain that worsens with leg elevation",
        "D": "Localized tenderness along the course of the deep veins"
      },
      "correct_answer": "D",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: D) Localized tenderness along the course of the deep veins Explanation: Localized tenderness along the course of the deep veins is one of the most specific clinical signs of DVT. This symptom occurs due to a thrombus within the deep veins, which triggers pain when pressure is applied along the affected vein. Clinical Feature Significance 1. Localized tenderness Specific for DVT; indicates inflammation along the vein. 2. Asymmetrical calf swelling Common but not specific to DVT. 3. Erythema and warmth Suggestive of inflammation or thrombosis. 4. Pain in the affected limb Can occur with or without movement; can indicate venous obstruction. 5. Dilated superficial veins May indicate compensatory circulation due to deep venous obstruction. 6. Homans' sign Non-specific; Passive forceful dorsiflexion of the foot with extended knee will cause tenderness in the calf. 7. Mose’s sign Painful response to gentle squeezing of the lower calf from side-to-side. 8. Neuhof's Sign Thickening and deep tenderness in the calf muscles upon palpation. 9. Phlegmasia Alba Dolens DVT of the femoral vein causes painful congestion and edema of the leg with lymphangitis, which further increases edema (white leg). 10. Phlegmasia Caerulea Dolens Extensive DVT in iliac and pelvic veins leading to a blue leg with possible venous gangrene or infarction. Pratt's sign : Applying pressure to the calf muscle; if it feels tense and causes pain, it may indicate acute deep vein thrombosis (DVT). Calf pain on dorsiflexion of the foot (Option A): Homans' sign is the pain or Resistance of the calf muscles to forcible dorsiflexion of the foot. It has been traditionally associated with DVT but is not specific and should not be routinely elicited due to its lack of reliability. Asymmetrical calf swelling (Option B) is a common feature of DVT but is not specific. It can be present in other conditions, such as lymphedema or muscular injuries. Pain that worsens with leg elevation (Option C) is more indicative of arterial insufficiency . In DVT, the pain may worsen with dependency due to increased venous pressure.",
