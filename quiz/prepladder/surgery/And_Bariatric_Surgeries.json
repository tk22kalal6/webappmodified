      "explanation": "Correct Answer: C) Veress needle is a spring-loaded needle Explanation: Veress needle is a spring-loaded needle used to create a pneumoperitoneum. Methods of creating pneumoperitoneum. Closed technique Open technique Veress needle and/or visual entry trocar (Option A) The Veress needle is a spring-loaded needle (Option C) . It has: An outer sharp bevel that cuts. A spring-loaded blunt inner stylet (Option D) deploys once it enters the peritoneum and protects from injuries to the bowel and vessels. Inserted at the umbilical region or other sites like Palmer’s point. Once position is confirmed (by the hanging drop method or abdominal pressure reading of <10mmHg), CO2 insufflation is started slowly until a pressure of 12-15mmHg is reached. The needle is then removed, and an optical primary port is placed. Veress needle: Hasson’s or modified Hasson’s Umbilicus is the preferred site for a 10-12mm initial port placement. A blunt-tipped 10 to 12-mm trocar is pushed through an incision made through the decussation inferior to the cicatrix of the umbilicus. The laparoscopic camera is used to confirm the successful placement. (Option B) Then CO2 gas insufflation is started at low flow (1-4 litres per minute) Increased to a maximum pressure of 15 mmHg with a maximum flow rate of 20L/min . Trocar:",

      "correct_answer": "D",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: D) Laparoscopic adjustable gastric banding Explanation: Laparoscopic adjustable gastric banding: (Option D) Popularity decline Due to long-term results and alternatives. Procedure Uses the pars flaccida technique through the window of the lesser omentum. Band Placement: Positioned just below the esophagogastric junction to create a small virtual gastric pouch. Band Fixation: Sutured anteriorly with gastrogastric tunneling sutures to prevent slippage. Access Port: Sutured to the rectus sheath in the upper abdomen for easy access by a non-coring, Huber needle for adjustments. Types of adjustable bands Lapband (silicon) SAGB Image Mechanism of action Purely restrictive bariatric procedure. Reduces hunger, likely through vagal mediation. Treatment approach Initial Placement: Marks the start of treatment, requiring ongoing management. Band Adjustments: Involves specialist consultations to assess eating habits and then perform adjustments with injection or aspiration of saline to achieve optimal appetite control. Challenges Requires frequent adjustments, associated with patient frustration and lower compliance, impacting long-term weight loss. Follow up Monthly visits are recommended for the first year, with full multidisciplinary team (MDT) support. Complications Early: Access port infection (1%) Deep vein thrombosis(DVT)/ Pulmonary embolism (PE)(<0.1%) Late: Band infection Tubing leak Slippage Erosion into stomach Band intolerance Failure to lose weight/weight regain Intragastric Balloon Placement: (Option C) Method Minimally invasive, temporary procedure with an endoscopically placed balloon filled with saline or air into the stomach. Mechanism Balloon serves as a restrictive mechanism and promotes the feeling of satiation as it is a space-occupying device. Volume of balloon needed A 400 mL balloon or larger can effectively induce satiation. Effectiveness Can achieve 6-15% total body weight loss compared to lifestyle modification alone. FDA-Approved Balloons Obalon, Orbera, ReShape. Adverse Effects Common adverse effects: Pain, nausea, GERD, gastric ulcers, balloon migration Serious adverse effects: Small bowel obstruction, perforation, death. Patient Compliance Essential for success; Requires adherence to lifestyle modifications. Sleeve gastrectomy (Option A) involves resection of a large part of the stomach which regulates appetite, creating a tube-like structure. It is not a banding procedure. Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (Option B) involves the creation of a small gastric pouch from the proximal end of the stomach which is then connected with the distal jejunum, not a banding procedure.",

      },
      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: A) Reduced stomach size and hormonal changes. Explanation: Sleeve gastrectomy A recent, safe and effective surgical technique and a leading method in metabolic surgery for treating obesity with higher survival rates. Procedure Involves resection of a large part of the stomach, which regulates appetite. Does not require gastrointestinal anastomosis or intestinal bypass. Minimally invasive and less technically challenging. Image Mechanism of weight loss (Option A) Weight loss is achieved through both mechanical restriction (reduction of stomach size) and hormonal modulation (affecting hunger hormones such as ghrelin). Uses Weight Loss Reduce mental health problems Clinical Markers: Improve serum lipid profile, biochemical, histological, hematological and inflammatory markers. Obesity-related disease resolution: Better control of Type 2 diabetes, non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, cardiovascular risk, obstructive sleep apnea and stroke risk. Non-obesity related disease remission: Reduced gout attacks, musculoskeletal pain, improved fertility and reduced pregnancy complications and lower cancer incidence. Complications Early Leak at angle of His (1-2%) Intra-abdominal bleed (2-3%) Deep vein thrombosis(DVT)/ Pulmonary embolism (PE)(<1%) Late Nutritional: Iron, vitamin B12, calcium,vitamin D deficiency Gastro-oesophageal reflux Barrett's esophagus Weight regain Complete removal of the stomach (Option B): Sleeve gastrectomy only involves removing a portion of the stomach, not the entire stomach. This procedure leaves behind a tubular sleeve of the stomach with reduced size but preserves its essential functions. Reduced appetite with no hormonal impact (Option C): Sleeve gastrectomy not only restricts calorie intake but also leads to significant hormonal changes, such as reduced ghrelin production (a hormone that stimulates appetite), which plays a crucial role in promoting satiety and weight loss. Nutrient malabsorption due to intestinal bypass (Option D): Sleeve gastrectomy does not involve bypassing any part of the intestine, rather it focuses on reducing the size of the stomach without altering the intestinal tract, so malabsorption is not a primary mechanism.",

      },
      "correct_answer": "D",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: D) Preexisting iron deficiency anemia Explanation: A preexisting anemia is a contraindication for BPD-DS. Biliopancreatic diversion: It begins with a distal subtotal gastrectomy with a residual 200mL gastric pouch. The terminal ileum is divided 250 cm proximal to the ileocecal valve. The distal end is then divided and anastomosed to the stomach. A 2 to 3-cm stoma is created. Proximal end of the ileum is anastomosed side-to-side to the terminal ileum. Cholecystectomy is done prophylactically due to the high incidence of gallstone formation with malabsorption of bile salts. Duodenal switch: The only difference is that instead of a distal gastrectomy, resection of all the stomach except for a narrow lesser curvature of the stomach is performed. The duodenum is then divided in its first portion. The end of the duodenum is anastomosed to the distal 250 cm of ileum. Distal bowel configuration and cholecystectomy are similar to BPD. Indications: Higher BMIs (Option A) Failed another operation for weight loss or metabolic control (Option B&C). Contraindications: Geographic distance from the surgeon Lack of financial means to afford supplements Preexisting calcium, iron or other nutrient deficiencies (Option D). Complications: Bleeding Leakage GI obstruction Wound infections Marginal ulcers after BPD that lead to the adoption of DS. Nutritional complications: Most common Protein malnutrition Iron deficiency anemia Bone demineralization Alopecia (protein deficiency) Night blindness (vitamin A deficiency) Gallstones if gall bladder not removed Protein-calorie malnutrition: most severe & life-threatening.",

      "correct_answer": "D",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: D) Low-budget surgical setup Explanation: Robotic surgery is very expensive, so it is not suitable in a low-budget setup. It operates on a \"master-slave\" principle, with the surgeon (master) controlling the robot (slave) through hand movements. The robot’s wristed instruments replicate these movements precisely, avoiding the fulcrum issue of laparoscopic tools. This precision allows for fine motor skills in confined spaces. (Option A ruled out) Additionally, the robotic system includes filters to counteract tremors and can translate large movements into smaller, precise ones. (Option B ruled out) Remote operation is possible, making telesurgery feasible for hostile environments such as military, space missions, deep-sea exploration, and polar expeditions. Applied in: Prostatic surgery Gynecological surgeries (Option C ruled out) Some cardiac surgeries Urologic surgeries Endocrine surgery The disadvantages of robotic surgery: High cost Bulky and high setup time Significant resource requirements Trained personnel are still needed for patient preparation, port insertion, robot docking, instrument changes, and handling complications or unexpected issues.

      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: C) Natural orifice transluminal endoscopic surgery Explanation: The Natural orifice transluminal endoscopic surgery (NOTES) surgery is scarless as it is done via the natural body orifices (rectum, mouth, vagina). This technique can be applied to the pelvis , abdomen, and thorax . Closure of the visceral puncture site is a major issue that has prevented the uptake of this method. Transgastric, trans colonic closure of peritoneal entry sites in a safe way remains a problem. Significant cost and training implications have also limited more widespread adoption. Appendectomy and cholecystectomy are done with this method. Staging of intra-abdominal malignancy, segmental colectomy, and gastro-jejunostomy are also performed this way. Advantages : Complications like hernias and wound infections are also eliminated. Usage of a flexible endoscope used in NOTES allows access to remote areas of the peritoneal cavity more easily and quickly. Laparoscopic abdominal surgery (Option A), even though it leaves a very minimal scar, is not a scarless procedure. Laparotomy (Option B) has a midline incision along the linea alba that leaves a long scar. Hand-assisted laparoscopic surgery (Option D) involves the intra-abdominal placement of a hand or forearm through a mini-laparotomy incision while the pneumoperitoneum is maintained.",

Fast-track surgery (Option B) is a multimodal approach. It uses a combination of several evidence-based peri-operative interventions to improve recovery after surgery. It includes preoperative interventions like Evaluating and optimizing existing organ function Nutritional status Patient education about the entire process Minimal starvation (2h- liquids, 6h- solids) Oral carbohydrate drink No mechanical bowel preparation Operative interventions: Preoperative antibiotics, acid suppression, and pro-kinetic premedications Thoracic epidural analgesia Nasogastric decompression, urinary catheterization, and abdominal drainage Goal-directed fluid administration Maintain normothermia Minimal tissue handling Minimize operative time Minimal access surgery Post-operative measures: Multimodal, pre-emptive, and adequate analgesia Postop nausea and vomiting prophylaxis and/or treatment Early removal of all drains and tubes if inserted Early enteral nutrition Early enforced ambulation Ensure follow-up after discharge If a surgery requires a 23-hour stay with an overnight stay it is not day surgery. It is an overnight stay surgery (Option C) and the patient is discharged early morning. In short-stay surgeries (Option D) , the patient is admitted for 72 hours.

      "correct_answer": "D",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: D) Splenic trauma Explanation: Splenic trauma leads to bleeding, and this causes a collection of blood under the diaphragm ( Kehr’s sign ). This leads to the irritation of the diaphragm and referred pain via the phrenic nerve , hence the shoulder pain . This can also be due to CO2 used for insufflation that irritates the diaphragm. An intraabdominal abscess (Option A) is the most common complication that is seen in laparoscopic appendectomy. Mesenteric bleeding (Option B) , enterotomy, and ureteric injury are intraoperative complications seen in laparoscopic colectomy. Perforation of the esophagus (Option C) or stomach, splenectomy, and pneumothorax is the most commonly reported intraoperative complications of laparoscopic antireflux surgery.

      },
      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: C) Carbon dioxide Explanation: Carbon dioxide is the most frequently used gas for pneumoperitoneum, considering its inert quality and non-inflammable characteristics. CO2 insufflation is started slowly until an abdominal pressure of 12-15mmHg is reached. Although carbon dioxide meets most of the requirements for pneumoperitoneum, the absorption of CO2 may be associated with adverse events like cardiopulmonary complications and adverse events in people with high anesthetic risk which is avoided by hyperventilation. Other gases used for creating a pneumoperitoneum: Room air (Option A) has no cardiopulmonary complications or serious adverse effects and could be cheaper. It also showed less pain on the first post op day. However, the evidence was of low quality and hence not widely used. Oxygen (Option B) is a gas that aids combustion. The usage of oxygen with electrocautery in surgeries would lead to dangerous outcomes. Helium (Option D) was also studied to create a pneumoperitoneum. Not enough evidence was obtained about the cardiopulmonary effects of using helium. Serious adverse effects like subcutaneous emphysema were also noted. Nitrous oxide is also used for creating a pneumoperitoneum. No adverse effects were found, and has a lower pain score. Reference: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6481852/",

      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: B) Klebsiella is a frequent cause of drug-resistant hospital-acquired UTIs respiratory infections . (Option A) For respiratory tract infections, pathogens such as Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus, and Pneumocystis carinii are more common. Hospital Acquired Infections: Acquired infections after 48 hours of hospital admission that were neither present nor incubating at the time of admission. Spread by healthcare workers or between patients if aseptic measures are not followed. High-Risk Patients Diabetics Immunosuppressed individuals Patients on steroids, life-supporting machines. Instrumentation (indwelling catheter, IV cannula, tracheostomy tube) Patients with artificial prostheses Common Pathogens Wound infection: Staphylococcus aureus (most common), Pseudomonas, Klebsiella, E.coli, Proteus. Respiratory tract infections: Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus, Herpes, Varicella, Aspergillus, Pneumocystis carinii. UTIs: Klebsiella (most common). Antibiotic-associated diarrhea: Clostridium difficile. Management Most organisms invading are multidrug-resistant and virulent and hence cause severe sepsis. Antibiotics based on culture results. Blood, urine, pus for culture and sensitivity to isolate the organisms. Supportive care (e.g., ventilator, nutrition, maintaining optimum urine output). Prevention Isolate infected patients. Follow strict aseptic practices. Disinfect facilities, treat underlying conditions and proper nutrition. Klebsiella is indeed a frequent pathogen responsible for hospital-acquired urinary tract infections and is notably resistant to multiple drugs, making it a major concern in nosocomial infections. (Option B) Nosocomial infections can and do spread between patients. Transmission can occur through direct patient contact or contaminated equipment. (Option C) Patients with artificial prostheses are actually at increased risk for nosocomial infections compared to those with indwelling devices, due to the potential for infection at the site of the prosthesis and the complexity of managing such infections.

      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: A) Prompt reclosure of the fascia Explanation: Wound Dehiscence Disruption of any or all of the layers in a wound. Occurrence Up to 3% of abdominal wounds; most commonly occurs between the 5th and 8th postoperative days. Types Partial dehiscence: Involves only the skin and subcutaneous fat. Complete dehiscence: Involves the fascial layer and may include evisceration (extrusion of abdominal viscera). Risk Factors General: Malnourishment Diabetes Obesity Renal failure Jaundice Sepsis Cancer Treatment with steroids Emergency surgery Local: Inadequate or poor closure of wound or closure of a wound under tension Poor local wound healing Increased intra-abdominal pressure Clinical Presentation Pinkish serosanguinous discharge (salmon-coloured fluid), Possible evisceration, Popping sensation during straining or coughing. Treatment Partial dehiscence (without evisceration): Prompt reclosure of the fascia is generally advised. (Option A) Complete dehiscence with evisceration: Requires urgent reoperation. Tension suturing is done. Protect eviscerated bowel with moist towels; handle carefully to prevent injury. Antibiotic therapy; fluid management. Wound vacuums aid healing by reducing fluid and improving blood flow, but they are better for chronic wounds. (Option B) For partial dehiscence with intact fascia, prompt reclosure is needed, making this option less suitable. Antibiotics may be necessary if the infection is present, but discharging without addressing the dehiscence risks worsening into complete dehiscence and evisceration. (Option C) An abdominal binder supports intra-abdominal pressure but does not resolve the dehiscence. (Option D) Surgical reclosure of the fascia is required to prevent further complications.",

      },
      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: C) Place in Trendelenburg position. Explanation: Air Embolism Occurs when air enters accidentally into the vascular system.Commonly iatrogenic via interventional procedures, but also from trauma, diving, childbirth, and other circumstances. Causes Through venous access like IV cannula. Artificial Pneumothorax. Surgeries of neck and axilla. Traumatic opening of major veins sucking air inside. Fallopian tube insufflation. Laparoscopic surgeries. Illegal abortions. Symptoms Respiratory Distress, Hemoptysis, Convulsions, Unconsciousness, Visual and hearing disturbances, Fatigue and numbness, Paralysis, Hemodynamic instability, Coma. Diagnosis Patient history especially relation to recent procedures. Auscultation: Millwheel murmur heard over the precordium is diagnostic. ECG: ST depression and right heart strain due to pulmonary artery obstruction. Capnometry: Decreased end-tidal CO2 levels in intubated patients. Imaging: Chest X-ray, Doppler ultrasonography, transesophageal echocardiography (TEE). Treatment Positioning: Trendelenburg position: Keeps air bubbles away from coronary arteries. (Option C) Left lateral decubitus position: Helps trap air in the non-dependent segment of the right ventricle, preventing it from entering the pulmonary artery. Hyperbaric oxygen therapy: Useful in both venous and arterial air embolism as it reduces ischemia, bubble size; in arterial embolism it removes nitrogen from bubbles to improve perfusion and oxygenation. Aspiration: Air should be aspirated from the right ventricle with a needle. Open Thoracotomy: Life-saving procedure required to aspirate excess air causing the block. Administer a diuretic (Option A): Diuretics are used to manage fluid overload and do not address the issue of air in the circulation. They do not prevent or mitigate the effects of an air embolism. Perform CPR (Option B): CPR is necessary only if the patient is in cardiac arrest. In this case, the priority is to address the air embolism, not perform CPR. Epinephrine (Option C): Is used for cardiac arrest or severe allergic reactions, not specifically for managing air embolism. The immediate focus should be on positioning to prevent further complications.

      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "positive pressure in the operating room (OR). Correct Answer: A) Administering prophylactic antibiotics before the first incision and maintaining positive pressure in the operating room. Explanation: Administering prophylactic antibiotics before the first incision ensures that maximal antibiotic levels are present in the tissues when the incision is made, reducing the risk of bacterial contamination during surgery. Maintaining a positive pressure differential in the OR helps keep outside air from entering the sterile environment, which is crucial for preventing airborne contamination and thus reducing SSIs. (Option A) Prophylactic Considerations Details Prophylactic Antibiotics Administered before the first incision to ensure maximal antibiotic levels are present in tissues at the time of incision, reducing the risk of bacterial contamination. (Option C) Operating Room (OR) Air Pressure Positive pressure differential in the OR is essential to keep outside air from entering, preventing airborne contamination and reducing the risk of Surgical Site Infections (SSIs). (Option C) Antisepsis Application Technique Concentric circles are often used, but WHO guidelines state that the specific pattern (concentric circles, horizontal or vertical) does not significantly impact SSI prevention. (Option B) Operating Room Temperature Recommended OR temperature is 21 ± 3°C. A temperature of 18°C is too low, potentially causing hypothermia in patients, negatively affecting wound healing and outcomes. (Option B) Skin Antisepsis Solution Alcohol-based solutions like chlorhexidine alcohol are recommended for skin antisepsis because of their effectiveness in reducing transient organisms and preventing SSIs. (Option D) Antibiotic Selection Antibiotics with a short half-life might not maintain adequate tissue levels throughout surgery. Long-acting antibiotics or those that can be re-dosed during long surgeries are preferred.

      "explanation": "Correct answer: D) Caseating granulomas on intestinal biopsy Explanation: Caseating granulomas on intestinal biopsy are characteristic of intestinal tuberculosis and would distinguish it from typhoid fever. In tuberculosis, Histology shows caseating granuloma with giant cells. This finding is not seen in typhoid fever and is highly suggestive of tuberculosis. Evening rise in temperature (Option A) is seen in both conditions. Hence, this feature is not specific and cannot be used to distinguish intestinal tuberculosis from typhoid fever. Positive blood culture for Salmonella Typhi (Option B) would confirm typhoid fever, not distinguish it from tuberculosis. Multiple longitudinal ulcers in the terminal ileum (Option C) can be seen in Typhoid. Transverse ulcers with typically undermined edges are seen in tuberculosis. Features of Intestinal TB vs Typhoid: Feature Intestinal Tuberculosis Typhoid (Enteric Fever) Causative Organism Mycobacterium tuberculosis Salmonella typhi Mode of Transmission Ingestion of food contaminated with tubercle bacilli Fecal-oral route Gross Appearance (Ulcer Description) Ulcers are transverse, often circumferential, forming a \"girdle\" shape. Typically multiple ulcers. Located mostly in the Ileocaecal region. Ulcers are longitudinal, multiple and arranged in a parallel and antimesenteric pattern. Often occur in the terminal ileum and Peyer's patches. Ulcers can perforate, leading to peritonitis. Microscopic Features Presence of granulomas with caseating necrosis. Epithelioid cells and Langhans giant cells are common. Lymphoid hypertrophy is noted. Neutropenia and splenomegaly may also be observed. Clinical Presentation Dull, colicky abdominal pain, often in the right iliac fossa. Weight loss, fever, and anemia are common. Mass may be felt in the right iliac fossa (indicating ileocaecal involvement). Presents initially with fever, chills, and abdominal pain. Severe diarrhea, relative bradycardia, and abdominal tenderness are common. Complications Intestinal obstruction due to stricture formation. Risk of bowel perforation and fistula formation. Intestinal hemorrhage. Perforation leading to faecal peritonitis. Paralytic ileus is a common complication. Diagnostic Features Histology: Granulomas, Langhans giant cells and caseating necrosis are diagnostic. IFN- γ release assays Widal test, blood cultures positive for S. typhi. PCR assay for typhoid is also useful. X-ray may show gas under the diaphragm if perforation is present. Treatment Anti-tubercular therapy Antibiotics (e.g., cephalosporins)",

      "explanation": "Correct answer: C) Excisional biopsy Explanation: The patient’s clinical features—a 3 cm soft, non-tender swelling in the left posterior triangle of the neck without signs of inflammation, an evening rise in temperature, and weight loss —are consistent with Tuberculous Lymphadenitis. It is the commonest form of extrapulmonary tuberculosis caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis. Excisional biopsy is the most appropriate next step for definitive diagnosis and management . If the mass is still in the early stages of adenitis, an excision biopsy should be done. Incision and drainage (Option A) is incorrect because this is likely a cold abscess from tuberculous lymphadenitis. Incision and drainage can lead to chronic sinus formation and is not recommended. Fine needle aspiration cytology (Option B) is useful but not as superior as open node biopsy. False negative, false positive results and altering the node architecture, and so eventual need of open biopsy are the problems. Empiric antitubercular therapy (Option D) without a definitive diagnosis is inappropriate. Diagnosis should be confirmed before initiating treatment. Features of Tuberculous Lymphadenitis: Category Details Causative Organism Mycobacterium tuberculosis Common Sites Neck lymph nodes (80%), especially upper deep cervical (jugulodigastric - 54%) Posterior triangle lymph nodes (22%) Clinical Features Firm, matted lymph nodes Cold abscess formation Sinus formation with yellowish caseating discharge Gross Pathology Firm, matted lymph nodes with yellowish caseating material on cut section Microscopic Features Epithelioid cells with caseating material Langhans giant cells Stages 1.

      "explanation": "Correct Answer: B) Immediate surgical debridement Explanation: The patient in the scenario presents with symptoms strongly indicative of necrotizing fasciitis , a rapidly progressing and life-threatening soft tissue infection. Therefore, the most appropriate management method is immediate surgical debridement. Necrotizing fasciitis It is a severe, rapidly spreading infection that produces necrosis of the subcutaneous tissues and overlying skin associated with significant morbidity and mortality. Cause Most common: Group A β -haemolytic Streptococci. Occasionally Staphylococcus aureus. Can be polymicrobial, involving Bacteroides, Clostridium, Proteus, Pseudomonas and Klebsiella. Forms Fournier's gangrene: Affects the perineal area. Meleney's gangrene: Involves the abdominal wall. Pathology Acute inflammatory infiltrate. Extensive necrosis, edema, and thrombosis of microvasculature. Dusky blue and black skin, bullae and progress to cutaneous gangrene. Rapid spread with possible skip lesions, later coalesce. Accompanied by fever, severe toxicity, and potential renal failure due to septic shock. Predisposing Conditions Diabetes mellitus, Smoking, Penetrating trauma, Pressure sores, Immunosuppression, Intravenous drug abuse, Perineal infections, Skin damage/infection. Signs and Symptoms Local: Unusual pain, Erythema, edema, warmth, Crepitus, Blisters, bullae, Grayish drainage (dishwasher pus), Fixed staining, Necrosis, gangrene. Systemic: Fever, tachycardia, tachypnea, Shock, Coagulopathy, Multiorgan failure. Diagnosis Based on clinical presentation. Elevated creatinine kinase levels. Biopsy of fascial layers confirms diagnosis. Radiographs may show air in tissues. Management Immediate ICU admission with monitoring of volume status and cardiac function. Administer oxygen; intubate if necessary. High-dose IV penicillin G and broad-spectrum antibiotics (e.g., third-generation cephalosporins, metronidazole). Immediate, aggressive surgical excision with daily dressing changes. Multiple debridements may be needed. Large wounds may require skin grafting or flap coverage. Vacuum-assisted dressings and early skin grafting aid healing and minimize fluid loss. Hyperbaric oxygen therapy can reduce mortality. Mortality Between 30% and 50%, even with prompt operative intervention. Image Monitor and observe (Option A) are inadequate for necrotising fasciitis due to its rapid progression and high mortality rate if not treated aggressively. IV fluids and pain management (Option B) are supportive measures, but they do not address the source of the infection. Immediate surgical debridement is essential to remove necrotic tissue and halt the infection. Intravenous antibiotics (Option C) are",

      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: C) Gas Gangrene Explanation: Gas Gangrene A rapidly progressive, potentially fatal condition characterized by widespread necrosis of muscles and soft-tissue destruction, often due to late-presenting missile wounds or crushing injuries. Cause Clostridium perfringens Incubation period <24 hours but ranges from 1 hour to 6 weeks Sources and predisposing factors Contaminated soil and feces. Wounds with necrotic or foreign material. Crush wounds, road traffic accidents, amputations. Anaerobic environments in the wound. Common sites of infection Adductor region of the lower limb and buttocks. Subscapular region in the upper limb. Clinical features Severe pain with limb swelling rapidly increases in severity. Serosanguineous discharge. Skin turns brown to blue-black with hemorrhagic bullae. Sweet, sticky odor & Soft-tissue crepitus. Complication Septicaemia, toxemia, renal failure, liver failure. Circulatory failure, DIC, secondary infections. Death occurs in critically ill patients. Investigation X-ray: Gas in soft tissues. Gram stain & blood culture: Large Gram-positive bacilli without neutrophils. Biochemical profile: Metabolic acidosis, renal failure. Peripheral blood smear: Haemolysis. CT scan for chest or abdominal wounds. Treatment High-dose intravenous penicillin and clindamycin, along with 3rd generation cephalosporins, are given intravenously. Polyvalent antiserums given intravenously. All dead tissues are excised, and debridement is performed until healthy tissue bleeds. Amputation done in severe cases Hyperbaric oxygen therapy. Prevention Proper debridement of devitalized crushed wounds. Devitalized wounds should not be sutured. Adequate cleaning of wounds with H I O I and normal saline. Penicillin - As a prophylactic antibiotic. Image Hidradenitis Suppurativa (Option A): Chronic inflammatory skin condition affecting apocrine sweat glands; lacks rapid progression, gas formation, or systemic signs. Fournier’s Gangrene (Option B): Severe, rapidly progressing infection of the scrotal skin and subcutaneous tissue, leading to gangrene, but localized to the perineum and genitals. Cellulitis (Option D): Deep skin infection affecting dermis and subcutaneous tissue, presenting with swelling, redness, and warmth but without gas formation or foul odour.",
