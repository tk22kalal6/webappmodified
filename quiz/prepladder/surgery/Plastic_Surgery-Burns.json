      "question": "A 35 year old industrial worker presents to the ED with severe pain and burns on his right hand after exposure to hydrofluoric acid. The burns are superficial, with erythema and blistering. What is the most appropriate initial management step?",
      "options": {
        "A": "Immediate surgical debridement",
        "B": "Topical application of calcium gluconate gel",
        "C": "Intravenous calcium gluconate",
        "D": "Bier's block with calcium gluconate 10%"
      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: B) Topical application of calcium gluconate gel. Explanation: Hydrofluoric acid is commonly used in industrial areas. It is the strongest inorganic acid that can produce corrosion and dehydration. Though hydrofluoric acid (HF) is a weak acid, it can chelate calcium and magnesium in tissues, causing both local and systemic effects. Management: Initial Management : Applying calcium gluconate gel directly to the burn site (Option B) helps neutralize the acid and provide calcium, which counters the acid's chelating effects and prevents hypocalcemia. Immediate surgical debridement (Option A) is indicated only for burns with HF concentrations above 50% to prevent hypocalcemia and arrhythmias. IV calcium (Option C) is used if there are systemic symptoms of hypocalcemia, but it is not the first step for localized burns. Bier's block with calcium gluconate 10% (Option D) is used for severe or extensive burns, not as the initial management. Chemical burns: These injuries involve two aspects: Physical destruction of the skin. Systemic poisoning due to absorption. Initial management steps: Determine if the chemical is a solid powder or a liquid. Solid powders, such as phosphorus and elemental sodium, should be removed with forceps and not irrigated with water to prevent further reactions. Liquids can generally be washed off with water. Acids and alkalis are the most common causes of chemical burns. Alkalis are often more destructive than acids, especially dangerous to the eyes.

        "D": "Start hemodialysis immediately"
      },
      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: A) Initiate intravenous fluid resuscitation and monitor urine output Explanation : This scenario describes a patient with an electrical burn who shows signs of rhabdomyolysis, as evidenced by dark urine and extremely elevated CK levels. The elevated serum creatinine and hyperkalemia indicate that the patient is at risk of acute kidney injury (AKI) due to myoglobinuria. The first and most critical step in managing rhabdomyolysis is aggressive intravenous fluid resuscitation to ensure adequate urine output and prevent renal failure. This helps flush out myoglobin and other cellular debris from the kidneys, reducing the risk of AKI. Monitoring urine output ensures that the patient responds to the fluid therapy and aids in assessing the need for further intervention. After the patient is stabilized, immediate surgical debridement of the entry and exit wounds (Option B) can be performed. While hyperkalemia is present, the immediate priority is fluid resuscitation. Calcium gluconate (Option C) can be given if the patient shows signs of cardiac instability. Hemodialysis (Option D) is considered if the patient does not respond to initial management or has severe electrolyte abnormalities unresponsive to other treatments.",

      },
      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "prevent airway compromise. Correct Answer: A) Exposure Method – To allow continuous monitoring of facial burns and prevent airway compromise. Explanation: The exposure method is chosen in cases of facial burns because it allows healthcare providers to closely monitor the patient’s airway and facial swelling. This method ensures that any signs of airway obstruction can be addressed promptly, which is crucial for patient safety in the case of severe facial burns. Types of methods used for burns wound care: Exposure method Closed method No dressing is done. Antimicrobials are given 2-3 times/day. They are used for burns involving the face & the head. Disadvantages: Increased pain & heat loss. Increased risk of cross-contamination. Occlusive dressing is applied over the antimicrobial agent. The dressing is changed twice daily. Advantages: Decreased pain & heat loss. Decreased risk of cross-contamination. Disadvantages: Increased risk of bacterial growth if the dressing is not changed twice daily.

The ideal site is veins of the hand and antecubital fossa. Long saphenous vein is preferred in case of edema due to burns. Three main fluids are used in the resuscitation stage: Crystalloid, Colloid and Hypertonic saline. The fluid of choice in burns is Ringer lactate (Crystalloid), as it closely replicates the osmolality of plasma. The lactate content helps correct metabolic acidosis, which is common in burns patients. The maintenance fluid of choice in children with burns is DNS as children have lesser glycogen. Other fluids used are Hypertonic saline, Normal saline, and Human albumin. Hypertonic saline is used in patients with shock due to burn injury. Human albumin (Colloid) is avoided during first 24 hours of burn injury as it causes edema (Option D). Reference: Bailey & Love's Short Practice of Surgery, 28th Edition, Page 670-671.",

Danger signs include singed nasal hair, Hoarseness of voice, Carbonaceous deposits in sputum, and History of burns in a closed room. Symptoms of laryngeal oedema include voice changes, stridor, anxiety, and respiratory difficulty. Treatment involves securing the airway with an endotracheal tube until the swelling subsides (usually about 48 hours). Early intubation is preferred for suspected airway burns. Intubation can be difficult or impossible due to swelling(Laryngeal edema), so cricothyroidotomy is done. Time from burn to airway occlusion is typically 4-24 hours .

      "question": "A 55-year-old male with a history of a recent traumatic brain injury presents with sudden epigastric pain, vomiting of blood, and black stools. He is diagnosed with a Cushing ulcer. Despite initial management with IV fluids and proton pump inhibitors (PPIs), the patient continues to bleed. What is the most appropriate next step in management?",
      "options": {
        "A": "Increase the dose of IV PPIs and observe for improvement.",
        "B": "Perform an urgent endoscopy to control the bleeding.",
        "C": "Schedule the patient for a planned surgical vagotomy and pyloroplasty.",
        "D": "Refer the patient for immediate angiography with embolization."
      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: B) Perform an urgent endoscopy to control the bleeding Explanation: Urgent endoscopy is the first-line intervention for controlling gastrointestinal bleeding in patients with Cushing ulcers. It is effective even though there is a high risk of rebleeding. Cushing Ulcer Pathophysiology Cushing's ulcer is a gastro-duodenal ulcer caused by increased intracranial pressure (ICP), commonly due to brain tumors, head injuries or other intracranial conditions. Vagal Stimulation : Overstimulation of the vagus nerve due to elevated ICP leads to increased gastric acid secretion. Sympathetic Paralysis : Disruption in sympathetic pathways may exacerbate the imbalance in gastric secretions, contributing to ulcer formation. Clinical Presentation Epigastric pain Nausea and vomiting. Gastrointestinal bleeding, presenting as hematemesis (vomiting blood) or melena (black stools). Potential complications include ulcer perforation and peritonitis, which are life-threatening if untreated. Initial Management Prophylaxis may fail (Option A). Resuscitation: Begins with crystalloids and early use of balanced blood products. Coagulopathy Correction: FFP or platelet transfusions are needed for coagulopathy or antiplatelet drug use. Nasogastric Tube: Key for lavage and decompression in hemorrhagic stress gastritis. Antisecretory Agents: IV PPIs are preferred over H2 antagonists for bleeding control. Endoscopy: First-line for GI bleeding, effective despite high rebleed risk. (Option B) Angiography: For failed endoscopy, involves embolization or vasopressin infusion. (Option D) Surgical Indications For unresponsive, recurrent bleeding or perforations. Surgical Approach A staged approach starting with bleeding control is safer. Initial Surgery: Long midline incision for exploration; anterior gastrotomy to oversew bleeding sites. Stable Patients: Vagotomy and pyloroplasty after bleeding control; abdominal closure. (Option C) Unstable Patients: Leave the abdomen open for resuscitation; second surgery for vagotomy and pyloroplasty when stable. Rare Procedures: Due to the high risks, gastric resection, subtotal or total gastrectomy, and gastric devascularization are rarely performed.

      },
      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: C) All except B Explanation: PATHOPHYSIOLOGY OF BURNS Local responses: Skin Damage Burns cause cell membrane disruption and necrosis due to rapid temperature changes. The depth of injury depends on temperature, exposure duration, and thermal conductivity (e.g., oil burns are deeper than water burns). Jackson Levels Zone of Coagulation : Irreversible tissue damage with cell destruction. (Statement B) Zone of Stasis: Moderate damage with reduced perfusion; survival depends on timely intervention. Zone of Hyperemia: Vasodilation around the wound; generally remains viable and aids healing. Systemic Responses: Inflammation & Edema Burns trigger widespread inflammation, increasing vascular permeability, leading to fluid loss, edema, and decreased plasma volume. (Statement E) Cardiopulmonary Effects Microvascular changes reduce cardiac output, potentially leading to ventricular dysfunction despite fluid resuscitation. (Statement C) Renal System Decreased blood volume affects renal blood flow, risking acute tubular necrosis if not managed promptly. Immune Suppression Burns impair immune function, increasing infection risk due to compromised neutrophils, macrophages, and T lymphocytes. (Statement D) Hypermetabolism Burns induce a hypermetabolic state, leading to increased oxygen consumption, protein/fat breakdown, and muscle wasting. The liver plays a key role in gluconeogenesis and fatty acid processing. (Statement A) Ebb and Flow Phases Post-injury, the body undergoes an initial low metabolic rate (ebb phase) followed by a hypermetabolic state (flow phase). Complications: Infection : Early excision and grafting of burns are crucial to prevent infections. Organ Failure : Severe burns can lead to multiple organ failure due to a systemic inflammatory response. Reference: Bailey & Love’s Short Practice of Surgery, 28th Edition, Pages 665, 666.
