      "question": "A patient who had undergone cystectomy and urinary diversion with an ileal conduit after being diagnosed with muscle-invasive bladder cancer comes for follow-up. His blood investigations revealed an electrolyte imbalance. Which of the following is not a possible imbalance in this condition?",
      "options": {
        "A": "Hypokalemia",
        "B": "Hyponatremia",
        "C": "Hypocalcemia",
        "D": "Hypomagnesemia"
      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: B) Hyponatremia Explanation: The electrolyte imbalance that does not occur in the case of urinary diversion with an ileal conduit is hyponatremia. Sodium is absorbed via trans-cellular and paracellular routes in the ileum and the colon. In the ileum, the sodium loss is not clinically significant and hence hyponatremia does not occur. Ileum vs. Colon Absorption Ileum: Absorbs less chloride, more potassium Colon : Absorbs more chloride, less potassium. Electrolyte Imbalances in Metabolic Acidosis Hypokalemia (Option A) : Low potassium levels due to intestinal losses and renal wasting. Hypocalcemia (Option C) : Low calcium levels due to renal wasting and bone demineralization. Hypomagnesemia (Option D) : Low magnesium levels due to renal wasting. Hyperchloremic Acidosis Mechanism Ammonium Ion Dissociation : Ammonium (NH4+) dissociates into ammonia (NH3) and hydrogen ions (H+). Ammonia Handling : Ammonia enters cells, and hydrogen ions are actively absorbed in exchange for sodium Ammonium Absorption : Ammonium can enter cells via potassium channels, substituting potassium. Chloride Absorption : Balanced by the absorption of chloride, leading to hyperchloremic acidosis and bicarbonate loss. Hypocalcemia Mechanism Bone Buffering : Chronic metabolic acidosis is buffered by bone carbonate, releasing calcium from bones. Bone Demineralization : Calcium released from bone is not reabsorbed, leading to decreased body calcium stores. Renal Wasting : Increased renal loss of calcium contributes to hypocalcemia. Effects of Urinary Diversion Chronic metabolic acidosis following urinary diversion leads to continuous buffering by bone carbonate, causing bone demineralization.

      },
      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: A) Patent urachus Explanation: The scenario here points to the diagnosis of a patent urachus, and the preferred management is surgical excision. Patent urachus is the non-descent of the bladder or failure of the epithelial-lined urachal canal to obliterate. Clinical features: Continuous or intermittent drainage of fluid from the umbilicus Enlarged or edematous umbilicus Delayed healing of cord stump Investigation: The diagnosis is confirmed by demonstration of the fluid-filled canal on longitudinal ultrasound or contrast filling on retrograde fistulogram or VCUG. MRI Treatment: Surgically excised using a transverse or midline infraumbilical incision. Urachal remnants can also be removed laparoscopically. If there is an associated abscess, it has to be drained first, and antibiotic coverage should be given before surgery. Urachal cyst (Option B): There is no communication of the cyst with the bladder or umbilicus. However, the fluid-filled cyst can drain through the umbilicus or into the bladder intermittently. Seen more in adults than in children. Presents with lower abdominal pain, palpable mass over abdomen, voiding symptoms Can lead to umbilical abscess or bladder infections. Urachal sinus (Option C): This condition occurs when the patent urachus obliterates at the bladder level but remains open at the umbilicus, resulting in a continuously draining sinus. It has similar presenting features as a patent urachus but has continuous draining and is not intermittent. Urachal diverticulum (Option D): The urachus obliterates almost completely except at the bladder apex and forms a diverticulum here. It can be of different sizes. These are usually asymptomatic . Stone formation and urinary tract infection may occur.",

      "explanation": "Correct Answer: D) Previous history of tuberculosis Explanation: A history of previous tuberculosis is not an absolute contraindication for using BCG in a bladder carcinoma patient. However it may increase the risk of complications or decrease the treatment effectiveness. Administration Intravesical instillations: Administered postoperatively Induction therapy: Weekly for 6 weeks Maintenance therapy: Every 3 weeks for 3 years (variable intervals for 1-3 years) Timing BCG Therapy: Administered 6 weeks post-operatively, not immediately. (Option B) Mitomycin C: Given immediately post-operatively. Agents BCG (Bacillus Calmette-Guérin): Live attenuated vaccine. Mitomycin C: Antineoplastic agent. Mechanism of Action BCG Therapy: Elicits a massive influx of inflammatory cells and cytokines, inducing an inflammatory response against neoplastic cells. Side Effects Transient fever Frequency Dysuria Urgency BCG Cystitis BCG Sepsis Contraindications Immunocompromised Patients: (Option A) Risk of BCG sepsis; requires a competent immune system. Gross Hematuria: Risk of BCG entering circulation and causing systemic infection. Total Urinary Incontinence (Option C) : BCG is ineffective if it cannot remain in the bladder. History of Previous BCG Sepsis or Hypersensitivity: Risk of severe reactions. Other Systemic Chemotherapy Agents Used Cisplatin or gemcitabine and cisplatin.

Types of Urinary Diversion: 1. Non-Continent Urinary Diversion : Urine is diverted to an external stoma and collected in a bag outside the body. Examples: Ileal Conduit The most common type of non-continent diversion. A segment of the ileum (small intestine) is isolated and used to create a conduit for urine to flow from the ureters to an external stoma. Ureterostomy : The ureters are directly connected to the abdominal wall to create a stoma. Less commonly used, typically in situations where other options are not feasible. 2. Continent Cutaneous Urinary Diversion Urine is stored in an internal reservoir and can be emptied through a catheter inserted into a stoma. Orthotopic Neobladder: A new bladder (neobladder) is created using a segment of the intestine and connected to the urethra, allowing for normal voiding.",

        "D": "Alpha-fetoprotein"
      },
      "correct_answer": "D",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: D) Alpha-fetoprotein Explanation: Alpha-fetoprotein is not a tumor marker for urinary bladder cancer; it is primarily associated with liver cancer and germ cell tumors. Investigations for urinary bladder cancer Cystoscopy Gold standard for bladder cancer diagnosis and staging; suspicious lesions should be biopsied or resected. Urine Cytology Used as an adjunct to cystoscopy. To confirm the diagnosis - has high specificity but low sensitivity. Detects high-grade urothelial carcinoma by identifying exfoliated cancer cells. Fluorescence Cystoscopy Enhances the detection of tumors but may have a higher false-positive rate. Urinary Tract Imaging CT scan is preferred for all stages; IVP is an alternative if CT is not available but is less commonly used. Tumor Markers Helpful in diagnosis and for follow-up to assist the response of therapy and to detect recurrence NMP22 (Nuclear Matrix Protein 22) (Option B) Measures levels of a protein released from bladder cancer cells into the urine. BTA (Bladder Tumor Antigen) (Option C) Detects proteins associated with bladder cancer in the urine. Lewis X antigen Immunocytological detection of the Lewis X antigen on exfoliated bladder cells has improved the identification of urothelial tumor cells. Hyaluronidase (Option A) Elevated levels of urinary HA and HAase have been observed in patients with bladder cancer. HYAL-1 hyaluronidase is a potential prognostic marker for predicting muscle invasion and recurrence in non-muscle-invasive bladder cancer.

      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: C) T2 Explanation: T2 lesions indicate invasion into the muscle layer of the bladder. Primary Tumor Staging (TNM System) The depth of invasion of the primary tumor in bladder cancer is a crucial prognostic factor for recurrence and progression. Ta Lesions (Option A) Papillary (exophytic) tumors with a tendency to recur. Tis Lesions High-grade intraepithelial neoplasms (carcinoma in situ [CIS]) without invasion into subepithelial connective tissue. T1 Lesions (Option B) Tumors invade the submucosa or lamina propria, typically high-grade. T2 Lesions (Option C) Tumors invade muscle; cystectomy is standard therapy. Presence of muscle invasion increases the likelihood of nodal and distant metastases. T3 Lesions (Option D) Tumors extend beyond muscle into perivesical fat. Imaging (CT, MRI, PET) may help identify disease spread outside the bladder. T4 Lesions Tumors extend into adjacent organs. T4a - invasion into the prostate, vagina, uterus, or bowel T4b - tumors fixed to the abdominal wall, pelvic wall, or other organs. Regional Lymph Nodes & Distant Metastases Description N1 Involvement of a single lymph node within the true pelvis. N2 Involvement of multiple lymph nodes within the true pelvis. N3 Spread to the common iliac lymph nodes. M1a Lymph node involvement beyond the common iliac lymph nodes. M1b Involvement of distant organs (non-lymph node distant metastases).

      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: A) Congenital diverticulum due to its location and UTIs. Explanation: Bladder diverticula can be congenital or acquired (secondary to intravesical bladder outlet obstruction). Type Congenital Diverticula Acquired Diverticula Cause Develops due to herniation of bladder mucosa through congenital muscular defect between the intravesical ureter and roof of ureteral hiatus called Hutch diverticulum. Secondary to bladder outlet obstruction, often due to prostatic issues in adult men. Bladder characteristics Thin-walled, typically located near the ureteric orifice, associated with vesicoureteral reflux (VUR) (Option A) Thick-walled with trabeculations and multiple diverticula. (Option D) High intravesical pressure causes bladder mucosa to protrude, forming saccules, which can become diverticula. (Option B) Symptoms or complications Haematuria (due to infection, stone or tumor) (30%) Recurrent UTIs Bladder stones Urinary retention Hydronephrosis Bladder tumors (1%) Diagnosis Imaging (ultrasound, CT, MRI, cystogram) or cystoscopy. Confirm bladder outlet obstruction with urodynamics if suspected. Bladder diverticulum MRI: Bladder diverticulum CT: Cystogram with bladder diverticulum: Cystoscopical view of bladder diverticulum: Treatment Congenital bladder diverticula is treated if symptomatic or for suspected malignancy.

      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: B) Emergency laparotomy Explanation: In the above clinical scenario, the patient presents with signs and symptoms of intraperitoneal bladder rupture, which is a surgical emergency. Therefore, emergency laparotomy is done immediately. Intraperitoneal rupture Involves a tear or injury to the peritoneum over the bladder, and urine leaks into the peritoneal cavity in males. Causes: Often occurs in a fully distended bladder, usually due to trauma or injury. Clinical Features: Sudden, severe pain in the suprapubic region. Signs of shock and syncope. Diffuse abdominal pain with later features of peritonitis. Abdominal distension. Haematuria Absence of desire to urinate. Diagnosis: Plain X-ray: May show ground glass appearance. Peritoneal Tap: Used to collect urine from the abdominal cavity. Cystography: Iodine dye is injected via a catheter to visualize bladder tears and the dye entry into the peritoneal cavity. The contrast outlines the bowel loops. Ultrasound: To assess other abdominal injuries. Treatment: Emergency Laparotomy is required. (Option B). Bladder tear is sutured with polylactic acid (vicryl) in two layers. Peritoneal wash to clean out the peritoneal cavity. Separate drainage for prevesical space and peritoneal cavity. Administration of specific antibiotics to prevent sepsis. Catheterization: Malecot’s catheter is placed suprapubically. Foley's catheter passed urethrally. Complications: Cystitis /and pyelonephritis. Peritonitis. Pelvic abscess. Fistula formation (vesicovaginal or rectovesical). Paralytic ileus. Hemorrhage. Prognosis: 100% mortality without surgery. Foley’s catheterisation and observe ( Option A ): Foley’s catheterisation alone is insufficient for the treatment of intraperitoneal ruptures due to the risk of peritonitis and sepsis. IV antibiotic and close monitoring ( Option C ): While antibiotics are part of the management, they alone are insufficient to treat intraperitoneal bladder rupture. The patient requires surgical repair to prevent severe complications. Delayed surgical repair ( Option D ): It can lead to worsening infection, abdominal sepsis, and increased mortality.

      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: C) Interstitial Cystitis with Hunner's Lesion Explanation: Interstitial Cystitis is a chronic bladder condition characterized by pelvic pain, urinary urgency, frequency, and a hallmark cystoscopic finding of Hunner’s lesions . These are inflamed, ulcerative lesions on the bladder wall that are pathognomonic for this condition. They often present with reduced bladder capacity and mucosal breaks, distinguishing them from other forms of cystitis and bladder pathologies. Features of Interstitial Cystitis Feature Description Cystoscopic Findings Hunner’s lesions (ulcerative lesions), small bladder capacity, and mucosal breaks Symptoms Chronic pelvic pain, urinary urgency, frequency, nocturia Etiology Uncertain, though associated with autoimmune, neurogenic, and allergic etiologies Differential Diagnosis Bladder cancer, UTI, Radiation cystitis, Endometriosis Treatment Behavioral therapy Pharmacotherapy (e.g., pentosan polysulfate sodium) Intravesical therapies (e.g., GAG layer replacement therapies, dimethyl sulfoxide) Surgical interventions (e.g., Fulguration or laser therapy for Hunner lesions, cystectomy in severe cases) Bladder cancer (Option A) might present with similar symptoms, such as hematuria and pelvic pain, but it is typically identified on cystoscopy by the presence of a mass or irregular growth rather than mucosal breaks and inflammation seen in interstitial cystitis with Hunner's lesions. Radiation cystitis (Option B) is a condition seen post-radiation therapy, characterized by a contracted bladder, vascular changes, and sometimes hematuria. While it can cause chronic bladder symptoms, it does not present with Hunner lesions on cystoscopy. UTI (Option D) is commonly associated with dysuria, frequency, and urgency but lacks the chronicity and cystoscopic findings of Hunner lesions. UTIs are typically associated with bacterial growth, which is not a feature of interstitial cystitis.",

      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: A) Commonly associated with Gram-negative bacteria like E. coli Explanation: Malakoplakia is a rare inflammatory condition often seen in immunocompromised patients , such as those with chronic immunosuppression following organ transplants. It is commonly associated with Gram-negative bacteria, particularly Escherichia coli . The histological hallmark of malakoplakia is the presence of von Hansemann cells (large, foamy histiocytes) and Michaelis-Gutmann bodies ( PAS-positive , basophilic intracytoplasmic inclusions that also stain with von Kossa and Perl’s stains ). Michaelis-Gutmann bodies: Malakoplakia Common Pathogen Escherichia coli (most common), other Gram-negative bacteria Histopathology Von Hansemann cells (foamy histiocytes) with Michaelis-Gutmann bodies (PAS-positive inclusions) Characteristic Inclusions Michaelis-Gutmann bodies, which are basophilic intracytoplasmic inclusions Staining Positive staining with periodic acid-Schiff (PAS), von Kossa, and Perl’s stains Associated Conditions Immunocompromised states, such as organ transplantation, HIV, diabetes, malignancy Organ Involvement Predominantly genitourinary tract, but can affect multiple organ systems Treatment Antibiotics (fluoroquinolones, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole), possible surgical excision Prognosis Requires treatment; may lead to complications if untreated; variable course with potential relapses Langhans giant cells (Option B) are associated with granulomatous diseases like tuberculosis and sarcoidosis, not malakoplakia. The characteristic cells in malakoplakia are von Hansemann cells with Michaelis-Gutmann bodies. High-dose corticosteroids (Option C) are not the primary treatment for malakoplakia. Instead, the condition is treated with antibiotics that optimize intracellular killing of bacteria (e.g., fluoroquinolones, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole), and surgical excision may be considered in certain cases. Malakoplakia is not typically self-limiting and usually requires treatment with antibiotics (Option D). Without appropriate intervention, it can lead to significant complications, especially in immunocompromised patients.",

      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: C) Increased risk of urinary bladder adenocarcinoma Explanation: Ectopia vesicae, also known as bladder exstrophy, is associated with an increased risk of developing urinary bladder adenocarcinoma due to chronic irritation and exposure of the bladder's internal lining. Ectopia vesicae : It is a rare congenital defect where the urinary bladder is exposed outside the abdomen due to a failure to develop the lower abdominal wall. M/c in males. (Option A ruled out) Clinical Feature Description Visible Bladder Exposure The bladder mucosa is exposed on the lower abdomen, typically above the pubic symphysis, and can range from the exposed trigone to the entire bladder. Genital Abnormalities Males: Epispadias (urethra opens on the dorsal side of the penis), short and broad penis, upward curvature Females : Bifid clitoris, separation of the labia minora, abnormal vaginal opening Abdominal Wall Defect Absence of lower abdominal wall muscles, widened pubic symphysis, diastasis of rectus muscles Outward rotation of pelvic bones Higher incidence of indirect inguinal hernia Urological Continuous leakage of urine due to the inability to close the bladder outlet.

        "D": "Overactive Bladder"
      },
      "correct_answer": "D",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: D) Overactive Bladder Explanation: Overactive Bladder is associated with frequent urination and urgency, not with chronic urinary retention. The other conditions listed - Parkinson's disease, diabetic neuropathy, and BPH can directly lead to chronic urinary retention due to their impact on bladder function or outlet obstruction. Chronic Urinary Retention Painless inability to fully empty the bladder, leading to elevated post-void residual volume. Primary Cause Bladder outlet obstruction (BOO) Causes and Contributing Factors Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia (BPH) Bladder Neck Stenosis Detrusor underactivity Neurological Conditions: Disorders like Parkinson's, Alzheimer's, stroke, and MS affect bladder control. Diabetic neuropathy Medications: Drugs such as anticholinergics and β 3-agonists impact bladder muscle function. Urethral Stricture Complications Hydronephrosis Urinary Tract Infections (UTIs) Bladder Stones Bladder Damage : Persistent overstretching weakens the bladder muscle. Kidney Damage Overflow Incontinence Treatment Treatment is based on the underlying cause, which may include addressing bladder outlet obstruction, managing detrusor underactivity, and treating other contributing factors. Urgent catheterization is required for patients with chronic retention and renal impairment to facilitate renal function recovery, with the possibility of postobstructive diuresis. Acute Urinary Retention Painful, sudden inability to urinate despite a full bladder. Causes Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia (BPH) : Leading cause, especially in men with a history of chronic retention. Medications : Drugs like sympathomimetics, anesthetics, and opioids can impair bladder function. Neurological Conditions : acute events like stroke or spinal cord injury Urethral Stricture Blood Clots Fecal Impaction from chronic constipation Treatment Catheterization : Immediate bladder drainage for acute retention. Postobstructive diuresis: Patients may experience a high urine output after catheterization, requiring careful fluid management and electrolyte monitoring Parkinson’s disease (Option A) can cause chronic urinary retention due to impaired bladder control from neurological dysfunction. Diabetic neuropathy (Option B) can affect the nerves controlling the bladder, leading to underactive bladder and retention. Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia (BPH) (Option C) is a common cause of bladder outlet obstruction, resulting in chronic urinary retention.
