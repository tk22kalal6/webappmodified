      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "access establishment Correct answer: B) Assessment of airway, breathing, and circulation (ABCs) with intravenous access establishment Explanation: The primary step in managing acute UGIB is to ensure the patient’s airway, breathing, and circulation (ABCs) are stable and establish intravenous access for fluid resuscitation. Management of acute UGI bleed Initial Stabilization and Resuscitation Prioritise assessment of airway, breathing, and circulation (ABCs). Establish intravenous access with two large-bore catheters for fluid resuscitation. Risk Stratification Use the Glasgow-Blatchford Score (GBS) for early risk assessment. Patients with a GBS of 0 are low-risk and may not need hospital admission. Blood Transfusion Strategy Adopt a restrictive transfusion strategy, aiming for a haemoglobin level of 70–90 g/L. Consider a more liberal transfusion approach only in cases of massive blood loss. Pharmacotherapy In suspected variceal bleeding, administer intravenous terlipressin to improve outcomes and reduce the need for additional interventions. Role of Endoscopy Perform endoscopy urgently in unstable patients and within 24 hours for others. Endoscopy serves to: Identify the bleeding source. Assess prognosis using criteria like the Forrest classification. Treat with techniques such as: Injection therapy: Adrenaline injection. Thermal coagulation: Using heat probes or electrocoagulation. Mechanical methods: Endoscopic clips to close bleeding sites. Alternative Interventions If endoscopy fails or bleeding recurs, consider interventional radiology or surgery. Post-Endoscopy Management High-risk patients should receive intravenous proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) for 72 hours, followed by twice-daily oral PPI for 11 days. Address underlying conditions, including the eradication of H. pylori if present, to prevent rebleeding. Immediate endoscopy to identify the bleeding source (Option A): Endoscopy is essential but should follow initial resuscitation and stabilisation of the patient. Administration of terlipressin for suspected variceal bleeding (Option C): Although terlipressin may be used in suspected variceal bleeding, this would follow after initial assessment and stabilisation. Blood transfusion to raise haemoglobin above 10 g/dL (Option D): A restrictive transfusion strategy is preferred, with a target haemoglobin between 7–9 g/dL",

        "D": "Ulceration of the gastric mucosa due to chronic use of NSAIDs"
      },
      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: C) Erosion of mucosa due to pulsations from a large submucosal artery Explanation: Dieulafoy’s lesion involves a large, tortuous artery in the submucosa that causes erosion of the overlying mucosa due to its pulsations, leading to bleeding. Dieulafoy’s lesion Dieulafoy's lesion is characterized by an abnormally large, tortuous artery that runs through the submucosa of the stomach without a primary ulcer. Artery measures 1-3 mm and is typically found near the gastroesophageal junction along the lesser curvature. The lesion develops as the pulsations of the large submucosal artery erode the superficial mucosa. (Option C) The mucosal defect is usually small, measuring 2-5 mm, and is surrounded by normal-appearing gastric mucosa. Once the artery is exposed to gastric contents, further erosion and bleeding occur. Demographics More common in men (2:1 ratio) and is associated with cardiovascular disease, chronic kidney disease, and diabetes. Clinical Presentation Sudden onset of massive, painless hematemesis (vomiting blood). Diagnosis Endoscopy: Primary tool, identifies lesion in 80% of cases; repeat may be needed. Angiography: Used if endoscopy is inconclusive; shows tortuous artery and potential contrast extravasation. Treatment Endoscopic Therapy: Bipolar electrocoagulation, Heater probe thermocoagulation, Injection sclerotherapy, Endoscopic hemoclipping. Angiographic Embolization: Used when endoscopy fails. Surgery: Wedge resection of the stomach if other methods fail; intraoperative endoscopy or tattooing aids in locating the lesion. Erosion of the mucosa due to excessive acid secretion (Option A) describes conditions like peptic ulcers. Rupture of varices caused by portal hypertension (Option B) is associated with portal hypertensive gastropathy or oesophagal varices. Ulceration of the gastric mucosa due to chronic use of NSAIDs (Option D) is related to NSAID-induced ulcers.",

      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: B) Endoscopy with biopsy Explanation: In the case of a gastric ulcer, an endoscopy with multiple biopsies must be performed at any cost in order to rule out gastric carcinoma. Clinical features: Pain in epigastrium that worsens with food Vomiting Anorexia due to pain on eating Weight loss Hematemesis Investigations : Endoscopy and biopsy : This is done because gastric carcinoma and gastric ulcer appear very similar, and the only way to differentiate them correctly is by biopsy and histopathological examination. Even if the first biopsy shows no signs of carcinoma, multiple biopsies must be done to rule it out confidently. Once it is ruled out, PPIs and H-pylori eradication medications can be advised in an uncomplicated case. The ‘U’ manoeuvre should be carried out to inspect the incisura, lesser curve, and gastro-oesophageal junction (GOJ), given the increasing incidence of cancer at the GOJ. Hence, the U and J manoeuvres are done to visualize the fundus and the GOJ. H pylori assessment (Option C) is also done but is not as important as the endoscopy and biopsy. Management : Proton Pump Inhibitors are the most effective for gastric ulcers. Type I (ulcer at incisura): Distal Gastrectomy/ Antrectomy Type II(two ulcers) and III (pre-pyloric ulcer): Truncal vagotomy with antrectomy Type IV (ulcer at the higher location of lesser curvature) (Special surgeries) Csendes Pouchet Kelling- Madlener Shoe-Maker Type V (NSAID induced): Stop NSAIDs Complications: Bleeding Perforation Stenosis Severe vomiting leads to dehydration and electrolyte imbalance Malnutrition due to anorexia Ulcer transforming into carcinoma Ultrasonography (Option D) has no significant role in diagnosing peptic ulcers.

      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: C) Placement of a nasogastric tube and correction of fluid/electrolyte imbalances relieve pressure and correct any fluid and electrolyte imbalances caused by vomiting. Most Common Causes of GOO: Gastric Cancer Pyloric Stenosis from Peptic Ulceration Other causes: Peptic ulcers used to significantly contribute to GOO and were managed surgically, though these procedures are now rarely needed. Gastric Outlet Obstruction (GOO) from Peptic Ulcer Disease (PUD) GOO occurs when the passage of food from the stomach to the small intestine is blocked. Inflammation and scarring from ulcers in the pylorus or duodenum, lead to a narrowing of the digestive tract. Symptoms Early satiety, Anorexia, Weight loss, Feeling of fullness Nausea and vomiting, Abdominal pain, Dilated stomach, Dehydration and metabolic alkalosis (from prolonged vomiting) Diagnosis Primary Diagnostic Approach : Differentiate PUD vs malignancy. Endoscopy: Directly visualizes the pylorus to evaluate stenosis and obtain biopsies to rule out cancer. Assess for H. pylori infection. (Option D) Contrast Radiology: Assesses pylorus narrowing and obstruction severity Treatment Initial Stabilization : (Option C) Gastric Decompression: NG tube placement. Fluid and Electrolyte Correction: Intravenous fluids and electrolytes. Nutritional Support: Dietary modifications, enteral or parenteral nutrition. Addressing Underlying PUD : Medical Therapy: H. pylori eradication therapy, Proton pump inhibitors (PPIs). Endoscopic Dilation: Dilate narrowed tract area; stent placement (Option B) .

      "correct_answer": "D",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: D) Balloon tamponade Explanation: Balloon tamponade is not a management option for Mallory-Weiss syndrome . It is primarily used for controlling bleeding from oesophagal varices, not for mucosal lacerations like those seen in Mallory-Weiss tears. Mallory-Weiss Tears: Mucosal lacerations in the gastric mucosa at the gastroesophageal (GE) junction are caused by forceful vomiting, retching, coughing, or straining. Epidemiology Account for 10-15% of acute upper gastrointestinal haemorrhages. The greatest risk for massive haemorrhage is alcoholic patients with preexisting portal hypertension. Risk Factors Forceful abdominal contractions against a closed cardia. Alcoholic patients with intense vomiting after binge drinking. Any patient with repeated episodes of emesis. Portal hypertension in alcoholic patients. Diagnosis Patient history is crucial. Confirmed with endoscopy. Retroflexion manoeuvre during endoscopy to view the area below the gastroesophageal junction.

It is often seen alongside calcified aortic stenosis. Treating and correcting aortic stenosis often stops bleeding associated with angiodysplasia. This combined condition is called Heyde's syndrome. Cause Description Peptic Ulcers (Option A) Bleeding from peptic ulcers in the stomach or duodenum is a common cause of upper GI bleeding. MC artery involved in Duodenal ulcer - Gastroduodenal artery Gastric ulcer - Left gastric artery Acute Erosive Gastritis Inflammation and erosion of the stomach lining, are often caused by alcohol, NSAIDs, and stress, leading to bleeding. Oesophagitis One of the most common aetiology for UGI. It refers to inflammation or injury to the oesophageal mucosa. It can be reflux oesophagitis, infection oesophagitis, pill-induced ( alendronate, tetracycline, doxycycline, NSAIDs, aspirin), eosinophilic oesophagitis and radiation-induced oesophagitis. Mallory-Weiss Syndrome (Option C) Tears in the mucosa of the esophagus or stomach, are typically caused by severe vomiting, resulting in significant bleeding. Esophageal Varices (Option B) Enlarged veins in the oesophagus that can rupture and bleed, are commonly a complication of chronic liver disease. Primarily due to Portal Hypertension. Gastric Cancer Tumours in the stomach can cause bleeding, often microscopic, leading to anaemia. Gastric Polyps Benign growths in the stomach lining can be a source of bleeding. Dieulafoy's Disease A rare condition with an abnormally large artery in the stomach wall that can cause significant bleeding if the artery erodes. Gastric Antral Vascular Ectasia (GAVE) Dilated blood vessels in the stomach lining that can bleed, are often seen in individuals with liver disease or autoimmune disorders. Bleeding Disorders Conditions affecting blood clotting that can contribute to upper GI bleeding. Medications Long-term use of aspirin, NSAIDs, and corticosteroids increases the risk of ulcers and bleeding. Zollinger-Ellison Syndrome A rare disorder causing excessive stomach acid production, leading to severe peptic ulcers that are prone to bleeding.

It terminates at the incisura angularis, where it fans out in a distinctive \"crow’s foot\" pattern. The nerve supply of the stomach: Lymph nodes here drain exclusively into the pancreaticolienal group (Option C): The lymphatic drainage of this area is not exclusive to the pancreaticolienal group. The supra pyloric group of nodes drains the antral segment on the lesser curvature of the stomach into the right supra pancreatic nodes. The inferior gastric and sub-pyloric group of nodes drains lymph along the right gastroepiploic vascular pedicle. All four lymph node zones drain into the celiac nodes and eventually into the thoracic duct.

      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: A) Perforated duodenal ulcer Explanation: The clinical scenario here points to the diagnosis of a perforated duodenal ulcer leading to air under the diaphragm . Complications of duodenal ulcer: 1) Duodenal ulcer perforation: Common with anterior duodenal ulcers. Presents with an acute abdomen with sudden-onset, severe epigastric pain, rebound tenderness, and air under the diaphragm in the radiograph. Management: Non-surgical: Nil per-oral IV antibiotics and PPIs Surgical: Initial empirical antibiotic treatment. The perforation is approached by a small upper midline incision Perforations <1cm are closed primarily and buttressed with a well-vascularized omentum Larger perforations & with fibrotic edges: Modified Graham's Repair or Omental Patch Repair. The vascularized pedicle of the greater omentum is patched over the defect. 2) Bleeding duodenal ulcer: A posterior duodenal ulcer is the one that usually bleeds. It is due to the involvement of the gastroduodenal artery . This leads to hematemesis, melena or both i.e., an upper GI bleed. Bleeding is commonly associated with intake of NSAIDs . Management: Endoscopic: Done to find the bleeding source and manage bleeds endoscopically. Injection , thermal coagulation, plasma argon coagulation, mechanical clips, and fibrin glue are the methods used. (with or without adrenaline injection). Angiographic management: If endoscopic management fails. Surgical management: Exposure of the ulcer and ligation of the duodenum is the principle here. Duodenotomy Ligation of the bleeding vessel with truncal vagotomy with pyloroplasty 3) Gastric Outlet Obstruction (GOO) (Option C) Acute inflammation of the duodenum or pylorus leads to mechanical obstruction with a functional gastric outlet obstruction. Presents with nausea, early satiety, vomiting, loss of weight, and anorexia. 4) Hourglass deformity (Option D) is seen in chronic gastric ulcers with scarring and fibrosis. 5) Pyloric stenosis (Option B) is also seen in cases of chronic ulcers, which lead to stricture and constriction of the pylorus.",

      "question": "A 35-year-old man comes to the clinic with pain in the epigastrium and uneasiness for 2 months, which is temporarily relieved by antacids. He has a history of smoking and takes nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) occasionally for back pain. An upper gastrointestinal endoscopy reveals a duodenal ulcer. What would be the best line of treatment in this case?",
      "options": {
        "A": "H. pylori eradication",
        "B": "Proton pump inhibitors",
        "C": "Antacids like aluminium hydroxide",
        "D": "Highly selective vagotomy"
      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: B) Proton pump inhibitors Explanation: The cause of duodenal ulcers in this scenario is the repeated intake of NSAIDs . Smoking also contributes as a risk factor. Here, the best line of management would be proton pump inhibitors, as they provide rapid symptomatic relief and also provide an achlorhydric state, helping the ulcer heal faster. Duodenal ulcers are focal defects in the duodenal mucosa that extend into the submucosa or deeper. M/c site is the first part of duodenum. Aetiology : H-pylori infection NSAID use Clinical features: Epigastric pain: 2-3 hours after a meal and at night Nausea Bloating Weight loss Stool positive for occult blood Anemia Management of duodenal ulcer: PPIs: Proton pump inhibitors work by providing an achlorhydric state . When there is no acid, the ulcer heals. They give quick symptomatic relief and are very useful for superficial ulcers. For chronic ulcers, these need to be given for a longer period. However, once the PPIs are stopped, relapse is almost universal. H-pylori eradication : Very advantageous treatment for duodenal ulcers as 90- 95% are found to be associated with H-pylori infection. Once the eradication is given, recurrence is very rare in adults. This is not useful in cases of other causes of peptic ulcer like Zollinger- Ellison syndrome, NSAID-associated ulcer, etc. (Option A) Surgical treatment: Choice for chronic ulcers and if complications develop. It can also be a choice in cases like Zollinger-Ellison syndrome(gastrinoma). Surgery for duodenal ulcers mainly focuses on reducing the acid flow to the duodenum. HSV (Highly Selective Vagotomy) is performed for chronic duodenal ulcers. (Option D) Gastrectomy-based procedures are also done. Surgical measures are needed less often now due to the inclusion of PPIs and H. pylori eradication medications. Antacids like aluminium hydroxide (Option C): Antacids are not used for the management of duodenal ulcers due to their lower efficacy compared to H2 receptor antagonists or PPIs.

      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: B) Dumping syndrome Explanation: The patient's symptoms, along with a history of partial gastrectomy and Billroth II reconstruction, are most consistent with dumping syndrome. It is a group of symptoms due to the accelerated emptying or dumping of hyperosmolar content into the proximal part of the small intestine. Dumping syndrome is a combination of both gastrointestinal and vasomotor symptoms due to rapid postprandial gastric emptying. It's more commonly seen in Billroth II type surgery. Clinical features : GI symptoms : Abdominal pain, early satiety, nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea, bloating Vasomotor systemic symptoms: Diaphoresis, tachycardia, palpitations, headache, syncope Early Dumping Late Dumping It is seen within 30 minutes of meals Worsens with food intake Relieved by lying down It is seen after 1-3 hours of meals Less common Worsens with exercise Relieved by food Treatment: Intravenous fluids Treatment: Oral glucose is given Prevention of dumping syndrome Dietary modification: Small frequent meals Low carbohydrate, high fat, high protein diet High fibre diet Separate intake of liquids and solids during meals If the patient is not improving after dietary modification, Tincture of opium or imodium for diarrhoea Meclizine for nausea Anticholinergics for spasms and slow gastric emptying Octreotide intake (Somatostatin analogue) - inhibits gastric emptying and affects the motility of the intestine, prolonging the intestinal transit of food. If the patient does not improve with medical management, surgery should be considered if feasible. Surgical options include, Pyloric reconstruction In patients with a prior distal gastrectomy, converting a loop gastrojejunostomy to a Roux-en-Y reconstruction is recommended. Convert Billroth-II to Billroth-I The interposition of an anti-peristaltic segment of jejunum Recurrence of gastric carcinoma (Option A) does not present this way. Gastric ulcer Type V (Option C) is associated with NSAIDs and has no relation with gastric surgeries. Irritable bowel syndrome (Option D) is a functional gastrointestinal disorder and has similar symptoms but has no relation to the surgery.",

      },
      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: A) Gastrocolic fistula Explanation: Gastric surgery can lead to various physiological disruptions due to the loss of stomach reservoir function, disruption of the pyloric sphincter mechanism, and transection of the vagus nerve. These gastrointestinal and cardiovascular symptoms can give rise to a group of conditions known as postgastrectomy syndromes. The patient's symptoms of severe diarrhoea following meals, foul breath, and significant weight loss align with a gastrocolic fistula, where an anastomotic ulcer in the gastrojejunostomy penetrates the transverse colon. This condition results in jejunal contamination with colonic bacteria, leading to severe diarrhoea and nutritional disturbances. Imaging techniques like CT with oral contrast or a barium enema can confirm this diagnosis.
