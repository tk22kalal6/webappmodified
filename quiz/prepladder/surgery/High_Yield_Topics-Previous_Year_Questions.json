      "question": "Which of the following statements is not true regarding deep vein thrombosis (DVT)?",
      "options": {
        "A": "Clinical assessment is unreliable",
        "B": "Mostly bilateral",
        "C": "Most common clinical presentation is pain and tenderness in calf",
        "D": "Some cases may directly present as pulmonary thromboembolism"
      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "blood clots in the deep veins, usually in the legs. While DVT can occur bilaterally (affecting both legs), it is not mostly bilateral. In fact, unilateral DVT (affecting only one leg) is more common than bilateral DVT. Option A Clinical assessment is unreliable: This statement is true. Clinical assessment alone is not sufficient to definitively diagnose or rule out DVT. While clinical assessment, including symptoms and physical examination findings, can raise suspicion for DVT, imaging tests such as ultrasound or venography are needed for a confirmed diagnosis. Option C Most common clinical presentation is pain and tenderness in calf: This statement is true. Pain and tenderness in the calf muscle is a common clinical presentation of DVT. Other common symptoms include swelling, redness, warmth, and dilated superficial veins in the affected leg. Option D Some cases may directly present as pulmonary thromboembolism: This statement is true. In some cases, a deep vein thrombus can break loose from its original location and travel through the bloodstream to the lungs, causing a blockage known as pulmonary thromboembolism (PTE). PTE can be a life-threatening condition and is considered a complication of DVT.",

      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "describe the clinical presentation and severity of chronic venous disorders. In this case, the presence of dilated, tortuous veins in the foot with a diameter of 4 mm indicates the presence of varicose veins, which falls under the clinical classification of C2. Incorrect Options: Option A C0: C0: No visible or palpable signs of venous disease. Option C C2: C2: Varicose veins are present. Option D C3: C3: Edema or swelling of the lower extremities is present.",
