      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: C) Pneumothorax Explanation: The procedure shown in the image is central line placement. A potential complication of this procedure is pneumothorax , which occurs when air enters the pleural space, leading to the partial or complete collapse of the lung. This can happen when the central line needle or catheter is inserted into the subclavian or jugular veins. The central venous catheter is used for fluid, medication, and nutrition administration. The tip is located in the superior vena cava. Order of preference: Subclavian vein > Internal jugular vein > Femoral vein Inside OT: Internal jugular vein Outside OT: Subclavian vein. Complications: Catheter-related sepsis, pneumothorax. Incorrect Options: Aspiration (Option A) involves inhaling stomach contents or foreign material into the lungs. Although it can occur in various clinical situations, it is not typically associated with central line placement. Torticollis (Option B) , or wry neck, is a condition where the neck muscles involuntarily contract, causing the neck to twist to one side. This is not a complication directly related to central line placement. Recurrent laryngeal nerve paralysis (Option D) is a complication typically associated with surgeries or procedures involving the neck or chest, such as thyroid or thoracic surgery. It is not commonly linked to central line placement.",

      },
      "correct_answer": "D",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: D) Hypernatremia Explanation: Hypernatremia is not typically a complication of blood transfusion. Complications of massive blood transfusion: Hypocalcemia : (Option A) Packed red blood cells (PRBCs) and other blood products are preserved with citrate , an anticoagulant. Citrate binds to ionised calcium (Ca² I ) in the recipient's blood, reducing the free calcium level - hypocalcemia. Presents as muscle spasms, cardiac arrhythmias, and decreased myocardial contractility. Metabolic Alkalosis : Citrate is metabolised in the liver to bicarbonate (HCO II ) . Rapid transfusion of citrate-containing blood products can overwhelm the liver’s ability to metabolise citrate, leading to an increase in bicarbonate levels. This results in metabolic alkalosis Hyperkalemia : Stored blood undergoes hemolysis over time, releasing potassium from red blood cells into the plasma. Transfusion of large volumes of stored blood can introduce a significant potassium load, causing hyperkalemia . Presents with cardiac arrhythmias, especially in patients with pre-existing kidney dysfunction. Hypothermia : (Option C) Rapid transfusion of cold-stored blood products (typically kept at 1–6°C) can lower the patient’s core body temperature. Coagulopathy : Massive transfusion dilutes clotting factors and platelets, leading to dilutional coagulopathy . Hypothermia and hypocalcemia exacerbate this by impairing the function of coagulation enzymes and platelets. Hypokalemia : (Option B) Post-transfusion, potassium that had leaked out of stored red blood cells can re-enter the cells in vivo. This shift can lead to hypokalemia , especially if the patient has a strong cellular uptake of potassium. Reference: Harmening, D. M. (2012).

      "correct_answer": "D",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: D) 50,000 (10^9/L) Explanation: A platelet count of at least 50,000 (10^9/L) is generally considered the minimum for performing most surgical procedures safely, as it helps minimise the risk of bleeding. National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) Guidelines (2015): For invasive procedures or surgery: Platelet counts should be increased above 50,000/ µ L. For patients at high risk of bleeding: A platelet count of 50,000-75,000/ µ L is considered appropriate. For surgery at critical sites: A platelet count of > 100,000/ µ L is recommended.

      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: C) Intraosseous route access for giving IV fluids Explanation: The image likely depicts a procedure for establishing an intraosseous route to administer IV fluids. This technique is commonly used when IV access is difficult or not possible. Intraosseous infusion (IO) involves injecting drugs, fluids, or blood products directly into the medullary cavity of the bone, providing a non-collapsible entry point into the systemic venous system. IO route is an alternative to the IV route in the transfusion of fluids in shock. The marrow of long bones has a rich network of vessels that drain into the central venous canal, emissary veins, and ultimately to central circulation. So, bone marrow functions as a non-collapsible venous access route. Intraosseous cannulation: Intraosseous cannulation is a widely accepted technique for both children and adults. The EZ-IO® system is commonly used in the UK. A hand-held electric drill is used to insert a cannula through the tibia or humeral head into the marrow cavity. The response time for drug administration is similar to intravenous (IV) access. Entire resuscitations , including anaesthetic drugs and fluids, can be performed through intraosseous cannulae. Due to resistance to flow , fluids should be given as boluses using a 50 mL syringe . Reference: Apley and Solomon’s System of Orthopaedics and Trauma, 10th Edition, Page 682",

      },
      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: C) Keloid Explanation: The lesion described is most consistent with a keloid that is characterised by the excessive growth of scar tissue beyond the boundaries of the original injury, and it often develops after trauma or surgery. They are known for being raised, thick, and sometimes itchy. Hypertrophic scar: (Option B) Confined to the original wound boundaries , unlike keloids that extend beyond the wound area. Raised scar with excess collagen. It grows rapidly and contains myofibroblasts. It tends to regress over time (months) and recur less compared to keloid Keloid: Scar grows beyond the original wound boundaries and doesn’t regress. More common among African Americans. Develops after deep dermal injuries. Hemangiomas (Option A) are benign tumours of blood vessels, usually present at birth or appearing in early childhood. They do not develop as a result of trauma. Hypertrophic scar : Similar to a keloid, a hypertrophic scar is the result of an overactive healing process. However, unlike keloids, hypertrophic scars do not extend beyond the original wound boundaries. Neurofibromas (Option D) are benign nerve sheath tumours, commonly associated with genetic conditions like neurofibromatosis rather than trauma.",

      },
      "correct_answer": "D",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: D) SBP, RR, and GCS score Explanation: The qSOFA score includes three components: Systolic Blood Pressure (SBP) less than 100 mmHg, Respiratory Rate (RR) greater than or equal to 22 breaths per minute, and a Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score. These components help in the assessment of organ failure and sepsis prognosis. Sepsis & q SOFA: Sepsis is now defined as an increase of 2 or more points in the Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score from baseline. However, calculating the full SOFA score can be complex and requires lab results, so a simpler tool, the quick SOFA (qSOFA) score, was introduced for bedside use. qSOFA Criteria: qSOFA involves evaluating three key signs: Respiratory rate ≥ 22 breaths per minute Altered mental status (GCS score) Systolic blood pressure ≤ 100 mmHg (hypotension) If a patient meets at least 2 of the 3 qSOFA criteria and is at risk for sepsis (e.g., has an infection), further evaluation should be conducted to identify the source of infection and initiate appropriate treatment.

      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "Correct ANswer: A) eFAST Explanation: In the scenario of an RTA with a stable patient, normal vitals, and clear lung fields, the most appropriate next step would be an extended Focused Assessment with Sonography in Trauma (eFAST) . It is a rapid bedside ultrasound to detect life-threatening injuries in trauma patients, focusing on the chest and abdomen. It assesses the pericardium, pleural spaces, and abdominal cavity for air or fluid. If clear lung fields rule out pneumothorax or hemothorax, eFAST helps detect other bleeding sources, like intraperitoneal bleeding. FAST (Focused Abdominal Sonography for Trauma) and eFAST (Extended FAST) Purpose : Assess for free fluid in the abdominal cavity, thoracic cavities, and pericardium. (Option A) Nature of Injury : Not used to determine the specific nature or extent of injury. Advantages : (Option A) Rapid, reproducible, portable, and non-invasive bedside test. Can be performed simultaneously with resuscitation. Accurate at detecting >100 mL of free blood. Limitations : Operator-dependent and may be unreliable in obese patients or when the bowel is full of gas. Low sensitivity (29–35%) for detecting hollow viscus or solid organ injuries without haemoperitoneum. Unreliable for excluding injuries in penetrating trauma. Requires repeat or supplementary investigations if needed. Unreliable for assessing retroperitoneum. Tube thoracostomy (Option B) is used for pneumothorax or hemothorax, but since the chest radiography shows clear lung fields, it’s not needed at this point. CECT chest (Option C) and abdomen (Option D) are more invasive imaging options. Since the chest radiography is clear and the patient is stable, eFAST is a quicker, non-invasive first step to assess for other injuries, such as abdominal or retroperitoneal bleeding, before considering further imaging.",

      "explanation": "Correct Answer: A) Reduced tissue perfusion Explanation: Reduced tissue perfusion, a hallmark of all Shock types, results in inadequate oxygen and nutrient delivery, leading to organ dysfunction. It is defined as a systemic state of low tissue perfusion which is inadequate for normal cellular respiration. (Option A) Classification Type of Shock Mechanism Examples Hypovolemic Shock Reduced circulating blood volume Hemorrhage, Dehydration Cardiogenic Shock Failure of the cardiac pump Myocardial Infarction, Cardiac Dysrhythmias Obstructive Shock Mechanical obstruction of cardiac filling Cardiac Tamponade, Tension Pneumothorax Distributive Shock Systemic vasodilation leading to organ hypoperfusion Septic Shock, Anaphylactic Shock Endocrine Shock Combination of hypovolemic, cardiogenic, or distributive shock mechanisms Addisonian Crisis, Myxedema Coma Increased peripheral resistance (Option B) may occur in some shock types (e.g., hypovolemic, cardiogenic) as compensation to maintain blood pressure, but it's not universal. In septic shock, peripheral resistance is often decreased due to vasodilation. Decreased respiratory rate (Option C) may occur in certain shock types (e.g., neurogenic, severe hypovolemic), but increased respiratory rate (tachypnea) is more common as the body compensates for low oxygen levels, making it not universal in all shock types. Cold clammy skin (Option D) occurs in some shock types (e.g., hypovolemic, cardiogenic) due to vasoconstriction, but not in all. In septic shock, skin may be warm and flushed due to vasodilation.

      "explanation": "hair before surgery to avoid surgical site infection are on the OT table with electric hair clippers. This method is preferred over the other options because it is considered to be the safest and most effective method for hair removal. Electric clippers are less likely to cause nicks, cuts, or skin irritation than a razor or hair removal cream. Moreover, electric clippers are designed to cut the hair close to the skin without causing any damage to the skin itself. Incorrect Options: Option B: Removing hair with a razor 24 hours before surgery is not recommended because it can cause microscopic cuts on the skin, increasing the risk of infection. Option C: Hair removal creams can cause skin irritation, which can also increase the risk of infection. Option D: Removing hair on the OT table with a razor is not a recommended method because it increases the risk of infection due to the fact that it is more difficult to maintain a sterile environment in the operating room when using a razor.

A tension pneumothorax occurs when air enters the pleural space (between the lungs and the chest wall) and becomes trapped. As more air accumulates, it can cause a shift in the position of the mediastinum (the area in the chest between the lungs that contains the heart, great vessels, and other structures), leading to compression of the lungs and blood vessels. This can result in respiratory distress, hypoxemia (low oxygen levels in the blood), and cardiovascular collapse. Treating of a tension pneumothorax involves relieving the pressure in the pleural space by inserting a needle or catheter into the chest cavity to allow the trapped air to escape. The insertion site is typically in the 5th intercostal space in the midclavicular line (i.e., the space between the fifth and",

      },
      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "swollen, and dark red arm is fasciotomy. A crush injury can result in a significant amount of tissue damage, which can lead to the development of compartment syndrome. Compartment syndrome occurs when there is increased pressure within a muscle compartment, which can result in tissue damage, nerve injury, and even loss of limb function. In this case, the patient's pulseless, swollen, and dark red arm is likely indicative of compartment syndrome, which is a medical emergency that requires immediate intervention to prevent irreversible tissue damage. Fasciotomy is a surgical procedure that involves making an incision into the affected compartment to relieve pressure and improve blood flow to the affected tissues. It is the recommended treatment for compartment syndrome in cases where conservative measures, such as elevation and pain management, are ineffective. Incorrect Choices: Option a: Intraosseous administration of fluids is a method of delivering fluids and medications directly into the bone marrow, bypassing the need for venous access. While this may be useful in certain situations, such as when venous access is difficult to obtain, it is not the appropriate treatment for compartment syndrome. Option b: Acidification of urine may be used in the management of certain types of poisoning, such as aspirin overdose, but it is not indicated in the treatment of a crush injury. Option d: Hemodialysis is a treatment for kidney failure and is not indicated in the treatment of a crush injury. Reference: .",

      "explanation": "Correct Answer: A) If the hands are visibly soiled Explanation: As per the WHO Standard Hand Hygiene Protocol , hand rub is not suitable for visibly soiled hands, and handwashing with soap and water is required to remove dirt and contaminants. Indications: Wash hands with soap and water when visibly dirty or visibly soiled with blood or other body fluids or after using the toilet. (Option A) If exposure to potential spore-forming pathogens is strongly suspected or proven, including outbreaks of Clostridium difficile , hand washing with soap and water is the preferred means. Use an alcohol-based hand rub as the preferred means for routine hand antisepsis in clinical situations if hands are not visibly soiled. (Option A) If alcohol-based hand rub is not obtainable, wash hands with soap and water. Perform hand hygiene: Before and after touching the patient. (Option D ruled out) Before handling an invasive device for patient care, regardless of whether or not gloves are used After contact with body fluids or excretions, mucous membranes, non-intact skin, or wound dressings If moving from a contaminated body site to another body site during the care of the same patient (Option B ruled out) After contact with inanimate surfaces and objects (including medical equipment) in the immediate vicinity of the patient. After removing sterile or non-sterile gloves. (Option C ruled out) Before handling medication or preparing food, perform hand hygiene using an alcohol-based hand rub or wash hands with either plain or antimicrobial soap and water. Soap and alcohol-based hand rubs should not be used concomitantly. Technique: Apply a palmful of alcohol-based hand rub and cover all surfaces of the hands. Rub hands until dry. When washing hands with soap and water, Wet hands with water and apply the amount of product necessary to cover all surfaces. Rinse hands with water and dry thoroughly with a single-use towel. Use clean, running water whenever possible. Avoid using hot water, as repeated exposure to hot water may increase the risk of dermatitis. Use towel to turn off the tap/faucet. Dry hands thoroughly using a method that does not recontaminate hands. Make sure towels are not used multiple times or by multiple people. Liquid, bar, leaf or powdered forms of soap are acceptable. When bar soap is used, small bars of soap in racks that facilitate drainage should be used to allow the bars to dry.",

A: Airway with cervical spine control Cervical spine stabilisation. (Statement 1) Assessment of the patient’s airway. Compromised airway requires a stepwise progression: Clearing the airway by suctioning secretions or blood. Simple airway manoeuvres (jaw thrust, chin lift and insertion of an oropharyngeal or nasopharyngeal airway). Advanced airway manoeuvres (intubation). (Statement 2) B: Breathing and ventilation High-flow oxygen. Assess bilateral chest raise. Assess breath sounds Use pulse oximetry Life-threatening chest pathology (tension pneumothorax, massive haemothorax and fail segment) should be diagnosed and managed. C: Circulation and haemorrhage control Monitor vitals. Heart sounds ECG Intravenous (IV) access with at least two large-bore IV cannulae (central, peripheral). (Statement 3) Blood was taken for cross-match and laboratory assessment. Treatment of shock. Control of external bleeding. D: Disability Neurological examination. Use required tubes like catheters, Ryle’s tube. E: Exposure Undress the patient Hypothermia assessment. Assess injuries (imaging like USG, CT scan, MRI). (Statement 4) Examine joints, bones, abdomen, and other systems. Look for identification marks. Secondary Survey: Detailed top-to-toe examinations after life-threatening injuries have been identified and managed during the primary survey. Patients may be intubated and unresponsive at this point, limiting the accuracy of clinical examination.

Phlebitis is the most common complication in peripheral venous access It refers to inflammation of the vein It is a common complication of peripheral venous access. It can occur due to various factors, such as chemical irritation, mechanical irritation, or infection. Isotonic saline and heparin are flushed to retain patency: To maintain the patency of central venous access devices (such as central venous catheters or central lines), periodic flushing with isotonic saline and heparin is commonly performed. This helps prevent clot formation and maintain the functionality of the line. If an arteriovenous fistula is present in a limb, avoid peripheral venous access in the same limb. An arteriovenous fistula (AVF) is a surgically created connection between an artery and a vein, typically used for hemodialysis. When an AVF is present in a limb, it is generally recommended to avoid peripheral venous access in the same limb to prevent damage to the AVF and maintain its functionality. Vasopressors for septic shock are given in the central line to avoid limb ischemia. Vasopressors for septic shock can be administered through either central venous access or peripheral venous access, depending on the clinical situation and availability of access. The choice of access depends on factors such as the stability of peripheral veins, the need for continuous infusion, and the urgency of treatment. Limb ischemia is a potential complication of vasopressor administration, but it is not exclusive to peripheral venous access.

Tension Pneumothorax It is a life-threatening condition where air accumulates in the pleural cavity under pressure, causing lung collapse on the affected side, mediastinal shift , and severe impairment of cardiovascular function. Pathology It occurs when air enters the pleural cavity through a \"one-way valve\" mechanism, leading to lung collapse and mediastinal shift towards the opposite side. ↑ Pleural pressure → Opposite lung compression → ↓ venous return → ↓ cardiac output and potentially sudden death. Aetiology Penetrating chest trauma. Blunt chest trauma with parenchymal lung injury. Iatrogenic lung injury (e.g., central venous catheterisation) and mechanical positive-pressure ventilation. Clinical Features Restlessness, tachypnea, dyspnea, tachycardia, and chest pain. Distended neck veins, hyper-resonance, and decreased or absent breath sound on the affected side. Late findings may include tracheal deviation and cyanosis. Hypotension and severe mediastinal/tracheal shift are also common. Management Needle Thoracocentesis : Immediate decompression with a large-bore needle in the 2nd intercostal space at the midclavicular line, or the \"safe triangle\". Followed by intercostal chest tube (ICT) placement in the 5th intercostal space in the anterior axillary line. Provide oxygen, analgesics, antibiotics, and ventilator support if necessary. Resuscitative thoracotomy (Option A) is used in traumatic cardiac arrest or severe haemorrhage, not for tension pneumothorax. Tension pneumothorax is urgent but not immediately fatal and should be treated with needle thoracocentesis. ICD placement (Option B) is not the immediate treatment for tension pneumothorax, as it doesn't quickly relieve pressure. Needle thoracocentesis should be performed first, with ICD placement done afterwards for ongoing drainage. Finger thoracotomy (Option D) is used for cardiac tamponade, not tension pneumothorax. Needle thoracocentesis is the preferred initial intervention for rapid decompression, while finger thoracotomy is reserved for later stages if needed.",

CT scan (Abdominal/Pelvic) (Option A) is indicated only for hemodynamically stable patients. Since this patient is unstable, CT is not appropriate . Abdominal MRI scan (Option B) MRIs are usually preferred for investigation of Soft tissue pathology, bone pathology, and head trauma. Diagnostic Peritoneal Lavage (DPL) (Option D) is rarely used now, as FAST is the preferred modality for detecting intra-abdominal bleeding.

      "explanation": "Correct answer C) To classify the priority of treatment Explanation: Triage is the process of classifying patients based on the severity of their condition and the priority of treatment required. It is commonly used in emergencies or mass casualty incidents with limited resources. Triage helps in efficiently allocating resources by prioritising patients based on the urgency of their condition. To prepare for a disaster (Option A) is incorrect because the purpose of triage is not to prepare for a disaster but rather to assess and prioritise patients during a disaster or emergency situation. To assess the impact of a disaster (Option B) is incorrect because while triage is a part of disaster response, its main objective is not to assess the overall impact of a disaster but to categorise patients based on the severity of their injuries or illnesses. To rehabilitate following a disaster (Option D) triage is not involved in the rehabilitation process after a disaster. Triage focuses on initial assessment and prioritisation of patients during the acute phase of a disaster. Reference: Bailey & Love’s Short Practice of Surgery, 28th Edition, Page 449-452",

This angle allows for proper penetration and closure of the wound edges. By inserting the needle at a right angle to the skin, the sutures can adequately hold the tissues together and provide optimal wound closure and healing. 60 degrees (Option A) would be too shallow for proper needle placement during interrupted suturing. 70 degrees (Option B) is also too shallow for interrupted suturing. 80 degrees (Option C) is closer to the correct angle of 90 degrees but is still not ideal for interrupted suturing.

In this case, the patient's symptoms of abdominal pain and obstipation, along with a history of abdominal trauma from a bull gore, raise suspicion for a hollow viscus injury. The X-ray suggestive of perforation, such as free air under the diaphragm Hemothorax (Option A) Accumulation of blood in the pleural cavity due to trauma, does not match the patient's symptoms of abdominal pain and obstipation resulting from a bull gore injury.

      "explanation": "Correct Answer: A) Hollow viscus perforation Explanation: The case of abdominal pain, fever, and an upright X-ray showing free air under the diaphragm is most likely diagnosed as hollow viscus perforation . The contents of the organ, including digestive juices and bacteria, can leak into the surrounding tissues or abdominal cavity, leading to a serious condition known as peritonitis. Diagnosis: Free air under the diaphragm (upright plain film taken at the level of the diaphragm). (Option A) Pneumoperitoneum Pneumoperitoneum refers to the presence of free gas in the peritoneal cavity, typically indicating a perforated viscus (e.g., perforated peptic ulcer). Causes: Common: Perforated peptic ulcers, bowel obstruction, inflammatory conditions, ischemia, injury during colonoscopy. Other causes without peritonitis: Postoperative (up to 7 days), peritoneal dialysis, sealed perforation, and tracking from pneumomediastinum. Diagnosis on Imaging: Erect CXR: Free gas is seen under the right hemidiaphragm (cupola sign) , but it is difficult to differentiate on the left due to gastric or colonic gas.

It is a life-threatening condition where air accumulates in the pleural cavity under pressure, causing lung collapse on the affected side, mediastinal shift , and severe impairment of cardiovascular function. Pathology: It occurs when air enters the pleural cavity through a \"one-way valve\" mechanism, leading to lung collapse and mediastinal shift towards the opposite side. ↑ Pleural pressure → Opposite lung compression → ↓ venous return → ↓ cardiac output and potentially sudden death . Aetiology: Penetrating chest trauma. Blunt chest trauma with parenchymal lung injury. Iatrogenic lung injury (e.g., central venous catheterisation), and mechanical positive-pressure ventilation. Clinical Features: Restlessness, tachypnea, dyspnea, tachycardia, and chest pain. Distended neck veins, hyper-resonance, and decreased or absent breath sound on the affected side. Late findings may include tracheal deviation and cyanosis. Hypotension and severe mediastinal/tracheal shift are also common.

      "explanation": "Correct Answer: A) Contrast-enhanced CT scan Explanation: A CT scan is a non-invasive tool that provides detailed images of abdominal organs and can identify injuries, bleeding, or fractures in patients with abdominal pain after a road traffic accident. The most commonly injured organ in: Blunt trauma abdomen is the spleen > liver. Penetrating trauma is the liver. Gunshot injury is the small intestine > large bowel > liver > intra-abdominal vasculature. The most commonly injured part of the bowel in blunt trauma abdomen is the jejunum and the ileum. The most commonly injured structure in seat belt injury is the mesentery. First investigation done in blunt trauma abdomen: FAST (Focused Assessment with Sonography for Trauma). Investigation of choice for stable blunt trauma abdomen: CECT (Contrast-Enhanced CT scan). (Option A) Retrograde urethrogram (Option B) is used to assess urethral injuries, especially with pelvic fractures or blood at the meatus, but it isn't the best initial test for abdominal pain with left lumbar tenderness. Wait and watch (Option C) may be considered if the patient is stable with no immediate concern, but in trauma with abdominal pain and tenderness, proper investigation is crucial to rule out serious injuries. Emergency laparotomy (Option D) is a major surgery and should be done only if there's clear evidence of a life-threatening condition, like active bleeding or peritonitis. It's not the first choice for investigation here. Reference: Textbook of SRB’s Surgical Operations, 6th Edition, Page 139. Bailey & Love's Short Practice of Surgery, 28th Edition, Page 381.",

It is a rapid, non-invasive ultrasound examination used primarily in trauma settings to detect free fluid (such as blood) in the abdomen or Thorax. It can be used to assess the hepatorenal, splenorenal, and pelvis spaces for fluid that is considered to be blood in a trauma case. It is a valuable tool in the early management of trauma patients as it helps identify life-threatening conditions, such as internal bleeding, which may require immediate surgical intervention.

      "correct_answer": "D",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: D) 32 year old woman with renal failure Explanation: A 32-year-old woman with renal failure is the most suitable recipient for the donor's organs as the age match between the donor and the recipient increases the likelihood of a successful transplant. When it comes to organ donation, the primary considerations for choosing the recipient include matching the donor's organ characteristics such as size, blood type, and tissue compatibility, as well as the recipient's health status and likelihood of receiving benefit from the transplant. Optimal transplantation involves choosing donors and recipients of similar age , among other factors, to minimise compatibility challenges 14-year-old child with multi-organ dysfunction syndrome (Option A): A 14-year-old child with multi-organ dysfunction syndrome is likely to have a more complicated prognosis, and the organs of a 32-year-old woman may not be the best match for a pediatric recipient. 50-year alcoholic man with liver cirrhosis with 1-month abstinence (Option B): Even though he has been abstinent for a month, liver transplant eligibility often requires a longer period of sobriety, as relapse can occur and impact the success of the transplant. Additionally, liver transplants are often prioritized for individuals with urgent needs or a better prognosis. 70-year-old woman with end-stage renal disease (Option C): The 70-year-old woman's potential benefit from a kidney transplant needs careful consideration of her age and associated comorbidities.

      "explanation": "Correct Answer C - Taking CT scan of the patient Taking a CT scan is not part of the primary survey because it is a diagnostic tool used in the secondary survey . ATLS protocol/ Advanced Trauma Life Support protocol: Primary survey: It includes the airway, breathing, circulation, disability or neurologic condition, and exposure and environmental control, which is known by the mnemonic ABCDE. The airway is assessed immediately by a verbal response, and if it is not clear, needful intervention is carried out. (Option D ruled out) Breathing is evaluated by chest movements, breath sounds and saturation and assisted ventilation is provided if needed. Circulation assessment includes ruling out shock . Assessment of circulatory status (e.g., blood pressure, pulses, bleeding), maintaining IV access and immediate fluid resuscitation are recommended according to the ATLS in case of shock. (Option A ruled out) Neurological assessment is done to assess any traumatic brain or spinal injury and neurogenic shock. The GCS score is evaluated. Environmental control: The patient's clothes should be removed for a thorough examination, and hypothermia should be prevented (warm IV fluids, raised room temperature, body warmers). (Option B ruled out) Secondary survey: This includes a complete patient history and a thorough head-to-toe assessment. It is done almost immediately in stable patients and includes radiological investigations. The AMPLE history mnemonic is used to gather key details ( A llergies, M edications, P ast medical history, L ast meal, E vents/ E nvironment related to the injury). Face deformities, posterior neck injuries, the torso, a per rectal examination for GI bleed, and prostate location are all included in this step. A thorough neurological examination and evaluation of superficial injuries are done. The complete physical examination and use of imaging are now included in the tertiary survey.

      "explanation": "Correct Answer: A) Lymphedema Explanation: Lymphedema refers to the accumulation of lymph fluid in the interstitial tissue, typically resulting in chronic non-pitting edema . In this type of edema, when pressure is applied to the swollen area, the indentation doesn't remain. Causes of Primary Lymphedema Congenital Lymphedema Lymphedema Praecox Lymphedema Tarda Age: Seen in < 1 year of age Present at birth. Lower limb, genitalia, and face are involved. Usually, B/L and multiple limbs are involved. Familial version of congenital lymphedema – known as Milroy’s disease. M/C type of primary lymphedema (>90% of cases). Age: 1 to 35 years. M/C seen in females. Usually U/L. Involves calf and foot Familial version of lymphedema praecox - known as Meig's disease. Age: Usually seen in > 35 years age group It is a rare disease. Secondary Lymphedema Filariasis MC overall cause of lymphedema worldwide MC secondary cause of lymphedema Lymphoedema due to Lymphatic obstruction Surgery Axillary block dissection- MC cause of secondary lymphedema in the USA MC iatrogenic cause of secondary lymphedema Inguinal block dissection Lymphedema due to Lymphatic disruption Infections Tuberculosis Syphilis Fungal and Bacterial infections Other causes: Trauma Malignancy Radiotherapy Arterial Disorders (Option B) like peripheral artery disease (PAD) generally present with claudication and other signs of ischemia , such as cold extremities , pale skin , and ulcers . Eedema is not a common finding here. Venous Disorders (Option C) can cause oedema in the lower extremities. However, in venous disorders, the oedema is due to venous stasis , and it's generally pitting rather than non-pitting . Signs like varicose veins or venous ulcers are also present. Coronary heart disease (Option D) mainly affects the coronary arteries and leads to symptoms such as chest pain , shortness of breath , and possibly heart attacks . While heart failure (due to CHD) can cause edema in the legs, which is usually pitting because it results from fluid retention and venous congestion due to impaired cardiac function .

      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: A) eFAST Explanation: eFAST (Extended Focused Assessment with Sonography for Trauma) is the next step in management for trauma patients to evaluate for free fluid (such as blood) in the abdomen or pericardium. It is a rapidly available ultrasound examination done to find intraperitoneal fluid. It can be used to assess the hepatorenal, splenorenal, and pelvis spaces for fluid that is considered to be blood in a trauma case. If clear lung fields on the chest radiography rule out pneumothorax or hemothorax, eFAST can help detect other sources of bleeding, such as intraperitoneal haemorrhage, to guide further management. Tube thoracostomy (Option B) is usually performed if there is evidence of a pneumothorax or hemothorax. Since the chest radiograph showed clear lung fields, there is no immediate indication for this intervention. CECT chest & abdomen (Option C & D) is done later, not immediately, as in the primary assessment. Though this could be useful for detecting more subtle injuries, a clear chest X-ray makes this less urgent, and an eFAST is a quicker first step.

While diabetic foot ulcers and infections are common, the given clinical scenario and the image provided are more indicative of a severe soft tissue infection like necrotizing fasciitis rather than a typical diabetic foot ulcer. Option B: Burn: Burns are caused by thermal, chemical, electrical, or radiation injury. While walking barefoot on hot sand can result in burns, the clinical presentation and the image showing extensive tissue involvement, necrosis, and signs of infection are not consistent with a simple burn injury. Option D: Cellulitis: Cellulitis is a common bacterial skin infection characterized by redness, warmth, swelling, and tenderness of the affected area.

The reef knot, also known as the square knot, is a type of knot that is commonly used for joining two ends of a single line together. It is formed by interlocking the ends of the line in opposite directions, creating a flat, symmetrical knot. To tie a reef knot, you can follow these steps: Take the two ends of the line you want to join. Cross the right end over the left end. Bring the right end under the left end. Pass the right end over the left end again. Pull both ends simultaneously to tighten the knot. Incorrect Option: Option A: Half hitch knot: The half hitch knot is a simple knot that is created by passing the working end of a rope over and around a post or another rope and then through the loop created. It is commonly used for temporary or light-duty applications, such as securing a line to a pole or creating a simple loop. The half hitch knot involves a single turn around an object, while the reef knot involves interlocking turns of two ends. Option C : Surgeon's knot: The surgeon's knot is a knot commonly used in surgical procedures and also in various other applications that require a secure knot. It is an extension of the reef knot, designed to be more secure. The surgeon's knot involves tying an additional half hitch before completing the knot, which adds more friction and stability.

      "explanation": "involves tissue necrosis, possibly due to a traumatic event such as a road traffic accident (RTA). Debridement of necrotic tissue involves the removal of dead or damaged tissue to prevent infection and promote healing. Hyperbaric oxygen therapy (HBOT) treats various conditions, including tissue necrosis, by increasing the amount of oxygen that reaches the damaged tissues. The high pressure helps dissolve more oxygen in the blood, stimulating the growth of new blood vessels and promoting tissue regeneration. The combination of debridement and hyperbaric oxygen therapy can be particularly effective in tissue necrosis caused by ischemia, as it helps restore blood flow and oxygenation to the affected area. Incorrect Choices: Incorrect Options: Option A - Debridement of necrotic tissue with primary closure: Debridement of necrotic tissue with primary closurecan trap bacteria and other debris inside the wound, increasing the risk of infection and delaying healing. Option C - Amputation: Amputation may be necessary in severe cases of tissue necrosis that cannot be treated by other means. However, amputation is a last resort Option D - Clean and close with rotation flap: In cases of tissue necrosis, a rotation flap alongside cleaning may be suitable for small affected areas with healthy surrounding tissue, but it's less likely to be suitable for extensive damage, where debridement and HBOT are preferable.

      "explanation": "gets trapped in the soft tissues around the surgical site, causing swelling and discomfort. In the case of a tracheostomy, a common cause of surgical emphysema is improper technique during the procedure. Tight suturing around the tracheostomy site can lead to air leakage into the surrounding tissues. When sutures are placed too tightly, they can tear the tissues or fail to adequately seal the surgical site, allowing air to escape and become trapped in the subcutaneous tissues, resulting in surgical emphysema. Incorrect Options: Option A - Puncture of posterior wall: Puncture of the posterior wall of the trachea during a tracheostomy can indeed cause air to leak into the surrounding tissues, leading to surgical emphysema. However, it is less common than issues related to suturing technique. This situation could lead to more severe complications, including mediastinal emphysema. Option B - High tracheostomy: A high tracheostomy (placing the tracheostomy tube above the second or third tracheal ring) can cause complications, but it is not typically associated with surgical emphysema. More common issues include difficulty in stabilizing the tracheostomy tube and increased risk of subglottic stenosis. Option C - Blockage of the tube: Blockage of the tracheostomy tube can cause respiratory distress or hypoxia but is not typically associated with surgical emphysema. Air trapping in the soft tissues around the tracheostomy site is not a direct result of tube blockage. Reference: Prepladder Notes",

These organs are richly vascularized, and damage to them can result in significant internal bleeding, leading to hypovolemic shock. Hypovolemic shock occurs when there is a rapid loss of blood or fluids, causing a decrease in circulating blood volume and inadequate tissue perfusion. Incorrect Options: Option B - Head injury : While head injuries can be severe and life-threatening, they are not typically a direct cause of shock.. Option C - Septicemia : Septicemia, also known as sepsis, is characterized by a systemic inflammatory response to an infection. While septicemia can cause shock, it is not typically associated with traumatic cases. Option D - Cardiac failure : Cardiac failure, which refers to the inability of the heart to pump blood effectively, can lead to shock. However, in traumatic cases, shock is more commonly attributed to other factors such as blood loss or fluid loss. Reference: Prepladder Notes",

Therefore, intubation is not the immediate priority. Option C - Start intravenous fluids urgently: While administering intravenous fluids may be necessary for the management of hypotension, in this case, the primary concern is the potential tension pneumothorax. Option D - Take a chest X-ray: Chest X-ray is an important diagnostic tool to confirm the presence of a pneumothorax and assess its severity.
