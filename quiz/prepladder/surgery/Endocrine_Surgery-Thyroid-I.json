      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: B) Pendred syndrome Explanation: Pendred syndrome is characterized by a combination of congenital sensorineural hearing loss, recurrent vertigo, and the presence of a palpable thyroid gland. The family history of similar symptoms in the mother further supports this diagnosis, indicating autosomal recessive inheritance. Clinical Features: Sensorineural Hearing Loss: Typically congenital and can be progressive. Vertigo: Recurrent episodes due to vestibular dysfunction. Euthyroid Goiter: A goitre present with normal thyroid function (euthyroidism). Metabolic Alkalosis: Sometimes observed due to associated acid-base balance abnormalities. Investigations: Genetic Testing: Confirmatory; involves direct sequencing of the SLC26A4 gene. CT Temporal Bone: To detect temporal bone abnormalities, such as an enlarged vestibular aqueduct. Thyroid Function Tests: Regular monitoring of TSH, T3, and T4 levels is recommended. Treatment: No definitive management Hearing Aids and Cochlear Implants: To manage hearing loss. Medical and Surgical Interventions: For managing goiter size if necessary. Genetic Counselling. Alport syndrome is characterized by hearing impairment along with renal and ocular involvement ( Option A ) Usher syndrome includes sensorineural hearing loss along with retinitis pigmentosa ( Option C ) Perrault syndrome involves Progressive sensorineural hearing loss with ovarian involvement ( Option D ) Reference: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK549839/",

      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: B) Lahey’s method Explanation: In Lahey's method, the examiner places the fingers of one hand on the patient’s neck to support the thyroid gland, while the other hand palpates the gland’s surface to assess its size, texture, and any nodules. This technique helps in assessing the consistency and mobility of the thyroid gland, which are important for diagnosing conditions like goiter or thyroid nodules. In Kocher’s method, slight pressure is applied to the lateral lobes of the thyroid gland to evaluate the impact of thyroid swelling on the trachea. A positive test indicates that thyroid swelling is compressing the trachea, leading to stridor ( Option A ) In Crile’s method, the examiner places a thumb on the swelling and asks the patient to swallow. This technique is used to assess the nodularity of the thyroid swelling. As the patient swallows, the movement of the thyroid gland can help in evaluating the presence and extent of nodules ( Option C ) Pizillo’s method is used in patients with an obese or short neck where visual inspection of the thyroid gland is difficult. The patient places their hand behind",

      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: A) Medullary thyroid carcinoma Explanation: In medullary thyroid carcinoma , the thyroid follicular cells don't take up iodine and hence radioactive iodine has no role. Medullary thyroid carcinoma : Origin It arises from the parafollicular 'C' cells, which are derived from the ultimobranchial body (neural crest). Secrete High levels of serum calcitonin and carcinoembryonic antigen Types 2 types: a) Sporadic: 80% cases, seen in 5th-6th decade, U/L b) Familial: 20% cases, associated with MEN 2A/2B Mutation RET proto-oncogene mutation Clinical features Thyroid swelling often with enlargement of neck lymph nodes, diarrhea, flushing, hypertension, pheochromocytomas and mucosal neuromas when associated with MEN II syndrome. Investigation of choice FNAC Treatment Tumor localized to thyroid: total thyroidectomy + central neck dissection + Ipsilateral MRND (If the tumor size is > 1 cm) ± Bilateral MRND (If any lymph node is positive despite the extensive surgery). Radioactive iodine therapy can serve three primary roles: Remnant Ablation: Destruction of any remaining benign thyroid tissue following a total or subtotal thyroidectomy. Adjuvant Therapy: Additional treatment post-surgery to reduce the risk of cancer recurrence. Treatment of Known Disease: Targeting and destroying residual cancer cells or recurrent structural or biochemical disease.

      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: B) Graves disease, TSH receptor Explanation: Symptoms such as weight loss, palpitations, and eye protrusion, combined with low TSH and elevated T3 and T4 levels, indicate Graves disease , an autoimmune disorder. In this condition, antibodies target and bind to the TSH receptor . Graves disease: Graves disease is an autoimmune disease with increased levels of specific antibodies in the blood (TSH receptor antibodies). Thyroid stimulating immunoglobulins (TSl)/thyroid stimulating antibodies (Ts Ab) and long acting thyroid stimulator (LATS) cause pathological changes in the thyroid. Graves's disease often presents without any obvious thyroid swelling in the neck. Whenever, there is unexplained behavioural problem, insomnia, myopathy, unexplained diarrhoea or loss of weight, tachycardia, Graves's disease should be suspected and evaluated Clinical features: Hyperthyroidism: Weight loss, palpitations, heat intolerance, tremors, anxiety, irritability, and increased appetite due to an accelerated metabolic rate. Orbitopathy (Thyroid Eye Disease): Exophthalmos (eye protrusion), eyelid retraction, double vision, and eye irritation/redness. Dermopathy (Pretibial Myxedema): Thickened, waxy skin with an orange-peel texture and non-pitting oedema, typically over the shins. Acropachy: Clubbing of fingers and toes, soft tissue swelling, and periosteal bone formation. A.Orbitopathy B. Acropachy C. Dermopathy (pretibial myxedema) Toxic multinodular goitre causes hyperthyroidism due to autonomously functioning nodules; the primary target is not the TSH receptor ( Option A ) Hashimoto's Thyroiditis is an autoimmune hypothyroid condition targeting TPO (thyroid peroxidase), presenting with high TSH and low T3/T4 ( Option C ) Subacute Thyroiditis f ollows a viral infection, causing transient hyperthyroidism with elevated thyroglobulin; not associated with eye protrusion ( Option D )",

      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: A) Thyroidectomy Explanation: Thyroidectomy is a suitable next step for patients with persistent symptoms and a large goitre not responding adequately to medical management. Graves disease: An autoimmune disorder characterised by the production of long-acting thyroid stimulator (LATS) or thyroid-stimulating autoantibodies against the TSH receptor, which results in Hyperthyroidism. Increased beta-receptor expression results in sympathetic stimulation (Tachycardia, Fine tremors, Sweating) Characteristic Features: Thyrotoxicosis (Symptoms of Hyperthyroidism) Ophthalmopathy (Exophthalmos): Accumulation of areolar tissue behind the eye. Pretibial Myxedema Gynaecomastia Diagnosis: Clinical: Presence of eye signs in hyperthyroid patients. Confirmatory Test: Detection of thyroid-stimulating autoantibodies. Eye Signs: Stellwag's Sign Reduced blink rate or incomplete blinking. Dalrymple’s Sign Visible upper sclera with lid retraction Von Graefe's Sign Lid lag on down gaze Joffroy's Sign Absence of Forehead wrinkling on Upgaze Moebius Sign Loss of Accommodation Management: Medical management: Propranolol (provide symptomatic relief) Antithyroid drugs like Propylthiouracil (DOC in 1st trimester), Methimazole, and Carbimazole (Can be given in 2n and 3rd trimesters) Surgical Intervention: Total Thyroidectomy is the treatment of choice, especially when other methods fail or are contraindicated (Lugol’s iodine is used for the pre-operative preparation). Adults with Goiter are managed by drugs followed by surgery. Radioactive Iodine (RAI) Ablation: Indications: Elderly patients with surgical comorbidities or recurrence after surgery. Contraindications: Pregnancy, Lactation, Patient with eye signs (worsens Ophthalmopathy) (Option B) Antithyroid medications and beta-blockers ( Option C ) Given the patient's persistent symptoms despite six months of treatment, continuing these medications is unlikely to resolve the issue effectively.

      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: A) NSAIDs Explanation: The clinical presentation and diagnostic findings strongly indicate De Quervain’s thyroiditis (subacute or granulomatous thyroiditis), in which NSAIDs are used as first-line treatment. De Quervain’s Thyroiditis: Often follows a viral upper respiratory tract infection. Initial Brief Hyperthyroidism due to follicular destruction followed by Hypothyroidism, which returns to an Euthyroid state in a few months. (Self Limiting) Associated with HLA B35 IOC : FNAC Clinical Features: Neck Pain and Tenderness. Symptoms of Hyperthyroidism and Hypothyroidism depend upon stage. Management: Self Limiting Condition NSAIDs: First-line treatment to control pain and inflammation. Steroids: Used if NSAIDs are ineffective Levothyroxine: Given only during the Hypothyroid phase (Option B is ruled out) Start antithyroid drugs( Option C ) Antithyroid drugs are used for treating hyperthyroidism. However, transient hyperthyroidism in De Quervain’s thyroiditis is not managed with anti-thyroid medications; the primary treatment focuses on alleviating inflammation rather than directly modifying thyroid hormone levels. Thyroidectomy is generally not required for De Quervain’s thyroiditis. It is reserved for cases suspected of malignancy or severe complications that do not respond to medical management ( Option D ) Reference: Bailey & Love’s Short Practice of Surgery, 28th Edition, Page 872.",

      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "Correct answer: A) To block the conversion of T4 to T3 Explanation: Glucocorticoids act by inhibiting the conversion of T4 to T3 , thus reducing the metabolic effects of excess thyroid hormone and offering adrenal support during the crisis. Thyroid storm is a life-threatening exacerbation of hyperthyroidism that requires urgent hospital management due to its high mortality risk. Management of Thyroid storm Oxygen supplementation IV fluids (with continuous monitoring with central venous catheter) Stop IV fluids/blood transfusion in case of CHF or arrhythmias Propylthiouracil This is the drug of choice It acts by blocking the thyroid hormone synthesis & inhibiting peripheral conversion of T4 to T3 (Option B) ROA: NG Tube, rectal route Methimazole can be used as an alternative option instead of Propylthiouracil Beta-blockers Propranolol is commonly used It reduces the heart rate & the effects of catecholamines (Option C) Esmolol is used in case of heart failure as Propranolol should be avoided in such conditions Glucocorticoids Hydrocortisone is preferred It acts by inhibiting the conversion of T4 to T3 It helps in preventing adrenal crisis Lugol solution It blocks the release of T3 and T4 and to reduce the vascularity of the thyroid (Option D) It is also used preoperatively to prevent thyroid storms by inducing the Wolff-Chaikoff effect.

      "explanation": "Correct Answer: B) Wolff-Chaikoff effect Explanation: The Wolff-Chaikoff effect is characterized by temporary inhibition of thyroid hormone synthesis in response to excess iodine. In individuals with preexisting thyroid conditions, such as multinodular goiter, a high dose of iodine can lead to reduced synthesis of thyroid hormones, causing elevated TSH levels and low free T4 levels, even in the absence of symptoms. Jod- Basedow effect occurs when excess iodine induces hyperthyroidism in individuals with pre existing thyroid disease, typically causing elevated thyroid hormones ( Option A ) Amiodarone-induced thyrotoxicosis ( Option C): Associated with high iodine content, it can lead to hyperthyroidism or thyrotoxicosis rather than hypothyroidism.

        "D": "Near the inferior thyroid artery"
      },
      "correct_answer": "D",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: D) Near the inferior thyroid artery Explanation: Recurrent laryngeal nerve (RLN) due to its anatomical location runs in close proximity to inferior thyroid artery, which makes it vulnerable during dissection or ligation of the artery during thyroidectomy. The recurrent laryngeal nerve, a branch of the vagus nerve, divides into the right and left recurrent laryngeal nerves. It originates from the sixth branchial arches, below the sixth aortic arches. Left Recurrent Laryngeal Nerve: Loops around the ligamentum arteriosum and travels along the tracheoesophageal groove to reach the thyroid gland. Right Recurrent Laryngeal Nerve: Follows a direct path from the vagus nerve to the larynx due to the absence of a normal right subclavian-carotid junction in embryonic development. Injury to the RLN can result in hoarseness, aphonia, stridor, and aspiration. Through the carotid sheath ( Option A ) The recurrent laryngeal nerve is not a content of the carotid sheath. The contents of the carotid sheath include the common carotid artery, internal jugular vein, vagus nerve, and sympathetic plexus. At the level of the Zuckerkandl tubercle ( Option B ) The Zuckerkandl tubercle is a projection of normal thyroid tissue. During thyroidectomy, these tubercles are usually removed. While injury can occur in this area, it is less common than near the inferior thyroid artery. At the level of the cricothyroid muscle ( Option C ) Injury at this site affects the external branch of the superior laryngeal nerve, not the recurrent laryngeal nerve, and thus leads to difficulty with high-pitched sounds rather than hoarseness or stridor.

      "correct_answer": "D",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: D) 1,2,4 Explanation: The primary role of Lugol's iodine in the pre-operative management of a patient with a goitre is to reduce thyroid gland vascularity. (Statement 1) Lugol’s Iodine is a Saturated Potassium Iodide Solution (5% iodine + 10% potassium iodide) Dose : 3 drops TID for 7-10 days. Role of Lugol’s Iodine: Reduce Vascularity: Used pre-operatively to reduce the vascularity of the thyroid gland. This helps in minimizing bleeding during surgery and prevents complications. Prevent Thyroid Storm: By decreasing vascularity, it also helps prevent thyroid storms, which can occur if there is an excessive release of thyroid hormones during or after surgery. (Statement 5) Iodine's Effect: Iodine has a transient effect on thyroid function by inhibiting the release of thyroid hormones from the thyroid gland (Statement 2) . This phenomenon is known as the Wolff-Chaikoff effect . In Toxic Multinodular Goiter , Lugol's iodine may not achieve the goal of temporary euthyroidism, and instead may exacerbate hyperthyroidism due to the Jod-Basedow phenomenon. (Statement 4) It Increases the uptake of radioactive iodine (Statement 3): Lugol's iodine does not increase radioactive iodine uptake; rather, it prepares the thyroid gland for surgery by reducing vascularity.

      "explanation": "Correct Answer: A) Riedel’s Thyroiditis Explanation: Riedel’s thyroiditis is the most likely diagnosis, given the hard, fixed thyroid mass, absence of tenderness, and ultrasound findings of extensive fibrosis. Riedel’s Thyroiditis (Fibrosing Thyroiditis): Replacement of thyroid tissue with fibrous tissue. There is both intrathyroidal as well as extrathyroidal fibrosis. It may be unilateral or bilateral. Associated with Retroperitoneal Fibrosis, Peyronie’s and Dupuytren’s Contracture. Clinical Features: Permanent hypothyroidism and hypoparathyroidism. Stridor, with positive Berry's sign (absence/impalpable carotid pulsation). Hard, woody thyroid gland compresses midline structures: Trachea: Causes dyspnea. Esophagus: Causes dysphagia. Recurrent laryngeal nerve: Causes hoarseness of voice. Diagnosis: FNAC often yields poor results. Differentiation from anaplastic carcinoma is made via biopsy Management: Lifelong levothyroxine for hypothyroidism. Lifelong calcium and vitamin D supplementation for hypoparathyroidism. Features Hashimoto Thyroiditis (Option B) De Quervain’s Thyroiditis (Option C) Riedel’s Thyroiditis Also Known As Struma Lymphomatosa Viral Thyroiditis, Granulomatous Thyroiditis Fibrosing Thyroiditis Riedel struma Etiology Autoimmune Anti-TPO antibodies HLA-B8/DR3 Viral infection, Granulomatous inflammation HLA-B35 Autoimmune or a part of systemic fibrosing disorder Clinical Features Initial Hyperthyroidism followed by Prolonged Hypothyroidism Brief Hyperthyroidism followed by Hypothyroidism and returns to Euthyroid state in 3 - 4 months Permanent hypothyroidism and hypoparathyroidism. Management Levothyroxine Total thyroidectomy if malignancy is suspected. NSAIDs (first-line) Steroids (if NSAIDs are ineffective) >90% spontaneous resolution Corticosteroids and tamoxifen Life long management with Levothyroxine Calcium & vitamin D in case of hypoparathyroidism Silent thyroiditis is a form of subacute thyroiditis that is usually painless. It presents with transient thyroid dysfunction (hyperthyroidism followed by hypothyroidism) and is generally less associated with a hard and fixed thyroid mass ( Option D ) Reference: 1.

      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: A) Propylthiouracil Explanation: Propylthiouracil (PTU) is the drug of choice during the first trimester of pregnancy for treating hyperthyroidism due to its safety profile in early pregnancy. It is safe during pregnancy and in lactation but has less efficacy than methimazole. It is also helpful in thyrotoxic crisis (blocks conversion of T4 to T3) It is associated with the risk of liver toxicity. Methimazole is an anti-thyroid drug with greater efficacy than propylthiouracil but is not advised in the first trimester as it leads to aplasia cutis and methimazole embryopathy; Safe in late pregnancy ( Option B ) Levothyroxine is used in hypothyroid conditions ( Option C ) Propranolol is a beta-blocker that can help control severe symptoms of hyperthyroidism but does not address the underlying condition and is not a first-line treatment for managing Graves disease ( Option D ) Reference: Bailey & Love’s Short Practice of Surgery, 28th edition, Page 861, 862. https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK279107/",

      },
      "correct_answer": "D",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: D) Solitary Thyroid Nodule Explanation: FNAC is the investigation of choice for Solitary thyroid nodules. Fine Needle Aspiration Cytology (FNAC) is a minimally invasive diagnostic procedure to evaluate abnormalities in various tissues, including thyroid nodules. Provides cytological details but not the Architecture. It is useful in papillary/medullary (amyloid)/anaplastic carcinomas, colloid nodules, autoimmune or granulomatous thyroiditis. A 23G needle is used. Suspicious solitary/multiple nodules/ dominant nodules should be aspirated. Minimum six aspirations should be done. An adequate FNAC smear should have six aspirations with six groups of cells with each group containing 20 cells. USG-guided aspiration is better. Diagnostic accuracy of FNAC is 95%; sensitivity 85%; specificity 94%. Classification of FNAC reports: Thy 1 Non diagnostic Thy 1c Non diagnostic cystic Thy 2 Non neoplastic Thy 3 Follicular Thy 4 Suspicion of malignancy Thy 5 Malignant Limitations of FNAC: Follicular Neoplasms: FNAC cannot differentiate between follicular adenoma and follicular carcinoma because it does not provide information about the capsule or vascular invasion. Further biopsy is needed for a definitive diagnosis. (Option A) Riedel’s Thyroiditis: In this, the thyroid gland is replaced by fibrous tissue, which can result in a poor yield of cells, reducing the effectiveness of FNAC. (Option B) Thyroid Lymphoma: FNAC may not provide sufficient information to diagnose thyroid lymphoma accurately. A biopsy is required to obtain tissue samples for specific markers and a more comprehensive diagnosis. (Option C) Reference: 1. Bailey & Love’s Short Practice of Surgery, 28th Edition, Page 866. 2.

      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: C) Iodine-131 (I-131) Explanation: Iodine-131 is the isotope used for radioactive iodine ablation therapy as it provides both the therapeutic beta radiation and the gamma rays necessary for imaging and monitoring. Radioactive Iodine Ablation (RAI): Isotope Used : Iodine-131 (Half Life - 8 Days) Emission: Beta Rays : 90% of emissions; provides the therapeutic effect by penetrating up to 0.5 mm, allowing targeted treatment of the thyroid gland while sparing surrounding tissues. Gamma Rays: 10% of emissions; used for imaging and also responsible for side effects. Applications: Primarily for Differentiated Thyroid Cancer (DTC) like Papillary Thyroid Carcinoma (PTC) and Follicular Thyroid Carcinoma (FTC) Indications: Post-Thyroidectomy : To eliminate remaining thyroid tissue, prevent cancer recurrence, and treat residual disease In follicular carcinoma of thyroid, after total thyroidectomy, if there are secondaries elsewhere in the body, as in bones or lungs, then radioiodine therapy is given. I-131 is given orally in a dose of 5 millicuries (160 microcurie/g of thyroid). It ablates the residual disease in the thyroid bed. Clinically Detectable Disease: When surgery is not feasible Side Effects : (Dose-Dependent): Sialadenitis, nasolacrimal duct obstruction, transient swelling, infertility, secondary malignancies (e.g., leukemia) Absolute Contraindications: Pregnancy and Breastfeeding RADIOACTIVE ISOTOPES USED IN THYROID: ISOTOPES ROUTE OF ADMINISTRATION HALF-LIFE TYPES OF RAYS USE I-123 (Option A) Oral 13 hours I -rays For diagnostic purposes I-124 PET scan in thyroid cancer 4 days - - I-125 (Option B) Oral 60 days I -rays Diagnostic purposes and, in some cases, for brachytherapy I-131 Oral 8 days I and I -rays Radioactive iodine ablation therapy I-132 (Option D) Oral 2.3 hours - Used in research Tc-99 scan IV 6 hours - Technetium is better at identifying non-functioning secondaries.
