      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: B) Inferior alveolar nerve Explanation: Inferior alveolar nerve runs through the mandibular canal and is at risk of injury in fractures of the mandible, especially those involving the body of the mandible, like butterfly fractures. Butterfly Fractures of the Mandible: Also Known As : \"Bucket handle\" fractures. Type : Bilateral body fractures of the mandible. Common Causes : High-energy impacts (e.g., motor vehicle accidents, assaults). Main Complication : Airway obstruction. Characteristics and Mechanism: Appearance : Fracture creates a \"butterfly\" pattern. Impact : Significant compromise of mandible’s structural integrity. Injury Mechanism : Involves high-force trauma, potentially leading to additional injuries in surrounding tissues. Diagnosis: Methods : Clinical Examination : Initial assessment. Imaging : X-rays, CT scans for detailed fracture evaluation. Management Strategies: Method Indication Details Closed Reduction Non-displaced or minimally displaced fractures Uses intermaxillary fixation (MMF) for stabilization. Open Reduction and Internal Fixation (ORIF) Displaced fractures Surgical realignment and stabilization using plates/screws. Complications: Malocclusion : Misalignment of teeth. Non-union : Failure of the fracture to heal properly. Nerve Injury : Particularly to the inferior alveolar nerve, causing altered sensation in the lower lip. (Option B) Lingual nerve (Option A ruled out) : This nerve is less likely to be injured in a mandibular body fracture as it is located more medially and higher up in the jaw. Hypoglossal nerve (Option C ruled out) : This nerve is involved in tongue movement and is not typically affected by mandible fractures. Facial nerve (Option D ruled out ) : The facial nerve controls facial muscles and is usually affected by fractures of the zygomatic arch or parotid area, not the mandible.

      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: B) Inferior alveolar nerve Explanation: The inferior alveolar nerve, a branch of the mandibular nerve (V3), runs through the mandible and provides sensation to the lower teeth and lower lip. A fracture of the mandible can lead to compression or damage to this nerve, resulting in paresthesia in the lower lip. Mandibular fractures often present with several key clinical features, such as: Pain and tenderness: Especially over the site of the fracture. Malocclusion: A feeling that the teeth do not fit together properly due to misalignment of the fracture segments. Swelling and bruising: Over the area of the fracture. Step deformity: A palpable step-off along the jawline where the fracture has occurred. Paresthesia: Numbness or tingling in the lower lip and chin due to injury to the inferior alveolar nerve, which runs through the mandible. Facial nerve (Option A): primarily responsible for facial expression and not sensation in the lower lip. Mental nerve (Option C): a branch of the inferior alveolar nerve that only supplies the chin and lower lip externally. Isolated involvement of this nerve is uncommon in mandibular fractures. Lingual nerve (Option D ): provides sensation to the anterior two-thirds of the tongue, not the lower lip or jaw.",

      },
      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: C) Fusion of the palatal shelves. Explanation: Cleft palate occurs when the palatal shelves fail to elevate and fuse properly during embryonic development, typically between the 6th and 9th weeks of gestation. This results in a gap in the palate, allowing communication between the oral and nasal cavities, as evidenced by milk coming through the nasal passages during feeding. Cleft palate: Defective fusion of the various components of the palate gives rise to clefts in the palate. Complete cleft palate: Bilateral complete cleft (A): Failure of fusion of both palatine processes of maxilla with premaxilla. A y-shaped cleft will be present between primary and secondary palate and between the two halves of secondary palate. It presents as a bilateral cleft of the upper lip also. Unilateral complete cleft (B): Nonfusion of one side palatine process of maxilla with premaxilla. It",

        "D": "Intraoral hemorrhage"
      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: B) Persistent pain and facial contour deformities Explanation: Mandibular condyle fracture following assault is known as Guardsman fracture. Post-surgical complications of ORIF for mandibular condyle fractures often include persistent pain, malocclusion, and facial contour deformities, particularly in cases with multiple fracture sites. Overview of Guardsman Fractures Definition : Guardsman fractures, also known as mandibular condyle fractures, result from trauma like assaults or accidents. Location : These fractures typically occur in the mandibular condyle, the rounded end of the mandible that connects with the temporal bone. Associated Injuries : Often associated with other mandibular fractures; approximately 50% of mandibular injuries involve multiple fracture sites, complicating treatment and recovery. Management Approaches Surgical Intervention : Common Method : Open reduction and internal fixation (ORIF) is the primary treatment to realign and stabilize the fractured segments. Incision Techniques : Retromandibular Incision : Provides access to the fracture site from behind the mandible. Preauricular Incision : Allows access in front of the ear, particularly useful for accessing the condyle. Surgical Tools : Bone clamps and lag screws are typically used during surgery to achieve proper reduction. Complications : Common Issues : Persistent pain, malocclusion (misalignment of teeth), and facial contour deformities. Risk Factors : The presence of multiple fractures increases the risk of complications, making precise surgical planning crucial. Temporomandibular joint ankylosis (Option A ruled out) : Although a possible complication of condyle fractures, it is less common than pain and facial deformities following ORIF. Complete loss of mandibular function (Option C ruled out) : This is not a typical complication; ORIF aims to restore function rather than cause complete loss. Intraoral hemorrhage (Option D ruled out) : While hemorrhage can occur during surgery, it is not a common post-surgical complication specific to ORIF of the mandibular condyle.

Management of cleft lip and cleft palate: Surgical principles: Cleft lip repair: reconnects the muscles around the oral sphincter. Cleft palate repair: anatomically closes the defect, facilitates speech development, minimizes maxillary growth difference and dentoalveolar deformities. Two-stage procedures may be used to minimize dissection. Secondary management (Post op): involves regular review by a multidisciplinary team for hearing, speech, dental development, and facial growth assessment.

      },
      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: C) Thoracic Outlet Syndrome Explanation: Thoracic Outlet Syndrome (TOS) is the condition most commonly associated with a cervical rib. Definition : A cervical rib is an extra rib that arises from the seventh cervical vertebra (C7), located above the first rib. Cervical ribs can be present on one side (unilateral) or both sides (bilateral) of the body. Prevalence : It is a congenital anomaly present in about 0.5% to 1% of the population. Symptoms : Many individuals are asymptomatic. When symptoms occur, they may include neck pain, shoulder pain, or numbness/tingling in the arm and hand, supplied by segment T1. Symptoms arise due to compression of nearby structures such as nerves (e.g., brachial plexus) or blood vessels (e.g., subclavian artery), leading to conditions like Thoracic Outlet Syndrome (TOS) (Option C) , common condition associated with a cervical rib, resulting from compression of neurovascular structures. Diagnosis : Typically diagnosed via imaging studies such as X-ray (neck). Treatment : Mild cases: Sling exercises. Severe cases: Scalenotomy (Resection of scalenus anterior muscles). Troublesome cases: Excision of cervical rib. Types of cervical rib: 1. Complete cervical rib: When it reaches up to the 1 cervical rib. 2. Bulbous end. 3. Tapering end. 4. Fibrous Band: If the end is replaced by a fibrous band. Rotator Cuff Tear (Option A ruled out) : Sometimes cause pain radiating down the arm, and shoulder movement is likely to be abnormal. There are no neurological symptoms . Not associated with cervical rib. Cervical spondylosis (Option B ruled out) : It is degenerative arthritis of the spine and rarely involves the T1 nerve root. Not associated with cervical rib. Pancoast’s syndrome (Option D ruled out) : It is apical carcinoma of the bronchus invading structures at the root of the neck causing pain, numbness and weakness of the hand. Not associated with cervical rib.",

      "explanation": "Correct Answer: B) A lateral neck opening that drains mucus or saliva Explanation: A branchial fistula typically presents as a small opening on the lateral aspect of the neck, often along the anterior border of the sternocleidomastoid muscle. A branchial fistula is a congenital abnormality resulting from the incomplete obliteration of the branchial clefts or pouches during embryonic development. Origin : Typically arises from the second branchial cleft (most common), which fails to close properly. Anatomy : (Option B) The fistula is a complete ciliated columnar epithelium tract that connects the skin of the neck to the pharynx or tonsillar fossa. External Opening : Usually found along the anterior border of the sternocleidomastoid muscle in the lower third of the neck. Internal Opening : Typically located in the tonsillar fossa or near the pharyngeal wall. Clinical Presentation : May present with a small opening on the neck that drains mucus or saliva. (Option B) Can be associated with recurrent neck infections or abscesses. Swelling or discharge near the external opening is common. Diagnosis : Diagnosis is usually based on clinical examination. Imaging studies (e.g., ultrasound, fistulogram, or CT scan) may be used to delineate the fistula tract. Branchial sinus fistulography right side Treatment : Surgical excision of the entire fistula tract is the treatment of choice. Incomplete removal can lead to recurrence.",
