      "question": "A middle-aged woman presents with flank pain and dysuria. The pain was temporarily relieved by intravenous analgesics administered at a nearby primary healthcare center. She is diagnosed with ureteric colic secondary to ureteric calculi. What is the most appropriate diagnostic modality in this case? B. IIIIIII D. III Ureteroscopy",
      "options": {
        "A": "NCCT KUB",
        "C": "USG KUB"
      },
      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: A) NCCT KUB Explanation: Non-contrast computed tomography (NCCT) is considered the gold standard for diagnosing renal stones. NCCT scans provide detailed images of the urinary tract and can identify both radiopaque (visible on X-rays) and radiolucent (not easily visible on X-rays) stones. Investigations for renal stones: Urinalysis This is often the initial investigation performed. It can reveal the presence of blood (hematuria), white blood cells (pyuria), and crystals in the urine, all suggestive of a possible stone. The pH of the urine can also give clues about the type of stone. Kidney, Ureter, and Bladder (KUB) X-ray It can detect some types of stones, particularly calcium-containing stones, which appear opaque on X-rays. Ultrasound (Option C ruled out) It's particularly useful for detecting hydronephrosis (swelling of the kidney due to urine blockage) caused by stones and can be helpful during pregnancy when minimising radiation exposure is important. Intravenous urogram (IVU) It involves injecting a contrast dye into a vein. The dye travels through the bloodstream to the kidneys, where it is filtered and excreted in the urine. X-rays are taken as the dye passes through the urinary tract, outlining the kidneys, ureters, and bladder. This test can reveal blockages in the urinary tract caused by stones. IIII (Option B) is usually not the first choice for stone detection because contrast can obscure small stones . It should be avoided in suspected acute renal colic cases unless there are other indications. Ureteroscopy (Option D) is invasive and typically performed as a therapeutic procedure to remove stones, not as a diagnostic tool. It is used when stone extraction or biopsy is required but not for routine diagnosis. Reference: Bailey & Love’s Short Practice of Surgery, 28th Edition, Pages 1467, 1475, 1469",

        "A": "Psammoma bodies",
        "B": "Corpora arenacea",
        "D": "Corpora amylacea"
      },
      "correct_answer": "D",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: D) Corpora amylacea Explanation: The laminated, round, basophilic bodies that can be seen in the prostate biopsy are Corpora amylacea. They are composed of proteinaceous material often found in the prostatic acini and ducts. They are believed to be precursors of prostatic calculi and are also commonly seen in BPH. Psammoma bodie s (Option A) are concentric, calcified structures commonly seen in certain tumours, like papillary thyroid carcinoma , serous ovarian carcinoma , or meningiomas . They are not typically associated with prostate tissue or prostate biopsies. Corpora arenacea (Option B), or brain sand , are calcified deposits in the pineal gland composed of calcium salts. They are a common and typically benign finding in the brain, particularly in older individuals. III Amyloid (Option D) deposits are abnormal proteins that can accumulate in tissues in various diseases, such as amyloidosis . While it can sometimes be seen in prostate tissue in rare conditions, it is not a common finding on prostate biopsy and is not associated with the structure described in this case.",

      "question": "A newborn male presents with urinary retention, lethargy and a distended bladder. Antenatal ultrasound showed a \"keyhole sign\" with a thickened bladder wall. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?",
      "options": {
        "A": "Hypospadias",
        "B": "Vesicoureteral reflux",
        "C": "Posterior urethral valves",
        "D": "Neurogenic bladder"
      },
      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer : C) Posterior urethral valves Explanation Posterior urethral valves are characterized by membranous folds in the posterior urethra leading to urinary obstruction, which matches the \"keyhole sign\" on ultrasound and the postnatal symptoms of urinary retention and lethargy. Posterior urethral valves Definition Urinary tract obstruction in male infants from membranous folds in the posterior urethra. Complications Chronic kidney disease, pulmonary hypoplasia from oligohydramnios. Classification Type I: Posterior urethral folds Type II: Membranes at bladder neck Type III: Round membrane at verumontanum Etiology Congenital, unclear embryological origin. Pathophysiology Increased bladder pressure → hypertrophy, vesicoureteric reflux, renal damage Diagnostic Tools Ultrasound, VCUG (voiding cystourethrogram) and Renal scintigraphy. Antenatal Diagnosis Ultrasound: Dilated bladder (\"keyhole sign\"), thickened walls. Postnatal Symptoms Urinary retention, infections, lethargy, respiratory distress. Management Antenatal: Vesicostomy, fetal valve ablation Postnatal: Stabilization, cystoscopic ablation Prognosis Depends on severity; long-term care needed for CKD, bladder dysfunction, recurrent UTIs. Hypospadias involves an abnormal urethral opening and does not present with the obstructive symptoms described, such as a distended bladder and urinary retention. (Option A) Vesicoureteral reflux can occur secondary to posterior urethral valves but is not the primary condition associated with the described ultrasound findings and symptoms. (Option B) Neurogenic bladder results from nerve damage affecting bladder function, but it is not typically associated with the \"keyhole sign\" seen in posterior urethral valves.

      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "void → Suggests urethral obstruction . History of perineal injury → Strongly suggests trauma to the anterior urethra . Blood at the meatus → A classic sign of urethral injury . Bulbar urethral injury is common in perineal trauma : Common mechanism : Straddle injuries (e.g., fall on a hard surface). Bulbar urethra is vulnerable due to its location in the anterior urethra. Extravasation of urine may be seen if severe. Urethral Injuries Urethral Segment Common Causes of Injury Clinical Features Bulbar urethra (Anterior) Straddle injuries, blunt perineal trauma Blood at meatus, urinary retention, perineal hematoma Membranous urethra (Posterior) Pelvic fractures High-riding prostate, inability to pass urine Intraperitoneal Bladder Rupture Blunt abdominal trauma Peritonitis, urinary ascites Posterior Urethral Valve Congenital anomaly Recurrent UTIs, voiding difficulty Posterior urethral valve (Option B): Incorrect because it is a congenital condition seen in infants, not in a previously healthy young adult. Intraperitoneal bladder rupture (Option C): Incorrect because it presents with peritonitis and urinary ascites , not blood at the meatus or perineal trauma. Membranous urethra (Option D): Incorrect because it is typically injured in pelvic fractures , which are not mentioned in the history.

      "explanation": "valves presents to the outpatient department (OPD). The most appropriate management for this condition is endoscopic ablation. This procedure involves using a cystoscope to remove or ablate the obstructive valve tissue, thereby relieving the obstruction and improving urine flow. Incorrect Options: Option B - Dilation of urethra: Dilation involves stretching the urethra to relieve obstruction. However, this is not suitable for treating PUV because the obstruction is caused by a valve rather than a stenotic segment. Dilation does not address the underlying problem of the valve. Option C - Dilation of urethra and bladder: While dilation of the urethra might alleviate some symptoms, it does not address the underlying issue of PUV. Additionally, bladder dilation is not a standard treatment for PUV and does not effectively manage the obstruction. Option D - Conservative: Conservative management may include monitoring and supportive care, but it does not resolve the obstruction caused by PUV. This approach is not adequate for managing the condition, as it fails to address the cause of the urinary obstruction. Reference: .",

      "correct_answer": "D",
      "explanation": "along with RBCs, strongly suggests cystinuria, a genetic disorder that leads to the formation of cystine stones. These stones are rare and are caused by the poor reabsorption of cystine in the kidneys, leading to its crystallization in urine. The recurrent colicky abdominal pain is typical of urolithiasis. Incorrect Options: Option A - Glomerulonephritis: This condition involves inflammation of the glomeruli in the kidneys and typically presents with hematuria, proteinuria, and sometimes RBC casts, but not with benzene-shaped crystals. Option B - Oxalate stone: Calcium oxalate stones are common and may present with similar symptoms, but they are characterized by envelope-shaped crystals in the urine, not benzene-shaped crystals. Option C - Polycystic kidney disease: This genetic disorder leads to the development of multiple cysts in the kidneys and can cause hematuria, hypertension, and renal failure. However, it does not cause the formation of benzene-shaped crystals in the urine. Reference: .",

      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "cord twists, cutting off the blood supply to the testicle. If untreated for several hours, this can lead to gangrene due to ischemia. The history of trauma and rapid onset of pain, along with surgical findings, strongly suggest testicular torsion with gangrene. Incorrect Options: Option B - Torsion of testicular appendages with gangrene: Torsion of testicular appendages, such as the appendix testis, is less common and usually presents with localized pain. While it can cause significant discomfort, it typically does not lead to the severe ischemia and gangrene seen in testicular torsion. Blue dot sign: torsion of appendage of testis Option C - Gangrene: Gangrene refers to tissue death due to loss of blood supply. In this context, the term alone is nonspecific, and without the identification of an underlying cause, such as testicular torsion, it does not fully describe the condition. Option D - Hematoma: A hematoma can occur due to trauma, leading to localized swelling and pain. However, it would not typically present with the severe ischemic changes seen in testicular torsion unless associated with vascular injury.",

It is used to visualize the bladder and urethra through the urethra, allowing for the insertion of various tubes or instruments for diagnostic or therapeutic purposes. Incorrect Options: Option A - Nephroscope: This instrument is specifically used to visualize and treat conditions within the kidney. It is typically employed for procedures such as percutaneous nephrolithotomy (PCNL) to remove kidney stones. It is not used for inserting tubes into the urinary tract. Option C - Ureteroscope : This instrument is used to visualize and treat conditions within the ureters (the tubes connecting the kidneys to the bladder). It is used for procedures such as ureteroscopy to remove stones or diagnose issues in the ureters, but not typically for inserting a tube into the urinary tract. Option D - Endoscope: While endoscopes are used for visualizing internal body structures, they are not specific to the urinary tract.

It is done in cases of T3 lesion of tumor but no enlarged or visible lymph nodes as Elective prophylactic lymph node dissection.If superficial lymph nodes becomes positive ,then must go for deep inguinal lymph nodes dissection. Incorrect Options: Option D - Penectomy with Deep Inguinal Lymph Node Dissection: This approach is done with nodal positive cases as Therapeutic lymph node dissection.In this case 1st superficial lymph nodes must be dissected ,if becomes positive go for deep inguinal lymph nodes dissection. Option A - Penectomy: This procedure involves the surgical removal of the penis. While it addresses the primary tumor, it does not account for potential metastasis to the lymph nodes, which is critical in the management of penile cancer, especially with a T3 lesion indicating a more advanced stage. Option B - Penectomy with Orchidectomy: This involves the removal of the penis along with the testicles. Orchidectomy is sometimes performed if there is a suspicion of testicular involvement or if the cancer is considered to be related to testicular issues. However, in the absence of evidence of testicular involvement or enlarged lymph nodes, this approach might be excessive and does not specifically address potential regional lymph node metastasis. .

This condition can cause scrotal swelling, which may be painful or uncomfortable and occasionally accompanied by fever. Hydrocele: Collection of fluid between the two layers of the tunica vaginalis of the testis Aetiology Defective absorption of fluid by tunica vaginalis due to endothelial wall damage by low-grade infection Excessive production of fluid (secondary hydrocele) Interference with drainage of fluid by lymphatic vessels of the cord Communication with the peritoneal cavity Primary Vaginal Hydrocele Common in middle-aged men, prevalent in tropical countries Testis is usually large and non-palpable Fluctuant Can get above the swelling Initially transilluminant, but becomes non-transilluminant if long-standing Infantile Hydrocele Tunica and processus vaginalis distended up to the internal ring No connection with the peritoneal cavity Congenital Hydrocele Processus vaginalis communicates with the peritoneal cavity Fluid disappears when lying down and recollects when standing Encysted Hydrocele of the Cord Fluid collection in a portion of the patent funicular process of tunica vaginalis Fluctuant and transilluminant Located in the inguinal/inguinoscrotal/scrotal part Secondary Vaginal Hydrocele Causes: Infection (filariasis, tuberculosis), injury (trauma, post herniorrhaphy), tumor (malignancy) Usually small, lax, and testis is palpable except in cases of filariasis where it can be very large Surgical Procedure Lord's plication - small, thin hydrocele with clear fluid Jaboulay's operation - partial sac removal and eversion Incorrect Options: Varicocele (Option A) involves dilation of the pampiniform plexus of veins and typically presents as a soft, irregular mass that may feel like a \"bag of worms.\" It is usually asymptomatic, though it can sometimes cause pain or infertility. Cystocele (Option C) refers to the prolapse of the bladder into the vaginal canal and is not related to scrotal swelling. Torsion testis (Option D) is a surgical emergency caused by twisting of the spermatic cord, leading to compromised blood flow to the testis.

      "explanation": "Correct Answer: D) Leydig cell tumor Explanation: Leydig cell tumors are the most likely diagnosis in this case. These tumors often present with gynecomastia due to the production of estrogens, as they secrete both testosterone and estrogen. The patient's elevated serum sex hormones suggests Leydig cell tumors. Sex cord-stromal tumours have two major subtypes: Leydig cell and Sertoli cell tumour. Leydig cell tumour Sertoli cell tumour Hormonal involvement It often involves androgens, oestrogens, and corticosteroids. Hormonally silent. Conditions associated with Klinefelter syndrome. Cryptorchidism. Renal cell carcinoma. Carney complex. Peutz-Jeghers syndrome. Familial adenomatous polyposis. Malignancy 10% (in adults) 10% Gross Circumscribed nodules, usually < 5 cm in diameter. They have a distinctive golden brown, homogeneous appearance on cut surfaces. Firm, small nodules with a homogeneous grey-white to yellow cut surface. Histology The tumour cells resemble their normal counterparts. They are large in size and have round or polygonal cell outlines , abundant granular eosinophilic cytoplasm , and a round central nucleus. The cytoplasm frequently contains lipid droplets , vacuoles , or lipofuscin pigment and, most characteristically, rod-shaped Reinke crystalloids (25% of the tumours). The tumour cells are arranged in distinctive trabeculae that tend to form cord-like structures and tubules. Image Incorrect Options: Spermatocytic tumors (Option A) are typically benign and present with a painless testicular mass. They are usually diagnosed in older men (over 50 years of age) and are characterised by a slow-growing mass & do not secrete any hormones. Sertoli cell tumours (Option B) mostly present as painless testicular masses. They are hormonally silent but sometimes produce estrogen & are less commonly associated with elevated estradiol levels compared to Leydig cell tumors. The presence of gynaecomastia along with increased testosterone makes Leydig cell tumour more likely. Granulosa cell tumours (Option C) are more commonly seen in females and are extremely rare in males. They usually present as slow-growing and non-functioning testicular mass.",

Clinical Features of Renal Cell Carcinoma (RCC): Classic symptoms such as hematuria, flank pain, and a palpable abdominal mass - “ TOO - LATE” TRIAD seen in 10% of patients with advanced disease. Systemic symptoms like weight loss, fever, and fatigue can also occur. In advanced stages, RCC may metastasise to the lungs, bones, and brain. A non-reducing varicocele, referred to as a suspicious varicocele , may indicate the presence of renal cell carcinoma (RCC), often due to a thrombus originating from the left RCC. Treatment of RCC: RCCs are radio and chemo-resistant. Surgical Management: Partial Nephrectomy (Option A): Involves removing only the tumour while preserving the remainder of the kidney. Indications: T1 Disease(<7cm) Restricted to poles RCC in solitary functioning kidney Radical Nephrectomy: Involves removal of the kidney with Gerota’s fascia, para-aortic nodes, and ureter up to the pelvic brim. Indications: Larger tumours or when partial nephrectomy is not feasible Ablative Techniques Radiofrequency Ablation (RFA) and Cryoablation Involve destroying the tumor using extreme temperatures. Indications: Patients who are not surgical candidates Patients with small tumours (T1a lesions) (usually <4 cm). Systemic Therapy (For advanced/ metastatic disease) Targeted Therapy Tyrosine kinase inhibitors (e.g., sunitinib, pazopanib) mTOR inhibitors (e.g., everolimus) Immunotherapy: Immune checkpoint inhibitors (e.g., nivolumab) Reference: Sabiston Textbook of Surgery, 20th Edition, Page 2091, 2092 Bailey & Love's Short Practice of Surgery, 28th Edition, Page 1482",

The most common cause of urethral stricture is trauma , often due to external forces like an external blow , kick , or straddle injuries (e.g., falling onto a hard object like a manhole). Bulbar urethral injury falls under anterior urethral injury , and retrograde urethrogram (RGU) is the investigation of choice for such injuries. However, both RGU and MCU are often performed in emergency cases. Male Urethra: Fibromuscular tube extending from the bladder neck to the meatus and functions to transport urine and semen. Posterior urethra: Prostatic urethra and membranous urethra. Anterior urethra : Bulbar urethra, Penile urethra, and Urethral meatus. Urethral Meatus : Vertical slit-like opening at the tip of the glans penis. Glandular Urethra, also known as the fossa navicularis. Penile Urethra : Extends from the meatus to the penoscrotal junction. The longest part of the urethra Bulbar Urethra : Extends from the penoscrotal junction to the bulbomembranous junction. Membranous Urethra : Extends from the bulbomembranous junction to the verumontanum. The shortest, narrowest, and least dilated part is innervated by the pudendal nerve from spinal segments S2-4.

Cystoscopy is a minimally invasive procedure that involves inserting a thin tube with a camera (cystoscope) into the urinary tract to visualize and potentially remove foreign bodies or stones. This option seems reasonable if the imaging has revealed the presence of a foreign body in the urinary tract and it's contributing to the patient's symptoms. Cystoscopic retrieval is a less invasive approach compared to open surgery. Incorrect Options: Option A - Laparotomy to remove the stones: Laparotomy involves making a surgical incision in the abdominal wall to access the internal organs. It is generally not the first-line approach for kidney stone removal. Kidney stones can often be managed through less invasive methods such as lithotripsy or endoscopic procedures.",

      "correct_answer": "D",
      "explanation": "bladder. This option is the most appropriate choice based on the patient's history of working in a dye factory, urinary complaints, and findings of thickened and irregular bladder walls. Exposure to certain chemicals, such as those used in dye factories, can increase the risk of bladder cancer. The presentation suggests a potential malignancy, and radical cystectomy is a definitive treatment for invasive bladder cancer that hasn't responded to more conservative treatments. It involves removing the bladder along with nearby lymph nodes and, in some cases, other adjacent organs. This procedure is reserved for cases where the cancer has invaded the bladder wall or has a high likelihood of spreading. Incorrect Options: Option A - Instillation of BCG: Bacillus Calmette-Guérin (BCG) instillation is a treatment commonly used for superficial bladder cancer and not for urinary complaints related to thickened and irregular bladder walls. BCG is a type of immunotherapy that helps stimulate the immune system to fight cancer cells. It is not appropriate for this patient's presentation. Option B - Cystoscopy with Tumor Removal: While cystoscopy with tumor removal is indicated for patients with bladder tumors or suspected bladder cancer, this patient's presentation of urinary complaints, thickened, and irregular bladder walls is not indicative of a tumor. Therefore, this option is not the most appropriate management for this patient.

      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: C) Renal angiomyolipoma Explanation: The presence of hematuria and a neovascular mass in the left kidney on a CT scan suggests a benign renal tumor, likely Renal Angiomyolipoma (AML) . Arise from Perivascular epithelioid cells Types Sporadic AMLs: Present in the 4th-6th decades, typically small, solitary, and slow-growing. TSC-associated AMLs: Present earlier (3rd-4th decades), larger, multiple, bilateral, and tend to grow. Symptoms Abdominal or flank pain, hematuria, hypertension, anemia. Impaired kidney function, usually due to hemorrhage (severe complication). Wunderlich syndrome : Nontraumatic kidney hemorrhage. Risk Factors for AML Complications Pregnancy: Increased risk of hemorrhage TSC-associated AMLs: Higher risk of CKD and ESKD Epithelioid AMLs: Potential for malignant transformation, metastasis, and local recurrence. Risk factors for hemorrhage: AML size (>6 cm) Increased vascularity Large intralesional aneurysms (>5 mm) Exophytic growth pattern. Histology Circular blood vessels, muscles, and fat; perivascular epithelioid cells with dense eosinophilic cytoplasm and mitotic figures. Diagnosis CT: (Investigation of choice) Presence of intralesional fat and neovascular mass. USG: Appears as hyperechoic Immunocytochemical analysis: Differentiates AML from RCC, using markers like HMB-45 and melan-A . Treatment Observation (tumors <4 cm) Nephron-Sparing Surgery(Partial nephrectomy) (larger tumors or those with a high risk of bleeding) Angioembolization (acute hemorrhage). Medications (mTOR inhibitors like everolimus and sirolimus). Renal cell carcinoma (RCC) (Option A) is a malignant tumor of the kidney that appears as a solid, heterogeneous mass with irregular borders and necrosis. While it shows neovascularization, it lacks the fat component and distinct vascular pattern of angiomyolipomas (AMLs). The presence of these benign features suggests AML, not RCC. Renal",

Management of Inguinal Hernia Surgical Approaches: Herniotomy : It involves excising and closing the hernia sac Primarily used in children with lateral hernias and congenital hydrocele. In adults, herniotomy alone is insufficient due to high recurrence rates. (Option A ruled out) Hernioplasty : Includes herniotomy plus inguinal floor reconstruction with mesh (preferred in adults). (Option B) Indications: Direct hernia Recurrent hernia, Re-recurrent hernia lncisional hernia Old age Hernia with weak abdominal muscle tone Sliding hernia. Herniorrhaphy : Includes herniotomy plus reconstruction of the inguinal floor with sutures Techniques: Bassini's Repair: Involves suturing the internal oblique, transversus abdominis, and fascia transversalis to the inguinal ligament. Known as a triple-layer repair. Higher recurrence rates. Shouldice Repair: involves a four-layer repair (double breasting of fascia transversalis), resulting in lower recurrence rates compared to Bassini's. Modified Shouldice : A six-layer repair, including additional layers for reinforcement. Anterior Tension-Free Repair: Lichtenstein Repair : Utilizes a mesh to reinforce the inguinal floor, which is considered the gold standard due to lower recurrence rates and faster recovery.

Horseshoe Kidney It is a congenital condition in which the two kidneys are fused at the lower ends, forming a U-shaped structure. Cause During fetal development the kidneys fuse at their lower poles, forming a U-shaped structure. This fusion results in the inferior mesenteric artery preventing the ascent of the isthmus of the kidney to its normal position in the abdomen, leading to an abnormal location lower in the abdomen. Clinical Features Mostly asymptomatic. Pain: due to obstruction or renal stones. Recurrent urinary tract infections (UTIs) Hydronephrosis Hematuria Rovsing's syndrome: Hyperextension of the spine- nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain. Investigation CT Angiography (CT Angio): This is the investigation of choice for diagnosing a horseshoe kidney, as it allows for detailed visualization of the renal anatomy, the abnormal vascular supply, and associated complications. CT Abdomen showing Horseshoe kidney Contrast-Enhanced CT (CECT): Used when CT Angio is not available Intravenous Pyelogram (IVP) - characteristic findings include : Medial Orientation of Calyces: Referred to as the \" Hand Joining Sign .\" High Insertion of Ureters with Anterior Transposition: This creates a \"Flower Vase\" appearance of the ureters.

Characterized by: Ectopic ventrally located urethral meatus, Ventral penile curvature (chordee), Incomplete dorsal hood prepuce. Classification/Types: Glanular Hypospadias: Most common type Coronal Hypospadias Penile Hypospadias Penoscrotal Hypospadias Perineal Hypospadias Scrotal Hypospadias Distal penile Hypospadias Hypospadias Repair Steps De-gloving → Orthoplasty → Urethroplasty → Meatoplasty → Glanuloplasty → Penoplasty → Scrotoplasty Degloving : Removal of the penile skin to expose the underlying structures. (Statement 2) Orthoplasty : Correction of penile curvature and any associated penile shaft issues. This step involves mobilising and repositioning the urethral plate if necessary. (Statement 3) Urethroplasty : Creation or reconstruction of the neourethra using tissue flaps or grafts to form a functional urethra. (Statement 1) Providing vascularised coverage for the urethroplasty. Glanuloplasty : Reconstruction of the glans penis, focusing on creating a normal appearance and aligning the meatus. (Statement 4) Penoplasty : Reconstruction of the penile shaft to restore or enhance its normal appearance and function. This may involve skin flaps or grafts. Scrotoplasty : Correction or reconstruction of the scrotum, which may be necessary if there are associated anomalies or for cosmetic reasons.

Intraperitoneal Bladder Rupture Involves a tear or injury to the peritoneum over the bladder, and urine leaks into the peritoneal cavity in males. Causes Often occurs in a fully distended bladder, usually due to trauma or injury Clinical Features Sudden, severe pain in the suprapubic region. Signs of shock and syncope. Diffuse abdominal pain with later features of peritonitis. Abdominal distension. Haematuria Absence of desire to urinate Diagnosis Plain X-ray: It may show a ground glass appearance. Peritoneal Tap: Used to collect urine from the abdominal cavity. Cystography: Iodine dye is injected via a catheter to visualise bladder tears and the dye entry into the peritoneal cavity. The contrast outlines the bowel loops. Ultrasound: To assess other abdominal injuries. Treatment Emergency Laparotomy is required. (Option C) . Bladder tear is sutured with polylactic acid (vicryl) in two layers. Peritoneal wash to clean out the peritoneal cavity. Separate drainage for prevesical space and peritoneal cavity. Administration of specific antibiotics to prevent sepsis. Catheterisation: Malecot’s catheter is placed suprapubically. Foley's catheter passed urethrally. Complications Cystitis /and pyelonephritis. Peritonitis. Pelvic abscess. Fistula formation (vesicovaginal or rectovesical). Paralytic ileus. Hemorrhage. Suprapubic cystostomy (Option A) is used to divert urine in cases of bladder injuries, but it’s typically considered when there is a lower urinary tract injury, such as bladder rupture without peritoneal involvement. Per Urethral catheterisation (Option B) is performed to assess for urethral injury or urinary retention.",

      "correct_answer": "D",
      "explanation": "Correct answer D) Wait and watch for spontaneous descent within the next 6 months Explanation: Undescended Testis (Cryptorchidism) Definition Cryptorchidism is a condition where one or both testes fail to descend into the scrotum from the abdomen. Locations Inguinal/Palpable undescended testis: 80% Abdominal/Non-Palpable undescended testis: 20% Causes and Associated Conditions Developmental and Genetic Factors: Conditions like Klinefelter syndrome and testosterone imbalances can impair testicular descent. Prematurity and Maternal Factors: Premature birth and maternal issues like diabetes or medication exposure can lead to undescended testes. Mechanical and Physical Factors: Obstructions in the inguinal canal, scrotum, or related conditions such as inguinal hernia can prevent normal testicular descent. Complications (SATHI Mnemonic): S: Sterility - Elevated abdominal temperature can impair sperm production, leading to potential infertility if untreated. A: Atrophy - Prolonged exposure to heat can cause the testis to shrink or become non-functional. T: Trauma, Tumor, Torsion - Increased risk of testicular torsion, which can cause severe pain and potentially result in testicular loss. The most common tumor associated is seminoma with the highest risk of tumor development in abdominal testes. H: Hernia - Over 90% of cases are associated with a patent processus vaginalis, increasing the risk of inguinal hernia. I: Inflammation - The undescended testis is more prone to inflammatory conditions. Note: Leydig cells are unaffected, maintaining secondary sexual characteristics, while Sertoli cells are impaired, affecting spermatogenesis. Diagnosis Palpable undescended testis: Inguinal exploration. Non-Palpable undescended testis: Diagnostic laparoscopy. Imaging: Ultrasound or MRI may be utilized to locate the testis. Treatment Surgical Repositioning (Orchidopexy): Usually performed when the child is between 6-12 months old. (Option D) Types of Orchidopexy Ombridannes Keetley-Torek Stephen-Fowler Ladd & Gross Surgical exploration within 2 weeks (Option A) is not the first step. Karyotyping is needed before surgery to rule out a disorder of sexual development. Perform orchidopexy now (Option B) : Orchidopexy is performed between 6-12 months , but this case requires karyotyping first to rule out DSD before any surgical decision. Wait and watch for spontaneous descent within the next 6 months (Option C): Spontaneous descent may occur in unilateral cryptorchidism , but bilateral cases require urgent evaluation due to the risk of DSD .

      "explanation": "Correct answer A) Hydronephrosis Explanation: Whitaker test Feature Details Definition A urodynamic test that measures the pressure gradient between the renal pelvis and bladder to assess upper urinary tract obstruction. Indications Equivocal cases of upper urinary tract obstruction, PUJ obstruction, post-pyeloplasty evaluation, distinguishing true obstruction from hydronephrosis. Procedure 1. Percutaneous nephrostomy placed in the renal pelvis. 2. Bladder catheter inserted for pressure measurement. 3. Fluid infusion into renal pelvis at 10 ml/min. 4. Pressure difference between renal pelvis & bladder recorded. Interpretation <15 cm H I O → No obstruction. 15–22 cm H I O → Indeterminate (needs further evaluation). >22 cm H I O → Significant obstruction present. Advantages Helps differentiate true obstruction vs. non-obstructive dilation. Useful in post-surgical cases. Limitations Invasive (rarely used due to modern imaging). Replaced by diuretic renal scan (DTPA/EC scan) & MR Urography. Posterior urethral valve (Option B) PUV is a lower urinary tract obstruction (at the urethra), and the Whitaker test assesses upper tract obstruction . Best Test: Voiding Cystourethrogram (VCUG). Urethral atresia Congenital absence of urethral patency (Option C) is usually diagnosed prenatally or at birth. Whitaker test is not needed , as the condition is identified early with fetal ultrasound . Urethral stricture (Option D) Affects the lower urinary tract, while the Whitaker test evaluates upper urinary tract obstruction. Best Test: Retrograde Urethrogram (RUG) or Uroflowmetry.

Location: Since the tumour is large and located in the lower part of the kidney, a partial nephrectomy is not feasible due to a high risk of incomplete resection or complications. No lymph node involvement: There is no evidence of metastasis (N0M0), making surgery the best option. Partial nephrectomy (Option B) Indicated for tumours <7 cm (T1) when feasible. A 10 cm tumour is too large for nephron-sparing surgery. Radiotherapy (Option C) RCC is chemo-resistant . Systemic therapy is considered only for metastatic disease (stage IV).

      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Correct answer C) Renal cell carcinoma Explanation: Renal cell carcinoma is a type of kidney cancer that originates in the cells of the kidney tubules. It commonly presents with symptoms such as persistent back pain, a palpable mass in the lumbar region, fatigue, and hematuria. The presence of RBCs in the urine without pus cells, along with lumbar pain and a ballotable mass, is consistent with renal cell carcinoma. Polycystic kidney disease (Option A) Polycystic kidney disease (PKD) is a genetic disorder characterized by the growth of multiple cysts in the kidneys. It typically presents with symptoms such as abdominal or flank pain, hypertension, and enlarged kidneys. While PKD can cause hematuria (blood in the urine), the presence of a ballotable mass and lumbar pain during inspiration is not commonly associated with PKD. Hydronephrosis (Option B) Hydronephrosis refers to the swelling or enlargement of the kidney due to the buildup of urine caused by an obstruction in the urinary tract. It can result from conditions such as kidney stones, tumours, or structural abnormalities. While hydronephrosis can cause lumbar pain and a ballotable mass in the affected area, the presence of RBCs in the urine without pus cells suggests an alternative diagnosis. Chronic pyelonephritis (Option D) Chronic pyelonephritis is a long-term inflammation of the kidney resulting from recurrent urinary tract infections. It may cause symptoms such as flank pain, fever, frequent urination, and the presence of pus cells in the urine. However, the absence of pus cells and the presence of RBCs in the urine, along with the presence of a ballotable mass, are not typical for chronic pyelonephritis.

Prostate cancer commonly metastasizes to the bones, including the vertebrae, leading to sclerotic (hardened) lesions. Carcinoma Prostate with Bone Metastases: Aspect Details Pathophysiology Prostate cancer spreads hematogenously to bones , commonly affecting the spine, pelvis, ribs, and femur . Metastases are osteoblastic (sclerotic) due to increased osteoblast activity. Common Symptoms Lower back pain , pathological fractures, urinary symptoms (hesitancy, frequency), and neurological deficits if spinal cord compression occurs . Laboratory Findings PSA – Elevated , ALP – Elevated (bone involvement), Serum Calcium – Normal/mildly elevated (osteoblastic metastases do not cause severe hypercalcemia). X-ray Findings Sclerotic (osteoblastic) lesions in vertebrae, pelvis, and long bones. Bone Scan (Tc-99m) Shows increased radiotracer uptake in metastatic sites (best for early detection). MRI Spine Detects spinal cord compression marrow infiltration . CT Pelvis/Spine Defines bone metastases and local spread . Confirmatory Test TRUS-guided prostate biopsy (Transrectal Ultrasound Biopsy). Treatment Androgen Deprivation Therapy (ADT) (GnRH agonists like Leuprolide), Bisphosphonates for bone health , Radiation for spinal metastases , and Surgical decompression if cord compression occurs . Tuberculosis (Option B) Tuberculosis (TB) typically affects the lungs, but it can also involve other organs, including the spine. Spinal tuberculosis, known as Pott's disease, can cause vertebral destruction and collapse, leading to back pain.

      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "Correct answer A) GnRH Analogue Explanation: GnRH analogue increases the level of gonadotropin,s which further increases the level of androgens that help in testicular descent as it is an androgen-dependent process. Testosterone (Option B) GnRH analogue is preferred over testosterone as neonatal gonadotropin therapy can increase the testosterone levels without fear of inducing spermatogenesis or negatively affecting an ultimate number of Sertoli cells (an important determinant of fertility). Cold Compressions (Option C) Cold compresses or ice application is not a recognised method to assist testicular descent in newborns. Manually bring the testis down to the bottom of the scrotum (Option D). This option describes a manual technique called orchidopexy or surgical orchiopexy. It involves surgically bringing the undescended testis down to the scrotum. It is a definitive treatment for undescended testis, but it is typically performed by a healthcare professional and not manually by parents or Caregivers.

Accounts for 50% of all testicular germ cell tumors. 10% have secondary hydrocele, 5% have gynecomastia Diagnostic Markers AFP: Normal hCG: Normal or mildly elevated LDH: Elevated Investigation Ultrasound: Homogeneous, hypoechoic mass Histology: Sheets of oval cells with clear cytoplasm, large nuclei with prominent acidophilic nucleoli FNAC: Contraindicated due to the risk of tumour cell seeding and lymph node metastasis Treatment Primary: High Inguinal Radical Orchidectomy Adjuvant: Radiation therapy or chemotherapy for positive lymph nodes Leydig cell tumour (Option A) : Benign testicular tumour that typically occurs in adults aged 30-60. While it presents as a painless testicular mass, Leydig cell tumours don't typically elevate beta-hCG. Embryonal carcinoma (Option B) : Aggressive germ cell tumour that often occurs in young men. However, it typically presents with both elevated AFP and beta-hCG, not just beta-hCG alone. It's also usually more heterogeneous on ultrasound.

Impotence (Erectile Dysfunction) (Option A) Erection is mainly parasympathetically mediated (S2-S4, pelvic splanchnic nerves), not lumbar sympathetic nerves. Sympathectomy may affect ejaculation but does not typically cause impotence. Bladder Dysfunction (Option C) The main control of bladder function (detrusor contraction, micturition reflex) is via S2-S4 parasympathetic fibers , not L1 sympathetic nerves. Some mild urinary dysfunction may occur , but retrograde ejaculation is more common.

Immediate insertion of Foley's catheter (Option B) inserting a Foley catheter without assessing urethral integrity can lead to further complications. Suprapubic aspiration of urine (Option C) is not the initial management approach in this scenario.

      "explanation": "children. PUV is an abnormal fold of tissue within the urethra that obstructs the flow of urine. It is a congenital condition that occurs during foetal development. PUV can cause various urinary symptoms, such as difficulty urinating, weak urinary stream, urinary tract infections, and urinary retention. It is more commonly seen in male infants. Urethral atresia (Option B) is a rare condition in which the urethra is completely closed or absent. It is a congenital anomaly and can lead to urinary retention and other urinary complications. While urethral atresia can cause bladder outlet obstruction, it is not as common as the posterior urethral valve in male children. Anterior urethral valve (Option C) is a less common condition compared to the posterior urethral valve. It is characterised by abnormal tissue folds or membranes in the anterior portion of the urethra. Anterior urethral valve can cause urinary obstruction and other urinary symptoms, but it is not the most common cause of bladder outlet obstruction in male children. Ureterocele (Option D) is a bulging of the ureter into the bladder. It can obstruct the flow of urine from the affected kidney. While ureterocele can lead to urinary obstruction, it primarily affects the upper urinary tract rather than the bladder outlet.

      },
      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "Correct answer A) Transurethral resection of the tumour Explanation: Transurethral resection of the tumour (TURBT) is the initial standard treatment for low-grade transitional cell carcinoma (TCC) of the bladder. This procedure is performed using a cystoscope inserted through the urethra to remove the tumor from the bladder. TURBT allows for both diagnostic and therapeutic purposes, as the tumor is removed and sent for histopathological examination to confirm the diagnosis and assess the stage and grade of the tumor. Resection with ileal conduit (Option B) is not the ideal management for low-grade transitional cell carcinoma of the bladder. It is typically reserved for cases of invasive or high-grade bladder cancer that cannot be adequately treated with transurethral resection alone. Partial cystectomy with bladder reconstruction (Option C) may be considered particularly if the tumour is in a favourable location and can be completely excised while preserving bladder function. However, transurethral resection is generally the preferred initial treatment for most cases of low-grade bladder cancer. Neoadjuvant chemotherapy (Option D) It is typically used for muscle-invasive bladder cancer or cases with a high risk of progression. Tumor Stage Tis (Carcinoma in situ) TURBT (Transurethral Resection of Bladder Tumor) May be used for initial diagnosis and tumor resection if not already performed Intravesical BCG Induction: Weekly for 6 weeks Maintenance: Weekly for 3 weeks at months 3, 6, 12, 18, 24, 30, and 36 Continue BCG Maintenance Therapy Up to 3 years Ta (Non-muscle invasive) TURBT Complete resection of tumor Low-risk: Single Instillation (SI) of Intravesical Chemotherapy (e.g., gemcitabine, mitomycin) SI within 24 hours of TURBT Alternative: Continuous saline bladder irrigation Intermediate-risk: Intravesical Chemotherapy (e.g., gemcitabine) Induction: 6 weekly courses Maintenance: Up to 1 year T1 (Muscle invasive) TURBT - For initial diagnosis and tumor debulking High-risk: Intravesical BCG Induction: Weekly for 6 weeks Maintenance: Up to 3 years Consider Cystectomy If BCG is not tolerated or ineffective- Alternative: Trimodality therapy (TURBT + Chemoradiation) T2 (Muscle invasive) TURBT - May be used for tumor resection and staging Initial Treatment: Consider Cystectomy Alternatively, Trimodality therapy (TURBT + Chemoradiation) Adjuvant Therapy: Depending on response and tumor characteristics T3 (Advanced muscle invasive) Initial Treatment: Cystectomy with possible neoadjuvant chemotherapy TURBT - Often not performed if cystectomy is planned Adjuvant Therapy: Based on pathology and staging Neoadjuvant therapy may continue T4 (Locally advanced) Initial Treatment: Cystectomy Neoadjuvant Chemotherapy, if not yet administered TURBT - Typically avoided if cystectomy and neoadjuvant therapy are planned Adjuvant Therapy: Additional chemotherapy or radiation based on residual disease and staging Reference: https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-primary-non-muscle-invasive-urothelial-carcinoma-of-t he-bladder?search=bladder%20cancer&sectionRank=1&usage_type=default&anchor=H3412363&source=machi neLearning&selectedTitle=7~150&display_rank=7#H3412363",

Bladder TB: Infection Progression: The infection spreads from the ureter into the bladder, with an early sign observable during cystoscopy being pallor around the ureteric orifice in the bladder. Chronic Inflammation: This inflammation leads to the formation of tubercles in the bladder, followed by fibrosis. Bladder Changes: The fibrosis results in a small, contracted bladder with significantly reduced capacity, often referred to as a \"thimble bladder.\" Advanced TB: In advanced cases, where the bladder is contracted, the ureteric orifices may appear as \"golf hole\" shapes. GUTB involving the prostate: Calcification: The affected area becomes calcified, resulting in a hard and nodular texture. Testis: The testis is usually spared in cases of genitourinary tuberculosis. Characteristic Feature: A distinctive feature of tuberculosis is the \"beaded\" appearance of the vas deferens, often accompanied by multiple discharging sinuses through the scrotum. Investigations: Urine routine and microscopy-pyuria with or without hematuria Urine culture-sterile pyuria IVU clearly shows the effects of GUTB on the urinary tract, such as: The fuzzy or moth-eaten appearance of the calyces due to ulceration.

Management Minor Injuries: Managed conservatively with catheterisation or suprapubic catheter if severe bruising Severe Injuries: Surgical intervention like primary repair, urethroplasty, or end-to-end anastomosis Antibiotics: To prevent infection Initial Management: Suprapubic catheterization for urinary diversion Delayed Urethroplasty (Definitive management): 3-6 months post-injury after inflammation and fibrosis have subsided Primary Realignment: Occasionally attempted if conditions permit Endoscopic Realignment: For selected cases, though often reserved for acute management Complications Urethral stricture (risk of recurrence) Erectile dysfunction (especially if injury near the penile base) Urinary incontinence (less common) Infection (urethritis or abscess formation) Bladder neck contracture Chronic pelvic syndrome Foley’s catheterization (Option A) insertion is avoided in the presence of blood at the urethral meatus, as it may worsen a posterior urethral injury and should be delayed until imaging confirms urethral integrity. Nephrogram (Option C) is not the immediate step for managing urethral injury. Imaging, like a retrograde urethrogram, is important, but the initial evaluation should be followed to stabilise the patient and ensure proper drainage without causing further harm. Suprapubic Cystoscopy (Option D) is for significant urethral injury, retention, or obstruction, but if the injury is mild or unconfirmed, a conservative wait-and-watch approach is preferred to avoid",

      },
      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: C) Ectopic ureter Explanation: Continuous urinary dribbling and persistent bladder fullness since birth are classic symptoms of an ectopic ureter. Ectopic ureter Etiology It results from abnormal embryological development, often associated with ureteral duplication. Pathology Ectopic ureters drain to sites other than the bladder, which is commonly associated with duplication of the ureter. Pathophysiology In females, ectopic ureters open below the urethral sphincter or into the vagina, leading to incontinence . In males, ectopic ureters usually open above the external urethral sphincter, maintaining continence. Types Bilateral ectopic ureters (10% of cases). Unilateral ectopic ureters. Clinical Features Females: Continuous urinary incontinence despite normal voiding. Males: Typically asymptomatic or continent due to ureter opening above the sphincter. Diagnosis Computed Tomo-Urography (CTU). Magnetic Resonance Urography (MRU). Lab Investigations Primarily imaging-based diagnostics (CTU or MRU). Complications Persistent incontinence in females. Potential recurrent urinary tract infections. Differential Diagnosis Vesicoureteral Reflux Urethral Stricture: Difficulty in urination and weak stream, not continuous incontinence. Neurogenic Bladder Treatment Surgical correction: Reposition it into the bladder to restore normal continence. Stress incontinence (Option A) is the involuntary leakage of urine that occurs when there is increased pressure on the bladder, such as during coughing, sneezing, or exercise. It is more common in adults, especially in women, after childbirth or menopause. Ureterocele (Option B) is the congenital dilation of the distal ureter, which forms a cyst-like structure in the bladder wall. This can obstruct urine flow , potentially causing hydronephrosis or recurrent urinary tract infections (UTIs). Vesicovaginal fistula (Option D) is an abnormal communication between the bladder and vagina, typically caused by prolonged obstructed labour. This leads to tissue breakdown and formation of a fistula, resulting in continuous leakage of urine through the vagina.

The image described here is consistent with urethral stricture , where the stricture is located in the penile portion of the urethra. (Option A ruled out) Urethral Stricture Definition Abnormal narrowing of the urethra causes partial or complete obstruction of urine flow, leading to discomfort and severe complications if untreated. Causes Trauma (Most common): Pelvic fractures, falls, accidents, or iatrogenic trauma from prolonged catheterization. Infections: STIs like gonorrhoea and chlamydia cause urethritis. Medical Procedures : Urethral surgeries or radiation for pelvic cancers. Inflammatory Conditions: Chronic inflammation from conditions like lichen sclerosus. Investigations Posterior Urethral Stricture: Micturating Cystourethrogram (MCU) to visualize the posterior urethra and bladder during voiding. (Option C & D ruled out) Anterior Urethral Stricture: Retrograde Urethrogram (RGU). Emergency Evaluation: Both RGU and MCU may be used in trauma cases or acute urinary retention. Management Urethral Dilation: Temporary relief with dilators, often leading to recurrence. Optical Internal Urethrotomy (OIU): Endoscopic incision at the 12 o'clock position; effective for short bulbar strictures (<2 cm). Urethroplasty: Surgical excision and reconstruction; the gold standard for recurrent or complex strictures Strictures up to 2 cm: Excision with end-to-end anastomosis.

      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer B - Bulbar urethra injury Bulbar urethra injury occurs due to trauma to the perineum, especially in cases like falls onto the perineum (e.g., falling into a manhole). The bulbar urethra is the part of the urethra that passes through the perineum, and it is the most commonly injured part in pelvic fractures. Blood at the urethral meatus, along with swelling of the scrotum and penis, points toward this injury. Feature Anterior Urethral Injury Location Bulbar urethra (most common) Penile urethra Common Causes Straddle injuries Direct trauma Iatrogenic injuries (catheterization, cystoscopy) Penetrating trauma (stab/gunshot wounds) Clinical Features Hematuria (blood in urine) Penile/perineal bruising (butterfly-shaped hematoma) Perineal pain Urinary retention or difficulty voiding Possible swelling of the penis or scrotum due to hematoma Investigations Retrograde Urethrography (RGU) : Gold standard , shows the extent and location of injury Voiding Cystourethrography (VCUG): Used to assess urethral patency post-repair Ultrasound: Can detect hematoma or associated injuries Membranous urethra rupture (Option A) is usually identified by a high-riding prostate on digital rectal examination and difficulty voiding. However, the presence of blood at the urethral meatus and swelling of the penis and scrotum, in this case, points to a more distal injury, making membranous rupture unlikely. Prostatic urethra (Option C) injury is uncommon and usually results from high-energy trauma, often involving significant pelvic fractures. The symptoms would be less likely to involve external swelling and blood at the meatus, which suggests of a distal injury. Urinary bladder rupture (Option D) presents with abdominal pain, tenderness, hematuria and inability to pass urine. Blood at the urethral meatus and swelling of the external genitalia are not typical findings for bladder rupture.",

This approach preserves kidney function while removing the tumour, making it the preferred method for small tumours. Treatment of RCC: RCCs are radio and chemo-resistant (Option B & D ruled out) Surgical Management: Partial Nephrectomy (Option A): Involves removing only the tumour while preserving the remainder of the kidney.

      },
      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: A) Increased trabeculations in the bladder Explanation: Increased trabeculations in the bladder are not characteristic features of BPH. Trabeculations refer to irregular muscular bands or folds in the bladder wall, commonly seen in conditions of chronic bladder outlet obstruction , where the bladder muscle hypertrophies due to long-term pressure, but increased trabeculations in the bladder is not commonly seen. Benign Prostate Hyperplasia (BPH) Explanation Age affected: Men over 50 years After 60 years, 50% of men have histological evidence of BPH. Common cause of significant lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS) in men: BPH Common cause of bladder outflow obstruction (BOO) in men more than 70 years of age: BPH Etiopathogenesis Role of hormones in BPH: DHT (Dihydrotestosterone) DHT, derived from testosterone via 5-alpha reductase, binds to androgen receptors in the prostate, promoting cellular proliferation and contributing to prostatic enlargement. Estrogen Estrogen levels increase relative to testosterone in ageing men, influencing prostate growth through the activation of estrogen receptors, particularly ER- α , in the prostatic tissue. Affects both glandular epithelium and connective tissue stroma to variable degrees. Common site of origin Submucosal glands of the periurethral transitional zone Secondary changes in the bladder It is due to increased force of contraction of detrusor muscles): Collagen deposition Detrusor muscle hyperplasia Detrusor muscle hypertrophy. Clinical features Obstructive symptoms: Poor flow/stream Hesitancy Intermittency Incomplete voiding-High post-void residual urine Dribbling of urine Irritative symptoms: Frequency Urgency Nocturia Complications Retention Haematuria Urinary infection Stone formation Hydronephrosis J-shaped/ fish hook proximal ureter (Option B) is a common finding in cases of bladder outlet obstruction, where the increased pressure causes changes in the course of the ureter. J-shaped/ fish hook distal ureters (Option C) is another manifestation of the pressure changes from bladder outlet obstruction, leading to tortuosity or a hook-like appearance in the distal ureters in BPH. Bilateral hydronephrosis (Option D) II refers to the dilatation or swelling of the kidneys caused by the blockage of urine flow from the bladder. BPH can result in bladder outlet obstruction, which leads to urine backing up into the kidneys, ultimately causing hydronephrosis.

Goserelin is a hormonal therapy medication that is a GnRH agonist that works by reducing the levels of testosterone in the body and can help in slowing down the growth of prostate cancer cells. Prostate cancer is testosterone-dependent , and reducing testosterone levels is a critical part of managing advanced or metastatic prostate cancer.

Hence, the statement “lower pole ureter is positioned laterally and cephalad in relation to the upper pole ureter” corresponds with the expected anatomical configuration as per Weigert Meyer's rule. Weigert Meyer's rule explanation: The upper and lower renal moieties each have separate ureters, each with its own orifice in the bladder. The upper renal moiety ureter typically inserts ectopically, medially and inferior to the lower renal moiety ureter, often leading to a ureterocele. The lower renal moiety ureter inserts orthotopically , laterally, and superiorly to the upper moiety's ureter, which has a risk of vesicoureteral reflux.

      "explanation": "Correct Answer: A) This is a typical case of extraperitoneal bladder rupture Explanation: The patient experienced a blow to the distended bladder, resulting in sudden severe pain in the hypogastrium associated with syncope and subsequently, the abdomen began to distend, indicating leakage of urine into the extraperitoneal space. These findings are consistent with extraperitoneal bladder rupture, which occurs when the bladder wall is disrupted but the peritoneal lining remains intact. Extra peritoneal bladder rupture Definition It occurs when the bladder wall is disrupted, but the peritoneal lining remains intact, often due to trauma. Investigations (Option B ruled out) CT cystography reveals characteristic features like a flame-shaped appearance, pear sign & teardrop appearance. Retrograde cystography is the imaging modality of choice for diagnosing bladder ruptures, including extraperitoneal injuries. Extravasation of contrast limited to the perivesical space is a key finding that helps differentiate extraperitoneal from intraperitoneal ruptures, where contrast would outline bowel loops. Management Initial management: Urethral catheterisation with free bladder drainage for 10-14 days. Followed by a cystogram to confirm healing before catheter removal. If the injury is iatrogenic: Repair during the same procedure (open or laparoscopic). Repair done in two layers using 2/0 vicryl absorbable sutures (Option C ruled out) Bladder injury with pelvic fracture: The bladder should be repaired at the same time during the surgery for pelvic fracture. Immediate surgical repair is indeed indicated in cases where there are complicating factors like intravesical bone spicules, bladder neck injuries , or associated vaginal or rectal lacerations.

Additionally, the PSA in BPH is usually mildly elevated but not to the degree seen in prostate cancer. Carcinoma bladder (Option B) can cause urinary symptoms like hematuria, dysuria, or obstructive voiding symptoms, but it is less likely to cause osteoblastic changes in the bones, and the PSA elevation is also not characteristic of bladder cancer.

      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: A) A suprapubic catheter should be inserted as soon as possible. Explanation: The initial course of action for a patient with a pelvic fracture and ruptured membranous urethra is to insert a suprapubic catheter for urinary diversion. By placing a suprapubic catheter, urine can be diverted from the injured urethra, ensuring proper bladder drainage. This helps prevent urinary retention, minimises the risk of urinary extravasation, and reduces further damage to the urethra. Suprapubic catheterisation is considered a temporary solution to manage urine drainage until definitive treatment, such as urethral repair, can be performed. Membranous urethral rupture is a type of Posterior Urethral Injury. The posterior urethra consists of the prostatic urethra and membranous urethra , and injuries in this region are often caused by pelvic fractures , particularly from high-energy trauma like motor vehicle accidents. Investigations, Management & Complications of Posterior Urethral Injuries Investigations Retrograde Urethrography (RGU): Gold standard for initial assessment CT Urethrography : Useful in evaluating complex injuries Pelvic CT Scan: Important for associated pelvic fractures Cystoscopy: Sometimes performed for further evaluation If injury at Prostatomembranous junction - High lying prostate → On IVP- Pie in-sky appearance Management Initial Management: Suprapubic catheterisation for urinary diversion Delayed Urethroplasty (Definitive management): 3-6 months post-injury after inflammation and fibrosis have subsided (Option B ruled out) Primary Realignment: Occasionally attempted if conditions permit Endoscopic Realignment: For selected cases, though often reserved for acute management Complications Urethral stricture (most common long-term complication) Urinary incontinence (due to sphincter damage) Erectile dysfunction (common due to injury near neurovascular structures) Bladder neck contracture Chronic pelvic syndrome IVP (Option B) can be useful for evaluating the urinary tract, but it is not the initial step in the management of a ruptured urethra . The patient should be stabilised first, with urinary diversion (via suprapubic catheter), before any imaging studies are done. MCU should be done (Option D): Micturating Cystourethrogram is an imaging study that evaluates the urethra and bladder during voiding. While it may be helpful in assessing the extent of a urethral injury, it is not the first step in management. The priority is to manage the patient's urinary diversion and stabilise them before any imaging studies are performed.

      "explanation": "Correct Answer: B) Ureterocoele Explanation: The cobra head appearance in IVP is most characteristic of ureterocoele , where there is a cystic dilation of the distal ureter at its insertion into the bladder. Ureterocele is the congenital dilation of the distal ureter within the bladder wall. It can obstruct urine flow, leading to recurrent UTIs and hydronephrosis. Treatment often involves surgical correction to relieve the obstruction. Ureterocoele Types Simple Ureterocele (Intravesical - 20%): Found entirely within the bladder and associated with a single ureter. It is less complex and easier to manage. Ectopic Ureterocele (80%) : Extends beyond the bladder and often involves a duplicated ureter. This is more complicated due to its location, which may involve the bladder, neck, or urethra. Etiology Congenital anomaly is caused by an obstruction in the development of the distal ureter during fetal growth, leading to cystic dilation at the ureteral orifice. Clinical Features Recurrent Urinary Tract Infections (UTIs)/ Urosepsis. Unilateral Hydroureteronephrosis.

      "explanation": "Correct Answer: B) Horseshoe kidney Explanation: The most likely condition, based on the provided options and typical CT findings, is Horseshoe kidney . It is a congenital anomaly where the two kidneys are fused at their lower poles, forming a “U” or \"horseshoe\" shape. Horseshoe kidney Causes During fetal development, the kidneys fuse at their lower poles, forming a U-shaped structure. This fusion results in the inferior mesenteric artery preventing the ascent of the isthmus of the kidney to its normal position in the abdomen, leading to an abnormal location lower in the abdomen. Clinical features Mostly asymptomatic. Pain: due to obstruction or renal stones. Recurrent urinary tract infections (UTIs). Hydronephrosis. Hematuria Rovsing's syndrome: Hyperextension of the spine- nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain. Investigations CT Angiography (CT Angio): This is the investigation of choice for diagnosing a horseshoe kidney, as it allows for detailed visualisation of the renal anatomy, the abnormal vascular supply, and associated complications. Contrast-Enhanced CT (CECT): Used when CT Angio is not available Intravenous Pyelogram (IVP) - characteristic findings include : Medial Orientation of Calyces: Referred to as the \" Hand Joining Sign.\" High Insertion of Ureters with Anterior Transposition: This creates a \"Flower Vase\" appearance of the ureters. Treatment Treatment depends on the presence and severity of symptoms: Asymptomatic Patients: Typically do not require treatment but should be monitored periodically.

      "explanation": "Correct Answer: A) Peyronie’s disease Explanation: The patient described in the scenario, experiencing intense pain during erection and a deviated penis for the past six months, is most likely suffering from Peyronie’s disease . Peyronie’s disease Definition It is characterised by fibrous plaques in the tunica albuginea of the penis, causing abnormal curvature during erections. Characteristics Plaque Location: Typically on the dorsolateral aspect of the penis. Curvature: Resulting from plaque contraction. Causes Trauma/Injury: Repeated minor trauma to the penis. Genetic Factors: Possible genetic predisposition. Connective Tissue Disorders: Associated with conditions like Dupuytren’s contracture. Associated Conditions Galezia’s Triad: Dupuytren’s Contracture: Thickening and shortening of connective tissue in fingers. Retroperitoneal Fibrosis: Fibrosis in the retroperitoneal space. Peyronie’s Disease Clinical Features Painful Erection Erectile Dysfunction Penile Curvature Palpable Plaques Impotence & Infertility (in severe cases) Treatment Observation: Spontaneous Resolution: Often improves without treatment. Medical Management: Oral Medications: Pentoxifylline, colchicine, vitamin E (efficacy varies). Surgical Intervention (If Spontaneous Resolution Does Not Occur): Nesbit Operation: Placement of a non-absorbable suture opposite the plaque to correct the curvature. Plication Surgery: Shortens the longer side of the penis. Plaque Excision and Grafting: Removes plaque and replaces it with graft material. Penile Prosthesis: For severe cases. Priapism (Option B) is a condition where a prolonged and often painful erection occurs unrelated to sexual stimulation. It is typically unrelated to penile curvature and is caused by abnormal blood flow in the penis, leading to stagnant blood in the erectile tissues. It is considered a urological emergency and requires immediate medical attention. Marion’s disease (Option C) is also known as bladder neck stenosis or primary bladder neck obstruction (PBNO). Marion described diseases affecting the bladder and neck as causing urinary disturbances resembling those caused by prostate enlargement. However, these disturbances result from changes in the bladder neck itself, without any visible abnormalities. Erectile dysfunction (Option D) is the inability to achieve or maintain an erection sufficient for sexual intercourse. It is not associated with pain or penile curvature. In some cases, pain or discomfort may accompany an erection, but it is not the primary symptom of ED.",

      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: B) Hyponatremia Explanation: The patient is experiencing altered sensitivity and drowsiness 3 days after undergoing TURP (Transurethral Resection of the Prostate) , raising suspicion for hyponatremia as the most likely diagnosis. TURP Syndrome is a complication that can occur after a TURP procedure, which results from excessive absorption of irrigating fluids during the surgery, leading to hyponatremia , fluid overload , and a variety of systemic symptoms. TURP Syndrome Pathophysiology It is because fluid is absorbed intravascularly due to high volumes of hypotonic irrigation fluid used during the resection, causing dilutional hyponatremia and various neurologic symptoms. Risk factors Size of prostate > 75g Duration of surgery > 90 minutes Pre-existing hyponatremia Renal failure Clinical presentation Confusion, Agitation, Nervousness, Nausea, Hemolysis, Visual disturbances, Coma and shock. Treatment Drug of choice: IV furosemide. Mild to moderate cases: IV furosemide and normal saline Severe or symptomatic patients: IV 3% Saline Fluid restriction: Useful after initial stabilisation and correction of severe hyponatremia to prevent further fluid overload. Hypernatremia (Option A) symptoms include thirst , muscle twitching , muscle weakness, seizures and confusion . It is less likely in this case since the patient is experiencing drowsiness , which is more characteristic of hyponatremia . Stroke (Option C) can present with altered consciousness or neurological deficits such as hemiparesis or aphasia . However, stroke symptoms typically present suddenly and are not typically related to a postoperative time frame of 3 days. The timing of the symptoms makes a stroke less likely unless there is a specific underlying vascular issue. Hyponatremia is a more common cause of these symptoms after TURP. Meningitis due to spinal anaesthesia (Option D) is a rare complication, with symptoms including fever , headache , neck stiffness, nausea, vomiting and photophobia . The timing of the symptoms (3 days after surgery) is not typical for spinal meningitis . Also, the given symptoms align more with hyponatremia .

      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "options: Endometrial biopsy: While endometrial biopsy can be useful in diagnosing genital TB, it is an invasive procedure and may not be the first-line investigation. Endometrial biopsy is typically considered when other less invasive tests, such as PCR testing, have not provided a conclusive diagnosis or when there is a strong clinical suspicion of genital TB. Urine sample for acid-fast bacilli (AFB) culture: Urine sample for AFB culture is essential in diagnosing genitourinary TB, but it may not be the early investigation of choice for genital TB. Genitourinary TB can involve the kidneys, bladder, and ureters, leading to the presence of mycobacteria in the urine. However, when specifically investigating for genital TB, other tests like PCR are more targeted and less invasive. Genital swab for polymerase chain reaction (PCR) testing: This is the correct option. PCR testing is a sensitive and specific method to detect the presence of Mycobacterium tuberculosis DNA in genital samples. PCR testing allows for the rapid identification of TB infection in the genital tract and can be an early investigation of choice. It is less invasive compared to procedures like endometrial biopsy and provides a targeted approach to diagnosing genital TB. Chest X-ray: While a chest X-ray is useful for diagnosing pulmonary TB (TB affecting the lungs), it may not be the primary investigation for genital TB. Genital TB is a specific form of extrapulmonary TB, and although pulmonary TB can be associated with genital TB, direct investigation of the genital tract is needed for a definitive diagnosis. Endometrial biopsy involves obtaining a tissue sample from the lining of the uterus (endometrium) for pathological examination. In cases of suspected genital TB, endometrial biopsy can reveal granulomatous inflammation, caseating necrosis, or acid-fast bacilli, which are indicative of TB infection. It provides direct evidence of TB involvement in the genital tract. Reference: .",

      "explanation": "(benign prostatic hyperplasia or BPH) in which which include difficulty urinating (hesitation, dribbling, weak stream, and incomplete bladder emptying), painful urination, and urinary frequency and urgency. Incorrect Options: Option A - TURP (Transurethral resection of prostate): TURP is a surgical procedure performed to treat moderate to severe urinary symptoms caused by BPH. TURP is not typically used in the initial stage of BPH when the symptoms are mild. It is usually considered when conservative measures and medication have not provided adequate relief or when there are complications associated with BPH. Option C - Finasteride: Finasteride works by inhibiting the conversion of testosterone to dihydrotestosterone (DHT). While finasteride is effective in managing BPH symptoms and can provide long-term benefits, it is not typically the initial choice for managing urinary symptoms in the early stages of BPH. It may be considered for patients with larger prostate volumes or those at a higher risk of disease progression. Option D - Observation: Observation may be an option for patients with mild urinary symptoms that do not significantly affect their quality of life. In such cases, regular monitoring, lifestyle modifications (such as limiting fluid intake before bedtime), and periodic follow-up with a healthcare provider may be recommended. However, if the symptoms worsen or become bothersome, medical intervention with medication, such as tamsulosin, is usually recommended. Observation alone is not considered the standard initial management strategy for urinary symptoms caused by BPH. Reference: Prepladder Notes",

Enuresis: Involuntary leakage of urine that occurs during sleep. Frequency : The need to urinate frequently, often more than 8 times a day. Nocturia - is the complaint that the individual needs to wake at night at least once to void. Urge incontinence (UI) is involuntary urinary leakage, often large volume, immediately preceded by the sensation of urgency. Urgency and episodes of urge incontinence are often associated with an overactive bladder or bladder neuropathy. Voiding symptoms refer to the symptoms related to the emptying of bladder and include the following : Hesitancy: Difficulty initiating urination, often characterized by a delay in the start of the urinary stream Dribbling: A continued leakage of urine after the urinary stream has stopped. Intermittency is the term used when the individual describes urine flow which stops and starts, on one or more occasions, during micturition.

The most common symptoms of bladder tuberculosis are increased frequency of micturition, dysuria, and hematuria. In advanced cases, patients may also experience suprapubic pain, urinary incontinence, and bladder dysfunction. The pale ureteric orifice seen on cystoscopy is a typical finding in patients with bladder tuberculosis, indicating that the mucosa around the orifice is inflamed and edematous. The KUB x-ray may show calcification in the bladder wall, which is a characteristic finding in bladder tuberculosis. Incorrect Options: Option A - Bladder carcinoma: Bladder carcinoma is a malignant tumor that arises from the epithelial cells lining the urinary bladder. It can also present with similar symptoms, such as hematuria and urinary frequency. However, the pale ureteric orifice seen on cystoscopy is not a typical finding in these conditions. Option B - Schistosomiasis : Schistosomiasis is a parasitic infection caused by Schistosoma haematobium that can affect the urinary tract and cause bladder inflammation and fibrosis.

      },
      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "episodic headache, sweating episodes, and a small left-sided suprarenal mass suggest a possible diagnosis of pheochromocytoma. Pheochromocytoma is a rare tumor of the adrenal gland tumor that produces excessive amounts of catecholamines (epinephrine, norepinephrine, and dopamine), which can cause symptoms such as hypertension, headache, and sweating. Among the various blood and urine tests, measuring urinary vanillyl mandelic acid (VMA) levels is a commonly used and highly sensitive test for pheochromocytoma. Incorrect Options: Option B - Blood 5-HIAA levels: 5-HIAA (5-5-hydroxy indole acetic acid) is a breakdown product of serotonin produced by carcinoid tumors. While carcinoid tumors can also produce catecholamines, they are much less common than pheochromocytomas. Thus, measuring blood 5-HIAA levels is not useful for confirming the diagnosis of pheochromocytoma. Option C - Urine myoglobin: Myoglobin is a protein found in muscle tissue, and its presence in urine can indicate muscle damage or injury. However, urine myoglobin levels are not specific for pheochromocytoma and do not help confirm the diagnosis. Option D - Stool trypsin levels: Stool trypsin levels can be used to diagnose pancreatic insufficiency, a condition where the pancreas does not produce enough enzymes to digest food properly. However, this test is not relevant for diagnosing pheochromocytoma. Reference: Prepladder Notes",

      "explanation": "bladder cancer. If a patient receives chemotherapy and radiation therapy, the dose of gemcitabine may need to be reduced to avoid increased toxicity. This is because radiation therapy can affect the body's ability to metabolize and eliminate the chemotherapy drug. Radiation can increase the levels of gemcitabine in the body, leading to increased side effects such as low white blood cell counts, nausea, and fatigue. Therefore, the dose of gemcitabine may need to be reduced with radiation therapy. Incorrect Options: Option A - Cisplatin: Cisplatin is another chemotherapy drug used to treat bladder cancer. While it can also cause toxicity when given radiation therapy, the question specifically asks about the drug for which the dose should be reduced, and the correct answer is gemcitabine. Option C - Paclitaxel: Paclitaxel is a chemotherapy drug used to treat various cancers but not commonly used to treat bladder cancer. Additionally, no evidence suggests that the paclitaxel dose should be reduced with radiation therapy. Option D - Ifosfamide: Ifosfamide is another chemotherapy drug used to treat bladder cancer.

In such cases, there is no further intervention required as the finding suggests that no viable testis is present. However, it is important to document the absence or atrophy of the testis and discuss the findings with the patient and their family. Incorrect Options: Option A - Inguinal exploration : Inguinal exploration involves surgical exploration of the inguinal canal to locate and bring down the undescended testis. However, in this scenario, if blind-ending testicular vessels are seen on the right side during laparoscopy, it indicates that the testis is absent or atrophic (non-functional). Inguinal exploration would not be beneficial in such cases since there is no testis to bring down. Option B - Abdominal exploration: Abdominal exploration refers to further surgical exploration within the abdomen to locate the undescended testis. However, if blind-ending testicular vessels are visualized during laparoscopy, it suggests the absence or atrophy of the testis. Additional abdominal exploration would not change this finding and would not be necessary. Option C - Scrotal exploration : Scrotal exploration involves surgical exploration of the scrotum to locate the undescended testis. However, if blind-ending testicular vessels are observed during laparoscopy, it suggests the absence or atrophy of the testis. Scrotal exploration would not yield a different outcome since the testis is not present or non-functional. Reference: Prepladder Notes",

The chronic inflammation causes fibrosis and contraction of the bladder, resulting in its characteristic appearance. Incorrect Options: Options A - Acute TB : Acute TB refers to an active and progressive infection caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis. While TB can affect various organs, including the lungs, lymph nodes, and kidneys, it is less commonly associated with acute bladder involvement. Therefore, acute TB is not typically associated with a thimble bladder. Options C - Neurogenic bladder: Neurogenic bladder is defined as bladder dysfunction resulting from a central or peripheral neurologic insult. Possible symptoms include urinary incontinence, urgency, nocturia, straining, incomplete voiding, and urinary retention. Options D - Schistosomiasis: Schistosomiasis is a parasitic infection caused by Schistosoma species.

      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "evidence of hydronephrosis is PCNL Percutaneous Nephrolithotomy (PCNL) is a minimally invasive surgical procedure used to remove large kidney stones. It involves making a small incision in the back and creating a tract into the kidney to access and remove the stone. PCNL is particularly effective for larger stones, typically those larger than 2 cm. In the case of a 3 cm stone in the renal pelvis, PCNL is the preferred treatment option because it allows for direct access to the stone and provides effective clearance. The procedure involves using specialized instruments, such as a nephroscope and laser or ultrasound energy, to break up the stone into smaller fragments and remove them. The surgeon can visualize the stone and surrounding structures to ensure complete stone clearance. Incorrect Options: Option A - ESWL: ESWL Extracorporeal Shock Wave Lithotripsy uses shock waves to break up kidney stones from outside the body. However, it is generally more suitable for smaller stones (less than 2 cm) and may be less effective for larger stones like the 3 cm stone in the renal pelvis mentioned. Option C - Antegrade Pyeloplasty: Antegrade pyeloplasty is a surgical procedure used to treat ureteropelvic junction (UPJ) obstruction, which is a blockage at the junction between the renal pelvis and the ureter. It is not the primary treatment for kidney stones and is not specifically indicated for stone removal. Option D - Retrograde Pyeloplasty: Retrograde pyeloplasty is another surgical procedure used to treat UPJ obstruction. Similar to antegrade pyeloplasty, it is not the primary treatment for kidney stones and is not specifically indicated for stone removal. Reference: Prepladder Notes",

      "explanation": "the Sertoli cells of the testes. They are not classified as germ cell tumors but rather as interstitial tumors. Sertoli cell tumors are extremely rare and are typically benign. They are not typically observed in males as part of the germ cell tumor spectrum. Incorrect Options: Option A - Choriocarcinoma: Choriocarcinoma is a highly malignant tumor that arises from trophoblastic cells. It is a type of germ cell tumor and is observed in males, although it is more commonly associated with testicular cancer in females. Choriocarcinoma is one of the subtypes of germ cell tumors. Option B - Seminoma: Seminoma is the most common type of germ cell tumor in males, accounting for approximately 40-50% of cases. It arises from the germinal epithelium of the seminiferous tubules. Seminomas are typically observed in males and are a classic example of a germ cell tumor. Option D - Teratoma: Teratoma is another type of germ cell tumor that can occur in the testes. It is characterized by the presence of tissues derived from all three germ cell layers: ectoderm, endoderm, and mesoderm. Teratomas can occur in both males and females and are commonly found in the testes as well as other locations such as the ovaries and sacrococcygeal region. They are part of the spectrum of germ cell tumors typically observed in males. Reference: Prepladder Notes",

This anatomical abnormality predisposes the individual to testicular torsion, which is the twisting of the testicle and its associated structures. Testicular torsion can lead to ischemia (lack of blood flow) and if not promptly treated, it can result in testicular damage or loss. Incorrect Options: Option B - Varicocele: Varicocele is a condition characterized by the enlargement of veins within the scrotum. It is not directly related to the Bell clapper deformity. Varicocele is more commonly associated with the impairment of venous drainage in the testicles. Option C - Cancer of testis: The Bell clapper deformity itself does not predispose to testicular cancer. Testicular cancer typically arises from abnormal growth of cells within the testicles and is influenced by various factors such as genetic predisposition, previous testicular abnormalities, and environmental factors. Option D - Hydrocele: Hydrocele is a condition characterized by the accumulation of fluid around the testicle, leading to scrotal swelling. It is not directly related to the Bell clapper deformity. Hydrocele can occur due to various reasons, including trauma, infection, or underlying testicular abnormalities. Reference: Prepladder Notes",

      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "presents with a staghorn calculus of over 4 cm in size. PCNL and ESWL (Sandwich technique) is used in the preferred management for such large stones. Indications for PCNL : Stone size larger than 2 cm: The staghorn calculus clearly exceeds this size threshold. Presence of distal obstruction: Staghorn calculi can cause obstruction in the urinary tract. Urinary Tract Infection (UTI): Staghorn calculi are often associated with UTIs. Stone hardness, especially hard stones like BHC-2: Staghorn calculi tend to be hard. Stones located in the lower calyx: PCNL is particularly effective for stones in this location. Combined Approach for Staghorn Calculi : For staghorn calculi, a combined approach of PCNL and ESWL (Sandwich technique) is used. This combines the advantages of both methods for better stone fragmentation and clearance. Incorrect Options: Option A - ESWL: While (Extracorporeal Shock Wave Lithotripsy) ESWL is effective for smaller stones, it's less suitable for large staghorn calculi like the one presented here (>4 cm). Staghorn calculi often require multiple sessions of ESWL, which may not be as effective as PCNL for complete clearance. Option C - Ureteroscopic Removal: Ureteroscopic removal is not ideal for staghorn calculi due to their large size and complex shape. Ureteroscopy is more suitable for smaller stones located in the ureter or smaller renal calculi. Option D - Retro Renal Surgery: Retro renal surgery is not a standard treatment for renal calculi, especially with the availability of less invasive techniques like PCNL. It may be considered in rare and complex cases where other methods are not feasible, but it's not the primary choice for staghorn calculi. Reference: Prepladder Notes",

        "D": "Delayed exploration on symptomatic side only"
      },
      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "torsion is a surgical emergency that requires prompt intervention. Exploring both the symptomatic and asymptomatic side is recommended because torsion can occur bilaterally or can progress to involve the contralateral testicle. Exploratory surgery allows for immediate assessment of the torsion, detorsion of the affected testicle, and fixation of both testicles to prevent future torsion episodes. Incorrect Options: Option B - Immediate exploration on the symptomatic side only : While immediate exploration of the symptomatic side is essential, it does not address the potential involvement of the contralateral testicle. Failing to explore the asymptomatic side may lead to delayed identification and management of a potential torsion on that side, which can result in testicular loss. Option C - Delayed exploration on both symptomatic and asymptomatic side : Delaying exploration increases the risk of irreversible testicular damage due to compromised blood flow. Testicular torsion is a time-sensitive condition, and any delay in surgical intervention can lead to testicular necrosis and loss. Option D - Delayed exploration on the symptomatic side only: Delaying exploration on the symptomatic side only can result in testicular ischemia and loss. As mentioned earlier, testicular torsion requires immediate surgical intervention to prevent further damage and preserve testicular viability. Reference: Prepladder Notes",

      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "different types of minerals. Each type of stone has its own characteristics and may respond differently to treatment methods such as Extracorporeal Shock-Wave Lithotripsy (ESWL). Cystine stones are formed due to a genetic disorder called cystinuria, which affects the reabsorption of cystine in the kidneys. These stones are composed of cystine, an amino acid. Cystine stones are typically resistant to ESWL due to their hard and dense nature. Incorrect Options: Option A - Struvite: Struvite stones, also called infection stones, are composed of magnesium ammonium phosphate. These stones can grow rapidly and are often associated with urinary tract infections. Struvite stones are generally amenable to ESWL treatment. Option C - Calcium oxalate dihydrate: Calcium oxalate stones are the most common type of kidney stones. They can occur in different forms, including calcium oxalate dihydrate. These stones can vary in their response to ESWL, with some calcium oxalate stones being successfully fragmented with shock waves. However, the effectiveness of ESWL may depend on the size, location, and composition of the stone. Option D - Uric Acid : Uric acid stones form due to high levels of uric acid in the urine. They can be dissolved or fragmented using ESWL. Uric acid stones are generally responsive to ESWL treatment. Reference: Prepladder Notes",

      "explanation": "management of testicular tumors suspected to be malignant. It involves the surgical removal of the affected testicle through a high inguinal incision. The excised testicle is sent for histopathological examination to confirm the diagnosis and determine the exact type of testicular cancer. Incorrect Options: Option B - Core needle tract biopsy: Core needle tract biopsy is not the preferred option in this scenario. Testicular tumors are usually managed by surgical excision (orchidectomy) rather than biopsy due to the risk of tumor dissemination along the needle tract. Option C - FNAC: FNAC (Fine-needle aspiration cytology) is not the preferred option for testicular tumors. It is less commonly used for testicular masses as it may not provide sufficient tissue for accurate histopathological examination and diagnosis. Option D - Whole-body PET/CT: While whole-body PET/CT can be useful in staging and detecting metastasis in testicular cancer, it is not the initial step in management. Orchidectomy is performed first for histopathological diagnosis, and subsequent staging and imaging studies may be performed to assess the extent of the disease. Reference: Prepladder Notes",
