      "question": "A 60 y/o male suddenly experiences an intense headache, described as the worst headache of his life, followed by vomiting and photophobia. O/E he has neck stiffness and a dilated pupil on the right side. A CT scan reveals bleeding in the subarachnoid space. Which of the following is the most common cause of this condition?",
      "options": {
        "A": "Hypertension",
        "B": "Intracranial aneurysm",
        "C": "Arteriovenous malformation (AVM)",
        "D": "Brain tumour"
      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: B) Intracranial aneurysm Explanation: The clinical scenario described is highly indicative of a subarachnoid haemorrhage (SAH), which is characterized by the sudden onset of a severe headache, vomiting, photophobia, neck stiffness, and neurological signs such as a dilated pupil. The most common cause of subarachnoid haemorrhage (SAH) is the rupture of an intracranial aneurysm , responsible for about 50% of cases. Subarachnoid Haemorrhage (SAH) Intracranial haemorrhage into the subarachnoid space, typically originating from the basal cisterns. It may occur spontaneously or following trauma (Trauma > Spontaneous) Causes of spontaneous SAH: Intracranial aneurysms: The most common cause Hypertension: Contributing to the formation and rupture of aneurysms. Arteriovenous (A-V) malformations Blood dyscrasias Anticoagulant drugs: Increasing the risk of bleeding. Brain tumours (malignant): Causing vessel erosion or rupture. Clinical Features: Sudden onset: Severe headache with vomiting. Raised intracranial pressure : Signs like photophobia and neck stiffness. Focal neurological deficits: Hemiplegia, dysphasia. Eye changes: Ptosis, dilated pupil, abnormal eye movements. Sudden loss of consciousness Rebleeding risk: Occurs in 40% of patients within 6-8 weeks, often fatal. Investigations: Imaging: CT scan: Primary imaging modality. Angiography: Carotid and vertebral angiogram to identify aneurysms or vascular malformations. Lumbar puncture: Performed to differentiate from meningitis ; done cautiously due to risk of coning. Management: Surgical interventions: Clipping or wrapping of aneurysm. Craniotomy: Followed by necessary procedures. Ligation of the common carotid artery: Risk of hemiplegia. Therapeutic embolization : To block abnormal blood vessels. Excision of vascular malformations. Reference: SRB’s Manual of surgery, 6th edition, Pages 1083,1084 Bailey and Love Short manual of surgery, 28th Edition, Pages 708-711",

      "question": "Which specific nerve is affected in Frey's syndrome?",
      "options": {
        "A": "Facial Nerve",
        "B": "Oculomotor nerve",
        "C": "Auriculotemporal nerve",
        "D": "Glossopharyngeal nerve"
      },
      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "the auriculotemporal nerve, which is a branch of the trigeminal nerve (cranial nerve V). This nerve is responsible for providing sensory innervation to the skin of the temple, external ear, and the parotid gland. When there is damage to this nerve, it can lead to aberrant reinnervation of sweat glands in the affected area, resulting in gustatory sweating during eating or other gustatory stimuli. Incorrect Options: Option B Oculomotor nerve: The oculomotor nerve (cranial nerve III) is responsible for the motor control of several eye muscles, including those that control eye movements, pupil constriction, and eyelid elevation. It is not involved in Frey's syndrome. Option D Glossopharyngeal nerve: The glossopharyngeal nerve (cranial nerve IX) is responsible for various functions related to the throat, including the sensation and taste from the posterior third of the tongue, the motor control of some throat muscles, and the regulation of blood pressure. While it does play a role in taste sensation, it is not directly involved in Frey's syndrome. Option A Facial Nerve: The facial nerve (cranial nerve VII) is a mixed nerve responsible for controlling the muscles of facial expression, transmitting taste sensations from the anterior two-thirds of the tongue, and providing parasympathetic innervation to the lacrimal and salivary glands. In the case of Frey's syndrome, the facial nerve is not directly involved in the syndrome itself. However, it is associated with the condition due to the proximity and interconnections between the facial nerve and the auriculotemporal nerve.",

      "question": "Which of the following tests would a surgeon advise first in a patient with a large thyroid swelling?",
      "options": {
        "A": "Ultrasound of the neck",
        "B": "FNAC",
        "C": "Biopsy",
        "D": "Radioiodine uptake"
      },
      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: A) Ultrasound of the neck Explanation: When a patient presents with a large thyroid swelling, the first step in evaluating the swelling is typically to perform an ultrasound of the neck . USG provides high resolution of the thyroid gland by well-characterizing parenchymal and nodular abnormalities. It provides valuable information about the size, characteristics, and composition of the swelling, and it also helps differentiate cystic and solid thyroid nodules. Ultrasound can guide further management, such as whether fine-needle aspiration cytology (FNAC) is necessary. FNAC (Option B) is a minimally invasive diagnostic procedure to evaluate abnormalities in various tissues, including thyroid nodules, but it is usually performed after imaging to assess the cytological details of the swelling. Biopsy (Option C) is generally not the first step in managing thyroid swelling. FNAC is typically preferred over a surgical biopsy for diagnostic purposes. A biopsy would be considered only if malignancy is strongly suspected and other tests (like FNAC) are inconclusive. Radioiodine uptake (Option D) is used to assess the functional status of the thyroid, but it is not the first step in evaluating a swelling. It is primarily used in cases where there are concerns about thyrotoxicosis or hyperthyroidism or in the context of thyroid nodules with known thyroid dysfunction.

        "D": "Internal operative fixation of the fracture’s segments"
      },
      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: C) IPPV Explanation: The given condition, along with the X-ray showing multiple rib fractures, is suggestive of a Flail chest, and the most appropriate intervention in this case is IPPV . Positive pressure ventilation is the appropriate initial management in such cases, as it helps to stabilise the flail segment by providing consistent internal pressure, reducing paradoxical movement, and improving oxygenation. Flail chest Definition It occurs when three or more consecutive ribs are fractured in at least two places , creating a flail segment that moves independently. It exhibits paradoxical chest movement (inwards during inhalation & outwards during exhalation) Clinical features Hypoventilation: Reduced lung ventilation leads to low oxygen and high CO I levels. Mediastinal Flutter: Abnormal mediastinal movement risks sudden cardiac arrest. Pendular Air Movement: Inefficient air exchange between lungs. Complications Hemothorax: Blood in the chest cavity. Pneumothorax: Air in the chest cavity. Management Ventilation Support: Oxygen supplementation and Analgesics- Initial management IPPV is the preferred TOC. Tracheostomy if support exceeds 10 days. Injury Management: Intercostal Tube Drainage : Removes air/fluids from the pleural space. Rib Fixation : Stabilises the chest wall. Supportive Care: Blood Transfusions : For blood loss. IV Fluids : For hydration. Antibiotics : To prevent infection. Medications : Bronchodilators and steroids. Thoracotomy: Considered in severe cases Chest tube drainage (Option C) is used for pneumothorax or hemothorax, which may accompany the flail chest. However, without these complications, immediate airway management and stabilisation are more crucial, given the severity of the respiratory distress. 24% oxygen (Option B) is not sufficient for a patient in respiratory distress with a SpO2 of",

        "D": "Most of the retrosternal goitres can be removed by a neck incision"
      },
      "correct_answer": "D",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer D - Most of the retrosternal goitres can be removed by a neck incision: Surgical approach decisions for retrosternal goitre depend on the size , location , and associated symptoms , and while some may require a sternotomy, most can be removed through a neck incision alone. Retrosternal goitre Definition A thyroid gland enlargement that extends into the mediastinum behind the Sternum Types Primary: Ectopic thyroid tissue in the mediastinum (10%) Secondary: Starts from neck and extends retrosternally (90%) Clinical Features Neck Swelling with Compression Symptoms: Difficulty breathing (tracheal compression) and swallowing (esophageal compression). Pemberton Sign: Facial flushing and increased difficulty breathing when raising the arms due to thoracic inlet compression. Diagnosis Physical examination: Limited palpation of the lower border of the thyroid swelling. Imaging: Computed Tomography (CT) Scan of the Neck and Chest is IOC to assess the extent of mediastinal involvement and to evaluate compression of surrounding structures. Management Primary / Recurrent / Large Malignant Retrosternal Goiter - Median Sternotomy (Option B ruled out) Secondary Retrosternal Goiter - Cervical / Neck Incision Operated in all patients regardless of symptoms (Option A): Surgical resection is the preferred standard for managing symptomatic retrosternal goitres and some asymptomatic cases. However, a \"watchful waiting\" approach may be appropriate for selected asymptomatic patients, especially with the development of alternative treatments. It receives blood supply from the thoracodorsal artery (Option C): blood supply to a retrosternal goitre primarily comes from the thyroid arteries, and the thoracodorsal artery mainly supplies the latissimus dorsi muscle, not the thyroid or retrosternal goitre.

      "explanation": "Correct Answer D - Half fall in 10 min The Miami criteria are used in intraoperative parathyroid hormone (PTH) monitoring during parathyroidectomy. It states that a \"half fall in PTH within 10 minutes after the removal of the suspected parathyroid adenoma indicates that the surgery has been successful\" in curing the patient’s hyperparathyroidism. If PTH levels do not decrease after parathyroid surgery, it indicates that the cause of hyperparathyroidism may not have been fully addressed. Further investigation, reoperation, or imaging may be required to identify additional hyperfunctioning glands or exclude other potential causes.

        "C": "Parotid duct",
        "D": "Mandibular branch of facial nerve"
      },
      "correct_answer": "D",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: D) Mandibular branch of facial nerve Explanation : Weakness of the left lower lip after parotid surgery suggests injury to the mandibular branch of the facial nerve. The facial nerve is responsible for motor innervation to the muscles of facial expression. It is more commonly at risk during parotid gland surgeries Complications of Parotidectomy: Complication Description Temporary Facial Palsy Mostly the lower branches of the facial nerve - the marginal mandibular nerve. Most patients recover over time. Infection Rare, as parotidectomy is a clean procedure. Aseptic precautions and timely drain removal reduce the risk. Hematoma Formation Uncommon. Careful intraoperative hemostasis can prevent it. Larger hematomas may indicate a bleeding disorder and require management. Sialocele Formation Occurs if the main ductal system is exposed. Preventable with subcapsular dissection. Treatment: Anticholinergics, aspiration, and pressure dressings. Retromandibular area hollowing Can occur post-surgery Reduced by placing autologous fat grafts during the surgery. Frey’s Syndrome Also known as gustatory sweating; Caused by the cross-innervation of sweat glands by regenerating nerve fibres of the auriculotemporal nerve. For mild cases : Give antiperspirants; Severe cases: Botulinum toxin injections or tympanic neurectomy. Permanent Facial Nerve Weakness D/t transection of the facial nerve during the surgery. Facial Numbness Permanent numbness of the earlobe, D/t transection of the great auricular nerve during the surgery. Temporal branch of the facial nerve (Option A) controls the upper face (e.g., forehead and eyelid), so injury here would not affect the lower lip . Cervical branch of the facial nerve (Option B) innervates the platysma muscle, which primarily affects neck and lower face movement but would also cause some degree of neck weakness and not just isolated lower lip weakness . Parotid duct (Option C) damage can affect the saliva flow but does not result in weakness of the lower lip . Reference: Bailey and Love’s Short Practice of Surgery, 28th edition, pages 848, 849",

      },
      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "Correct answer A) Type 3 branchial fistula has its internal orifice on cricopharynxgeus: Explanation: A branchial fistula can appear on one side or both sides and likely indicates a persistent second branchial cleft. The opening is typically found in the lower part of the neck near the front edge of the sternocleidomastoid muscle externally and internally; it's situated behind the tonsil on the front aspect of the posterior faucial pillar. In Type III cases, the passage runs between the internal and external carotid arteries, possibly reaching the pharynx's lateral wall or the base of the skull. Cystic hygroma is filled with clear lymph (Option B): Cystic hygroma lymphangioma is a birth defect with a large fluid-filled sac around the head and neck. The cyst comprises lymphatic tissues and white blood cells. Thyroglossal cyst moves upwards on swallowing and tongue protrusion (Option C): Thyroglossal duct cysts move upwards on swallowing and notably with tongue protrusion but this may occur with other midline cysts. Fluctuation is positive in branchial cyst (Option D): Branchial cyst is a fluctuant swelling that may transilluminate and is usually soft at its early stages, which makes it difficult to palpate.

      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: A) Local excision and biopsy Explanation: The patient's whitish lesion on the gingivobuccal sulcus for 7 months, combined with a history of tobacco chewing, suggests Oral Submucous Fibrosis (OSMF) , and local excision with biopsy is crucial to confirm the diagnosis and rule out malignancy or dysplasia. It is a progressive condition involving deep fibrosis in the oral mucosa, characterized by fibrous bands and considered a precancerous lesion. Cause Hypersensitivity to tobacco, betel nut, chilli , areca nut, vitamin deficiencies, localised collagen disorders. Leads to alteration of collagen metabolism causing juxtaepithelial progressive inflammatory fibrosis of the submucosa. This leads to atrophy and dysplasia. Clinical features Common in Asians Males and females are equally affected. Soreness in the mouth more during meals Burning, also more while eating Vesicular eruptions Trismus Difficulty in protruding tongue Fibrosis and scarring Ankylosing glossitis Management Cessation of causative factors(tobacco, chilli, areca nut) Oral hygiene Dexamethasone local injections Hydrocortisone HCG submucosal injection Vitamin and iron supplementation Surgical excision with graft Stem cell therapy Avoid smoking + Wait and watch (Option B) overlooks the lesion's severity and potential malignancy risk. Waiting without biopsy could delay diagnosis and treatment, worsening the condition. Steroidal Injection (Option C) helps manage inflammation in OSMF but is not the initial step. A biopsy is needed first to confirm the diagnosis and rule out malignancy before considering steroid treatment. Sclerotherapy (Option D) is used for vascular conditions, not OSMF. It is not the recommended initial treatment",

        "D": "Dermoid cyst"
      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: B) Thyroglossal cyst Explanation: A thyroglossal cyst is a midline neck swelling that typically moves with swallowing or protrusion of the tongue. It results from incomplete closure of the thyroglossal duct, which is an embryological remnant. The cyst often lies in close proximity to the hyoid bone and can be felt to shift with movement of the tongue or swallowing. Thyroglossal Cyst: It is a congenital neck mass resulting from the persistence of the thyroglossal duct, an embryological structure. It can also be present in adulthood. The cyst represents a remnant of this duct and can be found anywhere along the midline from the base of the tongue to the thyroid isthmus. It presents as midline swelling that moves with deglutition and protrusion of the tongue. Most Common Site: Subhyoid (can also be seen on the floor of the mouth, Suprahyoid, near thyroid cartilage and foramen caecum) Treatment: Sistrunk Procedure: Complete surgical excision of the cyst and its tract up to the base of the tongue and a portion of the hyoid bone to prevent recurrence. Incision and drainage are never done as they lead to the formation of a Thyroglossal fistula. (It also forms if an inflamed cyst ruptures.)—Always Acquired. Brachial cyst (Option A): A brachial cyst, or branchial cleft cyst, generally appears as a lump along the anterior border of the sternocleidomastoid muscle, not in the midline of the neck. Plunging ranula (Option C) is a mucous cyst found in the floor of the mouth, typically located laterally rather than in the midline, and it usually doesn't shift with swallowing or tongue protrusion. Dermoid cyst (Option D) , a type of teratoma, is often present at birth and can appear in the midline of the neck. However, these cysts typically do not move with swallowing or tongue protrusion.",

        "D": "Branchial cyst"
      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: B) Ranula Explanation: The most likely diagnosis is Ranula, a specific type of mucus retention cyst that develops on the floor of the mouth, typically caused by blockage or rupture of the ducts of the sublingual or submandibular glands. This leads to mucus accumulation and the formation of a cystic swelling. Ranula Definition Ranulas are a type of extravasation mucocele caused by the rupture of the main duct or obstructed acini of the sublingual gland. They appear as bluish swellings on the floor of the mouth and resemble the belly of a frog. Location Commonly found in the anterior floor of the mouth. When it extends through the mylohyoid muscle, it presents as a submental swelling known as a \"plunging ranula.\" Symptoms Typically soft, fluctuant, and painless unless infected. Diagnosis Confirmed through Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) Ultrasound Aspiration of thick, sticky saliva differentiates it from a lymphangioma. Treatment Removal of the sublingual gland is preferred. Incision, drainage, and marsupialisation have low success rates. Although marsupialisation is often adequate, it has a higher recurrence rate compared to sublingual gland excision. OK-432 injection Botulinum toxin injections Incorrect Options: Cystic hygroma (Option A) is a congenital abnormality of the lymphatic system, usually presenting as a soft, cystic swelling in the neck area. It is not typically found on the floor of the mouth. Dermoid (Option C) cysts are developmental cysts that contain various tissues, such as skin, hair follicles, and sebaceous glands. While they can occur on the floor of the mouth, they are not exclusive to this region. Branchial cysts (Option D) are congenital cysts that form from remnants of the branchial apparatus. They are primarily found in the neck area and are not commonly seen on the floor of the mouth.",

      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "cells of the thyroid gland, not from parafollicular C-cells. Parafollicular C-cells, also known as parathyroid cells or clear cells, are responsible for producing calcitonin, a hormone that regulates calcium levels in the body. Medullary thyroid cancer, a different type of thyroid cancer, arises from parafollicular C-cells. Incorrect Options: Option A - It often presents with cervical lymph node metastases: Papillary thyroid cancer commonly spreads to nearby lymph nodes in the neck. This is a characteristic feature of this type of thyroid cancer. Option B - It is the most common type of thyroid cancer: Papillary thyroid cancer is indeed the most common type of thyroid cancer, accounting for approximately 70-80% of all cases. Option D - It is TSH dependent: Papillary thyroid cancer is generally considered to be TSH (thyroid-stimulating hormone) dependent. TSH, which is produced by the pituitary gland, stimulates the thyroid gland to produce thyroid hormones. Elevated TSH levels can contribute to the growth and function of papillary thyroid cancer cells. This is why TSH suppression therapy (using medications to lower TSH levels) is often part of the treatment plan for papillary thyroid cancer. Reference: .",

      "correct_answer": "D",
      "explanation": "of Thyroglossal duct cyst. Sistrunk's operation is a surgical procedure used to treat a thyroglossal duct cyst. Thyroglossal duct cyst is a developmental anomaly resulting from the persistence of the thyroglossal duct. This cyst can present as a swelling in the subhyoid region of the neck that moves with swallowing and tongue protrusion. Sistrunk's operation involves removing the cyst, along with a portion of the hyoid bone and the central portion of the body of the hyoid bone. This procedure helps prevent recurrence and ensures complete removal of the cyst. Incorrect Options: Option A - Total thyroidectomy: This option is not appropriate for the given scenario. Total thyroidectomy involves the complete removal of the thyroid gland, which is not indicated for a swelling in the subhyoid region of the neck that moves with swallowing and tongue protrusion. Additionally, total thyroidectomy is not a suitable approach for a pediatric patient without proper indications. Option B - Ramstedt's operation: Ramstedt's operation, also known as pyloromyotomy, is a surgical procedure performed to treat pyloric stenosis, which is a condition affecting the stomach's outlet. This option is not relevant to the given scenario of a swelling in the subhyoid region of the neck. Option C - Hemi-thyroidectomy: Hemi-thyroidectomy involves the removal of half of the thyroid gland. This option is also not appropriate for the situation described. The subhyoid swelling is not related to the thyroid gland and its removal would not address the issue. Reference: PREPLADDER notes",

      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "trachea through the neck. While it provides a secure airway, it's generally not the initial choice for managing airways in maxillofacial trauma patients unless there are specific indications, such as severe facial fractures that prevent other methods of intubation. Tracheostomy is considered a more invasive procedure and is usually reserved for situations where other methods are not feasible or have failed. Incorrect Options : Option B - Laryngeal Mask Airway (LMA): Laryngeal mask airway is a supraglottic airway device that is less invasive than tracheostomy. It sits in the pharynx and seals around the laryngeal inlet, allowing positive pressure ventilation. However, in cases of significant maxillofacial trauma, proper placement and effective ventilation might be compromised due to anatomical disruptions and bleeding. Option C - Orotracheal Intubation: Orotracheal intubation involves passing an endotracheal tube through the mouth into the trachea. It provides a secure airway and is often the preferred choice for managing maxillofacial trauma patients, as it bypasses the potential obstacles created by facial fractures, allowing effective ventilation and protection of the airway. Option D - Mask Ventilation: Mask ventilation involves using a bag-mask device to manually deliver positive pressure ventilation to a patient. While it might be used temporarily in situations where intubation is difficult, it's not the intubation method itself. In maxillofacial trauma, mask ventilation can be challenging due to disrupted facial anatomy and potential difficulty in achieving a proper seal.",

      "explanation": "adjuvant radiotherapy because it signifies a higher risk of local recurrence and poorer prognosis. ENE occurs when cancer extends beyond the lymph node capsule into surrounding tissues.It is major criterion for RT Incorrect Options: Option B - Multiple lymph node metastasis: Multiple lymph node metastases (particularly when there are three or more positive nodes) significantly increase the risk of recurrence, making adjuvant radiotherapy necessary to improve local control and overall survival. But ENE has the highest risk and priority for adjuvant RT Option C - T3 tumor: A T3 tumor, which indicates a large primary tumor or one that invades adjacent structures, is a high-risk factor. While it may warrant adjuvant radiotherapy, it is not as definitive an indication as ENE. Option D - Close margin : A close margin, typically defined as less than 5 mm between the tumor and the resection edge, often leads to consideration for adjuvant therapy. However, it is not as strong an indication as multiple lymph node metastases or ENE, and decisions are often made case-by-case depending on other factors.

      "explanation": "small margin of surrounding normal tissue. This technique is appropriate for larger or more advanced lesions where complete excision may be difficult or if the diagnosis needs confirmation before planning further treatment. It helps in diagnosing the cancer and planning the subsequent management. Incorrect Options: Option C - Superficial Biopsy from the Border with Normal Tissue: In SCC of the lip, obtaining a biopsy from the border of the lesion, where the tumor is likely to be more active and adjacent to normal tissue, is preferred. Biopsy from the central necrotic area may not provide representative tissue for accurate diagnosis and staging. This approach ensures that the sample is more likely to contain viable cancer cells, aiding in precise diagnosis and effective treatment planning. Option B - Excisional Biopsy: This involves removing the entire tumor along with some surrounding normal tissue. This technique is often used for small, localized tumors and is typically preferred when a definitive diagnosis can be made, and the entire tumor can be removed in one procedure. For SCC of the lip, if the lesion is small and localized, an excisional biopsy can also serve as a treatment. Option D - Contraindicated: The biopsy method for SCC of the lip is not contraindicated.

        "D": "Bag mask with jaw thrust"
      },
      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: C) Cricothyroidotomy Explanation: Cricothyroidotomy is the most appropriate immediate management when oro- or nasotracheal intubation is not feasible due to severe maxillofacial trauma. It provides an emergency surgical airway when other methods fail. Emergency Assessment and Management of Maxillofacial Trauma: Initial Assessment: Airway, Breathing, Circulation (ABC): Prioritize airway management following ATLS guidelines. Remove visible airway obstructions and apply direct pressure to bleeding points. Midface Bleeding: In conscious patients, position them forward or in the recovery position to prevent blood from obstructing the airway. Caution with suspected spinal injury. Maxillofacial Skeleton Damage: In cases of maxilla detachment or bilateral mandibular fractures, airway compromise is common due to tongue displacement and soft tissue edema. Airway Management: Endotracheal Intubation: Prepare for intubation, needle cricothyroidotomy, or surgical airway if intubation is difficult. Relieving Airway Compromise: Disimpact the maxilla and pull the tongue forward using a suture or towel clip. Ensure high-volume suction to clear blood and debris. Hemorrhage Management: Severe Bleeding: Control hemorrhage from large lacerations or penetrating injuries with direct pressure, nasal packs, or Foley catheters. Airway Protection: If swelling threatens the airway, consider endotracheal intubation or surgical airway. Head and Orbital Injury Assessment: Head Injury: A CT scan should be performed to rule out intracranial injuries, especially in intoxicated patients. Orbital Damage: Orbital fractures may lead to vision loss if untreated. Retrobulbar hemorrhage can cause optic nerve compression, leading to blindness. Incorrect Options: Tracheostomy (Option A) is typically used for longer-term airway management, not as an immediate intervention in acute trauma situations. Bag-mask ventilation with jaw thrust (Option D) is not suitable for this patient due to the extensive facial trauma, which compromises the airway and makes this method ineffective. Endotracheal intubation (Option B) would be attempted first, but in cases where maxillofacial trauma precludes this, other options like cricothyroidotomy are prioritized.

If the oesophagus is compressed, it can cause difficulty swallowing (dysphagia) due to obstruction, making it hard for food or liquid to pass down the throat. The sympathetic chain, if compressed, can lead to Horner syndrome, which presents as ptosis (drooping eyelid), miosis (constricted pupil), anhidrosis (lack of sweating), and enophthalmosis (sunken eyeball) on the affected side. Compression of the recurrent laryngeal nerve can cause hoarseness (changes in the voice or voice weakness) because this nerve controls the muscles of the vocal cords, and its dysfunction affects vocalisation.

      "explanation": "to the obstruction of the salivary gland duct. Conservative management approaches like incision and drainage or aspiration may provide temporary relief but have a higher chance of recurrence. Excision, which involves complete removal of the cyst and associated gland, is the most effective approach to prevent recurrence. Incorrect Options: Option A - Incision and drainage : Incision and drainage may be used for an acute or infected Ranula but are not the preferred management for recurrent cases as they have a higher risk of recurrence. Option B - Aspiration : Aspiration involves removing the fluid from the cyst using a needle and syringe. While it can provide temporary relief, it is not the ideal management for recurrent Ranula. Option D - Sclerosant injection : Sclerosant injection involves injecting a sclerosing agent into the cyst to induce scarring and subsequent closure. While this may be used in certain cases, it is not the primary procedure for recurrent Ranula. Reference: Prepladder Notes",
