      "explanation": "Correct Answer: B) Hepatocellular carcinoma Explanation: Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the most common type of primary liver tumor. It arises from hepatocytes and is frequently associated with chronic liver diseases such as hepatitis B and C, as well as cirrhosis. Option A : Metastatic tumors are the most common type of liver tumor overall. The liver is a common site for metastasis from cancers such as colorectal, breast, and lung cancer. Option C : Hepatoblastoma is the most common pediatric liver cancer but is much less common than HCC in adults. Option D : Hemangioma is the most common benign liver tumor and is usually asymptomatic, often discovered incidentally during imaging for other reasons.

      },
      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: C) Lungs Explanation: Primary liver tumors, such as hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), typically metastasize to specific sites in a common order: Lungs : The lungs are the most common site for metastasis from HCC. Pulmonary metastases often occur due to the extensive blood flow from the liver to the lungs. Lymph nodes : Regional lymph nodes are also frequently involved in metastasis from liver tumors. Bones : Metastasis to bones can occur and may present with symptoms such as bone pain or fractures. Brain : While less common, brain metastases can occur in advanced stages of liver cancer. Kidneys : Metastasis to the kidneys is not typical for primary liver tumors. Reference: Bailey & Love's Short Practice of Surgery (28th Edition), Page 1216.

      "question": "A 45-year-old woman is incidentally found to have a 5 cm hepatic lesion on an ultrasound performed for evaluation of vague abdominal discomfort. A contrast-enhanced MRI shows a lesion with peripheral nodular enhancement and centripetal filling in the delayed phase. What is the most appropriate management for this patient?",
      "options": {
        "A": "Immediate surgical resection",
        "B": "Percutaneous biopsy",
        "C": "Observation with periodic imaging",
        "D": "Radiofrequency ablation"
      },
      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: C. Observation with periodic imaging Explanation: A hepatic lesion was incidentally discovered on ultrasound, commonly associated with hepatic hemangiomas. MRI reveals peripheral nodular enhancement with centripetal filling in the delayed phase, highly specific for hepatic hemangiomas. Given these imaging features and the absence of symptoms or abnormal liver function, the diagnosis of a hepatic hemangioma is strongly supported. Hepatic Hemangioma Hepatic hemangiomas are the most common benign liver tumors and are often asymptomatic. They are composed of clusters of blood vessels and are usually well-circumscribed. Most hemangiomas are small and discovered incidentally during imaging studies performed for other reasons and are more common in women. On ultrasound, hemangiomas typically appear as well-defined, hyperechoic masses. MRI is the most definitive imaging modality for diagnosing Hepatic hemangiomas. The classical appearance on MRI includes peripheral nodular enhancement during the arterial phase, followed by centripetal filling during the venous and delayed phases. MRI of a typical hemangioma in liver segment VIII. T2-weighted imaging showed a bright hyperintense lesion (‘light bulb phenomenon’). After injection of contrast, the arterial phase (b) showed a typical rim-like peripheral enhancement with gradual centripetal contrast uptake in the portal-venous phase (c) and in the late phase (d) Kasabach-Merritt syndrome , characterized by thrombocytopenia and consumptive coagulopathy, is a rare condition associated with hepatic hemangioma. Management For small, asymptomatic hemangiomas, the standard management is observation with periodic imaging. Surgical intervention is reserved for cases where the hemangioma is symptomatic, exceeds 10 cm, shows diagnostic uncertainty after imaging, ruptures, or leads to Kasabach-Merritt syndrome. When surgery is indicated, the preferred approach is enucleation with arterial inflow control. Immediate Surgical Resection (Option A): Surgery is not recommended for asymptomatic hepatic hemangiomas with typical imaging features. Percutaneous Biopsy (Option B): Biopsy is generally avoided due to the high risk of bleeding from the vascular tumor. Radiofrequency Ablation (RFA) (Option D): RFA is used for small malignant liver tumors, not for benign lesions like hemangiomas.",

      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: B. Focal nodular hyperplasia Explanation: Focal nodular hyperplasia (FNH) is the 2nd most common benign tumor of the liver. It is typically asymptomatic and often discovered incidentally during imaging for other reasons. It is more common in females and is associated with oral contraceptive pill use. Diagnosis: The investigation of choice for FNH is contrast-enhanced CT (CECT), which typically shows a characteristic central stellate scar due to the presence of a central feeding arteriole with multiple peripheral branches. Angiography may show a spoke-wheel or cartwheel pattern due to abnormal vascularity. Management: Most cases of FNH do not require treatment and are managed with observation. Surgical excision is considered if there is diagnostic uncertainty or if the lesion is symptomatic. A : arterial phase B : portal phase C : magnetic resonance imaging(MRI) D : pathological examination of the resected specimen. Hepatocellular carcinoma (Option A) presents with symptoms such as abdominal pain, weight loss, and jaundice, and has different imaging characteristics such as arterial hypervascularization with venous washout. Hepatic adenoma (Option C) may present with abdominal pain and is associated with a higher risk of malignant transformation. Imaging may show peripheral hypervascularization. Hemangioma (Option D) is usually asymptomatic, diagnosed incidentally with imaging showing peripheral nodular enhancement on MRI. It does not present with a central stellate scar.",

        "D": "Focal nodular hyperplasia"
      },
      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: C Hepatic adenoma Explanation: Hepatic adenoma is a benign proliferative disorder of hepatocytes. They are more common in females on OCPs . They are characterized by poorly supported peripherally located blood vessels. This can lead to: An increased risk of hemorrhage and necrosis Abdominal pain A high risk of tumor rupture (30-50%). In contrast, the risk of rupture in hepatocellular carcinoma is only 3-5%. An increased risk of tumour rupture during pregnancy Clinical Features: Most patients with hepatic adenoma are symptomatic. The most common symptom is abdominal pain . Tumor rupture can lead to hemoperitoneum and shock. Diagnosis: The investigation of choice is a CECT scan, which shows peripheral hypervascularization. Treatment: For hemangiomas larger than 5 cm, the risk of rupture and malignancy typically warrants surgical excision. Discontinuing oral contraceptive pills may lead to regression of the lesion. Differential diagnosis: Hepatocellular carcinoma (Option A) is less likely in a young patient without u nderlying liver disease. While hepatic hemangioma (Option B )is also associated with oral contraceptive use, it is usually asymptomatic. Focal nodular hyperplasia (Option D) is less likely to cause symptoms like abdominal pain. Reference: Bailey & Love's Short Practice of Surgery (28th Edition), Page 1212, 1213.

      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: C) Triple phase CT Explanation: In a patient with known risk factors for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) , such as chronic hepatitis C and cirrhosis, and elevated serum alpha-fetoprotein levels, the investigation of choice is Triple phase CT. Tumor Markers: Elevated Alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) levels above 20 ng/ml are observed in approximately 70% of cases of hepatocellular carcinoma. An increase in PIVKA-II (Protein Induced by Vitamin K Absence or Antagonism-II) is also noted. Diagnosis: The initial diagnostic test for suspected Hepatocellular carcinoma is an ultrasound (USG). The preferred method for definitive diagnosis of HCC is a Triple Phase CT scan , which highlights arterial hypervascularization and venous washout. A triple-phase CT scan has the following phases: Arterial Phase - HCC shows hyperenhancement due to its arterial blood supply. Portal Venous Phase - HCC may appear isodense or hypodense as it becomes less conspicuous compared to the surrounding liver tissue. Delayed Phase - HCC exhibits washout, a characteristic feature - appearing hypodense relative to the liver parenchyma. Quadriphasic images of the enhancement features in a typical large HCC (arrows) demonstrating hypo-attenuation on non-contrast (NC)-enhanced phase, mosaic hyperenhancement on arterial phase (AP) and washout on portal venous phase (PVP) and delayed phase (DP) For screening individuals at high risk, the recommended test is an ultrasound (USG)",
