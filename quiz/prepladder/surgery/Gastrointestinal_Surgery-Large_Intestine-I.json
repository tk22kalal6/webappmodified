      "correct_answer": "D",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: D) 2 and 3 Explanation: Diverticulitis Definition Inflammation or infection of diverticula in the colon. Etiology Obstruction (fecal matter or food): Trapped fecal matter or food causes pressure and inflammation. Bacterial infection: Infection occurs when bacteria proliferate in obstructed diverticula. Pathophysiology Increased pressure from trapped fecal matter can lead to inflammation, infection, and sometimes perforation of the diverticula. Symptoms Abdominal pain (lower left side) (Statement 1 ruled out) Fever Nausea, vomiting Change in bowel habits (diarrhea or constipation) Tenderness on examination Diagnosis CT Scan (IOC): Preferred for detailed imaging of the colon, identifying inflammation and abscesses. Ultrasound: Can detect inflammation and abscesses, but less detailed than CT. Blood Tests: Elevated white blood cell count suggests infection or inflammation. Barium Enema (contraindicated) (Statement 2): Should be avoided as it can worsen symptoms. Management Antibiotics Pain management (analgesics) Dietary modifications (clear liquids, then low-fiber, high-fiber) Surgery (for severe cases or complications) Resection: Removal of the affected segment of the colon to treat severe diverticulitis or complications. Colostomy (Statement 3) : Creation of an abdominal opening for waste elimination, often used in severe cases. Drainage of Abscesses: Percutaneous or surgical methods to drain abscesses associated with diverticulitis. Modified Hinchey Classification (Severity of acute diverticulitis) Stage 0: Mild diverticulitis Stage I: Ia: Pericolic inflammation Ib: Pericolic abscess (Statement 4 ruled out) Stage II: Pelvic or intra-abdominal abscess Stage III: Purulent peritonitis Stage IV: Fecal peritonitis Complications Hemorrhage (painless and profuse) Perforation (can cause pericolic abscess) Intestinal Obstruction (large or small bowel) Fistula Formation (e.g., colovesical) (Statement 5 ruled out) Leads to frequent UTIs,",

      "explanation": "Correct Answer: B) Lynch Syndrome Explanation: The most likely diagnosis in the above clinical scenario is Lynch syndrome/Hereditary Non Polyposis Colorectal Cancer (HNPCC) Pathophysiology: Autosomal dominant condition caused by inherited mutations in DNA mismatch repair genes (MLH1, MSH2, MSH6 and PMS2) which code for mismatch repair protein (MMR) leading to microsatellite instability. In high risk cases, it often develops before the age of 50 years. Endometrial cancer, Ovarian cancer and increased risk of stomach, intestinal cancers. Diagnosis based on Amsterdam and Bethesda criteria. Amsterdam II Criteria Three or more family members with Lynch syndrome related cancer, one of whom is a 1° relative. Two or more successive affected generations. At least one tumor diagnosed before 50 years. FAP excluded Testing for microsatellite instability (MSI) and immunohistochemistry (IHC) to assess the presence of MMR proteins in tumor tissues. Endoscopic Polypectomy Extended Colectomy in case of MLH1 and MLH2 carrier. Cowden Syndrome (Option A), Although it involves endometrial cancer, it is not typically associated with a high risk of colorectal cancer alone as prominently as Lynch Syndrome. Peutz-Jeghers Syndrome (Option C) characterized by gastrointestinal polyps but not specifically associated with a combination of colorectal, endometrial, and ovarian cancers. MUTYH-Associated Polyposis (MAP) (Option D) characterized by the development of multiple colorectal polyps but does not typically involve a significant risk of endometrial or ovarian cancers.

      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: B) Cowden disease Explanation : The most likely diagnosis in the above case scenario is Cowden disease. Cowden disease / Multiple Hamartomas: Loss of PTEN function leads to activation of the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway, promoting cell proliferation and survival. Clinical manifestations such as Hamartomas , Trichilemmomas, papillomatous papules, and acral keratoses, Oral papillomas, Multinodular goiter, adenomas. Patients need to have two major criteria to be diagnosed with Cowden disease. (One of the two must be either Lhermitte-Duclos disease or macrocephaly.) Lhermitte-Duclos disease Thyroid carcinoma Macrocephaly Breast cancer Treatment: Surveillance, Removal of symptomatic hamartomas or cancers and Cutaneous lesion treated with surgical excision and 5-fluorouracil. Neurofibromatosis (Option A) is characterized by café-au-lait spots and neurofibromas. It does not typically present with oral papillomas, trichilemmomas, or a family history of breast cancer.

      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: C) Marginal Artery of Drummond Explanation: Marginal artery of Drummond is primarily responsible for providing collateral circulation in intestinal obstruction. Anatomy of the Large Intestine Segments: Cecum Connects to the ileum via the ileocecal valve, located in the lower right abdomen. Ascending Colon Runs upward on the right side of the abdomen to the hepatic flexure. Transverse Colon Extends horizontally across the abdomen from the hepatic flexure to the splenic flexure. Descending Colon Travels downward on the left side from the splenic flexure to the sigmoid colon. Sigmoid Colon S-shaped section connecting the descending colon to the rectum. Rectum Stores fecal matter before expulsion. Anus Terminal part of the digestive tract, through which feces are expelled. Blood and Nerve supply of the Large Intestine Arterial Supply Superior Mesenteric Artery (SMA): Supplies the cecum, ascending colon, and proximal two-thirds of the transverse colon. (Option A) Inferior Mesenteric Artery (IMA): Supplies the distal one-third of the transverse colon, descending colon, sigmoid colon, and rectum. (Option B) Marginal Artery of Drummond: An important arterial anastomosis running along the inner border of the colon, connecting branches of the SMA and IMA, ensuring continuous blood supply and providing collateral circulation. (Option C) Arc of Riolan / Meandering mesenteric artery: It is a collateral branch running close to the mesentery, connecting superior mesenteric artery to inferior mesenteric artery. It also connects proximal part of middle colic artery to left colic artery (Option D) Venous Drainage Blood from the colon drains into the superior mesenteric vein and inferior mesenteric vein , which then drain into the portal vein leading to the liver. Lymphatic Drainage Lymph from the colon drains into the mesenteric lymph nodes and ultimately into the thoracic duct. Nerve Supply Parasympathetic Supply: Vagus nerve: Up to the proximal two-thirds of the transverse colon. Pelvic splanchnic nerves: From the distal one-third of the transverse colon onward. Sympathetic Supply: Superior and inferior mesenteric plexuses.",

      },
      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "for the Assertion. Correct Answer: A) Both Assertion and Reason are true, and the Reason is the correct explanation for the Assertion. Explanation: Physiological functions of the colon Function Description Water and Electrolyte Absorption Absorbs water, sodium (Na+), and chloride (Cl-) to maintain fluid and electrolyte balance. Secretion Secretes potassium (K+), bicarbonate (HCO3-), and mucus to protect mucosa and facilitate fecal passage. Fermentation and SCFA Production Ferments dietary fibers to produce short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) like butyrate, acetate, and propionate, which serve as metabolic fuel for colon cells. The right colon, particularly the cecum, is the primary fermentation site. (Option A) Storage and Dehydration of Stool The left colon stores fecal matter and absorbs water to form solid stools. Vitamin Production Gut bacteria synthesize vitamins such as vitamin K and some B vitamins, which are absorbed by the colon. Protection and Immunity Provides a barrier against pathogens through mucus, epithelial tight junctions, and immune cells. Motility and Transit Exhibits peristaltic movements to mix contents and move them toward the rectum. Mass peristalsis propels fecal matter for defecation. Regulation of pH Absorbs SCFAs and secretes bicarbonate to maintain optimal pH for bacterial activity and colonic function. Reference: Ganong’s Review of Medical Physiology, 26th Edition, Page 476.

Clinical Features: Numerous (>100) colorectal adenomatous polyps, typically developing in adolescence or early adulthood Rectal bleeding, diarrhea, abdominal pain Extracolonic manifestations : Congenital hypertrophy of the retinal pigment epithelium (CHRPE), desmoid tumors, upper gastrointestinal polyps, epidermoid cyst (Gardner syndrome) Increased risk of other cancers: duodenal, thyroid, brain (medulloblastoma), hepatoblastoma Diagnosis: Colonoscopy showing >100 polyps and biopsy showing adenomatous variety of polyp. Treatment: The aim of Surgery in FAP is to prevent the development of colorectal cancer. Restorative proctocolectomy with an ileal pouch-anal anastomosis. Colectomy with ileorectal anastomosis (IRA) Total proctocolectomy and end-ileostomy. Crohn's disease (Option A), While it can cause rectal bleeding, it doesn't typically present with numerous polyps throughout the colon. Lynch syndrome/Hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal cancer (HNPCC) (Option C) increases cancer risk but doesn't usually cause numerous polyps. The average age of onset is later than FAP. Juvenile polyposis syndrome (Option D) can cause multiple polyps, but they are typically hamartomatous rather than adenomatous, fewer in number than FAP.",
