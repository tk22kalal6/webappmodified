Day Nutritional Mechanism 0–2 Plasmatic imbibition (diffusion) ~3 Inosculation (capillary connections form) 4–7 Neovascularization (new vessels grow in) Incorrect Options: Option A- Imbibition: Occurs during the first 24–48 hours after graft placement.The graft absorbs nutrients, oxygen, and plasma passively by diffusion from the vascular bed of the recipient site.. Option C - Neovascularization: Neovascularization involves the growth of new blood vessels into the graft from the host tissue. This process generally begins more than 5 days after the graft is placed and is crucial for sustaining the graft over the long term by providing a more robust blood supply.

Angular Dermoid Presentation It commonly occurs as a smooth, non-tender, soft swelling at the fronto-zygomatic suture. Location They are most often located near the lateral canthus , which is the outer corner of the eye where the upper and lower eyelids meet. They may also occur near suture lines of the skull. Symptoms They are usually asymptomatic unless they become large enough to cause pressure effects on adjacent structures or become infected. Diagnosis Ultrasound or CT scans may be used to evaluate the extent of the cyst, especially if deep or orbital involvement is suspected. Management (Option A) Surgical Excision: Complete surgical excision is the treatment of choice , especially if the cyst is causing cosmetic concerns or other symptoms. Careful dissection is required to ensure the cyst is fully removed and avoid recurrence. If left untreated, angular dermoids sometimes undergo resorption or indentation of the underlying base. CT is done to rule out dural attachments. Radiotherapy (Option B) is not a standard treatment for dermoid cysts . It is typically used for malignant tumours or conditions such as cancer and is not indicated for benign lesions like dermoid cysts. Antibiotics (Option C) are used for bacterial infections. They are not the treatment of choice for an uncomplicated dermoid cyst as it is non-infectious. They are only needed if the cyst becomes infected.

      "explanation": "Correct Answer: C) Keloid scar Explanation: The most probable diagnosis based on the image and the lesion that developed 6 months after heart surgery is a keloid scar . It is characterized by abnormal and excessive growth of scar tissue that grows beyond the boundaries of the original wound and does not regress. It typically appears firm, raised, and extends beyond the margins of the initial injury. Keloid formation seems to be an individual predisposition, and it is more common in African Americans. Sternum is the most common site for Keloid formation. Treatment can be done by i ntralesional injection of steroids like Triamcinolone. Hypertrophic scars (Option A) are also raised, they typically remain within the boundaries of the original injury. They may regress over time and are less likely to recur after treatment compared to keloids. Atrophic scars (Option B) are pale, flat, and depressed scars that appear sunken or as indentations in the skin due to loss of tissue or collagen. Contracture (Option D) occurs when scar tissue forms and tightens , leading to restricted movement of nearby joints or tissues. They typically occur in case of burns or deep wounds . Contractures may result in deformity and functional impairment.",

      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Correct answer: B) It rapidly progresses to malignancy Explanation: A marjolin’s ulcer usually occurs on long-standing chronic wound scars. It presents as a non-healing ulcer with elevated margins that grow rapidly. In some cases, it can become malignant and progress to squamous cell carcinoma. It is usually treated by surgical excision using Mohs surgery, where the lesion, along with a 1-2 cm margin is removed. It is seen in the site of chronic wounds or scars (Option A). This statement regarding Marjolin’s ulcer is true. It can progress to squamous cell carcinoma (Option C) It has a greater chance of progressing to squamous cell carcinoma rather than basal cell carcinoma. It is radioresistant due to avascularity (Option D). This statement is also true as Marjolin’s ulcer has less vascularity and can be radioresistant.

      "explanation": "Correct answer C) Basal cell carcinoma Explanation: Basal cell carcinoma, a slow-growing malignant tumor, invades locally and primarily affects the pilosebaceous skin. It's mainly categorised into localized and generalized forms, with nodular and nodulocystic variants comprising 90% of cases. Typically, it appears as a pink, pearly papule with telangiectasias, rolled borders, and central crusty ulcerations. Dermatofibrosarcoma (Option A) It is a soft tissue sarcoma that presents as a reddish-brown plaque that does not have rolled borders as seen in the image. Marjolin’s ulcer (Option B) Marjolin’s ulcer can develop into squamous cell carcinoma. It occurs on a previously long-standing scar. The image shown is not marjolin’s ulcer.

      "explanation": "Correct Answer: A) 33 Explanation: Pressure sores (also called decubitus ulcers or pressure ulcers ) occur due to prolonged pressure on the skin , leading to ischemia and tissue necrosis . The critical pressure threshold that exceeds capillary perfusion pressure and causes ischemia is greater than 33 mmHg . Normal capillary pressure is around 25–32 mmHg , so pressure exceeding 33 mmHg leads to inadequate blood supply and tissue damage. 45 mmHg, 54 mmHg, 67 mmHg (Option B, C and D) While higher pressures can accelerate tissue necrosis, ischemia begins at pressures just above 33 mmHg. Higher pressures are often seen in bony prominences (e.g., sacrum, heels), but even lower sustained pressure over time can lead to ulcers.

      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: A) Surgical excision Explanation : Angular dermoid is a type of dermoid cyst that commonly occurs as a smooth, non-tender, soft swelling at the fronto-zygomatic suture. The formation of an angular dermoid is due to the sequestration of ectodermal tissue during embryonic development, which gives rise to a cyst containing dermal elements like hair follicles, sebaceous glands, and sweat glands. Angular dermoids are most often located near the lateral canthus , which is the outer corner of the eye where the upper and lower eyelids meet. They may also occur near suture lines of the skull. They are usually asymptomatic unless they become large enough to cause pressure effects on adjacent structures or become infected. Diagnosis and Treatment: Imaging: Ultrasound or CT scans may be used to evaluate the extent of the cyst, especially if deep or orbital involvement is suspected. Surgical Excision: Complete surgical excision is the treatment of choice , especially if the cyst is causing cosmetic concerns or other symptoms. Careful dissection is required to ensure that the cyst is fully removed and to avoid recurrence. If left untreated, angular dermoids sometimes undergo resorption or indentation of the underlying base. CT is done to rule out dural attachments. Wait and watch (Option B) This is not recommended for angular dermoids, as they can grow or become infected. Surgical excision is the definitive treatment. Wide local excision with a 2 cm margin (Option C) A wide excision is unnecessary. Angular dermoids are benign, so simple surgical excision without wide margins is sufficient. Laser ablation (Option D) is inappropriate for treating angular dermoids. Surgical excision ensures complete removal of the cyst, preventing recurrence.

        "D": "Debridement – reconstruction – resuscitation"
      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "while fourth-degree burns extend into the muscle, bone, or internal organs. Both types of burns require prompt and aggressive treatment to prevent complications such as infection, hypovolemia, and shock. The most appropriate order of sequence in the management of a woman who has sustained third and fourth-degree burns on her back is as follows: Resuscitation: The first step in the management of severe burns is resuscitation. This involves assessing and stabilizing the patient's airway, breathing, and circulation. Intravenous fluids and electrolytes are administered to prevent hypovolemia and maintain hemodynamic stability. Debridement: Once the patient is stabilized, the next step is debridement. Debridement involves removing all necrotic tissue and debris from the wound to prevent infection and promote healing. Surgical or non-surgical methods can do debridement. Allograft or autograft: After debridement, the wound is covered with either an allograft or autograft. Allografts are skin grafts taken from another person, while autografts are skin grafts taken from the patient's own body. Both types of grafts can provide temporary coverage to the wound and promote wound healing. Therefore, the correct option would be Resuscitation – Debridement – Allograft or Autograft. Incorrect Choices: Option a. Resuscitation – reconstruction – debridement is incorrect because Ressuscitation – Debridement – Allograft or Autograft is the correct sequence. Option c: Debridement – resuscitation – autograft is incorrect because Resuscitation – Debridement – Allograft or Autograft is the correct sequence. Option d: Reconstruction is not an appropriate step in the initial management of third and fourth-degree burns, as the focus should be on stabilizing the patient and preventing complications. Reconstruction is typically done later in the treatment process once the wound has healed. Thus, Resuscitation – Debridement – Allograft or Autograft is the correct sequence. Reference: .",

The dermatome allows controlled and precise removal of the epidermis and a variable thickness of the dermis from the healthy donor area. The harvested graft is then transferred to the recipient site, where it is secured and allowed to heal. Option B - Silver's knife: Silver's knife, also known as a razor or scalpel, is a general surgical instrument used for various purposes, including making incisions and excisions. While a scalpel may be used during certain steps of the split-thickness skin grafting procedure, it is not the primary instrument for graft harvesting. Option C - Catlin amputating knife: Catlin amputating knife is a type of surgical instrument used for amputations or limb removal. It is not typically used for harvesting split-thickness skin grafts, as its design and purpose are different.",

        "D": "A keloid scar forms due to increase in the level of growth factors"
      },
      "correct_answer": "D",
      "explanation": "from an overactive healing response to an injury. A keloid scar develops from heightened levels of growth factors, resulting in excessive tissue formation beyond the boundaries of the original wound, often leading to raised, thickened scar tissue. Incorrect Options; Option A - The extent of a keloid scar can cross the wound margins: Keloid scars are characterized by their tendency to extend beyond the original wound boundaries. Unlike normal scars, which typically stay within the limits of the wound, keloids can grow and spread beyond the initial injury site. Option B - Wide excision of a keloid scar does not necessarily prevent recurrence: Keloid scars have a high recurrence rate even after surgical removal. While excision may temporarily remove the keloid, it does not guarantee that it won't reappear. Keloids have a complex and poorly understood formation process involving various factors, and surgical removal alone may not address all underlying causes. Option C - Histopathology of a keloid scar does not typically show reduced collagen and increased vascularity: Keloid scars are characterized by excessive collagen deposition, leading to the formation of raised, firm, and thickened scars. The histopathological examination of keloids typically reveals an abundance of collagen fibers in irregular arrangements. Increased vascularity is not a consistent finding in keloids.

      "explanation": "hand. If there is a significant tendon injury, such as a complete tendon laceration or avulsion, restoring the continuity and function of the tendons becomes a top priority. Tendon repair is important to regain proper hand function and dexterity. In some cases, delayed or inadequate tendon repair can result in long-term impairment of hand movement. Incorrect Options: Option B - Repair of skin cover: Skin cover refers to the integrity and closure of the skin over the injured area. Skin closure is important to prevent infection, promote wound healing, and provide a protective barrier. Depending on the severity of the hand injury, the need for skin repair or closure may vary. Superficial lacerations or abrasions may require simple wound cleaning and closure, while more complex injuries may necessitate complex wound reconstruction or grafting. Option C - Repair of nerves : Nerve injuries in the hand can result in sensory loss, motor deficits, and impaired hand function. Nerve repair or reconstruction is crucial in cases of significant nerve injury, such as complete transection or severe compression. The restoration of nerve function can help regain sensation, muscle control, and coordination in the hand. However, the prioritization of nerve repair may depend on the overall severity and complexity of the hand injury. Option D - All: It is incorrect as tendon repair is the most important factor in the repair of hand injuries. Reference: Prepladder Notes",

I ntramarginal excisio n, which involves removing the keloid while keeping the wound edges within the boundaries of the original scar, followed by radiation therapy , has shown good results in preventing keloid recurrence. Radiation helps to prevent excessive scar formation. Incorrect Options: Option A - Excisional surgery : Simple excision of the keloid without additional measures is not likely to prevent recurrence, as keloids have a high tendency to come back after surgery. Option C - Cryosurgery: Cryosurgery involves using extreme cold to destroy abnormal tissue. While it may be useful in some cases, it is generally not considered the primary treatment for recurrent keloids. Option D - Silicone gel sheeting : Silicone gel sheeting is a non-invasive treatment option that can be used to manage scars, including keloids. However, in the case of a recurrent keloid that has not responded to previous treatments, more aggressive approaches like intramarginal excision and radiation are typically required.
