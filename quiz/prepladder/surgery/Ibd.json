        "D": "Thickened bowel wall and mesenteric fat wrapping"
      },
      "correct_answer": "D",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: D) Thickened bowel wall and mesenteric fat wrapping Explanation: Thickened Bowel Wall and Mesenteric Fat Wrapping are typical features of Crohn’s disease. The bowel wall becomes thickened due to transmural inflammation, and there is often “creeping fat” around the bowel. Macroscopic features of UC and Crohn’s: Feature Ulcerative Colitis Crohn's Disease Location Rectum and colon, continuous; does not involve small intestine. Any part of the GI tract; often the terminal ileum, colon; can involve small bowel and upper GI tract. Extent Continuous inflammation; no skip lesions. Patchy inflammation with skip lesions between affected areas. Appearance Erythematous, granular mucosa; superficial ulcers. Deep, serpiginous ulcers, especially on the mesenteric side. Wall Involvement Mucosa and submucosa only. Transmural inflammation through all bowel layers. Strictures Rare. Common due to transmural inflammation and fibrosis. Fistulas Rare, usually perianal. Common, including between bowel loops and adjacent organs. Fat Wrapping Absent. Present; \"creeping fat\" around the bowel wall. Additional Features - Thickened bowel wall; thickened mesentery with enlarged lymph nodes. Images Microscopic features of ulcerative colitis and crohn’s: Feature Ulcerative Colitis Crohn's Disease Inflammation Limited to mucosa and submucosa. Transmural, affecting all bowel wall layers. Transmural Lymphoid Aggregates Inflammatory Cells Predominantly polymorphonuclear leukocytes in lamina propria. Chronic inflammation with mononuclear cells, edema, hyperemia, and lymphangiectasia. Crypt Abscesses May be present, but not unique. Can be present. Goblet Cells Mucin depletion may occur. Not specifically noted. Granulomas Absent. Present in 60%-70% of cases; non-caseating. Lymphoid Aggregates Absent unless deep ulceration is present. Present, especially in non-ulcerated areas. Crypt Architecture Often distorted with irregular branching. Not specifically noted. Images",

      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: A) Anemia Explanation: Anemia is one of the systemic signs considered in the diagnostic criteria but does not fulfill the additional systemic toxicity criteria (which are altered sensorium, dehydration, electrolyte disturbances, or hypotension). Thus, anemia alone would not be sufficient to confirm toxic megacolon when assessing the systemic toxicity criteria. Pathogenesis and Risk Factors of Toxic Megacolon Pathogenesis Colonic inflammation increases inducible nitric oxide synthase production, inhibiting smooth muscle tone and contributing to colonic dilatation. Risk Factors Ulcerative colitis (most common) Infectious colitis: particularly Clostridium difficile infection Crohn's disease Hypokalemia Antimotility agents Opiates, Anticholinergics, Antidepressants Abrupt cessation of glucocorticoids Barium enemas; Colonoscopy/bowel preparation Sulfasalazine and 5-ASA compounds can precipitate toxic megacolon Diagnosis and Evaluation of Toxic Megacolon Diagnosis Criteria Radiographic Evidence: Colonic dilation (diameter >6 cm) PLUS at least three of the following: Fever >38ºC Heart rate >120 beats/min Neutrophilic leukocytosis >10,500/microL Anemia PLUS at least one of the following: Dehydration Altered sensorium (Option B) Electrolyte disturbances (Option D) Hypotension (Option C) Differential Diagnosis Congenital megacolon (Hirschsprung's disease).

        "A": "Prednisone",
        "B": "Azathioprine",
        "C": "Infliximab",
        "D": "Budesonide"
      },
      "correct_answer": "D",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: D) Budesonide Explanation: Budesonide is a first-line treatment for inducing remission in mild to moderate Crohn's disease, especially when the disease is localized in the ileocecal region. It is a corticosteroid with a high first-pass metabolism, resulting in fewer systemic side effects than corticosteroids like prednisone. Category Mild Crohn's Disease Moderate to Severe Crohn's Disease Induction Therapy First-line : Budesonide (preferred for ileocecal disease) (Option D) or aminosalicylates (e.g., mesalamine). Prednisone for those who do not respond to budesonide. (Option A) Alternative : Enteral nutrition. First-line : Corticosteroids (e.g., prednisone for short term) or biologics Anti-TNF agents (Infliximab, Adalimumab) (Option C) Anti-integrin therapy (Vedolizumab) Anti-interleukin therapy (Ustekinumab) Combination therapy : Anti-TNF agents plus immunomodulators (Azathioprine, 6-MP) (Option B) Maintenance Therapy First-line : Continue aminosalicylates if effective. Alternative : Thiopurines (azathioprine, 6-MP) for patients intolerant to aminosalicylates. Anti-TNF monotherapy : Long-term for maintaining remission. Combination therapy : Anti-TNF agents with immunomodulators (for severe cases or history of nonresponse to biologics). Continue anti-integrin or anti-interleukin agents for those induced by these therapies Monitoring Regular follow-up to monitor symptoms and inflammation. Ileocolonoscopy 6-12 months post-remission. Drug level monitoring and fecal calprotectin to assess mucosal healing. Management of complex fistulising Crohn's disease Management Drug therapy With Abscess: Prompt surgical drainage with seton placement. Initiate anti-TNF therapy post-drainage. Without Abscess: EUA with seton placement and anti-TNF therapy combined with antibiotics. Removal of setons based on clinical response and imaging. Consider switching biologics or further surgical intervention if fistula does not heal. Initial Therapy: Anti-TNF agents + antibiotics (metronidazole or ciprofloxacin). Alternative/ Adjunctive: Thiopurines (azathioprine, 6-MP), other biologics (vedolizumab, ustekinumab, upadacitinib).

      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: A) Antibiotic therapy Explanation: The clinical scenario points to the diagnosis of pouchitis. The first line of treatment for pouchitis is antibiotic therapy. Definition: Pouchitis is an inflammatory condition affecting the ileal pouch and continent ileostomy reservoirs. It occurs in 30% to 55% of cases. Etiology: The actual etiology is unknown. It may be due to fecal stasis in the pouch, but emptying studies are not confirmatory. Clinical features: Diarrhea Hematochezia Fever Pain abdomen Malaise Investigation and diagnosis: Endoscopy and biopsy Management : First line: Antibiotic therapy using metronidazole +/- ciprofloxacin . Oral preparations or enemas can be given. In chronic pouchitis, ongoing suppressive therapy is to be given. Salicylate and corticosteroids can also be used. In case of refractory disease, normal flora in the intestine is reintroduced with the help of probiotics (Option C) and/ or an elemental diet . Biological agents (Option B) like TNF I (infliximab, vedolizumab, ustekinumab) Pouch excision (Option D) is done in cases of chronic pouchitis.

      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: B) Small intestine carcinoma Explanation: Small intestine cancers are more prone to Crohn’s disease than ulcerative colitis. Small bowel adenocarcinoma is a rare complication associated with Crohn’s disease. This is because the small bowel (ileum) is the most common part of the intestine affected by Crohn’s disease. Risk factors of carcinoma in ulcerative colitis: Pancolonic disease Duration (Long-standing disease) Dysplasias Left-sided colitis Primary sclerosing cholangitis Hereditary colon cancer Young age Features of colitis-associated carcinoma: Age group >30 years Due to prolonged colitis Develops from colitis → dysplasia → carcinoma Dysplasia seen here is flat dysplasia Pancolonic disease: multicentric and infiltrative Increased mortality Endoscopic removal or colonoscopy is done Interval cancers are possible Colon carcinoma (Option A) is a complication of both Crohn’s and ulcerative colitis with equal occurrences. Cholangiocarcinoma (Option C) is associated with ulcerative colitis. The risk factor here is primary sclerosing cholangitis. Gastric cancer (Option D) is not associated with Ulcerative colitis or Crohn’s disease. It is rather associated with chronic peptic ulcers .

      "explanation": "Correct Answer: B) Total Proctocolectomy with Ileal Pouch - Anal Anastomosis Explanation: Total Proctocolectomy with Ileal Pouch-Anal Anastomosis (TPA + IPAA) Indications: Definitive treatment for ulcerative colitis, especially in young patients. Eliminates risk of colorectal cancer and colitis-related symptoms. Pre-operative Considerations: Covering loop ileostomy is performed to protect the new pouch and aid healing. Typically done in two stages: Proctocolectomy and ileal pouch creation. Closure of the ileostomy after pouch healing. Proctocolectomy (First Stage) Remove the colon and rectum. Preserve the anal canal. ↓ Ileal Pouch Creation Create a J-shaped ileal pouch from a segment of the ileum. Connect the pouch to the anal canal (ileal pouch-anal anastomosis). ↓ Anastomosis and Ileostomy Anastomose the J-pouch to the anal canal. Perform a covering loop ileostomy to divert intestinal contents and protect the pouch. ↓ Post-operative Imaging Conduct a Gastrografin contrast enema to confirm the integrity and healing of the pouch. ↓ Closure of Ileostomy (Second Stage) Close the ileostomy once pouch healing is confirmed through imaging. ↓ Post-surgical Outcomes Monitor for adjustment to stool frequency and management of minor issues like urgency or fecal incontinence, which usually improve over time. Pouch Variations: J-pouch is most commonly used; other designs like S and W pouches are less favored due to functional outcomes. TPC + End Ileostomy (Option A) is preferred for older patients and patients with fecal incontinence. TPC + mucosectomy with hand-sewn IPAA (Option C) is a procedure done in case of the presence of rectal dysplasia. Total abdominal colectomy with very low Hartmann closure with end ileostomy (Option D) is done in more debilitating cases and those who can’t tolerate long duration of surgery.

      "explanation": "Correct Answer: D) Enteroenteric fistula Explanation: Surgery is the preferred choice of treatment in case of complications of Crohn’s disease such as tenesmus, multiple bowel movements, fulminant colitis, failure of maximum medical management and those with poor quality of life as a result of poor nutritional status. However, enteroenteric fistulas do not require surgery unless they are accompanied by notable symptoms, such as obstruction or significant discomfort. Abdominal pain caused by obstruction is also regarded as an indication for surgery. Indications of surgery in IBD: Ulcerative colitis Crohn’s disease: Failure of maximum medical therapy (Option A) Poor quality of life due to tenesmus, urgency, and low body weight. Multiple bowel movements (Option B) , poor nutritional status (Option D) , and weak physical health. Growth retardation in children or adolescents; Fulminant colitis (Option C) . Some of these cases may also have toxic megacolon. Severe colitis leads to chronic ileus and a dilated colon, both leading to an increased risk of perforation.

        "D": "Permanent fecal diversion following total colectomy"
      },
      "correct_answer": "D",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: D) Permanent fecal diversion following total colectomy Explanation: Permanent fecal diversion following total colectomy is one of the major indications for Ileostomy. An end ileostomy is indicated following total colectomy for conditions such as Rectal carcinoma or familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP). This results in a permanent stoma, where the ileum is brought to the surface, and the patient manages the stoma for life. The absence of the colon necessitates this approach, making it specific to conditions involving the entire colon removal. A colostomy can be used to relieve obstruction when resection isn't possible , such as in cases of obstructing rectal cancer or sigmoid volvulus. It helps divert stool away from the obstruction site. (Option A) A colostomy is commonly used to protect a distal anastomosis , especially after rectal surgery, by diverting fecal flow and allowing the anastomosis to heal without the risk of contamination from fecal material. (Option B) While ileostomy may sometimes be used in Crohn's and other inflammatory diseases, colostomy can also be indicated, particularly when the disease is localized to the colon and perianal regions . It helps manage fecal diversion in severe cases, allowing perianal lesions to heal. (Option C) Feature Ileostomy Colostomy Location Typically located in the right iliac fossa Typically located in the left iliac fossa Stool Consistency Usually results in liquid or semi-liquid stool Produces a more formed stool Spout Ileostomy is usually spouted Colostomy is usually flush Use To defunction the rest of the bowel in order to protect a distal anastomosis To evacuate stool from the body if the entire colon has been removed (such as in colorectal cancer, IBD) To relieve bowel obstruction To protect a distal anastomosis or allow healing away from the faecal flow Following resection when anastomosis is unsafe or not possible To relieve obstruction when resection is not feasible To reduce disease activity (e.g. Crohn’s disease) To allow alternative bowel control (incontinence) Fluid and electrolyte problems More likely Less likely Appliances Requires bags that often need to be emptied frequently due to the liquid consistency of the stool Uses appliances that may be changed as needed, depending on the type of colostomy and stool consistency Image",

      "explanation": "Correct Answer: B) Curative Explanation: The primary goal of the planned surgery, which is a total proctocolectomy with Ileal pouch-anal anastomosis (IPAA), is to cure ulcerative colitis. IPAA has become the most popular procedure for Ulcerative colitis not responding to medical therapy as well as for patients requiring colectomy for the presence of dysplasia. It significantly improves the patient's quality of life and effectively cures the colonic manifestation of ulcerative colitis I . Palliative surgery (Option A) relieves symptoms without addressing the underlying cause. While it may be used to manage severe symptoms in some cases, the primary goal of a proctocolectomy in ulcerative colitis is to remove the diseased bowel and provide a cure, not just symptom relief I . Achieving remission (Option B) refers to controlling the symptoms and inflammation with medication . Surgery, in this case, is intended to cure the disease by removing the entire diseased colon and rectum, not just to put the disease into remission I Maintenance (Option D) typically refers to ongoing medical therapy to manage the disease. In the context of high-grade dysplasia in ulcerative colitis, the surgery is performed with a curative intent to prevent cancer.

      "correct_answer": "D",
      "explanation": "continuous bleeding, and evidence of systemic toxicity. Correct Answer: D) Fulminant ulcerative colitis is characterized by >10 bowel movements daily, continuous bleeding, and evidence of systemic toxicity. Explanation: Fulminant ulcerative colitis is associated with >10 bowel movements daily, fever, tachycardia, continuous bleeding, anemia, hypoalbuminemia, abdominal tenderness and distension , the need for blood transfusion and, in the most severe cases, progressive colonic dilation ( toxic megacolon ). This is a very significant finding, suggestive of disintegrative colitis, and an indication for emergency surgery if colonic perforation is to be avoided. Backwash ileitis is a secondary inflammation in the terminal ileum, seen in some patients with pancolitis but not all ulcerative colitis patients. It involves retrograde inflammation extending 2–3 cm into the terminal ileum from the colon. Risk factors include extensive colitis and primary sclerosing cholangitis. Biopsies help distinguish backwash ileitis from Crohn's disease-related ileitis. (Option A) If inflammation is confined to the rectum (proctitis) , there are usually no systemic symptoms, and extra-alimentary manifestations are rare. The main symptoms are rectal bleeding, tenesmus and mucous discharge. (Option B) According to the severity classification, a patient with > 6 bloody stools per day and evidence of systemic illness, such as joint pain, would be classified as having severe ulcerative colitis , not moderate.

      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: B) Continuous inflammation starting from the rectum Explanation: Ulcerative colitis is characterized by inflammation that begins at the rectum and extends proximally in a continuous manner without skip lesions. This differentiates it from Crohn’s disease, which often presents with patchy inflammation and skip lesions. Ulcerative Colitis (UC) UC is an inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) characterized by chronic inflammation primarily affecting the mucosal layer of the colon. Unlike Crohn's disease, which can affect any part of the gastrointestinal tract and involves deeper bowel layers, UC is limited to the colon and involves only the mucosal layer. Contributing factors Defective mucin production: Mucosal immunological reactions Autoimmune factors (Cytotoxic T cells, anticolon antibodies) HLA DR2 association Family history Cow's milk allergy Stress and lifestyle associations Protective factors Appendicectomy Smoking Sites of involvement UC is confined to the large intestine. Always involves the rectum; extends proximally continuously. Extent of involvement: Proctitis/Proctosigmoiditis (Limited to the rectum and sigmoid colon) Left-Sided Colitis Pancolitis (Entire colon) Colonoscopy Findings Continuous inflammation from the dentate line of the rectum and extends proximally. Initially, mucosa appears erythematous, granular, or roughened; it worsens over time. Ulcers are long, serpentine, covered in fibrin, with a \"bear claw\" appearance. Significant bleeding can occur due to ulcer erosion into blood vessels. Microscopic Findings Inflammation limited to the mucosal layer Polymorphonuclear leukocytes in lamina propria. Depletion of mucin in goblet cells. Crypt abscesses contain inflammatory cells within Lieberkühn crypts. No granulomas, deep fissural ulcers, or transmural lymphoid aggregates.

Crohn's disease is a chronic, transmural inflammatory condition of the gastrointestinal (GI) tract, most commonly affecting the ileum. It presents with insidious onset, chronic diarrhoea (with loose bowel movements, rarely containing blood, pus, or mucus.), intermittent colicky abdominal pain (often in the right lower quadrant- mimics appendicitis), systemic symptoms like weight loss, and low-grade fever. The disease can affect any part of the GI tract (mouth to anus) but most frequently involves the small intestine and colon with discontinuous \"skip areas.\" Complications: Complication Description Obstruction Acute inflammation, oedema, chronic fibrotic lesions Perforation This leads to fistulas, localised abscesses, and rarely generalised peritonitis Toxic Megacolon Colonic dilation, abdominal tenderness, fever, leukocytosis Bleeding Chronic, indolent, possible massive bleeding with duodenal involvement Cancer Risk Cancer Type Risk Factors and Characteristics Small Intestine Chronic mucosal inflammation, higher relative risk M/c site in the small intestine: Ileum Colon Elevated risk with prolonged disease, dysplasia precursor Small Bowel Adenocarcinoma Aggressive, with high extracellular mucin Extraintestinal Squamous cell carcinoma (vulva, anal canal), Hodgkin and non-Hodgkin lymphomas, increased with immunomodulators Perianal Disease: Affects about 25% of Crohn’s patients, often preceding intestinal symptoms.
