      "correct_answer": "D",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: D) None of the above Explanation: Monitoring of flap failure: Clinical assessment (Option A ruled out) (gold standard)- By checking for flap skin color, turgor, surface temperature, rate of bleeding with pin-prick, and capillary refill time. Handheld Doppler (best method) - It is widely available and can be used as an adjunct to clinical methods. But it is influenced by nearby vessels and can give false results USG Color Doppler (Option B ruled out) - To assess velocity and rate of flow. Pinprick method - Flap pricked to check for perfusion (bleeding) Microdialysis (Option C ruled out) - Insertion of small catheters into subcutaneous tissue to measure metabolites such as glucose, lactate, and pyruvate at intervals. Low glucose and high lactate levels are a warning sign. Color change is one of the first signs of flap failure. CLINICAL FEATURE ARTERIAL INSUFFICIENCY VENOUS INSUFFICIENCY Temperature Cold Warm Color Pale/White Congested, Dusky/blue/purple Capillary refill Delayed Quick Pin-prick Reduced blood flow Increased blood flow Causes of flap failure: In the total failure group, venous thrombosis followed by infection and arterial thrombosis were the most common causes of failure. Poor wound healing and infection may be detrimental to local flaps and can lead to failure, especially when perfusion to flap tissue is tenuous. Reference: Redefining free flap failure",

      "explanation": "Correct Answer: C) Composite flaps Explanation: Composite flaps are defined as multiple tissue components all served by the same single vascular supply, and thereby consisting of dependent parts. Osteomyocutaneous flaps include flaps that combine bone, muscle, and skin. Examples are the radius flap with the brachioradialis muscle and skin, and the rib flap with intercostal muscles and skin, which are types of composite flaps. Conjoined flaps (Option A) are composed of several distinct, mobile segments, each with its own independent blood supply from a major branch. They are joined together through a larger common vascular source . Chimeric flaps (Option B) are several separate flaps, each with its distinct blood supply, which are connected through microanastomosis, creating a linked sequence similar to the links of a chain.",

      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: C) Radial artery forearm flap Explanation: Radial Forearm flap is an example of a free flap . Free flaps are a surgical technique allowing for the transfer of tissues like skin, muscle, bone, and fat to repair significant defects in various body parts. Free flaps involve transferring donor tissue with its blood supply (through a pedicle) to the recipient area. This contrasts with grafts, which lack their blood supply. Free flaps are suitable for: Large, deep wounds Covering exposed bone, tendon, or cartilage Cases where skin grafts have repeatedly failed Radial Forearm Free Flap uses tissue from the forearm, supplied by radial vessels. It commonly reconstructs mandible (jawbone) defects. The procedure involves meticulously dissecting the skin, a segment of the radius bone, and the brachioradialis muscle, all while preserving the radial nerve. Z-Plasty (Option A) is an example of a random flap that involves the transposition of two interdigitating triangular flaps. Pectoralis major myocutaneous flap and Deltopectoral flap (Options B and D) are examples of axial flaps. Reference: SRB's Manual of Surgery, 6th Edition, Page 319, 321-325",

      "correct_answer": "D",
      "explanation": "reconstruction of defects Correct Answer: D) Due to larger size, axial flaps require a high complexity, multi-step method for reconstruction of defects. Explanation: Axial flaps can provide a low complexity, one-step method for reconstruction for defects that are larger in area. An axial pattern flap incorporates an anatomically named vascular pedicle. Axial pattern flaps derive their blood supply directly from this fasciocutaneous artery that runs beneath the flap's longitudinal axis. (Option A ruled out) These arteries ensure blood supply to the subdermal plexus and guarantee blood supply to the flap. It allows for a larger flap design compared to random pattern flaps and delivers better cosmetic results (Option B ruled out) Examples of axial flaps include: Deltopectoral flap (Option C ruled out) Nasolabial flap off of the angular vessels Paramedian forehead flap off of the supratrochlear vessels Facial artery musculo-mucosal flap Melolabial flap Reference: SRB’s Manual of General Surgery, 6th Edition, Page 320, 321 Axial Flaps Pubmed",

      "correct_answer": "D",
      "explanation": "required Correct Answer: D) Due to the tenuous blood supply, a minimum length-width ratio of 3:1 is required. Explanation: Random flaps have a tenuous blood supply. Due to this reason, designing these flaps with a length-width ratio not exceeding 3:1 is advisable. Random pattern blood supply flaps rely on perfusion from the subdermal vascular plexus, a low-pressure system vulnerable to compromise under excessive twisting or stretching.

      },
      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer : C) Rhabdomyosarcoma histotype Explanation : Rhabdomyosarcoma histotype: Rhabdomyosarcoma is one of the few soft tissue sarcomas with a predilection for lymphatic spread, making this histotype particularly important when considering lymph node involvement. Spread of Sarcomas: Soft tissue sarcomas typically spread hematogenously to distant organs such as the lungs. However, lymphatic spread, although uncommon, is seen more frequently in certain sarcoma subtypes and under specific conditions. Sarcomas which are known to potentially spread through the lymphatic system: Rhabdomyosarcoma Synovial Sarcoma Undifferentiated Pleomorphic Liposarcoma (MFH) Angiosarcoma Epithelioid Sarcoma Clear Cell Sarcoma Liposarcoma Tumor Size >5 cm (Option A): While large size increases the overall risk of metastasis, it does not specifically predispose to lymph node involvement. High-grade histology (Option B): Similar to tumor size, high-grade tumors are more likely to metastasize, but this typically occurs via the bloodstream. Deep location relative to fascia (Option D): This factor primarily influences the potential for local invasion and hematogenous spread rather than lymphatic dissemination.

      },
      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "tumors Correct Answer: C) High likelihood of developing soft tissue sarcomas, breast cancer, and brain tumors Explanation: Li-Fraumeni syndrome is characterized by a mutation in the TP53 gene , significantly increasing the risk of various malignancies, particularly soft tissue sarcomas, breast cancer, brain tumors, and adrenocortical carcinoma. This syndrome leads to a broad spectrum of cancer risks, often manifesting at a young age. Soft tissue sarcomas are a diverse group of malignancies originating from mesenchymal tissues. Associated Syndromes with Soft Tissue Sarcomas: Syndrome Mutated Gene(s) Clinical Features Li-Fraumeni Syndrome TP53 High risk of soft tissue sarcomas, breast cancer, brain tumors, osteosarcoma, adrenocortical carcinoma, and other early-onset cancers. Neurofibromatosis Type 1 (NF1) NF1 Development of multiple neurofibromas, café-au-lait spots, and malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors. Gardner's Syndrome APC Associated with familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP), desmoid tumors (a type of aggressive fibromatosis), and colorectal cancer. Hereditary Retinoblastoma RB1 Increased risk of retinoblastoma, osteosarcoma, and other soft tissue sarcomas; typically present in childhood. Werner Syndrome WRN Premature aging, increased risk of various cancers including soft tissue sarcomas, especially in older adults. Gorlin Syndrome (NBCCS) PTCH1 Increased risk of basal cell carcinomas, jaw cysts, medulloblastomas, and rare occurrences of soft tissue sarcomas like rhabdomyosarcoma. Clinical Features of Soft Tissue Sarcomas: Lump or Mass : palpable mass, often in the extremities or trunk. Painless. Painful if the tumor is pressing on nerves or muscles. Rapid Growth in Size : Many sarcomas grow quickly over weeks to months. Tumors are often large at the time of diagnosis, with many exceeding 5 cm in diameter. Metastasis: Most common through hematogenous spread. Development of multiple benign lipomas (Option A): This is more characteristic of conditions like familial multiple lipomatosis , not Li-Fraumeni syndrome. Increased risk of developing gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GIST) (Option B): GISTs are associated with other syndromes, such as neurofibromatosis type 1 or Carney's triad, not typically with Li-Fraumeni syndrome. Predominantly risk of osteosarcoma and leukemia (Option D): While these cancers can occur in Li-Fraumeni syndrome, the broader risk includes soft tissue sarcomas, breast cancer, and brain tumors.

      "explanation": "Correct Answer: A) Surgical excision Explanation : Angular dermoid is a type of dermoid cyst that commonly occurs as a smooth, non-tender, soft swelling at the fronto-zygomatic suture. The formation of an angular dermoid is due to the sequestration of ectodermal tissue during embryonic development, which gives rise to a cyst containing dermal elements like hair follicles, sebaceous glands, and sweat glands. Angular dermoids are most often located near the lateral canthus , which is the outer corner of the eye where the upper and lower eyelids meet. They may also occur near suture lines of the skull. They are usually asymptomatic unless they become large enough to cause pressure effects on adjacent structures or become infected. Diagnosis and Treatment: Imaging: Ultrasound or CT scans may be used to evaluate the extent of the cyst, especially if deep or orbital involvement is suspected. Surgical Excision: Complete surgical excision is the treatment of choice , especially if the cyst is causing cosmetic concerns or other symptoms.

      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: A) Imbibition Explanation: During the imbibition phase , which occurs within the first 24-48 hours, the graft survives through the diffusion of nutrients and plasma from the recipient bed. The process of skin graft healing is called “Skin graft Take.” The phases of graft take involve a series of 3 steps critical for the successful integration of a graft into the recipient site. These phases are: Serum Imbibition (Plasmatic Circulation): In the first 48 hours, the graft is sustained by plasma exudate from the capillaries in the host bed. Revascularization (Option C ruled out) : After 48 hours, two key processes commence. Neovascularization , where new blood vessels grow from the recipient site into the graft, and inosculation , where graft and host vessels form direct connections. Organization: This phase begins immediately after grafting, with a fibrin layer forming at the graft-bed interface to stabilize the graft. By day 7, this layer is replaced by fibroblasts, and by days 10 to 14, the graft is typically well-adhered to the underlying bed. Inflammation (Option B) is a general response to injury but is not a phase of graft take. Imbibition, not inflammation, occurs within the first 24 hours. Maturation (Option D) happens weeks to months after grafting. It is too late to be the phase occurring within 24 hours. Reference: Sabiston Textbook of Surgery, 21st Edition, Page 1917",

It involves the serial excision of the tumor in small increments with immediate microscopic analysis of each layer to ensure complete removal of cancerous tissue. Pathology: Most Common Variety of SCC : Ulcerative type Histopathology Findings : Presence of cell nests, epithelial pearls, and keratin pearls Clinical Features: Appearance: Nodules or ulcers Characteristics : Everted edges with indurated (hardened) bases Investigation: Preferred Diagnostic Method: Wedge biopsy Treatment: For Small or Non-invasive SCCs: Wide local excision , typically with a 2 cm margin (Option C) For Large, Aggressive, or Recurrent Tumors, or those in Vital/Cosmetic Areas: Mohs Micrographic Surgery Cryotherapy (Option A): involves freezing the tumor with liquid nitrogen. Used for superficial skin cancers or precancerous lesions. Electrodesiccation and curettage (Option B) involve scraping away the cancerous tissue and using an electrical current. This method is generally used for superficial skin cancers. Reference: SRB's Manual of Surgery, 6th Edition, Page 281-283",

      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: C) Sunlight Exposure Explanation: Sunlight exposure is the most common and significant cause of squamous cell carcinoma of the skin. UV radiation from the sun causes direct DNA damage to skin cells, leading to mutations and increased risk of developing SCC. Squamous Cell Carcinoma (SCC) Also known as epidermoid carcinoma. It is the second most common type of skin cancer. It is particularly prevalent among individuals with fairer skin. It is the most common cancer in darker-skinned individuals. The cancer originates from the prickle cell layer of the epidermis. A defining characteristic of SCC is its tendency to migrate outward toward the skin's surface, often with everted edges. The primary cause of SCC is prolonged exposure to sunlight. The most commonly involved areas are (parts exposed to sunlight) Ears, Cheeks, Lower lip, and back of hands. Predisposing Factors: Actinic keratosis (senile keratosis) Prolonged sunlight exposure Radiation exposure (Option D ruled out) Infection with Human Papillomavirus (HPV) Immunosuppression or HIV Exposure to arsenic (Option B ruled out) Bowen’s disease Tobacco use (Option A ruled out) Xeroderma pigmentosa Reference: SRB's Manual of Surgery , 6th Edition, Page 281-282",

      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: B) Wedge Biopsy Explanation: A wedge biopsy is the preferred method for diagnosing basal cell carcinoma because it allows examination of the edges where the cancer is likely to be most active, providing a more comprehensive assessment of the lesion's extent and ensuring that the entire affected area is evaluated. Basal Cell Carcinoma (BCC): Also known as Rodent Ulcer . Locally invasive , meaning it destroys surrounding tissues. Referred to as Tear Cancer, as it occurs typically above a line drawn from the ear lobule to the corner of the mouth. Originates from the basal layer of the epidermis . The most common site is the nose, with the inner canthus being another frequent location. Types of BCC (based on pathology): Nodular: The most common type. Appears as small, slow-growing pearly nodules. Characterized by telangiectatic vessels on the surface. Notable for a central depression called umbilication It can also be pigmented. Cystic Superficial Management: For non-aggressive tumors on the trunk or extremities, wide local excision with a 2 cm margin is usually sufficient. For large, aggressive tumors affecting vital or cosmetic areas, or recurrent tumors, Mohs micrographic surgery is recommended. Punch Biopsy (Option A) does not provide information regarding the margins of the lesion or its depth. Excisional Biopsy (Option C) involves removing the entire lesion and surrounding tissue but a wedge biopsy is preferred over an excisional biopsy.",

        "A": "Enhanced cosmetic appearance",
        "B": "Coverage of a large area with minimal donor skin",
        "C": "Reduced risk of secondary contraction",
        "D": "Decreased need for vascularization"
      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: B) Coverage of a large area with minimal donor skin Explanation: A meshed split-thickness skin graft (STSG) is particularly advantageous in cases of extensive burns because it allows for the expansion of the graft over a larger surface area with limited donor skin. By creating tiny splits in the graft, the skin can be stretched, enabling it to cover more extensive areas, which is critical in managing large burn wounds. These splits also facilitate fluid egress, which helps the graft conform to the wound bed, ensuring better contour matching. The ideal meshing ratio typically ranges from 1:1.5 to 1:6 , depending on the area that needs coverage. Despite its utility, the meshed skin graft has some drawbacks, including a less favorable cosmetic appearance due to the visible mesh pattern and a higher degree of secondary contraction , which can lead to scarring . Enhanced cosmetic appearance (Option A) : While meshed skin grafts are effective for large-area coverage, they often result in poor cosmetic outcomes due to the visible mesh pattern and increased secondary contraction. Reduced risk of secondary contraction (Option C) : Meshed grafts actually have a higher risk of secondary contraction, which can affect the cosmetic outcome. Decreased need for vascularization (Option D) : Vascularization is essential for the graft to take properly and ensure its integration with the wound bed.",

        "C": "Infection",
        "D": "Poor cosmetic outcome"
      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: B) Hematoma or seroma formation Explanation: In this scenario, the accumulation of fluid beneath the graft is indicative of hematoma or seroma formation. This complication can prevent proper adherence of the graft to the wound bed, leading to graft failure if not addressed promptly. Hematomas are collections of blood, while seromas are accumulations of clear fluid. Both can occur when there is inadequate hemostasis or when there is excessive movement or pressure on the graft site post-operatively. Complications of Skin Grafting: Graft Failure (Option A) : This occurs when the graft does not survive or integrate with the recipient site, due to poor vascularization or improper placement. It is not characterized by fluid accumulation beneath the graft. It can be prevented by ensuring good contact between the graft and the wound bed and avoiding movement or pressure on the graft. Infection (Option C) : Infection typically presents with redness, warmth, and pus rather than just fluid accumulation. Strict sterile techniques during surgery and the use of prophylactic antibiotics can help prevent infections. Hematoma or Seroma Formation (Option B) : These complications occur when blood or fluid collects under the graft. Proper hemostasis during surgery and the use of drains can prevent this issue. Poor Cosmetic Outcome (Option D) : If the graft does not match the recipient site's skin texture or thickness, or if it is not placed correctly, the cosmetic result may be unsatisfactory. Careful selection of graft thickness and meticulous placement can help achieve a better aesthetic outcome. Reference: Sabiston Textbook of Surgery, 21st Edition, Page 1917",
