Reduced renal blood flow and GFR lead to oliguria which may lead to anuria. Cerebral blood flow is reduced leading to drowsiness and confusion. Tachypnoea - due to lactic acidosis Tachycardia Weak thready pulse Sweating Option B : In Distributive shock , there will be systemic vasodilation leading to organ hypoperfusion as seen mainly in anaphylaxis due to histamine release, sepsis due to the release of bacterial products Option C : Neurogenic shock refers to reduced tissue perfusion due to loss of vasomotor tone to peripheral arterial beds. It usually occurs secondary to spinal cord injury Option D : Cardiogenic shock is due to the primary failure of the heart to pump blood. It may be due to myocardial infarction, cardiomyopathy, or blunt myocardial injury",

Septic shock is initiated by -bacteria, fungi, and viruses (Option B) Pathophysiology of Septic Shock Infection (insult/injury) ↓ Release of inflammatory mediators ↓ Systemic inflammatory response ↓ Diffuse endothelial injury, vasodilation, and increased capillary permeability ↓ Progressive vasodilation and maldistribution of blood flow ↓ Organ hypoperfusion ↓ Multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS) Clinical Features: Fever.

      "question": "A 42-year-old man is brought after a high-impact motor vehicle accident. On examination, he has a spinal cord injury at the level of T6 with flaccid paralysis of the lower extremities. His vital signs show hypotension, bradycardia, and warm, flushed skin.

        "A": "Decreased cardiac output",

        "D": "Decreased peripheral vascular resistance"
      },
      "correct_answer": "D",
      "explanation": "neurogenic shock, there is a loss of sympathetic tone leading to vasodilation of the peripheral vasculature, resulting in decreased peripheral vascular resistance and hypotension. This is the primary mechanism underlying neurogenic shock. Causes: Neurogenic shock is a critical condition that results from the dysregulation of the autonomic nervous system following spinal cord injury, especially in the cervical and upper thoracic vertebrae above the T6 level, as a result of traumatic events. The dysregulation arises due to the lack of sympathetic tone and decreased peripheral vascular resistance (Option D) The decline in sympathetic tone prompts the dilation of capacitance blood vessels in the lower extremities. This, in turn, results in decreased cardiac filling, leading to hypotension and shock. Reduced sympathetic control over the heart leads to a situation where unopposed vagal cardiac influence causes bradycardia. Patients with neurogenic shock may also exhibit pink and warm skin due to the dilation of subcutaneous blood vessels. Severe brain injury Certain anesthetics Pathophysiology Clinical Manifestations: Hypotension Bradycardia (unlike other forms of shock) Warm, dry skin below injury level Priapism in males Respiratory compromise (if high cervical injury) Poikilothermia (inability to regulate body temperature) Decreased cardiac output (Option A) : In neurogenic shock, the cardiac output is usually maintained or increased due to the loss of sympathetic vasoconstrictor tone. Decreased blood volume (Option B) : Neurogenic shock is not associated with decreased blood volume, unlike hypovolemic shock. Increased vascular permeability (Option C) : is more characteristic of distributive shock like septic shock, not neurogenic shock.",

        "D": "Panhypopituitarism"
      },
      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "insufficiency , is characterized by the destruction of the adrenal cortex, leading to deficient production of cortisol and aldosterone. In an acute crisis, patients present with severe hypotension, electrolyte imbalances (low sodium, high potassium), hypoglycemia, and dehydration, which are all seen in this patient. Diffuse skin hyperpigmentation occurs due to increased ACTH levels stimulating melanocytes, which is a hallmark of Addison's disease. Clinical features: Hypotension, shock resistant to fluid resuscitation Nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain Weakness, fatigue Confusion, delirium Fever (may be absent in the elderly) Laboratory findings: Hyponatremia, hyperkalemia Hypoglycemia Metabolic acidosis Low serum cortisol (< 18 µ g/dL is suggestive, < 3 µ g/dL is diagnostic in stressed patients) Management: Immediate hydrocortisone: 100 mg IV bolus, followed by 50-100 mg every 6-8 hours Fluid resuscitation: Normal saline 1-2 L in first hour, then as needed Glucose administration if hypoglycemic Treat precipitating factors (e.g., infection) Subsequent evaluation: Once stabilized, perform ACTH stimulation test to confirm diagnosis Measure plasma ACTH to differentiate primary from secondary adrenal insufficiency Investigate underlying cause (e.g., autoimmune, infectious, malignant) Long-term management: Daily glucocorticoid and mineralocorticoid replacement Patient education on stress dosing and emergency management Diabetic ketoacidosis (Option A) typically presents with hyperglycemia, not hypoglycemia. The electrolyte pattern and skin hyperpigmentation are not consistent with DKA. Septic shock (Option B) can cause hypotension and tachycardia, but doesn't explain electrolyte abnormalities, or skin hyperpigmentation. Septic shock typically causes hyperglycemia, not hypoglycemia. Panhypopituitarism (Option D) can cause secondary adrenal insufficiency, but it wouldn't result in skin hyperpigmentation (due to low ACTH levels). Also, the electrolyte abnormalities are typically less severe in secondary adrenal insufficiency because aldosterone production is usually preserved.

The initial management should focus on fluid resuscitation with normal saline, as it is the preferred crystalloid for volume replacement in shock.

Parameters used to assess shock Parameter Normal/Target Value Shock Indicator Clinical Significance Blood Pressure (Systolic BP) ≥ 90 mmHg < 90 mmHg or a drop > 40 mmHg from baseline Indicates hypotension and decreased perfusion to vital organs. Mean Arterial Pressure (MAP) > 65 mmHg < 65 mmHg MAP below 65 mmHg may result in inadequate organ perfusion. Heart Rate (HR) 60-100 bpm > 100 bpm Tachycardia is a compensatory response to maintain perfusion. Urine Output ≥ 0.5 mL/kg/hour < 0.5 mL/kg/hour Low urine output indicates renal hypoperfusion. Lactate Levels 0.5-1 mmol/L > 2 mmol/L Elevated lactate suggests anaerobic metabolism and hypoxia. Central Venous Oxygen Saturation (ScvO2) 70-75% < 70% Indicates imbalance between oxygen delivery and consumption. Skin Temperature & Capillary Refill Warm, capillary refill < 2 seconds Cold, clammy skin, capillary refill > 2 seconds Suggests poor peripheral perfusion and possible shock.
