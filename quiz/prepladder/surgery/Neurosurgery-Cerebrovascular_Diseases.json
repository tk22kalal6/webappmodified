      },
      "correct_answer": "D",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: D) Includes spinal cord tissue within the protruding sac. Explanation: Myelomeningocele involves the herniation of the spinal cord, meninges, and cerebrospinal fluid through a vertebral defect. The presence of spinal cord tissue within the sac differentiates myelomeningocele from other forms of spina bifida, such as meningocele , in which only the meninges and cerebrospinal fluid are present in the sac without spinal cord involvement. Feature Meningocele Myelomeningocele Definition Protrusion of meninges through a vertebral defect (Option A) Protrusion of meninges and spinal cord through a vertebral defect (Option D) Sac contents Cerebrospinal fluid only. Cerebrospinal fluid and neural tissue. Neural involvement No neural elements in the sac (Option B) Spinal cord and/or nerve roots in the sac Skin coverage Often covered by skin Usually not covered by skin (open lesion) Neurological deficits Typically mild or absent Often severe Hydrocephalus risk Lower risk Higher risk Prognosis Generally better (Option C) Generally worse Surgical complexity Less complex More complex Long-term complications Fewer More frequent and severe Associated anomalies Less common More common",

      "question": "A 58-year-old patient presents with a significant right-sided brain tumour. During the neurological examination, the patient exhibits left-sided weakness. Which of the following best accounts for this presentation?",
      "options": {
        "A": "Kernohan notch phenomenon",

        "D": "Uhthoff's phenomenon"
      },
      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: A) Kernohan notch phenomenon Explanation: Kernohan's notch phenomenon involves the compression of the contralateral cerebral peduncle due to a brain mass effect, leading to motor deficits on the opposite side. Mechanism: Cerebral Peduncle Compression: A brain mass, often associated with transtentorial or uncal herniation, exerts pressure on the contralateral (opposite side) cerebral peduncle. Tentorium Interaction: This compression happens against the free edge of the tentorium cerebelli, creating an indentation or \"notch\" in the cerebral peduncle. Clinical Presentation: Contralateral Hemiparesis: Due to damage to motor pathways in the contralateral cerebral peduncle. Ipsilateral Ocular Symptoms: If the herniation affects the oculomotor nerve (cranial nerve III) on the same side as the mass, it may lead to ipsilateral (same side) oculomotor nerve palsy. Brown-Sequard Syndrome (Option B) involves damage to one side of the spinal cord, leading to specific patterns of sensory and motor deficits which don’t match the brain tumor scenario. Tullio Phenomenon (Option C) is associated with inner ear disorders causing dizziness and hearing problems, and it is not relevant to motor deficits from a brain tumor. Uhthoff's Phenomenon (Option D) involves the worsening of neurological symptoms with heat in conditions like multiple sclerosis, which is not related to a brain tumor's mass effect.",

      "question": "A 62-year-old man is brought to the emergency department after a fall from a ladder. He has a GCS score of 9 (E2V3M4), and his right pupil is dilated and nonreactive.

        "A": "Subfalcine herniation",
        "B": "Tonsillar herniation",
        "C": "Upward transtentorial herniation",
        "D": "Uncal herniation"
      },
      "correct_answer": "D",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: D) Uncal herniation Explanation: The patient is most likely experiencing uncal herniation based on the following findings: Large Right-Sided Subdural Hematoma: Creates a space-occupying lesion, leading to significant mass effect. Significant Midline Shift to the Left : Indicates severe displacement of brain structures. Dilated and Nonreactive Right Pupil: A classic sign of uncal herniation due to oculomotor nerve compression. Decreased Level of Consciousness (GCS 9): Resulting from brainstem compression. Signs of Cushing's Triad: I ncluding hypertension, bradycardia, and irregular breathing, indicative of increased intracranial pressure. Uncal herniation occurs when the medial temporal lobe (uncus) is displaced downward through the tentorial notch, compressing the ipsilateral oculomotor nerve and brainstem . Subfalcine herniation(Option A) typically causes contralateral leg weakness but not pupillary changes. Tonsillar herniation(Option B) primarily affects the lower brainstem and cervical spinal cord. Upward transtentorial herniation(Option C) is rare and usually occurs with infratentorial lesions.",

      "question": "A 62-year-old man undergoes emergent decompressive craniectomy for a large right hemispheric infarct with significant mass effect. Post-surgery, he remains comatose and, six hours later, develops pinpoint pupils and irregular breathing. A stat CT scan shows resolution of the midline shift but reveals new bilateral hyperdense lesions in the midbrain. What is the most likely explanation for these new CT findings?",

        "A": "Contrast extravasation",
        "B": "Hemorrhagic transformation of infarct",
        "C": "Duret haemorrhage",
        "D": "Hypertensive microbleeds"
      },
      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: C) Duret hemorrhage Explanation: The new CT findings are most consistent with Duret haemorrhage , characterised by small, linear or flame-shaped haemorrhages primarily in the midbrain and upper pons. It is typically caused by the rapid displacement of the brainstem, which can occur due to significant mass effects or sudden changes in intracranial pressure, such as those seen after decompressive surgery. This results from stretching and tearing the perforating branches of the basilar artery. Clinically present with persistent coma, pinpoint pupils, and irregular breathing suggest brainstem dysfunction, suggesting brainstem dysfunction. Contrast extravasation (Option A) would be unusual without recent contrast administration and typically doesn't present with bilateral midbrain lesions. Hemorrhagic transformation of infarct (Option B) : While possible, this would typically occur in the area of the original infarct (right hemisphere), not in the midbrain. Hypertensive microbleeds (Option D) usually occur over time and are more commonly found in other areas of the brain, not specifically bilateral in the midbrain.
