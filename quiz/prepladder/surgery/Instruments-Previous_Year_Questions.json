      },
      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: A) Mixter Forceps Explanation: The instrument shown in the image is a Mixter forceps , frequently used in surgical procedures for grasping and handling delicate tissues. Mixter forceps are particularly useful for achieving hemostasis during surgery. They feature a distinct curved design and serrated jaws with cross grooves, which ensure a firm grip on tissues while being manipulated during surgery. Instrument Image Description Rampley's Sponge Holding Forceps (Option B) Designed in a scissor-like configuration, featuring ratcheted handles with serrated looped jaws . Used to handle gauze or sponges. Used to hold gall bladder/cervix/tongue etc., during operative procedures. Kocher’s Forceps (Option C) Serrations in the distal blades with an opposing tooth at the tip. Holds tissues or pedicles securely, preventing slippage and retraction of vessels or bleeders. Types: Straight/Curved. Small/medium/large. Used in thyroidectomy, hemorrhoidectomy, mastectomy, polypectomy, and hysterectomy . Used to secure tough or fibrous tissues in areas like the palms, soles, and scalp to prevent vessel retraction during surgery. Holds gauze and gauze pellets. Toothed Forceps Used to hold skin and tough structures like fascia and aponeurosis. Not used for delicate structures like the bowel, vessels, or nerves. May have one-in-two or two-in-three teeth. Adson’s Forceps (Option D) : Small, fine forceps for delicate work; can be toothed or non-toothed. Victor–Bonney’s Forceps : Heavy-toothed dissecting forceps.",

      "question": "Please determine the instrument provided.",
      "options": {
        "A": "Linear stapler",
        "B": "Skin stapler",
        "C": "Circular stapler",
        "D": "Curved stapler"
      },
      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: A) Linear stapler Explanation: The instrument shown in the image is a Linear Stapler . It consists of a handle, shaft, anvil, and stapling cartridge. Uses: Side to side anastomoses. Ends are closed by transverse staple. To close the bowel either completely or partially. Skin stapler (Option B) is used for closing skin wounds, not internal tissues, and does not create the straight-line closure typical of a linear stapler. Circular stapler, also called EEA stapler (End to End Anastomosis) (Option C) is used for anastomosis of tubular structures like the bowel or blood vessels, creating a circular stapling line. It is not suitable for straight-line stapling, which is the function of a linear stapler. Curved stapler (Option D) is used for hard-to-reach areas, typically in the gastrointestinal tract, but like the circular stapler, it does not create a straight-line closure, which is the purpose of a linear stapler.",

      "question": "Which of the following are used to stop oesophagal variceal bleeding?",
      "options": {
        "A": "A, B & C",
        "B": "A and B only",
        "C": "A, Band C",
        "D": "A, B and D"
      },
      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: A) A, B & C Explanation: A) Sengstaken Blakemore Tube: (Option A) Its primary use is Balloon tamponade for controlling variceal bleeding in the oesophagus and stomach. It is also called a four-lumen Minnesota tube or Linton's tube or Modified 4 lumen Pitcher tube. It contains a gastric balloon, esophageal balloon, gastric aspiration port and esophageal aspiration port. B) Minnesota tube: (Option A) It is similar to the Sengstaken-Blakemore tube and is used to control upper GI bleeding, including oesophagal varices, by balloon tamponade. C) Upper GI endoscopy: (Option A) It is a crucial tool in managing oesophagal variceal bleeding. While it doesn't directly stop the bleeding, it allows for visualisation of the varices and enables interventions such as band ligation or sclerotherapy to control the bleeding. D) Monopolar cautery: It involves the use of electric current to coagulate and stop bleeding from varices. It can be used during endoscopic procedures to target specific bleeding points.",
