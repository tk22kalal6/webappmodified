        "D": "Trastuzumab therapy"
      },
      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "Correct answer A) Adjuvant Radiotherapy Explanation: After breast conservation surgery for high nuclear-grade DCIS with necrosis and margin clearance, adjuvant radiotherapy is the appropriate choice. DCIS, a non-invasive breast cancer type, involves abnormal cells within breast ducts but not spreading outside. High nuclear grade DCIS with necrosis signifies a more aggressive form. Margin clearance of 10mm confirms absence of cancer cells around the tumor, lowering local recurrence risk. Adjuvant radiotherapy targets any remaining cancer cells in breast tissue, further reducing recurrence risk, notably ipsilateral. Adjuvant Chemotherapy (Option B) Not typically recommended for DCIS, reserved for invasive breast cancer. Follow up 6 monthly for 2 years and then yearly follow up (Option C) While follow-ups are crucial post-treatment, adjuvant radiotherapy is necessary here to minimize recurrence risk. Trastuzumab Therapy (Option D) Targeted for HER2-positive invasive breast cancer, not typically indicated for HER2-negative DCIS. Reserved for cases with HER2 overexpression, typically invasive cancers.

      "explanation": "cancer, accounting for around 70-80% of all cases. It develops from the cells that line the milk ducts and can invade surrounding tissues. Squamous metaplasia is a benign breast condition that is characterized by a change in the normal breast tissue cells to a squamous cell type. Squamous metaplasia is not considered a risk factor for developing breast cancer. Incorrect Choices: Option a: Florid epithelial hyperplasia is a benign breast condition that is characterized by an overgrowth of cells in the ducts and lobules of the breast. While florid epithelial hyperplasia is not cancerous, it can be a risk factor for developing breast cancer. Option b: Papilloma with fibrovascular core is a benign growth that develops in the ducts of the breast. It is usually small and does not cause any symptoms, but in some cases, it can cause nipple discharge. Like florid epithelial hyperplasia, a papilloma can be a risk factor for developing breast cancer. Option c: atypical hyperplasia is a benign breast condition that is characterized by abnormal growth of cells in the ducts and lobules of the breast. Atypical hyperplasia is considered a high-risk lesion and is associated with an increased risk of developing breast cancer. Reference: .",

      "question": "What is the probable diagnosis for a 30-year-old woman who complains of a painless mass in her left breast that can be felt? The mass is highly movable, measures 3 x 3 cm, and has a rubbery texture.",
      "options": {
        "A": "Breast abscess",

      },
      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "breast tumors that are common in women between the ages of 20 and 40. They are made up of glandular and connective tissue and are often hormone-responsive, meaning they can change in size with hormonal fluctuations. On examination, fibroadenomas typically present as a well-circumscribed, mobile, and painless mass in the breast. They are usually rubbery or firm in consistency and can vary in size. Incorrect Choices: Option a: Breast abscesses, on the other hand, are typically associated with redness, warmth, and tenderness in the breast, as well as fever and other signs of infection. Option b: Phyllodes tumors are another type of breast tumor that can be mistaken for a fibroadenoma, but they tend to be larger in size and have a more irregular shape. Option d: : IDC often presents as a breast lump, which may feel hard or have an irregular shape, but it is typically not as mobile or well-circumscribed as a fibroadenoma. IDC may cause the nipple to become inverted or to produce discharge. Invasive ductal carcinoma is not typically associated with redness, warmth, or tenderness in the breast",

      "question": "What preoperative intervention can be administered to minimise intraoperative bleeding in a 32-year-old female patient diagnosed with Grave's disease, presenting with eye symptoms and an enlarged thyroid, who is scheduled to undergo a total thyroidectomy?",
      "options": {
        "A": "Potassium iodide",

        "C": "Propylthiouracil",
        "D": "Betamethasone"
      },
      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: A) Potassium iodide Explanation: The most appropriate preoperative intervention to minimise intraoperative bleeding in a patient with Grave's disease scheduled for a total thyroidectomy is Potassium Iodide . It reduces thyroid vascularity and size, helping minimise bleeding during surgery. Mechanism: It inhibits thyroid hormone synthesis and decreases the thyroid gland's vascularity. Lugol’s Iodine It is a Saturated Potassium Iodide Solution (5% iodine + 10% potassium iodide) Dose : 3 drops TID for 7-10 days. Role: Reduce Vascularity: Used pre-operatively to reduce the vascularity of the thyroid gland. This helps in minimising bleeding during surgery and prevents complications. (Option A) Prevent Thyroid Storm: Decreasing vascularity also helps prevent thyroid storms, which can occur if there is an excessive release of thyroid hormones during or after surgery. Iodine's Effect: Iodine has a transient effect on thyroid function by inhibiting the release of thyroid hormones from the thyroid gland. This phenomenon is known as the Wolff-Chaikoff effect . In Toxic Multinodular Goiter , Lugol's iodine may not achieve the goal of temporary euthyroidism and instead may exacerbate hyperthyroidism due to the Jod-Basedow phenomenon. Propranolol (Option B) is a beta-blocker that can be used to manage the symptoms of hyperthyroidism, such as tremors, palpitations, and anxiety. It does not affect thyroid vascularity or directly reduce intraoperative bleeding. Propylthiouracil (PTU) (Option C) is an anti-thyroid medication used in the management of hyperthyroidism (by inhibiting thyroid hormone production) but does not reduce thyroid vascularity or intraoperative bleeding. Betamethasone (Option D) is a corticosteroid that has anti-inflammatory and immunosuppressive properties. It can be used for inflammation and immune suppression but does not reduce thyroid vascularity or intraoperative bleeding in thyroid surgery.

Risk Factors Childhood radiation exposure, BRAF & RET/PTC mutations, family history. Spread Lymphatic spread (cervical lymph nodes commonly affected). Clinical Features Painless thyroid nodule, cervical lymphadenopathy, euthyroid state. Histopathology Orphan Annie eye nuclei, Psammoma bodies, Nuclear grooves, Papillary structures with fibrovascular cores. Diagnosis 1. Ultrasound – Microcalcifications, hypoechoic nodule, irregular margins. 2. FNAC – First-line test. Treatment 1. Total thyroidectomy (>1 cm, multifocal, lymph node involvement). 2. Lobectomy (<1 cm, no metastasis). 3. RAI therapy (for residual disease or metastasis). 4. TSH suppression therapy (Levothyroxine). Prognosis Excellent (>95% 10-year survival). Worse with older age, distant metastasis, large tumor size, BRAF mutation. Follicular Carcinoma (Option B) Hematogenous spread (not lymphatic like PTC) FNAC cannot differentiate follicular adenoma vs. carcinoma (requires capsular/vascular invasion assessment on histology). Medullary Carcinoma (Option C) Derived from parafollicular C cells (calcitonin-secreting). FNAC shows amyloid deposits (Congo red positive) and polygonal/spindle cells. Associated with MEN 2A/2B mutations (RET oncogene). Anaplastic Carcinoma (Option D) Highly aggressive with rapid growth, dysphagia, and hoarseness. FNAC shows pleomorphic giant cells, mitotic figures, and necrosis. Reference: Harrison's principles of internal medicine, 21st Edition, Page: 2951",

      },
      "correct_answer": "D",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: D) 1 & 3 Explanation: The most appropriate course of action in this case is to first perform mammography , followed by a biopsy of the breast mass to confirm whether it is malignant. Mammography: It is the gold standard for evaluating suspicious breast masses. In this case, it helps assess the mass’s characteristics (e.g., shape, edges, density) and detect any other lesions in the contralateral breast, which is important given the patient's age and increased breast cancer risk. Biopsy of the breast mass: It is crucial to determine if the mass is malignant or benign (FNA or core needle). It provides tissue for histopathological examination, which guides treatment decisions based on tumour type, grade, and receptor status. Triple assessment is a combination of assessments used for breast cancer screening and diagnosis. Triple Assessment of Breast Examination 1. Clinical Examination Objective: Identify lumps, skin changes, nipple discharge, or lymphadenopathy. Procedure: Palpation of breasts and lymph nodes. 2. Imaging Methods: Mammography: Preferred for women over 40. Ultrasound: Used in younger women or for further evaluation. 3. Biopsy Types: FNA: Minimally invasive; used for cystic lesions. Core Needle: Preferred for solid masses. Excisional: Removes lump for examination. Triple assessment yields more accurate results than individual assessment. PET Scan (Statement 2) is generally used for staging or detecting distant metastasis after a diagnosis of breast cancer is confirmed. It is not normally employed in the initial workup of a palpable breast mass. USG-guided biopsy of the lymph node (Statement 4) is not done in cases of clinically palpable axillary nodes.

      "explanation": "Correct Answer: B) Endometrial cancer Explanation : Tamoxifen is a selective estrogen receptor modulator (SERM) used in the treatment of breast cancer, which has a potential risk for endometrial cancer. While it is effective at preventing estrogen from binding to receptors in breast tissue, it can act as an estrogen agonist in the endometrium. Prolonged use of Tamoxifen leads to endometrial hyperplasia , which is a significant risk factor for developing endometrial cancer. Ovarian cancer (Option A): Tamoxifen does not significantly increase the risk of ovarian cancer. Breast cancer on the other side (Option C): Tamoxifen reduces the risk of contralateral breast cancer by blocking estrogen receptors in the breast tissue, hence lowering the risk. Cervical cancer (Option D): There is no direct association between tamoxifen use and an increased risk of cervical cancer. Reference: William's Gynaecology, 4th Edition, Page 699.",

      },
      "correct_answer": "D",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: D) Hashimoto's thyroiditis Explanation: Hashimoto's Thyroiditis is an autoimmune hypothyroid condition presenting with high TSH and low T3/T4. In Hashimoto's thyroiditis, the immune system mistakenly targets the thyroid gland, leading to chronic inflammation and damage. Antibodies play a crucial role in this process, Anti-Thyroid Peroxidase (TPO) Antibodies: Target an enzyme called thyroid peroxidase, which helps synthesise thyroid hormones. They are a hallmark of Hashimoto's thyroiditis and are frequently elevated in affected individuals. Anti-Thyroglobulin(Tg) Antibodies: Thyroglobulin is a protein involved in thyroid hormone production. Antibodies against thyroglobulin can disrupt hormone synthesis and contribute to thyroid gland damage. These antibodies and other immune cells contribute to the characteristic features of Hashimoto's thyroiditis, including thyroid gland enlargement, decreased thyroid hormone production, and symptoms of hypothyroidism. Hypoparathyroidism (Option A) is a condition where there is an underproduction of parathyroid hormone (PTH), leading to low blood calcium levels. It involves low PTH levels and affects calcium balance, but it is not related to thyroid hormone levels. Pituitary Adenoma (Option B) is a benign tumour of the pituitary gland that can affect its ability to produce hormones, including TSH. It can cause secondary hypothyroidism by not secreting enough TSH, but the given scenario is suggestive of primary hypothyroidism, not secondary (also called central hypothyroidism: Low TSH, T3, and T4 levels ). Grave's disease (Option C) is an autoimmune disorder that causes hyperthyroidism, which leads to elevated T4 and suppressed TSH , not low T4 and high TSH. Therefore, this is the opposite of what is presented in the question. Reference: Harrison’s principle of Internal Medicine, 21st Edition, Page 2934.

      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: A) Inflammatory carcinoma Explanation: The presentation of the patient, along with redness and swelling of the right breast with a mobile lump, is suggestive of Inflammatory breast carcinoma. It is a rare but aggressive form of breast cancer characterised by pain, redness, swelling , and warmth of the breast. In I nflammatory breast carcinoma, edematous skin is tethered to the breast by Cooper ligaments and mimics orange peel or peau d’orange. Microscopy shows: No inflammation is present. Diffuse lymphovascular space plugging with carcinoma cells in dermal lymphatics. The presentation can be confused with a breast infection, leading to delayed diagnosis. The stage of Inflammatory Breast Cancer (IBC) is always T4d, which corresponds to at least stage III breast cancer. This indicates locally advanced disease with a poor prognosis, though it may be stage IV if distant metastases are present. Giant fibroadenoma (Option B) is a benign breast tumour that can grow large but is usually firm and mobile . It is not associated with warmth in the breast and is unlikely to cause signs of inflammation, as seen in inflammatory carcinoma. Phyllodes tumours (Option C), also called cystosarcoma phyllodes are stromal tumours developing from the connective tissue of the breast. Most of them are benign, but a small number can be borderline or malignant. They do not generally cause the redness and skin changes seen in inflammatory breast cancer. Galactocele (Option D) is a benign lump, which is a milk retention cyst, and it usually occurs in lactating women. It presents as a moderately firm, painless mass that may gradually or rapidly enlarge, with size fluctuations throughout the day. While they are generally painless and non-inflammatory, complications can occasionally lead to infection.",

      "explanation": "Correct Answer: A) Addisonian crisis Explanation: The most likely cause of the patient's lethargy , fatigue , and hypotension (with no sign of bleeding) is an Addisonian crisis (also known as an adrenal crisis ) due to adrenal insufficiency after bilateral adrenalectomy . It occurs when there is a sudden, severe deficiency of cortisol and aldosterone . It leads to hypotension , electrolyte imbalances , and symptoms like lethargy and fatigue . It is managed by IV hydrocortisone. SIADH (Option B) results in hyponatremia due to excessive ADH secretion, but it does not explain the low blood pressure and fatigue in this patient, as the Addisonian crisis does. Diabetes insipidus (Option C) involves a deficiency of ADH or kidney resistance to it, leading to excessive urination and thirst . It would not typically present with the hypotension and lethargy seen in this patient. Cerebral salt wasting disease (Option D) can potentially cause increased urinary loss of sodium, hyponatremia and hypovolemia due to CNS conditions, while adrenal crisis shows low sodium alongside other symptoms related to low cortisol and aldosterone levels, requiring immediate hormone replacement therapy.

      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: B) Nucleotide scan Explanation: The best method to localise extra-adrenal pheochromocytomas is through a Nucleotide scan (such as MIBG or PET scan), which allows for accurate identification of the tumour's location. MIBG is a radiopharmaceutical that is selectively absorbed by neuroendocrine tumours, such as pheochromocytomas. When radioactive iodine-labelled MIBG is administered intravenously, the tumour cells take it up due to their affinity for norepinephrine. Once the MIBG is taken up by the tumour, a whole-body scan is performed using a gamma camera , allowing for the precise localization of pheochromocytomas, including extra-adrenal tumours . X-ray (Option A) is not suitable for visualising soft tissue tumours like pheochromocytomas or detecting abnormal growths. It is better suited for visualising bones or detecting larger, more obvious structural abnormalities. VMA excretion (Option C) is a metabolite of catecholamines and can be measured in urine to help diagnose pheochromocytoma . However, while increased VMA (Vanillyl mandelic acid) excretion is suggestive of pheochromocytoma, it does not help localise the tumor . Clinical examination (Option D) can reveal signs and symptoms of pheochromocytoma, but it is not reliable for localising an extra-adrenal pheochromocytoma. Symptoms like hypertension, sweating, and tachycardia suggest the presence of pheochromocytoma, but further imaging studies (like the nucleotide scan) are required for accurate localisation.

      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: B) Acute pancreatitis Explanation: Grey-Turner's sign refers to bluish discolouration or bruising of the flanks (the sides of the abdomen), which can be seen in severe acute pancreatitis . It is a sign of retroperitoneal hemorrhage , which occurs when pancreatic inflammation spreads from the anterior pararenal space to the lateral edge of the quadratus lumborum muscle, causing bruising on the flanks. Acute appendicitis (Option A) generally presents with right lower abdominal pain, fever, and nausea. It does not usually cause retroperitoneal haemorrhage or bruising, so Grey-Turner's sign is not associated with it. Acute cholecystitis (Option C) involves inflammation of the gallbladder, usually causing right upper quadrant pain. While it may cause jaundice or tenderness, Grey-Turner's sign is not typically seen. Acute hepatitis (Option D) involves liver inflammation, often caused by viral infections or drug-induced liver injury, which can cause jaundice, but Grey-Turner's sign is not characteristic of hepatitis.

      },
      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: C) Radioiodine scan Explanation: After thyroidectomy for papillary thyroid cancer, a radioiodine scan (I-131) is recommended to detect any remaining thyroid tissue or metastasis, as papillary thyroid cancer is often Radioactive Iodine (RAI) -avid (capable of absorbing and concentrating radioactive iodine). Roles: Remnant Ablation: Destruction of any remaining benign thyroid tissue following a total or subtotal thyroidectomy. Adjuvant Therapy: Additional treatment post-surgery to reduce the risk of cancer recurrence. Treatment of Known Disease: Targeting and destroying residual cancer cells or recurrent structural or biochemical disease. Radioactive Iodine Ablation (RAI): Isotope Used : Iodine-131 (Half-Life: 8 Days) Emission: Beta Rays : 90% of emissions; targeted treatment of the thyroid gland while sparing surrounding tissues. Gamma Rays: 10% of emissions; used for imaging and also responsible for side effects. Applications: Primarily for Differentiated Thyroid Cancer (DTC) like Papillary Thyroid Carcinoma (PTC) and Follicular Thyroid Carcinoma (FTC). Side Effects : (Dose-Dependent): Sialadenitis, nasolacrimal duct obstruction, transient swelling, infertility, secondary malignancies (e.g., leukemia) Indications Contraindications Differentiated thyroid cancers E.g., Papillary thyroid carcinoma Follicular thyroid carcinoma Hurthle cell carcinoma Tumor size >2cm One or more risk factors Obvious extrathyroidal extension >45 years of age Lymph node and distant metastasis Poorly differentiated thyroid cancers E.g., Medullary thyroid carcinoma Anaplastic thyroid carcinoma Pregnancy & Breastfeeding (Absolute contraindications) Vomiting & Diarrhea (Relative contraindications) Radiotherapy (Option A) is not the standard follow-up after thyroidectomy for papillary thyroid cancer (PTC). RAI therapy is preferred as it targets thyroid tissue, while radiotherapy is reserved for advanced cases or metastasis. RAI is more effective than radiotherapy for treating remaining thyroid cells or metastasis. Chemotherapy (Option B): Papillary thyroid cancer (PTC) is not treated with chemotherapy, as it doesn't respond well. RAI is the standard treatment, while chemotherapy is used for more aggressive cancers like anaplastic thyroid cancer. Wait and watch (Option D) approach may be used in low-risk cases of papillary thyroid cancer (PTC) if the tumor is small, localized, and has been fully removed. However, after thyroidectomy, a radioiodine scan (RAI) is typically done to check for remaining tissue or metastases, even in low-risk cases.

Bilateral complete injury to the RLN is the most lethal nerve injury during thyroid surgery as it can cause paralysis of both vocal cords , leading to stridor, voice changes, breathing difficulties, and, in severe cases, airway obstruction. Unilateral injury is generally less dangerous than bilateral injury because the contralateral vocal cord can compensate to a significant degree.

In some cases, surgery may be considered after effective systemic treatment has been achieved, depending on the response to chemotherapy and the overall treatment plan. Incorrect Options: Option A - Simple mastectomy : This procedure involves the removal of the entire breast but does not address regional lymph nodes or distant metastases.

It presents as midline swelling that moves with deglutition and protrusion of the tongue. Most Common Site: Subhyoid (can also be seen on the floor of the mouth, Suprahyoid, near thyroid cartilage and foramen caecum) Treatment: Sistrunk Procedure : Complete surgical excision of the cyst and its tract up to the base of the tongue, as well as a portion of the hyoid bone, to prevent recurrence. Incision and drainage (Option C) are never done as they lead to the formation of a Thyroglossal fistula. (It also forms if an inflamed cyst ruptures.)—Always Acquired.

      "explanation": "Correct Answer: D) Angiography of renal arteries Explanation: The patient’s symptoms, including polyuria , polydipsia , lethargy , abdominal pain , and a history of recurrent kidney stones , strongly suggest a diagnosis of primary hyperparathyroidism , which can result in hypercalcemia . The most likely cause of primary hyperparathyroidism is a parathyroid adenoma. Angiography of renal arteries is typically used to evaluate the renal vasculature in cases of renal artery stenosis or other vascular abnormalities. However, it does not provide useful information for diagnosing primary hyperparathyroidism, which is the most likely diagnosis in this patient. Incorrect Options: Nuclear sestamibi scan (Option A) is used to identify parathyroid adenomas . It is a key investigation in the diagnosis of primary hyperparathyroidism , especially in localising the adenoma. USG neck (Option B) can also help in visualising parathyroid glands and is commonly used for parathyroid adenomas . Dual energy radiographic absorptiometry (DEXA) (Option C) is a test used to assess bone density and is often ordered to evaluate for osteoporosis , which is common in primary hyperparathyroidism due to bone resorption from elevated calcium.

      "explanation": "Correct Answer: B) Surgical resection Explanation: The preferred treatment for a benign tumour of the superficial parathyroid gland is surgical resection, which involves removing the tumour to avoid complications. Since benign parathyroid tumours (often referred to as adenomas) can lead to conditions like hypercalcemia, surgery is usually the most effective and curative treatment. The main modality of treatment is as follows: Indications of parathyroidectomy: Severe symptoms Young age Markedly reduced bone density Serum calcium more than 11mg% Urinary calculi Neuromuscular symptoms Urinary calcium more than 400mg/24 hours Indications of surgery in an asymptomatic case are: Serum calcium 0.25 mmol/L (1.0 mg/dL) above the upper limit of normal Bone mineral density (BMD) by DEXA; T score –2.5 at lumbar spine, total hip, femoral neck, or distal one-third of radius Vertebral fracture Creatinine clearance <60 mL/min 24-hour urinary calcium >10 mmol/dL (>400 mg/day) or increased risk of stone formation by risk analysis Age <50 years When medical therapy is not possible Miami Protocol: An intraoperative PTH is measured If it has reduced by more than 50% than the preoperative value, it indicates surgical removal. Casanova test: It is to differentiate the recurrence site after Removal of all 4 Parathyroid gland and auto transplant of it. PTH measurements are taken from the neck vein & brachial vessel. A positive Casanova test is if 20 times higher concentration in the brachial vessel Contraindications of surgery: Absolute contraindication: familial hypercalciuric hypercalcemia Here, elevated calcium and PTH level but 24 hr urinary calcium and calcium to creatinine clearance are low. Parathyroidectomy does not cure hypercalcemia due to FHH syndrome. Relative contraindications: Controlateral recurrent laryngeal nerve injury. Vocal cord dysfunction.",

      "correct_answer": "D",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: D) Crack in the nipple Explanation: The most likely cause of Acute Mastitis is crack in the nipple. It refers to infammation of the breast tissue. It can occur in lactating (more common) as well as non-lactating women. It occurs during the first month of breastfeeding. It is caused by a local infection (due to cracks and fissures in the nipples). Organisms: Staphylococcus aureus (more common), Streptococci Clinical features: Erythematous and painful breast Fever Single or multiple abscesses ( Staphylococci ) Cellulitis ( Streptococci ) Management: Antibiotics Continued milk expression from the breast. Breast engorgement (Option A) causes swelling and discomfort but doesn’t lead to infection or mastitis unless complications like blocked ducts or nipple damage occur. It also lacks the fever and redness seen in mastitis. Hormonal influence (Option B) , such as those during pregnancy or menstruation, can cause breast tenderness and swelling, but they don't directly lead to acute mastitis. While hormonal fluctuations may contribute to conditions like engorgement, they don't cause the infection or inflammation seen in mastitis. Absence of lactation (Option C) , or insufficient milk supply, may cause discomfort or engorgement but is not linked to acute mastitis. Mastitis usually occurs in breastfeeding women due to milk stasis, blocked ducts, or nipple trauma, which allow bacteria to enter. If a mother isn't lactating, mastitis is unlikely unless there's an unrelated infection. Reference: Bailey & Love's Short Practice of Surgery, 28th Edition, Page 927.

      "explanation": "Correct Answer: C) ER positive Explanation: A BIRADS-5 lesion is highly suspicious for malignancy, and the prognostic factors depend on tumour biology. ER, (Estrogen Receptor) positivity is associated with a better prognosis as it indicates that the tumor is likely to respond to hormonal therapy. Disease factors that influence prognosis Histologic Subtypes Invasive Ductal Carcinoma (IDC): Prognosis varies by grade and molecular markers. Invasive Lobular Carcinoma (ILC): Intermediate prognosis. Tubular and Mucinous Carcinomas: Best prognosis. Basal-like Breast Cancer: Aggressive, triple-negative, no targeted treatments. Other Subtypes: Medullary, cribriform, papillary, adenoid cystic, and metaplastic carcinomas vary in prognosis. Tumor Size & Lymph Node Pathologic staging (tumour size, lymph nodes) guides prognosis and treatment. Larger tumours and positive lymph nodes = worse prognosis. Molecular Markers Hormone Receptors (ER, PR) : ER-positive = better prognosis , responsive to endocrine therapy. HER-2 Status: HER-2 positive = aggressive but treatable with targeted therapies. Patient factors that influence prognosis Age Younger, particularly premenopausal women, may have higher local recurrence rates post-surgery, but radiation therapy can reduce this risk. BRCA Mutation (Option A) Generally more aggressive and associated with poorer prognosis. Family History A strong family history may indicate inherited susceptibility and potentially a worse prognosis. Prior Breast Cancer History Previous breast cancer can negatively influence the prognosis of a new diagnosis. Lifestyle Factors Obesity and inactivity are linked to increased recurrence risk and may affect overall prognosis. Treatment Adherence Non-compliance can worsen prognosis. p53 positive (Option B): Mutations in the p53 gene are commonly observed in various cancers, including breast cancer. p53 positivity generally indicates a more aggressive form of the disease, making it a poor prognostic factor. High Ki-67 (Option D): Ki-67 is a protein expressed in proliferating cells. A high Ki-67 index suggests a rapid rate of cell division, which is typically associated with more aggressive tumours and, therefore, a worse prognosis.

Management of Stage IV HER2-Positive Metastatic Breast Cancer Type Description Treatment Systemic Therapy Targeted Therapy: Specific for HER2-positive cancers Trastuzumab, Pertuzumab, Lapatinib Chemotherapy: Addresses systemic disease Taxanes, Anthracyclines, Capecitabine Hormonal Therapy: For hormone receptor-positive cases (not standalone for HER2-positive) Tamoxifen, Aromatase Inhibitors (if combined) Local Therapy Palliative Surgery: Relieves significant symptoms from primary tumour growth Mastectomy Radiotherapy: Controls localised symptoms, especially bone metastases _ Bone-targeted Therapy Manages bone metastases and reduces skeletal-related events Bisphosphonates, Denosumab Incorrect Options: Sorafenib (Option B) is a multikinase inhibitor that targets angiogenesis pathways involved in tumour growth. However, it lacks specificity for HER-2 positive breast cancer or trastuzumab resistance, making it ineffective for this condition. Vemurafenib (Option C) is primarily used in melanoma with a BRAF V600E mutation; this drug is not suitable for HER-2-positive breast cancer and is not indicated in this case. Erlotinib (Option D) : Although effective in non-small cell lung cancer with EGFR mutations, erlotinib’s activity in HER-2-positive breast cancer is limited, making it an inappropriate treatment choice for this patient.

CAH is often diagnosed through newborn screening programs, which aim to detect hormone imbalances shortly after birth. Genetic testing and hormone level assessments are also used for diagnosis. Incorrect Options: Option A - Cirrhosis: Cirrhosis is a late stage of scarring (fibrosis) of the liver caused by many forms of liver diseases and conditions, such as hepatitis and chronic alcoholism. It can lead to various structural changes in the liver, but these changes might not be directly visible on a single CT image. Option B - HCC (Hepatocellular Carcinoma): Hepatocellular carcinoma is the most common type of primary liver cancer. It often occurs in the context of chronic liver disease and cirrhosis. On a CT scan, HCC may appear as a mass or a lesion within the liver. The appearance can vary, but it might have characteristics like enhancing in the arterial phase and washout in the delayed phase on contrast-enhanced scans. Option D - Hepatitis: Hepatitis is an inflammation of the liver, often caused by viral infections. On a CT scan, the liver might appear enlarged and have altered density due to inflammation, but specific visual characteristics might not be definitive for a hepatitis diagnosis. Other diagnostic methods, such as blood tests and clinical history, are usually necessary Reference: .",

      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: B) Hydrocortisone Explanation: The patient likely has adrenal insufficiency due to the sudden discontinuation of corticosteroids, prescribed for rheumatoid arthritis. This can precipitate an adrenal crisis, presenting with hypotension, dizziness, hypoglycemia, and hyperkalemia. The treatment of choice for adrenal crisis is Hydrocortisone , which is a corticosteroid that replaces the deficient hormones and helps in stabilising the patient's condition. Addison's disease / primary adrenocortical failure: Clinical features Glucocorticoid insufficiency: Weight loss, anorexia, malaise, weakness, nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea or constipation, postural hypotension, shock, hypoglycemia, hyponatremia (dilutional), hypercalcemia Mineralocorticoid insufficiency Hypotension, shock, hyponatremia, hyperkalemia ACTH excess: Pigmentation Adrenal androgen insufficiency: Decreased body hair and loss of libido, especially in females Investigations Random plasma cortisol measurement (values >500 nmol/L exclude adrenal insufficiency) Short ACTH stimulation test- if random cortisol levels are between 100-500, 1 microgram ACTH, serum cortisol levels of <500 is considered confirmatory for adrenal insufficiency. Plasma renin and aldosterone (high renin with low/lower part of the reference range aldosterone in mineralocorticoid deficiency) Dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate (DHEAS) and androstenedione in women Adrenal autoantibodies for autoimmune causes; imaging (CT/MRI) if antibodies are negative. Management Glucocorticoid Replacement: Oral hydrocortisone is preferred, and Prednisolone and dexamethasone may also be used. Mineralocorticoid Replacement: Fludrocortisone Addisonian crisis An Addisonian crisis is a life-threatening medical emergency that occurs when there is a severe deficiency of cortisol and aldosterone. It is most commonly seen in people with Addison's disease (primary adrenal insufficiency), especially when their hormone replacement therapy is inadequate or missed or during periods of extreme stress (e.g., illness, trauma, or surgery).

        "D": "MRI"
      },
      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: A) SPECT Sestamibi Explanation: The best method to conclusively localise a parathyroid adenoma would be SPECT Sestamibi . SPECT Sestamibi : Sestamibi scintigraphy is a common and effective technique for parathyroid imaging. It works by utilising a radiotracer that is preferentially taken up by hyperfunctioning parathyroid glands. SPECT (Single Photon Emission Computed Tomography) is a more advanced form of imaging, offering three-dimensional (3D) imaging, which significantly improves the accuracy of localising parathyroid adenomas. Sensitivity : The sensitivity of sestamibi-SPECT is 79% for localising a parathyroid adenoma and provides more anatomical detail compared to other methods. While its sensitivity for multi-gland disease is lower (44%), it is still the best available method for localising single parathyroid adenomas. Tc99m sestamibi scan (Option B) refers to the standard two-phase imaging of parathyroid glands. While effective for identifying parathyroid adenomas, it lacks the 3D imaging capabilities of SPECT , thus making it slightly less accurate than SPECT Sestamibi in providing detailed localisation. Ultrasound (USG) (Option C) is commonly used for initial imaging and is non-invasive, inexpensive, and widely available. However, its sensitivity for localising multi-gland disease is only about 35%, and it has limitations in detecting ectopic parathyroid glands (e.g., in the mediastinum or retroesophageal locations). Therefore, while useful as an initial screening tool, it is not the best option for conclusive localisation of parathyroid adenomas. MRI (Option D) has a relatively low sensitivity (43%–94%) for parathyroid adenomas and is used only as a second or third-line modality. It is typically reserved for challenging or reoperative cases and is not the best method for the initial localisation of parathyroid adenomas.",

      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: B) Aspirin Explanation: Aspirin is not recommended in thyrotoxic crisis. It can interfere with the effectiveness of iodine therapy by displacing thyroid hormones from protein binding sites, potentially worsening the condition. Thyroid Storm About A thyroid storm, or thyrotoxic crisis, is an acute, life-threatening complication of hyperthyroidism. It presents with multisystem involvement and has a mortality rate of 8 to 25% despite advancements in treatment. Etiology Most commonly associated with Graves' disease but can also occur in toxic multinodular goitre and toxic thyroid adenoma. Precipitating Factors: Abrupt discontinuation of antithyroid medications. Thyroid surgery. Non-thyroid surgery. Acute illnesses (e.g., infections, diabetic ketoacidosis, myocardial infarction, stroke) act as stressors that can trigger excess thyroid hormone release. Parturition (childbirth). Recent use of iodinated contrast medium. Trauma or Burns or traumatic brain injury. Medication side effects (e.g., amiodarone, anaesthetics, salicylates). Raised beta-hcg conditions such as complete mole, twin pregnancies Clinical Features Fever: High temperature (104°F to 106°F) with diaphoresis. Cardiovascular Involvement: Tachycardia (>140 bpm), heart failure, arrhythmias, hypotension, and risk of cardiac arrest. CNS Manifestations: Agitation, delirium, anxiety, psychosis, or coma. Gastrointestinal Symptoms: Nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal pain, intestinal obstruction, and acute hepatic failure. Physical Exam Findings: Tachycardia, goitre, hand tremors, moist and warm skin, hyperreflexia, systolic hypertension, and jaundice. Management Initial Supportive Measures: IV fluids, oxygen, cooling blankets, and acetaminophen (Option A) . Beta-blocker Therapy: Start with propranolol (Option D) immediately (40-80 mg every 4-6 hours) to control adrenergic tone. Thionamide Therapy: Administer propylthiouracil (500-1000 mg loading, then 250 mg every 4 hours) or methimazole (20 mg every 4-6 hours). This reduces thyroid hormone synthesis. Iodine Solution (Option C): Give SSKI (5 drops every 6 hours) after thionamide to reduce the release of thyroid hormone Glucocorticoids: Hydrocortisone (100 mg IV every 8 hours) or dexamethasone (2 mg every 6 hours). Therapy to block peripheral conversion of T4 to T3 : Iodinated radiocontrast agent, glucocorticoid, PTU, propranolol Cholestyramine (Bile acid sequestrant) : 4 grams orally 4 times daily for severe cases to reduce enterohepatic recycling of thyroid hormone. Monitoring: Admit to ICU with close cardiac monitoring and ventilatory support if needed. Alternative Medications: Esmolol as a short-acting beta-blocker; diltiazem if beta-blockers are contraindicated. Surgery: Thyroidectomy for patients with contraindications to thionamides after pre-treatment. Definitive Treatment: Recommend radioiodine therapy or surgery for hyperthyroidism once stabilized.

The sentinel lymph node is the first lymph node in the lymphatic system that receives drainage from the tumor site, and it is the most likely node to contain metastatic cancer cells if they have spread. In breast cancer, the dye for SLNB is commonly injected in or around the areola. The areola is the pigmented area surrounding the nipple. By injecting the dye in this location, it can flow through the lymphatic channels and reach the sentinel lymph node(s) in the axilla (armpit). Incorrect Options: Option A - Axilla: Injecting the dye directly into the axilla is not the common practice for sentinel lymph node biopsy in breast cancer. While the axillary lymph nodes are the primary drainage site for the breast, the dye is typically injected near the areola to allow it to flow through the lymphatic channels and reach the sentinel lymph node(s) in the axilla. Option B - Tail of Spence: The tail of Spence is an extension of breast tissue into the axilla. However, the dye is not typically injected specifically into the tail of Spence. It is more common to inject the dye near the areola to ensure proper drainage to the sentinel lymph node(s). Option C - Nipple: Injecting the dye directly into the nipple is not the standard practice for sentinel lymph node biopsy.

Peau d'orange can be a significant sign of inflammatory breast cancer, which is an aggressive form of breast cancer. It is characterized by rapid changes in the breast, including redness, warmth, swelling, and the peau d'orange appearance. Therefore, it is considered a more conspicuous sign of breast cancer compared to nipple retraction or puckering. Incorrect Options: Option A - Nipple retraction: Nipple retraction refers to a change in the position or appearance of the nipple, causing it to turn inward or flatten. While nipple retraction can be a potential sign of breast cancer, it is not the most conspicuous sign. Other conditions, such as benign breast changes or infections, can also cause nipple retraction. Therefore, it is important to consider other symptoms and undergo further evaluation if nipple retraction is observed. Option C - Puckering: Puckering or dimpling of the breast refers to an area of skin that appears pulled inward or has an uneven texture. It can be caused by the presence of a tumor that tethers the underlying tissue, leading to changes in the skin's appearance. Puckering can be a sign of breast cancer, but it is not as noticeable or specific as peau d'orange in indicating the presence of breast cancer.

      "explanation": "neuroendocrine tumor arising from chromaffin cells of the adrenal medulla or sympathetic ganglia. It secretes catecholamines, including epinephrine, norepinephrine, and dopamine, leading to characteristic symptoms like hypertension, headaches, palpitations, and sweating. The diagnosis of pheochromocytoma involves biochemical testing to measure levels of catecholamines and their metabolites. Fractionated metanephrines, including metanephrine and normetanephrine, are the most sensitive and specific tests for diagnosing pheochromocytoma. Fractionated metanephrines are measured in a 24-hour urine collection to provide an accurate reflection of catecholamine production over time. Elevated levels of fractionated metanephrines indicate excess catecholamine secretion, supporting the diagnosis of pheochromocytoma. Incorrect Options: Option A - 24-hour urinary Vanillylmandelic acid: Vanillylmandelic acid (VMA) is a metabolite of epinephrine and norepinephrine. While elevated VMA levels can be seen in patients with pheochromocytoma, fractionated metanephrines are more sensitive and specific for diagnosis. VMA measurement was historically used but has been largely replaced by fractionated metanephrines due to their higher sensitivity and specificity. Option C - 24-hour Urinary Hydroxy indole acetic acid: Hydroxyindoleacetic acid (HIAA) is a metabolite of serotonin, not catecholamines. While serotonin-producing tumors can cause symptoms similar to pheochromocytoma, such as flushing and diarrhea, measuring HIAA is not the primary diagnostic test for pheochromocytoma. Option D - 24-hour Urinary Hydroxy tryptamine: Hydroxytryptamine, also known as serotonin, is not directly related to the pathophysiology of pheochromocytoma. Elevated levels of serotonin may be seen in certain carcinoid tumors, which can present with symptoms similar to pheochromocytoma, but this test is not specific for pheochromocytoma diagnosis.
