      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: C) Type III Explanation: In this scenario, the imaging findings indicate that the fistula involves up to two-thirds of the circumference of the CBD, consistent with Type III Mirizzi syndrome Mirizzi’s syndrome It is seen in 1% of all cholecystectomies where a gallstone impacts the gallbladder wall, leading to compression and pressure necrosis. This often results in adherence to the common hepatic duct (CHD) or common bile duct (CBD) wall and can occasionally lead to a cholecystocholedochal fistula. Pathophysiology: The gallstone usually impacts from the Hartmann's pouch, leading to compression of the CHD/CBD. Can also occur from the fundus of the gallbladder into the CBD. Clinical Presentation: Fever Abdominal pain Obstructive jaundice Upper abdominal tenderness on the right side Possible palpable soft, enlarged liver Csendes Classification : Mirizzi’s Type Features Image Type I Extrinsic compression of the CBD/CHD by a large impacted stone in Hartmann's pouch; IA- the presence of cystic duct IB- is obliterated cystic duct Type II The stone has eroded the CBD/CHD less than 1/3rd circumference of the CBD/CHD forming a fistula Type III Involving up to 2/3rd of the circumference of CBD/ CHD Type IV Cholecystocholedochal fistula (>2/3rd) involving the entire circumference of the CBD/CHD TypeV Cholecystocholedochal fistula with cholecystoenteric fistula without gallstone ileus (VA) or with gallstone ileus (VB) Investigations: Ultrasonography (USG): Initial imaging to assess gallbladder and ducts. CT Scan: Provides detailed imaging of the biliary system. Endoscopic Retrograde Cholangiopancreatography (ERCP)/Magnetic Resonance Cholangiopancreatography (MRCP): Essential for delineating duct anatomy and identifying the site of obstruction. HIDA Scan : Useful for functional assessment of the biliary system. Findings: Dilatation of the intrahepatic biliary system with a block at the common hepatic duct (CHD).",

      "explanation": "Correct Answer: B) Presence of gallstones Explanation: The presence of Gall stones increases the risk of malignancy Gallbladder Polyp: Gallbladder polyps are often discovered incidentally during abdominal imaging. While most are benign, such as cholesterol polyps, adenomyomas, inflammatory polyps, adenomas, or other types, there is a possibility of malignancy, with adenocarcinoma being the most common (80%), followed by squamous cell carcinoma and cystadenomas. Ultrasonography demonstrating a gallbladder polyp Cholesterol polyp Adenomatous polyp More common Small <10 mm Multiple Benign Pedunculated Less common Large >10mm Single Premalignant Sessile Factors that increase the risk of invasive cancer in adenomatous polyp: Age more than 60 years Presence of gallstone Size of polyp more than 1 cm Documented increase in size on repeated scans Treatment: Cholecystectomy is recommended for symptomatic patients or as a preventive measure to reduce the risk of cancer in individuals who have additional conditions like gallstones, primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC), biliary colic, or pancreatitis. Polyps in patients over 50, sessile polyps with wall thickening exceeding 4 mm, and those larger than 10 mm warrant surgical removal.

      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: C) Enterolithotomy Explanation: Given the clinical scenario and imaging findings, the patient is most likely suffering from gallstone ileus . The optimal initial surgical management involves Enterolithotomy which addresses the intestinal obstruction caused by the impacted gallstone Effects and Complications of Gallstones: Gallbladder Common bile duct and pancreas Small intestine Acute cholecystitis Chronic cholecystitis Mucocele Empyema Gangrene Perforation Carcinoma gallbladder CBD stones Biliary obstruction (Jaundice) Acute pancreatitis Mirizzi syndrome Gallstone ileus leading to intestinal obstruction Gallstone Ileus A rare complication of cholelithiasis (0.4%) caused by the impaction of one or more gallstones within the gastrointestinal tract, is more common in the elderly and women. Pathophysiology: Acute cholecystitis → erosion of inflamed tissues → Formation of a cholecystointestinal fistula → Gallstone ileus Small gallstones typically pass through the intestines, but stones 2–5 cm in size can become impacted, usually in the terminal ileum or at the ileocecal valve. Clinical Manifestations: Acute, intermittent, or chronic episodes of partial or complete gastrointestinal obstruction. Signs of obstruction include dehydration, abdominal distension and tenderness, high-pitched bowel sounds, and obstructive jaundice. Diagnosis: Plain Abdominal Radiograph: Partial or complete intestinal obstruction Pneumobilia or contrast material in the biliary tree Calcified gallstone with position changes on serial films (tumbling sign) CT Scan: Superior sensitivity (up to 93%) Shows abnormal gallbladder with air, air-fluid level, or fluid accumulation with an irregular wall Management: Management of intestinal obstruction Enterolithotomy: The most common surgical procedure A longitudinal incision on the antimesenteric border proximal to the site of impaction Gallstone is brought to a non-edematous bowel segment by gentle manipulation and extraction. Cholecystoenteric fistula resection only if the patient is stable and there are residual gallstones that may cause infection or recurrent ileus Cholecystectomy and fistula repair (Option A): While important, this is not the initial step due to the patient's unstable condition and intestinal obstruction. Endoscopic removal of the gallstone (Option B): Not feasible for this condition due to the intestinal obstruction.

      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: C) Porcelain gallbladder Explanation: The findings of extensive calcification of the gallbladder wall, along with the bluish appearance and brittle consistency, are characteristic features of a porcelain gallbladder. Porcelain Gallbladder Definition: Also known as calcified gallbladder, characterized by extensive calcium encrustation in the gallbladder wall. Characteristics: Surgical Appearance: Bluish appearance of the gallbladder. Brittle consistency of the gallbladder wall. Clinical Features: Most patients are asymptomatic. Commonly seen in the 5th to 6th decades of life. 95% of patients have gallstones. Typically diagnosed incidentally on X-ray or CT scan. There is a 6% increased risk of malignancy. Diagnosis: Incidental findings on abdominal X-ray or CT Treatment: Early laparoscopic cholecystectomy is recommended due to the increased risk of malignancy. Gallbladder carcinoma (Option A): While there is an increased risk of malignancy associated with porcelain gallbladder, the symptoms and imaging findings in this scenario point more directly to porcelain gallbladder rather than cancer itself, especially given that the patient is asymptomatic. Cholesterolosis (Option B): This condition is characterized by lipid accumulation in the gallbladder mucosa and does not present with calcification of the gallbladder wall. Acute cholecystitis (Option D): This would typically present with acute pain, fever, and signs of inflammation, which are not described in this scenario.",

        "D": "Portal vein"
      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: B) Cystic lymph node Explanation: The cystic lymph node, or Lund’s node , is located within Calot's triangle. It serves as an important landmark for identifying the cystic artery. Inflammation or anatomical variations can obscure typical landmarks, making the cystic lymph node a valuable reference point during surgery. Calot's triangle, also known as the cystohepatic triangle, is an important anatomical area during gallbladder surgery. The boundaries of Calot's triangle are defined by: Cystic duct (lateral boundary) Common hepatic duct (medial boundary) The inferior surface of the liver (superior boundary) The contents of Calot's triangle typically include the cystic artery, which supplies blood to the gallbladder, and the cystic lymph node (Lund’s node). Identification of these structures is crucial during a cholecystectomy to avoid accidental injury to the biliary or vascular systems. Note: The term \"hepatocystic triangle\" is often used interchangeably with Calot's triangle. It emphasizes the inclusion of the liver's inferior surface as part of the boundaries, along with the cystic duct and the common hepatic duct. Gallbladder fundus (Option A): The fundus of the gallbladder is the uppermost part and does not provide a useful landmark for locating the cystic artery during dissection within Calot's triangle. Common bile duct (Option C): The common bile duct lies outside the typical boundaries of Calot's triangle; the correct duct involved is the common hepatic duct. Portal vein (Option D): The portal vein is located posterior to the hepatoduodenal ligament and is not within Calot's triangle. It does not serve as a landmark for identifying the cystic artery.",

It results from adhesions forming between the cystic duct and the neck of the gallbladder. CD - Cystic duct HP - Hartmann’s pouch Gb - Gall Bladder Phrygian cap (Option A): is a benign congenital anatomical variant of the gallbladder, characterized by a fold at the fundus that creates a cap-like appearance. It does not involve the presence of gallstones.

        "D": "Laparoscopic examination for staging"
      },
      "correct_answer": "D",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: D) Laparoscopic examination for staging Explanation: Given the patient's symptoms, physical findings, and elevated tumour markers, gallbladder cancer is highly suspected. Although imaging studies have been done, accurate staging is crucial before deciding on a definitive treatment. A laparoscopic examination will help to detect any peritoneal or liver metastases that could preclude surgical resection, thereby guiding the appropriate management plan. Symptoms and Presentation: Often indistinguishable from benign gallbladder diseases Symptoms include: Biliary colic Cholecystitis (especially in older individuals) Jaundice (late-stage) Loss of appetite (late-stage) Palpable mass (late-stage) Laboratory Findings: Non-specific indicators: Anemia Leukocytosis Slight increase in transaminases Tumor markers: Elevated CA19-9 Elevated carcinoembryonic antigen (in ~80% of patients) Diagnostic Imaging: Ultrasonography (USG): Initial diagnosis CT Scans: Thorax, abdomen, and pelvis for confirmation and staging MRI/MRCP: For accurate preoperative staging PET Scans: To identify metastatic disease Staging and Biopsy: Preoperative Staging: Crucial to assess local disease extent and rule out distant metastases Percutaneous Biopsy: Guided by radiological imaging for unresectable tumours Laparoscopic Examination: Detects peritoneal or liver metastases that preclude surgery Immediate laparoscopic cholecystectomy (Option A): This is generally considered if the diagnosis is benign or if it's a straightforward case of symptomatic gallbladder disease. Given the suspicion of malignancy (indicated by elevated tumour markers and imaging findings), it is crucial to staging the disease before proceeding with surgical intervention. Percutaneous biopsy of the gallbladder mass (Option B): While this could be useful, gallbladder cancers are often difficult to biopsy percutaneously, and the risk of seeding the tumor or causing complications is a concern. Referral for palliative chemotherapy (Option C): This should only be considered if there is confirmed advanced or metastatic cancer. In this case, there is no evidence of distant metastases from the CT scan. Reference: Bailey & Love’s Short Practice of Surgery, Ed 28, Pg. 1258",

      "explanation": "nodes Correct Answer: B) Radical en bloc resection of the gallbladder, liver wedge, and regional lymph nodes Explanation: For a patient with gallbladder cancer of T3 N0 M0 staging, radical en bloc resection is the most appropriate treatment approach. This involves the surgical removal of the gallbladder, the invaded portion of the liver, and potentially affected regional lymph nodes. This approach aims to achieve clear margins and effectively treat the localized disease, offering the best chance for a cure in the absence of distant metastasis. Staging Aims to: Assess local disease . Detects metastatic disease in the liver, peritoneum, lymphatics, or locations outside the abdomen. Imaging Techniques: Ultrasonography (USG) Computed Tomography (CT) Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) / Magnetic Resonance Cholangiopancreatography (MRCP) Laparoscopic examination Positron Emission Tomography (PET) scanning Treatment Based on Stage: If Gallbladder cancer is found incidentally on resection of gallbladder for gallstones, then: If, early disease: For disease confined to the mucosa , if negative cystic duct margin and no recurrence on imaging- No further treatment For transmural disease- Radical en bloc resection of gallbladder fossa, liver wedge, and regional lymph nodes. If, advanced Cancer: Non-operative palliative care. Endoscopic/percutaneous methods to relieve obstructive jaundice. Adenocarcinoma: Early-stage limited to mucosa: No additional treatment is required if imaging shows no recurrence. Beyond mucosa: Extensive surgery involving gallbladder fossa, a portion of the liver, and nearby lymph nodes. Endoscopic stenting to relieve jaundice (Option A): Given the cancer's local invasion into the liver, endoscopic stenting alone does not provide a treatment for the cancer itself. Palliative chemotherapy (Option C): Typically used for cancers that are not amenable to surgical resection or have spread beyond the local area (distant metastasis). No further treatment if the tumour is confined to the mucosa (Option D) : Since local invasion into the liver is present, a more aggressive treatment approach is required.",

      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: B) Moynihan Hump Explanation: Moynihan's hump , also known as the ' caterpillar turn ,' describes a very tortuous common or right hepatic artery in front of the cystic duct's origin. The right hepatic artery can be especially tortuous and may lie close to the gallbladder and cystic duct. This tortuosity often results in a short cystic artery, increasing the risk of arterial injury during cholecystectomy. The common hepatic artery can also exhibit a tortuous configuration, contributing to similar risks. It is the most dangerous anomaly to be encountered during laparoscopic cholecystectomy as it can lead to heavy bleeding due to injury to the arteries. Phrygian cap (Option A) is a congenital variant of the gallbladder characterized by a fold at the fundus that resembles a cap. It is a benign condition and is typically asymptomatic, with its appearance being consistent with a cap-like structure on ultrasound. It has no clinical significance and does not affect gallbladder function. Floating gallbladder (Option C) refers to an abnormal positioning of the gallbladder within the abdominal cavity, often due to a lack of supporting attachments. This condition does not present as a cap-like fold on ultrasound. Mirizzi syndrome (Option D) occurs when a gallstone migrates from the gallbladder and obstructs or compresses the common bile duct, often due to a stone in the lower end of the cystic duct ulcerating into the common bile duct.",

Percutaneous cholecystostomy is the most appropriate management for a critically ill, unstable patient with acalculous cholecystitis, as it provides effective drainage and infection control with minimal risk. Investigation of Choice for Acalculous Cholecystitis Ultrasonography Preferred diagnostic test Can be performed bedside in the ICU Detects distended gallbladder, thickened wall, biliary sludge, pericholecystic fluid, and abscess formation CT Scan Aids in diagnosis Provides comprehensive abdominal and chest evaluation to rule out other infection sources HIDA Scan Useful if showing non-visualization of the gallbladder Less sensitive with higher false-positive rates in prolonged fasting, total parenteral nutrition, or liver disease patients Treatment: Initial Management: Early broad-spectrum antibiotics Fluid resuscitation Definitive Treatment: Laparoscopic Cholecystectomy: Most definitive treatment Safe even with severe acute inflammation if the patient is stable for surgery For Critically Ill, Unfit for Surgery Patients: Percutaneous Cholecystostomy : Preferred treatment Approximately 90% improvement rate with a cholecystostomy tube Interval Cholecystectomy : Can be considered after recovery, but not mandatory in the absence of gallstones or other gallbladder pathology Laparoscopic cholecystectomy (Option A): Although this is the definitive treatment for cholecystitis, it is often too risky for critically ill, unstable patients due to the invasive nature of the procedure and the need for general anaesthesia. Oral antibiotics and observation (Option B): This approach is insufficient for acalculous cholecystitis, which typically requires more aggressive intervention to manage the infection and decompress the gallbladder. Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) (Option C): While ERCP can be useful for managing bile duct stones and obstructions, it is not the standard treatment for acalculous cholecystitis, which involves inflammation of the gallbladder without gallstones.

      "explanation": "Correct Answer: C) Asymptomatic small gallbladder polyps Explanation: Small asymptomatic gallbladder polyps are generally not an indication for prophylactic cholecystectomy unless they are larger than 1 cm or have other risk factors for malignancy. Prophylactic Cholecystectomy: Prophylactic cholecystectomy involves the removal of the gallbladder in patients with gallstones who are asymptomatic. This procedure is considered when the potential risk of gallstone-related complications outweighs the surgical risks. Specific situations warranting prophylactic cholecystectomy include: Large Gallstones : Stones >3 cm have a higher likelihood of causing complications. (Option A ruled out) Choledocholithiasis : Gallstones in the common bile duct increase the risk of cholangitis and pancreatitis. (Option B ruled out) Chronic Haemolytic Conditions : Conditions like sickle cell disease and hereditary spherocytosis lead to pigment stone formation. Gallbladder Polyps : Polyps >1 cm may become malignant, justifying prophylactic surgery. Suspicion of Malignancy : Anomalous pancreatic ductal drainage may raise concern for cancer. Porcelain Gallbladder : Calcified gallbladder walls are linked to a higher cancer risk. High-Risk Ethnic Groups : Certain groups, such as Native Americans and people from northern India, have a higher incidence of gallbladder cancer associated with gallstones. Transplant Patients : Prophylactic removal during transplantation can prevent future complications. Bariatric Surgery : Concurrent gallbladder removal during bariatric surgery can reduce future risks.

      "explanation": "Correct Answer: C) Cholesterol stones that are typically radiolucent Explanation: Dissolution therapy is indicated for cholesterol stones, which are usually radiolucent, in patients with a functioning gallbladder and stones smaller than 1 cm. Dissolution Therapy for Gallstones: Mechanism: Bile Acids: Medications like chenodeoxycholic acid (CDCA) and ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA) dissolve cholesterol gallstones by inhibiting cholesterol absorption from the gut and reducing cholesterol synthesis in the liver. HMG-CoA Reductase Inhibition: These medications inhibit HMG-CoA reductase, a key enzyme in cholesterol production, and UDCA also hinders cholesterol absorption in the gastrointestinal tract.

      "explanation": "Correct Answer: D) Mercedes-Benz sign Explanation: The \"Mercedes Benz sign\" and \"seagull sign\" are terms used to describe the appearance of specific types of radiopaque gallstones on plain radiographs and CT scans which have a radiolucent triradiate (Mercedes Benz sign) or biradiate (seagull sign) fissure in the centre containing nitrogen gas resembling the Mercedes-Benz logo. MERCEDES-BENZ SIGN Murphy sign (Option A) is a clinical finding elicited during a physical exam that indicates gallbladder inflammation and acute cholecystitis While palpating the right upper quadrant, the examiner observes if the patient stops breathing voluntarily when the examiner exerts pressure under the right costal margin. Mermaid sign (Option B) and Stellate scar sign (Option C) are not established radiological terms related to gallstones and can be seen in conditions like ‘fetal abnormalities’ and ‘renal cell carcinoma’ respectively.",

      "explanation": "Correct Answer: B) Black pigment stones are associated with hemolysis. Explanation: Black pigment stones are associated with conditions causing hemolysis such as hereditary spherocytosis, and sickle cell disease, and are mainly composed of insoluble bilirubin pigment polymers. Feature Black Pigment Stones Brown Pigment Stones Composition Insoluble bilirubin pigment polymer, calcium phosphate, calcium bicarbonate Calcium bilirubinate, calcium palmitate, calcium stearate, cholesterol (Option D) Location Gallbladder Bile ducts Associated Conditions Hemolysis (hereditary spherocytosis, sickle cell disease), cirrhosis Bile stasis, infection, foreign bodies or parasites in the bile duct (Clonorchis sinensis, Ascaris lumbricoides) Pathophysiology Excess bilirubin from hemolysis precipitates in the gallbladder (Option C) Bacterial β -glucuronidase deconjugates bilirubin in the bile duct; unconjugated bilirubin precipitates (Option A) Image",

She has a history of Sickle cell disease and has been on total parenteral nutrition (TPN) for the past six months due to severe Crohn's disease post-ileal resection. She also gives a h/o OCP usage for 5 years. The patient underwent cholecystectomy which showed the following finding. Which of the following factors is least likely to contribute to the formation of this patient's condition?",

      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: B) Sickle cell disease Explanation: The image shows cholesterol gallstones. They are the most common type of gallstone in Europe and the U.S., accounting for 80% of cases. They form when cholesterol precipitates out of bile and combines with calcium salts, bile acids, bile pigments, and phospholipids. Cholesterol makes up between 50% and 99% of these gallstones. Sickle cell disease is not associated with cholesterol Gallstones but rather with black pigment stones because these stones occur in hemolytic states. Cholesterol Gallstones Formation Mechanism Cholesterol precipitates out into crystals when the concentration exceeds the solubility Contributing Factors Obesity High-calorie diet Oral contraceptives (Option D ruled out) Ileal disease/resection (Option C ruled out) Abnormal gallbladder emptying Supersaturation of Bile High cholesterol and lipid concentrations in bile secreted from the liver The concentration of bile in the Gallbladder Bile is concentrated through the absorption of water and sodium, increasing solutes and calcium Crystal Nucleation",
