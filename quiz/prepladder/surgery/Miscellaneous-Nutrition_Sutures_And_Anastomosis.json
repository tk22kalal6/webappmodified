      "question": "A 45 y/o male patient is admitted to the ICU following a major road traffic accident, resulting in multiple fractures and abdominal injuries. The patient is currently unable to take oral nutrition. He is expected to require enteral feeding for more than 3 weeks. Imaging studies reveal delayed gastric emptying and significant gastric distension. What is the most appropriate route for enteral nutrition in this patient?",

      },
      "correct_answer": "D",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: D) Feeding jejunostomy Explanation: This trauma patient has delayed gastric emptying with significant gastric distension and requires long-term enteral nutrition for more than 3 weeks . Therefore, feeding jejunostomy is the most appropriate route as it bypasses the stomach, thereby reducing the risk of complications such as aspiration and further gastric distension. Types of Artificial nutritional supports: Nasogastric tube (Option A) & ryles tube (Option B): Indicated when the duration of the feeding requirement is less than 3 weeks and the patient having good gastric emptying. Feeding gastrostomy (Option C): Indicated when the duration of the feeding requirement is more than 3 weeks and the patient having good gastric emptying.",

      "correct_answer": "D",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: D) Hypernatremia Explanation: In this scenario, the likely diagnosis is refeeding Syndrome , which can cause shifts in electrolytes as the body transitions from a catabolic to an anabolic state. Hence, hypernatremia is not commonly associated with refeeding syndrome. Refeeding syndrome: One of the most significant metabolic complications of both parenteral and enteral feeding. This occurs in the first days after feeding is commenced in patients who have been severely malnourished. The patient is considered to be at risk of developing refeeding syndrome with EITHER One or more of the following: (OR) Two or more of the following: BMI <16 kg/m 2 BMI <18.5 kg/m 2 Unintentional weight loss >15% within the last 3-6 months Unintentional weight loss >10% within the last 3-6 months. Little or no nutritional intake for more than 10 days Little or no nutritional intake for more than 5 days. Low potassium, phosphate or magnesium levels prior to feeding History of alcohol abuse or on medication, including insulin, chemotherapy, antacids or diuretics. Mechanism of Refeeding Syndrome: Electrolyte abnormalities: Hypophosphatemia, (Option A ruled out) Hypomagnesemia, (Option C ruled out) Hypokalemia, (Option B ruled out) Hypocalcemia Lead to arrhythmia, confusion, and respiratory failure, ultimately leading to death. Management: Matching the intake with requirements. Avoid overfeeding Calorie delivery should be increased slowly Vitamin administration (Thiamine): Given before feeding.

      "explanation": "\"spring coil\" effect. Correct Answer: B) Continuous suturing with bites 1 cm apart, avoiding suture locking to create a \"spring coil\" effect. Explanation: Jenkins's rule involves continuous suturing with bites that are 1 cm apart and no more than 1 cm from the previous bite, without locking the sutures to allow for a \"spring coil\" effect that manages wound tension during healing. Jenkins's Rule in Abdominal Wound Closure: Purpose : Optimizes healing and manages wound distension post-midline laparotomies.

      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: B) Aberdeen knot Explanation: Aberdeen knot is specifically used to secure the final stitch in continuous suture techniques. Continuous sutures involve using a single length of suture material to create multiple stitches, and the Aberdeen knot is effective at securing the end of this continuous line of sutures. It provides a secure closure and is particularly useful for finishing a continuous suture , ensuring the stitches remain tight and secure. Common Characteristics of Surgical Knots: Firmly tied : Prevents slippage. Small size : Minimizes foreign material in the body. Preserves circulation : Avoids cutting off blood flow to tissues. Undamaged materials : Ensure suture materials aren’t harmed while tying. Knotting techniques: Granny/ Slip Knots : A knot used to fasten a rope or line around an object, often deemed less dependable than the reef knot. Square/ Reef knot : It is a standard knot with an extra throw for security. (Option A ruled out) Surgeon’s Knot : Extra security, prevents slippage (two-throw knot). (Option C ruled out) Aberdeen Knot : Secures final knot in continuous sutures. (Option B) Buried Knot : Used to secure the ends of absorbable sutures when a subcuticular suture technique is used to close the skin. (Option D ruled out) Monofilament Sutures : Require six throws for secure tying; leave 1–2 mm ends to prevent unraveling. Types of Suture Techniques and Knots Suture Technique Description Knot Used Interrupted Sutures Individual stitches, each tied off separately. Tied like standard knots. Continuous Sutures Single length of suture for multiple stitches. Aberdeen knot at the end. (Option B) Mattress Sutures Used to evert or invert wound edges. Tied like interrupted sutures.

      "explanation": "mucosa. Correct Answer: B) It uses a continuous suture line through all layers of the bowel wall, except the mucosa. Explanation: The single-layer hand-sewn anastomosis involves using a continuous suture line that spans through all layers of the bowel wall except the mucosa . This technique is chosen for its simplicity and potentially lower risk of leakage due to fewer suture lines. Hand-Sewn Anastomosis Technique Description Material Used Advantages and Risks Single layer Anastomosis Continuous suture line, all layers except mucosa (Option B) (Option A & C ruled out) Monofilament absorbable Or Vicryl. Quicker procedure Potentially lower risk of leakage Double Layer Anastomosis Inner continuous layer (Albert layer) + outer interrupted sutures (Lembert layer) Inner layer: Vicryl Outer layer: Silk Traditional method with additional support from the outer layer. Risk: Potential for stricture formation. Stapled Anastomosis: Techniques: Method 1: The proximal bowel is opened, and an anvil stem is deployed through the side of the bowel. The bowel is then stapled shut. Method 2: A purse-string suture is placed on the distal stump. The anvil is tied to this suture, and the trocar and anvil are mated through the proximal bowel. (Option D ruled out) Optimal Side Limb Length: 3-6 cm",
