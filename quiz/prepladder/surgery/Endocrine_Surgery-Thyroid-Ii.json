Post-Surgical Management of Thyroid Cancers: Thyroxine Therapy: High-Risk Patients: Thyroxine is used to suppress TSH to prevent cancer recurrence. TSH was maintained at a lower normal limit. Low-Risk Patients: Thyroxine is given at physiological levels to maintain normal thyroid function. Radioiodine Therapy: Stop Thyroxine (T4): Discontinue thyroxine for 6 weeks to increase TSH levels (Option B), enhancing iodine uptake. If intolerable, switch to triiodothyronine (T3) for 2 weeks or use recombinant TSH. (Option C) Whole-Body Scan: Performed to detect and ablate any residual thyroid tissue or cancer cells. Radioactive iodine (RAI) has no role in Medullary carcinoma Imaging and follow-up: Ultrasound Neck and Chest X-ray. To detect recurrence: Thyroglobulin Levels: Monitored as a marker for cancer recurrence. PET Scan has maximum sensitivity for detecting recurrence and is indicated if thyroglobulin levels rise despite normal ultrasound and chest X-ray. RAI ablation can be repeated if cancer recurs .

      "correct_answer": "D",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: D) Hypercalcemia Explanation: Hypercalcemia is not a typical complication following thyroidectomy. Instead, parathyroid insufficiency is more common, which can lead to hypocalcemia (low calcium levels). Complications of Thyroidectomy: Hemorrhage: Bleeding from muscular arteries or slippage of ligature from superior thyroid vessels. Complication: Tension hematoma causing respiratory distress. (Option A) Management: Immediate re-operation, open sutures, control bleeding, drain hematoma, and close the wound. Respiratory Obstruction: Primary Cause: Laryngeal edema from extubation injury. (Most Common Complication) Other Causes: RLN palsy and tension hematoma. Nerve Injury: Commonly Injured Nerve: External branch of the superior laryngeal nerve. Other Injuries: RLN Injury causing palsy (Option C) and cervical sympathetic trunk causing Horner's syndrome . (Option B) Parathyroid Insufficiency: Ligating the inferior thyroid artery away from the thyroid leads to parathyroid vascular infarction. Causes hypocalcemia (low calcium levels) presenting 2–5 days post-surgery. Thyroid Insufficiency: Total thyroidectomy leads to hypothyroidism and requires lifelong levothyroxine replacement. Thyrotoxic Crisis: Inadequate preoperative preparation in hyperthyroid patients, leading to the release of thyroid hormones during surgery.

      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: A) Antithyroid drugs followed by total thyroidectomy Explanation: The patient has toxic multinodular goitre , also known as Plummer’s disease, characterized by multiple overactive thyroid nodules causing hyperthyroidism. It is more common in females and is the second most common cause of hyperthyroidism. Toxic multinodular goitre Also known as Plummer’s disease, characterized by multiple overactive thyroid nodules causing hyperthyroidism. Epidemiology More common in females and occurs often after 60 years of age Second most common cause of hyperthyroidism More prevalent in Iodine deficient region Pathophysiology Chronic iodine deficiency or thyroid dysfunction → reduced hormone production → increased hypothalamic TRH secretion → persistent TSH stimulation of the thyroid gland → hyperplasia of thyroid nodules Multiple somatic mutations of TSH receptor occur in long-standing goiters (> 60% of cases) → autonomous functioning of nodules (toxic MNG) → hyperthyroidism Clinical features Painless goiter with multiple palpable nodules Symptoms of thyrotoxicosis Lab investigations ↑ T3 and ↓ TSH Neck USG - multiple nodules within the thyroid parenchyma Increased radioiodine uptake by multiple hyperfunctioning (hot) nodules Decreased uptake by the rest of the gland Hypofunctioning or cold nodules may also be present in the multinodular gland. Management Antithyroid drugs followed by Total Thyroidectomy are preferred. Antithyroid drugs (Carbimazole, Methimazole) are to make the patient euthyroid and stabilize the patient before surgery. Total thyroidectomy is to remove the toxic nodules and resolve the underlying problem. Radioactive Iodine Therapy: Add - “(Iodine-131)” Alternative or adjunctive treatment to destroy overactive thyroid tissue, especially useful if surgery is not feasible or desired (Option B) Given in high doses as uptake is less compared to graves . Hence, it is not preferred before surgery. Thyroid hormone replacement therapy (Option C) is not used for treating hyperthyroidism; it is used for managing hypothyroidism. Treatment with lugol iodine followed by surgery (Option D) can lead to the Jod-Basedow phenomenon , where excessive iodine can exacerbate hyperthyroidism , particularly in patients with multinodular goitre. Hence, it is avoided.",

Killian’s incision (Option A): In septoplasty for a deviated septum, a curvilinear incision is made 2-3 mm above the caudal end of the septal cartilage on the concave side. Gridiron incision (Option B): In appendectomy, Gridiron incision is made perpendicular to the right spinoumbilical line at the McBurney’s point. Lanz crease incision (Option D) is made centering at McBurney’s point, as shown above. It is also used in appendectomy and is cosmetically better than other incisions.",

      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: C) Bones, hematogenous Explanation: The given clinical scenario is a case of follicular carcinoma , in which the most common site of metastasis is bone, and the route is hematogenous. Lymphatic spread is not seen. Pulsatile secondaries are osteolytic, vascular metastases due to increased vascularity of the deposits. They are seen in renal cell carcinoma (RCC) and follicular thyroid carcinoma. Lungs, lymphatic: In papillary carcinoma of the thyroid, the most common site of metastasis is the lungs and route via lymphatics ( Option A) Liver, lymphatic (Option B): In medullary carcinoma, the route of spread is both lymphatic and hematogenous (Option D) , and the site of metastasis is the liver.

      },
      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: C) Berry’s ligament Explanation: One of the most commonly nerve injured during thyroidectomy is the Recurrent laryngeal nerve (RLN), a branch of the vagus nerve. Berry’s ligament is the most common site of RLN injury during thyroidectomy because the nerve is directly associated with this region as it enters the larynx. The RLN provides motor innervation to all intrinsic muscles of the larynx (except the cricothyroid muscle , which is innervated by the external branch of the superior laryngeal nerve). It controls the vocal cords, playing a crucial role in voice production and airway protection. The RLN loops around the right subclavian artery, but this is generally not the site of most common RLN injuries during thyroid surgery ( Option A) The left RLN loops under the arch of the aorta before ascending to the larynx. Injury to this nerve can occur with excessive manipulation or dissection around the aortic arch, but it is less common than injury at the level of Berry's ligament ( Option B) The tubercle of Zuckerkandl (ZT) is the most posterolateral portion of the thyroid gland, where the RLN is typically located beneath. Injuries here are less common compared to Berry's Ligament ( Option D)",

While the common carotid artery is the source of the external carotid artery, it does not directly supply the thyroid gland. Subclavian Artery (Option B): The subclavian artery gives rise to the thyrocervical trunk, which branches into the inferior thyroid artery. Brachiocephalic Trunk (Option D) (or innominate artery) gives rise to the right common carotid and right subclavian arteries but does not directly supply the thyroid gland.
