      "explanation": "Correct Answer: D) Initiate fluid resuscitation Explanation: The immediate priority in managing variceal bleeding is stabilizing the patient's condition. This involves the airway, breathing, and circulation. Establishing intravenous access with large-bore cannulae allows for rapid fluid resuscitation , ideally with blood transfusions, to restore circulatory volume and address hypotension. Option A) While endoscopy is crucial for diagnosis and definitive treatment of variceal bleeding, it should only be performed after the patient is hemodynamically stable. Option B) Proton pump inhibitors reduce gastric acid secretion but have no role in the initial management of acute variceal bleeding. Option C) CT scanning can help evaluate the liver and portal vein, but it is not a priority during the initial resuscitation phase.

This intervention is temporary and used in the emergency setting until definitive treatments, such as endoscopic procedures, can be performed.

      },
      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: A. Right heart failure Explanation: Post-TIPSS, the increased preload from the diverted blood flow can overwhelm the right heart, leading to right heart failure. This presents as severe dyspnea, peripheral edema, jugular venous distension, and hypotension. The management includes the use of diuretics to reduce fluid overload. TIPSS (Transjugular Intrahepatic Porto Systemic Shunt) It is a nonselective shunt used to treat complications of portal hypertension. The liver is accessed through the Jugular vein and the stent is placed to create a channel between the right Hepatic vein and the right branch of the portal vein. Reduces portal pressure by diverting blood flow. Indications Contraindications Variceal bleeding Refractory ascites Hepatic hydrothorax Budd Chiari Syndrome Portal Hypertensive gastropathy Severe hepatic encephalopathy Severe heart failure Severe pulmonary hypertension Uncontrolled systemic infection Polycystic liver disease Option B: The hepatorenal syndrome occurs in advanced liver disease characterized by renal failure due to altered renal perfusion without structural kidney damage. It presents with renal dysfunction (e.g., oliguria, elevated serum creatinine) rather than severe dyspnea, peripheral edema, and jugular venous distension. Option C : Pulmonary hypertension can occur in liver disease but is less likely to cause acute severe dyspnea, peripheral edema, and jugular venous distension immediately post-TIPSS. This condition usually develops gradually and presents with symptoms like fatigue, chest pain, and dyspnea on exertion. Option D : Porto-pulmonary hypertension develops over time and is characterized by increased pulmonary artery pressure.",

        "D": "Portal vein thrombosis"
      },
      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: A. Encephalopathy Explanation: Encephalopathy is a common complication following the creation of a non-selective shunt like the side-to-side portocaval shunt (SSPCS). This is because the shunt allows portal blood which contains toxins, to bypass the liver and enter the systemic circulation directly, leading to hepatic encephalopathy. Non-Selective Shunts: Non-selective shunts are surgical procedures used to manage portal hypertension by diverting blood flow from the portal venous system directly into the systemic circulation, bypassing the liver. This reduces portal pressure and decreases complications like variceal bleeding. However, they also reduce hepatic blood flow, potentially leading to liver ischemia and worsening hepatic function. Side-to-side portocaval Shunt (SSPCS) involves a side-to-side anastomosis between the portal vein and the inferior vena cava. Used for conditions such as Budd-Chiari syndrome, veno-occlusive disease, and refractory ascites. Most widely performed shunt due to its effectiveness in reducing portal pressure. High risk of hepatic encephalopathy due to the diversion of blood away from the liver, reducing its detoxification capacity. Other Non-Selective Shunts: Eck Fistula is an end-to-side portocaval shunt where the portal vein is divided, and its proximal part is sutured to the inferior vena cava. Interposition Grafts - A vascular graft is used to connect the portal vein to the systemic circulation. Types include portocaval, mesocaval (superior mesenteric vein to inferior vena cava), and mesorenal (superior mesenteric vein to left renal vein) grafts. Used when a direct shunt is not feasible or preferred. IVC - Inferior Vena Cava; P/C - Porto-caval; M/C - Meso-caval; M/R - Meso-renal; PV - Portal Vein; SMV - Superior Mesenteric Vein; SV - Splenic Vein; Left RV - Left Renal Vein Proximal Splenorenal Shunt (PSRS) or Linton’s Shunt After a splenectomy, the proximal part of the splenic vein is sutured to the left renal vein. Option B : While renal failure can occur in advanced liver disease, it is not a direct complication of SSPCS. Renal failure is more associated with hepatorenal syndrome in the context of cirrhosis and severe liver dysfunction. Option C: SSPCS is designed to reduce portal pressure and prevent variceal bleeding. Therefore, recurrent variceal bleeding is less likely to occur after the procedure. Option D: While possible, portal vein thrombosis is not the most common complication of SSPCS.",

      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: A. Distal splenorenal shunt (DSRS) Explanation: Selective Shunts: Selective shunts are designed to divert blood from specific parts of the portal system, preserving some hepatic portal perfusion and reducing the risk of hepatic encephalopathy. Distal Splenorenal Shunt (DSRS) or Warren Shunt The distal part of the splenic vein is anastomosed to the left renal vein. Selectively decompresses the spleen and gastroesophageal junction varices while maintaining hepatic portal flow. Lower risk of encephalopathy compared to non-selective shunts. Inokuchi Shunt Involves an interposition graft between the left gastric vein and the inferior vena cava. Used for selectively draining the gastroesophageal junction, particularly in patients with gastroesophageal varices. Option B: Proximal splenorenal shunt (PSRS), after splenectomy, connects the proximal splenic vein to the left renal vein but does not specifically focus on preserving portal perfusion to the liver. Option C: Side-to-side portocaval shunt (SSPCS) diverts a significant portion of portal blood flow to the inferior vena cava, reducing portal pressure but not preserving liver perfusion. Option D: Interposition grafts are non-selective shunts that can be used to connect the portal vein to the systemic circulation.",

        "D": "Splenomegaly"
      },
      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: A. Enlarged caudate lobe Explanation: The enlarged caudate lobe is a hallmark of chronic Budd Chiari Syndrome. The caudate lobe has its own venous drainage directly into the inferior vena cava, allowing it to remain viable and potentially enlarge when the rest of the liver is affected by venous outflow obstruction. Budd-Chiari Syndrome is characterized by hepatic venous outflow obstruction, leading to liver congestion, ischemia, and damage. Etiology: The most common cause is hepatic venous thrombosis. Other causes include inferior vena cava obstruction. Risk Factors: Polycythemia vera, thrombophilic disorders, and malignancies are significant risk factors. Clinical Features The characteristic triad includes ascites, hepatomegaly, and abdominal pain. Jaundice, encephalopathy, anorexia, and fatigue may occur if hepatic failure develops. Diagnosis and Treatment Venography is the investigation of choice, showing spider web collaterals if the hepatic veins are involved, or vena cavography if the inferior vena cava is obstructed. Treatment includes anticoagulants, thrombolysis (if within the window period), and surgical intervention. In cases of liver failure, liver transplantation is the treatment of choice. Option B: Ascites can occur in both acute and chronic Budd Chiari Syndrome and is not specific to the chronic stage of the disease. Option C: While hepatic vein thrombosis is a key feature of Budd-Chiari Syndrome, it can be present in both acute and chronic stages and does not specifically indicate chronicity. Option D: Splenomegaly is a common finding due to portal hypertension but can be seen in both acute and chronic phases, thus not specifically indicative of chronic disease.
