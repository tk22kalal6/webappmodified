      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: A) Thompson Procedure Explanation: The Thompson procedure is a type of excisional operative procedure that involves removing unhealthy tissues. Lymphedematous tissue is removed beneath the skin flaps. The epidermis and part of the dermis from one of these skin flaps are carefully shaved off with a Humby's knife. This shaved tissue is placed under the opposite flap, positioned deep beneath the deep fascia, similar to a Swiss roll. Reconstructive Operation It is indicated in patients with proximal (either primary or secondary) obstruction of the extremity, lymphatic obstruction, and dilated lymphatics distal to the obstruction.",

      "question": "A 35-year-old man presents to the emergency department with a rapidly spreading reddish streak on his left arm, accompanied by fever and swollen axillary lymph nodes. He reports sustaining a small cut on his hand two days ago while gardening. Physical examination reveals a tender, warm, erythematous streak extending from the hand to the upper arm, with blanching on pressure. What is the next best step in the management of this patient?",

        "D": "Watchful waiting for 48 hours before initiating any treatment"
      },
      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "cloxacillin Correct Answer: C) Limb elevation and initiation of intravenous antibiotics like penicillin or cloxacillin Explanation: The rapidly spreading reddish streak on the arm, accompanied by fever and swollen regional (axillary) lymph nodes, are classic signs of acute lymphangitis. The recent history of a small cut while gardening provides a likely entry point for the causative organisms. The treatment primarily involves administration of broad-spectrum antibiotics (e.g. penicillin, cloxacillin) & elevation and rest of affected limb. Acute Lymphangitis Definition Acute nonsuppurative infection and spreading inflammation of lymphatics of skin and subcutaneous tissues Causative Organisms • Beta-hemolytic streptococci • Staphylococci • Clostridial organisms (less common) Risk Factors • Small trauma or skin break • In endemic areas: Wuchereria bancrofti (transmitted by Culex mosquito) Clinical Features • Streaky redness which is spreading (typical) • Pain • Fever • Palpable tender regional lymph nodes • Blanching on pressure • Fever, tachycardia (features of toxemia) Complications • Abscess formation • Toxaemia, septicemia • Chronic lymphangitis leading to acquired lymphoedema Investigations • Complete blood count • Renal and liver function tests • Blood culture Management • Broad-spectrum antibiotics (e.g. penicillin, cloxacillin) • Elevation and rest of affected limb • Glycerine magnesium sulphate dressing • Management of toxemia or septicemia if present Immediate surgical incision and drainage of the affected area (Option A) is not an appropriate treatment in managing uncomplicated lymphangitis. Oral antihistamines and topical corticosteroids (Option B) are more appropriate for allergic reactions rather than bacterial infections. Watchful waiting for 48 hours before initiating any treatment (Option D) is not appropriate given the rapid spread of infection and presence of systemic symptoms (fever). Prompt treatment with antibiotics is necessary to prevent complications.",
