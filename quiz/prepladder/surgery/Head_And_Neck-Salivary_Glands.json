        "D": "Frey’s syndrome is characterized by sweating and flushing in the preauricular area during meals."
      },
      "correct_answer": "D",
      "explanation": "area during meals. Correct Answer: D) Frey’s syndrome is characterized by sweating and flushing in the preauricular area during meals. Explanation: Frey’s syndrome, also known as gustatory sweating, can occur after parotidectomy due to aberrant nerve regeneration, leading to sweating and flushing in the preauricular area during meals. This complication has an incidence of about 10%. Complications of Pleomorphic Adenoma: Tumor-related Complications: Recurrence: (Option B ruled out) Pleomorphic adenomas can recur after surgery, especially if not completely excised. Factors contributing to recurrence include tumour spillage during surgery, inadequate surgical margins, and microscopic extensions (pseudopods). Malignant Transformation: Although typically benign, pleomorphic adenomas can undergo malignant transformation into carcinoma ex pleomorphic adenoma. This risk increases in long-standing tumours (over 15 years) or recurrent tumours, with a risk exceeding 15%. Indicators of malignant transformation include sudden tumour growth, pain, tissue fixation, skin ulceration, and facial nerve involvement. Treatment-Related Complications: Surgical Complications (Parotidectomy): Facial Nerve Injury: Common (30% temporary weakness), but permanent paralysis can occur (rarely). (Option A ruled out) Risk factors include tumour size, location, and surgical technique. Hemorrhage: Significant bleeding is rare but may require transfusion or re-operation. Infection: Postoperative infection risk can be minimized with sterile techniques and prophylactic antibiotics. Sialocele: Accumulation of saliva in tissue pockets due to duct damage during surgery. Frey's Syndrome: Characterized by sweating, flushing, and pain in the preauricular area during meals, with a 10% incidence. Cosmetic Deformities: Includes scarring, hollowing of the retromandibular area, and earlobe numbness due to great auricular nerve injury. Complications of Other Treatments: Radiotherapy: Used in cases of recurrence, high-grade transformation, or incomplete excision. (Option C ruled out) Risks include xerostomia, damage to surrounding tissues, and potential secondary malignancies. Fine-Needle Aspiration Cytology (FNAC): Generally safe, but can cause bleeding or, rarely, tumour seeding along the needle track.",

      "question": "A 28-y/o male presents with a painless, soft swelling in the submandibular region that has been gradually enlarging over the past 2 months. On examination, the swelling is dumbbell-shaped, fluctuant, and bidigitally palpable. The overlying mucosa appears thick with a bluish hue. Fine needle aspiration yields a viscous, \"egg white-like\" fluid with high amylase content, confirming the diagnosis. What is the most appropriate treatment for this patient?",
      "options": {
        "A": "Incision and drainage of the cyst",
        "B": "Marsupialization (unroofing) of the ranula",
        "C": "Surgical excision of the ranula and involved sublingual gland",
        "D": "Observation and follow-up"
      },
      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: C) Surgical excision of the ranula and involved sublingual gland Explanation: The given clinical scenario suggests that this is a case of plunging ranula. Surgical excision of both the ranula and the involved sublingual gland is the definitive treatment. This approach reduces the risk of recurrence and addresses the underlying cause of the ranula. Plunging Ranula Definition When a ranula extends into the submandibular region through the deeper part of the posterior margin of the mylohyoid muscle it is called a plunging ranula. Key Features Painless, soft, fluctuant dumbbell-shaped swelling in the submandibular region or sublingual area. It is bidigitally palpable. May have a bluish hue and thick overlying mucosa. Often presents with both oral and cervical components. Typically occurs in the third decade of life. Diagnosis Based on history, clinical features, and imaging. Fine needle aspiration yields a viscous, \"egg white-like\" fluid with high amylase content. Ultrasonography or CT shows a well-circumscribed cystic mass extending through the mylohyoid muscle. Treatment Surgical excision of the ranula and involved sublingual gland is the definitive treatment. Recurrence is possible if the sublingual gland is not completely removed. Incision and drainage of the cyst (Option A) may provide temporary relief but are not definitive treatments for a plunging ranula. This approach does not address the underlying cause and is associated with a high risk of recurrence. Marsupialization (unroofing) of the ranula (Option B): While marsupialization can be used for smaller ranulas, it is less effective for plunging ranulas, which often require complete excision to prevent recurrence. Observation and follow-up (Option D): Observation alone is not appropriate for a plunging ranula, as the cyst is likely to continue growing and causing further symptoms. Definitive surgical treatment is required to prevent complications and recurrence.",

      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: A) Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) Explanation: MRI is the most appropriate imaging modality to confirm the diagnosis of a ranula. It provides detailed information about the extent of the lesion and helps differentiate it from other lesions, such as lymphangiomas. Ranula Definition Ranulas are a type of extravasation mucocele , caused by the rupture of the main duct or obstructed acini of the sublingual gland. They appear as bluish swellings on the floor of the mouth and resemble the belly of a frog. Location Commonly found in the anterior floor of the mouth. When it extends through the mylohyoid muscle, it presents as a submental swelling known as a \"plunging ranula.\" Symptoms Typically soft, fluctuant, and painless unless infected. Diagnosis Confirmed through Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) Ultrasound Aspiration of thick sticky saliva differentiates it from a lymphangioma. Treatment Removal of the sublingual gland is preferred. Incision, drainage, and marsupialization have low success rates. Although marsupialization is often adequate, it has a higher",

      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: C) External shock wave lithotripsy (ESWL) Explanation: ESWL is an appropriate treatment for larger stones (7–10 mm) that are not easily accessible via endoscopy. It uses shock waves to break the stone into smaller fragments that can then pass through the duct or be removed by other means. Sialolithiasis Definition Formation of salivary gland stones within the gland ducts Commonly Affected Age 30 to 60 years Commonly Affected Gland Submandibular gland (85%), due to its ascending duct course and the mucinous, viscous saliva it produces, leads to stagnation and stone formation. Risk Factors Duct abnormalities Inflammation Increased calcium content in saliva Chronic dehydration Medications causing decreased salivary flow Clinical Features Cyclical postprandial swelling, dryness, asymmetrical gland enlargement, palpable stone, possible abscess formation. Submandibular Swelling Diagnostic Methods Conventional Radiographs : Initial diagnostic test, but may miss small stones. CT Scanning, USG, Magnetic Resonance Sialogram : More sensitive, especially for small stones. Sialography : Gold standard; involves dye injection for diagnosis and potential therapeutic use.",

      "question": "A 45 y/o woman is undergoing surgery for the removal of a submandibular gland mass. Postoperatively, she complains of numbness and a burning sensation of her tongue. Which nerve is most likely to have been injured during the procedure?",
      "options": {
        "A": "Facial Nerve",
        "B": "Lingual Nerve",
        "C": "Hypoglossal Nerve",
        "D": "Glossopharyngeal Nerve"
      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Correct answer: B) Lingual Nerve Explanation: The lingual nerve , a branch of the mandibular division of the trigeminal nerve (V3), is the most commonly injured nerve during submandibular gland surgery. This is due to its course, which brings it into proximity to the submandibular gland and its duct, making it highly susceptible to damage during surgical procedures in this area. The lingual nerve originates from the posterior division of the mandibular nerve (V3) in the infratemporal fossa. It then descends and moves forward, initially positioned medially to the lateral pterygoid muscle and deep to the ramus of the mandible. As it enters the floor of the mouth, it lies superficial to the hyoglossus muscle and deep to the submandibular duct. The nerve loops under the duct, passing from lateral to medial, before ascending to supply sensory innervation to the anterior two-thirds of the tongue. This intricate course places the lingual nerve close to the submandibular gland, making it particularly susceptible to injury during surgical procedures in this area. Facial Nerve (Option A): The facial nerve is responsible for motor innervation to the muscles of facial expression. It is more commonly at risk during parotid gland surgeries rather than submandibular gland surgeries . Hypoglossal Nerve (Option C): The hypoglossal nerve supplies motor innervation to the muscles of the tongue. While it runs near the submandibular gland, it is usually located deeper and more posteriorly compared to the lingual nerve, making it less likely to be injured during submandibular gland surgery. Glossopharyngeal Nerve (Option D): The glossopharyngeal nerve primarily provides sensory innervation to the oropharynx and the posterior third of the tongue. It is anatomically distant from the submandibular gland and is not typically at risk during submandibular gland surgery.",

      "question": "A 60 y/o man with a diagnosis of adenoid cystic carcinoma has undergone surgical resection of a tumour located in the palate. Postoperative imaging reveals no residual tumour but shows the involvement of regional lymph nodes. What is the most appropriate additional treatment for this patient?",
      "options": {
        "A": "Additional surgical resection",
        "B": "External beam radiotherapy",
        "C": "Preoperative chemotherapy",
        "D": "Observation and regular follow-up"
      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Correct answer: B) External beam radiotherapy Explanation: External beam radiotherapy is the most appropriate additional treatment given the involvement of regional lymph nodes. Adenoid cystic carcinoma is considered to be a radio-sensitive tumour, and as such, radiotherapy is often used in its management, usually in the postoperative setting. Radiotherapy is effective in targeting residual microscopic disease and reducing the risk of recurrence in the lymph nodes which is crucial in managing adenoid cystic carcinoma. Additional surgical resection (Option A): Further surgical intervention might be considered if there were residual diseases or if the tumour had not been completely removed. However, in this case, the imaging shows no residual tumour but regional lymph node involvement. Additional surgery might not address the lymph node involvement effectively and could increase the risk of complications. Preoperative chemotherapy (Option C): Chemotherapy is not typically used as a preoperative treatment for adenoid cystic carcinoma. It is not as effective as radiotherapy in the context of adenoid cystic carcinoma and is generally reserved for cases with distant metastases or palliative care. Observation and regular follow-up (Option D): While regular follow-up is essential to monitor for recurrence, observation alone is inadequate given the lymph node involvement.

      "question": "A 60 y/o man presents with a slow-growing, painless mass in the submandibular region. O/E, the mass is firm and non-tender and biopsy reveals a tumor with a combination of tubular and solid histological patterns. Imaging shows perineural invasion extending towards the base of the skull. Which histopathological type in this carcinoma is associated with the worst prognosis?",

        "A": "Cribriform",
        "B": "Tubular",
        "C": "Solid",
        "D": "Papillary"
      },
      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Correct answer: C) Solid Explanation: The clinical features suggest adenoid cystic carcinoma which is a slow-growing malignant tumor composed of both epithelial and myoepithelial cells. It is notable for its tendency to spread along nerve pathways. The solid pattern is linked to the worst prognosis due to its aggressive nature, higher propensity for recurrence, and increased risk of metastasis. It often necessitates more extensive surgical intervention. This type of cancer primarily affects the submandibular and sublingual salivary glands, with approximately half of the cases occurring in minor salivary glands, especially in the palate. It is relatively rare in the parotid gland. Clinical features: Facial nerve palsy Pain or numbness High risk of distant metastasis especially - lung. Histopathology of adenoid cystic carcinoma: Type: Unencapsulated, infiltrative biphasic neoplasm. Cell Types: Variable proportions of epithelial and myoepithelial cells. Patterns: Cribriform: Cells around sharply punched-out cylindromatous spaces with basophilic matrix. Most common type and has a better prognosis. (Option A ruled out) Tubular: Bilayered tubules with a true lumen. (Option B ruled out) Solid: Sheets and nests of tumour cells without a lumen. Carries poor prognosis. (Option C) Nuclear Features: Small, angulated, hyperchromatic nuclei with scant cytoplasm. Perineural Invasion: Common in adenoid cystic carcinoma. High-Grade Transformation: Can occur. Immunohistochemistry: Ductal cells: Positive for c-KIT. Myoepithelial cells: Positive for p63 and SMA. Papillary (Option D): Papillary is not a recognized histological type for adenoid cystic carcinoma, making it an irrelevant option in this context.

        "B": "Mammaglobin",
        "C": "S100",
        "D": "Ki-67"
      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Correct answer: B) Mammaglobin Explanation: Mammaglobin is a protein commonly expressed in secretory carcinoma but not in acinic cell carcinoma. The absence of mammaglobin in acinic cell carcinoma is a key feature used to distinguish it from secretory carcinoma, making it a useful diagnostic marker. Acinar cell carcinoma Tumor cells resemble normal serous acinar cells. They are rarely malignant. Immunohistochemically they are positive for DOG1 and SOX10 and negative for mammaglobin. Treatment: Radical excision p53 (Option A) is a tumour suppressor gene that is often used to assess mutations in various cancers but is not specific for distinguishing these two types of carcinoma. S100 (Option C) is a protein expressed in various cell types and can be positive in many salivary gland tumours, including acinic cell carcinoma. However, it is not specific enough to differentiate acinic cell carcinoma from secretory carcinoma, as it can be positive in both tumour types. Ki-67 (Option D): Ki-67 is a proliferation marker used to assess the growth rate of tumour cells. While it provides information on the aggressiveness of a tumour, it is not specific to acinic cell carcinoma or secretory carcinoma and cannot be used to differentiate between the two.

      "question": "A 45 y/o female has a firm, enlarging swelling below her left ear for 6 months. O/E, the swelling is hard and nodular, with no signs of facial nerve involvement. FNAC shows malignant cells, and imaging reveals a tumour in both lobes of the parotid gland with no distant metastases. What is the most likely diagnosis?",

        "C": "Adenoid cystic carcinoma",
        "D": "Warthin’s tumor"
      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Correct answer: B) Mucoepidermoid carcinoma Explanation: Mucoepidermoid carcinoma is the correct diagnosis in this scenario. Mucoepidermoid carcinoma is the most common malignant tumour of the parotid gland, particularly in adults. The slow-growing, firm, and nodular swelling in the parotid region, combined with the FNAC findings of malignancy , strongly indicates this type of carcinoma. The absence of facial nerve involvement and the slow progression further support this diagnosis, as these features are typical of low- to intermediate-grade mucoepidermoid carcinoma. High-grade carcinoma typically is locally aggressive and shows nodal metastases. Pleomorphic adenoma (Option A): This is a benign salivary gland tumour and the most common neoplasm of the parotid gland. It typically presents as a painless, mobile, and slow-growing mass. Adenoid cystic carcinoma (Option C): While adenoid cystic carcinoma is another malignant salivary gland tumour, it is more commonly associated with minor salivary glands and tends to show a propensity for perineural invasion, often leading to early facial nerve involvement. Warthin’s tumor (Option D) or Cystadenoma lymphomatosum, is a benign salivary gland tumor, commonly found in the parotid gland. It typically presents as a painless, cystic mass, often in older males.

      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "tumour. Correct Answer: B) A Tc99 pertechnetate scan showing a \"hotspot\" is indicative of Warthin's tumour. Explanation: Warthin's tumour shows increased uptake on Tc99 pertechnetate scans because of its high mitochondrial content. Histopathological features include papillary structures, cystic spaces, oncocytic epithelial cells, and lymphoid stroma. Tc99 Pertechnetate Scan: Purpose : Assesses salivary gland function and detects abnormal areas. Hot Spot : Increased uptake of the radioactive tracer, indicating high mitochondrial content typical of Warthin's tumour. (Option D ruled out) Histopathology (HPE): (Option C ruled out) Papillary Structures: Finger-like projections extending into cystic spaces. Cystic Spaces: Fluid-filled cavities within the tumor. Oncocytic Epithelial Cells: Two layers of cells with abundant mitochondria lining the papillary and cystic areas. Lymphoid Stroma: Supporting tissue with lymphocytes and germinal centres, resembling lymph node tissue. It is best identified on imaging by its hypoechoic appearance and confirmed with FNAC (Option A): While FNAC is used for diagnosis, Warthin's tumour typically shows a \"hot spot\" on Tc99 pertechnetate scans due to high mitochondrial content, not just hypoechoic appearance.

        "B": "Submandibular gland",
        "C": "Sublingual gland",
        "D": "Minor salivary glands"
      },
      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "Correct answer: A) Parotid gland Explanation: The parotid gland is the largest salivary gland and secretes saliva through Stensen’s duct , which opens into the oral cavity near the upper second molar. They are primarily serous glands that produce watery saliva. The duct emerges from the anterior surface of the parotid gland, travels over the masseter muscle, pierces the buccinator muscle, and opens into the oral cavity opposite the crown of the upper second molar tooth. Note: Acini are the basic secretory units of salivary glands. They are small, sac-like clusters of cells that produce saliva. The acinar cells release saliva into the ducts. The types of acinar cells determine the type of saliva secreted, and salivary glands can contain serous acini (producing watery saliva), mucous acini (producing thick saliva), or a mix of both. Submandibular gland (Option B): This gland secretes saliva through Wharton’s duct, which opens beside the frenulum of the tongue on the floor of the mouth. The submandibular glands produce a more viscous and mucous type of saliva compared to the parotid glands. Sublingual gland (Option C): The sublingual gland has multiple small ducts (ducts of Rivinus) that drain directly into the floor of the mouth or join the submandibular duct. The saliva from the sublingual glands is primarily mucous, but these glands do not utilize Stensen's duct for secretion. Minor salivary glands (Option D): These glands do not have a single named duct. Instead, they drain directly into the mucosa through numerous small ducts throughout the oral cavity. These glands produce a small amount of saliva, contributing to approximately 10% of the total salivary volume, and drain directly into the mucosa through numerous small ducts.",

        "C": "Surgical excision with a margin of normal tissue",
        "D": "Enucleation of the tumour"
      },
      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: C) Surgical excision with a margin of normal tissue Explanation: The clinical presentation and findings suggest a diagnosis of Pleomorphic Adenoma . Surgical excision with a margin of normal tissue is the most appropriate management for pleomorphic adenoma. The goal is to remove the tumour completely with a margin of normal tissue to prevent recurrence and avoid spillage of tumour cells. This approach minimizes the risk of malignant transformation and recurrence. Pleomorphic Adenoma : Clinical Presentation : Painless, well-defined, solitary, mobile masses. Commonly located in the parotid glands (>80% of cases). Can also occur in the submandibular gland and hard palate. Sudden growth of facial nerve palsy may suggest malignant transformation (rare). Imaging : USG: Well-lobulated, hypoechoic lesions with possible calcifications. CT: Provides detailed anatomical imaging along with the extent of the tumour. MRI: Helps differentiate between benign and malignant tumours Fine-Needle Aspiration Cytology (FNAC) : Differentiates between inflammatory conditions and tumour- high sensitivity and specificity Histopathology : Gross Examination: Tumours are well-circumscribed, nodular, and firm, with a white to tan cut surface. May show cartilaginous areas; large tumours may exhibit degeneration or cystic changes. Microscopy: A mixture of epithelial, myoepithelial, and stromal components. Possible malignant changes: Ductal atypia, diffuse fibrosis, or necrosis Treatment: Surgical Excision of the tumour along with a cuff of normal tissue. Enucleation is not recommended due to the risk of capsular breach, tumour spillage, and recurrence. (Option D ruled out) Observation and follow-up(Option A): Although the tumour is benign and asymptomatic, observation is not appropriate because pleomorphic adenomas can undergo malignant transformation over time. Radiotherapy(Option B): It is generally reserved for malignant tumours or cases where surgical excision is not possible.

        "C": "Surgical exploration and repair",
        "D": "Anticholinergic therapy with hyoscine bromide"
      },
      "correct_answer": "D",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: D) Anticholinergic therapy with hyoscine bromide Explanation: The clinical presentation and findings suggest a diagnosis of Parotid Fistula. Anticholinergic therapy is the most appropriate initial management. It reduces salivary secretion, which can decrease the flow through the fistula, potentially allowing it to close spontaneously. This non-invasive approach is preferred before considering more aggressive interventions like surgery. Parotid Fistula: Definition : A parotid fistula is an abnormal connection involving the parotid gland or its ducts, leading to saliva leakage. It can be: Internal: Draining into the mouth. External: Draining onto the skin. Discharge : Duct fistula: Typically profuse. Gland fistula: Minimal discharge. Investigations: Sialography: Identifies the origin of the fistula (gland, duct, or ductules). Other Imaging: Fistulogram, CT fistulogram, and MRI for detailed anatomy. Discharge Study: Amylase content analysis to confirm saliva. Management : Conservative : Anticholinergics (e.g., hyoscine bromide): Reduce salivary secretion. Radiotherapy: Low-dose radiation for longstanding fistulas. Surgical : Exploration and Repair: Dissect and repair the fistula tract; techniques like Newman Seabrock's operation may be used. Duct Repositioning: Redirects the duct into the oral mucosa. Auriculotemporal Nerve Sectioning: Reduces salivary flow by disrupting nerve supply. Total Conservative Parotidectomy: Last resort for persistent fistulas. Antibiotics and observation (Option A): Antibiotics may help with infection, but they don't address the salivary fistula itself. Sialography to evaluate the fistula (Option B): Sialography helps identify the origin and extent of the fistula but is not the initial management step. It is used primarily when planning surgery if conservative treatments fail. Surgical exploration and repair (Option C): Surgical intervention is reserved for cases where conservative management fails or the fistula persists long-term.

      "question": "A 60 y/o male undergoes a parotidectomy for a benign tumour located in the superficial lobe of the parotid gland. On the second postoperative day, he notices sweating and flushing in the area just in front of his ear when he eats. The patient also reports mild numbness of the earlobe. Which of the following nerves is most commonly affected?",
      "options": {
        "A": "Facial nerve",
        "B": "Auriculotemporal nerve",
        "C": "Great auricular nerve",
        "D": "Hypoglossal nerve"
      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: B) Auriculotemporal nerve Explanation: The given clinical presentation suggests Frey's Syndrome, also known as gustatory sweating, is the most likely cause of the sweating and flushing the patient experiences while eating, resulting from damage to the auriculotemporal nerve , which carries the parasympathetic fibres to the parotid gland. This condition occurs due to the aberrant regeneration of parasympathetic nerve fibres, leading to the cross-innervation of sweat glands in the area. Complications of Parotidectomy: Complication Description Temporary Facial Palsy Mostly the lower branches of the facial nerve - the marginal mandibular nerve. Most patients recover over time. Infection Rare, as parotidectomy is a clean procedure. Aseptic precautions and timely drain removal reduce the risk. Hematoma Formation Uncommon. Careful intraoperative hemostasis can prevent it. Larger hematomas may indicate a bleeding disorder and require management. Sialocele Formation Occurs if the main ductal system is exposed. Preventable with subcapsular dissection. Treatment: Anticholinergics, aspiration, and pressure dressings. Retromandibular area hollowing Can occur post-surgery Reduced by placing autologous fat grafts during the surgery. Frey’s Syndrome Also known as gustatory sweating; Caused by the cross-innervation of sweat glands by regenerating nerve fibres of the auriculotemporal nerve. (Option B) For mild cases : Give antiperspirants; Severe cases : Botulinum toxin injections or tympanic neurectomy. Permanent Facial Nerve Weakness D/t transection of the facial nerve during the surgery. (Option A ruled out) Facial Numbness Permanent numbness of the earlobe, D/t transection of the great auricular nerve during the surgery. (Option C ruled out) The hypoglossal nerve (Option D) causes deviation of the tongue towards the affected side. It does not supply the parotid gland or front of the ear.

      "question": "A 45 y/o patient presents with a parotid gland tumour located deep to the facial nerve. The tumour has been identified as malignant and has extended beyond the parotid gland. Given these findings, which surgical approach is most appropriate for this patient?",
      "options": {
        "A": "Radical parotidectomy",
        "B": "Total conservative parotidectomy",
        "C": "Superficial parotidectomy",
        "D": "Adequate parotidectomy"
      },
      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: A) Radical Parotidectomy Explanation: This procedure involves the complete removal of the parotid gland along with any involved facial nerve branches. It is typically indicated for malignant tumours that have extended beyond the gland, making it the most appropriate choice for this patient's condition. Types of Parotidectomy: Type Description Extracapsular Dissection Tumor removed. No facial nerve dissection. ↓ Chances of temporary facial palsy. Adequate Parotidectomy (Option D ruled out) Tumor removal along with some healthy tissue. Aimed to preserve the gland. Challenging if the tumour is near the facial nerve. Superficial Parotidectomy (Option C ruled out) Performed when the tumour is located lateral to the facial nerve. Total Parotidectomy Indicated when the tumour is deep to the facial nerve. Total Conservative Parotidectomy (Option B ruled out) Involves removing both superficial and deep lobes while preserving the facial nerves. Used for tumours crossing the facial nerve plane. Radical Parotidectomy Complete removal of the parotid gland, including any involved facial nerve branches, for malignant tumours extending beyond the gland. Common Incisions: Modified Blair Incision: A preauricular incision curving under the earlobe and extending along the anterior border of the sternocleidomastoid. Facelift Incision: Similar to the modified Blair incision, but with the posterior part curving into the hairline to avoid a neck incision.

      "question": "A 62 y/o woman presents with a recurrent adenoid cystic carcinoma of the submandibular gland. The tumour has been surgically resected twice before, and each time, the pathology report showed perineural invasion. What is the most appropriate next step in managing her condition?",
      "options": {
        "A": "Repeat surgical excision",
        "B": "Radiation therapy",
        "C": "Chemotherapy",
        "D": "Targeted therapy"
      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Correct answer: B) Radiation therapy Explanation: Given the tumour's tendency for perineural spread and the risk of local recurrence, radiation therapy is an appropriate adjuvant treatment to help control the disease. Radiation therapy uses high-energy rays to destroy cancer cells and is often used as adjuvant therapy after surgery or as the primary treatment for inoperable tumours. Perineural invasion, common in adenoid cystic carcinoma, refers to cancer spreading along nerves. Radiation therapy targets these tumour extensions to reduce recurrence. Radiotherapy Indications Adenoid cystic carcinomas After surgery for malignant salivary gland tumours High-grade tumours Close/inadequate clearance margin Deep lobe tumour Perineural spread Vascular involvement Multiple neck node involvement Recurrent malignant tumours Recurrent pleomorphic adenoma Repeat surgical excision (Option A) aims to remove salivary gland tumours with negative margins (no cancer cells at the edges of the removed tissue). However, due to perineural invasion and recurrent surgeries, it risks damaging vital structures and incomplete removal, making it unsuitable in this case. Chemotherapy (Option C): It is not typically the first-line treatment for adenoid cystic carcinoma, especially in cases of localized recurrence. Chemotherapy is more often used for systemic control when there is evidence of distant metastases or when other treatments are not feasible. Targeted Therapy (Option D): Targeted therapy uses drugs that specifically target molecules involved in cancer cell growth and survival. Salivary duct carcinomas often express androgen receptors and HER2 receptors, making them potential targets for therapies that block these receptors. However, targeted therapy is not currently a standard treatment for adenoid cystic carcinoma. Note: Neck dissection is usually performed in node-positive tumours, high-grade tumours, and malignant tumours with lymph nodal spread. It is also indicated for salivary duct carcinoma. The extent of Neck Dissection: Selective Neck Dissection : Targets specific lymph node groups based on the tumour’s location and pattern of spread. Modified Radical Neck Dissection : Removes lymph nodes from multiple levels but preserves the sternocleidomastoid muscle, internal jugular vein, and spinal accessory nerve. Radical Neck Dissection : Removes all lymph nodes in the neck, along with additional structures such as the sternocleidomastoid muscle, internal jugular vein, and spinal accessory nerve. This is more extensive and is generally reserved for cases with significant lymph node involvement or aggressive disease.",

      "question": "A 45 y/o woman presents with a progressively enlarging mass in her right parotid gland. The mass is non-tender and has been present for 6 months. An ultrasound revealed a well-defined hypoechoic lesion with no evidence of calcification or increased vascularity. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step for this patient?",

      },
      "correct_answer": "D",
      "explanation": "Correct answer: D) Fine-needle aspiration Cytology (FNAC) Explanation: FNAC is a minimally invasive procedure used to extract cells from the suspicious mass using a fine needle, which is then examined under a microscope. FNAC is highly sensitive and specific for distinguishing between inflammatory and neoplastic lesions and between benign and malignant tumours. It is the most appropriate next step for evaluating a parotid gland mass due to its simplicity, safety, and ability to guide further management based on the cytological findings. Sialography (Option A): It involves injecting a contrast dye into the salivary ductal system to visualize it on X-ray. This technique is useful for diagnosing ductal abnormalities such as sialolithiasis (stones) and sialectasis but is not particularly useful for assessing salivary gland tumours. Positron Emission Tomography (PET-CT) (Option B): It is typically used to detect distant metastases in high-grade salivary gland malignancies and to identify primary tumours when metastatic involvement of the salivary glands is suspected. PET-CT is not indicated as a first-line investigation for a parotid mass, especially without suspicion of malignancy. Core Needle Biopsy (Option C): It involves taking a larger sample of tissue compared to FNAC and is more invasive. It is typically reserved for situations where FNAC results are inconclusive or additional tissue is needed for a more accurate diagnosis. Given the availability of FNAC for initial assessment, it is not the most appropriate next step at this stage.

      },
      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Correct answer: C) Hemangioma Explanation: Hemangiomas are the most common benign vascular tumours seen in infants and young children. They often develop within the first few weeks of life and are the most frequent vascular lesions in early childhood. While many hemangiomas regress on their own, some may need treatment due to complications such as breathing difficulties or vision problems. Pleomorphic adenoma (Option A): This is the most prevalent benign tumour in the salivary glands of adults. It typically affects the parotid gland and contains a mix of epithelial, myoepithelial, and stromal components. Although benign, it can become malignant over time, particularly carcinoma, eg., pleomorphic adenoma. Mucoepidermoid carcinoma (Option B): This malignant tumour is the most common type of salivary gland cancer, especially in children and young adults. It consists of a mix of mucin-producing, intermediate, and squamoid cells, and occurs in the parotid gland. Adenoid cystic carcinoma (Option D): This is a slow-growing malignant tumour of the salivary glands, more often diagnosed in adults during their 50s. It has a notable tendency to invade nerves and is characterized by late distant metastases. Adenoid cystic carcinoma is the most common malignant tumour of the minor salivary glands, particularly on the palate.

      "explanation": "Correct answer: C) Smoking history Explanation: There is a strong association between smoking and the development of Warthin's tumours. Studies indicate that smokers have up to an 8-fold increased risk of developing this type of tumour compared to non-smokers. Risk factors of salivary gland tumours: Smoking - increases the risk of Warthin’s tumour (Option C) . Radiation exposure - increases the risk of mucoepidermoid CA (Option A ruled out) . Viral infections (EBV, mumps). Recurrent & chronic inflammation, eg. chronic Sialadenitis (Option B ruled out) . Sex - More common in females. Environment - Nickel, rubber industries, hair dye.
