      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: B) Pulmonary Hamartoma Explanation: Pulmonary hamartomas are the most common benign lung tumours and are characterized by a peripheral, sharply demarcated, lobulated mass with a “popcorn” appearance on X-ray. They often consist of normal tissue elements like cartilage in an abnormal location and are commonly found in patients aged 40 to 60 years. PULMONARY HAMARTOMA Characteristics Most frequent benign tumour of the lung. Consist of normal tissue elements containing mesothelial and endothelial elements in an abnormal location; overgrowth of cartilage. Age & Sex 40 to 60 years. More common in males. Location Usually peripheral and slow-growing. Imaging Findings CXR shows a 2 to 3-cm mass that is sharply demarcated and lobulated; Usually not calcified “Popcorn” appearance is characteristic Treatment Excision of the lesion Related Conditions Cystic adenomatoid malformation in infants may represent adenomatous hamartomas (Option D ruled out) Pancoast tumours (Option A) are peripheral lung carcinomas at the lung apex that invade nearby structures like the brachial plexus and sympathetic chain. They typically cause severe upper chest/arm pain and weakness, which this patient does not have. Lung Abscess(Option C) often presents with acute or recurrent fever, cough with pleuritic pain, and hemoptysis with foul-smelling sputum. Chest X-ray typically reveals a localized opacity with smooth margins and fluid level. The “popcorn” appearance is not associated with abscesses.",

      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: C) Small Cell Carcinoma Explanation: Small cell carcinoma is a highly malignant and aggressive type of lung cancer, not considered a bronchial adenoma. It has a different origin and clinical behaviour compared to bronchial adenomas. BRONCHIAL ADENOMA Definition Tumours arising from bronchial epithelium or glands are less aggressive than typical lung cancers. Types Carcinoids (85%): Low-grade, typical and atypical variants. (Option B ruled out) Adenoid Cystic Carcinoma (ACC): Slow-growing, 10% of adenomas. (Option A ruled out) Mucous Gland Adenomas: Benign, arise from mucous glands. Mucoepidermoid Carcinomas: 1-5% of adenomas, varying malignancy. (Option D ruled out) Symptoms Central Lesions: Dyspnea, stridor, wheezing, cough, hemoptysis, recurrent infections. Peripheral Lesions: Often asymptomatic, may be discovered incidentally. Diagnostic Tests Chest X-ray: Detects nodules or masses, central lesions best seen with an oblique view CT Scan: Assesses tumor size, location, lymph node spread Bronchoscopy: Visualizes airways, allows biopsy MRI: Used when CT is unclear Octreotide Nuclear Scan: Detects carcinoid tumors, metastasis sites CT-Guided Fine-Needle Aspiration: For peripheral nodules Treatment Surgical Resection: Main treatment Bronchoscopic Surgery: For small tumours; higher bleeding risk. Open Lung Surgery/VATS: Preferred for complete removal, maximal parenchymal preservation Laser Ablation: Not recommended as primary treatment, used for recurrent tumours. Prognosis The 5-year survival rate is 96% following complete surgical resection.

Explanation: This IHC profile is consistent with malignant mesothelioma. The combination of EPD, a lung-preserving surgery, with chemotherapy is an appropriate and effective treatment approach, aiming to achieve complete macroscopic resection and improve survival. MALIGNANT MESOTHELIOMA About Highly aggressive malignancy originating from pleural mesothelial cells, strongly linked to asbestos. The most common primary pleural tumour. Diagnosis Imaging : CXR, CT, MRI, FDG-PET: Assess tumour invasion and metastasis ECG: Checks for cardiac involvement Biopsy : Pleural Biopsy: Via thoracoscopy, thoracentesis, or open techniques. Immunhistochemistry findings: Diagnosis Mesothelioma Adenocarcinoma Carcinoembryonic Antigen (CEA) Negative Positive (Options A & C ruled out) Vimentin Positive Negative (Option D ruled out) Low Molecular Weight Cytokines Positive Negative Electron Microscopy Long, sinuous villi Short, straight villi with fuzzy glycocalyx Staging : Based on tumour invasion (T), lymph node involvement (N), and metastasis (M). Treatment Multimodality Therapy: Early-stage: Surgery (EPP or EPD) with cisplatin-based chemotherapy and radiotherapy. Advanced Disease: Chemotherapy may extend survival but not cure. Palliative Care: Pleural catheters, pleurodesis. Surgical Options: Extrapleural Pneumonectomy (EPP): Complete lung resection; higher risk but more extensive. Extended Pleurectomy and Decortication (EPD): Lung-preserving, safer, preferred in many centres. Prognosis Median survival is 24–36 months depending on stage and treatment.

      "explanation": "Correct Answer: C) Adenocarcinoma Explanation: Adenocarcinoma is the most common histological type of lung cancer, particularly in non-smokers and women. It accounts for around 45% of all lung cancers It originates in the peripheral parts of the lungs and is a subtype of non-small cell lung carcinoma. While it is associated with various risk factors, including smoking, it also frequently occurs in non-smokers. \\ Risk factors of Lung Cancer Small cell lung carcinoma (Option A) is a type of lung cancer that is more aggressive and often associated with smoking. However, it is not the most common type of lung neoplasm. Bronchogenic carcinoma (Option B) is a broad term used to describe any lung cancer originating in the bronchi or lung parenchyma. However, adenocarcinoma is the most common specific type of lung cancer. Squamous cell carcinoma (Option D) is also linked to smoking and occurs in the central parts of the lungs. While it is a common type of lung cancer, it is less prevalent than adenocarcinoma.",

      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: B) Squamous Cell Carcinoma (SCC) Explanation: Squamous Cell Carcinoma (SCC) is strongly associated with smoking and is commonly located centrally in the lungs. It can compress surrounding structures, leading to symptoms like hoarseness (due to recurrent laryngeal nerve involvement) and superior vena cava syndrome, making this the most likely diagnosis. Type of Lung Cancer Key Features Tumor Location Adenocarcinoma (Option A ruled out) Most common histologic type (45% of lung cancers). Early metastasis, CNS involvement, mucin production, glandular differentiation Peripheral Squamous Cell Carcinoma (SCC) Associated with smoking (90% of cases). Keratinization, intercellular bridges, central necrosis & cavitation. Central Large Cell Carcinoma (Option C ruled out) Highly aggressive Undifferentiated, lacks specific features. Slow-growing, but highly vascular. Peripheral Small Cell Neuroendocrine Tumors Highly aggressive Early metastasis to lymph node, Neuroendocrine origin Central Typical/Atypical Carcinoids Typical Carcinoids- Indolent growth Atypical Carcinoids- Aggressive growth Varies Apical (Pancoast's Tumors) (Option D ruled out) Invades brachial plexus Causes severe localized pain. Pancoast’s syndrome Apical (Upper Lung) Clinical Features: Cough: Common but non-specific. Hemoptysis: Less than 50% of initial presentations. Chest Pain: Severe pain suggests chest wall or intercostal nerve invasion. Dyspnoea (Breathlessness): Loss of lung function, lymphatic invasion, or pleural effusion. Pleural Fluid: Blood in pleural fluid suggests pleural invasion. Clubbing/Hypertrophic Osteoarthropathy : Occasional, may resolve post-surgery. Mediastinal Invasion : Hoarseness (recurrent laryngeal nerve involvement), dysphagia, superior vena cava obstruction. Pancoast's Syndrome : Brachial plexus involvement from apical invasion.

      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: B) Brain Explanation: The Brain is the most common site of metastasis for lung cancer , with approximately 47% of patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) showing brain involvement. This high prevalence is due to the vascular nature of the brain and the tendency of lung cancer cells to spread hematogenously. The most common site of metastasis in Ca lung is the brain Brain > bone > liver > adrenal glands > distant lymph nodes Ca lung is the most common primary for metastasis to: (Pneumonic- KEPABS) K– Kidney E– Esophagus P– Pancreas A– Adrenal B– Brain S– Skin The liver (Option A) is a common site for metastasis from various cancers, including lung cancer, but it is not the most frequent site for lung cancer metastasis. Studies indicate that liver metastases occur in about 22% of lung cancer cases. Adrenal Glands (Option C) metastasis is relatively common, occurring in about 15% of lung cancer cases. While significant, it ranks lower than brain metastases. Bone (Option D) metastases are also common in lung cancer, affecting around 36% of patients.

        "D": "Vitamin K Antagonists"
      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Correct answer: B) Thrombolytic Therapy Explanation: Thrombolytics are the treatment of choice for patients with massive PE who are experiencing severe circulatory compromise (e.g., hypotension, shock). These medications help break down the clot quickly, reducing the risk of further complications and improving blood flow. Eg. Streptokinasse- 6 lakh units can be given initially Management: Anticoagulants and observation. Patients with severe right heart strain and shortness of breath, following is the treatment: Fibrinolytics Radiologically guided catheter embolectomy Inferior Vena Cava (IVC) Filter (Option A): In the case of a massive PE with hemodynamic instability, the priority is to quickly restore blood flow using thrombolytics or mechanical embolectomy. IVC filters do not treat existing clots and are not the immediate choice for unstable patients. They are typically used for patients who have contraindications to anticoagulation therapy or for those with recurrent PEs despite adequate anticoagulation. Ventilator Support (Option C): While important for managing respiratory failure, ventilator support does not directly address the underlying cause of the embolism. Thrombolytics or surgical intervention is needed to treat the clot. Vitamin K Antagonists (Option D): Vitamin K antagonists are not used for the immediate treatment of a massive PE. Their effect is not rapid enough to be effective in the acute setting of a hemodynamically unstable patient.

      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: B) Chemoradiation followed by maintenance immunotherapy Explanation : For stage IIIB lung cancer, which involves significant mediastinal lymph node involvement but not distant metastasis, the standard treatment approach is combined chemoradiation. This is followed by maintenance immunotherapy to improve outcomes and manage residual disease. Investigations for CA Lung Imaging: Chest X-ray (CXR) and CT Scan: Initial imaging to evaluate the presence of a solitary pulmonary nodule (SPN) and assess the extent of lung involvement. PET-CT: Used to further characterize the SPN and assist in staging. Tissue Biopsy: Diagnostic Bronchoscopy: Often chosen for centrally located tumours to obtain a histologic diagnosis. Pleural Fluid Sampling: Thoracentesis: Required for cytologic examination in patients with pleural effusion to determine if it is malignant or reactive. Bronchoscopy (Pre-surgery): To evaluate endobronchial anatomy, exclude secondary endobronchial tumours, and determine the feasibility of complete resection (R0) in central tumours. Fine-Needle Aspiration/Biopsy: To confirm N3 disease if palpable hard lymph nodes are present. Treatment of CA lung Stage IA: Surgical resection only. No chemotherapy. Stage IB: Surgical resection Adjuvant chemotherapy if the tumour is greater than 4 cm. (Option A ruled out ) Stage IIA & IIB: Surgery followed by adjuvant chemotherapy; lobectomy is preferred. Stage IIIA (minimal N2 involvement): Chemoradiation or surgery followed by adjuvant chemotherapy. Stage IIIB: Combined chemoradiation followed by maintenance immunotherapy for 1 year. Stage IV: Systemic therapy with palliative radiation (Option C ruled out) including targeted therapy or immunotherapy based on mutation status. Adjuvant chemotherapy alone (Option D) is typically used after surgical resection in earlier-stage NSCLC (e.g., stage I, II, or IIIA) to eliminate any remaining cancer cells. It is not appropriate as a standalone treatment for stage IIIB disease, where chemoradiation or combined modalities are more effective. Reference: Sabiston textbook of Surgery 21st edition Pg 1596.

        "D": "Horner's syndrome"
      },
      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: C) Superior vena cava syndrome Explanation: Squamous cell carcinoma of the lung often presents with central tumours that can obstruct the superior vena cava, leading to superior vena cava syndrome. Superior vena cava syndrome (SVCS) is a condition caused by the obstruction of blood flow through the superior vena cava, leading to symptoms like facial swelling, distended neck veins, and upper body oedema. Aspect Adenocarcinoma Squamous Cell Carcinoma (SCC) Characteristics Malignant epithelial tumours with glandular differentiation or mucin production. Includes acinar, papillary, lepidic (bronchioloalveolar), and solid with mucin patterns, or a combination of these. Malignant epithelial tumour showing keratinization and/or intercellular bridges. Undergoes central necrosis and cavitation Prevalence The most frequent lung cancer type, accounting for approximately 45% of cases. Occurs in approximately 30% of lung cancer patients; over 90% are cigarette smokers. Clinical features Clubbing, Acanthosis nigricans, thrombophlebitis, scar. Can present as Pancoast tumor, hypercalcemia. Location Predominantly peripheral (75% of cases). Centrally located and tend to expand against the bronchus, causing extrinsic compression. Metastasis Tends to metastasize earlier and more frequently to the central nervous system compared to SCC. Tends to metastasize later than adenocarcinoma. Management Management involves anatomic resection for solitary tumours and a combination of surgical resection, ablation, and radiation for multifocal cases. Anatomical resection with a combination of chemoradiotherapy. Pleural effusion causing dyspnea (Option A): While pleural effusion can occur in lung cancer, it is not specifically associated with SCC's typical central location as prominently as superior vena cava syndrome. Hypercalcemia with renal stones (Option B): Hypercalcemia can be seen in SCC due to paraneoplastic syndromes, but renal stones are not a specific or primary presentation related to the tumour’s central location. Horner's syndrome (Option D) is more commonly associated with Pancoast tumours (a type of lung cancer affecting the apex of the lung), not the centrally located squamous cell carcinoma.",

      "correct_answer": "D",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: D) MRI Explanation: Given the symptoms, a Pancoast tumour is suspected, which may invade soft tissues like the brachial plexus and sympathetic chain. MRI is ideal for assessing the involvement of these structures. Pancoast Tumour Also known as Superior Sulcus Tumour, is a rare peripheral lung carcinoma originating from the apex of the lung, accounting for 5% of lung cancers. Invades the brachial plexus, sympathetic chain, upper ribs, and vertebrae. Symptoms: Intractable upper chest and arm pain, arm weakness. Presentations: Pancoast's Syndrome: Lower brachial plexus palsy, Horner's syndrome, rib erosion, and apical shadow on imaging. Horner's Syndrome: Characterized by miosis, enophthalmos, anhidrosis, ptosis, and loss of spino-ciliary reflex. Investigations: Imaging: Chest X-ray, CT scan, MRI (preferred for visualizing brachial plexus and sympathetic chain involvement). Biopsy: Bronchoscopy with biopsy, CT-guided biopsy. Treatment: Surgery: Lobectomy or pneumonectomy. Radiotherapy Chemotherapy: Methotrexate. Chest X-ray (Option A) can detect a lung mass, but it is not detailed enough to fully evaluate the extent of the tumour or its involvement with surrounding structures. Ultrasound (Option B) is not suitable for evaluating lung masses or bony structures in the chest; it is better suited for soft tissue assessment and fluid-filled areas. CT scan (Option C) provides detailed imaging of the lung mass, including its relationship to the ribs, vertebrae, and surrounding structures, however, MRI would provide additional critical information regarding soft tissue and nerve involvement, which is why it might be considered more appropriate in this specific context.

      "explanation": "Correct Answer: D) Poirier’s Triangle Explanation: By performing left posterolateral thoracotomy, the thoracic duct can be identified in a triangle known as Poirier's triangle THORACIC DUCT Anatomical Course : The thoracic duct passes through the aortic orifice of the diaphragm (T12), runs medial to the azygos vein and right of the aorta in the posterior mediastinum, and crosses to the left side behind the oesophagus at the level of the 7th thoracic vertebra. Tributaries : It receives lymph from several sources including Lateral intercostal nodes, Posterior mediastinal nodes, Left jugular lymph trunk (head and neck), Left subclavian lymph trunk (left upper limb), and Left bronchomediastinal trunk (left thorax). Variations : Although a single termination at the left venous junction is common (77%), the thoracic duct may also have double, triple, or quadruple terminations eg. In the left subclavian vein, left vertebral vein, right internal jugular vein, or right subclavian vein. Dimensions : Length= 45cm, width= 5mm Wider at both ends and narrower in the middle. Simon's triangle (Option A) is defined by the recurrent laryngeal nerve on the anterior side, the common carotid artery on the posterior side, and the inferior thyroid artery forming the base. This triangle is significant because it helps in locating the recurrent laryngeal nerve. Lesgaft's triangle (Option B) or the superior lumbar triangle is bordered by the sacrospinalis muscle, the 12th rib, and the posterior edge of the internal oblique muscle. The triangle of Petit (Option C) or the inferior lumbar triangle is defined by the boundaries of the latissimus dorsi muscle, the external oblique muscle, and the iliac crest.",

      "explanation": "Correct answer: B) Myasthenia gravis Explanation: A mass in the anterior mediastinum is commonly associated with a thymoma . Thymomas are strongly associated with myasthenia gravis (MG). 50% of thymoma patients have MG. The symptoms of muscle weakness, dysarthria, and ptosis that worsen with activity are classic hallmarks of myasthenia gravis (MG). Lambert-Eaton myasthenic syndrome (Option A) is a paraneoplastic syndrome typically associated with small-cell lung cancer, not thymomas. It presents with proximal muscle weakness and autonomic dysfunction, but it is less common than myasthenia gravis in thymoma cases. Cushing syndrome (Option C) is usually associated with ectopic ACTH production from tumours like small-cell lung cancer or adrenal adenomas, not thymomas. Syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone (Option D) is another paraneoplastic syndrome more commonly linked with small cell lung cancer, leading to hyponatremia, rather than thymomas.

      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Correct answer: C) Contrast-enhanced CT scan Explanation: A contrast-enhanced CT scan is the next best step for evaluating a thymoma. It provides detailed imaging, assessing the tumour's relationship with surrounding structures and helping to determine the extent of the disease. Clinical features Mostly asymptomatic (small tumor), incidentally detected. It may compress the trachea (dyspnea), esophagus (dysphagia), recurrent laryngeal nerve (dysphonia or hoarseness of voice), and superior vena cava (superior vena cava syndrome). Investigations: CT scan: Investigation of choice Determine the extent of the disease. Histology (definitive diagnosis) Noninvasive thymomas: Medullary-type epithelial cells (elongated or spindle-shaped) or a mixture of medullary- and cortical-type epithelial cells (admixture of polygonal cortical-type epithelial cells and a denser infiltrate of thymocytes). Invasive thymoma: Cytologically benign but locally invasive. The epithelial cells are with abundant cytoplasm and rounded vesicular nuclei, mixed with numerous thymocytes. Cytokeratin (marker to distinguish thymoma from lymphoma, thymomas are positive for cytokeratin) Serum markers (Option A) are not typically used to evaluate an anterior mediastinal mass suspected to be a thymoma. They are generally used to differentiate between seminimatous & non-seminimatous germ cell tumours based on the AFP levels. Chest X-ray with a lateral view (Option B): While a lateral chest X-ray can help localize the mass within the mediastinum, it is not as informative as a CT scan. A lateral view could provide some additional information, but a CT scan is superior in detailing the characteristics and extent of the mass. Pulmonary function tests (Option D) are important in assessing lung function, particularly before surgery, but they do not provide specific information about the thymoma itself. They are useful in surgical planning rather than in the initial evaluation.",

      },
      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "Correct answer: A) Complete surgical resection Explanation: Complete surgical resection of the tumour is the most appropriate treatment plan for a Stage III thymoma with invasion into nearby structures. Surgical resection may include removing and r econstructing the involved structures, such as the pericardium and superior vena cava. For optimising patient care, a multidisciplinary approach with chemotherapy, neoadjuvant chemotherapy, radiotherapy and immunotherapy is usually undertaken after resection and reconstruction to prevent disease recurrence. The Masaoka-Koga system is based on surgical findings and describes the extent of tumour spread. It categorizes thymomas into stages I-IV, with higher stages indicating more extensive disease. Masaoka-Koga Staging System Stage I The tumour is completely encapsulated, meaning it is confined within the thymus gland and has not spread beyond its capsule. Stage II The tumour has spread beyond the capsule of the thymus. Microscopic or macroscopic invasion into the surrounding fatty tissue or mediastinal pleura. Stage III The tumour has spread to adjacent organs in the chest, such as the pericardium, the lungs, or the great vessels (aorta, vena cava, pulmonary artery). Stage IV The tumour has spread to distant sites in the body. Stage IVa : Spread to the pericardium or pleura Stage IVb : Spread to distant organs through the bloodstream or lymphatic system. Radiation therapy alone (Option B) is generally not sufficient for a Stage III thymoma, especially one that has invaded surrounding structures. It is typically used as an adjunctive treatment after surgery or as palliative therapy in inoperable cases. Observation and periodic follow-up imaging (Option C) is not an appropriate treatment strategy for a Stage III thymoma. This approach might be suitable for small, asymptomatic, and non-invasive thymomas, but not for advanced-stage tumors. Chemotherapy as a primary treatment without surgery (Option D): While chemotherapy can be used as a primary treatment for patients who are not candidates for surgery, this patient has no contraindications to surgery and would benefit from the curative option of surgical resection following chemotherapy.

      "explanation": "Correct answer: C) Chronic fibrous mediastinitis Explanation: The patient’s history of pulmonary tuberculosis, along with imaging findings showing fibrosis and compression of the SVC and oesophagus, strongly suggest chronic fibrous mediastinitis. Chronic fibrous mediastinitis is a rare disorder characterized by extensive fibrotic tissue formation in the mediastinum. This fibrosis can compress vital mediastinal structures such as the SVC, oesophagus, trachea, and pulmonary arteries, leading to symptoms like shortness of breath, facial swelling, and dysphagia. The condition often follows a history of granulomatous infections such as tuberculosis or histoplasmosis, which provoke a chronic inflammatory response in the mediastinum. Superior vena cava syndrome (Option A): This is a condition where the SVC is obstructed, leading to symptoms like facial swelling and difficulty swallowing but there is no associated mediastinal fibrosis. It is not the primary diagnosis. Pulmonary embolism (Option B): This condition causes sudden shortness of breath and chest pain but does not typically cause facial swelling or difficulty swallowing. There is also no associated mediastinal fibrosis. Thymoma (Option D) is a tumour that occurs in the anterior mediastinum. It can cause compression of mediastinal structures but is less likely to be associated with a history of granulomatous infection and extensive fibrosis.

Chest X-ray of Pneumothorax CT of Pneumothorax Chylothorax (Option C): Chylothorax is caused by the accumulation of chyle (a milky fluid rich in triglycerides, chylomicrons, and white blood cells) in the pleural space due to disruption of the thoracic duct. It is associated with dyspnea and cough, but the pleural fluid is typically milky or clear. This patient’s presentation of sudden chest pain and respiratory distress with a history of COPD is more indicative of SSP rather than chylothorax.

Applying a sterile occlusive dressing, taped on three sides, helps to seal the wound and prevent air from being drawn into the pleural space with each breath, which can help stabilize the patient and prevent progression to a tension pneumothorax. OPEN PNEUMOTHORAX Pathophysiology Large defect in the chest wall (>3 cm). Intrathoracic pressure = Atmospheric pressure. If the size of the defect > 2/3rds of the trachea’s diameter, the air is drawn through the wound rather than the trachea, leading to air accumulation in the hemithorax, hypoventilation, and hypoxia. Initial Management Seal the Defect with a sterile occlusive plastic dressing (e.g., OPSITE™) taped on three sides to create a flutter valve. Chest Tube Placement: Insert a chest tube as soon as possible at a site distant from the injury. Potential Complications Tension Pneumothorax if the defect creates a one-way valve effect.

This life-threatening condition requires immediate needle thoracocentesis to relieve the pressure. Once stable, a chest tube should be inserted. TENSION PNEUMOTHORAX Pathophysiology D/t ‘one-way valve’ air leaks from the lung or chest wall. Air is sucked into the thoracic cavity without any escape, collapsing and compressing the affected lung. The mediastinum shifts to the opposite side, reducing venous return and compressing the opposite lung, leading to decreased cardiac output and function. This can result in sudden death.

Clinical Features Tachypnea and Tachycardia Hyper-resonance and Decreased/Absent Breath Sounds Resonant Percussion with severe mediastinal/tracheal shift Cyanosis and Hypotension Chest Pain Distended Neck Veins Emergency Management Tension pneumothorax is a clinical diagnosis and treatment should never be delayed by waiting for radiological confirmation. Immediate Thoracocentesis (needle): Wide bore needle (typically a 20- or 22-gauge) in the 5nd intercostal space in the safety triangle. Decompression should be performed in the \"safe triangle.\" Safe Triangle Boundaries : Posterior: Latissimus dorsi Anterior: Lateral border of the pectoralis major Inferior: A line drawn perpendicularly from the nipple to the back, just anterior to the mid-axillary line. In critical situations, a finger thoracostomy can be done in the same location. Nasal Oxygen for support. Intercostal Tube Placement (ICT) once stable and confirmed by chest X-ray. Additional Care Antibiotics and analgesics for treatment. Ventilator Support with IPPV in severe cases. Order an urgent chest X-ray to confirm the diagnosis (Option A): While a chest X-ray can confirm the diagnosis of tension pneumothorax, it should not delay immediate treatment. Tension pneumothorax is a clinical diagnosis and requires urgent intervention without waiting for imaging confirmation. Insert a chest tube into the 5th intercostal space in the anterior axillary line (Option C): Chest tube insertion is an important step after initial decompression but is not the first intervention. Needle thoracocentesis is performed first to immediately relieve the pressure. Perform a finger thoracostomy in the safe triangle (Option D): A finger thoracostomy may be performed",

Examination reveals right-sided dullness and diminished breath sounds. A CXR shows a large pleural effusion, and thoracentesis drains 1000ml of blood. What is the most appropriate next step in management?",

      "correct_answer": "D",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: D) Intercostal chest tube (ICT) placement Explanation: Given the significant blood in the pleural cavity (hemothorax) and the patient’s hemodynamic instability, ICT placement is necessary to evacuate the blood, relieve pressure on the lung, and stabilize the patient before considering further surgical intervention if needed. HEMOTHORAX Definition The presence of blood in the pleural cavity, causes irritation, pain, and potential shock. Causes Trauma (e.g., rib fractures) Postoperative complications (e.g., lung, cardiac, esophageal surgeries) Tumours (lung, mediastinum, pleura) Leaking aneurysms Clinical Features Chest pain and tenderness Dyspnea Dullness on percussion Diminished breath sounds Signs of shock Investigations Chest X-ray Aspiration (pleural tap) Chest CT scan Treatment Intercostal chest tube (ICT) placement in the mid-axillary line in the 5th intercostal space. Antibiotics and bronchodilators Thoracotomy if persistent or large blood loss Criteria for Thoracotomy: >1.5 L blood lost in last 1 hour (or) >200cc/hour over next 2-4 hours Complications Infection and empyema Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) Observation and follow-up with chest X-ray (Option A): Observation is inappropriate in this case due to the large blood volume in the pleural cavity and the patient’s hemodynamic instability. Immediate intervention is required to address the underlying issue. Administration of antibiotics and bronchodilators only (Option B): While antibiotics and bronchodilators may be necessary adjuncts to prevent infection and improve lung function, they are not sufficient for the initial management of a large hemothorax. Thoracotomy with evacuation and lung decortication (Option C): Thoracotomy is usually reserved for cases where there is initial chest tube output of 1500 ml of blood or persistent bleeding (over 200-300 mL/hr) or clotted hemothorax that cannot be managed with chest tube drainage alone. Although this might be considered later, the initial step should be ICT placement.",

      },
      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: C) Oral diet with medium-chain triglycerides Explanation: Oral diet with medium-chain triglycerides (option C) is the appropriate first-line management for postoperative chylothorax . MCTs are absorbed directly into the portal venous system, bypassing the lymphatic channels, and thus reduce the chyle leak. Initial conservative treatment includes: MCT-based oral diet or NPO with TPN Chest tube drainage Somatostatin or octreotide Monitoring of output volume Chylothorax It is the accumulation of lymph in the pleural cavity. It is common on the right side because of the long course of the thoracic duct towards the right side. Causes: Injury due to trauma/surgeries in the neck or chest. Surgical trauma is the most common cause- may be oesophageal surgeries, pneumonectomy, cervical sympathectomy, neck dissections, or aortic surgeries. Tuberculosis, lymphoma, or secondaries in the mediastinum. Carcinoma lung or oesophagus. Clinical Features: Symptoms: Chest pain, dyspnea, and pleural effusion. Complications: Protein loss and malnutrition. Diagnostic Findings: Pleural tap shows chalky white fluid rich in chylomicrons with triglyceride levels exceeding 110 mg/dL. Chest X-ray and CT chest are used for further assessment. Management: Initial Treatment: Intercostal tube (ICT) drainage, oral diet with medium-chain triglycerides, and total parenteral nutrition (TPN) to bypass the lymphatic system. Done before surgical repair via thoracoscopy Antibiotics: Administered to treat the underlying cause. Surgical Intervention: Thoracic duct ligation, particularly for traumatic or iatrogenic cases. If the leak persists beyond one week, a thoracoscopic approach is recommended to identify and ligate the thoracic duct above and below the leak. Advanced Treatment: Pleurodesis with agents like bleomycin, talc, tetracycline, or pleural stripping for refractory cases. Oral antibiotics (Option A): is incorrect because there is no evidence of infection or empyema. Antibiotics are not routinely used in sterile chylous effusion. Thoracic duct ligation via thoracoscopy (Option B): is incorrect at this stage. It is a second-line intervention , reserved for persistent high-output leaks (>1,000 mL/day for 5–7 days) or failure of conservative treatment. Immediate pleurodesis with talc (Option D): is incorrect because pleurodesis is considered only in refractory or inoperable cases , not as a first-line treatment.

      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: B) Filarial infection Explanation: Filarial infection is the most common cause of chyluria, as it can obstruct intestinal lymphatics, leading to lymph leakage into the urine. Chyluria Passage of milky white chylous urine, aggravated after fatty meals. Causes: Most Common: Filarial infections (2% of cases). Other Causes: Tumors, tuberculosis, malaria, and ascariasis infestation. Mechanism: Obstruction of intestinal lymphatic vessels leads to high lymphatic pressure, causing lymph to enter the renal lymphatics, or rupture of intestinal lymphatics into the renal pelvis/ureter, forming a lympho-urinary fistula. Clinical Features: Symptoms mimic bacterial or tuberculous pyuria and may include urinary infections and protein loss. Possible presentation of colic due to lymph clots in the urinary system. Diagnostic Tools: Urine study, culture, intravenous urogram (IVU), lymphangiography, and abdominal ultrasound. Management: Dietary changes (low-fat, protein-rich diet). Antibiotics and diethylcarbamazine (DEC). Increase oral fluid intake. Surgical options include ligation of dilated lymphatics or sclerosing lymph vessels. Renal stone disease (Option A): While renal stones can cause urinary symptoms, they do not typically lead to chyluria or milky white urine. Tuberculosis (Option C): Although tuberculosis can cause urinary symptoms, it is not the most common cause of chyluria compared to filarial infections & also the history is not pointing towards TB. Diabetes mellitus (Option D) can lead to various urinary symptoms but is not associated with the development of chyluria.

      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Correct answer: B) Lung cancer Explanation: The high protein and LDH ratios, along with the elevated LDH level, are consistent with a pleural effusion due to exudative cause. Lung cancer is a common cause of exudative pleural effusions, which meet Light’s criteria for exudates. Transudative effusions result from an imbalance in hydrostatic or oncotic pressure, leading to protein-poor, clear or straw-coloured fluid. Exudative effusions stem from inflammation or increased capillary permeability, producing protein-rich, often turbid, bloody, or purulent fluid. Light's criteria for exudative effusions Pleural fluid protein to serum protein ratio > 0.5 Pleural fluid LDH to serum LDH ratio > 0.6 Pleural fluid LDH level > 2/3 of the upper limit of normal for serum LDH Causes of Pleural Effusion Transudative Exudative Congestive heart failure Cirrhosis Nephrotic syndrome Superior vena cava obstruction Pulmonary embolism Sarcoidosis Hypoalbuminemia Fluid retention/overload Lobar collapse Meigs syndrome Malignant: Lung cancer Lymphoma Mesothelioma Metastatic cancers Infectious: Bacterial pneumonia/empyema Tuberculosis Fungal infections Viral infections Parasitic infections Collagen Vascular Disease-related: Rheumatoid arthritis Wegener granulomatosis Systemic lupus erythematosus Churg-Strauss syndrome Abdominal/Gastrointestinal disease-related: Esophageal perforation Subphrenic abscess Pancreatitis/pancreatic pseudocyst Meigs syndrome Other Causes: Pulmonary embolism with infarction Coronary artery bypass grafting Radiation/trauma Dressler syndrome Asbestosis After lung transplantation After bone marrow transplantation Drug-induced Uremia Congestive heart failure (Option A): Typically associated with transudative effusions, which are low in protein and LDH. This patient's pleural fluid analysis suggests an exudative effusion, making this option less likely. Nephrotic syndrome (Option C): Usually causes transudative effusions due to low protein levels. This effusion has a higher protein content, making this option unlikely. Cirrhosis (Option D): Also commonly leads to transudative effusions due to low oncotic pressure from hypoalbuminemia. The characteristics of this effusion align more with an exudative process.",

      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Correct answer: C) Insert a chest tube for drainage Explanation: The Chest X-ray shows massive amounts of fluid in the right lung and a characteristic Ellis S-shaped curve. Based on investigatory findings & the Light’s criteria, this patient is having exudative pleural effusion. Inserting a chest tube is the most appropriate next step for this patient, as it directly addresses the symptoms of dyspnea and chest pain by removing the excess fluid. The high protein content and elevated LDH levels indicate an exudative effusion, likely caused by inflammation or malignancy, which needs to be drained. The Ellis S-shaped curve on the chest X-ray further supports the presence of a large effusion that is causing significant lung compression. By draining the fluid, the patient’s respiratory symptoms can be alleviated, and further diagnostic testing can be performed if needed. Initiate diuretic therapy (Option A): Diuretics are typically used to manage pleural effusions associated with heart failure or fluid overload. However, given the evidence of a large effusion and the elevated protein and LDH levels, indicating an exudative process, diuretics alone would not be sufficient. Perform a pleural biopsy (Option B): Although a pleural biopsy might be indicated if malignancy is suspected, the immediate concern is to relieve the patient's symptoms by draining the effusion. A biopsy can be considered later if needed. Administer antibiotics (Option D): Antibiotics are necessary if there is evidence of an infectious process, such as pneumonia.

      "explanation": "Correct answer: A) Prolonged immobility Explanation: The patient's prolonged bed rest following hip replacement surgery is the most likely contributing factor to his condition. The patient’s symptoms of sudden dyspnea, chest pain & hemoptysis following prolonged immobilization give rise to the suspicion of a pulmonary embolism. Immobility → DVT → Pulmonary embolism → Clot lodges in pulmonary artery & blocks blood flow to a portion of the lung → Dyspnea & chest pain. Risk factors (for PE): Dehydration (Option B): While dehydration could potentially contribute to clot formation, the primary risk factor in this scenario is the prolonged immobility associated with postoperative bed rest, making it a more significant factor for developing a pulmonary embolism. High blood pressure (Option C) is not directly associated with an increased risk of pulmonary embolism. The patient’s symptoms and recent surgery-related immobility are more indicative of a thromboembolic event rather than issues related to hypertension. Recent blood transfusion (Option D): Although blood transfusions can have various complications, they are not commonly associated with an increased risk of pulmonary embolism. The key risk factor here is the patient’s prolonged immobility after hip surgery.",

      "correct_answer": "D",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: D) CT Pulmonary Angiography (CTPA) Explanation: CTPA is widely accepted as the gold standard investigation for diagnosing pulmonary embolism due to its high accuracy, speed, and ability to provide comprehensive diagnostic information. It is the preferred test in most clinical scenarios when PE is suspected. Investigations: Multidetector CT (MDCT): Investigation of choice (best investigation) CTPA (CT pulmonary angiography): Gold standard CT pulmonary angiography shows the presence of a saddle embolus and substantial thrombus burden in the lobar branches of both main pulmonary arteries. ECG findings: Sinus tachycardia (Most specific finding) S1Q3T3 (most specific finding) Doppler Ultrasound (Option A) is primarily used to assess the risk of PE by looking for DVT in the legs but does not serve as a direct diagnostic tool for PE. Therefore, it is not considered the gold standard for diagnosing pulmonary embolism. Chest X-ray (Option B): While useful for ruling out other conditions, a chest X-ray cannot directly identify a pulmonary embolism. Findings suggestive of PE, such as the Westermark sign or Hampton's hump, are rare and not always conclusive. The Westermark sign is characterized by a focal area of hyperlucency on chest radiographs, caused by oligemia distal to a pulmonary artery obstruction, often indicating a pulmonary embolism. Hampton’s hump is seen as a wedge-shaped opacity on the radiograph, typically located at the lung periphery, suggesting pulmonary infarction. Ventilation-Perfusion (V/Q) Lung Scan (Option C): Despite being a valuable diagnostic tool, the V/Q scan is less specific and sensitive compared to CT pulmonary angiography. Its results often need confirmation by additional testing. Modified Well’s Criteria It is a scoring system to determine the likelihood of PE and thromboembolic events. Features Score Symptoms and signs of DVT 3 PE more likely than an alternate diagnosis 3 Heart rate >100 bpm 1.5 Recent immobilization or surgery (<4 weeks) 1.5 Previous PE or DVT 1.5 Hemoptysis 1 Active Cancer 1 Score: >4 - PE likely ; </= 4 - PE unlikely",
