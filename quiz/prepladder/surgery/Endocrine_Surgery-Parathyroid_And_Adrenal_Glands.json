      "question": "A 45-year-old woman presents with a large adrenal mass discovered incidentally on imaging. The tumor measures 12 cm and shows irregular borders with central necrosis. She exhibits symptoms of Cushing syndrome. What is the most likely diagnosis for this adrenal mass?",
      "options": {
        "A": "Benign Cortical Adenoma",
        "B": "Adrenal Myelolipoma",
        "C": "Adrenocortical Carcinoma",
        "D": "Aldosterone-Producing Adenoma"
      },
      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: C) Adrenocortical Carcinoma Explanation: Adrenocortical Carcinoma: Characterized by large tumor size (typically >9 cm), irregular borders, and the presence of central necrosis, which matches the clinical scenario. The tumor's association with symptoms of Cushing syndrome further supports this diagnosis. Adrenocortical carcinoma often presents with hormone overproduction and significant local invasion or metastases. Adrenocortical Carcinoma: Rare; Typically large at diagnosis (mean size 9–13 cm). Often spreads beyond the adrenal gland. 5-year survival rates: 15%-20% overall; ~40% with surgical resection. Over 50% are functional, producing hormones. Common presentations include Cushing syndrome (M/C) and virilization. Radiographic Features: Adrenocortical tumor arises from the retroperitoneum. Whenever there is a retroperitoneal mass or pathology involved, the IOC is CECT. CT shows a heterogeneous mass with irregular borders, central necrosis, and invasion of adjacent structures. Possible metastases to lymph nodes, liver, and lungs. Treatment Surgical Management Radical en bloc resection of adjacent organs or regional lymphadenectomy. Right-sided tumors >9 cm may extend into IVC or heart Drugs given to control steroid hypersecretion K: Ketoconazole A: Aminoglutethimide M: Metyrapone Chemotherapy Mitotane is used as adjuvant therapy or for unresectable/metastatic disease but has significant GI and neurologic toxicity. FIRM-ACT Trial showed that etoposide, doxorubicin, cisplatin, and mitotane improved response rates and progression-free survival. Option A - Benign Cortical Adenoma: Typically <4 cm, smooth borders, and <10 HU on CT. Likely to cause Cushing syndrome but does not present with central necrosis or significant irregularities in imaging. Option B - Adrenal Myelolipoma: Composed of fat and hematopoietic elements. Myelolipomas are usually less than 6 cm and do not cause Cushing syndrome. Option D - Aldosterone-Producing Adenoma : Causes primary hyperaldosteronism, not Cushing syndrome, and usually not this large.",

Malignant Pheochromocytoma Tumors that have undergone metastasis to Lymph-node (or) Distant site ( Biochemically same as Pheochromocytoma) Survival Rate 5-year survival ranges from 20% to 45%. Criteria of Malignancy Malignancy is defined by the development of metastases Common Sites of Metastasis Axial skeleton, lymph nodes, liver, lung, and kidney. (Option A,C,D) Diagnosis MIBG & Gallium Dotate is Best for Diagnosis Biopsy & FNAC are avoided in Malignant Pheochromocytoma Confirmed by the presence of metastases in locations where neuroectodermal tissues are not normally found. This is the primary criterion distinguishing malignant pheochromocytomas from benign ones, as histopathologic features alone are not reliable in predicting malignancy. Histopathologic Criteria No histopathologic criteria can accurately predict the clinical course of malignancy. Primary Treatment Surgical resection, even if not curative, can offer significant palliative benefits by managing mass effects and reducing catecholamine excess.

      },
      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "trimester. Correct Answer: A) Use phenoxybenzamine and plan laparoscopic adrenalectomy in the second trimester. Explanation: For pregnant patients diagnosed with pheochromocytoma, it is essential to initiate α -blockade with phenoxybenzamine to control hypertension and reduce catecholamine excess. Laparoscopic adrenalectomy is typically recommended during the second trimester as it minimizes the risks to both the mother and fetus. Adequate α -blockade has been shown to significantly reduce perioperative mortality, making this approach effective and safe. Additionally, delaying surgical intervention until the third trimester increases the risk of complications associated with uncontrolled pheochromocytoma. While cesarean section and postpartum adrenalectomy may be considered in late pregnancy, they are not appropriate for this patient at 24 weeks gestation. Management of Pheochromocytoma Biochemical Diagnosis Identify pheochromocytoma using biochemical tests and imaging for localization. Preoperative Preparation Start with an α -adrenoceptor blocker like phenoxybenzamine. Adjust the dose to 100-160 mg/day to achieve postural hypotension. Add β -blockers if necessary after α -blockade to manage tachycardia. Other regimens include α -blockade with doxazosin or prazosin, with and without β -blockers, calcium channel blockers alone, and using catecholamine synthesis blocker metyrosine in cardiac failure. Surgery Laparoscopic Adrenalectomy : Preferred for PCC unless tumor >10 cm or malignant signs are present. Open Surgery : Recommended for large tumors or those along the sympathetic chain. Postoperative Care Monitor for hypovolemia and hypoglycemia for 24 hrs post-surgery. Conduct annual biochemical tests for recurrence. Malignant Pheochromocytoma Perform surgical excision , possibly with en bloc resection for invasive tumors. Consider adjuvant therapies like radiolabeled MIBG and octreotide. Pheochromocytoma in Pregnancy First/Second Trimester : Implement α -blockade, then proceed with laparoscopic adrenalectomy. Third Trimester : Plan for an elective C-section followed by adrenalectomy 6 weeks later. Option B: β -blockers (like Labetalol) should not be used alone without a prior α -blockade . Option C : Calcium channel blockers alone are insufficient for managing pheochromocytoma, as they do not address the underlying",

      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: B) Performing a 24-hour urine collection for metanephrines Explanation: Clinical symptoms of paroxysmal hypertension, palpitations, headaches, and sweating in this patient are strongly suggestive of Pheochromocytoma . After a positive plasma-free metanephrine test, the next step is to perform a 24-hour urine collection for metanephrines and catecholamines to confirm the diagnosis of pheochromocytoma. This test has high specificity (up to 99.6%) and helps differentiate pheochromocytoma from other conditions that can cause similar symptoms. It is crucial to confirm the biochemical diagnosis before proceeding with localization imaging. Option A: Metaiodobenzylguanidine (MIBG) scans are specialized imaging studies used for further evaluation, especially in metastatic or multifocal cases, and are not used for initial biochemical confirmation after plasma testing. Option C: The clonidine suppression test differentiates between true pheochromocytoma and other causes of elevated catecholamines. However, it is not typically used as a confirmatory test after a positive plasma metanephrine test. Option D: Imaging studies like CT or MRI are used for localization of the tumor after biochemical confirmation. They are not the next step after a positive plasma test but follow after confirmation through urine testing. Reference: Sabiston Surgery Textbook of Surgery, 21st Edition Page no: 982",

Hereditary Paraganglioma-Pheochromocytoma Syndrome (HPPS) encompasses germline mutations in several genes, including SDH subunits. SDHB mutations are particularly noted for their association with high rates of malignant pheochromocytomas and extra-adrenal tumors. These mutations lead to the accumulation of Krebs cycle intermediates, promoting tumorigenesis.

        "D": "Usually non-vascular and causes minimal clinical symptoms."
      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "palpitations, and sweating. Correct Answer: B) It intermittently releases catecholamines, leading to episodes of headache, palpitations, and sweating. Explanation: Pheochromocytomas cause episodic symptoms due to intermittent bursts of catecholamines, Adrenaline and Noradrenaline , classically resulting in paroxysms of headache, palpitations, and sweating, aligning with the patient's presentation . These episodes are often triggered by various stimuli and are characteristic of pheochromocytomas. Pheochromocytomas are rare tumors arising from chromaffin cells of the adrenal medulla. Pathophysiology of Pheochromocytomas: Catecholamine Production: Tyrosine is converted to dihydroxyphenylalanine (DOPA) by tyrosine hydroxylase, then to dopamine, norepinephrine, and finally epinephrine, with PNMT (phenylethanolamine-N-methyltransferase) catalyzing the final step. Storage: Catecholamines are stored in vesicles and released into circulation. Release: Pheochromocytomas release catecholamines in paroxysmal, continuous, or mixed patterns, leading to persistent hypertension (norepinephrine) or tachyarrhythmias (epinephrine). Epinephrine and Norepinephrine bind to adrenoceptors with varying affinities. Clinical Features: (6P + W) P AIN P ALLOR P ANIC ATTACK P ALPITATIONS P ERSPIRATION P OSTURAL HYPOTENSION W EIGHT LOSS Adrenoceptor Activation: Beta-1 Receptors: Stimulate adenylate cyclase, increasing cAMP (cyclic adenosine monophosphate), which enhances cardiac contractility and conduction. Ryanodine-2 Receptors: Increase calcium release, boosting cardiac contractility. Beta-2 Receptors: Cause vasodilation in peripheral blood vessels. Alpha-1 Receptors: Induce vasoconstriction and hypertension. Alpha-2 Receptors: Inhibit norepinephrine release from nerve terminals. Option A: Pheochromocytomas primarily secrete catecholamines (adrenaline and noradrenaline), not ACTH . The symptoms result from intermittent spikes in catecholamine levels rather than continuous secretion. Option C: Pheochromocytomas are known for causing episodic symptoms rather than chronic, steady symptoms. Option D: Pheochromocytomas are highly vascular and are associated with significant clinical symptoms due to the excessive production of catecholamines. Learning Objective: Pheochromocytomas cause episodic headaches, palpitations, and sweating due to the intermittent release of catecholamines, primarily epinephrine and norepinephrine. Extra-adrenal pheochromocytomas (paragangliomas) secrete norepinephrine, not epinephrine, due to the lack of the enzyme Phenylethanolamine N-methyltransferase .

      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: B) Stimulation of 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D production. Explanation: Parathyroid hormone (PTH) stimulates the production of 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D (active vitamin D) in the kidneys, which enhances intestinal calcium absorption, thereby increasing serum calcium levels. Anatomy and Physiology of Parathyroid Glands: The glands are Portland brick (yellow/brown) in color. There are typically four parathyroid glands & weigh about 30 mg. Located in freely mobile fat over the thyroid capsule Blood Supply: Both superior and inferior parathyroid glands are supplied by the inferior thyroid artery. Drains ipsilaterally via superior, middle, and inferior thyroid veins. Histology : Composed of chief cells and oxyphil cells (water-clear cells). Chief cells produce parathyroid hormone (PTH). Parathyroid Gland Origin Location Inferior Parathyroid Glands Third pharyngeal pouch Varies, but in 50% of cases found at the inferior pole of the thyroid gland. Superior Parathyroid Glands Fourth pharyngeal pouch More constant, typically at the posterior aspect of the thyroid lobe near the cricothyroid junction Role of Parathyroid Glands : Regulate serum calcium levels through parathyroid hormone (PTH). PTH Secretion : Triggered by low calcium or high magnesium levels . Initially cleaved in the liver yielding an active N-terminal fragment, that has a 3-5 minute half-life. PTH Action : Kidneys: Increases serum calcium by increasing resorption from renal tubules (Option A) and by activating 25-hydroxyvitamin D to 1,25-dihydroxy vitamin D (active form). (Option B) Bone : Stimulates osteoblasts and osteoclasts to increase bone turnover , thereby increasing serum calcium. (Option D) GI Tract: Enhances calcium absorption through active vitamin D.

      "question": "A 55-year-old woman undergoes a routine abdominal CT scan for an unrelated issue. The scan reveals a 2.5 cm mass in the left adrenal gland. The patient has no history of adrenal disorders but reports occasional episodes of sweating and palpitations. Her blood pressure is elevated. Based on these findings, what condition should be primarily ruled out in the diagnostic workup?",

        "C": "Pheochromocytoma",
        "D": "Aldosteronoma"
      },
      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: C) Pheochromocytoma Explanation: Pheochromocytoma should be ruled out in patients with adrenal incidentalomas presenting with symptoms such as sweating and palpitations, particularly if the unenhanced CT attenuation is >10 HU. This condition can cause significant cardiovascular complications if left untreated. Adrenal Incidentaloma: Mass >1 cm in the adrenal gland, discovered incidentally during an unrelated medical workup. Benign and Nonfunctioning: >80% of incidentalomas are benign cortical adenomas or other benign lesions. Differential Diagnosis: Nonfunctioning Adenoma: 60% Pheochromocytoma: 9% Cortisol-Producing Adenoma: 5% Aldosteronoma: 5% Adrenocortical Carcinoma: 5% Adrenal Cyst: 5% Ganglioneuroma: 5% Metastatic carcinoma: 2% Myelolipoma: 1% Evaluation of incidentaloma: Imaging All patients with adrenal incidentalomas should be assessed for malignancy based on the size and imaging characteristics of the mass. CT differentiates benign cortical adenoma from adrenal carcinoma or metastasis. FNAC Fine-needle aspiration differentiates adrenal tumors from metastatic tumors. Biopsy is avoided in suspected pheochromocytomas due to the risk of crisis. FNAC is to be done only after ruling out Pheochromocytoma Hormonal Evaluation All patients with adrenal incidentalomas should be assessed for subclinical hormonal hyperfunction. Pheochromocytoma 24-hour urinary fractionated metanephrines, catecholamines, or plasma fractionated metanephrines Subclinical Cushing Syndrome Measure dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate (DHEAS) and perform 1 mg overnight dexamethasone suppression test (DST) Primary Aldosteronism Measure plasma aldosterone and plasma renin activity (if hypertension or hypokalemia is present) Management: The risk of malignancy is directly proportional to the size of the tumor. Hence, surgery is planned in the following cases: Functional Tumors: Surgery is recommended regardless of size. Non-Functioning Tumors: > 5 cm: Surgery recommended due to >25% malignancy risk. 3-5 cm: Strongly consider surgery. Management depends on imaging features, patient age, surgical risk, tumor growth, and patient preference. < 3 cm: Observation with follow-up imaging is appropriate.",

      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: B) En bloc resection Explanation: En-bloc resection involves removing the tumor and any adjacent structures it has invaded as a single mass, which helps reduce the risk of spilling tumor cells and local recurrence. PARATHYROID CARCINOMA Clinical Features Parathyroid carcinoma is responsible for 1% of cases of primary hyperparathyroidism. Age of onset: 44 to 54 years Serum Calcium: >14 mg/dL (Mean 14.6 to 15.9 mg/dL) Serum PTH: 5 to 10 fold higher than normal levels. Neck Mass: Present in 34-52% of patients. Evidence of bone disease, renal disease , or pancreatitis may be present. Diagnosis Suspicion: Elevated serum calcium, high PTH, neck mass, or parathyroid crisis. Pathologic Features: Trabecular pattern, mitotic figures, thick fibrous bands, capsular/vessel invasion. Definitive Diagnosis: Local invasion or metastases. Immunohistochemistry: Parafibromin loss (100% specificity), Ki-67, galectin-3, PGP 9.5. Molecular Markers: Loss of parafibromin , upregulation of PGP 9.5. Management of Parathyroid Carcinoma En-Bloc Resection (Option B) Includes removal of adjacent invaded tissues; performed in 12.5% of cases Resectable Parathyroid Carcinoma (Local or regional recurrence of parathyroid carcinoma) En-bloc resection is standard for initial and recurrent disease, involving the removal of the tumor along with any invaded structures. Lymph Node Dissection: Performed only if lymph node involvement is confirmed. (Option C) CDC73/HRPT2 Variant Carriers: Bilateral exploration or selective resection of abnormal glands. Total parathyroidectomy is not favored. (Option D) Metastasis: Spreads locally, invading adjacent structures in the neck such as the thyroid gland and strap muscles. Surgical resection of metastasis for palliation of hypercalcemia Post-op Serum Calcium Monitoring: Essential for managing \"hungry bone syndrome\". Medical Therapy for Unresectable Parathyroid Carcinoma (When parathyroid carcinoma is not resectable due to widespread dissemination) Managed with hypercalcemia control and palliative care. Bisphosphonates: Intravenous zoledronic acid or pamidronate. Calcimimetics: Cinacalcet is used if bisphosphonates are ineffective. It works on the calcium-sensing receptor (CASR) of the parathyroid gland and controls the parathyroid hormone. Denosumab: For hypercalcemia, refractory to bisphosphonates and cinacalcet. Biotherapy Emerging therapies include parafibromin inhibitors, telomerase inhibitors, and immune therapies.

      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: B) Hypocalcemia due to damage to the parathyroid glands Explanation: The patient's symptoms of numbness, tingling, muscle cramps, and decreased serum calcium levels indicate hypocalcemia. The most common cause of hypocalcemia following thyroid surgery is damage to the parathyroid glands or their blood supply. HYPOPARATHYROIDISM Common Causes: Thyroid Surgery Most frequent cause. is damage to the parathyroid glands or their blood supply. (Option B) Risk Factors: Bilateral neck exploration, Extensive central neck dissection, Revision surgery, Thyroidectomy for Graves' disease, Pediatric patients. Autoimmune Disorders Autoimmune polyendocrine syndrome type 1 (APS-1). Genetic Conditions DiGeorge syndrome , autosomal dominant hypocalcemia. Radiation Therapy Radiation to the neck area can damage parathyroid glands. Medications Lithium, and some chemotherapeutic agents (Pembrolizumab). Prevention: Surgical Precautions: Careful dissection and preservation of parathyroid glands. Examine surgical specimens for removed parathyroid tissue. Autotransplant confirmed parathyroid tissue into the sternocleidomastoid muscle. Calcium and Vit D Supplementation: Administer calcium (with/without calcitriol) proactively for total thyroidectomy patients. Measure intraoperative PTH or intact PTH levels four hours postoperatively to guide supplementation. Management: Temporary Hypoparathyroidism: Resolves within 6 months. Permanent Hypoparathyroidism: Requires ongoing calcium and/or Vit D replacement. Postoperative hypophosphatemia (Option A) is unlikely as the symptoms and decreased calcium levels suggest hypocalcemia from parathyroid damage. Persistent hypoparathyroidism in dialysis patients can cause chronic hypophosphatemia, but this is not typical immediately after thyroid surgery. Postoperative bleeding leading to hypovolemia (Option D): Bleeding could cause signs of shock and low blood pressure, but it does not directly cause hypocalcemia.

Pathophysiology : Rapid calcium uptake by bones after removal of excess hormone (PTH). Symptoms: Seizures, Tetany, Paresthesias, Carpopedal spasms, Arrhythmias, Laryngospasm Management: Oral Supplements : Calcium carbonate or calcium citrate. Indications for IV Calcium : Serum calcium <7.6 mg/dL, symptomatic patients, or EKG changes. IV Calcium: Calcium gluconate (preferred) or calcium chloride. Option A: Pseudohypoparathyroidism (PHP) is a rare inherited disorder characterized by target organ resistance or unresponsiveness to parathyroid hormone (PTH). Option C: Persistent hyperparathyroidism is defined as an elevated calcium within 6 weeks of surgical intervention .

      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: C) Secondary hyperparathyroidism Explanation: A raised parathyroid hormone with normal or low serum calcium level points to the diagnosis of secondary hyperparathyroidism. Secondary hyperparathyroidism (Option C) Definition Physiologic response of parathyroid glands to hypocalcemia Causes Chronic renal failure: I phosphate excretion I serum phosphate binds to serum calcium & I free serum calcium levels. I 1-hydroxylase activity in the kidney § I 1,25 (OH)2 vitamin D formation § I intestinal absorption of calcium. This results in increased secretion of parathyroid hormone. Vitamin D deficiency Intestinal calcium malabsorption/ steatorrhoea Management Phosphate intake should be reduced, and phosphate binders should be used to manage excess phosphate. Vitamin D and calcium supplementation. Parathyroidectomy should be considered if secretion remains abnormal. Patients with Chronic renal failure: High Calcium, low aluminium dialysis bath. Tertiary hyperparathyroidism (Option B) Definition It is a condition characterized by persistent autonomous hypercalcemic hyperparathyroidism after a kidney transplant. Causes Impaired graft function, non-suppressible PTH, slow gland involution, insufficient calcitriol conversion. Diagnosis Elevated serum calcium, elevated PTH, reduced phosphate (at least 1 year post-transplant). Management Surgical intervention : Mainstay of treatment: Subtotal or total parathyroidectomy with autotransplantation of parathyroid gland. Primary hyperparathyroidism (HPT) (Option A) is characterized by excess synthesis and secretion of PTH by abnormal parathyroid glands and is the most common cause of hypercalcemia in adults. It is typically caused by adenoma, hyperplasia, or cancer. It is associated with MEN1 and MEN2A syndromes. Calciphylaxis (Option C), aka Calcific uremic arteriolopathy, is a rare disease causing painful violaceous skin lesions with ulceration, ischemia, necrosis, and eschar formation. It mainly affects patients with end-stage renal disease and secondary HPT. The preferred treatment is total parathyroidectomy with transcervical thymectomy.

      "explanation": "Correct Answer: C) Parathyroidectomy Explanation: In severely symptomatic primary hyperparathyroidism (PHPT), the most preferred mode of management is surgical management . The main modality of treatment is as follows: Indications of parathyroidectomy: Severe symptoms Young age Markedly reduced bone density Serum calcium more than 11mg% Urinary calculi Neuromuscular symptoms Urinary calcium more than 400mg/24 hours Indications of surgery in an asymptomatic case are: Serum calcium 0.25 mmol/L (1.0 mg/dL) above the upper limit of normal Bone mineral density (BMD) by DEXA; T score –2.5 at lumbar spine, total hip, femoral neck, or distal one-third of radius Vertebral fracture Creatinine clearance <60 mL/min 24-hour urinary calcium >10 mmol/dL (>400 mg/day) or increased risk of stone formation by risk analysis Age <50 years When medical therapy is not possible Miami Protocol: An intraoperative PTH is measured If it has reduced by more than 50% than the preoperative value, it indicates correct gland removal. Casanova test: It is to differentiate Recurrence site after Removal of all 4 Parathyroid gland and auto transplant of it. PTH measurements are taken from the neck vein & brachial vessel. A positive Casanova test is if 20 times higher concentration in the brachial vessel Contraindications of surgery: Absolute contraindication: familial hypercalciuric hypercalcemia Here, elevated calcium and PTH level but 24 hr urinary calcium and calcium to creatinine clearance are low Parathyroidectomy does not cure hypercalcemia due to FHH syndrome Relative contraindications: Controlateral recurrent laryngeal nerve injury Vocal cord dysfunction Selective estrogen receptor modulators (Option A) like raloxifene are used to treat osteoporosis and improve bone mineral density. It confers the benefits of hormone replacement therapy but without the potential adverse vascular and breast effects. Bisphosphonates (Option B) like alendronate increases the bone mineral density and does not affect the levels of PTH or calcium. Calcimimetic drugs (Option D) like cinacalcet works by activating the calcium receptors and reducing the levels of PTH and calcium but does not increase the bone mineral density.

        "C": "4D computed tomography",
        "D": "MRI"
      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: B) Sestamibi scan Explanation: Sestamibi scan is a type of nuclear medicine-based study that is most accurate for parathyroid lesion localization. It is safe and reproducible . It has a sensitivity and specificity similar to ultrasound but may detect glands in ectopic positions better. Sestamibi accumulates in the mitochondria and hence the rates at which it washes out differs as per the number of mitochondria in different tissues. Parathyroid adenoma is rich in oxyphilic cells with a high concentration of mitochondria and hence has a lower washout than the thyroid gland. False positives are rare and the sensitivity and specificity are 79% and 90% respectively. Addition of a thyroid specific radioactive-tracer eliminates the chance of false positives. Other investigations: Parathyroid angiography and venous sampling for parathyroid hormone. Biochemical analysis is always to be done. Ultrasonography (Option A) : Parathyroid adenoma is identified as an oval/ elongated, bi or multiloculated hypoechoic structure. Advantage: Can identify and facilitate biopsy of any concomitant thyroid pathology. Disadvantage : Adenomas in retro-oesophageal, retrosternal, or retro-tracheal areas can be missed. 4D CT (Option C) : Rapid uptake and washout allow hyperfunctioning glands to be differentiated from lymph nodes that demonstrate a progressive enhancement pattern. Disadvantage: Higher radiation dose than traditional imaging. MRI (Option D) : Not commonly used, but helpful for preoperative cases or mediastinal adenomas. Has poor resolution for small glands/adenomas <5 mm, and it is difficult to localize superior glands. Biochemical tests: Serum calcium levels High Intact PTH Low or inappropriately high Serum phosphate Low 24-hour urinary calcium High Chloride to phosphate ratio High 1,25- hydroxy Vitamin D Normal or raised Casanova test: The modified Casanova test evaluates the long-term function of autotransplanted parathyroid glands. During the test, ischemic blockage is induced by a tourniquet, and PTH levels are measured. A significant reduction in PTH indicates well-functioning autografts, while minimal change ( ≤ 20% of baseline) suggests functioning residual parathyroid tissue elsewhere. This test can detect graft-dependent recurrent hyperparathyroidism and identify persistent hypoparathyroidism before surgery.",
