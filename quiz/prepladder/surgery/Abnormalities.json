        "D": "Collecting duct carcinoma"
      },
      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: C) Clear cell renal cell carcinoma Explanation: The clinical presentation and histopathological findings are indicative of clear cell renal cell carcinoma (CCRCC). The size of the tumor and involvement of the renal vein indicate an advanced stage, underscoring the aggressive nature of CCRCC. Classification and salient features of variants of RCC RCC Variants Salient features Clear cell renal cell carcinoma (CCRCC (Option C) Most common variant Usually sporadic May be associated with the loss of chromosome 3p and a mutated von Hippel–Lindau gene Macroscopic appearance: solid, golden-yellow tumor with areas of hemorrhage and necrosis. Microscopy : cells have clear cytoplasm due to the presence of abundant lipids and glycogen, surrounded by a delicate network of vasculature. Papillary renal cell carcinoma (Option B) Second most common variant It can be further divided into Type 1 and Type 2 Type 1 has small basophilic cells and Type 2 is characterized by large eosinophilic cells. Type 1 has a better prognosis than type 2. Associated with mutations in the MET gene - chromosome 7, 17, or Y. Chromophobe renal cell carcinoma (Option A) Arises from the intercalated cells of the collecting ducts. Microscopy: Characterized by large polygonal cells with prominent cell membranes and pale cytoplasm. Better prognosis compared to other types of RCC. Collecting duct carcinoma (Option D) Also known as Bellini duct carcinoma. Rare and aggressive form of RCC that arises from the collecting ducts in the renal medulla, hence centrally located. Poor prognosis Renal medullary carcinoma Rare and aggressive Associated with sickle cell trait in children Centrally located Reference: Bailey and Love’s Short Practice of Surgery, 8th Edition, Page 1483",

      "question": "A 70-year-old male with a history of hypertension is diagnosed with renal cell carcinoma (RCC) after a CT scan reveals a 5 cm tumor confined to the right kidney. His renal function is normal, and there is no evidence of metastasis. What is the most appropriate initial treatment for this patient?",

        "B": "Radical Nephrectomy",
        "C": "Radiofrequency Ablation",
        "D": "Targeted Therapy"
      },
      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: A) Partial Nephrectomy Explanation: In this patient's case, with a 5 cm tumor confined to the kidney and no evidence of metastasis, Partial Nephrectomy is the most appropriate initial treatment option. This approach will effectively manage the localized RCC while preserving renal function. Investigations for RCC: Ultrasound (USG) Initial Imaging Helps distinguish between solid and cystic masses Contrast-enhanced CT (CECT) Investigation of choice for diagnosis and staging. MRI Superior at detecting tumor infiltration into the vein wall and the level of thrombus. Investigation of choice for detecting tumor thrombus Chest Imaging (CT or X-ray), Bone Scan To rule out metastases. Renal Biopsy Not routinely performed due to the risk of seeding and the high diagnostic accuracy of imaging. Treatment of RCC: RCCs are radio and chemo-resistant. Surgical Management: Partial Nephrectomy (Option A) : Involves removing only the tumor while preserving the remainder of the kidney. Indications: T1 Disease(<7cm) Restricted to poles RCC in solitary functioning kidney Radical Nephrectomy: Involves removal of the kidney with Gerota’s fascia, para-aortic nodes, and ureter up to the pelvic brim. Indications: Larger tumors or when partial nephrectomy is not feasible Ablative Techniques Radiofrequency Ablation (RFA) and Cryoablation: Involve destroying the tumor using extreme temperatures. Indications: Patients who are not surgical candidates Patients with small tumors(T1a lesions) (usually <4 cm). Systemic Therapy (For advanced/ metastatic disease) Targeted Therapy Tyrosine kinase inhibitors (e.g., sunitinib, pazopanib) mTOR inhibitors (e.g., everolimus) Immunotherapy: Immune checkpoint inhibitors (e.g., nivolumab) Radical Nephrectomy (Option B) : This is more aggressive than necessary for a small, localized tumor, as it removes the entire kidney, leading to unnecessary loss of renal function. Radiofrequency Ablation (Option C) : Typically reserved for patients who are not surgical candidates, it's less effective than surgery for long-term tumor control in healthy patients. Targeted Therapy (Option D) : Used for metastatic or advanced RCC, it's not indicated as the initial treatment for a localized tumor with no evidence of metastasis.

      "question": "A 28-year-old woman is incidentally found to have a horseshoe kidney during an abdominal CT scan. She has no symptoms. Which of the following complications is she at highest risk for developing?",
      "options": {
        "A": "Pelviureteric junction obstruction",
        "B": "Renal cell carcinoma",
        "C": "Renal artery stenosis",
        "D": "Nephroptosis"
      },
      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: A) Pelviureteric junction (PUJ) obstruction Explanation: Horseshoe kidney increases the risk of PUJ obstruction due to the abnormal position of the kidneys and the associated vascular anomalies, which can compress the ureters and impair urine flow. Horseshoe Kidney Causes: During fetal development the kidneys fuse at their lower poles, forming a U-shaped structure. This fusion results in the inferior mesenteric artery preventing the ascent of the isthmus of the kidney to its normal position in the abdomen, leading to an abnormal location lower in the abdomen. Clinical Features: Mostly asymptomatic. Pain: due to obstruction or renal stones. Recurrent urinary tract infections (UTIs) Hydronephrosis Hematuria Rovsing's syndrome: Hyperextension of the spine- nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain. Investigations: CT Angiography (CT Angio): This is the investigation of choice for diagnosing a horseshoe kidney, as it allows for detailed visualization of the renal anatomy, the abnormal vascular supply, and associated complications. Contrast-Enhanced CT (CECT): Used when CT Angio is not available Intravenous Pyelogram (IVP) - characteristic findings include : Medial Orientation of Calyces: Referred to as the \"Hand Joining Sign.\" High Insertion of Ureters with Anterior Transposition: This creates a \"Flower Vase\" appearance of the ureters. Treatment: Treatment depends on the presence and severity of symptoms: Asymptomatic Patients: Typically do not require treatment, but should be monitored periodically. Symptomatic Patients: UPJ Obstruction: Surgical intervention such as pyeloplasty Kidney Stones: Management may include conservative measures like increased fluid intake, medical therapy, or surgical removal UTIs: Treated with antibiotics, and preventive measures may be considered if infections are recurrent. Isthmus Management: The isthmus of the horseshoe kidney should not be divided surgically as it contains functional renal tissue. Pregnancy Considerations: A horseshoe kidney can lead to dystocia (difficult labor) due to the kidney's abnormal position. Renal cell carcinoma (Option B) : While the risk of renal cell carcinoma is slightly increased in patients with a horseshoe kidney, it is not as common as UPJ obstruction. Renal artery stenosis (Option C) : Renal artery stenosis is not directly associated with horseshoe kidney, though the abnormal anatomy can complicate vascular supply, it is not the most common complication. Nephroptosis (Option D) : Nephroptosis (a floating kidney) does not occur in horseshoe kidneys because the kidneys are fused and anchored in place",

      "question": "A 6-year-old boy presents with recurrent urinary tract infections and a palpable abdominal mass. Imaging reveals a cystic dilation near the ureteral orifice within the bladder. Which of the following best describes the underlying condition?",
      "options": {
        "A": "Ureterocele",
        "B": "Bladder diverticulum",
        "C": "Ectopic ureter",
        "D": "Vesicoureteral reflux"
      },
      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: A) Ureterocele Explanation: The boy's recurrent UTIs and palpable abdominal mass, along with imaging showing cystic dilation near the ureteral orifice, are indicative of a ureterocele . Ureterocele is the congenital dilation of the distal ureter within the bladder wall. It can obstruct urine flow, leading to recurrent UTIs and hydronephrosis. Treatment often involves surgical correction to relieve the obstruction. Ureterocele: 1. Types: Simple Ureterocele (Intravesical - 20%): Found entirely within the bladder and associated with a single ureter. It is less complex and easier to manage. Ectopic Ureterocele (80%) : Extends beyond the bladder and often involves a duplicated ureter. This is more complicated due to its location, which may involve the bladder neck, or urethra. 2. Causes: Congenital anomaly caused by an obstruction in the development of the distal ureter during fetal growth, leading to cystic dilation at the ureteral orifice. 3. Clinical Features: Recurrent Urinary Tract Infections (UTIs)/ Urosepsis. Unilateral Hydroureteronephrosis. Palpable Abdominal Mass: Particularly in children, where a distended bladder or large ureterocele might be felt as a mass. 4. Investigations: Ultrasound (USG): The first-line imaging modality, revealing hydroureteronephrosis and a cystic structure in the bladder corresponding to the ureterocele. Micturating Cystourethrogram (MCU): Demonstrates a filling defect in the bladder caused by the ureterocele. Cystoscopy: Allows direct visualization of the ureterocele as a cystic structure that enlarges and collapses with urine flow in the bladder. Intravenous Pyelogram (IVP): The investigation of choice (IOC) for diagnosing ureterocele, showing the characteristic \"adder head\" or \"cobra head\" appearance due to the dilated ureter within the bladder. 5. Treatment: The treatment approach depends on the type of ureterocele: Intravesical Ureterocele: Typically managed with an incision over the cyst wall to allow free flow of urine into the bladder, relieving the obstruction. Ectopic Ureterocele: More complex, often requiring surgical excision of the ureterocele and reimplantation of the ureter into the bladder to correct the abnormal anatomy. 6. Associated Congenital Abnormalities: The most common congenital abnormality of the upper urinary tract is ureteral duplication , which can be associated with ureterocele. Vesicoureteric reflux (VUR) , another common congenital abnormality, may occur in conjunction with ureterocele, particularly in cases involving ureteral duplication. Bladder diverticulum (Option B) : A bladder diverticulum is an outpouching of the bladder wall, not a cystic dilation of the ureter near the bladder. It usually does not obstruct the ureteral orifice. Ectopic ureter (Option C) : An ectopic ureter does not open into the bladder in its usual location. While it can cause obstruction and infection, it does not present as a cystic dilation within the bladder. Vesicoureteral reflux (Option D) : This condition",

        "D": "Ureteric balloon dilatation"
      },
      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: C) Pyeloplasty Explanation: Pyeloplasty is the surgical procedure of choice for correcting PUJ obstruction. It involves reconstructing the ureteropelvic junction to relieve the obstruction, restoration of normal urine flow, and prevent further kidney damage. Pelviureteric Junction (PUJ) obstruction is a condition where the flow of urine from the renal pelvis into the ureter is impeded due to a narrowing or blockage at the junction between the renal pelvis and the ureter. Causes: Congenital Acquired Atresia/stenosis - Developmental anomaly that leads to an intrinsic narrowing Aberrant left renal artery - The presence of an abnormal blood vessel compressing the junction externally Scarring from previous infections Kidney stones (most common) Surgery - stricture formation Clinical Features: Intermittent Flank Pain - increased fluid intake or diuresis, which increases urine production and pressure at the obstruction site. Hematuria - if there are associated kidney stones. Recurrent Urinary Tract Infections Hydronephrosis - may be asymptomatic in the early stages. Investigations: Ultrasound: Can reveal hydronephrosis without dilation of the ureter below the obstruction. Diuretic Renal Scan (DTPA Scan) - Investigation of choice: A DTPA scan evaluates renal function and drainage, helping to quantify the severity of obstruction. Whittaker’s Test: This is an invasive pressure-flow study used if the DTPA Scan is equivocal, to differentiate between true obstruction and non-obstructive hydronephrosis by measuring the pressure gradient across the PUJ. Magnetic Resonance Urography (MRU): Helps to pinpoint the location and cause of the obstruction. Treatment: Surgical Treatment: Anderson-Hynes Dismembered Pyeloplasty (Option C) : Gold-standard treatment for PUJ obstruction. The procedure involves cutting out the narrowed segment and reattaching the healthy ureter to the renal pelvis, ensuring a wide and unobstructed passage. Foley V-Y Pyeloplasty: When there is a short segment of obstruction or if the pelvis is intrarenal (within the kidney tissue). Flap Pyeloplasty (Spiral or Vertical): Used in specific cases where the obstruction involves a small segment or an intrarenal pelvis. A flap of renal pelvis tissue is used to widen the narrowed area. Endoscopic Treatment (Option D) : Endopyelotomy: Using a laser or electrocautery - an incision is made within the PUJ via an endoscope to relieve the obstruction. Balloon Dilatation: A balloon is inflated at the site of the obstruction to widen the narrowed junction. Observation (Option B) : In asymptomatic patients with mild hydronephrosis, regular monitoring with imaging and renal function tests might be sufficient. Percutaneous nephrostomy (Option A) : This is a temporary measure for relieving obstruction in emergency cases, not a definitive treatment for PUJ obstruction.",

      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: A) Pulmonary hypoplasia Explanation: In bilateral renal agenesis , the absence of fetal kidneys leads to a lack of amniotic fluid (oligohydramnios), which is crucial for lung development. This results in underdeveloped lungs - pulmonary hypoplasia - leading to respiratory failure at birth. Renal agenesis is a congenital condition characterized by the absence of one or both kidneys. The bladder is usually absent. Bilateral renal agenesis causes Potter syndrome and is typically fatal. Potter syndrome is associated with: Oligohydramnios Pulmonary hypoplasia Potter facies Limb deformities - clubfoot or other positional abnormalities. Growth restriction Medullary sponge kidney (MSK) (Option C) : A congenital, autosomal recessive condition. Characterized by cystic dilatation of the renal collecting tubules, typically in the medulla, giving the medulla a sponge-like or honeycomb appearance. It can be bilateral, unilateral, or affect a single papilla. Diagnosis: Excretory urograms or contrast-enhanced CT scans show dilated tubules near the calyces with possible radiopaque material. Intravenous pyelography- bristles of brush appearance, bouquet of flowers appearance. Presentation: Hematuria. Increased risk of urinary infections and kidney stones due to urinary stasis.

      },
      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: C) Wunderlich syndrome Explanation: Wunderlich syndrome is a rare, life-threatening condition characterized by spontaneous, non-traumatic renal hemorrhage into the subcapsular and perirenal spaces typically associated with renal angiomyolipomas (AMLs). In patients with renal angiomyolipoma, particularly those associated with tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) , the risk of hemorrhage is heightened , leading to symptoms such as flank pain, hypotension, and tenderness. Angiomyolipomas (AMLs) Arise from Perivascular epithelioid cells Types Most renal AMLs are asymptomatic , discovered incidentally on imaging. Sporadic AMLs: Present in the 4th-6th decades, typically small, solitary, and slow-growing. TSC-associated AMLs: Present earlier (3rd-4th decades), larger, multiple, bilateral, and tend to grow. Symptoms Common symptoms : Abdominal or flank pain, hematuria, hypertension, anemia, and impaired kidney function, usually due to hemorrhage. Hemorrhage: Severe complication. Wunderlich syndrome : nontraumatic kidney hemorrhage. Risk factors for hemorrhage: AML size (>6 cm), increased vascularity, large intralesional aneurysms (>5 mm), and exophytic growth pattern. Risk Factors for AML Complications Pregnancy: Increased risk of hemorrhage due to hormonal changes, increased blood volume, and cardiac output. TSC-associated AMLs: Higher risk of CKD and ESKD, often due to nephrectomy or embolization. Epithelioid AMLs: Potential for malignant transformation, metastasis, and local recurrence. Diagnosis CT: (Investigation of choice) Presence of intralesional fat. Ultrasound: Bright echogenic mass lesion on account of the high fat content. Used for monitoring AML size. MRI: T1 and T2 hyperintensity with enhancement on gadolinium administration. In Phase/opposed phase imaging: India ink artifact. Useful mainly in fat poor AML. Biopsy: Indicated if diagnosis is uncertain via imaging or malignancy is suspected. Immunocytochemical analysis: Useful for differentiating AML from RCC, using markers like HMB-45 and melan-A. Treatment Observation: Suitable for tumors <4 cm Nephron-Sparing Surgery(Partial nephrectomy): Preferred for larger tumors or those with a high risk of bleeding Angioembolization: Main treatment for acute hemorrhage, involves blocking blood flow to the tumor.

Wilms' Tumor or Nephroblastoma Most common malignant pediatric renal tumor. Mostly unilateral but can be bilateral. Caused by mutations in WT1 and WT2 genes on chromosome 11. Syndromes Associated with Wilms' Tumor: Denys-Drash Syndrome (DDS): Triad of Wilms' tumor , diffuse mesangial sclerosis leading to early-onset nephrotic syndrome, and male pseudohermaphroditism (ambiguous genitalia in a genetically male patient with 46XY karyotype). Caused by missense mutations in the WT1 gene on chromosome 11p13, which disrupt normal kidney and gonadal development. Typically present with severe proteinuria, ambiguous genitalia, and a high risk of developing Wilms' tumor, usually by the age of 3 years. WAGR Syndrome: Includes W ilms' tumor, A niridia (absence of the iris), G enitourinary anomalies , and Mental R etardation . Caused by a deletion in the 11p13 region of the WT1 gene. Beckwith-Wiedemann Syndrome (BWS): BWS is an overgrowth disorder characterized by macroglossia, hemihyperplasia, organomegaly, omphalocele , and increased risk of Wilms tumor. Associated with genetic and epigenetic changes in the 11p15 region , which includes genes like IGF2 . They do not exhibit the nephropathy or ambiguous genitalia seen in DDS. (Option A) Perlman Syndrome: A rare congenital overgrowth syndrome characterized by nephroblastomatosis, macrosomia, umbilical hernia, and facial dysmorphism , with a high risk of Wilms tumor. (Option D) It involves mutations in the DIS3L2 gene. Frasier Syndrome (Option C) : Presents with focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS) leading to slowly progressive nephropathy and an increased risk of gonadoblastoma . Wilms tumor is rare in this syndrome. Caused by mutations in the WT1 gene , specifically involving intron 9 splicing.

      },
      "correct_answer": "D",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: D) Polycythemia Explanation: Polycythemia in this patient is likely due to ectopic erythropoietin production by renal cell carcinoma, which is a known paraneoplastic manifestation. The sudden onset of symptoms like headaches and visual disturbances can be attributed to the increased blood viscosity caused by polycythemia. Clinical Features of Renal Cell Carcinoma (RCC): Classic symptoms such as hematuria, flank pain, and a palpable abdominal mass - “ TOO - LATE” TRIAD seen in 10% of patients with advanced disease. Systemic symptoms like weight loss, fever, and fatigue can also occur. In advanced stages, RCC may metastasize to the lungs, bones, and brain. A non-reducing varicocele, referred to as a suspicious varicocele, may indicate the presence of renal cell carcinoma (RCC), often due to a thrombus originating from the left RCC. Paraneoplastic Manifestations: Elevated ESR . Hypercalcemia: The ectopic production of parathyroid hormone-related peptide (PTHrP) by the tumor, leads to increased calcium levels in the blood. This can cause symptoms like nausea, vomiting, and confusion (Option B) . Hypertension: Hypertension in RCC can be due to increased renin production by the tumor or as a result of polycythemia. (Option C) Cushing’s disease: Although less common, Cushing's syndrome can occur as a paraneoplastic manifestation due to ectopic production of ACTH by the tumor, leading to elevated cortisol levels. Addison’s disease is not generally caused by RCC (Option A) . Stauffer's syndrome: (Non metastatic reversible hepatitis) RCC patient with jaundice - Raised Bilirubin, ALP.

      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: B) Renal Oncocytoma Explanation: Renal Oncocytoma is characterized by granular, eosinophilic cytoplasm due to abundant mitochondria (oncocytes). The enhancing mass with a central stellate scar is are the suggestive feature. Renal Oncocytoma Definition & Prevalence Benign renal tumor with oncocytes, characterized by granular, eosinophilic cytoplasm. Accounts for ~5% of all renal tumors. Clinical Presentation Typically occurs in the seventh decade of life, more common in males. Can coexist with RCC in ~10% of cases Diagnosis CECT : ( Investigation of choice): Presents as an enhancing mass, while not pathognomonic, can suggest oncocytoma: Central Stellate Scarring: The presence of a star-shaped scar within the tumor. Spoke Wheel Appearance : A characteristic pattern observed during the angiographic phase of imaging. Confirmation of Diagnosis Confirmed post-surgical removal and histopathological examination of oncocytes. Differentiation from chromophobe RCC (eosinophilic variant) may require immunohistochemistry, where chromophobe RCC stains positive for cytokeratin 7 and oncocytoma is positive. Treatment & Prognosis Nephron-sparing surgery ( partial nephrectomy ) is the preferred treatment due to its benign nature. Clear Cell Renal Cell Carcinoma (Option A) typically has cells with clear cytoplasm due to the loss of lipids, and it does not commonly present with a central scar. Chromophobe Renal Cell Carcinoma (Option C) usually lacks the central stellate scar and has a different histological appearance with more distinct cell borders and perinuclear halos, staining positive for cytokeratin 7. Papillary Renal Cell Carcinoma (Option D) often has a papillary architecture and cells with more foamy or pale cytoplasm, and the presence of a central scar is not typical.",
