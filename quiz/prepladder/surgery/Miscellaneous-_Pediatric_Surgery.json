If the distal part communicates: Distal duplication . Presence of ectopic gastric mucosa (ileal ulcer) → acid production → ulcer → bleeding → hematochezia. Diagnosis: On USG - Triple layer effect is seen (characteristic appearance) IOC for diagnosis - CECT Tc-Pertechnetate scan in case of ectopic gastric mucosa. Treatment : For short segment duplication: Resection and anastomosis For long segment duplication: Multiple enterotomy with stripping of mucosa Division of common wall by stapler.",

Teratomas mostly occur during the neonatal period and most of them are benign Most common site- Sacrococcygeal region Females > males The risk of malignancy increases with age It is thought to be derivative of the primitive streak Clinical features: External presacral mass with minimal intrapelvic presacral component Symptoms include weakness, paralysis, and bladder or bowel dysfunction Currarino Triad: Anorectal malformations + sacrococcygeal osseous defect + presacral mass Diagnosis: Clinical diagnosis CT/MRI is done to detect intra-abdominal and intra-pelvic components. Treatment: Complete surgical excision of the tumor should be done To avoid local recurrence - resection of the coccyx is done Spina bifida (Option A) : Typically presents with a midline defect in the spine but without erosion of the coccyx or a prominent cough impulse. Myelomeningocele (Option B) : Involves herniation of the meninges and spinal cord, usually in the lumbosacral region, but is not characterized by coccygeal erosion or a teratoma-like mass. Sacral agenesis (Option D): A developmental disorder characterized by the absence of parts of the sacrum but not typically associated with a mass or erosion of the coccyx.",

      "explanation": "pelvic floor. Correct Answer: C) Invertogram; assesses the rectal termination by the rise of gas in relation to the pelvic floor. Explanation: An invertogram is the diagnostic method used to differentiate between high and low lesions in anorectal malformation. Assessment Method: Invertogram is used to determine the rectal termination relative to the pelvic floor. This test is typically performed 6-12 hours after birth. A coin is placed at the location where the anus is expected, and the baby is positioned upside down for at least 3 minutes. The gas is going to rise at the distal part of the large intestine. High Lesion: The rectum ends above the Levator ani complex. Low Lesion: The rectum ends below the Levator ani complex. Abdominal ultrasound (Option A) does not specifically differentiate high vs. low lesions based on rectal termination relative to the pelvic floor. MRI of the pelvis (Option B) is not typically used for this specific diagnostic purpose in anorectal malformation. X-ray of the pelvis (Option D) does not accurately determine the rectal termination in relation to the pelvic floor.",

      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "duodenum Correct Answer: B) Reduction of volvulus; Widening of the mesenteric base by mobilizing the duodenum Explanation: Reduction of Volvulus : This is a key component of the LADD's operation, which involves correcting the twisted bowel. Widening of the Mesenteric Base : During the procedure, the duodenum is mobilized and straightened by dividing the abnormal ligament of Treitz and LADD’s bands to prevent future volvulus. LADD's Operation Components : Reduction of Volvulus : Correcting the twisted bowel. Division of LADD's Bands : Cutting the fibrous bands that may cause obstruction. Appendectomy : Removing the appendix to prevent future diagnostic confusion. Positioning of the Intestine : Adjusting the placement of the intestines, with or without fixation. Steps : RUQ Transverse Incision : Making an incision across the right upper quadrant. Counter-Clockwise Rotation : Correcting the volvulus by rotating the bowel counter-clockwise. Bowel with Uncertain Viability : Wrapping potentially viable bowel in warm, moist sponges for at least 15 minutes. Resection of Gangrenous Bowel : Removing any necrotic bowel sections. (Option C) Division of LADD's Bands : Cutting the bands near the lateral side of the duodenum. (Option A) Widening of the Mesenteric Base : Mobilizing and straightening the duodenum by dividing the abnormal ligament of Treitz and LADD's bands. Appendectomy : Performing an appendectomy to avoid future diagnostic issues. Final Bowel Position : Duodenum and Proximal Jejunum : Positioned on the right side of the abdomen. (Option D) Terminal Ileum and Cecum : Positioned on the left side of the abdomen. (A) Bowel is assessed and, if volvulus is present, gently detorsed in a counterclockwise direction (arrow). (B) Ladd bands attaching the colon to the liver, gallbladder, or retroperitoneum are divided sharply or with electrocautery. (C) Adhesions to the mesentery are divided (arrows) and the mesenteric pedicle widened, allowing the colon to be placed on the left side of the patient and the small bowel with a straightened duodenum on the right.

The baby has been experiencing intermittent abdominal pain and has not been gaining weight as expected. On examination, the infant shows signs of poor perfusion and decreased urine output. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis, and what should be the primary investigation to confirm it?",

        "D": "Pyloric Stenosis; Barium Swallow Study"
      },
      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: A) Intestinal Malrotation with Midgut Volvulus; Upper GI Contrast Study and metabolic acidosis suggests midgut volvulus , a serious complication of malrotation. Upper GI Contrast Study is the primary investigation to confirm malrotation. It allows visualization of the positioning of the duodenum and the ligament of Treitz and can identify midgut volvulus. Clinical Features of malrotation: Asymptomatic Cases : Malrotation can be discovered incidentally through radiological exams or during an autopsy when no symptoms are present. Symptomatic Cases : Without Volvulus : Symptoms include persistent abdominal pain, bilious vomiting, and failure to thrive (inadequate weight gain). With Volvulus (Emergency Situation) : The primary symptom may be bilious vomiting, which can sometimes be the sole indication of midgut volvulus. Lethargy due to inadequate blood flow. Decreased urine output . Metabolic acidosis . Investigations: Laboratory Findings : Metabolic acidosis Thrombocytopenia Leucopenia Gold Standard for Diagnosis : The Upper GI Contrast Study is the preferred method for diagnosing malrotation. Barium Swallow : This test is not typically used for diagnosing malrotation because it does not effectively rule out malrotation (Option C and D) . Pyloric stenosis (Option B) presents in infants between 3-6 weeks of age and the vomiting is non-bilious because the obstruction is proximal to the duodenum. Additionally, the imaging investigation for pyloric stenosis is ultrasound , not an upper GI contrast study. An ultrasound would show the characteristic \"olive sign\" and pyloric muscle hypertrophy. Management For Acutely Ill Children with Peritonitis: Exploratory Laparotomy is performed as an emergency procedure. For Symptomatic Volvulus: Administer IV fluids and IV antibiotics. Decompress the proximal stomach. Proceed with emergency surgery. For Chronic Symptoms or Symptom-Free Patients: Plan for elective correction. The standard surgical approach is the LADD's procedure.",

        "D": "The presence of Ladd's bands is noticed"
      },
      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: A) The cecum is located in the left hypochondrium Explanation: Hyper-rotation occurs when there is excessive counter-clockwise rotation of the midgut beyond the 270° rotation. Due to this excessive rotation, the cecum, which normally ends up in the right lower quadrant of the abdomen, may be displaced to the left upper quadrant (left hypochondrium) . This abnormal positioning is a direct result of the excessive rotation of the midgut. Types of rotational abnormalities: Rotational Abnormalit Description Abnormalities Non-Rotation Most common rotational abnormality. Failure of counter-clockwise rotation after return of midgut to the abdominal cavity. Duodenum (C-loop), Ligament of Treitz, and small intestine are on the right side. Cecum and large intestine are on the left side. Proximal jejunum and ascending colon fused as one pedicle. Incomplete Rotation Most common type of malrotation. Arrested counter-clockwise rotation around 180° (Option C) . Small intestine lies on the right side. DJ flexure located on the right side of the vertebral column. Duodenum may have a corkscrew configuration. Major part of the large intestine on the left side. Cecum is close to midline. Right colon located more medially. Failure of fixation of ascending colon in right hypochondrium, leading to narrow intestinal mesentery and presence of Ladd's bands. (Option D) Reverse Rotation Rotation occurs in a clockwise direction around the SMA. Duodenum is anterior to the superior mesenteric artery. Transverse colon is posterior to the superior mesenteric artery. Hyper-Rotation Counter-clockwise rotation greater than 270°. Cecum is located in the left hypochondrium (Option A) . Mixed Rotation Intestine does not rotate as it enters the abdomen after a physiological hernia. Cecum is located in the midline, inferior to the pylorus (Option B) . Increased risk of volvulus.

      },
      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: A) Complicated meconium ileus Explanation: Meconium ileus is complicated by perforation in utero or just after birth. This leads to peritonitis. This results in: Dense inflammatory adhesions Calcification (snowstorm appearance in USG) Clinical features: Meconium pseudocyst Adhesive peritonitis with or without bacterial infection Ascites Diagnosis: X-ray Specks of calcification Dilated bowel loops Mass Effect On USG: Snowstorm appearance(characteristic finding) Management: For uncomplicated cases - Non-operative treatment like enemas with Gastrografin, N-acetylcysteine 10% solution for irrigation per-rectum, or via NG tube. In more severe or unresponsive cases, surgery is required. The standard surgical approach involves: Enterotomy (making an incision into the bowel) and irrigation with warm saline or 4% N-acetylcysteine to flush out meconium pellets. The bowel is then closed after complete evacuation of the meconium. If necessary, meconium pellets may be manually pushed into the large bowel. For critically ill patients, Bishop-Koop Operation: a proximal dilated bowel segment is resected and anastomosed (connected) to the distal collapsed ileum - ileostomy is done and is later closed when the patient's condition stabilizes. Santulli Operation: Proximal ileum is brought out as an ileostomy for irrigation, while the distal ileum is sutured to the proximal ileum through an end-to-side anastomosis . Sigmoid volvulus (Option B) occurs in older children, adolescents, or adults. It generally causes progressive abdominal distension, vomiting, and constipation, but it is not associated with the failure to pass meconium within the first 48 hours of life. Duodenal atresia (Option C) typically presents with bilious vomiting within the first few hours after birth, often associated with conditions like Down syndrome. Obstruction occurs proximally in the duodenum and is not associated with delayed meconium passage. Midgut volvulus (Option D) usually presents with bilious vomiting , abdominal pain, and signs of bowel ischemia. The hallmark of midgut volvulus is bilious vomiting rather than failure to pass stool and presents with more acute symptoms.",

In this case, the patient is symptomatic with progressive dyspnea, indicating the need for surgical intervention. Plication of the diaphragm is the most appropriate management. Types of eventration: 1. Congenital: Present at birth, often due to incomplete muscularization 2. Acquired: Secondary to phrenic nerve injury, neuromuscular disorders, or trauma Treatment depends on the severity of symptoms: Asymptomatic cases: Observation and follow-up Symptomatic cases: Surgical intervention Surgical options: Plication of the diaphragm: The most common surgical approach Involves folding and suturing the thinned diaphragm to reduce its surface area and lower its position Can be done via open thoracotomy or minimally invasive techniques (thoracoscopy or laparoscopy) Mesh reinforcement: Used in cases with severe thinning or small defects Observation and follow-up (Option A) is incorrect as the patient is symptomatic and requires intervention. Mesh repair (Option C) is incorrect as there is no defect mentioned, only thinning and displacement. Pneumoperitoneum (Option D) induction is incorrect as this is not a standard treatment for diaphragmatic eventration.",

      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: A) Intralobar pulmonary sequestration Explanation: In this case, the patient's age (20 years), presentation with hemoptysis, and CT findings of a lesion within the lung parenchyma with systemic arterial supply are all consistent with intralobar pulmonary sequestration . Pulmonary sequestration is a congenital malformation where a segment of lung tissue is separated from the normal bronchial tree and receives its blood supply from systemic circulation, typically the descending thoracic aorta . There are two types of pulmonary sequestration: Intralobar sequestration (ILS) Extralobar sequestration (ELS) More common (75-90% of cases) Located within normal lung tissue Shares pleural covering with the normal lung Usually diagnosed in adolescents or young adults Common symptoms: recurrent pneumonia, hemoptysis Venous drainage is typically to the pulmonary veins Less common (10-25% of cases) Separate from normal lung tissue with its own pleural covering Usually diagnosed in infancy or early childhood Often associated with other congenital anomalies Venous drainage is typically to the systemic veins (Azygos, Hemiazygos vein, Venacava) Extralobar pulmonary sequestration (Option B) is incorrect as ELS is usually diagnosed earlier in life and is less likely to present with hemoptysis. Bronchogenic cyst (Option C) is incorrect as these are fluid-filled cysts without systemic arterial supply. Congenital cystic adenomatoid malformation (Option D) is incorrect as these typically do not have a systemic arterial supply and present differently on imaging.",
