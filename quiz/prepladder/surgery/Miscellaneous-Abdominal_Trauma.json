      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "viscus. Correct Answer: B) FAST is reliable for assessing retroperitoneum and detecting injuries to hollow viscus. Explanation: FAST is not reliable for assessing the retroperitoneum or accurately detecting injuries to hollow viscus and solid organs. FAST (Focused Abdominal Sonography for Trauma) and eFAST (Extended FAST) : Purpose : Assess for free fluid in the abdominal cavity, thoracic cavities, and pericardium. Nature of Injury : Not used to determine the specific nature or extent of injury. (Option D ruled out) Advantages : Rapid, reproducible, portable, and non-invasive bedside test. Can be performed simultaneously with resuscitation. Accurate at detecting >100 mL of free blood. (Option A ruled out) Limitations : Operator-dependent and may be unreliable in obese patients or when the bowel is full of gas. Low sensitivity (29–35%) for detecting hollow viscus or solid organ injuries without haemoperitoneum. Unreliable for excluding injuries in penetrating trauma. Requires repeat or supplementary investigations if needed. Unreliable for assessing retroperitoneum. Diagnostic Peritoneal Lavage (DPL): Purpose : Assess for the presence of blood or contaminants in the abdomen, valuable in resource-limited settings. (Option C ruled out) Procedure : Nasogastric tube and urinary catheter placement. Cannula insertion below the umbilicus for aspiration and fluid infusion. The positive result is if Frank blood or contaminants are present, or If laboratory results show >100,000 red cells/µL or >500 white cells/µL or Amylase levels in the fluid of more than 175 IU/dl. Drainage of lavage fluid via a chest drain indicates diaphragm penetration. Limitations : Largely replaced by eFAST but remains the standard in some settings where eFAST is unavailable or unreliable.

      "explanation": "Correct answer: C) CT scan with IV contrast Explanation: CT scan with IV contrast is a detailed imaging modality that provides high-resolution images of abdominal organs and blood vessels. It is considered the gold standard for diagnosing blunt abdominal trauma in stable patients, and accurately identifying organ injuries, active bleeding, and other critical conditions. FAST (Focused Assessment with Sonography for Trauma) (Option A): It is a rapid bedside ultrasound technique to detect free fluid in the abdomen in unstable patients, indicating possible haemorrhage. It is beneficial for initial assessment in emergency settings but has limitations, such as missing bowel or retroperitoneal injuries. Diagnostic Peritoneal Lavage (DPL) (Option B): An invasive procedure useful in detecting internal bleeding, it is less commonly employed today, especially in stable patients, due to its invasive nature and limited ability to detect specific organ injuries. Plain abdominal X-ray (Option D): X-ray is not sensitive enough to detect most injuries from blunt abdominal trauma, making it less valuable in acute trauma assessment compared to other imaging options like CT scans or ultrasound.

        "D": "Obtain a CT scan with IV contrast"
      },
      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Correct answer: C) Urgent exploratory laparotomy Explanation: In cases of penetrating abdominal trauma , especially in a patient who is hemodynamically unstable with clinical signs of peritonitis, immediate exploratory laparotomy is the most appropriate step. Surgery allows for direct visualisation and control of any haemorrhage, repair of organ injuries, and management of contamination from gastrointestinal perforations. Perform a FAST scan (Option A): FAST can detect free fluid in the abdomen, which might suggest internal bleeding. However, in a patient who is hemodynamically unstable and shows clear signs of peritonitis (e.g., guarding, rigidity), the time spent performing a FAST scan could delay urgent surgical intervention, which is critical in such cases. Start fluid resuscitation and obtain an abdominal X-ray (Option B): Fluid resuscitation is essential, but an abdominal X-ray is inadequate for assessing penetrating abdominal trauma. In this unstable patient with signs of peritonitis, delaying surgery for imaging could worsen the condition. Obtain a CT scan with IV contrast (Option D): It is done in stable patients. In this scenario, where the patient is unstable with clear signs of significant internal injury, the need for immediate surgery outweighs the benefits of further imaging.",

      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Correct answer: B) Non-operative management with close monitoring in ICU Explanation: For hemodynamically stable patients with minor splenic injuries , non-operative management (NOM) is the preferred approach. This involves admission to the ICU for close monitoring, with repeated clinical assessments and possibly serial imaging to ensure there is no progression of injury or delayed bleeding. The goal is to preserve the spleen, thus avoiding the complications associated with splenectomy, such as OPSI (Overwhelming post-splenectomy infection) American Association for the Surgery of Trauma - AAST Spleen Injury scale Grade I (Minor Injury): Subcapsular hematoma affects less than 10% of the splenic surface area. Capsular tear that is less than 1 cm in depth without active bleeding. Grade II: Subcapsular hematoma involving 10-50% of the splenic surface area. Intraparenchymal hematoma less than 5 cm in diameter. Laceration between 1 and 3 cm in depth that doesn't involve trabecular vessels. Grade III: Subcapsular hematoma covering more than 50% of the splenic surface area or expanding hematoma. Intraparenchymal hematoma greater than 5 cm or expanding. Laceration more than 3 cm in depth or involving trabecular vessels. Grade IV: Laceration affects segmental or hilar vessels, with evidence of devascularization involving more than 25% of the spleen. Injury to the splenic parenchyma that results in major blood loss. Any injury in the presence of splenic vascular injury or active bleeding within the splenic capsule Grade V (Severe Injury): Completely shattered spleen. Vascular injury involving the splenic hilum that results in complete devascularization of the spleen. Immediate splenectomy (Option A): Reserved for hemodynamically unstable patients or those where non-operative management fails. Exploratory laparotomy (Option C): This approach is usually reserved for patients who are hemodynamically unstable despite resuscitation or those who have ongoing signs of internal bleeding that cannot be controlled non-operatively. Angiography with embolization (Option D): It is often used in conjunction with non-operative management. It is not indicated as the immediate next step in a stable patient without signs of active bleeding or vascular injury on the initial CT scan.

      "question": "During liver trauma surgery, the Pringle manoeuvre is performed to control bleeding. Which of the following structures is occluded during this manoeuvre?",
      "options": {
        "A": "Hepatic artery",
        "B": "Portal vein",
        "C": "Both the hepatic artery and portal vein",
        "D": "Bile duct"
      },
      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Correct answer: C) Both the hepatic artery and portal vein Explanation: The Pringle manoeuvre occludes both the hepatic artery and the portal vein within the portal triad. It involves applying a non-crushing vascular clamp to the porta hepatis to block the hepatic artery and portal vein. If this reduces the bleeding, the haemorrhage is likely from the hepatic inflow vessels. However, if bleeding persists despite the manoeuvre, it suggests injury to the hepatic veins or the retrohepatic inferior vena cava (IVC). Bile duct(Option D): The bile duct is part of the portal triad, but it is not occluded during the Pringle manoeuvre. The manoeuvre is designed to control blood flow, not bile flow, so this option is incorrect. A merican Association for the Surgery of Trauma - AAST Liver Injury scale Grade I (Minor Injury) Subcapsular hematoma covers less than 10% of the liver surface area. A laceration of less than 1 cm deep without significant parenchymal disruption. Grade II Subcapsular hematoma covering 10-50% of the liver surface area. Intraparenchymal hematoma less than 10 cm in diameter. Laceration between 1-3 cm deep and less than 10 cm in length. Grade III Subcapsular hematoma covers more than 50% of the liver surface area or ruptured hematoma. Intraparenchymal hematoma greater than 10 cm Laceration deeper than 3 cm. Vascular injury with active bleeding contained within liver parenchyma Grade IV Parenchymal disruption involving 25-75% of a hepatic lobe or affecting 1-3 liver segments. Active bleeding extends beyond the liver into the peritoneal cavity. Grade V (Severe Injury) Parenchymal disruption affects more than 75% of the hepatic lobe.

      "question": "A 40 y/o male presents to the emergency after a high-speed motorcycle collision. He is hemodynamically stable but reports severe, diffuse abdominal pain. On examination, there is significant tenderness in the upper abdomen, but no guarding or rebound tenderness is noted. Which of the following findings on the CT scan would most strongly suggest a duodenal injury?",
      "options": {
        "A": "Free air in the retroperitoneum",
        "B": "Liver laceration with intra-abdominal free fluid",
        "C": "Large splenic hematoma with peri splenic fluid collection",
        "D": "Moderate free fluid in the pelvis without solid organ injury"
      },
      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "Correct answer: A) Free air in the retroperitoneum Explanation: Free air in the retroperitoneum is the most direct and specific indicator of duodenal injury, typically resulting from a perforation in the duodenum. Any gas or fluid collection in the periduodenal tissue is suggestive of injury to the duodenum. Duodenal wall thickening and contrast extravasation are also findings of duodenal injury. Management: Non-Operative Management (NOM) : Suitable for hemodynamically stable patients with minor injuries , such as isolated duodenal hematomas without perforation. Involves bowel rest, intravenous fluids, and antibiotic therapy. Operative Management : Indicated for severe duodenal injuries, hemodynamic instability, or when non-operative management fails. Surgical techniques vary depending on the injury’s severity and location: Primary Repair: Suturing defects in the duodenum. Roux-en-Y reconstruction: For the longer segment of duodenal injuries. Resection and Anastomosis: Removal of the damaged section of the duodenum followed by reconnection of the remaining ends. Duodenal Diverticulization: Creation of a controlled fistula in complex injuries. Pancreaticoduodenectomy (Whipple Procedure): Reserved for severe cases involving the pancreatic head and duodenum. Liver laceration with intra-abdominal free fluid (Option B): Liver laceration causing intra-abdominal free fluid is not related to duodenal injury. Large splenic hematoma with peri splenic fluid collection (Option C): It is associated with splenic trauma and does not indicate duodenal injury. Moderate free fluid in the pelvis without solid organ injury (Option D): It is a nonspecific finding that could result from various intra-abdominal injuries. Without direct evidence of retroperitoneal air or duodenal wall thickening, this finding does not specifically suggest a duodenal injury.

      "question": "A 28 y/o male suffers a stab wound to the abdomen. During surgery, an injury to the head of the pancreas is discovered, with the involvement of both the main pancreatic duct and the intrapancreatic bile duct. Which surgical procedure is most appropriate for this injury?",
      "options": {
        "A": "Distal pancreatectomy",
        "B": "Whipple procedure",
        "C": "External drainage alone",
        "D": "Repair of the pancreatic duct without resection"
      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Correct answer: B) Whipple procedure Explanation: A Whipple procedure (pancreaticoduodenectomy) is the appropriate surgical approach for extensive injuries to the head of the pancreas, particularly when both the main pancreatic duct and the intrapancreatic bile duct are involved. This procedure involves the removal of the head of the pancreas along with parts of the stomach, duodenum, and bile duct, addressing the complex injury. It is a definitive surgical option that ensures the damaged pancreatic tissue and associated structures are adequately managed, reducing the risk of severe complications such as fistulas, abscesses, or pancreatitis. AAST Pancreatic Injury Grading Grade I Minor bruising or a superficial tear of the pancreas without involving the ductal system. Grade II Significant bruising or a laceration of the pancreas, without ductal injury. Grade III Severe injury involving a deep tear or complete transection at the distal end of the pancreas, with damage to the ductal system. Grade IV Extensive injury at the proximal end of the pancreas, involving a deep tear or transection that affects the ampulla and/or the intrapancreatic portion of the common bile duct. Grade V Extensive damage to the pancreatic head results in a severely fragmented or \"shattered\" pancreas. Distal pancreatectomy (Option A): It is performed for injuries to the body or tail of the pancreas, especially when the injury is to the left of the superior mesenteric vessels. Since the injury, in this case, is to the head of the pancreas and involves critical structures such as the main and intrapancreatic bile duct, a distal pancreatectomy would be insufficient. External drainage alone (Option C): While this is essential to manage pancreatic enzymes and prevent retroperitoneal inflammation, it is insufficient for extensive injuries involving critical ducts in the pancreatic head. Repair of the pancreatic duct without resection (Option D) may be appropriate for less severe injuries where the duct is intact or only mildly damaged.",

      "question": "A 29 y/o male presents to the emergency following a high-speed car crash. He was wearing a seat belt and had a clear seat belt sign across his lower abdomen. He reports increasing abdominal pain and tenderness. Which structure is commonly injured in this scenario?",
      "options": {
        "A": "Mesentery",
        "B": "Liver",
        "C": "Spleen",
        "D": "Bladder"
      },
      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "Correct answer: A) Mesentery Explanation: The mesentery , a fold of tissue that attaches the intestines to the posterior abdominal wall, is particularly vulnerable in seat belt injuries due to the compressive force of the belt across the abdomen. This can lead to mesenteric tears, avulsions, or hematomas, resulting in internal bleeding or ischemia which often require surgical intervention to prevent complications like bowel necrosis. The classical seat belt sign refers to a distinctive pattern of bruising or contusion across the abdomen and chest, resulting from the force of a seat belt during a car accident. This visible mark is a significant indicator of potential underlying injuries, including damage to internal organs like the mesentery, small intestine, or spine. Management of seat belt-related injuries: FAST is a quick and widely available method to detect intraperitoneal fluid or blood. Computed tomography (CT) scanning offers significant advantages by identifying critical details such as extraluminal air or contrast leakage, which can guide the need for surgical intervention. In cases where spinal injury is suspected, imaging of the entire spine should be conducted to rule out fractures, such as the Chance fracture commonly associated with seat belt injuries. Treatment: Immediate laparotomy. Seat belt syndrome describes the combination of the seat belt sign with associated internal injuries, such as abdominal organ damage or spinal fractures, particularly in the thoracolumbar region. Liver (Option B): The liver, though a common site of injury in blunt abdominal trauma, is less frequently injured in seat belt injuries compared to the mesentery. Spleen (Option C): The spleen is another organ susceptible to blunt trauma, often resulting in splenic rupture or lacerations. However, in the context of seat belt injuries, the spleen is less commonly affected than the mesentery. Bladder (Option D): Bladder injuries can occur in pelvic fractures or direct trauma to the lower abdomen, but they are not as commonly associated with the seat belt sign as mesenteric injuries.",

      },
      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Correct answer: C) Surgical decompression Explanation: Surgical decompression is indicated for patients with an IAP of 28 cmH I O, which corresponds to Grade III of the Burch Grading System of Intra-abdominal Pressure. This step is necessary to relieve the pressure within the abdominal cavity, preventing further deterioration of organ function and avoiding potentially fatal complications. Abdominal Compartment Syndrome (ACS) is diagnosed when this pressure exceeds 12 mmHg, causing various complications across multiple organ systems. Normal intra-abdominal pressure is around 2-7 mmHg. Causes: Multiple abdominal trauma, postoperative haemorrhages Closure of abdomen under tension, forcible reduction of massive hernia Bowel wall oedema, acute ascites Retroperitoneal hemorrhages, pancreatitis Clinical Features of ACS: Cardiovascular : ↓ Cardiac output, ↓ Venous Return Respiratory : Diaphragmatic elevation restricts lung expansion, causing hypoxia, hypercapnia, respiratory acidosis, and potentially ARDS Renal : ↓ Blood flow to the kidneys, leading to oliguria ( ↓ urine output) and acute kidney injury or renal failure. Gastrointestinal : Mesenteric venous hypertension can cause bowel wall oedema, ischemia, and impaired nutrient absorption. Central Nervous System : ↑ Intracranial pressure can lead to cerebral oedema, hypoxia, and even unconsciousness. Burch Grading System of Intra-abdominal Pressure Grade Pressure (cm of H 2 O) Pressure (mm Hg) Management 1 10-15 12-15 It does not require decompression 2 16-25 16-20 Close monitoring (Option A ruled out) 3 26-35 21-25 Most require decompression 4 >35 >25 All require immediate decompression Treatment: Surgical decompression is the only ideal treatment for ACS. Resuscitative measures to manage hypotension, acidosis and other conditions. Aggressive fluid resuscitation (Option B): In grade III ACS, aggressive fluid resuscitation alone may exacerbate the situation by increasing abdominal pressure further. Administration of diuretics (Option D): Diuretics are often used to manage fluid overload in various conditions, but they are ineffective in treating elevated intra-abdominal pressure caused by ACS.

      "explanation": "Correct Answer: C) Grade III Renal Trauma Explanation: The patient’s CECT scan shows a 3 cm laceration extending into the renal cortex and medulla without vascular injury. According to the AAST grading, this is a Grade III injury (laceration >1 cm deep without vascular involvement). AAST GRADING OF RENAL TRAUMA Grade I Subcapsular hematoma and/or parenchymal contusion without laceration. (Option A ruled out) Grade II Perirenal hematoma. Laceration < 1 cm deep without urinary extravasation. (Option B ruled out) Grade III Laceration > 1 cm deep or renal pedicle injury without urinary extravasation or vascular injury. (Option C) Grade IV Parenchymal laceration extends into the collecting system with urinary extravasation. Segmental renal vein or artery injury. (Option D ruled out) Grade V Main renal artery or vein laceration or avulsion of the hilum. Completely shattered kidney or renal avulsion. Investigations: Contrast-Enhanced Computed Tomography (CECT): The gold standard for diagnosing renal injuries in stable patients with hematuria. Assesses renal and surrounding organ injuries comprehensively. Ultrasonography (USG): Used to detect free fluid . Less effective than CT for renal injury evaluation. Can identify renal lacerations and hematomas, but cannot differentiate between blood and urine. Intravenous Pyelography (IVP): Mostly replaced by CT. Used intraoperatively to confirm contralateral kidney function in unstable patients. Management: Observation: Bed rest, regular monitoring of vital signs, and lab tests. Reimaging: Conduct follow-up imaging if the patient's condition worsens. Minimally Invasive Procedures: Angioembolization: For controlling active bleeding. Endourological Stenting: For managing urine extravasation. Nephrectomy",
