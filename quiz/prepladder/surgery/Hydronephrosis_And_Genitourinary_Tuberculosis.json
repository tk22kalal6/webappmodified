Typically, this procedure is done in the prone position. Fluoroscopy or ultrasound is used for localisation. The posterolateral calyx is commonly chosen for entry. Principle of PCNL: PCNL involves the creation of a small percutaneous tract through the skin, directly accessing the renal collecting system. (Option A ruled out) Using this tract, the surgeon can then remove the stone using various instruments, such as forceps, baskets, or ultrasonic or pneumatic lithotripters. Indications for PCNL: Renal stones larger than 2 cm in diameter Stones resistant to or unsuitable for extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy (ESWL) Stones in anomalous kidneys or in the setting of previous failed stone treatment (Option D ruled out) PCNL is typically performed under general anesthesia and the patient is generally encouraged to ambulate soon after the procedure.

Bladder TB: Infection Progression: The infection spreads from the ureter into the bladder, with an early sign observable during cystoscopy being pallor around the ureteric orifice in the bladder. Chronic Inflammation: This inflammation leads to the formation of tubercles in the bladder, followed by fibrosis. Bladder Changes: The fibrosis results in a small, contracted bladder with significantly reduced capacity, often referred to as a \"thimble bladder.\" Advanced TB: In advanced cases, where the bladder is contracted, the ureteric orifices may appear as \"golf hole\" shapes.

In this case, with no obstruction, the initial approach should be conservative. It is a common complication, occurring in up to 15-20% of cases. The management of Steinstrasse depends on the severity of symptoms and the degree of obstruction. In this case, with intermittent symptoms and no complete obstruction, the initial approach should be conservative. This includes: Increased fluid intake to promote stone fragment passage Administration of alpha-blockers (e.g., tamsulosin) to facilitate ureteric relaxation and stone passage (Option B) Close monitoring with periodic imaging to assess the progress of stone passage If the conservative approach is unsuccessful or the patient develops severe symptoms or complete obstruction, then more invasive interventions, such as ureteroscopy (Option A ruled out) or percutaneous nephrolithotomy (Option D ruled out) , may be considered. Repeat ESWL is the preferred option to further fragment the retained stone pieces (Option C): Steinstrasse is a result of the initial ESWL, and further ESWL may not be effective in clearing the fragments and could potentially worsen the condition.",

      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "fragmentation Correct Answer: C) ESWL can be performed on stones less than 2 cm in diameter for optimal fragmentation Explanation: While smaller stones (typically less than 2 cm) generally respond better to extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy (ESWL), the procedure can be performed on stones up to 3-4 cm in diameter with appropriate patient selection and treatment parameters. Principles of Extracorporeal Shock Wave Lithotripsy (ESWL): Shock Wave Generation: (Option A ruled out) ESWL utilizes high-energy shock waves generated outside the body. These shock waves are focused on the location of the stone using imaging guidance (e.g., ultrasound, fluoroscopy). Stone Fragmentation: The focused shock waves create a rapid change in pressure at the stone's surface. This pressure change causes the stone to fracture into smaller fragments. Indications for ESWL: Radiolucent or radiopaque renal or ureteric stones less than 2 cm in diameter Stones located in the renal pelvis, upper, or middle ureter Patients with normal renal function and no severe hydronephrosis Contraindications to ESWL: Pregnancy Bleeding disorders or anticoagulant therapy Uncontrolled urinary tract infection Severe skeletal deformities or obesity (Option B ruled out) Distal ureteric obstruction Solitary kidney or severe renal impairment Patients are generally encouraged to ambulate soon after ESWL to facilitate the passage of the fragmented stones.

      "correct_answer": "D",
      "explanation": "renal stones Correct Answer: D) Radionuclide scans can distinguish between obstructing and non-obstructing renal stones Explanation: Radionuclide scans can distinguish between obstructing and non-obstructing renal stones. Radionuclide scans, such as technetium- 99m mercaptoacetyltriglycine (MAG3) or diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid (DTPA) scans, are useful in the evaluation of renal stones when other imaging modalities are inconclusive. Radionuclide scans assess renal function and the degree of obstruction, which can help differentiate between obstructing and non-obstructing stones. Obstructing stones will typically show delayed or decreased tracer accumulation in the affected kidney, indicating impaired drainage. Non-obstructing stones may not cause significant changes in the radionucleotide scan. Radionuclide scans are especially helpful in patients with inconclusive findings on ultrasonography or plain radiography, as well as in those with impaired renal function. Radionuclide scans are more sensitive than intravenous pyelography (IVP) in detecting obstruction and can provide valuable information on renal function. Technetium-99m dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) scan is the preferred modality to diagnose renal stones (Option A): DMSA scans are used to evaluate renal parenchymal abnormalities, such as renal scarring. They are not the preferred modality for diagnosing renal stones. Gallium-67 citrate scan has higher sensitivity and specificity than DMSA scan for detecting renal stones (Option B): Gallium-67 citrate scans are more commonly used for the detection of certain infections and malignancies. Radionuclide scans are exclusively reserved for patients with impaired renal function (Option C): While radionuclide scans can be particularly useful in patients with impaired renal function, they are not exclusively reserved for these patients .

      "options": {
        "A": "Kidney, Ureter, and Bladder X-ray",

        "D": "Intravenous urogram"
      },
      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: C) Non-contrast computed tomography (NCCT) Explanation: Non-contrast computed tomography (NCCT) is considered the gold standard for diagnosing renal stones. NCCT scans provide detailed images of the urinary tract and can identify both radiopaque (visible on X-rays) and radiolucent (not easily visible on X-rays) stones. Investigations for renal stones: Urinalysis: This is often the initial investigation performed. It can reveal the presence of blood (hematuria), white blood cells (pyuria), and crystals in the urine, all suggestive of a possible stone. The pH of the urine can also give clues about the type of stone. Kidney, Ureter, and Bladder (KUB) X-ray : It can detect some types of stones, particularly calcium-containing stones, which appear opaque on X-rays. (Option A ruled out) Ultrasound : It's particularly useful for detecting hydronephrosis (swelling of the kidney due to urine blockage) caused by stones and can be helpful during pregnancy when minimizing radiation exposure is important. (Option B ruled out) Intravenous urogram (IVU): It involves injecting a contrast dye into a vein. The dye travels through the bloodstream to the kidneys, where it is filtered and excreted in the urine. X-rays are taken as the dye passes through the urinary tract, outlining the kidneys, ureters, and bladder. This test can reveal blockages in the urinary tract caused by stones.

      "question": "A 35-year-old woman presents with recurrent urinary tract infections (UTIs), persistent back pain, and hematuria. Imaging reveals a large, branched stone occupying a significant portion of her right kidney. Urinalysis shows alkaline pH, the presence of bacteria, and crystals as shown below. Which of the following is the most likely composition of this stone?",
      "options": {
        "A": "Calcium oxalate",
        "B": "Uric acid",
        "C": "Struvite",
        "D": "Cystine"
      },
      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: C) Struvite Explanation: Struvite (Magnesium Ammonium Phosphate): Found only in alkaline urine. Appears as coffin-lid-shaped crystals and is always associated with urinary infections. Calcium Oxalate (Option A ruled out): Shapes include envelopes, spindles, ovals, octahedral, picket fences, or dumbbell-shaped. Often feature an \"X\" in the center. Calcium Phosphate: Colorless crystals that appear as plates, stars, stellate shapes, or clusters of needles or rosettes. Typically found in more alkaline urine. Cystine (Option D ruled out): Crystals are hexagonal in shape and resemble nearly perfect benzene rings under the microscope. Uric Acid (Option B ruled out): Crystals can be rhomboidal-shaped, rosettes, or plates. Found in acidic urine with a pH of 5.5 or lower.",

      "question": "A 42-year-old male presents to the emergency department with severe abdominal pain. Imaging reveals that he has a renal stone lodged in the middle third of his ureter. He describes the pain as radiating to his hypogastrium. Which nerve is responsible for the radiation of pain to the hypogastrium?",
      "options": {
        "A": "Ilioinguinal Nerve",
        "B": "Iliohypogastric Nerve",
        "C": "Genitofemoral Nerve",
        "D": "Femoral Nerve"
      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: B) Iliohypogastric Nerve Explanation: The iliohypogastric nerve is responsible for sensation in the iliac fossa, hypogastrium, and groin area. It mediates the pain radiation from stones located in the middle third of the ureter . Clinical features of renal stones: Abdominal pain: Most common presentation Hematuria : Presence of blood in the urine, which can be visible (gross hematuria) or detected only under a microscope (microscopic hematuria). Urinary Symptoms : Dysuria Frequency Urgency Nocturia Nausea and Vomiting Causes of pain in renal stones: Obstruction: Causes stretching of the renal capsule, leading to non-colicky abdominal pain. Stone fragment in ureter: Causes hyperperistalsis of the ureter, resulting in colicky pain. Pain radiation: Depends on the location of the stone. Upper 1/3 of the ureter: Testis in males. Labia majora in females. Middle 1/3 of the ureter: Iliac fossa, hypogastrium, and groin (via the iliohypogastric nerve). On the right side , this pain can mimic acute appendicitis as it radiates to the right iliac fossa. On the left side , this pain can mimic diverticulitis as it radiates to the left iliac fossa. Lower 1/3 of the Ureter: Scrotum, perineum, and the inner aspect of the thigh ( via the ilioinguinal nerve) . Reference: Bailey and Love Short Practice of Surgery, 28th Edition, Page 1475-1476",

      "question": "A 50-year-old man with a history of HIV, on ART, presents to the emergency department with severe flank pain, hematuria, and difficulty urinating. Recent imaging studies reveal the presence of renal stones. Which of the following ART drugs is commonly associated with the development of renal stones?",
      "options": {
        "A": "Indinavir",
        "B": "Efavirenz",
        "C": "Nevirapine",
        "D": "None of the above"
      },
      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: A) Indinavir Explanation: Indinavir is a protease inhibitor that has proven highly effective in boosting CD4+ cell counts and reducing HIV-RNA levels in patients with HIV and AIDS. However, patients taking indinavir are at a notable risk of developing urolithiasis. Drug-induced stones: Triamterene: Excessive use of this potassium-sparing diuretic can lead to the formation of radiolucent stones. Indinavir: This protease inhibitor used in HIV treatment can also cause the formation of radiolucent stones. Silicate Stones: These stones can form due to excessive consumption of antacids containing silica. Radiolucent Stones caused by: (mnemonic: TIXU) T – Triamterene I – Indinavir X – Xanthine U – Uric acid Efavirenz (Option B) and Nevirapine (Option C) : They are a component of the ART (Antiretroviral therapy) regimen and are not known to be involved in the formation of renal stones.
