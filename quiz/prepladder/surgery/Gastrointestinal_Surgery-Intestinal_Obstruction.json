        "D": "Resection and anastomosis are appropriate treatments for Crohn's disease"
      },
      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: C) A collapsed caecum during laparotomy suggests a large bowel obstruction. caecum is indicative of a large bowel obstruction. Management of Large Bowel Obstruction: Surgical Management: Malignant Lesions: Resectable Lesions: Perform emergency right hemicolectomy with primary anastomosis if the patient's condition allows. Non-Resectable Lesions: Consider proximal stoma (colostomy or ileostomy) or ileo-transverse bypass. Splenic Flexure Obstruction: Extended right hemicolectomy with ileo-descending anastomosis. Left Colon or Rectosigmoid Junction Obstruction: Immediate resection unless contraindicated. Emergency Procedures: Imminent Perforation: Perform emergency caecostomy or loop colostomy/ileostomy to stabilize the patient. (Option B) Intraoperative Considerations: Colostomy: Often performed if the distal bowel cannot be closed; Hartmann’s procedure if the distal bowel is not suitable for closure. Anastomosis: Consider using proximal colon if feasible, with on-table colonic lavage for decompression and cleaning. Palliative and Preoperative Stenting: Self-Expanding Metal Stent: Preferred in palliative care. Stenting as a Bridge to Surgery: Recommended for potentially curable left-sided colon cancer. Alternative to Stenting: Decompressing Stoma: If colonic stenting is not feasible Adhesions: Perform adhesiolysis. Malignancy: Resection and anastomosis (for peritoneal carcinomatosis) Hernia: Perform reduction Crohn's Disease: Resection and anastomosis (Option D) Laparotomy Findings: Distended Caecum: Indicates large bowel obstruction. (Option A) Collapsed Caecum: Indicates small bowel obstruction. Reference: Bailey & Love's Short Practice of Surgery, 28th Edition, Page 1389.",

      "question": "A 45-year-old patient with a history of previous abdominal surgeries presents with severe abdominal pain that initially started as crampy but has become constant and steady. The patient has a temperature of 102 degrees, 128 beats per minute heart rate, and elevated white blood cell count. Which diagnostic test is most appropriate for confirming in this patient?",
      "options": {
        "A": "Abdominal X-ray",
        "B": "CECT",
        "C": "USG abdomen",
        "D": "MRI abdomen"
      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: B) CECT Explanation: This is a case of strangulating obstruction , characterized by constant, steady pain, fever, tachycardia, and elevated white blood cell count. Given the patient’s history of previous abdominal surgeries, there is a risk of adhesions leading to strangulation. Contrast-enhanced CT (CECT) is the most appropriate diagnostic test to confirm this condition, as it provides detailed images that help identify bowel ischemia and assess vascular compromise effectively. Simple obstruction and Strangulating obstruction Feature Simple Obstruction Strangulating Obstruction Definition Mechanical obstruction with intact blood supply. Mechanical obstruction with compromised blood supply. Pain Crampy, colicky pain. Constant, steady pain. Systemic Symptoms Typically absent or mild. Fever, tachycardia, and elevated white blood cell count. Diagnostic Tests Abdominal X-ray (initial assessment). Contrast-Enhanced CT (CECT). Contrast-Enhanced CT (CECT) for detailed evaluation. Additional Features Usually no systemic signs of infection or inflammation. Systemic signs of infection (e.g., fever) and inflammation. Management Can be managed with conservative treatment or surgery if necessary. Requires urgent surgical intervention to address ischemia and restore blood flow . Abdominal X-ray (Option A) : Not sufficient for confirming strangulation or assessing bowel ischemia. USG abdomen (Option C) : Less effective at detecting detailed features of strangulation. MRI abdomen (Option D) : Not the first choice for diagnosing bowel obstructions or strangulation. Reference: Bailey & Love's Short Practice of Surgery, 28th Edition, Page 1376.",

      "question": "A 55-year-old female patient presents with a history of abdominal surgery performed 3 days ago. She reports worsening abdominal distension and has not passed stool since the surgery. On examination her abdomen is distended, and bowel sounds are absent. Which of the following statements is correct regarding this condition?",
      "options": {
        "A": "Caused by increased peristaltic activity.",
        "B": "Surgery is the first-line treatment.",
        "C": "X-ray shows dilated bowel loops and air-fluid levels",
        "D": "Associated with hyperkalemia."
      },
      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: C) X-ray shows dilated bowel loops and air-fluid levels Explanation: This presentation is consistent with paralytic ileus, a condition where impaired peristaltic activity results in decreased bowel motility. The absence of bowel sounds and abdominal distension, combined with a history of recent abdominal surgery, supports this diagnosis. An abdominal X-ray typically reveals dilated bowel loops and multiple air-fluid levels, which are characteristic findings in paralytic ileus. Paralytic Ileus Characterized by: Impaired intestinal motility due to failure of peristaltic wave transmission. Collection of food and fluid in the bowel (Option A). Abdominal distension . Type: Adynamic obstruction. Etiology Abdominal surgery. Uremia. Mesenteric ischemia. Retroperitoneal hematoma. Intra-abdominal sepsis. Dyselectrolytemia (e.g., hypokalemia) (Option D). Drugs affecting intestinal motility: Opiates. Antipsychotics. Pathophysiology Neurogenic- enteric nervous system and CNS Inflammatory- histamine, IL-6 and IL-8, monocytes and macrophages Enteric hormones and neuropeptides- motilin, substance P, and vasoactive intestinal peptide [VIP] Perioperative electrolyte disturbances Opioids Duration of surgery and extent of surgical trauma Clinical Features Abdominal distension. Abdominal discomfort. Non-colicky pain. Vomiting. Non-passage of feces and flatus. Absence of bowel sounds. Investigations IOC: Abdominal X-ray. (Option C) Findings: Dilated bowel loops. Gas in the colon and rectum. Multiple air-fluid levels. Management Decompression: Nasogastric aspiration. Diet: Restrict oral intake until bowel sounds return or the patient starts passing feces and flatus. Treatment of Underlying Cause: Correct dyselectrolytemia (e.g., hypokalemia). Discontinue medications affecting motility (e.g., opiates). Surgery is the first-line treatment (Option B) : The first-line treatment is usually conservative (e.g., nasogastric tube, restricting oral intake).",

        "D": "Coffee bean sign"
      },
      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: A) Target sign Explanation: Intussusception is the most probable diagnosis in this scenario Presents most commonly in children with episodic abdominal pain, lethargy, vomiting, and \"red currant jelly\" stools Target sign is seen in the CT abdomen due to telescoping of one segment of the bowel into another Intussusception: It is telescoping of one segment of the bowel into another Most common age group- 5 to 10 months of age Most common type in adults is colo-colic. Lead point is usually meckel’s diverticulum, polyp, malignancy etc. Most common type in children is ileocolic. No lead point generally. Parts of Intussusception: Clinical manifestations: Colicky pain Episodes of crying, vomiting (bilious), and drawing up of the legs to the chest The attacks last for a few minutes In between the attacks, the child is asymptomatic Stool mixed with blood and mucus - ‘ redcurrant jelly’ stool On rectal examination, blood-stained mucus may be found on the finger On per abdomen examination: Sausage-shaped lump with concavity towards the umbilicus Emptiness in right iliac fossa- the sign of Dance Investigations: USG is the IOC in children and CECT is the IOC in adults. Barium enema: Claw sign (Option B) Coiled spring sign (Option C) Ultrasound/CT: Target /donut/ bull’s eye sign- transverse view (Option A) Pseudokidney sign- longitudinal view X-ray abdomen: Multiple air-fluid levels suggestive of bowel obstruction Treatment: Resuscitation with intravenous fluids, broad-spectrum antibiotics and nasogastric drainage Air or barium enema reduction Surgical reduction if radiological reduction fails Resection and primary anastomosis in irreducible intussusception Coffee bean sign (Option D): It is seen on an X-ray abdomen in a case of sigmoid volvulus.",

        "D": "Osmotic laxatives"
      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: B) Neostigmine Explanation: Neostigmine is a parasympathomimetic drug , which is the preferred treatment in colonic pseudo-obstruction It causes strong colonic peristalsis that usually leads to subsequent flatus and bowel movements Colonic Pseudo-Obstruction (Ogilvie’s syndrome): It is massive dilatation of the colon with obstructive symptoms but in the absence of mechanical obstruction. Risk factors: Frailty and senility Neurological Neurodegenerative diseases Stroke Spinal cord injury Retroperitoneum tumour infiltration Trauma/Surgical Major orthopaedic injuries or surgery involving vertebral, pelvic, and femoral Major gynaecological surgery Obstetrics, including caesarean section Systemic inflammation due to sepsis, trauma, multiorgan failure Localised infections in the respiratory system, urinary tract Myocardial infarction Metabolic and electrolyte disturbances Medications like opioids and any with anticholinergic actions (e.g. psychiatric and Parkinson’s), calcium channel antagonists Clinical manifestations: Abdominal distension, discomfort Tympanic percussion, sluggish bowel sounds, and non-tender Investigations: X-ray abdomen: Colonic dilatation Definitive investigation- CT Treatment: Correction of risk factors: Correct fluid and electrolyte imbalance factors Stop offending drugs like opioids, anticholinergics, and calcium channel blockers Empty the rectum by enemas and/or flatus tube Endoscopic decompression: Colonoscopy +/– flatus tube Pharmacological treatment: Intravenous neostigmine (Option B) Contraindicated in: Arrhythmia Bronchospasm Surgery: Subtotal colectomy with ileostomy Stimulant laxatives (Option C) and osmotic laxatives (Option D) : They should be avoided as they can worsen colonic dilation.",
