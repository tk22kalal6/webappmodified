      "question": "A 1.5-month-old male infant presents to the outpatient department with vomiting after feeding and failure to thrive . On examination, a firm, olive-shaped mass is palpated in the upper abdomen . What is the most likely diagnosis?",
      "options": {
        "A": "Subacute Intestinal Obstruction",
        "B": "Pyloric Stenosis",
        "C": "GERD",
        "D": "Esophageal Atresia"
      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "hypertrophic pyloric stenosis (IHPS) . The presence of a firm, olive-shaped mass in the epigastric region (hypertrophied pylorus) is a classic finding. Failure to thrive occurs due to chronic vomiting and dehydration . Ultrasound confirms the diagnosis by showing thickened pyloric muscle (>3mm thickness, >14mm length) . Hypertrophic Pyloric Stenosis (HPS) Feature Description Age of Presentation 3-6 weeks of life Symptoms Projectile, non-bilious vomiting Physical Exam Olive-shaped mass in epigastrium Diagnosis Ultrasound: Pyloric muscle hypertrophy Treatment Ramstedt's pyloromyotomy Subacute Intestinal Obstruction (Option A): Incorrect because it typically presents with bilious vomiting and distended abdomen , not an olive-shaped mass . GERD (Option C): Incorrect because GERD causes effortless regurgitation without an olive-shaped mass or projectile vomiting. Esophageal Atresia (Option D): Incorrect because it presents at birth with excessive drooling, choking, and respiratory distress , not progressive vomiting.",

      "question": "An alcoholic male patient diagnosed with hollow viscus perforation is taken up for laparotomy. Intraoperatively, a 2 cm perforation is seen in the duodenal region, as shown below. How can this patient be managed?",
      "options": {
        "A": "Primary closure of the defect",
        "B": "Omental pedicle repair",
        "C": "Billroth I",
        "D": "Billroth II"
      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: B) Omental pedicle repair Explanation: In case of a duodenal perforation , omental pedicle repair is the preferred method of treatment. The omentum , a highly vascular tissue, is mobilised and placed over the perforation. This provides a biological seal and promotes healing while reducing the risk of infection or further leakage. Duodenal ulcer perforation: Common with anterior duodenal ulcers. Presents with an acute abdomen with sudden-onset, severe epigastric pain, rebound tenderness, and air under the diaphragm in the radiograph. Management: Non-surgical: Nil per-oral IV antibiotics and PPIs Surgical: Initial empirical antibiotic treatment. The perforation is approached by a small upper midline incision Perforations <1cm are closed primarily and buttressed with a well-vascularized omentum Larger perforations & with fibrotic edges: Modified Graham's Repair or Omental Patch Repair. The vascularized pedicle of the greater omentum is patched over the defect.",

      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: B) APC, k-ras, p53 Explanation: The genes associated with the development of colorectal carcinoma are APC, k-ras, p53 & SMAD4. Adenoma-Carcinoma Sequence: Accounts for up to 80% of sporadic cancers. APC Gene Mutations: Leads to β -catenin accumulation and Wnt pathway activation. \"First hit\": Sporadic inactivation of APC. \"Second hit\": Loss of second APC copy K-ras Mutations: Promote growth and prevent apoptosis. SMAD2 and SMAD4 Mutations: Disrupt TGF- β pathway, causing uncontrolled proliferation. p53 Mutations: Occur in later stages of tumour progression. colorectal cancer\" data-author=\"\" data-hash=\"12179\" data-license=\"\" data-source=\"\" data-tags=\"May2025\" height=\"210\" src=\"https://image.prepladder.com/notes/0wEnjsz1KsbQFf4gR7Mn1746521428.png\" width=\"500\" /> Fearon and Vogelstein's model for the development of colorectal cancer APC, BRCA, k-ras (Option A): BRCA mutations are more commonly associated with breast and ovarian cancers, not colon cancer. MYh, K-RAS, APC (Option C): MYH-associated polyposis (MAP) is a rare autosomal recessive condition caused by mutations in the MUTYH gene. It can increase the risk of colorectal cancer, but MUTYH gene mutations are not directly associated with colon cancer. MYH, p53, DCC (Option D): MYH-associated polyposis (MAP) is a rare autosomal recessive condition caused by mutations in the MUTYH gene. It can increase the risk of colorectal cancer, but MUTYH gene mutations are not directly associated with colon cancer.",

      "explanation": "Correct Answer: A) 1 Explanation: Mandatory exploration is generally required for injuries in Zone 1 of the retroperitoneum. Zones of retroperitoneum Zones 1 2 3 Location Central Lateral Pelvic (retroperitoneal zone of the pelvis) Structures involve The aorta & its proximal branches Inferior vena cava & its proximal tributaries Distal renal vessels Iliac vessels Management (Other options ruled out) Exploration with proximal & distal vascular control Lateral hematoma (renal in origin) - managed nonoperatively (angioembolization) Pulsatile hematoma or penetrating injury present - exploration. Pelvic hematoma is exceptionally difficult to control. Usually, it should not be opened. It is managed by packing/angioembolisation. Explored only if there is expanding or pulsatile or penetrating injury present.

      "question": "Heller's operation is done for____?",
      "options": {
        "A": "Achalasia cardia",
        "B": "Carcinoma esophagus",
        "C": "Esophageal stricture",
        "D": "Hypertrophic pyloric stenosis"
      },
      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "procedure performed to treat Achalasia cardia. Achalasia is a condition characterized by the inability of the lower esophageal sphincter (LES) to relax properly, leading to difficulty in swallowing and the accumulation of food in the esophagus. Heller's operation involves cutting the muscles of the lower esophageal sphincter to alleviate the obstruction and improve the passage of food into the stomach. Incorrect Options: Option B . Carcinoma esophagus: Heller's operation is not performed for carcinoma of the esophagus. Carcinoma esophagus typically requires other treatment modalities such as surgery, chemotherapy, radiation therapy, or a combination of these approaches. Option C . Esophageal stricture: Heller's operation is not commonly performed for esophageal strictures. Esophageal strictures are often managed using other methods such as endoscopic dilation, stent placement, or surgical resection, depending on the underlying cause and severity of the stricture. Option D . Hypertrophic pyloric stenosis: Heller's operation is not indicated for hypertrophic pyloric stenosis. Hypertrophic pyloric stenosis is a condition that affects infants and causes narrowing of the pylorus, leading to projectile vomiting and feeding difficulties. The treatment for hypertrophic pyloric stenosis typically involves a surgical procedure called pyloromyotomy, which involves making an incision in the muscle of the pylorus to relieve the obstruction.",
