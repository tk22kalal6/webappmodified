      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: B) Keloid Explanation: This clinical scenario describes a keloid scar. Key features that distinguish keloids from hypertrophic scars and other conditions include: Keloid Hypertrophic scar (Option A) Extends beyond the original wound margins Continues to grow over time More common in darker skin types Often appears on chest, shoulders, earlobes May be pruritic or painful Does not regress spontaneously Remains within the boundaries of the original wound Develops within weeks of injury May regress over time (usually within a year) More common than keloids Can occur in any skin type May be red, raised, and firm The patient's scar extending beyond the original wound margins, continuing growth after 8 months, and symptoms of pruritus and pain are all consistent with a keloid. Hypertrophic scar (Option A) is incorrect because hypertrophic scars do not extend beyond the original wound margins. Dermatofibroma (Option C) is incorrect as dermatofibromas are typically small, firm nodules that don't arise from surgical scars. Malignant transformation (Option D) is incorrect as malignant transformation of scars is rare and would present differently, typically with ulceration or rapid growth.",

      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: B) Fibroblast activity and collagen production Explanation: The wound-healing process consists of four overlapping phases: 1. Hemostasis: Immediately after injury, platelets aggregate and form a fibrin clot to stop bleeding. (Option A) 2. Inflammatory phase : Neutrophils and macrophages infiltrate the wound, removing debris and bacteria. (Option D) 3. Proliferative phase: This phase is characterized by collagen deposition, angiogenesis (formation of new blood vessels), and granulation tissue formation. (Option B) 4. Remodeling phase: The final phase involves collagen reorganization and wound contraction. (Option C) Reference: Sabiston Textbook of Surgery, 21st Edition, Page120",

      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: B) Class II Explanation: Cholecystectomy will be categorized under Class II (clean-contaminated wound) as it is an operative wound involving the gastrointestinal tract under controlled conditions. The surgical classification of wounds includes four categories: 1. Class I - Clean (Option A) : Uninfected operative wounds without inflammation. Respiratory, alimentary, genital, or urinary tracts are not entered. Examples: Inguinal hernia operation, mastectomy, thyroidectomy. 2. Class II - Clean-contaminated (Option B) : Operative wounds in which the respiratory tract, gastrointestinal tract, or genitourinary tract are entered under controlled conditions without unusual contamination. Examples: Cholecystectomy, elective GI surgery. 3. Class III - Contaminated (Option C) : Open, fresh accidental wounds, operations with major breaks in sterile techniques or gross spillage from the GIT, and incisions with acute, non-purulent inflammation. Examples: Appendicular perforation, gastric perforation. 4. Class IV - Dirty (Option D) : Old traumatic wounds with retained devitalized tissue, wounds with clinical infection, or perforated viscera. Examples: Perforated diverticulitis, fecal peritonitis. Reference: Sabiston Textbook of Surgery, 21st Edition, Page 225",

      },
      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: C) Prolonged use of postoperative drains Explanation: Prolonged use of postoperative drains can actually increase the risk of SSIs by providing a potential route for bacterial entry. Surgical site infections (SSIs) are a significant cause of postoperative morbidity. Prevention strategies include: 1. Preoperative measures: Chlorhexidine showers, proper hair removal (clipping instead of shaving), and optimizing patient factors (e.g., glycemic control). 2. Intraoperative measures: Proper hand hygiene and surgical scrubbing, appropriate skin preparation, maintaining normothermia, and proper surgical technique. 3. Antibiotic prophylaxis: Administering appropriate antibiotics within 60 minutes before incision and redosing for long procedures. 4. Postoperative care: Early removal of urinary catheters and proper wound care. Several specific measures that can help prevent surgical site infections: Staff should follow hand washing between patients (Option B) Length of hospital stay should be kept minimum (to prevent hospital-acquired infections) (Option A) Preoperative shaving should be avoided if possible to minimize minor cuts Antibiotic skin preparation should be standardized Bowel preparation for intra-abdominal surgery should be followed Best time to give preoperative antibiotics: At the time of induction via IV route or 1 hour before surgery (Option D) Attention to theater technique & discipline Avoid hypothermia pre-operatively Monofilament sutures should be preferred over polyfilament sutures (Increased risk of infection in polyfilament) Proper apposition of the wound during suturing Prevention of dead space & hematoma.

      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: B) Secondary intention Explanation: Wound healing can occur by different mechanisms: 1. Healing by primary intention or first intention (Option A) : Edges of a clean wound are brought together and secured with sutures, staples, or adhesives. Minimal scarring occurs. 2. Healing by secondary intention (Option B) : The wound is left open to heal by granulation, contraction, and epithelialization. This is common in wounds with significant tissue loss or contamination. 3. Healing by tertiary intention (delayed primary closure) (Option C & D) : The wound is initially left open and then closed surgically after several days when it's clean and granulating. This is used for contaminated wounds to prevent infection. In the given scenario, the large, open wound left to heal naturally without surgical closure is healing by secondary intention.",

      "explanation": "viable tissue around the wound Correct Answer: C) Characteristic Morel-LavallÃ©e lesion can be seen due to edema of surrounding viable tissue around the wound Explanation: The clinical scenario according to the presentation and image is indicative of Degloving Injury. Morel-LavallÃ©e lesion, seen in degloving injury, occurs due to disruption of perforating vascular and lymphatic vessels causing hemo-lymphatic collection between the fascial planes. Degloving Injury Definition Degloving injuries are serious traumatic injuries occuring due to shearing force between tissue planes, usually between subcutaneous tissue and deep fascia or between muscle and bone. (Option A) Pathophysiology Avulsion due to shearing force strips off the superficial tissues exposing the neurovascular bundle, muscles, tendons, and bone .

      "question": "A 25-year-old man is brought to the emergency department following a motorcycle accident. He has a closed fracture of the right tibia and complains of severe pain in his right lower leg. On examination, there is pain on passive stretching of the affected limb and distal sensory disturbances are noted. The emergency physician suspects compartment syndrome. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in the management of this patient?",

        "D": "Administration of intravenous antibiotics"
      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: B) Measurement of compartment pressure Explanation: The next best step after suspecting compartment syndrome in the given patient, is to measure the compartment pressure by using a pressure monitor and catheter inserted into the muscle compartment. If pressure is greater than 30 mm Hg then diagnosis of compartment syndrome is confirmed, warranting further measures. Compartment Syndrome Definition â€¢ Common in the anterior compartment of the leg and in front of the forearm. â€¢ Because of the closed compartment, pressure increases following fracture, haematoma develops which compresses over the vessel. â€¢ Leads to blockade of vessels causing acute ischaemia of the limb presenting with severe pain, pallor, pulselessness. Clinical Features â€¢ Severe pain â€¢ Pain on passive stretching of affected limb â€¢ Distal sensory disturbances â€¢ Absence of distal pulses (late sign) Investigation â€¢ Compartment pressure is measured â€¢ Pressure monitor & catheter inserted into muscle compartment â€¢ Diagnosis confirmed if pressure is greater than 30 mm Hg Treatment Fasciotomy: â€¢ Indication: If compartment pressure is > 30 mmHg â€¢ Clinical signs and symptoms of compartment syndrome Procedure â€¢ Two longitudinal incisions should be given â€“ one on the medial and the other on the lateral side â€¢ Incised layers are: Skin Subcutaneous fat Fascia â€¢ After incision, the muscle should be bulging through the fascia Immediate fasciotomy without further investigation (Option A): While the clinical signs are suggestive, the diagnosis should be confirmed by measuring compartment pressure before proceeding to surgery. Applying a compression bandage (Option C) could potentially worsen compartment syndrome by increasing pressure within the compartment. While antibiotics (Option D) might be considered for an open fracture, they are not the primary management for compartment syndrome, and the scenario describes a closed fracture.",

        "D": "Flap reconstruction"
      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: B) Application of hydrocolloid dressing Explanation: The management of pressure sores depends on the stage and severity of the wound. For a stage III pressure sore, conservative management is typically the initial approach, with surgery reserved for more advanced cases or when conservative measures fail. Conservative management includes: 1. Pressure relief: Repositioning the patient every 2-3 hours 2. Wound care: Cleaning and dressing the wound 3. Nutritional support: Ensuring adequate protein and calorie intake 4. Hydrocolloid dressings: These maintain a moist environment, promote autolytic debridement, and protect the wound Surgical management is considered for: 1. Stage III and IV pressure sores that fail to heal with conservative measures 2. Exposed bone, tendon, or joint 3. Undermining, tunneling, or sinus tract formation Surgical options include: Immediate surgical debridement (Option A) is incorrect as it's too aggressive for initial management. Negative pressure wound therapy (Option C) is typically used after debridement and is not the first-line treatment. Flap reconstruction (Option D) is a surgical option reserved for more advanced cases or when conservative measures fail.
