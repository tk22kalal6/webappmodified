      "explanation": "pneumoperitoneum in laparoscopic surgery. Structure: It has a spring-loaded blunt stylet that retracts upon entering the peritoneal cavity. Use: It allows insufflation of CO I for laparoscopic procedures. Alternative Methods: Hasson’s technique is used for open laparoscopy instead. Veress Needle Feature Description Purpose Creates pneumoperitoneum for laparoscopy Mechanism Spring-loaded blunt stylet for safety Insertion Site Commonly at the umbilicus Alternative Hasson’s open technique Pneumoperitoneum in Laparoscopy Aspect Details Definition Artificial creation of gas insufflation in the peritoneal cavity to facilitate laparoscopic surgery. Common Gas Used Carbon dioxide (CO I ) due to its rapid absorption, non-combustibility, and high solubility in blood. Techniques Closed technique : Uses Veress needle for insufflation. Open technique : Uses Hasson’s cannula without prior insufflation. Insufflation Pressure 10-15 mmHg (optimal for maintaining surgical space",

      "explanation": "→ These are NOT included in the burn calculation. Burned Areas : Anterior Torso : 18% Posterior Torso : 18% Both Arms : 9% (each arm is 9%, but if only the front or back is affected, it would be 4.5% per arm) Perineum : 1% Total Burn Area Calculation : Anterior Torso (18%) + Posterior Torso (18%) + Both Arms (9%) + Perineum (1%) = 46% TBSA According to the Wallace rule of 9 , this is how the area burned is calculated: Adults Children Infants Head & neck 9% 18% 20% Front of chest & abdominal wall 9 x 2 = 18% 18% 10 x 2 = 20% Back of chest & abdominal wall 9 x 2 = 18% 18% 10 x 2 = 20% Lower limb 18 x 2 = 36% 13.5 x 2 = 27% 10 x 2 = 20% Upper limb 9 x 2 = 18% 18% 10 x 2 = 20% Perineum 1% 1%",

      "explanation": "using intravenous contrast. The contrast is injected intravenously, filtered by the kidneys, and visualizes the renal calyces, pelvis, ureters, and bladder in sequential X-ray images. The characteristic findings in IVP include contrast-filled renal collecting systems, ureters, and bladder , differentiating it from other contrast-based urinary tract studies. Urinary Tract Imaging Techniques Procedure Method Indications Key Features Intravenous Pyelogram (IVP) IV contrast injection Suspected urinary obstruction, nephrolithiasis, tumors Contrast seen in kidneys, ureters, and bladder on sequential films Retrograde Pyelogram (RGP) (Option A ruled out) Contrast injected via cystoscopy into ureters Suspected ureteral obstruction, non-visualization on IVP Contrast opacifies the ureter and renal pelvis without nephrogram Antegrade Pyelography (Option D ruled out) Contrast injected percutaneously into the renal pelvis Upper urinary tract obstruction, post-surgical assessment Contrast fills renal pelvis and ureters from above Combined RGP & Ureteroscopy (Option B ruled out) Ureteroscope inserted via",

      "question": "Which of the following is not related to disease progression?",
      "options": {
        "A": "Duration",
        "B": "Depth",
        "C": "Site",
        "D": "Stage of Cancer"
      },
      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "rarely metastasizes. Disease progression in BCC depends on: Depth of invasion (deeper tumors are more aggressive). Site (high-risk areas like the nose, periorbital region, and ears have a higher recurrence risk). Stage of cancer (advanced stages indicate deeper tissue involvement). Duration alone does not determine progression , as BCC can remain localized for years without significant spread. Factors Affecting BCC Progression Factor Effect on Progression Explanation Depth Yes Deeper invasion into muscle, cartilage, or bone increases severity Site Yes High-risk sites (face, scalp, ears) have more aggressive behavior Stage of Cancer Yes Later stages indicate increased tumor burden and invasion Duration No Slow growth means duration does not directly impact aggressiveness Depth (Option B): Incorrect because deeper BCC lesions have worse prognosis . Site (Option C): Incorrect because BCC at high-risk locations has higher recurrence and morbidity . Stage of Cancer (Option D): Incorrect because advanced-stage BCC is more difficult to treat .
