      },
      "correct_answer": "D",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: D) Transport immediately and delay interventions Explanation: The initial critical intervention is done, and the patient is transported. Initial life-saving critical interventions are not delayed and are immediately done at the site; only then is the patient transferred. Initial approach to an injured patient in the prehospital setting include 4 key priorities: Evaluates the scene Perform an initial assessment Make triage-transport decision Initial critical interventions and transport the patient Initial assessment (Options A&B): It is done rapidly and includes the identification of life-threatening situations that need immediate intervention. The a irway, b reathing, and c irculation are assessed. Once the spine is secured, the airway is secured, and assisted ventilation can be given as necessary. External bleeding is identified and immediately controlled, and resuscitation is initiated. Triage-transport decision (Option C): Rapid critical intervention is essential, but triaging and quick transport are equally important for optimal outcomes. The goal is to minimize the time from injury to definitive care, ideally keeping on-scene time under 15 minutes. The “load-and-go” approach enables critical interventions during transport, saving valuable time and improving hospital outcomes. Trauma patients with prehospital hypotension (<90 mm Hg), GCS ≤ 8, or non-extremity firearm injuries have higher mortality with prolonged prehospital time. Any previous comorbidities should be identified and communicated to the hospital for effective treatment and expedited care. Reference: Sabiston’s principles of surgery, 21st edition, pg: 389, 391.",

      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: B) Early deaths occur within hours of reaching the hospital Explanation: Early deaths occur within a few hours of reaching the hospital (Option B). The trimodal mortality model for trauma proposes that deaths following injury typically cluster around three distinct periods: immediate death, early death, and late death. The majority of deaths in traumatic injuries are due to brain injury (50%) (Option C) . Causes: Immediate death Early death Late death This peak occurs seconds to minutes after the injury. (Option A) Due to the extreme nature of these injuries, very few patients in this category can be saved, and prevention remains the most effective way to address this peak. This peak occurs within minutes to several hours post-injury. The \"golden hour\" of trauma care, characterized by a need for rapid assessment and resuscitation, is crucial in managing these patients. This peak emerges days to weeks after the initial injury. Severe and nonsurvivable injury Irreversible brain injury Hemorrhages of organs like: Heart Aorta Liver Lungs Pelvic fracture Intracranial hemorrhage/ brain lacerations/ contusions Hemorrhage of respiratory or abdominal organs. Multiple small injuries causing major blood loss. Infection/sepsis or Multiorgan failure (MODS) (80% cases) (Option D) Brain injury Hemorrhage With this model, a few conclusions can be made: The immediate and early deaths are fairly unchanged. Late deaths have decreased drastically. Causes of death remain unchanged. Reference: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3603725/ Advanced Trauma Life Support 10th edition - Pg xxxi",

      },
      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: A) Detailed history of the patient Explanation: The detailed history is part of the secondary assessment according to the ATLS protocol. ATLS protocol/ Advanced Trauma Life Support protocol: Primary survey: It includes the airway, breathing, circulation, disability or neurologic condition, and exposure and environmental control, which is known by the mnemonic ABCDE. The airway is assessed (Option B) immediately by a verbal response, and if it is not clear, needful intervention is carried out. Breathing is evaluated by chest movements, breath sounds and saturation and assisted ventilation is provided if needed. Circulation assessment includes ruling out shock (Option C) . IV access and immediate fluid resuscitation are recommended according to the ATLS in case of shock. Neurological assessment (Option D) is done to assess any traumatic brain or spinal injury and neurogenic shock. The GCS score is evaluated. Environmental control: The patient's clothes should be removed for a thorough examination, and hypothermia should be prevented (warm IV fluids, raised room temperature, body warmers). Secondary survey: This includes a complete patient history and a thorough head-to-toe assessment. It is done almost immediately in stable patients and includes radiological investigations. The AMPLE history mnemonic is used to gather key details ( A llergies, M edications, P ast medical history, L ast meal, E vents/ E nvironment related to the injury). Face deformities, posterior neck injuries, the torso, a per rectal examination for GI bleed, and prostate location are all included in this step. A thorough neurological examination and evaluation of superficial injuries are done. The complete physical examination and use of imaging are now included in the tertiary survey. ACLS protocol/ Advanced Cardiac Life Support System: This protocol provides algorithms for various cardiac emergencies and has to be followed accordingly. This has algorithms for: Cardiac arrest Acute coronary syndrome Bradycardia Tachycardia Immediate post-cardiac arrest care Suspected stroke The cardiac arrest algorithm is as follows: BLS/ Basic Life Support: This is conducted outside the hospital, where the patient is given basic life support. This can be at the site of occurrence of the event, which may be an accident, a cardiac arrest, drowning, etc. The steps include: Secure the scene and place yourselves and the patient in safety. Ensure someone calls for an ambulance. Assess the response The pulse and breathing are checked, and if they are normal, monitoring is continued with breathing support. If there is no pulse and/ or abnormal breathing, then immediate CPR is started. In situations where an AED is available, place the AED and follow its instructions. Otherwise, continue CPR and wait for help to arrive.",

The NEXUS criteria: The National Emergency X-Radiography Utilization Study (NEXUS) criteria are a clinical decision tool for cervical spine evaluation. The criteria are used to determine which patients with blunt trauma require radiographic evaluation of the cervical spine. If a patient meets all of the low-risk criteria, radiography is not required. The signs that show a trauma patient does not need spinal imaging are: Alert and stable No focal neurological deficits No altered level of consciousness Not intoxicated No midline spinal tenderness No distracting injury",

The first and foremost step in the primary assessment, as soon as the patient arrives in the hospital, according to the ATLS protocol, is to assess the airway while the cervical spine is stabilized and protected. The airway is assessed by eliciting a verbal response . The next step is to establish a clear airway. If one is absent, then go on to assess the circulation . The complete algorithm of primary assessment is as follows: According to the algorithm, Unstable airway = interventions to establish a stable airway like: Endotracheal intubation Airway adjuncts - Oropharyngeal and nasopharyngeal airway Gum elastic bougie Laryngeal airway Surgical airway Manual maneuvers - Chin Lift and jaw thrust.

      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: B) Circulation Explanation: The symptoms here point to the diagnosis of shock, which is a part of the assessment of circulation . Shock refers clinically to evidence of end-organ hypoperfusion present on physical examination. The major reason for shock in trauma patients is hypovolemia due to hemorrhage . Even though there are no major external injuries, hypovolemic shock can still be caused due to internal hemorrhages that may not be identified at first. The primary goal of cardiovascular assessment is to determine the presence or absence of shock. Clinical features of shock: Agitation or confusion Tachycardia Tachypnoea Diaphoresis Cool, mottled extremities Weak distal pulses Decreased pulse pressure Decreased urine output Hypotension As soon as shock is recognized, the following procedures are to be followed as per ATLS: IV access should be established with two large-bore peripheral catheters or an interosseous needle or central venous catheter. Initial resuscitation should involve 1L of warm crystalloid solution. Product-based resuscitation should be administered if fluid resuscitation fails. >1.5 L of crystalloids should be avoided as it increases the risk of death. Rapid screening should be conducted to identify the cause of life-threatening blood loss. Urine output is the best indicator of tissue perfusion, and central venous pressure is the best indicator of resuscitation needs. Patients are monitored for the progress of shock or its resolution. If it resolves, a comprehensive evaluation for all injuries is done. If not, then, Blood and blood product transfusions , Emergency laparotomy (abdominal bleed), Pelvic binder or sheet followed by surgery or angiographic treatment for embolization of artery (for pelvic fracture and increases pelvic volume), Thoracotomy (continued bleeding after chest tube placement) might be needed. The major locations that lead to extensive blood loss are: Chest Abdomen Retroperitoneum Pelvis / long bone fractures During this initial assessment, the cause of blood loss and any fracture is identified and immediately managed with Immediate direct pressure Fracture splinting Airway (Option A) issues are assessed by a simple verbal response and any difficulty is identified immediately and presents with different clinical signs. Neurological (Option B) deficits present with low GCS score and issues with mobility of extremities. Hypothermia (Option C) is evaluated and presents with a low core body temperature, and immediate measures to increase the same are done.

      "explanation": "Correct Answer: D) CT scan Explanation: A CT scan is not preferred in the primary survey for assessment of the cause of hemorrhage in trauma. The major locations that lead to extensive blood loss are: Chest Abdomen Retroperitoneum Pelvis / long bone fractures Hence, an effective investigative plan to focus on each source is made. The following investigations are done: X-ray examinations: Chest radiograph to rule out a hemothorax (Option B) Pelvic radiograph to rule out fractures (Option C) Ultrasound: Focused Abdominal Sonography in Trauma (FAST) (Option A) is a rapidly available ultrasound examination done to find intraperitoneal fluid. It can be used to assess the hepatorenal, splenorenal, and pelvis spaces for fluid that is considered to be blood in a trauma case. A CT scan (Option D) is done later, not immediately, as in the primary assessment. Diagnostic peritoneal lavage (DPL): This invasive procedure detects intraperitoneal hemorrhage, particularly in hemodynamically unstable patients. Computed tomography (CT): A CT scan can provide more detailed information about organ injury and hemorrhage. CTs of the head, chest, abdomen, and spine may be necessary to identify the source of bleeding. Angiography: This study helps evaluate and manage bleeding from pelvic fractures.",

        "D": "CRASH-2 showed TXA is ineffective in trauma."
      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: B) TXA reduced all-cause mortality versus placebo. Explanation: According to the CRASH-2 trial, tranexamic acid reduced all-cause mortality in hemorrhagic patients compared with a placebo. Tranexamic acid is a synthetic analogue of the amino acid lysine and an effective antifibrinolytic agent that competitively inhibits plasminogen activation to plasmin . It prevents the breakdown of fibrin that forms blood clots, thereby helping to form clots. The Clinical Randomization of an Antifibrinolytic in Significant Hemorrhage (CRASH-2) Trial: This is a multicenter randomized controlled civilian trial of 20,211 patients (Option D) . It showed that tranexamic acid (TXA) reduced all-cause mortality versus placebo (14.5% vs. 16%). The risk of death caused by bleeding was also reduced (4.9% vs. 5.7%). The study found that administering tranexamic acid within 3 hours of injury improved survival rates. A dose of 1 gram is usually given over 10 minutes in the field, followed by another 1 gram given over 8 hours. CRASH-2 suggested that TXA was less effective and could even be harmful if treatment was delayed more than 3 hours after admission (Option A) . The PED-TRAX study also suggests that TXA administration was associated with decreased mortality and improved neurologic and pulmonary outcomes (Option C) . The drug is inexpensive and easy to use with minimal side effects. The key is dosing, timing, and patient selection. CRASH-3 trial is currently being done to assess the effect of TXA on the risk of death or disability in patients with TBI. Reference: Sabiston’s Principles of Surgery, 21st edition, pg: 57.",

      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: B)6 Explanation: The Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) is a tool used to assess a patient’s level of consciousness based on three parameters: eye-opening , verbal response , and motor response . Each parameter is scored, and the total GCS score ranges from 3 (deep coma) to 15 (fully awake). Eye response : The patient's eyes do not open, even in response to pain, corresponding to a score of 1 . Verbal response : The patient makes incomprehensible sounds, corresponding to a score of 2 . Motor response : The patient exhibits abnormal flexion (decorticate posturing) in response to pain, corresponding to a score of 3 . Thus, the GCS score for this patient is: 1 (Eye) + 2 (Verbal) + 3 (Motor) = 6 Simplified Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) Table Category Response Score Eye Opening (E) Spontaneous 4 To speech 3 To pain 2 None 1 Verbal Response (V) Oriented 5 Confused conversation 4 Inappropriate words 3 Incomprehensible sounds 2 None 1 Motor Response (M) Obeys commands 6 Localizes to pain 5 Withdraws from pain 4 Abnormal flexion (decorticate) 3 Abnormal extension (decerebrate) 2 No response 1 Head Injury Severity: Clinical Classification Minor head injury GCS 15 with no LOC (loss of consciousness) Mild head injury GCS 14 or 15 with LOC Moderate head injury GCS 9 - 13 Severe head injury GCS 3 - 8 The GCS-P score is calculated by subtracting the Pupil Reactivity Score (PRS) from the Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) total score: GCS-P = GCS - PRS.

      "explanation": "Correct Answer: C) Nasogastric tube in a patient with mid-facial fractures Explanation: Insertion of a nasogastric tube is contraindicated in patients with mid-facial fractures due to the risk of intracranial placement. Instead, an orogastric tube should be used if necessary. Steps of Secondary Survey in Trauma Management Step Description Prerequisites Primary survey must be completed. Resuscitation initiated. All life-threatening conditions identified and addressed. Normalization of vital signs should have begun. Obtain AMPLE History (Option A) A focused history covering: A llergies, M edications, P revious medical history/illness or Pregnancy, L ast meal, E vents/environment related to the injury. This guides ongoing care and anticipates complications. Complete Physical Examination Systematic head-to-toe exam including front, back, sides, and hidden areas (scalp, axillae, perineum). Reassess airway and lung function. Vital Signs Assessment Monitor vital signs regularly. Narrow pulse pressure and tachycardia suggest hypovolemic shock. Be cautious with delayed hemodynamic changes in the elderly. Head and Face Examination (Option C) Check for scalp hematomas, skull depression, facial fractures, septal hematomas, raccoon eyes, or Battle’s sign. Avoid nasogastric tube insertion if facial trauma is present. Neck Examination Immobilize and palpate the neck. Rule out cervical spine injury with imaging or clinical criteria.. Chest Examination Palpate for tenderness, crepitus, and fractures. Inspect for seatbelt bruising and assess respiratory and heart sounds. Abdomen Examination Look for distension, bruising, tenderness, and marks. Assess for peritoneal injury. Pelvic and Rectal Examination (Option B) Check for pelvic instability and perineal injury. Perform digital rectal exam if there is suspicion of rectal or urethral injury, especially in spinal cord injury, pelvic fractures or gunshot wounds to the pelvis. Genital Examination Vaginal examination in women with pelvic fractures or lacerations. Assess for signs of vaginal trauma or pregnancy-related complications. Extremities Examination Evaluate for fractures, tenderness, deformities, neurovascular status, and signs of compartment syndrome. Neurological Examination Reassess Glasgow Coma Scale Evaluate sensory and motor functions, pupillary response, and signs of head injury. FAST (Option D) Use Focused Abdominal Sonography for Trauma (FAST) to check for internal bleeding in abdominal injury or unexplained blood loss. Special Considerations Update tetanus status. Assess urine output. Remove dressings to reassess injuries. Remove cervical collar briefly to evaluate the neck while maintaining immobilization. Diagnostic Tests and Consultations Obtain additional imaging or lab tests as needed and request specialist consultations.

      "explanation": "Correct Answer: C) Trauma and Injury Severity Score (TRISS) Explanation: TRISS (Trauma and Injury Severity Score) is designed to predict the probability of survival in trauma patients by combining the physiological aspects of trauma (Revised trauma score/RTS), anatomical aspects (Injury severity score/ISS), and patient age. It is widely used in trauma settings for patients with multiple injuries, as in this scenario. TRISS is calculated using a logistic regression formula and has been validated as one of the most accurate predictors of survival in trauma patients. The ISS (Injury Severity Score) quantifies the overall injury burden by summing up the square of the highest Abbreviated Injury Scale (AIS) scores in different body regions. It is useful in determining the severity of the injury but does not take into account physiological responses like the TRISS score does, making it less useful for predicting survival. (Option A) RTS (Revised Trauma Score) focuses on the physiological status of the patient, assessing respiratory rate, systolic blood pressure, and Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS). While it helps in triaging trauma patients, RTS alone is less comprehensive than TRISS, as it does not account for anatomical injury severity. (Option B) The MESS (Mangled Extremity Severity Score) is specific to assessing the severity of limb injuries and predicting the need for amputation. While useful for patients with severe extremity trauma, it is not appropriate for assessing the overall survival probability in patients with multiple systemic injuries.

      "question": "A 40-year-old male is admitted to the hospital after a major traumatic injury. On the third day post-trauma, his oxygen consumption and metabolic rate have increased significantly, and he exhibits elevated catecholamine levels. Which phase of the metabolic response is this patient most likely in?",

        "A": "Ebb phase",
        "B": "Flow phase",
        "C": "Anabolic phase",
        "D": "Recovery phase"
      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: B) Flow phase Explanation: The patient is in the Flow phase or catabolic phase , typically occurring 2–7 days post-trauma , characterized by increased metabolic rate, higher oxygen consumption, and tissue catabolism. Catecholamines, such as adrenaline, drive this hypermetabolic response as the body uses energy substrates for repair and organ function maintenance. Phases of Metabolic Response to Trauma Phase Timing Key Features Ebb Phase (Option A) First 24–48 hours ↓ Metabolic rate, ↓ Energy expenditure, ↓ Nitrogen excretion, Hemodynamic stability Flow Phase or Catabolic phase 2–7 days post-trauma ↑ Metabolic rate, ↑ Oxygen consumption, Catabolism, ↑ Catecholamines Anabolic Phase (Option C) Weeks post-trauma Positive nitrogen balance, Protein synthesis, Restoration of tissue mass The Recovery phase refers to the period when the metabolic response returns to normal, with stabilization of energy requirements and cessation of catabolism, which happens after the Anabolic phase has run its course.
