      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: A) Level I Explanation: The tip and lateral border of the anterior tongue primarily drain into the Level I lymph nodes , particularly: Level Ia (submental nodes) for the tip of the tongue Level Ib (submandibular nodes) for the lateral anterior tongue These are the first-echelon nodes for lesions located anteriorly and laterally, especially those close to the tip. Carcinoma Tongue: Common causes Smoking Spirit Sepsis Superficial glossitis Syphilis Spices Sharp tooth Leukoplakia, erythroplakia Symptoms Painless ulcer/swelling Excessive salivation Dysphagia Restricted tongue movement Halitosis Voice Change: In tumors of the posterior tongue Diagnosis Wedge biopsy; FNAC of lymph nodes Laryngoscopy: To view posterior growth CT/MRI: Assess tumor extent Orthopantomogram Treatment Surgery: For tumors <1 cm or carcinoma in situ: Wide local excision, 1 cm margin clearance. For tumors 1-2 cm: Partial glossectomy with 2 cm margin. For tumors >2 cm: Hemiglossectomy removing anterior 2/3 of tongue on one side. Posterior third growth: Total glossectomy (Kocher's approach). Palpable mobile lymph nodes: Radical neck dissection (unilateral/bilateral). Mandible involvement: Hemimandibulectomy. Commando Operation: Combined procedures involving wide excision or hemiglossectomy, hemimandibulectomy, and radical neck dissection. Radiotherapy: Small primary tumor: Curative radiotherapy (Brachytherapy). Large primary tumor: Pre-operative radiotherapy to reduce tumor size. Advanced tumors/secondaries: Palliative external radiotherapy. Post-operative: Radiotherapy to reduce relapse risk. Posterior third tumor: Curative and palliative radiotherapy. Chemotherapy: Used post-operatively or for palliation. Price-Hill Regimen: Methotrexate, vincristine, adriamycin, bleomycin and mercaptopurine. Level II (Option B) is incorrect because although it receives drainage from posterior parts of the anterior tongue and floor of mouth, it is typically a secondary drainage site for more posterior or deeper lesions. Level III (Option C) is incorrect because these nodes receive secondary or tertiary drainage from the tongue and are involved in more",

      "question": "A 65-year-old patient presents with metastatic adenocarcinoma, but the primary tumor site remains unidentified. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in the workup to help locate the primary tumor?",
      "options": {
        "A": "Complete blood count",

        "C": "Start chemotherapy",
        "D": "Exploratory surgery"
      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: B) PET scan Explanation: Carcinoma of unknown primary origin (CUP) r efers to metastatic cancer where the primary tumor is not identified at initial presentation. The most appropriate next step to locate the primary tumor is imaging studies, among which a PET scan is particularly useful. Diagnostic Workup: Clinicopathologic diagnosis: Evaluation of family and personal history: Identifies potential primary sites and risk factors. Physical examination: H/o previous surgeries and lesions. Biopsy and pathology: Fine-needle aspiration or core biopsy. Light microscopy with hematoxylin-and-eosin staining identifies the cancer type. Immunohistochemical tests: Immunohistochemical markers: These are peroxidase-labeled antibodies against specific tumor antigens, and help determine the tumor lineage. For e.g.: PSA and thyroglobulin (prostate and thyroid cancers). Cytokeratin stains: CK 7 and CK 20 determine tumor origin. Serum Tumor Markers and Cytogenetics: Tumor markers: PSA (for adenocarcinoma with bone metastasis), beta-human chorionic gonadotropin, alpha-fetoprotein (for germ cell tumors). Cytogenetics: Occasionally used to rule out lymphoma. Imaging Studies: CT scan: Abdominal and pelvic CT to locate the primary tumor and evaluate the disease extent. Mammography: Recommended for women with metastatic adenocarcinoma. MRI: Effective for assessing isolated axillary lymph node metastases and suspected occult primary breast carcinoma. PET Scan: Useful in non-cervical carcinoma of unknown primary origin (CUP) to guide biopsy and assess disease extent. (Option B) Advanced Techniques: Gene expression profiling: Uses DNA microarrays and RT-PCR to predict tumor origin based on gene expression patterns. Complete blood count (Option A ): Helpful for general health assessment; it does not directly assist in locating the primary tumor. Start chemotherapy (Option B): Should not be initiated without identifying the primary tumor, as treatment decisions are based on the tumor’s origin and characteristics. Exploratory surgery (Option C): Not typically the first step; imaging studies are preferred to guide further diagnostic approaches.",

Types of Incisions in Neck Dissection 1. Macfee Incision: Two horizontal parallel incisions. Provide the best scar cosmesis. Limited access to deeper structures. 2.Modified Macfee Incision: Improves access to all neck node levels and a narrow bridge, thus facilitating an easier dissection of the spinal accessory nerve. 3.Reversed Hockey Stick Incision: Long anterior skin flap, superior access to all five lymph node levels. Other incisions: Conley/Schecter incision Hayes Martin incision Triradiate incision Apron incision Fischel T-J incision Macfee incision (Option A) is cosmetically favorable but has limited access to deeper structures, which can compromise disease clearance in extensive cases. Y-shaped incision (Option C) is historically significant and provides broad access. However, it is less commonly used today due to less favorable cosmetic outcomes Modified Macfee Incision (Option D): While it offers better access than the original Macfee Incision, it may still be less optimal compared to the Modified Schobinger Incision for comprehensive exposure.",

      },
      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: C) Segmental mandibulectomy Explanation: If there is more than superficial cortical erosion of the mandible, the marrow space is at risk of harboring malignancy and thus, segmental mandibulectomy is required for adequate margin control. Lower Alveolar Cancer: Mostly seen in men. Squamous cell carcinoma(SCC) is the most common malignancy of the lower alveolus. Tumor Spread: Can extend to the cheek, floor of the mouth, retromolar trigone, or hard palate. May invade underlying bone and spread rapidly along the neurovascular bundle. Nodal metastases commonly occur in submandibular and upper jugular nodes. Surgery: Preferred treatment method. Early Lesions (tumors adherent to periosteum): Treated by local excision with marginal resection of the mandible. Extensive Lesions (bone invasion present): Require wide excision, potentially involving segmental or hemimandibulectomy. Nodal Involvement: Block dissection may be performed if nodes are palpable. Radiotherapy (Option A) is avoided due to the risk of radio-osteonecrosis and limited effectiveness for extensive bone involvement. Local excision with marginal resection (Option B) is inadequate for advanced tumors with extensive bone erosion and invasion beyond the inferior alveolar canal. Marginal resection along with block dissection (Option D) does not fully address extensive bone invasion.",

      "options": {
        "A": "Wide local excision with frozen section control",
        "B": "Partial maxillectomy with ipsilateral neck dissection",
        "C": "Partial maxillectomy without neck dissection",
        "D": "Radiotherapy alone"
      },
      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: C) Partial maxillectomy without neck dissection Explanation: For an adenoid cystic carcinoma of the hard palate, partial maxillectomy is the appropriate surgical approach to ensure adequate margins. Despite the absence of clinical bone invasion, microscopic invasion is common in these tumors. Elective neck dissection is generally not performed for adenoid cystic carcinomas of the hard palate due to their low propensity for lymphatic spread. Carcinoma of the Hard Palate Salivary gland tumors in the palate are often malignant, with adenoid cystic carcinoma being common. Adenoid cystic carcinoma : Present as a single, solid, smooth swelling with an ulcer on the summit. Squamous cell carcinoma : Characterized by an ulcer with raised and everted edges. Upper deep cervical lymph nodes are involved in 25% of cases. Malignant tumors can invade the periosteum, bone, maxilla, sinus, or nose. Risk factor Reverse smokers have higher risk of squamous cell carcinoma due to repeated thermal injury from smoking rolled tobacco (Churat). Investigations Wedge biopsy FNAC lymph node CT Scan: To check for tumor extensions. Treatment Wide excision with removal of the underlying palatal bone. Maxillectomy: Partial or total, often done using the Weber-Ferguson incision . Reconstruction: With a myocutaneous flap and dental prosthesis. Postoperative radiotherapy and neck block dissection are often required. Wide local excision with frozen section control (Option A): While wide local excision might be considered for very small, superficial lesions, a 2.5 cm adenoid cystic carcinoma of the hard palate typically requires more extensive resection to ensure clear margins and address potential bone involvement. Partial maxillectomy with ipsilateral neck dissection (Option B): Although partial maxillectomy is correct, routine elective neck dissection is not typically performed for adenoid cystic carcinomas of the hard palate unless there is clinical or radiological evidence of nodal involvement. Radiotherapy alone (Option D) is not the standard first-line treatment for resectable adenoid cystic carcinomas of the hard palate. Surgery is generally preferred, with radiotherapy often used as adjuvant treatment.

        "D": "Spontaneous remission of fibrosis"
      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: B) Malignant transformation Explanation: The patient's presentation is consistent with oral submucous fibrosis (OSMF). The most significant long-term complication of untreated OSMF is malignant transformation. Oral submucous fibrosis is considered a potentially malignant disorder due to its significant risk of progressing to oral squamous cell carcinoma. Regular follow-up and screening of OSMF patients are crucial for the early detection of any malignant changes. Management should focus on habit cessation, nutritional support, and addressing fibrosis to potentially reduce the risk of malignant transformation.

Hemimandibulectomy: Performed when the tumor involves the mandible. Neck lymph node dissection: Radical or modified radical dissection depending on lymph node involvement. Radiotherapy: Curative or palliative: Brachytherapy or external radiotherapy. Pre-op radiotherapy: Given to shrink fixed lymph nodes, making them operable. Post-op radiotherapy: For T3/T4 tumors or N2/N3 nodal status to reduce recurrence. Chemotherapy: Pre-operative to downstage tumors. Post-operative to improve outcomes. Chemoradiotherapy for unresectable tumors. Drugs Used: Methotrexate, cisplatin, vincristine, bleomycin, adriamycin. Candidiasis (Option A): While oral candidiasis can occur in OSMF patients due to an altered oral environment, it is not considered a major complication of untreated OSMF. Bilateral submandibular gland hypertrophy (Option C) is not a typical complication of OSMF. In fact, OSMF may lead to atrophy of salivary glands rather than hypertrophy. Spontaneous remission of fibrosis (Option D): OSMF is a progressive condition and does not undergo spontaneous remission. Without intervention, the fibrosis typically worsens over time.",

      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "recommended. Correct Answer: B) Drains to ipsilateral submandibular nodes; levels I-III neck dissection is recommended. Explanation: The lymphatic drainage of the lower lip is primarily to the submental (level IA) and submandibular (level IB) nodes . There's a significant risk of occult nodal metastasis for a lesion of this size, especially one close to the commissure. Therefore, a selective neck dissection, including levels I-III on the ipsilateral side, is typically recommended even in N0. Drains to submental nodes; level I neck dissection is sufficient (Option A): While the submental nodes are involved in lower lip drainage, they are not the sole primary site. Moreover, dissection of level I alone would be inadequate for a lesion of this size High risk of contralateral metastasis; bilateral neck dissection is needed (Option C): Lower lip lesions can occasionally metastasize to contralateral nodes, especially when close to the midline. A lesion on the right side extending to the commissure doesn't typically warrant bilateral neck dissection unless there's clinical or radiological evidence of contralateral spread. Drains to preauricular and parotid nodes; requires superficial parotidectomy (Option D): This pattern of drainage is more typical for upper lip or cheek lesions. Carcinoma Lip Common Causes UV radiation exposure Tobacco use Chronic irritation (e.g., ill-fitting dentures) Immunosuppression Human papillomavirus (HPV) infection Chronic inflammatory conditions (e.g., actinic cheilitis) Clinical Features Non-healing progressive painless ulcer Everted edge with indurations Growth moves with the lip Submental, submandibular and upper deep neck nodes may get enlarged. Tender firm lymph nodes may be due to infection; hard initially non-tender nodes are due to carcinoma spread. Fungation, bleeding, halitosis. Diagnosis Wedge biopsy FNAC of lymph nodes CT/MRI head and neck Management Early Stage (T1-T2N0): Wide local excision with 1 cm margins Consider elective neck dissection for tumors >2 cm or >4 mm depth Reconstruction: Primary closure, local flaps, or skin grafts Advanced Stage (T3-T4 or N+): Wide local excision with ≥ 1 cm margins Neck dissection (comprehensive or selective based on nodal status) Complex reconstruction (local/regional flaps, free tissue transfer) Adjuvant radiotherapy or chemoradiotherapy based on pathological findings Management of the Neck: Elective neck dissection for high-risk tumors (>2 cm, >4 mm depth) Therapeutic neck dissection for clinically positive nodes Levels typically addressed: I-III for N0 neck, I-V for N+ neck",

Ipsilateral selective neck dissection (levels I-III) is appropriate for unilateral lesions not crossing the midline. Wide local excision with 1 cm margins and bilateral neck dissection (Option C): Bilateral neck dissection is not routinely indicated for unilateral lip lesions unless they cross the midline or approach the oral commissure. Radiotherapy alone (Option D) is not the standard first-line treatment for resectable lip carcinomas of this size. Surgery offers better local control and allows for pathological staging of the neck.

      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: B) Blocks PD-1 receptor, enhancing T-cell anti-tumor activity Explanation: Pembrolizumab is a monoclonal antibody that targets the programmed cell death-1 (PD-1) receptor. By blocking PD-1, it prevents the interaction between PD-1 and its ligands (PD-L1 and PD-L2). This blockade enhances T-cell function and anti-tumor immune responses. In oral cavity cancers, this leads to improved tumor cell recognition and destruction by the immune system. Inhibiting VEGF to prevent tumor angiogenesis (Option A) is the mechanism of action for drugs like bevacizumab. Targeting EGFR to inhibit tumor cell proliferation (Option C) describes the mechanism of action for cetuximab. Activating NK cells to induce antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (Option D) is more closely associated with drugs like cetuximab, which can induce ADCC.

      },
      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: C) Concurrent chemoradiotherapy Explanation: Concurrent chemoradiotherapy is the most appropriate adjuvant treatment for this patient due to the presence of high-risk features: close surgical margins and extracapsular extension (ECE) in lymph nodes. In this case, the close margin and ECE in multiple nodes warrant the addition of chemotherapy to radiotherapy to improve locoregional control and overall survival. Radiotherapy alone (Option A) is insufficient for high-risk features like ECE. Chemotherapy alone (Option B) is not a standard practice as adjuvant therapy in oral cavity cancer. Observation and close follow-up (Option D) is inappropriate, given the high-risk features present. Adjuvant Therapy in Oral Cavity Cancer: Adjuvant therapy refers to additional treatment given after primary treatment (usually surgery) to reduce the risk of cancer recurrence. In oral cavity cancer, it typically involves radiation therapy, chemotherapy, or a combination of both. Indications for Adjuvant Therapy: Therapy Indications Radiotherapy alone Intermediate risk features: T3 or T4a primary tumors N2 or N3 nodal disease (without extracapsular extension) Perineural invasion Lymphovascular invasion Single node >3 cm or multiple positive nodes Close margins (between 5mm and 1cm) Concurrent chemoradiotherapy High-risk features: Positive surgical margins Extracapsular extension of nodal disease T4b tumors N3 nodal disease Multiple positive nodes with extracapsular extension Specific indications pT3 or pT4 primary tumors N2 or N3 neck disease Perineural invasion Vascular embolism Lymphatic invasion Considerations for chemotherapy addition Age <70 years Good performance status No significant comorbidities Adjuvant therapy is decided based on pathological findings after surgery. It aims to improve locoregional control and overall survival. The most common chemotherapy agent used is cisplatin. Radiotherapy is typically started within 6 weeks of surgery.

      },
      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: A) Radial forearm free flap Explanation: The radial forearm free flap (RFFF) is the most appropriate choice for reconstructing this oral cavity defect involving a significant portion of the mobile tongue. In this case, where more than 50% of the mobile tongue is involved, the RFFF would provide the best functional outcome in terms of speech and swallowing. The RFFF is considered the gold standard for tongue reconstruction due to its: Thin and pliable nature, allowing for better mobility and articulation Long vascular pedicle, facilitating easier anastomosis Large surface area that can be harvested Minimal bulk, which is crucial for preserving tongue function Ability to provide sensate reconstruction if needed Flaps Used for Reconstruction in Oral Cavity Cancer: The goal of reconstruction is to restore form and function, including speech, swallowing, and aesthetics. The choice of flap should balance the needs of the defect with donor site morbidity and the patient's overall condition. 1. Radial Forearm Free Flap (RFFF): Ideal for tongue, floor of mouth, buccal mucosa Thin, pliable, with long pedicle Potential for sensate reconstruction 2. Anterolateral Thigh (ALT) Free Flap (Option B): Versatile for larger defects of the mandible, floor of mouth, or pharynx, especially in patients who are poor candidates for free flap surgery. Can be thinned for intraoral use. Minimal donor site morbidity 3. Fibula Free Flap: Gold standard for mandibular reconstruction. Can provide bone, muscle, and skin. 4. Pectoralis Major Myocutaneous Flap (Option C): Workhorse pedicled flap for head and neck. Useful for salvage cases or when free flaps are contraindicated. Harvesting a pectoralis major myocutaneous flap based on the thoracoacromial artery (blue arrow), skin paddle (outlined in blue), and muscle flap (outlined in green). B, The flap was rotated 180 degrees and used to cover the neck wound. 5. Submental Island Flap: Regional flap for small to medium intraoral defects. Good color match for facial skin. 6. Temporalis Muscle Flap: For palate and maxillary defects. Proximity to defect site. Supraclavicular artery island flap (Option D) is a regional flap that, while useful for some head and neck reconstructions, lacks the pliability and thinness required for optimal tongue reconstruction. It's more suitable for cutaneous defects of the face and neck.",

The correct treatment for this T2N1M0 with Stage III squamous cell carcinoma of the tongue is surgery followed by adjuvant radiotherapy. For T2N1M0 oral cavity cancers, the standard of care is surgical resection of the primary tumor with appropriate margins, along with neck dissection for the clinically positive lymph nodes.

      },
      "correct_answer": "D",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: D) All of the above Explanation: Field cancerization, field defect, or field effect refers to the condition in which a particular site is completely exposed to carcinogens often and hence has a tendency to develop a malignancy entirely or at multiple sites instead of at just one focal point. This explains the recurrence of tumors and the development of second primary tumors after the removal of the first, particularly in the oral cavity. Field cancerization is a process of transforming a precancerous lesion into a cancerous one. Prolonged exposure to carcinogens like tobacco and alcohol in the oral cavity leads to widespread epithelial changes, resulting in multifocal carcinoma. Criteria for a second primary to be due to field cancerization: The neoplasm must be distinct and anatomically separate (dysplastic mucosa around a tumor depicts a multicentric primary neoplasm and not a new primary tumor). A potential second primary due to metastasis or local relapse must be excluded ( tumor after 3 years of first diagnosis or new tumor at least 2cm of normal epithelium away from the first one).
