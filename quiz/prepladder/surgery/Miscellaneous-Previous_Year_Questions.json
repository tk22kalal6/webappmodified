        "C": "Thoracic cavity",
        "D": "Dural and subdural spaces"
      },
      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: C) Thoracic cavity Explanation : The e-FAST is a rapid, non-invasive ultrasound examination used primarily in trauma settings to detect free fluid (such as blood) in the abdomen or Thorax. If clear lung fields on the chest radiography rule out pneumothorax or hemothorax, eFAST can help detect other sources of bleeding, such as intraperitoneal haemorrhage, to guide further management. It can be used to assess the hepatorenal, splenorenal, and pelvis spaces for fluid that is considered to be blood in a trauma case. Pelvic Cavity (Option A) can be assessed in e-FAST, but the question is about extrabdominal cavities assessed in e-FAST. Peripheral vessels (Option B) are not normally evaluated with e-FAST. Dural and subdural spaces (Option D) are assessed by neuroimaging but not by e-FAST. Reference: Bailey and Love’s Short Practice of Surgery, 28th Edition, Page 373",

      },
      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: A) No Verbal response Explanation: A verbal score of 1 on the Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) means no verbal response from the patient, indicating the most severe level of impairment in verbal communication. The Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) is a tool used to assess a patient’s level of consciousness based on three parameters: eye-opening , verbal response , and motor response . Each parameter is scored, and the total GCS score ranges from 3 (deep coma) to 15 (fully awake). Simplified Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) Category Response Score Eye Opening (E) Spontaneous 4 To speech 3 To pain 2 None 1 Verbal Response (V) Oriented 5 (Option D ruled out) Confused conversation 4 Inappropriate words 3 (Option B ruled out) Incomprehensible sounds 2 (Option C ruled out) None 1 Motor Response (M) Obeys commands 6 Localizes to pain 5 Withdraws from pain 4 Abnormal flexion (decorticate) 3 Abnormal extension (decerebrate) 2 No response 1 Reference: Bailey & Love's Short Practice of Surgery, 28th Edition, Pages 357, 361",

      "question": "Most common site of peripheral aneurysm?",
      "options": {
        "A": "Brachial artery",
        "B": "Popliteal artery",
        "C": "Radial artery",
        "D": "Femoral artery"
      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: B) Popliteal artery Explanation: The popliteal artery is the most common site for a peripheral aneurysm . Aneurysms in this location are more frequent due to the anatomical structure of the popliteal artery and its exposure to mechanical stress in the knee area. Popliteal artery aneurysms are often associated with degenerative changes in the arterial wall, such as atherosclerosis. These aneurysms can lead to the development of a pulsatile mass behind the knee and may increase the risk of complications such as thrombosis or embolism. Brachial artery (Option A) is located in the upper arm and is responsible for supplying blood to the arm. However, aneurysms in the brachial artery are not as common compared to other popliteal artery aneurysms. Radial artery (Option C) is located in the forearm and is a major artery responsible for supplying blood to the hand. While aneurysms can occur in the radial artery, they are rare compared to other sites. Femoral artery (Option D) aneurysms are uncommon compared to those in the popliteal artery but can still occur.

      "question": "Which one of the following is absent in cases of massive blood transfusion?",
      "options": {
        "A": "DIC",
        "B": "Febrile transfusion reaction",
        "C": "Hypercalcemia",
        "D": "Thrombocytopenia"
      },
      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: C) Hypercalcemia Explanation: Hypercalcemia is not commonly seen in massive blood transfusions. In fact, the risk is usually the opposite (hypocalcemia) due to citrate-binding calcium. Massive blood transfusion refers to the transfusion of a large volume of blood products over a relatively short period. While blood transfusions can be life-saving, they can also be associated with certain adverse effects. Complications of massive blood transfusion Complication Cause Effect Hypothermia Transfusion of cold blood (stored at 4°C). Body temperature drops, leading to impaired clotting mechanisms (coagulopathy), and worsening bleeding. Coagulopathy Dilution of clotting factors and platelets due to transfusion; consumption of clotting factors by ongoing haemorrhage. Impaired blood clotting, prolonged bleeding time, thrombocytopenia, and increased risk of continued bleeding. (Option D ruled out) DIC (Option A ruled out) Due to the release of procoagulant substances Leads to haemorrhage due to depleted hemostatic components, tissue hypoxia, and infarction due to microthrombi, or both. Citrate Toxicity Large volumes of transfused blood contain citrate, which binds to calcium. Hypocalcemia leads to muscle cramps, seizures, and cardiac arrhythmias. Hypocalcemia Packed red blood cells (PRBCs) and other blood products are preserved with citrate , an anticoagulant. Citrate binds to ionised calcium (Ca² I ) in the recipient's blood, reducing the free calcium level - hypocalcemia Presents as muscle spasms, cardiac arrhythmias, and decreased myocardial contractility Hyperkalemia Potassium leaks from stored red blood cells into plasma during storage. Elevated potassium levels (hyperkalemia) can cause cardiac arrhythmias, potentially leading to cardiac arrest. Hypokalemia Potassium may shift intracellularly once transfused red blood cells are metabolically revived. Hypokalemia causes muscle weakness, paralysis, and cardiac arrhythmias. Metabolic Alkalosis Rapid metabolism of citrate into bicarbonate. Increased pH (alkalosis) can lead to muscle twitching, irritability, and impaired oxygen release from haemoglobin. Metabolic Acidosis Inadequate tissue perfusion leads to lactic acid accumulation. Lowered blood pH (acidosis) leads to confusion, fatigue, rapid breathing, and worsened cardiovascular function. Transfusion Related Acute Lung Injury (TRALI) Antibodies in transfused blood activate the recipient's immune response, causing inflammation and fluid buildup in the lungs. Non-cardiogenic pulmonary oedema, presenting as acute respiratory distress with hypoxia within 6 hours of transfusion. Transfusion Associated Circulatory Overload (TACO) Volume of transfused blood exceeds the patient’s capacity to manage, leading to fluid overload. Pulmonary oedema, shortness of breath, hypertension, and signs of heart failure. Iron Overload Repeated transfusions lead to excessive accumulation of iron. Iron deposits in organs (e.g., liver, heart, pancreas), lead to organ damage and failure over time. Hemolytic Reactions ABO or Rh incompatibility. Rapid destruction of red blood cells (hemolysis), causes fever, chills, hemoglobinuria, and potentially acute renal failure or shock. Allergic Reactions Reaction to proteins in transfused blood products. Symptoms range from mild itching, rash, or hives to severe anaphylaxis (airway constriction, low blood pressure, shock). Bacterial Contamination Blood products are contaminated during collection or storage. Sepsis, characterized by fever, chills, low blood pressure, and possibly septic shock. Febrile transfusion reaction (Option B ruled out) It is a non-hemolytic condition that is not completely understood but is believed to be caused by residual white blood",

        "A": "Mucus extravasation cyst",
        "B": "Arises from submandibular salivary gland",

      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: B) Arises from submandibular salivary gland Explanation: A ranula is a mucus extravasation cyst, which most commonly arises from the sublingual salivary gland, not the submandibular salivary gland. Ranula Definition (Options A & C ruled out) Ranulas are a type of extravasation mucocele , caused by the rupture of the main duct or obstructed acini of the sublingual gland . They appear as bluish, translucent, cystic swelling on the floor of the mouth and resemble the belly of a frog. Location Commonly found in the anterior floor of the mouth. When it extends through the mylohyoid muscle, it presents as a submental swelling known as a \"plunging ranula.\" Symptoms Typically soft, fluctuant, and painless unless infected. Diagnosis Confirmed through Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) Ultrasound Aspiration of thick, sticky saliva differentiates it from a lymphangioma. Treatment (Option D ruled out) Excision of the sublingual gland is preferred. Incision, drainage, and marsupialisation have low success rates. Although marsupialisation is often adequate, it has a higher recurrence rate compared to sublingual gland excision. OK-432 injection Botulinum toxin injections",

      "question": "What is the probable diagnosis for a patient who is taking steroids for psoriasis and is experiencing a low-grade fever only at night, weight loss, and an ulcer on her neck with undermined edges, as depicted in the provided image?",
      "options": {
        "A": "Psoriasis flare-up",
        "B": "Tubercular lymphadenitis",
        "C": "Lymphosarcoma",
        "D": "Syphilis"
      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: B) Tubercular lymphadenitis Explanation: The patient’s symptoms of night sweats, weight loss, and the ulcer with undermined edges indicate Tubercular lymphadenitis. It is a common manifestation of tuberculosis, especially in immunosuppressed patients, such as those taking steroids. Steroids can weaken the immune system, increasing susceptibility to infections like tuberculosis. Lymph Node TB (Tuberculous Lymphadenitis) Most common extrapulmonary TB presentation. Risk Groups HIV-positive individuals, Immunosuppressive individuals, children, and non-Caucasian women. Causative Organism Previously M. bovis; now mainly M. tuberculosis. Clinical Presentation Painless swelling in lymph nodes, usually posterior cervical or supraclavicular (historically called scrofula). Early disease: Discrete nodes Advanced disease: Matted, nontender mass, possible fistula draining caseous material. Pulmonary disease in <50% of cases. Systemic symptoms are uncommon except in HIV-positive patients. Non-specific reaction → Matting → Cold Abscess → Collar stud abscess → Sinus formation Diagnosis Fine-needle aspiration biopsy (80% yield) or surgical excision biopsy. Granulomatous lesions may or may not contain AFBs. Cultures are positive in 70–80% of cases. HIV-positive patients: Poorly organised or absent granulomas; higher bacterial loads increase diagnostic yield. Differential Diagnosis Infectious diseases Lymphomas Metastatic carcinomas Rare disorders: Kikuchi’s disease, Kimura’s disease, Castleman’s disease. Psoriasis flare-up (Option A) presents red, scaly patches on the skin and is unlikely to cause the ulcer and systemic symptoms described. Lymphosarcoma (Option C) can present with",

      "question": "A 45-year-old woman comes to the OPD with a history of a lump in the left breast. On clinical examination, the size of the lump in the left breast is 9x10 cm with the following appearance and no axillary lymphadenopathy. The histopathology of the biopsy from the lump shows increased stromal cellularity and typical leaflike architecture. What is your likely diagnosis?",

        "A": "Phyllodes tumour",
        "B": "Giant fibroadenoma",
        "C": "Inflammatory carcinoma",
        "D": "Ductal carcinoma"
      },
      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: A) Phyllodes tumour Explanation: The clinical features and HPE show increased stromal cellularity and overgrowth, giving rise to the typical leaf-like architecture, suggesting phyllodes tumour. Phyllodes tumours, also called cystosarcoma phyllodes, are stromal tumours developing from the breast's connective tissue. It occurs in middle-aged women (40 - 50 years). Most phyllodes tumours are benign (noncancerous) , but a small number (about 10% to 15%) can be borderline or malignant (cancerous). They present as a lump in the breast, which may be firm, smooth, and well-defined. It may also grow quickly from a few centimetres to massive lesions involving the entire breast. Phyllodes tumour is differentiated from fibroadenoma based on its overgrowth of stroma, increased mitotic activity and cellularity, and nuclear pleomorphism. (Option B ruled out) Inflammatory carcinoma (Option C) presents with redness, swelling, warmth, and often skin changes (such as peau d’orange). It also presents with more aggressive symptoms like axillary lymphadenopathy and is often accompanied by pain. Ductal carcinoma (Option D) usually presents with irregular masses , skin changes , and often axillary lymphadenopathy . Histologically, it is characterised by the proliferation of malignant epithelial cells in the ducts, not the stromal cellularity and leaflike pattern seen in phyllodes tumours.

        "B": "Pelvic bone fracture",
        "C": "Rectal foreign body",
        "D": "Bladder stone"
      },
      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: C) Rectal foreign body Explanation: The correct diagnosis based on the abdominal x-ray given is a rectal foreign body. It refers to an object that has been accidentally or intentionally inserted into the rectum and is typically visible on abdominal X-rays . These are serious injuries and generally require surgical intervention. Temporary colostomy may be necessary for recovery. There’s a risk of developing necrotising fasciitis , so broad-spectrum antibiotics are crucial. Bladder or urethral damage can also be associated with these injuries. Ureterocoele (Option A) is a congenital dilation of the distal ureter that occurs at the ureterovesical junction . It is usually identified on IVU with a \"cobra head\" appearance, which is a hallmark of a ureterocele, but it would not be visible as a foreign object in the rectal area on an abdominal x-ray. Pelvic bone fracture (Option B) would be visible on an x-ray, but it would involve fractures of the pelvic bones but not a foreign body in the rectum. Bladder stone (Option D) would be visible on an abdominal x-ray as a radio-opaque mass in the bladder, but the given image is suggestive of a rectal foreign body.",
