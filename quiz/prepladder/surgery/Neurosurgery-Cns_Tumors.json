Spinal Tumors: 20% of the central nervous system (CNS) tumours are spinal tumours & mostly Benign It affects stability and compresses neural structures, leading to pain(typically worse at night), deformities, and functional impairments. Tumor Category Type Description Extradural Tumors (55%) Metastatic Tumors The most common spine tumours, with the most common metastases, are Breast (21%), Lung (14%), Prostate (7.5%), and RCC. Osteolytic Mets Lung cancer, RCC, Multiple myeloma. Osteoblastic Mets Prostate cancer. (Option A) Primary Tumors (2%) Benign Osteoid osteoma, osteoblastoma, chondroma, chondroblastoma, giant cell tumours, hemangioma, and lymphangioma typically occur in posterior elements. Intermediate Aggressive osteoblastoma, chordoma. Malignant Osteosarcoma, chondrosarcoma, Ewing’s sarcoma, neuroectodermal tumours, lymphoma, fibrosarcoma, and liposarcoma It usually involves the vertebral body. (Option C) Intradural Tumors (40%) Extramedullary They arise from the meninges or nerve roots. Examples include meningiomas (dural-based, often in the thoracic spine) and schwannomas (benign, from the nerve sheath). Neurofibromas are fusiform and can grow within nerve roots. Intramedullary Arise within spinal cord parenchyma; include ependymomas (most common in adults) (Option B) and astrocytomas (common in children).

      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: C) Shows no response to steroids. Explanation: Primary CNS lymphoma typically shows a dramatic but short-lived response to steroids . (Option A) Steroids have a cytolytic effect on the tumour cells and should be withheld before biopsy to ensure accurate diagnosis. (Option B) Cytolytic effect of steroids causes partial/complete resolution on CT. Hence, it is also called a Ghost cell tumour . Primary CNS lymphoma is a rare but increasingly common tumour of the central nervous system, particularly in immunocompromised individuals such as those with AIDS or transplant recipients. Imaging typically shows hyperdense, enhancing lesions. Immunocompetent patients : Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) Immunocompromised patients : More aggressive large cell variant. Diagnosis: Confirmed via stereotactic biopsy. (Option D) Treatment : Chemotherapy (especially high-dose methotrexate ) and Radiation therapy (EBRT) AIDS patient - Include highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART). Prognosis : Survival is very short (Usually < 1 Year) Reference: Sabiston’s Textbook of Surgery, 21st Edition, Page 1896.",

      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: C) Meningioma Explanation: Meningiomas are the most common primary brain tumours in adults. They are typically benign and arise from the meninges, the layers of tissue covering the brain and spinal cord. They account for about 36-37% of all primary brain tumours in adults, making them the most frequent type. Depending on their location, meningiomas can cause symptoms such as headaches, seizures, and neurological deficits, including cognitive and personality changes when located in the frontal lobe. The slow-growing nature of these tumours often leads to gradual symptom progression. Medulloblastomas (Option A) are highly malignant tumours originating from the cerebellum and are most commonly seen in children. They typically cause cerebellar dysfunction, such as ataxia, and increased intracranial pressure, leading to headaches and vomiting. These tumours are rare in adults, especially in the frontal lobe. Glioblastomas (GBMs) (Option B) are aggressive, malignant tumours arising from astrocytes and are the most common malignant primary brain tumour in adults. They present rapidly with symptoms like headaches, seizures, cognitive decline, and focal neurological deficits. However, they are less common than meningiomas. Oligodendrogliomas (Option D) originate from oligodendrocytes , which produce the myelin sheath in the central nervous system. These tumours often present with seizures and may occur in the frontal lobe. They are less common than meningiomas, slower-growing than glioblastomas, and have a better prognosis.

Clinical Features Seizures Headaches Focal neurological deficits Histopathological (HPE) Findings \"Fried-egg\" appearance of tumour cells Chicken-wire capillary pattern Radiological Findings MRI is preferred for diagnosis.

The dural tail sign is the most characteristic imaging feature associated with meningiomas . Meningioma: Aspect Description Definition Benign tumours arise from the meninges surrounding the brain and spinal cord. Clinical Features Headaches Visual disturbances Neurological deficits due to mass effect Vasogenic oedema (brain swelling) Potential for obstructive hydrocephalus (if CSF flow is blocked) Radiological Features Contrast-enhancing mass Dural base attachment Possible calcifications Dural tail sign (specific to meningiomas) Management Surgery (preferred if the tumour is large or symptomatic) Radiotherapy or stereotactic radiosurgery if surgery is risky. Watch-and-wait approach for small, incidental tumours in older patients. Calcified mass (Option A): Calcifications are usually seen in meningiomas but are not as specific as the dural tail sign. Ring enhancement (Option B) pattern is more commonly associated with abscesses or glioblastomas and is not characteristic of meningiomas. Vasogenic oedema (Option D): Meningiomas can cause vasogenic oedema due to the mass effect on surrounding brain tissue.

      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: A) Frontal lobe tumors Explanation: Frontal lobe tumours are most likely to cause personality changes, impaired judgment, and difficulty with motor planning. Functions of the frontal lobe: Executive Functions: The frontal lobe is essential for reasoning, planning, and decision-making, and tumours can impair these abilities, affecting judgment. Personality and Social Behavior: Tumours can lead to significant personality changes and inappropriate behaviour . Motor Planning and Control: The primary motor cortex in the frontal lobe controls voluntary movements, and tumours can disrupt motor planning and execution, leading to difficulties with complex movements. Temporal lobe tumours (Option B) typically cause memory problems (particularly difficulty forming new memories), auditory hallucinations, language comprehension difficulties, and seizures. Occipital lobe tumours (Option C) mainly affect vision and visual processing, causing symptoms such as visual hallucinations, difficulty recognising objects or faces, and partial or complete loss of vision. Cerebellar tumours (Option D) typically cause problems with balance and coordination, difficulty with fine motor skills, nystagmus (involuntary eye movements), and slurred speech.",

      "question": "A 62-year-old man with a 40-pack-year smoking history presents with worsening headaches, confusion, ataxia, and right-sided weakness. A CT scan reveals multiple ring-enhancing brain lesions and further imaging identifies a mass in the right upper lobe of the lung. What is the most likely primary source of brain metastases?",

      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: C) Lung cancer Explanation: Lung cancer is the most common cause of brain metastases, accounting for 40-50% of all cases. It is the leading cause of brain metastases, particularly in patients with a history of smoking by hematogenous spread. Symptoms include worsening headaches, confusion, and balance issues, which are consistent with brain metastases. The presence of multiple ring-enhancing brain lesions is typical of metastatic brain disease. Colorectal cancer (Option A) : Less commonly metastasises to the brain, typically affecting the liver, lungs, and bones. Prostate cancer (Option B) : Rarely spreads to the brain, with metastases usually found in bones, lymph nodes, and the liver. Melanoma (Option D) has a high propensity for brain metastasis but is less common overall than lung cancer. It typically metastasises to lymph nodes and the liver.
