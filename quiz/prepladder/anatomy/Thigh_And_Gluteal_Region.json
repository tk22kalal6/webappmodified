      "explanation": "Correct Answer: C) Calcaneum Explanation: Each longitudinal arch has: (a) two pillars, (b) a summit, and (c) joints. Medial Longitudinal Arch The medial longitudinal arch is made up of the calcaneum, talus, navicular, three cuneiform bones, and the medial three metatarsals. a) Pillars: The medial half of the calcaneum forms the posterior pillar of the medial longitudinal arch. The heads of the medial three metatarsals form the anterior pillar of the arch. b) Summit: The talus is located at the highest point (summit) of this arch and acts as its keystone. c) Joints: The main joints involved in the medial longitudinal arch are the talocalcaneonavicular joint and the subtalar joint. Lateral Longitudinal Arch The lateral longitudinal arch is formed by the calcaneum, cuboid, and lateral two metatarsals. It is low and nearly touches the ground, helping to support body weight during walking and running. a) Pillars: The posterior pillar is formed by the lateral tubercle of the calcaneum. The anterior pillar is formed by the heads of the lateral two metatarsals. b) Summit: The summit is at the level of the articular facets on the superior surface of the calcaneum, near the subtalar joint. c) Joints: The main joint is the calcaneocuboid joint. The arch is lower and less flexible than the medial arch, designed to transmit weight and thrust. Reference:",

      "explanation": "Correct Answer: A) Linea semilunaris Explanation: The linea semilunaris is a curved groove that runs from the tip of the 9th costal cartilage to the pubic tubercle. It is located a few centimeters lateral to the midline and corresponds to the outer border of the rectus abdominis muscle. Linea alba (Option B): The linea alba is a tendinous raphe that separates the two rectus muscles. This midline groove divides the anterior abdominal wall into two halves, right and left. Spino-umbilical Line (Option C): Also known as the McBurney’s line, is an imaginary line that extends from the umbilicus to the anterior superior iliac spine (ASIS) . The point at the junction of medial 2/3rd and lateral 1/3rd of this line corresponds to the McBurney’s point. The base of the appendix lies deep to this point, and it is commonly used in diagnosing acute appendicitis , as tenderness in this area is a key clinical sign. Addison’s plane (Option D): Also known as the Transpyloric Plane, is an imaginary horizontal plane that passes through the midpoint of the line connecting the suprasternal notch to the pubic symphysis.",

      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: A) L5 Explanation : Foot Drop indicates weakness in dorsiflexion , primarily controlled by the L5 nerve root through the deep peroneal nerve . The L5 dermatome supplies sensation to the dorsum of the foot and the 1st web space between the great toe and the 2nd toe. The patient's decreased sensation in these areas indicates L5 nerve root involvement. A herniated lumbar disc (most common type—paradiscal), particularly between L4-L5 > L5-S1, can compress the L5 nerve root , leading to the symptoms described. Dermatomes of the lower limb The area of skin supplied by a spinal nerve is termed a dermatome Lower Limb Innervation: Originates from the ventrolateral body wall opposite spinal segments L1–S3 . Primarily innervated by the ventral rami of these segments. Except the superomedial gluteal region is innervated by the dorsal rami of L1–L3 and S1–S3. Limb Bud Orientation: Initially it has preaxial (great toe) and postaxial (little toe) borders. The limb bud rotates medially by 90°, repositioning the great toe medially and the little toe laterally. After rotation, dermatomes are arranged: Preaxial border: L1–L4 (above downward).

Iliotibial tract: The iliotibial tract splits into two layers to enclose the tensor fasciae latae and gluteus maximus muscles. Between these muscles, it forms a thickened sheet called the gluteal aponeurosis, which also covers the gluteus medius. The superficial lamina attaches to the tubercle of the iliac crest. The deep lamina attaches to the capsule of the hip joint. Inferiorly, the tract attaches to a smooth area on the anterior surface of the lateral condyle of the tibia. Function : Stabilizes the knee both in extension and in partial flexion. Used during walking and running. When leaning forward with slightly flexed knees, the iliotibial tract supports the knee against gravity, preventing the individual from falling forward.

      "explanation": "Correct Answer: D) The uncompensated Trendelenburg sign is elicited with a walking patient the compensated is elicited in a walking patient. Tensor Fasciae Latae Gluteus Medius Gluteus Minimus Attachments Origin : Outer lip of the iliac crest extending from the anterior superior iliac spine to the tubercle of the crest. Insertion : Iliotibial tract 3–5 cm below the level of the greater trochanter. Origin: Gluteal surface of the ilium between anterior and posterior gluteal lines Insertion: Oblique ridge on the lateral surface of the greater trochanter. Origin: Gluteal surfaces of the ilium between anterior & inferior gluteal lines. Insertion: Anterior aspect of the Greater trochanter Relations Between gluteus medius and sartorius Covered by fascia lata Covered by gluteus maximus (posterior third) Deep to gluteus minimus Deep to gluteus medius Related to hip joint capsule Vascular Supply Mainly from lateral circumflex femoral artery Supplied by superior gluteal artery Deep branch of superior gluteal artery Trochanteric anastomosis Main trunk and deep branch of superior gluteal arter y Trochanteric anastomosis Innervation Superior gluteal nerve (L4, L5, S1) Superior gluteal nerve (L4, L5, S1) Superior gluteal nerve (L4, L5, S1) Actions Hip flexor and abductor Stabilizes pelvis Helps maintain extended knee Abducts thigh Medial & lateral rotation of thigh Supports pelvis during single-leg stance Abducts thigh Medial and lateral rotation of thigh Testing Depression below anterior superior iliac spine Abduction against resistance Medial rotation against resistance Abduction against resistance Medial rotation against resistance Abduction against resistance Trendelenberg sign: When the body's weight is balanced on one leg, the gluteal muscles on the supported side help elevate the opposite, unsupported side of the pelvis. However, if there is a malfunction in the abductor mechanism, the Sound side sinks (Option A) , which is referred to as a positive Trendelenburg sign (uncompensated). This sign indicates issues with hip abductors, such as paralysis of the gluteus medius and minimus (Option B) ; problems with the fulcrum, including congenital or pathological hip dislocations; and concerns related to body weight, such as an unhealed fracture of the femoral neck. When patients with the gluteus medius and minimus paralysis walk, they have a characteristic lurching gait (Option C) ie, during the single leg supporting phase of walking, there is leaning of the trunk to the affected side known as the compensated Trendelenburg sign . Duck waddling gait is seen when both the sides are affected.",

      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: B) Hamstrings; sciatic nerve Explanation : The hamstrings , innervated by the sciatic nerve , are responsible for knee flexion and hip extension. A fracture of the ischial tuberosity can affect the attachment site of these muscles. Sciatic nerve Size and Origin: Thickest nerve in the body (1.5 to 2 cm wide). Arises from the sacral plexus in the pelvis. Components: Tibial Part : Formed by ventral divisions of anterior primary rami (L4, L5, S1, S2, S3). Common Peroneal Part : Formed by dorsal divisions of anterior primary rami (L4, L5, S1, S2). Course: Begins in the pelvis, in front of the piriformis muscle. Exits the pelvis through the greater sciatic foramen below the piriformis. Divides into tibial and common peroneal nerves at the superior angle of the popliteal fossa. Relations: Deep Relations: Ischium, tendon of obturator internus, quadratus femoris, adductor magnus. Superficial Relations : Gluteus maximus (in the gluteal region) and long head of biceps femoris (in the thigh). Branches: Articular branches to the hip joint (gluteal region) . Muscular branches (Option B) The tibial part supplies the semitendinosus, the semimembranosus, the long head of the biceps femoris, and the ischial head of the adductor magnus (medial side) The common peroneal part supplies only a short head of biceps femoris (lateral side). Clinical Correlation: Compression against the femur can cause \"sleeping foot,\" resulting in lower limb paresthesia when sitting for long periods. Quadriceps; femoral nerve (Option A) : Quadriceps extend the knee, not flex it. Adductors; obturator nerve (Option C) : Adductors handle hip adduction, not knee flexion or hip extension. Gluteal muscles; superior gluteal nerve (Option D) : Gluteal muscles control hip abduction, not knee flexion or hip extension.",

        "A": "Posterior Femoral Cutaneous Nerve",
        "B": "Tibial nerve",
        "C": "Common peroneal nerve",
        "D": "Pudendal nerve"
      },
      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: C) Common peroneal nerve Explanation: Common peroneal nerve branches from the sciatic nerve and innervates the muscles responsible for dorsiflexion of the foot (e.g., tibialis anterior is supplied by deep peroneal nerve, which is a branch of common peroneal nerve). Injury to this nerve often results in foot drop. Sacral Plexus: The sacral plexus is a complex network of nerves formed by the anterior rami (ventral rami) of the L4, L5, S1, S2, and S3 spinal nerves, with some contributions from S4. It is located on the posterior wall of the pelvis, resting on the anterior surface of the piriformis muscle. The sacral plexus plays a critical role in providing motor and sensory innervation to parts of the pelvis, perineum, and lower limbs. Root Values and Divisions Root Values: L4 to S4 contribute to the sacral plexus. Divisions: Anterior Division: Primarily supplies muscles involved in flexion and related functions. Posterior Division: Supplies muscles associated with extension and related movements. Major Nerves of the Sacral Plexus Nerve Formation Pathway Functions Sciatic Nerve The largest nerve in the body, derived from both anterior and posterior divisions of L4, L5, S1, S2, and S3. Exits the pelvis through the greater sciatic foramen, passing beneath the piriformis muscle, and travels down the posterior thigh. Supplies the posterior thigh muscles. It divides into two key branches: Tibial Nerve (Anterior Division) (Option B): Innervates the posterior leg and foot muscles. Common Peroneal Nerve (Posterior Division): Innervates muscles of the lateral and anterior leg. Clinical Note : Injury to the common peroneal nerve can result in foot drop, a condition characterized by difficulty lifting the front part of the foot. Pudendal Nerve (Option D) Arises from the anterior divisions of S2, S3, and S4. Travels out of the pelvis through the greater sciatic foramen and into the perineum via the lesser sciatic foramen. Provides motor and sensory innervation to the perineum, including muscles of the pelvic floor and external genitalia. It is crucial for maintaining continence and sexual function. Superior Gluteal Nerve Originates from the posterior divisions of L4, L5, and S1. Exits the pelvis via the greater sciatic foramen, superior to the piriformis muscle. Innervates the gluteus medius, gluteus minimus, and tensor fasciae latae, which are responsible for hip abduction and pelvis stabilization during walking. Inferior Gluteal Nerve Originates from the posterior divisions of L5, S1, and S2. Exits the pelvis through the greater sciatic foramen, inferior to the piriformis. Innervates the gluteus maximus, the primary extensor of the hip joint. Posterior Femoral Cutaneous Nerve (Option A) Arises from the anterior and posterior divisions of S1, S2, and S3. Travels alongside the sciatic nerve, exiting the pelvis through the greater sciatic foramen. Provides sensory innervation to the skin on the posterior thigh and lower buttocks. Minor Nerves of the Sacral Plexus Nerve to Piriformis (S1, S2) : Supplies the piriformis muscle, which assists in lateral rotation of the hip. Nerve to Quadratus Femoris (L4, L5, S1) : Innervates the quadratus femoris and inferior gemellus muscles, responsible for lateral hip rotation and stabilization. Nerve to Obturator Internus (L5, S1, S2): Innervates the obturator internus and superior gemellus muscles, involved in lateral rotation of the thigh.

        "D": "L4 and L5"
      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: B) L2 and L3 Explanation: Based on the clinical scenario, the patient's symptoms align with meralgia paresthetica, marked by tingling and numbness in the outer thigh that worsens with prolonged sitting and improves with standing or walking. This condition results from compression of the lateral femoral cutaneous nerve, which is primarily derived from the dorsal divisions of the L2 and L3 nerve roots. Lumbar Plexus: The lumbar plexus is a network of nerves formed by the anterior rami (ventral rami) of the lumbar spinal nerves, specifically L1 to L4. It is located within the psoas major muscle in the posterior abdominal wall. The lumbar plexus is responsible for providing motor and sensory innervation to the pelvic region and the lower limb. Division of Roots The roots of the lumbar plexus can be categorised into two main divisions: Anterior Division: Comprising roots that generally supply flexor muscles and associated sensory areas. Posterior Division: Comprising roots that typically supply extensor muscles and their corresponding sensory territories. Major Nerves of the Lumbar Plexus Nerve Formation Pathway Functions Obturator Nerve Formed from the ventral divisions of L2, L3, and L4. It exits the pelvis through the obturator foramen. Innervates the muscles of the medial thigh (adductors) and provides sensory innervation to the skin of the medial thigh. Femoral Nerve Formed from the dorsal divisions of L2, L3, and L4. (Option C) It passes under the inguinal ligament into the anterior compartment of the thigh. Supplies the muscles of the anterior thigh (such as quadriceps) and provides sensory innervation to the anterior thigh and part of the medial leg. Lateral Femoral Cutaneous Nerve Formed from the dorsal divisions of L2 and L3. It courses laterally across the iliacus muscle and under the inguinal ligament. Provides purely sensory innervation to the skin over the lateral aspect of the thigh. This nerve is particularly important in conditions such as meralgia paresthetica, where it can become compressed, leading to tingling and pain in the outer thigh. Most commonly injured during Mc Roberts manure & Laproscopic hernia surgery. Proximal Nerves: Iliohypogastric Nerve (L1) Function: Supplies the skin over the lower abdomen and contributes to abdominal muscle innervation. Most common nerve entrapped in open inguinal hernia surgery, leads to the common cause of pain syndrome. Ilioinguinal Nerve (L1) Function: Provides sensory innervation to the skin of the groin, part of the thigh, root of the penis, clitoris, and anterior I of the scrotum. Genitofemoral Nerve (L1, L2) (Option A) Branches: Genital Branch: Supplies the cremaster muscle and the skin of the scrotum in males, and the labia majora in females. Efferent for cremasteric reflex. It is injured in open hernia repair. Femoral Branch: Supplies the skin of the upper anterior thigh. Afferent for cremasteric reflex. It is anesthetized in femoral vein catheterization. Lumbosacral Trunk (L4, L5) (Option D) Function: Contributes to the formation of the sacral plexus, which innervates the lower limb.",
