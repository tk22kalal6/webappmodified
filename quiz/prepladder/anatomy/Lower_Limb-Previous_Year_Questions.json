      "explanation": "Correct Answer: B) 1 Explanation: The gluteus medius is essential for stabilizing the pelvis during walking. Injury to this muscle or its innervation (superior gluteal nerve) leads to a lurching gait (Trendelenburg gait) where the patient compensates by shifting weight toward the affected side to prevent pelvic drop. Gluteus Muscles and Trendelenburg Gait Tensor Fasciae Latae Gluteus Medius Gluteus Minimus Attachments Origin : Outer lip of the iliac crest extending from the anterior superior iliac spine to the tubercle of the crest. Insertion : Iliotibial tract 3–5 cm below the level of the greater trochanter. Origin: Gluteal surface of the ilium between anterior and posterior gluteal lines Insertion: Oblique ridge on the lateral surface of the greater trochanter. Origin: Gluteal surfaces of the ilium between anterior & inferior gluteal lines. Insertion: Anterior aspect of the Greater trochanter Relations Between gluteus medius and sartorius Covered by fascia lata Covered by gluteus maximus (posterior third) Deep to gluteus minimus Deep to gluteus medius Related to hip joint capsule Vascular Supply Mainly from lateral circumflex femoral artery Supplied by superior gluteal artery Deep branch of superior gluteal artery Trochanteric anastomosis Main trunk and deep branch of superior gluteal arter y Trochanteric anastomosis Innervation Superior gluteal nerve (L4, L5, S1) Superior gluteal nerve (L4, L5, S1) Superior gluteal nerve (L4, L5, S1) Actions Hip flexor and abductor Stabilizes pelvis Helps maintain extended knee Abducts thigh Medial & lateral rotation of thigh Supports pelvis during single-leg stance Abducts thigh Medial and lateral rotation of thigh Testing Depression below anterior superior iliac spine Abduction against resistance Medial rotation against resistance Abduction against resistance Medial rotation against resistance Abduction against resistance Trendelenberg sign: When the body's weight is balanced on one leg, the gluteal muscles on the supported side help elevate the opposite, unsupported side of the pelvis.

      "explanation": "(L3-L4) that supplies sensation to the medial leg and foot . During coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) , the great saphenous vein (GSV) is commonly harvested for the bypass procedure. Since the saphenous nerve runs alongside the GSV in the leg, it is highly susceptible to injury during vein harvesting, leading to paresthesia and sensory loss over the medial aspect of the leg and foot . Superficial peroneal nerve (option A): Provides sensory innervation to the anterolateral lower leg and dorsum of the foot . Unlikely to be affected in CABG as it is located in the lateral compartment of the leg. Femoral nerve (option C): Provides motor innervation to the anterior thigh muscles and sensory innervation to the anterior and medial thigh . Injury would cause weakness of quadriceps and loss of knee jerk reflex , which is not described in the question. Sural nerve (option D): Provides sensory innervation to the lateral foot and posterolateral calf . Not involved in medial leg and foot sensation, making it an unlikely option.

      "explanation": "between the medial malleolus and Achilles tendon/tendocalcaneous. Locate the medial malleolus (the bony bump on the inside of the ankle). Place your index and middle fingers on the inside of the ankle and move your fingers behind the medial malleolus towards the back of the leg. You should be able to feel the posterior tibial artery pulsations in this area. Incorrect Options: Option A - Anterior tibial artery: To palpate the anterior tibial artery, ask the patient to lie down or sit with their legs slightly bent. Locate the ankle bones (medial malleolus and lateral malleolus) and identify the space between them. Place your index and middle fingers on the space between the ankle bones and move your fingers upwards towards the top of the foot. You should be able to feel the anterior tibial artery pulsations in this area. Option C - Dorsalis pedis artery: To palpate the dorsalis pedis artery, ask the patient to lie down or sit with their legs slightly bent. Locate the first and second metatarsal bones (the bones that connect to the big toe). Place your index and middle fingers on the top of the foot, just below the space between the first and second metatarsal bones, you can feel the pulsations there. Option D - Popliteal artery: To palpate the popliteal artery, ask the patient to lie down on their stomach or to sit with their legs hanging off the edge of the exam table. Flex the knee to about 90 degrees. Use your fingers to locate the popliteal fossa, which is the small depression behind the knee joint. Feel for the pulsation of the artery in the middle of the fossa. Press your fingers gently into the popliteal fossa and feel for the pulsation of the artery. Reference: .",

      "question": "What is the ligament that links the medial cuneiform bone to the base of the second metatarsal bone?",
      "options": {
        "A": "Chopart",
        "B": "Spring",
        "C": "Lisfranc",
        "D": "Deltoid"
      },
      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "of the second metatarsal . It is a strong oblique ligament that stabilises the tarsometatarsal (TMT) joint and prevents excessive movement between the midfoot and forefoot . Injury to this ligament leads to a Lisfranc injury , which involves displacement of the second metatarsal and can result in significant midfoot instability. Anatomy : The Lisfranc joint is formed by the metatarsal bones (M1 to M5) and the tarsal bones (cuneiform C1 to C3 and cuboid). The Lisfranc ligament is a 3 part structure that joins the medial cuneiform to the 2nd metatarsal . Interdigitating joints and strong ligaments support the five tarsometatarsal (TMT) joints. The second metatarsal base fits into a recess formed by the medial, intermediate, and lateral cuneiforms. Injury Mechanism : Dislocations are rare and typically arise from twisting or crushing injuries , with the foot buckling at the midfoot–forefoot junction. Often considered high-energy injuries , leading to extensive damage to the foot. The direction of forefoot dislocation is not useful for treatment guidance or outcome prediction. Clinical Features: Suspect TMT dislocation or fracture-dislocation in patients with foot pain and swelling after high-velocity impacts (e.g., car accidents, falls). About 20–30% of these injuries are initially missed. Obvious deformity usually only occurs with severe injuries. Imaging: X-rays : Interpretation can be challenging; systematic examination is crucial. Focus on the alignment of the second and fourth metatarsals (oblique view): The medial edge of the second metatarsal should align with the medial edge of the second cuneiform. The medial edge of the fourth metatarsal should align with the medial side of the cuboid. A true lateral view may show dorsal displacement of the second metatarsal base . Advanced Imaging : If fracture-dislocation is suspected, stress views may help, but a CT scan is more effective for assessing the extent of injury. Treatment: Undisplaced Sprains : Require 4–6 weeks of cast or boot immobilization. Subluxation or Dislocation : Accurate reduction is necessary, often achieved through traction and manipulation under anesthesia. The position is stabilized with percutaneous K-wires or screws, followed by cast immobilization (non-weight-bearing for 6–8 weeks). Open Reduction : If closed reduction fails, open reduction is essential. Exposure of the second metatarsal base via a longitudinal incision for joint manipulation. Fixation with K-wires or screws, followed by immobilization. Complications: Compartment Syndrome : A tense, swollen foot may indicate serious compartment syndrome. Measure intracompartmental pressures if suspected. Prompt decompression through surgical incisions is critical; the wound is left open until swelling subsides. Chopart ligament (option A): Related to the Chopart joint , which is the midtarsal (transverse tarsal) joint , connecting the hindfoot (talus and calcaneus) to the midfoot (navicular and cuboid). Not involved in the medial cuneiform–second metatarsal connection . Spring ligament (option B): Also called the plantar calcaneonavicular ligament , it connects the calcaneus to the navicular and supports the medial longitudinal arch of the foot. Does not link the medial cuneiform to the second metatarsal. Deltoid ligament (option D): A strong medial ankle ligament , stabilising the talus within the ankle mortise. It is unrelated to the tarsometatarsal joints .",

      "explanation": "medial side of the foot , between the talus (posteriorly) and the cuneiform bones (anteriorly) . The X-ray shows a lateral view of the foot, with the navicular bone labeled in its characteristic position between the talus and the midfoot structures. Tarsal Bones and Their Positions Bone Group Bones Description & Function Tarsals Provide mechanical support and structure to the foot. Proximal Group Talus Transmits body weight to the foot. Articulates at three joints: Superiorly: Ankle joint (tibia/fibula) Inferiorly: Subtalar joint (calcaneus) Anteriorly: Talonavicular joint (navicular) Calcaneus Largest tarsal bone, forms the heel. Articulates at two joints: Superiorly: Subtalar joint (talus) Anteriorly: Calcaneocuboid joint (cuboid) Intermediate Group Navicular Boat-shaped; articulates with talus, cuneiforms, and cuboid. Has a tuberosity for tibialis posterior tendon attachment. Distal Group Cuboid Lateral; articulates with calcaneus and fourth/fifth metatarsals. Features a groove for fibularis longus tendon. Cuneiforms (3) Medial, intermediate, lateral; wedge-shaped. Help form the transverse arch; attach to various muscles. Metatarsals I-V (1-5) Connect tarsals to phalanges; numbered medial to lateral. Have a head, neck, shaft, and base; facilitate movement and support. Phalanges Great Toe: 2 (proximal, distal) Toes 2-5: 3 each (proximal, intermediate, distal). Each phalanx has a base, shaft, and head; provide structure to toes. Calcaneus (Option A): Incorrect because the calcaneus is located posteriorly and is the largest tarsal bone forming the heel. Cuboid (Option B): Incorrect because the cuboid is on the lateral side of the foot, articulating with the 4th and 5th metatarsals. Talus (Option D): Incorrect because the talus is superior to the navicular, articulating with the tibia and fibula to form the ankle joint.",

      "question": "The prevention of lateral dislocation of the patella during knee flexion is by-",
      "options": {
        "A": "Vastus medialis",
        "B": "Patellar ligament",
        "C": "Gracilis",
        "D": "Rectus femoris"

      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: A) Vastus Medialis Explanation: The vastus medialis , particularly its oblique fibers (VMO - Vastus Medialis Obliquus) , plays a crucial role in preventing lateral dislocation of the patella by exerting a medial pull on the patella during knee flexion. This counteracts the lateral pull of the quadriceps , especially the vastus lateralis . Patellar Stability and Dislocation Prevention Structure Role in Patellar Stability Vastus Medialis (VMO) Exerts a medial pull on the patella, preventing lateral displacement Patellar Ligament Connects the patella to the tibial tuberosity but does not prevent lateral dislocation Gracilis A medial thigh muscle responsible for hip adduction, not involved in patellar stability Rectus Femoris A major knee extensor, but does not prevent lateral displacement Patellar Ligament (Option B): Incorrect because it primarily stabilizes the patella in the superior-inferior direction, not against lateral forces. Gracilis (Option C): Incorrect because it is a medial thigh muscle involved in hip adduction and does not influence patellar stability. Rectus Femoris (Option D): Incorrect because it is a knee extensor , contributing to overall quadriceps function but not directly preventing lateral patellar displacement.
