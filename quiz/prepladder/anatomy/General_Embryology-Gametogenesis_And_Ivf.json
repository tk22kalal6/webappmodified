Thus, a bivalent consists of four chromatids - tetrad (Crossing over occurs where the two central chromatids coil and cross at several points called chiasmata). Diplotene: The two chromosomes of the bivalent begin to separate. Chromatids involved in crossing over break at the chiasmata, and the \"loose\" pieces attach to the opposite chromatid. Diakinesis: Final stage of prophase 1 Chromosomes continue to condense, and the nuclear envelope breaks down. Homologous chromosomes are still attached at the chiasmata, which begin to move towards the ends of the chromosomes (terminalization). Spindle fibers start to form in preparation for metaphase I.",

Chromosomes get arranged as a metaphase plate in the equator of the cells - midway between the 2 centrioles → Chromosome’s centromeres get attached to microtubules of the spindle via kinetochores. Kinetochore fibers pull the chromosomes toward the poles, creating tension through the cohesin complex. The tension indicates that the sister chromatids have achieved proper biorientation. The cell monitors the attachment of microtubules to chromosomes and possibly the tension generated by the microtubules.

        "D": "None of the above"
      },
      "correct_answer": "D",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: D) None of the above. Explanation: In telophase, chromosomes unwind and return to a less condensed chromatin state. Telophase is the concluding stage of both mitosis and meiosis, following the movement of chromatids to the spindle poles. It is essential for ensuring that each daughter cell inherits an identical chromosome set, preserving genetic continuity in cell divisions. Key events in this phase include: Chromosome Relaxation : The chromatids start to unwind and revert to chromatin, becoming less distinct under a microscope. Nuclear Envelope Reassembly: A new nuclear membrane forms around each set of separated chromatids, resulting in two distinct nuclei. Spindle Breakdown: The spindle fibers, responsible for chromosome movement, are disassembled. Cytokinesis Begins: While telophase focuses on nuclear changes, it often coincides with cytokinesis, where the cytoplasm splits, producing two daughter cells. Chromatids condense into chromosomes (Option A) : This event occurs in prophase , not telophase. During prophase, chromatin condenses to form visible chromosomes. Nuclear envelope disintegrates (Option B) : This event happens in prophase , where the nuclear membrane breaks down to allow spindle fibers access to the chromosomes. In telophase, the nuclear envelope re-forms. Chromatids are pulled towards the spindle poles (Option C) : This occurs in anaphase when the chromatids are separated and moved to opposite ends of the cell by the spindle fibers.

      "explanation": "Correct Answer: A) D only Explanation : The luteinizing hormone (LH) surge plays a crucial role in the menstrual cycle, preceding ovulation. The LH surge is essential for triggering ovulation, with its peak closely preceding the release of the egg. The surge is triggered by a significant rise in estradiol , produced by the dominant follicle, typically larger than 15mm on ultrasound. (Statement C) While the LH surge happens about 36 hours before ovulation, the LH surge peaks 10-12 hours before ovulation , making it a useful marker for timing ovulation (Statement A) It stimulates luteinization of granulosa cells , promotes progesterone production, and prompts the oocyte to resume meiosis, leading to the release of the first polar body. (Statement B) Surges with multiple peaks are linked to smaller follicle sizes before rupture and lower LH levels on the day of ovulation.

      "correct_answer": "D",
      "explanation": "maternal age. Correct Answer: D) Preimplantation genetic testing (PGT) is necessary for women of advanced maternal age. Explanation : IVF provides a solution for women with bilateral tubal blockage, a condition in which both fallopian tubes are blocked, preventing natural conception. Mechanism : IVF bypasses the fallopian tubes by directly retrieving eggs from the ovaries, fertilizing them in a lab, and transferring the embryos into the uterus. Surgical Considerations : Women with severe tubal damage may undergo bilateral salpingectomy (removal of both fallopian tubes) to improve IVF success rates by avoiding complications from dysfunctional tubes. (Option B ruled out) Success Rates: IVF success in cases of bilateral tubal blockage depends on factors like age, overall reproductive health, and egg/embryo quality. Despite these variables, IVF remains a highly effective treatment. (Option A ruled out) The main steps of IVF include: Controlled Ovarian Hyperstimulation : Most often done using injectable gonadotropins. After about 36 hours from a trigger shot or HCG injection, egg retrieval is performed using transvaginal ultrasound-guided aspiration. Fertilization: Retrieved eggs are placed in a special medium, and normal sperm is added for insemination. If sperm abnormalities are present, intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI) is used, where a single sperm is injected directly into the egg's cytoplasm. (Option C ruled out) Embryo Assessment: After fertilization, embryos are assessed and graded. Transfer usually occurs on Day 3 or Day 5. Preimplantation Genetic Testing (PGT): It’s a procedure used to detect genetic mutations, chromosomal translocations, or aneuploidy (abnormal number of chromosomes). It’s especially useful in cases of advanced maternal age, recurrent IVF failures, recurrent pregnancy loss, or unexplained infertility.

      "explanation": "Correct answer : B) Primary spermatocyte to secondary spermatocyte Explanation : Independent assortment is the random distribution of chromosomes It occurs at Meiosis 1 where there is division from primary spermatocyte to secondary spermatocyte. It states that genes located on different chromosomes are inherited independently of each other. In other words, the allele a parent passes on for one trait does not affect the allele passed on for another trait. During Metaphase I of meiosis, the homologous chromosomes line up in pairs at the cell's equator. The orientation of each chromosome pair is random, meaning the maternal or paternal chromosome can go into either of the two daughter cells.This random alignment is the basis of independent assortment . Independent assortment is a key factor in genetic variation. This prevents all chromosomes from the same source ending up in the same gamete.",

First level is the organiser that induces the development of new tissues. This newly developed tissue can then induce another tissue to become secondary organisers.
