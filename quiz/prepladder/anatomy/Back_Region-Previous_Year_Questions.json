      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: A) Spinal accessory nerve Explanation: The movement shown in the image is shrugging, which is carried out by the trapezius muscles and supplied by the spinal accessory nerve. Lesion of the accessory nerve or paralysis of the trapezius leads to drooping of shoulders and difficulty in shrugging and weakness of overhead abduction. Trapezius Origin: Occipital bone and cervicothoracic spine Insertion: Scapula Bone and Clavicle Three sets of fiber: Upper: Insertion on clavicle (lateral 1/3posterior side) Middle: Insertion on acromion process anteriorly Lower: Insertion on the spine of the scapula Nerve Supply: Accessory nerve (CN XI) Action: Elevation (upper fiber) and depression (lower fiber) Retractor (Midline) Rotates the Glenoid cavity superiorly. Long thoracic nerve (Option B): Supplies serratus anterior, which is responsible for scapular",

      "question": "The movements at the _______ joint permit a person to look to the right and left",
      "options": {
        "A": "Atlanto-occipital",
        "B": "Atlanto -axial",
        "C": "C2-C3",

      "explanation": "vertebra) and the axis (C2 vertebra) in the spine. This joint is responsible for rotational movements of the head. The axis (C2) has a peg-like structure called the dens or odontoid process, which fits into the atlas (C1), allowing for rotation. Therefore, the Atlanto-axial joint permits the specific movements required for looking to the right and left. Incorrect Options: Option A - Atlanto-occipital joint The Atlanto-occipital joint permits flexion and extension movements of the head, like nodding. It's mainly for tilting the head forward and backward, rather than side-to-side rotation. Option C - C2-C3 intervertebral joint The C2-C3 intervertebral joint permits flexion, extension, lateral bending, and some degree of rotation, but sideways rotation is mainly handled by the Atlanto-axial joint, not C2-C3. Option D - C3-C4 intervertebral joint The C3-C4 joint, similar to C2-C3, allows neck movements like flexion, extension, lateral bending, and some degree of rotation. However, it's not directly involved in sideways rotational movements.",

      "explanation": "back and neck. It plays a key role in the movement and stabilization of the scapula. The middle and lower fibers of the trapezius muscle primarily perform scapular retraction, which involves pulling the scapula backward toward the spine. Incorrect Options: Option A - Serratus anterior: The serratus anterior muscle protracts and rotates the scapula, stabilizing it against the rib cage. However, it doesn't directly retract the scapula at the sternoclavicular joint. Option C - Subscapularis: The subscapularis muscle, part of the rotator cuff, sits on the front of the scapula. It internally rotates the humerus and stabilizes the shoulder joint but doesn't aid in scapular retraction. Option D - Supraspinatus: The supraspinatus muscle, part of the rotator cuff, is located on the back of the scapula. It helps initiate shoulder abduction but isn't mainly responsible for scapular retraction.",

      "question": "What is the cause of scapular winging?",
      "options": {
        "A": "Trapezius",
        "B": "Serratus anterior",
        "C": "Latissimus dorsi",

      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "responsible for stabilizing the scapula against the thoracic wall. When the serratus anterior muscle is paralyzed or weakened, it can lead to winging of the scapula. This muscle is especially important for maintaining proper scapular position during movements such as pushing, pulling, and reaching. Hence, option B is correct. Incorrect Options: Option A - Trapezius: The trapezius muscle stabilizes and moves the scapula, but its paralysis typically doesn't cause scapular winging. Option C - Latissimus dorsi: The latissimus dorsi muscle assists in various shoulder movements but is typically not associated with scapular winging, even when weakened or paralyzed. Option D - Pectoralis major: The pectoralis major muscle aids shoulder movements but usually doesn't cause scapular winging if paralyzed.",

      "explanation": "spinal stability and flexibility. Elastin fibers within it provide elasticity, enabling stretching and recoiling to maintain stability during movement. Its yellowish color comes from high elastin levels. Incorrect Options: Option A - Type 1 collagen: Type 1 collagen is abundant in tendons, ligaments, and bone, but the ligamentum flavum contains lower levels compared to other connective tissues. Option B - Type 2 collagen: Type 2 collagen is primarily found in hyaline cartilage, like in joint articular cartilage and vertebral discs, but it's not notably present in the ligamentum flavum. Option C - Reticular fibers: Reticular fibers, composed of type 3 collagen, form mesh-like networks in organs like lymph nodes and spleen, but they're not notably present in the ligamentum flavum.

        "C": "Lordosis",

      "explanation": "concave shape. In the lumbar spine, lordosis is considered a normal anatomical feature. It helps to maintain the balance and proper alignment of the spine, allowing for efficient weight distribution and movement. Incorrect Options: Option A - Scoliosis: Scoliosis is an abnormal sideways curvature of the spine, typically found in the thoracic or thoracolumbar regions, not the lumbar spine. Option B - Kyphosis: Kyphosis is an excessive forward curvature of the spine, often causing a rounded or hunched-back appearance. While normal in the thoracic spine, it's uncommon in the lumbar spine. Option D - Recurvatum: Recurvatum is hyperextension of a joint, seen notably in the knee but not typically in the lumbar spine.",
