      "explanation": "Correct Answer: D) Thymus Explanation: The image shows a distinct lobulated structure with a darker outer cortex and a lighter inner medulla. This is characteristic of the thymus. Parts of the Thymus: Cortex : The outer, more densely packed region of the thymus. Filled with immature T cells (thymocytes) , undergoing differentiation and maturation as they move towards the medulla. The cortex contains thymic nurse cells that support the maturing thymocytes. T cells express surface markers (like TCR, CD3, CD4, and CD8) during maturation. Macrophages are present to phagocytose apoptotic T cells, which fail to mature properly. Medulla : The inner, less densely populated region. Dominated by epithelial cells with pale-staining nuclei and large cytoplasm. Contains Hassall's corpuscles , concentric structures made of keratinized epithelial cells, involved in T cell regulation. Dendritic cells and macrophages in the medulla present self-antigens to maturing T cells, ensuring the elimination of self-reactive cells to prevent autoimmunity. Histology of the Thymus: Epithelial Framework : Throughout the thymus, epithelial cells provide a structural scaffold for lymphocyte development and produce hormones like thymopoietin, which regulate T cell maturation and proliferation. It is divided into lobules by connective tissue septa. A protective blood-thymus barrier prevents antigens from entering, safeguarding T cell maturation. With age, the thymus undergoes involution , where lymphoid tissue is replaced by fat, but it continues",

They have extensive dendritic trees that branch into the molecular layer and receive synaptic inputs from parallel fibers (granule cells) . These cells serve as the primary output neurons of the cerebellar cortex, sending inhibitory signals (GABAergic) to the deep cerebellar nuclei . The cerebellar cortex consists of the following three distinct layers: Layers of the cerebellar cortex Molecular (plexiform) layer Purkinje cell layer Granular layer It primarily contains numerous dendritic branches from Purkinje cells, with relatively few widely spaced nerve cells. It consists of a single row of large flask-shaped cells, the Purkinje cells . The inner granular layer is made up of many closely packed small granule cells , along with a few larger Golgi cells. These nerve cells are of two types: (a) Basket cells (b) Stellate cells. The axons of Purkinje cells are the only output from the cerebellar cortex and have an inhibitory effect on the intracerebellar nuclei.

      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: B) Terminal bronchioles Explanation: Terminal bronchioles differ from larger bronchi as they are devoid of cartilage in their walls. The ciliated cells are still present in terminal bronchioles, but their abundance is reduced. Additionally, terminal bronchioles exhibit alveolar outgrowths, marking the transition to structures involved in gas exchange. Respiratory bronchus (Option A): Respiratory bronchioles have alveoli budding directly from their walls. This is a distinctive feature that indicates their role in gas exchange. Epithelium may become more cuboidal, eventually transitioning to simple squamous epithelium in the alveoli. Similar to terminal bronchioles, respiratory bronchioles lack cartilage in their walls. Alveolar sac (Option C): Alveolar sacs are composed of clusters of alveoli, which are small, balloon-like structures. Alveolar walls are extremely thin to facilitate efficient gas exchange. Intrapulmonary bronchus (Option D): Intrapulmonary bronchi have smooth muscle in their walls, which helps regulate airflow. Goblet cells, found in the epithelium of intrapulmonary bronchi, secrete mucus to aid in capturing particles and facilitating their expulsion from the respiratory tract. Cartilage found in the intrapulmonary bronchus helps maintain the shape of the bronchi, preserving the integrity of the airway structure.",

      "explanation": "gland gland: A - Eccrine Sweat Gland: Eccrine sweat glands are responsible for thermoregulation and are found throughout the body, primarily in the palms, soles, and forehead. They are characterized by their tubular structure and are often found deep in the dermis. B - Arrector Pilorum: These are small muscles attached to hair follicles. When they contract, they cause the hair to stand up, commonly known as piloerection. They are typically found alongside hair follicles. C - Sebaceous Gland: Sebaceous glands are responsible for producing sebum, an oily substance that lubricates the skin and hair. They are usually associated with hair follicles and appear as small clusters of cells in the dermis. D - Apocrine Gland: Apocrine sweat glands are primarily found in the axillary and genital regions. They secrete a thicker, milky fluid into hair follicles and are involved in scent production. These glands are larger than eccrine glands and have a more complex structure. Incorrect Options: Options B, C, and D: These options are incorrectly matched.",

      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: C) Purkinje cell Explanation: The marked area in the image is a Purkinje cell. The cerebellar cortex consists of the following three distinct layers: Layers of the cerebellar cortex Molecular (plexiform) layer (Options A, B) Purkinje cell layer Granular layer (Option D) It primarily contains numerous dendritic branches from Purkinje cells, with relatively few widely spaced nerve cells. It consists of a single row of large flask-shaped cells, the Purkinje cells . The inner granular layer is made up of many closely packed small granule cells , along with a few larger Golgi cells. These nerve cells are of two types: (a) Basket cells (b) Stellate cells. The axons of Purkinje cells are the only output from the cerebellar cortex and have an inhibitory effect on the intracerebellar nuclei. Golgi cells are inhibitory while the granular cells are excitatory. Among the five types of intrinsic neurons (Basket cells, Stellate cells, Purkinje cells, Granule cells and Golgi cells)- All are inhibitory except granule cells.",

        "C": "Articular cartilage",
        "D": "Fibrocartilage"

      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: A) Hyaline cartilage Explanation: The image shows a glassy, bluish-white matrix with chondrocytes in lacunae Hyaline cartilage is the most common type. It has a glassy, translucent matrix due to the fine collagen fibrils. Chondrocytes (cartilage cells) are scattered throughout the matrix, often appearing in small groups (isogenous groups) within lacunae (spaces). Types of Cartilage Characteristic Hyaline Cartilage (Most Common) Elastic Cartilage (Yellow cartilage) (Option B) Fibrocartilage (Option D) Matrix appearance Homogeneous, basophilic Contains elastic fiber network Numerous collagen bundles Chondrocyte arrangement Groups (cell nests/isogenous groups) Similar to hyaline Single rows or isogenous groups Perichondrium Present (except in articular cartilage) Present Absent Main fiber type Type II collagen Elastic fibers Type I (primarily) and Type II collagen Main functions Structural support, forms articular surfaces Provides flexibility and resilience Resists compression and shearing, shock absorption Examples Costal cartilage, tracheal rings, articular cartilage Auricle, epiglottis, auditory tube Intervertebral discs, menisci Articular cartilage (Option C): Articular cartilage is a specific type of hyaline cartilage covering the bones' surfaces in synovial joints. While it is a form of hyaline cartilage, the term \"articular\" refers to its location rather than a different type of cartilage.",
