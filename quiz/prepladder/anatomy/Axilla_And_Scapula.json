Correct Answer: A) The cephalic vein pierces the clavipectoral fascia and runs through the deltopectoral groove before draining into the axillary vein. Explanation: The cephalic vein courses in the deltopectoral groove , then pierces the clavipectoral fascia to drain into the axillary vein .

It is critical in maintaining clavicular positioning , particularly during weight-bearing activities involving the upper limb. The clavicle is often fractured by an indirect fall on an outstretched hand . The most common fracture site is at the junction of its two curvatures, the weakest point . The lateral fragment is displaced downward due to the weight of the limb, as the trapezius muscle cannot fully support it.

      },
      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Correct answer: C) Long thoracic nerve Explanation: Winging of the scapula occurs due to paralysis or weakness of the serratus anterior muscle , which is innervated by the long thoracic nerve. The serratus anterior muscle normally holds the scapula against the thoracic wall. Damage to the long thoracic nerve results in a characteristic “winged” appearance of the scapula, especially when the patient pushes against a wall. Dorsal scapular nerve (Option A): Innervates the rhomboid major and minor and levator scapulae, which retract and elevate the scapula. Injury to this nerve does not cause winging of the scapula. Spinal accessory nerve (Option B): Innervates the trapezius muscle, which elevates and rotates the scapula. Damage leads to shoulder drooping and difficulty elevating the arm but does not cause scapular winging. Suprascapular nerve (Option D): Innervates the supraspinatus and infraspinatus muscles, which assist in shoulder abduction and external rotation. Injury affects shoulder movement, not scapular positioning. Reference: BD Chaurasia’s Human Anatomy, Volume 1, 8th Edition, Page 45,46,48,49",
