The neural tube gives rise to the CNS. Grey matter in the CNS consists of nerve cell bodies, called nuclei. (Option A) CNS white matter consists of myelinated axons and these axons form structures like tracts and fasciculi.

      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "which are involved in MS. Correct Answer: C) It is an extension of the diencephalon and myelinated by oligodendrocytes, which are involved in MS. Explanation: The optic nerve is part of the CNS because it develops as an extension of the diencephalon during embryological development. Unlike peripheral nerves, it is myelinated by oligodendrocytes, not Schwann cells. Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a demyelinating disease that affects oligodendrocytes , which are responsible for the myelination of CNS axons. Since the optic nerve is part of the CNS, it is susceptible to the demyelinating process in MS. Optic neuritis , which involves inflammation and demyelination of the optic nerve, is a common presenting symptom in MS, leading to vision loss and pain in eye movement . (Option A) Optic Nerve: Ganglion cell neurons in the retina collect visual information and transmit it towards the CNS via the optic nerve. Thus although being a peripheral nerve, the optic nerve is myelinated by oligodendrocytes- since it is a part of the CNS. (Option B) The optic nerve does not regenerate, making it more vulnerable to damage (Option D): The issue in MS is CNS demyelination, not the regeneration capacity.",

      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: A) 1 is correct Explanation: Neural plate → Neural groove → Neural tube describes the sequence of neural tube formation. The neural plate forms from ectoderm cells in the midline of the embryo around the 3rd week of development marking the beginning of primary neurulation. The neural plate bends to form the neural groove . The neural groove closes to form the neural tube , starting from the middle and moving toward both ends. Surface ectoderm forms above the neural tube. The neural tube elongates as cells narrow and stretches from head to tail. The first closure site forms in the rhombencephalic region and spreads in both directions. The second closure site forms in the prosencephalic region and extends caudally. The Rostral/ Anterior neuropore (top end) closes on day 25 when around 20 somites (segments) are present. (Statement 2) The Caudal/ Posterior neuropore (bottom end) closes around the level of the future second sacral vertebra on day 28 . (Statement 3)",

      },
      "correct_answer": "D",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: D) Directly gives rise to neurons in the Vestibulocochlear ganglion. Explanation: Otic Placodes are specific types of ectodermal placodes that form the inner ear structures. They invaginate to become otic vesicles, which eventually develop into the membranous labyrinth of the inner ear, including the cochlea (for hearing) and the vestibular apparatus (for balance). Vestibulocochlear Ganglion: This is a cluster of nerve cell bodies located near the inner ear. It contains sensory neurons that are responsible for hearing and balance. While the otic placodes contribute to the development of the inner ear structures, the neurons of the vestibulocochlear ganglion do not arise directly from the ectodermal placodes. Instead, the otic placodes form the otic vesicles, and neurons for the vestibulocochlear ganglion develop from the cells that bud off from these vesicles. Ectodermal Placodes: Neural crest cells migrate before neural tube closure, while neuroepithelial cells become part of the surface ectoderm, forming placodes. Placodes thicken after receiving an inductive signal, generating migratory neuronal cells for cranial sensory ganglia or forming a vesicle. Ectodermal placodes can either form nervous tissue (neurogenic) or non-neurogenic tissues like the lens vesicle. (Option A) Important Placodes Hypophysial Placode Forms Rathke’s pouch (future pituitary gland). Olfactory Placode Develops into nasal cavity epithelium. (Option B) Epibranchial Placodes Contribute to facial, glossopharyngeal, and vagus ganglia. Otic Placodes Develop into the inner ear (membranous labyrinth) structures. (Option C) Trigeminal Placodes Contribute to trigeminal ganglia. Reference: Grey’s Anatomy, 42nd Edition, Page 236",

      "explanation": "Correct Answer: B) Incomplete development of the basichondrocranium Explanation: Anencephaly is associated with severe abnormalities in the base of the skull (basichondrocranium), affecting its shape, position, and ossification. Anencephaly: Neurulation failure : Anencephaly occurs when the neural tube fuses in the spinal cord (Caudal neuropore) but fails to fuse in the brain region (Cranial neuropore), leading to missing parts of the brain and skull. The cranial and caudal neuropores close around day 25 and 28 of development respectively in a normally developing fetus. Types of Neural Tube Defects: Neural Tube Defect Description Anencephaly (Cranioschisis) Failure of neural tube fusion in the brain region, results in missing parts of the brain and skull. Craniorachischisis Totalis Complete failure of the neural tube to fuse, affecting both the brain and spinal cord.

Rachischisis and Craniorachischisis: Condition Rachischisis Craniorachischisis Description A type of spina bifida where a portion of the spinal cord remains open. The most severe form of neural tube defect- involving exposure of both the brain and spinal cord. Neural Tube Involvement Occurs due to the failure of fusion of the caudal portion of the neural tube.

      "explanation": "defect. Correct Answer: B) Meningocele involves protrusion of the meninges and spinal cord through the defect. Explanation: Meningocele involves only the protrusion of the meninges , not the spinal cord. When the spinal cord is also involved, the condition is called myelomeningocele . Spina bifida is a birth defect where the neural tube fails to close properly, affecting the caudal portion of the spinal neural tube. Types: Type Description Spina Bifida Cystica Involves a visible sac or cyst containing the spinal cord or nerves protruding from the back.Two types: Meningocele: A sac containing only the meninges and CSF, with the spinal cord intact. Myelomeningocele: Sac contains both the meninges and a portion of the spinal cord; the most severe form. Spina Bifida Occulta The defect is hidden under the skin, typically found in the lumbosacral or sacral regions; it affects ~5% of the population. Impact on Spinal Cord Development: Impact Description Ascent of the Conus Medullaris The conus medullaris normally ascends relative to the vertebral column. In spina bifida, this ascent is impaired, leading to a tethered cord. Tethered Cord The spinal cord is anchored at the defect site, restricting normal upward movement, which can cause neurological complications. Diastematomyelia An extremely rare condition where the spinal cord is split into two columns by a bony or cartilaginous spur, often associated with tethered cord. (Option C) Prenatal Diagnosis: Detection : Spina bifida can be identified through ultrasound imaging during pregnancy. Spina Bifida Occulta Indicator : The posterior ossification centres of the vertebrae may display an abnormal U or V shape. (Option A) Incidence : The prevalence of severe types, such as myelomeningocele, has decreased due to improved prenatal diagnosis and options for termination. (Option D)",
