      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: B) Trisomy 21 Explanation: Trisomy 21, commonly known as Down syndrome, results from an extra copy of chromosome 21. People with Down syndrome often have distinct facial features, intellectual disabilities, and certain medical problems. Approximately half of individuals with Down syndrome have a single transverse palmar crease, making this the correct answer. The simian crease is relatively common in Down syndrome. Down's syndrome , caused by trisomy 21, is associated with multiple systemic manifestations due to the presence of an extra copy of chromosome 21. This is due to meiotic nondisjunction in either maternal or paternal gamete. Occurs at a frequency of 1:800 to 1:1000 newborns. The overexpression of genes located on chromosome 21 contributes to the clinical features. Clinical Features and Diagnosis: General Features: Intellectual disability Flat facial profile, upward-slanting eyes with epicanthic folds, oblique palpebral fissure (visible when eyes are open). Small nose with flat nasal bridge Narrow palate, small teeth, and furrowed, protruding tongue Significant hypotonia Small, brachycephalic skull with flat occiput, and small, dysplastic ears Short, broad hands with clinodactyly (hypoplasia of the middle phalanx of the fifth finger) Simian crease on the palm A wide gap between the first and second toes (sandal gap) Comorbidities Congenital Heart Disease : 40% of children have congenital heart defects, primarily endocardial cushion defects (40-60% of cases) - AVSD, VSD, ASD, PDA, TOF. Early cardiac evaluation is crucial. Gastrointestinal Malformations : 12% have atresias, especially duodenal",

      },
      "correct_answer": "D",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: D) Fibrous joint Explanation: The middle radioulnar joint, located between the radius and ulna bones in the forearm, facilitates forearm rotation for pronation and supination. It's a fibrous joint known as a syndesmosis, characterized by dense connective tissue like ligaments or interosseous membranes holding the bones together. Fibrous joints connect bones with fibrous connective tissue, allowing minimal movement. They come in three main types: Sutures Gomphosis Syndesmosis Joints between two skull bones. Sutures are immobile in adults and slightly mobile in babies. Gomphosis is an immobile joint. Tooth-socket joints. Slightly mobile joint. Examples include the radioulnar joint and inferior tibiofibular joint. Plane synovial (Option A): Plane synovial joints, also known as gliding joints, are characterized by flat articular surfaces that allow sliding or gliding movements between bones. Primary cartilaginous (Option B): Primary cartilaginous joints, also known as synchondroses, are joints where the bones are connected by hyaline cartilage. Secondary cartilaginous (Option C): Secondary cartilaginous joints, also known as symphyses, are joints where the bones are connected by fibrocartilage.",
