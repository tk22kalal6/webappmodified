      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: A Option A: a. Pudendal nerve: The pudendal nerve is the correct option. The pudendal nerve is a nerve that arises from the sacral plexus and provides sensory and motor innervation to the perineum, including the external genitalia and the anus. The ischial spine is an important landmark in the pelvis, and the pudendal nerve passes posterior to the ischial spine during its course. Incorrect Options: Option B: Sciatic nerve: The sciatic nerve is an incorrect option. The sciatic nerve is the largest nerve in the body and arises from the sacral plexus. It runs down the posterior thigh and does not directly pass through or relate to the ischial spine. Option C: Obturator nerve: The obturator nerve is an incorrect option. The obturator nerve arises from the lumbar plexus and provides sensory and motor innervation to the medial compartment of the thigh. It does not have a direct relationship with the ischial spine. Option D: Femoral nerve: Option D is not explained in the initial question. However, the femoral nerve is an incorrect option. The femoral nerve arises from the lumbar plexus and provides sensory and motor innervation to the anterior thigh. It does not have a direct relationship with the ischial spine. Reference: .",

      "correct_answer": "D",
      "explanation": "attached to the pelvic brim. The levator ani muscles are not attached to the pelvic brim. Instead, they originate from various bony structures in the pelvis, including the pubis, ischial spine, and tendinous arch of the pelvic fascia. The muscles then converge and attach to the coccyx and the anococcygeal raphe. Incorrect options: Option A: The statement that the levator ani muscles support pelvic viscera is correct. The levator ani muscles form a muscular sling within the pelvis and provide support to the pelvic organs, including the bladder, uterus, and rectum. Option B: The statement that the levator ani muscles converge downwards and medially is correct. The muscle fibers of the levator ani muscles come together and run in a downward and medial direction towards the midline of the pelvis. Option C: The statement that the levator ani muscles consist of the iliococcygeus and pubococcygeus muscles is correct. The levator ani muscles are composed of three main parts: the pubococcygeus, iliococcygeus, and puborectalis muscles. The iliococcygeus and pubococcygeus muscles are two of the components of the levator ani muscle group. Reference: .",

The superior rectal vein, which drains blood from the rectum, is often involved in hemorrhoidal bleeding. Thus, the superior rectal vein (option B) is the correct answer. Incorrect options: Option A: Superior rectal artery: The superior rectal artery is responsible for supplying arterial blood to the rectum. However, in the context of hemorrhoids, the bleeding vessel is typically a vein rather than an artery. Therefore, the superior rectal artery (option A) is not the correct answer. Option C: Middle rectal artery: The middle rectal artery is responsible for supplying blood to the middle portion of the rectum. While it plays a role in rectal blood supply, it is not typically associated with bleeding in hemorrhoids. Therefore, the middle rectal artery (option C) is not the correct choice. Option D; Middle rectal vein: The middle rectal vein drains blood from the middle portion of the rectum. Similar to the middle rectal artery, it is not directly associated with hemorrhoidal bleeding.

      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: B) Epididymis: Explanation: The marked structures in the histological image are cilia. Cilia are slender, hair-like structures found on the surface of many epithelial cells. They play a vital role in the movement of fluids and particles along various passageways in the body. While the epithelial lining of the epididymis does have stereocilia (long microvilli), it does not typically have cilia. Surface Projections Microvilli : Small finger-like projections (~1 micrometer) that increase surface area, found in the brush border of the kidney, gall bladder, and intestinal cells. Stereocilia : Long microvilli (15-20 micrometers) located in the hair cells of the inner ear and the epididymis in the male reproductive tract. Cilia : Motile cilia (7-10 micrometers) propel substances along the surface of certain epithelia. Non-motile cilia , present on nearly every cell in the G0 stage, were once considered nonfunctional but are now known to play a role in signaling pathways during both development and adulthood. Oviduct, Bronchi, Ependyma (Options A, C, and D): have cilia in their epithelial lining. Reference: BD Chaurasiaâ€™s Human Anatomy, 8th Edtion, Page no: 345",

      },
      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: A) Gluteus medius Explanation: The gluteus medius is the primary muscle responsible for hip abduction and stabilization of the pelvis during walking . During the stance phase , when one leg is on the ground and the other is lifted, the gluteus medius of the supporting leg contracts to prevent pelvic drop on the opposite side. This mechanism is known as the Trendelenburg mechanism , and dysfunction leads to a Trendelenburg gait .

Obturator internus (Option C): Incorrect because it mainly functions as a lateral rotator of the hip , not in pelvic stabilization. Quadratus femoris (Option D): Incorrect because it is a lateral rotator of the hip , not involved in abduction or pelvic stability.

      },
      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: C) The medial portion of the thigh Explanation: In bulbar urethral injury , the spongy urethra is damaged, leading to extravasation of urine into the superficial perineal space . Urine can track into the perineum, scrotum, penis, and anterior abdominal wall due to the continuity of the Colles' fascia, Dartos fascia, and Scarpa's fascia . However, it does not spread into the thigh because Colles' fascia is firmly attached to the fascia lata of the thigh , preventing urine from tracking into the medial thigh. Urine Extravasation in Urethral Injuries Type of Urethral Injury Common Cause Urine Accumulation Areas Restricted Bulbar urethral injury (Spongy urethra rupture) Straddle injury (e.g., falling on a hard object) Perineum, scrotum, penis, anterior abdominal wall Thigh (due to attachment of Colles' fascia) Membranous urethral injury Pelvic fractures Retropubic space, perineum Scrotum and penis (if Buckâ€™s fascia remains intact) Penile urethral injury Blunt trauma or catheterization Confined within Buckâ€™s fascia if intact, or perineum if ruptured None if Buckâ€™s fascia is disrupted Perineum (Option A): incorrect because urine accumulates in the superficial perineal space due to the injury. Anterior abdominal wall (Option B): incorrect because urine can track upward via Scarpaâ€™s fascia .

      "correct_answer": "D",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: D) Internal iliac artery Explanation: In cases of severe postpartum hemorrhage (PPH) , ligation of the internal iliac artery is a common life-saving procedure. However, this artery also supplies the gluteal region via the superior and inferior gluteal arteries . Ligation can lead to ischemia and pain in the gluteal region , which explains the symptoms seen in this patient.

Superior gluteal artery (Option B): incorrect because while it supplies the gluteal muscles, it is a branch of the internal iliac artery and is not directly ligated in PPH. Inferior gluteal artery (Option C): incorrect because, though it supplies the gluteal region, it is also a branch of the internal iliac artery and is rarely ligated alone.

      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "extravasation of blood into the ischiorectal fossa because this area is located deep to the perineal membrane and is separated from the superficial perineal structures by the deep perineal fascia . Pathway of Urine Extravasation in Penile Urethral Rupture: If the spongy (penile) urethra ruptures, urine and blood extravasate into the: Superficial perineal pouch â†’ Because the Buckâ€™s fascia (deep fascia of the penis) is torn. Skin around the scrotum â†’ Due to continuity of the superficial perineal fascia (Collesâ€™ fascia) . Anterior abdominal wall â†’ Through the continuity of Scarpaâ€™s fascia (superficial fascia of the lower abdomen) with Colles' fascia.

      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "of the pelvic cavity . It is composed of the levator ani muscles and the coccygeus muscle. Iliococcygeus (Muscle A) â†’ Part of the levator ani , helps support pelvic organs. Pubococcygeus (Muscle B) â†’ Another part of the levator ani , important for continence and pelvic floor integrity. The pelvic diaphragm is a muscular sheet that forms the inferior border of the pelvic cavity. It consists of several muscles that work together to support the pelvic organs and assist in various functions. The components of the pelvic diaphragm are: Levator ani muscle complex, which includes: Pubococcygeus Iliococcygeus Coccygeus muscle or Ischiococcygeus Functions: Supports pelvic viscera (bladder, uterus, rectum). Maintains urinary and faecal continence. Innervation: Primarily by the pudendal nerve (S2-S4). Clinical significance: Weakness can lead to prolapse and incontinence. Kegel exercises can improve function. Obturator internus (Muscle C) â€“ Incorrect: This muscle is part of the lateral pelvic wall , not the pelvic diaphragm. It assists in hip rotation , not pelvic floor support. Deep transverse perinei (Muscle D) â€“ Incorrect: This muscle is part of the urogenital diaphragm , which lies inferior to the pelvic diaphragm . It supports the perineal body but does not constitute the pelvic diaphragm. Reference: Williams Gynecology, 4th edition, Page 798",

      "question": "What is the volume of the prostate in healthy adult males?",
      "options": {
        "A": "20cc",
        "B": "50cc",
        "C": "75cc",
        "D": "100cc"
      },
      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "approximately 20â€“30 cc (cubic centimeters or mL). The prostate gland grows gradually with age, and an enlarged prostate (>30 cc) is often seen in benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) . Measurement of prostate volume is commonly done using transrectal ultrasound (TRUS) or MRI. The prostate gland weighs 20 gm in a normal adult male and is made up following zones: Zone Features Peripheral This zone makes up about 70% of the prostate gland and surrounds the urethra. The majority of prostate cancers (70-80%) originate in the peripheral zone, since it is rich in glandular tissue, making it susceptible. Central It is situated at the base of the prostate gland, surrounding the ejaculatory ducts. Inflammation of the prostate gland (prostatitis) commonly affects the central zone. Transitional It is located near the urethra and accounts for about 5-10% of the prostate gland. BPH primarily affects the transitional zone, leading to urinary symptoms such as frequency, urgency, weak urine flow, and difficulty initiating or stopping urination. 50cc (option B): A prostate volume of >30 cc is usually indicative of benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) . 75cc (option C): A prostate volume of >40â€“50 cc is considered moderately enlarged , often seen in symptomatic BPH. 100cc (option D): Prostates exceeding 100 cc are considered severely enlarged , often leading to significant urinary obstruction and requiring medical or surgical intervention.

      },
      "correct_answer": "D",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: D) Anterior abdominal wall Explanation: The bulbar urethra is a part of the male urethra located just before the penile urethra. An injury to the bulbar urethra can lead to a urethral rupture, allowing urine to leak into the surrounding tissues. In the case of bulbar urethral rupture, the urine extravasates to Superficial perineal pouch Scrotum Penile region Anterior abdominal wall Extravasation of Urine: Due to rupture of spongy urethra below the perineal membrane causes urine to accumulate in â€“ superficial extravasation. If Buck's fascia is intact, extravasation of blood and urine confined to penile shaft. If Buck's fascia is disrupted: Superficial perineal pouch Scrotum Around penis Lower part of anterior abdominal wall Urine cannot escape to: Deep perineal pouch (because of perineal membrane) Ischiorectal fossa (because of Colles' fascia) Thigh (fascia lata) Due to rupture of membranous urethra above the perineal membrane causes urine to accumulate in â€“ deep extravasation. Deep perineal pouch Extraperitoneal space Space of Retzius (space around bladder and prostate) Superficial perineal space if perineal membrane also ruptured Inguinal pouch (Option A): The inguinal pouch is not a typical location for urine collection. It is an area in the groin region, and urine collection there wouldn't be directly related to a bulbar urethral injury. Peritoneal cavity (Option B): The peritoneal cavity is the abdominal cavity where various organs are located. It is not a common location for urine collection due to a bulbar urethral injury. Leakage of urine into the peritoneal cavity could result in a condition known as urinoma, but this is not the primary location of urine collection in cases of bulbar urethral injury. Ischiorectal fossa (Option C): The ischiorectal fossa is situated in the pelvic region, but it is not a usual site for urine collection due to a bulbar urethral injury. This fossa contains fat and connective tissue and is not directly connected to the urinary system. Reference: BD Chaurasiaâ€™s Human Anatomy, 8th Edtion, Page no: 324",

      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: C) Pouch of Douglas Explanation: The marked area in the image is the Pouch of Douglas. The Pouch of Douglas, also known as the rectouterine pouch, is the lowest point of the peritoneal cavity in females. It is located between the posterior aspect of the uterus and the anterior aspect of the rectum. It is a common site for the accumulation of fluids, such as in the case of peritoneal infections or blood after pelvic surgeries. Rectouterine pouch (Pouch of Douglas): Pouch between rectum posteriorly and uterus anteriorly Most dependent part of the abdominal cavity in standing Most dependent part of the abdomen in the lying down position is the hepatorenal pouch of Morrison Morrison's pouch (Option A): This is the space between the liver and the right kidney. It is not located in the pelvic area but in the upper abdomen. Vesicouterine pouch (Option B): This is located between the uterus and the bladder, higher in the pelvic cavity, and is not the same as the Pouch of Douglas. Ischioanal Fossa (Option D) is a fat-filled space situated on either side of the anus, located just below the pelvic diaphragm, essentially acting as a cushion around the anal canal; it is considered part of the anal region and is sometimes referred to as the ischiorectal fossa.
