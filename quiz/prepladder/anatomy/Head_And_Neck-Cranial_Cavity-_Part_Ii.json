At birth, this area is filled with a membrane, which typically closes by around 2 months of age , though it can sometimes be delayed until 6 months. The anterior branch of the middle meningeal artery runs beneath the Pterion and Stem of lateral sulcus . Injury to this area can result in extradural or epidural haemorrhage . The pterion is a frequent location for trephination (creating an opening in the skull) during surgical procedures. Lesser wing of sphenoid (Option A) helps separate the anterior and middle cranial fossae and serves as an attachment point for various muscles and ligaments. Maxilla (Option B) is a paired facial bone that forms the upper jaw and holds the upper teeth.

Middle Meningeal artery : It is a branch of the first part of the maxillary artery, originating in the infratemporal fossa. It enters the middle cranial fossa through the foramen spinosum and splits into frontal and parietal branches by grooving at the temporal bone.

They are strongly associated with chronic hypertension and are a common cause of intracerebral haemorrhage, often resulting from the rupture of deep-seated arteries in the brain tissue.

      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: B) Exits the skull via the jugular foramen alongside the vagus nerve. Explanation: The spinal accessory nerve exits the skull via the jugular foramen, travelling within the same dural sheath as the vagus nerve, separated by a fold of arachnoid mater. Course of the spinal accessory nerve Origin and Ascent within the Spinal Cord Arises from motor neurons in the lateral aspect of the ventral horn of the cervical spinal cord (C1/2 to C5/6). Rootlets combine to form the spinal accessory nerve trunk, ascend within the vertebral canal and enter the skull through the foramen magnum, Intracranial Course Inside the skull, the nerve turns upward and moves laterally toward the jugular foramen. Travels through the jugular foramen in the same dural sheath as the vagus nerve, separated by a fold of arachnoid mater. Extracranial Course and Branching Exits the jugular foramen. Crossed by the occipital artery as it descends obliquely, running medial to the styloid process, stylohyoid muscle, and posterior belly of the digastric. Travels with the superior sternocleidomastoid branch of the occipital artery to the upper part of the sternocleidomastoid muscle and forms an anastomosis with C2 and C3 nerve fibres. Path to the Trapezius Muscle Emerges from the sternocleidomastoid muscle. Crosses the posterior triangle of the neck, lying on top of the levator scapulae and may divide into a plexus on the deep surface of the trapezius muscle, receiving contributions from C2-C4. Innervation Sole motor supply to the sternocleidomastoid muscle Provides motor innervation to the upper and middle parts of the trapezius muscle.",

Falx cerebri (Option A) separates the left and right cerebral hemispheres and contains the superior sagittal sinus along its upper margin.

Dural Venous Sinuses: These are channels that drain blood from the brain and are located between the layers of the dura mater. They can be classified as 7 Paired & 7 Unpaired. Unpaired Sinuses: Unpaired Sinuses Superior Sagittal Sinus Located along the midline, running from the front of the skull to the back. It collects blood from the brain's superficial structures. Inferior Sagittal Sinus Runs parallel to the superior sagittal sinus but is smaller and located lower. It drains blood from the deep structures of the brain. Straight Sinus Formed by the junction of the inferior sagittal sinus and the great cerebral vein. It drains into the confluence of sinuses. Occipital Sinus Located in the posterior cranial fossa, it drains the posterior part of the brain. Anterior Intercavernous Sinus Connects the two cavernous sinuses at the front, allowing for communication between them. Posterior Intercavernous Sinus Connects the cavernous sinuses at the back, also facilitating inter-sinus communication. Basilar Venous Plexus Drains blood from the brainstem and parts of the cerebellum. Paired Sinuses: Paired Sinuses Transverse Sinus Located on either side of the brain, they drain blood from the superior sagittal sinus to the sigmoid sinuses. Sigmoid Sinus Continuations of the transverse sinuses, curve down to drain into the internal jugular veins. Superior Petrosal Sinus Located above the petrous part of the temporal bone, they drain blood from the cavernous sinus to the transverse sinuses.
