      },
      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: C) Hemispatial neglect Explanation: Hemispatial neglect is not typically associated with agenesis of the corpus callosum. Hemispatial neglect is often seen in patients with damage to one hemisphere , particularly the right hemisphere, leading to inattention to the opposite side of space (usually the left). In agenesis, both hemispheres may function independently, so hemispatial neglect is not a hallmark of this condition. Agenesis of the corpus callosum is a rare congenital condition in which the corpus callosum , the structure connecting the two cerebral hemispheres, fails to develop properly or is absent. This can lead to a range of neurological and developmental issues. Causes: Genetic : Chromosomal abnormalities (e.g., trisomy 13, 18) or mutations in specific genes. Environmental : Prenatal factors like infections, alcohol, or drug exposure. Clinical Features: Developmental delays : Intellectual disability, motor delays, and speech impairments. Seizures : Common due to lack of communication between brain hemispheres. Motor problems : Coordination issues, ataxia. Behavioral issues : Hyperactivity, impulsivity, and autistic-like behaviors. Cognitive challenges : Attention deficits and difficulty with higher cognitive functions. Associated Conditions: Aicardi syndrome, Andermann syndrome, holoprosencephaly, fetal alcohol syndrome.",

      "explanation": "Correct Answer: D) Structure D Explanation: The corpus callosum is the largest commissure of the brain. It is divided from before backwards into the following four parts: Genu: This is the thick, curved front part of the corpus callosum, located about 4 cm behind the front of the brain. Its fibers curve forward into the front parts of the frontal lobes, forming a fork-like shape known as the forceps minor . Rostrum: The genu extends downward and backward as a thin extension called the rostrum, which connects to the lamina terminalis. Body: It is the central part of the corpus callosum, situated between the front (genu) and back (splenium) parts. Splenium: The splenium is the large, back part of the corpus callosum, located about 6 cm in front of the occipital region. Its fibers connect the parietal, temporal, and occipital lobes of both brain hemispheres. The fibers connecting the occipital lobes form another fork-like shape known as the forceps major . Function: The corpus callosum is largely responsible for interhemispheric transfer of information which is essential for bilateral responses and learning processes.",

      "options": {
        "A": "Anterior cerebral artery",

      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: B) Middle cerebral artery Explanation: The middle cerebral artery supplies the lateral surface of the brain, including areas responsible for motor control of the arm, face, and language centres (Broca's and Wernicke's areas), which align with the patient's symptoms. Blood Supply to the Cerebrum: Surface Type Major Artery Supplied By Lateral Surface Middle cerebral artery (primary), anterior cerebral artery (superomedial border), posterior cerebral artery (occipital lobe, inferior temporal gyrus) Medial & Inferior Surface Anterior cerebral artery (largest area), middle cerebral artery (temporal pole, orbital surface), posterior cerebral artery (remaining areas) Important considerations: Watershed areas : Regions of the brain located at the outermost edges of the major cerebral arterial territories are known as watershed areas. These areas are the most vulnerable to insufficient blood supply during cerebral hypoperfusion. Macular sparing : When the posterior cerebral artery is occluded, Central vision may be spared due to collateral circulation from the middle cerebral artery. The anterior cerebral artery (Option A) primarily supplies the medial portions of the frontal lobes, affecting leg motor control, not the arm or face. It might also present with urinary incontinence, mutism, apathy, or euphoria. The posterior cerebral artery (Option C) supplies the occipital lobe and inferior temporal lobe, which are more associated with visual processing, not motor control or speech. The vertebral artery (Option D) supplies the brainstem and cerebellum, which would cause different symptoms like coordination issues, brainstem stroke syndromes, or vertigo.",

      },
      "correct_answer": "D",
      "explanation": "parts like hands and face. Correct Answer: D) The motor homunculus in the precentral gyrus has larger areas for fine motor parts like hands and face. Explanation: Homunculus: The homunculus maps body parts onto the cerebral cortex, illustrating how different areas of the brain correspond to specific body regions based on motor and sensory functions. Areas with more intricate sensory or motor functions occupy more space in the brain. Motor Homunculus: Location : Precentral gyrus, frontal lobe It is a map (‘motor homunculus’) of the opposite body half, where, The face is represented most laterally and inferiorly, The hand is represented in the central region Leg and foot are represented on the medial surface of the hemisphere Sensory Homunculus: Location : Postcentral gyrus, parietal lobe. (Option C) Function : Represents sensory perception, mapping body parts based on sensitivity to touch, pain, and temperature. Body parts with higher sensory acuity, like lips and fingertips, occupy larger areas. (Option B) Visual Representation: Distorted human figures where body parts are sized according to their brain representation. For instance, hands and faces are shown disproportionately large to reflect their greater cortical representation. In the motor homunculus, finer motor control areas like arms and legs have larger cortical regions (Option A): Hands and faces occupy a larger area than arms and legs in the motor homunculus.",
