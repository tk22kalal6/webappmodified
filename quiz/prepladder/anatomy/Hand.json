      "explanation": "Correct Answer: C) Ulnar nerve Explanation: Cubital Fossa: Triangular space present in front of distal humerus and elbow joint. Boundaries: Medially Lateral border of pronator teres Laterally Medial border of brachioradialis Apex Point of convergence of medial and lateral boundaries Base Imaginary line connecting the medial and lateral epicondyles of humerus. Roof Formed by deep fascia and reinforced by bicipital aponeurosis.The deep fascia is continuity of brachial and antebrachial fascia. Floor Lower portion of brachialis forms the floor of the upper part of the fossa; the supinator muscle forms the floor of the lower part of the fossa. Contents of cubital fossa: Median nerve: Lies medial to the brachial artery in the fossa and is anterior to brachioradialis and posterior to bicipital aponeurosis. Radial nerve: Enters the cubital region by passing forwards in interval between the brachialis and brachioradialis and then divides into superficial branch and deep branch (posterior interosseous nerve). Brachial artery: Centrally placed in fossa and divides into radial and ulnar arteries with immediate anterior relation is bicipital aponeurosis.

      "question": "Which of the following is a unique feature of the clavicle compared to other bones in the body?",
      "options": {
        "A": "It ossifies from both membranous and cartilaginous origins.",
        "B": "It articulates directly with the scapula without an intervening joint cavity.",
        "C": "It is the only bone in the body that does not have a medullary cavity.",
        "D": "It is entirely covered by the periosteum, unlike other bones."
      },
      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: A) It ossifies from both membranous and cartilaginous origins Explanation: The clavicle is unique among bones in the human body due to its dual ossification process: Intramembranous Ossification : The medial and lateral parts of the clavicle develop through intramembranous ossification. This process is typical for flat bones like the skull. Endochondral Ossification : The sternal end of the clavicle ossifies through endochondral ossification, which involves a cartilage template being replaced by bone. This process is more common for long bones like the femur and humerus. Features of the Clavicle: Horizontally placed long bone (unique among long bones). Two primary centers of ossification develop during intrauterine life to form the shaft (most long bones have only one primary center). One secondary ossification center Subcutaneous throughout and easily palpable. Lacks a medullary cavity , unlike most long bones. Parts of the Clavicle: Medial 2/3 : Anterior convexity. Lateral 1/3 : Anterior concavity. Junction of these segments is prone to fractures. Muscle Attachments: Medial 2/3 (Anterior) : Origin of Pectoralis Major . Lateral 1/3 (Anterior) : Origin of Deltoid . Lateral 1/3 (Posterior) : Insertion of Trapezius . The clavicle articulates with the scapula at the acromioclavicular joint , which does have a joint cavity. (Option B) While it is true that the clavicle lacks a medullary cavity, it is not the only bone with this feature (Flat bones like the sternum and skull bones). (Option C) All bones in the body are covered by periosteum except at articular surfaces. This characteristic is not unique to the clavicle.

        "D": "The carrying angle increases as the arm moves from full flexion to extension."
      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: B) The carrying angle disappears during full flexion and pronation of the forearm. arm is fully extended. This angle, typically 13° , is due to the medially and downwardly directed transverse axis of the elbow joint. The factors that contribute to this angle include: Medial flange of the trochlea being 6 mm deeper than the lateral flange. Oblique placement of the superior articular surface of the coronoid process of the ulna. The carrying angle disappears during full flexion and pronation of the forearm, with the forearm aligning with the arm in the mid-prone position. This allows better precision in hand control. The angle is typically 10°–15° in males and greater than 15° in females Cubitus valgus is characterized by an increased carrying angle, causing the forearm to deviate outward , while cubitus varus involves a decreased carrying angle, causing the forearm to angle inward.

      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: C) Coracoid process Explanation: The infraclavicular fossa , also known as the deltopectoral triangle , is a triangular depression located below the junction of the lateral and middle thirds of the clavicle. It is defined by the following boundaries: Medially : The pectoralis major muscle. Laterally : The anterior fibers of the deltoid muscle. Superiorly : The clavicle . The tip of the coracoid process of the scapula lies approximately 2–3 cm below the clavicle and is overlapped by the anterior fibers of the deltoid. It can be felt during deep palpation just lateral to the infraclavicular fossa , which helps in locating important structures like the brachial plexus and subclavian artery in clinical assessments. This area is clinically significant for procedures such as brachial plexus block and the assessment of vascular structures like the subclavian artery .

      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: B) Flexor digitorum profundus Explanation: The flexor digitorum profundus (FDP) is responsible for flexing the distal interphalangeal (DIP) joints of the 2nd to 5th fingers. The muscles of the anterior compartment of forearm are the flexor-pronator muscles and arranged in 3 layers: Superficial layer: Pronator teres Flexor carpi radialis Flexor carpi ulnaris Palmaris longus Intermediate layer: Flexor digitorum superficialis Deep layer: 1. Flexor digitorum profundus: Origin Proximal three-quarters of the anterior and medial surfaces of the ulna and the interosseous membrane. Insertion Bases of the distal phalanges of the 2nd to 5th digits. Action Flexes the distal interphalangeal (DIP) joints of the 2nd to 5th fingers and flexion of wrist. Nerve Supply Medial part by ulnar nerve and lateral part by median nerve (C8, T1) 2. Flexor Pollicis Longus: Origin Anterior surface of the radius and adjacent interosseous membrane. Insertion Base of the distal phalanx of the thumb. Action Flexion of phalanges of thumb Nerve Supply Median nerve (anterior interosseous branch) (C8, T1). 3. Pronator Quadratus: Origin Distal one-quarter of the anterior surface of the ulna. Insertion Distal one-quarter of the anterior surface of the radius. Action Pronation of the forearm (pulls the radius over the ulna). Nerve Supply Median nerve (anterior interosseous branch) (C8, T1).

      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: A) Flexor pollicis longus Explanation: Flexor pollicis longus is a deep muscle of the anterior compartment of forearm which helps in flexion of distal phalanges of the thumb and no action in flexion of wrist. The muscles of the anterior compartment of forearm are the flexor-pronator muscles and arranged in 3 layers: Superficial layer: Pronator teres Flexor carpi radialis Flexor carpi ulnaris Palmaris longus Intermediate layer: Flexor digitorum superficialis Deep layer: Flexor digitorum profundus Flexor pollicis longus Pronator quadratus Superficial muscles of anterior compartment of forearm consists of 5 muscles: 1. Pronator teres: Origin Humeral head- Medial epicondyle of the humerus (via the common flexor tendon) Ulnar head - Coronoid process of the ulna Insertion Lateral surface of the midshaft of the radius. Action Pronates the forearm and weak flexor of elbow. Nerve Supply Median nerve (C6, C7). 2. Flexor Carpi Radialis (FCR): Origin Medial epicondyle of the humerus (via the common flexor tendon). Insertion Base of the second and third metacarpal bones. Action Flexes and abducts the wrist (radial deviation). Nerve Supply Median nerve (C6, C7). 3. Palmaris Longus: Origin Medial epicondyle of the humerus (via the common flexor tendon). Insertion Flexor retinaculum and palmar aponeurosis. Action Flexion of hand at wrist makes palmar aponeurosis tense. Nerve Supply Median nerve (C7, C8). 4. Flexor Carpi Ulnaris: Origin Humeral head- Medial epicondyle of the humerus (via the common flexor tendon) Ulnar head- Olecranon and posterior border of the ulna. Insertion Pisiform, hook of hamate, and base of the fifth metacarpal. Action Flexes and adducts the wrist Nerve Supply Ulnar nerve (C7, C8). 5. Flexor Digitorum Superficialis: Origin Humeroulnar head- Medial epicondyle of the humerus and coronoid process of the ulna Radial head- Oblique line of the radius Insertion Middle phalanges of the 2nd to 5th digits. Action Flexion of middle and proximal phalanges of digits. Nerve Supply Median nerve (C7, C8, T1)",
