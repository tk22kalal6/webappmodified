      },
      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: C) Tonsils are covered by stratified squamous epithelium that forms deep crypts. Mucosa Associated Lymphoid Tissue (MALT) Tonsils Includes diffuse lymphoid cells and organized aggregates (e.g., tonsils, Peyer’s patches). (Option D) The aggregations consist of lymphatic follicles (nodules) resembling lymph node structure, with possible germinal centers . Between the nodules, diffuse lymphoid tissue, known as the parafollicular zone , is present. Parts: GALT: Found in the gastrointestinal tract (e.g., Peyer’s patches). (Option A) BALT: Present in the bronchial tree. Waldeyer Ring: Lymphoid tissue in the oropharynx. Consists of T & B cells, Plasma cells and mast cells. Antibody Production: IgA: MALT produces IgA, which is the main antibody in mucosal areas, protects mucosal surfaces. (Option B) IgG & IgM: Present in lamina propria. IgE: Involved in allergic reactions. Function: Epithelium samples luminal antigens. The palatine tonsils are part of Waldeyer's ring, along with the lingual, pharyngeal, and tubal tonsils. They are covered by stratified squamous epithelium , which forms deep tonsillar crypts. (Option C) Beneath the tonsil is a collagenous hemicapsule separating it from muscle. The tonsillar tissue contains lymphoid follicles with germinal centers, similar to lymph nodes. Bacteria and particles entering the crypts are passed to follicles, triggering immune responses. Efferent lymphatics drain to deep cervical lymph nodes. In the tubal tonsils, respiratory epithelium covers the surface instead of squamous epithelium.

      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "capillaries. Correct Answer: B) The red pulp parenchyma is supported by reticular fibers and contains sheathed capillaries. Explanation: Red pulp is supported by reticular fibers, and it contains capillaries that terminate as sheathed capillaries. Spleen The capsule is composed of collagen fibers. Trabeculae function as partitions. Red pulp occupies most of the area. Red pulp contains a higher number of RBCs and also WBCs. Red pulp features splenic sinusoids surrounded by splenic cords. The red pulp parenchyma is made up of loose tissue supported by reticular fibers, interspersed with capillaries, which end as sheathed capillaries. (Option B) The perilymphoid (Perifollicular) zone of red pulp, surrounding the white pulp, lacks sinuses, has a sparse reticulin meshwork, and contains red and white blood cells in proportions similar to those in blood. (Option D) White pulp constitutes 5% - 20% of the total spleen mass. (Option A) White pulp contains both T and B cells. T cells form an eccentric cylindrical sheath around a central artery, mainly containing T helper cells, like PALS. (Option C) B cells form follicles at the edge of the PALS, often showing germinal centers in younger individuals. Splenic cords contain lymphoid macrophages, lymphocytes, and plasma cells (LMP cells). Reference: Wheater Functional Histology, 6th Edition, Page 217-223.",

      },
      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: A) Thymocytes Explanation: Thymocytes are primarily located in the cortex of the thymus and are not present in the medulla. Parts of the Thymus: Cortex : The outer, more densely packed region of the thymus. Filled with immature T cells (thymocytes) , undergoing differentiation and maturation as they move towards the medulla. The cortex contains thymic nurse cells that support the maturing thymocytes. T cells express surface markers (like TCR, CD3, CD4, and CD8) during maturation. Macrophages are present to phagocytose apoptotic T cells, which fail to mature properly. Medulla : The inner, less densely populated region. Dominated by epithelial cells with pale-staining nuclei and large cytoplasm. (Option B) Contains Hassall's corpuscles , concentric structures made of keratinized epithelial cells, involved in T cell regulation. (Option C) Dendritic cells and macrophages in the medulla present self-antigens to maturing T cells, ensuring the elimination of self-reactive cells to prevent autoimmunity. (Option D) Histology of the Thymus: Epithelial Framework : Throughout the thymus, epithelial cells provide a structural scaffold for lymphocyte development and produce hormones like thymopoietin, which regulate T cell maturation and proliferation. It is divided into lobules by connective tissue septa. A protective blood-thymus barrier prevents antigens from entering, safeguarding T cell maturation. With age, the thymus undergoes involution , where lymphoid tissue is replaced by fat, but it continues to produce mature T cells.",

The GI tract has four main layers: mucosa, submucosa, muscularis propria, and adventitia (serosa in peritoneal cavity). Mucosa consists of: Epithelium Lamina propria Muscularis mucosae (smooth muscle for local movements). Submucosa is a layer of loose connective tissue with blood vessels, lymphatics, and nerves. Muscularis propria has smooth muscle arranged in: Inner circular layer Outer longitudinal layer Only stomach has an additional oblique layer. Adventitia/Serosa is an outer layer of loose tissue, containing major vessels, nerves, and fat. The serosa is the visceral peritoneum present on the entire GIT except esophagus. Adventitia is present over the esophagus. The enteric nervous system controls gut function with the Meissner (submucosal) plexus and Auerbach (myenteric) plexus. Meissner's Plexus (Submucosal Plexus): Located in the submucosa. Contains parasympathetic ganglion cells and postganglionic sympathetic fibres. Regulates mucosal glands and the smooth muscle of the muscularis mucosae. Auerbach's Plexus (Myenteric Plexus): Found between the circular and longitudinal muscle layers of the muscularis propria.

      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: B) Columnar epithelium with intestinal metaplasia Explanation: This is the hallmark of Barrett's esophagus, indicating a transformation from squamous to columnar epithelium due to chronic irritation. Barrett's esophagus occurs when chronic reflux esophagitis causes the stratified squamous epithelium of the lower esophagus to be replaced by columnar epithelium . Intestinal metaplasia is present, with columnar epithelium containing goblet cells at the lower esophagus. The Z-line (where squamous transitions to columnar epithelium) is normally at the gastroesophageal junction but may shift up to 5 cm proximally , increasing the risk of esophageal cancer . Parietal cells may be found in stomach biopsies, but goblet cells are not present in the stomach. Fig: Histology picture of Barrett’s esophagus Squamous cell hyperplasia (Option A): This is typically not a feature of Barrett's esophagus; rather, it refers to an increase in the number of squamous cells, which occurs in response to irritation. Columnar epithelium with gastric metaplasia (Option C): Barrett’s esophagus specifically involves intestinal metaplasia, not gastric metaplasia. Intestinal metaplasia is defined by the presence of goblet cells. Glandular adenomatous hyperplasia (Option D): While Barrett's esophagus can predispose to dysplasia and adenocarcinoma, the primary change is intestinal metaplasia, not hyperplasia of glandular structures.",

      "explanation": "cells that can stretch and change shape. Correct Answer: C) It is found in the urinary bladder and ureters, consisting of multiple layers of cells that can stretch and change shape. Explanation: Transitional epithelium is found in the renal pelvis and calyces, the ureter, the urinary bladder, and prostatic urethra. Because of this distribution, it is also called urothelium. This is a multilayered epithelium with four to six thick cells that can contract and expand as needed (stretchable epithelium). Features of transitional epithelium: Cells towards the lumen are very large and called umbrella-shaped cells (typical for transitional epithelium). Each cell is attached to the basement membrane by a cytoplasmic extension. The basement membrane is straight. It is exclusively located in the urinary system and is named as urothelium. It is called transitional because it is transitional between stratified squamous and stratified columnar epithelia. It differs from stratified squamous epithelium in that the cells at the surface are not squamous. The deepest cells are columnar or cuboidal. The middle layers are made up of polyhedral or pear-shaped cells. The superficial cell layer, which lines the lumen, is the only fully differentiated layer of the epithelium. It provides an impenetrable barrier between the lumen and the bloodstream. The epithelium most specialized for absorption and secretion would be simple columnar epithelium (Option A) , which lines organs involved in these processes, such as the intestines and glands. Transitional epithelium is not found in the skin; the skin is lined by stratified squamous epithelium (Option B). The digestive tract (Option D) is lined by different types of epithelium depending on the region. Transitional epithelium is not found in the digestive tract; it is found in the urinary system .",

      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: A) Esophagus Explanation: The esophagus is lined with nonkeratinized stratified squamous epithelium and contains mucous glands (esophageal glands proper) in its submucosa for lubrication. Its muscular layer transitions from skeletal muscle (upper third) to smooth muscle (lower third), characteristic of the process of swallowing. Structure Description Esophagus Has four layers: mucosa, submucosa, muscularis externa, and adventitia. Lumen lined with nonkeratinized stratified squamous epithelium. Submucosa - compound tubuloalveolar mucous glands, known as esophageal glands proper, which aid in lubrication. The upper third of the esophagus has predominantly skeletal muscle due to voluntary control during swallowing. In the middle third, there is a gradual transition to smooth muscle, and the lower third consists entirely of smooth muscle. Lacks a serous covering, except for a short section near its lower end. Stomach (Option B ruled out) The epithelium-forming glands are supported by Lamina Propria, a connective tissue. It has a peritoneum called serosa, which is missing from the oesophagus. Lined by Simple columnar epithelium and forms some gastric glands Mucosa contains gastric pits or gastric foveolae. The gastric glands contain: Surface mucous cells- Bicarbonate ions Mucous neck cells - mucus Parietal (Oxyntic) cells- HCL & Intrinsic Factor. Chief, peptic or zymogenic cells- Pepsin Neuroendocrine cells- Serotonin & Gastrin hormone. Small Intestine (Option C & D ruled out) Small intestine has columnar epithelium, which has villi, and microvilli leading to formation of brush border epithelium. The intestinal villi are lined by a simple columnar epithelium which is continuous with the crypts. Plicae circulares (Valves of Kerckring) are circular folds given by the mucosa and submucosa. Microvilli are finger-like projections to increase the surface area for absorption. Lymphoid clusters called Peyer’s patches are characteristically found in the lamina propria of the small intestine. Cells in the mucosa are: Enterocytes Paneth cells- defence Goblet cells- Mucin Neuroendocrine cells- hormones",
