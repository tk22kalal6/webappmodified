      "explanation": "Correct Answer: B) Retinal pigment epithelium Explanation: Neural crest cells (NCCs) give rise to a wide variety of structures, including components of the peripheral nervous system, connective tissue, and pigment cells . The retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) , however, arises from the neural ectoderm , not from neural crest cells. The RPE is derived from the outer layer of the optic cup , which forms from the neural tube. Derivatives of Neural Crest Cells Structure Neural Crest Origin Ciliary muscles Derived from neural crest Ciliary ganglion Derived from neural crest Melanocytes Derived from neural crest Retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) Derived from neural ectoderm Ciliary muscles (Option A): incorrect because they arise from neural crest cells , forming part of the intraocular muscles. Ciliary ganglion (Option C): incorrect because it is a parasympathetic ganglion derived from neural crest cells. Melanocytes (Option D): incorrect because melanocytes originate from neural crest cells , contributing to pigmentation in various tissues. Reference: Grey’s Anatomy, 42nd edition. Page 236",

      "explanation": "neural tube fails to close, resulting in the absence of a major portion of the brain, skull, and scalp. Sadly, it's not compatible with life. Incorrect Options: Option A - Craniorachischisis: This occurs when both the cranial and caudal ends of the neural tube fail to close. It's a severe form of neural tube defect where the brain and spinal cord are exposed. Option B - Spina Bifida: This typically results from the incomplete closure of the caudal neuropore. It's a defect in the development of the spinal cord, but in this scenario, the rostral end is affected. Option D - Hydranencephaly: This is a condition where the cerebral hemispheres are largely or completely absent, replaced by cerebrospinal fluid. It's not specifically associated with the failure of the rostral neuropore closure.",

      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: B) Adult ovary Explanation: Meiosis occurs in the adult ovary as part of oogenesis. In females, during fetal development, primary oocytes are arrested in prophase I of meiosis. These oocytes remain in this arrested state until puberty, when they resume meiosis. Meiosis continues during ovulation, leading to the formation of a secondary oocyte, which is arrested in metaphase II until fertilization. Incorrect Options: Adrenal (option A): This is incorrect because meiosis does not occur in the adrenal glands. The adrenal glands are involved in hormone production, not gametogenesis. Prepubertal testis (option C): This is incorrect because meiosis in males begins at puberty, not before. In the prepubertal testis, germ cells undergo mitosis, not meiosis. Hypothalamus (option D): This is incorrect because the hypothalamus is part of the brain that regulates various physiological processes, including hormone release. It does not participate in meiosis.",

      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: B) Antral follicle Explanation: Antral follicles are characterized by the presence of a fluid-filled cavity (antrum) surrounding the oocyte. These follicles have multiple layers of granulosa cells , a well-developed theca interna and theca externa , and contribute to hormone production . The presence of the antrum differentiates them from primary follicles , which lack this cavity. Development of Ovarian Follicles Stage Characteristics Primordial follicle Oocytes surrounded by a single layer of flattened granulosa cells . Dormant until puberty. Primary follicle Granulosa cells become cuboidal , zona pellucida begins forming around the oocyte. No antrum. Secondary follicle Multiple layers of granulosa cells and theca cells form. Early follicular development but no antrum yet. Antral follicle Fluid-filled antrum appears , granulosa and theca cells differentiate. Prepares for ovulation. Graafian follicle Fully matured, large antrum , ready for ovulation. Corpus luteum Formed after ovulation, secretes progesterone to support pregnancy. If there is no fertilization, it degenerates. Primary follicle (Option A): Incorrect because primary follicles lack an antrum and have a single or multilayered granulosa cell arrangement. Primordial follicle (Option C): Incorrect because primordial follicles are the earliest stage, with a single layer of flattened granulosa cells and no antrum. Corpus luteum (Option D): Incorrect because the corpus luteum is a post-ovulatory structure that does not resemble a developing follicle and lacks an antrum.

The derivatives of neural crest cells include: Odontoblasts: Neural crest cells contribute to the development of odontoblasts , which are responsible for the formation of dentin in teeth. Sympathetic chain: Neural crest cells give rise to the sympathetic ganglia and the sympathetic chain , which is part of the autonomic nervous system. Melanocytes: Neural crest cells also give rise to melanocytes , which are the pigment-producing cells in the skin. Conotruncal septum: Neural crest cells contribute to the formation of the conotruncal septum , which is important in the proper separation of the pulmonary trunk and aorta during heart development. Nephrogenic cord (4): The nephrogenic cord is derived from the mesoderm , not the neural crest cells. It forms the precursors to the kidneys . Bulbus cordis (5): The bulbus cordis is part of the heart and is derived from the mesoderm . It contributes to the formation of the right ventricle and the outflow tract of the heart.

        "D": "Prechordal plate anomaly"
      },
      "correct_answer": "D",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: D) Prechordal plate anomaly Explanation: Sacrococcygeal teratomas are tumors that originate from primordial germ cells and are typically found at the base of the spine. They are associated with the remnants of the primitive streak rather than the prechordal plate. Teratomas mostly occur during the neonatal period and most of them are benign Most common site- Sacrococcygeal region Females > males The risk of malignancy increases with age It is thought to be derivative of the primitive streak Clinical features: External presacral mass with minimal intrapelvic presacral component Symptoms include weakness, paralysis, and bladder or bowel dysfunction Currarino Triad: Anorectal malformations + sacrococcygeal osseous defect + presacral mass Diagnosis: Clinical diagnosis CT/MRI is done to detect intra-abdominal and intra-pelvic components. Treatment: Complete surgical excision of the tumor should be done To avoid local recurrence - resection of the coccyx is done Benign tumor of coccyx (Option A): Sacrococcygeal teratoma is a tumor that arises at the base of the spine, often from remnants of primitive tissue, and it can exhibit both benign(mostly) and malignant (few) characteristics. Presence of teeth and hair (Option B): Teratomas can have any of the 3 germ layers (Endoderm, ectoderm or mesoderm) because primordial germ cells themselves are pluripotent cells. Result from the aberrant migration of primordial germ cell (Option C): Abrupt migration of primordial germ cells may cause oropharyngeal teratoma and sacrococcygeal teratoma.",

      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: A) Y chromosome short arm Explanation: The SRY gene (Sex-determining Region Y) is located on the short arm (p arm) of the Y chromosome, specifically at Yp11.2. It plays a critical role in initiating male sex determination by triggering the development of testes. Sex differentiation Male Development: SRY Gene: Located on the Y chromosome ; initiates the development of testes. Activates downstream genes like SOX9 and SF1 , which are essential for Sertoli and Leydig cell differentiation. Testosterone Effects: Testosterone, secreted by Leydig cells, stimulates the mesonephric (Wolffian) ducts to form male reproductive structures (e.g., epididymis, vas deferens, and seminal vesicles, and ejaculatory duct). Dihydrotestosterone (DHT): Promotes the development of external genitalia (penis and scrotum). Müllerian Inhibiting Substance (MIS): Known as Anti-Müllerian Hormone (AMH) Secreted by Sertoli cells; causes the regression of the paramesonephric (Müllerian) ducts , preventing the development of female reproductive structures. Female Development: Absence of SRY Gene: Without the SRY gene, the gonads develop into ovaries . Paramesonephric (Müllerian) Ducts: Develop into the fallopian tubes, uterus, and upper 1/3rd of the vagina . External Genitalia: Develop in the absence of testosterone, forming the clitoris, labia minora, and labia majora .

Undescended testis (Option B): Undescended testis (cryptorchidism) is usually due to issues with testicular descent, not a lack of the SRY gene. Hydrocele testis (Option C): Hydrocele is a condition where there is fluid accumulation around the testis, which is unrelated to the SRY gene. None of the above (Option D): This is incorrect because the absence or mutation of the SRY gene does lead to agenesis of testis, as mentioned above.

It acts as the site of cell migration , leading to the formation of the three germ layers (ectoderm, mesoderm, and endoderm). Primitive Streak and Its Role in Gastrulation Stage Description Formation Appears on day 15 of development as a linear thickening in the epiblast of the bilaminar disc. Function Acts as a site for epiblast cell migration , which forms the mesoderm and endoderm. Regression By the end of the 4th week , the primitive streak regresses, leaving behind the notochord and mesoderm. Clinical Significance If it fails to regress , it may lead to sacrococcygeal teratoma (tumor with all three germ layers). Notochord (Option B): Incorrect because the notochord forms after the primitive streak from mesodermal cells. Neural Groove (Option C): Incorrect because the neural groove forms later during neurulation , as the neural plate invaginates. Secondary Neural Plate (Option D): Incorrect because it is involved in secondary neurulation (formation of the caudal neural tube), not in early gastrulation.",

      },
      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: A) Endoderm Explanation: During gastrulation , epiblast cells migrate through the primitive streak to form the three germ layers. The first cells to migrate displace the hypoblast and form the endoderm . Subsequent migration leads to mesoderm formation, while non-migrating epiblast cells remain as ectoderm. Gastrulation and Germ Layer Formation Stage Description Primitive Streak Formation Forms along the midline of the epiblast, marking the site of cell migration. Endoderm Formation The first wave of migrating epiblast cells replaces the hypoblast to form the definitive endoderm , which later gives rise to the gut and associated organs. Mesoderm Formation Subsequent migration of epiblast cells forms the mesoderm, which differentiates into structures like the cardiac mesoderm and notochord. Ectoderm Formation Epiblast cells that do not migrate remain as ectoderm, which later forms the epidermis and neural structures. Cardiac mesoderm (Option B): Incorrect because it arises from the mesoderm, which forms after the endoderm. Epidermis (Option C): Incorrect as it originates from ectoderm, which forms last. Neural groove (Option D): Incorrect since it arises from the ectoderm later during neurulation, after gastrulation. Reference: Langman Medical Embryology, 14th edition, Pages 59, 60",
