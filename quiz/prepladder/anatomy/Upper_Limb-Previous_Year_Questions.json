      "question": "Based on the clinical image below, what is the most probable nerve to be injured?",
      "options": {
        "A": "Thoracodorsal nerve",
        "B": "Axillary nerve",
        "C": "Intercostal nerve",
        "D": "Long thoracic nerve"
      },
      "correct_answer": "D",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: D) Long thoracic nerve Explanation: Injury to the long thoracic nerve results in weakness of the serratus anterior and winging of the scapula, as seen in the image. The long thoracic nerve, from the upper part of the brachial plexus's superior trunk, usually receives contributions from cervical nerves C5, C6, and C7. It innervates the serratus anterior muscle, weakness of which often causes scapular winging due to inadequate protraction countered by rhomboid and trapezius actions, leading to medial scapular winging. Long thoracic nerve Origin C5 - C7 Insertion Serratus anterior muscle , which is responsible for scapular protraction and upward rotation . Nerve actions (Motor function) Protracts the scapula (pulls it forward around the thorax). Assists in arm anteversion (moving the arm forward). Lifts the ribs , aiding in respiration. Responsible for the anterolateral motion of the scapula , which is necessary for arm elevation . Incorrect Options: Thoracodorsal nerve (Option A): mainly from C7 with contributions from C6 to C8, innervates the Latissimus dorsi muscle. It's often utilized as a nerve graft in surgeries. Axillary nerve (Option B): arising from the brachial plexus's posterior cord, controls the teres minor, deltoid muscles, shoulder skin, and glenohumeral joint, often injured in orthopedic surgeries, shoulder dislocations, and rotator cuff tears. Intercostal nerve (Option C): from T1 to T11 spinal nerves, provides sensory innervation to the chest wall and abdomen skin and motor innervation to intercostal and abdominalmuscles. Reference: B. D.

      "correct_answer": "D",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: D) Axillary nerve Explanation: The axillary nerve (C5-C6) is vulnerable to injury during intramuscular injections in the deltoid muscle , especially if injected too low or too deep . Injury results in: Flattening of the shoulder (loss of deltoid muscle bulk). Loss of shoulder contour (due to deltoid atrophy). Weakness in abduction beyond 15° (deltoid function loss). Sensory loss over the lateral shoulder (regimental badge area). Prevention: Intramuscular injections should be given in the upper lateral quadrant of the deltoid to avoid axillary nerve injury . Axillary Nerve Injury Aspect Details Origin Arises from the posterior cord of the brachial plexus (C5-C6). Course Passes through quadrangular space with the posterior circumflex humeral artery . Motor Supply Deltoid muscle (shoulder abduction) and teres minor (external rotation). Sensory Supply Skin over the lateral shoulder (regimental badge area) via the superior lateral cutaneous nerve of the arm .

        "A": "Median nerve",
        "B": "Radial nerve",
        "C": "Musculocutaneous nerve",
        "D": "Ulnar nerve"
      },
      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "cord of the brachial plexus and primarily supplies the flexor muscles of the arm . Key functions affected in this injury: Elbow flexion → Impaired due to paralysis of biceps brachii, brachialis, and coracobrachialis . Forearm supination → Weakened because biceps brachii is affected (but supination is not completely lost as the supinator muscle is intact). Sensory loss → Over the lateral aspect of the forearm due to involvement of the lateral cutaneous nerve of the forearm , which is a branch of the musculocutaneous nerve. Coracobrachialis: Origin: Medial coracoid process ; Insertion: Medial aspect of middle humerus Nerve supply: Musculocutaneous nerve (C5-C7) Action: Flexion (+adduction) of arm at shoulder joint May not be paralyzed in Erb’s palsy, as in case of Erb’s palsy: C5,C6 are compromised but C7 remains unaffected and hence Coracobrachialis is not paralyzed . Muscles of arm: Muscle Attachments Nerve supply Action Biceps brachii Origin: Short head- Coracoid process ; Long head- Supragelnoid tubercle Insertion: Radial tuberosity Musculocutaneous nerve (C5-C6) Flexion and supination of forearm Brachialis Origin: anterior humerus Insertion: coronoid process & ulnar tuberosity Motor: Musculocutaneous nerve Proprioceptive: Radial nerve Flexion of forearm Coraco- brachialis Origin: medial coracoid process Insertion: medial aspect of middle humerus Musculocutaneous nerve (C5-C7) Flexion of arm Median nerve (option A): Motor: Controls most forearm flexors and thenar muscles , but does not significantly affect elbow flexion or supination . Sensory: Supplies the lateral palm and first three fingers , not the lateral forearm . Radial nerve (option B): Motor: Affects wrist extension (wrist drop) and elbow extension , but not elbow flexion .

      "explanation": "responsible for flexion at the proximal interphalangeal (PIP) and distal interphalangeal (DIP) joints, as well as extension at the metacarpophalangeal (MCP) joint. Dysfunction of these muscles, such as in ulnar nerve damage , leads to the characteristic posture of MCP extension and IP flexion , known as \"claw hand.\" Extensor digitorum (option A): This is incorrect because the extensor digitorum is primarily responsible for extending the MCP, PIP, and DIP joints. It does not cause the flexion of the IP joints with extension at the MCP joint. Abductor pollicis longus (option C): This is incorrect because the abductor pollicis longus is involved in the abduction and extension of the thumb , not the flexion or extension of the fingers. Abductor pollicis brevis (option D): This is incorrect because the abductor pollicis brevis is responsible for the abduction of the thumb and does not influence the MCP or IP joints of the fingers.

      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer A- Capitulum Explanation: The capitulum is a rounded knob-like structure located on the distal end of the humerus bone. It articulates with the radius bone to form the radiocapitular joint, which allows for flexion and extension movements of the forearm at the elbow joint. Incorrect Options: Trochlea (Option B): The trochlea is a spool-shaped structure located on the distal end of the humerus bone, just medial to the capitulum. It forms the trochlear notch of the ulna bone, creating the ulnohumeral joint. The trochlea is responsible for the hinge-like movements of the elbow Joint, allowing flexion and extension of the forearm. Olecranon (Option C): The olecranon is a bony prominence located at the proximal end of the ulna bone, forming the bony tip of the elbow. It serves as an attachment point for muscles and ligaments, including the triceps brachii muscle and the triceps tendon. The olecranon helps stabilize the elbow joint and provides leverage for extension movements of the forearm. Head of radius (Option D): The head of the radius is the rounded, disc-shaped structure located at the proximal end of the radius bone. It articulates with the capitulum of the humerus, forming the radiocapitular joint. The head of the radius allows for rotation movements of the forearm, such as pronation and supination.",

The Ulnar nerve is posterior to the medial epicondyle within the cubital tunnel. The main symptom of medial epicondylitis is the 5 to 10 mm distal tenderness to the medial epicondyle. The pain is generally aggravated with resisted wrist flexion and pronation, known as reverse Cozen's test. Hand and Forearm Deformities: Mallet Finger (Baseball Finger): Permanent flexion of the distal phalanx due to lateral band avulsion of the extensor tendon. Boutonniere Deformity: Flexion of the middle phalanx and hyperextension of the distal phalanx due to central band avulsion of the extensor tendon. Tennis Elbow (Lateral Epicondylitis): Inflammation of extensor tendons from the lateral epicondyle (common in tennis players, violinists). Golfer’s Elbow (Medial Epicondylitis): Inflammation of flexor tendons from the medial epicondyle . Volkmann Ischemic Contracture: Flexion deformity of fingers due to ischemic necrosis of forearm flexor muscles (e.g., tight cast injury). Dupuytren Contracture: Progressive thickening of the palmar aponeurosis , pulling fingers into flexion. Swan Neck Deformity: Hyperextension of the PIP joint with flexion of the DIP joint .

      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: A) Scaphoid Explanation: The anatomical snuff box is a triangular depression located on the radial aspect of the dorsum (back) of the hand. It is formed by the tendons of the extensor pollicis longus and extensor pollicis brevis muscles. Fractures within the anatomical snuff box are commonly associated with falls onto an outstretched hand, particularly with the wrist extended. The most fractured bone in this region is the scaphoid bone, also known as the navicular bone. Anatomical snuff box/Radial fossa: Triangular hollow visible on the lateral aspect of the wrist when the thumb is fully extended. Boundaries: Anterolateral: Extensor pollicis brevis, Abductor pollicis longus Posteromedial: Extensor pollicis longus Roof: Dorsal cutaneous branch of radial nerve: Found in the skin and subcutaneous tissue of anatomical snuff box. Cephalic vein: Arises from dorsal venous network of hand and crosses anatomical snuff box to travel to the anterolateral aspect of forearm. Contents Radial Artery: Crosses the floor of the anatomical snuff box. Tenderness in the anatomical snuff box following a fall on an outstretched hand strongly suggests a scaphoid fracture, as the scaphoid bone lies in the floor of the anatomical snuff box. This type of fracture is common and can have complications due to poor blood supply. Lunar (lunate) bone (Option B): The lunate bone, found in the wrist joint, rarely fractures in injuries to the anatomical snuff box and isn't usually part of its formation. Cuboid bone (Option C): The cuboid bone is one of the tarsal bones located in the foot. It is not related to the anatomical snuff box or the wrist region. Trapezius (Option D): The trapezius is a large muscle located in the upper back and neck area. It is not a bone and is not related to the anatomical snuff box or wrist injuries.",

      "explanation": "Correct Answer: A) Loss of extension of digits Explanation: The posterior interosseous nerve (PIN) is a branch of the radial nerve , arising from the deep branch after passing through the supinator muscle . It supplies the extensor muscles of the forearm except for the brachioradialis, extensor carpi radialis longus, and anconeus. Injury to the PIN leads to inability to extend the fingers (digits) at the MCP joints while wrist extension is relatively preserved (due to intact ECRL). Sensory function is not affected as the PIN is purely motor. Posterior Interosseous Nerve Palsy Feature Description Origin Deep branch of radial nerve (after supinator) Motor Supply Extensor digitorum, extensor pollicis longus & brevis, extensor indicis, ECU Sensory Supply None (purely motor) Clinical Features Weak finger extension, wrist extension intact (via ECRL) Common Causes Radial tunnel syndrome, trauma, compression at the arcade of Frohse Loss of extension of wrist (Option B): Incorrect because wrist extension is not completely lost , as the extensor carpi radialis longus (ECRL) (innervated by the radial nerve before the PIN) is still functional. Loss of supination (Option C): Incorrect because supination is mainly performed by the biceps brachii , with some contribution from the supinator (which is innervated by the PIN but has redundant function from the biceps). Wrist drop (Option D): Incorrect because wrist drop occurs in a proximal radial nerve injury , affecting all extensors, while PIN lesions primarily affect finger extension with wrist extension relatively spared.

It is innervated by the median nerve , which supplies the lumbricals 1 and 2 (the first two lumbricals). The median nerve , which innervates the muscles responsible for thumb abduction and opposition, is formed from the anterior rami of spinal nerves C5 to T1, derived from the brachial plexus. It primarily supplies the anterior forearm muscles and the t henar eminence of the hand, which includes: Muscles of the Thenar eminence: Abductor Pollicis Brevis: Responsible for thumb abduction. Flexor Pollicis Brevis: Assists in thumb flexion. Opponens Pollicis: Enables opposition of the thumb. Lumbricals (Lateral 2): Responsible for flexion at the metacarpophalangeal (MCP) joints and extension at the interphalangeal (IP) joints of the 2nd and 3rd digits Sensory supply: Lateral 3 1 ⁄ 2 digits in the palmar aspect & tip of same digits on the dorsum. .

      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "weakness of the hip abductors , specifically the gluteus medius and gluteus minimus . These muscles are innervated by the superior gluteal nerve . In this case, the right-sided Trendelenburg sign means the right gluteus medius and minimus are weak, which occurs due to damage to the right superior gluteal nerve . Trendelenberg sign: When the body's weight is balanced on one leg, the gluteal muscles on the supported side help elevate the opposite, unsupported side of the pelvis. However, if there is a malfunction in the abductor mechanism, the Sound side sinks, which is referred to as a positive Trendelenburg sign (uncompensated). This sign indicates issues with hip abductors, such as paralysis of the gluteus medius and minimus ; problems with the fulcrum, including congenital or pathological hip dislocations; and concerns related to body weight, such as an unhealed fracture of the femoral neck. When patients with the gluteus medius and minimus paralysis walk, they have a characteristic lurching gait ie, during the single leg supporting phase of walking, there is leaning of the trunk to the affected side known as the compensated Trendelenburg sign . Duck waddling gait is seen when both the sides are affected. Right inferior gluteal nerve (option A): The inferior gluteal nerve innervates the gluteus maximus , which is responsible for hip extension, not abduction. Damage here would cause difficulty rising from a seated position or climbing stairs , not a Trendelenburg sign. Left superior gluteal nerve (option C): If the left superior gluteal nerve were affected, the right hip would drop when standing on the left leg , not the right leg. Left inferior gluteal nerve (option D): The inferior gluteal nerve does not control hip abduction, and the left-sided nerve would not cause a right-sided Trendelenburg sign.",
