      },
      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: C) Stem of lateral sulcus Explanation: The stem of the lateral sulcus (Sylvian fissure) serves as a key surface landmark in the brain. It separates the frontal and temporal lobes and extends posteriorly towards the insular cortex . It is an important landmark for neurosurgical approaches and neurovascular structures. The middle cerebral artery (MCA) runs within the lateral sulcus, supplying a major portion of the cerebral cortex. Lateral Sulcus (Sylvian Fissure) and Its Anatomical Importance Feature Description Location Separates the frontal and temporal lobes Extends to Insular cortex and parietal lobe Contains Middle cerebral artery (MCA) Functions Landmark for neurosurgery, cortical mapping Related Clinical Importance MCA strokes affect motor, sensory, and language functions Pineal gland (Option A): Incorrect because the pineal gland is located near the posterior midline of the brain , not associated with the lateral sulcus. Wernicke’s area (Option B): Incorrect because Wernicke’s area is found in the posterior superior temporal gyrus , although related to the lateral",

      "question": "The bone shown in the image is not associated with which of the following types of joints?",

      "correct_answer": "D",
      "explanation": "joint where the bones are connected by hyaline cartilage. These joints are usually temporary and found in growing bones, such as the epiphyseal plates (growth plates) in children and the first sternocostal joint that unites the first rib to the sternum Synchondrosis or primary cartilaginous joints are not present in the given image Incorrect Options: Option A - Syndesmosis: Definition: A syndesmosis is a type of fibrous joint where bones are connected by a ligament or a sheet of connective tissue. The supraspinous ligament, interspinous ligament, ligamentum flavum (Connecting the lamina of adjacent bones). Posterior longitudinal ligament, anterior longitudinal ligament, these ligaments connects the adjacent vertebrae forming syndesmosis Option B - Symphysis: Definition : A symphysis is a type of cartilaginous joint where the bones are connected by fibrocartilage. Examples: The pubic symphysis. The intervertebral discs. Option C - Plane Synovial Joint: A plane synovial joint, also known as a gliding joint, involves flat or nearly flat articular surfaces that allow bones to slide over one another. The joint between the superior articular facet and inferior articular facet is plain synovial joint and thus makes it an incorrect choice",

      "question": "Which of the following is the type of joint between epiphysis and diaphysis of a long bone?",
      "options": {
        "A": "Symphysis",
        "B": "Synchondrosis",
        "C": "Synostosis",
        "D": "Syndesmosis"
      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: B) Synchondrosis Explanation: Synchondrosis is a type of joint that is a primary cartilaginous joint where the epiphysis and diaphysis of a long bone are connected by a growth plate made of hyaline cartilage. Primary Cartilaginous Joints (Synchondrosis) Secondary Cartilaginous Joints (Symphysis) (Option A) Immobile Occur where ossification centres remain separated by hyaline cartilage. Found in bones that form from more than one ossification centre. Hyaline cartilage here can ossify with age, leading to fusion when growth is completed. Temporary and mainly for growth. Mostly associated with growth plates. The joint between the first rib and the manubrium is a permanent synchondrosis. Slightly mobile Defined by a pad or disc of fibrocartilage between articulating bones, e.g., intervertebral discs. Built to handle a variety of stresses (compression, tension, etc.). Permanent and provide limited movement. Found along the midline (e.g., pubic symphysis, intervertebral joints). Strong ligaments reinforce the joints and are key to stability and movement. Symphyses are built for durability and movement, but they also allow growth in areas like the intervertebral discs. Synostosis (Option C): Synostosis refers to the fusion of bones where the original cartilage is replaced entirely by bone. Syndesmosis (Option D): A syndesmosis is a fibrous joint where bones are connected by a ligament or an interosseous membrane, allowing for limited movement.",

Coracoid process Palpable in the infraclavicular fossa , serves as an attachment site. Inferior angle Palpable at the lower medial end of the scapula. Acromion (Option B-2): Incorrect , as it is palpable over the shoulder , not in the infraclavicular fossa. Lateral angle of scapula (Option C-3): Incorrect , as it is posteriorly palpable , not infraclavicular. Inferior angle (Option D-4): Incorrect , as it is only palpable at the lower scapular border .
