      "question": "A 36-year-old male presents with sharp, stabbing pain in the right upper abdomen for 2 weeks. The pain is aggravated by deep breathing and movement, especially when bending or twisting. There is tenderness over the right costal margin, but no signs of gastrointestinal distress, fever, or abdominal distension. His medical history is unremarkable. What is the most likely diagnosis?",

        "B": "Subcostal neuralgia",
        "C": "Appendicitis",
        "D": "Peptic ulcer disease"
      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: B) Subcostal neuralgia Explanation: Subcostal neuralgia is caused by irritation or compression of the T12 (subcostal) nerve , which provides sensory innervation to the skin of the upper abdomen below the ribcage. It typically presents with sharp, localized pain along the costal margin , especially aggravated by deep breathing or movement (such as twisting or bending). The pain can be unilateral, as seen in this patient. The absence of gastrointestinal symptoms (like nausea, vomiting, or changes in bowel habits), along with localized tenderness over the right costal margin , supports the diagnosis of subcostal neuralgia . Subcostal neuralgia can be caused by various factors, including nerve compression, inflammation, or irritation of the intercostal nerves. It may also follow trauma, surgical procedures (especially abdominal surgeries), or infections. The condition can sometimes occur without any obvious underlying cause. It is typically managed with pain relief, such as non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), and physical therapy to help relieve nerve compression. The intercostal nerves are part of the somatic nervous system and arise from the ventral rami of the T1-T11 spinal nerves. The 12th spinal nerve does not contribute to the intercostal nerves, but rather forms the subcostal nerve . Origin: The intercostal nerves are derived from the ventral rami of the thoracic spinal nerves (T1-T11). Course: These nerves travel along the intercostal spaces between the ribs, passing laterally and then anteriorly toward the sternum. They travel in the costal groove on the inferior aspect of each rib, along with the intercostal artery and vein . The nerves are positioned in the neurovascular bundle along the inferior border of each rib, with the vein superior, the artery in the middle, and the nerve inferior. Branches: Each intercostal nerve gives off several branches: Lateral cutaneous branch: Provides sensory innervation to the skin of the lateral chest and upper abdomen. Anterior cutaneous branch: Supplies the skin over the anterior chest wall. Muscular branches: Innervate the intercostal muscles, transversus thoracis, and sometimes the serratus anterior muscle. Rami communicantes: Connect the intercostal nerve to the sympathetic trunk. Function: Motor: To the intercostal muscles (which aid in respiration). Sensory: To the skin of the chest, abdomen, and parts of the back. Sympathetic: To the sweat glands and blood vessels in the region. IIIIIII IIIIIIIIIIIIII T12 (Subcostal Nerve): The T12 nerve (subcostal nerve) runs below the 12th rib and supplies the muscles of the anterior abdominal wall and skin just below the costal margin. Acute cholecystitis (Option A) typically presents with right upper quadrant pain that is often associated with nausea, vomiting, and fever. The pain tends to be more constant and is aggravated by eating, particularly fatty foods. This patient lacks gastrointestinal symptoms and fever, making cholecystitis unlikely. Appendicitis (Option C) typically starts with periumbilical pain that eventually migrates to the right lower quadrant. It is also accompanied by nausea, vomiting, and fever, which this patient does not have. The pain in",

      "question": "A 48-year-old woman presents to the clinic complaining of a burning, aching sensation on the inner side of her left upper arm. She mentions that about two weeks ago she underwent mastectomy with axillary clearance. She describes the pain as localized along the inner part of the upper arm, extending from the axilla (armpit) to the medial elbow. The pain seems to worsen when she raises her arm. On physical examination, there is tenderness over the left axillary region and the medial upper arm, but no signs of swelling or lymphadenopathy. Based on the patient's history of breast surgery and the clinical presentation, which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?",
      "options": {
        "A": "Radial nerve injury",
        "B": "Cervical radiculopathy (C7)",
        "C": "Intercostobrachial nerve injury",
        "D": "Thoracic outlet syndrome"
      },
      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: C) Intercostobrachial nerve injury Explanation: Intercostobrachial nerve injury is a well-known complication after breast surgery, particularly those involving the axillary region (such as axillary lymph node dissection or mastectomy). This condition is referred to as post-mastectomy pain syndrome when associated with breast cancer surgery. The pain may worsen with arm movements, and in some cases, hyperalgesia (heightened pain sensitivity) in the affected area is noted. The intercostobrachial nerve arises from the second intercostal nerve (T2) and provides sensory innervation to the inner upper arm, the medial side of the axilla, and part of the chest. It is a purely sensory nerve and does not affect motor function. Intercostobrachial nerve injury is a common complication following breast surgery—especially lumpectomy, mastectomy, or axillary lymph node dissection—due to the proximity of the nerve to the axillary region. During these procedures, the nerve can be cut, stretched, or irritated, leading to pain and sensory disturbances in its area of distribution. The patient’s burning and aching pain localized to the inner upper arm after breast surgery, along with hyperalgesia (increased pain sensitivity) over the same area, strongly points to an injury to the intercostobrachial nerve. Radial nerve injury (Option A) typically presents with symptoms like weakness and numbness in the posterior arm, forearm, and dorsal hand, not localized pain along the inner upper arm. Additionally, motor weakness would be present in the arm, which is not the case here. Cervical radiculopathy (Option B)(C7) usually causes pain, numbness, and weakness that radiates from the neck down to the hand, particularly affecting the middle finger and triceps muscle. Thoracic outlet syndrome (Option D) can cause pain and numbness in the neck, shoulder, and upper arm due to compression of the brachial plexus, subclavian artery, or subclavian vein. However, this syndrome usually presents with neurovascular symptoms (e.g., weakness, coldness, or swelling in the arm) and is less likely to cause isolated sensory symptoms .

      },
      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: A) Subclavian vein Explanation: The subclavian vein is a key vessel in the venous system that drains blood from the upper limb, the neck, and part of the chest. It is located in the thoracic region and plays a crucial role in returning deoxygenated blood to the heart. 1. Location and Course: The subclavian vein is positioned deep to the clavicle (collarbone) and lies within the thoracic inlet, a narrow space between the neck and the chest. It runs laterally and horizontally beneath the clavicle, crossing the first rib and passing anterior to the anterior scalene muscle. It continues to run towards the right or left sternoclavicular joint, where it drains into the brachiocephalic vein on both sides (right and left). 2. Relations: Posterior Relations: The subclavian vein is located anterior to the subclavian artery. The clavicle (collarbone) lies above the vein, and it is closely associated with the sternoclavicular joint and muscles like the pectoralis minor. Anterior Relations: The subclavian vein runs posterior to the anterior scalene muscle, which separates it from the subclavian artery. The vein is also related to the first rib, which lies beneath it. Medial Relations: On the medial side, it is adjacent to the brachiocephalic vein. Lateral Relations: The vein continues laterally and joins the internal jugular vein to form the brachiocephalic vein. The thoracic duct (on the left side) drains into the subclavian vein near the junction of the internal jugular vein. The subclavian vein is larger and more anterior and superficial than the subclavian artery. 3. Anatomy: Right subclavian vein: It drains into the right brachiocephalic vein. Left subclavian vein: It drains into the left brachiocephalic vein. Thoracic duct: The thoracic duct drains lymph from the left side of the body into the left subclavian vein near its junction with the internal jugular vein. 4. Clinical Relevance: The subclavian vein is often used for central venous catheter insertion, central venous pressure monitoring. Subclavian vein thrombosis (also known as Paget-Schroetter syndrome) can occur due to repetitive trauma, leading to clots, especially in athletes or individuals with certain anatomical predispositions.",

      "question": "A 65-year-old male patient is admitted to the hospital after undergoing elective surgery. Post-anesthesia, he is found to be unconscious and placed in a supine position for monitoring. The healthcare team is concerned about the risk of aspiration due to his current state. Which location is most likely to collect aspirated material in this patient?",

        "A": "Anterior Basal BPS of the right lower lobe",
        "B": "Posterior BPS of the right upper lobe",
        "C": "Apical Basal BPS of the right lower lobe",
        "D": "Lateral BPS of the right middle lobe"
      },
      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: C) Apical Basal BPS of the right lower lobe Explanation: The Apical Basal BPS of the right lower lobe is the most likely site for aspirated material in a supine, unconscious patient Due to its anatomical position and tendency to collect fluids. Other segments, while dependent, are less favorable for aspiration accumulation. (Option A, B, and D ) Right Lung: Superior Lobe: S1: Apical S2: Posterior S3: Anterior Middle Lobe: S4: Lateral S5: Medial Inferior Lobe: S6: Superior (Apical) S7: Medial Basal S8: Anterior Basal S9: Lateral Basal S10: Posterior Basal Most Dependent Location: Superior segment of right lower lobe Aspiration Risk: Supine posture. Coma and unconscious patients (e.g., post-anesthesia). Collection Sites: Posterior BPS of the right upper lobe. Apical Basal BPS of the right lower lobe. Preferred Collection Site: Apical Basal BPS of the right lower lobe > Posterior BPS of the right upper lobe.",

      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: B) Segments are supplied by segmental arteries and share venous drainage. by a tertiary (segmental) bronchus. Each segment has its own arterial supply, but shares venous drainage with adjacent segments. (Option B) (Option C ) Anatomical, Functional, and Surgical Units: Serve as distinct sectors of the lung. Aerosol Supply: Each segment is supplied by a tertiary (segmental) bronchus. (Option A ) Shape: Pyramidal, with the apex oriented towards the root of the lung. (Option D ) Vascular and Nerve Supply: Contains a segmental bronchus, segmental artery, autonomic nerves, and lymph vessels. Venous Drainage: Segmental venules are located in the connective tissue between adjacent segments. Surgical Resection: Surgeons isolate segments by working along the segmental veins during resection procedures. Reference: BD Chaurasia’s Human Anatomy, Volume 1, 8th Edition, Page 270",
