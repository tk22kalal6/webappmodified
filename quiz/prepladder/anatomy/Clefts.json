      "correct_answer": "D",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: D) Right aortic arch passes in front of the trachea and esophagus Explanation: In a double aortic arch, the right aortic arch passes behind the trachea and esophagus, not in front of it. Double aortic arch: A developmental anomaly in which a vascular ring surrounds the trachea and esophagus. The dorsal aorta is a midline artery dorsal to the gut In normal development, the right dorsal aorta between the origin of the 7th cervical intersegmental artery and its fusion with the left dorsal aorta disappears. In this case, the right dorsal aorta persisted. The right aortic arch passes behind the trachea and esophagus. (Option D) The left aortic arch passes in front of the trachea and esophagus, forming a vascular ring. The vascular ring compresses the trachea and esophagus, leading to dyspnea and dysphagia Reference: Inderbir Singh’s Human Embryology, 11th Edition, Page 173, 243-246, 262.",

      "question": "Which pharyngeal arch primarily contributes to the development of the anterior two-thirds of the tongue?",

        "D": "Fourth pharyngeal arch"
      },
      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: A) First pharyngeal arch Explanation: Development of tongue: Begins around the fourth week of intrauterine life. Anterior 2/3rd of tongue: The development begins with the growth of medial swelling from the first pharyngeal arch known as tuberculum impar. Gradually, two lateral lingual swellings start to grow in the 5th week from the same arch. As the lateral swelling grows in size they eventually merge and overlap tuberculum impar leading to the formation of anterior 2/3rd of tongue. Posterior 1/3rd of tongue: From the mesoderm of the 2nd, 3rd and 4th pharyngeal arches, a median swelling known as hypobranchial eminence begins to develop and forms the posterior 1/3rd of the tongue. Posterior most of tongue: Develops from third median swelling arising from fourth pharyngeal arch. Taste buds development: First sign of taste bud development on lingual epithelium occurs at 8th week of gestation. Between 9-11th week of gestation, many taste bud primordia develop.

      "question": "A 4-year-old child presents with recurrent infections and signs of hypocalcemia. Investigation shows low levels of parathyroid hormone. The physician suspects an embryological defect. Which among the following could be a possible reason?",
      "options": {
        "A": "Defect in the development of 1st pharyngeal pouch",
        "B": "Defect in the development of 2nd pharyngeal pouch",
        "C": "Defect in the development of 3rd pharyngeal pouch",
        "D": "Defect in the development of 5th pharyngeal pouch"
      },
      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: C) Defect in the development of 3rd pharyngeal pouch Explanation : Here the scenario is suggestive of defect in thymus development (recurrent infections) and defect in development of parathyroid gland ( signs of hypocalcemia and low levels of parathyroid hormone). The 3rd pharyngeal pouch is responsible for the development of thymus and inferior parathyroid gland while the 4th pharyngeal pouch is responsible for the development of superior parathyroid gland. Hence, there could be a defect in only the 3rd pharyngeal pouch or defect could be in both 3rd and 4th pharyngeal pouches. Pharyngeal arches, clefts and pouches Pharyngeal arches Pharyngeal arches are key structures in head and neck development, appearing in the fourth and fifth weeks as mesenchymal tissue bars. They resemble gills but do not function as such in humans. Pharyngeal arches are divided by pharyngeal clefts on the outside and pharyngeal pouches on the inside. Pharyngeal pouches develop as outpocketings from the lateral walls of the pharynx and do not connect to the exterior, playing crucial roles in organ development. Each arch incorporates neural crest cells essential for forming facial skeleton components, while mesoderm differentiates into facial and neck musculature. Each arch has its own cranial nerve and artery. Pharyngeal Pouches Four Pairs (fifth is rudimentary) First Pouch : Forms the middle ear cavity and Eustachian tube, contributes to the tympanic membrane. Second Pouch : Develops into palatine tonsils; remnants persist as the tonsillar fossa. Third Pouch: Dorsal wing becomes the inferior parathyroid gland; ventral wing forms the thymus, migrating to the thorax. Fourth Pouch : Dorsal region forms the superior parathyroid gland; ventral region becomes the ultimobranchial body, integrating into the thyroid. Pharyngeal Clefts Five-week-old Embryo: Four clefts are present. First Cleft: Does not form the external auditory meatus (EAM); instead, the EAM arises from surface ectoderm invagination. It eventually disappears due to overgrowth by the second arch. Second, Third, and Fourth Clefts: Overgrown by the second arch, they lose exterior contact and may temporarily form the cervical sinus, which ultimately disappears.",
