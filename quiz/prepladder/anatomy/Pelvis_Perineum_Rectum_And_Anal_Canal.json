      "correct_answer": "D",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: D) Sympathetic: T10-L2; Parasympathetic: S2-S4 Explanation: Urinary bladder is innervated by the vesical plexus, which comprises both sympathetic and parasympathetic fibers, involving both motor and sensory functions. Sympathetic innervation controls bladder filling , whereas the parasympathetic innervation controls bladder emptying. Somatic innervation is responsible for the voluntary control of urination. Type of Innervation Nerves Function Parasympathetic Nerve Fibers (S2, S3, S4) Pelvic splanchnic nerves Excitatory effect on Detrusor muscle Inhibitory to the vesical sphincter. Sympathetic Fibers (T10-L2) Inferior mesenteric plexus Hypogastric plexus Inhibitory effect on Detrusor muscle Motor action on vesical sphincter Somatic Nerve (S1, S2, S3) Pudendal nerve Supplies external urethral sphincter, which is under voluntary control",

      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: C) Puborectalis Explanation: Puborectalis muscle , part of the levator ani muscle, forms a sling around the anorectal junction and is crucial for maintaining the anorectal angle. Dysfunction or atrophy of this muscle can lead to faecal incontinence , especially during increases in intra-abdominal pressure. Resting Tone is mainly provided by Internal Anal Sphincter (IAS) Relaxed External anal sphincter (EAS) and Puborectalis muscle Weakness of External anal Sphincter, Internal anal Sphincter, Puborectalis muscle. Anorectal Ring Muscles Muscle Description Function Significance Internal Anal Sphincter (Option D) Thickened, terminal portion of the inner circular smooth muscle layer of the large intestine. Provides continuous resting tone to the anal canal through sympathetic innervation. Dysfunction can lead to faecal incontinence. External Anal Sphincter (Option A) Main bulk of the anal sphincter complex and is primarily made of striated muscle. Allows voluntary contro l over defecation; allows sustained contraction. Important for voluntary faecal control Conjoint Longitudinal Muscle (Option B) Layer between internal and external anal sphincters; continuous with the outer longitudinal smooth muscle of the rectum. Contracts during defecation , shortening and widening the anal canal, facilitating faecal passage. Plays a role in defecation; age-related decline in muscle fibres can impact function. Puborectalis (Option C) Sling muscle part of the levator ani muscle , surrounding the anorectal junction. Maintains the anorectal angle. Critical for faecal continence",

      "correct_answer": "D",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: D) 2,4 Explanation: Hemorrhoids are variceal enlargement of the submucosal anal and perianal venous plexuses. They are divided into internal and external piles. Internal Hemorrhoids or True piles are usually painless and occur above the dentate line which bleed on straining during defecation. Type of piles Internal Hemorrhoids External Hemorrhoids Location Above pectinate line Below pectinate line Contributing Vein Main tributaries and radicals of Superior rectal vein Tributaries of Inferior rectal vein Common Site 3, 7 and 11 o’clock positions of the anal wall, in the lithotomy position No such common site. Pain Painless (as innervated by splanchnic nerves ) (Statement 4) Painful (innervated by somatic nerves) Bleeding Bleeds on straining at stool Do not bleed on straining Points to know Initially, they are contained within the anal canal (1st degree) , later, they expand and protrude during defecation (2nd degree), and finally, they stay protruded (3rd degree). 2nd-degree piles can be manually reduced if they are prolapsed and not thrombosed. (Statement 2) A thrombosed external haemorrhoid appears as a painful, swollen, bluish lump at the anal verge resulting from the rupture of a subcutaneous vein. (Statement 1) These are located below the dentate line and present as tense hematomas at the anal margin (perianal hematomas). (Statement 3)",

      "question": "A 33-year-old woman in labour is experiencing discomfort and perianal pain and is scheduled to receive a pudendal nerve block. Which anatomical landmarks should the clinician identify to locate the pudendal nerve accurately?",
      "options": {
        "A": "Lesser sciatic notch",

        "D": "Ischial spine"
      },
      "correct_answer": "D",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: D) Ischial spine Explanation: In the pudendal nerve block , the nerve is infiltrated with a local anaesthetic at the point where it crosses the ischial spine using a needle inserted through the vaginal wall, directed by a finger. It aids in achieving almost painless vaginal or forceps deliveries and is also helpful for minor surgeries involving the vagina and perineum. When a bilateral pudendal block is administered, it results in a loss of the anal reflex (saddle anaesthesia), relaxation of the pelvic floor muscles , and diminished sensation in the vulva and lower third of the vagina. Fig: Ischial spine landmark Fig: Pudendal nerve block Lesser sciatic notch (Option A) is the area where the pudendal nerve exits the gluteal region and enters the pudendal canal. It's not easily accessible for the nerve block. Pubic symphysis (Option B): Administering the block here would not accurately target the pudendal nerve and is unlikely to deliver the intended analgesic effect for perineal pain. Greater sciatic notch (Option C) is the point from which the pudendal nerve enters the gluteal region; it is not the preferred site for nerve block.",

      "explanation": "Correct Answer: D) Pectinate line Explanation: Anal canal is divided into upper and lower parts by pectinate line or dentate line (teeth shaped), which forms embryological, neurovascular and histological boundaries. Upper part is supplied by the autonomic nervous system (painless) and the lower by somatic nerves (painful). Lower ends of the anal column are joined by short transverse folds of mucous membranes known as anal valves . Mucosal depressions above these valves are called anal sinuses. Together, the anal valves form a transverse line encircling the anal canal, known as the pectinate line.

It marks the boundary of the mucocutaneous junction. Anorectal junction (Option B) is defined by the forward convexity of the rectal perineal flexure, located just below the tip of the coccyx. Here, the rectal ampulla narrows as it passes through the pelvic diaphragm, aligning with the apex of the prostate in males. Iliopectineal line (Option C) is a ridge located on the inner surface of the pelvis, created by the fusion of the ilium and pubis, extending from the pubic symphysis to the arcuate line of the ilium. This anatomical landmark is significant in clinical practice for directing pelvic surgeries and evaluating conditions that impact the pelvic organs.",
