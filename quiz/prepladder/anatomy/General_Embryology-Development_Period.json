      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: C) Day 4 Explanation: The first week of development begins with fertilization and ends with the initial stages of implantation. The image given shows Morula formation where the zygote becomes a solid ball of 16-32 cells. Cleavage: Once the zygote has reached the two-cell stage, it undergoes a series of mitotic divisions, which become smaller with each cleavage division known as blastomeres. DAY EVENT Day 0 Fertilization: The sperm fertilizes the egg in the fallopian tube, forming a zygote (single diploid cell) Day 1 Two cell stage Day 2 Four cell stage Day 3 Twelve cell stage Day 4 Morula Formation: The zygote becomes a solid ball of 16-32 cells. Day 5 Blastocyst Formation: The morula continues to divide and develops a fluid-filled cavity (blastocoel), which consists of the outer trophoblast (future placenta) and the inner cell mass (future embryo).

      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: B) 16-32 cells Explanation: Morula Early stage in embryo development that occurs around day 3 or day 4 after fertilization. Formed by cleavage of compacted blastomeres. By the time the morula forms, the embryo typically consists of 16-32 blastomeres. The cells in the morula are tightly packed, forming a compact structure that resembles a mulberry. Even though the number of cells increases, the overall size of the morula remains the same as the zygote, because cleavage divisions occur without increasing the embryo's volume. The group of cells present in the centre of morula gives rise to the inner cell mass and embryo proper and cells at the periphery (outer cell mass) are critical in the cavitation of the morula as it transitions into a blastocyst.

        "D": "Release digestive enzymes that help break down the oocyte's nucleus."
      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: B) Prevent polyspermy by modifying the egg's outer membrane. Explanation: Process Mechanism Purpose Acrosome Reaction The acrosome (cap-like structure on the sperm head) releases hydrolytic enzymes (e.g., hyaluronidase, acrosin). These enzymes digest the zona pellucida , allowing the sperm to penetrate and reach the oocyte’s plasma membrane. Allows sperm to penetrate the zona pellucida and fertilize the oocyte. Cortical Reaction The fusion of the sperm with the egg membrane triggers the release of cortical granules (vesicles) into the perivitelline space. The contents of these granules alter the zona pellucida and egg membrane, preventing additional sperm from binding and penetrating. Prevents polyspermy (entry of more than one sperm), ensuring viable embryo development. Zona Reaction Occurs due to the cortical reaction. The enzymes released modify the structure of the zona pellucida, making it impenetrable to other sperm. Prevents further sperm from binding or penetrating the oocyte, ensuring only one fertilizes it.

      "question": "During which phase of the menstrual cycle does implantation typically occur?",

        "D": "Luteal phase"
      },
      "correct_answer": "D",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: D) Luteal phase Explanation: Implantation is a process by which a fertilized egg, or blastocyst, attaches to and embeds itself into the lining of the endometrium. Implantation is the result of mutual trophoblastic and endometrial action. Timing : Begins about 2-4 days after the morula enters the uterine cavity (morula is formed 3-4 days after fertilisation). Blastocyst Stage: The fertilized egg develops into a blastocyst, which is a structure with an inner cell mass, a trophoblast layer, and a blastocoel (fluid-filled cavity). Trophoblast Cells: The outer layer of the blastocyst, called the trophoblast, plays a key role in implantation. These cells adhere to and invade the uterine lining (endometrium). Uterine Lining: Implantation occurs in the endometrium, which is the thickened lining of the uterus, during the luteal phase of the menstrual cycle. Process : The blastocyst attaches to the endometrial lining and begins to burrow into it. Trophoblast cells secrete enzymes that help in embedding the blastocyst and establish a connection with the maternal blood supply. Hormonal Changes: The implantation process triggers the release of hormones, such as human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG), which helps maintain the corpus luteum and prevents menstruation.

      },
      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: A) L-selectin Explanation: Blastocyst: About the time the morula enters the uterine cavity, fluid begins to penetrate through the zona pellucida into the intercellular spaces of the inner cell mass and finally, a single cavity blastocoele formed with blastocyst. Occurs approximately 5 days after fertilization. Inner cell mass/Embryoblast: This will develop into the embryo and the associated extra-embryonic tissues. Outer cell mass/Trophoblast: Forms part of the placenta and facilitate implantation into the uterine wall. Blastocoel: A fluid-filled cavity within the blastocyst that helps the embryo to expand and implant. L-Selectin on trophoblast cells and its carbohydrate receptors on the uterine epithelium mediate the initial attachment of the blastocyst to the uterus. Implantation is the result of mutual trophoblastic and endometrial action. The embryoblast differentiates into epiblast cells dorsally and hypoblast cells ventrally . Some of the hypoblast are specified to form the anterior visceral endoderm (AVE) and become the cranial end of the embryo. Reference: Langman’s Medical Embryology, 14th Edition, Page 43, 44",

      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: B) Gastrulation Explanation: Gastrulation: The most characteristic event occurring during the third week of gestation. The Process of the establishment of all three germ layers (ectoderm, endoderm, mesoderm) from one dimensional layer of epithelial cells, a blastula. Begins with formation of primitive streak on the surface of epiblast and becomes clearly visible as a narrow groove with slightly bulging regions in 15-16 day embryo. The cephalic end of the streak is called the primitive node consisting of a slightly elevated area surrounding the small primitive pit. The migration of the cells of epiblast towards the primitive streak is called invagination . Cell migration and specification are controlled by fibroblast growth factor 8 (FGF8) which is synthesized by streak cells. FGF8 controls cell specification into the mesoderm by regulating BRACHYURY (T) expression. After invagination of cells, some displace the hypoblast creating the embryonic endoderm while others come to lie between the epiblast, a newly created endoderm to form mesoderm. Cells remaining in the epiblast form an ectoderm. The epiblast through the process of gastrulation is the source of all the germ layers. Formation of blastocyst (Option A): The blastocyst forms around the 5th day, much earlier than the 3rd week. Implantation (Option C): Happens around the end of the first week or beginning of the second week. Formation of morula (Option D): The morula is formed on day 3 or 4 after fertilization, before the blastocyst stage, so it’s much earlier than the 3rd week.",

The Midgut of the embryo communicates with the yolk sac via a stalk called the Vitelline duct. Yolk sac: Description A small membranous structure outside the embryo. The yolk sac connects to the developing embryo at midgut via the vitelline duct. (Option B) The primitive yolk sac is lined by Hypoblast cells, which is derived from Endoderm (forms the first lining). Functions Primitive hematopoiesis Germ cell production. Nutritive role (before blood vessels form) Development The primary yolk sac forms from proliferating hypoblast cells after implantation, while the epiblast forms the amnion . Both structures develop between days 8-14 of embryogenesis. Hypoblast cells are continuous with the exocoelomic membrane. By the end of the second week, extraembryonic mesoderm fills the space between the trophoblast, amnion, and exocoelomic membrane. As vacuoles form within this tissue, the extraembryonic coelom or chorionic cavity develops. The extraembryonic mesoderm lining the cytotrophoblast and amnion is called extraembryonic somatic mesoderm , while the lining around the yolk sac is the extraembryonic splanchnic mesoderm . The primary yolk sac enlarges, part of it regresses, and the remaining portion forms the secondary yolk sac. Portions of the secondary yolk sac not taken up inside the embryo forms the tertiary yolk sac. Visualization Timeline Although the yolk sac forms in the second week, it is visible on ultrasound by 5 weeks post-fertilization (or 7 gestational weeks).
