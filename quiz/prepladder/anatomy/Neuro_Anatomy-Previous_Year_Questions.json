Globus pallidus (2) (Internal and External segments) → Affects the output to the thalamus. Substantia nigra (3) (Pars compacta and Pars reticulata) → Modulates the activity of the striatum and globus pallidus. Thalamus (4) → Relays processed signals back to the cortex for movement execution. Direct Pathway: Promotes movement by reducing inhibitory output from the GPi to the thalamus. Mechanism: The striatum inhibits the GPi, leading to less inhibition of the thalamus and increased motor activity. Indirect Pathway: Inhibits movement by increasing inhibitory output from the GPe to the thalamus. Mechanism: The striatum inhibits the GPe, resulting in less inhibition of the STN, which then excites the GPi. This increased activity of the GPi leads to more inhibition of the thalamus and decreased motor activity.

It's caused by a disconnection between language centers in the brain, possibly affecting the Arcuate Fasciculus. This white matter tract links Broca's area (speech production) with Wernicke's area (language comprehension). Damage here can lead to symptoms like those described in conduction aphasia, where patients struggle to repeat words or phrases accurately despite understanding them. Aphasia Type Area Affected Features Broca's Aphasia Left frontal lobe (Broca's area) Non-fluent speech, difficulty forming sentences, good comprehension, and poor writing/speech output. Wernicke's Aphasia Left temporal lobe (Wernicke's area) Fluent speech with normal grammar, but speech is nonsensical or meaningless, poor comprehension. Conduction Aphasia Arcuate fasciculus (connecting Broca's and Wernicke's areas) Difficulty repeating words or phrases, fluent speech with errors, good comprehension. Global Aphasia Widespread damage to left hemisphere (Broca's, Wernicke's, and arcuate fasciculus) Severe communication deficits: non-fluent speech, poor comprehension, and inability to repeat.

Neural tube defects: Category Details Definition Failure of proper closure of neural tube & covering mesoderm/ectoderm; most common congenital CNS anomaly. Inheritance Primary NTDs have multifactorial inheritance. Maternal risk factors Alcohol, radiation exposure, IDDM, valproate, carbamazepine, zinc and folate deficiency. Types of NTDs Spina bifida occulta, meningocele, encephalocele, myelomeningocele, anencephaly, caudal regression syndrome, dermal sinus, tethered cord, syringomyelia, diastematomyelia, lipoma, iniencephaly. Spina bifida occulta Midline defect of vertebral bodies without protrusion of spinal cord or meninges ; usually asymptomatic and not of consequence. Craniorachischisis Rare malformation with skull and spinal bone defects ; brain and nerves exposed ; may have other defects like imperforate anus. Meningocele Meninges herniate through vertebral arches or sacrum; spinal cord norma l. Fluctuant midline mass that may transilluminate. Surgery may be delayed in asymptomatic cases with normal neuro findings and skin covering. Myelomeningocele Most common in lumbosacral region ; sac-like cystic structure with neural tissue; 80% develop hydrocephalus with type II Chiari malformation. Anencephaly Large defect of calvarium, meninges, and scalp; associated with rudimentary brain due to failure of closure of rostral neuropore. Iniencephaly Retroflexion of head with occipital and upper spine defects, nearly absent neck; defect can range from acrania to minimal defect.

Aneurysms of the AComA are the most common intracranial aneurysms and can compress the optic chiasma , leading to bitemporal hemianopia (loss of peripheral vision in both eyes). These aneurysms often present with vision loss, headaches, and possibly subarachnoid hemorrhage if they rupture. Anterior choroidal artery (option B): This artery arises from the internal carotid artery and supplies parts of the optic tract, lateral geniculate body, and posterior limb of the internal capsule . Aneurysms here are rare and typically cause contralateral motor deficits rather than optic chiasma compression. Middle cerebral artery (option C): The MCA does not course near the optic chiasma . MCA aneurysms more commonly affect the lateral convexity of the brain , leading to contralateral hemiparesis, aphasia (dominant hemisphere), or neglect (non-dominant hemisphere). Anterior cerebral artery (option D): The ACA courses superior to the optic chiasma , but aneurysms at this location usually do not cause direct compression.

      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: A) Association and commissural fibers Explanation: The fornix, vital for memory and limbic system functions, comprises association fibers and commissural fibers. Association fibers links nearby brain regions within the same hemisphere, like the hippocampus, mamillary bodies, and septal nuclei. Commissural fibers connect the hippocampus of one hemisphere to its counterpart in the other hemisphere through the anterior commissure. Commissural fibres Projection Association They connect one hemisphere to the opposite side, linking corresponding (homotopic) or different (heterotopic) areas. Eg: Corpus Callosum : The largest commissural structure connecting the two cerebral hemispheres, located at the bottom of the longitudinal fissure. Anterior Commissure : A smaller bundle of nerve fibres crossing the midline at the lamina terminalis. Fornix : Composed of myelinated fibres, it connects the hippocampus to the mammillary bodies in the hypothalamus. It connects the hippocampal formations of the 2 sides Projection fibres connect the cerebral cortex with subcortical structures, including the brainstem and spinal cord, and include both descending (corticofugal) and ascending (corticopetal) fibres. These fibres converge in the corona radiata , pass through the internal capsule , and are flanked by the caudate nucleus and thalamus medially, and the lentiform nucleus laterally. Association tracts connect different areas within the same hemisphere. Eg: Arcuate fasciculus Association and projection fibers (Option B): Projection fibers link the cerebral cortex with other brain areas or the spinal cord. However, projection fibers are not a major component of the fornix. Commissural and projection fibers (Option C): Commissural fibers connect corresponding regions between the two cerebral hemispheres, but projection fibers are not a significant part of the fornix. Association fibers (Option D): Association fibers are involved in connecting different regions within the same hemisphere. However, the fornix also contains commissural fibers.

      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: B) Dopamine Explanation: The marked area corresponds to the substantia nigra, located in the midbrain. It's pivotal for producing and releasing dopamine, a neurotransmitter crucial for motor control, reward and motivation, and emotional regulation. Dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra release dopamine into areas like the basal ganglia, vital for voluntary movements and motor coordination. Internal Structure of the Midbrain The midbrain consists of the posterior part (tectum) and the large anterior part (cerebral peduncle). The cerebral peduncle is divided into three regions: tegmentum , substantia nigra , and crus cerebri . Substantia nigra and crus cerebri remain consistent throughout sections. Crus Cerebri: The medial two-thirds of the crus cerebri contains corticonuclear and corticospinal fibers . The medial one-third of the crus contains frontopontine fibers . The lateral one-third of the crus contains temporopontine , parietopontine , and occipitopontine fibers . Substantia Nigra: A pigmented band of gray matter situated between the tegmentum and the crus cerebri. It is a large motor nucleus that spans the length of the midbrain. The substantia nigra is divided into pars compacta and pars reticularis . It contains melanin (a precursor to dopamine) and iron . The substantia nigra synthesizes dopamine , which is transmitted via axons to the corpus striatum . Acetylcholine (Option A): Acetylcholine influences muscle contraction, memory, and learning, but it's not primarily secreted by the substantia nigra. Glutamine (Option C): Glutamine is an amino acid that serves as a building block for proteins in",

      "explanation": "Correct Answer: D) Fasciculus gracilis Explanation: The medial lemniscus is a continuation of the fasciculus gracilis and fasciculus cuneatus, which are part of the dorsal column-medial lemniscus pathway. This pathway carries sensory information related to fine touch, vibration, and proprioception from the lower body (fasciculus gracilis) and upper body (fasciculus cuneatus) to the brain. The fasciculus gracilis and fasciculus cuneatus are composed of ascending sensory fibers that originate from the dorsal root ganglia in the spinal cord.

      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: B) Midbrain Explanation: The superior cerebellar peduncle, also known as the brachium conjunctivum, is one of the three major fiber tracts that connect the cerebellum with the rest of the brain. It is located on the dorsal aspect of the brainstem. The decussation of the superior cerebellar peduncle refers to the crossing over of its fibers from one side of the brainstem to the other. This decussation occurs at the level of the midbrain, specifically in the region called the upper midbrain tegmentum. Cerebellar Peduncle: It connects the cerebellum to the brainstem. Superior cerebellar peduncle connects the cerebellum to the midbrain. Middle cerebellar peduncle connects the cerebellum to the pons. Inferior cerebellar peduncle connects the cerebellum to the medulla. Pons (Option A): While the pons is involved in the transmission of various neural signals, the decussation of the superior cerebellar peduncle does not occur at this level. Diencephalon (Option C): The diencephalon, housing the thalamus and hypothalamus, lies above the midbrain. The superior cerebellar peduncle's decussation doesn't happen within the diencephalon. Medulla (Option D): While the medulla is involved in various vital functions, including cardiovascular and respiratory control, the decussation of the superior cerebellar peduncle does not occur at the level of the medulla.

      "correct_answer": "D",
      "explanation": "of pain and temperature sensation on the right side of the face , along with loss of pain and temperature sensation on the left leg —are indicative of a lateral medullary syndrome , also known as Wallenberg syndrome . In this condition, there is damage to the lateral part of the medulla . This syndrome typically involves the spinothalamic tract (for pain and temperature sensation), the descending trigeminal tract (for facial sensation), and other structures like the nucleus ambiguus (which affects the motor function of the larynx and pharynx). Wallenberg Syndrome (Lateral Medullary Syndrome) Due to stroke or infarction in the lateral part of the medulla oblongata. Mainly due to occlusion of the posterior inferior cerebellar artery (PICA), a branch of the vertebral artery. Sometimes the vertebral artery directly supplies the lateral brainstem. Affects the dorsolateral aspect of the medulla and the inferior surface of the cerebellum. Anatomical structure affected and features: Spinothalamic tract: Contralateral loss of pain and temperature sensation of the trunk. Spinal nucleus and tract of the trigeminal nerve: Ipsilateral loss of pain and temperature sensation of the face. Nucleus ambiguus: Ipsilateral paralysis of muscles of the palate, pharynx, and larynx. Inferior cerebellar peduncle and cerebellum: Ipsilateral ataxia. Vestibular nuclei: Giddiness. Medial medulla (option A): Lesions here typically affect the medial lemniscus (responsible for touch and proprioception) and corticospinal tract (which affects motor function). This would cause contralateral weakness and loss of touch/proprioception , but not facial pain/temperature loss . Lateral pons (option B): Lesions in the lateral pons often affect the spinothalamic tract and trigeminal nerve (similar to the lateral medulla), but this would typically involve contralateral body symptoms, not the contralateral leg . The face could have sensory loss on the same side , but the involvement of the left leg would point more toward the medulla . Medial pons (option C): A lesion here would primarily affect structures like the corticospinal tract , abducens nucleus , and the medial lemniscus , leading to contralateral motor deficits and sensory loss of the body. Facial pain/temperature loss would not occur with a medial pontine lesion.",

      "correct_answer": "D",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: D) Superior cerebellar artery (SCA) Explanation: The SCA supplies the superior part of the cerebellum and parts of the midbrain.

      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "not used for identifying the facial nerve trunk because it is located in the lower neck and does not have any anatomical relation to the facial nerve . The facial nerve exits the stylomastoid foramen and is identified in the parotid region , where it divides into its branches. Origin: The facial nerve arises from the pons, a part of the brainstem, at the pontomedullary junction. Pathway: After its origin, the facial nerve enters the internal acoustic meatus along with the vestibulocochlear nerve (CN VIII). It then travels through the facial canal within the temporal bone. Key Structures Along Its Course Geniculate Ganglion: Located within the facial canal, this is a sensory ganglion where the nerve fibers for taste (from the anterior two-thirds of the tongue) and some general sensory fibers synapse. Branches within the Facial Canal: Greater Petrosal Nerve: Arises from the geniculate ganglion, carrying parasympathetic fibers to the lacrimal gland and nasal mucosa. Chorda Tympani: This branch arises after the geniculate ganglion and carries taste fibers from the anterior two-thirds of the tongue and parasympathetic fibers to the submandibular and sublingual salivary glands. Exit from the Skull Stylomastoid Foramen: The facial nerve exits the skull here, located between the styloid and mastoid processes of the temporal bone. Extracranial part of facial nerve: Entry into Parotid Gland The main trunk enters on the posteromedial surface of the parotid gland. Division of Nerve Divides within the gland, behind and superficial to the retromandibular vein and external carotid artery (ECA). Temporofacial vs. Cervicofacial Trunks Temporofacial trunk: Contains more axons but fewer fascicles. Cervicofacial trunk: Contains more fascicles but fewer axons. Formation of Parotid Plexus The trunks branch further to form the parotid plexus (pes anserinus) from which the terminal branches arise. Terminal Branches Temporal, zygomatic, buccal, marginal mandibular, and cervical. Incorrect Options: Retrograde dissection from distal branch (option A): In cases where the main trunk is difficult to locate, tracing a distal branch backward helps in identifying the facial nerve trunk . Tragal pointer (option B): The tragal pointer (cartilaginous structure of the external auditory canal) is an important surgical landmark, located about 1 cm anterior and inferior to the stylomastoid foramen , where the facial nerve trunk emerges . Posterior belly of digastric (option D): The posterior belly of the digastric muscle is another key landmark. The facial nerve trunk is located just superior to this muscle at its attachment to the mastoid process.",

      "question": "An elderly woman reports difficulty in buttoning her shirt and increased clumsiness during daily activities. On examination, she is unable to make an 'O' shape by opposing her thumb and index finger. Which of the following muscles is most likely involved?",
      "options": {
        "A": "Opponens pollicis",
        "B": "Abductor pollicis brevis",
        "C": "Flexor pollicis brevis",
        "D": "Palmar interossei"
      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: B) Abductor Pollicis Brevis Explanation: The patient’s inability to make an 'O' shape with the thumb and index finger (tip-to-tip pinch) is a classical sign of anterior interosseous nerve (AIN) syndrome , which is a pure motor branch of the median nerve . The AIN innervates deep forearm muscles , specifically: Flexor pollicis longus Lateral half of flexor digitorum profundus Pronator quadratus Hence, the actual motor deficit is due to involvement of FPL and FDP to the index , not due to abductor pollicis brevis or any thenar muscle. However, none of the muscles directly innervated by AIN are listed in the options. Among the choices, the only muscle purely and entirely innervated by the median nerve is abductor pollicis brevis , making it the most appropriate answer based on: The nerve implicated (median), The pattern of weakness, And the available options. Muscles of the Palm: Functions and Innervations Muscle Group Muscles Function Innervation Thenar muscles • Abductor pollicis brevis • Flexor pollicis brevis • Opponens pollicis • Abducts thumb • Flexes thumb • Opposes thumb AbPB: Median nerve (recurrent branch) FPB: Dual (Median + Ulnar) OP: Median (variable) Hypothenar muscles • Abductor digiti minimi • Flexor digiti minimi brevis • Opponens digiti minimi Controls movement of little finger Ulnar nerve (deep branch) Lumbricals • 1st & 2nd (lateral) • 3rd & 4th (medial) Flex MCPs and extend IP joints Lateral 2: Median nerve Medial 2: Ulnar nerve Palmar interossei • Three muscles (unipennate) Adduction of fingers (PAD) Ulnar nerve (deep branch) Dorsal interossei • Four muscles (bipennate) Abduction of fingers (DAB) Ulnar nerve (deep branch) Adductor pollicis • Oblique and transverse heads Adducts the thumb Ulnar nerve (deep branch) Palmaris brevis • One small superficial muscle Tenses skin over hypothenar eminence Ulnar nerve (superficial branch) Opponens pollicis (Option A): Incorrect because it is mainly innervated by the median nerve , but may receive a contribution from the ulnar nerve ( dual innervation ). Also, it is responsible for thumb opposition, not for the tip-to-tip pinch affected in AIN palsy. Flexor pollicis brevis (Option C): Incorrect. It has dual innervation (superficial head by median, deep head by ulnar). Not purely median. Palmar interossei (Option D): Incorrect. These are ulnar nerve -innervated muscles, unrelated to thumb-index pinch or median nerve pathology. Reference: Gray's Anatomy: The Anatomical Basis of Clinical Practice, 42nd Edition, Page No: 980",

      "explanation": "involves both sensory and motor components. The sensory component of the gag reflex is mediated by the glossopharyngeal nerve (cranial nerve IX), which detects the stimulus at the back of the throat. The motor component is controlled by the vagus nerve (cranial nerve X), which causes the muscles in the throat to contract. Injury to either of these nerves can result in an absent gag reflex. Incorrect Options: Option B - 10 and 7: While cranial nerve X (vagus) is involved in the gag reflex, cranial nerve VII (facial nerve) is not. The facial nerve primarily controls muscles of facial expression, not the gag reflex. Option C - 7 and 5: Incorrect: Cranial nerve V (trigeminal) provides sensation to the face and motor control for mastication, and cranial nerve VII controls facial expression. Neither of these nerves is involved in the gag reflex. Option D - 5 and 9: While cranial nerve IX (glossopharyngeal) is involved in the gag reflex, cranial nerve V (trigeminal) is not.

      },
      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: A) Anterior nucleus of thalamus Explanation: The marked structure is the fornix. Fornix is the major efferent tract of the hippocampus. The fornix sends efferents to the mammillary bodies, and the mammillothalamic tract connects the mammillary bodies to the anterior nucleus of the thalamus. This pathway is part of the Papez circuit, involved in memory and emotional processing. Thalamic Nuclei and their Connection: Anterior nucleus Receives input from hypothalamic mammillary nuclei via mammillothalamic tract. Receives input from the hippocampus via fornix. Projects fibers to the cingulate gyrus. Dorsomedial nucleus Part of the limbic system. Lesion results in memory loss (Wernicke–Korsakoff syndrome). Intralaminar nuclei Receives input from the reticular formation. Projects fibers to the neocortex. Sends fibers to other thalamic nuclei (unlike other thalamic nuclei, which project to different cortical areas). Dorsal tier nucleus Lateral dorsal nucleus : Posterior extension of the anterior nucleus. Pulvinar : Largest thalamic nucleus. Receives input from the lateral and medial geniculate bodies. Integrates visual and auditory input. Ventral tier nucleus Ventral anterior nucleus : Receives input from globus pallidus and substantia nigra. Projects fibers to the motor cortex. Ventral posterior nucleus : Contains three subnuclei: Ventral posterolateral (VPL) : Receives input from spinothalamic tracts and medial lemniscus. Ventral posteromedial (VPM) : Receives input from trigeminothalamic tracts. Ventral posterior inferior (VPI) : Receives input from vestibular nuclei. Lateral nucleus of thalamus (Option B): The lateral nucleus functions as the hunger center, promoting eating when stimulated, while its destruction leads to starvation. Ventro-postero-lateral nucleus of thalamus (Option C): The ventro-postero-lateral nucleus of the thalamus processes sensations like pain, vibration, proprioception, and light touch from the spinothalamic tract and dorsal column pathways.

It forms a thinner layer located laterally. A longitudinal strip found between the paraxial and lateral plate mesoderm. It forms: Somitomeres: Form mesoderm and muscles of the head and jaw. Somites: Form midline axial skeleton, skeletal muscles and dermis of back. It forms: Somatopleuric (parietal) layer: Forms connective tissue of the body wall and limbs, such as appendicular skeleton bones , muscles and dermis of periphery. Splanchnopleuric (visceral) layers: Forms connective tissue and smooth muscle layers of the gut, cardiac muscle and the circulatory system. It forms: Urinary and genital systems. Somites: Paraxial mesoderm becomes segmented to form 42-44 pairs of somites develop on either side of the neural tube and notochord. Appear between the 20th and 30th day, marking the 4th week as the somite period. Somite Structure: Sclerotome: Ventromedial part; forms vertebral column and ribs.
