        "D": "3, 4, and 5"
      },
      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: C) 3 and 5 Explanation: While the atlanto-occipital joint allows some lateral bending , it is not the primary joint responsible for this movement. Lateral bending of the head is more significantly facilitated by the atlantoaxial joint (between the atlas and axis, C1 and C2) and the cervical spine below. The atlantoaxial joint allows for rotational movements and contributes to lateral flexion. Atlanto-Occipital Joint The atlanto-occipital joint is a synovial joint formed between the atlas (C1) and the occipital bone of the skull. Here are key features: Structure: This joint consists of the superior articular facets of the atlas, which articulate with the occipital condyles of the skull. Function: It primarily allows for nodding movements (flexion and extension), often described as \"yes\" movements. Anatomy: The odontoid process (or dens) is a peg-like structure that projects from the body of the axis (C2). It is crucial for the stability and functionality of the cervical spine. The odontoid process is held in place by the transverse ligament of the atlas, which prevents excessive backward movement of the atlas relative to the dens. In the case of fusion, it can be assumed that the body of C1 and C2 may appear fused if there are pathological changes or congenital anomalies. Atlanto-Axial Joint The atlantoaxial joint is another synovial joint located between the atlas (C1) and axis (C2), and it has specific characteristics: Structure: This joint consists of the dens of the axis fitting into the anterior arch of the atlas. Function : It primarily facilitates rotational movements of the head, allowing for the \"no\" movement. Anatomy: The atlantoaxial joint is classified as a pivot or trochoid joint, enabling rotational movement around the central axis formed by the dens. The transverse ligament again plays a key role by stabilizing the odontoid process and allowing for controlled rotation of the skull and atlas around the dens.",

        "D": "Depth to the subarachnoid space is approximately 1.4 cm in neonates."
      },
      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: C) Supracristal plane corresponds to the L4-L5 vertebral level. Explanation: In infants , the supracristal plane intersects the vertebral column at L3-L4, not L4-L5. Lumbar Puncture: Aspect Adults Neonates and infants Spinal Cord Termination Terminates at the level of L1-L2. Terminates between L1 and L3 in neonates. Conus Medullaris Location Around the L1 and L2 lumbar vertebra and can sometimes be lower. Commonly at the lower third of L1 vertebral body (range: lower third of T12 to L2/L3 intervertebral disc). Supracristal Plane A line between the highest points of the iliac crests intersects the vertebral column around L4 or the L4/L5 intervertebral disc; this may vary from the L2/L3 to L5/S1 level. In most adults, the plane intersects the vertebral column inferior to the termination of the spinal cord. Intersects the vertebral column at L3-L4 level in children. It may vary from L2/L3 to L5/S1 interspinous space. (Option C) Ultrasound Guidance Not routinely used. May be preferable to avoid overlap between the supracristal plane and the termination of the spinal cord. (Option B) Positioning Patients can be seated or lying on their side (lateral decubitus) on a firm, flat surface. Flex the lumbar spine to separate the vertebral spines maximally and expose the ligamentum flavum. Infants should be positioned to maximize convex curvature to the lumbar spine, either lying or sitting. Needle Insertion Insert the needle between the spines of L3 and L4 or L4 and L5, and anesthetize the skin and soft tissues. Performed between spinous processes of either L3 and L4 or L4 and L5, using a trocar needle and into subarachnoid space below the level of conus medullaris. (Option A) Depth to Subarachnoid Space: Approximately 1.4 cm in neonates, increasing with age. (Option D) Needle Puncturing Needle Path Technique Lumbar puncture needle inserted in the midline or just to one side. Angle the needle in the horizontal and sagittal planes to pierce the ligamentum flavum in or near the midline. Slight loss of resistance as the needle enters the epidural space. Careful advancement to pierce the dura and arachnoid to release CSF.",

      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: C) Upper border of L3 Explanation: By the end of fetal development, the spinal cord terminates at the upper border of the L3 vertebra. Fetus : Initially, the spinal cord and vertebral column are the same length. The vertebral column grows faster, causing the spinal cord to ascend. Ascent milestones: Begins around 9 weeks . Reaches the last sacral vertebra by 12 weeks. Attains the lower border of S1 by 15 weeks. Reaches the lower border of L4 at 6 months. Reaches the lower border of L3 at full term . (Option C) Child : The spinal cord terminates at the upper border of L3 . Adult : The spinal cord ends at the lower border of L1 (Option A) known as the conus medullaris. Below this level, the vertebral canal contains the cauda equina. Clinical significance: Lumbar puncture in adults must be done below L2 at the level of L3-L4 or L4-L5 laminae as this avoids injury to the spinal cord. In children, it is done at the lower level of L4. Reference: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9671389/",

      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: B) L4-L5 Explanation: The patient's symptoms suggest nerve root compression, commonly caused by a herniated disc. The key findings in this case include lower back pain radiating down the left leg, numbness over the top of the foot, and weakness in dorsiflexion of the great toe (extensor hallucis longus), without reflex abnormalities. These are classic signs of L5 nerve root involvement. L5 nerve root compression, often due to L4-L5 disc herniation, results in: Weakness in great toe dorsiflexion (extensor hallucis longus). Sensory loss over the dorsum of the foot. Radiating pain down the lateral aspect of leg. Slipped disc: A herniated disc, also known as a slipped disc, occurs when the soft center (nucleus pulposus) of a spinal disc pushes through a tear in the tougher exterior (annulus fibrosus) and presses on nearby nerves. Herniated discs most commonly occur in the cervical (neck) and lumbar (lower back) spine. Here's an explanation of herniated discs affecting both the cervical and lumbar regions. Cervical Slip Disc (Upper Limb Involvement): In the cervical region, the nerves exit above their corresponding vertebrae (except for the C8 nerve). The affected nerve root, in the case of a herniated disc, is typically the one corresponding to the lower vertebra in the pair. Cervical Slip Discs and Affected Nerve Roots Herniated Disc Between Compressed Nerve Root Symptoms (Upper Limb) C4 and C5 C5 Shoulder pain, weakness in deltoid muscle C5 and C6 C6 Pain in biceps, weakness in wrist extension C6 and C7 C7 Triceps weakness, difficulty extending the elbow C7 and T1 C8 Hand weakness, difficulty with finger movements Lumbar Slip Disc (Lower Limb Involvement) In the lumbar region, the nerves exit below their corresponding vertebrae. Therefore, when a disc herniation occurs between two vertebrae, the nerve root corresponding to the lower vertebra is usually compressed. Lumbar Slip Discs and Affected Nerve Roots Herniated Disc Between Compressed Nerve Root Symptoms (Lower Limb) L3 and L4 L4 Weakness in knee extension, reduced patellar reflex L4 and L5 L5 Weakness in foot dorsiflexion, difficulty walking L5 and S1 S1 Pain down the back of the leg, reduced Achilles reflex, foot drop Regional Prevalence: Cervicothoracic (C6-T1): 10% of cases Lumbosacral (L4-S1): 90% of cases Thoracic: Rare L3-L4 (Option A): Compression at this level typically affects the L4 nerve root, causing weakness in knee extension (quadriceps) and decreased sensation over the medial side of the lower leg. This is not consistent with the patient's symptoms. L5-S1 (Option C): Compression here would affect the S1 nerve root, causing weakness in plantarflexion (gastrocnemius), decreased ankle reflex, and sensory loss along the lateral aspect of the foot. This does not match the patient's findings. T12-L1 (Option D): This is much higher in the vertebral column and would affect muscles and sensations around the lower abdomen and upper thighs, which are unrelated to the symptoms described in this case.",

        "D": "Curvature related to increased abdominal weight"
      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: B) Secondary curvature Explanation: Lumbar lordosis is a secondary curvature that becomes evident in infancy as the child begins to assume upright posture, stand and walk, contributing to normal posture development. Vertebral Curvature: Vertebral column in adults has 4 curvatures: Cervical lordosis Thoracic kyphosis Lumbar lordosis Sacral kyphosis Types of Vertebral Curvature: Primary Curvature Secondary Curvature Developmental. Thoracic and sacral kyphosis (both concave anteriorly) are primary curvatures. (Option A & C) Develop during the fetal period in response to the flexed fetal position. Are in the same direction as the main curvatures of the fetal vertebral column. Retained throughout life due to differences in height between the anterior and posterior parts of the vertebrae. Acquired in relation to the erect human posture. Cervical and lumbar lordosis (both concave posteriorly) are secondary curvatures. Result from extension from the flexed fetal position. Begin to appear during the late fetal period but do not become obvious until infancy (roughly, 1st year). Secondary curvatures are primarily maintained by differences in the thickness between the anterior and posterior parts of the intervertebral (IV) discs. Cervical lordosis becomes evident when an infant begins to raise (extend) the head while prone and to hold the head up while sitting. Lumbar lordosis appears when toddlers (children learning to walk) begin to assume upright posture, standing and walking. It is more pronounced in females. (Option B) Functional Importance: Curvatures of the vertebral column enhance flexibility (shock-absorbing resilience), augmenting the passive flexibility provided by the intervertebral (IV) discs. Response to Increased Load: When bearing heavy loads (e.g., carrying a heavy backpack), both the IV discs and curvatures are compressed, increasing the curvature. Impact of Additional Anterior Weight: Carrying weight in front of the body’s normal gravitational axis (e.g., large breasts, obesity, pregnancy, or carrying a child) tends to increase these curvatures.

      "correct_answer": "D",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: D) Transverse process Explanation: Transverse processes project laterally from the pediculolaminar junctions and serve as levers for muscles and ligaments mainly involved in spinal rotation and lateral flexion. Typical Vertebra Has a ventral body, dorsal arch with processes, and a vertebral foramen. Image Vertebral Body Adjacent vertebral bodies are connected by fibrocartilage discs. Form a flexible, weight-supporting central axis. Transmits even greater forces generated from attached muscles. Vertebral Arch Consists of pedicles and a broader laminae. Transverse, superior, and inferior articular processes project from the junction of the pedicle and lamina. Vertebral Foramina Formed by the vertebral arch and body. Contains the spinal cord, meninges and their vessels. Intervertebral Foramina Located between adjoining vertebrae, near junctions of vertebral bodies and arches. Transmit mixed spinal nerves, small recurrent nerves, and blood and lymphatic vessels. Spinous Processes (Option A) Project dorsally from the junction of the lamina. Act as levers for muscles that control posture and active movements (flexion/extension, lateral flexion and rotation) of the vertebral column. Transverse Processes (Option D) Project laterally from the pediculolaminar junctions. Serve as levers for muscles and ligaments, mainly concerned with rotation and lateral flexion. Articular Processes (Option B & C) Superior articular processes project cranially with dorsal facets; inferior articular processes project caudally with ventral facets. They form zygapophysial or facet joints and form part of the posterior boundaries of intervertebral foramina, permitting only limited vertebral movement. Trabecular Structure Vertebrae are internally composed of trabecular bone with an outer shell of compact bone perforated by vascular foramina. Trabecular interior contains red bone marrow and basivertebral veins. Reference: Gray’s Anatomy, 42nd Edition, Pages 822, 823",

      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: C) Lumbar vertebrae Explanation: Lumbar vertebrae are characterized by their large size, thick and horizontal spinous processes , and the absence of transverse foramina (which are present in cervical vertebrae) or costal facets (which are found in thoracic vertebrae). Feature Cervical Vertebrae (Option A) Thoracic Vertebrae (Option B) Lumbar Vertebrae (Option C) Image Size Small size Intermediate-size Large size Body Small , broad with a convex anterior surface. Waisted cylinder ; nearly equal transverse and AP dimensions. Wider transversely Vertebral Canal Triangular Small and circular Triangular Pedicles and Laminae Pedicles: Attach midway between the discal surface of the vertebral body. Lamina: Thin , slightly curved . Pedicles: Do not diverge as the vertebral foramen is small and circular Lamina: Short , thick , and broad. Pedicles: Short Laminae: Broad and short . Spinous Process Short , bifid with two unequal tubercles. Slants downward. Almost horizontal, quadrangular, and thickened along its posterior and inferior borders. Transverse Process Composite structure Large, club-like. Long, thin. Superior Articular Facets Flat and ovoid, directed superoposteriorly . Directed posteriorly and slightly superolaterally . Bear vertical concave facets facing posteromedially . Inferior Articular Facets Directed mainly anteriorly . Directed forwards and slightly superomedially . Have vertical convex articular",

      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: C) C Explanation: The subarachnoid space , which contains cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), is likely compromised after spinal surgery due to potential puncture of the dura or arachnoid. Epidural Space (Option A) Subdural Space Subarachnoid Space Located between the spinal dura mater and the periosteum. Contains: Loose areolar tissue Semiliquid fat Spinal arteries supplying deeper structures Internal vertebral venous plexus. Epidural anesthesia is given here Potential space between the dura and arachnoid mater. (Option B) Contains a thin layer of serous fluid. Allows movement of the dura over the arachnoid. Extends onto spinal nerves and connects with lymphatic spaces. Wide space between pia mater and arachnoid mater. Filled with cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) . (Option C) Cushions the brain and spinal cord. Wider in the spinal region, especially below the spinal cord where it encloses the cauda equina. Lumbar punctures are typically performed between L3 & L4 vertebrae. Periosteal space (Option D) is not a recognized anatomical space for CSF.",

        "D": "It measures about 50 cm in length"
      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: B) Distal part of it is called the coccygeal ligament. Explanation: The marked structure in the given image is the Filum terminale and it consists of 2 parts: filum terminale internum and the distal filum terminale externum, also known as the coccygeal ligament . Filum terminale is a thread-like extension of the pia mater (Option A) measuring about 20 cm in length. (Option D) Location : Extends from the tip of the conus medullaris to the base of the coccyx. Pathway : Pierces the dural tube, traverses the sacral canal and sacral hiatus (Option C) and attaches to the dorsal surface of the first coccygeal vertebra. Segments Filum Terminale Internum : Approximately 15 cm long, located within the dural sac. Filum Terminale Externum : About 5 cm long, situated outside the dura mater, below the second sacral vertebra . Composition : Primarily pia mater, with some nerve fibers from the second and third coccygeal nerves on its outer surface. The central canal of the spinal cord extends into it for about 5 mm.",
