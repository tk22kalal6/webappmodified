        "A": "Intramembranous ossification",

        "D": "Perichondral ossification"
      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: B) Endochondral ossification Explanation: There are two major modes of osteogenesis which involve transformation of pre-existing mesenchymal tissue into bone tissue. Membranous Ossification Endochondral Ossification Bone forms directly from mesenchymal tissue without a cartilage intermediate. Cranial vault forms through membranous ossification Bones that undergo membranous ossification: Flat bones of the skull which include bones like the frontal bone parietal bones nasal bones lacrimal bones squamous part of the temporal and occipital bones Maxilla and Mandible (except the condylar process of the mandible, which forms by endochondral ossification). Process : Mesenchymal cells differentiate into osteoblasts, which start forming bone directly by secreting osteoid (bone matrix). This process is characteristic of the bones that contribute to the vault of the skull (calvaria). Bone is formed by first creating a cartilage template, which is then replaced by bone. Cranial base forms though endochondral ossification Bones that undergo endochondral ossification: Base of the skull: Occipital bone ( except the squamous part ) Sphenoid bone Ethmoid bone Petrous part of the temporal bone Condyle of the mandible. Process : In endochondral ossification, a cartilage model of the bone forms first. This cartilage is progressively replaced by bone as it is calcified and invaded by blood vessels, bringing osteoblasts and osteoclasts to reshape the bone. Note-Occipital bone is a membranocartilaginous bone since the part above nuchal line is formed by membranous ossification and rest is formed by cartilagenous ossification",

      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: A) Frontal, parietal, temporal and sphenoid bones Explanation: Pterion, the junction where the frontal, parietal, temporal, and sphenoid bones meet is deemed the skull’s weakest part. Skull sutures: Cranial sutures are syndesmosis between the cranial bones. Syndesmosis is fibrous joint between 2 bones. Sutures Meeting Point Coronal suture Junction between the frontal and parietal bones Sagittal suture Junction between the parietal bones Lambdoid suture Junction between the parietal and occipital bones Squamous suture Junction between the parietal and temporal bones Bregma : The point where the sagittal suture and the coronal suture meet. In infants, the anterior fontanelle eventually ossifies and forms the bregma. Lambda : The point where the sagittal suture and lambdoid suture meet. Anterior Fontanelle Posterior Fontanelle A soft spot in a newborn’s skull, located at the junction of the sagittal, coronal and frontal (metopic) sutures. Located at the junction of the sagittal suture and the lambdoid suture. It is diamond-shaped. It is triangular in shape. Typically closes by 18-24 months of age. Typically closes usually by 6 to 8 weeks after birth.",
