      "question": "A 5-year-old child presents with conductive hearing loss. Imaging reveals a congenital anomaly involving the stapes footplate. Which embryological structure is primarily responsible for the development of the stapes footplate?",
      "options": {
        "A": "First pharyngeal arch",
        "B": "Second pharyngeal arch",
        "C": "Otic placode",
        "D": "Otic capsule"
      },
      "correct_answer": "D",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: D) Otic capsule Explanation: The stapes footplate develops from the otic capsule, a cartilaginous structure that surrounds the inner ear during development and later ossifies to form the bony labyrinth. This capsule provides structural support and protection to the inner ear, which originates from the otic placode. (Option C) Embryology of Ear Development of Auricle: Begins with proliferations from the first and second pharyngeal arches. By the 6th week, six tubercles form around the first branchial cleft, which fuse to create the auricle. Most of the auricle arises from the second pharyngeal arch, while the tragus and anterior meatus are derived from the first. The lobule is the last part to develop. By the 20th week of gestation, the pinna reaches its final adult shape. External Auditory Meatus is developed by invagination of the first branchial cleft . Middle Ear: Includes the Eustachian tube, Tympanic cavity, Attic, Antrum, and Mastoid air cells, which develop from the endoderm of the tubotympanic recess Ossicles: Malleus and incus from the first arch (Option A) Stapes from the second arch (Option B) The Footplate of Stapes and annular ligament originates from the Otic capsule . Membranous Inner Ear: The ectoderm ( neuroectoderm ) in the hindbrain region thickens to form an Auditory placode, which invaginates into the auditory vesicle (otocyst) that develops into: Endolymphatic duct and sac Utricle and semicircular ducts Saccule and cochlea Tympanic Membrane: Outer Layer : Ectoderm Middle Layer : Mesoderm (fibrous) Inner Layer : Endoderm (mucosal) After a perforation , a healed tympanic membrane usually has only the ectoderm and endoderm , since the fibrous layer may not fully regenerate depending on the extent of damage.",

      "question": "A 60-year-old patient presents with dizziness and balance issues. The physician suspects a problem in the vestibular system. Which of the following structures is primarily responsible for detecting horizontal linear acceleration and head position relative to gravity?",
      "options": {
        "A": "Saccule",
        "B": "Utricle",
        "C": "Semicircular canals",
        "D": "Organ of Corti"
      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: B) Utricle Explanation: The Utricle is a part of the vestibular system that detects horizontal linear acceleration and head position in relation to gravity, whereas the Saccule is responsible for vertical linear acceleration. The semicircular canals detect rotational movements. The Organ of Corti contains hair cells that convert sound vibrations into neural signals and are responsible for hearing. Anatomy of the Inner Ear The inner ear comprises two main components: Membranous Labyrinth : A closed system of sacs and ducts filled with endolymph. Bony Labyrinth : A rigid structure that encases the membranous labyrinth, with the space between them filled with perilymph. Membranous Labyrinth Components: Cochlear Duct (Scala Media): It is located within the bony cochlea and contains the spiral organ of Corti, which is essential for hearing. Has a spiral structure with 2¾ turns , positioned between the scala vestibuli and scala tympani. Base: Formed by the osseous spiral lamina and the basilar membrane. Roof: Formed by the vestibular membrane (Reissner’s membrane). Sound Transmission: Sound Waves → Travel through Perilymph (Scala vestibuli → Helicotrema → Scala tympani) → Generate fluid waves → Cause Basilar membrane to vibrate → Stimulate hair cells(Organ of Corti) → Convert sound vibrations into electrical signals → Sent to brain via Cochlear nerve. Saccule: A small sac within the vestibule, connected to both the cochlear duct and utricle. Detects vertical movements via sensory receptors known as maculae. Utricle: A larger, oblong sac that connects to the semicircular ducts. Primarily detects horizontal movements and head tilting through maculae. Semicircular Ducts: Located within the bony semicircular canals. Contain Cristae ampullaris for detecting angular acceleration and maintaining kinetic balance. Bony Labyrinth Components Cochlea: Converts sound waves into mechanical vibrations. Structurally allows separation of sound frequencies, with higher frequencies detected at the basal coil and lower frequencies heard at the apical coil. Vestibule: Central cavity situated between the cochlea and semicircular canals. Semicircular Canals: Three canals are oriented at right angles to each other, opening into the vestibule. Vital for balance and spatial orientation, containing sensory structures (maculae in the vestibule and cristae in the semicircular canals) that detect head movements and positional changes.",

      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: A) Downward, backward and lateral Explanation: The scenario describes a condition known as Epiphora in the bilateral eye, characterized by excessive tearing. The canal involved in this condition is the Nasolacrimal Duct , which runs downward, backwards, and laterally. Lacrimal glands produce tears and are located in the eye, draining into the nose through a membranous passage known as the nasolacrimal duct. Massage in the direction of NLD encourages drainage and can assist in relieving blockages. Nasolacrimal duct Length 18 mm Extent It extends from the lacrimal sac and opens anteriorly into the inferior meatus of the nose. Orientation Runs downwards, backwards and laterally (Option A) Valve Hasner’s valve: An incomplete mucous fold at the lower end of the duct, preventing air from entering the duct and blowing into the eye when one blows their nose to clear nasal secretions. Clinical aspect Epiphora: Excessive secretion of the lacrimal fluid overflowing on the cheeks. It may occur due to: Hyperlacrimation: Excessive secretion of tears (intake of spicy food or emotional outbreak) Obstruction in lacrimal passages (lacrimal punctum, lacrimal canaliculi, lacrimal sac and nasolacrimal duct) Ectropion (eversion of lower eyelid). Patency evaluation Jones dye test 1 & 2 are procedures to assess the patency of the nasolacrimal duct and identify problems related to tear drainage.",

      "question": "Which of the following arteries is not typically injured during mandibular fracture repair?",
      "options": {
        "A": "Inferior alveolar artery",
        "B": "Lingual artery",
        "C": "Facial artery",
        "D": "Maxillary artery"
      },
      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: C) Facial artery Explanation: Facial artery: The facial artery supplies blood to the face, but it is typically not directly involved in mandibular fractures. It is less likely to be injured in mandibular fracture repair, as it is located more superficially and does not directly supply the mandible. Mandibular fractures often involve injury to the arteries that supply the mandible and its surrounding structures. Inferior alveolar artery (Option A): This artery, which is a branch of the maxillary artery, is commonly injured during mandibular fractures, especially in fractures of the body or angle of the mandible. Lingual artery (Option B): The lingual artery, which supplies the tongue and floor of the mouth, can also be injured in fractures of the mandibular body or ramus. It is often at risk during fractures near the midline or in the region of the tongue. Maxillary artery (Option D): This major artery supplies blood to the mandible through its branches, such as the inferior alveolar artery. It is closely related to the mandible, as it originates behind the neck and passes between the ramus and the sphenomandibular ligament.
