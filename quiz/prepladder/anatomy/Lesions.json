      "question": "A patient with a humeral fracture presents with difficulty extending the elbow and wrist. Which of the following nerves is most likely affected?",
      "options": {
        "A": "Radial nerve",
        "B": "Median nerve",
        "C": "Ulnar nerve",
        "D": "Axillary nerve"
      },
      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "Correct answer: A) Radial nerve Explanation: Radial nerve innervates the extensor muscles of the upper limb , including the triceps brachii (for elbow extension) and the extensor muscles of the forearm (for wrist extension). It passes through the spiral groove of the humerus and is therefore at risk in humeral shaft fractures. Damage to the radial nerve leads to wrist drop (inability to extend the wrist) and loss of elbow extension. Nerves Related to Humerus Nerve Location Relative to Humerus Axillary Nerve (Option D) Around the surgical neck of the humerus. Musculocutaneous Nerve It originates from the lateral cord of the brachial plexus, pierces coracobrachialis, travels between biceps and coracobrachialis. Radial Nerve (Option A) Passes through the spiral groove of the humerus, posterior to the brachial artery, anterior to the long head of triceps. Median Nerve (Option B) Passes anterior to the humerus, but does not innervate upper arm muscles. Ulnar Nerve (Option C) Travels down the medial side of the brachium, behind the medial epicondyle of the humerus. Reference: B. D.

      "question": "A 35-year-old office worker presents with numbness and tingling in her thumb, index, and middle fingers. The physician taps over the ventral aspect of the wrist, reproducing her symptoms. Which test is the physician likely performing?",
      "options": {
        "A": "Tinel's sign",
        "B": "Phalen's test",
        "C": "Finkelstein's test",
        "D": "Froment's test"
      },
      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: A) Tinel's sign Explanation: The patient experiences numbness and tingling specifically in her thumb, index, and middle fingers which are classic indicators of median nerve compression , often associated with carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS). Tinel's sign involves tapping or pressing over the median nerve at the wrist, which can reproduce symptoms of carpal tunnel syndrome , such as numbness and tingling in the fingers. Carpal tunnel Syndrome: Causes (Median nerve compression): Tenosynovitis of flexor tendons (idiopathic) Myxedema (thyroxine deficiency) Fluid retention during pregnancy Fracture dislocation of the lunate bone Osteoarthritis of the wrist Clinical Features: Pain and Sensation: Burning pain or \"pins and needles\" in the sensory distribution of the median nerve (lateral 3½ digits), often worse at night. Sensory Preservation: No sensory loss over the thenar eminence, as it is supplied by the palmar cutaneous branch of the median nerve, which lies superficial to the flexor retinaculum. Muscle Weakness: Weakness in the thenar muscles. Deformity: \" Ape-thumb deformity \", due to paralysis of the thenar muscles. Diagnostic Tests: 1. Tinel’s sign (tingling upon percussion over the flexor retinaculum) 2. Phalen’s test (symptoms reproduced by wrist flexion) (Option B) 3. Nerve Conduction: Reduced conduction velocity in the median nerve (<30 m/s) is indicative of the condition. 4. PEN Test: Patient places their hand in a supine position on a table and is asked to touch a pen with their thumb. Thumb abduction is not possible due to median nerve compression, which is positive for carpal tunnel syndrome. Treatment: Nighttime symptoms due to involuntary wrist flexion may respond to splinting. For recent onset symptoms , particularly those related to pregnancy or synovial thickening, corticosteroid injections may provide relief. Persistent symptoms , especially with evidence of axonal damage, often require surgical intervention, typically involving the division of the flexor retinaculum. Finkelstein's test (Option C) is used to diagnose De Quervain's tenosynovitis. It requires the patient to make a fist with the thumb inside and then ulnar deviate the wrist. Froment's sign (Option D) assesses ulnar nerve function by checking for weakness in pinching paper between the thumb and index finger.",

        "A": "Flexor carpi radialis",
        "B": "Radial nerve",
        "C": "Ulnar nerve",
        "D": "Median nerve"
      },
      "correct_answer": "D",
      "explanation": "Correct answer: D) Median nerve Explanation: The median nerve passes through the carpal tunnel and is most commonly affected in the slash injuries that cut across the palmar side. Wrist slash injuries commonly occur due to suicide cuts at wrist and can lead to: Loss of sensation in the thenar eminence Loss of sensation in the lateral 3 and half digits on palmar side Motor loss of LOAF muscles Atrophy of thenar eminence Ape thumb deformity Wrist Slash Injuries Nerves affected Median nerve Ulnar nerve (less common) : Innervates the intrinsic muscles of the hand (like the hypothenar muscles and lumbricals for the ring and little fingers ), and it also provides sensory innervation to the little finger and half of the ring finger. (Option C) Arteries affected Radial artery Ulnar artery Flexor carpi radialis (Option A) is a muscle of the anterior forearm that primarily contributes to wrist flexion and abduction but it does not affect thumb opposition or sensation in the thenar eminence. Radial nerve (Option B) provides motor innervation to the extensor muscles of the forearm and sensory innervation to the dorsal side of the hand but it does not involve in the thumb opposition, and numbness in the thenar eminence.",

        "D": "Ulnar nerve"
      },
      "correct_answer": "D",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: D) Ulnar nerve Explanation: Ulnar nerve (C7, C8 & T1) originates from the medial cord of the brachial plexus, running along the medial side of the brachial artery in the arm. It passes posterior to the medial epicondyle of the humerus and enters the forearm between the two heads of the flexor carpi ulnaris , travelling between it and the flexor digitorum profundus. At the wrist, the nerve passes through Guyon’s canal into the hand, where it divides into superficial and deep branches , providing motor and sensory innervation to the hand. Damage to the ulnar nerve leads to: Difficulty in flexing the fourth and fifth fingers due to paralysis of the flexor digitorum profundus (medial part) and the lumbricals (3rd and 4th). Inability to adduct the thumb, as the adductor pollicis is also innervated by the ulnar nerve. Motor branches of Ulnar nerve: Ulnar nerve (C7, C8 & T1- Root Values) Muscle Action Anterior Forearm Flexor carpi ulnaris Medial half of flexor digitorum profundus Flexion and adduction of hand at wrist Flexion of distal phalanges.

Injured in shoulder dislocations or surgical neck fractures of the humerus. It causes weakness in arm abduction and sensory loss over the lateral shoulder but does not affect finger flexion or thumb adduction. Radial nerve (Option B): Injured in humeral shaft fractures, which leads to wrist drop and sensory loss over the posterior forearm but does not impair finger flexion or thumb adduction. Median nerve (Option C) : Commonly injured in carpal tunnel syndrome or supracondylar fractures . It causes difficulty flexing the index and middle fingers and loss of thumb opposition, but it does not affect the fourth and fifth fingers or thumb adduction.",

        "A": "Long thoracic nerve",
        "B": "Dorsal scapular nerve",
        "C": "Suprascapular nerve",
        "D": "Accessory nerve"
      },
      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "Correct answer: A) Long thoracic nerve Explanation: Winging of the scapula and inability to protract the scapula are signs of long thoracic nerve injury , which innervates the serratus anterior muscle and its paralysis causes these symptoms. It also causes difficulty to hit the opponent with that hand in boxing and inability to make stores in swimming, hence it's also called Boxer’s or Swimmer’s palsy. Etiology : Long thoracic nerve injury is common in Trauma Surgeries (mastectomy) Repetitive overhead movements (like swimming) Recurrent shoulder dislocations. Long Thoracic Nerve Origin C5 - C7 Insertion Serratus anterior muscle , which is responsible for scapular protraction and upward rotation . Nerve actions (Motor function) Protracts the scapula (pulls it forward around the thorax). Assists in arm anteversion (moving the arm forward). Lifts the ribs , aiding in respiration. Responsible for the anterolateral motion of the scapula , which is necessary for arm elevation . Dorsal scapular nerve (Option B) innervates the rhomboids and levator scapulae muscles, which affect scapular retraction and elevation but not protraction. Suprascapular nerve (Option C) innervates the supraspinatus and infraspinatus muscles, which are primarily responsible for shoulder abduction and external rotation . It wouldn't affect scapular protraction. Accessory nerve (Option D) innervates the trapezius muscle, which is responsible for shoulder shrugging and upper back movement . Damage here might lead to weakness in shoulder elevation and scapular motion but not in protracting the scapula. Reference: B. D. Chaurasia’s Human Anatomy, Volume-1, 8th Edition, Page 69, 74, 201",

      "question": "A 25-year-old male sustains a traumatic shoulder dislocation after a motor vehicle accident. On examination, the patient is unable to abduct his arm beyond 15 degrees and experiences numbness over the lateral shoulder. Which of the following nerve injury is the most likely cause of his symptoms?",

        "A": "Suprascapular nerve",
        "B": "Axillary nerve",
        "C": "Subscapular nerve",
        "D": "Long Thoracic nerve"
      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Correct answer: B) Axillary nerve Explanation: The most likely cause of this patient's symptoms is an axillary nerve injury , given the nerve's close proximity to the shoulder joint and the typical presentation of shoulder abduction weakness along with numbness over the lateral shoulder after a traumatic dislocation. The axillary nerve provides motor innervation to the deltoid and teres minor muscles , and sensory innervation to the area over the lower part of the deltoid muscle . Common Causes of Axillary Nerve Injury: Intramuscular injections : It should be given in the middle of the deltoid muscle to avoid axillary nerve injury. Fracture of surgical neck of humerus. Inferior dislocation of humerus. Symptoms: Inability to abduct shoulder joint ( Deltoid paralysis ). Loss of sensation in lower half of the deltoid ( regimental-badge area ). Loss of the rounded contour of the shoulder due to Deltoid muscle atrophy. Prominence of the greater tubercle of the humerus (due to muscle wasting). Suprascapular nerve (Option A) innervates the supraspinatus (initiation and continuation of shoulder abduction ) and the infraspinatus ( externally rotates the shoulder ) but it does not supply sensation to the skin over the shoulder, which makes it an unlikely cause of the sensory loss in this patient. Subscapular nerve injury (Option C) innervates the subscapularis muscle , responsible for internal rotation of the shoulder and adduction of the arm. It does not typically affect abduction or cause numbness over the lateral shoulder. Long thoracic nerve injury (Option D) innervates the serratus anterior muscle , which is responsible for scapular protraction and upward rotation . This does not cause weakness in shoulder abduction or numbness over the lateral shoulder.",

      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: B) At the spiral groove Explanation: The patient presents with: Wrist drop → paralysis of wrist extensors Weakness in elbow extension → partial triceps involvement Sensory loss over posterior arm and lateral dorsum of hand These findings localize the lesion to the spiral groove of the humerus, where: The long head of triceps is spared → elbow extension is weak but not absent Wrist and finger extensors are affected → wrist drop Sensory loss involves posterior forearm and dorsum of hand Injuries of the Radial Nerve: Location Causes Symptoms Axilla (Option A) Crutch palsy Motor Loss: Triceps paralysis (loss of elbow extension) Wrist drop d/t ECRL involvement Finger drop d/t involvement of extensor digitorum Loss of digit extension Sensory Loss: Posterior arm Lateral part of dorsum of the hand Narrow strip on the back of the forearm Spiral Groove (Option B) Midshaft humeral fractures Incorrect intramuscular injections Direct pressure (Saturday night palsy). Motor Loss: Loss of wrist and finger extension ( wrist drop & Finger drop ). Impaired supination (when the arm is extended). Weakness in elbow extension- partial triceps involvement Sensory Loss: Limited to a small area between the first and second metacarpals over dorsum of hand.

        "D": "Opponens pollicis"
      },
      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: C) Adductor pollicis Explanation: In this scenario, the patient flexes the distal phalanx of the thumb to grip the paper when the examiner attempts to pull it away, indicating weakness in the adductor pollicis muscle, which is innervated by the ulnar nerve , thereby confirming a positive Froment's test. Froment’s test: Tests Adductor pollicis supplied by Ulnar nerve. The patient is asked to hold a piece of paper (or a card) between the thumb and index finger of the affected hand & card is pulled out. Positive Result: If the patient flexes the distal phalanx of the thumb while attempting to hold the paper, it indicates weakness of the adductor pollicis muscle due to ulnar nerve dysfunction. This flexion occurs due to flexor pollicis longus innervated by the median nerve. Flexor pollicis brevis (Option A) primarily flexes the thumb without significantly contributing to grip strength. Abductor pollicis brevis (Option B) aids in thumb abduction. Opponents pollicis (Option D)",

      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: C) Lumbricals Explanation: The given image depicts the Ulnar claw hand due to the paralysis of the ulnar lumbricals. Lumbricals normally flex the metacarpophalangeal (MCP) joints and extend at the interphalangeal (IP) joints. Impairment of the function of lumbricals due to ulnar injury creates the characteristic appearance of claw hand in the ring and little finger. Ulnar Nerve: Arises from the medial cord of the brachial plexus (C8, T1 ) with contributions from C7. Course : Axilla : Lies medial to the axillary artery. Arm : Descends along the medial side of the brachial artery, piercing the medial intermuscular septum to enter the posterior compartment. It runs behind the medial epicondyle of the humerus in the cubital tunnel. Forearm : Passes between the heads of flexor carpi ulnaris & Branches are: Muscular : Flexor carpi ulnaris, medial half of flexor digitorum profundus. Palmar Cutaneous : Sensory innervation to hypothenar eminence. Dorsal Cutaneous : Sensory to medial dorsum of the hand and medial 1½ fingers. Hand : Superficial Branch : Supplies palmaris brevis and sensory to medial 1½ fingers. Deep Branch : Enters Guyon’s canal, innervating intrinsic hand muscles (except thenar and first two lumbricals). Injury to Ulnar Nerve: At the Elbow At the Wrist Causes : Fracture/dislocation, cubital tunnel syndrome, compression by flexor carpi ulnaris. Causes : Vulnerable to cuts, and compression in Guyon’s canal.

      "explanation": "Correct Answer: B) Guyon’s canal Explanation: The given clinical scenario of tingling in the ring and little fingers, weakness of intrinsic hand muscles, atrophy of the hypothenar eminence, and a positive Froment's sign are characteristic of Ulnar nerve compression in Guyon’s canal. Ulnar nerve supply in the hand: Ulnar nerve travels alongside the ulnar artery and gives off a palmar cutaneous branch before reaching the flexor retinaculum, supplying the ulnar side of the palm & enters Guyon’s canal & divides into: Superficial Branch: Supplies the skin of the medial 1½ fingers & Palmaris brevis. Deep Branch: Supplies all intrinsic muscles of the hand except muscles of thenar eminence & 1st two lumbricals and terminates supplying Adductor pollicis , aka Graveyard of Ulnar nerve. Guyon’s Canal (Ulnar Tunnel Syndrome): (Option B) Compression of the ulnar nerve within Guyon’s canal at the wrist. Clinical Features: Claw-Hand Deformity: Ring and little fingers exhibit pronounced ulnar claw hand when compared to injury of the ulnar nerve at the elbow (ulnar paradox) due to preserved function of the FDP, resulting in marked flexion of DIP joints. Atrophy of the Hypothenar Eminence Loss of Finger Abduction and Adduction Positive Froment’s Sign: Unable to hold the book between thumb and index indicates weakness in the adductor pollicis . DIP Of thumb compensates for adductor pollicis weakness and thumb flexion occurs. Flexor Retinaculum: A strong fibrous band that spans the anterior concavity or palmar surface of the carpus, forming the carpal tunnel for the passage of flexor tendons of the digits . It is a modification of the deep fascia that thickens in front of the carpal bones. Attachments: Medially: Attached to the pisiform and the hook of the hamate. Laterally: Attached to the scaphoid tubercle & crest of the trapezium. Relations: Structures Passing Superficial to the Flexor Retinaculum (medial to lateral) Structures Passing Deep to the Flexor Retinaculum (through the carpal tunnel) Ulnar Nerve & Artery Palmar cutaneous branch of ulnar nerve Tendon of palmaris longus Palmar cutaneous branch of median nerve Superficial palmar branch of radial artery Tendons of flexor digitorum superficialis (FDS) Tendons of flexor digitorum profundus (FDP) Tendon of flexor pollicis longus (FPL) Median nerve Cubital tunnel (Option A): Compression here affects the ulnar nerve proximally but would cause symptoms in both hand and forearm muscles, and not isolated hypothenar wasting. Carpal tunnel (Option C) is formed by the carpal bones and flexor retinaculum, contains the median nerve and flexor tendons . Compression of median nerve occurs in carpal tunnel syndrome, causing symptoms like tingling and weakness in the thumb, index, middle, and part of the ring finger. Palmar aponeurosis (Option D) is a fibrous tissue structure that supports the skin of the palm and anchors it to underlying muscles and tendons . Conditions like Dupuytren’s contracture (due to thickening and shortening of the palmar fascia) may affect it, but they do not present with the specific ulnar nerve symptoms seen in this patient.",

      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: C) Median nerve injury at the elbow Explanation: The given symptoms, including the inability to flex the index and middle fingers, suggest a median nerve injury at the elbow , resulting in the \"benediction deformity.\" Median Nerve (C5 - T1): Median nerve is a major nerve of the upper limb. It is formed by two roots: Lateral Root: Fibers from C5 , C6 , and C7 , originating from the lateral cord. Medial Root: Fibers from C8 and T1 , originating from the medial cord. Course: Origin: Arises from the lateral and medial roots of the brachial plexus (C5-T1) in the axilla. Axilla: Lies lateral to the third part of the axillary artery. Arm: Initially lateral to the brachial artery, it crosses in front at the mid-humerus. Cubital Fossa: Medial to the brachial artery, giving branches to the forearm flexors , except flexor carpi ulnaris and medial half of flexor digitorum profundus. Forearm: Passes between the two heads of the pronator teres, giving off the anterior interosseous nerve , which supplies: Flexor pollicis longus Lateral half of the flexor digitorum profundus Pronator quadratus Wrist: Gives the palmar cutaneous branch before entering the carpal tunnel. Hand: After entering the palm, it divides into recurrent and palmar digital branches, supplying thenar muscles and sensory innervation to the lateral 3½ digits. Median Nerve Injuries: At the Elbow Lower Injury (Carpal Tunnel Syndrome) Causes: Supracondylar fractures, tight tourniquets/entrapment by the pronator teres Causes: Compression due to tenosynovitis and fractures. Symptoms: Loss of forearm pronation & weak wrist flexion. Benediction deformity (index and middle fingers remain straight when attempting to make a fist) (Pointing index finger) D/t involvement of FDS & FDP Ape-thumb deformity (flattened thenar eminence, thumb adducted). Sensory loss in the lateral palm and lateral 3½ digits. Weak \"OK sign\" d/t involvement of FDP & FPL Symptoms: Burning pain/tingling in Lateral 3½ Digits, especially at night. No sensory loss over the thenar eminence Ape thumb deformity Thenar muscle wasting Can make a fist (Pointing index finger not present) Anterior Interosseus Nerve Injury: Pure motor nerve supplying FPL , FDP & Pronatar quadratus Causes: Fractures of the radius (e.g., Galeazzi fractures) or humeral shaft fractures, forearm compartment syndrome Cannot form “O” with Index finger and Thumb. No Ape thumb deformity & sensory loss.",

        "A": "C5 - C7",
        "B": "C5, C6",
        "C": "C8, T1",
        "D": "C5 - T1"
      },
      "correct_answer": "D",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: D) C5 - T1 Explanation: Median nerve , which innervates the muscles responsible for thumb abduction and opposition , is formed from the anterior rami of spinal nerves C5 to T1, derived from the brachial plexus. It primarily supplies the anterior forearm muscles and the thenar eminence of the hand, which includes: Muscles of the Thenar eminence: Abductor Pollicis Brevis: Responsible for thumb abduction. Flexor Pollicis Brevis: Assists in thumb flexion. Opponens Pollicis: Enables opposition of the thumb. Lumbricals (Lateral 2): Responsible for flexion at the metacarpophalangeal (MCP) joints and extension at the interphalangeal (IP) joints of the 2nd and 3rd digits Sensory supply: Lateral 3½ digits in the palmar aspect & tip of same digits on the dorsum. Brachial Plexus: The brachial plexus is a network of nerves formed by the anterior rami of the lower four cervical nerves ( C5, C6, C7, C8 ) and the first thoracic nerve ( T1 ) Components of the Brachial Plexus: Roots : Five roots (C5 to T1), deep to the scalenus anterior muscle. Trunks : Upper trunk : C5 and C6 Middle trunk : C7 Lower trunk: C8 and T1 Divisions : Located behind the clavicle. Cords : Three cords form from the divisions Lateral cord: Anterior divisions of the upper and middle trunks. Medial cord: Anterior division of the lower trunk. Posterior cord: Posterior divisions of all three trunks Branches: From Roots Long thoracic nerve (C5, C6, C7) Dorsal scapular nerve (C5) From Trunks Suprascapular nerve (C5, C6) Nerve to subclavius (C5, C6) Lateral Cord Lateral pectoral nerve (C5, C6, C7) Lateral root of median nerve (C5, C6, C7) Musculocutaneous nerve (C5, C6, C7) Medial Cord Medial pectoral nerve (C8, T1) Medial cutaneous nerve of arm (C8, T1) Medial cutaneous nerve of forearm (C8, T1) Medial root of median nerve (C8, T1) Ulnar nerve (C7, C8, T1) Posterior Cord Radial nerve (C5, C6, C7, C8, T1) Axillary nerve (C5, C6) Thoraco-dorsal nerve (C6, C7, C8) Upper subscapular nerve (C5, C6) Lower subscapular nerve (C5, C6)",

      },
      "correct_answer": "D",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: D) Anterior interosseous nerve Explanation: The muscle marked ‘X’ is the Pronator quadratus , one of the deep muscles of the forearm and is supplied by the Anterior interosseous nerve, a branch of the Median nerve . Median nerve: Begins in the axilla, at the level of the lower border of the teres major muscle, from the medial and lateral cords of the brachial plexus. It descends through the arm without branching, travelling alongside the brachial artery. It passes through the cubital fossa, enters the forearm between the heads of the pronator teres , and runs deep to the flexor digitorum superficialis. In the hand, it enters through the carpal tunnel , supplying the thenar muscles (except adductor pollicis) and 2nd and 3rd lumbricals . Motor Branches of the Median Nerve: Median Nerve (C5 to II T1- root value) supply of forearm Muscle Action Superficial muscles (Supplied by Median Nerve itself) Pronator teres Pronation of the forearm. Flexor carpi radialis Palmaris longus Flexion of the wrist. Flexor digitorum superficialis Flexion of the proximal interphalangeal (PIP) joints of the fingers. Deep muscles (supplied by Anterior interosseous nerve) Flexor digitorum profundus (lateral half) Flexion of the distal interphalangeal (DIP) joints of the index and middle fingers. Flexor pollicis longus Flexion of the thumb. Pronator quadratus Pronation of the forearm. Ulnar nerve (Option A) primarily innervates the intrinsic muscles of the hand & provides sensory innervation to the skin over the Hypothenar eminence and the central area of the palm. Posterior interosseous nerve (Option B) is a deep branch of the radial nerve and it mostly supplies the",
