      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: B) Macrocephaly without significant symptoms Explanation: BEH in infants is defined by an increase in head size (macrocephaly) without accompanying significant neurological symptoms. It is often self-limiting and can be monitored. Benign External Hydrocephalus Definition Increase in subarachnoid space volume with minimal ventricular enlargement, leading to macrocephaly (large head). Causes Impaired CSF absorption because of arachnoid villi immaturity Venous defects Clinical features Increased head circumference- raised ICP Poor motor development Hypotonia, vomiting and seizures. Investigations Through CT or MRI imaging showing subarachnoid space widening; Clinical assessment. Treatment Conservative Observation: For cases without significant symptoms. Surgical Options: Considered if increased ICP or other complications are present (e.g., ventriculoperitoneal shunt). Severe neurological symptoms (Option A): BEH is characterized by macrocephaly without significant neurological symptoms. Infants with BEH typically do not exhibit major cognitive or physical impairments. Necessitates immediate surgical intervention (Option C): BEH generally does not require immediate surgical intervention. Most cases are mild and self-resolving; surgery is only considered if there are complications or increased intracranial pressure. Increased ventricular enlargement (Option D): In BEH, there is an increase in the subarachnoid space volume with minimal or no enlargement of the ventricles. This distinguishes it from other types of hydrocephalus where ventricular enlargement is more prominent.

      "question": "A 5 year old boy came with complaints of sudden onset weakness in his lower limbs. His parents mention a history of viral illness with fever and sore throat. On examination, the boy has flaccid paralysis of his legs with muscle wasting, absent deep tendon reflexes, and no sensory deficits. Which of the following structures is primarily affected in this condition, leading to muscle paralysis and wasting?",
      "options": {
        "A": "Posterior white columns of the spinal cord",
        "B": "Anterior grey columns of the spinal cord",
        "C": "Spinothalamic tract",
        "D": "Cerebellar peduncles"
      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: B) Anterior grey columns of the spinal cord Explanation: The clinical scenario of this child points to a diagnosis of poliomyelitis due to the history of acute flaccid paralysis following fever and lower motor neuron involvement. Poliomyelitis primarily affects the anterior grey columns, leading to lower motor neuron damage, causing muscle paralysis and wasting. Poliomyelitis : Viral infection of anterior grey columns of the spinal cord and cranial nerve motor nuclei. Causes muscle paralysis and wasting, often affecting lower limbs more. Severe cases can impair respiration and affect facial, pharyngeal, laryngeal, and tongue muscles. It is a lower motor neuron palsy. Posterior white columns of the spinal cord (Option A): These columns are responsible for sensory functions, not motor control. Spinothalamic tract (Option C): This tract transmits sensory information related to pain and temperature, not motor function. Cerebellar peduncles (Option D): These are involved in coordinating movement, not directly causing paralysis associated with poliomyelitis.",
