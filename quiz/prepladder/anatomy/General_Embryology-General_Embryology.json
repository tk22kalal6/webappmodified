      "explanation": "Correct Answer: D) Tertiary yolk sac connects to the midgut via the vitellointestinal duct. Sac: Yolk sac is an endodermal sac lying ventral to the embryonic disc. Considered a vestigial structure in humans with hardly any nutritive yolk inside it. Develops from the cavity of blastocyst (blastocele). 3 stages of development: Primary yolk sac: Blastocyst cavity (blastocele) becomes the primary yolk sac when it is lined by Heuser’s membrane (flattened cells from endoderm of embryoblast). (Option A) Heuser's membrane attaches to the undersurface of the embryonic disc. Formed by the end of the second week. (Option C) Secondary yolk sac: With the formation of extraembryonic coelom, the primary yolk sac becomes smaller and is termed as secondary yolk sac. Cells lining the yolk sac become cuboidal. (Option B) IIII Tertiary (definitive) yolk sac: Remnant of the secondary yolk sac. As the embryo folds, most of the yolk sac is incorporated into the embryo to form the primitive gut. Remaining portion not absorbed into the embryo is termed as tertiary/definitive yolk sac. It communicates with the midgut via the vitellointestinal duct. (Option D) Functions of Yolk Sac: Hemopoiesis: Produces blood for the embryo until the liver is formed during the sixth week. Primitive gut formation: Dorsal portion of the yolk sac forms the primitive gut. Primordial germ cells formation: Primordial germ cells form from the yolk sac wall and migrate to the developing gonads during the fourth week, where they develop into primitive germ cells (spermatogonia or oogonia). Allantois formation: A small diverticulum called the allantois arises from the caudal part of the yolk sac.",

      "explanation": "→ Canalicular phase → Saccular phase → Alveolar phase. Correct answer: B) Pseudoglandular phase → Canalicular phase → Saccular phase → Alveolar phase. Explanation: The development of the lungs follows a well-defined sequence: Pseudoglandular phase (5–16 weeks): Formation of terminal bronchioles. Canalicular phase (16–26 weeks): Formation of respiratory bronchioles and capillary networks. Saccular phase (26–36 weeks): Formation of primitive alveoli and and capillaries establish close contact. Alveolar phase (36 weeks–postnatal): Formation of mature alveoli and blood-air barrier. Premature Birth and RDS: The onset of surfactant production in the canalicular phase and its increase during the saccular phase is essential for preventing alveolar collapse. Premature infants born before 34 weeks are at significant risk for Respiratory Distress Syndrome (RDS) due to insufficient surfactant production and immature alveolar development. Treatment includes surfactant replacement therapy and supportive ventilation . Reference: Langman’s Medical Embryology, 14th Edition, Page 227,228",

      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Correct answer: B) Appearance of the lung bud Explanation: The first sign of respiratory development is the appearance of the lung bud (also called the respiratory diverticulum ) It appears as an outgrowth from the ventral wall of the foregut around the 4th week of embryonic development. Development depends on retinoic acid (RA) produced by adjacent mesoderm, which upregulates the transcription factor TBX4 . This marks the initiation of lung formation and the beginning of the respiratory system's development. Formation of primary bronchi (Option A) occurs later in development, around the 5th week . Development of type I alveolar cells (Option C) : Type I alveolar cells, which are involved in the formation of the blood-air barrier, begin to form later during the canalicular phase (16–26 weeks). Formation of the tracheoesophageal septum (Option D) occurs shortly after the appearance of the lung bud and serves to separate the respiratory tract from the esophagus.

      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Correct answer: B) Abnormal development of the left anterior cardinal vein Explanation: A persistent left-sided SVC arises from the left anterior cardinal vein , which typically regresses during fetal development. Normal Development : The right anterior cardinal vein forms the right SVC . The left anterior cardinal vein regresses, with its remnant forming the left brachiocephalic vein , which connects the left and right venous systems. Persistent Left-Sided SVC : Occurs due to the failure of the left anterior cardinal vein to regress . This results in the formation of a left-sided SVC , which drains into the right atrium through the coronary sinus . The right SVC typically develops normally. Double SVC : If the left brachiocephalic vein fails to form , the left anterior cardinal vein persists as a separate venous channel. In this condition: The right anterior cardinal vein forms the right SVC . The left anterior cardinal vein persists as the left SVC . A . Left superior vena cava draining into the right atrium by way of the coronary sinus B . Double superior vena cava.

        "D": "The primary villi have a core of extraembryonic mesoderm"
      },
      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: C) The tertiary villi have a mesoderm core that carries the fetal blood Explanation: The tertiary villi are formed with the extraembryonic mesoderm core filled with fetal blood, which establishes the fetoplacental circulation. The chorion is formed by the extraembryonic somatic mesoderm, cytotrophoblast, and syncytiotrophoblast. The chorionic villi formed from the chorion cover the chorionic sac (extraembryonic coelom) until the beginning of the 8th week. According to the structure of the chorionic villi at different periods of embryonic development they are divided into: Primary villi Secondary villi Tertiary villi A central core of cytotrophoblast (Option D) covered by a layer of syncytiotrophoblast. Intervillous space separates the villus from each other. Has 3 layers: Outer syncytiotrophoblast Intermediate cytotrophoblast Inner extraembryonic mesoderm (Option A) Similar to secondary villi but have fetal blood capillaries in the mesoderm Formation of the villi: Appearance of lacunae and trabeculae (around the 12th day of gestation): Small cavities appear in the rapidly growing and thick syncytiotrophoblast. These cavities are called lacunae and they increase in size and arrange themselves from irregular to a radial design around the blastocyst. The syncytium separates them from one another, forming partitions called trabeculae, which in time get surrounded by lacunae as they communicate with each other and one large space is formed. Erosion of maternal endometrium: The endometrium of the maternal uterus is eroded by the growing syncytiotrophoblasts, which leads to the opening of some blood vessels and the leaking of blood into the lacunar space (uteroplacental circulation). (Option B) Formation of chorionic villi: Once the cytotrophoblast grows into the trabeculae, it becomes a two-layered structure with a core of cytotrophoblast covered by a layer of syncytiotrophoblast and surrounded by maternal blood in the lacunar space. The trabeculae have now become the primary villi and the lacunar space, the intervillous space . When the extraembryonic mesoderm invades this primary villus and forms the core, this structure becomes the secondary villi, with the mesoderm core covered by cytotrophoblast and then the syncytiotrophoblast. Once the blood vessels fill the mesoderm, the tertiary villi are formed. The maternal blood runs in the intervillous space, and the fetal blood in the villi.",

        "D": "Cytotrophoblasts"
      },
      "correct_answer": "D",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: D) Cytotrophoblasts Explanation: The placental membrane or barrier separates the maternal and fetal blood in the intrauterine period but thins out towards the end of pregnancy for many reasons, one of which is the disappearance of the cytotrophoblast. Placenta has 2 parts (maternal and fetal), 2 surfaces (maternal and fetal), 2 types of cotyledons, and a peripheral margin. Maternal part is formed by the decidua basalis or decidual plate of the endometrium. Fetal part is from the chorion frondosum or chorionic plate. Maternal surface is rough and irregular having maternal cotyledons. Fetal surface is smooth and covered by amnion. Peripheral margin of the placenta presents the fetal membrane formed from decidua capsularis and pareitalis, chorion laeve and amnion.

      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: A) Trophoblast + Somatopleuric EEM Explanation: The structure marked “C” is Chorion , which is formed by the parietal (or somatopleuric) extraembryonic mesoderm and the trophoblast. Formation of extraembryonic mesoderm: Extra embryonic mesoderm, also called the primary mesoderm, is a mass of cells formed from the cells of the yolk sac cells (Hueser’s membrane) and lies outside the embryonic disc. This separates the endodermal layer covering the yolk sac and the trophoblast, as well as the wall of the amniotic cavity from the trophoblast. It does not form any tissues of the embryo. Formation of extraembryonic coelom: The extraembryonic mesoderm develops small cavities that later coalesce into one large cavity called the extraembryonic coelom (chorionic cavity), which divides the extraembryonic mesoderm into two layers. The layer between the amniotic cavity and the inside of the trophoblast is the parietal or somatopleuric extraembryonic mesoderm, and the layer outside the yolk sac is called the visceral or splanchnopleuric extraembryonic mesoderm. Formation of connecting stalk: The part of the extraembryonic mesoderm that keeps the amniotic sac, embryo, and yolk sac attached to the trophoblast, develops a structure called the connecting stalk . Formation of chorion and amnion: The parietal (or somatopleuric) extraembryonic mesoderm, cytotrophoblast and syncytiotrophoblast form a membrane called the chorion . The amniogenic cells of the walls of the amniotic cavity and the parietal extraembryonic mesoderm form the amnion . The amnion and chorion play a major role in childbirth .",

      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "disc. Correct Answer: B) It appears dorsally, becoming linear and marking the transition to a trilaminar disc. Explanation: The primitive streak is a key structure that forms on the dorsal aspect of the embryonic disc and becomes a linear structure as the disc elongates. This marks the beginning of gastrulation and the transition from a bilaminar to a trilaminar disc , establishing the embryonic axis . The primitive streak is an early, temporary structure that emerges in the blastula during the initial stages of embryonic development. Around the 15th day of development, following the formation of the prechordal plate, epiblast cells along the central axis near the tail end of the embryo start to proliferate, creating an elevation that protrudes into the amniotic cavity known as the primitive streak . (Option A, B and D) Its cranial end forms the primitive node. A groove called a primitive groove appears in the primitive streak, which continues with a small depression, a primitive pit , in the primitive node.

        "D": "Extraembryonic mesoderm"
      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: B) Intermediate mesoderm Explanation: Intermediate mesoderm is crucial for the development of the nephrogenic cord (which forms the urinary system) and the genital ridge (which forms the genital system). Abnormalities in this structure can result in both renal and gonadal defects. Intermediate Mesoderm: Lies between the paraxial mesoderm and the coelomic cavity in the lateral plate mesoderm before head folding. After the folding of the embryonic disc and formation of the peritoneal cavity, it forms a bulge on the posterior abdominal wall, known as the urogenital ridge. Urogenital Ridge: Covered by coelomic epithelium. Division: Genital Ridge: Medial part; gives rise to the genital system. Nephrogenic Cord: Lateral part; forms the urinary system and the adrenal cortex. Nephrogenic Cord: Extends from the cervical to the sacral region. Structures Formed: Excretory Renal Tubules: Para-, meso-, and metanephric tubules associated with kidney development. Nephric Duct: Initially forms in relation to the excretory tubules; later, it becomes the mesonephric duct. Adrenal Cortex : Forms from the mesoderm of the urogenital ridge, responsible for the development of the three layers of the adrenal cortex ( zona glomerulosa , zona fasciculata , zona reticularis ). Paramesonephric Duct: Forms lateral to the nephric duct. Gonad (Testis or Ovary): Develops from the coelomic epithelium lining the medial side of the nephrogenic cord. Paraxial mesoderm (Option A) forms somites that give rise to the axial skeleton, skeletal muscles, and dermis of the skin. It does not primarily contribute to kidney or gonadal development. Lateral plate mesoderm (Option C) contributes to the connective tissue of the body wall, limbs, and the visceral layers of the gut and circulatory system but does not directly form the kidneys or gonads. Extraembryonic mesoderm (Option D) supports embryonic development by forming structures like the yolk sac, allantois, and chorionic villi, which are essential for placental and early embryonic support but do not directly form the kidneys or reproductive organs.",

      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: B) 23 days Explanation: Somites begin forming around day 20 , and new somites form at a rate of approximately three pairs per day. By 23 days, an embryo typically has about 12 pairs of somites, making this the most likely developmental age. Somite Formation: First pair of somites arises in the occipital region at approximately the 20th day of development. Somites appear in a craniocaudal sequence at a rate of 3 pairs/day. At the end of the fifth week: 42 to 44 pairs of somites are present. Distribution: Occipital - 4, cervical - 8, thoracic - 12, lumbar - 5, sacral - 5, coccygeal - 8 to 10 The first occipital and last 5-7 coccygeal somites eventually disappear. Remaining Somites: Contribute to the formation of the axial skeleton. Clinical Application (Age Estimation): The age of an embryo can be accurately determined during this period by counting the number of somites.

Explanation: During gastrulation, epiblast cells migrate to form the primitive streak. This migration leads to the differentiation of epiblast cells into the three germ layers: endoderm, mesoderm, and ectoderm. Start of Process Formation of the primitive streak on the surface of the epiblast. Primitive Streak Initially indistinct, it becomes a narrow groove with bulging regions by days 15-16. Primitive Node Located at the cephalic end of the streak, a slightly raised area surrounding a small pit. Cell Migration Epiblast cells migrate toward the primitive streak and undergo invagination. Invagination Cells transform into flask-shaped forms, detach from the epiblast, and move beneath it. Regulation Fibroblast growth factor 8 (FGF8) regulates cell movement and mesoderm formation. FGF8 decreases E-cadherin levels, which helps in migration Cell Spread Invaginated cells replace the hypoblast and spread laterally and cranially. Contact with Extraembryonic Mesoderm Cells establish contact with the extraembryonic mesoderm covering the yolk sac and amnion. Prechordal Plate Forms between the notochord tip and the oropharyngeal membrane. Important for forebrain induction. Oropharyngeal Membrane Composed of tightly joined ectoderm and endoderm cells. Will become the future oral cavity opening. Formation of Germ Layers Endoderm : Displaces the hypoblast. Mesoderm : Forms between the epiblast and endoderm.
