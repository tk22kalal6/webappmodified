      "explanation": "Correct Answer: C) Cervical sympathetic trunk Explanation: Cervical sympathetic trunk is enclosed by the prevertebral fascia, which surrounds the vertebral column and associated structures. Prevertebral fascia/Lamina prevertebralis: Coronal extension from the internal aspect of the deep cervical fascia that runs anterior to the prevertebral muscles is called the Preethi layer of deep cervical fascia. Definition Thin layer of connective tissue that envelopes the prevertebral muscles and cervical sympathetic trunk. Location Anterior to the vertebral column, extending from the base of the skull to the superior mediastinum where it merges with the ligament of the vertebral column (T3/T4 level). Extension Axillary sheath: The cervical and brachial plexuses form from the nerves deep to the fascia, and as they extend, they pull the prevertebral fascia with them forming axillary sheath Functions Support to the vertebral column and associated muscles. Compartmentalization of various cervical structures which prevents infection spread Protective sheath to brachial plexus and subclavian vessels Clinical Significance Infection Spread: Particularly from the retropharyngeal space, which can lead to serious complications such as mediastinitis. Trapezius muscle (Option A): Enclosed by the investing layer of the deep cervical fascia, not the prevertebral fascia. Internal carotid artery (Option B): Contained within the carotid sheath, not the prevertebral fascia. Thyroid gland (Option D): Enclosed by the pretracheal fascia, not the prevertebral fascia.",

Infections in this space can easily spread to the mediastinum, leading to mediastinitis . Classification of Spaces: Suprahyoid spaces: Located above the hyoid bone, including the submandibular and prevertebral spaces. Infrahyoid spaces: Located below the hyoid bone, typically related to deeper neck structures. Suprahyoid spaces: Submental space Deep to upper investing layer of deep cervical fascia, superficial to mylohyoid muscles Submandibular space Deep to the concerned half of the mandible, between the anterior and posterior bellies of the digastric muscle Sublingual space Deep to mylohyoid muscles in the floor of the mouth, continuous with the opposite side Peritonsillar space Part of intrapharyngeal space, around palatine tonsils between pillars of fauces Parapharyngeal space On either side of the posterolateral aspect of pharynx Medially - superior constrictor of pharynx Laterally - medial pterygoid Retropharyngeal space Anteriorly - buccopharyngeal fascia of pharynx Posteriorly - prevertebral layer Laterally - carotid sheath Superiorly - cranial base Infrahyoid Spaces: Pretracheal space Behind pretracheal fascia and infrahyoid muscles, in front of the anterior wall of esophagus. Retrovisceral space Between the posterior wall of pharynx/esophagus and prevertebral fascia. Prevertebral space Between prevertebral fascia and vertebral column. Carotid space Around the contents of carotid sheath, demarcated by parts of investing, pretracheal, and prevertebral layers. Parapharyngeal space (Option A): While this space is adjacent to the pharynx and can be a site of infection, it does not communicate directly with the mediastinum. Carotid space (Option B): This space contains the carotid artery, internal jugular vein, and vagus nerve but is not typically involved in spreading infections to the mediastinum. Prevertebral space (Option D): Infections here can affect the vertebrae or muscles but are less likely to spread to the mediastinum compared to the retropharyngeal space.",
