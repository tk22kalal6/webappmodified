      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: C) The neck of the sperm contains centrioles. Explanation: The neck of the sperm contains centrioles, which play a crucial role in cell division and in forming the axoneme of the flagellum. Structure of Sperm Head Approximately 7 µm long with a flattened pear shape. Nucleus: Contains very condensed chromatin with areas of dispersed chromatin known as nuclear vacuoles. (Option D) Acrosomal Cap: Surrounds the anterior two-thirds of the nucleus; a membrane-bound vesicle containing glycoproteins and hydrolytic enzymes (e.g., hyaluronidase) that assist in fertilization by dissolving the zona pellucida. (Option B) Neck This is a short segment linking the head to the tail. Contain remnants of centrioles , one of which forms the axoneme of the flagellum. Often retains some cytoplasmic material in this region. Tail Divided into three parts: Middle piece, principal piece, and end piece. Middle Piece: Contains the flagellar axoneme surrounded by nine outer dense fibres and tightly packed elongated mitochondria arranged in a helix for energy. Principal Piece: Constitutes most of the tail's length; has a central core with axoneme and coarse fibres, surrounded by fibrous ribs arranged circularly. Features dorsal and ventral columns for potential propulsion during movement. (Option A) End Piece: Short tapering portion containing only the axoneme.

      },
      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: C) The ductuli efferentes carry sperm from the epididymis to the rete testis. Testis Anatomy Testis descends from the posterior peritoneal cavity wall to the scrotum during embryological development. Tunica Vaginalis: Testis is surrounded by a double layer of mesothelium (visceral and parietal layers), enclosing a potential space filled with serous fluid for lubrication. (Option A) Tunica Albuginea: Capsule of the testis, forms incomplete collagenous septa dividing the testis into ~250 lobules. Seminiferous Tubules: 1-4 convoluted tubes in each lobule, responsible for sperm production. (Option B) Rete Testis: Convergence point for seminiferous tubules. Ductuli Efferentes: 15-20 small ducts carry spermatozoa from the rete testis to the epididymis. Blood-Testis Barrier: The blood-testis barrier is formed by Sertoli cells, which are connected by junctional complexes, including extensive tight junctions located towards the basal layer of the spermatogenic epithelium. (Option D) This barrier divides the seminiferous tubule into two compartments: the basal and the adluminal compartments. The adluminal compartment contains spermatids, isolating them from the systemic circulation. The primary function of the blood-testis barrier is to protect developing gametes, which are antigenically different from somatic cells, from exposure to the immune system, thereby preventing an autoimmune response. Sertoli cells mediate all metabolic exchanges with the systemic compartment, ensuring the proper development of sperm. Reference: Wheater’s Functional Histology, 6th Edition, Page 338, 343.",

      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: B) Pseudostratified ciliated columnar epithelium with goblet cells Explanation: The epithelium responsible for mucociliary clearance in the upper respiratory tract is the respiratory epithelium. Respiratory epithelium The respiratory epithelium is predominantly composed of pseudostratified ciliated columnar epithelium with numerous goblet cells in the trachea and larger bronchi, which is essential for mucociliary clearance. This type of epithelium has the appearance of multiple layers due to the varying positions of nuclei, but all cells are in contact with the basement membrane, making it pseudostratified . Goblet cells : These cells are responsible for producing mucus, which traps particles, a critical component of the mucociliary clearance system. Cilia : Ciliated cells beat in a coordinated manner to propel mucus and trapped particles toward the pharynx, preventing the accumulation of foreign materials in the lower airways. The epithelial lining changes along the respiratory tract, becoming simpler (cuboidal or squamous) in the smaller airways and alveoli to facilitate gas exchange. Stratified squamous epithelium, non-keratinized (Option A): Found in areas subjected to mechanical stress, like the oropharynx, but lacks the cilia and goblet cells needed for mucociliary clearance. Simple cuboidal epithelium with Clara cells (Option C): Found in terminal bronchioles, where Clara cells secrete surfactant-like substances, but this epithelium is not responsible for the primary mucociliary clearance in the larger airways. Simple squamous epithelium with alveolar macrophages (Option D): Found in the alveoli, this epithelium is thin to facilitate gas exchange, while alveolar macrophages perform phagocytosis of debris. It does not participate in mucociliary clearance. Reference: Inderbir Singh Textbook of Human Histology, 9th Edition, Page 371, 372, 373.",

      "question": "A 30-year-old man presents with difficulty swallowing and a mild hoarse voice. Examination reveals no significant findings, and imaging shows no abnormal masses in the oropharynx. A biopsy is taken from a structure in the oropharynx that histologically shows a mixture of stratified squamous epithelium and pseudostratified columnar epithelium. This structure also contains seromucous glands and an elastic cartilage core. Which of the following structures is most likely biopsied?",

        "B": "Soft palate",
        "C": "Epiglottis",

      },
      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: C) Epiglottis Explanation: The structure biopsied in this scenario is the epiglottis. Histology of the Epiglottis: The epiglottis is a leaf-shaped structure that serves as a flap during swallowing, closing the laryngeal inlet to prevent food from entering the airway. Its upper surface is covered by stratified squamous epithelium (in the area exposed to mechanical wear from food), while the lower surface (facing the airway) has pseudostratified ciliated columnar epithelium (respiratory epithelium). The core of the epiglottis contains elastic cartilage , which provides flexibility and support. There are seromucous glands present, especially in the lamina propria, which help keep the surface moist. Epiglottis Histology of the Palate: The hard palate is lined by keratinized stratified squamous epithelium on its oral side, with a bony core. It lacks elastic cartilage and respiratory epithelium. (Option A) The soft palate has a surface of non-keratinized stratified squamous epithelium on the oral side, and pseudostratified columnar ciliated epithelium on the nasal side. Unlike the epiglottis, the core of the soft palate consists of skeletal muscle rather than cartilage. (Option B) Palate Vocal cords (Option D) : The true vocal cords are lined by stratified squamous epithelium , but they lack pseudostratified columnar epithelium and elastic cartilage. Instead, they have a ligamentous core (vocal ligament) and skeletal muscle (vocalis muscle).",

      },
      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer : A) Impaired electrical signal propagation between cardiac myocytes Explanation : Gap junctions, also called macula communicans, are specialized cell structures that facilitate direct communication between adjacent cells. They consist of channels formed by proteins called connexins, which allow ions, metabolites, and small molecules to pass between cells. Features of gap junctions: Connexons : Each channel is made of six connexin proteins that align between two cells to create a passage for substances like sodium, potassium, calcium, and small molecules. Electrical Communication : In tissues like cardiac and nerve cells, gap junctions enable rapid transmission of electrical impulses for synchronized function. Regulation : The channels can close in response to changes in pH or calcium levels, controlling the communication between cells. Distribution : Gap junctions are widely found in the body, playing a key role in lowering electrical resistance and supporting functions like electrical synapses in neurons Disruption of epithelial barrier function (Option B) : This is characteristic of defects in tight junctions (zonula occludens), which prevent paracellular leakage between epithelial cells. Tight junctions are unrelated to connexin proteins. Reduced mechanical stability between cells (Option C) : This describes the role of desmosomes , which provide structural integrity by linking intermediate filaments between cells. Desmosomes are crucial for mechanical stress resistance but have no role in direct cell communication. Abnormal attachment of muscle fibers to the extracellular matrix (Option D) : This refers to hemidesmosomes or integrins , which anchor cells to the basement membrane or extracellular matrix. These structures are involved in cell adhesion rather than communication through gap junctions.",

      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Hemidesmosome Correct Answer: B) A- Tight junction, B- Adherens junction, C- Desmosome, D- Gap junction, E- Hemidesmosome Explanation: Cell junctions are specialized membrane structures that connect adjacent cells or attach cells to the extracellular matrix. In epithelial cells, these junctions are organized in a specific pattern from the apical to the basal surface. At the apical region, the cell membranes fuse to form a tight junction (zonula occludens) , which encircles the cells. Below this is the zonula adherens , where proteins link to the cytoskeleton of both cells, separated by a small intercellular space with adhesion proteins. Further down is a desmosome , a spotlike structure with attachment proteins connecting the cells. The sequence of junctions from apical to basal is: Tight junctions (Zonula occludens) Adherens junctions (Zonula adherens) Desmosomes (Macula adherens) Gap junctions Hemidesmosomes Functions: Tight junctions (zonula occludens) : Found in epithelia of the stomach, intestines, and bladder, these prevent the passage of substances between cells by fusing membranes with claudin proteins. Zonula adherens : Links adjacent cells through cytoskeleton attachments, reinforced by actin filaments. Desmosomes : Seen in skin and cardiac muscle, they prevent cell separation under mechanical stress by anchoring to intermediate filaments. Hemidesmosomes : At the base of epithelial cells, anchoring them to the basement membrane and connective tissue. Gap junctions : Channels (connexons) between cells allowing molecular and electrical communication, crucial for cardiac muscle and nerve function.",
