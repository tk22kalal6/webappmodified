      "explanation": "Correct Answer: B) Over the ipsilateral shoulder Explanation: Pleura Structure and Function Visceral Pleura: Surrounds lung tissue. Composed of a single mesothelial cell layer. Blood supply from bronchial arteries. Parietal Pleura: Lines the inner chest wall. Contains stomata that drain pleural fluid into lymphatic capillaries. Connective tissue present; innervated by sensory nerve fibers. Pleural Fluid Normal Volume: 0.1 to 0.2 mL/kg. Inflow Rate: 0.5 mL/hr in adults. Maximal Removal Rate: 0.28 mL/kg/hr. Accumulates when inflow exceeds removal (due to increased plasma filtration or impaired lymphatic drainage). Lymphatic Drainage Lymph drains into regional lymph nodes along the sternum or vertebra, then into the thoracic and right lymphatic ducts. Lymphatic vessels are 10-12 µ m in diameter, large enough for intact erythrocytes. Innervation Visceral Pleura: No connective tissue; innervated by the vagus nerve, insensitive to pain. Parietal Pleura: Connective tissue; innervated by intercostal nerves and phrenic nerve. Phrenic Nerve: Predominantly innervates the central diaphragmatic region, referred pain to the ipsilateral shoulder. Pleural Membrane Function Allows frictionless movement of the lungs relative to the chest wall during respiration. Inspiration: Negative pressure in the pleural space leads to lung expansion, allowing air to enter the lungs Reference: Pain",

Level of the Thoracic Inlet : This is at the top of the thoracic cavity, where the trachea and esophagus enter. Level of the Aortic Arch : Located around the T4-T5 vertebral level, where the aorta arches over the left main bronchus. Level of the Carina : At the T5-T6 level, this is where the trachea bifurcates into the right and left main bronchi. Level of the Heart : The heart is typically seen from T6 to T9 . You can identify the chambers (right atrium, left atrium, ventricles) and major vessels (aorta, pulmonary arteries). Level of the Diaphragm : The diaphragm typically corresponds to the T10 vertebral level, which can help in distinguishing between thoracic and abdominal structures. Level of the Esophagus : The esophagus runs along the midline and can be seen at various levels, usually starting from the cervical region down to T10. Level of the Thoracic Spine : The thoracic vertebrae can be used as references; typically, there are 12 thoracic vertebrae. T1-T2 (Option A): This level generally shows the upper mediastinum, including parts of the great vessels, but the aortic arch is not typically prominent. T5-T6 (Option C): Here, the main bronchi are visible, but the aortic arch may not be well-defined.

      "explanation": "Correct Answer: B) Superior vena cava (SVC) obstruction Explanation: The presence of distended chest wall veins (collaterals) is highly indicative of increased venous pressure, commonly associated with superior vena cava (SVC) obstruction. In this case, the history of a mediastinal mass and metastasis suggests that the mass is compressing the SVC, leading to venous obstruction. This obstruction can cause the characteristic collateral circulation (distended chest wall veins) to develop, as the body attempts to reroute blood flow to bypass the obstruction. The illustration below shows signs of SVC obstruction Right heart failure (Option A) : While this can cause jugular distension, it typically does not lead to the development of prominent chest wall collaterals without",

Right Lymphatic Duct The right lymphatic duct may form from the convergence of the right jugular, subclavian, and bronchomediastinal trunks. These trunks drain lymph from the right side of the head and neck, the right upper limb, and the right side of the thorax. When present, the right lymphatic duct is approximately 0.5 inches (1.3 cm) long. It opens into the beginning of the right brachiocephalic vein.

      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: C) The superior hemiazygos vein drains into the azygos vein. Explanation: The superior hemiazygos vein drains into the azygos vein at the level of the seventh thoracic vertebra. Azygos Vein The origin of the azygos vein can vary, often starting from the union of the right ascending lumbar vein and the right subcostal vein in the abdomen. It ascends through the aortic opening in the diaphragm, on the right side of the aorta. The vein continues to rise until it reaches the level of the fifth thoracic vertebra. At this level, the azygos vein arches forward above the root of the right lung. It drains into the posterior surface of the superior vena cava. (Option A ruled out) Tributaries: The eight lower right intercostal veins The right superior intercostal vein The superior and inferior hemiazygos veins Mediastinal veins. Pericardial veins Right subcostal vein. Right bronchial vein. Right ascending lumbar vein. If there is an obstruction of the SVC, the azygos vein acts as the primary collateral pathway to redirect blood from the upper half of the body to the IVC. (Option D ruled out) Inferior Hemiazygos Vein The inferior hemiazygos vein is formed by the union of the left ascending lumbar vein and the left subcostal vein in the abdomen. It ascends through the left crus of the diaphragm and, around the level of the eighth thoracic vertebra, it turns to the right to join the azygos vein, receiving tributaries from the lower left intercostal and mediastinal veins. (Option B ruled out) Superior Hemiazygos Vein The superior hemiazygos vein is created by the union of the left superior intercostal vein and the fourth to eighth intercostal veins. It drains into the azygos vein at the level of the seventh thoracic vertebra.",

Phrenic Nerve The phrenic nerves contain both efferent (motor) and afferent (sensory) fibers . (Option A ruled out) The efferent fibers provide the sole motor supply to the diaphragm muscle. (Option B ruled out) The afferent fibers transmit sensory information to the central nervous system from the peritoneum covering the diaphragm's undersurface, the pleura on the diaphragm's upper surface, and the pericardium and mediastinal parietal pleura. Paralysis of the phrenic nerve may result from pressure from malignant tumors in the mediastinum.

      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: B) Junction of the azygos vein and superior vena cava Explanation: The sternal angle ( angle of Louis) is a palpable, transverse ridge on the sternum located approximately 5 cm below the suprasternal notch. It serves as a critical anatomical landmark for various significant structures and anatomical events. These include: The second costal cartilage articulates with the sternum at this level on both sides, making it a key reference point for counting ribs. It corresponds to the level of the intervertebral disc between the T4 and T5 vertebrae . A horizontal plane passing through this level divides the superior mediastinum from the inferior mediastinum . The arch of the aorta both begins and ends at this level. The trachea bifurcates into the right and left principal bronchus at this level. The pulmonary trunk divides into the right and left pulmonary arteries here. The upper border of the heart is located at this level. The azygos vein arches over the root of the right lung and empties into the superior vena cava at this level. (Option B) Left atrium of the heart (Option A) lies posteriorly and is located lower than the sternal angle, around the T6-T7 vertebral level. Origin of the thoracic duct (Option C) : is in the abdomen at the cisterna chyli , at the level of the L1-L2 vertebrae, far below the level of the sternal angle. Superior border of the aortic arch (Option D) : is located slightly above the level of the sternal angle, but its lower border (or the beginning and end of the arch) aligns with the T4-T5 level.",

      "correct_answer": "D",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: D) Pulmonary trunk Explanation: Pulmonary trunk is the content of middle mediastinum. Mediastinum: The mediastinum is an anatomical region between the two lungs in the thoracic cavity. Boundaries: Extends vertically from the thoracic inlet (superior thoracic aperture) to the diaphragm. Anterior - Sternum Posterior - Thoracic vertebral column The posterior boundary of the mediastinum is longer than the anterior because of the oblique alignment of the superior thoracic aperture and the posteroinferior curvature of the diaphragm. Laterally - mediastinal pleura, which are reflections of the parietal pleura. It is divided into superior and inferior mediastinum by the sternal plane which passes horizontally from the manubriosternal joint to T4 to T5 vertebra. Anatomical Divisions: 1. Superior Mediastinum: Located above the sternal angle (manubriosternal joint) Contains critical structures such as: Trachea and initial part of the bronchi Esophagus Great vessels: aortic arch, brachiocephalic trunk, left common carotid and subclavian arteries Thymus gland (or its remnants in adults) Various nerves: vagus, phrenic, and cardiac nerves, left RLN Lymph nodes Thoracic duct 2. Inferior Mediastinum: Located below the sternal angle and is further divided into anterior, middle, and posterior mediastinum. Anterior Mediastinum Middle Mediastinum Posterior Mediastinum Lies between the sternum and the pericardium Contains loose connective tissue, lymph nodes, and remnants of the thymus, sterno -pericardial ligaments. Provides surgical access to the heart and great vessels The broadest part of the inferior mediastinum Contains the heart enclosed in the pericardial sac Contains the roots of great vessels: ascending aorta, pulmonary trunk, and pulmonary veins, tracheal bifurcation and bronchi Includes the phrenic nerves and cardiac plexus Extends from the posterior pericardium to the vertebral column Contains important structures such as: (Option A, B, C) Descending thoracic aorta Esophagus Azygos and hemiazygos veins Thoracic duct Sympathetic trunks and splanchnic nerves Lymph nodes",

      },
      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: C) Posterior one-third of the interventricular septum Explanation: The coronary arteries supply blood to specific regions of the heart. The right coronary artery (RCA) typically supplies the right atrium , right ventricle , part of the left ventricle , and the posterior one-third of the interventricular septum in individuals with right-dominant coronary circulation. The posterior descending artery (PDA) branches from the RCA in the right-dominant hearts and supplies the posterior part of the heart. Coronary artery disease is a major cause of death worldwide. It is characterized by a reduced blood flow to the heart muscle (myocardium), depriving it of necessary oxygen. When a major coronary artery is suddenly blocked by an embolus (a plug or clot), the area of the heart muscle that relies on that artery for blood supply becomes ischemic. This lack of blood flow results in the death of the affected myocardial tissue due to necrosis. The 3 most common sites of coronary artery occlusion are: 1. Anterior IV (LAD) branch of the LCA (40–50%). 2. RCA (30–40%). 3. Circumflex branch of the LCA (15–20%). Coronary Artery Lesions Infarct Location Proximal LAD Large anterior wall More Distal LAD LAD (Wraparound) Anteroapical Inferior wall Distal LAD Anteroseptal Early Obtuse, Marginal High lateral wall More Distal Marginal Branch, Circumflex Small lateral wall Circumflex Posterolateral Distal RCA Small inferior wall Proximal RCA Large inferior and posterior wall RCA Right ventricular, usually inferior The anterior two-thirds of the interventricular septum and the apex of the heart (Options A and D) are supplied by the left anterior descending (LAD) artery, which is a branch of the left coronary artery (LCA). These regions would be affected by a blockage in the LAD, not the RCA. The lateral wall of the left ventricle (Option B) is primarily supplied by the left circumflex (LCX) artery, a branch of the left coronary artery (LCA), and not RCA.",
