      "explanation": "Correct Answer: D) L3 Explanation: The subcostal line corresponds to the L3 vertebrae. The subcostal plane refers to a horizontal (or transverse) plane which lies just below the level of the costal margin, i.e., connecting the 10th costal cartilages of right and left sides with each other. Posteriorly, the position of subcostal plane equates to the body of the third lumbar (L3) vertebrae. Reference: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK553104/#",
