      "question": "A 28 y/o football player experiences sudden pain on the inside of his left knee after getting tackled while running with the ball. He reports feeling a pop and is unable to continue playing. O/E, there is swelling, tenderness along the medial joint line, and pain when attempting to flex the knee. Which of the following injuries is most likely?",

        "D": "Posterior cruciate ligament (PCL) tear"
      },
      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: C) Medial meniscus tear Explanation: The mechanism of injury (sudden pain on the inside of the knee, feeling a pop, and tenderness along the medial joint line) is characteristic of a medial meniscus tear, which is often associated with twisting movements and trauma. Football Player Knee Injuries: Structures in the knee and injuries Cruciate Ligaments The anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) is more vulnerable than the posterior cruciate ligament (PCL) due to rotational forces in football. (Options B&D ruled out) Sudden direction changes can overstretch and tear the ACL. Collateral Ligaments (Lateral & medial) Less frequently injured but essential for side-to-side stability. (Option A ruled out) Side tackles (severe adduction or abduction) can strain these structures, leading to tears or sprains. Menisci Medial Meniscus is more prone to injury than the lateral meniscus. The medial meniscus attaches to the tibial collateral ligament- hence, it is more susceptible to tears from rotational forces. Bucket-handle tears are common in athletes and are characterised by longitudinal meniscus tears due to pivoting and twisting in a slightly flexed knee. Menisci",

      },
      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: C) 2, 3, 4 Explanation: Calcaneus: The calcaneus is the largest and strongest bone of the foot. It is situated below the talus and extends behind it. It is directed forward and laterally with an upward inclination. Anterior surface It is the smallest and bears a concavo-convex articular facet to articulate with cuboid. Posterior surface: It is divided into the following three parts: The upper one-third is smooth and related to a synovial bursa. The middle one-third provides attachment to tendocalcaneus and plantaris. Lower one-third is subcutaneous and weight bearing during standing posture Superior (dorsal) surface : It is divided into the following three areas: Posterior one-third (non-articular). Middle one-third (articular). Anterior one-third (partly articular and partly nonarticular). Plantar (inferior) surface: It is rough and marked by three tubercles. A small tubercle at the anterior end is called anterior tubercle. An elevation at its posterior end is called calcaneal tuberosity presenting a large medial and small lateral tubercles. The triangular area between the three tubercles provides attachment to the long plantar ligament. A groove in front of the anterior tubercle gives attachment to short plantar ligament Lateral surface It is almost flat and subcutaneous. It presents a small elevation in its anterior part called peroneal trochlea (tubercle) which lies 2 cm below the tip of lateral malleolus. Medial surface : It is concave from above downward A shelf-like projection called sustentaculum tali projects from its upper anterior part. (Statement 1) The superior surface of sustentaculum tali bears a facet for talus (Statement 2) while its inferior surface bears a groove for the tendon of flexor hallucis longus. (Statement 3) Tendon of flexor digitorum longus is related to the medial surface of sustentaculum tali. Medial surface of sustentaculum tali provides attachments to the following structures from anterior to posterior (Statement 4) : (a) Spring ligament. (b) A slip from the tibialis posterior tendon. (c) Deltoid ligament (superficial fibres). (d) Medial talocalcaneal ligament. Reference: Reference: Vishram Singhâ€™s Textbook of Anatomy, 2nd Edition, Volume 2, Pages 322-324",

      "question": "Which statement best describes the relationship of the tibial nerve in the popliteal fossa?",
      "options": {
        "A": "It is the most medial structure crossing to the lateral side of the fossa.",
        "B": "It is deep to the popliteal artery and vein.",
        "C": "It lies lateral to the popliteal vessels crossing to the medial side.",
        "D": "It does not enter the popliteal fossa."
      },
      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: C) It lies lateral to the popliteal vessels crossing to the medial side. Explanation: In the popliteal fossa, the tibial nerve is positioned laterally to the popliteal artery and vein. As it continues its course, it crosses to the medial side of the popliteal artery, becoming more superficial as it descends. Tibial Nerve Origin and Course: The tibial nerve, a major branch of the sciatic nerve, originates from the ventral branches of the fourth and fifth lumbar and first to third sacral rami. It travels down the back of the thigh, enters the popliteal fossa, and passes anterior to the soleus arch, continuing into the leg. In the popliteal fossa, it becomes superficial and is lateral to the popliteal vessels, eventually crossing to the medial side of the popliteal artery. (Option A, B & D ruled out) In the leg, it descends with the posterior tibial vessels, lying on the tibialis posterior and bifurcating under the flexor retinaculum into the medial and lateral plantar nerves. Branches: Articular Branches: Supply the knee joint. Muscular Branches: Innervate gastrocnemius, soleus, plantaris, popliteus, tibialis posterior, flexor digitorum longus, and flexor hallucis longus. Sural Nerve: Descends between gastrocnemius heads, supplying the posterior and lateral skin of the distal leg and foot. Medial and Lateral Plantar Nerves: Innervate the muscles and skin of the sole. Medial Calcaneal Nerve: Supplies sensation to the heel area. Tibial Nerve Clinical Significance: The tibial nerve is prone to injury in the popliteal fossa and can be compressed at the tendinous arch of the soleus, leading to potential damage from compartment syndrome or tarsal tunnel syndrome.",

      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: B) Supination Explanation: The described movement involves supination , a tri-planar motion that includes adduction, inversion, and plantar flexion , resulting in an elevated medial arch and a more rigid foot. This is commonly seen when standing or walking on uneven surfaces, such as a rock, where stability is needed. Supination: A tri-planar motion involving: Adduction Inversion Plantar flexion Occurs mainly at the talocalcaneonavicular and subtalar joints . Common in activities like standing with feet widely separated or standing on an inclined surface. The medial arch is elevated in supination, making the foot more rigid and stable. Pronation: The opposite tri-planar motion involves: Abduction Eversion (Option C ruled out) Dorsiflexion (Option D ruled out) It helps adapt the foot to uneven surfaces by making it more pliable. It occurs more when standing with feet close together. (Option A ruled out) Pronation flattens the medial longitudinal arch, spreading forces over a broader area of the foot. Supination and Pronation Combination Movements: Both supination and pronation involve multiple movements and rarely occur in isolation. They allow the foot to adapt to different terrains and provide a balance between stability and flexibility during standing and movement. Reference:",

      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: B) Fibularis Longus Explanation: The Fibularis Longus muscle is one of the primary movers for foot eversion and supports the arches of the foot. The lateral compartment of the leg Muscles Fibularis Longus Fibularis Brevis Attachment Origin: Head and proximal two-thirds of the fibula, deep fascia, intermuscular septa, and sometimes the lateral condyle of the tibia. Insertion: Base of the first metatarsal and medial cuneiform. Origin: Distal two-thirds of the fibula, intermuscular septa. Insertion: Tuberosity on the base of the fifth metatarsal. Action Eversion of foot Plantar flexion of the ankle Supports longitudinal and transverse arches of foot Eversion of foot Limits inversion, relieving strain on lateral ankle ligaments Innervation Superficial fibular nerve (L5, S1) Superficial fibular nerve (L5, S1) Clinical aspects Risk of tendon dislocation if fibular retinaculum ruptures Limits inversion, relieving strain on lateral ankle ligaments. Lateral Compartment of Leg Muscles Anterior and Lateral Compartment of Leg Tibialis Anterior (Option A): This muscle is primarily responsible for dorsiflexion and inversion, not eversion. Fibularis Brevis (Option C): While it causes eversion, it mainly inserts at the base of the fifth metatarsal and is less involved in the general eversion action compared to Fibularis Longus. Gastrocnemius (Option D): This muscle primarily acts in plantarflexion and does not contribute to foot eversion.",

      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: B) Extensor Hallucis Longus Explanation: The patient presents with difficulty in dorsiflexing the foot and weakness in extending the big toe, which is primarily the function of the extensor hallucis longus. Anterior compartment of the leg Muscles Attachments Innervation Action Clinical aspects Tibialis Anterior Lateral condyle, proximal 1/2-2/3 lateral tibial shaft, interosseous membrane. Inserts onto medial cuneiform and base of 1st metatarsal. Deep fibular nerve (L4, L5) Dorsiflexes foot Inverts foot Supports medial arch Weakness: foot drop Can cause shin splints. Extensor Hallucis Longus The middle half of the medial fibula and interosseous membrane. Inserts onto the dorsal base of the distal phalanx of the hallux. Deep fibular nerve (L5) Extends hallux Dorsiflexes foot Weakness: Difficulty extending the big toe. Extensor Digitorum Longus Lateral tibial condyle, proximal 3/4 medial fibula, interosseous membrane. Tendons insert onto middle and distal phalanges of lateral 4 toes.

Tibialis Anterior (Option A): While it contributes to dorsiflexion, the primary symptom of difficulty extending the big toe suggests the involvement of extensor hallucis longus. Extensor Digitorum Longus (Option C): Although it extends the lateral toes, it does not directly affect the movements of the big toe. Fibularis Tertius (Option D): This muscle aids in dorsiflexion and eversion but is less likely to cause difficulty in extending the big toe specifically. Reference:",

The fibrous capsule is made up of outer fibres which are longitudinal and inner circular fibres which are called zona orbicularis. Ligamentum teres femoris transmits the arteries to the head of femur. IIiofemoral ligament is inverted Y shaped ligament. The acetabular labrum helps in holding the femur in position.",

      },
      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: A) 1,2,3,4 Explanation: The ligaments of the hip joint are as follows: Capsular ligament (joint capsule). Iliofemoral ligament (strongest). Pubofemoral ligament. Ischiofemoral ligament. Transverse acetabular ligament. Acetabular labrum. Ligamentum teres femoris (round ligament of the head of femur). 1. The capsular ligament is a strong and dense fibrous sac which encloses the joint. The capsule is made up of two types of fibresâ€”inner circular fibres and outer longitudinal fibres. The inner circular fibres form a collar around the femoral neck ( zona orbicularis ). These fibres are not directly attached to the bones (Statement 1) The outer longitudinal fibres are reflected along the neck toward the head to form the retinacula. 2. The iliofemoral ligament is an inverted Y-shaped ligament, which lies anteriorly and intimately blended with the capsule.(Statement 3) This ligament consists of three parts: a lateral thick band of oblique fibres,a medial thick band of vertical fibres, and a large central thin portion Iliofemoral ligament is the strongest ligament of body and prevents the trunk from falling backward in the standing posture 3. The pubofemoral ligament is a triangular ligament with base above and apex below 4. The ischiofemoral ligament is relatively weak and supports the capsule posteriorly 5. Round ligament of head of femur : This ligament is also called ligamentum teres of the head of the femur. It is a flat triangular ligament with apex attached to the fovea of the head, and its base to the transverse acetabular ligament It is ensheathed by a conical reflection of the synovial membrane. It does not increase the stability of the joint. It transmits arteries to the head of the femur derived from the acetabular branches of the obturator and medial circumflex femoral arteries.(Statement 2) Morphologically, the ligament of the head of femur represents the part of capsule that has been included within the joint 6. The acetabular labrum is a fibrocartilaginous rim attached to the acetabular margin. The labrum not only deepens the acetabulum (socket) but grasps the head of femur lightly to hold it in position.(Statement 4) 7. Transverse acetabular ligament : It is a part of acetabular labrum, which bridges the acetabular notch; however, it is devoid of cartilage cells. The acetabular notch thus becomes converted into the foramen which transmits the acetabular vessels and nerves to the hip joint.

      },
      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: A) Prepatellar bursitis. Explanation: Prepatalar bursitis also known as Housemaidâ€™s knee is the inflammation of the prepatellar bursa (prepatellar bursitis). It occurs due to friction of bursa against the patella when it comes in contact with the ground during scrubbing of the floor by the housemaid. Such a bursa may get very large and drop by its weight too much below to its original position. Subcutaneous prepatellar bursa (bursa of housemaidâ€™s knee). It lies deep to the skin in front of the lower half of the patella and upper half of the ligamentum patellae and tibial tuberosity. Bakerâ€™s cyst (Option B) : The chronic inflammation of bursa deep to semimembranosus may present as cystic swelling in the medial part of the popliteal fossa called Bakerâ€™s cyst Osteoarthritis of the knee (Option C) : This is unlikely given the patient's relatively young age and the acute nature of the symptoms. Osteoarthritis typically presents with chronic pain, stiffness, and decreased range of motion in older individuals, especially those over the age of 50. The swelling in osteoarthritis is also typically associated with joint degeneration rather than soft, fluctuant swelling in the prepatellar region. Clergymanâ€™s knee (Option D) : It is the inflammation of subcutaneous infrapatellar bursa (subcutaneous infrapatellar bursitis). It occurs due to the friction of bursa against the tibial tuberosity due to kneeling (e.g., kneeling during prayer by Christian priests/clergymen, roofers, and floor tilers.

The sciatic nerve originates from the ventral rami of the L4â€“S3 spinal roots. Sciatic Nerve Origin and Course The thickest nerve in the body. Arises from the ventral rami of L4â€“S3 spinal nerves. (Option A, C & D ruled out) Exits the pelvis through the greater sciatic foramen below the piriformis and descends between the greater trochanter and ischial tuberosity along the back of the thigh. Divides into the tibial and common peroneal nerves above the popliteal fossa. Distribution Motor: Undivided Trunk: Supplies all muscles of the back of the thigh (hip extension, knee flexion). Tibial Nerve: Innervates leg muscles (flexion) and foot muscles (plantar flexion). Common Peroneal Nerve: Supplies leg muscles (dorsiflexion). Sensory: Tibial Nerve: Supplies skin on the back of the calf, heel, lateral border of the foot, and sole. Common Peroneal Nerve: Supplies skin on the anterolateral and lateral surfaces of the leg and dorsum of the foot (except for the deep peroneal nerve area). Clinical correlation Injury of the sciatic nerve: Causes: Penetrating wounds, posterior hip dislocation, pelvic fractures, total hip replacement, misplaced injections in the gluteal region. Clinical Features: Inability to extend the thigh and flex the knee (hamstring paralysis). Loss of all movements below the knee (foot drop) leading to flail foot and high-stepping gait. Loss of sensation on the back of the thigh, entire leg, and foot (except for the saphenous nerve area). Sciatica: Shooting pain along the sciatic nerve distribution (buttock, posterior thigh, lateral leg, dorsum of the foot). Compression/irritation of L4â€“S3 spinal nerve roots due to herniated lumbar discs. Neuropathy: Entrapment in the piriformis muscle can lead to piriformis syndrome.

Superficial group of muscles Muscles Attachments Action Nerve Clinical aspects Gastrocnemius Origin : Medial and lateral condyles of the femur Insertion :Calcaneal tendon Plantar flexion of the foot Flexion of knee Tibial nerve (S1, S2) Testing: Plantar flexion against resistance (knee extended). Soleus Origin : Posterior head and proximal fibula, soleal line of tibia, tendinous arch of soleus Insertion : Calcaneal tendon Primary plantar flexor Stabilizes leg during standing Tibial nerve (S1, S2) Testing: Plantar flexion against resistance (hip and knee flexed). Plantaris Origin : Lower part of the lateral supracondylar line on the femur, oblique popliteal ligament Insertion : Calcaneus (medial to calcaneal tendon) Assists gastrocnemius in plantar flexion (less significant) Tibial nerve Minor role in foot mechanics. Superficial group of muscles Dissection image of Superficial Structures Deep group of muscles Muscles Attachments Action Nerve Clinical aspects Popliteus Origin: Lateral femoral condyle Insertion: Posterior surface of tibia above the soleal line Unlocks the knee by laterally rotating the femur on the tibia Tibial nerve (L4, L5, S1,) Injury may lead to knee instability Important in knee biomechanics. Flexor Digitorum Longus Origin: Posterior surface of the tibia (medial to tibialis posterior) Insertion: Plantar surfaces of distal phalanges of toes 2-5 Plantar flexion of the ankle Flexion of the distal phalanges of toes 2-5 Tibial nerve (L5, S1, S2) The aberrant function may contribute to toe deformities (e.g., hammer toe). Flexor Hallucis Longus Origin: Distal two-thirds of the posterior fibula, interosseus membrane. Insertion: Plantar surface of the base of the distal phalanx of the hallux Plantar flexion of the ankle Flexion of the hallux Tibial nerve (L5, S1, S2) Overuse in dancers may lead to tendinopathy (e.g., hallux saltans). Important surgical landmark at the ankle to avoid neurovascular injury. Tibialis Posterior Origin: Interosseous membrane, posterior surface of tibia, fibula Insertion: Navicular tuberosity, cuneiforms, bases of metatarsals 2-4 The principal inverter of the foot Supports medial longitudinal arch Tibial nerve (L4, L5) Dysfunction can lead to a flat foot (pes planus) due to tendon elongation and attenuation of the spring ligament.

      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: B) Lateral condyle of femur; Tibial nerve Explanation: The popliteus muscle originates from the anterior part of the popliteal groove on the lateral condyle of the femur and is supplied by a branch of the tibial nerve (L4, L5, S1). Popliteus Muscle Popliteus Muscle Origin Arises within the knee joint capsule from the anterior part of the popliteal groove located on the lateral condyle of the femur. Insertion The medial aspect of the head of the fibula via the popliteofibular ligament Medial two-thirds of the triangular area above the soleal line on the posterior surface of the tibia. Blood supply Inferior medial and lateral genicular arteries Posterior tibial artery and its branches. Nerve supply The branch of the tibial nerve (L4, L5, S1) . Actions Medially rotates the tibia on the femur; when the tibia is fixed, it laterally rotates the femur. It is the \"unlocking\" muscle of the knee by unlocking the locked knee by rotating the femur laterally during the initial stages of knee flexion. It pulls the lateral meniscus posteriorly, preventing it from becoming trapped and compressed between the femoral and tibial condyles. Options A, C, and D are incorrect because the popliteus muscle originates from the lateral condyle of the femur , not the medial condyle, the tibial tuberosity or the fibular head, respectively, and it is innervated by the tibial nerve , not the femoral nerve, sciatic nerve, or peroneal nerve respectively.",

      "explanation": "Correct Answer: D) PCL prevents anterior displacement of the femur. Explanation: The PCL prevents anterior displacement of the femur and posterior displacement of the tibia when the knee is flexed, making it essential for knee stability. Extracapsular Ligaments Intracapsular Ligaments Ligamentum Patellae: Attaches from the lower border of the patella to the tibial tuberosity. Continuation of the quadriceps femoris tendon. Lateral (Fibular) Collateral Ligament: (Option B ruled out) Cord-like structure attaching from the femur's lateral condyle to the fibula's head. The Popliteus tendon is located between this ligament and the lateral meniscus. Medial (Tibial) Collateral Ligament: Flat band connecting the medial condyle of the femur to the medial surface of the tibia. Firmly attached to the medial meniscus. Oblique Popliteal Ligament: Tendinous expansion from the semimembranosus muscle, strengthening the posterior capsule. Medial Meniscus Semicircular, wider posteriorly than anteriorly. (Option C ruled out) The peripheral margin adheres to the deep part of the tibial collateral ligament; posterior fibres are continuous with the transverse ligament. Lateral Meniscus Circular. The posterior end is attached to the medial condyle of the femur via two meniscofemoral ligaments; separated from the fibular collateral ligament by the popliteus tendon. Anterior Cruciate Ligament (ACL): (Option A ruled out) It attaches to the anterior intercondylar area of the tibia and ascends to the posterior part of the lateral femoral condyle.

      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: B) Quadriceps femoris for locking and popliteus for unlocking Explanation: The quadriceps femoris muscle group extends the knee and helps in the locking mechanism when the knee is fully extended. The popliteus muscle is responsible for unlocking the knee by initiating flexion, particularly from a fully extended position. Aspect Locking of the Knee Joint Unlocking of the Knee Joint Movement When the foot is on the ground - the medial rotation of the femur on the tibia is locking. When the foot is on the ground lateral rotation of the femur on the tibia is unlocking. Phase of Motion Terminal phase of extension. Initial phase of flexion. Muscle Involved (Option A, C & D) Quadriceps femoris Popliteus muscle Knee Rigidity The locked knee becomes rigid. An unlocked knee can be further flexed. Ligament Tension All ligaments are taut. All ligaments are relaxed. Function Essential for bearing load during erect posture. Facilitates the progress of locomotion. Locking and Unlocking Mechanism of the Knee (Non-Weight-Bearing) Locking (Screw-Home Mechanism): During knee extension, the tibia medially rotates relative to the femur, tightening ligaments (e.g., ACL) and stabilising the joint. Unlocking: The popliteus muscle initiates knee flexion by laterally rotating the tibia, loosening the ligaments and allowing movement. This mechanism ensures stability during transitions and controlled movement when the foot is not planted.
