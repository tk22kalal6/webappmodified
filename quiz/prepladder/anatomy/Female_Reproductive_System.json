      "explanation": "Correct Answer: C) Transitional zone Explanation : The above mentioned condition is benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) and the transitional zone is primarily responsible for it. Prostate Zones Description Peripheral Zone Extends posterolaterally around the gland from the apex to the base. Represents the most common site in the prostate for developing prostate carcinomas. Transitional Zone Constitutes two small lobules around the prostatic urethra. Represent the region where benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) primarily originates.

      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: C) Benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) Explanation: Patient’s symptoms of increased urinary frequency, nocturia, and difficulty initiating urination, along with the finding of an enlarged prostate, are classic signs of benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH). Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia (BPH): Non-malignant enlargement or hyperplasia of the prostate tissue. Common in older men , particularly those over 50 and prevalence increases with age. Hyperplasia results from impaired cell death , resulting in the accumulation of senescent cells in the prostate. Pathophysiology Hormonal changes (increased dihydrotestosterone, DHT) contribute to prostate growth. Proliferation of stromal and epithelial cells, and delayed epithelial cell death in the transitional zone. Risk factors Diabetes mellitus Obesity Metabolic syndrome Heavy caffeine consumption High dose supplemental vitamin-C 1st degree relatives Symptoms Storage Symptoms: Urinary frequency Urgency Nocturia Incontinence (Urgency, stress) Voiding Symptoms: Hesitancy Small stream Intermittency Terminal dribbling Urinary retention Diagnosis Digital rectal exam (DRE) reveals enlarged prostate. Urinalysis to rule out infection. Prostate-specific antigen (PSA) test to assess for prostate cancer. Urinary flow rate tests can evaluate the severity of obstruction. 24 hour voiding diary Urodynamics Complications Acute urinary retention Urinary tract infections Bladder stones Kidney damage (if untreated) Treatment Alpha-blockers ( tamsulosin ), 5-alpha reductase inhibitors ( finasteride ). Transurethral resection of the prostate (TURP) Transurethral incision of the prostate Transurethral electrovaporization Holmium and Thulium laser enucleation of the prostate Prostate cancer (Option A) presents similarly but would typically require further evaluation and would more likely present with nodularity or firmness rather than a smooth enlarged prostate. Prostatitis (Option B) causes urinary symptoms but usually associated with pain, fever or dysuria. Urinary tract infection (Option D) causes urinary frequency and urgency but would usually be associated with other symptoms like dysuria or fever.",

      "explanation": "ducts. Correct Answer: C) It connects the bladder to the membranous urethra and receives the ejaculatory ducts. Explanation: Male Urethra is Divided into 4 Parts: Pre-prostatic urethra Prostatic urethra Membranous urethra Spongy urethra Prostatic Urethra: Segment of the male urethra that passes through the prostate gland. Location Widest part of male urethra. (Option B) Contains urethral crest, seminal colliculus, prostatic utricle and orifices of prostatic duct. Extends from the bladder neck to the beginning of the membranous urethra which is approximately 3-4 cm in length . (Option C) Histology Urothelium immediately surrounded by glandular and strong tissue of the periurethral zone of the prostate. (Option A) Functions Conducts urine from the bladder to the external urethral orifice and serves as a passage for semen during ejaculation. (Option D) Associated Structures Receives the ejaculatory ducts , which deliver semen from the seminal vesicles and the vas deferens and contains the prostatic urethral orifices, which allow for the secretion of prostatic fluid. Clinical Significance Can be affected by conditions such as benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) and prostate cancer , leading to urinary obstruction. Digital rectal examination (DRE) can assess the prostate’s condition via the prostatic urethra. Reference: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK542238/",

      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "→ Membranous urethra → Spongy urethra Correct Answer: A) Prostatic urethra → Membranous urethra → Spongy urethra Explanation: The correct order of the segments of the male urethra is Prostatic urethra → Membranous urethra → Spongy urethra Male Urethra: Urethra is a dynamic fibromuscular tube which serves as the terminal region of the male urinary and reproductive systems. Average male urethra is 20 cm long and begins within the bladder wall and ends in the distal glans of the penis. Receives blood supply from the inferior vesical artery , bulbourethral artery , and the internal pudendal artery. The sympathetic, parasympathetic and visceral innervation to the male urethra gets delivered through the prostatic plexus. Littre’s glands are small mucous-secreting glands located in the submucosa, along the length of male urethra, primarily in the spongy urethra. Divided into 4 parts: Pre-Prostatic Urethra Location : Extends inferiorly from urinary bladder and ends prior to entering the prostate gland. Gross Features : It is embedded within the walls of the urinary bladder and is typically 0.5 to 1.5 cm in length. Histological Features : Transitional epithelium (urothelium) Prostatic Urethra Location : Completely encompassed within the prostate gland. Gross Features : This is generally the widest part of the male urethra, and contains the urethral crest, seminal colliculus, prostatic utricle, and the orifices of the prostatic ducts - typically 3.0 to 4.0 cm in length. Histological Features : Urothelium immediately surrounded by the glandular and stromal tissue of the periurethral zone of the prostate. Membranous Urethra Location : Begins immediately outside of the prostate and ends just prior to entering the bulb of the penis. Gross Features : Passes through the deep perineal pouch, the external urethral sphincter, and the perineal membrane.Typically 1 to 1.5 cm in length. Histological Features: Pseudostratified columnar epithelium. Spongy Urethra/Penile Urethra Location : Travels the entire length of the penis via the corpus spongiosum. Gross Features: Widens initially as it enters the bulb of the penis and widens again in the glans of the penis, forming the navicular fossa.Typically around 15 cm in length. Histological Features : Pseudostratified columnar epithelium except for the terminal portion which is stratified squamous epithelium.",

        "D": "Urethra, as it lies inferior to uterine artery"
      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Correct answer: B) Ureter, as it lies posterior to uterine artery Explanation: While performing uterine artery ligation, ‘ water under bridge ’ can occur due to injury to Ureter . ‘Water’ refers to urine, due to leak from the ureter and ‘bridge’ is formed by the uterine artery. Ureter lies posteroinferior to the uterine artery. Relations of Arteries with Ureter: Uterine artery is a branch of anterior division of internal iliac artery and ovarian artery is a branch of abdominal aorta , both of which anastomose. Uterine artery is anterosuperior to the ureter by 2.5 cm and then crosses the ureter to ascend along the lateral side of the uterus. Ureter passes forward, just above the lateral fornix of the vagina, and lies about 2 cm to the side of the supravaginal portion of the cervix. It then curves inward toward the urinary bladder, coming into close contact with the vagina. While performing hysterectomy, careful ligation of the uterine artery should be done to prevent this. Presence of peristaltic movements and the pale glistening appearance with firm cord feel on palpation will help in identifying the ureter. Mesenteries Supporting Female Reproductive System: Broad ligament Fold of peritoneum attaching uterus to the lateral pelvic wall Mesovarium Attaches ovary to the posterior layer of broad ligament Mesometrium Part of broad ligament lying between uterine tube and ovarian ligament ( Ovarian ligament: passes from lower pole of ovary to lateral angle of uterus) Suspensory Ligament of the Ovary Part of the broad ligament that stretches from the upper pole of the ovary and the infundibulum of the uterine tube to the lateral pelvic wall Also known as infundibulopelvic ligament",
