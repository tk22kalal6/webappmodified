Annexin A1 is a protein specifically expressed on the surface of hairy cells in Hairy Cell Leukemia. It is characterized by a distinctive genetic mutation (BRAF V600E in >90% of cases) and expression of specific B-cell markers Clinical presentation include persistent fatigue, splenomegaly, and pancytopenia and increased susceptibility to infections.. Peripheral smear shows Leukocytosis with mature lymphocytes displaying hairy projections.

CD20 (Option A) is a surface marker present on most B cells and is commonly expressed in a variety of B-cell lymphomas and leukemias. While CD20 can be positive, it is not specific to HCL and is found in many other B-cell neoplasms. Annexin A5 (Option B) is a protein involved in the cellular processes related to apoptosis and phospholipid binding. It is used as a marker to detect apoptotic cells.

      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: A) MYC gene Explanation: The clinical presentation with mandibular mass and a starry sky appearance on HPE are characteristic of Burkitt’s lymphoma, which is associated with the translocation of the MYC gene on chromosome 8, thus leading to overexpression of the MYC protein. All forms of Burkitt’s lymphoma (Endemic, Sporadic and HIV associated) are associated with such translocations. The most common translocations are t (8:2), t(8:14), and t(8:22). BCL2 gene (Option B) translocation is associated with follicular lymphoma. The most common is t(14;18), leading to the juxtaposition of the IGH locus (Ch 14) with the BCL2 locus(Ch 18), leading to overexpression of BCL2. Cyclin-D1 (Option C) gene translocation is associated with all mantle cell lymphoma. There is a translocation of the cyclin D1 locus on chromosome 11 and IGH locus on chromosome 14; t(11;14), which results in overexpression of cyclin D1, thus promoting G1 to S-phase progression in the cell cycle. BCL6 gene (Option D) dysregulation is associated with Diffuse large B cell lymphoma. It can",

The cellular environment is typically rich in fibrosis or necrosis. Immunophenotype: The RS cells in LDHL are usually positive for CD15 and CD30 but negative for CD20. Clinical Presentation: systemic symptoms such as fever, night sweats, and significant weight loss referred to as \"B symptoms.” Epidemiology: LDHL is the least common subtype of Hodgkin lymphoma and is more frequently diagnosed in older adults and individuals with HIV infection. Prognosis: LDHL is associated with a poorer prognosis compared to other Hodgkin lymphoma subtypes due to its more aggressive nature Treatment: Treatment typically involves a combination of chemotherapy and, in some cases, radiation therapy.. Presence of fibrous bands (Option A) it is characteristic of nodular sclerosis Hodgkin's lymphoma, not LDHL. Nodular sclerosis is marked by the presence of fibrous bands that divide the lymph node into nodules. Abundance of reactive lymphocytes (Option B) it is typical of lymphocyte-rich Hodgkin's lymphoma, a subtype characterised by an abundance of small, reactive lymphocytes and relatively few Reed-Sternberg cells.

      "explanation": "Correct Answer: C) Lymphocyte-rich Hodgkin lymphoma Explanation: Lymphocyte-rich Hodgkin lymphoma: Histological Features: Lymphocyte-rich Hodgkin lymphoma is characterised by a predominance of reactive lymphocytes with relatively few Reed-Sternberg (RS) cells. Immunophenotype: The RS cells in lymphocyte-rich Hodgkin lymphoma are typically positive for CD20 and negative for CD15 and CD30 , distinguishing it from other subtypes of Hodgkin lymphoma. Clinical Presentation: Patients often present with painless lymphadenopathy, commonly in peripheral lymph nodes rather than mediastinal involvement. Prognosis: This subtype generally has a favourable prognosis compared to other types of Hodgkin lymphoma due to its lower aggressiveness and higher responsiveness to treatment. Nodular sclerosis Hodgkin lymphoma (Option A) is the most common subtype, characterised by the presence of lacunar Reed-Sternberg cells and fibrous bands that divide the lymphoid tissue into nodules. These cells are usually positive for CD15 and CD30 but negative for CD20. Mixed cellularity Hodgkin lymphoma (Option B) features a heterogeneous mixture of cells, including Reed-Sternberg cells, lymphocytes, eosinophils, neutrophils, and plasma cells. These cells are typically CD15 and CD30 positive but negative for CD20. Lymphocyte-depleted Hodgkin lymphoma (Option D) is the least common subtype and is characterised by a paucity of lymphocytes and a high number of pleomorphic, often bizarre Reed-Sternberg cells. These cells are usually CD15 and CD30 positive but negative for CD20 and associated with a poorer prognosis",

      "correct_answer": "D",
      "explanation": "lymphoma. Correct Answer: D) It is usually associated with a better prognosis than other subtypes of Hodgkin’s lymphoma. Explanation: Mixed Cellularity Hodgkin’s Lymphoma often presents at an advanced stage (III or IV), which is generally associated with a worse prognosis compared to the Nodular Sclerosis subtype, which typically presents at an earlier stage (I or II) and has a relatively better prognosis. Mixed-Cellularity Hodgkin Lymphoma (MCHL) accounts for 20% to 25% of cases and features lymph nodes diffusely effaced by a heterogeneous cellular infiltrate, including T cells, eosinophils, plasma cells, and macrophages, along with abundant Reed-Sternberg and mononuclear variants. (Option A) Approximately 70% of Reed-Sternberg cells are EBV-positive. (Option B) RS cells are CD15+, CD30+ (Option C) MCHL is more prevalent in males and is more likely to be associated with systemic symptoms such as night sweats and weight loss.

      "explanation": "Correct Answer: A) Nodular Sclerosis Classical Hodgkin Lymphoma Explanation: The given clinical scenario points towards diagnosing Nodular Sclerosis type of Classical Hodgkin Lymphoma which features characteristic Lacunar variant Reed-Sternberg cells and collagen deposition in lymph nodes. Its background includes T cells, eosinophils, plasma cells, and macrophages, with occasional diagnostic Reed-Sternberg cells, which express PAX5, CD15, and CD30. Spread may involve spleen, liver, and bone marrow, infrequently associated with Epstein-Barr virus. Occurring equally in males and females, it commonly affects lower cervical, supraclavicular, and mediastinal lymph nodes in adolescents or young adults and has an excellent prognosis. Nodular Lymphocyte-Predominant Hodgkin Lymphoma ( Option B) is characterised by a background of follicular dendritic cells and reactive B cells, with frequent lymphocyte-rich (Popcorn cell) variants, typically does not express CD15 or CD30 and is usually EBV-negative. Lymphocyte-Rich Classical Hodgkin Lymphoma ( Option C) is characterised by a background infiltrate rich in T lymphocytes, with frequent mononuclear and diagnostic RS cells. RS cells of this type typically express CD15 and CD30 and are usually EBV-negative. Lymphocyte-Depleted Classical Hodgkin Lymphoma ( Option D) has a paucity of background reactive cells and frequent diagnostic RS cells. RS cells in lymphocyte-depleted classical Hodgkin lymphoma typically express CD15 and CD30 and are usually EBV-positive. It often presents with advanced disease.
