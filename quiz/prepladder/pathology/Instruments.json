      "explanation": "Correct Answer: A) Monocytes Explanation: The patient most likely has malaria which presents initially with fever, chills and weakness. On smear examination, there is monocytosis (cells with kidney-shaped nuclei) and parasites in ring forms within RBCs. Different types of WBC a) Granulocytes Neutrophils: 3-5 lobes and are involved in the acute inflammatory response to bacterial infection and the removal of the bacteria by phagocytosis. (Option B) Eosinophils : They have orange-red granules and a bilobed nucleus and are involved in chronic inflammation, allergic reactions, and host defence against parasitic infections. (Option D) Basophils: They have blue-black granules and their primary function is inflammation and allergic reaction. They act similar to Mast cells. (Option C) b) Agranulocytes Lymphocytes: They are part of the adaptive immune system. They are circulating immunocompetent cells that develop the ability to recognise and react to antigens. Monocytes: They have a kidney-shaped nucleus. In tissues, they differentiate into phagocytes , such as macrophages, osteoclasts and Kupffer cells and phagocytose bacteria, cells, and debris and function as antigen-presenting cells.

      "correct_answer": "D",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: D) Basophilia Explanation: Basophilic leukocytosis (basophilia) is a condition characterised by an increased number of basophils in the blood. This is a rare finding, most commonly associated with myeloproliferative neoplasms, such as Chronic Myeloid Leukemia (CML). Type of Leukocytosis Causes Neutrophilic leukocytosis (Option A) Acute bacterial infections (e.g., pyogenic organisms); Sterile inflammation (e.g., tissue necrosis) Burns, Leukemoid reactions Eosinophilic leukocytosis (eosinophilia) (Option B) Allergic disorders (e.g., asthma); Parasitic infestations Hodgkin Lymphoma Hay fever Tropical Pulmonary eosinophilia Basophilic leukocytosis (basophilia) Myeloproliferative neoplasm (e.g., chronic myeloid leukaemia ) Polycythaemia vera Myelofibrosis Monocytosis Chronic infections (e.g., tuberculosis ); Autoimmune disorders (e.g., systemic lupus erythematosus) Lymphocytosis (Option C) Viral infections (e.g., Epstein-Barr virus); Chronic immunologic stimulation (e.g., tuberculosis) Reference: Robbins and Cotran, Pathological Basis of Disease, 10th Edition, Page 588",

      "question": "A 17-year-old boy presented with complaints of a sore throat, fever, and extreme fatigue for the past two weeks.

      },
      "correct_answer": "D",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: D) Also known as Haemophagocytic Lymphohistiocytosis Explanation: Hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH) is a reactive condition marked by cytopenias and systemic inflammation due to macrophage activation. It is caused by the dysregulated activation of NK cells, CD8+ cytotoxic T-cells, and macrophages. Epstein-Barr virus infection is a common trigger. Clinical features include acute febrile illness, splenomegaly, hepatomegaly, anaemia, thrombocytopenia, elevated ferritin and IL-2 receptor levels, and liver dysfunction. Infectious mononucleosis, primarily caused by Epstein-Barr Virus (Option A), presents with fever, sore throat, lymphadenopathy, and splenomegaly, predominantly affecting late adolescents and young adults. Diagnosis relies on lymphocytosis with atypical lymphocytes, known as Downey cells (Ballerina skirt appearance) (Option C), which are activated CD8 T lymphocytes responding to EBV-infected cells. Positive heterophile antibody reaction (Monospot test) (Option B) and rising specific antibodies for EBV antigens aid in diagnosis.",

      "question": "A 58-year-old patient presents with fatigue, night sweats, and significant weight loss. Physical examination reveals generalized lymphadenopathy and splenomegaly. Blood tests show a markedly elevated white blood cell count. Based on the clinical scenario, which diagnosis is most likely if the bone marrow biopsy reveals over 20% blasts?",

        "A": "Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia (CLL)",
        "B": "Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML)",
        "C": "Hodgkin’s Lymphoma (HL)",
        "D": "Non-Hodgkin’s Lymphoma (NHL)"
      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: B) Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML) Explanation: Based on the clinical scenario and the bone marrow findings, the most likely diagnosis is Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML). Blasts in the bone marrow are a pivotal factor in diagnosing different types of leukaemia. When the bone marrow contains over 20% blasts, it indicates acute leukaemia rather than a chronic condition. Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML) is characterised by the rapid proliferation of abnormal myeloid blasts (Myeloblasts are identified by the presence of Auer rods), crowding out normal cells and leading to the symptoms observed. Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia (CLL) (Option A): CLL typically presents with mature lymphocytes , not blasts, in the bone marrow, distinguishing it from AML. Histopathology reveals smudge cells. The elevated blast count seen in the bone marrow biopsy is not characteristic of CLL. Hodgkin’s Lymphoma (Option C): HL is diagnosed via lymph node biopsy revealing Reed-Sternberg cells , not through a bone marrow biopsy showing high blast counts. The hallmark of HL is the presence of specific large abnormal lymphocytes, not blasts.HL primarily involves lymph nodes, with systemic symptoms such as night sweats and weight loss. Non-Hodgkin’s Lymphoma (NHL) (Option D): The diagnosis of NHL involves malignant lymphoid cells in affected tissues, not an increased blast percentage in the bone marrow.",

      "options": {},
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: B) Light Blue Explanation: The light blue Vacutainer contains sodium citrate as an anticoagulant and is specifically used for coagulation studies, such as Prothrombin Time (PT) and Activated Partial Thromboplastin Time (aPTT) . The anticoagulant preserves the coagulation factors for accurate testing. Colour Anti-coagulants Uses Purple/Lavender (Option D) EDTA (Ca2+ chelating anticoagulant) CBC, Peripheral Smear, ESR Light Blue (Option B) Citrate (Ca2+ chelating anticoagulant) ESR, PT, aPTT Red (Option A) No anti-coagulant is added Serum studies (Proteins, enzymes, hormones) Yellow Clot activator/Gel separator Serum studies (Proteins, enzymes, hormones) Grey Sodium Fluoride Blood Glucose Green (Option C) Heparin ABG, Osmotic fragility, flow cytometry, immunophenotyping",

      "question": "Which of the following diluting fluids correctly matches its specific use in haematology?",
      "options": {
        "A": "Turk's Solution - Platelets",
        "B": "Hayem's Solution - WBCs",
        "C": "Gower's Solution - RBCs",
        "D": "1% Ammonium Oxalate - WBCs"
      },
      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: C) Gower's Solution - RBCs Explanation: Gower's solution is specifically designed for the counting of RBCs. It provides a suitable environment for diluting blood samples while preserving the integrity and morphology of red blood cells. This solution ensures accurate counting of RBCs under a microscope without altering their appearance or function. Turk's Solution - Platelets (Option A): Turk's solution causes hemolysis of red blood cells and stains white blood cells for microscopic examination, not for platelet counting. Hayem's Solution - WBCs (Option B): Hayem’s solution is used for RBC counting rather than WBC due to its isotonicity preventing hemolysis, fixation, maintaining cell shape, and prevention of agglutination, with a longer shelf life. 1% Ammonium Oxalate - WBCs (Option D): Ammonium oxalate is used to prevent clotting in blood collection tubes and does not directly aid in white blood cell count in haematology.
