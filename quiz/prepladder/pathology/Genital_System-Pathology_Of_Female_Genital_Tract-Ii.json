      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: C) Serous cystadenocarcinoma Explanation: The given clinical presentation and histopathological findings point towards diagnosing Serous cystadenocarcinoma of the ovary, characterised by complex papillary structures, psammoma bodies, and atypical epithelial cells with evidence of stromal invasion. Gross morphology shows larger areas of solid or papillary growth, irregularity, and capsule nodularity. Transvaginal ultrasound shows a large, multicystic mass in the left ovary with papillary projections and solid areas. CA-125 levels are elevated.",

      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: B) 6 - 50% nonsquamous solid growth pattern Explanation: Endometrial carcinoma is of 2 types : 1. Endometrioid carcinoma can be a localised polyp or involve the entire endometrial lining. It demonstrates glandular growth patterns, which fall into 3 grades. FIGO Grading of endometrial carcinoma Grade 1 5% or less nonsquamous solid growth pattern (well-differentiated) with preserved glandular architecture (Option A) Grade 2 6 - 50% nonsquamous solid growth pattern (moderately differentiated) (Option B) Grade 3 > 50% nonsquamous solid growth pattern (poorly differentiated) (Option C) 2. Serous carcinomas are seen in atrophic uteri and are often large bulky tumors or deeply invasive into the myometrium. They are distinguished from endometrioid carcinoma by the marked cytologic atypia. They are all Grade 3 tumours and generally have extrauterine spread on the diagnosis.

      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: B) PTEN gene Explanation: PTEN gene inactivation is seen in both endometrial hyperplasia and endometrioid endometrial carcinoma. PTEN produces a lipid phosphatase, which is a suppressor of the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/AKT growth signalling pathway . Loss of PTEN function leads to excessive activation of the PI3K/AKT pathway, contributing to endometrial hyperplasia and cancer. Germline mutation of PTEN ,present on chromosome 10 is known as Cowden syndrome.

      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "junction. Correct Answer: B) Ectopic endometrial tissue is found at least 2.5 cm from the endometrial junction. Explanation: Adenomyosis is the presence of endometrial tissue within the myometrium at least 2.5 mm away from the endometrial / endomyometrial junction (not 2.5 cm). It is typically seen in pre-menopausal, multiparous women in their 30-40’s (Option C) and is associated with a history of prior uterine surgery like C-section and increased exposure to estrogen. Clinical presentation includes Irregular and heavy menstrual bleeding (menometrorrhagia) (Option A) Crampy menstrual pain (dysmenorrhea) Pain during intercourse (dyspareunia) Pelvic discomfort, particularly before menstruation. HPE shows irregular nests of endometrial stroma arranged within the myometrium (Option D) On per abdominal examination, uterus is tender and enlarged uniformly upto size of 12 weeks pregnant uterus Initial investigation is USG MRI is IOC- The most established MRI finding for adenomyosis is a junctional zone that's thicker than 12 mm. TOC is hysterectomy Adenomyosis MRI : can show salt and pepper appearance.",

      "question": "A 28-year-old woman with chronic pelvic pain worsened during menstrual periods and accompanied by heavy bleeding, was found to have a 'chocolate' brown cyst on her ovaries during a laparoscopy. What is the most commonly accepted theory for the pathogenesis of this condition?",
      "options": {
        "A": "Benign metastasis theory",
        "B": "Metaplastic theory",
        "C": "Extrauterine stem/progenitor cell theory",
        "D": "Regurgitation theory"
      },
      "correct_answer": "D",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: D) Regurgitation theory Explanation: The clinical presentation and presence of a chocolate brown cyst on the ovaries suggest Endometriosis . This condition often occurs due to retrograde menstruation through the fallopian tubes, which frequently occurs, leading to the implantation of endometrial tissue at ectopic sites due to the backward flow of menstrual endometrium. The regurgitation theory (Sampson’s theory) explains the presence of ectopic endometrial tissue in the peritoneal cavity, which is present in most cases; thus, it is widely accepted. Benign metastasis theory (Halban’s theory) (Option A) The benign metastasis theory suggests that endometrial tissue from the uterus can disseminate to distant locations, such as the bone, lungs, and brain, through blood vessels and lymphatic channels. Metaplastic theory (Meyer and Ivanoff’s theory) (Option B) The metaplastic theory suggests that endometrial tissue can develop directly from the coelomic epithelium, which is the embryonic origin of the Mullerian ducts and the endometrium. Extrauterine stem/progenitor cell theory (Option C) The Extrauterine stem/progenitor cell theory suggests that progenitor cells from the bone marrow differentiate into endometrial tissue.
