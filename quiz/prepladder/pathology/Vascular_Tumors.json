      "explanation": "Correct answer: A) 1>2>3>4 Explanation: Atherosclerosis is the thickening or hardening of the arteries caused by a buildup of plaque in the inner lining of an artery. It is the arterial wall's chronic inflammatory and healing response to endothelial injury. Risk factors: Nonmodifiable (Constitutional) Genetic abnormalities Family history Increasing age Male gender Modifiable Hyperlipidemia Hypertension Cigarette smoking Diabetes Inflammation Hyperhomocysteinemia Metabolic syndrome The pathogenesis of atherosclerosis is as follows: Endothelial injury and dysfunction cause increased vascular permeability, leukocyte adhesion, and thrombosis. Accumulation of lipoproteins (LDL) Monocyte adhesion to the endothelium, migration into intima and transformation into macrophages and foam cells. Platelet adhesion. Factor release from activated platelets, macrophages inducing SMC(smooth muscle cell) recruitment SMC proliferation, extracellular matrix production(ECM) Lipid accumulation is both extracellular and within macrophages and SMC. Calcification of ECM and necrotic debris.",

      "question": "A 65-year-old male presents with sudden-onset severe abdominal pain radiating to his back. On physical examination, a pulsatile mass is palpated in his abdomen.

      },
      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Correct answer: C) Abdominal aortic aneurysm Explanation: The clinical presentation of sudden-onset severe abdominal pain radiating to the back, along with a pulsatile abdominal mass, is highly suggestive of an abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA). The primary cause of aneurysms is atherosclerosis, with other factors including genetic predisposition, connective tissue disorders: Marfan syndrome, Ehlers-Danlos syndrome, trauma, and infection: Mycotic aneurysms. Pathogenesis: Aneurysms result from medial degeneration due to chronic inflammation, oxidative stress, and atherosclerosis. This process weakens the arterial wall, particularly in the abdominal aorta, leading to dilation and aneurysm formation. Clinical Features: Asymptomatic cases may be incidentally discovered during imaging studies. Sudden-onset severe abdominal or back pain Pulsatile abdominal mass on physical examination, Hypotension or shock due to rupture in severe cases. Management : Depending on the aneurysm size, symptoms, and patientâ€™s condition. Small asymptomatic AAAs (<5.5 cm)-Monitoring with periodic imaging Symptomatic, rapidly expanding (>1 cm/year), or large (>5.5 cm) AAAs- Elective repair via open or endovascular procedure Medical management- Slow atherosclerosis progression and reduce aneurysm risk.

      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Correct answer: B) Infantile hemangioma Explanation : The given clinical scenario suggests infantile/capillary hemangioma. Capillary hemangiomas or infantile hemangiomas are frequently encountered in benign vascular growth in infants. While most capillary hemangiomas are isolated, they can also occur as part of syndromes such as PHACE syndrome (posterior fossa malformations, hemangiomas, arterial anomalies, cardiac defects, eye abnormalities, and sternal clefting). They typically present as swiftly enlarging, vivid red lesions. A key distinguishing trait is their soft, yielding texture, which momentarily loses colour under pressure due to their abundant blood supply. They follow a pattern of rapid growth followed by spontaneous regression. Reference: Robbins and Cotran, Pathologic Basis of Disease, 10th edition, Pages 519, 520.",

      "explanation": "Correct answer: C) Glomus tumor Explanation: Glomus tumours are benign growths originating from the glomus body-modified smooth muscle cells specialised in temperature regulation. They typically manifest as painful, pulsating masses , often found under the nails of the fingers. Ganglion cysts (Option A) are noncancerous fluid-filled lumps frequently found on the wrists or fingers. Unlike glomus tumors, they are usually painless and yield to pressure. Bacillary angiomatosis (Option B) is a condition triggered by Bartonella bacteria. It typically causes red to purple papules or nodules on the skin. Cavernous lymphangioma aka cystic hygroma (Option D) is a benign tumor originating from lymphatic vessels. It often presents as a painless, soft mass, commonly in the head or neck region. It is commonly seen in Turnerâ€™s syndrome.",

An exophytic inflammatory lesion (red to purple, and commonly ulcerated) is typically observed on pregnant women's gingiva or skin (such as the fingers). It regresses after pregnancy. Microscopically: It features cells within lobules and the proliferation of blood vessels. Hemangiopericytoma (Option A) is a malignant condition marked by pericytes or Rouget cells encircling the blood vessels, leading to tumor formation. Microscopically, these cancerous cells display blood vessels with a staghorn or fishhook pattern. Kasabach-Merritt Syndrome (Option B) or KMS is a rare form of disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) associated with giant hemangiomas, where thrombi form within the tumor due to stasis and recurrent trauma to the fragile blood vessels.
