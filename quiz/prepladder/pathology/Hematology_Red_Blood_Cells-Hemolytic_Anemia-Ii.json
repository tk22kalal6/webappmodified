The family history is significant for an older brother who had transfusion-dependent anaemia and died of pneumococcal sepsis at the age of 6.

      "options": {},
      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "α 2 γ 2 Correct Answer: A) α 2 γ 2 Explanation: The given scenario is most likely suggestive of sickle cell anaemia. This child did not present with the disease earlier because of the presence of fetal haemoglobin (HbF) containing α 2 γ 2 HbF inhibits the polymerisation of HbS more effectively than HbA , so infants with sickle cell disease typically remain asymptomatic until 5 or 6 months of age when HbF levels naturally decline. In some individuals, higher levels of HbF persist, a condition known as hereditary persistence of fetal haemoglobin , which makes sickle cell disease less severe. α 2 β 2 & α 2 δ 2 are variants of normal adult haemoglobin present in the circulation ( Options B &C) Normal adult red cells contain HbA/Adult Hemoglobin A - α 2 β 2 [constitute 95% and above of all Hb] HbA2/Hemoglobin A2 - α 2 δ 2 [constitutes <3%] HbF/Fetal hemoglobin- α 2 γ 2. Fetal hemoglobin is the major hemoglobin in fetal RBCs during gestation and constitutes 60 to 80 percent of total hemoglobin in the full-term newborn. By approximately 6 to 12 months of age, Hb F is almost completely replaced by adult hemoglobin. ζ 2 ε 2 (Hb Gower-1) and α 2 ε 2 (Hb Gower-2) are hemoglobin chins seen in the embryonal period (Option D).

      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: B) C, D, and F Explanation: Sickle cell disease is a hemoglobinopathy caused by a missense point mutation in the 6th position of the β -globin chain This replaces the amino acid glutamine with valine which promotes the polymerization of deoxygenated hemoglobin . Heterozygous patients (HbAS) are said to have sickle cell trait where about 40% of the hemoglobin is HbS and the rest is HbA , which interferes with HbS polymerization. Therefore they have less severe disease than their homozygous counterparts who have more HbS. HbF inhibits HbS polymerization more effectively than HbA, keeping infants with sickle cell disease asymptomatic until 5-6 months when HbF levels decline. Metabolically active intracellular parasites consume oxygen and decrease intracellular pH, promoting sickling of HbAS red cells, which are then rapidly cleared by splenic and hepatic phagocytes, reducing parasite loads. In individuals with coexistent α -thalassemia, reduced Hb synthesis results in milder disease. Reference: Robbins & Cotran Pathologic Basis of Disease, 10th Edition, Page 641- 642",

      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Correct answer: C) Increased pH Explanation: Among the given options, increased pH/alkalosis does not lead to sickling, but rather decreased pH or acidosis. Factors affecting sickling: Dehydration - Higher HbS concentrations and increased MCHC due to intracellular dehydration enhance the likelihood of HbS aggregation and polymerization during deoxygenation, facilitating sickling. Hypoxia - Hypoxia induces sickling of cells Less pH (acidic environment): A decrease in pH reduces hemoglobin's oxygen affinity, increasing deoxygenated HbS and enhancing the tendency for sickling. Amount of HbS: Homozygous>heterozygous Interaction of HbS with the other types of hemoglobin: HbSC> HbSA/HbSA2 > HbSF (Fetal hemoglobin has more affinity towards oxygen, thus reducing sickling) Reference: Robbins & Cotran Pathologic Basis of Disease, 10th Edition, Page 641 - 642",

      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: C) Howell Jolly bodies Explanation: The peripheral smear of this patient would show Howell-Jolly bodies.They are basophilic nuclear remnants present in the RBC seen in conditions causing asplenia. Given the patient's age and history of blood transfusions, severe pain episodes in his hands and legs, and treatment aimed at increasing HbF (fetal hemoglobin) levels, it is likely that he has sickle cell disease along with asplenia due to recurrent vaso-occlusive crises. There is massive splenomegaly in early childhood due to sequestration. Repeated microvascular infarcts due to chronic erythrostasis and fibrosis causes it to atrophy and shrink over the years resulting in asplenia. This process is called autosplenectomy . Complications of asplenia: Susceptible to severe infections and sepsis by organisms: Encapsulated bacteria Pneumococcus Haemophilus influenzae type b Neisseria meningitidis Bordetella holmesii Bloodborne parasites Babesia spp Plasmodium spp Preventive measures include vaccination against S. pneumoniae, H. influenzae type b, N. meningitidis, influenza, and SARS-CoV-2; and prophylactic antibiotics. Heinz bodies are denatured and precipitated hemoglobin found inside RBCs seen in G6PD deficiency. Bite cells are formed due to removal of Heinz bodies by splenic macrophages (Options A and B) . Spherocytes are small, spherical RBCs without central pallor seen mainly in AIHA and hereditary spherocytosis (Option D) .",

Acute chest syndrome: Affecting the lungs, it presents with fever, cough, chest pain, and pulmonary infiltrates, potentially leading to life-threatening hypoxemia. 3. Renal papillary necrosis: Causes abrupt onset gross hematuria due to microvascular occlusion in the kidney. 4. Cerebrovascular accidents: Occlusions in the brain result in stroke. 5. Priapism: Painful, prolonged erection due to blood vessel occlusion in the penis. 6. Autosplenectomy - Repeated infarctions cause atrophy of the spleen. Aplastic crisis in SCD - Aplastic crises occur when red cell progenitors are infected by parvovirus B19, leading to a temporary halt in erythropoiesis and a sudden exacerbation of anemia. Sequestration crisis in SCD - Sequestration crisis affect children with intact spleens, characterized by significant trapping of sickled red cells, resulting in swift splenic enlargement, hypovolemia, and occasionally shock.

      "explanation": "Correct Answer: D) 1, 2, and 3 Explanation: Statements 1, 2, & 3 are correct. Statement 4 is wrong as thalassemia intermedia does not require regular blood transfusions. A thalassemia is a group of inherited blood disorders characterized by abnormal hemoglobin production, leading to anemia. Genetic defects in thalassemia involve mutations, insertions, or deletions in the genes responsible for producing hemoglobin chains This results in either decreased or absent production of alpha or beta-globin chains. These defects are inherited in an autosomal recessive manner, meaning an individual must inherit mutated alleles from both parents to manifest the disorder. There are two main types: alpha-thalassemia and beta-thalassemia. 1. Alpha-thalassemia: Resulting from deletions or mutations in the alpha-globin genes located on chromosome 16. 2. Beta-thalassemia: Arising from mutations in the beta-globin gene located on chromosome 11. Subtypes include: Beta-thalassemia minor (trait): Reduced beta-globin chain production due to mutations in one allele of the HBB gene. Beta-thalassemia major: Mutations in both alleles of the HBB gene, leading to severe anemia requiring lifelong transfusions and treatment. Thalassemia intermedia: Milder variants and unusual forms of β -thalassemia, also include alpha globin defects in some cases.

      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "C in the HBB gene. Correct Answer: C) Splicing mutation resulting in the removal of intervening sequence-IVS1-5 G-> C in the HBB gene. Explanation: Among the given options, Splicing mutation resulting in the removal of intervening sequence-IVS1-5 G-> C in the HBB gene leads to β -thalassemia: This mutation affects the splicing process by altering the consensus splice site, leading to aberrant splicing and abnormal mRNA transcripts, contributing to β -thalassemia. Beta-thalassemia mutations are diverse and can occur throughout the HBB gene, which encodes the beta-globin subunit of hemoglobin. These mutations can affect various aspects of beta-globin production, including transcription, splicing, mRNA stability, and translation. Common types of mutations include point mutations, small insertions or deletions, large deletions, and rearrangements within the HBB gene. These mutations disrupt normal hemoglobin synthesis, leading to reduced or absent beta-globin production and the characteristic clinical features of beta-thalassemia. 3-types of beta thalassemia: FEATURE THALASSEMIA MAJOR THALASSEMIA INTERMEDIA THALASSEMIA MINOR Beta chain production No beta chain production.

      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: A) RDW is typically elevated in IDA compared to beta-thalassemia minor coexistent IDA and beta-thalassemia traits. This is because in IDA, the erythropoiesis process is disrupted, leading to a more varied size of red blood cells and thus an increased RDW. In contrast, RDW tends to be lower in beta-thalassemia minor as most cells are just microcytic and hypochromic due to uniformly reduced hemoglobin synthesis. The Mentzer index, which is the MCV divided by the RBC count, is more useful in distinguishing between IDA and beta-thalassemia minor, with a lower Mentzer index (<13) indicating beta-thalassemia minor. Therefore, an elevated RDW favors a diagnosis of IDA over beta-thalassemia minor in this patient with microcytic, hypochromic anemia. Confirmatory testing with hemoglobin electrophoresis to detect elevated HbA2 levels (>3.5%) is required to diagnose beta-thalassemia minor.

      "explanation": "Correct Answer: C) black line visible only in the test tubes Explanation: A black line visible only in the test tubes containing blood sample mixed with a 0.36 buffered solution is suggestive of a positive Nestrof test. The Nestrof test, also known as the Naked Eye Single Tube Red Cell Osmotic Fragility Test, is a screening test used to identify carriers of beta thalassemia and sickle cell anemia. The test is based on the principle that red blood cells (RBCs) from individuals with beta thalassemia have red blood cells that are more fragile and burst more easily in hypotonic solutions Procedure: Bloood sample is mixed with 0.36% saline solution After incubation, observe the test tube against a black line. Look for the presence or absence of a black line behind the tube. Interpretation: Positive Test: Black line visible in only the test tube A positive NESTROFT indicates that red cells",
