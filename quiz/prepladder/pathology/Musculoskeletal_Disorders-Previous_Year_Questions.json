      "explanation": "However, it is associated with aneurysm formation. It occurs hyperlipidemia, inflammation, and hemodynamic disturbances. Aneurysm is seen in: Marfan syndrome - fibrillin defect Ehler-Danlos syndrome - collagen defect Loeys Dietz syndrome - TGF beta receptor defect leading to elastin defect Scurvy - collagen crosslinking defect Syphilis - tree bark aorta Incorrect Options: Options A, B, and D are connective tissue disorders associated with aneurysm formation.

      "question": "What is the likely diagnosis based on the provided X-ray image, along with normal clinical examination, hematological, and urinary test results, in a 65-year-old male patient?",
      "options": {
        "A": "Multiple myeloma",
        "B": "Langerhans cell histiocytosis",
        "C": "Metastasis",
        "D": "Hyperparathyroidism"
      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "disorder characterized by the proliferation and accumulation of Langerhans cells , a type of immune cell, in various tissues. LCH can affect multiple organs , including the bone, skin, and lymph nodes. In the context of the given X-ray showing a punched-out lytic lesion in the cranium, LCH becomes a probable diagnosis. Incorrect options: Option A . Multiple myeloma : Multiple myeloma is a type of blood cancer that involves the abnormal proliferation of plasma cells, a type of white blood cell, in the bone marrow. Multiple myeloma is usually associated with abnormal hematological and urinary test results, which were reported as normal in this case. Option C . Metastasis: Metastatic lesions can be seen in various organs, including the bone. However, the X-ray findings alone cannot definitively indicate metastasis. A detailed clinical history and further investigations, such as imaging studies and biopsy, are necessary to identify the primary tumor and confirm metastasis. Option D . Hyperparathyroidism: Hyperparathyroidism is a condition characterized by excessive secretion of parathyroid hormone (PTH) by the parathyroid glands, leading to high levels of calcium in the blood. While hyperparathyroidism can cause bone changes, such as osteopenia or osteoporosis, the typical X-ray appearance associated with hyperparathyroidism is not a punched-out lytic lesion.

      "question": "A 36 year old male with skin – colored umbilicated papules. Microscopy is as shown below. The most likely diagnosis is?",
      "options": {
        "A": "Herpes virus",
        "B": "Verruca vulgaris",
        "C": "Molluscum contagiosum",
        "D": "Lichen planus"
      },
      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "the molluscum contagiosum virus (MCV). Molluscum contagiosum presents as skin-coloured or pearly umbilicated papules. Microscopically, it shows characteristic intracytoplasmic inclusions called molluscum bodies. These bodies consist of aggregates of viral particles surrounded by host cell reaction. The given clinical presentation of skin-coloured umbilicated papules along with the provided microscopic image of molluscum bodies strongly suggests molluscum contagiosum. Incorrect Option: Option A : Herpes virus. Herpes virus infections typically present with grouped vesicles or ulcers and are associated with a burning or tingling sensation. The microscopic appearance of herpes virus infection would show multinucleated giant cells and intranuclear inclusions called Cowdry bodies. This description does not match the clinical and microscopic findings provided, so herpes virus is an incorrect option. Option B : Verruca vulgaris, also known as common warts, is caused by the human papillomavirus (HPV). Verruca vulgaris presents as rough, hyperkeratotic papules with a characteristic cauliflower-like appearance. Microscopically, verruca vulgaris would show hyperkeratosis, acanthosis, and presence of koilocytes (enlarged keratinocytes with perinuclear clearing). The given clinical presentation and microscopic image do not correspond to verruca vulgaris, so this option is incorrect. Option D : Lichen planus is a",

      "question": "Which of the following is the most abundant glycoprotein in basement membranes?",

        "A": "Fibronectin",
        "B": "Laminin",
        "C": "Integrin",
        "D": "Syndecan"
      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "membranes. It is a large protein complex composed of three different polypeptide chains ( α , β , and γ ) that form a cross-shaped structure. Laminin plays a crucial role in the structure and function of basement membranes, including cell adhesion, migration, and signalling. Incorrect Options: Option A - Fibronectin: Fibronectin is a glycoprotein present in the extracellular matrix and is not the most abundant glycoprotein in basement membranes. Option C - Integrin: Integrins are cell surface receptors that mediate cell adhesion to the extracellular matrix but are not glycoproteins themselves. Option D - Syndecan: Syndecan is a transmembrane heparan sulfate proteoglycan and is not the most abundant glycoprotein in basement membranes. Reference: Prepladder Notes",

      "explanation": "to form microtubules, which are involved in various cellular processes such as intracellular transport, cell division, and the maintenance of cell structure. Incorrect Options: Option A - Vimentin: Vimentin is an intermediate filament protein found in various types of cells, including mesenchymal cells, fibroblasts, and endothelial cells. It provides structural support to the cytoskeleton and helps maintain cell shape and integrity. Option C - Desmin: Desmin is an intermediate filament protein primarily found in muscle cells, including skeletal, cardiac, and smooth muscle cells. It provides structural support to muscle fibers and plays a role in maintaining muscle integrity. Option D - Neurofilament: Neurofilament is an intermediate filament protein specifically found in neurons. It contributes to the structural organization of neuronal axons and provides mechanical support to the axons, allowing for efficient signal transmission. Reference: Prepladder Notes",
