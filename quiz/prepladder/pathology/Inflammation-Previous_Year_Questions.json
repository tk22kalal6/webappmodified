      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: B) Phagocytosis Explanation: NETs (Neutrophil Extracellular Traps) do not directly engulf pathogens through phagocytosis but instead trap and immobilise them, allowing other immune cells to clear the infection. They are extracellular fibrillar networks that concentrate antimicrobial substances at sites of infection and trap microbes, helping to prevent their spread. They don’t directly phagocytose pathogens but trap and immobilise them, allowing immune cells like macrophages to eliminate them. (Option B) They are produced by neutrophils in response to pathogens and inflammatory mediators. NET formation begins with ROS-induced activation of arginine deaminase, leading to chromatin decondensation. (Option D ruled out) They are composed of nuclear chromatin and granule proteins, including antimicrobial peptides and enzymes. They are implicated in conditions like sepsis (Option C ruled out) and autoimmune diseases like lupus (Option A ruled out) , where they may contribute to autoimmunity. A neutrophil granulocyte (yellow) has ejected a NET (green) to capture bacteria (purple). A red blood cell (orange) is also trapped in the NET.",

      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "characterized by controlled and regulated cell dismantling. It can be initiated through both intrinsic and extrinsic pathways. The intrinsic pathway is triggered by internal signals, such as DNA damage or cellular stress, leading to the release of cytochrome c from the mitochondria. The extrinsic pathway is initiated by external signals, such as binding of death ligands (e.g., Fas ligand) to death receptors on the cell surface. Incorrect Options: Option B: Necrosis: This option is incorrect. Necrosis is a form of cell death that occurs due to uncontrolled injury or damage. It is characterized by cell swelling, membrane rupture, and the release of cellular contents into the surrounding tissue. Necrosis does not involve the intrinsic or extrinsic pathways seen in apoptosis, as it is not a programmed process. Option C: Necroptosis: This option is incorrect. Necroptosis is a programmed form of necrosis, distinct from apoptosis, that occurs under specific conditions. It is triggered by certain death receptors, such as tumor necrosis factor receptor 1 (TNFR1) and involves a cascade of intracellular events leading to cell death. However, necroptosis does not involve the intrinsic or extrinsic pathways associated with apoptosis. Option D: Pyroptosis: This option is incorrect. Pyroptosis is a highly inflammatory form of programmed cell death that occurs in response to infection or cellular stress. It is characterized by the formation of large pores in the plasma membrane, leading to cell lysis and the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines. Pyroptosis is distinct from apoptosis and does not involve the intrinsic or extrinsic pathways seen in apoptosis. Reference: .",

      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: A) 1, 2, 3, 4 Explanation: The correct sequence of cellular events of inflammation is as follows: Rolling: It involves the interaction between selectins on endothelial cells and their ligands on leukocytes. This interaction causes leukocytes to roll along the endothelial surface. Cytokine-mediated integrin activation: Inflammatory cytokines, such as TNF-alpha and IL-1 , are released at the site of inflammation. These cytokines induce the activation of integrins in leukocytes. Integrins are cell adhesion molecules that bind to their ligands on endothelial cells, promoting stronger adhesion. Adhesion: Activated integrins on leukocytes bind to their ligands on endothelial cells, such as ICAM-1 and VCAM-1. This adhesion stabilizes the interaction between leukocytes and endothelial cells, allowing leukocytes to adhere firmly to the endothelial surface. Migration: Leukocytes undergo diapedesis, or transmigration, after firmly adhering to the endothelial cells. They migrate through the endothelial junctions and move towards tissue injury or infection sites, guided by chemotactic signals. Leukocyte migration involves multiple steps: neutrophils first roll, then activate and adhere to the endothelium, transmigrate across it, pierce the basement membrane, and migrate toward chemoattractants from the injury site.

        "D": "Complements"
      },
      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: C) VCAM-1 Explanation: VCAM-1 (Vascular Cell Adhesion Molecule-1) is involved in the adhesion of leukocytes to the endothelium during inflammation. It binds to integrins on the surface of leukocytes, facilitating their migration through the endothelium to the site of injury or infection. Leukocyte Adhesion to Endothelium: In normal blood flow, leukocytes are pushed to the edges of the vessel. In inflammation, stasis causes leukocytes to slow down and interact with endothelial cells. This interaction involves selectins and integrins , which mediate the rolling and firm adhesion of leukocytes. Selectins : These are responsible for the initial rolling interactions . There are three types: L-selectin on leukocytes E-selectin on endothelial cells P-selectin (Option A) on both platelets and endothelial cells The ligands for selectins are sialylated oligosaccharides on mucin-like glycoproteins. Cytokines like TNF and IL-1 upregulate the expression of selectins, promoting leukocyte rolling along the vessel wall. Integrins : After rolling, leukocytes bind more firmly to the endothelium via integrins, such as VLA-4 and LFA-1 (CD11a & CD18) , which interact with endothelial ligands like VCAM-1 and ICAM-1 . This firm adhesion halts the rolling process and allows leukocytes to flatten and spread on the endothelial surface. Migration: Once firmly adhered, leukocytes migrate through the endothelial layer (transmigration), facilitated by adhesion molecules like PECAM-1 (CD31). After exiting the vessel, they follow the chemotactic gradient toward the site of inflammation. Platelet-activating factor (PAF) (Option B) is a potent mediator of inflammation, influencing various processes like platelet aggregation, vasodilation, and immune cell activation, but it does not directly contribute to leukocyte adhesion to the endothelium. Complement (Option D) proteins are part of the immune system and are involved in opsonisation, lysis of pathogens, and inflammation. However, they do not directly mediate the adhesion of leukocytes to the endothelium. Reference: Robbins & Cotran Pathologic Basis of Disease, 10th Edition, Page 77, 78, 79",

        "B": "Prostaglandin",
        "C": "Leukotriene",

      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "converts arachidonic acid into prostaglandins, which are involved in inflammation, pain, and fever. Arachidonic Acid Metabolites: Arachidonic acid (AA) is a 20-carbon polyunsaturated fatty acid (5,8,11,14-eicosatetraenoic acid). It is stored in membrane phospholipids and released through the action of phospholipase A2 . AA is then converted into lipid mediators, known as eicosanoids, through the action of cyclooxygenases and lipoxygenases. Prostaglandins (PGs): Produced by Mast cells, macrophages, endothelial cells, and other cell types. Involved in Vascular and systemic reactions of inflammation. Enzymes : Prostaglandins are synthesized via cyclooxygenase enzymes (COX-1 and COX-2). COX-1 is constitutively expressed and performs homeostatic functions, while COX-2 is induced in response to inflammation. Key Prostaglandins : PGI2 (prostacyclin) is produced by the vascular endothelium and acts as a vasodilator and inhibitor of platelet aggregation. TXA2 is produced by platelets and causes platelet aggregation and vasoconstriction. PGD2 and PGE2 cause vasodilation and increase the permeability of postcapillary venules, promoting oedema formation. PGE2 also contributes to pain and fever during inflammation. Leukotrienes: Produced by : Leukocytes and mast cells through the action of lipoxygenase enzymes, particularly 5-lipoxygenase . Involved in vascular reactions, smooth muscle contraction, and leukocyte recruitment. Key Leukotrienes : LTB4 is a potent chemotactic agent that activates neutrophils and promotes adhesion, generates reactive oxygen species (ROS), and releases lysosomal enzymes. Cysteinyl leukotrienes (LTC4, LTD4, LTE4) cause vasoconstriction, bronchospasm (important in asthma), and increase vascular permeability. Lipoxins: Produced by : Lipoxins are synthesized via the lipoxygenase pathway, involving both neutrophils and platelets for transcellular biosynthesis. Function : Lipoxins suppress inflammation by inhibiting neutrophil chemotaxis and adhesion to the endothelium, thus limiting the inflammatory response. Kreb’s cycle (Option A) is part of cellular respiration and involves the metabolism of carbohydrates, fats, and proteins to generate energy. Cyclooxygenase is not involved in this cycle. Leukotriene (Option C) is another class of eicosanoids derived from arachidonic acid, but it is produced via the 5-lipoxygenase pathway, not the cyclooxygenase pathway. Vitamin K (Option D) is involved in the coagulation cascade and is not related to the action of cyclooxygenase.",

      "explanation": "γ Correct Answer: A) Interferon- γ and fever, along with the histological finding of granulomas and multinucleated giant cells, is highly indicative of a granulomatous condition like Tuberculosis (TB) , which is typically driven by the immune response, specifically by the cytokine interferon- γ (IFN- γ ) T-lymphocytes release IFN- γ when exposed to M. tuberculosis antigens, which activate macrophages, enhancing their ability to kill intracellular bacteria. Despite IFN- γ activation of macrophages, the bacteria are often not completely eliminated, and they can survive inside the macrophages, evading complete eradication. This results in a chronic infection , leading to continued replication of M. tuberculosis and the formation of granulomas . The granuloma acts as a protective structure around the bacteria, but in some cases, it can break down, leading to active disease and further spread of the infection. Complement C5a (Option B) is a chemotactic factor in the complement system . It helps attract neutrophils and other immune cells to the site of infection.

(Option A ruled out) There are four principal causes of hypercalcemia: Increased secretion of parathyroid hormone (PTH) : Hyperparathyroidism (parathyroid tumours) and ectopic secretion of PTH-related protein (malignant tumours). Resorption of bone tissue, secondary to primary tumours of bone marrow (e.g., multiple myeloma, leukaemia) or diffuse skeletal metastasis (e.g., breast cancer), accelerated bone turnover (e.g., Paget disease), or immobilisation. Vitamin D–related disorders , including vitamin D intoxication, sarcoidosis, and idiopathic hypercalcemia of infancy (Williams syndrome). Renal failure , which causes retention of phosphate (Secondary hyperparathyroidism). Less common causes include aluminium intoxication, which occurs in patients on chronic renal dialysis, and milk-alkali syndrome, which is due to excessive ingestion of calcium and absorbable antacids such as milk or calcium carbonate.",

      },
      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: A) NADPH oxidase Explanation: NADPH oxidase is the most effective enzyme in acute inflammation. The Phox gene produces it and is the key enzyme involved in phagocytosis. Reactive oxygen species (ROS) are produced through the rapid assembly and activation of NADPH oxidase (phagocyte oxidase) . This enzyme oxidises NADPH , transferring electrons to molecular oxygen and generating superoxide anion (O I •) . Defensins (Option B) are small antimicrobial peptides that help eliminate pathogens, but they are not the main enzyme involved in acute inflammation. Catalase (Option C) is an enzyme that decomposes hydrogen peroxide (H I O I ) to protect cells from oxidative damage, but it is not the primary enzyme involved in the inflammatory response. MPO (Myeloperoxidase) (Option D) is an enzyme present in neutrophils that utilises hydrogen peroxide (produced by NADPH oxidase) to generate hypochlorous acid (HOCl), a potent antimicrobial agent. However, the most critical enzyme in acute inflammation is NADPH oxidase. Reference: Robbins & Cotran Pathologic Basis of Disease, 10th Edition, Page 82.",

However, albumin is a negative acute-phase reactant , meaning its levels decrease during inflammation as the liver prioritizes synthesizing proteins involved in the inflammatory response. They are plasma proteins, mostly synthesized in the liver, whose plasma concentrations may increase several hundred–fold as part of the response to inflammatory stimuli. Few of these examples are: C-reactive protein (CRP) (Option A ruled out) Fibrinogen (Option C ruled out) Serum amyloid A (SAA) protein. Hepcidin (Option B ruled out) Thrombopoietin These are increased during the process of inflammation. Reference: Robbins and Cotran Pathologic Basis of Disease, 10th Edition, Page 102.",

      "explanation": "γ typically involved in the Jarisch-Herxheimer reaction. Instead, TNF-alpha, IL-6, and IL-8 play a key role in this reaction. Jarisch-Herxheimer Reaction: It is a dramatic but self-limited inflammatory response that can occur after the initiation of treatment for syphilis. It is characterized by: Fever Chills Myalgia (muscle pain) Headache Tachycardia (increased heart rate) Increased respiratory rate Elevated circulating neutrophil count Vasodilation with mild hypotension This reaction is believed to be triggered by the release of lipoproteins from dying Treponema pallidum organisms. The reaction occurs in approximately 50% of patients with primary syphilis, 90% of those with secondary syphilis, and in a smaller proportion of individuals with later-stage disease. Symptoms typically subside within 12–24 hours. In patients with secondary syphilis, erythema (redness) and oedema (swelling) of cutaneous lesions may worsen temporarily. TNF alpha (Option A) is a pro-inflammatory cytokine produced by macrophages and T cells , playing a central role in inflammation. It is implicated in the Jarisch-Herxheimer reaction , where cytokine release following antibiotic treatment temporarily worsens symptoms. IL-6 (Option B) is a pro-inflammatory cytokine produced by immune cells, fibroblasts, and endothelial cells , regulating immune responses and inflammation. It contributes to the Jarisch-Herxheimer reaction by amplifying the systemic inflammatory response. IL-8 (Option C) is a chemokine that recruits and activates neutrophils , playing a role in infection and inflammation . It contributes to the Jarisch-Herxheimer reaction by enhancing neutrophil recruitment and activation. Reference: Harrison’s Principles of Internal Medicine, 21st Edition, Page 1413",
