      "question": "A 28-year-old female presents with a painless, bluish, fluctuant and translucent swelling on the lower lip that enlarges with eating or pressure, as shown in the image below. She reports a history of accidentally biting her lip frequently. What histopathological feature would be expected on biopsy of the lesion?",

      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "cells. Correct Answer: A) Mucin-filled cavity surrounded by granulation tissue and chronic inflammatory cells. Explanation: The clinical presentation and the image suggest Mucocele, a benign cystic lesion caused by the accumulation of saliva due to trauma or obstruction of the salivary gland duct. Histologically, it is characterized by a mucin-filled cavity without an epithelial lining (in the extravasation type), surrounded by granulation tissue and chronic inflammatory cells , especially macrophages (mucinophages). Retention cysts show a t rue cyst lined by ductal epithelium. Treatment Cryotherapy : Freezing the cyst with extreme cold to destroy it. Laser Treatment : Using a laser to remove the lesion. Surgical Excision : Removing the cyst and possibly the affected salivary gland.",

      "question": "A 45-year-old female presents with a painless, slowly growing mass in her left parotid gland. Examination reveals a firm, mobile mass.

        "D": "Down-regulation of PLAG1 results in abnormal cell proliferation"
      },
      "correct_answer": "D",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: D) Down-regulation of PLAG1 results in abnormal cell proliferation PLAG1 (pleomorphic adenoma gene 1) is a proto-oncogene whose overexpression is a crucial oncogenic event in salivary gland pleomorphic adenomas. Due to chromosomal rearrangements in pleomorphic adenoma, there is overexpression of PLAG1 (transcription factor) resulting in increased cell growth and increased proliferation. Hence, down-regulation of PLAG 1 does not happen in pleomorphic adenoma. Reference: Robbins and Cotran Pathologic basis of disease, 10th Edition, Page 748",

        "D": "Presence of hyalinized stroma within the tumour"
      },
      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: C) Increased age of the lesion. Explanation: Rates of malignant transformation in pleomorphic adenoma correlate with the age of the lesion; 2% of tumours that have been present for less than 5 years harbor cancers, but this increases to 10% for those present for more than 15 years. Risk factors of pleomorphic adenoma Age : Higher incidence in older individuals, especially over 50. Smoking : Increased risk with a history of more than 10 pack-years. Radiation Exposure : Previous head and neck radiation therapy or occupational exposure. Chemical Exposure : Contact with chemicals in rubber manufacturing, asbestos mining, or plumbing. Diet : High cholesterol intake may contribute. Sex : More common in females. Reference: Reference: Robbins and Cotran Pathologic basis of disease, 10th edition, Page 748",

      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: A) Most commonly occur in the parotid and submandibular glands. Explanation: The clinical presentation and characteristic ‘Swiss cheese’ appearance on MRI with basaloid cells and cribriform pattern on FNAC suggest Adenoid cystic carcinoma, which most commonly affects parotid and submandibular glands. 50% of these relatively uncommon tumours occur in the minor salivary glands. Adenoid Cystic Carcinoma (ACC) Incidence and Sites : 50% occur in minor salivary glands (e.g., palatine glands). Also found in parotid and submandibular glands , and extraglandular sites (nose, sinuses, lung, breast). Pathogenesis : Associated with MYB-NFIB gene rearrangements in some cases. Morphology : Gross : Small, poorly encapsulated, infiltrative, gray-pink lesions. Microscopic : Cribriform (\"Swiss cheese\") pattern with hyaline-filled spaces. Other patterns: tubular and solid. Small cells with dark nuclei and scant cytoplasm. Slow-growing but highly invasive, often showing perineural invasion . Frequently recurs and disseminates to distant sites (bone, liver, brain) even decades later. MYB-NFIB gene rearrangements are present in all cases (Option B) MYB-NFIB gene rearrangements are present in a subset of adenoid cystic carcinomas and not in all cases. Encapsulated lesions with a smooth surface (Option C) Adenoid cystic carcinomas are small, poorly encapsulated, infiltrative, gray-pink lesions composed of small cells with dark, compact nuclei and scant cytoplasm. The tumour cells are organized in a cribriform growth pattern that resembles Swiss cheese. Tend to grow rapidly and have a high mitotic rate (Option D) Adenoid cystic carcinomas are slow-growing tumours that tend to invade perineural spaces, indicating a low mitotic rate.
