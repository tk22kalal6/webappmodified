        "A": "The mucosa is the first layer of the digestive tract.",
        "B": "The submucosa is absent in the gallbladder.",
        "C": "The muscularis propria is present throughout the GIT.",
        "D": "The esophagus lacks the submucosal layer."
      },
      "correct_answer": "D",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer:D) The esophagus lacks the submucosal layer Explanation: “ The oesophagus lacks the submucosa layer” is incorrect as it contains submucosa but lacks serosa. The GIT is histologically made up of 4 layers. Layer Description Mucosa Innermost Layer (Option A) Mucous Membrane Lamina Propria Muscularis Mucosa Lining Epithelium (Varies by Region) Esophagus: Nonkeratinized Squamous Epithelium Stomach: Simple Columnar Epithelium Intestine: Simple Columnar Epithelium with Brush Border Anal Canal: Columnar Epithelium above Pectinate Line Stratified Squamous Epithelium below Pectinate Line Submucosa Contains: Nerves (Meissner's Plexus) Absent in Gallbladder (Mucosa directly supported by Connective Tissue) (Option B) Muscularis Propria Responsible for Peristaltic Movements (Propels Food from Esophagus to Anal Canal) Contains Myenteric Nerve Plexus Present throughout the GI tract (Option C) Serosa Outer Protective Sheath (Most of Intestine) It is the visceral peritoneum, as peritoneum is absent in the thoracic cavity, hence the esophagus is covered by adventitia.

      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer:A) Metaplasia of squamous epithelium Explanation : The primary cellular change seen in Barrett's oesophagus is metaplasia of squamous epithelium into intestinal/columnar epithelium. Dysplasia of squamous epithelium(Option B). Dysplasia is a premalignant change that refers to disordered cell growth with pleomorphism, abnormal architecture and a loss of orderly differentiation. It is seen in long-standing and untreated cases of Barrett's oesophagus. Hyperplasia and hypertrophy(Options C & D) refer to an increase in the number and size of cells, respectively. Barrett's refers to a change in cell type, not number or size.",

      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer:B) Adenocarcinoma Explanation: The above scenario and an image showing goblet cells within the columnar epithelium suggest Barret’s esophagus, which puts the patient at an increased risk of adenocarcinoma of the esophagus. Esophageal disease progression A: Normal esophagus; B: Esophagitis; C: BE with goblet cells; D: Dysplasia; E: EAC. EAC: Esophageal adenocarcinoma; BE: Barrett's esophagus. Barrett's esophagus is diagnosed based on endoscopic evidence of metaplastic columnar mucosa above the gastroesophageal junction. It is seen as red, velvety mucosa extending upward from the gastroesophageal junction.

Goblet cells are diagnostic of Barrett esophagus and have distinct mucous vacuoles that stain blue with Alcian blue . This imparts the shape of a wine goblet to the remaining cytoplasm.

      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: C) Iron deficiency anemia Explanation: This patient's condition is most likely suggestive of Plummer-Vinson syndrome, which is associated with iron deficiency anemia. Plummer-Vinson Syndrome (Paterson-Kelly Syndrome, Sideropenic Dysphagia) Characterized by a triad of: Iron-deficiency anemia Upper esophageal webs Post- Cricoid Dysphagia Common in middle-aged women Increased risk of squamous cell carcinoma (pharynx and proximal esophagus) Other Findings Glossitis Angular cheilitis Koilonychia Post cricoid Dysphagia Caused by esophageal webs/rings in the upper esophagus This leads to swallowing difficulties, especially with solid foods Worsens over time Aetiology and Treatment Iron deficiency is the main cause Treatable with iron supplementation Other options: Peutz-Jeghers syndrome ( Option A) features GI polyps and mucocutaneous lesions with dark blue to dark brown melanotic macules around the mouth. It is not typically associated with dysphagia and esophageal webs. Degeneration of nitric oxide –producing neurons ( Option B) is a feature of achalasia. It is characterized by incomplete lower esophageal sphincter relaxation, increased sphincter tone, and aperistalsis of the esophagus. Apple core appearance(Option D) on imaging is seen in oesophageal carcinoma due to irregular narrowing of the esophagus with mucosal irregularity. It initially presents with dysphagia to solids. However, there are typically no oral lesions in oesophageal cancer.",

Explanation: The given image suggests eosinophilic esophagitis, where Interleukin 5 has a major role in pathogenesis. Eosinophilic Esophagitis: Triggered by allergic reactions to food or environmental allergens (Option A) Associated with atopic dermatitis, allergic rhinitis, asthma, and peripheral eosinophilia Pathophysiology Interleukin 5 (IL-5) key cytokine for eosinophil maturation and activation Clinical Manifestations Dysphagia Epigastric pain Dyspepsia Chest pain Food impaction Diagnostic Criteria Eosinophils ≥ 15 per high power field (HPF) on HPE (Option D) Endoscopic Findings: Stacked circular rings (\"feline esophagus\") ( Option C) Strictures Linear furrows Characteristic rat tail appearance (Option B)- The characteristic appearance seen in eosinophilic esophagitis on endoscopy is not a \"rat tail\" (Rat tail appearance is seen in radiography of cancer esophagus) but rather \"feline esophagus.\" This refers to the presence of stacked circular rings, which resemble the striped tail of a cat.",
