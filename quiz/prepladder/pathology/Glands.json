Lactotrophs and thyrotrophs are examples of cells found respectively with these staining. The pituitary consists of 2 lobes. Anterior pituitary/ Adenohypophysis - Contains many hormone-producing cells. These cells can be acidophilic, basophilic or poorly staining based on the staining pattern. Acidophils- Eosinophilic/pink colored- Sommatotrophs and lactotrophs Basophils- Basophilic/blue colored- Corticotrophs, thyrotrophs, and gonadotrophs Chromophobe cells- poorly staining cytoplasm 2. Posterior Pituitary/Neurohypophysis- Contains nerve endings from the hypothalamus that store and release hormones produced in the hypothalamus.",

I They are well-circumscribed and encapsulated. I They are the most common type of pituitary tumor and can be classified based on size as follows. Pituitary carcinoma ( Option B) : Is very rare and have malignant cells showing nuclear pleomorphism along with invasive growth and metastasis. Schwannoma (Option D) : Schwannomas are tumors of Schwann cells found along peripheral nerves. They display spindle-shaped cells in a palisading pattern and stain positive for S-100 protein. They do not arise in the pituitary gland.",
