      },
      "correct_answer": "D",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: D) Accumulation of CD4+ T cells and increased CD4/CD8 T-cell ratios Sarcoid granulomas exhibit an accumulation of CD4+ T cells, with CD4/CD8 T-cell ratios ranging from 5: 1 to 15: 1. Several immunologic abnormalities in the local milieu of sarcoid granulomas suggest a cell-mediated immune response to an unidentified antigen. These abnormalities include: Intra-alveolar and interstitial accumulation of CD4+ T cells, resulting in CD4/CD8 T-cell ratios ranging from 5: 1 to 15: 1, suggesting pathogenic involvement of CD4+ helper T cells. (Option A) There is an oligoclonal expansion of T-cell subsets (Option B) Increased T cell-derived Th1 cytokines such as IL-2 and interferon (IFN)- γ may be responsible for T-cell expansion and macrophage activation, respectively. (Option C) Several cytokines (IL-8, TNF, macrophage inflammatory protein) are increased in the local environment. TNF released by macrophages in the bronchoalveolar fluid is a marker of disease activity. Systemically, there is anergy to skin test antigens and polyclonal hypergammaglobulinemia.

      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: B) Lofgren's syndrome Explanation : This patient's clinical presentation and lab findings are suggestive of Lofgren’s syndrome which is associated with sarcoidosis. A history of uveitis, elevated levels of serum angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE), which is a marker of granulomatous activity, and hypercalcemia (increased activation of vitamin D by macrophages within granulomas) all point to systemic involvement and suggest sarcoidosis. Lofgren syndrome triad: Bilateral hilar lymphadenopathy Acute polyarthritis Erythema nodosum - tender, red nodules on the skin, typically on the shins (as shown in the image) Lupus pernio (Option A): Cutaneous manifestation of sarcoidosis characterised by violaceous or erythematous indurated plaques distributed on the central face, particularly the nose and cheeks. Mikulicz syndrome (Option C): Defined as diffuse and bilateral enlargement of the salivary and lacrimal glands. It can occur as an isolated phenomenon or as a part of systemic diseases like sarcoidosis, Sjögren syndrome, etc. Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (Option D): Autoimmune disease affecting multiple organs, including the skin, joints, kidneys, and heart. Common symptoms of SLE include joint pain, skin rash (such as the classic butterfly rash), fatigue, and organ involvement.",

      "explanation": "Correct Answer: B) Non-necrotizing granulomas with asteroid bodies and Schaumann bodies (stellate-shaped structures) and Schaumann bodies (calcium and protein inclusions). Asteroid Bodies: Asteroid bodies are stellate or star-shaped structures seen within the cytoplasm of giant cells. They are composed of aggregated proteinaceous material consisting primarily of fibrin. The image below shows asteroid bodies. Schaumann Bodies: They are concentrically laminated, basophilic structures found within the cytoplasm of giant cells. They comprise calcium and proteinaceous material, such as mucopolysaccharides and immunoglobulins. Macrophages with abundant cytoplasm containing dusty brown pigment (smokers’ macrophages) (Option A) are seen in desquamative interstitial pneumonia and respiratory bronchiolitis–associated interstitial lung disease. Coalescent tubercles with central caseation (Option C) are seen in active lesions of secondary tuberculosis. Curschmann spirals (extrusion of mucus plugs from subepithelial mucous glands) and Charcot-Leyden crystals (composed of the eosinophil-derived protein) (Option D) are characteristic findings in sputum or bronchoalveolar lavage specimens of patients with atopic asthma.",

        "D": "Psittacosis"
      },
      "correct_answer": "D",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: D) Psittacosis Explanation: As the histopathology shows carbon-laden macrophages, it is not associated with Psittacosis which is a zoonotic bacterial infection caused by Chlamydia psittaci, contracted from exposure to infected birds, such as parrots. Carbon deposits are dark black and are readily visible grossly and microscopically. Inhaled carbon pigment is engulfed by alveolar or interstitial macrophages, accumulating in the connective tissue adjacent to the lymphatics and organised lymphoid tissue adjacent to the bronchi or lung hilum. Anthracosis (Option A) is the deposition of carbon particles in the lungs due to chronic inhalation of smoke, soot, or pollution. It is commonly seen in urban dwellers, smokers, and coal workers. HPE shows carbon-laden macrophages. Coal Worker’s P neumoconiosis (CWP) Simple CWP (Option B) Complicated CWP (Option C) It is characterised by coal macules (1 to 2 mm in diameter) and larger coal nodules containing carbon-laden macrophages and a delicate network of collagen fibres. Although these lesions are scattered throughout the lung, the upper lobes and upper zones of the lower lobes are more heavily involved. Dilatation of alveoli adjacent to bronchioles gives rise to centrilobular emphysema. It leads to progressive massive fibrosis and large, dark scars measuring 1 to 10 cm in diameter, often appearing in multiple areas. Microscopically, these lesions contain dense collagen and pigment deposition.

        "C": "Chrysolite",
        "D": "Erionite"
      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: B) Amphibole Explanation: Amphibole (crocidolite, amosite) is the most toxic form of asbestos. Asbestos is a family of crystalline hydrated silicates associated with pulmonary fibrosis and various forms of cancer. It occurs in two distinct geometric forms: serpentine and amphibole. Amphiboles are straight and stiffly aligned with the airstream and can be delivered deeper into the lungs. They can penetrate epithelial cells and reach the interstitium. Chrysolites, with their more flexible, curled structure, are likely to become impacted in the upper respiratory passages and removed by the mucociliary elevator. Even if they get trapped in the lungs, they are easily removed as they are more soluble. Both amphiboles and serpentines are fibrogenic and are associated with a higher incidence of asbestos-related diseases. Serpentine/ Chrysolite Amphibole/ Crocidolite/ Amosite Wavy Rigid More common (90% of the asbestos) More pathogenic (amphiboles particularly associated with mesothelioma ) Mnemonic: I am crying (Chrysotile) After looking at a snake (Serpentine) Snake is wavy Snakes can be seen more commonly (more common) Mnemonic: I am on a site (Amosite) Saw a Crocodile (Crocidolite) Which is an Amphibian Crocodile is straight (rigid) Erionite is a naturally occurring fibrous mineral with properties similar to asbestos. Exposure to it is associated with increased risks of lung cancer and mesothelioma. Reference: Robbins and Cotran, Pathologic Basis of Disease, 10th edition, Page 694",

      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: B) Adenocarcinoma Explanation: The patient's occupational history where he worked as a Shipbuilder suggests that he was chronically exposed to Asbestos and the most common lung malignancy seen with occupational asbestos exposure is adenocarcinoma. Asbestos exposure is a well-established risk factor for developing laryngeal, ovarian, colon, lung and pleural cancers. Asbestos-related lung carcinoma is markedly magnified by smoking. Thus, asbestos workers (particularly those who smoke) are at much higher risk of dying of lung carcinoma than mesothelioma. Compared to other occupational lung diseases which affect the upper lobes of the lungs, it commonly affects the lower lobes. Adenocarcinoma (primary bronchogenic carcinoma ) is the most common type of cancer that accounts for about 45%, followed by squamous cell carcinoma. (Option A) Lung mesothelioma is a more specific tumour associated with asbestos exposure. It is common but is less prevalent than Adenocarcinoma. (Option C) In contrast to bronchogenic carcinoma, the risk of mesothelioma does not increase with smoking in patients with asbestos.",

Non-caseating granuloma. Explanation : Byssinosis: Cotton dust/ organic dust exposure. The patient usually complains that the symptoms worsen when they come to work on Monday, hence the name Monday disease. They get better when off work, and symptoms reduce as the week progresses. This cycle is repeated. Bagassosis is caused by inhaling the fibrous cane-sugar residue called bagasse. It occurs in those working with bagasse, such as those in wallboard or paper manufacturing, but is not seen in sugar industry workers. Siderosis is due to exposure to iron oxide in welders. Berylliosis is caused by beryllium exposure. It leads to non-caseating granulomas, as in sarcoidosis and can be differentiated based on industry exposure. Stannosis - Tin/ Lead exposure. Baritosis - Barium exposure.

      "explanation": "Correct Answer : C) Leads to mediastinal shift Explanation: Mesothelioma A rare cancer arising from mesothelial cells that most commonly affects the pleura. It can also affect the peritoneum, pericardium and tunica vaginalis. Aetiology Asbestos: Mesothelioma is the most specific asbestos-associated cancer (Option A) It is not associated with smoking (Option D) Pathology Advanced pleural mesothelioma can cause extensive pleural fibrosis and thickening, making the affected side rigid and immobile. Later stages fix the mediastinum in place due to pleural thickening and fibrosis. The mediastinal shift is not a characteristic feature of mesothelioma. M/C cytogenetic abnormality in mesothelioma: Homozygous deletion of chromosome 9p , leading to loss of tumour suppressor gene- CDKN2A. Clinical features Progressive dyspnea, chest pain, weight loss, chronic cough, hemoptysis. Decreased breath sounds and dullness to percussion (due to pleural effusion or thickening). Diagnosis CT scan: Pleural thickening, effusion, or frozen hemithorax (not causing a mediastinal shift in the presence of effusion) (Options C and D) Confirmed by biopsy: Epithelioid mesothelioma shows tubules, nests, or papillary structures with uniform round to oval nuclei and eosinophilic cytoplasm. Sarcomatoid mesothelioma consists of spindle-shaped cells resembling fibrosarcoma. Biphasic mesothelioma displays a mixture of both patterns. Specific markers for mesothelioma: Calretinin.
