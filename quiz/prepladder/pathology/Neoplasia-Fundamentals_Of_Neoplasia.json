      "explanation": "its associated malignancy is NRAS-melanoma. RAS proteins are associated with small G proteins. They flip back and forth between an excited signal-transmitting state(bound to GTP) and a silent state (bound to GDP). Stimulation of receptor tyrosine kinases by growth factors leads to an exchange of GDP for GTP. This activates RAS, which is transient because of an intrinsic GTPase activity that is accelerated by GTPase-activating proteins (GAPs) Many subtypes of RAS are associated with malignancies.

      "question": "A 9-year-old child presents with multiple freckle-like dark spots on sun-exposed areas such as the face and arms. The child complains of discomfort and pain upon exposure to sunlight, and there is evidence of sunburn even after brief periods outdoors. Upon further questioning, they reveal a family history of skin cancer in relatives who also experienced similar skin issues from a young age.

        "D": "Bloom syndrome, defective homologous repair"
      },
      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "The clinical presentation is suggestive of xeroderma pigmentosum, caused due to defective DNA nucleotide excision repair (Option 1). Xeroderma pigmentosum (XP): It is an autosomal recessive disorder characterized by sun sensitivity, with approximately 50% of patients having acute burning on minimal sun exposure. UV radiation causes the cross-linking of pyrimidine residues , preventing normal DNA replication. Nucleotide excision repair (NER) prevents this DNA damage. Inherited loss-of-function mutations in any of these genes give rise to xeroderma pigmentosum. The onset of freckling (lentigines) on sun-exposed skin before age two years in most patients. At an early age, there is a significantly increased risk of sunlight-induced cutaneous neoplasms (basal cell carcinoma, squamous cell carcinoma, melanoma) . Cockyane syndrome is an autosomal recessive disorder characterised by a defect in nucleotide excision repair . But unlike XP, there is no increased incidence of neoplasia ( Option 2). Bloom syndrome is an autosomal recessive disorder caused by loss-of-function mutations in a helicase required for homologous recombination repair (Option 4).

      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "CORRECT ANSWER: B) Fanconi anemia EXPLANATION: Fanconi anaemia is associated with a defect in homologous DNA repair. Fanconi anemia: It is an autosomal recessive disorder due to failure to repair double stranded DNA breaks (cauesd by UV lights) due to defective homologous repair (due to mutation in multiple genes). It is characterised by: Developmental abnormalities (short stature, skeletal abnormalities). Hypersensitivity to chemotherapeutic agents that cross-link DNA. Increased risk of bone marrow failure (aplasia) and leukaemia. Other diseases associated with a defect in homologous DNA repair: Bloom syndrome. Ataxia telangiectasia. Familial breast cancer (mutations in BRCA 1 and BRCA 2). Werner syndrome. Rothmund-Thomson syndrome. Trichothiodystrophy (Option A): Trichothiodystrophy (TTD) is a rare autosomal recessive multisystem disorder characterised by defect in the TC-NER pathway (Transcription coupled- nucleotide excision repair pathway). Endometrial carcinoma (Option C): Certain subsets of endometrial cancer (most often) and colon cancer harbour mutations in DNA polymerase that result in a loss of proofreading function and the accumulation of numerous point substitutions. Wermer syndrome (Option D) : Wermer syndrome, also known as multiple endocrine neoplasia 1 (MEN 1) is characterised by tumors of: Parathyroid (adenoma). Pancreas (M/C- gastrinoma). Pituitary adenoma (M/C- prolactinoma). Reference: Robbins and Cotran, Pathologic Basis of Disease, 10th edition, Page no. 314,315 Fitzpatrick’s Dermatology, 9th edition, Page no. 2345",

        "B": "It is also known as hereditary breast and ovarian cancer syndrome.",

        "D": "Amsterdam II criteria are used for diagnosis."
      },
      "correct_answer": "D",
      "explanation": "CORRECT ANSWER: D) Amsterdam II criteria are used for diagnosis. EXPLANATION: Amsterdam II criteria are used for the diagnosis of Lynch syndrome (Hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal cancer). (Option B) Three or more relatives with Lynch syndrome-associated cancers (colorectal, endometrial, ovarian, stomach, small bowel, ureter, or renal pelvis cancer). At least one affected relative is a first-degree relative of the others. Two successive generations are affected. One or more relatives are diagnosed with Lynch syndrome-associated cancer before age 50. FAP excluded. Lynch syndrome (Hereditary polyposis non-colorectal cancer): It is an autosomal dominant disorder associated with carcinomas that arise predominantly in the cecum and proximal colon. (Option A) Individuals with HNPCC syndrome inherit one abnormal copy of a mismatch repair gene. (Option C) Trouble arises when cells acquire somatic loss of- function mutations, presumably at random, in their single normal alleles. Germline loss-of-function mutations in at least four different genes can produce HNPCC syndrome. The most commonly affected genes are MSH2 and MLH1 , each accounting for approximately 30% of HNPCC syndrome. Microsatellite instability is also observed in about 15% of sporadic colon cancers and less frequently in many other cancer types. In sporadic cancers, defects in mismatch repair usually stem from epigenetic silencing of the MLH1 gene rather than somatic mutations. Lynch syndrome is the only autosomal dominant defective DNA repair disease (all other defective DNA repair diseases are autosomal recessive in inheritance).

        "D": "It is characterised by decreased glucose uptake and utilisation by cancer cells."
      },
      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "glucose via glycolysis, even in the presence of oxygen. CORRECT ANSWER: C) Cancer cells exhibit increased glucose uptake and preferentially metabolise glucose via glycolysis, even in the presence of oxygen. EXPLANATION: A unique metabolic characteristic seen in cancer cells is the Warburg effect. Warburg effect: Even in the presence of ample oxygen, cancer cells demonstrate a distinctive form of cellular metabolism characterised by high glucose uptake levels and increased glucose conversion to lactose (fermentation) via glycolysis (Option D) Otto Warburg was awarded the Nobel Prize in 1931 for this theory. Even though ATP production is low with lactate formation compared to mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation, it provides metabolic intermediates needed for synthesising cellular components. Warburg effect is the basis of positive emission tomography (PET). Patients are injected with 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) , a non-metabolizable glucose derivative preferentially taken up into tumour cells (due to glucose hunger), which can be detected by PET scan. Cancer cells primarily rely on oxidative phosphorylation for ATP production (Option A), which is not true, as cancer cells prefer glycolysis, even in the presence of oxygen. It involves a shift from glycolysis to oxidative phosphorylation in cancer cells (Option B), which is incorrect because the Warburg effect involves the opposite: a shift toward glycolysis. It is characterized by decreased glucose uptake and utilization by cancer cells (Option D) is inaccurate, as cancer cells actually increase glucose uptake and metabolism via glycolysis.

      },
      "correct_answer": "D",
      "explanation": "CORRECT ANSWER: D) Enhanced antigen presentation to promote T cell activation immune system. Antigen presentation is a crucial step in activating T cells and initiating an immune response against tumour cells. Antigen-presenting cells, such as dendritic cells, present tumor antigens to T cells via major histocompatibility complex (MHC) molecules, leading to T cell activation and anti-tumour immune responses. While tumour cells may downregulate or alter the expression of MHC molecules to evade immune recognition, enhancing antigen presentation to promote T-cell activation is not a typical strategy employed by tumour cells for immune evasion. Mechanisms by which tumour cells evade the host immune system: Selective outgrowth of the antigen-negative variants (Option A). Reduced expression of MHC molecules (Option B). Secretion of immunosuppressive factors (Option C). Engagement of pathways that inhibit T-cell activation. Immune checkpoint inhibitors have been developed that inhibit CTLA-4, PD-1, and PD-L1.
