      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: A) Factor deficiency Explanation: Mixing studies are done when there's a prolonged aPTT with normal BT and PT. This could be due to factor deficiency, like Factor VIII deficiency (hemophilia), or increased antibodies, as seen in Anti-phospholipid antibody syndrome (APLA), including lupus anticoagulant (LAC). Platelet dysfunction(Option B) Platelet dysfunction typically presents with symptoms such as easy bruising and recurrent nosebleeds. However, a prolonged aPTT typically indicates a defect in the coagulation cascade rather than platelet dysfunction. Vitamin K deficiency(Option D) vitamin K is crucial for synthesizing coagulation factors II, VII, IX, and X. Its deficiency can lead to prolonged PT and aPTT. However, in this case, the aPTT corrects after mixing with normal plasma, indicating that clotting factors are present. Hence, vitamin K deficiency is less likely.

      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: B) K time is more in stage 2 Explanation: K time is more in stage 2 of DIC due to the increased time for the clot to reach firmness, as there is fibrinogen dysfunction in this stage. Stages of DIC: Stage 1- Hypercoagulable state with multiple clots being formed in vessels throughout the body. The graph shows decreased R time (Option A) , decreased K time, higher maximum amplitude (Option C) , and higher LY30 from subsequent fibrinolysis.

      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: B) No platelet aggregation Explanation: The decrease in light transmission observed during platelet aggregometry indicates no platelet aggregation. This test measures platelet adhesion, secretion, and aggregation by passing light through platelet-rich plasma. Initially, light transmission is reduced as the cells are dispersed through plasma. Upon the addition of agonists like ristocetin, ADP, epinephrine, and collagen, platelet aggregation occurs, creating clots that allow light to transmit (Option A). Therefore, a decrease in light transmission signifies the absence of platelet aggregates. (Option B) Serum sodium (Option C): Serum sodium levels are not directly assessed or measured during platelet aggregometry. Increase in plasma fibrinogen (Option D): Platelet aggregometry primarily assesses platelet function and aggregation, not plasma fibrinogen levels. Therefore, a decrease in light transmission during the test is unrelated to increased plasma fibrinogen. Reference: Platelet aggregometry",

      "explanation": "Correct Answer: A) PT and APTT are normal Explanation: This 35-year-old mother just delivered one day ago and is now having symptoms of Disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) . DIC is classified as an acute, subacute, or chronic thrombo-hemorrhagic illness characterized by excessive coagulation activation and microvascular thrombi formation. Common causes include sepsis, significant trauma, malignant neoplasms, and complications during pregnancy. Acute promyelocytic leukemia (AML M3) and adenocarcinomas of the stomach, colon, pancreas, and lung are frequently associated with DIC. (Option B) DIC is triggered by two main mechanisms: Extensive endothelial cell damage and Release of tissue factor or other procoagulants into the bloodstream. Additionally, widespread endothelial damage can result from the deposition of antigen-antibody complexes, extremes in temperature, or infections like meningococci and rickettsiae (Option D). Signs and symptoms of DIC may include hemorrhage due to depleted hemostatic components, tissue hypoxia, and infarction due to microthrombi, or both. Diagnosis: ↓ platelet count, ↓ fibrinogen levels; ↑ PT, ↑ aPTT, and ↑ fibrin breakdown products, especially D-dimers (Option C).

      "explanation": "Correct Answer: A) Bleeding Time (BT) Explanation: The symptoms described—frequent nosebleeds, heavy menstrual periods, prolonged bleeding after minor cuts, and easy bruising—are characteristic of a primary hemostasis disorder, which involves platelet function. The Bleeding Time (BT) test assesses the function of platelets and their ability to form a primary hemostatic plug. Normal BT is 2 to 9 minutes and is prolonged when there is a defect in platelet function. Clotting time (CT) (Option B): The clotting time (CT) reflects the time needed for clot formation rather than platelet function. Normal CT: 8-15 mins. Prothrombin time (PT) (Option C): Prothrombin time is used to assess both extrinsic and common coagulation pathways. Deficits or dysfunctions of factors 1, 2, 5, 7, or 10 can cause a prolonged prothrombin time (PT). Normal PT: 11-16 secs. INR = PT of patient / PT of a normal person. Activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) (Option D): Activated partial prothrombin time is used to study intrinsic and common coagulation processes. Normal aPTT: 25-30 secs. Deficits or dysfunctions of factors 12, 11, 9, 8, 10, 5, 2, 1 or interfering antiphospholipid antibodies can all prolong the aPTT.

      "question": "A 2-week-old male infant is brought to the pediatrician by his parents because of prolonged bleeding from the umbilical stump. The parents report that the bleeding started soon after the umbilical cord fell off and has not stopped despite applying pressure. Laboratory tests show normal Prothrombin Time (PT), Activated Partial Thromboplastin Time (aPTT), and platelet count. Which of the following deficiencies is most likely causing the prolonged bleeding?",
      "options": {
        "A": "Factor VIII",
        "B": "Factor XIII",
        "C": "Factor IV",
        "D": "Factor IX"
      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: B) Factor XIII Explanation: Factor XIII is crucial for maintaining clot stability and promoting fibrin polymer cross-linking, ensuring effective hemostasis. Its deficiency can lead to prolonged bleeding from the umbilical stump in neonates, as seen in this case. Other symptoms include severe menstrual bleeding, hemarthrosis, repeated early pregnancy loss, and delayed postoperative bleeding. Unlike other factors, Factor XIII deficiency does not affect BT, CT, PT, aPTT, or platelet count. Diagnosis is confirmed with a urea clot solubility test, in which the clot dissolves if Factor XIII is deficient. Factor VIII deficiency (Option A): Hemophilia A, or Factor VIII deficiency is an X-linked disorder, characterized by elevated aPTT and causes deep tissue and joint bleeding. Von Willebrand factor (vWF) protects Factor VIII from degradation, and its deficiency can lead to reduced Factor VIII levels, resulting in a condition called pseudohemophilia. Factor IV deficiency (Option C): Factor IV (calcium) is essential for the coagulation cascade, activating Factor X in intrinsic and extrinsic pathways. However, calcium deficiency is extremely rare and not associated with umbilical stump bleeding; it typically causes widespread bleeding. Factor IX deficiency (Option D): Factor IX deficiency (Hemophilia B or Christmas disease) is an X-linked recessive disorder affecting the intrinsic pathway, causing elevated aPTT with normal PT. Like Hemophilia A, it primarily leads to deep tissue and joint bleeding.",

      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: B)Type 2a Explanation: Von Willebrand disease is the most common inherited bleeding disorder. Clinically and molecularly, von Willebrand disease is heterogeneous, below are 3 identified kinds, each with a variety of phenotypes; vWD type 1 (Option A) vWD Type 2 vWD Type 3 (Option D) Autosomal dominant. The most common type. Mild to moderate vWF deficiency. Quantitative defect. point substitutions prevent the vWF protein from maturing or cause it to leave the plasma quickly Autosomal dominant. Qualitative defect. Types: 2A, 2B, 2M, 2N 2A (Most common) - Decrease in binding between vWF and Gp1b/9 (Option B) missense mutations cause faulty multimer formation → the most active forms of vWF, i.e. large- and intermediate-sized multimers are absent. 2B - Increase in binding between vWF and Gp1b/9 (Option C) 2M - VWF dependant platelet adhesion is decreased. There is impairment of VWF binding to platelets. Type 2M VWD typically has mild to moderate mucocutaneous bleeding 2N - There is marked decline in the binding affinity for factor VIII. The level of factor VIII is lower when compared to the VWF:Ag. This led to misdiagnosis as haemophilia A Autosomal recessive . Quantitative defect. produced by frameshift mutations or deletions affecting both alleles (autosomal recessive), which produce little or no vWF. Factor VIII levels are also lowered because vWF stabilizes factor VIII in the blood, and the resulting bleeding condition is severe.

      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: A) Gp1b-IX Explanation: Gp1b-IX is a membrane complex in platelets that facilitates binding to the von Willebrand Factor, which is defective/deficient in von Willebrand disease. gpIIb-IIIa (Option B): This glycoprotein complex is crucial for platelet aggregation, the final step in primary hemostasis. It binds fibrinogen and von Willebrand factor (vWF), aiding in the formation of platelet plugs. However, defects in gpIIb-IIIa are not associated with von Willebrand Disease (vWD). Factor IX (Option C): Factor IX (or Christmas factor) is a vitamin K-dependent clotting factor, part of the intrinsic clotting pathway. Factor IX deficiency is known as Hemophilia B, an X-linked recessive disorder. Factor XIII (Option D): Factor XIII stabilises fibrin by cross linking and deficiency leads to severe bleeding.
