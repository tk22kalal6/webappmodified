      },
      "correct_answer": "D",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: D) Has a lag phase between exposure and response. Explanation: The lag phase between exposure and response is not a feature of innate immunity as it acts rapidly against pathogens. The lag phase is a feature of adaptive immunity. It specifically targets the pathogen causing infection, so it first needs to recognize the pathogen. This means that it’s slower to respond than the innate immune system, but it’s more accurate when it does respond. Because of immunological memory, the next time it faces the same pathogen, there is a quick and robust response. Innate immunity is the body's first line of defense against pathogens, present since birth. It responds similarly to all germs and foreign substances, hence the term non-specific immune system. Difference between innate and acquired immunity Innate/native immunity Acquired/adaptive immunity Present since birth (Option A) Occurs after exposure to the pathogen Quick, non-specific response (Option C) Slower, specific response to a pathogen No immunological memory Has immunological memory Examples include : Epithelial barriers like skin, GIT. (Option B) Plasma proteins like C-reactive protein. Neutrophils, macrophages, dendritic cells, complement. Cells are of 2 types : B lymphocytes: Provides humoral immunity and produces antibodies 2.

      "question": "A 45-year-old male presents with a fever, sore throat, and swollen lymph nodes. He is diagnosed with a viral infection. Which of the following cells is most likely involved in the early defense against the offending agent in this patient?",
      "options": {
        "A": "NK cells",
        "B": "T cells",

      },
      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: A) NK cells Explanation: In this scenario, the patient has a viral infection, and the body's initial defense mechanism against the virus is Natural Killer (NK) cells. Natural Killer cell (NK) : Produced by a large granular lymphocyte. Constitutes 5 to 10% of circulating blood lymphocytes. Function: It can be part of both innate and adaptive immunity. Innate immunity: Directly kill the virus-infected cells or tumour cells. Adaptive immunity: Antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity. Popular markers for NK cells: CD 16 and CD 56. CD 56: The role is still not fully understood. CD 16: Detect and bind to Fc fragment of IgG on target cells and kill the cell by perforins and by releasing toxins and granzymes. Nk cells have 2 different kinds of receptors. Activating receptors: NKG2D. Inhibitory receptors: CD94, CD 96 (these prevent self-cells from being attacked by NK cells). Cytokines produced by Nk cells : IFN-Y: (Cytokine majorly responsible for granuloma formation). This cytokine leads to the activation of macrophages to epithelioid cells. Cytokines responsible for the proliferation of NK cells: IL-2 and IL-15. T cells ( Option B) are important in the adaptive immune response against viruses, they are not typically involved in the body's immediate defense mechanism during the early stages of infection. Macrophages and Histiocytes (Option C & D) are part of the innate immune system and play a role in the immune response to viral infections. However, NK cells are more directly involved in the early defence against viruses due to their ability to recognize and kill virus-infected cells without prior sensitization.",

      },
      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: C) Langerhans cells Explanation: The given clinical scenario describes the Mantoux test. Langerhans cells are specialized dendritic cells found in the skin and mucosa. They are responsible for antigen presentation in the immune system. They are part of the body's first line of defense and belong to the innate immune system. Dendritic cells(DC) are the most potent antigen-presenting cells(APC) for initiating T-cell responses against protein antigens. Types of APCs Description Professional APCs These are further divided into Dendritic cells B cells Macrophages These dendritic cells are present in two regions Skin: They are called as Langerhans cells Lymph node: Follicular dendritic cells (reservoirs for HIV) (Langhans cells are not antigen-presenting cells, these are the giant cells generally found in TB). Non-professional APCs It includes Thymic epithelial cells Endothelial cells Fibroblasts Dendritic cell properties: They have many cytoplasmic processes resembling dendrites and receptors that sense microbes and cell damage that stimulate the secretion of cytokines. This has a critical role in inflammation and antiviral defense. They express receptors for capturing antigens, including TLRs and lectins. They are located under the epithelia and interstitia of all tissues, which are common sites for capturing antigens. They have a higher concentration of MHCs and are present in greater numbers in the epidermis than other APCs. Immature DCs within the epidermis are called Langerhans cells. Langhans cells/Langhans giant cells (Option A) are multinucleated giant cells found in granulomas. They consist of huge cytoplasm and multiple nuclei that are derived from the fusion of multiple activated macrophages. Follicular dendritic cells (Option B) are specialized cells found in lymphoid follicles within lymph nodes and the spleen. They play a crucial role in presenting antigens to B cells and are involved in the formation and maintenance of the germinal center reaction. NK cells (Option D) are not APCs. They destroy abnormal cells, such as virus-infected or malignant cells.",

      "explanation": "Correct Answer: D) Spleen Explanation: In the immune response to toxin-producing strains of E. coli causing UTI, blood-borne antigens are primarily trapped and processed in the spleen. The spleen is an important secondary lymphoid organ where circulating antigens, including those derived from bacteria and their toxins, are captured by specialized cells such as macrophages. These antigens are then presented to immune cells, initiating an immune response to neutralize the toxins and clear the infection. The spleen is part of the secondary lymphoid organs, including lymph nodes and mucosal/cutaneous lymphoid tissues. They are a part of adaptive immunity. In contrast, primary lymphoid organs like the thymus and bone marrow are involved in the development and maturation of immune cells (T and B lymphocytes).

        "D": "Non-MHC-dependent antigen presentation"
      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: B) Class II Explanation: In a patient with typhoid infection (caused by Salmonella typhi), antigen presentation primarily involves MHC class II molecules, which present antigens derived from extracellular pathogens to activate an immune response. Class I MHC class I molecules present endogenous antigens derived from intracellular pathogens, such as viruses and some bacteria. Class II MHC class II molecules present exogenous antigens derived from extracellular pathogens, such as Salmonella typhi, the bacterium responsible for typhoid fever. Class III MHC class III molecules are not involved in antigen presentation. They encode components of the complement system and other immune-related molecules. Non-MHC-dependent antigen presentation While non-MHC-dependent antigen presentation can occur through mechanisms like CD1 molecules presenting lipid antigens. Class II MHC molecules are expressed on the surface of antigen-presenting cells (APCs), such as dendritic cells, macrophages, and B cells. These cells process exogenous antigens derived from extracellular microbes and proteins after internalization into endosomes or lysosomes. The internalized proteins are broken down into peptides and associated with class II MHC in the vesicles and transported to the cell surface as stable peptide-MHC complexes. The class II-peptide complex is recognized by CD4+/helper T cells. Class II MHC molecules present antigens derived from extracellular pathogens to CD4+ helper T cells, initiating an immune response.

      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: B) MHC 1 - alpha 1 and 2; MHC 2 - alpha 1 and beta 1 Explanation: In MHC class I molecules, the alpha 1 and beta 1 domains together form the antigen-binding site, which binds to peptides derived from intracellular proteins. MHC-1 molecules are expressed on all nucleated cells, antigen-presenting cells, and platelets Mature RBCs that lack a nucleus don't express MHC-1 They are heterodimers with a polymorphic α or heavy chain linked non-covalently to a smaller β 2-microglobulin. The antigen is bound within a groove between the α 1 and α 2 domains of the alpha chain. This, along with the β 2-microglobulin, forms a stable complex to be displayed on the cell surface. In MHC class II molecules, similar to MHC class I, the antigen-binding site is also formed by the alpha 1 and beta 1 domains, binding peptides derived from extracellular proteins presented by antigen-presenting cells. They consist of 2 alpha and 2 beta chains of equal length. The invariant chain is a protein structure associated with MHC-2. It is associated with MHC-2 within endosomes to prevent the binding of endogenous antigens. The invariant chain is later broken down, while MHC-2 is moved to the cell surface.",

      },
      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: A) IgG Explanation: The given clinical scenario describes Hemolytic disease of the newborn (HDN), also known as erythroblastosis fetalis, occurs when there is an incompatibility between the blood types of a mother and her fetus. This condition is often caused by Rh (Rhesus) blood group incompatibility, where the mother is Rh-negative and the fetus is Rh-positive. During pregnancy, maternal antibodies of the IgG class against the Rh antigen can cross the placenta and attack the fetal red blood cells (RBCs), leading to hemolysis (destruction of RBCs) in the fetus. This results in various degrees of anaemia and potentially severe complications for the newborn. This crossing is facilitated by active transplacental transfer mechanisms, primarily mediated by syncytiotrophoblast cells expressing neonatal Fc receptors (FcRn). These receptors interact with the Fc domain of IgG, permitting their transfer. This phenomenon is also responsible for newborns' passive immunity, with IgG being the most abundant antibody in their circulation. IgM (Option A) are multinucleated giant cells found in granulomas. They consist of huge cytoplasm and multiple nuclei that are derived from the fusion of multiple activated macrophages. It cannot cross the placenta due to its large size (pentameric structure). IgD and IgE (Option C and D) are also incapable of crossing the placenta. Reference: https://www.uptodate.com/contents/rhd-alloimmunization-in-pregnancy-overview",
