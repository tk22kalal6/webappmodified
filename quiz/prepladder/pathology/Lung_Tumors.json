      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: A) Horner syndrome Explanation: The patient's presentation and the presence of a lung apex mass involving nearby neurovascular structures suggests a Pancoast tumour (superior sulcus tumour) located at the apex of the lung, typically involving nearby neurovascular structures. Compression or invasion of nearby nerves, including the sympathetic chain, can result in Horner syndrome, characterised by a combination of ptosis (drooping eyelid), miosis (constricted pupil), and anhidrosis (lack of sweating) on the affected side of the face and sometimes enophthalmos (sunken appearance of the eyeball). Superior vena cava syndrome (Option B): SVC syndrome is characterised by symptoms related to compression or obstruction of the superior vena cava, typically by a tumour in the mediastinum leading to facial swelling, dilated veins, and other signs of venous congestion but not neurological manifestations. Caplan syndrome (Option C): Caplan syndrome is the combination of rheumatoid arthritis and pneumoconiosis (Coal workers' pneumoconiosis) with characteristic pulmonary nodules . It is not associated with any neurological symptoms. Carcinoid syndrome (Option D): Carcinoid syndrome is associated with symptoms such as flushing, diarrhoea, and wheezing due to the release of vasoactive substances from carcinoid tumours, and it has no association with neurological manifestations.

      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: A) CD34 Explanation: CD34 is a marker often expressed in solitary fibrous tumours. It is most useful for identifying solitary fibrous tumours due to its high rate of positivity in SFT and its absence in mesothelioma. Characteristic Solitary Fibrous Tumor (SFT) Malignant Mesothelioma Nature of the tumour Mostly benign, rare malignant Malignant Histopathology Dense fibrous tissue, spindle cells, occasional cysts Diffuse, invasive tumour growth across the pleural surface Immunohistochemistry Positive for CD34 and STAT6. Negative for Keratin. Positive for Calretinin, WT1, cytokeratin 5/6, and podoplanin. Morphology Tumours, often pedunculated and attached to the pleural surface, may have a whorled appearance. Thick, firm, gelatinous tissue ensheathing the lung; often extensive effusion. Microscopic appearance Spindle cells are arranged in whorls among reticulin and collagen fibres. Variable : Epithelioid (tubular/papillary structures), sarcomatoid (fibrosarcoma-like), or biphasic Calretinin (Option B): Calretinin is a calcium-binding protein commonly used as a marker for mesothelioma. It is typically expressed in the epithelial and some biphasic types of mesothelioma but is not usually expressed in solitary fibrous tumours . WT1 (Wilms' tumour 1) (Option C): WT1 is another frequently positive marker in mesothelioma, particularly in epithelial mesothelioma. This marker, however, is not usually expressed in solitary fibrous tumours. TTF-1 (Thyroid transcription factor 1) (Option D): TTF-1 is primarily used to identify carcinoma of lung and thyroid origin and is not useful for distinguishing between solitary fibrous tumours and mesothelioma. TTF-1 is positive in the adenocarcinoma of the lung.",

      "explanation": "Correct Answer: C) Kulchitsky cells Explanation: The clinical scenario, along with biopsy features, suggest a Carcinoid tumour , a neuroendocrine tumour arising from Kulchitsky cells (Neuroendocrine cells) within the bronchial epithelium. These cells produce and secrete bioactive substances such as serotonin (5-HT) and other peptides that can influence smooth muscle contraction, immune responses, and other physiological processes. Type II pneumocytes (Option A): Type II pneumocytes are surfactant-producing cells in the alveoli and are associated with adenocarcinoma rather than carcinoid tumours. Clara cells (Option B): Clara cells are non-ciliated cells found in the bronchioles and are not involved in the origin of bronchial carcinoid tumours. These cells secrete proteins and lipids that maintain and protect the airway epithelium. Alveolar macrophages (Option D): Alveolar macrophages are immune cells responsible for phagocytosis within the alveoli and are not related to the development of carcinoid tumours.

      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: B) Smoking has no association with adenocarcinoma of the lung. Explanation: Smoking significantly increases the risk of adenocarcinoma of the lung, although to a lesser extent than other types. Adenocarcinoma, commonly found in non-smokers, can still occur due to tobacco smoking. It often involves mutations in growth factor receptor pathways and is the most prevalent subtype in non-smokers. Smoking is a major risk factor for squamous cell carcinoma of the lung (Option A): Smoking significantly increases the risk of squamous cell carcinoma of the lung as it has a strong association, resulting in chromosomal deletions involving tumour suppressor loci involving 3p,9p and 17p. Smoking is a significant risk factor for small-cell lung carcinoma (Option C): Small-cell carcinoma is almost always linked to smoking, exhibiting the highest mutation rate among lung cancers. SCLC is almost exclusively caused by smoking and usually involves the inactivation of both TP53 and RB genes. Asbestosis exposure, along with smoking, multiplies the risk of lung cancer (Option D): Asbestos exposure, especially when combined with smoking, significantly raises the risk of lung cancer . Non-smokers exposed to asbestos have a five-fold higher risk, while smokers have a 55-fold increased risk compared to non-smokers.

Physical examination shows tachypnea, hypoxia, and diffuse crackles on chest auscultation. Chest X-ray reveals bilateral opacities suggestive of pulmonary oedema. Histopathological examination of lung biopsy shows congested, edematous lungs with inflammation. Which histopathological finding is characteristic of the acute exudative stage in this patient's lung injury?",
      "options": {
        "A": "Proliferation of type II pneumocytes",
        "B": "Formation of fibrotic thickening in the alveolar septa",
        "C": "Presence of waxy hyaline membranes lining the alveolar walls",
        "D": "Resolution of granulation tissue in the alveolar spaces"
      },
      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: C) Presence of waxy hyaline membranes lining the alveolar walls Explanation: In the acute exudative stage of lung injury, such as acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) triggered by bacterial pneumonia, lungs exhibit characteristic waxy hyaline membranes lining the alveolar walls. These membranes comprise fibrin-rich oedema fluid mixed with remnants of necrotic epithelial cells, representing a hallmark feature of acute lung injury and ARDS. Pathological changes seen in acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) Stage Features 1. Acute Exudative Stage Lungs appear heavy, firm, red, and boggy. Manifestations include congestion, interstitial and intra-alveolar oedema, inflammation, fibrin deposition, and diffuse alveolar damage. Alveolar walls are lined with “waxy hyaline membranes” composed of fibrin-rich oedema fluid mixed with remnants of necrotic epithelial cells. 2. Proliferative or Organizing Stage Proliferation of Type II pneumocytes. Granulation tissue forms in the alveolar walls and spaces. 3. Late Fibrotic Stage Fibrotic thickening of alveolar septa indicates persistent fibrosis and scarring that may develop in some cases of lung injury.",

      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: C) 2 and 4 Explanation: In ARDS, cytokines are released by endothelial cells, not alveolar epithelial cells, and IL-8 causes the recruitment of neutrophils, not lymphocytes. Pathogenesis of non-cardiogenic pulmonary oedema (NCPE) and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS): The hallmark of pathogenesis is ‘endothelial activation’ by bacteria leads to cytokine release, promoting neutrophil adhesion to blood vessels and subsequent endothelial damage. This process results in blood/plasma leakage into the interstitial space and alveoli, causing non-cardiogenic pulmonary oedema (NCPE). Activated macrophages release IL-8 and TNF , recruiting more neutrophils into the alveoli. They also release proteases and free radicals, which damage type 1 and type 2 pneumocytes. This impairs gas exchange and surfactant production, contributing to lung dysfunction.",

      },
      "correct_answer": "D",
      "explanation": "the lumens. Correct Answer: D) Pulmonary arterioles show medial hypertrophy and intimal fibrosis, narrowing the lumens. Explanation: The patient's clinical presentation with symptoms of right heart failure, elevated jugular venous pressure, and findings of right ventricular hypertrophy and dilation on echocardiography suggest pulmonary hypertension. Histopathologically, pulmonary hypertension is characterised by the remodelling of pulmonary arterioles, which typically exhibit medial hypertrophy (thickening of the smooth muscle layer) and intimal fibrosis. These changes lead to the narrowing of the vessel lumens, increased pulmonary vascular resistance, and subsequent right heart strain. BMPR2 mutations result in endothelial and vascular smooth muscle cell apoptosis. (Option A): BMPR2 mutations are associated with familial pulmonary arterial hypertension, commonly associated with dysregulation of endothelial and vascular cellular processes involved in vascular homeostasis, including aberrant proliferation and resistance to apoptosis. Classic atherosclerotic changes are commonly observed in pulmonary arteries. (Option B): Classic atherosclerotic changes, such as plaque formation and lipid deposition, are not typical findings in pulmonary arteries affected by pulmonary hypertension. Plexiform lesions are early changes of pulmonary hypertension. (Option C): Plexiform lesions are characterised by tufts of capillary formations that are more specific to certain types of pulmonary hypertension, particularly in idiopathic and familial cases. Plexiform lesions of small arteries are characteristic of advanced pulmonary hypertension rather than early changes.",
