(suggestive of delayed phase of type 1 HSR). Histamine and tryptase are preformed mediators released by mast cells during the early phase of Type I hypersensitivity (Option B) , not by eosinophils in the late phase. Early phase reaction Late phase reaction Onset Immediate (within minutes of allergen exposure). Delayed (several hours after exposure) and can last for days. Cells involved Mast cells, basophils. Eosinophils, T lymphocytes. Cellular events Activation of mast cells and basophils. Recruitment and activation of leukocytes, especially eosinophils. Mediators Histamine, leukotrienes (LTB4, LTC4, LTD4), prostaglandins (PGD2) and Platelet-activating factor (PAF). Cytokines (e.g., IL-4, IL-5, TNF), chemokines (e.g., eotaxin) Initiating event Exposure to allergen triggers cross-linking of IgE on mast cells/basophils. Recurrent inflammation, sustained by recruited leukocytes. Effect on tissues Vasodilation, increased vascular permeability, smooth muscle contraction. Sustained inflammation and tissue damage due to leukocyte infiltration. Clinical manifestations Allergic rhinitis (hay fever), urticaria (hives), Angioedema bronchoconstriction. Allergic asthma exacerbation, persistent inflammation, and tissue damage. Therapeutic Approach Antihistamines for symptomatic relief.

      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "inflammation and not phagocytosis or cell lysis. Correct Answer: C) When antibodies deposit in intracellular tissues, the injury is due to inflammation and not phagocytosis or cell lysis. Explanation: In pernicious anaemia, the type of hypersensitivity involved is Type II hypersensitivity, also known as antibody-mediated hypersensitivity. This type of hypersensitivity occurs when antibodies bind to antigens on host cells, leading to cell destruction or dysfunction. Mechanisms of Type II hypersensitivity Description Examples Opsonisation and Phagocytosis (Option B) IgG antibodies coat cells, helping phagocytes recognise circulating antigen-opsonin complexes through Fc receptors or complement activation, leading to phagocytosis. Autoimmune hemolytic anaemia Immune thrombocytopenic purpura Rh hemolytic disease of the newborn. Complement activation and inflammation (Option C) Antibody deposition in extracellular tissues triggers inflammation, not phagocytosis or cell lysis. The deposited antibodies activate the complement system, leading to the attraction of neutrophils and monocytes via their Fc receptors. Activated leukocytes release enzymes, resulting in tissue damage. Goodpasture syndrome Acute rheumatic fever Antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) (Option A) Natural killer cells bind to antibody-antigen complexes, inducing apoptotic cell death. Pernicious anemia Insulin resistant diabetes Antibody-mediated cellular dysfunction (non-cytotoxic) (Option D) Antibodies physically impair or dysregulate cellular function by binding to cell surface receptors. This includes both activation (e.g., thyroid hormone receptor in Graves disease) and inhibition (e.g., acetylcholine receptor in Myasthenia gravis).

      "explanation": "Correct Answer: B) Arthus reaction Explanation: The presentation from the given clinical scenario suggests localized immune-complex mediated hypersensitivity or Type III hypersensitivity reaction. The “Arthus reaction” is localized tissue necrosis caused by acute immune complex vasculitis, often occurring in the skin. It occurs when pre-existing antibodies (IgG) interact with antigens locally injected into the skin or other tissues, leading to complement activation, inflammation, and tissue damage. This reaction is typically seen in response to repeated exposure to certain antigens (e.g., vaccines) and results in a localised inflammatory response such as localised swelling, redness, pain, and tissue destruction. Systemic type III hypersensitivity Localised type III hypersensitivity Involves the widespread formation of immune complexes in circulation and can deposit in various tissues and organs throughout the body, including the kidneys (leading to glomerulonephritis), joints, skin, blood vessels, and other sites. (e.g., in chronic infections or autoimmune diseases). Immune complexes are deposited at specific sites of antigen exposure, such as the skin (as in the Arthus reaction) or joint spaces, leading to local inflammation (localized swelling, redness, pain) and tissue damage.

      "explanation": "→ Deposition in tissues → Inflammation and tissue injury. Correct answer: C) Formation of immune complexes → Deposition in tissues → Inflammation and tissue injury. Explanation: Phases of Type 3 hypersensitivity: 1. Formation of Immune Complexes : After introducing a protein antigen, antibodies are formed (typically within one week) and react with the antigen in circulation, creating antigen-antibody complexes. 2. Deposition of Immune Complexes : These complexes circulate and are deposited in blood vessels, particularly in organs like the kidneys and joints. Medium-sized complexes formed in slight antigen excess are most pathogenic. 3. Inflammation and Tissue Injury: Deposited immune complexes trigger acute inflammation about 10 days post-antigen exposure, leading to symptoms like fever, joint pain, and proteinuria. Complement activation contributes to tissue injury, with serum C3 levels potentially serving as a marker for disease activity.
