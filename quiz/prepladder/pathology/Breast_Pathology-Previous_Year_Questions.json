        "C": "Ductal ectasia",
        "D": "Sclerosing adenosis"
      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: B) Fibroadenoma Explanation: The clinical presentation along with histopathology showing epithelial ducts compressed and distorted by surrounding stroma, is characteristic of an intracanalicular Fibroadenoma. Fibroadenoma Definition Benign tumours arising from the proliferation of glandular tissue in the breast Prevalence Most common in women aged 15-25 years. Aetiology Believed to be influenced by hormonal fluctuations during reproductive years Molecular alteration: Alterations in MED12 gene. Clinical Presentation Painless, firm, rubbery, and mobile lumps Described as feeling like a \"marble in the breast.\" Histopathology Well-defined borders due to a fibrous capsule, with proliferating stroma potentially compressing and distorting glandular components. The epithelium may be of 2 patterns: Pericanalicular Pattern: Surrounded by stroma Intracanalicular Pattern: Compressed and distorted by it. Mammogram Popcorn calcification on mammogram Diagnosis Triple Assessment: Clinical examination, radiological imaging (ultrasound), tissue sampling (core-needle biopsy) Ultrasound: Helps distinguish fibroadenomas from cysts Core-Needle Biopsy: Provides",

      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: A) ER+ / HER2 neu- ; mild to moderate proliferation Explanation: Luminal type A tumours refer to a subtype of breast cancer with ER-positive, HER2 neu negative and mild to moderate proliferation. These tumours tend to grow slowly and have a better prognosis compared to other subtypes. Molecular classification of breast cancer is based on the results of receptor status such as ER, PR and HER2. Molecular classification of breast cancer Classification Hormone receptor HER2/Neu Others Luminal A Positive (either or both ER/PR) Negative Ki-67 low (mild to moderate proliferation) Luminal B (Options A & D ruled out) Positive (either or both ER/PR) Negative/ positive Ki-67 high (high proliferation) Basal type (triple -ve) (Option C ruled out) Negative Negative Ki-67 usually high HER2/neu enriched Negative Positive Ki-67 high Claudin low Negative Negative Claudin low Reference: Robbins and Cotran Pathologic Basis of Disease, 10th Edition, Pages 1049, 1056-1058",

      "explanation": "terminal duct lobular units and develops only in the female breast. It is mostly multicentric and bilateral Increased risk of cancer is in both breasts Calcifications associated with Invasive lobular carcinoma typically occur in adjacent tissues (neighborhood calcification) The histologic hallmark of Invasive lobular carcinoma is the tendency of tumor cells to invade in linear strands (Indian file pattern) Incorrect Options: Option A - Phyllodes tumor: It is mostly a benign tumor. It is characterized by Leaf-like (phyllode) epithelial pattern formed by an exaggerated intracanalicular pattern. Option B - Inflammatory breast carcinoma: It causes skin changes in the involved breast. It presents as a red and swollen breast, mimics mastitis. It is characterized by dermal lymphatic invasion by tumor cells on a skin punch biopsy of the affected breast. Option D - Fibroadenoma: It usually occurs in young women and regresses after menopause. The tumor consists of proliferating epithelial and mesenchymal components. Stroma proliferates around tubular ducts (pericanalicular pattern) or compressed cleft-like ducts (Intracanalicular pattern).",

      "question": "Which of the following is NOT a favorable prognostic marker for a middle-aged woman diagnosed with breast carcinoma presenting with a lump in her right breast?",
      "options": {
        "A": "Luminal subtype",
        "B": "Low Ki7 index",
        "C": "Her2 overexpression",
        "D": "Mucinous carcinoma"
      },
      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "of the human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) protein on the surface of a cell. HER2 is a type of receptor that is involved in the regulation of cell growth and division. It is overexpressed in approximately 15-30% of breast cancer cases, as well as in other types of cancer. Incorrect choices: Option a. The Luminal subtype is a molecular classification of breast cancer, which is determined based on the genes expressed by the cancer cells. This subtype is defined by the presence of hormone receptors - estrogen receptors (ER) and/or progesterone receptors (PR). The Luminal subtype is further divided into two subtypes: Luminal A and Luminal B. Option b. Ki-67 is a protein that is associated with cell proliferation and is often used as a prognostic marker in breast cancer. A higher Ki-67 index is generally associated with a more aggressive form of cancer. Option d. Mucinous carcinoma is a type of cancer that starts in cells that produce mucus, called mucin. It is a relatively rare subtype of invasive cancer and can occur in many different organs or tissues, including the breast, colon, and ovaries. Mucinous carcinoma is defined by the presence of extracellular mucin that fills more than 50% of the tumor volume.",

      "question": "A 35-year-old female presents with a lump in the upper outer part of her breast. Histopathological analysis of the mass reveals a signet ring appearance. What is the probable diagnosis?",
      "options": {
        "A": "Colloid carcinoma",
        "B": "Papillary carcinoma",
        "C": "Medullary carcinoma",
        "D": "Phyllodes tumour"
      },
      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: A) Colloid carcinoma Explanation: Colloid carcinoma, or mucinous carcinoma, is characterised by extracellular mucin and signet ring cells, where mucin pushes the nucleus to one side, creating a ring-like appearance. This carcinoma typically occurs in older women and presents as a soft, mobile mass. Mucinous or Colloid Carcinoma: A subtype of infiltrating ductal carcinoma. Location: Upper outer quadrant (most common). Clinical findings: Soft to firm lump due to mucilage. It may be mistaken for a benign tumour. Histopathology: Gross: Soft, rubbery texture with pale gelatinous/jelly consistency. Microscopy: Tumour cells arranged in clusters or islands with pools of mucin extracellularly and may be intracellularly (called signet ring cell). FNAC: Chicken wire blood vessels. Excellent prognosis. Source: https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File: Histopathology_of_mucinous_invasive_ductal_carcinoma_of_the_breast.jpg Gross pathology (upper left) of biopsies of mucinous carcinoma shows gelatinous areas (which are transparent compared to normal yellow fatty tissue). Histopathology shows clusters or nests of tumour cells floating in pools of extracellular mucin. Papillary carcinoma (Option B) of the breast accounts for about 0.5% of all breast cancers, primarily affecting postmenopausal women aged 60 to 80. It generally has a favorable prognosis. Clinically, it may be asymptomatic or present with bloody nipple discharge or a palpable mass. On mammography, it appears as a high-density mass with circumscribed margins, sometimes accompanied by satellite nodules, microcalcifications, or a dilated ductal pattern. Medullary carcinoma (Option C) of the breast is typically well-circumscribed, moderately firm, and has a fleshy grey-tan cut surface, often appearing lobular or nodular with areas of haemorrhage, necrosis, or cystic degeneration. Tumours are usually smaller than 3 cm, with a median size of 2 to 3 cm. Patients commonly present with a palpable mass in the upper outer quadrant, which is well-defined clinically and on imaging. Axillary lymphadenopathy may also be present, indicating potential metastatic involvement. Phyllodes tumour (Option D) is a rare fibroepithelial neoplasm with a spectrum from benign to malignant, classified by the WHO based on nuclear atypia, stromal cellularity, mitotic activity, tumour margins, and stromal overgrowth. These tumours typically present as nodular masses with clear boundaries, although some may be ill-defined due to surrounding tissue invasion. The tumour is lobulated, solid, and firm, with a grey or grey-yellow colour, often containing narrow gaps or cavities filled with a clear, bloody, or jelly-like fluid.",

Papillary carcinoma (Option B) is defined by the presence of papillary structures within the tumor. The tumour cells typically show elongated nuclei with nuclear grooves and intranuclear pseudo inclusions, which are distinct features not seen in colloid carcinoma. Medullary carcinoma (Option C) is a type of invasive breast carcinoma that presents with sheets of poorly differentiated tumour cells. These cells have large, pleomorphic nuclei and prominent nucleoli, which is different from the mucin-filled appearance in colloid carcinoma. Lobular carcinoma (Option D) originates from the lobular units of the breast and is characterised by tumour cells infiltrating in a single-file pattern, known as the Indian file pattern. The cells may exhibit signet ring morphology but do not form mucin pools, as seen in colloid carcinoma.",
