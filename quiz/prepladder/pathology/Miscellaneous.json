      "correct_answer": "D",
      "explanation": "Correct answer: D) Autosomal recessive Explanation: The progressive difficulty with coordination and balance in both siblings, along with the maternal uncle's being affected, suggests Friedreich's ataxia (A repeat expansion of the trinucleotide GAA (guanine-adenine-adenine), typically in the gene's first intron, is the leading cause of this disease) a pattern consistent with autosomal recessive inheritance. In this scenario, both parents are likely carriers of a defective gene responsible for Friedreich's ataxia, and each sibling has inherited two copies of the defective gene , resulting in the development of this disorder. Autosomal recessive inheritance: Autosomal recessive disorders require both copies of the gene (one from each parent) to be affected for the condition to manifest. Horizontal transmission: The trait appears in siblings and parents are normal. History of consanguineous marriage: The parents are blood-related. Both the couple are carriers of abnormal genes. 25% chance of having an affected child (double dose of abnormal gene) in a carrier couple. Early age of onset and complete penetrance are common. Skipping of generations can be seen. Both males and females have an equal chance of getting affected. They include almost all inborn errors of metabolism.

      "question": "A 25-year-old male has been complaining of painless, progressive central vision loss in both eyes over the past few months. He reports a family history of similar visual problems, with his maternal grandfather and maternal uncle experiencing sudden vision loss in their 20s. On examination, the ophthalmologist notes bilateral optic disc pallor and central scotomas on visual field testing. The patient denies any systemic symptoms or significant medical history. What is the inheritance pattern seen in this condition? A. B. C. D.",
      "options": {},
      "correct_answer": "D",
      "explanation": "CORRECT ANSWER: D) EXPLANATION: The clinical presentation, along with the family history of sudden vision loss in multiple maternal relatives, is highly suggestive of Leber hereditary optic neuropathy (LHON) , a maternally inherited mitochondrial disorder affecting the optic nerves. Mitochondrial inheritance: A unique feature of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) is maternal inheritance. This peculiarity exists because ova contain numerous mitochondria within their abundant cytoplasm, whereas spermatozoa contain few, if any. Hence the mtDNA complement of the zygote is derived entirely from the ovum. Thus, mothers transmit mtDNA to all their offspring , male and female. Daughters transmit the DNA to their further progeny. Properties: mtDNA encodes enzymes involved in oxidative phosphorylation , mutations affecting these genes exert their deleterious effects primarily on the organs most dependent on oxidative phosphorylation such as the central nervous system, skeletal muscle, cardiac muscle, liver, and kidneys. Each mitochondrion contains thousands of copies of mtDNA, and typically, deleterious mutations affect some, but not all, of these copies. Thus, tissues and individuals may harbor both wild-type and mutant mtDNA, which is known as heteroplasmy. A minimum number of mutant mtDNAs must be present in a cell or tissue before oxidative dysfunction causes disease. This is called the threshold effect. Mitochondria and their contained DNA are randomly distributed to the daughter cells during cell division. Thus when a cell containing normal and mutant mtDNA divides, the proportion of the normal and mutant mtDNA in daughter cells is extremely variable. Therefore the expression of disorders resulting from mutations in mtDNA is quite variable. Mitochondrial disorders: Leber’s hereditary optic neuropathy. Mitochondrial myopathy. MELAS (Mitochondrial encephalopathy, Lactic acidosis, and Stroke-like episodes). MERRF syndrome (Myoclonal Epilepsy with Ragged Red Fibre). Kearns-Sayer syndrome. All generations of the family are affected in a vertical pattern with equal male and female involvement. Hence it shows autosomal dominant inheritance.(OPTION A) The mother has transmitted the defective gene to both her son and daughter. But, in the second generation, the father has transmitted the disease only to females. Hence it shows an X-linked dominant",

        "D": "Western Blotting"
      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "CORRECT ANSWER: B) Fluorescence In Situ Hybridization (FISH) EXPLANATION: FISH uses DNA probes that recognize sequences specific to particular chromosomal regions. In the case of HER2 testing, FISH directly visualizes HER2 gene amplification by labelling the HER2 gene with a fluorescent probe. HER2 protein overexpression is virtually always caused by amplification of the region of chromosome 17q that contains the HER2 gene. The increase in HER2 gene copy number is detected by fluorescence in situ hybridization using a HER2-specific probe (red signal), which is typically co-hybridized to tumour cell nuclei with a second probe specific for the centromeric region of chromosome 17 (green signal), allowing the chromosome 17 copy number to be determined. FISH can be used for testing: Chromosomal translocations Deletions Amplifications FISH cannot detect point mutations. Immunohistochemistry (IHC): (Option A) IHC involves staining tissue samples with antibodies specific to HER2/neu protein. While widely used for HER2 testing, it does not directly measure gene amplification Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) (Option C ) PCR amplifies DNA sequences, including the HER2 gene, from tumour samples. It can detect gene amplification but It is not commonly used for HER2 testing in breast cancer patients. Western Blotting (Option D) Western blotting detects specific proteins in a sample but does not directly measure gene amplification.
