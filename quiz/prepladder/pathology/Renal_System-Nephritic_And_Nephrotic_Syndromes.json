      "explanation": "membrane Correct Answer: C) Irregular thickening, thinning, and splitting of the glomerular basement membrane Explanation: The clinical presentation and EM findings of the characteristic basket-weave appearance of GBM suggest Alport syndrome arises due to mutations affecting type IV collagen, resulting in hematuria progressing to chronic renal insufficiency. It presents alongside sensorineural hearing impairment and various ocular manifestations, including lens subluxation, posterior subcapsular cataracts, and corneal dystrophy. Histologically, Alport syndrome shows distinct electron microscopic features: GBM exhibits irregular areas of thickening interspersed with thinning. Splitting and layering of the lamina densa (basket-weave appearance of GBM) Effacement of podocyte foot processes (Option A) Effacement of podocytes is characteristically seen in Minimal change disease, not the Alport syndrome. Thickening of the glomerular basement membrane with subepithelial electron-dense deposits (Option B) Membranous nephropathy shows the thickening of the glomerular",

      "correct_answer": "D",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: D) Armani-Ebstein lesion Explanation: In uncontrolled diabetes, glucosuria causes glycogen accumulation in the proximal tubular cells (not in the glomerulus), known as Armanni-Ebstein cells. This pathological finding is more commonly associated with diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) than with diabetic nephropathy. Incorrect options explanation Kimmelstiel-Wilson nodule (Option A) Kimmelstiel-Wilson nodules (aka Nodular glomerulosclerosis) are a hallmark of diabetic nephropathy. They are ovoid or spherical, PAS-positive nodules found in the mesangial core of glomeruli. They are often accompanied by mesangiolysis and sometimes surrounded by dilated capillary loops. Diffuse glomerulosclerosis (Option B) Diffuse glomerulosclerosis refers to a diffuse increase in the mesangial matrix and thickening of GBM. It correlates with deteriorating renal function and increasing proteinuria. This is the most common histopathological finding of diabetic nephropathy. Arteriolar hyalinosis (Option C) Arteriolar hyalinosis involves the accumulation of hyaline material in the walls of both afferent and efferent arterioles, contributing to ischemia and kidney damage in diabetes. Hyaline material accumulated in capillary loops is known as “fibrin caps” in Bowman’s capsule, it is called “capsular drops.”",

In primary membranous nephropathy, antibodies primarily target the M-type phospholipase A2 receptor (PLA2R) located on the basal surface of podocytes. This triggers complement activation and subepithelial immune complex deposition, resembling Heymann nephritis lesions. Other less common target antigens include THSD7A and neutral endopeptidase (CD10). The presence of anti-PLA2R antibodies is crucial for diagnosing the disease.",

      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: B) NPHS2 Explanation: The above clinical scenario points towards the diagnosis of steroid-resistant nephrotic syndrome, which is defined as the absence of remission despite 4 weeks of therapy with daily prednisone at a dose of 2 mg/kg/d. Mutations in the NPHS2 gene lead to this syndrome, typically manifesting in childhood. The NPHS2 gene is located on chromosome 1q25–q31. The NPHS2 gene encodes the protein product known as podocin which is localised to the slit diaphragm within the kidney. Patients typically present from birth to 6 years of age have a steroid-resistant course and reach End-stage Renal Disease (ESRD) before the end of their first decade. NPHS1 (Option A) NPHS1 mutations are associated with congenital nephrotic syndrome of the Finnish type. α -actinin 4 (Option C) Mutations in the gene encoding the podocyte actin-binding protein α -actinin 4 (ACTN4) underlie some cases of autosomal dominant focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS), which tends to have a high rate of progression to renal insufficiency. TRPC6 (Option D) Mutations in the TRPC6 gene, which encodes a calcium-permeable ion channel in podocytes , have been identified in some cases of familial FSGS. However, TRPC6 mutations are not typically linked to childhood-onset steroid-resistant nephrotic syndrome. Reference: Robbins and Cotran Pathologic Basis of Disease, 10th edition, page 915",

        "D": "Non-selective proteinuria"
      },
      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: C) Good response to corticosteroid therapy Explanation: The clinical and electron microscope findings suggest the diagnosis as Minimal Change Disease (MCD) , characterised by diffuse effacement of foot processes of podocytes in glomeruli. It primarily affects children aged 2-6 years. MCD typically responds rapidly to corticosteroid therapy, especially in children (>90%), leading to complete remission of proteinuria and resolution of symptoms. Lipid deposition within glomerular capillaries (Option A) Lipid deposition within glomerular capillaries is not observed in MCD. Instead, protein and lipid deposition may occur in the proximal tubules due to tubular reabsorption of lipoproteins passing through diseased glomeruli, leading to the historical term \"lipoid nephrosis\" for this disease. Immunofluorescence microscopy reveals granular deposition of IgG and C3 in the glomeruli (Option B) Immunofluorescence studies in MCD typically show no significant immune complex deposition or granular staining patterns. This distinguishes MCD from immune complex-mediated glomerular diseases like IgA nephropathy or lupus nephritis, where IgG and C3 deposits are commonly observed. Non-selective proteinuria (Option D) Minimal Change Disease (MCD) typically presents with highly selective proteinuria , mostly albumin . Renal function remains good despite massive proteinuria, with no hypertension or hematuria commonly. Reference: Robbins and Cotran Pathologic Basis of Disease, 10th edition, page 914",

It is marked by the widespread flattening of podocytes, seen only on electron microscopy, while light microscopy shows normal glomeruli with lipids in proximal tubules.

      "question": "A 32-year-old woman with a history of SLE presents with fatigue, decreased urine output, and facial swelling. Lab tests show elevated serum creatinine, proteinuria, and hematuria. A renal biopsy is performed, and the histopathological examination image is attached. Which statement is true regarding this condition?",
      "options": {
        "A": ">50% of glomeruli showing crescents is diagnostic.",
        "B": "More the number of crescents, better the prognosis.",
        "C": "Crescents are composed solely of endothelial cells.",
        "D": "Primarily caused by bacterial infections."
      },
      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "scenario and the histopathological image suggest a Rapidly Progressive Glomerulonephritis (RPGN) diagnosis in a patient with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). Crescentic glomerulonephritis (or RPGN) is characterised by the presence of crescents in more than 50% of glomeruli on renal biopsy. More the number of crescents, the better the prognosis (Option B) In RPGN, more crescents generally indicate a poor prognosis Crescents are composed solely of endothelial cells (Option C) Crescents are composed of fibrin, leucocytes, parietal and visceral layers of Bowman capsule. Primarily caused by bacterial infections (Option D) RPGN Type I, II, III can be due to varied causes.",
