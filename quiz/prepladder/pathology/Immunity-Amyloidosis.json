      "explanation": "CORRECT ANSWER: D) 2,3,5 EXPLANATION: Amyloid is defined as a proteoglycan and a misfolded protein , seen extracellularly . (Statements 1 and 2) The presence of abundant charged sugar groups in these adsorbed proteins gives the deposits staining characteristics that were thought to resemble starch (amylose). Therefore, the deposits were called amyloid 95% of amyloid consists of fibril proteins, with the remaining 5% being glycosaminoglycans (dermatan sulfate and heparan sulfate) and plasma proteins, notably serum amyloid P . (Statement 4) Physical nature of amyloid: Light microscopy with H & E stains: Amyloid is an amorphous , eosinophilic , hyaline , and extracellular substance. (Statement 5) Electron microscopy: All types of amyloid, regardless of clinical setting or chemical composition, consist of continuous, nonbranching fibrils with a diameter of approximately 7.5 to 10 nm. X-ray crystallography and infrared spectroscopy: Characteristic cross- β -pleated sheet conformation is responsible for the distinctive Congo-red staining and apple-green birefringence of the amyloid.

These abnormal fibrils are produced by the aggregation of misfolded proteins.

Seen in multiple myeloma and other monoclonal plasma cell proliferations . AL type of amyloidosis is seen. Amyloid light chain (AL) protein is made up of complete immunoglobulin light chains, the amino-terminal fragments of light chains, or both. Most of the AL proteins analyzed are composed of λ light chains or their fragments, but κ chains are present in some cases. The AL type of amyloid fibril protein is produced from free Ig light chains secreted by monoclonal plasma cells. Secondary amyloidosis.

      "question": "A 65-year-old male with a history of multiple myeloma in remission presents with fatigue, weight loss, and abdominal discomfort. He reports early satiety and a palpable firm mass in the left upper quadrant. Which finding is not associated with this condition?",

      },
      "correct_answer": "D",
      "explanation": "Correct answer: D) Nephritic Syndrome Explanation: The given clinical scenario of a male with fatigue , weight loss , abdominal discomfort , swelling in the left upper quadrant (splenomegaly), and a history of multiple myeloma is suggestive of AL amyloidosis . Nephritic syndrome is not associated with this condition, rather, nephrotic syndrome can be seen. Sago spleen: It refers to amyloid deposits largely limited to the splenic follicles (white pulp), producing tapioca-like granules on gross inspection. Lardaceous spleen: This involves amyloid deposition in the walls of the splenic sinuses and connective tissue framework in the red pulp. Carpal tunnel syndrome: Can be associated with amyloidosis, especially in patients on long-term hemodialysis due to amyloid deposition in the carpal ligament. Nephrotic syndrome: Amyloidosis more commonly causes nephrotic syndrome (not nephritic) due to glomerular amyloid deposition. Nephritic syndrome is characterised by inflammation, while amyloidosis involves protein deposition without significant inflammation. Other Findings in amyloidosis: Organ Description Kidneys Most common and serious form of organ involvement . Amyloid in arterial/arteriolar walls causes ischemia and kidney shrinkage. Deposits primarily in glomeruli, leading to capillary narrowing and glomerular obsolescence. Liver Causes moderate to marked hepatomegaly. Amyloid deposits in the space of Disse encroach on hepatic cells and sinusoids, leading to parenchymal replacement. Liver function is usually preserved despite extensive involvement. Heart Can occur in systemic or senile amyloidosis. Amyloid deposits between myocardial fibres and subendocardially, causing pressure atrophy and potential ECG abnormalities. Heart may appear enlarged or firm Tongue Nodular deposits cause macroglossia, known as tumour-forming amyloid of the tongue Respiratory Tract Involvement ranges from the larynx to small bronchioles, either focally or diffusely Nerves Peripheral and autonomic nerve involvement is seen in familial amyloidotic neuropathies.

      "question": "A 60-year-old man with poorly controlled hypertension and diabetes presents with fatigue, shortness of breath, ankle swelling, hepatomegaly, and bilateral lower extremity oedema. Labs show proteinuria and elevated serum creatinine. Which staining technique is most appropriate to confirm the diagnosis?",
      "options": {
        "A": "Periodic acid Schiff (PAS) stain",
        "B": "Masson trichome stain",
        "C": "Congo red stain",
        "D": "Oil red O"
      },
      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "CORRECT ANSWER: C) Congo red stain EXPLANATION: The clinical presentation of a patient with poorly controlled diabetes and hypertension, hepatomegaly, bilateral lower extremity oedema, proteinuria, and elevated serum creatinine highly point towards a diagnosis of AA amyloidosis , where chronic inflammation leads to the production of SAA , resulting in amyloid deposition in various organs. Congo red stain is the most appropriate technique to confirm the diagnosis of amyloidosis. Investigations in amyloidosis: The diagnosis depends on the histologic demonstration of amyloid deposits in tissues. The most common sites biopsied are the kidney when renal manifestations are present or rectal or gingival tissues in patients suspected of having systemic amyloidosis. Examination of abdominal fat aspirates stained with Congo red can also be used for the diagnosis of systemic amyloidosis. Stains/technique Appearance Congo red Most widely used and specific. Light microscopy: Salmon pink/red stains. Polarising microscopy: Apple-green birefringence. H & E Eosin & hematoxylin staining on light microscopy. Amorphous , eosinophilic , extracellular substance. Thioflavin T Fluorescent stain. Yellow colour under UV light. Electron microscopy Non-branching fibrils of indefinite length. Diameter: 7.5-10 nm. X-ray crystallography & infrared spectroscopy Cross- β -pleated sheet conformation. Methyl violet Crystal violet PAS Amyloid positive. Gross staining by Lugol's Iodine - Mahogany brown appearance Abdominal fat aspiration is preferred over rectal biopsy. In suspected cases of AL amyloidosis, serum, and urine protein electrophoresis and immunoelectrophoresis should be performed. Bone marrow aspirates in such cases often show monoclonal plasmacytosis , even in the absence of overt multiple myeloma. Scintigraphy with radiolabeled serum amyloid P component is a rapid and specific test since it binds to the amyloid deposits and reveals their presence. It also gives a measure of the extent of amyloidosis and can be used to follow patients undergoing treatment. The given images below show Congo red staining in amyloidosis. Periodic acid Schiff (PAS) stain(Option A): While positive for amyloid, it's not specific and less commonly used for diagnosis. Masson trichrome stain(Option B): Primarily used for connective tissue (collagen appears blue, smooth muscles appear red, the nucleus appears black), not specific for amyloid. Oil red O(Option D): Used for lipids, not applicable for amyloid detection.",
