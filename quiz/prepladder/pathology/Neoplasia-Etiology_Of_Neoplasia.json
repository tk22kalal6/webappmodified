        "A": "Zinc",
        "B": "Benzopyrene",
        "C": "Arsenic",
        "D": "Cadmium"
      },
      "correct_answer": "D",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: D) Cadmium Explanation: Occupational exposure to cadmium, commonly found in industries such as zinc mining, smelting of zinc ores, and battery manufacturing, has been associated with an increased risk of prostate cancer. The body accumulates cadmium through inhalation of dust and fumes containing cadmium particles. Zinc (Option A) Zinc is an essential trace element important for prostate health, excessive zinc exposure does not have a direct association with prostate cancer. Benzopyrene (Option B): Benzopyrene, a polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) present in tobacco smoke and combustion products, is associated with increased risks of lung cancer, bladder cancer, skin cancer, and other malignancies. Arsenic (Option C): Prolonged exposure to arsenic can occur through contaminated water, soil, and food, commonly by the use of arsenic-based pesticides and herbicides. It is associated with an increased risk of developing skin, lung, bladder, and liver cancers. Reference: Robbins and Cotrans Pathologic basis of disease 10th edition, page 321, 414",

      "question": "Which of the following conditions is most likely associated with vinyl chloride exposure?",
      "options": {
        "A": "Hepatocellular carcinoma",
        "B": "Hepatic angiosarcoma",
        "C": "Cholangiocarcinoma",
        "D": "Focal nodular hyperplasia"
      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: B) Hepatic angiosarcoma Explanation: Hepatic angiosarcoma is a high-grade vascular malignancy and is the most common sarcoma arising in the liver, especially in those with significant exposure to Vinyl chloride. It is more common in men and occurs in the elderly. Some other risk factors include arsenic, anabolic steroids, radiation, and thorium dioxide (Thorotrast). Hepatocellular carcinoma (Option A) Hepatocellular carcinoma is the most common primary liver cancer and is typically associated with cirrhosis, chronic hepatitis B or C infections due to HBV or HCV, alcohol abuse, or non-alcoholic fatty liver disease and not associated with exposure to vinyl chloride. Cholangiocarcinoma (Option C) Cholangiocarcinoma (carcinoma of the biliary duct in the liver) includes conditions that lead to chronic inflammation of the bile ducts, such as Primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC), liver fluke infections such as Clonorchis and Opisthorcis, or certain jbiliary tract disorders. It is not associated with vinyl chloride exposure . Focal nodular hyperplasia (Option D) Focal nodular hyperplasia (FNH) is the second most common benign liver lesion after hepatic hemangioma. It consists of hyperplastic hepatocytes surrounding a central scar, which can result from altered blood flow. FNH is more prevalent in women and is associated with hormonal imbalances but not with vinyl chloride exposure. Reference: Robbins and Cotrans Pathologic basis of disease 10th edition, page 522",

      "question": "A 16-year-old girl presents with a clear-cell vaginal tumour. Upon further inquiry, it was revealed that her mother has a history of taking medication during pregnancy to prevent premature labour. Which medication is most likely associated with the development of this tumour in the daughter?",
      "options": {
        "A": "DES (Diethylstilbestrol)",
        "B": "Thalidomide",
        "C": "Tamoxifen",
        "D": "Medroxyprogesterone acetate"
      },
      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: A) DES (Diethylstilbestrol) Explanation: In the given scenario, the clear cell vaginal tumour in the daughter is most likely linked to DES (Diethylstilbestrol). DES, a synthetic estrogen previously administered to pregnant women to prevent miscarriages and pregnancy complications, has been associated with a significantly increased risk of clear cell adenocarcinoma of the cervix or vagina in daughters exposed to it in utero. Thalidomide (Option B): Thalidomide, once used to treat morning sickness in pregnant women, caused severe birth defects like limb deformities (phocomelia), blindness, deafness, heart issues, and brain damage in their babies. It is a teratogen, not a carcinogen. Tamoxifen (Option C): Tamoxifen is a selective estrogen receptor modulator used in the treatment of ER-positive breast cancer. While it is associated with an increased risk of endometrial cancer in women who take it for breast cancer treatment, it's not linked to clear cell vaginal tumours in their daughters. Medroxyprogesterone acetate (Option D): It is a synthetic progestin commonly used in hormonal therapies and contraceptives. Long-term use or high doses of MPA, particularly in combination with estrogen, may increase the risk of breast cancer. However, maternal use of it is not typically associated with vaginal tumours in daughters. Reference: Robbins and Cotrans Pathologic basis of disease 10th edition, page 321, 994",

      "question": "Which of the following radiations is the most common cause of skin cancer?",
      "options": {
        "A": "UV-A radiation",
        "B": "UV-B radiation",
        "C": "UV-C radiation",
        "D": "UV-D radiation"
      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: B) UV-B radiation Explanation: UV-B radiation is the major cause of sunburn and skin cancer. These medium wavelengths (280-320 nm) primarily affect the outer layers of the skin and are highly mutagenic. It is responsible for inducing the formation of pyrimidine dimers within DNA, leading to mutations that can result in various types of skin cancer, including squamous cell carcinoma, basal cell carcinoma, and melanoma. Fair-skinned individuals are at higher risk. UV-A radiation (Option A): UV-A rays are longer wavelengths (320-400 nm) and penetrate deeper into the skin. They primarily cause skin ageing. UV-A radiation, particularly in combination with UV-B, can increase the risk of skin cancer. UV-C radiation (Option C) These shorter wavelengths (200-280 nm) are extremely potent in terms of DNA damage, but they are largely filtered out by the Earth's ozone layer and do not reach the surface in significant amounts. UV-D radiation (Option D): The UV spectrum typically consists of UV-A, UV-B, and UV-C and no UV-D radiation. Reference: Robbins and Cotrans Pathologic basis of disease 10th edition,Page 323",

      "question": "A 55-year-old female radiology technician with 25 years of occupational exposure to diagnostic X-rays and fluoroscopy presents with a three-month history of increasing fatigue, unintentional weight loss, and frequent infections. Which cancer type is most likely associated with her occupational history?",
      "options": {
        "A": "Acute Myeloid Leukemia",
        "B": "Pancreatic cancer",
        "C": "Medullary thyroid cancer",
        "D": "Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia"
      },
      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: A) Acute Myeloid Leukemia Explanation: Due to prolonged exposure to ionising radiation the patient is at an increased risk of developing Acute Myeloid Leukemia (M/C cancer in individuals with exposure to ionising radiation). Ionising radiation, which includes electromagnetic (x-rays, γ rays) and particulate ( α particles, β particles, protons, neutrons) radiations, is carcinogenic. It can cause cancer by directly damaging cellular DNA, leading to mutations that disrupt normal gene function and structure. Leukaemia often has a relatively short latent period, typically around 7 years or less after exposure to certain factors like radiation or chemicals. Solid tumours like breast, colon, thyroid, and lung cancers generally have longer latent periods compared to leukaemia. Pancreatic cancer (Option B): Risk of Pancreatic cancer is more associated with cigarette smoking, heavy alcohol drinking, obesity, and diet (high intake of saturated fat and/or meat, particularly smoked or processed meats). Medullary thyroid cancer (Option C): Medullary thyroid cancer is primarily associated with genetic factors, specifically mutations in the RET proto-oncogene, rather than radiation exposure. However, the risk of Papillary carcinoma of the thyroid and Follicular carcinoma of the thyroid have a high association with radiation exposure. Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia (Option D): Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia (CLL) is the only leukaemia not associated with radiation exposure.

        "D": "High-risk 16, 18"
      },
      "correct_answer": "D",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: D) High-risk 16, 18 Explanation: The abnormal cells in the pap smear and biopsy are known as Koilocytes characterised by a raisinoid nucleus and a perinuclear halo, which indicates HPV infection. High-risk HPV types like HPV 16 and HPV 18 are strongly linked to a higher risk of cervical cancer, including high-grade cervical dysplasia and invasive cancer. Low-risk HPV types such as HPV 6 and HPV 11 are often associated with genital warts such as condyloma acuminatum and low-grade changes in cervical cells (Option A). 16- Most common 18- Most specific Integration of viral DNA within the E1/E2 open reading frame disrupts the E2 viral repressor gene, leading to increased expression of the HPV E6 and E7 oncogenes. Integration of high-risk HPV DNA is a critical step in the oncogenic process, distinguishing it from low-risk HPV infections.

        "D": "E7 can inactivate cyclins A and E"
      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: B) E6 stimulates the expression of TERT. Explanation: E6 and E7 proteins from high-risk HPV types exhibit increased affinity for key cellular regulatory proteins (e.g., p53, RB) compared to low-risk HPV types. This enhanced affinity allows high-risk HPV-infected cells to evade tumour suppressor mechanisms, dysregulate cell cycle control, and promote oncogenic transformation. Oncogenic Activities of E6 Protein Oncogenic Activities of E7 Protein Binds to and promotes degradation of p53 → Impairs cell growth and apoptosis regulation (Option A). Stimulates expression of TERT (telomerase reverse transcriptase) → Facilitates cellular immortalisation by maintaining telomere length. Disrupts interaction between RB protein and E2F transcription factors Inactivates CDK inhibitors (e.g., p21 and p27) (Option C). Activates cyclins A and E (Option D) All these mechanisms enhance cell cycle progression and cellular proliferation in HPV infections.",

Burkitt Lymphoma: Burkitt lymphoma is an aggressive B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma. It is most commonly associated with Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) infection, which is endemic in central Africa and New Guinea, where it is the most common childhood tumour. EBV, a DNA oncogenic virus, infects epithelial cells of the oropharynx and B-cells via the CD21 molecule on their surface. Its LMP-1 (latent membrane protein-1) gene activates NF- κβ and JAK/STAT pathways, promoting B-cell survival and proliferation, increasing the risk of B-cell lymphoma. Another EBV gene, EBNA-2, transactivates host genes like cyclin D and src family genes. EBV's genome contains viral IL-10, suppressing T-cell activation by macrophages and monocytes, crucial for",

      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "origin. Correct Answer: A) Gastric lymphomas associated with H. pylori infection are primarily of B-cell origin. Explanation: H. pylori, the first bacterium classified as a carcinogen, is associated with gastric adenocarcinomas and lymphomas, including MALT lymphomas of B-cell origin. Gastric adenocarcinomas arise due to increased epithelial cell proliferation in chronic inflammation caused by H. pylori infection. Pathogenicity genes like CagA (cytotoxin-associated A) trigger uncontrolled growth factor pathways. (Option B) H. pylori produces a bacterial toxin VacA, inducing apoptosis in gastric epithelial cells and influencing cancer development. (Option C) Chronic H. pylori infection leads to polyclonal B-cell proliferation triggered by H. pylori-reactive T cells, which contribute to the development of MALT lymphomas. Antibiotic therapy can eradicate H. pylori and \"cure\" MALT lymphomas by removing the antigenic stimulus for T cells . But, MALT lymphomas associated with t(11;18) translocation are resistant to anti-H.Pylori therapy. (Option D) Reference: Robbins and Cotrans Pathologic basis of disease 10th edition, Page 327",
