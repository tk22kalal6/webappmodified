      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: A) Factor V Leiden mutation Explanation: Factor V Leiden mutation is the most common cause of inherited coagulopathy among the given options. Hypercoagulability It refers to an increased tendency of the blood to clot, usually due to changes in coagulation factors. Types: Primary disorders (genetic) Secondary disorders (acquired) Among inherited causes, point mutations in the factor V and prothrombin genes are the most common. Primary disorders (Genetic) Secondary disorders (Acquired) Common Factor V mutation A single-nucleotide mutation (autosomal dominant inheritance) in the factor V gene makes factor V resistant to cleavage and inactivation by protein C. Prothrombin mutation A single nucleotide change (G20210A) in the 3 ′ -untranslated region of the prothrombin gene is linked to hypercoagulability. Rare Antithrombin III deficiency (Option B) Protein C deficiency (Option C) Protein S deficiency (Option D) Very rare Fibrinolysis defects Homozygous homocystinuria (deficiency of cystathionine β -synthetase) Strong Risk Factors for Thrombosis Prolonged bed rest or immobilization Myocardial infarction Atrial fibrillation Tissue injury (surgery, fracture, burn) Cancer Prosthetic cardiac valves Disseminated intravascular coagulation Heparin-induced thrombocytopenia Antiphospholipid antibody syndrome Other Risk Factors for Thrombosis Cardiomyopathy Nephrotic syndrome Hyperestrogenic states (pregnancy and postpartum) Oral contraceptive use Sickle cell anemia Smoking Reference: Robbins & Cotran Pathologic Basis of Disease, 10th Edition, Page 126-127.",
