      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: B) Ferrocyanide to ferroferric cyanide Explanation: The Prussian blue stain is a histological stain used primarily to detect ferric iron (Fe³ I ) in tissues, cells, and blood smears. It works based on the reaction of potassium ferrocyanide with ferric ions to form an insoluble blue compound called Prussian blue (ferroferric cyanide) which stains blue and is insoluble in water. The reaction can be summarized as follows: Fe 3+ + Fe 2+ (Ferrocyanide) ¬ Fe 3 (Fe(CN) 6 ) 2 Therefore, when tissues or cells are stained with Prussian blue, ferric iron deposits appear blue under microscopy, aiding in the detection and localization of iron in biological specimens. Note: Lillie’s stain is used for ferrous (Fe 2+ ) detection. Reference: Robbins & Cotran Pathologic Basis of Disease, 10th Edition, Page 655",

      "question": "A 5-year-old child presents to the clinic with symptoms of irritability, abdominal pain, and vomiting. The physician suspects lead poisoning and orders a complete blood count along with a peripheral blood smear. Which of the following findings would most likely be seen on the peripheral blood smear in lead poisoning?",

        "C": "Basophilic stippling",
        "D": "Bite cells"
      },
      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: C) Basophilic stippling Explanation: Basophilic stippling is a characteristic finding seen in lead poisoning. The retained rRNA appears as small blue granules on a stained peripheral blood smear, leading to the characteristic basophilic stippling seen on blood smears. The accumulation of ribosomal RNA in lead poisoning is a consequence of disrupted heme synthesis, leading to ineffective red blood cell maturation and the retention of rRNA in developing erythrocytes. Schistocytes (Option A): These fragmented red blood cells are typically seen in microangiopathic hemolytic anaemia caused by conditions such as thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP) or disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), not in lead poisoning. Spherocytes (Option B): These are round cells with no central pallor, associated with hereditary spherocytosis Bite cells (Option D): Bite cells are seen in G6PD deficiency. In G6PD deficiency, oxidative stress leads to the denaturation of haemoglobin, resulting in the formation of Heinz bodies (aggregates of denatured haemoglobin). Macrophages in the spleen recognize and remove these Heinz bodies, creating a characteristic bite-shaped appearance.",

      "explanation": "Correct answer: B) Ancylostoma Explanation: The clinical presentation (fatigue, pallor, and pica) and laboratory findings (microcytic anaemia, and low serum ferritin levels) in this patient point towards iron deficiency anaemia. Lab Parameters Iron Deficiency Anemia (IDA) Ferritin Low Transferrin saturation Low Serum Iron Low TIBC High Hookworm (Ancylostoma) infection is a well-known cause of iron deficiency anaemia, particularly in children. Hookworms attach to the intestinal wall to feed on the host’s blood, leading to chronic blood loss. This results in microcytic anaemia due to iron deficiency, especially in children with limited dietary iron intake. Giardia lamblia (Option A): This protozoan parasite causes giardiasis, which primarily leads to malabsorption and chronic diarrhoea with fatty stools. Diphyllobothrium latum (Option C): This fish tapeworm causes megaloblastic anaemia(macrocytic) due to vitamin B12 deficiency rather than iron deficiency anaemia. Enterobius vermicularis (Option D): Commonly known as pinworm, this parasite primarily causes anal itching and discomfort, particularly in children.

Causes of sideroblastic anaemia: Congenital causes Due to enzyme deficiencies like ALA synthase, ferrochelatase, etc. Acquired causes Vitamin B6 deficiency Drugs like isoniazid and chloramphenicol Lead and alcohol poisoning Vitamin B6 (Pyridoxine) is a cofactor for the enzyme Aminolevulinic Acid Synthase (ALAS), which catalyses the first step in the heme biosynthetic pathway. Deficiency of vitamin B6 leads to the development of sideroblastic anaemia. Vitamin B1 (Thiamine)(Option A) : Thiamine is important for carbohydrate metabolism and nerve function. Its deficiency leads to conditions such as Wernicke-Korsakoff syndrome and beriberi but is not associated with sideroblastic anaemia. Folic acid and vitamin B12 are vital for DNA synthesis and red blood cell production. Their deficiencies lead to megaloblastic anaemia, but not sideroblastic anaemia and vitamin B12 deficiency also causes neurological issues(Subacute Combined Degeneration) (Options C and D).

      "explanation": "Correct Answer: B) MCH Explanation: The least useful investigation in determining the underlying cause of anemia is MCH (Mean Corpuscular Hemoglobin). MCH measures the average amount of hemoglobin per red blood cell. MCH can be valuable when used together with MCV to refine the classification of anemia but it does not independently yield as much diagnostic information regarding the underlying causes of anemia as other tests MCV (Option A) categorizes anemia by measuring the red blood cell size: microcytic (<80 fL), normocytic (80-100 fL), and macrocytic (>100 fL), aiding in identifying underlying causes such as iron deficiency or vitamin B12 deficiency. Peripheral smear ( Option C) is used to assess the morphology of red blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets, crucial in identifying abnormalities such as hypochromia , microcytosis , or macrocytosis ,. Reticulocyte count ( Option D) measures the percentage of reticulocytes in the blood and can indicate the bone marrow's response to anemia.

In iron deficiency anemia (IDA), a peripheral blood smear can reveal characteristic changes. Hypochromic Red Blood Cells: The RBCs appear pale due to decreased hemoglobin content. Microcytic Red Blood Cells: RBCs are smaller than normal due to decreased hemoglobin synthesis. Anisocytosis: There is significant variation in the size of RBCs. Poikilocytosis: RBCs may show abnormal shapes, such as pencil cells, target cells (codocytes), and occasionally, elliptocytes. Macrocytic red cells (Option A): Macrocytosis typically indicates a deficiency in vitamin B12 or folate, not iron.

It is the serum iron to TIBC ratio and reflects the percentage of transferrin saturated with iron. In iron deficiency, less iron is available for binding to transferrin, leading to a decreased saturation. Total iron binding capacity (TIBC) (Option A) is increased in iron deficiency anemia. It represents the maximum amount of iron that can be bound to transferrin. RBC protoporphyrin (Option B) is a precursor to heme, and in the absence of sufficient iron, protoporphyrin accumulates. Transferrin receptor (TfR) (Option D) expression on cells increases to enhance cellular uptake of iron when iron stores are low.

The elevated RDW suggests a wide variation in red blood cell sizes, which is characteristic of iron deficiency anemia. Iron deficiency anemia can result from dietary lack, impaired absorption, increased iron requirement (e.g., during pregnancy), or chronic blood loss (e.g., gastrointestinal bleeding). Clinical features include Koilonychia, alopecia, atrophic glossitis, and esophageal webs, pica and intestinal malabsorption, affecting overall nutritional status Megaloblastic anemia (Option B) usually presents with macrocytic anemia due to deficiencies in vitamin B12 or folate. Sideroblastic anemia (Option C) can also present with microcytosis, but it is usually associated with ringed sideroblasts in the bone marrow and may show elevated iron indices. Thalassemia major (Option D) usually presents in infancy or early childhood with severe anemia, failure to thrive, and a need for regular blood transfusions. This patient’s high RDW (28) suggests iron deficiency anemia, as thalassemia typically shows a normal RDW due to uniformly small red cells.There’s no mention of classic features of thalassemia major, such as hepatosplenomegaly or bone deformities. Lastly, the MCV of 75 fL is low but not as profoundly low as usually seen in thalassemia major. Reference: Robbins & Cotran Pathologic Basis of Disease, 10th Edition, Page 655",

        "A": "Ferritin translation is increased by binding IRP to IRE.",
        "B": "Ferritin translation is decreased by binding IRP to IRE.",
        "C": "Transferrin receptor 1 translation is unaffected by binding IRP to IRE.",
        "D": "Transferrin receptor 1 translation is decreased by binding IRP to IRE."
      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: B) Ferritin translation is decreased by binding IRP to IRE. Explanation: In iron deficiency anemia, ferritin translation is decreased by binding iron regulatory protein to iron response elements. Iron regulatory mechanism: IRP: Binds to IREs in specific mRNAs' untranslated regions (UTRs) to control the translation of proteins involved in iron metabolism. IRE: These are sequences found in the mRNAs of proteins involved in iron metabolism, such as ferritin and transferrin receptor 1 Ferritin: Ferritin stores iron inside cells. When iron levels are low, IRPs bind to IREs in the 5' UTR of ferritin mRNA, preventing its translation to conserve iron. Transferrin receptor 1 (TfR1): TfR1 imports iron into cells. When iron levels are low, IRPs bind to IREs in the 3' UTR of TfR1 mRNA , stabilizing it and increasing its translation to enhance iron uptake.

      },
      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: C) DMT-1 Explanation: DMT-1 is a transmembrane protein that facilitates the transport of divalent metal ions, primarily ferrous iron (Fe 2+ ), across the apical membrane of enterocytes in the duodenum. Heme iron enters the intestinal cells directly through a heme transporter. Non-heme iron (Fe³ I ) is first reduced to Fe² I by duodenal cytochrome B, then Fe² I enters the cells via the DMT-1 transporter (Option C) . Inside the duodenal cell, Fe² I can either be stored as mucosal iron or transported into the bloodstream. Fe² I exits the cell through ferroportin (Option A) . In the blood, Fe² I is oxidized to Fe³ I by hephaestin (Option B) and ceruloplasmin. Fe³ I binds to transferrin for delivery to the bone marrow, where it is stored as ferritin; in cases of hemolysis, ferritin aggregates to form hemosiderin. The liver secretes hepcidin (Option D) , a protein that regulates iron absorption. When iron stores are adequate, hepcidin downregulates ferroportin expression, reducing iron absorption.

      "question": "A 28-year-old woman presents with fatigue and pallor. Lab tests show hemoglobin of 9 g/dL and MCV of 68 fL. Peripheral smear reveals microcytic and hypochromic red blood cells. Her symptoms and laboratory findings are consistent with iron deficiency anemia. Which of the following statements regarding iron deficiency anemia (IDA) is correct?",

        "D": "Serum ferritin levels are not affected."
      },
      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: C) Decreased serum ferritin levels Explanation: Serum ferritin is a key marker used in diagnosing iron deficiency anemia. In iron deficiency, ferritin levels are decreased because ferritin stores decrease as iron stores deplete. (Option A and D) Serum ferritin levels below 30 ng/mL are generally considered indicative of depleted iron stores and are a reliable marker for iron deficiency. Serum ferritin is the gold standard investigation (Option B): While serum ferritin is commonly used as a marker for iron stores, it is not considered the gold standard test for diagnosing iron deficiency. A bone marrow aspirate to directly assess iron stores is the gold standard for diagnosing iron deficiency. Reference: Robbins & Cotran Pathologic Basis of Disease, 10th Edition, Page 655",

      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: C) Duodenum Explanation: The given clinical presentation of low hemoglobin, increased RDW, and microcytic hypochromic red cells on peripheral smear, points towards the diagnosis of Iron deficiency anemia . Iron is primarily absorbed through the duodenal mucosa , making duodenum the most likely site of absorption. Metabolism of iron: Iron from the diet (heme and non-heme) is converted to ferrous form in the stomach. Heme iron is primarily found in animal-based foods, while non heme iron is found in plant-based foods and iron-fortified foods. In the duodenum, ferrous iron is absorbed via DMT1 and transported into enterocytes. Inside, it binds to ferritin or enters the bloodstream via ferroportin. Iron binds to transferrin in the blood, facilitating its delivery to tissues for functions like hemoglobin synthesis. Hepcidin, a peptide hormone produced by the liver, plays a crucial role in regulating iron homeostasis. Jejunum (Option A) absorbs nutrients like amino acids, glucose, fatty acids, and folic acid. Ileum (Option B) completes nutrient absorption, including bile salts, vitamin B12 , and remaining nutrients, before the material enters the colon. Colon (Option D) focuses on absorbing water, electrolytes like sodium and chloride, and some vitamins from gut bacteria, such as vitamin K and biotin.",
