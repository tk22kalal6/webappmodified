      "question": "An 8-month-old male infant presents with a history of severe, recurrent bacterial infections. On physical examination, the tonsils were found to be absent. Peripheral blood examination reveals an absence of B cells, while the T cell count is normal. Additionally, serum analysis reveals undetectable levels of immunoglobulins (IgG, IgA, and IgM). Which of the following most accurately explains the molecular mechanism responsible for this patient's immunodeficiency?",
      "options": {
        "A": "BTK gene mutation",
        "B": "RAG1/2 gene mutation",

      },
      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "Correct answer: A) BTK gene mutation Explanation: The clinical vignette suggests that the infant is suffering from Bruton's agammaglobulinemia , which is characterized by the failure of B-cell precursors (pro–B cells and pre–B cells) to develop into mature B cells due to the defect in BTK gene . Bruton’s agammaglobulinemia or hypogammaglobulinemia: X-linked recessive , most commonly seen in boys . Pathophysiology: Failure of pre-B cells to differentiate into immature B cells in the bone marrow - due to the absence of Bruton’s tyrosine kinase (BTK) enzyme . As a result, there is a total absence of B cells and plasma cells in the circulation, with depressed serum levels of all classes of immunoglobulins. However, Pre-B cells are found in normal numbers in bone marrow and the T cell-mediated responses are also normal. The B cell maturation stops at pre-B cell stage; after the synthesis of heavy-chain without forming the light chains. Hence the cytoplasm of pre-B cell may have incomplete immunoglobulins Clinical features: Recurrent bacterial infections. Infections do not develop until 6 months of age (when maternal antibodies are no longer active). On examination: Tonsils may be difficult to visualize. Cervical/inguinal lymph nodes may not be palpable. Laboratory findings and other features: Marked reduction or absence of B cells in the peripheral circulation. Immunoglobulin levels (IgG, IgM, and IgA) are low or undetectable. Plasma cells are absent throughout the body. T-cell mediated reactions are normal. Management: Immunoglobulin replacement therapy. Antibiotics to treat infections. Live vaccines are contraindicated RAG1/2 gene mutation (Option B) leads to severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID) , where both B and T cell functions are impaired due to defective V(D)J recombination. CD40 ligand deficiency (Option C) leads to Hyper IgM syndrome , where T-B cell interactions are defective, but B cells are still present. BAFF (B-cell activating factor) receptor abnormality (Option D) can contribute to common variable immunodeficiency (CVID) . However, CVID typically presents later in childhood or adulthood and is characterized by low serum immunoglobulin levels and impaired antibody responses with the presence of B cells.",

      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "CORRECT ANSWER: A) WASP gene mutation EXPLANATION: WASP gene mutation analysis, specific to Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome. Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome is an X-linked recessive disease characterized by the triad of: Thrombocytopenia Eczema Recurrent infections Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome is caused by mutations in the gene located at Xp11.23, which encodes the Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome protein (WASP). WASP belongs to a family of proteins that are believed to link membrane receptors, such as antigen receptors, to cytoskeletal elements. Patients do not make antibodies to polysaccharide antigens, and the response to protein antigens is poor. IgM levels in the serum are low, but levels of IgG are usually normal. Paradoxically, the levels of IgA and IgE are often elevated . Patients are also prone to developing B-cell lymphomas. WASP may be involved in cytoskeleton-dependent responses, including cell migration and signal transduction, but the essential functions of this protein in lymphocytes and platelets are unclear. It may lead to early death. The only treatment is HSC transplantation. ANA titre ( OPTION B ) These are typically associated with SLE ( systemic lupus erythematosus ) FISH (OPTION C ) FISH (Fluorescence In Situ Hybridization) is a molecular cytogenetic technique used to detect and localize specific DNA sequences within the chromosomes. It uses fluorescently labelled probes that bind to their complementary sequences on chromosomes, allowing for visualization of specific genes or regions of interest under a fluorescence microscope Also used in microdeletion, amplification or translocation. FISH is an investigation of choice for Di-George syndrome. B cell tyrosine kinase activity detection: (OPTION D ) Detection of B cell tyrosine kinase activity is relevant for X-linked agammaglobulinemia (XLA), characterized by the absence of mature B cells and low levels of immunoglobulins.

      "question": "Assertion: Patients with Common Variable Immunodeficiency (CVID) commonly present with recurrent respiratory infections, gastrointestinal issues, and autoimmune disorders.

        "D": "Assertion is false, but Reason is true"
      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "for Assertion Correct Answer: B) Both Assertion and Reason are true, but Reason is not the correct explanation for Assertion. Explanation: While the assertion about Common Variable Immunodeficiency (CVID) symptoms is correct, the reason is incorrect because defects in the BTK gene cause Bruton’s (X-Linked) agammaglobulinemia, not CVID. The BTK gene converts immature B cells into mature B cells. The BAFF gene then produces plasma cells and antibodies from the mature B cells. Differences between Bruton's hypogammaglobulinemia and CVID: Bruton's hypogammaglobulinemia CVID BTK gene defect Common in boys (X-linked) Manifests after 6 months of age B cell defect Hypoplastic germinal centers Patients are susceptible to infections by Haemophilus influenzae, Streptococcus pneumoniae, or Staphylococcus aureus. BAFF gene defect Occurs in both boys & girls Manifests in childhood or adolescence B cell and T cell defect Hyperplastic germinal centers Patients are susceptible to persistent diarrhoea caused by G. lamblia.

      "question": "A 35-year-old male with a known history of selective IgA deficiency receives a blood transfusion during surgery. Shortly after the transfusion, he develops acute allergic reactions, including hives and difficulty breathing. Given his IgA deficiency, which blood products should have been considered to minimize the risk of such complications?",
      "options": {
        "A": "Standard red blood cells with no modification",
        "B": "Plasma products that are rich in IgA",
        "C": "Washed red blood cells",
        "D": "Fresh frozen plasma"
      },
      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: C) Washed red blood cells Explanation: Patients with selective IgA deficiency risk developing anaphylactic reactions if they receive IgA blood products. To minimize this risk, it is essential to transfuse blood products that have been processed to reduce IgA levels, such as washed red blood cells. In contrast, standard red blood cells or IgA-rich products could trigger severe allergic reactions, as seen in this patient. Selective IgA deficiency: It is caused by impaired differentiation of naïve B lymphocytes to IgA-producing plasma cells. Most individuals are asymptomatic. IgA is the primary antibody found in mucosal secretions , and its deficiency weakens mucosal defences. This can lead to infections in the respiratory, gastrointestinal, and urogenital tracts. Symptomatic patients often experience recurrent sinus and lung infections, as well as diarrhoea. Patients with IgA deficiency frequently suffer from respiratory allergies and a range of autoimmune diseases, including systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and rheumatoid arthritis. When transfused with blood containing normal IgA, some individuals may experience severe and potentially fatal anaphylactic reactions, as their immune system treats the IgA as a foreign antigen. In this situation, the safest method is to use washed red blood cells, plasma, or platelets from known IgA-deficient donors.

      "explanation": "Correct Answer: D) Pneumocystis jirovecii Explanation: The clinical presentation of recurrent infections along with the findings of mutation in CD40L gene suggests the diagnosis of Hyper IgM syndrome . Hyper IgM syndrome: Normally, the antigen binds to the antibody on B cells and is then presented to the T cells. CD40L (also known as CD154) on antigen-activated CD4+ helper T cells binds to CD40 on B cells, macrophages, and dendritic cells (DCs). This interaction is crucial for triggering Ig class switching (from IgM to IgG, IgA, and IgE) and affinity maturation in B cells. In hyper IgM syndrome, there is a defect in the CD40 receptor or CD40 ligand (most common). As a result, patients have high IgM levels but low levels of IgG, IgA, and IgE, and are prone to recurrent infections. In addition, these patients are also susceptible to pneumonia caused by Pneumocystis jirovecii .",

      "explanation": "Correct Answer: C) Hyper IgM syndrome Explanation: The clinical presentation of autoimmune hemolytic anaemia, thrombocytopenia and neutropenia with the flow cytometry findings showing CD40 negative and CD19 negative, is most likely suggestive of Hyper IgM syndrome. Hyper IgM syndrome: In hyper IgM syndrome, mature B cells are present, but they are incapable of Ig class switching and affinity maturation because of a defect in the CD40 receptor or CD40 ligand . The patient’s serum will have elevated levels of IgM but no IgA or IgE and extremely low levels of IgG. Occasionally, the IgM antibodies react with blood cells, giving rise to autoimmune hemolytic anemia, thrombocytopenia, and neutropenia. Flow cytometry: Flow cytometry results are typically represented as histograms or dot plots: Histograms : Represent the frequency distribution of a single parameter. Dot plots : Display two parameters on the x- and y-axes. The given image is a dot plot and it has 4 quadrants as follows: Quadrant 1 (green) Negative for antigen A, positive for antigen B Quadrant 2 (purple) Negative for both antigens Quadrant 3 (yellow) Positive for both antigens Quadrant 4 (red) Positive for antigen A, negative for antigen B The dot plot in the question has CD19 (pan B-cell marker) on the X-axis and CD40 on the Y-axis . The majority of the cells are in the double negative quadrant, indicating that both CD40 and CD19 are almost negative in this patient, suggesting the diagnosis of hyper IgM syndrome.

These mutations disrupt the signalling of integrins on platelets and leukocytes, which impairs cellular adhesion The deficiency of Sialyl Lewis X (SLex), caused by mutations in the SLC35C1 gene in Leukocyte Adhesion Deficiency Type 2 (LAD-2), leads to impaired leukocyte adhesion. SLex is a crucial glycoconjugate involved in the adhesion of leukocytes to endothelial cells, facilitating their migration from the bloodstream into tissues during inflammation or infection. Defective opsonisation (Option B): Opsonisation is the process by which immune cells, particularly phagocytes like neutrophils and macrophages, mark pathogens or foreign particles for phagocytosis. This marking is often facilitated by opsonins such as antibodies or complement proteins. A defect in opsonisation would lead to impaired recognition and clearance of pathogens by phagocytes, potentially increasing susceptibility to infections. Reduced chemokine production (Option C): Chemokines are signalling molecules that play a key role in immune cell migration, including leukocyte recruitment to sites of infection or inflammation. Reduced production of chemokines could result in inadequate recruitment of leukocytes to sites of infection, potentially leading to compromised immune responses. Increased neutrophil apoptosis (Option D): Apoptosis, or programmed cell death, is a regulated process in various cell types, including neutrophils. Increased neutrophil apoptosis could affect the lifespan and function of these immune cells, potentially impacting immune responses and pathogen clearance.

Mechanism : This leads to the inability to produce reactive oxygen species (ROS) needed to kill certain bacteria and fungi. The nitroblue tetrazolium (NBT) test is the primary screening test for CGD. Clinical Presentation : Recurrent infections, particularly with catalase-positive organisms (e.g., Staphylococcus aureus, Aspergillus), granuloma formation. Hyper IgM Syndrome: (Option C) Cause : Loss of function of CD40 or CD40 ligand results in impaired class switching and affinity maturation of antibodies. Characteristics : Elevated IgM levels and reduced IgG and IgA. Clinical Presentation : Recurrent bacterial infections. A hallmark of it is elevated IgM levels, not low levels of all immunoglobulins.

      "explanation": "Correct Answer: C) X-Linked Agammaglobulinemia Explanation: X-linked agammaglobulinemia (Bruton Agammaglobulinemia) is a primary immunodeficiency disorder mainly affecting males, caused by mutations in the BTK gene on the X chromosome characterised by the failure of B-cell precursors (pro–B cells and pre–B cells) to develop into mature B cells. BTK Function : BTK encodes Bruton tyrosine kinase, essential for B-cell development by facilitating the rearrangement of immunoglobulin light chain genes. B-cell Deficiency : In XLA, B-cell precursors fail to mature due to defective BTK, leading to a severe shortage or absence of mature B cells in the bloodstream. Immunoglobulin Levels : Markedly reduced levels of IgG, IgA, and IgM are observed in XLA, resulting in susceptibility to recurrent bacterial infections. Lymphoid Tissue Impact : Germinal centres in lymph nodes and tonsils fail to develop properly, leading to absent or underdeveloped tonsils and lymph nodes. Clinical Presentation : Patients typically present with frequent respiratory tract infections caused by bacteria such as Haemophilus influenzae, Streptococcus pneumoniae, and Staphylococcus aureus. Management : Treatment involves immunoglobulin replacement therapy (IVIG) to restore antibody levels and reduce infections. The classic form of this disease has the following characteristics: B cells are absent or markedly decreased in the circulation, and serum levels of all classes of immunoglobulins are depressed. Pre–B cells, which express the B-lineage marker CD19 but not membrane Ig, are found in normal numbers in the bone marrow. Germinal centres of lymph nodes, Peyer patches, the appendix, and tonsils are underdeveloped. Plasma cells are absent throughout the body. T cell-mediated reactions are normal. Common Variable Immunodeficiency (CVID) (Option A): CVID involves defective antibody production and recurrent bacterial infections, mainly in the respiratory and gastrointestinal tracts. Typically presents later in life, during adolescence or adulthood, unlike XLA. Options B, D: Absent tonsils and lymph nodes are not specific to SCID and Hyper-IgM Syndrome.

      "explanation": "Correct Answer: C) Ataxia Telangiectasia Explanation : The clinical scenario (dysarthria, slurred speech, recurrent infections, telangiectasia shown in the image above, decreased serum IgA, IgG, and IgE) suggests ataxia telangiectasia. Ataxia Telangiectasia (AT) is an autosomal-recessive disorder. Key features: abnormal gait (ataxia), vascular malformations (telangiectases), neurological deficits, increased tumors, and immunodeficiency. Immunodeficiency impacts both B and T cells, mainly causing defective production of IgA and IgG2 antibodies. Thymic hypoplasia often results in milder T-cell defects. Patients frequently experience respiratory tract infections, autoimmune issues, and higher cancer risks. Caused by a mutation in the gene on chromosome 11 encoding the ATM protein kinase. ATM activates p53 in response to DNA damage, prompting cell cycle checkpoints and apoptosis. ATM deficiency impairs DNA repair, affecting antigen receptor generation",

        "D": "Severe Combined Immunodeficiency (SCID)"
      },
      "correct_answer": "D",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: D) Severe Combined Immunodeficiency (SCID) Explanation: Adenosine deaminase deficiency aligns with the clinical picture of SCID , where affected individuals are highly susceptible to severe infections. Severe Combined Immunodeficiency (SCID) : Various genetically distinct syndromes with defects in both humoral and cell-mediated immunity. Presentation : Infants show oral candidiasis (thrush), extensive diaper rash, and failure to thrive. GVHD : Some may develop a rash from maternal T cells attacking the fetus. T-Cell Defect : Typically primary, with secondary impairment of humoral immunity. Treatment : Requires hematopoietic stem cell transplantation or gene therapy. Types of SCID : X-Linked SCID : The most frequent form primarily affects boys. Mutation in the common γ -chain ( γ c) subunit of cytokine receptors. Severe reduction in T-cell numbers, impaired antibody synthesis, and often deficiency in NK cells due to IL-15 receptor involvement. Contains lobules resembling fetal thymus. Autosomal Recessive SCID : Often due to adenosine deaminase (ADA) deficiency. ADA deficiency leads to toxic accumulation of deoxyadenosine derivatives, particularly affecting rapidly dividing T lymphocytes. Hypoplastic lymphoid tissues with marked depletion of T-cell areas and sometimes B-cell zones. Other Causes include mutations in recombinase-activating genes (RAG), JAK3, and various signaling molecules associated with T-cell receptors and calcium channels. Options A, B, and C do not typically lead to a virtual absence of peripheral lymphoid organs, as seen in adenosine deaminase deficiency.

      },
      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: C) DiGeorge syndrome Explanation: DiGeorge syndrome , or 22q11.2 deletion syndrome , is characterised by a microdeletion on chromosome 22q11. Clinical features represented by CATCH22 C : Cardiac defects, especially conotruncal anomalies A : Abnormal facial features, such as low set ears, hypertelorism, and short philtrum T : Thymic hypoplasia C : Cleft palate or cellular immune deficiency H : Hypoparathyroidism with hypocalcemia It presents with low immunity and recurrent infections due to variable loss of T cell-mediated immunity (resulting from hypoplasia or lack of the thymus), tetany (resulting from lack of the parathyroids), congenital defects of the heart (Tetralogy of Fallot) and great vessels. Facial dysmorphisms, including a long face with a prominent nasal bridge, are consistent with the findings in this case. The T-cell zones of lymphoid organs—the paracortical areas of the lymph nodes and the periarteriolar sheaths of the spleen—are depleted. Ig levels may be normal or reduced, depending on the severity of the T-cell deficiency. One gene in the deleted region is TBX1, which is required to develop the branchial arch and the great vessels. Down syndrome (Option A): Down syndrome is characterized by trisomy 21. Turner syndrome (Option B): Turner syndrome results from complete or partial monosomy of the X chromosome. Cri-du-chat syndrome (Option D): Cri-du-chat syndrome is caused by a deletion on the short arm of chromosome 5. It presents with a high-pitched cat-like cry, intellectual disability, microcephaly, and facial dysmorphisms but lacks the cardiac anomalies and thymic aplasia seen in DiGeorge syndrome.
