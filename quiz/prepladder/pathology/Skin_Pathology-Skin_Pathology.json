        "D": "Ichthyosis"
      },
      "correct_answer": "D",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: D) Ichthyosis Explanation: Ichthyosis is a group of inherited skin disorders characterised by chronic, excessive buildup of keratin (hyperkeratosis), leading to dry, scaly skin resembling fish scales. It results from defective desquamation, causing retention of abnormally formed scales. Freckles (Option A): Freckles (Ephelides) are small, tan-red or light brown macules that appear after sun exposure. They result from increased melanin pigment within basal keratinocytes, not excess keratin. The number of melanocytes is normal, but the degree of pigmentation changes with sun exposure. Lentigo (Option B): Lentigo refers to benign localised hyperplasia of melanocytes. It presents as small, oval, tan-brown macules or patches. Unlike freckles, lentigines do not darken with sun exposure. The key feature is linear melanocytic hyperplasia restricted to the cell layer above the basement membrane without excess keratin. Nevus (Mole) (Option C): Nevi are benign neoplasms of melanocytes, often caused by mutations leading to activation of the RAS signalling pathway. They are typically small, uniformly pigmented macules or papules with well-defined borders. There is no excessive keratin production in nevi.",

      },
      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: A) Associated with TERT mutations Explanation: Malignant melanoma is characterized by the clinical presentation of a rapidly changing mole with irregular borders and varying color. It is often associated with activating mutation in the TERT gene, which is responsible for telomerase formation. There are three main types of genetic mutations seen in malignant melanoma. Melanomas show colour variations, and the borders are irregular and notched. They show two patterns of growth. Radially : Superficial spread on the epidermis and dermis, lack metastatic potential. (Option B) Vertical spread into the deep dermis, characterised by the appearance of a nodule, has metastatic potential. (Option C) ABCDE of Melanoma: A - Asymmetry: One half doesn't match the other half in shape. B - Border: The edges of the mole are irregular rather than smooth and defined. C - Colour: Uneven colour. It may include different shades of brown, black, or tan. D - Diameter: Growns larger (about the size of a pencil eraser). E - Evolving: The mole changes in size, shape, colour, or appearance over time. On microscopy, they have enlarged nuclei and prominent red (eosinophilic) nucleoli with melanin pigment.",

      "options": {
        "A": "Hippo pathway signaling",
        "B": "Hedgehog signaling pathway",
        "C": "WNT signaling",
        "D": "RAS/MAPK signaling"
      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: B) Hedgehog signaling pathway Explanation: The hedgehog signaling pathway is associated with the pathogenesis of basal cell carcinoma, a locally aggressive cutaneous tumour. They present as pearly papules containing dilated blood vessels (telangiectasias) They may ulcerate locally and invade the underlying bone or facial sinuses (rodent ulcers) . Histologically, the tumour cells are basophilic cells with hyperchromatic nuclei (basaloid cells) arranged in clusters with a palisading pattern. The stroma sometimes retracts from the malignant cells. Hippo pathway signaling (Option A): It is seen in Neurofibromatosis type 2, an autosomal dominant disease, due to mutations in the NF2 gene causing activation of the protein, merlin. It presents with acoustic schwannoma and meningioma. WNT signaling pathway (Option C): This pathway is implicated in various familial colonic polyps and carcinomas of the stomach, colon, and pancreas, as well as melanomas. It is disrupted by mutations in the APC gene, which result in dysregulation of the adenomatous polyposis coli protein and subsequent abnormal activation of the WNT signaling pathway. RAS/MAPK signaling (Option D): Inhibition of RAS/MAPK signaling is seen in Neurofibromatosis type 1. This is due to mutations in the NF1 gene that produce Neurofibromin-1. It presents with neurofibromas, malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumours, neuroblastoma and juvenile myeloid leukaemia.",

        "C": "An Autosomal dominant disorder",
        "D": "Associated with loss of nucleotide excision repair mechanism"
      },
      "correct_answer": "D",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: D) Associated with loss of nucleotide excision repair mechanism. Explanation: Loss of nucleotide excision repair mechanism is associated with Xeroderma pigmentosum and these patients are at increased risk of squamous cell and basal cell skin cancers due to exposure to UV light because of an inability to repair pyrimidine dimers. The clinical presentation is suggestive of Gorlin syndrome , an autosomal dominant disorder (Option C) characterised by the development of multiple basal cell carcinomas before age 20. It also presents with various other tumours like medulloblastomas, ovarian fibromas, odontogenic keratocysts (Option A) and pits of the palms and soles. The gene associated is PTCH, a tumour suppressor gene (Option B) Patients with Gorlin syndrome inherit one defective PTCH allele; the remaining normal allele undergoes UV-induced mutation. This mutation activates SMO and GLI1, contributing to basal cell carcinoma development. Reference: Robbins and Cotran Pathologic Basis of Disease, 10th Edition, Page 1147, 315",

      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: B ) CK20 Explanation: The given clinical scenario points towards the diagnosis of Merkel cell carcinoma, a highly aggressive neuroendocrine skin cancer characterised by rapid growth, early metastasis, and a high mortality rate. Predisposing factors include immune suppression, sun exposure, and advanced age. Most MCCs involve the clonal integration of Merkel cell polyomavirus (MCPyV), which is crucial for tumour growth. It typically presents as a fast-growing, reddish, firm nodule on sun-exposed skin. CK20 is a cytoskeletal protein commonly expressed in Merkel Cell Carcinoma, hence used as a specific marker. Its characteristic perinuclear dot-like staining pattern is a key diagnostic feature. S-100 (Option A) and Melan-A (Option C) are more useful in the diagnosis of Melanoma and are not typically associated with Merkel Cell Carcinoma (MCC) p40 (Option D) is a marker commonly used in diagnosing squamous cell carcinoma and not useful in Merkel cell carcinoma.

      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: C ) Sawtoothing of the dermoe-pidermal junction Explanation: The given clinical scenario and histological features point towards the diagnosis of lichen planus, which presents as itchy, violaceous, flat-topped papules with Wickham striae that can coalesce to form plaques. They are typically distributed symmetrically on the extremities, wrists, and elbows, and oral mucosa is commonly involved. Histologically, lichen planus is characterised by a dense lymphocytic infiltrate along the dermo-epidermal junction, resulting in a sawtooth appearance. Basal keratinocytes exhibit degeneration, and Civatte bodies (anucleate, necrotic basal cells) are often observed in the papillary dermis. Munro microabscesses (Option A) are histological findings typically seen in psoriasis, not lichen planus. They are collections of neutrophils within the stratum corneum of the epidermis.

        "D": "Intraepidermal split"
      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: B) Suprabasal split Explanation: The given clinical scenario is consistent with Pemphigus vulgaris, in which the split occurs above the basal layer of the epidermis, leading to a suprabasal split. This is due to autoantibodies targeting desmoglein proteins, causing acantholysis (loss of cell adhesion) and blister formation above the basal layer. Subcorneal split (Option A) is a type of split that occurs just below the stratum corneum, the outermost layer of the epidermis. It is characteristic of pemphigus foliaceus, where the blister forms beneath the stratum corneum. Subepidermal split (Option C) is a type of split that occurs beneath the entire epidermis, within the dermis. It is typical of bullous pemphigoid and dermatitis herpetiformis. In bullous pemphigoid, autoantibodies target components of the basement membrane, causing separation at this level. Junctional split (Option D) is a split occurring at the level of the lamina lucida within the basement membrane zone, often seen in junctional epidermolysis bullosa. This condition involves genetic mutations affecting proteins that anchor the epidermis to the dermis, leading to fragile skin that blisters easily.",

      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: A) Cylindroma Explanation: The clinical and histological features described in the scenario are consistent with Cylindroma, benign skin tumours that often appear on the scalp and forehead. They exhibit ductal differentiation and histologically present as basaloid cell islands fitting together like a \"jigsaw puzzle\" within a fibrous stroma. These tumours can merge over time to form larger, turban-like growths. They may be inherited in an autosomal dominant fashion due to mutations in the CYLD gene. Cylindromas are also associated with Brooke-Spiegler syndrome, characterized by the occurrence of multiple adnexal tumours, including cylindromas, trichoepitheliomas, and spiradenomas. Pilomatrixoma (Option B) are benign tumours derived from hair matrix cells, presenting as hard, subcutaneous nodules, typically on the face or upper limbs. Histologically, they are characterized by basaloid cells and ghost cells indicative of hair follicle differentiation. Syringomas (Option C) are benign tumours of eccrine sweat glands, typically presenting as multiple small, flesh-coloured to tan papules, often around the eyelids. Histologically, syringomas are characterized by comma-shaped or tadpole-like projections when viewed under a microscope.
