        "A": "Stimulates the release of FSH",

        "D": "Stimulation of PRL"
      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: B) Inhibits the secretion of FSH Explanation: Inhibin from the granulosa cells inhibits FSH secretion. It is a hormone primarily produced by the ovaries (in females) and testes (in males). It regulates the reproductive system by inhibiting the secretion of FSH (Follicle-Stimulating Hormone) from the anterior pituitary gland. Inhibin suppresses the FSH Inhibin B: Before ovulation Inhibin A: After ovulation Stimulates the secretion of FSH (Option A): Inhibin does not stimulate FSH release; instead, it inhibits it. FSH is involved in the growth and maturation of reproductive cells, but inhibin reduces its secretion once the follicle or sperm production reaches sufficient levels. Inhibition of PRL (Option C) and Stimulation of PRL (Option D): Inhibin does not directly regulate prolactin (PRL), a hormone involved in milk production. PRL levels are primarily controlled by dopamine from the hypothalamus and other factors, not by inhibin. Therefore, inhibin neither inhibits nor stimulates PRL production.

      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: A) Papanicolaou stain Explanation: Papanicolaou stain is the standard stain used in cervical smears to detect cellular abnormalities. The Pap stain results in: Well-stained nuclear chromatin Differential polychromatic counterstaining of the cytoplasm Cytoplasmic transparency H & E stain (Option B) ( hematoxylin and eosin) staining procedure uses two dyes to stain tissue samples, making it easier to see cell structure under a microscope; this is commonly used for histopathological tissue sections , not for cervical smears. Giemsa stain (Option C) is used to stain blood and bone marrow smears, as well as some parasites, but it is not used in cervical cytology. Toluidine blue (Option D) is a basic metachromatic dye primarily used to stain acidic components of tissues, such as nucleic acids and mast cell granules. It is not used for routine cervical cytology.",

      "question": "What is the most probable tumour that a 22-year-old woman with a sizable growth in her right ovary, which has been determined to originate from all three germ layers based on histopathology, is experiencing?",
      "options": {
        "A": "Dysgerminoma",
        "B": "Teratoma",
        "C": "Thecoma",
        "D": "Theca lutein cyst"
      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: B) Teratoma Explanation: Teratomas are tumours that originate from all three germ layers (ectoderm, mesoderm, and endoderm) and are commonly found in the ovaries. They are often seen in young women and can contain a variety of tissue types, such as hair, teeth, and muscle, which reflects their origin from all three germ layers. Immature teratoma: Bulky, solid ovarian tumours that contain immature neuroepithelium, cartilage, bone, and muscle, with areas of necrosis and haemorrhage. They grow rapidly, often spreading beyond the ovary. They are seen in young females and have a high risk of malignancy. They have small, round blue cells (Immature neural components). Mature teratoma Mature teratomas, or dermoid cysts , are common benign ovarian tumours found in young women. They are bilateral in 10-15% of cases. They contain tissues from all three germ layers, including skin, hair, and teeth, and can rarely undergo malignant transformation to squamous cell carcinoma. Grossly, they are unilocular cysts with a thin wall and hair; microscopically, they have stratified squamous epithelium and sebaceous glands. Monodermal teratoma: Monodermal teratomas consist predominantly of a single type of tissue, such as thyroid tissue in struma ovarii or neuroendocrine cells in carcinoid tumours. They lack immature or embryonic-like tissues and typically do not have a high risk of malignancy. Dysgerminoma (Option A) is also a type of germ cell tumour (GCT) that typically secretes beta hCG. Thecoma (Option C) is a rare benign tumour originating from the ovarian stroma, accounting for less than 1% of all ovarian tumours. It is most commonly found in perimenopausal and postmenopausal women. Theca lutein cysts (Option D) are rare benign cystic lesions caused by hypertrophy of the theca interna layer due to excessive stimulation by hCG.",

      "question": "What is the most likely diagnosis for a 48-year-old patient who came with scrotal swelling, had elevated LDH levels but normal AFP levels on tests for testicular tumours, and exhibited a specific histological picture after orchidectomy?",
      "options": {
        "A": "Yolk sac tumor",
        "B": "Teratoma",
        "C": "Seminoma",
        "D": "Embryonal carcinoma"
      },
      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: C) Seminoma Explanation: The clinical presentation and histopathological findings suggest testicular seminoma. Seminomas elevate LDH levels, while AFP remains normal. Histology shows large, uniform cells with clear cytoplasm and prominent nucleoli. Seminoma: It is the most common germ cell tumour of the testis. A similar presentation in the ovary is called dysgerminoma , and germinoma is present in the pineal gland . Incidence: Peak incidence in the fourth decade. Genetics: Seminomas contain isochromosome 12p and express OCT3/4 & NANOG. Morphology: Seminoma has a homogeneous, grey-white, lobulated cut surface, usually devoid of haemorrhage or necrosis . Histology of seminoma: Sheets of monomorphic cells. The sheets are divided into poorly demarcated lobules by the septa of the fibrous tissue. The septa show lymphocytic infiltration (T lymphocytes). The classic seminoma cell is large and round to polyhedral with a distinct cell membrane and a large, central nucleus with one or two prominent nucleoli. The cytoplasm is clear or watery appearing and contains glycogen . The arrows in the image below show seminomatous tumour cells.

      "options": {
        "A": "Urine specimen is used",
        "B": "Sanger sequencing is used",
        "C": "Study of fluid in the tumor microenvironment",
        "D": "DNA is collected in microvessels"
      },
      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: A) Urine specimen is used Explanation: Liquid-based cytology is often used to collect specimens, including urine, and study cells for various diagnostic purposes. Liquid-based cytology: It is a technique to collect and prepare cell samples for microscopic analysis. It involves gathering cells from various body fluids, such as cervical or vaginal fluids, respiratory secretions, or urine, depending on the diagnostic goal. This method is commonly used for cervical cancer screening. Cells collected from the cervix with a brush or spatula are suspended in a preservative solution. This suspension is used to prepare slides for cytological examination to detect abnormalities or disease. Advantages of Liquid-Based Cytology (LBC): Improved slide preparation: LBC creates a thin-layer or monolayer slide preparation, providing better quality and clarity than conventional Papanicolaou (Pap) smears. Enhanced cell preservation: The collection fluid used in LBC fixes, homogenizes, and rinses the cells, ensuring better preservation for microscopic examination. Reduced sample contamination: The homogenization process minimizes the presence of non-representative material, such as blood or mucus, leading to a more accurate analysis of the collected cells. Increased diagnostic accuracy: With improved sample quality, LBC enhances the sensitivity and specificity of cervical cancer screening, allowing for more reliable detection of abnormalities. Disadvantage: Although cervical cytological screening has proven effective in reducing the incidence and mortality of cervical cancer, the conventional Pap test is less sensitive than commonly thought. The false-negative rate of the conventional Pap test has been reported to reach as high as 50%. Reference: https://www.gfmer.ch/GFMER_members/pdf/Liquid-based-cytology-Abd-El-Hafez-2010.pdf",

      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: C) Eosin B Explanation: Eosin B is not a constituent of the Papanicolaou stain. Eosin is a different type of stain typically used for general histology to highlight cytoplasm in tissues, but it is not used in the Papanicolaou (Pap) stain. The Papanicolaou (Pap) stain is a widely used technique for examining cells from the cervix to screen for cervical cancer and other abnormalities. It uses a combination of multiple dyes to differentiate cellular components: Hematoxylin - Stains the cell nuclei, allowing for clear visualization of nuclear structure. Orange G - Stains keratinized cells orange, highlighting squamous cells. Eosin A - Second counterstain & a polychrome mixture of Eosin Y and Light Green (stains cytoplasm and helps differentiate between various cell types).
