        "A": "HLA-DR3",
        "B": "HLA-B27",
        "C": "HLA-DQ8",

      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: B) HLA-B27 Explanation: Reiter Syndrome (also known as Reactive Arthritis) is associated with HLA-B27. It is defined by the triad of: Arthritis Nongonococcal urethritis or cervicitis Conjunctivitis Etiology: It occurs days to weeks after genitourinary (Chlamydia) or gastrointestinal (Shigella, Salmonella, Yersinia, Campylobacter, and Clostrdioides difficile) infections. HIV-positive patients may also be affected. Clinical features: Onset: Acute Enthesitis, oligoarthritis and/or spinal inflammation. Lower limb joints and entheses are predominantly affected. Systemic disturbances like fever and weight loss. Achilles insertional enthesitis/tendonitis or plantar fasciitis may also be present. The first attack of arthritis is usually self-limiting, but recurrent or chronic arthritis can develop. Low back pain and stiffness (due to enthesitis and osteitis) Sacroiliitis Extra-articular features: Circinate balanitis: Starts as vesicles on the coronal margin of the prepuce and glans penis, later rupturing to form superficial erosions with minimal surrounding erythema, some coalescing to give a circular pattern. Keratoderma blennorrhagica: Begins as discrete waxy, yellow-brown vesico-papules with desquamating margins, occasionally coalescing to form large crusty plaques on the palms and soles of the feet. Pustular psoriasis Nail dystrophy with subungual hyperkeratosis Mouth ulcers Conjunctivitis Uveitis HLA-DR3 (Option A) is associated with autoimmune diseases such as Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE), Type 1 diabetes, and Graves' disease, but it is not linked to Reiter's Syndrome (Reactive Arthritis), which is specifically associated with HLA-B27. HLA-DQ8 (Option C) is associated with Celiac disease and some autoimmune disorders, such as Type 1 diabetes, but it is not linked to Reiter's Syndrome. HLA-DR4 (Option D) is associated with autoimmune conditions such as Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA) and Type 1 diabetes. Reference: Robbins and Cotran Pathologic Basis of Disease, 10th Edition, Page 1207.

      "question": "A 15-year-old boy presents with swelling in the upper diaphyseal part of the tibia. X-ray of the swelling showed a periosteal reaction. A histopathological image of the biopsy is given below. Immunohistochemistry was positive for synaptophysin and MIC2. What is the likely diagnosis?",
      "options": {
        "A": "Osteosarcoma",
        "B": "Ewing sarcoma",
        "C": "Metastatic neuroblastoma",
        "D": "Osteoclastoma"
      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "round, uniform cells and positive immunohistochemistry for synaptophysin and MIC2 (CD99) in the diaphysis of long bones like the tibia, is characteristic of Ewing sarcoma. Ewing’s sarcoma: It is a malignant bone tumour characterized by primitive round cells without obvious differentiation . Approximately 80% of patients are younger than 20 years of age. Males are affected slightly more often than Females. It usually arises in the diaphysis of long tubular bones, especially the femur and in the flat bones of the pelvis, and presents as a painful, enlarging mass. The most common mutation (>90% of the cases) is t(11;22)(q24;q12) . Morphology: The tumour is soft , tan-white , and frequently contains areas of haemorrhage and necrosis. It comprises sheets of uniform, small, round cells with scant cytoplasm that may be clear due to abundant glycogen. Homer-Wright rosettes (pseudorosettes) are rounded cell clusters with a central fibrillary core; their presence indicates neuroectodermal differentiation. Specific markers: CD99+ (MIC2) positive. Fibrous septae may also be present, but there is little stroma. Geographic necrosis may be prominent. Chemotherapy-induced necrosis is a positive prognostic indicator. Osteosarcoma (Option A) is a type of bone cancer originating from cells that produce new bone tissue. It often presents with pain and swelling in the affected bone, and X-rays may show a characteristic \"sunburst\" or \"spiculated\" appearance . Histologically, osteosarcoma is characterized by the production of osteoid, a bone-like",

      "question": "A 30-year-old woman has been experiencing left knee pain for one month. The knee is tender to touch, and an X-ray reveals a 5cm mass in the distal femoral epiphysis with a \"soap bubble\" appearance. Microscopy findings are provided below. What is the likely diagnosis?",
      "options": {
        "A": "Chondroblastoma",
        "B": "Osteoclastoma",
        "C": "Osteosarcoma",
        "D": "Osteochondroma"
      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: B) Osteoclastoma Explanation: The clinical presentation and histopathological image reveal numerous multinucleated giant cells within a bone lesion, which highly suggests Osteoclastoma (Giant cell tumour of bone). Giant cell tumour (Osteoclastoma): It is a benign but locally aggressive tumour, characterised by numerous multinucleated osteoclast-type giant cells. It occurs in the third to fifth decades of life. Pathogenesis: The neoplastic cells are primitive osteoblast precursors that express high levels of RANKL, promoting the proliferation of osteoclast precursors and their differentiation into mature osteoclasts. This increased activity of osteoclasts is responsible for the tumour being highly lytic and expansile due to uncontrolled bone resorption. Giant cell tumours develop within the epiphysis and may extend into the metaphysis. Mostly located near the knee, involving the distal femur or proximal tibia. Although rare, they can metastasise to the lungs but typically regress spontaneously and are rarely fatal. Morphology: Grossly, the tumours are large , red-brown masses that frequently undergo cystic degeneration. Histologically, the tumours consist of uniform oval mononuclear tumour cells and abundant osteoclast-type giant cells with 100 or more nuclei. Chondroblastoma (Option A) is a benign, chondroid-producing tumour that usually arises in the epiphysis or apophysis of skeletally immature individuals. It is characterised by a sheet-like proliferation of chondroblasts and presents with pain, joint stiffness, and swelling. Chondroblastomas rarely show a soap bubble appearance on X-ray. Osteosarcoma (Option C) is a malignant bone tumour, typically found in the metaphysis of long bones. It is most common in children and",

      "question": "A woman who had undergone total knee replacement surgery comes back with complaints of knee pain and loosening of implants. The following histopathological slide was obtained, showing foreign body giant cells and the appearance highlighted in the image below. What is your diagnosis?",
      "options": {
        "A": "Ochronosis",
        "B": "Metallosis",
        "C": "Malignant melanoma",
        "D": "Rosai-Dorfman disease"
      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: B) Metallosis Explanation: Metallosis refers to the accumulation of metal debris in tissues commonly associated with wear and corrosion of metal implants, such as those used in joint replacements. This causes inflammation, foreign body giant cells, and metallic debris, visible on histopathology. Metallosis: Definition: Aseptic fibrosis, local necrosis, and prosthetic loosening due to metal wear and corrosion in metal-on-metal (MoM) implants . Pathophysiology: Metallic debris (cobalt, chromium, titanium) triggers an inflammatory response , leading to foreign body giant cell reaction , cytokine release, and tissue necrosis . Systemic metal ion absorption may cause neuropathy, cardiomyopathy, and thyroid dysfunction . Clinical Features: Local : Chronic pain, swelling, pseudotumors, skin discolouration. Systemic : Neurological, cardiac, and endocrine toxicity. Diagnosis: Serum cobalt and chromium levels . MARS MRI (Metal Artifact Reduction Sequence) for pseudotumors. Histopathology : Pigmented macrophages, metal debris, necrosis. Management Regular monitoring of metal ion levels and symptoms. Revision surgery with non-metallic implants in symptomatic cases. Incorrect Options: Ochronosis (Option A) : A rare condition often associated with alkaptonuria, characterized by dark pigmentation in cartilage but not related to metal debris from implants. Malignant melanoma (Option C) is a type of skin cancer that arises from melanocytes. It typically presents as a pigmented skin lesion and does not cause the formation of foreign body giant cells or be associated with metal debris from joint replacements. Rosai-Dorfman disease (Option D) is a rare condition characterized by the",

      "question": "Which of the following conditions will have the least chance of a dry bone marrow aspiration?",
      "options": {
        "A": "Hairy cell leukemia",
        "B": "Acute myeloid leukemia (AML)",
        "C": "Myelodysplastic syndrome",
        "D": "Follicular lymphoma"
      },
      "correct_answer": "D",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: D) Follicular lymphoma Explanation: Follicular lymphoma is less likely to result in a dry bone marrow aspiration compared to the other conditions. In follicular lymphoma, the bone marrow may be infiltrated with lymphoma cells but typically retains enough cellularity for a successful aspiration. Conditions that can lead to a dry bone marrow aspiration (Dry tap): Metastatic carcinoma infiltration (17%) Chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) (15%) Myelofibrosis (14%) Hairy cell leukemia (10%) Acute leukemia (10%) Lymphomas, including Hodgkin’s disease. Hairy Cell Leukemia (HCL) (Option A) , Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML) (Option B) (e.g., AML with myelofibrosis), and Myelodysplastic Syndrome (MDS) (Option C) can all cause dry bone marrow aspiration due to bone marrow fibrosis, increased reticulin deposition or dense cellular infiltration .
