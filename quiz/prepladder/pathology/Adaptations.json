      "explanation": "the ends of chromosomes, thus potentially extending cell's lifespan. Correct Answer: C) Telomerase prevents the shortening of telomeres by adding DNA sequences to the ends of chromosomes, thus potentially extending cells' lifespan. Explanation: Telomerase, also known as the immortality gene, is an RNA-dependent DNA polymerase enzyme that adds DNA sequences to the ends of chromosomes, preventing telomere shortening during cell division. Thousands of telomeres are present at the ends of chromosomes from human birth; by maintaining telomere length with each cell division, telomerase has the potential to extend a cell’s lifespan. (Option A ruled out) It is expressed most in germ cells and is present at low levels in stem cells, but it is absent in most of the somatic cells. (Option B ruled out) Telomerase is a Ribonucleoprotein(RNA containing enzyme) not a Ribozyme(RNA has enzymatic activity) In Telomerase RNA only acts as a template for DNA synthesis (Option D ruled out) In cancer cells, the telomerase is usually reactivated, and telomere length gets stabilized, allowing the cells to proliferate indefinitely.",

      "correct_answer": "D",
      "explanation": "replicative senescence. Correct Answer: D) It represents the maximum number of times a cell can divide before experiencing replicative senescence. Explanation: The Hayflick limit or Hayflick’s phenomenon represents the number of cell divisions a cell undergoes before reaching its replicative senescence. It reflects the limited proliferative capacity of cells due to factors such as telomere shortening. Somatic cells typically undergo around 60-70 divisions before entering a state of replicative senescence. Cells start to show signs of ageing after a finite number of divisions due to factors like telomere shortening and changes in gene expression.

      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: A)Autophagy Explanation: Autophagy is a cellular process by which a cell eats its own contents and plays a critical role in maintaining cellular homeostasis, responding to stressors such as nutrient deprivation, and eliminating potentially harmful cellular materials. Autophagy is the cellular process by which cytoplasmic components, including organelles and proteins, are engulfed by double-membrane vesicles called autophagosomes. These autophagosomes fuse with lysosomes and deliver the cellular content for degradation. It plays a crucial role in maintaining cellular homeostasis by removing damaged organelles, misfolded proteins, and other cellular debris. Autophagy is of 4 types-Macro-autophagy( sequence of complexes involved-ULK1->BECLIN1->LC3),Micro-autophagy, Chaperone Mediated autophagy, Mitophagy.

      "correct_answer": "D",
      "explanation": "LAMP2A for autophagy Correct Answer: D) Binding of chaperones to misfolded proteins, followed by lysosomal entry via LAMP2A for autophagy Explanation: In chaperone-mediated autophagy, chaperone proteins (Eg: Heat shock proteins) recognize and bind to specific protein substrates that are misfolded or damaged. The chaperone-substrate complex then interacts with the lysosomal associated membrane protein LAMP2A, facilitating the substrate protein's translocation into the lysosome for degradation. Direct uptake by lysosomes via endocytosis (Option A): This mechanism is observed in Micro-autophagy. Inhibition of mTOR leading to activation of ULK1 complex (Option B): mTOR is a key regulator, and the ULK1 complex is a key initiator of Macro-autophagy. Selective degradation of damaged or dysfunctional mitochondria (Option C): Selective removal of damaged mitochondria is seen in Mitophagy.

      "correct_answer": "D",
      "explanation": "hyperplasia involves growth factor-driven proliferation of mature cells. Correct Answer: D) Hypertrophy results from increased cellular protein production, while hyperplasia involves growth factor-driven proliferation of mature cells. Explanation: Hypertrophy: Hypertrophy is characterized by increased cellular protein (GATA4, NFAT, MEF 2) production, which leads to the enlargement of cells and tissues due to an increase in cell size. This process typically occurs in response to increased functional demand or hormonal stimulation. E.g. Enlargement of the heart due to increased workload. Hyperplasia: Hyperplasia is described as the result of growth factor-driven proliferation of mature cells. In hyperplasia, the number of cells within an organ or tissue increases, often triggered by external stimuli such as hormonal changes or tissue damage. Eg: Liver regeneration after partial hepatectomy.

      "explanation": "Correct Answer: D) Pathological hyperplasia Explanation: Definition Examples Physiological hypertrophy (Option A) Increase in the size of cells, resulting in organ enlargement due to increased functional demand or hormonal stimulation. Uterine hypertrophy during pregnancy due to estrogenic hormone signalling. Bulging of muscles in bodybuilders due to increased demand. Pathological hypertrophy (Option B) Cell enlargement occurs in response to increased workload or stress. It typically occurs in tissues with limited capacity for cell division, such as cardiac or skeletal muscle. Heart enlargement from hypertension or valvular disease. Physiological hyperplasia (Option C) An increase in the number of cells in response to hormonal or growth factor stimulation in situations where there is a need to increase functional capacity or compensate for damage. Breast glandular epithelium proliferation during puberty or pregnancy. Liver regeneration after partial hepatectomy. Bone marrow hyperplasia in response to blood cell deficiency. Pathological hyperplasia (Option D) Occurs when there is an abnormal increase in the number of cells in an organ or tissue due to excessive or inappropriate hormonal or growth factor stimulation Endometrial hyperplasia due to disturbance in estrogen-progesterone balance. Benign prostatic hyperplasia due to androgenic hormonal stimulation. Note: Pregnant uterus shows both hypertrophy (most common) and hyperplasia. The single best answer is Hypertrophy.

      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: C) Reduction in thymus gland size during ageing Explanation: Physiological atrophy refers to the normal, programmed decrease in the size or mass of tissues, organs, or structures in the body. Atrophy is associated with decrease in both cell size and number leading to decreased orgn size. Physiological atrophy is typically a regulated process that does not indicate underlying disease or dysfunction. The thymus gland, which is involved in the development of the immune system, tends to decrease in size and activity with age, which is an example of physiological atrophy. Pathological atrophy , on the other hand, refers to the abnormal decrease in the size or mass of tissues, organs, or structures due to disease, injury, or other abnormal conditions. It can result from various factors such as disuse, denervation, malnutrition, chronic inflammation, hormonal imbalances, or specific diseases. Options A, B and D are examples of pathological atrophy.

Correct Answer: B) It is a reversible change in which one adult cell type is replaced by another adult cell type Explanation: Metaplasia is a reversible process in which one adult cell type is replaced by another, typically in response to chronic irritation or inflammation. Metaplasia is a change in the phenotype of differentiated cells, often in response to chronic irritation, that makes cells better able to withstand stress. It is usually induced by an altered differentiation pathway of tissue stem cells and may result in reduced functions or an increased propensity for malignant transformation (Option A ruled out). It often represents an adaptive response in which one cell type that is sensitive to a particular stress is replaced by another cell type that is better able to withstand the adverse environment. Signals generated by cytokines, growth factors, and extracellular matrix components in the cells’ environment stimulate the metaplastic change.
