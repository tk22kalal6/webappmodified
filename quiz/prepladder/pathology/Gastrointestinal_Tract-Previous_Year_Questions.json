      "explanation": "cells, including enterocytes in the intestine. Hepcidin binds to ferroportin and induces its internalization and degradation. This leads to a decrease in iron export from the enterocyte into the plasma, thereby reducing iron absorption and availability. Incorrect Options: Option A. Transferrin Transferrin is a protein that binds to iron in the plasma and facilitates its transport. Hepcidin does not directly bind to transferrin. Instead, hepcidin regulates iron levels by binding to ferroportin. Option C. Ferritin Ferritin is an intracellular protein that stores iron. Hepcidin does not directly bind to ferritin. Instead, hepcidin regulates iron levels by modulating the activity of ferroportin, which in turn affects iron release from ferritin. Option D . Divalent metal transporter 1 Divalent metal transporter 1 (DMT1) is a transmembrane protein responsible for the uptake of iron from the lumen of the intestine into enterocytes. Hepcidin does not bind to DMT1. Its main target is ferroportin, which is involved in the release of iron from the enterocyte into the bloodstream. Reference: .",

Incorrect Options: Squamous Metaplasia (Option A) is the replacement of normal columnar epithelium with stratified squamous epithelium , typically due to chronic irritation (e.g., bronchial epithelium in smokers or the cervix). In Barrett's oesophagus , the reverse occurs, with squamous epithelium replaced by columnar epithelium . Severe Dysplasia (Option B) is disordered cellular growth and a precancerous condition . In Barrett's oesophagus , dysplasia (low-grade or high-grade) may arise as a progression from intestinal metaplasia toward adenocarcinoma , but it is not a defining feature-rather, a complication. Cuboidal Metaplasia (Option D) is not a recognised feature of Barrett's oesophagus or any other oesophagal condition.

      },
      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer C - Juvenile polyp Explanation: The clinical presentation and HPE image showing characteristic cystically dilated crypts & glands are suggestive of Juvenile polyp. Juvenile Polyps: Occurrence : Common in children under 5 years old; can be sporadic or syndromic. Size & Appearance : Typically less than 3 cm, pedunculated, smooth-surfaced, reddish with cystic spaces. Histology : Dilated glands filled with mucin and inflammatory debris, mixed inflammatory infiltrates, and sometimes attenuated muscularis mucosae. Pathogenesis : Linked to mucosal hyperplasia ; mutations in SMAD4 and BMPR1A (TGF- β pathway). Dysplasia : Rare in sporadic polyps but present in juvenile polyposis syndrome. Complications : Juvenile polyposis syndrome can lead to colonic adenocarcinoma (30-50% risk by age 45). Peutz-Jeghers Syndrome (Option A) is an autosomal dominant condition characterised by hamartomatous polyps throughout the gastrointestinal tract. While rectal polyps may occur in this syndrome, the histopathological image seen in this case is more indicative of juvenile polyps. Villous Adenoma (Option B) are adenomatous polyps commonly seen in adults, characterised by finger-like projections with abundant mucin production. Tubular Adenoma (Option D) are common adenomatous polyps found in adults, characterized by glandular structures with tubular architecture.",

        "D": "Polymorphic lipoma"
      },
      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer A - Myxoid liposarcoma The presence of a retroperitoneal mass with the molecular finding of t(12;16) translocation & image showing abundant ground substance, with branching capillaries and few immature adipocytes, is highly suggestive of Myxoid liposarcoma . Liposarcoma, malignant tumours of adipose tissue, is the most common type of sarcoma in adults. These tumours typically arise in the deep soft tissues of the proximal extremities and retroperitoneum, commonly affecting individuals in their sixth and seventh decades of life. Pathogenesis: The three subtypes of liposarcoma—well-differentiated, myxoid, and pleomorphic—have distinct genetic abnormalities: Well-differentiated liposarcomas exhibit amplifications in the chromosome region 12q13–q15, which includes the p53 inhibitor MDM2. Myxoid liposarcomas are characterised by a fusion gene caused by a t(12;16) translocation, which arrests adipocyte differentiation, leading to uncontrolled proliferation of primitive cells. Pleomorphic liposarcomas display complex karyotypes without consistent genetic abnormalities. Histopathological findings: Well-differentiated liposarcomas are composed primarily of mature adipocytes with scattered atypical spindle cells. Myxoid liposarcomas are characterised by a rich basophilic extracellular matrix, arborizing capillaries, and primitive cells at different stages of adipocyte differentiation, resembling fetal fat. Pleomorphic liposarcomas feature sheets of anaplastic cells with bizarre nuclei intermixed with varying numbers of immature adipocytes, called lipoblasts. Lipomas (Option B) are benign tumours made up of mature adipose tissue. They are typically well-defined and do not show the cellular atypia or genetic abnormalities associated with",

      "options": {
        "A": "Relaxation of LES",
        "B": "Increased peristalsis",
        "C": "Decreased release of NO and VIP in the distal esophagus",
        "D": "Decreased tone of LES"
      },
      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: C) Decreased release of NO and VIP in the distal esophagus Explanation: The clinical presentation & the bird beak sign on barium swallow suggests achalasia , a condition characterized by the inability of the lower esophageal sphincter (LES) to relax and an absence of peristalsis in the distal esophagus. It is caused by a decreased release of nitric oxide (NO) and vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP) , which are essential for smooth muscle relaxation. This results in increased tone of the LES and impaired peristalsis. Achalasia: Pathology: Incomplete LES relaxation/Increased LES tone/Aperistalsis of the esophagus Symptoms: Dysphagia (difficulty swallowing), Difficulty in belching, Chest pain Primary Achalasia: It is caused by degeneration of nitric oxide-producing neurons that normally induce LES relaxation. Degeneration of the extraesophageal vagus nerve or dorsal motor nucleus of the vagus may occur. Secondary Achalasia: Chagas disease (Trypanosoma cruzi infection) destroys the myenteric plexus, leading to peristalsis failure and esophageal dilation. Associated with conditions like: Diabetic autonomic neuropathy Infiltrative disorders (e.g., malignancy , amyloidosis , sarcoidosis ) Systemic sclerosis Dorsal motor nuclei lesions (post-polio) Down syndrome or Allgrove syndrome (achalasia, alacrima, ACTH-resistant adrenal insufficiency). Some cases linked to HSV1 infection , immunoregulatory gene polymorphisms, Sjögren syndrome , or autoimmune thyroid disease , suggesting immune-mediated destruction of inhibitory esophageal neurons. Treatment: Laparoscopic myotomy Pneumatic balloon dilation Botulinum neurotoxin (Botox) injections to inhibit cholinergic neuron contraction.

      "question": "Which of the following is true about the pathogenesis of Hirschsprung disease?",
      "options": {
        "A": "Failure of migration of neural crest cells",
        "B": "Increase in ganglion cells",
        "C": "Visceral myopathy",
        "D": "Obstruction by inflammatory strictures"
      },
      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: A) Failure of migration of neural crest cells Explanation: Hirschsprung disease arises when the migration of neural crest cells is arrested , causing a lack of ganglion cells (Option B ruled out) in the affected segment, leading to a lack of peristalsis in the affected bowel segment, causing functional obstruction and bowel dilation without inflammation or strictures (Option D ruled out) . This leads to aganglionosis, preventing peristalsis and causing bowel dilation. Morphology: Histopathological confirmation involves identifying the absence of ganglion cells, and acetylcholinesterase staining aids in diagnosis. The disease typically involves the rectum, with short-segment or long-segment Hirschsprung disease based on the extent of involvement. Clinical Features: Symptoms include failure to pass meconium, abdominal distension, constipation, and bilious vomiting. Complications such as enterocolitis, perforation, and peritonitis can occur. Surgical resection of the aganglionic segment is the primary treatment. Acquired Megacolon: Acquired Megacolon, seen in conditions like Chagas disease and ulcerative colitis , may share a similar pathophysiology with Hirschsprung disease, particularly in cases involving the loss of ganglion cells. Visceral myopathy (Option C) refers to smooth muscle dysfunction, which can affect gastrointestinal motility but is not the cause of Hirschsprung disease.

      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: B) Celiac disease Explanation: Celiac disease is an autoimmune disorder triggered by the ingestion of gluten in genetically predisposed individuals. The immune response leads to damage in the small intestine, causing malabsorption, diarrhea, and poor appetite. On histopathological examination, crypt hyperplasia, villous atrophy, and increased CD8+ T lymphocytes in the lamina propria are classic features of celiac disease.

It is commonly seen in individuals from regions with poor sanitation and hygiene. Whipple's disease (Option C) is a rare bacterial infection caused by Tropheryma whipplei . It primarily affects the small intestine but can also involve other organs. The biopsy findings in Whipple's disease are different and typically show PAS-positive macrophages. Chronic pancreatitis (Option D) is characterised by persistent inflammation and fibrosis of the pancreas, leading to impaired pancreatic function. It can cause malabsorption, but the biopsy would not show the characteristic findings of celiac disease, such as villous atrophy and crypt hyperplasia.",

      "explanation": "Correct Answer: B) 1, 2, 3 Explanation: Peutz-Jeghers Syndrome: Inheritance : Autosomal dominant. Age of Onset : Median age of 11 years. Key Features : Multiple GI hamartomatous polyps. Mucocutaneous hyperpigmentation (dark macules on lips, buccal mucosa, palms, genitalia, and perianal region). Polyps are most common in the small intestine but may also occur in the stomach, colon, bladder, and lungs. Complications: Risk of intussusception , potentially fatal. Increased cancer risk (lifetime risk ~40%), including cancers of the GI tract, testes, pancreas, breast, lung, ovarian, and uterus. Pathogenesis: It is caused by germline mutations in the STK11 gene, a tumour suppressor gene regulating cell polarization and growth. Somatic loss of the second STK11 gene copy in cancers. Morphology: Polyps are pedunculated and lobulated. Histology shows an arborizing network of smooth muscle, connective tissue, lamina propria, and glands. Congenital hypertrophy of retinal pigmental epithelium is not typically associated with Peutz-Jeghers syndrome . Congenital hypertrophy of the retinal pigment epithelium (CHTPE) is more commonly seen in other conditions, such as familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP) .",

Cell Type Location Function Stem cells Isthmus of gastric pits Regenerate the various types of gastric epithelial cells. Parietal cells Fundus and body of the stomach It secretes hydrochloric acid (HCl) and intrinsic factors that are important for digestion and vitamin B12 absorption. Chief cells Fundus and body of the stomach Secrete pepsinogen, which is converted to pepsin in the acidic environment, to aid in protein digestion. Mucous cells Surface epithelium of the stomach lining and neck of gastric pits Secrete mucus to protect the stomach lining from the acidic environment and digestive enzymes. Endocrine cells (G cells) Antrum of the stomach Secrete gastrin, which stimulates acid secretion by parietal cells and gastric motility. Enteroendocrine cells Throughout the gastric mucosa Secrete various hormones such as somatostatin, serotonin, and histamine to regulate gastric functions.",

      "correct_answer": "D",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: D) Zollinger-Ellison syndrome Explanation: The marked structure shows eosinophilic cells indicative of parietal cells. Zollinger-Ellison syndrome , which is characterized by excess gastrin secretion from tumours, is not related to the absence of parietal cells. Zollinger-Ellison syndrome: Cause : Gastrin-secreting neuroendocrine tumours ( gastrinomas ) located mainly in the small intestine or pancreas . Presentation : Duodenal ulcers Chronic diarrhoea Marked increase in oxyntic mucosal thickness due to parietal cell hyperplasia Gastrin also induces hyperplasia of the mucous neck and endocrine cells . Sporadic, solitary lesions in 75% of cases. Multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1 (MEN1) in 25% of cases and is associated with younger age, duodenal tumours, and metastasis. Treatment: Proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) block acid hypersecretion, promoting ulcer healing and preventing gastric perforation. Focus on treating the gastrinomas , which influence long-term survival. Pernicious Anemia (Option A) is an autoimmune disorder caused by the destruction of gastric parietal cells , leading to intrinsic factor deficiency. Since intrinsic factor is essential for vitamin B12 absorption in the intestines, its absence results in vitamin B12 deficiency . The loss of parietal cells is a hallmark of pernicious anaemia. Autoimmune Metaplastic Atrophic Gastritis (Option B) is an autoimmune condition that targets the parietal cells, causing hypochlorhydria (low stomach acid) and a decreased production of intrinsic factors. Vitamin B12 Deficiency (Option C) can arise from various causes, including pernicious anaemia or inadequate dietary intake. Pernicious anaemia occurs due to the loss or dysfunction of parietal cells , which produce intrinsic factors essential for vitamin B12 absorption. The resulting intrinsic factor deficiency impairs B12 absorption, leading to deficiency.",

      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: C) Celiac disease Explanation: Celiac Disease (also referred to as Gluten-sensitive Enteropathy or Celiac Sprue) is associated with Dermatitis herpetiformis. Celiac Disease Definition Autoimmune disorder triggered by ingesting gluten-containing foods in genetically susceptible individuals. It is influenced by HLA-DQ2 or HLA-DQ8. Pathogenesis Clinical features Adults: Commonly between the ages of 30 and 60. More frequent in females Silent celiac disease (positive serology and villous atrophy without symptoms) Latent celiac disease (positive serology is not accompanied by villous atrophy) It may be associated with chronic diarrhoea, bloating, chronic fatigue, or asymptomatic. Anaemia (iron and vitamin malabsorption). Dermatitis herpetiformis (itchy, blistering skin lesion) might be present. (Option C) Pediatric cases: Both sexes were affected equally. It may present with malabsorption. Begins after the introduction of gluten to the diet (6-24 months of age) Manifestations include irritability, abdominal distention, anorexia, chronic diarrhoea, failure to thrive, weight loss, or muscle wasting. It may also present as abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, bloating, or constipation. Extraintestinal complaints include arthritis or joint pain, aphthous stomatitis, iron deficiency anaemia, delayed puberty, and short stature. Serum markers IgA antibodies against tissue transglutaminase (tTG): Most sensitive. Anti-endomysial antibodies (EMA): Most specific. IgG antibodies against gliadin (a component of gluten). Histology Biopsy of the second part of the duodenum or proximal jejunum: Increased intraepithelial CD8+ T lymphocytes (intraepithelial lymphocytosis). Crypt hyperplasia (Increased mitosis). Villous atrophy (Reduced mucosal surface area, causing malabsorption). Inflammatory cell infiltration. Ulcerative colitis (Option A) is a chronic inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) that affects the colon and rectum. It causes ulceration and inflammation of the inner lining of the colon, leading to symptoms like bloody diarrhoea, abdominal pain, cramping, and weight loss. The condition is characterised by periods of flare-ups and remissions and is believed to have an autoimmune origin. Whipple’s disease (Option B) is a rare bacterial infection caused by Tropheryma whipplei . It primarily affects the small intestine, causing malabsorption, diarrhoea, and weight loss, and can also involve the joints, heart, nervous system, and lungs. It is characterised by PAS-positive macrophages in tissue samples. Crohn’s disease (Option D) is a chronic inflammatory bowel disease that can affect any part of the GI tract, causing symptoms like abdominal pain, diarrhoea, and weight loss. It involves transmural inflammation and skip lesions. The exact cause is unknown, but it’s linked to an autoimmune response.",

      "explanation": "Correct Answer: B) Fecal lactoferrin Explanation: Faecal lactoferrin is a sensitive and specific marker for intestinal inflammation , particularly in conditions like inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD). It is a glycoprotein released by the neutrophils. Fecal calprotectin and Fecal lactoferrin are both non-invasive biomarkers used to assess intestinal inflammation . They are particularly useful in the diagnosis and monitoring of IBD and in identifying and separating between inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and non-inflammatory conditions like irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). Incorrect Options: Procalcitonin (Option A) is a biomarker produced in response to bacterial infections , particularly sepsis. It's used to monitor bacterial infections and guide antibiotic therapy. It is not specific for intestinal inflammation . Tissue transglutaminase IgA (Option C) is an antibody commonly used in the diagnosis of celiac disease , an autoimmune disorder where the ingestion of gluten leads to intestinal damage. It is not a marker for general intestinal inflammation . High-sensitivity C-reactive protein (Option D) is a more sensitive version of CRP, often used to assess the risk of coronary artery disease. It increases in response to generalised inflammation and does not specifically pinpoint conditions like IBD. Reference: Harrison’s Principles of Internal Medicine, 21st Edition, Page 2475",
