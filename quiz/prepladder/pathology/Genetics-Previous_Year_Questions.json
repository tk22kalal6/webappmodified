      "explanation": "Correct Answer: A) Gynecomastia and long limbs Explanation: The karyotype image reveals an additional X chromosome, confirming the presence of Klinefelter Syndrome (47, XXY), a condition often associated with features like gynecomastia and longer limbs. It is male hypogonadism resulting from two or more X chromosomes and one or more Y chromosomes. It is an important genetic cause of reduced spermatogenesis and male infertility. Karyotype: The most common is 47, XXY, from meiotic nondisjunction; some have mosaic patterns (e.g., 46, XY/47, XXY). X chromosome genes: Some genes escape inactivation, leading to uneven dosage compensation and overexpression. Clinical features of Klinefelter syndrome: Gynecomastia (breast development) Long limbs Infertility (most common cause of male hypogonadism and infertility). Flat occiput (Option B) is a feature of Down syndrome (Trisomy 21), a genetic condition caused by an extra chromosome 21, leading to intellectual disability, developmental delays, and physical traits like a flat face and almond-shaped eyes. It’s linked to heart defects, hearing loss, and other health issues. Webbing of the neck and lymphedema (Option C) are features of Turner’s syndrome, a genetic condition that occurs when a female is born with only one full X chromosome (45, X instead of the usual 46, XX). It leads to short stature, infertility, and sometimes heart defects,",

        "C": "X-linked recessive",
        "D": "X-linked dominant"
      },
      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: A) Autosomal dominant Explanation: The interpretation of the pedigree chart given reveals Autosomal dominant inheritance , which means that an individual only needs one copy of the mutated gene to express the condition. Affected individuals appear in every generation, as one parent passes on the mutated gene to their offspring. Both males and females can be affected equally because the gene is located on one of the autosomes . If an affected person has children, there is a 50% chance that each child will inherit the mutated gene and be affected. Autosomal Recessive (Option B) inheritance is where the Individuals usually do not express the trait unless they inherit two copies of the mutation . This inheritance pattern typically has horizontal transmission and skip generations in between. X-linked recessive (Option C) disorders affect males more than females because males have only one X chromosome. Females need two copies of the mutation to be affected. Additionally, X-linked recessive disorders often show a pattern where affected males pass the mutated gene to all their daughters but none of their sons. X-linked dominan t (Option D) inheritance means an affected female can pass the condition to both sons and daughters, while an affected male passes it to all daughters but none of his sons. The question contradicts this pattern, so X-linked dominant is not the correct answer.",

      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: A) Glutamate by valine at the 6th position Explanation: Sickle cell anaemia is caused by a point mutation that involves substituting adenine for thymine at the sixth codon of the β -globin gene (GAG to GTG) , replacing glutamic acid (glutamate) with valine in the β -globin chain of haemoglobin. This single nucleotide change results in the formation of abnormal haemoglobin molecules (HbS) . After deoxygenation, HbS molecules polymerize to form bundles. These polymer bundles cause erythrocytes to adopt a sickle shape and also promote hemolysis of erythrocytes, releasing cell-free Hb into circulation.

      "explanation": "process allows the same gene for the heavy chain to be spliced in different ways to produce both IgM and IgD isotypes. The IgM and IgD are both produced from the same heavy chain gene but are differentiated through this splicing mechanism. During this process, the RNA transcript for the heavy chain is spliced in two different ways, one to produce IgM and the other to produce IgD . Both these antibodies have the same antigen-binding specificity but differ in their constant regions, which define their isotypes. Somatic hypermutation (Option A) occurs after antigen exposure and increases antibody affinity, but it does not affect the simultaneous expression of IgM and IgD. Affinity maturation (Option C) is a process that occurs during the immune response to improve the affinity of antibodies, not to generate multiple antibody classes at the same time. Allelic exclusion (Option D) ensures that only one allele of the immunoglobulin gene is expressed in a B cell at any given time, which helps in maintaining clonal specificity, but it does not explain the co-expression of IgM and IgD.

      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "parent the gene was inherited from. In imprinted genes, one allele is silenced depending on the parent of origin, leading to differential expression. Genomic imprinting: Inheritance : We inherit two copies of each autosomal gene, one from each parent, but functional differences can exist between the maternal and paternal alleles. Mechanism: Imprinting is an epigenetic process that selectively inactivates either the maternal or paternal allele. Maternal imprinting silences the maternal allele, while paternal imprinting silences the paternal allele. Imprinting occurs in the ovum or sperm before fertilization. The imprinting pattern is stably transmitted to somatic cells through mitosis. Imprinting is linked to disorders like Prader-Willi syndrome and Angelman syndrome. Prader-Willi syndrome Chromosome 15q SNORP gene Paternal deletion Maternal imprinting Angelman syndrome Chromosome 15q UBE3A gene Maternal deletion Paternal imprinting Gonadal mosaicism (Option A) refers to a condition where some of an individual's gametes (eggs or sperm) carry a mutation that is not present in the somatic cells. It does not involve differential expression based on the parent of origin, which is specific to genomic imprinting. Anticipation (Option C) refers to the phenomenon where a genetic disorder becomes more severe or appears at an earlier age with each successive generation. It is seen in trinucleotide repeat disorders. Incomplete penetrance (Option D) refers to situations where an individual with a disease-causing genotype does not show the expected phenotype. Example: BRCA1 gene mutations , which increase the risk of breast and ovarian cancer. Some individuals with the mutation never develop cancer despite carrying the gene.

      "explanation": "Correct Answer: B) B Explanation: \"B\" represents the acini, the functional units of the exocrine pancreas that produce and secrete digestive enzymes into the pancreatic ducts, and these are affected in Cystic Fibrosis, an autosomal recessive genetic disorder. Pathogenesis: It is caused by mutations in the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) gene, resulting in a defect in the production or function of the CFTR protein. This leads to thick, sticky mucus forming in various organs, including the pancreas. In the pancreas, the defective CFTR protein affects the secretion of chloride ions and water, dehydrating pancreatic secretions. This thickened mucus obstructs the pancreatic ducts, preventing the proper flow of digestive enzymes from the acini into the duodenum. (Option B) Consequently, there is a reduction in the production and release of pancreatic enzymes, leading to impaired digestion and malabsorption of nutrients.

      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: A) It is a trinucleotide repeat disorder Explanation: Huntington's chorea is a trinucleotide repeat disorder caused by the expansion of the CAG repeat in the HTT gene on chromosome 4. Huntington's disease: HD is an autosomal dominant disorder caused by the degeneration of striatal neurons, leading to a progressive movement disorder and dementia. Symptoms include chorea , bradykinesia, and rigidity. It is relentlessly progressive and fatal, typically over 15 years. Pathogenesis: HD is a trinucleotide repeat expansion disease caused by a CAG repeat (Option C) in the HTT gene on chromosome 4p16.3 (Option D) , encoding huntingtin protein . Normal HTT genes have 6 to 35 CAG repeats , while pathogenic mutations have expanded repeats, leading to earlier disease onset with paternal transmission causing anticipation & the toxic gain-of-function (Option B) of mutant huntingtin is believed to be the primary pathogenic mechanism. Morphology: The brain exhibits atrophy of the caudate nucleus and putamen , along with ventricular dilation . There is a loss of striatal neurons , particularly affecting GABAergic neurons in the caudate and putamen. Gliosis is more extensive than usual due to neuronal loss. Clinical features: The loss of striatal neurons results in increased motor activity, causing choreoathetosis . Cognitive decline follows, with symptoms such as forgetfulness and dementia . The disease usually manifests in the fourth or fifth decade , and motor symptoms typically precede cognitive symptoms . The leading cause of death is often pneumonia , especially in advanced stages. Suicide rates are higher in HD patients. Reference: Robbins & Cotran Pathologic Basis of Disease, 10th Edition, Page 174, 1285",

      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: B) Defect in DNA helicase Explanation: Werner syndrome , a rare autosomal recessive disorder, is characterised by premature ageing and accelerated development of age-related diseases. It results from mutations in the WRN gene, which encodes a DNA helicase involved in DNA repair and maintenance of genomic stability. Chromosomal damage accumulates rapidly due to the defective enzyme. This damage mimics normal ageing at a faster rate, leading to premature ageing. Similar conditions like Bloom syndrome and ataxia-telangiectasia also involve mutations in genes responsible for DNA repair . These disorders result in genetic instability and accelerated ageing due to impaired DNA repair mechanisms. Incorrect Options: Increased telomerase activity (Option A) is typically seen in some cancers, where it allows cells to maintain telomere length and avoid senescence. Increase in length of telomere due to decrease in telomerase activity (Option C) and Decreased telomerase activity (Option D) : In Werner syndrome, telomere shortening occurs due to DNA repair defects rather than telomere maintenance problems. Telomerase activity is not significantly altered. Reference: Robbins & Cotran Pathologic Basis of Disease, 10th Edition, Page 67",

X-Linked Recessive : The gene for Color blindness is located on the X chromosome. Males (XY) express the disorder if they inherit the affected X chromosome since they lack a second X for compensation. Females (XX) can be carriers if they inherit one affected X chromosome, often showing no symptoms due to the normal allele on the other X.

The syndrome can lead to a variety of physical and developmental features. The symptoms mentioned in the question are characteristic of Turner syndrome: Short stature: Girls with Turner syndrome often experience growth failure and have shorter-than-average height. Nipples widely placed: One of the physical features commonly seen in Turner syndrome is a wide spacing between the nipples. Primary amenorrhea: Girls with Turner syndrome typically have delayed or absent puberty, leading to the absence of menstrual periods. Incorrect Options: Option B: Down syndrome (trisomy 21) : Down syndrome is a genetic disorder caused by the presence of an extra copy of chromosome 21. It is characterized by distinct physical features, intellectual disability, and various health issues. However, the symptoms mentioned in the question, such as short stature, widely placed nipples, and primary amenorrhea, are not typical of Down syndrome. Therefore, Down syndrome is not the correct diagnosis in this case. Option C: Edward syndrome (trisomy 18) : Edward syndrome is a genetic disorder caused by the presence of an extra copy of chromosome 18. It is associated with multiple congenital abnormalities affecting various organ systems. However, the symptoms mentioned in the question, including short stature, widely placed",

      "explanation": "Correct Answer: C) Reciprocal translocation Explanation: The Philadelphia Chromosome is a reciprocal translocation involving chromosomes 9 and 22 that is commonly identified in CML (chronic myeloid leukaemia). The two chromosome breaks lie within: ABL gene on chromosome 9 BCR (breakpoint cluster region) gene on chromosome 22. Nonhomologous end-joining causes a reciprocal translocation , resulting in the formation of an oncogenic BCR-ABL fusion gene on the derivative chromosome 22, known as the Philadelphia chromosome. BCR-ABL fusion genes encode chimeric BCR-ABL proteins with constitutive tyrosine kinase activity. Inversion (Option A): In an inversion, a segment of a chromosome is flipped within the same chromosome but remains in its original location. Example of inversion-related disorder: Hemophilia A (due to intrachromosomal inversion in the F8 gene). Deletion (Option B) involves the loss of a chromosome segment, leading to missing genetic material. Example of deletion-related disorder: Cri-du-chat syndrome (chromosome 5p deletion) Insertion (Option D) occurs when a segment of one chromosome is inserted into another chromosome without reciprocal exchange. Example of insertion-related disorder: Some cases of hereditary cancer syndromes due to gene insertions. Reference: Robbins and Cotran Pathologic Basis of Disease, 10th Edition, Page 317.",

When two carriers have a child, there's a 25% chance the child will have the disorder, a 50% chance of being a carrier, and a 25% chance of having neither the disorder nor being a carrier. An example is cystic fibrosis. Option C - X-Linked Dominant Inheritance: X-linked dominant inheritance involves a mutated gene on the X chromosome. A single copy of the mutated gene on one of the X chromosomes is sufficient to cause the trait or disorder in females (since they have two X chromosomes) and in males (who have one X chromosome).",

      "question": "A 30-year-old pregnant woman who has the thalassemia trait visits the clinic for genetic counseling. Her husband is also confirmed to have the thalassemia trait. Considering their genetic background, what is the likelihood of their next offspring having thalassemia?",
      "options": {
        "A": "100%",
        "B": "50%",
        "C": "75%",
        "D": "25%"
      },
      "correct_answer": "D",
      "explanation": "Punnett square analysis shows that there's a 25% chance for their offspring to inherit two mutated copies of the gene (one from each parent), resulting in thalassemia. There is a 50% chance of inheriting one normal and one mutated gene (being a carrier like the parents), and a 25% chance of inheriting two normal copies of the gene. Incorrect Options: Option A - 100%: This would mean that all of their offspring would definitely have thalassemia, which is not the case. Thalassemia is an autosomal recessive genetic disorder, meaning that both copies of the gene need to carry the mutation for the disorder to manifest. Since both parents have thalassemia trait, they each carry one normal copy of the gene and one mutated copy. Therefore, there is a chance that their offspring may inherit one normal copy from one parent and one mutated copy from the other, resulting in carrying the thalassemia trait, but not necessarily having thalassemia. Option B - 50%: This would imply that each offspring has a 50% chance of having thalassemia. While it's true that each child has a 50% chance of inheriting the mutated gene from either parent, the probability of them having thalassemia depends on both copies of the gene being mutated, which is less likely. Option C - 75%: This would suggest that there's a higher likelihood of having thalassemia than not. However, the probability of an offspring having thalassemia is not this high. It's important to remember that the trait they both have is the heterozygous form (thalassemia trait), which means they each have one normal gene and one mutated gene. This significantly reduces the probability of their offspring having thalassemia",
