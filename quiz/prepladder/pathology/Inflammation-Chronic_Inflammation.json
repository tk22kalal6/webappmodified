      "explanation": "Correct Answer: C) d, b, c, a Explanation: Epithelioid Cells (label b): Activated macrophages transform into epithelioid cells, resembling epithelial cells with pink granular cytoplasm and indistinct cell boundaries. Lymphocytes (label d): These surround the clusters of epithelioid cells, forming a collar. They play a vital role (mainly T cells) in the immune response to antigens presented by the epithelioid cells. Langhans Giant Cell (label c) : These multinucleated giant cells are derived from the fusion of activated macrophages and are often found in the later stages of granuloma formation. Caseous Necrosis (label a): In granulomas associated with certain infections like Mycobacterium tuberculosis, a central zone of caseous necrosis may form due to hypoxia and free radical-mediated injury, resulting in the characteristic cheesy appearance of the necrotic material. granuloma - caseous necrosis\" data-author=\"\" data-hash=\"1775\" data-license=\"\" data-source=\"\" data-tags=\"\" src=\"https://image.prepladder.com/notes/R91a9bxRPsSaiqAx4mDz1742966405.png\" /> Reference: Robins and Cotran Pathologic Basis of Disease, 10th Edition, - Pages 100, 101",

      "explanation": "Correct Answer: B) Keloid Explanation: The most likely diagnosis for a raised scar on the patient’s chest is Keloid characterized by abnormal and excessive growth of scar tissue that grows beyond the boundaries of the original wound and does not regress. It typically appears firm, raised, and extends beyond the margins of the initial injury. Keloid formation seems to be an individual predisposition, and it is more common in African Americans. Sternum is the most common site for Keloid formation. Treatment can be done by intralesional injection of steroids like Triamcinolone. Hypertrophic scar : (option A) While hypertrophic scars are also raised, they typically remain within the boundaries of the original injury. They may regress over time and are less likely to recur after treatment compared to keloids. Exuberant granulation tissue(Option C) Exuberant granulation tissue,",

      "explanation": "Correct Answer: D) Endothelial cells in blood vessels Explanation: Endothelial cells in blood vessels are examples of stable cells. Classification of cells based on the proliferative capacity and turnover rate: Labile cells Stable cells Permanent cells These cells are continuously being lost and replaced by maturation from tissue stem cells and by the proliferation of mature cells. Labile cells include hematopoietic cells in the bone marrow (Option B) and the majority of surface epithelia (Option C) They are quiescent and have minimal proliferative activity from progenitor cells. They divide only when required but limited regeneration compared to labile cells. Stable cells constitute the parenchyma of most solid tissues(liver), endothelial cells (Option D) , fibroblasts, and smooth muscle cells. These cells are considered to be terminally differentiated and nonproliferative in postnatal life. Permanent cells include Neurons (Option A) and cardiac and skeletal muscle cells.
