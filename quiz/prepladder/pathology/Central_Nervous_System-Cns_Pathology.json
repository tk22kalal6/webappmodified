They are characterized by their slow growth and relatively benign behavior. The histopathology shows bipolar cells with elongated processes and characteristic eosinophilic inclusions like Rosenthal fibers and mulberry bodies (eosinophilic granular bodies) These tumors are often well-demarcated and cystic , with a contrast-enhancing mural nodule seen on imaging. Glomeruloid bodies (Option B) : Glomeruloid bodies are a characteristic feature of Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM). Negri bodies (Option C) : Negri bodies are eosinophilic, inclusion bodies typically found in neurons infected with the rabies virus Lewy bodies (Option D): Lewy bodies are eosinophilic cytoplasmic inclusions composed primarily of alpha-synuclein protein.

Alzheimer's Disease is the most common cause of dementia in the elderly. It affects the frontal, parietal, and temporal lobes (Statement 4). It occurs due to the mutation of the APP gene on Chromosome 21 (Statement 1). If APP is processed by alpha and gamma-secretase pathways, products are soluble and do not deposit in the brain, and there is no disease. (Statement 2). If the beta-secretase pathway processes APP, it produces amyloid products, which are pathogenic. APOE2 is considered a protective factor for Alzheimer's Disease (Statement 3).

Correct Answer: D) Homozygous mutation of glucocerebrosidase is an important risk factor for this condition Explanation: The clinical vignette of resting tremors, early morning stiffness, unsteadiness, shuffling gait, and cogwheel rigidity is suggestive of Parkinson’s disease. Homozygous mutations in glucocerebrosidase cause Gaucher’s disease , a lysosomal storage disorder. Parkinson’s Disease (PD): Autosomal dominant PD is SNCA , a gene that encodes α -synuclein . This protein is a major component of the Lewy body, which is the diagnostic hallmark of PD. Autosomal recessive forms of PD, are caused by gene mutations that encode the proteins DJ-1, PINK1, and parkin (Option B) . Mutations in the gene encoding LRRK2 (leucine-rich repeat kinase 2) are the most common cause of autosomal dominant PD (Option C) . Clinical Features: Triad of tremor, rigidity, and bradykinesia.
