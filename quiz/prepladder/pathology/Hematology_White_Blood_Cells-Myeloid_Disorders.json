        "D": "Primary Myelofibrosis (PMF)"
      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Correct answer: B)Essential Thrombocytosis (ET) Explanation: Essential thrombocytosis is a type of myeloproliferative neoplasm which is characterized by isolated thrombocytosis without any without significant leukocytosis or erythrocytosis , along with increased megakaryocytes in bone marrow biopsy It is asymptomatic in more than half of the cases and is usually diagnosed incidentally Less than 50% patients have symptoms related to thrombosis or hemorrhage Symptoms include Bleeding tendency Microvascular occlusion Thrombosis of major arteries (leading to CVA and transient ischemic attacks), and vasomotor symptoms such as headache, visual disturbances, and syncope. Mild splenomegaly and rarely hepatomegaly and lymphadenopathy Diagnosis Criteria for Early/Prefibrotic ET Sustained platelet count ≥ 450 x 10^9/L Megakaryocyte proliferation Absence of criteria for other myeloid neoplasms Absence of JAK2, CALR, or MPL mutation Polycythemia Vera (PV) (Option A): It is characterized by increased red blood cell mass, leading to erythrocytosis. Associated with JAK2 mutation Symptoms : headaches, dizziness, and pruritus due to hyperviscosity. Laboratory findings typically include elevated hemoglobin and hematocrit levels, leukocytosis, and thrombocytosis. Bone marrow biopsy shows hypercellularity with increased erythropoiesis Chronic Myeloid Leukemia (Option C): CML is characterized by the Philadelphia chromosome (BCR-ABL fusion gene). Patients present with leukocytosis, predominantly neutrophils, and may have splenomegaly. Laboratory findings- elevated white blood cell count, left-shifted granulocytes, and basophilia. Treatment often involves tyrosine kinase inhibitors targeting the BCR-ABL fusion protein. Primary Myelofibrosis (PMF) (Option D): It is characterized by bone marrow fibrosis, leading to cytopenias and splenomegaly. Symptoms- fatigue, weight loss, and abdominal discomfort due to splenomegaly. Laboratory findings: anemia, leukoerythroblastosis, and teardrop-shaped red blood cells (dacrocytes) on peripheral smears. JAK2 mutation is commonly found in PMF Bone marrow biopsy shows fibrosis with increased megakaryocytes.",

      "question": "A 50-year-old male presents with complaints of headaches, dizziness, and pruritus. Physical examination reveals a plethora and splenomegaly. Laboratory tests show elevated hemoglobin and hematocrit levels. Which of the following criteria are consistent with the Polycythemia Vera (PV) diagnosis? ≥ 450 x 10^9/L",
      "options": {
        "A": "Sustained platelet count",
        "B": "Increased red blood cell mass",

      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Correct answer: B) Increased red blood cell mass Explanation: Diagnostic Criteria of Polycythemia Vera: Major criteria: Hb: > 16.5 g/dL in men and 16 g/dL in women. Hct: > 49% in men and > 48% in women. BM Trilineage myeloproliferative with pleomorphic megakaryocytes. Presence of JAK2 mutation. Minor Criteria: Subnormal serum erythropoietin level. Clinical features: Increased Hb causes stasis and neurological abnormalities. Increased TLC causes itching after a hot water bath and flushing. A high platelet count causes bleeding tendencies. Hepatosplenomegaly. Sustained platelet count ≥ 450 x 10^9/L (Option A): This criterion is not indicative of polycythemia vera (PV). Instead, it is a characteristic of Essential Thrombocytosis (ET), which is characterized by isolated thrombocytosis without significant erythrocytosis or leukocytosis. Presence of JAK2 mutation (Option C): While the presence of JAK2 mutation is a major diagnostic criterion for PV, it is not the only criterion. The presence of JAK2 mutations may also be observed in other myeloproliferative neoplasms like Essential Thrombocythemia (ET) or Primary Myelofibrosis (PMF). Presence of CALR or MPL mutation (Option D): CALR and MPL mutations are typically associated with other myeloproliferative neoplasms, such as Essential Thrombocythemia (ET) or Primary Myelofibrosis (PMF), and are not specific to Polycythemia Vera (PV).

      },
      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Correct answer: C) Bone marrow biopsy typically shows increased reticulin fibrosis. Explanation: The clinical presentation is consistent with Essential Thrombocytosis, which typically does not show a significant increase in reticulin fibers in the bone marrow at diagnosis. Increased reticulin fibrosis is more characteristic of primary myelofibrosis. WHO diagnostic criteria of Essential thrombocytosis Major criteria Platelet count greater than or equal to 450,000/microliter. Bone marrow biopsy Shows proliferation, mainly of the megakaryocytic lineage, with an increase in enlarged mature megakaryocytes. (Option A) No significant increase or left shift in neutrophil granulopoiesis or erythropoiesis is present, Very rarely a minor increase in reticulin fibers. (Option C) The presentation does not meet WHO criteria for BCR-ABL1 +ve CML, PCV, myelofibrosis, MDS, or other myeloid neoplasms. Presence of JAK2, CALR, or MPL mutation. (Option B) Minor criteria: Presence of a clonal marker or absence of evidence of reactive thrombocytosis.

      },
      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "Correct answer: A) All statements are true Explanation: Primary myelofibrosis (PMF) is a chronic myeloproliferative neoplasm characterized by the development of extensive marrow fibrosis, which impairs normal hematopoiesis. (Statement 1) This fibrosis is driven by the inappropriate release of fibrogenic factors, such as platelet-derived growth factor and TGF- β , from neoplastic megakaryocytes. (Statement 3) Clinically, PMF presents with progressive anemia, splenomegaly, and symptoms like fatigue and weight loss. WHO diagnostic criteria: Major criteria Megakaryocyte proliferation and atypia, usually with reticulin or collagen fibrosis. Not meeting WHO criteria for BCR-ABL1 + CML, PV, ET, MDS, or other myeloid neoplasm Presence of JAK2, CALR, or MPL mutation or in the absence of these mutations, presence of other clonal markers or absence of minor reactive BM reticulin fibrosis. (Statement 2) Minor criteria: Leukocytosis ≥ 11 × 10 9 /L. Increased Serum Lactate Dehydrogenase (LDH). Anemia not attributed to another condition. Palpable Splenomegaly.",

        "A": "Dry tap",
        "B": "Leukoerythroblastic blood picture",
        "C": "Dacrocytes",
        "D": "Myeloblasts"
      },
      "correct_answer": "D",
      "explanation": "Correct answer: D) Myeloblasts Explanation: Myeloblasts are seen in AML and are not associated with myelofibrosis. Myelofibrosis is the development of obliterative marrow fibrosis. Replacement of the marrow by fibrous tissue reduces bone marrow hematopoiesis, leading to cytopenias and extensive extramedullary hematopoiesis. Investigations include CBC- pancytopenia due to obliterative bone marrow fibrosis Peripheral smear reveals a leukoerythroblastic blood picture where the distortion of the marrow leads to the premature release of immature erythroid and granulocyte (Option B) Teardrop-shaped red cells (dacrocytes) that are damaged during the birthing process in the fibrotic marrow (Option C) Bone marrow aspirate may reveal a dry tap. (Option A) May reveal thickening and distortion of bony trabeculae and deposition of reticulin and collagen fibers.

      "correct_answer": "D",
      "explanation": "Correct answer: D) Pawn ball megakaryocyte Explanation: Pawn ball megakaryocytes is associated with Myelodysplastic syndrome. Myelodysplastic Syndrome (MDS) is a group of clonal stem cell disorders characterized by maturation defects and ineffective hematopoiesis with a risk transformation to AML Bone marrow replaced by clonal progeny of a neoplastic multipotent stem cell Leading to ineffective and disordered differentiation Can cause cytopenias and potential malignancy Genetic Causes Adults: Deletion of 5q chromosome Children: Monosomy 7 Types Primary (idiopathic) Secondary (due to genotoxic drugs or radiation therapy) Peripheral Smear Findings: Dysplastic differentiation of erythroid, granulocytic, monocytic, and megakaryocytic lineages Ring sideroblasts Erythroblasts with iron-laden mitochondria (visible as perinuclear granules in Prussian blue stain) Neutrophils with decreased secondary granules Döhle bodies PseudoPelger–Hüet cells (neutrophils with two nuclear lobes) Megakaryocytes with Single nuclear lobes Multiple separate nuclei (Pawnball megakaryocytes) Ringed sideroblasts: Döhle bodies: PseudoPelger–Hüet cells: Hyperlobated megakaryocytes (Option A): These are seen in Essential thrombocytosis, where peripheral smears reveal abnormally large platelets and marked thrombocytosis. It is characterized by erythromelalgia, a throbbing and burning of hands and feet caused by the occlusion of small arterioles by platelet aggregates. Leukoerythroblastic picture (Option B): This is seen in Myelofibrosis, which causes obliterative marrow fibrosis, decreasing hematopoiesis and causing cytopenias, with extensive extramedullary hematopoiesis. Increased proliferation of RBCs (Option C): It is seen in Polycythemia Vera due to JAK2 mutation. Patients present with symptoms such as headaches, dizziness, and pruritus due to hyperviscosity. Bone marrow biopsy shows hypercellularity with increased erythropoiesis.",
