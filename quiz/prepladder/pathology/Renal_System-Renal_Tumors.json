      "explanation": "Correct Answer: A) Neuropils Explanation: Neuropils are eosinophilic fibrillary material surrounded by concentric groups of tumour cells ( Homer-Wright pseudorosettes ) seen in the histopathological examination of neuroblastoma. They are not seen in Wilm’s tumour. Characteristics Wilms Tumor Neuroblastoma Location Kidney Most common abdominal tumor in childhood Common site: adrenal medulla, Also seen in abdomen, pelvis & neck. Most common primary renal tumor in childhood. Histological features Blastemal : Small blue cells. (Option B ruled out) Epithelial : Abortive tubules/glomeruli. Stromal : Fibroblastic or myxoid. (Option D ruled out) Small blue cells with neuroblasts, neurofibrils (neuropils) (Option A) , and mature ganglion cells Pseudo-rosettes (arrangements of small, round neuroblastic cells around a central fibrillary core) Histological image Below are the other components that might also be found in histological features of Wilm’s tumour: Squamous or mucinous epithelium. Smooth muscle. Adipose tissue (Option C ruled out). Cartilage. Osteoid. Neurogenic tissue. It is important to remember that around 5% of nephroblastoma is anaplastic, characterised by cells with large , hyperchromatic , pleomorphic nuclei and abnormal mitoses .

      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: C) Contralateral tumour Explanation: Nephrogenic rests are precursor or preneoplastic lesions of Wilms tumours, seen in the renal parenchyma adjacent to approximately. Hence, It is important to document the presence of nephrogenic rests in the resected specimen because these patients are at an increased risk of developing Wilms tumours in the contralateral kidney and require frequent and regular surveillance for many years.

Oncocytoma does not show perinuclear halo whereas chromophobe RCC shows perinuclear halo. Chromophobe RCC cannot be histologically graded because of its innate nuclear atypia.
