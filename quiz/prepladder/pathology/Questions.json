      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "aneurysms, also known as intracranial or saccular aneurysms, are localized outpouchings or dilations of blood vessels in the brain. The primary underlying cause is a defect in the arterial internal elastic lamina, which weakens the vessel wall and predisposes it to aneurysm formation. Incorrect Option: Option A. Endothelial injury of vessel due to HTN: This option is incorrect. While hypertension (HTN) can contribute to the weakening of blood vessels over time, it is not the primary cause of berry aneurysms. HTN can increase the risk of rupture in a pre-existing aneurysm, but it does not directly lead to the formation of berry aneurysms. Option C. Endothelial layer defect: This option is incorrect. While defects in the endothelial layer can contribute to vascular diseases, they are not the primary cause of berry aneurysms. The structural defect in the arterial internal elastic lamina is the main factor involved in the development of berry aneurysms. Option D. Adventitia defect: This option is incorrect. The adventitia is the outermost layer of blood vessels and plays a role in providing structural support. However, a defect in the adventitia is not the primary cause of berry aneurysms. The defect in the arterial internal elastic lamina is the main factor contributing to the formation of these aneurysms.",

      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: B) Endothelial injury Explanation: Thrombosis is initiated by endothelial injury, which exposes underlying collagen and pro-coagulant factors, leading to platelet activation and adhesion. This triggers the coagulation cascade, resulting in thrombus formation. Endothelial injury is considered the primary event that starts the sequence leading to thrombosis. Virchow’s triad is a concept used to explain the three primary factors that contribute to the development of thrombosis Endothelial Injury : Damage to the inner lining of blood vessels (endothelium) can lead to the exposure of underlying tissues, such as collagen and tissue factor, which activate the clotting process. Conditions like atherosclerosis, trauma, or inflammation can cause endothelial injury. Abnormal Blood Flow (Stasis or Turbulence) : Disruptions in normal blood flow, such as slow or stagnant blood flow (stasis) or turbulent flow, can promote clot formation. This is commonly seen in conditions like atrial fibrillation, prolonged immobility, or varicose veins. Hypercoagulability : An increased tendency of the blood to clot, which can be due to genetic factors (such as factor V Leiden mutation), acquired conditions (such as cancer or pregnancy), or certain medications that contribute to thrombosis.

      "correct_answer": "D",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: D) Eosinophilic contraction band Explanation: Eosinophilic contraction bands are a hallmark feature of reperfusion injury in the myocardium. Reperfusion injury: Intracellular calcium overload is the most likely the primary mechanism responsible for the reperfusion injury in this patient. During PCI, reperfusion of the occluded coronary artery can lead to a sudden influx of calcium into cardiomyocytes, known as calcium paradox , which can cause cell injury and dysfunction. This phenomenon is characterised by increased mitochondrial calcium levels, leading to mitochondrial permeability transition pore opening, mitochondrial dysfunction, and cell death. The presence of 'Contraction bands' in cardiac muscle tissue serves as histological markers of reperfusion injury.

      "explanation": "Correct Answer: A) Kawasaki disease Explanation: The classic features of this disease are the swelling of hands and feet, rash, and the other symptoms described in the case, making Kawasaki disease the most likely diagnosis. It is an acute, febrile, usually self-limited illness of infancy and childhood associated with large- to medium-sized vessel arteritis . 80% of the patients are younger than 4 years of age. It presents with fever, conjunctival injection, desquamative rash, erythema of palms and soles, oral erythema (strawberry tongue), and cervical lymphadenopathy. Coronary arteritis can result in aneurysms that rupture or thrombose, causing myocardial infarction . In genetically susceptible persons, a variety of infectious agents (mostly viral) have been posited to trigger the disease. The vasculitis may result from a delayed-type hypersensitivity response directed against cross-reactive or newly uncovered vascular antigens. Subsequent cytokine production and polyclonal B-cell activation result in autoantibodies to ECs and SMCs that precipitate the vasculitis. Clinical Features Mnemonic: CREAM-F. C onjunctivitis (non-exudative & non-purulent). R ash (Polymorphous, non-vesicular). E dema (or erythema of hands & feet). A denopathy (Cervical, often unilateral & non-suppurative). M ucosal involvement (Erythema or fissures or crusting at times, referred to as strawberry tongue). F ever (Most important constitutional symptom) . The image below shows the strawberry tongue. Measles (Option B) is a viral infection characterised by a maculopapular rash, Koplik spots in the mouth, and fever. It does not present with the swelling of hands and feet or the specific oral erythema seen in Kawasaki disease. Scarlet fever (Option C) is caused by a group A Streptococcus infection , typically presenting with a sandpaper-like rash, fever, and sore throat. It does not cause the desquamative rash or the extensive lymphadenopathy seen in Kawasaki disease. Henoch-Schonlein purpura (Option D) is a small vessel vasculitis commonly presenting with purpura, abdominal pain, and arthritis. The signs of erythema of palms and soles and the specific rash described are not characteristic of this condition.",

This patient’s symptoms of migratory arthritis, pan-systolic murmur, and mitral regurgitation, along with the characteristic granulomatous lesions, point to rheumatic heart disease caused by rheumatic fever . Histopathological features of RHD Aschoff bodies They are focal areas of inflammation with infiltration of lymphocytes, plasma cells and activated macrophages or histiocytes. An endomyocardial biopsy showing Aschoff's bodies helps in confirming the diagnosis of RHD. Anitschkow cells They are activated macrophages with elongated and wavy nuclei commonly found within Aschoff bodies. They appear as caterpillars in longitudinal sections (hence also called Caterpillar cells) and owls in cross sections. Fibrinoid necrosis This is seen in areas of the valves affected by inflammation. Granulation tissue is seen in cases of repair. It comprises proliferating blood vessels, inflammatory cells and fibroblasts. Epithelioid granuloma (Option B) is a characteristic feature of tuberculosis and other granulomatous diseases (like sarcoidosis). These granulomas are not typically seen in rheumatic fever.

      "correct_answer": "D",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: D) Henoch-Schonlein purpura Explanation: The child’s presentation of palpable blanching purpura, abdominal pain, arthritis (joint pain), hematuria and proteinuria is most consistent with Henoch-Schonlein purpura (HSP). Henoch-Schönlein Purpura (IgA vasculitis) Definition It is a systemic vasculitis characterised by inflammation of small blood vessels , primarily affecting children, but can also occur in adults. Etiology Often follows upper respiratory tract infections Pathology Immune complex deposition of IgA in small blood vessels leads to inflammation Clinical features Inflammation of small blood vessels primarily affects children but can also occur in adults. Associated with elevated serum IgA levels Skin : Palpable purpura, most prominently on the lower limbs and buttocks. Musculoskeletal : Arthralgia or arthritis, often transient and non-deforming. Gastrointestinal : Abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, and sometimes gastrointestinal bleeding, Intussusception is a severe but rare complication. Renal : Hematuria, proteinuria, and red blood cell casts in urine. It can progress to IgA nephropathy in severe cases. Management Supportive care : Hydration, rest, and pain management with NSAIDs for arthralgia. Glucocorticoids : For severe abdominal pain, renal involvement, or systemic symptoms. Intussusception : Surgical intervention if required. Nephritis : Immunosuppressants (e.g., cyclophosphamide) in severe cases. Immune thrombocytopenic purpura (Option A) is characterised by isolated thrombocytopenia without significant involvement of other systems. The purpura is typically non-blanching and is not associated with arthritis, abdominal pain, or renal symptoms. Dengue (Option B) often presents with high fever, rash, severe headache, and retro-orbital pain. While petechiae can occur, Dengue is not commonly associated with purpura or renal involvement. Churg-Strauss syndrome (Option C) is also called Eosinophilic Granulomatosis with Polyangiitis and is a vasculitis that is associated with asthma , eosinophilia , and granulomatous inflammation . It is part of the group of ANCA-associated vasculitis . It normally does not present with palpable purpura or renal involvement, as seen in HSP.

      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: A) Endo-myocardial biopsy Explanation: Endo-myocardial biopsy is considered the gold standard investigation for the diagnosis of myocarditis. It involves obtaining a small tissue sample from the endocardium or the myocardium to examine it under a microscope. This biopsy allows for direct visualization of the cardiac tissue and assessment of cellular inflammation, the presence of viral particles, and other histopathological changes characteristic of myocarditis. Myocarditis It is a diverse group of pathologic entities in which infectious microorganisms and/or a primary inflammatory process cause myocardial injury. Pathogenesis Infections: Viruses (e.g., Coxsackievirus, Echovirus, Influenza, HIV, Cytomegalovirus) Chlamydiae (e.g., Chlamydophila psittaci) Rickettsiae (e.g., Rickettsia typhi, Typhus fever) Bacteria (e.g., Corynebacterium diphtheriae, Neisseria meningococcus, Borrelia) Fungi (e.g., Candida) Protozoa (e.g., Trypanosoma cruzi [Chagas disease], toxoplasmosis) Helminths (e.g., Trichinosis) Immune-Mediated Reactions Postviral Poststreptococcal (Rheumatic fever) Systemic lupus erythematosus Drug hypersensitivity (e.g., methyldopa, sulfonamides) Transplant rejection Immune checkpoint inhibitor therapies Unknown Sarcoidosis Giant cell myocarditis Clinical features It can be asymptomatic (recovery without sequelae) Heart failure Arrhythmias Sudden death Symptoms include fatigue, dyspnea, palpitations, precordial discomfort, and fever. Magnetic Resonance Imaging (Option B) can offer valuable supportive evidence for diagnosing myocarditis, but it is not regarded as the gold standard. Cardiac MRI can reveal myocardial oedema, inflammation, and tissue characterization through specific sequences like T2-weighted imaging and late gadolinium enhancement. Brain Natriuretic Peptide (BNP) (Option C) is a hormone secreted by the heart in response to increased stretching of the cardiac chambers, commonly observed in conditions like heart failure. Although BNP levels can be elevated in myocarditis due to associated cardiac dysfunction, it is not a specific test for diagnosing myocarditis. LDH1 to LDH2 ratio (Option D) is not a specific diagnostic marker for myocarditis. Lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) is an enzyme present in various tissues, including the heart. In myocarditis, LDH levels may be elevated due to myocardial injury. Reference: Robbins & Cotran Pathologic Basis of Disease,10th Edition, Page 575-577.",

It is caused by an autoimmune reaction following a Group A Streptococcus infection. Predisposing factor: Acute Rheumatic fever typically occurs 2-3 weeks after the onset of Streptococcal pharyngitis (Group A beta-hemolytic Streptococci). Pathogenesis: Acute rheumatic fever (ARF) results from an immune response to group A streptococcal antigens, particularly the M proteins, which can cross-react with host proteins, including cardiac self-antigens. This molecular mimicry produces antibodies and activates CD4+ T cells that ultimately cause inflammation and tissue damage, particularly in the heart. Histopathological findings: Involve changes in the heart valves due to chronic inflammation and scarring. They include: Aschoff bodies: Consist of areas of chronic inflammation infiltrated with lymphocytes, plasma cells, and activated macrophages or histiocytes known as Anitshkow cells. Anitshkow cells: These are activated macrophages with a characteristic “caterpillar-like appearance” due to the presence of a central, slender and wavy nucleus. Fibrinoid necrosis results from the deposition of fibrin and inflammatory cells and is seen in areas of the valves affected by inflammation. Complications of RHD: Valvular stenosis and regurgitation Heart failure Arrhythmias, particularly atrial fibrillation in the setting of mitral stenosis Pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) Recurrence of acute rheumatic fever Cardio-embolic stroke Cardiomyopathy Infective endocarditis Ruptured heart valve.

      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: A) IgA vasculitis Explanation: The scenario of colicky abdominal pain, joint pain, palpable purpura, and hematuria without proteinuria suggests Henoch-Schönlein Purpura (IgA Vasculitis). It is an IgA-mediated small vessel vasculitis characterized by inflammation of small blood vessels. The exact cause of HSP is unclear, but it is thought to involve an abnormal immune response, where IgA immune complexes deposit in blood vessel walls, causing inflammation and damage. It is more common in children but can occur in adults. It is characterized by Henoch Schonlein purpura (palpable purpura) Purpuric rash in lower limbs Abdominal pain Arthralgia Renal (hematuria) It is associated with elevated serum IgA levels. Urinalysis: The presence of red blood cells cast in urine. Granulomatosis with polyangiitis (GPA) (Option B) , also known as Wegener's granulomatosis , is an autoimmune condition that primarily affects the small- to medium-sized blood vessels, leading to granulomatous inflammation and necrosis. It involves respiratory symptoms and renal issues, while Henoch-Schönlein Purpura (HSP) is more likely here due to abdominal pain, joint pain, and palpable purpura, which are hallmark features of HSP with IgA deposition. Microscopic polyangiitis (MPA) (Option C) is a small-vessel vasculitis primarily affecting the kidneys and lungs, often presenting with rapidly progressive glomerulonephritis and pulmonary symptoms like hemoptysis, along with ANCA positivity. Behcet's disease (Option D) is a systemic vasculitis that presents with oral and genital ulcers, ocular involvement, and skin lesions like erythema nodosum.

      "correct_answer": "D",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: D) Heart fatty acid binding protein Explanation: H-FABP(Heart fatty acid binding protein) is the earliest marker to rise in a case of myocardial infarction (MI). Cardiac Markers Cardiac Troponin (Troponin T and I) (Option B ruled out) Preferred biochemical markers due to their sensitivity and specificity. Troponin levels: Increase within 3-6 hours. Peak at around 36 hours. Remains elevated for 7-10 days after STEMI. Troponin should be measured at presentation and repeated at 1-3 hours (high-sensitivity assays) or 3-6 hours (conventional assays). Cardiac troponin levels remain elevated for several days after an acute myocardial infarction (AMI), making them unreliable for detecting reinfarction. Creatine Phosphokinase (CK) and CK-MB (Option A ruled out) CK rises within 4-8 hours. Peaks by 24 hours. Returns to normal within 48-72 hours. CK-MB elevated: Cardiac surgery Myocarditis Electrical cardioversion CK-MB levels normalise within 48 to 72 hours, so a subsequent rise can confirm reinfarction. Lactate Dehydrogenase (LDH) (Option C ruled out) Increase in the blood 6 to 12 hours after ACS. Peak within 24 to 72 hours. Normalise within 8 to 14 days. LDH is no longer used to diagnose myocardial infarction because it is not specific to cardiac myocytes. Heart-type Fatty Acid-Binding Protein (H-FABP) (Option D) It is the earliest marker to rise in a case of myocardial infarction (MI). It has higher sensitivity than troponin and CK-MB for detecting AMI within 4 hours of symptom onset, but its specificity is lower.

Etiology: Viral infections (e.g., enteroviruses, adenoviruses) Postviral reactions Autoimmune diseases (e.g., systemic lupus erythematosus, rheumatoid arthritis) Idiopathic cases (unknown cause) Pathological finding: Lymphocytic infiltration : Predominantly, lymphocytes infiltrate the myocardium, especially in the left ventricle. Myocyte necrosis : The inflammation leads to the death of myocardial cells. Fibrosis : Chronic cases may develop fibrosis and scarring in the heart tissue. Dilated cardiomyopathy : Severe cases can lead to heart enlargement and dysfunction. Prognosis: The prognosis depends on the underlying cause, extent of myocardial damage, and response to treatment. Viral myocarditis can resolve with supportive care, but severe cases may lead to heart failure or require a heart transplant. Chronic forms may lead to dilated cardiomyopathy .

Histopathological features of RHD: Aschoff bodies are focal areas of inflammation with infiltration of lymphocytes, plasma cells and activated macrophages or histiocytes. An endomyocardial biopsy showing Aschoff's bodies helps in confirming the diagnosis of RHD. Anitschkow cells or Caterpillar cells are activated macrophages with elongated and wavy nuclei commonly found within Aschoff bodies. Fibrinoid necrosis is seen in areas of the valves affected by inflammation. Note: Granulation tissue is seen in cases of repair. It comprises proliferating blood vessels, inflammatory cells and fibroblasts. Incorrect Options: Epithelioid granuloma (Option B) is typically seen in granulomatous conditions like tuberculosis or sarcoidosis . The clinical presentation given does not align with these conditions. Granulomatous vasculitis (Option C) refers to inflammation of blood vessels with granuloma formation, often seen in diseases like Wegener’s granulomatosis , but again, the clinical signs do not point to these disorders.

      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: B) Triphenyl tetrazolium chloride Explanation: Triphenyl tetrazolium chloride (TTC) is a stain commonly used in autopsies to identify myocardial infarction (MI). In myocardial infarction (MI), within the first 4 hours , gross examination may not show any visible infarcted area. However, immersion of tissue slices in TTC solution can highlight the necrotic area. This histochemical stain imparts a brick-red colour to intact, non-infarcted myocardium with preserved lactate dehydrogenase activity. Conversely, infarcted tissue appears as an unstained pale zone because of leakage of dehydrogenases through the damaged membranes of dead cells. Incorrect Options: Oil Red O (Option A) stain optimally detects lipids in frozen sections by staining them bright red and is commonly used to detect fat accumulation or atherosclerotic plaques, but it is not used for identifying infarcts in myocardial tissue. Sudan black B (Option C) is a lipid-specific stain primarily used to identify lipid-rich substances by staining them black , but it does not detect myocardial infarction. Masson's trichrome (Option D) stain is used to differentiate collagen fibres (stain blue) from other tissue components. It is not specific for visualising glycogen.

It is a liver enzyme that is primarily involved in the metabolism of glutathione , an antioxidant, and plays a role in detoxifying substances in the liver. Chronic alcohol consumption can induce liver stress and damage, leading to elevated GGT levels. While it is elevated in alcohol use, its elevation can also occur in several other conditions. Therefore, it is a non-specific marker of alcohol-induced liver damage. Alcoholic liver disease LFT AST/ SGOT (Option B ruled out) Non-specific ; ↑ (<300-400) This is a liver enzyme that rises in conditions causing liver damage, including alcohol-induced liver injury, but it is also elevated in a variety of non-liver conditions, like muscle injury or cardiac events.

      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: C) Multiple Myeloma Explanation: The clinical presentation of easy fatigability, back pain, and skull lytic lesions, along with Russell bodies in bone marrow biopsy, strongly suggests multiple myeloma, which commonly causes bone pain and elevated serum proteins. Multiple myeloma is a cancer of plasma cells, which normally produce antibodies to fight infections. In this disease, malignant plasma cells proliferate uncontrollably in the bone marrow, crowding out healthy blood cells and producing abnormal proteins that cause complications. Early symptoms may be absent, but when present, they include: Bone pain, especially in the spine or chest Nausea Constipation Loss of appetite Confusion or mental fogginess Fatigue Frequent infections Weight loss Weakness or numbness in the legs Excessive thirst CML (Chronic Myelogenous Leukemia) (Option A) is a blood and bone marrow cancer that leads to an overproduction of white blood cells. In its chronic phase, the disease can often go unnoticed until detected by a blood test. Symptoms include: Weakness Fatigue Shortness of breath with daily activities Fever Bone pain Unexplained weight loss Pain or fullness in the left side of the abdomen due to an enlarged spleen Night sweats CLL (Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia) (Option B) is a slow-progressing blood and bone marrow cancer, typically occurring in older adults. It may not cause symptoms in the early stages and is often discovered during a routine blood test. Later symptoms include: Painless swelling of lymph nodes Weakness or fatigue Feeling full due to spleen or liver enlargement Fever and frequent infections Easy bruising or bleeding Unexplained weight loss Drenching night sweats Hairy Cell Leukemia (Option D) is a cancer of the B lymphocytes (a type of white blood cell). The leukaemia cells in this condition look \"hairy\" under a microscope. Symptoms may be absent or include: A feeling of fullness in the abdomen, making it difficult to eat large meals Fatigue Easy bruising Frequent infections Weakness Unintentional weight loss",

      "explanation": "Correct Answer: C) ALL (Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia) Explanation: Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia (ALL) is the most common leukemia and cancer in children, often seen in patients with Down syndrome. It is a clonal malignancy where lymphoblasts, early lymphoid precursors, proliferate abnormally, replacing normal hematopoietic cells in the bone marrow. Bone marrow in ALL shows lymphoblasts with condensed nuclear chromatin, small nucleoli, and scant agranular cytoplasm, which are characteristic of lymphoblastic leukemia. Precursor B-cell ALL shows large purple malignant lymphoblasts on bone marrow aspirate smears. Normal lymphoblasts mature into B-cells or T-cells that fight infections, but in ALL, they fail to mature properly. T-cell ALL may present as a mediastinal mass, potentially causing superior vena cava (SVC) syndrome. Both peripheral blood and bone marrow in ALL show increased lymphoblasts. ALL has a poorer prognosis in adults compared to children. Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia (ALL) Lymphoblasts in bone marrow",

      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: C) Non-Hodgkin lymphoma Explanation: The case scenario of a 60-year-old man with scrotal swelling and ataxia is likely diagnosed as Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma (NHL) , where lymphatic obstruction causes scrotal swelling, and CNS involvement leads to ataxia. It is a type of cancer originating from lymphocytes and is characterized by the growth of lymphoid tissue. Clinical features: Asymptomatic Palpable Lymphadenopathy is the hallmark (neck, armpits, or groin). Lymphadenopathy is not rapidly progressive. B Symptoms (Fever, Night sweats, and Weight loss) Extranodal involvement Ileocecal region (abdominal pain or changes in bowel habits). Lymphomatoid polyposis. The oropharynx, especially Waldeyer's ring (sore throat or difficulty swallowing). Bone marrow involvement (cytopenias-anemia, leukopenia, and thrombocytopenia). Splenomegaly (abdominal discomfort and a sensation of fullness). Hodgkin lymphoma (Option B ruled out) Non-Hodgkin lymphoma (Option C) Age of presentation Bimodal distribution peaks in young adults (15-35 years) and older adults (over 55). More common in older adults but can occur at any age. Localization More often localised to a single axial group of nodes (cervical, mediastinal, para-aortic) More frequent involvement of multiple peripheral nodes Malignant cells Reed-Sternberg cells (owl eye cells) - B cells - induce inflammation and fibrosis Lymphoid cells - many subtypes - most are B cells than T cells Mass composition Inflammatory cells and fibrosis (reactive cells) Lymphoid cells Clinical Painless lymphadenopathy B symptoms Painless lymphadenopathy Mesenteric nodes and Waldeyer ring are involved. Spread Contiguous (touching); rarely extranodal Diffuse; often extranodal Staging Guides therapy Radiation mainstay treatment Limited importance Leukemic phase Doesn't occur Occurs Glioblastoma multiforme (Option A) is a type of brain tumour that arises from glial cells. It typically does not cause scrotal swelling or ataxia. The symptoms associated with glioblastoma multiforme are typically related to the location of the tumour within the brain. Non-seminomatous germ cell tumours (Option D) are a type of testicular cancer that arise from germ cells in the testicles. While they can cause scrotal swelling, ataxia is not a typical presentation of this type of tumour. Reference: Robbins & Cotran Pathologic Basis of Disease, 10th Edition, Page 611.",

Genetics: Trisomy 12, deletion 13q14, and others Origin: Post–germinal centre memory B cell or naive B Cells in the mantle zone of the lymph node (Option A) Etiopathogenesis Antiapoptotic protein BCL2 overexpression. CLL cell growth depends on Bruton Tyrosine kinase (BTK) activity. No association with radiation exposure Clinical Presentation Most common Leukemia in the elderly. Frequently asymptomatic at diagnosis. May present with fatigue, lymphadenopathy, hepatosplenomegaly, or infection due to immunosuppression. Associated with autoimmune hemolytic anaemia- Spherocytes can be seen on peripheral smear It can lead to hypogammaglobulinemia due to abnormal B cells, which impair normal antibody production. Infection is the M/C/C of death in CLL Laboratory diagnosis: Absolute lymphocyte count (ALC) > 5000/mm3 Bone marrow lymphocytes >30% Surface markers using flow cytometry were positive for CD5, CD23, CD19 CD20. CLL co-expresses both T cell ( CD5 ) and B cell ( CD20, CD19) markers Mature T cells (Option B) can give rise to several cancers, including Peripheral T-cell lymphoma (PTCL), Cutaneous T-cell lymphoma (CTCL), Adult T-cell leukaemia/lymphoma (ATLL) (associated with HTLV-1), Anaplastic large cell lymphoma (ALCL), and T-cell prolymphocytic leukaemia (T-PLL). Progenitor T cells (Option C) can give rise to cancers such as T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (T-ALL) and T-cell lymphoblastic lymphoma (T-LBL). Both of these are aggressive hematologic malignancies that involve the malignant transformation of immature T cells (or T-cell precursors), characterized by rapid proliferation of immature T lymphocytes. Granulocytes (Option D) can give rise to acute myelogenous leukaemia (AML), where immature myeloid cells, including granulocyte precursors, proliferate rapidly, and chronic myelogenous leukaemia (CML), characterized by uncontrolled production of mature granulocytes due to the Philadelphia chromosome. Both cancers stem from the malignant transformation of myeloid progenitor cells. Reference: Robbins & Cotran Pathologic Basis of Disease,10th Edition, Page 597-598.",

      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: B) Birbeck granules Explanation: A characteristic finding on electron microscopy in Langerhans cell histiocytosis (LCH) is the presence of Birbeck Granules . These are rod-shaped, tennis racket-like structures that have a central linear striation. They are considered to be specific ultrastructural markers for Langerhans cells. These are thought to be derived from the endosomal compartment and are composed of a protein called langerin (CD207), a unique marker for Langerhans cells and is involved in antigen presentation and immune response regulation. Histiocytes (Option A) are a type of immune cell that plays a key role in the body's defence mechanisms. They are specialized macrophages or dendritic cells found in tissues, where they function to engulf pathogens, dead cells, and foreign substances. Histiocytic disorders can give rise to cancers such as histiocytic sarcoma and Langerhans cell histiocytosis (LCH). Eosinophils (Option C) are a type of white blood cell involved in immune responses, particularly in allergic reactions and parasitic infections. They can give rise to cancers such as eosinophilic leukaemia and eosinophilic lymphoma, which are rare disorders characterized by the uncontrolled proliferation of eosinophils, leading to symptoms like organ infiltration, tissue damage, and inflammation. Giant cells (Option D) are large, multinucleated cells that can arise in response to chronic inflammation or certain infections. They can be found in various cancers, such as giant cell tumours of bone (a benign but locally aggressive tumour) and osteoclast-like giant cell tumours in soft tissues. Additionally, giant cells are often seen in granulomatous diseases like tuberculosis and sarcoidosis, where they form part of the immune response.",

      "explanation": "Correct Answer: A) Follicular lymphoma Explanation: Given the lymphadenopathy , the findings on lymph node biopsy (indented nuclei, BCL2 positivity), and the normal blood counts (no immature cells), Follicular lymphoma is the most likely diagnosis. Follicular lymphoma (FL) is a malignant neoplasm originating from germinal centre B-cells, characterised by the t(14;18) translocation leading to overexpression of BCL2. Clinically, it presents with painless lymphadenopathy and may include systemic symptoms. Histopathologically, FL exhibits a nodular growth pattern with centrocytes(Small cells with cleaved nuclei and scanty cytosol) and centroblasts(Larger cells with open nuclear chromatin and several nucleoli) Immunohistochemistry shows positivity for CD10/19/20, BCL2, and BCL6, and negativity for CD5. Management focuses on palliative approaches due to their indolent but incurable nature. Burkitt lymphoma (Option B) is a type of B-cell lymphoma characterised by rapidly growing tumours , typically extranodal , most commonly in the abdomen or jaw . It often presents as large masses rather than just cervical lymphadenopathy .

      "explanation": "Correct Answer: A) Anti-CTLA-4 Ab is a new modality in the treatment of advanced cancers cancers. It works by blocking the CTLA-4 receptor , enhancing T-cell activation and immune response against tumour cells. Immune surveillance: Immune surveillance refers to the immune system’s ability to detect and eliminate cancerous cells, thereby preventing cancer development and progression. CTLA-4 (cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated protein 4) is a checkpoint protein that negatively regulates T-cell activation. Immunotherapeutic agents, such as ipilimumab , target CTLA-4 to enhance T-cell activation, boosting the immune response against tumours and showing promising results in treating advanced cancers. Mutations in tumour suppressor genes typically increase tumorigenicity and antigenicity (Option B) , not decrease antigen toxicity. PD1/PDL1 activation generally inhibits immune responses (Option C) , leading to immune evasion by tumours, not suppression. Binding of CD28 to CD80/86 enhances immune activation, not tolerance (Option D) . Immune tolerance is more associated with inhibitory signals like CTLA-4.

      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: A) PML-RARA Explanation: All-trans retinoic acid (ATRA) is specifically used in the treatment of acute promyelocytic leukaemia (APL) , which is associated with the genetic fusion of PML (promyelocytic leukaemia gene) and RARA (retinoic acid receptor alpha) genes. The fusion disrupts the normal differentiation of promyelocytes, and ATRA helps reverse this block by promoting differentiation. M3 AML/ Acute promyelocytic leukaemia: Genetics : t(15:17) translocation causes PML-RARA (retinoic acid receptor alpha) fusion protein formation. Blocks promyelocyte → myelocyte maturation. Diagnosis of choice: FISH Smear findings: Increased promyelocytes. Auer Rods : Fused granules in promyelocytes Faggot Cells: Auer rods with a crisscross pattern. Laboratory : Low haemoglobin and platelets. > 20% blasts on peripheral and bone marrow smear Stain: PAS + CD markers: CD 13, 33 + Complication : Disseminated intravascular coagulation therefore, chemotherapy is not recommended. Treatment : ATRA (All-trans-retinoic-acid) + As 2 O 3 (arsenic trioxide) Best prognosis among all AML. BCR-ABL (Option B) fusion gene is characteristic of chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) . The treatment for CML typically involves tyrosine kinase inhibitors (e.g., imatinib) rather than ATRA. cMYC (Option C) is an oncogene often implicated in Burkitt lymphoma and other cancers, but it is not treated with ATRA. Treatment for cMYC-related tumours typically involves chemotherapy and targeted therapy based on the specific malignancy. RUNX1-ETO (Option D) fusion gene is associated with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) , but it does not respond to ATRA treatment. Treatment for AML often includes chemotherapy and other agents.

It is less commonly associated with hepatosplenomegaly and sternal tenderness. Chronic Lymphoblastic Leukemia (CLL) (Option B) usually occurs in older individuals and is characterised by lymphocytosis, lymphadenopathy, and splenomegaly. It is less likely to present with hepatomegaly, sternal tenderness, and petechiae in a 10-year-old patient.

      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: C) Primary myelofibrosis Explanation: Primary myelofibrosis (PMF) is a chronic myeloproliferative neoplasm characterised by the development of extensive marrow fibrosis , which impairs normal hematopoiesis. This fibrosis is driven by the inappropriate release of fibrogenic factors, such as platelet-derived growth factor and TGF- β , from neoplastic megakaryocytes. Clinically, PMF presents with progressive anaemia, splenomegaly, and symptoms like fatigue and weight loss. WHO diagnostic criteria: Major criteria: Megakaryocyte proliferation and atypia, usually with reticulin or collagen fibrosis. Not meeting WHO criteria for BCR-ABL1 + CML, PV, ET, MDS, or other myeloid neoplasm. Presence of JAK2, CALR, or MPL mutation or in the absence of these mutations, presence of other clonal markers, or absence of minor reactive BM reticulin fibrosis. Minor criteria: Leukocytosis ≥ 11 × 10 9 /L. Increased Serum Lactate Dehydrogenase (LDH). Anaemia is not attributed to another condition. Palpable Splenomegaly. Polycythemia vera (Option A) : Given that the patient presents with anaemia, the diagnosis is unlikely to be polycythemia vera. Essential thrombocythemia (Option B): In Essential thrombocythemia, patients usually present erythromelalgia and elevated platelet count, and there is an absence of marrow fibrosis. Chronic myeloid leukaemia (Option D): Though CML presents with anaemia and splenomegaly, bone marrow aspirate in CML is likely to show dwarf megakaryocyte and characteristic garden party appearance.",

AML arises due to genetic mutations in hematopoietic stem cells, leading to the accumulation of immature myeloblasts in the bone marrow, resulting in marrow failure. Patients often present with pancytopenia-related symptoms, including easy bruising (due to thrombocytopenia), fatigue (due to anaemia), and infections (due to leukopenia with dysfunctional blasts). Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia (Option B): In ALL, the lymphoblasts are CD33-ve and myeloperoxidase-ve. Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia (Option C) : Smudge cells characteristic of CLL are CD33-ve, CD20+ve, and CD5+ve. Myelodysplastic Syndrome (Option D) is a heterogeneous group of hematologic neoplasms classically described as a clonal disorder of hematopoietic stem cells leading to dysplasia and ineffective hematopoiesis in the bone marrow.

It accurately detects and quantifies the BCR-ABL1 fusion gene, allowing for precise assessment of treatment response and minimal residual disease (MRD) status in CML patients. Regular monitoring with RT-PCR guides treatment decisions for optimal patient outcomes. Chronic Myeloid Leukemia: It occurs due to the translocation of Philadelphia chromosome t (9:22) (q34.1, q11.2). BCR-ALB1 is a hybrid gene. It is a translocation with respect to the long arm of chromosome no. 9 to the long arm of chromosome no. 22 BCR : Breakpoint cluster region ALB1 : Abelson leukemia BCR-ALB1 results in the production of novel oncoproteins (Molecular weight: 210 kilodaltons) CBC (Complete Blood Count) (Option A): While CBC indicates changes in blood cell levels, it may not detect MRD or early treatment failure as sensitively as RT-PCR. Cytogenetic Test (Option B): Although cytogenetic tests reveal chromosomal abnormalities like the Philadelphia chromosome, they may not detect low levels of disease or MRD as effectively as molecular techniques like RT-PCR.

      "explanation": "Correct Answer: A) Presence of Bence-Jones proteinuria Explanation: The scenario describing lower back pain with a 1-1.5 mm osteolytic lesion at the T10 vertebra and a histopathological image showing intracytoplasmic inclusions (Russell bodies) suggests Multiple Myeloma , which is characterised by the presence of Bence-Jones proteinuria. It is caused by increased antibody production. It is a plasma cell neoplasm associated with (Mnemonic: CRAB features with immune abnormalities) C - Hyper c alcemia (Option D ruled out) R - R enal failure A - A naemia B - Lytic b one lesions, and Immune abnormalities. The cells produce excess free light chains, either alongside complete immunoglobulins or independently. (Option C ruled out) Due to their small size, free light chains ( Bence Jones proteins ) can pass through the glomeruli of the kidneys and appear in the urine. This is a diagnostic marker for multiple myeloma. Inclusion Bodies Seen In Multiple Myeloma Russel bodies: Location: Intracytoplasmic Composition: Eosinophilic Round Dilated endoplasmic reticulum cisternae filled with condensed immunoglobulin. . Dutcher bodies Location: Intranuclear. Composition: Globular inclusions containing accumulated immunoglobulin. Plasma Cell Variants In Multiple Myeloma Mott cells Contain Grape-like cytoplasmic droplets. Composition: Inclusion bodies, fibrils, crystalline rods, and globules. Flame cells Appearance : Fiery red cytoplasm. Cause : High concentration of immunoglobulin as bright red granules within the cytoplasm. Often seen in IgA subtype myeloma. Rouleaux formation High levels of M protein in the blood cause red cells to stick to one another in linear arrays in smears, a finding referred to as rouleaux formation. (Option B ruled out) It is also seen in s lupus erythematosus and early HIV infection.",

      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: A) Hepatitis C infection Explanation: Hepatitis C infection is associated with Cryoglobulinemia . Cryoglobulinemia : Cryoglobulins are proteins that precipitate from serum or plasma at low temperatures (<37°C). They can be a mixture of immunoglobulin and complement components or immunoglobulins alone. They deposit in medium and large-sized blood vessels throughout the body, causing endothelial injury and end-organ damage known as cryoglobulinemia. It is often associated with Hepatitis C virus infection Hepatitis B virus infection HIV Autoimmune diseases ( mainly SLE and Sjogren’s syndrome) Lymphoproliferative disorders. Ovarian cancer (Option B) is a type of cancer that begins in the ovaries (female reproductive organs). It often goes undiagnosed in the early stages due to vague symptoms like abdominal bloating, pelvic pain, and early satiety. Risk factors include age, family history, and genetic mutations (such as BRCA1 and BRCA2). Diabetes (Option C) is a chronic condition where the body can't properly regulate blood sugar. Type 1 is insulin deficiency due to an autoimmune response, while Type 2 is caused by insulin resistance, often linked to obesity. Symptoms include thirst, frequent urination, and fatigue. Treatment involves lifestyle changes and medication, with long-term risks to organs like the heart and kidneys. Leukaemia (Option D) is a type of cancer that affects the blood and bone marrow, leading to the abnormal production of white blood cells. It is classified into acute and chronic forms, with acute leukaemia progressing rapidly and chronic leukaemia developing more slowly. Symptoms include fatigue, fever, frequent infections, easy bruising, and weight loss. Reference: Robbins & Cotran Pathological Basis of Diseases, 10th Edition, Page 837.",

      "explanation": "Correct Answer: A) Hairy cell Explanation: The given image depicts a Hairy cell, which is characterised by the presence of fine, hair-like projections on the surface of the cell. It is a characteristic type of cell found in Hairy Cell Leukemia, which involves abnormal proliferation of Mature B cells. These cells have a round, oblong, or reniform nucleus and pale blue cytoplasm. Gaucher cells (Option B) are lipid-laden macrophages found in Gaucher's disease , an autosomal recessive disorder caused by mutations in the GBA1 gene, resulting in deficient glucocerebrosidase enzyme activity. These cells appear as foamy macrophages with a crumpled tissue-paper appearance due to the accumulation of glucocerebroside in the cytoplasm. Crinkled paper macrophages in the marrow space Sickle cells (Option C) are abnormally shaped red blood cells that resemble a crescent or sickle due to the presence of abnormal haemoglobin (haemoglobin S) . These cells are not characterized by cytoplasmic projections like hairy cells. Target cells (Option D) are red blood cells that have a bull's-eye appearance due to an increase in cell membrane relative to the volume of the cytoplasm. This condition can occur in several disorders, such as thalassemia , but they do not have the cytoplasmic projections seen in hairy cells.",

      "explanation": "white blood cell that produces antibodies. It is characterized by the presence of abnormal plasma cells in the bone marrow, which can lead to bone destruction and the release of monoclonal (abnormal) immunoglobulins or light chains into the bloodstream. The clinical presentation of low back ache, progressive pallor (anemia), deranged kidney function tests (KFT), disproportionately increased gamma globulin levels, and lytic lesions on X-ray spine are all consistent with multiple myeloma. Incorrect Options: Option B - MGUS (Monoclonal Gammopathy of Undetermined Significance): MGUS is a benign condition where a small amount of abnormal plasma cells produce a monoclonal protein (usually immunoglobulin) in the blood. It is generally asymptomatic and does not cause significant organ damage. The patient in the scenario has more severe symptoms and findings that are not typical for MGUS. Option C - Immunoglobulin Light Chain Amyloidosis (AL) : AL amyloidosis is a rare condition where abnormal light chain proteins are deposited as amyloid in various organs, including the kidneys. This can lead to organ dysfunction. While AL amyloidosis can cause kidney involvement and abnormal levels of light chains, the lytic bone lesions seen on X-ray and the disproportionately increased gamma globulin levels are not characteristic of AL amyloidosis. Option D - Solitary Plasmacytoma: Solitary plasmacytoma is a localized tumor of plasma cells that typically presents as a single mass in bone or soft tissue. It is less likely in this case because the patient has multiple lytic lesions on X-ray spine, which indicates widespread bone involvement. Solitary plasmacytoma typically doesn't show this pattern of multiple bone lesions. Reference: .",

Flow cytometry is a highly sensitive technique used to identify the specific cell surface markers on the abnormal lymphocytes in CLL. It helps distinguish CLL from other types of lymphoma and leukaemia. Flow cytometry markers of CLL include CD 5+, CD10-, CD19+, CD20+, CD 23+ and CD 200+ Cytogenic studies (Option A), including Fluorescence In Situ Hybridization ( FISH) , are helpful in identifying specific genetic mutations associated with CLL, which have prognostic implications. However, flow cytometry is a more immediate and critical step for diagnosis, as it directly assesses the immunophenotype of the cells. Bone marrow biopsy (Option B) might be performed later to evaluate marrow involvement or disease progression , but it is not the first-line investigation for CLL. Given the peripheral smear findings, Flow cytometry helps to assess the immunophenotype of the lymphocytes. X-ray crystallography (Option D) is a technique used to determine the atomic and molecular structure of crystals. It is irrelevant in the context of diagnosing CLL.

      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: A) Von Willebrand disease Explanation: Von Willebrand disease (VWD) is the most common inherited bleeding disorder caused by defective or deficient von Willebrand factor (vWF) . It follows an autosomal dominant inheritance pattern , affecting both males and females, with a 50% chance of passing the disorder to offspring. Von Willebrand disease is clinically and molecularly heterogeneous, with three identified types, each exhibiting a variety of phenotypes. vWD type 1 vWD Type 2 vWD Type 3 Autosomal dominant. The most common type. Mild to moderate vWF deficiency. Quantitative defect. Point substitutions prevent the vWF protein from maturing or cause it to leave the plasma quickly. Autosomal dominant. Qualitative defect. Types: 2A, 2B, 2M, 2N 2A ( Most common ) - Decrease in binding between vWF and Gp1b/9 Missense mutations cause faulty multimer formation → the most active forms of vWF, i.e. large- and intermediate-sized multimers are absent. 2B - Increase in binding between vWF and Gp1b/9 2M - VWF-dependent platelet adhesion is decreased. VWF binding to platelets is impaired. Type 2M VWD typically has mild to moderate mucocutaneous bleeding 2N - There is a marked decline in the binding affinity for factor VIII. The level of factor VIII is lower when compared to the VWF: Ag. This led to misdiagnosis as haemophilia A. Autosomal recessive . Quantitative defect. Produced by frameshift mutations or deletions affecting both alleles (autosomal recessive), which produce little or no vWF. Factor VIII levels are also lowered because vWF stabilizes factor VIII in the blood, and the resulting bleeding condition is severe. Hemophilia A (Option B) is an X-linked recessive disorder that mainly affects males, with females being carriers. This makes it an unlikely diagnosis for this patient, who has a family history involving females. Christmas disease (Option C) is an X-linked recessive disorder; hence, this condition is primarily seen in males, and it is less likely to be the cause of an autosomal dominant inheritance pattern. Factor X deficiency (Option D) is a rare bleeding disorder that can be inherited in autosomal recessive patterns, which causes the clotting process to take longer than normal.

      "explanation": "Correct Answer: C) Factor XII Explanation: Factor XII deficiency (Hageman factor) does not significantly affect clotting in vivo, as it primarily participates in the intrinsic pathway and is involved in the activation of the fibrinolytic system and the contact activation of the clotting cascade. Factor XII does not notably impair normal clotting, as other factors and pathways can compensate for its lack. In contrast, Factor VII, Factor V, and Factor IX deficiencies significantly impact the clotting cascade and lead to bleeding disorders. Factor VII (Option A) is a critical component of the extrinsic pathway of coagulation. Deficiency can lead to bleeding disorders, as it directly impacts the initiation of the clotting cascade in vivo. Factor V (Option B) is essential for the common pathway of coagulation, acting as a cofactor for Factor Xa in the conversion of prothrombin to thrombin. Its deficiency results in impaired clotting and increases the risk of bleeding. Factor IX (Option D) is involved in the intrinsic pathway of coagulation. Deficiency causes Hemophilia B, leading to impaired clot formation and increased bleeding risk in vivo. Reference: Robbins & Cotran Pathologic Basis of Disease, 10th Edition, Page 121",

When tissue factor is exposed due to endothelial injury, it forms a complex with Factor VII. This complex activates Factor IX by cleaving it to Factor IXa, which then participates in the coagulation cascade. Factor XII (Hageman factor) (Option A) is involved in the initiation of the intrinsic pathway of the coagulation cascade. It is not directly responsible for activating factor IX in response to closed endothelial injury. Factor VIII (antihemophilic factor A) (Option C) plays a crucial role in the intrinsic pathway of the coagulation cascade.

      "explanation": "Correct Answer: A) V Explanation: The Leiden mutation is a genetic alteration in Factor V , a protein essential for blood clotting. It has the autosomal dominant type of inheritance. The mutation makes factor V resistant to inactivation by protein C, disrupting an antithrombotic pathway and increasing the risk of thrombosis. Factor VIII (Option B) plays a key role in the intrinsic pathway of coagulation, where it activates Factor X to Xa, which then helps in the conversion of prothrombin to thrombin, leading to the formation of a blood clot. It is not associated with the Leiden mutation. Factor I (Option C) , also known as fibrinogen, is the precursor to fibrin, which forms the structural framework of a blood clot. When bleeding occurs, fibrinogen is converted to fibrin by the enzyme thrombin during the final steps of the coagulation cascade. It is not associated with the Leiden mutation. Factor X (Option D) , also known as the Stuart-Prower factor, is a key enzyme in the blood clotting process. It is activated to Factor Xa and plays a crucial role in converting prothrombin to thrombin, ultimately leading to the formation of a blood clot. It is not associated with the Leiden mutation.

      },
      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "amplitude (MA) on TEG reflects the strength of the clot, which is primarily determined by the number and function of platelets and the fibrinogen concentration. The platelets contribute most significantly to the clot's strength and the MA value. Thromboelastography (TEG) is a diagnostic tool used to evaluate coagulation profiles and guide management with transfusions and hemostatic therapies. Studies show that TEG can reduce blood product usage by up to 40%, decrease postoperative length of stay, and lower the risk of reoperation. TEG measures the viscoelastic properties of blood as clotting occurs. The resulting data is plotted on a graph with time on the x-axis and amplitude (clot strength) on the y-axis. Key values include: Reaction time (R): The time it takes for the clot strength to reach an amplitude of 2 mm. Kinetics (K): The time from R to when the amplitude reaches 20 mm. α -angle: The angle formed by a line from R to the point where K intersects with the 20 mm amplitude mark. Maximum amplitude (MA): The highest amplitude reached. Lysis at 30 minutes (Ly30): The per cent decrease in amplitude 30 minutes after MA (or 60 minutes in some cases). Inference: A prolonged R time may indicate coagulation factor deficiency or anticoagulation. A decreased α -angle can result from hypofibrinogenemia Low MA can be due to thrombocytopenia or platelet dysfunction. Increased Ly30 indicates hyperfibrinolysis, often seen in severe trauma or with thrombolytic therapy. Based on the TEG findings, targeted blood products can be administered to normalize coagulation. For example: Fresh frozen plasma for prolonged R time Cryoprecipitate for decreased α -angle Platelets for decreased MA Tranexamic acid or aminocaproic acid for increased Ly30.",

      },
      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "ADAMTS protease activity Correct Answer: C) TPE removes Anti ADAMTS13 autoantibodies and thereby increases the ADAMTS protease activity Explanation: Total plasma exchange (TPE) is a key treatment for thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP); it removes the autoantibodies against ADAMTS13. (Option B ruled out) ADAMTS13 is a protease that cleaves von Willebrand factor, preventing the formation of large, thrombogenic von Willebrand factor multimers. (Option A ruled out) This helps restore normal ADAMTS13 activity and reduces the microvascular clotting that characterizes TTP. Treatment of TTP Plasma exchange (PEX) with high-dose corticosteroid therapy. It is the mainstay of treatment in TTP. Corticosteroids operate by decreasing the activity of the reticuloendothelial system as well as decreasing autoantibody production. Both the ultra-large VWF multimers and the ADAMTS13 autoantibodies are effectively removed from circulation by plasma exchange therapy. The recommended volume of exchange is one estimated plasma volume (usually 40 mL/kg of body weight) with each treatment. The recommended dose for corticosteroids is 1 mg/kg per day of prednisolone. Rituximab An anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody was found to help treat TTP refractory to PEX. It targets B-lymphocytes and has a good response rate in refractory and relapsed TTP. Caplacizumab It has a high potential for TTP. It is a humanized monoclonal antibody fragment (a bivalent, variable-domain-only fragment) that attacks the A1 section of VWF and prevents platelet adhesion. Others Splenectomy, Vincristine, Cyclosporine and Cyclophosphamide. TPE replenishes the coagulation factor (Option D) : TPE does not replenish coagulation factors; instead, it removes harmful substances like autoantibodies against ADAMTS13 in TTP, where clotting issues stem from defective vWF cleavage, not coagulation factor deficiencies.

        "D": "Bleeding time"
      },
      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: C) Thromboelastography Explanation: Thromboelastography (TEG) is a coagulation test that evaluates the entire coagulation pathway, including both the intrinsic and extrinsic pathways and fibrinolysis. It offers a comprehensive assessment of clot formation, clot strength, and clot breakdown. Thromboelastography (TEG) is a diagnostic tool used to evaluate coagulation profiles and guide management with transfusions and hemostatic therapies. Studies show that TEG can reduce blood product usage by up to 40%, decrease postoperative length of stay, and lower the risk of reoperation. TEG measures the viscoelastic properties of blood as clotting occurs. The resulting data is plotted on a graph with time on the x-axis and amplitude (clot strength) on the y-axis. Key values include: Reaction time (R): The time it takes for the clot strength to reach an amplitude of 2 mm. Kinetics (K): The time from R to when the amplitude reaches 20 mm. α -angle: The angle formed by a line from R to the point where K intersects with the 20 mm amplitude mark. Maximum amplitude (MA): The highest amplitude reached. Lysis at 30 minutes (Ly30): The per cent decrease in amplitude 30 minutes after MA (or 60 minutes in some cases). Inference: A prolonged R time may indicate coagulation factor deficiency or anticoagulation. A decreased α -angle can result from hypofibrinogenemia Low MA can be due to thrombocytopenia or platelet dysfunction. Increased Ly30 indicates hyperfibrinolysis, often seen in severe trauma or with thrombolytic therapy. Based on the TEG findings, targeted blood products can be administered to normalize coagulation. For example: Fresh frozen plasma for prolonged R time Cryoprecipitate for decreased α -angle Platelets for decreased MA Tranexamic acid or aminocaproic acid for increased Ly30 Incorrect Options: Activated Partial Thromboplastin Time (aPTT) (Option A) primarily evaluates the intrinsic pathway of the coagulation cascade. Prothrombin Time (PT) (Option B) mainly assesses the extrinsic pathway of the coagulation cascade. Bleeding Time (Option D) measures the duration for bleeding to cease following a standardized skin incision. It primarily evaluates platelet function and primary hemostasis.",
