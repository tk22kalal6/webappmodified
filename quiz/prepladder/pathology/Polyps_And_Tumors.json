      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: C) Hyperplasia of parietal cells within the stomach Explanation: The characteristic features described in the scenario, including recurrent abdominal pain, heartburn, multiple duodenal ulcers, and elevated serum gastrin levels, strongly suggest a diagnosis of Zollinger-Ellison syndrome. A hallmark feature of Zollinger-Ellison syndrome is marked hyperplasia of parietal cells within the stomach, leading to increased oxyntic mucosal thickness induced by excessive gastrin secretion from gastrinomas. Presence of gastrin-secreting tumors in the stomach (Option A): Zollinger-Ellison syndrome (ZES) is characterized by gastrin-secreting neuroendocrine tumors called gastrinomas. However, these tumors are predominantly found in the small intestine or pancreas rather than the stomach. The most common extrapancreatic site of gastrinoma is the duodenum. Presence of erosive esophagitis and hiatal hernia (Option B): These features are commonly associated with gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), not Zollinger-Ellison syndrome. ZES primarily presents with duodenal ulcers or chronic diarrhea due to excessive gastric acid secretion from gastrinomas. Association with MEN2 gene mutation (Option D): Gastrinomas are sporadic in 75% of cases. Approximately 25% of patients with gastrinomas have MEN1 (not MEN2), which is linked to aggressive tumor behaviour and primarily presents with duodenal tumors.

      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: B) DOG1 Explanation: DOG1 (Discovered On GIST-1) is a highly sensitive and specific marker for GISTs (Gastrointestinal Stromal Tumor), especially in C-kit-negative cases. CD34 (Option A): CD34 is a cell surface marker often expressed in GISTs. However, CD34 positivity alone cannot confirm GIST diagnosis, especially when C-kit mutation testing is negative. It aids in diagnosis, particularly when used alongside markers like DOG1. S-100(Option C): S100 is a marker commonly associated with neural and melanocytic tumors, not typically expressed in GISTs. CD117(Option D): CD117 (C-kit) expression is a hallmark of GISTs and is used as a most common diagnostic marker, but it does not confirm the diagnosis in the absence of C-kit mutations.

      },
      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: A) KIT mutation Explanation: KIT (c-kit) is a proto-oncogene encoding a receptor tyrosine kinase. Mutations in KIT are the most common genetic abnormalities in GISTs, occurring in about 70-80% of cases. These mutations result in constant activation of KIT signaling, driving tumor growth and survival. PDGFRA mutation (Platelet-Derived Growth Factor Receptor Alpha) ( Option B): PDGFRA is a proto-oncogene that encodes a receptor tyrosine kinase. Mutations in PDGFRA occur in approximately 5-10% of GISTs and, similar to KIT mutations, drive tumor growth and progression by activating downstream signaling pathways. SDH mutation (Succinate Dehydrogenase) (Option C): SDH is a mitochondrial enzyme complex essential for cellular energy production. Mutations in genes encoding SDH subunits (SDHA, SDHB, SDHC, SDHD) are observed in SDH-deficient GISTs, which are also called KIT/PDGFRA wild-types as they lack KIT and PDGFRA mutations. These types of GIST are seen in cases with Carney-Stratakis syndrome (GIST + paraganglioma) or the Carney triad (GIST + paraganglioma + pulmonary chondroma).

Paneth cells (Option C): Paneth cells, located in the small intestine's crypts of Lieberk√ºhn, particularly in the ileum, secrete antimicrobial peptides like defensins and lysozyme to defend against bacterial infections. G cells (Option D): G cells are endocrine cells in the gastric antrum that produce gastrin, a hormone that stimulates gastric acid secretion. Dysfunctions in G cells can result in conditions like gastrinomas, seen in Zollinger-Ellison syndrome, which involves excessive gastric acid production and peptic ulcers.

        "D": "Crohn's disease"
      },
      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: A) Carcinoid tumor Explanation: Based on the patient's presentation and histological findings, the most likely diagnosis is a Carcinoid tumor that originates from scattered neuroendocrine cells in the GIT. They present with symptoms like flushing, bronchospasm, abdominal pain, diarrhea, and occasionally weight loss due to the secretion of vasoactive substances like serotonin, leading to carcinoid syndrome. Upper GI endoscopy may reveal yellow-tan intramural or submucosal masses. Histological examination often reveals cohesive cells with scant granular cytoplasm and stains positive for neuroendocrine markers like chromogranin A, synaptophysin, and leucine-7. Gastric outlet obstruction (Option B): Gastric outlet obstruction can be caused by conditions like gastric cancer or peptic ulcer disease in adults and infantile hypertrophic pyloric stenosis in children. The obstruction leads to decreased HCl secretion, resulting in metabolic alkalosis. Paradoxical aciduria may be a compensatory mechanism through the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS). Hypertrophic pyloric stenosis (Option C): Hypertrophic pyloric stenosis is a congenital condition characterized by hypertrophy and hyperplasia of the pyloric muscle, leading to gastric outlet obstruction in infants. It presents with non-bilious projectile vomiting, an olive-shaped lump palpable in the abdomen, and failure to thrive. Crohn's disease (Option D): Crohn's disease is a chronic granulomatous inflammation that affects the entire gastrointestinal tract, characterized by non-caseating granulomas with epithelioid histiocytes, lymphocytes, and multinucleated giant cells. It also shows intramural masses or strictures with patchy inflammation and \"skip lesions\" observed on endoscopy.

Mutations in the CDH1 gene (E-cadherin), associated with hereditary diffuse gastric cancer (HDGC), can lead to an increased risk of diffuse-type gastric cancer but not related to the intestinal type of gastric cancer. Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) infection (Option A): H. pylori infection is highly associated with intestinal-type gastric cancer as this bacterium causes chronic inflammation and atrophic gastritis, leading to intestinal metaplasia. APC gene mutation(Option B): The APC gene mutation is primarily associated with familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP) and colorectal cancer. In intestinal-type gastric cancer, APC mutations may contribute to dysregulated Wnt signaling pathways, leading to aberrant cell growth and adenoma-carcinoma progression. High intake of smoked or pickled foods (Option D): Diets high in smoked or pickled foods are specifically associated with an increased risk of intestinal-type gastric cancer due to exposure to nitrosamines and other carcinogens present in these food preparations.

      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: C) Modified Giemsa stain Explanation: The given clinical presentation suggests peptic ulcer disease (PUD), and the organism involved in this condition is Helicobacter pylori. Due to its high sensitivity and specificity, the Modified Giemsa stain is widely regarded as the gold standard for H. pylori detection. It selectively targets H. pylori bacteria, staining them pink to red against a blue or purple background. Warthin Starry silver stain (Option A): The Warthin-Starry silver stain is a specialised technique for visualising bacteria like Helicobacter pylori and Spirochetes. However, it is less commonly used than the Modified Giemsa stain for H. pylori due to its more complex procedure and lower sensitivity. Wright stain (Option B): The Wright stain is primarily used for staining blood cells and is not routinely employed for identifying H. pylori. Gram stain (Option D): The Gram stain is used to classify bacteria into Gram-positive and Gram-negative groups based on cell wall characteristics, but it is ineffective for visualising H. pylori.",

      "correct_answer": "D",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: D) Pepsin Explanation: Pepsin is not considered a protective factor for peptic ulcer disease (PUD). Excessive pepsin activity, especially in the presence of acid, can lead to tissue damage and ulcer formation. Therefore, pepsin is considered a contributing factor to ulceration rather than a protective factor against PUD.

      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer:B) Cushing ulcer Explanation: In the given scenario, the patient's acute onset hematemesis following a traumatic brain injury and neurosurgical intervention suggests the likely development of a stress-related ulcer, particularly a Cushing ulcer. Feature Cushing's Ulcers (Option B) Curling Ulcers (Option A) Location Usually found in the stomach (cardia), oesophagus, or duodenum Typically occur in the proximal duodenum Associated condition Elevated intracranial pressure (e.g., head trauma, intracranial haemorrhage) Severe burns (involving >30% of body surface area) or trauma Pathogenesis Increased vagal activity stimulates gastric acid secretion, leading to ulcer formation. Result from decreased mucosal blood flow due to systemic hypotension or stress-induced vasoconstriction Ulcer characteristics Deep ulcers; increased risk of perforation. Superficial ulcers. Option C) Gastric antral vascular ectasia (GAVE): GAVE presents as longitudinal stripes of edematous, erythematous mucosa alternating with paler mucosa, resembling a \"watermelon stomach\". It is a cause of non-stress-related upper GI bleeding, often associated with cirrhosis and systemic sclerosis. Option D) Dieulafoy lesions Dieulafoy lesions are abnormal submucous arterioles often found near the gastroesophageal junction in the stomach's lesser curvature, which can cause recurrent, sometimes severe, gastric bleeding. NSAID use can increase the bleeding risk, and it is a non-stress-related cause of GI bleeding. Reference: Robbins and Cotran Pathologic Basis of Disease, 10th Edition, Page 766",
