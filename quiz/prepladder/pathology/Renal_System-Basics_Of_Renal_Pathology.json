      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Bowman's capsule. Correct answer: B) The GBM is a selective barrier between the glomerular capillaries and Bowman's capsule. Explanation: Option B accurately describes the function of the GBM, which acts as a semipermeable barrier, allowing small molecules to pass while restricting the passage of larger molecules, such as proteins, thereby facilitating urine formation. GBM primarily comprises collagen type IV, laminins, proteoglycans, and other glycoproteins.(Option A) Thickening of the GBM is associated with conditions such as diabetic nephropathy and membranous nephropathy, but not minimal change disease, which typically shows normal or minimal changes in the GBM under light microscopy.(Option C) GBM is permeable to small molecules but is a selective barrier to larger molecules such as albumin.

      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "CORRECT ANSWER : C)Infection with urease-producing bacteria EXPLANATION: Triple phosphate stones, also known as struvite stones, are composed of magnesium ammonium phosphate. They typically form in alkaline urine due to urinary tract infections caused by urease-producing bacteria. These bacteria hydrolyse urea into ammonia, increasing urine pH and facilitating stone formation. Struvite stones are characterised by their \"coffin lid\" appearance under a microscope. They can grow rapidly and fill the renal pelvis, leading to complications like infection and obstruction. Reference: Robbins and Cotran Pathologic Basis of Disease, 10th edition, page 947",

Muddy brown casts will be seen in this condition. Muddy brown casts: They are often seen in patients with ethylene glycol poisoning, leading to acute tubular necrosis (ATN). Ethylene glycol metabolites can damage renal tubules, resulting in the formation of muddy brown casts in urine sediment. . The dark brown colouration is due to haemoglobin breakdown products and other cellular components. Reference: Robbins and Cotran Pathologic Basis of Disease, 10th edition, page 947",

      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Correct answer : C)It often presents with recurrent urinary tract infections. Explanation: Medullary Sponge Kidney (MSK) often presents with recurrent urinary tract infections is incorrect because recurrent UTIs are not a defining feature of the condition . While patients with MSK may experience urinary tract infections, it is not a characteristic or common presentation of the disease. It is usually asymptomatic. Medullary Sponge Kidney: The term medullary sponge kidney is restricted to multiple cystic dilations of the collecting ducts in the medulla. The condition occurs in adults and is usually discovered radiographically. (Option A) . Renal function is usually normal. On gross inspection, the papillary ducts in the medulla are dilated (Option B) and small cysts may be present. The cysts are lined by cuboidal epithelium or occasionally by transitional epithelium. (Option D). Unless there is superimposed pyelonephritis, cortical scarring is absent. The pathogenesis is unknown. Reference: Robbins and Cotran Pathologic Basis of Disease, 10th edition, page: 944",
