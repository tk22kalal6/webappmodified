      "question": "A 28-year-old woman with a known history of beta-thalassemia undergoes a blood transfusion. During the transfusion, she develops symptoms of anxiety, hypotension, and fever. What is the next appropriate step in the management of this patient?",
      "options": {
        "A": "Stop the blood transfusion and restart after stabilization",
        "B": "Continue the blood transfusion and perform an ECG",
        "C": "Investigate for clerical errors in the blood transfusion process",
        "D": "Administer corticosteroids and monitor vital signs"
      },
      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: A) Stop the blood transfusion and restart after stabilization Explanation: In a woman with beta-thalassemia experiencing anxiety, hypotension, and fever during transfusion, the immediate step is to stop the transfusion and ensure stabilization. Transfusion Reactions: It refers to an adverse response to blood components, which can be Immunologically mediated (via WBC) Related to infections. It can either be immediate or delayed. Aspect Immediate Transfusion Reactions Delayed Transfusion Reactions Onset Time Within hours of transfusion Days to weeks after transfusion Cause Immunologic reactions, hemolytic or non-hemolytic Immune-mediated, often involving minor antigen sensitization Presentation Fever, chills, Dyspnea (TRALI, TACO), Acute respiratory distress (TRALI), Pulmonary oedema (TACO), hypothermia, electrolyte abnormalities, coagulopathy, acid-base disorders and hyperkalemia Fever, jaundice, Gradual decline in haemoglobin levels (hemolysis) Severity Can range from mild to life-threatening Generally less severe than immediate reactions Examples Febrile non-hemolytic reaction (FNHTR) Transfusion-related acute lung injury (TRALI) Transfusion-associated circulatory overload (TACO) Delayed hemolytic reaction Management Stop the blood transfusion. Supportive care. Three samples are to be collected Blood 1st sample: For BG/CM (blood grouping - cross matching) (EDTA vial) 2nd sample: Biochemical test for hemolysis (plain red vial) Urine Test for hemoglobinuria (hemolysis). Continue the blood transfusion and perform an ECG (Option B) : Continuing the transfusion could worsen the reaction. The first step in managing a suspected transfusion reaction is stopping the transfusion. Investigate for clerical errors in the blood transfusion process (Option C) : While clerical errors (e.g., blood type mismatch) are important to rule out, the immediate priority is to stop the transfusion and stabilize the patient before investigating further. Administer corticosteroids and monitor vital signs (Option D) : Corticosteroids may be used in certain reactions (such as allergic reactions), but the first step should be stopping the transfusion and addressing any immediate complications (e.g., hypotension, fever). Corticosteroids are not the first-line treatment for most transfusion reactions. Reference: Robbins & Cotran Pathological Basis of Diseases, 10th Edition, Page 671-672.

      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "routine screening for dengue in donated blood is not typically performed. This is because mosquitoes primarily transmit dengue rather than through blood transfusions. Screening for transfusion-transmitted infections: The following infections can be transmitted by blood transfusion. Viral Bacterial Parasites Others Hepatitis (A, B, C, G) HIV (I & II) HTLV (I & II) CMV EBV Parvovirus B19 Syphilis Malaria Babesiosis Trypanosoma cruzi Creutzfeldt- Jakob disease Plasma processing methods have been shown to inactivate most recognized infectious organisms, except for non-lipid-enveloped viruses and prions. All clinically relevant blood components transmit prion disease following a single blood transfusion. Malaria can also be transmitted by most blood components (red cells, platelets, white-cell concentrates, cryoprecipitates, and frozen red cells after thawing and washing). Transmission from single-donor FFP has not been reported. In India, the following five diseases are screened: HBV (Option D) HCV (Option A) HIV (Option C) Malaria Syphilis Screening for the diseases mentioned above is mandatory , and transfusing unscreened blood is a medical offence.

      "question": "A patient has been brought with severe bleeding to your ER. His blood group is unknown. Fresh frozen plasma from which of the following blood groups can be given?",
      "options": {
        "A": "O",
        "B": "AB",
        "C": "B",
        "D": "A"

      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Correct answer: B) AB Explanation: In the given scenario where the blood group is unknown, fresh frozen plasma from blood group AB can be safely administered to the patient. Blood group AB individuals are considered universal plasma donors because their plasma lacks both A and B antibodies, making it compatible with recipients of any ABO blood type without causing an ABO incompatibility reaction. The differences between Rh Blood Group and ABO Blood Group: Properties ABO system Rh system Blood groups A, B, AB, and O Rh-positive & negative Genetic loci On chromosome 9 On chromosome 1 Ag and Ab Group Antigen Antibody C, c, D, E, & e antigens. ‘d’ indicates the absence of D. Most important: Anti-D antibody. O H Anti-A & anti-B A A Anti-B B B Anti-A AB A & B None Antigens also seen on/in Endothelial & epithelial cells, plasma, saliva, and semen (not seen in CSF) No other cells Type of Ab IgM (naturally occurring). IgG (does not occur naturally). Clinical significance Anti-A & anti-B can cause severe intravascular haemolysis after incompatible transfusion. ABO-matching is required before the transplantation of solid organs. Rh -ve individuals make anti-D Ab if: Transfused with Rh +ve blood.

      },
      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: A) Graft versus host disease Explanation: Transfusion of irradiated red blood cells (RBCs) can prevent graft versus host disease (GVHD). Steps for Production of Red Blood Cell Concentrates (RBCC) from Whole Blood 1 Whole Blood Collection Blood is drawn into sterile bags with anticoagulants to prevent clotting. Each unit contains 450-500 mL. (First 20-30 ml is discarded due to skin flora contamination) 2 Slow Speed Centrifugation (Soft Spin) Separates Red Blood Cell Concentrate (RBCC) at the bottom and Platelet-Rich Plasma (PRP) at the top, with the buffy coat (white blood cells) in between. 3 RBCC Processing and Additive Solutions After removing plasma and buffy coat, additive solutions like SAGM (Saline, Adenine, Glucose, Mannitol) or CPD are added to preserve cell viability and extend shelf life. 4 Leukoreduction/ Deleucocytation Achieved by filtering RBCC to remove >99.9% of white blood cells. Purpose: Nonhemolytic Febrile Transfusion Reactions (NHFTRs) . (Option D ruled out) Alloimmunization and platelet transfusion refractoriness. (Option B ruled out) Transfusion-transmitted infections, such as cytomegalovirus (CMV). Immunomodulation risks from transfusions (Option C ruled out) Post-reduction leukocyte content: <1–5 x 10 I leukocytes/unit. 5 Irradiation (Optional) RBCC is irradiated with X-rays or gamma rays (25–35 Gy). Purpose: Prevents graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) by inactivating donor lymphocytes. (Option A) Use: RBCC must be transfused within 24 hours post-irradiation. 6 Plasma Reduction (Optional) Plasma proteins are removed to prevent allergic or anaphylactic reactions. Purpose: Useful for patients with a history of allergic transfusion reactions, reducing post-transfusion anaphylaxis risk. 7 Cryopreservation (Optional) RBCC is cryopreserved at -80°C, mainly for rare blood types. Purpose: Extends shelf life up to 30 years, increasing availability of rare blood groups.

      "question": "A 24-year-old man, after being involved in a road traffic accident (RTA), was brought to the casualty 6 hours later. His B.P. was 90/60 mm Hg, heart rate was 110/min, and SpO2 was 92%. A blood transfusion was administered. A few hours later, the patient becomes febrile and tachypneic and starts bleeding from the IV and NG tube sites. His SpO2 levels begin to drop. What is the likely cause?",

      },
      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: A) Transfusion reaction Explanation: The patient's fever, tachypnea, bleeding from IV and NG tube sites, and declining SpO2 after transfusion suggest an acute transfusion reaction, likely due to an immune response causing hemolysis, shock, and DIC. Types of Transfusion reactions Aspect Immediate Transfusion Reactions Delayed Transfusion Reactions Onset Within hours of transfusion Days to weeks after transfusion Cause Immunologic reactions, hemolytic or non-hemolytic Immune-mediated, often involving minor antigen sensitization Presentation Fever, chills, dyspnea (TRALI, TACO), Acute respiratory distress (TRALI), Pulmonary oedema (TACO), hypothermia, electrolyte abnormalities, coagulopathy , acid-base disorders and hyperkalemia. Fever, jaundice, gradual decline in haemoglobin levels (hemolysis). Severity Can range from mild to life-threatening. Generally less severe than immediate reactions. Examples Febrile non-hemolytic reaction (FNHTR) Transfusion-related acute lung injury (TRALI) Transfusion-associated circulatory overload (TACO) Delayed hemolytic reaction Management Stop transfusion and manage symptoms. Supportive care (e.g., antipyretics, oxygen). Monitor for worsening anaemia and hemolysis. Consider further transfusion support if indicated.

      "question": "Why is blood stored in citrate-phosphate-dextrose (CPD) preferred over acid-citrate-dextrose (ACD) for hypoxic patients?",
      "options": {
        "A": "It has less P50",
        "B": "It is less acidic",
        "C": "The fall in 2,3-DPG is less",
        "D": "None of the above"
      },
      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: C) The fall in 2,3-DPG is less Explanation: 2,3-DPG (2,3-diphosphoglycerate) is important for facilitating oxygen release from haemoglobin to tissues. CPD helps maintain higher levels of 2,3-DPG during blood storage compared to ACD, which is crucial for better oxygen delivery to tissues. 2,3-DPG is a molecule that binds to haemoglobin, promoting the release of oxygen to tissues. During blood storage, 2,3-DPG levels gradually decrease. A reduction in 2,3-DPG leads to a leftward shift in the oxygen dissociation curve, which decreases oxygen release to tissues. This can be harmful to hypoxic patients, as they already have compromised oxygen delivery Reference: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/239292/",
