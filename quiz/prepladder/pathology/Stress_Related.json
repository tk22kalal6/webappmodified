      "question": "A sample of tissue preparation is subjected to oxidative stress under experimental conditions. Different types of free radicals are generated in the process.

      },
      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "Correct answer: A) Hydroxyl radical. Explanation: The hydroxyl radical (OH•) is considered the most potent and reactive free radical due to its high reactivity and ability to quickly react with cellular components, leading to oxidative damage. Hydroxyl radicals are primarily formed through the Fenton reaction, which involves the interaction of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) with transition metal ions such as iron (Fe) or copper (Cu). Another source of hydroxyl radicals is the Haber-Weiss reaction, which occurs in the presence of superoxide radicals (O2-) and hydrogen peroxide.

These are the tell-tale signs of free radical injury. On ageing, atrophy of organs occur, causing free radical injury.

      "explanation": "(H2O2) Correct answer: C) Neutralization of superoxide anion radicals (O2•-) into hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) Explanation: Superoxide dismutase (SOD) is an important enzyme found in cells that plays a crucial role in antioxidant defence mechanisms. Its primary function is to catalyze the conversion of superoxide radicals (O2•-) into oxygen (O2) and hydrogen peroxide (H2O2). SOD is classified into different types based on its metal cofactor, such as Copper/zinc SOD (Cu/Zn SOD) found in the cytoplasm Manganese SOD (Mn-SOD) in the mitochondria Extracellular SOD (EC-SOD) located outside the cell.

He reports difficulty with tasks such as buttoning shirts and lifting objects. On examination, you note fasciculations in his upper extremities and decreased muscle strength. His reflexes are brisk, and there is no sensory deficit. Nerve conduction studies show signs of denervation. Genetic testing reveals a mutation in the SOD1 gene.

      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Correct answer: C) Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) Explanation The SOD1 gene encodes for the enzyme superoxide dismutase 1 (SOD1), which plays a crucial role in protecting cells (Brain) from oxidative stress. Mutations in the SOD1 gene are associated with familial cases of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). ALS is a progressive neurodegenerative disease that affects motor neurons in the brain and spinal cord, leading to muscle weakness, atrophy, and eventually paralysis. Mutant forms of SOD1 can have toxic effects on neurons. Reference: Robbins and Cotran Pathologic Basis of Disease, 10th Edition, Pages 67, 68",

        "A": "Facilitating the degradation of misfolded proteins",
        "B": "Promoting protein folding and preventing misfolding",

        "D": "Transporting proteins across cellular membranes"
      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Correct answer: B) Promoting protein folding and preventing misfolding Explanation: Chaperones in the ER are responsible for properly folding newly synthesized proteins, and misfolded polypeptides are shuttled into the cytoplasm where they are ubiquitinated and targeted for proteolysis in proteasomes. If unfolded or misfolded proteins accumulate in the ER, they trigger the unfolded protein response. The unfolded protein response activates signalling pathways that increase the production of chaperones, enhance proteasomal degradation of abnormal proteins, and slow protein translation, thus reducing a load of misfolded proteins in the cell. Disease Misfolded protein Creutzfeldt-Jacob disease Prions Cystic fibrosis Cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) Facilitating the degradation of misfolded proteins (Option A): proteasome degrades misfolded or damaged proteins that have been tagged with ubiquitin. This ensures protein quality control and prevents toxic protein accumulation in the cell. Catalyzing enzymatic reactions by providing a scaffold (Option C): Enzymes accelerate biochemical reactions by stabilizing the transition state and providing an active site, a structural scaffold where substrates can interact efficiently. Transporting proteins across cellular membranes (Option D): Translocons are membrane-embedded channels that facilitate the movement of proteins across or into membranes, such as into the endoplasmic reticulum or mitochondria.

      "explanation": "Correct answer: B) Ubiquitin-proteasome pathway Explanation: The ubiquitin-proteasome pathway is primarily responsible for the degradation of misfolded proteins within the cell. In this pathway, misfolded or damaged proteins are tagged with ubiquitin molecules, which target them for degradation by the proteasome, a large multi-subunit protein complex. Dysfunction of the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway can lead to the accumulation of misfolded proteins and contribute to the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative diseases such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and Parkinson's disease.
