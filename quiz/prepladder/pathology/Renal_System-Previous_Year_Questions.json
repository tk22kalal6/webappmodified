      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: B) Minimal change disease Explanation: Effacement of podocyte foot processes refers to the flattening or loss of the foot processes of podocytes, specialized cells located in the kidney's glomerulus. This structural change is a hallmark of minimal change disease (also called minimal change nephrotic syndrome) . It presents with severe proteinuria, hypoalbuminemia, edema, and lipiduria. While the glomeruli appear normal under light microscopy, the characteristic finding of podocyte foot process effacement can only be observed under electron microscopy. It is the most common cause of nephrotic syndrome in children (2-6 years) and responds well to corticosteroid therapy. Steroid-resistant glomerulonephritis (Option A) does not typically show effacement of podocyte foot processes. Instead, it may show more severe glomerular damage. Rapidly progressive glomerulonephritis (RPGN) (Option C) is marked by crescent formation in the glomeruli and is not typically associated with podocyte effacement. Chronic glomerulonephritis (Option D) is associated with sclerosis and fibrosis in the glomeruli, and effacement of podocyte foot processes is not a characteristic finding.",

(Most common) Tumour Characteristics : Composed of cells with clear or granular cytoplasm and a nonpapillary pattern. Familial vs. Sporadic : Primarily sporadic (95%), but can also be familial. Genetic Alterations : Loss of sequences on the short arm of chromosome 3 in 98% of cases. The VHL gene, located in this region, is a key tumour suppressor gene. Classic triad of flank pain, palpable mass, and hematuria is commonly observed in kidney tumours, although it may not be present in all cases. Morphology: Origin : Arises from proximal tubular epithelium. Gross Appearance : Bright yellow-gray-white spherical masses. Yellow colour due to lipid accumulation in tumour cells. It may have areas of necrosis, haemorrhage, and cystic regions. Histopathology: Most tumours are well-differentiated & some may show nuclear atypia, bizarre nuclei, and giant cells. The growth pattern varies from solid to trabecular (cordlike) or tubular (resembling tubules). The tumour cells have a rounded or polygonal shape and abundant clear or granular cytoplasm containing glycogen and lipids. The tumours have delicate branching vasculature and may show cystic and solid areas.

      "explanation": "Correct Answer: C) Renal casts Explanation: Tamm-Horsfall protein, produced in the ascending limb of the loop of Henle, is the most abundant protein in normal urine and serves as a marker of tubular function. It plays a key role in preventing urinary tract infections and is the primary component of hyaline casts, the most common type of urinary casts. Incorrect Options: Mural thrombi (Option A) are blood clots that stick to the walls of blood vessels or the heart. They are not related to the Tamm-Horsfall protein , which is specific to renal tubular function and not involved in thrombus formation. Curschmann spirals (Option B) are mucus plugs found in the sputum of patients with asthma or other obstructive pulmonary diseases. Bence-Jones proteins (Option D) are free immunoglobulin light chains found in urine and are linked to multiple myeloma. Unlike the Tamm-Horsfall protein, which is a normal renal protein involved in renal casts, Bence-Jones proteins are abnormal products resulting from plasma cell malignancies.

It is often associated with hepatitis B and is characterised by the spike and dome pattern on kidney biopsy due to subepithelial immune complex deposition (primarily IgG and C3) . Membranous Nephropathy: M/C cause of nephrotic syndrome in elderly patients. It is immune complex-mediated and can be caused by malignancy (colon, lung, melanoma), infections(malaria, hepatitis B, C, syphilis, schistosomiasis), drugs (gold, penicillamine), or autoimmune conditions (SLE). In primary membranous nephropathy, antibodies primarily target the M-type phospholipase A2 receptor (PLA2R) located on the basal surface of podocytes. This triggers complement activation and subepithelial immune complex deposition , resembling Heymann nephritis lesions. Other less common target antigens include THSD7A and neutral endopeptidase ( CD10 ) . The presence of anti-PLA2R antibodies is crucial for diagnosing the disease.

      "explanation": "Correct Answer: B) Subepithelial deposits Explanation: The clinical presentation, including cola-coloured urine , hypertension , edema , and rising creatinine levels, is highly suggestive of acute glomerulonephritis , particularly post-streptococcal glomerulonephritis (PSGN). Subepithelial deposits are characteristic of PSGN in electron microscopy. Pathological findings in PSGN Grossly Kidneys appear speckled or mottled due to numerous small haemorrhages (Flea-bitten appearance) .

      "explanation": "Correct Answer: B) Alpha 2 globulin Explanation: Nephrotic syndrome is characterized by proteinuria , hypoalbuminemia , edema , and hyperlipidemia, and the electrophoresis shows decreased albumin levels and increased levels of alpha-2 globulin. The increase in alpha-2 globulin is due to an increase in macroglobulin, which is a larger protein , and its increase in the bloodstream serves as a compensatory mechanism in nephrotic syndrome to counteract the loss of albumin . Gamma globulin (Option A) does not increase significantly . An increase in gamma globulins is seen in conditions like multiple myeloma or chronic inflammatory conditions , not in nephrotic syndrome. Beta globulin (Option C) increases, but this increase is typically modest compared to the marked rise in alpha-2 globulins . Albumin (Option D) is the major protein that decreases in size on electrophoresis in nephrotic syndrome due to its significant loss in the urine, leading to hypoalbuminemia .

Painless hematuria may occur intermittently or be persistent, and it is an important warning sign that should prompt further evaluation for bladder cancer. Incorrect Options: Option B - Painful hematuria: While hematuria can sometimes be associated with pain, especially in conditions such as urinary tract infections or kidney stones, painful hematuria is less commonly seen in bladder carcinoma. Bladder carcinoma typically presents with painless hematuria as the primary symptom. Option C - Dysuria: Dysuria refers to painful or difficult urination and is not a consistent feature of bladder carcinoma. Dysuria is more commonly associated with urinary tract infections. Option D - Suprapubic mass: The presence of a suprapubic mass is not a specific or consistent feature of bladder carcinoma. Bladder carcinoma may lead to the development of a bladder tumor or a thickened bladder wall, but the presence of a palpable mass is less common. Reference: Prepladder Notes",

This pattern shows granular deposits of IgG, IgA, IgM, C3, and C1q throughout the glomeruli. The \"full house\" pattern indicates the deposition of immune complexes containing multiple types of antibodies and complement components. Incorrect Options: Option A - Focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS): In FSGS, the immunofluorescence may not reveal any specific immune deposits or show only mild or nonspecific deposits. Option B - Post-streptococcal glomerulonephritis (PSGN): In PSGN, the immunofluorescence findings show granular deposits of IgG, IgM, and C3 along the glomerular basement membrane. These immune deposits represent the immune complex deposition caused by the immune response to the streptococcal infection. Option C - Good pasture syndrome: The immunofluorescence findings in Good pasture syndrome reveal linear deposits of IgG along the GBM. These linear deposits correspond to the binding of anti-GBM antibodies to the GBM. Reference: Prepladder Notes",
