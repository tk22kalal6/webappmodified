      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "Correct answer: A) 1-iii, 2-i, 3-iv, 4-ii Explanation: Exon : An exon is a coding region of a gene that contains the genetic information necessary for producing a functional protein. Intron : An intron is a non-coding region of a gene that intervenes between exons. During gene expression, introns are removed from the pre-mRNA molecule through splicing, which allows exons to be joined together to form the final mRNA transcript before translation into a protein. Locus : A locus refers to the specific location of a gene or DNA sequence on a chromosome. Allele : An allele is one of the alternate forms of a single gene occupying a given position in a chromosome , which can lead to different traits or characteristics. Alleles can be dominant or recessive. Reference: Robbins and Cotrans Pathological Basis of Diseases, 10th Edition, Page 459",

      "question": "A 25-year-old male from a tribal area of Madhya Pradesh presents to the clinic with complaints of fatigue and shortness of breath. On examination, he appears pale, and jaundice is noted. Laboratory investigations reveal low hemoglobin levels and increased reticulocyte count. The peripheral blood smear shows numerous sickle-shaped erythrocytes. What is the most likely molecular mechanism underlying the pathogenesis of this patient's condition?",
      "options": {
        "A": "Chromosomal translocation",

        "C": "Frameshift mutation",
        "D": "Nonsense mutation"
      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Correct answer: B) Missense mutation Explanation: The clinical presentation of a tribal male with the above-mentioned clinical features and sickle-shaped RBCs in the peripheral smear suggests sickle cell disease. A missense mutation (type of point mutation) is the underlying mechanism in the pathogenesis of this disease. Point mutation: A point mutation is a change in which a single base is substituted with a different base. Types: Missense mutation It can be: Sickle cell anaemia. This point mutation involves substituting adenine for thymine at the sixth codon of the β -globin gene (GAG to GTG) , replacing glutamic acid with valine in the β -globin chain of haemoglobin. This single nucleotide change results in the formation of abnormal haemoglobin molecules (HbS) . Nonsense mutation (Option D) Change of an amino acid to a chain terminator or stop codon. (UAA, UGA, UAG) Example: Beta thalassemia This change leads to premature termination of β -globin gene translation, and the short peptide that is produced is rapidly degraded. Chromosomal translocation (Option A) involves the exchange of genetic material between non-homologous chromosomes. E.g. Chronic myeloid leukemia- t(9;22). A frameshift mutation (Option C) is a type of genetic mutation that results from the insertion or deletion of nucleotides in a DNA sequence, causing a shift in the reading frame during translation. E.g., Cystic fibrosis: A three-base deletion in the common cystic fibrosis (CF) allele results in the synthesis of a protein that lacks amino acid 508 (phenylalanine).

      "question": "A couple visits a genetics counselor due to concerns about their baby's blood type. The father has blood type A (genotype I A I A ), and the mother has blood type B (genotype I B I B ). The counselor explains that blood type is determined by codominant alleles, where both alleles contribute equally to the phenotype in the heterozygous condition. Which of the following best describes codominance?",
      "options": {
        "A": "One allele completely masks the expression of the other allele",
        "B": "The phenotype of the heterozygote is intermediate between the phenotypes of the homozygotes",
        "C": "Only one allele is expressed, while the other remains silent",
        "D": "Both alleles contribute to the phenotype equally in the heterozygous condition"
      },
      "correct_answer": "D",
      "explanation": "Correct answer : D) Both alleles contribute to the phenotype equally in the heterozygous condition are equally expressed . Examples: ABO blood group system In the ABO blood group system, the I A and I B alleles are codominant in producing the AB blood group phenotype, in which both A and B-type antigens are produced. The genes responsible for the ABO blood group are located in chromosome 9. The presence of both I A and I B causes the expression of both , forming the AB blood group.

      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "dysfunctional or inactive protein. Correct answer: B) Most mutations lead to reduced production of a gene product or give rise to a dysfunctional or inactive protein. Explanation : The given clinical scenario of a male with tall stature , long limbs , joint hypermobility , arachnodactyly , aortic root dilatation , and similar features in his father suggests Marfan’s syndrome , an autosomal dominant condition. The true statement regarding autosomal dominant inheritance is that most proteins lead to reduced production of a gene product or give rise to a dysfunctional or inactive protein. Autosomal dominant inheritance: Autosomal dominant disorders are manifested in the heterozygous state, so at least one parent of an index case is usually affected. It is the most common mode of inheritance. (Option D) Both males and females are affected, and both can transmit the condition. (Option A) They are characterized by: With every autosomal dominant disorder, some proportion of patients do not have affected parents. Clinical features can be modified by variations in penetrance and expressivity: Some individuals inherit the mutant gene but are phenotypically normal. This is referred to as incomplete penetrance . (Option C) If a trait is seen in all individuals carrying the mutant gene but is expressed differently among individuals, the phenomenon is called variable expressivity. In many conditions the age at onset is delayed; symptoms and signs may not appear until adulthood. Pedigree chart: A vertical pattern in the pedigree chart: Individuals of each generation are affected (parent and children). Affected individuals have a 50% chance of passing on the deleterious gene to the offspring. Some examples of autosomal dominant disorders:",

      "explanation": "Correct answer: D) Autosomal Recessive Inheritance, Mutation in the GBA Gene Explanation : Gaucher disease is an autosomal recessive inborn error of metabolism caused by mutations in the glucocerebrosidase - GBA1 gene. Three clinical subtypes of Gaucher disease have been distinguished: Type I: Chronic non-neuronopathic form. Type II: Acute neuronopathic form, also known as infantile acute cerebral pattern. Type III: Intermediate between types I and II. MORPHOLOGY: In Gaucher disease, glucocerebrosides accumulate massively within phagocytic cells throughout the body, forming distended cells known as Gaucher cells. These cells, found in various organs including the spleen, liver, bone marrow, and lungs, exhibit a fibrillar cytoplasm resembling crumpled tissue paper. They stain intensely positive with periodic acid–Schiff staining.

(chromosome 7) X-linked Recessive Inheritance, Mutation in the GBA Gene (Option B): Gaucher disease is not associated with X-linked inheritance; instead, it follows autosomal recessive inheritance. Autosomal Dominant Inheritance, Mutation in the HEXA Gene (Option C) Tay-Sachs disease is an autosomal recessive disorder caused by mutations in the HEXA gene, resulting in deficient activity of the enzyme β -hexosaminidase A There are two isoenzymes of β -hexosaminidase: Hex A, consisting of two subunits, α and β , and Hex B, a homodimer of β -subunits. Tay-Sachs disease, the most common form of GM2 gangliosidosis, results from mutations in the α -subunit locus on chromosome 15 that cause a severe deficiency of hexosaminidase A Features of Tay Sachs disease: Onion skin appearance Cherry red spot",

      "explanation": "sphingomyelinase Correct answer: A) Diagnosis: Niemann-Pick disease type A, Enzyme Deficiency: Acid sphingomyelinase Explanation : Niemann-Pick disease types A and B are related disorders characterized by lysosomal accumulation of sphingomyelin due to an inherited deficiency of sphingomyelinase. Type A is a severe infantile form with extensive neurologic involvement, marked visceral accumulations of sphingomyelin, progressive wasting and early death within the first 3 years of life. In contrast, patients with type B disease have organomegaly but generally no central nervous system involvement. Patients usually survive into adulthood. Affected cells become enlarged, due to the distention of lysosomes with sphingomyelin and cholesterol, imparting foaminess to the cytoplasm. Image : Niemann-Pick disease in the liver. The hepatocytes and Kupffer cells have a foamy, vacuolated appearance due to the deposition of lipids.

X-linked dominant disorders are genetic conditions caused by mutations in genes located on the X chromosome. Unlike X-linked recessive disorders, which affect males more commonly due to having only one X chromosome, X-linked dominant disorders affect both males and females. All fathers that are affected by an X-linked dominant disorder will have affected daughters but not affected sons. However, if the mother is also affected then sons will have a chance of being affected, depending on whether a dominant or recessive X chromosome is passed on. When the son is affected, the mother will always be affected.
