      },
      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "Inhalation of these fibers leads to the formation of scar tissue and fibrosis in the lungs. It is characterized by the presence of asbestos bodies, which are asbestos fibers surrounded by iron-containing proteins, within lung tissue. The disease can cause symptoms such as shortness of breath, coughing, and chest tightness. In the histopathology picture, the presence of lung fibrosis and thickening of the pleura is consistent with the diagnosis of asbestosis. Incorrect Option: Option B. Silicosis: Silicosis is a lung disease caused by the inhalation of crystalline silica dust. It leads to the development of fibrous tissue in the lungs, similar to asbestosis. However, silicosis is characterized by the presence of silica particles within the lung tissue rather than asbestos bodies. Occupational exposure to industries such as mining, sandblasting, or stone cutting is commonly associated with silicosis. Option C . Tuberculosis: Tuberculosis (TB) is an infectious disease caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis. It primarily affects the lungs but can also involve other organs. TB is characterized by the formation of granulomas, which are nodular inflammatory lesions, in the affected tissues. In the lungs, TB granulomas typically contain caseous necrosis, which appears as cheesy or crumbly material on histopathology. While TB can cause lung fibrosis in advanced cases, the thickening of the pleura mentioned in the question is not a typical finding of tuberculosis.",

      },
      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: A) Alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency Explanation: The clinical presentation and the gross specimen showing emphysematous damage involving the enlargement of the entire acinus are consistent with panacinar emphysema . This pattern of emphysema is most commonly associated with alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency . Alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency: It is an autosomal recessive disorder caused by mutations in the alpha-1 antitrypsin gene located on Chromosome 14 . Normal individuals have the PiMM genotype , while those with the disease have the PiZZ genotype. This results in significantly reduced levels of functional alpha-1 antitrypsin protein. Carriers possess the PiMZ genotype. The condition primarily affects the lungs, leading to panacinar emphysema and the liver, causing cirrhosis due to abnormal protein accumulation. Emphysema is classified according to its anatomic distribution within the lobule. Based on the segments of the respiratory units that are involved, emphysema is subdivided into four major types: Features Centriacinar (M/C) Panacinar Paraseptal Irregular Involves Proximal acinus Proximal & distal acini Distal acinus Irregular involvement Site Upper lobes, especially apical segments Lower zones & anterior margins of the lung. More severe at the base of the lung. The upper half of the lungs (more severe). Airspaces can form cyst-like structures. Any part of the lung can be involved. Aetiology Smokers Chronic bronchitis α 1-antitrypsin deficiency Spontaneous pneumothorax Depends on involvement, most found in autopsy The image below shows centriacinar emphysema.",

      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: C) Asbestosis Explanation: The patient’s prolonged asbestos exposure, chronic cough, shortness of breath, and chest pain suggest asbestosis, a form of interstitial lung disease (ILD). Imaging findings, including bilateral interstitial opacities and honeycombing on HRCT, along with a restrictive pattern on pulmonary function tests, support the diagnosis of asbestos-induced pulmonary fibrosis. Asbestos exposure is a well-established risk factor for developing laryngeal, ovarian, colon, lung, and pleural cancers. Asbestos-related lung carcinoma is markedly magnified by smoking. Thus, asbestos workers (particularly those who smoke) are at much higher risk of dying of lung carcinoma than mesothelioma. Compared to other occupational lung diseases, which affect the upper lobes of the lungs, it commonly affects the lower lobes. Adenocarcinoma (primary bronchogenic carcinoma ) is the most common type of cancer, accounting for about 45%, followed by squamous cell carcinoma. Lung mesothelioma is a more specific tumour associated with asbestos exposure but is less prevalent than Adenocarcinoma.",

COVID-19 (SARS-CoV-2): Transmission: It likely originated from a seafood and animal market in Wuhan. Initial animal-to-human transmission, followed by human-to-human spread. Clinical features: Range from mild flu-like symptoms to severe respiratory illness. Severe cases often involve respiratory compromise and bilateral ground-glass opacities on chest imaging. It is more severe in older adults and individuals with comorbidities (e.g., diabetes, COPD, heart failure). Pathology: Histologic analysis of lung tissue shows diffuse alveolar damage and inflammation, primarily with mononuclear cells.

      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: B) Type-4 hypersensitivity reaction Explanation: The given scenario of cough, fever, hemoptysis, and a cavitary lesion with caseous necrosis at the right lung apex strongly suggests Pulmonary Tuberculosis , which involves a type-4 hypersensitivity reaction. CD4+ T cells activate macrophages, but Mycobacterium tuberculosis survives within them, causing granuloma formation with caseous necrosis, driven by a type 4 hypersensitivity reaction and resulting in tissue damage. It is a bacterial infection caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis and can be classified into the following types: 1. Primary tuberculosis It develops in a previously unexposed and, therefore, unsensitized person. The primary organ involved is mostly the lungs. Location: Sub-pleural region. Lower part of the upper lobe & upper part of the lower lobe. Ghon’s focus: Grey-white area of inflammation with consolidation. Ghon’s complex: Ghon’s focus + inflamed regional lymph nodes. Histology : Granulomatous inflammatory reaction with both caseating and non-caseating tubercles. Simon’s focus: Occult hematogenous dissemination to the apex of the lung. Fate: 95% of the cases are controlled by immunity, calcified, healed lesions and hilar lymph nodes (Ranke complex) . 5% of the cases are progressive (Progressive primary TB) . Resembles acute bacterial pneumonia. Lymphohematogenous dissemination may cause tuberculous meningitis and/or miliary TB. 2. Secondary tuberculosis It arises in a previously sensitised host. It may follow shortly after primary tuberculosis, but more commonly, it appears months to years after the initial infection, usually when the host resistance is weakened. The apical and posterior lobe segments are involved due to high O 2 concentration (Puhl’s focus) . The infraclavicular lesion is called Assman’s focus. Regional lymph node involvement is late. Cavitation occurs readily with the erosion of the cavities into an airway. Histology: Active lesions show coalescent tubercles with central caseation (Caseous necrosis). 3. Disseminated TB : Spread to other organs. The images below show the caseous necrosis seen in TB. Enzyme degradation (Option A) may be involved in the breakdown of tissue during infection. The primary mechanism of tissue damage in tuberculosis is the type-4 hypersensitivity reaction. Fibrinoid deposition (Option C) refers to the accumulation of fibrin-like material in the walls of blood vessels. It is typically associated with conditions such as vasculitis. Sudden cutoff of blood supply (Option D) occurs when the blood supply to a tissue is abruptly interrupted, leading to ischemia and subsequent tissue death. In the case of tuberculosis, the tissue damage is primarily caused by the immune response and the formation of granulomas.",

      "explanation": "Correct Answer: B) Asbestos Explanation: The histopathological image shows ferruginous bodies, suggestive of Asbestosis , indicating the person likely worked in the asbestos industry. It is a chronic lung condition caused by the inhalation of asbestos fibres over a prolonged period. These fibres accumulate in the lung tissue, leading to inflammation, fibrosis, and scarring. Symptoms: Includes shortness of breath, coughing, and chest tightness The histopathological features seen in asbestosis include: Interstitial fibrosis: Asbestos fibres cause injury to the lung parenchyma, resulting in the deposition of collagen and fibrous tissue in the interstitium. This fibrosis leads to thickening of the alveolar walls and restrictive lung function. Ferruginous bodies: Asbestos fibres can be recognized in the lung tissue as long, golden-brown, rod-shaped structures called ferruginous bodies. These bodies are composed of asbestos fibre coated with iron and protein. Silica (Option A) exposure is associated with a lung disease called silicosis. Histopathological features of silicosis include nodular lesions with silica particles,",

      "explanation": "Correct Answer: B) A Explanation: In the electron microscopic image of the lung tissue, the structure labelled \"A\" represents the endothelium, where SARS-CoV-2 infection would impact and cause expansion. It is the virus causing COVID-19. It leads to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Mechanism: The virus can directly infect the endothelial cells that line the blood vessels in the lungs, disrupting the normal function and integrity of the endothelial cells, resulting in increased vascular permeability, inflammation, and the onset of pulmonary edema. (Option B) Layer B (Option A) represents the basal lamina, which offers structural support to the epithelial cells and separates them from the underlying connective tissue. However, it is not the primary site of infection in SARS-CoV-2-related ARDS. Layer D (Option C) represents epithelium that lines the airways and plays a key role in the respiratory system's defence mechanisms. However, it is not the primary target in SARS-CoV-2-related ARDS, where the main pathological changes occur in the endothelium.

      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: A) Mesothelioma Explanation: Asbestosis, a pneumoconiosis caused by asbestos inhalation, is strongly associated with mesothelioma, a malignancy of the pleura or peritoneum. Asbestos exposure also increases the risk of lung, laryngeal, ovarian, colon, and pleural cancers. Smoking significantly amplifies the risk of asbestos-related lung carcinoma, making asbestos workers, especially smokers, more likely to die from lung cancer than mesothelioma. Compared to other occupational lung diseases, which affect the upper lobes of the lungs, it commonly affects the lower lobes. Adenocarcinoma (primary bronchogenic carcinoma ) is the most common type of cancer, accounting for about 45%, followed by squamous cell carcinoma. Lung mesothelioma is a more specific tumour associated with asbestos exposure. It is common but is less prevalent than Adenocarcinoma. Anthracosis (Option B) , associated with bronchial arthrofibrosis (BAF), is a condition characterised by the black staining of the bronchial mucosa, which can obstruct the bronchial lumen. It typically manifests in elderly non-smokers, either male or female, with a chronic course of symptoms like dyspnea and/or cough. It occurs due to the accumulation of carbon, silica, and quartz particles in macrophages, mucosa, and submucosa, leading to anthracosis. Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) (Option C) is the most common form of primary liver cancer. It typically develops in individuals with chronic liver diseases such as cirrhosis, which can be caused by chronic Hepatitis B or C infection. Other causes of cirrhosis include alcohol abuse, autoimmune diseases, chronic liver inflammation, and iron overload (hemochromatosis). HCC arises from long-term liver damage and scarring. Renal cell carcinoma (RCC) (Option D) is the most common type, accounting for approximately 90–95% of adult kidney cancers. It originates in the lining of the proximal convoluted tubules (PCTs). Symptoms of RCC include blood in the urine, flank pain, abdominal mass, weight loss, fever, high blood pressure, night sweats, and malaise. When RCC metastasises, it commonly spreads to the lymph nodes, lungs, liver, adrenal glands, brain, or bones.",

      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: B) Silicosis Explanation: Silicosis is a type of pneumoconiosis caused by inhalation of crystalline silica dust, which is commonly found in industries like sandblasting. It is associated with a higher risk of developing tuberculosis due to the impairment of the immune response in the lung Silicosis: It is the most prevalent occupational lung disease in the world. Cause: Inhalation of proinflammatory crystalline silicon dioxide (silica). After decades of exposure, it usually presents as slowly progressing, nodular, fibrosing pneumoconiosis. Occupations at risk: Foundry work. Sandblasting. Hard rock mining. Stone cutting. Jewellers using chalk moulds. Pathogenesis: Phagocytosis of inhaled silica crystals by macrophages activates the inflammasome and stimulates the release of inflammatory mediators, particularly IL-1 and IL-18. This, in turn, recruits additional inflammatory cells and activates interstitial fibroblasts, leading to collagen deposition. Forms of silica: Amorphous. Crystalline (quartz, cristobalite, and tridymite)- more fibrogenic. Forms of silicosis: Acute Heavy exposure in closed spaces Associated with Silico-tuberculosis and Secondary pulmonary alveolar proteinosis ( SPAP) Can present within 2 years. Chronic (simple): Long-term (10-30 years) less intense exposure. Chronic Complicated: Chronic cough and progressive dyspnea on exertion. Morphology: Discrete nodules in hilar nodes and upper zones of lungs. Hard collagenous scars. Fibrotic lesions in nodes and pleura (pleural thickening). Eggshell calcification (thin sheets of calcification in lymph nodes; calcium surrounding a zone lacking calcification). Progressive massive fibrosis (1-10 cm). Lung cancer (2-fold risk). Increased susceptibility to tuberculosis infection. Histological hallmark: Central collagen with a peripheral zone of dust-laden macrophages. Polarized microscopy: Weakly birefringent silicate particles. CT scan: Crazy pavement pattern and interstitial fibrosis. Asbestosis (Option A) is caused by inhaling asbestos fibres, primarily leading to lung fibrosis and increasing the risk of lung cancer and mesothelioma. However, it is not directly linked to an increased risk of tuberculosis. Anthracosis (Option C) , or \"coal miner’s lung,\" results from inhaling coal dust. It can cause chronic bronchitis or emphysema but does not have a direct association with tuberculosis. Siderosis (Option D) is caused by inhaling iron oxide dust, typically seen in occupations like welding. It can lead to pulmonary fibrosis but does not significantly increase the risk of tuberculosis.",

Mesothelioma A rare cancer arising from mesothelial cells that most commonly affects the pleura, and it can also affect the peritoneum, pericardium, and tunica vaginalis Etiology Mesothelioma is the most specific asbestos-associated cancer Pathology Advanced pleural mesothelioma can cause extensive pleural fibrosis and thickening, making the affected side rigid and immobile Later stages fix the mediastinum in place due to pleural thickening and fibrosis. A mediastinal shift is not a characteristic feature of mesothelioma. Clinical features Progressive dyspnea, chest pain, weight loss, chronic cough, hemoptysis Decreased breath sounds and dullness to percussion (due to pleural effusion or thickening). Diagnosis CT scan shows Pleural thickening, effusion, or frozen hemithorax (not causing a mediastinal shift in the presence of effusion) Biopsy (Diagnosis can be confirmed) Epithelioid mesothelioma shows tubules, nests, or papillary structures with uniform round to oval nuclei and eosinophilic cytoplasm. Sarcomatoid mesothelioma consists of spindle-shaped cells resembling fibrosarcoma. Biphasic mesothelioma displays a mixture of both patterns. Specific markers for mesothelioma Calretinin Epithelial membrane antigen Cytokeratin Mesothelin Prognosis Poor - median survival of 9-21 months Incorrect Options: Silicosis (Option A) is caused by the inhalation of silica dust , commonly seen in industries such as mining and construction.

Caplan’s syndrome It is characterised by the formation of multiple well-defined pulmonary nodules, typically located in the lung periphery, in individuals with rheumatoid arthritis who have been exposed to inorganic dust. It is primarily associated with coal worker's pneumoconiosis but can also occur in other forms of pneumoconiosis. B. Asbestosis It primarily affects the lower lobes of the lungs and increases the risk of laryngeal, ovarian, colon, lung, and pleural cancers, with lung cancer risk significantly heightened in smokers. Asbestos-related lung carcinoma typically targets the lower lobes, unlike other occupational lung diseases that affect the upper lobes. C. Mesothelioma It is a rare cancer originating from mesothelial cells, most commonly affecting the pleura. CT scan typically shows pleural thickening, effusion, or frozen hemithorax. It can also involve the peritoneum, pericardium, and tunica vaginalis. D. Silicosis It is the most prevalent occupational lung disease and is caused by inhaling proinflammatory crystalline silica. After decades of exposure, it typically presents as slowly progressing, nodular, fibrosing pneumoconiosis. The CT scan shows a \"crazy pavement\" pattern and interstitial fibrosis.

      "explanation": "Correct Answer: D) Squamous cell carcinoma Explanation: An elderly male smoker with chronic cough, weight loss, fatigue, and elevated serum calcium likely has squamous cell carcinoma of the lung. This cancer is associated with paraneoplastic hypercalcemia due to PTHrP secretion . The biopsy showing large atypical cells with hyperchromasia supports this diagnosis. Smoking significantly increases the risk of squamous cell carcinoma of the lung as it has a strong association, resulting in chromosomal deletions involving tumour suppressor loci involving 3p,9p and 17p. Squamous cell carcinoma: Squamous Cell Carcinoma is typically found in the central regions of the lungs (Not peripheral) , often originating in the major bronchi near the hilum. It can cause symptoms by obstructing airways. Histopathologically, it is characterised by keratin pearls, intercellular bridges , and nests of malignant squamous cells with abundant eosinophilic cytoplasm.
