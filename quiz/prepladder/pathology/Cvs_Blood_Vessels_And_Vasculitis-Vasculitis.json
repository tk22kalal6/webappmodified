      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: C) It occurs as a result of a B cell-mediated immune response. Explanation : The clinical presentation of a 68-year-old woman with worsening temporal headaches, jaw pain, visual disturbances, and tender and swollen right temporal artery points towards the diagnosis of giant cell arteritis. It occurs as a result of a T cell-mediated immune response. Giant cell arteritis: Giant cell (temporal) arteritis is a chronic, classically granulomatous inflammation of large- to medium-sized arteries that principally affects arteries in the head. (Option A) Epidemiology Most common type of vasculitis in adults (usually >50 years old) (Option B) Pathophysiology T cell-mediated immune response against vessel wall antigens. Contributions from pro-inflammatory cytokines (particularly TNF ) and anti-Endothelial Cell antibodies can be seen. An association with MHC class II haplotypes can be seen. Features Fever. Anaemia (normocytic normochromic). High ESR. Headaches (most common). Jaw claudication (most specific symptom). Sudden blindness (due to involvement of ophthalmic artery). Associated with polymyalgia rheumatica. (Option D) Arteries affected Temporal artery (most commonly involved). Vertebral artery. Ophthalmic artery. Aorta (giant cell aortitis).

      },
      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: A) Giant cell arteritis Explanation : An arterial biopsy obtained from an elderly patient showing giant cells and internal elastic lamina fragmentation suggests giant cell arteritis. Giant cell arteritis It is the most common vasculitis in adults ( >50 years of age). The most common vessel affected is the Superficial Temporal Artery. Clinical presentation: Unilateral throbbing headache Jaw claudication (pain) Loss of vision Polymyalgia rheumatica Morphology of giant cell arteritis: Microscopic examination: a large number of giant cells and granulomas. Involved arterial segments develop intimal thickening Classic lesions exhibit medial granulomatous inflammation centred on the internal elastic membrane with elastic lamina fragmentation ; there is an infiltrate of T cells (CD4+ > CD8+) and macrophages. Inflammatory lesions are only focally distributed along the vessel , and segments of relatively normal arteries may be interposed. The Verhoeff-Van Gieson stain is used for internal elastic lamina (black). Biopsy and histological confirmation of the temporal artery is the investigation of choice. Treatment: Corticosteroids Takayasu arteritis (Option B) Histologically, the changes range from adventitial mononuclear infiltrates with perivascular cuffing of the vasa vasorum to intense mononuclear inflammation in the media. Granulomatous inflammation, replete with giant cells and patchy medial necrosis , is also seen. As the disease progresses, collagenous scarring, with admixed chronic inflammatory infiltrates, occurs in all three vessel wall layers. Polyarteritis nodosa (Option C) During the acute phase, transmural inflammation of the arterial wall with a mixed infiltrate of neutrophils, eosinophils, and mononuclear cells occurs, frequently accompanied by fibrinoid necrosis and luminal thrombosis. Older lesions show fibrous thickening of the vessel wall extending into the adventitia. Characteristically, all stages of activity (from early to late) coexist in different vessels or even within the same vessel , suggesting ongoing injury. Associated with Hepatitis B and rarely",

      "question": "A 28-year-old female presents to the outpatient department with complaints of fatigue, weight loss, and intermittent claudication in her upper limbs. On further questioning, she reports occasional headaches and dizziness. Physical examination reveals absent pulses in both brachial arteries and decreased blood pressure in the upper extremities compared to the lower extremities. Laboratory investigations show elevated ESR & CRP, and Doppler ultrasound shows diffuse narrowing and irregularities in the brachial and subclavian arteries. What is the most likely diagnosis?",
      "options": {
        "A": "Rheumatoid arthritis",
        "B": "Takayasu arteritis",
        "C": "Polyarteritis nodosa",
        "D": "Microscopic polyangiitis"
      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: B) Takayasu arteritis Explanation : The clinical presentation is suggestive of Takayasu arteritis. Takayasu arteritis: Most common cause of renal artery stenosis in India → Leads to ostial narrowing, low GFR, and high renin hypertension. Commonly affects the left subclavian artery → Causes arm claudication , unequal BP between arms , and weak radial pulse . Investigation of choice → MR-Angiography (MRA). Treatment → Steroids. Rheumatoid arthritis (Option A) primarily affects the joints and is not typically associated with pulse abnormalities or arterial involvement, as seen in Takayasu arteritis. Polyarteritis nodosa (Option C) is a necrotising vasculitis that predominantly affects medium-sized arteries. It typically presents with systemic symptoms and may involve multiple organs, but it does not usually manifest with pulse abnormalities or arterial involvement in the upper extremities, as seen in Takayasu arteritis. Microscopic polyangiitis (Option D) is a small-vessel vasculitis characterised by necrotising inflammation affecting small arteries, arterioles, and capillaries. While it shares some similarities with Takayasu arteritis regarding systemic symptoms and laboratory findings, it primarily involves small vessels and typically presents with renal involvement, pulmonary haemorrhage, and skin manifestations. The characteristic pulse abnormalities and arterial involvement in Takayasu arteritis are not typical of microscopic polyangiitis.

      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: A) Polyarteritis nodosa (PAN) Explanation : The patient's symptoms, including fever, fatigue, weight loss, blood in stools, abdominal pain, and skin manifestations (livedo reticularis), along with the laboratory findings of elevated inflammatory markers, are all consistent with polyarteritis nodosa , a medium-vessel vasculitis that can affect multiple organ systems. Polyarteritis nodosa PAN is a systemic vasculitis of small- or medium-sized muscular arteries that typically affects renal and visceral vessels but spares the lungs (pulmonary circulation). Etiology Idiopathic One-third of patients with PAN have chronic hepatitis B , which leads to the formation of HBsAg-HbsAb complexes that deposit in affected vessels. Pathology Segmental transmural necrotising inflammation Acute phase: Transmural inflammation with mixed infiltrates of neutrophils, eosinophils, and mononuclear cells. Frequently accompanied by fibrinoid necrosis and luminal thrombosis. Chronic phase: Fibrosis and scarring of the arterial wall. Presentation Renal Involvement : Rapidly accelerating hypertension due to renal artery involvement. Renal ischemia or infarction may occur. Gastrointestinal Manifestations : Abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, and bloody stools due to mesenteric ischemia. Neurologic Symptoms : Peripheral neuritis (commonly motor nerves), mononeuritis multiplex. Musculoskeletal : Diffuse myalgias and arthralgias. Vascular Complications : Aneurysms, thrombosis, and vessel rupture. Other Organ Involvement : Kidneys, heart, liver, and gastrointestinal tract are most commonly affected (in descending order). Diagnosis Elevated ESR and CRP. Hepatitis B serology positive in associated cases. Renal function impairment in severe cases. Angiography shows aneurysms and stenoses in medium-sized vessels (“string-of-beads” appearance). Biopsy: Definitive diagnosis is made by biopsy of affected tissues, showing segmental transmural necrotizing inflammation. Treatment Corticositeorid Cyclophoshamide in refractory cases",

      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: A) Thromboangiitis Obliterans Explanation : Thromboangiitis obliterans (Buerger’s disease) It is characterized by segmental, thrombosing, acute and chronic inflammation of medium and small-sized arteries , especially the tibial and radial arteries, that often leads to vascular insufficiency, typically of the extremities. Etiology Occurs almost exclusively in heavy cigarette smokers , usually before the age of 35 Pathology Affected vessels of thromboangiitis obliterans show acute and chronic inflammation, accompanied by luminal thrombosis. The inflammatory process extends into contiguous veins and nerves (rare with other forms of vasculitis), and with time, all three structures can be encased in fibrous tissue Clinical features Recurrent episodes of pain and discolouration in the extremities , particularly with exposure to cold, along with superficial migratory thrombophlebitis. Imaging Doppler ultrasound findings may reveal segmental occlusions in the affected arteries, supporting the diagnosis. Raynaud's phenomenon (Option B) is a vasospastic disorder causing episodic discoloration (white, blue, red) of the fingers and toes, typically triggered by cold or stress. It is not associated with segmental arterial occlusions or migratory thrombophlebitis rather it occurs due to vasospasm of small arteries and arterioles Atherosclerosis (Option C) is a condition of large and medium-sized arteries characterized by plaque formation, leading to chronic narrowing of vessels, ischemia, and sometimes embolization. It involves lipid deposition and chronic changes, whereas thromboangiitis obliterans involves acute and chronic inflammatory processes and is segmental in nature. Giant cell arteritis (GCA) (Option D) is a large-vessel vasculitis primarily affecting the temporal and other cranial arteries. It is most common in individuals over the age of 50. Symptoms include headache, jaw claudication, visual disturbances, and systemic signs such as fever and weight loss.

      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: B) Segmental thrombosing vasculitis affecting small and medium-sized arteries of Buerger’s disease. It involves inflammation and thrombosis of small and medium-sized arteries , particularly in the distal extremities , leading to ischemia and tissue damage. In the above image, the lumen is occluded by thrombin-containing abscesses, and the vessel wall is infiltrated with leukocytes. Segmental fibrinoid necrosis of the media with focal transmural necrotising lesions (Option A) is a hallmark feature of polyarteritis nodosa (PAN), a systemic necrotizing vasculitis which affects medium-sized muscular arteries and is associated with fibrinoid necrosis and inflammation that spares arterioles, capillaries, and venules. Granulomatous inflammation of vessel walls (Option C) is a hallmark of large-vessel vasculitides, such as giant cell arteritis (GCA) and Takayasu arteritis. This involves multinucleated giant cells, primarily affecting the aorta and its major branches or cranial arteries. Adventitial mononuclear infiltrates with perivascular cuffing of the vasa vasorum (Option D) in syphilitic aortitis, part of tertiary syphilis. It involves inflammation in the adventitia, particularly around the vasa vasorum, leading to weakening of the aortic wall.

      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "elevated serum IgA levels, and RBC casts in urine is suggestive of Henoch-Schonlein purpura (HSP). Henoch-Schönlein Purpura (IgA vasculitis) It is a systemic vasculitis characterised by inflammation of small blood vessels , primarily affecting children, but can also occur in adults. Etiology Often follows upper respiratory tract infections Pathology Immune complex deposition of IgA in small blood vessels leads to inflammation Clinical features Inflammation of small blood vessels , primarily affecting children, but can also occur in adults. Associated with elevated serum IgA levels Skin : Palpable purpura, most prominently on the lower limbs and buttocks. Musculoskeletal : Arthralgia or arthritis, often transient and non-deforming. Gastrointestinal : Abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, and sometimes gastrointestinal bleeding, Intussusception is a severe but rare complication. Renal : Hematuria, proteinuria, and red blood cell casts in urine. Can progress to IgA nephropathy in severe cases. Management Supportive care : Hydration, rest, and pain management with NSAIDs for arthralgia. Glucocorticoids : For severe abdominal pain, renal involvement, or systemic symptoms. Intussusception : Surgical intervention if required. Nephritis : Immunosuppressants (e.g., cyclophosphamide) in severe cases. Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (Option B) is a multisystem autoimmune disease associated with ANA and anti-dsDNA antibodies, presenting with malar rash, arthritis, nephritis, and systemic symptoms. It does not present with palpable purpura or elevated IgA levels. Kawasaki Disease (Option C) is a type of Vasculitis of medium-sized vessels, primarily affecting children under 5 years. Clinical features include fever lasting ≥ 5 days, bilateral conjunctival injection, mucositis, rash, extremity changes, and cervical lymphadenopathy. Kawasaki disease involves larger vessels and lacks palpable purpura or elevated serum IgA. It typically presents with coronary artery complications.

      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: A) Wegener's Granulomatosis Explanation : The clinical presentation of a 55-year-old female with hematuria, hemoptysis, sinusitis, and renal biopsy showing pauci-immune necrotising crescentic glomerulonephritis is suggestive of Wegener’s granulomatosis. Wegener's Granulomatosis (Granulomatosis with Polyangiitis-GPA): It is characterised by pauci-immune necrotising granulomatous vasculitis affecting small- to medium-sized vessels. It commonly involves the respiratory tract ( sinusitis , pulmonary nodules , haemorrhage ) and kidneys ( rapidly progressive glomerulonephritis ). The presence of pauci-immune necrotising crescentic glomerulonephritis on renal biopsy is highly suggestive of GPA. In GPA, there is a presence of anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies (ANCA), specifically cytoplasmic ANCA (c-ANCA) targeting proteinase 3 (PR3) . Goodpasture Syndrome(Option B) is an autoimmune disorder characterised by the presence of antibodies targeting the basement membrane of the kidneys and lungs. Clinical features often include rapidly progressive glomerulonephritis (similar to GPA) along with pulmonary haemorrhage. It is characterised by the presence of anti-glomerular basement membrane (anti-GBM) antibodies . The renal biopsy findings in Goodpasture Syndrome typically show linear IgG deposition along the glomerular basement membrane. SLE(Option C) is a chronic autoimmune disease that can affect multiple organs, including the skin, joints, kidneys, and cardiovascular system. While SLE can involve the kidneys (lupus nephritis), pulmonary involvement in SLE may manifest differently than in GPA (e.g., pleuritis, pulmonary hypertension) and is not typically associated with the pauci-immune vasculitis seen in GPA. Laboratory findings in SLE often include positive antinuclear antibodies (ANA), anti-double-stranded DNA antibodies (anti-dsDNA), and specific criteria for lupus nephritis. Microscopic polyangiitis(Option D) (MPA) is another type of small-vessel vasculitis characterized by pauci-immune necrotizing vasculitis. Differentiating features include the absence of granulomatous inflammation seen in GPA and differences in the ANCA pattern (perinuclear ANCA or p-ANCA) targeting myeloperoxidase (MPO) rather than PR3.

      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: A) Microscopic Polyangiitis Explanation : The clinical presentation of rapidly progressive hematuria, hemoptysis, peripheral neuropathy, and MPO positivity points towards the diagnosis of microscopic polyangiitis. Microscopic Polyangiitis (MPA): It is a small vessel vasculitis affecting the capillaries, arterioles, and venules. It typically spares the medium-sized and larger arteries hence infarcts are uncommon. All the lesions are of the same age in any given patient and are distributed more widely. Clinical features include palpable cutaneous purpura , hemoptysis , hematuria , and proteinuria. Serologically, MPA is associated with the presence of perinuclear anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies ( p-ANCA ) targeting myeloperoxidase (MPO) , a key enzyme in neutrophils. Morphology: Granulomatous inflammation is absent. In some areas (typically postcapillary venules), only infiltrating and fragmenting neutrophils are seen, giving rise to leukocytoclastic vasculitis. Granulomatosis with Polyangiitis (Option B ) is typically associated with c-ANCA (anti-proteinase 3 antibodies), not p-ANCA. It presents with granulomatous inflammation, often involving the upper and lower respiratory tracts, and renal involvement. Eosinophilic Granulomatosis with Polyangiitis (EGPA) (Option C), formerly known as Churg-Strauss Syndrome, is a systemic vasculitis characterised by eosinophilic infiltration, granulomatous inflammation, and vasculitis affecting small to medium-sized vessels. It usually is associated with p-ANCA but often involves eosinophilia and asthma. Goodpasture Syndrome (Option D) is characterized by anti-glomerular basement membrane (anti-GBM) antibodies, not p-ANCA. It presents with rapidly progressive glomerulonephritis and pulmonary hemorrhage, resulting in hemoptysis, but does not typically include peripheral neuropathy.

Uveitis : most serious manifestations due to its potential for causing blindness. Other Symptoms: Joint pain ( arthritis ), skin lesions ( erythema nodosum ) (Option C) , vascular manifestations ( thrombophlebitis, deep vein thrombosis ), and neurological involvement Diagnosis Pathergy test (Option D): Non-specific hyperreactivity of the skin to trauma. Typically, a papule or pustule (>2 mm) forms in 24–48 hours after a needle prick. It is unique for Behcet disease, hence considered as a part of diagnostic criteria. Management Corticosteroids : Used to reduce acute inflammation. Immunosuppressants : azathioprine and cyclophosphamide may be used in severe cases to manage systemic involvement. TNF inhibitors such as infliximab or adalimumab may be considered for refractory cases or those with severe uveitis.

      "explanation": "Correct Answer: A) Churg-Strauss syndrome Explanation : The clinical presentation of a 25-year-old girl, k/c/o asthma with wheezing, rhinitis, and antibodies against neutrophil myeloperoxidase is suggestive of Churg Strauss syndrome. Churg Strauss syndrome Churg-Strauss syndrome (also called allergic granulomatosis and angiitis ) is a small-vessel necrotizing vasculitis classically associated with asthma , allergic rhinitis , lung infiltrates, peripheral eosinophilia, extravascular necrotizing granulomas , and eosinophilic infiltration of vessels and tissues. New name: Eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis. Vessels affected Small to medium sized arteries Clinical feature Asthma, allergic rhinitis, peripheral neuropathy, vasculitis and eosinophilic granulomas Diagnosis p-ANCA/MPO antibodies +ve, Eosinophilia, Biopsy shows granulomatous inflammation Management Cortoicosteroids Polyarteritis Nodosa (Option B) is a systemic necrotizing vasculitis that primarily affects medium-sized arteries. It is not associated with eosinophilia and usually does not show p-ANCA positivity. It presents with abdominal pain, muscle pain, and rapidly progressive hypertension. Buerger’s disease (Option C) is an inflammatory condition that affects small- and medium-sized arteries and veins. It is strongly associated with heavy smoking. It primarily affects the extremities and presents with claudication, raynaud's phenomenon, and ischemic ulcers. It does not involve asthma, eosinophilia, or MPO antibodies. Wegener Granulomatosis (Option D) is a type of vasculitis that affects small- and medium-sized vessels and is strongly associated with c-ANCA (cytoplasmic antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies). It is associated with upper and lower respiratory tract involvement, renal disease, and systemic symptoms. It may present with sinusitis, cough, hemoptysis, and glomerulonephritis.
