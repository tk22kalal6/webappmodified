      },
      "correct_answer": "D",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: D) Diaminobenzidine Explanation: 3,3 ′ -Diaminobenzidine (DAB) is a commonly used chromogen in immunohistochemistry (IHC) to detect HER2 overexpression in certain breast cancers. It serves as a substrate for a peroxidase enzyme coupled to a primary or secondary antibody. It is oxidised and converted to an insoluble polymer, precipitating as a dark brown pigment, which allows visualisation of the target molecule. FITC (Fluorescein Isothiocyanate) (Option A) is a fluorescent dye that is used in fluorescence microscopy to detect specific antigens but does not produce a brown colour. It would instead produce a green fluorescence. Phycoerythrin (Option B) is another fluorescent dye often used in flow cytometry and fluorescence microscopy but does not produce a brown colouration. It fluoresces red-orange and is used for labelling antibodies. Cyanate dye (Option C) is commonly used in fluorescence-based applications such as fluorescent labelling of biomolecules in biological and biochemical research. These dyes are known for their high sensitivity and photostability. Reference: NIH Link , Link",

      "question": "A woman presents with nodular lesions, 4-6 mm in size, on the inner thighs and peri-anal region.

        "D": "Donovanosis"
      },
      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "the presence of Henderson-Patterson bodies, is characteristic of Molluscum contagiosum . Henderson-Patterson bodies are eosinophilic inclusion bodies that are diagnostic for Molluscum contagiosum virus (MCV) infection. The virus primarily infects the skin, causing characteristic lesions that are typically described as pearl-like, dome-shaped, and umbilicated. The lesions are generally painless and self-limiting, though they can persist for months or even years. Molluscum Contagiosum: Caused by: Poxvirus (MCV-1 to MCV-4) MCV-1 is the most common. MCV-2 is often sexually transmitted. Common in: Children (2-12 years): Spread through direct contact or shared items (e.g., towels). Adults: Typically sexually transmitted, affecting genitals, lower abdomen, buttocks, and inner thighs. Incubation period: Approximately 6 weeks. Clinical Features: Pearly, dome-shaped papules with a dimpled centre. Papules are 1-5 mm in diameter. The central waxy core contains cytoplasmic viral inclusions. Common sites in children: Trunk, arms, and legs. Common sites in adults: Genitals, lower abdomen, buttocks, and inner thighs. Microscopic examination: Lesion Characteristics: Cup-like, verrucous epidermal hyperplasia. Diagnostic Structure : Molluscum body , a large (up to 35 µm), ellipsoid, homogeneous cytoplasmic inclusion. Found in the stratum granulosum and stratum corneum . Eosinophilic in the stratum granulosum. Pale blue hue in the stratum corneum. Trichodysplasia Spinulosa (Option A) is a viral infection that predominantly affects immunocompromised individuals, especially organ transplant recipients. It typically manifests as follicular papules and spiny nodules on the face, neck, and upper extremities. Histologically, it shows hyperkeratosis, follicular plugging, and hair shaft abnormalities. Condyloma acuminata (Option B) , or genital warts, is caused by the human papillomavirus (HPV) and is a sexually transmitted infection. These warts usually appear as flesh-coloured, cauliflower-like growths in the genital and perianal regions. Histologically, they are characterized by hyperkeratosis, acanthosis, and koilocytosis, where squamous cells exhibit a clear halo around the nucleus. Donovanosis (Option D), also called granuloma inguinale, is a bacterial infection caused by Klebsiella granulomatis . It presents as painless nodules or ulcers in the genital and perianal regions. Histologically, it shows granulomatous inflammation with Donovan bodies, which are large, rod-shaped, intracytoplasmic bacteria",

        "C": "Alcohol fixation",
        "D": "Glutaraldehyde fixation"
      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: B) Frozen section Explanation: Oil Red O stain is commonly used in frozen sections to detect the presence of lipids, particularly neutral lipids such as triglycerides. It is a lipophilic dye that selectively stains lipids within cells or tissues. It binds to the neutral lipid droplets and produces a bright red colour when examined under a microscope. This stain is particularly useful in identifying lipid accumulation in various tissues and organs, including adipose tissue, liver, muscle, and atherosclerotic plaques. Frozen sections are typically used for rapid intraoperative diagnosis or for research purposes. Formalin fixation (Option A) refers to the preservation of tissue samples using formaldehyde solutions, leading to the cross-linking of proteins and modification of lipid structures, which may interfere with the staining properties of Oil Red O. Alcohol fixation (Option C) involves the preservation of tissues using alcohol-based solutions, such as ethanol or methanol. It can also alter the structure of lipids, affecting the staining properties of Oil Red O. Glutaraldehyde fixation (Option D) is typically used for electron microscopy studies. It may lead to changes in lipid composition and affect the staining properties of Oil Red O.
