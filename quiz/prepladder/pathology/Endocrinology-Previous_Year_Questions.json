Papillary carcinoma is known for its characteristic nuclear changes, including nuclear grooves and pseudoinclusions. It usually has an excellent prognosis with a high survival rate. Incorrect Options: Option B - Follicular carcinoma: This type of thyroid cancer also presents as a thyroid nodule. However, it is less common than papillary carcinoma. Fine-needle aspiration biopsy alone might not be able to distinguish between follicular adenoma and follicular carcinoma. Histopathological examination of the tumor capsule and vascular invasion is required to make the distinction. Option C - Medullary carcinoma: Medullary carcinoma arises from parafollicular C cells and is associated with calcitonin production. It is typically not associated with microcalcifications on ultrasound and does not have the characteristic nuclear changes mentioned in the case. It's less common than papillary carcinoma and is often familial or associated with multiple endocrine neoplasia syndromes. Option D - Anaplastic carcinoma: This is an aggressive and rare type of thyroid cancer.

      "explanation": "Correct Answer: B) Papillary carcinoma Explanation: Papillary thyroid carcinoma, the most common thyroid cancer, is characterised by \"orphan Annie's eye\" nuclei, which appear empty with a pale, ground-glass appearance under microscopy. Papillary carcinoma thyroid: It is the most common type of thyroid cancer and is characterised by lymphatic spread. It often presents with a nodule in the anterior neck and lymphadenopathy. Associated with BRAF mutations and RET-PTC fusion. HPE shows True papillae: Fingerlike projections with fibrovascular core. Orphan Annie eye nuclei: Optically clear nucleus produced due to artefact. Intranuclear cytoplasmic inclusions (INCI). Nuclear groove or coffee bean nucleus. Presence of psammoma bodies: Dystrophic calcifications It has the best prognosis among thyroid malignancies. Follicular carcinoma (Option A) is a malignant thyroid tumour of follicular cells lacking papillary carcinomaâ€™s distinctive features. It typically affects older individuals and presents as a solitary thyroid mass or, less commonly, as bone metastases. It is more cellular, with a thick, irregular capsule, necrosis, and frequent mitotic activity. Toxic nodular goitre (Option C) , also known as Plummer disease or a toxic multi-nodular goitre (MNG), is characterised by a hormonally active and leads to hyperthyroidism. Treatment often includes radioactive iodine, which is absorbed by the thyroid and destroys hormone-producing cells, reducing or eliminating hormone production and potentially decreasing the size of the goitre. Medullary carcinoma (Option D) of the thyroid (MTC), a neuroendocrine tumour, originates from the C cells of the thyroid, which produce calcitonin. MTC accounts for less than 5% of all thyroid cancers. Unlike other thyroid cancers, MTC does not accumulate radioiodine but secretes calcitonin. Symptoms may include a",

      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: B) PIT1 Explanation: The features of long hands and feet, along with a protruding lower jaw, are characteristic of acromegaly , often caused by overproduction of growth hormone (GH). The gene most commonly implicated in this condition is PIT1 (Pituitary-specific gene), a transcription factor that regulates the development and function of pituitary cells responsible for GH production, particularly: Somatotrophs (Growth hormone-producing cells) Lactotrophs (Prolactin-producing cells) Thyrotrophs (TSH-producing cells). PIT1 is essential for the differentiation of specific pituitary cell types during embryonic development. Its mutations or dysregulation can lead to abnormal pituitary function, causing excess growth hormone production and acromegaly.

      },
      "correct_answer": "D",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: D) 6 follicular cell clusters containing 10-15 cells Explanation: For an adequate thyroid biopsy, the specimen should ideally contain at least 6 follicular cell clusters, each having 10-15 cells. Fine Needle Aspiration Cytology (FNAC) is a minimally invasive diagnostic procedure to evaluate abnormalities in various tissues, including thyroid nodules. Provides cytological details but not the Architecture. It is useful in papillary/medullary (amyloid)/anaplastic carcinomas, colloid nodules, and autoimmune or granulomatous thyroiditis. A 23G needle is used. Suspicious solitary/multiple nodules/ dominant nodules should be aspirated. A minimum of six aspirations should be done. An adequate FNAC smear should have six aspirations with six groups of cells, each containing 20 cells. USG-guided aspiration is better. Diagnostic accuracy of FNAC is 95%; sensitivity 85%; specificity 94%. Classification of FNAC reports: Thy 1 Non-diagnostic Thy 1c Non-diagnostic cystic Thy 2 Non-neoplastic Thy 3 Follicular Thy 4 Suspicion of malignancy Thy 5 Malignant Limitations of FNAC: Follicular Neoplasms: FNAC cannot differentiate between follicular adenoma and follicular carcinoma because it does not provide information about the capsule or vascular invasion . A further biopsy is needed for a definitive diagnosis. Riedelâ€™s Thyroiditis: In this, the thyroid gland is replaced by fibrous tissue, which can result in a poor yield of cells, reducing the effectiveness of FNAC. Thyroid Lymphoma: FNAC may not provide sufficient information to diagnose thyroid lymphoma accurately. A biopsy is required to obtain tissue samples for specific markers and a more comprehensive diagnosis.

        "D": "Medullary carcinoma of thyroid"
      },
      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: A) Hashimoto thyroiditis Explanation: The clinical scenario with thyroid swelling and elevated TSH levels & presence of thyroid peroxidase antibodies along with the presence of hurthle cells points towards Hashimoto thyroiditis. Hashimoto thyroiditis: An autoimmune disorder that causes chronic inflammation of the thyroid gland. It is the most common cause of hypothyroidism. The characteristic features include elevated TSH levels (due to thyroid failure) and the presence of thyroid peroxidase (TPO) antibodies , which attack the thyroid tissue. It is the most common cause of hypothyroidism in iodine-sufficient areas. It is characterised by painless enlargement of the thyroid, commonly in middle-aged women. The enlargement of the gland is generally symmetric and diffuse. In histopathology, there is extensive lymphocytic infiltration with well-developed germinal centres. The thyroid follicles are atrophic and are lined in many areas by epithelial cells with abundant eosinophilic, granular cytoplasm, termed HÃ¼rthle cells, that represent a metaplastic response of the normally low cuboidal follicular epithelium to chronic injury. The thyroid parenchyma contains a dense lymphocytic infiltrate with germinal centres. Graves' disease (Option B) is an autoimmune disorder leading to hyperthyroidism, characterised by low TSH levels and the presence of thyroid-stimulating immunoglobulins (TSI), not thyroid peroxidase antibodies. Hurthle cells are not a feature of Gravesâ€™ disease. Follicular carcinoma of the thyroid (Option C) is a malignant tumour of the thyroid, usually presenting with a solitary nodule and not typically associated with Hurthle cells or elevated TSH levels. Histopathologically, it features follicular cells arranged in a follicular pattern , with capsular and vascular invasion . Medullary carcinoma of the thyroid (Option D) is a neuroendocrine cancer arising from the C-cells of the thyroid, and it is associated with elevated calcitonin levels. Histopathologically, it features polygonal or spindle-shaped cells arranged in nests or follicles , with amyloid deposits often present.",
