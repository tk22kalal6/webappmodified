      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: C) Bethesda System Explanation: The Bethesda System for Reporting Thyroid Cytopathology (TBSRTC) is a standardised reporting system designed to classify thyroid Fine-Needle Aspiration Cytology (FNAC) biopsy results. The system includes six diagnostic categories, ranging from non-diagnostic/unsatisfactory to malignant. The Bethesda System for Reporting Thyroid Cytopathology Diagnostic category Risk of malignancy (%) Usual management Non-diagnostic 5-20 Repeat FNAC with ultrasound guidance Benign 2-7 Clinical and sonographic follow-up Atypia of undetermined significance 13-30 Repeat FNAC, molecular testing, diagnostic lobectomy, or surveillance Follicular neoplasm 23-34 Molecular testing, diagnostic lobectomy Suspicious for malignancy 67-83 Molecular testing, lobectomy, or near-total thyroidectomy Malignant 97-100 Lobectomy or near-total thyroidectomy The Bethesda system is also used to report cervical cytology. TIRADS (Thyroid Imaging Reporting and Data System) (Option A) is a classification system for reporting thyroid ultrasound findings, not cytopathology. Gleason’s System (Option B) is used to grade prostate cancer based on histological patterns. Duke Classification (Option D) is a system for staging colorectal cancer.

      "question": "You are examining a high-resolution microscopic image of thyroid tissue. Which of the following depicts cells responsible for the secretion of calcitonin?",

      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: B) B Explanation: Parafollicular cells responsible for calcitonin secretion are indicated by ‘B’ in the given image. C-cells secrete the hormone calcitonin (Hypocalcemic Hormone). C-cells (Parafollicular Cells) cells are columnar with basally located nuclei. Follicular Cells (Option A) have a round nucleus and basophilic cytoplasm. Their function is to synthesize thyroid hormones. Colloid (Option C) is a gel-like substance that appears pinkish and homogeneous in the follicles and serves as a reservoir for thyroid hormones. Stromal Cells (Option D) fill up spaces between the follicles and connective tissue, capillaries, and lymphatics. Reference: Victor P. Eroschenko - Atlas of Histology with Functional Correlations, 13th Edition, Page 771.",

      "correct_answer": "D",
      "explanation": "common cause of hypothyroidism in iodine-sufficient areas. It is characterised by painless enlargement of the thyroid, commonly in middle-aged women. The enlargement of the gland is generally symmetric and diffuse. In histopathology, there is extensive lymphocytic infiltration with well-developed germinal centres. The thyroid follicles are atrophic and are lined in many areas by epithelial cells with abundant eosinophilic, granular cytoplasm, termed Hürthle cells. Hürthle cells represent a metaplastic response of the normally low cuboidal follicular epithelium to chronic injury. The thyroid parenchyma contains a dense lymphocytic infiltrate with germinal centres.",

        "D": "Anti-thyroid hormone antibodies (Anti-T3/T4)"
      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Correct answer: B) Anti-thyroid peroxidase antibodies (Anti-TPO) Explanation: In Hashimoto's thyroiditis, the immune system mistakenly targets the thyroid gland, leading to chronic inflammation and damage. Antibodies play a crucial role in this process. Anti-Thyroid Peroxidase (TPO) Antibodies : Target an enzyme called thyroid peroxidase, which helps synthesise thyroid hormones. They are a hallmark of Hashimoto's thyroiditis and are frequently elevated in affected individuals. Anti-Thyroglobulin(Tg) Antibodies : Thyroglobulin is a protein involved in thyroid hormone production. Antibodies against thyroglobulin can disrupt hormone synthesis and contribute to thyroid gland damage. Thyroid-stimulating immunoglobulins (TSI) are found in Graves' disease. (Option A) Anti-thyroid stimulating hormone receptor antibodies (Anti-TSHR): These antibodies are typically associated with autoimmune thyroid diseases such as Graves' disease.

      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "Correct answer: A) TSH receptor Explanation: The HPE image shows features of Grave’s disease most commonly as Long-acting thyroid stimulator antibodies that target the TSH receptor. The HPE image shows the microscopic finding of Graves disease, characterised by Follicles are lined by hyperplastic, enlarged epithelial cells that project into the lumens of the follicles, forming papillary projections. These are called Pseudopapillae (vs true papillae containing a fibrovascular core). These cells actively resorb the colloid in the centres of the follicles, resulting in the scalloped appearance of the colloid's edges. Antibodies in Graves disease: TSI - Thyroid stimulating immunoglobulin or LATS - Long-acting thyroid stimulator. These antibodies attach to the TSH receptor and stimulate them, leading to excessive release of T3 and T4. This results in hyperthyroidism",

      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "Correct answer: A) Increased activity of orbital fibroblasts Explanation: This patient with hyperthyroidism (weight loss, palpitations, tachycardia) and significant ophthalmopathy (proptosis, diplopia) has Graves disease with ophthalmopathy, which is due to increased activity of orbital fibroblasts. Graves disease is an autoimmune disorder triggered by thyrotropin receptor antibodies that activate the TSH receptor. The TSH receptor is also on fibroblasts, adipocytes, and other cell types.

      },
      "correct_answer": "D",
      "explanation": "Correct answer: D) Stony and hard consistency. Explanation: Riedel's Thyroiditis belongs to an IgG4-related disease that causes extensive fibrosis. Fibrosis causes the thyroid to become stony and hard. It also attaches the thyroid to the adjacent tissues, muscles, and vessels implying the mass is fixed and does not move with deglutition. So it behaves like/mimics a cancer. Other IgG4-related diseases include: Mikulicz syndrome- Affects salivary and lacrimal gland Kuttner syndrome- Sclerosis of the submandibular gland Ormond disease- Idiopathic retroperitoneal fibrosis Angiocentric fibrosis- Involves nasal cavity Reference: Robbins and Cotran Pathologic basis of disease, 10th Edition, Page 1081",

      "explanation": "Correct Answer: B) A-CAL Explanation: The given scenario and mutation are associated with medullary thyroid carcinoma, which has amyloid deposition derived from calcitonin, known as A-CAL. Medullary carcinoma of the thyroid is a neuroendocrine tumour arising from parafollicular C cells. They secrete calcitonin, which regulates calcium levels and is also a marker for diagnosis and postoperative follow-up. Carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) is a marker in which calcitonin is negative. They can be sporadic or associated with familial syndromes like MEN 2. Both have associated RET mutations. Sporadic tumours usually present with solitary nodules whereas familial ones are characterised by bilaterality and multicentricity, and can have features of other associated tumours. A biopsy would show amyloid deposits (Acal) derived from calcitonin polypeptides. A- β ( Option A) : It is associated with Alzheimer's disease. A-L (Option C) : Is associated with primary amyloidosis and multiple myeloma, derived from immunoglobulin light chains. A-TTR ( Option D) : It is associated with transthyretin and is seen in conditions like familial amyloid polyneuropathy and senile systemic amyloidosis.
