Age: 40 years or older Sex: Higher predominance in males The clear cell and mesenchymal variants occur in younger people in their teens or 20s. Chondrosarcomas commonly arise in the axial skeleton, especially the pelvis, shoulder, and ribs. The popcorn/honey comb matrix is a finding in chondrosarcoma, characterized by irregular calcifications within the cartilage matrix. Histologically, they are classified into 4 types. Conventional (Option 1) Dedifferentiated (Option 4) Neoplastic cartilage infiltrates the marrow space and surrounds the pre-existing bony trabeculae. Low-grade chondrosarcoma with a second, high-grade component that does not produce cartilage. Clear-cell (Option 3) Mesenchymal (Option 2) It contains sheets of large, malignant chondrocytes with abundant clear cytoplasm, numerous osteoclast-type giant cells, and intralesional bone formation.

Bone marrow is highly vascularised and innervated , providing the necessary microenvironment for hematopoiesis and immune function. 2. Osteoblasts are responsible for bone formation, while osteoclasts are involved in bone resorption. Osteoblasts are bone-forming cells , while osteoclasts are responsible for bone resorption , leading to bone remodelling and maintenance of bone density. Incorrect statements: Statement Correct Explanation 3. Hematopoietic stem cells in the bone marrow give rise to some cell lineages Hematopoietic stem cells give rise to all blood cell lineages , not just some. 4. Bone marrow lacks hematopoietic elements and serves primarily as a site for fat storage. Bone marrow is a major site for hematopoiesis , where blood cells are produced. While some bone marrow does contain adipocytes for fat storage , this is not its primary function. 5. Bone remodelling is solely regulated by mechanical stress and does not involve hormonal regulation. Mechanical stress and hormonal factors, both regulate bone remodelling, including parathyroid hormone (PTH) and calcitonin.

Giant cell tumour (Osteoclastoma): It is a benign but locally aggressive tumour characterised by numerous multinucleated osteoclast-type giant cells. It occurs in the third to fifth decades of life. Pathogenesis: The neoplastic cells are primitive osteoblast precursors that express high levels of RANKL, promoting the proliferation of osteoclast precursors and their differentiation into mature osteoclasts. This increased activity of osteoclasts is responsible for the tumour being highly lytic and expansile due to uncontrolled bone resorption. Giant cell tumours develop within the epiphysis and may extend into the metaphysis. Mostly located near the knee, involving the distal femur or proximal tibia. Although rare, they can metastasize to the lungs , but typically regress spontaneously and are rarely fatal. Morphology: Grossly, the tumours are large , red-brown masses that frequently undergo cystic degeneration. Histologically, the tumours consist of uniform oval mononuclear tumour cells and abundant osteoclast-type giant cells with 100 or more nuclei.",

About 85% of osteochondromas are solitary and sporadic , with the remainder as part of autosomal dominant multiple hereditary exostosis syndrome. Males are affected three times more often than females. The most common site is the metaphysis near the growth plate of long tubular bones (knee > pelvis > scapula > ribs), where they tend to have short stalks. Hereditary exostoses are associated with germline loss-of-function mutations in the EXT1 or EXT2 gene, which encode glycosyltransferases involved in heparan sulfate synthesis. Morphology: It is a sessile or pedunculated tumour in bones of endochondral origin. Hyaline cartilage cap surrounded by pericondrium.

      "question": "A 15-year-old male presents with persistent knee pain and swelling of two months duration. The pain is severe at night and not relieved by NSAIDs. A biopsy was performed, and it showed pleomorphism, large hyperchromatic nuclei, and bizarre giant cells producing unmineralised osteoid. What is the most likely diagnosis?",

        "A": "Osteoid osteoma",

      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "osteosarcoma, characterised by presence of pleomorphism, large hyperchromatic nuclei, and bizarre giant cells producing unmineralised osteoid Osteosarcoma : It is the most common primary malignant tumour of bone and accounts for approximately 20% of bone cancers. Age distribution: Bimodal. 75% of cases - before 20 years of age. Slight rise of incidence in older adults with Paget disease, bone infarcts & prior radiation. Tumours usually arise in the metaphyseal region of the long bones; almost 50% are near the knee in the distal femur or proximal tibia. Genetic associations: RB gene (most common): 70%. TP53. CDKN2A (also known as INK4a). MDM2 and CDK4. Morphology: Osteosarcomas are bulky, gritty, grey-white tumours that often contain haemorrhage and cystic degeneration. Histology demonstrate pleomorphism , large hyperchromatic nuclei , bizarre tumour giant cells , and abundant mitoses. Extensive necrosis and intravascular invasion are also common. Diagnosis of osteosarcoma requires the presence of malignant tumour cells producing unmineralised osteoid or mineralised bone. Osteosarcoma metastasises hematogenously to the lungs, bones, brain, and other sites.",

        "A": "It has a predilection for the appendicular skeleton.",

      "explanation": "imaging shows a small, well-defined bone tumor, and the clinical presentation is consistent with osteoid osteoma , which is characterized by nocturnal pain. These are rarely found in the axial skeleton , with a much higher predilection for the appendicular skeleton (limbs).

Osteopetrosis/Marble bone disease: Osteopetrosis is a group of rare genetic diseases characterised by reduced bone resorption due to deficient osteoclast development or function , leading to impaired bone remodelling and dense but brittle bones prone to fractures. The inheritance patterns are as follows: Autosomal dominant (Alberg-Schonberg disease) : CLCN7. Autosomal recessive: TCIRG1 and Carbonic anhydrase 2 (CA2). X-linked: IKBKG. Morphologically, affected bones lack a medullary canal , exhibit bulbous and misshapen ends , and show persistent primary spongiosa.
