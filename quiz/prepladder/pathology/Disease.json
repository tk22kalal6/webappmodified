      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: B) Peripheral tolerance Explanation: The clinical scenario likely describes IPEX (immune dysregulation, polyendocrinopathy, enteropathy, X-linked) due to defective peripheral tolerance. IPEX is an X-linked immune dysregulation disorder that presents in childhood. It occurs due to defects in the FOXP3 gene, which plays a crucial role in peripheral tolerance mediated by CD4+ T regulatory cells. Defects in FOXP3 lead to dysfunctional CD4+ T regulatory cells, impairing their ability to maintain immune tolerance and resulting in autoimmune reactions against various tissues, particularly within the gastrointestinal tract. It has a classic triad of: Enteropathy (chronic diarrhoea due to intestinal inflammation) Polyendocrinopathy (m/c - Type I DM and thyroiditis) Dermatitis (eczematous) Defective central tolerance (Option A) may cause autoimmune polyendocrine syndrome (APS) due to a mutation in the AIRE gene, which is characterized by chronic mucocutaneous candidiasis, abnormalities of skin, dental enamel, and nails (ectodermal dystrophy), autoimmune adrenalitis, autoimmune hypoparathyroidism, idiopathic hypogonadism, pernicious anaemia. Anergy (Option C) is a tolerance mechanism in which lymphocytes are intrinsically functionally inactivated following an antigen encounter. Induction of anergy can be helpful in the treatment of autoimmune diseases and allergies. It has no role in IPEX. Hidden (Option D) antigen refers to antigens from sites not accessed by the body’s regular immune system. These include the brain (separated by the blood-brain barrier), the testes, and the eye. Disruption of these barriers can result in respective organ dysfunction.

      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "Correct answer: A): 1-c, 2-a, 3-d, 4-b. Explanation: Negative selection or clonal deletion : Process in which T cells expressing receptors for self-antigens encounter these antigens in the thymus and are then killed by apoptosis. AIRE (autoimmune regulator) is a regulator protein critical for deleting these T cells. A defect in AIRE leads to autoimmune polyendocrine syndrome. Anergy : A process where lymphocytes that recognise self-antigens are rendered functionally unresponsive. Binding co-stimulatory signals to CD28 leads to T cell proliferation and differentiation. CTLA-4 is an inhibitory receptor on T cells that prevents CD28-mediated costimulation of T cells. Deletion by apoptosis : T cells that recognise self-antigens receive signals that promote their death by apoptosis. Upon recognition of self-antigens, lymphocytes express the death receptor Fas (CD95) . Mutations in Fas or FasL result in autoimmune lymphoproliferative syndrome (ALPS) Suppression by regulatory T cells : CD4+/ regulatory T cells prevent immune reactions against self-antigens. Both IL-2 and FOXP3 are required for the functioning of CD4+ regulatory T cells. Mutations in FOXP3 result in an autoimmune disease called IPEX (immune dysregulation, polyendocrinopathy, enteropathy, X-linked ).

The testis, eye, and brain are called immune-privileged sites because antigens are sequestered from the immune system without communicating with blood and lymph. Brain Blood-brain barrier Eyes Blood-ocular barrier Testes Blood-testicular barrier These tissues fail to elicit immune responses and are ignored by the immune system. If the antigens of these tissues are released as a consequence of trauma or infection, an immune response will result, leading to prolonged inflammation and injury.

SLE is a chronic autoimmune disease with the production of many antibodies like antinuclear antibodies (ANAs), anti-double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) and anti-Smith (Sm) These autoantibodies form immune complexes that deposit in tissues, causing inflammation and damage. It is more common in women. Clinical Manifestations of SLE: Skin: Malar rash (butterfly rash), photosensitivity, discoid lesions, and mucosal ulcers. Joints: Non-erosive arthritis commonly affects the hands, wrists, and knees. Renal: Lupus nephritis ranging from asymptomatic proteinuria to severe kidney failure. The major cause of morbidity and mortality in SLE. Cardiovascular: Pericarditis, myocarditis, increased risk of atherosclerosis and coronary artery disease. Pulmonary: Pleurisy and pleural effusion, pulmonary hypertension and interstitial lung. Neurologic: Neuropsychiatric symptoms ranging from headaches and cognitive dysfunction to seizures and psychosis. Hematologic: Anemia, leukopenia, and thrombocytopenia. The risk of thrombotic events is increased. Dermatomyositis (Option A) can present with skin rash, muscle weakness, and occasionally joint pain, but it typically lacks the malar rash seen in SLE.

      "explanation": "Correct Answer: B) Anti-Sm, ANA Explanation: Based on the above clinical scenario, the most likely diagnosis is systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). Antinuclear antibodies (ANA) are the hallmark of the disease. Positive ANA is seen in >97% of cases of SLE. However, it has low specificity and is seen in healthy individuals and many other diseases. Anti-Smith(Sm) antibodies are seen in less than 30% of SLE patients but have 99% specificity for SLE. Anti-double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) antibodies have more than 95% specificity.

      },
      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: A) Primary Raynaud phenomenon Explanation: The given clinical scenario describes the Raynaud phenomenon (an exaggerated vasoconstriction of arteries and arterioles in response to cold or emotional stress. The fingers classically show red, white, and blue colour changes from most proximal to most distal, correlating with proximal vasodilation, central vasoconstriction, and more distal cyanosis. Untreated RP may result in ulceration and, in severe cases, autoamputation. Primary Raynaud's phenomenon is characterized by symmetric episodes of finger whitening induced by cold, resulting from hyper reactive smooth muscle cells in the blood vessel walls. It occurs without an underlying disorder and typically does not lead to ulcers. Tests for autoimmune conditions yield negative results in such cases. Secondary Raynaud's phenomenon results from underlying arterial disease seen in autoimmune disorders like mixed connective tissue disease, CREST syndrome, and SLE. It shows asymmetric finger involvement and progressive worsening of symptoms over time. (Option C) Dermatomyositis (Option B) may involve the hands, with classical lesions being Gottron papules (multiple hyperkeratotic, flat, red papules over the dorsum of the metacarpophalangeal joints) and mechanic hands (fissuring with hyperkeratotic papules, scaling, and fissures along the sides of the fingers and palms).

      "correct_answer": "D",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: D) Systemic sclerosis Explanation: The patient's presentation and echo showing pulmonary hypertension are highly suggestive of systemic sclerosis, also known as scleroderma. Scleroderma, also known as systemic sclerosis, is a rare autoimmune disease characterized by excessive collagen production, which leads to thickening and hardening of the skin and other organs. It is predominantly seen in females and has a peak incidence in the 50-60 age group. Localized scleroderma primarily affects the skin, typically confined to areas such as the fingers, forearms, and face, while systemic sclerosis involves both skin and internal organs. Subtypes In systemic sclerosis: Limited systemic sclerosis (CREST syndrome) features calcinosis, Raynaud phenomenon, oesophagal dysmotility, sclerodactyly, and telangiectasia. It is characterized by a positive anti-centromere antibody (option C) Diffuse systemic sclerosis (scleroderma) features widespread skin thickening starting from fingers, positive Anti-SCL-70 antibody, and extensive organ involvement: GIT dysfunction, musculoskeletal inflammation, scleroderma renal crisis, interstitial lung fibrosis, pulmonary hypertension, and cardiac manifestations. Rheumatoid arthritis (Option A) : This condition is characterized by symmetrical joint pain and swelling and is distinguished by the presence of rheumatoid factor and anti-cyclic citrullinated peptide. Osteoarthritis (Option B) is a degenerative joint disease affecting weight-bearing joints without skin involvement or autoimmune features.

      "explanation": "Correct Answer: D) Polymyositis Explanation The features of progressive proximal muscle weakness along with the findings of endomysial inflammation on biopsy suggest the diagnosis of polymyositis. Polymyositis: Polymyositis is an adult-onset inflammatory myopathy. Pathogenesis: Unknown, but it is believed to have an immunologic basis. CD8+ cytotoxic T cells are the mediators of tissue damage. Endomysial inflammation is seen and no atrophy. Dermatomyositis (Option A) also presents with proximal muscle weakness and elevated CK levels, but it typically includes skin manifestations (e.g., heliotrope rash, Gottron's papules), which are not mentioned here. Muscle biopsy in dermatomyositis typically shows perifascicular atrophy with CD4+ T cells, rather than the endomysial inflammation and CD8+ T cells seen in polymyositis. Myasthenia Gravis (Option B) commonly presents with fluctuating muscle weakness that worsens with activity and typically involves ocular muscles (ptosis, diplopia) early on, which are not described here.
