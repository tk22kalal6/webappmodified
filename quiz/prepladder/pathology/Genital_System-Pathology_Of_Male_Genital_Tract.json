Pathological features correlating with malignancy include large size, necrosis, infiltrative borders, anaplasia, mitotic activity, vascular-lymphatic invasion, and extratesticular extension. Leydig cell tumour Sertoli cell tumour Hormonal involvement It often involves androgens, oestrogens, and corticosteroids. Hormonally silent. Conditions associated with Klinefelter syndrome. Cryptorchidism. Renal cell carcinoma. Carney complex. Peutz-Jeghers syndrome. Familial adenomatous polyposis. Malignancy 10% (in adults) 10% Gross Circumscribed nodules, usually < 5 cm in diameter. They have a distinctive golden brown, homogeneous appearance on cut surfaces. Firm, small nodules with a homogeneous grey-white to yellow cut surface. Histology The tumour cells resemble their normal counterparts. They are large in size and have round or polygonal cell outlines , abundant granular eosinophilic cytoplasm , and a round central nucleus. The cytoplasm frequently contains lipid droplets , vacuoles , or lipofuscin pigment and, most characteristically, rod-shaped Reinke crystalloids (25% of the tumours). The tumour cells are arranged in distinctive trabeculae that tend to form cord-like structures and tubules. Image",

      "explanation": "Correct answer : B) Prostate Adenocarcinoma The case scenario describes a 60-year-old male with urinary symptoms and a palpable nodule on digital rectal examination, suggestive of prostate pathology. The histological features as seen include prominent nucleoli, perineural invasion, and an infiltrative growth pattern , which are characteristic of prostate adenocarcinoma. Features of Prostate Cancer: Prostate cancer cells form irregular glandular structures that may vary in size and shape. Glands may be crowded and back-to-back , lacking the normal orderly appearance seen in benign glands. Cells exhibit enlarged, hyperchromatic nuclei with prominent nucleoli. Perineural invasion is a common feature of prostate cancer and may indicate a higher risk of disease progression. Cancer cells infiltrate the surrounding tissues in an irregular, invasive manner. Immunohistochemical staining can be used to identify specific markers associated with prostate cancer, such as prostate-specific antigen (PSA), prostate-specific acid phosphatase (PSAP), androgen receptor (AR), and cytokeratins.

It usually occurs as an isolated anomaly but may be accompanied by other genitourinary tract malformations, such as hypospadias. (Option A) The normal descent of the testes occurs in two phases: Transabdominal phase: Mediated by Mullerian inhibiting substance. Inguinoscrotal phase: Mediated by the androgen-induced release of calcitonin-related gene peptide. Sites of arrest of descent: Inguinal canal (most common). (Option B) Abdomen (uncommon). Morphology: Gross: The testis is small, brown, and atrophic. Microscopic: Atrophic tubules with thickened basement membrane. The subsequent loss of spermatogonia leaves the tubules with only Sertoli cells. The Leydig cells are spared and appear relatively prominent. (Option D) Management: During the first year of life, most inguinal cryptorchid testes descend spontaneously into the scrotum. If it remains undescended, surgical correction by orchiopexy (placement in the scrotal sac) is required, preferably before the development of histologic changes (to be performed at 6-12 months).
