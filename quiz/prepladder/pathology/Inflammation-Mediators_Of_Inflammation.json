        "D": "Prostaglandin (PG) F2 inhibition"
      },
      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: C) Cycloxygenase (COX) 1 and COX-2 inhibition Explanation: Arachidonic acid (AA), derived from phospholipids, is metabolized by cyclooxygenases (COX-1, COX-2) to form prostanoids (prostaglandins, thromboxane). COX-1 is a constitutive enzyme, predominantly involved in various homeostatic mechanisms in the body, while COX-2 is predominantly involved in inflammation. Prostaglandins are responsible for vasodilation (PGD2, PGI2) and pain (PGE2) in inflammation. Naproxen is a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID). The predominant action of NSAIDs is via COX-1 and COX-2 inhibition, resulting in analgesia and anti-inflammatory effects which is required in this case of musculoskeletal injury.. One major adverse effect of NSAIDs is gastric irritation, including ulcers and bleeding. This occurs due to the loss of gastroprotective PGs i.e. PGE2 formed by COX-1. Thus, in patients with previous history of gastric ulcers, selective COX-2 inhibitors may be used - celecoxib, etoricoxib, etc. Lipoxygenase acts on AA to form leukotrienes. Leukotrienes have clinical significance in atopy and mediate anaphylaxis and bronchoconstriction. Zileuton (LOX inhibitor) and montelukast (LT receptor antagonists) are therefore used in asthma and allergic rhinitis but have no anti-inflammatory action (Option A). PGF2 is a prostanoid formed by cyclooxygenase. However, it has no role in inflammation. Rather, it causes smooth muscle contraction. Thus PGF2alpha analogue (carboprost) may be used to induce labor or as an abortifacient (Option D) Reference: Robbins and Cotran, Pathologic Basis of Disease, 10th edition, Page 98",

      "explanation": "CORRECT ANSWER: D) 3,4 EXPLANATION: The correct statements regarding the complement system are statements 3 and 4. Complement System: The complement system is a collection of plasma proteins that function mainly in host defense against microbes and in pathologic inflammatory reactions. The system consists of more than 20 proteins, some of which are numbered C1 through C9. The complement proteins function in both innate and adaptive immunity for defense against microbial pathogens. (Statement 1) Site of synthesis: (Statement 2) Liver (major site). Monocytes. Tissue macrophages. Epithelial cells of GIT and genitourinary tract. Activation of complement proteins occurs by three pathways: (Statement 4) Classical pathway. Alternative pathway. Lectin pathway. Activation of complement pathway: All complement proteins are synthesized in inactive forms and are activated by proteolysis. (Statement 3) Complements have two unequal fragments (small and large fragments). (Statement 5) The larger fragments are designated as ‘b’ (e.g., C3b), and the smaller fragments are designated as ‘a' (e.g., C3a) ( exception: C2a —larger fragment). The larger fragment participates in the complement pathway's cascade reaction , and the smaller fragment diffuses away to mediate other functions.

      "explanation": "CORRECT ANSWER: C) Cleavage of C3 into C3a and C3b EXPLANATION: Complement system is a plasma derived mediator of inflammation. Other plasma derived mediators of inflammation are Coagulation/Cloting and Kinin pathway. The complement system can be activated by three pathways: Classical pathway Triggered by the binding of C1 to an antibody (IgM or IgG) that has combined with the antigen. Activated by Ag-Ab complex. Alternate pathway Triggered by microbial surface molecules (e.g., endotoxin or lipopolysaccharide [LPS]), complex polysaccharides, cobra venom, and other substances in the absence of an antibody. Lectin pathway The plasma mannose-binding lectin binds to carbohydrates on microbes and directly activates C1. The cleavage of C3 into its active fragments, C3a and C3b , is the critical event in the complement system and serves as a central step in all three complement activation pathways.

      },
      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "CORRECT ANSWER: C) Deficiency of C1 esterase inhibitor EXPLANATION: The clinical presentation of the patient with sudden-onset swelling of her face, lips, and tongue with similar episodes in the past, triggered by stress and trauma is suggestive of hereditary angioneurotic edema. It is caused due to deficiency of C1 esterase inhibitor Hereditary angioneurotic edema is a rare autosomal dominant disorder characterized by recurrent episodes of non-pitting, non-pruritic swelling of the skin and mucous membranes. C1INH (C1 esterase inhibitor) blocks the catalytic function of C1. Deficiency of C1 esterase inhibitor leads to elevated plasma levels of bradykinin leading to angioedema, and excessive activation of C1 results in a decline in plasma C4 and C2 levels. Swelling in HAE commonly affects areas such as the face, lips, tongue, throat, and extremities and can lead to airway compromise if it involves the upper respiratory tract. Triggers for HAE episodes can vary but commonly include stress, trauma, hormonal fluctuations (e.g., menstruation), and certain medications (e.g., estrogen-containing contraceptives) Complement deficiency Pathway(s) involved Disease (pathology) Properdin (Option A) Alternative pathway Increased susceptibility to encapsulated organisms (Neisseria) C1, C2, C3, C4 (Option B) C1, C2, C4- Classical pathway C3- Common pathway SLE, glomerulonephritis, pyogenic infections C5-C9: Membrane attack complex (Option D) Common deficiency Disseminated Neisseria infection( gram negative bacteria) Reference: Harrison’s Principles of Internal Medicine, 21st edition, Page no. 2723 Essentials of Medical Microbiology, Apurba S Sastry, 3rd edition, Page no. 168 Robbins and Cotran, Pathologic Basis of Disease, 10th edition, Page no. 90-92",

        "D": "Factor H"
      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "CORRECT ANSWER: B) CD59 EXPLANATION: A clinical presentation of a patient with hemoglobinuria, pallor, jaundice, anemia, elevated LDH, and flow cytometry showing deficiency of certain proteins on the surface of red blood cells would be suggestive of paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH), which is due to the deficiency of CD59. PNH is a rare acquired hematologic disorder characterized by a mutation of the PIG-A gene . This mutation results in a deficiency of glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI)- anchored proteins on the surface of blood cells. This deficiency leads to the absence of important complement regulatory proteins, such as CD55 aka DAF (decay accelerating factor) and CD59 aka RIML (reactive inhibitor of membrane lysis) , which normally protect red blood cells from complement-mediated destruction. Consequently, red blood cells become sensitive to lysis by the complement system , particularly during periods of physical stress or following sleep. PNH is characterized by a triad of hemolysis + pancytopenia + venous thrombosis. Other symptoms include hemoglobinuria, fatigue, pallor, jaundice, abdominal pain, and recurrent infections. Flow cytometry (the gold standard for diagnosis): Shows the absence of CD55 and CD59. Factor H (Option D): Complement Factor H is a circulating glycoprotein that inhibits the alternative pathway by promoting the cleavage and destruction of C3b and the turnover of the C3 convertases. Factor H deficiency is associated with an atypical form of hemolytic uremic syndrome and age-related macular degeneration.

        "C": "Interleukin-1",
        "D": "Bradykinin"
      },
      "correct_answer": "D",
      "explanation": "CORRECT ANSWER: D) Bradykinin EXPLANATION: Bradykinin mediates pain during an inflammatory response Bradykinin is produced from the cleavage of high-molecular-weight kininogen by the action of kallikrein. It is a potent mediator of inflammation and pain , released in response to tissue injury and trauma . It acts on its receptors to induce vasodilation , increase vascular permeability , and stimulate the release of other inflammatory mediators. These actions contribute to the characteristic signs of inflammation, including redness, swelling, heat, and pain. Additionally, bradykinin can directly activate nociceptors (pain-sensing neurons), leading to the sensation of pain. The action of bradykinin is short-lived because it is quickly inactivated by an enzyme called kininase. Bradykinin has been implicated as a mediator in some forms of allergic reactions, such as anaphylaxis. (Serotonin) (Option A) Serotonin, also known as 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) , is a neurotransmitter and vasoactive substance produced primarily by enterochromaffin cells in the gastrointestinal tract. It regulates mood, appetite , and sleep , as well as gastrointestinal motility and platelet aggregation . In the context of inflammation, serotonin released from platelets and mast cells can contribute to vasodilation , increased vascular permeability, and smooth muscle contraction . Its role in inflammation is less prominent compared to other mediators like histamine and bradykinin. (Leukotrienes) (Option B) Leukotrienes are lipid mediators synthesized from arachidonic acid metabolism, primarily by the 5-lipoxygenase pathway. They play a significant role in the pathogenesis of asthma and allergic reactions by inducing bronchoconstriction, increasing vascular permeability , and promoting the recruitment of inflammatory cells to the site of inflammation. (Interleukin-1) (Option C) Interleukin-1 (IL-1) is a proinflammatory cytokine produced by various cells, including macrophages, monocytes , and dendritic cells , in response to infection, injury, or inflammation. It plays a central role in the inflammatory response by inducing fever, activating immune cells , and promoting the production of other cytokines and inflammatory mediators. However, IL-1 is not a primary mediator responsible for the localized symptoms described in the clinical scenario, including pain, swelling, erythema, and warmth following a traumatic injury.
