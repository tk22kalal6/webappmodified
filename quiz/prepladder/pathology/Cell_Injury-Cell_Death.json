      "explanation": "Correct answer: C) It causes a wedge-shaped necrosis in the affected organs Explanation: Coagulative Necrosis: Most common type of necrosis. Seen in solid organs like the kidney, liver, and heart (Option A) . (Brain and Pancreas show liquefactive necrosis) Grossly, wedge-shaped necrosis is seen. Tissue architecture is preserved. Microscopically, ghost cells are seen. These show preserved outlines but details are lost. Sheets of ghost cells are known to form tombstone appearance. The tissue architecture is preserved despite cell death (As there is no proteolysis due to denaturation of enzymes along with structural proteins), making it a hallmark of coagulative necrosis.",

      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "(DAMPs). Correct answer: B) Inflammatory response and release of damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs). Explanation: Apoptosis is a non-inflammatory , programmed cell death process. It does not release DAMPs in a way that triggers a strong inflammatory response, unlike necrosis , which does cause inflammation and DAMP release. Apoptosis (Caspase dependent programmed cell death): It is an active process. It eliminates cells that are injured beyond repair without eliciting a host reaction, thus limiting collateral tissue damage. Apoptosis results from the activation of enzymes called caspases leading to DNA fragmentation. The process of apoptosis may be divided into an initiation phase , during which caspases9 (intrinsic pathway), 8,10 (extrinsic pathway) become catalytically active and unleash a cascade of other caspases, and an execution phase , during which the terminal caspases 3,6,7 trigger cellular fragmentation. Morphological features: Cell shrinkage Chromatin condensation Formation of cytoplasmic blebs and apoptotic bodies Phagocytosis of apoptotic bodies, usually by macrophages. Histopathology: In H&E-stained tissue, the apoptotic cell appears as a round or oval mass of intensely eosinophilic cytoplasm with fragments of dense nuclear chromatin.",

      "explanation": "Correct answer: B) Cyt C and Apaf Explanation : The apoptosome is a multi-protein complex that plays a critical role in the intrinsic (mitochondrial) pathway of apoptosis . It is formed when cytochrome c (Cyt C) is released from mitochondria into the cytosol in response to cellular stress or damage. Once in the cytosol: Cytochrome c binds to Apaf-1 (apoptotic protease activating factor-1) in the presence of dATP/ATP This triggers the formation of the apoptosome complex The apoptosome then recruits and activates procaspase-9 , which leads to activation of downstream executioner caspases (3, 6, 7) SMAC, DIABLO (Option A): These proteins promote apoptosis by inhibiting IAPs (Inhibitor of Apoptosis Proteins) , but they are not part of the apoptosome . Procaspase 9 and Caspase 9 (Option C): Caspase-9 is activated by the apoptosome , but does not form the apoptosome itself . Caspase 3, 6, 7 (Option D): These are executioner caspases that act downstream of the apoptosome-caspase 9 pathway.",

      "explanation": "efferocytosis. Efferocytosis: The apoptotic bodies give the eat-me signals, which are expressed as C1q, Thrombospondin, and PS (Phosphatidyl Serine). In the normal cell, the Phosphatidyl Serine is present in the inner leaflet, but in the apoptotic cell, it comes out. This is known as Phosphatidyl Serine Flipping (Defective in Scott syndrome). Based on this flipping, the Macrophage engulfs the apoptotic bodies, which is called Efferocytosis. Efferocytosis involves macrophages, epithelial cells, and fibroblasts. The term \"efferosome\" refers to a fluid-filled membrane vesicle that engulfs dead cells. It works in coordination with apoptosis because efferosomes engulf apoptotic cells before they are bleached out. Defects in efferocytosis are seen in SLE, cystic fibrosis, COPD, etc. Note : Cancer cells express CD47 to Macrophages. CD47 is a \"Do not Eat me\" signal.

      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Correct answer: C) Caspase 1 and inflammasome Explanation: Caspase 1 and inflammasome are the entities responsible for a form of cell death known as pyroptosis. Pyroptosis is a form of apoptosis in which there is release of the fever-inducing cytokine IL-1. Microbial products entering infected cells are recognized by cytoplasmic receptors, activating the multiprotein complex inflammasome. This complex activates caspase 1 which converts the inactive IL-1 to active IL-1, causing fever, inflammation and leucocyte recruitment Pyroptosis is the mechanism by which some microbes cause the death of infected cells and trigger local inflammation. Caspase 8 and FADD are involved in the extrinsic pathway of apoptosis. (Option A) RIPK3 and MLKL are involved in necroptosis.

It is a type of caspase-independent programmed cell death that presents with Inflammation. Necroptosis has features of both necrosis and apoptosis.

RIPK -1 [Receptor interacting Protein kinase] RIPK - 3 PROCASPASE 8 (Procaspase 8 is not converted to caspase 8 thus it is different from apoptosis) STEP 3 - MLKL phosphorylation MLKL leads to rupture of the cell membrane and cell death.
