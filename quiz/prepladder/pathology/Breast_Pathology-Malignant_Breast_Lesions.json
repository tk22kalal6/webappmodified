      "correct_answer": "D",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: D)Multiparity Explanation : Multiparity is not a risk factor for breast carcinoma. The clinical presentation of a 35-year-old female with swelling in the upper quadrant of her breast with skin changes in the skin and the surrounding nipple-areola complex is highly suggestive of carcinoma of the breast. Risk factors for breast carcinoma : Risk factors Relative risk Female gender. Increasing age. (Option C) Germline mutations of high penetrance. Strong family history (>1 first-degree relative, young age, multiple cancers). Personal history of breast cancer. High breast density. >4.0 Germline mutations of moderate penetrance. High-dose radiation to the chest at a young age. Family history (1 first-degree relative). 2.1-4.0 Early menarche (age <12 years). (Option B) Late menopause (age >55 years). Late first pregnancy (age >35 years). Nulliparity. Absence of breastfeeding. Exogenous hormone therapy. Postmenopausal obesity. Physical inactivity. High alcohol consumption. (Option A) 1.1-2.0 Relative risk is the likelihood of developing invasive carcinoma compared to women without any risk factors. Protective factors Early full term pregnancy Multiparity Lactation and breastfeeding Late menarche and early menopause Reference: Robbins and Cotran Textbook of Pathology, 10th Edition, Page 1047",

      "explanation": "Correct Answer: C) Ductal Carcinoma in Situ Explanation : The histopathological image shows features consistent with ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS), including malignant cells confined within the ductal system without invasion into surrounding tissue. This correlates with the clinical scenario of microcalcifications detected on mammography, a common presentation of DCIS. Types of DCIS : Comedo It may occasionally produce a vague nodularity but is often detected as clustered or linear and branching areas of calcification. Two features define it: Tumor cells with pleomorphic, high-grade nuclei. Areas of central necrosis. Cribriform It has rounded (cookie cutter–like) spaces, often filled with calcified secretory material. Micropapillary It produces complex bulbous protrusions without fibrovascular cores. Papillary It produces true papillae with fibrovascular cores that lack a myoepithelial cell layer. Solid The duct is full of cells and becomes solid. Histological images of",

      "explanation": "Correct Answer : D)Inflammatory carcinoma Explanation : Inflammatory breast carcinoma has a poor prognosis, with extensive invasion of subdermal lymphovascular channels and a 3-year survival rate of less than 10%. Poor prognostic factors for invasive breast carcinoma: Axillary lymph node status and metastases (via internal mammary lymph nodes). Distant metastases. Tumor size greater than 2 cm. Locally advanced disease with skin or lymphovascular invasion within lymphatics or small capillaries. Inflammatory carcinoma. Absence of ER , PR , and HER2 expression. Inflammatory Breast Carcinoma: It presents as breast erythema, swelling, and skin thickening. TNM staging - T4D Edematous skin is tethered to the breast by Cooper ligaments and mimics orange peel or peau d’orange . Microscopy: No inflammation is present. Diffuse lymphovascular space plugging with carcinoma cells in dermal lymphatics. The presentation can be confused with a breast infection, leading to delayed diagnosis. Usually high grade with very poor prognosis. Reference: Robbins and Cotran, Pathologic Basis of Disease, 10th edition, Page 1058",

(Statement 3) Microscopy Features: The tumor cells are dyscohesive, present back to back, and are called Indian file pattern. Shows minimal desmoplasia and fibrosis. (Statement 2) Unaffected ducts surrounded by tumor cells called the targetoid spread. Tumor cells trying to enter unaffected ducts are called pagetoid spread. It can contain signet ring cells , with little mucin in some places. Metastatic spread to the peritoneum and leptomeninges is called carcinomatous meningitis.",

      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Correct answer: B)1,2, and 4 Explanation : Paget’s disease Is an in-situ cancer.(Statement 1) The presence of Paget cells is needed for diagnosis. These cells are large atypical cells seen infiltrating and disrupting the epidermis of nipple and areola.(Statement 2) Gross features Eczematous Changes causes redness, scaling, and crusting and may involve ulceration in advanced cases. Flattening or inversion of the nipple is common. Lesions may appear well-demarcated or diffuse, spreading to the surrounding skin of the breast. May produce serous or bloody discharge The underlying carcinoma is usually ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS).(Statement 3) Immunostaining is positive for CEA.(Statement 4) Histopathology: Presence of Paget cells (Paget cells are pathognomonic): Large, atypical cells found within the nipple and areola epidermis. Epidermal invasion: Paget cells infiltrate and disrupt the normal epidermal architecture. Underlying breast carcinoma: Histological examination may reveal associated breast carcinoma, guiding treatment decisions. Paget’s Disease of Bone (Osteitis Deformans) is a chronic disorder of bone remodeling characterized by excessive bone resorption followed by disorganized bone formation. Presents with Bone pain, deformities (e.g., bowed legs, enlarged skull), pathological fractures and hearing loss (if skull is affected- cranial nerve compression) X-ray - Mixed lytic and sclerotic lesions \"Cotton wool\" appearance in skull and thickened cortical bone Complications: Osteoarthritis Fractures Sarcomatous transformation (osteosarcoma) Treatment: Bisphosphonates and Calcitonin for pain relief Paget’s Disease of the Vulva is a rare intraepithelial adenocarcinoma of the vulva, often associated with underlying malignancy. Presents with pruritus (persistent itching), erythematous , scaly , or velvety lesions on the vulva, burning sensation or discomfort Histopathology: Large cells with abundant pale cytoplasm ( Paget cells ) within the epidermis Diagnosis: Biopsy + Immunohistochemistry: Positive for CK7 and CEA",

        "D": "Mucinous carcinoma"
      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer : B) Medullary carcinoma Explanation : The biopsy results obtained from a patient’s breast lump carrying a low proliferative rate (better prognosis) is indicative of a luminal type A malignancy. Among the given options, medullary carcinoma of the breast does not belong to luminal type A; rather it is a luminal type B malignancy. Molecular classification of breast cancer is based on the results of receptor status such as ER, PR and HER2. Molecular classification of breast cancer : Classification Hormone receptor HER2/Neu Others Luminal A Positive (either or both ER/PR) Negative Ki-67 low Luminal B Positive (either or both ER/PR) Negative / Positive Ki-67 high Basal type (triple -ve) Negative Negative Ki-67 usually high HER2/neu enriched Negative Positive Ki-67 high Claudin low Negative Negative Claudin low Luminal A (Low proliferation rate) Tubular carcinoma (Option A ruled out). Papillary carcinoma ( Option C ruled out). Mucinous carcinoma (Option D ruled out). Low-grade ILC. Luminal B (High proliferation rate) High-grade ILC. HER2/Neu rich Apocrine carcinoma. Micropapillary carcinoma. Triple-negative Medullary carcinoma. (Option B) Metaplastic carcinoma. Secretory carcinoma. Adenoid cystic carcinoma. Breast cancers with ER/PR+ receptor status usually have a low rate of proliferation and a better prognosis, unlike those with ER/PR-, as is the case with medullary carcinoma. Hence, it is less likely to be the histological subtype in this patient. Reference: Robbins and Cotran, Pathologic basis of Disease, 10th edition.

      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "membranes rather than the nucleus suggest the diagnosis of a HER2 receptor rich breast carcinoma. Apocrine carcinoma is one of the two most common HER2 receptor-rich subtypes of invasive breast carcinoma, the other one being micropapillary carcinoma. Trastuzumab is a monoclonal antibody that acts by inhibiting the HER2 receptors and prevents further growth of the tumor, since HER2 receptor rich tumors respond well to HER2 inhibitor therapy. Medullary carcinoma (Option B) is a triple negative subtype. Tubular and papillary carcinomas (Option C and D) are ER/PR positive subtypes hence considered Luminal A.",
