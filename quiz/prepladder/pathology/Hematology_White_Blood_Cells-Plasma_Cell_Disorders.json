      "explanation": "Correct Answer: C) Trisomy 21 Explanation: The patient most likely has Multiple myeloma (MM) , a plasma cell neoplasm associated with hyper c alcemia, r enal failure, a naemia, lytic b one lesions ( CRAB features) and immune abnormalities. Trisomy 21 is associated with Down’s syndrome and not multiple myeloma. It is seen in patients 60-70 years of age. There are 3 main cytogenetic abnormalities seen in MM. Deletion of chromosome 13q (also seen in CLL) (Option A) Translocation t (11;14) (also seen in mantle cell lymphoma) (Option B) Deletion of chromosome 17p (TP53) (Option D) IL-6 essential for plasma cell growth , elevated IL-6 linked to poor prognosis. Antibodies in Multiple Myeloma: Monoclonal Immunoglobulins Free Light Chains IgG: Most common (55% of patients). IgA: Seen in 25% of cases. IgM, IgD, IgE: Less common. Often produced in excess, called Bence Jones proteins. Can cause myeloma kidney (renal disease). Pathogenesis of Multiple Myeloma: Renal failure in multiple myeloma is usually higher in IgD subtype. Increased plasma cells activate MiP1 α , resulting in Increased osteoclastic activity leads to bone resorption hypercalcemia and lytic punched-out lesions.

        "D": "30°C"
      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Correct answer: B) 60°C Explanation: The clinical presentation and Bence Jones proteinuria are consistent with Multiple myeloma Multiple myeloma cells produce excess free light chains, either alongside complete immunoglobulins or independently. Due to their small size, free light chains (Bence Jones proteins) can pass through the glomeruli of the kidneys and appear in urine. This is a diagnostic marker for multiple myeloma. Bence Jones Proteinuria: The presence of Bence Jones proteins in urine contributes to myeloma kidney, a form of renal damage. These light chains exert toxic effects on renal tubular epithelial cells, leading to renal impairment. It is a kappa or lambda light chain immunoglobulin that precipitates in the urine at 40-60°C . When boiling, it disappears and reappears when cooling. Urine and serum electrophoresis show a characteristic M spike due to increased levels of monoclonal IgG.

Bone marrow biopsy showed a high percentage of plasma cells, and cytogenetic analysis revealed a deletion of chromosome 17p.

      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: C) CD56 Explanation: The clinical scenario is consistent with Multiple myeloma with poor prognosis. CD56 is a marker commonly overexpressed on plasma cells in multiple myeloma, and it helps to differentiate malignant cells from normal plasma cells. Prognostic factors of Multiple myeloma Good prognosis: t(11;14) chromosomal abnormality is associated with a better prognosis compared to high-risk cytogenetic features like t(4;14) and del(17p) Poor prognosis: ↑ Beta-2 Microglobulin Level; ↑ IL-6; ↑ Lactate Dehydrogenase; High serum to free light chain levels Deletions of chromosome 17p (TP53) Flow cytometry Markers Normal plasma cells Multiple myeloma plasma cells CD19 + - CD45 + - CD 38 + + CD138 (Syndecan-1) + + CD56 - + CD19 (Option A): It is a pan-B cell marker, absent on malignant plasma cells in multiple myeloma but may be expressed on normal plasma cells. CD 38 (Option B): CD38 is a marker highly expressed on plasma cells , both normal and malignant. High levels of CD38 are a characteristic feature of multiple myeloma plasma cells. However, CD38 is also found on other cells, so it is combined with other markers like CD138 to identify malignant plasma cells specifically. CD 117 (Option D): CD117 , or c-kit , is a receptor tyrosine kinase that is sometimes expressed on hematopoietic stem cells and progenitor cells . CD117 can be expressed in multiple myeloma and is associated with a poorer prognosis. However, its presence is less common than CD56 in multiple myeloma cells. When positive, it can indicate a more aggressive disease course.

      "explanation": "Correct Answer: B) Serum creatinine levels Explanation: The patient presents with multiple myeloma features in which renal involvement is common due to factors like hypercalcemia and the deposition of monoclonal light chains in the renal tubules (light chain cast nephropathy). Serum creatinine levels are the most commonly used biochemical test to assess renal function and detect kidney damage. Biochemical tests useful in the diagnosis of Multiple Myeloma Serum Protein Electrophoresis (SPEP): Detects and measures M-proteins in blood, aiding in multiple myeloma diagnosis and monitoring. But does not help in assessing kidney damage. (Option A) Urine Protein Electrophoresis (UPEP): Identifies Bence Jones proteins in urine, supporting multiple myeloma diagnosis. (Option D) Serum Free Light Chain Assay: Measures free kappa and lambda light chains, useful for diagnosis and treatment monitoring. Serum creatinine: Elevated levels indicate renal impairment. Serum calcium: Commonly elevated due to bone resorption. But does not assess renal function (Option C) CBC: Look for anaemia, leukopenia, or thrombocytopenia.

      "explanation": "Correct Answer: D) Smouldering Myeloma Explanation: The clinical findings suggest Smouldering Myeloma . It is a precursor condition to multiple myeloma, lying between Monoclonal Gammopathy of Undetermined Significance (MGUS) and symptomatic multiple myeloma. It is characterised by the presence of monoclonal protein in the absence of end-organ damage , with bone marrow plasma cell infiltration of ≥ 10% and <30% without myeloma-defining events.

      "correct_answer": "D",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: D) Waldenstrom’s Macroglobulinemia Explanation: The clinical presentation suggests Waldenstrom’s macroglobulinemia, a lymphoproliferative disorder characterised by the presence of monoclonal IgM antibodies . Waldenström Macroglobulinemia (WM): Increased association with Lymphoplasmacytic Lymphoma (LPL) It is also associated with MYD 88 mutation. Patients may present with symptoms of hyperviscosity syndrome , such as blurred vision, dizziness, and bleeding tendencies. Diagnosis: monoclonal IgM gammopathy on serum protein electrophoresis (SPEP) or immunofixation electrophoresis (IFE) Hyperviscosity Syndrome: Caused by high levels of IgM increasing blood viscosity. Visual Impairment: Sluggish blood flow and venous congestion in the retinal veins cause visual disturbances, retinal haemorrhages, and exudates. Neurological Issues: Reduced brain blood flow leads to headaches, dizziness, deafness, and stupor. Bleeding: Macroglobulins form complexes with clotting factors and interfere with platelet function, increasing bleeding risk. Cryoglobulinemia: Macroglobulins precipitate at low temperatures, causing Raynaud phenomenon and cold urticaria. Treatment: Observation, immunotherapy, chemotherapy, and plasmapheresis for hyperviscosity symptoms. Multiple Myeloma (Option A): Multiple myeloma is characterised by the presence of monoclonal IgG or IgA antibodies, not IgM . Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia (Option B): CLL is a B-cell malignancy characterised by the accumulation of monoclonal B lymphocytes and not IgM antibodies. IgA Myeloma (Option C): A subtype of multiple myeloma that primarily produces monoclonal IgA. While it can cause hyperviscosity syndrome, it is not characterised by an IgM spike.

      "explanation": "Correct Answer: B) Gamma Heavy Chain Disease Explanation : The clinical scenario is consistent with Gamma heavy chain disease (Franklin’s Disease). Heavy-chain diseases are rare monoclonal gammopathies characterized by the production and secretion of free heavy-chain fragments. These diseases can be associated with various disorders, including: Lymphoplasmacytic Lymphoma Small Bowel Marginal Zone Lymphoma Gamma heavy chain disease (Franklin's disease): (Option B) Present with systemic symptoms & sometimes palatal and uvular swelling. Involves the production of abnormal monoclonal gamma heavy chains without associated light chains , resulting in hypogammaglobulinemia and recurrent infections. Serum protein electrophoresis (SPEP) reveals a monoclonal spike in the gamma region. Alpha heavy chain disease (Seligmann's Disease) (Option A): The most common type. Often presents as a gastrointestinal immunoproliferative small intestinal disease (IPSID). Mu heavy chain disease (Option C): A very rare subtype that resembles chronic lymphocytic leukaemia/small lymphocytic leukaemia Delta heavy chain disease (Option D): Extremely rare subtype.
