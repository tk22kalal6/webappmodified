Bronchoalveolar lavage shows hemosiderin-laden macrophages, as shown in the image below. What is the most likely diagnosis?",

      "explanation": "Correct Answer: B) Left-sided heart failure Explanation: The patient's symptoms and the histopathological findings of hemosiderin - laden macrophages known as ‘ Heart failure cells ’ are consistent with Left-sided heart failure. This condition is characterized by the heart's inability to pump blood effectively, leading to pulmonary congestion and oedema. Chronic congestion and microhemorrhages in the lungs result in the accumulation of hemosiderin - laden macrophages (Heart failure cells). These cells can be identified using special",

      },
      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: C) Fibrosis in periportal areas of the liver Explanation: Fibrosis in the periportal areas of the liver is typically seen in chronic liver diseases caused by factors like viral hepatitis, alcoholic liver disease, non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), or autoimmune hepatitis, not in right-sided heart failure. In severe right-sided heart failure, fibrosis occurs in the central areas of the liver (centrilobular fibrosis) due to chronic hypoxia or congestion affecting the central veins within the liver lobules and is known as Cardiac cirrhosis. Options A, B, and D are the pathological changes seen in Right-sided heart failure. Nutmeg liver appearance (Option A): In severe right-sided heart failure, the central veins become congested with blood due to systemic venous congestion, leading to red-brown pericentral zones and relatively normal-coloured tan periportal regions, resulting in a characteristic appearance known as a \"Nutmeg liver.\" This congestion can lead to hepatomegaly, elevated liver enzymes, and, eventually, centrilobular necrosis. Pretibial oedema (Option B): Pretibial oedema is indeed a hallmark of right-sided heart failure due to fluid accumulation in the dependent areas of the body. Congestive splenomegaly (Option D): Enlargement of the spleen can occur as a result of portal hypertension secondary to right-sided heart failure, leading to increased pressure in the portal venous system and splenic sequestration of platelets.

      "correct_answer": "D",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: D) Prinzmetal Angina Explanation: Angina pectoris is characterized by paroxysmal and usually recurrent attacks of substernal or precordial chest discomfort caused by transient myocardial ischemia without the death of myocytes. Stable Angina Prinzmetal variant angina Unstable or crescendo angina Occurs During physical exertion and emotional stress due to ↑ myocardial demands.

      "question": "A 58-year-old man presents to the emergency department with sudden-onset chest pain radiating to his left arm and jaw, along with diaphoresis and anxiety. His vital signs show a blood pressure of 160/90 mmHg, heart rate of 110 bpm, and oxygen saturation of 94% on room air. An ECG reveals ST-segment elevation in leads II, III, and aVF, suggestive of acute myocardial infarction (MI).

        "D": "Atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP)"
      },
      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: C) Cardiac-specific troponin I (cTnI) Explanation: Cardiac-specific troponins (cTnT and cTnI) are highly specific biomarkers for myocardial damage and are considered the gold standard for diagnosing acute myocardial infarction (MI). They are proteins that regulate calcium-mediated contraction in cardiac muscle. Elevated cTn levels above threshold levels are more specific to “myocardial injury” than ischemia but not to acute coronary syndrome (ACS); hence, elevated cTn levels should be interpreted alongside the patient's clinical history and ECG findings. Troponin levels start to rise within 2-4 hours after myocardial infarction, peak at 24-48 hours and can remain elevated for several days. Troponin levels are important for risk stratification after both ST-elevation Myocardial infarction (STEMI) and non-ST elevation Myocardial infarction (NSTEMI). Troponin is also the best marker for reinfarction and a ≥ 20% rise from baseline during serial monitoring indicates reinfarction.

      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: B) Intracellular calcium overload Explanation: Following PCI for acute MI with ST-segment elevation, the patient likely experienced cardiac deterioration due to re-perfusion injury, characterized by tissue damage from restored blood flow. Intracellular calcium overload is the most likely the primary mechanism responsible for the reperfusion injury in this patient. During PCI, re-perfusion of the occluded coronary artery can lead to a sudden influx of calcium into cardiomyocytes , known as calcium paradox , which can cause cell injury and dysfunction. The presence of ' Contraction bands ' in cardiac muscle tissue serves as histological markers of re-perfusion injury.

Explanation: In myocardial infarctions (MIs) less than 4 hours, gross examination may not reveal the infarcted area. However, immersion of tissue slices in triphenyl tetrazolium chloride (TTC) solution can highlight the necrotic area. This histochemical stain imparts a brick-red colour to intact, non infarcted myocardium with preserved lactate dehydrogenase activity. Conversely, infarcted tissue appears as an unstained pale zone because of leakage of dehydrogenases through the damaged membranes of dead cells.
