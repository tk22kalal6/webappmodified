        "D": "H, A and B antibodies will always be present in the serum"
      },
      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: C) Lack of antigens of several blood group systems Explanation: People with the Bombay phenotype (the rarest blood group in the world) express no A, B, or H antigens on the red blood cells. (Option A ruled out) They are homozygous for the silent h allele (represented as h). The antigens are not present in the saliva, either. (Option B ruled out) As the antigens are not expressed, the serum will always present the H, A, and B antibodies. (Option D ruled out) Antigens from other blood group systems (e.g., Rh, MNS, etc.) are still present on the RBC (Option C) It is strongly associated with leukocyte adhesion defect 2 ABO antigens are present not only in the red blood cells but also in the other blood cells, in most body fluids (except CSF), cell membranes of tissues such as the intestine, urothelium and vascular endothelium. They do not lack antigens from other blood group systems. Reference: Wintrobe’s Clinical Hematology, 12th Edition, Pages 635, 636",

      "question": "A 23-year-old individual is scheduled to donate blood for a local blood drive. To ensure the safety of the blood supply, the donor's blood will be screened for various infectious diseases. Among the following options, which one is typically not included in the routine screening for donated blood?",

      },
      "correct_answer": "D",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: D) Dengue fever Explanation : Dengue fever is a viral illness transmitted by Aedes mosquitoes. Unlike some other diseases listed, routine screening for dengue in donated blood is not typically performed. This is because mosquitoes primarily transmit dengue rather than through blood transfusions. Screening for transfusion-transmitted infections: The following infections can be transmitted by blood transfusion. Viral Bacterial Parasites Others Hepatitis (A, B, C, G). HIV (I & II). HTLV (I & II). CMV. EBV. Parvovirus B19. Syphilis Malaria Babesiosis Trypanosoma cruzi Creutzfeldt- Jakob disease Plasma processing methods have been shown to inactivate most recognised infectious organisms, except for non-lipid-enveloped viruses and prions. All clinically relevant blood components transmit prion disease following a single blood transfusion. Malaria can also be transmitted by most blood components (red cells, platelets, white-cell concentrates, cryoprecipitates, and frozen red cells after thawing and washing). Transmission from single-donor FFP has not been reported. In India, the following five diseases are screened: HBV (Option B) . HCV. HIV (Option C) . Malaria (Option A) . Syphilis. Screening for the diseases mentioned above is mandatory , and transfusing unscreened blood is a medical offence.

The unit must be removed from the refrigeration and the temperature must be brought up to the room temperature before transfusion Once a unit of RBCs is removed from the refrigerator, it should be transfused as soon as possible, ideally starting within 30 minutes. The entire unit should be infused within 4 hours as hemolysis occurs after 4 hours which can lead to fatal hyperkalemia Duration times for transfusion of blood and blood products: Blood product Start time End time Whole blood/PRBC Within 30 minutes of removing it from the refrigerator ≤ 4 hours Discard if this period is exceeded Platelets Immediately Within 30 minutes FFP Immediately Within 30 minutes Cryoprecipitate Immediately Within 30 minutes Reference: Harmening, D.

        "C": "Delayed Hemolytic Reaction",
        "D": "Febrile Non-hemolytic reaction"
      },
      "correct_answer": "D",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: D) Febrile Non-hemolytic reaction Explanation : Febrile non-hemolytic transfusion reactions (FNHTRs) are the most common complication of blood transfusions. These reactions typically occur when the recipient's immune system responds to the transfused blood product's white blood cells or cytokines. FNHTRs are characterised by fever and chills during or shortly after a transfusion. Pathophysiology: FNHTRs are typically caused by: Recipient Immune Response: The recipient's immune system reacts to leukocytes (white blood cells) or cytokines (inflammatory mediators) in the donor blood product. Accumulation of Cytokines: Cytokines accumulate in blood products during storage. When these cytokine-rich products are transfused, they can induce an inflammatory response in the recipient. Management: Stop the Transfusion. Supportive Care. Antipyretics. Prevention: Using leukoreduced blood products (where leukocytes are removed before storage) can significantly reduce the incidence of FNHTRs . Pre-storage Leukoreduction : This technique is more effective in reducing FNHTRs than bedside filtration. Use of Leukoreduction filter filters out white blood cells (WBCs) from blood products to reduce adverse transfusion reactions. Lowers the risk of alloimmunization to human leukocyte antigens (HLAs). Minimizes immune responses caused by donor leukocytes. Reduces cytomegalovirus transmission since the virus resides in WBCs. TRALI (Transfusion-related acute lung injury) (Option A) is a serious transfusion reaction characterised by acute respiratory distress and non-cardiogenic pulmonary edema. It typically occurs within 6 hours of transfusion and is caused by an immune response to donor antibodies or bioactive substances in the transfused blood. TACO (Transfusion-associated circulatory overload) (Option B) occurs when a transfusion is administered too quickly or when the volume of transfused blood exceeds the recipient's circulatory capacity. It leads to volume overload and pulmonary edema due to increased hydrostatic pressure in the pulmonary vasculature. Delayed hemolytic reactions (Option C) occur days to weeks after a transfusion and are caused by an immune response to minor antigens on transfused red blood cells. Symptoms may include mild fever, jaundice, and a gradual decline in hemoglobin levels due to hemolysis.",

      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: B) Metabolic Acidosis Explanation: Metabolic acidosis can occur in the setting of shock and hypoperfusion rather than directly from the transfusion itself, so it is not likely seen in massive blood transfusion. Due to the large volume of blood and blood products administered, massive blood transfusion can lead to various complications. Complications of massive blood transfusion: Hypocalcemia (Option D) : Packed red blood cells (PRBCs) and other blood products are preserved with citrate , an anticoagulant. Citrate binds to ionized calcium (Ca² I ) in the recipient's blood, reducing the free calcium level - hypocalcemia Presents as muscle spasms, cardiac arrhythmias, and decreased myocardial contractility. Metabolic Alkalosis (Option A) : Citrate is metabolized in the liver to bicarbonate (HCO II ) . Rapid transfusion of citrate-containing blood products can overwhelm the liver’s ability to metabolize citrate, leading to an increase in bicarbonate levels. This results in metabolic alkalosis Hyperkalemia (Option C) : Stored blood undergoes hemolysis over time, releasing potassium from red blood cells into the plasma. Transfusion of large volumes of stored blood can introduce a significant potassium load, causing hyperkalemia . Presents with cardiac arrhythmias, especially in patients with pre-existing kidney dysfunction. Hypothermia : Rapid transfusion of cold-stored blood products (typically kept at 1–6°C) can lower the patient’s core body temperature.. Coagulopathy : Massive transfusion dilutes clotting factors and platelets, leading to dilutional coagulopathy . Hypothermia and hypocalcemia exacerbate this by impairing the function of coagulation enzymes and platelets. Hypokalemia : Post-transfusion, potassium that had leaked out of stored red blood cells can re-enter the cells in vivo. This shift can lead to hypokalemia , especially if the patient has a strong cellular uptake of potassium. Reference: Harmening, D. M. (2012). Modern Blood Banking & Transfusion Practices (6th ed.).",

      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: A) Non-cardiogenic pulmonary edema within 6 hours of transfusion Explanation : TRALI is characterised by acute onset of respiratory distress and non-cardiogenic pulmonary edema occurring within 6 hours of a blood transfusion. It is caused by an immune reaction to donor antibodies or bioactive substances in the transfused blood. Characteristics: Onset: TRALI typically occurs within 6 hours of transfusion. Symptoms: Sudden onset of dyspnea (shortness of breath). Hypoxemia (low blood oxygen levels) Fever. Hypotension. Bilateral pulmonary infiltrates on a chest X-ray, indicating fluid accumulation in the lungs without cardiac cause. acute lung injury (TRALI).

Non-immune Factors: Biological response modifiers like cytokines and lipids that accumulate during blood product storage can also contribute. Prevention: Using plasma from male or female donors who have never been pregnant (nulliparous) can reduce the risk, as they are less likely to have antibodies that can cause TRALI. Blood banks may screen donors for antibodies known to cause TRALI. TACO is characterised by a gradual onset of respiratory distress and cardiogenic pulmonary edema within 24 hours of transfusion(Option B). It occurs when a patient receives a transfusion volume that exceeds their circulatory capacity, leading to fluid overload and cardiac dysfunction. Acute onset of fever and chills without respiratory symptoms (Option C) is seen in febrile non-hemolytic transfusion reactions (FNHTR), which are characterised by fever and chills without respiratory distress. Gradual onset of jaundice and anemia several days after transfusion (Option D) is more indicative of delayed hemolytic transfusion reactions, which occur days to weeks after transfusion.
