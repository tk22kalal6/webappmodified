      "explanation": "Correct Answer: B) Aspiration of infective material Explanation: Given the clinical presentation of productive cough, fever, fatigue, and the presence of a thick-walled cavity with surrounding consolidation on chest X-ray, the most likely diagnosis is a lung abscess. Lung abscess: It describes a local suppurative process that produces necrosis of the lung tissue. Aetiology: Bacteroides , Fusobacterium , and Peptostreptococcus (the three most common bacteria). Aerobic and anaerobic Streptococci, S. aureus, and gram-negative organisms. Risk factors: Aspiration of infective material (the most frequent cause) (Option B) . Septic embolism. (Option C) Morphology: Pulmonary abscesses due to aspiration are more common on the right (because of the more vertical right main bronchus ) and are most often single.

      "correct_answer": "D",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: D) Klebsiella pneumoniae Explanation: The clinical presentation of a patient who is a known alcoholic , presenting with high-grade fever, productive cough, rust-coloured (red currant jelly) sputum, right-sided pleuritic chest pain, decreased breath sounds over the right lower lung fields, and neutrophilia is suggestive of pneumonia caused by Klebsiella pneumoniae. Klebsiella pneumoniae: It is the most common cause of gram-negative bacterial pneumonia. It causes typical pneumonia with neutrophil-rich exudate that fills the bronchi, bronchioles, and adjacent alveolar spaces. It commonly afflicts debilitated and malnourished people , particularly chronic alcoholics. Thick, mucoid (often blood-tinged) sputum is characteristic because the organism produces an abundant viscid capsular polysaccharide , which the patient may have difficulty expectorating. Mycoplasma Pneumonia (Option A) Mycoplasma pneumonia causes atypical pneumonia with dry cough, fever, and fatigue. It often presents with mild symptoms but can lead to complications. It presents with a persistent dry cough, low-grade fever, sore throat, headache, and fatigue. Chest X-ray findings may appear worse than clinical symptoms. It spreads via respiratory droplets and is common in young adults and crowded settings. Treatment includes macrolides or tetracyclines. Legionella pneumophila (Option B): Legionella pneumophila is the agent of legionnaires’ disease and Pontiac fever , a self-limited upper respiratory tract infection. It flourishes in artificial aquatic environments, such as water-cooling towers and the tubing systems of domestic (potable) water supplies. It is common in individuals with predisposing conditions such as cardiac, renal, immunologic, or hematologic disease and organ transplant recipients . Moraxella catarrhalis (Option C): Moraxella catarrhalis is recognised as a cause of bacterial pneumonia, especially in the elderly . It is the second most common bacterial cause of acute exacerbation of COPD. Along with S. pneumoniae and H. influenzae, M. catarrhalis is one of the three most common causes of otitis media in children.

      "correct_answer": "D",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: D) Nelson syndrome Explanation: Nelson syndrome is not associated with aspiration. It is a rare disorder that occurs in some individuals who have undergone surgical removal of both adrenal glands to treat Cushing's disease. It is characterised by the growth of a pituitary tumour, often resulting in elevated levels of ACTH and increased skin pigmentation. Aspiration pneumonia: It occurs in markedly debilitated patients or those who aspirate gastric contents either while unconscious (e.g., after a stroke) or during repeated vomiting. Predisposing factors: Abnormal gag and swallowing reflexes. The resultant pneumonia is partly chemical due to the irritating effects of gastric acid and partly bacterial (from the oral flora). More than one organism is recovered in culture (aerobes > anaerobes). It is often necrotising with a fulminant clinical course, and a frequent cause of death. In patients who survive, lung abscess is a common complication. Conditions associated with aspiration: Mendelson syndrome (Option A): It occurs due to aspiration of gastric contents during general anaesthesia. Risk factors: Pregnancy. Gastric volume >25 ml (0.4 mL/kg). Gastric pH <2.5 Meconium aspiration syndrome (Option C) : It usually occurs in term or post-term babies who are small for gestational age (IUGR).

      },
      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: A) Th2-mediated macrophage activation and killing of bacteria. Explanation: The clinical presentation of a 45-year-old male with a persistent cough, night sweats, unintentional weight loss, and chest X-ray showing an infiltrate in the upper lobe of the right lung is suggestive of pulmonary tuberculosis. Th2-mediated macrophage activation and bacteria killing is not seen in tuberculosis. Rather, a Th-1-mediated response is seen. Pathogenesis of tuberculosis: Infection by M. tuberculosis proceeds in steps, from initial infection of macrophages to a subsequent Th1 response that both contains the bacteria and causes tissue damage. Early in infection, M. tuberculosis replicates essentially unchecked within macrophages, and later in infection, the cell response stimulates macrophages to contain the proliferation of the bacteria. The steps for infection are as follows: Entry into macrophages M. tuberculosis enters macrophages by phagocytosis . Replication in macrophages M. tuberculosis inhibits the maturation of the phagosome. It blocks the formation of the phagolysosome (Option B) , allowing the bacterium to replicate unchecked within the vesicle. Thus, during the earliest stage of primary tuberculosis (<3 weeks) in the nonsensitized individual, bacteria proliferate in the pulmonary alveolar macrophages and air spaces, resulting in bacteremia and seeding of multiple sites. Despite the bacteremia, most people at this stage are asymptomatic or have a mild flu-like illness. Innate immunity (Option C) Mycobacterial lipoarabinomannan binds TLR2 , and unmethylated CpG nucleotides bind TLR9. These interactions initiate and enhance the innate and adaptive immune responses to M. tuberculosis, as described below. Th1 response , Th1 mediated macrophage activation, and killing of the bacteria (mediated by IFN- γ ). Granulomatous inflammation and damage (mediated by Th1 response ) (Option D) . Caseous necrosis and giant cell formation (epithelioid histiocytes-giant cells, mediated by IFN- γ ). Reference: Robbins & Cotran Pathologic Basis of Disease,10th Edition, Page 378",

It is of the following types. Primary tuberculosis It develops in a previously unexposed and therefore unsensitized person. The primary organ involved is mostly the lungs . Location: Sub-pleural region. Lower part of the upper lobe & upper part of the lower lobe. Ghon’s focus: Grey-white area of inflammation with consolidation. Ghon’s complex: Ghon’s focus + inflamed regional lymph nodes (Statment iii) . Histology: Granulomatous inflammatory reaction with both caseating and non-caseating tubercles. Simon’s focus: Occult hematogenous dissemination to the apex of the lung. (Statement ii) Fate: 95% of the cases are controlled by immunity, calcified, healed lesions and hilar lymph nodes ( Ranke complex ). 5% of the cases are progressive (Progressive primary TB). Resembles acute bacterial pneumonia. Lymphohematogenous dissemination may cause tuberculous meningitis and/or miliary TB. Secondary tuberculosis It arises in a previously sensitised host. It may follow shortly after primary tuberculosis, but more commonly, it appears months to years after the initial infection, usually when the host resistance is weakened. The apical and posterior lobe segments are involved due to high O 2 concentration ( Puhl’s focus ) (Statement i) . The infraclavicular lesion is called Assman’s focus. Regional lymph node involvement is late. Cavitation occurs readily with the erosion of the cavities into an airway. Histology: Active lesions show coalescent tubercles with central caseation (Caseous necrosis). Disseminated TB: Spread to other organs. The images below show the caseous necrosis seen in TB. Other foci: Simmond focus: Liver. Weighert focus: Blood vessels (Statement iv) Rich’s focus: Brain.",
