      "question": "Which of the following diseases are correctly associated with their respective inclusion bodies?",
      "options": {
        "A": "Rabies - Lewy bodies",

      "correct_answer": "D",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: D) Malakoplakia - Michaelis Gutmann bodies Explanation: Michaelis Gutmann bodies are seen in Malakoplakia. Disease Inclusion bodies Rabies Negri bodies are cytoplasmic, round to oval, eosinophilic inclusions found in pyramidal neurons of the hippocampus and Purkinje cells of the cerebellum , sites usually devoid of inflammation. Parkinson’s disease Lewy bodies These are single or multiple, cytoplasmic, eosinophilic, round to elongated inclusions that often have a dense core surrounded by a pale halo. They are composed of fine filaments, densely packed in the core but loose at the rim; these filaments are composed of α -synuclein. Multiple myeloma The globular inclusions are referred to as Russell bodies (if cytoplasmic) or Dutcher bodies (if nuclear). Malakoplakia Michaelis Gutmann bodies: Laminated mineralized concretions resulting from calcium deposition in enlarged lysosomes.",
