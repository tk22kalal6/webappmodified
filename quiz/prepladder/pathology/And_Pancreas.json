Hepatoblastoma is the most common liver tumour of childhood. Activation of the Wnt signalling pathway is characteristic of hepatoblastoma, leading to nuclear β -catenin and increased expression of Wnt target genes such as glutamine synthetase in nearly all cases. It is important to note that elevated AFP is not pathognomonic to hepatocellular carcinoma. Conditions where AFP is raised are listed below : Malignancy Non-malignant conditions Hepatocellular carcinoma Hepatoblastoma Secondary liver metastasis Nonseminomatous germ cell tumours Yolk sac tumour Neural tube defects Ataxia telangiectasia CA 19-9 and Neurotensin markers are elevated in Heptatocellular carcinoma.

SPINK1 (Option C) Autosomal recessive inheritance Loss of function mutation encoding a trypsin inhibitor CFTR (cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator) (Option D) Loss of CFTR leads to abnormal secretions Promote plugging and duct obstruction Associated conditions: recurrent sinopulmonary infections, intestinal obstruction, diabetes, and male infertility. CASR (Calcium-sensing receptor): Mutation alters calcium concentrations and activates trypsin. CTRC (Chymotrypsin C): Responsible for protecting pancreas from trypsin-related injury.
