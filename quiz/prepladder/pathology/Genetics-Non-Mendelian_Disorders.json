      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: C) Fragile-X syndrome Explanation: Fragile-X syndrome shows X-linked Recessive > X-linked dominant inheritance. Leber hereditary optic neuropathy (LHON) is characterized by permanent loss of vision in young men due to progressive, bilateral optic neuropathy. LHON demonstrates mitochondrial inheritance. Mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) is inherited solely maternally. Thus, females with causative mtDNA may transmit the disease to all offspring. However, the disease's expression is variable due to heteroplasmy (the combination of both mutant and wild DNA in offspring). Mitochondrial diseases thus affect organs with prominent aerobic metabolism. Skeletal muscle (myopathy) and nervous system involvement are common. Some other examples are: Chronic progressive external ophthalmoplegia (CPEO)/ Kearns-Sayre syndrome (KSS) Leigh syndrome Mitochondrial encephalomyopathy with lactic acidosis and stroke-like episodes (MELAS) Myoclonic epilepsy with ragged red fibers (MERRF) Neuropathy, ataxia, and retinitis pigmentosa (NARP) Primary coenzyme Q10 (CoQ10) deficiency Reference: https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mitochondrial-myopathies-clinical-features-and-diagnosis",

      "question": "A 25-year-old male presents with brief, abrupt, involuntary movements of his arms and face for the last 2 months. A history of Huntington's disease in his father, who was diagnosed at 40 years of age and passed away at the age of 50, is found. What is the mechanism behind this patient’s earlier presentation?",

        "D": "Non-penetrance"
      },
      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: A) Anticipation Explanation: The given case scenario describes a young male with Huntington’s disease who has manifested the disease at a younger age than his father. HD is a trinucleotide repeat disorder (CAG) that is characterized by psychiatric disturbances and choreoathetosis early on, with cognitive disturbance and death later. HD is characterized by anticipation. Anticipation refers to the phenomenon whereby a genetic disease manifests earlier and is more severe in subsequent generations. It is typically seen in trinucleotide repeat disorders due to increased trinucleotide repeats in the genome of subsequent generations. Examples of diseases showing anticipation include: Autosomal Dominant Autosomal Recessive Multiple spinocerebellar ataxias Huntington’s disease – CAG repeats Myotonic dystrophy – CTG Congenital dyskeratosis – TTAGGG (telomere repeating sequence) Friedreich’s ataxia – GAA X-linked Fragile X Syndrome – CGG Others Crohn’s disease Behcet’s disease Mosaicism (Option B) refers to the presence of two genetically different cell lines in the same individual, which results in variable phenotypic expression. An example is Turner syndrome. Imprinting (Option C) refers to a phenomenon where one copy of the gene is silenced via epigenetic mechanisms (e.g., methylation), and the other copy is expressed. Examples are Prader-Willi and Angelman syndromes. Non-penetrance (Option D) - This is a scenario where the patient has a disease-causing mutation but does not have the phenotype or disease. An example is a BRCA1 mutation-positive female who never develops breast or ovarian cancer. Reference: https://www.uptodate.com/contents/huntington-disease-clinical-features-and-diagnosis",

        "D": "Monosomy"
      },
      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: A) Imprinting Explanation: The given clinical scenario likely describes Angelman syndrome. Angelman syndrome (AS) and Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS) are examples of genetic imprinting, a phenomenon where one copy of the gene is silenced via epigenetic mechanisms (typically methylation) while the other is deleted/ mutated. In AS, the paternal 15q11-q13 region is imprinted, while the maternal region is deleted/ mutated. In PWS, the opposite is true. Implicated genes in UBE3 in AS and SNORP in PWS. Robertsonian translocation (Option B) is characterized by the amplification of a sequence of three nucleotides. This refers to the fusion of the long arms of two acrocentric chromosomes. Unbalanced translocation can result in the loss of genetic material, causing diseases like Down syndrome and Patau syndrome. Trinucleotide repeats (Option C) is characterized by the amplification of a sequence of three nucleotides. This refer to an excessive and unstable number of trinucleotide copies, which may cause diseases like HD, FXS, etc. Monosomy (Option D) This refers to the loss of one chromosome from a pair. One prominent example is Turner’s syndrome (46XO). Reference: Robbins and Cotrans Pathological Basis of Diseases, 10th Edition, Page 178.",

      "question": "Which of the following explains a single mutant gene leading to different end effects in sickle cell anemia?",
      "options": {
        "A": "Variable expressivity",
        "B": "Variable penetrance",
        "C": "Pleiotropy",
        "D": "Genetic heterogeneity"
      },
      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Correct answer: C) Pleiotropy Explanation: A single mutant gene leading to many end effects is called pleiotropism , whereas mutations at several genetic loci producing a similar phenotypic effect are called genetic heterogeneity. Sickle cell anemia is an example of pleiotropy with a single gene mutation causing multiple physical effects. The mutation produces hemoglobin S (HbS) , which makes red blood cells prone to hemolysis. Additionally, it can lead to complications like splenic fibrosis, organ infarcts, and bone pains. All these diverse effects on different organs stem from the initial issue of HbS production. Variable penetrance (Option B) refers to a condition where individuals inherit the mutant gene but are phenotypically normal. Variable expressivity (Option A) refers to the phenomenon where individuals with the same genetic mutation display different levels and types of symptoms or traits. For example, with Marfan syndrome, one person might experience primarily skeletal issues while another could have serious cardiovascular problems, but all these are due to a single primary defect i.e. mutation in the gene FBN1 encoding fibrillin-1.",

      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: B) Heteroplasmy Explanation: The presence of both wild-type and mutated mitochondrial genomes in different mitochondria of the same cell is called heteroplasmy. A minimum number of mutant mtDNAs must be present in a cell to give rise to a disease. This is called the “threshold effect.” Trinucleotide expansion (Option C) is characterized by the amplification of a sequence of three nucleotides. Copy number variation (CNV) (Option A) is a molecular phenomenon in which nuclear genome sequences are repeated, and the number of repeats varies between individuals of the same species. They contribute to human population diversity. Imprinting (Option D) refers to selectively inactivating a gene's maternal or paternal allele, also known as transcriptional silencing.

        "D": "Alzheimer's disease"
      },
      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: A) Fragile X syndrome Explanation: Fragile X Syndrome (FXS) is the most common genetic cause of intellectual disability in males and the second most common cause overall after Down syndrome. It results from a trinucleotide expansion mutation in the FMR1 gene. The FMR1 gene on the X chromosome contains CGG repeats. In FXS, these repeats amplify, leading to a full mutation (200-4000 repeats) in affected individuals. Fragile X–-associated tremor/ataxia syndrome: A progressive neurodegenerative syndrome affecting carrier males, occurs when CGG repeat is between 55-200. Fragile X-associated primary ovarian failure: Premature ovarian failure in carrier females, leading to menstrual irregularities and decreased fertility Intellectual disability: IQ = 20-40 Physical phenotype: Includes a long face with a large mandible, large ears, and macroorchidism (enlarged testicles). Neurological and neuropsychiatric manifestations: Epilepsy, aggressive behavior, autism spectrum disorder, anxiety disorder, and hyperactivity. PCR-based detection of CGG repeats is the method of choice for diagnosis, replacing cytogenetic methods. Reference: Robbins and Cotrans Pathological Basis of diseases, 10th Edition, Pages 174, 176",
