Others: arthritis, fever, lymphadenopathy, neurologic, cardiac, or pulmonary involvement Histology Characterised by foamy macrophages in the small intestinal lamina propria, which contain periodic acid Schiff (PAS)-positive and diastase-resistant granules, representing partially digested bacteria within lysosomes Villous atrophy and blunting of the small intestinal mucosa (Option B) : It is not specific to Whipple's disease. In Whipple's disease, although there can be mucosal changes, the presence of foamy macrophages is more definitive. Lymphoplasmacytic infiltrate in the lamina propria (Option C) : It is not specific to Whipple's disease. While there might be some lymphoplasmacytic infiltrate, it is not the hallmark of Whipple's disease. Presence of caseating granulomas and acid-fast bacilli (Option D) : This finding is characteristic of tuberculosis or other infections caused by mycobacteria, not Whipple's disease. Whipple's disease does not typically present with caseating granulomas or acid-fast bacilli.",

Dysbiosis can lead to alterations in the gut environment, including increased inflammation and impaired barrier function, which may contribute to the progression of IBD.

He reports that he recently returned from a hiking trip in a rural area where he drank water from a nearby stream. On examination, he appears dehydrated but is otherwise stable.

        "D": "Entamoeba histolytica"
      },
      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer:A) Cryptosporidium Explanation: Cryptosporidiosis is a significant cause of diarrhea worldwide. Cryptosporidium is known to cause non-bloody, watery diarrhea and is commonly associated with drinking contaminated water, particularly from untreated sources such as streams or lakes . The presence of oocysts in the stool supports this diagnosis Transmission : Primarily transmitted through contaminated drinking water . Oocysts are resistant to chlorine, persisting in treated but unfiltered water. Less commonly spread via foodborne routes. Species : Key species include C. hominis and C. parvum . All species complete their life cycle in a single host with asexual and sexual phases. Pathophysiology: As few as 10 oocysts can cause symptomatic infection. Sporozoites are released in the intestine and attach to the brush border of enterocytes. Induces changes in the enterocyte cytoskeleton, leading to engulfment. Causes sodium malabsorption , chloride secretion , and increased tight junction permeability . Results in non-bloody, watery diarrhea . Histological Findings : Mucosal histology is often minimally altered. Persistent infections in children or heavy infections in immunocompromised patients can lead to: Villous atrophy Crypt hyperplasia Inflammatory infiltrates Cryptosporidium organisms are seen as small blue spheres that appear to lie on top of the brush border but are actually enveloped by a thin layer of host cell cytoplasm. The small round blue organisms at the lumenal border are Cryptosporidium Diagnosis : Based on the detection of oocysts in stool samples . Most organisms are concentrated in the terminal ileum and proximal colon , but can be found throughout the gut and other sites in immunodeficient hosts. Microsporidium (Option B): This is the incorrect option. While Microsporidia can cause gastrointestinal symptoms, they are more commonly associated with immunocompromised patients and do not typically present with oocysts in stool samples. Microsporidia are smaller and often require specialized staining techniques for diagnosis. Giardia lamblia (Option C): Giardia can also cause non-bloody diarrhea and is associated with contaminated water, but the typical presentation may include foul-smelling stools and more pronounced abdominal discomfort. The diagnosis would be based on cysts or trophozoites rather than oocysts. Entamoeba histolytica (Option D): This organism usually causes dysentery with bloody diarrhea and abdominal pain, which does not fit the clinical presentation in this scenario. The diagnosis would be based on the presence of trophozoites or cysts, not oocysts.",
