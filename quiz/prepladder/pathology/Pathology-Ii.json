        "A": "ATP7B mutation",
        "B": "HFE mutation",
        "C": "SERPINA 1 mutation",
        "D": "UGT1A1 mutation"
      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: B) HFE mutation Explanation: Hereditary hemochromatosis is due to an HFE gene mutation on chromosome 6p that causes excess iron absorption, leading to increased iron deposition. This results in the classic triad of cirrhosis , secondary diabetes mellitus , and bronze skin . Hereditary Hemochromatosis: Key laboratory findings: High ferritin, high serum iron and low TIBC. Liver biopsy: Golden-yellow hemosiderin granules in periportal hepatocytes that appear blue with a Prussian blue stain followed by a micronodular pattern of cirrhosis. Other findings: Dilated cardiomyopathy (m/c cardiac manifestation). Increased risk of hepatocellular carcinoma HJV (Hemojuvelin gene) causes juvenile hemochromatosis. Wilson disease is an autosomal recessive disorder involving the ATP7B gene mutation (Option A) Gilbert syndrome , a harmless autosomal recessive disease, results from UGT1A1 gene mutation ( Option B) α 1-Antitrypsin deficiency is an autosomal recessive disorder occurring due to mutation in SERPINA1 gene leading to pulmonary emphysema and cirrhosis. Liver biopsy shows positive periodic acid-schiff stain and diastase resistance, highlighting the characteristic magenta cytoplasmic granules ( Option C)",

      "question": "A 48-year-old man comes to the OPD with complaints of excessive thirst, excessive micturition, and increased hunger. He also states that his skin colour has changed in the past six months. He is icteric on examination, and his skin examination reveals findings similar to those in the image below. What is the most likely cause of the change in his skin colour?",
      "options": {
        "A": "Excessive melanin production due to adrenal insufficiency",

      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "patient has features of “ Bronze diabetes ” and liver dysfunction, which are typically seen in hemochromatosis. In Hemochromatosis, skin colour changes due to the deposition of excessive melanin >> iron in the skin. It is also known as \"bronze diabetes\" due to skin discolouration and associated pancreatic disease. The disease typically manifests after 20 g of stored iron has accumulated in the body. Organs affected Clinical features Liver Hepatomegaly, elevated liver enzymes, risk of HCC Pancreas Iron induced damage of beta cells - diabetes mellitus",

      "question": "A 38-year-old female presents with fatigue, joint pain, and bronze skin pigmentation. Labs show a heterozygous mutation in the HFE gene. The histopathology image is shown below. Which of the following is the best screening test for this condition?",
      "options": {
        "A": "Serum ferritin level",
        "B": "Transferrin saturation",
        "C": "Liver function tests",
        "D": "Genetic testing for the HFE gene"
      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: B) Transferrin saturation Explanation: The diagnosis in this case is hemochromatosis . Transferrin saturation (TSAT) is the best screening test for hereditary hemochromatosis. TSAT measures the amount of iron bound to transferrin, reflecting the body's iron status. Elevated TSAT levels (>45-50%) suggest iron overload, which is a characteristic feature of hemochromatosis. Serum ferritin is a protein that stores iron in the body. However, while serum ferritin levels can be a useful indicator, they are not as specific as transferrin saturation (TSAT) for diagnosing hemochromatosis (Option A) . In hereditary hemochromatosis, LFTs may show abnormalities in advanced stages of the disease when iron overload has caused liver damage (e.g., elevated alanine transaminase or AST levels). However, LFTs are not specific screening tests for hemochromatosis (Option C) . Genetic testing for mutations in the HFE gene is the definitive diagnostic test for hereditary hemochromatosis (Option D) .

        "D": "Horner's syndrome"
      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: B ) Kayser-Fleischer rings Explanation: The image shows characteristic Kayser-Fleischer rings, a brownish-green discolouration in the cornea. These rings are associated with Wilson's disease, a genetic disorder involving copper metabolism. Wilson's disease is a genetic disorder characterised by impaired copper metabolism. It leads to copper accumulation primarily in the liver, brain, and other organs. Molecular genetic testing can identify mutations in the ATP7B gene, which is responsible for Wilson's disease. Clinical Features: Kayser-Fleischer Rings: These are characteristic brownish-green rings seen in the cornea due to copper deposition and are a hallmark feature of Wilson's disease. Serum copper is raised, while ceruloplasmin levels (a copper-binding protein) are decreased in Wilson's disease. Increased urinary copper excretion is a characteristic finding in Wilson's disease. Arcus senilis refers to a white or greyish ring around the cornea that is commonly seen in elderly individuals. It is caused by lipid deposits in the peripheral cornea and is generally considered a normal age-related change. ( Option A) Roth spots are retinal haemorrhages with a white or pale centre. Roth spots can be seen in various medical conditions, including bacterial endocarditis, leukemia, and diabetic retinopathy ( Option C) Horner's syndrome is a clinical syndrome characterised by a triad of eye and face symptoms. It includes ptosis (drooping of the upper eyelid), miosis (constriction of the pupil), and anhidrosis (decreased sweating) on the affected side of the face ( Option D)",

      "explanation": "Correct Answer: C) Rubeanic acid stain Explanation: The Rubeanic acid stain, also known as the Rhodanine stain, is commonly used to detect copper accumulation in liver tissue, particularly in the hepatocytes' cytoplasmic granules. This stain forms a distinctive brown-black color when it reacts with copper, aiding in the diagnosis of Wilson's disease.

      "explanation": "Correct Answer: C) Nutmeg Liver Explanation: The patient's history of chronic alcohol abuse and the characteristic mottled appearance of the liver on imaging studies point towards Nutmeg Liver as the most likely diagnosis. Nutmeg liver, also known as congestive hepatopathy or passive hepatic congestion, is a condition characterized by a mottled appearance of the liver on imaging studies, resembling the cross-section of a nutmeg seed.

Alpha-1 Antitrypsin ( α 1AT ) deficiency is an autosomal recessive (AR) disorder with defective gene in Chromosome 14 - SERPINA1 gene In Alpha-1 Antitrypsin Deficiency (AATD), there is a deficiency or dysfunction of α 1AT, leading to decreased inhibition of neutrophil elastase . This results in uncontrolled protease activity , particularly neutrophil elastase, which can cause tissue damage, especially in the lungs and liver leading to pan-acinar emphysema and liver cirrhosis respectively Histopathology: The deficiency is characterised by the presence of round-to-oval cytoplasmic globular inclusions in hepatocytes, which are strongly periodic acid–Schiff (PAS)-positive and diastase-resistant.",
