      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: B) Muscle intimal elastic lamina layer defect Explanation: Berry aneurysms , also known as saccular aneurysms or intracranial aneurysms, most commonly occur due to a defect in the muscle intimal elastic lamina layer of the blood vessel wall. This defect weakens the vessel wall, leading to the formation of a small outpouching or sac-like dilation. These aneurysms are frequently found in the arteries at the base of the brain, particularly at the branching points of the major cerebral arteries. Endothelial injury of vessels due to hypertension (Option A): While hypertension can contribute to the development and progression of aneurysms, it is not the most common cause of berry aneurysms. Muscle and adventitial layer defect (Option C) and Adventitia defect (Option D) : Berry aneurysms primarily involve the defect in the muscle intimal elastic lamina layer.

      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: A) Alzheimer’s Disease Explanation: The fundamental abnormality in Alzheimer’s disease is the accumulation of two proteins (A β and tau) in specific brain regions in the form of plaques and tangles. Morphology of Alzheimer’s disease: Gross: Cortical atrophy (narrowed gyri and widened sulci) is predominant in the frontal, temporal, and parietal lobes. Histology: Plaques Deposits of A β peptides in the neuropil. They are of two types: Diffuse and neuritic (senile). Neuritic plaques contain both A β 40 and A β 42. Diffuse plaques are predominantly made up of A β 42 and seen in trisomy 21 patients. Tangles Aggregates of the microtubule-binding protein tau. Demonstrated by silver (Bielschowsky) staining. Commonly found in cortical neurons, especially in the entorhinal cortex, and in other sites such as pyramidal cells of the hippocampus, amygdala, basal forebrain, and raphe nuclei. Hirano bodies Intracellular eosinophilic inclusions are typically found in conditions like Alzheimer's disease and Creutzfeldt–Jakob disease. Granulovacuolar degeneration Formation of small, clear vacuoles within the neurons. Plaques Neurofibrillary tangles Hirano bodies Granulovacuolar degeneration Huntington's Disease (Option B) is characterised by toxic gain-of-function of mutant huntingtin protein and neuronal loss in the striatum. Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS) (Option C) involves the degeneration of motor neurons, often linked to superoxide dismutase 1 (SOD1) mutations or TDP-43 protein inclusions. CNS Lymphoma (Option D) is a type of brain tumour originating from lymphocytes (B cells) and is unrelated to tau protein.",

      "explanation": "Correct Answer: C) Meningioma Explanation: Meningiomas are tumours originating from the meninges , the protective membranes covering the brain and spinal cord. They are not derived from glial cells but rather from the arachnoid cap cells of the meninges . Incorrect Options: Astrocytoma (Option A) is a GFAP-positive glial cell tumour and the most common primary brain tumour in children. Histologically, it features densely packed elongated cells with round to oval nuclei and prominent nucleoli. Medulloblastoma (Option B) are embryonal tumours that develop from undifferentiated neuroepithelial cells in the cerebellum . They are not derived from glial cells but instead from primitive neuroectodermal cells . It is the most common malignant tumour in children. Ependymoma (Option D) arises from ependymal cells lining the ventricular system or spinal cord. It is commonly seen in the fourth ventricle in children and in the spinal cord in adults . Histologically, it is characterised by perivascular pseudorosettes , where tumour cells are arranged around blood vessels, and ependymal rosettes , where cells form true rosettes with a central lumen.",

        "D": "Glioma"
      },
      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: A) Schwannoma Explanation: Schwannoma is a benign tumour of the peripheral nerve sheath, characterised by spindle-shaped cells with palisading nuclei and Verocay bodies, which are pathognomonic. Schwannomas are benign tumours originating from Schwann cells, often linked to mutations in the NF2 gene. These tumours are well-circumscribed, encapsulated, and typically attached loosely to nerves, allowing for surgical removal without damaging nerve function. They appear as firm, grey masses. Histology: Antoni A areas : Dense eosinophilic regions with spindle cells in intersecting fascicles. Antoni B areas : Looser, hypocellular regions with a myxoid extracellular matrix. Verocay bodies : Structures with central \"nuclear-free zones\" surrounded by palisading nuclei. Schwann cells show spindle-shaped nuclei and immunoreactivity for S-100. Degenerative changes: Nuclear pleomorphism, xanthomatous change, and necrosis can occur. Malignant transformation is rare, but large mitotically active schwannomas can resemble sarcomas. Other features: Schwannomas may recur if incompletely resected but rarely transform malignantly. They can arise from sensory nerves, including branches of the trigeminal nerve or dorsal roots, and can occur both within and outside the nerve trunk. Surgical removal is typically curative. Neurofibroma (Option B) are benign tumours that develop from peripheral nerves. They are composed of a mix of Schwann cells, fibroblasts, and other cellular components. Histologically, neurofibromas have a more varied appearance than schwannomas, with multiple cell types and no presence of Verocay bodies. Neuroma (Option C) is an abnormal growth of nerve tissue caused by nerve injury or trauma. They are characterised by disorganised nerve fibres and can lead to symptoms such as pain, tingling, and sensory disturbances. Glioma (Option D) are tumours that arise from glial cells in the central nervous system.",

      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: B) Alzheimer’s disease Explanation: Parkinson's disease, Lewy body dementia, and multisystem atrophy are all associated with alpha-synuclein pathology, specifically the formation of Lewy bodies in the brain. In contrast, Alzheimer's disease is primarily characterized by the accumulation of amyloid plaques and neurofibrillary tangles of tau protein, representing a different core pathology. Parkinson’s Disease (PD): Genetic Basis: Autosomal Dominant PD: Caused by mutations in SNCA, which encodes α -synuclein, the key component of Lewy bodies. Autosomal Recessive PD: Linked to mutations in DJ-1, PINK1, and Parkin. Most Common Autosomal Dominant Mutation: LRRK2 (Leucine-Rich Repeat Kinase 2). Clinical Features: Triad of Tremor, rigidity, and bradykinesia. Morphology: Gross pathology: Pallor of the substantia nigra due to neuronal loss. Microscopic features: Lewy bodies: Cytoplasmic, eosinophilic inclusions, either single or multiple. Structure: Dense core surrounded by a pale halo. Ultrastructure: Composed of fine filaments of α -synuclein.

      "explanation": "Correct Answer: C) Psammoma bodies with whorling of tumour cells Explanation: The patient’s presentation of a dural-based tumour with raised intracranial pressure suggests a diagnosis of meningioma, and the histological feature of psammoma bodies with whorling of tumour cells is a characteristic finding. They originate from meningothelial cells of the arachnoid layer and are typically connected to the dura mater. More common in women and has increased risk with pregnancy , exposure to radiation and NF2 gene mutation. Tumours typically exhibit a rubbery dural mass, compressing the brain, yet easily separable. Histopathologically, they present with a whorled pattern of cells and psammoma bodies and are progesterone receptor-positive . Incorrect Options: Fried-egg appearance (Option A) is characteristic of oligodendrogliomas along with chicken wire vessels, calcification and perineuronal satellitosis. Flexner-Wintersteiner rosettes (Option B) are composed of an ‘empty’ lumen surrounded by columnar cells and are seen in retinoblastomas , along with Homer-Wright rosettes , undifferentiated tumour cells and areas of necrosis and calcification.

Glioblastomas often have a rapid growth rate and infiltrative behavior and tend to be resistant to conventional treatments. The symptoms mentioned in the question, such as severe headaches, seizures, and progressive neurological deficits, are characteristic of glioblastoma due to its invasive nature and effect on brain function. Glioblastoma accounts for about 80% of primary brain tumors in adults. Incorrect Options: Option A - Medulloblastoma: Medulloblastoma is a type of malignant brain tumor, but it is more commonly found in children rather than adults. It usually arises in the cerebellum, which is the part of the brain responsible for coordinating movement. Option B - Meningioma: Meningiomas are generally benign tumors that arise from the meninges, which are the protective layers surrounding the brain and spinal cord. While they can occur in adults, they are usually slow-growing and tend to be less aggressive than glioblastomas.

      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: A) Retinoblastoma Explanation: The presence of a lesion in the right eye and histopathological findings of Flexner-Wintersteiner rosettes strongly suggest a diagnosis of Retinoblastoma . Retinoblastoma It is caused by the inactivation of both alleles of the RB1 tumour suppressor gene. Types Heritable (germline): It frequently leads to bilateral retinoblastoma and is caused by a germline mutation in the RB1 gene in all cells, followed by a somatic mutation in the retinal cells. Affected individuals are also at increased risk for developing non-ocular tumours, such as osteosarcoma. Non-heritable (sporadic): This form typically presents as a unilateral tumour and results from two somatic mutations in the retinal cells occurring after embryonic development, without a germline mutation. It is not inherited and does not carry an increased risk of developing non-ocular tumours. Clinical features Occurs in young children, usually before 5 years of age ( most common ocular neoplasm in children ). Leukocoria: White pupillary reflex (most common presenting sign of retinoblastoma). Strabismus Painful red eye Poor vision Asymptomatic Fundus examination A white, elevated mass in the retina is characteristic of retinoblastoma Genetic testing RB1 gene mutation on chromosome 13q14 Histopathology Flexner-Wintersteiner rosettes (highly specific) : These are composed of an ‘empty’ lumen surrounded by columnar cells.

Symptoms may include vision loss, proptosis, and visual field defects. It typically occurs along the optic nerve and does not exhibit Flexner-Wintersteiner rosettes. Rhabdomyosarcoma (Option C) is a malignant soft tissue sarcoma that originates from skeletal muscle cells or their precursors. It is most common in children and can occur in various locations, including the head and neck, genitourinary tract, and extremities. Symptoms depend on the tumour's location but often include a painless mass or swelling. It affects the eye but does not show these characteristic rosettes. Ocular melanoma (Option D) is a rare malignant tumour that develops in the pigment-producing cells (melanocytes) of the eye, most commonly in the choroid (part of the eye's vascular layer). It is more common in adults and can lead to symptoms like vision changes, dark spots in the field of vision, and proptosis.",

        "D": "Adventitia defect"
      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "saccular aneurysms or intracranial aneurysms, most commonly occur due to a defect in the muscle intimal elastic lamina layer of the blood vessel wall. This defect weakens the vessel wall, leading to the formation of a small outpouching or sac-like dilation. These aneurysms are frequently found in the arteries at the base of the brain, particularly at the branching points of the major cerebral arteries. Incorrect Options: Option A - Endothelial injury of vessel due to hypertension: While hypertension can contribute to the development and progression of aneurysms, it is not the most common cause of berry aneurysms. Option C - Muscle and adventitial layer defect: Berry aneurysms primarily involve the defect in the muscle intimal elastic lamina layer. Option D - Adventitia defect: Berry aneurysms primarily involve the defect in the muscle intimal elastic lamina layer. Reference: Prepladder Notes",
