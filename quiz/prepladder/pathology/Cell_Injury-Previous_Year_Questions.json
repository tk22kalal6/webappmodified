      "correct_answer": "D",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: D) 1, 2 and 4 Explanation: Amyloidosis is a group of disorders characterized by the extracellular deposition of amyloid fibrils that are produced by the aggregation of misfolded proteins. (Statement 4) The presence of abundant charged sugar groups in these adsorbed proteins gives the deposits staining characteristics that were thought to resemble starch (amylose). Therefore, the deposits were called amyloid (Statement 1). 95% of amyloid consists of fibril proteins, with the remaining 5% being glycosaminoglycans (dermatan sulfate and heparan sulfate) and plasma proteins, notably serum amyloid P . AL amyloidosis is a primary form of amyloidosis, whereas secondary form can be caused by various etiologies and is associated with characteristic amyloid deposition (Statement 3). Physical nature of amyloid: Light microscopy with H & E stains: Amyloid is an amorphous , eosinophilic , hyaline , and extracellular substance. Electron microscopy: All types of amyloid, regardless of clinical setting or chemical composition, consist of continuous, nonbranching fibrils with a diameter of approximately 7.5 to 10 nm. X-ray crystallography and infrared spectroscopy: Characteristic cross- β -pleated sheet conformation, which is responsible for the distinctive Congo-red staining and apple-green birefringence of the amyloid.

      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "tissue is a type of connective tissue that forms during the healing process of a wound. It is composed of new blood vessels (angiogenesis), fibroblasts, and an extracellular matrix. Granulation tissue fills the wound defect and helps in the formation of new tissue. It appears as red, soft, and granular tissue on the wound surface. Incorrect options: Option A: Granuloma formation: Granuloma formation is a type of chronic inflammation characterized by the aggregation of immune cells, typically macrophages, in response to persistent or resistant antigens. It is not the primary mechanism involved in the healing of the described wound. Option B: Scab formation: Scab formation occurs during the initial stages of wound healing when blood components, such as fibrin and platelets, dry and form a protective crust over the wound. It is not the primary mechanism involved in the healing process after incision and drainage of an infected scalp swelling. Option D: Neovascularization: Neovascularization refers to the formation of new blood vessels. It is an important step in wound healing, but in the context of the described case, granulation tissue formation is a more relevant mechanism for healing. Reference: .",

        "D": "Lectin receptor"
      },
      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: C) MHC Explanation: Antigen-presenting cells (APCs) such as dendritic cells, macrophages, and B cells play a crucial role in the adaptive immune response by presenting antigens to T-helper (TH2) cells . This process requires Major Histocompatibility Complex (MHC) Class II molecules , which are essential for the activation of CD4+ T cells, including TH2 cells. MHC Molecule Role : APCs process antigens and present them on their surface bound to MHC Class II molecules. MHC Class II molecules interact with the T-cell receptor (TCR) on CD4+ T cells. This interaction is critical for the differentiation and activation of TH2 cells, which secrete cytokines to mediate humoral immunity. Incorrect Options: NK cells (Option A) are part of the innate immune system and do not present antigens or directly interact with TH2 cells. G-protein coupled receptors (Option B) are involved in cell signalling but are not involved in antigen presentation to T cells. Lectin receptors (Option D) are involved in innate immune recognition, particularly of carbohydrate molecules, but they do not mediate antigen presentation to TH2 cells.

        "B": "Caspase 8",
        "C": "Caspase 9",
        "D": "Caspase 4"
      },
      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: C) Caspase 9 Explanation: In the intrinsic apoptotic pathway , the release of cytochrome c (Cyt c) from the mitochondria triggers the formation of the apoptosome, a complex consisting of Cyt c, apoptotic protease-activating factor 1 (APAF-1), and procaspase 9. This complex is essential for initiating the caspase cascade that leads to cell death. Apoptosis (Caspase-dependent programmed cell death): Apoptosis is a type of cell death that is induced by a tightly regulated suicide program in which cells destined to die activate intrinsic enzymes that degrade the cells’ genomic DNA and nuclear and cytoplasmic proteins. It is an active process. It eliminates cells that are injured beyond repair without eliciting a host reaction, thus limiting collateral tissue damage. Apoptosis results from activating enzymes called caspases, leading to DNA fragmentation. The process of apoptosis may be divided into an initiation phase , during which caspases 8,9,10 become catalytically active and unleash a cascade of other caspases, and an execution phase , during which the terminal caspases 3,6,7 trigger cellular fragmentation. Morphological features:- Cell shrinkage Chromatin condensation Formation of cytoplasmic blebs and apoptotic bodies Phagocytosis of apoptotic bodies, usually by macrophages. Histopathology: In H&E-stained tissue, the apoptotic cell appears as a round or oval mass of intensely eosinophilic cytoplasm with fragments of dense nuclear chromatin. The above image shows apoptosis of an epidermal cell in an immune reaction. The cell is reduced in size and contains brightly eosinophilic cytoplasm and a condensed nucleus Types: Apoptosis occurs in two broad contexts: Physiological apoptosis. Pathological apoptosis. Apoptosis in physiological conditions Apoptosis in pathological conditions 1. The removal of supernumerary cells (in excess of the required number) during development. 2. Involution of hormone-dependent tissues on hormone withdrawal, such as endometrial cell breakdown during the menstrual cycle. 3. Elimination of potentially harmful self-reactive lymphocytes to prevent immune reactions against one’s own tissues. 4. Death of host cells that have served their useful purpose, such as neutrophils in an acute inflammatory response and lymphocytes at the end of an immune response. 1. DNA damage. 2. Accumulation of misfolded proteins 3. Apoptosis can be induced during infections such as adenovirus , HIV , and viral hepatitis . 4. It may also contribute to pathologic atrophy in parenchymal organs after duct obstruction, such as occurs in the pancreas, parotid gland, and kidney",

        "A": "Glutaraldehyde",
        "B": "Formaldehyde",
        "C": "Methanol",
        "D": "Osmium tetroxide"
      },
      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: C) Methanol Explanation: Methanol is not a crosslinking fixative. It is a dehydrant coagulant fixative. Fixatives are chemicals that preserve biological tissues by stabilizing cellular structures and preventing decay or degradation. The goal is to maintain the tissue in a life-like state as much as possible for microscopic examination. Fixation helps maintain the tissue's integrity by preventing autolysis (self-digestion) and putrefaction (bacterial decay). Crosslinking Fixatives: These fixatives work by forming covalent bonds between the proteins and other cellular structures, effectively \"locking\" them in place. This preserves the tissue’s structural integrity. Formaldehyde (Option B) : Most commonly used in the form of 10% neutral-buffered formalin. Glutaraldehyde (Option A) : Often used for electron microscopy due to its ability to preserve fine cellular structures. Osmium tetroxide (Option D) : Used primarily for electron microscopy, particularly for preserving lipids and membranes. Precipitating Fixatives: These work by precipitating proteins and other cellular components, which makes them less soluble and helps preserve their structure. Methanol Ethanol Additive Fixatives: They chemically bind to tissue components, such as proteins or nucleic acids, and stabilize them. They are typically more gentle and produce better preservation of ultrastructure.

      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: A) Intermediate filaments Explanation: The presence of intracytoplasmic eosinophilic inclusions in hepatocytes is a key finding in alcoholic liver disease. Mallory-Denk bodies or Mallory hyaline bodies are eosinophilic , intracytoplasmic inclusions composed of intermediate filaments, particularly cytokeratin 8 and 18, commonly seen in hepatocytes in conditions such as alcoholic liver disease.

      },
      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: A) Anthracotic pigment Explanation: Anthracotic pigment is a black, carbon-based pigment commonly seen in lymph nodes and lungs, as well as in individuals with chronic smoking or environmental pollution exposure. These particles are engulfed by macrophages in the lungs and then transported to nearby lymph nodes, often leading to anthracosis . HPE shows carbon-laden macrophages. In patients with lung cancer , particularly squamous cell carcinoma , the presence of hilar lymphadenopathy and black pigment is a common finding due to the direct proximity of the lungs and lymphatic drainage of carbon particles. Melanin (Option B) is responsible for skin and hair pigmentation and protects against UV radiation. While it can sometimes be found in melanomas (a type of skin cancer), it is not typically found in the lungs or lymph nodes. Lipochrome (Option C) is a group of yellow to brown pigments that arise from the breakdown of lipids (fats). On microscopy, it appears as a yellow-brown, finely granular cytoplasmic pigment, often deposited in the perinuclear location. These pigments can be found in various tissues but are not typically associated with lung diseases or lymph node involvement . Hemosiderin (Option D) is an iron-containing pigment derived from the breakdown of hemoglobin . While hemosiderin can appear brown, it does not appear as a black pigment in the context of smoking-related lung disease or cancer .",

        "C": "Hypovolemic shock",
        "D": "Neurogenic shock"
      },
      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: C) Hypovolemic shock Explanation: Hypovolemic shock occurs due to significant blood or fluid loss, leading to reduced blood volume and inadequate tissue perfusion. This patient’s low blood pressure, tachycardia, cold, clammy skin, and metabolic acidosis suggest shock caused by blood loss from the ruptured spleen. Shock is a state of circulatory failure that impairs tissue perfusion and leads to cellular hypoxia. Initially, cellular injury is reversible, but prolonged shock can cause irreversible tissue damage and may be fatal. It can result from various conditions, such as severe haemorrhage, extensive trauma, burns, myocardial infarction, pulmonary embolism, and microbial sepsis. The causes of shock can be categorised into three main types: Cardiogenic shock: (Option A) Caused by low cardiac output due to myocardial pump failure. This may result from intrinsic myocardial damage (e.g., infarction), ventricular arrhythmias, extrinsic compression (e.g., cardiac tamponade), or outflow obstruction (e.g., pulmonary embolism). Hypovolemic shock: Occurs due to low blood volume, often from massive haemorrhage or fluid loss (e.g., severe burns). This leads to reduced cardiac output and impaired tissue perfusion. Septic shock: (Option B) Sepsis : Life-threatening organ dysfunction due to a dysregulated host response to infection. Septic Shock : A subset of sepsis with profound circulatory, cellular, and metabolic abnormalities that increase mortality risk. Systemic Inflammatory Response Syndrome (SIRS) : A sepsis-like condition triggered by non-microbial insults, such as burns, trauma, or pancreatitis. Both SIRS and septic shock are marked by a massive release of inflammatory mediators, causing arterial vasodilation, vascular leakage, and venous blood pooling, leading to tissue hypoperfusion, cellular hypoxia, and organ dysfunction. Neurogenic Shock (Option D) : Occurs following spinal cord injury, leading to acute vasodilation and hypotension. Anaphylactic Shock : Caused by an IgE-mediated hypersensitivity reaction, resulting in acute vasodilation, hypotension, and tissue hypoperfusion.

      },
      "correct_answer": "D",
      "explanation": "appearance. Entosis : It refers to a homotypic process where one epithelial cell invades the cytoplasm of another epithelial cell. The host cell forms a vacuole around the internalized cell, which deforms its organelles, including the nucleus. The inner cell may survive within the host cell for up to 12 hours or longer, eventually being digested by the outer cell through an autophagosomal mechanism, or it may escape. Necrosis (Option A) is an uncontrolled form of cell death characterized by cell swelling, rupture, and inflammation. Apoptosis (Option B) is a controlled, programmed cell death where cells shrink and fragment into apoptotic bodies. Necroptosis (Option C) is a form of regulated cell death that mimics necrosis but is genetically controlled. Unlike apoptosis, it is associated with inflammation and occurs via receptor-interacting protein kinases (RIPK1 and RIPK3), leading to membrane rupture and the release of intracellular contents.

      "correct_answer": "D",
      "explanation": "cerebral blood flow due to atherosclerosis causes senile atrophy of the brain. Loss of innervation (denervation atrophy) (Option A) : Skeletal muscle metabolism and function rely on nerve supply. Damage to the nerves results in atrophy of the muscle fibres they innervate. Inadequate nutrition (Option B) : Severe protein-calorie malnutrition, such as marasmus , causes the breakdown of skeletal muscle proteins for energy after fat stores are depleted, leading to muscle wasting (cachexia) . This is common in chronic inflammatory diseases and cancer. In cachectic states, excessive TNF production contributes to appetite suppression and lipid depletion, further exacerbating muscle atrophy. Decreased workload (disuse atrophy) (Option C) : Immobilization of bones, such as through a plaster cast or prolonged bed rest, leads to rapid muscle atrophy. Initially, the decrease in cell size is reversible upon resumption of activity. However, with prolonged disuse, muscle fibres shrink in size and number (due to apoptosis), and muscle atrophy may be accompanied by increased bone resorption, resulting in disuse osteoporosis.

Cell swelling occurs because of the loss of cellular integrity and failure of ion pumps (such as the Na+/K+ ATPase pump), leading to an influx of water into the cell. In necrosis, the plasma membrane of the cell is disrupted , allowing the release of intracellular contents. The released substances trigger an immune response, leading to an inflammatory reaction, which is a characteristic of necrosis.

      "explanation": "Correct Answer: A) Creutzfelt Jakob disease Explanation: Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD) is a type of prion disease caused by the abnormal folding of proteins, specifically prion proteins (PrP), which leads to neurodegeneration. It is irreversible and fatal . The disease progresses quickly, and death usually occurs within a year. It is characterised by Rapidly progressive dementia Myoclonus Ataxia Visual disturbances Diagnosis: It is confirmed via MRI (increased signal in basal ganglia) and EEG findings Cirrhosis (Option B) is liver scarring typically caused by chronic liver diseases (e.g., hepatitis, alcoholism), not protein misfolding. Nephritic syndrome (Option C) is a kidney disorder involving inflammation, typically due to immune complex deposition, not protein misfolding. Sickle cell anaemia (Option D) is caused by a genetic mutation in the haemoglobin gene (HbS) that leads to abnormal haemoglobin, but not a misfolding of proteins in the same sense as prion diseases.

      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: A) Include cytoplasm + intranuclear material + organelle Explanation: Apoptotic bodies are comprised of cytoplasm, intranuclear material and cellular organelles. Apoptosis (caspase-dependent programmed cell death): It is a type of cell death that is induced by a tightly regulated suicide program in which cells destined to die activate intrinsic enzymes that degrade the cells’ genomic DNA and nuclear and cytoplasmic proteins. It is an active process. It eliminates cells that are injured beyond repair without eliciting a host reaction, thus limiting collateral tissue damage. Apoptosis results from the activation of enzymes called caspases, which leads to DNA fragmentation. The process of apoptosis may be divided into: Initiation phase: Caspases 8,9,10 become catalytically active and unleash a cascade of other caspase Execution phase: During which the terminal caspases 3,6,7 trigger cellular fragmentation. Morphological features:- Cell shrinkage Chromatin condensation Formation of cytoplasmic blebs and apoptotic bodies (cytoplasm and tightly packed organelles, with or without nuclear fragments) (Option A) Phagocytosis of apoptotic bodies, usually by macrophages. Histopathology: The apoptotic cell appears as a round or oval mass of intensely eosinophilic cytoplasm with fragments of dense nuclear chromatin. The cell is reduced in size and contains brightly eosinophilic cytoplasm and a condensed nucleus. Types: Apoptosis occurs in two broad contexts: Physiological apoptosis. Pathological apoptosis. Physiological Apoptosis Pathological Apoptosis The removal of supernumerary cells (in excess of the required number) during development. Involution of hormone-dependent tissues on hormone withdrawal, such as endometrial cell breakdown during the menstrual cycle. Elimination of potentially harmful self-reactive lymphocytes to prevent immune reactions against one’s own tissues. Death of host cells that have served their useful purpose, such as neutrophils in an acute inflammatory response and lymphocytes at the end of an immune response. DNA damage. Accumulation of misfolded proteins Apoptosis can be induced during certain infections- as in adenovirus and HIV infections and viral hepatitis. It may also contribute to pathologic atrophy in parenchymal organs after duct obstruction, such as occurs in the pancreas, parotid gland, and kidney.",
