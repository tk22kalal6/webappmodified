      "question": "Which of the following statements about rheumatic heart disease (RHD) is incorrect?",
      "options": {
        "A": "An abnormal immune response to Group A Streptococcus infection causes RHD.",
        "B": "RHD commonly affects the pulmonary valve, resulting in valvular stenosis or regurgitation.",
        "C": "Chronic inflammation and scarring of heart valves.",
        "D": "Prevented with timely treatment of streptococcal infections with antibiotics."
      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "regurgitation. Correct Answer: B) RHD commonly affects the pulmonary valve, resulting in valvular stenosis or regurgitation. Explanation: Pulmonary is the least common valve affected by rheumatic heart disease (RHD). The mitral valve is most commonly affected. RHD is a condition that develops as a complication of untreated or inadequately treated acute rheumatic fever (ARF), which is caused by an abnormal immune response to an infection with Group A beta-hemolytic Streptococcus bacteria (aka Streptococcus pyogenes) (Option A is ruled out). Group A Streptococcus M protein resembles human cardiac tissues, leading to autoimmune attack on heart valves. The bacteria trigger an immune response that leads to chronic inflammation and scarring of heart valves (Option C is ruled out) , commonly affecting the mitral valve. Cross-Immunity: Different serotypes of Group A Streptococcus have variable M proteins, so previous infection does not provide complete immunity, making recurrent streptococcal infections a risk for repeated rheumatic fever episodes and progressive RHD. Early treatment of streptococcal infections with antibiotics can help prevent initial rheumatic fever and subsequent rheumatic heart disease (Option D is ruled out) . However, once RHD is established, ongoing cardiac monitoring and sometimes surgical intervention are needed to manage valve damage and related complications.

      "question": "A 10-year-old child presents to the clinic with complaints of shortness of breath and fatigue. Upon examination, a diastolic murmur along the left sternal border is detected. An echocardiogram reveals mitral valve stenosis and regurgitation, consistent with Rheumatic heart disease (RHD). What is the most common predisposing condition for this patient to develop RHD?",

        "D": "All the above"
      },
      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: A) Streptococcal pharyngitis Explanation: The primary predisposing factor for RHD, an autoimmune inflammatory disorder, is Streptococcal Pharyngitis, commonly caused by Group A beta-hemolytic Streptococci (Strains 1, 3, 5, 6, 18). This bacterial infection can lead to acute rheumatic fever, typically developing 2-3 weeks after the onset of streptococcal pharyngitis, eventually progressing to RHD. The most commonly affected age group is 5-15 years. Streptococcal skin infections (Option B) (e.g., impetigo) can also be associated with rheumatic fever but are less commonly a trigger for rheumatic heart disease than pharyngitis. Streptococcal glomerulonephritis (Option C) is a type 3 hypersensitivity reaction that can arise from either skin or throat infections but is not typically linked to the development of rheumatic heart disease.

      "question": "A 7-year-old child presented to the clinic with fever, joint pain, and rash with a history of sore throat about three weeks ago, which resolved without treatment. Examination reveals a rash characterized by pink to red lesions with well-defined borders and tender, swollen joints. What is the primary mechanism underlying the development of acute rheumatic fever (ARF) in this patient following the untreated sore throat?",
      "options": {
        "A": "Direct invasion of tissues by streptococcal bacteria",
        "B": "Delayed hypersensitivity reaction to streptococcal exotoxins",
        "C": "Cross-reactivity between streptococcal antigens and host proteins",
        "D": "Activation of complement by streptococcal toxins"
      },
      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: C) Cross-reactivity between streptococcal antigens and host proteins Explanation: Acute rheumatic fever (ARF) results from an immune response to group A streptococcal antigens, particularly the M proteins (cell wall proteins), which can cross-react with host proteins, including cardiac self-antigens. This molecular mimicry produces antibodies and activates CD4+ T cells that ultimately cause inflammation and tissue damage, particularly in the heart. Streptococci are not directly involved in the lesions observed in ARF, highlighting the disease's autoimmune nature. It is a Type II hypersensitivity reaction.

      "correct_answer": "D",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: D) Presence of granulation tissue Explanation: The patient's presentation with a history of recurrent sore throat in childhood and evidence of mitral valve prolapse suggests the possibility of rheumatic heart disease (RHD). Histopathological features of RHD: Aschoff bodies are focal areas of inflammation with infiltration of lymphocytes, plasma cells and activated macrophages or histiocytes. (Option B) An endomyocardial biopsy showing Aschoff bodies helps in confirming the diagnosis of RHD. Anitschkow cells or Caterpillar cells (Option A) are activated macrophages with elongated and wavy nuclei commonly found within Aschoff bodies. Fibrinoid necrosis (Option C) is seen in areas of the valves affected by inflammation. Note: Granulation tissue is seen in cases of repair. It comprises proliferating blood vessels, inflammatory cells and fibroblasts.",

      "correct_answer": "D",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: D) Subcutaneous nodules over bony prominences Explanation: Jones' criteria help identify and diagnose ARF in individuals with a history of preceding streptococcal pharyngitis. Subcutaneous nodules are small, painless nodules located under the skin over the bony prominences on the extensor surfaces of the extremities. They are considered a major criterion in the Jones criteria for diagnosing acute rheumatic fever. Jones criteria for diagnosing acute rheumatic fever (ARF): Major criteria Minor criteria Clinical or subclinical evidence of carditis (e.g., new murmur) Migratory polyarthritis (Two or more joints involved) Sydenham chorea (involuntary movements) Erythema marginatum (characteristic skin rash) Subcutaneous nodules (Option D) Previous rheumatic fever or rheumatic heart disease Fever ( ≥ 38.5°C) (Option B) Poly or mono arthralgia (Option A) Elevated acute phase reactants (e.g., CRP, ESR) (Option C) Prolonged PR interval on ECG The presence of two major criteria, or one major criterion + two minor criteria (along with evidence of preceding streptococcal infection), supports the diagnosis of acute rheumatic fever (ARF) according to the Jones criteria.

        "D": "Enterococci"
      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: B) Streptococcus viridans Explanation: The presence of gram-positive cocci in chains in blood cultures suggests an infection with a streptococcal species. Streptococcus viridans is a commensal organism found in the oral cavity, upper respiratory tract, and gastrointestinal tract . While normally harmless, it can enter the bloodstream after dental procedures or mucosal injury , leading to subacute infective endocarditis in individuals with underlying valve abnormalities like mitral valve prolapse . Its ability to produce dextran helps in adherence to damaged heart valves, facilitating infection. Streptococcus viridans is the most common cause of “Native valve endocarditis” (previously damaged or abnormal heart valves), characterised by relatively low virulence but less commonly associated with prosthetic valve endocarditis.

      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: C) Prone to embolisation Explanation: Vegetations in infective endocarditis are friable, bulky lesions containing fibrin, inflammatory cells, and bacteria or other organisms. These vegetations are commonly found on the atrial side of leaflets, and can damage cordae tendinae and papillary muscles. They are ‘prone to embolisation’, leading to the formation of septic infarcts or mycotic aneurysms at sites where embolic fragments lodge. This embolic process contributes to the systemic complications associated with Infective endocarditis. Reference: Robbins and Cotran Pathologic Basis of Disease, 10th edition, Pages 563-564",

      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: C) Janeway lesions Explanation: The given clinical scenario suggests Infectious endocarditis (IE) occurred as a complication of Rheumatic Heart Disease (RHD). The clinical finding shown in the image is ‘Janeway lesions’ seen in Infective endocarditis, which are painless erythematous or hemorrhagic lesions on the palms or soles resulting from septic microemboli affecting the small blood vessels in the skin. Splinter hemorrhages (Option A) are small linear hemorrhages under the fingernails associated with infective endocarditis (IE). These hemorrhages are caused by microemboli or trauma to the small blood vessels. Osler nodes (Option B) tender subcutaneous nodules associated with IE, typically found in the pulp of the digits. They result from immune complex deposition in the small blood vessels. Pain is due to deposition of immune complexes in the glomus apparatus of the dermis, which is densely packed in the digit Roth spots (Option D) are ocular manifestations of infective endocarditis (IE), characterized by retinal hemorrhages with pale centers. They develop when emboli become lodged in retinal blood vessels. Roth spots are not specific to IE and are also seen in other conditions like",
