        "A": "Squamous cell carcinoma",
        "B": "Merkel cell carcinoma",
        "C": "Basal cell carcinoma",

      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "originating in the basal cells of the skin. BCC is usually localized to the site of origin and tends to grow slowly. While it can invade and damage nearby tissues if left untreated, it has a low potential for metastasis. BCC rarely spreads to lymph nodes or distant organs through the lymphatic or bloodstream routes, making it less likely to disseminate through the lymphatic system compared to SCC, MCC, or malignant melanoma. Incorrect Option: Option A . Squamous cell carcinoma (SCC): Squamous cell carcinoma is a type of skin cancer that arises from squamous cells, which are flat cells found in the outermost layer of the skin. SCC can occur in various areas of the body, including the skin, lips, mouth, throat, esophagus, lungs, and other internal organs. It has the potential to metastasize and spread to nearby lymph nodes and distant sites, making it more likely to spread through the lymphatic route compared to basal cell carcinoma. Option B . Merkel cell carcinoma (MCC): Merkel cell carcinoma is a rare and aggressive type of skin cancer that develops from Merkel cells, which are involved in the sensation of touch. MCC typically occurs on sun-exposed areas of the skin, such as the head, neck, and arms. It has a higher tendency to spread through the lymphatic system, involving nearby lymph nodes and potentially metastasizing to distant sites. Option D . Malignant melanoma: Malignant melanoma is a type of skin cancer that arises from melanocytes, the pigment-producing cells of the skin. It is known for its ability to metastasize and spread rapidly. Malignant melanoma has a high potential to invade lymphatic vessels and lymph nodes, leading to lymphatic metastasis. It can also spread through the bloodstream to distant organs, such as the liver, lungs, brain, and bones. Early detection and treatment are crucial for improving outcomes in cases of malignant melanoma. Reference: .",

      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: B) Retinoblastoma Explanation: The child presents with leukocoria (white pupillary reflex) and progressive clumsiness, raising suspicion for an intraocular malignancy. The absence of a red reflex suggests an opaque mass within the eye, which is highly indicative of retinoblastoma , the most common primary intraocular malignancy in children. Age of Presentation: Usually before 3 years, with non-familial cases diagnosed by 1 year. Clinical Features: Leukocoria (most common presenting sign) Strabismus (misaligned eyes) due to loss of vision Proptosis in advanced cases Orbital invasion and metastasis in late stages. Histopathology: Small round blue cells are characteristic of primitive neuroectodermal tumours. Anastomosing areas of necrosis Flexner-Wintersteiner rosettes (well-differentiated tumours) Molecular Pathogenesis: RB1 gene mutation on chromosome 13q14 , leading to loss of cell cycle control. Loss of both alleles of RB1 leads to uncontrolled retinal cell proliferation. Wilms tumour (Option A), a nephroblastoma, typically presents with an abdominal mass, hematuria, and hypertension and histologically shows a triphasic pattern with blastemal, stromal, and epithelial components.

      "explanation": "Correct Answer: A) Telomerase Explanation: Telomerase maintains telomere length , preventing chromosome degradation. Telomere shortening occurs with each cell division, contributing to cellular ageing and death . However, telomerase extends telomeres , enabling indefinite division . In cancer cells , its overexpression promotes uncontrolled proliferation and immortality . Incorrect Options: Topoisomerase (Option B) is responsible for manipulating the structure of DNA by inducing and resolving DNA strand breaks. Helicase (Option C) unwinds the DNA double helix, allowing other enzymes to access and replicate the DNA. RNA polymerase (Option D) synthesises RNA from a DNA template during transcription, essential for gene expression and protein synthesis. While its dysregulation can occur in cancer, it is not directly linked to cancer cell immortality. Reference: Robbins & Cotran Pathologic Basis of Disease, 10th Edition, Pages 303 - 305",

      "question": "The lining epithelium of the respiratory tract of a middle-aged man who is a chronic smoker shows a change from columnar to stratified squamous epithelium, as depicted in the image below. The change is called what?",
      "options": {
        "A": "Dysplasia",
        "B": "Hypertrophy",
        "C": "Atrophy",
        "D": "Metaplasia"
      },
      "correct_answer": "D",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: D) Metaplasia Explanation: Metaplasia refers to the reversible change in which one type of adult cell is replaced by another type. In this case, the columnar epithelium of the respiratory tract is replaced by stratified squamous epithelium, often as a result of chronic irritation, such as smoking. Metaplasia: Metaplasia is a reversible change in which another cell type replaces one differentiated cell type (epithelial or mesenchymal). Metaplasia is a change in the phenotype of differentiated cells, often in response to chronic irritation that makes cells better able to withstand stress; usually induced by altered differentiation pathway of tissue stem cells, may result in reduced functions or increased propensity for malignant transformation. Barrett's oesophagus is characterised by the replacement of the normal squamous epithelium of the lower oesophagus with columnar epithelium containing goblet cells & is considered an adaptive response to chronic exposure to gastric acid and bile reflux in the setting of GERD. The presence of Barrett's oesophagus increases the risk of developing oesophagal adenocarcinoma. Transformation of columnar epithelium to squamous epithelium: In the respiratory tract , in response to chronic irritation, such as smoking, the columnar epithelium undergoes metaplasia to squamous epithelium, leading to a condition known as squamous metaplasia. Conversion of glandular epithelium to squamous epithelium: This type of metaplasia can be seen in the cervix , where the normal glandular epithelium undergoes metaplasia to the squamous epithelium in response to chronic inflammation or irritation, leading to a condition known as cervical squamous metaplasia. Substitution of mesenchymal cells with epithelial cells: An example of this can be seen in osseous metaplasia , where mesenchymal cells differentiate into bone-forming osteoblasts, leading to the formation of ectopic bone within soft tissues. Incorrect Options: Dysplasia (Option A) refers to the abnormal development or growth of cells or tissues. It is characterised by disordered cell structures and is considered a precursor to cancer. Hypertrophy (Option B) is the increase in the size of cells, leading to the enlargement of an organ or tissue. It typically occurs in response to increased functional demand or external stimulation. Atrophy (Option C) is the reduction in the size or number of cells, leading to the shrinkage of an organ",

        "C": "Liquid paraffin",
        "D": "Formalin-fixed"
      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: B) Frozen section Explanation: The frozen section is done for the fixation of fats. It is a technique used to examine tissue samples quickly by freezing them and then cutting them into thin slices for immediate microscopic examination. This method is often preferred for fat tissue examination because it prevents the loss of lipid content, which can be affected by formalin fixation. Advantages: It provides rapid results & ideal for intraoperative consultations (e.g., determining malignancy during surgery). It is essential for preserving certain tissue components like fat, enzymes, and lipids that might be damaged by formalin fixation. Fixatives & uses: Technique / Tissue Fixative Electron microscopy Glutaraldehyde Bone marrow (Trephine biopsy) Zenker’s fluid GI biopsy Bouin’s fluid Brain Formalin ammonium chloride Adrenal biopsy Orth’s fluid Pap smear Ethanol IHC (Immunohistochemistry) (Option A) is used to detect specific proteins or antigens in tissue sections using targeted antibodies. Although IHC can identify markers associated with fat cells, it is not a fixation method for examining fat. Liquid paraffin (Option C) is not a fixation agent but a mounting medium applied to tissue sections on slides. It provides optical clarity and preserves the specimen but does not fix or preserve fat specifically. Formalin fixation (Option D) is a commonly used method to preserve tissue samples in histopathology. While it preserves the general structure of tissues, it is not ideal for preserving fat. Formalin can cause partial extraction of fat, leading to the loss of fat droplets and artefacts during tissue processing.

        "C": "Metaplasia",
        "D": "Hyperplasia"
      },
      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: A) Dysplasia Explanation: The findings described in the pap smear hyperchromatic nuclei, irregular nuclear borders, and low maturation index are characteristic of dysplasia , a pre-cancerous condition. Dysplasia is abnormal cell growth and differentiation, often seen in the epithelial layer , without penetration through the basement membrane . This is reversible in the early stages (may become irreversible if the entire epithelium is involved). Carcinoma (Option B) refers to invasive cancer where the abnormal cells have breached the basement membrane and spread beyond the epithelial layer. The description clearly states that the basement membrane is intact, ruling out carcinoma. Metaplasia (Option C) is the replacement of one type of cell with another, often occurring in response to tissue damage, repair, chronic irritation, or regeneration. It does not explain the nuclear changes (hyperchromasia and irregularity) seen in the pap smear. Hyperplasia (Option D) is an increase in the number of cells in a tissue, typically in response to a stimulus. It does not usually involve abnormal nuclear features like hyperchromasia and irregular borders, which are more indicative of dysplasia .

        "D": "Germ cell tumour"
      },
      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: A) Thymoma Explanation: The diagnosis of pure red cell aplasia (PRCA) in this patient, coupled with a mediastinal mass , strongly suggests a thymoma, a tumor of the thymus gland , which is located in the anterior mediastinum . It is often asymptomatic initially but can cause a range of paraneoplastic syndromes and is also associated with autoimmune diseases like myasthenia gravis. One of the paraneoplastic syndromes associated with thymoma is PRCA . In PRCA, red blood cell production in the bone marrow is selectively failed, while white blood cells and platelets are usually unaffected. This leads to severe anemia in the absence of any abnormalities in other cell lines. Thymoma Clinical features Mostly asymptomatic (small tumor), incidentally detected. It may compress the trachea (dyspnea), esophagus (dysphagia), recurrent laryngeal nerve (dysphonia or hoarseness of voice), and superior vena cava (superior vena cava syndrome). Investigations CT scan Investigation of choice It is used to determine the extent of the disease. Histology (definitive diagnosis) Noninvasive thymomas: Medullary-type epithelial cells (elongated or spindle-shaped) or a mixture of medullary- and cortical-type epithelial cells (admixture of polygonal cortical-type epithelial cells and a denser infiltrate of thymocytes). Invasive thymoma: Cytologically benign but locally invasive. The epithelial cells have abundant cytoplasm and rounded vesicular nuclei mixed with numerous thymocytes. Cytokeratin (marker to distinguish thymoma from lymphoma; thymomas are positive for cytokeratin) Non-Hodgkin lymphoma (Option B) can cause lymphadenopathy and mediastinal masses , but it is not associated with pure red cell aplasia. Bronchogenic carcinoma (Option C) may cause mediastinal masses due to lymph node involvement or direct tumour extension, but it is not commonly associated with pure red cell aplasia . Germ cell tumours (Option D) in the mediastinum can cause a mediastinal mass and are not typically linked with pure red cell aplasia .",

      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: B) E7 Explanation: The human papillomavirus (HPV) inactivates the retinoblastoma (RB) gene primarily through the action of the E7 protein. The E7 protein of high-risk HPV types, such as HPV-16 and HPV-18, promotes cell cycle progression by inactivating the retinoblastoma protein (p105Rb). E7 binds to p105Rb, disrupting its interaction with the E2F transcription factor, which releases E2F to activate genes essential for cell cycle progression and DNA replication. Consequently, the cell cycle becomes dysregulated, and uncontrolled cell proliferation can occur, a hallmark of HPV-associated cancers. High-risk HPV types (HPV 16, 18): High-grade cervical dysplasia and invasive cancer. Low-risk HPV types (HPV 6, 11): Genital warts (condyloma acuminatum and low-grade changes in cervical cells). Oncogenic Activities of E6 Protein (Option A ruled out) Oncogenic Activities of E7 Protein (Option B) Binds to and promotes degradation of p53 → Impairs cell growth and apoptosis regulation. Stimulates expression of TERT (telomerase reverse transcriptase) → Facilitates cellular immortalisation by maintaining telomere length.

      },
      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: C) SNAIL & TWIST Explanation: Epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) is induced by the transcription factors SNAIL and TWIST. It is a process where epithelial cells lose their polarity and cell-cell adhesion, gaining migratory and invasive properties to transform into mesenchymal stem cells, multipotent stromal cells. t is hypothesized that E-cadherin (transmembrane glycoproteins that mediate the homotypic adhesion of epithelial cells) expression is transiently silenced through this process. It is controlled by the transcription factors SNAIL and TWIST. There is downregulation of epithelial markers (e.g., E-cadherin) and also upregulation of mesenchymal markers (e.g., vimentin and smooth muscle actin). TF IIA & TF IIB (Option A) are essential general transcription factors that are key to the initiation of transcription by RNA polymerase II. TFIIA contributes to transcriptional regulation by modulating the initiation process and ensuring correct gene expression. TFIIB is responsible for forming the transcription initiation complex and facilitating the transition from initiation to elongation. Cathepsin & MMP 8 (Matrix Metalloproteinase-8) (Option B) are enzymes that degrade proteins in the extracellular matrix, playing key roles in tissue remodelling and inflammation. Cathepsins aid in wound healing and immune responses but can contribute to cancer metastasis and inflammation. Elevated MMP-8 is linked to diseases like periodontal disease, arthritis, and cancer, where it contributes to tissue damage and remodelling. STAT-5 & HIF-1 alpha (Option D) are transcription factors. STAT-5, activated by cytokine receptors, regulates cell survival, differentiation, and immune responses and is key in hematopoiesis and cancers like leukaemia. HIF-1 alpha responds to low oxygen levels, activating genes for angiogenesis, metabolism, and erythropoiesis, and plays a critical role in tumour growth in hypoxic environments.

It can also affect the peritoneum, pericardium and tunica vaginalis. Aetiology Asbestos: Mesothelioma is the most specific asbestos-associated cancer It is not associated with smoking Pathology Advanced pleural mesothelioma can cause extensive pleural fibrosis and thickening, making the affected side rigid and immobile. Later stages fix the mediastinum in place due to pleural thickening and fibrosis. The mediastinal shift is not a characteristic feature of mesothelioma. M/C cytogenetic abnormality in mesothelioma: Homozygous deletion of chromosome 9p , leading to loss of tumour suppressor gene - CDKN2A. Clinical features Progressive dyspnea, chest pain, weight loss, chronic cough, hemoptysis. Decreased breath sounds and dullness to percussion (due to pleural effusion or thickening). Diagnosis CT scan: Pleural thickening, effusion, or frozen hemithorax (not causing a mediastinal shift in the presence of effusion) Confirmed by biopsy: Epithelioid mesothelioma shows tubules, nests, or papillary structures with uniform round to oval nuclei and eosinophilic cytoplasm. Sarcomatoid mesothelioma consists of spindle-shaped cells resembling fibrosarcoma. Biphasic mesothelioma displays a mixture of both patterns. Specific markers for mesothelioma: Calretinin Epithelial membrane antigen Cytokeratin Mesothelin Prognosis Poor (median survival of 9-21 months). Mesothelioma- Gross Mesothelioma- H & E stain Mesothelioma- Calretinin stain Incorrect Options: Acute myeloid leukaemia (Option B) : While there are some associations between certain environmental toxins and leukaemia, asbestos is not a significant cause of AML.

Tumours use existing lymphatic vessels at their margins. Follows natural routes of lymphatic drainage. Tumour invades the serosal wall of the coelomic cavity, releasing tumour fragments into coelomic fluid, which is implanted elsewhere in the body cavity. Seen in most of the sarcomas. Seen in most carcinomas. Seen in Krukenberg tumour in the ovary due to metastasis from gastric carcinoma to the ovary. Exceptions: Synovial sarcoma Rhabdomyosarcoma *These tumours are spread by the lymphatic route. Exceptions: HCC RCC Follicular carcinoma of the thyroid Choriocarcinoma *These tumours are spread by a hematogenous route. Direct Seeding of Body Cavities or Surfaces: It occurs when malignant neoplasms spread to anatomical spaces that lack physical barriers, such as the peritoneal cavity (more commonly), but they can also affect other body cavities, such as the pleural, pericardial, subarachnoid, and joint spaces. Examples include: Pseudomyxoma peritonei is characterized by the presence of a gelatinous neoplastic mass filling the peritoneal cavity arising from the rupture of mucus-secreting appendiceal (most common cause) or ovarian carcinomas. Gastric carcinoma can spread to the distal end of the peritoneal cavity (Pouch of Douglas) and is known as the ‘Blummer shelf.’ Medulloblastoma from the cerebellum spreads to the spinal cord by ‘Drop metastasis.’ Squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) (Option A) arises from squamous cells in the outermost skin layer and can occur in the skin, lips, mouth, throat, esophagus, lungs, and other organs. It has a higher metastatic potential than basal cell carcinoma, often spreading via the lymphatic route. Merkel cell carcinoma (MCC) (Option B) is a rare, aggressive skin cancer arising from touch-sensitive Merkel cells. It typically occurs on sun-exposed areas like the head, neck, and arms and has a high tendency to spread via the lymphatic system. Malignant melanoma (Option D) is an aggressive skin cancer arising from melanocytes, with a high potential for lymphatic and hematogenous metastasis to organs like the liver, lungs, brain, and bones. Early detection and treatment are crucial for better outcomes. Reference: Robbins and Cotran Pathologic Basis of Disease, 10th Edition, Page 274-275.",

Types of Adrenocortical Neoplasms: Functional adenomas : It often causes hyperaldosteronism or Cushing syndrome, with virilizing neoplasms usually being carcinomas. Some neoplasms do not secrete hormones; their functionality is assessed via clinical evaluation and hormone testing. Nonfunctional Adenomas : Usually asymptomatic, often detected incidentally. Small, well-circumscribed lesions (up to 2.5 cm) have a normal surrounding adrenal cortex and are yellow-brown due to lipid content. Microscopically, they resemble normal adrenal cortex cells with minimal mitotic activity and a Ki-67 index < 5%. Adrenocortical Carcinomas : Rare and typically more functional than adenomas, often associated with virilism and other hyperadrenalism symptoms. These large, invasive tumours (>20 cm) can invade the adrenal vein, vena cava, and lymphatics, with frequent metastases to regional nodes and distant organs. Survival rates are low, with a median of 2 years.

They are not specific markers for lymphoid cells and are not typically used in the diagnosis of acute lymphoblastic leukemia. Incorrect Options: Option A - TdT: Tdt is an enzyme that is typically present in the early stages of lymphoid cell development. It is not found in mature lymphocytes but is expressed in lymphoblasts, which are the immature precursor cells in ALL. Tdt is commonly used as a marker to identify and confirm the presence of lymphoblasts in ALL. Tdt-positive staining indicates the presence of immature lymphoid cells, which is a characteristic feature of ALL. Option B - CD1a: CD1a is a cell surface marker that is predominantly expressed on Langerhans cells, which are specialized immune cells found in the skin and mucosal tissues. In the context of immunohistochemistry for ALL, CD1a is used to differentiate T-cell ALL (which is CD1a-positive) from B-cell ALL (which is CD1a-negative). Option C - CD3: CD3 is a complex of proteins that is present on the surface of mature T lymphocytes. In the context of immunohistochemistry for ALL, CD3 is used to detect T-cell ALL, as the malignant cells in this subtype express CD3 on their surface. CD3-positive staining helps confirm the T-cell lineage of the leukemia cells. Reference: .",

While enhancer mutations can contribute to gene dysregulation, they do not directly convert a proto-oncogene to an oncogene. Incorrect Options: Option A - Promoter insertion: Promoter insertion is a genetic alteration that can convert a proto-oncogene to an oncogene. When a promoter sequence is inserted near a proto-oncogene, it can lead to increased and unregulated expression of the gene, promoting cell growth and division. Option C - Gene amplification: Gene amplification refers to an increase in the number of copies of a specific gene. If a proto-oncogene undergoes amplification, it results in an increased dosage of the gene product, leading to abnormal cell proliferation and potentially converting it to an oncogene. Option D - Point mutation: Point mutations, which are single nucleotide changes in the DNA sequence, can convert a proto-oncogene to an oncogene. Point mutations can result in altered protein function, increased protein stability, or constitutive activation of signalling pathways, promoting uncontrolled cell growth and division. Reference: .",
