      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "benign tumor that most commonly occurs in the parotid gland, which is a salivary gland located in the cheek. It's characterized by its unique histological appearance, with cystic spaces and papillary projections lined by double-layered oncocytic epithelial cells and lymphoid stroma. Incorrect Options: Option B - Pleomorphic Adenoma: Pleomorphic adenoma is another type of salivary gland tumor. It is the most common type of salivary gland tumor, but it is distinct from Warthin's tumor. Pleomorphic adenoma is characterized by a mixture of epithelial and myoepithelial cells in a chondromyxoid stroma. Option C - Mucoepidermoid Carcinoma: Mucoepidermoid carcinoma is a malignant salivary gland tumor. It is not synonymous with Warthin's tumor. Mucoepidermoid carcinoma is characterized by a combination of mucous-secreting, epidermoid (squamous), and intermediate cells. It is one of the most common malignant salivary gland tumors. Option D - Acinic Cell Carcinoma: Acinic cell carcinoma is another type of malignant salivary gland tumor. It is characterized by the presence of acinar cells, which produce serous (watery) secretions. It is not the same as Warthin's tumor. Reference: .",

      "question": "Which of the following features is not observed in pleomorphic adenoma?",
      "options": {
        "A": "Myoepithelial cells",
        "B": "Keratin pearls",
        "C": "Chondroid differentiation",
        "D": "Perineural invasion"
      },
      "correct_answer": "D",
      "explanation": "invasion occurs in carcinoma ex pleomorphic adenoma , a malignant transformation of pleomorphic adenoma. Pleomorphic Adenoma: Most common salivary gland neoplasm : Represents ~60% of parotid tumours, less common in submandibular and minor salivary glands. Benign tumour : Composed of ductal (epithelial) , myoepithelial , and mesenchymal cells (also called mixed tumour). Risk factors : Radiation exposure increases risk. Chromosomal rearrangements, including overexpression of PLAG1 and mutations in HMGA2 , are commonly associated. Clinical presentation : Painless, slow-growing, mobile, discrete masses, usually in the parotid, submandibular, or buccal cavity. Recurrence : 4% recurrence rate after parotidectomy; 25% after simple enucleation due to tumour extension beyond the capsule. Malignant transformation : Occurs more often with the age of the lesion. 2% of tumours present <5 years develop malignancy; 10% present >15 years develop malignancy, usually adenocarcinomas or undifferentiated carcinomas. Aggressive cancers : If malignant transformation occurs, cancers are highly infiltrative, with a 30-50% mortality rate at 5 years. Morphology: Size : Typically rounded, well-demarcated masses <6 cm. Histological features : Heterogeneous morphology with ductal, acinar, tubule-like structures, and myoepithelial cells (Option A) . Background of myxoid, hyaline, and chondroid stroma (Option C) (cartilage-like areas). Rare bone foci. No significant epithelial dysplasia or mitotic activity. Tumour behaviour : Similar clinical course regardless of whether epithelial or mesenchymal elements dominate. Keratin pearls (Option B) : While rare, keratin pearls can occasionally be observed in pleomorphic adenoma, especially when there is squamous metaplasia within the tumour.
