      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: B) Platelets Explanation: Among the given options, platelets are the least radiosensitive cells. Radiosensitivity refers to the susceptibility of cells or tissues to the effects of radiation. Cells with higher rates of proliferation and less differentiation tend to be more radiosensitive because they are actively dividing and thus more vulnerable to the damaging effects of radiation. Platelets are the least radiosensitive as they do not divide actively. Order of Radiosensitivity: Lymphocytes > neutrophils ~ monocytes > platelets Reference: Radiation sensitivity of human and murine peripheral blood lymphocytes, stem and progenitor cells - ScienceDirect .",

      "question": "Which amino acid is necessary for the production of nitric oxide in the blood vessels?",
      "options": {
        "A": "Citrulline",
        "B": "Arginine",
        "C": "Histidine",
        "D": "Tryptophan"
      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: B) Arginine Explanation: Nitric oxide (NO) is a vital signalling molecule involved in vasodilation and various other physiological processes. Nitric oxide synthesis in blood vessels requires the amino acid arginine , which serves as its precursor. Steps in Nitric Oxide Synthesis: Enzyme Involved : Nitric oxide synthase (NOS) converts L-arginine to nitric oxide (NO) and L-citrulline in the presence of oxygen and cofactors like NADPH and tetrahydrobiopterin (BH4). Physiological Role of NO : NO is a potent vasodilator that relaxes vascular smooth muscle cells, thus regulating blood pressure and improving blood flow. It also has roles in neurotransmission and immune response. Citrulline (Option A) is a byproduct of nitric oxide synthesis and can be recycled back into arginine via the urea cycle , but it is not directly used in NO production. Histidine (Option C) is a precursor for histamine and is involved in immune responses, but it does not play a role in NO synthesis. Tryptophan (Option D) is a precursor for serotonin and melatonin but is not involved in nitric oxide production. Reference: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34251644/",
