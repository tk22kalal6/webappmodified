Thus, peripheral smear shows reticulocytosis.

MCV is a laboratory value that measures the average size and volume of red blood cells expressed as femtoliters (fL). It provides essential information in the diagnostic process for anaemia. To calculate the MCV value, the per cent hematocrit is divided by the erythrocyte count and multiplied by 10. MCV (fL) = PCV x 10/ RBC count Given: RBC count: 4.5 million cells/ µ L; Hematocrit/ PCV: 40% Using the formula for MCV: MCV (in fL) = (Hematocrit %)×10/(RBC×10 12 /L) MCV (fL) = Hematocrit(%)×10/RBC count(millions/ µ L) MCV = 30×10/4.5 MCV = 300/4.5 I MCV = 66.7 fL From the calculated MCV, the patient is likely to have Microcytic anaemia.

Corrected reticulocyte count (CRC) is the correction for the degree of anaemia, and it's calculated using the following formula. CRC= Observed reticulocyte count x Patient’s haemoglobin / Standard haemoglobin Standard hemoglobin for men= 15g/dl; for women=13g/dl For the the above patient: CRC = 5 x 9 / 15 = 3.0 Significance of Corrected Reticulocyte Count The corrected reticulocyte count is essential in evaluating anaemia to avoid misleadingly high percentages. Anaemia decreases RBCs, potentially inflating the reticulocyte percentage without increased erythropoiesis. The correction adjusts the reticulocyte percentage relative to the reduced RBC count, providing a more accurate assessment of bone marrow response. An increased corrected reticulocyte count indicates effective erythropoiesis. Low reticulocyte production may suggest bone marrow issues, iron, vitamin B12, or folate deficiencies.

      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: B) New Methylene blue Explanation: The presence of anaemia typically triggers the body's response by increasing erythropoiesis, releasing reticulocytes into circulation early as part of the compensatory mechanism to replenish red blood cells and enhance tissue oxygenation. New Methylene blue is used to visualise reticulocytes in peripheral blood smears. It is a supravital stain that stains living states like the RNA in reticulocytes. It picks up RNA as a bluish reticulated network within erythrocytes. This stain is useful in assessing bone marrow function and erythropoietic activity. Prussian blue (Option A): Prussian blue stain detects iron in hemosiderin-containing cells. Iron is chemically reactive and turns blue-black when exposed to potassium ferrocyanide, which is present in Prussian blue. PAS Stain (Option C): A periodic acid-Schiff (PAS) stain detects polysaccharides, such as glycogen, glycoproteins, glycolipids, and mucin in tissues. Wright's stain (Option D): Wright’s stain is a mixture of eosin (red) and methylene blue dyes. It is used in blood smears and bone marrow aspirates to detect RBCs, WBCs, and Platelets abnormalities.",

      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: A) Reticulocytes Explanation: Reticulocytes are smaller pyknotic cells with increased haemoglobin content and have no nucleus. Increased RBC production occurs as a compensatory mechanism in anaemia, initiating erythropoiesis, which is stimulated by the release of erythropoietin from the kidneys. Erythropoietin prompts bone marrow to increase red blood cell production by promoting the proliferation and differentiation of hematopoietic stem cells into erythroid progenitor cells, ultimately leading to the maturation of red blood cells. Stages of Erythropoiesis It starts with Hematopoietic stem cells(HSC) → Common Myeloid Progenitor cells(CMP) → Proerythroblasts. Once the proerythroblast has been formed, it divides multiple times, eventually forming many mature RBCs. Proerythroblast- first cell in which Hb is visualised on Electron microscopy. Intermediate normoblast- first cell in which Hb is visualised on Light microscopy. The first-generation cells are called basophil erythroblasts because they stain with basic dyes. Haemoglobin first appears in polychromatophilic erythroblasts and progressively increases. As erythropoiesis progresses, the cell and nucleus size progressively decreases. The reticulocyte is the first cell without a nucleus. During the reticulocyte stage, the cells pass from the bone marrow into the blood capillaries by diapedesis (squeezing through the pores of the capillary membrane). factors affecting erythropoiesis increasing- EPO, Growth hormone, T3, Cortisol, Testosterone decreasing- estrogen",

The marrow in CML is hypercellular due to increased numbers of maturing granulocytic precursors (promyelocytes, myelocytes, eosinophils and basophils). A characteristic finding is the presence of scattered macrophages with abundant wrinkled, green-blue cytoplasm (sea-blue histiocytes). CML can lead to increased cellularity in the bone marrow, it typically does not cause significant fibrosis or hypocellularity, the primary factor contributing to dry taps.

        "A": "Anterior Superior Iliac spine",
        "B": "Posterior Superior Iliac spine",
        "C": "Proximal femur",
        "D": "Proximal tibia"
      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: B) Posterior Superior Iliac spine Explanation: The posterior superior iliac spine is the preferred site for obtaining bone marrow in adults because it contains the most cellular marrow, there are no vital organs in close proximity, and it is a non-weight-bearing structure.

        "D": "Quincke needle"
      },
      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: C) Jamshidi needle Explanation: The Jamshidi Needle (T-shaped needle) is the most commonly used needle for bone marrow aspiration and biopsy due to its design, which allows for minimal trauma and obtaining an intact core biopsy. Salah needle (Option A) : This needle is used for only bone marrow aspiration and not for biopsy. Klima needle (Option B): The Klima needle is also used for bone marrow aspiration. It functions similarly to the Salah needle in aspirating bone marrow cells but is not the primary tool for obtaining a core biopsy Quincke needle (Option D): The Quincke needle is used primarily for lumbar puncture procedures (spinal taps) to collect cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). It is not used for bone marrow biopsies.",
