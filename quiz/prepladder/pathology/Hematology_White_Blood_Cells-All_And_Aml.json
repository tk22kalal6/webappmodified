      "explanation": "Correct answer: D) 30% Explanation: According to the FAB classification , 30% of blast cells must be present in the bone marrow and peripheral smear to diagnose acute leukaemia. Classification for diagnosis of acute lymphoblastic leukaemia: WHO classification FAB (French-American-British) classification Basis of classification It incorporates genetics, immunophenotypic, and morphological features. It is primarily based on morphology and cytochemistry Subtypes B-cell ALL, NOS (not otherwise specified). B-cell ALL with recurrent genetic abnormalities. T-cell ALL. ALL-L1- small uniform cells ALL-L2- large cells with irregular nuclei ALL-L3- large cells with regular nuclei Prognostic information It provides prognostic information based on genetic abnormalities. Limited prognostic information and focused on morphology. Clinical utility Used for diagnosis, treatment, and prognostication. Less commonly used in clinical practice and more historical. Diagnosis threshold >20% blasts in the bone marrow. >30% blasts in the bone marrow. Reference: WHO Classification of Tumors of Haematopoietic and Lymphoid Tissues 2017, Page 77",

        "B": "Expression of surface immunoglobulins",

        "D": "t(9;22) Philadelphia chromosome"
      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: B) Expression of surface immunoglobulins Explanation: Unlike Burkitt lymphoma cells, which typically express surface immunoglobulins, the lymphoblasts in ALL L3 subtype do not express surface immunoglobulins. Instead, they express other markers, such as CD10 and CD19. FAB classification of ALL: L1 L2 L3 Occurrence More common - Less common Morphology Small homogenous blasts Large heterogenous blasts Large homogenous blasts Cytoplasm Scant blue Moderately weak basophilic Abundant basophilic with prominent vacuoles Nucleus Regular Irregular nuclear outlines - Nucleoli Small & indistinct Prominent - Chromatin Coarse & dark purple Pink - Prognosis Best - Poor ALL-L3 is similar to Burkitt’s lymphoma. The image below shows the FAB types of ALL. Presence of lymphoblasts with vacuoles and cytoplasmic blebs ( Option A): The presence of lymphoblasts with vacuoles and cytoplasmic blebs is a characteristic feature of L3 subtype ALL. Association with Epstein-Barr virus ( Option C): Burkitt lymphoma is strongly associated with Epstein-Barr Virus (EBV) infection. However, while EBV infection may be present in some ALL cases, it is not a defining characteristic of the ALL L3 subtype. t(9;22) Philadelphia chromosome ( Option D): The Philadelphia chromosome, resulting from the translocation t(9;22), is associated with a different subtype of ALL (Philadelphia chromosome-positive ALL, or Ph+ ALL) rather than the L3 subtype. Ph+ ALL is characterised by the BCR-ABL1 fusion gene (190 kDa fusion protein).",

      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "Correct answer: A) CD13+, CD33+, CD34+, HLA-DR+ Explanation: The peripheral smear shows myeloblasts (large, irregularly shaped cells with prominent nuclei and moderately granular cytoplasm), and needle-like inclusions in the cytoplasm of blasts (Auer rods) , suggesting acute myeloid leukaemia (AML). The immunophenotype associated with AML is CD13+, CD33+, CD34+, and HLA-DR+. AML is characterised by the presence of myeloid lineage markers. CD13, CD33, and CD34 are commonly expressed on AML blasts. Additionally, the presence of HLA-DR is typical in AML immunophenotyping. CD19+, CD20-, CD22+, CD79a- (Option B): This immunophenotyping pattern is characteristic of B-cell ALL. In B-ALL, blasts typically express B-cell markers such as CD19 , CD22 , and CD79a . CD20 expression is variable but often negative in B-ALL. CD3+, CD4+, CD8+, CD5- (Option C): This immunophenotyping pattern is indicative of T-cell ALL. In T-ALL, blasts express T-cell markers such as CD3 , CD4 , CD8 , and CD5 , reflecting their origin from T-cell precursors. CD10+, CD19+, CD20+, CD22- (Option D): This immunophenotyping pattern is suggestive of B-cell Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia (B-CLL).

        "D": "Myeloproliferative disorder"
      },
      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Correct answer: C) Aleukemic leukaemia Explanation: In this scenario, the patient presents with pancytopenia, fatigue, easy bruising, and recurrent infections. The absence of blast cells in the peripheral smear despite the presence of cytopenias suggests aleukemic leukaemia. Aleukemic leukaemia or aleukemic leukaemia cutis is leukaemia without circulating blast cells in the peripheral blood. While blast cells may be absent in the peripheral smear, they can still be present in the bone marrow. The malignant white cells invade the skin before they appear in the peripheral blood or bone marrow. Patients may present with symptoms similar to other types of leukaemia, including fatigue, weakness, fever, weight loss, and easy bruising or bleeding. Diagnosis requires a high index of suspicion, as the absence of blast cells in the peripheral blood smear can make it challenging to identify. A bone marrow biopsy may reveal the presence of leukaemia cells, aiding in diagnosis. Aplastic anemia (Option A): Aplastic anaemia is characterised by pancytopenia (low red blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets) due to bone marrow failure. Unlike leukaemia, it does not involve the overproduction of immature cells (blast cells) and does not typically present with blasts on peripheral smears. Myelodysplasia (Option B): Myelodysplasia, or myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS), is a group of blood disorders characterised by abnormal development and function of blood-forming cells in the bone marrow. In MDS, the bone marrow produces immature or defective blood cells that may not function properly. Myeloproliferative disorder (Option D): Myeloproliferative disorders (MPDs) are a group of conditions characterised by excessive production of mature blood cells. Unlike leukaemia, MPDs do not typically present with pancytopenia (reduced levels of all blood cell types) and do not involve the overproduction of blast cells seen in leukaemia.
