      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: C) Palmar erythema Explanation: Increased estrogen levels in chronic liver failure lead to vascular changes, resulting in palmar erythema and spider angiomas. This condition can also cause hypogonadism and gynecomastia in males. Increased PT and aPTT (Option A) are primarily due to impaired synthesis of clotting factors by the damaged liver rather than the effects of hyperestrogenemia. Flapping tremors (aka asterixis) (Option B) are commonly associated with hepatic encephalopathy in cirrhosis, primarily due to elevated ammonia levels rather than estrogen. Jaundice (Option D) seen in cirrhosis is a result of impaired bilirubin metabolism due to liver dysfunction rather than being directly influenced by estrogen levels.

      "explanation": "Correct Answer: A) Hepatitis B Explanation: Hepatitis B primarily affects the liver by causing inflammation and can lead to chronic liver disease, cirrhosis, and liver cancer, but it does not directly cause fatty liver disease. Fatty liver disease is often associated with several factors, such as alcoholism (Option D) , obesity, insulin resistance, metabolic syndrome, and type 2 diabetes (Option C). Chronic Hepatitis C (Option B) can cause liver inflammation and damage, potentially resulting in fat accumulation in the liver cells and leading to fatty liver disease.

These are characteristic findings of acute viral hepatitis. Biopsy findings of acute viral hepatitis Ballooning degeneration of hepatocytes Councilman bodies Spotty necrosis Dropout necrosis and Kupffer cell hyperplasia (Empty space lined by Kupffer cells) Absent or mild portal inflammation Interface hepatitis (Option A) is characterised by inflammatory cell infiltrates at the interface between the portal tracts and hepatic lobules and is prominent in Chronic viral hepatitis rather than acute. Ground glass hepatocytes (Option C) (aka Shikata cells) are densely eosinophilic cells with glassy cytoplasm due to HBsAg. They are seen in chronic Hepatitis B infection but not acute hepatitis. Bridging fibrosis (Option D) refers to fibrous septa or thick collagenous bands connecting adjacent portal tracts and central veins. It is typically observed in Chronic hepatitis and is indicative of advanced liver fibrosis. Reference: Robbins and Cotran, Pathological Basis of Disease, 10th Edition, Page831",

With cessation of alcohol intake and appropriate treatment, this perivenular or pericellular fibrosis can regress, leading to improvement in liver function and histology.

      "explanation": "Correct Answer: C) Stellate cells Explanation: Hepatic stellate cells (or Ito cells) are pericytes located in the space of Disse, between hepatocytes and sinusoidal endothelial cells in the liver. In the healthy liver, these cells store vitamin A in lipid droplets and regulate sinusoidal blood flow. Upon liver injury, they activate and transform into myofibroblast-like cells, release TGF β , and lead to fibrosis by producing excessive extracellular matrix, such as collagen. Kupffer cells (Option A) are macrophages found in sinusoids of the liver, involved in phagocytosis. Pit cells (Option B) are liver-associated lymphocytes, primarily NK (Natural Killer) cells. They contribute to liver immune surveillance but are not directly implicated in liver fibrosis. Hepatocytes (Option D) are vital liver cells.
