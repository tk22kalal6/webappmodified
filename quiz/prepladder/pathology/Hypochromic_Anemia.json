      "question": "A 60-year-old female presents with chronic fatigue, shortness of breath, tingling and numbness in her hands and feet, bloating, and epigastric pain after meals. She has a history of occasional heartburn and nausea. On examination, she is pale, has a smooth, enlarged tongue with the following findings on the hand. Lab investigations show haemoglobin to be 9.6 g% and MCV 112. What is the most likely diagnosis?",

        "A": "Iron deficiency anaemia",

      },
      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: C) Pernicious anaemia Explanation: Pernicious anaemia is the likely diagnosis due to macrocytic anaemia (high MCV), chronic fatigue, neurological symptoms (tingling and numbness), and gastrointestinal issues (bloating and epigastric pain). The physical signs of pallor and a smooth, enlarged tongue, along with the image of knuckle hyperpigmentation further indicate vitamin B12 deficiency, characteristic of pernicious anaemia. Pernicious Anemia: Pernicious anaemia is a specific form of megaloblastic anaemia caused by autoimmune gastritis that impairs the production of the intrinsic factor required for vitamin B12 uptake from the gut. Three types of antibodies: Type 1: Inhibit B12 binding to intrinsic factor . Type 2: Inhibit B12-IF binding to iliac cubilin receptors. Type 3: Target parietal cells. Clinical features : Fatigue and pallor. Hyperpigmentation : Mainly on knuckles and interphalangeal areas. Atrophic glossitis (beefy red smooth tongue). Atrophic gastritis (due to antibodies against parietal cells). Increased gastric adenocarcinoma risk. Neurological manifestations: Subacute combined degeneration of the spinal tract. Both sensory and motor loss (combined degeneration) Headache, fatigue , impaired balance , paresthesia, muscle weakness and neuropathy . Blood smear: Iron deficiency anaemia typically presents with microcytic anaemia (Option A) . Folate deficiency can present with macrocytic anaemia but is less likely to cause neurological symptoms and knuckle hyperpigmentation (Option B) .",

      "question": "A patient presents with tiredness and myalgia for the past 3 months. She has hypertension, psoriasis and hyperuricemia, for which she is on multiple medications.

      },
      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: C) Methotrexate Explanation: The peripheral blood smear shows enlarged oval-shaped red blood cells (macro-ovalocytes) with hyperchromia and hypersegmented neutrophils. This suggests megaloblastic anaemia , which in this scenario would be due to folate deficiency caused by methotrexate. Common causes of folate deficiency are given below : Decreased intake Inadequate diet. Alcoholism. Infancy. Impaired absorption Malabsorption states. Intrinsic intestinal disease. Anticonvulsants, oral contraceptives. Increased loss Haemodialysis. Increased requirement Pregnancy. Infancy. Disseminated cancer. Markedly increased hematopoiesis.

        "A": "Reduced plasma homocysteine levels",

        "C": "Raised urinary methylmalonic acid levels",
        "D": "Anaemia doesn’t improve after folate administration"
      },
      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: C) Raised urinary methylmalonic acid levels Explanation: Plasma and urinary methylmalonic acid levels will be elevated in case of vitamin B12 deficiency but not with folate deficiency. This is because the enzyme methylmalonyl coenzyme A mutase's isomerisation of methylmalonyl coenzyme A to succinyl coenzyme A requires adenosylcobalamin (a form of vitamin B12) as a cofactor. A deficiency of vitamin B12 thus leads to increased plasma and urine levels of methylmalonic acid. Vitamin B12 is key in converting homocysteine to methionine; hence, its deficiency will lead to elevated homocysteine levels (Option A) rather than reduction. Neurological symptoms will remain the same, if not worsen, after folate administration in case of Vitamin B12 deficient megaloblastic anaemia (Option B) . Improvement in symptoms and reduction in megaloblastic count occur after folate administration, even if the anaemia is due to Vitamin B12 deficiency (Option D) .

      "question": "Which of the following is true when increased urinary formiminoglutamic acid is detected in a patient to whom histidine is given?",

        "A": "Presence of antibodies against intrinsic factor",
        "B": "Deficiency of folic acid is present",
        "C": "Neurological symptoms are common",
        "D": "Presence of worm infestation"
      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: B) Deficiency of folic acid is present Explanation: Elevated urinary levels of formiminoglutamic acid (FIGlu) in a patient to whom histidine is given suggests the presence of folic acid deficiency . This is called the FIGlu test. Folic acid is normally required in its tetrahydrofolate form to regulate DNA synthesis and the production of methionine, glutamate, etc. Formiminoglutamic acid derived from histidine will be converted to glutamate in the presence of folic acid. If there is a folic acid deficiency, this conversion will not occur, leading to elevated urinary formiminoglutamic acid. Presence of antibodies against intrinsic factor (Option A): Antibodies to intrinsic factor will be seen in pernicious anaemia in which there will be vitamin B12 deficiency. Neurological symptoms are common (Option C): Neurological symptoms will be seen in Vitamin B12 deficiency , not folate deficiency. Reference: The role of the FIGLU test in identifying folate deficiency, as folic acid plays a very significant role in purine synthesis, and folate deficiency leads to defective DNA signalling, leading to megaloblastosis",

      "question": "A patient presents with inflammation of the mouth and tongue. He is a non-vegetarian. As part of the evaluation, a Schilling test was done and found unremarkable. Which of the following investigations could lead to the aetiology behind this presentation?",
      "options": {
        "A": "Serum folate levels",
        "B": "Peripheral blood smear",
        "C": "Anti-IF antibody levels",
        "D": "Serum Vitamin B12 levels"
      },
      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: A) Serum folate levels Explanation: It is a scenario of possible megaloblastic anaemia due to folate deficiency. Hence, serum/red cell folate can lead to the aetiology behind this presentation. Schilling test is done by orally administering the patient with radioactive vitamin B12 and checking its presence in the urine. If present, as with this case, it is understood that there is no problem with the absorption. In addition to an unremarkable Schilling test, the fact that vitamin B12 deficiency is uncommon among non-vegetarians suggests a diagnosis of folate-deficient megaloblastic anaemia. Stage of test 24-hour urinary excretion of radiolabelled B12 Inference Stage 1: Oral radiolabelled B12 + IM dose of unlabelled B12 (to saturate liver stores) >10% (Normal) Malnutrition <10% Stage 2 of the test is done Stage 2: Oral radiolabelled B12 + Intrinsic factor >10% Pernicious anaemia <10% Stage 3 of the test is done Stage 3: Oral radiolabelled B12 + Antibiotics (5-day course) >10% Small intestinal bacterial overgrowth <10% Stage 4 of the test is done Stage 4: Oral radiolabelled B12 + Recombinant pancreatic enzymes >10% Pancreatic insufficiency (Cystic fibrosis, chronic pancreatitis) <10% Consider other ileal diseases Peripheral blood smear (Option B) may exhibit megalocytes with hyper-segmented neutrophils suggestive of megaloblastic anaemia, but the aetiology cannot be identified based on this. Anti-IF (intrinsic factor) antibodies (Option C) are found in patients with pernicious anaemia, and since the Schilling test is unremarkable, it can be ruled out.
