      "question": "A 45-year-old female presents with a palpable lump in her left breast which is freely mobile and painless. A biopsy of the lump was performed, and a histopathological examination was done. Which feature from the biopsy report is most likely to differentiate between benign and malignant breast lesions?",
      "options": {
        "A": "Presence of well-defined glandular structures",
        "B": "Evidence of invasion into surrounding tissues",
        "C": "Low mitotic rate",
        "D": "Presence of fibrous stroma"
      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: B) Evidence of invasion into surrounding tissues Explanation: Infiltration of cancer cells into adjacent structures is a key characteristic of malignancy. The presence of invasion indicates aggressive tumour behaviour and increases the risk of metastasis to lymph nodes and distant organs. Feature Benign Lesions Malignant Lesions Growth Localised Invasive (Option B) Microscopic Appearance Resemble normal tissue and maintain differentiated features. (Option A) Cellular atypia , mitotic figures, loss of tissue organisation. Macroscopic Appearance Well-defined borders Irregular borders, necrosis, hemorrhage. Histological Features Cells are typically uniform in size and shape, with minimal nuclear atypia and low mitotic rate. (Option C) Cells may display pleomorphism, increased nuclear-to-cytoplasmic ratio, high mitotic rate, and evidence of invasion or metastasis. Presence of fibrous stroma (Option D): fibroadenoma of the breast (a benign lesion) is a fibroepithelial tumor with a prominent fibrous stroma, a hallmark feature that helps distinguish them histologically.

      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: A) Pleomorphic adenoma Explanation: Pleomorphic adenoma is the most common benign tumour of the salivary glands, often found in the parotid gland. Pleomorphic adenoma, also known as a mixed tumour, typically contains epithelial components (such as glandular cells) and mesenchymal components (such as myxoid stroma, islands of cartilage, or bone). Mucoepidermoid carcinoma (Option B): It arises from the epithelial epithelial lining of the ducts and acini within the salivary glands, characterised by a mixture of mucin-producing, squamous, and intermediate cells. Acinic cell carcinoma (Option C): Acinic cell carcinoma is primarily an epithelial tumour arising from the acinar cells of the salivary glands. Warthin tumor/ Papillary cystadenoma lymphomatosum (Option D): It arises from the epithelial cells lining the ducts of the salivary glands, particularly the parotid gland and is characterised by cystic spaces lined with oncocytic epithelial cells and surrounded by lymphoid stroma.

      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: A) Teratoma Explanation: Teratomas originate from totipotent germ cells (capability to differentiate into any cell type) present in the ovaries, testes, or abnormal midline embryonic rests. Microscopic examination of the tumour confirms the diagnosis by identifying tissues derived from all three germ layers: Ectodermal tissue (epithelium and neural tissue), Mesodermal tissue (muscle, fat, bone, cartilage), and Endodermal tissue (thyroid tissue, gastrointestinal epithelium) Serous cystadenoma (Option B): Lined by a single layer of cuboidal or columnar epithelium, often with cilia, resembling fallopian tube epithelium. Mucinous cystadenoma (Option C): Lined by tall, mucin-secreting columnar epithelium without cilia, resembling intestinal or endocervical epithelium. Granulosa cell tumor (Option D): Shows Call-Exner bodies (small, eosinophilic, rosette-like structures) and coffee bean-shaped nuclei, characteristic of granulosa cells.",

      "question": "A 55-year-old man presents with chronic heartburn and difficulty swallowing. Upon examination, the physician suspects gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) and orders an upper GI endoscopic biopsy, which reveals the presence of columnar epithelium in the lower oesophagus, replacing the normal squamous epithelium. Which of the following terms describes the observed cellular change?",
      "options": {
        "A": "Metaplasia",
        "B": "Dysplasia",
        "C": "Anaplasia",
        "D": "Desmoplasia"
      },
      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: A) Metaplasia Explanation: In this scenario, the replacement of squamous epithelium with columnar epithelium in the lower oesophagus is consistent with metaplasia, likely due to chronic gastroesophageal reflux (AKA Barrett’s esophagus). Metaplasia is defined as the replacement of one type of cell with another, often occurring in response to tissue damage, repair, chronic irritation, or regeneration. This adaptive change aims to suit the altered local environment better. Examples: Barrett Esophagus Respiratory Epithelium (Smokers' Lung) Cervical Metaplasia Gastric Mucosa in Chronic Gastritis Bladder Metaplasia (Squamous Metaplasia) Feature Metaplasia Dysplasia (Option B) Anaplasia (Option C) Definition Replacement of one cell type by another that adapts to new stress. Disordered, precancerous epithelial cell growth. Loss of differentiation, where cells become more primitive and undifferentiated. Cause Due to exposure to irritants (e.g., gastric acid, tobacco smoke). Not considered an adaptive response; may be due to persistent metaplasia or pathologic hyperplasia. Often associated with malignant tumors or cancer. Progression May progress to dysplasia and then malignant transformation (e.g., Barrett esophagus to esophageal adenocarcinoma). May progress to carcinoma in situ and eventually to invasive carcinoma. Directly related to malignancy; anaplasia is a hallmark of cancer cells. Tissue Type Affected Can occur in both epithelial and connective tissue (e.g., myositis ossificans). Primarily affects epithelial tissue. Occurs in malignant tumors, both epithelial and mesenchymal. Reversibility Reversible with removal of the inciting cause. Mild and moderate dysplasias may regress if the cause is alleviated. Severe dysplasia often becomes irreversible. Irreversible; reflects a malignant state. Cellular Features Cells adapt by replacing one cell type with another (e.g., ciliated columnar epithelium replaced by stratified squamous epithelium). Loss of uniformity in cell size and shape (pleomorphism), loss of tissue orientation, nuclear changes (e.g., increased nuclear:cytoplasmic ratio, clumped chromatin). Complete loss of differentiation; cells are often pleomorphic, with abnormal nuclei, and lack specialized functions. Barret Esophagus: Desmoplasia (Option D): Desmoplasia denotes the excessive stimulation of collagenous stroma by the tumour's parenchymal cells. This process results in the proliferation of dense fibrous tissue, contributing to the tumour's firm or hard consistency.",

      },
      "correct_answer": "D",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: D) Intact basement membrane Explanation: An intact basement membrane is not characteristic of anaplasia. Anaplastic cells, which exhibit aggressive behaviour and loss of differentiation, often invade surrounding tissues, leading to disruption of the basement membrane. Anaplasia is characterised by several morphological changes indicative of aggressive behaviour in cancer cells: Pleomorphism: Variability in cell size and shape. (Option A) Atypical, bizarre mitotic figures: Abnormal forms of cell division indicative of rapid proliferation. Abnormal nuclear morphology: Nuclei are disproportionately large, irregularly shaped, and have coarsely clumped chromatin. Increased nuclear-to-cytoplasmic ratio: Often approaching or exceeding 1:1 instead of the normal range of 1:4 to 1:6. (Option C) Loss of polarity: Disorganized growth pattern and loss of normal cell orientation. (Option B ) Anaplasia is the hallmark of malignancy.

        "D": "Unencapsulated"
      },
      "correct_answer": "D",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: D) Unencapsulated Explanation: A hemangioma is a benign vascular tumour caused by an abnormal overgrowth of blood vessels that is distinguished from other benign tumours by: Lack of well-defined capsule. Tendency to permeate the site of origin making it difficult for surgical excision. Rapid growth rate (Option A): The rapid growth rate is a feature of malignant tumors, not benign tumors which grow slowly and localized to the site of origin. Presence of extracellular matrix (ECM) deposited by stromal cells (Option B): Benign tumours usually has a capsule, which consists of an extracellular matrix (ECM) deposited by stromal cells such as fibroblasts. Since hemangioma is unencapsulated, it is not associated with the deposition of extracellular matrix by stromal cells. Easily resected by excision (Option C): Encapsulation makes benign tumours easily resectable but since hemangiomas are unencapsulated ,they permeate site of origin making it difficult to resect.

      "explanation": "Correct Answer: C) Hepatocellular carcinoma Explanation: Hepatocellular carcinoma typically exhibits metastasis by hematogenous spread rather than direct seeding of body cavities. Direct Seeding of Body Cavities or Surfaces: It occurs when malignant neoplasms spread to anatomical spaces that lack physical barriers, such as the peritoneal cavity (more commonly), but they can also affect other body cavities, such as the pleural, pericardial, subarachnoid, and joint spaces. Examples include: Pseudomyxoma peritonei (Option A) is characterized by the presence of a gelatinous neoplastic mass filling the peritoneal cavity arising from the rupture of mucus-secreting appendiceal (most common cause) or ovarian carcinomas. Gastric carcinoma (Option B) can spread to the distal end of the peritoneal cavity (Pouch of Douglas) and is known as the ‘Blummer shelf.’ Medulloblastoma (Option D) from the cerebellum spreads to the spinal cord by ‘Drop metastasis.’ Reference: Robbins and Cotrans Pathologic basis of disease, 10th edition, Pages 273, 274",

      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: B) Also helpful in identifying metastasis in Melanoma. Explanation: The Sentinel lymph node, the first lymph node to receive metastatic cells from a primary tumour, not a secondary tumour (Option A). The sentinel lymph node is identified and removed using specialized techniques during surgery, such as lymphatic mapping and sentinel lymph node biopsy. Sentinel lymph node biopsy is commonly performed in various cancers, including breast cancer and melanoma, to determine the extent of disease spread. This procedure aids in the staging of the carcinoma for planning treatment. The presence of cancer cells in a lymph node indicates a more advanced stage of cancer and is generally associated with a poorer prognosis (Option D). ‘Skip metastasis’ is a pattern of cancer spread where tumour cells bypass the sentinel lymph node and directly metastasize to more distant lymph nodes or other organs (Option C).
