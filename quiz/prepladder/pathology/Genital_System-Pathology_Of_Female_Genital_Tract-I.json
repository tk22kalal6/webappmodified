      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: C) Columnar cells . Explanation: Layers of vaginal epithelium: Cells Functions Superficial layer It forms the outermost protective barrier, eventually shed from the surface. Intermediate layer Provide structural support to the epithelium and contribute to the thickness and resilience of the vaginal tissue. Parabasal layer Serve as transitional cells between the basal and intermediate layers, reflecting ongoing epithelial turnover and differentiation. Basal layer Mitotically active and serves as the regenerative source for the epithelium. Reference: Robbins and Cotran, Pathologic Basis of Disease, 10th Edition, Page 991.

      "options": {
        "A": "HPV 6 & 11",
        "B": "HPV 16 & 18",

        "D": "HPV 11 & 18"
      },
      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: A) HPV 6 and 11. Explanation: Histopathology image suggests Condylomata acuminata, which are benign genital warts caused by low-risk HPV 6 and 11, a double-stranded DNA virus that infects differentiated squamous epithelial cells. It is sexually transmitted and is characterized by multiple, raised, fleshy skin-coloured growths and involves vulvar, vagina, perineal, and perianal regions. Condyloma acuminata are cauliflower-like, dry, and bulky, typically found in the squamous mucosa of the anal canal. Condyloma lata are smooth, moist, and flat, often located in the genital area, inner thighs, axillae, or oral mucosa. Unlike condyloma acuminata, condyloma lata may appear ulcerated. Microscopic examination reveals papillary, exophytic, treelike stromal cores covered by thickened squamous epithelium. Koilocytes are evident, featuring enlarged nuclei, hyperchromasia, and a perinuclear cytoplasmic halo. These are not precancerous lesions, and HPV vaccines provide excellent protection. HPV 16 and 18 (Option B): HPV 16 and 18 are high-risk strains responsible for cervical carcinoma, vulvar intraepithelial neoplasia (VIN) and vulvar carcinoma.",

Vaginal adenosis (precursor lesion for clear cell adenocarcinoma) refers to the presence of glandular columnar epithelium in the proximal vagina. Diethylstilbestrol is a synthetic non-steroidal estrogen that was historically widely used to prevent potential miscarriages by stimulating the synthesis of estrogen and progesterone in the placenta (especially from the 1940s to the 1970s).

      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: A) Cells with small protrusions of cytoplasm from one end. Explanation: The clinical presentation and IHC findings suggest Sarcoma botryoides, a rare type of Embryonal rhabdomyosarcoma, characterised by polypoid,rounded, bulky masses that have the appearance and consistency of grapelike clusters, commonly found in infants and children younger than 5 years of age. Histologically characterised by cells with small and oval nuclei with small protrusions of cytoplasm resembling a tennis racket (Tennis racket cells/ Tadpole cells) and rarely cytosolic striations (indicative of muscle differentiation) can be seen. The \"cambium layer\" in sarcoma botryoides refers to a band of undifferentiated or slightly differentiated tumour cells beneath the surface epithelium. Its presence aids in diagnosing sarcoma botryoides and distinguishing it from other vaginal tumours. Immunohistochemical staining is positive for Desmin/MyoD1. It tends to invade locally and cause death by penetration into the peritoneal cavity obstruction of the urinary tract.",

      "correct_answer": "D",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: D) Allows simultaneous HPV testing Explanation: Aspect Conventional Cervical Screening (Pap Smear) Liquid-Based Cytology (LBC) Sample Collection Cells are collected using a spatula or brush and smeared directly onto a glass slide. Cells are collected using a brush and then rinsed into a vial containing a preservative solution. Processing Time Typically longer due to manual preparation and staining. Faster automated processing and staining. Sensitivity and Specificity Lower sensitivity and specificity compared to LBC. Higher sensitivity and specificity for detecting abnormalities. Cost Generally lower cost. Higher cost due to specialized equipment and supplies. (Option A) Follow-up Testing Additional sample collection may be needed if the initial sample is inadequate. Usually provides enough samples for additional tests (e.g., HPV testing) without recollection.

      "correct_answer": "D",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: D) Koilocytes Explanation: Koilocytes are abnormal cervical cells seen on pap smears, indicative of HPV infections of the cervix. They are squamous epithelial cells with nuclear enlargement, coarse chromatin, perinuclear cavitation, and irregular nuclear membranes. A rim of condensed cytoplasm often surrounds the perinuclear cavitation, giving the cell a \"halo\" appearance. Doderlein cells (Option A): Doderlein cells are large, glycogen-rich squamous epithelial cells in the vaginal epithelium, associated with Lactobacillus species. A reduction or absence of Doderlein cells can indicate pathological conditions such as bacterial vaginosis. Hobnail cells (Option B): Hobnail cells are found in clear cell carcinoma of the ovary. Arias-Stella reaction cells (Option C): Arias-Stella reaction cells are a type of glandular epithelial cell found in the endometrium during pregnancy, ectopic pregnancy, or pathological conditions like gestational trophoblastic disease.",
