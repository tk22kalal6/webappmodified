      "explanation": "Correct Answer: A) B cells, no exposure to radiation Explanation: Based on the above scenario, the patient is most likely suffering from Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia. CLL is one of the cancers not associated with radiation exposure and originates from B cells. Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia Genetics: Trisomy 12, deletion 13q14 , and others Origin: Post–germinal center memory B cell or naive B Cells in the mantle zone of the lymph node (Option A) Etiopathogenesis Antiapoptotic protein BCL2 overexpression. CLL cell growth depends on Bruton Tyrosine kinase (BTK) activity. No association with radiation exposure (Options A and B) Clinical Presentation Most common leukemia in the elderly. Frequently asymptomatic at diagnosis. May present with fatigue, lymphadenopathy, hepatosplenomegaly, or infection due to immunosuppression. Associated with autoimmune hemolytic anemia- spherocytes can be seen on peripheral smear Can lead to Hypogammaglobulinemia as B cells are abnormal Infection is the M/C/C of death in CLL Laboratory diagnosis: Absolute lymphocyte count (ALC) > 5000/mm3 Bone marrow lymphocytes >30% Surface markers using flow cytometry positive for CD5, CD23, CD19, CD20. CLL co-expresses both T cell (CD5) and B cell (CD20, CD19) markers. Myeloid cells and Philadelphia chromosomes are seen in Chronic Myeloid Leukemia (Options C and D) .

      },
      "correct_answer": "D",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: D) CLL Explanation: The diagnosis is CLL due to the following laboratory findings: Absolute lymphocyte count (ALC) is significantly elevated (45,000/µL), a characteristic finding in CLL. Diagnostic ALC >5000/mm3. Total leukocyte count (TLC) is elevated (70,000/µL), consistent with leukemia. The differential leukocyte count (DLC) shows 70% lymphocytes, further supporting the CLL diagnosis. In CLL, there is a proliferation of mature-appearing lymphocytes. ALL ( Option A): ALL is characterised by the presence of a high blast count in the peripheral blood. The absence of blasts in the differential count and the presence of mature lymphocytes make ALL less likely. AML ( Option B): AML involves the rapid proliferation of myeloid blasts in the bone marrow, often leading to high leukocyte counts. While the leukocyte count is elevated in this case, the differential leukocyte count (DLC) shows mainly lymphocytes, which is not characteristic of AML. CML ( Option C): CML is characterised by the presence of the Philadelphia chromosome and the overproduction of mature and immature granulocytes. The absence of basophilia, thrombocytosis, and the predominance of lymphocytes in the differential count make CML less likely.

      "explanation": "Correct Answer: D) Di Guglielmo Disease Explanation: Based on the clinical presentation, laboratory findings, and HPE image, the patient's diagnosis is Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia (CLL). CLL is not associated with Di Guglielmo Disease. Di Guglielmo Disease, or acute erythroid leukemia, represents a subtype of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) characterised by the proliferation of erythroid precursors in the bone marrow. Autoimmune hemolytic anemia (AIHA) (Option A): AIHA is associated with CLL, sometimes occurring independently or in Evan’s syndrome, along with immune thrombocytopenia. It results from autoantibodies produced by malignant B cells. Peripheral smear may reveal spherocytes (round, hyperchromatic RBCs). Evan’s syndrome (Option B ): Evan’s syndrome is associated with CLL. It is characterised by the simultaneous or sequential presence of AIHA (Coomb’s positive) and immune thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP). Richter’s syndrome (Option C ): Richter’s syndrome, associated with CLL, involves the transformation of CLL into diffuse",

      "correct_answer": "D",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: D) Hypercellular bone marrow with decreased erythroid precursors Explanation: The features described in the scenario are consistent with Chronic Myeloid Leukemia (CML). CML typically presents with splenomegaly, high white blood cell counts, and a characteristic peripheral blood smear showing increased granulocytes at different stages of maturation. Bone Marrow aspirate findings of CML: Presence of scattered macrophages with abundant wrinkled, green-blue cytoplasm, called sea-blue histiocytes or pseudo-Gaucher cells. The marrow is markedly hypercellular due to massively increased numbers of maturing granulocytic precursors (elevated eosinophils and basophils) Increased megakaryocytes, commonly with small, dysplastic forms called dwarf megakaryocytes. Normal or slightly decreased erythroid progenitors (increased myeloid : erythroid ratio). Increased deposition of reticulin fibers. Diffusely effaced lymph node architecture with proliferation centers is seen in CLL (Option A) . Reed-Sternberg cells are pathognomonic for Hodgkin’s lymphoma (Option B) . Normal marrow cellularity with increased blast cells is seen in AML (Option C) .",

      },
      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: A) CD5+, CD19+, CD23+, CD10- Explanation: Lab investigations with CBC showing leukocytosis with ALC >=5000/mm3 points towards diagnosis of Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia (CLL) or Small Lymphocytic Lymphoma (SLL). It is characterised by specific cell surface markers detected via flow cytometry. The typical CLL immunophenotype includes CD5+, CD10-, CD19+, CD20+ (with dim expression), and CD23+. While CD5 is associated with T-cells, it's abnormally expressed in CLL. CD19 and CD20 are B-cell markers, with CD20 typically appearing dim in CLL. CD23 is also commonly found on CLL cells. Additionally, a new marker, CD200, is recorded positive in CLL, aiding in its diagnosis. CD20+, CD79a+, CD5+, CD25-: CD79a is more common in B-cell lymphomas, and CD25 can be seen in other diseases like hairy cell leukemia (Option B) . CD3+, CD5+, CD19+, CD20-: CD3 indicates a T-cell lineage, which is not characteristic of CLL (Option C) . CD10+, CD19+, CD22+, CD23-: CD10 and CD22 expression is more typical of precursor B-cell lymphoblastic leukemia/lymphoma. CD23 negativity is also inconsistent with CLL (Option D) .

      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: B) CML and Imatinib mesylate Explanation: This scenario is suggestive of chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) as the patient has a markedly elevated white blood cell (WBC) count, increased myeloid precursor forms, basophilia, and eosinophilia in the peripheral blood smear, and a low LAP score. CML Genetics: Philadelphia chromosome (t(9;22)) Origin: Myeloid lineage Etiopathogenesis: BCR-ABL fusion gene due to t(9;22) causes tyrosine kinase activity much above normal Radiation exposure Clinical features: Occurs in adults. Often presents with splenomegaly, fatigue, weight loss, night sweats, and abdominal discomfort. Can progress to a blast crisis with features of acute leukemia. Diagnosis: Bone marrow aspirate to confirm diagnosis FISH - presence of BCR ABL fusion gene product. Management: Tyrosine kinase inhibitors such as Imatinib (Option B) Leukemoid reaction (Option A): LAP score is increased in leukemoid reaction, and basophilia is not seen. It is usually due to underlying infections and treated with antibiotics. ALL and vincristine (Option C): Typically, acute lymphoblastic leukemia, which is more common in young children, is characterised by having over 20% bone marrow lymphoblasts and is treated with chemotherapy. AML and stem cell transplant (Option D): Most patients present with a WBC count of approximately 15,000-20,000/mm³ and a significant increase in blast cells (e.g., >20%), unlike the 1% seen in this patient and treated with stem cell transplant.

      "explanation": "Correct Answer: A) Progression to accelerated phase CML Explanation: This patient's increasing anemia and thrombocytopenia, accompanied by a rise in the number of basophils in the blood and a blast percentage of 12%, is consistent with the accelerated phase of CML. The 3 phases of CML and their characteristics are: 1) Chronic phase: Leukocytosis, < 10% blast cells, basophils <20% and monocytosis < 3% 2) Accelerated phase: 10%-19% blasts, ≥ 20% basophils in the peripheral blood or bone marrow Persistent or increasing WBC (>10 × 10^9/L) and splenomegaly, unresponsive to therapy Persistent thrombocytosis (>1000 × 10^9/L), unresponsive to therapy Persistent thrombocytopenia (<100 × 10^9/L) unrelated to therapy This phase often leads to the terminal blast crisis within 6-12 months 3) Blast Crisis: ≥ 20% blasts in peripheral blood or bone marrow In 50% of patients, the blast crisis occurs abruptly without an accelerated phase Extensive extramedullary hematopoiesis occurs to compensate for CML and leads to significant splenomegaly Transformation into AML is more predominant than ALL Reference: Robbin’s and Cotran Pathological Basis of Disease, 10th Edition, Page 623 https://doi.org/10.1182/blood-2016-03-643544 https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0006497120301567",
