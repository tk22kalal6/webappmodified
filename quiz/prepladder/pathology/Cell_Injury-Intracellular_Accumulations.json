      "explanation": "Correct Answer: D) Coal worker’s pneumoconiosis Explanation: Exogenous pigments Endogenous pigments They originate from external sources and are introduced into the body through environmental exposure or ingestion. They are naturally produced within the body as a result of metabolic processes. E.g. Carbon pigment (exogenous carbon or coal dust) Tattoo ink (skin tattooing) E.g.

      "question": "A 83-year-old man presents to his gastroenterologist with complaints of fatigue and discomfort in the upper abdomen. He has a history of hypertension and type 2 diabetes mellitus, for which he takes medications regularly. On physical examination, the liver edge is palpable below the right costal margin, indicating hepatomegaly. Laboratory investigations reveal mildly elevated liver enzymes.

        "C": "Lipofuscin",
        "D": "Bilirubin"
      },
      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: C) Lipofuscin Explanation: Lipofuscin, also known as lipochrome or wear-and-tear pigment, is an insoluble pigment derived from the peroxidation of polyunsaturated lipids in intracellular membranes. It is a telltale sign of free radical injury and lipid peroxidation. It is responsible for the brown atrophy of the liver and heart, where lipofuscin accumulates in the hepatocytes and cardiac myocytes, respectively, due to oxidative damage and impaired cellular turnover, particularly with increasing age. It is also seen in senile atrophy. In histopathological examination, it appears as a yellow-brown, finely granular cytoplasmic pigment, often deposited in the perinuclear region. The special stain used for lipofuscin is Oil red O. Reference: Robbins and Cotran pathologic basis of disease, 10th edition, Page 76, 77",

      "question": "A 45-year-old man presents with complaints of fatigue, joint pain, and abdominal discomfort.

      },
      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: A) Perl’s stain Explanation: Perl's stain, also known as Prussian Blue stain is the stain used to detect hemosiderin. The given clinical scenario suggests the patient is suffering from Hemochromatosis, an iron overload disorder in which excessive iron is deposited in various tissues as hemosiderin, a golden yellow to brown, granular, or crystalline pigment. Hemochromatosis can be hereditary or secondary to conditions such as chronic liver disease, frequent blood transfusions, or excessive iron intake. Lillie's stain (Option B): Lillie's stain also known as Lillie-Mayer's hematoxylin-eosin stain might help in detecting Ferrous ions (Fe2+) but is not useful for hemosiderin, which is ferric iron (Fe3+) Rhodanine stain (Option C): Rhodanine is utilized as a selective stain for the detection and localization of copper ions that accumulate in tissues such as the liver and brain in copper metabolism disorders, such as Wilson's disease. Supravital stains (Option D) : Supravital stains are a group of dyes used to stain living cells or tissues without causing cell death. New methylene blue and Brilliant cresyl blue target ribonucleic acid residues in reticulocytes and provide the characteristic blue reticular staining pattern.

      "explanation": "Correct Answer: A) Diphtheria myocarditis Explanation: Fat accumulation in the heart gives a characteristic Tigroid or Tabby cat appearance, which appears as yellowish streaks (fatty change) alternating with reddish streaks (unaffected myocardium). This appearance is seen in conditions such as Diphtheria myocarditis, Arrhythmogenic Right Ventricular Cardiomyopathy (ARVCM), and cell injury. Xanthomas (Option B): Xanthomas are found in skin and in tendons. Cholesterolosis (Option C): Cholesterolosis refers to the cholesterol-laden macrophages in the lamina propria of the gallbladder aka strawberry gallbladder.

      "explanation": "Correct Answer: C) Crooke hyaline change Explanation: Crooke hyaline change is a histopathological finding seen in the pituitary gland, particularly in corticotroph adenomas associated with Cushing's disease. In crooke hyaline change, normal granular, basophilic cytoplasm of ACTH-producing cells becomes homogenous and paler due to the accumulation of intermediate keratin filaments. These changes occur as a response to chronic hypercortisolism. Mallory-Denk bodies (Option A): Mallory-Denk bodies or Mallory hyaline bodies are eosinophilic, intracytoplasmic inclusions composed of intermediate filaments, particularly cytokeratin 8 and 18, commonly seen in hepatocytes in conditions such as alcoholic liver disease.

Metastatic calcification may occur in normal tissues whenever there is hypercalcemia. There are four principal causes of hypercalcemia: Increased secretion of parathyroid hormone (PTH) with subsequent bone resorption, as in hyperparathyroidism due to parathyroid tumours, and ectopic secretion of PTH-related protein by malignant tumours Resorption of bone tissue, secondary to primary tumours of bone marrow (e.g., multiple myeloma, leukaemia) or diffuse skeletal metastasis (e.g., breast cancer), accelerated bone turnover (e.g., Paget disease), or immobilization. Vitamin D–related disorders, including vitamin D intoxication, sarcoidosis (in which macrophages activate a vitamin D precursor), and idiopathic hypercalcemia of infancy (Williams syndrome), characterized by abnormal sensitivity to vitamin D Renal failure, which causes retention of phosphate, leads to secondary hyperparathyroidism.
