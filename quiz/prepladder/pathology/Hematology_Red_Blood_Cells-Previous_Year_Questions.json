      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: B) Iron deficiency Explanation: This patient’s symptoms with a history of poor dietary habits and laboratory findings of Hb 9 g/dL with an MCV of 80 fl (microcytic anaemia) strongly suggest iron deficiency anaemia . Iron deficiency anaemia can result from dietary lack, impaired absorption, increased iron requirement (e.g., during pregnancy), or chronic blood loss (e.g., gastrointestinal bleeding). Clinical features include Koilonychia, alopecia, atrophic glossitis, esophageal webs, pica and intestinal malabsorption, affecting overall nutritional status. Cyanocobalamin deficiency (Option A) causes megaloblastic anemia , which typically presents with macrocytic anemia (elevated MCV), not the microcytic anemia seen in this patient. Folic acid deficiency (Option B) also causes megaloblastic anemia , which presents with macrocytic anemia (high MCV), not microcytic anemia . Hereditary spherocytosis (Option D) is a condition where red blood cells are abnormally shaped (spherocytes), leading to hemolysis and normocytic anemia (normal MCV).

      },
      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: A) Idiopathic acquired aplastic anemia Explanation: The patient presents with gum bleeding, prolonged fever, pallor, and pancytopenia. Bone marrow examination shows fatty streaks, a lack of megakaryocytes, and no immature cells, suggesting idiopathic acquired aplastic anemia, where bone marrow failure leads to hematologic abnormalities. Aplastic anaemia is a condition of primary hematopoietic failure resulting in pancytopenia (anaemia, neutropenia, thrombocytopenia), often due to autoimmune mechanisms or inherited/acquired abnormalities in hematopoietic stem cells. Etiology: Common causes: Chemical and drug exposure (e.g., chemotherapy, benzene) Viral infections (e.g., hepatitis, linked to 5% of cases) Radiation exposure (e.g., therapeutic or nuclear accidents) Genetic causes: Fanconi anaemia : Rare autosomal recessive disorder with congenital anomalies (kidney, spleen hypoplasia, bone anomalies). Telomerase defects : Found in 5-10% of adult-onset cases, causing premature exhaustion of hematopoietic stem cells. Idiopathic cases: No identifiable cause in ~65% of cases. Morphology: Bone Marrow: Hypocellular marrow with fat cells, fibrous stroma, and scattered lymphocytes/plasma cells. \"Dry tap\" on marrow aspirates (due to lack of hematopoietic cells). Peripheral Blood: Macrocytic , normochromic red cells with reticulocytopenia . Granulocytopenia (leading to infections) and thrombocytopenia (leading to bleeding). Clinical features: Onset: Insidious, with progressive pancytopenia. Anaemia : Weakness, pallor, dyspnea. Thrombocytopenia : Petechiae, ecchymosis. Neutropenia : Frequent infections, chills, fever. Splenomegaly : Generally absent. Red Cells : Slightly macrocytic and normochromic. Diagnosis: Based on bone marrow biopsy , showing hypocellularity . Must differentiate from other causes of pancytopenia, like leukaemia or myelodysplastic syndrome, where the marrow is typically hypercellular. Paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH) (Option B) is a rare acquired disorder where red blood cells are destroyed by complement. It often presents with hemolysis and episodes of dark urine, especially at night. The peripheral smear in PNH shows evidence of hemolysis and pancytopenia, but bone marrow findings would not show fatty streaks with a lack of megakaryocytes, as in this case. Myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) (Option C) typically presents with cytopenias and abnormal blood cell morphology. Bone marrow findings in MDS often show dysplastic changes in blood cells, which would not correlate with the lack of immature cells seen here. Additionally, the absence of megakaryocytes and the presence of fatty streaks suggest aplasia rather than dysplastic hematopoiesis. Tuberculosis (TB) (Option D): While TB can cause systemic symptoms like fever and weight loss, it is not typically associated with pancytopenia, macrocytic anaemia, and bone marrow findings of fatty streaks with a lack of megakaryocytes. TB may affect bone marrow in disseminated forms, but the presentation and lab findings here point more to an intrinsic hematopoietic failure like aplastic anaemia.",

        "D": "Howell-Jolly bodies"
      },
      "correct_answer": "D",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: D) Howell-Jolly bodies Explanation: The clinical presentation, along with microscopic findings, indicates hereditary spherocytosis. Howell-Jolly bodies, remnants of nuclear material normally removed by the spleen, persist in red blood cells in splenectomised patients and can be seen on a peripheral blood smear. Hereditary spherocytosis (HS) is an inherited disorder caused by intrinsic defects in the red cell membrane skeleton that render red cells spheroid, less deformable, and vulnerable to splenic sequestration and destruction. It has an autosomal dominant inheritance(75%) characterised by ankyrin mutation and an autosomal recessive inheritance characterised by spectrin mutation. Pathophysiology of hereditary spherocytosis: The most specific morphologic finding is spherocytosis: Dark-staining (hyperchromic) spherocytes lacking the central zone of pallor. Other features include reticulocytosis. The characteristic clinical features are anaemia, splenomegaly, jaundice, and an increased risk of gallstones. Severity ranges from asymptomatic to severe hemolytic anaemia requiring transfusions. Early complications include neonatal jaundice and hemolytic crises. Late complications include gallstones and rarely iron overload. Decreased osmotic fragility (Option A): In hereditary spherocytosis, osmotic fragility increases , not decreases. Red blood cells are more prone to bursting in hypotonic solutions. Decreased reticulocytes (Option B): Reticulocyte count is typically increased in hereditary spherocytosis, especially in cases of hemolysis, as the bone marrow compensates by producing more immature red",

      "explanation": "Correct Answer: B) Leukemia Explanation: Leukaemia is not likely to be seen in a patient with Paroxysmal Nocturnal Hemoglobinuria (PNH). It is a rare acquired hematopoietic stem cell disorder characterized by a deficiency of glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI)-anchored proteins on the surface of blood cells, particularly red blood cells. PNH blood cells are deficient in three GPI-linked proteins that regulate complement activity: CD55 (decay-accelerating factor) CD59 (membrane inhibitor of reactive lysis) C8-binding protein. Pathogenesis: It results from acquired mutations in the phosphatidylinositol glycan complementation group A gene (PIGA), an enzyme that is essential for the synthesis of certain membrane-associated complement regulatory proteins. Clinical features: It causes intravascular hemolysis and anaemia.

        "A": "Ferritin translation is increased by binding IRP to IRE",

        "D": "Transferrin receptor 1 translation is decreased by binding IRP to IRE"
      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: B) Ferritin translation is decreased by binding IRP to IRE Explanation: In iron deficiency anaemia, ferritin translation is decreased by binding iron regulatory protein to iron response elements. Iron regulatory mechanism: IRP: Binds to IREs in specific mRNAs' untranslated regions (UTRs) to control the translation of proteins involved in iron metabolism. IRE: These are sequences found in the mRNAs of proteins involved in iron metabolism, such as ferritin and transferrin receptor 1 Ferritin: Ferritin stores iron inside cells. When iron levels are low, IRPs bind to IREs in the 5' UTR of ferritin mRNA, preventing its translation to conserve iron. Transferrin receptor 1 (TfR1): TfR1 imports iron into cells. When intracellular iron levels are low, IRP binds to the IRE in the ferritin mRNA, preventing its translation. This leads to a decrease in the production of ferritin, which helps conserve iron and prevent its storage when it is limited. Ferritin translation is increased by binding IRP to IRE (Option A): In iron deficiency anaemia, the binding of IRP to the IRE in the mRNA of ferritin leads to a decrease in ferritin translation to conserve iron and prevents its storage when it is limited. Transferrin receptor 1 translation is unaffected by binding IRP to IRE (Option C): In iron deficiency, IRP binds to the IRE in the mRNA of TfR1, stabilizing the mRNA and increasing its translation, resulting in an increased production of TfR1, which enhances the uptake of iron into cells to compensate for the deficiency. Transferrin receptor 1 translation is decreased by binding IRP to IRE (Option D): In iron deficiency anaemia, the binding of IRP to the IRE in the mRNA of TfR1 leads to an increased translation of TfR1, facilitating the increased uptake of iron into cells to overcome the deficiency.

      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: B) Aplastic anemia Explanation: Massive splenomegaly, often linked to haematological disorders, is not typically associated with Aplastic Anemia, a bone marrow failure condition characterized by reduced production of blood cells. Aplastic Anemia It refers to a syndrome of chronic primary hematopoietic failure and attendant pancytopenia. Cause Acquired Idiopathic Acquired stem cell defects Immune-mediated Chemical agents Dose-related (Alkylating agents, antimetabolites, benzene, chloramphenicol, inorganic arsenicals) Idiosyncratic (Chloramphenicol, phenylbutazone, organic arsenicals, methylphenylethylhydantoin, carbamazepine, penicillamine, gold salts) Physical agents Whole-body irradiation Viral infections Hepatitis (unknown virus) Cytomegalovirus infections Epstein-Barr virus infections Herpes zoster (varicella zoster) Inherited Fanconi anemia Telomerase defects Pathogenesis The pathogenesis of aplastic anaemia is not fully understood. However, two major etiologies have been invoked: Extrinsic (immune-mediated suppression of marrow progenitors) Intrinsic (abnormality of stem cells) Clinical features Onset: Insidious. Pancytopenia Anaemia (progressive weakness, pallor, and dyspnea) Thrombocytopenia (petechiae and ecchymoses) Neutropenia (frequent and persistent infections or the sudden onset of chills, fever, and prostration). Splenomegaly is absent (Option B) The red cells are usually slightly macrocytic and normochromic. Microscopy Hypocellular bone marrow is largely devoid of hematopoietic cells; often, only fat cells, fibrous stroma, and scattered lymphocytes and plasma cells remain. Marrow aspirates often yield little material (a “dry tap”). Chronic myeloid leukaemia (Option A): Extensive extramedullary hematopoiesis often results in significant splenomegaly. Bone marrow findings typically include hypercellularity, an increased myeloid-to-erythroid ratio, and the presence of dwarf megakaryocytes. Additionally, sea-blue histiocytes, also known as pseudo-Gaucher cells, may be observed in the marrow. Hairy cell leukaemia (Option C) presents with fatigue, recurrent infections, easy bruising, and symptoms related to splenomegaly, such as early satiety and abdominal discomfort, along with pancytopenia. Peripheral smear typically shows \"hairy cells\" with round, oblong, or reniform nuclei and pale blue cytoplasm. Bone marrow findings often reveal hypocellular or fibrotic marrow with \"hairy cells\" and a characteristic \"fried egg\" appearance. Lymphoma (Option D) is cancer that originates in the lymphatic system, part of the immune system, and involves the uncontrolled growth of lymphocytes (a type of white blood cell). It can present with splenomegaly. The two main types are Hodgkin lymphoma (HL), characterized by Reed-Sternberg cells, and Non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL).",

      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: B) 1 & 2 are correct Explanation: 1 & 2 statements are correct regarding Glucose-6-phosphate Dehydrogenase (G6PD) Deficiency. It is an X-linked recessive disorder. Pathogenesis: It is characterized by a deficiency in the G6PD enzyme, which protects red blood cells from oxidative damage. This reduces the ability to generate NADPH (Statement 2) via the pentose phosphate pathway and impairs glutathione regeneration (Statement 1), exacerbating oxidative stress and hemolysis. When exposed to oxidative stressors, there is an imbalance between the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and antioxidants that neutralize them. This leads to oxidative damage to red blood cell membranes and proteins, resulting in hemolysis. (Statement 4) Clinical features: Episodes of acute hemolytic anaemia triggered by oxidative stressors such as infections, certain medications (e.g., antimalarials, sulfonamides), or ingestion of certain foods (e.g., fava beans). Fatigue, pallor, jaundice, and dark urine (due to hemoglobinuria). The severity of hemolysis varies depending on the degree of enzyme deficiency and the magnitude of the oxidative insult, with some individuals experiencing life-threatening hemolytic crises. G6PD deficiency causes both intra and extravascular hemolysis. Decreased lipid peroxidation (Statement 3): G6PD deficiency does not directly lead to a reduction in lipid peroxidation. On the contrary, it can increase susceptibility to oxidative stress and the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS). The reduced levels of NADPH and glutathione in G6PD deficiency impair the cell's antioxidant defence mechanisms, resulting in enhanced lipid peroxidation and oxidative damage.",

      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: B) Vitamin B6 Explanation: The treatment of Sideroblastic Anemia involves the use of vitamin B6 (pyridoxine). Sideroblastic Anemia It is a condition characterized by defective heme synthesis in the bone marrow, leading to the accumulation of iron within the mitochondria of red blood cell precursors (sideroblasts). Causes Congenital causes: Due to enzyme deficiencies like ALA synthase, ferrochelatase, etc. Acquired causes Vitamin B6 deficiency Drugs like isoniazid and chloramphenicol Lead and alcohol poisoning Pathogenesis Vitamin B6 is crucial for the proper function of enzymes in heme synthesis. As a cofactor for aminolevulinic acid synthase, it aids in the first step of heme production. Ensuring sufficient vitamin B6 restores enzyme activity, supports heme synthesis, and helps alleviate symptoms of sideroblastic anaemia. Microscopy Peripheral Smear: Pappenheimer bodies Multiple basophilic iron aggregates Stain blue with Perl's/ Prussian blue Seen in sideroblastic anaemia, lead poisoning, or hemochromatosis Bone Marrow: Ringed Sideroblasts Blue granules form a full or partial ring Blasts have a nucleus Iron is present in mitochondria in the perinuclear region. Stain blue on Perl's/Prussian blue. Seen with Sideroblastic anemia and Myelodysplastic syndrome. Associated with SF3B1 mutation Vitamin B1 (Option C), or thiamine, plays a key role in carbohydrate metabolism and nerve function. Its deficiency causes conditions like Wernicke-Korsakoff syndrome and Beriberi, but it is not linked to sideroblastic anaemia. Vitamin B12 (Option A) deficiency causes megaloblastic anaemia and neurological symptoms. It results from poor diet, malabsorption, or lack of intrinsic factors. In sideroblastic anaemia, vitamin B6 is used instead of vitamin B12 because it helps correct the heme synthesis defect, while B12 is not involved in this process. Iron (Option D) deficiency presents with symptoms like pale skin, shortness of breath, dizziness or lightheadedness, brittle nails, headaches, restless legs syndrome, etc. In sideroblastic anaemia, treatment focuses on addressing the underlying cause, as the main issue is impaired heme synthesis. Iron supplementation is generally ineffective and may worsen the condition by increasing iron accumulation in tissues.",

      "explanation": "Correct Answer: A) Idiopathic acquired aplastic anemia Explanation: The clinical presentation of gum bleeding, fever, pallor, severe anaemia, leukopenia, and thrombocytopenia, along with the findings of peripheral smear and bone marrow biopsy, strongly point toward idiopathic acquired aplastic anaemia (AAA). Aplastic Anemia is characterised by bone marrow failure, where the bone marrow does not produce enough blood cells, leading to Pancytopenia. In severe cases, the bone marrow may become hypocellular , making it difficult to aspirate sufficient material, leading to a dry tap. The absence of immature cells and the presence of fatty streaks in the bone marrow suggests bone marrow failure , typical of aplastic anemia, where normal hematopoiesis is replaced by fat. Paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (Option B) is a rare disorder that causes red blood cells to prematurely break down by the complement system. It is characterised by hemolytic anemia and hemoglobinuria. The peripheral smear shows evidence of hemolysis, which is not the case here. Myelodysplastic syndrome (Option C) is a group of disorders characterised by ineffective hematopoiesis and dysplastic cells in the bone marrow. While MDS can cause pancytopenia, it would typically show dysplastic features in the marrow, including abnormal shapes of cells, which is not the case here. Tuberculosis (Option D) is an infectious disease caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis that is not commonly associated with severe pancytopenia, fatty marrow, or absence of megakaryocytes. TB-related bone marrow suppression would usually have other findings like granulomas .",

      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: B) Bite cells are present Explanation: In glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency , oxidative stress leads to the formation of bite cells (also called degmacytes) due to the removal of damaged portions of the cell membrane. Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency is an inherited enzyme affecting red blood cells. Caused by a lack of the G6PD enzyme, which protects red blood cells from oxidative damage. Oxidative stress makes red blood cells vulnerable, leading to hemolysis. A characteristic feature is the presence of bite cells (degmacytes). Heinz bodies, formed from denatured haemoglobin, are not visible with Romanowsky stains. When Romanowsky stains are used, the denatured haemoglobin may not be detected, resulting in the appearance of bite cells. Abnormality Condition Reason Bite cells G6PD deficiency Oxidative stress leads to cross-linking of sulfhydryl groups in haemoglobin → Denaturation of haemoglobin → Heinz bodies. RBCs with Heinz bodies pass through the spleen → Splenic macrophages try to pluck these Heinz bodies → Membrane loss → Bite cells . Target cells Thalassemia ↓ Haemoglobin content in RBCs → ↓ RBC volume → Surface area relatively unchanged → ↑ Surface area to volume ratio → Altered lipid composition → ↑ Formation of membrane protrusions → ↑ Membrane instability → ↓ Hemoglobin accumulation in certain membrane areas → Central area with haemoglobin, clear zone, outer ring. Uneven distribution of haemoglobin and lipids → Characteristic \"bull's-eye\" appearance of Target cells Sickle-shaped RBC Sickle Cell Anemia Abnormal Hemoglobin (HbS) → HbS molecules polymerize under low oxygen → RBCs become rigid and assume a sickle shape. Spherocytes Hereditary Spherocytosis Genetic defect in RBC membrane protein(spectrin) I Loss of membrane surface area I RBCs become spherical. Spectrin defect (Option A) is a structural protein that maintains the shape and flexibility of red blood cells. Deficiency of spectrin is seen in hereditary spherocytosis , not G6PD deficiency. Cells do not lyse in hypotonic solution (Option C): In G6PD deficiency, red blood cells are more likely to lyse in hypotonic solutions due to their increased vulnerability to oxidative stress. Cells lyse in hypertonic solution (Option D): Red blood cells do not typically lyse in hypertonic solutions; instead, they undergo crenation. The lysis occurs more readily in hypotonic solutions, especially in G6PD deficiency.",

      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: C) Iron deficiency anemia Explanation: The image shows koilonychia, a concave nail deformity with raised edges, commonly seen in iron deficiency anaemia. The patient's fatigue and pallor further support this diagnosis. Iron deficiency anaemia: Iron deficiency anaemia can result from dietary lack, impaired absorption, increased iron requirement (e.g., during pregnancy), or chronic blood loss (e.g., gastrointestinal bleeding). Clinical features include Koilonychia , alopecia, atrophic glossitis, oesophagal webs, pica and intestinal malabsorption, affecting overall nutritional status. Characteristic changes seen in peripheral smear: Hypochromic: The RBCs appear pale due to decreased haemoglobin content. Microcytic: RBCs are smaller than normal due to decreased haemoglobin synthesis. Anisocytosis: There is significant variation in the size of RBCs. Poikilocytosis: RBCs may show abnormal shapes, such as pencil cells, target cells (codocytes), and occasionally, elliptocytes. Iron Study Interpretation in Iron Deficiency Anemia Serum Ferritin Low (< 30 ng/mL) indicates depleted iron stores. Serum Iron (Fe) Low levels are seen in iron deficiency anaemia. Total Iron Binding Capacity (TIBC) Increased TIBC reflects the increased capacity of transferrin to bind iron in response to low iron stores. Red Cell Distribution Width (RDW) Increased RDW is often seen in iron deficiency anaemia Bone Marrow Aspiration and Iron Staining Confirmatory test Aplastic anaemia (Option A) is a condition where the bone marrow fails to produce enough blood cells, resulting in a reduction of red blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets.

      },
      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: A) Polycythemia vera Explanation: In polycythemia vera (>95% cases) , the JAK2 mutation leads to the persistent activation of the JAK-STAT signalling pathway, resulting in the uncontrolled proliferation and survival of red blood cell precursors. This overproduction increases red blood cell count in the bloodstream, leading to blood thickening and potential complications like thrombosis. Essential thrombocytosis (Option B) is characterized by the overproduction of platelets in the bone marrow, increasing the risk of abnormal blood clotting. Although JAK2 mutations can occur in essential thrombocytosis, they are less frequent compared to polycythemia vera. Chronic myelogenous leukaemia (CML) (Option C) is primarily associated with the Philadelphia chromosome, which results from a reciprocal translocation between chromosomes 9 and 22. This translocation leads to the creation of the BCR-ABL fusion gene, which causes uncontrolled proliferation of myeloid cells. Primary myelofibrosis (PMF) (Option D) involves the excessive production of abnormal blood cells, often leading to fibrosis (scarring) of the bone marrow. JAK2 mutations can also occur in primary myelofibrosis, though they are less common than in polycythemia vera. Reference: Robbins & Cotran Pathologic Basis of Disease, 10th Edition, Page 622",

      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: A) Vitamin B12 deficiency Explanation: Vitamin B12 deficiency is commonly associated with macrocytic anemia, which is characterized by the presence of macrocytes and hypersegmented neutrophils on the peripheral blood smears. It can be caused by atrophic gastritis , which leads to impaired absorption of B12 due to reduced intrinsic factor production. Atrophic gastritis is frequently seen in pernicious anemia , a common cause of vitamin B12 deficiency. Causes of Vitamin B12 deficiency: Reduced Dietary Intake Increased demand Impaired Absorption Vegetarian diet Pregnancy Lactation Growing child Pernicious anemia (Option A) Infections- Diphyllobothrium latum (Option C) Gastrectomy (Option:D) Ileal disorders Malabsorption Ileal resection Diverticula of bowel Folate deficiency (Option B) can cause macrocytic anemia and hypersegmented neutrophils. However, it is less commonly associated with atrophic gastritis, and the absence of other features like neural tube defects (in pregnancy) makes it less likely in this case. Pyridoxine deficiency (Option C) (Vitamin B6) deficiency causes microcytic anemia and not macrocytic anemia and is unlikely to explain the findings of macrocytes and hypersegmented neutrophils. Niacin deficiency (Option D) (Vitamin B3) deficiency causes pellagra , which is characterised by the \"three D's\": dermatitis, diarrhea, and dementia.

      "explanation": "Correct Answer D - Chronic alcoholism Explanation: The patient presents with macrocytic anemia (MCV = 101 fL) and peripheral smear findings of macrocytic RBCs and hypersegmented neutrophils, which strongly indicate megaloblastic anemia. This condition is most commonly caused by deficiencies in vitamin B12 or folate , often due to poor dietary intake, malabsorption, or chronic alcohol use. Chronic alcohol consumption is a well-known cause of macrocytic anemia, either due to direct toxic effects on hematopoiesis or through the development of folate deficiency , a key cause of megaloblastic anemia. Lead poisoning (Option A) typically causes microcytic anemia due to interference with heme synthesis. Iron deficiency anemia (Option B) is characterised by microcytic, hypochromic anaemia resulting from reduced haemoglobin production. Hemolytic anemia (Option C) may cause mild macrocytosis due to increased reticulocyte production; hypersegmented neutrophils are not seen.

      "explanation": "Correct Answer: C) Thalassemia Explanation: Thalassemia Major ( β -Thalassemia Major) Features Description Definition A severe form of β -thalassemia caused by homozygous or compound heterozygous mutations in the β -globin gene (HBB) on chromosome 11, leading to absent or markedly reduced β -globin chain production. Genetics Autosomal recessive disorder, caused by mutations in the β -globin gene leading to defective hemoglobin synthesis. Pathophysiology Reduced or absent β -globin chains lead to excess α -globin chains, which form unstable precipitates, causing ineffective erythropoiesis, hemolysis, and severe anaemia. Clinical Features Symptoms appear around 6 months of age (as fetal haemoglobin declines); severe anaemia, growth retardation, hepatosplenomegaly, skeletal deformities (crew-cut appearance on skull X-ray, frontal bossing), jaundice, and delayed puberty. Hematological Findings Peripheral smear : Microcytic hypochromic anaemia, target cells, anisopoikilocytosis, nucleated RBCs. Bone marrow : Erythroid hyperplasia with expansion of marrow cavities. Hemoglobin Electrophoresis Absent or very low HbA, markedly increased HbF (>90%), variable HbA2. Complications Iron overload (due to repeated transfusions leading to secondary hemochromatosis) Cardiac failure (due to iron deposition) E ndocrinopathies (diabetes, hypothyroidism, hypogonadism) Osteopenia/osteoporosis I ncreased infection risk (especially from Yersinia and viral infections). Diagnosis Blood tests (CBC, peripheral smear), Hb electrophoresis/HPLC , Serum ferritin (for iron overload), Genetic testing (HBB gene mutations), Prenatal diagnosis (chorionic villus sampling or amniocentesis). Treatment Regular blood transfusions , iron chelation therapy (deferoxamine, deferasirox, deferiprone), splenectomy (in refractory cases), and hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) (only curative option). Prevention Carrier screening, genetic counselling, prenatal diagnosis, preimplantation genetic diagnosis (PGD) in high-risk couples. The Mentzer index (MCV/RBC count) helps distinguish IDA from beta-thalassemia minor , with a value <13 suggesting beta-thalassemia minor . An elevated RDW favours IDA in microcytic, hypochromic anaemia. Confirmatory test: Hemoglobin electrophoresis showing HbA I >3.5% confirms beta-thalassemia minor.

      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "high hemoglobin, and increased TLC with a predominance of neutrophils and myeloid cells suggests reactive or secondary polycythemia. In this context, it is important to assess the erythropoietin levels. In reactive polycythemia, EPO levels are expected to be low or normal due to an appropriate physiological response to hypoxia. If EPO levels are elevated, it would raise concerns for primary polycythemia such as polycythemia vera or an EPO-secreting tumor Incorrect Option: Option A : Philadelphia chromosome is a genetic abnormality associated with chronic myeloid leukemia (CML), a type of blood cancer. However, the given clinical presentation with high hemoglobin, increased total leukocyte count (TLC), and presence of myelocytes and metamyelocytes in the peripheral smear does not suggest CML. Therefore, investigating the Philadelphia chromosome is not indicated in this case. Option B : JAK mutation refers to mutations in the Janus kinase (JAK) genes, which can be seen in certain myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPNs) such as polycythemia vera, essential thrombocythemia, and primary myelofibrosis. While the peripheral smear findings of increased myelocytes and metamyelocytes may raise suspicion for an MPN, the high haemoglobin level and low leukocyte count are not consistent with these disorders. Therefore, investigating JAK mutation is not the most appropriate next step. Option D: Bone marrow biopsy with reticulin stain is a more invasive and specific investigation that may be considered if the initial workup, including EPO levels, is inconclusive or if there are additional findings suggestive of a myeloproliferative disorder or myelodysplastic syndrome. However, in the given clinical scenario of a young boy with high haemoglobin, increased TLC with myeloid predominance, and weakness, the more appropriate initial step is to assess EPO levels before proceeding to a bone marrow biopsy. Therefore, the correct option is C, to measure the erythropoietin levels. Reference: .",

      "explanation": "Correct Answer: A) PNH Explanation: Paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH) is a rare acquired condition marked by clonal expansion of hematopoietic stem cells lacking GPI anchor proteins and is not a hereditary cause of thrombosis. PNH blood cells are deficient in three GPI-linked proteins that regulate complement activity: CD55 (decay-accelerating factor) CD59 (membrane inhibitor of reactive lysis) C8-binding protein. Pathogenesis: It results from acquired mutations in the phosphatidylinositol glycan complementation group A gene (PIGA), an enzyme that is essential for the synthesis of certain membrane-associated complement regulatory proteins. Clinical features: It causes intravascular haemolysis and anaemia Haemoglobinuria (red-brown colour) (most noticeable in early morning urine) Hypoplastic bone marrow failure, aplastic anaemia and myelodysplastic syndrome Management Transfusion Folate supplements Prophylaxis or treatment of thrombosis Anti-complement C5 monoclonal antibody. Protein S deficiency (Option B) is a genetic disorder that increases the risk of abnormal blood clotting (thrombosis). Protein C and its co-factor protein S are vitamin K-dependent natural anticoagulants involved in switching off coagulation factor activation (factors Va and VIIIa) and thrombin generation. Deficiency can lead to deep vein thrombosis (DVT), pulmonary embolism (PE), and other thrombotic events. Antithrombin deficiency (Option C) is an autosomal dominant inherited disorder that heightens the risk of abnormal blood clotting (thrombosis). Antithrombin (AT) is a serine protease inhibitor (SERPIN) that inactivates activated coagulation factors IIa, IXa, Xa, and XIa. A deficiency in AT can result in deep vein thrombosis (DVT), pulmonary embolism (PE), and other thrombotic events. Heparins and fondaparinux enhance AT activity to exert their therapeutic effects. Homocystinuria (Option D) is an autosomal recessive disorder caused by mutations in the CBS gene, leading to cystathionine β -synthase deficiency that results in the accumulation of homocysteine and methionine in the blood. Symptoms include lens dislocation (ectopia lentis), intellectual disability, seizures, skeletal abnormalities similar to Marfan's syndrome, osteoporosis, thrombosis, and hyperpigmentation.

Complications Acute Painful Episodes (Vaso-Occlusive Crisis) Characterised by unprovoked, severe, symmetrical pain often requiring strong opioids The most common acute event in sickle cell disease. Lasting from days to weeks. Sudden death during acute pain episodes can occur, possibly due to arrhythmias or pulmonary embolism. Acute Chest Syndrome: Symptoms include chest pain, cough, fever, hypoxia, and pulmonary infiltrates on x-ray. It can be mild in children (e.g., due to viral infections) or severe with multiple lobes affected. Thrombocytopenia, leukocytosis, and rapid anaemia suggest severe complications like acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and multiorgan failure. Osteonecrosis: Involves the hips bilaterally . Chronic pain can progress to severe disability; MRI detects early stages, while X-rays are less sensitive. Leg ulcer: Ulcers range from small and superficial to deep, covering most of the lower leg. Painful and difficult to treat if recurrent, long-standing and large ulcer. Other Complications: Priapism Stroke and silent infarction Gallstones/Surgery Hepatic disease Nephropathy Lung/pulmonary hypertension Retinopathy Aplastic crisis: Caused by parvovirus B19 infection Multiorgan failure IDA (Iron Deficiency Anemia) (Option A) presents with microcytic hypochromic anaemia, not sickle cells on the smear.

Causes: Associated with neoplasms (thymoma and large granular lymphocytic leukaemia) Drug exposures Autoimmune disorders Parvovirus infection Clinical features: Fatigue, weakness, pallor, frequent infections, easy bruising or bleeding, and shortness of breath due to insufficient production of red blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets. It features a marked reduction or absence of red blood cell precursors while other hematopoietic cell lines remain normal . Aplastic anaemia (Option A) is a rare condition where the bone marrow fails to produce sufficient red blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets, leading to fatigue, infections, and bleeding. It can be caused by autoimmune diseases, infections, medications, or toxins. It involves a reduction in all hematopoietic cell lines and a hypocellular marrow with increased fat content on bone marrow biopsy. Iron deficiency anaemia (Option C) is a common type of anaemia caused by insufficient iron, leading to reduced haemoglobin production. Symptoms include fatigue, pallor, and weakness. It presents with low haemoglobin, low MCH, low MCV, low MCV, and high reticulocyte count , and it often shows signs of microcytic anaemia on blood smears. Pernicious anaemia (Option D) is a type of vitamin B12 deficiency anaemia caused by impaired absorption of B12 due to a lack of intrinsic factors. It leads to symptoms like fatigue, weakness, and neurological issues. It features low haemoglobin, high MCV, high MCH, and Erythroid hyperplasia on bone marrow biopsy .

      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "inflammation and immune responses. In this scenario, the patient presents with microcytic hypochromic anemia, which is often caused by iron deficiency. Ferroportin is a protein that functions as an iron exporter, allowing iron to exit from cells into the bloodstream, where it can be utilized for various physiological processes including red blood cell production. When ferroportin is inhibited, it leads to reduced iron export from cells and contributes to iron retention within the cells.In chronic inflammatory conditions, such as the one mentioned in the question, there is an increased production of IL-6. IL-6 has been shown to stimulate the production of hepcidin, a peptide hormone synthesized in the liver. Hepcidin regulates iron homeostasis by binding to ferroportin and causing its internalization and degradation. This action reduces iron export from cells, leading to decreased iron availability for erythropoiesis (red blood cell production). Consequently, chronic inflammation-induced elevation of IL-6 and subsequent increase in hepcidin levels result in reduced iron absorption and availability for red blood cell formation, leading to microcytic hypochromic anemia. Incorrect Options: Option A - IL-1: Interleukin-1 is also involved in inflammation and immune responses, but it does not have a direct role in inhibiting ferroportin. It can contribute to inflammation-induced systemic responses. Option C - IFN-gamma: Interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) is primarily involved in immune responses and has not been directly implicated in the inhibition of ferroportin. Option D - TNF-Alpha: Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) is another cytokine involved in inflammation. It does contribute to the inflammatory response, but it is not the primary cytokine responsible for inhibiting ferroportin. Reference: .",

Low serum transferrin saturation indicates low iron stores , which is commonly seen in iron deficiency anaemia. Investigations for IDA Iron Study Interpretation in Iron Deficiency Anemia Serum Ferritin Low (< 30 ng/mL) indicates depleted iron stores. Serum Iron (Fe) Low levels are seen. Total Iron Binding Capacity (TIBC) Increased TIBC reflects the increased capacity of transferrin to bind iron in response to low iron stores.

      "explanation": "Correct Answer: D) High mechanical fragility, low osmotic fragility Explanation: Sickle cell disease (SCD) is a hemoglobinopathy characterized by the presence of abnormal haemoglobin, known as haemoglobin S (HbS). Under low oxygen conditions, HbS polymerizes, causing RBCs to assume a sickle shape. Sickle-shaped RBCs are more rigid and less deformable, leading to high mechanical fragility , making them more likely to rupture under stress. Unlike normal RBCs, sickle-shaped RBCs have low osmotic fragility , meaning they are less prone to hemolysis in hypotonic solutions.

      "correct_answer": "D",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: D) Decreased haptoglobin Explanation: Decreased haptoglobin is a hallmark of hemolytic anaemia and helps distinguish it from other types of anaemia. In hemolytic anaemia, the destruction of RBCs increases the amount of free haemoglobin in the blood, which binds to haptoglobin. Other conditions where haptoglobin is reduced are (intravascular hemolysis): Paroxysmal Nocturnal Hemoglobinuria (PNH) Microangiopathic Hemolytic Anemia (MAHA)- HUS, TTP, DIC Paroxysmal cold hemoglobinuria/Cold hemolysin type AIHA G6PD deficiency Neutropenia (Option B) refers to a low number of neutrophils, a type of white blood cell, which is not directly associated with hemolytic anaemia . Hemolytic anaemia primarily involves RBC destruction, not neutrophil abnormalities. Reticulocytopenia (Option C) : In hemolytic anaemia , the body responds to RBC destruction by producing more reticulocytes (immature red blood cells) as part of the compensatory mechanism.

      "explanation": "Correct Answer: A) Osmotic fragility test - Hereditary spherocytosis Explanation: The given clinical scenario and peripheral smear showing spherocytes most likely suggest a diagnosis of hereditary spherocytosis. The osmotic fragility test is used to diagnose hereditary spherocytosis, as spherocytes are more fragile and lyse in hypotonic solutions. Hereditary spherocytosis (HS) is an inherited disorder caused by intrinsic defects in the red cell membrane skeleton that render red cells spheroid, less deformable, and vulnerable to splenic sequestration and destruction. It has an autosomal dominant inheritance(75%) characterised by ankyrin mutation and an autosomal recessive inheritance characterised by spectrin mutation. Pathophysiology of hereditary spherocytosis: Mutations of ankyrin, band 3, spectrin, or band 4.2 ↓ Unstable RBC membrane with membrane loss ↓ The surface: volume ratio is reduced ↓ RBC takes up the shape of a sphere to compensate ↓ Spherical RBCs are trapped in splenic sinusoids due to large size ↓ Extravascular hemolysis The most specific morphologic finding is spherocytosis: Dark-staining (hyperchromic) spherocytes lacking the central zone of pallor. Other features include reticulocytosis. The characteristic clinical features are anemia, splenomegaly, jaundice, and an increased risk of gallstones. Severity ranges from asymptomatic to severe hemolytic anemia requiring transfusions. Early complications include neonatal jaundice and hemolytic crises. Late complications include gallstones and rarely iron overload.",

        "D": "Essential thrombocytosis"
      },
      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "complaints of itching during baths and laboratory findings of increased hemoglobin, decreased platelet count, and increased white blood cell count is suggestive of polycythemia vera. Polycythemia vera is a myeloproliferative neoplasm characterized by the overproduction of red blood cells. It is usually associated with an increase in hemoglobin and hematocrit. Patients with polycythemia vera may experience symptoms such as pruritus (itching), especially after a warm bath or shower, due to increased histamine release caused by increased basophils in the blood. Incorrect Options: Option A - Primary myelofibrosis: Primary myelofibrosis, also known as idiopathic myelofibrosis, is a myeloproliferative neoplasm characterized by bone marrow fibrosis, extramedullary hematopoiesis, and cytopenias. It typically presents with anemia, splenomegaly, and other constitutional symptoms. Option B - Chronic myeloid leukemia: Chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) is a myeloproliferative neoplasm characterized by the Philadelphia chromosome, resulting from the reciprocal translocation between chromosomes 9 and 22. CML typically presents with an increased white blood cell count, especially neutrophils, and splenomegaly. Option D - Essential thrombocytosis: Essential thrombocytosis, also known as primary thrombocythemia, is a myeloproliferative neoplasm characterized by the overproduction of platelets. It typically presents with an increased platelet count but does not usually cause significant changes in hemoglobin or white blood cell count. Reference: Prepladder Notes",

      "explanation": "by the breakdown of hemoglobin. It is commonly found in macrophages and can accumulate in various tissues in the body under certain conditions, such as hemorrhage, inflammation, and iron overload disorders. Perls Prussian blue stain is a commonly used stain for the detection of hemosiderin. The stain is based on the reaction of potassium ferrocyanide and hydrochloric acid with iron in hemosiderin, which produces a blue color. The staining is often performed on tissue sections from biopsy or autopsy specimens. Incorrect Options: Option A - Mason-Fontana stain: This stain is based on the oxidation of melanin by potassium permanganate, which results in the formation of brown or black pigment. The stain is commonly used for the detection of melanin pigment in tissues, such as the skin, hair, and eyes. Option B - Oil Red O: This stain is a lipophilic dye that is used to detect lipids, such as triglycerides and cholesterol esters. The dye binds to the lipid droplets in tissues, producing a bright red color. The stain is commonly used for the detection of fat in frozen sections of tissue samples. Option C - Sudan black: This stain is a lipophilic dye that is used to detect lipids in tissues. The stain binds to the lipid droplets in tissues, producing a dark blue-black color.
