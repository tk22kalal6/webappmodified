Aschoff bodies , characterized by areas of lymphocytic infiltrates, plump macrophages (Anitschkow cells) , and fibroblasts, are commonly found in all layers of the heart (maximum in myocardium) of patients with Rheumatic Heart Disease. These structures are indicative of the inflammatory response associated with acute rheumatic fever. Anitschkow cells: They display abundant cytoplasm and central round to ovoid nuclei, occasionally binucleate, with chromatin condensed into a central, thin, wavy ribbon, presenting two distinct morphological patterns as: Caterpillar chromatin pattern \"Owl eye\" appearance Anitschkow cells, also known as caterpillar cells, are plump macrophages with an elongated, wavy nucleus. They are characteristic histological features found in Aschoff bodies. These cells play a role in the inflammatory response within the myocardium during acute rheumatic fever. Fibrous thickening of the endocardium (Option A): Seen in chronic RHD , not acute RHD. Calcific nodules on valve leaflets (Option C): Occur in senile aortic stenosis (age-related degeneration). Disruption of the endothelial lining of blood vessels (Option D): Found in vasculitis (e.g., Kawasaki disease, PAN) , not RHD.

The Duke’s Criteria for diagnosing Infective Endocarditis include major criteria such as positive blood cultures for typical microorganisms persistently isolated from blood cultures (e.g., Streptococcus viridans, Staphylococcus aureus), echocardiographic evidence of endocardial involvement (vegetations or abscesses), and the presence of a new valvular regurgitation. Additionally, minor criteria include fever, predisposing cardiac conditions, vascular phenomena, immunological phenomena, and microbiological evidence not meeting major criteria.

It encodes for nuclear lamina proteins and can disrupt the structure and function of the heart, leading to the development of dilated cardiomyopathy. Truncation mutations in TTN, a gene that encodes titin (the largest protein expressed in humans), may account for approximately 10% to 20% of all cases of DCM. In the genetic forms of DCM, autosomal dominant inheritance is the predominant pattern.

      },
      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: A) Excessive release of catecholamines. Explanation : Excessive release of catecholamines is the most likely underlying mechanism for the development of Takotsubo cardiomyopathy in this patient. Emotional or physical stress, such as the news of a family member's serious illness, can trigger a surge of catecholamines (e.g., adrenaline and noradrenaline). Takotsubo cardiomyopathy is an entity characterised by left ventricular contractile dysfunction after extreme psychological stress (thus also called broken heart syndrome) Maximum catecholamine receptors are present in the left ventricle, leading to LV dilation. Affected myocardium may be stunned or show contraction band necrosis, which can eventually progress to DCM. The left ventricular apex is most often affected, leading to “apical ballooning” that resembles a takotsubo, Japanese for “fishing pot for trapping octopus”. The mechanism of catecholamine cardiotoxicity likely relates either to direct myocyte toxicity due to calcium overload or to focal vasoconstriction in the coronary arterial macro- or microcirculation in the face of an increased heart rate.

      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Correct answer: B) Beta-myosin heavy chain Explanation: Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM): It is a common (1 in 500 prevalence) clinically heterogeneous genetic disorder characterized by myocardial hypertrophy , poorly compliant left ventricular myocardium leading to abnormal diastolic filling , and (in about one-third of cases) intermittent ventricular outflow obstruction. It is the leading cause of left ventricular hypertrophy unexplained by other clinical or pathologic causes. It is a leading cause of sudden death in the young and is an important cause of heart failure. Causes: HCM is most commonly caused by mutations in any one of several genes that encode sarcomeric proteins. There are more than 400 different known mutations in nine different genes, most being missense mutations. Mutations causing HCM are found most commonly in the genes encoding myosin-binding protein C (MYBP-C) or β -myosin heavy chain ( β -MHC/MYH7) , followed by the genes coding for cardiac TnI, TnT (Option C), and α -tropomyosin (Option D) ; overall, these account for 70% to 80% of all cases.

Endomyocardial fibrosis: It is principally a disease of children and young adults in Africa and other tropical areas. It is characterized by fibrosis of the ventricular endocardium and subendocardium that extends from the apex upward , often eventually involving the tricuspid and mitral valves. The fibrous tissue markedly diminishes the volume and compliance of affected chambers, causing a restrictive functional defect. Ventricular mural thrombi sometimes develop, and indeed much of the endocardial fibrosis may result from thrombus organization. Endomyocardial fibrosis is linked to nutritional deficiencies and/or inflammation related to parasitic infections (e.g., hypereosinophilia).
