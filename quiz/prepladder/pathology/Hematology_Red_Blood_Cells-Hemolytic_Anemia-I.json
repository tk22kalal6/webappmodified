Intravascular hemolysis is caused by mechanical injury, complement fixation, intracellular parasites, or exogenous toxins. Extravascular hemolysis is due to changes that make red cells less deformable. This makes their passage difficult, leading to red cell sequestration and phagocytosis by macrophages located within the splenic cords. Splenomegaly and jaundice are prominent features. Intravascular hemolysis Extravascular hemolysis Hemolysis occurs inside a vessel Hepatomegaly or splenomegaly are usually absent Serum haptoglobin is reduced Hemoglobinuria and hemosiderinuria are seen Hemolysis occurs outside a vessel.

      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: A) Hereditary spherocytosis Explanation: The given clinical scenario and peripheral smear showing spherocytes most likely suggest a diagnosis of hereditary spherocytosis. Hereditary spherocytosis (HS) is an inherited disorder caused by intrinsic defects in the red cell membrane skeleton that render red cells spheroid, less deformable, and vulnerable to splenic sequestration and destruction. It has an autosomal dominant inheritance(75%) characterized by ankyrin mutation and an autosomal recessive inheritance characterized by spectrin mutation. Pathophysiology of hereditary spherocytosis: The most specific morphologic finding is spherocytosis: Dark-staining (hyperchromic) spherocytes lacking the central zone of pallor. Other features include reticulocytosis. The characteristic clinical features are anemia, splenomegaly, jaundice, and an increased risk of gallstones. Severity ranges from asymptomatic to severe hemolytic anemia requiring transfusions. Early complications include neonatal jaundice and hemolytic crises. Late complications include gallstones and rarely iron overload. Autoimmune hemolytic anemia (AIHA) (Option B): AIHA involves antibodies targeting red blood cells and typically has a positive Coombs test, which is not mentioned. It usually presents with acute rather than recurrent hemolysis. Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency (Option C): It is characterized by bite cells, not hyperchromic spherocytes lacking a central pallor. Thalassemia (Option D): It is characterized by target cells rather than sperocytes on peripheral smear.",

      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: C) RDW decreases Explanation: The RDW (red cell distribution width) increases, not decreases, in hereditary spherocytosis due to anisocytosis- a heterogeneous population of red blood cells, including both normal-sized and smaller, denser spherocytes. The MCV decreases due to the presence of smaller, more dense red blood cells (spherocytes). (Option A) The MCHC increases due to dehydration of RBCs, leading to a higher concentration of hemoglobin per unit volume of the cell. (Option B) Hemoglobin levels may decrease in hereditary spherocytosis due to the hemolysis, but they do not increase.

Osmotic Fragility Test : Assesses RBC susceptibility to hemolysis in hypotonic saline. Used for screening HS and thalassemia. RBCs are incubated in hypotonic saline of varying osmolarities. Measures hemolysis as saline enters RBCs, causing swelling and lysis. Normal RBC Response : It begins to lyse around 0.5% NaCl concentration. (Option D) Maintain shape due to balance between membrane integrity and osmotic pressure. Hereditary Spherocytosis (HS) : RBCs are more fragile due to reduced surface-to-volume ratio. The osmotic fragility curve shifts to the right. More susceptible to hemolysis at higher saline concentrations. Thalassemia : Characterized by smaller and more rigid RBCs. The osmotic fragility curve shifts to the left. (Option B) Lyses at lower saline concentrations compared to normal RBCs. However, this test is just a screening method, and the Eosin-5-maleimide (EMA) binding test is the gold standard for diagnosing hereditary spherocytosis.

      "explanation": "Correct Answer: A) Deficiency in an enzyme leads to oxidative stress-induced hemolysis. oxidative stress-induced hemolysis Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency is an X-linked recessive disorder characterised by a deficiency in the G6PD enzyme, which protects red blood cells from oxidative damage. This reduces the ability to generate NADPH via the pentose phosphate pathway and impairs glutathione regeneration, exacerbating oxidative stress and hemolysis. (Option B) When exposed to oxidative stressors, there is an imbalance between the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and antioxidants that neutralize them. This leads to oxidative damage to red blood cell membranes and proteins, resulting in hemolysis. (Option C) It presents with episodes of acute hemolytic anemia triggered by oxidative stressors such as infections, certain medications (e.g., antimalarials, sulfonamides), or ingestion of certain foods (e.g., fava beans). (Option D) Clinical manifestations include fatigue, pallor, jaundice, and dark urine (due to hemoglobinuria). The severity of hemolysis varies depending on the degree of enzyme deficiency and the magnitude of the oxidative insult, with some individuals experiencing life-threatening hemolytic crises.

      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "haemoglobin. Correct Answer: B) It evaluates the ability of red blood cells to reduce methemoglobin back to hemoglobin. Explanation: Purpose of Methemoglobin Reduction Test : Used to detect glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency. Measures the ability of red blood cells to convert methemoglobin back to hemoglobin. Helps assess the enzymatic activity crucial for protecting cells from oxidative stress. Mechanism in G6PD Deficiency : Individuals with G6PD deficiency have reduced enzyme activity. Red blood cells are more vulnerable to oxidative damage. Impaired reduction of methemoglobin indicates decreased G6PD function. Testing Procedure : The blood sample is exposed to a chemical that induces methemoglobin formation. The rate of reduction back to hemoglobin is measured. The slower reduction compared to normal suggests G6PD deficiency. Clinical Application : Used to confirm diagnosis in patients suspected of having G6PD deficiency. Helps guide management decisions in conditions where oxidative stress can trigger hemolysis. Provides insight into the enzymatic function critical for maintaining red blood cell integrity. Other tests used for screening include: Fluorescent Spot Test (FST): This is a quick screening test that detects G6PD activity by measuring the rate of reduction of a fluorescent dye. (Option C) NADPH is autofluorescent In normal cases: fluorescence is seen. In G6PD deficiency: Fluorescence not seen Quantitative Enzyme Assays: These tests measure the actual activity levels of G6PD enzyme in the blood.

      "explanation": "Correct Answer: D) Acquired intracorpuscular defect. Explanation: The true statement regarding PNH is that it is an acquired intracorpuscular defect. PNH is the \"ONLY\" acquired intracorpuscular defect (defect within the RBCs) among hemolytic anemia, making them susceptible to destruction by the complement system. It causes intravascular hemolysis due to complement activation that attacks RBCs. (Option A) Hence, splenectomy, which would be beneficial in some cases of extravascular hemolysis, would not be of any use in PNH. (Option B) Contrary to the name, only 25% of cases show paroxysmal and nocturnal hemolysis. (Option C) Red cell lysis at night is explained by a slight decrease in blood pH during sleep, which increases complement activation.

      "correct_answer": "D",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: D) PIGA gene Explanation: Paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria is due to a mutation in the PIGA gene. Pathogenesis of PNH: PNH is caused by an acquired mutation in the PIGA gene leading to defective synthesis of (GPI) anchors. GPI anchors are essential for attaching certain proteins to the cell surface, including CD55 (decay-accelerating factor), CD59 (membrane inhibitor of reactive lysis), and C8-binding protein. (Option B) These proteins regulate the complement system and inhibit the formation of the membrane attack complex (MAC) that leads to cell lysis. In PNH, the deficiency of these regulators increases susceptibility to complement-mediated hemolysis. Subsequent lysis by the MAC leads to intravascular hemolysis Hemoglobin from lysed RBCs appears in the urine (hemoglobinuria) and is more pronounced during periods of increased complement activation, such as at night ( Nocturnal ) or stress.
