      },
      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "′ Diaminobenzidine(DAB) is a chromogen used in histochemical and IHC staining. In IHC, DAB is a substrate for a peroxidase enzyme coupled to a primary or secondary antibody. It is oxidised and converted to an insoluble polymer, precipitating as a dark brown pigment, which allows visualisation of the target molecule. Congo red can stain amyloid fibres in red and orange. When viewed under polarised light in a microscope, Congo-red-stained tissues high in amyloid will show bright apple-green birefringence (Option 2). Masson's Trichrome stains collagen fibres blue. It can identify cardiac fibrosis, pulmonary fibrosis, and chronic kidney disease (Option 3). Mucicarmine stains mucin, a secretion produced in epithelial and connective tissue and capsule of Cryptococcus (Option 4).

      "explanation": "Biochemical assays targeting tumour-associated enzymes, hormones, and other markers in the bloodstream often lack the sensitivity and specificity to diagnose cancer definitively. However, when used alongside other diagnostic tests, they can aid in identifying cancer. Additionally, these assays prove valuable in monitoring a tumour's response to treatment and detecting tumour recurrence.

Successful resection of the underlying tumour results in markers such as CEA disappearing from the serum.

      "explanation": "FNAC procedures is the 25-27-gauge needle. This ensures effective sample retrieval while minimising patient discomfort and mitigating tissue trauma. FNAC: FNAC is a minimally invasive technique for procuring cells from suspicious lesions or masses for cytological examination. It utilises a slender needle gauge to extract cells from the target site. In the FNAC procedure, the lesion of interest is first identified via imaging modalities such as ultrasound, CT scan, or MRI. A needle is then inserted into the lesion, and gentle suction is applied to draw cells into a syringe. Multiple passes may be made to ensure a sufficient sample volume. The material is either smeared onto glass slides or preserved in a fixative solution for subsequent cytological analysis. Reference: Robbins pathology, 10th edition, Pg 331.

The appropriate test to diagnose this is parathyroid hormone-related protein (PTHRP). Paraneoplastic syndrome: The paraneoplastic syndrome refers to signs and symptoms that cannot be explained by the tumour's anatomic distribution or hormones indigenous to the tumour tissue. These occur in about 10% of patients with cancer It may be the earliest manifestation of an occult neoplasm. It may mimic metastatic disease and confound treatment. PTHRP leads to hypercalcemia, which can present as Nausea, vomiting, Abdominal pain( groans) , Bone pain( bones) , Renal stones( stones) , Fatigue malaise (moans) , Polyuria, polydipsia, Constipation( thrones) , Lethargy, confusion, depression, Memory loss ( psychic overtones ).

It is commonly caused by neuroendocrine tumours of the midgut that metastasise to the liver. It is also seen with ovarian tumours or bronchial carcinoids. They secrete mediators like serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine), kallikrein, bradykinin, histamine, and prostaglandins. These mediators are usually metabolised by the liver, so patients are initially asymptomatic.
