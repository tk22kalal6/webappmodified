      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: C) Lacks malignant potential Explanation : The characteristic of hyperplastic polyps is that they lack malignant potential. Hyperplastic polyps: Lacks malignant potential Benign epithelial proliferations occurring commonly in the 6th-7th decade. Formed due to decreased epithelial cell turnover and delayed shedding, resulting in a piling up of goblet and absorptive cells. (Option B) Usually less than 5 mm with a smooth, nodular appearance and commonly found in the left colon. (Option A) Mature goblet cells and absorptive cells with serrated surface architecture are hallmark findings.

      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: B) Size of the adenoma Explanation: The size of colorectal adenomas is the most critical factor associated with the risk of malignancy. Larger adenomas are most likely to develop into invasive carcinoma Adenomas larger than 4 cm in diameter have nearly a 40% chance of containing invasive cancer. Villous architecture (Option A) : Villous adenomas are associated with a higher incidence of cancer than tubular adenomas, but this correlation primarily arises from their larger size rather than their architectural characteristics alone. Histologic grade of dysplasia (Option C) : High-grade dysplasia within an individual polyp increases its risk of harboring cancer. However, histologic grade of dysplasia is not the primary factor correlating with the overall risk of malignancy across adenomas. Gastrointestinal tract location (Option D) : While certain types of polyps may have preferences for specific locations within the gastrointestinal tract (e.g., sessile serrated lesions are more common in the right colon), location alone is not the strongest predictor of malignancy in colorectal adenomas.
