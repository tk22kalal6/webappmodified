      "question": "B-cells are induced to produce IgE by which of the following?",
      "options": {
        "A": "IL-2",
        "B": "IL-4",
        "C": "IL-1",
        "D": "IL-6"
      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: B) IL-4 Explanation: IL-4 plays a crucial role in the activation of B-cells to produce immunoglobulin E (IgE). It is a cytokine primarily produced by Th2 helper cells, mast cells, and basophils. IL-4 stimulates B-cells to undergo class switching to IgE, which is an important mediator in allergic reactions and responses to parasitic infections. Interleukins in Type-1 hypersensitivity reaction: Interleukins Role IL-4 Key cytokine in driving the allergic response Enhances Ig E-mediated reaction Stimulates B cells to undergo class switching to IgE and promotes the expansion of Th2 cells IL-5 Development and activation of eosinophils → Recruited to the site of allergen exposure → Release inflammatory mediators and enzymes → Tissue damage and inflammation IL-13 Amplifies IgE production Acts on epithelial cells to stimulate mucus secretion IL-10 Anti-inflammatory cytokine Inhibits cytokine production by Th1 cells and macrophages. IL-2 (Option A) is primarily involved in the growth and proliferation of T-cells, especially CD4+ and CD8+ T-cells, and does not induce IgE production. IL-1 (Option C) is a pro-inflammatory cytokine that promotes fever and immune responses, but it does not directly induce IgE production. IL-6 (Option D) is involved in the acute-phase response and the differentiation of B-cells into plasma cells, but it is not specifically involved in inducing IgE production.

      "question": "A Rh-negative mother delivered an Rh-positive baby, and Coomb’s test was positive for the baby. What is the mechanism of hypersensitivity seen in this scenario?",
      "options": {
        "A": "Antigen-dependent cellular cytotoxicity",

      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: B) Antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity Explanation: This scenario involves Type II hypersensitivity, where the Rh-negative mother’s immune system produces IgG antibodies against her fetus's Rh-positive red blood cells. These antibodies cross the placenta and bind to the fetal red blood cells, initiating their destruction by activating immune cells through antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC). This leads to hemolytic disease in the newborn and results in a positive Coomb's test, which detects antibodies bound to the fetal red blood cells. Mechanisms of Type II hypersensitivity Description Examples Opsonisation and Phagocytosis IgG antibodies coat cells, helping phagocytes recognise circulating antigen-opsonin complexes through Fc receptors or complement activation, leading to phagocytosis. Autoimmune hemolytic anemia Immune thrombocytopenic purpura Rh hemolytic disease of the newborn . Complement activation and inflammation Antibody deposition in extracellular tissues triggers inflammation rather than phagocytosis or cell lysis. The deposited antibodies activate the complement system, attracting neutrophils and monocytes via their Fc receptors. Activated leukocytes release enzymes, causing tissue damage. Goodpasture syndrome. Acute rheumatic fever. Antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) Natural killer cells bind to antibody-antigen complexes, inducing apoptotic cell death. Pernicious anemia Insulin resistant diabetes Antibody-mediated cellular dysfunction (non-cytotoxic) Antibodies physically impair or dysregulate cellular function by binding to cell surface receptors. This includes both activation (e.g., thyroid hormone receptor in Graves disease) and inhibition (e.g., acetylcholine receptor in Myasthenia gravis). Graves disease Myasthenia gravis Note: Myasthenia gravis and Graves disease are now classified as Type V hypersensitivity (Type V > Type II) Type V hypersensitivity reaction: Antibodies against cellular receptors.

      "question": "Which of the following conditions is associated with hypocalcemia, thymic hypoplasia, cardiac abnormalities, and deletion of chromosome 22q11.2?",
      "options": {
        "A": "Williams syndrome",
        "B": "Pitt syndrome",
        "C": "DiGeorge syndrome",
        "D": "Cri-du-chat syndrome"
      },
      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: C) DiGeorge syndrome Explanation: DiGeorge syndrome (22q11.2 deletion syndrome) is caused by a deletion on the long arm of chromosome 22. It is characterised by hypocalcemia, thymic hypoplasia, and cardiac abnormalities and occurs in 1 in 4000 births. The condition is often overlooked due to its variable clinical features. These features include: Congenital heart defects Abnormalities of the palate Facial dysmorphism Developmental delay T-cell immunodeficiency Hypocalcemia Key features: Thymic hypoplasia leading to T-cell immunodeficiency Parathyroid hypoplasia causing hypocalcemia Cardiac malformations affecting the outflow tract Facial anomalies (e.g., mild facial dysmorphology) Diagnosis: The condition is suspected clinically but confirmed by FISH (Fluorescence in situ hybridisation) testing. Around 90% of DiGeorge syndrome and 80% of velocardiofacial syndrome cases show the 22q11.2 deletion. This test can also identify deletions in individuals with conotruncal cardiac defects but no other features of the syndrome. Williams Syndrome (Option A) is a genetic disorder caused by a deletion on chromosome 7 , not 22q11.2. It is characterised by cardiovascular problems, developmental delays, and distinctive facial features, but it does not involve thymic hypoplasia, cardiac abnormalities like those seen in DiGeorge syndrome, or hypocalcemia. Pitt Syndrome (Option B) is a rare genetic condition linked to mutations in the FLNA gene, leading to developmental and cardiac abnormalities. It doesn’t involve the same chromosome 22q11.2 deletion or the associated features of thymic hypoplasia, immunodeficiency, or hypocalcemia seen in DiGeorge syndrome. Cri-du-chat Syndrome (Option D) is caused by a deletion on the short arm of chromosome 5. The main features include a distinctive high-pitched cry, intellectual disability, and certain facial features, but it does not include the hallmark features of DiGeorge syndrome, such as thymic hypoplasia, cardiac defects, and hypocalcemia.",

        "C": "Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE)",
        "D": "Rheumatoid arthritis"
      },
      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: C) Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) Explanation: The most likely diagnosis is Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE) , an autoimmune disorder that commonly affects young women and presents with features such as: Malar rash (butterfly-shaped rash over the cheeks and nose), Recurrent oral ulcers , Joint pain (often non-erosive arthritis), Thrombocytopenia , Positive anti-Smith (anti-Sm) antibodies , which are highly specific for SLE. While scleroderma , Sjögren syndrome , and rheumatoid arthritis share overlapping symptoms, the positive anti-Sm antibody is most specific to SLE, confirming the diagnosis. SLE is a chronic autoimmune disease with the production of many antibodies like antinuclear antibodies (ANAs), anti-double-stranded DNA (dsDNA), and anti-Smith (Sm). These autoantibodies form immune complexes that deposit in tissues, causing inflammation and damage. It is more common in women. Clinical Manifestations of SLE: Skin: Malar rash (butterfly rash), photosensitivity, discoid lesions, and mucosal ulcers. Joints: Non-erosive arthritis commonly affects the hands, wrists, and knees. Renal: Lupus nephritis ranging from asymptomatic proteinuria to severe kidney failure. The major cause of morbidity and mortality in SLE. Cardiovascular: Pericarditis, myocarditis, increased risk of atherosclerosis and coronary artery disease. Pulmonary: Pleurisy and pleural effusion, pulmonary hypertension and interstitial lung. Neurologic: Neuropsychiatric symptoms ranging from headaches and cognitive dysfunction to seizures and psychosis. Hematologic: Anemia, leukopenia, and thrombocytopenia. The risk of thrombotic events is increased. Marker/Antibody Clinical Significance Anti-Smith (anti-Sm) antibodies Highly specific for SLE (<30% of patients) Anti-dsDNA antibodies Highly specific for SLE (60-70% of patients); correlates with the disease Antinuclear antibodies (ANA) Highly sensitive but not specific for SLE Anti-Ro (SSA) and Anti-La (SSB) antibodies Found in SLE and Sjögren syndrome; associated with neonatal lupus Anti-ribosomal-P antibodies Specific for neuropsychiatric manifestations in SLE Anti-histone antibodies Seen in drug-induced lupus; less specific for SLE Complements C3 and C4 Low levels indicate complement consumption and disease activity Reference: Robbins & Cotran Pathologic Basis of Disease, 10th Edition, Page 222, 230-236",

        "D": "Dystrophic calcification"
      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: B) Cardiac amyloidosis Explanation: The hallmark feature is apple-green birefringence under polarised light after Congo red staining, characteristic of amyloid deposits. Cardiac amyloidosis causes restrictive cardiomyopathy, presenting with symptoms like fatigue, breathlessness, and oedema. Congo red stain identifies amyloid fibrils in tissue. Amyloidosis is abnormal extracellular deposits of fibrillar proteins that cause tissue damage and functional compromise. These proteins are misfolded and aggregate, forming amyloid deposits. Amyloid deposits appear as eosinophilic, hyaline, and extracellular substances on hematoxylin and eosin stains. They are confirmed by Congo red staining, which shows red under ordinary light and apple-green birefringence under polarised light. Morphology: Amyloid deposition is often widespread, but organ involvement can vary: Kidney: Most commonly and severely affected, with amyloid deposits in the glomeruli, arteries, and arterioles. Spleen: Enlarged, showing two patterns of amyloid deposits: \"sago spleen\" (follicular) and \"lardaceous spleen\" (sinusoidal). Liver: Amyloid deposits in the space of Disse; liver function is generally preserved despite enlargement. Heart: Commonly involved in senile systemic amyloidosis, with deposits starting subendocardially and in the myocardium. Other organs: May include the tongue (macroglossia), lungs (respiratory tract involvement), and brain (Alzheimer's plaques).

        "C": "IgM",
        "D": "IgG"
      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: B) IgE Explanation: The clinical features of facial swelling, itching, and hypotension following a bee sting are due to an Allergic Reaction (Type 1 Hypersensitivity Reaction) mediated by the immune system, particularly through IgE (Immunoglobulin E) antibodies. IgE plays a key role in allergic responses by binding to receptors on mast cells and basophils after exposure to an allergen, like bee venom. Upon re-exposure to the allergen, it binds to IgE on mast cells and basophils, triggering the release of histamine, leukotrienes, and prostaglandins, which cause the symptoms. Symptoms: Characteristic symptoms of an allergic reaction are: Facial swelling (angioedema) Itching, and Hypotension. Histamine causes blood vessel dilation and increased permeability, leading to facial swelling and itching. In severe cases, it can induce hypotension and trigger anaphylaxis. IgA (Option A) is primarily involved in mucosal immunity, protecting the mucous membranes of the respiratory, digestive, and genitourinary tracts. It is not typically associated with immediate hypersensitivity reactions like those seen in response to bee stings. IgM (Option C) is the first antibody produced during an immune response. It is involved in the primary immune response and is not specifically associated with allergic reactions or the symptoms described in the scenario. IgG (Option D) is the most abundant antibody in the bloodstream and is involved in long-term immunity. While IgG can play a role in some types of allergic reactions, it is not the primary immunoglobulin responsible for the immediate hypersensitivity reactions seen in response to a bee sting.",

      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: B) Activated B cells Explanation: Isotype switching , also known as class switching, occurs in activated B cells . This process allows B cells to produce different classes of antibodies (e.g., IgM, IgG, IgA, IgE) in response to specific signals, such as cytokines from helper T cells, during an immune response. Isotype switching , also referred to as class switching or immunoglobulin class switch recombination (CSR), is a process that takes place in activated B cells. During this process, B cells change the class of antibodies they produce, transitioning from IgM to other isotypes such as IgG, IgA, or IgE. Isotype switching enables B cells to generate antibodies with diverse effector functions while preserving the antigen-binding specificity of the original antibody. IL-4 Key cytokine in driving the allergic response Enhances Ig E-mediated reaction Stimulates B cells to undergo class switching to IgE and promotes the expansion of Th2 cells Defect in class switching - Hyper IgM Syndrome, caused by defects in CD40L (X-linked) or CD40/AID/UNG (autosomal recessive), leads to high IgM with low IgG, IgA, and IgE, causing recurrent infections.

      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: A) Helper T cells Explanation: Contact dermatitis is an inflammatory skin condition that occurs when the skin comes into contact with an allergen or irritant. The pathogenesis involves a complex interplay between various immune cells, including antigen-presenting cells (such as dendritic cells), T cells (including helper T cells ), and other immune mediators. Helper T cells are activated upon recognition of the allergen, and they release cytokines that recruit and activate other immune cells, leading to the characteristic inflammation and skin reactions seen in contact dermatitis. The type of hypersensitivity involved in contact dermatitis is Type IV . Mechanisms of Type IV hypersensitivity Description Examples Cytokine-mediated inflammation (mediated by CD4+ T cells) CD4+ T cells recognise protein antigens presented by APCs and differentiate into Th1 and Th17 cells . Th1 cells secrete cytokines like IFN- γ , activating macrophages to cause tissue damage and fibrosis. Th17 cells produce IL-17 to recruit neutrophils, promoting inflammation. Tuberculin test (a classic example of delayed-type hypersensitivity) Granulomas Contact dermatitis Rheumatoid arthritis Multiple sclerosis IBD Psoriasis T cell-mediated cytotoxicity (mediated by CD8+ T cells) Cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) directly kill antigen-bearing target cells, including tumour cells, virus-infected cells, and allogeneic tissue, during graft rejection. CTLs use perforin-granzyme-dependent killing and Fas-Fas ligand-dependent killing mechanisms to induce apoptosis in target cells. Type 1 DM Hepatic injury in HBV infection Graft vs host disease Helper T cells play a crucial role in the immune response by coordinating and regulating other immune cells. They release cytokines that activate and recruit other cells to the site of inflammation, including in the case of contact dermatitis. Neutrophils (Option B) are typically involved in acute inflammation and play a major role in fighting bacterial infections. While neutrophils may be recruited to the site of inflammation in some cases of contact dermatitis, they are not the primary cells involved in the pathogenesis of the condition. NK cells (Option C) are a type of cytotoxic lymphocyte that plays a role in the innate immune response. They are primarily involved in recognising and eliminating virally infected and tumour cells. NK cells are not typically the primary cells involved in contact dermatitis. Cytotoxic T cells (Option B) are a type of T lymphocyte that directly kills infected or abnormal cells. They play a critical role in the immune response against viruses and tumour cells. While they may be involved in certain immune responses, they are not the primary cells in contact dermatitis.",

It is characterized by abnormal lymph node architecture and an increased number of blood vessels within the affected lymph nodes. The histopathology image of the resected lymph node is not provided, so we cannot directly confirm the presence of these features. However, based on the information given (abdominal distention, intermittent fever, and a resected lymph node), Castleman disease is a reasonable differential diagnosis. Incorrect Option Option A . Angiolymphoma: Angiolymphoma, also known as epithelioid hemangioma, is a rare vascular tumor that can occur in the skin, soft tissues, and other organs. It typically presents as a solitary skin lesion rather than a lymph node involvement. Therefore, it is less likely to be the correct diagnosis in this case. Option B . Hodgkin's lymphoma: Hodgkin's lymphoma is a type of lymphoma characterized by the presence of Reed-Sternberg cells, which are large abnormal cells found in the lymph nodes. The peripheral smear findings in this patient are reported as normal, which is not consistent with Hodgkin's lymphoma. Additionally, the histopathology image of the resected lymph node is not provided, so it is difficult to evaluate the presence of Reed-Sternberg cells. Option C . IgG-4 related disease: IgG4-related disease is a relatively newly recognized fibroinflammatory condition that can affect various organs, including the lymph nodes. It is characterized by lymphoplasmacytic infiltration and fibrosis. However, without the histopathology image, it is challenging to determine if the lymph node in question shows the typical histological features associated with IgG4-related disease. Additionally, the clinical presentation of abdominal distention and intermittent fever is not specific to IgG4-related disease. Reference: .",

Lymphoid Organs are structures involved in the production, maturation, and storage of immune cells, essential for the immune system to detect and respond to pathogens. They are classified as: Primary lymphoid organ (Development and maturation of T and B lymphocytes) Secondary lymphoid organ (Site of adaptive immune responses to antigens) Primary Lymphoid Organs Secondary Lymphoid Organs Bone Marrow: Origin of all blood cells from pluripotent hematopoietic stem cells (a process called hematopoiesis). Hematopoiesis shifts to bone marrow from the liver after fetal life, eventually confined to axial bones after puberty. Progenitor T and B cells develop in bone marrow; B cells mature here, while T cell progenitors migrate to the thymus. Lymph Nodes: (Option A ruled out) Filter antigens and activate T and B cells. Structured into cortex (B cell area), paracortex (T cell area), and medulla (rich in plasma cells). Spleen: (Option B ruled out) Largest secondary lymphoid organ, involved in filtering blood-borne antigens. Contains white pulp (T and B cells) and red pulp (site of RBC destruction). Thymus: (Option C) Site of T cell proliferation and maturation. Developed from the third/fourth pharyngeal pouch in embryonic life. Active during childhood, decreases in size after puberty. Thymic hormones (e.g., thymulin, thymopoietin) help attract and mature T cells. Central tolerance occurs here, removing self-reactive T cells to prevent autoimmunity. Mucosa-associated Lymphoid Tissue (MALT): (Option D ruled out) Located in mucosal sites (intestine, respiratory, urogenital tracts) to protect against pathogens. Includes loose clusters of lymphoid cells and organised structures (e.g., tonsils, Peyer’s patches in intestines).",

      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: A) CGD Explanation: The history of recurrent bacterial and fungal infections, especially affecting the skin and respiratory tract, along with multiple abscesses, lymphadenitis, and an abnormal Dihydrorhodamine (DHR) test result, strongly suggests Chronic Granulomatous Disease (CGD). It is characterised by increased susceptibility to recurrent infections caused by catalase-positive organisms. Cause : Defect in NADPH oxidase, an enzyme complex in phagocytes. Mechanism : A defect in NADPH oxidase leads to the inability to produce the reactive oxygen species (ROS) required to kill certain bacteria and fungi. Clinical Presentation : Recurrent infections, particularly with catalase-positive organisms (e.g., Staphylococcus aureus, Aspergillus), granuloma formation. This defect is identified by the abnormal DHR test, which measures the production of ROS in neutrophils. SCID (Severe Combined Immunodeficiency) (Option B) is a genetic disorder affecting both humoral and cell-mediated immunity, presenting with thrush, diaper rash, and failure to thrive in infants. It involves defects in T and B cells, leading to severe, broad immune deficiencies, unlike the phagocyte-specific defect seen in CGD. Sialyl Lewis X (Option C) is a carbohydrate on leukocytes that helps with adhesion and migration during immune responses. Its deficiency impairs neutrophil trafficking, leading to immune deficiency and recurrent infections, but does not typically cause abnormalities in the DHR test. LAD (Leukocyte Adhesion Deficiency) (Option D) is a genetic disorder causing defective neutrophil adhesion, impairing migration to infection sites, leading to recurrent infections, poor wound healing, and delayed umbilical cord separation. The DHR test is normal in LAD, as it assesses phagocyte function, not adhesion. Reference: Robbins and Cotran Pathologic Basis of Disease, 10th Edition, Page 241.",

      "explanation": "Correct Answer: A) AIRE Explanation: AIRE (autoimmune regulator) is a gene responsible for regulating T cell selection in the thymus. During negative selection, T cells that recognize self-antigens are eliminated through apoptosis. AIRE plays a crucial role in this process by promoting the deletion of self-reactive T cells. A defect in AIRE results in autoimmune polyendocrine syndrome (APS). Notch 1 (Option B) is involved in the initial development of T cells , including determining whether a progenitor cell will become a T cell, but it does not regulate the elimination of self-reactive T cells , which is the role of AIRE . E2A (Option C) is a transcription factor more relevant to B cell development and not directly related to T cell selection in the thymus. Rag1/2 (Option D) are enzymes responsible for the rearrangement of T cell receptor (TCR) genes during T cell development, but they do not directly regulate negative selection.

CD40 is a crucial co-stimulatory molecule involved in the activation and regulation of the immune response, particularly between T cells and B cells CD40L (also known as CD154) on antigen-activated CD4+ helper T cells binds to CD40 on B cells, macrophages, and dendritic cells (DCs). In the absence of CD40 , B cells cannot receive the necessary co-stimulatory signals required for proper activation and class switching. It results in a lack of IgG production (Option D ruled out) despite the presence of IgM . It leads to a condition known as Hyper-IgM syndrome . T cell absent (Option B) : CD40 deficiency does not lead to an absence of T cells . T cells are present, but the CD40 deficiency impairs the interaction between T cells and B cells . IgM increase (Option C) : Although IgM levels may be elevated in some cases due to lack of class switching, the key feature is failure to produce IgG and other antibody isotypes, leading to impaired immunity.

      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: B) Alternate RNA splicing Explanation: B cells express both IgM and IgD antibodies simultaneously due to alternative RNA splicing . This mechanism allows the same heavy chain gene to be spliced in different ways, resulting in the production of both IgM and IgD isotypes. Although IgM and IgD are derived from the same heavy chain gene, the splicing process generates distinct versions of the RNA transcript, one for IgM and one for IgD. Both antibodies share the same antigen-binding specificity but differ in their constant regions , which determine their respective isotypes. Allelic exclusion (Option A) ensures that only one allele of the immunoglobulin gene is expressed in a B cell at a time, maintaining clonal specificity, but it does not account for the co-expression of IgM and IgD. Somatic hypermutation (Option C) takes place after antigen exposure and enhances the affinity of antibodies, but it does not play a role in the simultaneous expression of IgM and IgD. Affinity maturation (Option D) is a process that improves antibody affinity during the immune response, but it does not generate multiple antibody classes concurrently.

      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: C) Autoimmunity Explanation: Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a chronic autoimmune disorder where the immune system mistakenly attacks healthy tissues. The pathogenesis of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) begins with antigenic exposure in genetically predisposed individuals, leading to the activation of CD4+ T-cells . These T-cells release inflammatory cytokines such as TNF- α , IL-1 , IL-6 , and interferon- γ , which activate endothelial cells , B lymphocytes , and macrophages . This cascade of immune activation leads to chronic inflammation , joint damage , and deformities that characterise RA. Rheumatoid arthritis Epidemiology Male to female ratio - 1:3. Peaks between 25 and 55 years. Remains constant between 55 and 75. Genetics Strongly associated with the HLA-DR β 1 gene. Higher concordance in monozygotic twins. Triggers and suppressors Cigarette smoking and infections can trigger RA in genetically predisposed individuals by citrullination of proteins. RA may remit during pregnancy and can first appear postpartum due to immune suppression and hormonal changes. Pathogenesis Incorrect Options: IgE-mediated (Option A) immune response is primarily seen in allergic reactions, not in rheumatoid arthritis. Defective cellular and humoral immunity (Option B) : While immune dysfunction plays a role in RA, the specific issue is not a general defect in immunity but rather an autoimmune response where the immune system attacks its own tissues. Chronic microbial infections (Option D) can trigger or exacerbate autoimmune diseases , but they are not the direct cause of RA. However, certain infections may contribute to disease flares or trigger the initial immune response. Reference: Harrison’s Principles of Internal Medicine, 21st Edition, Pages 2751, 2754",

Type I hypersensitivity reactions involve an immediate (early) and a late-phase reaction. Early phase reaction Late phase reaction Onset Immediate (within minutes of allergen exposure). Delayed (several hours after exposure) and can last for days. Cells involved Mast cells, basophils. Eosinophils, T lymphocytes. Cellular events Activation of mast cells and basophils. Recruitment and activation of leukocytes, especially eosinophils. Mediators Histamine , leukotrienes (LTB4, LTC4, LTD4), prostaglandins (PGD2) and Platelet-activating factor (PAF). Cytokines (e.g., IL-4, IL-5, TNF), chemokines (e.g., eotaxin). Initiating event Exposure to allergen triggers cross-linking of IgE on mast cells/basophils. Recurrent inflammation, sustained by recruited leukocytes. Effect on tissues Vasodilation, increased vascular permeability, smooth muscle contraction. Sustained inflammation and tissue damage due to leukocyte infiltration. Clinical manifestations Allergic rhinitis (hay fever), urticaria (hives), Angioedema bronchoconstriction. Allergic asthma exacerbation, persistent inflammation, and tissue damage. Therapeutic Approach Antihistamines for symptomatic relief. Adrenaline in anaphylactic shock. Broad-spectrum anti-inflammatory drugs (e.g., steroids) to suppress inflammation and prevent tissue damage. IgA (Option A) primarily involves mucosal immunity and protects against pathogens at mucosal surfaces (e.g., in the respiratory and gastrointestinal tracts), not in allergic reactions. IgM (Option C) is the first antibody produced in response to infection but is not involved in allergic reactions like those caused by bee stings.

WASP belongs to a family of proteins that are believed to link membrane receptors, such as antigen receptors, to cytoskeletal elements. IgM levels in the serum are low , but levels of IgG are usually normal. Paradoxically, the levels of IgA and IgE are often elevated . Patients are also prone to developing B-cell lymphomas. WASP may be involved in cytoskeleton-dependent responses, including cell migration and signal transduction. It may lead to early death. The only treatment is hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) transplantation . Anti-platelet antibodies (Option B) are typically found in conditions like immune thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP), but the patient's history and presentation point more toward WAS. Bone marrow biopsy (Option C) is generally used to assess hematologic disorders like leukaemia or myelodysplastic syndromes, which do not match this case. Electron microscopy (Option D) is helpful for diagnosing certain intracellular abnormalities, but it's not the first diagnostic test for WAS.

      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Correct answer: C) MHC Class II deficiency in lymphocytes Explanation: Bare Lymphocyte Syndrome (BLS) caused by MHC Class II deficiency (most common form) prevents the development of CD4+ T cells , which are essential for initiating graft-versus-host disease (GVHD). Bare Lymphocyte Syndrome: Typically caused by mutations in transcription factors essential for the expression of Class II MHC genes . The absence of Class II MHC molecules leads to the underdevelopment of CD4+ T cells , which play a crucial role in cellular immunity and assist B cells. As a result, Class II MHC deficiency results in a combined immunodeficiency. Additionally, other forms of the syndrome can be caused by mutations in antigen receptor chains or signalling molecules critical for the maturation of T or B cells. Complement deficiency (Option A) does not affect T cell function or MHC expression, making it unrelated to GVHD, which requires donor T cell recognition of host MHC. MHC Class II deficiency in lymphocytes (Option C) describes the cause of Bare Lymphocyte Syndrome but does not directly cause GVHD; instead, it prevents CD4 I T cell development, making GVHD unlikely. MHC Class I deficiency in lymphocytes (Option D) affects CD8 I T cell function but does not significantly impair CD4 I T cell-mediated GVHD, which relies on MHC Class II recognition.

This means that γδ T cells can directly interact with certain lipids, glycolipids, and phospholipids, allowing them to respond to lipid antigens independently of MHC presentation. Incorrect Options: Option B - Peptides with MHC proteins: Alpha beta T cell receptors ( αβ TCRs) are predominantly responsible for recognizing peptide antigens, which are typically presented by MHC molecules on the surface of antigen-presenting cells (APCs). Peptides derived from pathogens or abnormal cellular processes are presented by MHC molecules, and αβ TCRs bind to these peptide-MHC complexes to initiate an immune response. Option C - CD20: CD20 is a cell surface protein expressed primarily on the surface of B cells. It is not directly related to the recognition of antigens by T-cell receptors. CD20 is mainly targeted by therapeutic antibodies in the treatment of certain B-cell lymphomas and autoimmune diseases, such as rheumatoid arthritis and multiple sclerosis.

      "explanation": "which is an interleukin involved in the regulation of immune responses, particularly in allergic reactions and parasitic infections. Incorrect Options: Option B - INF-gamma: INF-gamma primarily activates macrophages and plays a role in cellular immune responses. Option C - TNF-alpha: TNF-alpha is a cytokine produced by activated macrophages and other immune cells. Option D - IL-2: IL-2 stimulates the proliferation and activation of T-cells and natural killer (NK) cells. Reference: .",

      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "αβ T-cells and γδ T-cells do not require antigen processing and presentation by major histocompatibility complex (MHC) molecules for recognition. They can recognize and respond to antigens directly, including certain stress-induced molecules and microbial products. Incorrect Options: Kills extracellular bacteria by granulysin and perforin (Option A): γδ T-cells can kill extracellular bacteria through the release of granulysin and perforin, which are cytotoxic molecules. Direct killing of infected macrophages (Option C): γδ T-cells can directly kill infected macrophages, which helps in the control of intracellular infections. Provide protection against mycobacteria (Option D): γδ T-cells have been shown to provide protection against mycobacterial infections, including Mycobacterium tuberculosis, the causative agent of tuberculosis. They contribute to the immune response by producing cytokines and exerting cytotoxic effects. Reference: .",

      "question": "True about anaphylactoid reactions are all except :",
      "options": {
        "A": "Involves degranulation of mast cells",
        "B": "IgE-mediated",
        "C": "Can occur on first exposure",
        "D": "Can be caused by NSAIDs"
      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Unlike true anaphylaxis, anaphylactoid reactions are triggered by non-immunologic mechanisms, such as the direct activation of mast cells or the complement system. Incorrect Options: Option A - Involves degranulation of mast cells: Anaphylactoid reactions involve the rapid release of mediators, such as histamine, from mast cells and basophils. These mediators cause symptoms similar to those seen in anaphylaxis, but anaphylactoid reactions are not IgE-mediated. Option C - Can occur on first exposure: Anaphylactoid reactions can occur on the first exposure to a triggering agent. Unlike some allergic reactions that require sensitization and previous exposure, anaphylactoid reactions can happen without prior exposure or sensitization. Option D - Can be caused by NSAIDs: NSAIDs (non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs) can potentially trigger anaphylactoid reactions, but they are not the most common cause. Anaphylactoid reactions can be caused by various substances, such as certain drugs (e.g., contrast media), radiocontrast dyes, intravenous fluids, and some food additives. It is important to note that anaphylactoid reactions to NSAIDs are not IgE-mediated but rather due to direct activation of mast cells. Reference: .",

      "explanation": "Bence-Jones proteins in urine examination is suggestive of multiple myeloma. In multiple myeloma, abnormal plasma cells accumulate in the bone marrow and produce excessive amounts of a single type of antibody, or immunoglobulin. Bence Jones proteins are fragments of immunoglobulin light chains that are filtered by the kidneys and excreted in the urine. The most common immunoglobulin associated with multiple myeloma is IgG, which accounts for about 50% of cases. IgA is the second most common type, accounting for about 20-25% of cases. IgM is rare in multiple myeloma, and IgD is not typically associated with this condition. Incorrect Options: Options A, B, and D are incorrect. Refer to the explanation of the correct answer.
