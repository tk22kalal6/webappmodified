      "question": "A 20-year-old girl was diagnosed with acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL). Her medical team has determined that a bone marrow transplant is necessary to achieve remission and prevent disease recurrence. She has an identical twin sister, who is an eligible donor. What type of grafting was done on this patient?",

      },
      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Correct answer: C) Isograft Explanation: A graft from an identical twin donor is called an isograft. An isograft is an organ or tissue taken from a donor and transplanted to a recipient with the same genetic constitution as the donor. Type of Graft Description Autograft An organ or tissue is taken from an individual and grafted on him/ herself Isograft Grafts between genetically identical individuals, such as identical twins Allograft Graft between two genetically non-identical members of the same species (e.g. organ transplants between two non-identical and compatible individuals. Xenograft Graft from one species to another (e.g., pig skin is a temporary substitute for burn treatment). Synthetic Graft Artificial materials or bioengineered constructs replace or support damaged tissue (e.g., artificial skin substitutes, bone graft substitutes).

      },
      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "Correct answer: A) 4/6 Explanation: 4/6 HLA matches, 3 alleles from each parent ( hence 6), including HLA-A, HLA-B, and HLA-DR, are required in a pediatric group for allogeneic transplants. Two important aspects to be considered before transplant are ABO blood group matching and HLA matching between donors and recipients. HLA matching is not done for the cornea as it is avascular. It is generally less critical for heart, lung, and liver transplants than hematopoietic stem cell transplants. HLA-A, B, C, DQ, and DR are the main genes targeted to match before transplantation, with HLA-DR being the most important one. For adult hematopoietic stem cell transplants, an ideal match should have a minimum of 8/10 alleles to be considered for transplant. In practice, a match of a minimum of 6/8 alleles targeting HLA-A, B, C, and DR is often used for adult transplants. In children, a match of at least 4/6 genes involving HLA - A, B, and DR is required. Identical twins will always have complete 6/6 matching genes. If these HLA Antigens and Alleles Match Then, the donor is considered to be this type of match: A, B and DRB1 6/6 A, B, C, and DRB1 8/8 A, B, C, DRB1 and DQB1 10/10 A, B, C, DRB1, DQB1 and DPB1 12/12 Reference: Hematology 2022â€”what is a complete HLA match in 2022? - PMC (nih.gov) Kidney transplantation in adults: HLA matching and outcomes - UpToDate",

      "question": "A 35-year-old woman with end-stage renal disease recently received a compatible donor organ from her brother.

      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Correct answer: B) Preformed antibodies in the recipient Explanation: The given clinical scenario suggests hyperacute graft rejection due to preformed antibodies in the recipient. Antibodies specific for antigens on graft endothelial cells immediately react with the graft, leading to endothelial injury, rapid thrombosis and ischemia of the transplanted organ. Hyperacute rejection occurs within minutes to hours after or even during transplantation and is characterised by the following: Mechanism: It is mediated by preformed antibodies in the recipient's blood that react against donor antigens on the graft's vascular endothelium. (Type 2 hypersensitivity reaction) Antibodies involved: These are usually anti-HLA antibodies or ABO blood group antibodies that the recipient has developed due to previous exposures such as pregnancies, blood transfusions, or previous transplants. Pathophysiology: When these antibodies bind to the graft's endothelium, they activate the complement system, leading to rapid thrombosis and occlusion of the graft vessels. Histology: The arterioles of the affected kidney develop acute fibrinoid necrosis, with thrombi narrowing or occluding their lumens. Option C:(cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-mediated injury) and D (CD4+ cell-mediated inflammation) are involved in acute cellular rejection, which occurs days to weeks after transplantation, not within minutes, as described in this scenario. Hyperacute graft rejection can be prevented by cross-matching ABO and HLA of donor and recipient before transplantation Histological findings: Hyperacute rejection of a kidney allograft showing platelet fibrin thrombi and severe ischemic injury in a glomerulus.",

      "question": "A 45-year-old man, two months post-kidney transplant, presents with sudden oliguria, fever, and graft site swelling. Biopsy shows glomerular and peritubular capillary inflammation with complement deposition. What is the most likely diagnosis?",

      },
      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "Correct answer: A) Acute humoral rejection Explanation: Acute humoral rejection, also known as acute antibody-mediated rejection (ABMR), is the most likely diagnosis. The presentation occurs two months post-transplant, which is a typical timeframe for acute humoral rejection. It usually occurs within the first year after transplantation but can happen at any time. Acute humoral rejection Acute cellular rejection Acute humoral rejection mediated by newly synthesized antibodies. It causes endothelial damage and complement activation. Type II or IV hypersensitivity. No response to increasing doses of immunosuppressive drugs. Treatment: B cell depleting agents. Microscopic appearance: Fibrinoid necrosis in vessels. Deposition of C4d in peritubular capillaries. (Complement breakdown product). C4d is the marker for acute humoral rejection. Mediated by CD4+ or CD8+ T cells. Type IV hypersensitivity reaction. Responsive to increasing doses of immunosuppressive drugs. Microscopic appearance: Tubulointerstitial pattern: Tubulitis : Destruction of tubules + inflammatory cells in tubules. mononuclear inflammatory infiltrate. vascular pattern: Endothelitis CD8+ T cells directly destroy graft cells, or CD4+ cells secrete cytokines and induce inflammation, which damages the graft. Two types of cellular graft rejection: In the tubulointerstitial pattern, there is extensive interstitial inflammation and tubulitis. In the vascular pattern, there is inflammation of vessels and necrosis of vessel walls. Clinical presentation: Sudden oliguria indicates a rapid decline in graft function Fever and graft site swelling are consistent with an inflammatory process These symptoms suggest an acute rejection episode rather than a more gradual process Biopsy findings: The biopsy shows inflamed kidney filters and small blood vessels with complement proteins. Inflammation in glomeruli and peritubular capillaries is a hallmark of antibody-mediated injury Complement deposition indicates activation of the complement cascade by antibodies Acute graft rejection can be prevented by Immunosuppression drugs. Acute calcineurin inhibitor nephrotoxicity (Option B) : Typically doesn't cause fever or graft site swelling. Biopsy in this condition shows tubular injury and arteriolar hyalinosis, rather than the glomerular inflammation or complement deposition seen in this case. Acute cellular rejection (Option C) : While acute cellular rejection can cause fever and graft dysfunction, its biopsy findings differ from this case. It shows tubulitis and T-cell infiltration, not complement deposition. This type of rejection is T-cell mediated, unlike the antibody-mediated process suggested by the biopsy findings here. BK virus infection (Option D) : This usually presents more gradually, 2- 6 months post-transplant, due to immunosuppression, and rarely causes fever or graft swelling. Biopsy in BK virus infection shows viral cytopathic changes in tubular cells (decoy cells), not the glomerular inflammation described.

      "question": "A 45-year-old male patient presents with a widespread rash, severe diarrhoea, and jaundice. He underwent bonemarrow transplantation for acute myeloid leukaemia and received cells from a matched, unrelated donor. Which is the most likely diagnosis?",

      },
      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: C) Graft-versus-host disease Explanation: The given clinical presentation and history of hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) transplant suggests that the patient most likely has graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) GVHD occurs when immunologically competent cells of the donor are transplanted into immunocompromised recipients, and donor cells recognise antigens in the host and attack them. This is seen in HSC transplantation, transplantation of solid organs rich in lymphoid cells (e.g., liver), or transfusion of unirradiated blood. Immunocompetent T cells in donor tissue recognise the recipientâ€™s HLA antigens as foreign and react against them. Acute GVHD occurs within days to weeks after allogeneic HSC transplantation. Major affected organs: skin (rash), liver (jaundice), and intestines (diarrhoea). Chronic GVHD can lead to fibrosis and long-term complications. Prevention includes T-cell depletion of donor cells before transfusion or bone marrow transplantation. In acute/ chronic graft rejection, the recipient's immune system attacks the graft; while in GVHD, donor T cells attack the recipient's HLA antigens. Acute/ chronic graft rejection presents as the failure of graft function, local site inflammation and fever. Immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome (IRIS) (Option D): Immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome (IRIS) is an exaggerated immune response that occurs in HIV-infected patients after antiretroviral therapy (ART). HIV patients are immunocompromised, so if TB infection occurs in them, there is less inflammatory response in the body against TB. But if ART therapy is given before ATT, their immunity improves and an exaggerated immune response occurs against TB leading to IRIS. To prevent IRIS, ATT therapy is started first in patients diagnosed with HIV + TB, and 2 weeks later ART therapy is begun. IRIS can also occur in transplant recipients after immunosuppression withdrawal.

Its detection in peritubular capillaries is linked to the antibody-mediated rejection process in acute humoral rejection. Image: Immunoperoxidase stain shows C4d deposition in peritubular capillaries and a glomerulus. C3d (Option A) : C3d is a breakdown product of the complement component C3 and can indicate complement activation, but it is not the most specific marker for antibody-mediated rejection. C5a (Option B) : C5a is an anaphylatoxin produced during complement activation that has potent inflammatory effects and can recruit neutrophils and macrophages. While it plays a role in inflammation, it is not typically used as a histological marker for antibody-mediated rejection. C3b (Option C): C3b is another breakdown product of C3 and acts as an opsonin that promotes phagocytosis and further complement activation. It is not explicitly used as a marker for antibody-mediated rejection in transplant patients. Reference: Robbins and Cotran Pathologic Basis of Disease 10th ed page 580, 238.",

        "D": "Its morphologic correlate in the lung is bronchiolitis obliterans"
      },
      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "Correct answer: A) Predominantly antibody-mediated reaction Explanation: The clinical scenario suggests chronic transplant rejection, which is predominantly mediated by T cells, not antibodies. T cells react against graft alloantigens and secrete cytokines that stimulate fibroblasts and vascular smooth muscle cells in the graft. Chronic graft rejection is a type 4 > 2 hypersensitivity reaction. The patient's symptoms appear four years post-transplant, which is consistent with chronic rejection. Chronic rejection typically occurs months to years after transplantation. While antibodies can play a role in chronic rejection, the primary mechanism involves T cell-mediated inflammation and fibrosis. (Option A) Histological: Chronic rejection is characterised by interstitial fibrosis, tubular atrophy, and vascular changes, which are more consistent with cell-mediated processes than antibody-mediated damage. Chronic rejection leads to gradual loss of graft function over time, which aligns with the patient's presentation of oliguria after four years. Contrast with acute rejection: Acute rejection typically occurs earlier (within 6 months) post-transplant and has different histological features. Chronic graft rejection is the most common cause of graft failure. Graft arteriosclerosis is caused by T-cell cytokines and antibody deposition in chronic graft rejection.
