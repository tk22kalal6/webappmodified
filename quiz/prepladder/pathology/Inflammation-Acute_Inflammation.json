      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: C) Impaired phagocytosis Explanation: In cases of severe infection or in the presence of large pathogen loads, the process of phagocytosis may become ineffective, resulting in incomplete or impaired phagocytosis which is known as ‘Frustrated Phagocytosis.’ In the clinical scenario described, the presence of cavitary lesions in the lung parenchyma is most likely associated with impaired phagocytosis, where phagocytes are unable to effectively clear pathogens or cellular debris. This impaired phagocytosis can lead to tissue damage and necrosis, contributing to the formation of cavitary lesions. Examples of Frustrated Phagocytosis: Glomerulonephritis : Immune complexes deposited in glomeruli trigger enzyme release, causing kidney damage. Foreign Bodies : Large materials like asbestos or surgical sutures resist engulfment, leading to chronic inflammation. Granulomas (Tuberculosis): Persistent mycobacteria in granulomas cause phagocyte-mediated tissue destruction. Parasites : Large parasites like Schistosoma trigger eosinophil and macrophage degranulation, damaging tissues. Atherosclerosis : Macrophages release toxic mediators in response to unengulfable cholesterol crystals, worsening plaque inflammation. Tumors : Resistant tumor cells or extracellular matrix barriers frustrate phagocytes, promoting inflammation.",

      "explanation": "Correct Answer: B ) Engulfment of live cells by neighbouring cells Explanation: Entosis is a phenomenon where live cells are engulfed and internalized by neighbouring cells, forming cell-in-cell structures. It typically occurs in non-phagocytic cells and can be observed in various physiological and pathological contexts, including tumour microenvironments. In the scenario described, the presence of entotic cells within the ovarian mass indicates that live cells are being engulfed by neighbouring cells within the ovary. Phagocytosis of apoptotic cells by neighbouring cells (Option A) Phagocytosis involves the clearance of dead or apoptotic cells by neighbouring phagocytic cells such as macrophages. However, entosis involves the engulfment of live cells, not apoptotic cells. Fusion of lysosomes within a cell leading to autophagy (Option C) Autophagy is a cellular process involved in the degradation and recycling of cellular components but no engulfment of neighboring cells. Exocytosis of cellular debris from a damaged cell (Option D) Exocytosis is the process by which cells release molecules or cellular components into the extracellular space, and it does not involve the engulfment of neighboring cells.",

      },
      "correct_answer": "D",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: D) NETs directly phagocytose the invading pathogens. Explanation: Neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) are extracellular fibrillar networks that concentrate antimicrobial substances at sites of infection and trap microbes, helping to prevent their spread. NETs do not directly phagocytose or engulf the invading pathogens (Option D) . Instead, they trap pathogens within their structure, immobilizing them and allowing other immune cells, such as macrophages, to recognize and eliminate them. They are produced by neutrophils in response to infectious pathogens (mainly bacteria and fungi) and inflammatory mediators (e.g., chemokines, cytokines, complement proteins, and ROS). (Option A) NET formation starts with ROS-dependent activation of an arginine deaminase that converts arginines to citrulline, leading to chromatin decondensation. NETs are composed of nuclear chromatin and various granule proteins, including antimicrobial peptides and enzymes that help to neutralize and kill pathogens trapped within the NETs. (Option B) Activated neutrophils release histones into the extracellular space which helps to unwind and release the DNA, allowing it to combine with granule proteins and form the characteristic web-like structure of NETs. (Option C) They have been detected in conditions like sepsis, emphasizing their importance in immune protection. The nuclear chromatin in the NETs, which includes histones and associated DNA, has been postulated to be a source of nuclear antigens in systemic autoimmune diseases, particularly lupus, in which individuals react against their own DNA and nucleoproteins. A neutrophil granulocyte (yellow) has ejected a NET (green) to capture bacteria (purple). A red blood cell (orange) is also trapped in the NET.",

        "D": "Leucocyte rolling."
      },
      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: C) Microbial engulfment Explanation: Microbial engulfment refers to the process by which phagocytes engulf and internalize pathogens for destruction. Opsonization plays a critical role in this process by coating pathogens with opsonins, that enhance phagocytosis. Reduced opsonization activity in serum directly impacts microbial engulfment, as pathogens are less efficiently recognized and phagocytosed by immune cells. Opsonins are substances that coat pathogens or foreign particles, making them more recognizable and easier for phagocytic cells to engulf. They act as \"handles\" that bind to both the pathogen and the receptor on the phagocyte. Opsonin is divided into 3 Categories: IgG (Most important opsonin) Complement proteins (C 3b , C 4b , C 5b ): The most important complement opsonin C 3b Plasma Protein (E.g., Fibrinogen) Opsonization is the process through which opsonins mark foreign particles for destruction by phagocytes. It involves the following steps: Binding of opsonins to the surface of the pathogen. For example, antibodies or complement proteins like C3b bind to antigens or microbial surfaces. Recognition by phagocytes : Phagocytes have receptors (e.g., Fc receptors for antibodies, complement receptors for C3b) that specifically bind to opsonins. This allows the phagocyte to recognize the pathogen more efficiently. Phagocytosis : The phagocyte engulfs the opsonized pathogen, internalizing it in a phagosome. The pathogen is then killed and digested by enzymes within the phagocyte. Complement activation, Diapedesis, and Leukocyte rolling (Option A, B and D) are not affected by reduced opsonization.",

It leads to the widening of blood vessels, increased blood flow, and subsequent redness (erythema) and warmth at the site of inflammation. While vasodilation is an important aspect of the inflammatory response, it is not considered the hallmark event. Stasis (Option C): Stasis, characterized by sluggish blood flow and the accumulation of leukocytes along the vascular endothelium, is a consequence of increased vascular permeability and contributes to the inflammatory process but is not the primary hallmark event.

        "D": "Hypothermia, acidosis, and coagulopathy"
      },
      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: A) Endothelial injury, hypercoagulability, and venous stasis Explanation: Virchow's triad consists of three primary factors that contribute to thrombosis: Endothelial injury - Triggers platelet adhesion and clot formation. Stasis or turbulent blood flow - Disrupts normal anticoagulant processes, promoting thrombosis. Hypercoagulability of the blood - An increased tendency of blood to clot, often due to genetic or acquired conditions.
