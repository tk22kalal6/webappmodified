      },
      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: A) SCC Explanation: The histopathological image showing keratin pearls on histopathology is suggestive of Squamous Cell Carcinoma (SCC) . It is a malignant tumour originating from epidermal keratinocytes. It is the second most common skin tumour after basal cell carcinoma (BCC). SCC is notably the most common skin tumour in immunocompromised individuals . Predisposing factors include UV exposure, immunosuppression, and conditions like xeroderma pigmentosum, albinism, LP, and DLE, which can rarely progress into SCC. Clinical features: It typically exhibits a lower rate of local, regional, and distant spread compared to other skin malignancies. Associated with immunocompromised states such as HIV infection and renal transplant recipients. It presents as papules, nodules, or plaques with induration and signs of photodamage like crusting and scaling. Histopathological examination reveals characteristic keratin pearls . Treatment: Primary treatment involves wide surgical excision with margins. Advanced cases may require radiation or chemotherapy. BCC (Basal Cell Carcinoma) (Option B) is the most common type of skin cancer , originating from the basal cells in the epidermis. It is typically slow-growing, often appearing as a painless, pearly nodule with telangiectasias on sun-exposed areas like the face. Histologically, BCC is characterised by nests of basaloid cells with a palisading pattern at the periphery, fibrotic stroma, and clefting between the tumour and surrounding tissue. Molluscum contagiosum (Option C) is a viral skin infection causing small, flesh-coloured lesions with central umbilication, often in children and immunocompromised individuals. Histologically, it shows epidermal hyperplasia, ballooning keratinocytes, and Henderson-Patterson (HP) bodies in cup-shaped spaces. Verrucous carcinoma (Option D) is a rare, low-grade squamous cell carcinoma often found in areas with chronic irritation (e.g., oral cavity, genitals). It",

      },
      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: A) Basal cell carcinoma Explanation: The histopathological image of the skin biopsy reveals nests of basaloid cells with peripheral palisading and a distinctive stromal retraction artefact, characteristic of Basal Cell Carcinoma (BCC), also known as Rodent Ulcer. It is the most common type of skin cancer and is typically seen in sun-exposed areas of the skin. It is a slow-growing, locally invasive tumour, and it rarely metastasises. Origin: Arises from pluripotent cells within the basal layer of the epidermis or follicular structures. Pathogenesis: Site: Face, Around eyes, Nose Clinical Features It presents initially small, scaly plaque. They present as pearly papules containing dilated blood vessels (telangiectasias) They may ulcerate locally and invade the underlying bone or facial sinuses (rodent ulcers). Slow progressive course of peripheral extension. Histologically: The tumour cells are basophilic cells with hyperchromatic nuclei (basaloid cells) arranged in clusters with a palisading pattern . The stroma sometimes retracts from the malignant cells. Treatment Medical: Imiquimod, 5-FU,Intralesional interferon α -2b Hedgehog pathway inhibitors:(Vismodegib) Surgical: Mohs micrographic surgery, Done in recurrent BCCs. Squamous cell Carcinoma (Option B) typically exhibits keratin pearls and intercellular bridges, features not present in the image provided. Additionally, the cells are generally larger and have more abundant cytoplasm, unlike the smaller basaloid cells seen in BCC. Adenocarcinoma (Option C) arises from glandular epithelium and shows glandular structures or mucin production. Malignant Melanoma (Option D) is characterised by atypical melanocytes, which can be seen in various configurations, such as nests or single cells within the epidermis and dermis. These cells often contain melanin pigment.",

      "question": "An 8-year-old boy presents with progressive muscle weakness and walking difficulties. On examination, pseudohypertrophy of the calf muscles was noted. Which of the following is true regarding this condition?",
      "options": {
        "A": "Abnormal collagen",
        "B": "Absent dystrophin",
        "C": "Expansions of CAG triplet repeats",
        "D": "Defective fibrillin"
      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: B) Absent dystrophin Explanation: The patient described is likely suffering from Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) , a genetic disorder characterised by progressive muscle weakness, particularly in the lower limbs, with pseudohypertrophy of the calf muscles . This condition is caused by a mutation in the dystrophin gene , resulting in the absence or severe deficiency of dystrophin , a protein that helps anchor the muscle cell membrane. Aspect Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy (DMD) Type of Mutation Frameshift mutations lead to a disrupted reading frame Dystrophin Protein Dystrophin deficient Truncated and unstable (< 3% of normal) Clinical Severity Severe, early onset, rapid progression Inheritance Pattern X-linked recessive. Age of onset Early childhood (Before 5 years) Incorrect Options: Abnormal collagen (Option A) would be more consistent with conditions like Ehlers-Danlos syndrome or osteogenesis imperfecta , which involve defective collagen synthesis. Dystrophinopathies, like DMD, do not primarily involve collagen. Expansion of CAG triplet repeats (Option C) can cause Huntington's disease or fragile X syndrome, but DMD is caused by a mutation in the dystrophin gene , not CAG repeats. Defective fibrillin (Option D) is the cause of Marfan syndrome , which affects connective tissue and is characterized by features like tall stature, long limbs, and aortic dissection, but it is not involved in muscle degeneration like DMD.

      "question": "A patient underwent surgery for lipoma 5 weeks ago and now presents with a scar at the incision site, which is limited to the original wound boundaries. What is the most likely diagnosis?",
      "options": {
        "A": "Keloid",
        "B": "Exuberant granulation",
        "C": "Hypertrophic scar",
        "D": "Granulation tissue"
      },
      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: C) Hypertrophic scar Explanation: The most likely diagnosis is a hypertrophic scar, characterised by a raised scar confined to the original wound boundaries, unlike keloids that extend beyond the wound. It is marked by excess collagen, rapid growth, and the presence of myofibroblasts. Hypertrophic scars tend to regress over time and recur less frequently than keloids. Keloid: (Option A) Scar grows beyond the original wound boundaries and doesn’t regress. More common among African Americans. Develops after deep dermal injuries. Exuberant Granulation Tissue: (Option B) Excessive granulation tissue above skin level. Blocks reepithelialisation (also called \"proud flesh\"). Requires cauterisation or surgical excision for healing Contractures: Abnormal tightening of the wound and surrounding tissues. Common in palms, soles, and chest. Seen in severe burns, it may impair joint movement.",

      },
      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: A) Pemphigus Vulgaris Explanation: The histopathological image shows Pemphigus Vulgaris (PV) , with intraepidermal cleavage and acantholysis in the suprabasal layer, along with a \"row of tombstones\" appearance due to the separation of basal keratinocytes at the basement membrane zone. It is the most common chronic autoimmune blistering disease caused by antibodies against desmosomal adhesion proteins. The target antigens for PV are most commonly Desmoglein 3 and sometimes Desmoglein 1. Clinical features: Flaccid blisters filled with clear fluid present on normal skin or an erythematous base. The blisters rupture, producing painful erosion. Mucosal involvement is a very important and one of the distinguishing features of PV. Histopathology: Intraepidermal cleavage with acantholysis (detached keratinocytes) primarily localized to the suprabasal region. Separation of basal keratinocytes along the basement membrane zone, resulting in an appearance that resembles a \"row of tombstones\". Leprosy (Option B) , also known as Hansen's disease , is a chronic infection caused by Mycobacterium leprae , affecting the skin, peripheral nerves, and mucous membranes.",

      "question": "A 5-year-old child who presented with proptosis of one of the eyes was found to have a desmin-positive tumour. What is the probable diagnosis?",
      "options": {
        "A": "Ewing’s sarcoma",
        "B": "Embryonal rhabdomyosarcoma",
        "C": "Leukaemia",
        "D": "Retinoblastoma"
      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: B) Embryonal Rhabdomyosarcoma Explanation: The clinical presentation of a 5-year-old child with proptosis and a desmin-positive tumour suggests embryonal rhabdomyosarcoma (RMS). Desmin is a marker for muscle differentiation, and rhabdomyosarcoma, a malignant tumour of skeletal muscle origin, is common in children and can present with proptosis if it involves the orbit. Rhabdomyosarcoma (RMS) Origin A malignant tumour arising from skeletal muscle progenitors Types Embryonal rhabdomyosarcoma. Alveolar rhabdomyosarcoma. Pleomorphic rhabdomyosarcoma. Spindle cell/sclerosing rhabdomyosarcoma Clinical features It is the most common soft tissue sarcoma in children and adolescents. It commonly presents in the extremities. Pediatric rhabdomyosarcomas mostly arise in the sinuses, head and neck, and genitourinary tract. IHC Positive Markers Desmin Myogenin MyoD1 Muscle-specific actin Gross appearance The tumours are often large, soft, and infiltrative, with areas of necrosis and haemorrhage. Microscopy Small, round to spindle-shaped cells with hyperchromatic nuclei and scant cytoplasm, sometimes with a myxoid stroma, are also seen. Ewing’s sarcoma (Option A) is a malignant tumour typically affecting bones or soft tissues, often seen in children and adolescents. It is characterized by a specific genetic translocation (t(11;22)) and is usually not associated with desmin positivity, which is more typical of rhabdomyosarcoma. Ewing's sarcoma may cause localized swelling or pain but rarely presents with proptosis unless it involves the orbit or surrounding tissues. It is composed of sheets of uniform, small, round cells with scant cytoplasm that may be clear due to abundant glycogen. Leukaemia (Option C) is a type of cancer that affects the blood and bone marrow, leading to the uncontrolled production of abnormal white blood cells. It typically doesn't present with localized tumours or proptosis. However, in cases of leukemic infiltration of the orbit, proptosis may occur, though it's relatively rare. Retinoblastoma (Option D) is a malignant eye tumour that primarily affects young children, often before the age of 5. While it can cause proptosis due to orbital involvement, it is typically not associated with a desmin-positive tumour. Retinoblastoma usually presents with a white reflex in the pupil (leukocoria) and can cause vision problems or strabismus.",
