      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: C) Lactiferous duct Explanation: Lactiferous ducts are not a part of the TDLU. The morpho-functional unit of the breast is the terminal duct lobular unit(TDLU). TDLU is a grapelike cluster of small alveoli that comprises lobule and terminal duct. A lobule is a collection of multiple ductules, which are epithelial structures that produce milk during lactation. Terminal ducts consist of 2 parts: Intralobular terminal duct: A portion of the terminal duct located within the lobule. Extralobular terminal duct is the portion connecting the lobule to the lactiferous duct.",

      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: B) Staphylococcus aureus Explanation: The clinical scenario suggests acute breast abscess from lactational mastitis which is commonly caused by Staphylococcus aureus . It is caused by a local infection through cracks and fissures in the nipples that occur commonly during the 1st month of breastfeeding. It is often preceded by either engorgement or a focally blocked duct. Patients can develop a focal area of erythema, pain, fever, and swelling. This can further develop into single or multiple abscesses. Streptococcus pyogenes, Escherichia coli, Bacteroides species, and coagulase-negative Staphylococci are other organisms that cause mastitis.

      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: B) Duct ectasia Explanation: The patient presenting with breast pain, nipple discharge, and palpable subareolar mass most likely has duct ectasia. Mammary duct ectasia is a benign, non-proliferative breast disease that affects large ducts. It is most common in women who are nearing menopause, typically between the ages of 45 and 55. The breast ducts become clogged with thick secretion and debris, leading to dilation of the duct. Symptoms Nipple discharge, which can be clear, green, brown, or bloody Breast tenderness or pain , especially around the nipple A tender lump in the subareolar or periareolar region of a breast Inward retraction of the nipple due to repeated episodes and scarring A transverse slit-like or fish-mouth-like retraction of the nipple is classically seen in periductal mastitis but circumferential retraction may indicate a carcinoma. Ductal ectasia is often diagnosed during a routine mammogram or breast exam and managed by excision. If a lump is found, a biopsy may be needed to rule out cancer.",

      "correct_answer": "D",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: D) Alcohol is a risk factor Explanation: Alcohol is a major risk factor in Zuska’s disease along with smoking. Zuska’s disease is also known as Squamous metaplasia of lactiferous ducts(SMOLD), recurrent subareolar abscess, or periductal mastitis. The risk factors include a deficiency of vitamin A associated with smoking(90% of cases). This leads to k eratinizing squamous metaplasia of the ductal epithelium, which is cuboidal. Keratin released from these cells blocks the ductal system. This leads to the formation of subareolar abscess, dilation, and eventually, the rupture of the duct, causing fistulas.

Breast fat necrosis is caused by injured or ischemic breast tissue that is replaced with scar tissue and presents as a palpable nodule. It is commonly caused by breast trauma and breast surgical procedures. It presents as a mammographic density , a painless palpable lump, skin thickening, or deposits of calcium. Fat necrosis can manifest in a variety of ways that closely resemble cancer like irregular breast mass, usually fixed to the dermis, with possible skin tethering and/or nipple retraction as a result of fibrotic bands between necrotic tissue and skin. Calcifications can sometimes occur in fat necrosis, particularly in older lesions.",

Fibrocystic changes of the breast is a benign condition characterized by the development of cysts, fibrosis (thickening and scarring of tissue), and other benign alterations in the breast tissue. Symptoms Breast pain (mastalgia) or tenderness that fluctuates with menstruation Mastalgia (or mastodynia) can be cyclic (with menses, due to premenstrual edema) or noncyclic (localized to one area of the breast and may be caused by ruptured cysts, physical injury, and infections). Breast lumps or nodules Swelling or enlargement of the breasts Fluid-filled cysts with varying size Nipple discharge Gross Features: Blue-domed cyst of Bloodgood- Large cysts that contain turbid, semitranslucent brown or blue-colored fluid which imparts a blue color onto the intact cyst. They are typically fluid-filled and may vary in size. Histopathological Features: Cysts: Fluid-filled sacs within the breast tissue, often surrounded by fibrous tissue. Fibrosis: Thickening and scarring of breast tissue, which may result in palpable lumps or areas of increased density on imaging studies.

The FNAC features of a fibroadenoma include Staghorn clusters of cells - Ductal cells arranged in a deer horn-like pattern. Bare nuclei - cytoplasm is stripped off and only nuclei are visible in blue color. Intracanalicular Fibroadenoma : Other features of Fibroadenoma : Fibroadenoma is the most common benign breast tumor, typically found in women aged 15-35. Spherical masses measuring 1-10 cm, firm, non-tender, well-circumscribed, mobile, and often single . The lump is mobile and slippery and hence called breast mouse . Estrogen sensitivity: Can increase in size during pregnancy, lactation, or estrogen therapy, and usually regress after menopause. Histopathology: Well-defined borders due to a fibrous capsule , with proliferating stroma potentially compressing and distorting glandular components. Popcorn calcification on mammograms. Aging effect: Epithelium atrophies with age, and the stroma becomes more hyalinized. Molecular alteration: Alterations in MED12 gene Drug associated with bilateral fibroadenomas: Cyclosporine ( A calcineurin inhibitor) Management: Surgical excision Indications for surgical excision: Age >30 years Size >5 cm Microlobulation on imaging Atypia on histology Family history of breast cancer, and The patient’s preference",

Explanation: The clinical features and HPE showing increased stromal cellularity and overgrowth, giving rise to the typical leaf-like architecture, suggests phyllodes tumor. The incorrect statement is that these lesions are always benign. Phyllodes tumors also called cystosarcoma phyllodes are stromal tumors developing from the connective tissue of the breast. It occurs in middle-aged wome n (40-50y). Most phyllodes tumors are benign (noncancerous), but a small number (about 10% to 15%) can be borderline or malignant (cancerous). They present as a lump in the breast. The lump may be firm, smooth, and well-defined . It may also grow quickly from a few centimeters to massive lesions involving the entire breast. HPE shows increased stromal cellularity and overgrowth, giving rise to the typical leaf-like architecture. Phyllodes tumor is differentiated from fibroadenoma based on its overgrowth of stroma, increased mitotic activity and cellularity, and nuclear pleomorphism. Treatment: Wide local excision (WLE) with a 2-cm margin along with the overlying skin and underlying pectoralis major muscle. Mastectomy for massive, recurrent, or malignant tumours Postoperative radiotherapy and systemic chemotherapy. Reference: Robbins & Cotran Pathologic Basis of Disease, 10th Edition, Page No.1062-63.
