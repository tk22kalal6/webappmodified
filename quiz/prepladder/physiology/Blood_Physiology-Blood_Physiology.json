      },
      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer : C) Bone marrow suppression Explanation: The presence of older neutrophils (N4 and N5) indicates suppression of bone marrow with a shift to the right in Arneth count. The Arneth count is a method used to classify neutrophils as N1 to N5 based on the number of lobes in their nuclei. Classification of Neutrophil Class I : Myelocytes and neutrophils with indented or horseshoe-shaped nuclei. (5%) Class II : Neutrophils with bilobed nuclei. (35%) Class III : Neutrophils with tri-lobed nuclei. (41%) Class IV : Neutrophils with four-lobed nuclei. (17%) Class V : Neutrophils with five or more lobes in their nuclei. (2%) Toxic Conditions Fewer cells in Classes IV and V indicate a left-sided shift Active tuberculosis often shows a left shift. (Option A) Other infections showing a left shift may have superimposed tuberculosis Extrinsic Factors Influencing Arneth Count Certain drugs, tissue extracts, and hormones. Trauma , various forms of radiation. Induction of anesthesia. Infections and Arneth Count Acute progressive infections: Notable left shift. (Option B) As infection subsides: Less marked left shift, may shift to the right. Chronic infections: Other features like lymphocytosis come into range. Normal Neutrophil Distribution N1 and N3 constitute most neutrophils in peripheral blood. Bone Marrow Stimulation Presence of younger neutrophils (N1 and N2) indicates stimulation of bone marrow (shift to the left). (Option D) Bone Marrow Suppression Presence of older cells (N4 and N5) indicates suppression of bone marrow (shift to right) (Option C) Hypersegmented Neutrophil Seen in megaloblastic anemia due to folate and vitamin B12 deficiency (shift to right) Reference: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC382513/ GK Pal Comprehensive Textbook of Medical Physiology, 1st Edition, Page 133-134.",

      "question": "A pediatrician is reviewing the development of hematopoiesis in a fetus at various stages of gestation. They are particularly interested in understanding the shifts in hematopoietic activity locations as the fetus develops. At which gestational age does the bone marrow become the primary site of hematopoiesis?",
      "options": {
        "A": "3-6 weeks",
        "B": "6-8 weeks",
        "C": "Around 20 weeks",
        "D": "At birth"
      },
      "correct_answer": "D",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: D) At birth Explanation: At birth, hemopoiesis stops in liver and gets confined only to the bone marrow. Thus bone marrow becomes the primary site for hematopoiesis at birth . When hemopoiesis occurs in liver and spleen in postnatal life, is called extramedullary hemopoiesis . Stage Location Key Points Mesoblastic Yolk sac, PSP, AGM Yolk sac: Multilineage differentiating capabilities (starts functioning by the 2nd week of gestation). Non-yolk sac regions: Para Aortic splanchnopleura (PSP) and aorta-gonad mesonephros (AGM) regions. PSP: Gives rise to B-cell progenitors. AGM: Contains pluripotent stem cells. Hepatic Liver, spleen 2nd trimester of pregnancy. Liver: Hematopoiesis starts at the 5th week, peaks at the 5th month, and ceases at birth. Spleen: Hematopoiesis mainly in the 2nd trimester, less than liver. Postnatal: Normally does not occur in liver and spleen unless demand is high (extramedullary hemopoiesis). Medullary Bone marrow (medullary hemopoiesis). Marrow cavities appear by the 5th month (around 20 weeks) of fetal life, and become hemopoietic. (Option C) Initial phase: Bone marrow exclusive for granulocytic and megakaryocytic proliferation. Erythropoiesis starts in bone marrow towards the end of the 3rd trimester, and continues throughout life. Postnatal: Hemopoiesis confined to bone marrow, extramedullary hemopoiesis abnormal. Option A : At 3 to 6 weeks , hematopoiesis occur in yolk sac which starts functioning from 2 weeks of gestational age known as Mesoblastic stage. Option B : At 6 to 8 weeks , hematopoiesis occur in liver which starts functioning from 5 weeks of gestational age, peaks at 5th month and ceases at birth , known as Hepatic stage. Option C : Around 20 week s : Hematopoiesis starts to occur in the bone marrow around 20 weeks but liver becomes the major site of hematopoiesis.",

Single cell from the 8-cell embryo stage. Pluripotent Stem Cells Can generate the entire organism except the placenta. Cells from the inner cell mass of the blastocyst. Multipotent Stem Cells Can form only one lineage of cells. Hematopoietic stem cells that give rise to various blood cell types. Steps in hematopoiesis: Multipotent Stem Cell § Progenitor Cell § Precursor Cell § Mature Cell Mature Cell: Differentiated cell with decreased self-renewal and proliferation properties. Hematopoietic Stem Cells: Convert to multipotent stem cells, giving rise to two progenitor types. Memory B and T Cells are mature cells but have the ability to self-renew and proliferate. Asymmetric division (Option A) – Maintains homeostasis by generating one stem cell and one differentiated cell , rather than expanding the pool. Terminal differentiation (Option C) – Leads to fully specialized cells with no further division Lateral inhibition (Option D) – A process in which a cell inhibits its neighboring cells from adopting the same fate, playing a role in cell differentiation rather than expanding the stem cell pool.",

Erythropoietin is synthesized from: Kidney (around 90%) (Option A) Liver Brain The major stimulus for erythropoietin production is Low oxygen levels or tissue hypoxia (Option B) . When there is tissue hypoxia, erythropoietin acts on Burst forming unit-Erythroid (BFU-E), converting them into colony forming unit-Erythroid (CFU-E), which has the maximum erythropoietin receptor density (Option D) .

      "explanation": "Correct Answer: C) Hemopexin Explanation: Hemopexin is a primary protein that is responsible for binding and transporting free heme in the bloodstream. When RBC undergoes hemolysis, heme is released into the blood. Free heme is potentially toxic due to its ability to generate reactive oxygen species and cause oxidative damage. Hemopexin binds to free heme with high affinity, facilitating safe transport of the liver for degradation and prevention of toxicity (option D). Haptoglobin binds free hemoglobin, but not free heme (Option A) Albumin maintains osmotic pressure and serves as a carrier protein for various substances, including hormones, fatty acids, and drugs, but is not a carrier of heme (Option B) Transferrin is responsible for transfer of iron in the bloodstream.
