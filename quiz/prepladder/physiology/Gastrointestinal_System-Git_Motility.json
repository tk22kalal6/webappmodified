      "explanation": "Correct Answer: D) Hypotonic solution in duodenum Explanation: Hypotonic solutions do not inhibit gastric emptying. In fact, they may even promote faster gastric emptying due to their lower osmolarity. Factors Promoting Gastric Emptying: Factor Mechanism Vagal stimulation Stimulates antral contraction, promoting gastric emptying Liquid meal Faster gastric emptying due to lower viscosity and faster transit through the stomach Motilin Stimulates antral contraction and gastric emptying, especially during the interdigestive state Factors Inhibiting Gastric Emptying: Factor Mechanism Acid in the duodenum Releases secretin, inhibiting antral contraction and stimulating pyloric sphincter contraction Products of fat digestion Releases CCK and GIP, inhibiting gastric emptying Hypertonic solutions in the duodenum Releases hormones inhibiting gastric emptying Products of protein digestion Releases gastrin, CCK, and GIP, inhibiting gastric emptying Large meal volume (solids) Prolongs gastric emptying time Stretching of duodenum Initiates enterogastric reflex, inhibiting gastric emptying Sympathetic stimulation Decreased gastric motility (by norepinephrine) and increased pyloric sphincter tone.

      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: C) Interstitial cells of Cajal Explanation: Basal Electrical Rhythm: Except in the oesophagus and proximal portion of the stomach, the smooth muscle of the GIT has spontaneous rhythmic fluctuations in membrane potential between -65 and -45 mV. The interstitial cells of Cajal are stellate mesenchymal pacemaker cells with smooth muscle-like features that send long, multiply branched processes into the intestinal smooth muscle, generating the basal electrical rhythm (BER) . The function of BER is to coordinate peristaltic and other motor activity, such as setting the rhythm of segmentation and contraction only during the depolarising part of the wave. Spike potentials superimposed on the most depolarising portions of the BER waves do increase muscle tension (figure below). The depolarising portion of each spike is due to calcium influx, and the repolarising portion is due to potassium efflux. Acetylcholine increases the number of spikes and tension of the smooth muscle, whereas Epinephrine decreases them. The rate of BER: Stomach: 4/min. Distal ileum: 8/min. Duodenum: 12/min. The BER rate in the colon is about 2/min at the cecum and about 6/min at the sigmoid colon.",

        "A": "Segmentation",
        "B": "Peristalsis",
        "C": "Tonic contractions",
        "D": "Mass movement"
      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: B) Peristalsis Explanation: Peristalsis: Reflex response is initiated by the stretching of the gut wall due to the contents of the lumen. Location: It occurs throughout the gastrointestinal tract, from the esophagus to the rectum. Mechanism: Stretching triggers circular contraction behind the stimulus and relaxation in front of it. The wave of contraction moves in an oral-to-caudal direction. Propels the contents of the lumen forward at rates of 2 to 25 cm/s. Regulation: Peristaltic activity is influenced by autonomic input but occurs independently of extrinsic innervation. Local stretch releases serotonin, activating sensory neurons that stimulate the myenteric plexus. Cholinergic neurons in the myenteric plexus: In retrograde direction: release substance P and acetylcholine, causing contraction behind the bolus. In anterograde direction: activate the neurons releasing nitric oxide (NO) and vasoactive intestinal polypeptide (VIP), causing relaxation ahead of the bolus (Figure below). Functional Integration: Peristalsis is an example of the integrated activity of the enteric nervous system. Reference: Ganong’s Review of Medical Physiology, 26th Edition, Page 485",

        "A": "Enterogastric reflex",
        "B": "Gastrocolic reflex",
        "C": "Rectocolic reflex",
        "D": "Colorectal reflex"
      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: B) Gastrocolic reflex Explanation: Mass Movement in Colon: Coordinated contractions of the colon that propel faecal material towards the rectum. Gastrocolic reflex: The gastrocolic reflex is initiated when food accumulates in the stomach. Distention of the stomach causes motility of the proximal and distal colon. This reflex increases the motility of the colon in response to the stretching of the stomach walls after food intake. This pushes colonic content into the rectum, stimulating the desire for defecation. Therefore, the urge for defecation is usually enhanced after eating a large meal. This reflex is more pronounced in children. The gastrocolic reflex can be more active in children, often leading to a more immediate urge to defecate after eating. Both hormonal and neural factors mediate the gastrocolic reflex. While gastrin, a hormone secreted by the stomach in response to gastric distension, plays a role, neural factors also contribute to the reflex. The involvement of the enteric and autonomic nervous systems is significant in mediating this reflex.",

        "B": "Segmentation",
        "C": "Mass movement",
        "D": "Propulsion"
      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: B) Segmentation Explanation: Segmentation: The enteric nervous system promotes a motility pattern that is related to peristalsis but retards the movement of intestinal contents along the length of the intestinal tract to provide time for digestion and absorption. This is the most common movement of the small intestine. It is characterised by closely spaced contractions of the circular muscle layer. These contractions divide the small intestine into many segments. The rate of segmental contraction is the same as the frequency of slow waves. Duodenum: 18/min. Jejunum: 15/min. Ileum: 12/min. Segmentation contractions effectively mix chyme with pancreatic and intestinal secretions. Two nearby propulsive segments force the chyme toward each other into the receiving segment, which efficiently helps in mixing. They also bring the fresh chyme into contact with the mucosal surface. Therefore, segmentation movements are also called mixing movements. They help in the digestion and absorption of nutrients.",

        "D": "The MMC occurs at intervals of approximately 50 minutes in the interdigestive state."
      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: B) The MMC is initiated by motilin and consists of three phases. Explanation: Migrating Motor Complex (MMC): Cyclic, recurring motility pattern occurs in the stomach and small intestine during fasting between meals. The MMC occurs during fasting periods between digestion, not during active digestion. Its primary role is to clear the stomach and small intestine of luminal contents in preparation for the next meal rather than facilitating nutrient absorption. The hormone motilin initiates the MMC. It consists of three distinct phases. Quiescent period (phase I) Period of irregular electrical and mechanical activity (phase II) Burst of regular activity (phase III). The MMC contractions migrate aborally (away from the mouth, towards the rectum) at about 5 cm/min, not orally. The MMC occurs at intervals of approximately 90-100 minutes in the interdigestive state. Gastric secretion, bile flow and pancreatic secretion increased during each MMC. When a meal is ingested, motilin secretion is suppressed, and MMC is abolished until digestion and absorption are complete.",

      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: C) Colon Explanation : The large intestine (colon) has the longest transit time in the gastrointestinal tract. It is responsible for absorbing water and electrolytes from the remaining indigestible food matter and compacting it into feces. Water absorption and stool formation take longer than other gastrointestinal tract segments. Transit Time in Small Intestine and Colon: The First part of the meal reaches the cecum in about 4 hours. All undigested portions have entered the colon in 8 or 9 hours. First remnants of the meal traverse the first third of the colon in 6 hours. The second third of the colon in 9 hours and reach the terminal part of the colon (Sigmoid colon) in 12 hours. From the sigmoid colon to the anus, transport is much slower. 70% of the meal is recovered in stool in 72 hours, but total recovery requires more than a week. Transit time can be observed by monitoring the progress of a small pill that contains sensors and a miniature radio transmitter.

      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: B) Vagus nerve Explanation: Receptive relaxation is a physiological process in which the stomach, specifically the fundus and upper portion of the body, relaxes and accommodates food without significantly increasing internal pressure. Mechanism: This process is vagally mediated and triggered by the movement of the pharynx and oesophagus. Neural Pathway: The brain responds by sending signals back through vagal efferent fibres, releasing neurotransmitters like nitric oxide (NO) and vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP). They relax the stomach muscles, allowing them to expand with minimal pressure increase and aiding digestion. Subsequent Events: Peristalsis begins in the lower portion of the stomach, mixing and grinding the food before it passes through the pylorus and enters the duodenum. Contraction of the distal stomach caused by each wave is called antral systole and can last up to 10 seconds. Waves occur 3-4 times per minute. Contraction of the antrum is followed by sequential contraction of the pyloric region and duodenum. In the antrum, partial contraction ahead of the advancing gastric content prevents solid masses from entering the duodenum. Regurgitation from the duodenum does not normally occur because the contraction of the pyloric segment tends to persist slightly longer than that of the duodenum. Adaptive relaxation: The dilation of the stomach accommodates the food particles that have already entered the stomach. The local vagovagal reflex regulates it.
