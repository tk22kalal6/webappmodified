      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: C) Conn’s syndrome Explanation: The likely diagnosis from the given scenario is Conn's syndrome, also known as primary hyperaldosteronism, which is due to autonomous overproduction of aldosterone, usually from an adrenal adenoma. It is characterised by resistant hypertension, hypokalemia, and metabolic alkalosis. Causes: Aldosterone-producing adenoma (Conn's adenoma) - Most common. Bilateral adrenal hyperplasia. Symptoms often include muscle weakness, fatigue, headaches, and frequent urination. Laboratory findings: Elevated plasma aldosterone levels Suppressed plasma renin activity High aldosterone-to-renin ratio Treatment involves surgical removal of the adenoma and the use of mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists, such as spironolactone and eplerenone. Role of Aldosterone : It acts on the collecting duct to – Increase sodium reabsorption via epithelial sodium channels (ENaC). Enhance potassium secretion through potassium channels (ROMK). Bartter's syndrome(Option A) It is a genetic disorder,childhood-onset, affecting the kidneys, leading to abnormalities in electrolyte reabsorption. Typically presents with low blood pressure, hypokalemia, metabolic alkalosis, elevated renin levels, and high urinary calcium excretion (hypercalciuria). Gitelman's syndrome :( Option B) A genetic disorder affects the distal convoluted tubule of the kidney, leading to hypokalemia, hypomagnesemia, and metabolic alkalosis. Typically presents with low or normal blood pressure and low urinary calcium excretion (hypocalciuria). Liddle's syndrome(Option D) It is a genetic disorder caused by the increased activity of epithelial sodium channels (ENaC), leading to sodium retention and potassium excretion. It has low aldosterone and renin levels and typically presents with hypertension. Reference: Guyton and Hall Textbook of Physiology, 14th Edition, Page 358,384",

      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: B) Facultative reabsorption independent of ADH Explanation: Facultative Reabsorption of water occurs in the in the distal convoluted tubules and collecting ducts under the influence of ADH. Facultative reabsorption of water: When ADH binds to receptors on tubule cell membranes, it triggers the insertion of aquaporin channels. This increases water reabsorption into the bloodstream, helping to conserve water and produce concentrated urine, especially during dehydration or high plasma osmolality. Obligatory reabsorption of water: This occurs primarily in the proximal convoluted tubules and is driven by osmotic gradients and other factors, not directly influenced by ADH. It involves the reabsorption of a significant amount of water and solutes regardless of the body's hydration status.

      "question": "A 52-year-old woman with type 2 diabetes is being monitored for her renal glucose handling. During the monitoring, the clinician noticed that glucose appeared in her urine even at low plasma glucose concentrations. What is the most likely cause?",

        "D": "Increased Glomerular filtration"
      },
      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: A) Splay effect Explanation: The splay effect describes the phenomenon where glucose begins to appear in the urine before reaching the expected renal threshold for glucose reabsorption. This occurs due to variability in the glucose transport capacity across different nephrons and differences in the efficiency of glucose reabsorption. Splay effect: It is the difference between renal threshold and transport maximum value. It arises because some neurons don’t function properly, and few neurons don’t function equally. Due to improper functioning of neurons, the actual renal threshold is less than the predicted threshold. Splay is inversely proportional to avidity, with which the transport mechanism binds the substance it transports. Renal threshold for glucose (Option B) It is the plasma glucose concentration at which glucose starts to appear in the urine, but it does not explain the appearance of glucose in the urine at lower concentrations. Transport maximum (Option C) The transport maximum (Tm) refers to the maximum rate at which the renal tubules can reabsorb glucose. Only if plasma glucose concentration exceeds this maximum, glucose will appear in the urine. Glomerular filtration (Option D) This process involves the filtering of blood by the kidneys. While important, it does not specifically account for glucose appearing in the urine at lower plasma levels.",

      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: B) Exceeded renal threshold of glucose. Explanation: The presence of glucose in urine in a patient with diabetes is due to exceeding the renal threshold of glucose. When plasma glucose is normal, all the filtered glucose is reabsorbed, but when plasma glucose levels ↑ are high, filtered glucose leads to the tubular load and appears in the urine. For example, when the plasma glucose concentration is 100 mg/dL, the filtered glucose load is at the normal level of 125 mg/min, and no glucose is present in the urine. However, when the plasma glucose concentration increases to 200 mg/dL, the filtered load rises to approximately 250 mg/min, and a small amount of glucose starts to appear in the urine. Decreased tubular secretion of glucose ( Option A): Glucose is reabsorbed but not secreted into the tubules. Increased insulin sensitivity ( Option C): leads to decreased blood glucose levels but does not affect glucose levels in urine. Increased tubular reabsorption of glucose ( Option D): leads to decreased glucose excretion.",

      "correct_answer": "D",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: D) Liddle's syndrome Explanation: Liddle's syndrome is characterised by hypertension and metabolic alkalosis, which are due to a mutation of ENaC (Epithelial Sodium Channel) present in the distal and collecting tubules. This rare autosomal dominant disorder causes excessive ENaC activity, resulting in increased sodium and water reabsorption. Patients experience sodium retention, decreased renin secretion, and reduced levels of Angiotensin II, which subsequently decreases aldosterone secretion. Treatment: Amiloride (Blocks excessive ENaC activity). Option A: Gordon’s syndrome: This condition is caused by mutations in the WNK1 and WNK4 genes and typically presents with hyperkalemia and metabolic acidosis. Option B: Barttin syndrome: This syndrome results from mutations affecting the sodium-potassium-chloride cotransporter, potassium channels in the luminal membrane, and chloride channels in the basolateral membrane of the thick ascending loop of Henle. Patients present with hypokalemia and metabolic alkalosis. Option C: Gitelman’s syndrome: It arises from a mutation in the thiazide-sensitive sodium-chloride cotransporter in the distal tubule.

Descending limb of Loop of Henle: In the descending limb, the permeability to water allows for the passive reabsorption of water into the hypertonic medullary interstitium. This segment is impermeable to solutes such as sodium and chloride but permeable to water. As the filtrate descends into the medulla, where the interstitial osmolality is very high (up to 1200-1400 mOsm/kg), water moves out of the descending limb due to osmosis. This results in the filtrate becoming more concentrated (hypertonic) compared to plasma as it progresses through the descending limb.

      "explanation": "Correct Answer: D) Hydrogen Ions Hydrogen ions (H+) are actively secreted into the tubular lumen in the PCT (Not Reabsorbed) Proximal Convoluted Tubule: PCT plays a crucial role in renal function by reabsorbing approximately 65% of filtered sodium, chloride, potassium and bicarbonate, along with almost all filtered glucose and amino acids. Isotonic Absorption Passive reabsorption of Calcium (65%) Sodium Resorption: Occurs through various Carrier Proteins SGLT (5%): Secondary Active Transporter of Sodium and Glucose Co-Transporters (45%): It reabsorbs sodium along with other substances like Amino acids (Sodium-amino acid co-transporter) Phosphate (Sodium-phosphate co-transporter) Citric acid (Sodium-citric acid co-transporter) Sodium Hydrogen Exchanger (45%) IIIIIII IIIIIII Antiporter. It provides H+ ions and aids in the absorption of Bicarbonate Na/K ATPase is present on the Basolateral side, which creates the gradient for Sodium. Sodium Bi-Carbonate Co-transporter (NBC): Helps in Na reabsorption in the basolateral membrane. Proximal Tubule has two parts: Proximal Convoluted Tubule (PCT): It is a little impermeable for chloride reabsorption, leading to a higher concentration of chloride in the Proximal convoluted tubule. Proximal Straight Tubule (PST): Na+ is reabsorbed along with chloride.",

      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: C) Glomerulo-tubular balance Glomerulo-tubular balance is the process by which the proximal tubule adjusts sodium reabsorption in response to changes in glomerular filtration rate (GFR). This ensures a constant percentage of sodium is reabsorbed despite variations in GFR. Peritubular capillaries play a crucial role in reabsorbing substances from the renal tubules back into the bloodstream. These capillaries will proportionately reabsorb whatever is reabsorbed at the proximal tubule, thus depleting the Sodium in the interstitium. This process is governed by Starling forces, which involve hydrostatic pressure (P) and oncotic pressure ( π ). Hydrostatic Pressure (P) : This is the pressure exerted by fluid within the capillary. In peritubular capillaries, a low hydrostatic pressure helps facilitate the reabsorption of water and solutes (like sodium) from the tubular lumen into the capillary. Oncotic Pressure ( π ) : This is the osmotic pressure exerted by proteins, mainly albumin, in the blood plasma. High oncotic pressure in the peritubular capillaries helps retain water and solutes within the capillary, preventing excessive loss into the interstitial space. Renal Autoregulation(Option A) refers to the kidney’s ability to maintain stable renal blood flow and GFR despite changes in systemic blood pressure. Modulating GFR based on feedback from sodium concentrations(Option B) Tubuloglomerular feedback is a mechanism where the macula densa cells in the distal tubule monitor sodium chloride levels and regulate afferent arteriolar resistance to control GFR. Renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) regulating sodium reabsorption(Option D) The RAAS system is vital for regulating sodium and water balance in response to changes in blood pressure and blood volume by acting on distal nephron segments (e.g., distal convoluted tubule, collecting duct) to enhance sodium reabsorption.",

      "explanation": "Correct Answer: B) End of the collecting duct Explanation: Without ADH, the collecting ducts cannot effectively reabsorb water, resulting in diluted urine with low osmolality despite high plasma osmolality. Therefore, the minimum urine tonicity is at the end of the collecting duct, where water reabsorption is impaired due to the lack of ADH.
