        "D": "Low TSH, low T4 levels"
      },
      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: A) Elevated TSH, low T4 levels Explanation: The characteristic laboratory findings in primary hypothyroidism are elevated thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) levels and l ow free thyroxine (T4) levels. This is because, in primary hypothyroidism , the thyroid gland fails to produce sufficient thyroid hormones, leading to decreased feedback inhibition of the pituitary gland, which in turn increases TSH production to try to stimulate the thyroid gland. Primary vs Secondary Hypothyroidism: Feature Primary Hypothyroidism Secondary Hypothyroidism Definition Thyroid gland dysfunction leads to inadequate thyroid hormone production Pituitary dysfunction leads to insufficient TSH secretion Causes Autoimmune (Hashimoto's thyroiditis) Iatrogenic (e.g., post-thyroidectomy, radiation) Iodine deficiency Medications (e.g., amiodarone, lithium) Infiltrative diseases (e.g., sarcoidosis) Food goitrogen → Cabbage, cassava. Pituitary tumors Pituitary surgery or radiation Sheehan’s syndrome Trauma Genetic pituitary hormone deficiencies Non-obstetric cause of pituitary damage called Simmonds's disease (AVM, tumor, HTN) Sarcoidosis Hemochromatosis Lab TSH - ↑ ; Free T3/T4 - ↓ TSH - Normal or ↓ ; Free T3/T4 - ↓ (Option D) Clinical Features Fatigue, weight gain, cold intolerance Dry skin, hair loss Bradycardia, constipation Myxedema (puffy face, non-pitting edema) Similar to primary hypothyroidism Other pituitary hormone deficiencies (e.g., low cortisol, low LH/FSH) Treatment Levothyroxine (T4) replacement with dosage based on TSH levels Levothyroxine (T4) replacement, but monitored by free T4 levels (since TSH is unreliable) Elevated TSH, low T3 levels (Option B): While low T3 levels can occur in primary hypothyroidism, T4 levels are more commonly measured and are more indicative of thyroid function. Low T3 alone is not specific enough to diagnose primary hypothyroidism without considering T4 levels I Elevated TSH, elevated T4 levels (Option C): This combination is not characteristic of primary hypothyroidism. Elevated TSH with elevated T4 levels might indicate resistance to thyroid hormone or a rare TSH-secreting pituitary adenoma, but not primary hypothyroidism Reference: Harrison’s Principles of Internal Medicine, Volume I, Page. 2933",

      "question": "Which of the following hormones use receptor tyrosine kinase signalling?",
      "options": {
        "A": "Insulin",
        "B": "TSH",
        "C": "TRH",
        "D": "MSH"
      },
      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "receptors located on cell membranes. Pass through the membrane once; the hormone-binding site is extracellular, and the catalytic site is intracellular. Mechanism of Action: Hormone Binding: Hormone binds to the extracellular part of the RTK. Enzyme Activation: Binding activates or inactivates an intracellular enzyme. Some RTKs have intrinsic enzymatic activity, while others depend on associated enzymes. Example: Leptin Receptor Family: Cytokine receptors. Hormone: Leptin (regulates appetite and energy balance). Associated Enzyme: JAK2 (Janus kinase family). Signaling Process: Dimerization: Leptin binding causes receptor dimerization. Phosphorylation & Conformation Change: Leptin binding alters receptor conformation, phosphorylating the intracellular part of the JAK receptor. Intracellular Signaling: Activated JAK2 phosphorylates tyrosine residues within the receptor-JAK2 complex, activating STAT proteins, which leads to target gene activation and protein synthesis. JAK2 also activates additional pathways, including MAPK and PI3K. Effects: Rapid: Due to activation of the above-said intracellular enzymes. Slower: Requires new protein synthesis. Hormones Utilising Receptor Tyrosine Kinase Signalling: Fibroblast Growth Factor Growth Hormone Hepatocyte Growth Factor Insulin (Option A) Insulin-like Growth Factor-1 Leptin Prolactin Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor TSH (Option B), TRH (Option C), and MSH (Option D): Belong to the family of G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) and signal through G-protein-mediated pathways. TSH acts on the thyroid gland to stimulate the production and release of thyroid hormones, while TRH regulates TSH release from the pituitary gland. It is a peptide hormone that regulates pigmentation and is primarily involved in the activation of melanocortin receptors, which are also GPCRs.

      "question": "Among the given options, which condition is expected to exhibit the greatest levels of ACTH and cortisol?",
      "options": {
        "A": "Early morning",
        "B": "Normal individuals with dexamethasone administration",
        "C": "Addison's disease",
        "D": "Cushing's disease"
      },
      "correct_answer": "D",
      "explanation": "characterized by the overproduction of ACTH by a pituitary tumor (adenoma). This excessive ACTH production leads to increased stimulation of the adrenal glands, causing them to produce and release excessive amounts of cortisol, a stress hormone. Therefore, both ACTH and cortisol levels are elevated in Cushing's disease. Corticosteroid feedback mechanism Circadian rhythm: Diurnal pattern with peak in morning and low in evening, independent of external factors (Option A ruled out) The adrenal cortex atrophies and becomes unresponsive to the ACTH for about six months after a prolonged treatment with steroids. (Option B ruled out) Adrenal insufficiency is precipitated as a result. Addison's disease (Option C): It is characterized by a deficiency of cortisol production due to adrenal insufficiency. In this condition, both ACTH and cortisol levels are decreased. ACTH levels are elevated as a compensatory mechanism to stimulate the adrenal glands, but the adrenal glands are unable to produce sufficient cortisol.
