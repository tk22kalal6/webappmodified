      "question": "The correct sequence of events during vomiting are? 1. Relaxation of lower esophageal sphincter 2. Strong contractions in the stomach 3. Inspiration against a closed glottis 4. Relaxation of the pyloric sphincter 5. Relaxation of upper esophageal sphincter 6. Reverse peristalsis in the small intestine",
      "options": {
        "A": "6,4,2,5,1,3",
        "B": "6,4,3,2,1,5",
        "C": "4,6,2,1,3,5",
        "D": "4,6,2,5,3,1"
      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Small Intestine : Reverse peristalsis pushes intestinal contents back into the stomach, possibly introducing bile into the vomit. Relaxation of Pyloric Sphincter : In severe cases, the pyloric sphincter relaxes, facilitating the expulsion of gastric and duodenal contents. Inspiration Against a Closed Glottis : A deep breath is taken while the glottis remains closed, creating negative pressure in the thoracic cavity. Strong Contractions in the Stomach : Abdominal muscles and diaphragm contract, increasing intragastric pressure, propelling contents upward. Relaxation of Lower Esophageal Sphincter (LES) : LES relaxes, allowing stomach contents to move into the esophagus. Relaxation of Upper Esophageal Sphincter (UES) : UES relaxes, allowing vomitus to exit through the mouth Step Description 1. Relaxation of LES LES relaxes to allow stomach contents to move into the esophagus. 2. Strong Contractions in Stomach Abdominal and diaphragm muscles contract to propel stomach contents upward. 3. Inspiration Against Closed Glottis Deep breath with glottis closed creates negative pressure for expulsion. 4. Relaxation of UES UES relaxes, allowing vomitus to exit the mouth. 5. Reverse Peristalsis in Small Intestine Reverse peristalsis pushes intestinal contents back into the stomach. 6. Relaxation of Pyloric Sphincter In severe vomiting, pyloric sphincter relaxes, aiding in expulsion. Reference: Ganong’s Review of Medical Physiology, 26th Edition, Pg 490",

      "question": "Following complete ileal and partial jejunal resection, the patient is most likely to develop?",
      "options": {
        "A": "Folic acid deficiency",
        "B": "Vitamin B12 deficiency",
        "C": "Iron deficiency",
        "D": "Reduced absorption of carbohydrates"
      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "in the ileum of the small intestine and requires an intrinsic factor for its absorption. Absorption of Vitamins : Type Vitamin Primary Absorption Site Mechanism of Absorption Fat-Soluble A D E K Small intestine (Duodenum, mainly jejunum). Require bile salts for emulsification. Incorporated into mixed micelles. Absorbed by passive diffusion into enterocytes. Packaged into chylomicrons for transport. Water-Soluble B Vitamins Jejunum and Ileum. (B12 specifically in ileum) Various mechanisms include: Active transport Passive diffusion Carrier-mediated transport Sodium-dependent transport B12 requires an intrinsic factor C Sodium-dependent active transport at low concentrations. Passive diffusion at high concentrations. Absorption of Iron: Most dietary iron is ferric (Fe³ I ), and the absorbed form is ferrous (Fe² I ). Fe³ I is reduced to Fe² I by gastric secretions and reductase activity in enterocytes. Iron absorption occurs mainly in the duodenum via divalent metal transporter 1 (DMT1 Absorption of carbohydrates: Maximum absorption occurs in jejunum > duodenum = ileum. No absorption in the colon Reference: Ganong’s Review of Medical Physiology, 26th edition, Page 445, 470, 478",
