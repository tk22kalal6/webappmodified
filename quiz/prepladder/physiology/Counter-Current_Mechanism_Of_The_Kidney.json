      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "incomplete metabolism of carbohydrates (e.g. lactate), fats (e.g. ketones), and proteins (e.g. sulfate, phosphate). In a typical diet, the body excretes about 40% of nonvolatile acids (around 30 mEq/day) through phosphate systems and 60% (approximately 50 mEq/day) through NH4+ excretion. The net production of these fixed acids is about 70 to 100 mmol of H+ per day in an adult. This excludes lactate, as most of the lactate produced is metabolized and not excreted 12,000 to 24,000 mmol: Volatile (Respiratory) Acids(option A) The main volatile acid is carbonic acid (H2CO3), which is more correctly referred to as carbon dioxide (CO2). CO2 is the end-product of the complete oxidation of carbohydrates and fatty acids. Basal CO2 production is typically 12,000 to 13,000 mmol/day. However, actual daily CO2 production is usually higher, often in the range of 12,000 to 24,000 mmol/day, depending on metabolic activity levels.

      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "I , which is released into the bloodstream. Correct answer: B) It generates HCO3 I , which is released into the bloodstream. Explanation: The kidneys filter bicarbonate (HCO3 I ) from the blood. Approximately 85% to 90% of bicarbonate is reabsorbed in the proximal tubule, while only about 10% is reabsorbed in the distal tubules and collecting ducts. When NH4+ is excreted, it is produced from the deamination of amino acids. For each NH4+ ion excreted, one HCO3 I ion is generated and released into the bloodstream, helping to maintain acid-base balance. It directly increases the concentration of HCO3 I in the urine: While NH4+ is excreted in the urine, it does not directly increase the concentration of HCO3- in the urine. Instead, NH4+ excretion is linked to HCO3 I generation in the bloodstream (Option A). It decreases the overall HCO3 I reabsorption in the kidneys: The excretion of NH4+ does not decrease HCO3 I reabsorption; rather, it is part of the mechanism that helps maintain HCO3 I levels in the blood (Option C). It prevents the secretion of H+ in the renal tubules: The presence of NH4+ does not prevent the secretion of H+ ions. In fact, H+ ions are secreted into the tubular fluid, which is critical for HCO3 I reabsorption (Option D).

      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "I -H I antiporter Correct Answer: B) Na I -H I antiporter Explanation: Mechanism of Bicarbonate Reabsorption Proximal Convoluted Tubule (PCT): Na I -H I Antiporter: The primary mechanism for bicarbonate reabsorption involves the Na I -H I antiporter located on the apical surface of epithelial cells. Carbonic Anhydrase: CA-4 catalyzes the hydration of CO2 to form carbonic acid (H2CO3), which dissociates into H I and HCO3-.This reaction occurs at the brush border of proximal tubular cells. CA Traps CO2 in the tubular fluid, preventing its complete removal. Facilitates the secretion of H I into the tubular lumen while retaining bicarbonate within the cell. Higher permeability to H I and HCO3 I leads to a tubular fluid pH of approximately 6.5. Bicarbonate ions diffuse into the interstitium, similar to K I ions. Na+ and K+ Exchange: Na I -K I ATPase pump is located in the basolateral membrane. Na I enters the interstitium in exchange for K I via the Na I -K I ATPase, maintaining K I concentration while decreasing Na I concentration. (Option A) Regulation of Acid-Base Balance Urine acidification in the PCT is dependent on Na I concentration. Parathyroid Hormone (PTH): PTH inhibits the Na I -H I exchanger in the PCT, affecting urine pH. Carbonic Anhydrase Inhibitors: Drugs that inhibit carbonic anhydrase decrease urine acidification by impairing bicarbonate reabsorption. Cl I -HCO3 I antiporter, also known as Band 3 protein is a Chloride-bicarbonate exchanger at the basolateral membrane of the distal tubules and collecting ducts aids bicarbonate retention and urine acidification (Option C). The H I -ATPase pump is located at the apical surface of the tubular cells of distal tubules and collecting ducts and facilitates ATP-driven transport of H I into the tubular lumen (Option D).",

HCO3- Transport: Into interstitium via Cl I -HCO3 I antiporter. Acidification of Tubular Fluid: Low H+ permeability results in more acidic fluid (pH ~4.5), crucial for urinary buffer excretion. H+ secretion is independent of Na+ concentration. Role of Aldosterone: Enhances acid secretion by increasing proton pump activity. (Option C) Band 3 Protein (Anion Exchanger 1 or AE1): Chloride-bicarbonate exchanger at basolateral membrane aids bicarbonate retention and urine acidification. NH4+ Excretion: H I combines with NH3 to form NH4 I , which is excreted, and essential for acid-base balance. Clinical Implications: Reduced H I secretion decreases net acid excretion and affects HCO3 I buffering of non-volatile acids. Decreases the activity of H I -ATPase (Option A): Aldosterone increases the activity of H I -ATPase but does not decrease it. Inhibits the secretion of H I (Option B): Aldosterone enhances the secretion of H I , not inhibits it.

BUFFERS DESCRIPTION Bicarbonate Buffer Most powerful extracellular buffer system. Composed of H2CO3 and NaHCO3 Buffers strong acids by forming H2CO3 and strong bases by reacting with H+ to form H2O and CO2. Effective due to regulation by kidneys and lungs. Phosphate Buffer Composed of H2PO4 I and HPO4. pK of 6.8, effective in slightly acidic urine. Phosphate concentration increases in tubular fluid due to water reabsorption. Ammonia Buffer Composed of ammonia (NH3) and ammonium ion (NH4 I ). In the liver, Glutamine metabolized to 2NH4 I and 2HCO3 − . NH4 I is secreted into the tubular lumen HCO3 − reabsorbed into blood. Acidosis stimulates NH4 I and HCO3 I formation; alkalosis decreases their formation. The rate of NH4 I excretion can increase significantly with chronic acidosis. Others (less significant) Urate Buffer Citrate Buffer A) Increased sodium concentration: Sodium concentration does not directly trigger the formation of ammonium ions (NH4 I ) and bicarbonate (HCO3 I ) in the ammonia buffer system. Instead, sodium balance is primarily related to the regulation of fluid volume and blood pressure. B) Alkalosis: In contrast, alkalosis decreases the formation of NH4 I and HCO3 I . D) Dehydration: Dehydration primarily affects fluid balance and can lead to an increase in blood osmolarity. While severe dehydration can lead to metabolic disturbances, it does not specifically trigger the formation of NH4 I and HCO3 I in the ammonia buffer system.

While active transport is essential in some segments, such as the thick ascending limb of the loop of Henle, which actively transports Na+ and Cl − , it is not required across all segments of the system. Passive transport and selective permeability are critical components. Parallel and opposite flow of fluids : This is a fundamental requirement for a counter-current mechanism. In the kidneys, the descending and ascending limbs of the loop of Henle and the vasa recta have fluid flows in opposite directions, which maximizes the efficiency of exchange processes (O ption A) Close proximity and selective permeability of pathways: This selective permeability is crucial for the system's function. In the loop of Henle, the descending limb is permeable to water but not solutes, while the ascending limb is impermeable to water but actively transports solutes (Option B) A concentration gradient between inflow and outflow pathways : In the kidneys, the active transport of Na+ and Cl − from the ascending limb of the loop of Henle into the medullary interstitium creates the osmotic gradient that is essential for the counter-current mechanism to function effectively.

A) To dilute urine for better excretion of waste products: The counter-current mechanism aims to concentrate, not dilute, the urine. Dilution would result in a loss of excess water, which could lead to dehydration. B) To conserve sodium and chloride ions in the body: While sodium and chloride reabsorption occurs during the process, the primary goal is not to conserve these ions but to create an osmotic gradient that facilitates water reabsorption. D) To increase blood flow to the renal cortex: The counter-current mechanism primarily operates in the renal medulla and focuses on concentrating urine rather than regulating blood flow to the renal cortex.

The counter-current multiplier specifically refers to the mechanisms occurring within the loop of Henle and associated structures in the medulla, not the cortical regions. COUNTERCURRENT MULTIPLIER Site Function Proximal Tubule Delivers an isosmotic filtrate to the loop of Henle, with approximately 65% of filtered electrolytes and water reabsorbed. The osmolarity here is around 300 mOsm/L, similar to plasma. Thin Descending Limb of the Loop of Henle Highly permeable to water due to the presence of aquaporin-1 (AQP-1) channels and mildly permeable to solutes like urea and sodium chloride. As the filtrate moves deeper into the hyperosmotic medulla, water exits by osmosis, concentrating the tubular fluid. Thin Ascending Limb of the Loop of Henle Impermeable to water but permeable to solutes. NaCl passively diffuses out, and some urea enters, contributing to medullary hyperosmolarity. (Option C) Thick Ascending Limb of the Loop of Henle (TAL) Impermeable to water and urea, actively transports NaCl, K I out of the tubule into the interstitium using the Na+-K+-2Cl- cotransporter.
