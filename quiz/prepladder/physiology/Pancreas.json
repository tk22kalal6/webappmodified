      },
      "correct_answer": "D",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: D) Consumption of a large carbohydrate meal Explanation: Eating a meal rich in carbohydrates significantly increases insulin secretion to promote the storage of glucose as glycogen, thus resulting in a high I/G ratio. Prolonged fasting (Option A) decreases insulin levels while increasing glucagon secretion to mobilize stored energy, resulting in a low I/G ratio. A low-carbohydrate diet (Option B) reduces insulin levels and increases glucagon secretion to maintain blood glucose levels, leading to a lower I/G ratio. During starvation (Option C) , the body relies heavily on glucagon to mobilize energy stores, resulting in a very low I/G ratio.

      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: A) Stimulating glycogen synthesis in the liver Explanation: Glucagon inhibits glycogen synthesis in the liver by inactivating glycogen synthase. It prevents the storage of glucose as glycogen, instead promoting glucose release into the bloodstream. Promoting gluconeogenesis (Option B): Glucagon activates enzymes involved in gluconeogenesis, increasing glucose production from non-carbohydrate sources, such as amino acids. Increasing glycogen breakdown in the liver (Option C): Glucagon stimulates glycogenolysis, breaking down glycogen stores in the liver to increase blood glucose levels. Enhancing lipolysis in the liver (Option D): Glucagon promotes lipolysis, breaking down triglycerides in the liver to free fatty acids and glycerol, which can be used for energy production.

      "explanation": "α -Adrenergic receptor activation Correct Answer: A) α -Adrenergic receptor activation Explanation: Activation of α -adrenergic receptors , typically by norepinephrine during sympathetic stimulation, inhibits insulin secretion. Parasympathetic activation enhances insulin secretion, through the release of acetylcholine, which acts on M3 receptors in pancreatic beta cells. (Option B) Stimulation of β 2-adrenergic receptors in the sympathetic system can promote insulin secretion, especially when the inhibitory effects of α -adrenergic receptors are blocked.

      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "receptors. Correct Answer: C) GLP-1 analogues increase gastric emptying by stimulating specific GLP-1 receptors. Explanation: GLP-1 analogues slow gastric emptying and suppress appetite by activating specific GLP-1 receptors. ORAL HYPOGLYCEMIC DRUGS Sulphonylureas (Option B) Mechanism of action: Sulfonylureas bind to the sulfonylurea receptor (SUR1) on the membrane of pancreatic β -cells, which stimulates insulin secretion regardless of glucose concentration. This results in a significant and often unregulated release of insulin, potentially leading to severe hypoglycemia, especially at low glucose levels. Examples: Tolbutamide, Glipizide, Glibenclamide. GLP-1 Analogues (Option A) Mechanism of Action : GLP-1 analogues activate GLP-1 receptors, which are GPCRs located on pancreatic β -cells, α -cells, central and peripheral neurons, and gastrointestinal mucosa. This activation promotes insulin secretion specifically in response to high glucose levels, inhibits glucagon release, slows gastric emptying, and suppresses appetite. GLP-1 analogues also contribute to pancreatic β -cell health by reducing islet cell apoptosis. Examples : Exenatide, Liraglutide. DPP-4 Inhibitors (Option D) Mechanism of Action : DPP-4 inhibitors block the enzyme DPP-4, which normally breaks down endogenous GLP-1. By inhibiting this enzyme, these drugs increase the levels of GLP-1, thereby enhancing insulin secretion indirectly and improving glycemic control. Examples : Sitagliptin, Saxagliptin, Vildagliptin.

      "explanation": "ATP-sensitive K+ channels, causing Ca2+ influx and insulin release. Correct Answer: B) Glucose is metabolized to pyruvate, increasing ATP, which inhibits ATP-sensitive K+ channels, causing Ca2+ influx and insulin release. Explanation: Glucose metabolism produces ATP, which inhibits ATP-sensitive K+ channels. This inhibition leads to depolarization of the β -cell membrane, causing Ca2+ influx through voltage-gated channels, and triggering insulin release. Insulin secretion is regulated through a biphasic response to plasma glucose levels. Biphasic response of Insulin secretion First Rapid Phase Second Prolonged Phase Glucose enters pancreatic β -cells via GLUT-2 transporters. Inside the cell, glucose is phosphorylated by glucokinase and converted to pyruvate. Pyruvate is metabolized in the mitochondria, producing ATP. (Option D) Increased ATP inhibits ATP-sensitive K+ channels, leading to reduced K+ efflux. This depolarizes the β -cell membrane, causing voltage-gated Ca2+ channels to open. Ca2+ influx triggers the exocytosis of a pool of insulin-containing granules, Results in a rapid, short-lived increase in insulin secretion. Peak within 1–2 minutes and then decreases to basal level in another 2 to 3 minutes Pyruvate metabolism increases intracellular glutamate levels. (Option C) Glutamate acts as an intracellular second messenger, priming a second pool of secretory granules for release. It may also lower the pH in granules, aiding in their maturation. This leads to a prolonged phase of insulin secretion . Peak in about 60 minutes and then remain elevated for 3–5 hours.

Hypothyroidism: Causes: Iodine deficiency : Inadequate iodine intake inhibits thyroid hormone synthesis, leading to decreased secretion and compensatory thyroid hypertrophy eg. goiter. Autoimmune destruction : eg. Hashimoto thyroiditis (Option D) involves antibodies and immune cells attacking the thyroid gland, causing hypothyroidism. Pituitary or hypothalamic failure : Disruptions in the pituitary gland or hypothalamus → ↓ TSH or TRH → ↓ thyroid stimulation. Drug-induced hypothyroidism : eg. Amiodarone, Lithium Wolff-Chaikoff Effect: A mild and transient inhibition of iodide organic binding and hormone synthesis caused by large doses of iodide acting directly on the thyroid gland in healthy individuals. Clinical features: Reduced cognitive function, fatigue, lethargy. Cold intolerance Weight gain despite poor appetite Dry, yellowish skin (carotenemia) and puffiness (myxedema) due to protein complex accumulation. Constipation: Slowed digestive processes. Thinning hair on the scalp and/or other areas. Treatment: Addressing underlying causes: Iodine supplementation, hormone replacement therapy, and medication adjustments. Levothyroxine : Synthetic T4 administered to replace deficient thyroid hormone. (Option C) Hyperthyroidism: Causes: Graves disease : Autoimmune condition where antibodies stimulate the TSH receptor, leading to excessive T4 and T3 secretion and goiter. Toxic adenoma or multinodular goiter : Benign thyroid nodules autonomously produce thyroid hormones. Early stages of Hashimoto thyroiditis : Initial inflammation can cause a transient phase of hyperthyroidism. TSH-secreting pituitary tumor : Rare tumors secrete excessive TSH, overstimulating the thyroid gland. Symptoms: Nervousness and irritability: Increased CNS stimulation. Weight loss: Despite increased appetite (hyperphagia), elevated metabolism causes weight loss. Rapid heartbeat (tachycardia) and palpitations: Thyroid hormones stimulate cardiac function. Tremor: Fine tremor of the outstretched fingers. Eye changes: Protruding eyeballs (exophthalmos) in Graves disease. Treatment: Antithyroid medications : Thioureylenes like propylthiouracil (Option A) and methimazole inhibit thyroid hormone synthesis. Radioactive iodine therapy : Destroys thyroid tissue, reducing hormone production. Surgery : Removal of the thyroid gland, especially if the goiter is large and causing compressive symptoms.",

They increase BMR in every tissue except the anterior pituitary, brain, gonads, spleen, and lymph nodes. Functions of thyroid hormones: Effect of Thyroid hormone on metabolism Carbohydrate Metabolism Increase absorption of glucose from the intestine. Induce hepatic gluconeogenesis and glycogenolysis, raising plasma glucose. Increase glucose turnover by enhancing its uptake and oxidation. (Option B) Fat Metabolism Stimulate lipolysis, releasing free fatty acids and glycerol. Increase lipid turnover and facilitate oxidation. Stimulate cholesterol synthesis, oxidation, and biliary excretion. Enhance hepatic uptake of cholesterol by increasing LDL receptor expression. Net effect: a significant decrease in plasma cholesterol and total lipid levels. Protein metabolism (Option D) Promote proteolysis in skeletal muscle, releasing amino acids. Increase protein turnover by enhancing protein degradation. Effects of Thyroid Hormone on CVS Heart Rate and Cardiac Output Increase the heart rate by upregulating and sensitizing β -receptors in the SA and AV nodes, leading to tachycardia in hyperthyroidism. Enhance myocardial contractility by increasing stroke volume hence increasing cardiac output (CO). Blood Pressure Systolic blood pressure : I heart rate and stroke volume results in increased CO Diastolic pressure: decreases due to calorigenic-induced thermogenic cutaneous vasodilation, resulting in decreased peripheral resistance. The overall effect is an increased pulse pressure, which is prominent in hyperthyroidism. Circulation Dynamics Enhanced cardiac output and vasodilation create hyperdynamic circulation, leading to shortened circulation time. Effects of Thyroid Hormone on other systems: Target system Functions CNS Important for the maturation of CNS especially during infancy and childhood Essential for overall brain functions including memory, learning, alertness, and reflexes. Lack of thyroid hormones during infancy can cause irreversible CNS development retardation. Skeletal muscle Thyroid hormones increase MHC gene expression in skeletal muscle, leading to muscle cramps and weakness in hypothyroidism. Hyperthyroidism also causes muscle weakness due to increased protein catabolism, with chronic cases resulting in thyrotoxic myopathy. Bones It is essential for normal growth, and musculoskeletal maturation, and promotes the expression of growth hormone (GH) genes. Increase",

      },
      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: C) Increased activity of 5-deiodinase Explanation: Increased activity of 5-deiodinase leads to increased conversion of T4 to RT3 by 5-deiodinase leading to higher levels of the physiologically inert RT3 and lower levels of the active T3 Peripheral conversion of T4 to T3 The peripheral conversion of T4 to T3 is a crucial process that regulates the active thyroid hormone T3 levels, ensuring its availability to target cells. The major product secreted by the thyroid gland is thyroxine (T4) Conversion to T3 35% of secreted T4 is converted to T3 in the circulation by the enzyme 5'-deiodinase, mainly found in the liver and kidneys. This process produces about 85% of circulating T3, the most active hormone that primarily affects target cells. Conversion to RT3 45% of T4 is also converted to reverse T3 (RT3) by the enzyme 5-deiodinase. RT3 is physiologically inert and accounts for 95% of circulating RT3. The remaining 20% of T4 is conjugated with sulfates and glucuronides. Deiodinase Deiodinases are enzymes responsible for the metabolism of thyroid hormones. They play a crucial role in regulating the levels of active thyroid hormones in various tissues. All deiodinases contain selenocysteine, an amino acid essential for their enzyme activity, making them potent catalysts for oxidoreductive reactions. There are three types of deiodinases: Type of deiodinase Location Function D1 Liver Kidney Thyroid Pituitary Function as 5´-deiodinases, converting thyroxine (T4) to triiodothyronine (T3) Maintaining intracellular T3 levels in target tissues D2 Skeletal muscle Brain Pituitary Placenta Brown fat Its function is the same as D1 It maintains a steady supply of T3 to neurons in the brain. D3 Brain Reproductive tissue Converts T4 to reverse T3 (RT3), a biologically inactive form. Metabolism of T3 and T4: T3 is degraded to diiodothyronines in the liver and kidney. In the liver, T4 and T3 undergo conjugation with sulfates and glucuronic acid, which are then secreted in bile and re-enter the enterohepatic circulation, minimizing iodine loss. T4 is also metabolized to tetraiodoacetic acid (tetrac) in various tissues. Increased activity of 5´-deiodinase (Option A) would lead to higher levels of T3, not lower, which contradicts the patient's lab findings. Decreased activity of 5-deiodinase (Option B) would result in reduced levels of RT3, not elevated levels as seen in the patient. The patient has normal T4 levels, indicating that thyroxine secretion is not the issue. (Option D) Reference: GK Pal Comprehensive Textbook of Medical Physiology, 1st Edition, Page 486-487",

      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "equilibrium Correct Answer: C) A temporary fall in free thyroid hormones stimulates TSH secretion, restoring equilibrium Explanation: TBG levels are increased in pregnancy which binds to the thyroid hormone and reduces the levels of free thyroid hormone in the blood, this temporary fall in thyroid hormone stimulates TSH secretion, thereby restoring equilibrium. Consequences of Increased TBG Due to Pregnancy TBG Elevation During Pregnancy : TBG levels are elevated in estrogen-treated patients and during pregnancy, necessitating the above compensatory mechanisms to maintain thyroid hormone balance. Initial Impact : Decrease in Free Thyroid Hormones : A sudden, sustained increase in thyroid-binding proteins like TBG in the plasma causes a temporary fall in the concentration of free thyroid hormones Increased TBG levels do bind more thyroid hormones, reducing the levels of free hormones temporarily. Overall binding capacity increases, but it does not necessarily compensate by decreasing the metabolic clearance rate significantly. The primary compensatory mechanism is the increased TSH secretion, which restores free hormone levels. (Option D) Feedback Mechanism : TSH Secretion: The drop in free thyroid hormones stimulates the secretion of Thyroid Stimulating Hormone (TSH). (Option A) Increased Production: TSH increases the production of free thyroid hormones. New Equilibrium: A new equilibrium is reached where the total quantity of thyroid hormones in the blood is elevated (Option B) , but the concentration of free hormones, their metabolism rate, and the TSH secretion rate return to normal. Euthyroid State: Despite the increased total thyroid hormone levels, patients remain euthyroid, meaning they are neither hyperthyroid nor hypothyroid.

Binding Capacity: Each TBG molecule has a single binding site for thyroid hormones. Binding Proportion : About 70% of T4 and 45% of T3 bind to TBG. Plasma Level Influences: Increase: During pregnancy and in patients receiving estrogen, major tranquilizers, and clofibrate. Decrease: In patients receiving glucocorticoids, androgens, danazol, L-asparaginase, salicylates, phenytoin, mitotane, and 5-fluorouracil (Option A, B, C) Thyroxine Binding Prealbumin (TBPA) /Transthyretin Nature: A globulin, not an albumin, recently designated as transthyretin. Binding Proportion: T3: Less than 1% binds to TBPA. T4: About 20% binds to TBPA. Albumin Binding Proportion: T3: About 55% binds to albumin. T4: About 10% binds to albumin. Importance of Protein Binding Reservoir Function: Protein-bound forms of T3 and T4 serve as a reservoir, replenishing circulating hormones when secretion decreases or metabolism increases temporarily. Protection Against Degradation: Protein binding protects the hormones against metabolic degradation, extending their half-lives (1 day for T3 and 7 days for T4). Regulation of Hormone Secretion: Free-form concentrations provide feedback effects on hormone regulation. Changes in plasma protein levels temporarily affect thyroid hormone levels, maintaining a euthyroid state despite alterations in binding protein levels.

      "question": "A patient with a history of Graves' disease is treated with a high dose of iodide. Initially, there is a reduction in thyroid hormone synthesis due to the Wolff-Chaikoff effect.

        "D": "Increased conversion of T4 to T3 in peripheral tissues"
      },
      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: C) Downregulation of the sodium-iodide symporter (NIS) Explanation: Downregulation of the sodium-iodide symporter (NIS) reduces the intrathyroidal concentration of iodide, allowing normal thyroid hormone synthesis to resume despite high serum iodide levels. Wolff-Chaikoff Effect The Wolff-Chaikoff effect describes the thyroid's response to high doses of iodide, resulting in temporary inhibition of thyroid hormone synthesis. Mechanism: Inhibition of Organic Binding: Large doses of iodide inhibit the organic binding of iodide within the thyroid gland, reducing hormone synthesis. TSH Effect Inhibition: High iodide levels decrease cAMP production in thyroid cells, inhibiting the effect of thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH). (Wolff-Chaikoff effect) This reduces the proteolysis of thyroglobulin, further decreasing hormone synthesis. Purpose The Wolff-Chaikoff effect serves to prevent the thyroid from synthesizing excessive amounts of thyroid hormones in the presence of large quantities of iodide. Thyroid Escape Phenomenon: The Wolff-Chaikoff effect is transient and lasts for only a few days. After the acute phase, the thyroid gland resumes normal hormone synthesis through the escape phenomenon. This is achieved by: Down-regulation of NIS: The sodium iodide symporter (NIS) is down-regulated, reducing intrathyroidal inorganic iodine concentration. Resumption of TPO-H2O2 System: Normal activity of the thyroid peroxidase (TPO) and hydrogen peroxide system resumes, allowing the normal synthesis of thyroxine (T4) and triiodothyronine (T3). Increased degradation of thyroglobulin (Option A) does not explain the escape phenomenon Upregulation of the sodium-iodide symporter (NIS) (Option B) would increase iodide uptake, which is contrary to the escape mechanism. Increased conversion of T4 to T3 (Option C) in peripheral tissues is unrelated to the escape phenomenon in the context of thyroid hormone synthesis regulation.

      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: C) Iodide trapping Explanation: Iodide trapping involves the active transport of iodide into the thyroid follicular cells via the sodium-iodide symporter (NIS) and is not facilitated by thyroid peroxidase. Thyroid Hormone Synthesis 1. Iodide Trapping Mechanism: Iodide is actively transported into thyroid follicles (iodide pump). Process: Na+ and I I co-transported into the cell by Na+-I I symporter (NIS).TSH induces expression and retention of NIS. Na+ is pumped out by the Na+-K+ pump. Iodide is pumped against electrical and chemical gradients using ATP. Other Tissues: Salivary glands, placenta, choroid plexus, mammary gland, gastric mucosa, and ciliary body also accumulate iodide but do not form thyroid hormones. Iodide trapping is stimulated by TSH. 2. Conversion of Iodide into Iodine Process: Iodide is converted to iodine by oxidation. Oxidation (organification) facilitated by thyroid peroxidase. (Option A) 3. Thyroglobulin Synthesis Thyroglobulin: Glycoprotein with two subunits and 123 tyrosine residues. Synthesis: Synthesized in the endoplasmic reticulum of thyroid cells. Packaged in Golgi apparatus and secreted into colloid by exocytosis. Facilitated by thyroid peroxidase. (Option D) Binding: Reactive iodine binds to tyrosine on thyroglobulin, forming monoiodotyrosine (MIT) and diiodotyrosine (DIT). 4. The Coupling Reaction Formation: Two DIT molecules condense to form thyroxine (T4). MIT and DIT condense to form triiodothyronine (T3). Reverse-T3 (RT3) formed by condensation of DIT with MIT. Mechanism: Intramolecular coupling (both DIT attached to thyroglobulin). Intermolecular coupling (DIT detached from thyroglobulin). Facilitation: Coupling reaction facilitated by thyroid peroxidase ( Option B) . 5. Proteolysis of Thyroglobulin Process: Colloid ingested by thyroid cells via endocytosis. Lysosomal enzymes digest peptide bonds in thyroglobulin. Free T4, T3, DIT, and MIT formed in the cytoplasm. Iodotyrosine deiodinase deiodinates MIT and DIT. T3 and T4 are released into circulation. Iodine from deiodination is reutilized by the gland. 6. Secretion of Thyroid Hormones Release: T3 and T4 are secreted into general circulation. MIT and DIT are not secreted by the thyroid gland. Functions of Thyroid Cells: Accumulate iodide from blood. Synthesize and secrete thyroglobulin. Digest colloid and release thyroid hormones.",
