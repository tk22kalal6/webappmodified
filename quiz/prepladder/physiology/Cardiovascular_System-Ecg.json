      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "occlusion. Correct Answer: C) Septal wall myocardial infarction due to Left Anterior Descending (LAD) artery occlusion. Explanation: Leads V1 and V2: ST elevation in these leads is indicative of damage to the septal wall of the left ventricle. Left Anterior Descending (LAD) Artery: The LAD artery supplies the anterior and septal walls of the left ventricle. Therefore, ST elevation in V1 and V2, which view the septal wall, is typically associated with LAD artery occlusion. ST Elevation Location Affected Cardiac Wall Coronary Artery I, aVL, V5, V6 Lateral Wall of the Left Ventricle Left Circumflex (LCX) or Left Anterior Descending (LAD) II, III, aVF Inferior Wall of the Left Ventricle Right Coronary Artery (RCA) V1, V2 Septal Wall of the Left Ventricle Left Anterior Descending (LAD) V3, V4 Anterior Wall of the Left Ventricle Left Anterior Descending (LAD) V1 to V4 Anterior Wall including Septal Left Anterior Descending (LAD) V7, V8, V9 Posterior Wall of the Left Ventricle Right Coronary Artery (RCA) or Left Circumflex (LCX) ST elevation in leads V1 and V2 is not associated with the anterior wall but with the septal wall. RCA occlusion is more likely to cause inferior wall damage ( Option A) Although LAD artery occlusion is involved, V1 and V2 are indicative of septal, not inferior, wall damage. Inferior wall damage is associated with leads II, III, and aVF ( Option B) Lateral wall myocardial infarction is associated with ST elevation in leads I, aVL, V5, and V6, not V1 and V2. LCX occlusion is involved in lateral wall damage ( Option D) Reference: www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK537228/ www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK553168/ www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK540996/ www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK562234/#:~:text=Anterior%20wall%20myocardial%20infarction%20 pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29262146/#:~:text=Inferior%20wall%20myocardial%20infarction%20",

      },
      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: A) Duration: 0.16 seconds, Amplitude: 0.3 mV Explanation: Duration Calculation: Each small box on the ECG paper represents 0.04 seconds. If the T wave spans 4 small boxes, the duration of the T wave is: 4 x 0.04= 0.16 sec Amplitude Calculation: Each small box represents 0.1 mV. If the T wave spans 3 small boxes in height, the amplitude is: 3 x 0.1 = 0.3 mV Paper Speed: The standard paper speed is 25 mm/second. This means that the ECG paper moves at a rate of 25 millimeters per second. Measurement for Duration: The ECG paper is divided into small and large boxes. Each large box is 5 mm x 5 mm, and each small box within a large box is 1 mm x 1 mm. 1 Large Box: Represents 0.20 seconds (200 milliseconds). 1 Small Box: Represents 0.04 seconds (40 milliseconds) Amplitude: The amplitude of the ECG waveforms is measured in millivolts (mV). Each vertical small box represents 0.1 mV. Each large box represents 0.5 mV (since it contains 5 small boxes). Although the duration is correct, the amplitude given is for a different number of boxes ( Option B) The duration calculation is correct, but the amplitude is not accurate for the given number of boxes ( Option C) The amplitude is correct, but the duration provided is for a different number of boxes ( Option D) Reference: Guyton & Hall Textbook of Medical Physiology, Edition 14, Page 137",

Determine the net deflection (positive or negative) of the QRS complex in Lead I and aVF. Place the axis in the appropriate quadrant based on the signs: Lead I (+) and aVF (+): Normal axis Lead I (-) and aVF (+): Right axis deviation Lead I (-) and aVF (-): Extreme right axis deviation Lead I (+) and aVF (-): Left axis deviation Einthoven Triangle Method: Uses the net deflections in Leads I, II, and III to calculate the axis. Calculate the net QRS deflection for each of the three limb leads. Use vector addition to combine these deflections. Calculate the resultant vector and determine its angle. Graphical Method: Involves plotting the QRS vectors on a graph to find the axis. Measure the net deflection of the QRS complex in at least two leads. Plot these values on a coordinate system. Use vector addition to determine the overall direction of the QRS vector. Inspection of the Isoelectric Lead with Hexaxial system: Identifies the isoelectric lead (lead with the smallest net QRS deflection). Find the lead with the most isoelectric QRS complex. The QRS axis is perpendicular to this lead. Use adjacent leads to refine the exact axis using hexaxial system.

The electrode records the HBE. Waveforms in the His Bundle Electrogram A Wave (Option A) The A wave represents atrial depolarization. H Wave (Option C) The H wave represents depolarization of the His bundleâ€™s upper part. V Wave: (Option B) The V wave represents ventricular depolarization. Intervals in the His Bundle Electrogram P-A Interval The PA interval is the time from the onset of the P wave on the surface ECG to the onset of the A wave on the His bundle electrogram. The PA interval typically ranges from 25 to 55 milliseconds. A-H Interval The A-H interval is the time between the onset of the A wave and the onset of the H wave. Typically ranges from 50 to 120 milliseconds. This interval represents conduction time through the AV node. A prolonged A-H interval suggests AV nodal conduction delay. H-V Interval Typically ranges from 35 to 55 milliseconds. This interval represents conduction time through the His-Purkinje system. A prolonged H-V interval suggests an infranodal conduction delay or block.",
