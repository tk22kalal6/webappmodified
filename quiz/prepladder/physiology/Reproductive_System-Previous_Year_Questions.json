      "question": "During spermatogenesis, which of the following hormones inhibits Follicle-Stimulating Hormone (FSH) secretion?",
      "options": {
        "A": "Testosterone",
        "B": "Inhibin",
        "C": "Luteinizing Hormone (LH)",
        "D": "Androgen"
      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Hormone (FSH) secretion during spermatogenesis . Function of Sertoli cells: Only Sertoli cells form the blood-testis barrier Nourishment and protection to developing sperm cells. Sertoli cells contain receptors for FSH (follicle-stimulating hormone) and androgens, which indirectly support spermatogenesis. Sertoli cells produce androgen-binding protein (ABP). Sertoli cells express the aromatase enzyme, responsible for converting testosterone to estrogen. They produce extracellular matrix components and anti-Müllerian hormone (AMH/MIS), which induces regression of Müllerian ducts during male fetal development. Sertoli cells secrete Inhibin B , a crucial factor in the testes that negatively regulates (decreases) FSH secretion through feedback mechanisms. Testosterone (Option A) is incorrect because testosterone primarily inhibits LH secretion by acting on the hypothalamus and pituitary . However, it does not directly inhibit FSH. Luteinizing Hormone (LH) (Option C) is incorrect because LH stimulates Leydig cells to produce testosterone , but it does not inhibit FSH secretion. Androgen (Option D) is incorrect because androgens (like testosterone) primarily regulate LH via negative feedback, not FSH directly.

      },
      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Bulbospongiosus relaxation Correct Answer: C) Ischiocaveernosus contraction- external urethral sphincter relaxation- Bulbospongiosus relaxation Explanation: Ejaculation is a complex process that occurs in two stages: emission and expulsion . The correct sequence of muscle activity during the expulsion phase is as follows: Ischiocavernosus contraction: The ischiocavernosus muscles contract to maintain penile rigidity by compressing the base of the corpora cavernosa and increasing intracavernosal pressure. External urethral sphincter relaxation: Relaxation of the external urethral sphincter allows semen to flow from the prostatic urethra into the penile urethra. Bulbospongiosus contraction: The bulbospongiosus muscles contract rhythmically to expel semen forcefully from the penile urethra.
