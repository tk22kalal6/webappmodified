Regulation of aldosterone: Renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAS) plays a crucial role in the regulation of aldosterone levels in the plasma. ACTH stimulates aldosterone synthesis and secretion, but the quantity of ACTH required to stimulate aldosterone secretion is more than the concentration required to stimulate cortisol secretion. Physiological Actions of Aldosterone: The main function of aldosterone is to increase Na+ and water reabsorption and to promote K+ and H+ excretion from the kidney (Option A). It acts primarily on P cells (principal cells) of collecting the duct and distal tubule of the kidney to increase the sodium reabsorption. Chlorine is transported in the same direction to maintain electroneutrality due to Na+ reabsorption, causing osmotic reabsorption of water which leads to ECF expansion (Option B) and increases blood pressure (Option D).

Tetany: It is characterized by extensive skeletal muscle spasms Cause: Decrease in extracellular ionized calcium (Ca2+), leading to increased excitability of nerve and muscle cells. Mechanism: Increased Excitability: Reduced extracellular Ca2+ lowers its binding to voltage-gated sodium channels in nerve and muscle cells.
