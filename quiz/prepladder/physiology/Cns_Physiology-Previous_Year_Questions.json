      "question": "A patient reports difficulty switching between movements and experiences uncontrollable hand movements. What is the most likely diagnosis?",

        "C": "Metamorphosis",
        "D": "Resting Tremor"
      },
      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: A) Dysdiadochokinesis Explanation: The term diadochokinesis refers to the ability to perform rapid alternating movements (e.g., pronation/supination of the hands). Difficulty switching between movements suggests dysdiadochokinesis (impaired diadochokinesis) , which is commonly associated with cerebellar dysfunction seen in: Cerebellar ataxia (due to stroke, multiple sclerosis, or degenerative disorders) Parkinson’s disease (along with bradykinesia and rigidity) Clinical Features of Cerebellar Diseases Hypotonia Decreased muscle tone, often on the same side as the cerebellar lesion. Ataxia Uncoordinated movements, often leading to a \"drunken\" gait. Dysdiadochokinesia Inability to perform rapid alternating movements, such as flipping the hands back and forth. Dysmetria (Past pointing) Movements that overshoot or undershoot the intended target. Intention tremor Tremors occurring when moving toward a target Dysarthria Jumbled speech due to lack of coordination in the muscles involved in speech Nystagmus Rapid, tremulous eye movements Rebound Phenomenon Limb jerking back after resistance is suddenly removed Decomposition of movement Can't move multiple joints simultaneously. No sensory deficit Not typically present in cerebellar diseases. Intentional Tremor (Option B) is incorrect because intention tremor (seen in cerebellar lesions) appears during voluntary movement , worsening as the target is approached, rather than causing difficulty in alternating movements. Metamorphosis (Option C) is incorrect because metamorphopsia refers to visual distortions , not movement abnormalities. Resting Tremor (Option D) is incorrect because resting tremor is seen in Parkinson’s disease , occurring at rest and improving with voluntary movement, rather than difficulty in switching movements.

      "explanation": "occurring organic compounds that often have bitter tastes. Various plants produce them as a defence mechanism against herbivores and insects. Many alkaloids are toxic or have pharmacological effects on the human body. Examples of alkaloids: are caffeine, nicotine, morphine, and quinine. Aldehyde (Option A): Aldehydes and ketones have a sweet taste. Most sweet substances are organic. This option is incorrect. Amino acids (Option B): α -amino acids have a sweet taste, but polypeptides are often bitter. This option is incorrect. Hydrogen ions (Option D): Sour taste is triggered by hydrogen ions, the adequate stimulus being a pH of less than 4 of the solution. This option is incorrect.

        "D": "Mid-collicular lesion can lead to decerebrate rigidity"
      },
      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: A) Rigidity occurs in all the muscles of the body Explanation: Decerebrate rigidity primarily affects the extensor muscles of the limbs, leading to the characteristic posture of rigid extension. It does not affect all the muscles of the body equally. According to the Herrington classification, decerebrate rigidity is a form of abnormal muscle tone that occurs due to damage or dysfunction in the medulla resulting in increased activity of motoneurons that facilitate stretch reflexes. Facilitation of stretch reflexes occurs due to two mechanisms: Increased excitability of the motor neuron pool in general. Increased rate of γ motor neuron discharge. Producing a mid-collicular lesion in an experimental animal results in decerebration. Feature Decerebrate Rigidity Decorticate Rigidity Definition A state of severe hypertonia characterized by extension of all four limbs. A state in which the upper extremities are flexed and the lower extremities are extended. Cause Damage to the lower midbrain and upper pons Damage to the upper midbrain Mechanism Loss of descending inhibition to the pontine reticular system causes overactivity of this system, which excites antigravity muscles. Rubrospinal tract excitation of flexor muscles in the upper extremities results in flexion due to damage above the red nucleus. Posture Arms adducted and extended Forearms pronated Wrists and fingers flexed Legs extended Feet plantar flexed Arms adducted and flexed Wrists and fingers flexed Legs extended Plantar flexion of the feet Clinical Significance Severe brain stem damage; poor prognosis Better prognosis than decerebrate rigidity Reference: Ganong’s Review of Medical Physiology, Edition 26, pg no 236-239.",

      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "especially in the Brodmann area 5 and 7. The parietal lobe integrates visual input from the occipital lobe and motor output from the frontal lobe and acts as an association cortex.. It helps process and integrate sensory inputs to guide motor movements and coordinate hand-eye interactions and is the most important area Brodmann Areas: Definition Numbered regions of the cerebral cortex identified by Korbinian Brodmann, based on neuronal structure and arrangement. Linked to sensory processing, motor control, and cognitive functions. Key Brodmann Areas and Functions Brodmann Area Function 1, 2, 3 Primary somatosensory cortex; processes tactile information. 4 Primary motor cortex; controls voluntary movements. 5, 7 Somatosensory association areas; integrate sensory input. 6 Premotor/supplementary motor areas; plan movements. 17 Primary visual cortex; processes visual data. 18, 19 Visual association areas; advanced visual processing. 22 Wernicke's area; facilitates language comprehension. 44, 45 Broca's area; involved in speech production. Frontal lobe (Option B): The frontal lobe is responsible for motor output and is involved in the hand-eye movements, but the parietal lobe is the most important. Temporal lobe (Option C) : The temporal lobe is mainly associated with auditory processing, memory, and language functions, and lesions in this lobe typically do not cause significant impairments in hand-eye coordination. Occipital lobe (Option D): The occipital lobe is primarily responsible for visual processing and is involved in the hand-eye movements, but the parietal lobe is the most important",
