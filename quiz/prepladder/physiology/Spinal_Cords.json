      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: C) Layer IV Explanation: Layer IV is the primary input layer where sensory signals first enter the cortex. It processes these signals and then distributes them to other layers. Cerebral Cortex Layers and Functions: Has six layers of neurons. Layer Function I- Molecular layer Receives nonspecific input signals from lower brain centers. Control the excitability of stimulated areas. II- External granular layer Receives nonspecific input and sends axons to the opposite cortex through the corpus callosum. III- External pyramidal layer Sends axons to related cortical areas on the opposite side through the corpus callosum. IV- Internal granular layer The primary layer for receiving input sensory signals, which then spread to the surface and deeper layers. V- Internal pyramidal layer Sends large axons to distant nervous system parts like basal ganglia, brain stem, and spinal cord. Controls signal transmission. VI- Fusiform/ polymorphic layer Sends axons to the thalamus. Regulates excitability of incoming sensory signals.",

      "explanation": "Correct Answer: A) Dorsal Column-Medial Lemniscal System Explanation: The Dorsal Column-Medial Lemniscal System handles precise touch localization, texture, vibration, and proprioception. The patient’s difficulty with these sensations suggests an issue with this system. Somatosensory pathways: Two primary somatosensory pathways that transmit sensory signals from the body to the brain: the dorsal column-medial lemniscal system and the anterolateral system. Pathway Sensory Modalities Dorsal Column-Medial Lemniscal System (Option A) Touch: Provides precise localization and fine gradations of intensity. Vibration: Detects rapid changes in stimulus through phasic sensations. Proprioception: Contributes to the sense of body position and movement. Pressure: Allows for the perception of fine degrees of pressure intensity. Anterolateral System (Option B & C) Lateral Spinothalamic Tract: Transmits sensations of pain and temperature (warmth and cold). Anterior Spinothalamic Tract: Carries crude touch and pressure for general skin contact, along with tickle, itch, and sexual sensations. Corticospinal Tract is involved in motor control, not sensory discrimination. (Option D) Reference: Guyton and Hall Textbook of Medical Physiology, 14th edition, Page 601",

Cortical structures are capable of reorganization (plasticity) after loss of a body part, neighboring areas take over the cortical area of the lost part. (Option A). Cortical connections of sensory units become weak with disuse and strengthen with use. Phantom Limb Pain Perceived due to cortical plasticity In the phantom limb phenomenon, the limb actually does not exist (amputated), but the patient complains that he feels pain or itch in the limb Based on the evidence, brain reorganization occurs when sensory input is cut off. For example: In leg amputees, the ventral posterior thalamic nucleus can perceive the signal that once received input from leg and foot now responds to stump (thigh) stimulation Management : Epidural Anesthesia: Used during amputation surgery to reduce acute pain and subsequent need for opioids, lowering phantom pain incidence . Spinal Cord Stimulation: Electric current stimulates spinal pathways, reducing phantom limb pain and causing a tingling sensation instead in phantom limb (Option A) Reference: Ganong’s Review of Medical Physiology, 26th Edition, Page 167,168",

(Option B) Muller's Doctrine of Specific Nerve Energy : States that sensation evoked by a stimulus that generates impulse in the specific sensory pathway depends on the precise area of the brain that is eventually activated by the stimulus. (Option A) Law of Projection : States that no matter where a specific sensory pathway is stimulated along its course to the cortex, the sensation is referred to the location of the receptors.

Upper motor neurons (UMN): Neurons in the cortex and brainstem that activate lower motor neurons.

      "explanation": "Correct Answer: B) Decerebrate rigidity Explanation : The patient's posturing is characteristic of decerebrate rigidity. Feature Decerebrate Rigidity Decorticate Rigidity Definition A state of severe hypertonia characterized by extension of all four limbs. A state in which the upper extremities are flexed and the lower extremities are extended. Cause Damage to the lower midbrain and upper pons Damage to the upper midbrain Mechanism Loss of descending inhibition to the pontine reticular system causes overactivity of this system, which excites antigravity muscles. Rubrospinal tract excitation of flexor muscles in the upper extremities results in flexion due to damage above the red nucleus. Posture Arms adducted and extended Forearms pronated Wrists and fingers flexed Legs extended Feet plantar flexed Arms adducted and flexed Wrists and fingers flexed Legs extended Plantar flexion of the feet (Option A) Clinical Significance Severe brain stem damage; poor prognosis Better prognosis than decerebrate rigidity Cerebellar ataxia typically manifests as uncoordinated and inaccurate movements, often with intention tremor rather than the fixed, rigid posturing. (Option C) Spinal shock can occur after spinal cord injury and presents as a flaccid paralysis with loss of reflexes below the level of the lesion. (Option D)",
