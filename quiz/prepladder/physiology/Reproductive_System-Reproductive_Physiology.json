      "question": "A patient is being evaluated for male infertility. The fertility specialist explains the changes sperm undergo in the epididymis. Which of the following statements correctly describes a change that sperm undergo in the epididymis?",
      "options": {
        "A": "Ability to bind to zona pellucida develops after ejaculation.",
        "B": "Cytoplasm and cell volume increases in the epididymis.",
        "C": "Sperm gain motility and chemotaxis ability.",
        "D": "Capacitation for fertilization happens in the epididymis."
      },
      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "ability to sense chemical signals during their passage through the epididymis. Change Description Motility Acquisition Sperm leaving the testes are not fully mobile. They gain progressive motility in the epididymis. Motility is suppressed by inhibitory proteins until ejaculation. Cation Channel Activation Activation of CatSper family cation channels occurs. Alkaline-sensitive Ca2+ channels become active as sperm move to more alkaline cervical mucus. Chemotaxis Development Develop the ability to sense chemical signals from the ovaries, helping guide them toward the ovary. Concentration Become concentrated due to fluid reabsorption. Epididymal Fluid Contribution Epididymis and Sertoli cells secrete nutrient-rich fluid containing hormones, enzymes, and nutrients essential for maturation. Sperm Storage Epididymis serves as the primary storage site. Sperm can maintain fertility for at least a month. Timeframe for Motility Sperm gain the capability for motility after 18 to 24 hours in the epididymis. Full maturation and hypermotility occur in the female genital tract. Acrosome Maturation The acrosome, located at the sperm head and containing enzymes for fertilization, matures while sperm are stored in the epididymis. Decreased Cytoplasm and Cell Volume Sperm lose excess cytoplasm and decrease in overall cell volume as they mature in the epididymis. Zona Pellucida Binding Ability Sperm acquire receptors during epididymal transit that enable them to bind to the zona pellucida, facilitating penetration and fertilization of the egg. Capacitation Post-Epididymis Full fertilization capacity (capacitation) occurs after sperm leave the epididymis. This involves removal of inhibitory factors and changes to the sperm membrane.

      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "stimulates Leydig cells in the testes to produce more testosterone, leading to the development of secondary sexual characteristics. Puberty and Male Reproductive System Changes Increased Testosterone Production Surge in testosterone by Leydig cells in testes. Stimulated by LH from anterior pituitary. (Option B) Primary Sexual Characteristics Growth of penis, scrotum, and testes. (Option C) Secondary Sexual Characteristics Body Hair: Increased growth on pubic area, face, chest, etc. Voice Changes: Deeper voice due to larynx hypertrophy. Skin Changes: Thicker skin, increased sebaceous secretion, acne. Muscle Development: Increased muscle mass (50% greater than females). (Option A) Bone Growth: Enhanced thickness, calcium retention. Metabolic Effects: Increased basal metabolic rate (5-10%), potential increase in red blood cells. Spermatogenesis Sperm production begins and continues throughout life within seminiferous tubules of testes. Role of Hormones in Spermatogenesis FSH: Stimulates Sertoli cells for sperm support. Testosterone: Essential for germ cell growth. Inhibin: Produced by Sertoli cells to regulate FSH and spermatogenesis rate.

      "question": "Which of the following statements is true?",
      "options": {
        "A": "Sertoli cells and Leydig cells together form the blood-testis barrier",
        "B": "Leydig cells secrete testosterone and androgen-binding protein",
        "C": "Leydig cells can synthesize cholesterol de novo within them",
        "D": "Sertoli cells secrete Inhibin B to suppress the release of LH"
      },
      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "meet their cholesterol needs through both de novo synthesis and uptake of extracellular cholesterol from blood for the synthesis of testosterone. Function of Leydig cells: Testosterone secretion is facilitated by Leydig cells. Cholesterol serves as the primary precursor for testosterone synthesis. Leydig cells can synthesize cholesterol internally and also absorb it from the blood via LDL and HDL receptors. Converts DHEA into testosterone. Testosterone moves into the seminiferous tubules (adluminal compartment). Function of Sertoli cells: Only Sertoli cells form the blood-testis barrier (Option A) Nourishment and protection to developing sperm cells. Sertoli cells contain receptors for FSH (follicle-stimulating hormone) and androgens, which indirectly support spermatogenesis. Sertoli cells produce androgen binding protein (ABP). (Option B) Sertoli cells express the aromatase enzyme, responsible for converting testosterone to estrogen. They produce extracellular matrix components and anti-Müllerian hormone (AMH/MIS), which induces regression of Müllerian ducts during male fetal development. Sertoli cells secrete Inhibin B , a crucial factor in the testes that negatively regulates FSH secretion (Option D) through feedback mechanisms.

      "question": "A 14-year-old male presents with delayed puberty. Physical examination reveals small testicular volume and a lack of secondary sexual characteristics. Hormonal tests indicate low testosterone levels but elevated FSH levels. Which of the following functions of Sertoli cells is most likely compromised in this patient? α -reductase",
      "options": {
        "A": "Secretion of testosterone in response to LH stimulation",

        "D": "Support of spermatogenesis through FSH-mediated stimulation"
      },
      "correct_answer": "D",
      "explanation": "plausible explanation for the observed hormonal imbalances and clinical features is a compromised ability of Sertoli cells to respond to FSH stimulation , leading to both impaired spermatogenesis and, consequently, low testosterone levels. The reduced negative feedback from inhibin due to impaired Sertoli cell function further contributes to the elevated FSH levels. Hormones of Spermatogenesis: Follicular stimulating hormone: FSH is essential for the initial development of spermatogonia cells. Main targets of FSH action include: Proliferation of Sertoli cell Proliferation of Spermatogonia up to primary spermatocyte stage Support the process of meiosis. Testosterone: Testosterone is particularly required for the terminal stages of spermatogenesis Main targets of testosterone action include: Spermiogenesis (spermatid to mature sperm) Spermiation (release of sperm) Meiosis (suppression of testosterone leads to block in meiosis) Estrogen: Main targets of Estrogen include: Fluid resorption and concentration of sperm Acrosome biogenesis of sperm Growth hormone: Growth hormone specifically promotes early division of the spermatogonia Option A) Secretion of testosterone in response to LH stimulation is a function of Leydig cell Option B) Production of inhibin leading to increased FSH levels simply does not explain the low testosterone levels seen in this patient Option C) While testosterone does play a role in spermatogenesis, its production is mainly stimulated by LH acting on Leydig cells.

      "correct_answer": "D",
      "explanation": "are responsible for producing approximately 60% of the total volume of semen. The fluid from the seminal vesicles is rich in fructose and other substances that provide energy and aid in the motility of sperm. Sperm Maturation: Spermatogenesis : Begins during adolescence; takes ~74 days. Initial Mobility : Sperm are not fully mobile upon leaving the testes. Maturation : Occurs in the epididymis where sperm gain motility. Motility Mechanism : Involves activation of cation channel proteins (CatSper family) in the sperm tail. Alkaline Sensitivity : CatSpers form an alkaline-sensitive Ca2+ channel, activated as sperm transition from acidic vagina to alkaline cervical mucus. Sperm Capacitation Location : Occurs in the isthmus of the uterine tubes. Purpose : Prepares sperm for the acrosome reaction and increases motility. Contents of Semen Composition : Sperm and fluids from seminal vesicles, prostate, Cowper glands, and potentially urethral glands. Volume : 2.5–3.5 mL per ejaculation after several days of abstinence. Sperm Count : About 100 million sperm per mL. Fluid Source : Seminal vesicles: 60% (Option A) (Option D) Prostate: 20% (Option B) Bulbourethral glands: Remaining portion (Option C) Surface Proteins : Sperm contain proteins like fertilin for egg cell membrane fusion Reference: Ganong’s Review of Medical Physiology, 26th Edition, Page 405,412,414",

      "explanation": "Higher estrogen levels inhibit the release of GnRH from the hypothalamus by negative feedback mechanism. Thecal cells are regulated by LH. Granulosa cells are regulated by both LH and FSH. Circulating estrogens inhibit the secretion of GnRH, LH, and FSH. Inhibin from the granulosa cells inhibits FSH secretion. A moderate, constant level of circulating estrogen exerts a negative feedback effect on LH secretion. At 36–48 h before ovulation, the estrogen feedback effect becomes positive, and this initiates the burst of LH secretion (LH surge) that produces ovulation.
