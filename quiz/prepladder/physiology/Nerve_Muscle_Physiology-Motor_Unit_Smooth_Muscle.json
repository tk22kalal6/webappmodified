      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: B) B to C Explanation: When the sarcomere is at perfect length—about 2.2 micrometres—the actin and myosin overlap perfectly, allowing the muscle to contract optimally. The sarcomere maintains full tension as it shortens from 2.2 micrometres to 2 micrometres, i.e., from length B to C. Sarcomeres are units in the muscles composed of actin and myosin filaments. The amount of force or tension a muscle generates depends on the sarcomere's length. Length A: Actin and myosin do not overlap; thus, muscle cannot",

      "explanation": "Correct answer: D) Adrenaline Explanation: The agent labeled as B in the effects on the membrane potential of intestinal smooth muscle is Adrenaline . The addition of Adrenaline to intestinal smooth muscle results in hyperpolarization of the membrane potential, decreased frequency of action potentials, and relaxation of the muscle. Adrenaline (epinephrine) or norepinephrine acts as a neurotransmitter at noradrenergic nerve endings, inducing inhibitory potentials in smooth muscle. As a result, the muscle becomes less active, and the overall contractile force is reduced. In contrast, Acetylcholine (Option A ruled out) ( Labeled as A) has the opposite effect. When ACh is added to intestinal smooth muscle: The membrane potential becomes less negative (depolarization).

The primary sources of calcium for smooth muscle contraction are: Extracellular fluid: Calcium enters the cell through voltage-gated calcium channels in the cell membrane (Option A ruled out) Sarcoplasmic reticulum: This intracellular organelle stores and releases calcium (Option B ruled out) Calcium-induced calcium release amplifies the calcium signal by triggering further release from intracellular stores (Option D ruled out) Voltage-gated calcium channels allow calcium influx from the extracellular space when the cell membrane is depolarised.

      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: C) Slow wave rhythm Explanation: The rhythmic contractile activity seen in a specific group of GIT cells is a slow wave rhythm generated by pacemaker cells. Pacemaker cells of GIT are Interstitial cells of Cajal, similar to heart pacemaker cells. Slow wave rhythms are due to an excitatory process, and these are not action potentials. The exact cause of slow wave rhythms is not known, but two theories are suggested: Membrane potential becomes less negative when the sodium pump becomes less active and more negative when pumped rapidly. Rhythmical increase and decrease in ion channel conductance. When slow waves are strong enough, they generate action potentials, which cause rhythmical contraction, also known as pacemaker waves. Spike Potential (Option A): Generated due to the action of hormones or neurotransmitters, these potentials are seen in the gastrointestinal tract. Action potential with plateau (Option B): Generated in single unit smooth muscle cells such as the uterus and ureter. This potential causes prolonged contraction. Innervation of cells by ANS (Option D): This is seen in multiunit smooth muscle cells such as those of the ciliary, iris, and piloerector muscles.",

      "explanation": "contraction. Correct Answer: B) At tetanising frequency, successive contractions fuse into a smooth, continuous contraction. Explanation: At tetanising frequency, successive contractions fuse into a smooth, continuous contraction. At low-frequency stimulation, individual contractions occur one after another, but as the frequency increases, new contractions begin before the previous one ends; thus, the second contraction partially adds to the first. The total strength of contraction increases progressively. At a critical tetanising frequency, the contraction fuses together, and the muscle contraction appears smooth and continuous - Tetanization. Further, an increase in the frequency of stimulation does not increase contractile force. (Option C) This occurs when sufficient calcium ions are maintained in the muscle sarcoplasm even between two action potentials (AP) (Option D) Thus, a full contractile state is sustained without any relaxation between AP. Visible twitching occurs at lower frequencies when each stimulus produces a separate contraction. This is known as unfused tetanus.

      "correct_answer": "D",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: D) Accumulation of residual calcium ions in the cytoplasm Explanation: The Treppe phenomenon, or staircase phenomenon, occurs when the muscle contraction height gradually increases with repeated stimulations after reaching baseline. This is primarily attributed to the accumulation of residual calcium ions in the cytoplasm that were released during the previous stimulation, as pumping Calcium ions back by the SERCA pump requires some time. The height of the second contraction is more than that of the first contraction, known as the Beneficial effect. After several contractions, there will be no further increase in height. Increased availability of ATP in the muscle fibres (Option A): ATP is used in the cross-bridge cycling and relaxation processes, not in accumulating calcium ions. Faster pumping of calcium ions into the sarcoplasmic reticulum (Option B): The SERCA pump pumps calcium ions back into the sarcoplasmic reticulum, depleting calcium in the cytoplasm and aiding in Relaxation. Enhanced sensitivity of the muscle fibres to acetylcholine (Option C): Acetylcholine initiates muscle contraction by binding to receptors on the muscle cell membrane. While receptor sensitivity can affect muscle response, it does not explain the treppe phenomenon's mechanism of increase in the height of contraction..",

After nerve stimulation, the muscle fibres go through the following phases: Latent Period (LP) : Period before the onset of muscle contraction – 10 milliseconds Contraction Period (CP): Duration from the onset to the peak of contraction – 40 ms Relaxation Period (RP): Period that follows peak contraction period – 50 ms These phases collectively make up a total duration of around 100 milliseconds.

      },
      "correct_answer": "D",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: D) Latency period Explanation: The latency period is the brief delay between the application of the stimulus and the onset of muscle contraction, during which the action potential travels along the muscle fibre and calcium ions are released from the sarcoplasmic reticulum. Whenever the muscle contracts, it will produce some force known as increased tension generation by the muscle. In skeletal muscle, the Simple Muscle Twitch (SMT) is a contraction followed by a relaxation. Latency Period (LP): The interval between the initial stimulation and the beginning of muscle contraction. Contraction Period (CP) (Option B) : The time from the onset of contraction to the peak, during which force generation increases. Relaxation Period (RP) (Option C) : The phase during which the muscle relaxes and force/tension decreases. Refractory period(Option A): The refractory period is the time following an action potential during which a muscle fibre cannot be re-excited, ensuring that action potentials are separated. This does not represent the initial latency period in a simple muscle twitch. Reference: Guyton and Hall Textbook of Medical Physiology, 14th Edition, Page 88",

      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: B) Overlapping muscle contractions that increase total strength with higher frequency Explanation: As the frequency of stimulation increases, contractions overlap, summing to increase total force, leading to smooth, continuous contractions known as tetanisation. Frequency Summation and Tetanization: Low-frequency stimulation produces individual twitch contractions. (Option A) As frequency increases, contractions overlap, enhancing total strength. Contractions fuse into a smooth, continuous contraction called tetanisation at a critical frequency. Further frequency increases maintain maximum contraction strength without additional force increase. (Option D ) Tetany occurs because calcium ions remain in the muscle sarcoplasm between action potentials, sustaining full contraction without relaxation. Individual twitch contractions at low frequency (Option A) : It describes the initial phase before frequency summation and tetanisation. Relaxation between action potentials (Option C) During tetanisation, there is no relaxation between action potentials, resulting in sustained contraction. Maximum contraction strength with no further increase despite higher frequency (Option D): This describes the plateau after tetanisation is achieved, not the process itself.",

      "question": "Which of the following best describes the order in which the motor units are recruited?",
      "options": {
        "A": "Large motor units are excited first",
        "B": "Small motor units are relaxed first",

        "D": "Small motor units are excited first"
      },
      "correct_answer": "D",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: D) Small motor units are excited first Explanation: During motor unit recruitment, the small motor units are excited first, followed by the larger motor units, which is known as the size principle. Recruitment: The recruitment of motor units follows the size principle, where smaller motor units with fewer muscle fibres and lower force thresholds are activated first. As the load increases, progressively larger motor units are recruited to generate the necessary force. This allows for smooth and precise control of muscle contractions, starting with fine, low-force movements and progressing to stronger contractions as needed. Derecruitment: When the task is completed, the motor units are relaxed, known as the Derecruitment of a motor unit. The largest motor unit is derecruited first, followed by the smallest. Large motor units are excited first (Option A): Large motor units are recruited later in the process, as they are responsible for generating more force but lack precision. Small motor units are relaxed first (Option B): Motor units are not relaxed during the process of recruitment. Instead, they are sequentially activated. Large motor units are relaxed first (Option C): While large motor units might be derecruited first when the force demand decreases, the process of initial recruitment for increasing loads starts with smaller units.
