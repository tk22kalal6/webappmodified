      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "requires simultaneous signals at different synapses. Correct Answer: B) Temporal summation requires signals to occur close in time, spatial summation requires simultaneous signals at different synapses. Explanation: Temporal summation occurs when multiple excitatory signals at the same synapse happen close in time to reach the threshold and trigger an action potential. Spatial summation involves excitatory signals arriving simultaneously at different synapses, summating to reach the threshold. Feature Temporal Summation Spatial Summation Definition (Option B) Multiple subthreshold excitatory signals at the same synapse occurring close in time. Excitatory signals arriving at different synapses simultaneously or within a short timeframe. Threshold for Excitation (Option D) Summation of signals to reach the threshold potential for triggering an action potential. Combined effect of excitatory signals at multiple synapses to reach the threshold. Signal Source (Option A) Same synapse Different synapses Current Flow Local depolarizing current spreads from the same synapse. Local depolarizing currents from different synapses overlap. Role in Action Potentials Can trigger an action potential if signals are close enough in time to summate and reach threshold. Can trigger an action potential if multiple signals from different locations summate to reach threshold. Impact of Refractory Period (Option C) Limited by the refractory period; if signals are too far apart, they won't summate. Not directly limited by the refractory period; depends on spatial proximity of signals. Examples Neurons receiving frequent, rapid signals at a single synapse. Neurons receiving simultaneous input from multiple presynaptic neurons. The longer the time constant, the greater is the chance for two potentials to summate to induce an action potential (Temporal summation) Longer the length constant, greater the chance of Spatial summation.",

      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Correct answer: B) Negative feedback Explanation : K+ channels exert Negative feedback. K I channels provide negative feedback during an action potential by promoting repolarization. Their delayed opening after depolarization allows K I ions to exit the cell, reducing the positive membrane potential and stabilizing the neuron's electrical activity. This feedback mechanism is essential for the proper functioning of neurons and for the propagation of action potentials. Positive Feedback (Option A) : Increases the activity or response, leading to a greater output. For example, during the rapid depolarization phase of an action potential, when sodium channels open and more sodium enters, it leads to further depolarization. Feedforward (Option C) : Anticipates changes and adjusts the response accordingly, but this is not the main focus in the context of ion channel behavior. Voltage-Dependent Opening (Option D) : Refers to the way ion channels open in response to changes in membrane potential, but does not describe the feedback mechanism.",

Strength-Duration Relationship Parameters The strength-duration curve graphically depicts the relationship between the intensity of an electrical stimulus applied at a muscle's motor point and the duration required to produce a minimal muscle contraction. Rheobase: Minimum electrical current (or voltage) needed to induce an action potential when applied indefinitely. Typical Values: 2 to 18 mA (or 5 to 35 volts) for healthy muscle tissue. Clinical Insight: Higher values in denervated muscles indicate reduced excitability. Chronaxie: Minimum time required for a current that is double the rheobase intensity to stimulate the muscle. Normal Value: Generally below 1 ms. Clinical Insight: Longer chronaxie indicates lower excitability. Utilization Time: Duration needed for a stimulus of rheobasic strength to excite the nerve and produce muscle contraction. Clinical Insight: Crucial for understanding nerve activation dynamics and stimulus efficiency. Clinical Significance: Assessment: Parameters assess nerve function and excitability. The order of excitability among different tissues is generally: Neurons > skeletal muscles > myocardium > smooth muscles. Additionally, A fibers are the most excitable, followed by B",

      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: B) Different conduction velocities of various nerve fibers. Explanation: The multiple peaks in a compound action potential (CAP) indicate the summation of action potentials from different types of nerve fibers (e.g., A α , A β , B, and C fibers), each with distinct conduction velocities. The different peaks reflect the sequential activation of these fibers. Action Potential - Monophasic/ Biphasic/ Compound Monophasic Action Potential: Single directional deflection, recorded from a single fiber or small group. Recording: One electrode inside the cell, the other outside. Characteristics: Single Peak: Indicates action potential of a single fiber or small group. Amplitude: Does not significantly increase with stimulation strength Follows All-or-nothing Principle. It states that once an action potential is initiated in a nerve fiber, it will travel the entire length of the fiber if the conditions are suitable, or it will not travel at all if the conditions are not right. Biphasic Action Potential: Two-phase action potential with positive and negative deflections. Recording: Two electrodes of opposite polarity detect the wave of depolarization. Characteristics: Waveform: Upward deflection followed by a downward deflection. Relation to CAP: Component of CAP, reflecting the activity of multiple fibers. Compound Action Potential (CAP): Summation of action potentials from different nerve fibers (A α , A β , B, C) in a mixed nerve. Recording: Electrodes placed on the surface of the mixed nerve. Characteristics: Multiple Peaks: Correspond to different conduction velocities; A α fibers first. Amplitude: Increases with stronger stimulation.

Explanation: Increasing this resistance would hinder the spread of Na+ ions, making it more difficult to reach the threshold for action potential initiation at adjacent nodes of Ranvier. Conduction velocity of the Action potential. Factors Influencing Myelination : Increases conduction velocity, enabling saltatory conduction. (Option D) Axon Diameter : Larger diameter axons exhibit faster conduction velocities. (Option A) Temperature : Higher temperatures increase ion channel opening and closing speeds affecting conduction velocity. Classification of Nerve Fibers Larger, myelinated fibers (like A α fibers) - Faster conduction velocity. Smaller, unmyelinated fibers (like C fibers) - Slower conduction velocity. Clinical Significance A decrease in chronaxie after nerve repair suggests increased excitability and potential regeneration. Stimulus Strength A stronger stimulus doesn't increase the speed of an action potential in a single nerve fiber, it might activate a greater number of fibers. A lower capacitance means that the membrane can depolarize more rapidly, leading to faster conduction. Myelination is a key factor in reducing membrane capacitance.

      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: A) It causes depolarization, making the neuron more excitable. Explanation: The increased extracellular potassium concentration decreases the concentration gradient for potassium to leave the cell, leading to depolarization. Condition Hyperkalemia Hypokalemia RMP Depolarized (Decreased RMP) (Option C) Hyperpolarized (Increased RMP) (Option B) Explanation Increased extracellular potassium reduces the gradient for potassium to exit the cell, causing depolarization. The resting membrane potential becomes less negative than the typical -70 mV. In hypokalemia, cells lose more potassium ions due to leaky channels. The loss of positive charge increases the negative charge within the cell, causing hyperpolarization. Effect on Neuron Excitability Increased excitability can lead to spontaneous firing and even cell death. Persistent depolarization inactivates voltage-gated sodium channels, preventing action potential generation. Decreased excitability occurs as the membrane potential is further from the threshold for action potential. Hypokalemia also inhibits the Na-K-ATPase pump. Hypocalcemia: When blood calcium is normal or high, calcium remains bound to the extracellular mouth of voltage-gated Na I channels, stabilizing them. Low blood Ca 2+ (hypocalcemia) causes calcium to detach from the channel, leading to easier sodium entry. This detachment increases Na I channel sensitivity, enhancing excitability and action potential generation. Calcium and magnesium act as membrane stabilizers. Hyperkalemia can eventually lead to increased activity of the Na+/K+-ATPase pump as a compensatory mechanism, this is not a direct or immediate effect on the RMP. (Option D)",

      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: A) Ensures action potentials move in one direction along an axon. Explanation: Action potentials are self-propagating impulses that travel down an axon with constant amplitude and velocity. During the refractory period, the portion of the membrane that has just undergone depolarization is resistant to re-excitation. This resistance ensures that the action potential moves forward along the axon rather than propagating backward to already stimulated areas. Refractory period: Refractory period is a period of reduced excitability in a neuron following an action potential. Role : Ensuring unidirectional propagation of action potentials. Modulating action potential frequency. Characteristic Absolute Refractory Period Relative Refractory Period Definition The initial phase of the refractory period. The period during which a second action potential cannot be elicited, even with a strong stimulus. Follows the absolute refractory period The period during which a stronger than-normal stimulus can elicit a second action potential. Duration Sum of the total depolarization period and the first 1/3rd of the repolarization period of the action potential. Last 2/3rd of the repolarization period of the action potential. Excitability No stimulus, no matter how strong. Stronger than normal stimuli Voltage-Gated Na+ Channels Inactive or open state. Transition from the inactive to the closed state. Significance Limits the maximum frequency of action potentials a neuron can fire. Encoding of stimulus strength by modulating the frequency of action potentials. The refractory period mainly governs the neuron's ability to generate a second action potential, not the duration of an individual action potential. (Option B) While the refractory period influences a neuron's excitability, it doesn't directly determine the threshold intensity. (Option C) The refractory period actually makes it more difficult for local potentials to summate during its time course. (Option D)",

Feature Local Potentials Action Potentials Amplitude (Vs Option A&C) Graded; varies with stimulus strength All-or-nothing; amplitude remains constant once threshold is reached Propagation Decremental; diminishes with distance Non-decremental; maintains magnitude over long distances Summation (Option B) Can summate (spatial and temporal) Cannot summate; separated by refractory periods Function Initiate action potentials by reaching threshold at the axon hillock Transmit signals over long distances along nerve fibers Ionic Basis Involves ion movements, similar to action potentials, but often localized Depolarization and repolarization driven by voltage-gated Na I and K I channels Excitatory Postsynaptic Potentials (EPSPs): Local, Graded Potentials Depolarizing events that can trigger an action potential. Excitatory neurotransmitters bind to receptors, opening ion channels and allowing positively charged ions to enter the cell. Action potential triggered if depolarization reaches around -55 mV. Action Potential Stages: Depolarization - Opening of Na channels → fast Repolarization - Inactivation of Na channels and Exit of K → slow Hyperpolarization - Slow closure of K channels (Extra K exits) Propagation of Action Potential: Mechanism : Action potentials travel along the nerve fiber without diminishing. Depolarization at one site causes local current flow that triggers action potentials in adjacent regions. All-or-Nothing Principle : An action potential occurs only if the threshold is reached, maintaining consistent magnitude regardless of stimulus strength. Refractory Periods: Absolute Refractory Period : Na+ channels are inactivated, preventing another action potential. Relative Refractory Period : Requires a stronger stimulus to trigger another action potential due to partial repolarization. Myelination and Saltatory Conduction: Myelin Sheath insulates nerve fibers, formed by Schwann cells. Action potentials \"jump\" between nodes of Ranvier, speeding up transmission and saving energy. Energy Dependence: Na I -K I Pump restores ionic gradients after an action potential, consuming ATP. Factors Influencing Excitability: Calcium Ions (Ca² I ) : Low extracellular Ca² I increases excitability by lowering the activation threshold for Na I channels; high Ca² I decreases excitability. Local Anesthetics : Block voltage-gated Na I channels, reducing excitability and preventing action potentials.",

      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: B) Depolarization: RMP more positive; Hyperpolarization: RMP more negative. I enters the neuron. Hyperpolarization: RMP becomes more negative due to excessive K I outflow or Cl I influx. Resting Membrane Potential: Typical Value: ~ -65 mV Inside of the neuron is more negatively charged than the outside. Primarily influenced by ion concentration gradients, especially potassium (K I ). Potassium Pump: Actively transports K I ions into the neuron, maintaining higher internal concentration. Creates a tendency for K I ions to diffuse out, contributing to the negative resting potential. Depolarization: Sudden shift from negative to positive membrane potential. Mechanism: Increased permeability to Na I ions allows rapid influx of Na I , neutralizing the negative potential. In large nerve fibers, Na I influx can cause the membrane potential to briefly become positive (overshoot). Excitatory Postsynaptic Potentials (EPSPs): Depolarizing events that can trigger an action potential. Excitatory neurotransmitters bind to receptors, opening ion channels and allowing positively charged ions to enter. Action potential is triggered if depolarization reaches around -45 mV. Repolarization: Return of membrane potential to resting state (-65 mV) following depolarization. Na I channels close, reducing Na I influx. K+ channels open wider, allowing K I ions to exit rapidly. Restores negative membrane potential. Hyperpolarization: Membrane potential becomes more negative than the resting potential, below -65 mV. Inhibitory Neurotransmitters: Open channels allowing negatively charged ions (e.g., Cl I ) to enter or positively charged (e.g., K I ) to exit. Prolonged Potassium Channel Opening: Allows additional K I outflow. Effect: Moves potential closer to the potassium Nernst potential, making the neuron less likely to fire immediately. Recovery: Gradual return to threshold potential for new action potential generation. Inhibitory Postsynaptic Potentials (IPSPs): Hyperpolarizing events that make it harder for the neuron to fire an action potential.

      "explanation": "Correct Answer: A) 61 mV Explanation: According to the question, [Na I ]outside = 120 mEq/L [Na I ]inside I = 12 mEq/L Using the Nernst equation: 'z' is the electrical charge of the ion (+1 for K+). Therefore, Eq= 61 log (120/12) = 61 log (10) = 61*(1) = 61 mV The Nernst equation calculates the electrical potential difference across a membrane (Nernst potential) that balances the diffusion of a specific ion, preventing further net movement despite a concentration gradient. The Nernst equation calculates the Nernst potential (EMF) for a single, univalent ion (an ion with a +1 or -1 charge) at normal body temperature (37°C) The Nernst potential magnitude depends on the ion concentration ratio across the membrane; larger differences result in higher potentials. Nernst equation calculates the potential for a single ion, although cell membranes are permeable to multiple ions. Applications of the Nernst Equation: Explains how ion concentration differences generate electrical potential across a selectively permeable membrane. Basis for the Goldman-Hodgkin-Katz equation, which calculates membrane potential considering multiple ions and their permeabilities. Limitations: It works best for systems with only one permeant ion. In living cells, this is rarely the case, making the Goldman equation a more accurate representation.",

They are always open. The most important leak channel is the K+ leak channel, which allows the passive transfer of K+ from inside the cell to outside. This helps in creating the resting membrane potential of the neuron (Option C) The resting membrane potential is crucial for neurons in generating and propagating action potentials.

A neuron is the structural and functional unit of the nervous system, identified as an excitable cell due to its ability to generate action potentials when electrically stimulated. The neuron has three parts: Cell body, Dendrite and Axon that ends at the axon terminal. Axon Cell Body (Soma) Dendrites Long tubular process extending from the cell body to transmit signals to target organs. Originates from the axon hillock, a thickened area of the cell body. The initial segment , just after the axon hillock, is where action potentials are generated. Axon terminal: The terminal part of the axon loses myelin and branches into telodendria , which end in synaptic knobs (terminal buttons) containing neurotransmitters. It is the center of the neuron containing the nucleus, which is the metabolic center and stores DNA. Contains organelles like Nissl bodies (stacks of endoplasmic reticulum with ribosomes), mitochondria, Golgi apparatus, and lysosomes. Capable of protein synthesis with numerous Nissl granules. Lacks centrioles, limiting regenerative capacity. Contains cytoskeletal proteins like neurofilaments, microtubules, and actin microfilaments (In Alzheimer’s, neurofilaments form neurofibrillary tangles). These are numerous short extensions from the cell body that receive incoming signals and transmit them into the cell body. Have dendritic spines to increase surface area for signal reception. Contain Nissl granules for protein synthesis; involved in generating and conducting action potentials. Typically, about 10,000 dendrites per neuron are in the CNS. Axons often acquire a myelin sheath, a protein-lipid complex wrapped around the axon. The myelin sheath envelops the axon except at the nodes of Ranvier, periodic 1 micron gaps where the axon is unmyelinated.",
