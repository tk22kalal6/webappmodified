This is commonly observed in the cerebellum, which helps regulate motor control and coordination. Feature Feedback Inhibition Feedforward Inhibition Definition Inhibition where the output of a process inhibits its own production. Inhibition where an excitatory neuron directly inhibits another neuron in response to input. Mechanism The end product of a metabolic pathway inhibits an enzyme involved in the pathway. An excitatory neuron activates an inhibitory neuron and then inhibits a downstream neuron. Function It helps maintain homeostasis by regulating the production of substances. Anticipates and prevents excessive excitation in neural circuits. Example The inhibition of an enzyme in a metabolic pathway by its end product (e.g., ATP inhibiting phosphofructokinase). In the cerebellum, excitatory inputs inhibit output neurons to prevent overexcitation. Renshaw cells (Option A) are involved in feedback inhibition rather than feedforward inhibition.

      "explanation": "Correct Answer: C) GABA Explanation: GABA mediates presynaptic inhibition/Indirect Inhibition via a G-protein that causes an increase in K+ conductance. GABA is released onto the outer surfaces of presynaptic nerve terminals. Mechanism of action : GABA opens anion channels, allowing chloride ions to diffuse into the terminal fibril. The negative charges of chloride ions cancel out much of the excitatory effect of incoming sodium ions. Functions of presynaptic inhibition : It occurs before the signal reaches the synapse It's common in sensory pathways and helps minimise sideways spread and mixing of signals Features Indirect Inhibition Direct Inhibition Site of action Presynaptic terminal Postsynaptic neuron Primary mechanism Reduces neurotransmitter release.

        "D": "No effect on membrane potential"
      },
      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: C) Increases membrane potential, farther from firing threshold Explanation: IPSPs (Inhibitory Postsynaptic Potentials) are hyperpolarizations that occur when certain neurotransmitters activate Cl − channels on the postsynaptic membrane, allowing Cl − to enter the cell. This causes the neuron to hyperpolarize, peaking 1–1.5 ms after the stimulus and then declining exponentially. This hyperpolarisation shifts the membrane potential further from the firing threshold, reducing the neuron's excitability and necessitating greater excitatory input to reach the threshold (Option C) . IPSPs can also occur through mechanisms such as: Opening of K+ channels, allowing K+ to exit the cell Closure of Na+ channels Closure of Ca2+ channels Increases the rate of neurotransmitter release (Option A): IPSPs do not influence neurotransmitter release; they affect the neuron's membrane potential. Decreases membrane potential, closer to firing threshold (Option B): IPSPs cause hyperpolarisation, which makes the membrane potential more negative and farther from the firing threshold. No effect on membrane potential (Option D): IPSPs affect the membrane potential by making it more negative, moving it further from the threshold.

Na+-dependent uptake systems in neurons and glia clear glutamate from the brain's extracellular fluid (Option A) . Excessive levels of glutamate can occur in response to ischemia, anoxia, hypoglycemia, or trauma. During a stroke Occlusion of a cerebral artery leads to cell death in the ischemic area. Surrounding partially ischemic cells may survive but lose their ability to maintain the transmembrane Na+ gradient. Elevated intracellular Na+ levels impair astrocytes' ability to remove glutamate from the extracellular fluid (Option D) .

        "D": "Influx of chloride ions"
      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: B) Influx of calcium ions Explanation: During an EPSP, calcium ions (Ca2+) influx occurs when excitatory neurotransmitters bind to postsynaptic receptors, causing depolarisation and increased neuron excitability. Excitatory Postsynaptic Potential (EPSP): Mechanism: Excitatory neurotransmitters bind to receptors on the postsynaptic membrane, causing the opening of Na2+ or Ca2+ channels. This results in the influx of Na2+ or Ca2+ into the postsynaptic neuron, leading to depolarization. Effect: A single stimulus typically does not produce a propagated action potential in the postsynaptic neuron but results in a transient partial depolarisation called an EPSP. Neuron Excitability: During an EPSP, the neuron's excitability to subsequent stimuli increases. Propagation: The area of current flow is localised, meaning the EPSP only affects a small region of the membrane and does not depolarise the entire membrane. Summation: Multiple EPSPs from various synaptic knobs can summate, leading to significant depolarisation and increased neuronal excitability. Efflux of sodium ions (Option A): During EPSP, sodium ions flow into the neuron, not out of it. This influx contributes to the depolarisation of the postsynaptic membrane. Influx of potassium ions (Option C): Potassium ions typically move out of the cell, not into the cell, during an excitatory postsynaptic potential. Influx of chloride ions (Option D): The influx of chloride ions typically results in hyperpolarisation, producing an inhibitory postsynaptic potential (IPSP), not an excitatory postsynaptic potential (EPSP).

      "explanation": "Correct Answer: C) Glycine Explanation: At the spinal cord level: Glycine acts as a primary inhibitory neurotransmitter. It plays a crucial role in regulating motor neuron activity by hyperpolarising postsynaptic neurons, thereby reducing their excitability. Dysfunction or deficiency in glycine can lead to increased motor neuron excitability, resulting in symptoms such as muscle spasms and exaggerated reflexes. In CNS: Glycine has both inhibitory and excitatory action in the central nervous system. A small amount of extracellular glycine is essential for the proper functioning of the NMDA channel. Although glycine is an inhibitory neurotransmitter, it is necessary to activate the NMDA receptor, which plays a role in excitatory neurotransmission. GABA (Option A) is an inhibitory neurotransmitter primarily found in the brain and less involved in spinal motor neuron regulation than glycine. Glutamate (Option B) is an excitatory neurotransmitter in the brain that facilitates neuronal signalling.

      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: B) Tetanus toxin Explanation: The clinical presentation of severe muscle stiffness, trismus, and muscle spasms following an injury with a rusty nail suggests tetanus, caused by the tetanus toxin (tetanospasmin). Tetanus toxin is produced by Clostridium tetani bacteria in soil and enters the body through wounds. Mechanism of Tetanus Toxin at the synapse: Tetanus neurotoxin (TeNT) binds to the presynaptic membrane of the neuromuscular junction, is internalised, and then transported retroaxonally to the spinal cord. It induces Spastic paralysis due to the blockade of neurotransmitter releases such as GABA and glycine from presynaptic terminals of spinal inhibitory interneurons, leading to unopposed excitation of motor neurons and muscle rigidity. The toxin breaks down synaptobrevin protein through its endopeptidase activity. Botulinum toxins (Option A): These are potent neurotoxins produced by Clostridium botulinum bacteria. There are several types, with types A, B, and E being toxic to humans. Mechanism : Botulinum toxins A and E cleave SNAP-25 (synaptosome-associated protein-25), and B cleave Synaptobrevin, which are presynaptic membrane proteins essential for releasing acetylcholine at the neuromuscular junction leading to Flaccid paralysis. Strychnine (Option C): Strychnine is a naturally occurring alkaloid found in the seeds of plant Strychnos nux-vomica. It acts by blocking glycine receptors in the spinal cord, resulting in exaggerated muscle contractions (spasms) and potentially severe muscle rigidity. Curare (Option D): Curare is a neuromuscular blocking agent that competitively blocks acetylcholine receptors at the neuromuscular junction, leading to muscle paralysis.",

      "explanation": "Correct Answer: D) Complexin Explanation: In the presynaptic membrane mechanism, complexin binds to the SNARE complex, preventing premature fusion of synaptic vesicles with the presynaptic membrane until calcium influx triggers its dissociation. This regulatory function ensures that neurotransmitter release occurs at the appropriate time and in response to neuronal activity. Pre synaptic membrane Mechanism: Docking stage : Synaptobrevin (V-SNARE) on synaptic vesicles binds to syntaxin and SNAP-25 (t-SNARE) on the presynaptic membrane. (Option A, B, C) ATP and SM protein : ATP hydrolysis provides energy for protein coiling. SM proteins (Sec1/MUNC 18) regulate SNARE protein interactions. Priming stages : Primary priming : Protein coils bring vesicles closer to the presynaptic membrane. Secondary priming : Complexin stabilises the SNARE complex, preventing premature fusion. Calcium regulation : P/Q and N-type calcium channels open upon stimulation, allowing calcium influx, which removes complexin. Fusion stage : Synaptobrevin and syntaxin further coil with SNAP-25, facilitating the fusion of vesicular and presynaptic membranes. Release : Fusion leads to neurotransmitter release into the synaptic cleft. Reference: Ganong’s Review of Medical Physiology, 26th Edition, Page 123",

      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: A) Small clear vesicles Explanation: Small clear vesicles contain glutamate along with other neurotransmitters. The vesicles and proteins within them are mostly synthesised in the neuronal cell body and transported by fast axoplasmic transport. Small vesicles are located near the synaptic cleft and discharge their contents into active zones. Types of vesicles Neurotransmitters Small clear vesicles Acetylcholine, GABA, glutamate Small dense core vesicles (Option C) Catecholamines(eg:dopamine,epinephrine and norepinephrine) Large dense core vesicles (Option B) Neuropeptides Endosomes (Option D): It plays an important role in endocytosis but has No role in neurotransmitter release.

      "question": "A researcher studying the precision of synaptic connections between neurons focuses on how specific neurons target each other for communication. Which of the following concepts refers to the precise targeting of synaptic connections to ensure accurate neuronal communication?",
      "options": {
        "A": "Synaptic specificity",
        "B": "Active zones",
        "C": "Synaptobrevin",
        "D": "Postsynaptic density"
      },
      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: D) Synaptic specificity Explanation: Synaptic specificity refers to the precise targeting of neurons to form connections with the appropriate partner neurons. It involves mechanisms that ensure accurate and specific communication between neurons, which is crucial for proper neural network formation and function. It is maintained by neurexins and neuroligins interaction, which stabilise synapses. Neurexins are presynaptic cell adhesion molecules, while neuroligins are located on the postsynaptic membrane. Active zones (Option B): These are specialised regions in the presynaptic terminal where neurotransmitter release occurs. They are crucial for the release process but do not directly involve the specific targeting or connection of neurons. Synaptobrevin (Option C): This protein facilitates the release of neurotransmitters from vesicles in the presynaptic terminal by aiding in vesicle fusion. It does not contribute to the specific targeting or connection of neurons. Postsynaptic density (Option D): This region on the postsynaptic membrane contains receptors and signalling proteins crucial for organising postsynaptic responses. It does not address neuronal targeting or synaptic connection precision.",

      "question": "A 52-year-old male patient complains of visual disturbances and difficulty walking. On detailed examination, the patient is diagnosed with multiple sclerosis that occurs due to demyelination of neurons. Which of the following cells is involved in this condition?",
      "options": {
        "A": "Microglia",
        "B": "Oligodendrocytes",
        "C": "Schwann cells",

      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: B) Oligodendrocytes Explanation: Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a central nervous system (CNS) disorder characterised by the degeneration of oligodendrocytes, which are responsible for forming myelin sheaths around nerve fibres. Loss of myelin leads to leakage of K+ through voltage-gated channels, which in turn leads to hyperpolarisation or abnormal depolarisation, impaired nerve signal conduction, and symptoms such as paraparesis, paresthesia, optic neuritis, dysarthria, and dysphagia. Myelination of CNS and PNS Characteristics Peripheral nervous system Central nervous system Cells involved in Myelination One Schwann cell for one neuron. One Oligodendrocyte for multiple neurons. Demyelinating disease Localised disease (e.g., Guillain-Barré Syndrome) Diffuse disease (e.g., Multiple Sclerosis) Covering of unmyelinated neuron Surrounded by the Schwann cell process. Bare (no myelin sheath) Microglia (Option A) are non-neural cells that act like scavenger cells and remove debris formed by infection, injury, and disease; they have no role in myelination. Astrocytes (Option D) are supporting cells that provide nutrition and maintain glutamate levels but don’t have a role in myelin sheath formation.
