      "correct_answer": "D",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: D) A-V anastomoses found in earlobes have thick, muscular walls Explanation: Arteriovenous anastomoses (A-V anastomoses) , also known as shunts, are direct connections between arterioles and venules that bypass the capillary bed. They have thick, muscular walls and are abundantly innervated, likely by vasoconstrictor nerve fibers. These shunts are found in the fingers, palms, and earlobes. Other types of Blood vessels: Blood Vessel Type Blood Volume Arteries Carry oxygenated blood away from the heart. Arteries have elastic tissue in their walls, allowing them to stretch and recoil with the pumping of the heart. 8% Arterioles They are the primary site of resistance to blood flow Contain a high proportion of smooth muscle 1% Capillaries Tiny vessels with thin walls for the exchange of gases, nutrients, and waste products between blood and tissues. 5% Veins Veins have thinner walls allowing them to distend easily and accommodate larger volumes of blood. Contain venous valves to prevent backflow of blood 54% (Option B) Types of capillaries: Capillaries, due to their large cross-sectional area, provide low resistance to blood flow. The arterioles actually provide the maximum total peripheral resistance ( Option A) Veins, not arteries, contain the most blood volume in the systemic circulation ( Option B) The typical pore size in fenestrated capillaries is around 60-80 nm( Option C) Reference: Ganong's Review of Medical Physiology, 26th Edition, Page 558-561",

      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "particles moving in parallel layers. Correct Answer: C) Laminar blood flow occurs at low velocities and high fluid viscosity, with fluid particles moving in parallel layers. Explanation: Laminar blood flow is where the fluid moves in smooth, parallel layers with minimal mixing, typically occurring at low velocities and high viscosity. Laminar Flow Smooth, orderly flow of fluid in parallel layers with no disruption between the layers. Characteristics : Fluid particles move in straight, parallel paths. Velocity of fluid is highest at the center and decreases towards the vessel walls. Occurs at lower velocities and with lower fluid density or higher fluid viscosity (Option B) . Turbulent Flow Chaotic, irregular flow where fluid particles move in various directions, often forming eddies. Characteristics : Disorganized movement with mixing of fluid layers (Option A) . Velocity varies unpredictably at any point in the fluid. Higher resistance compared to laminar flow. Occurs at higher velocities, with higher fluid density, or lower fluid viscosity. Reynolds Number (Re) Dimensionless numbers used to predict flow patterns in fluid dynamics. Interpretation : Re < 2000 : Flow is typically laminar. Re > 4000 : Flow is typically turbulent. Re 2000-4000 : Transitional flow, where both laminar and turbulent flow may exist. Korotkoff Sounds Sounds heard while measuring blood pressure using a sphygmomanometer and stethoscope. Mechanism : Created by turbulent blood flow in the brachial artery when external pressure is between systolic and diastolic pressures. As cuff pressure drops below systolic pressure, blood begins to flow turbulently (Option D) , producing Korotkoff sounds. When cuff pressure drops below diastolic pressure, laminar flow is restored, and sounds disappear. Reference: Guyton and Hall Textbook of Medical Physiology, Edition 14, Page 175, 176, 186.",

      "explanation": "Correct Answer: C) Bezold-Jarisch reflex Explanation: Myocardial ischemia and reperfusion activates chemosensitive vagal C fibers in the cardiopulmonary region causing Bezold–Jarisch reflex leading to profound bradycardia, hypotension, and a brief period of apnea followed by rapid shallow breathing. Bezold-Jarisch reflex or coronary chemoreflex: Activators : Capsaicin, serotonin, phenylbiguanide, veratridine and pathophysiologic conditions like reperfusion after myocardial ischemia ( increased production of oxygen radicals and agents used as radio contrast for coronary angiography). Mechanism: Activation of chemosensitive vagal C fibers (Option C) in the cardiopulmonary region (juxtacapillary region of alveoli, ventricles, atria, great veins, and pulmonary artery). Causing bradycardia, hypotension, and a brief apnea period followed by rapid shallow breathing. Cushing reflex (Option A): A combination of hypertension, bradycardia, and irregular respiration is known as the triad of the Cushing reflex. Bainbridge reflex(Option B): Following vagotomy, the reflex is abolished as the responses are mediated by vagus nerves shown below.

      "correct_answer": "D",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: D) Regulation of coronary blood flow involves local metabolites Explanation: Regulation of coronary blood flow involves primarily local metabolites like adenosine, hydrogen ions, lactic acid, potassium ions and certain prostaglandins by mechanism known as metabolite mediated vasodilatation. Coronary perfusion: Key points Explanation Coronary circulation Supplies heart muscles Major coronary arteries Left and right coronary arteries Rate of blood flow in myocardium 250ml/minute Percentage of blood flow in heart 5% of cardiac output The right and left coronary arteries originate from the coronary sinuses at the aortic root. These arteries extend along the epicardium, and then branch through the myocardium to form subendocardial plexuses to perfuse the myocardium. Myocardial contraction during systole compresses arterial branches and prevents perfusion. Coronary perfusion occurs during diastole rather than systole from epicardial to endocardial regions. Coronary perfusion pressure: (Option B) Coronary Perfusion Pressure (CPP) = Aortic Diastolic Pressure – Left Ventricular end-diastolic Pressure (LVEDP). Aortic systolic pressure; 120 mmHg Aortic diastolic pressure: 80 mmHg Blood flow to the left ventricle occurs only during the early stage of diastole (isovolumetric relaxation) (Option A) Blood flow in the right ventricle occurs during systole and diastole. Blood flow increases in systole than in diastole. (Option C) Regulation of coronary perfusion: Chemical Factors: Regulation of blood flow occurs primarily through vasodilation caused by local metabolites (Option D) which are formed due to 70-80% oxygen extraction of myocardium from the coronary arteries. Metabolites are CO2 , H+, K+, lactate, prostaglandins, adenine nucleotides, and adenosine.

        "D": "The force-velocity relationship in cardiac muscle is inverse and hyperbolic"
      },
      "correct_answer": "D",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: D) The force-velocity relationship in cardiac muscle is inverse and hyperbolic property of cardiac muscle mechanics describes how the velocity of muscle shortening is related to the force (or tension) developed by the muscle. As the load (force) against which the muscle contracts increases, the velocity of shortening decreases. When the muscle contracts against a lighter load, it can shorten more quickly. This relationship is not linear but follows a hyperbolic curve. At zero load, the muscle shortens at its maximum velocity (Vmax), while at maximum isometric force, the shortening velocity is zero. This is how the heart can maintain adequate cardiac output over a wide range of afterloads by adjusting its contractile properties. Preload primarily affects the force of contraction, not the velocity of muscle shortening. This is based on the Frank-Starling mechanism (Option A) Afterload does affect the duration of systole. Increased afterload can prolong the duration of systole as the ventricle requires more time to generate sufficient pressure to open the aortic valve and eject blood (Option B) More EDV( which is the best determinant of preload) leads to increased tension in the cardiac muscle. ↑ EDV → ↑ ventricular muscle length → ↑ muscle contraction force (contractility of the heart). This is known as the Frank-Starling law of the heart (Option C)",

      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "brain tissue volume Correct Answer: A) An increase in cerebrospinal fluid volume can be compensated by a decrease in brain tissue volume Explanation: The Monro-Kellie doctrine states that the cranial compartment is incompressible, and the volume inside the cranium is fixed hence Option A in the incorrect statement.The doctrine describes the relationship between the volumes of brain tissue, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), and blood within the cranium. According to this principle, an increase in one component must be offset by a decrease in one or both of the other components to maintain a constant intracranial pressure. Brain tissue is not easily compressible, and its volume does not acutely decrease to compensate for increases in other components . Therefore, compensatory mechanisms primarily involve changes in CSF and blood volumes. During a rise in intracranial pressure, CSF can be displaced into the spinal subarachnoid space or its production can be reduced, and/ or venous blood can be displaced from the cranial cavity. An increase in blood volume can be compensated by a decrease in CSF volume (Option B) The Principle of the Monro-Kellie doctrine is that the sum of the volumes of brain tissue, blood, and CSF must remain constant within the rigid confines of the skull (Option C) Small increases in the volume of one component can often be compensated without a significant change in ICP, due to the compensatory mechanisms described earlier. However, once these compensatory mechanisms are exhausted, even small volume increases can lead to dramatic rises in ICP (Option D)",
