      "explanation": "Correct Answer: A) Salivary secretion Explanation: Saliva is a hypotonic secretion, not an isotonic one. Saliva contains high concentrations of potassium (K+) and bicarbonate (HCO3-) ions and lower concentrations of sodium (Na+) and chloride (Cl-) ions, making it a hypotonic solution. Except for saliva, all other gastrointestinal secretions, such as Gastric (Option B), Pancreatic (Option C) and intestinal secretions (Option D) , have osmolality similar to osmolality plasma, i.e., isotonic. Saliva is secreted by acinar cells of salivary glands.",

      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: C) Ferrous (Fe² I ) form of iron is absorbed more readily than the ferric (Fe³ I ) form. I ) form and must be reduced to the ferrous (Fe² I ) form by gastric secretions and reductase enzymes in the brush borders of enterocytes. Absorption of Iron: Most dietary iron is ferric (Fe³ I ), and the absorbed form is ferrous (Fe² I ). Fe³ I is reduced to Fe² I by gastric secretions and reductase activity in enterocytes. Iron absorption occurs mainly in the duodenum via divalent metal transporter 1 (DMT1). Some Fe² I is stored in ferritin within enterocytes, and the remaining is transported out by ferroportin 1. Hephaestin (Hp) aids basolateral transport. In plasma, Fe² I converts to Fe³ I and binds to transferrin, a transport protein that delivers iron to various tissues. Iron is stored in the body primarily as: Ferritin: A soluble protein complex that stores iron safely in the liver, spleen, bone marrow, and intestinal mucosa. Hemosiderin: A less soluble and more stable iron-storage complex, mainly found in macrophages, especially under iron overload conditions. Iron is primarily absorbed in the jejunum (Option A): Most iron absorption occurs in the duodenum, not the jejunum. The duodenum is the first part of the small intestine immediately beyond the stomach. The acidic environment helps in the reduction of Fe³ I to Fe² I , which is then absorbed. Phytic acid in cereals enhances iron absorption (Option B): Phytic acid in cereals inhibits iron absorption. It binds to iron and forms insoluble complexes that the intestines cannot absorb. Oxalates and phosphates also inhibit iron absorption. Hepcidin directly binds to transferrin to regulate iron levels (Option C): Hepcidin regulates iron levels by binding to ferroportin, causing its degradation. This decreases iron transport from enterocytes into the bloodstream.",

      "explanation": "Correct Answer: D) The final step of protein digestion occurs inside the cytosol of Enterocytes. down remaining dipeptides and tripeptides into amino acids. Process of Protein Digestion: 1. In Stomach: Enzyme: Pepsin ( Optimal pH: 2.0 to 3.0) Function: Pepsin initiates protein digestion (Option A) by breaking proteins into proteoses, peptones, and smaller polypeptides. Collagen Breakdown: Pepsin is crucial for digesting collagen in meats (Option C) , allowing other digestive enzymes to access and break down meat proteins. Contribution: Pepsin accounts for 10-20% of total protein digestion . (Option B) . 2. In Small Intestine: (Duodenum and Jejunum) Most of the Protein Digestion occurs in SI. Enzymes: Pancreatic proteolytic enzymes (trypsin, chymotrypsin, carboxypolypeptidase, elastase) Function: Trypsin and Chymotrypsin: Split proteins into small polypeptides. Carboxypolypeptidase: Cleaves individual amino acids from polypeptides. Elastase: Digests elastin fibres in meats. Outcome: Proteins are mostly reduced to dipeptides and tripeptides. Most amino acids are absorbed by sodium through a co-transporter molecule, which is part of secondary active transport. They can also be absorbed in the form of di or tripeptides by the PepT1 Transporter. 3. Final Digestion and Absorption: (Brush border of enterocytes in the small intestine villi) Enzymes: Aminopolypeptidase and dipeptidases Function: Brush Border Peptidases Intracellular Peptidases Break down remaining dipeptides and tripeptides into amino acids within the enterocyte cytosol. (Final Step) Absorption: Over 99% of absorbed protein digestion products are individual amino acids. Peptides and whole protein molecules are rarely absorbed, and they can cause allergic reactions.

      "question": "A newborn presents with severe diarrhoea and dehydration shortly after birth. Stool analysis reveals undigested and unabsorbed carbohydrates. Which of the following mechanisms is most likely impaired in this patient?",
      "options": {
        "A": "SGLT1-mediated absorption of glucose and galactose",
        "B": "GLUT5-mediated absorption of fructose",
        "C": "Peptidase-mediated breakdown",
        "D": "Lipase mediated breakdown"
      },
      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: A) SGLT1-mediated absorption of glucose and galactose Explanation: Glucose Galactose Malabsorption (GGM) is a rare genetic disorder caused by mutations in the SGLT1 gene, which encodes for the sodium-glucose cotransporter 1 (SGLT-1). When glucose and galactose are not absorbed, they remain in the intestinal lumen, which draws water due to their osmotic properties resulting in osmotic diarrhoea and dehydration, as seen in this newborn. Mechanism of Carbohydrate Absorption: Transporters involved in the Mechanism of absorption of Carbohydrates: Glucose and Galactose Absorption (SGLT1): SGLT1 is a transporter found on the surface of intestinal cells. It actively transports glucose and galactose from the intestine into these cells using energy derived from sodium ions moving down their concentration gradient. (Secondary active transport). Fructose Absorption (GLUT5): GLUT5 (Option B) is another transporter located on the surface of intestinal cells. It facilitates the diffusion of fructose from the intestine into these cells without requiring energy (Facilitated diffusion). Fructose is transported independently of sodium. GLUT 2: It transports glucose, galactose, and fructose across the basolateral membrane of intestinal cells into the bloodstream. This ensures that absorbed glucose, galactose, and fructose enter the bloodstream for cell use throughout the body. Peptidases (Option C): Peptidases are enzymes that break down proteins into peptides and amino acids, not carbohydrates. Lipases (Option D): Lipases are associated with the breakdown of Fats. An impairment in lipase activity would lead to fat malabsorption and steatorrhea (fatty stools), not undigested carbohydrates.",

      },
      "correct_answer": "D",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: D) Paneth cells Explanation: Zinc plays a critical role in immune function and is particularly concentrated in Paneth cells within the small intestine. Paneth cells are specialised immune cells found in the intestinal crypts of Lieberkuhn, primarily in the small intestine. They are known for secreting antimicrobial peptides, such as defensins and lysozymes, which help protect the gut against infections. Goblet cells (Option A): Goblet cells are specialised epithelial cells throughout the intestines that secrete mucus. This mucus forms a protective layer over the epithelial surface, safeguarding the intestinal lining from mechanical and chemical damage. Enteroendocrine cells (Option B): Enteroendocrine cells are scattered throughout the gastrointestinal tract and produce hormones like serotonin, gastrin, and cholecystokinin. These hormones are involved in digestion, appetite regulation, and gut motility. Enterocytes (Option C): Enterocytes are the absorptive cells lining the intestinal villi and are responsible for absorbing nutrients such as carbohydrates, proteins, fats, vitamins, and minerals.

      },
      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: A) Cholecystokinin Explanation: CCK primarily stimulates the contraction of the gallbladder, which releases stored bile into the duodenum to aid in fat digestion. It also enhances pancreatic enzyme secretion. However, CCK does not directly regulate the synthesis of bile in the liver. Regulation of Bile: Hormonal Regulation Secretin (Option B) : Stimulates the secretion of a watery, bicarbonate-rich solution by epithelial cells in the bile ducts. Cholecystokinin (CCK) : Induces gallbladder contraction and relaxation of the sphincter of Oddi, facilitating the release of concentrated bile into the duodenum in response to fatty foods. Neural Regulation Vagal Stimulation : Promotes weak gallbladder contraction. Enteric Nervous System : Nerve fibres in the intestine stimulate gallbladder motility and secretion. Feedback Regulation It is influenced by the presence of fats and acids in the duodenum. Bile salts are the most potent regulators of Bile synthesis, which is regulated by the feedback mechanism. (Option D) Cholesterol (Option C): Cholesterol is a precursor for bile acids. In the liver, it is converted into primary bile acids (such as cholic acid and chenodeoxycholic acid), which are essential components of bile and are thus involved in bile synthesis.

      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: B) Cholecystokinin (CCK) Explanation: When peptides and fatty acids enter the small intestine, Cholecystokinin (CCK) is the hormone primarily responsible for stimulating the secretion of pancreatic digestive enzymes. Pancreatic secretion is regulated by three key stimuli: Acetylcholine, mainly released from vagal nerve endings in the enteric nervous system, plays a minor role in stimulating both acinar and duct cells. Cholecystokinin (CCK), secreted by the duodenal and upper jejunal mucosa in response to amino acids and fatty acids, is the primary stimulus for acinar cells to produce enzymes. Secretin, secreted by the duodenal and jejunal mucosa in response to acidic food in the small intestine, is the most important stimulus for duct cells to produce bicarbonate. Pancreatic Digestive Enzymes: Pancreatic secretion contains multiple enzymes for digesting all of the three major types of food (proteins, carbohydrates, fats) Proteins: Trypsin, chymotrypsin, carboxypolypeptidase Carbohydrates: Pancreatic Amylase Fats: Pancreatic Lipase, Cholesterol Esterase, Phospholipase Acidity Regulation: Bicarbonate Reference: Guyton and Hall Textbook of Medical Physiology, 14th Edition, Page 815,816",

      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: B) Gastric Phase Explanation: This patient's symptoms of heartburn and bloating after meals, exacerbated by large or spicy foods, suggest excessive gastric acid production. The Gastric phase of secretion accounts for about 60% of total gastric secretion. Phases of Gastric secretion: Cephalic Phase Trigger: Initiated by sensory stimuli such as sight, smell, thought, or taste of food. Origin: Neurogenic signals originate in the cerebral cortex, amygdala, and hypothalamus and are transmitted via vagus nerves to stimulate gastric secretion. Contribution: Accounts for approximately 30% of gastric secretion Associated with meal anticipation and preparation. Gastric Phase Trigger: Begins when food enters the stomach. Mechanisms: Long vasovagal reflexes between the stomach and brain. Local enteric reflexes within the stomach. Gastrin release, which stimulates gastric juice secretion. Duration: It lasts several hours while food remains in the stomach. Contribution: Accounts for about 60% of total gastric secretion. Intestinal phase Trigger: Initiated by food reaching the duodenum of the small intestine. Mechanism: Small amounts of gastrin released by duodenal mucosa continue to stimulate gastric juice secretion. Contribution: Contributes to approximately 10% of the total acid response to a meal, ensuring continued digestive support as food progresses through the digestive tract.

      },
      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: C) Histamine Explanation: Histamine increases gastric acid secretion by acting on H2 receptors in the parietal cells of the stomach. Regulation of gastric acid secretion: 1. Histamine : It is released from the stomach's enterochromaffin-like (ECL) cells and binds to H2 receptors on parietal cells. This activates the Gs protein, raising cAMP levels and activating protein kinase A (PKA), which enhances the proton pump activity and increases gastric acid secretion. 2. Acetylcholine: It is released from the vagus nerve and acts on M3 receptors of parietal cells. This interaction activates the Gq protein, leading to an increase in intracellular calcium. The rise in calcium activates protein kinase C (PKC) and calmodulin, which stimulate the proton pump, increasing acid secretion. 3. Gastrin: It is produced by G cells in the stomach's antrum and binds to CCK-B2 receptors on parietal and Enterochromaffin (ECL) cells. On parietal cells, this activates the Gq protein, raising intracellular calcium levels and activating protein kinase C (PKC), which stimulates the proton pump, increasing acid secretion. Gastrin stimulates ECL cells to release histamine, further enhancing acid secretion.

      "explanation": "Correct Answer: C) Secretin Explanation: Secretin is released from the S cells in response to acid and fat in the duodenum and is responsible for bicarbonate secretion in the GIT. Functions: Pepsin secretion - helps in protein digestion (patient is suffering from indigestion because of deficiency of this function) Pancreatic and biliary bicarbonate secretion - neutralises the acid in the duodenum Stimulates hepatic ductal secretion Growth of exocrine pancreas Inhibition of gastrin release and direct gastric acid secretion It also inhibits gastric emptying and small intestinal motility.

      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: B) Contraction of sphincter of Oddi Explanation: Cholecystokinin is the major stimulus for gallbladder emptying and pancreatic enzyme secretion; thus, it causes relaxation of the sphincter of Oddi. Effects of Cholecystokinin on GI motility: Inhibition of gastric motility (Option A) . Contraction of pyloric sphincter (Option D) . This allows adequate time for the fatty food in the upper SI to get emulsified and digested. Stimulation of gallbladder emptying. This expels bile into the small intestine, helping to emulsify fat and aid in fat digestion. Relaxation of sphincter of Oddi. Stimulation of intestinal peristalsis (Option C) .

      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: A) Bicarbonate ions Explanation: Cholecystokinin causes the release of pancreatic enzymes and not electrolytes, i.e. bicarbonate. Pancreatic secretion of bicarbonate is stimulated by Secretin and not by CCK. Pancreatic secretion is regulated by 3 basic stimuli: Acetylcholine : Released from the vagus nerve and other cholinergic nerves in the enteric system. Cholecystokinin : Released from the duodenum and upper jejunal mucosa when food enters the duodenum. Secretin : Released by duodenal and upper jejunal mucosa when acidic food enters the duodenum. Actions of CCK: Stimulation of Pancreatic enzyme secretion-Amylase, Lipase and Trypsinogen (Options B, C & D) Growth of exocrine pancreas. Gallbladder contraction. Relaxation of sphincter of Oddi.

      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: C) Acidic chyme entering the duodenum Explanation: Secretin's release is primarily triggered by the low pH (high acidity) of the chyme. Acidic chyme (pH < 4.5) enters the duodenum → S cells in duodenal mucosa detect low pH → Secretin is released into the bloodstream. Stimulus for Secretin and CCK: Hormones Stimuli Secretin Primary: Acidic chyme entering the duodenum (pH < 4.5) Secondary: Fatty acids in the duodenum Peptides Cholecystokinin (CCK) Partially digested proteins (peptides) Fatty acids in the small intestine.

      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: C) Elevated gastrin levels Explanation: Pernicious anaemia is an autoimmune condition in which the body produces antibodies against parietal cells. These cells in the stomach produce intrinsic factors and hydrochloric acid. In pernicious anaemia, gastrin levels are typically severely elevated, often 10-20 times the normal range. Clinical implications: Severely elevated gastrin levels cause hyperplasia of enterochromaffin-like cells in the stomach, which can potentially progress to gastric carcinoid tumours in some cases.",
