      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: C) Pulmonary stretch receptors Explanation: Hering and Breuer in 1868 found that lung inflation decreases tidal volume and increases respiratory frequency. There are two Hering- Breuer reflexes: Hering-Breuer inflation & deflation reflexes. Hering-Breuer inflation reflex: Steady increase in lung volume (lung inflation) results in an increase in the duration of expiration. Receptors: Slowly adapting Marked inflation of the lungs with sustained pressure may even abruptly terminate inspiration in progress, prolonging expiration. Hering-Breuer deflation reflex: Marked deflation of the lung results in a decrease in expiration duration. As described above, the receptors are slowly adapting stretch receptors in the lung parenchyma and airways, and the vagus nerve provides the afferent and efferent pathways. Significance of Hering-Breuer Reflex: It protects the lung from overinflation while marinating normal alveolar ventilation. It is more useful in infants than in adults. It controls tidal volume during eupnea (normal breathing) in infants. This reflex does not operate in adults unless the tidal volume is much greater than the normal inspiration. Especially in the awake state in adults, this reflex is overwhelmed by more prominent central control.

      "explanation": "apnea. Correct Answer: C) The person will experience increased alveolar and arterial PCO I , preventing apnea. Explanation: Physiological Change Description Increase in Alveolar CO I Inhalation of 5% CO I increases the alveoli's partial pressure of CO I (PCO I ). Elevated alveolar PCO I leads to an increase in arterial PCO I . Stimulation of Ventilation A rise in arterial PCO I stimulates the medullary chemoreceptors. This results in an increase in ventilation (hyperventilation continues) to eliminate excess CO I . Avoidance of Apnea Without additional CO I , hyperventilation-induced hypocapnia can lead to apnea (temporary cessation of breathing). Inhaling 5% CO I prevents a significant drop in arterial PCO I , avoiding apnea. Maintaining Blood pH Inhaled CO I helps maintain blood pH closer to normal by preventing respiratory alkalosis. This balance is crucial to avoid adverse effects on cellular and enzymatic functions. New Equilibrium A new equilibrium is established with slightly elevated alveolar and arterial PCO I . The person continues to hyperventilate as long as CO I is inhaled.",

      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "IIIIII Correct Answer: B) 3, 1, 2, 5, 4 Explanation: Reduced K + Conductance : Under hypoxic conditions, the reduced oxygen levels lead to decreased conductance of potassium (K+) channels in the glomus cell membrane. This is due to the hypoxia causing the K+ channels to close or become less active. Depolarisation : The reduced K+ conductance decreases K+ efflux, resulting in the depolarisation of the glomus cell membrane. This change in membrane potential makes the inside of the cell less negative. Calcium Influx : Depolarisation opens voltage-gated L-type calcium (Ca 2+ ) channels, allowing calcium ions to flow into the cell. The influx of Ca 2+ further depolarises the cell and initiates intracellular signalling. Dopamine Release : The increased intracellular Ca 2+ triggers the release of neurotransmitters, such as dopamine, from the glomus cell. Dopamine is released into the synaptic cleft of the afferent nerve endings. Increased Ventilation : Dopamine acts on the central nervous system by binding to D2 receptors in the medulla oblongata. This signalling increases respiratory drive and ventilation (breathing rate and depth). Reference: Ganong's Review of Medical Physiology, 26th Edition, Page 648",

      },
      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: A) Increased ventilation Explanation: Decreased arterial blood pressure leads to increased ventilation by central and peripheral chemoreceptors. Peripheral Chemoreceptors Central Chemoreceptors Pathway Decreased arterial pressure → decreased perfusion of peripheral tissues, including the carotid and aortic bodies → hypoxia (decreased oxygen levels) → stimulation of peripheral chemoreceptors. Decreased arterial pressure → reduced removal of carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) → CO 2 retention → increased arterial P CO2 → increased concentration of hydrogen ions (H + ) in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) due to the conversion of CO 2 to HCO 3 - and H + → stimulation of central chemoreceptors in the medulla. Result The peripheral chemoreceptors send signals to the respiratory centres in the brainstem to increase the rate and depth of breathing to improve oxygen delivery and restore homeostasis. The central chemoreceptors also stimulate the respiratory centres to enhance ventilation, thereby increasing the elimination of CO 2 and improving blood gas levels. This dual mechanism ensures that the body responds promptly to a drop in arterial blood pressure by increasing ventilation, thereby improving oxygenation and CO 2 clearance to maintain physiological balance. Decreased ventilation (Option B) – Incorrect, as hypoxia and hypotension trigger compensatory mechanisms to increase, not decrease, ventilation. No effect at all (Option C) – Incorrect, as the body responds to hypotension with increased respiratory drive via chemoreceptor activation. Depends on the temperature (Option D) – Incorrect, as ventilation regulation is primarily controlled by blood gases and pH, not temperature.

      "explanation": "Correct Answer: A) Cerebral cortex Explanation: The cerebral cortex is the outermost layer of the brain, involved in various higher-order brain functions such as sensation, voluntary muscle movement, thought, reasoning, and memory. The primary motor cortex, located in the precentral gyrus of the frontal lobe, plays a key role in voluntary movements, including the voluntary control of breathing. The voluntary control of respiration originates in the motor cortex and involves the corticospinal tract. This pathway directly sends signals from the cerebral cortex to the spinal cord, bypassing the brainstem respiratory centres. Through this pathway, individuals can consciously control their breathing, such as holding their breath, taking a deep breath, or altering the breathing pattern during speech and singing. While the brainstem (specifically the medulla and pons) is primarily responsible for the automatic, rhythmic breathing pattern, the cerebral cortex can override these automatic signals when exercising voluntary control. This voluntary control is critical during activities requiring conscious modulation of breathing, such as talking, singing, playing wind instruments, or deliberate breath-holding. Reference: G.

      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: B) Pneumotaxic center Explanation: The apneustic center sends signals to the dorsal respiratory group to initiates and prolongs inspiration but Pneumotaxic center inhibits the apneustic center ,ends inspiration & begins passive expiration .Thus pneumotaxic center modulates depth of breathing.
