      "explanation": "Correct Answer: B) DHPR activates RyR to release calcium from the sarcoplasmic reticulum. This change directly activates RyR, the calcium release channel on the sarcoplasmic reticulum, leading to the release of calcium ions into the cytoplasm, which is crucial for muscle contraction. Sarcotubular System: The Sarcotubular system is composed of the L tubule and T tubule . The T-tubule contains a L-type voltage gated Calcium channel, known as the DHPR (dihydropyridine receptor channel). The L-tubule contains a calcium channel known as RyR ryanodine receptor channel). DHPR activates, not inhibits, RyR to facilitate calcium release during muscle contraction. (Option A) The reuptake of calcium into the sarcoplasmic reticulum is performed by the SERCA pump, not by RyR.

      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "during various phases of muscle activity. Correct Answer: C) Resting heat is produced at rest; activation, shortening, and relaxation heat during various phases of muscle activity. Explanation: Types of heat generated during muscle contraction and relaxation: Resting Heat: Resting heat refers to the heat produced by the muscle at rest. It is generated by the basal metabolic processes that occur in the muscle even when it is not actively contracting. Activation Heat: Activation heat is generated at the onset of muscle contraction. This heat results from the initial metabolic processes that prepare the muscle fibers for contraction, including the breakdown of ATP and the activation of the contractile machinery. Shortening Heat: Shortening heat is produced during the actual shortening of the muscle fibers. This occurs as the muscle generates force and performs work, converting chemical energy into mechanical energy and heat. Relaxation Heat: Relaxation heat is generated as the muscle returns to its resting state after contraction. This phase involves processes such as the re-synthesis of ATP, the re-establishment of ion gradients, and the removal of metabolic byproducts. Resting heat is not produced during relaxation. It is the heat generated by the muscle at rest, due to basal metabolic activities. Activation heat is correctly associated with the contraction phase. (Option A) Activation heat is not produced during relaxation; it occurs at the onset of contraction. Shortening heat is not generated during rest; it is produced when muscle fibers actively shorten during contraction. (Option B) Shortening heat is not produced during rest. Relaxation heat is not generated during contraction; it occurs during the relaxation phase as the muscle returns to its resting state.

      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "muscle generates maximal tension at slightly shorter lengths. Correct Answer: B) Skeletal muscle generates maximal tension at near resting length, while cardiac muscle generates maximal tension at slightly longer lengths. Explanation: Skeletal muscle generates maximal tension when sarcomere length is near resting length (about 2.0 to 2.2 micrometers), while cardiac muscle generates maximal tension at slightly longer lengths due to the rising part of the active tension curve , which allows for greater force production as the heart fills with more blood. In skeletal muscle, the operating point is at the plateau of the active tension curve , where maximal tension is achieved at resting length. In cardiac muscle, the operating point is on the rising part of the active tension curve , allowing room for additional stretching and increased force production. (Option A) Skeletal muscle tension decreases sharply if the sarcomere length deviates significantly from its optimal range. Cardiac muscle, due to its basket-weave fiber arrangement and early starting passive tension curve, is adapted to maintain near-maximal tension over a range of sarcomere lengths, crucial for its function in varying blood volumes. (Option C) Both muscle types lose tension if sarcomere lengths are significantly altered from their optimal range. However, cardiac muscle’s passive tension curve starts earlier, and its fibers’ basket-weave pattern allows it to recoil with significant force, enabling it to maintain function over a broader range of lengths compared to skeletal muscle.

      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "sarcomere length exceeds 2.2 µ m. Correct Answer: B) The number of cross-bridges and tension generated decrease when the sarcomere length exceeds 2.2 µ m. Explanation: The length-tension relationship in skeletal muscle: Optimal Length: The sarcomere length that produces maximum tension is between 2.0 and 2.2 µ m. (Option B ruled out) Cross-Bridge Formation: Tension is greatest at this optimal length because cross-bridge formation between actin and myosin filaments is maximized. Short Sarcomere Length: When sarcomeres are shorter than optimal, excessive overlap of actin filaments limits cross-bridge formation, reducing tension. Long Sarcomere Length: When sarcomeres are longer than optimal, cross-bridge formation decreases as actin and myosin filaments overlap less, leading to reduced tension. Maximum Stretch: At lengths around 3.6 µ m, the sarcomere can rupture due to excessive stretching. (Option D ruled out) Passive Tension: Passive tension in muscle is the force generated by the stretching of the muscle's connective tissue structures. It arises due to the elasticity of the muscle's structural components, such as the titin protein, which resists excessive stretching. Passive tension increases as the muscle is stretched beyond its optimal sarcomere length, contributing to the total tension experienced by the muscle. While it is true that passive tension contributes to the total muscle tension at all lengths, option C is misleading because it implies that passive tension is a significant contributor even when the sarcomere length is optimal (2.0 to 2.2 µ m). The primary focus of the optimal length is on the maximal active tension generated by cross-bridge interactions, not the passive elastic properties of the muscle.

      "explanation": "Correct Answer: B) Depletion of ATP prevents the detachment of myosin heads from actin filaments. after a power stroke. In the absence of ATP, myosin heads remain bound to actin, leading to a state of continuous contraction, which is observed as muscle stiffness in rigor mortis. This process begins several hours after death and continues until muscle proteins begin to decompose. Cross Bridge Formation: Calcium ions play a crucial role in initiating muscle contraction by binding to troponin, which allows myosin to bind to actin. However, rigor mortis occurs due to the lack of ATP, which is necessary for the detachment of myosin from actin after contraction. (Option A) Lactic acid accumulation in muscles is typically associated with anaerobic metabolism during vigorous exercise, leading to muscle fatigue and soreness. (Option C) Degradation of muscle proteins leads to the eventual resolution of rigor mortis, not its onset. As the body decomposes, proteolytic enzymes break down muscle proteins, leading to the relaxation of the muscles and the end of rigor mortis. (Option D)",

Binding of calcium ions to troponin C Calcium ions bind to troponin C on the thin filaments, causing a conformational change in the troponin complex. Cross-bridge formation between myosin and actin The conformational change in the troponin complex moves tropomyosin away from the myosin-binding sites on actin, allowing the myosin heads (with ADP and Pi bound) to attach to the exposed binding sites on actin. Power stroke, moving the myosin head from 90 degrees to 45 degrees The myosin head pivots from a 90-degree angle to a 45-degree angle, pulling the actin filament toward the center of the sarcomere. ADP and Pi are released during this movement. Detachment of the myosin head from actin A new ATP molecule binds to the myosin head, causing it to detach from the actin filament.

      "explanation": "influx during the plateau phase of the action potential. Correct Answer: C) Extracellular calcium entry through T-tubule membrane contributes significantly to calcium influx during the plateau phase of the action potential. Explanation: Unlike skeletal muscle, cardiac T-tubules are open to the extracellular space, allowing extracellular calcium influx during the plateau phase of the action potential. This influx is critical for sustaining calcium levels necessary for prolonged contraction in cardiac muscle. This phenomenon is stated as Calcium-induced calcium release. CONTRACTION IN CARDIAC MUSCLE T-tubules are present in both cardiac and skeletal muscle , and they are essential for transmitting the action potential into the interior of the muscle fiber (Option C) Calcium-induced calcium release in cardiac muscle involves both voltage-gated calcium channels in the T-tubules and ryanodine receptors on the SR membrane (Option C) Relaxation of cardiac muscle is primarily initiated by the removal of calcium ions from the cytoplasm, facilitated by the sarcoplasmic reticulum calcium ATPase (SERCA) , and not by potassium binding to troponin (Option D) Reference: Guyton and Hall - Textbook of Medical Physiology,14th Edition, Page 114-117",

        "A": "ATP binding to myosin heads",
        "B": "Depolarization of T-tubules",

      },
      "correct_answer": "D",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: D) Conformational change in troponin complex Explanation: The conformational change in the troponin complex occurs in response to elevated cytoplasmic calcium ions (Ca² I ), which bind to troponin. This causes tropomyosin to move away from the myosin-binding sites on actin filaments, allowing myosin heads to bind with Myosin binding sites of actin and initiate muscle contraction. CONTRACTION OF SKELETAL MUSCLE: ATP binding allows myosin heads to detach from actin filaments during muscle relaxation, not contraction. (Option A) Depolarization of T-tubules allows for the propagation of the action potential into the muscle fiber but does not directly expose myosin-binding sites on actin filaments. (Option B) Binding of acetylcholine (ACh) to muscle fiber receptors initiates muscle fiber depolarization but does not directly expose myosin-binding sites on actin filaments.

      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: A) Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy Explanation: The progressive muscle weakness, difficulty walking, and frequent falls starting at age 5 , along with calf hypertrophy, a positive Gower’s sign, and elevated creatine kinase , are classic findings of Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) . Genetic testing confirms a dystrophin gene mutation leading to complete absence of dystrophin , which is a characteristic finding Becker Muscular Dystrophy (BMD) (Option B) also involves mutations in the dystrophin gene but usually presents later (adolescence or adulthood) with a slower progression and milder symptoms. Calf hypertrophy can be seen in both BMD and DMD, but the overall course and severity of BMD are milder. Emery-Dreifuss Muscular Dystrophy (EDMD) (Option C) often presents with early contractures, cardiac involvement (conduction defects, arrhythmias), and humeroperoneal muscle weakness. It does not typically involve calf hypertrophy and has a different pattern of muscle weakness compared to DMD. Facioscapulohumeral Muscular Dystrophy (FSHD) (Option D) primarily affects the muscles of the face, shoulders, and upper arms. It usually presents in adolescence or early adulthood with a distinct pattern of muscle weakness that spares the lower limbs until later stages.

It plays a critical role in maintaining the structural integrity of muscle cells by linking the internal cytoskeleton to the extracellular matrix.The progressive muscle weakness, difficulty with climbing stairs and lifting objects, and absence of a key sarcolemmal protein on biopsy suggest Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy (DMD), which is caused by the absence of dystrophin . Myosin (Option B) and Actin (Option C) are essential contractile proteins within the muscle fibers themselves, not specifically associated with the sarcolemma. Troponin (Option D) is a regulatory protein complex involved in muscle contraction but is located within the muscle fiber, not at the sarcolemma.
