Correct Answer: D) Electrocorticography (ECOG) is the measurement of electrical activity, specifically in the cerebral cortex, by placing electrodes over the scalp . Explanation: Electrocorticography (ECOG) involves placing electrodes directly on the cerebral cortex , not over the scalp. It is an invasive procedure requiring craniotomy. It is used to evaluate epileptogenic foci in patients with refractory epilepsy. Electroencephalogram - EEG Electroencephalogram (EEG) is the record of spontaneous electrical activities generated in the cerebral cortex that are picked up from the brain's surface through electrodes placed on designated sites in the scalp. (Option B ruled out) It detects the dendritic potentials of neurons, primarily pyramidal cells reaching the surface of the scalp. Positive dendritic potential is known as EPSP (Excitatory Postsynaptic Potential), and negative dendritic potential is known as IPSP (Inhibitory postsynaptic potential).

      "explanation": "Correct Answer: C) Decreased levels of adenosine at basal forebrain stimulate the sleep-promotion. wakefulness, primarily adenosine. As adenosine accumulates, it activates sleep-promoting areas in the brain. Metabolic Theory There are 2 centres located in the hypothalamus, which are in constant mutual inhibition. Wake-Promoting Area: Located in the posterior hypothalamus- Tuberomammillary nucleus (TMN), releasing histamine. (Option A ruled out) The wake-promoting area stimulates two important nuclei of the reticular activating system, i.e., Raphe nuclei (RN) , which produce serotonin , and Locus coeruleus (LC) , which produce non-epinephrine . These act at the level of the thalamus from which all the diffuse projections will reach the cortex and the active cortex means the person will remain awake. This active cortex indefinitely produces metabolites with awakeness, primarily Adenosine . An increase in adenosine acts at the level of the basal forebrain and stimulates the sleep-promoting area. Sleep-Promoting Area: Located in the anterior hypothalamus- Ventrolateral preoptic nucleus (VLPO), releasing GABA.

Nocturnal enuresis: Occurs in stages 3/4. Common in childhood, due to the failure of neural regulation of micturition. Stage 1 & 2 NREM Sleep Talking (Somniloquy): This can occur in any stage of sleep but is most common in stages 1 and 2 of NREM sleep. Bruxism (Teeth Grinding): Primarily occurs during stage 2 of NREM sleep. The transition from stage 3 to 4 NREM Night Terrors: Typically occur during the transition from stage 3 to stage 4 of NREM sleep. Unlike nightmares, individuals usually do not remember night terrors. REM Sleep Narcolepsy: Involves sudden onset of REM sleep. Individuals with narcolepsy often experience excessive daytime sleepiness, sudden muscle weakness (cataplexy), sleep paralysis, and hallucinations at the onset or end of sleep. The disorder is linked to a deficiency in the neurotransmitter orexin . Nightmares: Occur during REM sleep and involve vivid, disturbing dreams that can cause fear and anxiety. Unlike night terrors, nightmares are often remembered in detail upon waking. They can be triggered by stress, anxiety, or trauma. Reference: 1. G.K.

      "question": "A 55-year-old patient presents with complaints of memory issues. He can recall general knowledge about the world, such as facts about historical events, but has difficulty remembering personal experiences, such as what he had for dinner last night or his activities from last weekend. Based on these symptoms, which of the following best describes the types of explicit memory affected in this patient?",

        "D": "Intact procedural memory with impaired working memory"
      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: B) Intact semantic memory with impaired episodic memory Explanation: The patient is able to recall general knowledge and facts about the world (intact semantic memory) but struggles to remember specific personal experiences such as what he had for dinner or activities from last weekend (impaired episodic memory). This distinction is consistent with the described symptoms and aligns with the known functions of semantic and episodic memory. Explicit memory , also known as declarative memory, is a type of long-term memory that involves conscious recollection of information. It is divided into two main categories: Semantic Memory : This refers to the storage of general knowledge about the world. It includes facts, concepts, and ideas that are not tied to specific personal experiences. For instance, knowing that the capital of France is Paris, understanding the rules of mathematics, or recognizing historical dates and events are all parts of semantic memory. The temporal lobes , particularly the anterior and lateral temporal cortex , are critically involved in the processing and storage of semantic memory. Episodic Memory : This involves the recollection of personal experiences and specific events that have occurred at particular times and places. It includes memories of one's own life, such as what you had for dinner last night, a vacation you took last summer, or a conversation you had with a friend. The hippocampus and adjacent medial temporal lobe structures are essential for the formation and retrieval of episodic memories. The patient’s difficulty in remembering what he had for dinner or his activities from the previous weekend suggests an impairment in episodic memory. (Option A ruled out) Procedural memory is a type of implicit memory related to the performance of tasks, such as riding a bike or playing an instrument. Working memory is a short-term memory system involved in the temporary storage and manipulation of information. The patient's symptoms do not relate to procedural memory or working memory issues but rather to long-term explicit memory.

      },
      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: A) Procedural memory Explanation: Implicit memory , also known as non-declarative memory, involves unconscious memory processes that influence thoughts and behaviors. Implicit memory is divided into following subcategories: Procedural Memory : This type of implicit memory involves the learning and retention of motor skills and actions. It enables individuals to perform tasks without conscious thought, such as riding a bicycle, typing on a keyboard, or playing a musical instrument. (Option A) Priming : ( option B ) Priming refers to the unconscious influence that exposure to a stimulus has on a subsequent response to a different stimulus. It helps with faster recognition or processing of similar stimuli without conscious awareness. For example, seeing the word \"yellow\" might make it easier to recognize the word \"banana\" shortly afterward. (Option B ruled out) Associative Learning : ( option C) This type of learning involves forming connections between two stimuli or between a stimulus and a response. It includes: (Option C ruled out) Classical Conditioning : A process where a neutral stimulus becomes associated with a significant stimulus, resulting in a learned response. For example, Pavlov’s dogs learned to salivate at the sound of a bell because it was associated with food. Operant Conditioning : A type of learning where behavior is strengthened or weakened by rewards or punishments. For example, a rat learning to press a lever to receive food involves operant conditioning. Non-Associative Learning : This involves changes in the strength of a response to a single stimulus due to repeated exposure. It includes: Habituation : A decrease in response to a repeated, benign stimulus. For instance, becoming accustomed to a constant background noise and eventually ignoring it. Sensitisation : An increased response to a stimulus following a strong or noxious stimulus. For example, becoming more sensitive to a light touch after being exposed to a painful stimulus. Semantic memory (Option D) is a type of explicit memory that involves the storage and recall of factual information and general knowledge, such as knowing the capital of a country or understanding historical events. The patient's difficulties with motor tasks and learning new skills are not related to semantic memory. Reference: Ganong’s Review of Medical Physiology, 26th Edition, Page. 280",

        "D": "Habituation"
      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: B) Operant conditioning Explanation: Operant conditioning involves learning through the consequences of behaviors . In this type of learning, behaviors are either reinforced (strengthened) or punished (weakened) based on their consequences. B.F. Skinner's experiments with rats in Skinner boxes demonstrated this concept. Skinner’s experiment: In the experiment, a rat is placed in a chamber with an electrical grid on the floor and multiple switches on the wall. The rat learns that pressing one switch results in an electric shock, while pressing another switch or lever results in food dropping into the box. Over time, the rat associates pressing the food switch with receiving food, reinforcing this behavior. Meanwhile, the association with the electric shock stimulus diminishes in the rat's memory. Thus, the rat associates with the stimulus to change the behaviour. Classical conditioning (Option A) is associative learning, where an organism learns to associate two stimuli. Observational learning (Option C): Observational learning, described by Albert Bandura, involves learning by observing others and their consequences. While observational learning can lead to behaviour modification, it focuses more on social learning and modelling rather than direct reinforcement or punishment. Habituation (Option D) is a form of non-associative learning where an organism decreases its response to a repeated stimulus that carries no positive or negative consequences. It does not involve learning through consequences or behavioural modification.",

      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: A) Prefrontal cortex Explanation: Working memory is a type of short-term memory. It typically lasts for about 18-20 seconds before information may fade without rehearsal. The maximum capacity of working memory is around 7±2 'chunks' of information, such as items like fruits or numbers. The prefrontal cortex is the brain region primarily responsible for working memory. (Option A) Short-term memory: Short-term memory retains information for durations ranging from seconds to several hours. The ventral hippocampus , specifically the CA1 region, is responsible for short-term memory. (Option C ruled out) Through rehearsal or repetition, short-term memories can be consolidated into long-term memories. Long-term memory: Long-term memory retains information for years or even a lifetime. The neocortex serves as the centre for long-term memory storage. (Option B ruled out) Amygdala (Option D): The amygdala is primarily involved in emotional processing and the formation of emotional memories. Although it interacts with memory systems, it does not handle working memory, which is more closely linked to the prefrontal cortex. Reference: 1.

      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "postsynaptic neuron. Correct Answer: B) Long-Term Depression (LTD) involves a significant influx of calcium into the postsynaptic neuron. Explanation: A significant influx of calcium into the postsynaptic neuron is seen in the process of Long-term potentiation strengthening the synapse. Mechanism of memory formation: Memory formation relies on synaptic plasticity , which refers to the strengthening or weakening of synapses based on neuronal activity. Long-term potentiation: Long-term potentiation (LTP), a mechanism for memory formation, involves the strengthening of synapses, particularly in the hippocampus (CA1) and cerebellum It primarily occurs at glutamatergic synapses in the hippocampus. (Option A ruled out) Two key glutamate receptors, AMPA and NMDA, are involved in LTP. Glutamate binding to the AMPA receptor causes an influx of sodium ions (Na+) into the postsynaptic neuron, leading to depolarisation. NMDA Receptor and Calcium Influx: The depolarization caused by AMPA receptor activation is crucial as it removes a magnesium ion (Mg2+) block from the NMDA receptor channel. This removal is key because Mg2+ normally prevents calcium ions (Ca2+) from entering the postsynaptic neuron. Calcium's Role: This influx of Ca2+ initiates a cascade of events. Firstly, Ca2+ binds with calmodulin, forming a complex that activates kinase enzymes. Kinase Activity and AMPA Receptor Phosphorylation: Kinases then phosphorylates various proteins, notably the AMPA receptor itself. Phosphorylation keeps the AMPA receptor open even after the initial stimulation ceases, leading to increased sensitivity and a strengthened synapse. (Option C ruled out) Long-term depression: Long-Term Depression (LTD) is a process that weakens synapses LTD involves a smaller influx of calcium ions (Ca2+) compared to LTP. Metabotropic glutamate receptors are involved in LTD, unlike the NMDA receptors in LTP. These metabotropic receptors, when activated by glutamate, lead to a low influx of Ca2+ into the postsynaptic neuron. This smaller influx is crucial for initiating LTD. Phosphatase enzymes are activated in LTD due to the low Ca2+ concentration. This contrasts with LTP, where a high Ca2+ concentration activates kinase enzymes. Phosphatase activity results in the dephosphorylation of AMPA receptors, leading to their closure. (Option D ruled out) The closure of AMPA receptors inhibits the synapse, making it less responsive to stimuli. LTD, therefore, serves to weaken specific synapses, potentially filtering out irrelevant information while strengthening relevant ones through LTP.",
