      "explanation": "volume of blood ejected by the heart into the aorta per minute. Several methods are used to measure CO, each with its own principle and considerations. Key Measurement Methods Method Principle Measurement Basis Key Considerations Additional Details Fick Principle Oxygen uptake and arteriovenous difference Oxygen content in blood Accurate in steady states Cardiac output = Oxygen Consumption / (Arterial Oxygen Content - Venous Oxygen Content) Indicator Dilution Method Indicator concentration dilution Injected dye or tracer Requires precise indicator handling Measures dilution of an injected dye/tracer over time to calculate cardiac output. Echocardiogram Ultrasound visualization and flow velocity Stroke volume estimation Non-invasive, real-time data Estimates stroke volume from blood velocity, multiplied by heart rate for CO calculation. Thermodilution Temperature change due to injected fluid Pulmonary artery catheter insertion Gold-standard, ideal for high cardiac output states Measures temperature change in the pulmonary artery after injecting cold fluid. Velocity Encoded MRI Magnetic resonance imaging and velocity encoding Blood flow velocity Non-invasive, requires advanced equipment Uses MRI to measure blood flow velocity for cardiac output estimation. Impedance Cardiography Electrical impedance changes Thoracic impedance fluctuations Sensitive to external factors Measures electrical impedance across the thorax to calculate cardiac output.

      "question": "Which of the following jugular venous pressure (JVP) waves corresponds to the isovolumetric contraction phase of the cardiac cycle?",
      "options": {
        "A": "A wave",
        "B": "C wave",
        "C": "X descent",
        "D": "Y descent"
      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "various phases of the cardiac cycle. The C wave of the JVP represents the isovolumetric contraction phase of the cardiac cycle. It occurs during early ventricular systole, as the tricuspid valve bulges into the right atrium due to rising pressure in the right ventricle. This transient bulging causes a slight increase in the JVP. Jugular Venous Pressure (JVP) Waveform a wave (Option A ruled out) Caused by atrial systole. Atrial contraction results in a temporary halt in venous inflow. Some blood flows back into the veins, causing a rise in venous pressure. c wave Arises from the increase in atrial pressure during isovolumetric ventricular contraction. Pressure is transmitted through the closed and bulging tricuspid valve. x descent (Option C ruled out) Ventricular systole pulls the tricuspid valve down v wave Corresponds to the rise in atrial pressure as blood fills the atria. Occurs during diastole while the tricuspid valve is still closed. y descent (Option D ruled out) Opening of tricuspid valve causing emptying of right atrium into ventricle Reference: Ganong’s Review of Medical Physiology, Edition 26, Pg 531",

      "question": "The stroke volume depends on end-diastolic volume. This is best represented as?",

        "A": "Length–weight relationship",
        "B": "Length–velocity relationship",
        "C": "Length-tension relationship",
        "D": "Length-viscosity relationship"
      },
      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "by the end-diastolic volume (EDV) , which determines the degree of ventricular stretch before contraction. This is explained by the Frank-Starling law of the heart , which states that the force of contraction increases with greater ventricular filling (EDV) due to increased sarcomere stretch. The length–tension relationship describes how the initial length of cardiac muscle fibers (determined by EDV) affects the tension they can generate during contraction, which directly impacts stroke volume. The Frank-Starling law: It describes the relationship between the volume of blood filling the heart (end-diastolic volume) and the force of contraction during the next heartbeat (stroke volume) . Mechanism: Preload: Increased venous return leads to increased end-diastolic volume. Myocardial Stretch: Greater end-diastolic volume stretches the myocardial fibers. Force of Contraction: The stretched fibers generate a more forceful contraction due to the optimal overlap of actin and myosin filaments (length-tension relationship).

      "question": "Arrange the following in the sequence in which they occur, after the 'p wave' in ECG: A- 'a' wave B- 1st heart sound C- Rapid filling of ventricles D- 't' wave",
      "options": {
        "A": "ABCD",

        "C": "CABD",
        "D": "ACBD"
      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "A. 'a' wave: The 'a' wave represents atrial contraction. It occurs during atrial systole when the atria contract to push blood into the ventricles. B. 1st heart sound: The 1st heart sound, also known as S1, is the closure of the atrioventricular (AV) valves (mitral and tricuspid valves) at the beginning of ventricular systole. It marks the onset of ventricular contraction. D. 't' wave: The 't' wave is a repolarization phase of the ventricles. It represents the relaxation and resetting of the ventricles after contraction. C. Rapid filling of ventricles: After the 't' wave, the ventricles enter the diastole phase, during which they passively fill with blood from the atria. This is known as rapid ventricular filling. Therefore, the correct sequence is ABDC: 'a' wave, 1 st heart sound, rapid filling of ventricles, and 't' wave. Reference: Ganong’s Review of Medical Physiology, 26th Edition- Page 519, 530, 531",

      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "Correct answer: A) Decrease in firing from baroreceptor Explanation: Baroreceptor Reflex Aspect Details Mechanism Baroreceptors in carotid sinus and aortic arch detect BP changes Increased BP stretches receptors, sending signals to medulla via glossopharyngeal and vagus nerves Medulla inhibits vasoconstrictor center and stimulates vagal parasympathetic center (Option B ruled out) It is a rapid negative feedback loop in which an elevated blood pressure causes the heart rate to decrease. Decreased blood pressure decreases baroreflex activation and causes heart rate to increase and to restore blood pressure levels. (Option A) Actions Vasodilation of blood vessels Decreased heart rate and contraction strength (Option D ruled out) Reduced BP due to lower peripheral resistance and cardiac output Importance Maintains BP stability during activities like standing Fastest acting Tends to reset within 1-2 days for long-term regulation Reflex - Supine to standing\" data-author=\"\" data-hash=\"12135\" data-license=\"\" data-source=\"\" data-tags=\"May2025\" height=\"320\" src=\"https://image.prepladder.com/notes/QLAOdtkOSmvd2OpYr7xO1746516919.png\" width=\"521\" /> Reference: Ganong’s Review of Medical Physiology, 26th Edition, Page 575, 576, 577,578, 579, 582, 583, 585, 586 Guyton and Hall Textbook of Medical Physiology, 14th Edition, Page 221, 222, 229, 236, 243, 244.",
