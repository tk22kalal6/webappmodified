The patient’s long-term use of lithium, a known cause of nephrogenic DI, aligns with the symptoms of polyuria and polydipsia and the laboratory findings of dilute urine. The presence of normal kidney function tests suggests that the primary issue is with ADH action in the kidneys rather than an intrinsic kidney disease. A) Neurogenic DI results from a deficiency of ADH due to problems in the hypothalamus or posterior pituitary. This is not consistent with the patient’s history of lithium use, which is more commonly associated with nephrogenic DI.

      },
      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "Correct answer: A) IGF-I (Somatomedin-C) is the most potent in promoting cell growth and mediating the effects of growth hormone (GH). It plays a crucial role in skeletal and cartilage growth especially during postnatal development. Somatomedins, also known as Insulin-like Growth Factors (IGFs), are polypeptide growth factors primarily produced in the liver, although they are also formed in cartilage and other tissues. These factors play a critical role in mediating the effects of growth hormone (GH) on growth, cartilage, and protein metabolism. The two most important circulating somatomedins in humans are IGF-I (somatomedin C) and IGF-II. Features IGF - I ( Somatomedin C) IGF - II Primary Function Skeletal and cartilage growth Crucial for fetal growth Regulation by GH Strongly regulated after birth Not significantly regulated by GH postnatally Potency More potent in growth promotion Less potent compared to IGF-I Plasma Concentration Mirrors GH secretion Higher concentration than IGF-I Role in Development Important for both fetal and postnatal growth Mainly involved in fetal development IGF-II (Option B) : IGF-II is important for fetal development but is generally less potent than IGF-I in promoting postnatal cell growth. Its actions are not as closely linked to GH regulation as IGF-I. Insulin (Option C) : While insulin shares structural similarities with IGFs and can promote cellular growth and metabolism, it primarily regulates glucose uptake and metabolism rather than directly mediating growth hormone effects. Growth Hormone (GH) (Option D) : Growth Hormone (GH) stimulates the production of IGFs but is not an IGF itself. IGFs, particularly IGF-I, are responsible for directly promoting cell growth.

A) Pituitary adenoma: This could cause elevated GH levels due to tumor overproduction, but the scenario focuses on feedback failure despite high IGF-1. B) Hypothalamic lesion impairing somatostatin release : This would decrease inhibition of GH secretion, potentially leading to elevated GH, but does not explain the elevated IGF-1 levels. D) Excessive GHRH secretion from an ectopic source : While this could increase GH levels, it does not directly address the feedback failure involving IGF-1 mentioned in the scenario. Factors Controlling GH Secretion: Direct Feedback from GH to Hypothalamus: GH can inhibit its production by reducing GHRH secretion from the hypothalamus. Indirect Feedback via IGF-1: GH stimulates the liver to produce IGF-1, which then inhibits GH secretion by acting directly on the pituitary and indirectly by stimulating somatostatin release from the hypothalamus. Negative Feedback through Somatostatin: Somatostatin, a potent inhibitor of GH secretion, is released in response to elevated GH or IGF-1 levels, contributing to the negative feedback loop.",

A) Increased somatostatin secretion : This would typically decrease GH levels, not increase them, as somatostatin inhibits GH release. B) Elevated blood glucose levels : High blood glucose levels are associated with reduced GH secretion, not an increase. D) Reduced ghrelin levels : Ghrelin stimulates GH release, so reduced ghrelin levels would likely lead to a decrease in GH, not an increase. Factors controlling GH secretion and their effects Hypothalamic Control Growth Hormone-Releasing Hormone (GHRH) : Increases GH synthesis and secretion. Somatostatin (GHIH) : Decreases GH secretion. Nutritional Factors Hypoglycemia : Promotes GH secretion to increase blood glucose levels and mobilize energy. Amino Acids : Stimulate GH release, supporting protein synthesis and growth. Starvation or Protein Deficiency : This leads to elevated GH levels to conserve body proteins and utilize fats as an energy source. Physiological Factors Exercise : Enhances GH secretion Sleep : GH surges during deep sleep are vital for growth and tissue repair processes. Stress : Physical and emotional stressors can increase GH secretion Hormonal Factors Ghrelin : Increases GH secretion and stimulates appetite.

      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "from the anterior pituitary, can also increase prolactin secretion. This dual effect may contribute to conditions like galactorrhea when prolactin levels are elevated. The pituitary gland plays a pivotal role in regulating various endocrine functions, including growth, metabolism, and reproduction. The activity of the pituitary gland is primarily governed by the hypothalamus , which releases specific hormones, either stimulating or inhibiting, that reach the pituitary. The regulation of pituitary hormone secretion is a finely tuned process, primarily controlled by feedback mechanisms. Negative feedback loops are the most common, where the end products of a hormone's action inhibit further hormone release to maintain homeostasis. An example is cortisol, which inhibits its own secretion through feedback on both the hypothalamus and pituitary. Positive feedback, although less common, occurs in processes like childbirth, where oxytocin release enhances uterine contractions, leading to further oxytocin release. A) Corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH) : This hormone primarily stimulates the release of adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) from the anterior pituitary, which in turn influences cortisol production by the adrenal glands. CRH does not directly affect prolactin levels. B) Dopamine : This neurotransmitter serves as the primary inhibitor of prolactin secretion. Increased dopamine levels typically decrease prolactin release, the opposite of what is described in the scenario. D) Gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) : This hormone primarily regulates the release of luteinizing hormone (LH) and follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), which are involved in reproductive function.

Aspect Type 1 Receptors Type 2 Receptors Location : Cytoplasm (Option A) Nucleus (Option A) Examples : Glucocorticoid, mineralocorticoid, androgen, and progesterone receptors Thyroid hormone and retinoic acid receptors Activation Mechanism: Inactive State : Bound to chaperone proteins- heat shock proteins (HSPs) like HSP90 Hormone Binding: Causes dissociation from HSPs Dimerization: Forms homodimers (Option C) Nuclear Translocation: Homodimers move to the nucleus and bind to hormone response elements (HREs) on DNA Transcription: Initiates activation of target genes DNA Binding: Can bind DNA even without a ligand, often repressing transcription. The hormone receptor is attached to a molecule RXR which forms a heterodimer. (Option C) Ligand Binding: Enhances or represses transcription depending on coactivators or corepressors Transcriptional Regulation: Modulates gene expression via interaction with HREs (Option D) Both Type 1 and Type 2 receptors do not have intrinsic enzymatic activity. Instead, they function as transcription factors that regulate gene expression in response to hormonal signaling. Reference: Principles of endocrinology Signaling by nuclear receptors",

      "explanation": "dimerization. This leads to the activation of the cytoplasmic kinase domains through trans-phosphorylation, initiating downstream signaling. A) RTKs are activated by hormone binding to the extracellular domain, not by intracellular ligands. C) RTKs do not form ion channels. This mechanism is characteristic of other types of receptors, such as ionotropic receptors. D) RTKs do not directly activate G proteins. This mechanism is associated with G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs), not RTKs. Receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) Enzyme-linked receptors located on cell membranes. Pass through the membrane once; hormone-binding site is extracellular, catalytic site is intracellular. Mechanism of Action: Hormone Binding: Hormone binds to the extracellular part of the RTK. Enzyme Activation: Binding activates or inactivates an intracellular enzyme. Some RTKs have intrinsic enzymatic activity, while others depend on associated enzymes. Example: Leptin Receptor Family: Cytokine receptors. Hormone: Leptin (regulates appetite and energy balance). Associated Enzyme: JAK2 (Janus kinase family). Signaling Process: Dimerization: Leptin binding causes receptor dimerization. Phosphorylation & Conformation Change: Leptin binding alters receptor conformation, phosphorylating the intracellular part of the JAK receptor. Intracellular Signaling: Activated JAK2 phosphorylates tyrosine residues within the receptor-JAK2 complex, activating STAT proteins, which lead to target gene activation and protein synthesis. JAK2 also activates additional pathways, including MAPK and PI3K. Effects: Rapid: Due to activation of the above-said intracellular enzymes. Slower: Requires new protein synthesis.

      "explanation": "domains, leading to cGMP synthesis. B) Phosphorylation within the kinase homology domain (KHD) is important but does not directly activate cGMP synthesis; ligand-induced conformational change is the primary mechanism. C) The intracellular domains of pGCs do not bind to DNA or initiate gene transcription; they are involved in cGMP synthesis. D) While some pGCs are regulated by intracellular proteins, the primary activation mechanism for most pGCs involves ligand binding to the extracellular domain. Guanylyl Cyclase Receptor: Transmembrane guanylyl cyclases (pGCs) are homodimers (~1,050 amino acids each). Composed of a short transmembrane domain (21-25 hydrophobic amino acids) separating extracellular and intracellular regions. Extracellular domain acts as a receptor for specific peptide hormones. Domains: Extracellular Domain: Binds specific ligands. Juxtamembranous Protein Kinase-Homology Domain (KHD): ~250 residues, lacks kinase activity. Cyclase Domain: Catalytic region for cGMP formation at the COOH-terminal end. Activation Mechanism: Ligand Binding: Specific ligands (e.g., ANP) bind, causing a conformational change. Conformational Change: Rotation within the dimer activates cGMP synthesis by approximating cyclase domains . Phosphorylation: Activation is modulated by phosphorylation in the KHD; ligand binding may expose phosphorylated sites to phosphatases for dephosphorylation and inactivation. Desensitization: Prolonged ligand exposure can lead to dephosphorylation of the KHD, reducing pGC activity. Intracellular Signalling: cGMP Production: Activated cyclase domain produces cGMP from GTP, serving as a second messenger. cGMP Targets: cGMP-Dependent Protein Kinases (cGKs): Phosphorylate proteins to elicit cellular responses.

Structure: Characterised by seven transmembrane segments that span the cell membrane. (Option A) Binding Sites: Extracellular : Hormone-binding site. Intracellular : Interacts with G proteins. G Proteins Heterotrimeric: Consist of α , β , and γ subunits. Inactive State : G protein complex binds GDP on the α subunit. GPCR Activation Mechanism Hormone Binding: Hormone binds to the extracellular site, causing a conformational change. G Protein Activation : GDP on the α subunit is replaced by GTP. (Option B) Subunit Dissociation: α subunit (with GTP) dissociates from β and γ subunits. Signal Propagation: Interaction with Effectors : α subunit interacts with enzymes or ion channels. Example : Activation of adenylyl cyclase, converting ATP to cAMP. Signal Termination: Intrinsic GTPase Activity : α subunit hydrolyzes GTP to GDP, inactivating the α subunit. Receptor Deactivation: α subunit reassociates with β and γ subunits, resetting the GPCR. Regulation of GPCR Sensitivity Dynamic Receptor Numbers: Receptor numbers on target cells can change. Down-Regulation: Prolonged hormone exposure reduces receptor numbers, decreasing sensitivity. Mechanisms include: Receptor inactivation. Receptor internalization and sequestration. Receptor degradation by lysosomes. Reduced receptor production. Up-Regulation: Increases receptor numbers or sensitivity, enhancing responsiveness. (Option D) The α subunit does not permanently inactivate the GPCR. Instead, it initiates downstream signaling cascades when activated by exchanging GDP for GTP. After activation, the GTP-bound α subunit dissociates from the βγ subunits and interacts with effector proteins to transmit signals within the cell. The GPCR itself can undergo desensitization and internalization after activation, but this is not caused by the α subunit permanently inactivating it.
