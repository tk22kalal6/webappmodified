        "C": "Growth hormone",

      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "hormone is not recognized for significantly influencing fetal growth. Incorrect Options: Options A, B & D: Insulin, thyroid hormone, and cortisol play important roles in the inutero growth of a fetus.",

      "question": "IV irritants were given as a result bradycardia,hypotension and apnea was developed. This represents which one of the following reflexes?",
      "options": {
        "A": "Bezold jarisch reflex",
        "B": "Bainbridge reflex",
        "C": "Cushing reflex",
        "D": "None of them"
      },
      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "triad of responses (hypotension, bradycardia, and apnea) that can occur when certain types of intravenous drugs, known as 'irritants', are administered. This reflex is mediated by the activation of certain types of sensory nerve endings, known as chemoreceptors or mechanoreceptors, in the heart and lungs. Incorrect Options: Option B - Bainbridge reflex: The Bainbridge reflex is a physiological reflex that increases heart rate when venous return to the heart increases. It does not typically result in a triad of hypotension, bradycardia, and apnea. Option C - Cushing reflex: The Cushing reflex is a physiological nervous system response to increased intracranial pressure that results in Cushing's triad of increased blood pressure, irregular or decreased respirations, and bradycardia. It is not typically associated with the administration of intravenous irritants. Option D - None of them: This is not the correct answer, as the Bezold-Jarisch reflex is the reflex that most closely fits the description given.",

      "question": "A 7-month-old child was brought by her mother with complaints of diarrhoea and mucocutaneous lesions, as shown in the image. The symptoms have been present since weaning was started. What is the diagnosis?",
      "options": {
        "A": "Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome",
        "B": "Acrodermatitis enteropathica",
        "C": "Pediatric epidermolysis bullosa",
        "D": "Atopic dermatitis"
      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer B- Acrodermatitis enteropathica Explanation: The patient's presentation with diarrhea and mucocutaneous lesions, which started since weaning is suggestive of a zinc deficiency disorder called as acrodermatitis enteropathica . This rare autosomal recessive condition occurs due to impaired zinc absorption from a defective ZIP4 protein , typically becoming apparent when breast milk (naturally rich in bioavailable zinc) is replaced with solid foods. Acrodermatitis Enteropathica: Autosomal recessive disorder. Severe zinc deficiency due to impaired intestinal absorption (ZIP4 protein defect). Early infancy onset: Vesiculobullous, dry, scaly skin lesions (periorificial, buttocks, acral areas). Associated with alopecia, eye changes, chronic diarrhea, growth retardation, and stomatitis. Treatment: 2-3 mg/kg/day oral zinc therapy. Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome (Option A): This primary immunodeficiency presents with the classic triad of recurrent infections, eczema, and thrombocytopenia. The timing of onset with weaning and the absence of bleeding manifestations make this",
