      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "secreted by the parathyroid glands. It plays a crucial role in the regulation of calcium and phosphate levels in the blood. Parathormone acts on the kidneys and stimulates the production of the active form of vitamin D3, 1,25-OH-cholecalciferol. Therefore, parathormone positively regulates blood levels of 1,25-OH-cholecalciferol. Incorrect options Option A) Thyroxine: Thyroxine, also known as T4, is a hormone secreted by the thyroid gland. While thyroid hormones play a role in calcium metabolism, they do not directly regulate the blood levels of 1,25-OH-cholecalciferol (active form of vitamin D3). Option C) Insulin: Insulin is a hormone secreted by the pancreas and plays a key role in glucose metabolism and regulation of blood sugar levels. While insulin can indirectly influence calcium metabolism, it does not directly regulate blood levels of 1,25-OH-cholecalciferol. Option D) Calcitonin: Calcitonin is a hormone secreted by the thyroid gland and plays a role in calcium homeostasis. Calcitonin helps to decrease blood calcium levels by inhibiting bone resorption and enhancing calcium excretion by the kidneys. However, it does not directly regulate the blood levels of 1,25-OH-cholecalciferol.",

      "explanation": "Correct answer: D) All of the above Explanation: Serum calcium levels are regulated by a combination of calcitonin, parathormone (PTH), and vitamin D. Calcitonin lowers blood calcium levels by inhibiting osteoclast activity in bones, reducing calcium release. Parathormone (PTH) increases blood calcium levels by stimulating osteoclast activity and promoting calcium reabsorption in the kidneys. Vitamin D enhances calcium absorption from the intestines and helps in bone mineralization. Reference: Costanzo’s Physiology- Edition 6, Page 458",

      "correct_answer": "D",
      "explanation": "Correct answer: D) Oxytocin Explanation: During breastfeeding, oxytocin is released in response to nipple stimulation. Oxytocin causes the smooth muscles around the mammary glands to contract, leading to milk ejection (the \"let-down\" reflex). These contractions can sometimes cause breast cramps or discomfort. Progesterone (option A) : Progesterone plays a role in preparing the breast tissue for lactation but is not directly responsible for the cramps experienced during breastfeeding. Estrogen (option B) : Estrogen is involved in breast development and lactation preparation, but it does not directly cause the cramps during breastfeeding. Prolactin (option C) : Prolactin stimulates milk production but does not contribute to the breast cramps associated with breastfeeding.

      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: A) LH Explanation: Beta hCG (human chorionic gonadotropin) is structurally similar to LH (luteinizing hormone). Human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) is a hormone produced during pregnancy. The placenta primarily secretes it and has various functions, including supporting the development of the corpus luteum and maintaining progesterone production. Human Chorionic Gonadotropin (hCG) Physiology of hCG Production and Source : Produced primarily by syncytiotrophoblasts of the placenta post-implantation. Minor production occurs in the anterior pituitary, liver, and certain tumors (e.g., choriocarcinoma, germ cell tumors). Structure : Subunits : Alpha ( α ): Shared with LH, FSH, and TSH. Beta ( β ): Unique, determines biological specificity, contains glycosylation sites influencing activity. Functions : Function Role Maintaining Pregnancy Stimulates corpus luteum to produce progesterone, essential for uterine lining maintenance. Trophoblast Growth Enhances cytotrophoblast growth and placental development. Angiogenesis Promotes blood vessel formation in uterine endothelium for fetal nutrition and oxygenation. Immunomodulation Alters immune responses to promote fetal tolerance at the maternal-fetal interface. Clinical Significance : Detectable in maternal blood ~10 days post-ovulation; peaks at 8-10 weeks, then declines but remains elevated. Used to confirm pregnancy, monitor its progression, and diagnose ectopic pregnancies or trophoblastic diseases. Isoforms and Implications : Isoform Characteristics/ Functions Classical hCG Supports early pregnancy. Hyperglycosylated hCG Involved in placental invasion and growth. Free β Subunit Elevated levels may indicate malignancies (e.g., trophoblastic tumors). Sulfated hCG May influence pregnancy outcomes.

      "explanation": "Correct Answer: A) Parathyroid adenoma Explanation: A parathyroid adenoma causes primary hyperparathyroidism, where the parathyroid gland itself produces excess parathyroid hormone (PTH). This is not a cause of secondary hyperparathyroidism. Incorrect Options: Lithium intake (Option B): Chronic lithium use interferes with calcium sensing in the parathyroid glands, leading to secondary hyperparathyroidism. Vitamin D deficiency (Option C): Impairs calcium absorption, leading to low calcium levels. This stimulates the parathyroid glands to release more PTH to increase calcium levels, resulting in secondary hyperparathyroidism. Chronic kidney disease (Option D): Reduces the kidneys' ability to excrete phosphate and activate vitamin D, disrupting calcium and phosphate balance, which leads to secondary hyperparathyroidism.

      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: C) Thyroxine-binding globulin Explanation: Thyroxine ( T4 ) and triiodothyronine ( T3 ) are thyroid hormones transported in the blood bound to carrier proteins. These carrier proteins ensure the hormones' solubility and regulate their availability to tissues. TBG is the primary and most specific protein that binds to thyroxine (T4) and triiodothyronine (T3). It has a high affinity for thyroid hormones and is responsible for carrying the majority of T4 in the blood. Follistatin (Option A): Follistatin is not involved in thyroid hormone transport. It primarily binds to and inhibits activins, which are proteins involved in various biological processes. Transthyretin (Option B): Transthyretin (TTR), also known as prealbumin, binds a smaller fraction of T4 compared to TBG. It plays a secondary role in thyroid hormone transport, particularly in the cerebrospinal fluid. Transferrin (Option D): Transferrin is a transport protein for iron in the blood and is unrelated to thyroid hormone transport.

      "explanation": "Correct Answer: B) Milk ejection Explanation: Oxytocin, a hormone released by the posterior pituitary, is primarily involved in stimulating the milk ejection reflex (let-down reflex) during breastfeeding. Oxytocin acts on the myoepithelial cells surrounding the alveoli of the mammary glands, causing them to contract. This contraction propels milk from the alveoli into the ducts and towards the nipple, enabling milk ejection. Milk production (Option A): Milk production is regulated by prolactin , another hormone secreted by the anterior pituitary, not oxytocin. Milk storage (Option C): Milk storage occurs in the alveoli and lactiferous sinuses of the mammary glands. Oxytocin is not involved in this process. Osmoregulation (Option D): While oxytocin has some roles in osmoregulation by influencing kidney function, its primary physiological role is in milk ejection and uterine contractions during labor .

      },
      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: C) Hypotension Explanation: Vasopressin (antidiuretic hormone, ADH) is secreted by the posterior pituitary in response to key physiological changes, including hypotension (low blood pressure) and hyperosmolality of the extracellular fluid. Among the options provided, hypotension is the best stimulus for vasopressin release. Baroreceptors in the carotid sinus and aortic arch detect a drop in blood pressure. Hypotension triggers vasopressin secretion to conserve water, restore blood volume, and stabilize blood pressure. Vasopressin also causes vasoconstriction to elevate blood pressure. The most potent stimuli for vasopressin release are: Increased plasma osmolality (hyperosmolarity). Decreased blood pressure or blood volume (hypotension). Hypotonicity of extracellular fluid (Option A): Hypotonicity (low osmolality) suppresses vasopressin release. The body does not need to conserve water when the plasma is dilute. Instead, water is excreted to restore normal osmolality. Hypertension (Option B): High blood pressure inhibits vasopressin release as there is no need to conserve water or elevate pressure further. Hypo-osmolarity of extracellular fluid (Option D): Similar to hypotonicity, hypo-osmolarity inhibits vasopressin release. This allows the kidneys to excrete more water to restore plasma osmolality.

Enterokinase acts on trypsinogen, cleaving it at a specific site to generate active trypsin. Once trypsin is formed, it can then further activate other pancreatic zymogens, such as chymotrypsinogen and procarboxypeptidase, initiating the digestive process. Incorrect options: Option B. Trypsin: Trypsin is not activated by enterokinase. Instead, enterokinase is responsible for the activation of trypsinogen to form trypsin. Once trypsin is formed, it can activate other pancreatic zymogens and participate in the digestion of proteins. Option C. Chymotrypsin: Enterokinase does not directly activate chymotrypsin. Chymotrypsinogen, the inactive precursor of chymotrypsin, is activated by trypsin. Trypsin cleaves chymotrypsinogen to generate active chymotrypsin. Therefore, the activation of chymotrypsinogen is dependent on the presence of trypsin, not enterokinase. Option D. Antitrypsin: Antitrypsin, also known as alpha-1 antitrypsin, is a protein that functions as an inhibitor of proteases, including trypsin. It is not activated by enterokinase. Instead, antitrypsin acts to regulate and inhibit the activity of trypsin and other proteases to prevent excessive tissue damage.",

      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "Insulin. Insulin is a peptide hormone that regulates glucose metabolism in the body. It is composed of two peptide chains, namely the A chain and B chain, which are held together by disulfide bonds. Insulin receptors are tyrosine kinase receptors located on the surface of target cells. The insulin receptor is a tetramer, consisting of two α -subunits and two β -subunits. The α -subunits are located extracellularly and contain the insulin-binding sites, while the β -subunits span the cell membrane and possess the tyrosine kinase catalytic activity. When insulin binds to the α -subunits of the receptor, it triggers a series of signaling events leading to the activation of the tyrosine kinase domain in the β -subunits. This activation initiates downstream signaling pathways involved in glucose uptake, glycogen synthesis, and other cellular responses to insulin. Incorrect option: Option B. Glucagon: Glucagon is a peptide hormone that has its own receptor, but it does not bind to tyrosine kinase receptors. Glucagon receptors belong to the G protein-coupled receptor family and activate different signaling pathways compared to tyrosine kinase receptors. Option C. T3: T3 (triiodothyronine) is a thyroid hormone that acts primarily through nuclear receptors rather than tyrosine kinase receptors. The binding of T3 to its receptors in the nucleus regulates gene expression and metabolic processes. Option D.

      "explanation": "energy balance and body weight. Leptin levels are influenced by the amount of body fat, and it communicates with the hypothalamus to regulate appetite and metabolism. Leptin also has an impact on the onset of puberty. Adequate leptin levels are required for the normal initiation and progression of puberty, particularly in females. It acts as a permissive hormone, providing signals to the hypothalamus that the body has sufficient energy reserves for puberty to proceed. Incorrect options: Option A . GnRH (Gonadotropin-Releasing Hormone): GnRH is a hormone produced and released by the hypothalamus. It plays a crucial role in the initiation and regulation of the reproductive system. It stimulates the release of luteinizing hormone (LH) and follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) from the anterior pituitary gland, which in turn stimulates the production of sex hormones (estrogen and testosterone) by the ovaries and testes. While GnRH is necessary for the activation of the reproductive system, it does not directly play a permissive role in the attainment of puberty. Option C. Insulin: Insulin is a hormone produced by the pancreas, and its primary role is to regulate blood glucose levels. While insulin is not directly involved in the attainment of puberty, it plays a role in overall growth and development. Insulin deficiency or resistance can disrupt normal growth and delay the onset of puberty. Option D .GH (Growth Hormone): Growth hormone, also known as somatotropin, is produced by the anterior pituitary gland. It plays a significant role in growth, particularly during childhood and adolescence. While GH is not directly involved in the initiation of puberty, it is necessary for the proper development of the skeletal system and overall growth.

Option B. Thyroid hormone deiodinases inactivating T3: Deiodinase enzymes, specifically type 3 deiodinase (D3), play a crucial role in inactivating thyroid hormones, particularly triiodothyronine (T3), by converting it into inactive forms like 3,3'-diiodothyronine (reverse T3). This process helps regulate local thyroid hormone concentrations and is essential for thyroid hormone homeostasis. Option C. Degradation of retinoic acid by Cyp26b1 in primordial germ cell of males: Cyp26b1 is a cytochrome P450 enzyme that degrades retinoic acid, a derivative of vitamin A and an important signaling molecule. Its degradation in specific cells, such as primordial germ cells, helps regulate the local concentration of retinoic acid, which is essential for various developmental processes.

      "explanation": "insulin secretion depending on the physiological state and the body's immediate needs. During stress, exercise, and hypoglycemia, epinephrine primarily inhibits insulin secretion to raise blood sugar levels and provide energy for the body's demands. In contrast, during periods of rest and digestion, epinephrine levels are low, allowing insulin to facilitate glucose uptake and storage. Incorrect Options: Option B - Gastric Inhibitory polypeptide: Gastric Inhibitory Polypeptide, also known as Glucose-Dependent Insulinotropic Peptide, is a hormone released from the gut in response to the ingestion of food, particularly carbohydrates. GIP plays a role in stimulating insulin secretion. It is an incretin hormone, meaning it promotes the release of insulin from pancreatic beta cells in response to elevated blood glucose levels. So, GIP has a stimulatory effect on insulin secretion by helping the body manage post-meal glucose levels. Option C - Acetylcholine: Acetylcholine is a neurotransmitter with multiple functions, and its impact on insulin secretion is generally stimulatory. In the context of the original question, Acetylcholine would not be considered as having an inhibitory effect on insulin secretion. Instead, it can stimulate insulin release from pancreatic beta cells when activated. Option D - None of the above",

      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "inability to concentrate urine leads to large volumes of dilute urine (Polyuria). Polydipsia means excessive thirst because the body tries to compensate for high fluid loss by increasing thirst to encourage more fluid intake. Diabetes insipidus is a condition in which there is the absence of or poor response to anti-diuretic hormone (ADH). This results in reduced distal tubule and collecting duct permeability to water. This causes the kidneys to excrete large amounts of dilute urine that clinically manifests as polyuria and polydipsia. Diagnosis: Low urine osmolality (<600 mosm/L) in association with high plasma osmolality {>300 mosm/L} Water deprivation test → differentiates psychogenic polydipsia from DI The vasopressin response test → to differentiate central DI and nephrogenic DI An increase in urine osmolality by >50% of the baseline indicates Central DI DM (Diabetes Mellitus) (Option A): This option is unlikely because the HbA1C level of 5.5% and the blood glucose levels are within the normal range (HbA1C < 6.5% and blood glucose < 126 mg/dL for diagnosis of diabetes).

The conversion of T4 to T3 occurs primarily in the peripheral tissues, such as the liver, kidney, and skeletal muscle. The enzyme responsible for the conversion of T4 to T3 is iodothyronine deiodinase I (D1). D1 is expressed in various tissues, including the liver, kidney, and thyroid gland. D1 catalyzes the removal of an iodine atom from the outer ring of T4, producing T3. Incorrect Choices: Option b. Iodothyronine deiodinase III: Iodothyronine deiodinase III (D3) is an enzyme that can inactivate thyroid hormones by removing iodine atoms from the inner ring of T4 and T3. D3 is not involved in the conversion of T4 to T3. Option c. Iodothyronine deiodinase II: Iodothyronine deiodinase II (D2) is another enzyme that can convert T4 to T3, but it is primarily expressed in the thyroid gland and pituitary gland.

For the next 2 to 4 weeks the sperm swims through the epididymis as it develops further and gains motility. Sperm Changes in epididymis Description Motility Acquisition Sperm leaving the testes are not fully mobile. They gain progressive motility in the epididymis. Inhibitory proteins suppress motility until ejaculation. Cation Channel Activation Activation of CatSper family cation channels occurs. Alkaline-sensitive Ca2+ channels become active as sperm move to more alkaline cervical mucus. Chemotaxis Development Develop the ability to sense chemical signals from the ovaries, helping guide them toward the ovary. Concentration Become concentrated due to fluid reabsorption. Epididymal Fluid Contribution Epididymis and Sertoli cells secrete nutrient-rich fluid containing hormones, enzymes, and nutrients essential for maturation. Sperm Storage Epididymis serves as the primary storage site (for 2-4 weeks). (Option C) Sperm can maintain fertility for at least a month. Timeframe for Motility Sperm gain the capability for motility after 18 to 24 hours in the epididymis. Full maturation and hypermotility occur in the female genital tract. Acrosome Maturation The acrosome, located at the sperm head and containing enzymes for fertilization, matures while sperm are stored in the epididymis. Zona Pellucida Binding Ability Sperm acquire receptors during epididymal transit that enable them to bind to the zona pellucida, facilitating penetration and fertilization of the egg. Therefore this occurs before ejaculation. Capacitation Post-Epididymis Full fertilization capacity (capacitation) occurs after sperm leave the epididymis.

      "explanation": "a-subunits and two I -subunits. The a-subunits are located extracellularly and contain the insulin-binding sites, while the I -subunits span the cell membrane and possess the tyrosine kinase catalytic activity. When insulin binds to the a-subunits of the receptor, it triggers a series of signaling events leading to the activation of the tyrosine kinase domain in the I -subunits. This activation initiates downstream signaling pathways involved in glucose uptake, glycogen synthesis, and other cellular responses to insulin. Receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) Enzyme-linked receptors located on cell membranes. Pass through the membrane once; the hormone-binding site is extracellular, and the catalytic site is intracellular. Mechanism of Action: Hormone Binding: Hormone binds to the extracellular part of the RTK. Enzyme Activation: Binding activates or inactivates an intracellular enzyme. Some RTKs have intrinsic enzymatic activity, while others depend on associated enzymes. Hormones Utilising Receptor Tyrosine Kinase Signalling: Fibroblast Growth Factor Growth Hormone Hepatocyte Growth Factor Insulin (Option A) Insulin-like Growth Factor-1 Leptin Prolactin Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor Glucagon (Option B): Glucagon is a peptide hormone that has its own receptor, but it does not bind to tyrosine kinase receptors. Glucagon receptors belong to the G protein-coupled receptor family and activate different signaling pathways compared to tyrosine kinase receptors. T3 (Option C): T3 (triiodothyronine) is a thyroid hormone that acts primarily through nuclear receptors rather than tyrosine kinase receptors. The binding of T3 to its receptors in the nucleus regulates gene expression and metabolic processes. ADH (Option D): (Antidiuretic Hormone, also known as vasopressin) ADH acts through G protein-coupled receptors , specifically V1 and V2 receptors, and does not involve tyrosine kinase receptor signaling.

      "question": "All are Glucogenic hormones except?",
      "options": {
        "A": "ADH",
        "B": "Glucagon",
        "C": "Thyroxine",
        "D": "Glucocorticoids"
      },
      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "production or release of glucose in the body. They stimulate processes such as glycogenolysis (breakdown of glycogen), gluconeogenesis (synthesis of glucose from non-carbohydrate sources), and the release of glucose into the bloodstream. ADH, also called vasopressin, primarily regulates water balance by increasing water reabsorption in the kidneys. It does not have a direct role in glucose metabolism or gluconeogenesis, so it is not considered a glucogenic hormone. List of glucogenic hormones: Glucagon: (Option B ruled out) Glucagon is released by the alpha cells of the pancreas in response to low blood glucose levels. It stimulates the breakdown of glycogen (glycogenolysis) in the liver to release glucose into the bloodstream. Glucocorticoids: (Option D ruled out) Glucocorticoids, such as cortisol, are steroid hormones released by the adrenal glands. They promote glucose production by stimulating gluconeogenesis in the liver, where amino acids and other molecules are converted into glucose. Growth Hormone: Growth hormone (GH), also known as somatotropin, is released by the pituitary gland. It has both anabolic and catabolic effects and can stimulate gluconeogenesis to increase blood glucose levels. Epinephrine: Epinephrine, also called adrenaline, is released by the adrenal glands in response to stress or during the fight-or-flight response. It increases blood glucose levels by promoting glycogen breakdown in the liver (glycogenolysis) and inhibiting insulin secretion. Glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1): GLP-1 is an incretin hormone released by the intestines in response to food intake. It stimulates insulin release from the pancreas and inhibits glucagon secretion, helping to regulate glucose levels. Corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH): CRH is released by the hypothalamus and plays a role in the regulation of the hypothalamic-pituitary- adrenal (HPA) axis. It can indirectly influence glucose metabolism through the release of cortisol. Throxine: (Option C ruled out) Increase absorption of glucose from the intestine. Induce hepatic gluconeogenesis and glycogenolysis, raising plasma glucose.

      "question": "A 45-year-old person presents to the outpatient department with a 6-month history of increased urine output and increased water intake. On investigation, the following results are obtained: HbA1C - 5.5%, Blood glucose - 80 mg/dL, Postprandial glucose - 130 mg/dL, and decreased urine osmolarity. What would be the most probable diagnosis for this given condition?",
      "options": {
        "A": "DM",
        "B": "Diabetes Insipidius",
        "C": "Conn's Disease",
        "D": "Addison disease"
      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "by the inability of the kidneys to concentrate urine properly, leading to excessive dilute urine output (polyuria) and increased thirst (polydipsia). In this case, the decreased urine osmolarity is a key clue. Diabetes insipidus can be central (due to a lack of antidiuretic hormone, ADH) or nephrogenic (due to kidney insensitivity to ADH). Incorrect Options: Option A - DM (Diabetes Mellitus): This option is unlikely because the HbA1C level of 5.5% and the blood glucose levels are within the normal range (HbA1C < 6.5% and blood glucose < 126 mg/dL for diagnosis of diabetes). Option C - Conn's Disease (Primary Hyperaldosteronism): This condition is characterized by excessive production of aldosterone by the adrenal glands, leading to high blood pressure and low blood potassium levels. Option D - Addison's Disease (Adrenal Insufficiency): This condition involves the adrenal glands not producing enough cortisol and, in some cases, aldosterone. Symptoms often include fatigue, weight loss, and low blood pressure. Reference: .",
