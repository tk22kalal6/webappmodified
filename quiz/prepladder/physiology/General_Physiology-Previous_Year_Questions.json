      "correct_answer": "D",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: D) Pituitary gland Explanation: The pituitary gland does not have the presence of the sodium iodide symporter. Unlike the thyroid gland and certain other tissues, the pituitary gland does not actively concentrate iodine, and the expression of NIS is not found in this gland. In summary, while NIS is present in the thyroid gland, placenta, and salivary glands, it is not found in the pituitary gland. Sodium Iodide Symporter (NIS): Locations of NIS and Functions Location Function Thyroid Gland (Option A ruled out) Active iodide transport for thyroid hormone synthesis (T3, T4) in thyroid follicular cells. Salivary Glands (Option C ruled out) Possible role in regulating iodide content in saliva (exact function unclear). Gastric Mucosa Potential involvement in iodide transport within the stomach. Placenta (Option B ruled out) Allows iodide transfer from maternal to fetal circulation, necessary for the development of the fetal thyroid gland. Mammary Glands Facilitates iodide transfer during lactation for breastfeeding purposes. Kidney Aids in iodide homeostasis, with expression in renal tubular cells. Other Tissues Observed in extrathyroidal tissues with unclear or under-researched roles.

      "explanation": "sequence is a hydrophobic transmembrane domain that integrates into the lipid bilayer. This non-cleavable sequence directs the protein to the membrane, anchoring it in place, with the N-terminal in the cytoplasm and the C-terminal facing the extracellular space or lumen. Type II Membrane Proteins Overview Signal-Anchor Sequence : Contains a non-cleavable signal-anchor sequence that anchors the protein to the membrane, unlike type I proteins. Functions as both a signal and membrane anchor during protein synthesis. Orientation : N-terminal is directed towards the cytoplasm. C-terminal faces the extracellular space or the lumen of organelles (e.g., ER, Golgi). Insertion Mechanism : Insertion occurs cotranslationally into the ER. The signal-anchor sequence directs the polypeptide to the translocon. Positively charged amino acids before the transmembrane domain ensure proper orientation. Examples : Transferrin receptor and glycosyltransferases. At the C-terminal (Option B): : The signal-anchor sequence is not at the C-terminal; it is near the N-terminal, which faces the cytoplasm. At the N-terminal (Option C) : The N-terminal faces the cytoplasm but does not contain the signal-anchor sequence, which is located near it. Both inside the membrane and at the C-terminal (Option D) : The signal-anchor sequence is inside the membrane but not at the C-terminal; it functions as a transmembrane domain.

      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "on insulin for glucose uptake. Insulin promotes the translocation of glucose transporters (GLUT4) to the cell surface in both of these tissues. GLUT4 allows glucose to enter these cells, where it can be used for energy (in muscle cells) or stored as fat (in adipose tissue). Lipogenesis: Insulin promotes the synthesis of fatty acids and triglycerides, especially in adipose tissue. Glycogen synthesis: Insulin stimulates glycogen synthesis in both muscle and liver tissues. Glucose uptake: Insulin increases glucose uptake into insulin-sensitive cells such as muscle and adipose tissue. Protein synthesis: Insulin promotes the uptake of amino acids into cells, enhancing protein synthesis. Ketogenesis: Insulin decreases ketogenesis. It reduces the breakdown of fatty acids and the formation of ketone bodies in the liver. Gluconeogenesis: Insulin inhibits gluconeogenesis in the liver, reducing the production of glucose Incorrect Options: Liver (Option A): The liver utilizes both insulin-dependent and insulin-independent mechanisms for glucose uptake. Insulin suppresses gluconeogenesis (glucose production) and promotes glycogen synthesis, facilitating glucose storage. Brain (Option B): The brain does not depend on insulin for glucose uptake. Glucose transport is mediated by insulin-independent GLUT1 transporters across the blood-brain barrier. Kidneys (Option D): The kidneys have minimal reliance on insulin for glucose uptake. Glucose reabsorption is facilitated by GLUT2 transporters and is not primarily regulated by insulin.

      "explanation": "secretion of HCO3- of HCO3 Explanation: The second phase of saliva secretion occurs in the ductal system , where the primary saliva undergoes modification. Here’s a structured breakdown: Key Ionic Changes in Ductal Modification of Saliva: Active Na I reabsorption → Reduces sodium concentration in saliva. Passive Cl I reabsorption → Follows sodium due to electrochemical gradient. Active K I secretion → Increases potassium concentration in saliva. Passive HCO II secretion → Increases bicarbonate concentration, helping maintain pH balance. Saliva contains high concentrations of potassium (K+) and bicarbonate (HCO3-) ions and lower concentrations of sodium (Na+) and chloride (Cl-) ions, making it a hypotonic solution. Except for saliva, all other gastrointestinal secretions, such as Gastric , Pancreatic and intestinal secretions, have osmolality similar to osmolality plasma, i.e., isotonic. Saliva is secreted by acinar cells of salivary glands. Reference: Guyton and Hall textbook of physiology, 14th edition, Pg 808, 809",

        "C": "32 mmHg",

      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "the osmotic pressure exerted by proteins, notably albumin, in a blood vessel's plasma that usually pulls water into the circulatory system, i.e., it is a retaining force. The normal value of oncotic pressure in a healthy individual's plasma is approximately 25 mmHg. Starling Forces: Paraphrased Summary Definition : The Starling forces describe fluid movement across capillary membranes, governed by hydrostatic and oncotic pressures. Typical Values of Starling Forces Pressure Type Value Description Capillary Hydrostatic Pressure (Pc I ) 36 mmHg (arteriolar) to 15 mmHg (venous) Pressure from blood within capillaries Colloid Osmotic Pressure ( π c I ) 25 mmHg Constant across capillary length Interstitial Hydrostatic Pressure (Pi) -3 mmHg Varies based on tissue type and conditions Interstitial Colloid Osmotic Pressure ( π i) 8 mmHg Lower due to less protein in interstitial fluid Clinical Relevance Starling forces are crucial for understanding fluid balance, edema, shock, and surgical fluid management. For example, hypoalbuminemia (low plasma protein levels) reduces oncotic pressure, increasing filtration and leading to edema. Revised Starling Principle Recent findings suggest microvessels are permeable to macromolecules, altering the original Starling hypothesis. Continuous low-level filtration from plasma to tissues helps maintain interstitial oncotic pressure, influencing fluid dynamics.

The Nernst equation calculates the electrical potential difference across a membrane (Nernst potential) that balances the diffusion of a specific ion, preventing further net movement despite a concentration gradient. The Nernst equation calculates the Nernst potential (EMF) for a single, univalent ion (an ion with a +1 or -1 charge) at normal body temperature (37°C) The Nernst potential magnitude depends on the ion concentration ratio across the membrane; larger differences result in higher potentials. Nernst equation calculates the potential for a single ion, although cell membranes are permeable to multiple ions.

        "D": "Sweating"
      },
      "correct_answer": "D",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: D) Sweating Explanation: When an individual is in a hot environment with a temperature of 47°C, the primary heat loss mechanism is sweating. Sweating is the process by which the body releases moisture (sweat) onto the skin's surface. As the sweat evaporates, it absorbs heat from the body, thus helping to cool it down. Sweating is an effective cooling mechanism in hot environments to dissipate heat and maintain body temperature within a normal range. Mechanisms of Heat Loss Radiation : Heat loss via infrared rays emitted from the body to the environment. Accounts for 60% of heat loss under normal conditions. Significant in cooler environments or when at rest. (Option A ruled out) Evaporation : Heat loss through vaporization of water from the skin and respiratory tract (sensible sweating and insensible losses). Accounts for 20-22% of heat loss at rest; can increase to 80% during intense activity. Crucial in high temperatures or during physical exertion. Conduction : Heat transfer from body to cooler adjacent objects (solid or liquid) via molecular contact. Contributes 2-15% of total heat loss, depending on surface contact. More significant when in contact with cooler surfaces (e.g., sitting on cold floor, swimming in cool water). (Option B ruled out) Convection : Heat loss through air or water movement around the body. Accounts for 15% of heat loss. More effective with increased wind or air movement.

      },
      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: A) Hypokalemia Explanation: Severe vomiting leads to hypokalaemia , which is a major risk factor for cardiac arrhythmias due to its effect on cardiac membrane potential and conduction . Mechanism: Vomiting causes loss of gastric acid (HCl) → metabolic alkalosis Alkalosis shifts potassium into cells → worsens hypokalaemia Renal compensation increases potassium excretion (due to increased bicarbonate delivery to the distal tubule) Low serum potassium disrupts cardiac repolarisation , leading to arrhythmias ECG changes in hypokalaemia: Flattened T waves U waves Prolonged QT interval → risk of ventricular arrhythmias (e.g., Torsades de Pointes, ventricular tachycardia) Hyponatraemia (Option B) is incorrect because although vomiting can lead to hyponatraemia (due to volume loss and ADH secretion), it is less likely to cause direct cardiac arrhythmias . Hyperkalaemia (Option C) is incorrect because vomiting typically leads to potassium loss , not hyperkalaemia. Hyperkalaemia is more commonly associated with renal failure, acidosis, or tissue breakdown . Hypocalcaemia (Option D) is incorrect because hypocalcaemia causes neuromuscular symptoms (tetany, Chvostek’s sign, Trousseau’s sign) and QT prolongation , but it is not the primary electrolyte abnormality seen in vomiting-induced arrhythmias.

The presence of these impermeable ions (such as proteins) creates an electrochemical imbalance, leading to the unequal distribution of permeable ions. Non-permeable ions (large proteins) cannot pass through the membrane but affect the distribution of permeable ions by drawing them toward or repelling them from the area to balance the charge and maintain electrical neutrality. This results in an osmotic pressure difference and an electrochemical gradient, where ion concentrations are not equal across the membrane but are still balanced in terms of charge. Phosphate, Bicarbonate in the intracellular compartment, and Calcium in the extracellular compartment (Option A, B, C): Are permeable and do not create the electrochemical gradient central to the Gibbs-Donnan effect.

      },
      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: A) Co-transport Explanation: In Oral Rehydration Solution (ORS), sodium is given along with glucose because sodium-glucose co-transport helps in the absorption of both sodium and glucose across the intestinal epithelium. The presence of glucose enhances the active transport of sodium through the sodium-glucose transporter (SGLT1) in the intestinal cells. This, in turn, increases the absorption of both sodium and water. Oral Rehydration Solution (ORS) absorption: The absorption of Oral Rehydration Solution (ORS) occurs primarily in the small intestine and is facilitated by the co-transport of sodium and glucose. Here's a brief together through a co-transporter called SGLT1 (Sodium-Glucose Linked Transporter 1). The presence of glucose helps facilitate the active absorption of sodium. The sodium-glucose co-transporter uses the sodium gradient (created by the sodium-potassium pump) to transport both sodium and glucose into the epithelial cells of the intestinal lining. Water absorption : As sodium and glucose are absorbed into the epithelial cells, they create an osmotic gradient, which leads to water being absorbed into the bloodstream through osmosis . The movement of sodium into the cells triggers water to follow through osmosis, thus replenishing lost fluids. Effect on dehydration : The combined absorption of sodium, glucose, and water effectively rehydrates the body, replenishing both electrolytes and fluids lost during diarrhea or vomiting. Osmosis (Option B) : Osmosis refers to the movement of water across a semipermeable membrane from an area of low solute concentration to an area of high solute concentration, but it doesn't directly explain the role of glucose in ORS. Facilitated diffusion (Option C) : This involves the transport of substances across a membrane through a carrier protein, but glucose and sodium in ORS rely on co-transport, not facilitated diffusion. Primary active transport (Option D) : This type of transport requires energy (ATP) to move substances against their concentration gradient, but sodium-glucose co-transport relies on a secondary active transport mechanism, not primary active transport.

Simple diffusion is the passive movement of molecules across the lipid bilayer, driven by a concentration gradient. Facilitated diffusion involves carrier proteins or channels but moves substances passively down their concentration gradient. Antiport (Na/K ATPase) is an active transport system that requires ATP to function. Symport relies on secondary active transport, which is indirectly powered by ATP. Transport Mechanisms in the Body Transport Type Mechanism ATP Requirement Example Paracellular transport Movement of substances between cells via tight junctions No Ion movement in renal tubules Simple diffusion Passive movement down a concentration gradient No Oxygen, carbon dioxide transport Facilitated diffusion Carrier or channel-mediated passive transport No GLUT-mediated glucose transport Antiport (Na/K ATPase) Active transport pumping ions in opposite directions Yes (Primary active transport) Na I /K I pump in all cells Symport Cotransport of two molecules in the same direction Yes (Secondary active transport) Na I /Glucose cotransport in intestines Paracellular (Option 1): Correct because it allows passive movement of ions between epithelial cells without ATP. Simple Diffusion (Option 2): Correct because it relies on the natural concentration gradient and does not need energy. Facilitated Diffusion (Option 3): Correct because it uses transport proteins for movement down the gradient but does not consume ATP. Antiport (Na/K ATPase) (Option 4): Incorrect because it is an active transport mechanism that requires ATP to pump Na I and K I against their gradients. Symport (Option 5) : Incorrect because it relies on secondary active transport, which uses ATP indirectly via the Na/K ATPase pump.

      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "(hypertension) and bradycardia (low heart rate) suggests activation of the baroreceptor reflex , a homeostatic mechanism that regulates blood pressure. Mechanism: Increased blood pressure stretches baroreceptors in the carotid sinus (CN IX) and aortic arch (CN X) . Increased baroreceptor firing signals the medulla (nucleus tractus solitarius) . Response: Inhibition of sympathetic outflow → ↓ heart rate (bradycardia) and ↓ vasoconstriction Activation of parasympathetic (vagal) tone → further ↓ heart rate Baroreceptor Reflex Aspect Details Mechanism Baroreceptors in the carotid sinus and the aortic arch detect BP changes Increased BP stretches receptors, sending signals to medulla via glossopharyngeal and vagus nerves Medulla inhibits vasoconstrictor center and stimulates vagal parasympathetic center Actions Vasodilation of blood vessels Decreased heart rate and contraction strength Reduced BP due to lower peripheral resistance and cardiac output Importance Maintains BP stability during activities like standing Fastest acting Tends to reset within 1-2 days for long-term regulation This helps counteract hypertension and maintain homeostasis. Inhibition of Baroreceptors (Option B) is incorrect because inhibition of baroreceptors occurs in hypotension , leading to tachycardia and vasoconstriction to restore blood pressure. Bezold-Jarisch Reflex (Option C) is incorrect because this reflex causes bradycardia and hypotension , typically triggered by ventricular ischemia or excessive vagal stimulation , not hypertension. Stimulation of Chemoreceptors (Option D) is incorrect because chemoreceptors (in the carotid bodies and medulla) primarily respond to hypoxia, hypercapnia, or acidosis , leading to increased respiratory drive and sympathetic activation (tachycardia), not bradycardia.

      },
      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: A) Inhibits acetylcholine release from the presynaptic terminal Explanation: Botulinum toxin prevents acetylcholine (ACh) release at the neuromuscular junction , leading to flaccid paralysis . Mechanism of Action: Botulinum toxin cleaves SNARE proteins (SNAP-25, synaptobrevin, syntaxin) , which are essential for vesicular fusion with the presynaptic membrane. This prevents ACh-containing vesicles from being released into the synaptic cleft. Result: Muscle paralysis due to the lack of ACh stimulation at the nicotinic receptors . Clinical Uses: Botox (cosmetic use) : Reduces wrinkles by relaxing muscles. Dystonias (e.g., cervical dystonia, blepharospasm) Spasticity (e.g., cerebral palsy, stroke-related spasticity) Hyperhidrosis (excessive sweating) Toxicity: Causes botulism , presenting with flaccid paralysis, ptosis, diplopia, dysphagia, and respiratory failure . Common sources: Improperly canned foods, honey (infant botulism) . Botulinum toxins: These are potent neurotoxins produced by Clostridium botulinum bacteria. There are several types, with types A, B, and E being toxic to humans. Mechanism : Botulinum toxins A and E cleave SNAP-25 (synaptosome-associated protein-25), and B cleave Synaptobrevin, which are presynaptic membrane proteins essential for releasing acetylcholine at the neuromuscular junction leading to Flaccid paralysis. Inhibits acetylcholine reuptake (Option B) is incorrect because ACh is not reuptaken ; it is degraded by acetylcholinesterase in the synapse. Blocks the postsynaptic acetylcholine receptor (Option C) is incorrect because this describes the action of curare and neuromuscular blockers (e.g., pancuronium, rocuronium) . Inhibits acetylcholinesterase (Option D) is incorrect because this describes the action of acetylcholinesterase inhibitors (e.g., neostigmine, organophosphates) , which increase ACh levels rather than decrease them.

      },
      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: C) Total body water in infants is more than in adults Explanation: Infants have a higher total body water (TBW) percentage compared to adults, making them more susceptible to dehydration . Total body water (TBW) composition: Infants: ~ 75-80% of body weight Adults: ~ 55-60% of body weight Higher water turnover: Infants lose water more rapidly due to higher metabolic rates, increased insensible losses, and immature renal function . Total Body Water (TBW) Composition: 90% of body weight in early fetal life. 75% of body weight at birth. 60% of body weight by the end of the first year, remaining consistent until puberty. After puberty, males have slightly more TBW compared to females. Preterm vs. Term Neonates: Preterm neonates have a higher TBW compared to term neonates. TBW Distribution: TBW is divided into: Extracellular Fluid (ECF) Intracellular Fluid (ICF) The equation is: TBW = ECF + ICF ECF = plasma + interstitial fluid ECF and ICF Changes: In fetuses and newborns, ECF > ICF volume. After birth, ECF volume decreases and ICF volume increases. Extracellular fluid (ECF) is more than intracellular fluid (ICF) (Option A) is incorrect because, while infants have a higher ECF proportion at birth (~40%) , ICF eventually exceeds ECF as they grow. Intracellular fluid (ICF) is more than extracellular fluid (ECF) (Option B) is incorrect at birth , but becomes true after the first year . In neonates, ECF is initially greater than ICF . Extracellular fluid equals intracellular fluid (Option D) is incorrect because ECF and ICF are not equal at any stage ; there is always a shift, with ICF becoming dominant after infancy .

      "explanation": "potential. The RMP is mainly determined by the K + gradient across the cell membrane, as potassium ions move out of the cell through potassium leak channels. The loss of positively charged K + ions from the cell creates a negative charge inside the cell relative to the outside, establishing the RMP, which is typically around -70 mV in neurons. Incorrect Options: Option B - Calcium (Ca 2+ ) : Calcium ions play a crucial role in various cellular processes, including muscle contraction and neurotransmitter release. However, their influence on the RMP is relatively minimal compared to potassium. The primary role of calcium in relation to membrane potential is more related to action potentials and signal transduction rather than establishing the RMP. Option C - Sodium (Na + ) : Sodium ions also contribute to the membrane potential, but they are less influential than potassium in establishing the resting membrane potential. The sodium-potassium pump (Na + /K + ATPase) maintains the gradient by actively transporting 3 Na + ions out of the cell and 2 K + ions into the cell, which helps in stabilizing the RMP. However, the resting membrane potential is primarily determined by the K + gradient. Option D - Chloride (Cl-) : Chloride ions contribute to the membrane potential by balancing the charge, but they are not the primary determinant of the resting membrane potential. Chloride ions typically follow the electrochemical gradients established by other ions like potassium and sodium.",

They play a crucial role in modulating intracellular processes after a signal (such as a hormone or neurotransmitter) binds to a cell surface receptor. These messengers help amplify and propagate the signal within the cell, triggering responses such as gene expression, enzyme activation, or changes in cell metabolism.

      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: A) Sweating and vasodilation in the skin Explanation: When exercising vigorously in high temperatures, the body needs to dissipate heat to maintain a stable internal temperature. Sweating helps cool the body through evaporative cooling , while vasodilation (widening of blood vessels) in the skin increases blood flow to the surface, allowing more heat to be released into the environment. Shivering and vasoconstriction in the skin (Option B): are responses typically seen in cold environments. Shivering generates heat through muscle contractions, and vasoconstriction (narrowing of blood vessels) helps to retain heat. These mechanisms are not relevant in hot conditions. Increased production of heat by the liver (Option C): The liver produces heat as a byproduct of metabolic processes, but this is not a primary response to high temperatures during vigorous exercise. The body focuses on cooling mechanisms rather than increasing heat production in such conditions. Decreased heart rate (HR) and respiratory rate (RR) (Option D): During vigorous exercise, both heart rate and respiratory rate typically increase to meet the higher oxygen demands of the muscles. A decrease in HR and RR would not be expected under these conditions; instead, they would rise to support increased physical activity.

A: Surface area of diffusion. X: Thickness of the membrane. ∆ C: Concentration difference between membranes (most important determinant). Movement of molecules across a membrane via carrier protein. No expenditure of energy. For example, glucose is transported by all types of GLUT. Saturation is achieved after a certain point called the plateau. The maximum transport rate occurs at the plateau or saturation point, called maximum (Tm). Primary active transport (Option C) : This active transport uses cellular energy (ATP) to transport substances against their concentration gradient. This process often involves specific carrier proteins, such as the Na+/K+ ATPase pump. Secondary active transport (Option D): This type of active transport uses the energy stored in the form of ion concentration gradients, established by primary active transport, to drive the transport of other substances against their concentration gradient.

      "explanation": "than inulin clearance because of the tubular secretion of creatinine in addition to filtration. This makes creatinine clearance a practical but slightly imprecise measure of GFR. Creatinine is partially secreted and never reabsorbed by the renal tubules, which can result in an overestimation of GFR. Inulin is a freely filterable substance, neither endogenously secreted by the body nor reabsorbed by the nephron. Types of Clearance Measurements: Inulin Clearance Used to measure Glomerular Filtration Rate (GFR) as it is freely filtered but not reabsorbed or secreted. Not ideal for routine use due to intravenous administration. Creatinine Clearance Estimates GFR using creatinine, which is primarily filtered by the glomeruli. Slightly inaccurate due to tubular secretion, but practical for clinical settings. PAH Clearance Estimates Renal Plasma Flow (RPF). PAH is cleared through both glomerular filtration and tubular secretion. Correction for PAH extraction ratio improves accuracy.

However, the overall permeability to both ions is relatively low. Depolarization Phase (Between Points A and C): Voltage-gated Na+ channels open faster than K+ channels. Rapid influx of Na+ ions, causing a rapid rise in membrane potential, causing a steep slope. Peak of Action Potential (Point C): Na+ permeability is at its maximum. K+ channels are also opening at this stage but have not reached their peak. Early Repolarization Phase (Point D): Early phase of repolarization. Voltage-gated K+ channels are fully open, resulting in the highest permeability. Na+ channels are rapidly inactivated during this phase. Late Repolarization and After-hyperpolarization (Points E and F): K+ permeability starts to decline as the membrane potential moves towards its resting state. Slow closure of K+ channels results in a period of hyperpolarization, where the membrane potential falls slightly below the resting potential (Point F).",

From this equation, the resistance of a vessel is inversely proportional to the fourth power of radius and directly proportional to the length of the vessel.. So, if the radius and length are doubled, the original and other parameters remain constant, then the resistance will be: R = L/(r) 4 . R = 2/(2) 4 R = 2/16 = 8.

      },
      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: A) Metabolic acidosis Explanation: To determine the type of acid-base disturbance, let's break down the ABG results: pH: A pH of 7.1 indicates acidemia (a lower-than-normal pH) HCO3 (Bicarbonate): The bicarbonate level is 16 mEq/L, which is lower than the normal range (22-26 mEq/L). Low bicarbonate levels typically indicate a primary metabolic problem. PCO2 (Partial Pressure of Carbon Dioxide): The PCO2 level is 23 mmHg, which is lower than the normal range (35-45 mmHg). This indicates that the body is compensating for the primary metabolic disturbance by increasing respiratory rate to blow off CO2. Metabolic Acidosis: The low pH (acidosis) combined with low HCO3 suggests a primary metabolic acidosis. The decreased HCO3 is consistent with metabolic acidosis. The low PCO2 is a compensatory response to metabolic acidosis, where the body is trying to reduce CO2 to help counteract the acidosis. Metabolic Alkalosis (Option B): This would be characterized by a high pH and high HCO3. This is not the case here, as the pH is low and HCO3 is low. Respiratory Acidosis (Option C): This would be characterized by a low pH and high PCO2, not a low PCO2. The bicarbonate level would not be as low in a primary respiratory acidosis. Respiratory Alkalosis (Option D): This would show a high pH and low PCO2, but the bicarbonate level would be normal or compensatory high. In this case, the pH is low, and HCO3 is also low.

      "explanation": "is inversely proportional to the resistance of the vessel. According to the Hagen–Poiseuille equation, resistance can be directly measured by the following formula. R = 8hL/pr4 Where, R = resistance. h = viscosity. L = length. r = radius of the vessel. From this equation, the resistance of a vessel is inversely proportional to the fourth power of radius. So, if the radius is doubled the original and other parameters remain constant, then the resistance will be: R = 1/(r)4. R = 1/(2) 4. R = 1/16 = 16. So, the resistance will decrease by 16 times, and flow will increase by 16 times. Incorrect Options: Options A, C, and D are incorrect. Reference: .",

      "explanation": "volume. I-125 is a iodine labeled albumin that is injected into the bloodstream. It is impermeable to capillaries and does not dissociate into interstitial fluid and intracellular fluid. So, by measuring the dilution of the labeled albumin in the plasma, the total volume of plasma can be determined. Evan’s blue is another substance that can be used for determining plasma volume. Incorrect Options: Options B, C, and D are incorrect. I-125 labeled iodine is used to measure the plasma volume. Reference: .",

      "correct_answer": "D",
      "explanation": "illustrates feedback, not feedforward control. The heart rate elevates in response to immediate exercise demands, rather than anticipatorily preparing for changes. Incorrect Options: Option A - Temperature regulation: This is an example of a feedforward control mechanism. For instance, when the body anticipates exposure to cold temperatures, it may initiate processes like vasoconstriction and shivering to maintain or raise body temperature before it actually drops significantly. Option B - Cephalic phase of gastric secretion: The cephalic phase of gastric secretion is indeed a feedforward control mechanism. It occurs before food reaches the stomach, and sensory stimuli such as the sight and smell of food can trigger the release of gastric juices in anticipation of digestion. Option C - Cerebellar action in motor coordination: The cerebellum plays a significant role in motor coordination and is involved in feedforward control. It helps anticipate and make adjustments to muscle activities to coordinate movements effectively. Reference: .",
