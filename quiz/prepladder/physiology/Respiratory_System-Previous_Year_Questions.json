        "D": "Phosphatidylinositol"
      },
      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "distress syndrome (NRDS): It is primarily caused by a deficiency in surfactant. Surfactant is produced by Type II pneumocytes. Surfactant production begins by 20-24 weeks and matures by 35-37 weeks. Surfactant is a mixture of phospholipids, proteins, and ions. Dipalmitoyl phosphatidylcholine , surfactant apoproteins, and calcium ions are the most important components. (Option A) They are primarily responsible for reducing surface tension by partially dissolving in the fluid lining the alveolar surface while the rest spreads over the water's surface in the alveoli. Phospholipids Location Function Synthesis Significance Phosphatidylserine (Option B ruled out) Inner leaflet of the plasma membrane Involved in apoptosis . It flips to the outer leaflet of the plasma membrane, serving as a signal for phagocytes to engulf the dying cell. Synthesized in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) Plays a role in blood clotting by facilitating the binding of clotting factors. Supports neuronal function. Phosphatidylethanolamine (Option C ruled out) All cellular membranes Important for membrane fusion and the structural integrity of cellular membranes. Serves as a precursor for the synthesis of phosphatidylserine. Synthesized in the ER via the cytidine diphosphate-ethanolamine (CDP-ethanolamine) pathway or by decarboxylation of phosphatidylserine in the mitochondria. Plays a role in lipid metabolism and membrane dynamics. Deficiencies can impact cellular functions and are associated with various neurological disorders. Phosphatidylinositol (Option D ruled out) plasma membrane and intracellular membranes Involved in cell signaling pathways , particularly through the production of secondary messengers Plays a role in membrane trafficking and cytoskeletal organization. Produced in the ER and Golgi apparatus from CDP-DAG and inositol. Crucial for the function of insulin signaling and other receptor-mediated signal transduction pathways. Defects in phosphatidylinositol metabolism are linked to various diseases, including diabetes and cancer.

      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "pressure applied to the lungs and the corresponding volume of air in the lungs. This curve helps us understand the behavior of the lungs during inspiration and expiration. The pressure-volume curve of the lungs typically exhibits two phases: inflation and deflation. During the inflation phase: Initially, as the lung volume increases, the compliance of the lungs is high, meaning that the lungs easily expand with minimal changes in pressure. As the lung volume continues to increase, the compliance gradually decreases. This is due to the stretching of the lung tissue and the increasing resistance to expansion. At a certain point, the compliance reaches its lowest value, which is known as the lower inflection point. Beyond this point, the compliance increases again, indicating easier expansion of the lungs. During the deflation phase: Initially, as the lung volume decreases, the compliance remains relatively high, allowing the lungs to recoil passively. As the lung volume further decreases, the compliance starts to decrease again, indicating increasing resistance to deflation. At a certain point, the compliance reaches its highest value, which is known as the upper inflection point. Beyond this point, the compliance decreases again, indicating increasing resistance to deflation. The pressure-volume curve of the lungs can provide valuable information about lung mechanics and can be used to assess lung diseases or evaluate the effects of therapeutic",

      "correct_answer": "D",
      "explanation": "therapy may not be beneficial or effective. Central respiratory depression refers to a decrease or cessation of breathing due to a suppressed respiratory drive in the central nervous system. In such cases, providing oxygen alone may not stimulate the respiratory centers enough to overcome the underlying cause of respiratory depression. Incorrect Options: Option A: Asthma- Oxygen therapy can be beneficial in asthma exacerbations. In asthma, there is bronchoconstriction and inflammation of the airways, which can lead to reduced oxygen levels. Supplemental oxygen can help improve oxygenation and alleviate symptoms in individuals with asthma. Option B: Acute myocardial infarction- Oxygen therapy is commonly used in the management of acute myocardial infarction (heart attack). It helps to increase oxygen supply to the heart muscle and improve oxygenation in the body. Providing supplemental oxygen during an acute myocardial infarction can help reduce myocardial damage and improve outcomes. Option C: Pulmonary edema- This option is incorrect. Oxygen therapy is typically used in the management of pulmonary edema. Pulmonary edema is characterized by fluid accumulation in the lungs, leading to impaired gas exchange. Supplemental oxygen can help improve oxygenation and relieve respiratory distress in individuals with pulmonary edema. Reference: .",

CO poisoning: Carbon monoxide (CO) can lead to anemic hypoxia. CO has a strong affinity for hemoglobin, binding to it more readily than oxygen. This reduces the oxygen-carrying capacity of the blood, resulting in decreased oxygen delivery to the tissues. Option B. HCN poisoning: Hydrogen cyanide (HCN) poisoning can cause Histotoxic hypoxia. HCN inhibits cellular respiration by interfering with the electron transport chain, impairing the utilization of oxygen by the cells. Option C. Ischemia: Ischemia refers to inadequate blood flow to tissues, which can result in stagnant hypoxia. Reduced blood flow means less oxygen is delivered to the affected tissues, leading to hypoxia.

Incorrect options Option B. Zero: If the lung undergoes elastic recoil without the chest wall, it does not mean that the lung volume would reach zero. The lungs still have residual air and do not collapse completely. Option C . Functional residual capacity (FRC): FRC is the volume of air remaining in the lungs after a normal expiration, when the forces of lung recoil and chest wall expansion are in equilibrium. It is the volume at which the lung and chest wall exert equal but opposite forces. Option D. Residual volume: The residual volume is the volume of air that remains in the lungs after a maximal expiration. It represents the air that cannot be expelled from the lungs and serves to keep the alveoli open.",

      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: B) Type Il pneumocyte Explanation: Surfactant is a lipid-protein substance secreted by Type II pneumocytes in the alveoli of the lungs. Its primary function is to reduce surface tension within the alveoli, preventing alveolar collapse during exhalation and aiding in efficient gas exchange. Type II pneumocytes are specialized alveolar cells that secrete surfactant starting from approximately 24 weeks of gestation, with sufficient production by 35 weeks to support normal respiration. Clinical Insight: A deficiency of surfactant in premature neonates leads to neonatal respiratory distress syndrome (RDS) , characterized by difficulty in breathing and alveolar collapse. Surfactant replacement therapy is often used to treat this condition. Type I pneumocyte (Option A): Type I pneumocytes are involved in gas exchange and form the thin alveolar lining, but they do not secrete surfactant. Sertoli cell (Option C): Sertoli cells are found in the seminiferous tubules of the testes and play a role in sperm development (spermatogenesis). Leydig cell (Option D): Leydig cells are located in the testes and are responsible for producing testosterone.",

      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: A) B Explanation: Stored RBCs have reduced 2,3-BPG levels due to metabolic depletion during storage. 2,3-BPG normally promotes oxygen unloading by decreasing hemoglobin's affinity for oxygen. With low 2,3-BPG , hemoglobin binds oxygen more tightly , leading to a leftward shift (Curve B) in the oxygen-hemoglobin dissociation curve . This results in impaired oxygen delivery to tissues, as hemoglobin holds onto oxygen more strongly. Effects of Stored RBC Transfusion on the Dissociation Curve Factor Effect on O I Dissociation Curve Impact Low 2,3-BPG Leftward shift (B) Increased O I affinity, reduced unloading Acidosis Rightward shift Enhances oxygen unloading Alkalosis Leftward shift Increases oxygen binding Hypercapnia ( ↑ CO I ) Rightward shift Enhances oxygen release Hypothermia Leftward shift Decreases oxygen unloading C (Option B): Incorrect because stored RBCs initially reduce oxygen unloading (left shift) rather than increasing it. D (Option C): Incorrect because a linear curve does not reflect the physiological response to stored RBC transfusion. E (Option D): Incorrect because increased cooperativity does not explain the primary effect of stored RBC transfusion.",

      "explanation": "Correct Answer: B) 6 Explanation: MET (Metabolic Equivalent of Task) is a unit used to estimate energy expenditure during physical activity, defined as the ratio of metabolic rate during activity to resting metabolic rate. Formula to Calculate MET: MET = Oxygen consumption during exercise/ Resting oxygen consumption Given: Oxygen consumption during exercise = 1500 ml/min Resting oxygen consumption = 250 ml/min Calculation: MET = 1500 ml / min / 250 ml / min = 6 Thus, the MET score is 6 , indicating that the energy expenditure during exercise is 6 times higher than at rest. Factors affecting MET: Body weight: Heavier individuals generally have a higher absolute energy expenditure during physical activities than lighter individuals. Fitness level: More physically fit tend to have a more efficient cardiovascular system and improved oxygen utilization, resulting in lower energy expenditure for the same activity than individuals with lower fitness levels. Age: Generally, younger individuals have a higher metabolic rate and may expend more energy during physical activities than older individuals. Activity duration and intensity: Longer durations or higher intensity activities result in higher energy expenditure. Body composition: Individuals with a higher percentage of lean muscle mass typically have a higher metabolic rate and may expend more energy during physical activities. Environmental factors: Extreme temperatures or high altitudes can increase the body’s energy demands, leading to higher energy expenditure and potentially higher MET values.

      "explanation": "Correct Answer: B) Hypoxia Explanation: Peripheral chemoreceptors (carotid and aortic bodies) primarily respond to low arterial oxygen (PaO I ) . They are activated when PaO I falls below 60 mmHg , increasing ventilation to restore oxygen levels. While they also respond to hypercapnia and acidosis , the central chemoreceptors in the medulla are more sensitive to CO I and pH changes. Peripheral Chemoreceptors and Their Sensitivity Stimulus Effect on Peripheral Chemoreceptors Hypoxia ( ↓ PaO I ) Strongest stimulus , leading to increased ventilation.

Alkalosis ( ↑ pH) Minimal effect; detected mainly by central chemoreceptors. Hypercapnia (Option A): Incorrect because central chemoreceptors primarily regulate CO I levels, while peripheral chemoreceptors have a weaker response. Acidosis (Option C): Incorrect because although peripheral chemoreceptors detect acidosis, central chemoreceptors play a dominant role.

      "explanation": "Correct Answer: B) Bronchi Explanation: The medium to large-size bronchi, specifically the lobar and segmental bronchi, are the site of maximum resistance to airflow. This is because these bronchi have a relatively larger radius but are fewer in number, resulting in higher individual resistance. According to Poiseuille's law, resistance to airflow (R) is inversely proportional to the fourth power of the radius (r) of the airway. Resistance: R = 8 η L/ π r 4 Therefore, small changes in the radius result in significant changes in resistance. Despite the smaller radius of the bronchioles, their parallel arrangement results in a lower total resistance. Reference: Guyton and Hall-Textbook of Medical Physiology 14th Edition Pg 499",

      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "Correct answer: A) Anemic Hypoxia Explanation: Anemic hypoxia results from insufficient or impaired hemoglobin thus leading to decreased oxygen transport and causing hypoxia. Anemic Hypoxia Definition : Normal PO 2 of arterial blood but inadequate hemoglobin (Hb) to carry O 2 . Causes: Anaemia (decreased Hb concentration) Carbon monoxide (CO) poisoning Altered Hb (e.g., Methemoglobin) Mechanism: Normal PO 2 : PO 2 in inspired air and arterial blood is normal. Reduced O 2 Transport: Inadequate Hb reduces O 2 supply to tissues. Mild/Moderate Anemia: Increased 2,3-DPG in red cells compensates for low Hb; severe hypoxia during exercise. CO Poisoning: CO binds to Hb with 210 times greater affinity than O 2 , forming carboxyhemoglobin (COHb). Slow release of CO from COHb prevents O 2 binding. Normal Hb content, but Hb is unavailable for O 2 transport. Hb-dissociation curve shifts left, decreasing O 2 release to tissues. Incorrect Options: Hypoxic hypoxia (Option B): It is caused by low arterial PO 2 due to factors like high altitude or respiratory disease, not related to haemoglobin levels Stagnant hypoxia (Option C): It occurs due to reduced blood flow or cardiac output, causing inadequate tissue perfusion despite normal arterial PO 2 Histotoxic hypoxia (Option D): It Involves impaired cellular utilization of oxygen, often due to toxins, despite normal oxygen supply and delivery",

      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: B) Surface tension - increased; Compliance decreased Explanation: This statement is accurate regarding surface tension and compliance in a preterm baby with respiratory distress syndrome (RDS). Elastic tissue recoil and surface tension are the two opposing forces to lung compliance and are not opposing forces to each other. Two primary factors influence lung compliance: Elastic forces of the lung tissue : These forces are primarily determined by the presence of elastin and collagen fibers within the lung parenchyma (the functional tissue of the lungs). In a deflated lung, these fibers are contracted and kinked. As the lung expands during inspiration, these fibers stretch and unkink, generating an elastic force that opposes further expansion. Surface tension : A thin layer of fluid lines the inside of the alveoli. At the air-fluid interface within the alveoli, surface tension arises from the stronger attraction between water molecules compared to the attraction between water molecules and air molecules. This surface tension creates an inward pull, attempting to minimize the surface area of the fluid lining the alveoli. Consequently, this inward pull contributes to the elastic recoil of the lungs, making them tend to collapse Reference: Guyton 14th edition page 493-494 Pulmonary Compliance - StatPearls - NCBI Bookshelf",

      },
      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: C) Alkalosis Explanation: Alkalosis shifts the oxygen-hemoglobin dissociation curve to the left , meaning that hemoglobin holds onto oxygen more tightly and has a reduced tendency to release it to tissues. This is because at higher pH (alkalosis), hemoglobin's affinity for oxygen increases. Hypoxia (option A) : Hypoxia causes a rightward shift of the oxygen-Hb dissociation curve, facilitating oxygen release to tissues, as the body responds to low oxygen levels by decreasing hemoglobin's affinity for oxygen. Hypercarbia (option B) : Increased carbon dioxide (hypercarbia) also shifts the oxygen-Hb dissociation curve to the right , enhancing oxygen unloading to tissues to meet the increased metabolic demand. Increase in 2,3-DPG (option D) : An increase in 2,3-diphosphoglycerate (2,3-DPG) shifts the curve to the right , promoting oxygen release from hemoglobin to tissues, especially under conditions such as chronic hypoxia or anemia.

Type 1 pneumocyte (option A) : Type 1 pneumocytes are involved in the structural formation of the alveolar walls and are responsible for gas exchange, not surfactant production.
