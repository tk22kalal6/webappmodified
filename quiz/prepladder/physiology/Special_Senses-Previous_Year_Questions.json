      "explanation": "of sour taste. It detects acidic (sour) stimuli by responding to the presence of protons (H+ ions) in the food. Incorrect Options: Option A - T1R1 : This receptor is primarily associated with detecting umami taste, often in combination with T1R3. It does not play a role in sour taste perception. Option B - T1R2 : T1R2, along with T1R3, is involved in the perception of sweet taste. It is not responsible for detecting sour taste. Option C - T1R3 : T1R3 pairs with T1R1 for umami taste and with T1R2 for sweet taste. It is not involved in the perception of sour taste. Reference: .",

      "question": "Which tongue papillae does not have taste buds?",
      "options": {
        "A": "Fungiform",
        "B": "Filiform",
        "C": "Circumvallate",
        "D": "Foliate"

      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "contain taste buds. Their primary role is to provide a rough surface that helps with food manipulation and the sensation of texture, rather than taste perception. Option A - Fungiform: Fungiform papillae are mushroom-shaped and are found on the anterior part of the tongue. They contain taste buds that are sensitive to sweet, salty, sour, and umami flavors. Option C - Circumvallate: Circumvallate papillae are large, dome-shaped structures located at the back of the tongue in a V-shaped arrangement. Each papilla is surrounded by a trench and contains multiple taste buds, mainly sensitive to bitter flavors. Option D - Foliate: Foliate papillae are ridged structures located on the sides of the tongue. They contain taste buds and are particularly sensitive to sour flavors. Reference: .",

      "explanation": "detect vibration and deep pressure. They are rapidly adapting and are found deep in the dermis and subcutaneous tissue. Incorrect Options: Option A - Ruffini corpuscle - Stretching of the skin: Ruffini corpuscles are sensitive to stretching of the skin, particularly detecting skin stretch and contributing to the perception of object manipulation. Option B - Merkel cells - Sustained pressure and touch: Merkel cells are responsible for detecting Sustained pressure and touch : , providing fine tactile discrimination. They are slow-adapting receptors located in the skin and mucosa. Option C - Meissner’s corpuscle - Slow vibration Meissner’s corpuscles are sensitive to slow vibration and changes in texture. They are rapidly adapting receptors located in areas such as fingertips and lips, where precise touch is essential. Reference: Ganong's Review of Medical Physiology, 26th Edition, Page 158",

      "question": "A woman who suffered a sunburn while enjoying a vacation on the beach now experiences pain when lukewarm water (40°C) touches her back during a shower. What types of receptors were activated by the lukewarm water, and why did she experience pain?",
      "options": {
        "A": "Thermal nociceptors and nociceptive pain",
        "B": "Thermal nociceptors and allodynia",
        "C": "Innocuous thermal receptors and hyperalgesia",
        "D": "Innocuous thermal receptors and allodynia"
      },
      "correct_answer": "D",
      "explanation": "lukewarm water due to allodynia, where normally non-painful stimuli (like lukewarm water) become painful after a sunburn. The receptors activated were innocuous thermal receptors, which normally detect non-harmful temperatures, but their sensitivity was heightened due to the sunburn, leading to the sensation of pain. Incorrect Options: Option A - Thermal nociceptors and nociceptive pain: Thermal nociceptors are specialized receptors that respond to potentially damaging heat stimuli. They would typically be activated by high temperatures (>52°C) that are harmful or painful. Nociceptive pain refers to pain caused by the activation of nociceptors in response to harmful stimuli. However, in the case of lukewarm water (40°C), which is generally considered not too hot, the pain is more likely related to the sunburn rather than nociceptor activation due to the water temperature alone. Option B - Thermal nociceptors and allodynia: Thermal nociceptors are activated by extreme temperatures that are perceived as painful. Allodynia refers to pain caused by stimuli that do not usually provoke pain, such as lukewarm water touching sunburned skin. This option is plausible because the sensitivity of sunburned skin can make ordinarily non-painful stimuli painful. Option C - Innocuous thermal receptors and hyperalgesia: Innocuous thermal receptors respond to normal, non-painful temperatures. Hyperalgesia is an increased sensitivity to pain, where painful stimuli are perceived as more intense than usual. Although hyperalgesia can occur in sunburned skin, the involvement of innocuous thermal receptors is less likely for the described situation. Reference: .",

      "question": "A 30-year-old patient who was involved in a road traffic accident presents to the hospital with intense superficial pain in his hand due to the injury. Which type of nerve fiber must be selectively targeted to inhibit his pain?",
      "options": {
        "A": "A delta",
        "B": "A gamma",
        "C": "A alpha",
        "D": "C fibre"
      },
      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "fast, sharp, and localized pain signals. These fibers are involved in the initial perception of pain, often described as sharp and acute. Targeting A delta fibers would be effective in inhibiting intense superficial pain, such as the pain experienced due to a traumatic injury like a road traffic accident. Incorrect Options: Option B - A gamma fibers: A gamma fibers are motor fibers that innervate intrafusal muscle fibers within muscle spindles, playing a role in muscle tone regulation. These fibers are not directly involved in pain perception, so targeting them wouldn't be effective in inhibiting pain. Option C - A alpha fibers: A alpha fibers are motor fibers responsible for voluntary muscle movement. While they transmit proprioceptive and touch sensations from muscles, they are not primarily associated with transmitting pain signals. Targeting A alpha fibers wouldn't effectively inhibit pain. Option D - C fibers: C fibers are slow-conducting nerve fibers that transmit dull, aching, and chronic pain signals. They are involved in the secondary and prolonged phases of pain perception. These fibers are associated with longer-lasting, diffuse pain. While they contribute to pain perception, they are not responsible for the initial intense superficial pain experienced after a traumatic injury. Therefore, targeting C fibers wouldn't be the best choice to inhibit the specific type of pain described in the scenario.",

      "question": "Which of the following statement is accurate regarding a 50-year-old male who was diagnosed with a submandibular gland tumor, underwent tumor removal, and subsequently experienced damage to the lingual nerve?",
      "options": {
        "A": "The taste sensation of the posterior one-third of the tongue is lost",
        "B": "The taste sensation of the anterior two-thirds of the tongue is lost",
        "C": "A general sensation of the posterior one-third of the tongue is lost",
        "D": "A general sensation of the anterior two-thirds of the tongue is lost"
      },
      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: A general sensation of the anterior two-thirds of the tongue is lost Explanation: The lingual nerve , a branch of the mandibular division of the trigeminal nerve (CN V3), plays a crucial role in providing general sensation (touch, pain, and temperature) to the anterior two-thirds of the tongue . It also carries taste fibers from the chorda tympani (a branch of the facial nerve, CN VII) responsible for taste in this region. Damage to the lingual nerve disrupts the sensory fibers responsible for the general sensation of the anterior two-thirds of the tongue. This is the most reliable symptom after lingual nerve damage. Clinical Insight: During submandibular gland surgery, the lingual nerve is at risk due to its anatomical proximity. Postoperative complications often include: Loss of general sensation in the anterior two-thirds of the tongue. Occasionally, taste loss in the same area if the chorda tympani is also injured. The taste sensation of the posterior one-third of the tongue is lost (Option A): The posterior one-third of the tongue is innervated by the glossopharyngeal nerve (CN IX) for both general and taste sensations. This region is not affected by lingual nerve damage. The taste sensation of the anterior two-thirds of the tongue is lost (Option B): While the lingual nerve carries chorda tympani fibers (responsible for taste), taste loss depends on whether the chorda tympani is also damaged. General sensation loss is more consistent with lingual nerve injury. A general sensation of the posterior one-third of the tongue is lost (Option C): The general sensation of the posterior one-third of the tongue is supplied by the glossopharyngeal nerve (CN IX) and is unaffected by lingual nerve injury.
