      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: B) Simultaneous activation of innocuous cutaneous mechanoreceptors Explanation: Rubbing or shaking an injured area decreases the pain due to the injury. This is due to simultaneous activation of innocuous cutaneous mechanoreceptors thereby reducing pain by affecting dorsal horn neuron responsiveness. This is called the gate-control mechanism of pain modulation. Gate control theory: Developed By Patrick David Wall and Ronald Melzack It suggests that pain perception is influenced by the interaction of different nerve fibers in the spinal cord. Large-diameter A α and A β fibers inhibit pain signals from C fibers in the dorsal horn of spinal cord by activating inhibitory interneurons, effectively \"closing the gate\". ( Option C, D ruled out) When small-diameter fibers are more active, they \"open the gate,\" allowing pain signals to reach the brain. Influencing Factors: Psychological factors, including cognitive and emotional states affect gate control. Depression can keep the gate open more often, increasing pain perception Unhealthy lifestyles can also result in open gates. Application: According to the gate-control theory, electrical stimulation of large nerve fibers should inhibit pain induced by C fibers alone. Transcutaneous Electrical Nerve Stimulation (TENS) uses electrodes to activate Aa and Aß fibers near the injury, thereby using the gate-control mechanism for pain relief. Acupuncture. Analgesic systems: Target/Mechanism Description Opioids Reduce pain by acting at multiple levels of the nervous system. They act at Spinal Cord, Dorsal Root Ganglia, Periaqueductal Grey (PAG) Opioids inhibit pain transmission by activating receptors, reducing calcium influx, and promoting inhibitory neurotransmitter release. TRPV1 Receptors Targeted by capsaicin, involved in sensing heat and inflammatory pain; can deplete substance P to reduce pain. Voltage-Gated Sodium Channels Blocked by local anesthetics like lidocaine and mexiletine, crucial for action potential generation in nociceptors. The Nav1.8 subtype is a target for chronic pain management. Voltage-Gated Calcium Channels Blocked by drugs like ziconotide, gabapentin, and topiramate, reducing",

      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Correct answer: C) Frequency coding principle Explanation: The principle shown here is the Frequency Coding Principle. The Frequency Coding Principle states that the intensity of a stimulus is encoded by the frequency of action potentials generated in the afferent fibers. As pressure increases, the firing rate of action potentials in the mechanoreceptor increases, conveying information about the strength of the stimulus Action potentials in an afferent fiber from a mechanoreceptor of a single sensory unit increase in frequency as branches of the afferent neuron are stimulated by pressure of increasing magnitude. Labelled Line Principle (Option A) refers to the idea that specific pathways in the nervous system convey specific types of sensory information. Weber-Fechner Law (Option B) relates to the perception of changes in stimulus intensity and the relationship between the actual change and perceived change. Concept of Specific Nerve Energy (Option D) suggests that each type of sensory nerve fiber is dedicated to a specific type of sensory information, regardless of how it is activated.",

      "explanation": "Correct answer: C) Merkel’s disc Explanation: The figure marked with B represents Merkel's disc The human hand contains four types of mechanoreceptors that work together to sense contact with objects: Merkel cells and Ruffini endings: Activate for steady pressure. Meissner and Pacinian corpuscles: Activate for tingling and vibratory sensations. Location of a stimulus is encoded by spatial distribution of the population of receptors activated. A receptor fires only when the skin close to its sensory terminals is touched. The receptive fields of mechanoreceptors (shown as red areas on fingertips) differ in size and response to touch. Merkel cells and Meissner corpuscles provide the most precise localization as they have the smallest receptive fields and are most sensitive to pressure applied by a small probe. Stimulus intensity is signaled by firing rates of individual receptors; duration of stimulus is signaled by time course of firing. The spike trains indicate action potentials elicited by pressure from a small probe at the center of each receptive field. Meissner and Pacinian corpuscles adapt rapidly, the others adapt slowly Accommodation: Refers to a gradual increase in threshold caused by prolonged slowly rising sub-threshold nerve depolarization, resulting from the inactivation of sodium channels. Adaptation: If a supra-threshold stimulus persists unchanged for several minutes without a change in position or amplitude, the neural response diminishes and sensation is lost, a condition called receptor adaptation.",

      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: C) Hyperactive muscle spindles Explanation: The patient's history of multiple sclerosis and the presence of ankle clonus strongly suggest damage to the descending motor pathways. This damage leads to hyperactive muscle spindles and, consequently, clonus. Clonus is characterized by rhythmic muscle contractions in response to sustained stretch. CLONUS Definition Regular, repetitive, rhythmic contractions of a muscle subjected to sudden, maintained stretch Cause Increased γ -motor neuron activity leading to hypersensitive muscle spindles Mechanism Hypersensitivity to stretch triggers rhythmic contractions Common Sites Ankle clonus initiated by brisk, maintained dorsiflexion of the foot, leading to rhythmic plantar flexion Associated Conditions Damage to descending motor pathways Traumatic brain injury Brain tumors Strokes Multiple sclerosis Spinal cord injury Renshaw Cells Inhibitory interneurons receiving excitatory input from α -motor neurons Damage leads to loss of inhibitory control, contributing to clonus Reflexes Involved Stretch reflex Inverse stretch reflex Interplay in hypersensitive muscle spindles contributes to clonus Increased GABAergic activity (Option B) in the spinal cord would actually reduce clonus as GABA is an inhibitory neurotransmitter.

      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "muscle. Correct Answer: B) To prevent muscle damage by causing reflex inhibition of the contracting muscle. Explanation: The Golgi tendon organ, when activated by excessive muscle tension, triggers a protective reflex that inhibits the contracting muscle, preventing tendon rupture or muscle tearing. Golgi tendon organ Location and Structure Muscle tendons. Encapsulated sensory receptors. Around 10-15 muscle fibers are connected. Stimulus Tension in the muscle, as reflected by tension in the tendon. Sudden, strong muscle contractions increase tension in the tendon Function Control and prevent excessive muscle tension. Operates as a negative feedback system. Reflex Pathway When stimulated, signals are transmitted to the spinal cord, triggering the inverse stretch reflex (also called autogenic inhibition). The signal activates an inhibitory interneuron in the spinal cord. The interneuron inhibits the anterior motor neuron of the respective muscle, causing relaxation, this is a bisynaptic pathway. This protects the muscle and tendon from excessive tension that might cause tearing. Afferent Fiber Golgi tendon organ to the spinal cord via large, fast-conducting type Ib nerve fibers.

      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "γ -motor neuron Correct Answer: B) γ -motor neuron Explanation: The Jendrassik maneuver, which can involve actions such as clenching the teeth or pulling on the hands, activates γ -motor neurons. γ -motor neurons, also called gamma efferent fibers, innervate intrafusal muscle fibers. Muscle contraction Feature Direct Indirect Definition Occurs when α -motor neurons are directly stimulated. Occurs when the muscle spindle is activated, leading to the activation of α -motor neurons via the stretch reflex pathway. Pathway Monosynaptic Monosynaptic Purpose Voluntary movements Involuntary, provides damping to smooth muscle contractions. Example Picking up an object. Maintaining posture, reacting to unexpected changes in load on a muscle (e.g., catching a ball). Jendrassik Maneuver: Clinical technique used to enhance the sensitivity of the stretch reflex (and thus, the response of the muscle spindle). The maneuver involves the patient performing an isometric contraction in a muscle group distant from the one being tested. Clenching the teeth Locking the fingers and pulling the hands apart Squeezing the knees together. The maneuver is thought to increase γ -motor neuron activity, making the muscle spindles more sensitive to stretch. Alpha-Gamma Coactivation: On voluntary muscle contraction, the brain often signals both α - and γ -motor neurons simultaneously. This is known as alpha-gamma coactivation. Activating γ -motor neurons causes intrafusal fibers to contract, maintaining tension in the spindle ensuring that spindle remains sensitive to stretch even during voluntary contractions. Example: When catching a ball, alpha-gamma coactivation keeps the muscle spindles responsive and allows for rapid adjustments to maintain grip and arm position as the weight of the ball impacts the hand. α -motor neuron (Option A): While the knee-jerk reflex does involve the activation of α -motor neurons to cause the quadriceps muscle to contract, the Jendrassik maneuver does not directly activate these neurons. Golgi tendon organ (Option C): the sensitivity of the Golgi tendon organ is not directly affected by the Jendrassik maneuver. Extrafusal muscle fibers (Option D) are not directly activated by the Jendrassik maneuver. Reference: Ganong’s Review of Medical Physiology, 26th Edition, Page 228.",

Muscle Spindles: Consists of intrafusal muscle fibers (nuclear bag and nuclear chain fibers), Sensory nerve endings (group Ia and II afferent fibers), and Gamma motor neuron endings Afferent Limb: When a muscle is stretched, the muscle spindles are also stretched, stimulating the sensory endings. This stretch-induced stimulation generates receptor potentials that trigger action potentials in the afferent fibers. Integration Center: The Ia afferent fibers, have a large diameter and, conduct action potentials, transmit signals to the spinal cord through the dorsal roots. Within the spinal cord, these fibers form direct (monosynaptic) connections with alpha motor neurons located in the anterior horn. Efferent Limb: The activated alpha motor neurons send signals through axons, which exit the spinal cord and travel to the extrafusal muscle fibers. Effector: The arrival of action potentials at the neuromuscular junctions causes the release of acetylcholine, initiating muscle fiber contraction.

      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "cord. Correct Answer: A) Periaqueductal grey (PAG) neurons - endorphins in the dorsal horn of the spinal cord. Explanation: The periaqueductal grey (PAG) matter region in the midbrain plays a crucial role in the descending pain modulation pathway. When stimulated by opioids like morphine, PAG neurons activate neurons in the brainstem, the nucleus raphe magnus (which releases serotonin) and the rostral ventromedial medulla (which releases norepinephrine). These neurons project to the dorsal horn, where they release their respective neurotransmitters to inhibit the activity of pain-transmitting neurons. Brain Region Neurotransmitter Released Site Effect Periaqueductal grey (PAG) Endorphins Dorsal horn of the spinal cord Inhibits pain transmission by activating enkephalin-containing interneurons. Nucleus raphe magnus Activates neurons that release serotonin. Rostral ventromedial medulla Activates neurons that release norepinephrine. Periventricular region (PV) Endorphins Raphe Magnus nucleus Activates neurons that release serotonin. (Option B and D ruled out) Periventricular nucleus neurons - enkephalins in the rostral ventromedial medulla (Option C) is not true as PAG does not directly release serotonin; it activates serotonergic neurons in the nucleus raphe magnus.

      "explanation": "Correct Answer: D) Pacinian corpuscles Explanation: Pacinian receptors are rapidly adapting receptors sensitive to vibrations and rapid pressure changes Adaptation of receptors: One of the most important characteristics of sensory receptors is that they can adapt partially or completely to any constant stimulus after a period of time. When a continuous stimulus is applied to a receptor, the initial response occurs at a high impulse rate, then at a progressively slower rate, which ultimately decreases to very few or none at all. Mechanism: Adaptation occurs in 2 ways : 1 In Rapidly Adapting Receptors It is a faster mechanism. The receptors are viscoelastic in nature so that when a stimulus is applied to one side of the receptor, it is transmitted instantly by the viscous component to the same side of the central nerve fiber, eliciting a response Within a few seconds, the fluid in the receptors redistributes and the response is no longer elicited 2 In Slowly Adapting Receptors It is a slower mechanism called accommodation This occurs directly in the nerve fiber. If there is a continued stimulus, then the tip of the receptor becomes accommodated to the stimulus. This occurs from the progressive inactivation of sodium channels in the nerve fiber membrane. Rapidly adapting receptors Pacinian, Meissner’s and hearing organ Slow adapting receptors Merkel’s, Ruffini’s and free nerve endings (Option A & C ruled out) Meissner’s corpuscles (Option B) are also rapidly adapting receptors but are sensitive to light touch rather than vibrations.",

It is a local, non-propagated change in membrane potential that occurs in response to a stimulus. Receptor potential is not an action potential; instead, it causes the sensory neuron to fire action potentials.

        "A": "Cold receptors: myelinated type C fibers",
        "B": "Warmth receptors: myelinated type A",
        "C": "Cold receptors: myelinated type A",
        "D": "Warmth receptors: myelinated type A"

      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "δ fibers Correct Answer: C) Cold receptors: myelinated type A δ fibers Explanation: Cold receptors primarily use small, myelinated type A δ fibers to transmit signals, which conduct at a speed of approximately 20 m/sec. Types of Thermoreceptors Type Location Transmission Pathway Speed Cold Receptors (Option C) Under the skin at spots Type A δ fibers (myelinated), some Type C fibers (unmyelinated) (Option A ruled out) ~20 m/sec (A δ fibers) Warmth Receptors (Option B&D Ruled out) Under the skin at spots Unmyelinated Type C fibers 0.4-2 m/sec The body has 3 - 10 times more cold spots (lips >>fingers) than warmth spots Nocireceptors / Pain receptors are stimulated only in extreme degrees of cold or heat and are responsible along with the cold and warmth receptors for freezing cold and burning hot sensations. Stimulation of Thermal Receptors Type of Nerve Fiber Temperature Range Cold Receptors 10-40°C (peak ~24°C) Warmth Receptors >30°C (fade ~49°C) Cold Pain Fibers Very cold temperatures Heat Pain Fibers Start ~45°C Thermal Signal Pathway Transmitted in parallel pathways with pain signals. Signals travel in the tract of Lissauer and terminate in laminae I, II, and III of dorsal horns. Processed signals by cord neurons cross to the opposite anterolateral sensory tract and terminate in both brain stem's reticular areas and the thalamus's ventrobasal complex. Removal of cortical postcentral gyrus reduces, but does not eliminate, temperature distinction ability.",
