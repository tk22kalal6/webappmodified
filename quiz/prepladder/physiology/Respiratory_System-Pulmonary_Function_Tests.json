      },
      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "obesity, and smoking. Correct Answer: C) Increased CV is seen in conditions such as ageing, obstructive lung diseases, obesity, and smoking. Explanation: Closing Volume (CV) Definition: Closing Volume (CV) is the lung volume at which small airways begin to close during expiration, particularly in the dependent parts of the lungs. (Option A ruled out) CV = Closing capacity - Residual volume. Mechanism: During expiration, as lung volume decreases, pleural pressure becomes less negative. At the closing volume, airway pressure drops below pleural pressure, causing small airways to close. Measurement: Single-Breath Nitrogen Washout Test: This test measures CV by observing the washout of nitrogen from the lungs during a single breath. Clinical Implications: Increased CV: Indicates small airway dysfunction and can be seen in: (Option D ruled out) Ageing: Decreased elastic recoil and increased lung compliance. Obstructive Lung Diseases: COPD and asthma. Obesity and Pregnancy: Reduced lung volumes and diaphragmatic changes. Smoking: Indicates early small airway dysfunction. Closing Capacity (CC): Definition: Closing Capacity (CC) is the lung volume at which the basal alveoli begin to close off during expiration. It is the sum of the closing and residual volumes (CC = CV + RV). Mechanism: During forceful expiration, the volume at which only the basal alveoli are closed off is known as closing capacity. Further expiration will eventually lead to all alveoli being closed off, reaching the residual volume. Clinical Implications: Ageing: Functional residual capacity (FRC) is greater than CC in a normal adult. By around 66 years of age, FRC is nearly equal to CC, indicating that CC increases gradually with age. Pathological Implications: If CC significantly exceeds FRC, it indicates highly collapsible lung diseases, such as hyaline membrane disease. Measurement : Single-Breath Nitrogen Washout Method (Fowler's) measures CC and anatomical dead space by observing nitrogen washout during a single breath. (Option B ruled out)",

      "question": "A 60-year-old man with a history of smoking presents with shortness of breath. During spirometry, dynamic compression of the airways is observed during forceful expiration. Which of the following statements best describes the point at which dynamic compression occurs?",
      "options": {
        "A": "Early expiration, high lung volume.",
        "B": "Mid expiration, FRC reached.",
        "C": "Late expiration, pleural pressure > airway pressure.",
        "D": "End expiration, near RV."
      },
      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "when intrathoracic pressure (pleural pressure) exceeds airway pressure. This leads to airway narrowing or collapse, particularly in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), with increased resistance and decreased elastic recoil. Mechanism: During forceful expiration, elastic tissues in the alveoli help in passive expiration by recoiling inward. As air moves through the bronchi and bronchioles, airway resistance causes the pressure to drop. An external force from the chest wall also acts on the bronchi and bronchioles. At the end of expiration, the pressure inside the bronchioles equals the external pressure, known as the equal pressure point. Dynamic compression does not occur during the early expiration phase when the lung volume is still relatively high; the surrounding lung tissue generally supports the airways well. (Option A) Dynamic compression is not associated with functional residual capacity (FRC) but occurs later when airway and pleural pressures interact. (Option B) When reaching the residual volume (RV) by the end of expiration, dynamic compression is less of a concern, as the airflow has largely ceased.

      "question": "A healthy 35-year-old male undergoes pulmonary function tests as part of a routine health check-up. Which of the following findings is most likely to be observed?",

        "D": "Vital capacity 3500 ml"
      },
      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: C) Residual volume 1200 ml Explanation: A residual volume of 1200 ml is normal for a healthy 35-year-old male. Residual volume remains stable unless there is a pathological condition affecting lung function, and it helps differentiate between obstructive and restrictive lung diseases: Obstructive lung diseases (e.g., COPD) increase residual volume due to air trapping. Restrictive lung diseases (e.g., pulmonary fibrosis) decrease residual volume due to reduced lung compliance. Additionally, residual volume can differentiate between types of restrictive lung diseases: Parenchymal restrictive lung disease (e.g., pulmonary fibrosis) shows highly reduced residual volume due to stiff and scarred lung tissue. Extra-parenchymal restrictive lung disease (e.g., neuromuscular diseases, chest wall deformities) may show normal or slightly reduced residual volume, as the issue is outside the lung tissue, affecting breathing mechanics rather than the lung parenchyma. Key parameters of pulmonary function tests: Spirometry Forced Vital Capacity (FVC) Total air exhaled forcefully after deep breath. Approximately 4-6 liters (depending on age, sex, height, and weight) Forced Expiratory Volume in 1 Second (FEV 1 ) Air exhaled in the first second of the FVC manoeuvre. Approximately 80% of FVC FEV 1 /FVC Ratio Percentage of FVC exhaled in the first second. Approximately 70-80% Peak Expiratory Flow (PEF) Maximum speed of expiration. Varies by age, sex, and height (e.g., 400-600 L/min for adults) Lung Volumes Total Lung Capacity (TLC) The total volume of air in the lungs after maximal inhalation Approximately 6-8 liters Residual Volume (RV) Air remaining in the lungs after maximal exhalation Approximately 1.2-1.5 litres Vital Capacity (VC) Air that can be exhaled after maximal inhalation (FVC minus RV) Approximately 4-5 liters Inspiratory Reserve Volume (IRV) Additional air inhaled after normal inhalation Approximately 2-3 liters Expiratory Reserve Volume (ERV) Additional air exhaled after normal exhalation Approximately 1-1.5 liters Diffusing Capacity (DLCO) Lung’s ability to transfer gases (e.g., CO) Approximately 20-30 mL/min/mmHg The other options (A, B, and D) are also within normal ranges for healthy adults but are less specific to routine findings in pulmonary function tests compared to residual volume.

More sensitive marker of airway disease (particularly for the obstruction of smaller-sized airways) than traditional parameters like FEV1, FEV1/FVC ratio, or PEFR. PEFR (Option A) – Less sensitive as it reflects large airway function and can remain normal in early small airway disease. FEV1 (Option B) – Commonly used but detects moderate-to-severe airway obstruction , making it less sensitive for early disease. FEV1/FVC Ratio (Option C) – Helps diagnose obstructive lung diseases , but may not detect early small airway dysfunction as well as MMEFR.
