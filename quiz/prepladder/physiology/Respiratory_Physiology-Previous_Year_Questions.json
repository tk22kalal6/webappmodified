      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: A) Potassium (K+) Explanation: The ion primarily involved in the function of O I -sensitive channels in peripheral chemoreceptors is Potassium (K I ) . These channels play a crucial role in oxygen sensing within the carotid bodies, which are the main chemoreceptor sites for detecting changes in blood oxygen levels. When oxygen levels drop, the O I -sensitive potassium channels close , leading to cell depolarization and the subsequent release of neurotransmitters that signal the brain to increase respiration and blood pressure to maintain oxygen homeostasis I Sodium (Na I ) (Option B): is not directly involved in the O2-sensitive channels. They play a different role in other cellular processes but are not the key ions for oxygen sensitivity in peripheral chemoreceptors. Calcium (Ca++) (Option C): is not directly involved in the O2-sensitive channels. Chloride (Cl I ) (Option D): does not play a direct role in the functioning of O2-sensitive channels in peripheral chemoreceptors. Reference: https://www.mdpi.com/2673-9801/4/1/4",

      "explanation": "describes the initial phase of a cough. The cough reflex begins with a deep inhalation, followed by the closure of the glottis (the opening between the vocal cords). The expiratory muscles then contract forcefully, increasing the pressure in the chest. When the glottis suddenly opens, the built-up pressure is released, producing a forceful expulsion of air and any irritants in the airway. Removing harmful substances: Coughing clears the respiratory tract of irritants, such as mucus, dust, smoke, or other harmful substances. This is a protective reflex mechanism aimed at keeping the airways clear and preventing the aspiration of foreign materials. Expiration against an open glottis (Statement 2): happens during sneezing.

It involves inhaling pure oxygen and then exhaling slowly and steadily. The alveolar oxygen is mixed with the nitrogen whereas the air in the anatomical dead space is free of nitrogen containing only oxygen thus measuring the anatomical dead space Multiple breath nitrogen test (Option A): It is used for measuring the residual volume. Bohr's method (Option B): it is used for measuring the physiological dead space. Spirometry (Option C): is a commonly used test to assess lung function and measure various parameters such as forced vital capacity (FVC), forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1), and peak expiratory flow rate (PEFR).

      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "excursion to a high-altitude mountain region. At higher altitudes, the partial pressure of oxygen (PaO2) decreases due to the lower atmospheric pressure. This can lead to a hypoxia, where there's a reduced availability of oxygen for the body's cells and tissues. Changes during Acclimatization in high altitudes Respiratory At high altitudes, lower oxygen levels stimulate peripheral chemoreceptors, increasing pulmonary ventilation. (Option D ruled out) This leads to enhanced CO2 removal, causing respiratory alkalosis. Kidneys respond by excreting more bicarbonate to stabilize blood pH, causing a sustained increase in ventilation and supporting prolonged acclimatization. Haematological At high altitudes, lower PO2 boosts erythropoietin production, increasing red blood cell count. (Option B ruled out) This also raises 2,3-diphosphoglycerate (2,3-DPG) levels in red blood cells. Initially, alkalosis shifts the oxyhemoglobin dissociation curve to the left but increased 2,3-DPG shifts it to the right, improving oxygen release to tissues. Cardiovascular Hypoxia activates the sympathoadrenal axis, increasing heart rate, cardiac output, and blood pressure. Increased cardiac output leads to an increase in blood flow, and hypoxia causes vasodilation in the systemic circulation, further contributing to increased blood flow and oxygen supply to the tissues. Tissue In acclimatization, skeletal muscles undergo several changes, including an increase in the number of capillaries and mitochondria and an increase in myoglobin content. (Option C ruled out) Further, chemicals released from the hypoxic tissues stimulate angiogenesis.

      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "for storing and delivering oxygen to the muscle tissue. The oxygen dissociation curve for myoglobin is hyperbolic, because in the case of myoglobin, one molecule of hemoglobin binds with one molecule of oxygen, and complete saturation will occur. Therefore, a sudden increase in saturation can be seen in a myoglobin curve. Myoglobin-O2 dissociation curve: The oxygen dissociation curve for myoglobin is rectangular hyperbolic . This is because, in the case of myoglobin, one molecule of haemoglobin binds with one molecule of oxygen with high affinity, and complete saturation will occur. Unlike haemoglobin, which has a sigmoidal curve due to cooperative binding among its four subunits, myoglobin's curve does not exhibit cooperativity. This means myoglobin can efficiently bind and release oxygen at varying partial pressures, making it well-suited for oxygen storage in muscle tissues. Carboxyhemoglobinemia (Option B): Carboxyhemoglobinemia shifts the oxygen dissociation curve to the left and markedly reduces the oxygen dissociation. Methemoglobin (Option C): Methemoglobin is a form of hemoglobin that has been oxidized and can no longer bind to oxygen effectively due to ferric state or iron. Fetal hemoglobin (Option D) : Fetal hemoglobin has a higher affinity for oxygen than adult hemoglobin. This shifts the oxygen dissociation curve to the left as marked by B.",

This response is known as respiratory compensation. Relationship Between Minute Ventilation (MV) and Arterial Carbon Dioxide Tension (PaCO2) Key Highlights Graphical Trend : MV increases inversely with PaCO2 to maintain acid-base balance. High PaCO2 lowers blood pH (acidosis), triggering increased ventilation to expel CO2 and restore pH. Effects of pH on MV and PaCO2 Physiological Regulation : CO2 combines with water to form carbonic acid, dissociating into bicarbonate and hydrogen ions, lowering pH. Chemoreceptors detect pH changes and adjust MV to normalize CO2 levels.

Respiratory changes in high altitude: Incorrect Options: Alkaline Urine (Option A): In response to respiratory alkalosis, the kidneys excrete bicarbonate (HCO3-) to help restore the body's pH balance, making the urine alkaline. Polycythemia (Option B) : Hypoxia triggers the release of erythropoietin, which stimulates red blood cell production, leading to polycythemia to enhance the oxygen-carrying capacity of the blood.

Luebering- Rapoport Pathway The Luebering-Rapoport pathway produces 2,3-BPG, which binds to hemoglobin and decreases its affinity for oxygen, facilitating oxygen release to tissues. Bisphosphoglycerate mutase enzyme initiates the Luebering-Rapoport pathway. Balance between bisphosphoglycerate mutase and bisphosphoglycerate phosphatase enzyme determines the amount of 2,3-BPG present in blood. 2,3-BPG causes right shifting of OHDC by stabilising the lower affinity of hemoglobin for oxygen. One molecule of hemoglobin binds with one molecule of 2,3-BPG which is a byproduct of glycolytic pathway Chronic acidosis maintained for a long time inhibits the bisphosphoglycerate mutase enzyme which decreases the 2,3-BPG content of blood leading to left shifting of OHDC. The Luebering-Rapoport pathway diverts from the ATP-producing steps of glycolysis,resulting in net decrease in ATP yield because it consumes ATP.

Oxygen-Haemoglobin Dissociation Curve: The oxygen-haemoglobin dissociation curve represents the relationship between the partial pressure of oxygen (PO 2 ) and the percentage of haemoglobin saturated with oxygen (SaO 2 ). Key Points: Sigmoid Shape: Reflects varying Hb affinity for oxygen at different PO 2 levels. Steep Phase: Rapid increase in Hb saturation with PO 2 . Plateau Phase: Minimal change in Hb saturation despite large changes in PO 2 . Phases: Steep phase Plateau phase Range 10-60 mm Hg 60-100 mm Hg Characteristics A rapid increase in Hb saturation. Hb ~90% saturated at PO 2 of 60 mm Hg. Curve flattens. Small increases in Hb saturation despite PO 2 rise. Significance Curve flattens. Small increases in Hb saturation despite PO 2 rise. It provides a safety buffer. It maintains high Hb saturation (~90%) despite moderate PO 2 decreases. It ensures stable oxygen delivery under varying conditions. P 50 : P 50 is the level of PO 2 at which 50% of haemoglobin is saturated with oxygen. P 50 assesses the binding affinity of haemoglobin for oxygen. In adults at sea level, the normal P 50 occurs at a PO 2 of 27 mm Hg. Alteration in the P 50 value has a greater impact on the steep phase of the curve. If P 50 is high, it signifies a decrease in Hb's affinity for oxygen, which is seen in the right shift of the oxygen hemoglobin equilibrium curve. Conversely, if P 50 is low, it signifies a shift of the curve to the left, in which Hb's affinity for oxygen increases.

Facilitates oxygen release: The increased 2,3-BPG concentration decreases haemoglobin's affinity for oxygen, making it release oxygen more readily to the tissues. Optimises and promotes better oxygen delivery: The higher P 50 levels in CPDA-1 indicate a rightward shift of the hemoglobin-oxygen dissociation curve, enhancing oxygen release to tissues. Preservation Properties: CPDA-1 is commonly used to store whole blood and red blood cells due to its superior preservation properties: Citrate: Acts as an anticoagulant by binding calcium and preventing clotting. Phosphate: Helps maintain pH balance and provides a source of cell energy. Dextrose: Is a nutrient that the red blood cells can metabolize for energy. Adenine: Is crucial for maintaining ATP levels, essential for cell energy and longevity. Benefits: The combination of these components in CPDA-1 allows it to preserve blood for up to 35 days, which is longer than other anticoagulants and preservative solutions like ACD, EDTA, and CPD. This makes CPDA-1 an ideal solution for storing blood for medical use. Reference: Ganong's Review of Medical Physiology, 26th Edition, page 632 CPDA- Pubmed",
