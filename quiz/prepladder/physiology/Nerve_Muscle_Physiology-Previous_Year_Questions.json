      "correct_answer": "D",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: D) 1,2,4 Explanation: Neuromuscular transmission initiates muscle contraction by releasing acetylcholine (ACh) at the neuromuscular junction. Excitation-contraction coupling propagates the action potential along the T-tubules and triggers Ca² I release from the sarcoplasmic reticulum. Transmission impulse from the nerve carries the action potential along the motor neuron to stimulate the muscle. Latent Period of Muscle Twitch Process Role in Latent Period Neuromuscular transmission ACh release at the neuromuscular junction triggers muscle fiber depolarization. Excitation-contraction coupling Action potential spreads through T-tubules, leading to Ca² I release. Nerve impulse transmission Action potential travels along the motor neuron to reach the muscle. 1, 2 (Option A): Incorrect because nerve impulse transmission is a crucial step before neuromuscular transmission and excitation-contraction coupling. 1, 2, 3 (Option B): Incorrect because reuptake of calcium into the sarcoplasmic reticulum occurs during the relaxation phase, not the latent period. 1, 4 (Option C): Incorrect because excitation-contraction coupling is essential for Ca² I release, and without it, contraction cannot occur.

This leads to the summation of inputs, allowing the postsynaptic neuron to integrate and respond to multiple inputs. In this clinical scenario, the neuron is receiving 400 inputs from 150 sensory neurons, which fits the definition of convergence. Incorrect Options: Divergence (Option A): Occurs when one neuron sends its output to multiple neurons, not the other way around. Feedback inhibition (Option C): This refers to a regulatory mechanism where the output of a neuron inhibits its own activity or the activity of upstream neurons Feedforward system (Option D): This refers to a mechanism where a neuron sends signals that facilitate or prepare for a future action, often without the influence of previous outputs Reference: https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5488793/",

      },
      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: C) Gate Control Theory Explanation: The Gate control theory , developed by Patrick Wall and Ronald Melzack, explains that pain perception is modulated by the interaction between different nerve fibers in the spinal cord. Large-diameter A α and A β fibers inhibit the transmission of pain signals from small-diameter C fibers in the dorsal horn of the spinal cord by activating inhibitory interneurons , effectively \"closing the gate\" to pain. TENS works by stimulating these large-diameter fiber s, reducing pain perception through this mechanism. Incorrect Options: Central inhibition (Option A): Refers to the reduction of pain processing at the central nervous system level, but TENS primarily works via spinal cord modulation (gate control), not central inhibition. Desensitization (Option B): Involves the reduction in the sensitivity of pain receptors over time, but is not the primary mechanism of TENS. Descending inhibition (Option D): Involves pain inhibition through descending pathways from the brain, which is a different mechanism from gate control.

      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: B) 1 and 3 Explanation: Extracellular Ca 2+ is not essential for skeletal muscle contraction as calcium primarily comes from the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR). The release of Ca 2+ from the SR is crucial for muscle contraction, while voltage-gated Ca 2+ channels on the sarcolemma play a role in excitation-contraction coupling. Sequential events during muscle contraction Release of calcium ions from the sarcoplasmic reticulum An action potential triggers the release of calcium ions (Ca² I ) from the sarcoplasmic reticulum into the cytoplasm of the muscle cell. (Statement 2 ruled out) Binding of calcium ions to troponin C Calcium ions bind to troponin C on the thin filaments, causing a conformational change in the troponin complex. Cross-bridge formation between myosin and actin The conformational change in the troponin complex moves tropomyosin away from the myosin-binding sites on actin, allowing the myosin heads (with ADP and Pi bound) to attach to the exposed binding sites on actin. Power stroke, moving the myosin head from 90 degrees to 45 degrees The myosin head pivots from a 90-degree angle to a 45-degree angle, pulling the actin filament toward the center of the sarcomere. ADP and Pi are released during this movement. Detachment of the myosin head from actin A new ATP molecule binds to the myosin head, causing it to detach from the actin filament. Hydrolysis of ATP to ADP and Pi, re-cocking the myosin head The ATP is hydrolyzed to ADP and Pi, providing energy to re-cock the myosin head back to the 90-degree position, ready for another cycle of contraction.

      },
      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "inverse myotatic reflex/autogenic inhibition, is mediated by the Golgi tendon organs (GTOs). Golgi tendon organs are specialized sensory receptors located in the tendons near the junction of muscles and tendons. When the muscle contracts and applies tension to the tendon, the GTOs are activated. They sense changes in tension and send inhibitory signals to the spinal cord, which in turn inhibits the motor neurons innervating the muscle. This reflex helps prevent excessive tension and potential damage to the muscle and tendon by inhibiting further contraction. Main outcome: Relaxation of the muscle in response to a strong stretch. Reflex arc Receptor Golgi Tendon Organs (GTOs). Location of Receptors Found at the junction of muscles and tendons. Afferent Fiber Type Ib afferent fibers. Stimulus Increased tension within the muscle-tendon unit. Response Inhibition of the alpha motor neurons leading to muscle relaxation. Function Prevents damage to muscles and tendons from excessive force or tension. Muscle spindle (Option B): The muscle spindle is responsible for the stretch reflex, also known as the myotatic reflex, which detects changes in muscle length and initiates a reflex contraction of the muscle. Unmyelinated C fibres (Option C): They are associated with pain perception and are not specifically involved in the inverse stretch reflex. Dorsal Column (Option D): It refers to a pathway in the spinal cord involved in transmitting sensory information related to touch, proprioception, and vibration. It is not directly involved in mediating the inverse stretch reflex. Reference: G.K Pal - Comprehensive textbook of medical physiology, 1st Edition- Page 237, 238, 1055, 1057, 1071",

        "D": "Dissociation of ADP and Pi"
      },
      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "actin filaments occurs when ATP binds to the myosin head. After the power stroke (when myosin pulls on actin), ADP and inorganic phosphate (Pi) are still bound to the myosin head. When ATP binds to the myosin head, it causes the myosin head to detach from actin. This detachment allows the muscle to relax and prepares the myosin head for the next contraction cycle. Stimulus (e.g., hormones, neurotransmitters, or stretch) I Calcium channels open, allowing Ca² I to enter the cell from the extracellular fluid. I Formation of Calcium-calmodulin complex (Intracellular Ca² I binds to calmodulin) I The Ca² I -calmodulin complex activates myosin light chain kinase (MLCK) I MLCK phosphorylates the light chains of myosin I Phosphorylated myosin interacts with actin filaments. I The interaction between myosin and actin causes contraction Smooth muscle can maintain contraction with less energy expenditure than skeletal muscle (Latch-bridge mechanism). Relaxation: Occurs when Ca² I is pumped out of the cell or back into the sarcoplasmic reticulum, and myosin is dephosphorylated. Cessation of calcium release from the sarcoplasm (Option B) : Calcium ions are essential for muscle contraction. They bind to troponin, causing a conformational change that exposes myosin-binding sites on actin. In the absence of calcium, the cross-bridge cycle halts, preventing the power stroke. Conformational change in Troponin T (Option C) : Troponin T helps regulate tropomyosin's position on actin, which controls the binding of myosin to actin, facilitating muscle contraction. Dissociation of ADP and Pi (Option D) : The dissociation of ADP and inorganic phosphate (Pi) from myosin triggers the power stroke, driving muscle contraction.

      },
      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: C) Becomes more positive Explanation: In hyperkalemia, where serum potassium levels are higher than normal (as in this patient with muscle injury), the concentration gradient of potassium ions across the cell membrane changes. RMP in hyperkalemia, hypokalemia and hypocalcemia Condition Hyperkalemia Hypokalemia RMP Depolarized (Decreased RMP) Hyperpolarized (Increased RMP) Explanation Increased extracellular potassium reduces the gradient for potassium to exit the cell, causing depolarization. The resting membrane potential becomes less negative than the typical -70 mV. (Option C) (Options A & D ruled out) In hypokalemia, cells lose more potassium ions due to leaky channels. The loss of positive charge increases the negative charge within the cell, causing hyperpolarization. (Option B ruled out) Effect on Neuron Excitability Increased excitability can lead to spontaneous firing and even cell death. Persistent depolarization inactivates voltage-gated sodium channels, preventing action potential generation. Decreased excitability occurs as the membrane potential is further from the threshold for action potential. Hypokalemia also inhibits the Na-K-ATPase pump. Hypocalcemia: When blood calcium is normal or high, calcium remains bound to the extracellular mouth of voltage-gated Na I channels, stabilizing them. Low blood Ca 2+ (hypocalcemia) causes calcium to detach from the channel, leading to easier sodium entry. This detachment increases Na I channel sensitivity, enhancing excitability and action potential generation. Calcium and magnesium act as membrane stabilizers. Hyperkalemia can eventually lead to increased activity of the Na + /K + -ATPase pump as a compensatory mechanism; this is not a direct or immediate effect on the RMP.",

      "correct_answer": "D",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: D) Point B to D is a refractory period Explanation: The given graph represents an action potential curve of a nerve. Point B to D represents the refractory period, a phase during which a second action potential is impossible or difficult to trigger. This period includes the absolute refractory period (impossible to trigger a second action potential) and the relative refractory period (a second action potential can be triggered but requires a stronger stimulus).

Depolarization at one site causes local current flow that triggers action potentials in adjacent regions. All-or-Nothing Principle : An action potential occurs only if the threshold is reached, maintaining consistent magnitude regardless of stimulus strength. Refractory Periods: (Option D) Absolute Refractory Period : Na + channels are inactivated, preventing another action potential. Relative Refractory Period : Requires a stronger stimulus to trigger another action potential due to partial repolarization. Myelination and Saltatory Conduction: Myelin Sheath insulates nerve fibers, formed by Schwann cells. Action potentials \"jump\" between nodes of Ranvier, speeding up transmission and saving energy. Energy Dependence: Na I -K I Pump restores ionic gradients after an action potential, consuming ATP. Factors Influencing Excitability: Calcium Ions (Ca² I ) : Low extracellular Ca² I increases excitability by lowering the activation threshold for Na I channels; high Ca² I decreases excitability.

A length decrease (Option B) is incorrect because the A band remains constant (myosin filament length does not change). M length increase and I decrease (Option D) is incorrect because while I band decreases , the M line does not change in length .

      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: B) Myasthenia gravis Explanation: Myasthenia gravis is an autoimmune disorder that leads to weakness of the voluntary muscles, particularly affecting the eyes and face. The condition often worsens with activity and improves with rest. Symptoms commonly include ptosis, diplopia (double vision), and generalized muscle weakness. Disorders related to Neuromuscular junction: Feature Myasthenia Gravis Lambert-Eaton Myasthenic Syndrome (LEMS) Primary autoantibody target Acetylcholine receptors Voltage-gated calcium channels Pathophysiology Reduced postsynaptic acetylcholine receptors Decreased presynaptic acetylcholine release Fatigue pattern Worsens with activity Improves with brief exercise. (Option A) Reflexes Normal or mildly reduced Reduced or absent may improve after exercise. Repetitive nerve stimulation Decremental response. Incremental response. Response to edrophonium Improves symptoms. Little to no improvement. Botulism Toxicity (Option C): is caused by botulinum toxin, which inhibits acetylcholine release at the neuromuscular junction. It results in muscle weakness, but symptoms typically include descending paralysis and can affect multiple muscle groups. While ptosis may occur, botulism generally presents with more widespread weakness and not specifically with worsening symptoms throughout the day. Tetanus Toxicity (Option D): Tetanus is caused by the toxin of Clostridium tetani, leading to severe muscle spasms and rigidity. Symptoms often include lockjaw, muscle stiffness, and generalized spasms, rather than ptosis or symptoms that worsen with the day.

When an action potential travels along the T-tubule, DHPR channels open in response to voltage changes, allowing calcium ions to enter the sarcoplasm. Sarcotubular System: The Sarcotubular system is composed of the L tubule and T tubule. The T-tubule contains an L-type voltage-gated Calcium channel, known as the DHPR (dihydropyridine receptor channel). The L-tubule contains a calcium channel known as RyR ryanodine receptor channel (Option D) SERCA pump (Option A): Sarcoplasmic/Endoplasmic Reticulum Calcium ATPase is situated on the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) membrane in muscle cells, moves calcium ions (Ca2+) from the cell's cytoplasm into the SR lumen, against their concentration gradient.

      "explanation": "Correct Answer: B) Stretch receptor in the muscle belly Explanation: The muscle spindle is a specialized sensory receptor located within the muscle belly. It detects changes in muscle length (stretch) and velocity to asses the joint's position. Muscle spindle receptor Muscle spindles are sensory receptors located within the bulk of skeletal muscles, specifically within the muscle belly. They are spindle-shaped and play a crucial role in detecting changes in muscle length and velocity, which helps in sensing the position of joints. Structure of muscle spindles: Intrafusal fibers: These are the specialized muscle fibers that make up the muscle spindle. Unlike typical muscle fibers, they are non-contractile in the central region and are surrounded by a capsule. Intrafusal fibers are red due to their high mitochondrial content. Extrafusal fibers: Surrounding the muscle spindles, these are the standard contractile fibers of the skeletal muscle. They are white and responsible for generating force and movement. Function: Length detection: Muscle spindles detect changes in muscle length. When a muscle is stretched, the muscle spindle is also stretched, which activates the sensory nerve endings within the spindle. Velocity detection: The spindles can also detect the rate of change of muscle length (velocity of stretch), providing important information for maintaining posture and coordinating movements. Stretch receptor on the tendon (Option A): The Golgi tendon organ, not a muscle spindle, is located in the tendon and detects changes in muscle tension rather than length. I Golgi tendon organ (Option C): As mentioned, this organ detects muscle tension and not length. I Mechanoreceptor in the joint capsule (Option D): These receptors detect changes in joint position and pressure but do not directly monitor muscle length during contraction.

This activation is crucial for muscle contraction. Mechanism of smooth muscle contraction: Smooth muscle can maintain contraction with less energy expenditure than skeletal muscle (Latch-bridge mechanism). Relaxation: Occurs when Ca² I is pumped out of the cell or back into the sarcoplasmic reticulum, and myosin is dephosphorylated. Troponin (Option B): is a calcium-binding protein found in skeletal muscle, not smooth muscle. In skeletal muscle, calcium binds to troponin to initiate contraction.

Resting Membrane Potential (Point A on graph): At rest, the neuron's membrane potential is around -70 mV. K+ permeability is higher than Na+ permeability due to the presence of K+ leak channels. However, the overall permeability to both ions is relatively low. Depolarization Phase (Between Points A and C): (Options A and D ruled out) Voltage-gated Na+ channels open faster than K+ channels. Rapid influx of Na+ ions, causing a rapid rise in membrane potential, causing a steep slope. Peak of Action Potential (Point C): Na+ permeability is at its maximum. K+ channels are also opening at this stage but have not reached their peak. Early Repolarization Phase (Point D): (Option C) Voltage-gated K+ channels are fully open, resulting in the highest permeability. K+ moves exits the cell. Na+ channels are rapidly inactivated during this phase. Late Repolarization and After-hyperpolarization (Points E and F): (Option C) K+ permeability starts to decline as the membrane potential moves towards its resting state.

      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "assertion states that the resting membrane potential (RMP) depends on proteins and phosphate ions. This is true because the RMP is primarily maintained by the selective permeability of the cell membrane to different ions, such as potassium (K + ), sodium (Na + ), chloride (Cl - ), and negatively charged proteins. These ions contribute to the electrical charge across the membrane and affect the RMP. The Nernst equation calculates the Nernst potential (EMF) for a single, univalent ion (an ion with a +1 or -1 charge) at normal body temperature (37°C) The Nernst potential magnitude depends on the ion concentration ratio across the membrane; larger differences result in higher potentials. The diffusion potential contributes to the overall electrical potential difference across the membrane, including the RMP. Therefore, both the assertion and the reason are true, but the reason does not explain the assertion. Reference: Guyton and Hall Textbook of Medical Physiology, 14th edition, Pg 63-67",

      "explanation": "of ATP is covered by anaerobic glycolysis due to reduced oxygen availability. Phosphocreatine (anaerobic glycolysis) is a high-energy phosphate compound that is stored in skeletal muscles. During high-intensity activities like sprinting, it can rapidly donate a phosphate group to ADP (adenosine diphosphate), regenerating ATP (adenosine triphosphate). This provides a quick source of energy without the need for oxygen or extensive metabolic pathways. Incorrect Options: Option B - Aerobic glycolysis: Aerobic glycolysis refers to the breakdown of glucose in the presence of oxygen to produce ATP. This process occurs in the cytoplasm of cells and involves a series of enzymatic reactions. It is an important energy pathway during prolonged endurance activities when oxygen is readily available. Option C and D: Fatty acids and tryglycerides are the primary fuel source for aerobic metabolism. During low-intensity and long-duration activities, such as distance running, the body relies on the oxidation of fatty acids to generate ATP. Reference: Prepladder Notes",
