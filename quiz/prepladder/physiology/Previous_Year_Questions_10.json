      },
      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: C) Hemodilution Explanation: Decompression sickness (DCS) is caused by nitrogen bubble formation due to rapid ascent from high-pressure environments. Vision loss can occur due to air embolism affecting the retinal circulation . Hearing loss can result from inner ear barotrauma or vestibulocochlear involvement . Coagulopathy occurs due to vascular injury and activation of coagulation pathways . Hemodilution is not seen in DCS because the condition primarily leads to dehydration , not plasma volume expansion. Pathophysiology of Decompression Sickness System Affected Manifestations Neurological Vision loss, confusion, vertigo, paralysis Otorhinolaryngologic Hearing loss, tinnitus, dizziness Cardiovascular Coagulopathy, gas embolism, shock Pulmonary Dyspnea, chest pain (\"chokes\") Vision loss (Option A): Incorrect because air embolism can cause retinal artery occlusion . Hearing loss (Option B): Incorrect because inner ear barotrauma and nitrogen bubbles can affect hearing . Coagulopathy (Option D): Incorrect because bubble-induced endothelial damage triggers clotting abnormalities .
