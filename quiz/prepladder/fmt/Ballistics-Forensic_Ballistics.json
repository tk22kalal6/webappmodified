Billiard ball effect vs Balling or welding Billiard ball effect (Billiard Ball Ricochet Effect) (Option A) Balling or welding (Option B) When shotgun pellets enter tissue, the first pellets slow down and are struck from behind by subsequent pellets, causing them to scatter through the tissue like a cluster of billiard balls hit by the cue ball. In distant shots, the pellets can merge into a compact mass, causing the lead shots to stick together and create a larger entry wound while exhibiting some dispersion. It occurs due to: Faulty manufacture (too much powder, poor pressure of wads,paraffin into cartridge case) Old ammunition Very high dispersion (due to resistance) Less dispersion Low range (near shot resembles distant range) High range (wound mimics intermediate shot) Rayalseena phenomenon (Option C) : To disguise a murder as a firearm injury, a bullet is placed in an individual who was initially killed by a stab wound, misleading the investigating agency.

      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: B) Wads are used in all types of cartridges Explanation: Wads are specifically used only in smooth-bore shotgun cartridges , not rifle cartridges. Cartridge: A cartridge is a complete unit of ammunition consisting of the following components: Cartridge case : Contains the percussion cap with primer. Propellant charge : Typically gunpowder. Projectile : This can be bullets or pellets. Cartridge of Rifle Cartridge of Shotgun Contains a primer on the base and a cartridge case filled with gunpowder. Features a single projectile (bullet). Does not include a wad (Option B) Contains lead shots (Option D) / Pellets (Multiple Projectiles) (Option A) Wads : Used only in smoothbore weapons (Shotguns). Advantages of Wads: Facilitates optimal pressure. Prevents gas escape from the bore. Aids in lubrication. Stops gas from escaping at the breech end. Maintains separation between the propellant and projectiles. Bullet: A projectile that exits the muzzle of a rifled firearm upon discharge. Material : Typically made from soft metal, primarily lead (Option D) , often with added antimony and/or tin for increased hardness. Shape: Round nose soft bullet : Commonly used in revolvers and pistols. Rifle bullets : Generally elongated with a pointed tip. (Option C) Types: Lead bullets : Made entirely of lead, offering expansion upon impact. Metal-Jacketed Bullets : A lead core encased in a metal jacket (usually copper) enhances accuracy and reduces barrel fouling. They also prevent deformation from dirt and impacts and reduce fragmentation to protect the firearm from damage.",

      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: C) Limits spread of pellets Explanation: Limiting the spread of pellets is a characteristic more associated with smooth-bore shotguns (not rifled firearms), achieved through a process known as Choking. Choking Rifling ( Rifled Firearms) Definition: Choking refers to the constriction at the muzzle end of a shotgun barrel. Types: Cylinder Bore: The barrel has a uniform diameter throughout. Choke Bore: The muzzle is slightly constricted. Degrees of Choke : Full, modified, improved cylinder, and cylinder. Advantages of Choking: Reduces shot spread. Increases explosive force. Enhances velocity and range. Dispersion: A fully choked barrel produces shot dispersion that is half that of a cylinder bore. As the bullet travels through the bore, it engages with the rifling, imparting a spin that enhances accuracy and stability. Each weapon leaves a unique marking on the bullet, aiding forensic identification. Advantages of Rifling: Gyroscopic Stability Increased Accuracy (Option A) : Increased Range (stability and spin) (Option B) Reduced Wobbling (Option D) (tumbling end-over-end during flight) Greater Penetration Power",

      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: A) Distance between two opposite lands Explanation: In forensic ballistics, \"caliber\" refers to the diameter of a rifled firearm's barrel, specifically measured between opposing lands. This measurement, typically expressed in inches or millimetres, is crucial for linking a bullet to a specific firearm. Rifled Firearms: Rifled firearms have a bore characterised by a series of grooves that spiral along the barrel's length. These grooves (Option B) , known as \"rifling,\" alternate with raised areas called \"lands.\" The caliber is determined by measuring the distance between these lands. The direction of rifling can be either right (clockwise) or left (counter-clockwise), with most handguns featuring a right-hand twist. As the bullet travels through the barrel, it engages with the lands and grooves, imparting a spin that stabilises its flight and leaves distinctive markings on the bullet, which serve as identifiers for the firearm. Muzzle constriction controlling shot spread (Option C) : This refers to the Choke , which narrows the barrel's end to control the dispersion of shot pellets as they exit, influencing the effectiveness of the shotgun at different ranges. Measurement of shotgun bore diameter (Option D) : This describes the Gauge , indicating the size of the shotgun bore, which is determined by the number of lead balls c orresponding to the diameter of shotgun bo re that can be made from one pound of lead.",
