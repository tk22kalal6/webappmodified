      "question": "When an individual commences employment with a second employer, the new employer assumes responsibility for the individual's actions, under which doctrine?",
      "options": {
        "A": "Vicarious liability",
        "B": "Doctrine of negligent choice",
        "C": "Contributory negligence",
        "D": "Borrowed servant doctrine"
      },
      "correct_answer": "D",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: D) Borrowed servant doctrine Explanation: The Borrowed Servant Doctrine refers to a situation where an employee is temporarily transferred from one employer to work under the direction and control of another employer. In this case, the new employer assumes responsibility for the employee’s actions while they are under their supervision. Essentially, even though the employee remains on the payroll of the original employer, the new employer has control over the employee’s work and, therefore, is liable for the employee's actions while they are working for them. Vicarious Liability/ Respondeat Superior Employers are liable for the negligent acts of their employees under certain conditions. Also called the Master-Servant rule. Conditions : Employer-employee relationship. Conduct occurs within the scope of employment. Incident occurs while on the job. Principal doctors can be held responsible for the negligence of their assistants. Temporary Relationships : Surgeons assisting each other may create an employer-employee relationship thus being liable for each other's actions. Borrowed Servant Doctrine : An employee can serve multiple employers (e.g., a nurse assisting a surgeon is a \"borrowed servant\" during surgery). Negligence occurring due to borrowing of temporary staff from another department. Hospital Liability : Hospitals are liable for the acts of employees under their supervision, but not for senior staff if due care in hiring is proven. Direct Supervision : Physicians are responsible for the acts of interns and residents they supervise. Defense Against Liability: Employers can avoid liability by proving the employee was not negligent or was acting outside the scope of employment. Incorrect Options: Vicarious liability (Option A) : While this doctrine does involve holding an employer responsible for the actions of an employee, it generally refers to the principal employer 's responsibility for their own employees' actions, rather than the responsibility when an employee is temporarily working for another employer. Doctrine of negligent choice (Option B) : This refers to the liability of an employer for hiring an individual who is unfit or negligent in their duties, leading to harm or injury. It does not relate to the responsibility of the new employer for the employee's actions once employed. Contributory negligence (Option C) : This is a defense in tort law where the injured party’s own negligence contributes to their injury. It does not pertain to the responsibility of an employer for an employee’s actions. Reference: Review of Forensic Medicine and Toxicology, Gautam Biswas, 3rd Edition, Page 21",

      "question": "Which of the following defines rape?",
      "options": {
        "A": "375 IPC",
        "B": "376 IPC",
        "C": "377 IPC",
        "D": "498 (A) IPC"
      },
      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: A) 375 IPC Explanation: Rape definition and conditions Section 375 IPC (BNS 63) defines rape: a) Penetrates his penis, to any extent, into the vagina, mouth, urethra or anus of a woman or makes her to do so with him or any other person; or b) Inserts, to any extent, any object or a part of the body, not being the penis, into the vagina, the urethra or anus of a woman or makes her to do so with him or any other person; or c) Manipulates any part of the body of a woman so as to cause penetration into the vagina, urethra, anus or any part of body of such woman or makes her to do so with him or any other person; or d) Applies his mouth to the vagina, anus, urethra of a woman or makes her to do so with him or any other person, under the circumstances falling under any of the following seven descriptions: Against her will Without her consent With her consent, only because she or someone she cares about is threatened with harm or death. With her consent, she mistakenly believes the man is her lawful husband when the man knows that he is not her husband. With her consent, when, at the time of giving such consent, she cannot understand the nature or consequences due to intoxication, mental incapacity, or being drugged. With or without her consent, when she is under eighteen years of age. When she is unable to communicate consent. Exceptions: A medical procedure or intervention shall not constitute rape. Sexual intercourse or sexual acts by a man with his wife, the wife not being under eighteen years of age, is not rape. Note: Even if a girl gives consent below 18 years, it is known as statutory rape. Incorrect Options: 376 IPC (Option B) prescribes the punishment for rape. It outlines the penalties for committing rape, including rigorous imprisonment and fines, with more severe punishments for aggravated circumstances. 377 IPC (Option C) pertains to unnatural offenses, criminalizing sexual acts “against the order of nature” (a historically controversial provision, partially decriminalized for consensual same-sex relations in 2018). 498(A) IPC (Option D) addresses cruelty by husband or relatives of the husband towards a woman. This includes harassment, physical abuse, and mental torture, often related to dowry demands.
