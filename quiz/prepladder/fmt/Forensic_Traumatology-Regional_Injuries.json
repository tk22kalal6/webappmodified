      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "Correct answer: A) Temporal bone Explanation: The temporal bone is the most commonly fractured in basilar skull fractures. These fractures can lead to serious complications, including damage to cranial nerves VII (facial nerve) and VIII (vestibulocochlear nerve) and the carotid artery, as well as potential cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) leaks. Thickness of skull bones Male Female Frontal 7.8 mm 8.6 mm Parietal 9.6 mm 10.1 mm Occipital 10.1 mm 10 mm Temporal 6 mm 6 mm Temporal bone fracture Longitudinal Temporal Bone Fracture Transverse Temporal Bone Fracture The most common type (70-90% of temporal bone fractures). Runs parallel to the long axis of the petrous temporal bone. Otic Capsule is spared. Conductive hearing loss due to ossicle involvement and tympanic membrane involvement. Facial nerve involvement occurs in about 25% of cases. Less common (10-30% of temporal bone fractures). Extends perpendicular to the petrous temporal bone's long axis. Otic Capsule is involved, leading to sensorineural hearing loss. Ossicles and tympanic membranes are generally unaffected. Higher incidence of facial nerve involvement. Occipital bone ( Option B ), Sphenoid bone ( Option C ), Frontal bone ( Option D ): While the occipital, sphenoid, and frontal bones can be involved in basilar skull fractures, they are not as commonly fractured as the temporal bone. Their occurrences are significantly less frequent compared to fractures of the temporal bone.

      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Correct answer: B) A child with increased intracranial pressure Explanation: Fissured Fracture (Linear Fracture) Diastatic Fracture (Sutural Fracture) The most common skull fracture accounts for about 70% of cases. Linear cracks may involve the vertex or skull base. It can affect the full thickness of the bone or just the inner/outer layers. The fracture line is irregular and fine, sometimes hard to detect on X-rays. It runs parallel to the compressive force. No depression of bone fragments. Involves the separation of cranial sutures. More common in children. Often occurs with other skull fractures, especially fissured fractures. Commonly seen at the sagittal suture. Causes: Impact against broad surfaces (e.g., falls or road traffic accidents). (Option A ruled out) Falls on feet or buttocks, transmitting force upwards. (Option D ruled out) Causes: Blunt trauma to the head. Increased intracranial pressure leads to suture separation. (Option B) Narrow fissure skull fracture A teenager experiencing a sports-related injury (Option C): Sports-related injuries typically do not involve sutural separation, which is specific to diastatic fractures.",

Caused by blows from heavy objects with a small surface (e.g., hammers, bricks). (Option A ruled out) The shape of the depressed area may resemble the object that caused the injury. Variants: Elevated Fracture : One end of the fractured fragment is raised above the skull, while the other is pushed inward. Caused by sharp objects like an axe. (Option D ruled out) Pond Fracture : Seen in infants, this smooth depression occurs without a fracture line, resembling a dent in a ping-pong ball. Caused by obstetrics forceps blade. Involves multiple intersecting fracture lines, breaking the bone into several fragments. Caused by high-impact trauma (e.g., vehicular accidents, crushing injuries). (Option C ruled",

      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Correct answer: C) Teardrop sign Explanation: Blowout fracture is a fracture of the bony orbit (eye socket) resulting from blunt trauma to the eye. It causes fractures to the medial wall and floor of the orbit. The teardrop sign is a significant radiographic finding in blowout fractures , indicating the herniation of orbital soft tissues, such as fat and muscles, into the maxillary sinus. This often leads to pain, restricted eye movements and diplopia. Blowout fracture of right orbit showing Teardrop sign Spider web-like pattern on X-ray (Option A): The spider web-like pattern on an X-ray is characteristic of comminuted fractures , which involve multiple fracture lines creating a fragmented appearance. Ping-pong ball dent appearance (Option B): The ping-pong ball dent appearance is associated with pond fractures, which occur in infants and young children. This type of fracture is characterised by a smooth, concave indentation in the skull without a distinct fracture line. Circular crack around the skull base (Option D): A circular crack around the skull base is indicative of a ring fracture, which encircles the foramen magnum and is associated with severe trauma.",

      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "impact. Correct Answer: C) Contrecoup injuries primarily affect the areas directly beneath the point of impact. Explanation: Coup injuries primarily affect the areas directly beneath the point of impact, while contrecoup injuries affect the side opposite the impact. Coup vs. Contrecoup Injuries Features Coup Contrecoup Definition Brain injury directly beneath the point of impact. Brain injury on the side opposite the impact. Mechanism Caused by direct impact force. Occurs when a moving head is suddenly decelerated by hitting a firm surface eg. striking the head on the ground after a fall during RTAs. (Option B ruled out) Occurrence More common when a moving object strikes the head. Common in falls or blows to a stationary head. Common scenarios Common in moving head striking an object, e.g., hitting a car dashboard in an accident. Seen in falls, where the head hits the ground or an unyielding surface, causing injury on the opposite side of the impact. Organs involved It can be seen in the brain, heart, spleen and lungs. (More commonly in the brain) Theories of Contrecoup Injuries: Shear Strain Theory (Holbourn): Brain particles are pulled apart due to rotational forces. (Option D ruled out) Vacuum Theory: A vacuum or cavity forms in the cranial cavity, exerting suction on the brain opposite the point of impact, causing damage. Deceleration Theory: Sudden arrest of the head causes the brain to strike the skull at the opposite pole of impact. Common scenarios: Occipital impact: Produces frontal contrecoup injury due to brain displacement against the frontal lobes. (Option A ruled out) Temporal or parietal impact: Results in contralateral contrecoup injury on the opposite side of the brain. Top of the head impact: Can cause ventral surface contusion of the cerebral hemisphere. Frontal region impact: May not produce occipital contrecoup injury due to the smooth internal surface of the posterior cranial fossa Reference: The Essentials of Forensic Medicine, KS Narayan Reddy, 35th Edition, Page 192, 193 Organs affected",

        "D": "The middle meningeal artery is located between the dura mater and the arachnoid mater."
      },
      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: C) The subarachnoid space contains arteries of the circle of Willis Explanation: The subarachnoid space is situated between the arachnoid mater and pia mater and contains major arteries, including those of the circle of Willis. This space is usually filled with clear, colourless cerebrospinal fluid. Head trauma or rupture of an intracranial aneurysm causes a subarachnoid haemorrhage (bleeding in the subarachnoid space). The most common specific locations of intracranial aneurysms are at the middle cerebral artery bifurcation and along the anterior communicating artery. Meningeal layers Intracranial haemorrhages The first layer is the skull vault (cranium), followed by the dura mater, arachnoid mater, pia mater, and brain tissue (cerebrum). The space between the skull and dura contains the middle meningeal artery. The middle meningeal artery is most prominent at the pterion, the point where the frontal, parietal, sphenoid, and temporal bones meet. Space Location Blood vessel involved Epidural Space Between the skull vault and dura mater. The collection of blood here leads to epidural hematoma. Middle meningeal artery (Option D ruled out) Subdural Space Between the arachnoid and dura mater. The collection of blood here leads to subdural hematoma.

      "explanation": "Correct Answer: C) Dementia pugilistica Explanation: The patient’s history of repeated head trauma (boxing), along with symptoms like incoordination, memory loss, personality changes, dysarthria and broad-based gait, is characteristic of punch-drunk syndrome (dementia pugilistica) . Punch-Drunk Syndrome: Also known as dementia pugilistica or boxer's encephalopathy , it results from repeated cerebral concussions, typically in boxers. Signs and Symptoms: Deterioration of speed and reflexes Incoordination Personality changes (social instability, paranoia, delusions) Memory loss (progressing to dementia) Parkinsonian signs : Ataxia or intention tremors Shuffling, broad-based gait Dysarthria (difficulty speaking) Autopsy findings: Chronic subdural haematoma (SDH) Attenuation of the corpus callosum Diffuse axonal injury (DAI) Cortical atrophy Parkinson's disease (Option A) : Although Parkinson's disease shares some features like tremors and gait disturbances, this patient has a history of boxing and repeated head trauma, which makes punch-drunk syndrome more likely. Alzheimer's disease (Option B) is primarily associated with memory loss and cognitive decline but the history of boxing and gait disturbances differentiate punch drunk syndrome from it. Multiple sclerosis (Option D) can cause motor and cognitive symptoms but is less likely given the patient's history and specific symptoms linked to repeated head trauma.
