      "explanation": "Correct answer: B) Hypoxemia Explanation: Morphine is an alkaloid found in opium Morphine causes hypoxemia Findings in Morphine poisoning: Hypoxia and respiratory acidosis is seen due to respiratory depression by acting on mu opiate receptors and in the medulla via mu and delta receptors. Hyperkalaemia occur following an overdose,especially in the presence of rhabdomyolysis and acute renal failure, not hypokalemia. Opioid Receptor Activation: Morphine binds to opioid receptors, particularly the mu-opioid receptors, which can influence various hormonal systems. This activation can lead to altered signaling pathways that may reduce gluconeogenic enzyme activity in the liver and can lead to hypoglycemia.

      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: B) Sea snake Explanation: Sea snake venom is highly myotoxic, causing significant muscle damage, which can lead to rhabdomyolysis and acute kidney injury. Clinical features of myotoxic snake venom: Common in Sea Snakes: Myotoxic venoms are characteristic of particularly sea snakes. Muscle necrosis (First finding): Myotoxic venoms cause direct damage to muscle fibers (skeletal muscle), leading to muscle cell death (necrosis). Rhabdomyolysis : Breakdown of muscle tissue results in the release of muscle contents, such as myoglobin, into the bloodstream. Elevated Creatine Kinase (CK): A marker of muscle damage, CK levels are significantly elevated in cases of myotoxic envenomation. Myoglobinuria : The release of myoglobin can overwhelm the kidneys, leading to myoglobin in urine, which can cause acute kidney injury. Muscle Weakness : Progressive muscle pain and weakness are common symptoms due to muscle breakdown. Tests for neurotoxic and vasculotoxic snake bite Neurotoxic Test Vasculotoxic Test Single Breath Count Test Count numbers in a single breath. Repeat the counting test every 15 minutes. If it decreases, it indicates ongoing respiratory failure. Whole Blood Clotting Test (WBCT) Put whole blood in a clean and dry test tube. Wait for 20 minutes and analyse the blood in the test tube. After 20 minutes if blood clots: No snake bite or not vasculotoxic venom. After 20 minutes if blood does not clot: Suggests Viper snake poisoning. King cobra (Option A): Primarily neurotoxic. Russell’s Viper (Option C): Primarily vasculotoxic. Banded krait (Option D): Primarily neurotoxic.",

      "question": "A forensic pathologist is conducting an autopsy on a 38-year-old male who died after an accidental exposure to hydrofluoric acid (HF) at an industrial plant. Which of the following postmortem findings is most characteristic of HF poisoning?",
      "options": {
        "A": "Cherry-red discoloration of the blood",
        "B": "Black tarry stool",
        "C": "Severe hypocalcemia and calcium deposits in tissues",
        "D": "Widespread gastric mucosal erosion"
      },
      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: C) Severe hypocalcemia and calcium deposits in tissues Explanation: Hydrofluoric acid binds with calcium in the body, causing hypocalcemia and leading to the precipitation of calcium salts in tissues. This can be a characteristic finding in both clinical and postmortem evaluations of HF poisoning cases. Hydrofluoric Acid (HF) Chemical Properties Aqueous solution of hydrogen fluoride (HF) in concentrations from 0.5% (domestic) to 100% (industrial). Potent dehydrating agent; causes chemical burns. Sources and Uses Found in rust removers, detergents, cleaning agents. Used in glass etching, metal processing, fluorine compound production. Mechanism of Toxicity Corrosive: Hydrogen ions cause immediate tissue damage by coagulative necrosis. Fluoride ion toxicity: Fluoride ions penetrate tissues, leading to liquefactive necrosis and systemic toxicity. Routes of Exposure Dermal contact: Common, causes severe burns. Inhalation: Leads to respiratory distress. Ingestion: Causes gastrointestinal burns. Symptoms Dermal burns: Severe pain, redness, necrosis (may be delayed). Ocular injury: Conjunctivitis, corneal erosion, possible vision loss. Respiratory issues: Coughing, dyspnea, pulmonary edema (from inhalation). Gastrointestinal distress: Nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain (from ingestion). Neuromuscular: Confusion, seizures due to electrolyte imbalances (hypocalcemia, hyperkalemia). Autopsy Findings Severe burns in esophageal and gastric mucosa. Hyperemic lesions in the renal tubular system. Necrotic lesions in cardiac muscle. Management Promptly rinse the area with water or saline for at least 30 minutes. Apply 2.5% calcium gluconate gel every 10-15 minutes until pain subsides. Severe cases may require intravenous calcium gluconate, airway support, and monitoring of electrolytes in an ICU setting. Cherry-red discoloration of the blood (Option A): This is typically associated with carbon monoxide poisoning, not HF poisoning. Black tarry stool (melena) (Option B) : Melena is associated with upper gastrointestinal bleeding, which is unrelated to HF poisoning. Widespread gastric mucosal erosion (Option D): This finding is more typical of ingestion of strong acids or corrosives but is not specific to HF poisoning.

        "A": "Oxalic acid poisoning",
        "B": "Sulfuricacid poisoning",
        "C": "Carbolicacid poisoning",
        "D": "Nitricacid poisoning"
      },
      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: C) Carbolic acid poisoning Explanation : Carbolic acid (phenol) poisoning presents with Gray/brown corrosions on mouth, esophageal burns, a strong antiseptic odor, CNS depression, hypotension and renal failure due to its toxic effects on the central nervous system, cardiovascular system and kidneys. Phenol Poisoning (Carbolism) Physical Properties Colorless, crystalline, turns pink on air exposure; slightly acidic, forms phenolate ion (C6H5O I ). Uses Antiseptic/disinfectant; Lysol (50% cresol), Dettol (chlorinated phenol with turpineol). Fatal Dose 1-2 g phenol or 25-50 ml of household phenol. Fatal Period 3-4 hours. Tissue Discoloration Can lead to ochronosis (bluish-black discoloration in tissues like ears and sclera). Signs and symptoms Local Effects: Tingling → numbness → coagulation necrosis → painless white eschar, which turns brown and sloughs off. Gastrointestinal: Initial burning/tingling, later anesthesia; diarrhea and abdominal pain, vomiting rare. Respiratory: Phenol odor on breath, laryngeal/pulmonary edema, stertorous breathing, cyanosis. Metabolized by kidneys into hydroquinone/pyrocatechol; causes carboluria ( dark green urine ). Cardiovascular (CVS): Rapid, feeble, irregular pulse; cold, clammy skin; collapse, unconsciousness, coma. Muscular: Muscle spasms, convulsions CNS: Headache, giddiness, tinnitus, contracted pupils. Renal: Dark smoky green color of urine. Postmortem Findings External: Gray/brown corrosions on mouth, body, hands; phenolic odor, delayed putrefaction. Internal: Corroded GIT mucosa, leathery stomach, pulmonary edema, hemorrhagic nephritis. Medico-legal Aspects Used in suicides, accidental poisoning, rare for homicides (strong odor/taste), abortifacient. Oxalic acid poisoning (Option A) : Oxalic acid causes renal damage, resulting in swollen, congested kidneys with tubular necrosis, along with gelatinous brown content in the stomach. It lacks the characteristic antiseptic odor associated with carbolic acid. Sulfuric acid poisoning (Option B): Produces black burns, but there is no antiseptic odor, and sulfuric acid is more likely to cause severe external chemical burns rather than the systemic effects seen here. Nitric acid poisoning (Option D): Causes yellow burns and severe systemic toxicity, but lacks the distinctive odor.

        "A": "Bright red lividity",
        "B": "Blackish staining and necrosis of the lips and mouth",
        "C": "Greenish discoloration of the skin",
        "D": "Yellowish staining and necrosis of the lips and mouth"
      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: B) Blackish staining and necrosis of the lips and mouth Explanation : Sulfuric acid is highly corrosive and can cause characteristic blackish burns, particularly on the mucosal surfaces, such as the lips and mouth along with chalky white, brittle teeth. This is a key forensic finding in sulfuric acid ingestion cases. Sulfuric Acid (H I SO I ) Physical Properties: Colorless, odorless, with a burning taste; oily and non-fuming. Fatal Dose: 5–10 ml of concentrated acid. Fatal Period: 12–18 hours post-ingestion. Signs and Symptoms Burning sensation and pain in the throat and epigastric region. Dysphagia, dyspnea, dysphonia Eructation and vomiting: Frequent belching and vomiting. Thirst: Present (worsened vomiting by drinking fluids) Vomitus: Strongly acidic, contains altered blood and mucous shreds. Teeth: Become chalky white and brittle. Constipation: Usually present. Urination: Suppressed. Tenesmus present Nature of stool: Presence of mucus and altered blood. Tenderness over the abdomen Abdominal stiffness due to peritonitis Abdominal distension: Uncommon. Skin and mucous membrane erosion: Especially on the mouth, lips, and fingers; blackening and excoriation occur. Stomach Perforation: Frequently seen. Cause of Death Shock, stomach perforation, peritonitis, laryngeal spasm, and malnutrition from esophageal stricture. Postmortem Findings Erosion of skin and mouth angles, black charring of the stomach, stomach perforation, and swelling in the liver and kidneys. Perforation of stomach Thinning of posterior wall of the stomach Medico-Legal Aspects Often occurs accidentally (mistaken for glycerin) or in suicide cases. Rarely associated with homicide. May be used as an abortifacient or for vitriolage (acid attacks). Bright red lividity (Option A): This is typically associated with carbon monoxide poisoning, not sulfuric acid poisoning. Greenish discoloration of the skin (Option C): This is more typical of certain copper compounds , not sulfuric acid poisoning.. Yellowish staining and necrosis of the lips and mouth (Option D): This is typically associated with nitric acid poisoning.",

      "options": {
        "A": "All except D",
        "B": "All except A and B",
        "C": "Only C and E",
        "D": "Only E"
      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: C) Only C and E Explanation: Gastric lavage can be performed with caution for carbolic acid (Phenol) poisoning using lukewarm water, charcoal, olive oil, or magnesium sulfate. Care is taken to prevent further absorption of the corrosive substance. In oxalic acid poisoning, gastric lavage with calcium lactate (2 tsp/lavage) is done Type of Poison Management Mineral Acids (Sulphuric acid, Nitric acid, Hydrochloric acid) Avoid gastric lavage/emetics. Dilute by giving milk or water. Administer 4 tablespoons of aluminum hydroxide gel. Provide demulcents (olive oil, milk, egg white, starch water, butter). Avoid bicarbonate or neutralizing agents. Prednisolone: 60 mg/day in divided doses. Treat shock with IV fluids, blood products (if bleeding), and antibiotics (if perforation is suspected). Tracheostomy for glottic edema. Nothing by mouth for a week, followed by IV nutrients, gradually reintroducing liquids, soft foods, and regular diet. Morphine for pain relief. Symptomatic treatment. Organic Acids Oxalic Acid Gastric lavage with calcium lactate (2 tsp/lavage). Antidotes: Limewater, calcium lactate, calcium gluconate/chloride (150 mg/kg orally) to form insoluble calcium oxalate for excretion. Calcium gluconate: 10 ml of 10% solution IV frequently. Parathyroid extracts: 100 units IM. Bowel management: Demulcent drinks, enemas, purgatives. Hemodialysis/exchange transfusion if needed. Symptomatic treatment. Carbolic Acid (Phenol) Gastric lavage (done with caution) with lukewarm water, charcoal, olive oil, MgSO4, or Na2SO4. Leave medicinal liquid paraffin or 30 g MgSO4 in the stomach after lavage. Provide demulcents. IV saline with 7 g NaHCO3/l to manage circulatory depression, dilute carbolic acid and promote diuresis. If phenol contacts the skin: Remove contaminated clothing, wash with soap and water, and apply olive oil/methylated spirit. Emetics have a limited role. Alkalis Gastric lavage/emetics contraindicated. Immediately dilute with water. Give demulcents (egg white, milk). Administer O2 inhalation in case of ammonia vapor poisoning Maintain airway, tracheostomy if needed. Administer parenteral analgesics and antibiotics. Steroids contraindicated if esophageal perforation is present. Note: Alkali will cause liquefactive necrosis-more toxic Acid will cause coagulative necrosis Reference: Goutam Biswas Review of Forensic Medicine and Toxicology, 3rd Edition, Page 483, 485, 487",
