Symptoms like sweating, dry mouth, mydriasis, hypertension, tachycardia, mood change, etc. Bizarre perceptual changes: Faces and body parts appear distorted, objects undulate, sounds may be amplified and distorted, and colours seem brighter with halos around them. Flashback phenomenon: The individual experiences a recurrence of the emotional and psychological aspects from the previous LSD trip. Management Anti-anxiety drugs (Low dose) Benzodiazepines (Diazepam) Prolonged talking involves verbal reassurance to keep the person grounded and reduce paranoia. Psychotherapy MDMA (Methylene-dioxy-methamphetamine) (Option A) , commonly known as Ecstasy, Molly, or the party/club drug, is a stimulant with hallucinogenic properties that induce euphoria. Specific manifestations include increased energy, emotional warmth, heightened sensory perception, and distorted time perception. It is often used in social settings like raves or clubs for its mood-enhancing effects. Amphetamine (Option B) is a CNS and cardiac stimulant that increases dopamine and norepinephrine levels, leading to euphoria. Clinical features include tachycardia, hypertension, seizures, hyperpyrexia, tremors, and pupillary dilatation. Psychiatric effects include anxiety, irritability, panic, and insomnia. Heroin (Diacetylmorphine) (Option D) , also known as Smack or Dope, causes euphoria, respiratory depression, hypotension, bradycardia , sedation, miosis , and coma .

Physostigmine 1mg IV (hourly) is used as an antidote for datura poisoning. Datura contains hyoscine (scopolamine), hyoscyamine and traces of atropine Mechanism of Action: Initially, it stimulates the higher centers of the brain and then activates the motor centers. Later, it leads to depression of the vital centers in the medulla, resulting in paralysis. Clinical features: Dryness of mouth and throat Dysphagia Difficulty in talking Hoarseness of voice Flushed face Pupil dilatation Photophobia + Diplopia Agitation and restlessness Delirium Urinary retention Dry and hot skin Exfoliation of skin may occur Patients can end up in a coma, or death can occur due to respiratory paralysis. Treatment Gastrointestinal decontamination: Administer activated charcoal to absorb toxins. Use a cathartic if indicated. Antidote: Administer Physostigmine 1-2 mg IV slowl y, repeating as necessary based on symptom response. Symptomatic treatment: Consider Pilocarpine 5 mg subcutaneously for severe anticholinergic effects. Supportive care: Monitor vital signs and address any respiratory or cardiovascular issues.
