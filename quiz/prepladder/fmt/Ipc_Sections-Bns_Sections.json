      "explanation": "Correct Answer: B) Septicemia Explanation: While septicemia is a common complication in criminal abortions, it usually takes time to develop and is considered a delayed cause of death rather than an immediate cause of death. Immediate cause Delayed cause (onset within 48 hrs to 72 hrs) Remote cause 1) Vagal inhibition 2) Air embolism 3) Hemorrhage 4) Fat embolism 5) Amniotic fluid embolism 6) Rarely poisoning. 1) Septicemia 2) Pyaemia 3) Confined local infection and toxemia 4) General peritonitis 5) Tetanus. 1) Jaundice and renal failure 2) Bacterial endocarditis 3) Pulmonary embolism. Fat embolism (Option A): Fat embolism can occur during illegal abortions, especially if bones are fractured or fatty tissues are disturbed, leading to embolic events. Amniotic fluid embolism (Option C): Although rare, amniotic fluid embolism can be a cause of sudden death in both criminal and legal abortions, particularly if the uterine wall is breached. Vagal inhibition (Option D): Vagal inhibition, due to sudden pain or manipulation, can lead to reflex cardiac arrest, an immediate cause of death in such cases.

      "explanation": "intended to cause death. Correct Answer: A) The person dies due to an injury that, under normal circumstances, was not intended to cause death. Explanation: This situation involves an unintended fatal outcome, which falls under the category of culpable homicide or accidental death, not grievous hurt. Grievous hurt pertains to severe injuries, not necessarily causing death. BNS 116 (Old Section 320 IPC) defines following injuries as grievous: Emasculation (cutting off the penis, castration, or causing loss of power of erection due to spinal injury). Permanent privation of the sight of either eye. Permanent privation of the hearing of either ear.

Fracture or dislocation of a bone or a tooth.

The person suffers an abdominal injury causing the intestines to protrude and is hospitalized for 22 days (Option B): This is classified as grievous hurt because it causes serious injury that can endanger life and requires significant medical intervention. The person sustains a deep injury without any fracture or permanent disfigurement (Option C): A deep injury may cause considerable pain or disability, but without a fracture or permanent disfigurement, it does not meet the legal criteria for grievous hurt. The person is in a coma for 20 days following a severe head injury (Option D): Prolonged unconsciousness or coma due to head injury is considered grievous hurt, as it severely affects the victim's capacity to follow ordinary pursuits.

      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: A) BNS Section 271 Explanation : A man, unaware of his HIV-positive status, engages in unprotected intercourse with his partner. She contracts HIV. Option Section Pertains To Applicability in Case BNS 271 (Option A) Negligent act likely to spread infection Requires knowledge or reason to believe the act is likely to spread infection. Not applicable â€“ he was unaware. BNS 272 (Option B ruled out) Adulteration of food/drug Related to tampering with consumables . Not related. BNS 106A (Option C ruled out) Organised crime/terror-related offences Not related to infectious disease or health violations . Not applicable. BNS 109 (Option D ruled out) Abetment of an offence Secondary offence when someone aids/instigates a crime. Not primary here. If the individual was truly unaware of his HIV status and had no reason to suspect infection , none of the sections listed apply directly . However, if evidence later shows : He had prior symptoms or risk factors, Was advised to get tested, Or had past risk exposure (e.g., unprotected sex, blood transfusion, drug use), Then BNS Section 271 might be considered (i.e., negligent transmission , if he should have known ). Conclusion: None of the options strictly apply if he was genuinely unaware of his status. If one must be chosen based on legal proximity , then: Answer: A) BNS Section 271 , only if there was reasonable belief or negligence in not getting tested.
