      },
      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "to a mental defect. Correct Answer: C) The accused could not understand the nature or wrongness of their actions due to a mental defect. Explanation: the McNaughten Rule , which is the legal test for insanity recognised in Section 22 of the Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita (BNS), 2023 , derived from Section 84 of the Indian Penal Code (IPC) . Section 22, BNS states: \"Nothing is an offence which is done by a person who, at the time of doing it, by reason of unsoundness of mind, is incapable of knowing the nature of the act, or that he is doing what is either wrong or contrary to law.\" The principle focuses on cognitive incapacity — not knowing the nature or wrongfulness of the act. Lucid Interval: Definition : A period during insanity when symptoms completely disappear. Judgment : Individual can soundly judge their actions and are legally liable. Variability : Duration varies between individuals and over time for the same individual. Legal Implications : Difficulty in determining mental state at the time of an offence complicates full responsibility. Common in : Conditions like mania and melancholia. During a lucid interval, an individual is capable of sound judgment and understanding their actions, making them legally responsible for their conduct. If a crime is committed during this period, according to the McNaghten Rule , the individual could be held accountable for their actions. Sec. 84 IPC deals with the criminal responsibility of insane persons. It states that: “Nothing is an offence which is done by a person who, at the time of doing it, because of unsoundness of mind, is incapable of knowing the nature of the act, or what he is doing is either wrong or contrary to the law”. BNS Section 22: Nothing is an offence done by a person who, at the time of doing it, because of unsoundness of mind, is incapable of knowing the nature of the act, or that he is doing what is either wrong or contrary to law. McNaughten Rule: The key principle states that every person is presumed sane until proven otherwise. To establish a defence of insanity, it must be proven that the accused, at the time of the act, had a mental disease that prevented them from understanding the nature of the act or recognising it as wrong. Legal Test of Insanity (Right or Wrong Test): A person is not criminally responsible if they did not know the nature of their act or that it was wrong at the time of the crime. Requirements include: Evidence of a mental disease. The mental",

      "options": {
        "A": "Curren’s Rule",
        "B": "Durham’s Rule",
        "C": "American Law Institute Test",
        "D": "Morrison's Rule"
      },
      "correct_answer": "D",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: D) Morrison's Rule Explanation: Morrison’s Rule is not a recognised rule related to the criminal responsibility of insane individuals. Morrison's Rule states that after five months of fetal development, the crown-heel length in centimetres can be divided by five to estimate the fetal age in months. This provides a simple method for assessing gestational age based on fetal size. Criminal responsibility of insane persons rules: Durham’s Rule (1954) : An accused is not criminally responsible if their unlawful act results from a mental disease or defect. (Option B ruled out) Curren’s Rule (1964) : An accused is not criminally responsible if, due to a mental disease or defect, they were unable to regulate their conduct according to the law at the time of the act. (Option A ruled out) American Law Institute Test (1970) : A person is not responsible for criminal actions if, due to mental disease or defect, they lack adequate capacity to understand the wrongfulness of their actions or to conform to legal requirements. (Option C ruled out) Brawner Rule (1972) : Insanity determinations should be made by a jury, which has the discretion to decide the \"insanity question.\" The Irresistible Impulse : This rule posits that an individual may recognize an act as illegal but, due to mental impairment, cannot control their actions. For example, Lorena Bobbitt was acquitted in 1994 by arguing that an irresistible impulse led her to commit her crime.

        "D": "A holographic will must be entirely in the testator's handwriting and meet specific validity criteria."
      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: B) Mentally ill individuals can serve as guardians for their own property. managers under the Mental Healthcare Act, 2017 or Guardians and Wards Act, 1890 , when a person is mentally incapable of managing their property. Mentally ill individuals cannot be entrusted with the management of their own or others’ estates. This also aligns with Section 22 of BNS, 2023 , which replaces IPC Section 84 and states that a person incapable of understanding the nature of their act due to mental illness is not criminally liable , further indicating lack of civil capacity. Forensic-Legal Notes: Section 22, BNS 2023 (Replaces IPC Sec 84): Protects mentally ill individuals from criminal liability if incapable of understanding their actions. Section 89, IPC/BNS: Consent by children under 12 or by persons of unsound mind is invalid; only the guardian’s consent is valid for acts done in good faith for their benefit. Section 90, IPC/BNS: Consent is invalid if given by someone incapable of understanding the nature and consequences of the act due to unsoundness of mind or intoxication, or if given under fear or misconception of fact. Section 118, Indian Evidence Act : Mentally ill individuals can testify only if capable of understanding questions and giving rational answers . Civil Law presumes mental competence unless legally proven otherwise . A contract is void if one party lacks mental capacity at the time of the agreement (Option A): Indian Contract Act, 1872 (Section 11) states that a person must be of sound mind to enter into a valid contract. If proven that a party lacked mental capacity at the time, the contract is void ab initio , unless made during a lucid interval . Such an individual is deemed legally incapable of understanding or forming rational judgments required for binding agreements. The Hindu Marriage Act permits annulment if one party is mentally unfit at the time of the ceremony (Option C): Hindu Marriage Act, 1955 – Section 5(ii) : Declares a marriage invalid if either party was incapable of giving valid consent due to unsoundness of mind. Annulment is permissible if one party is mentally unfit for marriage or procreation. Under Muslim law , a woman may seek divorce if the husband suffers from insanity for over 2 years . A holographic will must be entirely in the testator's handwriting and meet specific validity criteria (Option D): Though not specifically defined under Indian law, a holographic will is recognised as valid if: It is entirely handwritten and signed by the testator. Meets the criteria under Section 63 of the Indian Succession Act, 1925 . The testator must be of sound mind at the time of making the will (Testamentary Capacity). Individuals who are intoxicated , delusional , or suffering from advanced mental illness at the time cannot make valid wills.",

      "options": {
        "A": "Hallucination occurs with external stimuli, while illusion occurs without any stimuli.",
        "B": "Hallucination is a false perception without an external stimulus, while illusion is a misinterpretation",
        "C": "Hallucination and illusion are both voluntary perceptions of external objects.",
        "D": "Hallucination is always visual, while illusion is always auditory."
      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "a misinterpretation of a real external stimulus. Correct Answer: B) Hallucination is a false perception without an external stimulus, while illusion is a misinterpretation of a real external stimulus. Explanation: Hallucinations involve perceptions without any actual external stimuli, while illusions are distortions or misinterpretations of real stimuli. For example, seeing objects that do not exist (hallucination) versus mistaking a rope for a snake (illusion). Hallucination: Hallucination is a false perception experienced by the senses without any external stimulus. It can occur in conditions like insanity, high fever, drug intoxication, and withdrawal. (Option A ruled out) Types of Hallucinations: (Option D ruled out) Visual : Seeing non-existent sights, common in disorders like schizophrenia and conversion disorder. Auditory (most common type) : Hearing sounds or voices without a source, prevalent in schizophrenia. Olfactory : False perception of smells, often associated with schizophrenia and temporal lobe epilepsy. Gustatory : Experiencing tastes without food, noted in certain medical conditions. Tactile : Feeling sensations like crawling insects on the skin, seen in cocaine use and schizophrenia. Psychomotor : Feeling movement in body parts without actual movement. Lilliputian : Perception of objects being smaller than they are, more like an illusion. Auditory hallucinations are the most common , followed by visual ones. Hallucinations are involuntary and can lead to dangerous behaviours. Some auditory hallucinations occurring while falling asleep ( hypnagogic ) or waking up ( hypnopompic ) are considered normal experiences. Illusion: Illusion is a false interpretation of an external object or stimulus that has real existence. (Option A ruled out) It can be classified as: Universal Illusions: Common to all individuals and unchanging, such as the appearance of converging railway tracks. Personal Illusions: Vary between individuals, such as misidentifying a doctor as a family member or mistaking a dog for a lion. A sane person can correct these false impressions, while an insane person persists in believing them despite clear evidence. Illusions are often associated with psychoses, particularly of the organic type. Hallucination and illusion are both voluntary perceptions of external objects. (Option C): Both hallucinations and illusions are involuntary; individuals cannot control these experiences, especially hallucinations.

Criminal Responsibility in Specific Cases: Delirium: Type: Organic mental disorder. Definition: An acute reversible mental disorder characterised by confusion and impaired consciousness. Context: Occurs in individuals with high fever, overwork, mental stress, acute poisoning, or chronic alcohol/drug intoxication. (Option A) Criminal Responsibility : Individuals may not be responsible for criminal acts due to impaired consciousness and irrational behaviour. Run Amok : (Run Amok) Definition: Describes an individual engaging in frenzied violence without clear provocation. Cultural Context: Aligns with Section 84 of the IPC , stating that a person is not liable for acts committed under unsoundness of mind. Causes of run amok: Chronic poisoning of Cannabis sativa Somnambulism (Sleepwalking) : Category: Parasomnia involving automatic motor activity during sleep with no recollection upon waking. (Option B) Criminal Responsibility : Individuals committing criminal acts during sleepwalking episodes are not held responsible. Sleep disorders in different phases of the cycle: Sleep apnea It occurs in the deeper sleep phases, primarily affecting stage N3 and REM sleep. Narcolepsy It involves skipping initial sleep phases and directly entering REM sleep, leading to persistent daytime sleepiness. This results in reduced N3 deep sleep and irregular sleep patterns. REM sleep disorder It involves acting out dreams with vocalizations and movements due to disrupted muscle atonia during REM sleep. Somnambulism or sleepwalking It occurs during non-REM sleep, typically in the N3 phase. This is when individuals can make purposeful movements without acting out their dreams, which happens in REM sleep. Sleep Drunkenness : Definition: A form of hypersomnia where individuals experience confusion and disorientation during the transition from sleep to wakefulness. Criminal Responsibility : Individuals are not responsible for violent acts performed while in this state. Kleptomania : Type : Impulse disorder characterised by a compulsion to steal items of little value. Criminal Responsibility : Courts may consider kleptomania as a mental disorder affecting impulse control (not guilty under the New Hampshire Doctrine), which could influence sentencing or lead to treatment rather than punishment. (MHCA 2017) Hypnosis : (Option D) Context: Not explicitly addressed but related to \"delusion of influence/control\".
