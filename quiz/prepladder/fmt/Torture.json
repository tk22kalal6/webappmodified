      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: B) Consent of kin is required Explanation: Consent of kin is not required for medicolegal autopsy but is required for pathological autopsy. Medicolegal autopsy/necropsy/postmortem examination - specialized scientific examination of a deceased body conducted primarily for legal purposes. A complete autopsy is a detailed examination of the entire body, both internally and externally, including the brain, chest and abdominal organs, and musculoskeletal systems. Objectives Identification and determination of cause and time of death For newborn infants, determine whether the child was born alive and viable For mutilated, fragmented, or skeletal remains, determine if they are human, the probable cause of death, and the time since death Restore the body to the best possible cosmetic condition before releasing it to relatives Essential Requirements Performed by a registered medical practitioner with specialized training or experience in forensic medicine (forensic pathology) Meticulous examination Complete autopsy (Option A ruled out) Materials sent to forensic science laboratory Preservation of records and evidence Objective reporting to the police or magistrate is required.

      "correct_answer": "D",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: D) All except 2 and 5 Explanation: Virtual autopsy/Virtopsy Virtopsy is a non-invasive alternative to traditional autopsy using imaging instead of physical dissection. Technology Utilizes 3D surface scanning, MSCT, MRI, and CAD photogrammetry to create a digital, objective record. (Option D) This can be shared online for secondary opinions and presented as evidence in court if required. Features Provides high-resolution, colored 3D images in various sections Allows visualization of body surfaces, deeper tissues, organs, coronary vessels, pulmonary emboli, soft tissue trauma, and bone injuries Limitations High cost of equipment Radiologic imaging limitations, interference from metal Limited ability to distinguish internal organ colors Incomplete database for diagnosis Challenges in identifying infection status , antemortem vs. postmortem wounds (Options B and C ruled out) Difficulty in identifying postmortem artifacts and subtle tissue injuries, and differentiating certain pathological conditions (Option D) Psychological autopsy - Meticulous collection of data after someone’s suicide to understand the circumstances of their death.

      "question": "A 60-year-old male patient was found deceased under unknown circumstances, and a detailed autopsy was requested to investigate possible causes of death.

      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: C) Modified Y-shaped incision Explanation In forensic autopsies, the modified Y-shaped incision is preferable when: Aesthetic appearance is important (e.g., in cases where the body will be displayed). Thorough exposure of thoracic and abdominal organs is required. There is a need to preserve the appearance of the neck and face , especially in females. Comparison of Incisions: Incision Type Description Use Case I-shaped incision (Option A) Straight vertical cut from suprasternal notch to pubic symphysis Rarely used, limited exposure Y-shaped incision (Option B) From acromion processes to xiphoid, then midline to pubic symphysis Standard in adult autopsies Modified Y-shaped (Option C) Oblique cuts below the breasts (avoiding neck), then midline down Preferred for aesthetic preservation in females T-shaped incision (Option D) Horizontal cut across shoulders + vertical cut down Used when more exposure of neck and shoulders is needed",

      "question": "A 35-year-old male is found dead in his apartment under suspicious circumstances. Upon initial external examination, petechial hemorrhages are noted around the eyes. The scene suggests a possible asphyxial death, as there are no overt signs of trauma. During the autopsy by the police surgeon, which among the following has to be opened first to identify definitive signs of asphyxia?",
      "options": {
        "A": "Thoracic cavity",
        "B": "Abdominal cavity",
        "C": "Cranial cavity",
        "D": "Pelvic cavity"
      },
      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: C) Cranial cavity Explanation: In cases of suspected asphyxial death, the cranial cavity is typically opened first. The order of opening is the cranium, Thorax (Option A), abdomen, and neck. (To get a clear field of study for neck structures after draining of blood from neck vessels via the head and trunk) Asphyxial deaths frequently involve abnormalities in the lungs and airway, such as congestion, petechiae, froth in the airways, or other indicators of respiratory failure. This helps confirm if the cause of death is indeed related to impaired oxygen exchange or suffocation. Examining the heart may also reveal signs of right-sided heart failure due to hypoxia. Abdomen is first to be opened in stillbirth Order of Opening Cavities Head Injury Cases, Asphyxial Deaths The skull opened before the thorax and abdomen. Pneumothorax, Venous air embolism The Thorax opened first, then the skull. Abdominal cavity (Option B): While the abdominal cavity could be opened to assess for trauma or distension, these findings are less likely to provide direct clues in cases of asphyxia unless abdominal trauma is suspected, which is not indicated here. Thus, it is typically examined after the thoracic cavity. Pelvic cavity (Option D): Trauma to the pelvic organs or fractures is more relevant in cases involving physical injury or sexual assault. These findings are not directly associated with asphyxial deaths, so this cavity is not examined first.

      "question": "A 28-year-old man is found dead at home and poisoning is suspected. During the autopsy, the forensic pathologist decides to dissect the stomach to examine its contents.

        "D": "Incise the stomach along the pylorus and drain the contents into the small intestine"
      },
      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "toxicology Correct Answer: C) Open the stomach along the greater curvature and collect the contents for toxicology Explanation : In forensic autopsies, the stomach is usually opened along the greater curvature to minimize disruption of stomach anatomy and allows the pathologist to collect and examine the stomach contents effectively, which is critical in cases of suspected poisoning. Procedure for Stomach Dissection: Two ligatures are applied at the cardiac end of the esophagus and two ligatures are below the pyloric end of the stomach. The stomach is removed by cutting between the double ligatures at both ends. The stomach is then opened along the greater curvature . The mucous membrane is examined for the presence of any stains, congestion, hemorrhage, desquamation, ulceration, sloughing, or perforation. The contents of the stomach are noted with respect to quantity, nature of material/food, state of digestion, color, and smell.

      "explanation": "Correct Answer: C) Only B and E Explanation : In India, only specific magistrates can order exhumation: First Class, District, Sub-Divisional, Executive Magistrates. Law enforcement cannot order exhumation independently. Exhumation Legal disinterment of a previously buried body. Conducted when post-burial examination is necessary. Common Reasons Criminal Cases: Re-examine suspected homicides disguised as suicides/accidents. Investigate deaths from criminal abortion or negligence. Retrieve evidence (e.g., bullets). Civil Cases: Insurance/worker's compensation claims. Professional negligence cases. Inheritance disputes or identity verification. Correct burial errors (If the wrong body was buried) Procedure Requirements Timing & Personnel: Must be conducted during daylight (start in the morning). A medical officer, magistrate, and police officer are required. Documentation: Verify grave location and markers. Collect soil samples (above, below, and beside the body/coffin). Document body position and appearance. Create a detailed grave diagram. Photograph grave, coffin, and body. Handling Guidelines Avoid altering the body (no use of disinfectants or pesticides). Use plank or plastic sheet for removal if decomposition is minimal. Transport the body to the mortuary for post-mortem examination.
