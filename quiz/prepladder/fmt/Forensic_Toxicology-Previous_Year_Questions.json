      "correct_answer": "D",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: D) Methanol Explanation A \"hooch tragedy\" refers to incidents of poisoning caused by the consumption of illicit or adulterated alcohol. Methanol, a toxic alcohol, is often found in illegally brewed liquor as a contaminant. Ingesting methanol leads to metabolic acidosis, blindness, and potentially fatal outcomes due to its toxic metabolites, formaldehyde and formic acid. Phosphorus (Option A): Phosphorus poisoning typically occurs due to ingestion of rodenticides or fireworks, causing severe gastrointestinal and hepatic damage. It is not related to hooch tragedies. Mercury (Option B): Mercury poisoning occurs due to exposure to mercury compounds, causing neurological and renal toxicity. It is unrelated to alcohol adulteration. Ethanol (Option C): Ethanol is the active ingredient in alcoholic beverages and is generally not the cause of toxicity in hooch tragedies. The issue \"hooch tragedy\" occurred when ethanol was adulterated with methanol. Reference: pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3665074/",

      },
      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: A) Atropine Explanation The symptoms described—sweating, lacrimation, diarrhea, and bradycardia—are consistent with cholinergic toxicity, commonly caused by organophosphate or carbamate poisoning. Atropine is the first-line treatment for cholinergic toxicity. It is a muscarinic receptor antagonist that counteracts the effects of excessive acetylcholine at muscarinic receptors, reducing secretions, bradycardia, and other parasympathetic symptoms. Symptoms Muscarinic: Lethargy, Salivation, Diarrhea, Lacrimation, Urination, Miosis, Muscle weakness, Bronchorrhea, Bronchospasm, Bradycardia, Emesis (Mnemonic: DUMBBELLS) Nicotinic: Muscle weakness, Fasciculation, Areflexia, Muscle paralysis CNS: Headache, Tremor, Confusion, Slurred speech, Coma, Convulsion Laboratory Diagnosis RBC/True Cholinesterase (specific) Plasma/Pseudocholinesterase (Most common) Falls rapidly with organophosphorus poisoning Inexpensive, sensitive) Atropine test : If 2 mg of Atropine relieves symptoms, it confirms OP poisoning P-nitro phenol test for confirmation. Management Resuscitative measures (Airway-Breathing-Circulation) Decontamination Gastric lavage with 1:5000 KMnO4 Activated charcoal Atropine sulfate (2-4 mg IV every 10-15 minutes until atropinization) Signs of atropinization: Heart rate>80 beats/min, pupils no longer pinpoint, clear chest on auscultation with no wheeze, systolic BP>80mmHg, Dry axillae Oximes (Pralidoxime) to decrease muscarinic and CNS symptoms removes phosphate group reduces atropine requirement Cause of Death Respiratory Muscle Paralysis (RMP) Calcium gluconate (Option B): Used primarily for hyperkalemia, hypocalcemia, or calcium channel blocker toxicity. It does not address cholinergic symptoms. Pralidoxime (Option C): Pralidoxime (2-PAM) reactivates acetylcholinesterase inhibited by organophosphates. It is used alongside atropine but is not the initial management step . Atropine is given first to stabilize the patient. Obidoxime (Option D): Similar to pralidoxime, obidoxime is an oxime used to reactivate acetylcholinesterase. However, it is not the primary treatment for immediate symptom control.

      "question": "Gastric lavage, commonly known as stomach pumping or gastric irrigation, is a procedure performed to remove the contents of the stomach. It has been widely used since the early 19th century as a standard method to eliminate toxins from the stomach. This procedure is typically employed for individuals who have consumed poison or overdosed on substances like ethanol. Additionally, it may be performed prior to surgery to empty the digestive tract. In which of the following situations is gastric lavage not recommended?",

      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: B) Hydrocarbons Explanation: Gastric Lavage in Poisoning Management Gastric lavage is a procedure to remove ingested poison by introducing and withdrawing fluids through an orogastric tube. Its effectiveness depends on timing, proper technique, and patient-specific considerations. Timing and Effectiveness Most effective within 1 hour of ingestion Can be beneficial up to 4-6 hours in select cases Beyond 6 hours , poison likely passes into the intestines, reducing lavage efficacy Procedure Steps Step Details Patient Positioning Trendelenburg: Head down to prevent aspiration Left lateral decubitus: Reduces chance of poison entering the duodenum Tube Placement Confirmation Inject air and listen for gastric bubbling sounds Watch for coughing or bubbles (indicates misplacement in trachea) Fluid Administration Fluid is administered and aspirated using a syringe attached to the tube Fluid Selection Tap water for most cases Normal saline for infants Specific solutions (e.g., potassium permanganate) may be used for certain poisons Residual Fluid Leave a small amount of fluid to neutralize remaining poison Contraindications Corrosive Poisoning : Avoid except for carbolic acid (phenol) to prevent perforation Convulsant Poisons : Risk of triggering seizures (e.g., strychnine) Comatose Patients : High aspiration risk Volatile Poisons/ Hydrocarbons : May cause aspiration pneumonitis Risk of Hemorrhage/ Perforation : Avoid if esophageal varices or recent surgery present Additional Contraindications to Emetics Severe heart or lung diseases Advanced pregnancy CNS depression or seizures Complications Complication Details Aspiration Occurs in ~10% of cases. Risk of lung injury Esophageal/Gastric Perforation Can be life-threatening Tube Misplacement Misplaced into trachea, causing complications Bleeding Can occur with improper technique or pathology Alternatives to Gastric Lavage Alternative Description Emetics Induce vomiting in conscious patients Dilution Large water intake to dilute corrosive substances Endoscopic/Surgical Removal Used for toxic foreign bodies or drug packets Incorrect Options: Organophosphate poisoning (Option A): Gastric lavage is recommended for organophosphate poisoning (e.g., insecticides) because it can effectively remove the poison from the stomach if performed early, particularly within 1 hour of ingestion. The risks of aspiration or complications are considered manageable in this case with proper techniques. Ethanol poisoning (Option C): Gastric lavage is recommended in cases of ethanol poisoning if it is performed within 1 hour of ingestion. Ethanol is rapidly absorbed, so the procedure is most effective if performed early. Gastric lavage may help prevent further absorption of the alcohol and reduce toxicity.

      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer B - Greater curvature In forensic autopsies, the stomach is usually opened along the greater curvature to minimize disruption of stomach anatomy and allows the pathologist to collect and examine the stomach contents effectively, which is critical in cases of suspected poisoning. Procedure for Stomach Dissection: Two ligatures are applied at the cardiac end of the esophagus and two ligatures are below the pyloric end of the stomach. The stomach is removed by cutting between the double ligatures at both ends. The stomach is then opened along the greater curvature . The mucous membrane is examined for the presence of any stains, congestion, hemorrhage, desquamation, ulceration, sloughing, or perforation. The contents of the stomach are noted with respect to quantity, nature of material/food, state of digestion, color, and smell.

      },
      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer C - Huffing Huffing involves inhaling the vapors of an inhalant, typically from a cloth or rag soaked in volatile solvents. It is a method where the substance is directly inhaled through the mouth, and a cloth soaked in the drug is commonly used for this method. Inhalants are substances that produce intoxicating vapors when inhaled, often used by young adolescents. They can cause severe health issues, including cardiac arrest, suffocation, and long-term damage to the brain, heart, kidneys, and liver. Types of Inhalants: Volatile Solvents : Liquids that vaporize at room temperature, found in household and business products like paint thinners, dry-cleaning fluids, gasoline, glues, and felt-tip markers. Aerosols : Products that release vapors when sprayed, such as spray paints, deodorant sprays, hair sprays, and cooking oil sprays. Gases : Gases like nitrous oxide (laughing gas), chloroform, ether, and halothane, used in medical procedures. Also includes gases found in butane lighters, propane tanks, and refrigerants. Nitrites : Sold in small bottles called “poppers,” these primarily dilate blood vessels and relax muscles, acting differently from other inhalants that affect the central nervous system. Bagging (Option A) : This involves inhaling vapors from a substance stored in a plastic bag. It is a common method of inhaling gases or solvents but does not specifically refer to inhaling a cloth soaked in a drug. Spraying (Option B) : This refers to inhaling vapors directly from an aerosol or spray can, such as spray paints or deodorant sprays. It is a method of inhaling aerosol inhalants, but it does not apply to inhaling from a cloth soaked in a drug. Sniffing (Option D) : This involves inhaling vapors directly from a container or surface, such as sniffing glue or other substances. However, it does not specifically refer to inhaling from a cloth soaked in a drug. Reference: Inhalant abuse - PMC Inhalants | National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA)",

      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer C - HCN poisoning Cyanide poisoning (HCN) causes pink skin and mucosa, bitter almond odor from the breath, and frothy discharge, which are key diagnostic clues. It is caused by the exposure to hydrogen cyanide (HCN) or cyanide salts. Cyanide interferes with cellular respiration by inhibiting cytochrome c oxidase , an enzyme in the mitochondria, leading to histotoxic anoxia (cells cannot use oxygen, even when it is available in the bloodstream). Cyanide poisoning Physical Appearance Gaseous state- Hydrogen cyanide (HCN) Liquid form- Hydrocyanic acid or Prussic acid Solid state- salt forms Sources of poisoning Electroplating , photographic processes, rubber, and plastic manufacturing industries Insecticide and rodenticide Drug toxicity: Sodium nitroprusside Military chemical warfare agents Burning of plastic furniture, silk, or wool Cigarette smoking Bitter almonds, peach, apricot, plum, apple, pear, cassava Mode of Action Rapid absorption across both skin and mucous membrane Cyanide salts combine with hydrochloric acid in the stomach to form HCN that is absorbed Inhibition of cytochrome oxidase causes histotoxic anoxia Neurotoxicity Clinical Features Inhalation: Dizziness, vertigo, and constriction of the throat Ingestion: Nausea, headache, loss of muscular power, hypotension, cardiovascular failure, and convulsion Skin: Brick-red color of skin and mucous membranes Anion gap metabolic acidosis and lactic acidosis Diagnosis Lee-Jones test Serum cyanide level Treatment Severe acidosis (pH < 7.1): Administer sodium bicarbonate Antidotal therapy (Eli Lilly cyanide kit approach) First step: Inhalation of Amyl nitrite Second step: Sodium nitrite (3% solution) IV Third step: Sodium thiosulfate (25% solution) IV Other Antidotes 4-dimethylaminophenol (4-DMAP) Hydroxocobalamin (Vitamin B12): Combines with cyanide to form cyanocobalamin, which is excreted in the urine Hyperbaric oxygen Note: Methylene blue is NOT an antidote for cyanide and must NOT be used Autopsy Findings Bitter almond’s odour Brick-red color of skin and mucous membranes Cyanosis of extremities Hemorrhagic gastritis Disseminated petechiae in brain, meninges, pleura, lungs, and pericardium Pulmonary and cerebral edema Note: Mechanism of action of nitrites: It converts hemoglobin to methemoglobinemia which causes the detachment of cyanide from the heme group of cytochrome oxidase. Mechanism of action of sodium thiosulfate: Forms non-toxic thiocyanate which is excreted in the urine. H2S poisoning (Option A) : Hydrogen sulfide (H2S) poisoning typically presents with rotten egg smell from the breath, not the bitter almond smell seen in cyanide poisoning. Symptoms include headache, dizziness, nausea, vomiting, and in severe cases, respiratory failure. The skin typically does not have the pink color seen in cyanide poisoning. CO poisoning (Option B) : Carbon monoxide (CO) poisoning leads to a cherry-red skin color , not pink as seen in cyanide poisoning. The breath does not have a bitter almond smell, and the classic symptoms are headache, dizziness, confusion, and weakness, not frothy discharge. OPC poisoning (Option D) : Organophosphate (OP) poisoning typically presents with symptoms such as muscarinic effects (e.g., excessive salivation, lacrimation, urination, diarrhea, gastrointestinal distress) and nicotinic effects (muscle weakness, paralysis). The skin does not have a characteristic pink color, and there is no bitter almond odor from the breath. Frothy discharge is not a typical symptom of OPC poisoning.",

      "correct_answer": "D",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer D - Lead Lead is a toxic substance that can be released from retained lead bullets , especially if the bullet is lodged in the body for a prolonged period. Lead gradually leaches into the bloodstream and can cause neurological issues (e.g., confusion, memory problems, and in extreme cases, encephalopathy), kidney damage , gastrointestinal symptoms , and anemia . Causes of Chronic Lead Poisoning: Ingestion or Inhalation of lead-containing dust.: Most common source Lead Paint Dust: Major source for children, especially those under 3 years old. Children are at greater risk due to pica (eating non-nutritive materials). Inhalation by Occupational Exposure: Workers in industries such as white lead manufacturing, lead paint production, plumbing, glass polishing, printing, and glass blowing are at risk. Contaminated Drinking Water: Absorption of lead from water stored in lead cisterns. Lead in Tinned Food Cosmetics and Hair Dyes Petrol and Gasoline: Percutaneous absorption of tetraethyl lead Lead absorption from vermilion (red pigment) used on the scalp. Lead poisoning can result from retained lead bullets or projectiles lodged in the body. Iron (Option A) : Not related to retained bullets. Iron poisoning typically occurs from ingesting large amounts of iron and affects the gastrointestinal system, liver, and kidneys. Phosphorus (Option B) : Occurs from exposure to white phosphorus and causes damage to the liver, but not associated with retained bullets.

      "explanation": "Correct Answer: A) Bradycardia Explanation: Organophosphate (OP) poisoning causes cholinergic overstimulation by inhibiting acetylcholinesterase , leading to accumulation of acetylcholine at muscarinic and nicotinic receptors. Atropine is a muscarinic antagonist , used to treat the muscarinic symptoms of OP poisoning. OPC poisoning: Symptoms Muscarinic: Lethargy, Salivation, Diarrhea, Lacrimation, Urination, Miosis, Muscle weakness, Bronchorrhea, Bronchospasm, Bradycardia, Emesis (Mnemonic: DUMBBELLS) Nicotinic: Muscle weakness, Fasciculation, Areflexia, Muscle paralysis CNS: Headache, Tremor, Confusion, Slurred speech, Coma, Convulsion Laboratory Diagnosis RBC/True Cholinesterase (specific) Plasma/Pseudocholinesterase (Most common) Falls rapidly with organophosphorus poisoning Inexpensive, sensitive) Atropine test : If 2 mg of Atropine relieves symptoms, it confirms OP poisoning P-nitro phenol test for confirmation.

        "B": "Ischemic hypoxia",
        "C": "Anemic hypoxia",
        "D": "All of the above"
      },
      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: C) Anemic hypoxia Explanation: The primary cause of death in smoke inhalation is anemic hypoxia, which occurs due to the inability of hemoglobin to effectively transport oxygen to tissues. This condition can arise from carbon monoxide (CO) poisoning, a common consequence of smoke inhalation. CO has a much higher affinity for hemoglobin than oxygen, which leads to reduced oxygen delivery to vital organs, ultimately causing systemic hypoxia and potential organ failure. Incorrect Options: Histotoxic hypoxia (Option A) occurs when cells are unable to effectively use oxygen, often due to the presence of toxic substances, such as cyanide. While cyanide can be released during combustion, histotoxic hypoxia is not the primary cause of death in smoke inhalation. The main mechanism of death in smoke inhalation is related to the impaired ability of hemoglobin to carry oxygen, as seen in anemic hypoxia. Ischemic hypoxia (Option B) results from inadequate blood flow to tissues, which can lead to a shortage of oxygen supply. In severe cases of smoke inhalation, respiratory failure could reduce oxygen perfusion to tissues, but this is not the primary cause of death in most cases of smoke inhalation. The main issue is the impaired oxygen binding by hemoglobin due to carbon monoxide (CO), leading to anemic hypoxia. All of the above (Option D): While histotoxic hypoxia and ischemic hypoxia can be involved in some cases of smoke inhalation (especially if toxic gases like cyanide are present), anemic hypoxia is the primary cause of death in smoke inhalation due to the carbon monoxide (CO) binding to hemoglobin. Therefore, \"All of the above\" is not the correct answer.

      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "likely due to the ingestion of Datura seeds. Physostigmine 1mg IV (hourly) is used as an antidote for datura poisoning. Datura contains hyoscine (scopolamine), hyoscyamine and traces of atropine Mechanism of Action: Initially, it stimulates the higher centers of the brain and then activates the motor centers. Later, it leads to depression of the vital centers in the medulla, resulting in paralysis. Clinical features: Dryness of mouth and throat Dysphagia Difficulty in talking Hoarseness of voice Flushed face Pupil dilatation Photophobia + Diplopia Agitation and restlessness Delirium Urinary retention Dry and hot skin Exfoliation of skin may occur Patients can end up in a coma, or death can occur due to respiratory paralysis. Treatment Gastrointestinal decontamination: Administer activated charcoal to absorb toxins. Use a cathartic if indicated. Antidote: Administer Physostigmine 1-2 mg IV slowl y, repeating as necessary based on symptom response. Symptomatic treatment: Consider Pilocarpine 5 mg subcutaneously for severe anticholinergic effects. Supportive care: Monitor vital signs and address any respiratory or cardiovascular issues. Toxins and Antidotes: Toxicity Antidote Mechanism of action Datura/anticholinergics toxicity Physostigmine Inhibits acetylcholinesterase enzyme Opium Naloxone Opioid receptor antagonist Organophosphates Atropine Pralidoxime Muscarinic antagonist Cholinesterase reactivation Acetaminophen N-acetyl-cysteine Replenishes Glutathione Methanol Fomepizole Inhibitor of alcohol dehydrogenase Benzodiazepine Flumazenil Inhibits GABA receptors Cyanide Eli Lilly antidote Kit (3-step approach) Amyl nitrate: Oxidises haemoglobin to methemoglobin, which scavenges cyanide. Sodium nitrate: causes cyanide to detach from the heme group of cytochrome oxidase. Amyl nitrate is used as a temporary measure until IV Sodium nitrate can be given. Sodium thiosulphate:It activates an enzyme that converts cyanide to a less toxic agent, thiocyanate. Datura, Pralidoxime (Option A) Pralidoxime, is an antidote used for organophosphate poisoning, not specifically for Datura poisoning. Organophosphates are a different class of toxic compounds that inhibit acetylcholinesterase, but they have different mechanisms of action compared to Datura alkaloids. Yellow oleander, Digoxin and Yellow oleander, Physostigmine (Option C and D) Yellow oleander (Thevetia peruviana) is a plant that contains cardiac glycosides, particularly Thevetin A and Thevetin B. Ingestion of yellow oleander can lead to cardiac toxicity, including arrhythmias, conduction disturbances, and cardiac arrest Digoxin, is a cardiac glycoside commonly used in the treatment of heart failure and certain cardiac arrhythmias. It has a narrow therapeutic index, and overdose or toxicity can result in various cardiac manifestations, including arrhythmias.",

It produces an active poisonous component called hyoscyamine. The toxin may also be found in datura Stramonium (Jimson weed) Hyoscyamine is an isomer of Atropine and has Anticholinergic and Antimuscarinic activity. It is used as an antiemetic, anti-secretory and antispasmodic agent in the treatment of naused, motion sickness, allergic rhinitis etc. Side effects include dryness of the mouth and eyes, tachycardia, palpitations, decreased sweating, and can also produce anxiety and restlessness. Calotropis Gigantea (Option A): It is a purple colored flower which has an active poisonous principle called Calotropin, Calotoxin. Digitalis (Option B): Also called purple foxglove where the poison acts by inhibiting Na-K ATPase channel.

        "C": "Yellow phosphorus",
        "D": "Hydrogen cyanide"
      },
      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer A - CO Poisoning Carbon monoxide poisoning causes cherry red discoloration of the skin, mucus membranes, conjunctiva, nail beds, areas of hypostasis, blood tissues and internal organs. This coloration changes to dark green and then to brown as decomposition starts to occur. Post-mortem changes associated with Carbon monoxide poisoning are: Cherry-pink lividity : One of the classic signs of carbon monoxide poisoning is the development of cherry-pink lividity on the skin. This occurs due to the formation of carboxyhemoglobin, a stable complex formed when carbon monoxide binds to hemoglobin, resulting in a bright pink or cherry-red coloration of the skin. Discoloration of internal organs: Carbon monoxide poisoning can cause discoloration of internal organs. The organs may appear bright red due to the presence of carboxyhemoglobin. Pulmonary congestion and edema: Carbon monoxide can lead to congestion and fluid accumulation in the lungs, resulting in pulmonary congestion and edema. This can be observed during postmortem examination as fluid-filled lungs with frothy fluid. Macroscopic changes in the brain: Carbon monoxide poisoning can cause macroscopic changes in the brain. The brain may appear swollen and congested, and the white matter can show pink discoloration. Hydrogen Sulphide (Option B): poisoning causes a rotten egg smell in the victim. The general signs of asphyxia are present along with signs of changing of the blood and viscera colour to greenish-purple and not cherry-red. Yellow Phosphorus (Option C): is a potent hepatotoxin. Post-mortem findings include garlicky odour along with icterus of the body due to liver failure as a part of multiple organ failure which causes the death of the victim. Hydrogen cyanide (Option D): is an extremely lethal poison. Post-mortem findings of hydrogen cyanide poisoning include glistening and prominent dilated pupils, frothy mouth, brick-red blood and cheeks due to impaired oxygenation of the tissues. The internal organs may be oedematous due to congestion. Reference: CO",

      "explanation": "Correct Answer A - Fomepizole Fomepizole is a competitive inhibitor of alcohol dehydrogenase . Alcohol dehydrogenase catalyses the oxidation of ethanol to acetaldehyde. Alcohol dehydrogenase also catalyses the initial steps in the metabolism of ethylene glycol and methanol to their toxic metabolites. Features or symptoms of methanol poisoning: Gastrointestinal Distress: Nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, and diarrhea are common symptoms associated with methanol poisoning. Neurological Symptoms: Methanol toxicity affects the central nervous system and can lead to symptoms such as headache, dizziness, confusion, disorientation, agitation, and seizures. Visual Impairment: Methanol poisoning can cause visual disturbances, including blurred vision, double vision, or complete loss of vision. This is due to the toxic effect of methanol on the optic nerve. Metabolic Acidosis: Methanol is metabolized in the body to formic acid and formaldehyde, which can lead to metabolic acidosis—a disturbance in the body's acid-base balance. Symptoms of metabolic acidosis include rapid breathing, increased heart rate, and fatigue. Respiratory Distress: Severe cases of methanol poisoning may result in respiratory distress, difficulty breathing, and lung damage. Reference: Fomepizole",

      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: A) Viper Explanation The symptoms described, including drowsiness, pain around the wound, bleeding, and blisters, are consistent with a viper bite. Viper bites often lead to profuse bleeding due to the effects of venom-induced coagulopathy. Incorrect Options: Cobra (Option B): Cobra bites are primarily neurotoxic, causing paralysis, respiratory distress, and potentially death if untreated. While cobras can cause pain and local swelling, they do not typically cause the extensive bleeding or blisters seen with viper bites. Cobras do not usually cause such local tissue necrosis and blistering. Wasp bite (Option C): Wasp stings can cause pain, redness, and swelling at the sting site, but they typically do not lead to bleeding, drowsiness, or blisters. The symptoms described here are more consistent with a venomous bite from a snake rather than an insect sting. Scorpion (Option D): While scorpion stings can cause pain, local swelling, and sometimes neurological symptoms (such as drowsiness), they typically do not cause blisters or profuse bleeding at the sting site. Signs and symptoms: Dysfunction of cranial nerve and hyperexcitability of skeletal muscles developed within hours. Local : Swelling, prominent, radiating pain, paraesthesia, and hyperesthesia which is accentuated by tapping on the affected area (Tap test) Systemic effects: Restlessness, blurred vision, abnormal eye movements, profuse sweating, slurred speech, muscular fasciculations, respiratory depression and pulmonary edema. Complications : Tachycardia,hypertension, arrhythmias, hyperthermia, rhabdomyolysis and acidosis.

        "C": "Nerium odorum",
        "D": "Datura"
      },
      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: A) Strychnine Explanation Strychnine poisoning is characterized by seizures and muscle spasms, often causing arching of the back (opisthotonus). The patient is typically conscious between episodes, and the seizures are triggered by minimal stimuli. Strychnine is a potent neurotoxin that acts by blocking inhibitory neurotransmission, leading to overstimulation of the central nervous system. Source Seeds of Strychnos nux-vomica and other species of Strychnos plants found in India. Mechanism of action Stimulates all parts of the central nervous system, especially the anterior horn cells. Greatly increases reflex excitability by removing normal inhibition of motor cell stimulation, causing widespread uncontrolled motor activity of the spinal cord. Slight stimuli like noise, light, or a breeze can cause violent generalized muscle spasms Clinical Features Opisthotonos - arched body with only the back of head and heels touching the ground: Emprosthotonos- forward curve Pleurothotonus- sideways curve Risus sardonicus- fixed grin: Treatment Immediate Care: Place in a dark, quiet room. Anesthesia: Chloroform or intravenous barbiturate if spasms allow. Adsorption: Administer animal charcoal to absorb free strychnine, or tannic acid if charcoal is unavailable. Antidotes: Intravenous barbiturates to stop convulsions. Muscle relaxants: Mephenesin, intravenous diazepam for anticonvulsant effects. Autopsy Findings Rigor mortis: Sets in almost immediately and passes off early. Stomach contents: Remains of seeds may be found. Delayed putrefaction. Toxicological analysis: Strychnine can be detected in putrefied bodies and viscera; brain and spinal cord should be preserved for analysis. Incorrect Options: Ricinus (Option B): Ricinus, derived from the castor bean plant, contains ricin, which causes gastrointestinal symptoms, organ failure, and hemorrhagic shock. It does not typically cause seizures with back arching. Nerium odorum (Option C): Nerium odorum (oleander) contains cardiac glycosides, which primarily affect the heart and can cause symptoms like nausea, vomiting, arrhythmias, and potentially death. Seizures and back arching are not characteristic features of oleander poisoning. Datura (Option D): Datura contains tropane alkaloids, which cause delirium, hallucinations, and anticholinergic toxicity. Although it can cause seizures, it is not typically associated with arching of the back or the pattern of seizures described here.",

        "D": "Yellow oleander, Physostigmine"
      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: B) Datura, Physostigmine Explanation The patient's symptoms suggest anticholinergic toxicity , likely due to the ingestion of Datura seeds. Physostigmine 1mg IV (hourly) is used as an antidote for datura poisoning. Datura contains hyoscine (scopolamine), hyoscyamine and traces of atropine Mechanism of Action: Initially, it stimulates the higher centers of the brain and then activates the motor centers. Later, it leads to depression of the vital centers in the medulla, resulting in paralysis. Clinical features: Dryness of mouth and throat Dysphagia Difficulty in talking Hoarseness of voice Flushed face Pupil dilatation Photophobia + Diplopia Agitation and restlessness Delirium Urinary retention Dry and hot skin Exfoliation of skin may occur Patients can end up in a coma, or death can occur due to respiratory paralysis. Treatment Gastrointestinal decontamination: Administer activated charcoal to absorb toxins. Use a cathartic if indicated. Antidote: Administer Physostigmine 1-2 mg IV slowl y, repeating as necessary based on symptom response. Symptomatic treatment: Consider Pilocarpine 5 mg subcutaneously for severe anticholinergic effects. Supportive care: Monitor vital signs and address any respiratory or cardiovascular issues. Pralidoxime is an antidote for organophosphate poisoning (which inhibits acetylcholinesterase), but it is not effective in treating anticholinergic poisoning caused by Datura or yellow oleander. It works by reactivating acetylcholinesterase that has been inhibited by organophosphates. (Option A & C ruled out) Yellow oleander poisoning is due to cardiac glycosides and can cause symptoms such as vomiting, arrhythmias, and confusion. The treatment for yellow oleander poisoning is Digoxin-specific antibody or anti-digoxin antibody therapy, or the use of potassium correction and Lidocaine for arrhythmias. (Option C & D ruled out)",

      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Correct answer: B) Corrosive poison Explanation: Corrosive poison has the maximum damage potential among the listed types due to its rapid and extensive destruction of tissues upon contact. Corrosive poisons (such as strong acids and alkalis) cause immediate and extensive tissue destruction upon contact, leading to severe burns, perforation of the gastrointestinal tract, shock, and potentially rapid death. Their effects are both local (at the site of contact) and systemic due to rapid absorption of toxic byproducts. Irritant poison (Option A): Causes inflammation of mucous membranes (e.g., GI tract), leading to vomiting, diarrhoea, and abdominal pain. Damage is usually localized and less severe than corrosives. Alcohol (Option C): Causes CNS depression , hypoglycaemia, respiratory depression, and liver damage with chronic use. Not as acutely destructive as corrosives. Opioid (Option D): Acts on central opioid receptors , causing respiratory depression and CNS effects. Lethal if untreated, but damage is reversible with prompt treatment (e.g., naloxone).

      },
      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "wolfsbane, is a highly toxic plant. It contains various alkaloids, including aconitine, which is responsible for its poisonous properties. The incorrect statement in this case is that only the roots of the plant are poisonous. In reality, all parts of the aconite plant are considered poisonous, including the roots, stems, leaves, and flowers. The plant contains toxic alkaloids throughout its structure, not just in the roots. Therefore, it is important to exercise caution and avoid direct contact or ingestion of any part of the aconite plant. Incorrect Options: Option B - Causes AV block: Aconite is known to have potent cardiac effects. It can cause significant cardiac toxicity, including cardiac arrhythmias and disturbances in conduction, such as AV block. These effects are attributed to the toxic alkaloids present in the plant, particularly aconitine. Therefore, it is correct to state that aconite can cause AV block. Option C - Atropine is not specific for aconite poisoning: In cases of aconite poisoning, the primary treatment is supportive care and immediate medical attention. Activated charcoal may be administered to help prevent absorption of the toxin. Additionally, supportive measures such as cardiac monitoring, intravenous fluids, and management of arrhythmias may be necessary. Atropine is not specific for aconite poisoning and may not effectively counteract the toxic effects of aconite alkaloids.

        "C": "Anemic hypoxia",
        "D": "All of the above"
      },
      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "death. Anemic hypoxia occurs when there is a reduced oxygen-carrying capacity of the blood. In the case of smoke inhalation, the inhaled smoke can contain toxic substances such as carbon monoxide (CO) and hydrogen cyanide (HCN). These substances can interfere with the normal binding of oxygen to hemoglobin in red blood cells, resulting in reduced oxygen transport throughout the body. Carbon monoxide (CO) is particularly problematic as it has a strong affinity for hemoglobin and forms carboxyhemoglobin, which prevents the binding of oxygen. Hydrogen cyanide (HCN) interferes with cellular respiration and inhibits the utilization of oxygen by cells. Incorrect Options: Option A - Histotoxic hypoxia : Histotoxic hypoxia refers to the inability of the body tissues to effectively use oxygen, even when an adequate amount of oxygen is available. It typically occurs due to the impairment of cellular metabolism or function, such as in cases of certain drug overdoses. Histotoxic hypoxia is not the primary cause of death in smoke inhalation. Option B - Ischemic hypoxia : Ischemic hypoxia is caused by a reduced blood supply to tissues, resulting in insufficient oxygen delivery. It can occur due to conditions like cardiac arrest or severe blood loss. While smoke inhalation can lead to tissue damage and potential ischemia in specific cases, it is not the primary cause of death in smoke inhalation.

      },
      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "It works by blocking the action of certain receptors in the body, specifically the alpha-1 adrenergic receptors. In the case of scorpion envenomation, scorpion venom typically contains compounds that can stimulate the release of catecholamines, such as norepinephrine, leading to sympathetic overactivity. This can result in symptoms such as hypertension and increased heart rate. By blocking the alpha-1 adrenergic receptors, prazosin helps to counteract the effects of the excessive sympathetic stimulation caused by scorpion venom. It helps to relax smooth muscles in blood vessels, reducing blood pressure and improving symptoms associated with scorpion envenomation. Incorrect Options: Option A - Physostigmine: Physostigmine is a medication that acts as an acetylcholinesterase inhibitor, increasing the availability of acetylcholine in the body. While it can be used as an antidote for certain types of poisoning, such as anticholinergic toxicity, it is not typically used as a specific antidote for scorpion venom. Option B - Norepinephrine: Norepinephrine is a naturally occurring neurotransmitter and hormone that is involved in the sympathetic nervous system response. While norepinephrine might be elevated in scorpion envenomation, it is not considered a specific physiological antidote to scorpion venom. Option D - Atropine: Atropine is an anticholinergic medication that blocks the action of acetylcholine in the body. It is commonly used to counteract the effects of excessive acetylcholine stimulation. However, in the case of scorpion envenomation, the primary issue is excessive sympathetic activity rather than excessive cholinergic activity. Therefore, atropine is not the preferred physiological antidote for scorpion venom. Reference: Prepladder Notes",

The procedure involves introducing a tube into the stomach to wash out the toxic substance and reduce its absorption into the body. Gastric lavage is considered beneficial in removing any remaining carbolic acid from the stomach and can be an important part of the treatment protocol for carbolic acid poisoning. Incorrect Options: Option A - Sulphuric acid: Sulphuric acid is a highly corrosive and dangerous substance. In cases of sulphuric acid poisoning, gastric lavage is generally not recommended as it may cause further damage to the gastrointestinal tract. Immediate medical attention and appropriate management are crucial in cases of sulphuric acid poisoning to minimize harm and provide necessary treatment. Option B - Strychnine: Strychnine is a highly toxic alkaloid that affects the nervous system. Gastric lavage is typically not performed in cases of strychnine poisoning. The primary focus of treatment for strychnine poisoning involves managing symptoms, such as muscle spasms and seizures, providing supportive care, and administering specific antidotes as appropriate.

Additionally, the pink color of mucosa and skin appears because of the excessive infectious hemoglobin saturation. Symptoms of HCN poisoning: Difficulty breathing or shortness of breath Rapid and shallow breathing Rapid heart rate (tachycardia) Chest pain or tightness Dizziness or lightheadedness Headache Confusion or disorientation Seizures or convulsions Loss of consciousness Nausea and vomiting Abdominal pain or cramps Skin discoloration (bluish appearance) Eye irritation or redness (if exposed to HCN gas) Cyanide-like odor (bitter almond odor) may be present in some cases Treatment: Activated charcoal to absorb the toxin. In severe cases, Cyanokit, hydroxocobalamin, and Eli lilly's antidote Incorrect Options: Option A - H 2 S poisoning: H2S poisoning is also a severe and fatal condition. The primary symptoms of this condition are headaches, tremors, nausea, delirium, convulsions, disturbed equilibrium, eye and skin irritation, rapid unconsciousness, and eventually death. Option B - CO poisoning: CO poisoning can also be deadly. The most common signs of CO poisoning are vomiting, upset stomach, dizziness, headache, chest pain, and confusion. If anyone inhales excessive CO, it has the potential to kill that individual. Option D - OPC poisoning: OPC poisoning is a known class of insecticides that occurs when a person is exposed to organophosphates. The condition's primary symptoms are a runny nose, glassy eyes, blurry vision, agitation, muscle weakness, narrowed pill, etc. In severe cases, it leads to coma or collapse.

        "A": "Alcohol poisoning",
        "B": "Opioid poisoning",
        "C": "Organophosphorus poisoning",
        "D": "Datura poisoning"
      },
      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "after respiratory, oral, or dermal exposure to nerve agents or organophosphorus pesticides. The onset symptoms of this specific disease are excessive lacrimation and saliva production, tiny pupils(miosis) , vomiting, diarrhea, excessive sweating, confusion, etc. So, as farmers are experiencing pinpoint pupils and increased secretion, the diagnosis is organophosphorus poisoning. The primary treatment of Organophosphorus poisoning in emergency cases is stabilization . The experts will stabilize the breathing, decontaminate the body to stop further exposure and use intravenous fluids to clear the system from the toxins. But, in non-emergency cases , the healthcare provider will give supportive therapy and stabilize the breathing using atropine (drug). Incorrect Options: Option A - Alcohol poisoning: Alcohol poisoning is a severe and deadly condition. It quickly affects heart rate, breathing, gag reflex, and body temperature. So, it often leads to coma and even death. Option B - Opioid poisoning: Opioid poisoning occurs when there is excessive stimulation on the pathway of opiate. It eventually leads to lower respiratory effort and death. It can also cause pinpoint pupils but there is no increased body secretions. Option D: Datura poisoning: Datura poisoning after 60 minutes of ingestion. The symptoms are dry skin and mouth, respiratory arrest, urinary retention, delirium, and tachycardia.

Atropine is a naturally occurring substance found in certain plants, colchicine is a toxic alkaloid found in the autumn crocus plant, and curare refers to a group of natural toxins obtained from South American plants. Arsenic, on the other hand, is not classified as a toxin, but rather as a toxic element. Incorrect Options: Option A - All are correct: This option is incorrect because arsenic is not considered a toxin. Option C -1, 3 are correct: This option is incorrect because it fails to include colchicine (option 2), which is indeed a toxin. Option D - 3, 4 are correct: This option is incorrect because it includes arsenic (option 4), which is not a toxin Reference: Prepladder Notes",

      "question": "A 28 year old man presented with dry mouth, urinary retention, and constipation after consuming an unknown substance. On examination, his PR 110 bpm, and his pupils were dilated. What did he most likely consume?",
      "options": {
        "A": "Heroin",
        "B": "Morphine",
        "C": "Malathion",
        "D": "Belladona"
      },
      "correct_answer": "D",
      "explanation": "alkaloids such as atropine and scopolamine. These substances are known to cause anticholinergic effects, which include dry mouth, urinary retention, constipation, increased heart rate (tachycardia), and dilated pupils (mydriasis). Incorrect Options: Option A - Heroin : Heroin is an opioid drug that acts on opioid receptors in the central nervous system. While opioids like heroin can cause respiratory depression, they typically do not produce significant anticholinergic effects. Common effects of heroin use include euphoria, drowsiness, pinpoint pupils (miosis), respiratory depression, and constipation. Dry mouth, urinary retention, and dilated pupils are not typical symptoms associated with heroin use. Option B - Morphine: Morphine is another opioid drug with similar effects to heroin. Like heroin, morphine primarily acts on opioid receptors and can cause respiratory depression and constipation. However, it does not typically produce pronounced anticholinergic effects such as dry mouth, urinary retention, and dilated pupils. Option C - Malathion : Malathion is an organophosphate insecticide. Ingestion of malathion can lead to symptoms such as excessive salivation, sweating, and constricted pupils (miosis), rather than the anticholinergic effects described in the case.

      },
      "correct_answer": "D",
      "explanation": "depression, bradycardia, and pinpoint pupils. Incorrect Options: Option A - Benzodiazepine overdose: Benzodiazepines are central nervous system depressants that can cause respiratory depression, hypotension, and decreased level of consciousness. However, benzodiazepine overdose is less likely to cause bradycardia and pinpoint pupils. The patient's presentation is more consistent with opioid intoxication. Option B - Cocaine intoxication: Cocaine is a stimulant drug that can cause tachycardia, hypertension, hyperthermia, dilated pupils, and agitation. The patient's presentation is inconsistent with cocaine intoxication. Cocaine use is more likely to cause hyperthermia, tachycardia, and dilated pupils, rather than hypothermia, bradycardia, and pinpoint pupils. Option C - Opioid withdrawal: Opioid withdrawal is characterized by symptoms such as sweating, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, dilated pupils, and agitation. The patient's presentation is inconsistent with opioid withdrawal. Opioid withdrawal is more likely to cause tachycardia, rather than bradycardia, and elevated respiratory rate, rather than decreased respiratory rate. Reference: Prepladder Notes",

      "question": "A 23-year-old farm worker from a remote village was brought to the hospital 8 hours later, following a snake bite at 5 in the morning. The patient complained of headache, blurred vision, tingling sensation around the mouth, dizziness and vertigo and had multiple episodes of vomiting since the bite. He has signs of respiratory depression and bradycardia (HR<50) . The local wound showed mild swelling and blistering. There are no apparent bleeding manifestations. He was administered 10 vials of antivenom. Which of the following is the subsequent step of management?",
      "options": {
        "A": "Check the blood coagulation profile",
        "B": "Neostigmine with atropine",
        "C": "Epinephrine injection",
        "D": "I.V hydrocortisone"
      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "with snakebite envenomation would be Neostigmine with Atropine. The symptoms described suggest that the patient may be experiencing neurotoxic effects of the snake venom, which can cause respiratory depression, bradycardia, and other neurological symptoms. Antivenom is an important component of snakebite treatment, but it may not reverse the neurological effects of the venom, which can persist even after neutralization of the venom's systemic effects. Neostigmine with Atropine is a treatment option for such cases of neurotoxicity, as it can help to reverse neuromuscular paralysis caused by snake venom. Incorrect Options: Option A - Check the blood coagulation profile: Checking the blood coagulation profile may be necessary in cases of snakebite envenomation caused by venom that can cause coagulopathy. However, in this case, there are no apparent bleeding manifestations described Option C - Epinephrine injection: Epinephrine injection is not indicated for this patient because the symptoms described are not consistent with anaphylaxis, which is the primary indication for epinephrine administration. Option D - I.V hydrocortisone: I.V hydrocortisone is not indicated for this patient because it is not effective in treating the neurotoxic effects of snake venom. Reference: Prepladder Notes",

      "explanation": "of hematological abnormalities, including anemia, basophilic stippling, and the presence of nucleated red blood cells (RBCs) in the peripheral blood. In severe cases, lead poisoning can also lead to bone marrow suppression, which can result in pancytopenia. However, it is important to note that the hematological picture of lead poisoning can vary depending on the level and duration of exposure, as well as individual factors such as age and nutritional status. Incorrect Options: Option A - Minamata disease : While it is possible that mercury toxicity may lead to some degree of hematological abnormalities, such as anemia, the typical hematological picture of Minamata disease does not include specific features that would clearly distinguish it from other causes of anemia. Option C - Chronic iron toxicity: Chronic iron toxicity can lead to a hematological picture of microcytic hypochromic anemia, which is characterized by small red blood cells that contain insufficient hemoglobin. While this is a specific hematological feature that can be seen in chronic iron toxicity, it is not unique to this condition and can also occur in other forms of anemia. Option D - Arsenic poisoning: Arsenic poisoning can lead to a variety of hematological abnormalities, including anemia, leukopenia, and thrombocytopenia. The specific hematological picture may vary depending on the severity and duration of exposure. However, the presence of anemia alone is not specific enough to diagnose arsenic poisoning, as anemia can also occur in many other conditions.",
