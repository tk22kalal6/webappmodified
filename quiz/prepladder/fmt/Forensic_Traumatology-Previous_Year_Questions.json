      "explanation": "depressed fracture, where the bone is pushed inward at the point of impact, creating a localized depression or indentation. Depressed Fracture Comminuted Fracture Gutter Fracture Occurs when a fragment of the skull is pushed inward towards the brain. Caused by blows from heavy objects with a small surface (e.g., hammers, bricks). The shape of the depressed area may resemble the object that caused the injury. Variants: Elevated Fracture : One end of the fractured fragment is raised above the skull, while the other is pushed inward. Caused by sharp objects like an axe. Pond Fracture : Seen in infants, this smooth depression occurs without a fracture line, resembling a dent in a ping-pong ball. Caused by obstetrics forceps blade. Involves multiple intersecting fracture lines, breaking the bone into several fragments. Caused by high-impact trauma (e.g., vehicular accidents, crushing injuries). It may occur alongside other fractures (e.g., fissured or depressed fractures). Spider web-like patterns on an X-ray are characteristic of comminuted fractures. In severe cases, bone fragments may penetrate the brain or become displaced. A groove or channel is formed in the skull bone, often due to an oblique bullet wound. Frequently associated with comminuted and depressed fractures of the inner skull table. Bone fragments can cause injury to the meninges or brain. Depressed fracture Comminuted fracture Gutter fracture Ring Fracture (Option D) Motorcyclist Fracture (Hinge Fracture) (Option C) Encircles the foramen magnum at the skull base. Runs from the sella turcica to the petrous ridges and posterior fossa. It can extend to the middle ear and roof of the nose. Transverse fracture at the skull base, splitting it and creating a \"hinge\" - nodding face sign . It extends from one petrous ridge across the sella turcica to the other petrous ridge. Caused by: Falls landing on feet/buttocks (force transmitted through the spine). Heavy blows to the top of the skull/ vertex. Twisting of the head on the spine. Blows to the occiput or chin. Often caused by side impacts . Ring fracture Hinge fracture Fissured Fracture (Linear Fracture) (Option A) Diastatic Fracture (Sutural Fracture) The most common skull fracture accounts for about 70% of cases. Linear cracks may involve the vertex or skull base. It can affect the full thickness of the bone or just the inner/outer layers. The fracture line is irregular and fine, sometimes hard to detect on X-rays. It runs parallel to the compressive force. No depression of bone fragments. Involves the separation of cranial sutures. More common in children. Often occurs with other skull fractures, especially fissured fractures. Commonly seen at the sagittal suture. Causes: Impact against broad surfaces (e.g., falls or road traffic accidents) Falls on feet or buttocks, transmitting force upwards. Causes: Blunt trauma to the head. Increased intracranial pressure leads to suture separation. Narrow fissure skull fracture Diastatic Fracture",

      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: C) Laceration Explanation: The above image and scenario are suggestive of a laceration Laceration is the tearing or splitting of the skin, mucous membranes, muscles, or internal organs due to a shearing or crushing force from a blunt impact over a broad area. When blunt force causes severe bruising and damage to deeper tissues, it is referred to as a crush injury . Characteristics Irregular Margins : Ragged, uneven edges with pointed or blunt ends, often showing small tears. Swallow Tails : Tearing at the ends of lacerations, diverging. Bruising : Seen around the wound, more pronounced in areas impacted at an angle or with downward force. Tissue Bridges : Deeper tissues are unevenly torn, leaving nerve, vessel, and connective tissue bridges. Hair Damage : Crushed hair bulbs; hair and skin tags may be embedded in the wound. Hemorrhage : Less severe bleeding as arteries are crushed and torn irregularly , retracting and allowing blood to clot . Soiling : Debris like mud, wood splinters, sand, glass, or hair can become embedded, carrying medico-legal significance. Wound Gaping : Impact from an angle causes tearing on the opposite side and abrasion on the impact side, leading to gaping. Incorrect Options: Incised wounds (Option A): They have clean, smooth edges and do not show the uneven tearing or bruising present in this case. Abrasions (Option B): They involve superficial skin damage and typically lack deep tissue involvement and significant bruising. Bruise (Option D): A bruise (contusion) is caused by blunt trauma, leading to subcutaneous bleeding without a break in the skin.",

      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: B) Chop wound Explanation: The injury from the scenario is suggestive of a chop wound. A chop wound is a deep injury caused by a heavy, sharp object like an axe. It combines features of both an incised wound (sharp edges) and a lacerated wound (underlying tissue damage and crushing effect). Chop wounds/ Slash wounds These are deep gaping wounds inflicted by a blow with the moderately sharp cutting edge of a heavy weapon when applied with significant force. It is a combination of blunt and sharp force injury. Weapons used Hatchet Axe Sword Broad heavy knife Chopper Saber Meat cleaver Features of the wound The axe's lower end (heel) strikes first, leaving a deeper wound than the upper end (toe). It is an incised wound on skin with an underlying communited fracture or deep grove in the bone. Dimensions of the wound correspond to the cross-section of the penetrating blade. Margins are sharp and may have abrasions, bruising, and some lacerations with severe injury to underlying organs. Medicolegal importance Most injuries are homicidal. Frew are accidental by machinery (propeller injuries). Rarely suicidal. Wounds give details of the weapon used and the direction of attack. Chop wound on forehead from a propeller accident Incorrect Options: Incised wound (Option A): An incised wound is caused by a sharp-edged object, such as a knife or blade, and is characterized by clean-cut edges. Lacerated wound (Option C): Lacerated wounds are caused by blunt force trauma, resulting in irregular edges. An axe typically causes more defined sharp edges, making it a chop wound rather than a laceration. Abrasion (Option D): Abrasions are superficial injuries caused by friction or scraping against a rough surface, which is not applicable in the case of an axe assault.",

      "correct_answer": "D",
      "explanation": "shown in the image would be Incised-looking laceration. Split lacerations are commonly seen in areas where the skin is close to bone, such as the scalp, with minimal underlying soft tissue. Although the edges may appear sharp, the presence of tissue bridges confirms the diagnosis of a laceration rather than an incised wound. Types of Laceration Split laceration Avulsion laceration Stretch laceration Tear laceration Cut laceration Types of Laceration Split Laceration (Incised looking laceration) These occur when skin is crushed between two objects, such as the scalp being compressed between the skull and a hard surface like the ground or a blunt object. Seen on areas where the skin is close to bone, with minimal underlying tissue E.g., scalp, eyebrows, cheekbones, jaw, iliac crest, perineum, shin. Lacerations without excessive skin crushing can have sharp edges, resembling incised wounds. Also known as incised looking laceration. These are not undermined and show tissue bridges. Avulsion (Shearing Laceration) Caused by a shearing force at an acute angle, detaching skin or organs from their attachments. The shearing and grinding force from a heavy object, like a lorry wheel passing over a limb, can cause the skin to separate from the underlying tissues, a condition known as avulsion or \"flaying.\" This often results in crushed muscles and fractured bones. The detached skin may have extensive abrasions due to the tyre’s",

A Hinge fracture involves a break in the skull that allows part of the skull to rotate or pivot around a point, resembling a hinge. This type of fracture typically occurs due to a localized impact or force, often affecting the base or side of the skull. Motorcyclist Fracture (Hinge Fracture) (Option B) Ring Fracture (Option D ruled out) Transverse fracture at the skull base, splitting it and creating a \"hinge\" - nodding face sign . It extends from one petrous ridge across the sella turcica to the other petrous ridge. Encircles the foramen magnum at the skull base.

      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: A) Abrasion Explanation: Abrasion: Abrasion is a superficial injury caused by the removal or damage of the skin's outer layer (epidermis) due to friction or pressure. It is classified into four main types: Scratch Abrasion (Linear Abrasion) Grazed Abrasion (Sliding Abrasion) Mechanism: Caused by tangential (side-to-side) force, producing a long and narrow abrasion. Features: Linear in nature, with length being more significant than width. Examples: Fingernail abrasion, thorn abrasion, and pin abrasion. Mechanism: Occurs when skin slides over a rough surface, resulting in superficial scrapes. Also Known As: Grinding abrasion, gravel rash, brush-burn. Features: Seen in road traffic accidents or falls, especially on exposed areas like knees or elbows. Imprint Abrasion (Patterned Abrasion) Pressure Abrasion (Crushing Abrasion) Mechanism: Results from compressive force applied perpendicular to the skin, leaving a distinct pattern of the object. Also Known As Impact abrasion, contact abrasion, patterned abrasion. Examples: Tyre marks, bite marks Mechanism: Caused by a continuous vertical force applied to the skin, crushing the epidermis. Features: Deeper skin injuries are often seen",

        "C": "Hypothermia",
        "D": "LSD overdose"
      },
      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: C) Hypothermia Explanation: Hypothermia occurs when the body's core temperature falls below 36°C (96.8°F), leading to paradoxical undressing . This occurs due to disorientation and mental confusion as the body struggles to regulate temperature, causing the victim to undress, which paradoxically increases heat loss. This behavior can be mistaken for evidence of sexual assault or homicide . Hypothermia Definition Core temperature below 36°C (96.8°F) Signs Disorientation Dulling of consciousness Loss of reflex Fall in respiration, heart rate, and blood pressure Red patches and pallor of the skin Edema of the face Stiffness of neck muscles Autopsy findings Patches of pink to brownish-pink discoloration Postmortem staining: Pink/bright red Cyanosis or pallor in extremities (\"white deaths\") Edema of feet and blistering of skin Stomach: Wischnewsky spots- brownish black colored gastric mucosal ulcers Viscera-congested, hemorrhagic Phenomena seen in hypothermia victims Paradoxical undressing - found undressed due to disorientation which increases heat loss (mistaken for evidence of sexual assault or homicide) ‘Hide and die' syndrome - found in unusual locations resembling an attempt to \"hide\" or create a protective environment due to mental confusion and a possible hibernation reflex (confused with signs of homicide or robbery) Chilblain (Erythema Pernio) - red, itching skin lesions typically found on extremities due to cold exposure, often accompanied by edema and blistering. Heart stress (Option A) typically refers to conditions that put pressure on the heart, such as heart attacks or heart failure. Paradoxical undressing is not associated with heart stress. It occurs due to hypothermia, where the body loses its ability to regulate temperature properly. Voyeurism (Option B) is a psychological condition where individuals gain sexual pleasure from watching others without their knowledge. It is unrelated to paradoxical undressing, which is a phenomenon occurring due to hypothermia and confusion. LSD overdose (Option D) can cause severe confusion, hallucinations, and altered perceptions, but it does not typically lead to paradoxical undressing. Hypothermia, not LSD overdose, is the primary cause of this phenomenon. Reference: Gautam Biswas Review of Forensic Medicine and Toxicology, 3rd edition, pages 263-264",

      "explanation": "the fatal injury. These small cuts can be indicative of hesitation , often observed in scenarios of self-infliction or in cases where the victim may have struggled before the lethal wound. Hesitation cuts: Hesitation cuts (also known as tentative cuts or trial wounds) are multiple, small, superficial cuts that typically involve only the skin. These cuts are often found at the beginning of a deeper incised wound. Psychological Aspect : They suggest that the individual may have hesitated while gathering the courage to make a decisive cut. Forensic Observation : In cases of homicidal sharp force injuries, multiple superficial, roughly parallel incised wounds may appear on the neck, often adjacent to a single deep, lethal incised wound, particularly in instances where torture is involved. Grazed abrasion (Option B): Superficial injury caused by a tangential force, resulting in skin being scraped off. Commonly occurs during falls or friction injuries. Laceration (Option C): Irregular tear in the skin caused by blunt force trauma, often accompanied by tissue bridging. Patterned bruise (Option D): Bruises that replicate the shape of the causative object (e.g., belt marks or shoe prints). Seen in cases of physical assault or trauma.

        "B": "Abrasion",
        "C": "Laceration",
        "D": "Stab wound"
      },
      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: A) Contusion Explanation A contusion, commonly known as a bruise, results from blunt force trauma causing blood vessels under the skin to rupture. It appears as discoloration of the skin due to subcutaneous bleeding without an open wound. The image likely shows this characteristic discoloration. Abrasion (Option B): An abrasion involves superficial damage to the skin, such as scraping, which removes the epidermis. It does not typically involve subcutaneous bleeding as seen in the image. Laceration (Option C): Lacerations are irregular tears in the skin caused by blunt or sharp trauma. They are characterized by jagged wound edges, which are not visible in the provided image. Stab wound (Option D): A stab wound is caused by a pointed object penetrating the skin. It is characterized by a deep, narrow wound, which is inconsistent with the image. Mechanism of injury of contusions A contusion or bruise is a leak of blood into the tissues due to the rupture of blood vessels (veins, venules, arterioles) caused due to injury by a blunt object. Some blunt objects that can cause contusions are fist, stones, sticks, bar, whip, hammer, axe, wooden handle, poker, foot with shoe or boot, etc. Factors influencing the formation of bruises Condition and type of tissues Vascular and loose tissues may form large bruises even with a small degree of violence. Examples: face, vulva, and scrotum. Firm fibrous tissues, strongly supported tissues, and those covered by a thick dermis produce a comparatively small bruise for moderate trauma. Examples: abdomen, back, scalp, palms, and soles. Injury of tissues over bony surfaces shows prominent bruising. Age Children bruise easily. Older people bruise easily. Gender Women bruise more easily than men. Obese people bruise easily due to the high volume of subcutaneous tissue. Colour of the skin Bruising is more easily visible in fair-skinned people than in dark-skinned people. Contusions are better felt in dark-skinned people than seen. Natural diseases Prominent bruising is seen with minor trauma in patients with: Arteriosclerosis Whooping cough in children due to violent coughing can cause bruising Purpura hemorrhagica Leukemia Hemophilia Scurvy Vitamin K Prothrombin deficiency Phosphorus poisoning Older persons on systemic steroids Gravity shifting of the blood In deep bruises, blood tracks along the fascial planes and may cause the bruise at a different site. This is called ectopic bruising or percolated or migratory contusion . Examples: Spectacle hematoma or black eye in blunt trauma to the forehead. Bruise behind ear due to basal skull fracture ( Battle’s sign ). Bruise in the neck from fracture of the jaw. Bruise around the ankle from a kick on the calf. Learning Objective:",

      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: C) Ligature mark Explanation A ligature mark is pressure abrasion caused by the application of a constricting force using a cord-like object (e.g., rope, wire) around the neck. It is commonly observed in cases of hanging or strangulation. Characteristics include a continuous or interrupted band-like mark, which may show the texture or pattern of the ligature material. The location and orientation of the mark can help distinguish hanging from manual strangulation. Pressure abrasion (Option A): Caused by sustained pressure of a blunt object against the skin. Graze abrasion (Option B): Occurs when the skin is scraped against a rough surface.

Chop/ Slash wound Deep, gaping wounds caused by a blow from a sharp-cutting edge of a heavy weapon (e.g., hatchet, axe, sword, chopper). Wound size corresponds to the cross-section of the blade. Undermining occurs in the direction of chop . The heel (lower end) of the axe typically strikes first , leading to deeper wounds than the toe (upper end). The deeper end indicates the assailant's position . Clean slicing through bone at impact; rebound can create irregular fragments; may lead to complete or incomplete amputations. Mostly homicidal injuries to exposed body parts (head, face, neck, extremities) Incorrect Options: Contusion (Option A): Contusions (bruises) are commonly observed in RTAs due to blunt force trauma sustained during the impact or collision. Abrasions (Option B): Abrasions are also frequent in RTAs, resulting from friction or scraping of the skin against rough surfaces, such as the road or vehicle parts. Laceration (Option C): Lacerations, or irregular tears in the skin, are often seen in RTAs, especially in cases involving glass shards, sharp edges of vehicles, or other objects.

These wounds typically occur on the flexor surface of the forearm, as individuals instinctively raise their arms to protect their face and body during an attack. The cuts on the victim's arm in this scenario are consistent with defense wounds, suggesting that the victim was trying to shield themselves from harm. Incorrect Options: Option B - Self-inflicted injury: Self-inflicted injuries are wounds that a person intentionally inflicts upon themselves. These injuries might result from self-harm or suicide attempts. However, in the given scenario, the presence of multiple cuts on the victim's arm does not necessarily suggest self-inflicted injury, as the location and pattern of the cuts seem more indicative of defensive actions rather than self-infliction. Option C - Accidental cut wound from falling: An accidental cut wound from falling might result from an individual accidentally coming into contact with a sharp object while falling. However, this scenario is less likely in this case because the presence of multiple cuts on the flexor surface of the arm is not consistent with typical patterns of injuries sustained during a fall. Option D - Washer-women hands: \"Washer-women hands\" is a term used to describe the appearance of the fingers and hands after prolonged exposure to water, like during laundry work. This option is not relevant to the scenario described, as it does not explain the presence of multiple cuts on the victim's arm or the context of the drowning incident. Reference: .",

      "explanation": "tissues or body cavities. In this case, the stab wound to the anterior thigh involves a sharp object penetrating the skin and underlying tissues, making it a penetrating wound. Stab wound/Punctured wound These are inflicted by penetration with long, narrow instruments having pointed (sometimes blunt) ends into the depth of the body, which is deeper than its length and width. Weapons used Knife (most common) Pieces of glass (broken glass bottle) Scissors Screwdrivers Pens Ice picks Forks Types of stab wounds Puncture wound: (Option C) Soft tissues are involved Penetrating wound: Enters a body cavity or a viscus Perforating wound: Through-and-through puncture wounds The weapon enters the body from one side and comes out the other The wound of entry is larger than the exit Significance of the wound dimensions Length is slightly less than the width of the weapon due to the stretching of the skin. Breadth is more than the thickness of weapon due to gaping. Depth , the greatest dimension of the wound, corresponds to the length of the weapon's blade, which has completely entered the body without perforation. Margins or edges of the wound are clean cut with usually no abrasion or bruising. Margins by a pointed or conical weapon have lacerated edges If the hilt guard of the weapon strikes the skin, a regular, sharp, and well-defined patterned abrasion or bruising is formed Incised wound (Option A): An incised wound is a clean cut caused by a sharp object (e.g., a razor or knife) and is typically longer than it is deep. A stab wound is deeper than it is long, so it does not qualify as an incised wound. Blunt force injury (Option D): This involves trauma caused by a blunt object (e.g., a bat or hammer) and does not involve penetration of the skin or tissues. A stab wound is caused by a sharp object, not blunt force.",

        "B": "40-44%",
        "C": "18-20%",
        "D": "5-10%"
      },
      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: A) 25-30% Explanation: In children, the total body surface area (TBSA) percentages differ from adults due to the larger head-to-body ratio. According to the Rule of Nines adjusted for children and the Lund and Browder chart: The entire head and neck account for approximately 18% of the TBSA in a 3-year-old child. Each upper limb accounts for approximately 9% of the TBSA. Adding these together: 18% (head and neck) + 9% (one upper limb) = 27% According to the Wallace rule of 9, this is how the area burned is calculated: Adults Children Infants Head & neck 9% 18% 20% Front of chest & abdominal wall 9 x 2 = 18% 18% 10 x 2 = 20% Back of chest & abdominal wall 9 x 2 = 18% 18% 10 x 2 = 20% Lower limb 18 x 2 = 36% 13.5 x 2 = 27% 10 x 2 = 20% Upper limb 9 x 2 = 18% 18% 10 x 2 = 20% Perineum 1% 1% 40-44% (Option B): This value overestimates the burn area. A 40-44% burn would imply involvement of larger or additional body areas beyond the head, neck, and one upper limb, such as parts of the trunk or both upper limbs. 18-20% (Option C): This value roughly corresponds to the head and neck alone, without including the upper limb. Since the upper limb is also involved, the percentage should be higher. 5-10% (Option D): This severely underestimates the burn size. The entire head and neck alone exceed 10%, so including one upper limb must be substantially more. Reference: SRB 6th edition, page 122",

These signs are typically seen when the muzzle is relatively close to the target, usually within a few feet. Incorrect Options: Option A - Distant range: At a distant range, the wound would not exhibit blackening or tattooing because the gunpowder residues would not have had a chance to settle on the skin. Distant range wounds usually present with a clean entry wound without additional residues. Option B - Close contact: Close contact wounds are typically characterized by a much more severe pattern, such as a star-shaped wound with burning and possibly charring of the skin. The presence of blackening and tattooing suggests a somewhat less extreme range, but still close. Option D - Cannot be predicted: The presence of blackening and tattooing can indeed predict the bullet range with a reasonable degree of certainty. Therefore, this option is not accurate as the gunshot range can be estimated based on these features.",

      "explanation": "refers to the diameter of a rifled firearm's barrel, specifically measured between opposing lands. This measurement, typically expressed in inches or millimetres, is crucial for linking a bullet to a specific firearm. Rifled Firearms: Rifled firearms have a bore characterised by a series of grooves that spiral along the barrel's length. These grooves (Option B) , known as \"rifling,\" alternate with raised areas called \"lands.\" The caliber is determined by measuring the distance between these lands. (Option A) The direction of rifling can be either right (clockwise) or left (counter-clockwise), with most handguns featuring a right-hand twist. As the bullet travels through the barrel, it engages with the lands and grooves, imparting a spin that stabilises its flight and leaves distinctive markings on the bullet, which serve as identifiers for the firearm. Number of lead pellets (Option C) Bore or Gauge: It is used for smooth bore weapons. The number of balls/pellets of equal size/weight made from 1 pound lead (454g) 12 bore = 12 balls Mass and velocity (Option D) of a projectile fired from a rifled barrel weapon are important factors in its performance, they are not used directly to determine the caliber of the weapon",

The gases and particles from the gunpowder can cause the surrounding skin to exhibit a stellate or star-shaped pattern due to the pressure and heat. Incorrect Options: Option A - Close shot: A close shot refers to a gunshot that is fired from a relatively short distance, usually within a few inches to a few feet. In a close shot, there might be stippling or soot deposition around the entrance wound, but the injury would not typically exhibit a stellate (star-shaped) appearance. Option C - Near shot: A near shot, also known as a close intermediate shot, refers to a gunshot fired from a short distance but not in direct contact with the skin. The range is usually a few inches to a few feet. This might result in stippling or powder tattooing around the entrance wound due to the impact of unburned gunpowder particles on the skin. However, it is less likely to produce a stellate wound pattern as seen in contact shots. Option D - Distant shot: A distant shot is fired from a considerable distance, and the effects on the body are determined by the range of fire. At a greater distance, the bullet's energy dissipates, and there may be no stippling or soot deposition around the entrance wound. The wound tends to be cleaner and smaller compared to closer shots.

      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "the underlying hair bulbs. It often results from blunt force trauma, which can cause compression and crushing of the hair bulbs . Crushed hair bulbs indicate a significant force applied to the area, consistent with a laceration. Characteristics of Lacerations: Trauma: Blunt trauma, may be heavy Damage: 3-Dimensional injury Margins: Irregular Floor: Vessels, nerve, and hair bulb are crushed. Structures: Epidermis +dermis + subcutaneous tissue. Swallow tail, tearing at the end, diverging. Tissue bridges and tissue fragments connect each other from the margin. Bleeding comparatively due to crushed blood vessels. Incorrect Options: Option A - Abrasions: Abrasions typically involve superficial damage to the skin without significant underlying tissue injury. They do not usually cause crushing of hair bulbs. Option C - Stab injuries: Stab injuries are caused by a pointed object piercing the skin.

These characteristics are due to the presence of unburned gunpowder particles and hot gasses discharged from the firearm. Incorrect Options: Option B - Close shot exit wound : In close shot exit wounds, the burning, blackening, and tattooing effects are usually not present. Close shot exit wounds are characterized by an irregular or stellate appearance, as the bullet exits the body and causes tissue disruption. Option C - Distant shot entry wound: In distant shot entry wounds, there is a significant distance between the muzzle of the firearm and the body. The effects of burning, blackening, and tattooing are not typically observed in such cases. Distant shot entry wounds may appear as small, circular or oval-shaped holes without the characteristics associated with close-range shots. Option D - Distant shot exit wound : Similar to distant shot entry wounds, distant shot exit wounds do not exhibit the effects of burning, blackening, and tattooing.

Primary markings include the lands and grooves on the inside of the barrel, which leave distinct striations on the bullet or cartridge case as it passes through the barrel. These primary markings are the key elements that make each firearm's tool marks unique. Secondary markings, may be present on a bullet or cartridge case due to factors such as the firing mechanism, extractor, or ejector of the firearm . When analyzing a bullet or cartridge case, forensic experts examine both the primary and secondary markings to compare them with test-fired bullets or cartridge cases from suspect firearms Incorrect Options: Option A - Primary markings: Primary markings alone do not encompass the complete analysis involved in bullet fingerprinting. Option B - Secondary markings: Secondary markings alone are also not sufficient for bullet fingerprinting analysis. Option D - None: None is incorrect because bullet fingerprinting does involve the examination of both primary and secondary markings. Reference: Prepladder Notes",
