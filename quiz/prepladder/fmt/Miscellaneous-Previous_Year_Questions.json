      "question": "'A' kills 'B' with a knife. Another person 'Z' saw 'A' with a knife in the park a few minutes before the murder. 'Z' gives this statement in a court of law. What kind of evidence is it?",
      "options": {
        "A": "Direct",
        "B": "Indirect",
        "C": "Hostile",
        "D": "Hearsay"
      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: B) Indirect Explanation Indirect evidence, also known as circumstantial evidence, does not directly prove the fact in question but supports it through inference. In this case, 'Z' saw 'A' with a knife shortly before the murder, which does not directly prove that 'A' killed 'B', but it is a relevant circumstance that can be linked to the crime. Types of Evidences Feature Documentary Evidence Oral Evidence Expert Evidence Definition Written or printed documents produced for court inspection Statements made before the court by witnesses Opinion from a person specially skilled in the relevant field Legal Admissibility Admissible as primary evidence Admissible; allows cross-examination Admissible under specific conditions (Sec. 39, BSA) Reliability High, if properly maintained Can vary; subject to witness credibility High, if from a qualified expert Specific Medical Examples Medical certificates, hospital records, lab reports Doctor's testimony, nurse's account of patient care Medical examiner's report, specialist's opinion on treatment Circumstantial evidence or indirect evidence: It is the evidence consisting of collateral facts from which an inference may be drawn and are consistent with the direct evidence, such as finding blood on the clothes of the accused. Direct (Option A): Direct evidence provides immediate proof of a fact, such as an eyewitness seeing the murder occur. Here, 'Z' did not witness the murder itself, so the evidence is not direct. Hostile (Option C): A witness becomes hostile when they deviate from their original statement or intentionally withhold information to favor the accused. There is no indication that 'Z' was hostile in this case. Hearsay evidence (Option D): Any evidence that is offered by a witness of which he/she does not have direct knowledge but his/her testimony is based on what others have said. For example, a relative overhearing a conversation between doctors discussing a possible misdiagnosis. Since 'Z' personally saw 'A' with the knife, this is not hearsay.

      "question": "A 30 year old apparently healthy man who was carrying laxatives and enema apparatus developed abdominal pain at the airport and an x-ray was done which appears as shown below. Which of the following is the likely diagnosis?",
      "options": {
        "A": "Bezoar syndrome",
        "B": "Pica due to anaemia",
        "C": "Body packer syndrome",
        "D": "Constipation due to fecalith"
      },
      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: C) Body packer syndrome Explanation: Body packer's syndrome, also called the surgical mules syndrome is a planned activity to smuggle drugs. The drug to be smuggled is usually wrapped in polythene or condom, and swallowed/planted inside vagina or rectum. The x-ray shows cylindrical objects which may be containers for the drugs. Incorrect Options: Bezoar Syndrome (Option A): It is a syndrome in which there is a tightly packed collection of something inside the stomach. Usually, bezoar occurs for a collection of hair inside the stomach, but it can be any indigestible natural/unnatural object. Pica due to anemia (Option B): It does not present as shown in the case history. Constipation due to fecalith (Option D): It mostly shows excessive bloating, not shown in the x ray.
