      "question": "A registered medical practitioner is requested by a survivor of sexual violence to examine her. Within what time must the practitioner take a vaginal swab to look for the presence of spermatozoa?",
      "options": {
        "A": "Within 72 hours",
        "B": "Within 36 hours",
        "C": "Within 5 day",
        "D": "Within 48 hours"
      },
      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: A) Within 72 hours Explanation: Timeliness of Evidence Collection: Recovery of trace evidence diminishes over time. Sperm detection: Motile sperm: up to 12 hours in the vagina. Non-motile sperm: up to 72 hours. Within 36 hours (Option B), Within 5 days (Option C), & Within 48 hours (Option D) are all incorrect options. Sperm can remain in the vagina for up to 72 hours , but the motility of sperm decreases over time. Non-motile sperm can still be detected within this time frame, making it crucial to collect evidence within 72 hours for accurate results.

      "question": "What will be the gestational age of the fetus if the crown rump length is 21 cm and the length of the lower limb is 10 cm?",
      "options": {
        "A": "6 to 7 months",
        "B": "4 to 5 months",
        "C": "7 to 8 months",
        "D": "Term"
      },
      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "gestational age during early pregnancy. It is the length from the top of the head (crown) to the bottom of the buttocks (rump) of the fetus. In this case, the CRL is 21 cm. Generally, during the 6th to 7th month of pregnancy, the CRL of the fetus ranges from 20 to 24 cm. Since the given measurement falls within this range, the gestational age of the fetus can be estimated as 6 to 7 months. Incorrect Options: Option B . 4 to 5 months: This option can be ruled out because the CRL measurement of 21 cm is larger than the typical CRL range for the 4th to 5th month, which is around 11 to 14 cm. Option C . 7 to 8 months: This option can also be eliminated because the CRL measurement of 21 cm is smaller than the typical CRL range for the 7th to 8th month, which is around 26 to 30 cm. Option D. Term: Term refers to the end of the pregnancy when the fetus is fully developed and ready for delivery, which usually occurs around 37 to 42 weeks of gestation. The given CRL measurement of 21 cm is smaller than what would be expected at term. At term, the CRL is typically around 35 to 38 cm.",
