Aluminum Phosphide (Option A): Aluminum phosphide poisoning is treated with supportive care, magnesium sulfate, and antioxidants. Mercury (Option B): Mercury poisoning is treated with chelating agents such as dimercaprol, succimer, or DMSA. Arsenic (Option D): Arsenic poisoning is treated with chelators like dimercaprol or succimer.

      "question": "A student presents with shock, pulmonary edema, and a positive silver nitrate breath test after consuming an unknown substance. What is the antidote? I",
      "options": {
        "A": "BAL",
        "B": "Pralidoxime",
        "C": "MgSO",
        "D": "Atropine"

      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "I Aluminum phosphide poisoning releases phosphine gas, which causes severe mitochondrial dysfunction, circulatory collapse, and pulmonary edema. Magnesium sulfate stabilizes myocardial membranes and helps counteract hypomagnesemia, a common complication. Management includes supportive care (fluids, vasopressors, oxygen therapy), magnesium sulfate, and antioxidants. Antidotes and their mechanisms Poisoning Type Antidote Mechanism Arsenic BAL (Dimercaprol) (Option A ruled out) IM, chelates arsenic for excretion. Succimer (DMSA) Oral chelation. DMPS IV, transitioned to oral chelation. Copper Potassium Ferrocyanide Forms insoluble copper complexes, reducing absorption. Penicillamine Chelates copper. Cyanide Sodium Nitrite Forms methemoglobin to bind cyanide. Sodium Thiosulfate Converts cyanide to thiocyanate for renal excretion. Hydroxocobalamin Binds cyanide, forming cyanocobalamin. Dicobalt Edetate, Methylene Blue Alternative antidotes. Ethylene Glycol Ethanol/Fomepizole Inhibits alcohol dehydrogenase to prevent toxic metabolites. Iron Desferrioxamine Chelates iron for excretion. Magnesium Hydroxide/Sodium Bicarbonate Note: BAL should not be used in iron, cadmium, or selenium poisoning due to formation of toxic complexes. Precipitate iron, reducing absorption. Lead Sodium/Magnesium Sulfate Forms insoluble lead sulfate. Calcium Chloride/Gluconate Promotes bone deposition of lead. CaNa2EDTA + BAL Chelation therapy for lead elimination. Mercury Sodium Formaldehyde Sulfoxylate Reduces toxic mercury ions. BAL (Dimercaprol) Traditional chelator; oral agents preferred. Methanol Ethanol/Fomepizole Compete for alcohol dehydrogenase, preventing toxic metabolites. Opium Naloxone Blocks opioid receptors, reversing opioid effects. Organophosphate Atropine (Option D ruled out) Blocks muscarinic receptors to manage cholinergic symptoms. Pralidoxime (2-PAM) (Option B ruled out) Reactivates acetylcholinesterase. Phenol Magnesium Sulfate Absorbs phenol in the stomach. Phosphorus Potassium Permanganate Oxidizes phosphorus into harmless phosphates. Strychnine Barbiturates Depress CNS, preventing seizures. Thallium Prussian Blue Binds thallium in the intestine, preventing absorption.

      "question": "A 10-year-old child was brought to the emergency department after consuming a significant quantity of iron tablets at home. The child is presenting with severe abdominal pain, profuse gastrointestinal bleeding episodes, and lethargy. What is the preferred treatment for this case?",
      "options": {
        "A": "Pencillamine",
        "B": "BAL",
        "C": "Activated charcoal",
        "D": "Deferoxamine Mesylate"
      },
      "correct_answer": "D",
      "explanation": "chelating agent specifically used to treat iron poisoning. It forms a complex with iron, which is then excreted through the urine. Iron poisoning can lead to severe complications, such as gastrointestinal bleeding and organ damage, so prompt and effective treatment with Deferoxamine Mesylate is essential. Incorrect Options: Option A - Pencillamine: Penicillamine is a chelating agent primarily used to treat Wilson's disease and rheumatoid arthritis. It is not the preferred treatment for iron poisoning. Option B - BAL (British Anti-Lewisite or Dimercaprol): BAL is a chelating agent used to treat heavy metal poisoning, such as lead and arsenic poisoning. It is not the preferred treatment for iron poisoning. Option C - Activated charcoal: Activated charcoal is used to absorb certain toxins in the gastrointestinal tract. However, in the case of iron poisoning, it is not effective because iron tablets have already been absorbed and are causing systemic effects.",

      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: B) Bagging Explanation: Methods of substance abuse Explanation Bagging ( Option B ) Bagging refers to a method of inhaling substances by placing them inside a bag and then inhaling or breathing in the vapors. The bag is typically held over the nose and mouth, allowing the person to inhale the substance contained within the bag. Snorting ( Option A ) Snorting involves the inhalation of powdered substances, typically drugs, through the nose. The substance is crushed into a fine powder and then snorted through the nostrils using a straw, rolled-up paper, or other devices. Sniffing ( Option C ) Sniffing refers to the act of inhaling or smelling substances, often volatile or aromatic substances. Huffing ( Option D ) Huffing involves the deliberate inhalation of volatile substances or inhalants directly from their container or source. This method is associated with the misuse of chemicals, solvents, or other volatile substances for recreational purposes. Reference: Substance abuse",

      "question": "A man was found to be lying dead on the ground. His friend saw a snake passing in the area and took a picture of it and showed it to the doctor (image below). What is the most probable cause of death of this man?",
      "options": {
        "A": "Shock",
        "B": "Respiratory failure",
        "C": "Coagulopathy",
        "D": "Renal failure"
      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: B) Respiratory failure Explanation: The most probable cause of death in this scenario is respiratory failure, commonly associated with neurotoxic snake venom. The snake seen was likely an elapid (krait), which are neurotoxic species. Neurotoxic venom affects the nervous system, leading to paralysis of the respiratory muscles (diaphragm). Mechanism : Neurotoxins block neuromuscular transmission by inhibiting acetylcholine at the neuromuscular junction. Leads to progressive muscle paralysis, including respiratory muscles, causing respiratory failure and death. Incorrect Options: Shock (Option A): Typically seen in viper bites (vasculotoxic) due to severe hypotension and tissue damage. Coagulopathy (Option C): Common in viper bites causing hemotoxic effects like bleeding and DIC. Renal failure (Option D): Seen in hemotoxic bites causing acute tubular necrosis due to hemoglobinuria or myoglobinuria. Reference: Snakes",

      "question": "Gastric lavage, commonly known as stomach pumping or gastric irrigation, is a procedure performed to remove the contents of the stomach. It has been widely used since the early 19th century as a standard method to eliminate toxins from the stomach. This procedure is typically employed for individuals who have consumed poison or overdosed on substances like ethanol. Additionally, it may be performed prior to surgery to empty the digestive tract. In which of the following situations is gastric lavage not recommended?",
      "options": {
        "A": "Organo-Phosphosphate poisoning",
        "B": "Hydrocarbons",
        "C": "Ethanol poisoning",
        "D": "PCM toxicity"
      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "or gastric irrigation, is the process of cleaning out the contents of the stomach. It is typically used in cases of poisoning or drug overdose. However, there are certain conditions in which gastric lavage is contraindicated. In this case, gastric lavage is contraindicated in hydrocarbon poisoning (Option B). Hydrocarbons, such as gasoline, kerosene, or petroleum-based solvents, have a low viscosity and can easily aspirate into the lungs during gastric lavage, leading to serious complications like chemical pneumonitis or aspiration pneumonia. Therefore, gastric lavage should not be performed in cases of hydrocarbon ingestion. Incorrect options: Option A: Organo-Phosphate poisoning (Option A): Gastric lavage is indicated in cases of organophosphate poisoning to remove the toxin from the stomach. Option C: Ethanol poisoning (Option C): Gastric lavage is indicated in cases of Ethanol poisoning to remove the toxin from the stomach. Option D: PCM toxicity (Option D): PCM toxicity refers to poisoning with paracetamol (acetaminophen). Gastric lavage is indicated in cases of paracetamol overdose within 4 hours of ingestion.
