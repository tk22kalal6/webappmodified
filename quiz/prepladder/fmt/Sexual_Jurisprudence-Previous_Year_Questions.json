      "explanation": "proceedings are used to ensure the privacy and protection of the victim. These proceedings are not open to the public, which helps maintain the victim's confidentiality and reduce the emotional impact of the court process. Closed court sessions help protect the victim from public scrutiny and potential re-traumatization. Incorrect Options: Option A - Open court proceedings: Open court proceedings are accessible to the public and can expose the victim to unnecessary stress and scrutiny. Such settings do not provide the privacy needed for sensitive cases like sexual assault. Option C - Hearing on different location: While a hearing might be conducted from a different location for logistical reasons (e.g., via video link), this is not specifically designed to protect the privacy of the victim in the same way that closed court proceedings do. Option D - Hearing on camera: Although on-camera recordings may be used to record testimony, this does not replace the need for closed court proceedings. On-camera recordings are part of the procedure to ensure that evidence is preserved and presented appropriately, but they are generally conducted within the framework of closed court proceedings to ensure the privacy of the victim.",

      "explanation": "abuse of a young child, the hymen is more likely to be unruptured rather than ruptured. This is because the hymen is situated deeper inside the vaginal canal in children and is not easily accessible or visible externally. Incorrect Options: Ruptured since it is superficially ( (Option A): The hymen is not superficially located in children. It is positioned deeper inside the vagina. Ruptured since it is very thin (Option B): While the hymen is thin, its thinness does not necessarily imply that it will be ruptured in cases of rape or sexual abuse. Unruptured since it is highly elastic (Option D): The elasticity of the hymen enables it to stretch, but it does not guarantee that it will remain unruptured in cases of sexual abuse Reference: Knight's Forensic Pathology 4th Edition.2016 Pg no.: 429-431",

        "D": "3, 4, 5 are true"
      },
      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: C) 1, 3, 5 are true Explanation: Document informed refusal (True) : It is important to document that the 14-year-old girl has expressed her informed refusal for an examination. This ensures that the healthcare professional has made her aware of the medical and legal consequences of her decision, while respecting her autonomy. Do not inform the police (False) : Regardless of the girl's consent, sexual activity with a minor (<18 years old) is considered statutory rape. The law mandates that such incidents be reported to the police immediately to ensure the minor's protection. Counsel the mother and daughter (True) : The healthcare professional should counsel both on the legal implications, reporting importance, and emotional impact. Examine with necessary force (False) : An examination should not be forced if the patient refuses. It should proceed only with consent or legal authority. Inform the police (True) : The healthcare professional is legally obligated to inform the police in cases of statutory rape to ensure legal protection for the minor. Procedures in a Rape Victim: Initial Steps: The police should advise the survivor not to bathe or change clothes to preserve evidence. The scene of the offense may be visited if necessary. The medical officer must ensure the survivor is treated with sensitivity and in an environment of trust, particularly when the survivor is from a marginalized group. Examination Procedure: A police requisition is required, except when the victim approaches the doctor directly. Informed consent must be obtained for the examination and evidence collection. The survivor has the right to refuse parts of the examination, but this refusal should be documented. Consent must be signed by the survivor (if ≥ 12 years old) or their guardian (if <12 years old). The survivor can refuse to report to the police, but the doctor is still required to inform them about the incident. Examining Process: The victim should be identified, and a female doctor or attendant should ideally conduct the examination, or a female presence should be maintained. The examination should be carried out promptly to prevent loss of evidence. Statements from the victim and accompanying persons should be recorded separately, especially if the abuser is present. Special care should be given to transgender or intersex individuals, respecting their preferences for examination. Additional Considerations: Survivors with disabilities or from vulnerable groups (like sex workers) should be handled with particular care and their consent for examination should be respected. Past sexual encounters should not be documented unless relevant to the current incident. The Supreme Court recognizes that non-consensual intercourse with sex workers constitutes rape.
