      "options": {
        "A": "McNaughton rule",
        "B": "Durham's rule",

      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "determine whether a defendant is criminally responsible if they were suffering from a severe mental illness at the time of the crime. McNaughten Rule: The key principle states that every person is presumed sane until proven otherwise. To establish a defence of insanity, it must be proven that the accused, at the time of the act, had a mental disease that prevented them from understanding the nature of the act or recognising it as wrong. Legal Test of Insanity (Right or Wrong Test): A person is not criminally responsible if they did not know the nature of their act or that it was wrong at the time of the crime. Requirements include: Evidence of a mental disease. The mental disease must be present at the time of the crime. The condition must be severe enough to prevent understanding that the act is wrong or illegal. Criminal responsibility of insane persons rules: Durham’s Rule (1954) : An accused is not criminally responsible if their unlawful act results from a mental disease or defect. (Option B ruled out) Curren’s Rule (1964) : An accused is not criminally responsible if, due to a mental disease or defect, they were unable to regulate their conduct according to the law at the time of the act. (Option C ruled out) American Law Institute Test (1970) : A person is not responsible for criminal actions if, due to mental disease or defect, they lack adequate capacity to understand the wrongfulness of their actions or to conform to legal requirements. Brawner Rule (1972) : Insanity determinations should be made by a jury, which has the discretion to decide the \"insanity question.\" The Irresistible Impulse : This rule posits that an individual may recognize an act as illegal but, due to mental impairment, cannot control their actions. For example, Lorena Bobbitt was acquitted in 1994 by arguing that an irresistible impulse led her to commit her crime.

      "question": "According to the law, nothing is an offense if a person is of an unsound mind and is not able to understand that the nature and consequences of his/her act are wrong. Which rule of insanity applies in this case?",
      "options": {
        "A": "Durham's rule",
        "B": "Mc Naughton's rule",
        "C": "Curren's rule",
        "D": "Irresistible impulse rule"
      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer B - Mc Naughton's rule McNaughton's rules state that \"Nothing is an offense done by a person who is incapable of knowing that he is doing is wrong due to mental illness\". The rules of insanity in forensic medicine are primarily governed by the McNaughten Rules (1843), which establish the legal criteria for determining criminal responsibility in cases involving mental illness. McNaughten Rules (Key Principles): Presumption of Sanity: Every individual is presumed sane unless proven otherwise. Defect of Reason: The accused must suffer from a severe mental disease causing a defect of reason. Inability to Understand the Nature of the Act: The individual must be unable to understand the nature and quality of the act they were committing. Inability to Distinguish Right from Wrong: The person must be incapable of understanding that the act was wrong due to their mental condition. Durham's Rule (Option A): states that a criminal cannot be convicted of a crime if the act was a result of a mental disease or defect the criminal had at the time of the incident. Curren's Rule (Option C): An accused person will not be criminally responsible if, at the time of committing the act, he did not have the capacity to regulate his conduct to the requirements of law, as a result of mental disease or defect. Irresistible impulse rule (Option D): According to the Irresistible Impulse rule in jurisdictions defendants typically must present sufficient evidence to prove the existence of mental illness and that the mental illness caused the inability to control one's actions or conform one's conduct to the law.

        "C": "IPC 84",
        "D": "IPC 85"
      },
      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer C - IPC 84 McNaughten Rule: Sec. 84 IPC deals with the criminal responsibility of insane persons. It states that: “Nothing is an offence which is done by a person who, at the time of doing it, because of unsoundness of mind, is incapable of knowing the nature of the act, or what he is doing is either wrong or contrary to the law”. BNS Section 22: Nothing is an offence done by a person who, at the time of doing it, because of unsoundness of mind, is incapable of knowing the nature of the act, or that he is doing what is either wrong or contrary to law. The key principle states that every person is presumed sane until proven otherwise. To establish a defence of insanity, it must be proven that the accused, at the time of the act, had a mental disease that prevented them from understanding the nature of the act or recognising it as wrong. Legal Test of Insanity (Right or Wrong Test): A person is not criminally responsible if they did not know the nature of their act or that it was wrong at the time of the crime. Requirements include: Evidence of a mental disease. The mental disease must be present at the time of the crime. The condition must be severe enough to prevent understanding that the act is wrong or illegal. IPC 82 (Option A) : Deals with children under 7 years of age who are presumed incapable of committing a crime due to their age, and thus cannot be held criminally responsible. IPC 83 (Option B) : Concerns children between 7 and 12 years old . They can be criminally liable, but only if they possess the maturity to understand the nature of their act. It allows a defense of insanity if the child is incapable of understanding the nature of the act. IPC 85 (Option D) : Addresses acts done by persons of unsound mind under the influence of intoxication. If intoxication is involuntary, the person can use it as a defense to not be held criminally responsible.

      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "an individual does an act or crime with an unsound mind. So, at the time of the crime, the person forgot about the nature of the act and could not understand whether he or she was doing something wrong or contrary to the law, equivalent to McNaughten's rule. Incorrect options: Option A: According to section 82 under the Indian Penal Code states that when a child below 7 years old commits an action or a crime will not be considered an offense. As the child is immature at that particular age, he cannot commit any crime with hidden intentions. Option B: Act 83 is also the same because it states when a child above 7 years and under 12 years old commits a crime with immature understanding. So, it is not an offense as children between 7 to 12 years do not know the future consequences of their actions. Option D: According to section 85, nothing will be an offense committed by a person incapable of judgment because of the intoxication caused against that individual's will. As the individual was intoxicated, the person lost the understanding of right and wrong, and that individual did the crime without knowledge.",

      "question": "Which of the following tests relies on the principle that the suspect's reaction is influenced by their prior knowledge of the events or activity?",
      "options": {
        "A": "Truth Serum",
        "B": "Polygraph",
        "C": "Brain Mapping",
        "D": "Hypnosis"
      },
      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "imaging (fMRI), is a test that is based on the principle that prior knowledge of events or activity can influence a person's brain activity and responses. By analyzing the brain's neural activity and patterns, brain mapping aims to detect deception or hidden information. It measures changes in blood flow and oxygenation in different areas of the brain to determine if specific stimuli or questions elicit different responses. This method is used in forensic investigations to assess a person's knowledge or involvement in certain events. Incorrect Options Option A : Truth Serum - Truth serum refers to a drug or chemical agent administered to a person with the intention of eliciting truthful information. However, the reliability and effectiveness of truth serum in obtaining accurate information are highly debated. Its use is not widely accepted in legal or investigative settings, and it is not considered a reliable method of determining truth. Option B : Polygraph- A polygraph, commonly known as a lie detector test, measures physiological changes in a person's body such as heart rate, blood pressure, and respiration while they are asked a series of questions. Although polygraph tests are widely used, their accuracy and reliability are controversial. The results of a polygraph test are not considered definitive evidence of deception and are often not admissible in court. Option D : Hypnosis- Hypnosis involves inducing an altered state of consciousness in a person where they are more receptive to suggestions. While hypnosis can be used in investigative settings, its reliability and accuracy in eliciting truthful information are debated. The use of hypnosis as evidence or a definitive method for determining truth is not widely accepted.",
