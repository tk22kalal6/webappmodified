      "options": {
        "A": "True virgin",
        "B": "False virgin",
        "C": "Premenstrual stage",
        "D": "Molestation"
      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: B) False virgin Explanation: Category True Virgin (Option A ruled out) False Virgin Genital Signs Intact, rigid, inelastic hymen; admits only a fingertip, causing pain. Thick, fleshy labia majora that close the vaginal orifice; small, pink labia minora covered by labia majora. Narrow vagina with prominent rugae; full finger cannot be admitted. Present fossa navicularis, intact fourchette, narrow vestibule, small clitoris, intact posterior commissure. Intact hymen that may be loose, elastic, or thick; admits two fingers easily. Less fleshy labia majora; vaginal orifice may be visible; enlarged, pigmented labia minora. Roomy vagina with less prominent rugae; full finger can be admitted. Disappearance of fossa navicularis; torn and healed fourchette; wider vestibule; enlarged clitoris; possibly torn posterior commissure. Extra-Genital Signs Small, hemispherical, firm breasts; pink areola. Larger, pendulous, flabby breasts; pigmented areola. Premenstrual stage (Option C) genitalia are underdeveloped, with thick labia majora, small labia minora, and a firm hymen admitting only small instruments. The patient's findings suggest a post-pubertal state, not a premenstrual stage. Molestation (Option D) may involve bruises, hymenal tears, and disrupted commissures. While a fourchette tear is present, the intact hymen and absence of other trauma make this less likely.
