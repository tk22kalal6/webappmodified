      },
      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: A) AC current Explanation: Ac current is more dangerous because it causes continuous muscle contractions, making it harder to release the source of shock. It can also disrupt the heart rhythm, leading to fatal arrhythmias. Electrocution(Electrical injuries) Refers to injury or death caused by electric shock. It occurs when an electric current passes through the body, disrupting normal bodily functions, particularly the heart, muscles, and nerves. Electricity exerts two major effects on the body: Cellular depolarisation of nerves and muscles. Heat production Factors influencing electrocution: Current Type: AC (alternating current) is more dangerous than DC (direct current) at similar voltage levels because AC causes continuous muscle contractions and is more likely to induce ventricular fibrillation. Voltage Level: Electrocution is rare at <100V and most deaths occur at >200V.Amperage is more important as it indicates the actual intensity of electricity, which passes through the body. Resistance of the Body: The human body’s resistance varies by tissue type (blood, muscle, fat, and skin). Wet or broken skin decreases resistance, increasing the likelihood of severe injuries whereas dry skin offers higher resistance. Duration of Contact: Longer exposure leads to more severe injuries. Short contact may cause local burns, while prolonged contact can result in heart and respiratory failure. Pathway of Current: Death is more likely to occur if the brain stem or heart is in the direct path of the current. Effects due to passage of electricity: Low Tension Injuries (<1000V): Typically cause superficial burns at the points of entry and exit. Most common sites of low-voltage contact entry injury are hands(fingers) and that of exit injury is foot or opposite hand. Muscle contractions, tetany, and possible ventricular fibrillation may occur. Victims may suffer from arrhythmias or cardiac arrest if the current crosses the heart. High Tension Injuries (>1000V): Injuries can be caused by three sources- flash, flame or the current itself. High voltage causes deeper burns, organ damage, and massive tissue destruction. It may lead to immediate cardiac or respiratory arrest. The current can cause thermal injuries, with electricity creating heat as it passes through the body. Crocodile skin lesions : Third degree burns or red brown punch out spark lesions. Characteristics of Injuries: Entry Wounds: Typically small and well-defined, resembling a burn. In low tension injuries, the area might be red and blistered; in high tension injuries, there may be charring or significant tissue damage. Exit Wounds: Larger than the entry wound, often with greater tissue damage. High",

      "explanation": "Correct Answer: B) Chance fracture of the lumbar spine Explanation : The Chance fracture/Seat belt fracture, a horizontal fracture through the vertebral body, pedicles and spinous process of the lumbar spine, is commonly associated with seat belt injuries. Chance fracture: Horizontal or transverse fracture through the vertebral body, pedicles, and spinous process, commonly affecting the lumbar spine. Mechanism of Injury: Results from a flexion-distraction force (bending and pulling apart) on the spine, typically during sudden deceleration, such as in motor vehicle accidents with improper or no shoulder restraint. Flexion-distraction spinal injury with no rotation of the fracture fragments or lateral displacement. Often associated with seat belt injuries when only the lap belt is used, leading to significant force across the lumbar spine. Most commonly occurs in the thoracolumbar region (T10-L2). Clinical Presentation: Patients may report lower back pain and possibly abdominal pain due to associated organ injuries. Diagnosis : Diagnosed through X-ray or CT scan, showing a horizontal fracture line through the posterior elements of the spine. Treatment : immobilization and surgical stabilization.Usually reduced on Risser table by applying hyper extension to the injured thoracolumbar area. Smith fracture (Option A): Distal radius fracture with palmar (volar) displacement, typically from a fall on a flexed wrist. Barton fracture (Option C): Intra-articular distal radius fracture with dislocation of the carpal bones, usually from a fall on an outstretched hand. Colles fracture (Option D): Distal radius fracture with dorsal displacement, commonly resulting from a fall on an extended wrist.",

      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: A) Contrecoup injury Explanation: Contrecoup injury occurs when the brain strikes the opposite side of the skull from where the impact occurred, often seen in tertiary impact injuries. Secondary injuries/Tertiary impact injuries Results from body parts, striking the ground, following primary and secondary impact and are more lethal. When the pedestrian is thrown to the ground, he/she sustains abrasions, bruises or lacerations over the bony prominences. Contrecoup injury: Brain damage is frequent without any associated skull fracture due to moving head of the victim, being suddenly stopped on impact, resulting in diffuse damage to the axons. Fracture of the skull and ribs due to direct contact and fracture of spine due to hyper flexion or extension. Sometimes, pedestrians are run over if knocked down by the vehicle. This will tend to occur if the pedestrian centre of gravity is lower than the impact site. Tyre tread marks on one surface of the body with graze like abrasions on the opposite side. Compression of the chest resulting in flail chest. Flaying injury: Avulsion injury when the wheel moves over a fleshy part causing degloving of skin and subcutaneous tissue by tearing it away from underlying tissue . Burning and singing of skin and hair, resulting from discharge of hot exhaust. Tailgating injury (Option B): Unique injury wherein the motorcyclist drives under the rear of the truck, causing head injuries and decapitation. Terrible triad injury (Option C): This refers to a specific set of injuries to the elbow (dislocation, radial head fracture, coronoid fracture), not related to tertiary impact.

Femoral fracture Intra-thoracic or abdominal injury Contralateral head injury. Pedestrian Injuries Most common type of transportation injuries which are blunt for injuries, the Tucker from travel on the ground, in the air and on water. Three pattern of pedestrian injuries seen: primary impact injuries Secondary impact injuries Secondary injuries / Tertiary impact injuries Primary Impact Injuries: Injuries Occur when the victim is struck by the vehicle, often following recognizable patterns. Common injuries include abrasions, lacerations, fractures of legs, thighs, or buttocks, and fractures of the fibula and tibia. When an adult is hit by a car, the impact is often at knee level, and injuries vary depending on the victim’s position and vehicle orientation. Common cause of death is due to head injury and fracture dislocation of cervical spine, mainly at the atlanto-occipital joint. Factors influencing injury behavior include Position of the victim's feet (whether they were firmly placed or raised at impact). Speed of the vehicle (low speed results in being thrown onto the bonnet; at higher speeds, the victim is projected or scooped up). Road surface type (smooth, rough, gravel). Point of impact relative to the center of gravity. When the pedestrian is knocked down from behind with both feet fixed to the ground, there will be fracture of the bones of the lower limbs. Waddell's Triad A classic pattern in pedestrian children struck by vehicles. Fractured femoral shaft. Intrathoracic or intra-abdominal injuries. Contralateral head injury. Injury Behavior Based on Position and Vehicle Impact On Being struck from behind with feet not firmly on the ground: The victim’s feet are thrown backwards. Possible head injuries from striking against the windscreen. Victims can be scooped up or fall to one side, sustaining further head injuries from striking the ground. Struck from the front: Injuries to chest, abdomen, with potential fractures of ribs or vertebrae. Pelvic or sacroiliac fractures, as well as fractures of the tibia or fibula from bumper impact. Bumper impact injuries: Soft tissue damage and fractures (typically wedge-shaped). Fractures may suggest the point of impact and movement direction of the vehicle. The location and measurement of the bumper fracture on the victim provide details about the vehicle's height and speed. Wedge type bumper fracture of the tibia seen. Marks may suggest if the victim was walking or lying on the road when struck. When the pedestrian walks into the side of a moving vehicle Glancing abrasions Crushing lacerations on the side or front of the face, chest and arms. Fracture of ribs with or without laceration. Sustain secondary injuries Fracture of the skull occurs due to direct impact of the vehicle on the head. Secondary impact injuries: Often seen in cases of scooped up victims being thrown over the bonnet. The person sustains injuries by hitting his head against the windscreen, its rim or side pillars.

Motorcycle Injuries An accident that might result in minor injuries with an automobile,can result in death with a motorcycle. Motorcyclists experience death rate 35 times greater than the occupants of a car. Most common causes of motorcycle accidents are alcohol, drugs and environmental factors like potholes, bumps, reckless driving. Most common cause of motorcycle fatality is running off the road. Most injuries are due to ejection from the vehicle into the roads, due to high speed and instability of the vehicle. Primary injuries: Open fracture of tibia and fibula. Secondary injuries: Fractures of skull, ribs and cervical spine. Hinge fracture / Motorcyclist fracture: Transverse fracture of the base of the skull is common Temporo-parietal fractures are also common with ring fractures around foramen magnum. Passengers falling off the backs of the motorcycle will have lacerations of the back of the head, fractures of posterior cranial fossa. Blood samples should be analysed for the presence and amount of alcohol and drugs, if consumed since the question of contributory negligence may subsequently arise.

      "question": "A 7 year old child is admitted in ER with burns to the entire posterior trunk and the left lower limb. Using the Lund and Browder chart, calculate the percentage of total body surface area (TBSA) affected?",
      "options": {
        "A": "25%",
        "B": "35%",
        "C": "36%",
        "D": "40%"
      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: B) 35% Explanation Lund and Browder Chart adjusts the percentage of body surface area burned according to the patient’s age, accounting for developmental changes in body proportions. For a 7-year-old: Posterior trunk: 18% of TBSA. Left lower limb: (14 + 6 x 0.5)% of TBSA = 17% of TBSA. Total affected TBSA = 18% + 17% = 35%. The use of the Lund and Browder chart is vital in forensic cases to accurately assess injury severity in cases of burns in children. The estimation of Total Body Surface Area (TBSA) using Wallace's Rule of Nines is not precise for children due to their proportionately larger head surface area. Body Surface Area Assessment in Children (Lund and Browder Chart) Baseline Percentages (Under 1 Year) Head: 18% of Total Body Surface Area (TBSA) Each Leg: 14% of TBSA Trunk and Arms: Same as adult percentages Age Adjustment Formula For each year over age 1: Add 0.5% to each leg Subtract 1.0% from head Continue adjustments until adult values are reached. Example Calculation For a 3-year-old child: Start with baseline values Adjust for 2 years (age 1 to 3): Legs: 14% + (2 × 0.5%) = 15% each Head: 18% - (2 × 1.0%) = 16% Reference: Goutam Biswas Review of Forensic Medicine and Toxicology, 3rd edition, page 269",

      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: B) 22.5% Explanation According to the Wallace Rule of Nines, the anterior trunk accounts for 18% of TBSA, and the anterior right upper limb contributes an additional 4.5%, making a total of 22.5% in this scenario.
