      "question": "Marshall's triad (punctate lacerations, bruises, and abrasions) is seen in which type of blast injury?",
      "options": {
        "A": "Primary blast injury B) Secondary blast injury C) Tertiary blast injury D) Quaternary blast injury",
        "B": "Secondary blast injury",
        "C": "Tertiary blast injury",
        "D": "Quaternary blast injury"
      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "in Marshall's triad: punctate lacerations, bruises, and abrasions , characteristic of injuries from high-velocity fragments. Blast Injury: Blast injuries are complex physical traumas resulting from direct or indirect exposure to an explosion, leading to sudden changes in atmospheric pressure. Classification of Blast Injuries: Type Mechanism Features Primary Injury (Option A ruled out) It results from blast waves and is often internal with no external signs. Ears: Tympanic membrane rupture or inner ear disruption. Lungs: Alveolar-capillary membrane haemorrhage (blast lung), most common cause cause of death in survivors. GIT: Injuries to gas-filled organs are more common in underwater blasts. Secondary Injury It is resulting from shrapnel, debris & flying objects (propelled by explosion). Penetrating trauma. The characteristic Marshall triad, which includes bruises, abrasions, and punctate lacerations, is evident. Commonly cause severe thoracic injuries, including lacerations of the heart and great vessels. Tertiary Injury (Option C ruled out) Victims are thrown against solid objects by blast winds. Blunt/Penetrating trauma. Includes bone fractures and coup-contrecoup injuries. Quaternary Injury (Option D ruled out) Encompass all other injuries not classified above Flash burns from extreme heat. Crush injuries and falls due to explosions. Respiratory injuries from toxic dust, gases, or radiation exposure. Psychiatric issues, such as post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), may affect individuals even if they are physically unharmed.

      "question": "What causes the blackening around a gunshot entry wound?",
      "options": {
        "A": "Smoke particles",
        "B": "Unburned gunpowder",
        "C": "Muzzle of firearm",
        "D": "Fire effect"
      },
      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: A) Smoke particles Explanation: The blackening is caused by soot or smoke particles from the combustion of gunpowder, which adhere to the skin around the entry wound. This phenomenon is typically observed in close-range gunshot wounds. Incorrect Options: Unburned gunpowder (Option B): Tattooing or stippling results from the impact of partially burned or unburned gunpowder particles on the skin. These cause small reddish-brown or black marks but do not lead to blackening. Muzzle of firearm (Option C): The muzzle may leave an imprint if the firearm is discharged at close or contact range, but this does not cause the blackening around the wound. Fire effect (Option D): The flame from the firearm may produce thermal burns near the wound, but this is distinct from the blackening caused by smoke particles.

      "question": "Bullet fingerprinting involve:",
      "options": {
        "A": "Primary markings",
        "B": "Secondary markings",
        "C": "Both",
        "D": "None"
      },
      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: C) Both Explanation: Primary markings on bullets include the number, diameter, and width of lands and grooves (striations) and the degree of rifling twist . Surface irregularities serve as secondary markings. These markings allow forensic experts to connect bullets from a crime scene to a specific firearm, aiding in criminal investigations. Primary Markings (Class characteristics) Secondary Markings (Individual or accidental characteristics) Determined by manufacturing specifications, design, and dimensions are most useful for identifying the make and model of the firearm involved. It consists of: Number, diameter and width of lands and grooves Depth of grooves Direction and degree of rifling twist Surface irregularities on the bullet result from imperfections in the barrel and the adhesion of bullet particles to the bore during firing (Metallic Fouling) . It may be identical for bullets fired by two different weapons. These are different for bullets fired by two different weapons, reflecting each firearm's distinct barrel characteristics. It's more pronounced for jacketed bullets. It is more pronounced when the grooves deeply mark the lead bullet. The bullet found in the body, called the crime bullet , is compared under a Comparison Microscope with a test bullet fired from a suspected weapon (using the same brand and type of ammunition).

      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: A) Shot gun wound Explanation: The image shown depicts a typical pattern of injury caused by a shotgun . The appearance of multiple pellet or shot holes, irregular wound edges, and tissue destruction is characteristic of a shotgun wound. Type of shotgun wounds Type of wound Contact Close Short/ Intermediate-range Distant Entry wound Cruciate/Stellate (Skull) or Circular Circular Rat-hole like Multiple small pellet wounds with the mostly dispersed entry wound Border of wound Contused, Irregular and muzzled appearance Clean-cut, irregular or lacerated Abraded and scalloped borders Irregular Blackening Present around the margins and even inside the wound. Present Absent Absent Burning Absent Tattooing Present Images Incorrect Options: Tattooing (Option B): Tattooing refers to pinpoint marks caused by unburned gunpowder particles embedding in the skin around the entry wound, typically seen in close-range firearm injuries. While tattooing can be a feature of shotgun wounds, it is not the primary injury type depicted. Arsenic poisoning (Option C): Arsenic poisoning presents with systemic signs like Mee's lines (white lines on nails), gastrointestinal distress,",
