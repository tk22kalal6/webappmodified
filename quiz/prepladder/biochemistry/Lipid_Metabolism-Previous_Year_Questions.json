Option B - Apo C II: Apo C II is a cofactor for lipoprotein lipase, and defects in this gene are linked to hypertriglyceridemia, not hypercholesterolemia. Option D - Apo B48: Apo B48 is a form of apolipoprotein B that is involved in chylomicron formation and is not related to familial hypercholesterolemia.

        "C": "ACTH",

      "correct_answer": "D",
      "explanation": "Hormone-sensitive lipase is present in the adipose tissues which breaks down fats stored in the adipose tissue to FA + glycerol during fasting and starvation. Since it breaks fats, it is considered a catabolic enzyme. It is activated by the catabolic hormone like glucagon and inhibited by the anabolic hormone insulin. Peripheral lipolysis: It is a process in which triacylglycerols are hydrolyzed into free fatty acids (FFA) and glycerol. This process is mediated by hormone-sensitive lipase (HSL). This process occurs in adipose tissue The lipase acts on triacylglycerols and converts them into diacylglycerol , the preferred substrate for HSL. The glycerol released from the adipose tissue is transported to the liver and participates in glycolysis or gluconeogenesis. Free fatty acids bind to albumin and are transported to muscles, where they are activated into their CoA derivatives and oxidized in mitochondria for ATP. Regulation: HSL is activated when phosphorylated with Protein kinase A, which in turn is dependent on cAMP produced in the adipocyte when catecholamines activate adenylyl cyclase. Insulin dephosphorylates HSL and inactivates it.(Option D) The counter-regulatory hormones of insulin, such as glucagon (Option A), epinephrine (Option B), and cortisol, stimulate the activity of HSL. ACTH (Adrenocorticotropic Hormone) (Option C) While cortisol plays a role in metabolism, it does not directly activate hormone-sensitive lipase. Instead, cortisol can indirectly influence lipid metabolism by affecting other regulatory pathways.",

      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: A) Tangier's disease Explanation: Tangier disease is a rare, autosomal recessive disorder caused by mutations in the ABCA1 (ATP-binding cassette, sub-family A, member 1) gene. Pathophysiology: The ABCA1 protein is crucial for the efflux of cholesterol and phospholipids to apolipoprotein A-I (ApoA-I), forming HDL particles. Mutations in the ABCA1 gene impair this process, leading to a shortage of HDL and cholesterol accumulation in tissues such as the tonsils, liver, spleen, and peripheral nerves. Clinical Features: Greyish-Orange Tonsils: (Hallmark feature) Tonsils, become enlarged and acquire greyish-orange hue due to the accumulation of cholesterol esters Hepatosplenomegaly: Due to cholesterol and phospholipid accumulation. Peripheral Neuropathy: Multiple nerves can be individually affected due to cholesterol deposition in peripheral nerves, leading to peripheral neuropathy.

      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: A) Hexose monophosphate shunt pathway Explanation: The primary source of reducing equivalents (NADPH) for fatty acid synthesis in the liver is the Hexose Monophosphate Shunt (HMP), also called the Pentose Phosphate Pathway (PPP). Fatty acid synthesis involves the conversion of acetyl-CoA into palmitate. This process requires reducing equivalents (NADPH) for the reduction reactions catalyzed by fatty acid synthase. NADPH provides the electrons needed for the reduction of carbonyl groups during fatty acid elongation. HMP Shunt Provides NADPH: Occurs in the cytosol. Glucose-6-phosphate enters the pathway. Key enzyme: Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD). Produces 2 NADPH per glucose molecule oxidized. Ribose-5-phosphate (for nucleotide synthesis) is another product. Reference: HMP pathway",

      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: B) Ketogenesis Explanation: Ketogenesis is absent in muscle tissue because: It occurs exclusively in the liver (mitochondria of hepatocytes). The liver has the necessary enzyme HMG-CoA synthase, which is absent in muscle. Purpose of Ketogenesis: Converts acetyl-CoA into ketone bodies (acetoacetate, Î² -hydroxybutyrate). Ketone bodies are then released into the blood for use by peripheral tissues, including muscle, during fasting or low glucose states. Glycogenolysis (Option A): Muscle breaks down glycogen for its own energy needs during exercise. Glycogenesis (Option C): Muscle stores glycogen for later energy use. Lipolysis (Option D): Muscle can break down triglycerides to obtain fatty acids for energy. Reference: Ketogenesis",
