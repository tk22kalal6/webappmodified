      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: B) Histone deacetylation and methylation in CG islands Explanation: Epigenetic changes that lead to heterochromatin formation are primarily driven by histone deacetylation and methylation of cytidine residues in CG islands. Epigenetic changes involve stable alterations in gene expression that do not involve changes in the nucleotide sequence. Epigenetic Modifications: DNA Methylation: Represses gene expression by methylation of CpG islands. Involved in ageing, cancer, genomic imprinting, X chromosome inactivation, and dysregulation linked to diseases like Fragile X syndrome. Histone Methylation: Suppress or activate transcription depending on the location of methyl groups. Methylation of lysine and arginine residues on histones. Histone Acetylation: Activates transcription (Option A) The addition of acetyl groups neutralises histone charges, relaxing DNA coiling. Generally increases gene expression; affects processes like thyroid hormone synthesis. Histone Deacetylation: Represses transcription. Removal of acetyl groups tightens DNA coiling. Typically, it decreases gene expression and is linked to diseases such as Huntington's disease. DNA replication and Histone phosphorylation( Option C & D): Not associated with Epigenetic modification. Reference: Harper’s Illustrated Biochemistry 32nd Edition Pg - 92",

      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: A) 1 and 2 Explanation: NHEJ and HEJ are the two mechanisms employed by the CRISPR-Cas9 System. It is a powerful tool for inducing precise double-stranded breaks in DNA. CRISPR-Cas9 System Components: Guide RNA (gRNA): Directs the Cas9 enzyme to a specific DNA sequence. Cas9 Enzyme: Induces double-stranded breaks (DSBs) at the target site. Repair Mechanisms: Non-homologous end Joining (NHEJ): This technique directly ligates broken DNA ends without a template, often leading to small insertions or deletions. It can also cause gene knockout by disrupting the coding sequence. Homologous End Joining (HEJ): Uses a homologous template for precise repair of Double strand breaks and enables accurate gene knock-in or correction of mutations. Other DNA repair mechanism are: Base Excision Repair: BER is used to repair small, non-helix-distorting base lesions, not double-stranded breaks. It is not related to CRISPR-Cas9 break repair. Nucleotide Excision Repair: NER repairs bulky DNA lesions (like those caused by UV light), not double-stranded breaks. It is not involved in the repair of CRISPR-Cas9-induced breaks.

Inherited in X-linked Recessive pattern - Primarily affects males (Option C). The gene affected is Dystrophin , which is the largest gene in the human genome, located on the X chromosome (Option A). Dystrophin is a crucial protein found in muscle cells that helps maintain the muscle fibre's structural integrity. It acts as a bridge between sarcolemma and the internal cytoskeleton, which helps in stabilization. Option D: Dystrophin is not a component of the sarcomere but is crucial for anchoring the cytoskeleton to the muscle cell membrane. Sarcomere components involved in contraction include actin and myosin.

      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: B) Determining genetic susceptibility to cardiovascular diseases Explanation: Satellite DNA is not used to identify susceptibility to cardiovascular diseases, as it mainly provides information about repetitive DNA sequences rather than disease susceptibility. Satellite DNA refers to repetitive DNA sequences that are found in specific regions of the genome, notably in centromeric and telomeric regions. Types: Highly Repetitive Sequences (HRS) : These sequences repeats >1,000,000 times. Simple Sequence Repeats (SSR) : Also known as microsatellites, these are short, repetitive sequences. Minisatellite Repeats : Known as Variable Number Tandem Repeats (VNTR), these are longer repetitive sequences compared to microsatellites. Applications: Forensic Identification : Satellite DNA is used in forensic science to identify individuals due to its high variability between people uniquely. Paternal Dispute Resolution : It helps resolve paternal disputes by matching genetic profiles through repetitive DNA sequences. Genetic Studies : To study evolutionary relationships and genetic diversity among different species.

Post-Transcriptional Modification of Eukaryotic RNA: Primary Transcript (hnRNA): Newly synthesised mRNA directly from DNA; includes both coding (exons) and non-coding (introns) regions. Key Modifications: Poly-A Tailing (3 ′ End) Addition of a poly-A tail (20-250 nucleotides) in the nucleoplasm. Protects mRNA from degradation. 5 ′ Capping Addition of a 7-methyl guanosine cap at the 5 ′ end. Involves a 5 ′ to 5 ′ triphosphate bridge. Enhances mRNA stability and translation initiation. Splicing Introns (non-coding regions) are removed, and exons (coding regions) are joined together. This splicing occurs in the nucleus and requires energy. Methylation Methylation of adenine residues and ribose 2 ′ -hydroxyl groups. Primarily occurs in the cytoplasm for tRNA and rRNA.

Western blotting (Option C) Proteins This technique specifically detects and analyses proteins in a complex mixture. It involves separating proteins by gel electrophoresis, transferring them to a membrane, and then using specific antibodies to detect the proteins. Eastern blotting (Option D) Post-translational modifications It refers to specialised Western blotting techniques that detect specific post-translational modifications of proteins, such as phosphorylation or glycosylation.",

        "A": "Type I restriction enzymes",
        "B": "Type II restriction enzymes",

        "D": "Type IV restriction enzymes"
      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: B) Type II restriction enzymes Explanation: Restriction endonucleases are enzymes that cut DNA at specific recognition sequences. Characteristic Type I Type II Subunit structure Complex (3 subunits) Simple (1-2 subunits) ATP requirement Yes No Cleavage site Random, far from recognition site At or near the recognition site Recognition sequence Asymmetric Usually symmetric Type II Restriction Enzyme Subtypes : Sticky End Blunt End Cuts both the DNA strands at two different sites. Cuts both the strands at the same site. Forms two complexes with overhanging ends. Forms two complexes with blunt ends. Type III restriction enzymes(Option C): Recognise specific DNA sequences but cut at a short distance from the recognition site. They do not produce sticky ends and also require ATP. Type IV restriction enzymes(Option D): Target modified DNA, such as methylated DNA, rather than specific sequences. They do not produce sticky ends and are involved in the recognition of modified bases rather than sequence-specific cleavage.
