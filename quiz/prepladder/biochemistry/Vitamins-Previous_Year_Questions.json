Early Signs: Loss of sensitivity to green light. Difficulty adapting to dark places . Night blindness . Prolonged Deficiency: Xerophthalmia: Dry, thick, keratinized conjunctiva and cornea. If untreated, it leads to corneal ulceration and ultimately results in blindness due to the formation of opaque scar tissue. WHO grading of xerophthalmia: XN Night blindness. X1 X1A: Conjunctival xerosis. X1B: Bitot spots. X2 Corneal xerosis. X3 X3A: Corneal ulceration, less than one-third. X3B: Corneal ulceration, more than one-third. XS Corneal scar. XF Xerophthalmic fundus. Bitot's Spots: Grayish-white triangular plaques firmly adherent to the conjunctiva. Keratomalacia: When xerophthalmia persists for a longer time, it progresses to keratomalacia (corneal softening). 2. Immune Function: Deficiency increases susceptibility to infections. Infection reduces retinol-binding protein synthesis, lowering vitamin A levels and impairing immune responses. 3. Skin and Mucous Membrane Lesions: Follicular Hyperkeratosis (Phrynoderma): Causes rough skin due to hyperkeratinization of the follicular epithelium. Keratinizing Metaplasia: Affects respiratory, gastrointestinal, and genitourinary tracts. Epithelium is atrophied. 4.

      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer B - Competitive inhibition: Dicoumarol is a structural analog of vitamin K. It acts as a competitive inhibitor of the enzyme vitamin K epoxide reductase , which is essential for recycling vitamin K to its active form. Competitive Inhibition Inhibitor binds to the active site of an enzyme, competing directly with the substrate. The inhibitor’s presence prevents the substrate from binding, thereby reducing the enzyme’s activity. However, increasing the substrate concentration can overcome this inhibition. Key Features: Binds at the active site. Reversible : Substrate can displace the inhibitor if present in excess. Km increases: Higher substrate concentration is needed to reach half-maximal velocity (). V max remains unchanged: At high substrate concentrations, the enzyme can still achieve its maximum velocity. Examples : Dicoumarol : Inhibits vitamin K epoxide reductase, blocking vitamin K recycling. Sulfonamides : Compete with para-aminobenzoic acid (PABA) for the active site of dihydropteroate synthase, inhibiting bacterial folate synthesis. Statins : Compete with HMG-CoA for HMG-CoA reductase, reducing cholesterol synthesis. Methotrexate : Competes with dihydrofolate for the active site of dihydrofolate reductase, inhibiting nucleotide synthesis. Ethanol : Competes with methanol or ethylene glycol for alcohol dehydrogenase, used in cases of poisoning. Reference: Harper biochemistry ed 32,Pg 79 & 80 Vasudevan ed 7,pg 59&60",

      },
      "correct_answer": "D",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: D) Vitamin B3 Explanation: Niacin toxicity (Vit B3) can lead to macular edema and cysts through increased prostaglandin synthesis, resulting in fluid accumulation in the retina. Mechanism of Macular Edema and cysts: Niacin can raise levels of prostaglandins, particularly prostaglandin D2 (PGD2). Elevated prostaglandin levels lead to increased vascular permeability in the retina. Increased vascular permeability causes fluid and proteins to leak into the retinal layers, resulting in macular edema. Patients may experience blurred vision and distortion in their visual field. Management: Reducing or stopping niacin can resolve the symptoms. Patients on high doses should be regularly monitored for ocular side effects. Other effects of niacin toxicity includes: Flushing: Caused by the release of prostaglandins leading to vasodilation. Gastrointestinal Distress: Nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and abdominal discomfort . Due to increased gastric acid secretion and irritation of the gastrointestinal lining. Hepatotoxicity Hyperglycemia Hyperurecemia Reference: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4458328/",

      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: A) Vitamin B1 injection followed by glucose infusion Explanation: This patient is presenting with symptoms of Wernicke's encephalopathy , commonly seen in patients with chronic alcoholism. The treatment for Wernicke's encephalopathy is to administer thiamine (vitamin B1) before or simultaneously with glucose to prevent exacerbating the condition. WERNICKE-KORSAKOFF SYNDROME (CEREBRAL BERI-BERI) Clinical Manifestations Wernicke Encephalopathy: Symptoms: Ophthalmoplegia, nystagmus, cerebellar ataxia, global confusion. Korsakoff Psychosis: Symptoms: Anterograde and retrograde amnesia, sensory agnosia, and confabulation. (Option B) Causes of Thiamine Deficiency in Alcoholics Increased thiamine requirements due to alcohol consumption. Alcohol is a source of empty calories. Inhibition of intestinal thiamine absorption by alcohol. Metabolic Implications Impaired conversion of pyruvate to acetyl-CoA. Accumulation of pyruvate and lactate in the blood. Potential for life-threatening lactic acidosis. Progression and Risk Factors Progression from Wernicke encephalopathy to Korsakoff psychosis if untreated. Associated with severely compromised nutritional status, often due to chronic alcoholism. MRI findings Symmetrical T2/FLAIR signal increase in the mammillary bodies, dorsomedial thalami, tectal plate, periaqueductal area, and around the third ventricle. Treatment Acute Phase (Wernicke Encephalopathy) : Intravenous thiamine (100 mg) for 3-7 days is standard; however, higher doses (500 mg TID) may be required if symptoms persist. Glucose should be administered after thiamine to prevent exacerbating symptoms. Chronic Phase (Korsakoff’s Psychosis) : Continue oral thiamine indefinitely, especially in alcohol-dependent patients. Address co-occurring deficiencies , provide nutritional support , and consider rehabilitation or residential care if needed. Glucose infusion followed by thiamine injection (Option B): Giving glucose before thiamine can exacerbate Wernicke’s encephalopathy, as it can increase the metabolic demand for thiamine, worsening the deficiency. Glucose infusion alone (Option C): Glucose infusion without thiamine can precipitate or worsen Wernicke's encephalopathy in patients with thiamine deficiency (such as in chronic alcoholics). Thiamine infusion alone (Option D): While thiamine is essential, glucose infusion is also necessary if the patient is hypoglycemic. Thiamine alone is insufficient for immediate management if glucose is needed for the patient’s energy requirements.

Requirements : The daily recommended intake is 75 mg/day, increased to 100 mg/day during pregnancy, lactation, for the elderly, smokers, and those on oral contraceptives. Scurvy : Vitamin C deficiency leads to scurvy, which can be severe in infants between 6–12 months (infantile scurvy or Barlow’s disease). Hemorrhagic Tendency : Collagen is abnormal in vitamin C deficiency, causing fragile capillaries that lead to bleeding under pressure, seen as petechiae or ecchymoses. Internal Hemorrhage : Severe deficiency may cause hemorrhages in the conjunctiva, retina, nose (epistaxis), urine (hematuria), and stools (melena). Oral Cavity : Severe scurvy causes swollen, painful gums, and tooth loss due to separation of pulp from dentine. Wound healing is delayed. Bones : Vitamin C deficiency weakens bones, leading to fractures, joint hemorrhage, and pain due to failure of osteoblasts to form osteoid.",

It is crucial for maintaining healthy hair, skin, and nails. Effect of Raw Egg Consumption: Raw egg whites contain avidin, a protein that binds to biotin with high affinity, preventing its absorption in the gut. Chronic consumption of raw eggs can lead to biotin deficiency, causing: Thinning of hair (alopecia). Scaling of the scalp and other skin lesions. Neurological symptoms like depression, lethargy, and paresthesia (in severe cases). Niacin (Option A): Niacin (vitamin B3) deficiency causes pellagra , characterized by the \"3 Ds\": dermatitis, diarrhea, and dementia . Hair thinning and scalp scaling are not typical features. Pyridoxine (Option B): Pyridoxine (vitamin B6) deficiency can cause seborrheic dermatitis, irritability, and peripheral neuropathy, but it is not specifically linked to raw egg consumption. Thiamine (Option D): Thiamine (vitamin B1) deficiency leads to beriberi or Wernicke-Korsakoff syndrome , which primarily affects the cardiovascular and nervous systems, not hair or scalp health.

Methanol poisoning causes formation of Formate ions . Acids formed lead to defective mitochondria and lactic acidosis, which increase AG. Increase in plasma osmolality. Osmolal gap is also seen Methanol, also known as wood alcohol, is a CNS depressant often found in illicit liquors. It is highly toxic. Methanol toxicity is infamous for causing metabolic acidosis and optic nerve damage, leading to snowfield vision and potential blindness. Methanol Poisoning: Metabolism and Pathophysiology: Methanol → Formaldehyde (via alcohol dehydrogenase). Formaldehyde → Formic acid (via aldehyde dehydrogenase). Formic acid leads to: Metabolic acidosis. Retinal damage (optic neuritis). Symptoms: Early: Severe abdominal cramps. Neurological: Snowfield vision, vision loss, dilated and fixed pupils, muscular weakness . Systemic: CNS and cardiac depression. Treatment: Stabilization: Immediate supportive care. Hemodialysis: To remove methanol and formic acid. Antidotes: Ethanol: Competes with methanol for alcohol dehydrogenase. Fomepizole: Inhibits alcohol dehydrogenase. Other Therapies: Folinic acid: Enhances formic acid metabolism. Sodium bicarbonate: Treats acidosis. Glycolic acid and oxalic acid (Option A,C,D) is mainly formed in ethylene glycol poisoning Postmortem Findings: Putamen hemorrhagic necrosis (specific finding). Absence of postmortem clotting.

      "question": "Which vitamin acts as a coenzyme required for Glucose-6-Phosphate Dehydrogenase (G6PD)?",
      "options": {
        "A": "Riboflavin",
        "B": "Thiamine",
        "C": "Niacin",
        "D": "Biotin"
      },
      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: C) Niacin Explanation Niacin, in the form of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADP+), is required as a coenzyme for G6PD. This enzyme catalyzes the first step of the pentose phosphate pathway, producing NADPH, which is essential for reductive biosynthesis and maintaining reduced glutathione in cells. Niacin (Vitamin B3) Chemical Structure Niacin : Pyridine-3-carboxylic acid. Niacinamide : Acid amide derivative. Active tissue form: Niacinamide Coenzyme Forms and Functions NAD+ : Generates 2.5 ATPs in oxidative phosphorylation. NADPH : Used in reductive biosynthesis (e.g., fatty acid synthesis). Provides ADP-ribose for protein modification (ADP-ribosylation). Synthesis and Metabolism 60 mg of tryptophan = 1 mg niacin (requires pyridoxal phosphate-dependent kynureninase). Niacin attaches to ribose phosphate, forming a mononucleotide, then combines with AMP to form dinucleotides. Deficiency Causes Dietary Deficiency: Staple diets like maize (bound niacin) or sorghum (leucine inhibits niacin conversion). Enzyme Defects: Pyridoxal deficiency inhibits kynureninase activity. Drugs: Isoniazid inhibits pyridoxal phosphate formation. Congenital Disorders: Hartnup disease (impaired tryptophan absorption and increased urinary excretion). Carcinoid Syndrome : Excess tryptophan used for serotonin synthesis. Clinical Condition Pellagra : Niacin or tryptophan deficiency causing \"rough skin\". Symptoms (3 Ds): Dermatitis (Casal’s necklace), Diarrhea (may involve blood/mucus), Dementia (irritability, poor memory, delirium). Sources Richest: Dried yeast, rice , liver, peanuts, cereals, legumes, meat, fish. 50% requirement met by tryptophan conversion. RDA Adults : 20 mg/day ; Additional 5 mg during lactation. Therapeutic Uses Lowers serum cholesterol and Lp(a) by reducing free fatty acid flux from adipose tissue. Toxicity Excess (>50 mg/day): Vasodilation, itching, liver damage. Riboflavin (Option A): Riboflavin is a precursor for flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD) and flavin mononucleotide (FMN), which are coenzymes in redox reactions. However, these are not directly involved with G6PD activity. Thiamine (Option B): Thiamine, as thiamine pyrophosphate (TPP), is a coenzyme for enzymes involved in carbohydrate metabolism, such as pyruvate dehydrogenase and transketolase, but not for G6PD. Biotin (Option D): Biotin serves as a coenzyme for carboxylase enzymes involved in carboxylation reactions, such as pyruvate carboxylase, but not for G6PD.

      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "deficiency. Folate deficiency typically causes megaloblastic anemia, characterized by the presence of large, immature red blood cells. Hemolytic anemia involves the destruction of red blood cells and is not directly related to folate deficiency. Incorrect Options: Option B - High Homocysteine and Normal Methylmalonic Acid: In folate deficiency, homocysteine levels are elevated because folate is necessary for its conversion to methionine. However, methylmalonic acid levels remain normal because MMA accumulation is specifically associated with vitamin B12 deficiency. Option A - Folate supplementation in pregnancy prevents NTD : Folate, also known as folic acid when it's in its synthetic form, is crucial during pregnancy for preventing neural tube defects (NTDs) in the developing fetus. Option D - Treat coexisting B12 deficiency before initiating folate therapy : B12 deficiency indirectly causes folate deficiency. It's important to treat coexisting B12 deficiency before initiating folate therapy. Folate supplementation can improve the production of red blood cells, which may mask the anemia symptoms of B12 deficiency. This can lead to a delay in diagnosing and treating the underlying B12 deficiency, which, if left untreated, can cause irreversible nerve damage. Reference: .",

        "D": "Tyrosinase"
      },
      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: C) Methylcobalamin (Vitamin B12) deficiency Explanation: Vitamin B12 deficiency can lead to neurological symptoms such as gait abnormalities, confusion, and agitation. It often causes a condition known as Subacute Combined Degeneration (SACD) of the spinal cord. This condition includes: Sensory neuropathy: Tingling and numbness in the extremities. Motor neuropathy: Weakness and gait disturbances. Cranial nerve involvement: Potentially affecting cognitive functions and causing confusion. Features of Chronic Alcoholism Vit. B12 Deficiency (Option C) Chronic alcohol use can lead to functional vitamin B12 deficiency, even if blood tests show normal levels. Alcohol interferes with vitamin B12 absorption and metabolism. Vitamin B12 is essential for DNA synthesis and maintaining healthy nerves and red blood cells. Symptoms of B12 deficiency include fatigue, weakness, numbness, and balance problems. Alcohol can damage the liver, which might cause falsely high B12 levels in blood tests, making diagnosis challenging. Folate Deficiency (Option B ruled out) Folate (vitamin B9) deficiency is common in chronic alcoholics, affecting 6-80% of them. Alcohol disrupts folate by impairing its absorption, transport, and liver storage. Poor diet in alcoholics worsens folate deficiency. Folate is crucial for making red blood cells and DNA. Deficiency can cause megaloblastic anaemia and neurological issues like peripheral neuropathy and cognitive problems. Hypoglycemia Chronic alcohol consumption can cause low blood sugar (hypoglycemia), especially if not eating enough. Alcohol produces a high NADH/NAD+ ratio in the cytoplasm, the high NADH level favours the conversion of pyruvate to lactate, leading to lactic acidosis. Deficiency of pyruvate leads to inadequate formationof oxaloacetate which blocks gluconeogenesis This results in low blood sugar levels. Symptoms of alcohol-induced hypoglycemia include confusion, irritability, and, in severe cases, loss of consciousness. Nicotinamide (Vitamin B3) Deficiency (Option A): Deficiency in Vitamin B3 can lead to pellagra, characterized by the \"three D's\": dermatitis, diarrhea, and dementia. Tyrosinase (Option D): Tyrosinase is an enzyme involved in melanin production, not a vitamin. It is not related to the symptoms described.

Ocular manifestations : Vitamin A deficiency is the most significant preventable cause of blindness, especially in children below 5 in developing countries. Early Signs: Loss of sensitivity to green light. Difficulty adapting to dim light. Night blindness. Prolonged Deficiency: Xerophthalmia: Dry, thick, keratinized conjunctiva and cornea. If untreated, it leads to corneal ulceration and ultimately results in blindness due to the formation of opaque scar tissue. WHO grading of xerophthalmia: XN Night blindness. X1 X1A: Conjunctival xerosis. X1B: Bitot spots. X2 Corneal xerosis. X3 X3A: Corneal ulceration, less than one-third. X3B: Corneal ulceration, more than one-third. XS Corneal scar. XF Xerophthalmic fundus. Bitot's Spots: Grayish-white triangular plaques firmly adherent to the conjunctiva. Keratomalacia: When xerophthalmia persists for a longer time, it progresses to keratomalacia (corneal softening) 2) Immune Function: Deficiency increases susceptibility to infections. Infection reduces retinol-binding protein synthesis, lowering vitamin A levels and impairing immune responses. 3) Skin and Mucous Membrane Lesions: Follicular Hyperkeratosis (Phrynoderma): Causes rough skin due to hyperkeratinization of the follicular epithelium. Keratinizing Metaplasia: Affects respiratory, gastrointestinal, and genitourinary tracts. Epithelium is atrophied. 4) Other General Manifestation : Growth retardation due to defective synthesis of chondroitin sulfate. Decreased protein synthesis. Beri-beri (Option A) is a condition caused by thiamine (vitamin B1) deficiency lead to symptoms such as muscle weakness, peripheral neuropathy, cardiovascular problems, and impaired mental function. Pellagra (Option B) is a condition caused by niacin (vitamin B3) deficiency causes Pellagra is characterized by the \"4 Ds\" - dermatitis (skin inflammation), diarrhea, dementia (mental confusion), and death if left untreated. Neuropathy (Option D) refers to nerve damage, which can have various causes, such as diabetes, alcohol abuse, certain medications, and vitamin deficiencies.

      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: B) Thiamine-transketolase Explanation: The Aleurone layer of cereals (food grains) is a rich source of thiamine . Therefore, whole wheat flour and unpolished hand-pound rice have better nutritive value than completely polished refined foods. When the grains are polished, the aleurone layer is usually removed. Biochemical parameters: Thiamine deficiency affects the enzyme transketolase , which is involved in the pentose phosphate pathway. Measuring transketolase activity in red blood cells is a specific test for thiamine deficiency and can confirm the diagnosis. Erythrocyte transketolase activity is reduced; this is the earliest manifestation seen even before clinical disturbances. Recommended Daily Allowance of Thiamine is 1–1.5 mg/day. Riboflavin-glutathione reductase (Option A) Riboflavin (vitamin B2) deficiency affects glutathione reductase, an enzyme involved in maintaining cellular redox balance by regenerating reduced glutathione. Polished rice is not specifically deficient in riboflavin, so this combination is unlikely. Thiamine-transaminase (Option C) Transaminases (e.g., ALT, AST) are not thiamine-dependent enzymes; they require pyridoxal phosphate (vitamin B6) as a cofactor.

Maize lacks adequate niacin and tryptophan (a precursor of niacin), predisposing individuals to pellagra when consumed as a staple without proper processing or supplementation. Niacin (Vitamin B3) Chemical Structure Niacin : Pyridine-3-carboxylic acid. Niacinamide : Acid amide derivative. Active tissue form: Niacinamide Coenzyme Forms and Functions NAD+ : Generates 2.5 ATPs in oxidative phosphorylation. NADPH : Used in reductive biosynthesis (e.g., fatty acid synthesis). Provides ADP-ribose for protein modification (ADP-ribosylation). Synthesis and Metabolism 60 mg of tryptophan = 1 mg niacin (requires pyridoxal phosphate-dependent kynureninase). Niacin attaches to ribose phosphate, forming a mononucleotide, then combines with AMP to form dinucleotides. Deficiency Causes Dietary Deficiency: Staple diets like maize (bound niacin) or sorghum (leucine inhibits niacin conversion). Enzyme Defects: Pyridoxal",
