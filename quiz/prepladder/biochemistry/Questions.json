Folding of over half of mammalian proteins is done by chaperones which can be divided into two types: The hsp70 (70-kDa heat shock protein) family of chaperones mainly binds short sequences of hydrophobic amino acids to shield them from solvents in newly synthesized polypeptides. These are produced in response to stress conditions. Chaperonins are another type of chaperone that form large protein complexes that provide a protective environment for the folding of the newly synthesized protein. Chaperones provide an opportunity to form appropriate secondary structural elements and their subsequent coalescence into a molten globule, thus preventing aggregation.

      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: C) Aß2m Explanation: Hemodialysis-associated amyloidosis is caused by the accumulation of β 2-microglobulin (A β 2M) in tissues, particularly in osteoarticular tissue, the gastrointestinal tract, and the circulatory system. β 2-microglobulin is a small protein that accumulates in the blood during long-term hemodialysis, as it is not easily filtered by conventional dialysis membranes. Over time, this leads to the formation of amyloid deposits, which can cause joint pain, stiffness, and other complications in patients undergoing long-term dialysis.

      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: C) Protein folding Explanation: Chaperones are proteins that assist in the correct folding of other proteins. When a protein is synthesized, it may adopt various three-dimensional structures, and only one of these structures will have biological activity. Chaperones prevent the incorrect folding of proteins and ensure they achieve the correct structure necessary for proper function. They are crucial in the assembly of tertiary and quaternary protein structures. Chaperones, such as heat shock proteins (HSPs), are also produced in response to stress, including heat, toxins, or radiation, and help in maintaining protein integrity under these conditions. Misfolded proteins can lead to diseases, including prion diseases and chaperonopathies. Incorrect Options: Ubiquitinization of proteins (Option A): Ubiquitinization refers to the process where a small protein called ubiquitin is attached to other proteins, typically marking them for degradation by the proteasome. This is unrelated to the function of chaperones, which focus on helping proteins fold correctly, not tagging them for destruction. Protein modification (Option B) involves chemical changes to a protein after its synthesis, such as phosphorylation, glycosylation, or acetylation. While chaperones help proteins fold correctly, they do not directly modify them in terms of adding chemical groups or altering their structure after they are fully folded. Protein cleavage (Option D) is the process of breaking down proteins into smaller peptides, often by enzymes like proteases. This process is not related to the role of chaperones, which help proteins fold into their correct structures rather than breaking them down or cleaving them into smaller parts.

      },
      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: A) Tertiary structure is three-dimensional Explanation: The tertiary structure represents the overall three-dimensional folding of a single polypeptide chain. It is stabilized by interactions like hydrogen bonds, ionic bonds, hydrophobic interactions, and disulfide bridges. Functionality : The tertiary structure is crucial for the biological activity of the protein, as it determines the placement of active sites, binding sites, and interaction regions. This makes the three-dimensional nature of tertiary structure a key feature in protein organization. Incorrect Options: Primary, secondary, and tertiary structures are destroyed by denaturation (Option B): Denaturation affects only the secondary, tertiary, and quaternary structures, leaving the primary structure (amino acid sequence) intact. The secondary structure is stabilized by disulfide bonds (Option C): The secondary structure (e.g., α -helices and β -sheets) is primarily stabilized by hydrogen bonds between the carbonyl oxygen and amide hydrogen of the polypeptide backbone. The secondary and tertiary structure depends upon amino acid sequence (Option D): The amino acid sequence (primary structure) dictates how the protein folds into its secondary and tertiary structures, but this does not directly address the structural organization.

Proteasomes are large protein complexes found in cells that are responsible for protein degradation. They play a vital role in maintaining cellular homeostasis by selectively breaking down proteins that are damaged, misfolded, or no longer needed. Proteasomes consist of multiple subunits that work together to recognize and degrade target proteins. The main function of proteasomes is to break down proteins into smaller peptide fragments, which can then be further processed and recycled by the cell. The degradation of proteins by proteasomes is essential for various cellular processes, including the regulation of cell cycle progression, removal of misfolded or damaged proteins, antigen presentation in the immune system and control of protein levels and turnover.

      "correct_answer": "D",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: D) Tryptophan Explanation: Tryptophan has a strong UV absorbance at 280 nm due to its aromatic side chain. Replacing alanine (which has low absorbance at 280 nm) with tryptophan will significantly increase the protein’s UV absorbance at this wavelength. Tryptophan is non polar, hydrophobic and aromatic amino acid. Involved in protein synthesis and neurotransmitter synthesis. Absorption of UV light at different wavelengths: At 280nm: Aromatic amino acids like tryptophan and phenylalanine At 260nm: Purines and pyrimidines Incorrect Options: Leucine (Option A ): Leucine is also a non-aromatic amino acid and does not significantly contribute to UV absorbance at 280nm. Proline (Option B): Proline is an imino acid and absorbs UV light at 260nm. Therefore, it would not increase the UV absorbance at 280nm wavelength.

      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: C) Moving pH away from isoelectric pH Explanation: At the isoelectric pH, proteins are least soluble because they have no net charge. This results in minimal repulsion between molecules, causing them to aggregate and precipitate. Hence, high solubility is not a characteristic of the isoelectric pH. Add alcohol and acetone (Option A) Alkaloidal reagents are negatively charged. In an acidic medium, proteins are positively charged. So, by neutralization of charges, negative ion precipitates out. Using heavy metals and ion (Option B) Neutralisation of charges occur which lead to precipitation of positive ion as heavy metals are positively charged. Adding trichloroacetic acid (Option D) It is negatively charged. In an acidic medium, proteins are positively charged. So, neutralization of charges occurs and the negative ion is separated.

      "explanation": "production of oxaloacetate through transamination reactions in the citric acid cycle. Aspartic Acid (Aspartate): Isolation and Characteristics: Aspartic acid (Asp) was first isolated by Kreusler in 1869. It is a non-essential, glucogenic amino acid, meaning it can be synthesized by the body and can be converted to glucose. Transamination and TCA Cycle : Aspartate undergoes transamination to produce oxaloacetate, a key intermediate that initiates the TCA (Krebs) cycle. The enzyme Aspartate Aminotransferase (AST), which requires PLP (pyridoxal phosphate) as a coenzyme, transfers the amino group of aspartate to α -ketoglutarate, forming oxaloacetate and glutamate. Reaction: Aspartate+ α -Ketoglutarate → AST/PLPOxaloacetate+Glutamate Clinical Significance of AST: AST levels are clinically important: Elevated AST is seen in conditions like cardiac ischemia and hepatic diseases (such as liver damage or hepatitis). Malate-Aspartate Shuttle: Transfers cytoplasmic NADH into the mitochondria for oxidation in the electron transport chain, contributing to ATP production. Role in the Urea Cycle: Donating its alpha-amino group to form urea, which is excreted in urine. Glucogenic Pathway: The carbon skeleton of aspartate can also be converted to fumarate, which enters the glucogenic pathway, contributing to glucose synthesis. Reaction: Citrulline+Aspartate → Arginine+Fumarate Synthesis of Purines and Pyrimidines: Synthesis of purines: contributing the 1st nitrogen and 6th NH2 group. Pyrimidine synthesis: Its entire structure is incorporated into the pyrimidine ring, contributing the 1st nitrogen and carbons 4, 5, 6. Alanine (Option A) can be involved in the glucose-alanine cycle and can be converted into pyruvate, not oxaloacetate. Lysine (Option B) is an essential amino acid, and it is not directly involved in the synthesis of oxaloacetate. Leucine (Option C) is also not directly involved in the synthesis of oxaloacetate. It is primarily involved in protein synthesis and can be catabolized to generate acetyl-CoA, which can then enter the citric acid cycle. Reference: Vasudevan Edition 7 page no:226",

Ammonia Management in Neurons: Ammonia can be neurotoxic if accumulated. Glutamine Synthesis: Produced in neurons as a byproduct of amino acid metabolism and neurotransmitter turnover. Ammonia reacts with α -ketoglutarate and NADH to form glutamate, catalyzed by glutamate dehydrogenase. α -ketoglutarate + NH 3 I I + NADH → Glutamate + NAD + + H2 I O Glutamate is converted to glutamine by glutamine synthetase, adding another ammonia molecule. Glutamine synthetase is predominantly found in astrocytes. Glutamate + NH 3 I + ATP → Glutamine + ADP + Pi This conversion reduces ammonia toxicity by storing it in a non-toxic form. (Option A ruled out) The fate of glutamine: Release into the Bloodstream: Glutamine is released into the extracellular space and enters the bloodstream. This transport helps maintain nitrogen balance and prevents ammonia accumulation. Transport to the Liver: Glutamine carries ammonia from the brain to the liver, where it is deaminated to release ammonia. Ammonia enters the urea cycle in the liver for detoxification. Importance of Glutamine in Neuronal Health: Acts as a non-toxic ammonia carrier, preventing neurotoxicity. Serves as a precursor for neurotransmitters like GABA , maintaining neurotransmitter balance.

      "explanation": "cell anemia, a single-point mutation in the beta-globin gene causes glutamic acid to be substituted with valine at the 6th position of the beta-globin chain Pathophysiology of Sickle cell anemia: HbS Polymerisation: (Option B) A single-nucleotide polymorphism in the β -globin gene results in the substitution of valine for glutamic acid at the sixth position in the β -globin chain. This mutation leads to the formation of mutated hemoglobin (HbS). After deoxygenation, HbS molecules polymerize to form bundles. These polymer bundles cause erythrocytes to adopt a sickle shape and also promote hemolysis of erythrocyte, releasing cell-free Hb into circulation. IIIIIII Vaso-occlusion: Sickled erythrocytes impair blood flow and aggregate with neutrophils, platelets, and endothelial cells, causing stasis. Leads to ischemia-reperfusion (I-R) injury. Endothelial Dysfunction: Oxygenated Hb (Fe² I ) depletes endothelial nitric oxide (NO), forming nitrate (NO II ) and methemoglobin (Fe³ I ). Free radicals are generated by NADPH oxidase, xanthine oxidase (XO), and uncoupled endothelial NO synthase (eNOS) contribute to endothelial damage and dysfunction. Methemoglobin (Fe³ I ) breaks down, releasing cell-free heme, which is a major erythrocyte damage-associated molecular pattern (DAMP). Sterile Inflammation: Cell-free heme or ischemia-reperfusion injury triggers sterile inflammation by: Generating reactive oxygen species (ROS). Activating Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4). Inducing neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs). Releasing DAMPs, DNA, and other unidentified factors. This activates the inflammasome pathway, releasing IL-1 β . Sterile inflammation enhances the adhesiveness of neutrophils, platelets, and endothelial cells. This creates a cycle that promotes further vaso-occlusion.

Prevent Misfolding: Chaperones prevent incorrect interactions between amino acid residues during protein synthesis or stress conditions (e.g., heat shock). Assist Refolding: In cases where proteins lose their structure due to stress (like heat shock or chemical damage), chaperones help refold them. Types of Chaperones: Heat shock proteins (HSPs): Act during stress (e.g., Hsp70, Hsp90). Chaperonins (e.g., GroEL-GroES complex): Create a safe environment for folding inside a barrel-like structure. Energy Dependency: Many chaperones require ATP for their function, especially during binding and release cycles (e.g., Hsp70). Reference: Chaperones",

      "explanation": "Correct Answer A - Human cells can divide a finite number of times only. : The hayflick limit , discovered by Dr. Leonard Hayflick, states that normal human cells have a finite capacity for replication. Telomeres, protective caps at chromosome ends, shorten with each cell division due to incomplete DNA replication. Shortened telomeres eventually lead to cellular senescence, preventing uncontrolled cell division and potential cancer. Some cells, like stem cells and certain cancers, express telomerase, extending telomeres and bypassing the Hayflick limit. In normal human cells, telomerase activity is limited, leading to replicative senescence. The Hayflick limit , the maximum times cells can divide, is influenced by several factors: Telomere Length: Shortening telomeres indicate reduced division capacity. Telomerase Activity: Higher activity extends telomeres, bypassing the limit. DNA Damage: Accumulated damage triggers senescence, limiting division. Cellular Stress: Various stressors accelerate senescence, reducing the limit. Genetic Factors: Variations affect telomere maintenance and DNA repair. Environmental Factors: Lifestyle, pollutants, and stress impact cellular health, affecting the limit. Free radical oxidation level is unrestricted (Option B): The Hayflick limit is not directly related to free radical oxidation levels. Telomerase activity is unrestricted (Option C): Telomerase activity is typically restricted in normal human cells, unlike stem cells and certain cancers. RNA polymerase can function for a finite number of times only (Option D): The Hayflick limit primarily involves telomere shortening, not RNA polymerase function. Reference: Hayflick limit",

      "question": "A female patient presented with pain and redness in the great toe. The serum uric acid level is 9.4mg/dl. The physician prescribed a drug for the treatment. Which of the following enzyme is likely to be inhibited by this drug?",
      "options": {
        "A": "Phosphoribosyl transferase",
        "B": "Thymidylate synthase",
        "C": "Xanthine oxidase",
        "D": "Dihydrofolate reductase"
      },
      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: C) Xanthine oxidase Explanation: The clinical scenario describes a female patient with pain and redness in the great toe, which suggests gout, a condition caused by elevated uric acid levels. The patient's serum uric acid level of 9.4 mg/dl is above the normal range, indicating hyperuricemia, which can lead to the formation of uric acid crystals in the joints, causing pain and inflammation. The physician has prescribed a drug that helps manage gout by reducing uric acid levels. The drug prescribed is allopurinol, which is known to inhibit xanthine oxidase, the enzyme responsible for converting hypoxanthine to xanthine and xanthine to uric acid. By inhibiting xanthine oxidase, allopurinol decreases the production of uric acid, effectively managing gout by lowering uric acid levels in the body. Incorrect Options: Phosphoribosyl transferase (Option A): Involved in purine metabolism, but not the target of allopurinol. Thymidylate synthase (Option B): Involved in DNA synthesis, not related to gout treatment. Dihydrofolate reductase (Option D): Involved in folate metabolism, and inhibited by drugs like methotrexate, not relevant to gout treatment.
