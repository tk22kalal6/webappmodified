      "question": "A patient presents with a history of vomiting. Arterial blood gas analysis reveals the following: pH : 7.5 pCO I : 48 mm Hg HCO II : 30 mm Hg What is the most likely acid-base abnormality?",
      "options": {
        "A": "Metabolic alkalosis",
        "B": "Metabolic acidosis",
        "C": "Respiratory acidosis",
        "D": "Respiratory alkalosis"
      },
      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "(Alkalosis) pCO I : 48 mmHg (Elevated) HCO II : 30 mEq/L (Elevated) These findings suggest a primary metabolic alkalosis with respiratory compensation . Primary Mechanism: Vomiting leads to loss of gastric HCl , causing an increase in bicarbonate (HCO II ) and resulting in metabolic alkalosis. Compensatory Mechanism: The body attempts to retain CO I via hypoventilation (elevated pCO I ) to counteract the alkalosis. Metabolic Acidosis (Option B) is incorrect because metabolic acidosis would present with a low pH (<7.35) and a low HCO II , which is not the case here. Respiratory Acidosis (Option C) is incorrect because respiratory acidosis is characterized by low pH and high pCO I , but in this case, the pH is elevated. Respiratory Alkalosis (Option D) is incorrect because respiratory alkalosis involves low pCO I due to hyperventilation, whereas this patient has elevated pCO I as a compensatory response.

      "question": "Which of the following enzymes is typically elevated in prostate cancer?",
      "options": {
        "A": "Acid phosphatase",
        "B": "Alkaline phosphatase",
        "C": "Lactate dehydrogenase",
        "D": "Alpha-fetoprotein"
      },
      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "phosphatase (PAP) , is an enzyme that is elevated in prostate cancer , particularly in advanced or metastatic cases . PAP was historically used as a tumour marker for prostate cancer , though prostate-specific antigen (PSA) is now the preferred marker. Significance: Elevated in prostate cancer with bone metastases Can be used to monitor disease progression Less commonly used now due to the superior sensitivity of PSA Alkaline Phosphatase (Option B) is incorrect because while alkaline phosphatase (ALP) is elevated in bone metastases , it is not specific for prostate cancer and can also be seen in liver disease and bone disorders. Lactate Dehydrogenase (Option C) is incorrect because LDH is a non-specific marker of cell turnover and is elevated in various malignancies, not just prostate cancer. Alpha-Fetoprotein (Option D) is incorrect because AFP is primarily a marker for hepatocellular carcinoma and germ cell tumours , not prostate cancer.

      "question": "The development of cataracts in patients with Diabetes Mellitus is primarily due to the accumulation of which of the following substances in the lens?",
      "options": {
        "A": "Sorbitol",
        "B": "Dulcitol",
        "C": "Mannitol",
        "D": "Galactitol"
      },
      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "cataracts . In diabetes mellitus , chronic hyperglycaemia leads to the activation of the polyol pathway , where: Glucose is converted to sorbitol by aldose reductase . Sorbitol is slowly metabolised to fructose by sorbitol dehydrogenase . In the lens, sorbitol accumulates , causing: Osmotic stress → water influx → lens swelling Oxidative stress → protein damage → cataract formation Diabetic cataracts typically present as snowflake cataracts in younger individuals or as accelerated senile cataracts . Dulcitol (Option B) is incorrect because dulcitol (galactitol) accumulates in galactosemia , not diabetes. It causes galactose-induced cataracts due to galactokinase or GALT deficiency . Mannitol (Option C) is incorrect because mannitol is an exogenous osmotic diuretic and does not accumulate in the lens. Galactitol (Option D) is incorrect because it is another name for dulcitol , and its accumulation is linked to galactosemia , not diabetes.

      "explanation": "for newborn screening for metabolic disorders. It allows for the detection of multiple metabolic diseases from a single blood sample. It is highly sensitive and can identify various metabolic abnormalities by analyzing specific metabolites and their precursors. Incorrect Options: Option B - Complete blood count (CBC): CBC is a common blood test used to evaluate overall health and detect a wide range of disorders, including anemia, infection, and many other diseases. However, it is not specifically designed for metabolic disease screening. Option C - Urinalysis: Useful for evaluating kidney function and urinary tract issues but not comprehensive enough for metabolic disease screening Option D - Genetic testing: Identifies specific genetic mutations, often used when there is a high suspicion of a particular disorder, but not a first-line screening tool due to cost and specificity.

        "C": "Glycine",
        "D": "Lysine"
      },
      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: A) L-arginine Explanation: Nitric oxide (NO I ) is a highly reactive free radical with an unpaired electron, making it highly reactive. It is uncharged and has a short half-life (approximately 0.1 second). Synthesis of Nitric Oxide : NO I is synthesized from arginine by the enzyme nitric oxide synthase (NOS) . NOS contains heme , FAD , FMN , and tetrahydrobiopterine . The process utilizes NADPH and molecular oxygen . Calmodulin is required to modulate NOS activity. The guanidino nitrogen of arginine is incorporated into NO I , while one oxygen atom from molecular oxygen is incorporated into NO I and the other into citrulline . This makes NOS a di-oxygenase enzyme. Isoenzymes of NOS : Mechanism of Action of Nitric Oxide : NO I diffuses to adjacent smooth muscle cells and activates guanylate cyclase . This leads to an increase in cyclic GMP levels, which activates protein kinase in smooth muscle. This causes the dephosphorylation of myosin light chains , resulting in relaxation of smooth muscle (vasodilation) in blood vessels, leading to lower blood pressure . L-citrulline (Option B) : L-citrulline is a byproduct of nitric oxide synthesis, as it is produced from L-arginine during the enzymatic conversion to NO I . It is not the direct precursor for nitric oxide. Glycine (Option C) : Glycine is an amino acid, but it is not involved in the synthesis of nitric oxide. It serves other functions in the body, such as being a neurotransmitter. Lysine (Option D) : L-lysine is another amino acid, but it does not play a direct role in the synthesis of nitric oxide.

        "D": "Gaucher's disease"
      },
      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: C) Tay-sachs disease Explanation: The child in the clinical scenario is showing signs of mental retardation, blindness, and muscle weakness , which strongly suggest a lysosomal storage disorder . Upon investigation, the child was found to be deficient in hexosaminidase A enzyme. The disease most likely causing these symptoms is Tay-Sachs disease .It is an inborn error of metabolism due to the failure of degradation of gangliosides, which is caused by a deficiency in the enzyme hexosaminidase A.

      "question": "In a 14-year-old male, a medical condition has been identified as a result of a defect in a gene responsible for DNA repair. The individual is experiencing increased pigmentation on the skin and is at a heightened risk of developing skin cancers, according to the physician. Which of the following mechanisms is most likely to be impaired in this particular condition?",
      "options": {
        "A": "Nonhomologous end joining repair defect",
        "B": "Nucleotide excision repair defect",
        "C": "DNA base excision repair defect",
        "D": "DNA mismatch repair defect"
      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: B) Nucleotide excision repair defect Explanation: In this 14-year-old male, the condition described involves increased pigmentation on the skin and a heightened risk of skin cancers. These symptoms are consistent with Xeroderma Pigmentosum (XP) , a disorder caused by an inability to repair UV-induced DNA damage. UV radiation can cause the formation of pyrimidine dimers (thymine dimers) in the skin cells, which, if not repaired, lead to mutations and an increased risk of cancer. The key defective mechanism in XP is Nucleotide Excision Repair (NER) . Nucleotide excision repair: Nucleotide excision repair is required when chemical damage to a segment occurs. UV mediated Pyr Pyr dimerization is observed in a segment. 30 bases are removed and then the correct bases are added Recognition and Excision: In bacteria, UvrABC proteins (uvrABC excinuclease) recognize these dimers and cleave the damaged strand on both the 5 ′ and 3 ′ sides of the lesion. A short oligonucleotide containing the dimer is excised, leaving a gap in the DNA strand. The gap is subsequently filled in by DNA polymerase I and sealed by DNA ligase. Nucleotide Excision Repair in Humans: A related nucleotide excision repair (NER) pathway exists in humans, addressing UV-induced damage encountered during DNA synthesis. Transcription-coupled repair, a type of NER, specifically targets lesions that obstruct RNA synthesis. Clinical application: Pyrimidine dimers can form in human skin cells exposed to unfiltered sunlight. In xeroderma pigmentosum (XP), a genetic disorder, the inability to repair UV-induced DNA damage leads to the accumulation of mutations and a heightened risk of developing early and multiple skin cancers. XP results from defects in genes coding for proteins necessary for NER of UV damage",

      "question": "Nitrogenous waste is excreted from the body in the form of?",
      "options": {
        "A": "Urea",
        "B": "Nitric oxide",
        "C": "Ammonia",
        "D": "Glutamine"
      },
      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: A) Urea Explanation: Ammonia is produced during the breakdown of amino acids and by gut bacteria in humans. However, ammonia is highly toxic, especially to the brain, if its levels in the blood rise too high. To prevent this toxicity, the body converts ammonia into urea through the urea cycle . This process occurs in the liver, where ammonia is safely transformed into urea, a less toxic substance. Urea is then excreted from the body through the urine, effectively removing excess nitrogenous waste from the body. Incorrect Options: Nitric oxide (Option B): A signaling molecule involved in vasodilation and other processes, not nitrogenous waste excretion. Ammonia (Option C): While ammonia is produced during amino acid breakdown, it is toxic at high levels and is converted into urea for excretion. Glutamine (Option D): An amino acid involved in nitrogen transport but not directly excreted as a nitrogenous waste product. Reference: The Urea Cycle Step by Step",
