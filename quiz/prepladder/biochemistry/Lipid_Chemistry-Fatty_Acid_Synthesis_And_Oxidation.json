      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "the entry of long-chain acyl groups into the mitochondrial matrix The fate of fatty acid in the cell: Fatty acids (FAs) bind to membrane receptors and enter the cytoplasm via transporters. Fatty acyl CoA synthetase adds CoA to the fatty acids. Carnitine Palmitoyl Transferase 1A (CPT1A) converts fatty acyl CoA to acylcarnitine, which crosses the mitochondrial outer membrane. Inside the matrix, acylcarnitine exchanges with free carnitine through Carnitine Acyl Carnitine Transferase (CACT). Carnitine Palmitoyl Transferase 2 (CPT2) then converts acylcarnitine back to acyl-CoA esters. Regulation By CAT-I: Mobilized fatty acids enter mitochondria for beta-oxidation. Carnitine acyl transferase I (CAT-I) regulates this entry. In Low energy states: Conditions like diabetes and starvation, Glucagon levels increase. Increased glucagon decreases malonyl CoA levels. Reduced malonyl CoA levels lead to increased beta-oxidation in the mitochondria. In High energy states: Insulin levels are high. Increased insulin increases malonyl CoA levels. Increased malonyl CoA leads to decreased fatty acid oxidation Hence, Acyl CoA gets stored in the form of TAG in the cells Insulin and glucagon (Option A and B) do not directly influence CAT-1 but their levels indirectly influence it, by increasing or decreasing malonyl COA levels. ATP (Option D) does not directly regulate CAT-I activity.",

      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: A) 136, 134 Explanation: The oxidation of arachidonic acid occurs in the mitochondria via thiolysis when C2 units of it degrade once at a time to generate FADH2, NADH, and Acetyl-CoA. N = number of carbons in the fatty acid, here, N= 20 (Arachidonic acid is a 20C chain fatty acid) N/2 = of acetyl CoA produced N/2 – 1 = rounds need to fully metabolize the fatty acid, FADH2, NADH produced. Number of Acetyl-CoA produced = 20/2 = 10 Number of NADH and FADH2 produced = 20/2 —1 = 9 each. The 10 Acetyl-CoA then moves in the citrate cycle to produce 3 NADH, 1 FADH2, and 1 GTP per Acetyl-CoA. So, the number of NADH produced = 30, The number of FADH2 produced = 10 The number of GTP = 10. The ATP conversions: 1 GTP= 1 ATP 1 NADH = 2.5 ATP 1 FADH2= 1.5 ATP. The number of ATPs produced before the Acetyl-CoA moves in the citrate cycle= 9 FADH2 + 9 NADH = 9(1.5) + 9(2.5) = 36 ATPs The number of ATPs produced when the Acetyl-CoA moves in the citrate cycle. 30 NADH + 10 FADH2 + 1 GTP = 30(2.5) + 10(1.5) + 10(1) = 100 ATPs Total ATPs produced= 100 +36 = 136 2 equivalents of ATP (ATP I AMP +PPi) are used to activate fatty acids to make acyl-CoA; therefore the net yield is 2 fewer ATP molecules. The true yield is 134 ATP (136 − 2 ATP). Net ATPs produced=134 Reference: Harper Biochemistry, 32nd Edition, Page 220 Vasudevan Textbook of Biochemistry, 7th Edition, Page 153",

In vitamin B12 deficiency, the activity of methyl malonyl-CoA mutase is greatly reduced, leading to the accumulation of methyl malonyl-CoA and the subsequent excretion of methylmalonic acid in the urine ( methylmalonic aciduria ) and neurological side effects leading to mental retardation. Propionyl-CoA carboxylase (Option A) is another enzyme in the pathway that carboxylates propionyl-CoA to D-methylmalonyl-CoA and requires biotin, not vitamin B12. Methylmalonyl-CoA racemase (Option C) converts D-methylmalonyl-CoA to L-methylmalonyl-CoA, but this reaction also does not require vitamin B12.

      "options": {
        "A": "Glucagon decreases lipolysis and reduces ketogenesis.",
        "B": "Glucagon inhibits gluconeogenesis and promotes ketogenesis.",

        "D": "Glucagon decreases fatty acid entry into mitochondria and inhibits ketogenesis."
      },
      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "thereby stimulating ketogenesis. Causes of Ketosis: Diabetes Mellitus: Untreated diabetes mellitus causes ketosis due to insulin deficiency, which increases lipolysis and fatty acid oxidation. This raises acetyl CoA levels, while reduced oxaloacetate limits TCA cycle activity. The body then overproduces ketone bodies as it relies on fat metabolism for energy. Starvation: During starvation, reduced dietary glucose shifts oxaloacetate to gluconeogenesis. Increased lipolysis converts excess acetyl CoA to ketone bodies. High glucagon levels promote ketogenesis, providing the brain with 75% of its energy from ketones. Conditions like hyperemesis in early pregnancy can also cause ketosis. Limited glucose boosts free fatty acid mobilization, with the liver converting them to ketones, regulated by carnitine palmitoyltransferase-I (CPT-I). Explanation for Ketogenesis: Hormonal Regulation: Glucagon: Increases in glucagon during starvation and diabetes mellitus inhibit glycolysis, activate gluconeogenesis and lipolysis, decrease malonyl CoA, and stimulate ketogenesis. A high glucagon-insulin ratio promotes ketosis. Insulin: Opposes glucagon by favoring glycolysis, inhibiting gluconeogenesis, suppressing lipolysis, increasing malonyl CoA, and reducing ketogenesis. Regulation Levels of Ketone Body Formation: Lipolysis: Mobilizes fatty acids. Fatty Acid Entry to Mitochondria: Regulated by carnitine acyl transferase I (CAT-I) for beta-oxidation. Oxidation of Acetyl CoA: Converts acetyl CoA to ketone bodies. Glucagon decreases lipolysis and reduces ketogenesis. (Option A): Glucagon, in fact, increases lipolysis, which provides more fatty acids for ketogenesis. Glucagon inhibits gluconeogenesis and promotes ketogenesis. (Option B): Glucagon activates gluconeogenesis and also promotes ketogenesis, but it does not inhibit gluconeogenesis. Glucagon decreases fatty acid entry into mitochondria and inhibits ketogenesis. (Option D): Glucagon does not decrease fatty acid entry into mitochondria; rather, it promotes ketogenesis by increasing lipolysis and the availability of fatty acids.

      "explanation": "beta-oxidation of odd-chain fatty acids produces propionyl-CoA, which is then converted to succinyl-CoA. Beta Oxidation of Odd-Chain Fatty Acids Odd-chain fatty acids undergo beta-oxidation in the same manner as even-chain fatty acids, with successive removal of 2-carbon units (acetyl-CoA). The process continues until the final three-carbon unit, propionyl-CoA, remains. Fate of Propionyl-CoA Carboxylation : Propionyl-CoA is carboxylated to D-methylmalonyl-CoA by a biotin-dependent carboxylase enzyme, using ATP for energy. Racemization : D-methylmalonyl-CoA is then converted to L-methylmalonyl-CoA by a racemase enzyme. Rearrangement : L-methylmalonyl-CoA is rearranged to succinyl-CoA by L-methylmalonyl-CoA mutase, which requires vitamin B12.

(Option A ruled out) From Fatty Acids : Acetyl CoA is also a product of fatty acid β -oxidation within the mitochondria. Transport from Mitochondria to Cytoplasm: Citrate Shuttle : Acetyl CoA cannot readily cross the mitochondrial membrane. Instead, it combines with oxaloacetate to form citrate, which is transported to the cytoplasm via the tricarboxylate transporter.

Fates of Acetyl CoA: Fatty Acid Synthesis : Location : Cytoplasm. Process : Acetyl CoA is the primary building block for lipogenesis, regulated by nutritional status and more active in well-fed individuals consuming carbohydrate-rich diets. Cholesterol Synthesis : Precursor : Acetyl CoA is a precursor in cholesterol synthesis. Activity : This pathway is less active compared to fatty acid synthesis, especially in the liver. Energy Production : Citric Acid Cycle : Acetyl CoA can re-enter the mitochondria as citrate and participate in the citric acid cycle for ATP production. NADPH Production : Oxaloacetate in the cytoplasm can be converted to malate and then to pyruvate, generating NADPH in the process. Pyruvate returns to the mitochondria and is converted back into acetyl CoA. (Option D ruled out) Ketogenesis: Location : Liver mitochondria.

      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: A) Glucagon Explanation: Acetyl CoA Carboxylase is inhibited by Glucagon . Glucagon inhibits acetyl CoA carboxylase by keeping the enzyme in the inactive phosphorylated state. Glucagon is secreted when the energy charge is low and AMP levels are high. Acetyl CoA Carboxylase Stimulated by High energy level states Inhibited by Low energy level states. NADH (Option B ruled out) FADH2 ATP (Option C ruled out) Citrate Insulin: enhances the uptake of glucose by adipocytes and increases the activity of pyruvate dehydrogenase, acetyl CoA carboxylase, and glycerol phosphate acyl transferase (Option D ruled out) ADP NAD FAD Glucagon(catabolic hormone) (Option A) Acyl CoA Epinephrine The nutritional state of the organism is the main factor regulating the rate of lipogenesis Diets: Carbohydrate-rich diet: Increases lipogenesis Fat-rich diet: Decreases lipogenesis eg.
