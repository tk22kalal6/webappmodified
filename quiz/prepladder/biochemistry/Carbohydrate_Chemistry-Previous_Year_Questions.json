      "explanation": "brown adipose tissue. Unlike the other options, thermogenin does not inhibit oxidative phosphorylation. Instead, it creates a channel that allows the flow of protons (H+) across the inner mitochondrial membrane, bypassing ATP synthase. This uncoupling of proton gradient and ATP synthesis generates heat instead of ATP production Incorrect options: Option A . CO (Carbon Monoxide): Carbon monoxide is a potent inhibitor of oxidative phosphorylation. It binds to cytochrome c oxidase, a component of the electron transport chain, and prevents the transfer of electrons, thus inhibiting ATP synthesis. Option B . Antimycin A: Antimycin A is an antibiotic that specifically inhibits complex III of the electron transport chain. By blocking electron transfer from coenzyme Q to cytochrome c, it disrupts oxidative phosphorylation and ATP synthesis. Option C . Malonate: Malonate is a competitive inhibitor of succinate dehydrogenase, which is a key enzyme in the citric acid cycle (also known as the Krebs cycle). By inhibiting succinate dehydrogenase, malonate indirectly affects oxidative phosphorylation by reducing the availability of electron carriers in the electron transport chain. Reference: .",

      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "observed in Mc Ardle's disease , also known as glycogen storage disease type V. Mc Ardle's disease is caused by a deficiency of the enzyme myophosphorylase, which is responsible for breaking down glycogen into glucose-1-phosphate in muscle tissue. Without this enzyme, glycogen cannot be efficiently broken down, leading to impaired energy production during exercise . As a result, the muscle relies on anaerobic glycolysis, leading to the accumulation of lactic acid and subsequent alkaline pH. Incorrect options: Option B . Von Gierke's disease: Von Gierke's disease, also known as glycogen storage disease type I, is caused by a deficiency of the enzyme glucose-6-phosphatase. This enzyme is involved in the final step of gluconeogenesis and glycogenolysis, converting glucose-6-phosphate to glucose. However, Von Gierke's disease does not result in an alkaline pH of skeletal muscle after strenuous exercise. Option C . Her's disease: Her's disease, or glycogen storage disease type VI, is caused by a deficiency of the enzyme liver glycogen phosphorylase. This enzyme is responsible for breaking down glycogen into glucose in the liver. However, Her's disease does not lead to an alkaline pH in skeletal muscle after strenuous exercise. Option D . Pompe's disease: Pompe's disease, or glycogen storage disease type II, is caused by a deficiency of the enzyme acid alpha-glucosidase (GAA), which is responsible for breaking down glycogen into glucose in lysosomes. Pompe's disease primarily affects cardiac and skeletal muscles. While Pompe's disease can result in exercise intolerance and muscle weakness, it does not cause an alkaline pH in skeletal muscle after strenuous exercise. Reference: .",

A decrease in the insulin-to-glucagon ratio shifts the body from an anabolic state (storing energy) to a catabolic state (releasing energy). This leads to activation of enzymes involved in pathways like gluconeogenesis and glycogenolysis, while suppressing enzymes in glycolysis and glycogen synthesis. Glucose 6-phosphatase: Catalyzes the hydrolysis of glucose-6-phosphate to free glucose, the final step in gluconeogenesis and glycogenolysis. Regulation : Activated when the insulin-to-glucagon ratio decreases to release glucose into the bloodstream for energy. It is crucial for maintaining blood glucose levels during fasting or catabolic states. Incorrect Options: Glucokinase (Option A): The gluckinase activity decreases with a decrease in the insulin: glucagon ratio. Hexokinase (Option B): The hexokinase activity decreases with a decrease in the insulin: glucagon ratio. Phosphofructokinase (Option C ): A decrease in the insulin: glucagon ratio decreases its activity.

Option B- Chondroitin sulfate is a good glycosaminoglycan (GAG) that is commonly found as a component of proteoglycans. Chondroitin sulfate chains can attach to a core protein to form a proteoglycan structure. Option C - Made of amino acids and sugars: This is a true statement about proteoglycans. Proteoglycans consist of a core protein that is composed of amino acids and long chains of sugars called glycosaminoglycans (GAGs). The GAGs are made up of repeating disaccharide units, which include a sugar and an amino sugar. Reference: .",

        "B": "The points A and B represent the range of maximum ionization of the amine and carboxyl group",

        "D": "The compound has one ionizable group"
      },
      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "and B B Option A - The statement \"The maximum buffering capacity of the compound is represented by points A and B\" is true. Points A and B on the titration curve correspond to the region where the compound acts as a buffer. In this region, the compound can effectively resist changes in pH by accepting or donating protons. Incorrect Option: Option B - The statement \"The points A and B represent the range of maximum ionization of the amine and carboxyl group\" is incorrect. Points A and B do not represent the maximum ionization of the amine and carboxyl groups specifically. They represent the region of maximum buffering capacity, but the overall ionization of the amine and carboxyl groups can occur over a broader pH range. Option C - The statement \"The compound has three ionizable side chains\" is incorrect. Glycine, being a simple amino acid, does not have any ionizable side chains. It has a carboxyl group (COOH) and an amine group (NH2), both of which can undergo ionization. Option D - The statement \"The compound has one ionizable group\" is incorrect. Glycine has two ionizable groups: the carboxyl group (COOH) and the amine group (NH2). These groups can gain or lose protons (H+) depending on the pH of the solution.",

      "explanation": "carbohydrates as their source of energy. Since the respiratory quotient is the ratio of CO2 produced to O2 consumed, an exclusive carbohydrate diet would result in an RQ of 1. This means that for every molecule of oxygen consumed, an equal number of molecules of carbon dioxide is produced. Incorrect Options: Option A - 0.7: An RQ of 0.7 is typically associated with fat metabolism, as fats require more oxygen consumption relative to carbon dioxide production compared to carbohydrates. Option B - 0.8: An RQ of 0.8 is also commonly associated with fat metabolism, as fats have a slightly lower ratio of CO2 production to O2 consumption compared to carbohydrates. Option D - 1.2: An RQ of 1.2 is not physiologically possible. It would imply more CO2 production than O2 consumption, which is not consistent with normal cellular respiration.",

        "B": "Increases plasma glucose",
        "C": "Has slower absorption",
        "D": "Increase glycogen deposits"
      },
      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "glycemic index foods are characterized by carbohydrates that are digested and absorbed more slowly by the body. This slow absorption leads to a slower and more controlled release of glucose into the bloodstream, resulting in a more stable and sustained blood glucose response. Incorrect Options: Option A - Easily digestible: This option is incorrect. The digestibility of food is not directly related to its glycemic index. The glycemic index measures how quickly carbohydrates in food are broken down and absorbed, which is not solely determined by digestibility. Option B - Increases plasma glucose: This option is incorrect. Foods with a high glycemic index tend to cause a rapid increase in blood glucose levels, while low glycemic index foods result in a slower and more gradual increase in blood glucose levels. Option D - Increase glycogen deposits: This option is incorrect. Glycogen deposits refer to the storage form of glucose in the body, primarily found in the liver and muscles. The glycemic index of a food does not directly influence glycogen deposits. Instead, it reflects how quickly carbohydrates from the food are converted into glucose and affect blood glucose levels.",
