Competitive inhibitors clinical correlation Methotrexate and Dihydrofolate Reductase Methotrexate acts as a competitive inhibitor by mimicking dihydrofolate, the natural substrate of DHFR, and binding to its active site, thereby preventing dihydrofolate from binding and inhibiting the enzyme's activity. Sulfa Drugs and PABA Sulfa drugs, such as sulfanilamide, competitively inhibit the enzyme dihydropteroate synthase by mimicking para-aminobenzoic acid (PABA), a substrate involved in folic acid synthesis in bacteria. Ethanol and Alcohol Dehydrogenase Ethanol can act as a competitive inhibitor of methanol metabolism by competing for the active site of alcohol dehydrogenase. This is used in cases of methanol poisoning. Captopril and Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme (ACE) Captopril competes with the natural substrate of ACE, thereby inhibiting the production of angiotensin II, a peptide that increases blood pressure.

This binding changes the enzyme's shape and reduces its activity, regardless of whether the substrate is present. Effect on the Lineweaver-Burk Plot: The lineweaver burk plot is graphical representation of enzyme kinetics representing Vmax and Km. Effect on Vmax: The y-intercept of the Lineweaver-Burk plot, which represents 1/Vmax increases as Vmax decreases. Effect on Km: The slope of the plot, which is Km/Vmax, remains constant because Km does not change. The y-intercept increases while the Km remains constant for non competitive inhibition. Examples of non-competitive inhibitors: Cyanide acts as a non-competitive inhibitor by binding to a site on cytochrome c oxidase that is not the active site, thereby disrupting its function. Fluoride functions as a non-competitive inhibitor by chelating essential metal ions (magnesium or manganese) required for enolase activity, thus inhibiting the enzyme.

      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: B) Km decreases, Vmax decreases Explanation: Uncompetitive Inhibition occurs when an inhibitor binds only to the enzyme-substrate complex, preventing it from converting the substrate into product. This type of inhibition results in: Decrease in Km : Since the inhibitor binds to the enzyme-substrate complex, it effectively lowers the concentration of the enzyme available for reaction, making the apparent affinity of the enzyme for the substrate appear higher Decrease in Vmax : The inhibitor reduces the maximum rate of reaction because it prevents the enzyme-substrate complex from proceeding to form the product, thus lowering the overall reaction rate at saturating substrate concentrations. Therefore, in Uncompetitive Inhibition, both Km and Vmax decrease. Examples of Uncompetitive inhibition: Uncompetitive inhibitors Clinical correlation Lithium and Inositol Monophosphatase This inhibition disrupts the phosphatidylinositol signaling pathway, which is important in mood regulation, making lithium effective in treating bipolar disorder. Phenylalanine and Alkaline Phosphatase It binds to the enzyme-substrate complex, reducing the enzyme's activity. This mechanism is studied in the context of metabolic disorders involving phenylalanine.",

      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "enzymes lower it. Correct Answer: B) Activation energy converts molecules from ground state to transition state; enzymes lower it. Explanation Activation energy Definition Activation energy is the energy required to convert molecules from the ground state to the transition state (An unstable intermediate with partially formed and broken bonds. Activation energy is a barrier that must be overcome for a reaction to proceed; typically positive, indicating an energy requirement. Role of Enzymes Enzymes lower activation energy, making it easier for reactions to occur. Reaction Rate Factors Reaction rate increases as activation energy decreases; temperature increases kinetic energy, leading to more frequent and energetic collisions. Visualization Transition state visualized as neither free substrate nor product, with partial bonds forming and rupturing. Substrate Binding Enzymes optimize weak interactions with substrates, providing the driving force for catalysis. Influencing Factors Enzyme activity is affected by pH, temperature, and presence of inhibitors or activators. Example Acid hydrolysis of sucrose: Activation energy with enzyme (sucrase) is 9,000 cal/mol while without enzyme is around 26,000 cal/mol.

      "correct_answer": "D",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: D) Glucokinase in glycolysis Explanation: Glucokinase catalyzes the first step of glycolysis, converting glucose to glucose-6-phosphate. Unlike some other enzymes, glucokinase is primarily regulated by product inhibition (glucose-6-phosphate) rather than allosteric regulation. Allosteric regulation is a mechanism where an enzyme's activity is modified by the binding of an effector molecule at a site other than the active site, known as the allosteric site. Allosteric Site: A specific location on an enzyme distinct from the active site where effector molecules bind, inducing conformational changes that influence enzyme activity. Effectors: Molecules that bind to the allosteric site and modify enzyme activity. Conformational Changes : Binding of an effector to the allosteric site causes a conformational change in the enzyme, which can alter the enzyme's affinity for its substrate and modify the enzyme's catalytic efficiency. Examples of Allosteric Regulation Enzyme Allosteric Inhibitor Allosteric Activator Notes Phosphofructokinase (Option A) ATP, citrate AMP, F-2,6-P Key regulatory enzyme in glycolysis Aspartate transcarbamoylase (Option B) CTP ATP Important in pyrimidine synthesis Glycogen phosphorylase (Option C) ATP, glucose-6-P AMP Regulates glycogen breakdown Pyruvate kinase ATP, alanine F-1,6-BP Regulates glycolysis Reference: Harper’s Illustrated Biochemistry, 32nd Edition, Page 88-91.

      "explanation": "Correct Answer: B) Sigmoidal curve Explanation: A sigmoidal curve, typical of allosteric enzymes, shows cooperative binding. Initially, reaction velocity rises slowly due to low substrate affinity. As more substrates bind, conformational changes enhance enzyme affinity, causing a sharp increase in velocity before saturation. In enzyme kinetics, a hyperbolic curve in Michaelis-Menten plots represents enzymes with simple kinetics, where reaction velocity increases rapidly at low substrate concentrations and levels off as the enzyme becomes saturated.

      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "substrate affinities Correct Answer: B) Allozymes are produced by different genes and can have distinct Km values or substrate affinities Explanation: Allozymes are variants of the same gene, not produced by different genes. They do exhibit differences in Km values or substrate affinities. Isoenzymes Isoenzymes or isozymes, are distinct forms of the same enzyme that catalyze the same chemical reaction but differ in their amino acid sequences, structural properties, or regulatory mechanisms (Option A) These variations allow isoenzymes to be tissue-specific or associated with different developmental stages, reflecting their adaptation to specific physiological needs or conditions while performing the same fundamental biochemical function. Variants: True Isoenzymes: Produced by different genes, e.g., salivary vs. pancreatic amylase. Allozymes: Variants of the same gene, e.g., glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase Isoforms: Result from post-translational modifications, e.g., sialic acid content in ALP (Option C) Identification Techniques: Electrophoresis: Isoenzymes can be separated based on mobility (Option D) Heat Stability: Some isoenzymes are more heat-sensitive. Inhibitors: Sensitivity to specific inhibitors can help differentiate isoenzymes. Km Value/Substrate Specificity: Different isoenzymes may have distinct Km values or substrate affinities. Cofactor Requirements: Isoenzymes might differ in their cofactor needs. Tissue Localization: Isoenzymes are often found in specific tissues. Examples: Lactate Dehydrogenase (LDH): 5 isoforms (LDH-1 to LDH-5) Creatine Kinase (CK): 3 isoforms (CK-MM, CK-BB, CK-MB) Alkaline Phosphatase (ALP): 3 isoforms (Bone, Liver, Placental) Reference: Textbook of Biochemistry, DM Vasudevan, 7th Edition, Page 66, 67, 302-308",

It consists of four subunits, forming five different isoenzymes that vary in tissue distribution.

Isoenzyme Tissue/Organ Clinical Use LDH-1 (Option A) Heart Elevated levels can indicate myocardial infarction or other tissue damage. LDH-2 (Option B) Reticuloendothelial system Elevated levels can suggest tissue damage or disease. LDH-3 (Option C) Lungs Elevated levels can be associated with lung conditions. LDH-4 Kidneys and placenta Elevated levels may indicate kidney or placental issues. LDH-5 Liver and skeletal muscle Elevated levels can be related to liver or muscle damage.
