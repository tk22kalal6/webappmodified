      "explanation": "Correct Answer: B) Glucuronic Acid Explanation Glucuronidation is a biochemical process in which a glucuronic acid molecule is attached to a substance, making it more water-soluble and easier to excrete. This process is essential for the detoxification and elimination of substances like bilirubin, drugs, and hormones in the liver. Synthetic Reaction Description Examples Glucuronidation Conjugation with glucuronic acid via UDP-glucuronosyl transferases (UGTs). Chloramphenicol, aspirin, paracetamol, morphine, bilirubin, steroid hormones, thyroxine. Acetylation Conjugation with acetyl CoA, mediated by N-acetyl transferases. Isoniazid, sulfonamides, hydralazine, dapsone, clonazepam. Methylation Methylation of amines and phenols by methyl transferases using methionine or cysteine as donors. Adrenaline, histamine, methyldopa, captopril, mercaptopurine. Sulfation Conjugation of phenols and steroids with sulfate by sulfotransferases (SULTs). Chloramphenicol, methyldopa, adrenal steroids.

Ribonucleoside Synthesis Conjugation for activation of purine and pyrimidine antimetabolites. Cancer chemotherapeutic agents. Glycation (Option A): Glycation is the non-enzymatic attachment of sugars to proteins or lipids, typically seen in conditions like diabetes. It does not involve the conjugation of substances in the way glucuronidation does. Glycosylation (Option C): Glycosylation involves the enzymatic attachment of a sugar molecule (often glucose or mannose) to proteins or lipids, typically in the endoplasmic reticulum and Golgi apparatus. It is distinct from glucuronidation and is not primarily involved in detoxification. Oxidation (Option D): Oxidation refers to the chemical reaction where a molecule loses electrons, often resulting in the addition of oxygen or the removal of hydrogen. While oxidation can modify molecules, it does not specifically refer to the conjugation process like glucuronidation. Reference: KDT- Essentials of Medical Pharmacology, 8th Ed, Pg: 31",

Specificity Enzymes act on specific substrates and can distinguish stereoisomers. Cofactors/Coenzymes Some enzymes need non-protein molecules (cofactors or coenzymes) to be active. Substrate Binding Enzymes bind substrates at multiple points, creating chiral products from non-chiral substrates. Transition State Enzymes stabilize the transition state, lowering activation energy.

        "A": "Decreased oxidative phosphorylation",

      },
      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: A) Decreased oxidative phosphorylation Explanation: Decreased oxidative phosphorylation: The intermembrane space of the mitochondria is an important site for generating an electrochemical gradient that drives ATP synthesis through oxidative phosphorylation. Increased H+ ions in the intermembrane space can be due to decreased oxidative phosphorylation , which can be caused by a range of factors. Mitochondrial dysfunction, genetic mutations affecting mitochondrial function, or exposure to toxins or drugs that affect mitochondrial respiration. Increased ATP production (Option B): ATP production through oxidative phosphorylation depends on the electrochemical gradient generated by the transport of H+ ions from the intermembrane space to the mitochondrial matrix. Reduced chemiosmosis (Option C): Increased H+ ions in the intermembrane space can lead to increased chemiosmosis, which is the process by which the H+ gradient generated across the inner mitochondrial membrane drives ATP synthesis through oxidative phosphorylation. Water retention in the inner mitochondrial space (Option D): Increased H+ ions in the intermembrane space are unrelated to water retention in the inner mitochondrial space.However, increased H+ ions in the intermembrane space can lead to decreased water concentration due to changes in pH.

      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "such as certain pesticides and nerve agents, can irreversibly inhibit the activity of acetylcholinesterase (AChE The inhibition caused by organophosphorus compounds is considered irreversible because these compounds form strong covalent bonds with the active site of the enzyme . They covalently bind to the serine residue within the active site of AChE, forming a stable complex that cannot be easily reversed or dissociated. Reversible competitive inhibition (Option A) occurs when an inhibitor molecule competes with the substrate for binding to the active site of the enzyme. Non-competitive inhibition (Option B) occurs when an inhibitor binds to a site on the enzyme other than the active site, altering its conformation and reducing its activity. Suicidal inhibition (Option D) is another term used to describe the irreversible nature of inhibition caused by organophosphorus compounds. It refers to the fact that the inhibitor \"kills\" the enzyme by permanently modifying it, leading to its inactivation. Reference: Textbook of Biochemistry by DM Vasudevan, 7th edition, pg 59-62",

      "explanation": "Correct Answer: B) 880KCal Explanation: To calculate the number of calories delivered in the TPN (Total Parenteral Nutrition) bag, we need to know the caloric value of each macronutrient. The caloric values per gram for each macronutrient are as follows: Glucose: 4 calories per gram Amino acids: 4 calories per gram Lipids (fats): 9 calories per gram Now let's calculate the calories for each component of the TPN bag: Glucose: 100g of glucose * 4 calories/gram = 400 calories. Amino acids: 30g of amino acids * 4 calories/gram = 120 calories. Lipids: 40g of lipids * 9 calories/gram = 360 calories. Now, let's add up the calories from each component: 400 calories (glucose) + 120 calories (amino acids) + 360 calories (lipids) = 880 calories Reference: Calories",

      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: b) A Explanation: In enzyme-catalyzed reactions, the Gibbs free energy curve typically shows a lower activation energy compared to the uncatalyzed reaction (represented by a higher activation energy barrier). This is one of the key effects of enzymes, as they lower the activation energy, allowing the reaction to proceed more rapidly. Gibbs free energy change, symbolized as AG, is a thermodynamic quantity that measures the energy available in a chemical reaction to do useful work at constant temperature and pressure. The Gibbs free energy change is defined by the equation: AG = AH - TAS Where: AG is the Gibbs free energy change AH is the change in enthalpy (heat content) of the system T is the temperature in Kelvin AS is the change in entropy (disorder) of the system Option B : All the reactions have a transition state, but not all reactions have an intermediate state. Option C : Transition energy intermediate never has lower energy compared to the product. Option D: Free energy change cannot be a straight line. It has to pass through a a high energy intermediate state. Reference: Gibbs free energy",

      },
      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer C - Km of an enzyme = 2 micromole and Kcat = 200 per sec: Km of an enzyme = 2 micromole and Kcat = 200 per sec: Catalytic efficiency, also known as specificity constant, is a measure of how effectively an enzyme converts substrate to product. It is calculated as the ratio of the catalytic rate constant (Kcat) to the Michaelis constant (Km). Km of an enzyme = 2 micromole and Kcat = 200 per sec : Catalytic efficiency = Kcat / Km = 200 / 2 = 100 per micromole per sec. Catalytic efficiency refers to the measure of how effectively an enzyme catalyzes a specific reaction. It is a measure of the enzyme's ability to convert substrate molecules into products within a given time frame. Catalytic efficiency is commonly expressed using the Michaelis-Menten equation, which relates the rate of the enzymatic reaction to the concentration of the substrate. The two important parameters used to evaluate catalytic efficiency are the turnover number (kcat) and the Michaelis constant (Km). Reference: Catalytic efficiency",
