      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "duodenum. stomach. In the duodenum , pancreatic proteases hydrolyze cobalophilin , freeing vitamin B12 to bind intrinsic factor (IF) for further absorption. This step is essential for efficient vitamin B12 absorption in the ileum . Vitamin B12 Absorption Process Step Description 1. Release in Stomach Gastric acid and pepsin release vitamin B12 from dietary proteins. 2. Binding to Cobalophilin (Haptocorrin) Salivary cobalophilin (R-protein) binds vitamin B12 for protection from acidic degradation. 3. Release in Duodenum Pancreatic enzymes hydrolyze cobalophilin, releasing vitamin B12. 4. Binding to Intrinsic Factor (IF) Intrinsic factor (IF) secreted by gastric parietal cells binds vitamin B12. 5. Ileal Absorption The IF-B12 complex binds to specific receptors in the terminal ileum for absorption. 6. Transport in Blood Vitamin B12 binds to transcobalamin II for systemic distribution. Intrinsic factor is secreted by the pancreas and binds to inactive forms of vitamin B12. (Option A) Intrinsic factor (IF) is secreted by parietal cells of the stomach , not the pancreas. It binds active vitamin B12, facilitating ileal absorption. Gastric acid and pepsin are not necessary for vitamin B12 absorption. (Option C) Gastric acid and pepsin are essential to release vitamin B12 from dietary proteins in the stomach. Without them, B12 remains bound to food and cannot be absorbed . Ileal receptors bind directly to vitamin B12 without the need for intrinsic factors. (Option D) Vitamin B12 must be bound to intrinsic factor (IF) to be absorbed. The ileal receptors recognize the IF-B12 complex , not free vitamin B12.",

        "D": "Avidin is heat-stable and retains its binding capacity after boiling eggs."
      },
      "correct_answer": "D",
      "explanation": "Correct answer: D) Avidin is heat-stable and retains its binding capacity after boiling eggs. by avidin prevents its absorption in the intestine, potentially leading to deficiency. Avidin is heat-labile; cooking denatures it, rendering it incapable of binding biotin. Since avidin loses its function when exposed to heat, it does not retain its binding capacity after boiling eggs. Avidin-Biotin System: Aspect Details Avidin Glycoprotein found in egg whites; binds biotin with high affinity. Biotin Water-soluble vitamin (B7) essential for carboxylation reactions in metabolism. Affinity (Option A ruled out) Avidin-biotin binding is among the strongest non-covalent interactions (Kd ~10 I ¹ I M). Binding Sites (Option B ruled out) Each avidin molecule has four binding sites, making it useful in high-sensitivity biochemical assays. Biotin Deficiency (Option C ruled out) Chronic raw egg consumption can lead to deficiency, causing dermatitis, alopecia, and neurological symptoms. Heat Stability Avidin is heat-labile and denatured by cooking, preventing it from binding biotin.

        "D": "Enhanced inflammation in the retina"
      },
      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "Correct answer: A) Increased prostaglandin synthesis Explanation: Niacin toxicity can cause macular edema due to increased prostaglandin synthesis , leading to vasodilation and increased vascular permeability in the retina. Prostaglandins promote fluid leakage from retinal capillaries , contributing to macular edema . Niacin-induced flushing and vasodilation are mediated by prostaglandins , which explains both the systemic and ocular effects. Discontinuation of niacin or treatment with prostaglandin inhibitors (e.g., aspirin, NSAIDs) can help resolve the condition. Niacin Toxicity and Ocular Complications Effect Mechanism Clinical Manifestations Flushing Increased prostaglandins → Vasodilation Redness, warmth, tingling Macular Edema Increased vascular permeability due to prostaglandins Blurred vision, central vision loss Hepatotoxicity Disrupted lipid metabolism Elevated liver enzymes, jaundice Hyperglycemia Insulin resistance Increased blood glucose levels Hyperuricemia Reduced renal excretion of uric acid Increased risk of gout Inhibition of retinal blood flow (Option B): Incorrect because niacin increases rather than decreases retinal blood flow due to vasodilation. Direct toxicity to retinal pigment epithelium (Option C): Incorrect because niacin does not cause direct retinal pigment epithelial damage . Enhanced inflammation in the retina (Option D): Incorrect because macular edema in niacin toxicity is not due to inflammatory cell infiltration , but rather increased prostaglandin-induced vascular leakage .

Role: Impairment affects folic acid metabolism, leading to functional folate deficiency. Deficiency Impact: Causes pernicious anaemia and spinal cord degeneration due to failed methylation of arginine in myelin basic protein. This is a result of methionine deficiency in the CNS. Folate trap: The 2 Co-enzyme forms of vitamin B-12 are: 1. Adenosylcobalamin Deficiency: Function: Coenzyme form of vitamin B12 essential for energy metabolism in mitochondria. Deficiency Impact: Impaired Energy Production: Reduces ATP production, causing chronic fatigue, muscle weakness, and weight loss. Neurological Damage: Accumulation of neurotoxic methylmalonic acid impairs fatty acid synthesis for myelin sheath maintenance, resulting in nerve degeneration and neurological disorders. Disrupts amino acid and hormone metabolism, leading to systemic metabolic disorders. 2. Methylcobalamin Deficiency: Function: The bioactive form of vitamin B12 is crucial for the methylation cycle and methionine synthesis from homocysteine. Deficiency Impact: Elevated Homocysteine Levels: Impairs conversion of homocysteine to methionine, raising homocysteine levels and cardiovascular risk. Neurological Issues: Leads to neuropathy, cognitive decline, and other neurological disorders. Anaemia: Causes megaloblastic anaemia with large, ineffective red blood cells.",

Tryptophan is a precursor for niacin synthesis , and its deficiency results in pellagra-like symptoms , including dermatitis, diarrhoea, and cognitive disturbances . Aminoaciduria (loss of amino acids in urine) occurs due to defective renal reabsorption. Hartnup’s Disease and Tryptophan Metabolism Aspect Details Cause Mutation in SLC6A19 gene , affecting neutral amino acid transporter in intestines and kidneys. Deficiency Tryptophan (precursor for niacin) leading to niacin deficiency . Clinical Features Pellagra-like symptoms (Dermatitis, Diarrhoea, Dementia) Aminoaciduria (loss of neutral amino acids in urine) Ataxia, mood changes due to CNS involvement. Diagnosis Increased neutral amino acids in urine Decreased tryptophan and niacin levels Treatment Niacin supplementation High-protein diet to compensate for amino acid losses Hartnup’s disease causes a direct deficiency in niacin, leading to pellagra symptoms (Option A): Incorrect because Hartnup’s disease primarily affects tryptophan absorption , not niacin itself. Niacin deficiency is secondary to tryptophan deficiency. Tryptophan excess → disrupts niacin metabolism → pellagra-like symptoms (Option C): Incorrect because excess tryptophan does not disrupt niacin metabolism ; instead, it increases niacin synthesis. Increases the metabolism of tryptophan to serotonin, depleting niacin stores (Option D): Incorrect because this mechanism occurs in carcinoid syndrome , where tryptophan is preferentially converted to serotonin, leading to niacin deficiency .

The patient's symptoms, combined with a diet high in maize and sorghum, both known to contribute to niacin and tryptophan deficiencies suggest pellagra as the most likely diagnosis. Sorghum has a high leucine content, which inhibits the QPRTase enzyme required for the synthesis of niacin from tryptophan. Additionally, maize is low in tryptophan. Causes of pellagra : Dietary Deficiency- Maize and Sorghum based diet Impaired Tryptophan Metabolism Factors Affecting Tryptophan to Niacin Conversion: Vitamin B6 Deficiency Medications: Isoniazid (INH), OCPs Hormonal Influences: Estrogen metabolites hinder tryptophan metabolism. Genetic Disorders: Inherited conditions like Hartnup disease can impede tryptophan absorption in the intestines and reabsorption in the kidneys Carcinoid Syndrome Other Contributing Factors: Alcoholism: Interferes with nutrient absorption, including niacin and tryptophan. Malabsorption Syndromes Vitamin B12 deficiency (Option A) causes fatigue, neurological issues, and anaemia but is not typically associated with the combination of dermatitis, diarrhoea, and cognitive disturbances seen in this case. Rickets (Option C) resulting from a deficiency in vitamin D, calcium, or phosphate, present with bone deformities and growth retardation. It is not associated with dermatitis, diarrhoea, and neurological symptoms characteristic of pellagra. Iron deficiency anaemia (Option D) can cause fatigue, pallor, and shortness of breath but does not typically present with skin rash, gastrointestinal symptoms, or cognitive issues associated with pellagra.",

      "explanation": "movements (nystagmus) are classic signs of Wernicke encephalopathy , which is caused by thiamine deficiency often seen in chronic alcoholics. Wernicke-Korsakoff Syndrome (Cerebral Beriberi) Clinical Manifestations Wernicke Encephalopathy: Symptoms: Ophthalmoplegia, nystagmus, cerebellar ataxia, global confusion. Korsakoff Psychosis: Symptoms: Anterograde and retrograde amnesia, sensory agnosia, and confabulation. (Option B ruled out) Causes of Thiamine Deficiency in Alcoholics Increased thiamine requirements due to alcohol consumption. Impaired intestinal absorption of thiamine due to alcohol. Increased thiamine utilization and inadequate dietary intake. Inhibition of intestinal thiamine absorption by alcohol. Metabolic Implications Impaired conversion of pyruvate to acetyl-CoA. Accumulation of pyruvate and lactate in the blood. Potential for life-threatening lactic acidosis. Progression and Risk Factors Progression from Wernicke encephalopathy to Korsakoff psychosis if untreated. Associated with severely compromised nutritional status, often due to chronic alcoholism. MRI findings Symmetrical T2/FLAIR hyperintensities in the mammillary bodies, dorsomedial thalami, periaqueductal gray matter, and around the third ventricle. Lactic acidosis (Option C): While thiamine deficiency can lead to an accumulation of pyruvate and lactate, resulting in lactic acidosis, the clinical presentation of confusion, ataxia, and nystagmus is more indicative of Wernicke encephalopathy. Lactic acidosis might be present but is not the primary diagnosis based on the symptoms described. Dry beriberi (Option D) primarily affects the peripheral nervous system, causing peripheral neuritis, paresthesia, foot drop, muscle weakness, and distal sensory loss.
