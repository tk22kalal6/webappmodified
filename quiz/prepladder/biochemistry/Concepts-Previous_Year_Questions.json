      "question": "What is the primary mechanism behind tissue damage in long-standing diabetes?",
      "options": {
        "A": "Insulin resistance",
        "B": "Sorbitol accumulation",
        "C": "Hyperglycemia",
        "D": "Decreased insulin secretion"
      },
      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "damage in long-standing diabetes . Chronic high blood glucose levels lead to various pathophysiological changes , including: Advanced Glycation End Products (AGEs): Hyperglycaemia causes non-enzymatic glycation of proteins and lipids, leading to oxidative stress, inflammation, and vascular damage . Polyol Pathway Activation: Excess glucose is converted into sorbitol , which accumulates in tissues (e.g., retina, nerves, kidneys), leading to osmotic stress and oxidative damage . Protein Kinase C (PKC) Activation: Promotes vascular dysfunction, inflammation, and increased permeability , contributing to complications like diabetic retinopathy and nephropathy . Hexosamine Pathway Dysregulation: Alters gene expression, promoting vascular and renal damage . Insulin resistance (Option A) is incorrect because it plays a role in type 2 diabetes , but the primary cause of tissue damage is chronic hyperglycaemia , not insulin resistance itself. Sorbitol accumulation (Option B) is incorrect because while the polyol pathway contributes to complications like diabetic neuropathy and cataracts , it is not the sole mechanism behind widespread tissue damage. Decreased insulin secretion (Option D) is incorrect because it leads to hyperglycaemia , but it is the high glucose levels that drive long-term tissue damage, not insulin deficiency directly.

      "question": "Cholera is known to cause diarrhea through its interaction with specific receptors in the human body. Which of the following is known to make it easier for cholera toxin to enter the body through the intestinal mucosa?",
      "options": {
        "A": "GLUT 1",
        "B": "GM2 ganglioside",
        "C": "Cephalin",
        "D": "GM1 ganglioside"
      },
      "correct_answer": "D",
      "explanation": "and is responsible for causing the characteristic symptoms of cholera, including severe diarrhea. Cholera toxin enters the body through the intestinal mucosa and interacts with specific receptors on the surface of intestinal cells. The receptor that facilitates the entry of cholera toxin into the body is the GM1 ganglioside receptor. GM1 ganglioside is a glycosphingolipid, a type of molecule found in the lipid bilayer of cell membranes. Cholera toxin binds to GM1 ganglioside on the surface of intestinal cells, which triggers the toxin to be internalized into the cell through endocytosis. Once inside the cell, the toxin can exert its effects, leading to the disruption of ion transport and fluid balance, ultimately causing severe diarrhea. Incorrect Options: Option A - GLUT1 (Glucose Transporter 1): GLUT1 is a protein responsible for transporting glucose across cell membranes. It is not directly involved in the interaction between cholera toxin and intestinal cells. Option B - GM2 ganglioside: While GM2 ganglioside is a type of glycosphingolipid, it is not the receptor specifically associated with cholera toxin binding and entry into intestinal cells. Option C - Cephalin: Cephalin is a type of phospholipid and is not known to be directly involved in the interaction between cholera toxin and intestinal cells. Reference: .",

        "A": "Cadmium",
        "B": "Copper",
        "C": "Iron",
        "D": "Zinc"

      "correct_answer": "D",
      "explanation": "biological processes, including insulin secretion and stabilization. It is involved in the synthesis, storage, and release of insulin from pancreatic beta cells. Zinc also helps in maintaining the structure and stability of insulin molecules. Therefore, of the options provided, zinc is the best-known mineral for insulin secretion stabilization. Incorrect Options: Option A - Cadmium: Cadmium is a toxic heavy metal that can have detrimental effects on health, including disrupting various physiological processes. However, it is not known for its role in insulin secretion stabilization. Option B - Copper: Copper is an essential trace mineral that plays a role in various bodily functions, including the formation of red blood cells and maintaining connective tissues. While it is involved in several enzymatic reactions, it is not primarily known for its role in insulin secretion stabilization. Option C - Iron: Iron is vital for oxygen transport in the blood and is a key component of hemoglobin. It is not primarily associated with insulin secretion stabilization.",

      "explanation": "mitochondrial electron transport chain (complex III) , impairing cellular respiration. Can potentiate drug toxicity by disrupting metabolism of medications that rely on mitochondrial function. Most consistent with the history of consumption in a fish-farming area and post-meal drug toxicity. Alkyl guanides (Option A) : Not associated with piscicidal use or described as white and odourless in this context. BAL – British Anti-Lewisite (Option B) : A chelating agent used in heavy metal poisoning; not a fish toxin and not related to the scenario. Rotenone (Option D) : A common piscicide , but not white and odourless ; has a distinct smell and a different mechanism (complex I inhibition).

      "explanation": "distinctive phospholipid abundant in the inner mitochondrial membrane. It plays a role in the structural integrity of the mitochondria and is involved in several mitochondrial functions, including electron transport chain activity. Incorrect Options: Option A - Outer mitochondrial membrane: The outer mitochondrial membrane primarily consists of phospholipids like phosphatidylcholine and phosphatidylethanolamine. Cardiolipin is not a major component of the outer mitochondrial membrane. Option C - Cytosol: Cardiolipin is not typically found in the cytosol. It is mainly confined to the mitochondrial membrane. Option D - Mitochondrial matrix: Cardiolipin is primarily located in the inner mitochondrial membrane and is not a major component of the mitochondrial matrix.",

      "explanation": "works by inhibiting mitochondrial electron transport chain complex I, disrupting cellular respiration and energy production. Ingesting rotenone can lead to symptoms such as gastrointestinal distress, vomiting, and respiratory distress due to its effect on cellular metabolism. The description of the boy's symptoms aligns more closely with the effects of rotenone toxicity. Alkyl guanides (Option A) are a class of compounds that causes Lactic Acidosis, Vitamin B12 Deficiency and Gastrointestinal Symptoms. They are more commonly used in medical and pharmaceutical research. BAL (British Anti-Lewisite or Dimercaprol) (Option B) is a chelating agent used to treat heavy metal poisoning, specifically arsenic, mercury, and lead. Antimycin A (Option C) is an antibiotic and a known inhibitor of the electron transport chain in mitochondria. It can interfere with cellular respiration and energy production.

      "explanation": "Correct Answer: B) Cyanide Explanation: Complex IV, also known as cytochrome c oxidase, is the final enzyme in the electron transport chain, where it catalyzes the transfer of electrons to oxygen, resulting in water formation. Cyanide inhibits Complex IV by binding to the iron in the heme group of cytochrome c oxidase, thereby preventing the transfer of electrons to oxygen.
