      "explanation": "requires deoxynucleoside triphosphates (dNTPs), not ribonucleoside triphosphates, which are used in RNA synthesis. DNA Polymerase requirements & function : Synthesis Direction : DNA polymerases synthesize DNA in the 5 ′ to 3 ′ direction, adding nucleotides to the 3 ′ end of a DNA strand. Primer Requirement : DNA polymerases require a short RNA primer, synthesized by primase, to initiate DNA synthesis. Primer Binding : The 3 ′ -hydroxyl group of the RNA primer initiates the nucleophilic attack on the first deoxynucleoside triphosphate (dNTP). Template Requirement : A single-stranded DNA template is necessary to guide the order of dNTP addition. (Option B ruled out) dNTPs : The four dNTPs required for DNA synthesis are dATP, dGTP, dCTP, and dTTP. Cofactor : DNA polymerases require a divalent cation cofactor, typically Mg² I . (Option D ruled out) Properties : Chain elongation, processivity, and proofreading ensure DNA replication and repair accuracy and efficiency. A primer with a free 3 ′ -OH group (Option A): DNA polymerase cannot initiate DNA synthesis de novo and requires a primer to provide a free 3 ′ -OH group to which it can add nucleotides.

Since DNA is double-stranded , the remaining percentage must be from Cytosine (C) and Guanine (G) . C + G = 100% - 48% = 52% . As C and G are equal in amount , we divide: C = G = 52% ÷ 2 = 26% . .

UV-Induced Damage: UV radiation causes the covalent joining of adjacent pyrimidines (usually thymine dimers). These bulky DNA lesions impede DNA replication and transcription.

Nucleotide Excision Repair in Humans: A related nucleotide excision repair (NER) pathway exists in humans, addressing UV-induced damage encountered during DNA synthesis. Transcription-coupled repair, a type of NER, specifically targets lesions that obstruct RNA synthesis.

      "explanation": "distinguish it from the daughter strand. parental strand as correct and target the unmethylated daughter strand for repair. Mismatch Repair: The defect occurs as a copying error, 1-5 bases unpaired Repair is done by strand cutting and exonuclease digestion Mismatched Strand Identification: MMR corrects errors that escape proofreading during DNA synthesis, significantly reducing the error rate. In prokaryotes like E. coli, Mut proteins identify and correct mismatches by distinguishing between the newly synthesized (unmethylated) and the parental (methylated) strands. GATC sequences in DNA are methylated on adenine by DNA adenine methylase (DAM), with the parental strand being methylated and the newly synthesized strand remaining unmethylated shortly after replication. The methylated parental strand is considered correct, guiding the repair of the unmethylated daughter strand. Repair Procedure: Once the mismatched strand is identified, an endonuclease nicks the strand, and an exonuclease removes the mismatched nucleotides along with additional nucleotides at the 5 ′ and 3 ′ ends. The gap is then filled using the sister strand as a template by DNA polymerase, typically DNA pol III in prokaryotes. DNA ligase seals the nick, completing the repair process. They add methyl groups to the newly synthesized DNA strand, marking it for repair. (Option A) : Methylation occurs on the parental strand, not the newly synthesized strand, to mark it as the correct template They remove mismatched bases from the DNA strand. (Option C): Methylases do not remove mismatched bases; they add methyl groups to the DNA. They act as exonucleases during the repair process. (Option D): Exonucleases remove mismatched nucleotides, but methylases do not have this function. Reference: Lippincott 7th edition, 1217,1219 Vasudevan 7th edition Pg 583",

Double-Strand DNA Break Repair Definition: Double-strand DNA breaks (DSBs) are severe forms of DNA damage that can lead to mutations if not properly repaired. They involve the breakage of both DNA strands. Mechanisms : Cells employ specific pathways to repair these breaks, ensuring genetic stability and preventing mutations. Sources of DSBs : These can be caused by ionizing radiation, chemotherapeutic agents, X-rays, and natural genetic recombination processes. Types of Repair: Nonhomologous End Joining (NHEJ) Homologous Recombination (HR) Nonhomologous End Joining (NHEJ) Definition: NHEJ is a DNA repair mechanism that fixes double-strand breaks (DSBs) by directly joining the broken ends without requiring a homologous template. Cell Cycle Phase: Active throughout the entire cell cycle, including G0/G1 phases. Process: Involves a group of proteins that recognize, process, and ligate the ends of the broken DNA. Some DNA may be lost during the process, making it error-prone and potentially mutagenic. Key Proteins: DNA-dependent protein kinase (DNA-PK) and Ku70/80 complex are crucial for recognizing and binding to DNA ends.

      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Adding Chaotropic agents like Urea and Formamide cause denaturation of DNA. Factors Influencing Denaturation of DNA Increasing Temperature : Higher temperatures cause the double-stranded DNA to separate into single strands. Decreasing Solution Salt Concentrations : Lower salt concentrations reduce the stability of the double-stranded DNA, promoting denaturation. Adding Chaotropic Agents : Agents like urea and formamide form competing hydrogen bonds with nucleotide bases, destabilizing the hydrogen bonding between complementary bases and lowering the melting temperature (T m ). Base Composition : DNA rich in G-C pairs melts at a higher temperature than DNA rich in A-T pairs due to stronger hydrogen bonding and base stacking interactions in G-C pairs. Denaturation: In Vivo Denaturation : In living cells, DNA denaturation and renaturation occur naturally during DNA replication, recombination, repair, and transcription. These processes are mediated by nucleic acid binding proteins, enzymes, and thermal or chemical energy from ATP hydrolysis. Experimental Denaturation : In the laboratory, a combination of increasing temperature, decreasing salt concentration, and adding chaotropic agents is often used to denature DNA, ensuring the strands separate efficiently without causing significant damage to the nucleotides.
