      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: B) Glycine Explanation Glycine combines with succinyl-CoA in the first step of heme synthesis , catalyzed by the enzyme δ -aminolevulinic acid (ALA) synthase . This reaction is the rate-limiting step in heme biosynthesis. Glutamine (Option A): Glutamine is involved in nucleotide biosynthesis and ammonia transport but does not play a direct role in heme synthesis. Glutamate (Option C): Glutamate is primarily involved in the synthesis of glutathione and neurotransmitters but does not contribute to heme synthesis. Valine (Option D): Valine is a branched-chain amino acid involved in protein synthesis and energy production but not in heme biosynthesis.

      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: B) Glycine, Aspartate, Glutamine Explanation Purine ring formation requires three amino acids - Glycine, Aspartate, Glutamine and the cofactor N10-formyl tetrahydrofolate (N10- formyl THF) for purine ring formation. (Option B) (Option A, C and D ruled out) The sources of each atom in a purine were found by feeding isotopic precursors of uric acid to pigeons. The C-2 atom is from formyl THF The C-8 atom is from N5N10 methenyl THF The C-6 atom is from respiratory CO2 . N1 is from aspartate N3 and N9 are from Glutamine C4, C5 and N7 are from Glycine Reference: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7869020/ Harper’s Illustrated Biochemistry, 32nd edition, pg:338, 339 Vasudevan textbook of biochemistry, 7th edition, pg: 208",

      "question": "Which part of the haemoglobin molecule does 2,3-Bisphosphoglycerate (2,3-BPG) bind to in order to regulate oxygen release?",
      "options": {
        "A": "Alpha chains of haemoglobin",

        "C": "Beta chains of haemoglobin",
        "D": "Globin-heme interface"
      },
      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: C) Beta chains of haemoglobin Explanation: 2,3-BPG binds within the central cavity of the deoxyhaemoglobin tetramer . It interacts with positively charged residues (mainly lysine and histidine ) on the β -chains . This binding stabilises the T (tense) state , lowering haemoglobin’s affinity for oxygen and promoting oxygen delivery to tissues. Effect of 2,3 BPG on Hb: Reduces the affinity of Hb for oxygen and helps unload oxygen to tissues. A by-product of glycolysis. (Rapaport Leubering Cycle) Alpha chains of haemoglobin (Option A) : Incorrect because 2,3-BPG binds primarily to residues on the β -chains , not the α -chains. Heme iron centre (Option B) : 2,3-BPG does not bind directly to heme or iron ; it acts allosterically , not at the active oxygen-binding site. Globin-heme interface (Option D) : This is the site of coordination between globin and heme, not where 2,3-BPG binds. Reference: Harper’s Illustrated Biochemistry, 32nd Edition, Page 55",
