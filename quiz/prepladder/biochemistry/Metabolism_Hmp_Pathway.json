      "explanation": "Metabolism : Dietary Source Found in fruits, honey, and high-fructose corn syrup Structure Ketohexose Metabolism Site Primarily metabolized by the liver Fructose Metabolism : 1) Phosphorylation: Fructokinase is the primary enzyme for fructose phosphorylation. It has a high affinity (low Km) and a high Vmax for fructose. It converts fructose to fructose-1-phosphate using ATP. It is found in the liver, kidneys, and small intestine . 2) Fructose 1-Phosphate Cleavage: Aldolase B c leaves fructose 1-phosphate to dihydroxyacetone phosphate (DHAP) and glyceraldehyde. It is present in the liver, kidneys, and small intestine. DHAP enters glycolysis or gluconeogenesis. Glyceraldehyde is metabolized through various pathways. Disorders of Fructose Metabolism 1) Essential Fructosuria: Benign metabolic disorder Caused by fructokinase deficiency Excretion of fructose in urine Low risk of cataracts as aldose reductase does not act on fructose, and sorbitol dehydrogenase has low affinity for it. 2) Hereditary Fructose Intolerance (HFI): Caused by aldolase B deficiency. (Option A ruled out) Symptoms appear when infants consume sucrose or fructose. Effects are due to accumulation of fructose 1-phosphate. Symptoms: Vomiting, appetite loss, failure to thrive, hepatomegaly, jaundice, potential liver damage and death Diagnosis: Detection of fructose in urine, enzyme assay using liver cells or DNA-based testing. Treatment: Remove sucrose, sorbitol and fructose from the diet. Hexokinase (Option B) – This enzyme is involved in the initial phosphorylation of glucose, not fructose. Hexokinase can phosphorylate fructose to fructose-6-phosphate, but it does not cause the specific symptoms seen in essential fructosuria. Therefor Hexokinase is not the enzyme responsible for essential fructosuria. Glucokinase (Option D) – This enzyme is involved in glucose metabolism and is primarily found in the liver and pancreas. It is not involved in the metabolism of fructose. Therefore, Glucokinase is not relevant to essential fructosuria.",

The buildup of fructose-1-phosphate interferes with phosphate metabolism, leading to a decrease in available phosphate, resulting in hypophosphatemia. Classical Galactosemia: In Classical Galactosemia, the enzyme galactose-1-phosphate uridyltransferase (GALT) is deficient. This leads to the accumulation of galactose-1-phosphate.

      },
      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "NADPH is crucial for maintaining glutathione in its reduced form, which is necessary for the activity of glutathione peroxidase. This enzyme removes harmful hydrogen peroxide (H I O I ), protecting red blood cells from oxidative damage and preventing hemolysis. Pentose Phosphate Pathway (PPP) The Pentose Phosphate Pathway (PPP), also known as the hexose monophosphate shunt (HMP shunt), is an alternative metabolic pathway for glucose that doesn't generate ATP. Location: Cytosol It serves two primary functions: NADPH Production The PPP is a major source of NADPH, vital for biosynthesis (fatty acids and steroids). NADPH Production: RBCs rely on glycolysis for ATP due to the lack of mitochondria and depend solely on the PPP for NADPH, as they lack mitochondrial dehydrogenases. Glutathione Maintenance: NADPH keeps glutathione reduced, enabling glutathione peroxidase to neutralise hydrogen peroxide and prevent oxidative damage. Impact of NADPH Deficiency : Low NADPH impairs glutathione peroxidase, increases oxidative damage , and leads to hemolysis . Ribose-5-Phosphate (R-5-P) Synthesis Ribose-5-phosphate is essential for nucleotide synthesis needed for RNA and DNA. Homeostasis between NADPH and R-5-P production. When NADPH demand exceeds R-5-P's need, the non-oxidative phase converts R-5-P to glycolytic intermediates (fructose-6-phosphate and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate). If the demand for R-5-P is higher than for NADPH, the non-oxidative phase generates R-5-P from fructose-6-phosphate and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate, bypassing the oxidative steps. Differences from Glycolysis Uses NADP+ instead of NAD+ and generates CO2, not ATP. To produce ATP for energy metabolism (Option A): While RBCs do require ATP, their primary energy source is glycolysis. The PPP is not a major ATP-producing pathway. To generate ribose-5-phosphate for nucleotide synthesis (Option B): Ribose-5-phosphate is a product of the PPP and is essential for nucleotide synthesis. However, mature RBCs lack a nucleus and do not synthesize nucleotides. Therefore this is not the primary function in mature RBCs. To synthesize haemoglobin (Option D): Haemoglobin synthesis occurs during RBC development in the bone marrow, not through the PPP.",

      },
      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) is an enzyme involved in the pentose phosphate pathway , which is crucial for producing NADPH . NADPH is necessary to regenerate glutathione , a potent antioxidant that helps protect red blood cells (RBCs) from oxidative damage. In individuals with G6PD deficiency , there is insufficient NADPH production. This makes the RBCs more vulnerable to oxidative stress, such as that caused by fava beans , which contain compounds that can trigger oxidative damage. Without enough NADPH to counteract this stress, RBCs are damaged, leading to hemolysis (destruction of red blood cells). As a result of hemolysis, the patient may experience fatigue , jaundice (due to the release of bilirubin from the breakdown of red blood cells), and dark urine (from the presence of hemoglobin or bilirubin in the urine). Increased ribulose-5-phosphate overloads nucleotides, leading to renal failure (Option B): While ribulose-5-phosphate is a product of the PPP, its accumulation does not directly lead to renal failure. The primary issue in G6PD deficiency is the lack of NADPH and the resulting oxidative damage. Impaired glucose-6-phosphate conversion disrupts glycolysis, causing hypoglycemia (Option C): While G6PD deficiency affects glucose-6-phosphate, it does not significantly disrupt glycolysis to cause hypoglycemia. The primary issue is oxidative stress, not energy deficiency. Decreased ATP production affects muscle function, causing myopathy (Option D): While ATP is important, the PPP is not a major ATP-producing pathway in RBCs. The primary problem is the lack of NADPH and the resulting oxidative damage to the red blood cells.",

      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "cells that affects hemoglobin's affinity for oxygen. It binds to hemoglobin, decreasing its affinity for oxygen, which means oxygen is more readily released to tissues. In stored blood, 2,3-DPG levels decline over time. This results in increased hemoglobin affinity for oxygen and impaired oxygen delivery to tissues. Inosine Monophosphate (IMP): IMP is a purine nucleotide. In stored blood, IMP can be metabolized by red blood cells to regenerate 2,3-DPG. This helps to maintain adequate 2,3-DPG levels, ensuring that transfused red blood cells can effectively deliver oxygen to tissues. Inosine Monophosphate (IMP) is Hypoxanthine + Ribose Inosine in Stored Blood : Inosine stimulates 2,3-DPG synthesis, by getting converted to ribose-1-phosphate and hypoxanthine. (Option B) Ribose-1-phosphate is isomerized to ribose-5-phosphate and enters the pentose phosphate pathway, and is recycled back to fructose-6-phosphate or glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate (GA3P). GA3P is converted to 1,3-diphosphoglycerate (1,3-DPG) in the presence of GA3P dehydrogenase and NAD. 1,3-DPG is converted to either 2,3-diphosphoglycerate (2,3-DPG) or 3-phosphoglycerate 2,3 DPG enhances oxygen delivery to tissues. Blood low in 2,3-DPG shifts the oxygen-hemoglobin dissociation curve left, reducing oxygen delivery. Reconstitution of 2,3-DPG is rapid, but normalization takes days. Inosine does not retard changes in plasma Na, K, Hb, lactic acid, dextrose, or pH during storage. It increases plasma Na and K levels (Option A): IMP's primary function is related to red blood cell metabolism, specifically 2,3-DPG. It does not directly influence plasma sodium or potassium levels. Electrolyte balance is maintained by other mechanisms, and IMP is not involved in that. It prevents lactic acid buildup (Option C): Lactic acid buildup in stored blood is a consequence of anaerobic glycolysis due to glucose metabolism. While IMP plays a role in red blood cell metabolism, it does not directly prevent lactic acid accumulation. Other additives in stored blood, like citrate, help to mitigate this by preventing coagulation and slightly altering pH. It stabilizes hemoglobin concentration (Option D): Hemoglobin concentration in stored blood is primarily determined by the initial blood collection and processing. IMP's role is to improve the functional capacity of hemoglobin (oxygen delivery), not to stabilize its concentration.",

Hyperglycemia and Sorbitol Accumulation: Occurs in diabetes due to chronic high blood sugar. Excess glucose enters insulin-independent cells (retina, lens, kidneys, peripheral nerves). Aldose reductase activity increases, leading to more sorbitol production. Sorbitol dehydrogenase enzyme is absent in the eye hence sorbitol cannot be broken down further. Consequences of Sorbitol Accumulation: Osmotic Stress: Sorbitol gets trapped inside cells, causing water influx and cell swelling and cataract Formation. Tissue-Specific Enzyme Presence: Present: Liver: Sorbitol to fructose conversion, enters glycolysis. Ovaries: Sorbitol dehydrogenase present. Seminal Vesicles: Sorbitol dehydrogenase provides energy (fructose) for sperm cells.

      "question": "A newborn presents with bilateral lens opacities and decreased visual acuity. On examination, the characteristic \"oil droplet\" appearance is noted in the lens on retro illumination. Which metabolic disorder is primarily associated with developing oil-drop cataracts in newborns?",
      "options": {
        "A": "Phenylketonuria",
        "B": "Galactosemia",
        "C": "Maple Syrup Urine Disease",
        "D": "Homocystinuria"
      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "defect in the enzyme galactose-1-phosphate uridyltransferase. This leads to the accumulation of galactitol, which causes osmotic stress and the characteristic “oil drop’’ cataracts. Oil Drop Cataracts and Galactosemia: Galactosemia is an autosomal recessive genetic disorder caused by a deficiency in the enzyme galactose-1-phosphate uridyltransferase, impairing galactose metabolism. Characteristics Appearance: Distinct \"oil droplet\" look on retro illumination due to dulcitol accumulation. Symptoms: Decreased visual acuity, lenticular myopia, potential total lens opacification. Pathophysiology The inability to convert galactose to glucose leads to the buildup of galactitol. Affects lens transparency, causing cataracts shortly after birth. Management and Treatment Dietary Restrictions: Eliminate all sources of galactose (milk, dairy) to prevent progression. Surgical",
