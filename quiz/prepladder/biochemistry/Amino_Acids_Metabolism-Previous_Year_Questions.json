        "A": "Hyperammonemia",
        "B": "Decreased ATP synthesis",
        "C": "Oxidative carboxylation of alpha-ketoglutarate",
        "D": "Increased synthesis of glutamine and glutamine from alpha-ketoglutarate"
      },
      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "reaction is involved in the catabolism of amino acids. It is responsible for the generation and transport of ammonia from peripheral cells to the liver. The conversion of glutamate to alpha-ketoglutarate occurs only in the liver (oxidative decarboxylation). Hence, in the case of advanced liver disease, this will not be possible. Transamination Process Transfer of an α -amino group from an amino acid to one keto acid, producing a new α -keto acid and a new amino acid. The first step is the catabolism of most amino acids. All amino acids, except Proline, hydroxyproline, threonine, and lysine, participate in transamination . Biological Importance Amino Acid Interconversion: Maintains balance of non-essential amino acids by transferring amino groups to synthesise needed amino acids. Ammonia Disposal: Detoxifies ammonia by funnelling amino groups into glutamate, which is deaminated in the liver for excretion. Glutamate's Role α -Ketoglutarate: Acts as an acceptor of amino groups from most amino acids, converting to glutamate. Transamination occurs in the cytoplasm; the amino group is transported to the liver as glutamate. Oxidative Deamination: Glutamate undergoes rapid oxidative deamination in the mitochondria to form α -ketoglutarate, which can accept another amino group. Enzymes Aminotransferases (Transaminases): Catalyse the transfer of amino groups between carbon skeletons. They are not coenzymes. Alanine Aminotransferase (ALT): Transfers amino group from alanine to α -ketoglutarate, forming pyruvate and glutamate. Aspartate Aminotransferase (AST): Transfers amino groups from glutamate to oxaloacetate, forming aspartate used in the urea cycle. Coenzyme Pyridoxal Phosphate (PLP): Required by all aminotransferases, derived from vitamin B6. Reversibility Transamination reactions are reversible, with equilibrium constants near 1. Hyperammonemia (Option A) occur due to Depletion of alpha-ketoglutarate = TCA cycle is affected and ATP is not produced. Decreased ATP synthesis (OptionB) As alpha-ketoglutarate is depleted, the Krebs cycle is affected and the amount of ATP produced decreases. Increased synthesis of glutamine and glutamate from alpha-ketoglutarate (Option D) due to liver failure, the transamination reaction will not be able to occur Reference: Harper’s biochemistry 32nd edition, Pg 282,283,291 Vasudevan 7th edition, Pg 201",

      "question": "All of the following are lipotropic factors except?",
      "options": {
        "A": "Choline",
        "B": "Lecithine",
        "C": "Arginine",
        "D": "Methionine"
      },
      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: C) Arginine Explanation: Arginine is an amino acid involved in nitric oxide production and other functions but is not considered a lipotropic factor. Lipotropic factors Lipotropic factors are nutrients such as choline, betaine, and methionine that help improve liver function and detoxification. (Option A & D ruled out) Lecithin contains choline as its primary active ingredient and is considered a lipotropic agent. (Option B ruled out) These compounds promote the flow of fat and bile to and from the liver, aiding fat metabolism and liver health. They are used to treat liver disorders like hepatitis, cirrhosis, and chemical-induced liver disease. Lipotropic formulas may increase the liver's levels of S-adenosyl-methionine and glutathione, key compounds for liver function and detoxification. Common lipotropic agents include choline, methionine, betaine, folic acid, and vitamin B12. These formulas support detoxification, protect liver function, and enhance fat metabolism. They may also play a role in methylation and epigenetics, influencing health at a molecular level. Carnitine , another lipotropic agent, helps prevent alcohol-induced fatty liver disease by improving fatty acid metabolism. Lipotropic formulas are also used in detoxification, especially in conditions like chronic candidiasis and liver damage. Daily recommended doses for choline and methionine are 1000 mg each . Lipotropic agents are often combined with other herbs and nutrients to support liver health and detoxification.

      "question": "A patient came to the hospital with a complaint of abdominal pain. Routine investigations were unremarkable. On observation, the urine turned black on standing. Which of the following enzymes is likely to be defective in this patient?",
      "options": {
        "A": "Homogentisate oxidase",
        "B": "Xanthine oxidase",
        "C": "Phenylalanine hydroxylase",
        "D": "Dihydric orotate dehydrogenase"
      },
      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: A) Homogentisate oxidase Explanation: The clinical presentation of black urine on standing along with abdominal pain points to alkaptonuria , a rare autosomal recessive metabolic disorder caused by a deficiency in the enzyme homogentisate oxidase. Homogentisate oxidase is an enzyme involved in the breakdown of the amino acids tyrosine and phenylalanine. Its deficiency leads to the accumulation of homogentisic acid in the body. Pathophysiology: Homogentisic acid is excreted in the urine. Upon exposure to air (oxidation), it polymerizes, causing the urine to turn black on standing. Clinical Features Urine discoloration: The hallmark sign is black urine when exposed to air. Abdominal pain: Likely due to deposition of homogentisic acid or associated complications like kidney stones. Ochronosis : Long-term deposition of homogentisic acid in connective tissues, leading to bluish-black discoloration (typically seen in adulthood). Arthropathy : Degenerative joint disease due to ochronotic deposits in cartilage. Diagnosis: Urine analysis: Elevated levels of homogentisic acid. Genetic testing: Mutations in the HGD gene (homogentisate oxidase gene). Management: Limit intake of tyrosine and phenylalanine. Vitamin C may slow ochronosis progression. Nitisinone : A newer drug that inhibits the production of homogentisic acid by blocking the enzyme upstream in the metabolic pathway. Reference: https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3978898/",

      "explanation": "Correct Answer: A) L-Arginine Explanation: Nitric oxide (NO) is synthesized from the amino acid L-arginine by a group of enzymes called nitric oxide synthases (NOS). The process involves the conversion of L-arginine to NO and L-citrulline. L-arginine: It is the primary precursor for the synthesis of nitric oxide in the body. Nitric oxide synthases convert L-arginine to nitric oxide and L-citrulline in a reaction that requires oxygen and cofactors. The synthesis of nitric oxide (NO) from L-arginine involves a reaction catalyzed by the enzyme nitric oxide synthase (NOS). The general equation for NO synthesis is as follows: L-arginine + NADPH + O 2 + H* → Nitric oxide + L-citrulline + NADP+ + H 2 O There are three isoforms of NOS: Endothelial NOS (eNOS) Neuronal NOS (NOS) Inducible NOS (iNOS).

      "explanation": "Correct Answer A - Protein Thermic effect of food (TEF) refers to the increase in energy expenditure due to digestion, absorption, and metabolism of nutrients. Protein: Has the highest thermic effect (~20–30% of its energy content), as it requires significant energy for metabolism and nitrogen disposal. Fat: Has the lowest thermic effect (~0–3%), as it is metabolized more efficiently with minimal energy expenditure. Carbohydrates: Moderate thermic effect (~5–10%) , primarily for digestion and conversion into glycogen or fat. Mixed meal: The thermic effect of a mixed meal depends on its macronutrient composition but will generally be lower than a protein-rich meal if all components are equal. Reference: TEF",

      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: B) Glutamine Explanation: Ammonia in Brian is detoxified to form Glutamine. Glutamine synthetase in astrocytes converts glutamate and ammonia to glutamine, effectively detoxifying ammonia in the brain. Ammonia Management in Neurons: Ammonia can be neurotoxic if accumulated. Glutamine Synthesis: Produced in neurons as a byproduct of amino acid metabolism and neurotransmitter turnover. Ammonia reacts with α -ketoglutarate and NADH to form glutamate, catalyzed by glutamate dehydrogenase. α -ketoglutarate + NH 3 I I + NADH → Glutamate + NAD + + H2 I O Glutamate is converted to glutamine by glutamine synthetase, adding another ammonia molecule. Glutamine synthetase is predominantly found in astrocytes. Glutamate + NH 3 I + ATP → Glutamine + ADP + Pi This conversion reduces ammonia toxicity by storing it in a non-toxic form. The fate of glutamine: Release into the Bloodstream: Glutamine is released into the extracellular space and enters the bloodstream. This transport helps maintain nitrogen balance and prevents ammonia accumulation. Transport to the Liver: Glutamine carries ammonia from the brain to the liver, where it is deaminated to release ammonia. Ammonia enters the urea cycle in the liver for detoxification. Importance of Glutamine in Neuronal Health: Acts as a non-toxic ammonia carrier, preventing neurotoxicity. Serves as a precursor for neurotransmitters like GABA , maintaining neurotransmitter balance.

      },
      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: C) Phenylalanine at 508 position, chloride channel Explanation: The mutation seen in cystic fibrosis (CF) is CFTR (Cystic Fibrosis Transmembrane Conductance Regulator) gene. Gene affected: CFTR gene, located on chromosome 7. Mutation type: The most common mutation is F508 (deletion of three nucleotides leading to the loss of phenylalanine at position 508). Effect : This mutation leads to defective CFTR protein, which functions as a chloride channel in epithelial cells. Pathophysiology : Defective chloride transport results in thick, sticky mucus affecting lungs, pancreas, and other organs. Inheritance : Autosomal recessive disorder. Clinical Features of Cystic Fibrosis (CF): Respiratory : Chronic cough, recurrent infections, bronchiectasis, nasal polyps. Gastrointestinal : Pancreatic insufficiency, malabsorption, meconium ileus, liver disease. Nutritional : Vitamin deficiencies (A, D, E, K), failure to thrive.

      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "high homocysteine levels is suggestive of homocystinuria caused by Cystathionine beta synthase deficiency is associated with homocystinuria. Homocystinuria: A genetic disorder characterized by elevated levels of homocysteine in the blood. The clinical manifestations of homocystinuria can include cardiovascular issues (such as early-onset atherosclerosis), skeletal abnormalities, intellectual disabilities, and other systemic complications. The patient in the question has an elevated homocysteine concentration, which is characteristic of homocystinuria. Types of Homocystinuria: Type 1 vs Type 2 Homocystinuria: Feature Type - I Homocystinuria Type - II Homocystinuria Enzyme Deficiency Cystathionine beta-synthase Methionine synthase Metabolic Pathway Affected Homocysteine to cystathionine Homocysteine to methionine Elevated Metabolites Homocysteine and methionine Homocysteine and elevated levels of methionine Biochemical Diagnosis Low levels of cysteine. High levels of methionine. High levels of cysteine. Low levels of methionine. Treatment Vitamin B6 (pyridoxine) supplementation; low-methionine diet; cysteine supplementation Vitamin B12 and folate supplementation; low-methionine diet Homogentisate oxidase (Option A) deficiency leads to alkaptonuria, a condition characterized by the accumulation of homogentisic acid, causing darkening of urine and connective tissue. Cystathionine gamma synthase (Option C) deficiency is not a well-known enzyme deficiency associated with a specific clinical disorder. Cystathionine gamma synthase is involved in the transsulfuration pathway, converting cystathionine to cysteine. HGPRTase (Hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyltransferase) (Option D) deficiency is seen in Lesch-Nyhan syndrome, which is characterized by neurological and behavioral abnormalities, along with uric acid overproduction leading to gout.",

        "A": "Phenylketonuria",
        "B": "Alkaptonuria",
        "C": "Homocystinuria",

      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: B) Alkaptonuria Explanation: Alkaptonuria is Characterized by black urine upon standing due to the oxidation and polymerization of homogentisic acid (HGA). Alkaptonuria Definition Rare autosomal recessive genetic disorder caused by a deficiency of homogentisate 1,2 dioxygenase (HGD) , an enzyme in the tyrosine metabolism pathway. Mechanism and Pathophysiology Defective tyrosine metabolism → homogentisic acid (HGA) accumulation → ochronotic pigment deposition → systemic disease (ochronosis). Deficiency: HGD fails to convert HGA to maleylacetoacetate. Consequences: HGA oxidizes into melanin-like polymers → connective tissue deposition (ochronosis). Affects joints, heart valves, kidneys, and vessels. Clinical Features Triad: Homogentisic aciduria, ochronosis, ochronotic osteoarthropathy. Pediatric signs: Dark urine (oxidized HGA). Musculoskeletal : Arthritis (spine, hips, knees), kyphoscoliosis, spinal stenosis. Cardiac : A ortic stenosis, mitral valve disease, coronary artery disease. Renal/Metabolic: Stones (renal, gallbladder, prostate). Neurological : Peripheral neuropathy, stroke. Evaluation Clinical scoring: AKU Severity Score Index (AKUSSI). Diagnostic tests: Gold standard: Urinary HGA quantification via gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. Genetic testing for HGD mutations. Imaging (CT/MRI): Joint involvement, valvular calcification. Echocardiography: Valvular abnormalities. Management Symptomatic : Pain control, physiotherapy, joint surgery. Diet : Low-protein diet (limited efficacy). Medications: Vitamin C : Reduces HGA oxidation but not urinary excretion. Nitisinone : Inhibits tyrosine metabolism, reduces HGA >95%. Side effects: tyrosinemia, leukopenia, thrombocytopenia. Prognosis and Complications Prognosis : Normal life expectancy; reduced quality of life (pain, sleep issues, disability). Complications : Stones (renal, gallbladder, salivary). Tendon/ligament ruptures. Osteopenia, fractures. Aortic calcification/stenosis. Phenylketonuria (Option A): Caused by phenylalanine hydroxylase deficiency, leading to the accumulation of phenylalanine. Symptoms include intellectual disability, seizures, and musty odor, but no black urine. Homocystinuria (Option C): Due to cystathionine beta-synthase deficiency. Presents with lens dislocation, thromboembolism, and developmental delay, but not black urine. Maple Syrup Urine Disease (Option D): Results from branched-chain alpha-keto acid dehydrogenase deficiency. Urine has a characteristic sweet odor but does not turn black on standing.

      "question": "A chronic alcoholic patient is diagnosed with gouty arthritis. What biochemical changes will be seen in this patient?",
      "options": {
        "A": "Decreased NADH/NAD+ ratio",
        "B": "Increased urea and urate levels",
        "C": "Increased urate and lactate levels",
        "D": "Increased level of alkaline phosphatase"
      },
      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: C) Increased urate and lactate levels Explanation: Increased Uric Acid (Hyperuricemia): Chronic alcohol consumption is a significant contributor to hyperuricemia, a condition characterized by elevated levels of uric acid in the blood. This occurs due to: Increased turnover of purines from alcohol metabolism. Decreased renal excretion of uric acid as lactate competes with uric acid for excretion through the kidneys. These factors increase the likelihood of uric acid crystal deposition in joints, triggering gouty arthritis. Increased Lactate Levels (Lactic Acidosis): Alcohol metabolism, particularly through the enzyme alcohol dehydrogenase, generates an increased NADH/NAD+ ratio. This shift favors the conversion of pyruvate to lactate, leading to lactic acidosis. Elevated lactate levels further impair the kidney's ability to excrete uric acid, exacerbating hyperuricemia and contributing to gout attacks. Decreased NADH/NAD+ ratio (Option A): Alcohol metabolism increases the NADH/NAD+ ratio, which indirectly contributes to lactate production and hyperuricemia. Increased urea and urate levels (Option B): While urate levels increase, chronic alcohol use does not typically elevate urea levels unless there is concurrent kidney damage or protein metabolism disturbances. Increased level of alkaline phosphatase (Option D): This is associated with conditions like bone or liver disease but is not a key feature of gouty arthritis linked to alcohol consumption.
