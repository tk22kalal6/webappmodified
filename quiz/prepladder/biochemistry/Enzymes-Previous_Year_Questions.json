      },
      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: C) Increasing substrate concentration can overcome competitive inhibition. outcompete the inhibitor for binding to the active site, allowing enzyme to function at its maximum rate. Competitive inhibition is a type of enzyme inhibition where a molecule (the inhibitor) competes with the substrate for binding to the active site of the enzyme. Mechanism : The inhibitor resembles the substrate and binds to the enzyme’s active site. This prevents the substrate from binding, reducing the rate of the enzyme-catalyzed reaction. Effect on Enzyme Kinetics: Km (Michaelis constant): Increases because a higher substrate concentration is needed to overcome the competition. Vmax (Maximum reaction velocity): Unchanged because at sufficiently high substrate concentrations, the inhibitor is outcompeted. Reversibility : Competitive inhibition is reversible by increasing the concentration of the substrate. Examples : Competitive inhibitors Clinical Correlation Methotrexate and Dihydrofolate Reductase Methotrexate acts as a competitive inhibitor by mimicking dihydrofolate, the natural substrate of DHFR, and binding to its active site, thereby preventing dihydrofolate from binding and inhibiting the enzyme's activity. Sulfa Drugs and PABA Sulfa drugs, such as sulfanilamide, competitively inhibit the enzyme dihydropteroate synthase by mimicking para-aminobenzoic acid (PABA), a substrate involved in folic acid synthesis in bacteria. Ethanol and Alcohol Dehydrogenase Ethanol can act as a competitive inhibitor of methanol metabolism by competing for the active site of alcohol dehydrogenase. This is used in cases of methanol poisoning. Captopril and Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme (ACE) Captopril competes with the natural substrate of ACE, thereby inhibiting the production of angiotensin II, a peptide that increases blood pressure.",

      "question": "In a given reaction, the concentration of the substrate is 1000 times greater than the Km value of the enzyme. After 9 minutes, only 1% of the substrate (12 microgram/ml) has been converted into product. If the enzyme concentration is reduced to 1/3 and the substrate concentration is doubled, what is the new time required to convert the substrate into the same amount of product, i.e., 12 microgram/ml?",
      "options": {
        "A": "9 minutes",
        "B": "4.5 minutes",
        "C": "27 minutes",
        "D": "13.5 minutes"
      },
      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "rate, substrate concentration, and the kinetic parameters Km (Michaelis constant) and Vmax (maximum reaction rate) of an enzyme. According to the given information, the substrate concentration is 1000 times the Km value of the enzyme. This implies that the substrate concentration is at a high level compared to the Km, indicating that the enzyme is operating under conditions of substrate excess. In this scenario, the initial rate of the reaction can be considered as approximately Vmax. After 9 minutes of reaction, 1% of the substrate is converted to product, which corresponds to 12 microgram/ml. From this information, we can calculate the initial concentration of the substrate (S0) using the equation: S0 = (100 / conversion percentage) * product concentration = (100 / 1) * 12 microgram/ml = 1200 microgram/ml the changes in enzyme and substrate concentrations in the modified scenario: The concentration of the enzyme is changed to 1/3 of its initial value. The concentration of the substrate is doubled. Given that the initial substrate concentration (S0) is 1200 microgram/ml, after doubling, it becomes 2400 microgram/ml. The new enzyme concentration (E1) is 1/3 of the initial enzyme concentration. To determine the time taken to convert the substrate into the same amount of product (12 microgram/ml), we can use the formula: t = (1 / k) * ln((S0 - S) / S0) Where: t = time taken k = reaction rate constant S0 = initial substrate concentration S = final substrate concentration Since the initial rate of the reaction is approximately Vmax, we can assume that the reaction rate constant (k) remains constant in both scenarios. Using the given data, the time taken to convert the substrate into the same amount of product can be calculated as follows: t = (1 / k) * ln((1200 - 12) / 1200) = (1 / k) * ln(1188 / 1200) 27 minutes: This is the correct answer for the modified scenario. It represents the time taken to convert the substrate into the same amount of product (12 microgram/ml) with the modified enzyme and substrate concentrations. Incorrect options: Option A: 9 minutes: This is the time taken in the initial scenario, but it's not the correct answer for the modified scenario. Option B: 4.5 minutes: This option is not correct. Option D: 13.5 minutes: This option is not correct. Reference: .",

      "correct_answer": "D",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: D) RNA-dependent RNA polymerase Explanation: RNA-dependent DNA polymerase enzyme is used by RNA viruses (like poliovirus, which can cause acute flaccid paralysis) to replicate their RNA genome. In these viruses, RNA-dependent RNA polymerase synthesizes RNA from an RNA template, which is critical for viral replication and transcription. In RT-PCR (Reverse Transcription Polymerase Chain Reaction), the key enzyme responsible for converting RNA into complementary DNA (cDNA) is RNA-dependent DNA polymerase , also known as reverse transcriptase . This enzyme synthesizes DNA from an RNA template, which is a critical step in RT-PCR to amplify RNA sequences for further analysis. Incorrect Options: DNA-dependent RNA polymerase (Option A): This enzyme synthesizes RNA from a DNA template but is not involved in RT-PCR. RNA-dependent DNA polymerase (Option B): This term typically refers to reverse transcriptase, which synthesizes DNA from an RNA template, making it a potential candidate. However, it is more commonly described as reverse transcriptase rather than RNA-dependent DNA polymerase. DNA-dependent DNA polymerase (Option C): This enzyme replicates DNA from a DNA template and does not play a role in RT-PCR.

      "explanation": "lead in cases of lead poisoning. This enzyme is responsible for the conversion of delta-aminolevulinic acid (ALA) to porphobilinogen. Inhibition of ALA dehydratase disrupts heme synthesis, leading to the accumulation of ALA and porphobilinogen, which are neurotoxic. Incorrect Options: Option A - ALA synthase: ALA synthase is an enzyme involved in the first step of heme synthesis, where delta-aminolevulinic acid (ALA) is formed. Lead poisoning primarily affects the later steps of heme synthesis and does not directly inhibit ALA synthase. Option C - Heme synthase: Heme synthase, also known as ferrochelatase, is involved in the final step of heme synthesis, where ferrous iron is inserted into protoporphyrin IX to form heme. Lead poisoning primarily affects earlier steps in heme synthesis, such as the inhibition of ALA dehydratase. Option D - Coproporphyrinogen oxidase: Coproporphyrinogen oxidase is an enzyme involved in the conversion of coproporphyrinogen III to protoporphyrinogen IX in the heme synthesis pathway. While lead poisoning can disrupt heme synthesis, the inhibition is primarily associated with ALA dehydratase rather than coproporphyrinogen oxidase.",

      "explanation": "Michaelis constant (Km). The turnover number (Kcat) is a measure of how many substrate molecules an enzyme can convert to product per unit of time when the enzyme is saturated with the substrate. The Michaelis constant (Km) represents the substrate concentration at which the reaction rate is half of its maximum. The ratio Kcat/Km provides a measure of how efficient the enzyme is at converting substrate to product, taking into account both the rate of the reaction (Kcat) and the affinity of the enzyme for the substrate (Km). A higher Kcat/Km value indicates a more efficient enzyme. Incorrect Option: Option B - Km/Kcat The ratio Km/Kcat does not provide a meaningful measure of catalytic efficiency, as it would yield a value that is the reciprocal of Kcat/Km. It does not accurately represent the efficiency of the enzyme. Option C - Km/ka The rate constant for the association of the enzyme and substrate (ka) is not directly related to catalytic efficiency. Therefore, this option does not express the catalytic efficiency of the enzyme accurately. Option D - Ka/Km Similarly to option C, the rate constant for the association of the enzyme and substrate (ka) is not directly related to catalytic efficiency.

      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "reducing the activation energy involves stabilizing the transition state rather than reducing its stability. This stabilization makes it easier for the reactants to overcome the energy barrier and proceed with the reaction. Incorrect Option: Option A - Gf is lowered: This statement is correct. Reducing the activation energy involves lowering the Gibbs free energy of the transition state. By lowering the activation energy, the reaction becomes more favorable, and the transition state is easier to reach. Option C - It depends upon complementarity of the active site of the enzyme and substrate: This statement is correct. Enzymes catalyze reactions by providing a specific active site that is complementary to the substrate. The complementarity allows for optimal binding and orientation of the substrate, which lowers the activation energy required for the reaction to occur. Option D - Conformational change may occur at the active site of the enzyme at the time of binding to the substrate: This statement is correct. Enzymes often undergo conformational changes upon binding to the substrate. These changes can help to stabilize the transition state or induce strain in the substrate, making the reaction more favorable and lowering the activation energy.",
