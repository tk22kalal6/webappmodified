      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: A) DNA Editing Explanation: CRISPR cas9 is used in editing parts of the genome by removing, adding or altering sections of the DNA sequence. It is currently the simplest, most versatile and precise method of genetic manipulation. C-clustered R-regulatory I-interspaced S-short P-palindromic R-repeats NHEJ and HEJ are the two mechanisms employed by the CRISPR-Cas9 System. It is a powerful tool for inducing precise double-stranded breaks in DNA. CRISPR-Cas9 System Components: Guide RNA (gRNA): Directs the Cas9 enzyme to a specific DNA sequence. Cas9 Enzyme: Induces double-stranded breaks (DSBs) at the target site. Repair Mechanisms: Non-homologous end Joining (NHEJ): This technique directly ligates broken DNA ends without a template, often leading to small insertions or deletions. It can also cause gene knockout by disrupting the coding sequence. Homologous End Joining (HEJ): Uses a homologous template for precise repair of Double strand breaks and enables accurate gene knock-in or correction of mutations. Post-transcriptional Modification (Option B): This process involves changes to RNA after it has been transcribed from DNA, such as splicing, capping, and polyadenylation. It does not involve CRISPR-Cas9 technology, which primarily targets DNA rather than RNA. DNA Induction (Option C): This term is not commonly used in the context of CRISPR-Cas9 technology. CRISPR-Cas9 is focused on directly editing DNA sequences rather than inducing changes. DNA Editing Solution (Option D): While CRISPR-Cas9 is a powerful tool for DNA editing, the term \"DNA Editing Solution\" is vague and not specific to the CRISPR-Cas9 system itself.

        "C": "Cytoplasm",
        "D": "Golgi complex"
      },
      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: C) Cytoplasm Explanation: Lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) is primarily located in the cytoplasm. The enzyme exists in various isoforms, with LDH-5 being the most abundant in the cytoplasm. About 99% of LDH activity is found in the cytoplasm, where it plays a critical role in the conversion of lactate to pyruvate and vice versa, part of the cell's metabolic processes. While a small fraction of LDH can be found in the nucleus (involved in DNA binding and transcription), the vast majority of LDH activity occurs in the cytoplasm. Incorrect Options: Mitochondria (Option A): LDH is not primarily located in the mitochondria. Mitochondria contain enzymes like pyruvate dehydrogenase and enzymes involved in the citric acid cycle, but LDH, which is involved in anaerobic metabolism, is predominantly found in the cytoplasm. Lysosome (Option B): LDH is not found in significant amounts in the lysosome. Lysosomes are involved in cellular digestion and degradation processes, and while some enzymes may be active there, LDH is not typically one of them. It is primarily cytoplasmic Golgi complex (Option D) is responsible for modifying, sorting, and packaging proteins for secretion or use within the cell, but it is not a location where LDH is predominantly found. LDH is mainly active in the cytoplasm and plays its role in energy metabolism rather than processing or transporting cellular components like the Golgi.

      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: C) Hartnup disorder Explanation The patient's presentation is consistent with Hartnup disease (Pellagra-like dermatosis) , a rare inborn error of metabolism. This condition is associated with impaired transport of monoamine monocarboxylic amino acids across the brush border epithelium of the intestine and renal tubules. Hartnup disorder Inheritance Autosomal recessive Pathogenesis Mutation in SLC6A19 gene; Impaired transport of neutral amino acids across intestinal and kidney brush border epithelium Clinical features Photosensitivity Pellagra-like rash (Decreased Niacin due to tryptophan deficiency) Neurologic symptoms (ataxia, emotional instability) - Decreased serotonin due to tryptophan deficiency Biochemical defect Deficiency of nicotinamide synthesis Diagnosis Aminoaciduria (neutral amino acids) in urine and plasma Demonstrate SLC6A19 defect Treatment Administration of nicotinamide/nicotinic acid Protection from sunlight Carcinoid tumor (Option A): Carcinoid tumors cause increased serotonin production, which is metabolized to 5-HIAA and excreted in urine. The normal 5-HIAA levels in this patient rule out carcinoid syndrome. Nutritional pellagra (Option B): Nutritional pellagra is caused by niacin (vitamin B3) deficiency and is characterized by the \"4 Ds\": diarrhea, dermatitis, dementia, and death. However, this patient has high aminoaciduria, which is not typical of nutritional pellagra. Essential fructosuria (Option D): It is caused by a deficiency of fructokinase, leading to the excretion of unmetabolized fructose in the urine. It does not cause pellagra-like symptoms or high aminoaciduria. Reference: Nelson Textbook of Paediatrics Edition 21st Pg. 707, 708, 3501",

        "D": "Sodium citrate"
      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: B) Sodium fluoride + Potassium dichromate Explanation Sodium fluoride is an antiglycolytic agent that inhibits the breakdown of glucose, and Potassium dichromate is a reagent that stabilizes the sample for accurate alcohol concentration measurement. This combination is specifically used for alcohol testing because it prevents the metabolism of alcohol in the sample. Blood Collection Tubes Tube Type Additives & Mechanism Key Applications Coagulation Tube Sodium citrate binds calcium (Factor IV) to prevent clotting; anticoagulation reversed by adding calcium. Used for coagulation studies. Must be filled completely. Serum Tube Glass/silica activates clotting (Factor XII) . Some include gel separators to prevent cellular contamination. Used for clinical chemistry, immunology, and serology. Heparin Tube Sodium/lithium heparin inhibits thrombin and Factor Xa to prevent clotting. Common in biochemical tests. EDTA Tube EDTA chelates calcium irreversibly, preventing clotting. Preferred for hematology. Stable for enzymatic studies. Glycolytic Inhibitor Tube Sodium fluoride inhibits glycolysis; may also include citrate, oxalate, or EDTA to prevent clotting. Used to measure glucose and lactate levels. Heparin + EDTA (Option A): Both heparin and EDTA are anticoagulants , they are not specifically used for preserving blood samples for alcohol concentration measurement. They lack the ability to inhibit glycolysis, which can alter alcohol levels in the sample. Heparin (Option C) : Heparin is an anticoagulant used to prevent blood clotting, but it is not suitable for alcohol concentration tests as it does not preserve the sample for this specific purpose. Sodium citrate (Option D) : Sodium citrate is an anticoagulant used mainly for coagulation studies, but it is not used for measuring blood alcohol concentration.",

        "D": "Lynch Syndrome"
      },
      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: A) Bloom Syndrome Explanation Bloom Syndrome Bloom syndrome is caused by a defect in the BLM gene, which encodes a RecQ helicase essential for DNA repair, particularly double-strand break repair. Clinical Features : Physical: Short stature, narrow face, small jaw, large ears, and high-pitched voice. Skin: Red rash on sun-exposed areas (face, arms, hands) with dilated blood vessels; patches of lighter/darker skin. Development: Fertility and learning difficulties; growth and developmental delays. Infections: Frequent ear and lung infections. Comorbidities: Increased risk of diabetes and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Cancer Risk: Early-onset cancers, especially squamous cell skin cancer, leukemia, lymphoma, and gastrointestinal cancers. Xeroderma pigmentosum (Option B): It is an autosomal recessive disorder characterized by sun sensitivity, with approximately 50% of patients having acute burning on minimal sun exposure. UV radiation causes the cross-linking of pyrimidine residues , preventing normal DNA replication. Nucleotide excision repair (NER) prevents this DNA damage. Inherited loss-of-function mutations in any of these genes give rise to xeroderma pigmentosum. The onset of freckling (lentigines) on sun-exposed skin before age two years in most patients. At an early age, there is a significantly increased risk of sunlight-induced cutaneous neoplasms (basal cell carcinoma, squamous cell carcinoma, melanoma) . Cockayne Syndrome (Option C): Cockayne syndrome is associated with defective transcription-coupled nucleotide excision repair, resulting in photosensitivity, growth failure, and neurodevelopmental abnormalities. Double-strand break repair is not affected. Lynch Syndrome (Option D): Lynch syndrome, also known as hereditary non-polyposis colorectal cancer (HNPCC), involves a defect in mismatch repair genes (MLH1, MSH2, MSH6, PMS2). It is not associated with childhood growth failure or learning difficulties.

      "explanation": "Correct Answer: A) Tay-Sachs disease Explanation Tay-Sachs disease is a lysosomal storage disorder characterized by progressive neurodegeneration, developmental delay, and a cherry-red spot on the retina. Tay-Sachs Disease Inheritance Autosomal recessive Cause Deficiency of hexosaminidase A enzyme Accumulation GM2 ganglioside in ganglion cells and neurons Clinical Manifestations Initial symptoms include loss of head control, inability to sit, exaggerated startle response to sound, and a disproportionately large head. Progressive features include spasticity, deafness, and blindness. Not associated with organomegaly. Fundus Finding Cherry-red spot is caused by GM2 ganglioside accumulation in the ganglion cells of the retina, creating a contrast with the normal red fovea. Fabry's disease (Option B): Fabry's disease is caused by a deficiency of alpha-galactosidase A, leading to the accumulation of globotriaosylceramide. It presents with angiokeratomas, neuropathic pain, and renal involvement but does not typically feature a cherry-red spot on the retina. Gaucher's disease (Option C): Gaucher's disease is due to glucocerebrosidase deficiency, causing glucocerebroside accumulation in macrophages. It presents with hepatosplenomegaly, bone pain, and cytopenias but is not associated with a cherry-red spot. Von Gierke's disease (Option D): Von Gierke's disease (glycogen storage disease type I) results from a deficiency of glucose-6-phosphatase. It causes severe fasting hypoglycemia, hepatomegaly, and lactic acidosis but does not involve retinal findings.

        "D": "PHPP dioxygenase"
      },
      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: C) Homogentisic acid oxidase Explanation The patient is most likely suffering from alkaptonuria, a condition caused by homogentisic acid oxidase deficiency. This leads to the accumulation of homogentisic acid, which is excreted in the urine. When exposed to air, the urine darkens, and a positive Benedict’s test (which detects reducing sugars) can produce a greenish-brown precipitate. The palmoplantar pigmentation and intervertebral disc calcification (also known as ochronosis) are characteristic of this condition. Alkaptonuria Definition Rare autosomal recessive genetic disorder caused by a deficiency of homogentisate 1,2 dioxygenase (HGD) , an enzyme in the tyrosine metabolism pathway. Mechanism and Pathophysiology Defective tyrosine metabolism → homogentisic acid (HGA) accumulation → ochronotic pigment deposition → systemic disease (ochronosis). Deficiency: HGD fails to convert HGA to maleylacetoacetate. Consequences: HGA oxidizes into melanin-like polymers → connective tissue deposition (ochronosis). Affects joints, heart valves, kidneys, and vessels. Clinical Features Triad: Homogentisic aciduria, ochronosis, ochronotic osteoarthropathy. Pediatric signs: Dark urine (oxidized HGA). Musculoskeletal : Arthritis (spine, hips, knees), kyphoscoliosis, spinal stenosis. Cardiac : A ortic stenosis, mitral valve disease, coronary artery disease. Renal/Metabolic: Stones (renal, gallbladder, prostate). Neurological : Peripheral neuropathy, stroke. Evaluation Clinical scoring: AKU Severity Score Index (AKUSSI). Diagnostic tests: Gold standard: Urinary HGA quantification via gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. Genetic testing for HGD mutations. Imaging (CT/MRI): Joint involvement, valvular calcification. Echocardiography: Valvular abnormalities. Management Symptomatic : Pain control, physiotherapy, joint surgery. Diet : Low-protein diet (limited efficacy). Medications: Vitamin C : Reduces HGA oxidation but not urinary excretion. Nitisinone : Inhibits tyrosine metabolism, reduces HGA >95%. Side effects: tyrosinemia, leukopenia, thrombocytopenia. Prognosis and Complications Prognosis : Normal life expectancy; reduced quality of life (pain, sleep issues, disability). Complications : Stones (renal, gallbladder, salivary). Tendon/ligament ruptures. Osteopenia, fractures. Aortic calcification/stenosis. Phenylalanine hydroxylase (Option A): Phenylalanine hydroxylase deficiency causes phenylketonuria (PKU), which is associated with intellectual disability, seizures, and a musty odor. The symptoms described here are not typical of PKU. Tyrosine hydroxylase (Option B): Tyrosine hydroxylase deficiency is associated with a condition called hereditary tyrosinemia type 2, which can cause eye and skin problems but does not present with the urine color change or intervertebral disc calcification seen in this case. PHPP dioxygenase (Option D): Deficiency in 4-hydroxyphenylpyruvate dioxygenase causes type III tyrosinemia, which is associated with elevated levels of tyrosine in the blood and urine, but does not typically present with palmoplantar pigmentation or calcification of intervertebral discs.",

      "question": "A couple brings their 4-year-old child to the outpatient department (OPD) due to self-mutilating behavior and poor growth. Which of the following associated enzyme deficiencies could explain these symptoms?",
      "options": {
        "A": "HGPRT deficiency",
        "B": "Homogentisic Aciduria",
        "C": "Phenylalanine Hydroxylase deficiency",
        "D": "Adenosine deaminase deficiency"
      },
      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: A) HGPRT deficiency Explanation Hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyltransferase (HGPRT) deficiency causes Lesch-Nyhan syndrome, a rare X-linked recessive disorder. It is characterized by self-mutilating behavior, hyperuricemia, gout, neurological abnormalities, and poor growth. HGPRT is critical for p urine salvage , and its deficiency leads to an overproduction of uric acid. Lesch-Nyhan Syndrome Clinical Features Metabolic: Severe gout, sodium urate crystal deposition causing j oint swelling and kidney damage . Neurological: Poor muscle control. Involuntary movements (resembling Huntington's disease). Facial grimacing, repetitive limb movements. Behavioral: Self-mutilation (lip and finger biting, starting ~2nd year). Other: Moderate developmental delays , potential megaloblastic anemia (from poor vitamin B12 utilization). Management Metabolic: Allopurinol for gout; lithotripsy for kidney stones. Neurological: Symptomatic treatment with drugs like carbidopa/levodopa, diazepam, phenobarbital, or haloperidol. Homogentisic Aciduria (Option B): Homogentisic aciduria, or alkaptonuria, results from homogentisate 1,2-dioxygenase deficiency. It leads to darkened urine, ochronosis (dark pigmentation of connective tissues), and arthritis but does not cause self-mutilation or poor growth. Phenylalanine Hydroxylase deficiency (Option C): Phenylalanine hydroxylase deficiency causes phenylketonuria (PKU), which presents with intellectual disability, seizures, and hypopigmentation. Self-mutilation and hyperuricemia are not associated with this condition. Adenosine deaminase deficiency (Option D): A rare genetic disorder caused by ADA gene mutations, leading to a lack of B and T lymphocytes and severe immune deficiency. Symptoms, often appearing before 6 months, include recurrent infections, chronic diarrhea, rashes, and delayed growth. Without treatment, life-threatening infections and certain cancers may occur.

      "question": "Zellweger syndrome is associated with which cellular organelle?",
      "options": {
        "A": "Peroxisomes",
        "B": "Nucleosomes",
        "C": "Lysosomes",
        "D": "Ribosomes"
      },
      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: A) Peroxisomes Explanation Zellweger syndrome is a peroxisomal biogenesis disorder caused by mutations in PEX genes. It results in defective peroxisome formation, leading to an inability to metabolize very long-chain fatty acids (VLCFAs) and plasmalogens. Clinical features include hypotonia, seizures, hepatomegaly, and craniofacial abnormalities. Zellweger Spectrum Disorder Rare autosomal recessive disorder with defective peroxisome biogenesis affecting VLCFA metabolism. Includes Zellweger syndrome, neonatal adrenoleukodystrophy, infantile Refsum disease, and rhizomelic chondrodysplasia punctata. Etiology Caused by mutations in PEX genes encoding peroxins, primarily PEX1/PEX6 Functional peroxisomal disturbances: Zellweger spectrum: Generalized peroxisomal dysfunction. Adrenoleukodystrophy: Mutations in ABCD1, impacting VLCFA transport. Rhizomelic chondrodysplasia punctata: Multiple enzymatic defects. Pathophysiology Peroxisomes: Membrane-bound organelles with >50 enzymes for fatty acid metabolism, abundant in liver/kidney. Mutated PEX genes disrupt peroxisome formation, leading to VLCFA accumulation, reduced steroid biosynthesis, and neuronal damage. Major abnormalities: Brain: Demyelination, neuronal injury. Liver: Fibrosis. Kidney: Cortical cysts. Clinical Features Multisystem involvement with severity depending on age of onset: Neonatal-Infantile: Hypotonia, feeding issues, seizures, facial dysmorphism, ocular and hearing abnormalities, hepatomegaly. Childhood: Developmental delay, FTT, hepatic dysfunction, adrenal insufficiency, neuroregression. Adolescent-Adult: Neuroregression, ataxia, neuropathy, adrenal insufficiency, leukodystrophy. Diagnosis Initial: Clinical features + elevated VLCFA on newborn screening. Biochemical tests: Elevated VLCFA, bile acid intermediates, and phytanic/pristanic acid; reduced plasmalogens. Genetic testing: Confirms PEX mutations. Prenatal diagnosis and genetic counseling recommended. Management No cure; supportive care focuses on improving quality of life. Therapies : Docosahexaenoic acid Lorenzo oil: Reduces VLCFA but doesn't halt disease progression. Cholic acid : Approved for hepatic dysfunction. Supportive Measures: Hearing aids for hearing loss. Ophthalmologic care for vision issues. Antiepileptics for seizures. Vitamin supplementation: Fat-soluble vitamins (A, D, E, K). Cortisone for adrenal insufficiency. Gastrostomy for feeding difficulties. Nucleosomes (Option B): Disorders involving nucleosomes are linked to chromatin remodeling or epigenetic regulation, not Zellweger syndrome. Lysosomes (Option C): Lysosomal storage diseases (e.g., Tay-Sachs disease, Gaucher disease) result from enzyme deficiencies affecting lysosomal function. Zellweger syndrome does not involve lysosomes. Ribosomes (Option D): Diseases involving ribosomes include ribosomopathies like Diamond-Blackfan anemia, which are unrelated to Zellweger syndrome.

      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: B) Type II Tyrosinemia Explanation Type II tyrosinemia is caused by a deficiency of tyrosine transaminase (also known as tyrosine aminotransferase), which leads to the accumulation of tyrosine and its metabolites. This condition primarily affects the eyes, skin, and nervous system, with symptoms including corneal ulcers and intellectual disability. Disorders of Tyrosine Metabolism Disorder Deficiency Enzyme Key Clinical Features Tyrosinemia type I (Option A ruled out) Fumarylacetoacetate hydrolase Jaundice, hepatomegaly, hypoglycemia, HCC, liver cirrhosis Often presents with Fanconi syndrome and renal failure Elevated tyrosine and succinylacetone (pathognomic) Tyrosinemia type II (Option B) Tyrosine aminotransferase Painful corneal erosions, palmoplantar hyperkeratosis Also known as oculocutaneous tyrosinemia Elevated tyrosine Tyrosinemia type III (Option D ruled out) p-Hydroxyphenylpyruvate dioxygenase Recurrent seizures, intermittent ataxia Elevated tyrosine and p-hydroxyphenylpyruvate Alkaptonuria (Black urine disease) (Option C ruled out) Homogentisate 1,2-dioxygenase Dark urine, ochronosis, arthritis Black or brown pigmentation of sclera (Osler’s sign) and ear cartilage Elevated homogentisic acid Reference: Harper’s Illustrated Biochemistry, 32nd Edition Pg. 296 Pubmed",

      },
      "correct_answer": "D",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: D) Galactose-1-Phosphate Uridyl Transferase Explanation: Galactose-1-Phosphate Uridyl Transferase deficiency causes classic galactosemia, a severe metabolic disorder characterized by hepatomegaly, cataracts, lethargy, and hypotonia due to the accumulation of toxic metabolites like galactose-1-phosphate and galactitol. Galactosemia Enzyme Deficiency Galactose-1-phosphate uridylyltransferase (GALT) - Classical type Galactokinase- benign disease with only oil drop cataract. Epimerase- SNHL + symptoms of classical type (Low galactose-based diet can be given which is contraindicated in the classical type) Pathophysiology Accumulation of galactose-1-phosphate (toxic causing jaundice, and liver damage) Inability to metabolize galactose from milk Damage to liver, kidney, and brain Clinical Features Hepatic: Jaundice, hepatomegaly GI: Vomiting, diarrhea, failure to thrive CNS: Seizures, intellectual disability Eyes: Oil drop cataracts Increased risk of E. coli sepsis Diagnosis Reducing substance in urine (positive)( Positive Benedict test but negative glucose oxidase test) Direct enzyme (GALT) assay Genetic testing (Perinatal diagnosis is possible) Management Lactose-free diet Breast Milk contraindicated Soy-based or elemental formulas Calcium supplementation Glycogen synthase (Option A): A deficiency in glycogen synthase leads to Glycogen Storage Disease Type 0 , characterized by fasting hypoglycemia but without hepatomegaly or jaundice. Glycogen Phosphorylase (Option B): Glycogen phosphorylase deficiency (as seen in McArdle disease) affects muscle glycogen breakdown, leading to exercise intolerance and muscle cramps. It does not cause hepatomegaly or jaundice. Glucose-6-Phosphatase (Option C) : Deficiency of it causes glycogen storage disease type I (Von Gierke disease), which presents with hepatomegaly, hypoglycemia, and lactic acidosis.

      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: C) Galactosemia Explanation Galactosemia is caused by a deficiency in galactose-1-phosphate uridyl transferase (GALT). It leads to an inability to metabolize galactose from breast milk or formula, resulting in vomiting, diarrhea, failure to thrive, and potential liver damage. Immediate symptoms after breastfeeding strongly suggest this condition.
