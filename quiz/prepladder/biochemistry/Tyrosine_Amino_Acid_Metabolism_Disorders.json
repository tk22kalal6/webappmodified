This condition also results in kidney damage, causing symptoms like polyuria and polydipsia, and recurrent kidney stones. The presence of characteristic crystals in the cornea on slit-lamp examination and hexagonal crystals in the urine supports the diagnosis of cystinosis. Hyperoxaluria (Option C) is incorrect because it leads to calcium oxalate stones (not cystine stones) and does not cause corneal deposits or Fanconi syndrome. Nephrocalcinosis (Option D) is incorrect because it refers to calcium deposition in the kidney and does not explain cystine crystals, Fanconi syndrome, or corneal involvement .",

This results in decreased availability of tryptophan for niacin synthesis, leading to symptoms similar to pellagra despite adequate dietary intake. The characteristic skin rash, diarrhea, and mood changes are consistent with this diagnosis. Tryptophan hydroxylase (Option A) is involved in serotonin synthesis, not amino acid transport. Overactivity of serotonin decarboxylase (Option C) would affect serotonin levels, not amino acid transport. Excessive dietary leucine (Option D) can interfere with tryptophan metabolism, but it is not the primary cause of Hartnup's disease.

      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "characterized by three main symptoms: dermatitis, diarrhea, and dementia. Kynureninase is an enzyme in the kynurenine pathway, responsible for converting tryptophan to niacin. A low activity of this enzyme is observed in B6 deficiency, which is caused by alcoholism. This can exacerbate pellagra caused by maize or corn intake. Causes of Pellagra: Diet with Niacin deficiency. Tryptophan (60 mg Tryptophan = 1 mg Niacin) deficiency in the maize-based diet. Tryptophan malabsorption - Hartnup's disease. Carcinoid Syndrome - Tryptophan is used to form Serotonin leading to niacin deficiency Vitamin B6 deficiency - inactivates Kynenurinase. Leucine pellagra - Quinolinate phosphoribosyltransferase (QPRTASE) enzyme is inhibited in a leucine-rich diet. Example: sorghum diet which is rich in leucine. Tryptophan hydroxylase (Option A) converts tryptophan to 5-hydroxytryptophan in the serotonin synthesis pathway, not involved in niacin synthesis. Serotonin decarboxylase (Option C) converts 5-hydroxytryptophan to serotonin, not in niacin synthesis. Niacinamide adenine dinucleotide synthetase (Option D) converts niacinamide to NAD (nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide), a form of niacin.

      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "retardation Hypopigmentation Mousy odour Phenylketonuria (PKU): Phenylketonuria (PKU) is an autosomal recessive inborn error of metabolism caused by a deficiency of phenylalanine hydroxylase or its cofactor tetrahydrobiopterin (BH4). This deficiency leads to an accumulation of phenylalanine and its metabolites, including phenylpyruvic acid. Mental Retardation: Cause: Mental retardation in phenylketonuria (PKU) is due to the accumulation of phenylketones, which compete with other neutral amino acids for transport across the blood-brain barrier. Management: To prevent mental retardation, a phenylalanine-restricted diet should be followed, along with tyrosine supplements. Hypopigmentation: Cause: Reduced melanin production in PKU results from a deficiency in tyrosine, a crucial component for melanin synthesis. This leads to lighter skin and hair color compared to individuals without PKU. Musty/ Mousy urine odor: Cause: Due to the accumulation of phenylpyruvic acid (a metabolite of excess phenylalanine) in the urine.

Laboratory tests reveal elevated levels of tyrosine and succinylacetone in the blood and urine, along with signs of coagulopathy and renal tubular dysfunction. What is the most likely underlying metabolic disorder?",
      "options": {
        "A": "Phenylketonuria",
        "B": "Tyrosinemia type II",
        "C": "Tyrosinemia type I",
        "D": "Alkaptonuria"
      },
      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "levels of tyrosine and succinylacetone , is characteristic of Tyrosinemia type I , which is caused by a deficiency in fumarylacetoacetate hydrolase. Disorders of Tyrosine Metabolism: Disorder Deficient Enzyme Key Clinical Features Tyrosinemia type I Fumarylacetoacetate hydrolase Jaundice, hepatomegaly, hypoglycemia, HCC, liver cirrhosis Often presents with Fanconi syndrome and renal failure Elevated tyrosine and succinylacetone (pathognomonic) Tyrosinemia type II Tyrosine aminotransferase Painful corneal erosions, palmoplantar hyperkeratosis Also known as oculocutaneous tyrosinemia Elevated tyrosine Tyrosinemia type III p-Hydroxyphenylpyruvate dioxygenase Recurrent seizures, intermittent ataxia Elevated tyrosine and 4-hydroxyphenylpyruvate Alkaptonuria (Black urine disease) Homogentisate 1,2-dioxygenase Dark urine, ochronosis, arthritis Black or brown pigmentation of sclera (Ochronosis) and ear cartilage Elevated homogentisic acid Reference: Harper’s Illustrated Biochemistry, 32nd Edition, Page 296 Pubmed",

      "question": "A 2-year-old child is brought to the clinic by his parents due to darkening of urine upon standing and brownish discolouration of the sclera and ear cartilage. The parents also report that their child has been experiencing joint pain. Upon further investigation, the physician suspects a tyrosine metabolic disorder and orders urine tests. Which of the following enzymes is most likely deficient in this patient?",
      "options": {
        "A": "Parahydroxy phenylpyruvate dioxygenase",
        "B": "Tyrosine transaminase",
        "C": "Homogentisate oxidase",
        "D": "Fumarylacetoacetate hydrolase"
      },
      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "of the sclera and ear cartilage, and joint pain, is characteristic of Alkaptonuria , which is caused by a deficiency of the enzyme homogentisate 1,2-dioxygenase . Garrod's tetrad in alkaptonuria 1. Homogentisic Aciduria Presence of homogentisic acid in the urine, which turns dark upon standing or when exposed to air. 2. Ochronosis Deposition of dark pigment in connective tissues, particularly in the ear cartilage, sclera, and other connective tissues, leading to bluish-black discolouration. 3. Arthropathy Degenerative joint disease, especially affecting the spine and large joints, leading to chronic pain and stiffness. 4. Cardiac Involvement Includes heart valve calcification and atherosclerosis due to the deposition of pigment in cardiac tissues. Reaction Enzyme Associated Disorder Tyrosine → p-Hydroxyphenylpyruvate Tyrosine transaminase Tyrosinemia type II p-Hydroxyphenylpyruvate → Homogentisate p-Hydroxyphenylpyruvate dioxygenase Tyrosinemia type III Homogentisate → Maleylacetoacetate Homogentisate 1,2-dioxygenase Alkaptonuria Maleylacetoacetate → Fumarylacetoacetate Maleylacetoacetate isomerase - Fumarylacetoacetate → Fumarate + Acetoacetate Fumarylacetoacetate hydrolase Tyrosinemia type I Loss-of-function mutation of p-Hydroxyphenylpyruvate dioxygenase (pHPPD) causes tyrosinemia type III, while a gain-of-function mutation causes H awkinsinuria",
