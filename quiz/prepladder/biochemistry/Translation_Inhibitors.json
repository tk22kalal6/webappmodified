      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "Steps of initiation: It involves tRNA, rRNA, mRNA, eukaryotic initiation factors (eIFs), GTP, ATP, and amino acids. 1. Ribosomal Dissociation: 80S ribosomes dissociate into 40S and 60S subunits. eIF3 and 1A stabilize 40s ribosomal subunit to prevent reassociation with 60s, allowing other translation initiation factors to associate with the 40S subunit. (Option A) 2. Formation of the 43S Preinitiation Complex: Binary complex is formed by binding of GTP and eIF-2. This binary complex then binds to methionyl tRNA. The GTP-eIF-2-tRNAi ternary complex binds to the 40S ribosomal subunit to form the 43S preinitiation complex. 3. Formation of the 48S Initiation Complex: The 5 ′ termini of mRNA molecules in eukaryotic cells are “capped.” The binding of mRNA to the 43S preinitiation complex is facilitated by 7meG-cap. 4G/4A attaches to the cap through 4E, which forms 4F. ATP-dependent helicase eIF4A/4B breaks hydrogen bonds to remove the hairpin loops and make mRNA single-stranded. (Option C ruled out) Methionine tRNA scans the mRNA to identify the initiation AUG codon, and attach the tRNA to AUG at the P site. (Option B ruled out) The association of mRNA with the 43S preinitiation complex forms the 48S initiation complex. (Option D ruled out) 4. Formation of the 80S Initiation Complex: The 60S ribosomal subunit binds to the 48S initiation complex by hydrolysis of the GTP bound to eIF-2 by eIF-5. This results in the release of the initiation factors bound to the 48S initiation complex. The rapid association of the 40S and 60S subunits forms the 80S ribosome. At this point, the met-tRNAi is on the P site of the ribosome, ready for the elongation cycle to commence",

Formation of 48S initiation complex: The 43S complex binds to the 5' end of the mRNA, and scans for start codon which upon recognition, the 48S initiation complex is formed.

Synthesis of tRNA: Rearrangement of glycosidic linkages giving rise to pseudouridine (Option A) is incorrect because pseudouridine formation occurs in the nucleus , as part of post-transcriptional modifications of tRNA. Deamination creating inosine (Option B) is incorrect because inosine is formed in the nucleus by the deamination of adenosine during tRNA maturation. Inosine is important for wobble base pairing in codon recognition. Fourth post-transcriptional modification of random methylation (Option C) is incorrect because methylation of tRNA (as part of modifications like methylation of ribose or bases) occurs in the nucleus , not the cytoplasm.",

      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "base pairing at the third position of the codon. tRNA / transfer RNA: Component Description Function Amino Acid Acceptor Arm Located at the 3' end, ending in CCA, which is added post-transcriptionally. The amino acid is attached to the 3 ′ -OH group of the A moiety. Charging : Amino acids are attached to the tRNA by aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases for protein synthesis. D Arm Contains dihydrouridine, a modified base. Contributes to the overall structure and recognition of tRNA by its corresponding aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase. Recognition : Ensures correct aminoacylation by interacting with aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase. T ψ C Arm Named for its ribothymidine (T), pseudouridine ( ψ ), and cytidine (C) content. Involved in binding tRNA to the ribosome. Binding : Positions tRNA correctly at the ribosome for protein synthesis. Anticodon Loop Opposite the amino acid acceptor arm, contains a sequence of three nucleotides (anticodon) complementary to the codon on mRNA. Wobble phenomenon Third nucleotide pair formation is non-specific (more than one codon coding for a single amino acid) (Or) Reduced stringency when the third nucleotide pair is formed between codon and anti-codon. (Or) When tRNA is written in 5’, 3’ direction, the first nucleotide of the anticodon of tRNA is not specific Degeneracy More than one codon coding for a single amino acid because of the wobble phenomenon. Codon Recognition : Ensures the correct amino acid is added to the polypeptide chain during translation. Variable Arm Located between the T ψ C arm and the anticodon loop. Its length varies among different tRNA species and contributes to the tertiary structure of tRNA. Structural Flexibility : Aids in interactions with the ribosome and other translation factors. Allows multiple tRNAs to bind to a single codon (Option A): The wobble hypothesis focuses on how a single tRNA can recognize and bind to several codons that code for the same amino acid, not how multiple tRNAs interact with one codon. Explains tRNA's ability to bind to any codon with perfect complementarity (Option B): The wobble hypothesis involves flexible or non-standard base pairing. It does not imply that tRNAs bind with perfect complementarity to all codons. Accounts for varying tRNA lengths matching different mRNA sequences (Option D): The hypothesis does not address differences in tRNA lengths or their relationship with mRNA sequences.",
