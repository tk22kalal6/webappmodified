      "explanation": "Correct Answer: A) Phospholipase A2 Explanation: Phospholipase A2 acts on the 2nd carbon atom causing hydrolysis of the ester bond in phospholipids leading to cell membrane disruption and inflammation. Phospholipase A2: (Option A) Acts at the 2nd carbon atom. Hydrolysis of the ester bond in phospholipids Release of arachidonic acid. Causes cell membrane disruption. Phospholipase B (Option B) has both PLA1 and PLA2 activities. Hence, it can hydrolyze both the sn-1 and sn-2 acyl bonds of phospholipids. Phospholipase C (Option C) hydrolyzes the phosphodiester bond of phospholipids, particularly phosphatidylinositol. Phospholipase D (Option D) hydrolyzes the phosphodiester bond at the phosphate group. Reference: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3873700/",

They have a polar head group (hydrophilic) and nonpolar tails (hydrophobic), enabling them to form micelles when in aqueous solutions. This property is crucial for various biological functions, including fat digestion and membrane formation. Lipids Categorized by Solubility: 1. Nonpolar Lipids: (Option D ruled out) Characteristics: Hydrophobic, insoluble in water, dominated by nonpolar hydrocarbon groups. Examples: Triacylglycerols (Triglycerides): Esters of glycerol with three fatty acid chains; primary fat storage in adipose tissue. (Option A ruled out) Cholesteryl Esters: Cholesterol esterified to a fatty acid; used for cholesterol storage and transport. (Option B ruled out) 2. Amphipathic Lipids: Characteristics: Both hydrophobic and hydrophilic; contain a polar head group and a nonpolar tail. Functions and Structures: Membranes: Bilayer structure with hydrophobic tails inward and hydrophilic heads outward Micelles: Spherical structures with hydrophobic tails in the center and hydrophilic heads on the surface; aid in fat digestion. Liposomes: Spherical vesicles with lipid bilayers enclosing an aqueous compartment Emulsions: Larger particles of nonpolar lipids dispersed in water, stabilized by amphipathic lipids; prevent coalescence.

The phosphate group attaches to the free OH group in ceramide to create its derivative. Choline, when added to this derivative, forms Sphingomyelin Sphingomyelin is a type of lipid classified as a phospholipid and is an important component of cell membranes. Abundant in the myelin sheath that surrounds nerve fibers. Found in the outer leaflet of the cell membrane lipid bilayer and is a key component of lipid rafts.

Synthesis occurs primarily in the Golgi apparatus, Sphingosine + Fatty acid + Choline (Option A): This combination forms ceramide and choline but lacks the phosphate group , which is essential for sphingomyelin. Hence, incorrect. Sphingosine + Phosphate + Choline (Option C): Missing the fatty acid component that binds to sphingosine to form ceramide. So, it is incomplete. Incorrect. Ceramide + Phosphate + Fatty acids (Option D): Includes two fatty acids , which is incorrect. Only one fatty acid is present in ceramide; the head group should be choline , not another fatty acid.

Cardiolipin is a phospholipid that becomes antigenic in Antiphospholipid Syndrome, leading to the production of anti-cardiolipin antibodies. Other phospholipids (Phosphatidylserine, Phosphatidylinositol, Phosphatidylethanolamine) are not antigenic Phospholipids Location Function Synthesis Significance Phosphatidylserine (Option A ruled out) Inner leaflet of the plasma membrane Involved in apoptosis . It flips to the outer leaflet of the plasma membrane, serving as a signal for phagocytes to engulf the dying cell. Synthesized in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) Plays a role in blood clotting by facilitating the binding of clotting factors. Supports neuronal function. Cardiolipin (Option C) inner mitochondrial membrane optimal function of numerous enzymes involved in mitochondrial energy metabolism. Stabilizes the respiratory chain complexes and supercomplexes Unique dimeric structure consisting of four fatty acid chains Synthesized in the mitochondria from phosphatidylglycerol and cytidine diphosphate-diacylglycerol (CDP-DAG) Antigenic Phosphatidylinositol (Option B ruled out) plasma membrane and intracellular membranes Involved in cell signaling pathways , particularly through the production of secondary messengers Plays a role in membrane trafficking and cytoskeletal organization. Produced in the ER and Golgi apparatus from CDP-DAG and inositol. Crucial for the function of insulin signaling and other receptor-mediated signal transduction pathways. Defects in phosphatidylinositol metabolism are linked to various diseases, including diabetes and cancer. Phosphatidylethanolamine (Option D ruled out) All cellular membranes Important for membrane fusion and the structural integrity of cellular membranes. Serves as a precursor for the synthesis of phosphatidylserine. Synthesized in the ER via the cytidine diphosphate-ethanolamine (CDP-ethanolamine) pathway or by decarboxylation of phosphatidylserine in the mitochondria. Plays a role in lipid metabolism and membrane dynamics. Deficiencies can impact cellular functions and are associated with various neurological disorders. Phosphatidylserine (Option A) is involved in cell signaling and apoptosis but is not antigenic. Phosphatidylinositol (Option B) is involved in cell signaling pathways and membrane dynamics but is not antigenic. Phosphatidylethanolamine (Option D) is a common phospholipid in cell membranes but is not antigenic. Reference: Harper 32nd edition page 240, 241 Lippincott Illustrated reviews 7th edition 592-599",

      },
      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: A) Lecithin Explanation: This structure is called phosphatidate — phosphatide when combined with choline results in the formation of Phosphatidylcholine also known as Lecithin . Formation of Phosphotidate: When the first two OH groups of a glycerol molecule are esterified with fatty acids. And the third OH group bonds with a phosphate group This combination forms phosphatidate , which is a precursor to all glycerophospholipids. Lecithin: In phosphatidylcholine, if the first two fatty acids are palmitic acid, the compound is known as Dipalmitoyl phosphatidyl choline . This substance is a key component of pulmonary surfactant. It is synthesized by type 2 pneumocytes in the lungs. In the later stages of the third trimester, it is produced by fully developed fetal lungs. Premature neonates often lack this surfactant due to the underdevelopment of their lungs. Phospholipids: Phospholipid Composition Lecithin (Option A) Free phosphate + choline Phosphatidylserine Free phosphate + Serine Phosphatidylinositol Free phosphate + Inositol (Option D ruled out) Cephalin (Option B ruled",

      "question": "A premature baby presents with infant respiratory distress syndrome. The neonatologist says the neonate is yet to produce a type of phospholipid adequately. All of the following belong to the same class except?",
      "options": {
        "A": "Cephalin",
        "B": "Cardiolipin",
        "C": "Lecithin",
        "D": "Cerebrosides"
      },
      "correct_answer": "D",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: D) Cerebrosides Explanation: The neonate in respiratory distress syndrome fails to produce Lecithin ( phosphatidylcholine ), a phospholipid crucial for surfactant production. Cephalin, Cardiolipin, and Lecithin are all phospholipids. Cerebroside is a glycolipid and not a phospholipid. Classification of Phospholipids(esters containing phosphate groups with fatty acid and alcohol.) Glycerophospholipids Alcohol: Glycerol Phosphatidylcholine (Lecithin) (Option C ruled out) Most abundant in cell membranes, major source of choline. Phosphatidylethanolamine (Cephalin) (Option A ruled out) Found in membranes; differs from phosphatidylcholine by choline substitution. Phosphatidylserine Similar to phosphatidylethanolamine; found in cell membranes. Phosphatidylinositol Contains myoinositol. Cardiolipin (Option B ruled out) Found in mitochondria; synthesized from phosphatidylglycerol. Lysophospholipids Contains one acyl radical; e.g., lysophosphatidylcholine (lysolecithin). Plasmalogens 10–30% of phospholipids in brain/heart; ether link instead of ester. Sphingophospholipids Alcohol: Sphingosine Sphingomyelins Found in myelin sheaths and cell membrane lipid rafts.
