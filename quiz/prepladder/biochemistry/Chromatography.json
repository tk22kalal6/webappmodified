      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "as the selenocysteine insertion sequence (SECIS). α -amino acid known as the \"21st amino acid.\" Presence : Found in proteins across all domains of life, including approximately 25 selenoproteins in humans (e.g., certain peroxidases, reductases, and selenoprotein P). Synthesis: Selenocysteine is synthesized from serine through a series of enzymatic modifications that incorporate selenium and convert it into selenocysteinyl-tRNA , facilitating its incorporation into proteins. tRNA : Selenocysteine is incorporated into proteins via a specialized tRNA known as tRNASec. Codon : It is uniquely coded by the UGA codon, which typically signals a stop in translation. (Option A) SECIS Element : Its incorporation requires a specific mRNA structure called the Selenocysteine Insertion Sequence (SECIS) , allowing the ribosome to recognize UGA as coding for selenocysteine rather than as a stop signal. Function : Essential for various biological processes, including the conversion of thyroxine (T4) to triiodothyronine (T3) by iodothyronine deiodinases. Pyrrolysine: Classification : Pyrrolysine is often referred to as the 22nd genetically encoded amino acid . Presence : It is primarily found in certain archaea and bacteria, specifically in some methanogenic organisms. Synthesis : Pyrrolysine is synthesized from lysine through a series of enzymatic modifications that form a pyrroline-carboxylate ring .\" tRNA : Pyrrolysine is incorporated into proteins using a specific tRNA known as tRNAPyl. Codon : It is uniquely encoded by the UAG codon, which usually signals a stop in protein synthesis. In the context of pyrrolysine, UAG serves as a sense codon when recognized by tRNAPyl. (Option A) Role : Pyrrolysine plays a crucial role in specific enzymes involved in methane production, aiding in the metabolism of methylamines.",

      "explanation": "Fumarate → Enters the TCA cycle , contributing to gluconeogenesis (glucose production). Acetoacetate → A precursor for ketone bodies . This dual fate allows phenylalanine to contribute to both energy sources. Metabolism of Amino Acids: Glucogenic vs. Ketogenic Classification of Amino Acids Amino acids are classified based on their metabolic fate: Type Definition Examples: Purely Glucogenic Amino acids that are converted into pyruvate or TCA cycle intermediates (e.g., oxaloacetate, α -ketoglutarate) and contribute to glucose synthesis via gluconeogenesis . Aspartate, Alanine, Glycine, Serine, Cysteine Purely Ketogenic Amino acids that yield only acetyl-CoA or acetoacetate , leading to the formation of ketone bodies . Leucine, Lysine Both Glucogenic & Ketogenic Amino acids that can be converted into both glucose and ketone bodies , contributing to energy metabolism through multiple pathways. Phenylalanine, Tyrosine, Tryptophan, Isoleucine, Threonine All amino acids can be classified as either glucogenic or ketogenic without exceptions. (Option A): Incorrect because some amino acids (e.g., ornithine and citrulline ) are involved in the urea cycle rather than energy metabolism. Aspartate is a purely ketogenic amino acid. (Option B): Incorrect because aspartate is purely glucogenic , converting into oxaloacetate , which enters the gluconeogenic pathway . Lysine is exclusively glucogenic. (Option D): Incorrect because lysine is purely ketogenic , forming acetoacetate , which is used for ketone body synthesis , and does not contribute to glucose production.

      "explanation": "between a stationary and a mobile phase. Solutes with a higher affinity for the mobile phase move faster, while those with a higher affinity for the stationary phase move slower or not at all. Multiple solutes can be separated using this method. Types of Chromatography: Types of Chromatography Description Cation exchange chromatography (Option A) Carboxymethyl sepharose is a widely used example of cation exchange chromatography, which is commonly employed for HbA1c estimation. This technique separates positively charged (cationic) molecules using an anionic stationary phase. Initially, the protein mixture is held in the stationary phase to allow impurities to be removed. Once all the impurities are removed, a technique known as elution is used upon the stationary phase to derive the desired result. In this, positively charged proteins bind to the negatively charged stationary phase. Anion exchange chromatography (Option B) It is used to separate proteins with a negative charge. The stationary phase consists of cationic groups, such as quaternary ammonium groups. This method retains anions while allowing other components to pass through. Gel filtration chromatography (Option C) Also known as size exclusion chromatography, this technique separates proteins based on their size. Smaller proteins get trapped in the pores of the gel matrix, slowing their movement, while larger proteins move quickly through the column. Paper chromatography (Option D) It is a type of planar chromatography conducted on a flat surface. This method separates amino acids based on their polarity. Nonpolar amino acids move faster, while polar amino acids stay closer to the application point. Cation exchange chromatography",

      "explanation": "proteins based on their molecular weight. In this technique, proteins are denatured and bound by SDS (Sodium Dodecyl Sulfate), which is an anionic detergent. SDS binds to proteins and imparts a uniform negative charge proportional to the protein's mass, effectively masking the protein's original charge and shape. (Option A and D ruled out) The denatured proteins are then subjected to an electric field within a polyacrylamide gel matrix. Since SDS provides a uniform charge-to-mass ratio, proteins move through the gel based on molecular weight , with smaller proteins migrating faster than larger ones. Molecular Weight vs. Size: (Option C ruled out) Molecular weight refers to the mass of a molecule. Size refers to the physical dimensions of a molecule. While larger molecules generally have higher molecular weights, factors like protein shape and conformation can influence their size. SDS coating of the protein removes the influence that shape has on the migration of the protein. SDS-PAGE Separation: SDS-PAGE eliminates the influence of protein shape and charge, ensuring that separation is primarily determined by molecular weight.

Alpha-2 macroglobulin remains elevated because it is too large to be filtered out, leading to an enhanced alpha-2 band . Other small proteins are lost, leading to a relative increase in alpha-2 globulins (alpha-2 macroglobulin, haptoglobin, and ceruloplasmin) . Disorder EPP Pattern Multiple Myeloma (Option B) It is characterised by a narrow and intense band in the gamma region, the M band. This band indicates the presence of a monoclonal protein (M protein), which is a hallmark of multiple myeloma. Nephrotic syndrome (Option A) It shows a relative prominence of the alpha-2 band. This pattern results from the selective loss of smaller proteins, such as albumin, in the urine while larger proteins, such as alpha-2 macroglobulin, remain in the blood. Decompensated chronic liver disease (DCLD) (Option C) It exhibits beta-gamma bridging. This occurs due to polyclonal immunoglobulin production, leading to a continuous smear between the beta and gamma regions. Nephritic Syndrome (Option D) involves glomerular inflammation leading to hematuria, proteinuria, and decreased kidney function. It may show increased alpha-1 and alpha-2 globulins due to acute phase reactants but not a prominent alpha-2 band.",

When a blood sample is collected in a tube with an anticoagulant, it separates into plasma at the top and blood cells below. Conversely, in a tube without an anticoagulant, blood clots due to the coagulation cascade, resulting in serum separation. Plasma (Option B) Fibrinogen present in plasma can migrate to the beta-gamma region, potentially masking monoclonal bands in multiple myeloma. Whole blood (Option C) contains cellular components (like red and white blood cells) that can interfere with the separation and analysis of proteins. Free of these cells, Serum provides a clearer and more accurate representation of the proteins in the blood. Urine (Option D) The protein concentration in urine is much lower compared to blood, which can lead to less reliable results.

      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "histidine) particularly creates steric hindrance, which reduces CO's ability to bind effectively to the heme iron. Structure of Myoglobin: Heme Group contains one iron (Fe² I ) surrounded by four pyrrole rings. The Fe² I is located slightly below the plane of the heme ring. Globin chain comprises a single polypeptide chain of about 150 amino acids (AA), arranged in eight α -helices (labelled A to H). Histidine F8: Fe² I is covalently attached to the proximal histidine F8 of the globin chain. Histidine E7: Positioned on the opposite side of the heme, it helps create a hindered environment, reducing the risk of carbon monoxide (CO) binding. Heme and CO: Carbon monoxide binds to Fe² I in the heme with 2000 times higher affinity than oxygen (O I ). CO displaces O I from haemoglobin, reducing oxygen-carrying capacity and leading to anaemic hypoxia. The globin chain, with histidine E7, provides a sterically hindered environment around the heme, which reduces CO binding and helps mitigate CO poisoning. In Oxygen, the second atom is inclined, so it is easily accommodated, whereas in CO, it is straight, which is hindered by E7. Prevent CO binding by increasing the heme's affinity for oxygen (Option A): Histidine does not directly increase oxygen affinity but stabilizes O I binding via hydrogen bonding . Enhance CO binding, similar to oxygen (Option B): CO has higher intrinsic affinity for heme than O I , but histidine hinders CO binding , not enhances it. It does not influence the binding of CO to the heme (Option D): Incorrect, as distal histidine (His E7) significantly reduces CO binding affinity by enforcing an angled binding geometry.

      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "a process called ubiquitin-proteasome pathway (UPP) . This system is ATP-dependent and ensures regulated protein degradation to maintain cellular homeostasis. The 26S proteasome consists of: 20S core particle (catalytic chamber for protein degradation). 19S regulatory particle (recognizes ubiquitinated proteins and unfolds them for degradation). Ubiquitin-proteasome pathway: Major pathway for degrading misfolded, damaged, and regulatory proteins. Ubiquitination: Proteins are tagged with ubiquitin molecules by enzymes (E1, E2, E3). Proteasome Degradation: Ubiquitin-tagged proteins are transported to the proteasome, a cylindrical structure with proteolytic activity, where they are degraded into small peptides. Lysosomes (Option A): Degrade extracellular and some intracellular proteins via autophagy , but not ubiquitin-tagged proteins . Function mainly in bulk degradation rather than targeted proteolysis. Cathepsins (Option C): A group of lysosomal proteases involved in protein degradation inside lysosomes . They do not participate in ubiquitin-proteasome degradation . Endosomes (Option D): Involved in vesicular transport , sorting proteins to lysosomes , plasma membrane recycling , or exocytosis . They do not degrade ubiquitinated proteins directly.

They form large barrel-shaped complexes that can encapsulate unfolded or partially folded proteins, providing an isolated environment for proper folding. Chaperonins bind to hydrophobic regions of unfolded proteins, preventing inappropriate interactions and aggregation. Role of Chaperonins in Protein Folding Function Chaperonin Action Prevents misfolding Shields hydrophobic regions to avoid aggregation Assists refolding Helps denatured proteins regain functional shape Provides an isolated chamber Forms a cavity where proteins fold properly ATP-dependent process Uses ATP to facilitate conformational changes Proteases (Option A): These are enzymes that degrade proteins by hydrolyzing peptide bonds. They do not assist in proper folding ; instead, they help degrade misfolded proteins. Ubiquitin (Option C): A small regulatory protein that tags damaged or misfolded proteins for proteasomal degradation . It does not assist in protein folding . Prions (Option D): Misfolded proteins that induce abnormal folding in other proteins, leading to neurodegenerative diseases (e.g., Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease). Instead of aiding folding, they promote misfolding . Reference: Harper's Illustrated Biochemistry, 32nd edition, Page 42",

Concept of Isoelectric Point (pI): Characteristic Explanation No net charge At pI, the total positive and negative charges on the protein cancel each other out. Minimal mobility Since the protein has no net charge, it does not migrate in an electric field. Low buffering capacity Buffers work best when pH ≠ pI; at pI, there is minimal change in charge per unit of pH change. Low solubility Electrostatic repulsion is minimal at pI, promoting aggregation and precipitation. Low buffering capacity (Option B): Correct, because buffering capacity is strongest at pKa values and weakest at pI. No net charge (Option C): Correct, as proteins do not carry a net charge at pI. Minimal mobility (Option D): Correct, since proteins do not move in an electric field at pI.
