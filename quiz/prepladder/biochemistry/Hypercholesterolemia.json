      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "due to mutations in the ABCA1 gene on chromosome 9q31 , which impairs cholesterol transport. Defects in ABCA1 are characterized by two clinical hallmarks; enlarged lipid-laden tonsils and low serum HDL. Also known as Familial alpha-lipoprotein deficiency/Hypo alpha lipoproteinemia. This mutation causes a decreased level of Apo A1,where HDL is not properly formed. Leads to the accumulation of cholesterol in various tissues such as the tonsils, liver, spleen, and corneas. Clinical features : Include enlarged orange-colored tonsils, peripheral neuropathy, hepatosplenomegaly and early-onset cardiovascular disease. Low VLDL levels (Option A) are not characteristic of Tangier disease. VLDL primarily carries triglycerides, and its levels are not significantly affected in Tangier disease. Low LDL levels (Option C) are not specifically affected in Tangier disease. LDL primarily carries cholesterol to tissues, and its levels can vary independently of HDL levels. Low LDL receptor activity (Option D): This describes familial hypercholesterolemia, not Tangier disease. Familial hypercholesterolemia is characterized by high LDL cholesterol levels due to defective LDL receptors on cell surfaces. Reference: Lippincott Biochemistry, 7th Edition, Page 678",

      "explanation": "Abetalipoproteinemia is a rare genetic disorder characterized by the inability to synthesize apolipoprotein B ( Apo B ), which is essential for the formation of certain lipoproteins. Pathophysiology : Caused by mutations in the microsomal triglyceride transfer protein (MTP) gene. Leads to impaired assembly and secretion of lipoproteins, particularly chylomicrons and very low-density lipoprotein (VLDL). (Option A and D ruled out) Results in low serum levels of triglycerides, cholesterol, and fat-soluble vitamins (A, D, E, K). Clinical Features : Fat malabsorption leads to steatorrhea (fatty stools). (Option C ruled out) Deficiencies in fat-soluble vitamins can cause: Retinitis pigmentosa (leading to blindness). Neurological deficits (e.g., ataxia, developmental delays). Presence of acanthocytes (spiny red blood cells) on blood smear. Management : Dietary management to provide essential fatty acids and fat-soluble vitamins.

      "question": "A researcher is studying the mechanisms of lipoprotein lipase (LPL) activity in post-heparinized blood samples.

Which of the following outcomes from the mixing study would most accurately indicate an Apo C-II deficiency?",

        "A": "The addition of pooled normal plasma results in no change in LPL activity.",

        "D": "LPL activity decreases following the addition of normal plasma."

      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "are used because heparin in circulation competes with heparan sulfate on vessel walls, causing enzymes to detach from the vessel wall and attach to circulating heparin. If LPL activity is low in post-heparinized individuals, it is either an Apo C II defect or an LPL defect. Mixing study to differentiate Apo C defect from LPL defect: In the patients post heparinized plasma, add an equal amount of pooled normal plasma which acts as a source of apo C II. If LPL activity normalizes it is an apo C II defect and it will respond to FFP administration. If LPL activity does not normalize it is an LPL defect (Option A). An increase in triglyceride levels is not indicative of Apo C-II deficiency and does not relate directly to the expected outcomes of the mixing study. (Option C) Decrease in LPL activity after mixing would suggest an error in the experiment or another underlying issue, not an Apo C-II deficiency.

      },
      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "disease is a rare, autosomal recessive disorder caused by mutations in the ABCA1 (ATP-binding cassette, sub-family A, member 1) gene . Pathophysiology: The ABCA1 protein is crucial for the efflux of cholesterol and phospholipids to apolipoprotein A-I (ApoA-I), forming HDL particles. Mutations in the ABCA1 gene impair this process, leading to a shortage of HDL and cholesterol accumulation in tissues such as the tonsils, liver, spleen, and peripheral nerves. Clinical Features: Greyish-Orange Tonsils: (Hallmark feature) Tonsils, become enlarged and acquire a greyish-orange hue due to the accumulation of cholesterol esters. Hepatosplenomegaly : Due to cholesterol and phospholipid accumulation. Peripheral Neuropathy: Multiple nerves can be individually affected due to cholesterol deposition in peripheral nerves, leading to peripheral neuropathy. LDLR gene mutations(Option B) are associated with familial hypercholesterolemia, which primarily affects low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol levels, not HDL levels. APOE gene mutation (Option C) is associated with various lipid disorders and Alzheimer's disease. While APOE influences lipid metabolism, it does not specifically cause the severe HDL deficiency. PCSK9 gene mutations (Option D) are linked to familial hypercholesterolemia, affecting LDL cholesterol levels rather than HDL. These mutations result in increased LDL and cholesterol levels and are not associated with HDL deficiency.",

It catalyzes the transfer of an acyl group from lecithin (phosphatidylcholine) to cholesterol, forming cholesteryl esters. HDL Metabolism HDL Formation: Formed in the liver and intestines as nascent, discoidal particles rich in apolipoprotein A-I (apoA-I). Cholesterol Efflux: ABCA1 Transporter , transfers free cholesterol and phospholipids to nascent HDL. ABCG1 and SR-BI Transporters facilitate cholesterol efflux to HDL. Maturation of HDL: Lecithin-cholesterol acyltransferase (LCAT) converts discoidal HDL into spherical HDL by forming cholesterol esters that move to the core of HDL particles. HDL Remodeling: Phospholipid transfer protein (PLTP) and cholesteryl ester transfer protein (CETP) modify HDL size and composition by transferring lipids between lipoproteins. Selective Uptake and HDL Recycling: Scavenger Receptor Class B Type I (SR-BI) facilitates selective uptake of cholesterol esters from HDL into hepatocytes. CETP transfers cholesteryl esters from HDL to VLDL and LDL for liver uptake. Excretion: The liver converts cholesterol into bile acids or secretes it into bile for excretion via intestines. Lipoprotein lipase (LPL) (Option A) is an enzyme that hydrolyzes triglycerides in lipoproteins into free fatty acids and glycerol. Hepatic lipase (Option C) primarily hydrolyzes triglycerides and phospholipids in intermediate-density lipoproteins (IDL) and low-density lipoproteins (LDL).

      "explanation": "acid are secondary bile acids. Primary bile acids are conjugated in liver peroxisomes. They are converted into glycine or taurine conjugates. Intestinal bacteria deconjugate and de-hydroxylase the glycine-taurine conjugates to form secondary bile acids. Fate of cholesterol: Note: The anions of bile acids and their glycine or taurine conjugates are referred to as bile salts. In the alkaline environment of bile, they are expected to exist in this form.",

Squalene epoxidase (Option D) catalyzes the conversion of squalene to squalene-2,3-epoxide, a downstream step in the cholesterol synthesis pathway, but it is not a regulatory step.
