      "question": "A patient's relatives sent a message on social media to the consulting doctor. He is unaware of the other investigations. However, he mentioned that urinary Coproporphyrin is positive. What is the probable cause?",
      "options": {
        "A": "Lead poisoning",
        "B": "Asbestosis",
        "C": "Silicosis",
        "D": "Mercury poisoning"
      },
      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "coproporphyrin, which is a type of porphyrin. Lead inhibits key enzymes in the heme synthesis pathway, particularly ALA dehydratase and ferrochelatase. This inhibition causes a buildup of precursors, including coproporphyrin, in the urine. Elevated urinary coproporphyrin is a characteristic finding in cases of lead poisoning and is used as a diagnostic marker. Incorrect Options: Options B, C, and D are incorrect, as explained above.

        "B": "Carbon monoxide",
        "C": "Ferric Ion",

      },
      "correct_answer": "D",
      "explanation": "breakdown. It is an intermediate in the biosynthesis of heme, not a breakdown product. Incorrect Options: Option A – Biliverdin: Biliverdin is a direct product of heme breakdown. Heme oxygenase catalyzes the conversion of heme to biliverdin. Option B - Carbon monoxide: Carbon monoxide is also a product of the heme breakdown process. It is released when heme is converted to biliverdin by heme oxygenase. Option C - Ferric Ion: Ferric ion (Fe³ I ) is released during the breakdown of heme. Heme oxygenase cleaves the heme ring to release iron in its ferric form. Reference: .",

      "question": "Which of the following is the rate-limiting enzyme of heme synthesis pathway? B. δ Amino-Levulinic Acid dehydratase C. δ Amino-Levulinic Acid synthase",
      "options": {
        "A": "HMB synthase",
        "D": "Ferrochelatase"
      },
      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "δ Amino-Levulinic Acid synthase δ Amino-Levulinic Acid synthase (ALA Synthase) : This enzyme catalyzes the formation of ALA from glycine and succinyl-CoA. It is the rate-limiting enzyme of the heme synthesis pathway. Its activity is tightly regulated by feedback inhibition by heme itself. Incorrect Options: Option A - HMB synthase (5-Aminolevulinic Acid Synthase): This enzyme catalyzes the formation of δ -Aminolevulinic acid (ALA) from succinyl-CoA and glycine. It is not the rate-limiting enzyme but is the first committed step in heme synthesis. Option B - δ Amino-Levulinic Acid dehydratase (Porphobilinogen synthase): This enzyme catalyzes the condensation of two molecules of ALA to form porphobilinogen. It is not the rate-limiting enzyme either. Option D – Ferrochelatase: This enzyme catalyzes the final step of heme synthesis, inserting an iron ion into the protoporphyrin ring to form heme. It is not the rate-limiting enzyme but is responsible for the incorporation of iron into the heme molecule. Reference: .",

        "C": "Fibrinogen",

      },
      "correct_answer": "D",
      "explanation": "molecules serve as binding proteins for the transport of steroid hormones and fatty acids. Lipids are hydrophobic in nature, so albumin helps their transport in the polar environment of plasma. Incorrect Choices: a. Bence-Jones proteins appear in the urine in many people that have multiple myeloma. Hence, it is not considered as the most abundant protein. b. Globulins are protein groups that are present in our blood and made in our liver by our immune system. It plays an important role in immune function, blood clotting, liver function etc. Various types of globulins are present in our body such as alpha, gamma globulins etc. It is considered as some of the abundant storage protein. c. Fibrinogen is considered the least abundant plasma protein in the blood. Reference: .",

      "question": "What is the most appropriate dietary recommendation for a middle-aged man diagnosed with a rare variant of pyruvate dehydrogenase deficiency, resulting in high anion gap metabolic acidosis?",
      "options": {
        "A": "High protein and low carbohydrate intake",
        "B": "High carbohydrate and low fat intake",
        "C": "High fat and low carbohydrate intake",
        "D": "Only carbohydrate intake henceforth"
      },
      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "help reduce the production of pyruvate, as fats can be converted into ketone bodies, which are an alternative fuel source for the body. A high-fat, low-carbohydrate diet can help mitigate the effects of pyruvate dehydrogenase deficiency and reduce the risk of metabolic acidosis. Pyruvate dehydrogenase deficiency is a neurodegenerative disorder that is associated with abnormal mitochondrial dysfunction. The pyruvate dehydrogenase complex is a multienzyme complex that is located in the matrix of mitochondria. It acts as a catalyst in the oxidative decarboxylation process of pyruvate to acetyl CoA, which is an irreversible reaction. Pyruvate dehydrogenase deficiency is a rare genetic, life-threatening mitochondrial disorder that is associated with lactic acidosis as well as neurological and neuromuscular degeneration. Developmental delay, lethargy, and hypotonia is usually present in the patients with Pyruvate dehydrogenase complex deficiency. As fat cannot be converted to glucose and low carbohydrate intake will also lead to less production of pyruvate . So, this is the best option. Incorrect Choices: a. Lactic acid is built up in the body when pyruvate dehydrogenase deficiency is present and it causes neurological problems. Hence, high protein and low carbohydrate intake are not allowed in the case of pyruvate dehydrogenase deficiency. As protein is converted to glucose via gluconeogenesis process. b. High carbohydrate and low-fat intake is not recommended as it has carbohydrates that are unable to metabolize completely. d. This option includes only carbohydrate intake, henceforth this cannot be recommended because glucose is unable to metabolize completely.",

        "C": "Succinyl CoA",

      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "cycle and is directly involved in heme metabolism. It serves as a precursor for the synthesis of heme, which is an essential component of hemoglobin and other heme-containing proteins. Incorrect Option: Option A. Alpha-ketoglutarate: Alpha-ketoglutarate is an intermediate in the TCA (tricarboxylic acid) cycle, but it is not directly involved in heme metabolism. It participates in energy generation through the TCA cycle and is involved in amino acid metabolism. Option B. Fumarate: Fumarate is also an intermediate in the TCA cycle, but it is not directly involved in heme metabolism. It is converted to malate in the TCA cycle. Option D. Malate: Malate is an intermediate in the TCA cycle but is not directly involved in heme metabolism. It is converted to oxaloacetate, which then re-enters the TCA cycle.",
