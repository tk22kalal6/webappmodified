      "question": "A one-year-old boy presents with lethargy, poor muscle tone, and developmental delays. Blood tests reveal elevated levels of glycine. The physician suspects a defect in the glycine cleavage system. Which of the following metabolites, if found LOW, would support the diagnosis of a defective glycine cleavage system?",
      "options": {
        "A": "Serine",
        "B": "N5,N10 methylene tetrahydrofolate",
        "C": "Threonine",
        "D": "Succinyl CoA"
      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: B) N5,N10 methylene tetrahydrofolate Explanation: The glycine cleavage system directly produces N5,N10-methylene tetrahydrofolate when it breaks down glycine. A defect in this system would lead to a decreased production of this metabolite . Glycine Cleavage System Location Liver mitochondria Function Splits glycine into carbon dioxide, and ammonia, and forms N I , N¹ I -methylenetetrahydrofolate (THFA). Glycine Cleavage Complex Composed of three enzymes and an H-protein. Subunits T : Tetrahydrofolate-dependent aminotransferase P : Pyridoxal phosphate-dependent glycine decarboxylase L : Lipoamide-dependent dehydrogenase H : Hydrogen or electron transport system Co-enzymes Tetrahydrofolate (THF) Pyridoxal phosphate (PLP) Lipoamide Reaction Mechanism Glycine is broken down into CO I , NH II , and a methylene group (–CH I –). The methylene group is transferred to THF, forming N I ,N¹ I -methylenetetrahydrofolate. Reaction Glycine + H I -folate + NAD I → CO I + NH I + 5,10-CH I -H I -folate + NADH + H I Major Catabolic Pathway The glycine cleavage system is the major catabolic route for glycine. Associated Disorders Nonketotic Hyperglycinemia : Accumulation of glycine in body tissues and CNS. Primary Hyperoxaluria : Failure to break down glyoxylate leads to oxalate formation, kidney stones, and possible renal failure or hypertension. Glycinuria : A defect in kidney reabsorption causes excessive glycine in urine. Serine levels might even increase as the body tries to compensate for the glycine deficiency. (Option A) A defective glycine cleavage system is unlikely to directly impact threonine levels. (Option C) Succinyl CoA is involved in heme synthesis ; defects in glycine breakdown wouldn't impact succinyl CoA levels. (Option D)",

Glutamate Glutamate dehydrogenase (Option D) α -Ketoglutarate Histidine to α -Ketoglutarate Pathway: Role of Tetrahydrofolate (THF) Histidine is metabolised to α -ketoglutarate, which subsequently enters the TCA cycle. Role of Tetrahydrofolate (THF): Histidine is broken down into formiminoglutamate (FIGLU). THF plays a critical role in converting FIGLU to glutamate. THF Function: THF accepts the formimino group (FIG) from FIGLU to become 5-formimino tetrahydrofolate (FITHFA). As a result of losing formimino group (FIG), FIGLU becomes glutamate. Folate Deficiency Consequences: Without sufficient THF, FIGLU cannot transfer its formimino group. FIGLU builds up and is excreted in urine, especially after a histidine load. Histidine Load Test: Used to diagnose folate deficiency by detecting elevated levels of FIGLU in urine after a histidine load.",

        "D": "Conversion of Phenylalanine to Tyrosine"
      },
      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: A) Conversion of homocysteine to methionine Explanation: Macrocytic anaemia, elevated homocysteine and methylmalonic acid levels are consistent with Vitamin B12 deficiency. Conversion of homocysteine to methionine is disrupted in vitamin B12 deficiency. Vitamin B12 is a cofactor for methionine synthase, the enzyme responsible for converting homocysteine to methionine. This, in turn, forms S-adenosylmethionine, which is necessary for the synthesis of nitrogenous bases in DNA and RNA. In the absence of vitamin B12, the N5-methyltetrahydrofolate (N5-methyl THF) is trapped, leading to a functional folate deficiency and, consequently, macrocytic anaemia I . This \" methyl folate trap \" hypothesis explains why folate becomes metabolically inactive. Folate Trap: Reduction of folic acid to dihydrofolate (Option B) is catalyzed by dihydrofolate reductase and is unrelated to the vitamin B12-dependent processes. It is involved in the conversion of folic acid (the synthetic form) into its active form. Deamination of histidine to formimino glutamate (Option C) is related to folate metabolism but is more directly associated with diagnosing folate deficiency by the presence of FIGLU in the urine. Conversion of Phenylalanine to Tyrosine (Option D) is catalyzed by Phenylalanine hydroxylase, which does not require vitamin B12 as a cofactor.",

        "D": "Neomycin"
      },
      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: A) Phenylacetate Explanation: Reducing blood ammonia levels: Ammonia-Scavenging Agent: Sodium benzoate : It reacts with glycine in the liver to form hippuric acid, which is then excreted in the urine, reducing the availability of glycine. Reducing the availability of glycine shifts the equilibrium to favour glycine formation. Ammonia is used to produce glycine, therefore reducing blood ammonia levels. Phenylacetate : Conjugates with glutamine to form phenylacetylglutamine (PGA), which is then excreted in the urine, depleting glutamine levels. Glutamate production from ammonia and alpha-ketoglutarate increases to compensate for depletion. Each molecule of phenyl acetate utilises two molecules of ammonia: one for the initial glutamine conjugation and one for subsequent glutamate-to-glutamine conversion. Phenylbutyrate is a prodrug metabolised into phenylacetate. This binds with glutamine to form phenylacetylglutamine and is excreted by the kidneys, removing excess nitrogen and ammonia. Protein degradation : Adequate caloric intake can help prevent protein breakdown and, subsequently, ammonia production. Urease-producing microorganisms : Certain bacteria in the gut produce urease, an enzyme that breaks down urea into ammonia. To prevent this, Low-dose neomycin : Helps suppress the growth of urease-producing bacteria. (Option D) Lactulose: Converts ammonia into ammonium ions, which cannot be easily absorbed, thus reducing the amount of ammonia. (Option C) N-acetyl glutamate is used to treat hyperammonemia but does not directly scavenge ammonia .

      "explanation": "Correct Answer: A) Transfer an amino group to one keto acid, producing new amino and keto acids. aminotransferases with Pyridoxal Phosphate (PLP) as a coenzyme. Transamination Process Transfer of an α -amino group from an amino acid to one keto acid, producing a new α -keto acid and a new amino acid. (Option A) The first step is the catabolism of most amino acids. All amino acids, except Proline, hydroxyproline, threonine, and lysine, participate in transamination . (Option B) Biological Importance Amino Acid Interconversion: Maintains balance of non-essential amino acids by transferring amino groups to synthesise needed amino acids. Ammonia Disposal: Detoxifies ammonia by funnelling amino groups into glutamate, which is deaminated in the liver for excretion. Glutamate's Role α -Ketoglutarate: Acts as an acceptor of amino groups from most amino acids, converting to glutamate. Transamination occurs in the cytoplasm; the amino group is transported to the liver as glutamate. (Option D) Oxidative Deamination: Glutamate undergoes rapid oxidative deamination in the mitochondria to form α -ketoglutarate, which can accept another amino group. Enzymes Aminotransferases (Transaminases): Catalyse the transfer of amino groups between carbon skeletons. They are not coenzymes. (Option C) Alanine Aminotransferase (ALT): Transfers amino group from alanine to α -ketoglutarate, forming pyruvate and glutamate. Aspartate Aminotransferase (AST): Transfers amino groups from glutamate to oxaloacetate, forming aspartate used in the urea cycle. Coenzyme Pyridoxal Phosphate (PLP): Required by all aminotransferases, derived from vitamin B6. Reversibility Transamination reactions are reversible, with equilibrium constants near 1.

      "explanation": "Correct Answer: D) Lysine Explanation: Serine, Threonine and Alanine are sources of Glycine, whereas Lysine is not. Glycine Simple, non-essential amino acid. Acts as a precursor for metabolites like creatine, glutathione, heme, purines, and porphyrins. Vital for protein synthesis, collagen structure , neurotransmission, immune response, and lipid digestion. Sources of Glycine: Serine : Converted to glycine via serine hydroxymethyltransferase (SMT), present in mitochondria and cytoplasm. (Option A) Threonine : Converted to glycine by threonine aldolase. (Option B) Choline : Converted to glycine via sarcosine and betaine pathways. Glycine Synthase : Synthesises glycine from CO I , NH II , and a one-carbon unit. This multi-enzyme complex requires NAD, lipoamide, tetrahydrofolic acid, and pyridoxal phosphate. This is a reversal of the glycine cleavage system. Glycine Aminotransferase : Catalyses glycine synthesis from glyoxylate and glutamate or alanine.

Explanation: The carbamoyl phosphate synthetase I (CPS I) reaction is the rate-limiting step in the urea cycle. The urea cycle is a cycle of biochemical reactions that produce urea from ammonia. It is also known as the Krebs-Henseleit urea cycle or the Ornithine cycle. It starts in the mitochondria of hepatocytes and ends in the cytoplasm . Reactions in the Urea Cycle Step Reaction Details Enzyme Involved and Location Key Points Carbamoyl Phosphate Formation Formation of carbamoyl phosphate from ammonia and CO I using ATP. Carbamoyl Phosphate Synthetase I (CPS I) Mitochondria The rate-limiting step of the urea cycle. Irreversible and allosterically regulated by N-acetyl glutamate (NAG). Citrulline Formation (Option A) Transfer of carbamoyl phosphate to ornithine to form citrulline.

      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: C) Glutamine and alanine transport ammonia to the liver. Explanation: Ammonia is transported in a non-toxic form in the circulation as glutamine or alanine. Glutamine is formed from glutamate and ammonia by glutamine synthetase, primarily in skeletal muscle, liver, and CNS. Glutamine transports ammonia from the brain and intestine to the liver. (Option A) Glutamine is transported in the blood to the liver, where it is cleaved by glutaminase to glutamate and ammonia. The glutamate is oxidatively deaminated to ammonia and α -ketoglutarate by glutamate dehydrogenase (GDH), and the ammonia is converted to urea. Alanine is the transport form of ammonia from muscle to the liver. (Option B) Alanine transports ammonia to the liver via the glucose-alanine cycle. (Option D) Alanine is transported in the blood to the liver, where it is transaminated by alanine transaminase(ALT) to pyruvate. The pyruvate is used to synthesise glucose, which can enter the blood and be used by muscles. The glutamate product of ALT can be deaminated by GDH, generating ammonia. Thus, both alanine and glutamine carry ammonia to the liver. Transporter Formation Process Source Destination Mechanism/Role Glutamine Formed from glutamate and ammonia by glutamine synthetase . Skeletal muscle, liver, CNS Liver, kidneys Transports ammonia from the brain and intestine to the liver. In the liver, glutamine is cleaved by glutaminase to release ammonia and glutamate. Glutamate is then deaminated by glutamate dehydrogenase (GDH) , releasing additional ammonia, which enters the urea cycle for detoxification. Alanine Formed from pyruvate and ammonia in muscles during the glucose-alanine cycle . Muscles Liver Transports ammonia from muscle to the liver. In the liver, alanine is transaminated by alanine transaminase (ALT) to form pyruvate and glutamate. The pyruvate is used to synthesize glucose, and the glutamate can be deaminated by GDH to release ammonia for the urea cycle.

Ammonia Management in Neurons: Ammonia can be neurotoxic if accumulated. Glutamine Synthesis: Produced in neurons as a byproduct of amino acid metabolism and neurotransmitter turnover. Ammonia reacts with α -ketoglutarate and NADH to form glutamate, catalyzed by glutamate dehydrogenase. α -ketoglutarate + NH 3 I I + NADH → Glutamate + NAD + + H2 I O Glutamate is converted to glutamine by glutamine synthetase, adding another ammonia molecule. Glutamine synthetase is predominantly found in astrocytes. Glutamate + NH 3 I + ATP → Glutamine + ADP + Pi This conversion reduces ammonia toxicity by storing it in a non-toxic form. The fate of glutamine: Release into the Bloodstream: Glutamine is released into the extracellular space and enters the bloodstream. This transport helps maintain nitrogen balance and prevents ammonia accumulation. Transport to the Liver: Glutamine carries ammonia from the brain to the liver, where it is deaminated to release ammonia. Ammonia enters the urea cycle in the liver for detoxification. Importance of Glutamine in Neuronal Health: Acts as a non-toxic ammonia carrier, preventing neurotoxicity. Serves as a precursor for neurotransmitters like GABA , maintaining neurotransmitter balance.

Hydroxyproline Derived from proline through post-translational modification; shares the same structural limitation. Lysine Has an epsilon-amino group in its side chain, which can form Schiff bases, potentially interfering with transamination. Threonine Loses its α -amino group through deamination rather than transamination. Direct transamination does not occur; instead, it is converted to alpha-ketobutyric acid.

Explanation: Oxidative deamination removes the alpha-amino group from an amino acid, producing a keto acid and ammonia. This reaction, catalysed by glutamate dehydrogenase in liver mitochondria, is essential for ammonia detoxification and nitrogen balance. The ammonia formed is detoxified in the form of glutamate. The ammonia generated is processed through the urea cycle for excretion. (Option C) Oxidative Deamination: Process: Removes alpha-amino group from an amino acid, producing a keto acid and ammonia. Common Amino Acid: Glutamic acid. Enzyme: Glutamate dehydrogenase ( GDH ). Transdeamination: Step 1: Transamination (all organs) in cytoplasm forms glutamate. (Option D) Step 2 (Oxidative decarboxylation): In liver mitochondria, GDH removes the amino group from glutamate, producing alpha-ketoglutarate and ammonia. (Option B) Significance: It ensures efficient ammonia disposal, funnelling ammonia into the liver for detoxification via the urea cycle. Minor deamination Pathways: Involve enzymes like L-amino acid oxidase and D-amino acid oxidase. Non-oxidative deamination targets specific amino acids, releasing ammonia. L-Amino Acid Oxidase: It deaminates L-amino acids in the kidney. It generates hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) and ammonia as by-products. H2O2, a reactive oxygen species (ROS), is broken down into O2 and H2O by catalase to mitigate damage from ROS.",
