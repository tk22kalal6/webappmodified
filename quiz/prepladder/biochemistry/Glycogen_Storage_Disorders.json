      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: C) Debranching Enzyme Explanation: Debranching Enzymes play a crucial role in glycogenolysis by removing the branches from the glycogen molecule. It has two activities : it transfers a short segment of glucose from a branch to a nearby chain and hydrolyzes the remaining glucose unit at the branch point, thus converting branched glycogen into a more linear form that can be further degraded. Transferase Activity : Moves a segment of 3 glucose units from the branch to the main chain α -1,6-Glucosidase Activity : Hydrolyzes the remaining α -1,6-glycosidic bond at the branch point ↓ Free Glucose (from the α -1,6-glycosidic bond) Glycogen Phosphorylase ( Option A) catalyzes the cleavage of glycogen into glucose-1-phosphate units by adding a phosphate group. It acts on the linear chains of glycogen, not the branches, and does not convert branched structures into linear ones. Branching Enzyme(Option B) is involved in the synthesis of glycogen, specifically in the creation of branch points by transferring a segment of the glycogen chain to a new location. It is not involved in converting branched structures into linear structures during glycogenolysis. Glycogen Synthase(Option D) is responsible for the synthesis of glycogen from glucose-1-phosphate by forming α -1,4-glycosidic bonds. It is involved in building glycogen rather than breaking it down and does not affect the branched structure of glycogen. Reference: Harper’s Illustrated Biochemistry (23rd Edition), Page 174.

      },
      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "anaerobic glycolysis (glycogen → lactate), the net ATP yield differs from glucose metabolism because glycogen breakdown bypasses the hexokinase step , which normally consumes ATP. Here’s a stepwise explanation: Glycogenolysis (Breakdown of Glycogen) Glycogen phosphorylase removes glucose units from glycogen as glucose-1-phosphate (G1P) . Phosphoglucomutase converts G1P to glucose-6-phosphate (G6P) . Since G6P is directly obtained, it skips the hexokinase step (which normally consumes 1 ATP in glucose metabolism). Glycolysis (Conversion of Glucose-6-Phosphate to Pyruvate) G6P enters glycolysis and follows the usual pathway. Key ATP-related steps: Energy investment: 1 ATP is used at the phosphofructokinase-1 (PFK-1) step. Energy generation: 4 ATP are produced from substrate-level phosphorylation . Net ATP gain from glycolysis: 4 ATP (produced) - 1 ATP (used) = 3 ATP . Anaerobic Conditions (Conversion of Pyruvate to Lactate) In anaerobic exercise (e.g., intense training), pyruvate is converted to lactate by lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) . This step does not produce or consume ATP ; its main role is regenerating NAD I for continued glycolysis. ATP Yield Calculation from Muscle Glycogen Breakdown Step Process ATP Change Glycogenolysis Glycogen → Glucose-1-phosphate → Glucose-6-phosphate (no ATP used) +0 ATP Glycolysis Glucose-6-phosphate → 2 Pyruvate +4 ATP Energy Consumption ATP used in glycolysis (Phosphofructokinase-1 step) -1 ATP Anaerobic Conversion 2 Pyruvate → 2 Lactate (No ATP change) 0 ATP Net ATP Yield 3 ATP Final Net ATP Yield: Glycolysis from muscle glycogen produces 3 ATP (instead of 2 ATP when starting from free glucose) because the hexokinase step is bypassed. No additional ATP is lost or gained during lactate formation. Total ATP yield per glycogen molecule → 3 ATP. 1 ATP (Option A): Incorrect because the actual ATP yield is higher . Even free glucose metabolism yields 2 ATP , and muscle glycogen yields 3 ATP due to bypassing hexokinase. 2 ATP (Option B): Incorrect because this is the ATP yield when glucose (not glycogen) is used . Muscle glycogen metabolism produces one extra ATP by skipping the ATP-consuming hexokinase step. 4 ATP (Option D): Incorrect because glycolysis does produce 4 ATP, but 1 ATP is consumed at the PFK-1 step , leading to a net gain of 3 ATP, not 4 .

      "explanation": "of glycogen into glucose-1-phosphate. There are two main isoforms of glycogen phosphorylase: Glycogen Phosphorylase A (Liver isoform) and Glycogen Phosphorylase B (Muscle isoform) Liver Glycogen Phosphorylase (LGP) is primarily regulated by glucagon and epinephrine , which promote glycogen breakdown to maintain blood glucose levels during fasting. Muscle Glycogen Phosphorylase (MGP) is activated by epinephrine and allosterically regulated by AMP , which signals low energy and promotes glycogenolysis for ATP production in muscle cells. Aspect Liver Glycogen Phosphorylase (Liver-specific isoform) Muscle Glycogen Phosphorylase (Muscle-specific isoform) Primary Role Maintains blood glucose levels by breaking down glycogen during fasting Provides glucose for ATP production during muscle contraction.

MGP does not release free glucose since muscle lacks glucose-6-phosphatase . Instead, glucose-6-phosphate enters glycolysis for ATP production within muscle cells. LGP activity is regulated by AMP, while MGP is regulated by glucagon and epinephrine (Option C): Incorrect because AMP primarily regulates MGP, not LGP . AMP increases MGP activity when energy levels are low. LGP is regulated by glucagon and epinephrine, not AMP . MGP is highly active during fasting compared to LGP (Option D): Incorrect because LGP is highly active during fasting to maintain blood glucose levels . MGP is more active during exercise , when ATP demand is high, not necessarily during fasting. Reference: Harper’s Illustrated Biochemistry (32nd Edition), Page 173-177.

      "correct_answer": "D",
      "explanation": "phosphorolytic cleavage of α -1,4 glycosidic bonds in glycogen, releasing glucose-1-phosphate. It is regulated by phosphorylation: Activated by phosphorylase kinase and inhibited by phosphoprotein phosphatase. Different isoforms exist in the liver, muscle, and brain. Requires pyridoxal phosphate (PLP) as a coenzyme. Glycogenolysis Feature Details Definition Breakdown of glycogen to release glucose Location Primarily in liver and muscle Purpose Provides glucose for energy during fasting (liver) and muscle contraction (muscle) Rate-Limiting Enzyme Glycogen phosphorylase End Products Glucose-1-phosphate (converted to glucose-6-phosphate, then to glucose in liver) Steps of Glycogenolysis Glycogen phosphorylase: Cleaves α -1,4 glycosidic bonds and releases glucose-1-phosphate . Rate-limiting enzyme , activated by phosphorylation. Debranching enzyme (Glucan transferase & α -1,6-glucosidase): Transfers trisaccharide units to the main chain (glucan transferase). Hydrolyzes α -1,6 glycosidic bonds to release free glucose. Phosphoglucomutase: Converts glucose-1-phosphate to glucose-6-phosphate . Glucose-6-phosphatase (Liver only): Converts glucose-6-phosphate to free glucose , which is released into the blood. Regulation of Glycogenolysis Factor Effect on Glycogenolysis Glucagon (Liver) Stimulates Epinephrine (Muscle & Liver) Stimulates Insulin Inhibits AMP (Muscle) Stimulates ATP, Glucose-6-P Inhibits Glycogenolysis in muscle provides glucose-6-phosphate for glycolysis , not free glucose. Glycogenolysis in liver maintains blood glucose levels during fasting. Rate-Limiting Enzymes in Carbohydrate Metabolism Pathway Rate-Limiting Enzyme Key Regulation Glycolysis Phosphofructokinase-1 (PFK-1) Activated by AMP, fructose-2,6-bisphosphate; Inhibited by ATP, citrate Gluconeogenesis Fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase Activated by ATP, inhibited by AMP, fructose-2,6-bisphosphate Glycogenesis Glycogen synthase Activated by insulin, glucose-6-phosphate; Inhibited by glucagon, epinephrine Glycogenolysis Glycogen phosphorylase Activated by glucagon, epinephrine, AMP; Inhibited by insulin, ATP, glucose-6-phosphate Pentose Phosphate Pathway (HMP Shunt) Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) Activated by NADP I ; Inhibited by NADPH TCA Cycle Isocitrate dehydrogenase Activated by ADP, Ca² I ; Inhibited by ATP, NADH These rate-limiting enzymes regulate carbohydrate metabolism by controlling the flux of substrates through their respective pathways based on energy demands and hormonal signals. Phosphoglucomutase (Option A): Incorrect because it converts glucose-1-phosphate to glucose-6-phosphate, which is not the rate-limiting step. Glucose-6-phosphatase (Option B): Incorrect because it converts glucose-6-phosphate to free glucose in the liver but is not involved in the rate-limiting step of glycogenolysis. Glucan transferase (Option C): Incorrect because it helps in debranching glycogen by transferring trisaccharide units but does not control the rate of glycogen breakdown.

      },
      "correct_answer": "D",
      "explanation": "Glycogenolysis involves breaking down glycogen into glucose-1-phosphate, whereas glycogenesis involves synthesizing glycogen from glucose-1-phosphate. Glucose-6-phosphatase acts in the liver (Option A). This enzyme functions in glycogenolysis by converting glucose-6-phosphate into free glucose, which is then released into the bloodstream. Glycogen phosphorylase cleaves α -1,4 linkages (Option B): Glycogen phosphorylase cleaves α -1,4 glycosidic bonds in glycogen during glycogenolysis, releasing glucose-1-phosphate from glycogen. Phosphoglucomutase converts glucose-1-phosphate into glucose-6-phosphate (Option C) : Phosphoglucomutase catalyzes the reversible conversion of glucose-1-phosphate into glucose-6-phosphate.Glucose-6-phosphate can enter glycolysis for energy production or be converted into free glucose in the liver by glucose-6-phosphatase.
