      "question": "A child presents with erythematous scaly patches in the perioral region, mucosal ulcers, and impaired epithelial wound healing. The most likely mineral deficiency associated with this condition is",
      "options": {
        "A": "Iron deficiency",
        "B": "Zinc deficiency",
        "C": "Calcium deficiency",
        "D": "Copper deficiency"
      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: B) Zinc deficiency Explanation: The above scenario is suggestive of Zinc deficiency. Zinc Deficiency Manifestations: Poor Wound Healing Skin Lesions: Rashes, dermatitis, and hyperkeratosis. Alopecia. Impaired Spermatogenesis. Immune Dysfunction: Decreased T and B lymphocyte counts ; impaired macrophage function. Neurological Effects: Depression, dementia, and other psychiatric disorders. Zinc also forms plaques with amyloid in Alzheimer's disease . Acrodermatitis Enteropathica: A genetic condition characterized by: Inflammation around the mouth, nose, and fingers. Diarrhea. Hair loss. Ophthalmoplegia and hypogonadism. Iron deficiency (Option A): Iron deficiency typically causes symptoms like pallor, fatigue, and glossitis but does not result in scaly patches or impaired wound healing. Calcium deficiency (Option C): Calcium deficiency primarily affects bone health, leading to rickets in children or osteomalacia in adults. Skin or mucosal symptoms are not characteristic. Copper deficiency (Option D): Copper deficiency can cause anemia, neutropenia, and neurological deficits. It is associated with poor connective tissue integrity (e.g., kinky hair in Menkes disease) but does not cause scaly patches or mucosal ulcers.

      "question": "Which of the following minerals is best known for insulin secretion stabilisation?",
      "options": {
        "A": "Cadmium",
        "B": "Copper",
        "C": "Iron",
        "D": "Zinc"
      },
      "correct_answer": "D",
      "explanation": "numerous biological processes, including insulin secretion and stabilization. It is involved in the synthesis, storage, and release of insulin from pancreatic beta cells. Zinc also helps in maintaining the structure and stability of insulin molecules. Zinc : Dietary Sources Grains, beans, nuts, cheese, meat, shellfish. Therapeutic Use Zinc reduces copper absorption in Wilson’s disease. Zinc-Dependent Enzymes Carboxypeptidase Carbonic anhydrase Alkaline phosphatase Lactate dehydrogenase Ethanol dehydrogenase Glutamate dehydrogenase RNA polymerase (required for protein biosynthesis) Functions Antioxidant RoleExtracellular superoxide dismutase is zinc-dependent, contributing to zinc’s antioxidant properties. Insulin and ZincZinc stabilizes insulin in beta cells of the pancreas but is not present in released insulin. Taste Sensation Gusten, a zinc-containing protein in saliva, is important for taste sensation. Deficiency Manifestations Poor wound healing Skin lesions, hyperkeratosis, dermatitis, alopecia Impaired spermatogenesis Reduced T and B lymphocyte numbers, impaired macrophage function Psychiatric disorders: depression, dementia, and cognitive decline (e.g., Alzheimer's) Acrodermatitis Enteropathica Acrodermatitis (inflammation around mouth, nose, fingers, etc.) Diarrhea, alopecia, ophthalmoplegia, hypogonadism Toxicity Manifestations Chronic Toxicity: Gastric ulcers, pancreatitis, anemia, nausea, vomiting, pulmonary fibrosis Acute Toxicity: Fever, excessive salivation, headache, anemia Cadmium (Option A) is a toxic heavy metal that can have detrimental effects on health, including disrupting various physiological processes. Copper (Option B) is an essential trace mineral that plays a role in various bodily functions, including the formation of red blood cells and maintaining connective tissues. While it is involved in several enzymatic reactions. Iron (Option C) is vital for oxygen transport in the blood and is a key component of hemoglobin. Reference: Vasudevan Edition 7 page no:522",

      "question": "Menke's disease is due to a deficiency of:",
      "options": {
        "A": "Zinc",
        "B": "Copper",
        "C": "Iron",
        "D": "Magnesium"
      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Correct answer: B) Copper Explanation: Menke's disease occurs due to a deficiency of copper due to a defect in the absorption of copper from the intestine. Menkes disease (also called kinky hair disease) is a rare, X-linked genetic disorder caused by a deficiency in copper absorption due to mutations in the ATP7A gene. Key features: Brittle, kinky hair Growth failure Neurodegeneration (seizures, developmental delay) Pathophysiology: Copper is essential for enzymes like lysyl oxidase (collagen cross-linking) and cytochrome c oxidase (cellular respiration). Impaired copper transport leads to systemic deficiency, affecting enzyme functions. The copper gets trapped in the metallothionine present in the intestinal cells. This prevents the copper from being absorbed into the bloodstream. The symptoms of Menke's disease include reduced copper in plasma and urine, anemia and depigmentation of hair. Can be treated by copper replacement therapy. Reference: Menke disease",

        "A": "Manganese",
        "B": "Selenium",
        "C": "Copper",

      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: B) Selenium Explanation : Selenium (Se) is an essential micronutrient for an antioxidant defence that integrates an important part of selenoproteins. The most well-known selenoproteins are five glutathione peroxidases (GPx), which protect cells from damage caused by free radicals such as reactive oxygen species (ROS). Reduce lipid hydroperoxides to their corresponding alcohols and to reduce free hydrogen peroxide to water. Manganese (Option A): Not the cofactor for glutathione peroxidase.It is a cofactor for manganese superoxide dismutase, arginase, and pyruvate carboxylase. Copper (Option C): Cofactor and regulator of copper, zinc superoxide dismutase. Magnesium (Option D): Cofactor in ATP-generating reactions. Reference: Glutathione peroxidase",

        "B": "Selenium",
        "C": "lodine",

      },
      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: A) Calcium Explanation: Minerals are crucial for normal growth and body maintenance. Those required in amounts greater than 100 mg/day are called macrominerals or major elements , while those needed in smaller amounts (less than 100 mg/day) are known as microminerals , trace elements , or minor elements . Calcium is classified as a macromineral (major element), not a micromineral. It is required by the body in large amounts (greater than 100 mg/day) for functions like bone formation, muscle contraction, and nerve transmission. Macrominerals Microminerals (Trace elements) Calcium (Option A) Magnesium Phosphorus Sodium Potassium Chloride Sulfur Iron Iodine (Option C ruled out) Copper (Option D ruled out) Manganese Zinc Molybdenum Selenium (Option B ruled out) Fluoride Reference: Vasudevan 7th edition Pg no. 502, 503",
