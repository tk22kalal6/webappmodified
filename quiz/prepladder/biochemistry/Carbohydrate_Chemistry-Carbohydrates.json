      "explanation": "content. Correct Answer: B) Proteoglycans have long mucopolysaccharide chains and are characterized by their high carbohydrate content. Explanation : Proteoglycans contain long mucopolysaccharide chains, are negatively charged due to sulfated or acetylated groups, and have higher carbohydrate content compared to glycoproteins, which have shorter oligosaccharide chains and are less negatively charged. Property Glycoproteins Proteoglycans Carbohydrates content Low High Basic difference Oligosaccharide chain Mucopolysaccharide chain Charge Not negatively charged Negatively charged sulfated or acetylated Location Plasma proteins Cellular receptors – except albumin Receptors made up of simple proteins can not be heterogenous, as simple proteins are made up of just 2- aminoacids which can be linked by peptide linkages.

      "question": "A 15-year-old girl is brought to the clinic by her parents because she is more fatigued than usual and frequently thirsty. A urinalysis reveals positive results for Benedict's test, Barfoed's test, and Glucose Oxidase Peroxidase Test are also positive. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?",

      },
      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: A) Diabetes Mellitus Explanation: The most probable diagnosis, considering the symptoms and test results, is Diabetes Mellitus , indicated by the presence of glucose as a reducing monosaccharide in the urine. The positive results in both Benedict’s and Barfoed’s tests support this conclusion. It is further verified by a positive Glucose Oxidase Peroxidase Test (GOD-POD). Algorithm for detecting sugars in urine: Test Purpose Interpretation Benedict's Test Detects reducing substances in urine. Positive indicates presence of reducing sugars, but not specific for monosaccharides. Barfoed's Test Differentiates between reducing monosaccharides and other sugars. Positive indicates reducing monosaccharides (e.g., glucose, fructose, galactose). Glucose Oxidase Peroxidase Test (GOD-POD) Specifically tests for glucose presence. Positive confirms glucose, supporting diagnosis of diabetes mellitus. Seliwanoff Test Distinguishes ketoses like fructose from aldoses like glucose. Positive indicates fructose; observed in essential fructosuria if combined with other symptoms. Mucic Acid Test Identifies galactose in the urine. Positive confirms galactose, supporting a diagnosis of classical galactosemia. Bial's Test Identifies pentoses in the urine. Used for diagnosing conditions like essential pentosuria. Other options: Essential Fructosuria (Option B) would show a negative Glucose Oxidase Peroxidase Test test. Lactose due to pregnancy and lactation (Option C) would show a negative Barfoed's test, and generally would have history and features of pregnancy. Classical Galactosemia (Option D) would also show a negative Glucose Oxidase Peroxidase Test test. Reference: Vasudevan’s Textbook of Biochemistry for Medical Students, 7th Edition, Page 316, 317.",

Lactose forms Hedgehog or “Pincushion with pins” or “flower of touch-me-not plant” shaped Lactosazones, with an excess of Phenylhydrazine when kept at boiling temperature. Sugar Crystal Shape Notes Lactose (Option B) Hedgehog or “Pincushion with pins” or “flower of touch-me-not plant” Indicates lactose presence, as seen in galactosemia. Glucose (Option A) Fructose Needle-shaped crystals arranged like a broom Often associated with conditions like Diabetes Mellitus. Maltose (Option C) Sunflower-shaped or Petal-shaped Takes longer time to form, associated with menopausal status in women.

The reagent used is cupric acetate in an acetic acid solution. It is weakly acidic and is reduced by only monosaccharides. A false positive result can occur with prolonged boiling of disaccharides. Monosaccharides react with this reagent within 5 minutes to give a brick-red precipitate of copper (I) oxide . Disaccharides take a longer time to react because the aldehyde function is masked in the acetal linkage and gives an orange-red color.

      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Correct answer: B) Orange Explanation: The presence of reducing sugars is detected by Benedict’s test which is a blue solution that turns its color in the range from green to yellow to orange to red according to the concentration of the reducing sugars. A positive Benedict’s test : change in color from blue to green / yellow / orange / red A negative Benedict’s test : no change in color. The reagent here is Benedict's solution which contains sodium carbonate, copper sulphate, and sodium citrate . The copper sulfate gives it a blue color. In an alkaline medium, sugars form enediol that in turn reduces the cupric ions in the reagent. This changes the color of the reagent. Any sugar with a free aldehyde or keto group will reduce the Benedict’s reagent and hence this is not a reliable test for detecting glucose in urine. Disaccharides like sucrose don't react with the reagent as such but only after hydrolysis of sucrose does it give a positive test result. This is a specific test for detecting sucrose.

Since diastereomers differ at one or more (but not all) chiral centres and are not mirror images , xylose and arabinose qualify as diastereoisomers , not epimers . Optical Isomerism (Option A) : Two molecules with same molecular formula, but differ in the way they turn the plain polarised lights. The orientation of the —H an —OH groups around the carbon atom adjacent to the terminal alcohol carbon (carbon 5 in glucose) etermines whether the sugar beongs to the d or l series.

A deficiency or dysfunction in dermatan sulfate can lead to issues with the structural integrity of the skin and blood vessels, resulting in symptoms such as hyperextensible skin and increased vascular fragility.

      "explanation": "Correct Answer: B) Keratan sulfate Explanation: The image depicts Keratan sulfate , identifiable by its unique composition of galactose and N-acetylglucosamine , along with possible sulfate groups. It is unique among glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) because it lacks uronic acid I . It is primarily found in the cornea and cartilage, contributing to their structural properties I . Identification Tips: Look for the presence of galactose as one of the primary sugars in the disaccharide unit. N-acetylglucosamine can be identified by the presence of the N-acetyl group (CH I CONH). Sulfate groups may be attached to either of the sugar moieties, contributing to the molecule's negative charge.

Keratan sulfate (Option A) Repeating units are galactose and N-acetyl glucosamine in beta linkage. Chondroitin sulfate (Option B) Repeating units of glucuronic acid → beta-1,3-N-acetyl galactosamine sulfate → beta-1,4 and so on. Dermatan sulfate (Option C) It Contains L-iduronic acid and N-acetyl galactosamine in beta-1, 3 linkages.

      "explanation": "Correct answer: B) Hydrogen breath test Explanation: The diagnosis here points to lactose intolerance , a digestion defect caused by the enzyme lactase deficiency . It presents with symptoms like osmotic diarrhoea, flatulence, bloating, and frothy stools. The investigation of choice for lactose intolerance is the Hydrogen breath test and methane breath test. Other tests include: Stool acidity test : Unabsorbed lactose is fermented by colonic bacteria into lactic acid, lowering stool pH. Dietary elimination : Elimination of certain foods reduces the symptoms. Milk tolerance test : 500ml milk to be consumed and to note the blood glucose level to see malabsorption Lactose tolerance test: Checks lactose absorption after consuming a lactose-containing liquid.

Examples include sucrose and trehalose, where the glycosidic bond involves the reducing ends. They do not react with Benedict's or Fehling's solutions. However, after acid hydrolysis, they can be converted to reducing sugars, giving a positive result in these tests. Non-reducing sugars are significant in various biological and nutritional contexts.
