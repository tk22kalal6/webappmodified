      "explanation": ", leading to excessive oxaloacetate (OAA) utilization for glucose production. This depletes oxaloacetate , a key intermediate in the TCA cycle , causing suppression of the cycle despite an abundance of acetyl-CoA . Excess acetyl-CoA is then diverted to ketogenesis , leading to ketoacidosis . Role of Oxaloacetate in the TCA Cycle Function Effect in Uncontrolled Diabetes Combines with acetyl-CoA to form citrate Depleted due to increased gluconeogenesis Essential for TCA cycle continuation Suppression of the TCA cycle Deficiency leads to ketone body formation Ketogenesis → Ketoacidosis Acetyl-CoA (Option A): Incorrect because acetyl-CoA accumulates due to β -oxidation but cannot enter the TCA cycle without oxaloacetate . Succinyl-CoA (Option C): Incorrect because its levels are not significantly affected in diabetes; it plays a role in the TCA cycle but is not a primary regulator. Malate (Option D): Incorrect because malate can be converted to oxaloacetate , but oxaloacetate is preferentially diverted to gluconeogenesis , leading to depletion.

This is necessary because the inner mitochondrial membrane is impermeable to NADH , preventing its direct transport. Malate Shuttle: The malate shuttle, or malate-aspartate shuttle , is a biochemical system that facilitates the transport of electrons from the cytosol to the mitochondria. It is crucial for oxidative phosphorylation, as the mitochondrial inner membrane is impermeable to NADH, the primary reducing equivalent of the electron transport chain.

Generation of Reducing Equivalents: The cycle generates NADH and FADH2, which are essential for the electron transport chain and subsequent ATP production. 2. Anabolic Role (Biosynthesis) Citrate for Fatty Acid Synthesis : Citrate from the TCA cycle is exported to the cytoplasm and cleaved to provide acetyl-CoA for fatty acid synthesis. α -Ketoglutarate for Amino Acid Synthesis : α -Ketoglutarate is transaminated to form glutamate, which can be converted to glutamine, proline, and arginine. Succinyl-CoA for Heme Synthesis: Succinyl-CoA and glycine participate in the synthesis of δ -aminolevulinic acid (ALA) , the first step in heme biosynthesis.

Since one glucose produces 2 Acetyl-CoA, we double the ATP yield . Total ATP from Citric Acid Cycle per glucose = 20 ATP . Citric Acid Cycle (Krebs Cycle) The Citric Acid Cycle (TCA cycle, Krebs cycle) is a central metabolic pathway that occurs in the mitochondria and plays a crucial role in energy production, biosynthesis, and metabolic regulation. Feature Details Location Mitochondrial matrix Purpose Oxidation of Acetyl-CoA to generate ATP, NADH, and FADH I Entry Molecule Acetyl-CoA (from glycolysis, fatty acid oxidation, or amino acid metabolism) End Products per Cycle 3 NADH (Produces 7.5 ATP) 1 FADH I (Produces 1.5 ATP) 1 ATP (GTP) 2 CO I (Byproduct) ATP Yield per Glucose 20 ATP (from 2 Acetyl-CoA) Regulatory Enzymes Citrate Synthase (Inhibited by ATP, NADH, and Succinyl-CoA) Isocitrate Dehydrogenase (Rate-limiting step, inhibited by ATP and NADH) α -Ketoglutarate Dehydrogenase (Inhibited by ATP, NADH, and Succinyl-CoA) Significance Provides intermediates for biosynthesis (e.g., amino acids, heme, fatty acids) Generates reducing equivalents (NADH, FADH I ) for the electron transport chain Integrates carbohydrate, lipid, and protein metabolism Steps in the Citric Acid Cycle: Step Reaction Enzyme ATP/NADH/FADH I Produced 1 Acetyl-CoA + Oxaloacetate → Citrate Citrate Synthase - 2 Citrate → Isocitrate Aconitase - 3 Isocitrate → α -Ketoglutarate + CO I Isocitrate Dehydrogenase 1 NADH (2.5 ATP) 4 α -Ketoglutarate → Succinyl-CoA + CO I α -Ketoglutarate Dehydrogenase 1 NADH (2.5 ATP) 5 Succinyl-CoA → Succinate Succinyl-CoA Synthetase 1 ATP (GTP) 6 Succinate → Fumarate Succinate Dehydrogenase 1 FADH I (1.5 ATP) 7 Fumarate → Malate Fumarase - 8 Malate → Oxaloacetate Malate Dehydrogenase 1 NADH (2.5 ATP) Regulation of the Citric Acid Cycle: Regulator Effect on TCA Cycle Mechanism ATP Inhibits High energy status NADH Inhibits High reducing equivalents ADP Activates Low energy status Ca² I Activates Stimulates muscle contraction and energy demand Integration with Other Pathways: Gluconeogenesis : Oxaloacetate is a precursor. Fatty Acid Synthesis : Citrate provides acetyl-CoA for lipogenesis. Amino Acid Metabolism : Intermediates serve as precursors for non-essential amino acids. Urea Cycle : Fumarate and Aspartate link TCA with nitrogen metabolism. The TCA cycle is a central hub for metabolism, connecting multiple biochemical pathways and ensuring efficient ATP production.

      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "δ -aminolevulinic acid (ALA), the first step in heme synthesis. In the heme synthesis, succinyl-CoA combines with glycine to form δ -aminolevulinic acid (ALA), the first step. Succinyl-CoA is replenished via anaplerotic reactions involving amino acids like Valine, Isoleucine, and Methionine , which are converted to Propionyl-CoA before forming Succinyl-CoA. Propionyl CoA from odd fatty acid breakdown enters the pathway by converting to Succinyl CoA. Citrate (Option A) is a 6-carbon molecule formed from acetyl-CoA and oxaloacetate. Citrate serves as an intermediate in the TCA cycle and plays a key role in fatty acid and cholesterol synthesis by transporting acetyl-CoA from the mitochondria to the cytoplasm. α -Ketoglutarate (Option B) is a 5-carbon molecule involved in amino acid metabolism and serves as an intermediate in the Krebs Cycle. It undergoes a Transamination Reaction to form Glutamate, which is a Reversible reaction.( α -Ketoglutarate ↔ Glutamate) Glutamate is derived from α -ketoglutarate and can be synthesized from Histidine, Proline, Arginine, and Glutamine via transamination and deamination reactions. Malate (Option D ): Malate is an intermediate in the Krebs Cycle, formed from fumarate and converted into oxaloacetate. Malate can be converted to pyruvate by Malic Enzyme, generating NADPH , which is crucial for fatty acid synthesis. It is crucial as pyruvate can yield both Acetyl CoA (Pyruvate dehydrogenase) and Oxaloacetate (Pyruvate carboxylase), enabling their entry into the Citric cycle.

      "explanation": "α -Ketoglutarate Dehydrogenase (Step 4). Both involve oxidation and removal of CO I and produce NADH, which is later used in oxidative phosphorylation. Steps 3 and 4 are catalysed by Succinate dehydrogenase, and Malate Dehydrogenase catalyzes the oxidation of malate to oxaloacetate, producing NADH, which enters oxidative phosphorylation.

Iron (Fe² I ) is a cofactor for Aconitase, which catalyzes the isomerization of citrate to isocitrate. α -Ketoglutarate Dehydrogenase: It is a Multienzyme complex involving 3 subunits and requires 5 Cofactors: Thiamine pyrophosphate (Vit B1) (Option B ruled out) Riboflavin (Vit B2 / FAD) Niacin (Vit B3 / NAD) Lipoic Acid (Option C ruled out) Pantothenic Acid / CoA / Vit B5 (Option D ruled out) It is involved in oxidative decarboxylation in the Krebs cycle but does not participate in oxidative phosphorylation.
