      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: B) Secondary active transport via SGLT1 transporter Explanation: Enterocytes primarily uptake glucose through the secondary active transport mechanism mediated by the Sodium-dependent glucose cotransporter 1 (SGLT1). This transporter utilizes the sodium gradient created by the Na+/K+ ATPase pump on the basolateral membrane of the enterocyte. Sodium ions move down their concentration gradient into the cell, and glucose is co-transported with them into the enterocyte against its concentration gradient. GLUT5 (Option A) is a transporter for fructose, not glucose. Facilitated diffusion via GLUT transporters does occur for glucose, but in enterocytes via GLUT2. The Na+/K+ ATPase pump (Option C) does not directly transport glucose. Glucose is a polar molecule and cannot diffuse (Option D) through the lipid bilayer of the cell membrane without assistance.

      "explanation": "a phenomenon known as the Warburg effect , where glucose is converted to lactate despite sufficient oxygen. Aerobic glycolysis produces 2 pyruvates and a net gain of 7 ATPs (5 ATP indirectly from 2 NADH and 2 ATP directly from glycolysis itself), while anaerobic glycolysis produces 2 lactates and only 2 ATPs .

Also, RBC exclusively uses anaerobic glycolysis as the primary source of energy due to the lack of mitochondria, thereby reducing pyruvate to lactate. Fast twitch muscle (white muscle fibers or Type II fibers) rely on anaerobic glycolysis for a rapid source of ATP during intense, short bursts of activity (Option D) .

        "D": "Renal medulla is most affected by ischemic damage to the kidney"
      },
      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "white muscle fibers (fast-twitch fibers). White muscle fibers are less reliant on myoglobin and tend to have fewer of these oxygen-storing molecules. Instead, white fibers rely more on anaerobic glycolysis for energy during muscle contractions. White muscle fibers lack myoglobin and contain few mitochondria. Therefore, they rely on anaerobic glycolysis and creatine phosphate for energy production, especially during muscle contraction when the blood flow to the muscle fiber is reduced. (Option B) Mature erythrocytes do not contain mitochondria. Without mitochondria, erythrocytes cannot utilize fatty acids or ketone bodies as metabolic fuel. Therefore, glycolysis is the only pathway available for erythrocytes to generate ATP . (Option A) The medullary region of the kidney is the most prone to ischemic damage due to high oxygen demand and reduced perfusion due to supply by end arteries. Hence, in case of ischemia, they rely on anaerobic glycolysis for ATP.

      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "hemoglobin Correct answer: B) To produce 2,3-bisphosphoglycerate, which regulates oxygen binding to hemoglobin Explanation: The Rapoport-Luebering Shunt forms 2,3-bisphosphoglycerate (2,3-BPG) through a series of enzymatic reactions involving 1,3-bisphosphoglycerate (1,3-BPG). Formation of 1,3-BPG: In glycolysis, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate is converted to 1,3-bisphosphoglycerate by the enzyme glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase. This reaction involves the addition of an inorganic phosphate and the reduction of NAD+ to NADH. Conversion to 2,3-BPG: In the Rapoport-Luebering Shunt, 1,3-BPG is converted to 2,3-BPG by the enzyme bisphosphoglycerate mutase. This reaction shifts the phosphate group from the first carbon to the second carbon of the glycerate molecule, forming 2,3-BPG. Conversion of 2,3-BPG to 3-phosphoglycerate: 2,3-BPG can be hydrolyzed to 3-phosphoglycerate by the enzyme 2,3-bisphosphoglycerate phosphatase. This reaction removes a phosphate group, resulting in the formation of 3-phosphoglycerate, which then re-enters the glycolytic pathway. The Rapoport-Luebering Shunt does not generate ATP; it bypasses an ATP-generating step in glycolysis (Option A) . The conversion of pyruvate to lactate is a function of lactate dehydrogenase and is not related to the Rapoport-Luebering Shunt (Option C) . The conversion of glucose to glucose-6-phosphate is catalyzed by hexokinase or glucokinase and occurs at the very beginning of glycolysis, unrelated to the Rapoport-Luebering Shunt (Option D) .

Glucagon: Inhibitor of glycolysis. Activates pathways that result in the phosphorylation and inhibition of PFK-2, leading to reduced levels of fructose-2,6-bisphosphate. Decreases glycolysis by reducing the activity of PFK-1 through lower levels of fructose-2,6-bisphosphate. Allosteric Regulation Fructose-2,6-bisphosphate: Activator of PFK-1.

Binds allosterically to PFK-1, indicating sufficient cellular energy, and decreases its activity. Inhibits glycolysis by reducing the activity of PFK-1. Citrate: (Option B) Inhibitor of PFK-1. Binds allosterically to PFK-1, indicating ample biosynthetic precursors and energy. Reduces glycolytic flux by decreasing the activity of PFK-1. AMP: Role: Activator of PFK-1. Binds to PFK-1, increasing its activity when cellular energy is low. Enhances glycolysis by promoting the activity of PFK-1. H+ (Protons): Inhibitor of PFK-1. High concentrations of H+ (low pH) inhibit PFK-1 to prevent excessive acidification of the cell. Decreases glycolytic flux to avoid further acidification. Acetyl-CoA (Option D): While Acetyl-CoA is not a direct regulator of PFK-1, it generally indicates a high-energy state and leads to a decrease in glycolysis through the activation of pyruvate carboxylase and the inhibition of pyruvate dehydrogenase.
