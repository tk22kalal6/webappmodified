      },
      "correct_answer": "D",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: D) 22% Explanation: Chargaff's rule , which states that in DNA, the amount of adenine (A) is equal to the amount of thymine (T), and the amount of guanine (G) is equal to the amount of cytosine (C). DNA consists of four deoxyribonucleotides: deoxyadenylate (A), deoxyguanylate (G), deoxycytidylate (C), and thymidylate (T). The two strands of DNA are complementary, meaning adenine pairs with thymine, and guanine pairs with cytosine. Since the total percentage of nucleotides should add up to 100%, and 28% + 28% is already accounted for by thymine and adenine, the remaining percentage for guanine and cytosine is 44%. Since guanine and cytosine are present in equal amounts, the percentage of cytosine would be half of the remaining percentage, which is 22%.

      "explanation": "Correct Answer D - Homologous Recombination Homologous recombination is a DNA repair mechanism that involves the use of an undamaged complementary DNA strand from a homologous sequence as a template to repair double-strand breaks or other significant damage. It ensures high-fidelity repair by accurately replacing damaged DNA segments. Homologous recombination specifically uses a separate homologous DNA sequence for repair, unlike the other mechanisms that rely on the same DNA molecule. Base Excision Repair (Option A): Removes and replaces damaged bases by excising a single base and filling the gap using the original strand as a template. Nucleotide Excision Repair (Option B): Removes bulky lesions (e.g., thymine dimers) by excising a short DNA segment and filling the gap using the original strand as a template. Mismatch Repair (Option C): Fixes base mismatches that occur during replication using the parental strand as a template, not homologous DNA. Reference: Homologous recombination",

It relies on recognizing the newly synthesized strand, not methylation. DNA methylation involves adding a methyl group to cytosine residue in DNA. Types of DNA methylation: CpG methylation and Non-CpG methylation Enzymes involved: DNA methyltransferases Functions: Chromatin remodeling: DNA methylation affects chromatin structure by recruiting proteins (e.g., methyl-CpG-binding domain proteins) that compact chromatin, influencing gene expression. DNA replication: DNA methylation patterns are maintained during replication by DNA methyltransferases, ensuring epigenetic inheritance.

      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: B) RNA Splicing Explanation: RNA Splicing: This is not directly regulated by DNA methylation. RNA splicing is carried out by the spliceosome , a ribonucleoprotein complex that recognises specific RNA sequences. Although histone modifications and transcriptional elongation rates may influence alternative splicing, DNA methylation does not play a direct role in this process. Chromatin remodelling (Option A): DNA methylation contributes to chromatin remodelling by recruiting methyl-CpG-binding proteins (e.g., MeCP2), which interact with histone deacetylases (HDACs) and other chromatin-modifying complexes to create a compact, transcriptionally inactive chromatin structure. Gene silencing (Option C): Methylation of CpG islands in gene promoters blocks transcription factor binding, leading to long-term gene repression. It is a primary mechanism of epigenetic gene silencing . DNA replication (Option D): DNA methylation patterns are preserved during DNA replication by maintenance methyltransferase (DNMT1) , which ensures that methylation is faithfully copied to daughter strands.

Hereditary Nonpolyposis Colon Cancer (HNPCC), also known as Lynch syndrome: Characterized by microsatellite instability. The most common gene mutation associated with Lynch syndrome is in the human MutS homolog 2 (hMSH2) gene. Defects in mismatch repair genes, particularly hMSH1 and hMSH2, lead to ineffective repair of DNA replication errors. These gene defects are located on chromosome 2. The inability to correct mismatches during DNA replication increases the risk of mutations, contributing to the development of colon cancer. Incorrect Options: Nucleotide excision repair (Option B) associated with xeroderma pigmentosum (XP),Cockayne syndrome (CS) and Trichothiodystrophy (TTD). Base excision repair (Option C) associated with genetic disorders like some forms of inherited breast and ovarian cancer, Alzheimers and Parkinson disease. Point mutation (Option D) While they can contribute to cancer, hereditary non-polyposis colon carcinoma is related to mismatch repair pathway dysfunction, not general point mutations.

The mutant tRNA can recognize the mutant codon and insert the correct amino acid, thus restoring the wild-type phenotype despite the presence of the original mutation in the coding gene. This type of mutation effectively suppresses the impact of the original mutation. Incorrect Options: Option A - Frameshift of the mutated gene : A frameshift mutation involves inserting or deleting a number of nucleotides that are not divisible by three. This shifts the reading frame of the codons in the mRNA, often resulting in a completely nonfunctional protein. This type of mutation usually cannot be easily reversed by a single mutation and thus is unlikely to lead to a reversion to the wild-type phenotype. Option B - Addition of another normal gene: This would introduce a normal copy of the gene into the genome, which could potentially compensate for the mutant gene. This process is often referred to as gene therapy. While this can restore the wild-type phenotype, it is not a mutation but rather an addition of genetic material. Therefore, it does not fit the question's criteria of a mutation leading to reversion. Option C - Deletion of the mutated gene: Deleting a mutant gene would remove its effects but would not necessarily result in a wild-type phenotype unless there is a compensatory mechanism in place. Deletion does not count as a mutation that causes reversion to the wild-type phenotype. Reference: .",

      "explanation": "Correct Answer: A) Somatic hypermutation Explanation: Affinity maturation of antibodies is the process by which B cells produce antibodies with increasingly higher affinity for their specific antigen during an immune response. This is primarily driven by somatic hypermutation (SHM). Somatic Hypermutation: Occurs in the germinal centers of lymphoid tissues. The enzyme Activation-Induced Cytidine Deaminase (AID) introduces random point mutations in the variable (V) regions of immunoglobulin genes, particularly in the complementarity-determining regions (CDRs) , which determine antigen binding. Selection for High Affinity: B cells with mutated antibodies are tested for their ability to bind the antigen presented on follicular dendritic cells. High-affinity B cells receive survival signals and proliferate. Low-affinity or non-functional B cells undergo apoptosis. Over successive rounds of SHM and selection, the antibody pool shifts towards higher affinity for the antigen, enhancing the effectiveness of the immune response.

      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: B) Folate Explanation: Misincorporation of uracil into DNA is seen in folate deficiency due to impaired thymidine synthesis . Role of Folate in DNA Synthesis: Folate (in its active form, tetrahydrofolate) is crucial for the synthesis of thymidine, one of the four nucleotide bases in DNA. Folate acts as a methyl donor in the conversion of dUMP (deoxyuridine monophosphate) to dTMP (deoxythymidine monophosphate), which is required for DNA synthesis. Effect of Folate Deficiency: In the absence of adequate folate, the conversion of dUMP to dTMP is impaired. dUMP is a precursor to thymidine, but without sufficient folate, it accumulates and can be misincorporated into DNA instead of dTMP (which contains thymine). Uracil (which normally appears in RNA) can then be incorporated into DNA, because uracil can pair with adenine, unlike thymine (which normally pairs with adenine). Massive incorporation of uracil into DNA(4million per cell). Consequences of Uracil Misincorporation: This uracil misincorporation leads to DNA instability. The presence of uracil in the DNA can result in mutations or the activation of repair mechanisms, which may cause strand breaks or chromosomal abnormalities.

Autosomal recessive SCID is commonly caused by a deficiency in adenosine deaminase (ADA), accounting for about 15-20% of SCID cases. Adenosine Deaminase (ADA) Function: ADA is an enzyme in the purine salvage pathway. Converts adenosine and deoxyadenosine into inosine and deoxyinosine. Important for maintaining the balance of nucleotide pools in cells. Pathophysiology of ADA Deficiency : Deficiency of ADA → Accumulation of deoxyadenosine and dATP. Deoxyadenosine toxicity Directly toxic to developing T-cells and B-cells. Inhibits ribonucleotide reductase, blocking DNA synthesis and cell division. Lymphocyte apoptosis: Lymphocyte precursors (especially T-cells) undergo apoptosis due to DNA damage and lack of nucleotide availability. Clinical Features of ADA-SCID: Onset : Neonatal period (within the first few months of life). Severe recurrent infections: Fungal, bacterial, and viral infections. Persistent diarrhea. Failure to thrive. Chronic candidiasis. Absent lymphoid tissue: No tonsils or palpable lymph nodes. Severe lymphopenia: Low T-cells, B-cells, and NK cells (T I B I NK I phenotype). Diagnosis: Lymphopenia on CBC. Flow cytometry: Absent T-cells, B-cells, and NK cells. Low ADA activity in leukocytes. Genetic testing: Mutation in the ADA gene.
