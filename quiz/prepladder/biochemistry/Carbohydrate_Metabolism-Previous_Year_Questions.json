      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "Correct answer: A) Calcium Explanation: Glycogen phosphorylase is activated by calcium in tissues, particularly in muscle cells. Calcium and Muscle Contraction: During muscle contraction, calcium ions are released from the sarcoplasmic reticulum in response to a neural signal. Calcium then binds to calmodulin, a calcium-binding protein, forming the calcium-calmodulin complex. Activation of Phosphorylase Kinase: The calcium-calmodulin complex activates phosphorylase kinase, an enzyme that plays a key role in glycogen breakdown. Activation of Glycogen Phosphorylase: The phosphorylation of glycogen phosphorylase activates it, which in turn stimulates the breakdown of glycogen into glucose-1-phosphate, providing energy for muscle contraction. Cofactor of glycogen phosphorylase is pyridoxal phosphate (PLP) Reference: pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11341967/#:~:text=The%20presence%20of%20Mem-CC,-CC%20(0.3%20nM).",

      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: A) Glycolysis Explanation: Glucagon is a hormone produced by the alpha cells of the pancreas that primarily increases blood glucose levels, especially during fasting or low glucose states. It achieves this by stimulating processes that increase glucose availability and energy production. Glycolysis is the metabolic pathway that breaks down glucose to produce energy (ATP). Glucagon inhibits glycolysis in the liver to conserve glucose and promote the release of glucose into the bloodstream. Instead of promoting glucose breakdown, glucagon promotes glucose production and release. Gluconeogenesis (Option B): Stimulates the production of glucose from non-carbohydrate sources (amino acids, lactate) in the liver. Glycogenolysis (Option C): Stimulates the breakdown of glycogen into glucose in the liver to release glucose into the bloodstream. Ketogenesis (Option D): Stimulates the production of ketone bodies in the liver from fatty acids during periods of prolonged fasting or carbohydrate restriction. Reference: Glucagon",

      },
      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: C) Galactose-1-phosphate uridyl transferase. Explanation: Classical galactosemia is a genetic metabolic disorder caused by a deficiency of the enzyme galactose-1-phosphate uridyl transferase (GALT). This enzyme is essential for the proper metabolism of galactose, a sugar found in milk and other dairy products. Role of GALT in Galactose Metabolism: GALT converts galactose-1-phosphate to UDP-galactose, which is required for various biochemical processes, including the synthesis of glycoproteins and glycolipids. A deficiency in GALT leads to the accumulation of galactose-1-phosphate and galactose in tissues, which can cause toxicity and damage to the liver, kidneys, and brain, leading to the symptoms of classical galactosemia. Clinical Features of Classical Galactosemia: Failure to thrive and jaundice in the neonatal period after feeding with milk. Liver damage, cataracts, intellectual disability, and sepsis from E. coli infections (due to impaired immune function). Diagnosis: Elevated galactose-1-phosphate in red blood cells. Genetic testing for mutations in the GALT gene. Treatment: Lactose-free diet (avoiding galactose) to prevent the accumulation of galactose and its metabolites. Aldose reductase (Option A): Involved in the reduction of galactose to galactitol, which is implicated in galactose toxicity but is not the enzyme deficient in classical galactosemia. Galactokinase (Option B): Deficiency causes galactokinase deficiency or non-classical galactosemia, which leads to cataract formation but does not cause the systemic effects seen in classical galactosemia (liver damage, intellectual disability). UDP-galactose-4-epimerase (Option D): Deficiency causes epimerase-deficient galactosemia, a less common form of galactosemia with milder symptoms than classical galactosemia.

      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "the conversion of pyruvate to acetyl-CoA through the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex (PDC). When deficient, the activity of the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex is impaired. As a result, there is a buildup of pyruvate. This pyruvate is then diverted to other metabolic pathways, like the conversion to lactic acid (lactate), resulting in lactic acidosis. Thiamine deficiency : The Aleurone layer of cereals (food grains) is a rich source of thiamine. Therefore, whole wheat flour and unpolished hand-pound rice have better nutritive value than completely polished refined foods. When the grains are polished, the aleurone layer is usually removed. Biochemical parameters: Thiamine deficiency affects the enzyme transketolase, which is involved in the pentose phosphate pathway. Measuring transketolase activity in red blood cells is a specific test for thiamine deficiency and can confirm the diagnosis. Erythrocyte transketolase activity is reduced; this is the earliest manifestation seen even before clinical disturbances. Conditions Biochemical Role of Thiamine Deficiency Manifestations Dry Beriberi Essential for carbohydrate metabolism and nerve function Peripheral neuritis, sensory disturbances, difficulty walking, and paralysis due to CNS manifestations. Wet Beriberi Thiamine is necessary for the PDH complex and low activity causes Lactic acidosis. Lactic acidosis causes vasodilatation and hence cardiovascular manifestations. Cardiovascular manifestations such as oedema, palpitations, breathlessness, and heart failure. Maple Syrup Urine Disease Cofactor for decarboxylation of branched-chain keto acids Accumulation of branched-chain keto acids leads to convulsions, severe mental retardation, vomiting, acidosis, coma, and death. Lactic Acidosis Cofactor for pyruvate dehydrogenase, converting pyruvate to acetyl-CoA Impaired conversion leads to increased lactate and pyruvate levels, causing lactic acidosis. Pyruvate carboxylase (Option A) is not directly involved in the conversion of pyruvate to acetyl-CoA. Pyruvate carboxylase is responsible for the conversion of pyruvate to oxaloacetate in an anaplerotic reaction that replenishes TCA cycle intermediates. It is not directly affected by thiamine deficiency in the context of lactic acidosis. Phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (Option C) is responsible for the conversion of oxaloacetate to phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP), an important step in gluconeogenesis. It is not directly involved in the conversion of pyruvate to acetyl-CoA and is not typically affected by thiamine deficiency. Transketolase (Option D) is involved in the non-oxidative phase of the pentose phosphate pathway (PPP), which generates ribose-5-phosphate and other sugars. Transketolase requires thiamine pyrophosphate as a cofactor.",

Prolonged fasting (after 24 hours): Gluconeogenesis becomes the primary glucose source, with glucagon playing a key role. Later starvation (after 3-5 days): Ketogenesis increases as an alternative fuel. Hormonal Changes in Starvation Hormone Effect in Starvation Glucagon Increases to stimulate gluconeogenesis and glycogenolysis. Insulin Decreases to reduce glucose uptake by tissues. Cortisol Increases to promote protein catabolism for gluconeogenesis. Epinephrine Increases to enhance glycogen breakdown and lipolysis.

      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: B) Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase Explanation Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase is the rate-limiting step of the HMP pathway. It catalyzes the oxidation of glucose-6-phosphate to 6-phosphoglucono- δ -lactone, generating NADPH, which is critical for reductive biosynthesis and maintaining cellular redox balance. The pentose phosphate pathway (PPP) is essential in erythrocytes because it generates NADPH. NADPH is crucial for maintaining glutathione in its reduced form, which is necessary for the activity of glutathione peroxidase. This enzyme removes harmful hydrogen peroxide (H I O I ), protecting red blood cells from oxidative damage and preventing hemolysis. Pentose Phosphate Pathway (PPP) The Pentose Phosphate Pathway (PPP), also known as the hexose monophosphate shunt, is an alternative metabolic pathway for glucose that doesn't generate ATP. Location: Cytosol It serves two primary functions: NADPH Production The PPP is a major source of NADPH, vital for biosynthesis (fatty acids and steroids). NADPH Production: RBCs rely on glycolysis for ATP due to the lack of mitochondria and depend solely on the PPP for NADPH, as they lack mitochondrial dehydrogenases. Glutathione Maintenance: NADPH keeps glutathione reduced, enabling glutathione peroxidase to neutralize hydrogen peroxide and prevent oxidative damage. Impact of NADPH Deficiency : Low NADPH reduces glutathione, impairs glutathione peroxidase, increases oxidative damage , and leads to hemolysis . Ribose-5-Phosphate (R-5-P) Synthesis Ribose-5-phosphate is essential for nucleotide synthesis needed for RNA and DNA. Homeostasis between NADPH and R-5-P production. When NADPH demand exceeds R-5-P's need, the non-oxidative phase converts R-5-P to glycolytic intermediates (fructose-6-phosphate and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate). If the demand for R-5-P is higher than for NADPH, the non-oxidative phase generates R-5-P from fructose-6-phosphate and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate, bypassing the oxidative steps. Differences from Glycolysis Uses NADP+ instead of NAD+ and generates CO2, not ATP. Glucose-6-phosphatase (Option A): This enzyme catalyzes the conversion of glucose-6-phosphate to glucose during gluconeogenesis and glycogenolysis. It is not involved in the HMP pathway. Phosphofructokinase-1 (Option C): This enzyme is the rate-limiting enzyme of glycolysis , not the HMP pathway. Glycogen phosphorylase (Option D): This enzyme catalyzes the breakdown of glycogen to glucose-1-phosphate in glycogenolysis and is not related to the HMP pathway.",

      "question": "A patient with a history of strenuous exercise forgot to eat a meal and later consumed alcohol at a party. Which of the following metabolic processes is inhibited by alcohol consumption?",
      "options": {
        "A": "Gluconeogenesis",
        "B": "Glycogenolysis",
        "C": "HMP shunt",
        "D": "Ketone body formation"
      },
      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: A) Gluconeogenesis Explanation Alcohol consumption inhibits gluconeogenesis. Alcohol metabolism increases the NADH/NAD+ ratio in the liver, which inhibits key enzymes involved in gluconeogenesis, leading to hypoglycemia, especially in a fasting state after strenuous exercise. Alcohol produces a high NADH/NAD+ ratio in the cytoplasm, the high NADH level favours the conversion of pyruvate to lactate, leading to lactic acidosis. Deficiency of pyruvate leads to inadequate formation of oxaloacetate which blocks gluconeogenesis This results in low blood sugar levels. Symptoms of alcohol-induced hypoglycemia include confusion, irritability, and, in severe cases, loss of consciousness. Glycogenolysis (Option B): Glycogenolysis is generally stimulated by alcohol consumption due to the liver's attempt to maintain glucose levels. While alcohol inhibits gluconeogenesis, it does not directly inhibit glycogenolysis. HMP shunt (Option C): The hexose monophosphate (HMP) shunt is primarily involved in the production of NADPH and ribose-5-phosphate. Alcohol does not directly inhibit this pathway. Ketone body formation (Option D): Ketone body formation can actually be promoted in alcohol consumption as the body shifts to using fatty acids for energy when glucose is unavailable.

        "D": "Wilson's disease"
      },
      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "of oil drop cataract in a newborn infant with jaundice and lens opacities is Galactosemia. Oil drop cataract is a type of cataract characterized by small, white, punctate opacities that resemble oil drops in the lens of the eye. This specific type of cataract is associated with galactosemia, which is an inherited metabolic disorder that affects the body's ability to metabolize galactose, a sugar found in milk and other dairy products. In galactosemia, there is a deficiency in one of the enzymes involved in the metabolism of galactose, leading to the accumulation of galactose-1-phosphate in various tissues, including the lens of the eye. The accumulation of galactose-1-phosphate can result in the formation of the characteristic oil drop opacities seen in the lens. Incorrect Options: Option A - Phenylketonuria (PKU) : Phenylketonuria is a metabolic disorder caused by a deficiency of the enzyme phenylalanine hydroxylase. This leads to the buildup of phenylalanine in the body. However, PKU is not associated with oil drop cataract; instead, it can lead to intellectual disability, developmental delays, and other neurological problems if left untreated. Option B - Maple syrup urine disease: This is a metabolic disorder that affects the breakdown of branched-chain amino acids (leucine, isoleucine, and valine). It can cause neurological symptoms and a characteristic sweet odor to the urine. It is not associated with oil drop cataract. Option D - Wilson's disease: Wilson's disease is a disorder of copper metabolism, leading to copper accumulation primarily in the liver and brain. It can cause various neurological and hepatic symptoms. It is not associated with oil drop cataract.",

This enzyme is essential for glycogen breakdown in muscle cells. Patients with McArdle's disease typically present with exercise intolerance, muscle cramps, and myoglobinuria after strenuous activity. Hers' Disease or Glycogen Storage Disease Type VI (Option B): It results from a deficiency in liver phosphorylase. While it does cause hepatomegaly and mild hypoglycemia, the symptoms are generally milder.

      },
      "correct_answer": "D",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: D) Activation of hormone-sensitive lipase Explanation: Hormone-sensitive lipase (HSL) is activated in response to low insulin:glucagon ratio. HSL breaks down stored triglycerides in adipose tissue into free fatty acids and glycerol, providing energy during fasting. Insulin:Glucagon Bipolar Axis : Insulin : Anabolic hormone promoting glycogenesis, lipogenesis, and protein synthesis. Glucagon : Catabolic hormone stimulating glycogenolysis, gluconeogenesis, and lipolysis. IGR : High IGR → Anabolic state, reduced glucose production. Low IGR → Catabolic state, increased glucose production. Determinants of IGR : Influenced by insulin and glucagon secretion patterns, dietary composition, and metabolic status. Variability in systemic and portal concentrations complicates measurement accuracy. Activation of lipoprotein lipase (Option A): Lipoprotein lipase is activated by insulin, not glucagon. It facilitates triglyceride uptake from circulating lipoproteins into adipose tissue for storage, which occurs in the fed state. Activation of glycogen synthase (Option B): Glycogen synthase is activated by insulin, promoting glycogen synthesis in the liver and muscle during the fed state. Activation of phosphofructokinase (Option C): Phosphofructokinase (PFK) is a key enzyme in glycolysis. It is activated by insulin and suppressed during fasting (low insulin:glucagon ratio), as glycolysis is reduced in favor of gluconeogenesis.
