      "question": "In a case presented in the outpatient department (OPD), a patient reported experiencing abdominal pain and diarrhea. Upon further examination, the patient exhibited symptoms of cutaneous flushing, extensive wheezing, and tricuspid insufficiency. Subsequent contrast enhanced MRI scans indicated the presence of endocardial fibrosis. As a result of this condition, which substance is likely to be excreted excessively by the patient?",
      "options": {
        "A": "Vanillylmandelic acid",
        "B": "Imidazoleacetic acid",
        "C": "5-hydroxy indole acetic acid",
        "D": "Choline"
      },
      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "diarrhea, bronchospasm as well as carcinoid heart disease. Expression of its amine or hormones is variable, so it makes diagnosis of disease late or erroneous. 5-Hydroxy indoleacetic acid (5-HIAA) is considered as important biomarkers for the disease, while Chromogranin A(CgA), pancreatic polypeptide are also used as non-specific biomarkers for the disease. Primary metabolic substrate of serotonin is 5-Hydroxy indoleacetic acid (5-HIAA). Serotonin gets broken into 5-hydroxy indoleacetic acid (5-HIAA) within the liver. Incorrect Choices: a. Neuroblastoma are diagnosed by the presence of urinary vanillylmandelic acid and homo vanillic acid (HVA) as biomarkers. b. Breast tumors are caused by imidazole-acetic acid and its derivatives. d. Dietary intake of choline in excess can cause risk of colon and rectum cancer. Reference: .",

      "options": {
        "A": "Droplet digital PCR",
        "B": "FISH",
        "C": "Nested PCR",

      },
      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: A - Droplet digital PCR Explanation: Droplet Digital PCR (ddPCR) is a highly sensitive quantitative technique for detecting mutations with very low allele frequencies. It partitions a sample into thousands of droplets, each containing a single DNA molecule. PCR is performed on each droplet, and fluorescent probes detect the presence or absence of the mutation. Specialized equipment analyzes the droplets to count fluorescent signals, determining mutation frequency. ddPCR is highly accurate and valuable for detecting low-frequency mutations in clinical samples. Learning Objective: Assay Type Advantages Main Limitations Real-time PCR Rapid results Cost effectiveness Limited number of DNA sequences Digital droplet PCR High sensitivity (detection of low allele frequency,0.005-0.1) Limited number of DNA sequences Next-generation sequencing Larger number of DNA sequences. Detection of coexisting mutations. Higher allele frequency required compared to ddPCR (0.1%). Higher costs More complex data analysis and interpretation.
