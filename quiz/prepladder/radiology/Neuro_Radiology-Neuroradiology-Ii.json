Huntington's Disease Definition Hereditary neurodegenerative disorder characterized by chorea, psychiatric symptoms, and cognitive decline. Inheritance Pattern Autosomal dominant due to a mutation in the HTT gene on chromosome 4 involving a CAG trinucleotide repeat. Clinical Features Chorea: Involuntary, irregular movements. Mood Changes: Irritability and aggressive behavior. Cognitive Decline: Progressive memory loss (dementia). Radiological Findings Atrophy of Caudate Nucleus: Leads to dilation of the frontal horn of the lateral ventricle. \"Boxcar Ventricles\" Appearance: Resulting from caudate atrophy. Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease (CJD) (Option A) Definition A rapidly progressive neurodegenerative disorder caused by prions—misfolded proteins that induce other proteins to misfold, leading to brain damage.

Sturge–Weber Syndrome (SWS) It is a congenital syndrome characterized by a facial port-wine stain (nevus) and ipsilateral leptomeningeal angiomas, typically located in the parieto-occipital region. Clinically present with: Focal seizures often begin in the first year of life and may become refractory later Developmental delay Progressive hemiparesis Hemianopsia Intellectual impairment Glaucoma (Unilateral) Imaging findings: Early Imaging: CT and MRI may appear normal initially as pial angiomas may not be noticeable before age 2 . (vs Option A) By age 2 , \" tramline calcifications \" may be visible on skull radiographs due to chronic ischemia. The affected hemisphere shows atrophy and progressive cortical calcification. A pial angioma is seen as diffuse pial enhancement, with possible variable thickness on imaging. Other Findings: enlargement of the ipsilateral choroid plexus and dilation of veins connecting superficial and deep venous systems. Late imaging: Burnt Out Cases: in chronic cases, the pial angioma may no longer be detectable, leaving a shrunken, calcified hemisphere. Polymicrogyria may be observed in some children with SWS.

On T2-weighted images, dilated feeding and draining vessels appear as flow-voids . The primary treatment involves endovascular procedures. Arteriovenous (AV) malformation (Option C) AVM is an abnormal tangle of vessels connecting an artery to a vein without a normal capillary bed. Clinically present as Acute hemorrhage . AVMs consist of several components: Feeding arteries – supply blood to the malformation Nidus (meaning \"nest\") – the central part where abnormal connections occur Shunting arterioles – the main issue, causing direct blood flow from arteries to veins Interconnected venous loops Draining veins – carry blood away from the malformation Early appearance of draining veins during the arterial phase of cerebral angiography indicates the presence of an arteriovenous shunt. CECT shows a \"bag of worms\" appearance. Fast blood flow creates flow voids visible on T2-weighted images. Developmental venous anomaly (Option D) Congenital malformation of veins that drain the normal brain.

      "explanation": "mammillary bodies, periventricular grey matter, and the thalamus. These areas are particularly vulnerable to thiamine deficiency, often seen in alcoholics. Other areas like the corpus callosum and hippocampus can be affected in other conditions but are not primary locations for damage. Chronic Alcoholism Chronic alcoholism can lead to several severe neurological conditions, many of which are due to vitamin deficiencies or electrolyte imbalances that result from prolonged alcohol abuse. Three major conditions associated with chronic alcoholism are Wernicke’s encephalopathy, Marchiafava-Bignami Disease (MBD), and Central Pontine Myelinolysis (CPM) / Osmotic Demyelination Syndrome (ODS). Wernicke's Encephalopathy Pathophysiology Thiamine (Vitamin B1) deficiency caused by chronic alcoholism, leading to impaired glucose metabolism and brain dysfunction, particularly in memory and coordination areas. Clinical Features Mnemonic: GOA G lobal Confusion: Mental disorientation, concentration issues, memory loss. O phthalmoplegia: Paralysis or weakness of eye muscles, nystagmus, or double vision. A taxia: Gait and stance disturbances due to cerebellar dysfunction. Progression Can lead to Wernicke-Korsakoff Syndrome, characterized by irreversible memory deficits and confabulation. Diagnostic Test Red Blood Cell Transketolase Test: Assesses thiamine deficiency. MRI Findings Signaling abnormalities seen in Mammillary Bodies: Atrophy or hyperintensity. Periventricular Gray Matter Thalamus. Midbrain Colliculi. Fornix involvement. Treatment Immediate Thiamine Supplementation: Administer thiamine (typically 100 mg IV or IM). Glucose Infusion: After thiamine is given, a glucose-containing solution can be infused, Marchiafava-Bignami Disease (MBD) Pathophysiology Rare condition affecting chronic alcoholics, causing demyelination and necrosis of the corpus callosum. The mechanism is not fully understood, but it's linked to malnutrition and chronic alcohol toxicity. Clinical Features Cognitive Disturbances: Progressive dementia, confusion, memory loss. Motor Symptoms: Seizures, gait abnormalities, spasticity. Altered Sensorium: Lethargy, stupor, or coma. Progression Can lead to severe cognitive impairment, spasticity, coma, or death. The condition may worsen rapidly or fluctuate over time. MRI Findings Hyperintense lesions on T2-weighted and FLAIR sequences in the corpus callosum, especially the body and splenium. Signs: 1. \"Butterfly-shaped\" lesions in the corpus callosum 2. Sandwich sign Treatment Thiamine and vitamin B-complex supplementation is usually administered. Osmotic Demyelination Syndrome (ODS) / Central Pontine Myelinolysis (CPM): Pathophysiology Occurs due to rapid correction of chronic hyponatremia, leading to osmotic shifts and destruction of the myelin",

      "explanation": "assertion. particularly the loss of dopamine-producing neurons in the substantia nigra. This loss leads to specific morphological changes in the putamen and other structures, supporting the assertion that its absence is indicative of Parkinson's disease. Parkinson's Disease (PD) Parkinson's Disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative disorder marked by motor symptoms like bradykinesia, rigidity, and tremors, primarily due to dopaminergic neuron loss in the substantia nigra pars compacta of the midbrain. Diagnosis typically involves clinical evaluation, though neuroimaging can offer insights into disease pathophysiology and assist in distinguishing PD from \"Parkinson plus\" syndromes. Normal and Abnormal Radiological Findings Normal Midbrain: Split/Swallow Tail Sign (Figure 1A): In healthy individuals, MRI imaging of the midbrain reveals a characteristic \"swallow tail\" sign due to the presence of nigrosomes (distinctive structures within the substantia nigra). This sign is indicative of normal dopaminergic function. Parkinson's Disease (Figure 1B): Absence of Swallow Tail Sign: In patients with PD, the swallow tail sign is absent. This finding suggests a loss of nigrosomes due to the degeneration of dopaminergic neurons. Loss of Nigrosomes: MRI findings will demonstrate the absence of nigrosomes in the substantia nigra, correlating with the loss of dopamine production. Parkinson Plus Syndromes \"Parkinson plus\" syndromes are atypical parkinsonian disorders that share core features with Parkinson’s Disease, such as bradykinesia and rigidity, but with distinct additional symptoms: Dementia: Early cognitive decline. Autonomic Dysfunction: Symptoms like orthostatic hypotension, urinary incontinence, and sexual dysfunction. Common examples of Parkinson plus syndromes include: Progressive Supranuclear Palsy (PSP) (also known as Steele-Richardson-Olszewski Syndrome) Multiple System Atrophy (MSA) Corticobasal Degeneration (CBD) Radiological Considerations for Other Parkinson Plus Syndromes Progressive Supranuclear Palsy (PSP) / Steele-Richardson-Olszewski Syndrome It typically presents with early postural instability and difficulty with eye movements, especially vertical gaze palsy. PSP is associated with midbrain atrophy, which is easily identified on MRI. Mickey Mouse Sign: One key radiological sign seen in PSP is the \"Mickey Mouse sign\" on axial MRI imaging of the midbrain. This occurs due to atrophy of the midbrain, giving it the shape of Mickey Mouse's head. Hummingbird Sign: Seen on sagittal MRI views of the midbrain. This appearance is due to atrophy of the midbrain, which gives it the shape of a bird in flight, with the preserved pons forming the body and the atrophic midbrain forming the head. Multiple System Atrophy (MSA): MRI may show atrophy of the putamen and cerebellar structures. The presence of the \"hot cross bun\" sign in the pons is characteristic of MSA, especially when there is cerebellar involvement (MSA-C). Corticobasal Degeneration (CBD): MRI findings in CBD may show asymmetrical cortical atrophy and basal ganglia changes.",
