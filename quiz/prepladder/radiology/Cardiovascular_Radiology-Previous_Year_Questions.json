      "question": "A 12-week-old child presented with fever, cyanosis, and fatigue. His chest X-ray is shown below. What is the most likely diagnosis?",
      "options": {
        "A": "Total anomalous pulmonary venous circulation",
        "B": "Tetralogy of Fallot",
        "C": "Transposition of great arteries",
        "D": "Pericardial effusion"
      },
      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: A) Total anomalous pulmonary venous circulation Explanation: The X-ray reveals a \"figure-of-eight\" or \"snowman\" appearance, which is characteristic of supracardiac TAPVC. Total Anomalous Pulmonary Venous Connection (TAPVC) Pathology Pulmonary veins drain into the right atrium directly or indirectly via an abnormal venous connection Not a ductal-dependent cyanotic lesion Sites of venous connection Supracardiac- superior vena cava (Most common) Cardiac-coronary sinus, right atrium Infracardiac Mixed Clinical presentation Cyanosis and congestive cardiac failure With ASD- wide and split S2 Chest X-ray Snowman or figure-8 configuration in supracardiac TAPVC Treatment Surgery No indication for prostaglandins (Not a ductal-dependent cyanotic lesion) Tetralogy of Fallot (Option B): Associated with \"boot-shaped heart\" on X-ray. Transposition of Great Arteries (TGA) (Option C): Associated with \"egg on a string\" appearance on X-ray. Pericardial Effusion (Option D): Would present with an enlarged, globular heart (\"water bottle\" appearance) on X-ray.",

      "question": "Comment on the diagnosis of the CT chest shown below.",
      "options": {
        "A": "Aortic dissection",
        "B": "Pulmonary embolism",
        "C": "Cardiac myxoma",
        "D": "Aortic aneurysm"
      },
      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer A- Aortic dissection Explanation: The given CT shows an intimal tear in the aorta indicating an Aortic dissection. Aortic Dissection It occurs when a defect or a flap occurs in the aorta, resulting in blood tracking into aortic tissues, splitting the medial layer and creating a false lumen. Clinical features: Sudden onset of severe, tearing chest, radiating to the interscapular region Renal pain and renal failure Paraplegia Syncope Weakness Hypotension or shock Investigations: If the patient is stable, CT angiography is the standard investigation of choice. In the case of unstable patients (SBP<100 mm of HG, HR>100 bpm), the preferred investigation of choice will be TEE (TransEsophageal Echocardiography) MRI can also be done if CT is unequivocal. Chest x-ray reveals widening of mediastinum along with left-sided pleural effusion. Signs of FALSE LUMEN: Cobweb Sign: Irregularities of False lumen Beak Sign: False lumen forms acute angle with True lumen: Pulmonary embolism (Option B): Filling Defect seen in Pulmonary artery IOC for PE: CT Angiography Incorrect Options: Cardiac Myxoma (Option C): Low annotating hypodense lesion on the posterior most chamber of the heart (Left Atrium) MC primary Benign cardiac tumor in adults. Aortic aneurysm (Option D): Involve either ascending aorta, thoracic aorta & abdominal aorta Represents localized dilation of the aorta; while an aneurysm may predispose to dissection, an intimal tear specifically indicates dissection. M/C cause for abdominal & thoracic aortic aneurysm: Atherosclerosis",

      "question": "A 55 year old male patient presented with complaints of dyspnea with congestive heart failure. The clinician wants to know whether it's HF with preserved EF or reduced EF. Which of the below investigation is used for calculation of ejection fraction?",
      "options": {
        "A": "MUGA",
        "B": "SPECT using thallium",
        "C": "PET myocardial perfusion imaging",
        "D": "Sestamibi scan with pharmacological stress"
      },
      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer A- MUGA Explanation: Ejection fraction (EF) is a critical parameter for differentiating heart failure with preserved EF (HFpEF) from heart failure with reduced EF (HFrEF). MUGA scan is a non-invasive nuclear imaging test that accurately calculates EF by analyzing the motion of the heart's ventricles using a radioactive tracer and a gamma camera. Purpose Scan types For Myocardial Perfusion Assess ischemia Cold spot: decreased uptake in ischemic areas. Thallium scan (Commonly used) (Option B) Tetrofosmin Sestamibi scan (Option D) For Myocardial Infarction Assess infarct Hot spot in infarct area as pyrophosphate accumulates and is not metabolized. 99m Tc - Pyrophosphate scan. For Ventricular Function Evaluate ejection fraction MUGA (Multiple Gated Acquisition) scan (AKA nuclear ventriculography) Radiolabeled RBCs are used Most accurate for ventricular function - Cardiac MRI For Myocardial Viability Assess the viability of myocardium PETscan - Best investigation for myocardial viability. (Option C) Perfusion and metabolism mismatch are observed in the PET scan. Perfusion Agents :N-13 ammonia and Rubidium chloride. Metabolism Agent : FDG-PET is used for glucose metabolism. No FDG uptake indicates a normal heart or an infarct. FDG uptake is present: In the Ischemic Myocardium FDG-PET is combined with perfusion imaging for comprehensive assessment. Uptake in PET with low perfusion indicates reversible dysfunction (suggestive of hibernation ). Irreversible dysfunction indicates the presence of scar tissue . Note: Hibernating myocardium is ischemic but viable.",
