Features: Lateral displacement of the lateral masses of C1 relative to C2. Fracture lines in the anterior and posterior arches of C1. Potential instability if there is transverse ligament rupture. Unstable fractures: Posterior fixation with pedicle screw system Chance fracture (Option A) is a seatbelt injury that results from a flexion-distraction mechanism . It involves disruption of the posterior column structures and is frequently associated with intra-abdominal injuries. Radiographic findings show a horizontal fracture through the posterior elements or disruption of the facet joints and spinous processes. Hangman's fracture (Option B) refers to a bilateral fracture of the pedicles of the C2 vertebra caused by hyperextension and axial loading of the cervical spine.

Cobb Angle: It is measured by the intersection of perpendicular lines drawn to the end plates of the most tilted vertebrae in a spinal curve . A Cobb angle greater than 10° in the coronal plane indicates scoliosis. Codman Angle (Option A) is formed by the intersection of a line along the bone cortex and another line at the point where the periosteum is elevated.

      "correct_answer": "D",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: D) CT scan of the femur Explanation: The clinical presentation and radiographic findings suggest Osteoid osteoma , characterized by nocturnal pain that is relieved by NSAIDs. This benign bone tumor commonly affects young adults and is often located in the cortex of long bones, particularly the femur and tibia. Characterized by a nidus that secretes prostaglandins, leading to intense nocturnal pain. A CT scan is the investigation of choice (Osteoid osteoma is a cortical tumor. Hence, CT is superior to MRI which evaluates bone marrow & extent of tumors) , revealing a central radiolucent nidus accompanied by surrounding sclerosis and a Vascular groove sign (thin channel in the thickened bone around the nidus) It is managed by radiofrequency ablation. X-ray (Option A ) is used to diagnose fractures, joint conditions, tumours, and chest issues, as well as in dental assessments. It also guides treatment. Though an X-ray is the initial test for osteoid osteoma, CT provides better visualisation and confirms the diagnosis. MRI (Option B) is used to diagnose soft tissue pathologies, bone marrow conditions, and neurological disorders, but it is not preferred for osteoid osteoma as it can obscure the nidus. DEXA scan (Option C) measures bone mineral density to diagnose osteoporosis and assess fracture risk but is not preferred for osteoid osteoma as it does not provide detailed visualization of the lesion.

      "correct_answer": "D",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: D) Calcinosis cutis Explanation: The likely diagnosis is Rheumatoid arthritis (RA), a chronic inflammatory disease that typically presents with symmetrical joint involvement, prolonged morning stiffness, and systemic symptoms such as fatigue and low-grade fever. Symmetrical involvement of small joints, including the wrists, elbows, knees, ankles, metacarpophalangeal (MCP) and proximal interphalangeal (PIP) joints, with sparing of the distal interphalangeal (DIP) joints. RA commonly leads to characteristic hand deformities such as Boutonniere deformity (Option B) (flexion of the PIP joint and hyperextension of the DIP joint) Swan neck deformity (Option C) ( hyperextension of the PIP joint and flexion of the DIP joint) Hitchhiker's thumb (or Z-deformity) (Option A) , involving a hyperextension of the thumb's first joint. Calcinosis cutis is the abnormal deposition of calcium salts in the skin and subcutaneous tissues, narrowing the joint spaces. It commonly occurs in CREST syndrome and is not related to Rheumatoid arthritis.

      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: A) Normal vertebral findings Explanation: The given X-ray of the lumbar spine shows a fracture of the pars interarticularis , commonly associated with Spondylolysis . This condition is characterised by the appearance of a \"Scotty dog with a collar,\" which indicates a disruption of the Scotty dog appearance of normal lumbar vertebrae (Option A) Spine degeneration from wear and tear can cause back pain and may affect nearby nerves, resulting in radiating pain, numbness, or paresthesia along the corresponding dermatomes. This can lead to Stress fracture of Pars Interarticularis of vertebrae Spinal canal stenosis Spondylolisthesis Spondylolisthesis (Option B) occurs when a vertebra slips forward over the one below it, often leading to lower back pain and potential nerve compression. It is identified on an anterior-posterior (AP) X-ray by the inverted Napoleon hat sign in L5-S1 involvement and by the beheaded Scotty dog sign in a lateral view X-ray. Osteoporosis (Option C) is characterised by reduced bone mass and density, which increases the risk of fractures. It presents with a \"codfish\" appearance due to increased vertebral concavity, decreased bone density, cortical bone thinning, reduced trabecular patterns, and potential vertebral compression fractures.",

        "D": "<-2.5 with fracture"
      },
      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: C) <-2.5 Explanation: A Dual Energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) scan is primarily used to diagnose osteoporosis, assess fracture risk, and monitor drug therapy. The DXA scanner uses X-rays with two energy peaks, enabling the differential absorption of radiation by bone and soft tissue, which facilitates the calculation of bone mineral density (BMD). Interprets results using T-scores and Z-scores . T-score: It compares a patient's BMD to the average BMD of a healthy young adult of the same sex. It indicates how much the patient's bone density deviates from the optimal peak bone mass. WHO Criteria for Osteoporosis T score Interpretation >-1.0 (Option A) Normal BMD (bone mineral density) -1.0 to -2.5 (Option B) Osteopenia <-2.5 (Option C) Osteoporosis <-2.5 with fracture (Option D) Severe osteoporosis Z-score: It compares the patient's BMD to the average BMD of individuals of the same age and sex. It helps assess whether the bone density is within a normal range for that specific demographic group. Interpretation: A Z-score of -2.0 or lower may suggest significantly lower bone density compared to age-matched peers and may warrant further investigation into secondary causes of bone loss.
