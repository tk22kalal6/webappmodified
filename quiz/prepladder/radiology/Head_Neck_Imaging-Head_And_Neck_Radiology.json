      "correct_answer": "D",
      "explanation": "Osteomeatal Unit (OMU): Key structure in the middle meatus of the nasal cavity, serving as the drainage pathway for the frontal, anterior ethmoid, and maxillary sinuses. It is a crucial region because blockages here often lead to chronic or recurrent sinusitis. Components of the Osteomeatal Unit: Uncinate Process: A thin, curved bone that is part of the lateral nasal wall which serves as a boundary for the drainage pathways of the sinuses. Semilunar Hiatus: A crescent-shaped groove located beneath the middle nasal turbinate.It is the primary drainage pathway for the frontal, maxillary, and anterior ethmoidal sinuses. Ethmoidal Bulla: A prominent ethmoid air cell located just above the semilunar hiatus.It is the largest of the anterior ethmoid air cells and plays a role in sinus drainage. Infundibulum : A funnel-shaped passage that connects the maxillary sinus to the semilunar hiatus. Reference: Ct pns anatomy OMU",

      "explanation": "discharge, and the findings on CT imaging showing sinus mucosal thickening and frothy fluid appearnace indicate maxillary sinusitis. Sinusitis: Inflammation of the mucosal lining of the paranasal sinuses, often associated with infection/allergy. Types: Acute Sinusitis: Duration Symptoms lasting less than 4 weeks Radiology CT: Frothy appearance due to presence of bubbles in fluid Treatment Most cases resolve spontaneously; symptomatic relief with nasal decongestants, saline nasal sprays, and analgesics. Antibiotics if bacterial infection is suspected (typically after 7-10 days of symptoms). Subacute sinusitis: Symptoms lasting 4 to 12 weeks. Chronic sinusitis: Duration Symptoms lasting longer than 12 weeks. Radiology CT: Bony sclerosis is seen and no air. Treatment Intranasal corticosteroids to reduce inflammation. Saline irrigation. Antibiotics for bacterial exacerbations. Surgery (e.g., functional endoscopic sinus surgery) in refractory cases to improve drainage. Complications of sinusitis: Orbital cellulitis or abscess Osteomyelitis of the skull Meningitis Intracranial abscess Viral rhinitis ( Option A): presents with clear nasal discharge and lacks significant mucosal thickening or air-fluid levels on imaging. Allergic rhinitis (Option B): Allergic rhinitis is characterized by clear rhinorrhea, nasal itching, and sneezing, without purulent discharge or air-fluid levels.
