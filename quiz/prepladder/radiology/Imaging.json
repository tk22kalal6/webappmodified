      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "insufficiency insufficiency Explanation: An abnormal S/D ratio indicates increased resistance in placental blood flow, which may affect fetal growth and necessitate closer monitoring. Obstetric Doppler Applications Fetal Well-Being Assessment Crucial for evaluating blood flow in the fetus and placenta. An abnormal S/D ratio in umbilical artery Doppler indicates possible placental insufficiency and necessitates further evaluation. (Option B) High S/D ratio reflects increased resistance in placental blood flow, potentially affecting fetal growth. (Option A ruled out) S/D ratio>3 beyond 28 weeks is a marker of uteroplacental insufficiency Detection of Fetal Anemia Doppler assessment of middle cerebral artery (MCA) blood flow can indicate fetal anaemia. (Option B ruled out) MCA peak systolic velocity (>1.5 MoM) predicts moderate-to-severe fetal anemia Particularly relevant in blood-group allo-immunization cases, where fetal anemia is a severe risk. MCA Doppler in Growth Restriction While helpful for detecting fetal anaemia, its role in managing fetal growth restriction is unclear. An abnormal cerebroplacental ratio may indicate fetal distress, but its impact on delivery timing is not yet established as standard practice. (Option D ruled out) Ductus Venosus Assessment Like MCA Doppler, ductus venosus evaluation has not shown significant benefits in perinatal outcomes. Offers insights into cardiac dysfunction in severe growth restriction but is not routinely recommended for clinical management. Guiding Prenatal Procedures Doppler is instrumental in guiding prenatal interventions, including procedures like cordocentesis.",

      "explanation": "ultrasound refers to the increased peripheral vascularity surrounding an extrauterine mass or gestational sac. The presence of this peripheral vascularity, along with the absence of an intrauterine pregnancy, is a definitive radiologic feature of an ectopic pregnancy. Ectopic Pregnancy: Empty extrauterine sac with a hyperechoic ring. Extrauterine yolk sac and/or fetal pole with or without cardiac activity. Inhomogeneous adnexal mass or extrauterine halo-like structure - a probable ectopic pregnancy. Colour Doppler imaging: Placental blood flow within the periphery of an ectopic pregnancy - ring of fire appearance . (Option A) In ruptured ectopic, blood is present in the pouch of Douglas , which shows echoes on USG because of the presence of hemoperitoneum. Lambda sign (Option B): It is seen in dichorionic diamniotic twin pregnancies. Trilaminar appearance (Option C): The trilaminar appearance of the endometrium is normally seen in the late proliferative phase of the menstrual cycle. Double decidual sac sign (Option D): This sign confirms the presence of an intrauterine pregnancy and is not seen in ectopic pregnancy.",

      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "suggests an intrauterine pregnancy. At 5 weeks gestation, it is normal to see a gestational sac without the yolk sac or fetal pole, as these structures typically become visible by 5 to 6 weeks. Double decidual sac sign : (Option C) Suggestive of intrauterine pregnancy. (Option A ruled out) Two echogenic rings are seen surrounding the gestational sac, an inner decidua capsularis and an outer decidua parietalis. In between the two decidua is the uterine cavity. Early Pregnancy Ultrasound: Ultrasound is the imaging method of choice. In early pregnancy, transvaginal is more sensitive than trans-abdominal. Decidua is first formed as the thick hyperechoic endometrium. Structures visualized Gestational age (TVS) Key features Gestational sac 4.5 to 5 weeks First sign of pregnancy in an ultrasound Yolk sac 5 to 6 weeks First definitive sign of an intrauterine pregnancy.

      "explanation": "Hysterosalpingography (HSG), showing a right-side dilated, tortuous right fallopian tube with no contrast spillage into the peritoneal cavity. The contrast remains confined within the tube, indicating distal blockage. The most likely diagnosis is right hydrosalpinx. Hysterosalpingography It is a radiographic imaging technique. Indication: Infertility evaluation; to assess the endocervical canal, the endometrial cavity, and the fallopian tube lumina and patency. Procedure: Radiopaque contrast material is injected through the cervical canal. It is performed between cycle days 5 and 10. Normal findings: The spill of contrast from the tubes into the peritoneal cavity suggests patency of the fallopian tubes. The endometrial cavity is usually triangular and has a smooth contour. Contraindications: Acute pelvic infection Active uterine bleeding Pregnancy Iodine allergy Images: Normal",
