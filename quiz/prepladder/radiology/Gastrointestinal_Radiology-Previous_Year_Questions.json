It is primarily used for staging esophageal cancer , allowing assessment of: Depth of tumor invasion (T stage) Involvement of regional lymph nodes (N stage) Adjacent mediastinal structures EUS-guided fine-needle aspiration (FNA) can help in obtaining tissue samples from suspicious lymph nodes for accurate staging. Applications of Endoscopic Ultrasound (EUS) Application Primary Use Staging of esophageal cancer (Correct Answer) Evaluates tumor depth and lymph node involvement Pancreatic lesions Detects and biopsies pancreatic cysts, tumors, or chronic pancreatitis Subepithelial GI tumors Differentiates between leiomyomas, GISTs, and neuroendocrine tumors Biliary pathology Detects choledocholithiasis and bile duct strictures Rectal cancer staging Determines depth of invasion and lymph node involvement Evaluation of GERD (Option B): Incorrect because GERD is typically assessed with pH monitoring, manometry, or upper endoscopy , not EUS. Identifying the cause of dysphagia (Option C): Incorrect because barium swallow or esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) are first-line tests; EUS is used mainly for cancer staging or assessing submucosal lesions . Assessing cardiac and aortic pathology (Option D): Incorrect because transesophageal echocardiography (TEE), not EUS , is preferred for cardiac/aortic evaluation.",

      "explanation": "Correct Answer: A) Intussusception Explanation: Intussusception is a medical condition in which one segment of the intestine telescopes into another segment, causing an obstruction. In a barium enema procedure (as shown in the image), intussusception may appear as a characteristic ‘claw sign’ appearance, where the affected segment of the intestine invaginates into the adjacent segment. This is due to the filling defect it creates for the enema. Intussusception Intussusception occurs when one segment of the bowel is pulled into another, often leading to bowel obstruction and ischemia. It is a common cause of acute abdomen in children, while in adults, it is typically associated with a focal lesion acting as a lead point. The classic clinical presentation of intussusception in children may include intermittent abdominal pain, vomiting, and a palpable \"sausage-like\" mass in the right upper quadrant, although these symptoms occur in less than 20% of cases. Parents may also report \"currant jelly\" stools , indicating bowel ischemia, and approximately 15% of patients may present without abdominal pain. Plain",

      "explanation": "Correct Answer: B) Psoas abscess Explanation: A psoas abscess is the pus collection which is located in the iliopsoas compartment. The classical presentation is back pain, fever, and limping. The pain on passive extension occurs due to muscles causing friction against inflamed tissue. The CT scan demonstrates abnormal fluid collection surrounded by irregular rim enhancement. Pyelonephritis (Option A) is a bacterial infection causing inflammation of the kidney. It can cause fever and back pain but not limping. The pain will not be present on the passive extension of the hip. CT findings are enlargement of the kidney with thickened parenchyma and an Impairment of corticomedullary differentiation. Appendicitis (Option C) is an inflammation of the appendix. It causes pain in your lower right abdomen CT findings are dilated appendix with the wall thickening and adjacent mesenteric fat stranding. Torsion of right undescended testis (Option D) clinical symptoms include nonspecific abdominal pain, poor oral intake, vomiting, and restlessness.CT shows a well-circumscribed, isodense, or hetero-dense mass and had proper fine anatomic detail in locating the undescended testis.

      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: A) Jejunum Explanation: The clinical scenario and the X-ray findings of dilated bowel loops with visible valvulae conniventes suggest small bowel obstruction involving the jejunum. Valvulae conniventes (or plicae circulares): These are mucosal folds that run transversely across the lumen of the jejunum and proximal ileum. They are most prominent in the jejunum and appear as complete lines spanning the width of the bowel on X-ray. Investigations for Small Bowel Obstruction: Initial Diagnostic Test: Abdominal X-ray Erect View: Better for identifying air-fluid levels. Shows dilated bowel loops with multiple air-fluid levels in a step-ladder pattern. Supine View: Better for identifying the site of obstruction. Obstruction typically visible in the ileum. IOC-CECT (Contrast-Enhanced Computed Tomography): Used for: High-grade obstruction. Extraluminal causes of obstruction. Strangulation. Radiographic Features Jejunum Plicae circulares or valvulae conniventes Visible as circumferential, ring-like patterns. Multiple dilated bowel loops. Loops are centrally located. The mucosal pattern appears well-defined with a “feathery” appearance due to the plicae circulares. Ileum (Option B) Dilated bowel loops. Loops are centrally located.

      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: A) FAST Explanation: In the given scenario, the best investigation to be used in the emergency room is FAST (Focused Assessment with Sonography for Trauma). FAST is a rapid bedside ultrasound examination that is commonly used in the emergency setting to evaluate patients with suspected abdominal or thoracic trauma. It is a non-invasive and relatively quick procedure that can provide valuable information about potential injuries and guide further management. FAST (Focused Abdominal Sonography for Trauma) and eFAST (Extended FAST) : Purpose : Assess for free fluid in the abdominal cavity, thoracic cavities, and pericardium. Nature of Injury : Not used to determine the specific nature or extent of injury. Advantages : Rapid, reproducible, portable, and non-invasive bedside test. Can be performed simultaneously with resuscitation. Accurate at detecting >100 mL of free blood. Limitations : Operator-dependent and may be unreliable in obese patients or when the bowel is full of gas. Low sensitivity (29–35%) for detecting hollow viscus or solid organ injuries without haemoperitoneum. Unreliable for excluding injuries in penetrating trauma. Requires repeat or supplementary investigations if needed. Unreliable for assessing retroperitoneum. Diagnostic Peritoneal Lavage (DPL): (Option C) Purpose : Assess for the presence of blood or contaminants in the abdomen, valuable in resource-limited settings. Procedure : Nasogastric tube and urinary catheter placement. Cannula insertion below the umbilicus for aspiration and fluid infusion. The positive result is if Frank blood or contaminants are present, or If laboratory results show >100,000 red cells/µL or >500 white cells/µL or Amylase levels in the fluid of more than 175 IU/dl. Drainage of lavage fluid via a chest drain indicates diaphragm penetration. Limitations : Largely replaced by eFAST but remains the standard in some settings where eFAST is unavailable or unreliable. Contraindications: When laparotomy is indicated Previous laparotomy Pregnancy Obesity X-ray (Option B): are less sensitive in detecting injuries to internal organs. Therefore, it may not be the best initial investigation for this patient. CT scan (Option B): Gold standard for detailed assessment but requires a stable patient. This patient is hypotensive, making CT less ideal initially.",

      "explanation": "Correct Answer: A) Rat-tail sign Explanation: Dysphagia that is more pronounced for liquids than solids suggests achalasia , a motility disorder of the esophagus. Achalasia is characterized by failure of the lower esophageal sphincter (LES) to relax , leading to progressive dilation of the esophagus with tapering at the gastroesophageal junction. On barium swallow , achalasia classically shows a \"Rat-tail sign\" —a smooth, gradual narrowing at the distal esophagus due to the non-relaxing LES. Radiological Signs in Esophageal Disorders Radiological Sign Associated Condition Appearance Rat-tail sign (Correct Answer) Achalasia Smooth tapering of the esophagus at the LES Filling defect Esophageal tumors, strictures Irregular defect in the barium column Corkscrew esophagus Diffuse esophageal spasm (DES) Multiple non-peristaltic contractions creating a \"corkscrew\" pattern Apple-core lesion Esophageal or colonic cancer Constricted lumen with irregular edges, resembling an apple core Filling defect (Option B) is incorrect because a filling defect is a non-specific radiological finding seen in conditions like oesophageal tumours, varices, or strictures . It does not typically present with dysphagia that is worse for liquids. Corkscrew oesophagus (Option C) is incorrect because it is seen in diffuse oesophageal spasm (DES) , which presents with intermittent chest pain and dysphagia for both solids and liquids , rather than a progressive pattern. Apple-core lesion (Option D) is incorrect because it is a characteristic finding in colorectal cancer , not an oesophageal disorder.",

Causes: Common: Perforated peptic ulcers, bowel obstruction, inflammatory conditions, ischemia, injury during colonoscopy. Other causes without peritonitis: Postoperative (up to 7 days), peritoneal dialysis, sealed perforation, and tracking from pneumomediastinum. Diagnosis on Imaging: Erect CXR: Free gas seen under the right hemidiaphragm (cupola sign) , difficult to differentiate on the left due to gastric or colonic gas. Supine AXR: Right upper quadrant gas in the perihepatic, subhepatic space, Morrison’s pouch, and ligament visualization (e.g., falciform ligament). Rigler’s Sign: Visualization of both sides of the bowel wall due to surrounding gas. CT Scan: Most sensitive; small volumes of gas seen in the liver or peritoneal recesses, often using broad window settings. Pseudo-pneumoperitoneum: Conditions mimicking free gas such as Chilaiditi syndrome (intestine between liver and diaphragm), subphrenic abscess, or subdiaphragmatic fat.

While acute intestinal obstruction can cause distension of the bowel and the accumulation of gas and fluid , it typically does not result in free air under the diaphragm. The presence of free air under the diaphragm is more suggestive of perforation or leakage of air from a hollow organ into the peritoneal cavity. Incorrect options Option A: Duodenal ulcer perforatio n refers to a complication of a duodenal ulcer in which a hole forms in the wall of the duodenum. This can result in the leakage of gastrointestinal contents into the peritoneal cavity, leading to a condition called pneumoperitoneum. Pneumoperitoneum can be visualized on an X-ray as free air under the diaphragm, indicating the presence of air in the abdominal cavity. Option B: Post laparoscopy refers to the period following a laparoscopic surgery. During laparoscopy, carbon dioxide gas is used to inflate the abdominal cavity, creating space for the surgeon to operate. After the surgery, some residual carbon dioxide gas may remain in the abdomen. This residual gas can be visualized on an X-ray as small pockets of air or gas bubbles. Option C: Chilaiditi syndrome is a rare condition characterized by the interposition of the colon between the liver and the diaphragm. This can lead to the trapping of gas in the colonic segments under the liver, resulting in the appearance of gas-filled spaces on an X-ray.

      "question": "What would be your subsequent step when encountering a child who has a documented case of ingesting a button battery?",
      "options": {
        "A": "Give oral fluids",
        "B": "Remove endoscopically",
        "C": "Reassure and check whether passed in stools",
        "D": "Induce vomiting"
      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "would typically be to remove the battery endoscopically. Button batteries are small, round batteries commonly found in devices such as remote controls, toys, and watches. Ingestion of a button battery is considered a medical emergency due to the potential risks and complications it can cause. These batteries can cause significant damage to the esophagus and other nearby structures if they get stuck or become lodged. Incorrect Options: Option A . Giving oral fluids: While maintaining hydration is important, giving oral fluids is not the appropriate next step when a child has ingested a button battery. Prompt removal of the battery is necessary to minimize the risk of complications. Option C . Reassure and check whether passed in stools: Ingested button batteries should not be assumed to pass through the digestive system without complications. Button batteries can cause serious harm if they get lodged or cause damage to the gastrointestinal tract. Therefore, reassurance and waiting for the battery to pass in stools are not appropriate actions. Option D . Inducing vomiting: Inducing vomiting is not recommended in cases of button battery ingestion. The battery can cause damage while being regurgitated, and it is important to avoid further injury to the esophagus or surrounding tissues. Reference: .",
