      "question": "A patient presents with a neck mass and laboratory findings of increased T4 and decreased TSH. The patient has a history of I-131 ablation therapy. Which of the following is a likely side effect of the treatment?",
      "options": {
        "A": "Acute Thyroiditis",
        "B": "Hypothyroidism",
        "C": "Hyperthyroidism",
        "D": "Thyroid Storm"

      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "nodules, or thyroid cancer . It destroys thyroid tissue , leading to a progressive decline in thyroid hormone production , resulting in hypothyroidism over time. Patients often require lifelong thyroid hormone replacement therapy (levothyroxine) . . Side Effects of I-131 Therapy Side Effect Mechanism Common in Hypothyroidism (Correct Answer) Destruction of thyroid tissue → ↓ T4, ↑ TSH Most patients post-I-131 therapy Acute Thyroiditis Radiation-induced inflammation → temporary thyroid pain, swelling Early post-treatment phase Hyperthyroidism Thyrotoxic phase due to sudden hormone release from damaged cells Rare, transient Thyroid Storm Massive release of thyroid hormones (life-threatening) Very rare, usually in untreated Graves' Acute Thyroiditis (Option A) is incorrect because although I-131 therapy can cause radiation thyroiditis , this is a transient inflammatory reaction rather than a long-term side effect. Hypothyroidism (Option B) is incorrect in the short term but is the most common long-term consequence of I-131 therapy due to progressive thyroid destruction. Patients often require lifelong levothyroxine replacement therapy . Thyroid Storm (Option D) is incorrect because thyroid storm is a severe, life-threatening hyperthyroid crisis typically seen in untreated or inadequately treated hyperthyroidism , not a direct consequence of I-131 therapy.

      "question": "Radioisotope used in PET-CT scan?",

        "A": "18F-FDG",
        "B": "lodine",
        "C": "Radium",

      },
      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: A) 18F-FDG Explanation: 18F-FDG (Fluorodeoxyglucose) is the most commonly used radiotracer in PET-CT scans. It is a glucose analog labeled with the radioactive isotope Fluorine-18. It accumulates in tissues with high glucose metabolism, such as cancer cells, inflammation, or infection, making it highly useful for diagnosing and staging cancers, monitoring treatment response, and detecting recurrent disease. Fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) positron-emission tomography (PET-FDG) Uptake of 18F-FDG (Analogue of endogenous glucose) in large quantities by cancer cells as compared to normal cells Application: Quantification of tumor metabolic activity Diagnosis (lung cancer) and Staging of cancer Assessing distant metastasis More sensitive in primary lung and oesophageal cancer metastatic disease Assessment of response to treatment A decrease in FDG uptake after chemotherapy indicates that the tumor is responding to treatment Routine surveillance following treatment- not commonly preferred. Not useful in the following situations: High Glycolytic Metabolism tissues: Central nervous system tumors. Inflammation vs. Cancer: Both conditions exhibit increased glucose metabolism. Movement disorders Coronary blood flow Warburg Effect Cancer cells prefer glycolysis over oxidative phosphorylation, even in the presence of oxygen. This leads to increased glucose uptake and lactate production , common in many cancers. 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose (18F-FDG) , a glucose analog used in PET imaging, helps study this effect. Mechanisms of 18F-FDG Accumulation Mechanism Description Aerobic Glycolysis Cancer cells rely heavily on glycolysis, increasing glucose and 18F-FDG uptake, even with oxygen. Transport & Trapping GLUT-1 transporters mediate glucose entry. 18F-FDG is phosphorylated and trapped inside cells. Tumor Heterogeneity Differences in tumor subtype, size, and microvasculature affect 18F-FDG uptake. Clinical Implications of 18F-FDG Implication Details Prognostic Indicator Higher 18F-FDG uptake correlates with worse prognosis (e.g., shorter DFS in invasive ductal carcinoma). Reverse Warburg Effect Cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) increase glycolysis in tumor cells via metabolic coupling. Treatment Monitoring PET imaging tracks changes in 18F-FDG uptake, reflecting therapy responses targeting glycolysis or mitochondria. Iodine (Option B): Radioactive iodine (e.g., I-131 or I-123) is mainly used in thyroid imaging and treatment of thyroid disorders Radium (Option C): Radium-223 is used in the treatment of bone metastases (e.g., in prostate cancer) Cesium-131 (Option D): Cesium-131 is used in brachytherapy for localized radiation delivery (e.g., in prostate cancer)",

        "C": "Cobalt-60",
        "D": "lodine-131"
      },
      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: C) Cobalt-60 Explanation: Cobalt-60 is the most commonly used radioactive isotope in teletherapy, a type of external beam radiotherapy. It emits high-energy gamma rays, which are effective for treating deep-seated tumors. Teletherapy (External beam radiation) It is a form of radiation therapy in which the radiation source is placed at a distance from the body, delivering high-energy radiation beams to treat tumors. External beam sources are: Betatron Cobalt Linear accelerator Neutron beam Photon beam Proton beam Spray radiation Stereotactic radiosurgery such as gamma knife X-ray Types of Beams Electrons Negatively charged particles Limited penetration Effective for tumors near the body surface (Skin tumors) Photons Can reach deep tumors Scatter radiation along the path Continue through normal tissue after reaching the tumor Made up of high energy: X-rays (LINAC- Linear accelerators) Gamma rays Protons Positively charged particles No radiation scatter Stop precisely at the tumor location cobalt 60 (Co 60 ) Linear accelerator The Cobalt machine produces an artificial radioisotope (Co ) Advantage: Relative constancy of beam output Source replacement approximately every 4 to 5 years LINAC- Linear accelerators do not need a radioisotope The fast-moving electron beam generates radiation which is used in radiotherapy X-ray beams are produced A dvantages of External Beam Painless Do not require a hospital stay in most patients Most patients can continue with their normal daily activities Non-invasive Iridium-192 (Option A): Used in brachytherapy, especially for treating cancers of the cervix, breast, and prostate. Iodine-125 (Option B): Used in brachytherapy, particularly for prostate cancer and eye plaques (e.g., choroidal melanoma). Iodine-131 (Option D): Used in the treatment of thyroid cancer and hyperthyroidism but not in teletherapy.

      "question": "What is the name of the radiotherapy treatment given to a cancer patient that involves administering a dose of 1.8 to 2 Gy once daily for 5 days per week over a period of 6 to 8 weeks?",
      "options": {
        "A": "Regular Fractionated radiotherapy",
        "B": "Hyper fractionated radiotherapy",
        "C": "Accelerated fractionation radiotherapy",
        "D": "Brachytherapy"
      },
      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: A) Regular Fractionated radiotherapy Explanation: Regular Fractionated Radiotherapy : This is the standard treatment regimen in radiotherapy for many cancers. The patient receives a dose of 1.8 to 2 Gy per day , typically administered once daily for 5 days a week (Monday to Friday), with a total treatment course lasting between 6 to 8 weeks . This approach allows for normal tissue recovery while delivering effective doses to the cancerous tissue. Fractionated Radiotherapy Definition : Treatment in multiple smaller doses (fractions) to enhance tumor control and protect normal tissue. Key Principles Therapeutic Window : Balances damage to tumor vs. normal tissue using the \"5 Rs of Radiobiology\": Radiosensitivity : Tumor cells are more sensitive to radiation. Repair : Normal tissue repairs better between treatments. Reoxygenation : Hypoxic tumor cells reoxygenate, increasing sensitivity. Redistribution : Cells cycle through phases of varying sensitivity. Repopulation : Normal tissue regeneration, affecting treatment outcomes. Fraction Size and Dose : Standard doses are 1.8-2 Gy per session, totaling 50-66 Gy over weeks. Advances in Fractionation Technique Key Features Spatially Fractionated Radiation Therapy (SFRT) Delivers heterogeneous doses to spare normal tissue, effective in bulky tumors. Hyperfractionation More frequent, smaller doses to enhance local control. Accelerated Fractionation Shortens overall treatment time, maintaining or enhancing efficacy. Challenges Radioresistance : Tumors may develop resistance, requiring careful dose planning. Scheduling : Ideal fractionation depends on tumor type, size, and location; research is ongoing Hyper fractionated Radiotherapy (option B) : Incorrect because in hyperfractionated radiotherapy, smaller doses of radiation (usually 1.2 to 1.5 Gy ) are given multiple times a day (typically twice), rather than once daily. Accelerated Fractionation Radiotherapy (option C) : Incorrect because accelerated fractionation involves delivering radiation doses more frequently, often with a shorter overall treatment duration (e.g., increasing the daily dose or increasing the frequency of radiation delivery within a shorter period). Brachytherapy (option D) : Incorrect because brachytherapy is a type of radiotherapy where a radioactive source is placed directly inside or very close to the tumor. It is typically used for specific cancers (e.g., prostate, cervical) rather than the fractionated external beam therapy described in the question.",

      },
      "correct_answer": "D",
      "explanation": "disorders, can lead to various side effects due to the proximity of critical structures in the brain. Hypopituitarism: This is the most common long-term side effect. Radiation can damage the normal pituitary tissue, leading to deficiencies in pituitary hormones (e.g., growth hormone, thyroid-stimulating hormone, or gonadotropins). Increased risk of cerebrovascular accident (CVA): Radiation exposure to nearby vascular structures, such as the carotid arteries, can lead to vascular damage and increase the risk of strokes or transient ischemic attacks over time. Optic nerve damage: Radiation can damage the optic nerves or the optic chiasm, leading to visual deficits such as visual field loss or, in severe cases, blindness.

      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: A) S phase Explanation: The S phase of the cell cycle is the most radioresistant phase. During this phase, the DNA is actively being replicated, and mechanisms for DNA repair are highly active, providing protection against radiation-induced damage. M phase (option B): This is incorrect because the M phase (mitosis) is the most radiosensitive phase due to the condensed state of chromosomes and limited time for DNA repair mechanisms to function. G1 phase (option C): This is incorrect because cells in the G1 phase are moderately sensitive to radiation. However, their sensitivity depends on whether they are preparing for DNA synthesis. G2 phase (option D): This is incorrect because the G2 phase is also a radiosensitive phase, as the cell prepares for mitosis and DNA repair capacity is lower than in the S phase.

        "A": "Spermatogonia",
        "B": "Intestinal epithelial cells",
        "C": "Neurons",
        "D": "Bone marrow/ erythroid precursor cells"
      },
      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: C) Neurons Explanation: Neurons are terminally differentiated, non-dividing cells. Their low mitotic activity makes them relatively resistant to radiation-induced damage. According to the Law of Bergonie: The more the cells are rapidly dividing, the more they are sensitive to radiation. M-phase (dividing phase) is the most radiosensitive phase S-phase (Synthesizing phase) is the most radioresistant phase Most radiosensitive tissue in the body is Bone marrow (rapidly dividing). Most radioresistant tissue in the body is neurons (non-dividing). Most radiosensitive cells in the blood are lymphocytes. The most radioresistant cell in the blood is the platelet. The most radioresistant organ in the body is the vagina. Spermatogonia (Option A): are highly radiosensitive because they are actively dividing cells. Irradiation can severely affect spermatogenesis. Intestinal epithelial cells (Option B): are composed of rapidly dividing cells. It has one of the highest turnover rates in the body, making it highly sensitive to radiation. Bone marrow/erythroid precursor cells (Option D): Bone marrow cells, including erythroid precursors, are highly proliferative and sensitive to radiation. Irradiation often results in significant suppression of hematopoiesis. Reference: https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7312565/#:~:text",

      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "I-131 is also used for the treatment of benign hyperthyroid conditions. It is, however, not used in any form of brachytherapy. Therefore, option b is the correct answer. In brachytherapy, a radiation source is placed inside the body of tumor tissue or on the body of tumor tissue. This minimizes radiation exposure to the persons handling it and also to the person who is receiving brachytherapy. Incorrect Options: Option A - Iodine- 125: I-125, with a half-life of 60 days, is the most common radioactive isotope used in permanent interstitial brachytherapy. Hence, it is an incorrect choice. Option B - Cobalt- 60: These radioactive isotopes are produced by neutron activation of stable cobalt-59. They have a half-life of 5.27 years. These have been used in intracavitary or HDR brachytherapy for a long. Therefore, it is an incorrect choice. Option D - Iridium-192: Iridium-192 is produced by neutron activation of stable Iridium-191. They have a half-life of 73.83 days. These radioactive isotopes are used in HDR brachytherapy.

Instead, their energy deposition decreases gradually as they pass through tissue. Option C: Neutron- Neutrons are electrically neutral particles found in the atomic nucleus. Neutrons have a different interaction mechanism with tissue compared to protons. While they can cause ionization and biological damage, they do not exhibit a pronounced Bragg peak effect like protons. Neutrons have a more gradual energy deposition profile as they penetrate through tissue. Option D: Electron- Electrons are negatively charged particles that are commonly used in radiation therapy. Electrons have a different energy deposition pattern compared to protons. They typically deposit their energy in a continuous manner along their path, without a distinct Bragg peak effect",
