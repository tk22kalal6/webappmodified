      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Correct answer: C) Adrenal adenoma Explanation: A smooth, round, hypoechoic lesion with low vascularity and a size of 2.5 cm is typical of a benign adrenal adenoma. The hallmark is a non-contrast CT density of 8 HU, indicating low attenuation (<10 HU), distinguishing it from other adrenal lesions. Adrenal Adenoma (Option C) Pheochromocytoma (Option A ruled out) Adrenal Calcification (Option B ruled out) Common benign tumour, often hormonally inactive and less than 3 cm. Ultrasound : Smooth, round, hypoechoic, and low vascularity. CT : • Non-contrast shows a low density (<10 HU) if lipid-rich, and 10–30 HU if lipid-poor. • Rapid enhancement with >60% washout on contrast-enhanced CT. MRI : Signal drop on T1 out-of-phase imaging due to intralesional lipid. Rare adrenal medulla tumour that secretes catecholamines. CT : Heterogeneous and strongly enhancing. MRI : • T2 is hyperintense with a \"light bulb\" appearance. • No signal loss on out-of-phase imaging. • Fluid–fluid levels may indicate haemorrhage. MIBG : Localizes tumour via increased adrenal uptake. May result from old haemorrhage, infection, or various diseases (e.g., tuberculosis, neuroblastoma). Plain X-ray : Calcifications may be diffuse, stippled, or arc-like depending on the cause. CT : • Early tuberculosis: Enlarged adrenal with peripheral enhancement. • Advanced tuberculosis: Atrophic adrenals with scattered calcifications. Metastasis (Option D): Metastatic lesions generally demonstrate higher attenuation values on non-contrast CT due to their lipid-poor nature. They often appear as irregular masses, which contrasts with the smooth and well-defined appearance of the lesion described here.",

It does not cause sloughing of the papilla or filling defects in the pelvicalyceal system like renal papillary necrosis. Ureteral stricture (Option C): A ureteral stricture causes narrowing of the ureter and may lead to obstruction of urine flow, but it does not cause filling defects within the calyces. Vesicoureteric reflux (Option D): This involves the abnormal backward flow of urine from the bladder into the ureters. However, VUR does not result in the sloughing of papillae or filling defects in the renal pelvicalyceal system, which are key features of renal papillary necrosis.",

Ultrasound (USG): Shows an enlarged kidney with echogenic staghorn calculi and hypoechoic masses replacing renal parenchyma. Plain Abdominal X-ray: Detects gas in the kidney region in about 70% of cases. Contrast-enhanced CT: Most sensitive, showing wedge-shaped hypodense areas, striated nephrograms, and pelvic wall thickening. CT Scan reveals a non-functioning kidney, staghorn calculus, expanded calyces, and inflammatory changes . A characteristic bear paw sign is noted. CT: Gold standard, reveals gas within the kidney, renal enlargement, perinephric stranding and abscesses. Helps classify into Type 1 (gas without fluid) or Type 2 (gas with fluid). Acute infection of the kidney involving the renal parenchyma and collecting system is usually caused by ascending bacteria. • It is a chronic granulomatous response to recurrent renal infection - that leads to the destruction of renal parenchyma and its replacement by lipid-laden foamy macrophages. • Destruction spreads from the renal pelvis → medulla → cortex. • Usually, staghorn calculus is present in the pelvis. Severe necrotizing infection with gas accumulation in and around the kidney, primarily in diabetic patients. Acute lobar nephronia (Option D): It is a localized form of acute pyelonephritis that affects one or more kidney lobes. It presents with mass-like lesions and poor perfusion in the affected area but is not associated with staghorn calculi or such widespread renal changes as seen in this case.",

Antenatal hydronephrosis is also a common presentation of PUJ obstruction. Feature PUJ Obstruction Vesicoureteric (VUR) Staghorn Calculus Location Narrowing at the junction of the renal pelvis and ureter. Retrograde urine flows from the bladder into the ureters. Large, branched stone within the renal pelvis and calyces Cause Commonly: Congenital defect in ureteral muscle development. Less commonly: Compression by an aberrant or accessory renal artery branch. Malformation of the distal ureter, leading to an inadequate valve mechanism at the vesicoureteric junction Urinary tract infection with urease-producing bacteria in the setting of alkaline urine and elevated ammonia levels. Presentation Neonates: Antenatally detected hydronephrosis. Older children/Adults: Palpable mass, intermittent flank/abdominal pain Antenatal hydronephrosis, recurrent urinary tract infections Symptoms of urinary tract infection (e.g., pain, fever, frequent urination), flank pain, haematuria Imaging Ultrasound: Visualisation of hydronephrosis.

Urinary Tract Calculi Type of Calculi Description Characteristics Imaging Findings Ureteric Calculi (Option A ruled out) These are stones located in the ureters, which carry urine from the kidneys to the bladder. Size impacts the likelihood of spontaneous passage: • <5 mm: High chance of passing naturally. • >10 mm: Less likely to pass without intervention. • Identified via CT urography. • Can lead to hydronephrosis if it obstructs urine flow. • White areas in the KUB X-ray indicate calcifications observed in the paravertebral location. Vesical Calculi (Option B ruled out) Stones that are found in the bladder. Stones can either get impacted at the vesicoureteric junction or be mobile in the bladder. • CT urography is valuable for differentiation between the two. • Prone positioning during imaging aids in differentiation. • Usually appears as a dense calcification in the centre of the pelvis. Popcorn Calcification A radiological finding associated with severely calcified uterine fibroids (leiomyomas). • Irregular, scattered calcifications resembling popped corn. • Common in postmenopausal women with degenerative changes in fibroids. • On X-ray: Pelvic mass with severe calcification, characteristic popcorn pattern. • On CT: clearer visualisation confirming calcified leiomyoma.
