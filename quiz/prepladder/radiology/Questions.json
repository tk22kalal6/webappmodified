      "explanation": "Correct Answer: A) Superficial temporal artery Explanation: This MR Angiogram highlights an extracranial artery marked by the arrow, which runs along the lateral aspect of the skull. The superficial temporal artery (STA) is a branch of the external carotid artery, supplying the scalp, temporalis muscle, and forehead. It is commonly seen in angiographic imaging due to its superficial location and prominent branching pattern. Magnetic Resonance Angiography (MRA) There are various types of MR angiograms based on different principles and can be classified into non-contrast and contrast enhanced methods. Non-contrast MRA Contrast enhanced (CE) MRA Time-of-flight (TOF) imaging: It is the most prevalent method for Magnetic Resonance Angiography (MRA) in clinical practice. Phase-contrast MRA: It is more sensitive for identifying slow blood flow and useful for imaging cerebral veins (MR venography or MRV). Effective for detecting dural venous sinus thrombosis and venous",
