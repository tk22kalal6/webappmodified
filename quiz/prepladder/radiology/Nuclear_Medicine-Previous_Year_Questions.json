      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: A) Tc99-Sestamibi scan Explanation: A Tc99-Sestamibi scan is the investigation of choice for diagnosing a parathyroid adenoma . This nuclear medicine scan uses a radiolabeled compound, Tc99m-sestamibi, which is preferentially absorbed by overactive parathyroid tissue, helping in localizing the adenoma. It is highly sensitive and effective in detecting parathyroid adenomas, especially when combined with other imaging techniques such as ultrasound or CT. Diagnosis of Parathyroid Adenoma A parathyroid adenoma is a benign tumor of the parathyroid gland that can cause primary hyperparathyroidism due to excess production of parathyroid hormone (PTH). The most common symptoms are related to hypercalcemia, such as kidney stones, osteoporosis, and fatigue. Imaging is crucial to identify the adenoma, which guides the surgical treatment. Imaging in Parathyroid Adenoma Investigation Findings Role in Diagnosis Tc99-Sestamibi Scan Increased uptake in adenoma with delayed washout Gold standard for localization Sestamibi SPECT (Option B ruled out) 3D imaging improves localization Used when localization is unclear Ultrasound (USG) (Option C ruled out) Hypoechoic, well-defined lesion near thyroid First-line for initial screening, but less sensitive than Sestamibi CT (4D-CT preferred) (Option D ruled out) Enhances vascular lesion detection Used when other modalities fail Reference: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32193593/ Harrison’s Principles of Internal Medicine, 21st Edition, Volume I, Page 31776-3178.

      "question": "Most common radio-isotope in pet scan :",
      "options": {
        "A": "13C",
        "B": "14C",
        "C": "18F",
        "D": "All of the above"
      },
      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Correct answer C) 18F Explanation: Positron Emission Tomography (PET) scans use radioisotopes that emit positrons , which are detected to create high-resolution images of metabolic activity in tissues. Fluorine-18 (¹ I F) is the most commonly used radioisotope in PET scans. It is incorporated into Fluorodeoxyglucose (¹ I F-FDG) , a glucose analogue that helps in imaging cancer, brain disorders, and cardiac viability . Half-life of ¹ I F: ~110 minutes → Ideal for clinical imaging. 13C (Carbon-13) (Option A) It is not a positron emitter, but it is used in stable isotope metabolic studies rather than PET scans. Commonly used in breath tests (e.g., H. pylori urea breath test). 14C (Carbon-14) (Option B) A beta-emitting isotope used in radioactive labelling, but not PET imaging. Used in carbon dating and metabolic studies. All of the Above (Option D) is incorrect, as only ¹ I F is commonly used in PET scanning.
