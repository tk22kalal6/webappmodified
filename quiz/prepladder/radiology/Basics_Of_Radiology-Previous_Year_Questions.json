        "A": "Gl manifestations occur at a lower radiation dose than bone marrow depression",
        "B": "Doses greater than 2 Gy cause hematopoietic syndrome with pancytopenia",
        "C": "Doses greater than 6 Gy cause GI syndrome with dehydration",
        "D": "Doses greater than 20 -30 Gy cause Cardiovascular syndrome"
      },
      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "levels. The hematopoietic (bone marrow) syndrome occurs at a lower radiation dose ( ≥ 2 Gy), while gastrointestinal (GI) syndrome occurs at a higher dose ( ≥ 6 Gy). Therefore, it is incorrect to state that GI symptoms appear at a lower dose than bone marrow depression, making Option A false . Acute Radiation Syndrome (ARS) ARS occurs due to high doses of ionizing radiation and is classified into three main syndromes: Syndrome Radiation Dose (Gy) Clinical Features Hematopoietic Syndrome >2 Gy Pancytopenia, infections, bleeding, anemia Gastrointestinal Syndrome >6 Gy Nausea, vomiting, dehydration, diarrhea, shock Cardiovascular/CNS Syndrome >30 Gy Hypotension, seizures, coma, cardiovascular collapse IIIIIII Doses greater than 2 Gy cause hematopoietic syndrome with pancytopenia (Option B): Correct because bone marrow suppression occurs at doses above 2 Gy. Doses greater than 6 Gy cause GI syndrome with dehydration (Option C): Correct because GI symptoms appear at higher doses (>6 Gy), leading to severe dehydration. Doses greater than 20-30 Gy cause cardiovascular syndrome (Option D): Correct because cardiovascular and CNS symptoms occur at doses exceeding 30 Gy, leading to rapid fatality.

      },
      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "arachnoid, which is one of the membranes that surround the spinal cord and nerves. It can result in the adherence of the arachnoid and the formation of scar tissue, leading to the compression and distortion of the nerves within the thecal sac. This can cause symptoms such as chronic pain, numbness, tingling, and weakness. On MRI, the empty thecal sac sign may be observed, indicating reduced cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) within the thecal sac due to adhesions or fibrosis. Incorrect Options: Option B . Discitis: Discitis refers to inflammation of the intervertebral disc. It is often caused by infection, although non-infectious causes can also be involved. Discitis can lead to disc space narrowing, destruction of the vertebral endplates, and adjacent vertebral body involvement. However, it does not typically result in an empty thecal sac sign on MRI. Option C . Vertebral osteomyelitis: Vertebral osteomyelitis is an infection of the vertebral body. It can occur due to bacterial, fungal, or other microbial infections. MRI findings in vertebral osteomyelitis include vertebral body edema, marrow signal abnormality, and enhancement. However, it does not typically result in an empty thecal sac sign. Option D . Tethered cord syndrome: Tethered cord syndrome occurs when the spinal cord is abnormally attached to surrounding tissues, restricting its normal movement. It can lead to various symptoms, including lower back pain, leg weakness or numbness, and bladder or bowel dysfunction. While tethered cord syndrome may be evaluated with MRI, it does not typically result in an empty thecal sac sign. Reference: .",

      "question": "Which of the following is not included in Rigler's triad, as observed in a middle-aged female patient with a past medical history of cholelithiasis, who presented with symptoms of vomiting and abdominal pain, and whose abdominal radiograph revealed Rigler's triad?",
      "options": {
        "A": "Pneumobilia",
        "B": "Small bowel obstruction",
        "C": "Ectopic gallstone",
        "D": "Large bowel obstruction"
      },
      "correct_answer": "D",
      "explanation": "obstruction in the large intestine or colon. It can be caused by factors such as colorectal cancer, diverticulitis, volvulus, or strictures. However, in the case of Rigler's triad, which is associated with gallstone ileus, the obstruction primarily occurs in the small bowel rather than the large bowel. Therefore, large bowel obstruction is not a component of Rigler's triad. Incorrect Options: Option A . Pneumobilia: Pneumobilia refers to the presence of air or gas within the biliary tree, which includes the gallbladder and bile ducts. It is typically seen as air-filled structures in imaging studies, such as X-rays or CT scans. Pneumobilia can occur due to various reasons, including communication between the gastrointestinal tract and the biliary system, such as in cases of gallstone ileus or biliary-enteric fistulas. Option B . Small bowel obstruction: Small bowel obstruction is a condition where there is a blockage or obstruction in the small intestine, preventing the normal flow of intestinal contents. It can be caused by various factors, including adhesions, hernias, tumors, or in the case of Rigler's triad, a gallstone causing obstruction in the small bowel. Symptoms of small bowel obstruction may include abdominal pain, distension, nausea, and vomiting. Option C . Ectopic gallstone: An ectopic gallstone refers to the presence of a gallstone in an abnormal location within the gastrointestinal tract. In the context of gallstone ileus, the gallstone typically moves from the gallbladder or bile ducts into the small bowel through a cholecystoenteric fistula. This abnormal connection allows the gallstone to pass into the intestines and potentially causes obstruction.",

      "explanation": "GI , involves the administration of barium contrast to visualize the stomach and upper gastrointestinal tract. The radiograph shown appears to be a study of the stomach, which aligns with a barium meal examination. Incorrect options Option A: Barium swallow typically involves the ingestion of barium contrast to visualize the esophagus and upper gastrointestinal tract. The radiograph shown is not specific to the esophagus alone, but rather includes the entire stomach and possibly the small intestine. Therefore, a barium swallow is not the most appropriate investigation for the radiograph. Option C: Barium meal follow through involves the sequential imaging of the stomach and small intestine after ingestion of barium contrast. While the radiograph shown may include the stomach and possibly the upper small intestine, it does not specifically demonstrate the entire course of the small intestine. Therefore, a barium meal follow through is not the most accurate option.

      },
      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: A) TLD badge Explanation: Personal monitoring of radiation exposure is primarily done using thermoluminescent dosimeters (TLD badges). These devices measure the cumulative radiation dose received by an individual over time. The TLD contains a material (usually lithium fluoride) that absorbs radiation and emits light when heated, which is proportional to the amount of radiation exposure. TLD (Thermoluminescent Dosimeter) Badge Purpose It is worn by individuals in radiation-exposed environments, such as medical imaging or nuclear facilities, to track their radiation dose and ensure it stays within safe limits. Location Worn beneath the lead apron (as lead apron cuts off some radiation) Duration According to the Atomic Energy Regulatory Board (AERB) of India, TLD badges are generally replaced and analyzed every 3 months to assess cumulative radiation exposure. Composition Thermoluminescent phosphor crystals : Calcium sulfate dysprosium Lithium fluoride Lithium borate Berrylium oxide Principle Collimators (Option B): are devices used in imaging techniques like radiography, CT scans, and gamma cameras to shape and limit the radiation beam. They help in directing the radiation to a specific area of interest and reducing unnecessary radiation exposure to surrounding tissues. Linear accelerator (Option C): a device used in radiation therapy to deliver high-energy X-rays or electron beams to treat cancer. Grid (Option D): is a device used in radiography to reduce scattered radiation and improve image quality. It is placed between the patient and the image receptor.",

      "options": {
        "A": "Testis",
        "B": "Bone",
        "C": "Nerve",
        "D": "Muscle"
      },
      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: A) Testis Explanation: Radiosensitivity refers to the susceptibility of tissues or cells to damage from ionizing radiation. It is influenced by the Law of Bergonié and Tribondeau , which states that rapidly dividing, undifferentiated cells are more sensitive to radiation. Testis : Highly radiosensitive due to the presence of rapidly dividing spermatogonia in the germinal epithelium. Even low doses of radiation can impair spermatogenesis, making it the most radiosensitive tissue among the options. According to the Law of Bergonie: The more the cells are rapidly dividing, the more they are sensitive to radiation. M-phase (dividing phase) is the most radiosensitive phase S-phase (Synthesizing phase) is the most radioresistant phase Most radiosensitive tissue in the body is Bone marrow (rapidly dividing). Most radioresistant tissue in the body is neurons (non-dividing). Most radiosensitive cells in the blood are lymphocytes. The most radioresistant cell in the blood is the platelet. The most radioresistant organ in the body is the vagina. Bone (Option B): Bones, especially mature ones, are relatively radioresistant due to low mitotic activity. Nerve (Option C): Nerve cells are highly differentiated and do not undergo cell division, making them radioresistant . Muscle (Option D): Muscle cells are also highly differentiated and have low mitotic activity, making them radioresistant like nerve tissue.

        "B": "Susceptibility weighted image",
        "C": "Gradient echo image",
        "D": "Inversion recovery image"
      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: B) Susceptibility weighted image Explanation: This MRI sequence is highly sensitive to magnetic susceptibility differences between tissues. It exploits differences in the magnetic properties of tissues or substances, such as blood products, calcium, or iron deposition. SWI is particularly useful for detecting microbleeds, haemorrhage, venous malformations, and calcifications. Susceptibility-weighted imaging (SWI) is an advanced MRI technique that enhances the visibility of tissues based on magnetic susceptibility differences. It is highly sensitive for detecting microbleeds (common in hypertension), iron deposits (seen in neurodegenerative diseases and hemorrhagic lesions), and calcifications. Black dots on SWI indicate areas of Microbleeds/Iron deposition/Calcification. CSF appears dark, not bright. Proton density image (option A): This is incorrect because proton density imaging emphasises the number of hydrogen nuclei per tissue volume and is not sensitive to susceptibility differences. Gradient echo image (option C): This is incorrect because while gradient echo sequences are somewhat sensitive to magnetic susceptibility, they lack the resolution and phase-processing techniques of SWI. Inversion recovery image (option D): This is incorrect because inversion recovery sequences are used for suppressing specific tissue signals (e.g., fat or fluid) and are not focused on magnetic susceptibility differences.",

It does not resemble static grey-scale USG images. X-Ray (option C): X-rays are static, high-contrast images displaying bones, air-filled spaces, or dense structures like metal. They do not provide grey-scale differentiation like USG. MRI (option D) produces highly detailed cross-sectional images with various sequences (T1, T2, etc.). It is more advanced than USG, often showing clear demarcation of soft tissues, which is not typical of the image described.",

PSMA stands for Prostate-Specific Membrane Antigen, which is a protein highly expressed on the surface of prostate cancer cells. The PET scan utilizes a radiotracer labeled with Gallium-68 to target and visualize these PSMA proteins, thus providing detailed imaging of prostate cancer. Advancements in Prostate Cancer Diagnosis: Prostate Cancer Statistics : Second most common cancer in men and the sixth leading cause of cancer-related death globally. Early detection leads to a cure rate of over 90%. Role of Molecular Imaging : Essential for individualized diagnosis and treatment of prostate cancer. Utilizes modalities like PET, SPECT, MRI, CT, ultrasound, and bioluminescence for non-invasive cellular and molecular imaging. Limitations of 18F-FDG PET : Not routinely used for early-stage prostate cancer due to its low metabolic activity in prostate cancer cells. Advancement with Ga-68 PSMA Imaging : A groundbreaking tool in nuclear medicine for managing metastatic prostate cancer, gaining global recognition. Ga-68 PSMA PET scan is a highly sensitive imaging modality primarily used for the detection and management of prostate cancer . It utilizes a radiotracer labeled with Gallium-68 that binds to Prostate-Specific Membrane Antigen (PSMA) , which is overexpressed in prostate cancer cells. Lung cancer (Option A): Imaging for lung cancer usually involves CT, PET-CT with FDG, or biopsy for diagnosis. Colon cancer (Option C): FDG PET-CT is used for staging and recurrence detection in colorectal cancer. Liver cancer (Option D): Diagnosis of liver cancer (e.g., HCC) relies on imaging modalities like multiphase CT or MRI; PET-CT may play a secondary role.

      "explanation": "Correct Answer: B) Glucose Explanation: FDG-PET scans use a radiolabeled form of glucose, known as Fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG), to assess glucose metabolism. Fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) positron-emission tomography (PET-FDG) Uptake of 18F-FDG (Analogue of endogenous glucose) in large quantities by cancer cells as compared to normal cells Application: Quantification of tumor metabolic activity Diagnosis (lung cancer) and Staging of cancer Assessing distant metastasis More sensitive in primary lung and oesophageal cancer metastatic disease Assessment of response to treatment A decrease in FDG uptake after chemotherapy indicates that the tumor is responding to treatment Routine surveillance following treatment- not commonly preferred. Not useful in the following situations: High Glycolytic Metabolism tissues: Central nervous system tumors. Inflammation vs. Cancer: Both conditions exhibit increased glucose metabolism. Movement disorders Coronary blood flow Warburg Effect Cancer cells prefer glycolysis over oxidative phosphorylation, even in the presence of oxygen. This leads to increased glucose uptake and lactate production , common in many cancers. 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose (18F-FDG) , a glucose analog used in PET imaging, helps study this effect. Mechanisms of 18F-FDG Accumulation Mechanism Description Aerobic Glycolysis Cancer cells rely heavily on glycolysis, increasing glucose and 18F-FDG uptake, even with oxygen. Transport & Trapping GLUT-1 transporters mediate glucose entry. 18F-FDG is phosphorylated and trapped inside cells. Tumor Heterogeneity Differences in tumor subtype, size, and microvasculature affect 18F-FDG uptake.

      "correct_answer": "D",
      "explanation": "is false. In X-ray imaging, live or healthy bone appears more radiolucent or darker compared to dead or necrotic bone, which appears more radiopaque or lighter. This is because X-rays are absorbed more readily by dense or calcified structures, making necrotic or dead bone appear whiter on X-ray images. Incorrect Options: Option A . Loss of soft tissue planes is the earliest X-ray chance of infection: This statement is true. In cases of infection, such as osteomyelitis or soft tissue infections, X-ray findings may show loss of soft tissue planes. This can be seen as blurred or indistinct soft tissue outlines around affected areas. Option B . Glass pieces can be seen in X-ray images: This statement is true. X-rays are capable of detecting glass pieces or fragments if they are present in the body. Glass is radiopaque, meaning it does not allow X-rays to pass through easily, resulting in a visible appearance on X-ray images. Option C . Joint space is a misnomer as there is no real space in the joint: This statement is false. The joint space refers to the actual space between the articulating surfaces of two bones within a joint. In normal anatomy, the joint space appears as a gap or distance between the bones.

      "explanation": "waveform refers to a waveform pattern that shows a single peak or systolic flow. It indicates impaired or reduced venous blood flow. In the case of lower limb DVT, where a blood clot forms within a deep vein, the affected vein becomes partially or completely obstructed. This obstruction disrupts normal blood flow, resulting in a monophasic waveform as the blood flow is diminished or restricted. Incorrect Options: Option B . Biphasic: A biphasic waveform refers to a waveform pattern that shows two distinct peaks or flow components. It indicates a partial obstruction or alteration in blood flow dynamics. Biphasic waveforms can be observed in various conditions, including venous insufficiency or partial obstruction. However, in the context of lower limb DVT, a biphasic waveform is less commonly seen, as the obstruction is typically more significant and leads to a monophasic waveform. Option C . Triphasic: A triphasic waveform refers to a waveform pattern that exhibits three distinct peaks or flow components. It is typically seen in normal arterial flow and is not characteristic of venous flow. Triphasic waveforms are typically observed in arteries, such as the peripheral arteries, and are associated with normal pulsatile blood flow. Option D . Multiphasic: The term \"multiphasic\" does not specifically describe a characteristic waveform pattern. It generally refers to a waveform that exhibits multiple phases or flow components. In the context of lower limb DVT, the presence of multiple flow components in the Doppler waveform is less likely, as the obstruction caused by the blood clot would generally result in diminished or altered flow patterns, leading to a monophasic waveform.
