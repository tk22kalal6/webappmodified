      "question": "A woman with endometrial carcinoma is undergoing radiotherapy. Which of the following is true?",
      "options": {
        "A": "Intensity is inversely proportional to the square of the distance from the source",
        "B": "Small blood vessels are most radioresistant",
        "C": "Rapidly proliferating cells are most radioresistant",
        "D": "Small intestinal mucosa is most radio-resistant"
      },
      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "source Explanation: The inverse square law defines that the intensity is inversely proportional to the square of the distance from the source. It is a principle of physics that states that the intensity of an effect such as illumination or gravitational force changes in inverse proportion to the square of the distance from the source. Radiotherapy: Radiation is a 'Double-edged sword' - it kills cancerous cells; it may also damage normal cells. It kills cells by damaging DNA which produces free radicals. Types: It depends on the source of radiation. Two types: Teletherapy: EBRT (External Beam Radiotherapy), source is at a distance, Brachytherapy: source is nearer to the patient. Brachytherapy is divided into 3 types: Interstitial (into the tissue): Ca Prostate, Ca Breast Intracavitatory (accessible cavity): Accessible tumors like Ca Cervix Mold (Superficial cancers): Penis, Eye cancers Small blood vessels are most radioresistant (Option B): Small blood vessels are not the most radioresistant. In fact, the vascular endothelium is relatively radiosensitive, and radiation can cause vascular damage leading to ischemia and necrosis. Rapidly proliferating cells are most radioresistant (Option C): Rapidly proliferating cells are not the most radioresistant; in fact, they are more radiosensitive. The reason is that these cells are often in the process of dividing, and radiation damages DNA, disrupting the cell cycle and leading to cell death. Small intestinal mucosa is most radio-resistant (Option D): Small intestinal mucosa is not the most radio-resistant. The cells of the small intestinal mucosa are rapidly dividing, making them more susceptible to radiation. Reference: Inverse-square law - Wikipedia Are cancer stem cells radioresistant? - PMC",

      "question": "What is the cause of the double bleb sign observed during early pregnancy?",
      "options": {
        "A": "Twin pregnancy",
        "B": "Amnion and chorion",
        "C": "Yolk sac and amniotic sac",
        "D": "Heterotopic pregnancy"
      },
      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "yolk sac (first bleb) and the amniotic sac (second bleb) within the gestational sac. This sign is typically observed around 4.5 to 6 weeks of gestation and is considered a marker of a viable intrauterine pregnancy. Early Pregnancy Ultrasound: Ultrasound is the imaging method of choice. In early pregnancy, transvaginal is more sensitive than trans-abdominal. Decidua is first formed as the thick hyperechoic endometrium. Structures visualized Gestational age (TVS) Key features Gestational sac 4.5 to 5 weeks First sign of pregnancy in an ultrasound Yolk sac 5 to 6 weeks First reliable sign of an intrauterine pregnancy. Fetal heartbeat 5.5 to 6 weeks M-mode is preferred for the assessment of cardiac activity. Note: Doppler is contraindicated in 1st trimester, as it can increase the temperature and damage the embryo . First reliable sign of an intrauterine pregnancy is the yolk sac inside the gestational sac. Double decidual sac sign : (Option C) Suggestive of intrauterine pregnancy. (Option A ruled out) Two echogenic rings are seen surrounding the gestational sac, an inner decidua capsularis and an outer decidua parietalis. In between the two decidua is the uterine cavity. Pseudogestational sac is irregular in outline, usually centrally located in the uterus, has no double decidua sign and the sac remains empty. Twin pregnancy (option A): Incorrect because in a twin pregnancy, two separate gestational sacs or two yolk sacs may be visualised, but it does not produce the classic double bleb sign. Amnion and chorion (option B): Incorrect because the double bleb sign does not represent the amnion and chorion. The chorion is the outermost membrane and is not part of the blebs visualised in early gestation. Heterotopic pregnancy (option D): Incorrect because heterotopic pregnancy refers to the coexistence of an intrauterine and an ectopic pregnancy. It does not produce the double bleb sign.",
