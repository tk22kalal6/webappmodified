Radiographic findings show a narrow aganglionic segment with proximal dilatation. Hirschsprung Disease Hirschsprung disease is characterized by the absence of ganglion cells (aganglionosis) in the distal colon and rectum. This condition may result from a failure of neural crest neuroblasts to migrate into bowel segments or the degeneration of already migrated neuroblasts. It impacts both the myenteric and submucosal plexuses. Hirschsprung disease typically presents in term neonates with failure to pass meconium within 1-2 days after birth. About 75% of cases present",

      },
      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: C) String sign of Kantor Explanation: The clinical scenario describes skip lesions , cobblestone appearance, and asymmetric mural thickening with deep ulcers , which are hallmark features of Crohn’s disease . The string sign of Kantor is seen in Crohn’s disease and refers to the beaded, string-like appearance of the bowel due to multifocal narrowing from strictures. Crohn’s Disease Ulcerative Colitis Skip lesions ; ileum and caecum involved; rectum relatively spared. Transmural; leads to ulceration, fissures, abscesses. Bowel wall may be affected asymmetrically with sacculations. Continuous colonic involvement; rectal in 95% of cases. Mucosal and submucosal; less severe. Fissure and abscess are not common. Circumferential bowel wall symmetry is usually maintained. 1. Fluoroscopy (Barium Studies) Mucosal abnormalities: Thickened, nodular folds and a \"cobblestone\" pattern due to a combination of longitudinal and transverse ulcers. Aphthous ulcers: Appear as areas of barium collection within the swollen mucosa. Shows deep ulcers, fistulae (e.g., enteroenteric, enterocolonic), and sinus tracts. Chronic disease features: Strictures, stenosis, and wall sacculations. String sign of Kantor: A beaded string-like appearance due to multifocal bowel narrowing from strictures. 2. Ultrasonography Concentric mural thickening of the bowel wall. Hyperemia within the inflamed segments. Increased echogenicity of surrounding fat. 3. CT and MRI Enterography Asymmetric Mural thickening Ulcerations: Seen as air or contrast extending into the bowel wall. Strictures Mesenteric changes: Comb sign: Engorgement of the vasa recta. Mesenteric fat stranding, edema, and reactive adenopathy. MRI-specific findings: T2 hyperintense signal: Indicates mural edema, best seen with fat-saturated sequences. Diffusion restriction: Suggestive of active inflammation. Active inflammation shows hyperenhancement in arterial and post-contrast phases. 1. Radiographs Bowel perforation and toxic megacolon: Radiographs (upright and supine) help screen for these conditions. Toxic megacolon: Detected by colonic distension >6 cm, typically in the transverse colon. Fig. Toxic megacolon in Ulcerative colitis Other findings: Air-fluid levels, loss of colonic haustrations, mucosal islands, and absence of formed stool. 2. Fluoroscopy (Barium Enema) Mucosal abnormalities: Granular and stippled mucosa, with superficial erosions and ulcers. Collar button ulcers: Deeper ulcers extending into the submucosa. (Option B ruled out) Pseudopolyps Chronic disease features: Lead pipe colon: Luminal narrowing and loss of haustrations in the colon. (Option A & C ruled out) Patulous ileocecal valve (IC valve): With granular terminal ileum, indicative of backwash ileitis. 3. CT and MRI Enterography Active phase: Mural hyperenhancement: Concentric mural thickening with stratification. Submucosal edema: Seen as T2 hyperintensity on MRI. Pseudopolyps Chronic phase: Lead pipe colon: Concentric mural thickening with luminal narrowing and loss of haustrations. Submucosal fat deposition Presacral space widening due to perirectal fat.

        "D": "Cecal Volvulus"
      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: B) Intussusception Explanation: Intussusception occurs when one segment of the bowel telescopes into another, often due to a lead point, such as a lymphoma in this case. The ultrasound findings showing a target sign are classic for intussusception. The patient's symptoms of severe abdominal pain, vomiting, and currant jelly stools further support this diagnosis. Intussusception Intussusception occurs when one segment of the bowel is pulled into another, often leading to bowel obstruction and ischemia. It is a common cause of acute abdomen in children, while in adults, it is typically associated with a focal lesion acting as a lead point. The classic clinical presentation of intussusception in children may include intermittent abdominal pain, vomiting, and a palpable \"sausage-like\" mass in the right upper quadrant, although these symptoms occur in less than 20% of cases. Parents may also report \"currant jelly\" stools , indicating bowel ischemia, and approximately 15% of patients may present without abdominal pain. Plain Radiograph: Elongated soft tissue mass in the upper right quadrant. Bowel obstruction with air-fluid levels and proximal bowel dilation. Possible absence of gas in the distal collapsed bowel. Fluoroscopy: Gold standard is the contrast enema, showing the intussusception as an occluding mass. Characteristic \"coiled spring sign.\" Fig. Coiled spring sign Ultrasound: Target sign (doughnut sign)- Concentric alternating echogenic and hypoechoic bands are observed, where the echogenic bands represent the serosa and submucosa, flanking the hypoechoic muscularis propria. Pseudokidney sign- Longitudinal ultrasound appearance of the intussuscepted segment of bowel which mimics a kidney Crescent in a doughnut sign. Absence of blood flow in the intussusceptum (contraindication for enema). Features favoring ileocolic intussusception: hyperechoic core, thicker outer hypoechoic wall, larger anteroposterior diameter, and presence of lymph nodes. CT Scan: Characteristic \"bowel-within-bowel\" configuration. Concentric rings of bowel on axial images, and sausage-shaped mass on longitudinal images.

The string of pearls sign, which appears as a row of small gas bubbles along the bowel wall, is virtually diagnostic of this condition, particularly in the context of the patient's symptoms. String of Pearls Sign: The string of pearls sign consists of a row of small gas bubbles in the abdomen, typically seen obliquely or horizontally. These gas bubbles are trapped along the superior wall of the small bowel, between the valvulae conniventes. The inferior margins of the bubbles have an ovoid appearance due to the meniscal effect of intraluminal fluid. It can be observed on upright or decubitus abdominal radiographs and on CT scans.

The cupola sign and Rigler’s sign further support the diagnosis, as they reveal free gas and an outline of the bowel wall. Chilaiditi sign represents a pseudo-pneumoperitoneum where the intestine (usually colon) is interposed between the liver and diaphragm, mimicking free air but not representing true pneumoperitoneum. Therefore, it must not be present in this scenario. Fig. Chailaiditi sign Pneumoperitoneum Pneumoperitoneum refers to the presence of free gas in the peritoneal cavity, typically indicating a perforated viscus (e.g., perforated peptic ulcer). Causes: Common: Perforated peptic ulcers, bowel obstruction, inflammatory conditions, ischemia, injury during colonoscopy. Other causes without peritonitis: Postoperative (up to 7 days), peritoneal dialysis, sealed perforation, and tracking from pneumomediastinum.

      "question": "A newborn is diagnosed with an anorectal malformation (imperforate anus) on physical examination. Given the high association with VACTERL anomalies, the medical team decides to conduct a series of radiographic studies to assess for potential associated conditions. Which of the following is a key imaging modality in the evaluation of a neonate with imperforate anus?",
      "options": {
        "A": "Plain abdominal X-ray",
        "B": "Invertogram",
        "C": "Abdominal ultrasound",
        "D": "Distal colostogram"
      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: B) Invertogram Explanation: The invertogram is crucial for assessing the most distal level of the bowel in male patients with imperforate anus, particularly when meconium is present on the perineum without an apparent perineal fistula. Proper positioning is essential for accurate evaluation. Invertogram Used to classify anal atresia in neonates by visualizing the distance between the gas bubble in the terminal colon and the perineal skin. Typically performed 24 hours after birth to allow for small fistulas to become apparent. The newborn is inverted from the lower limbs, with careful positioning to avoid hip and shoulder rotation. Remove any radiopaque items and ensure the X-ray is taken during full inspiration. Can cause discomfort and crying, which may lead to misleading results; a prone cross-table lateral view can be a more comfortable alternative. Invertogram image showing anal atresia Plain abdominal X-ray (Option A): While useful for ruling out esophageal atresia and other anomalies, it does not provide specific information about the anatomy or level of the anorectal malformation. Abdominal ultrasound (Option C): This is important for evaluating hydrocolpos and hydronephrosis in females with cloacal anomalies but does not assess the anorectal malformation itself. Distal colostogram (Option D): This test can evaluate the distal bowel but is typically performed after a colostomy has been created, making it less relevant for initial assessment in a newborn with an imperforate anus.",
