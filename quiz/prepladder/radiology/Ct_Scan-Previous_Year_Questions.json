      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: B) NC-CT Explanation: Non-contrast CT (NC-CT) KUB is the investigation of choice (IOC) for ureteric calculi due to its high sensitivity (>95%) and specificity (>98%) in detecting even small stones. It provides detailed anatomical visualization without requiring contrast, making it the gold standard for urinary calculi evaluation. Radiographic Investigations: X-ray KUB: Detects 90% of calculi (radiopaque). Radiolucent stones (TIXU): Triamterene, Indinavir, Xanthine, Uric acid. Ultrasound (USG): Screening tool for hydronephrosis and stones in the collecting system. Intravenous Pyelogram (IVP): Early films (1 & 5 min): Assesses contrast excretion & obstructions. Delayed films: Identifies the cause of delayed excretion. Non-contrast Spiral CT (NCCT) â€“ Gold Standard: Most sensitive test for renal/ureteric calculi. Retrograde Pyelogram (RGP): Better anatomical delineation, especially for the distal ureter. Helps detect additional stones & coexisting ureteric diseases (e.g., strictures). USG (Option A): First-line for pregnant women and children, but misses small ureteric stones and lacks sensitivity for ureteral evaluation. CE-CT (Contrast-Enhanced CT) (Option C): Contrast can obscure stones, making it less effective for detecting calculi. Ureteroscopy (Option D): Used for diagnosis and treatment, but not the first-line investigation. Reference: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK560674/",
