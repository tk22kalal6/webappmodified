Purpose Scan types For Myocardial Perfusion Assess ischemia Cold spot: decreased uptake in ischemic areas. Thallium scan (Commonly used) Tetrofosmin Sestamibi scan. For Myocardial Infarction (Option B ruled out) Assess infarct Hot spot in infarct area as pyrophosphate accumulates and is not metabolized. 99m Tc - Pyrophosphate scan. For Ventricular Function (Option C ruled out) Evaluate ejection fraction MUGA (Multiple Gated Acquisition) scan (AKA nuclear ventriculography) Radiolabeled RBCs are used Most accurate for ventricular function - Cardiac MRI For Myocardial Viability (Option D ruled out) Assess the viability of myocardium PETscan - Best investigation for myocardial viability. Perfusion and metabolism mismatch are observed in the PET scan. Perfusion Agents :N-13 ammonia and Rubidium chloride. Metabolism Agent : FDG-PET is used for glucose metabolism. No FDG uptake indicates a normal heart or an infarct. FDG uptake is present: In the Ischemic Myocardium FDG-PET is combined with perfusion imaging for comprehensive assessment. Uptake in PET with low perfusion indicates reversible dysfunction (suggestive of hibernation ). Irreversible dysfunction indicates the presence of scar tissue . Note: Hibernating myocardium is ischemic but viable.",

      "explanation": "γ -H2AX foci indicating unrepaired DNA damage γ -H2AX foci indicating unrepaired DNA damage Explanation: High levels of γ -H2AX foci suggest inefficient DNA repair mechanisms, which is associated with increased radiosensitivity, as the cells struggle to repair radiation-induced damage. Intrinsic Radiosensitivity: Sensitive vs. Resistant Tumors Intrinsic radiosensitivity refers to a tumor's natural ability to respond to radiation, which varies between and within tumors. This variability impacts the effectiveness of radiotherapy. Key Insights on Radiosensitivity Tumor Type Variations Radiosensitivity differs widely across tumor types and even among the same tumor cells. A study on 27 canine cancer cell lines showed survival fractions (SF2) ranging from 0.19 to 0.93, indicating that factors beyond tumor type, like cellular traits, influence radiosensitivity. Cellular Factors Influencing Radiosensitivity DNA Repair Efficiency Tumors with poor DNA double-strand break (DSB) repair mechanisms, indicated by high residual γ -H2AX foci, are more radiosensitive. (Option A ruled out) Apoptosis Rates Tumors with higher rates of apoptosis (e.g., lymphoid tumors) respond better to radiation. (Option B ruled out) Tumor Microenvironment Tumors with lower radiosensitivity scores often have higher immune activation, suggesting a more immune-active environment can improve radiation response. Intra-Tumor Heterogeneity Different cell types within a tumor show varying radiosensitivity, with cancer stem cells (CSCs) being more resistant (Option D ruled out) , compared to ordinary cancer cells (OCCs), leading to recurrence after radiotherapy.

This results in increased glucose uptake and lactate production , a hallmark of many tumors. Warburg Effect Cancer cells prefer glycolysis over oxidative phosphorylation, even in the presence of oxygen. This leads to increased glucose uptake and lactate production , common in many cancers. 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose (18F-FDG) , a glucose analog used in PET imaging, helps study this effect. Mechanisms of 18F-FDG Accumulation Mechanism Description Aerobic Glycolysis Cancer cells rely heavily on glycolysis, increasing glucose and 18F-FDG uptake, even with oxygen. Transport & Trapping GLUT-1 transporters mediate glucose entry. 18F-FDG is phosphorylated and trapped inside cells. Tumor Heterogeneity Differences in tumor subtype, size, and microvasculature affect 18F-FDG uptake. Clinical Implications of 18F-FDG Implication Details Prognostic Indicator Higher 18F-FDG uptake correlates with worse prognosis (e.g., shorter DFS in invasive ductal carcinoma). Reverse Warburg Effect Cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) increase glycolysis in tumor cells via metabolic coupling. Treatment Monitoring PET imaging tracks changes in 18F-FDG uptake, reflecting therapy responses targeting glycolysis or mitochondria. Cancer cells prefer oxidative phosphorylation under anaerobic conditions (Option A): Oxidative phosphorylation is suppressed, not preferred, in cancer cells.

On sulfur colloid scans, hemangiomas usually show normal or slightly reduced tracer uptake but not a complete defect, because they do not significantly alter the reticuloendothelial system. They are usually not associated with chronic hepatitis B, making this diagnosis less likely in this patient. Focal nodular hyperplasia (Option C): It is a focal overgrowth of functioning liver tissue (contains Kupffer cells and hepatocytes) supported by fibrous stroma. Shows normal or even increased uptake on a sulfur colloid scan. It is not associated with chronic hepatitis B, making it an unlikely diagnosis in this case. Hepatic cyst (Option D): It is a benign fluid-filled lesion that does not uptake tracer on a sulfur colloid scan, similar to the defect seen in this case. Cysts are usually asymptomatic and not typically associated with chronic hepatitis B. Hence, it is an unlikely diagnosis in this case.

      "explanation": "Correct Answer: B) Acute cholecystitis Explanation: The image shown is a HIDA scan. In acute cholecystitis, the gallbladder fails to fill with the radiotracer due to obstruction of the cystic duct as seen in the image, often caused by a gallstone or edema in the cystic duct. HIDA scan (Hepatobiliary iminodiacetic acid scan) Nuclear imaging test to evaluate the function of the liver, gallbladder, bile ducts, and small intestine. Technetium-99m (99mTc)-labeled derivatives of iminodiacetic acid is used. Mechanism: Radiotracer follows the bilirubin metabolic pathway (excreted into the bile). This will allow visualization of the biliary tree, gallbladder, and bowel. Application: Disease/Diagnosis Findings Acute cholecystitis (Option B) Non-visualisation of the gallbladder Hot rim sign- inflammation around the gallbladder Chronic cholecystitis (Option A ruled out) Visualization is reduced or delayed (due to contracted gallbladder) Gallbladder dyskinesia (Option D ruled out) Low gallbladder ejection fraction Others Bile leaks Biliary obstruction (patency of the intra- and extrahepatic biliary system) Patency of a bilioenteric anastomosis.

Radiopharmaceutical Injection A radioactive tracer (e.g. iminodiacetic acid) is injected through IV. This tracer is taken up by the liver and biliary tract. 2. Gamma Ray Detection As the tracer moves from the liver to the gallbladder and then to the duodenum, it emits gamma rays, which are detected by a gamma camera. 3. Image Creation The gamma camera is moved over the abdomen to capture images, allowing visualization of the liver, gallbladder, and biliary tract, revealing their structure and function. Prompt excretion into the bile ducts (Option B) : This finding is consistent with a normal scan.
