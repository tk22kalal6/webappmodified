The “1-2-3” pattern refers to bilateral hilar and right paratracheal lymphadenopathy. Sarcoidosis Sarcoidosis is a multisystem inflammatory disorder characterized by the formation of noncaseating granulomas, with an unknown cause. Staging of Sarcoidosis Stage 0 No visible abnormalities Stage 1 Hilar/mediastinal lymphadenopathy without lung parenchymal changes (Option B) Stage 2 Hilar/mediastinal lymphadenopathy with lung disease (Option C) Stage 3 Diffuse lung disease without lymphadenopathy (Option D) Stage 4 End-stage fibrosis (Option A) Nodal Abnormalities : Found in up to 90% of patients, typically involving hilar and mediastinal lymph nodes. Common CXR findings include: Symmetric mediastinal and hilar lymphadenopathy. \"1–2–3\" pattern (Garland sign) : Right paratracheal, right hilar, and left hilar enlargement. \"1–2–3–4\" pattern: Includes enlarged aortopulmonary lymph nodes. The egg shell calcification is seen late in the disease Scintigraphy: The Gallium-67 scan shows: Panda sign: It indicates bilateral involvement of the parotid and lacrimal glands, along with normal uptake in the nasopharyngeal mucosa. Lambda sign: This condition usually affects bilateral hilar and right paratracheal lymph nodes, which can form a shape similar to the Greek letter lambda ( λ ). Classical HRCT Findings: Well-defined, smooth or irregular nodules (2-4 mm) in a perilymphatic distribution, primarily in the upper lobes. Nodules may cluster or coalesce into larger formations.A large pulmonary nodule made up of several smaller nodules and encircled by numerous tiny satellite nodules is referred to as the \"galaxy sign.” Bilateral hilar and mediastinal lymph node enlargement.

      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "Correct answer: A) MRI of the chest Explanation: MRI is the preferred imaging modality for posterior mediastinal masses, particularly those suspected to arise from neural structures. It provides excellent soft tissue contrast and allows detailed visualization of the mass and its relationship with surrounding tissues, making it ideal for evaluating neurogenic tumors. Felson classification of the mediastinum: Felson classification divides the mediastinum into three anatomical compartments to assist in the localization and diagnosis of mediastinal masses. These compartments are based on lateral chest radiographs. Compartment Boundaries Common Masses/Abnormalities Anterior (Prevascular) Posterior sternum to anterior heart and great vessels Thymic masses: Thymoma, thymic hyperplasia, thymic carcinoma Germ cell tumors: Teratoma Thyroid masses: Ectopic thyroid, substernal goiter Lymphoma: Hodgkin's, non-Hodgkin's Middle (Visceral) Between anterior and posterior compartments Contains heart, great vessels, trachea, esophagus, lymph nodes Bronchogenic cysts Pericardial cysts Lymphadenopathy (metastasis, lymphoma, sarcoidosis) Aortic aneurysms, vascular abnormalities Posterior (Paravertebral) Posterior heart and great vessels to anterior vertebrae Neurogenic tumors: Schwannomas, neurofibromas, ganglioneuromas Esophageal lesions: Tumors, diverticula Spinal abnormalities : Vertebral infections, hernias, masses",

      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: B) MRI Explanation: The clinical features of Horner's syndrome (ptosis, miosis, anhidrosis) combined with brachial plexopathy (arm weakness, pain, and numbness) strongly suggest a Pancoast tumor, which is a lung apex tumor often affecting the sympathetic chain and brachial plexus. MRI is the preferred imaging modality as it provides detailed visualization of soft tissues, including the tumor’s invasion into surrounding structures like the brachial plexus. CT Scan (Computed Tomography): Modality of choice for the detailed evaluation of lung tumors. PET-CT (Positron Emission Tomography-CT): Modality of choice for staging and assessing metastatic spread , as malignant cells show increased glucose metabolism. Combines metabolic imaging (via PET) with anatomic detail (via CT). MRI (Magnetic Resonance Imaging): Not routinely used for lung tumors, but valuable in specific cases. Superior sulcus tumors (Pancoast tumors): Investigation of choice in pancoast tumors to assess brachial plexus involvement or spinal cord invasion. Chest X-ray (Option A): Incorrect — suggests the presence of mass but does not define nerve or soft tissue invasion. CT Scan (Option C): Incorrect — good for bony detail but not optimal for brachial plexus or sympathetic chain evaluation. PET Scan (Option D): Incorrect — useful for staging , not for assessing local neurological invasion .",

      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: A) Round atelectasis causing a distinct pattern of lung collapse. Explanation: Round atelectasis occurs when lung tissue collapses, resulting in the characteristic comet tail sign on CT due to the distinct radiographic appearance. Asbestosis Asbestosis is a chronic lung disease caused by the inhalation of asbestos fibers, primarily affecting workers in occupations such as plumbing, shipbuilding, and construction. It is classified as an occupational lung disease, characterized by progressive pulmonary fibrosis and pleural abnormalities. It affects lower lobes predominantly. Radiological Signs: Sign/Condition Features Pleural Plaques Holly Leaf Sign: Calcified pleural plaques, exhibiting irregular, thickened nodular edges that resemble the shape of a holly leaf. Mesothelioma Radiological Feature: Irregular thickening of the pleura, often involving the mediastinal pleura, leading to fibrothorax/ frozen. Comet Tail Sign (Crow's Feet Sign) Mechanism: Localized atelectasis with adjacent blood vessels and bronchi drawn towards the collapsed area. Appearance: Rounded",

Usual Interstitial Pneumonia (UIP) Non-Specific Interstitial Pneumonia (NSIP) (Option A) It presents as a mainly subpleural bibasal reticular pattern with areas of honeycomb (subpleural cystic airspaces with discrete, thickened walls that are stacked or lined up in a row) destruction. As the disease advances, it tends to spread along the lung periphery , affecting the anterior parts of the upper lobes , referred to as the 'propeller blade distribution.' There are signs of traction bronchiectasis and bronchiolectasis. Ground-glass opacities are not predominant. Bilateral ground-glass opacities accompanied by fine reticular patterns . Primarily peripheral in distribution , but may also appear patchy or band-like. Minimal or absent honeycomb pattern. Presence of traction bronchiectasis and bronchiolectasis. Subpleural sparing is seen. Cryptogenic organizing pneumonia (Option C) Opacities may appear consolidative, ground-glass, nodular, or mass-like. Typical distribution is subpleural or peribronchovascular. A common appearance is the perilobular pattern, which features linear or band-like opacities arranged in an arcade or polygonal shape . The “atoll” or “reversed halo sign ” is characterized by central ground-glass opacity with a surrounding consolidative edge. Sarcoidosis generally features bilateral hilar lymphadenopathy with egg shell calcification of hilar lymph nodes and ground-glass opacities. (Option D)",

Primary Tuberculosis: Pathology: Characterized by macrophage infiltration, monocytes, and inflammatory fluid in peripheral pneumonia. Spread to regional nodes and bodies occurs within 2 to 6 weeks. Chest X-ray: Homogeneous lobar consolidation (any lobe), often indistinguishable from other bacterial pneumonia. Lymphadenopathy is the most common manifestation. Ghon lesion or focus: Well-defined rounded or irregular (linear) opacity with or without calcification. Ranke complex: Combination of Ghon lesion and ipsilateral lymph node calcification. Reactivation and Reinfection of Tuberculosis Most cases result from reactivation of quiescent lesions, occasionally from new infections. Pathologically, the host's immune response leads to increased inflammatory response and caseous necrosis.

      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Correct answer: B) It may be mistaken for a lung mass due to its appearance. Explanation: Chest X-ray reveals a well-defined homogeneous mass occupying the transverse fissure in the right middle lung field in a patient with heart failure, suggesting a diagnosis of a phantom tumor , which may be mistaken for a lung mass due to its mass-like radiologic appearance. Phantom Tumor/ Vanishing Tumor: A phantom tumor is a well-demarcated opacity resulting from pleural effusion. It is commonly associated with congestive heart failure. The effusion is typically transudative in nature. (Option D) The most commonly described appearance is a well-defined homogeneous mass, occupying the transverse fissure or sometimes the oblique interlobar fissures. (Option A) It may be mistaken for a lung mass or consolidation because of its radiologic appearance as a mass-like configuration in the lung. (Option B) It vanishes following mobilization of the fluid and effective diuresis. (Option C) Mostly seen in the geriatric population who have a higher incidence of congestive heart failure. Pathophysiology: In congestive heart failure, increased hydrostatic pressure on the right side of the lung interferes with venous and lymphatic drainage. This leads to a predominance of effusion on the right side. Pleuritis can cause obliteration of the pleural space, preventing the spread of fluid. Treatment: Diuretics",

      "explanation": "Correct answer: C) Pleural effusion Explanation: Clinical features like breathlessness, cough, and decreased breath sound, along with X-ray findings of large pleural opacity and blunted costophrenic angle, indicate a diagnosis of Pleural effusion. Pleural Effusion: Pleural effusion is the accumulation of fluid in the pleural space. Effusion Progression: Blunting of costophrenic angles starts at 200-500 mL. Classic signs include opacification of the lower chest with a concave superior margin. Massive Effusions: 1000 mL reaches the fourth anterior rib; cause dense opacification of the hemithorax with contralateral mediastinal shift. Diaphragmatic inversion may occur. Lateral decubitus X-rays: Increase sensitivity for small effusions as the pleural fluid moves with gravity and the lung effectively floats on the effusion. Subpulmonary Effusions: Appear as a \"high hemidiaphragm\" on x-rays, with an unusual contour that peaks laterally than usual. Ultrasound or CT confirms the diagnosis. In an upright PA view, the meniscus sign indicates the presence of a significant amount of pleural fluid, typically exceeding 200 mL and blunting the costophrenic angle.

Pathophysiology: The pressure gradient in the thorax changes with pneumothorax. Normally, the pleural space is negative compared to atmospheric pressure. If air enters the pleural space through communication with the alveoli, it alters the pressure gradient, leading to lung collapse. Radiographic appearance of pneumothorax: Pneumothorax appears as a radiolucent area (black). Pneumothorax pushes the adjacent lung towards the hilum. A sharp radiopaque line separates the pneumothorax from the lung parenchyma. A closed pneumothorax is easily detectable in an expiratory X-ray, as there is a decrease in lung volume. However, the volume of the pneumothorax is not affected",

Focusing on area B allows for optimal visualization of structures such as the pulmonary arteries, veins, and lymph nodes, which are critical in identifying potential pathologies like tumors, infections, or vascular changes. Area B is best suited for assessing any abnormalities that may indicate underlying disease in the hilar region.

Oblique fissure: Separates the middle from the lower lobe, and also divides the upper from the lower lobe. Fissures: Oblique (major) fissure: Separates the upper from the lower lobe. Clinical Relevance: Right Middle Lobe (RML) Collapse: Seen as a wedge-shaped opacity overlying the heart on lateral X-ray. Lobar Pneumonia: Fissures localize consolidation (e.g., obscured right heart border in RML pneumonia). Pleural Effusion: Blunts fissures due to fluid accumulation. Elevated Hemidiaphragm Flat Hemidiaphragm One side of the diaphragm appears higher than normal. The normally dome-shaped diaphragm appears flattened and lower in position. Causes: Subphrenic Abscess: Pus beneath diaphragm. Hepatomegaly/Splenomegaly: Enlarged organs push the diaphragm upward. Diaphragmatic Palsy : Paralysis due to phrenic nerve injury. Lung Collapse/Fibrosis : Loss of lung volume elevates the diaphragm. Atelectasis: Collapsed lung leads to diaphragm elevation. Causes: COPD: Hyperinflated lungs cause a flat diaphragm and tubular heart appearance. Tension Pneumothorax: Air pushes the diaphragm downward.

      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: B) Expiration Chest X-ray In expiration, the lung becomes white due to air exhaled out while pneumothorax remains black. So, white lung gives a good contrast to black pneumothorax in expiration. Chest X-ray: Inspiration vs. Expiration Chest X-ray in Inspiration: Chest X-rays are typically performed during the inspiration phase, which maximizes lung volume and provides a clearer view of the lung fields. During this phase, the lungs fill with air, and the air appears black on the X-ray due to its low density compared to surrounding tissues. Chest X-ray in Expiration: Expiratory chest X-rays are utilized for assessing small pneumothoraces and suspected inhaled foreign bodies, while inspiratory chest X-rays are performed in all other cases. Appearance During Expiration: When a foreign body obstructs the airway, air may become trapped in the lungs, preventing full exhalation. Consequently, during an expiratory X-ray, the obstructed lung appears black (due to retained air), indicating an obstruction on that particular side. A persistent black appearance in the affected lung can confirm an obstruction. Comparison of Normal Lung and Pneumothorax: Pneumothorax (inspiratory and expiratory x-rays).

Inspiration Chest X-ray (Option A): Commonly used for general chest imaging but can miss small pneumothoraces since the lungs are fully expanded, hiding air in the pleural space. Lateral Decubitus Chest X-ray (Option C): Most sensitive chest x-ray view for pleural effusion. Oblique Chest X-ray (Option D): This view can be helpful for evaluating certain thoracic structures but is not typically used to assess pneumothorax.",
