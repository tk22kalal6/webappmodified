      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: A) V Explanation: Segment V : The segment highlighted in red is segment V , which is a part of the liver . In liver segmental anatomy, segment V corresponds to the anterior inferior segment of the right lobe . This segment is situated near the right hepatic vein and is typically visualized on imaging studies like CT or MRI scans. IVa (option B) : Incorrect because segment IVa is part of the left lobe of the liver, specifically the anteromedial portion. It is not located in the area highlighted in red in the image. VII (option C) : Incorrect because segment VII is located in the posterior part of the right lobe of the liver, typically near the right hepatic vein but further back compared to segment V. III (option D) : Incorrect because segment III is part of the left lobe of the liver and located in the posterior part of the left lobe, closer to the left hepatic vein , which does not match the highlighted segment.

        "A": "Hepatocellular carcinoma",
        "B": "Fibronodular hyperplasia",
        "C": "Liver abscess",
        "D": "Hydatid cyst"
      },
      "correct_answer": "D",
      "explanation": "a hydatid cyst caused by Echinococcus granulosus . The calcification indicates a chronic or resolved infection, typical in the late stage of a hydatid cyst. Hydatid cyst is caused by infection with Echinococcus granulosus or Echinococcus multilocularis . The disease progresses through stages: cyst formation, growth, and eventual calcification. On a non-contrast CT scan , calcified hydatid cysts appear as well-defined, round or oval lesions with peripheral or complete calcification. This calcification signifies a chronic or inactive cyst. The cyst's \"water lily sign\" or \"daughter cysts\" (when present) are specific features but are better visualised on other imaging modalities. In endemic areas, calcified hydatid cysts are diagnostic of previous or resolved hydatid disease. WHO Classification of Hydatid Cysts (Cystic Echinococcosis): The WHO classification is based on ultrasound findings, helping in diagnosing and managing cystic echinococcosis. WHO Classification Gharbi classification Classification Description Imaging Stage Classification CE1 Unilocular anechoic lesion with a 'double line' sign. Active Type I CE2 Cyst with multiple septations, resembling a honeycomb. Active Type III CE3a Unilocular cyst with detached membranes and 'water-lily' sign. Transitional Type II CE3b Cyst with daughter cysts in a solid matrix. Transitional Type III CE4 Heterogeneous echogenicity, no daughter cysts indicating degeneration. Inactive Type IV CE5 Calcified cyst, indicating inactivity. Inactive Type V Imaging: Ultrasound: Primary modality for evaluating hydatid cysts. Identifies key features like floating membranes and daughter cysts. CT and MRI: Used for detecting complications (e.g., cyst rupture, infection).",

      "question": "Please identify the structure labelled 'X' in the given ultrasound image of the liver.",
      "options": {
        "A": "Portal vein",
        "B": "Hepatic artery",
        "C": "Hepatic vein",
        "D": "Inferior vena cava"
      },
      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "tubular structure running through the liver tissue. It can be visualized as a hypoechoic (darker) tube with a characteristic branching pattern. The portal vein plays a crucial role in delivering nutrients and substances absorbed from the digestive system to the liver for processing and detoxification. Hepatic Artery (Option B): The hepatic artery is a blood vessel that supplies oxygenated blood to the liver. In an ultrasound of the liver, the hepatic artery may be visualized as a smaller, pulsatile vessel alongside the portal vein. It appears as a hyperechoic (brighter) tube with a pulsating motion. The hepatic artery delivers oxygenated blood to the liver cells for their metabolic needs. Hepatic Vein (Option C): The hepatic veins are blood vessels that drain deoxygenated blood from the liver and carry it back to the heart via the inferior vena cava. In an ultrasound of the liver, the hepatic veins can be seen as hypoechoic (darker) tubular structures that converge and eventually merge into a single vessel known as the main hepatic vein. The hepatic veins drain blood from the liver and play a role in the liver's excretory function. Inferior Vena Cava (Option B): The inferior vena cava (IVC) is a large vein that receives deoxygenated blood from the lower body and carries it to the right atrium of the heart. In an ultrasound of the liver, the IVC is typically visualized as a larger, hypoechoic (darker) vessel located posterior to the liver. It can be observed entering the liver at the level of the main hepatic vein. The IVC acts as the final drainage pathway for blood leaving the liver through the hepatic veins.",

      },
      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "woman on oral contraceptives is most likely indicative of a hepatocellular adenoma, which is associated with oral contraceptive use. The CT scan image may show a well-defined mass in the liver with characteristic features of hepatocellular adenoma. Incorrect Options; Option A: Hepatocellular carcinoma- The given CT scan image showing a hepatocellular adenoma is not consistent with the appearance of hepatocellular carcinoma. Option B: Metastatic infiltrates- Metastatic infiltrates refer to the spread of cancer cells from another primary site to the liver. While metastatic liver lesions can occur in individuals with a history of cancer, the given CT scan image showing a hepatocellular adenoma is not consistent with metastatic infiltrates. Option D: Hemangioma- Hemangiomas are benign tumors that consist of abnormal blood vessels. They are the most common benign liver tumors and are typically asymptomatic. Hemangiomas can be incidentally found on imaging studies such as CT scans. However, the given CT scan image showing a hepatocellular adenoma is not consistent with the appearance of a hemangioma.

It is one of the major branches of the abdominal aorta and supplies blood to the small intestine, part of the large intestine, and other abdominal structures. Red arrow marks left renal vein.
