      "explanation": "Anomalous Pulmonary Venous Connection (PAPVC) A congenital anomaly where one or more but not all pulmonary veins drain into the right atrium or systemic venous circulation instead of the left atrium. This leads to a left-to-right shunt, causing volume overload on the right side of the heart and pulmonary circulation. Most common variant - the left upper pulmonary vein draining into the right atrium. Other variants drain into SVC, coronary sinus, IVC, or azygos veins. The chest X-ray typically shows mild cardiomegaly, right atrial and ventricular enlargement, and increased pulmonary vasculature , especially in the right lung field. Scimitar syndrome - When a part or whole of the right lung is drained by anomalous pulmonary veins that connect to IVC, leading to hypoplastic right lung. Chest X-ray shows anomalous vein parallel to right heart border mimicking Turkish sword (Scimitar). Although VSD (Option B) also causes a left-to-right shunt, the characteristic murmur is a holosystolic murmur best heard at the left lower sternal border, and chest X-ray findings typically show biventricular enlargement. Mitral Stenosis (Option C) usually presents with left atrial enlargement on X-ray and features like pulmonary venous congestion.

      "explanation": "pulmonary artery artery Explanation: The clinical presentation and imaging findings are highly suggestive of Transposition of the Great Arteries (TGA), specifically D-loop TGA . In TGA, the great vessels (aorta and pulmonary artery) run parallel to each other, with the aorta positioned anterior and slightly to the right of the pulmonary artery. This arrangement is due to the ventriculoarterial discordance characteristic of TGA. Key points supporting the diagnosis of D-Loop TGA in this case: Early presentation with marked central cyanosis without respiratory distress History of maternal diabetes (associated risk factor) Chest X-ray showing cardiomegaly with an \"egg on a string\" appearance Echocardiographic finding of parallel great vessels with abnormal positioning D-Loop TGA ( dextro-transposition of the great arteries) L-Loop TGA (Congenitally Corrected) Pathology The aorta originates from the right ventricle and the pulmonary trunk from the left ventricle, creating two parallel circulatory circuits. This condition is life-threatening unless a shunt, like a patent ductus arteriosus (PDA) or septal defect, is present to allow blood mixing. Congenitally corrected TGA (ccTGA) is characterized by both atrioventricular and ventriculoarterial discordance, a condition referred to as \"double discordance.\" X-ray Cardiomegaly \"Egg on a string\" appearance Narrow mediastinum Increased pulmonary vascular markings Mesocardia or levocardia Straight left heart border Abnormally straight vascular pedicle Possible bulge along upper left cardiac border Ventricular septal defect with overriding aorta is characteristic of Tetralogy of Fallot, not TGA (Option A) .

      "explanation": "Correct Answer: C) Widened Mediastinum Explanation: The patient is experiencing acute respiratory distress likely due to non-cardiogenic pulmonary edema (NCPE) as a result of a severe allergic reaction. Conditions like Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS) can occur in response to allergens, leading to increased permeability of the alveolar-capillary barrier and resulting in pulmonary edema. Widened Mediastinum is NOT characteristic of pulmonary edema. A widened mediastinum is usually indicative of conditions such as aortic dissection, large mediastinal tumors, or significant vascular issues, rather than pulmonary edema. Non-Cardiogenic Pulmonary Edema: Caused by increased permeability of the alveolar-capillary barrier (not due to heart failure). Common Cause: Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS).

        "D": "Carotid Intima-Media Thickness"
      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: B) Agatston Score Explanation: The Agatston Score is used to assess coronary artery disease (CAD) risk by quantifying the amount of coronary artery calcification seen on a CT scan. Higher scores indicate a higher burden of coronary atherosclerosis and increased cardiovascular risk. Coronary Atherosclerosis Coronary atherosclerosis is the buildup of plaques in the coronary arteries, leading to reduced blood flow and increasing the risk of cardiovascular events. Agatston Score Purpose: The Agatston score quantifies coronary artery calcium (CAC) detected via computed tomography (CT). It helps assess the risk of coronary artery disease (CAD). Calculation: The score is derived from the density and area of calcified plaques in the coronary arteries. Higher scores indicate a greater burden of coronary calcification and a higher risk of coronary events. Coronary calcium lesion = CT density of 130 Hounsfield units with area >1mm2. Interpretation: 0: No identifiable calcium, low risk of coronary events. 1-99: Mild coronary calcium, moderate risk. 100-399: Moderate to high risk. ≥ 400: High risk, indicating significant atherosclerotic burden. CHA2DS2-VASc Score (Option A) is used to assess the risk of stroke in patients with atrial fibrillation, not CAD risk. Reynolds Risk Score (Option C) is a tool used to predict cardiovascular risk, but it incorporates more factors such as high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP) and is not specifically for coronary artery calcification. Carotid Intima-Media Thickness (CIMT) (Option D) is not specific to coronary artery disease risk as it measures the thickness of the carotid artery walls, not coronary artery calcification or plaque burden.",
