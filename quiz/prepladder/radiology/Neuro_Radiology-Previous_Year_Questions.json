      "options": {
        "A": "Subarachnoid hemorrhage",
        "B": "Subdural hemorrhage",
        "C": "Cerebral venous thrombosis",
        "D": "Intraparenchymal hemorrhage"
      },
      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: C) Cerebral venous thrombosis Explanation: The empty delta sign is a radiological finding seen on contrast-enhanced CT scans or MR venography. It indicates the presence of a thrombus in the dural venous sinus, most commonly the superior sagittal sinus. The thrombus appears as a filling defect surrounded by contrast enhancement, forming a triangular or delta-shaped void. Central venous sinus thrombosis CVT should be suspected in patients presenting with headaches, seizures, or encephalopathy. Can occur in superficial or deep dural venous sinuses, affecting either isolated veins or as part of broader venous sinus thrombosis. Factors like intracranial infections , trauma, dehydration, pregnancy , oral contraceptives , smoking, and vasculitis (e.g., Beh√ßet disease) can trigger CVT. If absent, a thrombophilia screening is necessary. CT Findings : The empty delta sign , visible in contrast-enhanced CT scans, indicates dural venous sinus thrombosis in the superior sagittal sinus as a triangular filling defect outlined by contrast, representing a thrombus. The dense vein sign , a hyperdense vessel sign indicating hyperattenuating thrombus due to acute venous thrombosis, is found in cortical veins or dural venous sinuses . MRI Findings : Loss of normal flow void; thrombosed vessels may appear hyperintense on T1 and T2 sequences. Very acute thrombus can be hypointense on T2, mimicking flow voids. Additionally, slow flow can also result in loss of the flow void. MR venography (MRV) shows a loss of flow signal or irregularity, indicating a thrombus. SWI (Susceptibility Weighted Imaging) can highlight thrombosed veins and detect acute hemorrhage. Subarachnoid hemorrhage (Option A): Typically presents with hyperdense blood in the basal cisterns or sulci on non-contrast CT, not an empty delta sign. Subdural hemorrhage (Option B): Appears as a crescent-shaped hyperdensity along the brain's surface, unrelated to the venous sinuses. Intraparenchymal hemorrhage (Option D): Appears as a hyperdense lesion within the brain parenchyma on non-contrast CT and is not associated with the empty delta sign",

      "question": "Which imaging technique is preferred for diagnosing primary hyperparathyroidism in a woman who presented with confusion, constipation, and headache, and has elevated serum calcium (13.1 mg/dL) and ALP levels?",
      "options": {
        "A": "MRI",
        "B": "FDG PET",
        "C": "CT",
        "D": "Sestamibi scan"
      },
      "correct_answer": "D",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: D) Sestamibi scan Explanation: This is the preferred imaging technique for diagnosing primary hyperparathyroidism , especially when the patient is suspected to have a parathyroid adenoma or hyperplasia. The sestamibi scan uses a radiotracer that is taken up by the parathyroid glands, particularly in the presence of adenomas or hyperplasia. It is highly sensitive and specific for detecting parathyroid pathology. Elevated calcium levels and ALP, along with the clinical symptoms, suggest primary hyperparathyroidism, making a sestamibi scan the most appropriate next step. Radiological features of Primary Hyperparathyroidism: Features Image Subperiosteal erosions and terminal resorption in the phalanges (usually starts in the middle phalanx of the index finger's radial side) along with bone demineralisation. The \"salt and pepper\" appearance, or pepper pot skull (lytic lesions in the skull). Brown tumour or osteitis fibrosa cystica: Cystic lesions in bone from excessive osteoclastic resorption appear as low-density, multiloculated cysts that can lead to bone expansion, accompanied by bleeding and granulation tissue. Sestamibi scan (Tc-99): Localize the tumour . MRI (option A): This is not typically used for the initial diagnosis of primary hyperparathyroidism. MRI may be used for further evaluation if other imaging modalities are inconclusive. FDG PET (option B): This is primarily used for oncology, such as detecting malignancies or metastases, and is not routinely used for diagnosing primary hyperparathyroidism. CT (option C): CT can be used in some cases to localize parathyroid adenomas, but it is less sensitive than a sestamibi scan and is not the first-line imaging modality for primary hyperparathyroidism.",

      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: B) Neurocysticercosis Explanation: The radiological findings and MR spectroscopy results (increased choline, alanine, and lactate ) are consistent with neurocysticercosis (NCC) , which is caused by Taenia solium. Radiological Features: Cystic lesions with or without ring enhancement Scolex (dot sign) seen within the cyst in vesicular stage Perilesional edema due to inflammatory response Calcifications in the nodular-calcified stage MR Spectroscopy Findings: Increased choline (due to membrane turnover) Elevated alanine & lactate (suggestive of anaerobic metabolism seen in parasitic infections) These findings strongly indicate neurocysticercosis as the probable diagnosis. Neurocysticercosis NCC is the most common parasitic CNS infection worldwide, caused by the ingestion of Taenia solium eggs.
