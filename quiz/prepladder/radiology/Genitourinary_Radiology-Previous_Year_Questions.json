Putty kidney is seen in advanced renal tuberculosis , where extensive calcification and atrophy lead to a non-functioning kidney. Calcifications in the Kidney: Description Staghorn Calculus Putty Kidney (Option A) Medullary Nephrocalcinosis Description Large, branching stone filling the renal pelvis and calyces, resembling the shape of a staghorn. Tissue damage in the kidney by TB leads to dystrophic calcification. Indicates end-stage renal TB. Calcium deposition within the renal medulla (inner kidney). Cause Struvite stones formed from magnesium ammonium phosphate due to infection with urease-producing bacteria (e.g., Klebsiella, Proteus) Renal tuberculosis leads to granuloma formation causing necrosis, cavitation, fibrosis and stricture formation. Metabolic disturbances (e.g., hyperparathyroidism, sarcoidosis, renal tubular acidosis, medullary sponge kidney disease) leading to calcification of the renal medulla",

      },
      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: A) MRI of Polycystic Kidney Disease Explanation: Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) is a preferred modality for diagnosing Polycystic Kidney Disease (PKD) due to its superior soft tissue contrast and ability to visualize multiple cysts without ionizing radiation . Imaging of Polycystic Kidney Disease (PKD) Imaging Modality Findings Indications Ultrasound (USG) Enlarged kidneys, multiple cysts First-line screening in suspected PKD CT Scan Multiple cysts, hemorrhage, infection Detects complications like rupture or infection MRI High-resolution imaging of cysts, no radiation Preferred for assessing renal function and disease progression MRI is particularly useful in young patients and those requiring long-term follow-up . Autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD). Familial disorder with autosomal dominant inheritance , classified as a ciliopathy . Kidneys are progressively replaced by multiple cysts in the cortex and medulla, with initial preservation of intervening parenchyma. ADPKD is typically diagnosed between ages 30 and 50 , when symptoms first appear, thus being named \"adult PKD”. Typically presents in adults with hematuria , hypertension , and renal failure . It is associated with other conditions namely intracranial aneurysms, heart valve dysfunctions, colonic diverticula, aortic dissection and cystic lesions in other organs like the liver, spleen and pancreas. Imaging Plain Radiograph Enlarged, multilobulated renal outlines with bowel displacement. Multiple calcifications, sometimes with multiple ring appearance. Intravenous urography : \"Swiss cheese nephrogram\" (due to multiple renal cysts), \"Spiderleg pyelogram\" (stretched pelvicalyceal system). Ultrasound Simple cysts: Anechoic with thin walls, posterior acoustic enhancement, and lateral shadowing. Complicated cysts (haemorrhage/infection): Echogenic material within the cyst, possible wall calcification, absence of internal blood flow. CEUS : Demonstrates",

        "C": "Bladder tumor",
        "D": "Posterior urethral valve"
      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: B) Ureterocoele Explanation: Ureterocoele is a congenital abnormality where the lower end of the ureter balloons out and forms a cyst-like structure. In an IVP, ureterocoele can be seen as a filling defect or a dilated portion of the ureter. It may cause obstruction to urine flow and can be associated with hydronephrosis. Ureterocele USG showing cystic pouching at left and right ureteral orifices Bilateral “Cobra head” appearance of distal ureters on X-ray Intravenous Urography Horseshoe Kidney (Option A) is a congenital condition in which the lower poles of both kidneys are fused together, forming a U-shaped structure. In an Intravenous Pyelogram (IVP), horseshoe kidney may be visualized as a single mass or \"horseshoe-shaped\" structure in the midline of the abdomen. Bladder Tumor (Option C): Bladder tumors refer to abnormal growths of tissue in the bladder, which may be benign or malignant (cancerous). In an IVP, bladder tumors can appear as filling defects or irregularities within the bladder. These abnormalities may cause partial or complete obstruction of the bladder outlet, and the IVP can help identify the location, size, and extent of the tumor. Posterior Urethral Valve (Option D) is a congenital abnormality that occurs in male infants where there is an abnormal fold of tissue in the urethra, obstructing urine flow. In an IVP, the posterior urethral valve may manifest as dilatation of the urethra and the urinary bladder. The IVP can demonstrate the extent of the obstruction, any associated hydronephrosis, and the impact on the urinary tract.",

      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "bacterial infection of the kidney characterized by gas formation within the renal parenchyma and surrounding tissues. It is more common in patients with diabetes and is associated with high mortality. The patient's presentation of chills, rigors, acute right flank pain and the presence of gas within the renal parenchyma on imaging are highly indicative of emphysematous pyelonephritis. Incorrect options: Option A, C and D are incorrect. Refer to the explanation of correct answer.",
