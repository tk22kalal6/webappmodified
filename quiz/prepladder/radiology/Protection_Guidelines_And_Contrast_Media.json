      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "emerging primarily in the 5-20 Gy range. It is characterised by severe nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea, indicating serious gastrointestinal distress from radiation exposure. Acute Radiation Syndrome (ARS): It refers to symptoms following whole-body or significant partial-body exposure to high doses of radiation (>1 Gy). LD50/60, or Lethal Dose 50/60 , is the radiation dose expected to cause death in 50% of the exposed population within 60 days. An LD50/60 of approximately 4.5 Gy indicates that this level of whole-body radiation can lead to 50% mortality without medical intervention. Clinical Phases of ARS: Phase Time Post-Exposure Symptoms/Outcomes Prodromal Phase 0–2 days Nausea, vomiting, anorexia, fever, headache, early skin erythema (suggesting significant exposure >2 Gy ) Latent Phase 2–20 days Temporary symptom improvement; abnormal lab results (lymphopenia, granulocytopenia) despite feeling well Manifest Illness Phase 21–60 days Symptoms vary by syndrome: Hematopoietic syndrome ( 1-8 Gy , death in months): Gastrointestinal syndrome ( >5 Gy , death in 2 weeks) Neurovascular syndrome ( >20 Gy , death within 48 hours) Final Phase Recovery or Death The outcome depends on the absorbed dose, dose rate, and exposure heterogeneity.

      "explanation": "does not align with the ALARA Principle. ALARA (As Low As Reasonably Achievable) Principle: It serves as a guiding framework for minimising radiation exposure during diagnostic and interventional procedures. Its core application is to reduce radiation exposure while maintaining the quality of medical procedures. Strategies for reducing radiation exposure: Increase distance (Option A ruled out) : According to the inverse square law, radiation exposure decreases significantly with increased distance from the source. Use shielding (Option C ruled out) : Employ physical barriers to block radiation, such as personal protective equipment (PPE) like lead aprons and thyroid collars, along with architectural shielding in facilities (e.g., concrete walls in X-ray rooms). Reduce time (Option D) : Minimizing the duration of exposure during procedures is crucial, as shorter exposure times directly reduce the risk for both patients and healthcare workers.

It states that radiological examinations of the lower abdomen and pelvis should be conducted, whenever possible, within the first 10 days following the onset of menstruation unless pregnancy is excluded. In early pregnancy, radiation exposure, especially during organogenesis (weeks 3-8 post-conception), can lead to teratogenic effects (e.g., congenital anomalies), increased risk of miscarriage, or even fetal growth restriction. This rule helps to prevent radiation exposure during early pregnancy that can potentially harm the developing embryo. Reference: DC Dutta’s Textbook of Obstetrics, 9th Edition, Page 606",

      "correct_answer": "D",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: D) Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) exacerbation Barium contrast study is contraindicated in Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) exacerbation ( acute inflammation) as it poses a risk of perforation, where barium can leak into the abdominal cavity, leading to peritonitis and severe complications. Barium contrast is a water-insoluble substance used in imaging studies to enhance the visualization of the GI tract, aiding in the assessment of conditions like gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), esophageal strictures, tumors, diverticulosis, ulcers and motility disorders. Contraindications of Barium Study: GI Perforation : Can lead to peritonitis or mediastinitis. Bowel Obstruction : May exacerbate the obstruction and increase the risk of perforation. Tracheoesophageal Fistula : Risk of aspiration leading to pneumonia; iso-osmolar or low-osmolar non-ionic contrast is preferred. Acute Abdominal Inflammation : Risk of perforation and severe complications. Types of Barium Studies Type Conditions Barium Swallow To evaluate normal swallowing function.

      "correct_answer": "D",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: D) Sulfur Hexafluoride microbubbles In contrast-enhanced ultrasound (CEUS), microbubbles or microspheres , such as those found in Sonovist and Levovist , contain sulfur hexafluoride gas encapsulated in a phospholipid shell. These microbubbles improve the visualization of blood flow and enhance the imaging of vascular structures and lesions. Another type of microbubble in CEUS consists of octafluoropropane gas within a phospholipid shell. Contrast agents for USG Examples Sonovue (sulfur hexafluoride) Lumason (sulfur hexafluoride) Definity (perflutren) Sonozoid (perflubutane) Preferred route Intravenous Eliminated by Lungs (hence safe in Renal conditions) Indications Liver lesions Micturating cystosonography Renal lesions Obstruction in Crohn's disease Evaluation of Aortic aneurysm repair Adverse Effects It is the safest contrast media and rarely causes mild anaphylactoid reactions. Barium sulfate (Option A) is the most commonly used contrast agent for identifying gastrointestinal tract issues such as ulcers, tumours, strictures, or inflammation. It is not water-soluble and is given orally or rectally. Iodinated contrast agents (Option B) are water-soluble and are widely used for X-rays, CT scans, and interventional radiology. However, they are highly nephrotoxic and should be used with caution in patients with renal impairment only after evaluating renal function. Saline solution (Option C) enhances the visualisation of internal structures, such as in saline infusion sonohysterography and hysterosalpingo-contrast sonography, which is mixed with air to improve the visibility of fallopian tubes and identify peritoneal spills.
