      "correct_answer": "D",
      "explanation": "standard for detecting fetal anemia, especially in cases of Rh isoimmunization or parvovirus B19 infection . Principle: In fetal anemia, the blood viscosity decreases , leading to increased blood flow velocity in the MCA due to compensatory mechanisms. Doppler ultrasound measurement: MCA-PSV is measured using Doppler ultrasonography and compared with MoM (multiples of the median) values to determine anemia severity. Assessment of Fetal Anemia Method Utility Invasiveness MCA-PSV Doppler (Correct Answer) Gold standard for non-invasive detection of fetal anemia Non-invasive Umbilical artery Doppler Assesses placental insufficiency (not fetal anemia) Non-invasive Cord blood sampling (PUBS - Percutaneous Umbilical Blood Sampling) Directly measures fetal hemoglobin and hematocrit but has high risk of complications Invasive Chorionic villus sampling (CVS) Used for genetic testing in the first trimester, not fetal anemia Invasive Umbilical artery Doppler (Option A) is incorrect because it primarily assesses placental insufficiency and fetal hypoxia rather than fetal anaemia. Cord blood sampling (Option B) is incorrect because, although it provides direct measurement of fetal haemoglobin, it is invasive and associated with procedure-related risks. Chorionic villus sampling (Option C) is incorrect because it is used for early genetic testing, not for evaluating fetal anaemia.

        "A": "Omphalocele",
        "B": "Spina bifida",
        "C": "Anencephaly",
        "D": "Encephalocele"
      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: B) Spina bifida Explanation: The Banana sign is a term used in ultrasound (USG) to describe a specific appearance seen in spina bifida , a neural tube defect. It is characterized by the shape of the cerebellum , which appears curved or banana-shaped due to caudal displacement of the cerebellum and tethering of the spinal cord . This sign is typically seen in fetal ultrasound and is a key indicator of spina bifida, particularly in cases of myelomeningocele , a type of open spina bifida. Neural Tube Defects: Condition Description Spina Bifida (Myelomeningocele) The cerebellum appears flattened and curled at the base, creating a \"banana\" shape due to tethering of the spinal cord. A lemon sign indicates a flattened frontal bone often seen in spina bifida. Omphalocele Abdominal organs protrude through the umbilical cord, covered by a membrane. Anencephaly The brain and skull fail to develop fully, leading to severe neural tube defects. Absence of the brain , with partial or total lack of the skull. Encephalocele Brain tissue protrudes through a skull defect, forming a sac-like structure. Omphalocele (Option A) : This is a defect of the abdominal wall and does not show the banana sign. Anencephaly (Option C) : This condition involves the absence of the brain and skull and is not associated with the banana sign. Encephalocele (Option D) : This involves a protrusion of brain tissue through an opening in the skull, and does not show the banana sign.",

      "question": "Which of the following is not a benefit of ultrasound (USG) compared to mammography?",
      "options": {
        "A": "USG can be used to detect calcifications, asymmetries, and distortions better than mammography",
        "B": "Can be used for guided biopsy",
        "C": "In young females with dense breasts",
        "D": "Can be used to differentiate solid VS cystic"
      },
      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "than mammography Correct Answer: A) USG can be used to detect calcifications, asymmetries, and distortions better than mammography. Explanation: Mammography is superior to USG in detecting microcalcifications, architectural distortions, and asymmetries , which are key features of early breast malignancies . Ultrasound is not effective in detecting tiny microcalcifications (seen in DCIS) because it relies on sound waves rather than X-rays . Mammography remains the gold standard for breast cancer screening, especially in women >40 years . Comparison of USG vs. Mammography Feature Ultrasound (USG) Mammography Microcalcifications detection Poor Excellent Architectural distortion Poor Good Best for dense breasts Yes (young females) Limited sensitivity Solid vs. cystic differentiation Excellent Poor Guided biopsy Yes Yes (stereotactic) Radiation exposure None Yes (low dose) Can be used for guided biopsy (Option B) : Ultrasound is excellent for guided biopsies , as it provides real-time imaging, allowing accurate needle placement for tissue sampling. In young females with dense breasts (Option C) : Ultrasound is particularly useful in young women with dense breasts because mammography may not clearly differentiate between benign and malignant masses in dense tissue, whereas ultrasound can. Can be used to differentiate solid vs cystic (Option D) : Ultrasound is effective in distinguishing between solid tumors and fluid-filled cysts , which helps avoid unnecessary biopsies in cystic cases.

        "B": "Bicornuate uterus",
        "C": "Unicornuate uterus",
        "D": "Septate uterus"
      },
      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "diagnosis is option C, \"Unicornuate uterus.\" The image demonstrates a single uterine cavity without evidence of a double uterus, bicornuate uterus, or septate uterus. A unicornuate uterus is a condition in which only one half of the uterus develops properly, while the other half fails to develop or is very small. It results from the incomplete development of one Müllerian duct. Incorrect Options: Option A: Uterus didelphys- Uterus didelphys, also known as a double uterus, is a condition in which there are two separate uterine cavities, each with its own cervix. It occurs due to incomplete fusion of the Müllerian ducts during embryonic development. Option B: Bicornuate uterus- Bicornuate uterus is a condition characterized by a uterus that has a heart-shaped or two-horned appearance. I Option D: Septate uterus- Septate uterus is a condition characterized by the presence of a uterine septum, which is a band of tissue dividing the uterine cavity into two separate cavities.

      "explanation": "showing bilateral hydrosalpinx, which indicates tubal blockage and the accumulation of fluid in the fallopian tubes. It is a radiologic procedure used to evaluate the anatomy of the uterus and fallopian tubes. During HSG, a contrast medium is injected into the uterine cavity, and X-ray images are taken to assess the shape, size, and patency of the fallopian tubes. Incorrect Options: Option A: Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI)- Magnetic Resonance Imaging is a diagnostic imaging technique that uses strong magnetic fields and radio waves to produce detailed images of the body's internal structures. Option B: Positron Emission Tomography (PET)- Positron Emission Tomography is a nuclear medicine imaging technique that uses a radioactive tracer to visualize metabolic and physiological processes in the body. It is not typically used for the evaluation of tubal patency or the diagnosis of hydrosalpinx. Option D: Laparoscopic chromopertubation- Laparoscopic chromopertubation is a surgical procedure performed under anesthesia to assess tubal patency. It involves the direct visualization of the pelvic organs using a laparoscope and the injection of a dye into the uterus to evaluate the spillage of dye through the fallopian tubes. Reference: .",
