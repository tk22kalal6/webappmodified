      "explanation": "Correct Answer: A) Coarctation of aorta Explanation: The presence of the Figure of 3 sign and rib notching on X-ray, along with symptoms of hypertension and chest pain, indicates coarctation of the aorta . These findings suggest narrowed aorta leading to collateral circulation and rib erosion, confirming the diagnosis. Figure of 3 sign: This sign indicates a contour abnormality of the aorta commonly associated with coarctation of the aorta.",

      },
      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "heart\" (coeur en sabot) seen on a chest radiograph is a classic finding in TOF. It occurs due to: Right ventricular hypertrophy (RVH), which causes the apex of the heart to lift upward. Pulmonary artery hypoplasia or stenosis, which accentuates the shape. TOF is the most common cyanotic congenital heart defect, characterised by the four features: Pulmonary stenosis Right ventricular hypertrophy Ventricular septal defect (VSD) Overriding aorta Chest X-ray Imaging in TOF: The classic finding on a chest X-ray for TOF is the “boot-shaped” heart (also known as coeur en sabot ), caused by right ventricular hypertrophy leading to an upward tilt of the cardiac apex. There is often a concave main pulmonary artery and decreased pulmonary vascular markings , reflecting the reduced blood flow through the pulmonary arteries due to the RVOT obstruction. Some patients may also present with a right-sided aortic arch , which can be identified on the X-ray. Ebstein’s anomaly (option B): This is incorrect because the radiographic finding in Ebstein’s anomaly is an enlarged, \"box-shaped\" heart due to massive right atrial enlargement, not a boot shape. Transposition of great arteries (TGA) (option C): This is incorrect because TGA typically shows an \"egg-on-string\" appearance on chest X-ray, with a narrow mediastinum. Total anomalous pulmonary venous return (TAPVC) (option D): This is incorrect because TAPVC commonly shows a \"snowman\" or \"figure-of-eight\" sign due to dilated veins and a vertical vein, not a boot-shaped heart.",

        "C": "Metastasis",
        "D": "Fungal ball"
      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: B) Pulmonary Hamartoma Explanation: Popcorn calcification is a characteristic finding on imaging, particularly CT scans , seen in pulmonary hamartomas . These are benign tumors of the lung, typically composed of cartilage, fat, and connective tissue. The calcifications often appear as popcorn-like due to the presence of calcified nodules or cystic components within the tumor. Pulmonary hamartoma Hamartomas are the most common benign lung tumors, Generally asymptomatic and often discovered incidentally Radiographic Features: Typically present as a solitary peripheral pulmonary nodule or mass. Size usually ranges from 1 to 4 cm. Well-circumscribed, round or oval shape with smooth or lobulated margins. Internal calcifications, often with a \"popcorn\" appearance CT scans effectively reveal internal fat , which is pathognomonic for hamartomas. Hamartomas may be multiple, grow slowly, and do not cavitate or invade adjacent structures. Hodgkin’s lymphoma (Option A): Incorrect because Hodgkin’s lymphoma may cause mediastinal masses but does not exhibit popcorn calcifications typically. Calcifications in lymphoma are more uniform and fine. Metastasis (Option C): Incorrect because metastatic lesions usually present as irregular nodules with variable densities. They do not typically show popcorn-like calcifications. Fungal Ball (Option D): Incorrect because fungal balls can calcify, but these calcifications are not typically of the popcorn type . They are more likely to appear as heterogeneous or mottled calcifications.

      },
      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: C) Right Middle Lobe Explanation: On a chest X-ray , the right cardiac border is formed by the right atrium . The silhouette sign helps localize pathology: Obliteration of the right cardiac border occurs when a lesion in the right middle lobe is present, as the lobe lies adjacent to the right atrium. The loss of normal heart-lung interface suggests consolidation, atelectasis, or mass in the right middle lobe . Lobar Localization: Lateral radiograph: Right and left upper lobe bronchi can be seen as two circular radiolucent areas with the right above the left. PA view of the chest: Can locate any structure in the superoinferior dimension as well as the mediolateral dimension. Silhouette sign: Locate any structure in the posteroanterior dimension. Left Lung: Only has an oblique fissure, separating the left upper (LUL) and lower (LLL) lobes. Right Lung: Oblique and horizontal fissures separate the right lung's 3 lobes. Oblique fissure divides the RML and RLL. Horizontal fissure divides the RUL and RML. Silhouette Sign: Absence of the depiction of an anatomic soft-tissue border. Produced by an intrathoracic abnormality that touches the borders of the heart or aorta and obliterates those borders on the frontal chest radiograph. The sign actually refers to the absence of a silhouette. Silhouette sign helps localize airspace opacities, atelectasis, or masses in the lung.

      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: A) Aortic dissection Explanation: The given CT shows an intimal tear in the aorta indicating an Aortic dissection. Aortic Dissection It occurs when a defect or a flap occurs in the aorta, resulting in blood tracking into aortic tissues, splitting the medial layer and creating a false lumen. Clinical features: Sudden onset of severe, tearing chest, radiating to the interscapular region Renal pain and renal failure Paraplegia Syncope Weakness Hypotension or shock Investigations: If the patient is stable, CT angiography is the standard investigation of choice. In the case of unstable patients (SBP<100 mm of HG, HR>100 bpm), the preferred investigation of choice will be TEE (TransEsophageal Echocardiography) MRI can also be done if CT is unequivocal. Chest x-ray reveals widening of mediastinum along with left-sided pleural effusion. Signs of FALSE LUMEN: Cobweb Sign: Irregularities of False lumen Beak Sign: False lumen forms acute angle with True lumen: Pulmonary embolism (Option B): Filling Defect seen in Pulmonary artery IOC for PE: CT Angiography Cardiac Myxoma (Option C): Low annotating hypodense lesion on the posterior most chamber of the heart (Left Atrium) MC primary Benign cardiac tumor in adults. Aortic aneurysm (Option D): Involve either ascending aorta, thoracic aorta & abdominal aorta Represents localized dilation of the aorta; while an aneurysm may predispose to dissection, an intimal tear specifically indicates dissection.

      },
      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: A) MUGA Explanation: Ejection fraction (EF) is a critical parameter for differentiating heart failure with preserved EF (HFpEF) from heart failure with reduced EF (HFrEF). MUGA scan is a non-invasive nuclear imaging test that accurately calculates EF by analyzing the motion of the heart's ventricles using a radioactive tracer and a gamma camera. Purpose Scan types For Myocardial Perfusion Assess ischemia Cold spot: decreased uptake in ischemic areas. Thallium scan (Commonly used) (Option B) Tetrofosmin Sestamibi scan (Option D) For Myocardial Infarction Assess infarct Hot spot in infarct area as pyrophosphate accumulates and is not metabolized. 99m Tc - Pyrophosphate scan. For Ventricular Function Evaluate ejection fraction MUGA (Multiple Gated Acquisition) scan (AKA nuclear ventriculography) Radiolabeled RBCs are used Most accurate for ventricular function - Cardiac MRI For Myocardial Viability Assess the viability of myocardium PETscan - Best investigation for myocardial viability. (Option C) Perfusion and metabolism mismatch are observed in the PET scan. Perfusion Agents :N-13 ammonia and Rubidium chloride. Metabolism Agent : FDG-PET is used for glucose metabolism. No FDG uptake indicates a normal heart or an infarct. FDG uptake is present: In the Ischemic Myocardium FDG-PET is combined with perfusion imaging for comprehensive assessment. Uptake in PET with low perfusion indicates reversible dysfunction (suggestive of hibernation ). Irreversible dysfunction indicates the presence of scar tissue . Note: Hibernating myocardium is ischemic but viable. Myocardial Viability",

        "D": "Lobar consolidation is typical of COVID-19"
      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: B) CORADS-5 is typical of COVID- 19 Explanation: The COVID-19 Reporting and Data System (CORADS) is a standardized system for assessing the probability of COVID-19 pneumonia based on CT findings. CORADS-5 indicates a very high level of suspicion for COVID-19 , with features such as bilateral ground-glass opacities, crazy paving patterns, and subpleural involvement—typical imaging findings in COVID-19 pneumonia. CO-RADS (COVID-19 Reporting and Data System): Aspect Details Purpose Categorical assessment of chest CT scans for suspected COVID-19 cases Scale CO-RADS 1 (very low suspicion) to CO-RADS 5 (very high suspicion) Interobserver Agreement Moderate to substantial agreement among radiologists Discriminatory Power High accuracy in diagnosing COVID-19 Utility & Reliability Effective and standardized reporting tool CO-RADS-AI AI-based tool that automates CO-RADS scoring and CT severity assessment Accuracy Effective in high-prevalence areas Combination with Other Findings AUC value of 0.89 when used with RT-PCR and clinical findings CORADS-0 indicates normal lung (option A): This is incorrect because CORADS-0 is used when the scan is technically insufficient or of poor quality, and not for a normal lung.\\ Pleural thickening is typical of COVID-19 (option C): This is incorrect because pleural thickening is not a typical finding in COVID-19 pneumonia; it is more common in chronic lung diseases or other infections. Lobar consolidation is typical of COVID-19 (option D): This is incorrect because lobar consolidation is more typical of bacterial pneumonia, whereas COVID-19 pneumonia usually shows patchy ground-glass opacities and consolidation.

      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "sudden-onset breathlessness strongly suggests spontaneous pneumothorax , which is commonly seen in Marfan syndrome due to underlying connective tissue defects. Radiological Features (Chest X-ray): Absent lung markings in the affected area Hyperlucency due to air accumulation Collapsed lung margin Mediastinal shift (in tension pneumothorax) The classic association of Marfan syndrome with spontaneous pneumothorax makes this the most likely diagnosis. Spontaneous Pneumothorax Spontaneous pneumothorax occurs when air enters the pleural space without trauma. It is classified into: Type Features Primary No underlying lung disease, seen in tall, thin males (e.g., Marfan syndrome) Secondary Occurs in patients with underlying lung disease (e.g., COPD, tuberculosis) Tension Pneumothorax Air trapping leads to mediastinal shift , requiring emergency intervention Diagnosis: Confirmed by chest X-ray or CT scan .

      },
      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: A) TAPVC Explanation: Plethoric lung fields are seen on chest X-ray when there is increased pulmonary blood flow. In TAPVC, pulmonary veins connect abnormally to the systemic venous circulation instead of the left atrium. This results in mixing of oxygenated and deoxygenated blood, leading to increased pulmonary blood flow and congestion. Total Anomalous Pulmonary Venous Connection (TAPVC) Pathology Pulmonary veins drain into the right atrium directly or indirectly via an abnormal venous connection Not a ductal-dependent cyanotic lesion Sites of venous connection Supracardiac- superior vena cava (Most common) Cardiac-coronary sinus, right atrium Infracardiac Mixed Clinical presentation Cyanosis and congestive cardiac failure With ASD- wide and split S2 Chest X-ray Snowman or figure-8 configuration in supracardiac TAPVC Treatment Surgery No indication for prostaglandins (Not a ductal-dependent cyanotic lesion) Incorrect Options: Tricuspid atresia (Option B): is a congenital heart defect where the tricuspid valve is completely closed or absent. It leads to cyanosis and reduced pulmonary blood flow, which is typically associated with diminished pulmonary vascular markings rather than plethoric lung fields. Ebstein anomaly (Option C): is a rare congenital heart defect characterized by abnormal tricuspid valve anatomy. It results in a displacement of the tricuspid valve leaflets into the right ventricle, causing right atrial enlargement. Plethoric lung fields are not a characteristic radiological finding associated with this condition. TOF (Tetralogy of Fallot) (Option D): TOF is a congenital heart defect characterized by four specific abnormalities in the heart's structure. It includes a ventricular septal defect, pulmonary stenosis, overriding aorta, and right ventricular hypertrophy. While TOF can result in a right-to-left shunt and cyanosis, it typically leads to reduced pulmonary blood flow and diminished pulmonary vascular markings rather than plethoric lung fields.",

      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer B- Exudative pleural effusion Explanation: Based on the description provided, the X-ray findings include obliteration of the costophrenic angle (CP angle) and an upward concave curve on the left side of the lung. These findings are suggestive of a pleural effusion. Pleural Effusion: Pleural effusion is the accumulation of fluid in the pleural space. Small Pleural Fluid: Often undetectable on PA chest x-rays; ultrasound or CT can detect small subpulmonary effusions. Effusion Progression: Blunting of costophrenic angles starts at 200-500 mL. Classic signs include opacification of the lower chest with a concave superior margin. Massive Effusions: 1000 mL reaches the fourth anterior rib; cause dense opacification of the hemithorax with contralateral mediastinal shift. Diaphragmatic inversion may occur. Lateral decubitus X-rays: Increase sensitivity for small effusions as the pleural fluid moves with gravity and the lung effectively floats on the effusion. Subpulmonary Effusions: Appear as a \"high hemidiaphragm\" on x-rays, with an unusual contour that peaks laterally than usual. Ultrasound or CT confirms the diagnosis. In an upright PA view, the meniscus sign indicates the presence of a significant amount of pleural fluid, typically exceeding 200 mL and blunting the costophrenic angle. Loculated (encysted, encapsulated) pleural fluid: Fluid can loculate between visceral pleural layers in fissures or between visceral and parietal layers, often against the chest wall. Commonly results from adhesions. Xray shows D sign. Consolidation (Option A): This would show more distinct lung tissue involvement with air bronchograms and possible increased density, but it wouldn’t obliterate the costophrenic angle as seen in pleural effusion.",

      },
      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer A- Seashore sign Explanation: The Seashore sign is an M ultrasound sign where pleural and structures above appear as horizontal echogenic (bright) lines, while the underlying lung shows a grainy or sandy texture, which represents lung sliding. This is commonly seen in normal lungs with adequate ventilation, differentiating lung sliding from pneumothorax where lung sliding is absent. Sea-shore sign: On M-mode images, lung sliding manifests as the sea-shore sign, where the pleura and structures above appear as horizontal echogenic lines . The underlying lung presents a grainy or sandy texture. The stratified appearance above the pleural line is due to the motionless chest wall , resembling sea waves , while below the pleural line, the lung movement creates a sandy pattern , akin to the shore . Barcode/stratosphere sign: (Option B, C) In cases where lung sliding is absent , M-mode images show uniform horizontal straight lines known as the stratosphere sign or barcode sign. The lack of a grainy or sandy appearance in these images indicates the absence of motion . The stratosphere sign suggests that pneumothorax may be a likely cause. Lung point sign: The border between the sliding lung and pneumothorax is referred to as the \"lung point\" sign. This sign can assist in estimating the size of the pneumothorax . It is important to note that the lung point is only observable if part of the lung is still in contact with the chest wall . The lung point sign is not present in large pneumothoraces . Deep sulcus sign (Option D): An X-ray sign where the costophrenic angle appears deepened in pneumothorax",

Miliary tuberculosis (TB): Severe and disseminated form of tuberculosis (TB), a condition arising from Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection. Results from hematogenous spread of the infection. It can occur in both primary and post-primary pulmonary TB (PTB). Clinically significant miliary TB affects 1% to 7% of all TB cases. Initial chest X-ray (CXR) may appear normal; hyperinflation can be the earliest sign. Typical radiographic findings: Small, discrete nodules measuring 1-2 mm in diameter, distributed evenly throughout both lungs. Tree-in-bud nodules are poorly defined and have a patchy distribution. Chest CT: More sensitive than radiographs and reveals a random distribution of miliary nodules. These nodules may enlarge and coalesce, forming focal or diffuse consolidation. They resolve slowly over 2-6 months with adequate treatment, typically without causing scarring or calcification. Miliary nodules signify active infection and are associated with a poor prognosis. Lung cancer (Option A): Typically presents as a solitary nodule or mass, not diffuse tiny nodules. ARDS (Option C): This would show bilateral diffuse alveolar infiltrates, not miliary nodules. Aspergilloma (Option D): Usually seen as a solid mass (fungus ball) in a pre-existing cavity, not diffuse nodules. A radiologic finding is the air crescent sign , a crescent-shaped radiolucency representing air surrounding the fungus ball within the cavity.",

      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: B) 3rd rib posterior part Explanation: 3rd rib posterior part : The posterior part of the rib is typically identified by its position relative to the spine and the more horizontal orientation in an X-ray, especially when taken from a lateral view. The posterior part of the rib will be closer to the vertebrae and typically appears more curved and parallel to the spine on the X-ray. The highlighted structure in the image is consistent with this description, which is why the 3rd rib posterior part is the correct answer. 3rd rib anterior part (option A) : Incorrect because the anterior part of the 3rd rib would be closer to the sternum, with a more forward and downward orientation on an X-ray. The posterior part is more visible in this case. 4th rib anterior part (option C) : Incorrect because the 4th rib would be located further down than the 3rd rib, and its anterior part would be closer to the sternum. This option doesn't match the positioning seen in the image. 1st rib anterior part (option D) : Incorrect because the 1st rib is positioned more superiorly, closer to the clavicle.

      },
      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: C) Pneumomediastinum Explanation: Pneumomediastinum : Hamman sign is a characteristic physical finding heard on auscultation. It is described as a crunching sound or synchronous clicking sound with the heartbeat, often heard in the precordial area . It is typically associated with pneumomediastinum , where air is present in the mediastinal space, often due to esophageal rupture or trauma. The air in the mediastinum creates a distinctive sound when it moves with the heartbeats, producing the Hamman sign. Pneumomediastinum: Presence of free air around mediastinal structures. Common Causes: Blunt or penetrating trauma. Esophageal perforation. Recent interventions in the esophageal or tracheobronchial tree. Pulmonary infections. Gas-forming infections in the mediastinum. Cocaine inhalation. Extension of air from a pneumothorax. Hamman's crunch sign: Unusual, adventitious sound heard on auscultation of the chest. Radiographic Signs: Ring around the artery sign: Air around the pulmonary artery (usually the right) outlining the artery. Sail sign: Elevation of the thymus caused by air. Continuous diaphragm sign: Air trapped posterior to the pericardium, appearing as a continuous air collection on an AP projection Tubular artery sign: Air outlines the medial side of major aortic branches, with aerated lung outlining the lateral side. Double bronchial wall sign: Air adjacent to the bronchus highlights the bronchial wall. Naclerio V-sign: V-shaped air lucency in the left lower mediastinal area. Pneumoperitoneum (option A) : Incorrect because pneumoperitoneum refers to air in the peritoneal cavity , usually caused by gastrointestinal perforation. It does not typically produce the Hamman sign. Instead, it is more commonly detected through radiological imaging (e.g., abdominal X-ray) showing air under the diaphragm. Pneumopericardium (option B) : Incorrect because pneumopericardium is the presence of air in the pericardial sac around the heart, which may lead to cardiac tamponade . While it can cause a clinical presentation of chest pain or dyspnoea, it is not typically associated with the Hamman sign. Hydropneumothorax (option D) : Incorrect because hydropneumothorax refers to the accumulation of both air and fluid in the pleural cavity , commonly due to trauma or infection. While it may cause dyspnoea and chest pain , it does not produce the characteristic Hamman sign.",

        "D": "Aspiration pneumonia is more common in the posterior segment of the upper lobes and superior"
      },
      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: A) Patchy infiltrates are seen in pyogenic pneumonia Explanation: The most common cause of community-acquired pyogenic pneumonia is Streptococcus pneumoniae (pneumococcus). The most common imaging pattern seen on a chest X-ray for pneumococcal pneumonia is lobar consolidation; meaning a homogeneous consolidation affecting one or more lobes of the lung Patchy infiltrates are not typical for pyogenic pneumonia caused by Streptococcus pneumoniae. Classification of Pneumonia Based on Imaging Pattern: Lobar Pneumonia: Unifocal consolidation, most commonly caused by Streptococcus pneumoniae . In children under 8 years, may appear as “Round Pneumonia” with ill-defined margins. Air bronchograms are common due to patent airways and minimal volume loss. Bronchopneumonia (Lobular Pneumonia): Multifocal distribution, centered around distal airways. Heterogeneous scattered opacities along airway course, coalescing in severe cases. Air bronchogram absent due to airway involvement. Atypical Pneumonia: Features distinct from lobar or bronchopneumonia (discussed in the table below). Causative Agent Specific Imaging Features Streptococcus pneumoniae Most common cause of community-acquired lobar pneumonia in adults. Staphylococcus aureus Common in debilitated patients / superinfection in influenza / secondary to IV drug abuse. Cavitation common in later radiographs. Pneumatoceles (seen in children during recovery phase). Klebsiella pneumoniae Occurs in elderly and alcoholics, usually involves the right upper lobe (RUL). Bulging of fissures due to increased involved lung volume. Legionnaire’s disease (Legionella pneumophila) Rapidly spreading pneumonia from contaminated water sources (ACs, coolers, showers). Also presents with diarrhea, mental confusion (hyponatremia), and shock. Actinomycosis Can mimic bronchogenic carcinoma. Soft tissue/bone involvement (periostitis) – key differentiating feature. CT: Peripheral homogeneous consolidation with central low attenuation and pleural thickening (diagnostic feature). Atypical pneumonia (Most common cause: Mycoplasma pneumoniae) Atypical organism (lacks cell walls, resistant to penicillins). Fine reticular/nodular shadows in perihilar region early, which may progress to consolidation (rare lobar involvement). WBC count usually normal. Presents with non-productive cough, absent/minimal sputum. Not aspiration-related. Common in poorly maintained air-conditioned areas. Other viral causes: Influenza A & B, RSV, Adenovirus, Chlamydia psittaci, Coxiella burnetii (Q fever). Varicella pneumonia Predominantly nodular opacities (5–10 mm). If persistent, may calcify, leading to miliary shadows on CXR. Interstitial infiltrates are seen in Mycoplasma pneumonia (Option B): Mycoplasma pneumonia typically causes atypical pneumonia , with interstitial infiltrates rather than lobar consolidation. Hilar lymphadenopathy with lung infiltrates is seen in malignancy (Option C): Lung cancer, especially small cell carcinoma and lymphoma , commonly presents with hilar lymphadenopathy along with parenchymal lung infiltrates. Aspiration pneumonia is more common in the posterior segment of the upper lobes and superior segment of the lower lobes (Option D): Aspiration pneumonia classically affects the dependent lung segments , particularly the posterior segment of the upper lobes and the superior segment of the lower lobes , especially in supine patients .",

Incorrect options: Option A. Abscess: An abscess is a localized collection of pus within the lung tissue. It typically presents with symptoms such as fever, productive cough, and chest pain. While abscesses can occur in the lungs, they are less likely in this case since the CXR findings do not show a clear circumscribed cavity. Option C. Cavity: A cavity refers to a hollow space within the lung that is often formed as a result of necrotizing lung infections, such as tuberculosis. Cavity formation is characterized by the presence of a well-defined, air-filled space within the lung parenchyma. The provided information and CXR image do not strongly suggest the presence of a cavity. Option D.
