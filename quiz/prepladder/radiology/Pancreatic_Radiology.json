      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "MRCP. The alternating areas of narrowing and dilation give the bile ducts a characteristic \"beaded\" or string-of-pearls appearance. This pattern reflects the chronic, patchy inflammation and fibrosis that affects both intrahepatic and extrahepatic bile ducts in PSC, making it a key diagnostic feature for this condition. There is also obliteration of the peripheral portions of the ducts - giving it the “pruned tree” appearance. MRCP showing a beaded appearance of dilated intrahepatic bile ducts in PSC ERCP A) Beaded appearance, B) Pruned tree appearance, C) Band-like strictures Diffuse dilation of bile ducts (Option A): PSC does not cause uniform dilation throughout the bile ducts. Instead, the disease leads to segmental areas of narrowing (strictures) and dilations, which result from progressive inflammation and fibrosis of the bile ducts. A single long stricture in the common bile duct (Option C): A single long stricture would be more indicative of cholangiocarcinoma or a malignant obstruction, rather than PSC. Multiple large masses in the liver (Option D): The presence of large masses in the liver would suggest a different pathology, such as metastatic liver disease or advanced hepatocellular carcinoma, rather than PSC.",

Radiographic Diagnosis : Air detected in the gallbladder wall or bile ducts without any abnormal communication to the GI tract. Ultrasound Features : Highly echogenic reflectors with low-level posterior shadowing and reverberation artefact (dirty shadowing and ring-down artefact). Champagne Sign : Pathognomonic sign showing non-shadowing echogenic foci rising from the dependent portion of the gallbladder, resembling bubbles in champagne. CT Imaging : The most sensitive and specific modality for detecting gas within the gallbladder wall or lumen. Pneumoperitoneum on CT suggests gallbladder perforation. Chronic cholecystitis (Option A) and Acute calculous Cholecystitis (Option B) are less likely as they do not usually feature gas in the gallbladder wall or pneumoperitoneum.

      "explanation": "works by injecting a radioactive tracer that travels through the biliary system, highlighting any bile leakage. However, it cannot precisely identify the origin of the leak, making it less useful for surgical planning or pinpointing the exact location. HIDA scan: Most sensitive for bile leak (gold standard is ERCP) Most accurate for acute cholecystitis (IOC- USG) Best investigation to rule out EHBA (gold standard - PTC) CECT (Option B): CECT is the initial imaging study used in patients with suspected postoperative complications. It is useful for identifying localized fluid collections such as bilomas (encapsulated bile) or abscesses. While it can indicate the presence of fluid that might suggest a bile leak, it is less sensitive than HIDA for confirming the leak itself and may miss smaller leaks. MRI with Hepatobiliary Contrast (Option C): MRI with hepatobiliary-specific contrast agents, like gadoxetate disodium, effectively visualises the anatomy of the biliary system and can identify the exact location of a leak by showing contrast extravasation, but it is not sensitive in detecting leaks as compared to HIDA scan. Percutaneous Transhepatic Cholangiography (Option D): PTC is a specialized imaging technique where a contrast dye is injected directly into the bile ducts through a needle inserted into the liver. While it can provide details of the biliary anatomy, it is not typically the first choice for detecting leaks and is used more often when ductal injury is suspected.",

Biliary atresia also presents with persistent jaundice and pale stools in infancy, which further supports this diagnosis. Triangular cord sign on USG Other Investigations: HIDA Scan: Lack of tracer in the duodenum after 24 hours suggests biliary atresia. Radioisotope Studies: Highly sensitive to biliary atresia but poor specificity due to other conditions affecting bile excretion (e.g., infections, metabolic diseases). Preoperative percutaneous transhepatic cholecysto-cholangiography combined with liver biopsy has 100% sensitivity Definitive diagnosis: Intraoperative cholangiography Choledochal Cyst (Option A): They are characterized by abnormal dilation of the bile ducts, which is absent in this case. Ultrasound in choledochal cysts typically shows prominent bile ducts and potential cystic formations, thus making it an unlikely diagnosis. Neonatal Hepatitis (Option C): Although neonatal hepatitis can cause jaundice in infants, it does not present with the triangular cord sign.

Magnetic Resonance Imaging • Best for assessing liver parenchyma and biliary system. • Excellent soft tissue resolution. • Effective in evaluating diffuse liver conditions like steatosis and fibrosis. • Uses gadolinium-based contrast agents (e.g., Gd-DTPA, Gd-DOTA) for T1 enhancement. • Breath-hold 3D T1 weighted sequences allow multiphasic examinations similar to CT. • Hepatobiliary-specific agents target the reticulo-endothelial system (RES) or hepatocytes. • T1-Weighted Images I Normal Liver Parenchyma: Hyperintense compared to muscle, spleen, and kidney.

      "explanation": "gallstones seen on imaging. by a triradiate pattern created by gas fissures within the gallstones, which resemble the three-pointed star logo of the Mercedes-Benz automobile. Ultrasound Findings of Gallstones: Appearance: Bright (echogenic) foci with acoustic shadowing. False Negatives: Common due to small stones or poor acoustic access. Differentiation from Polyps: Mobility or acoustic shadowing helps. Double-Arc Shadow Sign: Seen with a gallbladder full of stones, showing two echogenic lines and dense shadowing. Mercedes-Benz Sign in Gallstones: A star-shaped pattern of gas-fissuring within gallstones. It is observed in about 50% of gallstones; often fluid-filled, with some containing nitrogen gas. Indicates potential complications such as cholecystitis, emphasising the need for detailed imaging. Gallstone vs Renal stone: Gallstones Renal Stones Composed of cholesterol, bilirubin, and calcium salts. Comprises various minerals: calcium oxalate, uric acid, struvite, and cystine. Gallstones are better visualised on USG. Renal stones are better seen on CT Cholesterol stones may be hard to see on X-rays but are identifiable via ultrasound due to acoustic shadows. (Option A ruled out) Uric acid stones require non-contrast CT for detection, as they may not show on X-rays. Diagnostic Imaging Techniques Gallstones Renal Stones USG: Commonly used; no ionising radiation. USG: Limited use. CT Scans: Highly sensitive for both stones. CT Scans: Highly sensitive, detects small/radiolucent stones. X-rays: Limited effectiveness. X-rays: Effective for calcium oxalate stones. Pigment stones are primarily composed of cholesterol and easily visible on X-ray (Option C ruled out): Pigment stones are primarily composed of bilirubin and calcium salts, and they might be visible on X-rays. All gallstones require immediate surgical intervention (Option D ruled out): Many gallstones are asymptomatic and do not require immediate surgical intervention unless complications arise.",

Feature Magnetic Resonance Cholangiopancreatography (MRCP) Endoscopic Retrograde Cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) Indications • Indications include suspected bile duct calculus, cholestasis, pre-surgical biliary evaluation, biliary leak, unknown aetiology sclerosing cholangitis, and unsuccessful or contraindicated ERCP. • Not typically used for interventions. (Option A ruled out) • It allows for visual assessment of the duodenum and ampulla of Vater. • Allows biopsies, stone extraction, and other Interventional procedures like sphincterotomy, biliary stenting, and biliary stricture dilation.
