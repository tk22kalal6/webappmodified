      "explanation": "usually occurs at the thoracolumbar junction (T10-L2). It is a horizontal fracture that extends through the spinous process, pedicles, and vertebral body, affecting the posterior and middle columns of the spine. Incorrect Options: Option A - Compression Fracture: The vertebral body becomes wedge-shaped due to the collapse of the anterior portion, with the posterior height usually preserved. Option B - Burst Fracture: The vertebral body is shattered, with fragments extending into the spinal canal, potentially causing spinal cord compression. Option D - Impacted fracture: Impacted Fracture shows overlapping bone fragments leading to increased density at the site of injury.",

      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: A) PCL Explanation: The posterior cruciate ligament (PCL) is a key ligament in the knee joint, located at the back of the knee. It prevents the tibia from sliding backward relative to the femur and provides stability, especially during activities like walking, running, and jumping. Knee Ligaments The knee joint is stabilized by several ligaments, including the PCL , ACL , and other supportive ligaments like the patellar tendon . Each of these ligaments plays an important role in maintaining the structural integrity of the knee, facilitating movement, and preventing injury. Comparison of Knee Ligaments and Tendons Structure Location Function Injury Characteristics PCL (Posterior Cruciate Ligament) Back of the knee joint Prevents tibia from sliding backward, stabilizes knee Less common than ACL injury; caused by high-impact trauma (e.g., car accidents, contact sports); symptoms include instability, pain, and swelling ACL (Anterior Cruciate Ligament) Front of the knee joint Prevents tibia from sliding forward, controls rotational movement Common in sports with sudden stops, direction changes, or jumps (e.g., football, basketball, skiing); symptoms include pain, swelling, and functional loss Patellar Tendon Connects patella (kneecap) to tibia Enables knee extension during walking and running Injured due to trauma or overuse; symptoms include pain, swelling, and difficulty straightening the knee ACL (Option B) : The anterior cruciate ligament is located in the front of the knee, preventing excessive forward movement of the tibia. This is not the ligament in question here. Patellar Tendon (Option C) : The patellar tendon",

      },
      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: C) Bone marrow Explanation: Bone marrow is the most radiosensitive tissue in the human body because it contains rapidly dividing hematopoietic stem cells , which are highly vulnerable to ionizing radiation. Radiation exposure can lead to pancytopenia , increasing the risk of infections, anemia, and bleeding. Radiosensitivity of Different Tissues Tissue Radiosensitivity Reason Bone marrow Highly radiosensitive Contains rapidly dividing stem cells for blood cell production Lymphoid tissue Highly radiosensitive Rapid cell turnover, easily damaged by radiation Gastrointestinal mucosa Moderately radiosensitive Epithelial cells divide rapidly Skin Moderate Basal layer is sensitive, but outer layers provide some protection Muscle Radioresistant Cells do not divide frequently Nervous tissue Highly radioresistant Neurons are non-dividing cells and less affected by radiation Skin (Option A): Moderately radiosensitive due to the presence of basal cell layers, but not as sensitive as bone marrow. Muscles (Option B): Incorrect because muscle cells are highly radioresistant as they do not actively divide. Nervous tissue (Option D): Incorrect because neurons are non-dividing and among the most radioresistant cells in the body.

Muscle from anterior aspect crossing hip joint anteriorly - Iliopsoas muscle. Pulling the femur anteriorly causing the hip flexion- Iliopsoas muscle (Proximal muscle) - Chief muscle for hip flexion. The psoas muscle is a large muscle located in the lower back that plays a key role in hip flexion and stabilization of the spine. Psoas abscesses can occur as a complication of spinal tuberculosis, with the infection spreading from the vertebral column to the adjacent psoas muscle.

      },
      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: A) Slipped capital femoral epiphysis Explanation: Slipped capital femoral epiphysis (SCFE) is a disorder of adolescents in which the growth plate is damaged and the femoral head moves (“slips”) with respect to the rest of the femur. It results in a non-traumatic painful hip of adolescence. Usually, an anteroposterior view of the pelvis and frog lateral views of both hips helps in the diagnosis of SCFE. Frog Leg Lateral View: Indication: Used in the assessment of: Slipped capital femoral epiphysis Perthes disease Procedure: The patient is supine with the affected limb flexed at the knee approximately 30° to 40°, and the hip is abducted 45°. The beam is focused midway between the anterior superior iliac spine and the pubic symphysis. If it is a bilateral examination, both knees are to rest on sponges, giving the appearance of \"frog legs.\" Perthes disease (Option B) is a childhood disease that occurs when the blood supply to the femoral head of the hip joint is temporarily interrupted and the bone begins to die. This can cause pain, limping, and limited movement of the hip joint. The early signs of Perthes disease may be joint effusion and widening of medial joint space. In the advanced burnt-out stage femoral head and neck deformity occur. Developmental dysplasia of the hip (DDH) (Option C) is a disorder that is due to abnormal development of the acetabulum with or without hip dislocation. This condition may occur at any time, from conception to skeletal maturity and the child may be born with dislocation or instability of the hip joint which then may result in hip dysplasia. Ankylosing spondylitis (Option D) is a chronic,",

      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer C- Idiopathic Explanation: Idiopathic scoliosis is the most common type of scoliosis, accounting for the majority of cases. It refers to scoliosis of unknown cause and typically develops during adolescence. The age of the patient in this scenario aligns with the typical onset of idiopathic scoliosis, making it the most likely cause. Scoliosis: Scoliosis is defined as a lateral curvature of the spine with a Cobb angle of >10°, as measured on a standing radiograph. It commonly develops during adolescence. Causes: Idiopathic Scoliosis: Most common, with no known cause. Typically develops in adolescence. Congenital Scoliosis: Results from abnormal fetal spinal development. Neuromuscular Scoliosis: Associated with neurological or muscular disorders like cerebral palsy or muscular dystrophy. Degenerative Scoliosis: Caused by age-related degeneration, often seen in older adults. Types: Structural Scoliosis: Permanent curvature of the spine. Nonstructural Scoliosis: Functional or temporary, often corrects when lying down. Clinical Features: Uneven shoulders or hips. Leaning to one side",

      "explanation": "Potts's spine. It is suggestive of the Paradisaical type of Potts's spine as the infection is destroying adjacent vertebral bodies causing disc space narrowing and weakness of the spine. Therefore, option d is the correct choice. Pott’s spine is an extrapulmonary manifestation of TB. Disc Space Narrowing, paravertebral abscess, and vertebral lysis are common features observed in the case of Pott’s spine x-ray. Incorrect Options: Option A - Multiple Myeloma: It shows Cannon ball Metastasis, Decreased Bone thickness, usually present in the elderly age group. On MRI of the lumbosacral spine, collapsed vertebrae are observed. The sagittal T1 image of the lumbar spine should show a salt-and-pepper appearance of the vertebral marrow in the patient. Since none of them are observed, it is an incorrect choice. Option B - Ankylosis Spondylitis: It shows features of Sacroiliitis, i.e., inflammation of the sacroiliac joint on Radiology, which isn’t observed in the given MRI image. Thus, it is an incorrect choice. Option C - Pyogenic Spondylitis: It presents with an abscess in proximity to the spine. Regional osteopenia, new bone apposition, and peripheral sclerosis are some of the radiographic features. Since the given MRI doesn’t show any abscess, it is concluded that option c is an incorrect choice. Reference: .",

The age of the patient in this scenario aligns with the typical onset of idiopathic scoliosis, making it the most likely cause. Incorrect options: Option A. Congenital: Congenital scoliosis is a type of spinal deformity that is present at birth and is caused by abnormal vertebral development. It is typically detected early in life and is unlikely to be the cause in a 10-year-old girl who only recently presented with a back deformity. Option B. NF1 (Neurofibromatosis type 1): Neurofibromatosis type 1 is a genetic disorder that can cause various complications, including scoliosis. However, scoliosis associated with NF1 often presents earlier in childhood and is typically associated with other signs and symptoms of the condition. Therefore, NF1 is less likely to be the cause in this scenario. Option D. Neuromuscular: Neuromuscular scoliosis is a type of scoliosis that occurs due to underlying",

Hyperparathyroidism is a condition characterized by overactivity of the parathyroid glands, resulting in excessive production of parathyroid hormone (PTH). Incorrect Option: Option B: Multiple myeloma- Multiple myeloma is a type of cancer that affects plasma cells in the bone marrow. While multiple myeloma can cause bone lesions and bone destruction, the specific \"salt and pepper\" appearance of the skull on X-ray is not typically associated with this condition. Option C: Hyperthyroidism- Hyperthyroidism is a condition characterized by overactive thyroid function, resulting in excessive production of thyroid hormones. While hyperthyroidism can affect bone metabolism and density, it does not commonly cause the \"salt and pepper\" appearance of the skull on X-ray. Option D: Paget's disease- Paget's disease of bone is a chronic condition characterized by abnormal bone remodeling, leading to enlarged bones.
