      "correct_answer": "D",
      "explanation": "attenuated (weakened) pathogens that induce a strong immune response. Rotavirus, Measles, and Varicella vaccines are all live attenuated vaccines. Hepatitis B vaccine contains HBsAg (Hepatitis B surface antigen) and is inactivated. Live vs. Inactivated Vaccines Vaccines can be classified into live attenuated vaccines and inactivated vaccines based on their mechanism of inducing immunity. Live Attenuated Vaccines (LAVs) Contain weakened versions of the pathogen. Provide strong, long-lasting immunity with fewer doses. Not given to immunocompromised individuals due to risk of reactivation. Examples of Live Vaccines: Vaccine Disease Prevented Rotavirus Rotavirus gastroenteritis Measles, Mumps, Rubella (MMR) Measles, Mumps, Rubella Varicella Chickenpox Oral Polio Vaccine (OPV) Poliomyelitis Yellow Fever Yellow Fever BCG Tuberculosis Inactivated Vaccines Contain killed or non-infectious components of the pathogen. Require booster doses for sustained immunity. Safer for immunocompromised patients. Examples of Inactivated Vaccines: Vaccine Disease Prevented Type Hepatitis B Hepatitis B Recombinant subunit Polio (IPV) Poliomyelitis Inactivated Rabies Rabies Inactivated Influenza (Injectable) Influenza Inactivated COVID-19 (Covaxin, Sinopharm) COVID-19 Inactivated Rotavirus (Option A): Incorrect because it is a live oral vaccine used to prevent severe rotavirus diarrhea. Measles (Option C): Incorrect because it is part of the MMR vaccine , which is live attenuated. Varicella (Option D): Incorrect because it is a live attenuated vaccine used to prevent chickenpox .

      "explanation": "receive additional protection in disaster situations Cholera, typhoid, and tetanus toxoid vaccinations provided to minimize infection risk Ensures safety while providing medical care Vaccination protocol post- disaster : All vaccines except for measles are contraindicated post-disaster. Multidose vaccines, such as typhoid and cholera vaccines, have poor compliance and have not yet proven to be effective as a large-scale public health measure. The most common post-disaster outbreak is measles. For this reason, measles vaccines can be given within three days of exposure since the time taken for antibodies to form is less than the natural incubation period of the disease. Tetanus vaccine is given based on previous vaccinations and severity of injury. Vaccines for healthcare workers: Cholera, Typhoid, Tetanus, Hep B. Everyone is given diphtheria (Option A) : Diphtheria vaccination likely already part of routine immunization schedules Everyone is given tetanus toxoid (Option B) : Tetanus toxoid crucial in disaster scenarios, especially for those with injuries Everyone is given cholera vaccine (Option C) : Cholera vaccination not typically administered to everyone in general disaster response Reference: Park’s Textbook of Preventive and Social Medicine, 27th Edition Pg 111",

It is a color-changing indicator attached to vaccine vials to help assess whether a vaccine has been stored or transported at the correct temperature. This helps in determining if a vaccine remains safe and effective for use. VMV (Option A) : There is no known vaccine-related term called VMV. MVV (Option C) : This is not a recognized term related to vaccine heat resistance. VMM (Option D) : This also is not related to heat resistance in vaccines.

      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: A) Killed and intramuscular. Explanation: Japanese Encephalitis (JE) is the most common cause of viral encephalitis outbreaks in endemic regions. The Japanese Encephalitis vaccine (JE vaccine) is available in two types: inactivated (killed) and live attenuated. The inactivated (killed) vaccine is commonly given intramuscularly (IM) as part of mass vaccination programs in outbreak settings. Live attenuated vaccines (like SA 14-14-2) are administered subcutaneously (SC), but they are generally used for routine immunization rather than in acute outbreak settings. Types of Japanese Encephalitis Vaccines Vaccine Type Examples Route of Administration Usage Inactivated (Killed) JEEV, IXIARO Intramuscular (IM) Used in outbreaks & travelers Live Attenuated SA 14-14-2 Subcutaneous (SC) Routine immunization Live and subcutaneous (Option B) : Incorrect. Although there is a live attenuated JE vaccine (e.g., SA 14-14-2 ), it is usually administered subcutaneously, not intramuscularly. However, this option does not align with standard killed vaccines used in most vaccination drives. Live and intramuscular (Option C) : Incorrect. Live attenuated vaccines for JE are administered subcutaneously, not intramuscularly. Killed and subcutaneous (Option D) : Incorrect. Killed vaccines are administered intramuscularly, not subcutaneously. Reference: Park’s Textbook of Preventive and Social Medicine, Edition 27, Page 332, 333",

      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: B) Measles/MMR Explanation: Measles/MMR should be avoided due to the live virus components, which can be risky for immunocompromised children. A child who has a history of repeated yeast infections and respiratory viral infections may have an underlying immune deficiency or immunodeficiency disorder . Immunocompromised children, particularly those with T-cell deficiency (such as in conditions like DiGeorge syndrome or severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID) ), should avoid live vaccines due to the risk of severe infection. The Measles, Mumps, and Rubella (MMR) vaccine contains live attenuated viruses for measles, mumps, and rubella. In immunocompromised children, live vaccines pose a risk of causing active infections or serious complications due to their weakened immune system.

        "D": "Mumps"
      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer B - Measles: Amongst the above options, measles vaccine has a faster seroconversion rate as compared to the incubation period of the disease and this is why measles vaccine is given when a disaster or an epidemic occurs. Seroconversion: is the transition from the point of viral infection to when antibodies of the virus become present in the blood. Seroconversion rates are one of the methods used for determining the efficacy of a vaccine. The higher the rate of seroconversion, the more protective the vaccine for a greater proportion of the population. Seroconversion does not inherently confer immunity or resistance to infection. Only some antibodies, such as anti-spike antibodies for COVID-19, confer protection. Coronavirus (Option A): The coronavirus vaccine has almost the same seroconversion rate as compared to the incubation period of the disease. Polio (Option C): The seroconversion rate of the polio vaccine is slower than its incubation period. Mumps (Option D): The mumps vaccine has a slower seroconversion rate than its incubation period.

It significantly reduces the viral load at the site. Clean the wound with spirit (3) : This is correct . After washing and drying the wound, disinfectants like povidone-iodine and spirit can be applied. Loose suturing of the wound with proper dressing (4) : Suturing is avoided in rabies-prone wounds unless absolutely necessary. If required, it is done only after administering rabies immunoglobulin (RIG) around the wound.

It is particularly useful in areas with unreliable cold chain systems. 2. It shows cumulative exposure of the vaccine to the heat. This is also true. The VVM works by showing the cumulative amount of heat the vaccine has been exposed to, indicating whether the vaccine has been subjected to conditions that might reduce its efficacy. 3. It can be used to assess the potential efficacy of the vaccine. This is false. The VVM does not directly assess the efficacy of the vaccine. It only shows whether the vaccine has been exposed to heat beyond its acceptable limit, which might affect its effectiveness. 4. Calculation of the expiry date can be done using VVM. This is false. The VVM does not calculate the expiry date of the vaccine. It is used to monitor heat exposure, not to predict or calculate the expiry date. 5. The expiry date of the vaccine can be relaxed if VVM is in an acceptable range. This is false. The VVM cannot be used to relax the expiry date of a vaccine. If the vaccine has been exposed to temperatures beyond the recommended limit, its efficacy may be compromised regardless of its expiration date. 6. If the square and the circle are the same in color, then the vaccine can be safely used. This is false. When the square and circle on the VVM are the same color, it indicates that the vaccine has been exposed to heat for too long and should not be used, as it may have lost its potency.

Vaccination is a critical preventive strategy. Recommended Vaccines for Adults ≥ 65 Years Vaccine Purpose Recommended After 65? Influenza Prevents seasonal flu complications Yes, annually Pneumococcal (PCV15/PCV20, PPSV23) Prevents pneumonia, bacteremia, meningitis Yes, once or as per schedule Herpes Zoster (Recombinant Zoster Vaccine - RZV) Prevents shingles and postherpetic neuralgia Yes, 2 doses after 50 years Tetanus, Diphtheria, Pertussis (Tdap/Td) Prevents tetanus and pertussis Yes, booster every 10 years COVID-19 Reduces risk of severe COVID-19 Yes, as per updated recommendations HPV Prevents cervical and other cancers Not recommended after 45 years Why is the HPV Vaccine Not Given After 65? Most individuals are already exposed to HPV by this age. Vaccine efficacy is highest in younger populations (9-26 years). No added benefit in older adults, as HPV-related cancer risk decreases. Influenza (Option A): Incorrect because annual flu vaccination is recommended to prevent severe complications. Herpes Zoster (Option B): Incorrect because shingles risk increases with age, so vaccination is advised after 50 years . Pneumococcal (Option C): Incorrect because pneumococcal vaccine is recommended after 65 years to prevent pneumonia and invasive infections .
