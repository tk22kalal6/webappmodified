Steps of the Health planning cycle include: Analysis of health situation - Socio-demographic profiling of the community to understand the health situation. Set objectives and goals - specific and detailed, which may be short or long-term. Resources Deciding priorities Formulating a plan - Listing down the necessary acts to be done. Programming and Implementation: Define roles and tasks, train and supervise manpower, and organise effectively to achieve predetermined objectives. Monitoring - Day-to-day activities are monitored to ensure proper implementation of the plan Evaluation - measuring the final outcome and associated factors of the plan.",

      "explanation": "Correct Answer: B) Goal Explanation: The goal in health planning represents the ultimate desired state towards which all objectives and resources are directed. Not constrained by time and resources Timeframe guidelines should not extend beyond a five-year period. Objective (Option C) represents the planned endpoint of all activities. Objectives should be SMART, which stands for: S: Specific M: Measurable A: Achievable R: Realistic T: Time-bound Target (Option A) measures the degree of achievement of objectives with time. Targets are short-term. E.g. To complete the objective, i.e., increase immunization coverage by 60%., one needs to target conducting 1 health education session per week. A strategy (Option D ) is a comprehensive plan or approach designed to achieve specific goals or objectives. Reference: Park’s Textbook of Preventive and Social Medicine, 27th Edition, Pg.no. 996",

      "explanation": "Correct Answer: B) NITI Aayog Explanation: NITI (National Institution for Transforming India) Aayog is the organisation responsible for developing the Health Index in India . The Health Index is a composite measure that tracks the performance of Indian states and Union Territories on various health indicators, such as the Neonatal Mortality Rate and the Under-5 Mortality Rate. NITI Aayog replaced the Planning Commission of India in 2015 , and acts as a think tank to the central and state governments on policy matters, including health. The Ministry of Health and Family Welfare collaborates with NITI Aayog and provides data but is not the primary organization for evaluating and releasing the Health Index. (Option A) The Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) focuses on biomedical research and is not involved in creating the Health Index. (Option C) The World Health Organization (WHO) is an international body providing health-related guidelines and support but not developing the Health Index for India. (Option D).",

      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: B) Programme Evaluation and Review Technique (PERT) Explanation: Programme Evaluation and Review Technique (PERT) is a type of quantitative health management method that involves creating a graphical representation (often an Arrow Diagram) of all events and activities required to complete a project. It identifies the sequence of activities, calculates the time needed for each, and highlights critical activities that must be completed on time to ensure the overall project is finished as scheduled. Systems Analysis is a quantitative health management method that focuses on investigating problems, finding objectives, and evaluating alternatives for cost-effectiveness but does not involve graphical & time-oriented project planning. (Option A) Cost-effectiveness analysis is a type of quantitative health management method that evaluates the outcomes of different options in terms of costs and benefits to ensure (Option C) Planning–Programming–Budgeting System (PPBS) is a type of quantitative health management method for allocating resources efficiently within an organisation. Still, it does not focus on graphical project management or critical path identification.

      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Cost-Effectiveness Analysis compares the costs to achieve a specific non-monetary outcome. Correct Answer: B) Cost-benefit analysis compares monetary costs and benefits, whereas Cost-Effective Analysis compares the costs to achieve a specific non-monetary outcome. Explanation: Cost-Benefit Analysis It is a management technique that compares a program's monetary costs with its monetary benefits , expressed in terms of economic gain. It helps determine whether the benefits outweigh the costs in monetary terms. The main drawback with this technique is that the benefits in the health field cannot always be expressed in monetary terms . Cost-Effective Analysis Compares the costs of different interventions to achieve a specific health outcome that is not expressed in monetary terms. It is used to determine the most efficient way to achieve a particular health goal, such as lives saved or cases treated , without converting the outcomes into monetary values.

Correct Answer: C) Work Sampling helps to calculate the total project cost by evaluating the monetary benefits of health interventions. Explanation: Work Sampling does not involve calculating project costs or evaluating monetary benefits . It is primarily used to systematically observe and record the activities of individuals at random intervals to estimate how time is allocated among various tasks , aiding in workforce management and efficiency improvement.
