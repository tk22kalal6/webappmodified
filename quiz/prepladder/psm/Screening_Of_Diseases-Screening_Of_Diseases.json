      "explanation": "Correct Answer: C) Yield Explanation: Yield is not one of the inherent properties of a screening test. Yield is defined as the number of new cases detected due to a screening test. It can be increased by restricting the sample size to high-risk groups, e.g., the presence of cardiovascular diseases in those who smoke. Disadvantage: identifying a small high-risk group can be difficult since some diseases might need a tedious filtration process to identify the high-risk population. Inherent properties of a screening test: Predictive accuracy Negative predictive value (Option A). Positive predictive value (Option D). Accuracy (Option B) - sensitivity & specificity.

      "explanation": "Correct ANSWER: C) Positive predictive value is directly proportional to the prevalence detects, i.e., PPV increases as the prevalence increases provided the sensitivity and specificity of the test remains unchanged over the course of time (since prevalence can be considered as the pre-test probability of a disease) Example: Total population of a town is 2000. Prevalence of a disease at three different time periods are 10,20 and 30% based on a definitive investigation. Sensitivity and specificity of a new test are 40% & 70% respectively Since the sensitivity & specificity are going to be considered as constants throughout, the number of true positives and hence the positive predictive values will increase proportionately to the given prevalences over these three different time periods.

      "explanation": "Correct Answer: C) 25000 Explanation: The question asks about the occurrence of an event over a defined period of time, called “prevalence.” Prevalence is the total number of cases (old & new) documented over a specific period. It can interchangeably be used with the term “point prevalence.” Incidence can be defined as the total number of new cases which occur over a specified point in time. Prevalence = Incidence x Duration In the above example, Incidence = 1 in every 200 people = 5000 per million = 25000 in total every year Duration = 5 years. Hence, prevalence = 1,25,000 in 5 million people = 25000 per million over the last 5 years.

      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "instrument. CORRECT ANSWER: C) Cronbach's alpha can be used to assess the validity of a measurement instrument. Explanation: Cronbach's alpha is a measure of internal consistency reliability, not validity. Cronbach’s alpha: It measures the internal consistency of a test or scale, indicating the extent to which all items measure the same concept or construct. Alpha ranges between 0 and 1; higher values indicate greater internal consistency. To ensure validity, it should be calculated before a test is used. Reliability interpretation: Alpha reflects the measurement error in a test; higher alpha indicates less error variance. Recommended Values: Acceptable alpha values typically range from 0.70 to 0.95; extremely high values may indicate redundant items. Reference: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4205511/",

      "explanation": "CORRECT ANSWER: A) Positive likelihood ratio Explanation: Positive likelihood ratio = Sensitivity/(1-specificity). Negative likelihood ratio = (1-sensitivity)/specificity. Likelihood ratios (LRs) compare the probability of a particular test result in people with the disease to the probability of the same result in people without the disease. Interpretation: LR of 1.0 means the test result is equally likely in those with and without the disease (no discrimination). Positive likelihood ratio Negative likelihood ratio It represents how much more likely a positive test result is in individuals with the disease than those without it. LR+ > 1 indicates a positive test result is more likely in those with the disease. Higher LR+ values (>10) indicate strong evidence of disease. Indicates how much less likely a negative test result is in individuals with the disease compared to those without the disease. LR- < 1 indicates a negative test result is less likely in those with the disease. Lower LR- values (<0.1) suggest strong evidence for excluding the disease.

      "explanation": "Correct Answer: D) Interobserver variation Explanation: Interobserver variability refers to the differences in interpreting diagnostic tests or clinical findings between observers. This can occur even when both observers are highly trained and using the same diagnostic criteria. Individual judgment, experience, and subjective assessment contribute to this variability. Properties of a screening test: Acceptability. Reliability/reproducibility/repeatability/consistency/precision. Validity/accuracy. Reliability: It refers to the consistency of a measurement or diagnostic test. High reliability means repeated measurements or interpretations by different observers produce similar results. Depends on 3 Factors: Observer Variability Biological Variation Errors Related to Technology Interobserver Variation: Differences between different observers. Example: Two doctors interpret the same ECG differently, which leads to different diagnoses. Natural changes in a patient's physiological parameters over time. For example, blood pressure fluctuates daily, and cholesterol levels vary with diet. Inaccuracies in measurement are due to malfunctioning equipment. For example, a faulty thermometer gives inconsistent temperatures. Intraobserver Variation: Differences in interpretation by the same observer at different times. Example: The same doctor interprets an ECG differently when reviewed at different times.

      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "CORRECT ANSWER: A) Prospective Screening EXPLANATION: Prospective screening is a proactive method to identify and manage health threats, such as COVID-19, at airports to prevent widespread outbreaks and detect infected individuals. Prescriptive Screening (Option B) Prospective Screening (Option A) Done for one's own benefit. Secondary level of prevention. Early diagnosis. Done for other's benefit. The primary level of prevention. Control/ prevention of disease. E.g. Screening neonates for neonatal hypothyroidism Deafness in children Blood glucose testing for diabetes mellitus and gestational diabetes Mammography for breast cancer Pap smear for cervical cancer Visual acuity for refractive errors. E.g. Screening of immigrants for diseases like TB and COVID HIV screening for blood donation HIV screening in ANC cases Health checkups for workers in the food industry. Predictive screening( Option C) , used in genetic disorders, identifies people at high risk of developing a disease in later life. Mass Screening( Option D) is done for an entire population or a subgroup regardless of risk, such as screening all adults over 18 for high blood pressure in public places.

      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "CORRECT ANSWER: B) Multiphasic Screening EXPLANATION: Pap smear is a type of multiphasic screening that involves multiple tests, often starting with simple tests followed by more complex ones if initial results indicate a risk. Types of screening tests: 1. Mass Screening (OPTION C) All individuals screened irrespective of high risk. Least efficient type of screening. 2. High-risk screening/ selective screening/ targeted screening (OPTION A) Only high-risk individuals are screened. Most efficient form of screening. E.g.: Hypertension screening in the elderly. TB screening in lower socio-economic population. Breast cancer screening with a family history of breast cancer. 3. Multiphasic screening Application of 2 or more screening tests in combination to a large number of people at one time to detect a single disease. E.g., Health camps for cervical cancer: Questionnaire, Pap smear , Visual inspection. 4. Multipurpose screening (OPTION D) Screen the population with more than one test done simultaneously to detect more than one disease Screening blood tests of pregnant females (Hb, RA, HIV, VDRL, HbsAg) 5. Opportunistic screening or Case-finding Screening conducted during routine healthcare visits for other reasons Presumptive identification was not raised at the patient's request E.g., Screen everyone above 30 for hypertension Reference: Park’s Textbook of Preventive and Social Medicine, 26th Edition, Page: 153",

      "explanation": "Correct Answer: B) B to Y Explanation: Lead time: Time gained by early detection of disease or time difference between the earliest possible point of diagnosis and the usual time of diagnosis. Lead time bias: Early detection of disease before symptom onset and starting treatment early increases life expectancy; however, it does not make the patient live longer. Arise when no treatment for the disease is available Do not change the prognosis with early diagnosis. (early-stage cancer, if treatment is not available). There is no actual effect on survival, just a longer period with diagnosis. It decreases mortality rates and increases disease prevalence.
