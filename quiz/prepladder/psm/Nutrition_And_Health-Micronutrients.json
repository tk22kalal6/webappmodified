      "explanation": "Correct Answer: B) Night blindness Explanation: Night blindness (XN) is the initial clinical manifestation of Vitamin A deficiency. Individuals with night blindness have difficulty seeing in low light or at night. This condition occurs because Vitamin A is essential for producing rhodopsin, a pigment found in the retina. (Rhodopsin = 11- cis Retinal + Opsin ) Without adequate Vitamin A, the eyes cannot adapt well to darkness, leading to night blindness. Night blindness is an early indicator, alerting to possible deficiencies before more severe eye conditions develop.

      "question": "A 32-year-old female presents with weakness, fatigue, and tingling sensations in her extremities. Upon further investigation, she has dry beriberi. Which of the following dietary habits will most likely lead to this condition?",
      "options": {
        "A": "High fat, low carbohydrate diet",
        "B": "Diet predominantly of polished white rice",
        "C": "Vegan diet",
        "D": "Gluten-Free Diet"
      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: B) Diet predominantly of polished white rice Explanation: A diet predominantly of polished white rice can lead to thiamine (vitamin B1) deficiency as Thiamine is lost during the process of milling. It is water soluble; thus, further loss occurs during washing and cooking. Thiamine is also lost if the food is baked with baking soda, e.g. bread and cereals. Thiamine deficiency also occurs in chronic alcoholics (Wernike’s encephalopathy) Deficiency of thiamine leads to Dry beriberi (Peripheral neuritis) Wet beriberi (High output cardiac failure) Infantile beriberi (Seen in infants 2 - 4 months of age who are breastfed by thiamine deficient mother). Wernicke's encephalopathy (Chronic alcoholics): Confusion + ophthalmoplegia + ataxia To prevent thiamine deficiency due to dietary habits, it is advised to Consume parboiled and under-milled rice. Have a well-balanced diet. Reduce alcohol consumption. High fat, low-carbohydrate diet (Option A) is also known as the ketogenic diet. It does not cause thiamine deficiency, but it can lead to ketoacidosis in the body. Vegan diet (Option C) consists of a good mix of plant-based products that are rich in thiamine; thus, vitamin B1 deficiency rarely occurs, but since the diet lacks dairy and animal products, it can lead to Vitamin B12, Vitamin D, and Iron and Calcium deficiency. Gluten-Free Diet (Option D) is mainly used to manage celiac disease or gluten intolerance; it has no direct involvement in causing thiamine deficiency.

Vitamin B2 (Riboflavin) Sources Function Deficiency Milk Eggs Liver Green leafy vegetables Cofactor for glutathione reductase.

Angular stomatitis Glossitis Nasolabial dyssebacia It can also lead to Neuromotor dysfunction Poor wound healing Cataract (Image-1: Geographic tongue, image 2- angular cheilitis, image 3- magenta colored tongue) Riboflavin deficiency commonly occurs with pyridoxine (vitamin B6) deficiency. Riboflavin is vital for producing flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD), a key coenzyme in energy metabolism. Deficiency impairs energy production and nutrient metabolism. Vitamin E (Option A) deficiency leads to ataxia, blindness, dementia and cardiac arrhythmias. Vitamin B5 (Option B) is a precursor for Coenzyme A, and its deficiency leads to fatigue, headache, personality changes, muscle cramps, paresthesia, and muscle/abdominal cramps. Vitamin B6 (Option D) deficiency leads to peripheral neuropathy and does not cause angular stomatitis, but it often occurs along with vitamin B2 deficiency, which can lead to angular stomatitis.",

      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: B) Vitamin C Explanation: Scurvy occurs due to vitamin C deficiency and manifests as swelling and bleeding of the gums, easy bruising, delayed wound healing, and bleeding into joints. Sources of vitamin C are Indian gooseberry, fresh fruits, green leafy vegetables, and germinating pulses. Functions of vitamin C: Hydroxylation of Collagen. Iron absorption in the stomach. Inhibition of nitrosamine formation in the intestine. Manifestations of Vitamin C: Bleeding gums Subcutaneous bruising Delayed wound healing Weakness Hemarthrosis Anaemia (Vitamin C is essential for the absorption of iron from the diet) Vitamin B2 (Option A) (riboflavin) acts as a cofactor for glutathione reductase, an antioxidant that protects the mucocutaneous membrane. Its deficiency leads to glossitis and stomatitis, not scurvy. Vitamin D (Option C) is essential for calcium homeostasis and bone health; its deficiency leads to rickets in children and osteomalacia in adults. Iron (Option D) is necessary for haemoglobin production, catechol metabolism, thermoregulation and muscle activity. Its deficiency leads to iron deficiency anaemia and impaired cell-mediated immunity.",

      "explanation": "Correct Answer: D) Whole grains Explanation: The patient's fatigue, muscle weakness, and bone pain are signs of vitamin D deficiency. Her history of celiac disease likely contributes to this deficiency due to impaired nutrient absorption. While whole grains are nutritious and provide various vitamins and minerals, they are not a significant source of vitamin D. Sources that are rich in vitamin D include: The richest source is Halibut fish (Option B) Sunlight exposure (Option A) Liver, Egg yolk, butter, cheese, and cod fish. (Option C) Function of vitamin D: Intestine : Facilitates the absorption of calcium and phosphorus in the intestines. Bone: Encourages proper bone mineralisation, stimulates bone resorption, and influences collagen maturation.

      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: C) 1, 2, and 3. Explanation: Sources rich in iron: Two types: heme-iron and non-heme iron. Heme iron Heme iron is better absorbed than non-heme iron. Found in liver, meat, poultry, and fish. Promotes absorption of non-heme iron in plant foods eaten concurrently. Non-heme iron: It is found in plant-based foods such as cereals, green leafy vegetables, legumes, nuts, oilseeds, jaggery, and dried fruits. Additional Iron Sources : Cooking in iron vessels can significantly contribute to dietary iron in some areas. Iron Content in Milk : Low in all mammalian species. Breast milk contains less than 0.2 mg/dL but has good bioavailability. Bioavailability and Absorption Inhibitors : Non-heme iron absorption is hindered by phytates, oxalates, carbonates, phosphates, and dietary fibre. Foods like milk, eggs, and tea also inhibit iron absorption. Indian vegetarian diets often contain high levels of these inhibitors (e.g., phytates in bran, phosphates in egg yolk, tannin in tea, and oxalates in vegetables).
