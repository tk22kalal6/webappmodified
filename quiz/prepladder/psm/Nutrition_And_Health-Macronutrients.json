      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Correct answer: C) It contains all essential amino acids. Explanation: Eggs are known as reference proteins because they provide all the essential amino acids in the right proportions needed by the human body. This complete amino acid profile makes eggs a benchmark for evaluating the protein quality of other foods. Egg Importance Eggs are highly nutritious and rich in protein, essential vitamins, & minerals. They support muscle building, brain health, and overall wellness. Rule of 6 6 grams of protein 6 grams of fat 60 calories per large egg 6 essential vitamins (A, B2, B12, D, E, K) 60 grams average weight Others: 6x5=30 mg Calcium 6x0.25=1.5mg Iron The Net Protein Utilization (NPU) of eggs is typically around 96% . This means that 96% of the protein absorbed from eggs is retained by the body for growth and maintenance. Eggs (Option A) are easy to digest and have high bioavailability, meaning the body can efficiently absorb and utilise the protein; this characteristic alone does not make them a reference protein. Eggs are a good source of protein, but they do not have the highest protein content per gram compared to other protein-rich foods like certain types of fish or meat. (Option B) Eggs have a reasonable shelf life when stored properly, but many other protein sources, such as dried legumes or certain preserved meats, have longer shelf lives.

      "correct_answer": "D",
      "explanation": "Correct answer: D) Increase the risk of cardiovascular disease. Explanation: Unsaturated fats lower the risk of cardiovascular disease. Fats, or lipids, are essential macronutrients that play crucial roles in the body, including energy storage, hormone production, and cell structure maintenance. Importance: Energy Source: 9 calories per gram , more than twice the energy carbohydrates or proteins provide. Cellular Functions: Integral components of cell membranes, maintaining fluidity and integrity. Absorption of Fat-Soluble Vitamins A, D, E, and K Hormone Production: Steroid hormones such as estrogen, testosterone, and cortisol. Insulation and Protection. Types of Fats Saturated Fats Fatty acid chains have no double bonds, making them solid at room temperature. Predominantly found in animal products such as meat, dairy, and eggs, as well as some plant-based oils like coconut oil and palm oil. Consuming high amounts is associated with increasing levels of LDL cholesterol (bad cholesterol) in the blood, which can raise the risk of cardiovascular diseases such as heart disease and stroke. Unsaturated Fats Contain one or more double bonds in their fatty acid chains, which makes them usually liquid at room temperature. (Option A and B) Primarily found in plant-based sources such as oils, nuts, and seeds, as well as in fish. (Option C) Considered healthier for consumption as they Improve blood cholesterol levels, reduce inflammation, and lower the risk of cardiovascular disease. (Option D) Types: Monounsaturated fats: single, double bond. Polyunsaturated fats: Multiple double bonds; includes Omega-3 and Omega-6 Trans Fats Industrially produced fats are found in partially hydrogenated oils.

      "question": "A patient with a history of cardiovascular disease is advised by their doctor to incorporate oils rich in polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) into their diet, with a recommendation of oils containing more than 50% PUFA. Which of the following oils would not be recommended?",

        "D": "Coconut Oil"
      },
      "correct_answer": "D",
      "explanation": "Correct answer: D) Coconut Oil Explanation: Coconut oil is primarily composed of saturated fats, with very low levels of polyunsaturated fats. It contains approximately 6% PUFA, significantly lower than oils like safflower, sunflower, and soybean oils, which contain more than 50% PUFA. Due to its high saturated fat content, coconut oil raises LDL cholesterol levels and potentially increases the risk of cardiovascular disease. PUFA Safflower Oil 75 Sunflower Oil 62 Soybean Oil 53 Groundnut Oil 32 Palm Oil 11 Coconut Oil 2 Butter 2 Polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) : They are dietary fats characterised by having more than one double bond. Types: omega-3 and omega-6 fatty acids. Role in cardiovascular health: Lowers levels of triglycerides (a type of fat in the blood). Reduce LDL cholesterol, thereby improving the lipid profile and reducing the risk of atherosclerosis and cardiovascular disease. Oils rich in PUFA, such as safflower, sunflower, and soybean oils, are recommended for heart health because they improve blood cholesterol levels and reduce the risk of cardiovascular events when consumed in moderation.

GI measures how quickly carbohydrates in food are converted into glucose and absorbed into the bloodstream. Scale: Low GI ( ≤ 55): Foods that cause a slow and gradual rise in blood glucose levels. Medium GI (56-69): Foods that cause a moderate rise in blood glucose levels. High GI ( ≥ 70): Foods that cause a rapid and significant rise in blood glucose levels. Low GI ( ≤ 55) Medium GI (56-69) High GI ( ≥ 70) Oats Apples Oranges Lentils Chickpeas Kidney beans Barley Nuts and seeds Sweet potatoes Brown rice Pineapple Mango Watermelon Dairy products White bread Bagels White rice Sugary cereals Potato chips Dates Mashed potatoes Importance: Blood Sugar Control: Helps in managing blood sugar levels (individuals with diabetes or insulin resistance).
