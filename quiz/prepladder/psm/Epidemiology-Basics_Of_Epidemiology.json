      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: B) Disease distribution Explanation: Definition of epidemiology (by John M Last ) : Study of frequency, distribution and determinants of health-related states/events or disease in population groups and application of the study to control health problems. Components of epidemiology: Disease distribution : Disease distribution is according to time, place, and person. Descriptive epidemiology helps form an aetiological hypothesis Eg. case study, case series (Option B) Disease determinants : Answers to why and how of the disease [i.e. Identifying causes and risk factors of disease]. Helps in testing a hypothesis. Eg. ecological study, cross sectional study.. case control study, cohort study (Option A) Disease frequency : Incidence and prevalence of a disease, expressed in the form of rate, proportion, and ratio. (Option C) OBSERVATIONAL STUDIES EXPERIMENTAL/INTERVENTIONAL STUDIES Descriptive Analytical Case reports Ecological studies Randomised controlled trials Case series Case-control studies Field trials Cohort studies Community trials Cross-sectional studies Reference: Park’s Textbook of Preventive and Social Medicine, 27th edition, Page 61",

      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: C) Basic tools of measurement in epidemiology Explanation: In epidemiology, tools of measurement show disease frequency/magnitude. They are rate, ratio, and proportion. Rate : Numerator/Denominator x 1000 or 10,000 or 1,00,000 where the numerator is a part of the denominator Ratio: Numerator/Denominator where the numerator is not a part of the denominator Proportion : Numerator/Denominator x 100 where the numerator is a part of the denominator Definitions in Epidemiology Measure Definition Ratio A comparison of two numbers, e.g., male to female ratio Proportion A type of ratio where the numerator is part of the denominator, e.g., % of infected Rate A proportion with a time component, e.g., incidence rate per year These are essential for calculating incidence , prevalence , case fatality rate , etc. Tools for risk assessment (Option A): Incorrect because while rates and ratios are used in risk assessment , they are more fundamentally classified as measurement tools . Tools for biostatistical analysis (Option B): Incorrect because this is too broad and indirect—while they are used in biostatistics, their primary role in epidemiology is measurement. Measures of central tendency (Option D): Incorrect because central tendency refers to mean, median, and mode , not rate, ratio, or proportion.

        "A": "The number of students who prefer chocolate ice cream to vanilla ice cream in a class.",
        "B": "The percentage of female students in a school.",

        "D": "The ratio of males to females in a population."
      },
      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: C) The number of deaths from lung cancer per 100,000 people in a year. during a set time period. It's calculated by dividing the number of times the event happened (numerator) by the total number of people at risk (denominator) and multiplying by a standard factor, such as 1,000, 10,000, or 100,000. Example : Incidence rate = (Total number of new cases / Total population at risk) x 1000 Types of Rate Description Examples Crude Rates Actual observed rates are calculated directly from raw data without adjustments. Crude birth rate: Number of births / Total population * 1000 Specific Rates Rates that focus on specific causes Tuberculosis mortality rate: Deaths due to TB / Population at risk * 100,000 Standardised Rates Rates are adjusted to account for differences in the composition of populations when comparing different groups or populations. Age-standardized mortality rate. The number of students who prefer chocolate ice cream to vanilla ice cream in a class represents a simple comparison or proportion within a group at a specific time without considering a time period. (Option A) The percentage of female students in a school is a proportion that describes the makeup of a population at a point in time, not a rate over time. (Option B) The ratio of males to females in a population refers to a ratio that compares two distinct groups at a specific time without the element of time passage.

        "D": "(Number of females / Number of males) x 1000"
      },
      "correct_answer": "D",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: D) (Number of females / Number of males) x 1000 Explanation: A ratio compares two distinct groups by dividing the value of one group by the other, where the numerator is not part of the denominator. E.g., Sex Ratio: This ratio compares explicitly the number of females to the number of males within a population. It is typically expressed per 1000 males. Sex Ratio = (Number of females/Number of males I ) × 1000 (Number of females / Number of males) x 100 (Option A): resembles the Sex Ratio but uses a multiplier of 100 instead of the standard 1000. (Number of males / Number of females) x 100 (Option B) : This inverts the relationship, calculating the number of males per 100 females rather than the standard Sex Ratio. ( Number of females / Total population) x 100 (Option C) : This formula calculates the proportion of females in the total population, not the sex ratio. It is an example of a proportion where the numerator is included in the denominator. Reference: Park’s Textbook of Preventive and Social Medicine, 27th edition, Page 63 .",

      "question": "A town with a population of 10,000 people is experiencing an influenza outbreak. Over the past two weeks, 500 cases have been reported. What is the proportion of the population affected by influenza during these two weeks?",

      "question": "During a food festival in a small town, 200 people attended a barbecue event. Within 48 hours, 60 attendees developed symptoms of food poisoning. Local health officials want to measure the extent of the outbreak among those who attended the event. What is the term used to describe the proportion of people who developed symptoms out of all the attendees?",

      },
      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: A) Attack rate Explanation: The attack rate is the most appropriate measure in this scenario. It represents the proportion of exposed individuals who develop the disease during a specified time period. In this case, we want to measure the extent of food poisoning among those who attended the barbecue event. To calculate the attack rate: Number of new cases / Total number of people at risk × 100 = 60 / 200 × 100 = 30% Secondary attack rate (Option B): This is a measure of commuicability/transmisibility of a disease. It's typically used for person-to-person transmitted diseases, not for a common source outbreak like food poisoning at an event. Case fatality rate (Option C) : This is a measure of severity/virulence of a disease. It is the proportion of individuals who die from a specific disease among those diagnosed with it. It is not applicable here, as we are not provided with death data. We are focused on the extent of the outbreak, not its severity. Prevalence rate (Option D): This measures the proportion of people with a particular condition at a specific time. It's unsuitable for this acute outbreak scenario, as we're interested in new cases that developed after a specific exposure, not the total number of existing cases in the population.
