      "question": "Which statement regarding non-communicable diseases (NCDs) is correct?",
      "options": {
        "A": "NCDs are responsible for the least number of deaths worldwide.",
        "B": "Primordial prevention of NCDs involves early diagnosis and treatment of disease.",

        "D": "Cardiovascular diseases contribute the least to the global DALY."
      },
      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: C) According to the WHO, chronic NCDs have a duration of over three months Diseases: Disability-adjusted life years (DALYs): NCDs are responsible for maximum DALY and deaths worldwide (Option A) . Cardiovascular diseases contribute to maximum DALY (Option D). DALYs represent the total burden of disease, combining years of life lost due to premature death and years lived with disability from the condition. Best Level of Prevention: The best level of prevention for NCDs is primordial prevention. This involves preventing the development of risk factors for NCDs (Option B) . Examples of primordial prevention strategies include promoting healthy diets and physical activity from a young age to prevent obesity and associated NCDs later in life. Chronic NCD Duration: The World Health Organization (WHO) defines a chronic NCD as a disease with a duration of greater than three months (Option C) . This is in contrast to acute diseases, which have a shorter duration.

Explanation: Role of ASHA in NP-NCD: Conducts opportunistic screening of the community for NCDs, including diabetes, risk factors for TB, and other NCDs Uses blood pressure measurement and strip method blood glucose testing to screen individuals over 30 years old for NCDs. Refers suspected cases of diabetes and hypertension to Community Health Centers (CHCs) or higher healthcare facilities for diagnosis and management. Makes home visits to encourage positive behavior modifications, monitor treatment compliance, and encourage patients to attend regular check-ups for blood pressure and blood glucose at sub-centers. Receives I 10 for every Community-Based Assessment Checklist (CBAC) form completed. These forms are used to screen for NCDs, including diabetes, risk factors for TB, and other NCDs. ASHA workers are not qualified to diagnose or initiate treatment for NCDs (Option A). Performing ECGs and other laboratory investigations is beyond the scope of an ASHA worker's role (Option B). They do not provide specialized cancer care or treatment (Option D). Reference: Park’s Textbook of Preventive and Social Medicine, 27th Edition, Page 542.",

      "explanation": "Correct Answer: D) Waist circumference Explanation: Obesity can be defined as abnormal growth of adipose tissue, which may be due to an increase in fat cell size or number. Indicators of obesity: Body weight: BMI (Quetele’s index): weight (kg) / height (m²) Ponderal index: height (cm)/cube root of body weight Broca’s index: height (cm) -100 Corpulence index: Actual weight / desirable weight Lorentz formula: II Though not accurate, body weight is the most commonly used indicator of obesity BMI is the most widely used indicator worldwide. Does not differentiate between fat and muscle mass. Also, does not provide information regarding fat distribution (Option A) . Skinfold thickness: The sum of all four measurements: >40 in males and >50 in females Rapid and non-invasive method for measuring body fat. Measured with Harpenden skin callipers Measurements taken at: mid-triceps, biceps, subscapular and suprailiac regions Measures subcutaneous fat (Option B) Waist circumference: >102 cm in males and >88 cm in females In the Indian population, >90 cm in males and >80 cm in females is considered high risk. Measured at midpoint between the lower border of the rib cage and the iliac crest. Correlates closely with BMI Most commonly used to measure central obesity and its associated risk factors (Option C) Directly related to cardiovascular and other chronic diseases Waist to hip ratio >1 in men and >0.85 in females Correlates with waist circumference There may be some discrepancies as the body fat distribution may be different for each individual (Option D) Reference: Park’s Textbook of Preventive and Social Medicine, 27th Edition, Page 454, 455",

Explanation: Hypertension is a chronic condition defined as an increase in blood pressure. Classification of HTN: Category Systolic BP (mm Hg) Diastolic BP (mm Hg) Optimal <120 <80 Normal <130 <85 High normal 130-139 85-89 Grade I 140-159 (Option A) 90-99 Grade II 160-179 100-109 Hypertensive crisis ≥ 180 >110 Tracking of Hypertension: If blood pressure is tracked from childhood over a period of years, then hypotensive children tend to remain hypotensive in adulthood, and hypertensive children tend to remain hypertensive in adulthood (Option B). This phenomenon is useful in identifying at-risk children and planning for adequate management of HTN. Rules of Halves (Option C): The concept of the \"Rule of Halves\" in hypertension management illustrates that: Approximately 50% of individuals with hypertension are aware of their condition. Among those aware, only about 50% receive treatment. Out of those receiving treatment, approximately 50% have their blood pressure adequately controlled. Lifestyle modifications: Modification Approx.
