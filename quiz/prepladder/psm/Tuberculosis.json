      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: C) Integrated Management of Neonatal and Childhood Illness (IMNCI) watery stools suggest he has diarrhea, and the cough, runny nose, and sore throat suggest he has an Acute Respiratory Infection (ARI). The IMNCI is a strategy that comprehensively manages the most common and serious conditions affecting children under 5 years of age. This includes diseases like ARI (pneumonia) Diarrhea Measles Malaria Malnutrition The Expanded Program on Immunization (EPI) (Option A) is a global initiative that ensures the immunization of all children against common vaccine-preventable diseases. While EPI focuses on vaccination, it does not encompass the broader management of illnesses like pneumonia or malnutrition beyond their prevention through immunization. National Rural Health Mission (NRHM) (Option B) is an Indian initiative designed to improve healthcare delivery across rural areas. While NRHM encompasses various programs and missions, including those targeting maternal and child health, but it is not specifically focused on the integrated management of illnesses like pneumonia and malnutrition in children. National Vector Borne Disease Control Program (NVBDCP) (Option D) focuses on preventing and controlling vector-borne diseases such as malaria, dengue, and chikungunya.",

      "question": "A distressed mother brings her 6-month-old son to the emergency. She complains that he has been refusing to feed, vomiting, and passing frequent loose stools for the past 2 days. He also had a bout of convulsions an hour ago. On examination, the baby is lethargic and difficult to wake. Which among his symptoms is not a danger sign?",

        "C": "Convulsions",
        "D": "Frequent loose stools"
      },
      "correct_answer": "D",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: D) Frequent loose stools Explanation: Under IMNCI, The following are considered to be the danger signs in children under 5 years of age Convulsions Lethargy/unconsciousness Inability to drink/breastfeed Vomiting Urgent referral after starting initiation of first dose of antibiotic is needed in case of severe diseases. While frequent loose stools (Diarrhea) can indicate an issue such as dehydration or infection and should not be ignored, the other symptoms (lethargy and difficulty waking, refusal to feed, and convulsions) are more immediately concerning and are clear danger signs requiring urgent medical attention under the IMNCI act. Lethargy & difficulty in waking (Option A) could indicate severe dehydration, or infection (such as meningitis or sepsis). Refusal to feed (Option B) can quickly lead to dehydration and malnutrition. Convulsions (Option C) indicate abnormal brain activity, which can be due to a variety of causes including high fever (febrile seizures), electrolyte imbalances, infections (like meningitis), or other neurological issues.

      "question": "A mother brings her 10-month-old daughter to the clinic with complaints of refusal to feed and vomiting everything for the past 2 days. On examination, she is lethargic and also has fever. According to the IMNCI color coding system, how should this child be classified?",
      "options": {

        "D": "Orange (Moderate illness)"
      },
      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: C) Pink (Severe illness) Explanation: The IMNCI guidelines use a color-coded system to classify the severity of illness in children. Therefore, if a child has any of the danger signs, he should be classified as PINK (Severe illness) and given an Urgent referral after starting initial treatment. This child is refusing to breastfeed and also vomits everything. Additionally, she is lethargic. All these are danger signs and warrant urgent treatment. Hence, Pink (Severe illness). Green (Mild illness) (Option A) Mild illness typically includes conditions that are not immediately life-threatening and can be managed with home care. This includes children with minor symptoms such as a mild cough without fast breathing or chest indrawing, minor diarrhea without dehydration, and other non-severe conditions. The child in the scenario has signs & symptoms of severe illness. Therefore, the child does not fit into the green category of mild illness. Yellow (Moderate illness) (Option B) Moderate illness includes conditions that require medical treatment but do not necessitate immediate hospital referral. This might include conditions like pneumonia without chest indrawing (fast breathing but no chest indrawing), mild dehydration, and moderate malnutrition. Orange (Moderate illness) (Option D) IMNCI categorizes/color codes moderate Illness as yellow and not orange.",

Hence he would be classified as Very Severe Disease or Severe Pneumonia and a dose of antibiotic should be started and urgently referred to the hospital. Classify as pneumonia and refer urgently to secondary level hospital (Option A) and Classify as pneumonia, start antibiotic, and advise to report after 2 days (Option B): incorrect as they signify “pneumonia” as per the aforementioned table. Classify as severe pneumonia and keep the baby warm ( Option D): correctly classifies it as under severe pneumonia but is partially incorrect as the baby needs to be urgently referred to a hospital.",

      "explanation": "Correct Answer: C) To differentiate between a boosted reaction and a new infection Explanation: Before starting immunosuppressive therapy, a two-step tuberculin skin test (TST) is used to distinguish between a boosted reaction from prior exposure to tuberculosis and a new infection. This approach helps confirm a positive TST result, preventing unnecessary treatment for latent tuberculosis due to misinterpretation. 1st test - read within 48 to 72 hours If positive - consider the patient infected. If negative - 2nd test after 3 weeks. 2nd test - read within 48 to 72 hours - done after 3 weeks.
