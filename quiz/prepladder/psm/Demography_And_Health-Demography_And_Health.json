De facto method De jure method Description This refers to collecting information based on the people's current location at the time of the survey. This method was used in the Indian Census only up to the 1930s This refers to the collection of information based on the individual's legal proof of permanent residency, regardless of where they stay during the survey. The Indian census survey currently uses this method. Example A legal resident of New Delhi may be living and working in Mumbai during the census; thus, if the de facto method is used, his data will be collected during the Mumbai census survey. A legal resident of New Delhi may be living and working in Mumbai during the census; thus, if the de jure method is used, his data will be collected during the New Delhi census survey.

It is defined as the percentage of eligible couples who are effectively protected against childbirth using approved family planning methods such as sterilisation, IUD, condoms, or oral pills. It is a grass root level indicator. Sterilisation represents over 60% of these protected couples. A Net Reproductive rate (NRR) of 1 can be achieved only if the CPR exceeds >60% Age-specific fertility rate (ASFR) (Option A) helps measure the changes in fertility over time in the same population. Still, more is needed to help achieve the target of the national family planning program. The Total Fertility Rate (TFR) (Option B) is the most important indicator in family planning. Still, achieving the national family planning program's target is less important than the couple protection rate. General fertility rate (GFR) (Option C) provides insight into the current fertility patterns and trends within a population, reflecting the overall fertility level regardless of age distribution. However, more is needed to achieve the target of the national family planning program.

To calculate the dependency ratio, we use the formula: No. of people under the age of 15 years = 40 million. No.of people above 65 years = 30 million. No. of people aged 15-65 years = 150 million. Calculation: (40+30)/150 x 100 = 70/150 x100 = 46.7% Reference: Park’s Textbook of Preventive and Social Medicine, 27th edition, page 559",

It signifies the societal challenge of supporting a larger dependent population, which typically occurs due to aging demographics. Demographic Bonus A phase in a nation's demographic evolution in which the proportion of the dependent population relative to the working-age population declines. This is often associated with economic growth opportunities as more people are in the workforce than dependents. Demographic Window: Refers to a period in a nation's demographic structure when the proportion of the population in the working-age group is at its highest. Demographic Dividend: An increase in economic growth driven by a growing proportion of working-age individuals in the population.
