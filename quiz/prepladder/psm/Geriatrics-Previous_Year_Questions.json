      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "bathing can lead to hypothermia and is discouraged right after birth. Instead, the focus should be on keeping the baby warm and starting breastfeeding. Incorrect Options: Option A - Start breastfeeding as early as possible: Early initiation of breastfeeding, ideally within the first hour of birth, is crucial for the baby’s health. It helps with bonding, provides essential nutrients, and supports the infant's immune system. Option B - Cover the baby's head and body: Covering the baby’s head and body immediately after birth is important to prevent heat loss and maintain the baby’s body temperature, especially in rural or resource-limited settings. Option D - Clear eyes with a sterile swab: Clearing the baby’s eyes with a sterile swab helps prevent eye infections, which is part of routine newborn care.",

      },
      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: C) She is susceptible to chickenpox Explanation: Varicella-Zoster Virus (VZV) causes chickenpox (primary infection) and herpes zoster (reactivation). Serum antibodies against VZV indicate prior infection or vaccination. A negative antibody test means she has never had chickenpox nor been vaccinated , making her susceptible to primary varicella infection (chickenpox) . This is particularly concerning in pregnancy, as maternal varicella can lead to congenital varicella syndrome or severe neonatal infection. Varicella Susceptibility and Immunity Serology Interpretation Risk Status Positive VZV IgG Past infection or vaccination Immune to chickenpox Negative VZV IgG No prior exposure Susceptible to chickenpox Positive VZV IgM Recent infection Active chickenpox infection She is immune to zoster (Option A): Incorrect because her negative antibody test means she has never had VZV, so reactivation as zoster is not possible. She is susceptible to zoster (Option B): Incorrect because zoster occurs due to reactivation of prior VZV infection, which she has never had. She is immune to chickenpox (Option D): Incorrect because a negative antibody test indicates no immunity to VZV.

        "D": "After 24 hours"

      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: A) Within 1 hour Explanation: For a primigravida (first-time mother) delivering a healthy baby through normal delivery, it is recommended to initiate breastfeeding within 1 hour after birth. Early initiation of breastfeeding is crucial because: It helps in the initiation of milk production . The baby receives the first milk , known as colostrum , which is rich in nutrients and antibodies, providing essential protection against infections. Early breastfeeding also promotes bonding between the mother and the baby. After 1 hour (Option B): is incorrect because, as per guidelines, the baby should begin breastfeeding within the first hour of birth, not after it. After 4-6 hours (Option C): is incorrect. Delaying breastfeeding for this long can lead to problems like poor milk production and inadequate intake by the baby. After 24 hours (Option D): is incorrect. Waiting for 24 hours is too long, and early breastfeeding is essential for both maternal and infant health. Reference: Park’s Textbook of Preventive and Social Medicine, Edition 26, Page 623, 991",

      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: B) Give a booster dose of Td Explanation: The Td (Tetanus and Diphtheria) vaccine is recommended as a booster dose during pregnancy, especially if the woman has completed the required antenatal vaccinations previously. In India, the current guidelines suggest giving two doses of Td (Tetanus and Diphtheria) during pregnancy: one at the start of pregnancy and one between 20 to 26 weeks . Tetanus Toxoid (TT) is part of routine antenatal immunization, but the Td vaccine is recommended if there is a history of prior TT vaccination in previous pregnancies, as it also covers Diphtheria . Give a booster dose of TT (Option A): is not correct in this context, as the current guidelines recommend Td (Tetanus and Diphtheria) for booster doses, not TT . Give 2 doses of TT (Option C): is incorrect because only a booster dose of Td is needed. Giving 2 doses of TT is not the standard recommendation if the woman has completed required antenatal vaccinations in the previous pregnancy. Give 2 doses of Td (Option D): is not correct because only 1 dose of Td is recommended for the current pregnancy, not two. The second dose of Td is given between 20-26 weeks of pregnancy if the first dose was given early in the pregnancy.

PHCs are responsible for ensuring school health services, including periodic checkups and health education, in their assigned areas. School Health Services 1. History: Bhore Committee: Launched the concept of school health checkups. Renuka Roy Committee: Recommended school health checkups once every 4 years. 2. Current Recommendation: School health checkups are recommended once every 6 months. School Health Administration 1. Responsibility: Primary Health Centres (PHCs): Responsible for school health services in their respective jurisdictions. 2. Coverage: Each Medical Officer should cover 5,000-6,000 children per year. 3. Village Level: School Health Committees can be established to ensure health services at the village level. District hospitals (Option B): are higher-level healthcare facilities that provide secondary level care to the population within a district. They primarily focus on advanced medical care and management of more complex health issues. The sub-center (Option C): Sub-centres provide basic healthcare services at the village level but do not have the capacity to manage school health programs. Sub-divisional hospitals (Option D): also known as taluka hospitals or community health centres, are healthcare facilities at the sub-district level.
