      "question": "The Community medicine department set out to an urban community to raise awareness about the importance of hand hygiene in preventing infectious diseases. As part of the campaign, health educators plan to conduct workshops to educate community members about proper handwashing techniques and their benefits. Which of the following is not a principle of health education?",

      },
      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "education Authoritative teaching often involves one-way communication. This may make the audience feel passive and less engaged. People are more likely to absorb and act on information when they actively participate in the learning process. An authoritarian manner can create a power imbalance and make the audience feel disrespected or mistrusted. Building trust is crucial for effective health education. Principles of health education include: 1. Credibility (option B) 2. Interest (option A) 3. Participation 4. Motivation 5. Comprehension 6. Reinforcement 7. Learning by doing 8. Known to unknown 9. Setting an example 10. Good Human relations 11. Feedback. (option D) 12. Leaders Reference: Park's Textbook of Preventive and Social Medicine, 27th edition, Pg 990",

      "explanation": "to show how to perform a skill or procedure. Here CPR is carried out step by step before the general public and the demonstrator ascertains that the audience understands how to perform it. Reasons why the Demonstration method is highly effective in health education: (a) Dramatizes by arousing interest (b) Persuades the onlookers to adopt recommended practices (c) Upholds the principles of \"seeing is believing\" and \"learning by doing\", and (d) Can bring desirable changes in the behaviour about the use of the new practice. Flashcards: This mode of communication primarily relies on visual information and may not provide the hands-on demonstration required for learning the technique of CPR. (Option A) Lecture: While lectures may be effective for sharing knowledge, they might not be as suitable for demonstrating CPR in a patient with cardiac arrest as lectures will not provide the hands-on experience necessary for understanding the CPR Technique. (Option C) Group Discussion: They are more focused on dialogue and may not provide the practical demonstration needed for performing CPR.

      "explanation": "panel of experts answering questionnaires in multiple rounds to achieve consensus. panel of experts answering questionnaires in multiple rounds to achieve consensus. Explanation: Delphi method is a structured communication method that depends on a panel of experts. It involves gathering opinions from the panel of experts on a specific issue, summarizing their collective feedback, and repeating this process for several rounds. After each round, the experts share their feedback and the reasoning behind their judgements anonymously. This feedback encourages experts to reconsider and potentially revise their earlier opinions based on the responses of other panel members. Through this process, the range of responses tends to narrow, and the group will reach a consensus. The Delphi method does not involve participants discussing the issues (Option A) or natural observation (Option B) or statistical analysis (Option D).
