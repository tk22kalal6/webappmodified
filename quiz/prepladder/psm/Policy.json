      "explanation": "Correct Answer: C) BCG (Bacillus Calmette-Guérin) vaccine Explanation: Vaccination is a primary level of prevention - provides specific protection against diseases, before they occur. Exception is the BCG (Bacillus Calmette-Guérin) vaccine It is used against TB as a primary preventive measure. But, it is also used to treat bladder cancer. It is instilled intravesically Targets existing cancer cells and prevents the progression and recurrence of bladder cancer. Since the BCG vaccine is used for intervention, it is regarded as a secondary level of preventive measure. Hepatitis B vaccine, MMR vaccine, and Influenza vaccine are all used to prevent infections in individuals before they occur, fitting the primary prevention model.

      "question": "A 2-year-old child is brought by his mother. During the consultation, it is revealed that the child has not received any vaccinations since birth due to the family's geographical isolation and lack of access to healthcare services. The healthcare worker is concerned about the child’s susceptibility to vaccine-preventable diseases and advises immediate initiation of the vaccination schedule.

      "correct_answer": "D",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: D) Left out Explanation: Here, the child has not been immunized since birth, so vaccination never reached this child. Hence, he will be classified as a left-out . Fully immunised (Option A): A child who received all due vaccines according to the National Immunisation Schedule (NIS) up to the age of 1 year. Completely immunised (Option B): A child who received all due vaccines according to NIS up to 12 to 23 months of age. Dropouts (Option C): Incomplete complete immunisation.

      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: C) Rotavirus vaccine Explanation: Live attenuated vaccines contain weakened forms of pathogens that can replicate within the host and are contraindicated in pregnancy. A live organism is injected into the body in attenuated form. Attenuated form means that we have reduced the organism's virulence (killing power), but immunogenicity (antibody-producing capacity) is maintained. The rotavirus vaccine is an example of a live attenuated vaccine designed to provide immunity against rotavirus infections. Comparison of Live and Killed Vaccines: Live Vaccines Killed Vaccines Injected in live, attenuated (weakened) form Injected in killed form A single dose is sufficient (except OPV) Multiple doses are needed Longer duration of immunity Shorter duration of immunity Contraindicated in pregnancy, radiation therapy, and severe symptomatic immunodeficiency. It can be given during pregnancy Examples: Mnemonic - I love Chick EMBRYO Live Influenza, Chickenpox (Varicella), Live JE vaccine, MR, BCG, Rotavirus, Yellow fever virus, OPV.

Disadvantage - serotype specific immune response since the capsular polysaccharides vary between different strains. Polysaccharide-based vaccines are available against 23 serotypes of S.pneumoniae, Hib, Neisseria meningitidis, and Salmonella typhimurium.

      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: B) DPT Vaccine is unsafe in children with Spina bifida Explanation: DPT is safe for children with Spina bifida. DPT is contraindicated in progressive neurological diseases due to its pertussis component, anaphylaxis to the previous dose, and encephalopathy within 7 days of vaccination attributed to no other cause. Post-vaccine fever, inconsolable cry within 48 hours, and seizures within 72 hours of vaccine are relative contraindications of DPT. Spina Bifida is a birth defect where there is incomplete closing of the backbone and membranes around the spinal cord. It is a non-progressive neurological condition. Hence DPT is safe in such patients. All live vaccines are contraindicated in pregnancy except the yellow fever vaccine (Option A) as the infection's risk outweighs the live vaccine's risk. All Live vaccines are contraindicated in patients on corticosteroids (Option C) since their immune response is suppressed. All vaccines except MMR, measles, rubella & varicella are contraindicated in adults with symptomatic HIV (Option D) whereas none are contraindicated in asymptomatic HIV patients.

      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: A) Administer the measles vaccine immediately. Explanation: In a disaster scenario, all vaccines are contraindicated for victims except the measles vaccine, which can be administered within 3 days of exposure to a confirmed case. This is because measles has a natural incubation period of 10-14 days, and antibodies can be produced after vaccination within 7 to 10 days, which can help in preventing the disease and its outbreak. Typhoid and cholera vaccines (Option B) are not given to all because the time needed to produce antibodies is longer than the natural incubation period of these diseases. In a disaster situation, immediate protection is crucial, and these vaccines do not offer quick enough protection to be beneficial in the acute phase. OPV (Option C) is not indicated in this scenario unless there is an outbreak of polio- in which case OPV is given to at least 500 children in the vicinity.

Therefore, the statement that the vaccine can still be used is wrong. VVM is only used to detect the potency of vaccine and it has nothing to do with expiry. If the vaccine is expired, it has to be discarded irrespective of the colour changes on VVM. The VVM is indeed a heat-sensitive chemical indicator that is placed on the vial, ampule, or cap to monitor the vaccine's exposure to heat. (Option A) The VVM changes color gradually to indicate the cumulative exposure of the vaccine to heat over time.

To maintain immunity against type 3 components, it is retained in bOPV. This statement is false because the Switch involved the removal of wpv2, not wpv1, from the vaccine formulation (Option A) This is also a false statement because the Switch was prompted by the eradication of wpv2 in 2015, not wpv3 (which was eradicated later in October 2019) (Option B) IPV was introduced before the switch (in 2014-2015) to help maintain immunity against polio, particularly against the type 2 component (Option D)",
