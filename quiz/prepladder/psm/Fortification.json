      "explanation": "Correct answer: B) Nausea, repeated vomiting, giddiness, and drowsiness Explanation: The acute symptoms of Ergotism include nausea, repeated vomiting, giddiness, and drowsiness lasting up to 24 to 48 hours. Ergotism: Ergot is a fungus (Claviceps purpurea) that infects food grains such as bajra, rye, sorghum, and wheat during their flowering stages. Consumption of ergot-infested grains can lead to ergotism , characterised by acute symptoms such as nausea, repeated vomiting, giddiness, and drowsiness lasting up to 24 to 48 hours. In chronic cases, ergotism may cause painful cramps in limbs and peripheral gangrene due to vasoconstriction of capillaries. Modern high-yielding varieties of bajra are more susceptible to ergot infestation. Infested grains can be removed in 20% salt water, hand-picking, or air floatation. The upper safe limit for ergot alkaloids in food material is 0.05 mg per 100 grams. Reference: Park’s Textbook of Preventive and Social Medicine, 27th edition, page 772",

Shakir’s tape: MUAC tapes measure the upper arm circumference of children and pregnant women to identify malnutrition. There are different types of MUAC tapes, all graduated in millimetres. Some tapes are colour-coded (red, yellow, green) to indicate nutritional status. MUAC tapes are used to assess nutritional status quickly and non-invasively, aiding in timely intervention for malnutrition. MUAC tapes for children and adults are available through UNICEF Supply Division warehouses. It cannot be used for infants.

      },
      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Correct answer: C) Presence of nutritional oedema Explanation: Severe Acute Malnutrition (SAM) can be defined by: Very low weight-for-height/length (Z-score below -3SD). A mid-upper arm circumference <115 mm. The presence of nutritional oedema. SAM significantly increases the risk of death in children under five years of age. It can indirectly cause child death by increasing the case fatality rate in children suffering from common illnesses such as diarrhoea and pneumonia. Children who are severely wasted (SAM) are 9 times more likely to die than well-nourished children. MUAC >115 mm (Option A): SAM is defined by MUAC <115 mm , not above. Weight-for-age Z-score below -1 SD (Option B): This is not used for SAM diagnosis. Weight-for-age < -2 SD defines underweight , not SAM. Height-for-age Z-score below -2 SD (Option D): This defines stunting , a sign of chronic malnutrition, not acute malnutrition .

      "explanation": "Correct answer: C) Weight for height Explanation: Low weight for age Underweight Both chronic & acute malnutrition. Low height for age Stunting Chronic malnutrition Low weight for height Wasting Acute malnutrition Underweight: Used to assess changes in malnutrition over time; reflects both chronic & acute malnutrition. It is commonly used as a population health indicator since weight is easy to measure. Weight-for-age Z-score at least 2SD below the WHO Child Growth Standards median. Stunting: Reflects growth retardation due to a chronic aetiology (chronic inadequate nutrition or recurrent infections). Usually, it causes delayed psycho-social and cognitive development and poor school performance. Height-for-age Z-score at least 2SD below the WHO Child Growth Standards median. Wasting: Recent failure to receive adequate nutrition results in weight loss or failure to gain weight. Indicates acute malnutrition affected by recent illnesses like diarrhoea and acute food shortages. Rapid changes in individuals and populations are influenced by seasonal food availability and disease prevalence. Weight-for-height Z-score at least -2 SD below the median of WHO Child Growth Standards. Reference: Park’s Textbook of Preventive and Social Medicine, 27th edition, pages 754-755",
