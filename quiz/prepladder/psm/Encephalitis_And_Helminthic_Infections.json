      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Correct answer: C) Japanese Encephalitis; IgM ELISA Explanation : Given the patient's symptoms and lack of vaccination, Japanese encephalitis is the most likely diagnosis. The investigation of choice for confirming JE is the IgM ELISA test for the JE virus, which detects specific antibodies in the patient's serum or cerebrospinal fluid. Japanese encephalitis Incubation Period 5-15 days Symptoms Mild: fever and headache Severe: high fever, headache, neck stiffness, seizures, coma Case Fatality Rate 20-30% in severe cases Long-term Sequelae Neurological and psychiatric sequelae in 30-50% of survivors Diagnosis Serological tests (IgM ELISA), PCR Bacterial meningitis (Option A) can cause similar symptoms (fever, headache, neck stiffness), and the specific epidemiological context (rice fields and pig farms) and season (monsoon) strongly suggest Japanese encephalitis. Blood cultures are also less specific for CNS infections than CSF analysis and PCR. HSV encephalitis (Option B) can present with similar symptoms, but given the epidemiological context (rice fields and pig farms during monsoon season), it is less likely. The symptoms are more indicative of Japanese encephalitis. Dengue fever (Option D) commonly presents with high fever, severe headache, retro-orbital pain, myalgia, arthralgia, and sometimes a rash. However, it does not typically cause neck stiffness or altered mental status indicative of central nervous system involvement. Additionally, while dengue is prevalent in monsoon seasons, the specific history of living near rice fields and pig farms is more indicative of Japanese encephalitis.

        "D": "Presence of monkeys in the area"
      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Correct answer: B) Temperature of climate ranging 18-24°C Explanation: Yellow fever transmission is less likely in cooler temperatures. Aedes mosquitoes thrive in warmer climates, typically between 24-36°C. Therefore, a climate with temperatures ranging from 18-24°C is unsuitable for transmitting yellow fever. Yellow fever Agent and Vector Flavivirus transmitted primarily by mosquitoes Aedes Mosquito (in urban settings) Haemagogus (in jungle or forested areas) Hosts Primarily monkeys (Reservoir hosts) Humans are (Incidental hosts) and can develop severe disease. Environmental Features Found in tropical and subtropical areas of Africa and South America, where mosquito vectors are prevalent. Transmission occurs primarily in forested or jungle areas. Typical Conditions: Temperature: 24-36’C Humidity: >60% Clinical Presentation Initial symptoms (acute phase, 3-6 days post-infection): fever, chills, headache, backache, muscle aches, loss of appetite. Severe cases (toxic phase): jaundice, bleeding, organ dysfunction (liver, kidney). Diagnosis Based on clinical signs Travel history to endemic areas Confirmed by detection of YFV RNA or specific antibodies (IgM and IgG) in blood samples. High humidity levels (>60%) (Option A) create favourable conditions for the breeding and activity of mosquitoes, including the Aedes species responsible for yellow fever transmission. Aedes mosquitoes (Option C) , transmit the virus through their bites, making this parameter crucial for the transmission of yellow fever. Monkeys (Option D) serve as natural hosts for the yellow fever virus in sylvatic (jungle) cycles. Their presence indicates the potential for the virus to circulate in the environment, with mosquitoes acting as vectors to transmit it to humans.
