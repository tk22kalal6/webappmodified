      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "months Correct Answer: B) Shorter TPT (TB Preventive Therapy) - Rifapentine + Isoniazid Daily for 3 months Explanation: Close household contacts of a patient with active tuberculosis are at high risk of developing TB, especially elderly and immunocompromised individuals. TB Preventive Therapy (TPT) is recommended for these contacts after ruling out active disease. Short-course regimens such as weekly Rifapentine + Isoniazid for 3 months (3HP) are WHO-endorsed , effective, and improve compliance. Particularly beneficial in resource-limited and high-burden settings due to shorter duration and fewer side effects. TB Preventive Therapy (TPT) Options Regimen Drugs Used Duration Target Groups Notes 3HP Isoniazid + Rifapentine (weekly) 3 months Adults and children >2 years, PLHIV, household contacts WHO-recommended; shorter duration improves adherence 6H Isoniazid daily 6 months All age groups, including children and PLHIV Traditional regimen; effective but lower adherence due to long duration 3HR Isoniazid + Rifampicin daily 3 months Children <15 years, PLHIV, household contacts WHO-recommended; safe for children 4R Rifampicin daily 4 months Individuals intolerant to INH, or where INH resistance is suspected Alternative regimen when INH is contraindicated Isoniazid (600 mg OD) for 6 months (Option A): Correct regimen (6H) but longer duration and more hepatotoxicity; 3HP is preferred. Pyrizinamide (800 mg OD) for 3 months (Option C): Incorrect. Pyrazinamide is not used in TPT due to significant hepatotoxicity and lack of preventive efficacy when used alone. Rifampicin (1500 mg OD) for 9 months (Option D): Incorrect. 9 months of Rifampicin monotherapy is not a standard TPT regimen; usual Rifampicin-only TPT is 4 months (4R) .",

This test is generally used for detecting specific drug resistances (like rifampicin and isoniazid) in previously confirmed TB cases and not for the primary diagnosis. Diagnostic Modality Description Usage Sputum Smear Microscopy Microscopic examination of sputum samples to detect acid-fast bacilli (AFB). Used for initial screening and diagnosis, especially in resource-limited settings. Chest X-ray Imaging done to identify abnormalities suggestive of TB. Used to support diagnosis when clinical suspicion is high; not definitive for TB diagnosis. TruNAAT/CBNAAT Molecular tests that detect Mycobacterial DNA and rifampicin resistance. Recommended for initial diagnosis due to high sensitivity and specificity; rapid results. Line Probe Assay (LPA) Molecular test to detect specific genetic mutations associated with drug resistance (e.g., rifampicin, isoniazid). Used for detecting drug resistance in confirmed TB cases, not for initial diagnosis. Tuberculin Skin Test (TST) A skin test to measure immune response to injected tuberculin protein. Primarily used for screening latent TB infection; not specific for active TB diagnosis. Interferon-Gamma Release Assays (IGRAs) Blood cytokine analysis test that measures immune response to TB antigens. Used for detecting latent TB infection Sputum Culture Growing Mycobacteria from sputum samples to confirm TB and test for drug susceptibility. Gold standard for TB diagnosis; takes several weeks to obtain results. Drug Susceptibility Testing (DST) Testing TB bacteria from patient samples to determine resistance to TB drugs.

      "correct_answer": "D",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: D) Recurrent TB case Explanation: This patient's case should be categorized as a \"Recurrent TB case\" because she had previously completed a full course of TB treatment and was declared cured. According to the NTEP classification, a recurrent TB case includes patients who were previously treated for TB, declared cured or treatment completed, and are now diagnosed with a recurrent episode of TB. Classification of TB Patients based on History of Treatment Category Description New case (Option A) Newly diagnosed case and has never taken TB treatment before/taken treatment for <1 month duration. Previously treated case Taken TB treatment earlier for >1 month. Recurrent TB case TB patient declared cured or treatment complete, presents again as a microbiologically confirmed TB case. Treatment after failure (Option B) TB patient who had been treated for TB & presents as a failure at the most recent course of treatment or is positive even at 5 months of treatment. Treatment after loss to follow up (Option C) A TB patient who received treatment for >1 month & registered as loss to follow up, is presenting again as a microbiologically positive TB case. Other previously treated patients Earlier treatment is not known or not documented. Transferred in Treatment starts at one TB unit, then the patient is transferred to another TB unit. Cure : Treatment is complete + sputum negative report at the end of the treatment. Treatment complete: Treatment is complete + sputum report is not available Reference: Park's Textbook of Preventive and Social Medicine, 27th Edition, Page 211",

      "correct_answer": "D",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: D) Presumptive TB case Explanation: The patient should be categorized as a \" Presumptive TB case \" according to NTEP's new terminologies as the patient is showing cough, fever or night sweats & apparent loss in weight for more than 2 weeks . The term Presumptive TB case is used in place of TB suspect (Option B) and refers to individuals who show symptoms suggestive of TB but have not yet been confirmed with a diagnosis. This term is crucial for early identification and screening of TB cases to initiate timely diagnosis and treatment. The new NTEP changes in terminologies are as follows: Category Description Criteria/Features Presumptive TB Case Used in place of TB suspect . Individuals showing symptoms suggestive of TB but not yet confirmed. Cough, Fever, Night sweats +- Weight loss > 2 weeks Clinically Diagnosed TB Case (Option A) Sputum negative but with high clinical suspicion of TB. Used in place of Sputum negative TB case. (Option C) Persistent symptoms despite negative sputum smear High clinical suspicion based on symptoms, radiological and histological features Bacteriologically Confirmed TB Case Biological specimen is positive for sputum AFB and/or CBNAAT. Used in place of Sputum positive TB case. Positive sputum smear for AFB Positive CBNAAT test confirming the presence of TB bacteria Reference: Park's Textbook of Preventive and Social Medicine, 27th Edition, Pages 210-211",

ASHA workers receive an incentive of Rs. 500 for finding a presumptive case. Any member in the community helping in the identification of presumptive TB cases gets an incentive of Rs. 500. Intensified case finding: Provider initiated screening for TB symptoms in OPD. TB screening of patients presenting to health facilities with other comorbidities. Community based screening: ASHA workers fill a community based assessment checklist (CBAC) form, asking the risk factors for diabetes and other non communicable diseases along with TB. She gets Rs. 10 per form filled. Passive case detection: Passive surveillance from the hospital reports.
