      },
      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer C - 40 days The term \"quarantine\" originates from the Italian word \"quaranta,\" meaning 40 . In the 14th century, during the outbreak of the bubonic plague, authorities in maritime cities like Venice implemented a rule that ships arriving from infected ports had to anchor for 40 days before passengers and crew could disembark. This 40-day isolation period was chosen for religious and practical reasons, as it was believed to be long enough to determine whether someone had the disease. Public health strategies: Isolation separates individuals who are already ill and potentially infectious from others for the maximum period of communicability to prevent disease spread. It can occur either in healthcare facilities or at home, depending on illness severity and resource availability. It is a defensive strategy. Quarantine separates and restricts the movement of individuals exposed to a contagious disease for a maximum known incubation period, but not yet symptomatic to monitor for symptoms and prevent potential disease spread upon becoming infectious. Isolation and quarantine are examples of primary prevention. Social distancing is a public health measure involving maintaining physical distance and avoiding crowded places or gatherings. It aims to prevent the transmission of infectious diseases but applies broadly, not specifically to individuals already ill. Contact tracing is the process of identifying and monitoring individuals in close contact with an infected person. It is used to identify potential secondary cases and implement appropriate measures, such as quarantine or testing, to prevent further transmission.

In the scenario, the worker regularly collects blood smears for malaria surveillance, indicating proactive data collection. Surveillance is the systematic collection, analysis, and interpretation of health data to plan, implement, and evaluate public health practice. Types: Passive Surveillance: relies on routine reporting from healthcare providers or institutions without additional efforts to enhance reporting (Option C) Active Surveillance involves proactive data collection, where health authorities actively search for cases of diseases.

Tuberculosis: By ASHA (Accredited Social Health Activist) worker Sentinel Surveillance involves monitoring a specific subset of the population or healthcare facilities representing the larger population. E.g., HIV/AIDS screening done in ANC, Blood banks, and STD Clinics (Option A) Syndromic surveillance monitors non-specific health indicators or syndromes (e.g., fever surveillance for malaria, cough for 2w for TB, Flu symptoms for COVID) to detect potential outbreaks or public health emergencies early, analyzing symptom data patterns.

      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: B) Primary prevention Explanation: The government's plan to outline tobacco control laws is considered primary prevention because the laws are intended to prevent the initiation of tobacco use and thereby reduce the risk of diseases associated with tobacco use, such as cancer, heart disease, and respiratory conditions. Primary prevention focuses on reducing risk factors before any disease or injury occurs. Tobacco control laws aim to prevent the onset of smoking-related health problems by discouraging the use of tobacco. Primordial prevention (Option A): is incorrect because primordial prevention focuses on preventing the development of risk factors in the first place, like promoting a healthy environment or addressing social determinants. While tobacco control laws aim to prevent smoking, they are more specifically aimed at reducing existing risk factors (tobacco use), making primary prevention a more accurate term. Secondary prevention (Option C): is incorrect because secondary prevention focuses on early detection and intervention after the risk factors have been established. Tobacco control laws, however, aim to prevent the risk factor (tobacco use) from even emerging. Tertiary prevention (Option D): is incorrect because tertiary prevention deals with management and rehabilitation of individuals who already have diseases or conditions, which is not the focus of tobacco control laws. These laws are intended to prevent the occurrence of tobacco-related diseases in the first place. Reference: Park’s Textbook of Preventive and Social Medicine, Edition 26, Page 48, 49",

      "explanation": "Correct Answer: B) Primary prevention Explanation: Handwashing during COVID-19 is a form of primary prevention because it aims to prevent the onset of illness by reducing the risk of infection . Primary prevention involves actions taken to prevent the occurrence of disease or injury before it happens, and hand hygiene is an effective strategy to reduce transmission of the virus. Primordial prevention (Option A): is incorrect because primordial prevention focuses on preventing the emergence of risk factors for disease, such as promoting healthy behaviors in early childhood or ensuring access to a healthy environment. Handwashing is a more immediate preventive measure rather than an early-stage intervention. Secondary prevention (Option C): is incorrect because secondary prevention focuses on early detection and screening for disease, as well as early intervention to reduce the severity or complications of an already established disease. Handwashing prevents disease transmission, not early disease detection. Tertiary prevention (Option D): is incorrect because tertiary prevention deals with the management and rehabilitation of individuals with already established diseases to prevent further complications and improve quality of life. Handwashing is not related to disease management but to prevention. Reference: Park’s Textbook of Preventive and Social Medicine, Edition 26, Page 48, 49.",

Example: If a 30-year-old dies, potentially losing 45 years of life (assuming a life expectancy of 75). YPLL is a mortality indicator, less sensitive in developed nations with better disease control. Mortality indicators: Crude death rate CDR = (Total no. or deaths in a community/ MYP (Mid-year population) in the same area) x 100 The mid-year population is taken on 1st July Limitation: It does not consider the age and sex of the population Age-specific death rate ASDR = (Total no. of deaths in a particular age group (eg. 20-24yrs) a given area in a year/ MYP of the age group in the same area and year) x 1000 Expectation of life Life expectancy at birth: A positive mortality indicator· Average no. of years a newborn is expected to live, considering the current age-specific mortality rates in a community.

      "explanation": "regular combined oral contraceptive pills (birth control pills) as an emergency contraceptive. While some regular birth control pills can be used as emergency contraception, the regimen described here is not a recommended or standard approach. Emergency contraception should involve specific doses of emergency contraceptive pills (like levonorgestrel or ulipristal) taken within the specified time frame. Regular birth control pills taken in this manner may not provide the same level of effectiveness as dedicated emergency contraceptive pills. Therefore, this option is not a recommended method of emergency contraception. Incorrect Options: Option A - LNG 0.75 mg 2 tab: LNG (Levonorgestrel) is a progestin-only emergency contraceptive pill commonly known as the \"morning-after pill\" or \"Plan B.\" It is effective at preventing pregnancy when taken within a specific time frame after unprotected intercourse. The correct dosage is to take 1.5 mg of LNG (either as a single 1.5 mg tablet or two 0.75 mg tablets) as soon as possible after unprotected intercourse. This option is indeed an emergency contraceptive. Option B - Ethinylestradiol tablet: Ethinylestradiol is a synthetic form of the hormone estrogen, and it is commonly used in combination with progestin as a component of oral contraceptive pills (birth control pills). Option C - Ulipristal T: Ulipristal acetate is a selective progesterone receptor modulator that is used as an emergency contraceptive. It can be taken up to 120 hours (5 days) after unprotected intercourse and is more effective than levonorgestrel when taken closer to the end of the recommended time frame. So, option C is indeed an emergency contraceptive. Reference: Ref: Park’s textbook of preventive medicine, edition: 25",

      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "several factors need to be considered, including effectiveness, convenience, safety, and personal preferences. While the choice ultimately depends on the couple's specific needs and circumstances, oral contraceptive pills (OCPs) are often a suitable option for many couples. OCPs (Oral Contraceptive Pills): OCPs are a highly effective form of contraception when used correctly. They provide reliable pregnancy prevention, are convenient to use, and have additional benefits such as regulating menstrual cycles, reducing menstrual pain, and improving acne. OCPs can be started immediately and discontinued when the couple decides to conceive. Incorrect Options: Option B: Condoms: Condoms are a barrier method of contraception that provide protection against both unintended pregnancies and sexually transmitted infections (STIs). They are easily accessible, affordable, and do not require a prescription. Condoms can be a good option for couples who prefer non-hormonal methods or need STI protection in addition to contraception. However, they may have a higher failure rate compared to hormonal methods like OCPs. Option C: Sterilization: Sterilization, such as tubal ligation for women or vasectomy for men, is a permanent method of contraception. It is considered a long-term and highly effective option for couples who have completed their desired family size or do not wish to have biological children. Sterilization should be approached as a permanent decision, as reversal procedures are costly and not always successful. Option D: IUD (Intrauterine Device): IUDs are long-acting reversible contraceptives that offer highly effective contraception for an extended period. They can be a suitable choice for couples who desire long-term contraception without the need for daily or frequent user involvement. However, IUDs require a healthcare provider's insertion, which may not be immediately accessible for a newly married couple. Reference: .",

      },
      "correct_answer": "D",
      "explanation": "to achieve an NRR of 1. While the exact required rate may vary depending on other factors, a couple protection rate exceeding 60% is generally necessary to achieve replacement-level fertility and an NRR of 1. NRR, or Net Reproduction Rate, is a measure used to estimate the average number of daughters that would be born to a woman over her lifetime, given the prevailing age-specific fertility rates. An NRR of 1 indicates that the population is replacing itself, with each generation being replaced by an equal number of offspring. To achieve an NRR of 1, it is necessary to have a couple protection rate that exceeds a certain threshold. The couple protection rate refers to the percentage of couples using effective contraception to prevent pregnancy. The higher the couple protection rate, the more effectively pregnancies are prevented, leading to a lower total fertility rate and potentially achieving an NRR of 1. Incorrect Options: Option A: 50%- This option suggests that a couple protection rate of 50% is required to reach an NRR of 1. However, this is not accurate. A couple protection rate of 50% might not be sufficient to achieve replacement-level fertility and an NRR of 1. Option B: 40%- This option suggests that a couple protection rate of 40% is needed to reach an NRR of 1. However, this is not correct. A couple protection rate of 40% might still be insufficient to achieve the desired replacement-level fertility. Option C: 70%- This option suggests that a couple protection rate of 70% is necessary to reach an NRR of 1. However, this is not accurate. While a higher couple protection rate increases the likelihood of achieving replacement-level fertility, a rate of 70% may be higher than what is required to reach an NRR of 1",

      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: B) It appeals to emotions Explanation: Health propaganda is designed to influence or persuade people’s attitudes, beliefs, and behaviors regarding health-related issues. It typically appeals to emotions rather than logic, aiming to evoke strong feelings to drive action, such as fear, empathy, or excitement. It is actively acquired (Option A): is incorrect because health propaganda is often passively received through media, advertisements, and campaigns, rather than being actively sought out by the audience. It is behavior centered (Option C): is incorrect because health propaganda doesn’t primarily focus on modifying behavior directly but rather on altering perceptions or attitudes through emotional appeal. It aids in developing a reflective behavior (Option D): is incorrect because health propaganda tends to focus on immediate emotional responses rather than encouraging reflective, thoughtful behavior change that requires deeper cognitive engagement.

      "explanation": "communication method that depends on a panel of experts. It involves gathering opinions from the panel of experts on a specific issue, summarizing their collective feedback, and repeating this process for several rounds. After each round, the experts share their feedback and the reasoning behind their judgements anonymously. This feedback encourages experts to reconsider and potentially revise their earlier opinions based on the responses of other panel members. Through this process, the range of responses tends to narrow, and the group will reach a consensus. The Delphi method does not involve participants discussing the issues or natural observation or statistical analysis. Incorrect Options Television (Option A): It is a medium for broadcasting information and entertainment to a wide audience (mass communication). It is not a structured method for gathering agreement or predictions from a group. Instead, it is typically one-way communication with no direct feedback mechanism to facilitate consensus. GATHER approach (Option B): It is employed in family planning counseling to offer supportive communication to clients when choosing contraceptive methods. Conferences (Option C): They are gatherings where individuals present ideas, research, and discussions. While they allow for the exchange of information and networking, they are not specifically designed to achieve structured consensus or gather collective predictions systematically.

      "correct_answer": "D",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer D - Demonstration The best method is to tell them the technique by showing them the technique. The demonstration is also known as two-way or Socratic communication. It relies on the principle of \"Seeing is believing and learning by doing.\" It is one of the most efficient behavior change methods because it involves 'community participation.' Demonstration: is the best method for teaching practical skills, especially in low-literacy or semi-literate communities. It allows individuals to see how ORS is prepared and used, making it easy to understand and replicate. Visual and hands-on learning are highly effective for retention, especially when dealing with health practices like mixing the correct proportions of water, salt, and sugar for ORS. Reasons why the Demonstration method is highly effective in health education: (a) dramatizes by arousing interest (b) persuades the onlookers to adopt recommended practices (c) upholds the principles of \"seeing is believing\" and \"learning by doing\", and (d) can bring desirable changes m the behavior about the use of the new practice. Lecture (Option A): Less engaging, especially in communities with lower literacy or interest in theoretical teaching. Roleplay (Option B): Useful for Life saving skills, but less practical for teaching step-by-step processes like preparing ORS.

A physician should prioritize clear, open, and empathetic communication, which is especially important in a diverse cultural and linguistic setting like India. The physician should consider the patient’s religion and cultural perception : Understanding and respecting a patient’s cultural and religious background is essential in providing holistic care. This consideration helps in building trust and in making informed decisions that align with the patient's values and beliefs, which can lead to better treatment outcomes. 1, 2 (Option A) : While insisting on good communication is essential, insisting on communication only via an interpreter may not always be the most effective approach, especially when interpreters are not available or when direct communication is possible in a shared language. It is better to attempt direct communication or use an interpreter when necessary rather than relying exclusively on one method. 2, 3 (Option B) : Insisting on communication via an interpreter and treating patients regardless of their cultural perceptions may not be ideal. Ignoring cultural perceptions can lead to misunderstandings and hinder the development of a good patient-physician relationship, which can negatively impact treatment outcomes. 3, 4 (Option C) : Treating patients regardless of cultural perceptions contradicts the idea of respecting the patient’s religion and cultural perceptions , which are crucial for effective care. Ignoring cultural perceptions can lead to suboptimal treatment and may even harm the patient’s trust in the healthcare system.

      "explanation": "key indicator used to measure maternal health and assess the risk of maternal death during pregnancy, childbirth, or within 42 days after the end of pregnancy. It is expressed as the number of maternal deaths per 100,000 live births. Incorrect Options: Option A. (Maternal deaths per 100 live births) is not as accurate because it does not account for the larger scale of live births, which makes it difficult to compare MMR between different populations. Option B. (Maternal deaths per 10,000 live births) is also not the best choice because it overestimates the MMR by using a smaller denominator (10,000) compared to option C. Option D. (Maternal deaths per 1,000 live births) is not appropriate either because it underestimates the MMR by using a larger denominator (1,000) compared to option C. Therefore, option C, which represents the MMR as maternal deaths per 100,000 live births, provides the most accurate and widely used representation of this indicator.",

      "explanation": "focused on the National Malaria Eradication Programme, did not specifically recommend one PHC for every 50,000 population. Instead, its recommendations were more focused on integrating malaria eradication activities into general health services, particularly at the PHC level. The exact recommended ratio of PHCs to population was not mentioned in the committee's report. Incorrect Options Option A: PHC at block level The Chadha Committee did recommend the establishment of PHCs at the block level. This recommendation was aimed at decentralizing healthcare and improving access to primary health services across different regions. Option C: One basic health worker per 10,000 population The Chadha Committee suggested having one basic health worker per 10,000 population to ensure that there were enough healthcare providers available at the grassroots level to carry out primary healthcare services effectively. Option D: Responsibility of PHCs in malaria eradication The Chadha Committee emphasized the role of PHCs in the National Malaria Eradication Programme, assigning them responsibilities in the detection, treatment, and prevention of malaria. This integration was part of the broader strategy to utilize existing healthcare infrastructure for disease control programs. Reference: ..",

      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "expired tablets and pharmaceuticals, needs to be disposed of properly to prevent environmental contamination and health hazards. The correct method for the disposal of expired tablets is incineration, which ensures complete destruction of the pharmaceutical substances. Yellow bag - incineration: Yellow bags or containers are used for the collection of biomedical waste that requires incineration. This waste includes pharmaceuticals, chemicals, and other hazardous materials. Incineration is a high-temperature process that destroys the drugs, reducing the chance of environmental contamination. Incorrect Options: Option A. Red bag - hydroclaving: Red bags typically signify medical waste that is potentially infectious. Hydroclaving is a method that uses high-pressure steam to sterilize infectious waste, but it may not be the ideal method for pharmaceutical disposal, especially for large quantities like expired tablets. Option B. Blue bag - incineration: Blue bags are often used for recyclable materials. Incineration is the correct method for pharmaceutical disposal, but blue bags are not typically associated with biomedical waste disposal. Option D. Yellow bag - burial: Burial of pharmaceuticals or biomedical waste is not a recommended or acceptable method of disposal due to the risk of groundwater contamination and environmental pollution.
