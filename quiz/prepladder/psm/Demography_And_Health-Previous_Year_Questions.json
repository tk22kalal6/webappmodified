      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: A) Infant mortality rate Explanation: Infant mortality rate is not directly included in the Global Hunger Index . While it is closely related to hunger and malnutrition, it specifically refers to the death of infants under 1 year, whereas the GHI focuses on the broader effects of malnutrition, child undernourishment, and under-5 mortality. Global Hunger Index (GHI): The Global Hunger Index (GHI) is a comprehensive tool designed to assess and track hunger worldwide. It incorporates four key indicators that represent various dimensions of hunger: Components of the Global Hunger Index Undernourishment Definition : Measures the percentage of the population whose caloric intake is insufficient to meet the minimum dietary energy requirements. Significance : Reflects overall food access and availability in a population, indicating widespread nutritional insufficiency. Child Stunting Definition : The proportion of children under five years old who have low height for their age, signifying chronic undernutrition. Significance : Highlights the impact of long-term nutritional deficiencies and food insecurity, especially among children. Child Wasting Definition : The percentage of children under five who have low weight for their height, indicating acute undernutrition. Significance : Suggests a recent and severe shortage of food intake or a high incidence of disease, often due to factors like food scarcity or poor health conditions. Child Mortality Definition : The mortality rate of children under five years old. Significance : Reflects the combination of poor nutrition, inadequate healthcare, and environmental conditions, indicating the overall health and well-being of a population. Scoring System The GHI score is on a 100-point scale, with lower scores indicating better nutritional status. The classification is as follows: Low : ≤ 9.9 Moderate : 10.0 - 19.9 Serious : 20.0 - 34.9 Alarming : 35.0 - 49.9 Extremely alarming : ≥ 50.0 A higher score indicates a higher level of hunger severity, while a lower score reflects a better situation regarding food security and child nutrition. 2023 GHI Highlights Global Score : 18.3, categorized as moderate hunger. This is a marginal improvement from 19.1 in 2015. Undernourishment : The number of undernourished individuals rose from 572 million (2015) to approximately 735 million in 2023. Most Affected Regions : South Asia and Africa South of the Sahara both scored 27.0, indicating serious hunger . Alarming Hunger Levels : Seen in 9 countries , including Yemen and Burundi. Under-5 mortality rate (Option B) : This measures the number of children who die before reaching the age of 5 per 1,000 live births. It serves as an indicator of both health and hunger-related issues. Percentage of undernourished population (Option C ) : This indicator measures the proportion of a population whose caloric intake is insufficient to meet daily energy requirements. Percentage of undernourished children under 5 years (Option D) : This reflects the proportion of children under 5 who suffer from chronic malnutrition or undernourishment.

        "B": "Females are less than 500",

        "D": "Females are less than 5000"
      },
      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer C - Males are less than 5000 The sex ratio is defined as the number of females per 1000 males in a given population. A sex ratio of more than 1000 indicates that there are more females than males in the population. For a population of 10,000: If the sex ratio is greater than 1000, it implies that the number of females exceeds the number of males. This means that the number of males must be less than half of the total population (i.e., less than 5000). Sex Ratio : Number of females per 1000 males. Importance in Demography : Crucial for understanding population dynamics. Influencing Factors : Mortality differences between genders. Sex-selective migration. Sex ratio at birth. Implications of Low Sex Ratio : Indicates a preference for male children. Results in gender inequities. This leads to neglect of girls, higher female mortality in youth, female infanticide, and foeticide. Increases maternal mortality. Bias towards males in population counts. Males are less than 500 (Option A) : This is incorrect because the male population being so low would result in an extremely skewed sex ratio, which is unrealistic in this context. Females are less than 500 (Option B) : This is incorrect because a sex ratio greater than 1000 implies there are more females, not fewer. Females are less than 5000 (Option D) : This is incorrect because for the sex ratio to exceed 1000, the number of females must be more than 5000.

      },
      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer A - Decline in dependency ratio Demographic bonus occurs when a country's working-age population (15-64 years) grows larger relative to the dependent population (children under 15 and elderly above 65). This results in a decline in the dependency ratio, meaning fewer dependents for every working individual. It provides an opportunity for economic growth if the working-age population is productively employed. Dependency ratio is the average number of economically dependent individuals per 100 economically productive individuals in a specific country, territory, or geographic area at a given time. To calculate the dependency ratio, we use the formula: Total dependency ratio: 48.27% Young age dependency ratio: 38.89% Old dependency ratio: 9.8% (increased due increased life expectancy, initially 8%) Demographic Gift Demographic Liability The demographic gift occurs when the working-age population is high relative to dependents. The higher proportion of elderly individuals refers to demographic liability. Represents a potential demographic dividend due to a larger workforce contributing to economic growth. Represents potential economic challenges due to increased dependency ratios and healthcare costs Contributors include higher productivity, increased savings, and economic growth Dependents include retirees, elderly individuals, and those requiring significant healthcare Demographic Burden Refers to the increase in the proportion of the dependent population relative to the economically productive population. It signifies the societal challenge of supporting a larger dependent population, which typically occurs due to ageing demographics. Demographic Bonus A phase in a nation's demographic evolution in which the proportion of the dependent population relative to the working-age population declines. This is often associated with economic growth opportunities as more people are in the workforce than dependents. Demographic Window: Refers to a period in a nation's demographic structure when the proportion of the population in the working-age group is at its highest. Demographic Dividend: An increase in economic growth driven by a growing proportion of working-age individuals in the population Options B, C, and D are unrelated to the concept of the demographic bonus.

High death rates due to poor sanitation, limited medical care, and high incidences of disease and famine. Stage I is generally seen in pre-industrial societies, where population growth is slow and fluctuates due to high mortality rates. Stage II (Option B): is incorrect because, in Stage II, death rates decline significantly due to improvements in healthcare, sanitation, and nutrition, while birth rates remain high, resulting in rapid population growth. Stage III (Option C): is incorrect because, in Stage III, birth rates decline as a result of increased access to contraception, women's education, and urbanization, while death rates continue to decline, leading to a slower population growth. Stage IV (Option D): is incorrect because, in Stage IV, both birth rates and death rates are low , and the population tends to stabilize or grow slowly, as seen in many developed countries today.

It is an important indicator of the health status of an entire population, socio-economic conditions, and the health status of infants. It is a sensitive indicator to assess the availability, utilization, and effectiveness of healthcare usually in perinatal care.

Assesses number of years of life added due to the intervention and hence the benefit and value for money of the intervention QALY - 1 year of life lived in perfect health Positive indicator of the cost-effectiveness of an intervention. Scored between 0 (death) and 1 (perfect health). Disability-adjusted Life Years (DALY) (Option D) DALY= Years of life lost to premature death + years lived with disability 1 DALY: 1 year of healthy life lost It is a measure of the burden of disease and the effectiveness of intervention Year of life lost (YLL): Calculated from the number of deaths at each age multiplied by the expected remaining years of life according to a global standard life expectancy. Years lost to disability (YLD): Where the number of incident cases due to injury and illness is multiplied by the average duration of the disease and a weighting factor reflecting the severity of the disease on a scale from 0 (perfect health) to 1 (dead). DALY = YLL + YLD Health Adjusted Life Expectancy (HALE) The average number of years a newborn is expected to live in full health considering the current age-specific mortality rate. Healthy Life Expectancy HALE = Life Expectancy at birth + adjustment of time spent in poor health HALE = LE-DALY Life Expectancy Average no. of years a newborn is expected to live,",

TFR takes into account the age-specific fertility rates of women across all reproductive ages. TFR provides valuable information about the reproductive behavior of couples within a population and is used by demographers and policymakers to understand trends in population growth, as well as to formulate policies related to family planning, healthcare, and social services. Incorrect Options: NRR (Option B): Net Reproduction Rate (NRR) is the number of daughters or girls a newborn girl will bear or will have throughout her reproductive lifespan, considering the current age-specific fertility patterns and mortality rates. NRR is a mortality dependent fertility indicator. GFR (Option C): General Fertility Rate (GFR ) is the total number of live births in an area in a year per 1000 women in the reproductive age group (15-49 years) in a year. Not everyone in the reproductive age group is exposed to the risk of childbirth. GRR (Option D): Gross Reproduction Rate (GRR) is the total number of girls a woman will have throughout her reproductive age, considering the current age-specific fertility pattern and with out mortality. · GRR is given by TFR for girl children.
