      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: C) Multifactorial Theory Explanation: The Multifactorial Theory of disease causation emphasizes that diseases are not caused by a single factor but by a combination of genetic predisposition, environmental influences, lifestyle choices, culture, and physiological factors. Theory Description Miasma Theory (Option A) Suggests that diseases are caused by \" bad air \" or miasmas, disease occurrence is associated with environmental conditions. Germ Theory (Option B) States that microorganisms (germs) are the primary cause of many diseases, given by Louis Pasteur. Epidemiological Triad Theory (Option D) Describes the interaction between the agent, host, and environment. Reference: Park’s Textbook of Preventive and Social Medicine, 27th edition, page no: 40",

        "C": "Virulence",

      },
      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: C) Virulence Explanation: The Case Fatality Rate (CFR) is closely related to virulence, representing the killing power of a disease. It is calculated as the ratio of deaths to cases , without specifying a time interval, using the formula: CFR is a proportion, not a rate. CFR is typically used for acute infectious diseases (e.g., food poisoning, cholera, measles) but is less useful for chronic diseases due to the long and variable period from onset to death. The CFR for the same disease can vary across different epidemics due to agent, host, and environmental changes. CSR (Case survival rate) = 100-CFR Definition Virulence The degree of severity or harmfulness of a disease, measuring the proportion of severe or fatal cases. Infectivity (Option A) The ability of a pathogen to establish an infection and spread among a population. Pathogenicity (Option B) The ability of a microorganism to cause disease determines whether an infection will manifest as an illness. Transmissibility (Communicability) (Option D) The ability of a disease to be transmitted from one host to another indicates how easily it spreads. This is measured by Secondary attack rate.",

      "options": {
        "A": "It identifies a single cause for targeted intervention.",
        "B": "It suggests that only one factor needs to be addressed for disease control.",

      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: C) It highlights multiple points where interventions can reduce disease occurrence. multiple factors contributing to disease. By mapping these relationships, public health professionals can identify several intervention points, providing various strategies to reduce disease occurrence. It is ideal for studying chronic diseases where the disease agent is often unknown. Epidemiology studies clusters of causes and their effects, showing various possible interventions to reduce disease occurrence. In multifactorial events, individual factors have different levels of importance. The relative importance of individual factors can be expressed as \"relative risk\".",

      "explanation": "Correct Answer: C) Rabies Explanation: Rabies progresses rapidly from initial infection to severe neurological symptoms and death without distinct stages of varying severity. Diseases like Leprosy (Option A), Influenza (Option B), and Tuberculosis (Option D) have distinct stages of varying severity. Spectrum of Disease: It represents the range of variations in disease manifestations. This difference in manifestation reflects individual differences in immunity and susceptibility. Leprosy exemplifies the spectrum of disease principles, showing varying severities. Significance: The spectrum of disease includes both subclinical and clinical cases, facilitating comprehensive disease study.

      "explanation": "Correct Answer: B) Measles Explanation: Measles typically does not exhibit a large hidden portion in the Iceberg phenomenon due to its highly recognizable symptoms, lack of long-term asymptomatic carriers, and prompt clinical diagnosis. Iceberg phenomenon of disease: It suggests that some diseases have a significant portion of undiagnosed or asymptomatic cases, while only a small portion is diagnosed and visible. The \"tip of the iceberg\" denotes diagnosed cases or apparent infections of concern to physicians, where diagnostic tests are applied. The \"hidden portion\" includes undiagnosed or asymptomatic individuals of concern to epidemiologists, who may appear healthy but harbor the disease's pathogenesis.

      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: B) Occupation and income Explanation: The Human Poverty Index (HPI) does not typically consider occupation and income. It focuses more on deprivation in basic human capabilities and social indicators rather than solely on income or occupation. The Human Poverty Index (HPI) was developed to measure relative poverty, which refers to the lack of access to other facilities and services. Indicators of HPI: Longevity: The proportion of people not surviving until the age of 40 years). Knowledge: Adult Literacy Rate Standard of living: No access to safe water supply and sanitization and % of children underweight. HPI 1 is used for developing countries, and HPI 2 is used for developed countries. In 2010, HPI was replaced by the Multidimensional Poverty Index( MDPI).

The use of MDPI is the measure of acute poverty. India’s MDPI is 0.121, with a 27.5% poor population. The Human Poverty Index ( HPI) was replaced by the MDPI in 2010, as it was not specific to any group of people. Individuals are classified as multidimensionally deprived if they fall short in at least one dimension or in a combination of indicators that total the weight of a full dimension. Households are considered poor if deprived in indicators adding up to 1/3 or more .
