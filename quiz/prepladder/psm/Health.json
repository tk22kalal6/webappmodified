      "explanation": "like insufficient calorie intake and low per capita income. While the scenario doesn't provide exact numbers, the family's struggles clearly align with these criteria. The scenario describes a family facing hardships indicative of poverty: Poor Diet: A diet primarily of rice and lentils suggests limited nutritional variety, which is common in poverty. Lack of Sanitation and Healthcare: These are significant indicators of low living standards often associated with poverty. Inconsistent Income: An inability to consistently afford basic needs is a strong characteristic of being below the poverty line. Criteria of BPL: According to Tendulkar committee Rural areas Urban areas Per capita calorie intake <2400 kcal per day <2100 kcal per day Per capita Income <27/- INR per day <33/- INR per day According to Rangarajan committee Per capita income is <32/- INR per day in the rural area. <47/- INR per day in the urban area. As per World Bank If the per capita income is <2.15 US per day, this is an extreme poverty level. Option A: This contradicts the scenario, as APL households typically can afford basic needs and have a better standard of living. Options C and D: The family's struggles with basic needs rule out these possibilities.

Forms of doctor-patient relationships: Aspect Paternalistic Approach Mutualistic Approach Consumeristic Approach Defaulter Approach Definition Doctor makes decisions for the patient Doctor and patient make decisions together Patient makes decisions with minimal input from the doctor Neither doctor nor patient is actively involved in decision-making Advantages Efficient in emergencies, reduces patient anxiety Builds trust, encourages patient engagement Empowers patient, respects patient autonomy Minimal effort required Disadvantages Can lead to patient dissatisfaction, lack of patient autonomy Requires time and good communication skills May result in poor medical decisions without a doctor's expertise Ineffective, poor health outcomes Examples Emergency surgery, critical care Chronic disease management, mental health care Elective procedures, cosmetic surgery Neglect in preventive care Levels of communication: Cultural: Doctors should be aware of the community's cultural patterns and concepts of health. Emotional: Doctors should listen sympathetically to the patient and their family. Intellectual: Doctors should bridge the social distance and communicate clearly.
