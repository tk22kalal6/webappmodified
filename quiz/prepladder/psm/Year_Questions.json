Urban areas rely more on primary health centers (UPHCs) and Swasthya Chowkis instead. PHC (Option A): is incorrect because Primary Health Centers are part of the urban health care delivery system in certain cities for providing outpatient care and preventive services. CHC (Option B): is incorrect because Community Health Centers, although predominantly in rural areas, can also be established in semi-urban regions for specialty care. Swasthya chowki (Option C): is incorrect because these are urban healthcare units that play a role in healthcare delivery for densely populated urban slums.

The sub-centre is the lowest level of healthcare delivery and plays a key role in providing basic health services, including maternal and child health services, and managing family planning records. PHC (Option A): is incorrect because while PHCs provide a broader range of services than sub-centres , they do not typically maintain detailed records of eligible couples at the ground level. CHC (Option B): is incorrect because CHCs provide more specialized care and cover a larger area, but the maintenance of records for eligible couples is primarily managed at the sub-centre . District hospital (Option D): is incorrect because district hospitals focus on providing higher-level medical care and are not primarily responsible for maintaining family planning records for eligible couples, which is the role of sub-centres .

      },
      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: A) Less than 20 Explanation: Type-A Primary Health Centers (PHCs) are typically small, rural healthcare facilities that are designed to serve a population in a limited geographical area. These centers typically handle fewer deliveries per month compared to higher-tier healthcare facilities. The number of deliveries is generally less than 20 per month at a Type-A PHC. 20 or above (Option B): is incorrect because Type-A PHCs usually manage fewer deliveries, with the number generally being less than 20 per month. Less than 30 (Option C): is incorrect because the Type-A PHC usually handles fewer than 20 deliveries, so 30 deliveries would typically be beyond its capacity. 30 or above (Option D): is incorrect because the capacity of a Type-A PHC is unlikely to handle 30 or more deliveries per month, which is more typical of larger health centers or hospitals.

      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: B) Doctor on premises Explanation: While it is important for schools to have access to healthcare services, having a doctor on premises is not a mandatory requirement for School Health Services . In many schools, a school health program is run by a nurse or a trained health worker , with doctors available for consultations when needed. The focus of school health services is on preventive care, routine health screenings, and maintaining health records. Having a doctor on-site is not a necessary component, as healthcare professionals can also be consulted through local health centers or clinics. Education of handicapped children (Option A): is incorrect because education of handicapped children is typically part of the school's inclusive education program, which is not directly linked to the medical services provided by the school health service, but is a separate educational initiative. Dental and eye health services (Option C): is incorrect because dental and eye health services are a key component of the school health service program, focusing on the prevention and treatment of common conditions like cavities, vision problems, and other health issues in children. School health records (Option D): is incorrect because maintaining school health records is an essential part of the school health service to monitor and track the health status, vaccinations, and any medical issues of students, ensuring proper care and follow-up when necessary.

      "explanation": "services without financial hardship, irrespective of their country’s income. Challenges arise in low- and middle-income countries due to financial constraints, infrastructure gaps, and workforce shortages. Providing healthcare to everyone requires balancing resource allocation, government policies, and international support. Countries with lower incomes struggle with financing UHC, requiring external aid, innovative financing, and efficient healthcare systems. While UHC is an ideal goal, the feasibility of full coverage for all remains a major challenge globally. Universal Health Coverage (UHC)- A Global Challenge UHC is a key goal of global health initiatives, ensuring access to essential healthcare services without financial hardship for all individuals, regardless of their economic background. Principles of UHC Principle Explanation Equitable Access Everyone should receive healthcare regardless of socioeconomic status. Financial Protection Out-of-pocket expenses should not cause financial hardship. Quality Care Services should be effective, safe, and patient-centered. Sustainability Health systems should be designed for long-term viability. Challenges in Implementing UHC Challenge Reason Limited Financial Resources Low-income countries struggle to fund universal healthcare. Healthcare Workforce Shortage Lack of trained professionals, especially in rural areas. Infrastructure Gaps Inadequate hospitals, equipment, and medical supply chains. Political and Policy Barriers Differences in government commitment to UHC implementation. Global Strategies to Overcome UHC Challenges Strategy Description Innovative Financing Public-private partnerships, health insurance schemes, and global funding. Technology Integration Telemedicine and digital health solutions to expand access. International Support WHO and global organizations aiding low-income countries. \"Inequalities in the distribution, adequate support, and access to quality-assured products only in low-income settings\" (Option A): Incorrect because inequalities exist globally, not just in low-income settings. \"The purpose of UHC is to find a balance between countries' income, health provision, and financial burden\" (Option B): Incorrect because UHC aims to provide healthcare to all, not just balance economic factors. \"UHC only deals with the financial aspect of health and cannot cover health provision to all\" (Option D): Incorrect because UHC includes both financial protection and healthcare service expansion.
