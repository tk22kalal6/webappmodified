      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: C) Xenopsylla cheopis Explanation: Fleas are the primary vectors responsible for transmitting plague to humans. The most important vector is Xenopsylla cheopis (Oriental rat flea). These fleas typically live on rodents, especially rats, which serve as the main reservoir for the plague bacterium Yersinia pestis . The flea ingests up to 0.5 cubic millimetres of blood containing up to 5,000 plague bacilli, which multiply in its gut and can block the proventriculus, preventing food intake. Such blocked fleas starve due to the inability to feed, repeatedly regurgitating bacilli into bite wounds while attempting to feed, thus efficiently spreading the plague. Partially blocked fleas, living longer than fully blocked ones, pose a greater danger. Xenopsylla cheopis Anopheles spp (Option A) helps in the transmission of malaria. Ixodes spp (Option B) transmits Lyme disease, anaplasmosis, babesiosis, and ehrlichiosis. Pediculus humanus (Option D) causes pediculosis. It is a type of body louse.",

      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: C) Cheopis index Explanation: The \"Cheopis index\" refers to the average number of Xenopsylla cheopis fleas found per rat in a given area. Significance: The Cheopis index serves as a valuable metric for assessing flea density and evaluating the efficacy of spraying programs. Threshold: A Cheopis index of 1 or higher is the threshold for potential plague transmission to humans. The total flea index (Option A) measures the total density of all flea species present in an area. The Specific flea index (Option B) measures the density of a particular flea species, such as Xenopsylla cheopis. The burrow index (Option D) measures the density of fleas found in burrows, which is particularly relevant for certain flea species that reside there.

        "D": "Quarantine of infected individuals"
      },
      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: C) Vector control Explanation: Vector control through effective insecticide use is considered the most effective method to break the transmission cycle of plague. Targets the primary vector: Insecticides such as DDT, BHC, and 5% malathion directly target fleas, the main vectors of plague. Interrupts transmission cycle: Reducing flea populations breaks the link between rodents and humans. Preventive approach: It's a proactive measure that can prevent outbreaks before they occur. Control of Plague: Early diagnosis and prompt notification of cases are crucial. Isolation of patients, especially those with pneumonic plague, is recommended. (Option D) Treatment should start immediately with streptomycin (30 mg/Kg IM in 2 divided doses x 7 days) or tetracycline (30 mg/Kg PO) as primary options. (Option B) Vector control through effective insecticide use is the most important method to break transmission. (Option C) Rodent control and improved sanitation are essential long-term preventive measures. Vaccination can be a valuable preventive measure, given in two doses at least a week before potential exposure. (Option A) Chemoprophylaxis with tetracycline (500mg Q6H x 5 days) or sulfonamides (2-3gm/day x 5-7 days) is recommended for contacts and high-risk individuals. Disinfection of patient's belongings and proper handling of dead bodies are important precautions. Reference: Park’s Textbook of Preventive and Social Medicine, 27th edition, Page: 343",

      "correct_answer": "D",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: D) Plague Explanation: Plague is primarily prevented through public health measures, antibiotics, and, in some cases, vaccines. Passive immunization is not commonly used for plague prevention. Plague is a Zoonotic disease with epidemic potential. Prevention : An effective method to break the transmission of plague is to control rat fleas by spraying insecticides. The most recommended is 5% malathion. Vaccination : Effective usually if carried out in 1 week before anticipated plague outbreak. Vaccine stain: Sokhey modified haffkine vaccine. Dosage Day 0: 0.5ml, SC. Day 14: 1ml SC (days 7 to 14). In case of an outbreak, a primary dose of 3 ml for adults is given. Immunity Development: Immunity develops 5 to 7 days after vaccination and lasts 6 months. Booster Dose: Recommended for high-risk individuals at 6-month intervals. Recommendation: Mainly recommended for travellers and health professionals. Rabies (Option A): Both active immunization (rabies vaccine) and passive immunization (rabies immunoglobulin) are available and used in combination, especially post-exposure. Diphtheria (Option B): Both active immunization (diphtheria toxoid vaccine) and passive immunization (diphtheria antitoxin) are available. Tetanus (Option C): Both active immunization (tetanus toxoid vaccine) and passive immunization (tetanus immunoglobulin) are used, especially for wound management.

      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: C) Aedes aegypti mosquito Explanation: Zika virus disease should be considered in patients with acute onset of fever, maculopapular rash, and arthralgia, particularly if they have travelled to areas with ongoing transmission in the two weeks before symptom onset. Zika virus is transmitted by the Aedes aegypti mosquito. Zika virus disease: Agent: Zika virus is a Flavivirus transmitted via mosquito bite; hence, it is called an arbovirus. Mode of Transmission: Transmitted by the bite of an infected Aedes aegypti mosquito , which tends to bite during the morning and late afternoon. It is also increasingly recognized that an infected pregnant woman can pass the virus to her baby during pregnancy or near the time of birth. Clinical Symptoms: Fever, skin rash, conjunctivitis, joint pain, headache. Symptoms are usually mild and last 2-7 days. Pregnant women are at increased risk for developing both fetal and maternal complications. Prevention: Prevention and control depend on reducing mosquitoes by removing and modifying breeding sites. Anopheles mosquito (Option A): Primarily known for transmitting malaria. Culex mosquito (Option B): Primarily known for transmitting West Nile virus and other arboviruses. Ixodes tick (Option D): Known for transmitting Lyme disease and other tick-borne illnesses unrelated to mosquito-borne diseases.
