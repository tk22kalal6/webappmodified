The strength and direction of the correlation increase as the correlation coefficient approaches -1 or +1. Confidence interval of 95% (Option A) : This option is incorrect because the correlation coefficient measures the relationship between variables, while confidence intervals estimate a parameter's likely range. Not statistically significant (Option C) : This option is incorrect because statistical significance refers to the probability that the observed correlation is due to chance. Strong correlation (Option D) : Strong correlations typically have coefficients closer to -1 or +1, indicating a more pronounced relationship.

The whiskers extend 1.5 times the IQR or to the maximum and minimum values within the range, with no outliers beyond them. 2- Positively Skewed Distribution: In a positively skewed distribution, most data cluster at the lower end with a long tail towards higher values. The whisker and box plot reflects this by shifting the box towards the lower end, with the median closer. The longer whisker on the higher end accommodates the tail, with any outliers beyond it. 3- Negatively Skewed Distribution: In a negatively skewed distribution, most data cluster at the higher end, with a long tail toward lower values. The whisker and box plot reflects this by shifting the box towards the higher end, with the median closer. The longer lower whisker accommodates the tail, with any outliers beyond it. 4- Normal Distribution with Outliers: In a normal distribution with outliers, the box and whisker plot resembles a standard distribution, but with outliers plotted beyond the whiskers. These outliers deviate significantly from the majority of the data and may be shown as individual points or special symbols.

If this relationship holds consistently across all groups, it suggests a strong positive correlation within the entire dataset. This is depicted by tight clustering of data points along an upward-sloping trend line on the scatter plot. The correlation coefficient is a statistical measure that describes the strength and direction of a relationship between two variables. It ranges from -1 to 1: +1 means a perfect positive correlation (as one variable increases, the other also increases). -1 means a perfect negative correlation (as one variable increases, the other decreases). 0 means no correlation (no relationship between the variables). Incorrect Options: Less than 0.6 (Option B) : If a positive correlation of 0.6 exists within each group, and it holds consistently across all groups, the total correlation for the entire dataset would be at least 0.6. More than 0.6 (Option C) : Total correlation might surpass 0.6, but without more details like group weights or sample sizes, we can't be sure. Skewed coefficient of 0.6 (Option D) : The term \"skewed coefficient\" typically refers to an asymmetrical distribution, not the correlation coefficient itself.",

It doesn't involve randomization because it synthesizes data from studies where randomization has already occurred, particularly in randomized controlled trials (RCTs). It quantitatively and qualitatively analyses the results from various studies to reach a common conclusion. It differs from a systematic review in that the latter can be used to analyse the outcome of only a single study. Meta-analysis takes the upper hand because the final outcome will always be reliable if multiple studies on the same topic are being analysed rather than a single study. Incorrect Options: Selection (Option A) : Selection is a crucial step in meta-analysis. It involves identifying and selecting relevant studies that meet the inclusion criteria for the analysis. Analysis (Option B) : Analysis in meta-analysis involves extracting and synthesizing data from selected studies to obtain pooled estimates of treatment effects or associations through statistical methods. Abstraction (Option D) : In meta-analysis, abstraction involves extracting vital data from selected studies. Reference: Park’s Textbook of Preventive and Social Medicine, 27th Edition, Page no: 60",

      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer B - Ordinal scale data The Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) is used to assess the level of consciousness in a patient. It assigns scores based on three components: Eye opening (1 to 4) Verbal response (1 to 5) Motor response (1 to 6) The total score ranges from 3 to 15, with higher scores indicating better neurological function. Data Type: The GCS is considered ordinal scale data because: The scores indicate an order or rank (e.g., a score of 4 is better than 3 in motor response). However, the difference between scores (e.g., between 3 and 4) does not necessarily represent an equal increment in consciousness level, which makes it ordinal rather than interval or ratio. Nominal scale data (Option A) : Used for categorization without any order (e.g., blood groups). GCS has an inherent ranking, so it is not nominal. Alphanumerical data (Option C) : Refers to data containing letters and numbers. GCS consists only of numerical scores. Interval scale data (Option D) : Involves ordered data with equal intervals between values (e.g., temperature in Celsius). GCS does not have equal intervals between scores, so it is not interval scale data. Reference: https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC1320380/",

The Friedman test is a non-parametric alternative to the repeated measures ANOVA , used to test differences between groups when the data is paired or repeated. Student t-test (Option A) : This is a parametric test, used to compare the means of two groups. It assumes that the data follows a normal distribution. ANOVA (Option C) : Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) is a parametric test used to compare means across three or more groups. It assumes normality and homogeneity of variance. Pearson (Option D) : The Pearson correlation coefficient measures the strength of a linear relationship between two continuous variables. It is parametric and assumes normality.

      "explanation": "Correct Answer: C) Poisson distribution Explanation: The Poisson distribution is used to model the probability of a specific number of events occurring within a fixed time period or spatial area, given a known average rate of occurrence. It is typically applied in situations where events happen independently and randomly over time, such as the number of calls at a call center, accidents at an intersection, or infections in a population. Binomial distribution (Option A) : The binomial distribution models the number of successes in a fixed number of independent Bernoulli trials (e.g., flipping a coin or testing a drug's efficacy), where the probability of success is constant for each trial. Gaussian distribution (Option B) : The Gaussian (Normal) distribution is a continuous probability distribution that is used to model variables that tend to cluster around a mean. It is not specific to counting events within a time period. Normal distribution (Option D) : This is another term for the Gaussian distribution , which is used for continuous variables rather than discrete event counts over time.

      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: B) Stratified random sampling Explanation: In a diverse population, such as the one in urban Delhi, stratified random sampling is an effective method to ensure that different subgroups (or strata) of the population are represented in the sample. In this case, the population can be divided into subgroups based on factors like socioeconomic status, age, dietary preferences, or geographic location within the urban region. After dividing the population into strata, random samples are then taken from each group, ensuring that the sample is representative of the entire population. Cluster random sampling (Option A): is incorrect because cluster sampling is used when the population is divided into clusters, often geographically, and entire clusters are randomly selected. While this can be used in large-scale studies, it doesn't specifically ensure representation of the diverse subgroups within the population as well as stratified sampling. Simple random sampling (Option C): is incorrect because simple random sampling involves selecting individuals from the entire population randomly without considering any subgroups. While it may still give a sample, it may not adequately represent the diverse dietary habits of the population in urban Delhi. Systematic random sampling (Option D): is incorrect because systematic random sampling involves selecting every nth individual from a list or a sequence of individuals. While it's easier to implement, it doesn't ensure that different groups within the population are represented as effectively as stratified sampling.

The patient would need another point–of–care diagnostic test for the same clinical condition (Option A): A highly sensitive test that gives a negative result already provides strong evidence to rule out the disease, and further testing is generally unnecessary. The prevalence of the disease is 2% (Option B): Sensitivity does not directly relate to disease prevalence; prevalence is the proportion of individuals in a population who have the disease. The patient has been wrongly ruled out due to false negatives (Option D): With a sensitivity of 98%, the chance of a false-negative result is very low (only 2%).

      "explanation": "the community. It reflects the number of new cases detected per 100,000 people. A high rate of new case detection suggests an active effort to identify and diagnose cases early, which is crucial for effective control of leprosy in the community. Thus, it is an important indicator for evaluating how well the health system is identifying new cases. Treatment completion rate (Option A) : While this indicator is essential for assessing the success of leprosy treatment, it does not directly help in determining how well the health system is identifying new cases in the community. It is more about patient adherence to treatment after diagnosis. Treatment initiation rate (Option C) : This is important for assessing how quickly patients are started on treatment after diagnosis. However, it doesn't directly indicate the system's effectiveness in identifying new cases in the first place. Proportion of newly diagnosed patients with grade 2 disability (Option D) : This is more about the severity of the disease at diagnosis rather than how effectively the health system is identifying new cases. A higher proportion of patients with grade 2 disability indicates delayed diagnosis, which is a problem, but it doesn't directly measure case identification.

The odds ratios for each age group (>50 years) consistently increase, and all p-values are <0.001 , indicating a strong and statistically significant association between age and the risk of blindness. Illiteracy leads to an increased risk of developing blindness (4) : This is true . The odds ratio for illiterate individuals is 1.2, and the p-value is <0.01 , indicating a statistically significant association between illiteracy and a higher risk of blindness. The female population is at greater risk of developing blindness (1) : This is false . The odds ratio for females is 0.3, which indicates a lower risk compared to males, as a value less than 1 indicates a protective effect for females. The p-value is significant (<0.001), further supporting this finding. People dwelling in rural areas are at increased risk of developing blindness (2) : This is partially true , but the p-value of 0.1 for rural residence suggests that the result is not statistically significant , despite the odds ratio of 2.4 indicating a higher risk.

Denominator (Total months in the review period) – (months stopped using contraception for non-pregnancy reasons) Minimum Data At least 600 months of exposure. Disadvantages PI assumes a constant failure rate over time, but contraceptive failure rates typically decline with longer use. High-fertility couples conceive earlier, skewing results towards lower-fertility couples later in studies. PI ignores factors beyond accidental pregnancy that affect effectiveness, like user dissatisfaction, side effects, attempts to conceive, or loss of follow-up. Better methods Life Table Analysis is a better method to evaluate contraceptive efficacy. It calculates cumulative failure rates over a specified time frame, like one month. Pharmacological index (Option A) : There is no such index specifically used to evaluate contraceptive failure.

      "explanation": "the Chi-square test. This involves investigating whether there's a significant association between the variables \"sex\" (male or female) and \"type of cancer\" (e.g., lung, breast). The test compares observed frequencies in a contingency table to expected frequencies under the assumption of independence between variables, determining if the association is statistically significant. Incorrect Options: Option A (Age and serum cholesterol level): The association between age and serum cholesterol level would typically be analyzed using correlation or regression analysis rather than the Chi-square test. Option B (Heart rate and body mass index): Similarly, the association between heart rate and body mass index would be more appropriately analyzed using correlation or regression analysis. Option D (Weight of a patient before and after treatment): The comparison of weight before and after treatment would typically be analyzed using paired t-tests or other appropriate statistical tests, depending on the specific research design and assumptions.

With a significance level of 0.05, results are statistically significant if the p-value is less than this threshold. Since 0.04 is below 0.05, we reject the null hypothesis, concluding the new treatment is more effective. While similar remission rates could be chance, statistical analysis indicates this difference isn't solely due to randomness.. Incorrect Options: Option A - Both the treatments are equally effective: The p-value of 0.04 signifies a significant difference between treatments, suggesting they aren't equally effective. Option B - Neither of the treatments is effective:The study didn't assess treatment effectiveness but compared remission rates between them. Since both treatments had identical remission rates, we can't conclude their ineffectiveness from this data. . Option D - The information given is not adequate to compare the efficacy of the treatments: The p-value of 0.04 indicates a statistically significant difference in remission rates between treatments, implying a meaningful efficacy difference.",

Unlike parametric tests, which make assumptions about the underlying distribution of the data (such as a normal distribution), non-parametric tests do not rely on these assumptions. Instead, they are designed to analyze data that may not meet the requirements of parametric tests, such as when the data is not normally distributed or when the data is ordinal or categorical. Incorrect Options: Option A: ANOVA is an example of a non-parametric test- ANOVA (Analysis of Variance) is an example of a parametric test, not a non-parametric test. Option C: It involves the assumption that the data has a normal distribution- non-parametric tests do not assume that the data has a normal distribution. In fact, they are specifically used when the data does not meet the assumption of normality.
