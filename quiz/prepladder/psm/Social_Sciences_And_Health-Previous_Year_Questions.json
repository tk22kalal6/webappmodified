Unlike the Human Development Index (HDI), which considers economic factors, the PQLI focuses solely on basic physical needs. It is calculated using three key indicators: Life Expectancy at Age One : Reflects overall health and longevity in the population, excluding infant mortality. Infant Mortality Rate : Measures the number of infants who die before their first birthday per 1,000 live births, indicating healthcare quality and child health. Literacy Rate : The percentage of people aged 15 and above who can read and write, reflecting education and access to knowledge. Incorrect Options: Options A, B and C are incorrect as given above.",

      "question": "Which barrier is the doctor addressing when a male patient expresses concern about potential impotency from the recommended vaccine during a vaccination drive?",
      "options": {
        "A": "Physical barrier",
        "B": "Environmental barrier",
        "C": "Physiological barrier",
        "D": "Cultural barrier"
      },
      "correct_answer": "D",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: D) Cultural barrier Explanation: The concern raised by the male patient regarding impotency due to a vaccine reflects a cultural barrier . This is a belief or misconception rooted in social and cultural influences that may cause hesitation or reluctance toward vaccination, even when scientific evidence supports the vaccine's safety and effectiveness. Cultural barriers can stem from misinformation, myths, and stigmas related to vaccines that may be prevalent in a community or group. Physical barrier (Option A): is incorrect because a physical barrier would refer to an actual, tangible impediment, such as poor access to healthcare facilities, not misconceptions or fears about side effects. Environmental barrier (Option B): is incorrect as environmental barriers refer to external factors like pollution, poor infrastructure, or geographical challenges that hinder access to healthcare, which is not the case here. Physiological barrier (Option C): is incorrect because physiological barriers would involve biological factors that prevent proper functioning or access to healthcare, such as allergies or medical conditions, not the cultural beliefs affecting the patient's attitude toward vaccination.

      "question": "What kind of family would the surveyor categorize the household as, considering it consists of a 35-year-old man, his 6-week pregnant wife, a 3-year old child, and the temporary presence of the man's brother and his wife during their winter vacation?",
      "options": {
        "A": "Joint family",
        "B": "Nuclear family",
        "C": "Extended family",
        "D": "Third generation family"
      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: B) Nuclear family Explanation: A nuclear family consists of parents and their children living together in the same household. In this scenario, the 35-year-old man , his 6-week pregnant wife , and their 3-year-old child form the core of the family, which is characteristic of a nuclear family. Although the man's brother and his wife are temporarily staying with them, their presence is temporary and does not alter the classification of the family type. Joint family (Option A): is incorrect because a joint family typically includes multiple generations (e.g., grandparents, uncles, aunts) living together. In this case, only the nuclear family members are mentioned, and the brother's presence is temporary. Extended family (Option C): is incorrect because an extended family usually refers to a family structure that includes additional relatives beyond the nuclear family, such as uncles, aunts, grandparents, and cousins, either living together or in close proximity. The brother's presence is temporary and does not fit this definition. Third generation family (Option D): is incorrect because this term generally refers to families that consist of the grandparents , parents , and children living together. There is no indication in the scenario that grandparents are involved, so it does not fit the description. Reference: Park’s Textbook of Preventive and Social Medicine, Edition 26, Page 773, 774",

        "C": "Panel discussion",
        "D": "Seminar"

      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: B) Counselling Explanation: In counselling , confidentiality is a fundamental principle where personal information shared by the client is kept private, fostering trust and open communication. Exceptions apply only in situations involving harm or legal requirements. Group discussion (Option A) : is incorrect because group discussions involve multiple participants sharing information openly, making confidentiality difficult to maintain. Panel discussion (Option C) : is incorrect because panel discussions are typically public forums where multiple speakers discuss a topic openly in front of an audience. Seminar (Option D) : is incorrect because seminars are educational or informational gatherings where confidentiality is not inherently protected as discussions occur publicly.

        "B": "Census",
        "C": "Death certificate",
        "D": "Lay reporting"
      },
      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer A - Vital registration system The Vital Registration System is a comprehensive and continuous system for the registration of births and deaths. It involves the mandatory registration of every birth and death occurrence with the relevant government authorities, typically at the local or municipal level. The system aims to provide a complete and official record of vital events in the country. Cause of death in India is noted by multiple methods, including: Sample registration system: It is a demographic survey conducted by the Registrar General of India. It collects data on births and deaths through a representative sample of households, including information on the cause of death. Census: (Option B) The census is primarily focused on population enumeration and demographic details. It does not directly record causes of death. During the decennial Census, information on deaths that occurred during the census year is collected. Census enumerators gather data from households, including details of the causes of death reported by family members. Death declaration & medical certificate: (Option C) When a person dies, a medical certificate of cause of death (MCCD) is typically issued by a qualified medical practitioner who attended to the deceased during their last illness. The MCCD provides information about the immediate cause of death, underlying causes, and contributing factors. Lay reporting: (Option D) Lay reporting refers to the reporting of deaths by individuals or non-medical personnel.

It helps in categorizing individuals into different socioeconomic classes based on their income, occupation, and education level. Income, Occupation, Education: This option correctly identifies the components of the Kuppuswamy scale. Income refers to the individual's or family's earnings, occupation represents the type of work or profession, and education indicates the level of formal education attained. Incorrect Options Option A: Income, Housing, Education- While income and education are included in the Kuppuswamy scale, housing is not one of its components. Housing is an important indicator of socioeconomic status, but it is not specifically considered in the Kuppuswamy scale. Option B: Income, Livestock, Housing- Livestock is not one of the components of the Kuppuswamy scale. The scale primarily focuses on income, occupation, and education as indicators of socioeconomic status. Option C: Housing, Livestock, Land- Similarly, livestock and land are not components of the Kuppuswamy scale. These factors may be relevant in assessing socioeconomic status in other contexts, but they are not included in the Kuppuswamy scale.",

The number of children is a key determinant of completed family size. As each child is born, it contributes to the overall size of the family. Therefore, the more children a couple or a woman has, the larger their completed family size will be. Incorrect Options Option A . Number of adolescents: The number of adolescents in a family does not directly determine the completed family size. Adolescents refer to individuals who are in the transitional phase between childhood and adulthood, and their presence alone does not impact the total number of children born. Option B . Number of women: The number of women alone does not determine the completed family size. While the reproductive choices and behaviors of women contribute to the overall fertility of a population, it is the actual number of children born that reflects the completed family size. Option D . Number of persons: The total number of persons in a family includes individuals of all ages, including children, adolescents, and adults. While the size of the family affects various aspects of family dynamics, the completed family size specifically focuses on the number of children.",
