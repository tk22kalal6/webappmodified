      "question": "Dr. Sarah made a presentation on Infectious diseases. She spoke about prevention and treatment of Zika virus. Which of the following is true with respect to the prevention of Zika virus?",
      "options": {
        "A": "Symptomatic treatment with NSAIDs",
        "B": "Purified, inactivated FDA approved vaccine is found to be helpful in prevention",
        "C": "Sexual abstinence, using condoms, delaying pregnancy is helpful in controlling the disease",
        "D": "Immunoglobulin and plasmapheresis is used in the treatment of Zika"
      },
      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "the disease transmission is well-documented, hence abstinence, condom use, and delaying pregnancy help prevent spread. No FDA-approved vaccine is available for Zika virus prevention. Symptomatic treatment is given, but NSAIDs are avoided initially due to the risk of hemorrhagic complications in dengue co-infection. Immunoglobulin and plasmapheresis are not standard treatments for Zika virus. Zika Virus – Epidemiology, Prevention, and Control Overview of Zika Virus Zika virus is a Flavivirus transmitted by Aedes mosquitoes (A. aegypti and A. albopictus). It causes mild flu-like illness , but severe complications include congenital Zika syndrome (microcephaly) and Guillain-Barré syndrome . Modes of Transmission Mosquito bites – Primary mode of spread. Sexual transmission – Virus persists in semen, vaginal fluids. Maternal-fetal transmission – Can cause congenital defects. Blood transfusion – Rare but possible. Prevention Strategies for Zika Virus Prevention Method Effectiveness Mechanism Mosquito control Highly effective Elimination of breeding sites, insecticide use Personal protection Effective Wearing long sleeves, using insect repellents Sexual abstinence/condoms Effective Prevents sexual transmission of the virus Delaying pregnancy Advised in endemic areas Reduces risk of congenital Zika syndrome Vaccination Not available No FDA-approved vaccine exists yet NSAIDs for treatment Initially avoided Risk of bleeding if dengue co-infection is present Immunoglobulin & plasmapheresis Not standard treatment No proven benefit in Zika virus management Why No Vaccine Yet? Zika virus is structurally similar to dengue virus , leading to concerns about antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE) . Several vaccines are under development, but no FDA-approved vaccine exists . Symptomatic treatment with NSAIDs (Option A): Incorrect because NSAIDs are avoided initially due to the risk of bleeding in possible dengue co-infection. Purified, inactivated FDA-approved vaccine (Option B): Incorrect because no FDA-approved vaccine exists for Zika virus prevention . Immunoglobulin and plasmapheresis (Option D): Incorrect because they are not used in routine Zika virus treatment .
