      "explanation": "Correct answer: A) Neonatal tetanus by 2025 Explanation: India has already eliminated neonatal tetanus in May 2015. The World Health Organization defines the elimination of neonatal tetanus as the incidence of less than one case per 1,000 live births annually in every district nationwide. Elimination of a disease is defined as interrupting modes of transmission of disease in the environment, although the causative agent persists in the community. Diseases that have been eliminated from India. DISEASE YEAR Leprosy 2005 Occurrence of less than 1 case per 10,000 at subnational and district level. Maternal and neonatal tetanus May, 2015 Occurrence of less than 1 case per 1,000 live births annually.

      "explanation": "Correct answer: D) Dracunculiasis Explanation: Dracunculiasis (Guinea worm infection) has not been eradicated because all modes of transmission have not been completely terminated. Eradication of the disease refers to the complete termination of all modes of transmission of the disease and is a global occurrence. It exhibits an 'all or none' phenomenon , where the agent is completely exterminated and no longer exists in the environment. Extinction of a disease occurs when, after eradication, the agent is no longer maintained under supervision in CDC or WHO laboratories.

      "explanation": "Correct answer: D) Early diagnosis and treatment Explanation: Secondary prevention involves detecting and treating diseases early, before symptoms or complications arise, to prevent progression and minimize health impacts. Early diagnosis and treatment are a secondary level of prevention as the disease has already been established in the patient, but it is in its early stages without any complication, and thus, it is reversible, examples include screening tests for diseases (diabetes). It focuses on reducing the prevalence of disease by prompt treatment and shortening the disease duration. Immunization program (Option A) prevents the onset of infectious diseases through vaccination, a primary prevention strategy . Health education (Option B) promotes knowledge and behaviour change to prevent disease and promote health, a primary prevention strategy.

On the other hand, primary prevention targets the prevention of disease development in the high-risk population. Primary prevention includes: Health promotion: Health education camps on exercise and lifestyle diseases. Mental health promotion and counselling in schools and colleges. Implementing strict laws against drinking and driving to prevent road traffic accidents due to impaired driving (Option A). Specific protection: Administration of MR vaccination to children prevents measles and rubella infection via active immunization, as the risk of infection is high during childhood (Option B). Iodization of salt helps prevent endemic goiter, especially in the Himalayan region, where the diet lacks iodine (Option C).

The primary goal is to prevent the progression from disease-induced impairment to a handicapped state. The sequence of events leading to disability and handicap is as follows: Disease → Impairment → Functional Limitation → Disability → Handicap Disease is the initial pathological condition. Impairment refers to a problem in body function or structure. Functional Limitation is the restriction in performing fundamental physical actions. Disability is the restriction or lack of ability to perform an activity in the manner considered normal for a human being. Handicap refers to a disadvantage that limits or prevents the fulfilment of a normal social role for an individual.

It can occur either in healthcare facilities or at home, depending on illness severity and resource availability. It is a defensive strategy. Quarantine (Option B) separates and restricts the movement of individuals exposed to a contagious disease for a maximum known incubation period, but not yet symptomatic to monitor for symptoms and prevent potential disease spread upon becoming infectious. Isolation and quarantine are examples of primary prevention. Social distancing (Option C) is a public health measure involving maintaining physical distance and avoiding crowded places or gatherings. It aims to prevent the transmission of infectious diseases but applies broadly, not specifically to individuals already ill. Contact tracing (Option D) is the process of identifying and monitoring individuals in close contact with an infected person. It is used to identify potential secondary cases and implement appropriate measures, such as quarantine or testing, to prevent further transmission.
