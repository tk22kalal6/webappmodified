      },
      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: A) Plan A Explanation: Priya's daily protein requirement is approximately 49.8 g. Only dietary plan A meets and exceeds this requirement with 55g of protein among the given options. The Recommended Dietary Allowance (RDA) is the daily nutrient intake level that meets the needs of nearly all healthy individuals within a specific life stage and gender group. It is designed to guide supervised supplementation for individuals who are deficient or have certain conditions. Based on Indian RDA guidelines, an average Indian adult requires 0.83 grams of protein/kg/day. Priya's daily protein requirement: Protein requirement = Body weight × Protein requirement per kg Protein requirement = 60 kg × 0.83 g/kg = 49.8 g/day Evaluating each dietary plan: Option A: Total protein = 12 g + 18 g + 25 g = 55 g Option B: Total protein =1 g + 4 g + 6 g + 18 g = 29 g Option C: Total protein = 6 g + 14 g + 18 g + 8 g = 46 g Option D: Total protein = 3 g + 7 g + 15 g + 0.5 g = 25.5 g Reference: Revised Short Summary Report-2024, ICMR-NIN Expert Group on Nutrient Requirements for Indians, Recommended Dietary Allowances (RDA) and Estimated Average Requirements (EAR)-2020",
