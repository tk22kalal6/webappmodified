      "explanation": "Correct answer: C) Yellow and Red Explanation: The first patient, with a closed femur fracture and stable vitals, is triaged as YELLOW, requiring assistance within 24 hours. The second patient, in respiratory distress, necessitates immediate resuscitation and is triaged as RED. Triage: During a disaster, the quantity and severity of injuries overwhelm the operative capacity of the health facilities. Triage involves rapidly organizing the injured individuals based on the severity of their injuries and survival with prompt interventions. During triage, tagging should be done to each individual, including: Name Age Place of origin Triage category Diagnosis and Initial treatment. Color coding in triage: Types of triage: Reverse triage: Used in surge (bed scarcity) and during wars. Priority: Green ‚Üí Yellow ‚Üí Red. Simple triage and Rapid Treatment (START): Done in remote or inaccessible areas. Laymen can start doing triage before rescue teams reach.

      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Correct answer: C) Ensure thorough water chlorination and adequate sanitation Explanation: Epidemiological Survey and Disease Control: Post-disaster: Due to Disease Poor sanitation and overcrowding Acute respiratory diseases Gastrointestinal diseases (most common) Displacement of animals Zoonotic diseases Floods Leptospirosis and rickettsia The most common vitamin deficiency post-disaster is Vitamin A deficiency. Contamination of the water supply and displacement of the population are the most common causes of communicable diseases. Therefore, ensuring a safe water supply with chlorination and proper sanitation is the most effective step to decrease the risk of infectious diseases (option C). Vaccination protocol: All vaccines except for measles are contraindicated post-disaster (option A). Multidose vaccines, such as typhoid and cholera vaccines, have poor compliance and have not yet proven to be effective as a large-scale public health measure. The most common post-disaster outbreak is measles . For this reason, measles vaccines can be given within three days of exposure since the time taken for antibodies to form is less than the natural incubation period of the disease. Tetanus vaccine is given based on previous vaccinations and severity of injury. Vaccines for healthcare workers : Cholera, Typhoid, Tetanus, Hep B. Meticulous antibiotic supply requires additional persons who can be helpful in other areas of disaster, and identifying infected and uninfected individuals is a time-consuming process. (Option B) Following a disaster, there will be disruption of properties, displacement of people, monetary restrictions, limited personnel and poor sanitation. For these reasons, isolating infected people is difficult. (Option D) Reference: Park's Textbook of Preventive and Social Medicine, 27th edition, Page 924",

Disaster Mitigation in Health Sector : Focuses on safeguarding health facilities and public services like water and sanitation to prevent economic strain during post-disaster rehabilitation. Importance of Safe Water and Sanitation : Vital for disaster mitigation in health, as contamination or disruption of water supplies can lead to social upheaval and costly rehabilitation efforts. Structural Mitigation Measures : For example, Utilizing engineering modalities to prevent hazards, Proper land use (option A) Improved building codes for earthquake-resistant structures (option B) Flood mitigation codes for dam resistance (option D) Relationship to Disaster Management Cycle : Represents a proactive approach within disaster management, complementing preparedness and response activities to minimize disaster impacts.
