      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: C) Cohort Study Explanation: A cohort study follows a group of individuals over time to see who develops cirrhosis and compares the incidence between those who consume alcohol and those who do not. This design can establish a temporal relationship and directly measure the risk of developing cirrhosis, making it the most appropriate choice for this investigation. Cohort studies are a type of observational study design that follows a group of people (a cohort) over time to assess the outcomes of exposure to certain risk factors or interventions. Indications to conduct a cohort study: Exposure Assessment Incidence Calculation Time Relationship Rare Exposures Multiple Outcomes Long Latency Period Natural Course Randomised controlled trial (RCT) involves randomly assigning participants to different interventions to compare outcomes. While RCTs are the gold standard for establishing causality, it would be unethical and impractical to randomly assign individuals to consume alcohol to study its effects on cirrhosis development.

Study Design Retrospective or prospective. Prospective (or retrospective in some designs). Data Collection Usually relies on existing records or interviews Collects data over time, often with direct measurements. Population Starts with disease status (cases vs. controls) Starts with exposure status (exposed vs. unexposed). Advantages - Quick and inexpensive. - Useful for rare diseases. - Can study multiple exposures. - Can establish temporal relationships. - Useful for studying multiple outcomes. - Less bias in exposure measurement Disadvantages - Prone to recall bias. - Cannot directly measure incidence. - Selection bias may occur. - Time-consuming and expensive. - Requires large sample sizes. - Loss to follow-up can affect results.

      "explanation": "Correct Answer: C) Nested case-control study Explanation: Researchers conducted a nested case-control study using a subset of cancer patients (cases) and cancer-free people (controls) from an ongoing cohort study. Nested case-control study: A type of case-control study that draws its cases and controls from a defined cohort. Data collection is prospective. Combines the efficiency of a case-control study (feasible for rare outcomes, cost-effective) with some of the advantages of a cohort study, such as the ability to establish temporality and reduce recall bias. In a cohort study (Option A ) , researchers follow a group of individuals (the cohort) to observe how exposures affect the incidence of outcomes. This study design was not used in the scenario since the cases and controls were selected from an existing cohort rather than being followed from the start. A case-control study (Option B) involves identifying individuals with the outcome of interest (cases) and comparing their past exposures to those without the outcome (controls). Unlike in a nested case-control study, these individuals are not selected from an existing cohort. A cross-sectional study (Option D) examines exposure and outcome status at a single time. This design does not follow participants over time and cannot establish causality or temporality. Reference: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/7845919/",

      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: A) Local distribution of a disease Explanation: The image shows a spot map, which is useful for determining the local distribution of a disease. Spot maps/Shaded maps: It is useful in outbreaks to determine the local distribution of a disease. Inner and outer city variations in disease frequency are well known. These variations are best studied using spot maps. They show areas of high and low frequency at a glance, the boundaries, and distribution. For example, if the map shows a clustering of cases, it may suggest a common source of infection or a common risk factor shared by all the cases. The classic example of the use of spot maps was by John Snow for the cholera epidemic in 1854. Migration studies: They compare disease and death rates between migrants and their new environment versus their place of origin. This helps identify whether changes in disease incidence are due to genetic factors or environmental exposures. There are two main types of comparisons: Between migrants and individuals who stayed in the country of origin to determine environmental effects. Between migrants and the local population in the new environment to distinguish the effects of new exposures.",

      "explanation": "who develop them. Correct Answer: B) The population's disease analysis is based on the characteristics of the people who develop them. Explanation: Person distribution in descriptive epidemiology involves analysing disease patterns based on demographic characteristics such as age, sex, race, occupation, and other factors of the individuals who develop the disease. The distribution of people across an area under study: Describes the geographical distribution of a population. Focuses on where people live in a given area, emphasizing place distribution rather than individual characteristics related to disease. Distribution of human resources to various tasks of the study: Addresses the logistical aspect of study conduct. Involves allocation of researchers and resources to different tasks, not related to person distribution in epidemiology. Distribution of residents within different neighbourhoods or urban areas: Concerns the spatial distribution of residents within a city or region. Focuses on place distribution, lacking emphasis on individual characteristics that define person distribution in epidemiology. Understanding these host factors aids in epidemiological studies, identifying high-risk groups, and informing preventive strategies.

Explanation: Propagated epidemic: Most often of infectious origin. Person-to-person transmission. Gradual rise and tailing off. It can occur with diseases that have varying incubation periods. E.g. HIV/AIDS, which has a long incubation period but spreads through person-to-person contact, leading to a propagated epidemic. To stop transmission, the number of susceptibles should be reduced or the susceptibles should be protected from exposure. Herd immunity, contact opportunities, and secondary attack rates determine the speed of spread. Aggregating many susceptibles or a regular supply (birth, immigration etc.) of susceptibles favours the development of propagated epidemics. Examples: Hepatitis A, polio.

Example: Influenza during winter in temperate regions, where the disease is prevalent during certain seasons but affects all age groups similarly. Holoendemic : A high level of infection begins early in life and affects most of the child population, reaching a state of equilibrium such that the adult population is less commonly affected.

A cohort study is a study design that follows a group of individuals (cohort) to observe how different exposures affect the incidence of specific outcomes. Interventional Study (Option A): An interventional study, also known as an experimental study, involves the researcher actively intervening to modify one or more factors and observing the effects of these changes. Descriptive Study (Option C): A descriptive study primarily describes the characteristics of a population or phenomenon being studied. It does not aim to test hypotheses or investigate causal relationships. Analytical Study - Case Control (Option D): A case-control study is retrospective, starting with individuals who already have the outcome (e.g., asthma) and comparing them to those without the outcome to determine past exposures. In the scenario described, the researcher collects data prospectively which aligns with a cohort study.

To assess the incidence, a Cohort study (Option A) starts by determining whether risk factors are present. Case-control study (Option C) determines if an exposure is associated with an outcome. It starts with diseased and non-diseased. An Ecological study (Option D) compares exposure and disease frequency in a series of populations. The unit of study is population.

      "explanation": "Correct Answer: B) Healthy individuals are units of study in randomised clinical trials. Explanation: In randomized controlled trials (experimental study), the study unit is individuals with a particular condition or disease that the intervention aims to treat or prevent. Experimental study Unit of study RCT Diseased individuals Field trials (e.g. Vaccine trials) Healthy Individuals Advantages Disadvantages Provides evidence for the direct effect of an intervention and its outcome. Hence, a disease can be confirmed using Experimental or Interventional epidemiology (Option A) . For example, vaccines and drug manufacturing took place after the confirmation of the COVID-19 virus. Cost: Experimental studies, especially large-scale RCTs, can be expensive to conduct (Option C). Evaluate the efficacy of new drugs, vaccines, and therapies and compare between two interventional groups. Ethical concerns: Ethical considerations often pose limitations on experimental studies (Option C). Experimental studies often include control groups to compare the effects of the intervention (Option D): This is true because having a control group allows us to compare outcomes between those who receive the intervention and those who do not. This comparison helps to isolate the intervention's effect, thereby providing stronger evidence about its efficacy and safety.
