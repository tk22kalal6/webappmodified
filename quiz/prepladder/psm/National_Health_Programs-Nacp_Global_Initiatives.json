      "explanation": "Correct Answer: C) 80% Explanation: The National Strategic Plan for HIV/AIDS in India aims to achieve an 80% reduction (using a 2010 baseline) in new HIV infections by 2024. National Strategic Plan for HIV/AIDS and STIs 2017-2024 implemented in India aims to achieve an \"AIDS-free India\" by providing universal coverage of HIV prevention, testing, and treatment. The plan sets a goal of zero new infections, zero AIDS-related deaths, and zero AIDS-related stigma and discrimination. 6 Key Objectives of the National Strategic Plan for HIV/AIDS in India (2017-2024): Objective Target Timeline Objective 1: Reduce new HIV infections 80% reduction (using a 2010 baseline) By 2024 Objective 2: Ensure people living with HIV (PLHIV) know their status 95% of estimated PLHIV know their HIV status By 2024 Objective 3: Ensure PLHIV have ART initiation and retention 95% of PLHIV have initiated and are retained on antiretroviral therapy (ART) By 2024 Objective 4: Eliminate mother-to-child transmission Eliminate mother-to-child transmission of HIV and syphilis By 2020 Objective 5: Eliminate HIV/AIDS-related stigma and discrimination Eliminate stigma and discrimination related to HIV/AIDS By 2020 Objective 6: Facilitate sustainable NACP service delivery Ensure the National AIDS Control Programme (NACP) service delivery is sustainable By 2024 The plan also recognizes the different epidemiological contexts across states and union territories in India and emphasizes a tailored approach for each context: Mature Epidemic : States/UTs with high HIV incidence and prevalence in key, bridge, and other at-risk populations. Emerging Epidemic : States/UTs with relatively new and rising infection rates among at-risk populations. Low or Stable Epidemic : States/UTs with low infection rates require sustained focus to maintain low rates and eliminate transmission.

      "explanation": "Correct Answer: B) Biennial Explanation: HIV sentinel surveillance is conducted biennially, with the most recent surveillance in India done in 2021. Sentinel Surveillance for HIV: HIV Sentinel Surveillance HIV sentinel surveillance tracks missing cases and monitors HIV infection trends in specific groups and regions to understand epidemic dynamics and guide public health interventions. Objectives Monitor HIV infection trends & emerging pockets of HIV infection. Estimate HIV prevalence in general population as well as high-risk groups and burden in the country and high-risk groups across states. Provide data for program evaluation and improvement. Key Features Focus on High-Risk Groups: Commercial sex workers (CSW), men who have sex with men (MSM), injecting drug users, transgender individuals, single male migrants, and long-distance truck drivers. Antenatal Women as Proxies: Includes data from antenatal women to estimate HIV prevalence in the general population. Specific Sample Size: Total sample size in India(from the 2016-2017 study) is 900, divided among CSWs (250), MSMs (250), and antenatal women (400). Sample size from 2021 study - 400 antenatal women. Key Uses Resource Allocation: Helps direct resources and interventions to the most affected areas and populations. Program Evaluation: Tracks trends to evaluate the effectiveness of HIV/AIDS control programs. Early Warning System: Acts as an early warning for emerging outbreaks or changes in transmission patterns.

      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: B) P24 antigen Explanation: P24 antigen is a laboratory marker that tests positive in the window period of HIV infection. LABORATORY DIAGNOSIS OF HIV INFECTION Screening tests ELISA screens for HIV antibodies (most sensitive) Confirmatory tests Western blot - A confirmatory test confirms specific antibodies against p24 and gp41 proteins. (highly specific) Confirmatory test for adults - qPCR for HIV1 Confirmatory tests of infants < 1 year - HIV DNA RT-PCR Virus Isolation Direct virus testing is not standard; HIV isolation from cultured lymphocytes is costly and resource-intensive. CD4 Lymphocyte Count Most reliable predictor of HIV progression; absolute count indicates immune system health, with <200 cells/µL signalling a high risk of AIDS-related infections. CD4 Lymphocyte Percentage Independent indicator of disease progression; <14% suggests a heightened risk of AIDS-related complications. HIV Viral Load Tests Measure actively replicating HIV in blood; correlate with disease progression and assess antiretroviral therapy effectiveness. Other Markers Beta-2 microglobulin (B2M) levels (Option C) and p24 antigen presence indicate immune activation and viral replication, aiding disease assessment.

Under this strategy, the patient is informed that HIV testing will be performed as part of routine tests unless they decline. This increases uptake, reduces stigma, and normalizes HIV testing. HIV Testing Strategies: Strategy Description Used in Opt-in testing (Option A) Patient is offered HIV test and must give explicit consent to be tested Common in older models and low-prevalence areas Opt-out testing (Option B) HIV testing is done as part of routine care unless the patient actively refuses Recommended by CDC, WHO for generalized testing Compulsory testing (Option D) HIV test is done without the patient’s consent or knowledge (e.g., blood donation screening) Used in select public health or legal situations Both opt-in and opt-out (Option C) Not a formal strategy- rather a theoretical combination Not standardized or recommended together Reference: https://data.unaids.org/una-docs/hivtestingpolicy_en.pdf https://www.unaids.org/en/resources/presscentr e/pressreleaseandstatementarchive/2023/november/20231129_new-research-on-opt-out-hiv-testing-england",
