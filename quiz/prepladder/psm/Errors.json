Level of significance: Null hypothesis is accepted / results are not statistically significant when 95% CI for the mean difference between 2 variables includes 0 95% CI for odds ratio or relative risk includes 1 CI between 2 groups do not overlap → statistically significant difference exists. Option B) An odd’s ratio of 0.9 with a 95% Confidence interval of 0.5 to 8: The CI includes 1, meaning there is no significant difference and hence not statistically significant. Option C) A p-value of 0.5 and a relative risk of 2.5: The p-value is >0.05 hence it is not statistically significant. Option: D) A relative risk of 5.0 with a 95% Confidence interval of 0.1 to 9.8: The CI includes 1, meaning the results are not statistically significant.

Confidence Level: A 95% confidence level means that if we take many random samples and compute a confidence interval for each, we expect 95% of those intervals to contain the true population mean.

This is incorrect because the confidence interval does not give the probability of the population mean being within the interval. Option B: 95% of the newborns in the sample have weights between 3.2 kg and 3.8 kg. This is incorrect because the confidence interval pertains to the mean weight, not the distribution of individual weights within the sample.

In reality, the drug does have an effect (the null hypothesis is false). The researchers fail to reject the null hypothesis Key points: Type II error occurs when we fail to reject a false null hypothesis. It results in missing a real effect or relationship. In this case, a potentially beneficial drug might be overlooked. Type II errors are particularly important in medical research, as they can lead to overlooking potentially beneficial treatments. The power of a statistical test (1 - probability of Type II error) is crucial in designing studies to minimise this risk.

      "explanation": "Correct answer: D) COV can be negative if the standard deviation is smaller than the mean. and both the standard deviation and the mean are non-negative quantities. Therefore, COV values are always non-negative and cannot be negative. COV = σ / mean x 100 The coefficient of variation (COV) is specifically designed to compare the variability of datasets with different means. (Option A) It standardises the measure of dispersion by expressing the standard deviation as a percentage of the mean, allowing for meaningful comparison even when the datasets have different scales. A higher COV signifies that the standard deviation is relatively larger than the mean, indicating greater variability or spread of data points around the mean and less reliable (Option B). A lower COV indicates that the standard deviation is smaller than the mean, suggesting that data points are closer to the mean. This typically implies more consistency and less variability, which can indicate higher reliability of the dataset for analysis or decision-making. (Option C).

Calculate the deviations from the mean: Deviation for 120: 120 − 125= − 5 Deviation for 125: 125 − 125=0 Deviation for 130: 130 − 125=5 Deviation for 122: 122 − 125= − 3 Deviation for 128: 128 − 125=3 3.
