        "A": "Multiphasic screening",
        "B": "Mass screening",
        "C": "High-risk screening",

      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "exposure. In this case, family members of diabetic and hypertensive patients are at a higher genetic and lifestyle risk of developing these conditions. This approach optimizes resources by focusing on a subgroup with a greater probability of disease, improving early detection and intervention. Types of Screening in Public Health Screening programs are classified based on population coverage and purpose . Type of Screening Description Example Mass screening Testing entire populations , regardless of risk. Screening all adults in a village for hypertension. High-risk screening Targeting individuals with known risk factors . Screening family members of diabetics for early detection. Multiphasic screening Conducting multiple tests in one session to detect various diseases. Screening for diabetes, hypertension, and cholesterol simultaneously. Anonymous screening Testing where participants' identities remain unknown . HIV screening in high-risk populations without recording names. Multiphasic screening (Option A): Incorrect because this involves testing multiple diseases in one go , rather than focusing on a high-risk group. Mass screening (Option B): Incorrect because mass screening includes everyone , not just high-risk individuals. Anonymous screening (Option D): Incorrect because identity is not concealed in this scenario; screening is based on family history.

      "explanation": "second trimester, specifically between 24 and 28 weeks of pregnancy. This screening is important to identify gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM), a type of diabetes that develops during pregnancy and can pose risks to both the mother and the baby. GDM is characterized by elevated blood sugar levels that occur during pregnancy and usually resolves after childbirth. Incorrect Options: Option B - 32-36 weeks: It is not the typical timeframe for diabetic screening in pregnancy. By this time, if GDM has not been identified earlier, it might be too late to implement effective interventions. Option C - 18-24 weeks: It is relatively early in the pregnancy and not the standard time for diabetic screening. GDM usually becomes more evident as pregnancy progresses. Option D - 14-18 weeks: It is also relatively early in the pregnancy and not the standard time for diabetic screening. GDM typically develops later in pregnancy due to changes in hormone levels and insulin resistance.",

        "A": "Visual inspection after application of freshly prepared solution 5% acetic acid solution",
        "B": "Colposcopy",
        "C": "Cervical biopsy",
        "D": "High vaginal biopsy"
      },
      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "solution Correct Answer A - Visual inspection after application of freshly prepared solution 5% acetic acid solution: Visual inspection after the application of a 5% acetic acid solution, also known as VIA (Visual Inspection with Acetic Acid) is a widely used and effective method for the initial screening of cervical cancer in resource-limited settings. Visual inspection with acetic acid (VIA): is a simple and cost-effective method that involves the application of 5% acetic acid to the cervix. The acid causes any abnormal areas to turn white, which can be visually detected. VIA is a suitable screening method in primary health centers as it does not require sophisticated equipment or extensive training. If an abnormal area is detected, further diagnostic tests such as colposcopy and cervical biopsy may be recommended. Colposcopy (Option B): Is not typically used as an initial screening method in primary health centers due to the need for specialized equipment and trained personnel. Cervical biopsy (Option C): Is an invasive procedure and is not typically performed as part of the initial screening process. High vaginal biopsy (Option D: Is not a specific screening method for cervical cancer and is not commonly used as an initial screening strategy.

        "A": "Antigen test",
        "B": "Real-time RT PCR",
        "C": "CBNAAT",
        "D": "TruNat"
      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer B - Real-time RT PCR The above image shows the cycle threshold or Ct value of Real time RT PCR which is used to assess the viral genetic load. In the graph above, the cycle number is on the x-axis and relative fluorescence is on the y-axis. Real-Time RT PCR CT value (cyclical threshold) - Inversely Proportional to virus load. The CT or threshold cycle value is the cycle number at which the fluorescence generated within a reaction crosses the fluorescence threshold, a fluorescent signal significantly above the background fluorescence. At the threshold cycle, a detectable amount of amplicon product has been generated during the early exponential phase of the reaction. The threshold cycle is inversely proportional to the original relative expression level of the gene of interest. Antigen test (Option A): A rapid antigen test, is a rapid diagnostic test suitable for point-of-care testing that directly detects the presence or absence of an antigen. CBNAAT (Option C): The cartridge-based nucleic acid amplification test (CBNAAT) assay is a real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) cartridge-based assay for the simultaneous detection of Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex and rifampicin resistance from biological specimen samples within two hours. TruNat (Option D): TrueNat is a comprehensive test for screening and confirming the COVID-19 virus in India. Reference: https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8232180/",

        "D": "Specificity depends on prevalence of the disease"
      },
      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Predictive Value (PPV): It is the probability that individuals with a positive test result truly have the disease or condition of interest. It indicates how well a test result predicts the presence of the disease. Formula: Negative Predictive Value (NPV): It is the probability that individuals with a negative test result do not have the disease, reflecting the diagnostic power of a test to exclude disease correctly. It indicates how well a negative test result predicts the absence of the disease. Formula: Incorrect Options: In a population with low prevalence of the disease, positive result with a highly sensitive test means true positive (Option A): In low disease prevalence, a positive result with a highly sensitive test doesn't always mean a true positive. Sensitivity depends on prevalence of the disease (Option B): Sensitivity isn't influenced by disease prevalence; it measures a test's ability to identify individuals with the disease. Specificity depends on prevalence of the disease (Option D): Specificity isn't influenced by disease prevalence; it measures a test's ability to identify individuals without the disease.

Isolation Quarantine For people who are sick For well people who may have been exposed to a communicable disease Separates people who are sick from those who are not sick Applies to people who may or may not become sick Restricts movement of people with an infectious disease to stop the spread of the Illness Restricts the movement of healthy people who may develop a disease after possible exposure to an infectious agent Allows for appropriate treatment in a hospital type/setting Requires people to stay in a designated location, e.g. their home. For a specified period of time Requires appropriate personal protective equipment (ppe) for those coming into contact with the person who is sick Requires active monitoring including taking temperature twice daily and checking for other symptoms Requires proper infection control, sterilization and waste management PPE not required for contact with people who are not ill Absolute Quarantine (Option A): It separates and restricts the movement of individuals exposed to a contagious disease but not yet symptomatic to monitor for symptoms and prevent potential disease spread upon becoming infectious. Interruption of transmission (Option C): Tactics to halt disease spread, including tracing, quarantine, and hygiene.

Prevalence of a disease at three different time periods are 10,20 and 30% based on a definitive investigation. Sensitivity and specificity of a new test are 40% & 70% respectively Since the sensitivity & specificity are going to be considered as constants throughout, the number of true positives and hence the positive predictive values will increase proportionately to the given prevalences over these three different time periods. Sensitivity (Option A): Sensitivity impacts the true positive rate, not PPV. Specificity (Option C): Specificity affects the true negative rate, not PPV. Relative Risk (Option D): Relative risk does not affect PPV. Reference: Park’s textbook of Preventive and Social Medicine, 27th edition, page 151-153, 156",
