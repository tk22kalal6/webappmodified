The 96% immunization coverage target is set to ensure that a significant proportion of the population is protected against the measles virus, creating herd immunity. Incorrect Options: Option A- 68%: This percentage is too low to achieve herd immunity and effectively control the spread of measles. Option B- 72%: Similar to option A, this percentage is insufficient to achieve the desired level of immunization coverage for measles eradication. Option C- 84%: While this percentage is higher than the previous options, it still falls short of the recommended 96% coverage needed for measles eradication.",
