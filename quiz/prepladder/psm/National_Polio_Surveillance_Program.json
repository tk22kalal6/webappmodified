      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "component of OPV outweighed its benefits. Correct Answer: C) The risk of cVDPV-circulatory vaccine derived polio virus linked to the type 2 component of OPV outweighed its benefits Explanation: Benefits of the tOPV to bOPV Switch: Risk Mitigation: No wild poliovirus type 2 (WPV2) has been detected since 1999, making the continued use of type 2 in tOPV unnecessary and potentially risky due to vaccine-associated paralytic poliomyelitis (VAPP) and circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus (cVDPV) associated with type 2 OPV, which resulted in outbreaks. IPV Introduction: Provides additional protection against type 2 poliovirus and boosts immunity to types 1 and 3, thereby reducing the risk of paralysis in case of an outbreak. Preparation for OPV Withdrawal: Sets the stage for the eventual withdrawal of all OPV types Note: tOPV (Trivalent Oral Polio Vaccine): Contains all three types of poliovirus (type 1, type 2, and type 3). bOPV (Bivalent Oral Polio Vaccine): Contains only type 1 and type 3 poliovirus strains. VAPP (Vaccine associated paralytic polio) - 2 types associated: Recipient VAPP : paralysis in a child who received OPV within 4-40 days of getting AFP. predominantly due P3 strain Contact VAPP: Unvaccinated non-immune child coming in contact of another child who is vaccine recipient and develops AFP , common in immunodeficient person , mostly with P2 strains VAPP cannot be transmitted from person-to-person Developed countries : due to 1st dose of OPV specifically after IPV Developing countries: due to subsequent doses of OPV.

      "correct_answer": "D",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: D) Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy Explanation: The scenario given is that of Acute Flaccid Paralysis (AFP). Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy is a genetic disorder with progressive muscle degeneration and weakness, not a sudden onset paralysis. Acute flaccid paralysis is sudden-onset, 4-week-long flaccid paralysis of the limb in a child under 15 years of age. The limb will not have any sensory loss. It will be floppy with a loss of deep tendon reflexes and tone.

      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: B) Reverse cold chain Explanation: In the cases of acute flaccid paralysis, the stool samples are collected and transported in a reverse cold chain mainly to investigate for polio. Acute Flaccid Paralysis [AFP] surveillance: Samples: Two stool specimens collected at least 24-48 hours apart within 14 days of paralysis onset (but can also be collected till 2 months) and sent to a WHO-accredited laboratory. Specimens must be transported in special screw-capped bottles under a reverse cold chain without preservatives. Specimens should reach the laboratory within 72 hours of collection. If the poliovirus is not isolated the case is termed \"compatible\" and reviewed by an expert committee for further classification. Line Listing: Records data of each AFP case. Reporting: AFP cases must be reported promptly to the District Immunity Officer, who informs the State Surveillance Officer and, subsequently, the National Surveillance Centre.

At least 80% of expected routine AFP surveillance reports should be received on time, including zero reports where no AFP cases are seen. The sensitivity of surveillance requires detecting at least two cases of non-polio AFP annually per 100,000 population aged less than 15 years in endemic regions. Completeness of case investigation mandates that all AFP cases must have three stool specimens collected within 7 days of paralysis onset.
