      "explanation": "Correct Answer: D) Gap of 2 years between 2 successive pregnancies Explanation: In a planned family the gap between two successive pregnancies should be atleast 3 years. Terms Used in Family Planning: Planned family: The birth of the first child should be delayed till the mother is 20 years old (option C). No child birth after the age of 30-35 years (option A). The ideal gap between marriage and first child birth should be 2 years (option B). There should be a gap of atleast 3 years between 2 successive pregnancies (option D). No unwanted pregnancies. Should have a limited family size. Eligible Couple: It is defined as, currently married couples wherein the wife is of reproductive age group (15-49 years). Around 150-180 eligible couples per 1000 population in India. Around 20% of eligible couples are found in age groups between 15-24 years. Eligible couple register is found at the sub-centre maintained by ANM. Target Couple: Not in use now It is defined as, a married couple who completed their family or having at least 1 child. Family planning is largely directed towards such couples. Reference: Park's Textbook of Preventive and Social Medicine, 27th edition, Page no. 567",

CPR is the indicator of the prevalence of contraceptive practices in the community. The demographic goal of NRR=1, can be achieved only when the CPR is >60%. The current couple protection rate in India is 66.7%.

      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: B) Pregnancies per 100 Woman-Years Explanation: The Pearl Index is calculated as the number of pregnancies that occur per 100 woman-years of exposure to a contraceptive method. It is a technique for evaluating contraceptive efficacy. Formula (Total accidental pregnancies / Total months of exposure) x 1200 Numerator The total number of accidental pregnancies, including pregnancies that resulted in live births, stillbirths, abortions, or are ongoing. Denominator (Total months in the review period) – (months stopped using contraception for non-pregnancy reasons) Minimum Data At least 600 months of exposure. Disadvantages PI assumes a constant failure rate over time, but contraceptive failure rates typically decline with longer use. High-fertility couples conceive earlier, skewing results towards lower-fertility couples later in studies. PI ignores factors beyond accidental pregnancy that affect effectiveness, like user dissatisfaction, side effects, attempts to conceive, or loss of follow-up. Better methods Life Table Analysis is a better method to evaluate contraceptive efficacy. It calculates cumulative failure rates over a specified time frame, like one month.

Not preferred since menstrual cycles are not always regular. Basal Body Temperature method: Prior to ovulation, the basal body temperature increases by 0.3 to 0.5 degree Celsius. The increase in temperature is due to an increase in progesterone (Option B). This method is reliable if the intercourse is restricted to the post ovulatory phase, after 3 days of temperature rise. Cervical mucus/Billings method: This method is based on changes in characteristics of cervical mucus observed as the menstrual cycle proceeds. During ovulation, cervical mucus becomes watery, smooth, slippery and profuse resembling raw egg white. After ovulation, cervical mucus thickens and decreases in quantity, due to increase in progesterone. This method requires a high level of motivation.",

On examination, she appears uncomfortable, and her abdomen is tender to palpation in the lower quadrants. Pelvic examination reveals no visible IUD strings.

      "explanation": "Correct Answer: C) Pelvic inflammatory disease (PID) Explanation The patient’s symptoms of fever and lower abdominal pain, along with her history of multiple sexual partners, point to the diagnosis of pelvic inflammatory disease, which is a complication of IUD use. Side effects of IUDs: Side effects of IUDs Bleeding Most common side effect; physiological bleeding resolves in 1-3 months. Iron supplementation may be needed. Persistent bleeding despite treatment may necessitate IUD removal. Pain Most common cause for removal Managed with analgesics. Resolves in 3 months. Severe pain may indicate uterine perforation (rare). Pelvic inflammatory disease (Option C) Presents with fever, abdominal pain, and discharge. Treatment involves broad-spectrum antibiotics. IUD removal if no improvement. 3rd generation of IUD is protective against IUD. Uterine perforation (Option B) Rare complications linked to immediate postpartum insertion or poor technique. 1st generation IUDs are associated with a higher risk of perforation. Failure of contraception § pregnancy Least pregnancies are reported with MIRENA. If a woman requests an induced abortion – legally allowed. If a woman wants to continue pregnancy and threads are visible: Pull the thread and continue pregnancy. Explain the risk of spontaneous abortion or congenital anomalies. If a woman wants to continue pregnancy and threads are not visible: Uterus examination for any complications. Evacuation of uterus if any complication is identified. If no complication identified , pregnancy can be continued after removal of IUD if the woman desires with increased risk of spontaneous abortion and pre term labour. Ectopic pregnancy (Option D) Recognized by lower abdominal pain, dark vaginal bleeding, or amenorrhea. Women at high risk should avoid IUDs. Expulsion (Option A) Typically occurs within weeks of insertion or during menstruation. Higher risk in young, nulliparous, postpartum women or using 1st generation IUDs Migration of IUD Rarely causes intestinal obstruction. Diagnosed via X-ray imaging if suspected.
