      "explanation": "hepatotoxicity (jaundice, hepatomegaly) Hepatocellular carcinoma Causative agent Infestation of Aspergillus flavus and Aspergillus parasiticus over stored rice, wheat, and corn Produce mycotoxins: aflatoxin B1 & G1 (both are hepatotoxic & carcinogenic) Risk factors Storage temperature of 11 to 37 degree Celsius Moisture content >16% Prevention Educating people Moisture content <10% during storage Incorrect Options Beta oxalyl amino alanine (Option A): Beta oxalyl amino alanine, also known as BMAA, is a neurotoxic amino acid that has been associated with the development of lathyrism, neurodegenerative diseases such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and Parkinson's disease. It is not directly linked to hepatocellular carcinoma. Smoke from factory (Option B): While exposure to certain industrial pollutants and chemicals can contribute to the development of various cancers, including liver cancer, the given scenario specifically mentions the worker being non-alcoholic and working in a groundnut factory. Therefore, smoke from the factory is not the most probable cause in this case. Sanguinarine (Option C): It is a toxic alkaloid present in argemone oil. It causes epidemic dropsy. This option is incorrect. Reference: Park’s Textbook of Preventive and Social Medicine 27th edition, page 759, 771,772",

      "question": "What is the most common cause of jaundice in this newborn presenting with conjugated hyperbilirubinemia, intrahepatic cholestasis, high alkaline phosphatase, and the presence of eosinophilic, PAS-positive cytoplasmic granules in liver biopsy specimens, suggestive of Alpha 1 AT deficiency?",

      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer B- Neonatal hepatitis Explanation: Neonatal hepatitis : Neonatal hepatitis is inflammation of the liver that occurs in newborn infants. It can be caused by various factors, including viral infections (such as hepatitis viruses), metabolic disorders, genetic conditions, and drug-induced liver injury. In the given scenario, the presentation indicative of neonatal hepatitis includes: Conjugated hyperbilirubinemia Intrahepatic cholestasis High alkaline phosphatase, Presence of eosinophilic PAS-positive cytoplasmic granules on liver biopsy Hypoplasia of biliary tract (Option A): Hypoplasia of the biliary tract refers to underdevelopment or incomplete formation of the bile ducts. It presents with pale stools and bile duct proliferation on biopsy, and can lead to impaired bile flow and subsequent cholestasis. However, it is not the most common cause of jaundice in the neonates. Choledochal cyst (Option C) : A choledochal cyst is a congenital anomaly characterized by dilatation of the bile ducts. It can cause bile flow obstruction and subsequently leads to conjugated hyperbilirubinemia, jaundice and an abdominal mass due to bile duct dilation. Unlike A1AT deficiency, it shows extrahepatic obstruction on imaging and lacks PAS-positive inclusions. Physiological (Option D): Physiological jaundice, is a normal and temporary condition that occurs in many newborns due to the immature liver's ability to process bilirubin efficiently. It presents with unconjugated bilirubinemia, not conjugated. Reference: Nelson Textbook of Pediatrics, 21st Edition, Page 2093-2094 https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4100675/",

      "question": "In a boarding school where students share the same canteen, one student experienced abdominal pain, jaundice, and fever.

      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "faecal-oral route. Hence the students can be suspected of acquiring Hepatitis A from the contaminated food. The diagnostic tests for Hepatitis A are a Stool sample, and an Anti HAV IgM antibody performed after 2 weeks of increase in the liver enzyme. Hepatitis A Virus (HAV) Most Common Cause of viral hepatitis in Children Most Common Cause of Acute Relapsing viral hepatitis Virus characteristics: HAV is a 27-nm, nonenveloped, single-stranded, positive-sense RNA virus, resistant to heat, acid, and ether. Mode of Transmission: Fecal-oral route. Incubation period: ~3–4 weeks. Pathogenesis: Replication is limited to the liver but found in the liver, bile, stools, and blood during the late incubation and pre-icteric phases. Faecal shedding, viremia, and infectivity decrease rapidly once jaundice appears. Clinical presentation: Asymptomatic cases Jaundice Cholestatic hepatitis Fulminant hepatitis - Acute liver failure especially in older adults or those with preexisting liver conditions. Does not lead to chronic liver disease. Diagnosis: Acute illness - anti-HAV IgM antibodies. (Option B) HAV RNA can persist in stools, liver, and serum for months after acute illness but is not correlated with persistent infectivity. Previous infection: IgG anti-HAV LFT: Elevated bilirubin, serum aminotransferases, and alkaline phosphatase (ALP). Treatment: Most cases are self-limiting No specific antiviral treatment Symptomatic management (10 % Dextrose) Prevention: Inactivated vaccination: Single antigen or in combination with hepatitis B Good sanitary conditions and measures IgA for hepatitis A (Option A): IgA is not specific to Hepatitis A and does not give accurate results. IgM for hepatitis B (Option C) and IgG for hepatitis B (Option D): Hepatitis A is transmitted by the faecal-oral route. Whereas hepatitis B is transmitted through blood or body fluids.",
