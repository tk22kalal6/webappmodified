WHO and UNICEF recommend the use of reduced osmolarity ORS due to the following advantages: Lower sodium and glucose concentrations decrease osmolarity, reducing the risk of adverse effects associated with hypertonicity.

Explanation: ORS solution is unnecessary if the child suffers from mild diarrhea and there are no signs of dehydration. In mild diarrhea, fluids/ORS should be given according to the child’s needs. Plan Criteria Management Steps A Mild diarrhea, no dehydration Counsel the mother to give extra fluids, continue feeding, give zinc supplements, follow up. Fluids: Small sips (50-100 ml after each loose stool for children up to 2 years, 100-200 ml for children over 2 years).

C Severe dehydration If possible, provide immediate IV fluids; otherwise, start ORS by mouth while setting up the IV. The dosage is 100 ml/kg Ringer's Lactate or normal saline over 1-5 hours, depending on the patient's age.
