      "question": "A researcher wants to know whether there is an association of CRP values with the risk of myocardial infarction/stroke. The study group was divided into quintiles and the following table is formed based on the study results. Which of the following statements is true regarding the relationship between CRP and the risk of myocardial infarction/stroke? Quintile CRP Values (mg/L) Relative Risk (RR) Study Population 1 0.1–1 1 6000 2 1.1–2 1.3 6000 3 2.1–3 1.7 6000 4 3.1–4 2.1 6000 5 4.1–5 2.8 6000",

        "D": "In quintile 1, there is no risk of Ml/stroke"
      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: B) Increase in CRP increases the risk of MI/stroke Explanation: C-reactive protein (CRP) is an inflammatory marker associated with cardiovascular disease risk. In the study, the relative risk (RR) increases progressively as CRP levels increase across quintiles: Quintile CRP (mg/L) Relative Risk (RR) 1 0.1–1.0 1.0 (Baseline) 2 1.1–2.0 1.3 3 2.1–3.0 1.7 4 3.1–4.0 2.1 5 4.1–5.0 2.8 Higher CRP levels are associated with an increasing relative risk of MI/stroke , indicating a positive correlation . Inflammation plays a key role in atherosclerosis , which explains the increased risk. CRP has no association with risk of MI/stroke (Option A) : This is incorrect. The increasing relative risk with rising CRP values shows that CRP is indeed associated with the risk of MI/stroke. Increase in CRP decreases the risk of MI/stroke (Option C) : This is incorrect because the relative risk increases as CRP levels rise, indicating an increased risk, not a decrease. In quintile 1, there is no risk of MI/stroke (Option D) : This is incorrect. Although the relative risk in quintile 1 is 1 (the reference group), it does not imply that there is no risk of MI/stroke. It means that the baseline risk is used for comparison, but individuals in this group still have some risk. Reference: Park’s Textbook of Preventive and Social Medicine, Edition 25, Page 86",

      "explanation": "Correct Answer: C) Explosive in nature Explanation: A single exposure point source epidemic is characterized by a sudden and simultaneous exposure to an infectious agent, leading to an explosive increase in cases within a short time frame, typically seen in foodborne or waterborne outbreaks. Has more than one incubation period (Option A): is incorrect because a single exposure point source epidemic typically results from a single exposure event, leading to cases clustering around a single incubation period. Has multiple peaks (Option B): is incorrect because a single exposure outbreak usually shows a single sharp peak, not multiple peaks. Slow rise and fall (Option D): is incorrect because a single exposure point source epidemic exhibits a rapid onset and decline in cases rather than a gradual change.

      },
      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer C - Obese and non-obese persons: In a case-control study, the cases are those with the condition of interest (in this case, obesity), and the controls are those without the condition (non-obese persons). After selecting these groups, the researcher would look retrospectively to assess the exposure to the risk factor (in this case, ordering food online). This design is ideal for studying the association between a specific exposure and an outcome. Salient Features of Case-control study Case-control study is an observational, analytical study. Both exposure and outcome have occurred before the start of the study. Control group who do not have the disease and Case group who have contracted the disease. Study precedes backwards from effect to cause, i.e. Outcome is used to determine the cause. Only obese persons, Only online food eaters (Options A and B): do not include a comparison group Online food eaters and non-online food eaters (Option D): focuses on exposure groups rather than outcome groups, which is not the correct approach for a case-control study.

      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer A - Prospective cohort This involves identifying a cohort of individuals (in this case, pregnant women) and collecting data on exposures (e.g., maternal smoking) during the study period, then following them forward in time to assess outcomes (e.g., birth weight of babies). In this study, smoking history is recorded during antenatal visits (before the birth), and birth weight is measured after delivery. Hence, it is prospective. Cohort studies are a type of observational study design that follows a group of people (a cohort) over time to assess the outcomes of exposure to certain risk factors or interventions. Indications to conduct a cohort study: Exposure Assessment Incidence Calculation Time Relationship Rare Exposures Multiple Outcomes Long Latency Period Natural Course Retrospective cohort (Option B): This would involve looking back at existing records to determine past exposure (e.g., smoking history from medical records) and linking it to outcomes (birth weight). Case-control study (Option C): This would start with cases (e.g., low birth weight babies) and controls (normal birth weight babies) and then look back to determine maternal smoking history. Cross-sectional study (Option D): This would assess both exposure (smoking history) and outcome (birth weight) at the same point in time, which is not the case here since birth weight is assessed after delivery.

      "explanation": "Correct Answer C - Randomization Randomization in clinical trials minimizes selection bias by randomly assigning participants to treatment or control groups. This ensures equal chances of placement, reducing the influence of confounding factors It balances known and unknown variables across groups, enhancing comparability and mitigating selection bias. Randomisation The technique where every participant will get an equal and known chance of being allocated to either the treatment group or the control group. Eliminates both known and unknown confounders. Selection bias is avoided by randomisation, which arises when the participants are not representative of the target population.

      "correct_answer": "D",
      "explanation": "of individuals in a population who have a particular disease or condition at a specific point in time. If the new drug decreases mortality but does not cure the disease, it means that individuals with the disease are living longer. As a result, the duration of the disease for each individual is prolonged, which may lead to an accumulation of cases over time. This accumulation of cases could potentially result in an increase in the prevalence of the disease. Although the drug may decrease mortality, it does not prevent new cases from occurring, leading to a higher number of individuals with the disease in the population. Therefore, the correct statement is that there would be an increase in prevalence (Option D) due to the prolonged duration of the disease despite the decrease in mortality. Incorrect Choices: Decrease in incidence (Option a): Incidence refers to the number of new cases of a disease that occur in a population over a specific period of time. The introduction of a new drug that decreases mortality but does not cure the disease does not directly impact the occurrence of new cases. The drug may improve the survival rate of individuals already diagnosed with the disease, but it does not influence the number of new cases being diagnosed. Therefore, the incidence of the disease would not necessarily decrease as a result of this drug. Decrease in prevalence (Option B): Since the drug does not cure the disease but only decreases mortality, it means that individuals with the disease are living longer. However, the prevalence of the disease is influenced by both the number of new cases and the duration of the disease. If the drug does not impact the number of new cases, the overall prevalence of the disease may not decrease. Increase in incidence (Option C): Similar to option A, the introduction of a new drug that decreases mortality but does not cure the disease does not directly impact the occurrence of new cases. The drug may improve the survival rate of individuals already diagnosed with the disease, but it does not affect the likelihood of new cases developing. Therefore, the incidence of the disease would not necessarily increase due to the introduction of this drug. Reference: Park’s Textbook of Preventive and Social Medicine, 27th Edition, Page 60",

Key maternal and child health indicators : Indicator Definition Formula Significance Maternal Mortality Ratio (MMR) Number of maternal deaths per 100,000 live births Number of maternal deaths ×100,000 —-------------------------------------- I Number of live births Indicator of maternal health and the quality of maternal healthcare services. Infant Mortality Rate (IMR) Number of infant deaths (under 1 year) per 1,000 live births I Number of infant deaths ×1,000 —----------------------------------- Number of live births Reflects the overall health of infants, healthcare quality, and living conditions. Under-5 Mortality Rate (U5MR) Probability of a child dying before age 5 per 1,000 live births Number of under-5 deaths I ×1,000 —------------------------------------ Number of live births Reflects child health and effectiveness of health interventions from birth to age 5. Neonatal Mortality Rate (NMR) Number of deaths of infants aged 0-28 days per 1,000 live births Number of neonatal deaths I ×1,000 —----------------------------------- Number of live births Measures the health of newborns and effectiveness of neonatal care and interventions. Child Mortality Rate (CMR) Number of deaths in children aged 1-4 per 1,000 children in this age group Number of deaths in children aged 1-4 I ×1,000 —------------------------------------------ Total number of children aged 1-4 Reflects mortality due to preventable causes in children aged 1-4 years, indicating health and nutrition status. Stillbirth Rate (SBR) Number of stillbirths per 1,000 live births and stillbirths Number of stillbirths I ×1,000 —------------------------------------------ Number of live births + stillbirths Reflects the quality of prenatal care and the healthcare system’s ability to prevent fetal deaths. Contraceptive Prevalence Rate (CPR) Percentage of women of reproductive age using contraception Number of women using contraception I ×100 —---------------------------------------- Total number of women of reproductive age Indicates access to and usage of family planning, helping reduce maternal and child mortality. Total Fertility Rate (TFR) Average number of children a woman would have over her lifetime Sum of age-specific fertility rates Reflects population growth and reproductive health patterns. Life Expectancy at Birth Average number of years a newborn is expected to live N/A Reflects the overall health and quality of life in a population. Maternal Deaths per 10,000 live births (Option A) : This is incorrect . The maternal mortality ratio is typically measured per 100,000 live births, not 10,000. Maternal Deaths per 10,000 women in reproductive age group (Option C) : This is incorrect . The maternal mortality ratio is not calculated based on the number of women in the reproductive age group, but rather on live births. Maternal Deaths per 100,000 women in reproductive age group (Option D) : This is incorrect . While this measure might seem relevant, it is not the standard definition of maternal mortality ratio. The proper denominator for maternal mortality is live births, not the reproductive age group population.

      "explanation": "Correct Answer C - Incidence remains the same and prevalence increases: Incidence : Refers to the number of new cases of a disease occurring in a specific population during a defined time period. Prevalence : Refers to the total number of cases (both new and existing) in a specific population at a given time. Impact of Prolonging Survival on Incidence and Prevalence: Incidence : The number of new cases of metastatic melanoma is not affected by the treatment. Therefore, the incidence remains the same . Prevalence : Prolonging survival means patients live longer with the disease, resulting in an increase in the total number of cases at any given time . Hence, the prevalence increases . Incidence increases and prevalence reduces (Option A) : This is incorrect because prolonging survival does not increase the number of new cases (incidence), and prevalence cannot reduce when survival increases. Incidence reduces and prevalence remains the same (Option B) : The new treatment does not affect the occurrence of new cases (incidence), and prolonging survival would increase, not stabilize, prevalence. Incidence reduces and prevalence increases (Option D) : The treatment affects survival, not the occurrence of new cases, so the incidence remains unchanged.

      "explanation": "Correct Answer C - Meta-analysis Meta-analysis is considered the most effective quantitative method for examining previous research studies. It involves the statistical combination of results from multiple studies to identify patterns, improve precision, and estimate the overall effect size of a given intervention or exposure. Meta-analysis combines data from various studies, which increases the statistical power and allows for a more comprehensive conclusion than individual studies alone. It provides a quantitative summary of the effects, allowing for a clearer understanding of the consistency and strength of findings across different populations or settings. Systematic reviews , which often precede meta-analysis, are a rigorous method of synthesizing existing research, but meta-analysis takes it a step further by statistically integrating results. Cohort Study (Option A) : This is an observational study design used to follow groups of people over time but is not a method for examining previous research studies. Systematic Review (Option B) : A systematic review is a comprehensive summary of existing research, but it does not necessarily include statistical analysis.

It is calculated by subtracting the lowest value from the highest value , providing a direct measure of the spread or dispersion of the data. Range = Highest value - Lowest value It gives a clear indication of the overall spread of data from the minimum to the maximum. Variance (Option A) : Variance measures the average squared deviation from the mean. While it indicates the spread of data, it does not directly focus on the highest and lowest values. Coefficient of Variation (Option B) : The coefficient of variation is the ratio of the standard deviation to the mean and expresses the variability relative to the mean. It’s useful for comparing relative variability but doesn't focus on the highest and lowest values. Interquartile Range (IQR) (Option D) : The IQR measures the spread of the middle 50% of the data (between the 25th and 75th percentiles). While it indicates the dispersion of the central portion of the data, it does not address the variation between the highest and lowest values as directly as the range.

      "explanation": "Correct Answer: B) Maternal Deaths per 100,000 live births Explanation: The Maternal Mortality Ratio (MMR) is defined as the number of maternal deaths per 100,000 live births . This ratio is used to measure the risk of maternal death during pregnancy, childbirth, or within 42 days after delivery. Formula: MMR = (Maternal deaths / Live births) × 100,000 Maternal death : The death of a woman while pregnant or within 42 days of termination of pregnancy due to any cause related to or aggravated by the pregnancy or its management, but not from accidental or incidental causes. Live births : The total number of live births in a given year. Maternal deaths per 10,000 live births (Option A) : This is an incorrect scale. The standard measure is per 100,000 live births. Maternal deaths per 10,000 women in reproductive age group (Option C) : This is also incorrect. MMR is based on live births, not on women in the reproductive age group. Maternal deaths per 100,000 women in reproductive age group (Option D) : This is not correct because MMR is specifically calculated based on the number of live births, not women in the reproductive age group.

      "explanation": "measures the number of deaths in a population per 1,000 individuals per year. It is calculated by dividing the total number of deaths in a given period by the mid-year population and multiplying by 1,000. CDR = (Number of deaths / Mid-year population) x 1000 Therefore, the mid-year population serves as the denominator in calculating the crude death rate. This rate provides a broad overview of mortality within a population, irrespective of age or other factors. Incorrect Options: CFR (Option B): The case fatality rate (CFR) is a measure of the proportion of individuals diagnosed with a particular disease or condition who die from that disease or condition within a specified time period. It is calculated by dividing the number of deaths from the disease by the number of diagnosed cases and multiplying by 100 to get a percentage. CFR is commonly used in epidemiology and public health to assess the severity of a disease outbreak or epidemic. MMR (Option C): The maternal mortality rate (MMR) is a measure of the number of maternal deaths per 100,000 live births. It reflects the risk associated with childbirth and pregnancy-related complications. MMR is an important indicator of maternal health and healthcare system performance, especially in developing countries where maternal mortality rates tend to be higher. NMR (Option D): The neonatal mortality rate (NMR) is a measure of the number of deaths among newborns (within the first 28 days of life) per 1,000 live births. It specifically focuses on mortality during the neonatal period, which is critical for assessing the quality of maternal and newborn healthcare services. NMR is an essential indicator for monitoring progress in reducing infant mortality and improving newborn health outcomes.

Continuous data can include decimal values and can theoretically take on an infinite number of possible values within the specified range. Examples of continuous data include height, weight, temperature, and blood cholesterol levels (measured in mg/dL or mmol/L). In the context of blood cholesterol levels, they are measured on a continuous scale because they can take on any value within a range (e.g., from 100 mg/dL to 300 mg/dL) and can be measured with a high degree of precision using laboratory methods. Incorrect Options: Ordinal (Option A): Ordinal data refers to data that have a defined order or ranking but the differences between the values are not meaningful or consistent. For example, ranking students based on their exam scores (1st, 2nd, 3rd, etc.) represents ordinal data because while there is a ranking order, the difference in scores between students may not be uniform or meaningful. Nominal (Option B): Nominal data refers to categorical data where the categories are unordered and have no inherent numerical value. For example, colors (red, blue, green) or types of fruits (apple, banana, orange) represent nominal data because there is no inherent order or ranking among the categories. Discrete (Option C): Discrete data refers to data that can only take specific, distinct values and cannot take on values between these points. Discrete data are usually counts of items or events and are typically represented by whole numbers. For example, the number of students in a classroom or the number of cars in a parking lot are examples of discrete data.

      "explanation": "studies and it is studied using a cohort study. In case-control studies, researchers start with individuals who already have the outcome of interest (cases) and compare them to individuals without the outcome (controls). This retrospective design makes it challenging to establish causality because the exposure may have occurred before or after the disease developed, leaving the relationship unclear. Additionally, since participants are not followed over time, the study cannot confirm whether the exposure directly caused the outcome. Thus, case-control studies are more suited for identifying associations rather than proving causal relationships. Case-Control study: Advantages Disadvantages Less time taken. Inexpensive. Minimal ethical problems. Multiple exposure was studied. Rare diseases can be studied. Attrition bias not present Forms the rationale for prevention and control programmes based on risk factors. Selection bias. Recall bias. Interviewer bias. Cannot measure incidence: Only provides estimation of relative risk. Cannot differentiate between causes and associated factors Incorrect Options: Effect to cause (Option A): Case-control study precedes backward from effect to cause, hence it is also called effect to cause study. Rare Disease (Option B): Rare Diseases can be studied using case-control. Odds ratio (Option C): Odds ratio is used to analyze and interpret the case-control study.

Height is a quantitative or continuous variable (can take many possible values and also in between values) It can be expressed in decimals and there is no gap in between. Bar Diagram (Option A): Simple bar diagrams represent the frequency of discrete variables like gender. Discrete variables:These variables take fewer values and no in between values. Examples: Religion, Blood groups These are not represented in decimals so there are gaps. Regression analysis (Option C): It is a statistical technique used to describe relationships between variables. It represents unitary change. It quantifies how changes in one variable are associated with changes in another variable(s). It provides insights into the direction (positive or negative correlation) and strength (the magnitude of the relationship) between variables. (Option A) The process involves fitting a mathematical model to observed data to describe the effect of ≥ 1 independent variable on a dependent variable.

It categorizes items into three groups: A Items: These are items that are of high value or importance but typically represent a smaller portion of the total items. In the context of the question, A drugs receive the largest allocation of the budget (35,000 Rs), and they would be classified as \"A Items\" in an ABC analysis due to their high value. B Items: These are items of moderate value or importance and constitute a moderate portion of the total items. B drugs receive a budget of 10,000 Rs, which is less than A drugs but still represents a considerable portion of the total budget. They would be classified as \"B Items\" in an ABC analysis. C Items: These are items of lower value or importance and typically make up a larger portion of the total items. In the question, the remaining amount after allocating for A and B drugs is meant for C drugs. Since the remaining amount is smaller, C drugs would be classified as \"C Items\" in an ABC analysis. Incorrect Options: Option A - Network Analysis: Network analysis involves the study of interconnected activities and their relationships in a project or process. It's used to optimize scheduling and resource allocation in complex projects. This option is not applicable to the scenario described in the question. Option C - VED Analysis: VED Analysis is used in inventory management to categorize items into three groups based on their criticality: V (Vital) Items: These are items that are essential for the operation and should be available at all times to avoid disruptions. This analysis doesn't directly apply to the allocation of a budget among different types of drugs. E (Essential) Items: These are important items but may have alternatives or substitutes available. They are not as critical as Vital items. D (Desirable) Items: These are items with relatively lower criticality, and their absence might not significantly impact operations.

Case reports describe and analyze individual cases or small groups of cases, providing valuable insights into rare diseases, unusual presentations of common diseases, and unexpected treatment outcomes. Consort: Stands for Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials. It is a guideline designed to improve the transparency and reporting of randomized controlled trials (RCTs). It provides a checklist and flow diagram to ensure that essential information about the design, conduct, analysis, and interpretation of RCTs is reported in a standardised and comprehensive manner. Prisma: Stands for Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses. It is a guideline that aims to improve the transparency and reporting of systematic reviews and meta-analyses. PRISMA provides a checklist and flow diagram to ensure that researchers accurately report their systematic reviews and meta-analyses' methods, results, and interpretations. Strobe/Moose: STROBE stands for Strengthening the Reporting of Observational Studies in Epidemiology, while MOOSE stands for Meta-analysis of Observational Studies in Epidemiology. These guidelines provide recommendations for reporting observational studies, including cohort, case-control, and cross-sectional studies. STROBE and MOOSE guidelines help researchers ensure that they report relevant information about the design, conduct, analysis, and interpretation of observational studies, thus enhancing the transparency and reproducibility of their findings.

Prospective cohort study (Option B): In this study, the disease has not yet occurred when the investigation has started. The investigation starts from the present and proceeds to the future. A few examples are study on smoking and lung cancer, study of oral contraceptives and health. Case-control study (Option C): It starts with the disease and, hence it proceeds from effect to cause.
