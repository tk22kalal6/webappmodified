      "explanation": "multiple dengue cases Correct Answer: C) A. aegypti, being a discordant feeder, results in clustering and generation of multiple dengue cases Explanation: Epidemiology of Dengue: Agent factors Infection with any one serotype (DENV-1, 2, 3, and 4) confers lifelong immunity to that virus serotype (No cross-immunity) Secondary infection with serotype 2 or multiple infections with different serotypes leads to severe immunological catastrophe. (DHF/DSS) Vector 1. Aedes aegypti: Less aggressive Nervous feeder, discordant feeder (needs >1 feed): clustering of dengue cases ( Option C ) Striped body appearance Breed: Stagnant artificial water collections like tires, pots, buckets, etc. ( Option A ) Flight range: Short range-100 meters. Eggs: single and cigar-shaped Larvae: siphon tube 2. Aedes albopictus: More aggressive Concordant feeder (1 feed is enough) Disease transmission Infective stage: Reservoir: Man: day before symptom onset to 5th day Mosquito: remain infective lifetime (transovarial transmission) Transmission cycle: Man-mosquito-man Incubation period: 3 to 10 days Host Factors Children have a milder disease than adults. ( Option D) High risk: infants, elderly, obese, pregnant, peptic ulcer disease, menstrual disease, congenital disease, hemolytic diseases, NSAIDs. Environmental Factors Humidity - 60 to 80% Temperature - 16 to 30 0 C (Option B) Endophagic and endophilic 2°C increase in temperature: shortens extrinsic incubation period of infected mosquitoes Rural spread is associated with water supply development, improved transport, and water scarcity.",

      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: A) Rapid antigen detection test Explanation: A rapid antigen detection test (NS1) is used to diagnose dengue fever within 5 days of onset of fever. Dengue presents with high fever, severe headache, joint pain (breakbone fever), rash, and a positive tourniquet test. Laboratory findings often show leukopenia, thrombocytopenia, and elevated liver enzymes. Clinical presentation of Dengue: Uncategorized fever No typical features Break bone fever (Classical dengue fever/ acute viral infection) Retro orbital pain Arthralgia Severe myalgia and headache Bimodal presentation of fever: 39-40°C, peaks on days 1-2 Resurges: day 5-6 Recovery: day 7-10. Rash: pin-point eruptions on the face, neck and chest followed by maculopapular or scarlatiniform on 3rd or 4th day. Dengue hemorrhagic syndrome Dengue fever + hemorrhagic manifestations(bleeding from any orifice) Rash: Maculopapular/ Rubelliform Lab Diagnosis 20% increase in hematocrit Thrombocytopenia (<1 lac) Clinical diagnosis Tourniquet test - >10 petechiae/ sq inch area Dengue shock syndrome Pulse pressure - <20 mmHg Mean systolic pressure - <90mmHg: adults, <80 mmHg: children. Blood culture (Option B) is not used to diagnose dengue fever, as it is a viral infection, not bacterial. PCR for malaria (Option C) parasites is used to diagnose malaria. The patient presents with a shorter-duration fever and hepatosplenomegaly, not with a positive tourniquet test. IgM ELISA (Option D) is used to diagnose dengue after >5 days of symptoms.

      "explanation": "measure the density of larvae in a given area. Correct Answer: A) Larval indices, such as the Breteau index, House index, and Container index, measure the density of larvae in a given area. Explanation: Larval indices, such as the Breteau index, House index, and Container index, are used to identify the transmission possibilities of dengue in a certain area. Larval surveillance helps identify areas with high mosquito densities and implement targeted vector control measures. Larval Surveillance and Vector control: Larval Surveillance (density of larvae in the area) Sampling unit: Houses or premises searched for water-holding containers . House index : Number of houses positive for aedes larvae/number of houses searched. (Option B) Container index: Number of containers positive/ number of containers checked. Breteau index : The number of positive containers, and the number of houses checked. Most sensitive to assess endemicity (Option C). Aedes Aegypti Index: Percentage of houses and their premises showing actual breeding of A. aegypti larvae.

      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: B) Administer two doses of rabies vaccine on days 0 and 3. Explanation: The management of re-exposure depends on the timing and nature of previous vaccinations. 1. Re-Exposure Prophylaxis within 3 Months: If a patient who has been bitten by an animal suspected to be rabid has completed a full rabies vaccination series within the last three months. No Further Vaccination Required: The immune response from the initial series is still strong, providing sufficient protection. If necessary, only the wound should be cleaned thoroughly, and tetanus prophylaxis should be considered. 2. Re-Exposure Prophylaxis After 3 Months: Wound Care on day 0 Administration of Two Booster Doses of the rabies vaccine. Day 0: first dose. Day 3: Second dose. This booster regimen helps to reinforce the patient's immunity, ensuring continued protection against the rabies virus. Rabies Immunoglobulin (RIG): RIG is not required for patients who have previously completed a rabies vaccination series. RIG is typically reserved for those who have never been vaccinated or have incomplete vaccination histories.

      "explanation": "Correct Answer: A) Mass vaccination of domestic dogs and cats Explanation: The most effective step to control the disease and prevent its transmission is Mass vaccination of domestic dogs and cats. Prevents Transmission at the Source: Many of these animals can be vaccinated, achieving herd immunity. This means that even if an occasional rabid animal enters the community, it will be less likely to transmit the disease. Cost-Effective and Sustainable Ethical Considerations: Culling of stray animals is considered to be unethical (Option B). Quarantine (Option C) can be impractical and resource-intensive for managing suspected rabid animals. In the case of exotic animals quarantine period are implemented. Public awareness campaigns (Option D) are important but are secondary to controlling the disease at its source through vaccination. Control methods used to limit the spread of rabies in a population: Pre-exposure vaccination: Administering rabies vaccine to individuals at risk of exposure (e.g., veterinarians, animal handlers). Animal Control Measures (Stray animals) Mass Vaccination: promoting herd immunity Euthanasia/Culling of stray dogs and cats to reduce the reservoir of rabies in urban areas. Public Awareness and Education. Pet vaccination. Educational campaigns. Surveillance and Monitoring. Quarantine and Isolation: Separating confirmed rabid animals to prevent contact with other animals and humans. Mandatory vaccination laws: Enforcing laws that require pet owners to vaccinate their pets against rabies. Reference: Park's Textbook of Preventive and Social Medicine, 27th edition, Page 326-327",

      "question": "A district has a population of 7,50,000, among which 56,000 smears were prepared last year to detect malaria. What is this population's annual blood examination rate (ABER) for last year?",
      "options": {
        "A": "7.5%",
        "B": "8.4%",
        "C": "8.8%",
        "D": "9.5%"
      },
      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: A) 7.5% Explanation: Hence, ABER = 56000*100/750000 = 7.5% approximately It is a direct measure of the implementation efficiency of disease screening strategies. ABER (at least 10%) : Ensures adequate operational efficiency. Reference: Park’s Textbook of Preventive and Social Medicine, 27th edition, Page 306",

      "question": "In a town of 4000 people in the last month, malarial smears have been prepared for 600 people who suffered acute febrile illness episodes, among which 85 were found to be positive for vivax, 25 for ovale and 10 for falciparum malaria. What is the updated slide positivity rate in this population?",
      "options": {
        "A": "10%",
        "B": "15%",
        "C": "20%",
        "D": "25%"
      },
      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: C) 20% Explanation: Here, SPR = 120*100/600 = 20% Slide positivity rate can be considered an index of the malarial incidence in a population. Hence, effective vector control strategies can be devised based on its rise and fall. It can also serve as an effective tool during the malarial outbreaks. Note: Slide falciparum rate has the same purpose mentioned above but is useful only for falciparum malaria. Reference: Park’s Textbook of Preventive and Social Medicine, 27th edition, Page 307",
