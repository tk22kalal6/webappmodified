      "explanation": "Correct answer: B) Systematic error in determining an association between exposure and disease the association between exposure and outcome. It does not occur by chance and cannot be eliminated by increasing the sample size. Reflects a type of non-comparability between study and control groups. This can skew the study results → False conclusions, and threaten validity. Types of Bias Subject Bias Investigator Bias Analysis Bias Recall bias Hawthorne bias Reporting bias Non-response bias Selection bias Berksonian Neyman Reporting Publication bias Misclassification bias Interviewer bias Pygmalion bias Golem bias (blunting of response due to demotivated observer) Statistical bias Random variation in data collection and measurement refers to the natural fluctuation seen with sampling errors. (Option A) The odds ratio measures the strength of the association between risk factors and outcomes. (Option C) Exposure rate, defined as a direct estimation of the frequency of exposure between disease and non-disease groups, may be calculated in a case-control study.

      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Correct answer: B) Excluding cases who had CVD in the past but have since died or fully recovered. excludes individuals who have died or recovered from the disease. Missing cases lead to an underestimation of the true association. Berksonian bias (Option C) A selection bias by choosing hospitalised patients with multiple comorbidities as the study population Leads to a distorted association between exposure and outcome. Reporting bias (Option A) Information reporting is influenced by the knowledge of the desired outcome or the interest of the researchers. E.g., CVD patients may attribute their condition to past dietary habits leading to high-fat consumption, while those without CVD may underreport unhealthy eating habits. Publication bias (Option D) Studies with positive or significant results are more likely to be published than studies with negative or non-significant results. This leads to an overrepresentation of studies showing a strong association between high-fat diets and CVD, potentially misleading readers.

      },
      "correct_answer": "D",
      "explanation": "Correct answer: D) Pygmalion Bias Explanation: Pygmalion Bias occurs when the researcher's expectations influence participant performance. This bias is irrelevant to case-control studies, which are retrospective and observational and more susceptible to biases like recall, selection, and ascertainment bias. Pygmalion Bias/ Rosenthal Effect: A phenomenon where higher researcher expectations increase participant performance or outcomes. Motivation is proportional to performance and gives an exaggerated response. Seen in experimental or educational settings. For example, increased motivation by teachers increases student performance. Recall Bias (Option A) occurs when participants do not accurately remember past events or experiences. It is common in case-control studies where cases might remember exposure more clearly than controls. Selection Bias (Option B) Happens when there is a systematic difference in characteristics between those selected for study and those not. It is possible that the cases and controls are not representative of the general population. Surveillance Bias or Ascertainment bias (Option C) Occurs when the disease or outcome is more likely to be identified in the exposed group because they are more closely monitored. This could occur if cases are more frequently monitored for dietary habits than controls. Reference: Woods NS, Pygmalion in the cradle https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9717138/",

      "question": "A research study monitors smoking cessation among participants using daily self-reporting. Despite being heavy smokers outside the study, participants consistently report reduced cigarette consumption during the study period. What phenomenon is likely influencing these findings?",
      "options": {
        "A": "Hawthorne effect",
        "B": "Ascertainment bias",
        "C": "Interviewer bias",
        "D": "Recall bias"
      },
      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "Correct answer: A) Hawthorne effect Explanation: The given scenario shows smokers modifying their behaviour during observation in a study, and it is suggestive of Hawthorne effect. Hawthorne effect: Individuals modify their behaviour due to awareness of being observed. Seen in cohort studies. In this scenario, participants may decrease their reported cigarette consumption due to being monitored rather than reflecting their actual smoking habits outside the study context. Ascertainment bias (Option B) or observer bias occurs when the investigator's knowledge of exposure or outcome influences their assessment of study outcomes, less likely seen in cohort studies where exposure is assessed before the outcome occurs. Interviewer bias (Option C) is mostly seen in case-control studies, where interviewers know the disease status and consciously or unconsciously influence the responses of participants. Recall bias (Option D) occurs when participants with a disease recall past exposures differently when they know their disease status is associated with case-control studies.

        "D": "It avoids selection bias"
      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Correct answer: B) It avoids both subject and observer bias Explanation: Double blinding in clinical trials prevents observer and subject bias by ensuring participants and researchers are unaware of the treatment or placebo, thereby preventing influenced behaviour or symptoms. Blinding levels in Clinical trials 1. Single-blinded blinding Participants are unaware of the intervention Prevent biases that arise from knowledge of the treatment. 2. Double-blinded blinding Both the researchers and participants are unaware of the intervention given (prevents observer and subject bias) ( Option B and C) Most common form of blinding Avoids performance bias (associated with knowledge of treatment) ( Option A) 3. Triple-blinded blinding Researchers, participants, and analysers are unaware of the intervention. The best form of blinding. Selection bias is avoided by randomisation, which arises when the participants are not representative of the target population. (Option D) Reference: Blinding levels in Clinical trials",

      },
      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Correct answer: C) Confounding factor Explanation: Confounding factor : It is an external variable that influences both the Independent variable (Coffee) and Dependent variable(Heart disease incidence), creating a false association between them. It can distort the true relationship between these variables. Importance: Identifying and addressing confounders is crucial to ensuring a study's internal validity. Internal validity refers to the extent to which a study accurately reflects the true causal relationship between variables without the influence of other extraneous factors. In this case, smoking status can confound the relationship between coffee consumption and heart disease because smokers are more likely to drink coffee and also more likely to have heart disease. Causal variable (Option A) refers to a factor that directly causes a change in the studied outcome. In this case, coffee drinking could be considered a causal variable if it directly affects heart disease risk. Random error (Option B) refers to variability in research outcomes that occurs by chance rather than systematic factors. Spurious correlation (Option D) occurs when two variables appear to be correlated but have no causal relationship.

      "explanation": "Correct answer: C) 1-c, 2-b, 3-d, 4-a Explanation: Techniques To Eliminate Confounders Method Description Examples Matching Cases are matched with the control and should be similar to the control in every possible variable that can affect the study's outcome except the disease in question. Done in a case-control study. Eliminates only the known confounders. In a study on the effect of a new teaching method, students are matched based on their prior academic performance and then assigned to different groups. Restriction Limits participation in the study to individuals who are similar in terms of confounders. In a study, Restricting the study to only non-smokers will eliminate the effect of smoking. Randomisation The technique where every participant will get an equal and known chance of being allocated to either the treatment group or the control group. Eliminates both known and unknown confounders. In a clinical trial, patients are randomly assigned to receive either a new drug or a placebo, balancing out confounding variables. Stratification (Segregate) Stratify the participants of the study or segregate them. In a clinical trial, to eliminate the effect of smoking as a confounder, one can further stratify or segregate participants into smokers and non-smokers. Standardisation Adjusting the results to a standard population to control for confounding variables often used in rate comparisons Eliminate or control the effect of age and gender. In a study comparing mortality rates between two countries, rates are standardised to a common age distribution to control for age differences. Multivariate regression models Used when there are multiple confounders. In an observational diet and heart disease study, a regression model is used to adjust for age, gender, and physical activity.

      "question": "A study investigating the relationship between smoking and lung cancer found that the association was stronger in individuals who exercised less and weaker in those who exercised more. In this context, what role does exercise play?",
      "options": {
        "A": "Confounding Variable",
        "B": "Effect Modifier",
        "C": "Spurious Association",
        "D": "None of the above"
      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Correct answer: B) Effect Modifier Explanation: Effect Modifier changes the strength or direction of the association between an exposure and an outcome. Here, exercise modifies the association between smoking and lung cancer, making it stronger in those who exercise less and weaker in those who exercise more. Effect modifier: It is a variable that differentially (positively and negatively) modifies the observed effect of a risk factor on disease status. Features: The magnitude of the effect of an exposure on the outcome will vary according to the presence of a third factor (effect modifier). For effect modification, true relation must be there between the outcome(disease) and independent variable (risk factor). Confounding Variable (Option A) influences both the independent variable and the dependent variable, potentially giving a misleading impression of an association. In this scenario, exercise does not confound the relationship between smoking and lung cancer; rather, it modifies the strength of this association. Spurious Association (Option C) refers to an apparent association due to chance or other factors not accounted for in the study. The observed relationship here is not spurious as it is systematically influenced by the level of exercise. Reference: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5476432/",

      "question": "In a mountainous region, many residents suffer from endemic goitre. What type of association best describes the relationship between living at high altitudes and the prevalence of goitre in these residents?",

      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Correct answer: B) Indirect Association Explanation: Indirect Association: The prevalence of goitre at high altitudes is indirectly associated with Third Variable (iodine deficiency), which is common in mountainous regions due to the lack of iodine in the soil and, consequently, in the food and water. The high altitude does not directly cause goitre; instead, the iodine deficiency leads to the condition. Association: Occurance of 2 variable more often than expected by chance Measured by OR, correlation coefficient, p value The importance of association is as follows. Identifying Risk Factors. Formulating Hypotheses. Public Health Interventions. Resource Allocation. Epidemiological Surveillance. Types of Association: Type of Association Description 1. Spurious (Option A) An association that appears to be present but is actually due to chance or an error in data. Ice cream sales and drowning incidents : Higher ice cream sales are associated with more drowning incidents, but this is spurious. The real factor is summer, which increases both swimming activity and ice cream sales. 2. Indirect (Option B) An association in which a third variable (known as the confounding variable) causes both the predictor and the outcome. Coffee consumption and heart disease : Initial studies suggested coffee consumption is linked to heart disease. However, smoking (a confounder) was later found to be more prevalent among coffee drinkers and the real cause of the observed association. 3. Direct (Causal) An association where the predictor directly influences the outcome. Smoking and lung cancer : Smoking directly increases the risk of lung cancer through the inhalation of carcinogens. a. One-to-One causal (Option C) A direct causal link between a single predictor and a single outcome. Vitamin C deficiency and scurvy : Lack of vitamin C (predictor) directly causes scurvy (outcome). b. Multifactorial An association involving multiple factors contributing to the outcome. Reference: Park’s Textbook of Preventive and Social Medicine, 26th edition, Pages 95-99",
