Domestic Refrigerator Usage Details Vaccine Storage Can be used for storing vaccines at private clinics and nursing homes, but hold-over time and capacity are limited. Requires a guaranteed continuous power supply. Temperature Range Maintains a cabinet temperature between +2°C to +8°C. Placement of Vaccines (Options A, B, C, D) Top Shelf : Measles, BCG, Rotavirus vaccine, OPV Middle Shelf : DPT, Pentavalent vaccine, TT, IPV, Hepatitis B, and diluents placed next to their corresponding vaccines. Bottom Shelf : Water-filled ice packs to help maintain temperature stability. Door : Avoid storing vaccines in the door as they experience the most temperature fluctuation Ice Pack Usage Place ice packs filled with water on the bottom shelf and in the refrigerator door to help maintain the temperature in case of a power outage.

      "explanation": "Rotavirus (A) Oral (ii) → Given as oral drops. BCG (B) Intradermal (iv) → Given in the left upper arm. Japanese Encephalitis (JE) (C) Subcutaneous (i) → Given in the upper arm. Pentavalent (D) Intramuscular (iii) → Given in the anterolateral thigh. Vaccine Administration Routes and Their Importance Vaccines are administered through different routes based on their formulation and intended immune response. The choice of route ensures optimal immune activation while minimizing adverse effects. Below is a detailed breakdown of vaccines, their administration routes, doses, and sites: Route Vaccine Dose Site Oral OPV (Oral Polio Vaccine) 2 drops Oral Rotavirus 5 drops Oral Intradermal BCG (Bacillus Calmette-Guérin) 0.1 ml (0.05 ml until 1 month) Left upper arm fIPV (Fractional IPV) 0.1 ml Right upper arm Intramuscular Pentavalent (DPT, Hep B, Hib) 0.5 ml Antero-lateral side of mid-thigh PCV (Pneumococcal Conjugate Vaccine) 0.5 ml Antero-lateral side of mid-thigh Td (Tetanus and Diphtheria) 0.5 ml Upper arm Subcutaneous MR (Measles-Rubella) 0.5 ml Right upper arm JE (Japanese Encephalitis) 0.5 ml Left upper arm (Live vaccine via S.C) Killed vaccine via I.M- Anterolateral thigh (<3 years, IM); Deltoid ( ≥ 3 years, IM) Intranasal Influenza 0.2 ml (0.1 ml each nostril) Nasopharynx Oral vaccines (OPV, Rotavirus) stimulate gut immunity and are given as drops. Intradermal vaccines (BCG, fIPV) create a localized immune response, essential for tuberculosis prevention (BCG). Intramuscular vaccines (Pentavalent, PCV, Td) require deep penetration into the muscle to enhance systemic immunity. Subcutaneous vaccines (MR, JE) are injected into fatty tissue to enable slower antigen release. Intranasal vaccines (Influenza) mimic natural infection routes, triggering mucosal immunity.",

      "question": "Under the Vitamin A distribution scheme, which of the following is the appropriate dose of Vitamin A to prevent blindness in a 3-year-old?",
      "options": {
        "A": "100,000 IU",
        "B": "150,000 IU",
        "C": "200,000 IU",
        "D": "50,000 IU"
      },
      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: C) 200,000 IU Explanation: Vitamin A supplementation is essential to prevent blindness and reduce childhood mortality . Under the National Vitamin A Prophylaxis Program , children aged 1 to 5 years receive 200,000 IU every 6 months as a preventive measure. This dose is crucial for preventing xerophthalmia, night blindness, and severe infections associated with Vitamin A deficiency. Vitamin A Supplementation Schedule in Children Age Dosage (Oral Route) < 6 months 50,000 IU 6 - 12 months 100,000 IU 9 months (with measles vaccine) 100,000 IU 1 - 5 years (every 6 months) 200,000 IU Treatment of Vitamin A Deficiency: Oral 200,000 IU on 2 successive days All children with corneal ulcers should receive Vitamin A , regardless of suspected deficiency. 100,000 IU (Option A): Incorrect. This dose is recommended only at 9 months , not for a 3-year-old. 150,000 IU (Option B): Incorrect. This is not a recommended standard dose. 50,000 IU (Option D): Incorrect. This is the dose for infants under 6 months , not a 3-year-old. Reference: Park’s Textbook of Preventive and Social Medicine 27th edition, page no: 459",

      "question": "Consider the following statements: i) f IPV is a live attenuated vaccine. ii) fIPV is not effective in control of epidemics iii) OPV has a shorter shelf life than IPV iv) fIPV provides humoral immunity only v) 5 ml of fIPV is administered via IM route Which of the following are correct?",
      "options": {
        "A": "i, ii and iii",
        "B": "ii, iii and iv",
        "C": "ii, iii and v",
        "D": "i, iii and v"
      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "(inactivated) vaccine, not a live attenuated vaccine. OPV (Oral Poliovirus Vaccine) is the live attenuated form. ii) fIPV is not effective in control of epidemics: Correct Fractional IPV (fIPV) is not ideal for rapid outbreak control because it does not induce sufficient mucosal immunity , which is required for halting poliovirus transmission. OPV is preferred in epidemic situations due to its ability to induce gut immunity and stop transmission. iii) OPV has a shorter shelf life than IPV: Correct OPV is a live virus vaccine , requiring strict cold chain maintenance and has a shorter shelf life than IPV, which is inactivated and more stable. iv) fIPV provides humoral immunity only: Correct fIPV induces humoral (systemic) immunity but does not provide strong mucosal immunity in the intestines, which is necessary to prevent virus shedding. OPV provides both humoral and mucosal immunity. v) 5 ml of fIPV is administered via IM route: Incorrect fIPV is given as 0.1 ml intradermally , not 5 ml intramuscularly . The standard full-dose IPV (not fractional) is given intramuscularly (IM) . Differences Between IPV and OPV Feature IPV (Inactivated Poliovirus Vaccine) OPV (Oral Poliovirus Vaccine) Type of Vaccine Inactivated (killed) virus Live attenuated virus Route of Administration Intramuscular (IM) or Intradermal (ID) Oral (drops) Immunity Provided Systemic (humoral) immunity Systemic + mucosal immunity (gut immunity) Effectiveness in Epidemics Not effective in stopping transmission Highly effective in epidemic control Prevention of Virus Shedding Limited effect on intestinal virus shedding Strong gut immunity prevents shedding Shelf Life & Storage More stable, longer shelf life Less stable, requires strict cold chain Risk of Vaccine-Derived Poliovirus (VDPV) No risk of VDPV Small risk of VDPV due to live virus reversion Use in Eradication Programs Primarily used in polio-free areas Used in endemic and outbreak settings Schedule of OPV and fIPV OPV Schedule : Administered at 6 weeks, 10 weeks, 14 weeks, 16–24 months, and 5 years (2 oral drops per dose). fIPV (Fractional IPV) Schedule : First and second doses at 6 weeks and 14 weeks (0.1 ml intradermally in the right upper arm). Fractional dose : 1/5th of the total IPV dose. From January 1, 2023 , a third IPV dose has been introduced at 9 completed months (0.1 ml intradermally in the left upper arm, since MR vaccine is administered in the right upper arm). Rationale for the Shift from OPV to IPV OPV contains live, weakened poliovirus, which can mutate and cause vaccine-associated paralytic polio (VAPP) or lead to outbreaks due to vaccine-derived poliovirus (VDPV) . IPV contains inactivated",
