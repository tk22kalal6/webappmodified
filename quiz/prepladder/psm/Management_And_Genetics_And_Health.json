The best way to dispose of sputum is incineration as it falls under infectious bodily waste. (Option A) Incineration is not suitable for Pressurized gas containers.

      "explanation": "Correct Answer: B) Eugenics Explanation: Eugenics is a field that seeks to improve the genetic composition of a human population by encouraging the reproduction of people with desirable traits (positive eugenics) and discouraging or preventing the reproduction of people with undesirable traits (negative eugenics). Positive Eugenics The goal is to increase the prevalence of desirable traits in the population over generations. This can be encouraged through various means such as: Financial and political stimuli Targeted demographic analyses In vitro fertilisation Egg transplants Gene cloning Negative Eugenics The objective is to reduce the frequency of hereditary disease and disability in the community. This could involve measures such as: Abortions Sterilizations Other methods of family planning Euthenics (Option A) focuses on improving human health and well-being by enhancing environmental and living conditions rather than altering genetic traits. This includes- prevention and removal of contagious diseases and parasites, environmentalism, education regarding home economics, sanitation and housing (environmental manipulation). Epigenetics (Option C) : Study of changes in gene expression caused by mechanisms other than changes in the underlying DNA sequence. Ethnology (Option D) : Scientific study of the origins and cultures of different races and ethnicities. Reference: Park’s Textbook of Preventive and Social Medicine, 27th Ed. Pg. 954",

      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: C) Allele frequencies vary within a species Explanation: The Hardy-Weinberg law states that the genotype and allele frequencies remain constant in a population from generation to generation in the absence of evolutionary forces. It assumes that the population is stable and large, random mating occurs, no mutations affect the gene pool, no migration occurs, and natural selection does not act on the alleles. Hardy-Weinberg Principle: provides a quantitative framework for predicting genotype frequencies based on allele frequencies in a non-evolving population. The formula is expressed as: p 2 +2pq+q 2 = 1, where p and q represent the frequencies of two alleles (denoted as dominant and recessive), and p 2, 2pq,and q 2 represent the frequencies of the three possible genotypes. Frequency of homozygous dominant genotype + frequency of homozygous recessive genotype + frequency of heterozygous genotype = 1 Reference: Anecdotal, Historical and Critical Commentaries on Genetics: G.
