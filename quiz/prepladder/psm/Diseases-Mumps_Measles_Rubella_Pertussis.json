      "explanation": "vaccine Components Diphtheria toxoid: 25 Lf (limit of flocculation). Tetanus toxoid: 5 Lf. Pertussis killed acellular bacilli: 20,000 million. Dose 0.5 ml Route of administration Intramuscular Site Anterolateral aspect of left thigh Schedule Can be given as DPT or pentavalent vaccine at 6 weeks, 10 weeks, 14 weeks. 1st booster dose at 16-24 months. 2d booster dose at 5-6 years. In case of delayed vaccination, DPT can be given till 7 years of age while PENTAVALENT can be given up to 1 year of age only. Adjuvant Aluminum phosphate (2.5 mg): Increases immunogenicity of vaccine Preservative Thiomersal (0.01%) Adverse effects Fever and mild local reaction common following DPT vaccine. Due to pertussis component : Inconsolable cry, Reye’s syndrome, Hypotensive hyporesponsive encephalopathy (HHE) (option D). Contraindications If severe reactions such as collapse/shock, temperature > 40°C and anaphylaxis occurred after the previous dose. In such cases, the next part of the vaccine should not contain the pertussis component. Persistent inconsolable crying for more than 2 hours following DPT/pentavalent vaccination is not an absolute contraindication to subsequent doses. Intussusception (Option A): is commonly a potential side effect seen with the Rotavirus vaccine. Toxic shock syndrome (Option B): is seen with the MMR vaccine. Guillain-Barré syndrome (Option C): is more commonly associated with Influenza vaccine. Reference: Parks Textbook of Preventive and Social Medicine 27th edition Page no: 180",

Enhance ownership and accountability for measles and rubella targets and boost community vaccination demand. Identify and address immunity gaps through healthcare contact points and targeted outreach to underserved communities. Adopt a life-course approach for second-dose delivery and integrate it with other health initiatives. Ensure outbreak preparedness for timely detection and effective response.
