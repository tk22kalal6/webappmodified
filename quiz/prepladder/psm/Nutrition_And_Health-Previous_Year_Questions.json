The resolution of symptoms with the administration of vitamins A and C, along with essential amino acids, is consistent with this diagnosis. Incorrect Options: Option B - Rickets: This is a condition resulting from vitamin D deficiency, leading to weak and soft bones in children. Symptoms include bone deformities and growth retardation, but it does not typically present with papules on the extensor surfaces. Option C - Kwashiorkor: This is a form of protein-energy malnutrition characterized by edema, irritability, and skin changes. It usually involves more generalized symptoms of malnutrition rather than isolated papules that resolve with vitamins and amino acids. Option D - Marasmus: This is another form of severe malnutrition caused by a deficiency in caloric intake, leading to severe weight loss and muscle wasting. It does not present with papules but rather with severe overall wasting.

      "explanation": "their high biological value. They are considered a complete protein source as they contain all essential amino acids in optimal ratios. Egg protein is highly bioavailable and contains important nutrients such as vitamins, minerals, and antioxidants. Egg Importance Eggs are highly nutritious and rich in protein, essential vitamins, & minerals. They support muscle building, brain health, and overall wellness. NPU of egg is 96 (~ almost equal to 100) Rule of 6 6 grams of protein 6 grams of fat 60 calories per large egg 6 essential vitamins (A, B2, B12, D, E, K) 60 grams average weight Others: 6x5=30 mg Calcium 6x0.25=1.5mg Iron Eggs are easy to digest and have high bioavailability, meaning the body can efficiently absorb and utilise the protein. Net Protein Utilization (NPU): Digestibility coefficient (external indicator) x Biological value (internal indicator) / 100 Percentage of the ingested nitrogen retained in the body 1 gm protein = 6.25gm nitrogen NPU Indian diet: 50-80 Pulses (Option A): Pulses, such as lentils, chickpeas, and beans, are a rich source of plant-based protein. While they provide essential amino acids, they are generally considered to have lower biological value compared to animal-based proteins. This is because pulses are deficient in one or more essential amino acids, particularly methionine. Soybean (Option B): While soybean protein is of higher quality among plant-based sources, it still does not match the BV of animal-based proteins due to slightly lower digestibility and bioavailability. Milk (Option C): Milk has a high BV (around 85–90) because it contains all essential amino acids in a good ratio and is easily digestible. Milk protein, particularly casein and whey, is of high quality and supports tissue repair and growth effectively. However, its biological value is slightly lower than egg.

Promotes absorption of non-haem iron in plant foods eaten concurrently. Non-Haem iron: It is found in plant-based foods such as cereals, green leafy vegetables (Option B ruled out) , legumes (Option C ruled out) , nuts, oilseeds, jaggery, and dried fruits. Additional Iron Sources : Cooking in iron vessels can significantly contribute to dietary iron in some areas. Iron Content in Milk : Low in all mammalian species. (Option D) Breast milk contains less than 0.2 mg/dL but has good bioavailability. Bioavailability and Absorption Inhibitors : Non-haem iron absorption is hindered by phytates, oxalates, carbonates, phosphates, and dietary fibre. Foods like milk, eggs, and tea also inhibit iron absorption. Indian vegetarian diets often contain high levels of these inhibitors (e.g., phytates in bran, phosphates in egg yolk, tannin in tea, and oxalates in vegetables).

      "question": "Which statement is correct regarding the reference woman represents the average healthy woman's nutritional needs and is used as a standard for setting the RDA ?",
      "options": {
        "A": "Weight 55 kgs",
        "B": "Height 1.73 m",

        "D": "Age of 18-25 years"
      },
      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: A) Weight 55 kgs Explanation: The reference woman represents the average healthy woman's nutritional needs and is used as a standard for setting the Recommended Dietary Allowance (RDA) . This reference is crucial for determining the nutrient requirements of the general population. Weight 55 kgs : The reference woman is typically assumed to have a body weight of 55 kg (121 lbs). This value is used to determine the average energy and nutrient requirements. Height 1.73 m (Option B) : While height is a factor in determining nutritional needs, the reference woman is generally assumed to have a height of around 1.60 m (not 1.73 m). Works 10 hours/day (Option C) : The reference woman is not assumed to work for a specific number of hours each day. Nutritional requirements can vary depending on physical activity, but the reference is typically for a woman with moderate activity levels. Age of 18-25 years (Option D) : The reference woman is not specifically limited to this age range. Nutritional needs are assessed based on a range of factors, including age, but the reference woman is generally used as an average for adult women (not limited to a specific age group).

      "question": "What is the most relevant information that should be obtained from the medical history of a patient from Chhattisgarh who is experiencing gradual muscle weakness and spasms in the legs, and exhibits only motor impairment upon examination?",
      "options": {
        "A": "History of similar illness in the past",
        "B": "History of fever",
        "C": "History of vaccination",
        "D": "History of diet"
      },
      "correct_answer": "D",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: D) History of diet. Explanation: The patient is from Chhattisgarh , a region known for outbreaks of Lathyrism , a neurological disorder caused by the consumption of Lathyrus sativus (Khesari dal) . Lathyrism is characterized by gradual-onset spastic paraparesis (muscle weakness and spasms in the legs), with only motor impairment and no sensory loss. The toxin β -N-oxalyl-L- α , β -diaminopropionic acid ( β -ODAP) in Khesari dal causes upper motor neuron (UMN) damage , leading to progressive spastic paralysis . Features of Lathyrism: Feature Findings Cause Excessive consumption of Lathyrus sativus (Khesari dal) Region Endemic in Chhattisgarh, Madhya Pradesh, Bihar, Odisha Symptoms Gradual-onset spastic paraparesis , hyperreflexia Sensory Involvement Absent (pure motor disorder) Prevention Dietary restriction, government bans on Khesari dal History of similar illness in the past (Option A): While a history of similar illness may be relevant in some cases, this patient's symptoms are more likely due to a dietary issue rather than a recurrent illness. History of fever (Option B): Fever could indicate an infection or inflammation but isn't the primary concern given the gradual onset of symptoms . The absence of fever makes this less relevant in the current context. History of vaccination (Option C): While vaccination is important for preventing diseases like poliomyelitis , in this case, the gradual onset of muscle weakness and spasms suggests a nutritional or metabolic cause rather than a vaccine-preventable disease.

      "question": "Which of the following factors can contribute to the development of malnutrition?",
      "options": {
        "A": "Child rearing",
        "B": "Infectious diseases",
        "C": "Food habits",
        "D": "Socioeconomic factors"
      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: B) Infectious diseases Explanation: Infectious diseases significantly contribute to malnutrition by increasing metabolic demands, reducing appetite, impairing nutrient absorption, and causing nutrient loss. Common infections such as diarrhea, tuberculosis, parasitic infections, and respiratory infections lead to weight loss, muscle wasting, and stunting. Recurrent infections create a vicious cycle where malnutrition weakens immunity, leading to more infections. Role of Infectious Diseases in Malnutrition: Infection Effect on Nutrition Diarrheal diseases Causes fluid and nutrient loss , leading to dehydration and malabsorption. Tuberculosis (TB) Increases catabolism (muscle breakdown) , leading to weight loss. Parasitic infections (e.g., hookworm, giardiasis) Causes iron deficiency anemia, protein loss, and malabsorption . Measles Leads to vitamin A deficiency , impairing immune function. Child rearing (Option A): While child rearing practices can influence nutrition (e.g., breastfeeding practices, introduction of complementary foods), it does not directly cause malnutrition in the same way infections can. Poor child rearing practices may contribute, but they are not a primary factor. Food habits (Option C): Food habits certainly play a role in nutrition, but they alone do not directly cause malnutrition unless they are extreme (e.g., insufficient intake of essential nutrients). In general, food habits are more of a contributing factor rather than a primary cause. Socioeconomic factors (Option D): Socioeconomic factors, such as poverty, can significantly affect access to adequate food and healthcare, contributing to malnutrition. However, socioeconomic factors are broader and often contribute in conjunction with other factors like food habits and infectious diseases.

        "A": "Phosphatase test",
        "B": "Iodine test",
        "C": "Standard plate count",
        "D": "Methylene blue reduction test"
      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "of milk. It is a test used to detect the presence of starch in a substance. It involves adding iodine solution to the sample, and if starch is present, the solution will turn blue-black. Incorrect Choices: Phosphatase test (Option A): The phosphatase test is indeed related to the pasteurization of milk. Phosphatase is an enzyme naturally present in raw milk but is inactivated during the pasteurization process. By measuring the activity of phosphatase in milk, it can be determined if proper pasteurization has occurred. Therefore, this option is incorrect as the phosphatase test is directly related to pasteurization. Standard plate count (Option C): The standard plate count is also related to the pasteurization of milk. It is a test used to determine the total number of viable microorganisms present in milk. By assessing the microbial load, the effectiveness of pasteurization in reducing bacterial contamination can be evaluated. This option is incorrect as the standard plate count is directly associated with assessing the pasteurization process. Methylene blue reduction test (Option D): The methylene blue reduction test is used to assess the bacteriological quality of milk and the efficiency of pasteurization. It evaluates the reduction of methylene blue dye by the metabolic activity of microorganisms in milk. This test helps determine if pasteurization has effectively inhibited bacterial growth. Therefore, this option is incorrect as the methylene blue reduction test is directly related to pasteurization. Reference: Park’s Textbook of Preventive and Social Medicine, 27th Edition, Page 723",

        "C": "10% salt water",
        "D": "Water"
      },
      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer A - 20% salt water A 20% salt water solution creates a density that makes black seeds sink, while Bajra seeds stay afloat, making the separation easy. Ergotism: Ergot is a fungus (Claviceps purpurea) that infects food grains such as bajra, rye, sorghum, and wheat during their flowering stages. Consumption of ergot-infested grains can lead to ergotism , characterised by acute symptoms such as nausea, repeated vomiting, giddiness, and drowsiness lasting up to 24 to 48 hours . In chronic cases, ergotism may cause painful cramps in limbs and peripheral gangrene due to vasoconstriction of capillaries . Modern high-yielding varieties of bajra are more susceptible to ergot infestation. Infested grains can be removed in 20% salt water, hand-picking, or air floatation. The upper safe limit for ergot alkaloids in food material is 0.05 mg per 100 grams. Reference: Park’s Textbook of Preventive and Social Medicine, 27th edition, page 772",

      "explanation": "Severe underweight can result from chronic malnutrition because it reflects a long-term deficit in nutrient intake. Height/age < -2.5 SD : This indicates stunting. Stunting is a sign of chronic malnutrition, reflecting long-term inadequate nutrition and poor health conditions. Weight/height < -1.7 SD : This indicates wasting. Wasting is typically a sign of acute malnutrition, but in this context, it is less severe compared to the other measures. Given the severity of the indicators for weight/age and height/age, which are more pronounced, the primary issue appears to be chronic malnutrition. Incorrect Options: Option A - Acute malnutrition: Acute malnutrition is primarily indicated by significant wasting (weight/height < -2 SD). Although the child has wasting (weight/height < -1.7 SD), the more severe indicators are weight/age and height/age, pointing more towards a chronic issue rather than an acute one. Acute on chronic malnutrition would be considered if both stunting (chronic) and wasting (acute) were severely present. In this case, the degree of wasting (weight/height < -1.7 SD) is not as severe as the stunting and underweight indicators, which suggests that the primary issue is chronic. Option C - Acute on chronic malnutrition: Acute on chronic malnutrition would be considered if both stunting (chronic) and wasting (acute) were severely present. In this case, the degree of wasting (weight/height < -1.7 SD) is not as severe as the stunting and underweight indicators, which suggests that the primary issue is chronic. Option D - Severe malnutrition: Severe malnutrition is a general term and could refer to either acute or chronic malnutrition.

      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "common pasteurization method. Pasteurization is a heat treatment process used to eliminate or reduce the presence of harmful microorganisms in food and beverages while maintaining their quality. There are different pasteurization methods, but the high temperature and short time method (also known as HTST or flash pasteurization) is the most widely employed method today. Milk is rapidly heated to a temperature of about 72 degree Celsius, is held at that temperature for not less than 15 seconds, and is then rapidly cooled to 4 degree Celsius. This method can pasteurize very large quantities of milk per hour. Incorrect Options: Option A . Holder (VAT) method: The Holder method, also known as the vat pasteurization method, involves heating milk or other liquids to a specified temperature and holding it at that temperature for a fixed duration. While this method was historically used, it is not as common today as the HTST method. Option B . Ultra high temperature method: The ultra-high temperature (UHT) method involves heating food or beverages to a very high temperature, typically above 135 degrees Celsius (275 degrees Fahrenheit), for a very short period, usually a few seconds. UHT pasteurization is commonly used for products that need extended shelf life without refrigeration. While the UHT method is widely used for some products, such as long-life milk, it is not the most common method overall. Option D . Low temperature and long time method: The low temperature and long time (LTLT) method, also known as batch pasteurization, involves heating milk or other liquids at lower temperatures for a longer duration compared to the HTST method. This method is commonly used for certain dairy products, such as artisanal or specialty cheeses, where maintaining the flavor and texture is crucial. However, it is not the most commonly used method in general food and beverage processing.",

      "explanation": "value of protein. Serum albumin concentration is commonly used as an indicator of protein nutritional status and is often included in assessments of overall nutritional status. Here's why it is considered the best index for calculating the nutrient value of protein: Protein Transport and Function: Albumin is the most abundant protein in the blood and plays a crucial role in transporting nutrients, including amino acids, hormones, and fatty acids, throughout the body. It also contributes to maintaining oncotic pressure and regulating fluid balance. Monitoring serum albumin concentration provides insights into the body's protein status and its ability to maintain these essential functions. Long Half-Life: Serum albumin has a relatively long half-life of about 20 days. This means that changes in serum albumin concentration reflect more prolonged changes in protein intake and synthesis rather than short-term fluctuations. It allows for a more accurate assessment of the long-term protein nutritional status of an individual. Availability of Laboratory Tests: Measuring serum albumin concentration is a relatively straightforward and widely available laboratory test. It can be easily performed using routine blood tests, making it a practical and cost-effective measure for evaluating protein nutritional status. Incorrect Option: Option B . Arm-muscle circumference: Arm-muscle circumference is often used as an indicator of muscle mass and can be affected by factors other than protein intake, such as physical activity and body fat percentage. It does not directly measure protein nutritional status or provide information about protein synthesis or breakdown. Option C . Creatinine-height index: The creatinine-height index is used to estimate muscle mass and assess muscle wasting. It is primarily used in specific clinical settings, such as in patients with kidney disease, and is not a direct measure of protein nutritional status or the nutrient value of protein intake.

      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "type of anemia is characterized by red blood cells that are larger than normal (macrocytic) and have reduced hemoglobin content (hypochromic). Vitamin B12 is essential for the production of healthy red blood cells. It plays a key role in the synthesis of DNA and in the maturation of red blood cells in the bone marrow. Deficiency of vitamin B12 can result in ineffective DNA synthesis and impaired maturation of red blood cells, leading to the characteristic features of macrocytic hypochromic anemia. Incorrect Options Option A . Microcytic hypochromic anemia (choice A) is typically associated with iron deficiency anemia, where red blood cells are smaller and have reduced hemoglobin content. Option C . Normocytic normochromic anemia (choice C) refers to anemia with normal-sized red blood cells and normal hemoglobin content. It can be caused by various factors such as chronic diseases, kidney problems, and bone marrow disorders. Option D . None of the above is an incorrect answer as B is the correct answer Reference: .",

      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "the identification of clinical signs and symptoms associated with the deficiency. One of the early signs of Vitamin A deficiency is night blindness, which refers to the inability or difficulty to see in low light conditions or at night. Night blindness occurs due to the impaired functioning of the retina, which is responsible for vision in dim light. By asking individuals, particularly school children, about their ability to see in low light conditions or at night, healthcare providers or school health personnel can screen for the presence of night blindness. Children who report difficulties with night vision are likely to have an underlying Vitamin A deficiency. Incorrect Options Option A. Retinol: Retinol is a form of Vitamin A, but it is not a specific screening method for Vitamin A deficiency. Retinol levels can be measured in blood samples to assess overall Vitamin A status, but this is not typically used as a screening tool in a school setting. Option C. Carotene: Carotene, a precursor to Vitamin A, can be found in certain foods such as carrots, sweet potatoes, and leafy greens. However, assessing carotene levels is not a practical screening method for Vitamin A deficiency in a school setting. Option D. Bitot spots: Bitot spots are a clinical manifestation of Vitamin A deficiency and appear as foamy, white patches on the conjunctiva of the eye. While the presence of Bitot spots may indicate Vitamin A deficiency, their detection requires a close examination of the eyes, which may not be feasible in a school screening scenarioC Reference: .",

      "correct_answer": "D",
      "explanation": "WHO guidelines. A MAC measurement of 11.5 cms or less would indeed indicate severe malnutrition. Mid-upper arm circumference (MAC) is a commonly used anthropometric measurement to assess nutritional status, particularly for identifying severe malnutrition in children. MAC provides an estimate of muscle and fat stores in the upper arm and is an indicator of body composition and nutritional reserves. In severe malnutrition, the MAC measurement is typically below a certain cutoff point. The World Health Organization (WHO) defines a MAC of less than 11.5 cms as a criterion for severe acute malnutrition in children aged 6-59 months. Incorrect Options: Option A: 14.5 cms A MAC measurement of 14.5 cms would not be indicative of severe malnutrition. This value is within the normal range and does not suggest severe wasting or nutritional deficiency. Option B: 13.5 cms Similar to the previous choice, a MAC measurement of 13.5 cms would still fall within the normal range and would not indicate severe malnutrition. Option C: 12.5 cms MAC equal to or greater than 125 mm(12.5cms ) indicates No Acute Malnutrition Severe Acute Malnutrition (SAM): MAC less than 115 mm. Moderate Acute Malnutrition (MAM): MAC between 115 mm and 125 mm. Reference: 1)Notes, 2) Ref: Park’s textbook of preventive medicine, edition: 25",

Incorrect choices: Option a : A normal optic disc that shows no signs of damage or abnormalities is referred to as WHO grade 1A. The optic disc, which is located where the optic nerve enters and leaves the eye, is in charge of carrying visual data from the eye to the brain. A grade 1A finding denotes the absence of any signs of disease or damage to the optic disc, and the likelihood that the visual function is normal. Option c: Individuals with mild visual impairment are given the WHO grade 2A. In their better eye, people with 2A visual impairment have a visual acuity between 6/18 and 6/24 after correction (such as glasses or contact lenses), according to the WHO. Option d: The WHO classifies moderate visual impairment as grade 2B. It is indicated by a central visual field diameter of less than 20 degrees in the better eye, or by visual acuity in the better eye ranging from 6/18 to 6/60 (inclusive). As a result, while someone with a 2B visual impairment may be able to see some detail, their visual field is constrained, and they may find it difficult to perform tasks that call for fine visual discrimination or mobility.

      "explanation": "and other countries. When consumed in large quantities over time, the dal contains a neurotoxin called beta-N-oxalyl-L-alpha-beta diaminopropionic acid (BOAA), which can cause a neurological disorder called lathyrism. Vitamin C, also known as ascorbic acid, plays a role in lathyrism due to its potential protective effects against the toxic effects of β -ODAP. β -ODAP is known to induce oxidative stress and damage to neurons. Vitamin C is an antioxidant that can counteract oxidative stress by neutralizing harmful free radicals and protecting cells from damage. Incorrect choices Option a : Some evidence suggests that sodium bicarbonate may exacerbate the effects of Kesari dal toxicity. This is due to the fact that bicarbonate can increase ODAP absorption from the gastrointestinal tract and thus increase its toxicity. As a result, using sodium bicarbonate to treat Kesari dal toxicity is generally not advised. Option b: There is no evidence that vitamin A has any effect on Kesari dal toxicity or Lathyrism. However, adequate vitamin A intake is required for healthy vision, immune system function, and cell growth and differentiation. Option d : Kesari Dal toxicity is not treated with IV immunoglobulin because it is not a viral or immune-mediated condition. It is most commonly used to treat autoimmune and immune-mediated disorders, as well as some cases of primary immunodeficiency disorders. Reference: .",
