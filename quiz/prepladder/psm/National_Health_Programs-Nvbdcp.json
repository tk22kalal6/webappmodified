      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: A) Aims to completely eradicate malaria globally by 2025. Explanation: The enhanced malaria control project aims to eradicate malaria globally by 2030. Enhanced Malaria Control (EMC) Project: Refers to a comprehensive approach to combating malaria through various strategies and interventions. Initiated by National governments collaborating with international organisations (e.g., WHO, NGOs like Malaria Consortium) and donor agencies (e.g., Global Fund). Indian Scenario: The World Bank-aided Enhanced Malaria Control Project (EMCP) was implemented in the tribal areas of 100 high malaria burden districts of 8 states , viz., Andhra Pradesh, Chhattisgarh, Gujarat, Jharkhand, Madhya Pradesh, Maharashtra, Orissa and Rajasthan. The programme focuses on both rural and urban areas where malaria transmission occurs. Objectives and Goals: Reduce Malaria Transmission: This strategy focuses on both rural and urban areas where malaria transmission occurs by implementing effective vector control (e.g., bed nets and indoor spraying). Improve Case Management: Ensure prompt diagnosis and treatment. Enhance Surveillance and Monitoring: Strengthen systems to track cases. Community Engagement: Educate and involve communities in prevention and treatment. Achieve Sustainable Results: Work towards sustained reduction and, where possible, elimination of malaria.

      "question": "A 28-year-old traveller returning from a malaria-endemic region presents with high fever, chills, and sweating. A physician orders thick and thin blood smears as part of the diagnostic workup for malaria. What is the primary purpose of the thin smear in malaria diagnosis?",
      "options": {

        "D": "To measure the parasite load."
      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: B) To determine the species of malaria parasite. Explanation: The Jaswantsingh Bhattacharya (J.B.) stain is a modified Romanowsky stain used as an alternative to Giemsa stain for preparing thick and thin blood smears in malaria diagnosis. Thin Smear is used primarily to identify and differentiate the species of Plasmodium. It allows for better visualisation of the malaria parasites and their stages, aiding in accurate species identification. This information is crucial for appropriate treatment and management of the patient. Thick smear used for Detection of Parasites: Thick smear microscopy is particularly useful for detecting the presence of malaria parasites in a sample. Thick smears involve a higher concentration of blood cells and are more sensitive in detecting low levels of parasitemia. Acridine orange staining for malaria detection JSB stain is used for preparation of thick and thin smears Quantification of Parasites: Thick smears allow for the estimation of the parasite load or density, which is crucial in determining the severity of the infection and monitoring the response to treatment. QBC (Quantitative Buffy Coat): The technique is a rapid, sensitive method for diagnosing malaria. It utilizes fluorescent dyes like acridine orange to stain parasite DNA in blood samples, which are then examined under an epifluorescent microscope. While it enhances sensitivity for P. falciparum , it is less effective for non-falciparum species and suffers from reduced specificity due to leukocyte DNA staining. The method is highly sensitive at low parasitemia but requires specialized, costly equipment and doesn't provide species identification or parasite quantification.

      "explanation": "Correct Answer: C) Detects the pLDH enzyme produced by live parasites Explanation: The pLDH (Plasmodium Lactate Dehydrogenase) test is used as the Optimal test among other Rapid Diagnostics Test (RDT) available for several reasons: Detection of all Plasmodium species and the ability to differentiate between species like P. falciparum and P. vivax. Indicator of Active Infection. Rapid and efficient diagnosis; provides results within 15-20 minutes. Non-Invasiveness and Ease of Use. Cost-Effectiveness.

Identifies active infections 2.
