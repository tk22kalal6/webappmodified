Explanation: Immediate High Dose: The initial high dose of 200,000 IU is necessary to rapidly replenish vitamin A levels in the body, addressing the acute deficiency and preventing further deterioration. Follow-Up Dose: Repeating the dose the next day ensures that the body receives a sufficient amount of vitamin A to start correcting the deficiency effectively. 2 Doses are mostly sufficient to reverse the ocular signs of Vitamin A deficiency. Third Dose if Needed: A third dose after 2-4 weeks may be required if clinical signs persist, ensuring that the deficiency is fully corrected.

      "explanation": "(IMR) is 28 per 1000 live births, as reported by the Sample Registration System (SRS). Infant mortality rate (IMR) is expressed as the number of deaths of infants (aged 0-1 year) per 1000 live births in a given year. Infant mortality rate (IMR) = (No. of deaths of children (infant) 0-1 year of life / live births) x 1000) Causes: The most common cause is low birth weight/prematurity according to the latest update Other causes include asphyxia, ARIs, diarrhea, congenital anomalies, cord infection, birth trauma, and others. Most infant deaths occur within the first month of life, with a significant proportion (54.6%) occurring during the first week. The risk of death is highest within the first 24-48 hours after birth. IMR reflects the effectiveness of maternal and child health (MCH) services and overall healthcare infrastructure in preventing infant deaths.

      "explanation": "trimester and has complaints of polydipsia and polyuria . She also has a history of giving birth to an overweight baby ( Macrosomia ). This suggests the possibility of her having Gestational Diabetes Mellitus (GDM). The OGCT is commonly used as a screening test for GDM. Procedure: The patient is given a 50g oral glucose solution to drink. One hour after drinking the glucose solution, blood is drawn to measure blood glucose levels. Interpretation: A 140 mg/dL or higher blood glucose level is considered abnormal and warrants further testing with an OGTT. The OGTT (Oral Glucose Tolerance Test) is a diagnostic test for GDM. OGTT is performed in the 1st antenatal visit and then repeated again at 24-28 weeks POG Procedure: A fasting blood sample is drawn to measure the baseline glucose level. The patient drinks a 75g oral glucose solution. Blood samples are drawn one hour and two hours after drinking the glucose solution. Interpretation: According to DIPSI guidelines, the diagnosis of GDM is made if any of the following plasma glucose values are met or exceeded: Fasting: 92 mg/dL 1 hour: 180 mg/dL 2 hours: 153 mg/dL This 2-step approach is widely recommended and provides a reliable method for diagnosing GDM. RBS, FBS, and HbA1c tests ( Options 1 , 2, & 4) are less specific and commonly used for ruling out overt diabetes mellitus and diagnosing GDM. Reference: Screening & diagnosis of GDM- NIH",
