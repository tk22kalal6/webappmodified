On examination, she is found to have significant scarring of the inner eyelids, leading to an inward turning of the eyelashes that scrapes against the cornea. What is the most likely cause of her preventable blindness?",

      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: C) Trachoma Explanation: Based on the above scenario, the patient is most likely diagnosed with Trachoma. Trachoma: A Chronic infection caused by Chlamydia trachomatis most commonly by serovars A, B, Ba, C leading to eyelid scarring, trichiasis, and corneal opacities. M/C cause of preventable blindness in adults is Trachoma Trachoma - WHO classification: TF - Trachomatous inflammation - follicular TI - Trachomatous inflammation - intense TS - Trachomatous scarring TT - Trachomatous trichiasis CO - Corneal Opacity SAFE Strategy The WHO's GET 2020 program (Global Elimination of Trachoma by 2020), has adopted the SAFE strategy for prophylaxis against trachoma infection and prevention of blindness, which includes: S: Surgery (Tertiary prevention) A: Antibiotic use (Secondary prevention) F: Facial hygiene (Primary prevention), and E: Environmental changes (Primordial prevention). Option A- Cataract : Clouding of the lens; age-related, unrelated to eyelash or corneal changes. Option B- Glaucoma : Damage to the optic nerve, usually associated with high intraocular pressure, leading to vision loss without eyelash or corneal changes. It is most common. M/C causes of curable blindness are cataract, refractive errors, and glaucoma. Option D- Vitamin A Deficiency: Can lead to night blindness and corneal scarring; not associated with trichiasis or repeated infections as in trachoma. Vit. A deficiency is the most common cause of preventable blindness in children.
