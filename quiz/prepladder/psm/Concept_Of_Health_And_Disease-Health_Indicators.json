      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: C) Expectation of life Explanation: Mortality indicators: Crude death rate CDR = (Total no. or deaths in a community/ MYP (Mid-year population) in the same area) x 100 The mid-year population is taken on 1st July Limitation: It does not consider the age and sex of the population Age-specific death rate (Option A) ASDR = (Total no. of deaths in a particular age group (eg. 20-24yrs) a given area in a year/ MYP of the age group in the same area and year) x 1000 Expectation of life (Option C) Life expectancy at birth: A positive mortality indicator· Average no. of years a newborn is expected to live, considering the current age-specific mortality rates in a community. Important component to calculate the Human Development Index (HDI). Life expectancy at one year is PQLI. In 2021, life expectancy in India is 69.7 years . Infant mortality rate IMR = (Total number of deaths (0-1-year-old) in a given year / Total number of live births in the same year) x 1000. It is a health status indicator. Under-five mortality rate U5MR = (Total number of deaths (0-5 years old) in a given year /Total number of live births in one year) x 1000 Maternal Mortality Rate Maternal Mortality Rate (MMR) = (Total no. of maternal deaths/women in the reproductive age group [15-49 years]) x 100,000 Maternal Mortality Ratio (MMR) Maternal Mortality Ratio (MMR) = (Total no. of maternal deaths/Live Births) x 100,000 Adult mortality rate Probability of dying between 15 to 60 years of life Year of potential life lost (Option D) Premature death measurement. If life expectancy is 75 years, and death happens at age 30, then 45 years of potential life is lost Proportional mortality rate (Option B) The simplest measure of the burden of disease (Total deaths due to disease 'x'/ Total deaths in a community) I x 100 Case fatality rate CFR = (Deaths due to diseases ‘z’ / total no of cases of disease ‘z’) x 100 Reference: Park’sTextbook of Preventive and Social Medicine 27th ed pg 26, 64, 635 Reference: Park Textbook of Preventive Medicine, 27th Edition, Page 26, 64, 635",

      "question": "Which of the following is true regarding maternal mortality rate?",
      "options": {
        "A": "The reproductive age group is taken between ages 15 to 50 years",
        "B": "Pregnancy-related deaths are counted up to 6 weeks postpartum",
        "C": "Most common direct cause of maternal mortality is anemia",
        "D": "Most common indirect cause of maternal mortality is hemorrhage( Post-partum hemorrhage)."
      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: B) Pregnancy-related deaths are counted up to 6 weeks postpartum Explanation: Pregnancy-related deaths are counted up to 6 weeks (OR) 42 days postpartum. The reproductive age group is taken from 15 to 49 years, not 50 years (Option A). Direct obstetric deaths are deaths due to obstetric complications of the pregnant state((Pregnancy, labor, and puerperium). Deaths due to obstetric hemorrhage or hypertensive disorders of pregnancy come under direct causes. The most common direct cause of maternal mortality is hemorrhage ( Post-partum hemorrhage). (Option C) Indirect obstetric deaths are those resulting from previous existing diseases or diseases during pregnancy, aggravated by the physiological changes of pregnancy, and not due to direct obstetric deaths. Causes include anemia and existing cardiac or renal causes. The most common indirect cause of maternal mortality is anemia (Option D). MMR Maternal Mortality Rate (MMR) = (Total no. of maternal deaths/women in the reproductive age group [15-49 years]) x 100,000 Maternal Mortality Ratio (MMR) = (Total no. of maternal deaths/Live Births) x 100,000 Indicator of quality of healthcare delivery services Maternal deaths: Deaths during antenatal period/ delivery /postnatal period (up to 6 weeks post-delivery), excluding accidental causes.

      "question": "Which of the following statements best describes DALY?",
      "options": {
        "A": "It measures years lost to disability alone",
        "B": "It measures years lost to death alone",
        "C": "It measures years lost to disability and death",
        "D": "None of the above"
      },
      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: C) It measures years lost to disability and death Explanation: DALY or Disability-adjusted Life Years measures years of life lost to disability, and premature death both. Disability Indicators: Quality-adjusted Life Years (QALY) Quality and quantity of life lived. Assesses number of years of life added due to the intervention and hence the benefit and value for money of the intervention QALY - 1 year of life lived in perfect health Positive indicator of the cost-effectiveness of an intervention. Scored between 0 (death) and 1 (perfect health). Disability-adjusted Life Years (DALY) DALY= Years of life lost to premature death + years lived with disability 1 DALY: 1 year of healthy life lost It is a measure of the burden of disease and the effectiveness of intervention Year of life lost (YLL): Calculated from the number of deaths at each age multiplied by the expected remaining years of life according to a global standard life expectancy. Years lost to disability (YLD): Where the number of incident cases due to injury and illness is multiplied by the average duration of the disease and a weighting factor reflecting the severity of the disease on a scale from 0 (perfect health) to 1 (dead). DALY = YLL + YLD Health Adjusted Life Expectancy (HALE) The average number of years a newborn is expected to live in full health considering the current age-specific mortality rate. Healthy Life Expectancy HALE = Life Expectancy at birth + adjustment of time spent in poor health HALE = LE-DALY Life Expectancy Average no. of years a newborn is expected to live, considering the current age-specific mortality rate.

      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Correct answer: C) Bed occupancy rates Explanation: Bed occupancy rate is a health care utilization indicator, not a health care delivery indicator.
