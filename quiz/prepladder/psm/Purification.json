      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "water. Correct Answer: C) Shallow wells are more likely to get contaminated and yield limited quantities of water. Explanation: Shallow wells tap water from above the first impervious layer, making them more susceptible to contamination and often yield limited quantities of water. In contrast, deep wells tap water from underneath the first impervious layer, providing purer water in sufficient quantities and a constant supply, even during summer. Porous layer: made of sand, gravel and allows water to pass through it. Impervious layer: made of clay, mud and does not allow water to pass through it. Shallow well vs Deep well: Shallow well Deep well Taps water from above first impervious layer Taps water from underneath the first impervious layer Moderately hard water Very hard water More likely to get contaminated Not liable for contamination yielding purer water Yield limited quantities of water Yield sufficient quantities of water providing source of constant supply Easy and cheaper to construct Difficult and expensive to construct",

      "explanation": "Correct Answer B) 35 grams Explanation 1. Calculate the volume of the well : Volume of a cylinder = π × radius² × height (or) V= π x (diameter/2)² x height Radius = Diameter / 2 = 1.5 meters / 2 = 0.75 meters Height = Depth of the well = 10 meters Volume = π × (0.75 meters)² × 10 meters → Volume ≈ 3.14 × 0.5625 × 10 → Volume ≈ 17.67 cubic meters 2. Calculate the amount of bleaching powder needed : Bleaching powder required = Volume of the well × Amount of bleaching powder per cubic meter ⇒ 17.67 cubic meters × 2 grams per cubic meter Bleaching powder required ≈ 35.33 grams Rounding off, the required amount of bleaching powder is approximately 35 grams.

      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "re-treatment every 4-6 hours. Correct Answer: B) Boiling is not preferred as a mode of water purification because it requires re-treatment every 4-6 hours. Explanation: This statement is true because boiling water is Costly as it consumes a lot of gas. It requires boiling water every 4-6 hours (re-treatment). Therefore it has no residual activity. Hence it is not the preferred method of purification. Boiling water is costly and provides no residual activity, hence it is not preferred over chlorine. However, it is still the best method available for purification. (Option A) Chlorine is a more effective mode of water purification than boiling due to (Option C): It has high residual activity and does not require frequent re-treatment of water. This residual activity is also known as Free chlorine. This makes it very cost-effective as well. The most commonly used form of chlorination is bleaching powder 100g of bleaching powder releases 33 grams of chlorine. However, it is the 2nd best method available for water purification on a small scale. For water to be chlorinated, water should be free from turbidity as turbidity impedes efficient chlorination.

Explanation: This is true because: Disinfecting property of chlorine - 90% is due to HOCl (Hypochlorous acid) and 10% due to OCl- (Hypochlorite ion). Hence, the Major disinfecting property of chlorine is due to Hypochlorous acid. The major disinfecting property is due to the HOCl (90%) and not OCl- (10%). (Option A) HCl gets neutralized by the alkalinity of water and has no role to play in the disinfection. (Option B) Boiling is considered to be the best method of water purification as it kills spores, ova, cyclops, and other resistant microorganisms. Also, to kill Poliovirus/Cyclops, the dose of chlorine needs to be increased, leading to an alteration in the taste and smell of water. (Option C)",

Correct Answer: D) The OT test can detect free chlorine but not combined chlorine, while the OTA test can detect both free and combined chlorine separately and is not affected by interfering substances. detect free chlorine but does not separately measure combined chlorine. Combined chlorine ( i.e chlorine demand of water measured by Horrocks apparatus) + free/ residual chlorine( 0.5 mg/dl for drinking water) = total amount of chlorine in the water. Combined chlorine by OT test is measured indirectly as: Total chlorine - free chlorine = combined chlorine The OTA (Ortho Toluidine Arsenite) test, however, can detect both free and combined chlorine separately and is not influenced by substances such as nitrates, iron, and manganese, making it a more robust and precise method for water chlorination testing. The OT test can detect free chlorine but does not combine chlorine separately. On the other hand, the OTA test can detect both free and combined chlorine separately, making it superior to the OT test in this regard. (Option A) The statement is only partially correct. Breakpoint chlorination is the point at which the chlorine demand of water is met and NOT exceeded. (Option B) When the chlorine demand of water is met, any additional chlorine added remains as free or residual chlorine, which ensures continuous disinfection. The OTA test is designed to detect both free and combined chlorine separately. Additionally, it is not affected by interfering substances like nitrates, iron, and manganese, making it more reliable in various conditions compared to the OT test.
