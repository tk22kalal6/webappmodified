      "explanation": "Correct Answer: B) Wood's lamp examamination Explanation: Wood's lamp examination is the initial diagnostic tool used to confirm Erythrasma . It is a superficial skin infection caused by Corynebacterium minutissimum. Risk factors include diabetes mellitus, obesity, immunocompromised state, hyperhidrosis, and older adults. It usually presents as asymptomatic lesions in the following areas: Interdigital: Scaling, fissuring plaques, maceration. Intertriginous (between skin folds): Hyperpigmented patches, mild scaling, wrinkling. Genital/perianal: Pruritis ani Interdigital erythrasma commonly occurs with dermatophyte or candidal infections. Wood's lamp examination shows coral-red fluorescence from coproporphyrin III produced by Corynebacterium minutissimum. Treatment: First line: Topical antibacterials (Fusidic acid, Clarithromycin) or topical antifungal (Miconazole) Second line: Photodynamic therapy using porphyrin Microscopy with KOH (Option A): It is commonly used to diagnose fungal infections like dermatophyte or candidal infection. ( Images : Left - Candidal infection; Right - Tinea versicolor) Dermatoscope Examination (Option C) : This tool is primarily used for evaluating pigmented skin lesions. It is not diagnostic for erythrasma but is useful for identifying melanomas and other skin cancers and tumours. Skin Culture (Option D) : Small shiny, whitish-grey colonies with coral-red fluorescence would be observed in a culture. However, a Wood's lamp examination can be performed in the clinic, offering a more immediate diagnosis and treatment.",

      "explanation": "Correct Answer: D) Pseudomonas aeruginosa Based on the given clinical scenario, the patient has pseudomonas folliculitis or hot tub folliculitis, an infection of the skin commonly associated with swimming pool and hot tub use. Risk factors include changes to cutaneous flora, female gender, length of exposure, and skin trauma. Within 48 hours of exposure, it presents as pruritic papules and papulopustules ranging from two to ten millimetres in diameter. It most often presents on the flanks, axillae, buttocks, and ears. Management can vary with the severity of the infection. In most cases, lesions are self-limited and resolve without management in one to two weeks. In severe cases, antipseudomonal agents like ticarcillin and piperacillin can be given. Staphylococcus aureus (Option A): Folliculitis caused by staph aureus is also known as Bockhart impetigo. The classical presentation of crops of domed yellow pustules involving hair follicles. Usually heals spontaneously but sometimes becomes chronic. Streptococcus pyogenes (Option B): Streptococcus pyogenes causes infections in the Superficial keratin layer (impetigo), The superficial dermis (erysipelas), The deep dermis & subcutaneous tissue (cellulitis), The fascia (necrotizing fasciitis), or Muscle (myositis and myonecrosis). Cellulitis: Corynebacterium minutissimum (Option C): Erythrasma is a bacterial infection of the skin typically caused by Corynebacterium minutissimum. This pathogen infects the stratum corneum in warm and wet areas of the skin. Most commonly, the axillary, inguinal, and interdigital regions are affected.",

      "explanation": "Correct Answer: D) All the above Explanation: The given clinical scenario and the image suggest the diagnosis of Green nail syndrome caused by Pseudomonas aeroginosa (Gram-negative bacilli). Skin infections caused by Pseudomonas aeruginosa can result from either direct contact or as secondary seeding from bloodstream infections. These infections include, Green nail syndrome Toe web infection Hot tub folliculitis Malignant external otitis Ecthyma gangrenosum P. aeruginosa subcutaneous nodules Necrotizing skin and soft tissue infections Burn wound infections Infection Description Green nail syndrome It is characterised by onycholysis and greenish discolouration of the nail bed. The green colour is due to pyocyanin, a green pigment produced by bacteria. Ecthyma gangrenosum (Option A) It is classically associated with P. aeruginosa sepsis and bacteremia in immunocompromised patients. It typically presents as painful, erythematous papules that progress to necrotic ulcers with surrounding erythema. The lesions can rapidly evolve into deep ulcers with black eschars. Hot tub folliculitis/ Pseudomonas folliculitis (Option B) Caused by Pseudomonas aeruginosa, which thrives in warm, moist environments like hot tubs and swimming pools with inadequate chlorine levels. It presents as itchy, red monomorphic papules or pustules around the hair follicles of the trunk. Malignant external otitis (Option C) Typically affects immunocompromised individuals. Symptoms include severe ear pain, purulent discharge, and potential cranial nerve involvement. Toe web infection/ Tropical immersion foot It presents as sharply demarcated",

        "A": "Staphylococcal scalded skin syndrome",
        "B": "Stevens-Johnson syndrome",
        "C": "Toxic epidermal necrolysis",
        "D": "Epidermolysis bullosa"
      },
      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: A) Staphylococcal scalded skin syndrome Explanation: The presence of a positive Nikolsky sign and the characteristic clinical features of severe blistering skin condition, suggests the diagnosis of Staphylococcal Scalded Skin Syndrome (SSSS). In this condition, exfoliative toxin 1 produced by Staphylococcus aureus binds to Desmoglein-1, leading to a subcorneal (intraepidermal) split. Clinical features: Macular erythema and skin pain that progresses to flaccid bullae Thick perioral crusting gives a ‘ dry oatmeal appearance ’ A positive Nikolsky sign is seen The mucous membrane is not involved Constitutional symptoms Diagnosis: Clinical presentation and examination are adequate for diagnosis Biopsy is indicated when the diagnosis is suspicious. A frozen section of the sloughed epidermis (skin biopsy) can confirm SSSS by revealing intraepidermal separation caused by exfoliative toxins. Treatment: Immediate hospital admission, intravenous antibiotic therapy, and the initiation of supportive measures. IIIIIII Stevens-Johnson syndrome (Option B): This condition typically involves mucosal lesions and often follows recent drug exposure, which is not the case here. Toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN) (Option C): TEN usually involves more extensive skin detachment and mucosal involvement, along with a more severe, widespread erythema. Epidermolysis bullosa (Option D): This is a genetic condition that",
