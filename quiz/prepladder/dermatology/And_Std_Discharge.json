      "explanation": "Correct Answer: C) Vaginal Candidiasis Explanation: Vaginal candidiasis, (yeast infection/ vaginal thrush) is caused by overgrowth of the fungus Candida albicans . Women with diabetes are at higher risk of developing yeast infections due to elevated blood sugar levels, which provide a favourable environment for yeast growth. The symptoms typically include vaginal itching, thick, white, curd-like discharge , and sometimes redness and swelling of the vulva. The absence of inflammation or lesions on examination further supports the diagnosis of vaginal candidiasis Unlike other vaginal discharges, Vaginal pH is usually acidic . Treatment: Topical azole antifungals: Clotrimazole, miconazole, econazole, or tioconazole creams or suppositories Oral azole antifungals: Fluconazole is an effective oral antifungal medication that may be prescribed as a single-dose regimen (150 mg) or as multiple doses depending on the severity of the infection. Bacterial vaginosis (BV) (Option A): It is characterized by a thin, greyish-white discharge with a characteristic fishy odour, known as \"whiff test\" positivity.

      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: A) Azithromycin Explanation: The clinical presentation and absence of bacteria on Gram stain suggest Chlamydia trachomatis as the likely cause of non-gonococcal cervicitis . The first-line treatment is a single dose of Azithromycin (1g orally). The diagnosis of NGU/NGC requires the exclusion of gonorrheal infection. This can be achieved with a gram stain that lacks gram-negative diplococci or by any negative gonorrhea test (culture, nucleic acid testing, among others). Chlamydia trachomatis serovars D-K are the most common cause of non-gonococcal urethritis. In females, it can cause various manifestations such as: Mucopurulent cervicitis ( most common ). It may progress to endometritis, salpingitis (fallopian tube), pelvic inflammatory disease, and finally pelvic peritonitis. Perihepatitis ( Fitz–Hugh–Curtis syndrome ). First-line management involves a single oral dose of azithromycin 1g stat. It is preferred due to its greater effectiveness and lower cost . The table below shows the management of uncomplicated chlamydial infections: Non-pregnant First line: Azithromycin 1g single dose Second line: Doxycycline 100mg BD x 7 days Third line: Ofloxacin 200-300mg BD x 7 days Pregnancy First line: Azithromycin 1g oral single dose Second line: Amoxicillin 500mg TDS x 7 days Ceftriaxone (Option B) is used for the treatment of gonococcal infections. Fluconazole (Option C) is used for the treatment of vaginal candidiasis. Doxycycline (Option D) is also highly effective for treating uncomplicated chlamydial infections. It is used when azithromycin is not available or there is a history of allergies. The recommended dose is 100 mg BD x 7 days.

Chlamydial pelvic inflammatory disease often presents asymptomatically but can cause symptoms such as lower abdominal pain, dyspareunia, and cervical motion tenderness. These symptoms, along with the patient's reported inability to conceive despite actively trying for the past 18 months, raise suspicion for chlamydial pelvic inflammatory disease (PID), which can lead to fallopian tube damage and subsequent infertility .

      "explanation": "Correct Answer: D) IM Ceftriaxone Explanation: Given the symptoms and risk factors, the most likely diagnosis is gonorrhoea. IM ceftriaxone, a third-generation cephalosporin antibiotic, is the recommended treatment. Ceftriaxone is typically given as a single dose, often combined with azithromycin to cover potential co-infection with Chlamydia trachomatis. In case of chlamydia the urethral discharge is mucoid/mucopurulent. Treatment regimens in Neisseria infection: Treatment Regimen Dosage/Duration Uncomplicated Gonorrhea Ceftriaxone 250 mg IM (intramuscular) + Azithromycin 1 g orally Single dose OR Doxycycline 100 mg orally twice daily, Erythromycin 500mg orally QDS daily For 7 days Note: Azithromycin is preferred if chlamydia coinfection is suspected.

Gram stain showing Neisseria gonorrhoeae Neisseria Gonorrhoea: Characteristic Description Bacterium Gram-negative diplococcus Clinical Presentation Genital discharge (purulent), dysuria, pelvic pain, rectal symptoms Complications Pelvic inflammatory disease (PID), epididymitis, prostatitis, disseminated gonococcal infection (DGI) Transmission Primarily through sexual contact (vaginal, anal, oral) with an infected individual Risk Factors Unprotected sex, multiple sexual partners, history of gonorrhoea Diagnosis In males, by gram stain(gram negative intracellular diplococci) and culture and in females by culture. Multiplex PCR Treatment SOD cefixime 400mg or intramuscular ceftriaxone 125/250mg as SD Bacterial vaginosis (Option A) is characterized by a thin, greyish-white vaginal discharge with a fishy odour, but it does not present with purulent discharge or intracellular gram-negative diplococci on Gram stain. Candidiasis ( Option B) is a fungal infection that causes vaginal itching and thick, white, cottage cheese-like discharge. Trichomoniasis ( Option C) is caused by the protozoan parasite Trichomonas vaginalis and typically presents with frothy, yellow-green, malodorous discharge.",

      "explanation": "Correct Answer: D) Hutchinson’s Triad Hutchinson’s Triad is a feature of the late-onset congenital syphilis. Congenital syphilis occurs when a pregnant woman with untreated syphilis passes the infection to her fetus during pregnancy. The bacterium Treponema pallidum can affect various organ systems in the newborn. The lesions in Congenital syphilis can be classified as Early onset (within 2 years after birth) and Late onset (after 2 years of birth). Lesions in Early Onset Congenital Syphilis: (Options A, B, C ruled out) Vesiculo Bullous rash - Over palms & soles (aka SYPHILITIC PEMPHIGUS) Inflammation of oral and nasal mucosa Continuous discharge from the nose is called snuffles.

The patient also has white patches in his mouth and a few small, red papules on his genitals. What is the most likely diagnosis?",

      "correct_answer": "D",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: D) Secondary Syphilis Explanation: The most likely diagnosis for this patient's presentation is secondary syphilis. Secondary syphilis occurs a few weeks to months after the initial infection (primary syphilis) and is characterized by a variety of symptoms, including a diffuse maculopapular rash involving the palms and soles. Other common features of secondary syphilis include fever, sore throat, and mucous membrane involvement (such as white patches in the mouth).
