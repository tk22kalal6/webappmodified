      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: B) Dermatomyositis Explanation: The given image shows a heliotrope rash, which is a characteristic feature of Dermatomyositis. Clinical Features of Dermatomyositis Weakness : Symmetric, proximal greater than distal. Rash : Characteristic rashes include: Heliotrope rash: Erythematous eyelid discolouration with periorbital edema. Gottron sign: Erythematous rash over extensor surfaces (knuckles, elbows, knees, ankles). Gottron papules: Raised erythematous rash over knuckles. V-sign: Rash on sun-exposed anterior neck and chest. Shawl sign: Rash over the back of the neck and shoulders. Nail bed telangiectasias: Dilated capillaries at nail beds. Subcutaneous calcium deposits. Weakness and rash can appear together or be separated by months. Some patients may present with only a rash (amyopathic DM), while others may show mainly weakness. Additional Symptoms: Myalgias, arthralgias, dysphagia, and dysarthria. Skin symptoms significantly affect overall life quality; pruritus can be debilitating. Pulmonary Issues: Dyspnea from ventilatory muscle weakness or intrinsic lung problems (interstitial lung disease, bronchopneumonia, alveolitis). Malignancy Risk: Higher risk (~15%) in adult-onset cases within the first 2–3 years. Heliotrope rash Gottron’s Papules Shawl sign V Sign Polymyositis (Option A): Muscle involvement similar to dermatomyositis but lacks skin manifestations. Inclusion body myositis (Option C): Does not present with a heliotrope rash. The feature distinguishing inclusion body myosistis from dermatomyositis and polymyositis is the lack of responsiveness to immunosuppressive treatment. Discoid lupus erythematosus (Option D): Carpet track or Tin tack sign, also called Cat's tongue is characteristic of DLE.",

      "explanation": "elbows, and knees . They are characteristic of juvenile dermatomyositis (JDM) , an autoimmune inflammatory myopathy. The clinical triad includes proximal muscle weakness, heliotrope rash (violaceous rash on eyelids), and Gottron’s papules . Muscle biopsy typically shows perivascular and perimysial inflammation with CD4+ T-cell infiltration .

Juvenile Dermatomyositis (JDM) is an autoimmune inflammatory myopathy affecting children.

      "options": {
        "A": "Photosensitive skin rash",
        "B": "Nail bed capillary changes",
        "C": "Gottron’s papules",
        "D": "Malar rash"
      },
      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: C) Gottron’s papules Explanation: Gottron’s papules are the most distinctive and characteristic feature of juvenile dermatomyositis (JDM) . They appear as violaceous, scaly papules symmetrically distributed over bony prominences , especially the knuckles, elbows, and knees . This is a hallmark finding in both juvenile and adult dermatomyositis and helps distinguish it from other connective tissue diseases. JDM is a rare autoimmune inflammatory myopathy affecting children, characterised by proximal muscle weakness and distinctive skin rashes . Clinical Features: Muscle involvement: Symmetrical proximal muscle weakness (difficulty climbing stairs, rising from a chair). Gower’s sign may be positive in severe cases. Cutaneous manifestations: Gottron’s papules (violaceous papules over knuckles, elbows, knees). Heliotrope rash (violaceous discolouration around eyelids). Nailfold capillary abnormalities (dilated capillary loops, dropout). Photosensitivity and facial erythema . Systemic involvement: Dysphagia, interstitial lung disease, calcinosis cutis (in chronic cases). Diagnosis: Raised muscle enzymes: CK, aldolase. MRI (muscle oedema) , EMG (myopathic changes). Muscle biopsy: Perifascicular atrophy, inflammatory infiltrates. ANA, anti-Mi-2, anti-MDA5 antibodies (useful in subtypes). Management: First-line: Corticosteroids (prednisolone) with methotrexate or azathioprine . IVIG, rituximab in refractory cases. Physiotherapy to prevent contractures. Photosensitive skin rash (Option A) is incorrect because while photosensitivity is common in JDM, it is not specific and can be seen in other autoimmune conditions like lupus erythematosus . Nail bed capillary changes (Option B) is incorrect because abnormal nailfold capillaries (dilated capillary loops, dropout) occur in JDM but are not as distinctive as Gottron’s papules. They are also seen in systemic sclerosis . Malar rash (Option D) is incorrect because a malar rash is more characteristic of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) , not JDM. Although JDM can have facial erythema , it does not spare the nasolabial folds , unlike the butterfly rash in lupus. Reference: Rook’s Textbook of Dermatology. 9th ed; 2016. p. 53.2-53.10",

      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: A) SLE Explanation: A 25-year-old female with: Fever Oral ulcers Erythematous facial lesions These features are classic for Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE) , especially when the facial rash involves the malar (butterfly) region — the cheeks and bridge of the nose — sparing the nasolabial folds. Feature Description Demographics Young females (childbearing age) Fever Common systemic symptom Oral ulcers Typically painless Malar rash Butterfly-shaped rash over cheeks and nose Photosensitivity Rash worsens with sun exposure Other features Arthritis, serositis, renal involvement, ANA/anti-dsDNA positivity Dermatomyositis (Option B): Presents with heliotrope rash (purple discoloration around eyes), Gottron’s papules , and proximal muscle weakness — not prominent in this case. Melasma (Option C): Brownish hyperpigmented macules over sun-exposed areas, especially face; no fever or oral ulcers . Rosacea (Option D): Facial erythema, telangiectasias, flushing, and pustules; typically in older adults and not associated with systemic symptoms like fever or ulcers.

      "question": "A patient presents with multiple nodulocystic lesions on the face. Which among the following is the drug of choice in this condition ?",
      "options": {
        "A": "Steroids",
        "B": "Isotretinoin",
        "C": "Erythromycin",
        "D": "Tetracycline"
      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "of choice for this condition is Isotretinoin. This condition is known as severe or nodulocystic acne, and Isotretinoin is considered the most effective treatment option for this type of acne. Isotretinoin is a retinoid medication that is derived from vitamin A. It works by reducing the size and activity of the sebaceous glands, which are responsible for producing excess oil that contributes to the development of acne. Isotretinoin also has anti-inflammatory properties, helping to reduce inflammation associated with nodulocystic acne Incorrect options: Option A) Steroids: Steroids, such as corticosteroids, are not the first-line treatment for nodulocystic acne. While they can help reduce inflammation, they are not typically used as the primary treatment for this condition. Steroids may be used in certain cases when there is a need to rapidly reduce inflammation, but they are not the preferred long-term treatment option. Option C) Erythromycin: Erythromycin is an antibiotic that can be used to treat acne, particularly in cases of mild to moderate acne. However, it is not the drug of choice for nodulocystic acne. Erythromycin is more commonly used as part of combination therapy or in cases where there is a bacterial component contributing to acne. Option D) Tetracycline: Tetracycline is another antibiotic that can be used in the treatment of acne, including moderate to severe forms. However, it is not the drug of choice for nodulocystic acne. Tetracycline and other oral antibiotics may be used as adjunctive therapy in combination with other treatments, but they are not typically relied upon as the sole treatment for nodulocystic acne.
