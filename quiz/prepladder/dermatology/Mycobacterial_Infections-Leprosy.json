        "D": "It may be used to classify patients"
      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Correct answer: B) It is a diagnostic test Explanation: The Lepromin Test or Mitsuda Test (Option C) is not primarily used as a diagnostic test for leprosy. Instead, it assesses the cell-mediated immune response to Mycobacterium leprae. It helps classify leprosy patients into the Ridley-Jopling classification system and evaluate their immune status (Option D) Procedure: Involves injecting a standardized preparation of heat-killed M. leprae antigen into the skin of the forearm intradermally. A small wheal or blister may develop at the injection site. Interpretation: The reaction at the injection site is observed, and induration is measured after a period of time, usually 48-72 hours. Early reaction: Fernandez (within 24-48 hours) (Option A) Late reaction: Mitsuda (within 4-7 days) Fig. Induration after injection of Mitsuda Antigen Clinical Significance : A negative or weak reaction suggests anergy, which may be seen in lepromatous or borderline lepromatous leprosy. A positive reaction may be seen in tuberculoid forms of leprosy (strong immune response)",

      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Correct answer: C) Slit skin smear Explanation: This clinical vignette is suggestive of a patient with Leprosy A slit skin smear is performed by taking a sample from the earlobes or lesions and staining for acid-fast bacilli is done, which is diagnostic for leprosy. Procedure:- Identification criteria :- based on Bacteriological index(BI) BI: Density or concentration of bacilli (live or dead) 1-10 bacilli in 100 oil immersion fields 1+ 1-10 bacilli in 10 fields 2+ 1-10 bacilli per field 3+ 10-100 bacilli per field 4+ 100-1000 bacilli per field 5+ >1000 bacilli per field 6+ Diascopy(Option A): Diascopy is used to determine the nature of erythema or lesions by applying pressure with a glass slide. It helps to differentiate erythema from purpura but is not useful for diagnosing hypopigmented, anaesthetic lesions in leprosy. Lepromin Test(Option B): The Lepromin test is not a diagnostic test for leprosy. It is used to determine the type of immune response (cell-mediated immunity) a person has to Mycobacterium leprae. It can help classify the form of leprosy and give an estimate of the patient's prognosis, but it does not confirm the presence of the disease itself. Wood’s Lamp Examination(Option D): This examination is primarily used to assess for fluorescent pigments or substances in the skin, such as in the case of fungal infections or certain pigmentation disorder s, but it may not be specific enough to confirm the diagnosis in this case.",

      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Correct answer: C) Rifampicin acts by inhibiting RNA-dependent DNA polymerase Explanation: Rifampicin inhibits DNA-dependent RNA polymerase , not RNA-dependent DNA polymerase. This inhibition interferes with bacterial RNA synthesis, ultimately leading to bactericidal activity against Mycobacterium leprae. (Option A): Fluoroquinolones, such as pefloxacin and ofloxacin have remarkable bactericidal activity against M. leprae, and they are considered potential second-line drugs (Option B): Mechanism of Action: Dapsone, also known as DDS (4,4-diaminodiphenylsulphone), acts by blocking folic acid synthesis in bacteria. It is weakly bactericidal against Mycobacterium leprae. Side Effects: Common side effects include mild hemolysis(hence C/I in G6PD def), rarely leading to anaemia, and rarely psychosis. The DDS syndrome , characterized by exfoliative dermatitis, lymphadenopathy, fever, and hepatitis, may occur. Agranulocytosis, hepatitis, and cholestatic jaundice are rare. Dosage: The recommended dosage is 100 mg orally, and it has a long half-life averaging 28 hours. (Option D): Clofazimine: II It has weak bactericidal activity against mycobacterium leprae & causes the deposition of crystals in the intestinal mucosa, liver, lymph nodes & spleen.

        "D": "Common peroneal nerve"
      },
      "correct_answer": "D",
      "explanation": "Correct answer: D) Common peroneal nerve Explanation: The common peroneal nerve , located in the leg, is commonly affected in leprosy. This nerve involvement can significantly impact mobility and function in affected individuals, resulting in neurological deficits such as foot drop and sensory loss over the dorsum of the foot. Common peroneal nerve lesions cause difficulty in dorsiflexion and eversion of the foot and anaesthesia of the outer border of the foot, a combination which predisposes to traumatic damage and plantar ulceration Motor nerve deficits in leprosy:- Surface markings of all the nerves commonly affected in Leprosy:- Median nerve(Option A) : The median nerve innervates the hand and forearm. While it can be affected in leprosy, involvement of the median nerve typically presents with symptoms such as weakness and sensory loss in the hand and fingers, resulting in total claw hand , rather than foot drop and dorsum of foot sensory loss. Ulnar nerve(Option B): The ulnar nerve innervates the hand and forearm. While it can also be affected in leprosy, involvement of the ulnar nerve typically presents with symptoms such as weakness and sensory loss in the hand and fingers resulting in partial claw hand , rather than foot drop and dorsum of foot sensory loss. most common affected peripheral nerve / overall. Radial nerve(Option C) : The radial nerve innervates the posterior aspect of the arm and forearm. In leprosy, involvement of the radial nerve is less common compared to the common peroneal nerve. It typically presents with weakness in forearm and wrist extension resulting in wrist drop , rather than foot drop and dorsum of foot sensory loss. most common nerve to be biopsied -Radial cutaneous > sural nerve",

        "C": "Vasculitis",
        "D": "Psoriasis"
      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Correct answer: B) Type 1 lepra reaction Explanation: History of a pre-existing skin lesion on the face turning red and swollen, along with significant oedema of the hands and feet, is indicative of Type 1 lepra reaction Pain and tenderness over multiple nerves are other characteristic features of Type 1 lepra reaction. Type 1 lepra reaction is a type IV hypersensitivity reaction , that typically occurs in patients with borderline leprosy (BT, BB, or BL disease). It is characterized by an inflammatory response to Mycobacterium leprae antigens usually seen on starting MDT, resulting in a sudden exacerbation of pre-existing skin lesions and nerve involvement. Type 1 lepra reactions can be upgrading (on treatment) or downgrading (in pregnancy) Type 2 lepra, also known as erythema nodosum leprosum (ENL), is a type III hypersensitivity reaction . It mainly occurs in patients with lepromatous leprosy (BL and LL disease). It is characterized by a sudden cropping of inflammatory skin nodules, often on the extensor surfaces of the limbs and face. Type I & II Lepra Reactions (ENL= Erythema Nodosum Leprosum): Type 1 Lepra Reaction Type 2 Lepra Reaction Hypersensitivity/Pathogenesis Type IV Type III Leprosy type Borderline: BT BB BL Lepromatous pole: LL,BL Predisposing factor This happens after the initiation of MDT Stress, infections and pregnancy Clinical features Pre-existing lesions become red, swollen and tender. No new lesions New lesions are seen. Red tender & evanescent nodules -> ENL Arthritis Orchitis Iridocyclitis Constitutional symptoms and organ involvement are seen more in type 2 reactions than in type 1 reactions. Lepra reactions are seen in 30 to 50 percent of all leprosy patients Cellulitis (Option A): Bacterial skin infection affecting the lower dermis and subcutaneous tissue that presents as a painful, red, swelling of the affected area. Although it is acute in onset, like lepra reaction, the presentation is different. Usually history of injury is present Psoriasis (Option C): It is a chronic autoimmune skin condition characterized by red, scaly patches on the skin, over the elbows, knees, scalp, and lower back. Erythema multiforme (Option D): Erythema multiforme is a hypersensitivity reaction characterized by target-like lesions on the skin and mucous membranes. It can be triggered by infections or medications but is not associated with the clinical presentation described in the scenario,",

      "options": {
        "B": "Antibiotics"
      },
      "correct_answer": "D",
      "explanation": "III Continue MDT and add oral steroids Correct answer: D) III Continue MDT and add oral steroids Explanation: Corticosteroids and thalidomide are mainstay treatments for type 2 lepra reactions II In patients with lepra reactions, MDT is never discontinued in order to prevent the development of drug resistance and further progression of the disease. MDT is considered safe in pregnancy. A Type 2 lepra reaction, also known as Erythema Nodosum Leprosum (ENL) , is a type 3 hypersensitivity reaction that occurs in lepromatous and borderline lepromatous leprosy, which can present with painful nodules, fever, malaise, and other systemic symptoms. II Corticosteroids: Treatment of choice. They help reduce inflammation and immune response. Thalidomide: II Only severe cases of type-2 lepra reaction or erythema nodosum leprosum are treated with Thalidomide. Thalidomide is the gold standard for type II Lepra reaction, but it is NOT the drug of choice due to its cost factor & also its adverse drug reaction profile. Alternative drugs: Methotrexate, clofazimine, or tumour necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-a) inhibitors (Option A): Stopping MDT is not advisable because it can increase the bacterial load and risk the development of drug resistance. (Option B): While antibiotics are a part of MDT to treat the bacterial infection, they alone are not sufficient to address the acute inflammatory symptoms of a Type 2 lepra reaction. (Option C) Thalidomide: II Thalidomide is an effective treatment for Type 2 lepra reactions due to its potent anti-inflammatory properties. II However, it is absolutely contraindicated in pregnant women due to the risk of phocomelia in the first trimester. Reference: Rook's Textbook of Dermatology -9th Edition Chapter 28 Page No 28.16",
