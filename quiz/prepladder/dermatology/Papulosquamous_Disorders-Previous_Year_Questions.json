      "explanation": "this test, gentle scraping of the lesion leads to removal of scales in a characteristic manner, revealing a shiny, thin membrane (Auspitz sign) and pinpoint bleeding. Other Options: Nikolsky Test (Option A) : Used to diagnose conditions like pemphigus vulgaris and toxic epidermal necrolysis . It involves applying lateral pressure to the skin, which causes the epidermis to slough off. Asboe-Hansen Test (Option B) : Also known as the bulla spread sign , it helps diagnose pemphigus vulgaris by checking if pressure on a blister spreads it to adjacent skin. Tzanck Smear( Option D) : Used to diagnose herpes infections by detecting multinucleated giant cells in skin lesions. Reference: Neena Khanna, Textbook of Dermatology, 7th Edition, Page no: 124",

      "explanation": "Correct Answer: A) Impetigo Explanation: The lesion shown in the image has the following classic features: Location : Perioral (around the mouth) Appearance : Reddish base with overlying golden-yellow or honey-coloured crusts Surface : Crusted, shallow erosions without deep ulceration or scarring Distribution : Localised, possibly multiple lesions No systemic symptoms : Usually mild or absent fever These clinical features are hallmark signs of impetigo , especially the non-bullous type. Impetigo is a highly contagious superficial bacterial skin infection , most common in children . Causative organisms : Staphylococcus aureus (most common) Streptococcus pyogenes (Group A strep) Chickenpox (Option B): It presents with a generalised vesicular rash on an erythematous base (\"dew drop on a rose petal\") in different stages of healing. Typically starts on the trunk , not just around the mouth. Herpes Simplex (Option C): It shows painful grouped vesicles , later forming ulcers or crusts. Lesions recur and are often associated with burning or tingling sensations. HSV lesions are clear vesicles , not honey-coloured crusts. Molluscum Contagiosum (Option D): It presents as small, dome-shaped, pearly papules with central umbilication . Lesions are not crusted or erosive , and there is no honey-coloured appearance .

Isomorphic phenomenon Explanation: The above image depicts Pustular psoriasis, which is a chronic inflammatory skin condition characterized by well-demarcated, erythematous plaques covered with silvery-white scales. Isomorphic phenomenon: The isomorphic phenomenon is the correct finding associated with the image. In individuals with psoriasis, new psoriatic lesions can appear at sites of skin trauma, such as scratches, cuts, or other forms of injury. Koebner's Phenomenon Psoriatic lesions develop along the lines of trauma. Isomorphic response All or none phenomenon Category Examples Category 1 (True koebnerization) Psoriasis, Lichen planus, Vitiligo Category 2 (Pseudo koebnerization) Warts, Molluscum Category 3 (Occasional koebnerization) Darier disease, Erythema multiforme Category 4 (Dubious association with trauma) Pemphigus vulgaris, Lupus erythematosus Incorrect Options: Meyerson phenomenon (Option B): The Meyerson phenomenon refers to the development of psoriatic lesions after light tapping or pressure on a psoriatic plaque. Gottron's papule (Option C): Gottron's papule appear as flat-topped, violaceous eruptions overlying the joints of the fingers and elbows. Nikolsky's sign (Option D): Nikolsky's sign refers to the ability to induce blistering or detachment of the superficial skin layers by lateral pressure or rubbing (positive Nikolsky's sign).

      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: C) Oral steroids Explanation: In the case of a patient with chronic plaque psoriasis involving more than 50% of the skin, oral steroids are generally not recommended as a long-term treatment option due to the risk of severe rebound flares and pustular psoriasis upon withdrawal. Reasons Why Oral Steroids Are Avoided Rebound Phenomenon Sudden discontinuation can cause severe exacerbation of psoriasis, leading to erythroderma or pustular psoriasis (potentially life-threatening). Risk of Pustular Psoriasis Systemic steroids can trigger generalized pustular psoriasis (GPP) , characterized by widespread sterile pustules, fever, and systemic illness. Limited Long-Term Efficacy While steroids provide short-term relief , they do not alter disease progression and often require higher doses over time , leading to dependency. Preferred Long-Term Treatment Options Biologics (e.g., IL-17, IL-23, TNF inhibitors) Methotrexate, cyclosporine, or apremilast (for systemic therapy) (Option A and C) Phototherapy ( NB-UVB- Narrowband ultraviolet B) (Option B) Topical therapies (vitamin D analogs, corticosteroids, calcineurin inhibitors) for localized disease Reference: Illustrated Synopsis of Dermatology and Sexually Transmitted Diseases, Fifth Edition – Neena Khanna Pg 55-60",

It reduces inflammation and alleviates the symptoms of arthritis. Treatment: Medical: NSAIDs Immuno suppressive agents- methotrexate and TNF inhibitors Local glucocorticoid injections Physiotherapy Surgery: For unstable joints. Arthrodesis procedure. Incorrect Options: PUVA (Option A): PUVA does not work effectively in reducing the arthritic condition. Methotrexate is preferred over PUVA for the treatment of Psoriatic arthritis. Steroids (Option B): Oral and topical corticosteroids can be used for short-term therapy but are not recommended for long-term use due to their many adverse effects. Infliximab (Option D): Infliximab is preferred in moderate to severe cases of Psoriatic arthritis but is not the first drug of choice due to it",

Most prominent around the edges of herald patches . Silvery scales – Psoriasis (2-c) Thick, silvery-white scales over erythematous plaques , classically seen in psoriasis . Removal may lead to Auspitz sign (pinpoint bleeding). Mica-like scales – Pityriasis lichenoides (3-d) Fine, adherent mica-like scales covering small, erythematous papules. Seen in pityriasis lichenoides , a chronic inflammatory skin condition. Branny scales – Pityriasis versicolour (4-a) Fine, powdery, branny scales seen in pityriasis versicolour , a superficial fungal infection caused by Malassezia .

      "explanation": "Correct Answer: A) Christmas tree pattern - Pityriasis rosea Explanation: The image depicts an asymptomatic Collarette scale. This presentation is characteristic of Pityriasis rosea, a common skin condition that often begins with a single, large, scaly plaque known as the \"herald patch.\" The subsequent rash that follows often has a distinctive \"Christmas tree pattern\" on the trunk, which corresponds to the orientation of the lesions. Wickham's striae - Lichen planus (Option B): Wickham's striae is a term used to describe the fine white lines or dots that are characteristic of Lichen planus, a chronic inflammatory condition. However, Lichen planus typically presents with polygonal, flat-topped papules rather than the described Collarette scale. Christmas tree pattern - Lichen planus (Option C): Lichen planus is characterized by Wickham's striae, as mentioned above. However, the description of a Collarette scale is more indicative of Pityriasis rosea. Woronoff ring - Seborrheic dermatitis (Option D): A Woronoff ring refers to a ring-shaped area of clearing or central healing within a skin lesion. It is not specifically associated with Seborrheic dermatitis. Seborrheic dermatitis typically presents with erythematous, scaly plaques in areas rich in sebaceous glands, such as the scalp and face.

Incorrect Options Option B - Lichen nitidus : Histology of lichen nitidus showing well-defined granuloma enclosed by rete pegs giving the appearance of \"claw clutching a ball\" Option C - Lichen planus: The histological image is consistent with lichen planus, showing a dense band-like lymphocytic infiltrate at the dermo-epidermal junction and saw-toothing of the rete ridges.",

The patient's symptoms of red and scaly skin lesions along with painful and swollen finger joints are indicative of psoriatic arthritis. This condition can cause joint pain, stiffness, and swelling, and it is commonly associated with skin manifestations like psoriasis. Incorrect Options: Option B - Pseudo gout: Pseudo gout is a type of arthritis caused by the deposition of calcium pyrophosphate crystals in the joints. It can also lead to joint inflammation and pain, but it typically doesn't have an association with skin lesions like psoriasis. The symptoms described in the case, including the skin lesions, make psoriatic arthritis a more likely diagnosis.
