      },
      "correct_answer": "D",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: D) Cryotherapy is a painless procedure Explanation: The main disadvantage of Cryotherapy / Freezing is pain. Cryotherapy: Liquid nitrogen, carbon dioxide snow, and dimethyl ether can all cause thermal injury to the skin. Liquid nitrogen, which is frequently employed in practice, produces the coldest freeze. A cotton wool bud or cryospray is applied until a rim of iced tissue forms around the wart (visible as a white discoloration). Depending on the size and location of the wart, the freezing is maintained for 5 to 30 seconds, therefore scarring is unlikely. Cryotherapy is safer than imiquimod, podophyllin, and podofilox, which are teratogenic. Plantar warts: Verruca vulgaris (common wart) is most commonly caused by HPV types 1, 4, 27,",

      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: B) Cold sore Explanation: The given clinical scenario of a patient with painful and pruritic lesions (small, closely grouped vesicles ) associated with fever in the past presenting with similar symptoms suggests herpes labialis (cold sore). Herpes labialis/cold sore: Reactivation of latent infection in trigeminal ganglion, causing asymptomatic shedding or clinically evident recurrent disease. Causative organism: HSV-1 > HSV-2 . Features: Painful and pruritic lesions. Fever is often present, which subsides in 3-5 days. The initial vesicular lesions become pustular and then crusted before healing in 7-10 days without scarring . Can be associated with itching or burning before the development of lesions. Recurrent herpetic lesions are vesicular and ulcerative and tend to occur in the same region. Treatment : Treatment Line Drugs First Line Acyclovir (topical/oral) Hydrocolloid dressing Other Drugs Topical penciclovir Prophylactic acyclovir Varicella (Option A) presents with papules and vesicles on an erythematous base with a centripetal distribution associated with systemic symptoms of fever and malaise. Molluscum contagiosum (Option C) presents with shiny, pearly white umbilicated papules. Whitlow (Option D) presents with painful swelling of the fingertips and periungual area due to herpes infection by inoculation.",

      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: B) Foscarnet. Explanation: Acyclovir is the cornerstone therapy for herpes infections because it is a competitive inhibitor of viral DNA polymerase. It requires phosphorylation, to be converted to its active form. Resistance occurs primarily due to Mutations in the viral thymidine kinase (TK) gene Alterations in viral DNA polymerase that diminish the ability of acyclovir to be phosphorylated into its active form Clinically, acyclovir-resistant herpes infections may manifest as persistent or recurrent lesions that do not respond to standard acyclovir therapy Alternative antiviral agents such as foscarnet, cidofovir, or brivudine may be considered for treatment. Lamivudine (Option A) – Not effective against herpes viruses; primarily used for hepatitis B and HIV as a reverse transcriptase inhibitor. Valacyclovir (Option C) – A prodrug of acyclovir,",

Neonatal herpes is transmitted from mother to newborn during childbirth or within 28 days of it Neonatal herpes has a high mortality of >60%. Features of Neonatal Herpes Localized Disease: Symptoms localized to the skin, eyes, or mouth. Infants may present with vesicular lesions, ulcerations, or erythema in these areas. Disseminated Disease: Includes hepatomegaly, splenomegaly, jaundice, respiratory distress, and coagulopathy. Disseminated disease can rapidly progress to multiorgan failure. Associated with high mortality in neonates ~85% Herpes Simplex Encephalitis: Infants may present with nonspecific symptoms such as fever, irritability, lethargy, and poor feeding, which can rapidly progress to seizures, altered consciousness, focal neurologic deficits, and coma. Most common part involved here is temporal lobe Neonatal herpes is treated with high-dose intravenous acyclovir followed by oral acyclovir for 6 months. Treatment of Herpes during pregnancy: Current Active Lesion Acyclovir 5 x 200mg for 10 days History of Active lesions in pregnancy Acyclovir from 36 weeks gestational age till delivery If active lesions present during labor LSCS Cesarean section may reduce the risk of infection in the baby (Option A) – C-section is recommended to prevent neonatal herpes transmission in mothers with active genital lesions during labor. This condition is commonly caused by HSV-2 (Option C) – Genital herpes is most often caused by HSV-2, though HSV-1 can also be responsible in some cases. Prophylactic acyclovir should be considered for her neonate (Option D) – Neonates exposed to HSV should receive IV acyclovir promptly to reduce the risk of severe complications.

      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: B) Maculopapular rash is seen. Explanation: Herpes zoster : A maculopapular rash is not seen in zoster (shingles). Herpes zoster (shingles) leads to vesicular lesions that are grouped together in a dermatomal / Segmental distribution (shown in the image mentioned below). Varicella-zoster virus (VZV) Is a human herpesvirus that causes varicella (chickenpox) as a primary infection, Infectious period: 2 days before the development of rash till all the lesions have crusted. Pleomorphic rash, distributed mainly over the trunk. Vesicles: Dew drops on rose petal appearance. It then remains in a latent form in the dorsal root ganglia (Option A) for variable periods. It can reactivate to cause herpes zoster (shingles), which leads to vesicular lesions grouped together in a dermatomal / Segmental distribution. The mucous membranes within the affected dermatomes are involved (Option D) Symptoms: The first symptom of zoster is usually pain, 1-3 days after which the lesions appear. The dermatomes of T3 to L3 spinal segments are most affected in all ages ( Thoracic and lumbar dermatomes). The posterior nerve roots and ganglia show inflammatory changes. The patients are infectious, both from the virus in the lesions and nasopharynx. Treatment: Zoster is painful and carries a risk of secondary infection and post-herpetic neuralgia. All cases of herpes zoster should be treated with Acyclovir, administered at a dosage of 800 mg five times a day . It is most effective when the treatment is initiated within 72 hours of the onset of infection.",

        "D": "She is immune to chickenpox"
      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: B) She is susceptible to chickenpox Explanation: The absence of antibodies against VZV indicates that the patient is susceptible to primary VZV infection, commonly known as chickenpox. VZV causes exanthematous lesions in children (chickenpox), in adults (shingles or zoster), and in pregnancy. Varicella zoster (Chickenpox) in pregnancy: Chickenpox in pregnancy can affect both the mother and the fetus. Mothers are at high risk of developing varicella pneumonia . The fetus can develop two types of infection, depending on the gestational period at which it acquires the infection. When maternal varicella occurs during the first half of pregnancy , the fetal infection can be asymptomatic or can manifest as congenital varicella syndrome , characterized by: Most characteristic anomalies Cicatrizing skin lesions and limb hypoplasia CNS defects Microcephaly, mental retardation, and seizures Ocular defects Chorioretinitis, microphthalmia, and cataract Renal system defects Hydroureter and hydronephrosis ANS defect Neurogenic bladder Others Low birth weight When the fetal infection occurs near delivery, the baby may develop congenital (neonatal varicella) within two weeks of birth: If the mother develops chickenpox >5 days before delivery The baby is mostly asymptomatic due to protective maternal antibody which prevents the transmission of the virus during delivery If the mother develops chickenpox 5 days before to 2 days after delivery Maternal antibodies would not have been produced in such a short time → The virus is dispersed in the baby → N eonatal varicella , a severe form with a high mortality rate (high risk of pneumonia and encephalitis). Susceptibility to Herpes Zoster (Shingles) in Pregnancy: Though herpes zoster has a very low infectivity rate, since there are no antibodies in the mother, she is susceptible to the infection. Management: Any patient diagnosed with primary varicella infection or herpes zoster should be isolated from pregnant women. Exposed gravidas with a negative clinical history or prior chickenpox or vaccination should undergo VZV serological testing. At least 70% of these women will be seropositive and thus immune . Indications for VZIG administration : Best given within 96 hours of exposure Immunocompromised patients without evidence of immunity. Newborn infants whose mothers have signs and symptoms of varicella around the time of delivery (i.e., 5 days before to 2 days after ). Hospitalized premature infants born at ≥ 28 weeks of gestation whose mothers do not have evidence of immunity to varicella. Hospitalized premature infants born at <28 weeks of gestation or who weigh ≤ 1,000 g at birth, regardless of their mother’s evidence of immunity to varicella. Pregnant women",
