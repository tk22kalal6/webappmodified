        "A": "Actinomyces",
        "B": "Propionibacterium",
        "C": "Mobiluncus",
        "D": "Bifidobacterium"

      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "of the rare and severe form of acne known as acne fulminans. The exact cause of acne fulminans, on the other hand, is still poorly understood. Genetic predisposition, hormonal imbalances, and certain medications like isotretinoin are additional factors that could contribute to the onset of this condition. The genus of bacteria known as Propionibacterium is commonly found on human skin, particularly in areas of the face, scalp, and upper back that produce a lot of oil. These Gram-positive bacteria are anaerobic or facultatively anaerobic and do not produce spores. Propionibacterium acnes is known to be engaged with the improvement of skin breakout, in spite of the fact that it is likewise a typical occupant of the skin microbiome and plays other helpful parts in the body. Incorrect choices: Option a. Actinomyces: The bacteria of the genus Actinomyces are typically found in the gastrointestinal tract, throat, and mouth of humans and other animals. Gram-positive, anaerobic or microaerophilic, and filamentous, these bacteria produce long, branching structures that are known as filaments. Actinomyces species are essential members of the human body's normal microbiota and contribute to oral and digestive health. Option c. Mobiluncus: The bacteria in the genus Mobiluncus are anaerobic, Gram-variable, and curved or comma-shaped, like shrimps. These bacteria are frequently found in the female genital tract and are linked to bacterial vaginosis (BV), a condition characterized by an overgrowth of certain bacteria in the vagina that can result in itching, odor, and discharge. Mobiluncus microorganisms are much of the time present in big numbers in females with BV, alongside different microscopic organisms, for example, Gardnerella vaginalis. Option d. Bifidobacterium: Bifidobacterium is a variety of microscopic organisms that are normally tracked down in the human gastrointestinal parcel and different pieces of the body, like the mouth and vagina. These microorganisms are anaerobic, Gram-positive, and non-spore-framing, and they have a trademark Y-or Angular shape. Due to their crucial role in maintaining gut health and immunity, Bifidobacterium species are regarded as beneficial or \"friendly\" bacteria. Reference: .",

      "question": "Which cell is absent from the layer indicated as D?",
      "options": {
        "A": "Keratinocyte",
        "B": "Merkel cell",
        "C": "Melanocyte",
        "D": "Langerhans cells"
      },
      "correct_answer": "D",
      "explanation": "Correct Ans: D Langerhans cells: Langerhans cells are specialized immune cells present in the epidermis. They play a role in immune surveillance and antigen presentation. Langerhans cells are typically found in the more superficial layers of the epidermis, particularly in the stratum spinosum layer. Therefore, Langerhans cells are not present in the marked stratum basale layer. This option is correct. Incorrect Option: Option A. Keratinocyte: Keratinocytes are the predominant cells in the epidermis and are responsible for producing the protein keratin, which contributes to the strength and waterproofing of the skin. Keratinocytes are present in the stratum basale layer, so they are indeed present in the marked layer. This option is incorrect. Option B . Merkel cell: Merkel cells are specialized sensory cells found in the skin that play a role in touch sensation. They are typically found in the stratum basale layer, forming connections with nerve endings. Therefore, Merkel cells are present in the marked layer. This option is incorrect. Option C . Melanocyte: Melanocytes are pigment-producing cells responsible for the production of melanin, which gives color to the skin, hair, and eyes. Melanocytes are primarily located in the stratum basale layer and extend their processes into the surrounding layers. Based on the image, it is not possible to determine the presence of melanocytes in the marked layer. This option is inconclusive.",

      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "red discoloration of the skin caused by bleeding into the skin or mucous membranes. Purpura occurs due to various factors, including vascular fragility, platelet disorders, or clotting abnormalities. It can appear as small pinpoint spots (petechiae) or larger patches (ecchymosis) on the skin. Incorrect Options: Option A - Crust: Crust is not a primary skin lesion but rather a secondary change. It forms when dried exudate or blood accumulates on the skin surface, resulting in a scab or crust. Crusts are commonly seen in conditions like impetigo or eczema, but they are a result of an underlying primary lesion. Option B - Atrophy: Atrophy is not considered a primary skin lesion but a secondary change. It refers to a thinning or wasting of the skin layers, leading to a reduction in skin thickness. Atrophy can occur due to various reasons, such as long-term use of corticosteroids or certain skin diseases. However, it is not an initial or fundamental skin abnormality. Option D - Induration: Induration is also not a primary skin lesion but a secondary feature. It refers to the palpable or firm thickening of the skin, often associated with underlying inflammation, fibrosis, or cellular infiltration. Induration can be observed in conditions such as cellulitis or scleroderma, but it is not the primary skin lesion itself. Reference: .",

Paronychia: is an infection or inflammation of the skin around the nail, specifically the nail folds. It can occur acutely or chronically. Acute paronychia is typically caused by bacterial infection, often by Staphylococcus aureus or Streptococcus pyogenes. Chronic paronychia is often associated with fungal infections, particularly Candida species. Symptoms: redness, swelling, tenderness, and pain around the nail. The affected area may also appear warm and may develop pus-filled abscesses. Commonly seen in: Individuals who frequently immerse their hands in water Who engage in activities that cause minor trauma to the skin around the nails, such as nail biting, picking, or manicuring. Diagnosis: Physical examination of the affected area and evaluate the patient's symptoms. a sample of the pus or discharge may be sent for laboratory analysis to determine the causative organism. Treatment: Warm water soaks, topical antibiotic ointments or creams, and, if necessary, oral antibiotics.",

        "C": "Ciclopirox olamine",
        "D": "Tioconazole"
      },
      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: A. Amorolfine Explanation: Amorolfine is an antifungal medication that belongs to the class of drugs known as morpholines. It is commonly used as a topical nail lacquer for the treatment of fungal infections of the nails, known as onychomycosis. Amorolfine works by inhibiting the growth of fungi, including dermatophytes and yeasts, which are responsible for causing nail infections. Morpholines are a class of organic compounds that contain a morpholine ring structure, which is a saturated heterocycle consisting of a six-membered ring with one oxygen atom and one nitrogen atom. These compounds have diverse applications in the field of pharmaceuticals due to their unique chemical properties. Incorrect Options: Oxiconazole (Option B) : Oxiconazole is not the correct choice for the drug belonging to the morpholines and used as a nail lacquer. It is an antifungal medication, but it belongs to a different class of drugs called imidazoles. Oxiconazole is available in various formulations, including creams and lotions, and is used for the treatment of various fungal skin infections. Ciclopirox olamine (Option C) : Ciclopirox olamine is not the correct choice for the drug belonging to the morpholines and used as a nail lacquer. Although it is an antifungal medication, it belongs to a different class of drugs called hydroxypyridones. Ciclopirox olamine is available as a nail lacquer and is used for the treatment of fungal infections of the nails, including onychomycosis. Tioconazole (Option D) : Tioconazole is not the correct choice for the drug belonging to the morpholines and used as a nail lacquer. It is an antifungal medication that belongs to the class of drugs called imidazoles. Tioconazole is commonly used for the treatment of vaginal yeast infections and is available in various formulations, including creams and ointments.

      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: B) Topical fluocinolone Explanation: Fluocinolone is a topical corticosteroid , which is not recommended for acne . Corticosteroids can worsen acne by promoting follicular occlusion, increasing sebum production, and causing steroid-induced acne . Acne treatment focuses on reducing inflammation, controlling bacterial overgrowth, and regulating keratinisation , which fluocinolone does not address. Acne vulgaris is a chronic inflammatory condition affecting the pilosebaceous units. Pathophysiology: Increased sebum production (hormonal influence). Follicular hyperkeratinisation (plug formation). Bacterial colonisation ( Cutibacterium acnes proliferation). Inflammation (leading to papules, pustules, nodules).

      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: C) Alopecia areata Explanation: Given the patchy nature of the hair loss, alopecia areata is the most likely diagnosis. Alopecia areata: Alopecia areata is a T-cell-mediated autoimmune condition targeting the anagen hair bulb causing non-scarring hair loss. Clinical features include, Localized patches of hair loss on the scalp that emerge over a few weeks. It can also affect other areas, such as the beard, eyebrows, eyelashes, and extremities. Variants: Alopecia Totalis: Complete hair loss from the scalp. Alopecia Universalis: Complete hair loss from all over the body. Ophiasis: Occipital hair loss. Exclamation-mark hair, with a narrower proximal end than the distal end, is commonly observed at the periphery of lesions and is a pathognomonic finding in patients with alopecia areata. Pitting of nails that is superficial, geometric and regular Non-scarring alopecia Exclamation mark hair Regular nail pitting The pull test is positive, Very gentle traction on the unaffected hair at the margin of the patch of hair loss can remove all of the hair from the roots painlessly. It is a distinguishing feature of alopecia areata Tinea capitis (Scalp Ringworm) (Option A): Fungal infection of the scalp, common in children. Presents with scaly patches, broken hairs, and black dots (not smooth bald patches). KOH mount shows fungal hyphae. Can progress to kerion (severe inflammatory form). Kerion (Option B): Severe inflammatory form of tinea capitis with painful, boggy swelling, pustules, and abscesses. Often associated with secondary bacterial infection. More common in children. Androgenic alopecia (Male Pattern Baldness) (Option D): Gradual thinning of hair in a defined pattern (bitemporal recession, vertex baldness). Hormone-related (DHT sensitivity). No well-defined patches of baldness.",

Whole-cell is disintegrated while secretion Examples Eccrine sweat glands. Salivary glands. Globlet cells. Apocrine sweat glands. Mammary glands. Sebaceous glands Palm and soles (Option A) The palms and soles are free of apocrine glands. These areas primarily contain eccrine sweat glands, which are responsible for thermoregulation through merocrine secretion. Face (Option B) While the face contains sebaceous glands and eccrine sweat glands, apocrine glands are absent from the face. The sebaceous glands in the face use holocrine secretion to release sebum, not apocrine mechanisms.

Tinea capitis, Moth-eaten alopecia Correct Optlon B- 1, 2 and 3: 1. Alopecia areata: Alopecia areata is an autoimmune condition that can cause non-scarring alopecia. It typically presents as well-defined, round or oval patches of hair loss on the scalp or other areas of the body. While it can lead to non-scarring alopecia, in some cases, it may progress to involve the entire scalp or body, resulting in complete hair loss. 2. Telogen effluvium: Telogen effluvium is a form of non-scarring alopecia characterized by diffuse hair shedding. It occurs when a large number of hair follicles enter the telogen (resting) phase simultaneously, leading to increased hair loss. It is often triggered by various factors such as childbirth, surgery, illness, or significant stress. 3. Androgenic alopecia: Androgenic alopecia, also known as male-pattern baldness or female-pattern baldness, is a genetic condition that leads to progressive hair thinning. It is a common cause of non-scarring alopecia, especially in a specific pattern on the scalp. Folllculltis Decalvans (Option D): Folliculitis decalvans is a type of scarring alopecia. Folliculitis decalvans typically presents as clusters of small, red, inflamed papules or pustules atthe site of hair follicles, often accompanied by crusting and scaling. Over time, the affected area may progress to form patches of smooth, bald skin with visible scarring. Reference: Chapter 89: Acquired disorders of hair. In: Rook’s Textbook of Dermatology. 9th ed.

TE can also occur during pregnancy, known as Telogen gravidarum. Here, stress causes hair follicles to prematurely enter the resting phase (Telogen) instead of the growth phase (Anagen), leading to hair shedding after about three months. Chronic TE can be caused by factors like iron deficiency, thyroid disorders, crash dieting, or malnutrition. Prolonged exposure to stressors can result in long-term hair loss.

      "explanation": "Correct Answer: B) Condyloma acuminata Explanation: The most likely diagnosis based on the given presentation is Condyloma acuminata, commonly known as genital warts. Genital warts are caused by certain strains of the human papillomavirus (HPV), which is a sexually transmitted infection. They typically appear as raised, flesh-colored or grayish growths on or around the genitals, including the penis in males. In some cases, they can also be found near the anal canal, as mentioned in the scenario. Condyloma acuminata (anogenital warts): Benign, moist, soft, pedunculated wart found on the external genitalia and has low malignant potential. Site: They may be found in the genital area such as the penile shaft, scrotum, or labia majora of the vagina, or in the anal area. Appearance: They are generally pink and project out from the surface of the skin. Size may vary; they usually appear small but can merge into large masses. Microscopy: A branching villous structure with connective tissue stroma. Epidermis showing hyperkeratosis and acanthosis (thickening). Cytoplasmic vacuolization of the squamous cells ( koilocytosis ) is Characteristic. No evidence of dysplasia. The table below shows the clinical features of HPV and the types responsible for various lesions: Clinical lesion Oncogenic potential HPV types Plantar warts Benign 1 Common skin warts Benign 2, 4, 27, 57 Epidermodysplasia verrucosa Mostly benign, rarely progresses to malignancy 5, 8, 9, 12, 17 Anogenital warts Laryngeal papilloma Intraepithelial neoplasia Low malignant potential 6, 11 Palmar warts in butchers Low malignant potential 7 Carcinomas of the cervix & other genital mucosa/larynx/oesophagus High malignant potential 16, 18, 31, 33, 45, 51, 52, 56, 58, 59, 68 Penile cancer (Option A): Penile cancer refers to the malignant growth of cells in the penis.

      },
      "correct_answer": "D",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: D) Don’t involve in intercourse when active lesions are present Explanation: Genital warts are caused by the human papillomavirus (HPV) and can be transmitted through sexual contact. When a female patient presents with active genital warts and a history of recurrence, it is important to provide appropriate advice to prevent transmission to her partner. The most effective measure to prevent transmission of genital warts is to avoid sexual intercourse when active lesions are present. This is because the virus is most contagious and easily transmitted when the warts are actively present Treatment for genital warts involves both individual and partner management Individual Treatment: Topical Medications: Various topical medications can be prescribed to treat genital warts. These include: Imiquimod cream/Trichloroacetic acid (TCA) or bichloroacetic acid (BCA): These acids are applied directly to the warts to destroy them. Surgical Procedures These procedures include: Cryotherapy Electrocautery Surgical excision Partner Management: It is important to inform the partner about the presence of genital warts so that they can also seek appropriate medical evaluation and treatment if necessary. It is best to avoid sexual activity, especially during active wart outbreaks, to prevent transmission to the partner. Incorrect Options: Give continuous prophylaxis to the patient (Option A) : Prophylactic treatments such as topical creams or vaccines are typically used for individuals who have not yet contracted the virus or to prevent future outbreaks. Give prophylactic antivirals to the husband (Option B) : Antiviral medications are primarily used for the treatment of active infections or to reduce the severity and duration of outbreaks, but they do not provide long-term protection against transmission. Give antivirals whenever active lesions are present (Option C) : While antiviral medications can be used to treat active genital warts and reduce the duration of outbreaks, using them solely when active lesions are present is not the most effective approach to prevent transmission.

      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: B) Syphilis Explanation: The clinical presentation of a single painless genital ulcer with raised edges and a clean base, accompanied by painless swelling of the inguinal lymph nodes , strongly suggests primary syphilis . Syphilis is a sexually transmitted infection caused by the spirochete bacterium Treponema pallidum . Primary syphilis typically manifests as a chancre , which is a painless ulcer appearing at the site of inoculation. The associated lymphadenopathy is also painless, helping to differentiate syphilis from other sexually transmitted infections. Treatment of syphilis: Primary, secondary, and early latent syphilis: A single intramuscular injection of benzathine penicillin G 2.4 million units . Late latent syphilis or tertiary syphilis (excluding neurosyphilis): Benzathine penicillin G 2.4 million units IM weekly for 3 weeks . Neurosyphilis: Intravenous aqueous crystalline penicillin G at 18–24 million units daily, divided into doses every 4 hours or by continuous infusion for 10–14 days . Incorrect Options: Option A) Chancroid: Chancroid is caused by Haemophilus ducreyi and presents as a painful genital ulcer with irregular edges, often accompanied by tender, suppurative inguinal lymphadenopathy (buboes). Option C) Herpes genitalis: Caused by Herpes simplex virus (HSV) , it presents with multiple painful vesicles or ulcers on the genital area, often associated with burning or itching sensations. Option D) Granuloma inguinale: Caused by Klebsiella granulomatis , it presents as beefy red ulcers that bleed easily on touch, with no associated lymphadenopathy. The ulcers are typically painless but have a different appearance than the chancre of syphilis. Reference: Fitzpatrick Dermatology, 9th Edition, Page 3160.

      "explanation": "Correct Answer: A) LGV Explanation: A bubo is an enlarged, tender, and suppurative lymph node commonly associated with Lymphogranuloma Venereum (LGV), a sexually transmitted infection caused by Chlamydia trachomatis Lymphogranuloma venerum (LGV): It is a sexually transmitted disease caused by serovars L1-L3 of Chlamydia trachomatis (M/C strain causing LGV: L2 ). It occurs in sexually active adults of all ages. It can cause LGV-associated proctitis in homosexuals, associated with HIV and hepatitis C co-infection. The incubation period of LGV is around 3-30 days , and the disease presents in three stages, described in the table below: Primary Secondary Tertiary 3-30 days Days-weeks Years after a chronic, untreated infection Small papule/pustule/ Non-indurated ulcer at the site of inoculation which heals spontaneously with no scarring. Lymphatic involvement of nodes that drain the primary lesion. Classic form: Tender unilateral or bilateral inguinal and/or femoral adenopathy (Groove sign of Greenblatt). The lymph nodes may coalesce to form a bubo or abscesses that may rupture spontaneously with the development of Fistulae or sinus tracts. There may be systemic features such as malaise and fever. Lymphatic obstruction due to chronic inflammation leads to fistula formation, strictures, and disfiguring conditions such as genital elephantiasis and esthiomene , which refers to hypertrophic enlargement with ulceration of the external genitalia. Diagnosis of LGV can be confirmed by the Nucelic Acid Amplification Test (NAAT). Antibody detection by real-time PCR can also be done. Treatment includes: First line: Doxycycline 100mg BD x 21 days. Second line: Erythromycin 500mg 4 times a day x 21 days. Third line: Azithromycin 1g weekly once x 21 days.
