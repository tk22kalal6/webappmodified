      "question": "A patient presents with loss of sensation on the posterior surface of the ear along with a lesion. Which structure is most likely involved?",
      "options": {
        "A": "Greater Auricular Nerve",
        "B": "Internal Jugular Vein",
        "C": "External Jugular Vein",
        "D": "External Carotid Artery"
      },
      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "innervation to: The posterior surface of the ear . The skin over the angle of the mandible and parotid gland . Part of the posterior auricular region . Lesions affecting this nerve can lead to loss of sensation in these areas. Other options: Internal Jugular Vein (Option B) : A major venous structure that drains blood from the head and neck but does not contribute to sensory innervation . External Jugular Vein (Option C) : Also a venous structure , responsible for draining superficial areas of the head, but not involved in sensation. External Carotid Artery (Option D) : A major arterial supply to the face and scalp, but it does not play a role in sensory innervation .

        "D": "Acantholytic cells"
      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: B) Multinucleated giant cells Explanation: The image given in the question is of Herpes labialis which is caused by Herpes simplex virus. Fever is one of the predisposing factor of Herpes labialis It is also called cold sore. It is usually present on the vermillion border of the lips. Smear is taken from the base of the vesicle Multinucleated giant cells and Acantholytic cells are present on Tzanck smear Herpes labialis/cold sore: Reactivation of latent infection in trigeminal ganglion, causing asymptomatic shedding or clinically evident recurrent disease. Causative organism: HSV-1 > HSV-2 . Features: Painful and pruritic lesions. Fever is often present, which subsides in 3-5 days. The initial vesicular lesions become pustular and then crusted before healing in 7-10 days without scarring . Can be associated with itching or burning before the development of lesions. Recurrent herpetic lesions are vesicular and ulcerative and tend to occur in the same region. Treatment : First line Acyclovir (topical/oral) Hydrocolloid dressing Topical penciclovir Second line Long-term prophylactic acyclovir Third line IV acyclovir Penciclovir Foscarnet IV cidofovir Topical imiquimod Handerson patterson bodies (Option A): Handerson patterson bodies is a histologic finding seen in Molluscum contagiosum. Owl eye appearance (Option C): refers to basophilic intranuclear inclusions surrounded by a clear halo, characteristic of Cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection. Acanthosis (Option D): Acanthosis is a histopathological finding seen in Chronic eczema. Reference: Rooks textbook of dermatology 9th ed, page no. 25.17-25.19",

      },
      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: C) Erythema multiforme Explanation: Erythema multiforme is usually seen as a reaction to drugs or HSV. It presents as target lesions on the palms, soles, or trunk. It shows a dusky, central area or blister, a dark red inflammatory zone surrounded by a pale ring of edema, and an erythematous halo on the extreme periphery of the lesion. Urticaria (Option A): It usually presents as wheals&nbsp; (erythematous, edematous, itchy, and evanescent lesions). They are small and multiple as shown below: Viral exanthem (Option B): Exanthems usually start in the trunk and spread to other parts Tinea manuum (Option D): Skin lesions caused by dermatophytes in the palms. It is a circular ring-shaped scaly lesion.",

      "question": "A 3-year-old child is brought to the clinic with a generalized vesicular rash covering the entire body. The child's parents report that the rash started as red spots and quickly developed into fluid-filled blisters. The child also has a mild fever and is feeling irritable. What is the most likely diagnosis for this child's condition?",
      "options": {
        "A": "Varicella",
        "B": "Shingles",
        "C": "Smallpox",
        "D": "Dermatomyocytis"
      },
      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "Varicella is a viral infection caused by the varicella-zoster virus (VZV). It typically presents with a generalized vesicular rash that starts as red spots and quickly develops into fluid-filled blisters. The child may also have a mild fever and feel irritable. Chickenpox is common in children and is highly contagious. The vesicles eventually crust over and heal. It's important to note that a vaccine is available for varicella, which has greatly reduced the incidence of the disease. Incorrect Options: Option B - Shingles (Herpes Zoster): Shingles is also caused by the varicella-zoster virus. However, it typically occurs in adults who had chickenpox earlier in life. Shingles presents as a painful, localized vesicular rash along a specific dermatome (nerve pathway). It is less likely in a 3-year-old child and would present differently than the generalized rash described in the scenario. Option C - Smallpox: Smallpox is a highly contagious viral infection caused by the variola virus. However, smallpox has been eradicated from the general population due to successful vaccination efforts, and it hasn't been reported since the late 1970s. The symptoms and presentation of smallpox are different from the scenario described. Option D - Dermatomyositis: Dermatomyositis is a rare inflammatory disease that affects the muscles and skin. It typically presents with muscle weakness and a characteristic skin rash, but the rash pattern and symptoms are distinct from the generalized vesicular rash described in the scenario. Reference: .",

      "question": "Which of the following does not exhibit the Koebner's phenomenon?",
      "options": {
        "A": "Vitiligo",
        "B": "Psoriasis",
        "C": "Lichen planus",
        "D": "Herpes"
      },
      "correct_answer": "D",
      "explanation": "also known as the isomorphic response. It is a typical finding in a few skin conditions, including psoriasis, lichen planus, vitiligo, and morphea. Koebner's peculiarity isn't found in all skin conditions, nonetheless, and one condition in which it is commonly not noticed is rosacea. Incorrect choices: Option a. Vitiligo: Vitiligo is an immune system sickness. When the immune system attacks melanocyte-containing cells in the body it results in vitiligo. These are pigment-making cells. Option b. Psoriasis: Psoriasis is a skin condition that typically manifests as a rash with itchy, scaly patches on the scalp, trunk, knees, and elbows. Psoriasis is a prevalent, chronic, and long-term condition that has no cure. Option c. Lichen planus: Lichen planus is a condition of the skin, hair, nails, mouth, and genitals. On the skin, lichen planus often appears as purple, itchy, flat bumps that develop over several weeks.",
