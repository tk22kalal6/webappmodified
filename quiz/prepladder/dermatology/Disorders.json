      "explanation": "Correct answer: B)Pencil-in-cup deformity Explanation: Pencil-in-cup deformity The \"pencil-in-cup\" deformity is a characteristic radiographic finding in patients with psoriatic arthritis. Psoriatic arthritis occurs mainly in HLA B-27 positive patients and is seronegative . It results from erosive changes at the joint margins, leading to bony proliferation and destruction, causing the proximal bone to taper into the distal bone. It is often seen in the distal interphalangeal (DIP) joints and is indicative of severe joint damage in psoriatic arthritis. The tapered phalanx is also called the ‘mouse ear deformity.’ Ivory phalanx (Option A) occurs due to new bone formation in psoriatic arthritis ; the phalanx may appear whiter due to sclerosis. Boutonniere deformity (Option C) is commonly seen in rheumatoid arthritis, and involves flexion of the proximal interphalangeal (PIP) joint with hyperextension of the distal interphalangeal (DIP) joint. Fraying (Option D): Irregularity and thinning of the cortex of long bones, particularly at the metaphyses, resulting in a fuzzy or frayed appearance seen in vitamin C",

Pityriasis Rubra Pilaris is characterized by a histopathological finding known as the checkerboard pattern, which consists of alternate areas of hyperkeratosis (thickening of the stratum corneum) and parakeratosis (retention of nuclei in the stratum corneum). Treatment includes topical agents, the same as that used in psoriasis including topical corticosteroids and emollients. Hyperkeratosis Parakeratosis Acanthosis and spongiosis (Option A) are histopathological findings commonly seen in conditions such as psoriasis and eczema, but they are not characteristic of PRP. Elongation of rete ridges (Option B) is a histological feature typically associated with psoriasis rather than PRP.

      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "Correct answer: A)Methotrexate Explanation: Methotrexate inhibit s dihydrofolate reductase, thereby disrupting folate metabolism and interfering with DNA synthesis, leading to decreased proliferation of skin cells. It also decreases the production of inflammatory cytokines eg. TNF-alpha and ILs, thereby reducing inflammation in the joints. It is currently the most recommended single agent for managing both psoriatic arthritis and skin lesions. Dosage: 7.5-25 mg/week via oral/subcutaneous route. Common side effects of methotrexate include: Gastrointestinal symptoms such as nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea. Hepatotoxicity necessitates regular monitoring of liver function tests. Bone marrow suppression leads to anemia, leukopenia, and thrombocytopenia and requires monitoring through regular blood counts. Long-term use: hepatotoxicity, pulmonary toxicity (including interstitial pneumonitis), and renal toxicity. Oral corticosteroids (Option B): They are used at times to control acute flares of psoriatic arthritis. However, they are not preferred as a single agent for managing both skin disease and arthritis, considering their potential to cause instability of cutaneous psoriasis due to reactivation after stopping. Cyclosporine (Option C): It acts by inhibiting IL-2, a key cytokine involved in immune response modulation. Often termed a \" crisis drug ,\" it is utilized to manage severe acute episodes of various immune-mediated disorders. Due to its potential for adverse effects like hyperlipidemia and hypertension, cyclosporin is not used long-term for psoriasis with psoriatic arthritis. Leflunomide (Option D) may be effective for arthritis, but it does not adequately address the skin disease aspect.",

Narrow-band UVB has a high effectiveness and tolerability compared to other UV spectra, such as broadband UVB and UVA (PUVA therapy). The mechanism of NB-UVB is cutaneous immunomodulation by Increasing vitamin D Induction of apoptosis of T cells Reduction of epidermal hyperproliferation Wavelengths of various UV spectra are given in the image below. UVA(Option A): While UVA therapy (PUVA) has been used in the treatment of psoriasis, narrow-band UVB is preferred now. PUVA therapy is associated with concerns regarding long-term side effects, including an increased risk of skin cancer. UVC (Option C) exposure can be harmful to the skin and is not indicated for therapeutic purposes in psoriasis management. UVD (Option D): \"UVD light\" is not a recognized term in the context of ultraviolet radiation. The standard terminology for ultraviolet radiation includes UVA, UVB, and UVC.

      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "Correct answer: A) Anagen Explanation: The most likely diagnosis in this patient undergoing chemotherapy is Anagen effluvium, which refers to hair shedding during the anagen or growth stage of the hair cycle. Hair goes through 3 stages in its life cycle. These stages are the Anagen phase (growth phase): 86% of hair, 3 years. Catagen phase (transition phase): 1% of hair, 3 weeks. Telogen phase (falling phase): 10-13% of hair, 3 months. Anagen effluvium: Anagen effluvium refers to hair shedding in the growth phase of the hair cycle. In this phase, the affected hairs have a cessation in their mitotic activity, causing damage to the hair shaft that results in breakage and complete hair loss if the bulb is affected. The main causes of anagen effluvium are toxic or inflammatory insults from drugs, toxins, radiation, and autoimmune diseases. Infections may interrupt hair growth, resulting in a single or several bald patches. Onset is rapid after 2–3 weeks after exposure to the cause. It is a diffuse, non-scarring type of alopecia that is completely reversible after the stoppage of cause, with a delay of 3–6 months. It requires no particular treatment. Catagen (Option B) : is incorrect because it is the transitional phase (2–3 weeks) when hair growth slows and follicular regression begins. It is not the primary target in chemotherapy-related hair loss. Telogen (Option C) : is incorrect because telogen effluvium refers to hair shedding due to premature shift into the resting phase , typically seen after stress, fever, or childbirth , not chemotherapy. Onset is delayed (2–3 months) after the insult. Exogen (Option D) : is incorrect because this is the shedding phase of telogen hairs. It is a passive process and not directly disrupted by chemotherapy agents.",

Male pattern hair loss (androgenetic alopecia) is common in men, characterized by progressive loss of terminal hairs on the scalp, influenced by genetics and hormones. It typically begins at the temples and crown, progressing with age. Dihydrotestosterone (DHT), derived from testosterone, shrinks hair follicles, reducing the anagen phase and miniaturizing hair. This leads to the transformation of thick terminal hair into finer, vellus hair. Symptoms include hair thinning and bitemporal recession of the hairline Bitemporal recession → vertex balding → Finally left with a band of hair in the occipital region because this area is androgen-independent.

Trichotillomania: It is a psychiatric disorder in which obsessive, recurrent pulling of one’s hair results in hair loss. It is seen in adolescents or young adults, more commonly in girls. Patchy hair loss with broken hair of variable lengths is seen in commonly accessible sites like the frontoparietal area of the scalp. In the Friar Tuck sign or Tonsure pattern, there is uneven hair loss in a circular pattern with surrounding hairs remaining unaffected. Perifollicular hemorrhages can also be seen because of trauma to the scalp. Skin biopsy shows empty hair follicles, with some forming soft twisted hairs described as tracheomalacia. Treatment includes cognitive behavioral therapy and antipsychotic medications like SSRI and paroxetine.

It is used to treat rheumatoid and psoriatic arthritis. Some of the most commonly implicated drugs in drug-induced LE (DILE) include: Procainamide Hydralazine Isoniazid Minocycline Quinidine Anti-TNF agents (e.g., infliximab, adalimumab) Methyldopa Propylthiouracil TNF- α inhibitors Usually, withdrawal of causative drug resolves the disease Positive anti-histone antibodie s are particularly specific for DILE Incorrect options explanation: Option b. Corticosteroids: These are the preferred first-line drugs for cutaneous lupus erythematosus due to their potent anti-inflammatory effect. They can be applied topically or administered intralesionally. Cutaneous atrophy is a common side effect of this drug, and the patient should be carefully instructed to limit the application over the skin only. Option c. Photoprotection: UV radiation is directly responsible for inducing lesions and hence, should be avoided. Sunscreens and protective clothing should be worn daily. Photoprotection also includes avoiding drugs that cause photosensitivity (e.g., Tetracyclines, Metformin, Hydrochlorothiazides, sulfonamides, etc.) Option d. Chloroquine: Antimalarial agents like chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine agents for cutaneous lupus. These drugs have an immune-modulating and photoprotective effect.
