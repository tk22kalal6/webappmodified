        "A": "Squamous Cell Carcinoma (SCC)",
        "B": "Nevus",
        "C": "Basal Cell Carcinoma (BCC)",
        "D": "Melanoma"
      },
      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "areas such as the face, particularly around the medial canthus of the eye . The classic clinical description includes: Ulceration with rolled-out, beaded margins . A pearly or translucent appearance with visible telangiectasia. Histopathology findings include: Nesting of basaloid cells . Peripheral palisading of nuclei. Clefting artifact between tumor cells and surrounding stroma. Other Options: Squamous Cell Carcinoma (SCC) (Option A) : Typically presents with a scaly, keratinized lesion that may ulcerate but lacks the rolled, pearly margins and palisading pattern seen in BCC. Nevus (Option B) : A benign lesion that does not typically ulcerate or have invasive histological features. Melanoma (Option D) : Usually presents with irregular pigmentation, asymmetry, and rapid growth , rather than a rolled-margin ulcer.

      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: B) Basal cell carcinoma Explanation: Basal cell carcinoma Aka rodent ulcer BCC is a slow-growing, locally invasive tumor and it rarely metastasizes. It arises from pluripotent cells within the basal layer of the epidermis or follicular structures. Clinical Features It presents initially small, scaly plaque Slow progressive course of peripheral extension Develops into nodular-ulcerative lesions, it has a thread-like margin, telangiectasia and it bleeds on touch. Site: Face, Around eyes, Nose Histopathology: peripheral palisading of tumour cells (shown in the image), the cells resemble cells of stratum basale that have grown into the dermis. This cluster of cells is surrounded at the periphery by perpendicularly arranged cells . It also has a well-organized stroma surrounding it. Treatment Medical: Imiquimod, 5-FU,Intralesional interferon α -2b Hedgehog pathway inhibitors:(Vismodegib) Surgical: Mohs micrographic surgery, Done in recurrent BCCs. Squamous cell carcinoma (Option A): Clinical Features: There is a presence of a papule, nodule, or plaque with induration, accompanied by signs of photodamage such as crusting and scaling. Histopathology: Keratin pearls. Melanoma (Option C): The image presented above doesn’t meet the diagnostic criteria of malignant melanoma (ABCDE) Asymmetry: Irregular shapes. Border: Irregular. Colour: Various colours present or uneven distribution. Diameter: > 6 mm. Evolution: Changes in lesion over time (size, shape, itching, or bleeding). Discoid lupus erythematosus (Option D): This is a chronic inflammatory skin condition characterized by red, scaly, and atrophic lesions, typically without a tendency to bleed. Discoid lupus has distinct features like a well-demarcated, scaly plaque, and it usually lacks the ulcerative appearance seen in this case.",

      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: C) Malignant melanoma Explanation: The image showing a lesion with irregular borders, asymmetry, and uneven distribution of colors , strongly suggests malignant melanoma . This is a malignant tumor arising from melanocytes located at the epidermal-dermal junction. Though rare, melanoma is highly aggressive with a significant risk of metastasis if not diagnosed early. Key Diagnostic Features of Malignant Melanoma ABCDE criteria : A symmetry. B order irregularity. C olor variation (brown, black, red, white, or blue). D iameter >6 mm. E volving lesion (changes in size, shape, or symptoms like bleeding or itching). Biopsy Findings: Large melanoma cells with enlarged nuclei , irregular contours, and clumped chromatin. Prominent eosinophilic nucleoli . Similar cellular appearance in both radial and vertical growth phases: Radial phase : Horizontal spread of melanoma within the epidermis and superficial dermis. Vertical phase : Deep invasion into dermal layers, forming an expansile mass. Risk Factors: Fair skin and history of sunburns . Family history or genetic mutations (e.g., CDKN2A mutation on chromosome 9p21). UV exposure and pre-existing nevi (e.g., dysplastic or congenital nevi). Types of Melanoma: Type Site Description Image Superficial spreading (M/C type) Any (more common on the upper back and, in women, lower legs) Brown mixed with bluish-red, bluish-black, reddish brown, and often whitish pink. The lesion border is often visibly and/or palpably raised Lentigo maligna Sun-exposed surfaces, particularly malar region and temple In flat portions, brown and tan predominate, but whitish grey sometimes present; in nodules, reddish brown, bluish grey, bluish-black. Acral lentiginous Palm, sole, nail bed, mucous membrane In flat portions, dark brown; in raised lesions (plaques), brown-black or blue-black. Nodular Any Reddish blue, purple, or bluish-black; can be uniform or mixed with brown and black. Staging and Classification: Breslow thickness : Measures depth of tumor invasion.

      "correct_answer": "D",
      "explanation": "commonly seen in infants. Capillary hemangiomas (strawberry hemangiomas) are benign vascular tumors that typically appear after birth, grow rapidly, and regress spontaneously . They are superficial hemangiomas composed of proliferating endothelial cells . Commonly occur on the face, scalp, trunk, or extremities . Most resolve by 5–7 years of age without treatment. Infantile Hemangioma (Capillary Hemangioma) Feature Capillary Hemangioma Cause Proliferation of immature endothelial cells Appearance Bright red, raised lesion with a well-demarcated border Onset Appears within first few weeks after birth Growth Pattern Rapid growth for months, then gradual involution Resolution 90% regress by 5–7 years of age Treatment Observation, propranolol (if complications occur) Portwine stain (Option A): Incorrect because port-wine stains (nevus flammeus) are flat, non-proliferative vascular malformations that do not regress . Cavernous hemangioma (Option B): Incorrect because cavernous hemangiomas are deeper, bluish, and less well-defined . Naevus simplex (Option C): Incorrect because naevus simplex (\"salmon patch\") is a flat, pink-red blanching lesion commonly seen on the forehead and nape of the neck .",

      "explanation": "Correct Answer:A) Melanoma Explanation: The given image showing a lesion with irregular borders , asymmetry , and uneven distribution of colors in the lesion is suggestive of malignant melanoma . Malignant melanoma: Melanoma is a malignant tumour arising from melanocytes at the epidermal-dermal junction. Though it is a rare skin cancer, it has a high mortality rate. It presents as a pigmented lesion that enlarges, ulcerates, or bleeds. Risk factors: Positive family history. Fair skin. Genetics: CDKN2A (chromosome 9p21 ), MC1R, and TYR genes. Nevus: Congenital melanocytic nevi. Junctional nevi. Atypical nevi. Dysplastic nevi. Fitzpatrick Type 1 skin. UV light. Types of Melanoma: Type Site Description Image Superficial spreading (M/C type) Any (more common on the upper back and, in women, lower legs) Brown mixed with bluish-red, bluish-black, reddish brown, and often whitish pink. The lesion border is often visibly and/or palpably raised Lentigo maligna Sun-exposed surfaces, particularly malar region and temple In flat portions, brown and tan predominate, but whitish grey sometimes present; in nodules, reddish brown, bluish grey, bluish-black. Acral lentiginous Palm, sole, nail bed, mucous membrane In flat portions, dark brown; in raised lesions (plaques), brown-black or blue-black. Nodular Any Reddish blue, purple, or bluish-black; can be uniform or mixed with brown and black. Investigations: Clinical examination. Dermoscopy. Biopsy. Immunohistochemistry: The markers are S-100, HMB-45 (the most specific), Melan-A (MART-1), and MITF. CT scan. Breslow’s and Clarke’s Classifications of Malignant Melanoma: Stage Classification Clarke Breslow I Involvement of epidermis ≤ 0.75 mm II Involvement of epidermis + dermis 0.76-1.5 mm III Involvement of dermal papillae 1.5-4 mm IV Involvement of reticular dermis >4 mm V Involvement of subcutaneous tissue - Management: Wide local excision (with margins measured before excision and determined by Breslow depth, sentinel lymph node biopsy indicated for tumours with a depth of >1.0 mm). If the tumour is aggressive: Immunotherapy. Chemotherapy. Targeted therapy. Interferon- I is the only adjuvant",

      "question": "Which type of skin cancer is commonly associated with the depicted cutaneous horn in the image?",
      "options": {
        "A": "Squamous cell carcinoma",
        "B": "Melanoma",
        "C": "BCC",
        "D": "Actinic Keratosis"
      },
      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "cutaneum, are conical or cylindrical projections that appear on the skin. They are composed of keratin, the same protein found in hair and nails. Cutaneous horns can develop on various areas of the body, but they are most commonly found on sun-exposed areas, such as the face, ears, and hands. While cutaneous horns themselves are not cancerous, they can be associated with underlying skin conditions, including squamous cell carcinoma (SCC). In fact, approximately 20% of cutaneous horns are found to be associated with SCC. The horn-like projection is often a result of the buildup of keratinized material over an underlying skin lesion, such as a precancerous actinic keratosis or an invasive SCC. The presence of a cutaneous horn should raise suspicion for an underlying malignancy, particularly SCC Incorrect Options: Option B: Melanoma - Generally being a form of skin cancer that involves the melanocytes (pigment-forming cells). These cancers are aggressive as they spread out widely. Option C: BCC - Basal cell carcinoma is a type of skin cancer that occurs from damaged DNA due to exposure to ultraviolet rays and thus leading to the carcinomatous formation in the basal cell epithelium. Option D: Actinic keratosis - Occurring in older people due to prolonged exposure to sun rays for years. In this condition, there occur rough and scaly types of skin. Thus due to long exposure to the sun, the skin becomes hard, rough, and scaly though a few of them lead to a cancerous state.",
