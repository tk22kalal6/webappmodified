      "correct_answer": "D",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: D) Lamellar ichthyosis Explanation: The image shows a newborn with a taut and glistening membrane, which suggests a diagnosis of colloidion baby , which is a feature of lamellar icthyosis. This disorder is typically inherited as an autosomal recessive disorder caused by a mutation in the TGM1 gene, which encodes the enzyme Transglutaminase 1. This enzyme plays a crucial role in the formation of the epidermal barrier, which is essential for maintaining skin integrity and preventing dehydration. The presentation includes fish-like pasted scales, ectropion, eversion of the lips (known as eclabium, resulting in a fish-mouth appearance), deformed ears, palmoplantar keratoderma, and possible nasal blockage. The scaling is generalized, notably accentuated on lower limbs and flexures. Ichthyosis vulgaris (Option A) is caused by a defect in the filaggrin gene, which results in an alteration of the skin barrier. Dry, scaly skin is present mostly on extensors, while the groin and flexors are spared. Ichthyosis is not present at birth, and it usually develops during the first months of life. It presents with very dry skin associated with atopy, hyperlinear palms, and soles; it increases in winter. X-linked",

        "D": "Endolymphatic sac tumour"
      },
      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: A) Optic nerve glioma Explanation: The brown-pigmented lesions shown in the image are café au lait macules, and the presence of pigmented nodules on the iris, known as Lisch nodules, suggests the diagnosis of Neurofibromatosis type-1(NF-1), also known as Von Recklinghausen's disease. It is an autosomal dominant neurocutaneous syndrome. The gene for NF-1 is located on chromosome 17 and encodes for neurofibromin. A diagnosis of NF-1 can be made in an individual with 2 or more of the following >/= 6 cafe au lait macules (> 5 mm in greatest dimensions for prepubertal and > 15 mm in greatest dimension post-pubertal persons) Axillary and inguinal freckles >/= 2 neurofibromas (any types) or 1 plexiform neurofibroma optic glioma >/= 2 Lisch nodules Sphenoid dysplasia, tibial pseudarthrosis, or other distinctive bone lesion First-degree relative with a diagnosis of NF-1 Malignancies associated with this syndrome are Optic nerve gliomas and astrocytoma. In NF1, optic nerve gliomas typically present in children and are often associated with specific clinical features such as café-au-lait spots (light brown skin patches), Lisch nodules (pigmented nodules in the iris), and axillary freckling (freckling in the armpits). Other characteristic features of the syndrome include Buttonhole sign: Lesions invaginate when pressed with a finger. Bag of worms: Plexiform neurofibroma has a lot of nerves which feels like a bag of worms. Renal cell carcinoma (RCC) (Option B) is a complication of Von Hippel-Lindau syndrome (the VHL gene is located on the short arm of chromosome 3). Von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) syndrome is a rare genetic disorder characterized by the development of tumours and cysts in multiple organs throughout the body. Acoustic Schwannoma (Option C) is a complication associated with neurofibromatosis type-2, caused by mutations in the NF2 gene located on chromosome 22. In NF2, acoustic schwannomas typically develop bilaterally, a hallmark",

      },
      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: A) Deficiency of type VII collagen Explanation: Epidermolysis bullosa (EB) refers to a group of rare genetic disorders characterized by fragile skin that blisters and ulcerates easily with minor friction or trauma and is also known as mechanobullous disease. Dystrophic epidermolysis bullosa is caused by mutations in the COL7A1 gene, which encodes type VII collagen resulting in Subepidermal bulla. Depending on the specific type of DEB and the inheritance pattern of the mutated gene, it can be inherited in an autosomal dominant or autosomal recessive manner. A positive family history is present. Common presenting complaints include blistering, skin fragility, and non-healing wounds disproportionate to mechanical trauma. Diagnosis is made with transmission electron microscopy, immunofluorescence antigen mapping using biopsy specimens, and genetic sequencing to confirm the subtype. Treatment mainly focuses on wound care, prevention of infection, and symptomatic management of skin and mucosal complications. The major forms of EB include: Level of skin cleavage EB type Defective protein Intraepidermal EB simplex Keratin 5 & 14 Intra lamina lucida Junctional EB Laminin 332 Sublamina densa Dystrophic EB Type VII collagen Mixed Kindler syndrome Kindlin-1",

      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: C) Incontinentia pigmenti Explanation: The clinical presentation of linear streaks of hyperpigmentation along Blaschko's lines suggests the diagnosis of Incontinentia Pigmenti, also known as Bloch-Sulzberger syndrome The condition is characterized by X-linked dominant inheritance with a mutation in the NEMO gene. It predominantly affects females while resulting in in-utero lethality in males. Presents in 4 stages: Stage I Vesicular Erythematous vesicular rash at birth Stage II Verrucous Mainly on the limbs Stage III Hyperpigmentation Hyperpigmented streaks and whorls along Blaschko’s lines Stage IV Hypopigmentation Pale, hairless, atrophic linear streaks on the lower extremities Extracutaneous features: Alopecia Dental: Peg/cone-shaped crowns Ocular: Retinal neovascularisation CNS: Microcephaly, seizures, motor impairments Treatment is typically symptomatic Hypomelanosis of Ito (Option A) is a rare genetic disorder characterized by hypopigmented streaks, patches, or whorls of skin that follow the lines of Blaschko. These manifestations can appear at birth or in early childhood. It may also be associated with neurological, musculoskeletal, and ocular abnormalities. Epidermolysis bullosa (Option D) is a group of hereditary skin disorders characterized by blister formation (bulla) in response to minor trauma or friction due to mutations affecting proteins responsible for dermal-epidermal adhesion. Subtypes vary in severity, with symptoms ranging from localized blistering to widespread involvement of skin and mucous membranes.",

      },
      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: A) Darier’s disease Explanation: The clinical presentation given in the question suggests Darier’s disease, an autosomal dominant disorder with an ATP2A2 gene defect (chromosome 12) responsible for calcium-bound ATPase type 2. Its onset is typically in childhood, exacerbated during summer and monsoon. It presents as warty, dirty, foul-smelling papules in seborrheic areas like the scalp, forehead, nasolabial folds, retro auricular region, chest, middle of the back, axillae, and groins and they are covered with a crust, causing discomfort and itching (No bulla or vesicles are observed). Nails exhibit alternate longitudinal white and red bands (erythro-leukonychia) with distal notching (V sign). Cobblestone lesions on the palate can be seen. HPE shows suprabasal acantholysis and dyskeratosis, leading to the formation of dyskeratotic cells known as Corps ronds and grains. Hailey-Hailey disease (Option B) or familial benign chronic pemphigus, is an autosomal dominant inherited acantholytic disorder caused by ATP2C1 gene mutation (chromosome 3). It is seen in adolescents, characterized by recurrent vesicular eruptions, primarily in flexures and intertriginous areas, with maceration and a chronic, exacerbating course. No mucosal involvement distinguishes it from pemphigus. Biopsy typically reveals partial suprabasal acantholysis, resembling a dilapidated brick wall appearance. Grover's disease (Option C) also known as transient acantholytic dermatosis, typically presents with sudden onset of pruritic papules predominantly on the trunk of older adults, especially in hot and humid climates. The lesions are usually erythematous and may show central clearing and histopathological examination reveals acantholysis. However, nail abnormalities such as longitudinal ridging and V-shaped notches are not characteristic of Grover's disease.",
