      "question": "A young boy came to the OPD with complaints of severe itching at night. On examination, burrows are seen over intertriginous areas, axillae, umbilicus, and between digits. Which ofthe following transmits the condition described in the scenario?",
      "options": {
        "A": "Louse",
        "B": "Tick",
        "C": "Mite",
        "D": "Flea"
      },
      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: C) Mite Explanation: The child’s symptoms of severe nocturnal itching and the presence of burrows in intertriginous areas, axillae, umbilicus, and between the fingers are characteristic of scabies, which is caused by Sarcoptes scabiei (a mite). Scabies: Parasitic infection of the skin caused by Sarcoptes scabiei (itch mite). Mode of spread: Scabies are highly contagious, and transmission is by skin-to-skin contact and fomites. Risk factors include poor personal hygiene. Clinical manifestation: The characteristic sign of scabies is the presence of burrows, Are thin, grayish-white or skin-colored, linear or wavy lines found in areas like the webbing between fingers, wrists, elbows, armpits, waistline, buttocks, genital area, and ankles, causing intense itching, especially at night. Examination typically reveals excoriated papules, typically over the web spaces of the fingers (as shown in the image). Other areas of the body that must be examined for lesions include: The medial aspect of the wrist The medial aspect of the forearm Umbilicus Axilla Nipple Genitalia/ groin- burrows (wavy, grey tunnels) This distribution is called the circle of Hebra. The face is typically spared, due to high amounts of sebum in the facial skin. Circle of Hebra demonstrating the typical location of scabies lesions Incorrect Options: Louse (Option A): Lice ( Pediculus humanus capitis, Pediculus humanus corporis, Pthirus pubis ) cause pediculosis (head/body/pubic lice) , which presents with itching and nits attached to hair shafts , not burrows in the skin. Tick (Option B): Ticks are blood-feeding arachnids that transmit diseases like Lyme disease, Rocky Mountain spotted fever, and babesiosis . They do not burrow into the skin or cause widespread itching. Flea (Option D): Fleas ( Pulex irritans ) cause pruritic papules , often in a clustered pattern (\"breakfast, lunch, and dinner\" sign) , but they do not form burrows in the skin.",

      "question": "The involvement of which of the following results in the given condition below?",
      "options": {
        "A": "Arteries",
        "B": "Vein",
        "C": "Lymphatics",
        "D": "DVT"
      },
      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "parasitic worms, specifically Wuchereria bancrofti, Brugia malayi, and Brugia timori. These worms primarily inhabit the lymphatic system, causing inflammation and obstruction of lymphatic vessels. This leads to the clinical manifestations of filariasis, such as lymphedema (swelling), elephantiasis (severe swelling), and other related complications. Incorrect Options: Option A- Arteries: Arteries are blood vessels that carry oxygenated blood away from the heart to various parts of the body. They do not play a direct role in filariasis. Filariasis is a parasitic infection caused by thread-like filarial worms, typically transmitted through mosquito bites. The worms primarily affect the lymphatic system, not the arteries. Option B - Vein: Veins are blood vessels that carry deoxygenated blood back to the heart. Similar to arteries, veins do not have a direct role in filariasis. The infection mainly targets the lymphatic system, leading to the characteristic swelling of body parts due to impaired lymph flow. Option D - DVT (Deep Vein Thrombosis): DVT is a condition where a blood clot forms in a deep vein, usually in the legs. While DVT involves veins, it is unrelated to filariasis. DVT results from the formation of blood clots within veins, often due to factors like prolonged immobility, certain medical conditions, or genetic predisposition.",

        "C": "Elephantiasis",
        "D": "Leishmaniasis"
      },
      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: C) Elephantiasis Explanation: Elephantiasis is a condition characterized by massive swelling and thickening of the skin and underlying tissues, most commonly affecting the limbs and genitalia. It results from lymphatic obstruction, leading to chronic lymphedema and progressive fibrosis. Elephantiasis: Cause: Delayed sequel of repeated lymphangitis, obstruction, and lymphedema. Pathophysiology: Persistent lymph leakage into tissues → chronic lymphedema → elephantiasis. Clinical Features: Nonpitting brawny edema (firm swelling). Thickened skin, cracks, and fissures. Growth of new adventitious tissue. Increased risk of secondary bacterial and fungal infections. Commonly Affected Areas: Legs (most common), but other body parts can also be involved. Causes of Elephantiasis: Lymphatic Filariasis (most common cause) Caused by parasitic nematodes like Wuchereria bancrofti , Brugia malayi , and Brugia timori Transmitted by mosquito bites Leads to chronic lymphatic obstruction and severe swelling Non-Filarial Elephantiasis (Podoconiosis) Caused by chronic exposure to volcanic soil with high silica content Seen in tropical regions like Africa and South America Other Causes:",
