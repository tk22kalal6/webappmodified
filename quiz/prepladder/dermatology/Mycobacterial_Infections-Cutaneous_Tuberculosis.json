      "question": "A 35-year-old construction worker presents with a painless lesion on his right forearm following sustaining a minor abrasion while working with bricks a few weeks ago. Physical examination reveals a shallow ulcer with undermined edges. Acid-fast bacilli staining of a biopsy specimen from the lesion is positive. Which of the following types of cutaneous tuberculosis is most likely responsible for this presentation?",
      "options": {
        "A": "Exogenous with previous exposure to MTB",
        "B": "Exogenous with no previous exposure to MTB",

      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "scenario suggests Tuberculosis chancre, a multibacillary, exogenous cutaneous TB that occurs in individuals with no previous sensitization to TB. It presents with an ulcer with undermined edges and is analogous to Ghonâ€™s focus on pulmonary TB. Cutaneous TB is classified into three categories: Exogenous: The source of TB is outside the body. It is further divided into two types based on previous exposure to MTB. Tuberculosis chancre Tuberculosis verrucosa cutis No previous exposure to MTB No immunity present Multibacillary Previous exposure to MTB Strong immunity is present Paucibacillary Endogenous: The source of TB is inside the body Tuberculids: Cutaneous hypersensitivity response to mycobacteria Exogenous with previous exposure to MTB (Option A): Tuberculosis verrucosa cutis, a paucibacillary exogenous cutaneous TB, occurs in previously sensitised individuals with strong immunity; hence it is not the correct option for the given condition. It presents as a painless, slowly progressive, red or brown warty, hyperkeratotic plaque with a verrucous or papillomatous surface. Endogenous cutaneous TB (Option C): The source of the given clinical condition is exogenous, not endogenous. Endogenous cutaneous TB is classified into three categories based on its mode of spread. Contiguous Autoinoculation Hematogenous Scrofuloderma: Endogenous spread from the cervical lymph node. Multibacillary. Most common in children but occur in all age groups. Periorificial TB: It is a multibacillary lesion. This is due to the bacterium being directly inoculated into the skin through minor trauma or breaks in the skin around the orifices. Lupus vulgaris: Paucibacillary. Presents as reddish-brown papules, nodules, or plaques on the skin. TB Gumma: Multibacillary Presents as painless, indurated subcutaneous nodules or abscesses. Tuberculids IIIIIII (Option D): These are cutaneous hypersensitivity reactions to mycobacterium tuberculosis due to hematogenous spread, not exogenous sources. Examples include Lichen scrofulosorum (Micropapular) Papulonecrotic tuberculid (Papular) Erythema Induratum of Bazin (Nodular)",

      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: B) Post-primary tuberculosis with poor immunity. Explanation: The given clinical scenario and the image suggest the diagnosis of Tuberculosis verrucous cutis which is also known as Prosecutor's wart, Anatomist's wart (Option A) , Verruca necrogenica, and Warty tuberculosis. It is a form of Cutaneous tuberculosis that occurs after direct inoculation of the mycobacteria into the skin of a previously sensitized host with good immunity against the bacillus. (Option B) It is a paucibacillary lesion (Option C) , and inoculation typically occurs from an exogenous source. In adults, TBVC most frequently develops on the acral extremities; the fingers and dorsum of the hands are commonly affected, while in children, the ankles or buttocks are frequent sites for lesion occurrence. It presents as a painless, slowly progressive, red or brown warty, hyperkeratotic plaque with a verrucous or papillomatous surface and it grows via peripheral extension. On histopathological examination, it is",

These lesions usually appear as well-defined, erythematous to reddish-brown plaques or nodules with smooth, slightly scaly, or verrucous surfaces and may have active, raised margins.

Lupus vulgaris is the most common form of cutaneous TB seen in adults (Most common in females). Causative organisms: Mycobacterium tuberculosis, Mycobacterium bovis. Pathogenesis : Route of spread: Endogenous spread or from exogenous inoculation. It occurs in a previously sensitized individual with an increased cell-mediated immunity to tuberculin.

      },
      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: A) Commonly seen in adults Explanation: Based on the clinical history and image, the diagnosis points to Lichen scrofulosorum , a rare form of tuberculid (Option C) , commonly seen in children (not in adults). Fig. Lichen Scrofulosorum showing annular and plaque I like lesions with strong tuberculin reaction Lichenoid variety of Lichen Scrofulosorum Lichen scrofulosorum presents with asymptomatic, lichenoid-grouped papules, often perifollicular in distribution. (Option D) The trunk is the most common site for these lesions. (Option B) Healing typically occurs without scarring. Positive Mantoux test indicates previous exposure to tuberculosis antigens. Biopsy reveals superficial dermal granulomas surrounding hair follicles. These granulomas contain epithelioid cells, lymphocytes, and occasional giant cells, typically without caseation. Treatment involves a course of antitubercular therapy: 2 months of HRZE followed by 4 months of HRE.",

      "correct_answer": "D",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: D) Rifampicin Explanation: The clinical picture shows an erythematous plaque with central scarring and an advancing edge, which suggests a clinical diagnosis of Lupus vulgaris. Rifampicin is an antibiotic that is part of the standard Anti-Tuberculous Therapy (ATT), started in this patient. It is used in combination with other medications, such as Isoniazid, Pyrazinamide, and Ethambutol, to treat cutaneous tuberculosis, such as lupus vulgaris. Amphotericin B (Option A): Amphotericin B is an antifungal medication used for serious systemic fungal infections caused by Candida species, Aspergillus species, Cryptococcus neoformans, Histoplasma capsulatum, and other fungi. It is not indicated in the treatment of cutaneous tuberculosis. Itraconazole (Option B): Itraconazole is an antifungal agent that is commonly used for fungal infections of the skin like dermatophytosis. It would not be effective in treatment against mycobacterium tuberculosis. Minocycline (Option D) : It is a tetracycline antibiotic with anti-inflammatory properties often used for acne-vulgaris.

        "D": "Diabetic ulcer"
      },
      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: A) Buruli ulcer Explanation: It is caused by Mycobacterium ulcerans , which is endemic to wetland areas. It presents as a painless ulcer with necrosis and undermined edges. Necrosis is due to a cytotoxin, Myolactone, released by the organism I Acid-fast bacilli in a smear from the lesion support the diagnosis. The four main diagnostic laboratory tests for Buruli ulcer are direct smear (with acid I fast stains, auramine O or Ziehlâ€“Neelsen), culture at 32Â°C, histopathology (lympho-epithelioid cell proliferation and panniculitis with characteristic fat necrotic changes), PCR (highest sensitivity). Treatment: Small ulcers(<5cm) Rifampicin + Clarithromycin/Streptomycin for 8 weeks Large ulcers (>5cm) Surgery is recommended along with antibiotic therapy. Cutaneous Tuberculosis (Option B) : Although cutaneous tuberculosis is caused by an acid-fast bacillus (Mycobacterium tuberculosis), it typically presents in areas with a high prevalence of tuberculosis. Cutaneous Leishmaniasis (Option C): Cutaneous leishmaniasis causes skin ulcers, but these are typically painful",
