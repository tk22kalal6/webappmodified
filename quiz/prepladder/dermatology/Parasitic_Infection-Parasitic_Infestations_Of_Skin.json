      },
      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: A) Face Explanation: The likely diagnosis of this case is scabies, a parasitic infection of the skin caused by Sarcoptes scabiei (itch mite). Mode of spread: Scabies are highly contagious, and transmission is by skin-to-skin contact and fomites. Risk factors include poor personal hygiene. Clinical manifestation: The characteristic sign of scabies is the presence of burrows, Are thin, grayish-white or skin-colored, linear or wavy lines found in areas like the webbing between fingers, wrists, elbows, armpits, waistline, buttocks, genital area, and ankles, causing intense itching, especially at night. Examination typically",

      "question": "A 10-year-old boy is diagnosed with scabies after presenting with severe itching lesions, predominantly over his wrists and hands. What is the first-line treatment for his condition?",
      "options": {
        "A": "5 % Permethrin",
        "B": "Gamma benzene hexachloride (GBHC)",
        "C": "Precipitated sulfur",
        "D": "Ivermectin"
      },
      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: A) 5% Permethrin Explanation: 5% Permethrin is the drug of choice for scabies. It is given in addition to general measures: Anti-histamines for pruritus Wash clothes, and bedding with hot water Examine and treat family members MOA: Blocks sodium channels of the itch mite, causing paralysis. Application: Apply below the neck for 8-12 hours at a time (overnight); it is typically applied twice, one week apart. It is safe and can be used in all patients older than 2 months. 1% Permethrinis used for pediculosis GBHC (option B): An older chloride-channel blocker that is rarely used. It is also not safe in pregnancy, in those with neurologic disorders, and in children. Precipitated sulfur (option C) : While safe and effective, this is not the first choice, as its odour can make it unpleasant to use, But can be used in infants <2 months old. Ivermectin (option D): Given orally (200mc/kg—two doses). It is typically reserved for patients with scabies who do not respond to permethrin, atypical scabies, and those who cannot comply with or tolerate topical alternatives. Briefly, other drugs include- Crotamiton (not safe in children), Malathion, Benzyl Benzoate, and Lindane (not safe in children, pregnancy).

        "D": "Topical steroids"
      },
      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: C) Ivermectin + Permethrin Explanation: This patient likely has crusted scabies or Norwegian scabies (NS). This is a severe form of scabies due to massive infestation of the itch mite. Risk factors include: Immunocompromise (HIV, malignancy, etc) Old age Neurologic disease NS is characterized by large, hyperkeratotic plaques that may cover up to 90% of the body's surface. Due to diminished immunity, pruritus is typically absent, contributing to the accumulation of crusts. These crusts can contain millions of mites and their eggs. Treatment involves both oral ivermectin and topical permethrin. Additionally, a keratolytic agent may be used to help the penetration of permethrin. Topical steroids (Option D): Topical steroids are the treatment of choice for nodular scabies, a special form of scabies caused by a hypersensitivity response to the mites. The lesions are typically pruritic, with firm nodules/ papules over the axilla and groin. Nodules in the axilla of a patient with nodular scabies",

      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: B) Sarcoptes scabiei Explanation: The given clinical scenario describes infantile scabies. Infantile scabies are similar to adult scabies, except that there is more extensive involvement, including the face, palms, and soles. Examination reveals erythematous papules with burrows. Lesions may even be vesicular or bullous due to greater inflammatory response in children. Skin scraping and microscopic examination of the epidermis from the affected sites establish the diagnosis of scabies. KOH may be used to dissolve keratin debris. Microscopic evaluation will reveal mites, eggs, and feces. Mite with eggs Phthirus pubis (Option A) – Causes pubic lice (crab louse infestation), primarily affecting pubic hair, not associated with burrows or extensive infantile involvement. C. Trichophyton (Option C) – A dermatophyte fungus responsible for tinea infections (e.g., ringworm), which presents with scaly patches rather than burrows or vesicles. Staphylococcus aureus (Option D) – Can cause impetigo and bullous skin infections but does not produce burrows, mites, or microscopic eggs in skin scrapings.",

      "explanation": "Correct Answer: B) Ancylostoma caninum Explanation: The given case scenario describes cutaneous larva migrans. This is caused by animal hookworm larvae (Ancylostoma braziliensis/ caninum) and typically occurs due to walking barefoot on contaminated sand or soil. It classically begins with a pruritic, erythematous papule at the site of penetration, followed by intensely pruritic, serpiginous, reddish-brown skin tracks, along the path of migration of the larvae. These develop slowly over days (1-2 cm/day) The larvae cannot penetrate beyond the dermis, so systemic manifestations are uncommon. Treatment involves oral ivermectin. Loa loa (Option A) is",

      },
      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: A) Sleeping sickness Explanation: American trypanosomiasis: The given image shows Romana's sign, i.e., a swollen nodule or ‘ chagoma ’ at the site of infection, most commonly over the eyelids or near the mouth. This is an early sign of Trypanosoma cruzei infection, which is endemic to South America and is therefore called American trypanosomiasis. Trypanosoma cruzei is transmitted via the bite of the Reduviid bug , or kissing bug (named so because the bite is painless). Early symptoms are non-specific and include fever, lymphadenopathy, and the Romana sign. If untreated, it can lead to Chaga’s disease, the manifestations of which include Dilated cardiomyopathy - heart failure (option B) , arrhythmias, sudden cardiac death. Megaesophagus and megacolon (options C and D) - due to autonomic nerve destruction. Diagnosis of acute disease is by demonstration of T cruzi trypomastigote on blood smears. Treatment of acute disease involves Nifurtimox or Benznidazole. Chaga’s disease is incurable and requires supportive care as appropriate. Sleeping sickness: This is caused by T. brucei (rhodesiense or gambiense). It is endemic to rural Africa and is transmitted by the tse tse fly. It is also known as African trypanosomiasis. Early infection is non-specific, with fever, cervical lymphadenopathy ( Winterbottom’s sign: posterior cervical triangle lymphadenopathy), Kerandl sign (delayed pain after a sharp blow or squeeze to soft tissue) and arthralgia, which lasts for varying lengths of time. Late infection is characterized by neuropsychiatric manifestations, with sleep-wake cycle disturbance prominent.",

        "D": "Leishmania donovani"
      },
      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: C) Leishmania major Explanation: This case describes Old World Cutaneous Leishmaniasis (CL) in a soldier recently deployed to Iraq , a region endemic for Leishmania major . The clinical features (painless ulcerated plaque with crusting and lymphadenopathy) are classic for cutaneous leishmaniasis . Leishmaniasis is a vector-borne disease caused by protozoa of the genus Leishmania , transmitted by female sand flies ( Phlebotomus in the Old World). The clinical spectrum ranges from cutaneous ulcers to systemic multiorgan disease (visceral leishmaniasis). Cutaneous Leishmaniasis (CL): Type Region Species Clinical Features Old World CL Middle East, Africa, Asia L. major , L. tropica Painless papule → nodule/plaque → ulcer , often with crusting and raised volcano-like margins New World CL Central and South America L. mexicana , L. braziliensis Similar lesions; L. mexicana causes Chiclero's ulcer (chronic ulcers on the ear due to multiple bites) New World CL: The ulcer may be covered with thick white-yellow fibrinous material. ‘Chiclero’s ulcer’ - multiple, small, chronic ulcers on the ear, due to multiple sandfly bites. Mucocutaneous Leishmaniasis (ML): Caused by L. braziliensis (Option B) . Involves mucosal destruction of the nasal septum, mouth, and throat . Features include nasal congestion, bleeding, pain, and eventual disfigurement . Visceral Leishmaniasis (Kala-azar): Caused by Leishmania donovani (Option D). Presents with fever, weight loss, hepatosplenomegaly, and pancytopenia . No cutaneous lesions are typical.",
