      "question": "What skin condition is characterized by the presence of coral red fluorescence under a woods lamp?",
      "options": {
        "A": "Erythrasma",
        "B": "Acanthosis nigricans",
        "C": "Allergic contact dermatitis",
        "D": "Cutaneous candidiasis"
      },
      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: A) Erythrasma Explanation: Erythrasma is a superficial bacterial infection caused by Corynebacterium minutissimum. It commonly affects intertriginous areas (groin, axillae, inframammary folds, and toe webs) and presents as well-defined, reddish-brown patches with mild scaling. A key diagnostic feature is its coral red fluorescence under a Wood's lamp, which occurs due to protoporphyrin production by Corynebacterium minutissimum. Erythrasma: Erythrasma is a superficial skin infection caused by Corynebacterium minutissimum. Risk factors include diabetes mellitus, obesity, immunocompromised state, hyperhidrosis, older adults It usually presents as asymptomatic lesions in the following areas: Interdigital: Scaling, fissuring plaques, maceration Intertriginous: Hyperpigmented patches, mild scaling, wrinkling Genital/perianal: Pruritis ani Interdigital erythrasma commonly occurs with dermatophyte or candidal infections Wood's lamp examination shows coral-red fluorescence from coproporphyrin III produced by Corynebacterium minutissimum. Treatment: First line: Topical antibacterials (Fusidic acid, Clarithromycin) or topical antifungal (Miconazole) Second line: Photodynamic therapy using porphyrin Wood's lamp examination is a diagnostic procedure used to observe fluorescence patterns in the skin under ultraviolet light. It helps identify fungal infections, bacterial infections, pigmentary disorders, and other skin conditions based on characteristic fluorescence reactions This",

      "question": "A 45-year-old patient presents with a facial appearance that is marked by thickened, coarse, and deeply furrowed skin. The skin appears to be involved in the cheeks, forehead, and nose. The patient complains of numbness and weakness in the extremities. On examination, there are hypopigmented and erythematous patches with loss of sensation. What is the medical condition characterized by the term “Leonine facies”?",
      "options": {
        "A": "Lepromatous Leprosy",
        "B": "Acromegaly",
        "C": "Myasthenia gravis",
        "D": "Bells palsy"
      },
      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "appearance that can be seen in patients with advanced lepromatous leprosy. Lepromatous leprosy is a severe form of leprosy caused by the bacterium Mycobacterium leprae. It is characterized by the infiltration of the skin and other tissues by large numbers of bacilli, leading to significant tissue damage and deformities. The term \"leonine\" refers to the resemblance of the patient's facial features to those of a lion, with thickened, coarse, deeply furrowed skin. In addition to the distinct facial appearance, lepromatous leprosy can lead to peripheral nerve damage, resulting in sensory loss, muscle weakness, and other neurological symptoms. The hypopigmented and erythematous patches with loss of sensation mentioned in the patient's presentation are also characteristic of leprosy. Incorrect Options: Option B - Acromegaly: Acromegaly is a condition caused by the excessive production of growth hormone after the growth plates have closed. It leads to the enlargement of bones and tissues, resulting in enlarged hands, feet, facial features, and other body parts. While acromegaly can cause changes in facial appearance, it does not typically result in the specific \"leonine facies\" described in the question. Option C - Myasthenia Gravis: Myasthenia gravis is an autoimmune neuromuscular disorder characterized by muscle weakness and fatigue, particularly in the muscles that control eye and eyelid movements, facial expression, chewing, and swallowing. It does not cause the thickened, coarse, and deeply furrowed skin seen in \"leonine facies.\" Option D - Bell's Palsy: Bell's palsy is a condition characterized by sudden weakness or paralysis of the muscles on one side of the face due to inflammation of the facial nerve. It can lead to drooping of the affected side of the face and difficulty in facial expressions, but it does not cause the specific skin changes described as \"leonine facies.\"",

      "question": "What is the treatment of choice for a patient with paronychia, as shown in the image below?",
      "options": {
        "A": "Amoxiclav",
        "B": "Metronidazole",
        "C": "Amikacin",
        "D": "Norfloxacin"
      },
      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: A) Amoxiclav Explanation: Clinical Presentation: The image shows paronychia , an infection around the nail fold, characterized by redness, swelling, pain, and pus collection . Most Common Cause: Acute paronychia : Staphylococcus aureus (most common), Streptococcus species. Chronic paronychia : Candida species. First-line Antibiotic: Amoxicillin-clavulanate (Amoxiclav) covers Staphylococcus aureus , Streptococcus , and anaerobes , making it the best choice. Paronychia Management Feature Acute Paronychia Chronic Paronychia Cause Bacterial (Staph aureus, Streptococci) Fungal (Candida) Onset Rapid, painful swelling Gradual, less painful Pus Formation Yes, common Rare Treatment Drainage + Amoxiclav Antifungals (topical clotrimazole) Metronidazole (Option B): Incorrect because it mainly covers anaerobes and protozoa , which are not the primary cause of paronychia. Amikacin (Option C): Incorrect because it mainly targets Gram-negative bacteria , while paronychia is mostly due to Gram-positive organisms (Staph aureus, Streptococci) . Norfloxacin (Option D): Incorrect because it is a fluoroquinolone with poor Staph aureus coverage , making it ineffective.",

      "question": "Which of the following organisms is most likely to be the cause of the leg lesion shown in the image below, as presented by a young man? The lesions exhibit pain, well-defined raised edges, and the patient also reports blisters on his body. Furthermore, the patient is in good health with no co-existing medical conditions.",
      "options": {
        "A": "Group B streptococcus",
        "B": "Group A streptococcus",
        "C": "Staphylococcus aureus",
        "D": "Haemophilus influenza type B"
      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer B- Group A streptococcus Explanation: From the presentation—a painful, sharply demarcated, raised-edged leg lesion (likely erysipelas) with blister formation in an otherwise healthy young individual—the most common causative organism is Group A Streptococcus (Streptococcus pyogenes). Erysipelas: Erysipelas is a skin infection that usually affects the upper half of the dermis but may also extend to the superficial cutaneous lymphatics. It occurs due to the entry of bacteria through a breach in the skin barrier. Erysipelas is most commonly caused by beta-hemolytic streptococci. Clinical features: It manifests as an area of erythema that is well-demarcated and raised around the edges. Acute onset constitutional symptoms like fever, chills and malaise are also present Milian's ear sign: Involvement of ear is characteristic of erysipelas as the ear does not have a deeper dermis layer Milian's ear sign is a distinguishing feature of erysipelas. Treatment: First line: Flucloxacillin/ Clarithromycin Second line: Roxithromycin Prophylaxis for recurrent infections: Long-term",
