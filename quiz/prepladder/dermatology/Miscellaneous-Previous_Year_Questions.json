      "explanation": "Correct Answer: A) Vit B3 Explanation: The patient is a chronic alcoholic with a pruritic, eczematous rash on the neck and dorsum of the hands, which is characteristic of pellagra—a disease caused by niacin (Vitamin B3) deficiency. Pellagra is characterized by the classic triad of symptoms: Dermatitis Bright red erythema- in sun-exposed areas (face, ankles, feet) Casal’s necklace - ↑ pigmentation around the neck Diarrhoea, and Dementia. Causes of pellagra : Dietary Deficiency- Maize and Sorghum based diet Impaired Tryptophan Metabolism Factors Affecting Tryptophan to Niacin Conversion: Vitamin B6 Deficiency Medications: Isoniazid (INH), OCPs Hormonal Influences: Estrogen metabolites hinder tryptophan metabolism. Genetic Disorders: Inherited conditions like Hartnup disease can impede tryptophan absorption in the intestines and reabsorption in the kidneys Carcinoid Syndrome Other Contributing Factors: Alcoholism: Interferes with nutrient absorption, including niacin and tryptophan. Malabsorption Syndromes Incorrect Options: Vitamin B1 (Thiamine) Deficiency (Option B): Leads to Beriberi (wet/dry) and Wernicke-Korsakoff syndrome , which primarily causes neurological and cardiac symptoms rather than a rash. Vitamin D Deficiency (Option C): Causes rickets in children and osteomalacia in adults , presenting with bone pain and muscle weakness , but no skin rash. Vitamin C Deficiency (Option D): Leads to scurvy , characterized by bleeding gums, petechiae, impaired wound healing , and corkscrew hairs, but not the photosensitive rash seen in pellagra.",

      },
      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: A) Vitamin A Explanation: Follicular hyperkeratosis is characterized by dry, rough skin with small, keratotic papules around hair follicles, often seen in Vitamin A deficiency. This occurs due to abnormal keratinization of epithelial cells. Vitamin A Deficiency Manifestations : 1) Ocular manifestations : Vitamin A deficiency is the most significant preventable cause of blindness, especially in children below 5 in developing countries. Early Signs: Loss of sensitivity to green light. Difficulty adapting to dim light. Night blindness. Prolonged Deficiency: Xerophthalmia: Dry, thick, keratinized conjunctiva and cornea. If untreated, it leads to corneal ulceration and ultimately results in blindness due to the formation of opaque scar tissue. WHO grading of xerophthalmia: XN Night blindness. X1 X1A: Conjunctival xerosis. X1B: Bitot spots. X2 Corneal xerosis. X3 X3A: Corneal ulceration, less than one-third. X3B: Corneal ulceration, more than one-third. XS Corneal scar. XF Xerophthalmic fundus. Bitot's Spots: Grayish-white triangular plaques firmly adherent to the conjunctiva. Keratomalacia: When xerophthalmia persists for a longer time, it progresses to keratomalacia (corneal softening). 2) Immune Function: Deficiency increases susceptibility to infections. Infection reduces retinol-binding protein synthesis, lowering vitamin A levels and impairing immune responses. 3) Skin and Mucous Membrane Lesions: Follicular Hyperkeratosis (Phrynoderma): Causes rough skin due to hyperkeratinization of the follicular epithelium. Keratinizing Metaplasia: Affects respiratory, gastrointestinal, and genitourinary tracts. Epithelium is atrophied. 4) Other General Manifestation : Growth retardation due to defective synthesis of chondroitin sulfate. Decreased protein synthesis. Incorrect Options: Vitamin C Deficiency (Option B): Causes scurvy, leading to corkscrew hairs, perifollicular hemorrhages, and poor wound healing, but not follicular hyperkeratosis. Vitamin E Deficiency (Option C): Causes neurological symptoms (ataxia, peripheral neuropathy, hemolytic anemia) but does not affect keratinization. Vitamin B6 Deficiency (Option D): Leads to cheilitis, glossitis, irritability, and neuropathy, but not follicular hyperkeratosis.

      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: B) Bleomycin Explanation: Flagellate dermatitis, also known as \"flagellate erythema,\" is a distinctive skin reaction that can occur as a side effect of certain medications. Among the given options, the most commonly associated drug with flagellate dermatitis is Bleomycin, which is an antineoplastic medication used in the treatment of various cancers. Flagellate dermatitis typically appears as linear or streak-like red or brownish patches on the skin, resembling the marks left by a whip or a scratch. It usually occurs on the trunk, extremities, or face and is believed to be an idiosyncratic reaction to Bleomycin. Bleomycin-induced flagellate dermatitis is thought to be related to the drug's ability to induce the release of inflammatory mediators, resulting in the characteristic skin reaction. It typically occurs within a few days to weeks after the administration of Bleomycin and tends to resolve spontaneously once the drug is discontinued. Some common side effects associated with the use of Bleomycin: Side Effect Description Pulmonary Toxicity Bleomycin is known to cause lung damage, which can lead to pulmonary fibrosis and respiratory symptoms such as cough, shortness of breath, and decreased lung function. Skin Toxicity Bleomycin can cause skin reactions, including flagellate dermatitis (linear streaks on the skin), erythema (redness), and skin desquamation (peeling). Mucosal Toxicity Bleomycin can cause mucosal damage, resulting in mouth sores, sore throat, and inflammation of the oral and nasal mucosa. Fever Fever is a common side effect of Bleomycin treatment and can occur shortly after administration.",

        "D": "Drug-induced hyper melanosis"
      },
      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: C) Fixed drug eruption Explanation: The recurrent nature of the rash in the same location after taking NSAIDs strongly supports Fixed Drug Eruption (FDE). Fixed drug eruption: Fixed drug eruption is a distinctive cutaneous allergic reaction that characteristically recurs at the same sites with the same morphology on re-exposure to the medication or other chemical agent. Type 4 hypersensitivity reaction (Option B ruled out) Causative drugs: Co-trimoxazole, NSAIDs, tetracyclines, sulfonamides. Mediated by memory T-cells. Acutely, erythematous and bullous phases of fixed eruptions, followed by well-circumscribed areas of slate-brown pigmentation Site of lesions: Mucous membrane (Lips, tongues, Glans penis), face and acral areas although can occur anywhere on the skin surface. Leaves residual hyperpigmentation on healing (Option A ruled out). Upon reexposure, lesions develop within 30 minutes to 8 hours (Option C ruled out). Treatment: Stop the causative drug. Topical steroids and antibiotics combinations Incorrect Options Drug hypersensitivity (Option A): While this is a broad term for adverse drug reactions, it doesn't specify the unique characteristic of recurrence at the same site.",

      },
      "correct_answer": "D",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: D) Implantation dermoid Explanation: An implantation dermoid is a type of dermoid cyst that occurs due to the accidental implantation of epidermal cells into the deeper tissues following trauma, such as thorn pricks, puncture wounds, or surgical procedures. Dermoid Cyst: Pathophysiology: Formed when epithelial tissue is trapped along the lines of embryonic fusion. Common Sites: Outer canthus of the eye Post-auricular region Clinical Features: Cystic swelling (Fluctuation test positive) Skin can be pinched over the swelling Investigations: X-ray/CT must be done to rule out intracranial extension before surgery Management: Surgical excision Implantation Dermoid: Occurs due to injury Most common after ear piercing Management: Surgical excision Ameloblastoma (Option A): is a benign odontogenic tumor generally present in the jawbone. Embryogenic dermoid (Option B): A dermoid cyst is a benign cutaneous developmental anomaly that arises from the entrapment of ectodermal elements along the lines of embryonic closure. Sequestration dermoid (Option C): Dermoid cysts result from an abnormal alteration in fetal development. They occur due to the abnormal sequestration and inclusion of the surface ectoderm along the lines of skin fusion during embryologic development.

      "explanation": "Correct Answer: B) Xeroderma pigmentosum Explanation: The correct answer is Xeroderma pigmentosum, as the girl has severe sunburns with minimal exposure, freckling, and sun-induced skin damage, which are hallmark features of XP. Xeroderma Pigmentosum: It is a rare autosomal recessive disorder characterized by extreme sensitivity to ultraviolet (UV) radiation from sunlight. It arises due to genetic mutations affecting genes responsible for the nucleotide excision repair (NER) pathway. It presents with freckle-like pigmented patches, atrophic areas, and other skin abnormalities in sun-exposed areas. Additionally, patients may experience ocular manifestations such as photophobia, conjunctival injection, and corneal ulcers due to UV-induced damage. Systemic manifestations can include mental retardation and low intelligence. Increased risk of developing skin cancers, including melanoma, squamous cell carcinoma, and basal cell carcinoma, at a young age. Bloom Syndrome (Option A): It is a rare autosomal recessive genetic disorder caused by mutations in the BLM gene. It presents with short stature, photosensitivity, and characteristic facial features including a long, narrow face and prominent nose, along with other physical anomalies such as micrognathia and cafe-au-lait spots.",
