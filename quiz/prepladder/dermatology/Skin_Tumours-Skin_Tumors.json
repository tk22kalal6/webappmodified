      "explanation": "lesion with irregular borders , asymmetry , and uneven distribution of colors in the lesion is suggestive of malignant melanoma . The gold standard investigation for diagnosis of melanoma is histopathological examination by a biopsy. Biopsy findings in malignant melanoma: Individual melanoma cells are usually larger than normal melanocytes or cells found in melanocytic nevi. They have enlarged nuclei with irregular contours , chromatin that is characteristically clumped at the periphery of the nuclear membrane, and prominent red (eosinophilic) nucleoli. The appearance of the tumour cells is similar in the radial and vertical phases of growth. Radial growth phase: Horizontal spread of melanoma within the epidermis & superficial dermis. Vertical growth phase: Tumor cells",

      "explanation": "Correct answer: D) Erythema chronicum migrans Explanation: Erythema chronicum migrans (ECM) is not typically a marker of internal malignancy. It is the characteristic rash of early Lyme disease , caused by the tick-borne spirochete Borrelia burgdorferi . Erythema chronicum migrans (ECM): Occurs in about 90% of patients at the site of the tick bite . Appears 1–36 days after the bite (average: 9 days). Results from local spread of the spirochete , forming a ring-shaped lesion that enlarges at a rate of several centimeters per week . May be: Intensely erythematous or barely noticeable Flat or elevated at the center , periphery , or both Occasionally accompanied by slight scaling Target-like morphology may appear due to central clearing. Moderate burning or itching occurs in about one-third of cases. Without treatment, the lesion fades within a few weeks (range: 1 day to 14 months). Associated features may include regional lymphadenopathy and mild systemic symptoms . Necrolytic migratory erythema (Option A): Associated with : Glucagonoma (a rare pancreatic islet cell tumor). Clinical features: Extremely erythematous plaques Superficial epidermal necrosis Centrifugal spread Correctly associated with internal malignancy. Acanthosis nigricans (Option B): Can be a cutaneous marker of internal malignancy, most commonly gastric adenocarcinoma .

The incorrect statement is that it has a high potential for invasive malignancy. Bowen's disease/Squamous cell carcinoma in situ: It is an intra-epidermal squamous cell carcinoma characterized by a persistent, non-elevated, red, scaly, or crusted plaque with a low potential for invasive malignancy. Risk factors: Arsenic exposure. Immunosuppression (organ transplant, HIV). Chronic lymphocytic leukemia. Human papilloma virus- HPV16 and HPV18 are commonly found in Bowen disease lesions, especially in anogenital areas. It usually grows progressively but sometimes undergoes spontaneous partial resolution. It can occur anywhere, but more in the head and neck region. Pathology: Full-thickness epidermal dysplasia & disordered differentiation with loss of epithelial polarity. The intraepidermal portion of cutaneous adnexae is generally affected. Parakeratosis and acanthosis are usually present, and keratinocytes show variable pleomorphism, nuclear hyperchromasia, and nuclear enlargement. The dermal-epidermal junction remains distinct .

      "explanation": "Correct answer: C) Cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma Cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma (SCC): SCC is a malignant tumour originating from epidermal keratinocytes, the second most common skin tumour after basal cell carcinoma (BCC). SCC is notably the most common skin tumour in immunocompromised individuals. Associated with immunocompromised states such as HIV infection and renal transplant recipients, SCC typically exhibits a lower rate of local, regional, and distant spread compared to other skin malignancies. Predisposing factors include UV exposure, immunosuppression, and conditions like xeroderma pigmentosum, albinism, LP, and DLE, which can rarely progress into SCC. Commonly presents as papules, nodules, or plaques with induration and signs of photo-damage like crusting and scaling. Histopathological examination reveals characteristic keratin pearls. Treatment: Primary treatment involves wide surgical excision with margins. Mohs micrographic surgery (MMS) aids in intraoperative histopathological examination. Advanced cases may require radiation or chemotherapy. Actinic keratosis (Option A) Actinic keratosis typically presents as rough, scaly, erythematous macules or papules on sun-exposed areas. Histologically, it is characterised by dysplastic changes confined to the epidermis without invasion into the dermis. Basal cell carcinoma (Option B): Basal cell carcinoma (BCC)",
