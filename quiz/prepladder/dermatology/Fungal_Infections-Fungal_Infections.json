      "question": "During your rural service, a patient arrives at the OPD with hypopigmented lesions on his trunk and back. A Wood’s lamp examination of the lesions shows yellow fluorescence, and scales become prominent when the lesion is scratched with nails. Which of the following organisms causes this infection?",
      "options": {
        "A": "Malassezia furfur",
        "B": "Microsporum audouinii",
        "C": "Trichophyton rubrum",
        "D": "Epidermophyton floccosum"
      },
      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: A) Malassezia furfur Explanation: The condition described is Pityriasis Versicolor, also known as Tinea Versicolor. The term \"tinea\" is a misnomer, as this infection is caused by the Malassezia species (including M. globosa, M. sympodialis, and M. furfur), not by dermatophytes like Microsporum or Trichophyton. Signs and Symptoms: Hypopigmented or hyperpigmented macules: Most commonly hypopigmentation due to the fungus's production of Azelaic Acid or Carboxylic Acid, found in the trunk, back, and chest. Lesions are often covered with fine “branny” scales , which are accentuated upon scraping; this sign is called the Besnier Sign or the Coup De Angle Sign. Examination Findings: Wood's Lamp Examination: It is typically yellow or gold in color , attributed to the presence of porphyrins produced by Malassezia species. KOH Preparation: \"Spaghetti and meatball\" aka “Banana and Grapes” appearance. Treatment: Topical Antifungal Agents such as ketoconazole cream or shampoo, selenium sulfide lotion, or ciclopirox olamine solution are used as first-line treatment. Oral Terbinafine and Griseofulvin do not help in the treatment of Tinea. Microsporum audouinii (Option B) Trichophyton rubrum (Option C) Epidermophyton floccosum (Option D ) The three fungi mentioned above are dermatophytic fungi that do not cause ptyriasis versicolor; they cause tinea in various body parts, as described below. Microsporum audouinii Trichophyton rubrum Epidermophyton floccosum Parts of the body affected Hair Body Hair Body Nail Body Nail Diseases Tinea capitis (scalp) Tinea corporis (ringworm) Tinea pedis (athlete's foot) Tinea cruris (jock itch) Tinea cruris (jock itch) Tinea pedis (athlete's foot)",

      "correct_answer": "D",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: D) Piedra Explanation: The given clinical scenario describes Seborrheic Dermatitis caused by the Malessezia (globosa [Most common] and furfur species) fungus . It is characterised by erythematous, greasy, and scaly lesions, often accompanied by itching and discomfort, in immunocompromised patients, as described in the image above. Primarily affects areas rich in sebaceous glands, such as the scalp, face, and upper trunk . Seborrheic dermatitis is also associated with other conditions, such as Parkinson's disease and immunosuppression . Treatment involves topical antifungal agents, such as ketoconazole or ciclopirox . Malessezia is known to cause folliculitis, Seborrheic dermatitis, dandruff, and confluent reticulate papillomatosis. On the other hand, piedra is a fungal infection of the hair shaft caused by fungi of the genus Trichosporon (white piedra) and piedra (black piedra). Folliculitis (Option A): Malassezia can lead to folliculitis, particularly pityrosporum folliculitis . It typically presents with erythematous papules or pustules centred around hair follicles, which may be tender or pruritic. Dandruff (Option B) also known as pityriasis capitis or seborrheic dermatitis of the scalp , is commonly associated with Malassezia spp., the same organism implicated in the patient's symptoms.",

        "C": "Microsporum canis",
        "D": "Trichophyton concentricum"
      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: B) Trichophyton Verrucosum Explanation: The condition described is most likely a kerion, a type of inflammatory tinea capitis (scalp ringworm ) caused by Trichophyton verrucosum. Tinea capitis is a fungal infection of the scalp that predominantly affects children. Kerion presents with symptoms, including patchy hair loss, scaling, and, in some cases, a painful, boggy swelling. The characteristic feature of kerion is its inflammatory nature , with erythematous, tender nodules commonly oozing pus It is often encountered in agricultural settings where there is exposure to infected animals, particularly cattle. Examination Findings KOH examination: Presence of branching hyphae. Wood's lamp examination: No specific findings. The inflammatory nature of kerion distinguishes it from other fungal infections. In severe cases of tinea capitis presenting as a kerion, both KOH mounts and fungal cultures can sometimes yield negative results. This is due to the body's robust immune response and inflammation, which can damage or kill the fungal elements, making them less likely to be detected in diagnostic tests. Treatment : Systemic Antifungal therapy: Oral antifungal medications such as Griseofulvin (Drug of choice) and terbinafine are the treatments of choice. Topical Antifungal Therapy: Topical antifungal agents, such as ketoconazole or ciclopirox , to address recurrence Antibiotics: In cases of secondary bacterial infection , antibiotics may be necessary to treat bacterial superinfection and reduce inflammation Fungal infections of the scalp are classified as follows: Tinea schoenleinii (Option A), also known as favus, typically",

      },
      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: C) Tinea nigra Explanation: The given clinical scenario suggests tinea nigra. Tinea nigra is a painless, superficial fungal infection primarily affecting the palms and is characterized by darkly pigmented, flat, non-scaly patches. Tinea nigra: Superficial fungal infection of the skin caused by the fungus Hortaea werneckii (formerly known as Exophiala werneckii ). Pathology: Thickening of stratum corneum (in which hyphae are present) and minimal inflammation of the dermis. Features: Asymptomatic, macular, sharply defined and non-scaly lesions. The most distinctive feature is the brown or black, resembling a silver nitrate stain. Areas affected: Palms (M/C), soles, neck, and trunk.

      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: A) Distal Lateral Subungual Onychomycosis Explanation: Distal Lateral Subungual Onychomycosis is the most common type of fungal infection of the toenail (Onymychosis) or Tinea Unguium . Clinically, onychomycosis presents with various manifestations, including Discoloration of the nails (yellow, brown, or white) Thickening of the nail plate Subungual hyperkeratosis (build-up of keratin debris under the nail) Onycholysis (separation of the nail plate from the nail bed) Nail dystrophy (deformation of the nail) Diagnosis: Typically involves microscopic examination using KOH and fungal culture of nail clippings. Treatment: Oral antifungals such as terbinafine and itraconazole are often preferred. Nail lacquers such as ciclopirox (applied daily), olamine and amirolfine (applied weekly) are also used as topical agents to treat onychomycosis. The table below describes the types of onychomycosis Distal lateral subungual onychomycosis Most common Primarily affecting the distal & lateral portions of the nail.

      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: A) Candida albicans (Intertrigo) Explanation: The clinical presentation of multiple erythematous, tender patches on the inferior surface of both breasts with multiple satellite lesions is highly indicative of intertrigo , a type of cutaneous candidiasis . Candida intertrigo (Flexural candidiasis): Sites involved: Between genital folds, groin & buttocks Armpits Inframammary folds (large & pendulous breasts) Under overhanging abdominal folds Umbilicus Webspace of toes & fingers. As the condition develops, it spreads beyond the area of contact, usually developing the typical features of candidiasis: a fringed, irregular edge, subcorneal pustules rupturing to give tiny erosions, and further peeling of the stratum corneum. Satellite lesions , pustular or papular, are classic. Soreness and itching, which may be intense on occasion, are usual. When the web spaces of the toes or fingers are involved, there is usually marked maceration along with a thick, white, horny layer. . Other cutaneous candidiasis: Paronychia and onychomycosis. Diaper candidiasis. Perianal candidiasis. Erosio interdigitalis blastomycetica (affects webs and toes). Generalized disseminated cutaneous candidiasis (in infants). Candida albicans: The most common & most pathogenic species of candida infecting humans thrive in warm & moist areas . Risk factors: Diabetes mellitus, immunocompromised state , broad-spectrum antibiotics, pregnancy, obesity, a ity, diet high in sugars, corticosteroids , and underlying medical conditions. Treatment: Topical antifungal creams or ointments such as clotrimazole, miconazole, or nystatin For more severe or recurrent infections, oral antifungal medications like fluconazole, itraconazole, or ketoconazole may be prescribed.",

        "D": "Oral griseofulvin"
      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: B) Oral Fluconazole Explanation: The clinical presentation of a frayed appearance, superficial pustules, and the presence of pseudohyphae on KOH examination is indicative of Balanitis due to Candida infection . Oral fluconazole is preferred for treating Candida infections involving the genital area due to its systemic action and effectiveness in eradicating the fungal infection in immunocompromised individuals. Microscopic tests for the diagnosis of candidal infection: KOH Preparation: Characteristic findings include oval-shaped budding yeast cells and elongated pseudohyphae (elongated cells that are not separated from each other). Candida exhibits the yeast form in the human body (approximately 37°C or 98.6°F) and the hyphal form in higher temperatures (98.6-107.6°F). Culture: On Sabourad's Dextrose agar (SDA ), Candida colonies appear creamy to white and smooth, often with a yeast-like or pasty texture. Germ Tube Test: It is a diagnostic test used to differentiate Candida albicans from other Candida species. It involves incubating yeast cells in human or animal serum at 37°C for 2-3 hours. Positive germ tube formation, characterised by the emergence of a hyphal projection (germ tube) from the yeast cell, is typically observed with Candida albicans. Local application of nystatin gel (Option A): Nystatin is an antifungal agent effective against Candida, commonly used to treat oral thrush and vulvovaginal candidiasis. However, its local application may not be adequate for treating balanitis, particularly if the infection is extensive or involves deeper tissue layers. Local application of terbinafine ointment (Option C): Terbinafine is primarily used to treat dermatophyte infections, such as tinea corporis or tinea cruris, and is",

      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: B) Wedge Shaped Perforations along the hair shaft Explanation: The hair perforation test is used to identify species of Trichophyton mentagrophytes from other dermatophytes such as Trichophyton rubrum. Trichophyton causes characteristic wedge-shaped perforations along the hair shaft , as shown in the image below; this is called a positive perforation test. Steps with hair perforation test: A strand of blonde, autoclaved hair is placed in water in a vial and incubated at room temperature. It is then inoculated with the test fungus. Individual hair is removed at intervals of up to 4 weeks and examined microscopically in lactophenol cotton blue. Isolates of T. mentagrophytes produce marked localised areas of pitting and erosion. Isolates of T. rubrum (a more common cause of tinea) do not produce marked pitting or erosion. Absence of hair perforation (Option A) – Seen in Trichophyton rubrum , which does not produce significant hair perforations, unlike T. mentagrophytes . Circular perforations inside the hair shaft (Option C) – More characteristic of Trichophyton verrucosum , which forms internal perforations instead of wedge-shaped indentations. Parallel perforations on either side of the hair shaft (Option D) – Not a recognized pattern in dermatophyte infections Reference: Ananth Narayanan and Panniker Textbook of Microbiology, 10th Edition, Page 601",

      "explanation": "Correct Answer: A) Asteroid Bodies Explanation: The patient’s presentation, along with the linear distribution of nodules, is suggestive of sporotrichosis/ Rose Gardner’s disease caused by Sporothrix schenckii. It is a Subcutaneous fungal infection that typically occurs after the fungus is traumatically inoculated into the skin, often through thorn pricks, splinters, or scratches from contaminated plant materials. Enzymes secreted by fungus, such as serine & aspartate proteinases help in local invasion. Sporothrix schenckii has a tendency to spread along lymphatics . Risk factors: Walking barefoot, farmers & gardeners. Clinical manifestations: Incubation period: 3 weeks Types: Lympho-cutaneous M/C type (80%) Painless modulo-ulcerative lesions along the lymphatics. Lymph nodes can become enlarged, suppurative & indurated and have cord-like feeling on palpation. Osteoarticular Seen in alcoholics . Pulmonary Can be seen in underlying COPD . Disseminated Seen in immunocompromised patients. Fixed cutaneous Single nodule , less progressive & not spread by lymphatics. Laboratory diagnosis: KOH mount: Elongated yeast cells of 3-5 I m in diameter (low sensitivity).
