      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: B) Plaque Explanation: The lesion is suggestive of plaque in psoriasis. Plaques are elevated circumscribed lesions > 1cm, Plaque in psoriasis is characterized by silvery scales on a thickened, erythematous base. Depending on the underlying cause, these lesions can be pink, red, brown, or skin-colored. Some common causes of plaques include: Psoriasis Eczema (specifically nummular eczema) Lichen planus Seborrheic dermatitis Pustule (Option A): A pustule is a type of skin lesion characterized by a small, circumscribed elevation of the skin that contains pus. Pustules are usually < 1cm in size Nodule (Option C): Nodules are a type of skin lesion characterized by solid, palpable, elevated masses that extend into the dermis or subcutaneous tissue. They are >1 cm in size and range in depth from 1 to 10 mm. Wheal (Option D): Wheals are a type of skin lesion characterized by transient, edematous (swollen), elevated areas on the skin. These areas are typically pink or red and have well-defined borders.",

      "explanation": "Correct Answer: B) Pustule Explanation: A pustule is a small, circumscribed elevation of the skin containing pus. They typically appear as small, white or yellowish bumps on the skin's surface. Pustules may have a visible central point where the pus is located. Wheal (Option A): Wheal is a transient type of skin lesion characterized by edematous, swollen and elevated dermis and hypodermis. Nodules (Option C): Nodules are solid, palpable, elevated masses that extend into the dermis or subcutaneous tissue. They are larger and deeper than papules, which are similar in appearance but smaller. They are >1 cm in size and range in depth from 1 to 10 mm. Bullae (Option D): Bullae are blisters more than 1 cm on the skin that are filled with clear fluid",

      "correct_answer": "D",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: D) Purpura Explanation: Purpura is a primary skin lesion. It is a condition with red, discoloured spots on the skin that do not blanch on pressure. The spots are caused by bleeding underneath the skin. Purpura measure between 4 and 10 mm in diameter. When purpura spots are less than 4 mm in diameter, they are called Petechiae. Purpura spots larger than 1 cm are called Ecchymoses . All the below lesions are secondary skin lesions. Atrophy (Option A): Atrophy refers to the loss of tissue from either or all the layers of skin (Epidermis, Dermis, Subcutaneous tissue). If the process is superficial, there may be fine wrinkling and translucency. Induration (Option B): Induration refers to the dermal thickening that clinically appears firmer than normal on palpation. Crust (Option C): The crust consists of dried-up discharge from the lesions.",

      "correct_answer": "D",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: D) Scales - Seborrheic dermatitis Explanation: Scales are visible exfoliation of the skin containing flakes of stratum corneum. Seborrheic dermatitis: Seborrheic dermatitis is characterized by yellow, greasy scales covering the scalp , extending to the hairline and behind the ears. Seborrheic dermatitis is a common inflammatory skin condition primarily affecting areas rich in sebaceous glands, such as the scalp, face, and trunk. It is characterized by erythematous plaques with adherent, greasy scales, often associated with itching and mild redness. Fissures (Option A) are linear breaks or cracks in the skin that are not typically associated with seborrheic dermatitis. Atrophy (Option B) describes the thinning of the skin, resulting in a decrease in the thickness of the epidermis and dermis. Pityriasis rosea is not typically associated with atrophy. Target lesions (Option C) are less than 3 cm in diameter and have three or more zones, usually a central area of dusky erythema or purpura, a middle paler zone of oedema, and an outer ring of erythema with a well I defined edge. Pityriasis versicolor presents with hypo- or hyperpigmented macules with fine scaling, but it is not typically associated with target lesions.",

      },
      "correct_answer": "D",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: D) Lichenification Explanation: Lichenification is characterised by the thickening of the Epidermis and dermis due to prolonged scratching. It is a secondary skin lesion associated with thick skin, hyperpigmentation and exaggerated skin markings. It is associated with the following characteristic features in HPE Acanthosis (thickening of the epidermis) Hyperkeratosis (thickening of the stratum corneum) Elongation of rete ridges Chronic inflammatory infiltrate in the dermis. Erosion (Option A) is a loss of the epidermis, which heals without scarring. Ulcer (Option B) is a loss of the dermis and epidermis, often with loss of the underlying tissues. Poikiloderma (Option A) is an association of Cutaneous pigmentation (Hypo or Hyper pigmentation) Atrophy Telangiectasia (Visible dilatation of small blood vessels, particularly the capillaries, in the dermal layer of the skin).",

        "A": "Langer lines - Gorlin syndrome",

      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: B) Blaschko lines - Incontinentia pigmenti Explanation: The described linear rash following a distinct geometric pattern with parallel lines, often in a V-shaped distribution over the spine, is characteristic of Blaschko lines. Blaschko lines represent a pathway of normal epidermal cell migration during embryonic development. Incontinentia pigmenti is an X-linked dominant disorder associated with Blaschko lines. It presents distinctive cutaneous findings, including linear vesicles, papules, and hyperpigmentation following the distribution of these lines. Other diseases associated with Blaschko disease are Epidermal naevi and Hypomelanosis of Ito. Options A and C: Langer lines refer to the natural orientation of collagen fibres in the skin, which influence wound healing and surgical incision planning. Gorlin syndrome, also known as nevoid basal cell carcinoma syndrome, is associated with multiple basal cell carcinomas, odontogenic keratocysts, and skeletal abnormalities but is not directly linked to Langer lines. CafÃ©-au-lait spots and neurofibromas characterize neurofibromatosis type 1 but are not specifically associated with Langer lines. Kraissl's lines (Option D) represent the relaxed skin tension lines of the breast and are pertinent in breast surgery planning. Linear morphea is a form of localized scleroderma characterized by linear patches of sclerosis, but it is not associated with Kraissl's lines.",
