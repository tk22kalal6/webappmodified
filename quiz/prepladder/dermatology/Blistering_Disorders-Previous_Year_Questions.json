      "question": "A patient on anti-PD1 immunotherapy (nivolumab) comes with pruritis, eczema, and urticarial rashes. Histopathological examination reveals a subepidermal blister and direct immunofluorescence of the lesions showed linear C3 and IgG on basement membrane. What isthe diagnosis?",
      "options": {
        "A": "Dermatitis herpetiformis",
        "B": "Pemphigus vulgaris",
        "C": "Pemphigus foliaceous",
        "D": "Bullous Pemphigoid"
      },
      "correct_answer": "D",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: D) Bullous Pemphigoid Explanation: Bullous Pemphigoid: BP is a common subepidermal immunobullous disorder mainly affecting elder people. Autoantibodies against hemidesmosomal target proteins BP230(BPAG1) and BP180(BPAG2) which finally leads to bullae formation. It is characterised by a prodromal non bullous stage with pruritis which is followed by a bullous stage. The later has intense pruritus with tense blisters and vesicles. These blisters show a negative Nikolsky sign but a positive Bulla spread sign. The rupture of blisters leads to yellow or hemorrhagic crust formation, which later heal without any scar. Oral lesions can occur sometimes. HPE shows a subepidermal split with inflammatory infiltrate, immunofluorescence shows a linear binding of immunoglobulin (IgG and C3) at the dermo-epidermal junction. Topical and systemic steroids are the mainstay of treatment. Dermatitis herpetiformis (Option A) DH is a gluten-sensitive enteropathy associated with deposition of IgA in the dermal papillae, not linear IgG or C3 at the basement membrane. DH typically shows granular IgA deposition in immunofluorescence and not the linear patterns seen here. Pemphigus vulgaris (Option B) PV is characterized by intraepidermal blistering and acantholysis (loss of cell-to-cell adhesion between keratinocytes). Immunofluorescence shows intercellular IgG (not linear staining at the basement membrane zone). The presence of subepidermal blisters here excludes PV. Pemphigus foliaceous (Option C) PF is another type of pemphigus that features intraepidermal blistering and acantholysis but lacks subepidermal blistering. Immunofluorescence in PF typically shows intercellular IgG, not the linear IgG and C3 at the basement membrane observed in this case.",

      "question": "A 45-year-old male comes with recurrent blisters and oral ulcers for 3 years. The histology is as shown. What is the diagnosis of this patient?",
      "options": {
        "A": "Pemphigus vulgaris",
        "B": "Dermatitis herpetiformis",
        "C": "Bullous pemphigoid",
        "D": "Linear IgA disease"
      },
      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: A) Pemphigus vulgaris Explanation: The above clinical features and HPE findings in this patient suggest the diagnosis of Pemphigus vulgaris (PV), which most commonly has antibodies against Desmoglein 3. Pemphigus vulgaris: PV is the most common chronic autoimmune blistering disease caused by antibodies against desmosomal adhesion proteins. They are characterized by the presence of flaccid blisters filled with clear fluid present on normal skin or an erythematous base. The blisters rupture producing painful erosion. Mucosal involvement is a very important and one of the distinguishing features of PV. Histopathology: Intraepidermal cleavage with acantholysis (detached keratinocytes) primarily localized to the suprabasal region Separation of basal keratinocytes along the basement membrane zone, resulting in an appearance that resembles a \"row of tombstones\" The target antigens for PV are most commonly Desmoglein 3 and sometimes Desmoglein 1. The image below shows the common target antigen in Intraepidermal Immunobullous Disorders. Dermatitis herpetiformis (Option B) Associated with celiac disease and characterized by intensely pruritic, grouped vesicles typically on extensor surfaces. Shows granular IgA deposits on immunofluorescence, not intercellular IgG. Bullous pemphigoid (Option C) Causes subepidermal blisters and does not commonly present with oral ulcers. Immunofluorescence shows linear IgG and C3 at the dermal-epidermal junction. Linear IgA disease (Option D) Characterized by linear IgA deposits at the basement membrane zone. Typically causes subepidermal blistering, not intraepidermal, and oral ulcers are less common.",
