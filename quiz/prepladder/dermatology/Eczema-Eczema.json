      },
      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: A. Topical steroids Explanation: The patient presents with a mild flare of AD for which the initial management is topical steroids (ointment if lichenified; cream if scaly/oozy) along with emollients. Management of atopic dermatitis includes Controlling environmental factors like removing triggers(ex dust), avoiding extreme temperatures, detergents, and harsh soaps. Restoring the compromised barrier: Hydration using emollients and moisturizers) Emollients soften the skin, reduce itch, and enhance the effect of topical corticosteroids. Persistent use of emollients when the inflammation is in remission may reduce the time and frequency of flare-ups. Pharmacological treatment:- Localized condition: Topical corticosteroids +/- antihistamines +/- antibiotics For face: Calcineurin inhibitors (pimecrolimus and tacrolimus) Severe disease (systemic management): Oral corticosteroids, cyclosporine, and azathioprine. Newer drugs : Crisabole: PDE-4 inhibitor (topical). Dupilumab: IL-4 receptor alpha antagonist (systemic). Tofacitinib: JAK kinase inhibitors Apremilast: PDE-4 inhibitor (also used in psoriasis) Atopic eczema treatment algorithm: TCI- topical calcineurin inhibitors; TCS, topical corticosteroids.",

      "correct_answer": "D",
      "explanation": "likely has pityriasis alba (PA). Pityriasis alba is a benign condition that predominantly affects children and adolescents and is associated with atopic asthma. The classical presentation is multiple hypopigmented, scaly, round, or oval macules and patches, predominantly over the face, upper trunk, and upper limbs. These may be associated with mild erythema or scaling. On Wood's lamp examination, lesions are nonfluorescent. It is a self-limited condition, treatment options include emollients, low-potency topical corticosteroids, and topical calcineurin inhibitors. Incorrect explanations: Option A: Tinea versicolor: It is caused by Malasezzia species and is more common in the truncal region. It presents with hypo or hyperpigmentation in patients with oily and sweaty skin and fine scales on scratching. There may be mild pruritus and erythema with yellow to green fluorescence on Wood’s lamp . The KOH mount shows a spaghetti and meatball appearance. Treatment includes antifungal agents like topical selenium sulfide and topical ketoconazole. KOH mount: Wood's lamp: Option B: Indeterminate leprosy lacks scales on examination. Indeterminate Hansen presents with a single lesion. Option C: Vitiligo presents with depigmented milky white patches without scaling.",

      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: A. Azole-based shampoo Explanation: The given case scenario describes seborrheic dermatitis (SD) , an inflammatory response to colonization by the Malassezia fungal species. In adults and adolescents, it is characterized by yellow, greasy scales involving the face, scalp (dandruff), nasolabial folds, and retro auricular region due to the major activity of sebaceous glands here leading to increased sebum production. It is also seen in infants < 3 months old due to presence of maternal androgens. Involvement of the scalp and face leads to a characteristic finding called cradle cap. It is also called infantile seborrheic dermatitis. Management includes stopping Malassezia growth using antifungals like Topical creams: Azoles (Sertaconazole, Propiconazole, Luliconazole) · Azole, zinc pyrithione (ZPTO), ciclopirox olamine, and selenium sulfide-based shampoo Topical corticosteroids or Topical calcineurin inhibitors + Shampoo or Azoles for dry erythema Antihistamines for itching Oral antifungals (itraconazole, fluconazole) for severe and unresponsive disease No oil application, as sebaceous",

      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: B. Lichenification Explanation: The given clinical scenario likely describes acute eczema that does not show lichenification, which is a feature of chronic eczema. Eczema or atopic dermatitis is a chronic, pruritic, inflammatory condition of the skin. The pattern of the rash varies with age Infantile phase (<2 years): The lesions are present on the face and extensor aspect of the knees and elbows consisting of erythema and discrete or confluent oedematous papules. The papules may become exudative and crusted. Childhood phase (2 years to puberty): Presents as erythema, crusting, excoriation, hyper and hypopigmentation, and warty lichenification involving the elbow and knee flexures. Adult phase : Similar to the childhood phase with more localized and lichenified lesions. Based on the duration of complaints, eczema may be acute, subacute, or chronic. Acute eczema presents with itching and dryness of the skin. Examination findings include signs of inflammation - erythema, oedema, vesicles, oozing, and crusting. Chronic eczema results from long-term untreated or inadequately treated eczema. Exam findings include lichenification, increased skin markings, hyperpigmentation, and thickening of the skin as shown below. Subacute eczema lies in between acute and chronic eczema - erythema and scaling may be seen.",

      "correct_answer": "D",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: D) Depends on intensity, duration and concentration of substance Explanation: This patient presents with: Acute onset of itchy and burning lesions Confined to the area of contact (hands) After exposure to a new detergent No prior sensitisation history These features are most consistent with Irritant Contact Dermatitis (ICD) . ICD depends on: Intensity of the irritant (e.g., detergent chemicals) Duration of contact Concentration of the substance used Irritant contact dermatitis Allergic contact dermatitis Onset Within minutes to hours of exposure Sensitization with first exposure, lesions with subsequent exposure - may be days/ weeks later Pathogenesis Direct disruption of the epidermal barrier, inflammation, and cellular immunity activation.

      "explanation": "hours. Patch tests are usually used to detect contact allergy of the delayed hypersensitivity type. They are usually read at 48–72 h, 96 h and again after 1 week, but can also be read at 15–30 min to detect contact urticaria. If only one patch test reading is possible, a day 4 reading has been recommended. Indications for patch testing Allergic contact dermatitis Eczematous disorders failing to respond to treatment (including occupational) The back is the most commonly used site. Before testing, the site should be free of eczema. Finn chambers or discs are used to ensure the allergen contacts the skin. The discs are applied and removed after 48 hours. A typical regimen is a 48 h application time, with readings taken 1 h after removal and again 48 h later (that is day 2 and day 4). A single day 2 reading is not advised as it may lead to the labelling of some marginal irritants as allergens and positive reactions to more poorly absorbed allergens may be missed. If only one patch test reading is possible, a day 4 reading has been recommended. The positive result might include erythema, papule, pustule, and vesicles at the site of application. It might also lead to thickening of the dermis.",

It is typically seen in patients with long-standing varicose veins/ venous insufficiency. Risk factors include a family history of venous disease, standing occupations (security guard), obesity, female sex, and prior deep vein thrombosis. Chronic pooling of blood/ venous hypertension leads to circulatory changes in the dermis including dilated capillaries and increased permeability that lead to pericapillary fibrin cuffs, oedema, leucocyte accumulation, and hemosiderin deposits. VE is characterized by erythematous, scaling patches/ plaques over a background of chronic oedema. The medial ankle is most commonly involved, and the changes may extend up to the knee. With time, due to pruritus, there may be lichenification, scaling, and even ulceration. Varicose ulcer most commonly involves gaiter area[lower 1/3rd of leg ] Incorrect options explanation: A. Dyshidrotic eczema ( aka Pompholyx) : This is a condition associated with atopic dermatitis that presents with vesicles over the palms and fingers (classically on sides of fingers). C.
