      "explanation": "plaques over the popliteal fossae (behind the knees) . The history of itching and involvement of flexural areas (neck, popliteal, and cubital fossae) is highly characteristic of Atopic Dermatitis (Eczema) . Atopic Dermatitis: Common in children , associated with atopy (asthma, allergic rhinitis, eczema) . Hallmark features: Chronic pruritus and inflammation . Flexural involvement in children and adults. Lichenification due to chronic scratching . Infants: More likely to have cheeks, trunk, and extensor limb involvement . Exacerbating factors: Irritants, allergens, weather changes, infections. Diagnosis: Clinical diagnosis based on chronic relapsing course and typical distribution . No specific lab test required . Elevated IgE levels may be seen but are not diagnostic . Management: Moisturisation (Emollients) – cornerstone of therapy. Topical corticosteroids – for flare-ups (mild to moderate strength). Antihistamines – for pruritus relief. Avoid triggers (harsh soaps, allergens, irritants). Severe cases: Topical calcineurin inhibitors (Tacrolimus), systemic immunosuppressants if needed. Dermatitis Herpetiformis",

      "question": "What is the most probable diagnosis for a child who has displayed symptomless lesions on the forearm and shaft of the penis, as depicted in the image of the forearm lesions below?",
      "options": {
        "A": "Lichen planus",
        "B": "Lichen nitidus",
        "C": "Scrofuloderma",
        "D": "Scabies"
      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "shiny papules on the forearm. The history of symptomless lesions on the forearm and shaft of the penis is characteristic of Lichen Nitidus . Lichen Nitidus: Rare chronic inflammatory disorder . Presents as multiple, asymptomatic, tiny, uniform, skin-coloured to hypopigmented, dome-shaped papules . Common sites: Forearms Dorsum of hands Shaft of the penis (pathognomonic location) Trunk Aetiology: Unknown, but associated with atopic dermatitis, Crohn’s disease, and lichen planus . Diagnosis: Clinical; biopsy if needed shows lymphocytic infiltrate in a \"claw clutching a ball\" pattern . Management: No treatment required if asymptomatic. If symptomatic, topical steroids, emollients, or calcineurin inhibitors can be used. Usually self-limiting but may persist for months to years. Lichen Planus (Option A) is incorrect because Lichen planus presents as violaceous, flat-topped, pruritic papules with Wickham’s striae . Usually involves flexor wrists, oral mucosa, and lower back but not commonly the shaft of the penis . Scrofuloderma (Option C) is incorrect because it is a tuberculous skin infection that presents as cold abscesses and sinus tracts overlying lymph nodes or bones, not as discrete, shiny papules . Scabies (Option D) is incorrect because scabies causes intensely pruritic papules, vesicles, and burrows , commonly found in finger webs, axillae, and genital areas . The absence of itching and burrows makes scabies unlikely . Reference: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31869173/",

      "question": "What is the diagnostic test used to identify allergic contact dermatitis which is a delayed hypersensitivity reaction caused by external substances? ′ -maleimide binding test",
      "options": {
        "A": "Patch test",
        "B": "Radioimmunosorbent",
        "C": "Eosin-5",
        "D": "Nitroblue tetrazolium test"
      },
      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer A - Patch test The patch test is a commonly used diagnostic tool for identifying the causative allergens in allergic contact dermatitis. It involves applying small amounts of suspected allergens onto adhesive patches, which are then placed on the patient's skin (usually on the back). The patches remain in place for 48-72 hours. The presence of erythema, vesiculation, or induration at the site of patch application indicates a positive reaction, suggesting sensitivity to the tested allergen. Test Name Method Type of Allergy Detected Skin Prick Test (SPT) Small amounts of allergens are pricked into the skin IgE-mediated (e.g., pollen, food, dust mites) Intradermal Test Allergen injected into the dermis Drug, venom, or weak SPT allergens Patch Test Allergens applied on a patch and placed on skin Contact dermatitis (e.g., metals, chemicals) Serum IgE Test (RAST) Measures allergen-specific IgE in blood Food, environmental, drug allergies Incorrect Options: Radioimmunosorbent (RAST) (Option B) : The RAST test is a blood test used to measure specific IgE antibodies in the serum. Allergic contact dermatitis is a delayed-type hypersensitivity reaction mediated by T-cells, and it does not involve IgE antibodies. Therefore, the RAST test is not appropriate for diagnosing allergic contact dermatitis. Eosin-5 ′ -maleimide binding test (Option C) : The eosin-5 ′ -maleimide binding test is a laboratory test used to assess the presence of hereditary spherocytosis, a congenital hemolytic anemia. It is not relevant for diagnosing allergic contact dermatitis. Nitroblue tetrazolium (NBT) test (Option D) : It is primarily used in the diagnosis of chronic granulomatous disease, an inherited disorder characterized by defective neutrophil function. This test is not related to the diagnosis of allergic contact dermatitis. Reference: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK537020/",

        "D": "Erysipelas"
      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "pruritic lesions on flexural site increases the likelihood of atopic dermatitis Atopic dermatitis, also known as eczema, is a chronic inflammatory ski n condition characterized by itchy, red, and inflamed skin lesions. It is commonly associated with a personal or family history of asthma, hay fever, or other allergic conditions. Incorrect Options Option A: Seborrhoeic dermatitis is a common, chronic, and relapsing skin condition characterized by red, scaly, and greasy patches, typically affecting areas rich in sebaceous glands such as the scalp, face, and upper trunk. It is not typically associated with a positive family history of asthma, making it less likely in this scenario. Option C: Allergic contact dermatitis is an inflammatory skin reaction that occurs when the skin comes into contact with a specific allergen or irritant. It usually presents as a localized rash with redness, swelling, and itching. While it is possible for individuals with atopic dermatitis to develop allergic contact dermatitis, the patient's symptoms and family history are more suggestive of atopic dermatitis rather than a specific contact allergen. Option D: Erysipelas is a bacterial skin infection characterized by a well-defined, raised, and erythematous rash, usually on the face or lower extremities. It is typically associated with fever and systemic symptoms. The symptoms described in the case, including itching and the positive family history of asthma, are",

      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "allows sufficient time for allergic reactions to occur and helps ensure accurate interpretation of the test results. Contact dermatitis is a delayed hypersensitivity reaction, which can take a few days to appear. Therefore, it is important that a person does a patch test for 96 hours before using new products fully. Incorrect Options: Option A - 24 hours: This is too early for patch removal. Allergic reactions may take some time to develop, and 24 hours may not be sufficient for a reaction to manifest. Option C - 48 Hours: can be correct , but 72 hours is the upper limit , so better answer. Option D - 96 hours: This is beyond the recommended timeframe for patch removal. By 96 hours, the patch may have already been on the patient's skin for too long, increasing the risk of skin irritation or adverse reactions. Reference: Prepladder Notes",

PTBP is a s ensitizing agent that can induce an allergic reaction in some individuals, leading to depigmentation or leucoderma in the area where bindis are applied. Incorrect Options: Option A - Mono-benzyl ether of Hydroquinone (MBH): MBH is not directly associated with bindi leukoderma. While hydroquinone and its derivatives have been implicated in some cases of depigmentation. Option B - Crocein Scarlet MOO and Solvent Yellow 3: They are commonly used in industries such as textiles and not directly linked to the depigmentation seen in bindi leukoderma.

These conditions include atopic dermatitis, contact dermatitis, and seborrheic dermatitis. Topical steroids have potent anti-inflammatory properties and are commonly used to reduce inflammation, itching, and redness associated with eczematous dermatitis. Incorrect Options: Option A - Dermal atrophy: Topical steroids, can cause dermal atrophy, thinning of the skin, and loss of elasticity. This adverse effect is not the desired outcome of treatment. Option C - Bullous lesion due to HSV: Topical steroids are generally not recommended for the treatment of bullous lesions caused by herpes simplex virus (HSV) infection.s. Option D - Rosacea: While topical steroids may provide temporary relief for some symptoms of rosacea, they are not considered the primary treatment for this condition. Reference: Prepladder Notes",
