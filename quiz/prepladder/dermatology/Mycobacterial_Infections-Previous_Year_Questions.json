      "question": "What is the preferred treatment for a pregnant woman who is 12 weeks pregnant and undergoing multidrug therapy for leprosy but is now experiencing type 2 lepra reaction?",
      "options": {
        "A": "Stop MDT and start oral steroids",
        "B": "Antibiotics",
        "C": "Thalidomide Continue MDT and add oral steroids",
        "D": "Continue MDT and add oral steroids"
      },
      "correct_answer": "D",
      "explanation": "nodosum leprosum, ENL) is an immune complex-mediated reaction seen in multibacillary leprosy. Pregnancy does not alter the management of leprosy itself, and stopping multidrug therapy (MDT) is not recommended. The preferred treatment for type 2 reactions includes oral corticosteroids , which are safe in pregnancy. Thalidomide is strictly contraindicated due to teratogenicity. Leprosy and Its Management in Pregnancy Aspect Details Cause of Leprosy Mycobacterium leprae Types of Reactions Type 1 (Reversal), Type 2 (Erythema Nodosum Leprosum) Type 2 Lepra Reaction Immune complex-mediated (Type III hypersensitivity) Common Symptoms Painful nodules, fever, malaise, neuritis Management of Type 2 Reaction Corticosteroids (safe in pregnancy) Role of MDT in Pregnancy Must be continued to prevent relapse Drugs to Avoid Thalidomide (teratogenic) Management of Type 2 Lepra Reaction in Pregnancy Aspect Details Continue MDT Essential to prevent disease relapse Preferred drug Oral steroids (prednisolone) Avoid in pregnancy Thalidomide (teratogenic, causes phocomelia) Supportive therapy Analgesics, wound care if ulcerated lesions present Alternative options Clofazimine has mild immunomodulatory effects Stop MDT and start oral steroids (Option A) is incorrect because stopping MDT can lead to disease relapse and worsening nerve damage . MDT must be continued while managing the reaction with steroids. Antibiotics (Option B) is incorrect because type 2 lepra reaction is an inflammatory immune response , not an infectious complication. Antibiotics have no role in managing ENL itself. Thalidomide (Option C) is incorrect because thalidomide is highly teratogenic (causing phocomelia and limb defects) and is absolutely contraindicated in pregnancy. Although thalidomide is an effective treatment for ENL, it should never be used in pregnant women.

        "A": "Multibacillary leprosy",
        "B": "Psoriasis",
        "C": "Tinea versicolor",
        "D": "Paucibacillary leprosy"
      },
      "correct_answer": "D",
      "explanation": "suggest leprosy rather than other dermatological conditions. Well-demarcated, slightly raised lesions are characteristic of paucibacillary leprosy , which presents with five or fewer skin lesions with nerve involvement. Skin smears revealing no acid-fast bacilli indicate a low bacterial load , confirming paucibacillary leprosy rather than multibacillary leprosy . Leprosy: Leprosy (Hansen’s disease) is a chronic infectious disease caused by Mycobacterium leprae , primarily affecting the skin, peripheral nerves, and mucosa of the upper respiratory tract . It presents in a spectrum based on bacterial load and immune response.

      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: C) Borderline leprosy Explanation: Borderline leprosy is part of the spectrum of Hansen’s disease (leprosy) and is characterised by: Variable number of hypopigmented or hyperpigmented lesions that are asymmetrically distributed. Patchy partial loss of sensation within the lesions, a key diagnostic clue. Borderline forms are unstable , and patients may shift toward either the lepromatous or tuberculoid pole. Scalp involvement is uncommon in most forms of leprosy but can be seen in borderline cases. Ridley-Jopling Classification of Leprosy: Tuberculoid leprosy (TT) – Few well-demarcated hypopigmented patches with complete loss of sensation . Strong cell-mediated immunity (CMI) . Borderline tuberculoid (BT) – Multiple asymmetrical lesions, less well-defined than TT, with some sensory loss. Borderline leprosy (BB) – Intermediate form, variable lesions with partial sensory loss , and patchy nerve involvement . Borderline lepromatous (BL) – Numerous lesions resembling LL but with some sensory impairment. Lepromatous leprosy (LL) – Diffuse,",

      "options": {
        "A": "No spontaneous remission is seen",
        "B": "Half of the cases resolve spontaneously after bacilli exposure",
        "C": "Spontaneous remission is more common in children than in adults",
        "D": "Indeterminate leprosy have more remission than tuberculoid"
      },
      "correct_answer": "D",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: D) Indeterminate leprosy have more remission than tuberculoid Explanation: Indeterminate leprosy is the earliest form of leprosy, presenting with a single or few ill-defined hypopigmented macules and minimal sensory loss. In many cases, spontaneous remission occurs , particularly in individuals with a strong cell-mediated immune (CMI) response . Tuberculoid leprosy , while having a strong immune response, tends to be chronic and persistent , with less likelihood of spontaneous remission. Indeterminate Leprosy: Early, undifferentiated form of leprosy . Few hypopigmented macules with slight sensory impairment. Histopathology : Mild inflammation, sparse acid-fast bacilli (AFB) . Fate : Can resolve spontaneously (~25–75% of cases) . May progress to tuberculoid or lepromatous forms, depending on immune response. Tuberculoid Leprosy: Well-demarcated plaques with sensory loss , few lesions. Strong CMI response , granuloma formation. Less likely to remit spontaneously , tends to persist unless treated. Outcomes if Untreated: Indeterminate leprosy has a higher chance of spontaneous remission compared to tuberculoid leprosy. If it does not resolve, it may progress toward the tuberculoid or lepromatous spectrum based on immune status. No spontaneous remission is seen (Option A) is incorrect because spontaneous remission does occur , particularly in indeterminate and early tuberculoid leprosy , especially in individuals with good immunity. Half of the cases resolve spontaneously after bacilli exposure (Option B) is incorrect because while some individuals clear the infection, the proportion is variable and not as high as 50% in all populations . Spontaneous remission is more common in children than in adults (Option C) is incorrect because although children may have a higher rate of spontaneous resolution , the likelihood of remission is more dependent on the type of leprosy (indeterminate vs tuberculoid) rather than age alone .

      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: B) Continue MDT, start systemic steroids Explanation: Deterioration of preexisting lesions + nerve involvement in a patient on MDT suggests Type 1 Lepra Reaction (Reversal Reaction) . Type 1 Reaction is a delayed hypersensitivity reaction in borderline leprosy due to increased cell-mediated immunity . Management: Continue MDT : The reaction is due to immune response, not drug failure. Start systemic corticosteroids (prednisolone) to reduce inflammation and prevent permanent nerve damage. Lepra Reactions Type Mechanism Clinical Features Management Type 1 (Reversal Reaction) Increased cell-mediated immunity (CMI) Worsening of existing lesions , erythema, edema, nerve pain Continue MDT , start systemic steroids (prednisolone) Type 2 (Erythema Nodosum Leprosum - ENL) Immune complex deposition (TNF- α mediated) Painful nodules , fever, neuritis, systemic symptoms Continue MDT , start thalidomide or steroids Stop MDT, start systemic corticosteroids (Option A): Incorrect because MDT should not be stopped ; the reaction is due to immune response, not drug toxicity. Stop MDT, start thalidomide (Option C): Incorrect because thalidomide is used for Type 2 reaction (ENL), not Type 1 reaction . Continue MDT, start thalidomide (Option D): Incorrect because thalidomide is ineffective for Type 1 reactions; steroids are preferred .",

      "explanation": "primarily affects the peripheral nerves without significant skin involvement. It is characterized by nerve damage and inflammation, leading to sensory and motor impairments. To diagnose neuritic leprosy, a nerve biopsy is often performed to examine the affected nerve tissue for the presence of Mycobacterium leprae, the bacteria that causes leprosy. The superficial branch of the radial nerve is commonly chosen for the biopsy due to its accessibility and involvement in the affected nerve region. Incorrect options: Option A . Median nerve: The median nerve is not typically biopsied for the diagnosis of neuritic leprosy. While it can be affected in leprosy, it is not the primary nerve chosen for biopsy in cases of neuritic leprosy. Option C. Ulnar nerve: Similar to the median nerve, the ulnar nerve can be affected in leprosy, but it is not the nerve of choice for biopsy in cases of neuritic leprosy. Option D . Lateral popliteal nerve: The lateral popliteal nerve, also known as the common peroneal nerve, is not specifically associated with neuritic leprosy. While leprosy can affect peripheral nerves throughout the body, the superficial branch of the radial nerve is the nerve commonly biopsied for the diagnosis of neuritic leprosy, not the lateral popliteal nerve.
