      "explanation": "Correct Answer: A) Hemidesmosomes Explanation: Hemidesmosomes(HD), anchoring filaments, and anchoring fibrils are present at the dermal-epidermal junction and maintain the integrity of the skin. The lower end of the epidermis is made up of basal keratinocytes. Hemidesmosomes are attachment complexes that connect the keratin intermediate filaments within the basal keratinocytes to the lamina lucida with the help of anchoring filaments (Option B). Lamina lucida(LL) and densa(LD) are part of dermal–epidermal basement membrane forming the interface between the two (Option C). The anchoring filaments are thread-like structures passing under the HD and merge with the lamina densa. Whereas anchoring fibrils are U I shaped structures extending from lamina densa to the upper reticular dermis (Option D).",

      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "Correct answer: A) Collagen VII Explanation: The above clinical scenario and immunofluorescence showing granular + linear IgG and C3 deposits in the dermo-epidermal junction suggest bullous systemic lupus erythematosus(BSLE). The main antibodies in this case are directed against collagen VII. Bullous systemic lupus erythematosus(BSLE): BSLE is an autoimmune subepidermal blistering disease that occurs in patients with SLE. The target antigen here is type VII collagen. On top of the SLE symptoms, patients with BSLE present with acute-onset vesicles and blisters, with a predilection for sun I exposed areas like neck, upper trunk, and proximal extremities. HPE would show subepidermal splitting with immunofluorescence showing granular + linear IgG and C3 deposits in the dermo-epidermal like other related bullous disorders. Anti-CCP antibodies (Option B) are seen in patients with rheumatoid arthritis. Ro La antibodies (Option C) are classical of SCLE. But this patient’s current condition is BSLE which mainly has antibodies against collagen VII causing the above skin lesions. Anti-transglutaminase antibodies (Option D) are seen in dermatitis herpetiformis, which presents with pruritic vesicles and erosions involving the extensor surfaces.

      },
      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: C) Granular IgA deposition in the papillary dermis Explanation: The girl with the above lesions associated with chronic diarrhea most likely has dermatitis herpetiformis, which shows granular IgA deposition in the papillary dermis. Dermatitis herpetiformis(DH): It is a skin condition associated with gluten I sensitive enteropathy seen in patients with celiac disease. These patients are sensitive to gluten-containing diets which cause chronic diarrhoea and malabsorption. Elimination of a gluten-containing diet resolves diarrhoea in these patients. The disease is associated with HLA-DQ2 and HLA-DQ8 and has IgA autoantibodies against transglutaminases. DH presents as pruritic, grouped erythematous papules and vesicles on extensor surfaces like the elbow, knee, etc. Because of intense pruritis, intact vesicles are rare and most present with excoriations. HPE will show subepidermal blister formation with neutrophils located at the tips of the dermal papillae. Immunofluorescence will show the deposition of IgA in the papillary dermis in a granular or fibrillar pattern known as picket fence pattern of IF HPE with papillary abscess and infiltrate Immunofluorescence with IgA in papillary dermis Management includes a gluten I free diet that improves diarrhoea as well as skin lesions. Dapsone is given for targeting pruritis and skin lesions. Epidermal intercellular deposition of IgG (Option A) is a feature of the pemphigus group due to antibodies against desmoglein 1 and 3. They present with vesicles and bullae involving many parts and are not associated with diarrhoea. Linear IgA deposition at the dermo-epidermal junction (Option B) is a feature of linear IgA disease. The lesions would show a characteristic crown of jewels appearance. Epidermal intercellular and subepidermal deposition of IgG (Option D) is a feature of paraneoplastic pemphigus",

Salt split technique(SST): To a skin biopsy specimen, 1 molar of NaCl is added and left to sit for some time. This splits the basement membrane at the level of lamina lucida, leaving 2 different targets for antibodies to be visualized on immunofluorescence microscopy. This is used to differentiate and diagnose blistering disorders. Immunofluorescence at the blister roof is seen in Mucous membrane pemphigoid Bullous pemphigoid Linear IgA disease Whereas immunofluorescence on the blister floor is seen in epidermolysis bullosa acquisita.

      "explanation": "Correct answer: D) Oral steroids are first-line management Explanation: The incorrect statement about linear IgA disease is that oral steroids are the first line of management, as the first line of management includes topical steroids or Dapsone. Linear IgA disease: It is an autoimmune blistering disorder with bimodal distribution in pediatric (peak<5 years) and adult patients (60 years). It is the most common autoimmune blistering disease in infants and children. The antigens BP 180 and LAD are targetted by IgA antibodies. Blisters and vesicles are formed in an annular pattern with blistering along the edges forming a string I of I pearls/crown of jewels appearance. It commonly affects the trunk and limbs but starts as perioral and perennial lesions in children. Mucosal involvement may be seen. HPE will show subepidermal blistering. Immunofluorescence will reveal a linear deposit of predominant or exclusive IgA at the dermo-epidermal junction. Dapsone is the first line of treatment. Oral steroids are used only in some cases to suppress blister formation. Reference: Rooks textbook of dermatology 9th ed, page no. 50.33-50.37",

      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Correct answer: B) C3 deposit along the dermo-epidermal junction Explanation: The most common microscopy finding in many cases of pemphigoid gestationis is the C3 deposit along the dermo-epidermal junction. Pemphigoid gestationis: It is a bullous disorder presenting mainly in late pregnancy or the immediate postpartum period. Circulating complement I fixing IgG antibodies bind to a BP I 180 in hemidesmosomes of the dermo-epidermal junction causing blisters. These blisters are formed in the subepidermal. It presents as intense pruritis with erythematous papules and plaques starting on the abdomen which later become tense blisters. The lesions show remission and exacerbation with most of them usually resolving after pregnancy Immunofluorescence is the gold standard test showing linear C3 deposition along the dermo-epidermal junction in 100% of cases and additional IgG deposition in 30% of cases. Management is done using topical and systemic steroids. Intraepithelial IgG Deposition (Option A) is a feature of pemphigus vulgaris and related disorders.

Pemphigus vulgaris: PV is the most common chronic autoimmune blistering disease caused by antibodies against desmosomal adhesion proteins. (Desmoglein 3>1) They are characterized by the presence of flaccid blisters filled with clear fluid present on normal skin or an erythematous base. The blisters rupture producing painful erosion. Mucosal involvement is a very important and one of the distinguishing features of PV. Histopathology: Intraepidermal cleavage with acantholysis (detached keratinocytes) primarily localized to the suprabasal region. (Intra spinous layer of epidermis) Separation of basal keratinocytes along the basement membrane zone, resulting in an appearance that resembles a \"row of tombstones\".

Since pemphigus is related to autoantibodies against desmogleins, management includes immunosuppression. Topical or intralesional steroids can be used to manage patients who present with oral disease and mild cutaneous involvement. However, in most cases with extensive involvement, the initial management is systemic corticosteroid therapy in combination with steroid I sparing agents(SSA).

Explanation: The above clinical features and Tzank smear showing separated keratinocytes or acantholytic cells is a feature of Pemphigus group of disorders and can be seen in PV or PF. However since the question mentions oral mucosa involvement, PV would be the answer as the mucosa is not involved in PF. Pemphigus Vulgaris: PV is an autoimmune blistering disorder that affects the skin and mucous membranes due to antibodies against Desmogleins 3 Acantholysis refers to the separation of keratinocytes from one another, resulting in the formation of intraepidermal clefts, vesicles, and bullae. It is seen in a group of diseases, including pemphigus and its variants, Darier disease, acantholytic dermatosis, and warty dyskeratoma. In pemphigus foliaceus and pemphigus erythematosus, acantholysis is seen in the upper portion of the epidermis, but in PV the split is formed at a lower level in the epidermis. Separation of basal keratinocytes along the basement membrane in PV results in the appearance of a row of tombstones as shown below.

      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "Correct answer: A) It is most commonly associated with lymphoma and leukemia Explanation: PNP is most frequently associated with hematologic malignancies, particularly non-Hodgkin lymphoma and other B cell lymphomas. Other associated neoplasms can include Castleman's disease, thymoma, chronic lymphocytic leukemia and sarcomas. The antigens associated include Envoplakin and Periplakin (most specific) Desmoglein1 and 3 Desmoplakin 1 and 2 Epiplakin and Plectin Bullous pemphigoid (BP) antigen 1 Oral mucosal involvement is actually a hallmark of PNP and is often severe and resistant to treatment. It can be one of the earliest and most persistent manifestations of the disease. (Option B) While autoantibodies against desmogleins (particularly desmoglein 3) can be present in PNP, they are not exclusive targets. PNP is characterized by autoantibodies against multiple antigens, predominantly members of the plakin family (including desmoplakin, envoplakin, and periplakin). (Option C) PNP generally has a worse prognosis compared to other forms of pemphigus. It is often more resistant to treatment and can be associated with significant morbidity and mortality, partly due to the underlying malignancy.

The patient has a history of vesicles and bullae , which later ruptured to form vegetative erosions in intertriginous areas- supporting the diagnosis. This is a rare variant of pemphigus vulgaris , often misdiagnosed without considering the specific morphology and location of lesions. Pemphigus Vegetans: A variant of pemphigus vulgaris , characterized by vegetating plaques . Flexural involvement is typical- especially in areas like groin, axillae, inframammary region. Develops after bullae or pustules rupture , leading to: Hypertrophic , granulating , exudative erosions. Lesions may become foul-smelling and infected. Oral mucosa may be involved: Cerebriform tongue (called Premlata sign ) Two subtypes : Neumann type – more severe , vesiculobullous onset. Hallopeau type – milder , pustular onset leading to vegetative growth. Differential Diagnoses: Diagnosis Key Features Pemphigus vegetans (Option D) Vegetating erosions in flexures; post-vesicular phase; cerebriform tongue (Premlata sign); Neumann/Hallopeau types.

      "explanation": "Correct Answer: D) Pemphigus herpetiformis Explanation: The given scenario is of pemphigus herpetiformis due to the presence of circulating IgG and C3 autoantibodies against DSG 1 or DSG 3. Pemphigus herpetiformis is a variant of pemphigus that resembles dermatitis herpetiformis(DH) clinically It is characterized by clusters of pruritic that develop on an erythematous background. Pruritis is due to eosinophils in the epidermis. Pemphigus herpetiformis has acantholysis while DH is intradermal pathology with papillary dermis involvement Immunofluorescence revealing intercellular staining is the key to diagnosis. Patients possess circulating IgG autoantibodies against DSG 1 or 3 and desmocollins 1 or 3 in some individuals. It may progress to PV or classical PF.

      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: C) Mucosa is not affected in pemphigus foliaceus. Explanation: Pemphigus foliaceus (PF) is a blistering disorder that typically affects the skin and spares the mucosa. Pemphigus vulgaris(PV) and foliaceus are autoimmune blistering disorders caused by antibodies against structural protein desmosomes (DSG). They affect the skin and mucosa in a unique way, which is explained by the distribution of DSG1 and 3 in the skin and mucosa. In skin, DSG1 is present throughout the epidermis whereas DSG3 is found only in the basal and immediate suprabasal layers. In mucosa, DSG 3 is expressed through all layers whereas DSG 1 is found only at low levels. Because DSG1 and 3 work together, antibodies against DSG1 cannot destabilize the oral mucosa, but they can significantly affect the skin. As a result, skin blistering without mucosal involvement is seen in PF patients who only have anti-DSG 1 antibodies. As PV has both DSG 3 and DSG 1 antibodies, both skin and mucosal lesions are seen.

Pemphigus foliaceus is a group of immunobullous disorders caused by antibodies against desmosomal proteins mainly Desmosome-1. Desmosomes maintain the structure of the epidermis through their adhesive function. It presents as superficial vesicles or bullae that rupture easily, causing eroded skin lesions with surrounding erythema and crusting. Pemphigus Vulgaris (Option A) presents as flaccid blisters and erosions involving both the skin and mucous membrane. The target antigens for PV is most commonly Desmoglein 3, sometimes desmoglein 1 Skin and mucosal lesions in PV Staphylococcal Scalded Skin Syndrome (SSSS) (Option C) is caused by epidermolytic toxin A and/or B, released by Staphylococcus aureus. It commonly presents in neonates as erythematous flaccid blisters and bullae that rupture to form crusting in the face, axillae, and groins. Mucosal involvement does not occur as seen in PV. Target antigen here is desmoglein 1 only but it affects infants and seborrhoeic sites are not involved predominantly. Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS) (Option D) and toxic",
