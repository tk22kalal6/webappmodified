      "question": "A 42 year old male who exercised vigorously presents to the emergency department with profuse sweating, flushed skin, and rapid breathing. His body temperature is elevated, and he appears dehydrated. Which of the following types of glandular secretion primarily contributes to the cooling mechanism observed in this patient?",
      "options": {
        "A": "Merocrine",
        "B": "Apocrine",
        "C": "Holocrine",
        "D": "Exocrine"
      },
      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: A) Merocrine Explanation: Merocrine secretion involves the release of secretory products through exocytosis without loss of cellular material. Thermoregulation is primarily done by eccrine sweat glands which typically have merocrine secretion. Eccrine sweat glands produce watery sweat by merocrine secretion directly onto the skin's surface. The sweat then evaporates, dissipating heat and aiding in the body's cooling. Some other examples of merocrine secretion include salivary glands and goblet cells in the intestinal epithelium. Apocrine (Option B): Apocrine secretion involves the release of cellular products along with portions of the cytoplasm. Apocrine sweat glands present in the axilla, perineum, and groin regions secrete their secretion into hail follicles by apocrine mechanism and are primarily responsible for producing body odour. The mammary gland (Modified apocrine gland) produces milk by apocrine secretion. Holocrine (Option C): Holocrine secretion involves the disintegration of entire cells filled with secretory products. Sebaceous glands in the skin utilize holocrine secretion to produce sebum, an oily substance that lubricates and waterproofs the skin and hair. Endocrine (Option C): Ductless glands secrete hormones directly into the bloodstream. They are involved in regulating various physiological processes and maintaining homeostasis within the the body.",

      "question": "A 55 year old male with a 10-year history of poorly controlled type 2 diabetes mellitus presents to the clinic with numbness and tingling sensation in the feet. He also reports no signs of sweating despite exposure to warm temperatures. Which of the following gland's functions is most likely to be impaired?",
      "options": {
        "A": "Eccrine sweat glands",
        "B": "Apocrine sweat glands",
        "C": "Sebaceous glands",
        "D": "Ceruminous glands"
      },
      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: A) Eccrine sweat glands Explanation: The clinical scenario suggests diabetic peripheral neuropathy in which autonomic dysfunction results in impaired sweat production. It may be partial (hypohidrosis) or complete (anhidrosis). Eccrine sweat glands are responsible for sweat production and thermoregulation. They are located all over the body (more in palms and soles), open directly into the skin, and are innervated by sympathetic cholinergic nerves. These glands have been active since childhood. Disorders of eccrine sweat glands include Hyperhidrosis, Hypo/Anhydrosis, Miliaria, and Neutrophilic eccrine hidradenitis. Apocrine glands (Option B): The apocrine sweat glands are responsible for producing body odor, and they have no role in thermoregulation. They are located in the axilla, groin, and perineum, open into the hair follicle above the sebaceous duct (pilosebaceous unit), and are innervated by adrenergic nerves. They become active at puberty. Disorders of Apocrine sweat glands include Bromhidrosis, Chromhidrosis, Fox Fordyce disease/ Apocrine miliaria, and Hidradenitis suppurativa. Sebaceous glands (Option C): These glands are responsible for the secretion of sebum into hair follicles that helps in moisturizing and lubricating the skin and hair. Disorders of the sebaceous gland include Acne vulgaris, Rosacea, and Seborrheic dermatitis. Ceruminous glands (Option D): Ceruminous glands are modified sweat glands located in the external auditory canal. They secrete a wax-like substance called cerumen, which helps moisturize and protect the ear canal from foreign particles. Reference: Rooks’s Textbook of Dermatology, 9th Edition, Page 94.10",

      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: B) Miliaria rubra Explanation: Miliaria rubra (prickly heat or heat rash) arises due to the occlusion or disruption of eccrine sweat ducts at the level of stratum spinosum in hot, humid conditions, resulting in sweat leakage into the epidermis. It is characterized by small, red papules or vesicles accompanied by itching or a prickling sensation. It typically occurs in areas of the body prone to sweating and friction during hot and humid weather. Miliaria crystallina (Option A) Miliaria profunda (Option C) Miliaria pustulosa (Option D) Obstruction of eccrine sweat duct at the level of stratum corneum. Seen in infants and are characterized by clear fluid thin vesicles that may rupture easily, leaving behind superficial peeling or desquamation. Obstruction of eccrine sweat duct at Dermo-epidermal junction. It is characterized by firm, flesh-coloured lesions or bumps beneath the skin's surface. It follows repeated attacks of miliaria rubra. It is an infected variant of miliaria rubra by Staphylococcus aureus. It is characterized by pustules or pus-filled lesions in addition to the typical features of miliaria rubra.",

      "correct_answer": "D",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: D) Bromohidrosis Explanation: Bromohidrosis, also known as malodor or osmidrosis, is a condition characterized by foul-smelling body odour caused by bacteria such as staphylococcus, micrococcus, corynebacterium, and propionibacterium breaking down apocrine secretion. It often occurs in areas with a high density of apocrine glands, such as the axillae and groin. Fox-Fordyce disease (Option A): Fox-Fordyce disease, also known as Apocrine miliaria, presents with multiple small, skin-coloured, or yellowish pruritic papules in areas with apocrine glands, such as the axillae, groin, perineum, and areolae of the breasts. Chromhidrosis (Option B): Chromhidrosis is the secretion of vividly coloured apocrine sweat, most commonly blue, yellow, or green, due to the secretion of lipofuscins in the apocrine sweat. Hyperhidrosis (Option C): It is a disorder of eccrine sweat glands characterized by profuse watery sweating of the axilla or palms and soles. Eccrine sweat glands are primarily involved in thermoregulation.",

        "D": "Genetic predisposition is not a contributing factor."
      },
      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: C) Comedones are the hallmark lesion. Explanation: The given clinical condition is diagnosed as Acne vulgaris, a chronic inflammatory skin condition associated with increased sebum production and the accumulation of dead skin cells within the follicles. Comedones are clogged hair follicles (pores) that contain a mixture of oil (sebum) and dead skin cells. They are the hallmark lesions of acne vulgaris. They are non-inflammatory lesions and are of two types: Open comedones (blackheads): These are follicles with a wider opening to the skin's surface and are not covered by the epidermis. When exposed to air, the keratin plug becomes oxidized and appears black. Closed comedones (whiteheads): These are follicles with a narrower opening to the skin's surface and are covered by the epidermis. The accumulation of sebum and dead skin cells creates a white or flesh-coloured bump beneath the skin's surface. It primarily affects individuals over the age of 40 and is also seen in adolescents (Option A): Acne vulgaris is typically seen in puberty and adolescence, not above the age of 40 years. It is not influenced by hormonal factors (Option B): Hormonal fluctuations, particularly increased levels of androgens (such as testosterone), can stimulate sebaceous gland activity, leading to increased sebum production. They are often associated with hormonal conditions like polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) and congenital Adrenal Hyperplasia (CAH). Genetic predisposition is not a contributing factor (Option D) : Genetic factors influence various aspects of acne development, including sebum production, follicular hyperkeratinization, and inflammatory responses. Thus, Genetic predisposition is a contributing factor to the development of acne vulgaris.",
