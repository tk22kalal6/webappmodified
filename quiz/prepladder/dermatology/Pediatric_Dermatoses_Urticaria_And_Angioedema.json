      },
      "correct_answer": "D",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: D) Toxic epidermal necrolysis Explanation : Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS) and toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN) are severe cutaneous adverse reactions characterized by extensive necrosis and detachment of the epidermis. Classification based on Body surface area involvement (BSA) SJS : <10 % of BSA detached (Option B ruled out) SJS/TEN overlap: 10 to 30 % of BSA detached TEN: >30 percent of BSA detached The term \"epidermal necrolysis\" collectively refers to SJS, SJS/TEN overlap, and TEN. Pathophysiology: The predominant cause of SJS/TEN is medication use, NSAIDs (Oxicam groups) Allopurinol. Anti epileptics: Lamotrigine, Carbamazepine Sulfonamides Anti retrovirals. The pathogenesis of SJS/TEN is predominantly a T cell-mediated reaction, often triggered by a genetic predisposition, particularly specific human leukocyte antigen (HLA) haplotypes. Necrosis of keratinocytes. Clinical presentation: The clinical presentation typically involves prodromal symptoms followed by cutaneous lesions that progress to extensive skin detachment. Atypical target lesions (Only 2 zones) Diffuse erythema -> Bullae -> Sheet-like epidermal peeling. Pseudo Nikolsky sign positive. Mucosal involvement is common and can affect various sites, including the oral, nasal, ocular, genital, and gastrointestinal mucosa. SCORTEN - developed to predict mortality in SJS/TEN Management : Involves immediate withdrawal of the offending drug. Cyclosporine, IV Immunoglobulins. Supportive care Erythema multiforme (Option A) is a less severe condition characterized by target-like lesions and typically involves less than 10% of the body surface area. While it may be triggered by medications or infections, it does not typically cause extensive epidermal detachment or mucosal involvement seen in TEN. Pemphigus vulgaris (Option C) is an autoimmune blistering disorder characterized by intraepidermal blistering due to autoantibodies targeting desmogleins 3> 1. It does not typically present with widespread epidermal detachment or mucosal involvement as seen in TEN.",

        "D": "Milia"
      },
      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer :C) Acute generalized exanthematous pustulosis Explanation : Acute generalized exanthematous pustulosis (AGEP) is a rare, acute hypersensitivity reaction caused in approximately 90 per cent of cases by drugs, most often antibiotics, calcium channel blockers, and antimalarials. AGEP is characterized by the development of numerous nonfollicular, sterile, small pustules on a background of edematous erythema with flexural accentuation. Fever above 38°C (100.4°F) and leukocytosis with a neutrophil count >7000/microL are usually present. The eruption usually occurs a few hours to a few days after the administration of the offending drug. The eruption resolves spontaneously in one to two weeks after the discontinuation of the offending drug Staphylococcal scalded skin syndrome (SSSS) (Option A ) also known as Ritter’s disease, the exfoliative toxin of Staphylococcus bacteria causes the characteristic flaccid, blisters and bullae, which are usually accentuated in the flexures. Pemphigus vulgaris (Option B) is an autoimmune disease caused by autoantibodies against desmogleins. It presents with flaccid blisters containing clear fluids, which can rupture to produce erosions. The Nikolsky sign is positive. Milia (Option D) are small, self-limiting, benign subepidermal keratin cysts. They are commonly seen in half of newborns and have little to no clinical relevance. They are most commonly present on the face but can occur anywhere on the skin. They heal without any scarring.",

      },
      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: C) Becker's nevus Explanation: Becker's nevus, (or Becker melanosis), is a hyperpigmented skin lesion, commonly seen in adolescent males. While hypertrichosis is frequently observed, it is not consistently present. Commonly found on the Shoulders and the upper trunk. Becker's nevus may also be associated with extracutaneous abnormalities, collectively referred to as Becker's nevus syndrome. These abnormalities can involve underlying structures such as aplasia or hypoplasia of breast tissue, pectoralis major muscle, or lipoatrophy. Option A: Seborrheic keratosis: It is a benign tumour that typically presents as a raised, wart-like lesion with a dull, waxy surface that gives it a characteristic 'stuck-on' appearance. It tends to occur in older individuals and is not associated with hyperpigmentation. Option B: Malignant melanoma Malignant melanoma is a tumour produced by the malignant transformation of melanocytes, characterized by the development of atypical moles or lesions. While it can present as a darkly pigmented patch, it often exhibits asymmetry, irregular borders, variation in colour, and changes in size over time. Additionally, malignant melanoma typically occurs in sun-exposed areas and is less likely to be associated with hypertrichosis. Option D: Nevus of Ito The Nevus of Ito manifests as a unilateral blue-greyish macular discolouration, often localized in the dermatomal distribution innervated by the posterior supraclavicular and lateral cutaneous brachial nerves. Histopathology shows numerous melanocytes in the dermis.",

      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: C) Urticaria Explanation: Urticarial lesions are intensely pruritic, circumscribed, raised, and erythematous plaques, often with central pallor. They are due to vasodilation and increased vascular permeability causing dermal edema. Mostly Mast cell-dependent Can also be Bradykinin mediated. Urticarial lesions typically develop over minutes to hours and resolve in hours to a day without residual markings. There may be accompanying angioedema, which is a non-pitting submucosal or subcutaneous oedema commonly seen in lips and eyelids. Classification: Urticaria is classified as either acute or chronic. Acute Urticaria Chronic urticaria Periodic outbreaks of urticarial lesions that resolve within six weeks. Urticaria that persists beyond six weeks Infections: Viral infections. Drugs: Penicillin, sulfa drugs. Ingestion: Food items Inhalation: Pollen. Idiopathic. Chronic spontaneous urticaria (autoimmune, pseudo allergic, infection, and idiopathic). Physical/ inducible urticaria. Urticarial vasculitis. Salient features of physical/inducible Urticaria: Management: 2nd generation antihistamines (Dose can be increased up to 4 folds.

      },
      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: C) Hereditary angioedema Explanation : Recurrent episodes of swelling, lack of rash (wheals) or itching, Difficulty breathing, and family history suggest a diagnosis of Hereditary angioedema. Hereditary angioedema: Hereditary angioedema (HAE) is a rare condition characterized by recurrent episodes of angioedema, without urticaria (also called wheals) or pruritus, which most often affects the skin or mucosal tissues of the upper respiratory and gastrointestinal tracts. The HAE arise from deficiency or dysfunction of the C1 inhibitor (C1-INH). The angioedema that occurs in HAE due to C1-INH deficiency (HAE-C1-INH) results from excessive production of bradykinin, a potent vasodilatory mediator. It is not histamine-mediated, hence there are no wheals associated. Types: Type 1: Deficiency in C1 inhibitor. Type 2: Defect in C1 inhibitor. Type 3: Normal levels and function of C1 inhibitor. Management: C1 inhibitor concentrate (plasma-derived) Recombinant C1 inhibitor Bradykinin B2-receptor antagonist: Icatibant Kallikrein inhibitor: Ecallantide Fresh frozen plasma. Aquagenic pruritus( Option A ) is a condition where a person experiences intense itching after coming into contact with water, regardless of temperature. The itching can occur on various body parts and typically presents without any wheals. This condition may be associated with underlying medical issues such as polycythemia vera Urticarial vasculitis ( Option B) is a chronic urticaria characterized by hives that last longer than 24 hours and leave behind bruising or hyperpigmentation when they resolve. This condition involves inflammation of small blood vessels (Leukocytoclastic vasculitis) in the skin. They are associated with connective tissue diseases and haematological malignancies. Anaphylaxis ( Option D) is an acute, life-threatening condition associated with urticaria, angioedema, hypotension, and bronchoconstriction.",
