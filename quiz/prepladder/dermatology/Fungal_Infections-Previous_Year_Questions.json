      "question": "A 60-year-old female with a great toe infection. She had a significant discoloration with a subungual hyperkeratosis that caused surface changes. She was suspected of onychomycosis. Which is the topical drug given in toenail onychomycosis?",
      "options": {
        "A": "Itraconazole",
        "B": "Tavaborole",
        "C": "Griseofulvin",
        "D": "Caspofungin"
      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: B) Tavaborole Explanation: Tavaborole is a topical oxaborole antifungal specifically approved for onychomycosis of the toenails. It inhibits fungal leucyl-tRNA synthetase, disrupting protein synthesis. Onychomycosis is the fungal infection of the toenail (Onymychosis) or Tinea Unguium . Clinically , onychomycosis presents with various manifestations, including Discoloration of the nails (yellow, brown, or white), Thickening of the nail plate, Subungual hyperkeratosis (build-up of keratin debris under the nail), Onycholysis (separation of the nail plate from the nail bed), Nail dystrophy (deformation of the nail) Diagnosis: typically involves microscopic examination using KOH and fungal culture of nail clippings. Treatment: Oral antifungals such as terbinafine and itraconazole are often preferred. Nail lacquers such as ciclopirox (applied daily) olamine and amirolfine (applied weekly) are also used as topical agents to treat onychomycosis. The table below describes the types of onychomycosis Distal lateral subungual onychomycosis Most common Primarily affecting the distal & lateral portions of the nail Proximal subungual onychomycosis Seen in individuals with HIV The proximal portion of the nail plate Superficial white onychomycosis Characterized by the presence of white, crumbly material on the surface of the nail, which can be easily scrapped off Total dystrophic onychomycosis Characterized by extensive involvement of the nail plate, leading to complete destruction & deformity of the nail Itraconazole (Option A): Oral antifungal – Used for onychomycosis but given systemically, not topically. Griseofulvin (Option C): Oral antifungal – Primarily used for dermatophytosis; less effective for toenail infections. Caspofungin (Option D): Echinocandin antifungal – Used for systemic fungal infections like invasive candidiasis, not for onychomycosis.",

      "question": "A 35-year-old patient presents to the OPD with a history of prolonged use of steroids for a skin condition. The patient complains of an expanding rash that has become less red and itchy since using the steroids. On examination, there are well-defined, slightly raised, erythematous plaques with central clearing and a scaly border on various parts of the body. What is the most likely diagnosis for this patient's condition?",
      "options": {
        "A": "Tinea incognito",
        "B": "Tinea corporis",
        "C": "Tinea cruris",
        "D": "Tinea pedis"
      },
      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "specifically tinea (ringworm), that have been modified or worsened due to the inappropriate use of topical steroids. In this case, the patient's history of prolonged steroid use has likely led to the modification of the typical clinical appearance of the fungal infection. The expanding rash, reduced redness and itchiness, well-defined slightly raised plaques with central clearing, and scaly border all point to tinea incognito. The use of steroids can mask the inflammatory response and alter the clinical presentation, making it challenging to recognize the underlying fungal infection. Incorrect options: Option B - Tinea corporis: Tinea corporis, also known as ringworm, is a fungal infection of the skin characterized by red, itchy, circular, or oval lesions with an active border and central clearing. While the patient's presentation does involve some elements seen in tinea corporis (such as well-defined plaques and central clearing), the fact that the patient has been using steroids and the alteration of the typical symptoms makes tinea incognito a more appropriate diagnosis in this case. Option C - Tinea cruris: Tinea cruris, commonly referred to as jock itch, is a fungal infection that affects the groin and inner thighs. It typically presents as red, scaly, and sometimes itchy lesions with well-defined borders. The patient's symptoms are not limited to the groin area, and the modification of symptoms due to steroid use suggests a different diagnosis. Option D - Tinea pedis: Tinea pedis, also known as athlete's foot, is a fungal infection affecting the feet. It can cause redness, itching, and scaling between the toes and on the soles of the feet. The patient's presentation involves lesions on various parts of the body and the modification of symptoms due to steroid use, which makes tinea incognito a more suitable diagnosis. Reference: .",

      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: C) Kerion Explanation: Clinical Presentation: Painful inflammatory swelling on the scalp . Chronic duration ( 3 months ). Associated with a pet dog , suggesting a zoophilic fungal infection . Classic Appearance: Boggy, pustular mass with crusting and hair loss . Purulent discharge . Seen in tinea capitis (Trichophyton species, Microsporum canis - from pets) . Most Likely Diagnosis: Kerion (inflammatory tinea capitis) Kerion and Tinea Capitis Variants Feature Kerion (Inflammatory Tinea Capitis) Non-inflammatory Tinea Capitis Cause Zoophilic fungi (Microsporum canis, Trichophyton mentagrophytes) Anthropophilic fungi (Trichophyton tonsurans) Appearance Boggy, pustular , inflammatory swelling Dry, scaly patches with black dots Hair loss Yes, scarring alopecia if untreated Yes, but non-scarring Pain/Discharge Painful , pus-filled lesions Painless, no pus Diagnosis KOH mount, Wood’s lamp (fluoresces with Microsporum) KOH mount, culture Treatment Oral griseofulvin or terbinafine , topical antifungals Oral antifungals , ketoconazole shampoo Furuncle (Option A): Incorrect because it is a bacterial infection (S. aureus) and lacks hair loss .

      "question": "Which type of alopecia is commonly associated with inflammatory alopecia in a 30-year-old male patient who presents with tinea capitis infection?",
      "options": {
        "A": "Endothrix and Favus",

      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: C) Favus and Kerion Explanation: Tinea capitis is a fungal infection of the scalp caused by dermatophytes (Trichophyton & Microsporum). Inflammatory variants of tinea capitis include: Kerion: Severe inflammatory reaction with pustules, abscesses, and hair loss. Favus: Chronic infection with yellow crusts (scutula) , leading to scarring alopecia. Types of Tinea Capitis and Alopecia Patterns Type Causative Organisms Hair Involvement Clinical Features Ectothrix Microsporum species Outside hair shaft Fluoresces under Wood's lamp Endothrix Trichophyton tonsurans Inside hair shaft No fluorescence Kerion Trichophyton verrucosum Inflammatory, patchy alopecia Boggy swelling, pustules Favus Trichophyton schoenleinii Permanent scarring alopecia Honeycomb scutula Endothrix and Favus (Option A): Incorrect because Endothrix does not cause an inflammatory response like Kerion or Favus . Ectothrix and Endothrix (Option B): Incorrect because Ectothrix is non-inflammatory , and Kerion is missing . Kerion and Endothrix (Option D): Incorrect because Endothrix infections are typically non-inflammatory , whereas Favus is a classic inflammatory type .",
