      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "Correct answer: A)Flaky paint dermatosis I IIIIII suggests the diagnosis of Kwashiorkor, a form of severe acute malnutrition characterized by oedema resulting from a deficiency of dietary protein despite sufficient caloric intake. This condition may present with peripheral pitting oedema, muscle atrophy, abdominal distension (hepatomegaly), moon facies, hair and skin changes, anorexia, apathy, and growth retardation. The skin manifestations are distinctive and often described as resembling \"cracked skin,\" \"peeling paint,\" \"enamel paint,\" \"flaky paint,\" or \"crazy paving\" due to the characteristic scaling and irregular fissures observed during examination.Over time, more defined plaques may develop, particularly in areas prone to friction such as skin folds. The hair frequently takes on a dull, reddish-brown hue that may alternate with more normal colouring, referred to as the \"flag sign.\" Inflammatory changes of the mucous membranes, such as xerophthalmia, cheilitis, stomatitis, and vulvovaginitis, may develop alongside other concurrent deficiencies in vitamins and mineral micronutrients. Treatment focuses on slowly restoring nutrients to prevent refeeding syndrome and related electrolyte imbalances and micronutrient deficiencies. Option B) Phrynoderma, derived from \"toad skin,\" is a dermatological manifestation linked to vitamin A deficiency, although it can also occur in conjunction with other nutritional deficiencies. Option C: Corkscrew hair represents fractured and coiled hairs due to disruption in the formation of keratin cross-links through disulfide bonds. It is commonly seen in deficiencies of vitamins C. Option D: Casal’s necklace is V-shaped eczematous, hyperkeratotic lesions on the anterior aspect of the neck, manifesting as a part of dermatitis in pellagra due to Vitamin B3 (Niacin) deficiency.

      "question": "A 45-year-old female presented to the dermatological OPD with complaints of painful cracks at the corners of her mouth. On examination, the doctor noticed a smooth magenta-coloured tongue. Which of the following supplements needs to be prescribed to the patient?",
      "options": {
        "A": "Thiamine",
        "B": "Methylcobalamin",
        "C": "Riboflavin",
        "D": "Folate"
      },
      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Correct answer: C) Riboflavin Explanation: Based on the clinical presentation of painful cracks at the corners of the mouth (angular stomatitis) and a smooth magenta-coloured tongue, the most likely deficiency is of Riboflavin (Vitamin B2). Vitamin B2 is a water-soluble B-complex vitamin. The recommended daily intake of riboflavin is 0.3–1.6 mg, depending on age and gender. A deficiency in riboflavin can arise due to reduced dietary consumption, impaired absorption, or exposure to phototherapy. Clinical presentations include angular stomatitis, cheilitis, glossitis, and Seborrhoeic dermatitis-like eruption. The ocular manifestation of riboflavin deficiency is corneal vascularization, which presents as itching and burning in the eyes and increased sensitivity to light. Treatment is with riboflavin supplementation of 1–2 mg/day in infants and children and 10–20 mg/day in adults. Option A) Thi amine: Thiamine (vitamin B1) deficiency primarily leads to a condition known as Beriberi, which is of two types: Wet beriberi has predominant cardiovascular involvement, including cardiomegaly and congestive heart failure. Dry beriberi causes neurological manifestations including peripheral neuropathy and Wernicke’s encephalopathy. It can result in the development of skin lesions, including patches of redness, scaling, or hyperpigmentation. Option B) Methylcobalamin: Vitamin B12 (Methylcobalamin) deficiency presents with haematological manifestations, including megaloblastic anaemia, and dermatological manifestations such as pallor, jaundice, hyperpigmentation, and angular cheilitis. Although B12 deficiency also causes angular cheilitis, riboflavin deficiency most commonly and primarily affects mucous membranes, which can result in the development of angular cheilitis. Option D)Folate Folate (vitamin B9) deficiency also presents with megaloblastic anaemia. While angular stomatitis and cheilitis are also seen in folate deficiency, the smooth magenta-coloured tongue is commonly associated with riboflavin deficiency.",

      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Correct answer: B) Zinc deficiency The infant in this clinical vignette with diarrhoea and peri-oral and peri-genital rashes is probably suffering from Acrodermatitis enteropathica due to zinc deficiency. It is an autosomal recessive disorder caused by a mutation in the gene SLC39A4 , which encodes the intestinal zinc transporter ZIP4 on enterocytes. The characteristic clinical triad of symptoms comprises diarrhoea, dermatitis, and alopecia. It presents with eczematous rash in periorificial, peri-genital, and acral areas. Onset is usually after 6 months of age (Weaning of the child). Treated with zinc supplements. Option A) Sc urvy Scurvy is caused by vitamin C deficiency, which manifestations involve the skin and oral cavity. Symptoms include bleeding gums, easy bruising, perifollicular haemorrhages (bleeding around hair follicles), corkscrew hair, petechiae, ecchymoses, delayed wound healing, and bone and joint aches. Option C)Atopic d ermatitis Atopic dermatitis is a pruritic inflammatory skin disorder that typically begins in infancy, often before the age of 2. The rash is marked by erythema, itchy papules, or papulovesicles that can progress to become excoriated and thickened (lichenified) and frequently have a flexural distribution. Option D) Iron deficiency Iron deficiency can result in reduced haemoglobin levels, leading to the pallor of the skin and mucous membranes. Brittle nails and Koilonychia (spoon-shaped nails) due to the thinning of nail plates can be seen. Iron deficiency may also contribute to hair loss or thinning of the hair.",

      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Correct answer: B) Fasting blood glucose Explanation: The image depicts the presence of asymptomatic, oval, dull-red papules over the shin with no history of trauma suggests that the patient might have Diabetic dermopathy and hence needs to be evaluated for diabetes mellitus with fasting blood glucose levels and HbA1c levels. Diabetes can lead to many skin manifestations such as Acanthosis nigricans, Diabetic dermopathy, Necrobiosis lipoidica, Granuloma annulare, Scleredema diabeticorum, Eruptive xanthomas, Bullous diabeticorum, Pruritus and diabetic bulla. Diabetic dermopathy initially presents as rounded, dull, red papules that progressively evolve over 1-2 weeks into well-circumscribed, atrophic, brown macules, which are distributed bilaterally. The pretibial area is commonly affected, but other bony prominences like forearms or lateral malleoli may also be involved. These patients often exhibit concomitant nephropathy, neuropathy, and retinopathy. Histological examination indicates that the pigmentation results from the dermal deposition of haemosiderin and melanin.",

      "correct_answer": "D",
      "explanation": "decarboxylase enzyme deficiency indicates that the likely diagnosis is Porphyria cutanea tarda (PCT). It is the most common porphyria, has a complex inheritance pattern, and is of three types: Type I (sporadic) Type II (familial ) Type III The enzyme deficiency is acquired and restricted to hepatocytes due to the inhibition of a normal UROD enzyme. The enzyme deficiency is hereditary, present in all tissues, and associated with a UROD gene mutation. Rare type and is characterized by a hereditary enzyme deficiency localized to the liver. The major risk factors are subclinical genetic hemochromatosis, hepatitis C infection, alcohol , and estrogens. Patients exhibit increased fragility of light-exposed skin, presenting with painful bullae formation, subsequent crusting, and resulting in atrophic scarring, milia, and alterations in pigmentation, either hyper- or hypopigmentation.",

        "D": "Skin tags are commonly associated with this condition"
      },
      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "Correct answer: A) Primarily caused by excessive melanin production in the affected areas pigmentation is due to hyperkeratosis; there is no increase in melanocytes or melanin production. Therefore, this statement is incorrect. Acanthosis nigricans is a velvety, darkening of the skin that usually occurs in intertriginous areas. It typically occurs in individuals younger than the age of 40 years and is associated with obesity, hypothyroidism, acromegaly, PCOS, insulin-resistant diabetes, and Cushing and Addison diseases. It manifests as asymptomatic, symmetrical darkening of the skin, particularly in the axillae, groins, sub mammary folds, and neck. Pathogenesis: Increased production of IGF-1 (Insulin-like growth factor 1). Acanthosis nigricans is of two types: Benign: Mild, localized, and associated with obesity, diabetes mellitus and other metabolic syndromes. Malignant: Rapid in onset, generalized, and associated with visceral malignancy like Adenocarcinoma of GIT (Option C). The goal of treatment is to treat the underlying disease; Keratolytics, such as topical retinoids and podophyllin can be used. Option B) It is a cutaneous marker for underlying metabolic abnormalities This statement is correct as Acanthosis nigricans is commonly seen in associated metabolic conditions like DM, obesity, metabolic syndrome, OCP use, and insulin resistance. Option D) Skin tags are commonly associated with this condition Acanthosis nigricans typically begins with asymptomatic darkening of the skin in the neck, axillae, and groin regions. Over time, these patches thicken and may lead to the formation of skin tags in the affected areas.",

        "D": "Paget's disease"
      },
      "correct_answer": "D",
      "explanation": "Correct answer: D) Paget's disease Explanation: The above clinical vignette suggests that the patient is suffering from Paget’s disease of the nipple. A progressive, marginated scaling or crusting of the nipple and areola due to invasion of the epidermis by malignant cells, which usually originate from an intraductal carcinoma of the breast. Unilateral eczematous lesions, with a typical well-demarcated border seen on the nipple. Biopsy shows characteristic Paget cells that are present in the stratum spinosum. Surgery should be carried out for carcinoma of the breast. Option A) Eczematous dermatitis Typically bilateral and not associated with nipple retraction or bleeding. Can present with a scaly, itchy rash and typically does not have well-demarcated borders Option B) Psoriasis Psoriasis is characterized by well-defined, scaly plaques but usually affects the skin elsewhere on the body and does not typically involve the nipple. Psoriasis would be characterized by hyperkeratosis, acanthosis, and Munro microabscesses, rather than the atypical Paget cells found in Paget’s disease. Option C) Mondor’s disease Mondor's disease manifests as thrombophlebitis of the superficial veins of the breast and anterior chest wall. A characteristic feature is the presence of a tender, thrombosed subcutaneous cord, often adherent to the skin.

      "explanation": "Correct answer: A) Henoch-Schönlein Purpura Explanation: The given clinical scenario and lab investigations support the diagnosis of Henoch-Schönlein Purpura. IgA vasculitis, formerly known as Henoch-Schönlein Purpura , primarily affects the small vessels of the joints, kidneys, gastrointestinal tract, and skin. Cutaneous findings include erythematous, urticarial papules, which may evolve into palpable purpura with haemorrhage within 24 hours. This condition typically involves the extensor aspect of limbs and buttocks but can also involve the trunk, hands, and face. Renal involvement: Gross/microscopic hematuria with proteinuria. Gastrointestinal involvement: Abdominal pain, gastrointestinal bleeding. Painful arthritis. Less common manifestations include pancreatitis, orchitis, neurological abnormalities, carditis, and pulmonary haemorrhage. Biopsy reveals IgA-containing immune complexes in the walls of small blood vessels. Treatment: In children, the condition is self-limiting whereas in adults, colchicine and steroids can be given. Option B) Systemic Lupus Erythematosus Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) can present with a variety of symptoms, including skin rashes and joint pain. Butterfly Rash (Malar Rash): A characteristic facial rash that appears as a butterfly-shaped erythematous rash across the cheeks and nose bridge. It often has a “slapped cheek” appearance. Discoid Rash: Chronic, disk-shaped lesions that are scaly and often appear on sun-exposed areas. These rashes can lead to scarring and are distinct from the malar rash. Option C) Rheumatic fever Rheumatic fever is associated with a history of streptococcal throat infection and primarily affects the heart, joints, and skin (e.g., erythema marginatum). Erythema Marginatum: This is a key dermatological feature of rheumatic fever, characterized by erythematous, ring-shaped lesions with a pale center and raised edges. Option D) Kawasaki disease Kawasaki disease typically presents with prolonged fever, erythematous rash, conjunctivitis, and mucosal changes (e.g., strawberry tongue) rather than purpura and joint swelling. It usually does not cause abdominal pain or blood in stools.",
