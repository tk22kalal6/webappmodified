        "C": "Dermatitis herpetiformis",
        "D": "Pemphigus foliaceus"
      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: B) Bullous Pemphigoid Explanation: Bullous Pemphigoid: In prodromal phase of Bullous Pemphigoid itchy eczematous lesions can be seen. The associated antibody is IgG. Direct immunofluorescence linear deposition shows IgG and C3. Hence, this option is correct. BP is a common subepidermal immunobullous disorder mainly affecting elder people. Autoantibodies against hemidesmosomal target proteins BP230(BPAG1) and BP180(BPAG2) which finally leads to bullae formation. It is characterised by a prodromal non bullous stage with pruritis which is followed by a bullous stage. The later has intense pruritus with tense blisters and vesicles. These blisters show a negative Nikolsky sign but a positive Bulla spread sign. The rupture of blisters leads to yellow or hemorrhagic crust formation, which later heal without any scar. Oral lesions can occur sometimes. HPE shows a subepidermal split with inflammatory infiltrate, immunofluorescence shows a linear binding of immunoglobulin (IgG and C3) at the dermo-epidermal junction. Topical and systemic steroids are the mainstay of treatment. Pemphigus vulgaris (Option A) PV is characterized by intraepidermal blistering and acantholysis (loss of cell-to-cell adhesion between keratinocytes). Immunofluorescence shows intercellular IgG (not linear staining at the basement membrane zone). The presence of subepidermal blisters here excludes PV. Dermatitis herpetiformis (Option C) DH is a gluten-sensitive enteropathy associated with deposition of IgA in the dermal papillae, not linear IgG or C3 at the basement membrane. DH typically shows granular IgA deposition in immunofluorescence and not the linear patterns seen here. Pemphigus foliaceous (Option D) PF is another type of pemphigus that features intraepidermal blistering and acantholysis but lacks subepidermal blistering. Immunofluorescence in PF typically shows intercellular IgG, not the linear IgG and C3 at the basement membrane observed in this case.",

      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: A) Pemphigus Vulgaris Explanation: Clinical Presentation: Flaccid bullae (easily rupturing blisters). Mucosal involvement is often present. Histopathology Findings: Suprabasal split (acantholysis within the epidermis). Row of tombstones appearance (basal keratinocytes remain attached to the basement membrane). Confirmatory Test: Direct Immunofluorescence (DIF): IgG deposition in an intercellular pattern. Most Likely Diagnosis: Pemphigus vulgaris (PV) . Pemphigus and Other Blistering Disorders Condition Blister Type Histopathology Immunofluorescence Pemphigus vulgaris Flaccid bullae, oral lesions Suprabasal split, acantholysis IgG in intercellular spaces (fishnet pattern) Pemphigus foliaceus (Option B ruled out) Superficial, crusted lesions Subcorneal split Similar IgG deposits Bullous pemphigoid Tense bullae, no mucosal involvement Subepidermal split Linear IgG at BMZ Dermatitis herpetiformis Grouped vesicles, pruritic Neutrophilic abscesses in dermal papillae IgA at dermal papillae Pemphigus vegetans (Option C): Incorrect because it presents with verrucous plaques rather than flaccid bullae. Erythema multiforme (Option D): Incorrect because it presents with target lesions , not bullous formations with acantholysis.

      },
      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer A - Epidermolysis bullosa Epidermolysis bullosa is a group of inherited disorders characterized by the formation of blisters and erosions on the skin and mucous membranes in response to minor trauma or friction. It is caused by defects in the proteins that help anchor the layers of the skin together. The fact that the baby's previous sibling had similar complaints and died at a young age further supports the diagnosis of a genetic disorder like EB, as it is an inherited condition. It has four main types : EB simplex, junctional EB, dystrophic EB, and Kindler syndrome . Pathophysiology Caused by mutations in genes encoding skin structural proteins (keratins, laminins, collagen). Leads to weakened dermal-epidermal adhesion , resulting in blister formation with minor friction or trauma. Features Fragile skin with fluid-filled blisters , erosions, and scarring. Mucosal involvement (oral, esophageal, ocular, and genitourinary). Severe forms can lead to deformities, malnutrition, and infections . Dystrophic EB may cause mitten-hand deformities due to fusion of digits. Investigations & Diagnosis Skin biopsy with immunofluorescence mapping – Identifies the defective protein. Genetic testing – Confirms mutation type. Electron microscopy – Assesses ultrastructural defects.

Congenital syphilis (Option C): While syphilis can cause skin manifestations, it typically presents with other symptoms as well and can be confirmed through specific diagnostic tests. Neonatal pemphigus (Option D): Neonatal pemphigus is a rare autoimmune condition in which autoantibodies are transferred from the mother to the baby, resulting in blistering.",

      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer B - Dapsone Dapsone is the treatment of choice for sub-epidermal blister formation with neutrophils located at the tips of the dermal papillae. This presentation is characteristic of a group of autoimmune blistering diseases known as subepidermal autoimmune bullous diseases, which include bullous pemphigoid and dermatitis herpetiformis. Mechanism of Action of Dapsone Inhibits neutrophil chemotaxis and reactive oxygen species (ROS) production , reducing blister formation. Suppresses inflammatory mediators , leading to decreased skin damage. Indications in Subepidermal Autoimmune Bullous Diseases Dermatitis Herpetiformis (DH) – First-line treatment Linear IgA Bullous Dermatosis (LABD) – Effective in most cases Bullous Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (BSLE) – Used in resistant cases Epidermolysis Bullosa Acquisita (EBA) – Occasionally used as adjunct therapy Incorrect Options: Rituximab (Option A) : Rituximab is not the treatment of choice for sub-epidermal blister formation with neutrophils located at the tips of the dermal papillae. Cyclosporine (Option C) : Cyclosporine can be effective in managing certain blistering diseases, it is not the treatment of choice Azathioprine (Option D) : Azathioprine may be beneficial in some cases of autoimmune blistering diseases, it is not the treatment of choice.

Histopathologically, pemphigus vulgaris shows suprabasal acantholysis, with the separation of keratinocytes above the basal layer of the epidermis as shown in the image. Incorrect Options : Option A - Psoriasis vulgaris: Histopathologically, psoriasis shows epidermal hyperplasia (thickening of the epidermis), elongation of rete ridges, and a characteristic inflammatory infiltrate composed of lymphocytes. Option B - Leishmaniasis: Histopathological findings in cutaneous leishmaniasis include a granulomatous inflammatory response with intracellular amastigotes (parasitic form) within macrophages. It does not involve intraepidermal blistering like pemphigus vulgaris. Option C - Mycosis fungoides: Histopathologically, mycosis fungoides show atypical lymphocytes infiltrating the epidermis (epidermotropism) and the presence of Pautrier microabscesses. Mycosis fungoides do not involve intraepidermal blistering like pemphigus vulgaris. Reference: Rook's Textbook of Dermatology",
