It is characterized by symptoms such as high fever, joint pain, muscle pain, headache, and rash. The development of pigmentation on the nose after taking NSAIDs can occur in chikungunya. Other symptoms, such as joint pain and fever support this diagnosis. Some other dermatological features associated with chikungunya include: Maculopapular rash: small, raised bumps on the skin. The rash can appear on the trunk, limbs, and face. It is usually non-itchy and may be accompanied by redness or discoloration of the skin. Erythema multiforme-like rash: characterized by target-shaped or iris-like lesions with concentric rings of color on the skin. It typically affects the extremities, including the hands and feet. Vesiculobullous lesions: Rarely, chikungunya can cause the formation of fluid-filled blisters or bullae on the skin. Desquamation: After the initial rash subsides, some individuals with chikungunya may experience desquamation Incorrect Options: Dengue (Option A) : The rash in dengue is often described as maculopapular or petechial and can appear on the trunk, limbs, and face.

      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: B) Sporothrix schenckii Explanation: The lesions described in the question, following a thorn prick, are suggestive of a condition known as sporotrichosis or rose gardener's disease. The characteristic feature of sporotrichosis is the distribution of the lesions along the lymphatic vessels. The infection typically starts as a small, painless bump or nodule at the site of the inoculation, and it then spreads along the lymphatic vessels, forming a chain of nodules or ulcers. Sporotrichosis Sporotrichosis is a chronic fungal infection caused by Sporothrix schenckii , commonly known as “rose gardener’s disease.” It occurs through trauma-induced inoculation from soil, plants, or organic matter. Pathophysiology Sporothrix schenckii is a dimorphic fungus that exists as a mold in the environment and yeast in human tissue . The fungus spreads via lymphatics , causing characteristic nodular lymphangitis . Features Cutaneous (most common) : Painless nodules and ulcers along lymphatic channels (lymphocutaneous form).

      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: B) KFD Explanation: The lesion described by a forest officer suggests an eschar-like lesion , which is commonly seen in scrub typhus, cutaneous anthrax, and brown recluse spider bites . KFD (Kyasanur Forest Disease) is a viral hemorrhagic fever caused by a Flavivirus , transmitted by ticks . It primarily affects forest workers but does not cause eschar formation . Instead, it presents with fever, myalgia, haemorrhagic manifestations, and meningoencephalitis . Kyasanur Forest Disease (KFD) is a tick-borne viral disease (Flavivirus) endemic to forests in South India . Transmission: By Haemaphysalis ticks from infected rodents, monkeys, and livestock. Monkey fever/Kyasanur forest disease: General features: Virus Characteristics : Enveloped virus belonging to the family Flaviviridae ; contains single-stranded RNA (ssRNA). Vector : Hard ticks (Haemaphysalis spinigera) Hosts : Monkeys, rodents, and squirrels are common hosts; monkeys act as amplifier hosts where the virus multiplies exponentially. Seasonality : KFD cases peak during dry months (November to June), coinciding with increased human activity in forests. The life cycle of Kyasanur forest disease Clinical features: Incubation Period: 3-8 days. First Stage (Hemorrhagic Fever): Acute high fever with malaise and frontal headaches. Hemorrhagic symptoms: bleeding from the nasal cavity, throat, gums, and gastrointestinal tract. Second Stage: Meningoencephalitis may occur 7–21 days after the first stage.

      },
      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "on the scalp with hair loss , suggestive of Tinea Capitis (scalp ringworm) . KOH (potassium hydroxide) mount is the gold standard for diagnosing superficial fungal infections , including Tinea Capitis , by detecting fungal hyphae in hair shafts and skin scrapings. Tinea Capitis: Caused by: Trichophyton and Microsporum species. Common in children , especially in warm, humid climates . Types: Non-inflammatory: Scaly patches with broken hairs . Inflammatory (Kerion): Painful, boggy swelling with pustules and crusting (as seen in the image). Diagnosis: KOH Mount: Detects fungal hyphae in hair shafts and skin scrapings . Fungal Culture: Confirms the fungal species. Wood’s Lamp Examination: Fluorescence in Microsporum infections. Management: Systemic antifungals (Griseofulvin or Terbinafine) for 6–8 weeks (topical antifungals alone are ineffective). Antifungal shampoos (ketoconazole or selenium sulfide) reduce fungal shedding . Kerion cases may need corticosteroids to reduce inflammation.

      "question": "A female patient presented with acne that is not resolving on oral isotretinoin and antibiotics therapy. Which of the following is the next best investigation?",

        "A": "Look for dietary triggers",
        "B": "Evaluate for hyperandrogenism",
        "C": "Check for antibiotic resistance",
        "D": "Look for drug triggers"
      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: B) Evaluate for hyperandrogenism Explanation: The patient presents with acne that is not responding to oral isotretinoin and antibiotics, which suggests that a more systemic or hormonal cause could be contributing to the acne. Hyperandrogenism is commonly associated with conditions like polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) and congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH) , both of which can lead to increased sebum production and hormonal imbalances , exacerbating acne. Evaluating for hyperandrogenism through tests like testosterone levels , dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate (DHEAS) , and other hormonal markers is crucial to rule out these underlying causes. Hyperandrogenism is when the body produces too much androgen, a male hormone. This can contribute to the development of acne in women and other symptoms such as hirsutism and irregular periods. Treatment may involve medications such as oral contraceptives or anti-androgen drugs. Look for dietary triggers (Option A): Acne can be affected by diet in some people, particularly those with a high glycemic index or a diet high in dairy products. However, this is typically considered after other causes of acne have been ruled out. Additionally, dietary changes may not be sufficient to treat acne on their own, but rather they can be used in conjunction with other treatments. Check for antibiotic resistance (Option C): Antibiotics are often used to treat acne, but over time, the bacteria that causes acne can become resistant to the antibiotics. If a patient's acne is not improving with antibiotics, checking for antibiotic resistance can help determine if a different treatment approach is needed. Look for drug triggers (Option D): Certain medications can contribute to the development of acne. For example, corticosteroids, anticonvulsants, and some hormonal medications can cause acne as a side effect. If a patient takes any medications that may increase the risk of acne, it is important to evaluate their treatment plan and consider alternative medications if necessary.

Treatment Antiviral therapy (acyclovir, valacyclovir, famciclovir) within 72 hours , analgesics, corticosteroids (if severe pain). Prevention Zoster vaccine for elderly and immunocompromised individuals. Irritant contact dermatitis (Option B) is incorrect because it results from direct skin damage due to chemical exposure , leading to erythema, scaling, and burning , rather than a vesicular dermatomal rash with neuropathic pain. Allergic contact dermatitis (Option C) is incorrect because it is a delayed hypersensitivity reaction (Type IV), presenting as itchy, erythematous, and vesicular plaques in areas of contact , but lacks dermatomal distribution and prodromal neuralgia .

The image shows multiple hypopigmented macules over the back, characteristic of PKDL . History of prolonged fever in childhood suggests prior kala-azar infection , which is a prerequisite for developing PKDL. No thickened nerves rule out leprosy. Post Kala-Azar Dermal Leishmaniasis (PKDL): PKDL is a chronic dermal complication of visceral leishmaniasis caused by Leishmania donovani . Endemic in India, Nepal, and Sudan , especially in Bihar, West Bengal, and Uttar Pradesh . Clinical Features: Occurs months to years after treated visceral leishmaniasis . Hypopigmented macules, erythematous papules, or nodules on the face, trunk, and extremities. No loss of sensation or thickened nerves (differentiating from leprosy). Histopathology: Presence of Leishman-Donovan (LD) bodies . Diagnosis: Slit-skin smear or skin biopsy showing Leishmania donovani bodies . PCR or rK39 serology can confirm diagnosis. Management: First-line treatment: Miltefosine for 12 weeks. Alternatives: Liposomal amphotericin B or paromomycin . Tuberculoid leprosy (Option A) is incorrect because it presents with single or few hypopigmented macules with loss of sensation . Thickened peripheral nerves are a hallmark feature, which is absent in this case. Lepromatous leprosy (Option B) is incorrect because it presents with multiple ill-defined hypopigmented macules with symmetric distribution . Thickened nerves and sensation loss are typical, but they are absent in this patient . Mycosis fungoides (Option C) is incorrect because it presents as erythematous scaly plaques rather than hypopigmented macules . It is a form of cutaneous",

      "explanation": "Correct answer: A) Herpes Zoster Explanation: The image shows a unilateral, dermatomal eruption of grouped vesicles on an erythematous base . The patient has painful lesions , which is a key feature of Herpes Zoster (Shingles) . The lesions appear in a band-like distribution , following the sensory nerve dermatome . Herpes Zoster (Shingles): Cause: Reactivation of Varicella-Zoster Virus (VZV) in the dorsal root ganglion. Risk Factors: Immunosuppression (HIV, malignancies) Elderly individuals Stress and trauma Clinical Features: Painful, grouped vesicles on an erythematous base in a unilateral dermatomal pattern . Pre-eruptive phase (burning, tingling pain) 48–72 hours before rash onset. Thoracic dermatomes are most commonly involved. Postherpetic neuralgia (persistent pain after healing) may develop in older adults. Diagnosis: Clinical, confirmed by Tzanck smear (multinucleated giant cells) or PCR for VZV DNA . Treatment: Antiviral therapy (Acyclovir, Valacyclovir) within 72 hours of rash onset. Analgesics for pain control. Corticosteroids in severe cases. Molluscum Contagiosum (Option B) is incorrect because Molluscum contagiosum presents as small, umbilicated, pearly white papules , not as vesicular eruptions . It is usually asymptomatic and not painful . Herpes Simplex (Option C) is incorrect because Herpes simplex virus (HSV) causes clusters of vesicles but does not usually follow a dermatomal distribution . HSV infections typically affect the oral (HSV-1) or genital (HSV-2) regions rather than the thoracic dermatomes . Lymphangioma Circumscriptum (Option D) is incorrect because lymphangioma circumscriptum is a benign lymphatic malformation , presenting as clusters of small, translucent vesicles (\"frog spawn\" appearance) . It is not painful and does not appear in a dermatomal pattern . Reference: Ananthanarayan and Paniker’s Textbook of Microbiology, 10th Edition, Pages 478, 479.",
