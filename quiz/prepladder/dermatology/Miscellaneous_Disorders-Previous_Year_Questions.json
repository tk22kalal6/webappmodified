        "C": "Polymorphous light eruption",
        "D": "Vitiligo"
      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer B - Dermatitis artefacta Dermatitis artefacta is a condition characterized by self-inflicted skin lesions, consciously or unconsciously caused by the individual. It is considered a psychiatric disorder rather than a primary skin disease. The lesions in dermatitis artefacta often have unusual or bizarre patterns and may not follow the typical distribution or characteristics of known dermatological conditions. These lesions may appear in unusual shapes, patterns, or locations that are not consistent with typical henna reactions or allergic contact dermatitis. Treatment involves a multidisciplinary approach involving dermatologists, psychologists, and psychiatrists to address the underlying psychological issues and provide appropriate care and support to the individual. In the case of henna application, if the child deliberately scratches or traumatizes the skin in the area where henna was applied, it can result in skin lesions that resemble a dermatitis reaction. The child may create patterns or designs by scratching the skin, leading to the appearance of lesions. Incorrect Options: Contact dermatitis due to henna (Option A) : Could be a possible differential diagnosis, as henna can sometimes cause an allergic reaction in certain individuals. However, in this case, the option \"dermatitis artefacta\" suggests that the",

      },
      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer C - Trichothiodystrophy Trichothiodystrophy is a rare genetic disorder that affects the structure of the hair. One of the characteristic features of Trichothiodystrophy is the presence of \"tiger tail banding\" when the hair is examined under polarized light microscopy. This term refers to alternating light and dark bands along the hair shaft, resembling the pattern of a tiger's tail. Trichothiodystrophy is primarily characterized by brittle hair that is prone to breakage and has a characteristic appearance under the microscope. Some key features of Trichothiodystrophy include: Brittle Hair Tiger Tail Banding Variable Hair Color Intellectual and Developmental Disabilities Additional features may include dry and scaly skin, brittle nails, photosensitivity (sensitivity to sunlight), and ocular abnormalities. Incorrect Options: Trichorhexis nodosa (Option A) : Trichorhexis nodosa is a hair shaft disorder characterized by nodules or nodes along the hair shaft. It does not typically show the specific \"tiger tail banding\" pattern seen in Trichothiodystrophy. Trichorexis invaginata (Option B) : Trichorexis invaginata, also known as \"bamboo hair,\" is a condition in which the hair shaft is characterized by multiple invaginations or nodules. It does not present with the specific banding pattern seen in Trichothiodystrophy. Monilethrix (Option D) : Monilethrix is a hereditary hair disorder characterized by beaded hair shafts that resemble a necklace. It does not show the specific \"tiger tail banding\" pattern seen in Trichothiodystrophy.

Psoriasis can affect any part of the body, but the scalp, elbows, knees, lower back, and genitals are the most common locations Incorrect choices: Option a -Atopic dermatitis A group of conditions known as neutrophilic dermatoses (NDs) are characterized by skin lesions for which a histological examination reveals a significant inflammatory infiltrate, primarily composed of neutrophils, without evidence of infection.Red, crusty, itchy, and flaky patches, resembling oval or circular patches on the skin, are typical manifestations of atopic dermatitis. Option c. Pemphigus vulgaris is an uncommon immune system problem that influences the skin and mucous layers. Painful blisters and sores form on the skin as well as inside the mouth, nose, and genital area, indicating this condition. Option d. Pemphigus foliaceus is a skin and mucous membrane-affecting autoimmune disease. The development of crusty, scaly lesions or blisters on the skin, particularly on the face, scalp, and chest, is a sign of this condition. An autoimmune reaction in which the immune system makes antibodies that attack the proteins that hold skin cells(desmoglein-1) together is what causes pemphigus foliaceus. Reference: ref",

      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "are commonly used in the management of keloids. Steroids, such as triamcinolone acetonide, are injected directly into the keloid to help reduce inflammation, shrink the scar tissue, and inhibit the overproduction of collagen. This can help prevent keloid recurrence after treatment. Incorrect Options: Option B: Surgery: This is an incorrect option. Surgical removal of a keloid can be performed, but it carries a risk of keloid recurrence, as the surgical incision itself can trigger the formation of new keloid tissue. Surgery alone is not usually sufficient to prevent keloid recurrence, and it is often combined with other treatments like steroid injections or radiation therapy. Option C: Cryotherapy: This is an incorrect option. Cryotherapy involves freezing the keloid with liquid nitrogen to destroy the abnormal tissue. While cryotherapy can be effective in reducing the size of the keloid, it may not address the underlying cause and is not considered the most reliable method for preventing keloid recurrence. Option D: Electrocoagulation: This is an incorrect option. Electrocoagulation involves using an electric current to destroy the keloid tissue. While it can be used as a treatment for keloids, it is not considered the primary method for preventing keloid recurrence. Reference: .",

Incorrect option: Option A. Melasma: Melasma is a common skin condition characterized by brown or gray patches on the face, particularly on the cheeks, forehead, and upper lip. It is not associated with fever or joint pain, so it is not the correct diagnosis in this case. Option B. Fixed drug eruption: Fixed drug eruption is a type of drug-induced skin reaction characterized by the development of well-defined, round or oval-shaped patches that recur in the same location each time the drug is taken. It typically presents as red or purplish lesions, but pigmentation on the nose is not a typical feature of fixed drug eruption. Option C.

      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "the body surface area is usually caused by drugs. This condition is known as Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS) or toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN). SJS and TEN are severe skin reactions that can be life-threatening. Both SJS and TEN are typically triggered by certain medications, most commonly antibiotics, anticonvulsants, and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). When a person has an adverse reaction to these medications, it can lead to widespread blistering and peeling of the skin, affecting more than 30% of the body surface area. Incorrect Options : Option A Viral infection: While certain viral infections can cause skin rashes and blistering, they are not typically associated with the extensive blistering and peeling of over >30% of the body surface area as seen in SJS or TEN. Viral infections that can cause skin rashes include herpes simplex virus, varicella-zoster virus (chickenpox and shingles), and measles, among others. Option C Fungal infection: Fungal infections generally do not cause the extensive blistering and peeling seen in SJS or TEN. Fungal infections of the skin, such as tinea infections (ringworm), typically present as red, scaly, and itchy patches on the skin, rather than blistering and peeling. Option D Autoimmunity: Autoimmune conditions can result in various skin manifestations, but they are not specifically associated with the extensive blistering and peeling seen in SJS or TEN. Autoimmune blistering disorders, such as pemphigus and bullous pemphigoid, may cause blistering, but they do not typically lead to the widespread involvement of over >30% of the body surface area.
