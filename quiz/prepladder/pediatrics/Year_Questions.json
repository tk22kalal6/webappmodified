      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: B) 20-24 months Explanation: Generally, a child's height at age 2 (20-24 months) years is half of their predicted adult height. This milestone is often used as a reference point in paediatrics to estimate the future growth potential of the child. Normal length at birth: 50cm. In the first year, there is an increase of 25cm, so at 1 year, the height is 75cm. In the second year, there is an increase of 10-15cm, so at 2 years, the height is 85-90cm. There is a steady increase of 6cm/year till 12 years. Height doubles by 4 years Height triples by 12 years Half of adult height in a normal child (80-85cm) is achieved by 2 years (18-24 months). AGE LENGTH/ HEIGHT At birth 50 cm By 3 months 60 cm By 9 months (Option C) 70 cm By 1 year (Option A) 75 cm At 2 years 90 cm At 4-4.5 years (Option D) 100 cm Reference: Ghai Essential pediatrics, 10th edition, Page: 12.",

      "question": "Following the delivery of a baby born to a mother with diabetes, the infant's blood glucose level was measured to be 60 mg/dl. What additional examination would you perform?",
      "options": {
        "A": "Serum potassium",
        "B": "CBC",
        "C": "Serum chloride",
        "D": "Serum calcium"
      },
      "correct_answer": "D",
      "explanation": "(low blood sugar) due to various factors, including high insulin levels in response to maternal hyperglycemia. Hypoglycemia in newborns can have significant consequences and requires careful management. While a blood glucose level of 60 mg/dl indicates hypoglycemia in the infant, additional investigations are necessary to assess the overall metabolic status and potential complications. Among the options provided, serum calcium (option D) is the most relevant investigation to consider in this scenario. Option A: Serum potassium While alterations in electrolyte levels can occur in infants of diabetic mothers, serum potassium is not the most relevant investigation to perform immediately after observing a low blood glucose level. Hypokalemia (low potassium levels) can occur in various conditions, but in this specific case, assessing serum calcium is more important. Option B: CBC (Complete Blood Count) A complete blood count may provide information about the infant's overall blood cell counts, including red blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets. While it is a useful investigation in many clinical scenarios, it is not directly relevant to evaluating and managing hypoglycemia in this case. Option C: Serum chloride Serum chloride levels are not typically the primary concern when assessing an infant's metabolic status in the context of hypoglycemia. Therefore, it is not the most appropriate investigation to prioritize in this scenario. Reference: NELSON Textbook Of Pediatrics 21st Edition",

      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "Alarm When it detects the moisture as the child passes urine, it wakes the child. With time, the child gains the awareness to recognize and respond to the sensation of a full bladder, leading to control over bedwetting. A bed alarm is most commonly recommended as the first line of treatment for bed wetting. Incorrect Options: Option B - Imipramine: Imipramine is recommended when the bed alarm fails to show any result. Option C - Desmopressin nasal spray: Desmopressin nasal spray is no longer licensed for bedwetting due to an increased incidence of side effects. Option D - Fludrocortisone : Fludrocortisone is not used to treat bed-wetting. Reference: Nelson Textbook of Pediatrics 21st edition",

Pyelonephritis (Option A) , Glomerulonephritis (Option C) , and IgA nephritis ( Option D) do not exhibit eosinophilic casts in the urine. Causes of Eosinophiluria: Atheroembolic kidney disease Acute kidney injury due to fragmentation of atherosclerotic plaque while performing coronary angiography causes fragments to get trapped in the renal artery. Renal function tests are deranged, post coronary angiography, and there is the presence of purpura all over the body of the patient. Development of gangrene of toes post angiography.

      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: B) Midstream catch Explanation: In a toilet-trained child, the usual method of collecting urine for evaluation of urinary tract infection is midstream catch . This is preferred since it poses the least risk of contamination and is easy and non-invasive. Methods of Urine Sample Collection: Midstream Sample (Toilet-Trained Children): Suitable for most toilet-trained children. Clean the introitus before collecting the sample. Voided Sample (Uncircumcised Males): Prepuce must be retracted to avoid contamination. Non-retractable prepuce can lead to unreliable, contaminated samples. Catheterized or Suprapubic Aspiration (Children Not Toilet-Trained): Preferred methods for children under 2 years old. Adhesive Collection Bag: Can be used in children not toilet-trained if the skin is disinfected. Useful for negative urinalysis or culture; has a 99% negative predictive value. Not recommended if immediate treatment is planned due to high contamination risk. Suprapubic Aspirate : (Option C) Rarely needed; generally not recommended unless there are specific concerns. Contamination Concerns: Bagged Specimen: Positive cultures can result from contamination, especially in females and uncircumcised males. Contamination Risk: A high rate of contamination may occur, especially with mixed organisms. The early morning sample (Option A) is for evaluating proteinuria and not UTI. Starting stream collection (Option D) is not preferred as this can contain commensals that might give incorrect results. Reference: Nelson Paediatrics, 21st Edition, Page 2792",

      "question": "A 3-year-old boy who presents with repetitive episodes of urinary tract infection. The mother reports that he urinates frequently but has a weak urinary flow and dribbling of urine. Upon examination, a palpable bladder is detected. What is the most sensitive investigation that can be employed to determine the underlying diagnosis?",

        "C": "Urine routine examination",
        "D": "DMSA scan"
      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: B) Micturating Cystourethrography Explanation: The clinical presentation of frequent urination, weak stream, dribbling and palpable bladder with recurrent UTIs indicates urinary tract obstruction due to vesicoureteral reflux (VUR). Micturating cystourethrography (MCU) is the most sensitive investigation for diagnosing vesicoureteral reflux (VUR). MCU is a specialized radiological study that involves filling the bladder with contrast material and taking X-ray images during urination, allowing visualization of the bladder outline, urethra, and detection of any retrograde flow of urine into the ureters (vesicoureteral reflux). It is also used to diagnose posterior urethral valves and neurogenic bladder. Vesicoureteral reflux (VUR) Definition Retrograde flow of urine from the bladder to ureters and pelvis at rest or during micturition Epidemiology Present in 30-35% of children with febrile UTI Conventionally considered a major risk factor for acute pyelonephritis and reflux nephropathy Can cause morbidity during pregnancy Diagnostic Methods Primary Methods: Radionuclide MCU (more sensitive for detecting VUR) Direct or indirect radionuclide cystography Regular radiologic imaging every 24-36 months for grades III-IV VUR Additional Techniques: Contrast-enhanced ultrasound MR urography Urinalysis and urine cultures (if symptomatic) Follow-up Monitoring: Weight and blood pressure measurements Periodic radiologic cystogram Prophylactic Antibiotics Medications and Dosages: Amoxiciilin: 10-12.5 mg/kg/day Nitrofurantoin: 1-2 mg/kg/day Cephalexin: 10-12.5 mg/kg/day Cefadroxil: 5 mg/kg/day Special Considerations: Avoid cotrimoxazole in infants <3 months, and those with G6PD deficiency Avoid nitrofurantoin in <3 months, G6PD deficiency, renal insufficiency Cephalexin is the drug of choice in the first 3-6 months of life Cefadroxil is an alternative agent in early infancy Management Approach For Low Grade VUR (I-II): With UTI: Consider antibiotic prophylaxis and Bladder-Bowel dysfunction management Without UTI: No therapy needed For High Grade VUR (III-IV): With BBD: Antibiotic prophylaxis until BBD resolves, manage BBD Without BBD: Antibiotic prophylaxis until age 2 and >1-yr UTI-free Additional Considerations: Medical therapy based on the principle that VUR resolves over time Prophylactic antibiotics maintain sterile urine and prevent UTI while awaiting resolution Surgical correction indicated for breakthrough infections or parenchymal injury Treatment Guidelines Consider dietary modification and medications Some patients require bladder retraining, anticholinergic medications Clean intermittent catheterization may be needed Liberal fluid intake recommended Regular and complete bladder emptying is important Avoid constipation Close follow-up for breakthrough UTI Outcomes Tends to resolve by 10 years of age Resolution rate 70-90% for grades I-III 10-35% resolution for higher grades Better outcomes with: younger age, lower grades, unilateral VUR Ultrasonogram (Option A) is useful as an initial screening tool to visualize kidney size, shape, and hydronephrosis. However, it is not the most sensitive as it cannot provide detailed information about urinary flow dynamics or definitively diagnose",
