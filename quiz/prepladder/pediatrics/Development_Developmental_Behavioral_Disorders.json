      },
      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "needed. Correct Answer: C) Behavioral therapy with positive reinforcement and using a bladder alarm if needed. Explanation: Nocturnal enuresis Definition Involuntary urination during sleep past the age of 5 years, with near-complete bladder emptying occurring at least twice a month for 3 months. Prevalence More common in males than females. Types Primary Monosymptomatic Nocturnal Enuresis: Present since birth without additional symptoms. Secondary Nocturnal Enuresis: Occurs after being dry at night for at least 6 months; may be due to UTIs, diabetes, stress, or bowel-bladder dysfunction. Polysymptomatic Enuresis: Includes lower urinary tract symptoms like hesitancy, urgency, or dribbling. Causes Delayed Bladder Maturation: Immaturity in nighttime bladder control. Reduced ADH Secretion: Decreased antidiuretic hormone production at night. Genetic Factors: Family history increases risk. Organic Factors: UTIs, constipation, structural urinary tract abnormalities. Sleep Disorders: Includes obstructive sleep apnea. Stress and Emotional Factors: Stressful events or emotional issues. Management Behavioral Modifications: Reassurance. Encourage voiding before bed. Restrict evening fluid intake (40% in the morning, 40% at noon, 20% after 6 PM). Avoid caffeinated drinks. Motivational Therapy: Use verbal praise and rewards for dry nights. Alarm Therapy: Use alarms that alert when the child starts to urinate, to condition recognition of a full bladder. Medication: Short-Term: Oral desmopressin for immediate relief. Long-Term: Oxybutynin or tolterodine to reduce bladder contractions. Imipramine is avoided due to side effects. Initiate treatment with desmopressin as the first-line treatment (Option A). Desmopressin is typically reserved for cases resistant to initial behavioral interventions. Comprehensive evaluation including urine culture, renal ultrasound, and voiding studies (Option B). In cases of primary monosymptomatic nocturnal enuresis, detailed investigations such as urine cultures and renal ultrasounds are usually not necessary unless there are additional signs or symptoms suggesting a possible underlying condition. Refer to a specialist for a psychological assessment (Option D). Psychological stressors can contribute to enuresis, primary monosymptomatic nocturnal enuresis is not usually caused by psychological issues alone.

      },
      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "individual, with medication if necessary. Correct Answer: C) Implementation of behavioral interventions and psychotherapy tailored to the individual, with medication if necessary. Explanation: ADHD management Management Approach Psychotherapy: The primary approach involves tailored psychotherapy for individuals and their families. Medication: Considered if psychotherapy alone is insufficient. Behavioral Interventions Behavioral Parent Training: Training for parents to manage ADHD-related behaviors effectively. Combined Training Interventions: Integrates multiple behavioral strategies. Behavioral Classroom Management: Techniques to manage behavior in the classroom setting. Behavioral Peer Interventions: Strategies to improve interactions with peers. Organization Training: Focuses on improving executive functions such as organization and planning. Medication Categories Stimulants: Boost the central nervous system, enhancing neurotransmitters like dopamine and norepinephrine. Examples: Methylphenidate (Option A) , Amphetamine, Dexmethylphenidate . Alpha-2 Agonists: Used alone or with stimulants to regulate norepinephrine for managing symptoms. Examples: Clonidine,Guanfacine. Selective Norepinephrine Reuptake Inhibitors (SNRIs): Primarily for depression but also used for ADHD by increasing norepinephrine levels. Example: Atomoxetine Atypical Antidepressants: Considered if ADHD co-occurs with other conditions like depression or anxiety. Examples: Bupropion, Mirtazapine. Tricyclic Antidepressants (TCAs): Less commonly used ,but may be an option if other treatments fail. Example: Imipramine Monitoring and Adjustments Regular medical monitoring is crucial to manage side effects and adjust dosages. Intensive cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) as the sole treatment option (Option B). CBT can be an effective component of ADHD treatment, it is not usually the sole approach. Referral to a specialist for neurological evaluation before starting treatment (Option D). Comprehensive neurological evaluation is not the standard first step in ADHD management.

Definition Children aged 4 to 18 years with academic or behavioral problems and symptoms of inattention, hyperactivity, and impulsivity. Diagnosis Based on DSM-5 criteria: Onset up to age 12; symptoms must occur in at least two settings and interfere with functioning. Symptoms: Inattention Hyperactivity impulsivity Management Psychotherapy tailored to the individual and family. If psychotherapy is insufficient, medications like methylphenidate and atomoxetine may be used. Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) (Option A) : ASD involves impaired communication and social reciprocity, it is usually characterized by symptoms present before the age of 3, and includes stereotypic and restrictive behaviors. Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD) (Option B) : GAD primarily involves excessive anxiety and worry about various aspects of life, including academic performance Specific Learning Disability (SLD) (Option C) : SLD involves difficulties with academic skills such as reading (dyslexia), writing (dysgraphia), or math (dyscalculia); it does not typically include symptoms of hyperactivity and impulsivity.

        "D": "Initiation of anticonvulsant medication to prevent further episodes."
      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Correct answer: B) Reassure and educate about the disease. Explanation: Breath holding spells Age and onset Reflex event, lasts usually for about 2 minutes Begins around 6 months of age Peaks by 2 years; often resolves by 5 years Sequence of Events Triggered by anger, frustration, or pain ↓ Leads to crying ↓ Breath holding follows a full expiration Types 1. Cyanotic Type Most common Increased sympathetic activity Child turns cyanotic (bluish) May develop tonic-clonic movements Recovers in a few seconds 2. Pallid Type Increased parasympathetic activity. Child becomes pale, mimicking syncope. Lasts for a few seconds. If prolonged, ECG may be done to rule out long QT syndrome. Management Reassure about the benign nature of the disease. During a seizure like episode: place the child laterally to avoid aspiration. Do Not pick up a child during an episode-can lead to spontaneous reduced cerebral flow. Main differences between Breath holding and Cardiac involvement for a pallid type Breath-Holding Spells Cardiac Involvement Typical Duration Generally lasts less than 2 minutes. May last longer than 2 minutes (Option A) Symptoms Brief loss of consciousness, pallor, or cyanosis. May include chest pain, irregular heartbeats, or prolonged symptoms. Resolution Resolves spontaneously as the child starts breathing again. May require medical intervention to restore heart function. When to Investigate If the spell exceeds 2 minutes or has atypical symptoms, further evaluation is necessary. Persistent or atypical symptoms should prompt investigation. Management Reassure and educate about the benign nature of the disease. Manage according to the diagnosis. Administration of oral iron supplements to address possible iron deficiency anemia (Option C). Breath-holding spells are not typically related to iron deficiency anemia. The primary management for breath-holding spells focuses on reassurance and education. Initiation of anticonvulsant medication to prevent further episodes (Option D) , anticonvulsant medications are not typically used to treat breath-holding spells.

      "explanation": "Correct Answer: B) Rett Syndrome Explanation : The above features are suggestive of Rett syndrome. Rett syndrome: Caused by mutations in the MECP2 gene with X-linked dominant inherit More common in girls and begins between 6-18 months of age after a period of normal development. Loss of previously acquired skills, such as purposeful hand movements and speech. Motor Abnormalities : Includes repetitive hand movements (e.g hand-wringing), gait disturbances, and motor impairments. Cognitive Impairment : Progressive cognitive decline, leading to severe intellectual disability. Communication Issues : Significant impairment in communication abilities. Autonomic Dysregulation : Breathing abnormalities (e.g hyperventilation or hypoventilation) Behavioral Symptoms : Social withdrawal and anxiety. Neurological Findings: Seizures are common and have acquired microcephaly . Asperger syndrome (Option A) : Asperger Syndrome typically have average to above-average intelligence and may have strong verbal skills, but they often experience challenges with social interactions and exhibit restricted or repetitive behaviors and interest. Cerebral Palsy (Option C) : Results in motor impairment and does not involve a period of normal development followed by skill loss. ADHD (Option D) : Characterized by inattention, hyperactivity, and impulsivity but does not feature the loss of acquired skills or the repetitive hand movements seen in Rett syndrome.",

      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "birth weight suggests Congenital Hypothyroidism. Congenital Hypothyroidism presents with features like: Hypotonia : Low muscle tone due to inadequate thyroid hormone levels. Poor Feeding : Infants with congenital hypothyroidism often have difficulty feeding, which can result in poor weight gain. Developmental Delays : Delay in reaching developmental milestones is common, including motor and cognitive delays. Congenital hypothyroidism can be associated with intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR) , leading to a low birth weight. Down Syndrome (Option A) : While Down syndrome can cause developmental delays, it usually presents with characteristic features such as hypotonia and distinct facial dysmorphisms, and it is not specifically associated with low birth weight. Cerebral Palsy (Option C) : This condition often results from brain injury and might present with hypotonia, but it typically becomes apparent later and is less likely to be the cause of poor feeding and low birth weight at 6 months. Fragile X Syndrome (Option D) : This genetic disorder leads to developmental delays and behavioral issues but does not usually cause hypotonia or poor feeding in the early months of life. Causes of developmental delay: Antenatal Causes Fragile X syndrome Rett syndrome Down syndrome Cortical malformations TORCH group infections Inborn errors of metabolism William syndrome Noonan syndrome Perinatal Causes Hypoxic ischemic encephalopathy Kernicterus Encephalitis Hypoglycemic brain injury Hypothyroidism Postnatal Causes B12,B1 and Iodine deficiency Lead toxicity Reference: Ghai Essential paediatrics, 10th edition, Page 42 Congenital Hypothyroidism",

      "options": {
        "A": "Sequence of attainment of milestone is same in all children",
        "B": "Disorganized mass activity is replaced by specific actions",
        "C": "Primitive reflexes have to be lost before relevant milestone are attained",
        "D": "The process of development progresses from toe to head."
      },
      "correct_answer": "D",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: D) The process of development progresses from toe to head. Explanation: Development is a continuous process, starting in utero and progressing in an orderly manner until maturity. Development depends on the functional maturation of the nervous system. Maturity of the Nervous system is essential for a child to learn a particular milestone or skill. The sequence of attainment of milestones is the same in all children. Variation may exist in the time and manner of their attainment. The process of development progresses in a cephalocaudal direction. Head control proceeds trunk control. Certain primitive reflexes have to be lost before relevant milestones are attained. Eg. Asymmetric tonic neck reflex has to disappear to allow the child to turnover. The initial disorganized mass activity is gradually replaced by specific actions. Eg. When a bright toy is shown to a 3 to 4 month old child, the child sequels loudly and moves all limbs in excitement, whereas a 3 to 4 year old may just smile and ask for it.

      "question": "During a developmental check-up, a pediatrician observes a group of toddlers at a local playgroup. The children are engaged in playing with toys independently but are situated close to one another. Each child seems focused on their own activity, occasionally glancing at the others but not interacting directly.At what age is this type of play most commonly observed?",
      "options": {
        "A": "6 months",
        "B": "1 years",
        "C": "2 years",
        "D": "4 years"
      },
      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: C) 2 years Explanation: Parallel play occurs in children aged 2 years, where they play side by side with similar toys but without direct interaction. They enjoy the presence of others but do not engage in shared activities or communication. This stage is important for developing social skills, as children begin to recognize others' feelings and thoughts. For example, if one child gets hurt, another may seek help, showing early signs of empathy. As they grow, children move from parallel to cooperative play, where they start sharing, collaborating, and learning essential social skills like empathy, negotiation, and turn-taking.
