      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "and exhibits progressive enlargement or expansion over time. It is a specific type of skull fracture that can be observed in young children, typically under the age of 3, due to the unique characteristics of their developing skull. In the scenario provided, a 2-year-old child with a history of a fall and parietal bone fracture one year ago now presents with painful and growing parietal swelling. This clinical presentation is consistent with a growing fracture. Incorrect Option Option A. Growing scalp hematoma: A growing scalp hematoma refers to an expanding collection of blood beneath the scalp, typically resulting from trauma. It is characterized by the progressive enlargement of the hematoma. However, in this scenario, the history of a previous parietal bone fracture suggests a more specific diagnosis of a growing fracture rather than a hematoma. Option C. Subdural hygroma: A subdural hygroma is the accumulation of cerebrospinal fluid in the subdural space of the brain. It typically occurs as a result of trauma or other pathological conditions. While trauma can be associated with both growing fractures and subdural hygromas, the clinical presentation of a painful and growing parietal swelling in this case is more consistent with a growing fracture. Option D. Chronic abscess: A chronic abscess refers to a long-standing collection of pus caused by infection. It is less likely in this scenario, as the presentation of a painful and growing parietal swelling is not indicative of an abscess. Reference: NELSON Textbook Of Pediatrics 21st Edition",
