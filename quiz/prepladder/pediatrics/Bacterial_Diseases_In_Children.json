      "question": "A 3-month-old unimmunized infant presents with a history of severe paroxysms of coughing, which are often followed by a high-pitched inspiratory sound and occasional vomiting. The parents report these symptoms have persisted for 2 weeks. Based on these symptoms, which drug is recommended for management?",
      "options": {
        "A": "Azithromycin",
        "B": "Erythromycin",
        "C": "TMP-SMX",
        "D": "Penicillin"
      },
      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: A) Azithromycin Explanation: The infant’s symptoms (severe coughing spells with a \"whoop\" and vomiting) are classic for pertussis (whooping cough). Azithromycin is the recommended first-line antibiotic for all age groups, including infants, for both treatment and post-exposure prophylaxis of pertussis. It is preferred over other macrolides due to a lower risk of side effects, such as infantile hypertrophic pyloric stenosis (IHPS), which is more commonly associated with erythromycin (Option B) , especially in infants younger than 14 days. TMP-SMX (Option C) : Alternative for infants >2 months if azithromycin is not suitable. Pertussis Causative agent Bordetella pertussis, Bordetella parapertussis Secondary attack rate 100% Clinical Stages Catarrhal (1-2 weeks): Cold-like symptoms, worsening cough Paroxysmal (2-6 weeks): Severe cough, \"whoop\", vomiting Convalescent (1-4 weeks): Recovery Complications Apnea, Otitis media, Pneumonia, Pulmonary hypertension, Cardiogenic shock, Hemorrhage, Seizures, hernia and malnutrition. Diagnosis Clinical signs, nasopharyngeal swab culture, PCR, serology. Differential Diagnosis Adenoviral infection, TB, foreign body inhalation, airway compression. Management First-line antibiotics for treating pertussis: Azithromycin is the first-line treatment for pertussis in all age groups. (option A) Erythromycin and clarithromycin are alternative treatments but are not recommended in <1 month old due to risk for IHPS. Alternative antibiotics: For patients allergic to macrolides or there is unavailability of azithromycin, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMX) may be used, but it is C/I in <2 months old (due to the risk for kernicterus) Timing of treatment: Antibiotics are most effective during the catarrhal stage Isolation: Patients diagnosed with pertussis should be isolated from others, especially vulnerable populations like infants and the elderly, for at least 5 days after starting antibiotics . Prevention DTaP vaccine (Diphtheria, Tetanus, and Pertussis): Given to children under 7 years of age as part of",

      "question": "A 6-day-old newborn presents with difficulty feeding, excessive crying and muscle stiffness. The mother reports that the umbilical cord was cut with an unsterilized blade at home. The baby has spasms triggered by touch. Which of the following is the most appropriate initial management step?",
      "options": {
        "A": "Immediate administration of tetanus toxoid (TT)",
        "B": "Administration of human tetanus immunoglobulin (TIG)",
        "C": "Intravenous administration of broad-spectrum antibiotics",
        "D": "Surgical debridement of the wound"
      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: B) Administration of human tetanus immunoglobulin (TIG) Explanation: In a patient presenting with typical symptoms of tetanus , such as difficulty feeding, excessive crying, muscle stiffness and spasms triggered by touch , WHO recommends the immediate administration of human tetanus immunoglobulin (TIG) , which is crucial to neutralize the circulating tetanus toxin. The diagnosis of Tetanus is mostly clinical, and routine laboratory studies are usually normal. The spatula test is a bedside diagnostic test that is highly sensitive and specific for tetanus, where a spatula or tongue blade is touched to the oropharynx. Normally, this elicits a gag reflex, causing the patient to expel the spatula. In tetanus, the patient reflexively bites the spatula due to masseter muscle spasm, indicating a positive test. Management of Tetanus in Symptomatic Patients A serum antibody titer of ≥ 0.01 U/mL is considered protective. Management Step Comments Human Tetanus Immunoglobulin (TIG) (Option B) Neutralizes circulating toxin; Given immediately. If TIG is not available, Human IVIG is given. Tetanus Toxoid (Option A) Provides immunity; complete course of tetanus toxoid given once recovered. Broad-Spectrum Antibiotics (e.g., Metronidazole, Penicillin) (Option C) Metronidazole is the antibiotic of choice. Parenteral penicillin G is an alternative treatment. Total duration: 7-10 days Wound Debridement (Option D) Reduces bacterial load and toxin production An Arthus-type hypersensitivity reaction or a fever >39.4°C (103°F) after a dose of tetanus toxoid-containing vaccine, often associated with high serum tetanus antitoxin levels, indicates localized vasculitis from immune complex deposition. Such individuals should not receive Td more frequently than every 10 years, even with a significant tetanus-prone injury. Reference: Nelson Textbook of Pediatrics, 21st Edition, Page 1550, 1551.

      "explanation": "Correct Answer: B) Causes skin scarring and limb hypoplasia. Explanation: Congenital varicella syndrome (CVS) is characterized by cicatricial zigzag skin scarring in a dermatomal pattern and limb hypoplasia. Congenital Varicella Transmission Results from in utero transmission of varicella-zoster virus (VZV). Incidence Occurs in 0.4% of infants born to women who have varicella before 13 weeks of gestation. (Option A) 2% of those born to women with varicella between 13 and 20 weeks of gestation. Clinical Features Cicatricial zigzag skin scarring in a dermatomal pattern Limb hypoplasia (Option B) Neurological issues: Microcephaly Cortical atrophy Seizures Mental retardation Eye problems: Chorioretinitis Microphthalmia Cataracts Renal issues: Hydroureter Hydronephrosis Autonomic nervous system issues: Neurogenic bladder Swallowing dysfunction Aspiration pneumonia Low birth weight. Diagnosis Based on a history of maternal varicella. Presence of characteristic abnormalities in the newborn. Viral DNA can be detected using polymerase chain reaction (PCR) in tissue samples. VZV IgM antibodies may be found in cord blood, though these are not always reliable. (Option D) Ultrasound may help identify limb atrophy. Treatment VZV-specific immune globulin (VZIG) and acyclovir may be administered to the mother to reduce disease severity, but their impact on fetal outcomes is uncertain. Antiviral treatment of infants with CVS is not indicated as the damage caused by fetal VZV infection does not progress after birth. (Option C) Image congenital varicella\" data-author=\"A.

        "D": "Penicillin for 30 days before delivery"
      },
      "correct_answer": "D",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: D) Penicillin for 30 days before delivery Explanation: Penicillin is the recommended treatment for syphilis during pregnancy (Option D) , if clinical or serologic findings indicate active syphilis, or if active infection cannot be confidently ruled out. It is crucial to initiate treatment at least 30 days before delivery, not 2 weeks (Option C) to effectively prevent congenital syphilis. Doxycycline and tetracycline should not be given during pregnancy. (Options A and B) Pregnant women allergic to penicillin should undergo desensitization and then be treated with penicillin. Macrolides are not effective in preventing fetal infection. Women who were previously treated adequately do not require further therapy unless there is a 4-fold increase in titer, indicating possible reinfection. Congenital syphilis, caused by Treponema pallidum , occurs through the transplacental transmission of spirochetes or, less commonly, through direct contact with infectious lesions during childbirth. Women with primary or secondary syphilis and spirochetemia have a higher likelihood of passing the infection to the fetus compared to those with latent infection. Kassowitz law states that “if a woman with untreated syphilis has a series of pregnancies, the likelihood of infection of the fetus in later pregnancies becomes less”. Transmission can happen at any stage of pregnancy, leading to outcomes such as early fetal loss, preterm birth, low birth weight, stillbirth, neonatal death, or infants born with congenital syphilis. Clues Suggesting Diagnosis of Congenital Syphilis Epidemiologic Background Untreated early syphilis in the mother Untreated latent syphilis in the mother Mother has contact with a known syphilitic during pregnancy and remains untreated Mother treated less than 30 days prior to delivery Mother treated with a non-penicillin drug for syphilis during pregnancy Mother treated for syphilis during pregnancy but lacks follow-up demonstrating a 4-fold decrease in titer Mother coinfected with HIV Reference: Nelson Textbook of Pediatrics, 21st Edition, Page 1598. https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3730472/",

      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: A) Pyrimethamine and sulfadiazine with folinic acid Explanation: This presentation with hydrocephalus, chorioretinitis, intracranial calcifications, and a positive Toxoplasma-specific IgM in the CSF is consistent with congenital toxoplasmosis. Pyrimethamine and Sulfadiazine with Folinic Acid (Option A) is the standard treatment for congenital toxoplasmosis. Pyrimethamine and sulfadiazine work synergistically to inhibit the growth of Toxoplasma gondii . Folinic acid is added to prevent bone marrow suppression, a common side effect of pyrimethamine, which inhibits dihydrofolate reductase, leading to reduced folic acid synthesis. Diagnosis Diagnosis Method Details Fetal Ultrasound Performed every 2 weeks during gestation after diagnosis of maternal infection. PCR Analysis of Amniotic Fluid Used for prenatal diagnosis of fetal infection. Serologic Tests Persistent or rising titers in dye/IFA tests, positive IgM-ELISA. Newborn Evaluation General, ophthalmologic, neurologic exams; head CT scan for intracranial calcifications. CSF Analysis Lumbar puncture with analysis for Toxoplasma-specific IgG and IgM, total IgG, cells, glucose, and protein. Toxoplasma Isolation Isolation from placenta, infant’s leukocytes, and CSF using PCR Management Treatment Details Pyrimethamine and Sulfadiazine, along with Folinic Acid (Calcium Leucovorin) Synergistic action against Toxoplasma gondii . Standard treatment for congenital toxoplasmosis. Folinic Acid is administered to prevent bone marrow suppression caused by pyrimethamine Spiramycin Used in pregnant women during the first trimester to prevent vertical transmission. Monitoring Regular leukocyte counts twice weekly to detect neutropenia and other hematologic effects. Acyclovir (Option B) is the treatment of choice for neonatal herpes simplex virus (HSV) infection. Ganciclovir and Valganciclovir (Option C) are antiviral agents used to treat congenital cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection. Although CMV can also present with intracranial calcifications, the presence of positive Toxoplasma-specific IgM in the CSF and the characteristic intracranial calcifications are more indicative of congenital toxoplasmosis. Spiramycin (1 g PO every 8 hr without food) is recommended for the prevention of fetal infection if the mother develops toxoplasmosis during pregnancy . It is used for infection acquired early in gestation when fetal infection is uncertain. (Option D) Reference: Nelson Textbook of Pediatrics, 21st Edition, Page 1666, 1874, 1875.",

      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: C) Administer a booster dose of diphtheria toxoid vaccine Explanation: The child is due for a booster (having not received one in the past 5 years), administering the diphtheria toxoid vaccine booster is the most appropriate action to ensure immunity. Diphtheria - Management of contacts Asymptomatic Case Contacts Includes household members and close contacts. Monitored for 7 days for symptoms. Prophylaxis: IM benzathine penicillin G (600,000 units for <6 years, 1,200,000 units for ≥ 6 years) or 10-day oral erythromycin (40-50 mg/kg/day, max 2 g/day). (Option B) Assess and update immunization status. Booster Dose : Administer the diphtheria toxoid vaccine to individuals who have not received a booster within the past 5 years. (Option C) Vaccinate children who have not yet received their 4th dose of diphtheria toxoid. Incomplete or Uncertain Immunization : For those who have received fewer than 3 doses of diphtheria toxoid or have an uncertain immunization status, provide the vaccine according to the primary immunization schedule with an age-appropriate preparation Asymptomatic Carriers Receive 10-14 days of antimicrobial prophylaxis. Administer diphtheria toxoid vaccine if no booster has been given in the past year. Droplet precautions for respiratory carriers; contact precautions for cutaneous carriers. Precautions continue until two negative cultures (24 hours apart) post-treatment. Antitoxin is not recommended for asymptomatic carriers. Follow-up & Repeat Cultures Repeat cultures for cases and carriers 2 weeks post-treatment. If positive, repeat a 10-day erythromycin course and further cultures. Complete eradication is not guaranteed after one course of antibiotics. Casual Contacts Routine investigation is not recommended due to low carriage rates. Hospital-Acquired Transmission Rare; only those with direct contact with respiratory/oral secretions need management as contacts. Administer a single dose of diphtheria antitoxin (Option A): Diphtheria antitoxin is used to treat individuals with symptomatic diphtheria, not for prophylaxis in asymptomatic contacts. The child does not need antitoxin because they are asymptomatic. Administer benzathine penicillin G (Option B): Benzathine penicillin G is used for prophylaxis in individuals who have not been fully vaccinated. No treatment or vaccination needed as the child is asymptomatic (Option D): Even asymptomatic contacts need to have their vaccination status reviewed and updated.

      },
      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: C) Administer diphtheria antitoxin immediately Explanation : Diphtheria antitoxin is crucial for treating diphtheria because it neutralizes the diphtheria toxin that is causing the disease's symptoms. The toxin can cause severe complications, including damage to the heart and nerves. Early administration of the antitoxin is essential to prevent further systemic effects and improve patient outcomes . Diphtheria - Diagnosis and management Clinical Suspicion High index of suspicion in exudative pharyngitis with greyish-white pseudomembrane (bleeds on removal). Symptoms: Fever, malaise, sore throat, dysphagia, muffled voice, \"bull neck\". Specimen Collection Collect from nose, throat, mucocutaneous lesions, and membrane exudate (if present). Laboratory Confirmation Albert Stain: Rapid visualization of Corynebacterium diphtheriae from oropharynx/larynx swabs. Culture: Definitive identification (8 hours) from affected area swabs nose, throat, lesions). Species-level identification, toxigenicity, antimicrobial susceptibility testing for Coryneform organisms. Send isolates to reference labs. MANAGEMENT Diphtheria Antitoxin Role: Cornerstone of treatment; administer immediately. Dosage: 20,000-100,000 units based on toxicity and illness duration. Sensitivity testing required; not effective for asymptomatic carriers. Antibiotic Therapy Aims: Stop toxin production, treat infection, prevent transmission. Regimens: Erythromycin (40-50 mg/kg/day) or Penicillin G (100,000-150,000 units/kg/day) for 14 days; shorter for cutaneous diphtheria. 2 negative cultures 24 hours apart confirm elimination of organisms. If C.Diphtheria is still present, erythromycin is repeated. Supportive Care Precautions: Droplet (pharyngeal), contact (cutaneous) until negative cultures. Wound Cleaning: Soap and water for cutaneous diphtheria. Rest: Bed rest during the acute phase; gradual recovery. Vaccination Administer diphtheria toxoid post-infection to complete the primary series or provide booster doses. Administer erythromycin (Option A): Erythromycin is part of the treatment but should not delay the administration of the antitoxin. Perform throat culture and wait for results (Option B): Waiting for culture results may delay the necessary treatment. Administer DPT vaccine (Option D): While vaccination is administered for treating the patient, it can only provide future protection, and does not help in neutralizing the toxins immediately .

      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: B) Isoniazid daily for 6 months. Explanation: Isoniazid (INH) daily for 6 months is the appropriate preventive therapy for children in contact with active TB, effectively managing latent TB infection and reducing the risk of progression to active disease. Isoniazid Prophylaxis: Indications: Asymptomatic contacts under 6 years old of a smear-positive TB case, irrespective of their BCG or nutritional status, after ruling out active disease. HIV-infected children who either had a known exposure to an infectious TB case or tuberculin skin test (TST) positive ( induration ≥ 5 mm), with no active TB disease. All TST-positive children receiving immunosuppressive therapy. Children born to mothers with TB during pregnancy, after ruling out congenital TB. Dosage and Duration: Isoniazid Dosage: 10 mg/kg per day, with a range of 7-15 mg/kg and a maximum dose of 300 mg/day. Treatment Duration: 6 months. Purpose: Prevents the development of TB disease in children who have latent TB infection. Reduces the likelihood of TB disease developing during childhood. Administration: Single isoniazid dispersible tablets of 100 mg are available from the Global Drug Facility (GDF). Follow-Up: Regular follow-up should be conducted at least every 2 months until treatment is complete. Resistance Risk: No risk of isoniazid resistance developing in children receiving IPT, even if active TB is missed. Pyrazinamide daily for 6 months (Option A): Pyrazinamide causes hepatitis more often in children than isoniazid. It is used to treat active TB, not for preventive therapy. BCG vaccine (Option B) is used for preventing severe forms of TB, in highly endemic settings. It is not recommended for use in this preventive therapy. BCG does not prevent latent TB progression, and revaccination offers no additional benefit. Ethambutol daily for 3 months (Option C): Ethambutol is used to treat active TB, not for preventive therapy. Using it alone for prevention can lead to drug resistance, so it is not recommended for latent TB infection management.
