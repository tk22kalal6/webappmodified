      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: C) Left ventricular hypertrophy Explanation: Left ventricular hypertrophy is not a feature of Tetralogy of Fallot. The condition is associated with right ventricular hypertrophy , and not left. Components of Tetralogy of Fallot: Pulmonary Stenosis : (Option A ruled out) Narrowing of the pathway from the right ventricle to the pulmonary artery, possibly affecting the infundibulum, valve, or main pulmonary artery. Ventricular Septal Defect (VSD) : (Option B ruled out) A large hole between the right and left ventricles, usually misaligned, allowing abnormal blood flow. Overriding Aorta : (Option D ruled out) The aorta is positioned over the septum, receiving blood from both ventricles. Right Ventricular Hypertrophy : (Option C) Thickening of the right ventricle wall due to the extra effort required to pump blood.

      "question": "A 2-month-old infant with Tetralogy of Fallot presents with severe cyanosis from birth and a loud systolic ejection murmur at the left sternal border. The cyanosis worsens with closure of the ductus arteriosus. What is the most likely severity of pulmonary stenosis in this infant?",

      },
      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: C) Severe. Explanation: Severe pulmonary stenosis results in severe cyanosis from birth and worsens with the closure of the ductus arteriosus. General Clinical Features of ToF: Cyanosis: Directly linked to the degree of pulmonary stenosis. Ranges from mild to severe based on the extent of RVOT (right ventricular outflow tract) obstruction. Older, untreated children may show dusky skin, gray sclerae, and clubbing. Hypercyanotic Spells (Tet Spells): Sudden increase in cyanosis, often triggered by crying or agitation. Symptoms include irritability, restlessness, rapid breathing, and severe cases like syncope or convulsions. Commonly occurs in the morning or after intense crying. Murmurs: Loud, harsh systolic ejection murmur at the left sternal border, radiating to the lungs. Murmur intensity may vary, louder with moderate stenosis, and diminishes during tet spells. A continuous murmur may indicate collateral vessels. Additional Findings: Palpable systolic thrill along the left sternal border. Single or soft S2 due to a stenotic pulmonary valve. Prominent right ventricular impulse. Bulging of the left anterior chest wall in older children due to RV hypertrophy. Impact of Pulmonary Stenosis Severity on Clinical Presentation: Pulmonary Stenosis Severity Clinical Presentation Mild (Option A ruled out) Initial heart failure symptoms due to left-to-right shunt. Cyanosis may appear later as RV hypertrophy worsens. Increased risk of hypercyanotic spells. Moderate (Option B ruled out) Inferred presentation: increased cyanosis as left-to-right shunt decreases. Systolic murmur becomes louder, longer, and harsher. Softer pulmonic component of the second heart sound (S2). Severe (Option C) Early neonatal cyanosis due to restricted pulmonary blood flow. Right-to-left shunt causing systemic deoxygenation. Potential reliance on ductus arteriosus; closure can lead to severe cyanosis and circulatory collapse. Pulmonary Atresia (Extreme) (Option D ruled out) Complete absence of pulmonary valve; entire RV output directed into the aorta. Pulmonary blood flow depends on collateral vessels (MAPCAs) or a persistent ductus arteriosus. Severity of cyanosis and prognosis depends on the development of pulmonary arteries. Key Points : Clinical presentation varies widely based on the combination and severity of the four defining defects of ToF. Pulmonary stenosis is the primary determinant of the clinical manifestations in ToF. Reference: Nelson textbook of pediatrics, 21st Edition, Page 2397.",

      "question": "A 10-year-old boy with an ideal weight for his age presents with a history of acute rheumatic fever (ARF) and is being considered for secondary prophylaxis to prevent recurrence. What is the recommended regimen of benzathine penicillin for this patient, assuming he has no carditis?",
      "options": {
        "A": "600,000 units every 4 weeks",
        "B": "1.2 million units every 3 weeks",
        "C": "1.2 million units every 2 weeks",
        "D": "600,000 units every 2 weeks"
      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: B) 1.2 million units every 3 weeks Explanation: To determine the recommended regimen of benzathine penicillin for a 10-year-old boy with a history of acute rheumatic fever (ARF) who has no carditis, we need to ist calculate the ideal weight for his age. According to the formula: For an age group of 7-12 years: We calculate weight by (7x − 5)/2, where x is the age in years For a 10-year-old boy: Ideal weight=(7×10 − 5)/2=(70 − 5)/2=65/2=32.5 kg. The standard regimen for patients over 30 kg with no carditis is 1.2 million units of benzathine penicillin every 3 weeks. Rheumatic Fever Prevention Strategies Primordial Prevention: Address social determinants to reduce Group A Streptococcus (GAS) transmission. Primary Prevention: Diagnosis & Treatment : Use penicillin antibiotics for GAS infections to prevent acute rheumatic fever (ARF). School Programs : Implement early detection and treatment of GAS pharyngitis in schools. Secondary Prevention: Prophylaxis : Administer continuous benzathine penicillin to prevent ARF recurrence. Management : Detect and manage rheumatic heart disease (RHD) early to avoid complications. Role of Benzathine Penicillin: Effectiveness: Prevents recurrence of rheumatic fever by eliminating Group A streptococci, reducing the risk of heart damage. Administration: Dosage: >30 kg: 1.2 million units every 3 weeks. (Option B) <30 kg (high prevalence areas): 6 lakh units every 2 weeks. Duration: Without Carditis: 5 years after the last episode or until 18 years of age, whichever is longer. With Carditis: 10 years after the last episode or until 25 years of age, whichever is longer. With Established RHD/Valve Surgery: Lifelong or until 40 years of age. Tertiary Prevention: Medical Treatment : Provide heart surgery and chronic treatment for managing chronic RHD. Community-Based Programs: Combine prevention strategies to reduce the RHD burden. More evaluations are needed, especially in low- and middle-income countries, to improve public health strategies and policies.

      "explanation": "Correct Answer: C) Transposition of the Great Arteries Explanation: Rapid onset of symptoms immediately after birth and egg-on-string appearance on the chest X-ray suggest transposition of the great arteries. Transposition of the Great Arteries: The main pulmonary artery arises from the left ventricle and the aorta arises from the right ventricle . Pathophysiology: Oxygenated pulmonary venous blood recirculates in the lungs and systemic venous blood recirculates in the systemic circulation. Clinical presentation: Classified as: With intact ventricular septum: Cyanotic at birth Rapid breathing Congestive heart failure secondary to hypoxemia within few days of life Normal S2, single S2.

      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: B) Truncus Arteriosus Explanation: Truncus arteriosus is a conotruncal heart defect that may be associated with DiGeorge syndrome , which is related to a deletion of a significant portion of chromosome 22q11. Truncus Arteriosus: Pathophysiology: A single arterial trunk (truncus arteriosus) originates from the heart and supplies the systemic, pulmonary, and coronary circulations. VSD is always present. Truncus receives blood from both the right and left ventricles Associated with DiGeorge syndrome (deletion of a large region of chromosome 22q11 or CATCH 22).

      },
      "correct_answer": "D",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: D) Coarctation of the Aorta Explanation: Coarctation of the aorta involves narrowing of the aorta leading to decreased blood flow (leg pain during exertion), radio-femoral delay, and murmur in the shoulder region due to collateral formation. Chest X-ray shows notching of the inferior border of the ribs due to pressure erosion by enlarged collateral vessels. Coarctation of the Aorta: Constrictions of the aorta of varying degrees at any point from the transverse arch to the iliac bifurcation. Juxtaductal coarctation- 98% occurrence Clinical presentation: Differential cyanosis Heart failure in severe cases Weakness or pain/claudication (or both) in the legs after exercise Radio-femoral delay: Disparity in pulsation and BP in the arms and legs Systolic or continuous murmurs are heard over the left and right sides of the chest laterally and posteriorly due to collateral blood flow.

        "D": "Underdeveloped left heart."
      },
      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: A) No RA-RV communication Explanation: This describes tricuspid valve atresia. In this condition, the tricuspid valve is absent or malformed, preventing blood flow from the right atrium (RA) to the right ventricle (RV). Blood instead flows through an atrial septal defect (ASD) into the left atrium (LA) and then to the left ventricle (LV). The LV becomes hypertrophied due to handling increased blood volume and pressure Tricuspid Atresia Definition: A congenital condition characterized by the absence of the tricuspid valve, leading to a hypoplastic (underdeveloped) right ventricle. (Option D ruled out). Clinical Presentation: Depends on pulmonary blood flow, which may be diminished or increased. Diminished pulmonary blood flow: Constitutes 90% of cases. Symptoms and physical signs are similar to Tetralogy of Fallot (TOF). Features Suggesting Tricuspid Atresia: Apical Impulse: Left ventricular type of apical impulse. Jugular Venous Pulse: Prominent large 'a' waves. Liver: Enlarged with presystolic pulsations (a waves). Electrocardiogram (ECG): Characterized by left axis deviation. Left ventricular hypertrophy. Mean QRS axis around —45°. Immediate Treatment: PGE (Prostaglandin E1) Infusion: Medication: Alprostadil infusion. Purpose: Keeps the ductus arteriosus patent to allow blood flow from the aorta into the pulmonary artery. Definitive Treatment: Series of Surgical Procedures: Modified Blalock-Taussig Shunt: Purpose: Improve pulmonary blood flow. Glenn Shunt: Procedure: Connects the superior vena cava (SVC) directly to the pulmonary artery. Purpose: Prevents overloading of the left heart chambers and increases pulmonary blood flow. Fontan Shunt: Procedure: Connects the inferior vena cava (IVC) directly to the pulmonary artery. Purpose: Diverts blood flow directly to the pulmonary artery, bypassing the right heart. Obstructed pulmonary outflow with intact septum (Option B): This describes pulmonary atresia with an intact ventricular septum. The left side of the heart does not typically show left ventricular hypertrophy Ventricular septal defect and pulmonary stenosis (Option C): This describes tetralogy of Fallot. The ECG typically shows right axis deviation and right ventricular hypertrophy.

      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: B) Atrialization of the Right ventricle Explanation: The clinical presentation of cyanosis at birth, pansystolic murmur due to tricuspid regurgitation, mother’s history of Bipolar (Lithium exposed pregnancy), and the characteristic Himalayan P wave on ECG is most consistent with Atrialization of the right ventricle. This condition is also known as Ebstein's Anomaly. Ebstein's Anomaly: Associated with Lithium exposure during pregnancy. Pathophysiology: Downward displacement/prolapse of the tricuspid valve. Part of the right ventricular volume becomes part of the right atrium (atrialization of the right ventricle). Consequences: Tricuspid Regurgitation: Prolapsed valve → Blood from the right ventricle regurgitates into the right atrium. RVOT (Right Ventricular Outflow Tract) Obstruction: Prolapsed valve partly occludes blood flow towards the pulmonary artery → Cyanosis. Features: Cyanosis at birth or during the neonatal period. Pansystolic murmur: Due to tricuspid regurgitation. Quadruple Rhythm: Irregular blood flow in the right heart, RVOT obstruction, and tricuspid regurgitation → Multiple added sounds and ejection clicks. X-Ray Findings: Right atrial enlargement due to regurgitation from the right ventricle and atrialization of the right ventricle. RA forms the right heart border, which displaces laterally and appears on X-ray as a box-shaped heart. ECG: Himalayan P Waves Tetralogy of",
