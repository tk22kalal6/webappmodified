      },
      "correct_answer": "D",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: D) Spondyloepiphyseal dysplasia Explanation: In the given scenario, the upper segment: lower segment ratio of the child is 1:1 signifying upper segment short stature which is seen in spondyloepiphyseal dysplasia. The normal US: LS ratio for a 3-year-old child is 1.3: 1. Here the height of the child is 90cm with LS = 45cm. Hence the US = 45cm. US: LS = 1:1. This means that the upper segment is shorter than normal. Spondyloepiphyseal dysplasia causes short-trunk dwarfism involving the vertebrae and proximal epiphyseal centres. The distal epiphyses are spared in this condition. Proportionate Short Stature Conditions Causing Short Stature with US > LS Conditions Causing Short Stature with US < LS Growth hormone deficiency Genetic syndromes: Noonan syndrome, Prader-Willi syndrome, 3M syndrome Environmental pollutants: Lead, calcium, hexachlorobenzene, polychlorinated biphenyl Family history Achondroplasia (Option A) Congenital hypothyroidism (Option B) Turner syndrome Diastrophic dysplasia Rickets (Option C) Spondyliepiphyseal dysplasia (Option D) Morquio syndrome Reference: O.P.

      "explanation": "of the first year, the brain reaches about 60% of its adult size. This period is critical for neurodevelopment, with significant increases in brain volume and neural connections. Incorrect options: Option B - 2 years : Brain growth continues, but the rate slows down after the first year. By 2 years of age, the brain is approximately 75% of its adult size, but the most intense phase of growth has already occurred. Option C - 3 years : By 3 years, the brain is about 80-85% of its adult size. Growth is still significant, but it is not as rapid as during the first year. Option D - 4 years : The brain's growth rate further decreases, reaching around 90% of its adult size by this age.

      "question": "A 10 year old child presented to the clinic with complaints of recurrent infection. Physical examination shows low height for age and Z line score is <-2SD. The parents also have a history of incorrect feeding method. What is the appropriate term for the above mentioned condition?",
      "options": {
        "A": "Stunting",

        "C": "Malnutrition",
        "D": "Kwashiorkor"
      },
      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "as low height-for-age. This condition is a result of long-term nutritional deprivation, often exacerbated by recurrent infections. A Z-score of less than -2 standard deviations (SD) below the median of the World Health Organization's child growth standards is indicative of stunting. The history of incorrect feeding method provided by the parents further supports this diagnosis. Incorrect Options: Option B - Wasting: Wasting, or acute malnutrition, is defined as low weight-for-height. It's a sign of recent and severe weight loss, which does not seem to be the case with the child described in the question. Option C - Malnutrition: While the child is indeed malnourished, this term is broad and doesn't specify the type of malnutrition. In this case, the child's low height-for-age and Z-score of <-2SD indicate stunting, a specific form of malnutrition. Option D - Kwashiorkor: Kwashiorkor is a form of severe malnutrition characterized by edema (swelling), discolored hair, and dermatosis. It's typically caused by a diet high in carbohydrates but deficient in protein. The question does not provide any information suggesting the child has these symptoms.",

      "question": "Which of the following is the best sign to indicate adequate growth in an infant with a birth weight of 2.8 kg?",
      "options": {
        "A": "Increase in length of 25 cm in the first year",
        "B": "Weight gain of 300 grams per month till 1 year",
        "C": "Anterior fontanelle closure by 6 months of age",
        "D": "Weight under the 75th percentile and height under the 25th percentile"
      },
      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: A) Increase in length of 25 cm in the first year Explanation: The best indicator of adequate growth in an infant is an increase in length of 25 cm in the first year. Normal length at birth: 50cm. In the first year, there is an increase of 25cm , so at 1 year the height is 75cm. In the second year there is an increase of 10-15cm, so at 2 years the height is 85-90cm. There is a steady increase of 6cm/year till 12 years. Height doubles by 4 years Height triples by 12 years Half of adult height in a normal child (80-85cm) is achieved by 2 years (18-24 months). Age Length At birth 50cm By 3 months 60cm By 9 months 70cm By 1 year 75cm At 2 years 90cm At 4-4.5 years 100cm Weech's formula to estimate the expected weight and height of children using age as a variable. For <1 year : x + 9 ÷ 2 ( Where x is age in months ) For 1-6 years : 2x + 8 ( Where x is age in years ) For 7-12 years : 7x - 5 ÷ 2 ( Where x is age in years ) Weight gain of 300 grams per month till 1 year (Option B): In the first few months, weight gain typically varies from 20-40 grams per day, and after 4 months, it increases to approximately 400 grams per month, with doubling at 5 months and tripling by 1 year. Anterior fontanelle closure by 6 months of age (Option C): The anterior fontanelle typically closes between 9 and 18 months, not by 6 months, making it an unreliable indicator for growth. Weight under the 75th percentile and height under the 25th percentile (Option D): Percentiles are used to compare an infant’s growth measurements with a reference population. However, being under the 75th percentile for weight and under the 25th percentile for height does not guarantee adequate growth. Reference: O.P.

      "question": "A 6-year-old child is brought for evaluation of short stature. His height is comparable with his parent’s height and his bone age corresponds to his chronological age. What is the diagnosis?",
      "options": {
        "A": "Familial short stature",
        "B": "Constitutional delay",
        "C": "Undernutrition",
        "D": "Growth hormone deficiency"
      },
      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer A - Familial short stature The clinical presentation indicates familial short stature, which is characterized by height below the 3rd percentile for age and sex but is normal according to the child's genetic potential , as determined by parental heights. Key features supporting this diagnosis include bone age matching chronological age and height being consistent with parental heights, suggesting genetic rather than pathological short stature . Characteristics of Familial Short Stature: Child's height is <3rd percentile of expected according to age & sex, but is normal as per his target height Child has normal puberty Family history of short stature Bone age = chronological age Constitutional delay (Option B): In constitutional growth delay, the child presents with delayed bone age and delayed puberty, unlike this case where bone age matches chronological age. Most of these children tend to eventually grow to approximately the same height as their parents. Undernutrition (Option C): Undernutrition shows evidence of poor weight gain and delayed bone age, which are absent in this case. Nutritional deficiency would affect both growth and skeletal maturation, leading to discrepancy between bone age and chronological age. Growth hormone deficiency (Option D): Growth hormone deficiency, also known as dwarfism or pituitary dwarfism, typically presents with severe growth failure, delayed bone age, and height that is significantly below parental heights.

      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer B - Skeletal system Gonadal growth corresponds with skeletal growth , particularly during puberty Estrogen in females and testosterone in males play a significant role in developing secondary sexual characteristics and contribute to the growth and maturation of the skeleton This hormonal influence leads to changes in bone structure and overall height Brain (Option A) growth follows a different pattern, with rapid growth occurring primarily in early childhood and reaching almost adult size by age 6 years. This pattern differs significantly from gonadal development. Lymphoid growth (Option C) follows a unique pattern with peak development occurring before puberty and then involuting, unlike gonadal growth which accelerates during puberty. Lymphoid tissue reaches 200% of adult size during childhood. Dental growth (Option D) follows its own distinct timeline with two separate periods of development - primary and permanent dentition. This pattern does not correspond with gonadal development patterns. Reference: Ghai Essential Pediatrics 10th Edition, Page 6-7",

        "A": "Head circumference",
        "B": "Arm span",
        "C": "Crown-rump length",
        "D": "Knee height"
      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "alternative method for the procedure shown is arm span . Ideally, height is measured using an infantometer in children <2 years of age, and a stadiometer is used in children >2 years of age. In conditions such as scoliosis where a stadiometer cannot be used, alternatives such as arm span and upper segment to lower segment (US:LS) ratio are some of the reliable alternatives. Arm span: Measured on arms outstretched at 90 degrees to the body from the tip of the middle finger of one hand to the tip of the middle finger of the other hand. Arm span is shorter than the length by 2.5 cm at birth, equals height at 11 years, and after that is slightly (usually, <1 cm) greater than height. Head circumference (Option A) used to monitor the growth of the brain and skull in children up to 2 years of age. It is measured along the supraorbital ridge in the front and the occipital prominence at the back using a flexible tape. While it reflects brain growth, it does not provide an accurate estimation of height, making it unsuitable for this purpose. Crown-rump length (Option C) is a prenatal measurement used during early pregnancy to assess fetal growth and estimate gestational age, typically from 6-8 weeks of gestation . This measurement is specific to fetuses and cannot be applied to children for height estimation. Knee height (Option D) is used to",

      "question": "A child is brought to the paediatrician with short stature. On evaluation, growth hormone levels are found to be high and insulin-like growth factor (IGF-1) levels are low. Which among the following could be the abnormality here?",
      "options": {
        "A": "GH deficiency",
        "B": "GHRH deficiency",
        "C": "GH receptor anomaly",
        "D": "IGF-1 deficiency"
      },
      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer C - GH receptor anomaly The raised levels of growth hormone and low levels of IGF-1 suggest growth hormone insensitivity which is due to GH receptor anomaly. GH stimulates the liver to produce insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1), which in turn promotes the growth of bones and tissues. If there is a GH-receptor anomaly in the liver, leads to GH insensitivity. Hene, IGF-1 is not sufficiently produced lowering its concentration in the body. Growth Hormone Receptor anomalies: Laron syndrome: Mutation of the GH receptor leading to growth hormone insensitivity. The GH receptor has an extracellular, transmembrane, and intracellular domain. Mutation of the extracellular domain Affects the binding of the hormone GH-binding protein activity is low Mutation of the transmembrane domain: Affects the anchoring of the receptor to the plasma membrane Normal or high GH-binding protein Mutation of the intracellular domain: Interferes with JAK/STAT signalling GH deficiency (Option A) : If the child had GH deficiency, both GH and IGF-1 levels would typically be low. GHRH deficiency (Option B) : Growth hormone-releasing hormone (GHRH) deficiency would typically lead to low GH secretion because GHRH stimulates the release of GH. IGF-1 deficiency (Option D) : Low IGF-1 levels can cause short stature, but the presence of high GH levels suggests that the issue lies not in the production of IGF-1 but in the action of GH itself.

      "explanation": "Correct Answer D - Moderate malnutrition - teach the mother how to feed The child's weight for age falls between -2 SD and -3 SD on the growth chart (Moderately underweight). This child's weight is below the average range for his age, indicating some degree of malnutrition. However, it is not severe enough to warrant immediate referral to a nutrition rehabilitation center. Instead, the focus should be on educating the mother or caregiver on proper feeding practices and providing guidance on improving the child's nutritional intake. This may involve promoting a balanced diet, ensuring adequate calorie and nutrient intake, and addressing any feeding difficulties or challenges.

      "explanation": "Correct Answer: C) Right upper limb Explanation: Preductal Saturation: Refers to the oxygen saturation before blood passes through the ductus arteriosus . The right upper limb (right hand) receives blood directly from the aorta before the ductus arteriosus , hence it reflects preductal oxygenation . In contrast, the lower limbs and left upper limb may receive blood that is postductal , especially if the ductus is still patent. Clinical Relevance: Preductal SpO I is important during the first minutes after birth to assess the baby's transition from fetal to neonatal circulation. Target preductal SpO I increases gradually over the first 10 minutes of life: ~60–65% at 1 min ~85–95% by 10 min Left upper limb (Option A): This limb may receive postductal blood due to the anatomical position of the ductus arteriosus and is unreliable for preductal measurement. Left lower limb (Option B): Postductal, as it receives blood distal to the ductus arteriosus. Right lower limb (Option D): Also postductal; not appropriate for assessing preductal oxygenation.
