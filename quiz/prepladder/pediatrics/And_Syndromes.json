Common features include upslanting palpebral fissures, flat facial profile, and hypotonia. Trisomy 18 (Edwards syndrome) (Option B) : Trisomy 18 can present with similar cardiac defects and occasionally cleft lip/palate, but microcephaly and polydactyly are more characteristic of Trisomy 13.

(Option B) Homoplasmy implies all mtDNA are identical which could be all wild type or all mutated . Heteroplasmy is a mixture of mutated and wild-type mtDNA. In the presence of heteroplasmy there is a threshold effect and clinical expression can vary between different tissues due to variation in mtDNA mutations. (Option C) Mitochondrial Inheritance Disorders: Inheritance Pattern Maternal inheritance: All children of an affected female inherit the disease. Homoplasmy: Presence of mtDNA which is either all wild type or all mutated . Heteroplasmy: Presence of both wild type (normal) and mutated mtDNA in the same individual. Threshold effect: Minimum percentage of mutated mtDNA required for disease manifestation. In the presence of heteroplasmy, the threshold effect leads to variability in clinical expression across different tissues and mtDNA mutations.

Clinical Features of Turner Syndrome: Short Stature : A prominent feature, often becoming noticeable early in childhood. Skeletal Abnormalities : Short Fourth Metacarpal : A shortened bone in the hand. Cubitus Valgus : Increased carrying angle of the arms. Auditory Issues : Sensorineural Hearing Loss. Gonadal Dysgenesis : Primary Amenorrhea : Due to underdeveloped (streak) ovaries and a rudimentary uterus, leading to infertility. (Option B) Absent Barr Body : Seen in cytogenetic analysis, indicative of Turner syndrome. Cardiovascular Abnormalities : Coarctation of the Aorta (Option A), bicuspid aortic valve, hypertension - May develop over time due to cardiovascular abnormalities.

Postnatal diagnosis: Physical examination showing characteristic features Confirmed by karyotype analysis Antenatal Screening and Diagnosis: 1. Confirmatory Test: Fetal Karyotype Analysis is the gold standard for the prenatal diagnosis of Down syndrome, confirming the presence of an extra copy of chromosome 21. Chorionic Villous Sampling (CVS), Amniocentesis, Cordocentesis (Percutaneous Umbilical Blood Sampling). 2. Radiological Markers: First Trimester: Increased Nuchal Translucency (NT): An NT thickness greater than 3 mm, measured between 11-14 weeks, is a significant marker for Down syndrome. (Option B) Second Trimester: Soft Markers: Include shortened femur length, hypoplastic nasal bones, cardiac anomalies, and duodenal atresia. 3. Biochemical Markers: First Trimester (T1): β -HCG & PAPP-A: Elevated β -HCG and low PAPP-A levels are suggestive of Down syndrome. (Option A and C) Second Trimester (T2): Triple Test: Measures β -HCG, unconjugated estriol, and α -fetoprotein. Quadruple Test: Adds Inhibin-A to the triple test markers. Elevated Markers in Down Syndrome: Increased β -HCG and Inhibin-A levels are characteristic. 4. Integrated Test: Combines maternal age, T1 (NT thickness, PAPP-A), and T2 (quadruple test) to calculate a composite risk for Down syndrome. 5. Non-Invasive Prenatal Screening/Test (NIPS/NIPT): Cell-Free Fetal DNA Testing: Analyzes fetal DNA circulating in maternal blood to detect chromosomal abnormalities like Down syndrome.

Small nose with flat nasal bridge Narrow palate, small teeth, and furrowed, protruding tongue Significant hypotonia Small, brachycephalic skull with flat occiput, and small, dysplastic ears Short, broad hands with clinodactyly (hypoplasia of the middle phalanx of the fifth finger) Simian crease on the palm A wide gap between the first and second toes (sandal gap) Comorbidities Congenital Heart Disease (Option D) : 40% of children have congenital heart defects, primarily endocardial cushion defects (40-60% of cases) - AVSD, VSD, ASD, PDA, TOF. Early cardiac evaluation is crucial. Gastrointestinal Malformations : 12% have atresias, especially duodenal atresia. There is an increased risk of annular pancreas and Hirschsprung disease. Ophthalmic Problems : Increased risk of cataracts, nystagmus, strabismus, and visual acuity issues. Regular eye evaluations are advised from infancy onward. Hearing Defects : 40-60% experience conductive hearing loss, often due to serous otitis media in the first year. Routine hearing assessments are recommended before 6 months of age and annually. Thyroid Dysfunction : Hypothyroidism occurs in 13-54% of patients. Atlanto-occipital Subluxation : Incidence ranges from 10-30%. A lateral neck radiograph is recommended. Physical Growth : Linear growth is typically slower, and children may become obese with age. Muscle tone often improves, but regular monitoring of height and weight is necessary. Malignancies : Increased risk of lymphoproliferative disorders, such as acute lymphoblastic leukemia (Option B), acute myeloid leukemia, myelodysplasia, and transient lymphoproliferative syndrome. Early-Onset Alzheimer's Disease (Option A): The APP gene, located on chromosome 21, plays a significant role in amyloid plaque formation, a hallmark of Alzheimer's disease.

Dynamic mutations: Unlike traditional mutations, the number of repeats can change (usually increase) from one generation to the next or even within an individual's lifetime. This instability is a hallmark of these disorders. Examples of Trinucleotide repeat disorders include: Disease Trinucleotide Repeat Huntington's disease CAG Fragile X syndrome CGG Friedreich's ataxia GAA Myotonic dystrophy type 1 CTG Reference: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK559254/",

Affected Females: Transmit the condition to 50% of their sons and 50% of their daughters. Severe Cases: In some instances, the mutant gene causes severe developmental effects, resulting in affected males rarely being born alive.

      "explanation": "of the two X chromosomes in a heterozygous female. However, it is possible for skewed X-inactivation to occur where the X chromosome with the mutant allele is predominantly active in most cells. This can result in the expression of the disorder if the majority of cells have the X chromosome carrying the mutant allele. Other scenarios where females manifest X-linked recessive disorders: The female has only one X chromosome: In Turner syndrome (45,X), females only have one X chromosome. Therefore, if they inherit a mutated X chromosome, they will manifest the X-linked recessive disorder.

X-linked Recessive Disorders in Females: Typically do not manifest clinically because the normal allele on the other X chromosome compensates for the mutant allele. Females with one mutant allele are carriers of the disorder. Inheritance Pattern: Carrier females pass the mutant allele to half of their male children, who will then be affected by the disorder.
