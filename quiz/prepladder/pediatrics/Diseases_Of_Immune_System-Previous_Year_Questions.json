      },
      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: C) Bruton syndrome Explanation The decreased serum IgA, IgG, IgM, IgE, plasma B cells and the recurrent infections suggest the diagnosis of Bruton syndrome which is an X-linked agammaglobulinemia. Brutons’s Disease: Also Known as X-linked agammaglobulinemia (XLA) caused by mutations in the BTK (Bruton’s tyrosine kinase) gene present on the q22 long arm of the X chromosome. Defective B-cell maturation leads to an absence of mature B cells and very low levels of all immunoglobulins (IgG, IgA, IgM). Clinical features : Presents after 6-9 months of age. Recurrent bacterial infections (eg- encapsulated bacteria like Streptococcus pneumonia, Haemophilus influenzae) starting around 6 months of age including otitis media, pneumonia, and sinusitis, Neutropenia and enterovirus infections. Diagnosis : Absence of B cells (CD19+ cells) in peripheral blood and Markedly low immunoglobulin levels No germinal centres in lymph nodes Ataxia-Telangiectasia (Option A) is characterized by cerebellar ataxia, telangiectasias, and immunodeficiency. The immunodeficiency is variable with low immunoglobulins and T cells. There is common IgA deficiency (selective absence of IgA in 50-80 %); impaired T- and B-cell responses; and small, disorganized thymus. Chronic granulomatous disease (Option B) is due to the reduced activity of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) oxidase, leading to impaired generation of superoxide radicals. It presents with persistent smouldering pneumonia, prominent lymphadenitis, multiple liver abscesses, osteomyelitis of small bones of hands and feet, recurrent, life-threatening infections usually by catalase-positive bacteria (e.g., Staphylococcus aureus, Serratia) and fungi (e.g., Aspergillus) DiGeorge syndrome (Option D) is caused by microdeletion on chromosome 22q11.2 and presents with cardiac anomalies, abnormal facies, thymic hypoplasia/ aplasia, cleft palate, and hypocalcemic tetany.

      "question": "A 7-year-old boy has non-blanching rashes on the legs and buttocks. He also complains of joint pains, abdominal pain, vomiting, and blood in the stool.

      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: B) Henoch Schonlein purpura (HSP) The clinical scenario of purpura in legs and buttocks, arthritic pain, abdominal pain and normal platelet level are characteristic of Henoch-Schönlein Purpura (HSP). Henoch-Schönlein Purpura (HSP) Aetiology The exact cause is unknown. Immune-mediated vasculitis, often following an upper respiratory infection. Genetic predisposition, with HLA-B34 and DRB1, was observed in some cases. Most common in Males . Pathology and Pathophysiology Inflammation of small blood vessels affecting skin, joints, intestines, and kidneys. Triggered by immune system response to infections. Leakage of fluid and blood cells into tissues. Immune complex deposition, particularly IgA , in affected vessels. Clinical Features Palpable Purpura: Raised, purplish-red rash, mainly on lower limbs and buttocks. Joint Involvement: Joint swelling, commonly in knees and ankles. Abdominal Pain: Often severe, may include vomiting, diarrhoea, gastrointestinal bleeding, or intussusception Renal Involvement: Less common, presents as Chronic renal failure. Diagnosis Clinical Criteria: Palpable purpura plus at least one of: Diffuse abdominal pain Arthritis or arthralgia Biopsy-proven IgA deposition Renal involvement (hematuria &/ proteinuria) Laboratory involvement: Elevated ESR or CRP indicates inflammation. Platelet Counts are normal. Complications Intussusception. Chronic Renal Failure due to Long-term kidney damage, in severe cases. Neurological Complications: Rare; may include seizures, headaches, or peripheral neuropathy. Treatment Mild Cases: Rest, hydration, and pain relievers. Moderate to Severe Cases: Corticosteroids (e.g., prednisone) to reduce inflammation. Severe or Resistant Cases: Additional immunosuppressive medications may be required. Prognosis Full recovery in most cases. Variable based on renal involvement. Malar rash is virtually pathognomonic in systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) (Option A) . It involves the cheek, bridge of the nose, and lower eyelids but characteristically spares the nasolabial folds. In Immune thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP) (Option C) , children present with a sudden appearance of bruises and mucosal bleeding like epistaxis, oral oozing and prolonged bleeds with superficial trauma. The platelet levels are low in this condition unlike the given scenario. Polyarteritis arteritis nodosa (Option D) rare in childhood, is characterised by the presence of either a biopsy showing small and mid-size artery necrotising vasculitis or angiographic abnormalities.

      "explanation": "Correct Answer D - Henoch-Schonlein purpura The clinical scenario of palpable blanching purpura, arthritic pain, abdominal pain with normal platelet count is characteristic of Henoch-Schönlein Purpura (HSP) . Henoch-Schönlein Purpura (HSP) Henoch-Schonlein purpura (HSP) is a systemic vasculitis that primarily affects small blood vessels, commonly seen in children. The characteristic clinical features include palpable purpura, abdominal pain, joint pain, and renal involvement. Hematuria and proteinuria are common findings in urine examination due to kidney involvement. The symptoms may be preceded by an upper respiratory tract infection Etiology Most common in males. Exact cause unknown. Immune-mediated vasculitis, often following an upper respiratory infection. Genetic predisposition, with HLA-B34 and DRB1 observed in some cases. Pathology and Pathophysiology Inflammation of small vessels affecting skin, joints, intestines, and kidneys. Triggered by immune system response to infections.

Moderate to Severe Cases: Corticosteroids (e.g., prednisone) to reduce inflammation. Severe or Resistant Cases: Additional immunosuppressive medications may be required. While Immune thrombocytopenic purpura (Option A) can present with purpura and thrombocytopenia, it does not typically involve joint pain, abdominal pain or renal manifestations such as hematuria and proteinuria. Dengue (Option B) is a viral infection that can cause fever, rash, joint pain and thrombocytopenia . Churg Strauss syndrome (Option C) also known as eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis, is a rare systemic vasculitis that primarily affects medium and small blood vessels. It is characterized by asthma, eosinophilia, and systemic vasculitis.

      "explanation": "inflammation of blood vessels. The causes of HSP are unknown. HSP affects the small blood vessels of the body leading to rash, which is also known as purpura. Following are the symptoms of HSP a skin rash, which appears like small bruises or small reddish-purple spots – it is usually seen on the legs and around the elbows and buttocks. Swelling of the feet and hands, and sometimes swelling of the scrotum in males. Pain in the joints, mostly of knees and ankles, stomachache, blood in the faeces or urine. Incorrect options: Option A: IgA nephropathy is present with hematuria 1 to 3 days after the onset of upper respiratory tract infection. IgA nephropathy is also known as Berger disease. Option C: RPGN is a Rapid loss of Renal function following GN presents with Oliguria/Anuria, Raised renal function test, and Bleeding manifestations. Option D : PSGN, i.e., post-streptococcal glomerulonephritis, occurs 1 to 2 weeks after the onset of upper respiratory tract infection, and it is also associated with haematuria.

      "explanation": "small blood vessels. It is most commonly seen in children. HSP is characterized by inflammation and damage to blood vessels, which can lead to a variety of symptoms. The key features in this case that point towards HSP are: Swelling of knee joints: Non-blanching rashes (purpura) Haematuria +++ and proteinuria Normal platelet levels Incorrect Option Options A . Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE): SLE is an autoimmune disease that can also affect multiple organs, including joints, skin, and kidneys. However, in this case, the presence of non-blanching rashes (purpura) and normal platelet levels is more suggestive of HSP rather than SLE. Options C . Immune thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP): ITP is a condition characterized by low platelet levels and abnormal bleeding. The presence of normal platelet levels in this case makes ITP an unlikely diagnosis. Options D . Polyarteritis Nodosa (PAN): PAN is a systemic vasculitis that affects medium and small arteries. It typically presents with symptoms such as fever, weight loss, abdominal pain, and muscle/joint pain. The combination of non-blanching rashes (purpura) and kidney involvement is not typical of PAN.",
