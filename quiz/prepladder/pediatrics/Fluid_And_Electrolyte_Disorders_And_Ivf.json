      "question": "A 5-year-old boy is brought to the emergency department with a history of profuse watery diarrhea and multiple episodes of vomiting for the past 3 days. On examination, he appears lethargic, has poor oral acceptance, and has dry mucous membranes. Laboratory tests reveal serum potassium of 2.8 mEq/L. Which of the following is the most appropriate initial treatment for this patient?",
      "options": {
        "A": "Oral potassium chloride solution",
        "B": "Intravenous potassium chloride at 0.5 mEq/kg/hour",
        "C": "Intravenous potassium chloride at 1.5 mEq/kg/hour",
        "D": "Potassium-sparing diuretic"
      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: B) Intravenous potassium chloride at 0.5 mEq/kg/hour Explanation: Normal serum potassium level: 3.5-5.5 meq/L. Hypokalemia is defined as a serum potassium level below 3.5 mEq/L. Mild hypokalemia: 3 - 3.5 mEq/L Moderate hypokalemia: 2.5 - 3.0 mEq/L Severe hypokalemia: <2.5 mEq/L In this case, the patient has moderate hypokalemia with symptoms of lethargy and dehydration. Etiology: Common causes of hypokalemia in children include: Gastrointestinal losses (diarrhea, vomiting) Renal losses (diuretics, renal tubular disorders) Inadequate intake Transcellular shifts (e.g., insulin administration, beta-agonists) Clinical features: Muscle weakness Fatigue Constipation Cardiac arrhythmias (in severe cases) Polyuria and polydipsia Treatment: The treatment of hypokalemia depends on its severity and the presence of symptoms. In this case, with moderate hypokalemia and symptoms, intravenous replacement is appropriate. Potassium Supplementation: Indications for IV Potassium Supplementation: Symptomatic patients Severe hypokalemia (<2.5 mEq/L) Presence of ECG abnormalities Unable to tolerate oral feeds. IV Potassium Chloride Supplementation: Dosage: 0.5-1 mEq/kg per dose Administration: IV infusion over 1-2 hours Infusion Rate: Do not exceed 1 mEq/kg per hour Potassium Concentration: Maximum of 60 mEq/L for peripheral lines Maximum of 80 mEq/L for central lines Avoid using glucose-containing fluids to prevent insulin-mediated intracellular potassium shift. Oral Potassium Supplementation: Dosage: 2-4 mEq/kg per day, divided into 3-4 doses Common Preparations: Potassium chloride (10%; 20 mEq/15 mL) Potassium citrate (especially for renal tubular acidosis) Administration Tip: Liquid preparations can be bitter; dilute with juice or water to improve taste.

      "question": "A 10-kg child with severe dehydration requires rapid fluid resuscitation. Which of the following IV fluids is most appropriate for initial management?",
      "options": {
        "A": "5% Dextrose in 0.45% Normal Saline",
        "B": "Normal Saline (0.9% NaCl)",
        "C": "10% Dextrose",
        "D": "Isolyte P Solution"
      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: B) Normal Saline (0.9% NaCl) Explanation: Normal Saline (0.9% NaCl) is the fluid of choice for initial rapid fluid resuscitation in children with severe dehydration or shock. It has the following characteristics: Isotonic solution with osmolality of 308 mOsm/L Contains 154 mEq/L of both sodium and chloride Does not contain glucose, potassium, or other electrolytes For a 10-kg child, the initial bolus would typically be 20 mL/kg (200 mL) given rapidly over 15-20 minutes. Infusion of large volumes of normal saline may be associated with hyperchloremic metabolic acidosis and associated adverse effects. Balanced salt solutions(RL) are physiologically similar to human plasma and contain less chloride. Ringer's Lactate is also an acceptable alternative, especially in cases of prolonged shock or diarrhoea, as it is a more balanced solution. IV fluids used in pediatrics include: 1. Normal Saline (0.9% NaCl): Used for initial fluid resuscitation in shock or severe dehydration Also used for the correction of hypernatremia 2. Lactated Ringer's Solution: An alternative to Normal Saline for fluid resuscitation Contains electrolytes closer to plasma composition 3. 5% Dextrose in Water (D5W): Used when free water is needed without additional electrolytes Caution is needed as it can cause hyponatremia if overused 4. 3% Saline: Used in the treatment of severe symptomatic hyponatremia Requires careful monitoring due to the risk of rapid sodium correction 5. 10% Dextrose: Used for treatment of hypoglycemia 6. Plasma-Lyte: A balanced electrolyte solution May be used for fluid resuscitation or as a maintenance fluid in some cases 7. Albumin Solutions: 5% or 25% albumin may be used in specific situations like burn management or certain types of shock 8. 5% Dextrose in 0.45% Normal Saline. Appropriate free water Glucose to prevent hypoglycemia and ketosis Sodium and chloride to maintain electrolyte balance 5% Dextrose in 0.45% Normal Saline is hypotonic and not suitable for rapid fluid resuscitation (Option A) 10% Dextrose is not preferred for initial rapid resuscitation, It is used for management of Hypoglycemia (Option C) Isolyte P is hypotonic (Na 23 mEq/L) and not appropriate for rapid fluid resuscitation (Option D) Reference: Ghai Essential Paediatrics, 10th Edition, Pages 58, 59.",

      "question": "Before performing radial artery cannulation on a 7-year-old child for continuous blood pressure monitoring during major surgery, the anesthesiologist compresses both the radial and ulnar arteries, asks the child to make a fist, then releases the ulnar artery while keeping the radial artery compressed. What is the primary purpose of this maneuver?",
      "options": {
        "A": "To assess the elasticity of the arterial walls",
        "B": "To evaluate collateral circulation in the hand",

        "D": "To check for arteriovenous malformations"
      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: B) To evaluate collateral circulation in the hand Explanation: This maneuver, known as the Modified Allen's test , is a non-invasive procedure used primarily to evaluate the collateral circulation in the hand before radial artery cannulation. Its main purposes are: To assess the patency and adequacy of the ulnar artery To evaluate the completeness of the palmar arch The test is performed as follows: Both ulnar and radial arteries are compressed. The child is asked to clench their fist several times to expel blood from the hand. The hand is then opened, appearing pale. Pressure on the ulnar artery is released while maintaining compression on the radial artery. If the hand flushes within 5-7 seconds, it indicates adequate collateral circulation through the ulnar artery. A positive test (rapid flushing) suggests that it's safe to proceed with radial artery catheterization , as the ulnar artery can adequately perfuse the hand if the radial artery is compromised during or after the procedure. A negative test , where the hand fails to flush within 5-15 seconds, suggests inadequate or absent ulnar circulation . In this case, avoid puncturing the radial artery, as it is the sole source of arterial blood to that hand. The test does not assess the elasticity of arterial walls. (Option A) This maneuver does not determine the size of the radial artery (Option C) The test is not designed to check for arteriovenous malformations (Option D)",

      },
      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: C) 850 ml RL Explanation: Fluid resuscitation: Parkland formula: Ringer Lactate Volume (mL) = 4 mL × weight (kg) × % TBSA burn The Modified Lund & Browder chart is essential for estimating the total body surface area (TBSA) affected by burns in children. According to this chart: For a 5-year-old child: Entire face (front half of head) = 6½% Front of thigh (half of thigh) = 4% Front of the leg (half of the leg) = 2¾% Therefore, the total affected area is: 6½% (face) + 4% (front of right thigh) + 2¾% (front of right leg) = 13.25% TBSA Treatment of Burns: Indications for inpatient care Third-degree burns at any age Second-degree burns >10% TBSA Burns involving the face, hands, or genitals Electrical, chemical, or inhalational injuries Burn patients with concomitant trauma Early management goals Adequate fluid replacement Correction of hypoxia and ventilatory disturbances Prevention of hypothermia Pain and anxiety control Wound care Nutrition Supportive care Fluid resuscitation Parkland formula: Ringer Lactate Volume (mL) = 4 mL × weight (kg) × % TBSA burn 4 ml x 16 x 13.25% = 848 ml of RL.

        "D": "Administer 1 mg/kg of hydrocortisone IV"
      },
      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: C) Give 20 mL/kg of normal saline as a rapid bolus Explanation: Shock is a state of inadequate tissue perfusion that can result from various etiologies, including hypovolemic, cardiogenic, distributive, or obstructive causes. The clinical features of shock in children include tachycardia, weak peripheral pulses, prolonged capillary refill time, cool extremities, altered mental status, and hypotension (a late sign in pediatric shock). Treatment of shock in children follows a stepwise approach: Initial Resuscitation Rapid administration of 10-20 mL/kg isotonic crystalloid (usually normal saline or Ringer's lactate) over 5-10 minutes. This can be repeated up to 60 mL/kg within the first hour if needed. Reassessment : After each fluid bolus, reassess for signs of improved perfusion and fluid overload. Vasoactive Medications If shock persists after adequate fluid resuscitation, initiate vasoactive drugs. Dopamine (5-20 mcg/kg/min) or epinephrine (0.05-0.3 mcg/kg/min) are commonly used first-line agents. Corticosteroids Consider hydrocortisone (2 mg/kg) in catecholamine-resistant shock or if adrenal insufficiency is suspected. Specific Therapies Antibiotics for suspected septic shock Blood products for hemorrhagic shock Antidotes for toxic shock Supportive Care Ensure adequate oxygenation and ventilation Correct electrolyte imbalances and hypoglycemia Maintain normothermia Continuous Monitoring: Vital signs, urine output, mental status, and perfusion markers should be closely monitored. Administering 20 mL/kg of normal saline over 1 hour is too slow for a child in shock. Rapid fluid resuscitation is crucial in the initial management (Option A) Starting dopamine infusion at this stage is premature. Vasoactive medications are considered after adequate fluid resuscitation and still the patient remains in shock (Option B) While hydrocortisone may be beneficial in certain types of shock (e.g., septic shock with suspected adrenal insufficiency), it is not the first-line treatment. Fluid resuscitation takes precedence (Option D) Reference: Ghai Essential Paediatrics, 10th Edition, Pages 767-770.",

      "explanation": "Correct Answer: B) 95 mL/kg/day Explanation: 95 mL/kg/day is the correct answer for a preterm infant weighing 1200 g on day 2 of life. Fluid management in neonates is crucial and varies based on factors such as gestational age, birth weight, and postnatal age. Fluid requirements for neonates: For neonates weighing <1500 g For neonates weighing ≥ 1500 g Day 1: 80 mL/kg/day Day 2: 95 mL/kg/day Day 3: 110 mL/kg/day Day 4: 120 mL/kg/day Day 5: 130 mL/kg/day Day 6: 140 mL/kg/day Day 7 and onwards: 150 mL/kg/day Day 1: 60 mL/kg/day Day 2: 75 mL/kg/day Day 3: 90 mL/kg/day Day 4: 105 mL/kg/day Day 5: 120 mL/kg/day Day 6: 135 mL/kg/day Day 7 and onwards: 150 mL/kg/day Preterm neonates have higher total body water and may lose up to 10-15% of birth weight during the first week of life.

      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: B) 1400 mL Explanation: The Holliday-Segar method is a widely used approach for calculating maintenance fluid requirements in children. It's based on the child's weight and provides an estimate of daily fluid needs. It estimates a child's energy expenditure in kilocalories and aligns it with their fluid needs. For every 100 kilocalories burned during metabolism, approximately 100 mL of fluid is required to replace the loss. The method assumes that each kilocalorie lost necessitates 1 mL of fluid for adequate replacement. The method uses the following formula: 100 mL/kg for the first 10 kg 50 mL/kg for the next 10 kg (11 - 20 kg) 20 mL/kg for each kg above 20 kg For this 18 kg child: First 10 kg: 10 x 100 mL = 1000 mL Next 8 kg: 8 x 50 mL = 400 mL Total: 1000 + 400 = 1400 mL Reference: Ghai Essential Paediatrics, 10th Edition, Page 57.",

        "C": "Excessive potassium intake",
        "D": "Rhabdomyolysis"
      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: B) Obstructive uropathy Explanation: The history of recurrent urinary tract infections suggests the possibility of an underlying urological abnormality. Obstructive uropathy can lead to impaired renal potassium excretion, resulting in hyperkalemia. Normal serum potassium level: 3.5-5.5 meq/L. Hyperkalemia is defined as a serum potassium level above 5.5 mEq/L. HYPERKALEMIA Etiology: Decreased renal excretion (acute kidney injury, chronic kidney disease, obstructive uropathy) Transcellular shifts (acidosis, cell lysis, rhabdomyolysis) Excessive intake (rare in children with normal renal function) Pseudohyperkalemia (hemolysis during blood draw) Endocrine disorders (adrenal insufficiency, hypoaldosteronism) Clinical features: Muscle weakness Fatigue Paralysis (in severe cases) Cardiac arrhythmias Often asymptomatic in mild cases Treatment: Prevent further progression of hyperkalemia Discontinue Potassium-Containing Substances Stabilize the Myocardial Membrane To prevent cardiac arrhythmias, administer IV calcium gluconate (10% solution) at a dose of 0.5-1 mL/kg over 5-10 minutes , with continuous cardiac monitoring. If bradycardia occurs, discontinue the infusion. Enhance Potassium Uptake into Cells : Regular Insulin and Glucose : Administer 0.3 units of regular insulin per gram of glucose IV over 2 hours . Sodium Bicarbonate : Infuse 1-2 mEq/kg body weight of sodium bicarbonate IV over 20-30 minutes . Beta-Adrenergic Agonists : Use nebulized or IV beta-agonists (e.g., salbutamol, terbutaline) to drive potassium into cells. Eliminate Potassium from the Body : Sodium Polystyrene Sulfonate (Kayexalate) : Administer 1 g/kg orally or via rectal enema, with a maximum dose of 15 g, mixed in 20-30% sorbitol. Diuretics : Consider loop or thiazide diuretics if renal function is adequate. Renal Replacement Therapy : For severe hyperkalemia, especially in cases of renal impairment or tumor lysis syndrome, hemodialysis or peritoneal dialysis may be required. For Hypoaldosteronism : Administer maintenance doses of steroids and fludrocortisone. For severe hyperkalemia (K+ >7.0 mEq/L) or when ECG changes (e.g., tall peaked T waves) are present, immediate treatment is necessary, starting with IV calcium gluconate, followed by sodium bicarbonate, insulin-glucose infusion, and/or nebulized beta-agonists. In refractory cases, hemodialysis may be needed. Mild hyperkalemia (5.5-6.5 mEq/L) should be managed by stopping potassium intake, discontinuing potassium-sparing drugs, and addressing the underlying cause. Congenital adrenal hyperplasia (Option A) : While this condition can cause electrolyte imbalances, it typically results in hypokalemia due to aldosterone deficiency. It's unlikely to cause hyperkalemia. Excessive potassium intake (Option C) : This is rarely a cause of hyperkalemia in children with normal renal function. The history doesn't suggest excessive intake. Rhabdomyolysis (Option D) : While this",

      "question": "A 4-year-old boy has been brought to the emergency department with severe vomiting for the past 2 days. He appears dehydrated and lethargic. Laboratory studies reveal: pH: 7.52 pCO2: 38 mmHg HCO3-: 32 mEq/L Na+: 138 mEq/L Cl-: 90 mEq/L Urinary Chloride: 10 mEq/L Which of the following is the MOST appropriate initial treatment for this patient's acid-base disorder?",

        "A": "Administer sodium bicarbonate",
        "B": "Provide oxygen therapy",
        "C": "Initiate normal saline infusion",
        "D": "Start acetazolamide"
      },
      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: C) Initiate normal saline infusion Explanation: The patient presents with metabolic alkalosis (pH > 7.45, increased HCO3-) likely due to severe vomiting. Also, the low urinary chloride (< 15 mEq/L) indicates a chloride-responsive metabolic alkalosis. The most appropriate treatment is to initiate normal saline infusion. Acid-Base Disorder Primary Cause Initial Treatment Additional Considerations Metabolic Acidosis Excess HCO3- loss or H+ retention Treat underlying cause Fluid resuscitation (e.g., normal saline) Start sodium bicarbonate (Option A) Sodium bicarbonate rarely used, only if pH < 7.1 or life-threatening Address electrolyte imbalances after initial resuscitation Respiratory Acidosis CO2 retention due to respiratory compromise Assisted ventilation (NIV/IMV) Treat underlying cause For every 10 mmHg increase in pCO2, there is 4 mEq/L rise in HCO3- (metabolic compensation) Metabolic Alkalosis (Chloride-Responsive) HCl loss (e.g., vomiting) Urinary chloride < 15 mEq/L Volume repletion with normal saline Most common type Responds to fluid and chloride replacement Metabolic Alkalosis (Chloride-Resistant) Various endocrine disorders Urinary chloride > 20 mEq/L Treat underlying cause May require specific treatments based on etiology (e.g., spironolactone for Liddle syndrome) Acetazolamide Does not respond to volume repletion alone Requires targeted therapy based on specific diagnosis Respiratory Alkalosis CO2 washout due to hyperventilation Treat underlying cause (e.g., fever, sepsis, asthma) Adjust ventilator settings if over ventilated Monitor for hypocalcemia (may cause tetany, seizures) Metabolic compensation occurs over days Provide oxygen therapy (Option B): Oxygen therapy is not indicated in the treatment of metabolic alkalosis. The patient's primary issue is related to fluid and electrolyte imbalances due to vomiting, not a respiratory or oxygenation problem. Start acetazolamide (Option D): Acetazolamide is a carbonic anhydrase inhibitor that can be used to correct metabolic alkalosis by increasing renal bicarbonate excretion. However, the immediate need is to address the underlying cause of the alkalosis, which in this case is due to chloride loss from vomiting. Normal saline is usually the initial treatment of choice.

      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: A) An activating mutation of sodium channels in the distal nephron Explanation: The patient experienced resistant hypertension, normal potassium levels and no significant kidney damage with family history of early-onset hypertension suggesting a genetic component. Thus, the patient is most likely suffering from Liddle syndrome. Liddle Syndrome: An autosomal dominant disorder Caused by an activating mutation in sodium channels in the collecting duct (distal part of nephron) (Option D) These sodium channels remain perpetually open This leads to sodium retention and resistant hypertension Differential diagnosis of Liddle Syndrome: (Common clinical feature: Hypertension) Glucocorticoid Remediable Aldosteronism (GRA): An autosomal dominant disorder It is characterized by overproduction of aldosterone thus causing hypertension Treatment involves glucocorticoids, which suppress ACTH production from the pituitary Reduced ACTH lowers aldosterone synthase production, thereby decreasing hypertension Apparent Mineralocorticoid Excess (AME): Caused by a deficiency in the 11 beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase enzyme Results in elevated cortisol levels and reduced cortisone levels in the kidney Elevated cortisol exhibits mineralocorticoid activity, leading to hypertension Hyperaldosteronism from adrenal hyperplasia (Option B) would generally cause hypokalemia due to excessive potassium excretion. A loss-of-function mutation in RAAS system (Option C) would usually result in reduced aldosterone production and potentially lower blood pressure, not resistant hypertension.
