It has been shown to reduce brain injury by slowing metabolic processes and is effective in improving neurodevelopmental outcomes in these infants. Hypoxic Ischemic Encephalopathy (HIE) Causes Antenatal: Maternal illness, obstructed labour, chorioamnionitis Natal: Obstructed labor, chorioamnionitis Postnatal: Congenital heart disease Effects Organ System Dysfunction: CNS, cardiac, renal, pulmonary, GI, haematological, metabolic Neuropathology: Selective neuronal necrosis, parasagittal injury, focal ischemic necrosis, periventricular injury Long-Term: Cerebral palsy, decreased IQ, learning impairments Diagnosis Clinical Grading: Sarnat score, Levene staging, Thompson score Imaging: MRI (most sensitive), CT scan, Ultrasound (preferred in preterm infants) MRI reveals increased cerebral cortex signal intensity and loss of grey-white matter differentiation. Management of HIE Supportive Care Oxygen Therapy: Ensure adequate oxygen levels. Fluid Management: Maintain blood flow and cerebral perfusion; avoid overhydration to prevent cerebral oedema. Temperature Control: Maintain normothermia; passive cooling is recommended for term infants with HIE. Blood Glucose Monitoring: Regular checks to prevent hypoglycemia. Infection Control: strict infection prevention measures. Specific Treatment Whole Body Cooling (Hypothermia): Effective in moderate to severe HIE, particularly for term infants Reduces brain damage by slowing metabolic processes. Temperature maintained 33.5 - 34.5 °C Long-Term Outcomes Survivors may face cerebral palsy, intellectual disability, and epilepsy. Immediate administration of high-dose corticosteroids (Option A) is not routinely used in the management of HIE, and they may increase the risk of complications like infection and hyperglycemia. Overhydration to prevent hypotension (Option C) is avoided as it can worsen cerebral oedema. Fluid management should be carefully balanced to maintain adequate blood flow and cerebral perfusion without overhydrating the infant. Hyperventilation to reduce intracranial pressure (Option D) is not recommended as a standard treatment in HIE and can lead to complications such as cerebral vasoconstriction, which may worsen the injury.",

Typical X-ray findings in RDS include: Ground glass haziness of lungs : Represents diffuse alveolar atelectasis, commonly seen in RDS. Presence of air bronchogram : Air-filled bronchi are visible against the hazy, collapsed alveoli, a classic feature of RDS.air bronchogram can be seen in parenchymal pathology of lung such as consolidation, pulmonary alveolar proteiniosis. Reticulogranular pattern: Another term for the ground-glass appearance, indicating the fine, granular pattern throughout the lungs characteristic of RDS. A box-shaped heart (Option B) is seen in the Ebstein anomaly; the heart appears box-shaped on X-ray due to the downward displacement of the tricuspid valve , resulting in right",

      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: C) Shake test Explanation: The procedure is the Foam test or shake test for fetal lung maturity. Fetal lung maturity tests (detect the adequacy of surfactant in amniotic fluid): Shake test/ Foam test/ Bubble test/ Clemen’s test (Option C) This is a bedside test, rapidly performed with a fair degree of accuracy. Amniotic fluid is mixed with 95% ethyl alcohol. Shake it vigorously for 10-15 minutes and then leave it for another 10-15 minutes. A complete ring of bubbles is seen at the meniscus, indicating a positive test for lung maturity. Lecithin: Sphingomyelin (L:S) ratio Estimation of pulmonary surfactant is done by lecithin/sphingomyelin (L/S ) ratio. The ratio at 31-32 weeks is 1 and at 35 weeks it is 2. L:S ratio ≥ 2 indicates pulmonary maturity. Phosphatidylglycerol estimation test (Option A) The presence of phosphatidylglycerol (PG) in amniotic fluid reliably indicates lung maturation. It is tested by thin-layer chromatography. Lamellar body count (Option B) Lamellar body is the storage form of surfactant in Type 2 pneumocytes, which can be detected in amniotic fluid. Mature lung: >30,000 / microlitre Amniotic fluid turbidity test (Option D) During the 1st and 2nd trimester, amniotic fluid is yellow and clear. At term, it is turbid due to the presence of vernix caseosa , a white, waxy substance that covers and protects the fetal skin and contributes to the fluid's opacity.

Explanation: Prophylactic antibiotics are not used in the initial management of RDS and are only given if infection, such as sepsis or pneumonia, is suspected. Routine use is not recommended due to the risk of antibiotic resistance. Management of RDS: Surfactant replacement therapy (Option A) is crucial for neonatal RDS. It addresses the lack of surfactant in premature infants, reducing alveolar surface tension and improving lung compliance and oxygenation. Continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) (Option B) is often used as a first-line treatment for RDS. It helps keep the airways open, improves oxygenation, and can reduce the need for mechanical ventilation. Mechanical ventilation (Option C): While not always the first choice, mechanical ventilation may be necessary for infants with severe RDS who don't respond adequately to CPAP or surfactant therapy.",

      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: B) 24-34 weeks Explanation: Antenatal corticosteroids are a crucial intervention in preventing Respiratory Distress Syndrome(RDS) in preterm infants. The timing of this intervention is crucial for its effectiveness. Between 24 - 34 weeks, when fetal lungs are rapidly developing and the risk of RDS is highest, corticosteroids can significantly accelerate lung maturation. Treatment: Inj. Betamethasone, 12 mg I.M, 2 doses, 24 hrs apart (OR) Inj. Dexamethasone, 6 mg I.M, 4 doses, 12 hrs apart Steroid of choice: Inj. Betamethasone has a slightly more neuroprotective effect: 20-24 weeks ( Option A): This is generally too early for corticosteroid administration. At this stage, the fetus's lungs are not developed enough to benefit significantly from the treatment. Additionally, survival rates for infants born at this gestational age are very low. 34-37 weeks(Option C): While some benefit may still be seen in this late preterm period, the standard recommendation for routine administration typically ends at 34 weeks. After this point, the risk-benefit ratio becomes less favourable as the incidence of RDS naturally decreases. 37-40 weeks(Option D): This is considered full term. By this point, the lungs are usually mature enough that RDS is uncommon, and the potential risks of corticosteroid administration may outweigh the benefits. Reference: O.P.

      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: B) Stimulation and provision of positive pressure ventilation Explanation: Current neonatal resuscitation guidelines no longer recommend routine intubation and tracheal suctioning for all meconium-stained infants . Instead, the recommended approach is to provide stimulation and positive pressure ventilation (PPV) if the infant shows poor respiratory effort or has a low heart rate. Meconium Aspiration Syndrome (MAS): It occurs when a newborn inhales meconium-stained amniotic fluid, which can cause airway obstruction, inflammation, and infection. Clinical Presentation: Respiratory distress, tachypnea, cyanosis, decreased breath sounds, and meconium staining on the skin or umbilical cord. Diagnosis : Based on clinical signs, with chest X-rays showing patchy infiltrates, hyperinflation, flattened diaphragms, increased lung radiolucency, and areas of atelectasis due to airway obstruction by meconium, leading to inflammation and air trapping. Treatment: Supportive respiratory care (oxygen therapy, positive pressure ventilation , mechanical ventilation if needed). Surfactant administration for severe cases and managing complications. Complications: Respiratory failure, persistent pulmonary hypertension (PPHN), pneumothorax, and, in severe cases, chronic lung disease. Surfactant administration (Option D) may be beneficial in severe cases, but it is not the initial step in management. Routine intubation and tracheal suctioning (Option A) are no longer recommended for all meconium-stained infants. Prophylactic antibiotics (Option C) are not indicated immediately unless there is evidence of infection; they may be considered later if risk factors are present.",

      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: C) Persistent hypoxemia requiring prolonged mechanical ventilation Explanation: Persistent hypoxemia requiring prolonged mechanical ventilation is not typical of Transient tachypnea of newborns (TTN); it usually self-limits, resolves within days, and rarely needs extended ventilation. Transient tachypnea of the newborn (TTN): A temporary respiratory condition in newborns characterised by rapid breathing (tachypnea), typically occurring shortly after birth. Cause : Delayed clearance of fetal lung fluid after birth. This fluid retention in the lungs makes breathing harder for the newborn. (Option D) Risk factors: Cesarean delivery (Option A) , maternal asthma, male gender, late preterm or early term birth, and macrosomia (large baby). Symptoms : Fast breathing (usually >60 breaths per minute), grunting, nasal flaring, mild chest retractions, and cyanosis. The newborn may also exhibit decreased feeding due to respiratory effort. Onset is usually within a few hours after birth and typically resolves within 24-72 hours. The diagnosis is based on the clinical presentation, chest X-ray showing fluid in the lungs, and exclusion of other respiratory conditions. Treatment : Primarily supportive care, including oxygen supplementation if needed, monitoring of vital signs, and sometimes continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP). Antibiotics may be started initially but discontinued if infection is ruled out. Prognosis : Generally excellent. Most cases resolve within 24-72 hours, though some may take up to 5 days. There are usually no long-term complications. (Option B) Reference: Nelson Textbook of Pediatrics, 21st edition, pg 941",

      "question": "A 27-week gestational-age preterm infant in the NICU experiences persistent apnea lasting over 20 seconds despite gentle tactile stimulation and supplemental oxygen.

        "D": "Start low-dose theophylline"
      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: B) Administer intravenous caffeine citrate Explanation: Caffeine is the treatment of choice for recurrent or persistent apnea of prematurity that does not respond to initial measures like tactile stimulation or nCPAP. It increases central respiratory drive, lowers the threshold for response to hypercapnia, enhances diaphragmatic contractility, and prevents diaphragmatic fatigue. Apnea of Prematurity: It is defined as the cessation of breathing for ≥ 20 seconds or more, or for any duration if accompanied by cyanosis or bradycardia, occurring in an infant born prematurely (<34 weeks GA) due to the immaturity of the central respiratory control mechanisms. It occurs in nearly all infants born at <28 weeks (Extreme preterm infants) and decreases in frequency with increasing gestational age. Management For mild and intermittent episodes: Gentle tactile stimulation or provision of supplemental oxygen by nasal cannula is often sufficient. If apnea episodes are more frequent or prolonged, nasal continuous positive airway pressure (nCPAP) or heated humidified high-flow nasal cannula (HHHFNC) can be used to maintain airway patency. For recurrent or persistent apnea: Methylxanthines (e.g., caffeine) are preferred because they effectively stimulate respiratory drive and reduce the incidence and severity of apnea. Caffeine aids in extubation and lowers Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) risk with fewer side effects than theophylline. It is safe for oral or intravenous use with a wide therapeutic window and minimal need for serum monitoring. Continuing nCPAP (Option A) is beneficial for managing obstructive or mixed apnea by maintaining airway patency but is less effective for central apnea. Since the apnea persists despite nCPAP, additional pharmacological intervention is needed. Initiate doxapram infusion (Option C): Doxapram is a respiratory stimulant but is less commonly used due to side effects and is typically considered only if methylxanthines are ineffective. Start low-dose theophylline (Option D): Theophylline is another methylxanthine but is less preferred than caffeine due to a shorter half-life and higher risk of side effects d/t narrow therapeutic range (5-15 microgram), such as tachycardia and feeding intolerance.

      "explanation": "Correct Answer: A) Bag and mask ventilation Explanation: Bag and Mask Ventilation is contraindicated in CDH patients due to the risk of worsening respiratory distress and increasing intrathoracic pressure, which can further impede lung expansion and exacerbate the hernia. Management of Congenital Diaphragmatic Hernia: Initial Stabilization: Airway Management: Immediate endotracheal intubation (ET) is critical . (Option B) ECMO: If there is no response to ET (Option C) Avoid excessive, mean airway pressure to prevent barotrauma Gastric Decompression: An orogastric tube is inserted to prevent gastric distention that worsens lung compression. (Option D) Bag and Mask Ventilation is Contraindicated in CDH Surgical Repair is done only after pulmonary stabilisation in CDH (Immediate surgery done in case of Traumatic Hernia) Reference: Nelson Textbook of Pediatrics 21st Edition, Pg - 945 Bailey & Love’s Short Practice of Surgery, 28th edition, Pg - 271",

      "question": "A 3-day-old newborn with congenital diaphragmatic hernia is in NICU showing signs of severe respiratory distress. Despite intensive management, the infant's condition deteriorates and leads to death. What is the most common cause of death in CDH?",
      "options": {
        "A": "Perforation of Herniated bowel",
        "B": "Pulmonary hypoplasia",

        "D": "All of the above"
      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: B) Pulmonary hypoplasia Explanation: In congenital diaphragmatic hernia (CDH), a defect in the fetal diaphragm causes abdominal contents to herniate into the thorax, which inhibits lung growth. The most common cause of death is pulmonary hypoplasia and its associated pulmonary hypertension. Clinically , it manifests with severe respiratory distress, decreased breath sounds on the affected side, and a scaphoid abdomen due to herniated abdominal contents. Cyanosis and mediastinal shift toward the unaffected side are also common. Management: Includes surgical repair, extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO), and supportive care. In-utero interventions. Prognosis and Mortality: Good Prognostic Factors: Mild CDH, postnatal repair, and absence of severe pulmonary hypoplasia. Poor Prognostic Factors: Severe pulmonary hypoplasia, severe pulmonary hypertension, need for ECMO, Liver herniation, Lung Heart Ratio<1, Symptoms within first 24 hrs. Perforation of the herniated bowel (Option A) is a severe complication in CDH leading to peritonitis or sepsis but is less common than pulmonary complications as a cause of death. Pulmonary Embolism (Option C) is a severe condition that can occur due to congenital heart defects or hypercoagulable states, and it is less common in CDH compared to pulmonary hypoplasia.
