      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer B- Portal vein thrombosis Explanation: The presentation of hematemesis and splenomegaly, along with the significant history of exchange transfusion in the neonatal period, strongly suggests portal vein thrombosis. This condition is a common cause of portal hypertension in children and can result from umbilical vein catheterization during exchange transfusion. Incorrect Options Splenic vein thrombosis (Option A) is also a possibility in a case of splenomegaly, but the history of exchange transfusion suggests a more generalized thrombotic event involving the portal vein. Budd-Chiari syndrome (Option C) is a condition characterized by the obstruction of hepatic veins, leading to liver congestion. It is less likely in this case, as the presentation of hematemesis and splenomegaly is more suggestive of portal vein involvement. Liver cirrhosis (Option D): Although it can cause portal hypertension, cirrhosis is uncommon in a 5-year-old without a history of chronic liver disease.
