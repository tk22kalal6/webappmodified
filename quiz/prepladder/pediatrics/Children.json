      "question": "An HIV-positive primigravida delivered a baby at 37 weeks of gestation. The baby cried immediately after birth, and samples for HIV testing were collected. The mother has been advised to exclusively breastfeed the baby. What is the recommended prophylactic regimen in this situation?",
      "options": {
        "A": "Nevirapine +/- Zidovudine",
        "B": "Zidovudine + Lamivudine + Nevirapine",
        "C": "Tenofovir + Lamivudine + Efavirenz",
        "D": "No prophylaxis needed"
      },
      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: A) Nevirapine +/- Zidovudine Explanation: In the above case, the preferred prophylaxis for the infant born to an HIV-positive mother is Nevirapine +/- Zidovudine for at least 12 weeks. Infants born to HIV-infected mothers will test positive for HIV antibodies at birth due to passive transfer from the mother, so IgG testing cannot diagnose HIV. Instead, the following tests can be performed: HIV RNA PCR HIV DNA PCR HIV culture In children >18 months old, HIV diagnosis can be confirmed by detecting IgG antibodies using ELISA or Western blot tests. A positive result requires confirmation with at least two tests. Risk Category Maternal Factors Low Risk On effective ART with suppressed viral load < 1,000 copies/mL High Risk Not on ART or high viral load ≥ 1,000 copies/mL Preterm delivery Rupture of membranes > 4 hours Low maternal CD4 count Maternal drug use HIV acquired during pregnancy Prophylaxis for infants born to HIV-positive mother Baby should receive prophylaxis irrespective of whether the mother has received ART or not. (Option D) The risk of HIV transmission through breastfeeding is highest during the early months, and if safe and sustainable alternatives are available, breastfeeding should be avoided. Currently, exclusive breastfeeding is recommended during the first months of life, as the benefits of breastfeeding far outweigh the risks. The regimen for prophylaxis is, Nevirapine +/- Zidovudine for at least 6 weeks In breastfed babies, Nevirapine +/- Zidovudine for at least 12 weeks Zidovudine + Lamivudine + Nevirapine (Option B) is the 1st line treatment regimen of HIV positive for infants I 2 weeks of age. Tenofovir + Lamivudine + Efavirenz (Option C) is the 1st line treatment regimen for HIV-positive adolescents.",

        "D": "Low-dose aspirin therapy"
      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: B) IVIG plus Methylprednisolone Explanation: The recommended initial treatment for managing MIS-C, with significant symptoms, involves a combination of intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) and corticosteroids (such as Methylprednisolone). This combined approach improves outcomes by reducing the hyper-inflammatory response. Management of MIS-C: Lab Diagnosis: Test for antibodies to nucleocapsid protein (avoid anti-spike protein as it may indicate past vaccination) Management: Supportive Care First-line treatment: A combination of IVIG and steroids is preferred. Steroids alone may be used in non-Kawasaki phenotypes (Option B) Treatment typically involves 3-5 days of IVIG and steroids, followed by a tapering course of oral steroids over 2-3 weeks. Additional Therapies: Low-Dose Aspirin: Administer 3-5 mg/kg (maximum 75 mg) for 6 weeks (Option D). Anticoagulation: Reserved for severe cases with low ejection fraction, documented thrombosis, or giant coronary aneurysms. Biologics: Consider infliximab, tocilizumab, or anakinra for refractory cases. Follow-up: Echocardiography: Recommended at 2 and 6 weeks, then as needed. Prognosis: Short-term mortality between 0-5%.

      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: B) Admit and administer O2, Remdesivir Explanation: The child with 92% oxygen saturation without any danger signs indicates Moderate disease for which hospital admission is required, and remdesivir is administered for saturation < 94% as it can help reduce the severity and duration of the illness. Management of COVID-19 in Children: Supportive Care: Primarily symptomatic and supportive. Avoid polypharmacy. Azithromycin, hydroxychloroquine, doxycycline, ivermectin, antibiotics, favipiravir, and convalescent plasma are not recommended . Monitoring: Parents should watch for red flags like persistent high fever, rapid breathing, and low oxygen saturation (<94%). Isolation: Mild cases can be deisolated 7 days from symptom onset, while severe cases require 14 days of isolation. Treatment Protocols: Mild Disease Home Management & Hydration Medications: Use paracetamol for fever and nasal saline drops for congestion. Avoid antibiotics and multivitamins (no proven benefit). Monitoring: Watch for red flag signs like rapid breathing, oxygen saturation below 95%, persistent fever, lethargy, or poor feeding. Moderate Disease Admit in Covid ward SpO2 > 94: Hydration, paracetamol and antimicrobials SpO2 < 94: Oxygen, IV Steroids, Remdesivir, Antimicrobials Severe/Critical Covid - 19 ICU / HDU ward Oxygen, CPAP, Invasive ventilation if required IV Steroids, Remdesivir, Enoxaparin, Antimicrobials Manage Shock, ARDS, AKI, and Myocarditis as per protocol Steroids: Administer IV dexamethasone at 0.15 mg/kg (max 6 mg) once daily for 5-14 days. Remdesivir should be administered only in a hospital setting. Enoxaparin: For <2 months: 1.5 mg/kg/dose every 12 hours. For >2 months: 1 mg/kg/dose every 12 hours. Home management with paracetamol and hydration (Option A) is done for only mild cases with Spo2>94% Immediate ICU admission and invasive ventilation (Option C) are not preferred as there are no immediate danger signs or severe symptoms (e.g., severe respiratory distress or shock) that would necessitate immediate ICU admission. Use of antibiotics and convalescent plasma (Option D) : Antibiotics are not recommended for COVID-19 unless there is a confirmed bacterial infection.

      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: C) Severe Explanation: According to ICMR, COVID-19 is classified as \"Severe\" when oxygen saturation is below 90% with signs of respiratory distress, such as intercostal retractions, which require immediate medical management. COVID-19: Causative Agent: SARS-CoV-2 Transmission Modes: Through droplets from breathing, coughing, and sneezing. Incubation Period: 2-14 days (mean: 5 days) The virus binds to ACE2 receptors, leading to various symptoms and complications. Symptoms : Fever, headache, fatigue, sore throat, cough, loss of taste/smell (initially) and severe cases leading to pneumonia, ARDS, thrombosis, and multi-organ dysfunction. Variants : Delta variant caused severe cases early, while Omicron resulted in higher transmissibility but milder disease. Diagnosis: RT-PCR Tests are the gold standard for detecting viral RNA in respiratory specimens. They have high specificity and a sensitivity of approximately 70-90%. Rapid Antigen Tests (RAT) : Lower sensitivity (30-50%) but high specificity. Negative RAT results should be confirmed with RT-PCR. Antibody Tests : Useful for epidemiological studies, not for acute infection. ICMR Criteria of COVID-19 Disease Severity: Features Saturation Mild URTI without lower respiratory tract involvement. > 94% Moderate Fast breathing (age-dependent) or hypoxemia 90-93% Severe Retractions, severe dehydration, drowsiness, or seizures. (Danger signs) <90% Critical Severe disease with ARDS, shock, multiorgan dysfunction syndrome, or acute thrombosis. - Reference: O.P. Ghai Essential Pediatrics, 10th Edition, Pg - 226,227",

        "D": "Reassurance and sending home"
      },
      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: A) IV antibiotic + Hospital admission Explanation: The given scenario is a case of severe pneumonia having danger signs and fast breathing which requires immediate hospital admission after 1st dose of IV antibiotics, preferably ampicillin and gentamicin. Acute lower respiratory tract infection (LRTI) is a leading cause of mortality in children below 5 years of age. Common bacteria causing LRTI in preschool children include H. influenzae, S. pneumoniae and. Staphylococci. According to the latest IMNCI (Integrated Management of Neonatal & Childhood Illness) guidelines, assessing a child with breathing difficulties or a cough involves counting breaths per minute, checking for chest indrawing, observing for stridor and wheeze and identifying any danger signs. Danger signs include convulsions, lethargy, inability to drink or breastfeed, persistent vomiting, unconsciousness, stridor in a calm child . Fast breathing is assessed as, < 2 months: > 60/ min 2-12 months: > 50/ min 1-5 years: > 40/ min Management: Category Signs/symptoms Treatment No Pneumonia (cough or cold only) (Option C) No signs of rapid breathing, chest indrawing, or general danger signs. Home-based supportive care Pneumonia (Option B) Presence of either chest indrawing or rapid breathing, but no danger signs. Start oral Amoxicillin for 5 days. The child is sent home and will be reassessed after 48 hours. If the child has improved, continue with the same treatment. If the child's condition has worsened, refer to a higher level of care. Severe Pneumonia (Option A) Presence of danger signs Administer the first dose of Inj. Ampicillin and Gentamicin, then urgently refer the patient to the hospital. Reassurance and sending home (Option D) won’t be enough as this is an emergency situation which requires hospital admission. Reference: Nelson Textbook of Pediatrics, 21st Edition, pg 29. O.P.

      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: B) HIV RNA PCR test Explanation: In infants born to HIV-positive mothers, antibody tests (Option A) are not reliable for diagnosing HIV infection due to the presence of maternal antibodies . Instead, the best method to confirm or exclude HIV infection is through direct detection of the virus through techniques like PCR. Maternal Antibodies: Infants born to HIV-positive mothers will test positive for HIV antibodies due to passive transfer from the mother. These antibodies typically disappear in uninfected infants by 6-18 months, but some may persist up to 24 months. Diagnosis of HIV in Infants: < 24 Months Antibody Tests: Not reliable for definitive diagnosis due to maternal antibody presence. IgA (Option C) & IgM Tests: Not clinically useful d/t poor sensitivity and specificity. Viral Diagnostic Tests: HIV DNA PCR: Highly sensitive and specific by two weeks of age. HIV RNA PCR: Similar to DNA PCR. > 24 Months IgG Antibody Tests: Reliable if repeatedly positive, confirmed with HIV PCR. Testing Protocols Rapid HIV Tests (Option D) are useful for immediate diagnosis in newborns, but positive results must be confirmed with a second test or PCR. For breastfed infants , test 12 weeks after breastfeeding ends to detect any potential infection acquired through lactation. High-Risk Infants: Initial viral testing within the first 12-24 hours, followed by additional tests at 2-3 weeks, 4-8 weeks, and 4-6 months if needed. Definitive Diagnosis For non-breastfed infants, HIV infection can be excluded with Two negative virologic tests at ≥ 1 month and ≥ 4 months Two negative antibody tests at ≥ 6 months.

      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: B) Flaccid paralysis with absent reflexes Explanation: Poliomyelitis often leads to flaccid paralysis because it primarily affects the anterior horn cells in the spinal cord , which are responsible for motor control resulting in muscle weakness and atrophy. Reflexes may be diminished or absent due to the disruption of the motor neurons. Poliovirus (Family: Picornaviridae) Transmission: Fecal-oral route Incubation Period: 8-12 days from exposure to the onset of symptoms. It has three serotypes: PV1, PV2, and PV3 Pathogenesis: The virus spreads from the intestinal tract to the central nervous system (CNS), potentially causing aseptic meningitis and poliomyelitis. Types of Poliovirus Infections: Inapparent Infection 90-95% of cases; asymptomatic Abortive Poliomyelitis Mild, flu-like symptoms with full recovery Nonparalytic Poliomyelitis More severe symptoms, including neck stiffness and pain, with a good prognosis Paralytic Poliomyelitis Includes spinal, bulbar, and polio encephalitis forms, presenting with various degrees of paralysis Diagnosis: Consider polio in any unimmunised child with acute flaccid paralysis , particularly in areas with past or current polio cases. Isolation of poliovirus from stool specimens collected 24-48 hours apart. Management: Supportive care is primary; ventilatory support may be necessary for severe respiratory involvement. Prevention (Vaccination): Oral Polio Vaccine (OPV): Live attenuated vaccine administered orally that induces both systemic & mucosal immunity with a risk of vaccine-associated polio. Inactivated Polio Vaccine (IPV): Killed virus vaccine. Given via injection that provides systemic immunity without the risk of vaccine-derived polio. Spastic paralysis with hyperreflexia (Option A ) is more characteristic of upper motor neuron lesions , which are not typical of poliomyelitis.

This virus causes cell lysis and depletion of erythroid precursors, leading to transient arrest of erythropoiesis , which exacerbates anemia in children with sickle cell disease . Clinical Manifestations and Complications of Parvovirus B19 Infection Low grade fever, malaise, URTI. Erythema infectiosum (Fifth Disease): Characterized by a \"slapped-cheek\" rash followed by a lacy, reticular rash on the body. Arthropathy: Common in adults, presenting as arthritis or arthralgia. Transient Aplastic Crisis: Severe anaemia in individuals with chronic hemolytic anaemia. Fetal Infection: Risk of nonimmune fetal hydrops and stillbirth typically results in normal deliveries. Papular purpural gloves and socks syndrome Myocarditis Epstein-Barr virus (Option B) causes infectious mononucleosis, characterised by fever, sore throat, lymphadenopathy, and splenomegaly. It mainly infects B cells and does not target erythroid progenitor cells like Parvovirus B19. Cytomegalovirus (Option C) typically causes asymptomatic or mild illness in immunocompetent individuals but leads to severe disease and anemia in immunocompromised patients due to bone marrow suppression, without causing an aplastic crisis. Human Herpesvirus 6 (Option D) (HHV-6) causes roseola in young children, characterised by high fever and rash, and can cause febrile seizures. It affects T cells without disrupting erythropoiesis.

      "explanation": "viral infection, especially in children. Management typically involves supportive care, including maintaining hydration and monitoring liver function. Hepatitis A: Etiology: Hepatitis A Virus (HAV) is an RNA virus from the Picornavirus family. Epidemiology: HAV is highly contagious, transmitted primarily through the fecal-oral route. Incubation period: ~3 weeks. Contagious (viral shedding) from late in the incubation period until about 2 weeks after the onset of jaundice. Clinical Manifestations: HAV causes acute hepatitis only. Often anicteric in young children, but symptomatic in older adolescents, adults, and immunocompromised patients. Symptoms : Acute febrile illness with abrupt onset of anorexia, nausea, malaise, vomiting, and jaundice. Duration of illness: 7-14 days. Category Details Diagnosis Anti-HAV IgM antibodies: Detectable during symptoms and remains positive for 4-6 months. Anti-HAV IgG antibodies: Provides long-term immunity and appears within 8 weeks of symptom onset. Elevated levels: ALT, AST, bilirubin, alkaline phosphatase, 5 ′ -nucleotidase, γ -glutamyl transpeptidase. Complications Full recovery is typical. Acute liver failure (ALF): Rare, particularly in older adolescents, adults, and immunocompromised patients. Prolonged cholestatic syndrome: Leads to pruritus and fat malabsorption, resolves without long-term effects. Acute Relapsing Hepatitis Fulminant hepatitis (Acute Hepatitis E > A) Treatment Supportive care: Intravenous hydration, antipruritic agents, and fat-soluble vitamin supplementation for cholestatic disease. Monitor for signs of ALF. Prevention Vaccine: Two inactivated vaccines, administered intramuscularly in a 2-dose schedule (second dose 6-12 months after the first). Recommended for children >12 months. Isolation: Infected individuals should be isolated for 2 weeks before and 1 week after jaundice onset. Hand hygiene. Immunoglobulin (Ig) Prophylaxis: For preexposure and postexposure prophylaxis, especially in children <12 months, immunocompromised individuals, those with chronic liver disease, and those allergic to the vaccine. Prognosis Excellent prognosis with no long-term sequelae. Start antiviral therapy (Option A): Hepatitis A virus (HAV) infection typically does not require antiviral therapy. The treatment is generally supportive as the infection is usually self-limiting. Administer Hepatitis A vaccine (Option B): The vaccine is used for prevention,",
