      },
      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: A) Neonatal Sepsis Explanation: The combination of respiratory distress( grunting, nasal flaring, and intercostal retractions), hypothermia( 35.8 °C), poor perfusion( 42 mm Hg systolic), and a low white blood cell count with a high percentage of bands points to Neonatal sepsis. Clinical Features of Neonatal Sepsis: Early Signs: Poor feeding Temperature Disturbances: Hypothermia (more common than fever) Metabolic Issues: Hypoglycemia metabolic acidosis elevated lactate Systemic Manifestations: CNS: Shrill cry, irritability, seizures, abnormal posturing, bulging anterior fontanelle Respiratory: Tachypnea, hypoxia, retractions, grunting GI: Abdominal distension, feed intolerance, recurrent vomiting, necrotizing enterocolitis-like features Severe Sepsis: Septic shock, Multi-organ dysfunction, DIC Sclerema: Generalized non-pitting edema due to severe sepsis or hypothermia Respiratory Distress Syndrome (Option B): Presents with respiratory distress but does not commonly cause significant hypothermia or systemic signs such as poor perfusion and low blood pressure. Transient Tachypnea of the Newborn (Option C): Presents with respiratory distress but usually resolves quickly without the systemic involvement seen in this case. Meconium Aspiration Syndrome (Option D): MAS typically does not cause hypothermia or the profound leukopenia and bandemia observed here.

      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: A) Low dose Aspirin Explanation Low-dose aspirin (50 mg daily) is recommended for women at risk of IUGR, particularly those with a history of hypertension or other factors that may impair placental blood flow. It helps improve placental perfusion and reduce the risk of growth restriction. Prevention of IUGR: Correct malnutrition: With an extra 300 calories per day Balanced energy/protein supplementation is associated with 30% reduction in risk of IUGR. Low-Dose Aspirin: 50 mg daily in very selected cases with a history of thrombotic disease, hypertension, pre-eclampsia, or recurrent FGR is associated with 10% reduction in risk of IUGR. Anti-oxidants (Vit. C & Vit. E): No reduction in risk of IUGR (Option C ruled out) Restriction of caffeine intake: is associated with reduction in risk of IUGR (Option B ruled out) Avoid all forms of exercise (Option D ruled out): Avoiding all forms of exercise is not necessary and could negatively impact overall maternal health. Moderate exercise, unless contraindicated, is usually encouraged. Reference: DC Dutta’s Textbook of Obstetrics, 9th Edition, Pages 434, 435",

        "D": "Very late-onset sepsis occurring more than 10 days after birth"
      },
      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: C) Late-onset sepsis occurring beyond 7 days of life Explanation: The infant is 14 days old , which clearly places the infection in the late-onset sepsis category (beyond 7 days of life). Features such as poor feeding , respiratory distress , and fever , in association with risk factors like poor cord care , support the diagnosis. Parameter Early-Onset Sepsis Late-Onset Sepsis Timing Within the first 72 hours of life, but can occur up to day 7 of life (Options A and B ruled out) Begins beyond the first week of life (Option D ruled out) Common Organisms Derived from maternal genital tract: Group B Streptococcus, E. coli, Klebsiella Community-acquired (e.g., S.aureus), Nosocomial (e.g., Acinetobacter, Klebsiella Risk factors Spontaneous onset of preterm labor Prolonged rupture of membranes (>18 hours) Foul-smelling liquor Multiple per vaginal Examinations Maternal fever Prolonged labor Poor hand hygiene LBW Lack of breastfeeding Poor cord care Superficial infections (pyoderma, umbilical sepsis) Aspiration of feeds Needle pricks Use of IV fluids.

        "D": "Decreased absolute neutrophil count as per Mouzinho’s chart."
      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: B) Total leukocyte count < 5000 Explanation: In neonatal sepsis, a total leukocyte count of less than 5000 is included in a sepsis screen. Diagnosis of Neonatal Sepsis (NNS): Diagnosing sepsis, especially in neonates, can be challenging due to its overlap with other conditions like hypothermia, hyperthermia, and hypoglycemia. It’s crucial to conduct a thorough clinical examination and relevant investigations to distinguish sepsis from other potential causes and avoid unnecessary antibiotic treatment. Investigations in NNS: For a high probability sepsis case , treatment should start immediately without waiting for investigations . Blood cultures are essential for definitive diagnosis and should be collected before initiating antimicrobial therapy. A sepsis screen includes: Components Abnormal values Total Leucocyte count (TLC) <5000/mm 3 (Option B) Absolute Neutrophil Count (ANC) Low counts as per Manroe chart for term infants Mouzinho’s chart for VLBW infants Immature/Total neutrophil (IT) >0.2 Micro-ESR >15mm in 1st hour C-reactive protein >1 mg/dl A positive sepsis screen is indicated by at least two abnormal parameters. A lumbar puncture is recommended for all suspected cases of neonatal sepsis (NNS), except for asymptomatic infants being evaluated solely for maternal risk factors. Increased total leucocyte count (Option A ruled out) and Increased neutrophil count (Option C ruled out) can be ruled out from the above table for sepsis screen. In screening a term neonate for sepsis, the decreased neutrophil count is evaluated using Manroe's chart rather than Mouzinho's chart (Option D ruled out) .

      },
      "correct_answer": "D",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: D) IV Cefotaxime and Gentamicin for 21 days Explanation: In confirmed neonatal meningitis, the recommended antibiotic regimen includes a third-generation cephalosporin like Cefotaxime, often in combination with Gentamicin, for a duration of 21 days to ensure complete eradication of the infection and prevent complications. Treatment of Neonatal Sepsis: Oral antibiotics (Option A ruled out) have no role in the treatment of Neonatal Sepsis. Intravenous broad spectrum antibiotics are the treatment of choice. In case of suspicion or confirmed meningitis, 3rd generation cephalosporin like cefotaxime (Option D) (Option C ruled out) should be added.

      "explanation": "Correct Answer: C) I and II Explanation: KMC is recommended for all low birth weight infants, not just those under 1500 grams. KMC does not have to be performed continuously for 24 hours to be effective; shorter, practical periods of KMC are also beneficial. Kangaroo Mother Care (KMC): KMC was first suggested in 1978 by Dr Edgar Rey in Bogota, Colombia, for the prevention of neonatal hypothermia in low birth weight/ premature newborns. Kangaroo Mother Care (KMC) can be carried out by the mother or any other caregiver. Components: Kangaroo positioning: Skin-to-skin positioning of the newborn on the mother's chest. Kangaroo nutrition: Adequate nutrition through breastfeeding. Early discharge and ambulatory care. Studies suggest: It is as good as incubators, in terms of safety and thermal protection. (Statement IV) Reduces severe morbidity. Promoted bonding between mother and child. It is indicated for all hemodynamically stable low birth weight babies . (Statement I). Short sessions of KMC (Statement II) can be initiated in babies on medical treatment like IV fluids or oxygen therapy. Initiation of KMC can vary with the birth weight of the baby. Positioning for KMC: The baby is placed between the mother's breast in an upright position. The hips are abducted and flexed in the frog position and the arms are also flexed. The abdomen of the baby should be at the level of the mother's epigastrium. In this position, the mother's breathing would stimulate the baby and prevent the development of apnea. The duration of KMC should be gradually increased from short sessions of more than one hour to 24 hours a day. KMC is not necessary once the baby attains 2500 g of weight or 37 weeks of gestation.
