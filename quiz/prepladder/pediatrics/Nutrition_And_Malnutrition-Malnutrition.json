      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Correct answer: B) Moderate Stunting Explanation: Stunting is indicated by low height-for-age, falling between -2 and -3 SDS , which suggests chronic malnutrition. This child’s growth has been stunted due to long-term inadequate nutrition. Severe Acute Malnutrition (SAM)(Option A): SAM is characterized by severe wasting, a weight-for-height below -3 SDS, or bilateral oedema. This child does not have these symptoms. Moderate Wasting (Option C): Wasting refers to low weight-for-height, typically indicating acute malnutrition. The child’s weight for height is normal, so wasting is not present. Severe Underweight (Option D): Underweight refers to low weight-for-age. Although underweight can be associated with both wasting and stunting, the child's weight-for-height is normal, ruling out underweight as the primary issue. WHO Classification of Malnutrition Moderately underweight Weight-for-age is between -2 and -3 SDS. Severely underweight Weight-for-age is < -3 SDS. Moderately wasted Weight-for-length/height is between -2 and -3 SDS. Severely wasted Weight-for-length/height is < -3 SDS. Moderate Acute Malnutrition Weight-for-length/height or BMI-for-age is between -2 and -3 SDS. Mid-upper arm circumference (MUAC) is between 11.5 cm and 12.5 cm. Severe Acute Malnutrition: Weight-for-length/height or BMI-for-age is less than -3SDS. MUAC is less than 11.5 cm. The presence of bilateral pitting oedema. Moderately Stunted (Moderate Chronic Malnutrition) Length/height-for-age is between -2 and -3 SDS. Severely Stunted (Severe Chronic Malnutrition) Length/height-for-age is < -3 SDS.

      "question": "A 2 year old malnourished child is assessed using mid-upper arm circumference (MUAC), and the measurement is 10 cm. What does this indicate?",
      "options": {
        "A": "Moderate Stunting",
        "B": "Severe Wasting",
        "C": "Chronic Malnutrition",
        "D": "Obesity"
      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Correct answer: B) Severe Wasting Explanation: A MUAC measurement significantly below the recommended threshold (11.5 cm between 6 months to 5 years of age) typically indicates severe wasting . Wasting is a form of acute malnutrition where the child has a skinny appearance due to recent and severe weight loss. Therefore, a low MUAC strongly suggests severe wasting. Mid-upper arm circumference (MUAC) is considered an age-independent measure for assessing malnutrition. It provides a general indication of acute malnutrition without needing to adjust for the child's age, making it a versatile tool for screening across various age groups within its applicable range. Moderate Stunting (Option A): It is assessed using height-for-age measurements, which reflect long-term nutritional status and growth. MUAC is not used to diagnose stunting; thus, a low MUAC measurement would not indicate moderate stunting. Chronic Malnutrition (Option C): It is associated with long-term nutritional deficiencies and is evaluated through height-for-age measurements that show stunting. MUAC is more suited for detecting acute malnutrition rather than chronic malnutrition. Obesity (Option D) is identified through high BMI or weight-for-height measurements, not by a low MUAC. Since MUAC is used to assess acute malnutrition, it cannot indicate obesity.

      "question": "A 2 y/o child from a rural area presents to the clinic with severe wasting, prominent ribcage, and a \"baggy pants\" appearance due to loose skin on the buttocks. Despite the child's emaciated state, they remain mentally alert. What is the most likely diagnosis?",
      "options": {
        "A": "Kwashiorkor",
        "B": "Marasmus",
        "C": "Mild Malnutrition",
        "D": "Obesity"
      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Correct answer: B) Marasmus Explanation: Kwashiorkor (Option A ruled out) Marasmus (Option B) Pitting Edema: Characterized by swelling, often starting in the legs and feet, leaving a persistent indentation when pressed. Severe Wasting: The child appears extremely thin, with prominent bones and little body fat. Sugar Baby Appearance: The child may look deceptively healthy due to oedema, despite being malnourished. Monkey Facies: A sunken appearance of the cheeks due to loss of fat, giving an aged look. Muscle Wasting: Despite the swollen appearance, muscle loss is present, leading to weakness and hypotonia. Baggy Pants Appearance: Loose, sagging skin around the buttocks caused by significant muscle and fat loss. Mental and Neurological Symptoms: The child is apathetic, irritable, and may have feeding difficulties. Alertness: Children with marasmus remain mentally alert. Hair Changes: Hair may lose colour, become thin, and show alternating bands of colour (\"flag sign\"). Absence of Edema: Unlike kwashiorkor, marasmus does not involve swelling or oedema. Skin Changes: Includes hyperpigmentation, peeling skin (\"flaky paint\" appearance), and colour changes, particularly in the buttocks, perineum, and thighs. Hypoglycemia Risk: The liver's reduced capacity to produce glucose increases the risk of low blood sugar. Gastrointestinal Issues: Anorexia, vomiting, and abdominal distension. Anaemia is present due to nutritional deficiencies. Hypothermia Risk: The child may struggle to maintain body temperature due to energy depletion. Mild Malnutrition (Option C): Mild malnutrition does not present with such severe symptoms as wasting and an emaciated appearance. Obesity (Option D): Obesity is characterized by excessive fat accumulation, which is the opposite of the symptoms described in the scenario.

      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Correct answer: B) Severe Acute Malnutrition Explanation: Severe Acute Malnutrition is the correct option, characterized by severe wasting (MUAC < 11.5 cm) and the presence of bilateral oedema, both of which are diagnostic criteria for SAM. SAM requires immediate medical attention due to its life-threatening nature. Definition of SAM - can have any of the 3 criteria. Mild Acute Malnutrition (Option A): This refers to a less severe form of malnutrition where weight and MUAC are below normal but not critically low as seen in SAM. The presence of bilateral oedema and a MUAC of 11 cm indicates a more severe condition. Moderate Acute Malnutrition (Option C) is when a child shows moderate wasting, with a MUAC that is lower than normal but higher than the threshold for severe malnutrition (typically between 11.5 cm and 12.5 cm). Chronic Malnutrition (Option D): It is characterized by stunting, where a child is shorter for their age due to long-term nutritional deficiency. The key features in this scenario -acute wasting and edema are more consistent with severe acute malnutrition, not chronic malnutrition.

      "question": "A 2 y/o child is diagnosed with severe acute malnutrition (SAM) and is admitted to the hospital. On admission, the child is found to have hypoglycemia and starts showing signs of hypothermia. Which of the following is the most likely complication of SAM that the child is experiencing?",
      "options": {
        "A": "Refeeding Syndrome",
        "B": "Electrolyte Imbalance",
        "C": "Dehydration",
        "D": "Metabolic Disturbances"
      },
      "correct_answer": "D",
      "explanation": "Correct answer: D) Metabolic Disturbances Explanation: SAM is characterized by significant metabolic disturbances, including hypoglycemia (due to impaired gluconeogenesis in the liver) and hypothermia (due to reduced metabolic rate and loss of body fat). The symptoms presented in the scenario align closely with these disturbances, making this the most likely complication the child is experiencing. Refeeding Syndrome (Option A) is a serious complication that can occur when feeding is reintroduced too rapidly in malnourished patients, leading to dangerous shifts in fluids and electrolytes. Although it is a known risk during the treatment of SAM, the symptoms present as breathlessness, rapid pulse, and watery diarrhoea which are not seen in this patient. Electrolyte Imbalance (Option B) particularly involving potassium, magnesium, and sodium, is common in children with SAM and can lead to complications like cardiac arrhythmias and muscle weakness. However, the symptoms described (hypoglycemia and hypothermia) are more indicative of metabolic disturbances. Dehydration (Option C): Dehydration can occur in malnourished children due to inadequate fluid intake, diarrhea, or other factors. However, dehydration typically presents with signs such as dry mucous membranes, sunken eyes, decreased skin turgor, and low blood pressure, none of which are specifically noted in this child. The presentation of hypoglycemia and hypothermia strongly suggests metabolic disturbances related to refeeding rather than dehydration alone.",

      "question": "A 10-month-old with SAM was treated with F75 and transitioned to F100 and RUTF after the oedema resolved and appetite returned. The child has gained 6 grams/kg/day. Which of the following is NOT an appropriate discharge criterion? days.",
      "options": {
        "A": "The child has shown consistent weight gain of more than 5 grams/kg/day for at least 3 consecutive",
        "B": "The child's oedema has resolved.",
        "C": "The child has been switched from F75 to F100.",
        "D": "The child has received all necessary vaccinations."
      },
      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: C) The child has been switched from F75 to F100 Explanation: Switching to F100 is NOT sufficient for discharge. Discharge criteria require resolution of medical issues, sufficient weight gain, and clinical stability. SAM- Nutritional Rehabilitation Phase and Discharge Nutritional Rehabilitation Entry to Rehabilitation Phase: Indicated by reduced or minimal oedema and a return of appetite. Transition Process: Duration: Over 3 days to prevent refeeding syndrome. Method: Replace F75 with an equal volume of F100 for 2 days. Gradual Increase: Increase feed volume by 10 mL at each feeding until some feed remains uneaten (around 200 mL/kg/day). Post-Transition Feeding: Feeds: Provide unlimited amounts of high-energy, high-protein milk formula like F100 (100 kcal and 3 g protein per 100 mL), ready-to-use therapeutic food (RUTF), or modified family foods with similar energy and protein content. (Option C) Calories and Protein: Offer 150-220 kcal/kg/day and 4-6 g protein/kg/day. Supplements: Continue potassium, magnesium, and micronutrients. Add iron at 3 mg/kg/day. Breastfeeding: Encourage continued breastfeeding if applicable. RUTF Standard ready-to-use therapeutic food (RUTF) usually contains milk powder, sugar, peanut butter, vegetable oil, vitamins, and minerals. It has a long shelf life and low moisture content- preventing the growth of pathogens. When using RUTF: Begin with small, frequent meals of RUTF, aiming for 8 meals per day initially and then reducing to 5–6 meals per day. If the child cannot consume the full RUTF portion at each meal, supplement with F-75 to complete the meal until they can eat the full amount of RUTF. If the child is unable to consume at least half of the recommended RUTF amount within 12 hours, discontinue RUTF and provide F-75 instead. Reintroduce RUTF after 1–2 days and continue this approach until the child can consume sufficient RUTF. If the child is still breastfeeding, offer breast milk before each RUTF feeding. Discharge criteria All medical issues, including oedema, are resolved for 2 weeks (Option B) They have completed parenteral antibiotic treatment and the infant is clinically stable and alert. The infant is either breastfeeding effectively or feeding well. The weight gain is satisfactory, such as being above the median of WHO growth velocity standards or gaining more than 5g/kg/day for at least 3 consecutive days. (Option A) Before discharge, check and provide any missing vaccinations and routine interventions as needed. Ensure that mothers or caregivers are connected with appropriate community follow-up and support. (Option D)",

      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: B) Achieve a 2% annual reduction in under-nutrition Explanation: One of the specific targets of POSHAN Abhiyaan is to achieve a 2% annual reduction in undernutrition among children, women, and adolescent girls. POSHAN ABHIYAAN Prime minister's overarching scheme for holistic nutrition. Launch : POSHAN Abhiyaan was launched by Prime Minister Narendra Modi in Jhunjhunu, Rajasthan, in March 2018. Objectives : The initiative targets reduction in under-nutrition, stunting, anaemia (in children, women, and adolescent girls), and low birth weight by coordinating various nutrition schemes. Improve nutrition in 1st 1000 days of life (including the antenatal period and 2 years after birth). Implementation : The program utilizes existing structural arrangements of line ministries and will be scaled up with support from the World Bank's ISSNIP project to all districts by 2022. Annual Targets : Reduce stunting by 2% per year. Reduce Undernutrition by 2% per year (Option B). Reduce Anemia by 3% per year. Reduce low birth weight by 2% per year. Stunting Reduction Goal : Strives to decrease stunting from 38.4% (NFHS-4) to 25% by 2022, with a target of at least a 2% annual reduction. Increase the average weight of children by 5 kg per year (Option A): POSHAN Abhiyaan does not target increasing the average weight of children by a specific amount annually. Instead, it aims to reduce various forms of malnutrition. Eliminate all forms of malnutrition by 2022 (Option C): POSHAN Abhiyaan does not aim to eliminate all forms of malnutrition by 2022 but focuses on reducing stunting, under-nutrition, anaemia, and low birth weight. Provide free school meals to all children (Option D): This refers to the Mid-Day Meal Program also called the PM POSHAN (POshan SHAkti Nirman) Scheme , a separate initiative. The Mid-Day Meal Program aims to provide free meals to children in government primary and upper primary schools, government-aided Anganwadis, Madarsa, and Maqtabs on working days, except for school holidays, primarily to improve nutritional status and encourage school attendance, especially among disadvantaged children.",

      "explanation": "Correct Answer: A) Measure from the acromion to the olecranon and mark the midpoint Explanation: MID UPPER ARM CIRCUMFERENCE (MUAC) Definition MUAC is a vital measurement used primarily to assess the nutritional status of children aged 6 months to 5 years. (Option B) Quick and effective screening tool. In infants under 6 months old, the Mid-Upper Arm Circumference (MUAC) is not utilized as a measurement criterion. (G88) Procedure Ensure the child is standing straight with their left arm free of clothing. The arm should be bent at a right angle. Measure the distance between the tip of the shoulder (acromion) and the tip of the elbow (olecranon). Mark the midpoint on the upper arm. (Option A) The child's arm should hang relaxed by their side, with the palm facing the thigh. Use a MUAC tape to wrap around the marked midpoint of the arm. The tape should be snug but not tight enough to pinch the skin. Record the measurement at the zero mark of the tape. Shakir’s Tape Shakir's tape is a specific type of MUAC measuring tape designed for use in assessing malnutrition. It is typically three colour-coded to facilitate easy interpretation of nutritional status. The tape is marked with different zones that correspond to various levels of malnutrition: Red Zone: Indicates severe malnutrition (MUAC < 11.5 cm ). Yellow Zone: Indicates moderate malnutrition (MUAC between 11.5 cm and 12.5 cm ).
