      "explanation": "Correct Answer: B) Gaucher disease Explanation: The given findings are characteristic of Gaucher disease, an autosomal recessive lysosomal storage disorder caused by mutations in the GBA gene , which encodes the enzyme glucocerebrosidase . This enzyme deficiency leads to the accumulation of glucocerebroside (glucosylceramide) within lysosomes of macrophages, forming characteristic Gaucher cells. Clinical Features: Hematologic: Pancytopenia Skeletal: Bone crisis, severe bone pain. Neurological: Parkinsonism, cognitive impairment, neuropathy . Investigations: Bone marrow examination: Shows Gaucher cells with a characteristic wrinkled tissue paper appearance. Gaucher cells are macrophages accumulated with glucocerebroside Enzyme assay: Demonstrates reduced activity of glucocerebrosidase in leukocytes or fibroblasts. Long bone X-rays may show the Erlenmeyer flask deformity. Management : Enzyme replacement therapy (ERT): Imiglucerase, velaglucerase alfa, or taliglucerase alfa Substrate reduction therapy: Miglustat or eliglustat Supportive care: Blood transfusions, pain management, orthopaedic interventions Flask deformity\" data-author=\"Gaillard F, Worsley C, Vadera S, et al.

      "question": "A 2-year-old child presents with hepatosplenomegaly, progressive neurological deterioration, and lung involvement. Foam cells are found in the bone marrow, and genetic testing reveals a mutation in the SMPD1 gene. What disease is the child suffering from?",

      },
      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: A) Niemann-Pick Disease Explanation: Niemann-Pick Disease is a severe form that typically presents in early childhood with neurological decline, organ enlargement, and lipid-laden foam cells due to a deficiency in sphingomyelinase caused by mutations in the SMPD1 gene. It is an autosomal recessive disorder of sphingomyelin and cholesterol in the lysosomes. Types: In the classical form (type A) : clinical features begin in early life with feeding difficulties, failure to thrive and developmental delay and later neuroregression. There is a protuberant abdomen with hepatosplenomegaly. Cherry-red spot on fundus examination is seen in about half the cases. Diagnosis is confirmed by measurement of acid sphingomyelinase (ASM) levels. Type B disease : is a milder form with hepatosplenomegaly but no neurological involvement. Type C disease : has variable age at onset, organomegaly, developmental delay, vertical supranuclear gaze palsy, extrapyramidal manifestations and psychiatric features depending upon the age of onset. Gaucher Disease (Option B) : This is the commonest autosomal recessively inherited lysosomal storage disease. It occurs due to the deficiency of the tissue enzyme glucocerebrosidase It is characterized by visceral (hepatosplenomegaly), and bone marrow involvement leading to anemia, thrombocytopenia, leukopenia, bone pains and fractures. There may be associated neurological symptoms like developmental delay, seizures and ocular involvement. Hunter Disease (Option C) : Hunter syndrome is a genetically associated lysosomal storage disorder due to the deficiency of the iduronate 2-sulfatase enzyme (IDS). It is an X-linked recessive disorder and occurs predominantly in males. Iduronate 2-sulfatase (IDS) is responsible for the breakdown of large sugar molecules called glycosaminoglycans. Decreased activity of IDS results in intracellular and extracellular accumulation of heparan sulfate (HS) and dermatan sulfate (DS) in multiple organs of the body. GM1 gangliosidosis (Option D) : It is a rare inherited lysosomal storage disorder caused by deficiency of the enzyme beta-galactosidase resulting in accumulation of GM1 gangliosides in various tissues, particularly in the central nervous system.

      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: C) Treatment with copper-histidinase Explanation: The given clinical presentation is characteristic of Menke’s disease, also known as Menke’s kinky hair syndrome, caused by a deficiency of the copper-transporting ATPase enzyme, leading to impaired copper absorption and transport. Early treatment with copper-histidinase can improve outcomes if started within the first six weeks of life. Menkes Disease (Kinky Hair Disease) Inheritance X-linked recessive and primarily affects males (Option D) Affected Gene ATP7A (codes for copper-transporting P-type ATPase) Gene Location Xq21.1 Pathophysiology Deficiency in copper absorption and transport, copper accumulation in some tissues and deficiency in others Clinical Features Hypothermia Hypotonia Generalised myoclonic seizures Distinctive facies (chubby cheeks, depressed nasal bridge) Kinky, colourless, brittle hair (trichorrhexis nodosa, pili torti) Hypopigmentation Feeding difficulties (failure to thrive) Severe cognitive impairment (optic atrophy) Neuropathologic changes (tortuous degeneration of grey matter, cerebellar changes) Severity Progressive and often fatal by age three if untreated. Treatment Early initiation of copper-histidinase therapy within the first six weeks of life. Deficiency of the enzyme lysyl oxidase (Option A) affects collagen cross-linking and leads to connective tissue disorders like Ehlers-Danlos syndrome. Mutations in the ATP7B gene (Option B) are associated with Wilson’s disease , which involves copper accumulation rather than the copper transport deficiency seen in Menke’s disease.

      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: A) LIPA gene mutation Explanation: The clinical presentation is most likely indicative of Wolman disease, which is caused by a mutation in the LIPA gene . This leads to lysosomal acid lipase deficiency, resulting in the accumulation of cholesteryl esters and triglycerides in various tissues, including the liver. Wolman Disease Inheritance Autosomal recessive Causing Gene LIPA gene (located on chromosome 10q23.2-23.3) Enzyme Deficiency Lysosomal acid lipase (LAL) Function of Enzyme Breakdown of cholesteryl esters and triglycerides in endo-lysosomes Pathophysiology Accumulation of cholesteryl esters and triglycerides in histiocytic foam cells, leading to organ failure. Onset of Symptoms Typically, within the first few weeks of life Clinical Features Failure to thrive Relentless vomiting Abdominal distension Steatorrhea (due to lymphatic obstruction caused by lipid accumulation in the small intestine) Hepatosplenomegaly Adrenal Insufficiency Characterised by subcapsular adrenal calcification due to insufficient free cholesterol for steroidogenesis. Prognosis Death usually occurs within the first year of life Diagnosis Imaging showing adrenal calcification and genetic testing for mutations in the LIPA gene. ATP7A gene mutation (Option B) is associated with Menkes disease, not Wolman disease. ATP7A codes for a copper-transporting enzyme and mutations in this gene lead to copper deficiency and related symptoms. SLC22A4 gene mutation (Option C) is related to various conditions such as rheumatoid arthritis and Crohn’s disease GBA gene mutation (Option D) is linked to Gaucher disease, which is also a lysosomal storage disorder caused by glucocerebrosidase deficiency, leading to the accumulation of glucocerebrosides.",
