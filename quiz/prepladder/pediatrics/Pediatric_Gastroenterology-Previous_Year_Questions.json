      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: C) IHPS Explanation: The clinical scenario is most likely congenital/ idiopathic hypertrophic pyloric stenosis (CHPS), a condition involving hypertrophy of the pyloric muscle, leading to gastric outlet obstruction in male infants, typically between 2 to 6 weeks of age. Risk Factors of Congenital Hypertrophic Pyloric Stenosis Genetic Factors White race of northern European descent Male sex Familial History: Higher risk in offspring of mothers with CHPS (20% for sons, 10% for daughters) Twin Studies: Higher concordance in monozygotic twins suggests a genetic component Blood Groups: Infants with B and O blood groups. Environmental Factors Erythromycin Use: Especially if administered within the first two weeks of life Higher incidence in infants whose mothers used macrolides during pregnancy or breastfeeding, particularly in females. Other Associated Factors Other Congenital Defects Syndromes: Occasionally associated with tracheoesophageal fistula and hypoplasia or agenesis of the inferior labial frenulum. Associated with eosinophilic gastroenteritis, Apert syndrome, Zellweger syndrome, trisomy 18, Smith-Lemli-Opitz syndrome, and Cornelia de Lange syndrome. Clinical Presentation: Symptoms: Projectile, non-bilious vomiting after feeds, starting around 2 to 6 weeks of age. Physical Examination: Visible gastric peristalsis and a palpable “olive-shaped ” mass in the epigastric region. Diagnosis: Ultrasound (USG) is the Investigation of choice for CHPS, characterised by Pyloric muscle thickness of > 3 mm Pyloric length > 14 mm The pyloric channel appears elongated and thickened (10-14 mm) Contrast Studies (Upper GI Series): Less frequently used, demonstrating the classic \"string sign\" with a thin line of contrast through the elongated and narrowed pyloric channel and delayed gastric emptying without duodenal dilation. Characteristic findings of Contrast studies in CHPS Findings Description String Sign A thin line of contrast material passes through the narrowed pyloric channel, indicating severe narrowing due to hypertrophied muscle.

      "question": "What is the most probable diagnosis for a 3-year-old boy who experiences painful bowel movements, has recently started attending school, occasionally complains of fecal incontinence, appears distressed, and shows normal findings?",
      "options": {
        "A": "Functional constipation",
        "B": "Pathologic constipation",
        "C": "Toxic megacolon",
        "D": "Small bowel obstruction"
      },
      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "likely diagnosis in this case. It is a common condition in children and is characterized by infrequent bowel movements, difficulty passing stools, and pain during bowel movements. The boy's recent enrollment in school and complaints of fecal incontinence suggest a functional cause. This condition is usually related to lifestyle factors, such as changes in routine or stress, and does not involve any underlying anatomical or pathological abnormalities. Incorrect Options: Option B: Pathologic constipation Explanation: Pathologic constipation refers to constipation caused by an underlying medical condition. It can be associated with anatomical abnormalities, such as anorectal malformations or Hirschsprung's disease, or systemic diseases, such as thyroid disorders or metabolic disorders. However, since the findings in this case are normal, pathologic constipation is less likely. Option C: Toxic megacolon Explanation: Toxic megacolon is a severe condition characterized by massive dilation of the colon and systemic toxicity. It usually presents with symptoms such as abdominal pain, distension, fever, and signs of systemic inflammation. In this case, since all the findings are reported as normal, toxic megacolon is unlikely. Option D: Small bowel obstruction Explanation: Small bowel obstruction typically presents with symptoms such as abdominal pain, vomiting, distension, and constipation. While small bowel obstruction can cause painful bowel movements, the absence of other signs and symptoms, as well as normal findings, makes it less likely in this case.",

        "B": "Whipple's disease",
        "C": "Tropical sprue",
        "D": "Celiac sprue"
      },
      "correct_answer": "D",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: D) Celiac sprue Explanation: The clinical manifestations indicate Celiac sprue or Gluten-sensitive enteropathy based on the classic presentation of chronic small bowel diarrhea, wheat allergy, villous atrophy, and positive serologic markers (anti-endomysial and TTG IgA antibodies), which is a T-cell mediated autoimmune disorde r triggered by gluten ingestion. Celiac sprue / Celiac disease / Gluten-sensitive enteropathy Clinical manifestations Diarrhoea, growth failure, and anaemia. Temporal association with the introduction of wheat products at weaning. Abdominal distension, vomiting, anorexia, aphthous stomatitis, and bloating. Rickets, osteoporosis, short stature, muscular atrophy, peripheral neuropathy, and irritability might be seen in some cases. Dermatitis herpetiformis can be seen. Diagnosis: ESPGHAN (European Society for Pediatric Gastroenterology, Hepatology & Nutrition) guidelines 2020 suggest that in all suspected cases (symptomatic, asymptomatic, and at-risk group), the first test should be total serum IgA and IgAtTG. Serology: Anti-TTG (Tissue Transglutaminase) Anti EMA (Endomysial antibody) Anti-DGP (Deamidated gliadin peptide) Upper GI endoscopy: The endoscopy may be normal or show the absence of folds or scalloped duodenal folds. Histopathology: Villous atrophy/Flat villi Crypt hyperplasia Intraepithelial lymphocyte infiltration . Treatment: Treatment involves a gluten-free diet (avoid wheat, rye, barley and oats). High-risk groups include type 1 diabetes mellitus, Down syndrome, selective IgA deficiency, autoimmune thyroid disease, Turner syndrome, Williams syndrome, Addison’s disease, autoimmune liver disease and first-degree relatives of patients with celiac disease. A temporal association may be present with the introduction of wheat products at weaning. While cystic fibrosis (Option A) can cause chronic diarrhea, it is typically associated with respiratory symptoms, pancreatic insufficiency, and positive sweat chloride tests. The specific findings of villous atrophy and positive antibodies are not typical of cystic fibrosis. Whipple's disease (Option B) causes malabsorption and diarrhea but is characterized by PAS-positive macrophages in biopsy. It has no association with wheat allergy and lacks the specific antibodies mentioned in the case. The condition is attributed to Tropheryma whipplei infection. Tropical sprue (Option C) can cause villous atrophy but occurs specifically in tropical regions. It has no association with wheat allergy and does not produce the specific antibodies seen in celiac disease. The condition typically responds to antibiotics and folate supplementation.",

        "D": "Bochdalek hernia"
      },
      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: A) Omphalocele Explanation: The characteristic presentation of presence of a translucent membranous sac covering the herniated organs through the umbilical ring, containing typically the liver and intestines indicate an omphalocele , a congenital abdominal wall defect. This condition occurs due to failure of the lateral body folds to migrate centrally during fetal development , resulting in incomplete closure of the anterior abdominal wall. Gastroschisis (Option B) Omphalocele (Option A) Definition A congenital defect where the abdominal wall fails to close, leading to herniation of intestinal loops into the amniotic cavity. M/c in premature/SGA babies A congenital ventral body wall defect where portions of the midgut fail to return to the abdominal cavity after physiological herniation. Location of defect Right paraumbilical Central Sac Absent, bowel is exposed. Present (if not ruptured). Sac is made of amnion, Wharton's jelly and peritoneum Description Free intestinal loops. (Liver is not usually herniated) Firm mass including liver, intestine and/ other organs (like stomach, spleen) Umbilical cord Adjacent to the defect Attached to the sac Associated anomalies Associated anatomic defects are uncommon Associated abnormalities are common and include: Neural tube defect Cardiac abnormalities Chromosomal defect Detection Identified through fetal ultrasound. Elevated alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) levels in maternal serum and amniotic fluid. Elevated alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) concentrations in maternal serum and amniotic fluid, similar to gastroschisis. Complication Affected bowel loops may be damaged due to exposure to corrosive amniotic fluid . Risk of volvulus , where the bowel twists around itself, compromising blood supply. Feeding difficulties Failure to thrive Inguinal hernias Gastroesophageal reflux Occasionally esophagitis Prognosis Favorable High mortality rates Image Persistent vitellointestinal duct (Option C) manifests as a connection between the small intestine and the umbilicus, resulting in umbilical drainage, but does not involve herniation of abdominal organs. This anomaly represents a failure of the embryonic yolk stalk to obliterate completely. Bochdalek hernia (Option D) involves herniation of abdominal contents into the thoracic cavity through a posterolateral diaphragmatic defect. This condition typically presents with respiratory distress and is more common on the left side due to earlier closure of the right pleuroperitoneal canal during development.",

      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: C) Meckel's diverticulum Explanation: The characteristic location of 2 feet proximal to the ileocecal junction and length of 2 inches indicate Meckel's diverticulum , a congenital abnormality caused by incomplete closure of the vitelline duct during the 7th to 8th week of gestation. It can lead to complications like gastrointestinal bleeding, intestinal obstruction, and inflammation.

        "D": "Hyperchloremic hypokalemic acidosis"
      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer B - Hypochloremic hypokalemic alkalosis: In infantile hypertrophic pyloric stenosis (IHPS), there is a thickening of the pyloric muscle, leading to the obstruction of the passage between the stomach and the small intestine. This obstruction results in persistent non-bilious vomiting. The vomiting in IHPS leads to the loss of gastric acid (HCl), causing a decrease in both chloride and hydrogen ions. This leads to hypochloremic metabolic alkalosis. Additionally, the loss of gastric fluid also leads to the loss of potassium (K+), resulting in hypokalemia. Congenital hypertrophic pyloric stenosis (CHPS): This involves hypertrophy of the pyloric muscle , leading to gastric outlet obstruction, mostly in first-born male infants, typically between 3 to 6 weeks of age. Clinical Presentation: Symptoms: Projectile, non-bilious vomiting after feeds Physical Examination: Visible gastric peristalsis from left to right and a palpable “olive-shaped” mass in the epigastric region. Hypochloremic hypokalemic metabolic alkalosis with paradoxical aciduria Diagnosis: Ultrasound (USG) is the investigation of choice for CHPS, characterised by Pyloric muscle thickness of ≥ 4mm Pyloric length ≥ 16 mm The pyloric channel appears elongated and thickened (10-14 mm) Contrast Studies (Upper GI Series): Less frequently used, demonstrating the classic \"string sign\" with a thin line of contrast through the elongated and narrowed pyloric channel and delayed gastric emptying without duodenal dilation.",

      "explanation": "Correct Answer B - Oral rehydration therapy with ORS The best therapy for this patient is oral rehydration therapy with ORS since the child is drinking fluids. Oral Rehydration Therapy (ORT) is based on the physiological principle that glucose-dependent sodium absorption in the gut remains functional during diarrhoea. In this process, glucose and sodium are transported together across the intestinal mucosa, helping to restore sodium and water lost during diarrhoea. The World Health Organization (WHO) Oral Rehydration Solution (ORS) uses a 1:1 molar ratio of glucose and sodium to optimize fluid and electrolyte replacement.

Wilson disease: Also known as hepatolenticular degeneration, is a rare autosomal recessive disorder caused by the abnormal accumulation of copper in the liver, brain, eyes, and other organs. This results in elevated free copper levels, along with increased copper levels in the liver and urine, while serum ceruloplasmin levels are decreased. Pathophysiology: Autosomal recessive (positive family history). Mutation in ATP7B gene (copper transporting P-type adenosine triphosphatase (ATPase), present in chromosome 13 (13q14) .

Extra-Hepatic Biliary Atresia (EHBA) Biliary atresia, not associated with cyst formation. Also known as Non-Cystic Obliterative Cholangiopathy. Characterized by complete obliteration of extrahepatic bile ducts and intrahepatic ducts at the hilum. Symptoms: Typically appear by 2 to 6 weeks of age Jaundice (yellowish coloration of skin and sclera) Abnormally pale stools Dark urine Classification: Perinatal Type (70% cases): No associated anomalies. BASM Syndrome (15% cases): Biliary Atresia Splenic malformations (Polysplenia) Situs inversus Cardiac defects Malrotation of the GIT Other 15% cases: Associated with renal anomalies Associated with choledochal cyst Association with other Anomalies: The most common is polysplenia or asplenia Other associated malformations include absent inferior vena cava, cardiac anomalies, situs inversus, intestinal malrotation, duodenal atresia, anomaly of the portal vein, renal anomalies, and choledochal cyst. Investigations: Liver Function Tests: Increased conjugated bilirubin. Markers of cholestasis: 5' nucleotidase Alkaline phosphatase (ALP) GGT (Gamma-glutamyl transferase): Normal: Up to 40 U/L 4x elevation: Intrahepatic causes 10x elevation: Extrahepatic causes Exception: Low in PFIC type I and II Ultrasound: High-frequency USG (HUS) for neonatal cholestasis. Used as initial investigation Fasting USG is the gold standard when biliary atresia is suspected. Characteristic findings: Triangular cord sign (hyperechoic areas indicating fibrous/atretic bile duct) Non-visualized gallbladder/microgallbladder/gallbladder ghost Radionucleotide Study: HIDA Scan (Hepatobiliary scan with Tc labelled imino-di-acetic acid): Used as a screening test. Decreased tracer excretion due to obstruction Phenobarbitone loading/priming (5 days) to improve tracer uptake Used as a screening test, not specific Best Investigation: Liver biopsy:IOC for confirming diagnosis, shows periductal proliferation. Surgical Management: Algorithm: Exploratory laparotomy Per Operative cholangiogram Temporary procedure: Kasai procedure/hepaticojejunostomy Definitive management: Liver transplantation Kasai Procedure: Temporary procedure Creates communication between liver and jejunum for bile drainage Also known as hepaticojejunostomy Should be performed within 8 weeks after birth Crigler-Najjar syndrome (Option A) is caused by a deficiency in glucuronyl transferase, leading to unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia. It does not show periductal proliferation on liver biopsy. The conjugated hyperbilirubinemia and periductal proliferation seen in this case make Crigler-Najjar syndrome unlikely. Rotor syndrome (Option B) is caused by mutations in the SLCO1B1 and SLCO1B3 genes, which affect the hepatic uptake and biliary excretion of bilirubin, resulting in mild conjugated hyperbilirubinemia. Liver biopsy shows normal histology, not periductal proliferation. The severe cholestasis with clay-colored stools and periductal proliferation, in this case, makes Rotor syndrome unlikely. Dubin-Johnson syndrome (Option C) is caused by a mutation in MRP-2,",

        "D": "Liver biopsy rules out other causes"
      },
      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "Correct answer: A) Kasai procedure should be done within 90 days Explanation: Kasai procedure should ideally be performed within the first 60 days of life, not 90 days . Delaying it beyond 60 days significantly decreases its success rate and heightens the likelihood of needing a liver transplant. Neonatal cholestasis Neonatal cholestasis is an abnormal accumulation of conjugated bilirubin (CB) due to impaired formation or flow of bile. Conjugated bilirubin exceeding 1 mg/dL is strongly suggestive of it. Causes of neonatal cholestasis: Category Condition Surgical (Extrahepatic) Biliary atresia (EHBA) (Most common) (Option C) Choledochal cyst Cholelithiasis Inspissated bile secretion Spontaneous perforation of the bile duct Nonsyndromic paucity of bile ducts Congenital hepatic fibrosis/Caroli disease Neonatal sclerosing cholangitis Medical (Hepatocellular) Idiopathic neonatal hepatitis Prematurity Viral infections (CMV, TORCH, HIV, etc.) Bacterial infections (sepsis, UTI, syphilis, tuberculosis) Hypothyroidism/ Hyperthyroidism/ Hypopituitarism Galactosemia Alagille syndrome Cystic fibrosis α 1-antitrypsin deficiency Indian childhood cirrhosis Tyrosinemia Fructosemia Neonatal hemochromatosis Gaucher disease Wolman disease Extra-Hepatic Biliary Atresia (EHBA) Definition: Biliary atresia not associated with cyst formation. Also known as Non-Cystic Obliterative Cholangiopathy. Characterized by complete obliteration of extrahepatic bile ducts and intrahepatic ducts at the hilum. Symptoms: Typically appear by 2 to 6 weeks of age Jaundice (yellowish coloration of skin and sclera) Abnormally pale stools Dark urine Association with other Anomalies: The most common is polysplenia or asplenia Other associated malformations include absent inferior vena cava, cardiac anomalies, situs inversus, intestinal malrotation, duodenal atresia, anomaly of the portal vein, renal anomalies, and choledochal cyst. Investigations: Liver Function Tests: Increased conjugated bilirubin. Markers of cholestasis: 5' nucleotidase Alkaline phosphatase (ALP) GGT (Gamma-glutamyl transferase): Normal: Up to 40 U/L 4x elevation: Intrahepatic causes 10x elevation: Extrahepatic causes Exception: Low in PFIC type I and II Ultrasound: High-frequency USG (HUS) for neonatal cholestasis. Used as initial investigation Fasting USG is the gold standard when biliary atresia is suspected. Characteristic findings: Triangular cord sign (hyperechoic areas indicating fibrous/atretic bile duct) Non-visualized gallbladder/microgallbladder/gallbladder ghost Radionucleotide Study: HIDA Scan (Option B) is investigation of choice (Hepatobiliary scan with Tc labelled imino-di-acetic acid): Used as a screening test. Decreased tracer excretion due to obstruction Phenobarbitone loading/priming (5 days) to improve tracer uptake Used as a screening test, not specific Best Investigation: Liver biopsy (Option D) : Confirms diagnosis. Surgical Management: Algorithm: Exploratory laparotomy Per Operative cholangiogram Temporary procedure: Kasai procedure/hepaticojejunostomy Definitive management: Liver transplantation Kasai Procedure: Temporary procedure Creates communication between liver and jejunum for bile drainage Also known as hepaticojejunostomy Should be performed within 8 weeks after birth Reference: Nelson Textbook of pediatrics, 22nd edition, Page 2445, 2446, 2447 Bailey and Love’s Short Practice of Surgery, 28th edition, Page 268, 1241 https://www.researchgate.net/figure/Causes-of-neonatal-cholestasis_tbl1_328125414",

In this type, the bilirubin levels can be reduced with the administration of drugs that induce UGT enzyme activity, such as phenobarbital. Incorrect Options: Option A - Rotor syndrome: Rotor syndrome is a benign condition characterized by conjugated hyperbilirubinemia, where bilirubin is conjugated but not efficiently transported from the liver into the bile. Option C - Dubin-Johnson syndrome: Dubin-Johnson syndrome is a benign condition characterized by impaired bilirubin excretion into the bile. It causes a buildup of conjugated bilirubin in the liver, leading to mild conjugated hyperbilirubinemia. Option D - Crigler-Najjar type 1: Crigler-Najjar type 1 is a severe form of the condition characterized by a complete deficiency of UGT enzyme activity. It presents early in life and results in severe unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia. Unlike Crigler-Najjar type 2, Crigler-Najjar type 1 is not responsive to phenobarbital treatment. Management options for Crigler-Najjar type 1 typically involve phototherapy or liver transplantation. Reference: .",
