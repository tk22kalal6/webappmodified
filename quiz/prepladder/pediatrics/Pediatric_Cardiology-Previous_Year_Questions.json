      },
      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: A) Increase in Oxygen Explanation: An increase in oxygen concentration increases the constriction of the smooth muscles of ductus arteriosus, leading to the closure of it. Ductus arteriosus is a structure connecting the aorta and pulmonary artery in fetal circulation ,which closes after delivery of the fetus. Changes in Fetal Circulation Following Birth: Parameter/Structure Change Cause Pulmonary Vascular Resistance (PVR) Decreases (Option C) Mechanical expansion of the lungs and increased arterial PO2 lead to a rapid decrease in PVR. Systemic Vascular Resistance (SVR) Increases The removal of the low-resistance placental circulation results in an increase in SVR. Ductus Arteriosus Shunt Reverses and eventually closes. As PVR becomes lower than SVR , the shunt through the ductus arteriosus reverses from right-to-left to left-to-right. High arterial PO2 leads to the constriction and eventual closure of the ductus arteriosus, which later becomes the ligamentum arteriosum. Foramen Ovale Closes Increased pulmonary blood flow to the left atrium raises left atrial volume and pressure, leading to the functional closure of the foramen ovale. Ductus Venosus Closes The removal of the placenta from circulation results in the closure of the ductus venosus. Left ventricular Wall Thickness and Mass Increases The left ventricle's wall thickness and mass increase as it adapts to the high-resistance systemic circulation. Right ventricular Wall Thickness and Mass Decreases The right ventricle's wall thickness and mass decrease as it adapts to the low-resistance pulmonary circulation. Left Ventricular Output Increases The left ventricle now must deliver the entire systemic cardiac output, which is almost a 200% increase compared to fetal conditions. Right Ventricular Output Increases Opening of pulmonary vasculature results in increased right ventricular output. Time frame of closure of shunts following birth: Shunt Functional Closure Anatomical closure Remnant Ductus Arteriosus 10-15 hrs after birth 2 -3 weeks after birth Ligamentum arteriosum Foramen ovale 3rd month 1 year after birth Fossa ovalis Ductus venosus Immediately after birth 3-7 days after birth Ligamentum venosum. CO2 and catecholamines have no role in ductal closure (Option B, D) . Reference: Nelson Textbook of pediatrics, 21st edition, page 2345",

      "correct_answer": "D",
      "explanation": "cerebral ventricles, which are fluid-filled spaces within the brain. It is a common finding in newborns and can be caused by various underlying conditions. Aqueductal stenosis is the most common cause of ventriculomegaly in newborns. Aqueductal stenosis is a condition characterized by a narrowing or obstruction of the cerebral aqueduct, a narrow passage that connects the third and fourth ventricles in the brain. When this passage is narrowed or blocked, the flow of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) is obstructed, leading to the accumulation of fluid in the ventricles and resulting in ventriculomegaly. Incorrect Choices Option A: Arnold-Chiari malformation- Arnold-Chiari malformation refers to a group of structural defects in the brain and spinal cord. It involves a downward displacement of the cerebellar tonsils through the opening at the base of the skull. While it can be associated with hydrocephalus, it is not the most common cause of ventriculomegaly in newborns. Option B: Dandy-Walker syndrome- Dandy-Walker syndrome is a congenital brain malformation characterized by the enlargement of the fourth ventricle and the presence of a cystic structure in the posterior fossa. While it can cause hydrocephalus, it is not the most common cause of ventriculomegaly in newborns. Option C: Arachnoid Villi malformation- Arachnoid villi are structures that help drain cerebrospinal fluid from the brain into the bloodstream. Malformation or dysfunction of these structures can lead to impaired CSF drainage and hydrocephalus. However, it is not the most common cause of ventriculomegaly in newborns.",

        "C": "Only 1,2,4 is correct",
        "D": "All are correct"
      },
      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer A- Only 1,2,3 is correct Explanation: Congenital heart diseases that can present with split-second heart sounds include: Atrial Septal Defect (ASD): An ASD is a hole in the wall (septum) that separates the two upper chambers of the heart (atria). It can lead to increased blood flow from the left atrium to the right atrium, resulting in more evident splitting of the second heart sound (S2) during auscultation. Ventricular Septal Defect (VSD): A VSD is a hole in the septum between the two lower chambers of the heart (ventricles). Like ASD, it can cause increased blood flow from the left ventricle to the right ventricle, leading to accentuated splitting of S2. Patent Ductus Arteriosus (PDA): PDA is a condition where a blood vessel called the ductus arteriosus, which connects the pulmonary artery to the aorta during fetal development, remains open after birth. This can result in abnormal blood flow and increased flow across the pulmonary valve, leading to a more pronounced splitting of S2. The congenital heart disease that does not typically present with split-second heart sounds is: Tetralogy of Fallot (TOF) Components of Tetralogy of Fallot: Pulmonary Stenosis : Narrowing of the pathway from the right ventricle to the pulmonary artery, possibly affecting the infundibulum, valve, or main pulmonary artery. Ventricular Septal Defect (VSD) : A large hole between the right and left ventricles, usually misaligned, allowing abnormal blood flow. Overriding Aorta : The aorta is positioned over the septum, receiving blood from both ventricles. Right Ventricular Hypertrophy : Thickening of the right ventricle wall due to the extra effort required to pump blood. Examination findings in TOF Cardiac Auscultation Heart Sounds : Typically normal first heart sound with a single second heart sound (pulmonic component usually inaudible) Murmur : Harsh systolic ejection murmur, crescendo-decrescendo in quality Best heard at the left mid to upper sternal border Radiates posteriorly The severity of the murmur correlates with the degree of right ventricular outflow tract obstruction May occasionally have a regurgitant quality Early systolic click : Sometimes heard along the left sternal border (attributed to flow through a dilated ascending aorta) Continuous murmur : Present over the back and axillary regions in patients with pulmonary atresia and aortopulmonary collaterals Palpation Prominent ventricular impulse Systolic thrill may be palpable along the left sternal border Reference: Nelson textbook of pediatrics 21st Edition Page 2395-2397",

      "question": "Which of the following features can be alleviated by performing surgical correction of VSD in an infant?",

        "B": "Failure to thrive",
        "C": "Arrhythmia",
        "D": "Heart block"
      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: B) Failure to Thrive Explanation: Infants with a large VSD can develop heart failure that leads to poor weight gain and inadequate growth, called failure to thrive . Surgical correction of VSD aims to repair the structural defect, which reduces strain, improves cardiac function, and prevents pulmonary vascular disease. It can enhance the infant's ability to feed, leading to proper weight gain and relieving the feature of failure to thrive . Indications of surgery in VSD: Large defects in patients of any age who have persistent symptoms or fail to thrive. Moderate to large defects in infants aged 6 to 12 months with pulmonary hypertension, even if symptoms are managed with medication. Children older than 24 months with a Qp:Qs ratio of >2:1. Supracristal VSDs of any size due to an elevated risk of aortic valve regurgitation. Contraindications for VSD closure: Severe pulmonary vascular disease that does not respond to pulmonary vasodilator therapy. Respiratory alkalosis (Option A) is not the main acid-base disturbance in VSD. Large VSDs primarily cause metabolic acidosis (due to CHF), not persistent respiratory alkalosis. If respiratory alkalosis occurs, it is secondary to mild tachypnea and not the primary issue requiring surgical correction. Surgery does not reliably prevent or treat arrhythmia (Option C) and may sometimes increase the risk of it. Surgical repair does not alleviate heart block (Option D); rather, it is a potential complication of VSD closure and may occur perioperatively.

      "options": {
        "A": "Tetralogy of Fallot",
        "B": "Total anomalous pulmonary venous circulation",
        "C": "Tricuspid atresia",
        "D": "Transposition of great arteries"
      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer B - Total anomalous pulmonary venous circulation The congenital heart disease that exhibits equivalent saturation levels across all heart chambers is total anomalous pulmonary venous circulation . This is because, in this condition, the systemic and pulmonary venous blood mixes in the heart (right atrium) and then is distributed into all chambers of the heart leading to an equivalent saturation across all heart chambers. Total Anomalous Pulmonary Venous Connection: Pulmonary veins drain into the right atrium directly or indirectly via an abnormal venous connection. Sites of venous connection: Supracardiac- superior vena cava Cardiac-coronary sinus, right atrium Infracardiac Mixed Clinical presentation: Cyanosis and congestive cardiac failure Diagnosis: Chest X-ray: Snowman or figure-8 configuration. Cardiomegaly and increased pulmonary vascularity are evident ECG: Right axis deviation and right ventricular hypertrophy. Others: Echocardiography, CT, MRI. Treatment: Supplemental oxygen Ionotropic support Mechanical ventilation if necessary Balloon Atrial Septostomy: This may be required in rare cases with a restricted patent foramen ovale . Cardiac catheterization : Stents may be placed to stabilize the neonate in cases of obstructive TAPVC . In Tetralogy of Fallot (Option A) , there is a ventricular septal defect, overriding aorta, pulmonary stenosis and right ventricular hypertrophy. Thus, the failure in the closure of the foramen ovale, right to left results in mixed blood in the left heart and unoxygenated blood in the right heart. Hence all four chambers don't have the same oxygen concentration. Tricuspid atresia (Option C) is a congenital condition characterised by the absence of the tricuspid valve, leading to a hypoplastic (underdeveloped) right ventricle. Here, blood flows through an atrial septal defect (ASD) into the left atrium (LA) and then to the left ventricle (LV). The saturation cannot be equal across all chambers since the left ventricle is hypoplastic. In transposition of great arteries (Option D) , the right ventricle ends at the right aorta, which carries deoxygenated blood from the right ventricle to the tissue while the left ventricle drains into the pulmonary artery. Hence two separate systems are created. Deoxygenated blood is circulated in systemic circulation and oxygenated in the pulmonary circulation.",

      },
      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer C - Atrial septal defect The systolic murmur and a widely split-second heart sound in an otherwise normal child indicate an atrial septal defect. Atrial septal defect Pathophysiology: Feature Description Left-to-Right Shunting Oxygenated blood flows from the left to right atrium; the degree of shunting varies with defect size and vascular resistance. Right Heart Volume Overload Increased blood flow causes enlargement of the right atrium and ventricle, and dilation of the pulmonary artery. Pulmonary Vascular Resistance May increase with time, after remaining low during childhood, and lead to reversal of shunt and cyanosis. Clinical Manifestations: Symptoms Description Asymptomatic Many children are asymptomatic. Failure to Thrive Poor growth and weight gain. Exercise Intolerance Difficulty with physical activity. Physical Examination Findings: Finding Description Widely Split and Fixed S2 The second heart sound is split and fixed due to increased right ventricular diastolic volume. Systolic Ejection Murmur Soft murmur at the left upper sternal border, caused by increased flow across the right ventricular outflow tract. Mid-Diastolic Murmur Rumbling murmur at the lower left sternal border due to increased flow across the tricuspid valve. Children with total anomalous pulmonary venous connection (Option A) are not asymptomatic and often present with cyanosis and congestive cardiac failure with equal saturation levels across all four heart chambers. Examination findings of fixed split S2, systolic ejection murmur, and cyanosis are seen. Hence, it is not the given scenario. In ventricular septal defects (Option B), there are left-to-right shunts that are symptomatic depending on the size of the defect and may vary from asymptomatic with normal pulmonary artery pressure and a loud, harsh or blowing holosystolic murmur to pulmonary hypertension and symptoms of congestive cardiac failure. Pulmonary stenosis (Option D) is the narrowing of the pathway from the right ventricle to the pulmonary artery, possibly affecting the infundibulum, valve, or main pulmonary artery. It is a component of the Tetralogy of Fallot and often presents with severe cyanosis from birth. The clinical findings include an ejection click heard after S1 (closer to S1 as the severity increases) and a split S2 in moderate to severe cses.

      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer C - Down’s syndrome The most common association with Tetralogy of Fallot is for Down’s syndrome. Tetralogy of Fallot is also associated with Alagille syndrome and DiGeorge syndrome. Down's syndrome , caused by trisomy 21, is associated with multiple systemic manifestations due to the presence of an extra copy of chromosome 21. This is due to meiotic nondisjunction in either maternal or paternal gamete. Occurs at a frequency of 1:800 to 1:1000 newborns. The overexpression of genes located on chromosome 21 contributes to the clinical features. Comorbidities associated with Down syndrome: Congenital Heart Disease : 40% of children have congenital heart defects, primarily endocardial cushion defects (40-60% of cases) They are: AVSD, Ventricular Septal Defect, Atrial Septal Defect, Patent Ductus Arteriosus, and Tetralogy Of Fallot . Early cardiac evaluation is crucial. Gastrointestinal Malformations : 12% have atresias, especially duodenal atresia. There is an increased risk of annular pancreas and Hirschsprung disease. Ophthalmic Problems : Increased risk of cataracts, nystagmus, strabismus, and visual acuity issues. Regular eye evaluations are advised from infancy onward. Hearing Defects : 40-60% experience conductive hearing loss, often due to serous otitis media in the first year. Routine hearing assessments are recommended before 6 months of age and annually. Thyroid Dysfunction : Hypothyroidism occurs in 13-54% of patients. Atlanto-occipital Subluxation : Incidence ranges from 10-30%. A lateral neck radiograph is recommended. Physical Growth : Linear growth is typically slower, and children may become obese with age. Muscle tone often improves, but regular monitoring of height and weight is necessary. Malignancies : Increased risk of lymphoproliferative disorders, such as acute lymphoblastic leukaemia , acute myeloid leukaemia, myelodysplasia, and transient lymphoproliferative syndrome. Early-Onset Alzheimer's Disease: The APP gene, located on chromosome 21, plays a significant role in amyloid plaque formation, a hallmark of Alzheimer's disease. Klinefelter syndrome (Option A) involves mitral valve prolapse, ASD, partial atrioventricular canal defect, and patent ductus arteriosus. Edwards syndrome (Option B) (trisomy 18) involves ventricular septal defect (VSD), patent ductus arteriosus (PDA), and polyvalvular dysplasia. In Turner’s syndrome (Option D), the cardiac abnormalities seen are coarctation of the Aorta and bicuspid aortic valve. TOF is not a part of this condition.

      "explanation": "Correct Answer A - Ebstein anomaly Lithium intake by the pregnant mother can cause Ebstein anomaly in the fetus. Ebstein's Anomaly: Associated with lithium exposure during pregnancy. Pathophysiology: Downward displacement/prolapse of the tricuspid valve. Part of the right ventricular volume becomes part of the right atrium (atrialization of the right ventricle). Consequences: Tricuspid Regurgitation: Prolapsed valve → Blood from the right ventricle regurgitates into the right atrium. RVOT (Right Ventricular Outflow Tract) Obstruction: Prolapsed valve partly occludes blood flow towards the pulmonary artery → Cyanosis. Features: Cyanosis at birth or during the neonatal period. Pansystolic murmur: Due to tricuspid regurgitation. Quadruple Rhythm: Irregular blood flow in the right heart, RVOT obstruction, and tricuspid regurgitation → Multiple added sounds and ejection clicks. X-Ray Findings: Right atrial enlargement due to regurgitation from the right ventricle and atrialization of the right ventricle. RA forms the right heart border, which displaces laterally and appears on X-ray as a box-shaped heart.

      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: B) COA Explanation: The clinical manifestations indicate Coarctation of Aorta (COA) , a congenital narrowing of the aorta typically occurring just distal to the left subclavian artery at the insertion of the ductus arteriosus. Coarctation of the Aorta is characterized by weak femoral pulses (lower limb pulses) and strong upper limb pulses. There is a disparity in pulsation and BP in the arms and legs. This is referred to as Radio-femoral delay. Coarctation of the Aorta Definition Constrictions of the aorta of varying degrees at any point from the transverse arch to the iliac bifurcation. Clinical presentation: Differential cyanosis Heart failure in severe cases Weakness or pain/claudication (or both) in the legs after exercise Radio-femoral delay: Disparity in pulsation and BP in the arms and legs Systolic or continuous murmurs are heard over the left and right sides of the chest laterally and posteriorly due to collateral blood flow. Investigation: Chest x-ray: The arrows indicate rib notching and the yellow line shows the site of coarctation Enlarged left subclavian artery produces a prominent shadow in the left superior mediastinum. Notching of the inferior border of the ribs from pressure erosion by enlarged collateral vessels (Common in late childhood after 1st decade of life) Descending aorta has an area of post-stenotic dilation. ECG, echocardiography, colour Doppler, CT, and MRI. Treatment: Infusion of prostaglandin E1 to reopen the ductus and reestablish adequate lower-extremity blood flow. Surgical repair Incorrect Options: Transposition of Great Arteries (TGA) (Option A) is a congenital heart defect where the aorta arises from the right ventricle, and the pulmonary artery arises from the left ventricle. It presents with early cyanosis and circulatory compromise but does not typically cause differential pulses between the upper and lower extremities. Tetralogy of Fallot (TOF) (Option C): While TOF causes cyanosis and may have associated heart failure, it does not cause differential pulses between the upper and lower extremities. TOF is characterized by ventricular septal defect, overriding aorta, pulmonary stenosis and right ventricular hypertrophy. Ebstein anomaly (Option D): This condition involves abnormal positioning of the tricuspid valve and right heart dysfunction but does not cause differential pulses.",

Incorrect Options: Option A - Cardioversion: This is typically reserved for patients with PSVT who are hemodynamically unstable or in cases where pharmacologic treatment is ineffective. Given that the child has stable vitals, cardioversion is not the first-line treatment. Option B - Adenosine 0.2 mg/kg: This is the dose used if the initial dose of adenosine (0.1 mg/kg) fails to convert the PSVT. It is not the starting dose, so it is not the appropriate initial treatment. Option D - IV Adrenaline: Adrenaline is not indicated for treating PSVT. It is used in resuscitation protocols, particularly in cases of cardiac arrest or anaphylaxis, not for stable PSVT.",

      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: B) Membranous defect Explanation The most common defect in ventricular septal defect (VSD) is membranous defect. Pathophysiology of VSD: The interventricular septum has two parts: membranous and muscular . VSD occurs due to incomplete development or fusion of septal components during embryonic cardiac formation. A unified classification system is used to describe VSDs. Types of VSD: Infundibular (Outlet) VSD : Location: Below semilunar valves (aortic and pulmonary), within the outlet septum of the right ventricle. Perimembranous VSD: Location: Membranous septum, below crista supraventricularis. Characteristics: Most common (80% of cases), may involve muscular septum, potential for spontaneous closure. Inlet (Atrioventricular Canal) VSD: Location: Below the inlet valves (tricuspid and mitral), in the inlet portion of the right ventricle septum. Characteristics: Represents 8% of all VSDs, more common in patients with Trisomy 21. Muscular (Trabecular) VSD: Location: Muscular septum (apical, central, outlet regions). Characteristics: Can present as multiple defects (\"Swiss cheese\"), more common in infants, the tendency to close spontaneously with age. Gerbode Defects: A distinct defect with a direct connection between the left ventricle and right atrium. Type 1: True Gerbode, congenital deficiency in the membranous septum. Type 2: Subvalvular type, ventriculo-atrial shunting due to central VSD and tricuspid valve defect. Type 3: Combination of Type 1 and Type 2 characteristics.
