      "explanation": "Correct Answer: D) All of the above Explanation: If HR <100/min or apnoea or gasping is present, then the following steps are followed: Start PPV by self-inflating the Bag and Mask (Option A) Check SpO2 and monitor ECG (Option B) Reassess after 30 seconds, if the HR is not less than 100/min then the baby gets post-resuscitation care (Option C) Baby with labored breathing and persistent cyanosis, improved by CPAP, also needs post-resuscitation care. Post resuscitation care: Baby is taken to nursery/NICU, continued monitoring the condition of baby, start IV fluids, oxygen if required, monitor the baby and treat them accordingly i.e by maintaining proper temperature, the glucose of baby.

      "correct_answer": "D",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: D) All are correct Explanation: In antenatal care, the medical officer plays a comprehensive role in ensuring both maternal and fetal wellbeing. Each of the listed options represents a valid and essential responsibility during the antenatal period: Antenatal counseling for the mother (Option A): Counselling on nutrition, rest, warning signs, birth preparedness, and family planning is a core component of ANC . Helps in early identification of risk factors and improves compliance with care. Team briefing and individual responsibility allocation (Option B): Although more emphasized in intrapartum care or emergencies , team readiness and role clarity is important throughout pregnancy , especially in high-risk cases. Promotes coordinated care and avoids delay in emergencies. Equipment check and preparation (Option C): Ensures availability of functional equipment for monitoring (BP apparatus, fetal Doppler, weighing scale, etc.) and emergency preparedness . Critical for centres offering delivery services or managing complications. III Proper history taking (e.g., prior preterm delivery or abortions) (Option D): A comprehensive history helps in risk stratification , planning investigations, and interventions. Past obstetric history is vital for predicting complications in the current pregnancy. Conclusion: Each of these tasks falls under the preventive, promotive, or preparatory functions of antenatal care. Reference: Ghai Essential Pediatrics, 8th Edition, Pages 125-132",

      "explanation": "Correct Answer: C) Intubation never done Explanation: In case HR is less than 100/min despite PPV, you may intubate the baby or do endotracheal intubation. Ensure if the positive pressure ventilation is given properly or not by checking if the chest movement is happening with each breath given or not. (Option A) Ventilation corrective steps are used in Neonatal resuscitation to ensure the baby is getting adequate oxygen, clear airway obstruction, correct inadequate breathing efforts, prevent hypoxia, and support circulatory functions. (Option B) Ventilation corrective steps includes: The mask should cover the mouth and nose should fit well and provide an effective seal Ensure the Mask is of appropriate size The head of the baby should be slightly extended and the mouth of the baby should be kept slightly open When HR becomes less than 100/min if needed endotracheal intubation is done (Option D) Reference: Ghai Essential Pediatrics, 8th Edition, Pages 125-132",

The recommended pressure of suction is 80 mmHg It should never exceed >100 mmHg Recommended temperature of delivery room:~25 degrees Celsius In the delivery room, the baby should be kept at a warmer temperature of much higher than 25 degrees Celsius.

      "explanation": "Correct Answer: D) The rate of PPV should be 30-40/min Explanation: To match the normal physiological breathing rate of newborns and their requirements the rate of PPV is 40-60/min. The reservoir bag and oxygen tubing may or may not be attached to the self-inflating bag. When it is squeezed and released it will inflate on its own, there is no need for an extra supply of oxygen or gas to inflate it. (Option A) The function of the reservoir is to increase FiO2 delivered to the baby. Each breath delivers oxygen to the baby, with a portion stored in the reservoir.

      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: B) End-tidal carbon dioxide (ETCO2) detection Explanation: End-tidal carbon dioxide (ETCO2) detection is the most reliable method for confirming the proper placement of an endotracheal tube immediately after intubation. Methods to confirm the correct placement of the ET tube: On Inspection: Visible B/L chest rise on each breath On Auscultation: B/L equal breath sounds Absence of breath sounds in epigastrium Visible condensation in endotracheal tube Large exhaled tidal volumes Improvement in vital parameters like spo2, color of baby, peripheral perfusion Misting in the endotracheal tube with each breath due to excess water vapor and expired air Confirmatory method: EtCO2 (End-tidal co2) also known as capnography (Surest confirmatory) The tip of ETT should be at the level of the lower border of T2 Different sizes of the Endotracheal tube: Age Internal diameter(mm) Length(cm) Full term infant 3.5 12 Child 4+ (Age/4) 12+(Age/2){orotracheal} 14+(Age/2){nasotracheal} Adult female 7.0 - 7.5 20-22 Adult male 7.5 - 9 22-24 The most preferred type of cuff in ET is a high-volume, low-pressure The advantage of a high-volume, low-pressure cuff is the lesser incidence of tracheal mucosal damage The cuff pressure should not exceed 25 cm of H20 since excess cuff pressure can lead to tracheal mucosal injury and recurrent laryngeal nerve palsy Auscultation of breath sounds (Option A): While auscultation can indicate whether breath sounds are present in both lungs, it is not entirely reliable for confirming placement. It may not detect misplacement into the esophagus or only one lung. Visualization of the tube passing through the vocal cords (Option C): While visualizing the tube entering the trachea is a strong indicator of correct placement, it may not be practical in all situations, especially under emergency conditions or if the view is obstructed. Chest X-ray (Option D): While a chest X-ray can confirm tube placement, it is not an immediate method and takes time. In emergency situations, relying on a chest X-ray is impractical.",

      "explanation": "Correct Answer: D) It improves the newborn iron stores and reduces the risk of anemia Explanation: Umbilical cord clamping must be delayed for 1 to 2 minutes to allow the transfer of the additional amount of blood from the placenta to the infant. Components of delayed cord clamping include: Wait for at least 60 seconds before clamping the cord It is recommended for all stable-term as well as preterm neonates Advantages: 1) lesser chances of anemia 2) lesser need for blood transfusion 3) lesser risk of shock or hypotension 4) lesser risk of necrotizing enterocolitis 5) lesser risk of intra-ventricular hemorrhage in preterm infants Disadvantages: slightly increased risk of neonatal jaundice Delayed cord clamping provides several benefits for the newborn, but it does not play a direct role in reducing the risk of PPH in the mother. (Option A) Delayed cord clamping has no benefits in reducing the likelihood of neonatal jaundice. It may cause a slightly increased risk of neonatal jaundice. (Option B) Delayed cord clamping is not related to preventing the need for neonatal resuscitation. In cases requiring resuscitation early cord clamping is done.
