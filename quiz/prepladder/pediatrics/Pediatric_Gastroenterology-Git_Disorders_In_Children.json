      "correct_answer": "D",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: D) All of the above Explanation: The given clinical scenario involves persistent diarrhoea (lasting for >2 weeks), which is managed by dietary modifications, correction of dehydration, and treatment of the cause. Persistent diarrhoea is an episode of diarrhoea of presumed infectious aetiology that starts acutely but lasts for more than 14 days . It is more common in malnourished children, whose impaired nutritional status hinders gut repair, worsening nutrient absorption and perpetuating a vicious cycle. Infections like E. coli or infections of any other site, such as the urinary tract or respiratory tract, can lead to this condition. The use of antibiotics in acute diarrhoea can disrupt normal gut flora, leading to bacterial or fungal overgrowth and resulting in persistent diarrhoea and malabsorption. Management: Correction of dehydration, electrolytes and hypoglycemia. Empirical antibiotic therapy (Option C) and antiparasitic agents as per the cause. Nutritional rehabilitation (Option A) Elimination diet as (Option B) Diet A (Reduced lactose diet) Diet B (Lactose-free diet with reduced starch) Diet C (Monosaccharide-based diet) Some other supplements like Zinc and Vitamin A can also be given Reference: Nelson Textbook of Pediatrics, 21st edition, Page 2038, 2039, 2040.

      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: C) Rectal suction biopsy Explanation: Rectal suction biopsy is the Gold Standard Test for confirming Hirschsprung disease. Procedure: A biopsy must be taken 2 cm above the dentate line and must include adequate submucosa. Staining: Acetylcholinesterase: Identifies hypertrophied nerve bundles and the absence of ganglion cells. Calretinin: Used as an alternative when acetylcholinesterase staining is inadequate. Contrast enema (Option A): Useful for showing transition zones between dilated and narrow segments but not as reliable as rectal biopsy. Sensitivity ~70%, specificity 50-80%. Anorectal manometry (Option B): Evaluates rectoanal inhibitory reflex (RAIR) with high sensitivity and specificity (>90%), but not considered the definitive test for young infants. Colonoscopy (Option D) can visualise the bowel but does not provide the definitive histological information needed to confirm Hirschsprung disease.

        "D": "Excessive production of acetylcholine in the enteric nervous system"
      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: B) Lack of ganglionic cells in the submucosal and myenteric plexuses Explanation: The given clinical scenario suggests Hirschsprung disease , characterised by the lack of ganglionic cells in the submucosal (Meissner’s) and myenteric (Auerbach’s) , leading to absent peristalsis and functional obstruction in the affected bowel segment. Hirschsprung Disease: It is the most common congenital motility disorder and is characterised by the absence of ganglionic cells in the distal intestine. Pathophysiology: The absence of ganglionic cells (aganglionosis) in the distal segment of the intestine leads to tonic contraction and functional obstruction of the affected bowel segment. Classification: Short Segment (75%) : Limited to the segment distal to the splenic flexure. Long Segment (20%): Extends proximal to the splenic flexure. Total Colonic Aganglionosis (5%) : The entire colon is affected. Clinical Presentation Neonates: Delayed passage of meconium, constipation, obstruction Later presentation: Chronic constipation, failure to thrive, enterocolitis Diagnosis: X-ray: Reveals bowel distension and air-fluid levels. Barium enema: Narrow aganglionic segment, transition zone, proximal dilation Anorectal manometry: Absence of rectoanal inhibitory reflex Rectal biopsy (gold standard): Absence of ganglionic cells Management: Primarily Surgical: Resection of the aganglionic bowel and pull-through of normal bowel. Medical Management: Stabilization and treatment of enterocolitis prior to surgery. Surgical Approach: Trend toward less invasive techniques, including laparoscopic and single-stage procedures. Absence of smooth muscle in the bowel wall (Option A): Hirschsprung disease does not involve a lack of smooth muscle; rather, it affects the neural elements within the bowel wall. Hypertrophy of the circular muscle layer in the entire colon (Option C): While hypertrophy may occur in the affected segment, the primary pathology is the absence of ganglionic cells, not generalised hypertrophy of muscle layers. Excessive production of acetylcholine in the enteric nervous system (Option D): The disorder is not due to excessive acetylcholine but to the absence of ganglionic cells, which impairs normal neurotransmission and bowel motility.",

      "question": "A 3-year-old child was brought to the emergency department as she has been unusually irritable and has had abdominal pain and vomiting over the past 24 hours. On examination, the sausage-shaped mass was palpable over the abdomen. The barium enema radiograph revealed a coiled spring appearance. What is the most likely diagnosis?",

        "D": "Intussusception"
      },
      "correct_answer": "D",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: D) Intussusception. Explanation: The clinical features of a sausage-shaped abdominal mass, red currant jelly stools, abdominal pain, and the ‘coiled spring sign’ on barium enema studies suggest intussusception. Intussusception: It refers to the telescoping of a proximal segment of the intestine (intussusceptum) into a distal segment (intussuscipiens). Most common cause of intestinal obstruction in 5 months to 6 years of age. It may be ileocolic (most common), colocolic or ileoileal. Clinical features: The classic triad of abdominal pain, red currant jelly stools (blood and mucus) and palpable mass are observed. Barium enema shows a ‘ Coiled Spring Sign or Claw Sign’.. Management: Spontaneous resolution occurs in a few patients. Hydrostatic reduction under Fluoroscopic or USG guidance. Surgical reduction may be required if the child has refractory shock, suspected intestinal perforation or necrosis, or in case of multiple recurrences or peritonitis. Hirschsprung disease (Option A), is characterized by absence of ganglion cells in the distal intestine , can present as delayed passing of meconium or constipation. Barium enema shows the dilated proximal segment and the transition zone. Duodenal atresia (Option B) is characterised by bilious vomiting without abdominal distention and shows the double bubble sign on the x-ray. Sigmoid volvulus (Option C) is caused by twisting of the small intestine, leading to symptoms like abdominal pain, bloating, and inability to pass gas and shows a ‘ coffee bean sign’ on the x-ray as shown, Reference: Nelson Textbook of Pediatrics, 21st edition, Page 1965, 1966.

According to the 2020 ESPGHAN guidelines, after confirming elevated anti-tTG IgA, a small intestinal biopsy is the next step for a definitive diagnosis. If a person is asymptomatic or at risk of developing celiac disease, then HLA-DQ2 and HLA-DQ8 genotyping is done. Measure total serum IgG levels (Option A): Not needed; total serum IgA levels are checked to ensure accurate anti-tTG IgA results. Test for anti-endomysial antibodies (EMA) (Option D) are done when anti-ttG IgA levels are elevated to 10 or more times the upper limit of normal.",

      },
      "correct_answer": "D",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: D) Treatment includes a high-fiber wheat diet. Explanation: The given scenario and biopsy findings are consistent with Celiac disease or Gluten-sensitive enteropathy, a T-cell mediated autoimmune disorder associated with HLADQ2 & HLADQ8 and Down’s syndrome. Treatment involves a gluten-free diet ( avoid wheat, rye, barley and oats). High-risk groups include type 1 diabetes mellitus, Down syndrome (Option C) , selective IgA deficiency, autoimmune thyroid disease, Turner syndrome, Williams syndrome, Addison’s disease, autoimmune liver disease and first-degree relatives of patients with celiac disease. A temporal association may be present with the introduction of wheat products at weaning. Clinical manifestations: Diarrhoea, growth failure, and anaemia. Temporal association with the introduction of wheat products at weaning. Abdominal distension, vomiting, anorexia, aphthous stomatitis, and bloating. Rickets, osteoporosis, short stature, muscular atrophy, peripheral neuropathy, and irritability might be seen in some cases. Dermatitis herpetiformis can be seen. Diagnosis: ESPGHAN (European Society for Pediatric Gastroenterology, Hepatology & Nutrition) guidelines 2020 suggest that in all suspected cases (symptomatic, asymptomatic, and at-risk group), the first test should be total serum IgA and IgAtTG.

        "D": "Diverticulosis"
      },
      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: C) Lactose intolerance Explanation: The given scenario of explosive stools (mixed with gas and passed with noise) after consuming milk suggests Lactose Intolerance, a condition in which the baby cannot digest milk and its products. Pathogenesis Impaired digestion of lactose due to insufficient lactase enzyme leads to gut intolerance. Types Congenital or Primary: It is due to a mutation of the lactose gene. Acquired or Secondary (most common): Secondary to some infection , persistent diarrhoea, drugs, radiation, etc. Clinical features Diarrhea, abdominal pain and vomiting The characteristic feature is the passing of explosive stools (i.e., stools mixed with gas and passed with noise), especially after consuming milk or its products. Perianal excoriation because of acidic stools. Diagnosis Resolution of symptoms by avoiding milk products. Stool pH <6.5 Management Avoid milk and its products (lactose-free diet) Vitamin A and zinc supplements. Irritable bowel syndrome (Option A) is characterised by abdominal pain occurring at least 4 days per month for 2 months, with pain related to defecation, and accompanied by changes in stool frequency and consistency. Small intestinal bacterial overgrowth (Option B) (SIBO) is a condition in which large intestinal bacteria overgrow in the small intestine, causing symptoms like bloating, abdominal pain, and diarrhoea, independent of milk consumption. Diverticulosis (Option D) is the outpouching of the walls of the intestine (colon or small intestine), which can cause bloating, diarrhoea, abdominal pain, or constipation and is unrelated to milk consumption.

        "D": "Antireflux surgery (fundoplication)."
      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: B) Positioning therapy and thickened feedings. Explanation: The infant’s symptoms suggest gastroesophageal reflux disease GERD, commonly seen in infants due to the immaturity of the lower esophageal sphincter . Positioning therapy and thickened feedings are the preferred initial management for mild to moderate GERD symptoms in infants. Positioning therapy involves keeping the infant upright during and after feedings to reduce reflux. Thickened feedings , often with rice cereal, reduce regurgitation by preventing stomach contents from flowing back into the esophagus. Management of GERD Conservative Therapy Pharmacotherapy Surgery Positioning Therapy Keep the infant upright during and after feedings. Avoid supine and side sleeping positions. Thickened Feedings Add rice cereal or a thickening agent to formula or breast milk. Small and frequent meals Dietary Modifications Evaluate maternal diet in breastfeeding infants for allergens. Monitoring and Reassessment Regularly monitor growth and development. Proton Pump Inhibitors (PPIs) Used for severe symptoms or when esophagitis is suspected. Examples : Omeprazole, Lansoprazole. H2-Receptor Antagonists Alternative to PPIs if initial management is insufficient. Surgical Intervention Reserved for severe cases not responsive to other treatments. Nissen fundoplication is the most common procedure. Start proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) immediately (Option A): PPIs are not first-line treatment in infants and are reserved for cases with severe symptoms like esophagitis or when non-pharmacologic interventions fail. Schedule an urgent esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) (Option C): EGD is not the first step for managing infant GERD symptoms and is reserved for cases with persistent symptoms despite treatment or concerning signs like bleeding or significant weight loss. Antireflux surgery (fundoplication)(Option D) is reserved for severe GERD cases unresponsive to medical therapy or with complications like significant esophagitis, strictures, or a large hiatal hernia.

      },
      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: C) 1500 mL/day Explanation: To calculate the daily maintenance fluid requirement for pediatric patients, we use the following Hollidag Segar formula based on weight: For the first 10 kg: 100 mL/kg/day For the next 10 kg: 50 mL/kg/day For each kg above 20 kg: 20 mL/kg/day For a 6-year-old boy weighing 22 kg admitted with pneumonia and requiring IV fluids for maintenance hydration: For the first 10 kg: 10 kg × 100 mL/kg = 1000 mL For the next 12 kg: 10 kg × 50 mL/kg = 500 mL Total Daily Maintenance: 1000 mL + 500 mL = 1500 mL/day 1500 mL/day (Option C) is the most appropriate answer. The total fluid requirement for this child in the first 24 hours consists of three components: Deficit replacement (rehydration): For severe dehydration, we estimate a 10% fluid deficit Maintenance fluids Ongoing losses: Estimate 10 mL/kg for each watery stool and 2 mL/kg for each episode of vomiting.

        "D": "Half-Normal Saline"
      },
      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: C) Ringer's Lactate with 5% Dextrose Explanation: Ringer's Lactate with 5% Dextrose is commonly used for treating severe dehydration in children. It offers a balanced electrolyte composition similar to plasma, helps correct acidosis, and includes glucose to prevent hypoglycemia. Rapid intravenous rehydration is crucial. The total fluid volume is typically 100 mL/kg. For children >12 months: Administer over 3-4 hours. For infants <12 months: Administer over 6-8 hours. Continual reassessment is essential to adjust treatment based on the child’s response and hydration status. Warning signs of severe dehydration: Lethargy or altered consciousness Sunken eyes Unable to drink Cool, mottled extremities (indicating poor perfusion) Severely decreased skin turgor Weak or absent pulse 5% Dextrose solution (Option A) provides glucose but lacks adequate electrolytes and does not effectively correct acidosis or replace lost fluids in cases of severe dehydration. Normal Saline (Option B) is useful for initial fluid resuscitation but does not correct acidosis and is less balanced in electrolytes than Ringer's Lactate. Half-normal saline (Option C) contains lower sodium and chloride concentrations and does not correct acidosis, making it unsuitable for severe dehydration. Reference: O.P.

        "D": "Administer ondansetron and start a probiotic supplement"
      },
      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: C) Continue normal diet with adequate fluid intake and ORS. Explanation: In cases of acute diarrhoea in young children without signs of dehydration, continue the normal diet and use ORS (Oral Rehydration Solution) to support recovery, prevent nutritional deficiencies, and maintain hydration. Acute diarrhoea is defined as the passage of three or more loose or liquid stools per day, lasting < 14 days . It is often caused by gastrointestinal infections from viruses, bacteria, or parasites. Viral Bacterial Parasitic Rotavirus (Most common cause in children) Norovirus (Most common cause in adults) Adenovirus Escherichia coli (Most common bacterial cause) Salmonella Shigella Campylobacter Giardia lamblia (Most common parasitic cause) Cryptosporidium Entamoeba histolytica Management Aspects Recommendations Rehydration Use Oral Rehydration Solution (ORS) for most cases Start with small volumes if vomiting is present Consider IV for severe cases Nutrition Continue breastfeeding Reintroduce age-appropriate diet early Avoid fatty foods and simple sugars Zinc Supplementation <6 months: 10 mg/day >6 months: 20 mg/day Medications Antibiotics: Use judiciously, mainly for severe bacterial cases Ondansetron (for vomiting) Avoid antimotility agents Probiotics It may be beneficial, especially for rotavirus ORS Composition (WHO standard) Constituent mmol/L Sodium 75 Glucose 75 Potassium 20 Chloride 65 Citrate 10 Total osmolarity 245 Start ORS and withhold solid foods for 24 hours (Option A): While ORS is crucial, withholding food is outdated advice. Early refeeding with an age-appropriate diet is recommended to prevent nutritional deficits and doesn't delay recovery. Prescribe an antibiotic and advise clear fluids only (Option B) : Antibiotics aren't routinely recommended for acute diarrhoea, particularly in viral cases, and clear fluids alone do not meet nutritional needs. Administer ondansetron and start a probiotic supplement (Option D): Ondansetron is not needed since there is no vomiting, and probiotics are supplementary rather than primary treatment for diarrhoea.

      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: C) Some dehydration Explanation: The infant’s sunken fontanelle, dry mucous membranes, prolonged capillary refill, and slow skin recoil indicate ‘ some dehydration’ . Assessment of Dehydration in Children: Clinical Symptoms: Look for dry mucous membranes, sunken fontanelle (in infants), and irritability. Skin Turgor: Evaluate skin recoil; delayed recoil indicates dehydration . Capillary Refill Time: Assess capillary refill time; prolonged refill suggests dehydration. Urine Output: Monitor for decreased wet diapers or reduced frequency of urination. Vital Signs: Check for abnormal vital signs, such as elevated heart rate or low blood pressure. Mental Status and Behavior: Assess for changes in mental status, such as lethargy or confusion, which can indicate the severity of dehydration.

In contrast, advanced maternal age is not a risk factor for this condition. Risk Factors of Congenital hypertrophic pyloric stenosis Genetic Factors White race of northern European descent Male sex Familial History : Higher risk in offspring of mothers with CHPS (20% for sons, 10% for daughters) Twin Studies : Higher concordance in monozygotic twins suggests a genetic component Blood Groups : Infants with B and O blood groups. Environmental Factors Erythromycin Use : Especially if administered within the first two weeks of life Higher incidence in infants whose mothers used macrolides during pregnancy or breastfeeding, particularly in females. Other Associated Factors Other Congenital Defects Syndromes : Occasionally associated with tracheoesophageal fistula and hypoplasia or agenesis of the inferior labial frenulum.

      "explanation": "Correct Answer: A) Elongated pyloric channel on contrast studies Explanation: The clinical scenario is most likely Congenital hypertrophic pyloric stenosis (CHPS), a condition involving hypertrophy of the pyloric muscle, leading to gastric outlet obstruction in male infants, typically between 2 to 6 weeks of age. Clinical Presentation: Symptoms: Projectile, non-bilious vomiting after feeds, starting around 2 to 6 weeks of age. Physical Examination: Visible gastric peristalsis and a palpable “olive-shaped” mass in the epigastric region. Diagnosis: Ultrasound (USG) is the Investigation of choice for CHPS, characterised by Pyloric muscle thickness of > 3 mm (Option B ruled out) Pyloric length > 14 mm (Option C ruled out) The pyloric channel appears elongated and thickened (10-14 mm) Contrast Studies (Upper GI Series): Less frequently used, demonstrating the classic \"string sign\" with a thin line of contrast through the elongated and narrowed pyloric channel and delayed gastric emptying without duodenal dilation. (Option D) Characteristic findings of Contrast studies in CHPS Findings Description String Sign A thin line of contrast material passes through the narrowed pyloric channel, indicating severe narrowing due to hypertrophied muscle. Shoulder Sign A bulge of the hypertrophied pyloric muscle into the gastric antrum gives the appearance of a “shoulder.” Double Tract Sign Parallel streaks of contrast material within the narrowed pyloric channel suggest the presence of a narrow passage for contrast flow.
