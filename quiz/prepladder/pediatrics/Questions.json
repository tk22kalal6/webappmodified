      "explanation": "Moreover, a maintenance dose of potassium, with 1ml of KCl per 100ml, is also added to the solution. DNS (Dextrose Normal Saline) is used in children as a maintenance fluid because: Prevents Hypoglycemia: Provides around 17 calories/ 100ml of 5%D as energy , crucial for children with higher metabolic rates. It also prevents ketone production and minimises protein degradation . Maintains Fluid and Electrolyte Balance: Sodium chloride in DNS preserves extracellular fluid volume and prevents dehydration. Isotonic Solution: Stabilizes intravascular volume without causing fluid shifts. Hypotonic fluids like N/2 and N/4 saline (Option A, C, D) can cause hyponatraemia and hemolysis.

      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: C) Hypokalemia Explanation Vomiting and loose stools, along with cardiac arrhythmia, point to the diagnosis of hypokalemia . Normal serum potassium level: 3.5-5.5 meq/L. Hypokalemia is defined as a serum potassium level below 3.5 mEq/L. Mild hypokalemia: 3 - 3.5 mEq/L Moderate hypokalemia: 2.5 - 3.0 mEq/L Severe hypokalemia: <2.5 mEq/L Etiology: Common causes of hypokalemia in children include: Gastrointestinal losses (diarrhoea, vomiting) Renal losses (diuretics, renal tubular disorders) Inadequate intake Transcellular shifts (e.g., insulin administration, beta-agonists) Clinical features: Muscle weakness Fatigue Constipation Cardiac arrhythmias (in severe cases) Polyuria and polydipsia Treatment: The treatment of hypokalemia depends on its severity and the presence of symptoms. In this case, with moderate hypokalemia and symptoms, intravenous replacement is appropriate Potassium Supplementation: Indications for IV Potassium Supplementation: Symptomatic patients Severe hypokalemia (<2.5 mEq/L) Presence of ECG abnormalities Unable to tolerate oral feeds. IV Potassium Chloride Supplementation: Dosage: 0.5-1 mEq/kg per dose Administration: IV infusion over 1-2 hours Infusion Rate: Do not exceed 1 mEq/kg per hour Potassium Concentration: Maximum of 60 mEq/L for peripheral lines Maximum of 80 mEq/L for central lines Avoid using glucose-containing fluids to prevent insulin-mediated intracellular potassium shift. Oral Potassium Supplementation: Dosage: 2-4 mEq/kg per day, divided into 3-4 doses Common Preparations: Potassium chloride (10%; 20 mEq/15 mL) Potassium citrate (especially for renal tubular acidosis) Administration Tip: Liquid preparations can be bitter; dilute with juice or water to improve taste. Additional Management Considerations: Replace ongoing potassium losses Ensure volume resuscitation with normal saline Correct any associated hypomagnesemia Treat underlying conditions (e.g., monogenic hypertension, Bartter syndrome, Gitelman syndrome) Hyponatremia (Option A) can be caused due to GI losses but is not associated with cardiac arrhythmias. Hypocalcemia (Option B) is not associated with arrhythmias but rather presents with prolonged QT intervals and congestive cardiac failure. Hyperkalemia (Option D) is associated with cardiac arrhythmias but is not caused due to vomiting and diarrhoea. Reference: OP Ghai Essential Pediatrics, 10th Edition, Page 63, 64",

        "D": "200 mmol/L"
      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: B) 125 mmol/L Explanation: The clinical manifestations indicate dehydration in a malnourished child requiring ReSoMal (Rehydration Solution for Malnutrition). The patient presents with classic signs of dehydration including poor appetite, failure to thrive, loss of skin turgor, and dry mucous membranes . ReSoMal is specifically formulated for malnourished children with a precise glucose concentration of 125 mmol/L . This solution differs from standard oral rehydration solutions by having lower sodium and higher potassium content to address the specific needs of malnourished children. The osmolality of approximately 300 mOsm/L helps maintain appropriate fluid balance during rehydration. Composition of Rehydration Solutions Component Resomal (300 mOsm/L) Standard ORS (311 mOsm/L) Reduced Osmolarity ORS (245 mOsm/L) Sodium 45 mmol/L 90 mmol/L 75 mmol/L Potassium 40 mmol/L 20 mmol/L 20 mmol/L Chloride 70 mmol/L 80 mmol/L 65 mmol/L Citrate 7 mmol/L 10 mmol/L 10 mmol/L Glucose 125 mmol/L 111 mmol/L 75 mmol/L Zinc 40 µ mol/L - - Copper 70 µ mol/L - - Magnesium 3 mmol/L - - Total Osmolarity 300 mOsm/L 311 mOsm/L 245 mOsm/L 100 mmol/L (Option A) : This glucose concentration is too low for effective rehydration in malnourished children. A lower glucose concentration would not provide adequate carbohydrate substrate for sodium-glucose cotransport in the intestine. 150 mmol/L (Option C) : This concentration exceeds the recommended glucose content for ReSoMal. Higher glucose concentrations can lead to osmotic diarrhea and worsen dehydration. 200 mmol/L (Option D) : This concentration is significantly higher than the standard ReSoMal formulation. Such high glucose concentrations can cause osmotic fluid shifts and potentially worsen the child's condition.

      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: B) 0.9% Normal Saline in 5% Dextrose (N 5% D) Explanation: Current Best Practice : Isotonic fluids are now preferred for maintenance therapy in children, as recommended by: American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP, 2018) European Society of Pediatric and Neonatal Intensive Care (ESPNIC) WHO and national health bodies These guidelines were updated due to the risk of hospital-acquired hyponatraemia associated with hypotonic fluids. Reason for Isotonic Preference : Children have higher levels of antidiuretic hormone (ADH) during illness or stress → increased risk of water retention and dilutional hyponatraemia. 0.9% Normal Saline maintains plasma tonicity and reduces this risk. Role of Dextrose and Potassium : 5% Dextrose : Prevents hypoglycaemia and provides energy. Potassium (usually 20 mmol/L KCl) : Often added unless contraindicated, especially if the child is not eating or passing urine. 0.2% NS + 5% Dextrose (Option A) : Too hypotonic → high risk of hyponatraemia. 0.45% NS + 10% Dextrose (Option C) : Still hypotonic, and 10% Dextrose is excessive for routine use. 0.225% NS + 5% Dextrose (Option D) : Also hypotonic; once commonly used but now largely outdated.

      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: C) 1, 3, 4 Explanation: In a child presenting with diarrhea, vomiting, and altered sensorium, the differential diagnosis should focus on conditions associated with metabolic derangements, dehydration, and potential neurological complications. Severe Dehydration (1): Prolonged diarrhea and vomiting can lead to hypovolemia and electrolyte imbalances, resulting in altered sensorium. This is one of the most common causes of altered mental status in children with diarrheal illness. Cerebral Venous Thrombosis (CVT) (3): Severe dehydration increases the risk of thrombosis due to hemoconcentration. CVT can present with seizures, altered sensorium, and focal neurological signs. Hyponatremia (4): Excessive water intake or inappropriate antidiuretic hormone (ADH) release in response to dehydration can cause dilutional hyponatremia. Symptoms include seizures, lethargy, and altered sensorium. Hemolytic Uremic Syndrome (HUS) (2): This condition is typically associated with bloody diarrhea, which is absent in the clinical presentation. HUS is caused by Shiga toxin-producing E. coli and usually occurs several days after an initial diarrheal illness. Reference: O.P Ghai Essential Paediatrics, 10th Edition, Page: 487,488, 572.",

ISPAD Guidelines – Initial Management of DKA : ABC Stabilisation : Always assess and stabilise airway, breathing, and circulation first. Fluid Resuscitation : In severe dehydration or shock , give 0.9% Normal Saline (NS) 10–20 mL/kg over 1–2 hours . In this case (30 kg child with severe dehydration), give 20 mL/kg → 600 mL NS bolus . Insulin : Do not start insulin immediately . Begin insulin infusion after at least 1 hour of fluid resuscitation , to avoid rapid shifts in osmolality and risk of cerebral oedema. Dose: 0.05–0.1 IU/kg/hour , IV infusion. Diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA): DKA is a frequent complication in children and adolescents with type 1 or type 2 diabetes mellitus. Clinical signs: Dehydration Tachycardia and tachypnea Kussmaul respiration : Deep sighing respiration with a ketotic breath odor (like nail polish remover or rotten fruit). Gastrointestinal symptoms : Nausea, vomiting, and abdominal pain. Neurological symptoms : Confusion, drowsiness, progressive loss of consciousness. Biochemical criteria for DKA diagnosis : Hyperglycemia : Blood glucose >11 mmol/L or ≥ 200 mg/dL. Acidosis: Venous: pH <7.3 and/or bicarbonate <15 mmol/L. Ketosis : Ketonemia: Blood β -hydroxybutyrate concentration ≥ 3 mmol/L. Ketonuria: Moderate or large ketones in urine. DKA Management in Children Immediate Management (First Hour): Rapid Assessment: Evaluate the child's vital signs (heart rate, respiratory rate, blood pressure) and weight. Assess GCS and check for signs of dehydration. Obtain blood samples for urgent measurement of blood glucose, blood beta-hydroxybutyrate (BHB) if available, venous pH, electrolytes (including bicarbonate), serum urea nitrogen, and creatinine. Serum BHB concentration : Most precise approach to measuring the severity of DKA Establish IV Access: Place two large-bore peripheral IV lines. Central lines are generally avoided (risk of thrombosis) unless necessary. Initial Fluid Resuscitation Administer a bolus of 0.9% saline at a rate of 10-20 ml/kg over 20-30 minutes to restore circulatory volume and address dehydration. After First Hour Initiate Insulin Therapy Start an intravenous insulin infusion at 0.05-0.1 U/kg/h , typically one hour after initiating fluids. Continue Fluid Therapy After the initial bolus, continue fluid replacement with 0.45% to 0.9% saline, to replace the estimated fluid deficit over 24 to 48 hours. Adjust fluids based on clinical status and laboratory values. Monitoring and Replacing Electrolytes Begin potassium replacement once urine output is confirmed as insulin causes K+ entry into cells, leading to hypokalemia. Monitor vital signs, GCS, fluid balance, and capillary blood glucose every hour. Reassess electrolytes, blood glucose, blood urea nitrogen, calcium, magnesium, phosphate, blood gases, and BOHB every two hours if available.

The patient presents with characteristic features including irritability, hasty drinking, sunken eyes, and delayed skin pinch test, which are classic signs of severe dehydration requiring immediate intervention. In cases of severe dehydration, the most appropriate treatment would be to start intravenous (IV) fluids, administer IV antibiotics, and refer to a higher centre. Assessment and Management of Dehydration: Degree of Dehydration Clinical Features Management Mild Slightly increased thirst Normal urine output Normal skin turgor Oral rehydration therapy (ORT) with a solution containing electrolytes and glucose Encourage the child to drink small, frequent amounts of the ORT solution Continue regular feeding if the child is not vomiting or unable to tolerate oral intake Moderate Increased thirst Decreased urine output Decreased tears Dry mucous membranes Delayed capillary refill (>2 seconds) Oral rehydration therapy (ORT) with a solution containing electrolytes and glucose Administer ORT in larger amounts and more frequently Monitor vital signs (heart rate, blood pressure), urine output, and mental status Consider antiemetic medication if vomiting is present If unable to tolerate oral intake or deteriorating clinical status, consider intravenous fluids Severe Markedly increased thirst Minimal or no urine output Sunken eyes, lethargy, irritability Cool extremities, mottled or pale skin Altered mental status, decreased consciousness Initiate intravenous fluids with a bolus of isotonic saline or lactated Ringer's solution Administer maintenance intravenous fluids and correct electrolyte imbalances as necessary Monitor vital signs closely, including heart rate, blood pressure, oxygen saturation Address underlying causes, such as infections or other medical conditions Consider transfer to a higher level of care if there are signs of severe or life-threatening dehydration Administer the first dose of IV antibiotic and immediately refer to a higher centre (Option A): While antibiotic therapy may be indicated in some cases of diarrhea, the priority in this scenario is to address the dehydration and provide appropriate fluid replacement. Referral to a higher center is necessary for the management of severe dehydration. Give oral fluids and ask the mother to continue the same and visit again the next day (Option B): Given the signs of dehydration mentioned, providing oral fluids alone may not be adequate to correct the dehydration rapidly. Prompt intervention with IV fluids is required in severe dehydration cases.

      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: B) Down Syndrome Explanation: The karyotype is showing three copies of chromosome 21 , which indicates it is a case of Down syndrome. Down Syndrome is a chromosomal disorder caused by the presence of an extra copy of chromosome 21, resulting in a total of 47 chromosomes instead of the normal 46. Key features of Karyotyping: A karyotype is a visual representation of an individual's chromosomes, arranged in pairs by size and position of the centromere. In a normal human karyotype, 46 chromosomes are arranged in 23 pairs (22 pairs of autosomes and 1 pair of sex chromosomes). The chromosomes are photographed during metaphase, when they are most condensed and visible. They are then arranged in descending order of size, with the sex chromosomes placed last. Turner Syndrome (Option A) is characterized by monosomy X, which means there is an absence or partial deletion of one of the X chromosomes, resulting in a karyotype of 45, XO. The presented karyotype shows three copies of chromosome 21, not a missing X chromosome. Turner syndrome affects only females and is associated with short stature and ovarian dysfunction. Klinefelter Syndrome (Option C) presents with an extra X chromosome in males , resulting in a karyotype of 47, XXY. The karyotype image clearly shows trisomy 21, not an extra X chromosome. Klinefelter syndrome is characterized by tall stature, infertility, and delayed puberty. Edward Syndrome (Option D) also known as Trisomy 18, is caused by an extra copy of chromosome 18, resulting in a karyotype of 47, XX+18 or 47, XY+18. The provided karyotype shows an extra chromosome 21, not chromosome 18. Edward syndrome is associated with severe developmental delays and multiple congenital anomalies.

      "explanation": "Correct Answer C- Fragile X syndrome Explanation: The patient presents with the classic triad of physical features , including a long face, large ears, and macroorchidism (large testes), along with intellectual disability (IQ 45) and a cardiac murmur suggestive of mitral valve prolapse , which indicates Fragile X syndrome. The X-linked inheritance pattern is supported by the paternal family history of poor intellectual function. This condition is caused by a CGG trinucleotide repeat expansion in the FMR1 gene on the X chromosome , making it the most common inherited cause of intellectual disability. Fragile X Syndrome: Genetic Basis CGG repeats on FMR-1 (Familial mental retardation) gene on X chromosome CGG Repeat Numbers Normal population: 5-55 repeats Carriers (premutation): 55-200 repeats Fragile X Syndrome: >200 repeats Gender Prevalence More common in males (X-Linked Dominant Inheritance) Females mostly carriers Clinical Features Long face & large ears Large mandible/Prominent jaw High arched palate Hyperextensible joints Mitral valve prolapse Macroorchidism/large testes (seen in adolescent age group) Intellectual disability Clinical features of female carriers May be associated with premature ovarian failure 10% may have an intellectual disability/low IQ Incorrect options: Cushing's syndrome (Option A): While this condition can affect growth and development, it typically presents with central obesity, moon face, and buffalo hump. The characteristic features of large ears and macroorchidism are not associated with Cushing's syndrome. Rett syndrome (Option B): This condition primarily affects females and is characterized by progressive loss of motor functions such as inability to speak, use hands, walk or perform other activities. It does not present with distinctive facial features or macroorchidism. William syndrome (Option D): While this condition can cause intellectual disability and cardiac abnormalities, it typically presents with elfin facies and a distinctive \"cocktail party\" personality.

        "B": "MRI T2 myocardium",
        "C": "Serum ferritin",
        "D": "NTBI"
      },
      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: A) Liver iron concentration Explanation: Liver iron concentration is the best method to detect iron overload in thalassemia patients undergoing multiple blood transfusions. Iron Overload in Thalassemia: Iron Overload Mechanisms in Thalassemia: TDT (Transfusion-Dependent Thalassemia): Regular blood transfusions lead to iron accumulation (0.3-0.6 mg/kg per day). Iron is released into plasma after transfused red blood cells are phagocytized and binds to transferrin. Once transferrin is saturated, non-transferrin-bound iron enters organs like the liver , heart, and endocrine glands. Iron accumulation causes organ damage via reactive oxygen species. NTDT (Non-Transfusion-Dependent Thalassemia): Increased intestinal iron absorption due to hepcidin suppression and ineffective erythropoiesis. Iron primarily accumulates in the liver , not the myocardium, unlike in TDT. Diagnosis and Quantification of Iron Overload: Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI): MRI with R2 or T2 technique is the gold standard for quantifying liver iron concentration (LIC) and cardiac iron in thalassemia. Iron Overload Thresholds: LIC in NTDT: Values >5 mg/g correlate with increased morbidity. LIC in TDT: 7 mg/g dw indicates increased risk of complications. 15 mg/g dw is predictive of advanced liver fibrosis and increased cardiac risk. Cardiac T2 MRI: (Option B) <10 ms predicts higher risk of heart failure and mortality. 10-20 ms is linked to reduced left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) and arrhythmias. However there can be discrepancy between liver iron and cardiac iron levels. Serum Ferritin Assessment: (Option C) Used as a screening tool. Ferritin levels correlate with hepatic iron overload in both TDT and NTDT. However, it is not as accurate for detecting iron overload in thalassemia patients, as ferritin levels can be elevated due to other factors (e.g., inflammation). Non-Transferrin-Bound Iron (NTBI): (Option D) Refers to iron that is not bound to transferrin, typically occurring in iron overload conditions when iron exceeds the binding capacity of transferrin. NTBI is a labile form of iron that can contribute to iron toxicity. While NTBI can serve as an indicator of iron overload, it is influenced by plasma factors like citrate, uric acid, and albumin. Management of Iron Overload in Thalassemia: Iron Chelation Therapy (ICT): Aims to manage iron stores, reduce iron in tissues, and reverse heart failure. Three main chelators used: Deferoxamine (DFO), Deferiprone (DFP), and Deferasirox (DFX). TDT: Start ICT after 10 transfusions or by age 2 years. NTDT: Begin assessment at age 10, with consideration for MRI-based evaluation of organ-specific iron load from age 8-10 years. Reference: https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6142532/",

In addition to genetic factors, environmental factors such as maternal folic acid deficiency, certain medications, and exposure to toxins can also increase the risk of NTDs. Therefore, the inheritance pattern in NTDs is considered to be multifactorial, meaning that genetic and environmental factors contribute to the development of the condition. Incorrect Choices: a.

Growth failure typically becomes evident by age 3-5 years, and final adult height is significantly reduced without growth hormone therapy. Decreased carrying angle (Option C): Turner syndrome is characterized by an increased carrying angle (cubitus valgus), not a decreased angle. This increased carrying angle is one of the characteristic skeletal manifestations of the condition. Gynecomastia (Option D): Gynecomastia is not a feature of Turner syndrome. Gynecomastia is associated with Klinefelter syndrome (47,XXY). Turner syndrome typically presents with widely spaced nipples on a shield-shaped chest.

      "explanation": "Correct Answer: A) HOXA13 Explanation: Hand-Foot-Genital Syndrome (HFGS): Rare, dominantly inherited condition affecting distal limbs and genitourinary tract. Genetic cause: Identified mutation in the HOXA13 homeobox gene. HFGS is the second human syndrome linked to a HOX gene mutation. Clinical Characteristics: Limb Malformations: Bilateral shortening of thumbs and great toes, typically involving distal phalanx or first metacarpal/metatarsal. Impaired dexterity or thumb apposition due to the malformations. Urogenital Defects: In females: Abnormalities in the ureters and urethra, incomplete müllerian fusion. In males: Hypospadias with or without chordee. Associated conditions: Vesicoureteral reflux, recurrent urinary tract infections, and chronic pyelonephritis. Normal fertility. Diagnosis and Testing: Clinical Diagnosis: Physical examination, radiographs of hands/feet, and imaging of kidneys, bladder, and female reproductive tract. Genetic Diagnosis: Identification of a heterozygous HOXA13 pathogenic variant confirms diagnosis if clinical/radiographic features are unclear. Management: Treatment of Manifestations: Surgery for hand/foot malformations is usually unnecessary. Ureteric reimplantation and bladder outlet abnormality correction often needed. Rare surgical correction for vaginal septum or uterine abnormalities, unless recurrent pregnancy loss occurs. Prevention of Secondary Complications: Prophylactic antibiotics or surgery for urinary tract issues. Gynecological exams before menstruation for hymenal constriction. Pre-pregnancy evaluation for uterine and vaginal anatomy due to risks in pregnancy. BCL6 gene (Option B) mutations are associated with B cell lymphomas and other cancers. FGFR gene (Option C) mutation causes skeletal disorders, mainly dwarfism and craniofacial malformations. COI 11 (Option D) mutation is associated with hearing loss.

The disorder can skip generations and is typically seen in individuals who have two affected parents or when both parents are carriers. Examples of autosomal-recessive disorders include cystic fibrosis and sickle cell anemia. Incorrect Options: Option A: Autosomal-dominant disorder: In an autosomal-dominant disorder, the affected individual has a 50% chance of passing on the mutated gene to each offspring. The disorder typically appears in every generation, and both males and females can be affected. Unaffected individuals do not transmit the disorder to their offspring. Examples of autosomal-dominant disorders include Huntington's disease and Marfan syndrome. Option B: X-linked dominant disorder: In an X-linked dominant disorder, an affected male passes the mutated gene to all of his daughters but none of his sons. Affected females have a 50% chance of passing on the mutated gene to each offspring, regardless of gender. The disorder can appear in every generation, but it is more commonly observed in females.

Incorrect Options: Option B - Hereditary fructose intolerance due to aldolase B deficiency: Hereditary fructose intolerance results from a deficiency in aldolase B, leading to the accumulation of fructose-1-phosphate after ingestion of fructose, sucrose, or sorbitol. Symptoms include vomiting, hypoglycemia, and liver damage. The Benedict’s test would show a positive result for fructose, but this condition typically presents after the introduction of fructose-containing foods, not in the newborn period. Option C - Glucose-6-Phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency: G6PD deficiency leads to hemolytic anemia, particularly after exposure to certain triggers like infections or certain foods/drugs. This condition does not typically cause a positive Benedict’s test for a non-glucose substance, nor does it present with vomiting after feeding. Option D - Galactosemia due to galactokinase enzyme deficiency: This milder form of galactosemia results from a deficiency in galactokinase, leading to the accumulation of galactose, which can cause cataracts. However, it usually does not cause severe systemic symptoms like those seen in GAL-1-P uridyl transferase deficiency, and the Benedict’s test would still be positive for galactose.",

      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: A) Pompe disease Explanation: Pompe disease is a glycogen storage disorder (Type II) caused by a deficiency of acid alpha-glucosidase (acid maltase). It leads to the accumulation of glycogen in lysosomes, primarily affecting cardiac and skeletal muscle. Clinical features include: Floppy infant with profound hypotonia (\"floppy baby\") Cardiomegaly due to hypertrophic cardiomyopathy Hepatomegaly from glycogen accumulation Respiratory distress and feeding difficulties The combination of hypotonia, hepatomegaly, and cardiomegaly on X-ray fits classic infantile Pompe disease. Transposition of the Great Arteries (TGA) (Option B): TGA is a cyanotic congenital heart defect with discordant ventriculoarterial connections. Presents with cyanosis, not hypotonia or hepatomegaly. Cardiomegaly may be present, but hepatomegaly and hypotonia are not typical. Tetralogy of Fallot (TOF) (Option C): TOF is a cyanotic congenital heart disease with right ventricular outflow obstruction, ventricular septal defect, overriding aorta, and RV hypertrophy. Presents with cyanosis and \"tet spells.\" Hypotonia and hepatomegaly are not usual features. Ebstein's anomaly (Option D): A congenital malformation of the tricuspid valve causing atrialization of the right ventricle. Presents with cyanosis, heart failure signs, but does not typically cause hypotonia or hepatomegaly in infancy.

Lesch-Nyhan syndrome, an X-linked recessive disorder , is caused by a deficiency of hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyltransferase (HGPRT), which results in impaired purine metabolism. Pathophysiology: HGPRT deficiency leads to: Accumulation of purine metabolites Excessive uric acid production Neurological complications (dystonia and spasticity) Lesch-Nyhan syndrome Cause Deficiency of hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyltransferase (HPRT) Inheritance X-linked recessive Variants Classic Lesch-Nyhan syndrome : Undetectable HPRT levels. Kelley-Seegmiller syndrome : Partial HPRT deficiency with variable neurological dysfunction. Clinical Features Self-injurious behaviour : Biting lips, fingers, tongue; begins with tooth eruption. Cognitive impairment : Intellectual disability ranging from mild to severe. Movement disorder : Starts with hypotonia, progresses to dystonia, choreoathetosis, oromandibular dystonia, and inspiratory stridor. Oculomotor apraxia : Difficulty controlling eye movements. Dysarthric speech : Difficulty speaking clearly. Complications Hyperuricemia : Causes gout and kidney stones. Neurological symptoms : Abnormalities in the dopamine system, reduced dopamine transporters. Treatment Allopurinol : Reduces uric acid levels and manages hyperuricemia. Symptom management : Controls movement disorders and self-injurious behaviours. Incorrect Options: Cystathionine beta-synthase (Option A): This enzyme is involved in homocysteine metabolism, and its deficiency would lead to homocystinuria with manifestations like lens dislocation, skeletal abnormalities, and thromboembolism . It does not cause hyperuricemia or self-mutilating behavior. Dihydrothymidine oxidase (Option B): This enzyme is involved in pyrimidine metabolism, and its deficiency would not cause elevated uric acid levels or neurological symptoms seen in this case. Xanthine oxidase (Option D): Deficiency of this enzyme causes xanthinuria, characterized by low uric acid levels, not elevation as seen in this case. Its manifestations include abdominal pain, recurrent UTI, hematuria & muscle cramping. Reference: Nelson Textbook of Pediatrics, 21st Edition, Page 3158",

Vincristine is a chemotherapy agent that inhibits cell division, and Prednisolone is a corticosteroid that helps reduce inflammation and has antitumor effects. This option is appropriate if the child's symptoms are indicative of ALL, as the high WBC count and symptoms like hepatosplenomegaly and purpura are consistent with leukemia. Incorrect Options: Option B – IVIG: Intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) is used for treating immune thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP) and other conditions involving immune-mediated platelet destruction. While IVIG can be beneficial in conditions with bleeding tendencies, it is not typically used as the primary treatment for leukemia. Option C - L-Asparaginase + Prednisolone: L-Asparaginase is an enzyme used in the treatment of acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) as part of a chemotherapy regimen. It works by depleting asparagine, an amino acid necessary for leukemia cell survival. Prednisolone is a corticosteroid used to enhance the effects of chemotherapy and reduce inflammation. This combination is appropriate for treating ALL, but without additional context, it’s less specific than Vincristine + Prednisolone in a classic ALL regimen. Option D - Daunorubicin + Prednisolone: Daunorubicin is a chemotherapy drug used primarily in the treatment of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and sometimes in acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). Prednisolone is a corticosteroid used to support chemotherapy treatment. This combination is generally used for AML rather than ALL.",

Unconjugated bilirubin is water-insoluble and bound to albumin, preventing urinary excretion. Instead, intestinal bacteria convert it to urobilinogen and stercobilinogen, which are eliminated in stool. (Options B & D) Urine bilirubin consists of conjugated bilirubin, which requires hepatic processing.

      "explanation": "Correct Answer: D) Globin gene sequencing Explanation: In this case, the presence of target cells and a history of repeated blood transfusions suggests a possible hemoglobinopathy, such as thalassemia or sickle cell disease . Globin gene sequencing is a molecular diagnostic test that can identify specific mutations or genetic alterations in the globin genes. By sequencing the globin genes, such as the alpha and beta globin genes, it is possible to identify the specific genetic abnormality responsible for the hemoglobinopathy. High-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) (Option A) is a commonly used method to measure the different types of hemoglobin and their variants in the blood. While HPLC can help in identifying abnormal hemoglobin variants, it may not provide a definitive diagnosis of the underlying genetic abnormality causing the hemoglobinopathy. Estimating ferritin levels (Option B) can provide information about the iron stores in the body but may not directly help in diagnosing the underlying cause of the anemia or the specific genetic abnormality causing the hemoglobinopathy. While bone marrow examination (Option C) can provide valuable information about the cells in the bone marrow, it may not always be necessary for the definitive diagnosis of hemoglobinopathy Reference: Ghai Essential Pediatrics, 10th edition, Page 363",

      "correct_answer": "D",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: D) Education, counseling, and watchful expectancy Explanation: In a patient with mild ITP who has bruising, petechiae, and occasional minor epistaxis but minimal interference with daily activities , the preferred approach is watchful expectancy. Most cases of mild ITP in children resolve spontaneously without treatment. Regular follow-up visits can help assess the progression of the disease and determine the need for intervention if symptoms worsen or if there is an increase in bleeding risk. The observation period involves providing education and counseling to the patient and closely monitoring platelet counts and symptoms over time. Management of Immune thrombocytopenic purpura in children Based on platelet count: Platelet Count >30,000 cells/ µ L + No severe bleeding- Monitor closely Platelet Count < 30,000 cells/ µ L + No severe bleeding + Platelet Count ≥ 5,000 cells/ µ L: Glucocorticoids (e.g., Prednisone , Dexamethasone) Platelet Count < 5,000 cells/ µ L or Severe Bleeding: i.v.i.g.+ Glucocorticoids Other modalities: Immediate Need to Raise Platelet Count like surgery or trauma- Platelet Transfusion Persistent or Severe Cases- Monitor with intermittent i.v.i.g. If necessary, consider Splenectomy Alternative Medications: Anti-CD20 Antibody: Rituximab TPO Receptor Agonists: Romiplostim, Eltrombopag Short course corticosteroid therapy (Option A) is not indicated as the first-line treatment for mild ITP with minimal symptoms. While corticosteroids like prednisone are effective, their side effects outweigh the benefits in mild cases. Corticosteroids are typically reserved for cases with more severe thrombocytopenia or significant bleeding risk. Intravenous anti-D administration (Option B) is an intervention reserved for Rh-positive patients with more severe ITP requiring rapid platelet count elevation. In mild cases with minimal symptoms, this aggressive approach is unnecessary and carries potential risks. A single dose of intravenous immunoglobulin (Option C) represents an aggressive and costly intervention that is not warranted in mild ITP cases. IVIG is typically reserved for severe cases with significant bleeding risk or very low platelet counts (<5,000/ µ L). Reference: Ghai Essential Pediatrics, 10th Edition, Pages 371-373",

The two main types of leukemia in children are acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) and acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Symptoms can include fatigue, pale skin, frequent infections, easy bruising or bleeding, bone pain, swollen lymph nodes, and weight loss. Treatment for leukemia typically involves chemotherapy, sometimes combined with radiation therapy and stem cell transplantation. Incorrect options Option A) Retinoblastoma: Retinoblastoma is a rare form of eye cancer that primarily affects young children. It develops in the retina, the light-sensitive tissue at the back of the eye. Retinoblastoma may be hereditary or sporadic (non-hereditary). The most common sign is the presence of a white pupil or a noticeable difference in the color of the pupil between the two eyes. Other symptoms may include strabismus (crossed or misaligned eyes), poor vision, and eye pain. Treatment options include chemotherapy, radiation therapy, cryotherapy (freezing the tumor), and surgical removal of the affected eye. Option C) Wilms tumor: Wilms tumor, also known as nephroblastoma, is a type of kidney cancer that primarily affects children. It usually occurs in children aged 3 to 4 years. The most common sign is the presence of a painless abdominal mass or swelling. Other symptoms may include abdominal pain, fever, and blood in the urine. Treatment involves surgical removal of the tumor, followed by chemotherapy and sometimes radiation therapy. The prognosis for Wilms tumor is generally favorable, with high survival rates. Option D ) Neuroblastoma: Neuroblastoma is a cancer that develops from immature nerve cells, primarily affecting children aged 5 years or younger. It usually arises in the adrenal glands (located on top of the kidneys) or in nerve tissue along the spine, chest, abdomen, or pelvis. Neuroblastoma may cause various symptoms depending on the location and extent of the tumor, such as abdominal pain, a palpable mass, bone pain, fever, weight loss, and changes in bowel or bladder function. Treatment options include surgery, chemotherapy, radiation therapy, and immunotherapy. The prognosis for neuroblastoma can vary widely depending on factors such as the age at diagnosis, stage of the disease, and genetic characteristics. Reference: .",

While cystic fibrosis can cause liver damage and biliary cirrhosis due to obstructed bile ducts, biliary atresia is a separate congenital condition where there is a complete absence or abnormality of the bile ducts, leading to severe liver damage and jaundice. Cystic fibrosis (CF) is an autosomal recessive genetic disorder caused by mutations in the CFTR gene on chromosome 7q31.2 ( m/c mutation is ∆ F508), leading to a defective CFTR protein.

      "explanation": "Correct Answer: C) Day-night variation of FEV1 >15% Explanation: In asthma, lung function typically shows significant variability during the day, but the day-night variation of FEV1 is usually <15%. A variation >15% may indicate other conditions such as sleep apnea, or vocal cord dysfunction. Investigations of Asthma: Spirometry: Airflow limitation: Low FEV1 (relative to the percentage of predicted norms) FEV1/FVC ratio <0.80 (Option B) Bronchodilator response (to inhaled ß-agonist) assesses reversibility Reversibility is determined by an increase in either FEV1 >12% or Predicted FEV1 >12% after inhalation of a short-acting ß-agonist (SABA) (Option A) Exercise challenge: Worsening in FEV1 ≥ 15% (Option D) Daily peak expiratory flow (PEF) or FEV1 monitoring: Day-to-day and/or AM-to-PM variation ≥ 20% Exhaled nitric oxide (FeNO): A value of >20 ppb supports the clinical diagnosis of asthma in children FeNO can be used to predict response to ICS therapy Chest Radiographs: Chest radiographs often appear normal. May show subtle signs such as hyperinflation (flattening of the diaphragms) and peribronchial thickening Allergy Testing: Assesses sensitization to inhalant allergens.

Life-Threatening Asthma Management Overview Most severe asthma exacerbations require immediate attention. Indicators: Cyanosis, silent chest, poor respiratory effort, exhaustion, altered mental state, PEF <30%, oxygen saturation <90%. Immediate Management Oxygen Therapy : Administer for hypoxemia. Systemic Bronchodilators : Terbutaline or adrenaline subcutaneously; inhaled bronchodilators ( salbutamol , ipratropium). Systemic Corticosteroids: IV hydrocortisone (5 mg/kg). ICU Transfer: For monitoring and advanced care. ICU Management Continuous Monitoring: Vital signs, oxygen saturation, PEF. If Improvement Noted: Continue inhaled bronchodilators (salbutamol/terbutaline) every 20-30 minutes. Maintain hydrocortisone at 2-3 mg/kg every 6-8 hours until the patient can take oral medication. If No Improvement or Deterioration: Consider slow intravenous infusion of magnesium sulfate (50 mg/kg). Alternatively, administer a loading dose of theophylline. If these measures fail, prepare for mechanical ventilation. Address Underlying Causes: Check for acidosis, pneumothorax, electrolyte imbalance, and infection. Options B, C, and D are insufficient methods for the treatment of severe acute exacerbation of asthma and are hence incorrect.

      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: B) Cystic fibrosis Explanation: Chloride level in sweat is used to diagnose c ystic fibrosis. Cystic fibrosis is an autosomal recessive disorder caused by a mutation in the CFTR gene located on chromosome 7q32. Diagnostic Criteria for Cystic Fibrosis (CF): Presence of one or more phenotypic features (or) A history of Cystic Fibrosis in a sibling (or) A positive neonatal screening test - Dried blood is checked for immunoreactive trypsinogen. Plus Laboratory evidence for CFTR (Cystic Fibrosis transmembrane regulator) dysfunction: Two elevated sweat chloride concentrations (highly specific test) obtained at separate labs > 60 mEq/L (or) Identification of two Cystic Fibrosis mutations by DNA sequencing (or) An abnormal transepithelial nasal potential difference measurement Investigations: Sweat Chloride Test: The gold standard for CF diagnosis , especially in symptomatic patients. Pilocarpine iontophoresis is used to stimulate sweat production, and chloride concentration is measured. A chloride concentration of: ≥ 60 mmol/L confirms CF in children and adults. 30-59 mmol/L indicates intermediate results, requiring further evaluation. In CF- sweat chloride levels are increased, while chloride levels are decreased in pancreatic secretions. Genetic Testing: Genetic testing, particularly for the common F508del mutation , is conducted if CF is suspected. Expanded genetic panels may include hundreds of mutations but are often limited in efficacy for rare variants. Nasal Potential Difference (NPD): This test measures the bioelectric properties of the respiratory epithelium, reflecting CFTR function. In CF, defective chloride and sodium transport leads to abnormal potential differences. NPD testing is helpful when sweat chloride tests are inconclusive and can provide a more direct assessment of CFTR functionality. Other Tests: Fecal Elastase: Used to evaluate pancreatic exocrine function, which is impaired in CF. Chest Imaging: Although not diagnostic, imaging can assess lung disease severity, showing bronchiectasis and hyperinflation common in CF patients. Transepithelial Intestinal and Rectal Biopsies: These can be used to directly evaluate CFTR function, though they are generally reserved for research or challenging cases. Serum electrolytes - hyponatremic, hypokalemic, hypochloremic alkalosis are seen in CF (contraction alkalosis) Phenylketonuria (Option A) is caused by a deficiency in phenylalanine hydroxylase , leading to high levels of phenylalanine. It is diagnosed by measuring plasma phenylalanine concentration, not by sweat chloride testing. Gaucher’s disease (Option C) results from a deficiency of ß-glucosidase, and diagnosis is made by testing ß-glucosidase activity in fibroblasts or leukocytes, along with genetic testing, not by sweat chloride levels. Osteogenesis imperfecta (Option D) is caused by mutations in type-1 collagen genes, and it is diagnosed through genetic testing or DNA sequencing, not through sweat chloride measurement.

      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: B) Lecithin Explanation: Respiratory distress syndrome in a neonate is likely due to a deficiency of Lecithin. Respiratory Distress Syndrome/Hyaline Membrane Disease (HMD): It is a common respiratory condition in preterm infants (<34 weeks of gestation) caused by surfactant deficiency. Pathophysiology: Surfactant is primarily produced by type II alveolar cells and reduces surface tension, preventing alveolar collapse at the end of expiration. Surfactant is composed of phospholipids, proteins, and lipids. Phosphatidylcholine, also known as lecithin , is a significant phospholipid in mature surfactants. Its production begins around 20 weeks of gestation and peaks at 35 weeks, so infants born before 35 weeks are at higher risk for RDS due to insufficient surfactant. Without adequate surfactant, alveoli collapse during expiration, impairing gas exchange and causing tissue hypoxia. This results in increased pulmonary pressure, ischemic damage, and the formation of a hyaline membrane from protein transudation. Clinical Features: Respiratory distress within the first 6 hours of life is characterised by tachypnea, retractions, grunting, cyanosis, and decreased air entry. Typical X-ray findings in RDS include: Ground glass haziness of lungs: Represents diffuse alveolar atelectasis, commonly seen in RDS. Presence of air bronchogram: Air-filled bronchi are visible against the hazy, collapsed alveoli, a classic feature of RDS. Air bronchogram can be seen in parenchymal pathology of the lung, such as consolidation, pulmonary alveolar proteinosis. Reticulogranular pattern: Another term for the ground-glass appearance, indicating the fine, granular pattern throughout the lungs characteristic of RDS. Management: Neonates with this condition require admission to the neonatal intensive care unit, IV fluids, and appropriate respiratory support. Further management details are depicted in the table below, Dipalmitoyl inositol (Option A) : While it serves as a precursor in secondary messenger systems and plays roles in cell signaling and membrane trafficking, it is not involved in surfactant production or the prevention of respiratory distress syndrome. Sphingomyelin (Option C) is the dominant sphingolipid in the plasma membrane. The lecithin/sphingomyelin (L/S) ratio in amniotic fluid is a marker of fetal lung maturity, but sphingomyelin itself does not directly contribute to alveolar stability. Dipalmitoylphosphatidylethanolamine (Option D) : Found in cell membranes, it lacks the essential surface tension-reducing properties of dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine (lecithin), which is crucial for preventing alveolar collapse and respiratory distress syndrome.",

      "explanation": "Correct Answer: A) Explain danger signs and send home Explanation: The clinical scenario involves a 9-month-old child with fever and cough but without severe symptoms like chest indrawing, which would indicate severe pneumonia. The child's respiratory rate (RR) is 48 breaths per minute, which is normal for this age (RR >60/min would be abnormal for infants). According to the IMNCI guidelines, pneumonia is suspected if: RR >60 breaths/min for infants <2 months RR >50 breaths/min for infants 2-12 months RR >40 breaths/min for children 12 months to 6 years Lower chest wall indrawing, a sign of moderate pneumonia, is absent here. Severe pneumonia involves danger signs like lethargy, inability to drink, persistent vomiting, and convulsions, which are not present in this case. Based on this assessment, the child does not have severe pneumonia. The next step is to explain the danger signs to the caregiver and send the child home with appropriate follow-up instructions. Pneumonia Etiology Respiratory Syncytial Virus (RSV): Leading viral cause of pneumonia in infants. Streptococcus pneumoniae: M/c bacterial cause in children, particularly aged 1-3 months. Pneumocystis jirovecii: Common in HIV-infected infants, especially where ART and PCP prophylaxis are limited. Other Bacteria: E. coli, Gram-negative bacilli, Haemophilus influenzae, Group B streptococcus. Other Viruses: Rhinoviruses, parainfluenza, influenza, human metapneumovirus, adenovirus. Other Fungal: Histoplasma, Aspergillus, Blastomyces, Cryptococcus, mucormycosis, Coccidioides. Parasitic: Ascaris, Strongyloides. Mycobacterium: Mycobacterium tuberculosis, Mycobacterium avium complex. Assessment and Classification of the Sick Child (Age 2 Months Up to 5 Years) Initial Assessment: A thorough history from the mother is essential Check for General Danger Signs: Ask Look Action Able to drink or breastfeed? Does the child vomit everything? H/O convulsions during this illness? Lethargic or unconscious? Currently convulsing? If any danger signs are present, the child needs URGENT attention. Assess Cough or Difficulty Breathing Ask: How long has the child had a cough or difficulty breathing? Look, Listen, Feel: Count the breaths per minute (use respiratory rate timers if available). Fast Breathing Criteria: Age 2 months up to 12 months: ≥ 50 breaths per minute. Age 12 months up to 5 years: ≥ 40 breaths per minute. Look for: Chest in-drawing. Stridor, wheeze. Central cyanosis. Oxygen saturation. Use the AVPU scale (Alert, Voice, Pain, Unresponsive). Assess for possible asthma/TB if the child has wheezing with chest in-drawing or fast breathing. Classification of Pneumonia and Management Classification Signs Treatment Severe Pneumonia or Very Severe Disease Any general danger sign Oxygen saturation < 90% Stridor in calm child Central cyanosis Convulsions AVPU = V, P, or U Start oxygen therapy if saturation < 90%. Administer Benzyl Penicillin (or Ampicillin) & Gentamicin. Ceftriaxone should be used as a second-line treatment in children with severe pneumonia having failed on the first-line treatment. Give diazepam if convulsing. Prevent hypoglycemia. Treat wheeze if present. Urgent referral or admission. Pneumonia Chest indrawing in calm child",

      "explanation": "Correct Answer: B) i and iv Explanation: Cystic fibrosis (CF) is an autosomal recessive disorder caused by mutations in the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) gene. The CFTR protein regulates chloride channels in various organs, including the sweat glands and the pancreas, which leads to the clinical features observed in CF. Increased chloride in sweat (i): In CF, the CFTR defect leads to impaired chloride reabsorption in sweat glands. This results in abnormally high chloride levels in sweat, which is used as a diagnostic test for CF (sweat chloride test). A sweat chloride level >80 mmol/L is diagnostic of CF. Decreased chloride in pancreatic juice (iv): In CF, the CFTR defect also impairs chloride secretion in the pancreas. This results in thick and adherent exocrine secretions that obstruct pancreatic ducts, impair enzyme production, and lead to malabsorption and steatorrhea. Cystic fibrosis Genetic Basis Gene: CFTR (Cystic Fibrosis Transmembrane Conductance Regulator) Location: Chromosome 7q31.2 Common Mutation: ∆ F508 Inheritance: Autosomal recessive Pathophysiology CFTR Dysfunction: Defective chloride transport, increased sodium absorption, dehydrated mucus Metabolic: (Hypokalemia) Due to excessive loss of potassium through sweat and impaired renal potassium handling Respiratory: Airway obstruction, bacterial colonization, bronchiectasis, respiratory failure Gastrointestinal: Pancreatic duct obstruction, malabsorption, Distal Intestinal Obstruction Syndrome Sweat Glands: Salty sweat Reproductive: Infertility in males: Congenital absence of the vas deferens in males leading to azoospermia and infertility. Infertility in females: Defective CFTR in the cervix leads to the production of thick, dehydrated cervical mucus that blocks the cervical os, impairing sperm entry and reducing fertility. Clinical Features Respiratory: Chronic productive cough, recurrent infections, bronchiectasis Gastrointestinal: Steatorrhea, malabsorption, meconium ileus, failure to thrive Genitourinary: Infertility (males), delayed puberty Other: Digital clubbing, salt-loss syndromes (Contraction alkalosis) Diagnosis Diagnostic Criteria Requirement 1: Any ONE of the following Clinical Features: Presence of typical features Family History: A sibling with diagnosed cystic fibrosis Newborn Screening: Positive result indicating risk for CF IRT Screening: Elevated Immunoreactive Trypsinogen (IRT) for pancreatic insufficiency Requirement 2: At least ONE of the following Laboratory Evidence: Sweat Chloride Test: Two elevated sweat chloride concentrations on separate days ≥ 60 mMol/L (Pilocarpine iontophoresis method) CFTR Mutations: Identification of two CFTR mutations Nasal Potential Difference: Abnormal measurement Microbes <18 years: Staphylococcus aureus >18 years: Pseudomonas aeruginosa Burkholderia cepacia: High mortality, low incidence Management Strategies Airway Clearance: Chest physiotherapy, percussion, postural drainage Infection Control: Antibiotics, CFTR modulators Nutritional Support: High-calorie diet, PERT, vitamin supplementation (A, D, E, K) Other: Insulin for CFRD, bone health management Advanced Therapies CFTR Modulators: Ivacaftor, lumacaftor, Trikafta Trikafta: Elexacaftor-Tezacaftor-Ivacaftor ( ≥ 2 years old), improves lung function, reduces sweat chloride",

It often presents with recurrent respiratory infections and tachypnea due to the compromised lung tissue. The recurrent chest infections and tachypnea are consistent with CCAM, as the cystic lesions in the lung can lead to chronic respiratory problems and increased susceptibility to infections. Incorrect Options: Option B - Right-sided Congenital Diaphragmatic Hernia (CDH): CDH occurs when there is a defect in the diaphragm that allows abdominal organs to move into the chest cavity, impairing lung development and function. It often presents with respiratory distress shortly after birth. Although CDH can cause tachypnea and respiratory distress, it typically presents more acutely and may be associated with other signs such as mediastinal shift or absence of breath sounds on the affected side. Recurrent chest infections are less characteristic. Option C - Congenital Lobar Emphysema: This condition involves overinflation of a lobe of the lung, which can compress adjacent lung tissue and cause respiratory distress. It usually presents with respiratory symptoms in the newborn period but is less commonly associated with recurrent infections. While congenital lobar emphysema can cause tachypnea and respiratory issues, recurrent chest infections are not a typical feature. The clinical presentation is less consistent",

        "D": "Observation"
      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: B) Give 100% O2 Explanation: In this scenario, the child developed the symptoms after 4 days of birth, and the aetiology can be cardiac (cyanotic heart disease) or pulmonary. Hence, the best method is to give 100% oxygen to the neonate to distinguish the cause. If the saturation improves, the cause is respiratory, and if not, the cause is cardiogenic. This is called the hyperoxia test. Hyperoxia test for distinguishing CCHD from pulmonary disease This is the initial method to differentiate congenital critical heart disease (CCHD) from pulmonary disease. Procedure: Measure arterial blood gases (ABG) first at room air and then again after administering 100% oxygen for 10 minutes. Expected results in CCHD: Neonates with CCHD usually fail to increase PaO2 above 100 mm Hg with 100% oxygen. Expected Results in Pulmonary Disease: In pulmonary disease, PaO2 typically increases to ≥ 100 mm Hg when given 100% oxygen, as ventilation-perfusion mismatch is corrected. Interpretation: A positive result (failure to increase PaO2) suggests a cardiac origin, warranting further cardiac evaluation to rule out CCHD.

Assessment and Classification of the Sick Child (Age 2 Months Up to 5 Years) Initial Assessment: A thorough history from the mother is essential Check for General Danger Signs: Ask Look Action Able to drink or breastfeed? Does the child vomit everything? H/O convulsions during this illness? Lethargic or unconscious? Currently convulsing? If any danger signs are present, the child needs URGENT attention. Assess Cough or Difficulty Breathing: Ask: How long has the child had a cough or difficulty breathing? Look, Listen, Feel: Count the breaths in one minute (use respiratory rate timers if available). Fast Breathing Criteria: Age 2 months up to 12 months: Fast breathing is 50 breaths per minute or more. Age 12 months up to 5 years: Fast breathing is 40 breaths per minute or more. Look for chest indrawing Look and listen for stridor, wheeze Check for central cyanosis Check oxygen saturation Check the AVPU scale (Alert, Voice, Pain, Unresponsive) Assess for possible asthma/TB if wheezing with chest in-drawing or fast breathing is present. Classify the condition: Classification Signs Treatment Severe Pneumonia or Very Severe Disease (Option C) Any general danger sign OR Oxygen saturation <90% Stridor in calm child Central cyanosis Convulsions AVPU = V, P, or U Start oxygen therapy if saturation < 90%.

A ratio greater than 2.5 indicates that the fetus has mature lungs and is capable of producing sufficient surfactant. Option B: Positive shake test: The shake test, also known as the foam stability test or bubble stability test, is another method used to assess fetal lung maturity. In this test, amniotic fluid is shaken vigorously, and the presence of stable foam indicates the presence of surfactant, suggesting lung maturity.

      "explanation": "Correct Answer D - Hypophosphatemic rickets The patient’s presentation with rachitic changes in limbs since the age of 2 and receiving multiple courses of vitamin D with a normal calcium level and a low phosphate level is suggestive of hypophosphatemic rickets. Hypophosphatemic rickets is a genetic disorder characterized by impaired renal tubular reabsorption of phosphate, resulting in low levels of serum phosphate (hypophosphatemia). This leads to defective bone mineralization, resulting in rachitic changes in the bones.

However, in this case, the PTH is normal, which is not consistent with vitamin D-dependent rickets, where PTH levels are typically high. Hypoparathyroidism (Option B) is characterized by low levels of parathyroid hormone (PTH) leading to low calcium levels and high phosphate levels. However, in the given scenario, the PTH level is within normal limits, ruling out hypoparathyroidism. Chronic renal failure (Option C) can cause renal tubular dysfunction, leading to electrolyte imbalances and bone abnormalities. However, in the given scenario, the serum electrolytes and creatinine levels are within normal limits, indicating normal renal function.

      "question": "What is the diagnosis for a 4-year-old boy who has muscle weakness, difficulty climbing stairs, and getting up from the floor, with a muscle biopsy showing small muscle fibrils and absence of dystrophin?",
      "options": {
        "A": "Becker muscle dystrophy",
        "B": "Duchenne muscular dystrophy",
        "C": "Myotonic dystrophy",
        "D": "Limb-girdle muscular dystrophy"
      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: B) Duchenne muscular dystrophy Explanation: Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) is a genetic disorder characterized by progressive muscle degeneration and weakness. It is caused by mutations in the DMD gene that encodes the protein dystrophin. Symptoms: Children with DMD typically show signs of muscle weakness, difficulty climbing stairs, and getting up from the floor . Diagnosis: The clinical presentation, along with the muscle biopsy showing absence of dystrophin, confirms the diagnosis of Duchenne muscular dystrophy. Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy (DMD) vs Becker Muscular Dystrophy (BMD) : Aspect Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy (DMD) Becker Muscular Dystrophy (BMD) Type of Mutation Frameshift mutations leading to a disrupted reading frame In frame mutations that preserve the reading frame Dystrophin Protein Dystrophin deficient Truncated and unstable (< 3% of normal) Abnormal dystrophin Partially functional (20–90% of normal) Inheritance Pattern X-linked recessive Age of onset Early childhood (Before 5 years) Later childhood (After 5-7 years) Clinical Severity Severe, early onset, rapid progression Milder, later onset, slower progression Nonambulatory by 9-10.5 years of age > 15 years of age Additional Symptoms Early onset of myalgia, rhabdomyolysis, and respiratory distress None or milder Becker Muscular Dystrophy (Option A) is also caused by mutations in the DMD gene but typically results in partially functional dystrophin. Symptoms are similar to DMD but milder and with later onset. Muscle biopsy would show reduced but not absent dystrophin. Myotonic dystrophy (Option C) is a different genetic disorder caused by mutations in the DMPK or CNBP genes. It involves myotonia (difficulty relaxing muscles), cataracts, and cardiac abnormalities and muscle biopsy would not show absence of dystrophin. Limb-girdle muscular dystrophy (LGMD) (Option D) involves a group of disorders affecting the voluntary muscles, particularly around the hips and shoulders. It typically shows a different pattern of muscle involvement and genetic mutations, and muscle biopsy would not show the absence of dystrophin but might show other abnormalities.

        "D": "Excretion of phosphorus is decreased"
      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: B) PHEX gene is affected Explanation: X-linked hypophosphatemic rickets (XLH) is characterized by mutations in the PHEX gene. This gene encodes the phosphate-regulating endopeptidase homolog X-linked (PHEX) protein , which plays a crucial role in phosphate homeostasis. When the PHEX gene is mutated, it leads to increased FGF-23 levels , resulting in impaired phosphate reabsorption in the renal tubules and subsequent hypophosphatemia. XLH is inherited in an X-linked dominant pattern and presents with characteristic features including lower limb deformities, dental abnormalities, and skeletal manifestations without typical hypocalcemic symptoms. X-Linked Hypophosphatemic (XLH) Rickets Prevalence 1 in 20,000. Most common among genetic disorders causing rickets Inheritance X-linked dominant Gene Mutated PHEX (phosphate-regulating gene with homology to endopeptidases on X chromosome) Normally, product of this gene appears to have an indirect role in inactivating FGF-23 Pathophysiology Clinical Manifestations Lower limb deformities: Coxa vara Genu valgum Genu varum Poor growth Maxillofacial abnormalities Skull deformities: Due to premature fusion of cranial sutures Delayed dentition Short stature Laboratory Findings High renal phosphate excretion Hypophosphatemia Elevated alkaline phosphatase (ALP) Normal PTH and serum calcium Low or inappropriately normal levels of 1,25-D Treatment Phosphorus Supplementation: 1-3 g elemental phosphorus daily, divided into 4-5 doses Can be given in the form of Joulie solution (30.4 mg phosphate/mL) or as neutral phosphate effervescent tablets Frequent dosing helps to prevent prolonged decrements in serum phosphorus because there is rapid decline after each dose Calcitriol: 30-70 ng/kg/day in 2 doses Burosumab-twza: Monoclonal antibody targeting FGF-23, an alternative for children >1 year Prognosis Generally good response to therapy, though frequent dosing can affect compliance FGF-23 levels decreased (Option A) : This is incorrect because XLH is characterized by elevated levels of FGF-23, not decreased levels. The increased FGF-23 leads to phosphate wasting and decreased active vitamin D production, which are hallmark features of the condition. It is the most common cause of rickets (Option C) : This statement is incorrect because while XLH is the most common inherited form of rickets, nutritional deficiencies, particularly vitamin D deficiency, remain the most common overall cause of rickets worldwide. Excretion of phosphorus is decreased (Option D) : This statement contradicts the pathophysiology of XLH, where there is increased renal phosphate wasting leading to elevated urinary phosphorus excretion. This increased phosphate excretion is a direct result of elevated FGF-23 levels and is a key diagnostic feature of the condition.",

      "explanation": "Correct Answer: B) Rickets Explanation: The radiographical features such as widened or irregular growth plates in the phalanges and metacarpals & metaphyses near the growth plates showing a cupped or flared appearance indicate the diagnosis of Rickets. Rickets is a condition that primarily affects growing children and is caused by a deficiency in vitamin D, calcium, or phosphate. Radiological Changes: Decreased Calcification: Leads to the thickening of the growth plate. Fraying: Initial change is the loss of the normal zone of provisional calcification adjacent to the metaphysis, which appears as a blurring or frayed appearance of the metaphyseal margin. Cupping: Edge of the metaphysis changes from a convex or flat surface to a more concave surface, particularly noticeable at the distal ends of the radius, ulna, and fibula. Splaying: Cartilage hypertrophy leads to the widening of the growth plate resulting in the widening (splaying) of the metaphyseal ends. Generalized reduction in bone density: Osteopenia Widening of the Metaphysis Scurvy (Option A): Shows different radiological features, including ground-glass appearance and Wimberger's ring sign. Osteomalacia (Option C): Similar to rickets but occurs in adults and radiographically suggests growth plate closure. Osteopetrosis (Option D): Shows increased bone density rather than the decreased density seen here.",

      },
      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: C) Osteogenesis imperfecta Explanation: The clinical manifestations indicate Osteogenesis Imperfecta (OI) based on the classic triad of repeated fractures, blue sclera, and dental abnormalities , along with a positive family history. Osteogenesis imperfecta (OI): It is caused by mutations in the genes responsible for producing type I collagen , which is the primary component of the bone matrix. This defective collagen synthesis leads to brittle bones, resulting in frequent fractures from minimal trauma. Additional clinical features like blue sclerae, hearing loss, and joint hypermobility are also seen in OI. Features of Osteogenesis Imperfecta: Pathophysiology Defective type I collagen synthesis Genetic Mutations Type I-IV: COL1A1, COL1A2 Type V: IFITM5 Type VI: SERPINF1 Key Clinical Features Recurrent fractures from minimal trauma, blue sclerae, hearing loss, joint hypermobility, osteopenia Complications Cardiopulmonary issues (pneumonia, cor pulmonale), neurological complications (basilar invagination, brainstem compression) Differential Diagnosis Rickets, osteopetrosis, and disorders related to abnormal calcium metabolism Treatment Physical rehabilitation, Bisphosphonates, growth hormone, orthopedic management (fracture care, surgery) Scurvy (Option A) is a vitamin C deficiency disorder characterized by weakness, fatigue, joint pain, easy bruising, and poor wound healing. While it can cause bone abnormalities, it does not present with blue sclera or repeated fractures. Rickets (Option B) results in impaired bone mineralization and skeletal deformities due to vitamin D deficiency or metabolism disorders, but does not present with blue sclera and dental abnormalities. Osteomalacia (Option D) is characterized by softening of bones due to impaired mineralization caused by vitamin D deficiency in adults. However it does not present with repeated fractures in children. Reference: Nelson Textbook of Pediatrics Edition 21, Page no: 3736, 3737",
