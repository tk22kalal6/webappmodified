      },
      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: A) ACTH Explanation: The given clinical scenario with infantile seizures, developmental delays, and EEG abnormalities points towards West syndrome. ACTH is the first-line treatment for West Syndrome , as it is effective in managing infantile spasms and normalising EEG abnormalities. West Syndrome Age group Typically occurs between 2 and 12 months of age. Genetics ARX Gene Mutations : In males, linked to ambiguous genitalia and cortical migration abnormalities. Types Cryptogenic (Unknown Etiology) : Normal development before onset. Symptomatic : Associated with developmental delays due to perinatal issues, brain malformations, metabolic disorders, or other causes. Clinical Features Infantile Epileptic Spasms : Clusters of spasms occurring mainly during drowsiness or upon waking. Developmental Regression Hypsarrhythmia on EEG : A chaotic, high-voltage background with multifocal spikes. Management First-Line Treatment : Hormonal therapy, primarily ACTH (80 mg/mL) Dosage : 150 units/m² daily (75 units/m² twice daily) for 2 weeks, then taper gradually. Monitoring : EEGs at 1, 2, and 4 weeks to assess response. Early intervention is crucial, as a delay beyond 3 weeks can worsen the prognosis. Alternative Treatments Oral Prednisolone : Lower-cost alternative (Less effective) Vigabatrin (Option B) : Used as a first-line agent in West syndrome associated with tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) or second-line if hormonal therapy fails . Side effects include retinal toxicity. Ketogenic Diet : Considered a third-line therapy.pyridoxine Other Medications : Valproate, benzodiazepines (nitrazepam, clonazepam), topiramate (Option D) , lamotrigine, zonisamide, pyridoxine, and IVIG. These drugs can help reduce seizure frequency and severity but are not uniformly effective and may be used alongside ACTH or vigabatrin in cases with incomplete response. Side Effects and Precautions Side Effects of Hormonal Therapy : Hypertension, electrolyte imbalance, infections, hyperglycemia, and gastric ulcers. Vaccination : Live vaccines are contraindicated, and other vaccines may be ineffective during and shortly after hormonal therapy. Gabapentin (Option D) is an anticonvulsant commonly used for neuropathic pain and partial seizures but is ineffective for infantile spasms.

        "D": "Advise only antipyretic use during febrile illnesses"
      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: B) Prescribe intermittent oral clobazam during febrile illnesses Explanation: Intermittent oral diazepam is appropriate for children with frequent febrile seizures ( ≥ 3 in 6 months or ≥ 4 in one year). It balances seizure prevention with avoiding continuous medication. The dose is 0.8-1 mg/kg/day in 2 divided doses and should be started at the first sign of any fever and continued for the first 48 hours. For high-risk cases, start intermittent oral diazepam at the first sign of fever and continue for 3 days to manage seizure risk effectively without continuous medication. Prevention of Recurrent Febrile Seizures: Category Intermittent Prophylaxis Continuous Prophylaxis Usage Medications used during periods of fever to prevent seizures and are not used continuously. Regular, ongoing use of antiepileptic drugs to prevent seizures regardless of fever. Indications Frequent recurrences ( ≥ 3 in 6 months or ≥ 4 in one year); High parental anxiety Complex febrile seizures (focal, prolonged) Recurrences despite intermittent prophylaxis Neurological or developmental issues Family history of epilepsy Medications Used Oral Diazepam Rectal Diazepam Oral Clobazam Antipyretics (acetaminophen, ibuprofen) Valproic Acid (Option C) Phenobarbital (Option A) Dosage Diazepam (Oral, rectal) Clobazam Antipyretics (for fever control) Valproic Acid Phenobarbital Advise only antipyretic use during febrile illnesses (Option D): Antipyretics manage fever but do not prevent febrile seizures, making them insufficient for seizure prevention in this child's case.

        "D": "Perform a lumbar puncture to rule out infection"
      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: B) Oral antipyretics and reassurance Explanation: For a child presenting with febrile seizures lasting <5 minutes and no neurological symptoms, the primary management is to administer oral antipyretics (e.g., acetaminophen or ibuprofen) and provide reassurance , as these seizures are typically self-limiting and not indicative of a serious underlying condition. Management of Febrile Seizures: Initial Assessment : Most febrile seizures resolve spontaneously. If the seizure has ended and the child is returning to baseline, active treatment with benzodiazepines is not needed. Use antipyretics to manage fever. Seizures lasting >5 Minutes: Administer intravenous benzodiazepines (diazepam 0.1 to 0.2 mg/kg or lorazepam 0.05 to 0.1 mg/kg) if the seizure persists, with additional doses as needed. Monitoring: Closely monitor respiratory and circulatory status. Prepare for advanced airway management if ventilation is compromised. Administer high-dose steroids (Option A): Not used for simple febrile seizures. Steroids are reserved for specific conditions like severe inflammatory or autoimmune disorders. Start intravenous antiepileptics (Option C): Reserved for seizures lasting for >5 minutes or if the seizure is prolonged and does not stop spontaneously. Perform a lumbar puncture to rule out infection (Option D): It is considered only if there are signs of meningitis or infection.

      "explanation": "Correct Answer: B) Simple febrile seizure Explanation: The given scenario is consistent with simple febrile seizures characterised by a short duration (less than 15 minutes), a single generalised tonic-clonic episode, and normal neurological development. Criteria for Diagnosis of Simple Febrile Seizure: Age: 6-60 months (peak incidence at 12-18 months). Fever: Associated with a temperature ≥ 38°C (100.4°F). Seizure Characteristics: Generalized, usually tonic-clonic. Duration: Seizure lasts ≤ 15 minutes. Recurrence: No recurrence within 24 hours. Postictal State: Rapid return to baseline consciousness without neurological deficit. Exclusion of Other Causes: No signs of CNS infection, metabolic imbalance, or history of afebrile seizures. Risk factors for febrile seizures: Genetic predisposition (family history) Age (peak 12-18 months) The rapid rise in body temperature Meningitis (Option A) often present with signs such as neck stiffness, photophobia, or altered mental status. The child's rapid return to baseline and absence of additional symptoms from the given scenario are not consistent with meningitis. Simple Febrile Seizure (Option B) Complex Febrile Seizure (Option C) Febrile Status Epilepticus (Option C) Generalised tonic-clonic seizure. Lasts ≤ 15 minutes. No recurrence within 24 hours.

Vein of Galen Malformation: Congenital arteriovenous malformation (AVM) in the brain, in which the median prosencephalic vei n forms an abnormal connection with multiple feeding arteries, causing direct high-flow shunting of arterial blood into the venous system. This results in a significant dilation of the Vein of Galen, leading to hydrocephalus, cardiac failure, and other complications due to excessive volume and pressure overload. Management: Medical Management: Symptomatic treatment for heart failure and hydrocephalus. Interventional Treatment: Endovascular Embolization is the primary treatment approach is to occlude abnormal vessels and reduce blood flow to the malformation.",

It is implanted surgically to divert excess cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) from the ventricles of the brain to the peritoneal cavity, where it can be absorbed by the body. Management of Hydrocephalus: Medical : Acetazolamide and furosemide can temporarily reduce CSF production but are not effective long-term. (Option A, D) Surgical: (CSF Diversion) Ventriculoperitoneal Shunt: Valved tubing from the ventricle to the peritoneal cavity. Endoscopic Third Ventriculostomy: It is a useful treatment for certain cases of hydrocephalus, especially when there is an obstructive pattern that can be bypassed surgically and not always suitable for all patients and is considered an alternative to shunt placement (Option B) Intrauterine Treatment : Results are generally poor except in cases associated with fetal meningomyelocele.

      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: A) Aqueductal stenosis Explanation: Aqueductal stenosis is a common congenital cause of obstructive hydrocephalus in infants , leading to increased head circumference and elevated intracranial pressure. The upward gaze palsy, due to pressure on the quadrigeminal plate, and the finding of enlarged ventricles on ultrasound are indicative of this condition. Hydrocephalus: Hydrocephalus is the abnormal accumulation of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) in the brain, leading to increased intracranial pressure and, in infants before sutural fusion, an enlarged head. In normal conditions, the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) production rate is approximately 20 mL per hour, with a volume of about 50 mL in infants and 150 mL in adults. Types of Hydrocephalus: Obstructive / Non-Communicating Non-Obstructive / Communicating Blockage in the ventricular system. Excess production or defective absorption of CSF due to non-obstructive causes. (Choroid plexus papilloma, meningeal malignancies) Causes: Congenital Acquired Aqueductal stenosis (Most Common) Dandy-Walker malformation Arnold-Chiari II malformation Intrauterine infections (e.g., toxoplasmosis, rubella) Malformation of the vein of Galen Intraventricular hemorrhage Meningitis (bacterial, tuberculous, mumps) Tumours (especially in the posterior fossa) Posterior fossa subdural collection Clinical Features: Before Sutural Fusion: Increased head size, bulging anterior fontanel, dilated scalp veins, irritability, lethargy, and poor appetite. After Sutural Fusion: Symptoms of raised intracranial pressure Signs: MacEwen Sign: \"Crackpot\" sound on skull percussion indicates sutural separation.

        "D": "4 mg daily, starting 1 month before conception"
      },
      "correct_answer": "D",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: D) 4 mg daily, starting 1 month before conception Explanation: For women with a previous child affected by an NTD , the recommended folic acid supplementation is 4 mg daily, beginning at least 1 month before conception . This higher dose is crucial for reducing the risk of recurrence in future pregnancies. Neural Tube Defects: NTDs are the most common congenital CNS anomalies caused by the failure of the neural tube to close between the 3rd and 4th weeks of development. Risk Factors: Hyperthermia, drugs like Valproic acid, Trimethoprim and anticonvulsants (carbamazepine, phenytoin, phenobarbital), malnutrition, low folate levels, chemicals, maternal obesity, diabetes, and radiation exposure before conception. Detection and Screening: Biochemical Markers: Elevated α -fetoprotein (AFP) and acetylcholinesterase in amniotic fluid indicate NTDs. Prevention: Ideal Range: Red blood cell folate levels of 900-1,000 nmol/L are associated with a reduced risk of NTDs.

      "question": "A 25-year-old pregnant woman undergoes routine prenatal screening during her 16th week of pregnancy. The serum alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) level is found to be elevated. This finding suggests the presence of which of the following conditions?",
      "options": {
        "A": "Spina Bifida",
        "B": "Down Syndrome",
        "C": "Trisomy 18",
        "D": "Cystic Fibrosis"
      },
      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: A) Spina Bifida Explanation: The elevation of AFP in maternal serum is a significant marker for neural tube defects such as spina bifida. In contrast, conditions like Down syndrome and trisomy 18 are associated with lower AFP levels, and cystic fibrosis is not typically detected through AFP levels. Markers of Neural tube defects Alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) Elevated levels in maternal serum and amniotic fluid can indicate the presence of an NTD, as fetal substances leak into the amniotic fluid due to neural tube openings. AFP is commonly measured during the 16th-18th weeks of pregnancy. Acetylcholinesterase Elevated levels in amniotic fluid can be a marker for NTDs, as it may be released into the amniotic fluid when there is a neural tube defect. Ultrasound Findings Directly visualises NTDs such as spina bifida, anencephaly, and encephalocele. Specific signs like the \"lemon sign\" and \"banana sign\" can suggest certain types of NTDs. A lemon sign indicates a flattened frontal bone often seen in spina bifida. Banana signs show a specific appearance (elongation and downward displacement) of the cerebellum, as seen in spina bifida.",

      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: A) Aicardi Syndrome Explanation: The given scenario is more indicative of Aicardi syndrome characterised by agenesis of the corpus callosum, distinctive retinal lesions (chorioretinal lacunae), and developmental issues, including infantile spasms. Aicardi Syndrome Definition A complex disorder affecting multiple body systems, often involving the brain, eyes, and other organs. Genetics It is an X-linked dominant condition predominantly seen in females since males with a mutation on their single X chromosome are typically non-viable during fetal life. Characteristic features Agenesis of the Corpus Callosum : Complete or partial absence of the corpus callosum, affecting communication between brain hemispheres. Distinctive Chorioretinal Lacunae : Well-defined white or yellowish spots on the retina. Infantile Spasms : Seizures beginning in infancy characterised by sudden, brief muscle contractions. Clinical Presentation Seizures : Infantile spasms are common and often resistant to anticonvulsant medications. EEG Abnormalities : Independent activity in both hemispheres and a pattern called hemi hypsarrhythmia. Severe Intellectual Disability : Significant cognitive and adaptive limitations. Vertebral Abnormalities : Issues such as fused or hemivertebrae. Retinal Abnormalities : Additional abnormalities like coloboma of the optic disc. Tuberous Sclerosis Complex (Option B) is an autosomal dominant disorder characterized by a range of symptoms including cns manifestations like seizures (often epileptic spasms), and skin manifestations such a s ash leaf macules. Brain imaging may reveal subependymal nodules on CT and cortical tubers on MRI. Sturge Weber Syndrome (Option C) is characterized by a facial nevus or ' port wine stain ' in the distribution of the first branch of the trigeminal nerve, along with ipsilateral 'railroad pattern' intracranial calcifications and glaucoma. West Syndrome (Option D) is the most common epileptic encephalopathy in infancy, characterized by a triad of symptoms: infantile epileptic spasms (commonly occur in clusters), developmental regression, and a distinctive EEG pattern known as hypsarrhythmia (high voltage chaotic multifocal spike waves).",

      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: A) Lissencephaly Explanation: Lissencephaly is characterised by a smooth brain surface caused by the absence of normal gyri and sulci, and hourglass appearance due to narrowing of sylvian fissur e, resulting from abnormal neuronal migration during brain development. Neuronal migration disorders Disorder Radiological features Clinical Features Lissencephaly Smooth brain surface due to the absence of normal folds (gyri) and grooves (sulci). Narrowed sylvian fissures leading to hourglass or figure of 8 appearance . Severe developmental delays, intellectual disability, seizures, motor impairments. Polymicrogyria (Option D) Excessive number of small, abnormally formed convolutions (gyri) on the brain surface. The brain surface appears lumpy or irregular rather than smooth. Developmental delays, seizures, motor problems, cognitive impairments. Schizencephaly (Option B) Presence of clefts or slits within the brain, often connecting ventricles to the brain's surface. Developmental delays, seizures, motor abnormalities, potential hydrocephalus. Heterotopia Abnormal presence of grey matter (normally on the brain's surface) in abnormal locations, such as within white matter Seizures, developmental delays, motor impairments. Holoprosencephaly (Option C) is a condition where the forebrain fails to split into two hemispheres, leading to various brain malformations and facial abnormalities.",

      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: B) Iniencephaly Explanation: Iniencephaly is a rare and severe neural tube defect characterised by extreme retroflexion of the head (hyperextension) and severe defects in the spine, particularly the cervical vertebrae and occipital bone. Clinical Features: Hyperextension of the head ( \"Stargazer posture\" ), short and deformed spine, often incompatible with life. It is diagnosed prenatally through: Maternal Serum Screening: Elevated alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) levels may indicate a neural tube defect. Ultrasound: Confirms the diagnosis by revealing craniovertebral junction anomalies, including a malformed or absent occipital bone and associated brain and spine abnormalities. Anencephaly (Option A) is a severe neural tube defect characterized by the partial or complete absence of the brain and cranial vault, resulting from the failure of neural tube closure during early fetal development. During labor, it may present with face presentation or shoulder dystocia. Prenatal ultrasound shows the absence of the cranial vault, exposed brain tissue , and the \"frog eye sign,\" c haracterised by a flattened head with prominent, bulging orbits. Porencephaly (Option C) appears on ultrasound as cystic or cavitary lesions within the cerebral hemispheres but does not affect fetal posture or cause neck hyperextension. Encephalocele (Option D)",
