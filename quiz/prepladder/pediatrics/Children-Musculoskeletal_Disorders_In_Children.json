      },
      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: A) Methotrexate is used as it acts within a few days Explanation: Methotrexate is a disease-modifying anti-rheumatic agen t used to treat JIA, but it takes 6-12 weeks to work . Diagnosis: The steps in diagnosing JIA start with the clinical evaluation of the child. The symptoms, medical history, physical examinations, and exclusion of other conditions give a good grasp of the possible diagnosis. Investigations are the next step in diagnosis: Investigations Observations Laboratory tests CBC: Microcytic anemia Elevated platelets WBC Low platelets may indicate a macrophage activation system (MAS). ESR & CRP: Indicate inflammation Raised but could also be normal in children Falling ESR in systemic JIA can signal MAS ANA: Elevated in oligoarticular/polyarticular JIA Increases uveitis risk RF: Positive in 5-15% of polyarticular JIA cases Indicates a more severe disease. Anti-Cyclic Citrullinated Peptide Antibody: indicates a higher chance of severe disease. Ferritin: High in systemic JIA Dramatically elevated in MAS. Radiological findings X-rays: Soft tissue swelling Periarticular osteopenia Periosteal new-bone formation Sub-chondral erosions Loss of cartilage MRI: More sensitive for early joint damage, shows inflammation. Treatment of JIA: Treatment goals Achieve remission: minimal or no symptoms Prevent joint damage: early, aggressive treatment to minimize long-term damage Support growth: ensure normal bone growth and development Treatment NSAIDs: Reduce pain and inflammation Side effects include gastritis and toxicity Disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (DMARDs): Methotrexate is effective but may take 6-12 weeks (Option A) Side effects include nausea and liver toxicity Sulfasalazine & Leflunomide are alternatives for polyarticular JIA Biologics: Target-specific immune system components Includes TNF inhibitors(abatacept & tocilizumab) (Option B ruled out) Side effects are immunosuppression and injection site reactions IL-1 Inhibitors: Effective for systemic JIA Includes anakinra (Option C ruled out) and canakinumab",

      "explanation": "Correct Answer: C) Rickets Explanation: The given image shows rachitic rosary, which is a characteristic finding of rickets. Widening of the costochondral junction results in a rachitic rosary, which feels like a rosary bead as the examiner’s finger moves along the costochondral junctions from rib to rib. Clinical Features of Rickets: General: Failure to thrive (malnutrition) Listlessness Protruding abdomen Muscle weakness (especially proximal) Hypocalcemic dilated cardiomyopathy Fractures (pathologic, minimal trauma) Increased intracranial pressure Head: Craniotabes: Softening of cranial bones Frontal bossing Delayed fontanel closure (usually closed by 2 yr) Delayed dentition Craniosynostosis Hypocalcemic Symptoms: Tetany Seizures Stridor caused by laryngeal spasm Chest: Rachitic rosary: Due to widening of the costochondral junction Harrison groove: Horizontal depression along the lower anterior chest due to pulling of softened ribs by the diaphragm during inspiration Respiratory infections and atelectasis Back: Scoliosis Kyphosis Lordosis Extremities: Enlargement of wrists and ankles: Due to growth plate widening Valgus or varus deformities Windswept deformity (valgus deformity of one leg with varus deformity of other leg) Anterior bowing of tibia and femur Coxa vara Aspect Scorbutic Rosary (Option B) Rachitic Rosary (Option C) Underlying Deficiency Vitamin C deficiency (scurvy) leads to impaired collagen synthesis.

      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: A) Juvenile Myasthenia Gravis Explanation: Myasthenia Gravis is a chronic autoimmune disease of the neuromuscular junction (postsynaptic endplate) that leads to abnormal neuromuscular transmission or blockade. In children it is called Juvenile Myasthenia Gravis. Clinical features: Symptoms can show from the age of 11 months to 17 years Characteristic feature: rapid fatigue of muscles. Ocular symptoms: Asymmetric ptosis Progressive extraocular muscle weakness Diplopia Bulbar symptoms: Dysphagia Disarthria Facial weakness Limb weakness: Neckflexor weakness: difficulty holding the head up and poor head control. Arm weakness: weakness of limb girdle muscle and distal muscles of hands cause difficulty raising arms or performing tasks requiring strength. Other characteristics: Fluctuating weakness Normal reflexes Absence of sensory symptoms Complications: Respiratory muscle paralysis. Myasthenic crisis : acute or subacute increase in weakness caused by an infection, surgery or emotional stress. Treated by IV cholinesterase inhibitors , immunoglobulins , plasma exchange, gavage feeding and if needed transient ventilator support. Infants of a mother with MG can have transient neonatal myasthenia characterized by respiratory insufficiency , inability to suck or swallow, generalized hypotonia and weakness.

      "question": "A newborn presents with limbs that resemble the flippers of a seal without intermediate segments. The mother reports taking medication for anxiety during early pregnancy. What is the most likely cause of this condition?",
      "options": {
        "A": "Thalidomide exposure",

        "D": "Impaired blood flow to the limbs"
      },
      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: A) Thalidomide exposure Explanation: Phocomelia is a congenital defect in which the limbs lack intermediate segments. As a result, the hands or feet attach directly to the trunk, resembling seal flippers. Thalidomide , a drug historically used to treat anxiety and morning sickness , is known for its teratogenic effects that lead to this condition, particularly when taken during pregnancy. Vitamin D deficiency (Option B) leads to conditions like rickets , characterized by bone softening and deformities , but it does not result in the specific limb malformations seen in phocomelia. While genetic mutations (Option C) can cause various congenital anomalies, the distinct history of taking medication for anxiety (thalidomide use) is a key factor pointing specifically to phocomelia. Impaired blood flow to the developing limbs (Option D) can cause limb defects, but the unique presentation of phocomelia, along with the maternal history of thalidomide use, makes this less likely than thalidomide exposure.",

      "question": "A 5-year-old child presents with multiple fractures following minimal trauma, blue sclerae, and mild hearing loss. Physical examination reveals joint hypermobility, and radiographs show osteopenia with evidence of previous fractures. What is the most likely underlying pathophysiology?",
      "options": {
        "A": "Defective type I collagen synthesis",
        "B": "Deficiency of vitamin D",
        "C": "Impaired osteoclast function",
        "D": "Abnormal calcium metabolism"
      },
      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: A) Defective type I collagen synthesis Explanation: Osteogenesis Imperfecta (OI) is caused by mutations in the genes responsible for producing type I collagen , which is the primary component of the bone matrix. This defective collagen synthesis leads to brittle bones, resulting in frequent fractures from minimal trauma. Additional clinical features like blue sclerae, hearing loss, and joint hypermobility further support the diagnosis of OI. Features of Osteogenesis Imperfecta Pathophysiology Defective type I collagen synthesis Genetic Mutations Type I-IV: COL1A1, COL1A2 Type V: IFITM5 Type VI: SERPINF1 Key Clinical Features Recurrent fractures from minimal trauma, blue sclerae, hearing loss, joint hypermobility, osteopenia Complications Cardiopulmonary issues (pneumonia, cor pulmonale), neurological complications (basilar invagination, brainstem compression) Differential Diagnosis Rickets, osteopetrosis, and disorders related to abnormal calcium metabolism Treatment Physical rehabilitation, Bisphosphonates, growth hormone, orthopedic management (fracture care, surgery) Deficiency of vitamin D (Option B) typically leads to conditions like rickets or osteomalacia , characterized by bone pain, muscle weakness, and deformities like bowing of the legs. While vitamin D deficiency can cause osteopenia, it is not associated with the other features seen in this child, such as blue sclerae and hearing loss. Impaired osteoclast function (Option C) is seen in osteopetrosis , a condition characterized by overly dense but brittle bones that lead to fractures. Osteopetrosis is not associated with blue sclerae, hearing loss, or joint hypermobility, which distinguishes it from OI. Abnormal calcium metabolism (Option D) can result in conditions like hypercalcemia or hypocalcemia , which can affect muscle function and potentially lead to bone density changes. However, this does not explain the combination of blue sclerae, frequent fractures, and hearing loss seen in OI.",

      "question": "A 4-month-old infant presents with macrocephaly, hepatosplenomegaly, and recurrent fractures. The radiograph shows diffuse bone sclerosis and a “bone within bone” appearance. Which of the following is the most appropriate treatment to prevent the progression of this condition?",
      "options": {

        "C": "Bisphosphonate therapy",
        "D": "Physical therapy and fracture management"
      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: B) Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) Explanation: This infant’s features of macrocephaly, hepatosplenomegaly, and recurrent fractures , with a radiograph showing diffuse bone sclerosis and a “bone within bone” appearance, are consistent with autosomal recessive osteopetrosis aka marble bone disease . Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) is the most effective treatment for this severe disease. HSCT addresses the underlying osteoclast dysfunction due to failure of osteoclast to resorb bone, by replacing the defective bone marrow with healthy donor cells capable of normal bone resorption. It can prevent or reverse bone abnormalities if performed before irreversible complications, such as vision loss, develop. Autosomal Dominant Osteopetrosis, also known as Albers-Schönberg disease or Marble bone disease, is more common and less severe. It is generally asymptomatic and presents in childhood or adolescence with fractures, mild anemia, and sometimes cranial nerve dysfunction. Features of Osteopetrosis Aspect Severe Autosomal Recessive Osteopetrosis Mild Autosomal Dominant Osteopetrosis Incidence ~1/250,000 births ~1/20,000 births Genetic Mutations TCIRG1, CLCN7, OSTM1, SNX10, TNFSFR11A, TNFSF11, PLEKHM1 CLCN7 Onset Infancy Childhood or adolescence Clinical Features Macrocephaly, hepatosplenomegaly, vision/hearing loss, severe anemia, fractures Fractures, mild anemia, possible cranial nerve dysfunction, dental issues, osteomyelitis Radiographic Findings Diffuse bone sclerosis, \"bone within bone\" appearance Increased bone density, clubbed metaphyses, \"sandwich\" vertebrae Prognosis Often fatal in infancy, survivors may live into the 2nd decade with disabilities Generally good, may be asymptomatic or have mild symptoms Treatment HSCT, RANKL replacement, calcitriol, interferon- γ , supportive care Symptomatic management Vitamin D supplementation (Option A) is not sufficient to correct the underlying osteoclast dysfunction in osteopetrosis. While Vitamin D can help manage calcium levels, it does not address the genetic cause of the disease. Bisphosphonates (Option C) inhibit bone resorption and would further worsen the bone density issues in osteopetrosis. This treatment is not appropriate for a condition where the problem is already excessive bone density. Physical therapy and fracture management (Option D) are important for supportive care. They do not prevent the progression of the underlying disease. The root cause, osteoclast dysfunction, must be addressed with HSCT.",

      },
      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: C) Typically follows a Gastrointestinal or genitourinary infection Explanation: Reactive arthritis often follows a gastrointestinal or genitourinary infection , commonly occurring within 3 days to 6 weeks after the initial infection. The presentation of asymmetric arthritis of the lower extremities, dactylitis, and erythematous plaques 4 weeks after an episode of dysentery strongly suggests this diagnosis. Markers of inflammation such as ESR, CRP, and platelets are elevated in early disease. The classic triad of arthritis, urethritis, and conjunctivitis is not commonly seen in children.

      "explanation": "Correct Answer: C) PHEX Explanation: Clinical features like short stature and leg bowing with lab results of low serum phosphate, elevated alkaline phosphatase, increased urinary phosphate and genetic testing showing mutation on the X chromosome point towards a diagnosis of X-linked hypophosphatemic rickets. In X-linked hypophosphatemic rickets, the mutated gene is PHEX (a phosphate-regulating gene with homology to endopeptidases on the X chromosome). X-Linked Hypophosphatemic (XLH) Rickets Most common among genetic disorders causing rickets Prevalence 1 in 20,000 Inheritance X-linked dominant Gene Mutated PHEX (phosphate-regulating gene with homology to endopeptidases on X chromosome) Normally, product of this gene appears to have an indirect role in inactivating FGF-23 Pathophysiology Clinical Manifestations Lower limb deformities: Coxa vara Genu valgum Genu varum Poor growth Maxillofacial abnormalities Skull deformities: Due to premature fusion of cranial sutures Delayed dentition Short stature Laboratory Findings High renal phosphate excretion Hypophosphatemia Elevated alkaline phosphatase (ALP) Normal PTH and serum calcium Low or inappropriately normal levels of 1,25-D Treatment Phosphorus Supplementation: 1-3 g elemental phosphorus daily, divided into 4-5 doses Can be given in the form of Joulie solution (30.4 mg phosphate/mL) or as neutral phosphate effervescent tablets Frequent dosing helps to prevent prolonged decrements in serum phosphorus because there is rapid decline after each dose Calcitriol: 30-70 ng/kg/day in 2 doses Burosumab-twza: Monoclonal antibody targeting FGF-23, an alternative for children >1 year Prognosis Generally good response to therapy, though frequent dosing can affect compliance SLC34A3 (Option A) (Sodium-phosphate cotransporter gene) mutations are associated with hereditary hypophosphatemic ricket s, not with hypercalciuria, not with X-linked hypophosphatemic rickets. FGF23 (Option B): While FGF23 (Fibroblast growth factor-23) levels are elevated in X-linked hypophosphatemic rickets (XLH), the gene responsible for XLH is PHEX, not FGF23 itself. FGF23 mutation is seen in autosomal dominant hypophosphatemic rickets. DMP1 (Option C) (Dentin matrix protein 1) mutation causes autosomal recessive hypophosphatemic rickets, not X-linked hypophosphatemia.

Antenatally, decreased fetal movements may be noticed Early motor delays: lack of head control Characteristic muscle weakness and hypotonia Severe generalized weakness affecting both limbs and trunk Proximal predominance greater weakness in proximal muscles (legs>arms) Hypotonia: leading to a “ floppy appearance ” Frog-leg posture resting position with hips abducted and knees flexed Absent or diminished reflexes (areflexia/hyporeflexia) : Deep tendon reflexes are affected Tongue fasciculations are fine, rapid muscle twitches in the tongue Respiratory distress due to weakness in intercostal muscles leads to paradoxical breathing, a bell-shaped chest, a weak cough, and frequent respiratory infections. Feeding difficulties due to challenges in sucking and swallowing carry the risk of aspiration. Cognitive functions are preserved as the upper motor neurons are spared. Lack of eye muscle/ facial movements: Motor neurons of cranial nerves III, IV, and VI to the extraocular muscles and of the sacral spinal cord to the striated muscle of the urethral and anal sphincters are preserved, but progressive disease might lead to facial weakness later on. SMA Type 0 (Option A) presents with severe hypotonia, facial diplegia, joint contractures, and cardiac abnormalities, but frog leg posture is not seen.

Management of juvenile myasthenia gravis: Mild myasthenia gravis : Some patients may require no treatment. Cholinesterase-Inhibiting Drugs : Pyridostigmine bromide (Mestinon) : Dosage: 0.5 to 1 mg/kg per dose every 4 to 6 hours while awake with a maximum daily dose of 7 mg/kg/day. Overdose causes a cholinergic crisis with increased secretions, diarrhea, and cramping. Atropine (Option B) blocks the muscarinic effects but does not block the nicotinic effects that produce additional skeletal muscle weakness. Steroids: Long-term treatment with prednisone (Option A) may help as the disease is autoimmune. Thymectomy : Might provide a cure Most effective in those with high titers of anti-AChR antibodies and symptomatic for less than 2 years. Treatment of hypothyroidism removes an associated myasthenia.

      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Correct answer: B) Facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy Explanation: Based on the given scenario, the likely diagnosis is Facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy. Facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy: It is an autosomal dominant disease with genetic anticipation. The earliest and most severe asymmetrical weakness is in the facial and shoulder muscles (scapular winging shown in the image) . The mouth is rounded and appears puckered because of protruding lips. The inability to close the eye completely in sleep is a common expression of upper facial weakness . Flattening or concavity of deltoid contour seen with wasted biceps and triceps. Muscles of the hip and thighs also eventually atrophy, and Gower’s sign is seen . Hearing loss, retinal vasculopathy, lumbar lordosis, and kyphoscoliosis are associated complications.

      "correct_answer": "D",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: D) Myotonic dystrophy Explanation: The patient’s clinical features of a high-arched palate, an inverted V-shaped upper lip, and prominent facial muscle wasting, along with myotonia, indicate Myotonic dystrophy. This autosomal-dominant condition is marked by facial weakness and distal muscle wasting . It is caused by defects in CTG (mnemonic: C annot T erminate G rip (myotonia)) trinucleotide expansion on chromosome 19q13. Myotonia is a very slow relaxation of muscle after contraction. Features and Management of Myotonic Dystrophy Types Classic Type 1 (DM1): CTG expansion in the DMPK gene on chromosome 19q13.3 Type 2 (DM2): CCTG expansion in zinc finger protein 9 (ZNF9) gene on chromosome 3q21 Late form (DM3): Linked to locus 15q21-q24 Inheritance Autosomal dominant Systemic Involvement Multisystem disease affecting muscles, cardiac function, endocrine system, GI tract, CNS, and immune system Clinical Features Facial Features: Inverted-V upper lip, thin cheeks, scalloped temporalis, high-arched palate Muscle Wasting: Distal > proximal muscles; myotonia present after age 5 Cardiac: Heart block, arrhythmias, sudden death Endocrine: Hypothyroidism, adrenal insufficiency, diabetes, delayed puberty, testicular atrophy Ocular: Cataracts, abnormal visual evoked potentials Intellectual Impairment: Mild to moderate, with increased autism risk Congenital Form: Severe hypotonia, respiratory difficulties, high infant mortality if prolonged ventilation needed Laboratory Findings Serum CK: Normal or mildly elevated EMG: Myotonic pattern evident from school age Cardiac Evaluation: Annual ECG; ECHO every 2 years Endocrine and Immune: Regular monitoring of thyroid, adrenal function, glucose tolerance, and immunoglobulins Diagnosis Primary: DNA analysis for CTG/CTG repeat expansions Muscle Biopsy: Shows central nuclei, type I fiber atrophy; usually not required for diagnosis Treatment Physiotherapy/ Orthopedic: For contractures and to maintain function Myotonia Management: Drugs like mexiletine, phenytoin, carbamazepine Cardiac Care: Annual ECG, consider pacemaker or antiarrhythmics for arrhythmias Respiratory Care: BiPAP, cough assist device, incentive spirometry Anesthesia Precautions: Avoid succinylcholine, use modified induction and extubation Duchenne muscular dystrophy (Option A): The facial features present in this case are not seen . It presents with a positive Gowers' sign and hypertrophy of the calf muscles , progresses rapidly, and leads to loss of ambulation in the early teenage years. It is associated with",

      "question": "A 6-year-old boy with a history of progressive muscle weakness and elevated serum CK levels is being evaluated for Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy (DMD).

        "D": "Conducting an electromyography (EMG) to assess for myopathic changes"
      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: B) Performing a muscle biopsy with dystrophin immunohistochemistry suspicion remains high (e.g., based on elevated serum CK levels and clinical features), the next best step is to perform a muscle biopsy with dystrophin immunohistochemistry. This test helps differentiate between DMD and other myopathies by identifying dystrophin abnormalities, providing a definitive diagnosis. Diagnostic and Therapeutic Approach to Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy (DMD) Initial Genetic Evaluation Primary Testing: Deletion/duplication analysis of the dystrophin gene using dosage analysis. Next-generation sequencing (NGS) if initial testing is negative. Muscle Biopsy Indications: Used when genetic tests are inconclusive, especially if serum CK levels are elevated. Findings: Endomysial connective tissue proliferation, degenerating/regenerating myofibers, hypercontracted fibers, dystrophin abnormalities. Steroid Therapy Purpose: Slows muscle strength decline, prolongs ambulation, and may benefit scoliosis progression. Dosing: Prednisone (0.75 mg/kg/day) or deflazacort (0.9 mg/kg/day); various dosing protocols available. Advanced Therapeutic Options Exon Skipping Therapy: Eteplirsen for patients with mutations amenable to exon 51 skipping (~13% of DMD cases). Nonsense Mutation Therapy: Ataluren for patients with nonsense mutations (~10-15% of DMD cases). Cardiac Management First-line Agents: ACE inhibitors, ARBs, beta-blockers, aldosterone antagonists. Timing of Intervention: Initiated based on echocardiogram findings (LVEF < 55%) or earlier based on MRI changes. Pulmonary Management Infection Prevention: Prompt treatment of pulmonary infections, avoidance of contagious illnesses, routine vaccinations. Sleep-Disordered Breathing: Sleep studies, BiPAP therapy, use of cough assist devices, airway clearance support. Nutritional Management Adequate calcium and vitamin D intake, weight management to prevent obesity. Physiotherapy & Contracture Management Delays but may not prevent contractures; stretching, bracing, and cautious surgical interventions. Glucocorticoids (Option A) are essential in managing DMD, but initiating therapy without confirming the diagnosis through further testing (such as a muscle biopsy) is not recommended. Exon skipping therapy, such as Eteplirsen (Option C) , is specific to patients with certain dystrophin gene mutations (e.g., those amenable to exon 51 skipping). It should not be started based solely on clinical suspicion without confirming the genetic mutation. While electromyography (Option D) can show",

      "explanation": "Correct answer: A) Duchenne muscular dystrophy Explanations: The findings of positive Gower’s sign, hypertrophy of the calf muscle and elevated serum creatine kinase with a history of waddling gait and difficulty climbing stairs in a child <5 years of age are suggestive of Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD). DMD progresses rapidly and leads to loss of ambulation in the early teenage years. It is associated with cognitive impairment and a high incidence of cardiomyopathy and respiratory complications , which typically determine life expectancy. Clinical Differences Between DMD and BMD Features Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy (DMD) Becker Muscular Dystrophy (BMD) Age of Onset Before 5 years After 5-7 years Early Symptoms Hip girdle weakness, delayed walking, Gowers’ sign, lordotic posture, frequent falls Mild motor delay, later onset of weakness Ambulation Loss Typically between 10-14 years Late adolescence or adulthood Progression Rate Rapid Slower Muscle Involvement Proximal muscle weakness, calf pseudohypertrophy Calf pseudohypertrophy, less severe proximal weakness Cardiac Involvement Common, usually worsens after loss of ambulation Common, may appear earlier despite ambulation Cognitive Impairment Common (20-30% with IQ < 70), possible autism-like behavior, epilepsy Less common Respiratory Involvement Common, leading to frequent pulmonary infections, sleep apnea, and respiratory failure Less severe, but present in later stages Life Expectancy Late teens to 20s Into 40s and 50s Gower sign presents with any other condition associated with weakness of pelvic girdle or proximal muscles of lower extremities , such as: Becker muscular dystrophy Limb-girdle and other muscular dystrophies Proximal ascending pseudomyopathic diseases Spinal muscular atrophy Sarcoglycanopathy Polymyositis Discitis Juvenile idiopathic arthritis Becker Muscular Dystrophy (Option B): It can also have features of Duchenne muscular dystrophy, including Gower sign and pseudohypertrophy of calf muscles. It has a later onset (>5 years), slower progression , and allows for ambulation into adulthood. Cognitive impairment is less common, and life expectancy is longer, though cardiac and respiratory complications still contribute to morbidity. Emery-Dreifuss muscular dystrophy (Option C): It is also called Scapuloperoneal or Scapulohumeral muscular dystrophy It does not present with hypertrophy of the calf muscles. It is an X-linked recessive disease. Contractures of the elbows, ankles, and neck extensor muscles develop early, and the muscles become wasted in the scapulohumeral",
