      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: B) Chronic sinusitis, meconium ileus in infancy, and rectal prolapse Explanation: The presentation of chronic productive cough, recurrent respiratory infections, poor weight gain, and salty sweat is consistent with cystic fibrosis. Chronic sinusitis is a common manifestation of cystic fibrosis due to persistent inflammation and obstruction in the sinuses. Meconium ileus in newborns is often the first sign of cystic fibrosis, caused by thick, sticky meconium obstructing the intestines. Rectal prolapse is a common gastrointestinal feature in childhood for patients with cystic fibrosis. It occurs due to increased intra-abdominal pressure from chronic coughing. Clinical Features of Cystic Fibrosis System Clinical Features Respiratory Chronic productive cough Recurrent respiratory infections Nasal polyps Bronchiectasis Gastrointestinal Greasy stools (steatorrhea) Failure to thrive Rectal prolapse Malabsorption Meconium ileus in newborns Genitourinary Infertility in males (due to congenital absence of vas deferens), delayed puberty Others Digital clubbing, salt loss syndromes (hypochloremic metabolic alkalosis) Bronchial asthma, nasal polyps, and aspirin intolerance (Option A) is less indicative of cystic fibrosis as these features are more characteristic of Samter's triad rather than the hallmark symptoms of cystic fibrosis. Bronchiectasis, thrombocytopenia, and abdominal pain (Option C): Bronchiectasis is a feature of CF due to chronic lung infection and damage. However, thrombocytopenia is not commonly associated with CF , and abdominal pain alone is too nonspecific to indicate CF. Frequent diarrhea, poor weight gain, and recurrent otitis media (Option D): Frequent diarrhea and poor weight gain are features of CF due to malabsorption from pancreatic insufficiency. However, recurrent otitis media is not a feature of CF.",

      },
      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: C) Pneumatoceles Explanation: Pneumatoceles are commonly seen in Staphylococcal pneumonia, resulting from the formation of air-filled cavities within the lung due to the destruction of bronchoalveolar tissue and subsequent abscess formation. Type of Pneumonia X-ray Findings Staphylococcal Pneumonia Confluent bronchopneumonia, often unilateral (affecting one lung). Multiple microabscesses leading to pneumatoceles (Option C) Possible lung abscesses. Streptococcal Pneumonia Confluent lobar consolidation S.pneumoniae produces local edema that aids in the spread of organisms, often resulting in the characteristic focal lobar involvement. Primary Atypical Pneumonia Bilateral interstitial infiltrates with bronchial wall thickening Poorly defined hazy or fluffy exudates radiating from the hilar regions. Possible enlarged hilar lymph nodes and pleural effusion. Viral Pneumonia Bilateral interstitial infiltrates Hyperinflation of lungs Peribronchial cuffing (thickening of the airway walls). Type of Pneumonia Etiology Clinical Features Treatment Staphylococcal Pneumonia Staphylococcus (Primary/Secondary to septicemia) Predisposing factors: malnutrition, diabetes, macrophage dysfunction. Can complicate measles, influenza, cystic fibrosis, or follow staphylococcal pyoderma. Hospitalization IV fluids for hydration Oxygen for dyspnea/cyanosis Antibiotics: Penicillin G, Co-amoxiclav, Cloxacillin, or Ceftriaxone. Alternative: Vancomycin, Teicoplanin, Linezolid Drainage for empyema/pyopneumothorax Streptococcal Pneumonia Group A beta-hemolytic streptococci May follow measles, varicella, influenza, or pertussis. Interstitial pneumonia, often hemorrhagic. Abrupt onset with fever, chills, cough, dyspnea, rapid respiration, and blood-streaked sputum. Outpatient Treatment (Mild Cases): High-dose amoxicillin (90 mg/kg/day divided twice daily) Alternative options include cefuroxime or amoxicillin/clavulanate. Inpatient Treatment: Ampicillin or penicillin G Ceftriaxone or cefotaxime in cases with penicillin resistance Primary Atypical Pneumonia Mycoplasma pneumoniae, Chlamydia, Legionella spp. Common in winter epidemics among children in overcrowded living conditions. Rare under 4 years old. Incubation: 12-14 days. Macrolide antibiotics (Erythromycin, Azithromycin, Clarithromycin) Tetracycline for 7-10 days.

      "question": "A 3-year-old child is brought to the clinic with a cough and difficulty breathing. The mother reports that the child has been lethargic and unable to drink or breastfeed. On examination, you find that the child's oxygen saturation is 88%, and there is stridor when the child is calm. The AVPU scale indicates a response to painful stimuli only. Based on the signs observed, how should this child's condition be classified?",

        "B": "No Pneumonia: Cough or Cold",
        "C": "Severe Pneumonia or Very Severe Disease",
        "D": "Mild Respiratory Infection"
      },
      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: C) Severe Pneumonia or Very Severe Disease Explanation: Severe Pneumonia or Very Severe Disease is classified when a child presents with any general danger sign, oxygen saturation below 90%, stridor in a calm child, central cyanosis, or a response of V, P, or U on the AVPU scale. In this case, the child shows multiple severe signs, including lethargy, inability to drink, oxygen saturation of 88%, stridor, and a response to painful stimuli only, all of which indicate a very severe disease. Pneumonia - Etiology : Respiratory Syncytial Virus (RSV): The leading viral cause of pneumonia in infants. Streptococcus pneumoniae: The most common bacterial cause of pneumonia in children, especially in those aged 1-3 months. Pneumocystis jirovecii is a leading cause of pneumonia in HIV-infected infants and young children, particularly in settings with limited access to antiretroviral therapy (ART) and Pneumocystis pneumonia (PCP) prophylaxis. Other bacteria: E-coli, other Gram-negative bacilli, Hemophilus influenzae, Group B streptococcus. Other viruses: rhinoviruses, parainfluenza viruses, influenza viruses, human metapneumovirus, and adenovirus. Other fungal: Histoplasma, aspergillus, blastomyces, cryptococcus, mucormycosis, coccidioides. Parasitic: Ascaris, strongyloides. Mycobacterium tuberculosis, mycobacterium avium complex. Assessment and Classification of the Sick Child (Age 2 Months Up to 5 Years) Initial Assessment: A thorough history from the mother is essential Check for General Danger Signs: Ask Look Action Able to drink or breastfeed? Does the child vomit everything? H/O convulsions during this illness? Lethargic or unconscious? Currently convulsing? If any danger signs are present, the child needs URGENT attention. Assess Cough or Difficulty Breathing: Ask: How long has the child had a cough or difficulty breathing? Look, Listen, Feel: Count the breaths in one minute (use respiratory rate timers if available). Fast Breathing Criteria Age 2 months up to 12 months: Fast breathing is 50 breaths per minute or more. Age 12 months up to 5 years: Fast breathing is 40 breaths per minute or more. Look for chest in-drawing Look and listen for stridor, wheeze Check for central cyanosis Check oxygen saturation Check the AVPU scale (Alert, Voice, Pain, Unresponsive) Assess for possible asthma/TB if wheezing with chest in-drawing or fast breathing is present.

      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: C) Provide oxygen and ensure proper hydration Explanation: Chest X-ray finding of hyperinflation without focal infiltrate and symptoms like cough, wheezing and difficulty breathing in an infant point towards diagnosis of bronchiolitis. Supportive care with moist oxygen and hydration is the mainstay treatment of bronchiolitis. Investigation X-ray chest: Hyperinflation, minimal infiltrates, lowered diaphragm and lung fields appear abnormally translucent. Rapid RSV test: Using monoclonal antibodies against respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) on nasopharyngeal aspirate. Leukocyte count: Normal or slightly elevated. Course and Prognosis Self-limiting. Resolves in 3-7 days. Mortality in severe cases is around 1%. Treatment General: Symptomatic, child should be nursed in a humidified atmosphere in a sitting position. Home Care: For mild cases. Hospital Care: Moist oxygen inhalation (mainstay of treatment) Fluid and electrolyte balance (Option C) Very sick infants: 60% oxygen given through a hood. Pulse oximetry performed regularly to maintain oxygen saturation >92%. Medications: Antibiotics have no role (Option B) Ribavirin: Shorten the course of illness in high-risk infants with underlying congenital heart disease, chronic lung disease and immunodeficiency (Option D) Bronchodilators and steroids are generally not useful. (Option C) Inhaled hypertonic saline is useful (Option B) Severe Cases: May need CPAP (continuous positive airway pressure), mechanical ventilation, or ECMO (extracorporeal membrane oxygenation). Prevention Hand Hygiene: Effective for preventing virus transmission. Palivizumab (IM): Monoclonal antibody to RSV F protein (Protects only against RSV); Prophylactically given to reduce hospitalization risk in high-risk infants.",

      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: C) Bronchiolitis Explanation: 3 month old infant with cough, wheezing, and crackles, history of an upper respiratory tract infection 1 week ago along with examination findings of intercostal retractions and diffuse crackles point towards diagnosis of Bronchiolitis. Bronchiolitis Age Group Infants between 1 and 6 months, but can affect children up to 2 years old. Seasonality Occurs primarily in winter and spring. Causative Agent Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) (Most common) Others include: Parainfluenza virus Adenovirus Influenza virus Rarely Mycoplasma pneumoniae. Risk factors M/c in male infants. Infants exposed to tobacco smoke, not breastfed, or living in crowded conditions. Maternal smoking Older family members/siblings (common source of infection) Protection IgG3 antibodies (short half-life, limited placental transfer) Breastfeeding provides IgA antibodies. Pathophysiology Bronchiolar obstruction with edema, mucus and cellular debris. Increased airway resistance during both inspiration and exhalation. Leads to expiratory wheezing, air trapping, lung hyperinflation and possible atelectasis. Hypoxemia due to ventilation-perfusion mismatch. With severe obstructive disease hypercapnia develops. Clinical Manifestations First develop upper respiratory symptoms: Sneezing and clear rhinorrhea. Fever (±) Diminished appetite Persistent Cough Dyspnea Irritability Respiratory distress Cyanosis. Physical Examination Prolonged expiratory time Wheezing Increased work of breathing with nasal flaring and retractions Accessory muscles of respiration are working Auscultation: Fine crepitations and rhonchi Faint or inaudible breath sounds in severe disease Bronchial asthma (Option A) is unlikely because it is uncommon in infants under one year, often has a family history, usually involves multiple episodes, may occur without preceding respiratory infection and responds well to bronchodilators. Bacterial pneumonia (Option B) often presents with fever and localized lung findings. The diffuse crackles and wheezing here are more characteristic of bronchiolitis. Foreign body aspiration (Option D) is unlikely because there is no history of aspiration of foreign body. It typically presents with localized wheezing and signs of collapse or localized obstructive emphysema.

      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: B) Thumb sign Explanation: The given Lateral neck X-ray shows a swollen, rounded epiglottis that resembles a thumb. This sign is highly indicative of epiglottitis, along with symptoms like drooling, high fever, and severe sore throat. Acute Epiglottitis Life-threatening infection that causes profound swelling of the upper airways, which can lead to asphyxia and respiratory arrest. Causative Agent Past Era (Pre-vaccine): Haemophilus influenzae type b (Hib) Post-vaccine Era: Streptococcus pneumoniae (M/c), Streptococcus pyogenes, non-typeable H. influenzae, and Staphylococcus aureus Hib cases have decreased by 99% due to widespread vaccination. Clinical Features High fever, Sore throat, Dyspnea, Respiratory obstruction, Respiratory distress, Child appears toxic, Difficulty swallowing, Labored breathing, Drooling, Neck hyperextension to maintain airway, Tripod position (sitting upright, leaning forward) Stridor is a late sign indicating near-complete airway obstruction. Cyanosis, Coma. Diagnosis Laryngoscopy: Large, cherry-red, swollen epiglottis Lateral neck X-ray: Thumb sign Treatment Immediate Treatment: Secure the airway with endotracheal or nasotracheal intubation or, less often, with tracheostomy. Intubation is generally for 2-3 days. Intubation decreases mortality from 6% to <1% in epiglottitis cases. Culture Collection: Blood, epiglottic surface and CSF in certain cases after the airway is stabilized. Antibiotics: Ceftriaxone, cefepime or meropenem given parenterally for 10 days. Recovery Symptoms improve with a few days of antibiotics, and the patient may be extubated. Steeple sign (Option A) indicates characteristic narrowing of the subglottic region, seen in acute laryngotracheobronchitis (croup), not related to epiglottis. Sail sign (Option C) seen in infants as a triangular extension of the normal thymus laterally, not related to epiglottis. Double bubble sign (Option C) indicates radiograph findings of two adjacent fluid-filled echolucent structures within the abdomen of fetus, is seen in duodenal atresia, not related to epiglottis.",

      },
      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: C) CFTR modulators, antibiotics, chest physiotherapy Explanation: CFTR modulators (e.g., ivacaftor, lumacaftor) directly target the defective CFTR protein , improving its function and thereby helping to alleviate symptoms of CF at a molecular level. Trikafta (Elexacaftor-Tezacaftor-Ivacaftor and Ivacaftor) : For patients aged 2 years and older with cystic fibrosis, this medication was well tolerated and shown to improve lung function and reduce sweat chloride levels. Antibiotics are crucial for managing and preventing chronic pulmonary infections , which are a major cause of morbidity in CF patients. Management Strategies for Cystic Fibrosis Management Aspect Therapies Airway Clearance Chest physiotherapy, Percussion, Postural drainage Infection Control Antibiotics, CFTR modulators Nutritional Support High-calorie diet, Pancreatic Enzyme Replacement Therapy (PERT), Vitamin supplementation (A, D, E, K) CFTR Modulation CFTR modulators (e.g., ivacaftor, lumacaftor) Gastrointestinal Management Ursodeoxycholic acid, laxatives, enemas Other Therapies Insulin therapy (for CFRD), Bone health management (calcium, vitamin D) Inhaled bronchodilators, insulin therapy (Option A): Inhaled bronchodilators can be used for airway obstruction but do not address the underlying CFTR defect or chronic infections Insulin therapy is used for managing CF-related diabetes, due to impaired insulin secretion and insulin but is not the first-line treatment for overall CF management. This option lacks the key components like CFTR modulators and infection control. Chest physiotherapy, Ursodeoxycholic acid (Option B): Chest physiotherapy is indeed a cornerstone of CF management for mucus clearance, but without CFTR modulators or antibiotics, it does not fully manage CF. Ursodeoxycholic acid is used for managing liver disease in CF but is not relevant for lung infection control or nutritional management, which are more critical in this scenario. Inhaled corticosteroids, bone health management (Option D): Inhaled corticosteroids can reduce inflammation but are not typically first-line therapy for CF and are not generally used unless the patient has severe asthma. Bone health management (e.g., calcium and vitamin D supplementation) is essential in the long term but does not address immediate nutritional needs or infection control.

Presence of typical clinical features (such as recurrent respiratory infections and gastrointestinal issues) plus laboratory evidence of CFTR dysfunction is required for a definitive diagnosis of cystic fibrosis. Most common microbe causing infection in cystic fibrosis: <18 years: Staphylococcus aureus >18 years: Pseudomonas aeruginosa Burkholderia cepacia : Difficult to detect and treat; despite their low incidence, these infections are associated with a high mortality rate. Diagnostic Criteria for Cystic Fibrosis Diagnostic Criteria Requirement Any ONE of the following: Clinical Features Presence of typical features (respiratory, gastrointestinal, or genitourinary) Family History A sibling with diagnosed cystic fibrosis Newborn Screening Test Positive result indicating risk for cystic fibrosis Immunoreactive trypsinogen (IRT) is the first-line screen, which identifies babies with pancreatic insufficiency, one of the hallmarks of CF. PLUS at least ONE: Laboratory Evidence of CFTR Dysfunction Two elevated sweat chloride concentrations on separate days (Option C) Pilocarpine iontophoresis : Used to diagnose cystic fibrosis in infants by estimating sweat chloride ion levels; elevated chloride levels ( ≥ 60 mMol/L) in sweat are indicative of the condition.

      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: B) Impaired chloride transport resulting in dehydrated airway surfaces Explanation: The CFTR ∆ F508 mutation is the most common mutation causing cystic fibrosis. This mutation leads to defective CFTR protein , which impairs chloride transport across epithelial cells. As a result, water movement is reduced, leading to thick, dehydrated mucus in the respiratory tract. This viscous mucus impairs mucociliary clearance , trapping bacteria and leading to chronic infections, a hallmark of CF lung disease. Genetic Basis of Cystic Fibrosis: Gene Involved CFTR (Cystic Fibrosis Transmembrane Conductance Regulator) gene Chromosome Located on chromosome 7q31.2 Common Mutations ∆ F508 (deletion of phenylalanine at position 508) is the most common mutation. Classes of Mutations Class I : No functional CFTR protein Class II : CFTR trafficking defect Class III : Defective channel regulation Class IV : Decreased channel conductance Class V : Reduced synthesis of CFTR Class VI : Decreased CFTR stability Inheritance Pattern Autosomal recessive Pathophysiology of Cystic Fibrosis: CFTR Protein Dysfunction Defective chloride transport across epithelial cells Increased sodium absorption Decreased water movement leading to dehydrated mucous surfaces Respiratory System Thick, viscous mucus leads to airway obstruction and bacterial colonization Chronic infection and inflammation Bronchiectasis, atelectasis, and respiratory failure Gastrointestinal System Thick secretions block pancreatic ducts leading to enzyme insufficiency Malabsorption of fats and proteins Meconium ileus in neonates Distal Intestinal Obstruction Syndrome (DIOS) Hepatobiliary System Bile duct obstruction leading to biliary cirrhosis Sweat Glands Impaired chloride reabsorption leading to salty sweat Reproductive System Congenital absence of the vas deferens in males leading to azoospermia and infertility. Defective CFTR in the cervix leads to the production of thick, dehydrated cervical mucus that blocks the cervical os, impairing sperm entry and reducing fertility. Increased bicarbonate secretion leading to decreased mucus viscosity (Option A): In cystic fibrosis, bicarbonate secretion is actually decreased , not increased, leading to a more acidic and viscous mucus, which further complicates mucociliary clearance Enhanced ciliary function due to overactivation of ENaC channels (Option C): Ciliary function is impaired , not enhanced in cystic fibrosis due to the thickened mucus, due to overactivation of ENaC channels (due to loss of CFTR function). Decreased oxidative stress reducing bacterial clearance (Option D) : Cystic fibrosis is characterized by increased oxidative stress , not decreased. This heightened oxidative stress contributes to inflammation and tissue damage",

      "explanation": "Correct Answer: C) Silent chest Explanation: A silent chest, where breath sounds are minimal or absent, is a critical indicator of life-threatening asthma. Life-Threatening Asthma Management Overview Most severe asthma exacerbation; requires immediate attention. Indicators: Cyanosis, silent chest, poor respiratory effort, exhaustion, altered mental state, PEF <30%, oxygen saturation <90%. Immediate Management Oxygen Therapy: Administer for hypoxemia. Systemic Bronchodilators: Terbutaline or adrenaline subcutaneously; inhaled bronchodilators (salbutamol, ipratropium). Systemic Corticosteroids: IV hydrocortisone (5 mg/kg). ICU Transfer: For monitoring and advanced care. ICU Management Continuous Monitoring: Vital signs, oxygen saturation, PEF. If Improvement Noted: Continue inhaled bronchodilators (salbutamol/terbutaline) every 20-30 minutes. Maintain hydrocortisone at 2-3 mg/kg every 6-8 hours until the patient can take oral medication. If No Improvement or Deterioration: Consider slow intravenous infusion of magnesium sulfate (50 mg/kg). Alternatively, administer a loading dose of theophylline. If these measures fail, prepare for mechanical ventilation. Address Underlying Causes: Check for acidosis, pneumothorax, electrolyte imbalance, and infection. Mild wheezing (Option A) is more typical of less severe asthma exacerbations. An oxygen saturation of 92% (Option B) does not indicate life-threatening asthma.

      "explanation": "Correct Answer: B) Increase in FEV1 by >10% post-bronchodilator Explanation: An increase in FEV1 by > 10% after using a bronchodilator confirms the reversibility of airflow limitation, which is characteristic of asthma. Common Symptoms of Asthma: Recurrent dry cough, Expiratory wheezing, Shortness of breath, Chest congestion and tightness. General fatigue due to sleep disturbances. Difficulty keeping up with peers in physical activities. Severe Symptoms: Exhibit signs of air hunger. Air trapping leads to a hyperresonant chest. As obstruction worsens, it results in feeble breath sounds. Wheezing may disappear as the airflow becomes severely restricted. With improvements, airflow increases, and wheezing may reappear, indicating recovery. Severe hypoxemia results in cyanosis and cardiac arrhythmias. Symptom Timing: Symptoms may worsen at night, associated with sleep and exacerbations from infections or allergens. Daytime symptoms, particularly during physical activities, are frequent in children. Investigations of Asthma: Spirometry: Airflow limitation: Low FEV1 (relative to the percentage of predicted norms) FEV1/FVC ratio <0.80 (Option A) Bronchodilator response (to inhaled ß-agonist) assesses reversibility of airflow limitation. Reversibility is determined by an increase in either FEV1 >12% or Predicted FEV1 >12% after inhalation of a short-acting ß-agonist (SABA) (Option B) Exercise challenge: Worsening in FEV1 ≥ 15% (Option D) Daily peak expiratory flow (PEF) or FEV1 monitoring: Day-to-day and/or AM-to-PM variation ≥ 20% (Option C) Exhaled nitric oxide (FeNO): A value of >20 ppb supports the clinical diagnosis of asthma in children FeNO can be used to predict response to ICS therapy: <20 ppb: Unlikely to respond to ICS because eosinophilic inflammation is unlikely 20-35 ppb: Intermediate, may respond to ICS >35 ppb: Likely to respond to ICS because eosinophilic inflammation is likely. Chest Radiographs: Chest radiographs in children with asthma often appear normal. May show subtle signs such as hyperinflation (e.g., flattening of the diaphragms) and peribronchial thickening Allergy Testing: Assesses sensitization to inhalant allergens.

Bronchial Asthma is a disease characterized by episodic airway obstruction and airway hyperresponsiveness, usually accompanied by airway inflammation. Types of Asthma: 1. Transient non-atopic wheezing (Option A) 2. Persistent atopy-associated asthma (Option D) Common in early preschool years. Starting in early preschool years. Triggered by respiratory viral infections. Associated with atopy and involves clinical signs (like atopic dermatitis or allergic rhinitis) and biological markers (such as high serum IgE and eosinophils). Resolves by school age without increasing asthma risk later in life. Persists into later childhood and adulthood. Triggers of Asthma: Viral infections of the respiratory tract Aeroallergens: Indoor allergens (animal dander, dust mites, cockroaches, moulds) and seasonal allergens (pollens, moulds). Air pollutants: Environmental tobacco smoke, ozone, nitrogen dioxide, sulfur dioxide, particulate matter, mycotoxins, endotoxins, dust. Strong odours: Perfumes, hairsprays, cleaning agents. Occupational exposures: Farm exposures, formaldehydes, paint fumes. Cold, dry air Exercise Crying, laughter, hyperventilation. Comorbid conditions: Rhinitis, sinusitis, gastroesophageal reflux. Drugs: Aspirin, NSAIDs, beta-blockers Pathophysiology of Asthma: Type I hypersensitivity reaction Seasonal allergic asthma (Option B) is typically triggered by seasonal allergens, which does not fully capture the year-round nature of the child’s symptoms and their history of atopic conditions.

(Option C) Chest Compressions: If obstruction persists, turn the infant over and perform five chest compressions. (Option B) Sequence: Repeat back blows and chest compressions until the obstruction is relieved or the infant becomes unconscious. Procedure for Children (>1 year) (Option A) Heimlich Maneuver: Perform abdominal thrusts. Complications Chest Compressions: May cause rib or cardiac damage, though rare. Heimlich Maneuver: If performed incorrectly, the manoeuvre can cause pneumomediastinum, rupture of the spleen or stomach, and injury to the aorta.

      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: B) Left upper lobe Explanation: Based on the given scenario and the X-ray image, the diagnosis is congenital lobar emphysema. This condition is characterized by hyperinflation of a lobe and mediastinal shift. The left upper lobe is the most common location affected by congenital lobar emphysema . Congenital lobar emphysema (Congenital large hyperlucent lobe/ Congenital lobar hyperinflation) Causes Bronchial Abnormalities Congenital deficiency of bronchial cartilage Bronchial stenosis Redundant bronchial mucosal flaps External compression Aberrant vessels Kinking of bronchus due to herniation into mediastinum Common Location Left upper lobe > Right middle lobe > Right lower lobe. Involvement of lower lobes is rare.",

      "question": "A 2-week-old infant is brought to a pediatrics OPD due to feeding difficulties. The maternal history is unremarkable. On examination, the baby has a wet inspiratory stridor, that sounds like a low-pitched squeak. The pediatrician suspects laryngomalacia and is concerned about possible dysphagia. Which investigation is most appropriate to confirm the diagnosis?",

        "A": "Chest X-ray",
        "B": "Airway films",
        "C": "Fibre optic endoscopic evaluation",
        "D": "Outpatient flexible laryngoscopy"
      },
      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: C) Fibre optic endoscopic evaluation Explanation: In this scenario a wet stridor indicates dysphagia. Fibre optic endoscopic evaluation or a contrast swallow study is the investigation of choice when dysphagia is suspected. Laryngomalacia Definition M/c congenital laryngeal anomaly in children; characterized by floppy tissues above the vocal cords that collapse during inspiration, causing stridor. Accounts for 45% to 75% of stridor cases in infants. Onset Appear within the first 2 weeks of life and can worsen for up to six months, with gradual improvement often occurring thereafter. Factors deciding severity and clinical course Gastroesophageal reflux disease Laryngopharyngeal reflux disease Neurological conditions Investigations Diagnosis is made mainly by clinical symptoms Outpatient flexible laryngoscopy is done to confirm the diagnosis (Option D) but is not suitable for a baby as well as when dysphagia is suspected. Airway films and chest radiographs are done when the work of breathing is moderate to severe (Options A & B). A contrast swallow study or Flexible endoscopic evaluation of swallowing (FEES) is considered when dysphagia is suspected. (Option C) Complete bronchoscopy is done for those with moderate to severe obstruction. Treatment Expectant observation for most infants as the spontaneous resolution of symptoms as the child grows is seen. Laryngoesophageal reflux and GERD are treated with proton pump inhibitors or histamine receptor antagonists, considering the possible iron deficiency anemia. Supraglottoplasty is done in case of severe disease that causes progressive respiratory distress, cyanosis, failure to thrive, or cor pulmonale. Earlier intervention is needed in children with cardiac disease, neurologic disease, pulmonary disorders, or craniofacial anomalies Optic laryngosope for Laryngomalacia\" data-author=\"\" data-hash=\"1114\" data-license=\"\" data-source=\"\" data-tags=\"March2025\" src=\"https://image.prepladder.com/notes/p1z1zvEfjRQjDcxXa2WO1742221549.jpg\" />",
