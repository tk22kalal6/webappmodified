      "explanation": "nephroblastoma, is a rare kidney cancer that primarily affects children. The symptoms described, including a large, firm, non-mobile mass in the flank region, are consistent with this diagnosis. Wilm's tumor is the most common kidney cancer in children, and most cases are diagnosed before the age of 5. Incorrect Options: Option B - Angiomyolipoma: Angiomyolipomas are benign tumors that typically occur in the kidney. While they can cause a palpable mass, they are much more common in adults and are very rare in children. Option C - Renal cell carcinoma: Renal cell carcinoma is the most common type of kidney cancer in adults, but it is very rare in children. The child's age and the characteristics of the mass make this an unlikely diagnosis. Option D - Neuroblastoma: Neuroblastoma is a cancer that often starts in the adrenal glands, which are on top of the kidneys. It can cause a mass in the abdomen, but it is usually associated with other symptoms such as fever, bone pain, and unexplained weight loss.",

      "question": "A 4-year-old male child with a body weight of 15kg and height of 100cm is admitted with renal failure. His blood urea was 100 mg/dL and serum creatinine was 1 mg/dL. What is the closest calculated eGFR in the patient?",

        "D": "80 ml/min/1.73 m2 BSA"
      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: B) 40 ml/min/1.73 m2 BSA Explanation: The closest calculated eGFR in the patient is 40 ml/min/1.73 m2 BSA. Schwartz formula GFR (mL/min/1.73 m²) = (k x height (cm)) / Serum creatinine (mg/dL) Substituting the values: GFR = (0.41 x 100 cm) / 1 mg/dL = 41 mL/min/1.73 m² BSA. Purpose: Quick, bedside estimation of GFR using serum creatinine and height. Creatinine-Based: The formula uses serum creatinine as a marker, which can be affected by factors such as age, muscle mass, and diet. Height Inclusion: Height is included in the formula to account for the relationship between body size and kidney function, which is particularly important in growing children. Constant \"k\": The value of k varies as a function of age and sex being 0.33 in preterm infants, 0.45 in full-term infants, 0.55 in children and adolescent girls, and 0.70 in adolescent boys. This formula is generally used for estimating GFR in children and adolescents up to 18 years old . Limitations: Accuracy issues in populations with altered creatinine production or excretion. Not a gold standard ; less accurate compared to inulin or iohexol clearance. Clinical use: Often used alongside other findings to assess kidney function. Interpret results within the broader clinical picture, recognizing limitations. Age Group GFR (mL/min/1.73 m²) Inference Birth (Full-term Infants) 15-20 GFR is low at birth; renal function is still maturing. Birth (Preterm Infants) 10-15 Lower GFR compared to full-term infants due to underdeveloped kidneys. 2 Weeks 35-45 Rapid increase in GFR as renal function starts maturing. 2 Months 75-80 Continued rapid increase, nearing levels seen in older infants. Childhood (up to 2 years) Approaches 80-120 (comparable to adults after correction for body size) Renal function continues to improve, reaching near-adult GFR levels by age two when corrected for body surface area.

      "explanation": "Correct Answer: B) 2, 4 Explanation: The true statements regarding urinary tract infections (UTI) in children are that bowel-bladder dysfunction increases the risk of UTI recurrence , and micturating cysto-urethrogram (MCU) is performed in cases of recurrence. Urinary Tract Infections (UTIs) in Children: Etiology and Prevalence: Primary Cause: Colonic bacteria ascending the urinary tract. Common Pathogen: Escherichia coli (54-67% of cases). (1) Other Pathogens: Klebsiella spp., Proteus spp., Enterococcus, Pseudomonas. Clinical Features and Classification: Pyelonephritis (Kidney Infection): Upper renal collecting system involved Symptoms: Abdominal/back/flank pain, fever, malaise, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea. Newborns: Non-specific symptoms like poor feeding, irritability, jaundice, weight loss. Cystitis (Bladder Infection): Only bladder involved Symptoms: Dysuria, urgency, frequency, suprapubic pain, incontinence, malodorous urine. Typically does not cause high fever or renal injury. Risk Factors for Recurrent UTI: Vesicoureteral Reflux (VUR) Bladder-Bowel Dysfunction (BBD) (2) Obstructive Uropathy Urinary Tract Abnormalities: Anatomical issues like labial adhesion. Neuropathic Bladder Catheterisation: Procedures introducing bacteria. Sexual Activity: Increases UTI risk in females. Diagnosis: Urine Culture: Gold standard for UTI diagnosis; identifies and quantifies bacteria. Interpretation: A colony count of >50,000 colony-forming units/mL of a single pathogen, along with pyuria or bacteriuria in a symptomatic child, is generally considered diagnostic of a UTI. Urinalysis: Leukocyte Esterase and Nitrites positive. Imaging Studies: Treatment: Antibiotic Therapy: Mainstay of UTI treatment. Treatment Specific to UTI Presentations Acute Cystitis • Common Antibiotics: TMP-SMX (cotrimoxazole) (3) , Nitrofurantoin, Amoxicillin • Duration: 3-5 days Acute Pyelonephritis • Hospitalized: IV Ceftriaxone, Cefepime, Cefotaxime • Outpatient: Oral Cefixime, Cephalexin • Avoid Nitrofurantoin , use Fluoroquinolones for resistant strains. • Duration: 7-14 days Acute Lobar Nephronia/Abscess • Similar to pyelonephritis, but longer duration (14-21 days) • Percutaneous or surgical drainage for abscesses",

      "explanation": "Correct Answer B - Post-streptococcal glomerulonephritis The child here presents with dark urine, proteinuria, oliguria, hypertension and oedema with a history of throat infection 2 weeks back all suggest the diagnosis of post-streptococcal glomerulonephritis . Feature Post-streptococcal glomerulonephritis (PSGN) Clinical Presentation Acute nephritic syndrome: Hematuria, oliguria, edema, hypertension Proteinuria (1+ to 2+) levels of proteinuria Hematuria Common, with cola-colored urine due to gross hematuria Urinary Casts Red blood cell casts (indicating glomerular inflammation) Serum Albumin Usually normal unless severe renal impairment Blood Urea and Creatinine Elevated due to impaired renal function Serum Complement C3 Low in 90% of cases, returns to normal in 8-12 weeks Cholesterol No significant hypercholesterolemia ASO/Anti-DNase B Titers Elevated ASO titers (pharyngitis) or anti-DNase B (skin infection) Post-staphylococcal glomerulonephritis (Option A): While Staphylococcus aureus infections can also cause glomerulonephritis, they are less commonly associated with the classic immune complex deposits seen in PSGN. Nephrotic syndrome (Option C) involves the clinical findings of hypoalbuminemia, oedema, proteinurua and hyperlipidemia. Even though some clinical findings are similar to that given in the scenario, nephrotic syndrome does not cause dark-coloured urine IgA nephropathy (Option D) or Berger nephropathy is a chronic glomerular disease in children characterised by an increased concentration of IgA in the mesangial glomerular deposits with no systemic disease. It presents with gross hematuria within 1-2 days of a previous upper respiratory or GI infection and not after weeks; hence, it is not the diagnosis here.

      "question": "What is the most probable diagnosis for a young girl who experiences constant urine dribbling, despite voiding normally, and has never been completely dry since birth, according to her parents?",
      "options": {
        "A": "Ectopic ureter",
        "B": "Ureterocele",
        "C": "Congenital megaureter",
        "D": "Vesicoureteric reflux"
      },
      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: A) Ectopic ureter Explanation: The clinical scenario is suggestive of an ectopic ureter. This is a condition where the ureter, instead of terminating into the urinary bladder, terminates at a different site. Ectopic ureter Etiology Results from abnormal embryological development, often associated with ureteral duplication. Pathology Ectopic ureters drain to sites other than the bladder, commonly associated with duplication of the ureter. Pathophysiology Females, ectopic ureters open below the urethral sphincter or into the vagina, leading to incontinence. Males, ectopic ureters usually open above the external urethral sphincter, maintaining continence. Types Bilateral ectopic ureters (10% of cases). Unilateral ectopic ureters. Clinical Features Females: Continuous urinary incontinence despite normal voiding. Males: Typically asymptomatic or continent due to ureter opening above the sphincter. Diagnosis Computed Tomo-Urography (CTU). Magnetic Resonance Urography (MRU). Laboratory Investigations Primarily imaging-based diagnostics (CTU or MRU). Complications Persistent incontinence in females. Potential recurrent urinary tract infections. Differential Diagnosis Vesicoureteral Reflux Urethral Stricture : Difficulty in urination and weak stream, not continuous incontinence. Neurogenic Bladder : Treatment Surgical correction: Reposition it into the bladder to restore normal continence. Ureterocele (Option B) is a condition where the lower end of the ureter balloons out and forms a cyst-like structure within the bladder. This can cause urinary obstruction and lead to symptoms such as urinary frequency, urgency, or recurrent urinary tract infections. Congenital megaureter (Option C) refers to the dilation or enlargement of the ureter. It can be caused by an obstruction or a functional abnormality of the ureter. Congenital megaureter can cause urinary stasis, infections, or vesicoureteric reflux, but does not cause continuous urine leakage. Vesicoureteric reflux (Option D) is a condition where urine flows backwards from the bladder up into the ureters. It presents with recurrent UTIs and possible hydronephrosis but does not cause continuous dribbling. Reference: Bailey & Love's Short Practice of Surgery, 28th edition, Page 1467",

      "question": "What is true about vaccination in a child with steroid-dependent nephrotic syndrome who is brought to the OPD?",
      "options": {
        "A": "All live vaccines under NIS can be given as per schedule",
        "B": "All killed vaccines under NIS can be given",
        "C": "Only pneumococcal vaccine should be given to the child in the acute phase",
        "D": "Live vaccines are contraindicated in the child's sibling"
      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: B) All killed vaccines under NIS can be given Explanation: All killed vaccines under the NIS (National Immunization Schedule) can be given to a child suffering from steroid-dependent nephrotic syndrome. They have compromised immune systems, making them more susceptible to infections, so live vaccines are not given. Live vaccines can be administered in children receiving prednisolone dose < 1mg/kg daily or 2mg/kg on alternate days. If a patient is receiving steroid-sparing agents, live vaccines are contraindicated. In this case, as the patient is dependent on steroids, he must be receiving a higher dose of steroid/steroid-sparing agents. Hence, live vaccines are contraindicated in this case, as live vaccines contain weakened forms of the virus that can potentially cause the disease in individuals with weakened immune responses. (Option A ruled out) While the pneumococcal vaccine is important and can be given to a child with steroid-dependent nephrotic syndrome, it is not the only vaccine (Option C) that should be administered in the acute phase. Full pneumococcal vaccination and influenza vaccination can be given to the child and their household contact. Immunisation of siblings (Option D) and household contacts with live vaccines are important to reduce the risk of transmission to the immunocompromised child. Direct exposure to gastrointestinal and respiratory secretions is avoided for about 3 -6 weeks after immunization.

      "question": "A male infant was brought to the emergency pediatric unit with abdominal distention. There was a history of recurrent urinary tract infections.

        "B": "Posterior urethral valves",
        "C": "Horseshoe kidney",
        "D": "Pelviureteric junction obstruction"
      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer B- Posterior urethral valves Explanation: The presentation of abdominal distention, recurrent urinary tract infections, and urinary retention is consistent with the diagnosis of Posterior urethral valves (PUV). Also the bilateral hydronephrosis, which is the dilation of the renal pelvis and calyces due to urinary obstruction, further supports this diagnosis. Posterior urethral valves (PUV) are a congenital abnormality that occurs only in males. It is characterized by the presence of abnormal leaflets or flaps of tissue in the posterior urethra, leading to partial or complete obstruction of urine flow. Posterior urethral valves: Feature Description Definition Abnormal flaps of tissue in the posterior urethra that obstruct the flow of urine in male infants Etiology Developmental anomaly during fetal development Clinical Presentation Urinary tract obstruction symptoms, such as poor urinary stream, dribbling, or difficulty urinating Urinary tract infections (UTIs) with fever, irritability, and poor feeding Enlarged bladder (palpable abdominal mass) Hydronephrosis (swelling of the kidneys due to urine backup) Poor weight gain and growth Diagnostic Evaluation Voiding cystourethrogram (VCUG): Radiographic imaging to visualize the urinary tract and identify the valves Ultrasound of the kidneys and bladder to assess for hydronephrosis Blood tests: Renal function tests and electrolyte levels Management Endoscopic valve ablation or fulguration to remove or destroy the obstructing valves Surgical intervention: Valve resection or reconstruction in severe cases Management of urinary tract infections and associated complications Prognosis The prognosis varies depending on the severity of the obstruction and associated renal damage Early diagnosis and intervention can lead to better outcomes and improved renal function Long-term monitoring and follow-up are necessary to monitor renal function and manage any potential complications Incorrect Options: Vesicoureteric reflux (Option A): VUR is urine flow from the bladder to the ureters/kidneys due to an incompetent valve at the ureter-bladder junction. While this condition can cause recurrent UTIs, the primary feature is retrograde flow of urine & it typically doesn't present with significant urinary retention or abdominal distention. Horseshoe kidney (Option C): A horseshoe kidney is a congenital fusion anomaly of the kidneys, where the kidneys are fused at the lower poles. While it may be associated with hydronephrosis, it does not typically cause urinary retention or recurrent UTIs as described in the scenario. Pelviureteric junction obstruction (Option D): Although this condition can cause hydronephrosis, it typically presents unilaterally rather than bilaterally. Additionally, its presentation includes asymptomatic flank mass, upper abdominal pain & urinary tract infection (UTI). Reference: Nelson's Textbook of Pediatrics Edition 21st Page 2808-2810",
