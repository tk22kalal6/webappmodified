      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: C) Enalapril Explanation : ACE inhibitors (Enalapril) and Angiotensin II Receptor Blockers (Losartan) are the antihypertensive medications of choice in all children with pediatric CKD. Treatment of Pediatric CKD: Pediatric Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) requires a multifaceted approach to treatment, focusing on slowing disease progression, managing complications, and improving quality of life. Nutrition Management Dietary Protein restriction is not suggested. Children with CKD stage 2-5 should receive 100% of daily reference intake of vitamins and minerals. Blood Pressure Control Antihypertensive drugs, like ACE inhibitors or ARBs, are often prescribed to manage high BP. Anemia Treatment Erythropoietin-stimulating agents (ESAs) or iron supplements. Phosphate Binders (Calcium carbonate, calcium acetate, Sevelamer, Ferric citrate) to maintain normal serum calcium and phosphorus levels. Ergocalciferol or Cholecalciferol Typically recommended to treat insufficient 25OH vitamin D Bicitra or Sodium Bicarbonate tablets Used to maintain the serum bicarbonate levels > 22mEq/L. Recombinant human growth hormone(rHuGH) Given by daily subcutaneous injections and continues until the patient reaches 50th percentile for mid parental height. Dialysis and Kidney Transplantation Preferred treatment for children with end-stage renal disease. Vaccinations Special considerations for immunocompromised children. Metoprolol (Option A): Beta-blocker that can be used for blood pressure control. However, it does not have the added benefit of reducing proteinuria or slowing the progression of CKD, making it less appropriate as a first-line agent. Amlodipine (Option B): Calcium channel blocker that is effective in lowering blood pressure but does not significantly reduce proteinuria. Furosemide (Option D): Diuretic that can help manage fluid overload and lower blood pressure, but it does not reduce proteinuria or slow CKD progression.

      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: C) Hyperkalemia Explanation: Hyperkalemia is a common and serious electrolyte imbalance in AKI. The kidneys' impaired function leads to decreased excretion of potassium, causing its accumulation in the blood. Complication of Acute Kidney Injury(AKI) METABOLIC CARDIOPULMONARY GASTROINTESTINAL Hyperkalemia(M/C) Metabolic acidosis Hyponatraemia Hypocalcemia Hyperphosphatemia Hypermagnesemia Hyperuricemia Pericarditis Pulmonary oedema Arrhythmias Pericardial effusion Hypertension Myocardial infarction Pulmonary embolism Malnutrition Haemorrhage Uncontrolled projectile vomiting NEUROLOGIC HEMATOLOGIC OTHERS Asterixis Seizures Neuromuscular irritability Anaemia Haemorrhage Pneumonia Septicaemia Urinary tract infections Elevated parathyroid hormone levels Low thyroxine level levels Low total triiodothyronine levels Hypokalemia (Option A): Not typically associated with AKI. In fact, AKI often leads to hyperkalemia due to the kidneys' reduced ability to excrete potassium. Hypercalcemia (Option B): Not a common complication of AKI. AKI can actually lead to hypocalcemia (low calcium) due to reduced conversion of vitamin D to its active form, affecting calcium absorption. Hyponatremia (Option D): Not as commonly associated with AKI as hyperkalemia. While fluid overload in AKI can dilute sodium levels, hyperkalemia is a more direct and frequent issue.

      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: B) Nephrotic syndrome Explanation: Nephrotic syndrome is strongly associated with the development of renal vein thrombosis (RVT). Renal Vein Thrombosis (RVT) Definition Renal vein thrombosis (RVT) is the formation of a blood clot in the renal vein. Causes Dehydration: Risk factor, particularly in infants. Central venous catheters: Disrupt blood flow, increasing clot risk. Inherited thrombophilia: Genetic predisposition to clotting, eg. factor-V leiden mutation, protein-C,S deficiency Nephrotic syndrome: Strongly associated with RVT due to changes in blood clotting factors. Membranous glomerulonephritis Drug induced: Combined oral contraceptives, steroids, asparaginase Immunological disorders: SLE, Rheumatoid arthritis Others: pregnancy, cancer, Hemolytic uremic syndrome Pathophysiology Damage to the renal vein’s inner lining due to trauma, inflammation, or catheters. Activation of platelets and clotting factors leads to clot formation.The growing clot blocks blood flow, causing kidney swelling and dysfunction. Clinical Features Sudden flank pain: Common symptom, especially with rapid clot development. Hematuria: Blood in urine due to obstructed blood flow and kidney damage. Kidney enlargement: Due to obstructed blood flow. Decreased urine output: Impaired kidney function. Diagnosis Ultrasound CT Scan: useful if ultrasound is inconclusive. MRI. Complications Pulmonary embolism: Clot travels causing obstructing blood flow. Stroke: Clot travels causing a stroke. Kidney failure: Persistent obstruction leads to irreversible damage. Treatment Blood thinners (anticoagulants) Thrombolytic therapy (clot busters). Surgery: To remove clot or repair vein. Hypertension (Option A): It is not directly associated with an increased risk of RVT. Polycystic kidney disease (Option C): This condition causes cyst formation in the kidneys and can lead to chronic kidney disease. Diabetes mellitus (Option D) is not specifically linked to an increased risk of RVT compared to nephrotic syndrome.

      "explanation": "Correct Answer: B) Ectopic ureter Explanation: An ectopic ureter is a ureter that drains to locations other than the bladder, commonly associated with ureteral duplication. Ectopic ureter Etiology Results from abnormal embryological development, often associated with ureteral duplication. Pathology Ectopic ureters drain to sites other than the bladder, commonly associated with duplication of the ureter. Pathophysiology Females, ectopic ureters open below the urethral sphincter or into the vagina, leading to incontinence. Males, ectopic ureters usually open above the external urethral sphincter, maintaining continence. Types Bilateral ectopic ureters (10% of cases). Unilateral ectopic ureters. Clinical Features Females: Continuous urinary incontinence despite normal voiding. Males: Typically asymptomatic or continent due to ureter opening above the sphincter. Diagnosis Computed Tomo-Urography (CTU). Magnetic Resonance Urography (MRU). Laboratory Investigations Primarily imaging-based diagnostics (CTU or MRU). Complications Persistent incontinence in females. Potential recurrent urinary tract infections. Differential Diagnosis Vesicoureteral Reflux (Option A) Urethral Stricture (Option C) : Difficulty in urination and weak stream, not continuous incontinence. Neurogenic Bladder (Option D) : Treatment Surgical correction: Reposition it into the bladder to restore normal continence. Vesicoureteral Reflux (Option A): usually seen in children, presenting with recurrent UTI. Urethral Stricture (Option C) : typically presents with hesitancy, poor flow, prolonged voiding time and rarely retention. Neurogenic Bladder (Option D): usually presents with increased urinary frequency and nocturia with or without urinary incontinence. Reference: Bailey & Love's Short Practice of Surgery Page 1467.",

Bladder exstrophy Etiology Disruption in normal development during pregnancy. Exact triggers remain unclear. Pathology & Pathophysiology Improper development of the cloacal membrane. Early rupture leads to epispadias (incomplete urethral formation). Later rupture results in bladder exstrophy. Types Spectrum from simple epispadias to more complex forms of bladder exstrophy. Clinical Features Males: Shortened penis due to pubic bone separation (diastasis of the pubic symphysis). Widely spaced crura (internal, spongy columns within the penis). Underdeveloped corporeal tissue (erectile tissue). Females: Shortened and narrowed vagina, often positioned more anteriorly. Bifid clitoris (split into two parts). Complications Urinary function issues. Increased risk of infections. Risk factor for Adenocarcinoma.. Surgical Treatment Cover the bladder with a wet sterile plastic wrap and plan for surgery. Surgical repair, in multiple stages. Steps Include: Closing the bladder and placing it back inside the body. Reconstructing the urethra. Repairing the abdominal wall defect.

      "question": "A 6-year-old child has a height of 110 cm and a serum creatinine level of 0.8 mg/dL. Using the Schwartz formula with a constant \"k\" value of 0.42, what is the estimated GFR (mL/min/1.73 m²)?",

        "D": "66.75 mL/min/1.73 m²"
      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: B) 57.75 mL/min/1.73 m² Explanation : Schwartz formula GFR (mL/min/1.73 m²) = (k x height (cm)) / Serum creatinine (mg/dL) Substituting the values; GFR = (0.42 x 110 cm) / 0.8 mg/dL = 57.75 mL/min/1.73 m². (Option B) Purpose: Quick, bedside estimation of GFR using serum creatinine and height. Creatinine-Based: Relies on serum creatinine, influenced by age, muscle mass, and diet. Height Inclusion: Reflects correlation between body size and kidney function, especially in children. Constant \"k\": Accounts for age-related variations in creatinine; values range from 0.41 to 0.43. Limitations Accuracy issues in populations with altered creatinine production or excretion. Not a gold standard; less accurate compared to inulin or iohexol clearance. Clinical use Often used alongside other findings to assess kidney function. Interpret results within the broader clinical picture, recognizing limitations. Age Group GFR (mL/min/1.73 m²) Inference Birth (Full-term Infants) 15-20 GFR is low at birth; renal function is still maturing. Birth (Preterm Infants) 10-15 Lower GFR compared to full-term infants due to underdeveloped kidneys. 2 Weeks 35-45 Rapid increase in GFR as renal function starts maturing. 2 Months 75-80 Continued rapid increase, nearing levels seen in older infants. Childhood (up to 2 years) Approaches 80-120 (comparable to adults after correction for body size) Renal function continues to improve, reaching near-adult GFR levels by age two when corrected for body surface area.

      "question": "A 5-year-old child presents with persistent hypertension and growth retardation. Urine examination reveals proteinuria, and blood tests show elevated creatinine levels. Which of the following methods is the most appropriate for estimating the glomerular filtration rate (GFR) in this child?",
      "options": {

      },
      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: C) Creatinine clearance Explanation: Creatinine clearance is considered one of the most accurate for estimating GFR, especially in pediatric patients. It accounts for both serum creatinine levels and urine output. Kidney Functions Assessment Clinical Features Abnormal Urine Stream: Weak/intermittent stream (posterior urethral valves); dribbling (abnormal ureteral insertion, neurogenic bladder) Urinary Symptoms: Dysuria, flank pain, ureteric colic (UTIs, urinary tract stones) Polyuria & Polydipsia: Excessive urination/thirst (diabetes insipidus) Hypertension: High blood pressure (renal parenchymal/renovascular disease) Growth Retardation & Anemia: Growth delays, normocytic normochromic anemia (advanced CKD) Abdominal Mass: Palpable mass (multicystic dysplastic kidney, polycystic kidneys, renal vein thrombosis, hydronephrosis, Wilms' tumor) Urine Examination Color: Normal is clear yellow; red urine may indicate hematuria (postinfectious glomerulonephritis) Proteinuria: Excess protein indicates renal injury (glomerular disease) Microscopic Exam: Identifies cellular elements, crystals, and casts for kidney issues Blood Tests Renal Function: Creatinine and urea levels (creatinine more reliable than BUN) Other Tests: May include albumin, cholesterol, antibodies, and electrolytes. Glomerular Filtration Rate (GFR) Creatinine Clearance: Estimates GFR by measuring creatinine clearance from blood Plasma Clearance of Iohexol: Accurately estimates GFR using iohexol Radionuclide Clearance: Measures GFR with minimal radiation using radionuclides Imaging of the Urinary Tract Ultrasonography: First-line for visualizing kidneys and detecting abnormalities (e.g., hydronephrosis, tumors) Micturating Cystourethrography (MCU): Diagnoses vesicoureteric reflux, posterior urethral valves, neurogenic bladder Radionuclide Imaging: Non-invasive method to assess kidney function and detect abnormalities Genetic Testing Diagnosing inherited kidney disorders; includes next-generation sequencing and multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification Kidney Biopsy Used when non-invasive methods are insufficient;. Helps diagnose conditions like IgA nephropathy and various types of glomerulonephritis, Serum creatinine measurement (Option A): While serum creatinine is used to estimate GFR, it is not the most accurate standalone measure, especially in children, where muscle mass can influence creatinine levels. Blood urea nitrogen (BUN) test (Option B): BUN levels can be influenced by factors other than kidney function, such as hydration status and protein intake, making it less reliable for estimating GFR.
