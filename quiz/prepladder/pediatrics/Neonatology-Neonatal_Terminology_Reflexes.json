        "D": "Rooting reflex"
      },
      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: A) ATNR Explanation: ATNR is typically triggered when the infant's head is rotated to one side, resulting in an extension of the arm on the same side and flexion of the arm on the opposite side. This is a normal reflex that helps with hand-eye coordination and usually disappears in 6-7 months. The parachute reflex, which appears around 7-8 months and is fully developed by 10-11 months, is a protective reflex where the infant extends their arms when falling to break the fall. Reflex Onset Disappearance Description Rooting 32 wk gestation 1 month The rooting reflex, where the mouth turns toward a stimulus, is triggered by gently stroking the cheek or presenting an object within the infant's line of sight. Tonic neck reflexes: 1) Asymmetric Tonic Neck Reflex (ATNR): 35 wk gestation 3 months ATNR is triggered by rotating the infant's head to one side, which causes extension of the arm on the side the face is turned to and flexion of the arm on the opposite side. This reflex helps in hand-eye coordination development.

      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: C) Pre-term and Very Low Birth Weight (VLBW) Explanation: The infant was born at 36 weeks gestation, classifying them as Preterm (<37 weeks) . With a birth weight of 1,200 grams, they are also categorized as Very Low Birth Weight (VLBW) (<1,500 grams). Therefore, the newborn is best classified as both Pre-Term and VLBW. Classification according to gestational age Pre-Term Born at < 37 weeks of gestation. Term (Option B) Born between 37 completed weeks to <42 weeks of gestation. Post-Term (Option D) Born at or beyond 42 weeks of gestation. Classification according to Birth weight Low birth weight(LBW) (Option A) <2500 grams birth weight. Very low birth weight (VLBW) <1500 grams Birth Weight. Extremely low birth weight (ELBW) <1000 grams birth weight.

      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: B) Appropriate for Gestational Age (AGA) Explanation: The infant's weight falls within the 10th to 90th percentile for their gestational age, classifying them as Appropriate for Gestational Age (AGA). Classification according to gestational age and birth weight. Appropriate for gestational age (AGA) The baby's weight is appropriate for the gestational age (weight between the 10th and 90th percentile). Small for gestational age (SGA) (Option A) Baby's weight is less than expected for the gestational age (weight less than 10th percentile). Large for gestational age (LGA) (Option C) The baby's weight is more than expected for the gestational age (weight more than the 90th percentile). Pre-Term and Low Birth Weight (LBW) (Option D): Pre-Term refers to infants born before 37 weeks of gestation, and LBW is defined as a birth weight of less than 2,500 grams. The infant in the scenario was born at 38 weeks with a weight of 3,200 grams, so neither pre-term nor LBW criteria are met.

      },
      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: C) Maternal obesity Explanation: While maternal obesity can contribute to a high-risk pregnancy, it does not directly contribute to the described complications in the same way as multiple gestations, gestational diabetes, or preeclampsia would. Obesity is more of a maternal health condition rather than a pregnancy-related complication. The other options—multiple gestations, gestational diabetes, and preeclampsia—are all recognized pregnancy-related complications that can contribute to the infant's high-risk status. High-risk Infant: A “high-risk infant” is broadly defined as one who requires more than the standard monitoring and care offered to a healthy-term newborn infant Factors Associated with High-Risk Infants 1. Maternal Factors: Maternal health conditions: High blood pressure Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS) Diabetes Kidney disease Autoimmune diseases (e.g., Lupus, Multiple Sclerosis) Thyroid disease Obesity HIV/AIDS Maternal Age Young age (Teen pregnancy) First-time pregnancy after age 35 Lifestyle Factors Smoking/alcohol/drugs 2 .

      "explanation": "Correct Answer: B) Moro’s Reflex Explanation: Moro’s Reflex is expected to be present at 2 months as it persists from 28-37 weeks of gestation and disappears around 3-6 months of age. Reflexes present at birth in a term neonate: Name of the reflex Definition Appears at (weeks of gestation) Disappears at (Postnatal age) Rooting Reflex The rooting reflex is where the mouth turns toward an object. Triggered by lightly stroking the cheek or by bringing an object into the patient's visual field. 32 weeks 1 month Moro’s Reflex The Moro reflex is a protective response to sudden loss of balance Elicited by raising the baby’s head slightly, and dropping it suddenly, while the other hand still supports the baby Response : Palm opening; extension, abduction of upper extremities & anterior flexion of body. 28-37 weeks 3-6months Palmar/Plantar Grasp Reflex The grasping reflex can be triggered by applying sustained pressure to the palm, causing the patient’s fingers to flex and grasp the object applying the pressure. 28 weeks 4 months ATNR (Asymmetric Tonic Neck Reflex) The asymmetric tonic neck reflex is performed by manual rotation of the infant’s head to one side The infant will extend its arm to the side of the rotated face and flex the contralateral arm. 35 weeks 3 months Reflexes present after birth: Name of the reflex Definition Appears at Disappears at (Postnatal age) STNR (symmetric tonic neck reflex) (Option A) Elicited by passive movement of the head, giving the following response: Neck flexion: Upper extremities flex, lower extremities extend. Neck extension: Upper extremities extend, lower extremities flex. Important for activities like sitting, swimming, and playing with a ball. 6-9 months 9-11 months Parachute reflex (Option C) The reflex is triggered by turning the child upside down, Response: The arms move forward and the hands spread out in an attempt to catch the fall. 8-9 months Landau reflex (Option D) Elicit by supporting the infant horizontally in a prone position. Positive reaction: The infant raises its head and arches back upward. Subsidiary response : Partial extension of lower limbs at the hips. 3 months 1 year Neck righting reflex Elicited by turning the child’s head 90 degrees while lying flat. Normal response: the body follows the direction of the head turn due to torsion of the vertebral column.

      "question": "A 1-day-old newborn shows no startle response to sudden movement or sound. The pediatrician notes an absent Moro reflex, with no asymmetry. The baby is alert but cries weakly. What is the most likely cause?",
      "options": {
        "A": "Erb’s palsy",

        "D": "Clavicle fracture"
      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: B) Severe asphyxia during birth Explanation: Severe asphyxia can cause brain damage due to oxygen deprivation, which often leads to an absent Moro reflex . In this scenario, the weak cry and the absent reflex strongly suggest a potential neurological injury caused by perinatal hypoxia. Moro Reflex: The Moro reflex or Startle reflex is a primitive neonatal reflex that can be elicited by supporting the baby's head and letting it fall back slightly while still supporting it. This triggers a response where the baby first extends and abducts their arms and fingers, then flexes the arms back towards the body, typically accompanied by a cry. The reflex begins to develop in utero , with hand opening at 28 weeks, arm extension and abduction at 32 weeks , and full response (including flexion) by 37 weeks . Normally, the Moro reflex disappears by 3 to 6 months of age . ABNORMAL MORO REFLEX CAUSES Absent Moro Reflex Birth injuries: Trauma during delivery Intracranial hemorrhage Severe asphyxia: Oxygen deprivation during birth General muscular weakness Cerebral palsy: Especially in spastic forms, the reflex may be absent. Asymmetric Moro Reflex Brachial plexus injury e.g., Erb's palsy (Option A) Clavicle fracture (Option D) Cervical spine injury Exaggerated Moro Reflex Hyperekplexia: A genetic disorder with an exaggerated startle response, often accompanied by muscle rigidity.

      "explanation": "Correct Answer: D) All of the above Explanation: All the conditions listed ( subconjunctival haemorrhage, acne neonatorum, and Epstein pearls ) are typically self-limiting and do not require medical treatment to resolve. BENIGN NEONATAL CONDITIONS SUBCONJUNCTIVAL HEMORRHAGE (Option A) Subconjunctival haemorrhages are frequently observed due to birth trauma caused by sudden increases in internal or external pressure. Common factors include: Following vaginal delivery Difficult or extended labour Fetal macrosomia Improper use of forceps or vacuum extractors Typically resolve on their own. ACNE NEONATORUM (Option B) Acne neonatorum, or neonatal acne, is a common condition in newborns characterized by facial eruptions of inflamed and non-inflamed lesions. It usually appears around 3 weeks of age and lasts about 4 months. Males>females. The condition, linked to sebaceous gland overactivity due to neonatal androgens, typically resolves on its own within 3 months. EPSTEIN PEARLS (Option C) Epstein pearls are small, benign cysts that commonly appear in newborns' mouths, particularly on the gums and the roof of the mouth. These white or yellowish bumps, caused by trapped skin cells filled with keratin, can be mistaken for teeth due to their firmness. Present in about 85% of newborns, Epstein pearls typically resolve on their own within a few weeks to within 3 months and do not require treatment. Activities such as breastfeeding or using pacifiers can help them dissolve more quickly.",

      "correct_answer": "D",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: D) 2, 4, 5 Explanation: Neonatal vaginal bleeding is a normal physiological process caused by decreased maternal estrogen and typically resolves within 10 days. (Statement 2) It is normal for term neonates to lose 7-10% of their birth weight in the first week due to loss of extracellular fluid. (Statement 4) Physiologic phimosis is a normal condition where the foreskin cannot be retracted and generally resolves by age 3-5 without causing symptoms. (Statement 5) Condition Features Duration Management Mastitis Neonatorum Infection of breast tissue related to maternal hormones. Symptoms include unilateral breast swelling , erythema, warmth, tenderness, and possible purulent discharge. (Statement 1) Resolves within a few weeks Antibiotics; usually resolve on their own Vaginal Bleeding Normal due to decreased maternal estrogen. Symptoms include a small amount of blood-tinged discharge or bleeding. Resolves within 10 days Medical evaluation if bleeding persists or if other concerns arise Hymenal Tags Benign remnants of tissue at the vaginal opening. Normal anatomical variations and typically asymptomatic. Often resolves on its own (Statement 3) Treatment only if causing discomfort Physiologic Weight Loss Expected weight loss in the first week of life. Term neonates lose 7-10% of birth weight; preterm infants lose 10-15%. They then gain about 20 to 40 grams daily. This initial weight loss is primarily due to the loss of extracellular fluid, while subsequent weight gain is attributed to increased intracellular water and solids, supporting cellular growth. Term infants regain within 7-10 days; preterm infants by 10-14 days (Statement 6) Weight gain of 20-40 grams daily after regaining birth weight. Physiologic Phimosis A normal condition where the foreskin cannot be retracted due to preputial adhesion. Generally asymptomatic. This differs from pathologic phimosis which involves scarring or inflammation, which may need treatment. The prepuce becomes retractable by 3 yr of age. Resolves by age 3-5; may take longer Gentle retraction during bathing to aid in loosening.",

      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: B) Cephalohematoma Explanation: Cephalohematoma presents as a well-circumscribed, firm mass over the parietal bones that does not cross suture lines. It typically develops in the first few hours after birth, with increasing size for 12-24 hours, and then stabilizes. This fits the description provided in the scenario. Characteristic Caput Succedaneum (Option A) Cephalohematoma (Option B) Incidence Common Less common Location Subcutaneous plane Over parietal bones, between the skull and periosteum. Time of Presentation Maximum size and firmness at birth. Develops during the 1st few hours of life. Increasing size for 12-24 hours and then stable. Time Course Softens progressively from birth. Takes 3-6 weeks to resolve, but may resolve within 2-3 days. Characteristic Findings Diffuse Circular boggy area of oedema with indistinct borders. Often with overlying ecchymosis Crosses suture line Well-circumscribed fluid-filled mass. Does not cross the suture line Association None Linear skull fracture (5-25%); hyperbilirubinemia Subgaleal Hemorrhage (Option C) is a more diffuse, larger haemorrhage that crosses suture lines and is associated with more severe symptoms. It is less likely to present as a firm, well-defined mass and is typically associated with significant blood loss, which is not described in the scenario. Craniotabes (Option D) refers to soft areas of the skull due to delayed skull bone ossification that may feel soft and dentable, like a ping pong ball , often found in the parietal bones near the sagittal suture, typically in preterm infants or those with uterine compression. Craniotabes present as soft areas rather than firm, localized masses and are more common in different contexts, such as preterm birth or specific congenital conditions.
