      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: B) Leaves a characteristic scar 6-12 months after injection. Explanation: The BCG vaccine typically causes a papule at the injection site that ulcerates within 3-6 weeks and heals with a characteristic scar over 6-12 weeks. Aspect Details About BCG The BCG vaccine contains live attenuated M. bovis Calmette—Guérin strain. In India, the Copenhagen (Danish 1331) strain is used. Available as a lyophilized powder in vacuum-sealed dark multidose vials . When reconstituted with sterile normal saline, each 0.1 mL dose contains 0.1-0.4 million live bacilli. It remains stable in lyophilized form at 2- 8°C for one year but loses potency rapidly once reconstituted and thus discarded after 4 hours.

Protective Efficacy Primary Infection: ~40% protective efficacy. (Option A ruled out) Pulmonary Tuberculosis: 8-79% protective efficacy. All Forms of Tuberculosis: ~50% protective efficacy. Severe Forms (e.g., miliary tuberculosis, tubercular meningitis): 72-100% protective efficacy. (Option A ruled out) Childhood Tuberculosis: Accounts for 15-20% of cases, often disseminated; vaccination prevents serious morbidity. Reduces the risk of mortality from severe tuberculosis. Immunity Duration typically wanes over 10-15 years ; Repeating vaccination in adolescence or adulthood does not extend protection. National Program At birth; catch up until 1 year (if missed). IAP 2021 At birth; catch up until 5 years. (Option C ruled out) Injection and Reaction Initial Reaction: A 5-7 mm wheal forms. One Week: Bacilli multiply, forming a 4-8 mm papule . 3-6 Weeks: The papule ulcerates . 6-12 Weeks: The ulcer heals with scarring . Adverse Reactions Local ulceration; discharging sinus; axillary lymphadenitis; If immunodeficient, disseminated infection, osteomyelitis; scrofuloderma.

Rarely, this leads to liver failure and death. Vaccines Available Inactivated (killed) Vaccine: Administered in two doses, with the second dose given at least 6 months after the first. Live, Weakened Vaccine: Given as a single dose starting at 12 months of age. Safety and Administration Both vaccines are generally safe with minor side effects such as local pain, swelling, and low-grade fever. All children over 12 months should receive the vaccine. The vaccine is not recommended for those with severe allergies to vaccine components or those with weakened immune systems. Prevention Maintaining good hygiene and sanitation is crucial, but vaccination is the most effective way to prevent Hepatitis A. Give both the first Hepatitis A dose and an additional Hepatitis B dose. (Option B): The child has completed the Hepatitis B vaccine series, so no additional Hepatitis B dose is required.

Correct Answer: B) Transitioning from trivalent OPV to bivalent OPV (bOPV) and introducing inactivated polio vaccine (IPV) into routine schedules Explanation: The transition to bivalent OPV and incorporating IPV helps mitigate cVDPV risks. Polio Vaccines Overview: Types of Polio Vaccines: Attribute Oral Polio Vaccine (OPV) Inactivated Polio Vaccine (IPV) Composition Weakened (attenuated) Sabin poliovirus strains grown in monkey kidney cells. Killed (inactivated) poliovirus - Salk’s. Administration Oral Injection Immunity Provides mucosal immunity in the gut. Primarily induces a systemic immune response. Advantages Stronger mucosal immunity \"Herd immunity\" reducing wild poliovirus transmission No risk of VAPP or cVDPV circulation. Effective in preventing paralytic poliomyelitis. Disadvantages Requires multiple doses. Rare risk of vaccine-associated paralytic poliomyelitis (VAPP). Emergence of circulating vaccine-derived polioviruses (cVDPVs). Weaker mucosal immunity. More complex and expensive to manufacture. (Option C ruled out) Evolution of Polio Vaccination Strategies: Historical Focus : Relied on OPV for its ease of use and herd immunity benefits. Shift in Strategy : The emergence of cVDPVs, especially type 2 (cVDPV2), led to a switch from trivalent OPV to bivalent OPV (bOPV) in 2016, and the introduction of IPV in routine schedules. (Option A ruled out) (Option B) Current Approach : Sequential IPV-OPV schedules are used, transitioning to exclusive IPV use once wild poliovirus is no longer circulating. (Option D ruled out) Current Recommendations and Path Towards Eradication: WHO Guidelines : OPV-only schedules are no longer recommended. India's Success : The last case of wild poliovirus was reported in 2011; continued use of OPV for immunization days to prevent importation risks. Future Vision : Aiming to replace OPV with IPV globally, with interim strategies like fractional IPV dosing to enhance coverage. Indian Academy of Pediatrics (IAP) Recommendations: Primary Immunisation : IPV-based schedule with three doses at 6, 10, and 14 weeks of age. Booster Doses : Recommended in the second and fifth years of life. Replacing all OPV doses with IPV doses in the primary immunization schedule (Option C) is incorrect as a complete replacement with IPV is not yet feasible due to IPV supply limitations.

      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "12 hours of birth. Correct Answer: C) Administer hepatitis B immunoglobulin (HBIG) and hepatitis B vaccine within 12 hours of birth. Explanation: For preterm infants born to HBsAg-positive mothers, regardless of birth weight, it is crucial to administer both hepatitis B immunoglobulin (HBIG) and the hepatitis B vaccine within 12 hours of birth to prevent hepatitis B infection. This is a critical step in managing potential exposure to the hepatitis B virus. HIV +ve Individuals: Inactivated Vaccines : Most are recommended, but effectiveness may vary based on immune deficiency. Live Vaccines : Generally contraindicated, with exceptions: MMR : Administer if asymptomatic or with mild symptoms (CD4+ ≥ 15%). Varicella : Consider if CD4+ ≥ 15%; MMRV is not recommended. Yellow Fever : Contraindicated for severely immunocompromised under 6; specific precautions for others. Other Vaccines : Pneumococcal : PCV13 and PPSV23 are recommended. Meningococcal : MCV4 is recommended for children ≥ 2 months. Hib : Recommended if not given during infancy. Immunocompromised Individuals: General Principles : Vaccination varies by condition, severity, risk, and vaccine type. Live Vaccines : Typically contraindicated; exceptions based on condition and vaccine. Inactivated Vaccines : Effective but may be reduced based on immune deficiency. Planned Splenectomy: Pneumococcal Vaccines : PCV13 : Administer first. PPSV23 : Administer at least 8 weeks after PCV13. Meningococcal Vaccine : MCV4 recommended. Hib Vaccine : Recommended if not previously completed or given after 14 months. Influenza Vaccine: Annual vaccination is recommended to protect against seasonal influenza, which can be more severe in post-splenectomy patients. Preterm Infants: General Recommendations : Vaccinate based on chronological age, similar to full-term infants. Hepatitis B Vaccine : For ≥ 2 kg and stable : Birth dose within 24 hours. For < 2 kg : Birth dose deferred until 1 month or hospital discharge (if HBsAg-negative mother). All preterm, low-birthweight infants born to HBsAg-positive mothers should receive HBIG and hepatitis B vaccine within 12 hours of birth, with three additional doses starting at 1 month. Vaccination in Elderly: Influenza (flu) : Annual vaccination, especially with high-dose or adjuvanted vaccines, helps protect against flu complications such as pneumonia and organ failure. Pneumococcal vaccine : A one-time vaccine against bacterial infections that can cause severe pneumonia. Shingles : A two-dose series to prevent shingles and its complications, like postherpetic neuralgia. Tdap (Tetanus, Diphtheria, Pertussis) : Booster shots every 10 years to maintain immunity. RSV (Respiratory Syncytial Virus) : Newly approved for older adults, especially those with heart or lung conditions.",

Protect Against Diseases: Addresses increased vulnerability to diseases due to lifestyle changes, such as higher risk of hepatitis B and C infections. Administer a single dose of HPV vaccine (Option B): The HPV vaccine requires a series of doses (typically three) for full efficacy. Administering only a single dose is not sufficient for adequate protection. Perform serologic testing before initiating the HPV vaccine series (Option D): Serologic testing is not required before starting the HPV vaccine series.

      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: B) Administer all age-appropriate vaccines immediately Explanation: Children with unknown or undocumented immunization histories should be considered at risk and vaccinated without delay based on their current age. This ensures they receive protection against vaccine-preventable diseases as soon as possible. Vaccination of Children with Unknown or No Immunisation History: Consider Susceptible : Children with unknown or undocumented immunization history should be considered at risk for vaccine-preventable diseases and vaccinated without delay. Safety of Vaccination : Administering vaccines to children who are already immune is not harmful. Age-Based Immunisation : The immunization schedule should be tailored to the child's current age, ensuring all age-appropriate vaccines are administered promptly. Catch-Up Schedule : Refer to the catch-up immunization schedules for children aged 4 months through 18 years. These schedules specify the minimum age for the first dose and the minimum intervals between doses. Options for Addressing Concerns about Previous Vaccinations: Option Description 1. Administer or Repeat Missing Doses Ensures full protection by completing the vaccine series. 2. Perform Serologic Tests If tests show no antibodies, vaccinate according to the recommended schedule. Delay vaccination until the immunization history is confirmed (Option A): Delaying vaccination is not recommended because it leaves the child susceptible to vaccine-preventable diseases. Immediate vaccination should be prioritized when the immunization history is unknown. Administer only the first dose of each vaccine and wait for serologic confirmation (Option D): Administering only the first dose and waiting for serologic results is not the best practice. Vaccination should not be delayed, and the child should receive the full age-appropriate schedule as soon as possible to ensure protection.

        "D": "Administer all scheduled vaccines except OPV due to the previous vomiting episode."
      },
      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: A) Administer all scheduled vaccines, including a repeat dose of OPV. Explanation: This is the correct option because mild illness, such as a cough or cold, is not a contraindication for vaccination. Also, since the child vomited within 30 minutes of the last OPV dose, a repeat dose should be given today. Special case scenarios: Scenario Key Points A child with a Cough/Cold Mild illness (cough, cold, mild fever, mild diarrhoea) is not a contraindication to vaccination. Vaccination is safe for children with mild symptoms. Children with moderate to severe illness requiring hospitalization should not be vaccinated. Child with Vomiting If vomiting occurs within 10 minutes after OPV, repeat the dose immediately. For vomiting within 30 minutes after OPV, a repeat dose is recommended. Oral vaccines should be withheld in a child with recurrent vomiting until controlled. Lapsed Immunization Longer intervals between doses usually do not reduce final antibody levels. Vaccines should be administered as close to recommended intervals as possible. Full protection is achieved after completing the recommended doses. The interruption usually does not require restarting the series (exceptions: oral typhoid vaccine). Preponed Immunization Doses given 5+ days early are invalid and should be repeated. Repeat doses should follow the recommended minimum interval after the invalid dose. For doses before the minimum age, repeat after reaching the minimum age. For live vaccines, wait at least 28 days before repeating. Withhold all vaccines and reschedule for when the child is symptom-free (Option B): This is not recommended because mild symptoms like a cough or cold do not justify delaying vaccinations. Restart the entire vaccination series from the beginning (Option C): This is unnecessary. Interrupted or delayed vaccination schedules generally do not require restarting the series. The child can continue with the existing schedule, ensuring they receive all due doses. Administer all scheduled vaccines except OPV due to the previous vomiting episode (Option D): While OPV might be delayed in cases of uncontrolled vomiting, this child only vomited once, 15 minutes after the previous dose, which warrants a repeat dose rather than skipping it.
