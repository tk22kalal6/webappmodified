      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: B) Ability to compare objects Explanation: When a child transfers an object from one hand to another, it signifies their ability to compare objects that appear at 6 months. Visual motor coordination (Option A) refers to using visual input to direct hand movements, such as reaching for objects, which typically develops around 4 months. For handling small objects (Option C), thumb finger grasp should have been developed, which develops at 8 months of age. Voluntary release (Option D) typically refers to a disappearance of palmar grasp, which occurs at 4 months of age.

      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "movements in a specific area of the body. These seizures typically involve one part of the body, such as an arm, leg, or face, and can be repetitive and rhythmic in nature. The movements are usually brief and may occur in clusters. Incorrect Option Option A . Focal tonic seizure: Focal tonic seizures are characterized by sustained muscle contractions or stiffening of a specific body part. This does not match the observed movements in the neonate. Option C . Spasms: Spasms, also known as infantile spasms or West syndrome, are a specific type of seizure characterized by sudden, brief, and symmetric muscle contractions. These contractions typically involve the trunk and limbs and may cause a characteristic head drop or bending forward. The observed movements in the neonate do not resemble spasms. Option D . Subtle seizure: Subtle seizures, also known as non-convulsive seizures or electroclinical seizures, are seizures that do not have obvious clinical manifestations. They may manifest as subtle changes in behavior, eye movements, or body tone. However, the observed movements in the neonate are more consistent with focal clonic seizures than subtle seizures.

        "C": "Sweating and tachycardia",
        "D": "Decorticate and decerebrate posturing"
      },
      "correct_answer": "D",
      "explanation": "patients with severe brain injury, but they are not typically seen in brain death. In brain death, there is a complete loss of cerebral and brainstem function, including motor responses. Therefore, the absence of decorticate and decerebrate posturing is consistent with brain death. Incorrect Option Option A . Normal blood pressure without pharmacological support: In brain death, the autonomic centers in the brain that regulate blood pressure and heart rate are typically affected. As a result, maintaining normal blood pressure without the need for pharmacological support is not observed in brain-dead patients. Hypotension or instability of blood pressure requiring vasopressor support is more commonly seen. Option B . Positive spinal reflexes on stimulation: Brain death is characterized by the irreversible loss of all cerebral and brainstem functions. While the brainstem reflexes may still be present and may include spinal reflexes, they do not override the absence of higher brain functions. Therefore, positive spinal reflexes on stimulation are observed in brain death and are not a differentiating feature. Option C . Sweating and tachycardia: Sweating and tachycardia are autonomic responses regulated by the brainstem. In brain death, the disruption of the autonomic centers in the brainstem leads to the loss of these responses. Therefore, sweating and tachycardia are not seen in brain-dead patients and can help support the diagnosis. Reference: .",

      "question": "A 7-year-old child from a socioeconomically disadvantaged background has presented with fever, convulsions, and unusual behavior over the past two months, and has now become unresponsive to their parents for the past two days. On examination, the child exhibits neck stiffness, and their cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis reveals an elevated number of lymphocytes, glucose levels of 30 mg%, and protein levels of 300 mg%.

        "D": "Partially treated bacterial meningitis"
      },
      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: C) Tubercular meningitis Explanation: The clinical manifestations indicate tubercular meningitis based on the subacute presentation over two months and characteristic CSF findings. The combination of prolonged symptoms (fever, convulsions, behavioral changes), socioeconomically disadvantaged background (increasing TB risk), and CSF profile showing lymphocytic pleocytosis, markedly low glucose (30 mg%), and significantly elevated protein (300 mg%) are classic for tubercular meningitis. This pattern reflects the chronic inflammatory process typical of tuberculosis infection. CSF Findings Comparison: Type Pressure Cells Sugar Protein Gross physical appearance of CSF Acute bacterial meningitis + >1000 PMN ↓ + Turbid Tubercular meningitis + >100-1000 lymphocytes ↓ ++ Straw-colored Viral meningitis + 50-500 lymphocytes Normal + Normal or turbid Viral meningitis (Option A) typically presents with an acute onset and self-limiting course. While it shows lymphocytic predominance in CSF, glucose levels remain normal, and protein elevation is mild. Bacterial meningitis (Option B) characteristically presents with an acute onset (hours to days), and CSF analysis typically shows neutrophilic predominance rather than lymphocytes Partially treated bacterial meningitis (Option D) might show some modification in CSF findings, but would still typically have a more acute presentation and some neutrophils in CSF. The prolonged symptom duration and clear lymphocytic predominance make this diagnosis unlikely. Reference: Ghai Essential Pediatrics, 10th Edition, Page 585-589",

        "A": "Diazepam",
        "B": "Phenytoin",
        "C": "Phenobarbital",
        "D": "Thiopentone sodium"
      },
      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer A- Diazepam Explanation: The patient is experiencing Status epilepticus , which occurs when seizures continue for >30 minutes . The American Epilepsy Society SE Guidelines recommend using either intravenous lorazepam, rectal diazepam, or intravenous/intramuscular midazolam as a first-line agent. Management of Status Epilepticus: Status epilepticus is a medical emergency characterized by continuous seizure activity or recurrent seizures without recovery of consciousness between episodes. The definition has evolved to recognize the importance of early intervention: Traditional definition: seizures lasting >30 minutes Current definition: continuous seizures lasting ≥ 5 minutes, or two or more seizures without full recovery between them Early intervention is critical as neuronal damage can begin to occur after 5-30 minutes of continuous seizure activity. Initial Assessment and Stabilization (0-5 minutes) Stabilize airway, breathing, and circulation Position patient appropriately to maintain open airway Assess oxygenation and provide oxygen via nasal cannula/mask Monitor vital signs continuously Consider intubation if respiratory assistance is needed Initial assessment Perform quick neurological exam if possible Check blood glucose levels (treat if <60 mg/dl) Secure IV access Laboratory tests to obtain Electrolytes, hematology, toxicology screen Anticonvulsant drug levels (if on medication) First-Line Treatment (5-20 minutes) A benzodiazepine is the initial therapy of choice: Intravenous lorazepam : 0.1 mg/kg up to maximum of 4 mg, may repeat in 5-10 min Intravenous midazolam : 0.2 mg/kg up to 10 mg total dose, may repeat in 5-10 min Intramuscular midazolam : 0.2 mg/kg (if IV access not available) Rectal diazepam : 0.5 mg/kg (if IV access not available) Buccal midazolam : 0.5 mg/kg (if IV access not available) Second-Line Treatment (20-40 minutes) If seizures continue after benzodiazepine administration, proceed to one of these options: Intravenous fosphenytoin : 20 mg PE/kg loading dose (maximum 1500 mg/dose) Intravenous valproate : 40 mg/kg loading dose (maximum 3000 mg/dose) Intravenous levetiracetam : 30-60 mg/kg loading dose (maximum 4500 mg/dose) Intravenous phenobarbital : 15-20 mg/kg loading dose (if not given initially) Third-Line Treatment (40-60 minutes) If seizures still continue (refractory status epilepticus): Consider repeating second-line therapy Consider anesthetic doses of: Thiopental Midazolam Pentobarbital Propofol (with caution in children due to propofol infusion syndrome risk) Continuous EEG monitoring is recommended at this stage. Incorrect Options: Phenytoin (Option B): Phenytoin (or its prodrug fosphenytoin) is considered as a second-line therapy to be used if seizures continue after benzodiazepine administration (20-40 minute during the second therapy phase Phenobarbital (Option C): While phenobarbital can be used in status epilepticus, it's typically considered a second-line agent according to the standard protocl . It is to be used only in cases if first line pharmacological agents have failed. Thiopentone sodium (Option D): Thiopental (thiopentone) is a third-line agent for refractory status epilepticus (40-60 minute during the third therapy phase. It is used only when first and second-line treatments have failed.",

      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "transmission of Toxoplasma gondii from mother to fetus. The classic triad of symptoms includes intracranial calcifications (diffuse), chorioretinitis, and hydrocephalus. This combination strongly suggests congenital toxoplasmosis. Incorrect Options: Option B - Dandy-Walker Malformation: Dandy-Walker malformation is a congenital brain malformation involving the cerebellum and the fluid-filled spaces around it. It typically presents with hydrocephalus, posterior fossa cyst, and cerebellar hypoplasia, but it does not typically involve intracranial diffuse calcifications or chorioretinitis. Option C - Budd-Chiari Syndrome: Budd-Chiari syndrome involves hepatic venous outflow obstruction, leading to liver-related symptoms like ascites, hepatomegaly, and abdominal pain. It is unrelated to intracranial calcifications, chorioretinitis, or hydrocephalus, making it an unlikely diagnosis in this scenario. Option D - Congenital Hydrocephalus: Congenital hydrocephalus refers to an abnormal buildup of cerebrospinal fluid in the brain's ventricles, leading to increased intracranial pressure. While hydrocephalus is a feature here, the presence of diffuse intracranial calcifications and chorioretinitis is not typical of congenital hydrocephalus alone, making it less likely as the correct diagnosis.",

      "question": "A young child with congenital hydrocephalus was treated with a successful ventriculoperitoneal (VP) shunt. Four months post-surgical repair, the child presented with fever, nuchal rigidity, and irritability. Suspecting meningitis, which of the following is the next best step of management?",
      "options": {
        "A": "Wait and watch",
        "B": "Check shunt patency by nuclear study",
        "C": "Blood culture and take CSF sample from shunt tap",
        "D": "Blood culture and take CSF sample by lumbar puncture"
      },
      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer C - Blood culture and take CSF sample from shunt tap In cases where a child with a ventriculoperitoneal (VP) shunt presents with symptoms, suggestive of meningitis, obtaining a CSF sample from the shunt tap is the preferred method to evaluate for infection, as it involves accessing the shunt reservoir and collecting CSF directly from it. The shunt tap procedure allows for a more accurate assessment of CSF infection, as it is more likely to reflect the current status of the shunt system. Additionally, blood cultures should also be obtained to identify any potential bloodstream infection. Shunt-related meningitis: Most common complication of the CSF shunts. Most frequently caused by Staphylococcus epidermidis. Diagnosed by “Shunt tapping” (direct aspiration of the shunt). Management: Antibiotic therapy and shunt removal. Complications of CSF Shunt: Shunt occlusion Manifesting as headache, papilledema, vomiting, altered mental status. Bacterial infections, caused by coagulase-negative staphylococci (CoNS), most commonly by S. epidermidis. This may result in the following: Meningitis (fever, headache, irritability) Peritonitis (fever, abdominal tenderness, distention, pain) Wound infection (erythema, swelling, discharge, or dehiscence along the shunt tract and most often occurs within days to weeks of the surgical procedure) Wait and watch (Option A) is not appropriate in this case, as prompt evaluation and treatment are necessary for suspected meningitis as it is life threatening. Check shunt patency by nuclear study (Option B): While shunt malfunction is a possibility in a child with a VP shunt, the symptoms described are more suggestive of an infection. Checking shunt patency may be a consideration, but it is not the most urgent next step. Blood culture and taking a CSF sample by lumbar puncture (Option D) is not the preferred choice because obtaining CSF from the shunt tap provides a more direct and specific assessment of the shunt system.

      },
      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer C - Midazolam The first-line drug used to control febrile seizures is midazolam . Febrile Seizures: Definition : Seizures occurring in children (6 months to 5 years) with fever (>38°C), without underlying neurological issues or prior unprovoked seizures. Causes : Can be triggered by upper respiratory infections, gastroenteritis, viral exanthem, bacterial infections, malaria, or immunization. This must be distinguished from seizures caused by intracranial infection or those triggered by fever in children with epilepsy. Types of Febrile Seizures: Simple Febrile Seizure: Generalized seizure lasting <15 minutes. Occurs once within 24 hours during a fever in a neurologically normal child. Complex Febrile Seizure: Accounts for 15-20% of cases. Characterized by focal signs, seizure duration >15 minutes, or multiple seizures during the same febrile illness. Febrile Status Epilepticus: Seizure lasts >30 minutes. Prolonged seizure with significant risk. Risk Factors for Recurrence: Age <18 months Family history of febrile seizures Multiple seizures in the first episode Seizure at a low temperature (<40°C) Management of Febrile Seizures: Acute Management at Home: Use nasal midazolam or rectal diazepam to stop the seizure. Hospital Management (Status Epilepticus): Follow standard protocols for status epilepticus. Maintain airway, breathing and circulation. IV Lorazepam (0.1 mg/kg) or midazolam (0.1 mg/kg) is administered If seizures persist, IV phenytoin (Option B) or Fosphenytoin is given Later drugs like IV sodium valproate (Option A) , levetiracetam, phenobarbitone (Option D) , and midazolam infusions are used for persistent seizures. In non-responsive cases, IV ketamine and oral topiramate are considered. Lumbar Puncture: Indicated in cases where meningitis is suspected (especially in younger children or those who have already received antibiotics or unvaccinated children). Prophylaxis for Recurrence: Indications for Prophylaxis: Children with risk factors for recurrence Frequent recurrences (2 in 6 months or 4 in 1 year). Medications: Oral benzodiazepines (e.g., diazepam 0.6-0.8 mg/kg/day or clobazam 0.8-1 mg/kg/day). Start at the first sign of fever and continue for the first 48 hours to reduce recurrence by 80%.

      "explanation": "Correct Answer D - Spina bifida Spina bifida is a neural tube defect (NTD) caused by failure of the neural tube to close properly during embryonic development. This condition is strongly associated with maternal folic acid deficiency. Types of Neural tube defects: Category Details Definition Failure of proper closure of neural tube & covering mesoderm/ectoderm; most common congenital CNS anomaly. Inheritance Primary NTDs have multifactorial inheritance. Maternal risk factors Alcohol, radiation exposure, IDDM, valproate, carbamazepine, zinc and folate deficiency. Types of NTDs Spina bifida occulta, meningocele, encephalocele, myelomeningocele, anencephaly, caudal regression syndrome, dermal sinus, tethered cord, syringomyelia, diastematomyelia, lipoma, iniencephaly. Spina bifida occulta Midline defect of vertebral bodies without protrusion of spinal cord or meninges ; usually asymptomatic and not of consequence. Craniorachischisis Rare malformation with skull and spinal bone defects ; brain and nerves exposed ; may have other defects like imperforate anus. Meningocele Meninges herniate through vertebral arches or sacrum; spinal cord norma l. Fluctuant midline mass that may transilluminate. Surgery may be delayed in asymptomatic cases with normal neuro findings and skin covering. Myelomeningocele Most common in lumbosacral region ; sac-like cystic structure with neural tissue; 80% develop hydrocephalus with type II Chiari malformation. Anencephaly Large defect of calvarium, meninges, and scalp; associated with rudimentary brain due to failure of closure of rostral neuropore. Iniencephaly Retroflexion of head with occipital and upper spine defects, nearly absent neck; defect can range from acrania to minimal defect. Prenatal diagnosis Detailed ultrasound, MSAFP (maternal serum α -fetoprotein), amniotic fluid acetylcholinesterase ( AChE ). Prevention 0.4 mg folic acid daily for all women of childbearing age ; 4 mg daily for high-risk women (prior affected child). Risk of recurrence 3-4% after 1 affected child; 10% after 2 affected children. Treatment Surgery for defect; VP shunt if hydrocephalus present. Open lesions should be closed within 24 hours. Antibiotics if infection is present. Cleft Lip and Palate (Option A): Caused by failure of fusion of the maxillary and medial nasal processes. Presents as facial deformities, not a spinal defect. Down Syndrome (Option B): Due to trisomy 21, characterized by: Facial dysmorphism (flat facial profile, upslanting palpebral fissures). Congenital heart defects (e.g., AV septal defect). Intellectual disability. No neural tube defects or spinal abnormalities. Gastroschisis (Option C): Congenital abdominal wall defect → intestines protrude without a membrane. No neural involvement.

      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer A - 6 Steroid resistance in nephrotic syndrome is diagnosed when there is no remission despite 6 weeks of treatment with daily corticosteroids. Steroid resistance in nephrotic syndrome is diagnosed when there is no remission despite 6 weeks of treatment with prednisolone (2 mg/kg/day). There are two types: Primary (initial) steroid resistance, where there is no response to steroids from the beginning Secondary (late) steroid resistance, which develops during relapse treatment. All steroid-resistant patients should undergo a kidney biopsy . Common findings include: FSGS (Focal Segmental Glomerulosclerosis) or MCD (Minimal Change Disease) Rarely, membranous nephropathy may be seen in older children Genetic Causes of Steroid Resistance : Genetic mutations in genes like NPHS2 (podocin), NPHS1 (nephrin), PLCE1, and others. Next-generation sequencing can help identify these mutations, which are linked to progressive kidney damage and a lower risk of recurrence after kidney transplantation. Management: The treatment focuses on inducing remission of proteinuria while minimizing medication side effects. Common treatment regimens include: Immunosuppressive agents like cyclosporine or tacrolimus (calcineurin inhibitors) Tapering doses of prednisolone ACE inhibitors like enalapril (0.3-0.6 mg/kg/day) or ramipril (6 mg/m²/day) help reduce proteinuria and control hypertension Partial remission (1-2+ proteinuria) is acceptable, with complete remission being the goal Most patients respond within 3-6 months For patients who cannot use calcineurin inhibitors, a regimen of 6 pulses of IV cyclophosphamide combined with alternate-day prednisolone can be considered Angiotensin Receptor Blockers (ARBs) like losartan and valsartan can be used as alternatives if a patient experiences persistent dry cough with ACE inhibitors HMG-Coenzyme-A Reductase Inhibitors (Statins) may be considered in patients with persistently elevated LDL (low-density lipoprotein) levels to manage hyperlipidemia Reference: Ghai Essential Pediatrics, 10th Edition, Page: 505, 506.",

      "explanation": "Typically occurs between 2 and 12 months of age. Genetics ARX Gene Mutations : In males, linked to ambiguous genitalia and cortical migration abnormalities. Types Cryptogenic (Unknown Etiology) : Normal development before onset. Symptomatic : Associated with developmental delays due to perinatal issues, brain malformations, metabolic disorders, or other causes. Clinical Features Infantile Epileptic Spasms : Clusters of spasms occurring mainly during drowsiness or upon waking. Developmental Regression Hypsarrhythmia on EEG : A chaotic, high-voltage background with multifocal spikes. Management First-Line Treatment: Hormonal therapy, primarily ACTH (80 mg/mL) Dosage : 150 units/m² daily (75 units/m² twice daily) for 2 weeks, then taper gradually. Monitoring : EEGs at 1, 2, and 4 weeks to assess response. Early intervention is crucial, as a delay beyond 3 weeks can worsen the prognosis. Alternative Treatments Oral Prednisolone : Lower-cost alternative (Less effective) Vigabatrin : Used as a first-line agent in West syndrome associated with tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) or second-line if hormonal therapy fails. Side effects include retinal toxicity. Ketogenic Diet : Considered a third-line therapy. Other Medications : Valproate, benzodiazepines (nitrazepam, clonazepam), topiramate, lamotrigine, zonisamide, pyridoxine, and IVIG. These drugs can help reduce seizure frequency and severity but are not uniformly effective and may be used alongside ACTH or vigabatrin in cases with incomplete response. Side Effects and Precautions Side Effects of Hormonal Therapy : Hypertension, electrolyte imbalance, infections, hyperglycemia, and gastric ulcers. Vaccination : Live vaccines are contraindicated, and other vaccines may be ineffective during and shortly after hormonal therapy. Juvenile myoclonic epilepsy (Option A) typically begins during adolescence and is characterized by morning myoclonic jerks, along with generalized tonic-clonic seizures and occasionally absence seizures. EEG findings include generalized 4-6 Hz spike-and-wave activity, often seen after waking. The most effective treatment is valproate , with alternatives such as levetiracetam, lamotrigine, or topiramate. Rolandic epilepsy (Option B) is a common and self-limiting childhood epilepsy. Seizures occur during sleep or upon waking and involve facial twitching, drooling, or temporary difficulty speaking, without loss of consciousness. Symptoms resolve naturally by adolescence. Treatment options include carbamazepine or oxcarbazepine. Lennox-Gastaut syndrome (Option D) typically affects children aged 2-10 years and includes developmental delay, a variety of seizure types (e.g., tonic, atonic, atypical absence), and an EEG pattern showing slow spike-and-wave discharges. Treatment often involves a combination of drugs such as valproate, lamotrigine, clobazam, or topiramate. Reference: Nelson Textbook of Pediatrics, 21st Edition, Page 3098,3103",

      "explanation": "Correct Answer: C) It is associated with facial angiofibroma Explanation: The given image shows discrete tan nodules on the iris, called Lisch nodules , which are a hallmark of Neurofibromatosis Type 1 (NF1) and are melanocytic hamartomas of the iris. Facial angiofibromas are a characteristic feature of Tuberous Sclerosis Complex (TSC), not NF1. Neurofibromatosis Type 1 (NF1): Incidence: 1 in 3,000 live births. Inheritance: 50% of cases are inherited from a parent. 50% due to spontaneous mutations. Genetics: Autosomal dominant loss-of-function mutations in the NF1 gene on chromosome 17q11.2. The gene encodes neurofibromin, which inhibits the oncogene Ras. Diagnosis Criteria (Two or more required): Feature Description Café-au-lait macules (CALMs) >5 mm in prepubertal, >15 mm in postpubertal. 6 or more needed for diagnosis Axillary/Inguinal Freckling Multiple hyperpigmented areas, 2-3 mm in diameter. Iris Lisch Nodules (Option D) Hamartomas in the iris (Option A) , best seen with a slit-lamp. 2 or more needed for diagnosis and doesn’t cause any visual disturbances. (Option B) Neurofibromas Two or more neurofibromas or one plexiform neurofibroma. Osseous Lesion Sphenoid dysplasia (which may cause pulsating exophthalmos) or cortical thinning of long bones with or without pseudoarthrosis (most often the tibia). Optic Gliomas CNS tumor affecting the optic nerve. Family History First-degree relative with an NF1 diagnosis based on these criteria. Management: Regular Monitoring Treatment Considerations: Avoid routine brain/optic tract imaging unless symptomatic. Selumetinib: Effective in children with inoperable plexiform neurofibromas . Neuropsychological and Educational Support. Genetic Counseling Inheritance: Autosomal dominant; over 50% of cases are de novo mutations. Molecular Testing: Useful in cases",

Incorrect Options: Option A - Basal Ganglia Calcifications: Basal ganglia calcifications are typically associated with metabolic and genetic disorders, such as Fahr’s disease, rather than with cerebral palsy or spastic quadriplegia. Option B - Periventricular Leukomalacia (PVL): PVL is associated with spastic diplegia, not quadriplegia. It involves damage to the white matter around the ventricles, commonly seen in premature infants, leading to motor control issues predominantly in the legs rather than all four limbs. Option C - Cerebellar Degeneration: Cerebellar degeneration usually presents with ataxia and balance issues rather than spastic quadriplegia. This condition involves the loss of neurons in the cerebellum, which is responsible for coordinating movement. Reference: .",
