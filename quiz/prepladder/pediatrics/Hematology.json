      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: C) Protein C deficiency Explanation: Phytomenadione (Vitamin K1) is routinely given to newborns to prevent hemorrhagic disease of the newborn (HDN), which occurs due to Vitamin K deficiency and can cause severe bleeding. However, its administration is contraindicated in newborns with Protein C deficiency, a rare inherited disorder that increases the risk of blood clots. In these infants, Vitamin K can exacerbate clotting, leading to (Purpura fulminans) a life-threatening condition characterized by widespread blood clots and tissue necrosis. But in most cases , as Protein C deficiency would go undiagnosed at birth, Vitamin K birth dose is almost always given. Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency (Option A): This genetic disorder affects red blood cells and can lead to hemolytic anemia when exposed to triggers like certain medications. Vitamin K does not cause oxidative stress or hemolysis in G6PD deficiency. Alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency (Option B): This genetic disorder can lead to lung and liver disease but does not affect the safety of Vitamin K administration in newborns. Cystic fibrosis (Option D): This genetic disorder affects the lungs and digestive system, leading to malabsorption of fat-soluble vitamins like Vitamin K. Newborns with cystic fibrosis often need Vitamin K supplementation, making its administration necessary rather than contraindicated.

      "explanation": "Correct Answer: D) t(9;22) Explanation: t(12;21) (ETV6-RUNX1 fusion) is specific to B-cell Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia (ALL) , particularly in children. It is associated with a favorable prognosis in ALL. However, because it only occurs in ALL , and never in AML , it does not help in differentiating the two. A translocation that is exclusive to one lineage does not assist in differential diagnosis , which requires markers that can be seen in either AML or ALL. Thus, t(12;21) is not useful in distinguishing AML from ALL , as it is seen only in ALL and cannot be used to differentiate the two. t(8;21) (option A) : Is associated with AML , particularly the M2 subtype (AML with maturation) . Involves the RUNX1-RUNX1T1 (AML1-ETO) fusion gene. Helps in identifying AML cases with better prognosis and distinct lineage . Useful in differentiating AML from ALL because it is exclusive to AML. t(15;17) (option B) : Characteristic of Acute Promyelocytic Leukemia (APL), an M3 subtype of AML . Leads to formation of the PML-RARA fusion gene. It is pathognomonic for APL , which requires specific treatment (e.g., ATRA). Helps in differentiating AML from ALL , as this translocation is not seen in ALL . t(9;22) (option D) : Known as the Philadelphia chromosome . Seen in: ALL (mainly adult B-ALL) Chronic Myeloid Leukemia (CML) Rarely in AML While it occurs in multiple leukemias, its presence in ALL vs AML helps subclassify and direct targeted therapy (e.g., imatinib).

Inheritance Genetic Pattern : Hemophilia A is inherited in an X-linked recessive pattern. It predominantly affects males. Symptoms Bleeding Characteristics : Individuals with Hemophilia A commonly experience spontaneous bleeding, particularly into joints (hemarthrosis) and muscles, which can lead to pain, swelling, and long-term joint damage. Prolonged Bleeding : They may also have prolonged bleeding following injuries or surgeries. Diagnosis Blood Tests : Diagnosis is confirmed through blood tests that measure the activity of factor VIII. Haemophilia A is associated with a prolonged activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) and a normal prothrombin time (PT).

        "D": "Fibrinogen level"
      },
      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: A) Hageman factor (Factor XII) assay Explanation: Factor XII deficiency is a rare coagulation disorder that may present with delayed umbilical cord separation in newborns. Although it typically does not lead to bleeding, it can be linked to thrombotic complications. Since Factor XII plays a key role in the intrinsic pathway of the coagulation cascade, assessing the Hageman factor (Factor XII) is essential for diagnosis. Causes of delayed umbilical cord separation Cause Mechanism Leukocyte Adhesion Deficiency (LAD) Neutrophils fail to adhere and migrate to infection sites, impairing cord separation. Neutrophil Dysfunction Disorders like chronic granulomatous disease impair neutrophil function, delaying cord detachment. Prematurity Underdeveloped immune responses in premature infants delay inflammatory and necrotic processes. Infections (e.g., Neonatal Sepsis) Systemic infections impair healing, leading to delayed cord separation. Hypothyroidism Congenital hypothyroidism slows metabolic and healing processes, delaying cord detachment. Umbilical Cord Care Practices Use of antiseptics (e.g., alcohol, chlorhexidine) on the cord stump slows desiccation and separation. Congenital Immunodeficiency Syndromes Conditions like SCID impair immune function, delaying healing and cord separation. Factor XII Deficiency Impaired clot formation and tissue remodeling delay wound healing and cord separation. Prothrombin Time (PT) (Option B): PT assesses the extrinsic and common coagulation pathways. It’s not the primary test for diagnosing Factor XII deficiency. Activated Partial Thromboplastin Time (aPTT) (Option C): aPTT measures the intrinsic and common pathways, often prolonged in Factor XII deficiency. However, a specific Factor XII assay is required for a definitive diagnosis. Fibrinogen level (Option D): Fibrinogen is crucial for clot formation. Measuring its levels helps diagnose fibrinogen-related disorders but isn’t directly related to Factor XII deficiency.

      "question": "A 15-year-old male presents with a history of chronic fatigue, frequent nosebleeds, and recurrent infections over the past few months. His laboratory results show pancytopenia and peripheral blood smear reveals markedly reduced cellularity without evidence of blasts or dysplasia. A bone marrow biopsy demonstrates severe hypocellularity with less than 10% hematopoietic cells and prominent fatty infiltration. Based on these findings, which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?",

      },
      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: C) Aplastic anemia Explanation: The severe pancytopenia with a hypocellular marrow with fatty infiltration strongly points towards aplastic anemia rather than other marrow failure syndromes. Aplastic anemia is characterized by the suppression of two or all three hematopoietic cell lines (RBCs, WBCs, platelets). Clinical features: severe anemia reveals pallor and/or signs of congestive heart failure and bleeding tendencies. Fever, pneumonia or sepsis are due to neutropenia. Investigations: Peripheral blood smear findings show anemia, the RBCs show macrocytosis (>100fl), thrombocytopenia and neutropenia. Bone marrow aspiration and biopsy are essential for diagnosis and evaluation of severity. The marrow cells are replaced with fat cells and lymphocytes , with very few hematopoietic cells. Acute myeloid leukemia (Option A): AML typically presents with pancytopenia, but the absence of blasts in this patient’s smear makes AML unlikely. Additionally, the bone marrow in AML would be hypercellular rather than hypocellular. Myelodysplastic syndrome (Option B): MDS can present with pancytopenia and hypocellular marrow, but it is usually associated with dysplastic changes in the hematopoietic cells and the presence of abnormal cells in the bone marrow. Fanconi anemia (Option D): Fanconi anemia is a genetic disorder that leads to bone marrow failure, but it usually presents earlier in childhood with additional congenital abnormalities such as absent radius and short stature.",

      },
      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "abdominal pain along with the history of multiple blood transfusions along with absence of spleen hints towards the diagnosis of sickle cell disease. Sickle cell anemia is an autosomal recessive disease that results from the substitution of valine for glutamic acid at position 6 of the beta-globin gene. Sickled red blood cells lead to the obstruction of the microcirculation, causing ischaemic injury and resulting in progressive damage and eventual loss of splenic function . This leads to an increased risk of infections, particularly from encapsulated organisms such as Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae and Neisseira meningitidis. Beta-thalassemia major (Option A) usually causes severe anemia but doesn’t typically result in spleen absence. Hereditary spherocytosis (Option B) often presents with splenomegaly. Autoimmune hemolytic anemia (Option D) can cause anemia, jaundice and splenomegaly. Learning Objective: Types of crises in sickle cell disease Vaso-occlusive crisis Caused by obstruction of the microcirculation by sickled RBCs Acute chest syndrome Caused by vaso-occlusive crisis involving the lungs Sequestration crisis (spleen or liver) Obstruction of splenic veins causes sequestration of peripheral blood in an engorged spleen Infectious crisis Caused by increased susceptibility to infection by encapsulated organisms Aplastic crisis Results from cessation of erythropoiesis in the bone marrow, usually following infections Reference: Ghai Essential Pediatrics (10th edition), page 364",

      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: C) High-dose folic acid supplementation Explanation: Doses of folate >0.1 mg can correct the anemia of vitamin B12 deficiency but might aggravate any associated neurological abnormalities therefore high doses of folic acid supplementation should be avoided in a child Megaloblastic Anemia: Type of macrocytic anemia with MCV>90 - 100 fL. Due to Vit B12 or folate deficiency. Vit B12 deficiency causes Folate deficiency causes Pure vegetarian vegan diet Exclusive feeding with goat’s milk Pernicious anemia Drugs inhibiting folate metabolism Antifolates (e.g., methotrexate), Pyrimethamine; trimethoprim, Sulfasalazine, Valproic acid Malabsorption: Crohn's disease, chronic pancreatitis Cerebral folate deficiency (genetic or acquired) Metabolic: homocystinuria Defects in absorption: Gastric achlorhydria, Diseases of the upper small intestine- Tropical sprue Clinical features: Pallor Smooth, beefy red tongue Hepatosplenomegaly Hyperpigmented knuckle On Peripheral smear: Macroovalocytes Hypersegmented neutrophils (>5 lobes in 5% neutrophils). Treatment: When the diagnosis of folate deficiency is established, folic acid may be administered orally or parenterally at 0.5-1.0 mg/day. (Options A and B) If the specific diagnosis is in doubt, smaller doses of folate (0.1 mg/day) may be used for 1 week as a diagnostic test, because a hematologic response can be expected within 72 hr. Folic acid therapy (0.5-1.0 mg/day) should be continued for 3-4 weeks until a definite hematologic response has occurred. Maintenance therapy with a multivitamin (containing 0.2 mg of folate) is adequate. Encouraging a diet rich in folate is beneficial and supports overall treatment for folate deficiency. It is a complementary approach to oral folic acid supplementation and does not pose a risk. (Option D)",

      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Correct answer: B) Increase in the reticulocyte count Explanation: An increase in the reticulocyte count is observed on the 3rd day of iron therapy. An increase in reticulocyte count can be an early indicator of effective iron therapy, as the bone marrow responds to the increased availability of iron by producing more red blood cells. If the anemia is mild , the blood count can be repeated approximately 1 month after initiating therapy. At this point, the hemoglobin has usually risen by at least 1-2 g/dL and has often normalized. If the anemia is more severe, earlier confirmation of the diagnosis can be made by the appearance of a reticulocytosis, usually within 48-96 hr of instituting treatment. The hemoglobin will then begin to increase by 0.1-0.4 g/dL/day depending on the severity of the anemia. Iron medication should be continued for 2-3 months after blood values normalize to re-establish iron stores. Response to treatment in iron deficiency anemia: Time after iron administration Response Within 24 hours Decreased irritability, improved appetite (Option C) 48-76 hours Reticulocytosis appears to peak at 5-7 days post-treatment. 1-4 weeks Hb level becomes normal (Option A ruled out) 2-3 months Replenishment of stores (Option D) Iron deficiency anemia The most common condition causing anemia in children.
