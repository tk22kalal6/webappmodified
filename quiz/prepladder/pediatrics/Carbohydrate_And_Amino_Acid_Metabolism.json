      "question": "A 5-day-old newborn presents with poor feeding, vomiting, and jaundice. Physical examination reveals hepatomegaly and cataracts. Laboratory tests show elevated liver enzymes, hypoglycemia, and a positive reducing substance in the urine. Which of the following is the most appropriate initial management step?",
      "options": {
        "A": "Start phototherapy for jaundice",
        "B": "Administer intravenous glucose",
        "C": "Discontinue all lactose-containing foods",
        "D": "Begin enzyme replacement therapy"
      },
      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: C) Discontinue all lactose-containing foods (lactose = glucose + galactose) reducing substance in urine in a child less than 6 months of age is consistent with a diagnosis of galactosemia , an inborn error of galactose metabolism. Lactose is a disaccharide made up of glucose and galactose. The most critical initial step in management is to remove the source of galactose , which is lactose from milk (including breast milk) and milk products. Ruling out Hereditary Fructose Intolerance: If the clinical scenario describes a child older than 6 months, Hereditary Fructose Intolerance (HFI) can be ruled out. HFI presents with symptoms like vomiting, lethargy, seizures, and hypoglycemia after introduction of fructose-containing foods . Cataracts are not a feature of HFI but strongly indicate galactosemia , due to accumulation of galactitol . Liver findings are common in both HFI and galactosemia, but HFI symptoms arise after fructose intake. Renal tubular acidosis or Fanconi syndrome may occur in HFI due to proximal tubular dysfunction following fructose ingestion. Galactosemia Enzyme Deficiency Galactose-1-phosphate uridylyltransferase (GALT) - Classical type Galactokinase- benign disease with only oil drop cataract. Epimerase- SNHL + symptoms of classical type (Low galactose-based diet can be given which is contraindicated in the classical type) Pathophysiology Accumulation of galactose-1-phosphate (toxic causing jaundice, and liver damage) Inability to metabolize galactose from milk Damage to liver, kidney, and brain Clinical Features Hepatic: Jaundice, hepatomegaly GI: Vomiting, diarrhea, failure to thrive CNS: Seizures, intellectual disability Eyes: Oil drop cataracts Increased risk of E. coli sepsis Diagnosis Reducing substance in urine (positive)( Positive Benedict test but negative glucose oxidase test) Direct enzyme (GALT) assay Genetic testing (Perinatal diagnosis is possible) Management Lactose-free diet Breast Milk contraindicated Soy-based or elemental formulas Calcium supplementation Start phototherapy for jaundice (Option A): Phototherapy may help with jaundice but doesn't address the underlying metabolic problem. Administer intravenous glucose (Option B): While intravenous glucose might help with hypoglycemia, it doesn't address the primary issue of galactose toxicity. Begin enzyme replacement therapy (Option D): Enzyme replacement therapy is not currently available for galactosemia. Reference: Nelson Textbook of Paediatrics, 21st Edition, Pages 788, 789",

      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "β -synthase Correct Answer: B) Cystathionine β -synthase Explanation: The patient's presentation is consistent with homocystinuria , which is caused by a deficiency of cystathionine β -synthase (CBS) . The clinical features described- tall stature, elongated limbs, pectus excavatum, blue eyes, developmental delay, and lens dislocation (ectopia lentis) are typical of this disorder.

This is because MTHFR deficiency leads to THF deficiency causing less conversion of homocysteine to methionine. Additionally, MTHFR deficiency doesn't cause the characteristic ocular and skeletal features described in this patient. Methionine synthase (Option D): Deficiency of this enzyme can cause homocystinuria, but it's typically associated with low methionine levels and methylmalonic aciduria if B12 deficiency is present.",

        "D": "Initiate valproate for seizure prophylaxis"
      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: B) Administer intravenous sodium ammonium benzoate and arginine Explanation: A 2-day-old neonate presenting with poor feeding, vomiting, lethargy, severe hyperammonemia (plasma ammonia 800 µmol/L), and respiratory alkalosis suggests a severe urea cycle disorder. The most appropriate immediate management is administering intravenous sodium benzoate and arginine. Sodium ammonium benzoate is a nitrogen-scavenging agent that helps reduce ammonia levels by providing an alternative pathway for nitrogen excretion. Arginine is essential in most UCDs (except arginase deficiency) as it helps drive the urea cycle and promotes ammonia removal. This combination is part of the standard emergency protocol for managing acute hyperammonemia in suspected UCDs. Valproate is contraindicated as it suppresses urea cycle enzymes. Clinical Features: In newborns, symptoms may include CNS toxicity, seizures, neuropathy, nausea, vomiting, and raised ICP. Diagnosis: The key diagnostic marker for UCDs is hyperammonemia . Management: Acute management of hyperammonemia is critical and includes: 1. Providing adequate calories through IV glucose and lipids while temporarily restricting protein intake. 2. Administer medications to remove ammonia, such as sodium benzoate and sodium phenylacetate. 3. Supplementing with arginine or citrulline (except in arginase deficiency). 4. In severe cases, use hemodialysis or peritoneal dialysis to rapidly lower ammonia levels. Start a protein-based diet (Option A) : This would be harmful in UCD as it would increase nitrogen load, exacerbating hyperammonemia. UCDs require protein restriction, not increased protein intake. Perform exchange transfusion (Option C) : While this might temporarily lower ammonia levels, it's not the first-line treatment for hyperammonemia in UCDs. More effective and less invasive methods (like medication and dietary management) are preferred initially. Initiate valproate for seizure prophylaxis (Option D) : While seizures can occur in UCDs due to hyperammonemia. Valproate is contraindicated as it suppresses urea cycle enzymes.

      "correct_answer": "D",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: D) Start a leucine-restricted diet and provide thiamine supplementation Explanation: The symptoms described for the 5-day-old neonate—poor feeding, lethargy, a sweet, maple syrup-like odor in the urine, metabolic acidosis, and ketonuria—are indicative of Maple Syrup Urine Disease (MSUD) . The most appropriate next step in management is to start a leucine-restricted diet and provide thiamine supplementation. Restricting leucine (and other branched-chain amino acids) helps reduce the accumulation of toxic metabolites. Thiamine supplementation is beneficial as it's a cofactor for the deficient enzyme complex and can enhance residual enzyme activity in some patients. Maple Syrup Urine Disease (MSUD): MSUD affects the catabolic pathway of branched-chain amino acids (leucine, isoleucine, and valine). Syrup Urine Disease\" data-author=\"\" data-hash=\"939\" data-license=\"\" data-source=\"\" data-tags=\"March2025\" src=\"https://image.prepladder.com/notes/N5bdUL8fnIngzjm9lmsU1742036005.png\" /> BCKD - Branched-Chain α -Keto Acid Dehydrogenase Complex is deficient in MSUD . It has the following components: E1: Decarboxylase (E1 α , E1 β ), E2: Dihydrolipoyl Transacylase, E3: Dihydrolipoyl Dehydrogenase. Enzyme complex is responsible for oxidative decarboxylation of BCAA, pyruvate, and alpha-ketoglutarate and hence thiamine is a coenzyme of BCKD enzyme, PDH, and alpha KGD enzymes. Clinical Features: Metabolic acidosis CNS toxicity ( due to alpha ketoisocaproate) Developmental delay Maple syrup smell of urine and sweat Diagnosis: Newborn screening: Elevated BCAAs, particularly leucine, on tandem mass spectrometry. Plasma amino acid analysis: Elevated leucine, Alloisoleucine, and valine. Urine organic acid analysis: Presence of BCKAs and their metabolites. Enzyme assay: Reduced BCKD complex activity in cultured fibroblasts or lymphocytes. Management: Acute management: Dietary restriction of BCAA. Careful supplementation of isoleucine and valine. Hemodialysis or hemofiltration in severe cases. Long-term management: Lifelong dietary restriction of BCAAs, particularly leucine. Regular monitoring of plasma amino acid levels. Thiamine supplementation (responsive in some patients). Liver transplantation may be considered in severe cases. A ketogenic (keto) die t (Option A) involves high-fat and low-carbohydrate intake, which leads to the production of ketone bodies. In MSUD, the goal is to limit the intake of BCAAs, which cannot be adequately metabolized. A keto diet would not address the underlying metabolic defect and could worsen the metabolic acidosis and ketonuria seen in MSUD. Administer phenobarbital for seizure prophylaxis (Option B) : While seizures can occur in MSUD, prophylactic anticonvulsants are not routinely used.

      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: C) Urine succinylacetone test Explanation: The infant’s symptoms including prolonged jaundice, vomiting, failure to thrive, hepatomegaly, a distended abdomen, elevated liver enzymes, a low platelet count, and a distinctive \"cabbage-like\" odor to the urine suggest a diagnosis of tyrosinemia type I. Succinylacetone test: The presence of high succinylacetone in the blood or urine is a hallmark of tyrosinemia type 1 and confirms the diagnosis and it is responsible for hepatorenal failure and HCC. Types of Tyrosinemia: Types Type I Type II Type III Most common Due to deficiency of the enzyme Fumarylacetoacetate hydroxylase (FAH) FAA accumulates and converted to succinylacetone Cabbage odor urine Due to deficiency of enzyme tyrosine aminotransferase Clinical features: Palmar or plantar hyperkeratosis, corneal ulcers, and intellectual disability Least common Due to deficiency of enzyme 4-HPPD (4- Hydroxy Phenyl Pyruvate Dioxygenase) Also known as Hawkinsuria Swimming pool chlorine odor urine Tyrosinemia refers to a group of inherited metabolic disorders characterized by the body's inability to properly break down the amino acid tyrosine. Tyrosinemia Type 1: Cause: Autosomal recessive disorder due to a deficiency in fumarylacetoacetate hydrolase (FAH), leading to toxic succinylacetone accumulation, which harms the liver and kidneys. Symptoms: Infants: Hepatorenal failure and CNS toxicity. Diagnosis: Plasma Amino Acid Analysis: Elevated tyrosine, methionine, and phenylalanine. Alpha-Fetoprotein (AFP) Measurement: Elevated levels indicate the condition. Succinylacetone Test: High levels in blood or urine confirm the diagnosis. Genetic Testing: Identifies mutations in the FAH gene for definitive diagnosis. Treatment: Nitisinone (NTBC): Blocks tyrosine breakdown to prevent succinylacetone formation. Dietary Restriction: Limits intake of phenylalanine and tyrosine. Liver Transplant: Considered if there is liver failure, cancer, or inadequate response to NTBC. Urine culture and sensitivity (Option A): This test is used to identify urinary tract infections, which are not indicated by the infant’s symptoms or distinctive odor. Serum ammonia levels (Option B): Elevated ammonia levels are associated with urea cycle disorders, not Tyrosinemia Type 1. Urine glucose levels (Option D): While important in evaluating metabolic status, urine glucose levels are not specific for diagnosing Tyrosinemia Type 1.

On examination, the physician notes bluish-black discoloration in the sclerae and dark pigmentation in the cartilage of the ears. The mother mentions that the child's urine turns dark when left standing for a few hours. Based on these findings, what is the most likely diagnosis?",
      "options": {
        "A": "Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome",
        "B": "Alkaptonuria",
        "C": "Marfan Syndrome",
        "D": "Osteogenesis Imperfecta"
      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: B) Alkaptonuria Explanation: The patient's finding of urine darkening upon standing aligns with a hallmark symptom of alkaptonuria. Alkaptonuria is an autosomal recessive disorder caused by a deficiency in the enzyme homogentisate 1,2-dioxygenase (HGD) , also known as homogentisic acid oxidase . When HGD is deficient, HGA accumulates and is excreted in the urine, giving it a characteristic dark color upon standing due to oxidation. Other features like bluish-black discoloration in the sclerae and ear cartilage strongly suggest ochronosis, with black discoloration with ochre bodies in the dermis of the skin. The patient's chronic back pain and stiffness, which have worsened over time, are consistent with the involvement of intervertebral disc cartilage of spine commonly seen in alkaptonuria. Signs and Symptoms of Alkaptonuria: Darkening of Urine: Urine darkens to brown or black upon standing due to HGA oxidation. In infants, diaper staining may be the first sign. Ochronosis: Connective Tissues: Bluish-black discoloration in cartilage and collagen. Eyes: Dark pigment deposits in the sclera. Ears and Nose: Dark pigmentation in cartilage. Joints: HGA pigment causes cartilage degeneration, leading to osteoarthritis-like symptoms. Spine: Degeneration and calcification of intervertebral discs, causing back pain and stiffness. Large Joint Arthritis: Arthritis, especially in shoulders and hips, develops due to chronic inflammation and cartilage damage from HGA deposition. Urine Analysis for Alkaptonuria: Colour Change: Darkening of urine upon standing is a key indicator. Fehling's or Benedict's Test: Detects reducing substances like HGA; urine from alkaptonuria will turn red/orange with these reagents but does not react with glucose oxidase. Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry (GCMS): Provides definitive identification and quantification of HGA in urine. Treatment: Nitisinone : Inhibits the enzyme that produces homogentisic acid (HGA) and may help slow disease progression. Dietary Restrictions of tyrosine and phenylalanine and vitamin C are not very efficacious but seem reasonable. Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome, Marfan Syndrome, Osteogenesis Imperfecta (Option A,C, & D) do not clinically present with the combination of darkening of urine, ochronosis and large joint arthritis.

On examination, the infant has eczema and a noticeable musty odor. Hair and skin pigmentation appear lighter. Which of the following enzymes is deficient in this infant?",
      "options": {
        "A": "Phenylalanine hydroxylase",
        "B": "Tyrosinase",
        "C": "Tyrosine aminotransferase",
        "D": "4 HPPD (Hydroxy Phenyl pyruvate dioxygenase)"
      },
      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: A) Phenylalanine hydroxylase Explanation: The infant’s symptoms like failure to meet developmental milestones, eczema, a musty odor, and lighter hair and skin pigmentation are characteristic of Phenylketonuria (PKU) . PKU is an autosomal recessive disorder caused by a defect in the enzyme phenylalanine hydroxylase (PAH). This enzyme deficiency disrupts the body's ability to metabolize the amino acid phenylalanine, leading to its accumulation in the body. Clinical features: Severe, irreversible intellectual disability- due to less dopamine and serotonin in the brain (as excess phenylalanine prevents transport of tyrosine and tryptophan to the brain) Microcephaly Epilepsy Behavioral issues Musty odor \"mousy\" smell in sweat and urine, due to phenylacetate Eczema Hypopigmentation of skin and hair Diagnosis of PKU: Plasma Phenylalanine Concentration: Raised phenylalanine levels Raised phenylalanine Other tests: Ferric chloride test, Guthrie test Treatment of PKU: Lifelong Low-Protein Diet Palynziq enzyme supplementation Phenylalanine-Free Formula for infants and children instead of breastmilk. Plasma monitoring: Regular checks of phenylalanine levels to adjust treatment. Sapropterin supplementation based on the tetrahydrobiopterin (BH4) responsiveness, where BH4 is the coenzyme of PAH. Deficiency in tyrosinase (Option B) causes albinism. It does not typically present with a musty odor or developmental delays. Deficiency in tyrosine aminotransferase (Option C) can cause tyrosinemia type 2, which primarily affects the eyes and skin but does not present with a musty odor or developmental delays Deficiency in 4-HPPD (Option D) is less common and typically does not include the musty odor. It causes tyrosinemia type- 3 (Hawkinsuria) with a swimming pool (chlorine) odor. Reference: Ghai Essentials Paediatrics, 10th Edition, Pages 684",

      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: B) Hereditary fructose intolerance Explanation: The infant's symptoms began after the introduction of sugars. (fructose or sucrose). The sweet odor of the diapers suggests the presence of reducing sugars in the urine, such as fructose. Hepatomegaly is consistent with the accumulation of fructose-1-phosphate in the liver, a key feature of hereditary fructose intolerance. Hereditary fructose intolerance: It is a metabolic disorder characterized by the body's inability to properly break down fructose from a deficiency in the enzyme aldolase B. fructose intolerance\" data-author=\"\" data-hash=\"933\" data-license=\"\" data-source=\"\" data-tags=\"March2025\" src=\"https://image.prepladder.com/notes/LOPzowBylvU0LSYBfePQ1742035430.png\" /> The deficiency of aldolase B leads to the accumulation of fructose-1-phosphate in the liver, which leads to liver toxicity, leading to the clinical features of the disorder. Clinical features: Nausea, Vomiting, Poor feeding, Lethargy, and Jaundice occur following the introduction of weaning foods containing fructose into the diet On physical examination: Abdominal pain Hepatomegaly Chronic growth restriction. Initial Evaluation: Test for reducing substances in urine( Positive Benedict and Selewinoff test for ketose sugar) Dipstick test for glucose is usually negative ( Negative glucose oxidase test) Confirmatory Testing: Genetic Testing Measurement of Aldolase Activity: Performed via liver biopsy sample Management: Complete elimination of foods that contain fructose and, sucrose is essential. Advisable to use a multivitamin supplement Phenylketonuria (Option A): Caused by a deficiency in phenylalanine hydroxylase, leading to elevated phenylalanine. Symptoms include developmental delay and a musty odor in urine, not a sweet odor. Typically, symptoms are not triggered specifically by formula feeding. Galactosemia (Option C): Due to a deficiency in galactose-1-phosphate uridyltransferase. Symptoms present very early within days of birth when compared to HFI and include poor feeding, jaundice, and hepatomegaly. Very early presentation within days of birth as compared to Hereditary Fructose Intolerance. Glycogen Storage Disease Type I (Option D): Caused by a deficiency in glucose-6-phosphatase. Symptoms include hypoglycemia, growth retardation, and hepatomegaly. Typically does not present with a sweet odor in the diapers and is not specifically triggered by fructose in formula.
