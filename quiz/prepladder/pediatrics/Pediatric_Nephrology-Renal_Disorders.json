Urinary Tract Infections (UTIs) Etiology and Prevalence: Primary Cause: Colonic bacteria ascending the urinary tract. Common Pathogen: Escherichia coli (54-67% of cases). Other Pathogens: Klebsiella spp., Proteus spp., Enterococcus, Pseudomonas. Clinical Features and Classification: Pyelonephritis (Kidney Infection): Upper renal collecting system involved Symptoms: Abdominal/back/flank pain, fever, malaise, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea. Newborns: Non-specific symptoms like poor feeding, irritability, jaundice, weight loss. Cystitis (Bladder Infection): Only bladder involved Symptoms: Dysuria, urgency, frequency, suprapubic pain, incontinence, malodorous urine. Typically does not cause high fever or renal injury. Risk Factors for Recurrent UTI: Vesicoureteral Reflux (VUR) Bladder-Bowel Dysfunction (BBD) Obstructive Uropathy Urinary Tract Abnormalities: Anatomical issues like labial adhesion. Neuropathic Bladder Catheterisation: Procedures introducing bacteria. Sexual Activity: Increases UTI risk in females. Diagnosis: Urine Culture: Gold standard for UTI diagnosis; identifies and quantifies bacteria. Interpretation: A colony count of >50,000 colony-forming units/mL of a single pathogen, along with pyuria or bacteriuria in a symptomatic child, is generally considered diagnostic of a UTI. Urinalysis: Leukocyte Esterase and Nitrites positive. Imaging Studies: Age < 1 year Age > 1 year USG KUB DMSA scan Micturating cystourethrogram (MCU) USG KUB (abnormal), DMSA scan (abnormal), MCU Treatment: Antibiotic Therapy: Mainstay of UTI treatment. Treatment Specific to UTI Presentations Acute Cystitis Common Antibiotics: TMP-SMX, Nitrofurantoin, Amoxicillin (Option C) Duration: 3-5 days Acute Pyelonephritis Hospitalized: IV Ceftriaxone, Cefepime, Cefotaxime Outpatient: Oral Cefixime, Cephalexin Avoid Nitrofurantoin (Option A) ; use Fluoroquinolones for resistant strains (Option D). Duration: 7-14 days Acute Lobar Nephronia/Abscess Similar to pyelonephritis, but longer duration (14-21 days) Percutaneous or surgical drainage for abscesses",

Correct Answer: C) Deficient abdominal musculature, cryptorchidism and urinary tract abnormalities (Option C) Deficient abdominal musculature Cryptorchidism Urinary tract abnormalities Etiology The exact cause is unknown . Proposed theories: Urethral Obstruction-Malformation Complex: Obstruction during development leads to bladder distension and impacts urinary tract, abdominal wall and testicular development. Yolk Sac Defect: A defect in the yolk sac may contribute to the syndrome. Lateral Plate Mesoderm Defect: Defect in embryological layer forming ureters, bladder, prostate, urethra and gubernaculum. Clinical Presentation Deficient Abdominal Musculature : Wrinkled abdominal appearance. Cryptorchidism : Undescended testicles in most male infants. Urinary Tract Abnormalities : Hydronephrosis, Vesicoureteral reflux, and Recurrent UTIs Treatment Medical Management: Prophylactic Antibiotics : To prevent UTIs, especially in patients with vesicoureteral reflux. Management of Constipation : Important to prevent exacerbation of urinary issues. Surgical Interventions: Orchiopexy : Corrects undescended testicles, typically around 6 months of age. Urinary Tract Reconstruction : For recurrent UTIs or progressive renal issues. Abdominal Wall Reconstruction : For significant abdominal wall deficiencies, often with other surgeries.",

      "explanation": "Correct Answer: B) Increased fluid intake and dietary modification Explanation: The clinical scenario is suggestive of nephrolithiaisis due to hypercalciuria. First-line management for the child includes increased fluid intake to promote urine dilution and dietary modification to prevent stone formation. Nephrolithiasis Etiology Metabolic Causes: Hypercalcemia, hyperphosphatemia, idiopathic hypercalciuria, hyperuricemia, hyperoxaluria, cystinosis. Genetic Disorders: Bartter syndrome, Gitelman syndrome, Dent disease (X-Linked disease). Other Causes: Primary hyperparathyroidism. Pathophysiology Idiopathic Hypercalciuria: increased urinary calcium excretion promotes calcium stone formation. Types of Stones Common Components: Calcium oxalate, calcium phosphate. Clinical Features Neonates/Infants: Weak urinary stream, straining during micturition, distended & palpable bladder. Older Infants/Children: Failure to thrive, recurrent UTIs, sepsis, possible uremia. Common Symptoms: Microscopic or gross hematuria, renal colic (flank/abdomen pain), dysuria, urgency, frequency. Diagnosis USG, VCUG or MCU, DMSA scan. Imaging: Abdominal X-ray (radio-opaque calculi), USG, Spiral CT of abdomen & pelvis. Laboratory Tests: Urine calcium (hypercalciuria), uric acid levels, 24-hour urine collection. Complications Recurrent stone formation UTI Treatment Increased fluid intake, dietary modifications (reduce sodium). Medications: Thiazide diuretics to reduce urinary calcium excretion (in hypercalciuria cases). Surgical Intervention: Required for larger stones (Option A) or if conservative measures fail; procedures used lithotripsy, ureteroscopy, percutaneous nephrolithotomy. Dietary Recommendations: High fluid intake, avoid high-protein diet, dietary calcium usually not restricted (Option D) . Reference: Nelson’s textbook of pediatrics, Edition 21, Page 409,819,2953.

      "explanation": "Correct Answer: D) Only tubular dysfunction is bicarbonaturia Explanation: Fanconi syndrome involves multiple tubular defects , not just bicarbonaturia. There is defective reabsorption of: Glucose → Glycosuria Phosphate → Phosphaturia Amino acids → Aminoaciduria Bicarbonate → Bicarbonaturia Uric acid and other solutes Therefore, stating that only bicarbonaturia is involved is false. Fanconi syndrome is a type of Proximal Renal Tubular Acidosis (RTA) in which there is reduced proximal reabsorption of bicarbonate. Etiology Generalized proximal tubular dysfunction, causing proteinuria, aminoaciduria, bicarbonaturia, phosphaturia, electrolyte wasting and glycosuria Clinical Features Growth retardation (Option C ruled out) Irritability, anorexia (Option B ruled out) and listlessness Rickets (Option A ruled out) Associated Conditions Idiopathic or secondary to: Metabolic disorders (e.g., cystinosis, Lowe syndrome, galactosemia, Wilson disease) Drugs (e.g., ifosfamide, aminoglycosides, cisplatin) Toxins (e.g., cadmium, lead, mercury) Tubulointerstitial nephritis Rickets is seen (Option A) : Phosphate wasting due to proximal tubular dysfunction leads to hypophosphataemia , resulting in rickets in children. Rickets manifests with bone deformities and delayed growth plate mineralisation. Anorexia is a symptom (Option B) : Anorexia and failure to thrive are commonly reported in children with Fanconi syndrome. These result from metabolic acidosis , electrolyte disturbances , and general illness-related fatigue. Growth retardation is seen (Option C) : Chronic loss of bicarbonate, phosphate, glucose, and other nutrients causes growth retardation due to persistent metabolic acidosis and bone disease (rickets or osteomalacia).

      "explanation": "Correct Answer: D) Renal transplantation Explanation: This is the most definitive treatment for primary congenital nephrotic syndrome. It offers the best chance for long-term survival and improved quality of life, even though there is a risk of recurrence post-transplantation. Treatment of Congenital Nephrotic Syndrome (CNS) Primary CNS Manage symptoms and complications. Slow renal insufficiency progression. Supportive Care: Albumin infusions and diuretics for severe edema and fluid overload. (Option A) Nutritional support: High-protein diet (3-4 g/kg), high caloric intake, lipid supplementation Vitamin and thyroid hormone replacement to compensate for urinary losses Infection prophylaxis: Aggressive prevention, including pneumococcal and annual influenza vaccinations for the child and household contacts Pharmacological Management: ACE inhibitors and/or angiotensin II receptor blockers to reduce proteinuria and slow kidney damage progression. (Option B) Prostaglandin synthesis inhibitors (e.g., indomethacin) to decrease proteinuria and glomerular filtration rate, with close renal function monitoring. Surgical Intervention: Unilateral nephrectomy for severe symptoms to reduce proteinuria. Bilateral nephrectomy for persistent severe edema, recurrent infections, or complications from enlarged kidneys; requires chronic dialysis until kidney transplant is available. (Option C) Renal Transplantation: Definitive treatment offering the best chance for long-term survival and quality of life, though recurrence of nephrotic syndrome post-transplantation is possible Secondary CNS Address the underlying cause (e.g., antibiotics for congenital syphilis) If unresolved: Management similar to primary CNS, including supportive care, medications, potential dialysis, and transplantation Specific Genetic Syndromes Denys-Drash Syndrome: Management includes addressing Wilms tumors if present.

      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: B) Finnish type of Congenital Nephrotic Syndrome Explanation: The clinical presentation of severe generalised edema, poor growth, recurrent infections, and hypoalbuminemia in a young infant suggests congenital nephrotic syndrome (CNS). The identification of a mutation in the NPHS1 gene is strongly indicative of the Finnish type of congenital nephrotic syndrome, which is characterised by massive proteinuria, often present at birth. The Finnish type of CNS is caused by mutations in the NPHS1 gene encoding nephrin, a critical protein for glomerular filtration. Clinical Features General Symptoms: Severe generalised edema Poor growth, nutrition and hypoalbuminemia. Increased susceptibility to infections Hypothyroidism due to urinary loss of thyroxine-binding globulin. Increased risk of thrombotic events. Progressive renal insufficiency in most infants. Finnish Type: Edema caused by massive proteinuria, often present at birth. Galloway-Mowat syndrome Marked by the presence of microcephaly, hiatal hernia and congenital nephrotic syndrome. Kidney biopsies in affected patients typically reveal distinctive abnormalities, including deficient or poorly formed basement membranes, or basement membranes infiltrated by fibrils. Investigations Initial Investigations: Urine Analysis: Confirm nephrotic range proteinuria with a spot urine protein. ratio >2.0. Serum Tests: Assess severity with electrolytes, blood urea nitrogen, creatinine, albumin, and cholesterol levels. Evaluation for Secondary Causes: Especially in infants >10 months, including: Complement C3 level Antinuclear antibody Double-stranded DNA Hepatitis B and C testing (high-risk populations) HIV testing (high-risk populations) Additional Investigations: Genetic Testing: Confirm primary CNS. Finnish Type: Mutations in NPHS1 or NPHS2 genes. Denys-Drash Syndrome: Mutations in WT1 gene. (Option A) Pierson Syndrome: Mutations in LAMB2 gene. (Option C) Prenatal Testing: Genetic analysis in families with a history, elevated maternal and amniotic α -fetoprotein levels. Renal Biopsy: Identify specific type of CNS or secondary causes. Other Tests: Liver biopsy, ophthalmologic exams, renal ultrasound. Indications for Biopsy Infants >12 months: Less likely to have minimal change nephrotic syndrome (MCNS). Atypical Presentation: Gross hematuria, hypertension, renal insufficiency, or hypocomplementemia. Suspicion of Secondary CNS: Systemic diseases or infections suspected. Steroid-resistant Nephrotic Syndrome: Confirm diagnosis and differentiate between causes like focal segmental glomerulosclerosis",

      "explanation": "Correct Answer: B) NPHS 1 Explanation: NPHS1 mutation causes Finnish Type Congenital Nephrotic Syndrome (CNS), which is the most common form of CNS. Characterised by severe proteinuria in utero and elevated AFP levels, with symptoms manifesting soon after birth. Congenital nephrotic syndrome Congenital nephrotic syndrome is a group of disorders characterized by nephrotic syndrome onset within the first three months of life. Key Features: Anasarca, hypoalbuminemia, oliguria. Genetic Defects and Associated Syndromes 1. Finnish Type CNS Inheritance: Autosomal recessive. Gene Defect: NPHS1 gene mutation (nephrin protein). Clinical Features: Severe in utero proteinuria, maternal complications like polyhydramnios, symptoms of nephrotic syndrome soon after birth. Diagnosis: Prenatal detection of elevated alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) levels in maternal serum and amniotic fluid. 2. Denys-Drash Syndrome Gene Defect: WT1 gene mutation (tumour suppressor gene on chromosome 11). (Option A ruled out) Clinical Features: Congenital nephrotic syndrome, male pseudohermaphroditism, increased risk of Wilms' tumour. Diagnosis: Genetic testing for WT1 mutations; renal biopsy may show diffuse mesangial sclerosis. 3. Other Genetic Causes Genes Involved: Mutations in PLCE1, NPHS2. (Option C & D ruled out) Role: Affect podocyte function and glomerular development. Diagnosis and Genetic Testing Indications for Testing : CNS onset before 3 months of age, initial steroid resistance in infancy, familial steroid resistance. Testing Methods: Next-generation sequencing, targeted gene panels, whole-exome sequencing. Management and Prognosis Management: Control edema with medications and fluid management. Manage proteinuria with ACE inhibitors. Ensure adequate nutrition. Prompt infection treatment. Address specific complications. Prognosis: Varies by genetic defect; Finnish-type CNS may lead to renal failure by 2-3 years. Reference: OP Ghai essentials of Pediatrics Edition 10, Page 505, 506",

      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer : B) ACE inhibitors or angiotensin II receptor blockers Explanation ACE inhibitors or angiotensin II receptor blockers are recommended to control blood pressure and reduce proteinuria in managing IgA nephropathy. IgA Nephropathy (Berger Disease) Overview Most common chronic glomerular disease in children; immune complex disease causing glomerular inflammation and damage. Can present as a severe form of RPGN in certain cases, though not typically classified as RPGN Causes Immune Response: Triggered by environmental factors like infections. Genetic Factors: Higher prevalence in certain ethnic groups. Pathology & Diagnosis IgA deposition in the mesangium. Diagnosis: Renal biopsy confirms and assesses histologic severity. Symptoms Hematuria: Blood in urine, often following respiratory or gastrointestinal infections. Other Symptoms: Loin pain, proteinuria, hypertension, edema. Treatment Blood Pressure Control: ACE inhibitors or angiotensin II receptor blockers. Additional Therapy: Fish oil (anti-inflammatory), corticosteroids for severe cases. Prognosis Children: Generally favorable with minimal long-term kidney damage. Adults: 20-30% may develop progressive disease, potentially leading to kidney failure. Daily use of diuretics (Option A) : Not the first line of treatment for IgA nephropathy; primarily used in cases with significant fluid retention or hypertension. Antibiotics to prevent infections (Option C) : While infections can trigger episodes, antibiotics are not a primary treatment for IgA nephropathy. High-dose corticosteroids (Option D) : Considered for severe cases with significant proteinuria or rapid progression but not as an initial treatment.

        "D": "Membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis"
      },
      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: A) Type I RPGN (Anti-GBM Antibody Disease) Explanation Type I RPGN (Anti-GBM Antibody Disease); characterized by the presence of anti-GBM antibodies, which cause linear IgG deposits along the glomerular basement membrane, and is associated with Goodpasture syndrome (hemoptysis and glomerulonephritis). RPGN (Crescentic glomerulonephritis) is characterized by the formation of crescents in Bowman's space due to the proliferation of parietal epithelial cells. Classified into primary and secondary types based on the underlying cause: Primary RPGN Cause is unknown or not linked to systemic disease. Diagnosed primarily through kidney biopsy and exclusion of systemic causes. Secondary RPGN Triggered by systemic diseases that also affect the kidneys. Often associated with systemic autoimmune diseases or infections (Systemic lupus erythematosus, Henoch-Schönlein purpura, membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis, postinfectious GN). Detected by clinical presentation and serological tests. Types of Rapidly Progressive Glomerulonephritis (RPGN) RPGN Type Cause Associated Conditions Characteristics Type I RPGN Autoimmune attack on the glomerular basement membrane (GBM). Goodpasture syndrome (lung hemorrhage + RPGN). Presence of anti-GBM antibodies in blood, severe kidney damage, and lung involvement in Goodpasture syndrome. Type II RPGN Immune complex deposition in the glomeruli. Lupus nephritis IgA nephropathy postinfectious GN. Immune complexes trigger inflammation; can be a severe form of immune-related diseases. Type III RPGN Characterized by few or no immune complexes in the glomeruli, associated with ANCA. Granulomatosis with polyangiitis, microscopic polyangiitis. Known as pauci-immune; detected by the presence of ANCA in blood, with no significant immune complex deposits on kidney biopsy. Type II RPGN (Immune Complex Mediated) (Option B): Involves immune complex deposition but not linear IgG deposits. Type III RPGN (Pauci-Immune)(Option C): Characterized by the absence of significant immune complex deposits and presence of ANCAs, not linear IgG deposits. Membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis(Option D): Usually presents with immune complex deposition, not linear IgG deposits. Reference: Nelson Textbook of Paediatrics, Edition 21, Page 2727,2728",
