      "correct_answer": "D",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: D) Bruton's Disease Explanation: Brutons’s Disease Also known as X-linked agammaglobulinemia (XLA), caused by mutations in the BTK (Bruton’s tyrosine kinase) gene present on the q22 long arm of the X chromosome. Defective B-cell maturation leads to an absence of mature B cells and very low levels of all immunoglobulins (IgG, IgA, IgM). Clinical features : Presents after 6-9 months of age. Recurrent bacterial infections (eg, encapsulated bacteria like Streptococcus pneumonia, Haemophilus influenzae) starting around 6 months of age, including otitis media, pneumonia, and sinusitis, Neutropenia and enterovirus infections. Diagnosis : Absence of B cells (CD19+ cells) in peripheral blood and Markedly low immunoglobulin levels No germinal centres in lymph nodes Severe Combined Immunodeficiency (SCID) (Option A): Affects both T-cells and B-cells and causes severe infections early in life but not limited to B-cell deficiency as in Bruton's disease. DiGeorge Syndrome (Option B): Involves T-cell deficiency due to thymic hypoplasia and presents with congenital heart defects and facial anomalies, but B-cell numbers are typically normal. Common Variable Immunodeficiency (CVID) (Option C): Usually presents later in life (adolescence or adulthood) with B cells present but dysfunctional and does not involve an absence of B cells like in Bruton's disease.

        "D": "Hyper IgM Syndrome"
      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: B) Common Variable Immunodeficiency (CVID) Explanation: Common Variable Immunodeficiency (CVID) CVID is a primary immunodeficiency disorder characterized by hypogammaglobulinemia where IgG must be <2 standard deviation below the age-adjusted norms with low IgA or IgM levels. Genes known to produce CVID phenotype when mutated include ICOS deficiency, SH2DIA, CD19, CD20, CD21, BAFF- R, TACI. Both B and T cells are affected. Can present at any age, but most commonly diagnosed in late childhood or early adulthood (age 20-40). Clinical Features : Sinopulmonary infections (e.g., pneumonia, bronchitis, sinusitis, otitis media) are particularly common due to impaired antibody response. Chronic diarrhea, malabsorption, and weight loss are common, Increased risk for autoimmune diseases. Higher risk of developing lymphoma and Non-infectious granulomas can occur in various organs, including the lungs, liver, and spleen. Diagnosis : Markedly low levels of IgG and IgA, and sometimes IgM. Severe Combined Immunodeficiency (SCID) (Option A): Severe immunodeficiency that typically presents in infancy with life-threatening infections due to profound T-cell dysfunction, not in adulthood with isolated respiratory symptoms. IgA Deficiency (Option C): Typically presents with isolated low IgA levels, while IgG and IgM remain normal, unlike CVID, which involves multiple immunoglobulin deficiencies. Hyper IgM Syndrome (Option D): It presents in early childhood with recurrent infections and is characterized by elevated or normal IgM with low IgG and IgA.

      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: B) CD40L Explanation: The above features are suggestive of Hyper IgM syndrome due to mutation in CD40 Ligand gene. X-Linked Hyper IgM Syndrome Autosomal Recessive Hyper IgM Syndrome Mutation in the CD40 ligand on T cells (CD40L) gene Mutations in Activation Induced Cytidine Deaminase(AICDA) and CD40 gene X-linked recessive; predominantly affects males. Autosomal recessive; affects both males and females equally Deficiency in CD40L impairs B cell and T cell communication, affecting immunoglobulin class switching. Defects in class switch recombination due to mutations in AICDA and CD40 gene. Recurrent bacterial infections, opportunistic infections, autoimmune disorders and increased cancer risk. Decreased antigen-specific T-cell function. Marked susceptibility to P. jiroveci pneumonia. Decreased frequency of CD27+ memory B cells. Recurrent infections, Polyarthritis, Autoimmune hepatitis, Crohn’s disease and hemolytic anemia. Do not have susceptibility to P. jiroveci pneumonia. Presence of lymphoid hyperplasia. Elevated IgM, low IgG, IgA, and IgE; genetic testing for CD40L mutations. Elevated IgM, low IgG, IgA, and IgE; genetic testing for mutations in CD40, AICDA. Immunoglobulin (IVIG) replacement therapy, prophylactic antibiotics. Immunoglobulin (IVIG) replacement therapy, prophylactic antibiotics. RAG1 (Option A): Mutations in the RAG1 gene are associated with Severe Combined Immunodeficiency (SCID) and are crucial for the development of functional B and T lymphocytes. IL-12R β 1 (Option C): Mutations in the IL-12 receptor β 1 chain are associated with Mendelian Susceptibility to Mycobacterial Disease (MSMD) is involved in the immune response (granuloma formation) to intracellular pathogens like mycobacteria. ADA (Option D): Adenosine deaminase (ADA) deficiency is a cause of SCID, as the enzyme is essential for the purine salvage pathway and lymphocyte survival.

      "question": "A child presents with recurrent respiratory infections, but his total IgG level is normal. Testing reveals a low IgG2 subclass level. What is the most appropriate management strategy?",
      "options": {
        "A": "Immediate initiation of intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) therapy",
        "B": "Administration of live vaccines",
        "C": "Prophylactic antibiotics and tailored vaccination schedule",
        "D": "Initiation of corticosteroid therapy"
      },
      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: C) Prophylactic antibiotics and tailored vaccination schedule Explanation: Prophylactic antibiotics and tailored vaccination schedule is appropriate for managing IgG subclass deficiency to prevent infections and monitor vaccine responses. IgG Subclass Deficiency Definition Low levels of one or more IgG subclasses (IgG1, IgG2, IgG3, IgG4) despite normal or elevated total IgG levels. Symptoms Clinical impact varies; some have recurrent infections, others are asymptomatic. Testing Normal IgG levels do not ensure protection against all infections; specific antibody production is crucial. IgG subclass measurement helps diagnose isolated subclass deficiencies, specific antibody deficiencies, and CVID. Testing Methods: Radial immunodiffusion (RID), ELISA, nephelometry, and turbidimetry. Diagnosis Criteria Requires one or more IgG subclass levels below the 5th percentile with normal IgG, IgA, and IgM levels. Treatment Immunoglobulin Replacement Therapy: For broader antibody deficiency or recurrent infections. Antibiotic Prophylaxis: Used in children to prevent infections. Vaccination: Tailored schedules with monitored responses. Monitoring Regular follow-up to adjust management and monitor for complications like bronchiectasis. Immediate initiation of intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) therapy (Option A): IVIG is typically reserved for those with broader antibody deficiencies or severe infections, not for isolated IgG subclass deficiency without evidence of a broader deficiency. Administration of live vaccines (Option B): Live vaccines can be risky in individuals with certain immune deficiencies. Initiation of corticosteroid therapy (Option D): Corticosteroids are not typically used for managing IgG subclass deficiency.

      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: C) Wiskott-Aldrich Syndrome Explanation: The triad of eczema, thrombocytopenia with small platelets, and immunodeficiency is characteristic of Wiskott-Aldrich Syndrome. Wiskott-Aldrich Syndrome Definition Rare X-linked recessive disorder affecting males; characterized by eczema, thrombocytopenia, and immunodeficiency. Genetic Basis Caused by mutations in the WASP gene, affecting actin cytoskeleton in blood cells. Clinical Features Eczema : Develops within the first year; ranges from mild to severe. Thrombocytopenia: Present at birth; leads to prolonged bleeding from the umbilical stump , easy bruising, petechiae , and purpura. Immunodeficiency: Susceptible to infections (bacterial, viral, opportunistic); increased risk of autoimmune disorders and malignancies (lymphomas, leukemia). Diagnosis Clinical Triad: Eczema, thrombocytopenia, and immunodeficiency. Lab Tests: CBC (small, abnormally shaped platelets), immunoglobulin levels ( low IgM, high IgA and IgE), lymphocyte subset analysis (low T cells), genetic testing (WASP mutations). Mnemonic: WATER - WA SP gene mutation, T hrombocytopenia, E czema, R ecurrent infections Treatment Supportive Care: Preventative antibiotics, immunoglobulin replacement, eczema management, use of killed vaccines. Curative Treatment: Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) Prognosis Without HSCT: Often fatal in childhood due to infections, bleeding, or malignancies. With HSCT: Can significantly improve life expectancy; risks include graft-versus-host disease (GvHD). Severe Combined Immunodeficiency (SCID) (Option A) presents with severe immunodeficiency but typically lacks thrombocytopenia or small platelets. Henoch-Schonlein purpura (Option B) is characterised by palpable purpura, joint Involvement, abdominal pain, and renal involvement, but does not usually present with eczema or thrombocytopenia. Ataxia-Telangiectasia (Option D) involves cerebellar ataxia, telangiectasia and immunodeficiency but does not present with thrombocytopenia or eczema.

      "explanation": "Correct Answer: B) Ataxia-Telangiectasia Explanation: Ataxia-Telangiectasia is characterized by cerebellar ataxia, telangiectasias, and immunodeficiency. Ataxia-Telangiectasia Definition: Rare, multisystem disorder from ATM gene mutations, causing neurological, immune, endocrine, hepatic, and skin abnormalities. Genetic Basis: Autosomal recessive inheritance of ATM gene mutations, affecting DNA repair and cell cycle regulation. Clinical Features Neurological: Progressive cerebellar ataxia (poor coordination, unsteady gait) Oculocutaneous telangiectasias (dilated blood vessels on sclera and ears). Immunodeficiency: Variable with low immunoglobulins and T cells; common IgA deficiency (selective absence of IgA in 50-80 %); impaired T- and B-cell responses; small, disorganized thymus. Other Features: Chronic respiratory infections, increased risk of cancers (lymphomas, leukemia), endocrine issues (diabetes), liver dysfunction and growth retardation. Diagnosis Clinical signs, family history, and lab tests including genetic testing for ATM mutations, immunoglobulin levels, lymphocyte counts, raised AFP Chromosomal analysis and radiation sensitivity. Treatment Supportive care: physical, occupational, and speech therapy; immunoglobulin replacement; prophylactic antibiotics; cancer screening; genetic counseling. No cure. Friedreich's Ataxia (Option A) typically does not present with telangiectasias or immunodeficiency.

      "options": {
        "A": "Start intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) therapy",
        "B": "Perform genetic testing for IL2RG mutation",
        "C": "Initiate broad-spectrum antibiotics",
        "D": "Schedule bone marrow biopsy"
      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer : B) Perform genetic testing for IL2RG mutation Explanation: Genetic testing for IL2RG mutation is crucial as X-linked SCID is the most common form, and confirming the diagnosis guides treatment. Severe combined immunodeficiency Rare, life-threatening genetic disorder affecting the immune system, marked by dysfunctional or absent T cells, B cells, and/or NK cells. SCID is primary immunodeficiency; a type of combined immunodeficiency with ,syndromic features. Infections: High susceptibility to bacterial, viral, fungal, and opportunistic infections. Onset: Symptoms typically appear within the first few weeks or months of life. SCID is a true pediatric immunologic emergency. Common Symptoms Failure to thrive, chronic diarrhea, skin rashes, underdeveloped tonsils, and lymph nodes. Types and Causes X-linked SCID: IL2R I gene mutation affecting γ c protein. Autosomal Recessive SCID: Common RAG1 / RAG2 Mutations: Affect V(D)J recombination. ADA Deficiency: Causes toxic metabolite (adenosine) buildup harming lymphocytes; associated with bone/cartilage abnormalities, mesangial sclerosis, adrenal gland sclerosis, cognitive issues, and hearing loss. Diagnosis Based on clinical presentation, family history and laboratory tests (e.g., newborn screening, CBC, lymphocyte subset analysis, genetic testing). Diagnostic indicator: Profound lymphopenia (very low lymphocyte count). Treatment HSCT: Preferred treatment, especially effective if performed early. Alternatives include gene therapy and enzyme replacement therapy- polyethylene glycol–modified bovine ADA (PEG-ADA), though PEG-ADA is lifelong. Supportive Care: Prophylactic antibiotics, immunoglobulin replacement, avoidance of live vaccines, and nutritional support. Prognosis Without Treatment: Usually fatal within the first two years of life. With Treatment: Early diagnosis and treatment with HSCT before infection improves the survival rate by 95%. Start intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) therapy (Option A): IVIG therapy is supportive but not diagnostic; further testing is needed to confirm SCID. Initiate broad-spectrum antibiotics (Option C): Broad-spectrum antibiotics may be necessary but do not address the underlying immune deficiency. Schedule bone marrow biopsy (Option D): A bone marrow biopsy is not the first diagnostic step; genetic testing is more specific for SCID.

Henoch-Schönlein Purpura (HSP) Etiology Exact cause unknown. Immune-mediated vasculitis, often following an upper respiratory infection. Genetic predisposition, with HLA-B34 and DRB1 observed in some cases. Most common in Males (Option A) . Pathology and Pathophysiology Inflammation of small blood vessels affecting skin, joints, intestines, and kidneys. Triggered by immune system response to infections. Leakage of fluid and blood cells into tissues. Immune complex deposition, particularly IgA , in affected vessels. Clinical Features Palpable Purpura: Raised, purplish-red rash, mainly on lower limbs (Option C) and buttocks. (Option B) Joint Involvement: Joint swelling, commonly in knees and ankles. Abdominal Pain: Often severe, may include vomiting, diarrhea, gastrointestinal bleeding, or intussusception Renal Involvement: Less common, presents as Chronic renal failure. Diagnosis Clinical Criteria: Palpable purpura plus at least one of: Diffuse abdominal pain Arthritis or arthralgia Biopsy-proven IgA deposition Renal involvement Laboratory involvement: Elevated ESR or CRP indicating inflammation. Platelet Counts are normal. Complications Intussusception. Chronic Renal Failure due to Long-term kidney damage, in severe cases.",

      "explanation": "Correct answer C) Start high-dose intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) and high-dose aspirin. high-dose IVIG along with high-dose aspirin. Kawasaki Disease (KD) Etiology and Pathophysiology Higher incidence in children of Asian descent.. Vasculitis affecting medium-sized arteries, especially coronary arteries. Pathology Acute Phase (Days 1-10): Neutrophilic inflammation of blood vessels. Infiltration of inflammatory cells, vessel wall swelling and damage. Subacute Phase (Weeks 2-4): Risk of fusiform aneurysm formation as inflammation subsides. Convalescent Phase (Weeks >4 weeks): Resolution of inflammation; potential scarring and thickening of arterial walls leading to stenosis. Clinical Features Fever: For at least 5 days. Extremities: Swelling, redness, peeling skin around nails, fingers, and toes. Mucocutaneous : Bilateral conjunctivitis, red and cracked lips, \"strawberry tongue,\" and pharyngeal congestion. Polymorphous Rash: Various forms (macular, papular, target-like lesions). Cervical Lymphadenopathy: Unilateral, painful swelling of neck lymph nodes. Diagnosis Clinical Criteria: Fever lasting at least 5 days. At least 4 of the following: 5-“ CREAM ” features C - Conjunctivitis, B/Lnon-purulent R - Rash involving trunk E- Erythema & Edema of palms & soles along with desquamation A - Adenopathy (usually unilateral, cervical) M- Mucositis (Strawberry Tongue) Laboratory Findings: Elevated CRP and ESR. Elevated WBC count. Echocardiography coronary artery aneurysms. Complications Myocardial infarction. Coronary Artery Aneurysms. Coronary Artery Stenosis: Differential Diagnosis Bacterial Infections (e.g., Scarlet Fever, Staphylococcal Scalded Skin Syndrome): Fever, rash, mucosal involvement with additional features like sore throat or blistering. Treatment Intravenous Immunoglobulin (IVIG): Reduces inflammation and lowers risk of aneurysms. Aspirin: High doses initially to reduce inflammation and fever; then low-dose regimen for anti-platelet effects. IVIG-Resistant KD: Second dose of IVIG, corticosteroids, or other immunosuppressive medications (e.g., infliximab, cyclosporine). Initiate Ceftriaxone for a suspected bacterial infection (Option A): Kawasaki Disease is not caused by a bacterial infection, and antibiotics are not effective in treating KD. Perform an echocardiogram to assess for coronary artery involvement (Option B): Although echocardiogram is crucial in KD for detecting coronary artery aneurysms and monitoring heart",

      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: B) Muscle Biopsy Explanation: The clinical scenario with Heliotrope rash, Gottrons papule and mechanic hands are indicative of Juvenile Dermatomyositis. A muscle biopsy is crucial for diagnosing juvenile dermatomyositis (JDM) Juvenile Dermatomyositis Etiology Genetic Predisposition: HLA-DQA10501 and DRB10301. Pathophysiology Autoimmune disorder attacking muscle and skin, leading to muscle inflammation (myositis) and skin involvement (dermatomyositis). T lymphocytes involved. Muscle Fiber Damage: Degeneration and necrosis of muscle fibers. Clinical Features Muscle Weakness: Progressive weakness, especially in proximal muscles-Gower’s sign positive. Skin Rashes: Heliotrope rash [A] (eyelids), Gottron papules [B] (knuckles, elbows, knees), Mechanic hands[C] and Shawl sign. Fatigue, muscle pain, dysphagia, joint pain, weight loss. Diagnosis Heliotrope rash and Gottron's papules + any of 3 of the following Laboratory Investigations: Muscle Enzymes: Elevated CK, aldolase, AST, ALT, LDH. EMG and Nerve Conduction Studies: Differentiates muscle disease from neuropathy. Muscle Biopsy: Confirms diagnosis. Complications Calcinosis: Calcium deposits causing pain and skin ulcerations. Contractures. Gastrointestinal Issues: Dysphagia, abdominal pain, GI bleeding. Interstitial lung disease. Treatment Corticosteroids: Main treatment, reduces inflammation. Methotrexate, Azathioprine, mycophenolate mofetil, IVIG for severe cases. Sun Protection: Sensitivity to sunlight. Skin Biopsy (Option A) is not done in JDM. Antinuclear Antibody (ANA) Test (Option C): ANA test can be positive in JDM but is not specific. Electromyography (EMG) (Option D): EMG can help assess muscle function and detect abnormalities consistent with myopathy but does not provide a definitive diagnosis.",
