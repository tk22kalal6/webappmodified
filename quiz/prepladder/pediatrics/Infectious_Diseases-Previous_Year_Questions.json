      "question": "An unvaccinated 5-year-old child of a migrant worker family was brought to the causality with fever and a characteristic skin rash. Upon eye examination, Bitot’s spot was seen. What is the appropriate management?",
      "options": {
        "A": "Isolate and give nutritional supply with vitamin A supplement",
        "B": "Give measles vaccine and vitamin A supplement",
        "C": "Institutional Isolation, nutritional management with vitamin A supplement",
        "D": "Only measles vaccine"
      },
      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: A) Isolate and give nutritional supply with vitamin A supplement Explanation: The child has a fever and rash with cough and coryza with a non-immunised status which points to the diagnosis of measles. However, the presence of Bitot’s spot also shows vitamin A deficiency. Hence, the management here is isolation of the child, and nutritional management with vitamin A supplementation. Aspects Description Causative agent Measles (rubeola) is a highly communicable childhood exanthematous illness caused by the measles virus, an RNA virus from the Paramyxoviridae family. Transmission Contact with droplet aerosols (through the respiratory tract or conjunctiva) Pathogenesis Primary viremia occurs, resulting in infection of the reticuloendothelial system, followed by secondary viremia, which results in systemic symptoms. Incubation period 8-12 days Period of infectivity From 3 days before to 4 days after the rash onset. Clinical manifestations Common in preschool children Prodromal phase: Fever (before rash), rhinorrhea, conjunctival congestion and a dry hacking cough . Koplik spots , pathognomonic for measles, appear on the 2nd or 3rd day of illness as grey-white, sand-like lesions with surrounding erythema on the buccal mucosa opposite the lower second molars. Rash The erythematous maculopapular rash in measles appears on the 4th day, starting behind the ears, along the hairline, and posterior cheeks, then spreading to the rest of the body over the next 2-3 days. Management Isolation . Symptomatic and conservative (antipyretics, maintenance of hygiene, ensuring adequate fluid and caloric intake , and humidification). Treatment of vitamin A deficiency : Age Group Treatment Under 6 months 50,000 IU once daily on D1, D2, and 4 weeks later 6 to 12 months 100,000 IU once daily on D1, D2, and 4 weeks later Over 1 year 200,000 IU once daily on D1, D2, and 4 weeks later Giving a measles vaccine and vitamin A supplement (Option B) or only a measles vaccine (Option D) is not appropriate since the child is already suffering from measles. Institutional Isolation, nutritional management and vitamin A supplement (Option C) : Institutional isolation is unnecessary in this case since the child does not have any general danger signs, respiratory distress or pneumonia.",

      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: A) Measles Explanation: Subacute Sclerosing Panencephalitis is a rare fatal, severe, long-standing complication of measles . It is a progressive neurological disorder that affects the central nervous system. It typically develops 7-13 years after primary measles infection. Complications of Measles: Otitis media (m/c complication), Pneumonia (m/c cause of death), other respiratory complications - bronchitis, laryngitis, etc. Subacute Sclerosing Panencephalitis (SSPE) : Rare, fatal and long term complication. Acute encephalitis Prevention Measles is a preventable and potentially eradicable disease. Maternal antibodies protect infants until 6-9 months of age, so administering the vaccine at 9 months in endemic countries ensures early protection and seroconversion. The measles vaccine, derived from the Edmonston-Zagreb strain , is available as a monovalent preparation or in combination with rubella (MR), mumps (MMR), and varicella (MMR-V). The vaccine schedule is as follows: Vaccine MR (Measles-Rubella) Type Live attenuated Dose 0.5 ml Site Anterolateral thigh or right upper arm (at the insertion of deltoid) Schedule 1st dose - 9 months; 2nd dose - 16-24 months Reference: Nelson Textbook of Pediatrics, 21st edition, Pages 1673, 1674 Ghai Essential Pediatrics, 10th edition, Pages 231, 232, 197, 198",

      "explanation": "Correct Answer B- Coxsackie virus Explanation: The characteristic presentation of fever accompanied by painful oral sores and hand rash is the classic triad of Hand Foot Mouth Disease . Coxsackie virus , particularly type A16 , is the causative agent of this condition. Hand Foot Mouth Disease (HFMD) Causative organism Coxsackie A16 virus, Enterovirus 71 Age group <5 years Clinical features Low grade fever, feeling of being unwell, sore throat are commonly observed.

      "question": "What would be the most appropriate course of action for the care of child Ajay, the 3-year-old brother of Anuj, who resides in the same household and received diphtheria vaccination approximately 16 months ago, while Anuj is currently undergoing treatment for diphtheria in the ward?",
      "options": {
        "A": "One booster dose",
        "B": "Nothing, as the child is already exposed",
        "C": "Erythromycin + diphtheria toxoid",
        "D": "Erythromycin only"
      },
      "correct_answer": "D",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: D) Erythromycin only Explanation: In situations where there is a known case of diphtheria in the household, it is recommended to administer erythromycin to individuals who have been in close contact with the infected person. Since Ajay, the younger sibling, has not developed symptoms but has been exposed , administering erythromycin alone is appropriate to prevent the development of the infection. Diphtheria - Management of contacts Asymptomatic Case Contacts Includes household members and close contacts. Monitored for 7 days for symptoms. Prophylaxis: IM benzathine penicillin G (600,000 units for <6 years, 1,200,000 units for ≥ 6 years) or 10-day oral erythromycin (40- 50 mg/kg/day, max 2 g/day). Assess and update immunization status. Booster Dose : Administer the diphtheria toxoid vaccine to individuals who have not received a booster within the past 5 years. Vaccinate children who have not yet received their 4th dose of diphtheria toxoid. Incomplete or Uncertain Immunization : For those who have received fewer than 3 doses of diphtheria toxoid or have an uncertain immunization status, provide the vaccine according to the primary immunization schedule with an age-appropriate preparation Asymptomatic Carriers Receive 10-14 days of antimicrobial prophylaxis (oral erythromycin). Administer diphtheria toxoid vaccine if no booster has been given in the past year. Droplet precautions for respiratory carriers; contact precautions for cutaneous carriers. Precautions continue until two negative cultures (24 hours apart) post-treatment. Antitoxin is not recommended for asymptomatic carriers. Follow-up & Repeat Cultures Repeat cultures for cases and carriers 2 weeks post treatment. If positive, repeat a 10 day erythromycin course and further cultures. Complete eradication is not guaranteed after one course of antibiotics. Casual Contacts Routine investigation is not recommended due to low carriage rates. Hospital-Acquired Transmission Rare; only those with direct contact with respiratory/oral secretions need management as contacts. While one booster dose (Option A) of the diphtheria vaccine is generally recommended as part of routine immunization schedules, it is not the next best step in this case. As the child is 3 years old, he would have received the 4th dose (1st booster dose) of diphtheria vaccine between 16- 24 months of age. Since he has received a booster dose in the last 5 years, only Erythromycin is needed in this patient. Nothing as the child is already exposed (Option B): Even though the younger sibling has received vaccination against diphtheria 16 months ago, it does not ensure complete protection or eliminate the risk of infection. Vaccination provides immunity, but it may not be 100% effective in preventing infection. Therefore, appropriate measures should be taken to minimize the risk of transmission and potential illness. Administering both erythromycin and diphtheria toxoid (Option C) is not the recommended next step in this case. In the case of the younger sibling who has not developed symptoms, administration of erythromycin alone is sufficient as a preventive measure.",

      "question": "Which maternal antibodies do not confer substantial immunity in a newborn?",
      "options": {
        "A": "Tetanus",
        "B": "Polio",
        "C": "Diphtheria",
        "D": "Measles"
      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: B) Polio Explanation: In polio, maternal antibodies do not provide significant immunity to the neonate. This is because the transfer of polio-specific antibodies from the mother to the fetus is limited and the protection offered by these antibodies against polio infection is not as robust. Poliovirus (Family: Picornaviridae) Transmission: Fecal-oral route Incubation Period: 8-12 days from exposure to the onset of symptoms. It has three serotypes: PV1, PV2, and PV3 Pathogenesis: The virus spreads from the intestinal tract to the central nervous system (CNS), potentially causing aseptic meningitis and poliomyelitis. Poliomyelitis often leads to flaccid paralysis because it primarily affects the anterior horn cells in the spinal cord , which are responsible for motor control resulting in muscle weakness and atrophy. Reflexes may be diminished or absent due to the disruption of the motor neurons. Types of Poliovirus Infections: Inapparent Infection 90-95% of cases; asymptomatic Abortive Poliomyelitis Mild, flu-like symptoms with full recovery Nonparalytic Poliomyelitis More severe symptoms, including neck stiffness and pain, with a good prognosis Paralytic Poliomyelitis Includes spinal, bulbar, and polio encephalitis forms, presenting with various degrees of paralysis Diagnosis: Consider polio in any unimmunised child with acute flaccid paralysis , particularly in areas with past or current polio cases. Isolation of poliovirus from stool specimens collected 24-48 hours apart. Management: Supportive care is primary; ventilatory support may be necessary for severe respiratory involvement. Prevention (Vaccination): Oral Polio Vaccine (OPV): Live attenuated vaccine administered orally that induces both systemic & mucosal immunity with a risk of vaccine-associated polio. Inactivated Polio Vaccine (IPV): Killed virus vaccine. Given via injection that provides systemic immunity without the risk of vaccine-derived polio. Maternal antibodies formed from Tdap vaccination during pregnancy will provide immunity against tetanus (Option A), diphtheria (Option C), and pertussis in the newborn. Administering the Tdap vaccine earlier, between the 27th and 36th week of gestation, maximizes the transfer of passive antibodies to the infant. Maternal antibodies generally protect infants less than 6 months from measles (Option D). Reference: Nelson textbook of pediatrics, 21st edition, Page 1353, 1377, 1684,1685,1688",

      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: B) Antibiotic prophylaxis Explanation: Meningococcal meningitis is a bacterial infection that can spread through close contact with respiratory and throat secretions of an infected person. It is important to take precautions to prevent the spread of the disease among other students by taking antibiotic prophylaxis . Antibiotics can be given to individuals who have been in close contact with someone diagnosed with meningococcal meningitis to help prevent the spread of the bacteria . Chemoprophylaxis following meningococcal exposure: Close contacts warranting chemoprophylaxis: Household contacts (including persons who ate or slept in the same dwelling as the patient during the 7 days prior to disease onset) Child-care and nursery-school contacts Persons having contact with patient’s oral secretions during the 7 days prior to disease onset: Sharing of toothbrushes Sharing of eating utensils Mouth-to-mouth resuscitation Kissing Unprotected contact during endotracheal intubation Aircraft contacts for persons seated next to the patient for > 8 hrs Prophylaxis is provided to contacts within 24 hours of identification of the index case.

        "C": "IgM measles in CSF",
        "D": "C1Q4 antibodies in the CSF"
      },
      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer A - lgG measles in CSF: The child's history of fever with rash at 1 year of age, which resolved spontaneously, suggests a possible previous measles infection. Subacute sclerosing panencephalitis (SSPE) is a rare complication of measles that can occur years after a measles infection. In SSPE, there is persistent measles virus infection in the central nervous system, leading to inflammation and progressive neurological deterioration. To diagnose SSPE, the presence of elevated measles-specific IgG antibodies in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) is considered a helpful investigation. IgG antibodies are produced in response to previous infection and can persist in the CSF for an extended period. Complications of Measles: Complications of measles are more frequent in the young, malnourished and immunocompromised individuals. Otitis media (most common complication) Pneumonia (most common cause of death) Other respiratory complications - bronchitis, laryngitis, etc. Subacute Sclerosing Panencephalitis (SSPE): rare, fatal (most common long term complication. Acute encephalitis Prevention of Measles: Measles is a preventable and potentially eradicable disease. Maternal antibodies protect infants until 6-9 months of age, so administering the vaccine at 9 months in endemic countries ensures early protection and seroconversion. The measles vaccine, derived from the Edmonston-Zagreb strain , is available as a monovalent preparation or in combination with rubella (MR), mumps (MMR), and varicella (MMR-V). The vaccination schedule is as follows: Vaccine MR (Measles-Rubella) Type Live attenuated Dose 0.5 ml Site Right upper arm (at the insertion of deltoid) Schedule 1st dose - 9 months; 2nd dose - 16-24 months MRI mesial temporal lobe sclerosis (Option B) is a specific finding on MRI associated with temporal lobe epilepsy. It is characterized by atrophy and abnormal signal intensity in the mesial temporal structures, particularly the hippocampus. The detection of lgM measles in CSF (Option C) may indicate recent or ongoing measles infection. However, in the case of SSPE, the initial measles infection usually occurred several years before the onset of symptoms. Therefore, the presence of IgM antibodies in CSF is not helpful in diagnosing SSPE. C1Q4 antibodies in the CSF (Option D) are not associated with SSPE or measles infection. These antibodies are typically associated with certain autoimmune diseases, such as systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE).

Dexamethasone started 1-2 hr before antibiotics and continued for 48 hrs - Prevents cytokine-mediated CNS injury. Febrile seizures (Option A) typically occur in response to fever, but in the absence of other features of central nervous system infection like bulging fontanelle, poor feeding, and lethargy, they are less likely to be the cause. These symptoms suggest a more severe condition like meningitis. Pseudotumor cerebri (Option C) is a rare condition in children under 10 years old and is often associated with obesity, female gender, and certain medications (like lithium, tetracyclines, steroid withdrawal and hypervitaminosis A). It presents with increased intracranial pressure but does not typically cause fever, bulging fontanelle, or abnormal twitching. It usually has a chronic course and presents with papilledema in most cases. Intracranial hemorrhage (Option D) can lead to seizures or abnormal movements, it generally presents with more pronounced neurological deficits such as altered consciousness, focal neurological findings, or altered tone, and is less likely to cause fever and bulging fontanelle, which are more indicative of meningitis.

      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: A) Corticosteroids Explanation: In case of severe COVID, where SpO2 < 90%, due to inflammatory damage to alveoli, the corticosteroid is administered to reduce inflammation and improve oxygenation. Treatment Protocols for COVID-19 Mild Disease Home Management & Hydration Medications: Use paracetamol for fever and nasal saline drops for congestion. Avoid antibiotics and multivitamins (no proven benefit). Monitoring: Watch for red flag signs like rapid breathing, oxygen saturation below 95%, persistent fever, lethargy, or poor feeding. Moderate Disease Admit to Covid ward SpO2 > 94: Hydration, paracetamol and antimicrobials SpO2 < 94: Oxygen, IV Steroids, Remdesivir, Antimicrobials Severe/Critical Covid - 19 ICU / HDU ward Oxygen, CPAP, Invasive ventilation if required IV corticosteroids , Remdesivir (controversial) , Enoxaparin, Antimicrobials Manage Shock, ARDS, AKI, and Myocarditis as per protocol Steroids: Administer IV dexamethasone at 0.15 mg/kg (max 6 mg) once daily for 5-14 days. Remdesivir should be administered only in a hospital setting. Enoxaparin: For <2 months: 1.5 mg/kg/dose every 12 hours. For >2 months: 1 mg/kg/dose every 12 hours. Ivermectin (Option B) was earlier thought to have antiviral properties, but evidence shows there is no decrease in mortality and hospital stay. Hence it is not recommended to be used for COVID-19. There is controversy in the use of Remdesivir (Option C) between guidelines given by IAP and MoHFW. As per IAP, Remdesivir can be used at more than 1 month of age, for moderate to severe COVID-19 disease in hospital settings. However, as per MOHFW, remdesivir is not recommended in children. There is a lack of sufficient evidence on safety and efficacy concerning Remdesivir in children below 18 years of age. Reference: O.P. Ghai Essential Pediatrics, 10th Edition, Page: 227, 228.",

      "correct_answer": "D",
      "explanation": "infection Correct Answer: D) If the mother is lgG positive for CMV, the child is unlikely to develop an infection. Explanation: IgG antibodies can cross the placenta and provide passive immunity to infants . In the case of congenital CMV infection, if the mother was previously infected and is IgG positive , she would provide passive immunity to the fetus thus making it unlikely for the fetus to develop an infection. Congenital CMV infection can be described as follows: Human cytomegalovirus (CMV) Mode of Transmission Bodily fluids: saliva, urine, blood, vaginal fluids, breast milk Community exposure: Daycare centres Perinatal exposure: During birth Breastfeeding Risk of Transmission 30% of women with primary CMV infection during pregnancy transmit the virus to the fetus. In-utero infections also occur in previously immune women but at a reduced rate Transmission by Gestational Age Transmission rates are higher following a primary infection, with the risk increasing as gestational age advances. Clinical Features of congenital CMV infection Asymptomatic Infection (90% of infected newborns): No signs at birth; detected through newborn screening. Symptomatic Infection (10% of infected newborns (vs Option A) ) : Jaundice (direct bilirubin >2 mg/dL) Petechiae (small, red, or purple spots on the skin) giving a blueberry muffin appearance Hepatosplenomegaly Microcephaly Intrauterine growth restriction Chorioretinitis Purpura (3% infants) (larger areas of bleeding under the skin) Less Common Findings: Hearing loss (M/c long-term consequence; may develop later). Lab findings align with the clinical presentation: Direct hyperbilirubinemia, I ALT, thrombocytopenia, and Head CT abnormalities Triad of SNHL, periventricular calcification and enamel hypoplasia (seen in congenital syphilis) (Option C) is not seen in congenital CMV infection.

Transmission Contact with droplet aerosols (through the respiratory tract or conjunctiva) Pathogenesis Primary viremia occurs, resulting in infection of the reticuloendothelial system, followed by secondary viremia, which results in systemic symptoms. Incubation period 8-12 days Period of infectivity From 3 days before to 4 days after the rash onset Clinical manifestations Common in preschool children Prodromal phase: Fever (before rash), rhinorrhea, conjunctival congestion and a dry hacking cough. Koplik spots , pathognomonic for measles, appear on the 2nd or 3rd day of illness as grey-white, sand-like lesions with surrounding erythema on the buccal mucosa opposite the lower second molars. Rash The erythematous maculopapular rash in measles appears on the 4th day, starting behind the ears, along the hairline, and posterior cheeks, then spreading to the rest of the body over the next 2-3 days.

      "explanation": "Correct Answer: A) Rubella Explanation: The patent ductus arteriosus, bilateral cataracts, and salt & pepper retinopathy are classical signs of congenital rubella syndrome. Congenital Rubella Rubella (German measles) is a mild disease in infants and children but can cause congenital rubella syndrome (CRS) if contracted during pregnancy. The risk is highest in the first trimester, especially within the first 8 weeks. Pathogenesis Viremia is most intense from 10 to 17 days after infection. Viral shedding is from day 10 of infection up to 2 weeks. Risk of Defects by Gestational Age Highest in the first 12 weeks of gestation and decreases significantly thereafter, with defects being rare after 20 weeks. Clinical features of congenital rubella syndrome Hearing loss (most common) Vision problems ( cataracts , glaucoma, salt and pepper retinopathy ). Cataracts are the most common ocular abnormality associated with congenital rubella. Heart defects ( patent ductus arteriosus > pulmonary artery stenosis (right > left) > ventricular septal defect) Low birth weight Neurological issues (microcephaly, intellectual disabilities, encephalitis, behavioural issues) Chronicity and Complications Chronic presence of the virus can cause ongoing damage The risk of progressive rubella panencephalitis (PRP) years later is a rare complication. Less common complications: Growth retardation, hepatitis, bone lesions. Risk of diabetes and thyroid dysfunction Diagnosis Rubella IgM enzyme immunosorbent assay (detects antibodies) Viral isolation (growing the virus from samples) Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) (detects viral RNA) Management No specific treatment for CRS; supportive care is key Early intervention for complications (e.g., hearing loss) is crucial Prevention Standard with droplet precaution in hospitalized cases Rubella vaccination RA 27/3 live attenuated vaccine (MMR or MMRV with varicella) effectively prevents rubella and CRS MMR vaccine has a 95% efficacy after one dose and 99% after two doses Vaccination side effects: fever, rash, joint pain Considerations for Pregnant Women Immunoglobulin may be considered if pregnancy is not terminated, though it does not guarantee prevention of fetal infection Congenital CMV infection (Option B) is usually asymptomatic at birth. If symptomatic, these neonates present with jaundice, petechiae, hepatosplenomegaly, microcephaly, and chorioretinitis. Congenital toxoplasmosis (Option C) caused by Toxoplasma gondii often presents with the classic triad of intracranial calcifications, hydrocephalus, and chorioretinitis Congenital varicella (Option D) presents with cicatricial zigzag skin scarring in a dermatomal pattern, limb hypoplasia, microcephaly, seizures, mental retardation, chorioretinitis, microphthalmia, cataracts, etc.",

Caused By Group A Streptococcus (GAS) Incidence and Virulence Less common and less virulent now compared to the past, with incidence depending on toxin strains and the population immunity. Clinical Features Rash appears within 24-48 hours , starting around the neck and spreading to the trunk and extremities. Rash is a diffuse, finely papular, erythematous eruption causing bright-red discoloration, which blanches on pressure. Rash is accentuated in the creases of the elbow, axilla, and groin (Pastia lines) and gives the skin a goose-pimple appearance. Erythematous cheeks with pallor around the mouth. After 3-4 days, the rash fades, followed by desquamation starting on the face and progressing downward. Desquamation may occur around fingernails, palms, and soles. Tongue is coated with swollen papillae, which later give a \"strawberry tongue\" appearance after desquamation. Pharyngitis. Diagnosis Classic scarlet fever is typically straightforward to diagnose. A history of recent exposure to GAS is helpful. Diagnosis is confirmed by identifying GAS in the pharynx. Treatment Antibiotic therapy should be started immediately. Drug of choice: Penicillin or amoxicillin for 10 days. Alternative for Penicillin Allergy: Oral cephalosporins, clindamycin, Macrolides (erythromycin, clarithromycin) for 10 days or azalide (azithromycin) for 5 days.

This is because a significantly low platelet count is directly associated with a higher risk of bleeding complications and is crucial for determining the management and prognosis of the condition. Incorrect Options: Option B - Elevated total leukocyte count (TLC) : While an elevated TLC may indicate an underlying infection or inflammation, it is less directly related to the prognosis of bleeding risk compared to platelet count. In conditions with bleeding, the platelet count is a more immediate indicator of potential complications. Option C - Hematocrit : Hematocrit measures the proportion of blood volume occupied by red blood cells. While it can provide information on anemia or blood volume status, it is not the primary prognostic factor for bleeding disorders related to low platelet counts. Option D - Peripheral smear : A peripheral smear can reveal the morphology of blood cells and help in diagnosing various hematological conditions.

      "correct_answer": "D",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: D) Congenital rubella syndrome Explanation: The clinical presentation of deafness, cataract, and patent ductus arteriosus in an infant is most suggestive of Congenital rubella syndrome . Congenital rubella Rubella (German measles) is a mild disease in infants and children but can cause congenital rubella syndrome (CRS) if contracted during pregnancy. The risk is highest in the first trimester, especially within the first 8 weeks. Pathogenesis Viremia is most intense from 10 to 17 days after infection. Viral shedding is from day 10 of infection up to 2 weeks. Risk of Defects by Gestational Age Highest in the first 12 weeks of gestation and decreases significantly thereafter, with defects being rare after 20 weeks. Clinical features of congenital rubella syndrome Sensorineural hearing loss (SNHL) (most common) Vision problems ( cataracts , glaucoma, salt and pepper retinopathy). Cataracts are the most common ocular abnormality associated with congenital rubella. \\ Heart defects ( patent ductus arteriosus > pulmonary artery stenosis (right > left) > ventricular septal defect) Low birth weight Neurological issues (microcephaly, intellectual disabilities, encephalitis, behavioral issues) Chronicity and Complications Chronic presence of the virus can cause ongoing damage The risk of progressive rubella panencephalitis (PRP) years later is a rare complication. Less common complications: Growth retardation, hepatitis, bone lesions. Risk of diabetes and thyroid dysfunction Diagnosis Rubella IgM enzyme immunosorbent assay (detects antibodies) Viral isolation (growing the virus from samples) Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) (detects viral RNA) Management No specific treatment for CRS; supportive care is key Early intervention for complications (e.g., hearing loss) is crucial Prevention Standard with droplet precaution in hospitalized cases Rubella vaccination RA 27/3 live attenuated vaccine (MMR or MMRV with varicella) effectively prevents rubella and CRS MMR vaccine has a 95% efficacy after one dose and 99% after two doses Vaccination side effects: fever, rash, joint pain Considerations for Pregnant Women Immunoglobulin may be considered if pregnancy is not terminated, though it does not guarantee prevention of fetal infection Congenital herpes simplex virus infection (Option A) can be transmitted in utero, during delivery, or in the neonatal period. Intrauterine infection leads to skin vesicles, eye abnormalities such as chorioretinitis and keratoconjunctivitis, and neurological complications like microcephaly or hydranencephaly. Infection acquired at birth can present as localized disease affecting the skin, eyes, and mouth, as encephalitis , or as disseminated infection resembling neonatal sepsis. Congenital toxoplasmosis (Option B) results from maternal infection, particularly during pregnancy. The severity depends on the timing of transmission, with early pregnancy infections leading to more severe outcomes, while later infections tend to be milder. The classic presentation includes a triad of chorioretinitis, hydrocephalus, and intracranial calcifications. Congenital cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection (Option C) is often acquired when maternal infection occurs during pregnancy, with the highest transmission risk in the third trimester. Affected newborns may have growth restriction, microcephaly, periventricular calcifications, chorioretinitis, developmental delays, hepatosplenomegaly, hemolytic anemia, and thrombocytopenia. While many neonates are asymptomatic at birth, sensorineural hearing loss is a common long-term complication.",

      "explanation": "Correct Answer: A) Measles Explanation: The clinical scenario of fever, rash spreading from the face to other body parts, and the presence of Koplik's spots in a child points towards a diagnosis of measles. Measles: Aspects Description Causative agent Measles (rubeola) is a highly communicable childhood exanthematous illness caused by the measles virus, an RNA virus from the Paramyxoviridae family. Transmission Contact with droplet aerosols (through the respiratory tract or conjunctiva) Pathogenesis Primary viremia occurs, resulting in infection of the reticuloendothelial system, followed by secondary viremia, which results in systemic symptoms. Incubation period 8-12 days Period of infectivity From 3 days before to 4 days after the rash onset Clinical manifestations Common in preschool children Prodromal phase: Fever (before rash), rhinorrhea, conjunctival congestion and a dry hacking cough. Koplik spots , pathognomonic for measles, appear on the 2nd or 3rd day of illness as grey-white, sand-like lesions with surrounding erythema on the buccal mucosa opposite the lower second molars. Rash The erythematous maculopapular rash in measles appears on the 4th day, starting behind the ears, along the hairline, and posterior cheeks , then spreading to the rest of the body over the next 2-3 days. Management Symptomatic and conservative (antipyretics, maintenance of hygiene, ensuring adequate fluid and caloric intake, and humidification). Rubella (Option B) presents with low-grade fever, a centrifugal macular rash, and prominent lymphadenopathy, with tiny rose-colored lesions on the soft palate (Forchheimer spots), which are different from Koplik's spots seen in measles. Varicella (Option C) presents with a characteristic pruritic rash that evolves in stages (macules, papules, vesicles, and crusts) and does not present with Koplik's spots. Mumps (Option D) presents with fever, headache, parotitis, and ipsilateral auricular pain, with a morbilliform rash that may occur, but it is not associated with Koplik's spots.",

      "explanation": "Correct Answer: A) Azithromycin Explanation: An infant presenting with paroxysmal cough, apnea, and marked leukocytosis (>50,000 cells/ µ L) is suggestive of pertussis (whooping cough). Azithromycin is the first-line treatment for pertussis in all age groups. Pertussis Causative agent Bordetella pertussis, Bordetella parapertussis Secondary attack rate 100% Clinical Stages Catarrhal (1-2 weeks): Cold-like symptoms, worsening cough Paroxysmal (2-6 weeks): Severe cough, \"whoop\", vomiting Convalescent (1-4 weeks): Recovery Complications Apnea, Otitis media, Pneumonia, Pulmonary hypertension, Cardiogenic shock, Hemorrhage, Seizures, hernia and malnutrition. Diagnosis Clinical signs, nasopharyngeal swab culture, PCR, serology. Differential Diagnosis Adenoviral infection, TB, foreign body inhalation, airway compression. Management First-line antibiotics for treating pertussis: Azithromycin is the first-line treatment for pertussis in all age groups. Erythromycin and clarithromycin are alternative treatments but are C/I in <1 month old due to risk for infantile hypertrophic pyloric stenosis (IHPS). (Option D) Alternative antibiotics: For patients allergic to macrolides or there is unavailability of azithromycin, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (cotrimoxazole) may be used, but it is C/I in <2 months old (due to the risk for kernicterus ) (Option C) Timing of treatment: Antibiotics are most effective during the catarrhal stage Isolation: Patients diagnosed with pertussis should be isolated from others, especially vulnerable populations like infants and the elderly, for at least 5 days after starting antibiotics . Prevention DTaP vaccine (Diphtheria, Tetanus, and Pertussis): Given to children under 7 years of age as part of routine childhood vaccinations. Tdap vaccine (Tetanus, Diphtheria, and Pertussis): Recommended for adolescents, adults, and pregnant women (preferably between 27 and 36 weeks gestation) to provide protection and reduce transmission to infants. Amoxicillin (Option B) is not used in pertussis because it is ineffective against Bordetella pertussis in the nasopharynx. Reference: Nelson Textbook of Pediatrics, 21st Edition, Page 1492- 1496 O.P.
