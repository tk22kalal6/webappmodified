Neurofibromatosis Type 2 (NF2) Less Common : NF2 is rarer than NF1. Inheritance : Autosomal dominant; affects Schwann cells, leading to tumors on nerve insulation. Incidence : 1 in 25,000 births. Genetic Location : NF2 gene on chromosome 22q1.11. Diagnosis Criteria (Manchester & Baser Criteria) NF2 is diagnosed with one of the following: (Mnemonic: MISME- Multiple inherited schwannomas meningioma and ependymoma) Bilateral Vestibular Schwannomas . Family History + either: Unilateral vestibular schwannoma Any two of the following: meningioma, schwannoma, glioma, neurofibroma, or posterior subcapsular lenticular opacities. Unilateral Vestibular Schwannoma + any two of the features above. Multiple Meningiomas ( ≥ 2) + either: Unilateral vestibular schwannoma Any two of the above-listed features. Clinical Manifestations Common Symptoms : Tinnitus Hearing loss Facial weakness Headache Unsteadiness Age of Onset : Symptoms usually emerge in childhood; cerebellopontine angle masses are common in 20s-30s. Other Signs : Childhood: Café-au-lait macules (CALMs), skin plexiform schwannomas Posterior subcapsular lens opacities in ~50% of cases. Genetics Mutation : NF2 gene mutation leads to loss of merlin/schwannomin protein. Management Approach : Conservative management focusing on hearing preservation and quality of life.
