      "question": "A 5-year-old unimmunized child presents to the OPD with a fully immunized 2-year-old sibling. Upon inspection, a white membranous layer is observed in the throat of the 5-year-old. What is the next step in management for the contact?",
      "options": {
        "A": "Diphtheria toxoid bolus",
        "B": "Diphtheria toxin",
        "C": "Penicillin",
        "D": "No treatment is needed"
      },
      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: C) Penicillin Explanation: In the case of suspected diphtheria, close contacts , even if asymptomatic, should receive antibiotic prophylaxis (either a single intramuscular dose of benzathine penicillin or a 7â€“10 day course of oral erythromycin ), especially if the contact is a household member or a child in close proximity to the case. Booster dose of diphtheria toxoid if immunization is incomplete or unknown Even fully immunized individuals may benefit from antibiotic prophylaxis due to the potential for asymptomatic carriage and transmission . Diphtheria toxoid bolus (Option A): This is incorrect terminology. While booster immunization with diphtheria toxoid is advised for contacts if their immunization status is incomplete or unknown, this does not replace the need for antibiotic prophylaxis . Also, the word \"bolus\" is not appropriate for toxoid administration. Diphtheria toxin (Option B): This is incorrect and dangerous. The toxin is the virulent agent produced by Corynebacterium diphtheriae and is responsible for systemic effects like myocarditis and neuropathy. Toxoid , not toxin, is used in vaccines. No treatment is needed (Option D): This is incorrect. Even fully immunized contacts require evaluation and possibly prophylactic antibiotics due to risk of carriage and spread . Surveillance and monitoring are essential.

      "question": "In which of the following conditions is live vaccination not contraindicated? DiGeorge syndrome Wiskott Aldrich Syndrome Ataxia telangiectasia Complement deficiency",
      "options": {
        "A": "4 only",
        "B": "1 only",
        "C": "1 and 3",
        "D": "2 and 3"
      },
      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: A) 4 only Explanation: Live vaccines are typically contraindicated in conditions associated with impaired T-cell immunity, as individuals with such deficiencies are at risk for severe infections due to their inability to mount an adequate immune response to live pathogens. This includes DiGeorge syndrome, Wiskott-Aldrich Syndrome, and Ataxia telangiectasia. In contrast, patients with complement deficiencies have normal T-cell and B-cell functions. They may have an increased susceptibility to certain bacterial infections, particularly those caused by Neisseria species, due to defective complement-mediated immunity. However, their adaptive immune system, which is responsible for responding to vaccines, remains intact. Therefore, live vaccinations are generally not contraindicated in complement deficiency. DiGeorge syndrome (1) involves a defect in the development of the thymus, leading to T-cell deficiency and impaired cell-mediated immunity. As a result, live vaccines should be avoided due to the increased risk of severe infections. Wiskott-Aldrich Syndrome (2) is caused by mutations in the Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome protein (WASP), leading to T-cell dysfunction. Live vaccines are contraindicated in these patients because of their compromised immune system. Ataxia telangiectasia (3) results from mutations in the ATM gene, impairing DNA repair mechanisms and leading to T-cell deficiency. Live vaccines are avoided due to the risk of severe infection.

      "question": "What should be the course of action for the newborn if the mother, who is a first-time pregnant woman, arrives at the hospital at 37 weeks of pregnancy with no prior antenatal check-ups and is currently in labor, while also testing positive for Hepatitis B?",
      "options": {
        "A": "Hep B vaccine only",
        "B": "Hep B vaccine + immunoglobulin",
        "C": "First immunoglobulin, then Hep B vaccine after 1 month",
        "D": "Only immunoglobulin"
      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "vaccine and immunoglobulin (HBIG) is the preferred management given to the neonate. It gives both immediate and long-term protection against Hepatitis B to the baby. It protects the neonate from the vertical transmission of the virus. The vaccine stimulates the baby's immune system to produce antibodies against the virus, while the immunoglobulin provides immediate passive immunity. Incorrect options: Option A. Hep B Vaccine only is insufficient for managing a neonate born to a Hepatitis B positive mother. Option C. It is essential to give the Hepatitis B vaccine and immunoglobulin to the neonate shortly after birth. Delaying the vaccine for a month would not provide immediate protection. Option D. Hepatitis B immunoglobulin is necessary. But it should be administered with the Hepatitis B vaccine for better management.",

It is usually recommended that children continue their routine vaccination schedule for OPV unless they are severely ill. Incorrect options: Option A is Incorrect because for leukemia it is contraindicated to give OPV vaccine as it can alter the immune responses or even increase the risk of complications. Option C is Incorrect because, for Malignancy, it is contraindicated to give OPV vaccine as it can alter the immune responses or even increase the risk of complications. Option D is Incorrect because, for Immunocompromised, it is contraindicated to give OPV vaccine as it can alter the immune responses or even increase the risk of complications.

Incorrect Options: Option A - Alport syndrome: Alport syndrome is caused by mutations in genes encoding type IV collagen, not the NPHS1 gene. Option C - Focal Segmental Glomerulonephritis: Focal Segmental Glomerulosclerosis (FSGS) has various genetic and non-genetic causes, but NPHS1 gene mutations are not typically associated with it.
