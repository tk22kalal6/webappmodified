      "question": "A 2-month-old child presents with watery eyes and photophobia. All of the following conditions can cause these symptoms, except?",
      "options": {
        "A": "Congenital glaucoma",
        "B": "Congenital NLD blockage",
        "C": "Congenital entropion",
        "D": "Congenital distichiasis"
      },
      "correct_answer": "D",
      "explanation": "rows of eye lashes. The inner row of eyelashes is not necessarily turned towards the cornea so it is less likely to cause irritation, lacrimation, and photophobia. Incorrect options: Option A - Congenital glaucoma: The triad of lacrimation, photophobia, and blepharospasm is seen in congenital glaucoma. Option B - Congenital NLD blockage: Congenital NLD blockage is characterized by blockage of the drainage of tears, which leads to lacrimation, which in turn can cause photophobia. Option C - Congenital entropion: Inturning of the eyelashes causes rubbing against the cornea causing irritation, resulting in watering. If an opacity forms due to continuous rubbing by eyelashes, it will lead to photophobia.",

      "question": "A 6-year-old child presented to emergency department with complaints of bleeding from the nose. Which of the following artery is most affected?",
      "options": {
        "A": "Anterior ethmoidal artery",
        "B": "Posterior ethmoidal artery",
        "C": "Sphenopalatine artery",
        "D": "Greater palatine artery"
      },
      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "artery and is a common source of nosebleeds, especially in children. It supplies blood to the lateral wall of the nasal cavity, including the Kiesselbach's plexus, which is a region known for its vulnerability to bleeding. In a 6-year-old child, nosebleeds often occur in this region due to fragile blood vessels. Incorrect Options: Option A - Anterior ethmoidal artery: This artery supplies blood to the anterior part of the nasal cavity and the ethmoidal sinuses. Bleeding from this artery could lead to epistaxis (nosebleeds), but it is less likely to be the primary source of bleeding in a 6-year-old child. Option B - Posterior ethmoidal artery: This artery supplies blood to the posterior part of the nasal cavity and the ethmoidal sinuses. Similar to the anterior ethmoidal artery, bleeding from this artery could contribute to nosebleeds, but it is less commonly the primary source of bleeding, especially in a 6-year-old child. Option D - Greater palatine artery: This artery supplies the hard palate, which is the roof of the mouth. While bleeding from this artery could potentially cause oral bleeding, it is not a common source of nosebleeds, especially in a 6-year-old child.",

      "question": "Which of the following is not a correct match for ABCD according to pediatric advanced life support?",
      "options": {
        "A": "Airway",
        "B": "Breathing",
        "C": "Circulation",
        "D": "Dehydration"
      },
      "correct_answer": "D",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer D - Dehydration Pediatric Advanced Life Support (PALS) uses the ABCD approach to manage pediatric emergencies. ABCD stands for: A = Airway (Option A) B = Breathing (Option B) C = Circulation (Option C) D = Disability Dehydration is not part of the ABCD approach in PALS , although it can be a concern in pediatric emergencies. Components of PALS Assessment: Airway: Assess airway patency (open/patent, unobstructed/obstructed) and determine if the patient will need assistance maintaining their airway Breathing: Assess respiratory rate, respiratory effort, lung sounds, airway sounds, chest movement, and oxygen saturation via pulse oximetry Circulation: Assess heart rate, heart rhythm, pulses, skin color, skin temperature, capillary refill time, and blood pressure Disability: Assess neurological function with the AVPU pediatric response scale (alert, voice, painful, unresponsive), pediatric Glasgow Coma Scale (eye opening, motor response, verbal response), pupil response to light (normal, pinpoint, dilated, unilateral dilated), and blood glucose test (hypoglycemia can cause altered mental status) Exposure: Assess temperature, signs of trauma (cuts, bleeding, bruises, burns, etc.), and skin (petechiae, purpura, etc.) Reference: Nelson Textbook of Pediatrics, 21st edition, Page 515-525 https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7576321/",

      "question": "What is the probable diagnosis for a 7-year-old girl who presents with cramping abdominal pain, rashes on the back of her legs, buttocks, and extensor surface of her forearms, along with proteinuria and microscopic hematuria upon laboratory analysis?",
      "options": {
        "A": "Systemic lupus erythematosus",
        "B": "Henoch-Schonlein purpura",
        "C": "Post-streptococcal glomerulonephritis",
        "D": "Hemolytic uremic syndrome"
      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "surface of the forearms, along with laboratory findings of proteinuria and microscopic hematuria, suggest Henoch-Schonlein purpura (HSP) as the most likely diagnosis. HSP is a systemic vasculitis affecting small vessels, primarily in children. The classic presentation includes palpable purpura on the lower extremities, abdominal pain, arthritis or arthralgia, and renal involvement (hematuria, proteinuria, and occasionally, nephrotic syndrome). The diagnosis of HSP is made based on clinical features and laboratory findings, and a renal biopsy is rarely necessary. Incorrect Choices: a. Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) typically presents with more symptoms, including fatigue, joint pain, and skin rashes, and is less common in children. Laboratory findings in SLE include positive antinuclear antibodies and anti-double-stranded DNA antibodies, which are not seen in HSP. c. post-streptococcal glomerulonephritis (PSGN) typically presents with edema, hypertension, and oliguria following an upper respiratory or skin infection with group A beta-hemolytic streptococcus. Hematuria, proteinuria, and red blood cell casts are commonly seen on urinalysis. HSP is not typically associated with preceding infections and does not have hypertension or oliguria. d. Hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS) typically presents with the triad of microangiopathic hemolytic anemia, thrombocytopenia, and acute renal failure. While HSP can cause renal involvement, it typically presents with isolated proteinuria and microscopic hematuria without the other features of HUS. Reference: .",
