      "question": "A 7-year-old child from a region with known iodine deficiency presents to the clinic with symptoms including developmental delay, short stature, and coarse facial features. The child’s parents report a high prevalence of goiter in their community. To prevent similar cases in the future, which of the following preventive measures is the most appropriate?",
      "options": {
        "A": "Prescribing high-dose thyroid hormone replacement therapy",
        "B": "Recommending the use of iodinated salt or iodized oil",
        "C": "Advising on a diet high in vegetables and fruits",
        "D": "Performing regular thyroid function tests for all community members"
      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: B) Recommending the use of iodinated salt or iodized oil Explanation: Iodine deficiency disorders, including endemic cretinism, are best prevented through the use of iodinated salt or iodized oil. This approach addresses the root cause of iodine deficiency and is effective in preventing the associated disorders. Endemic Cretinism: Endemic cretinism is associated with endemic goiter and severe iodine deficiency. It manifests in two main forms: neurological cretinism and myxedematous cretinism A 14-year-old boy with a large nodular goiter - in an area of severe iodine-deficiency disorders in northern Morocco. Types of Endemic Cretinism: Neurological Cretinism : Characterized by deaf-mutism, squint, proximal spasticity and rigidity, and severe intellectual disability. Myxedematous Cretinism : Characterized by less severe intellectual impairment, severe short stature, coarse facial features, and myxedema. Prevention and Control: Prevention : Iodine deficiency disorders are best prevented through iodinated salt or iodized oil, as treatment is largely ineffective. Treatment : While signs of hypothyroidism may improve, neuromotor and intellectual deficiencies are irreversible. Surgical removal of large goiters is reserved for airway obstruction or cosmetic reasons. National Goiter Control Program (India): Launched in 1962 to control iodine deficiency disorders through salt iodination. Recommended daily iodine intake: 40-120 µg for children under 10 years. 150 µg for older children and adults. Additional 25-50 µg during pregnancy and lactation. Prescribing high-dose thyroid hormone replacement therapy (Option A): This option is not a preventive measure. While thyroid hormone replacement therapy can treat hypothyroidism and its symptoms, it does not prevent iodine deficiency or its associated disorders, such as endemic cretinism. Advising",

In pheochromocytoma, there is an increase in urinary VMA (Vanillyl mandelic acid) and metanephrines. A Plasma fractionated metanephrines test is the most appropriate initial diagnostic test to confirm. Pheochromocytoma: A catecholamine-secreting tumor that arises from the chromaffin cells of the abdominal sympathetic chain/ adrenal medulla Co-exist with neurofibromatosis, VHL syndrome, MEN syndrome Clinical features: Classical triad - Headache (most common), profuse sweating, palpitation and tachycardia Hypertension (sustained or intermittent) Anxiety, panic attacks Hyperglycemia and Hypercalcemia Pallor- due to alpha-1 mediated vasoconstriction Polyuria and polydipsia Orthostatic hypotension Dilated cardiomyopathy Erythrocytosis Constipation Abdominal pain Weakness Weight Loss The rule of 10 in Pheochromocytoma includes: 10% are bilateral 10% are extra-adrenal 10% are malignant 25-33% are inherited Symptomatic patients do not follow the Rule of 10’s Diagnosis: Measurement of the plasma fractionated metanephrines is the most sensitive screening test Increase 24 hour urinary VMA(Vanillyl mandelic acid) and metanephrines MRI is the investigation of choice.

      },
      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "diagnostic test is a 24-hour urinary-free cortisol test because it effectively screens for excess cortisol production indicative of Cushing syndrome. Causes of Cushing’s Syndrome: Exogenous causes (Iatrogenic) Prolonged administration of glucocorticoids (the most common cause of Cushing’s). ACTH dependent Cushing’s disease: ACTH-secreting pituitary adenoma( most common) Hypothalamic lesions Ectopic source - Neuroblastoma, Wilms tumor, Carcinoid syndrome ACTH independent Adrenal adenoma/ carcinoma Pigmented nodular hyperplasia McCune Albright syndrome Clinical Features: Obesity, striae Moon facies, and buffalo hump Short stature Hypertension Bone pains Muscle weakness Behavioral problems Hirsutism Diagnosis: Screening test Loss in diurnal cortisol rhythm Overnight Dexamethasone suppression test: Plasma cortisol >1.8microgram at 8 a.m after overnight exposure to dexamethasone (1mg given at 11 p.m) 24hr urinary free cortisol excretion: Increased three times the normal value High-dose dexamethasone suppression test differentiates between pituitary and ectopic ACTH production; high doses of dexamethasone suppress ACTH levels in pituitary lesions but not in ectopic ACTH cases. Low dose dexamethasone suppression test (highly specific test): ACTH levels: a) <5pg/ml: ACTH independent cause b) 5-15pg/ml: ACTH-dependent cause c) 100pg/ml: Ectopic ACTH The best test to identify the source of ACTH production - Inferior petrosal sinus sampling Test to rule out pseudo-Cushing’s syndrome: Low-dose DST+CRH stimulation test: Plasma cortisol levels are increased in true Cushing’s but remain unaffected in pseudo-Cushing’s. Dexa-induced negative feedback is overcome by CRH in true Cushing's. Treatment: Surgical resection of pituitary/ adrenal lesions Medical: Metyrapone, Ketoconazole, Mitotane Overnight Dexamethasone suppression test (Option B) : Plasma cortisol >1.8 microgram at 8 a.m. after overnight exposure to dexamethasone (1mg given at 11 p.m.). This test helps to differentiate between Cushing syndrome and other causes of elevated cortisol. Serum cortisol level measurement at 8 AM (Option C) - this is less specific and can be influenced by the body’s natural cortisol rhythm. ACTH stimulation test (Option D) : This test assesses the adrenal gland’s response to ACTH and is typically used to elevate adrenal insufficiency or the cause of Cushing syndrome rather than as an initial diagnostic test.",

        "D": "Cushing’s syndrome"
      },
      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "Primary adrenal insufficiency, also known as Addison’s disease, which is characterized by damage to the adrenal glands leading to low cortisol and high ACTH levels. The increased levels of adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) cause hyperpigmentation of the skin due to the conversion of pro-opiomelanocortin (POMC) to melanocyte-stimulating hormone (MSH). Etiology: Primary adrenal insufficiency Secondary adrenal insufficiency Autoimmune mediated/Addison disease Infections: TB/HIV Adrenal Hemorrhage( Waterhouse- Friderichsen syndrome) CAH due to 3 beta -HSD deficiency Anatomical destruction of the gland Surgical removal Amyloidosis, sarcoidosis, hemochromatosis Congenital malformations( e.g. Holoprosencephaly) Acquired insults (CNS trauma, surgery, irradiation) Pituitary tumors Sudden discontinuation of steroids after prolonged treatment Genetic defects Clinical features: Hyperpigmentation seen in primary Adrenal insufficiency- seen in palmar creases, dorsal aspect of the foot, nipples, and axillary region Dehydration- lethargy Shock Abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, salt cravings Hypoglycemia Dizziness and postural hypotension Hyponatremia Loss of libido Loss of pubic and axillary hair Anorexia, weight loss, fatigue, myalgia, arthralgia Investigations: Treatment: Acute adrenal insufficiency requires immediate initiation of the following therapeutic strategies: Rehydration - saline infusion at an initial rate of 1 l/hr with continuous cardiac monitoring. Glucocorticoid replacement - bolus injection of 100 mg hydrocortisone, followed by the maintenance dose of 100-200mg over 24hr Mineralocorticoid replacement - initiated once the daily hydrocortisone dose has been reduced to <50 mg as higher doses of hydrocortisone have sufficient mineralocorticoid action. Secondary adrenal insufficiency (Option B) is caused by inadequate ACTH secretion from the pituitary gland. This leads to low cortisol levels but normal or low ACTH levels. Tertiary adrenal insufficiency (Option C) results from inadequate corticotropin-releasing hormone production from the hypothalamus, leading to low ACTH and cortisol levels. Cushing’s syndrome (Option D) is characterized by excess cortisol levels. Symptoms include weight gain, hypertension, and moon facies, but not typically low cortisol levels or high ACTH levels with skin hyperpigmentation.",

      "explanation": "Correct Answer: B) 21-Hydroxylase deficiency with salt-wasting form; elevated 17-OHP levels the salt-wasting form of 21-hydroxylase deficiency. This severe form results in almost absent enzyme activity, leading to critical electrolyte imbalances. The definitive diagnostic test for this condition is measuring extremely elevated levels of 17-hydroxyprogesterone (17-OHP), which typically exceeds 10000 ng/dL in salt-wasting forms. 21-Hydroxylase Deficiency Most common form of CAH (90%) Enzyme Affected: 21-hydroxylase Pathogenesis 21-hydroxylase deficiency impairs the synthesis of cortisol and aldosterone. Low cortisol levels lead to elevated ACTH levels. Elevated ACTH causes the accumulation of steroid precursors, including dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA), androstenedione, and 17-hydroxyprogesterone (17-OHP). Clinical Manifestations Salt-Wasting Form: Severe deficiency with nearly absent enzyme activity. Presents in neonates with salt-wasting, virilization, ambiguous genitalia in girls, failure to thrive, polyuria, hyperpigmentation, and shock. Diagnosis may be missed in boys. Simple Virilizing Form: Partial enzyme activity (25%) allows aldosterone production. Features include virilization in girls and peripheral precocious puberty in boys . (Option A) Non-Classic Form: Mild enzyme deficiency with mild hyperandrogenism. Symptoms include hirsutism, acne, and menstrual irregularities in adolescents. (Option C) Diagnosis Salt-Wasting Form: Extreme elevations of 17-OHP levels (10000-20000 ng/dL, normal <200 ng/dL) in the context of clinical signs of adrenal insufficiency. Simple Virilizing and Non-Classic Forms: Elevated 17-OHP levels measured before and 60 minutes after an intramuscular ACTH injection (0.25 mg). Treatment Salt-wasting and Virilizing Forms treated with Hydrocortisone (10-15 mg/m²/day) and Fludrocortisone (0.1 mg/day). Long-acting glucocorticoid preparations (dexamethasone or prednisolone) may be used after growth and puberty are complete. 11-Hydroxylase Deficiency; Hydrocortisone alone (Option D); 11-Hydroxylase deficiency typically presents with hypertension rather than the salt-wasting and ambiguous genitalia seen in the scenario.

      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: B) Methimazole Explanation: The most appropriate initial treatment for this 10-year-old girl with symptoms suggestive of hyperthyroidism (weight loss, increased appetite, heat intolerance, palpitations, tremors, and neck swelling) is Methimazole. The dosage is 0.5-1.0 mg/kg/day in 3-4 divided doses. Hyperthyroidism in Children Etiology: Infancy: Transplacental passage of thyroid antibodies, TSH receptor activating mutation. After Infancy: Graves disease (TSH receptor stimulating antibody), toxic thyroid nodule, toxic multinodular goiter, pituitary resistance to T3. Transient: Release of preformed thyroid hormone due to viral or bacterial infections of the thyroid (acute or subacute thyroiditis), early Hashimoto thyroiditis (Hashitoxicosis), iatrogenic. Clinical Features: Symptoms: Weight loss with increased appetite, tremors, diarrhea, warm extremities, increased sweating, anxiety, inability to concentrate, personality changes, mood instability, and poor school performance. Signs: Firm homogeneous goiter, tachycardia, cardiac arrhythmia, high output cardiac failure. Eye Signs: Less common in children compared to adults; may include lid lag, ophthalmoplegia, absence of wrinkling, chemosis, and proptosis. Diagnosis: Elevated serum FT4 and FT3 levels confirm diagnosis. Goiter, eye signs, and hyperthyroidism suggest Graves disease. Diffusely increased radiotracer uptake suggests Graves disease; reduced uptake indicates AIT. Management: Medication: Antithyroid Drugs: Initially started with Methimazole (0.5-1.0 mg/kg/day in 3-4 divided doses). Propylthiouracil is contraindicated due to hepatotoxicity. (Option A) It is typically reserved for specific situations, such as during the first trimester of pregnancy or in cases of methimazole intolerance. Beta-Blockers: Propranolol (2 mg/kg/day in 2-3 divided doses) to manage sympathetic symptoms. (Option D) It is used to manage the adrenergic symptoms (e.g., tremors, anxiety, palpitations) of hyperthyroidism, but it does not treat the underlying cause. It is often used in conjunction with antithyroid drugs like methimazole. Corticosteroids: Prednisolone (1-2 mg/kg/day) for hyperthyroid storm and to inhibit peripheral conversion of T4 to T3. (Option C) It is not an initial treatment for hyperthyroidism. Surgery and Radioiodine: Considered for patients with failure of medical management or relapse. Surgery: Partial or total thyroidectomy for large or toxic nodular goiter. Radioiodine: Increasingly used in childhood Graves disease. Reference: OP GHAI Essentials of Pediatrics. 10th edition.

Option A: Observation is not recommended as the patient has a confirmed diagnosis of IGHD and would benefit from prompt treatment. Option C: Genetic testing for PROP1 mutations is not necessary at this point, as PROP1 mutations typically cause multiple pituitary hormone deficiencies, which is not the case here. Option D: Monotherapy with gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonist is not appropriate for a 6-year-old boy and is not the primary treatment for IGHD. However, gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonist is adjuvantly used in the hope that interruption of puberty will delay epiphyseal fusion to reach the target height.

      "question": "A 10-year-old child presents with excessive thirst and frequent urination for the past several months, causing him to wake up multiple times at night to drink water. Lab tests show hypernatremia and dilute urine with low urine osmolality. What is the most appropriate treatment for managing his condition?",
      "options": {
        "A": "Insulin therapy",
        "B": "Desmopressin",
        "C": "Metformin",
        "D": "Spironolactone"
      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "urination, hypernatremia, and dilute urine are consistent with central diabetes insipidus (DI) , a condition caused by a deficiency of antidiuretic hormone (ADH). Desmopressin is a synthetic analog of ADH and is the primary treatment for central diabetes insipidus. It helps to reduce the excessive urine output by mimicking the action of ADH, thus improving the body's ability to concentrate urine Diagnosis: Low urine osmolality (<600 mosm/L) in association with high plasma osmolality {>300 mosm/L} Water deprivation test → differentiates psychogenic polydipsia from DI Water deprivation test Water deprivation test The vasopressin response test → to differentiate central DI and nephrogenic DI An increase in urine osmolality by >50% of the baseline indicates Central DI Treatment: Central DI: Vasopressin analogue (Desmopressin) Nephrogenic DI: Thiazide diuretics, Indomethacin, and salt restriction. Other Uses of Desmopressin include: Central Diabetes Insipidus (CDI) Nocturnal Enuresis Von Willebrand Disease Diagnostic Testing for CDI Temporary treatment of Polyuria-Polydipsia Syndrome Post-lumbar puncture headache (Option B) Insulin therapy is used for managing diabetes mellitus (Option C) Metformin Is used for treating type 2 DM (Option D) Spironolactone is a potassium-sparing diuretic used to treat conditions like hypertension, and edema.",

Laboratory tests reveal: Serum sodium: 147 mEq/L (Normal: 135-145 mEq/L) Serum osmolality: 305 mOsm/kg (Normal: 275-295 mOsm/kg) Urine osmolality: 150 mOsm/kg (Normal: 300-900 mOsm/kg) Urine specific gravity: 1.005 (Normal: 1.005-1.030) A water deprivation test is performed, and after 8 hours, the patient's urine osmolality remains at 200 mOsm/kg. Administration of desmopressin results in a rapid increase in urine osmolality to 600 mOsm/kg within 2 hours. Which of the following is the most characteristic symptom of this condition?",

        "D": "Polyphagia"
      },
      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "inability to concentrate urine leads to large volumes of dilute urine (Polyuria). Polydipsia means excessive thirst because the body tries to compensate for high fluid loss by increasing thirst to encourage more fluid intake. Diabetes insipidus is a condition in which there is the absence of or poor response to anti-diuretic hormone (ADH). This results in reduced distal tubule and collecting duct permeability to water. This causes the kidneys to excrete large amounts of dilute urine that clinically manifests as polyuria and polydipsia. (Option B and D) Polyphagia and hyperglycemia - are symptoms of diabetes mellitus (Option C) Edema is due to fluid retention which is typically not seen in DI Reference: GHAI Essential Pediatrics, 10th edition pg no: 61, 62, 524",

GHRH Deficiency → 3 GHRH : ↓ (primary hypothalamic problem) GH : ↓ (no stimulation) IGF-1 : ↓ (due to GH deficiency) Justification : Since the hypothalamus isn't producing GHRH, pituitary GH is low, leading to reduced IGF-1. b. GHRH Receptor Resistance → 1 GHRH : ↑ or normal (trying to stimulate pituitary) GH : ↓ (pituitary unresponsive to GHRH) IGF-1 : ↓ (low GH activity) Justification : Hypothalamus senses low IGF-1 → increases GHRH, but pituitary cannot respond due to receptor defect. c. GH Deficiency → 1 GHRH : Normal or ↑ (compensatory increase) GH : ↓ (pituitary issue) IGF-1 : ↓ (low GH secretion) Justification : Classic isolated GH deficiency shows low GH/IGF-1 despite normal/high GHRH. d. GH Receptor Resistance (Laron Syndrome) → 2 GHRH : ↑ (due to low IGF-1 feedback) GH : ↑ (pituitary overactive) IGF-1 : ↓ (GH cannot act on liver receptors) Justification : Characteristic of Laron syndrome — high GH, low IGF-1, high GHRH.
