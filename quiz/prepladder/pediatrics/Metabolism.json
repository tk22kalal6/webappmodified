      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "sensorium Correct Answer: C) Venous pH less than 7.15, patient with Kussmaul respirations and depressed sensorium Explanation: This is characteristic of severe DKA, where the patient may progress to a coma if not treated promptly. Kussmaul respirations refer to deep, rapid breathing patterns as a compensatory response to metabolic acidosis. These patients also have a fruity odour in their breath due to acetone. Diabetic Ketoacidosis (DKA): Definition: An acute, life-threatening complication of T1DM due to severe insulin deficiency. Occurs when the body breaks down fat for fuel, leading to ketone production and metabolic acidosis. Classification of DKA: Severity Venous pH Venous CO2 (mEq/L) Clinical Presentation Mild DKA 7.25 - 7.35 (Option A ruled out) 16 - 20 (Option B ruled out) Alert, possible fatigue. Moderate DKA 7.15 - 7.25 10 - 15 (Option D ruled out) Kussmaul respirations, sleepy but arousable. Severe DKA < 7.15 < 10 Kussmaul or depressed respirations, sleepy to coma, severe hypernatremia (Na+ > 150 mEq/L). Reference: Nelson Textbook of Paediatrics, Ed. 21, Pg. 3027, 3028, 3029",

      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: C) Maturity Onset Diabetes of the Young Explanation: Maturity Onset Diabetes of the Young (MODY) is characterized by an autosomal dominant inheritance pattern and is often diagnosed in individuals under 25 years of age. GCK mutations are a common cause of MODY, leading to a mild form of diabetes that does not necessarily require insulin treatment. The patient’s age, symptoms, and GCK mutation make MODY the most likely diagnosis. Aspect Type 1 diabetes mellitus Type 2 diabetes mellitus Maturity onset diabetes of the young (MODY) Latent autoimmune diabetes of adults (LADA/ T1.5 DM) Age at diagnosis 6 mo-18 yrs Puberty; rarely younger than 10 yrs Younger than 25 yrs Age greater than 30 years Causes and genetic factors Autoimmune; genetic predisposition (HLA and other genes) Obesity; genetic and ethnic predisposition Autosomal dominant; HNF1A, HNF4A, GCK, HNF1B (rare) Positive autoantibodies to islet β cells; glutamic acid decarboxylase antibody is the most predominant.

It often results in diabetic ketoacidosis at diagnosis and requires insulin treatment. The patient in this scenario is 22 years old and has a GCK mutation, which does not align with Type 1 Diabetes. Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (Option B) usually presents in adulthood and is associated with obesity, genetic predisposition, and metabolic syndrome features like hypertension and hyperlipidemia. The patient in this scenario is lean, has weight loss, and genetic testing identifies a GCK mutation, which is more indicative of MODY rather than Type 2 Diabetes. Latent Autoimmune Diabetes of Adults (Option D) is a form of diabetes that occurs in adults and shares features with both Type 1 and Type 2 diabetes. It is characterized by the presence of autoantibodies to islet beta cells, and patients may initially be misdiagnosed as having Type 2 diabetes. However, the patient's absence of autoimmune markers suggest that",

      "explanation": "Correct Answer: B) Hypothalamic hamartoma Explanation: Hypothalamic hamartoma is the most likely diagnosis due to its association with early-onset puberty, gelastic seizures (uncontrolled laughter ), and a mass typically in the hypothalamic region. which aligns with the clinical presentation and MRI findings in this case. Hypothalamic Hamartoma: A benign, non-neoplastic tumour located in the hypothalamus. It is the most common cause of central precocious puberty due to its effect on the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis. Symptoms : Characterized by early-onset and rapid progression of puberty, gelastic seizures (uncontrolled laughter), and other seizure types. Imaging : MRI typically shows a well-defined mass in the hypothalamus. This is the most consistent with the presentation and imaging described. Craniopharyngioma (Option A) is a benign tumour near the pituitary gland that can cause endocrine problems, vision issues, and headaches. It may lead to growth issues and seizures but not early-onset puberty or laughing spells. CT imaging typically shows a cystic mass with calcifications in the suprasellar region.

      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: C) Constitutional obesity Explanation: The child’s obesity is likely due to environmental factors, as he has normal growth for his age, no developmental delay, and no dysmorphic features. The family history of obesity also supports constitutional obesity , which is more common and accounts for 95% of cases. Feature Constitutional (Exogenous) Obesity Pathological (Endogenous) Obesity Cause Imbalance in energy intake and expenditure Endocrine, genetic, hypothalamic, or drug-related causes Aetiology Environmental factors (95% cases) Endocrine: Cushing syndrome, growth hormone deficiency, hypothyroidism, pseudohypoparathyroidism. Hypothalamic: Head injury, infection, brain tumour, radiation, chemotherapy, following neurosurgery, ROHHAD(NET). Drugs: Antiepileptic drugs, steroids, antidepressants, estrogen. Genetic syndromes: Prader-Willi, Bardet-BiedI, Laurence-Moon, Beckwith-Wiedemann, Carpenter syndromes. Monogenic disorders: Leptin deficiency, or resistance (leptin receptor defect), abnormalities of melanocortin-4 receptor and proconvertase. Psychological: Personal or parental stress, binge eating. Growth Normal or tall for age Decelerated linear growth, height below genetic potential Body Fat Distribution Generalized obesity Often central obesity (Cushing syndrome) Appetite Normal or slightly increased May show excessive appetite (e.g., hypothalamic lesions) Family History Often positive for a family history of obesity Family history may suggest genetic syndromes (e.g., Prader-Willi) Developmental Delay/Dysmorphism Absent specific dysmorphic or syndromic features May be present (e.g., genetic syndromes like Bardet-Biedl) Cushing syndrome (Option A) typically presents with central obesity, growth retardation, and features like hirsutism, purple striae, and a buffalo hump. The patient in the scenario has generalized obesity with normal height for age and no signs of Cushingoid features such as striae or hirsutism, which makes this diagnosis less likely. Hypothyroidism (Option B) is associated with weight gain, growth retardation, coarse skin, and characteristic facial features. This patient has normal growth and no other signs of hypothyroidism, making it an unlikely cause of his obesity. Prader-Willi syndrome (Option D) : Unlike Prader-Willi syndrome, this patient has normal development, no history of hypotonia or feeding difficulties in infancy, and no dysmorphic features, making it the less likely diagnosis.

      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: A) Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (T2DM) with associated obesity. Explanation: The child's BMI at the 98th percentile indicates obesity, a major risk factor for T2DM. The symptoms of lethargy, frequent thirst, and increased urination (polydipsia and polyuria) are classic signs of diabetes. Additionally, the dark patches on the neck, known as acanthosis nigricans , are often associated with insulin resistance, a hallmark of T2DM. Obesity Obesity Overweight Adult BMI ≥ 30 BMI between 25 and 30 Children BMI ≥ 95th percentile for age and sex BMI between 85th and 95th percentiles Aetiology: Constitutional causes: Imbalance between caloric intake and energy expenditure. Easy access to energy-dense foods, and large portion sizes. Sedentary lifestyle. High intake of sugary beverages, processed foods, and large portions. Genetic syndromes eg. Prader-Willi syndrome Endocrine causes: Cushing syndrome GH deficiency Hypothyroidism Chronic sleep deprivation can disrupt appetite-regulating hormones, leading to weight gain. Disruption of hormones like leptin and adiponectin. Hypothyroidism with weight gain (Option B): Hypothyroidism can cause weight gain and lethargy, but it is less likely to cause the symptoms of increased thirst and urination. Additionally, acanthosis nigricans is not commonly associated with hypothyroidism. Cystic Fibrosis-related diabetes (CFRD) (Option C) occurs in individuals with cystic fibrosis, which other symptoms, such as recurrent lung infections or gastrointestinal issues would typically accompany. There is no indication of cystic fibrosis in this child's history. Adrenal insufficiency (Option D) can cause symptoms like fatigue and weight loss rather than weight gain. It does not typically cause polyuria, polydipsia, or acanthosis nigricans. Reference: Nelson Textbook of Paediatrics, 21st Edition, Page 346",

      "question": "A 12 y/o girl is undergoing treatment for diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA). After an initial bolus of 0.9% saline, she is started on an insulin infusion at 0.1 U/kg/h after an hour.

        "C": "Add 5% dextrose to the IV fluids",
        "D": "Administer an additional bolus of 0.9% saline"
      },
      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Correct answer: C) Add 5% dextrose to the IV fluids Explanation: As the blood glucose level approaches ≤ 300 mg/dL , adding 5% dextrose to the IV fluids is essential to prevent hypoglycemia while continuing insulin therapy to resolve the underlying ketoacidosis. This helps maintain glucose levels while the acidosis is treated. DKA Management in Children Immediate Management (First Hour): Rapid Assessment: Evaluate the child's vital signs (heart rate, respiratory rate, blood pressure) and weight. Assess GCS and check for signs of dehydration. Obtain blood samples for urgent measurement of blood glucose, blood beta-hydroxybutyrate (BHB) if available, venous pH, electrolytes (including bicarbonate), serum urea nitrogen, and creatinine. Serum BHB concentration : Most precise approach to measuring the severity of DKA Establish IV Access: Place two large-bore peripheral IV lines. Central lines are generally avoided (risk of thrombosis) unless necessary. Initial Fluid Resuscitation Administer a bolus of 0.9% saline at a rate of 10-20 ml/kg over 20-30 minutes to restore circulatory volume and address dehydration. After First Hour Initiate Insulin Therapy Start an intravenous insulin infusion at 0.05-0.1 U/kg/h, typically one hour after initiating fluids. Continue Fluid Therapy After the initial bolus, continue fluid replacement with 0.45% to 0.9% saline, to replace the estimated fluid deficit over 24 to 48 hours. Adjust fluids based on clinical status and laboratory values. Monitoring and Replacing Electrolytes Begin potassium replacement once urine output is confirmed as insulin causes K+ entry into cells leading to hypokalemia. Monitor vital signs, GCS, fluid balance, and capillary blood glucose every hour. Reassess electrolytes, blood glucose, blood urea nitrogen, calcium, magnesium, phosphate, blood gases, and BOHB every two hours if available. Transition Phase (6-24 Hours): Gradual Reduction of IV Fluids and transition to subcutaneous Insulin As DKA resolves and the child can tolerate oral intake, gradually reduce IV fluids while maintaining hydration. Transition to subcutaneous insulin once pH > 7.30, bicarbonate > 18 mmol/L, and BOHB < 1 mmol/L. Administer the first subcutaneous insulin dose 15-30 minutes before discontinuing the IV insulin infusion. Increase the insulin infusion rate (Option A): It is not advisable when the blood glucose level drops, as this could lead to hypoglycemia. The goal of insulin therapy in DKA is to gradually lower blood glucose while resolving ketoacidosis, not to rapidly decrease blood glucose levels. Stop insulin therapy (Option B): Discontinuing insulin therapy too early could result in a rebound worsening of ketoacidosis. Even if blood glucose",

        "D": "Central Precocious Puberty"
      },
      "correct_answer": "D",
      "explanation": "Correct answer: D) Central Precocious Puberty Explanation: Precocious puberty in girls is the development of secondary sexual characteristics before reaching the age of 8. Central precocious puberty is characterized by the premature activation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis, leading to increased gonadotropin levels, such as LH. This condition is more common in girls and typically presents with early development of secondary sexual characteristics, such as breast development, as well as accelerated growth. Central Precocious Puberty (CPP) Peripheral Precocious Puberty (PPP) Cause CPP is due to the early activation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis, leading to the release of gonadotropins (LH and FSH) that stimulate the ovaries to produce estrogen. PPP results from estrogen production independent of the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis. Common Causes The most frequent cause in girls is idiopathic, with no identifiable underlying condition. Central nervous system abnormalities (e.g., hypothalamic hamartoma, glioma, hydrocephalus) are less common. The most common cause in girls is estrogen-producing ovarian cysts, leading to fluctuating pubertal development and early vaginal bleeding. Symptoms Girls with CPP show advanced growth and bone age Girls with PPP may have symptoms related to the specific underlying condition, such as delayed bone age in hypothyroidism or skin pigmentation changes in McCune-Albright syndrome. Diagnostic Tests : Basal LH and FSH levels, a GnRH stimulation test, and imaging (ultrasound, MRI) help differentiate between CPP and PPP. Treatment GnRH analogues can reverse early-onset CPP and help with height if started before age 6. Stop GnRH analogs at age 11 or at bone age 12.5. MPA : Used to delay postpone menstruation in girls with intellectual disability, but doesn’t improve height. Cyproterone : Another option for suppressing puberty. Hypothyroidism and Puberty : Thyroxine replacement can reverse puberty changes caused by hypothyroidism. McCune-Albright Syndrome Treatment : Aromatase Inhibitors : Anastrozole, Letrozole (to reduce estrogen production) Estrogen Receptor Antagonists : Tamoxifen, Fulvestrant (to block estrogen action) Ovarian Cysts : Treatment depends on the size and shape of the cysts. Peripheral Precocious Puberty (Option A): It results from the autonomous production of sex hormones independent of the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis. In PPP, LH levels are typically low or prepubertal because the central axis is not involved in the process. Constitutional delayed puberty (Option B): This condition involves a delayed rather than early onset of puberty. Girls with a constitutional delay of growth and puberty typically have low LH levels and delayed development of secondary sexual characteristics, the opposite of what is observed in this case.

      },
      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: A) Basal-Bolus Regimen Explanation: This regimen provides the most flexibility in terms of meal timing and carbohydrate intake. It involves a long-acting insulin (basal) to cover the body's needs throughout the day and night, and a rapid-acting insulin (bolus) given at mealtimes to manage the rise in blood glucose levels after eating. This allows patients to adjust their insulin doses based on the amount of carbohydrates they consume, offering greater flexibility. Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus (T1DM) Management (Goal- HbA1c < 7.5%) Types of Insulin: Short- Acting Insulin : Lispro, aspart, and glulisine insulin Intermediate-acting insulin : Neutral protamine Hagedorm (NPH) Long-acting insulin : Glargine, detemir, degludec Insulin Therapy: Initiation: At diagnosis for all T1DM patients Starting Dose: 0.4 to 1.2 units/kg/day (based on age, pubertal stage, DKA presence). Monitoring: Frequent glucose checks and dosage adjustments by the diabetes team. There are 2 regimes used for insulin therapy: 1. Basal-Bolus Insulin Regimes: Require multiple daily injections. Basal : Slow-onset, long-duration insulin for between-meal control (once or twice daily) eg. glargine, detemir, degludec. Bolus : Rapid-onset insulin is given with meals for carbohydrate coverage and hyperglycemia correction eg. lispro, aspart, and glulisine insulin. 2. Mixed Split Insulin Regimes: Three daily injections regimen: 1st injection with breakfast : A short-acting insulin + Intermediate-acting insulin 2nd injection with dinne r: A short-acting insulin only. 3rd injection at bedtime : A long-acting insulin only. Twice daily injection Regimen: 1st injection at breakfast: Pre-mixed injection (containing short-acting and intermediate-acting insulin) 2nd injection at dinner : same as 1st. Insulin Pump Therapy: Mechanism: Continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion via battery-powered pumps. Advantages: Closer approximation of normal insulin profiles, flexible meal/snack timing. Transition Timing: 6-12 months post-diagnosis, based on patient preference. Three Daily Injection Regimen (Option B): Typically includes a mixture of short- and intermediate-acting insulins. While it provides good glucose control, it offers less flexibility compared to the basal-bolus regimen because meal timing needs to align with the insulin action peaks. Once-daily injection of long-acting insulin only (Option C): This regimen is the least flexible because it does not account for meals, providing only basal coverage without bolus insulin. Twice-daily injection of short-acting insulin only (Option D): This regimen is also less flexible since it requires strict meal timing to avoid hypoglycemia, with less ability to adjust for variations in carbohydrate intake.",

      "question": "A 16 y/o girl with normal breast development presents with primary amenorrhea. An ultrasound shows an absent uterus and undescended testes. Laboratory results reveal elevated androgen levels, normal estrogen levels, and a 46, XY karyotype. A mutation in the AR gene is confirmed. What is the most likely diagnosis?",

        "D": "Klinefelter Syndrome"
      },
      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: A) Complete Androgen Insensitivity Syndrome Explanation: In Complete Androgen Insensitivity Syndrome (CAIS): Breast development is normal because the body converts androgens to estrogen, allowing for feminization. Primary amenorrhea occurs due to the absence of a uterus and female internal genitalia. Undescended testes are present because the patient is genetically male (46, XY karyotype) but the body is unresponsive to androgens. Elevated androgen levels are typical as the body produces them, but they have little effect due to the androgen receptor mutation. AR gene mutation confirms androgen insensitivity, and in CAIS, there is complete resistance to androgen action, leading to female external genitalia despite a male genotype. Complete Androgen Insensitivity Syndrome (CAIS) Partial Androgen Insensitivity Syndrome (PAIS) Mild Androgen Insensitivity Syndrome (MAIS) Clinical Features Female external appearance with normal breast development. Short vagina Absent uterus and fallopian tubes Undescended testes Primary amenorrhea Infertility. Variable genitalia ranging from predominantly female with clitoromegaly to predominantly male with micropenis. Gynecomastia Bifid scrotum Undescended testes Virilization. Male genitalia with micropenis Gynecomastia, Impaired fertility. Diagnosis Suspected in a phenotypically female individual with a 46, XY karyotype, inguinal hernia with testes, elevated testosterone and LH, normal estradiol, confirmed by AR gene mutation. Suspected with ambiguous genitalia or undervirilization, elevated testosterone, and LH, confirmed by AR gene mutation. Clinical features and AR gene mutation testing. Treatment Gonadectomy to prevent malignancy risk, estrogen replacement, vaginal dilation, and psychological support. Based on undervirilization, fertility potential, and preference, may include gonadectomy, hormone therapy, genital reconstructive surgery, and psychological support. Supportive care, psychological counselling, and fertility evaluation. Partial Androgen Insensitivity Syndrome (Option B): In PAIS, the body has partial responsiveness to androgens, leading to a wide range of phenotypes, from ambiguous genitalia to predominantly male or female external genitalia with varying degrees of virilization. They typically have ambiguous genitalia, not the normal female external genitalia seen in this case. They do not have normal breast development as eitherl. Mild Androgen Insensitivity Syndrome (Option C ): Patients with MAIS usually have normal male genitalia and only minor defects such as infertility or gynecomastia.",

      "question": "A 24-week-old fetus is found to have ambiguous genitalia during a routine ultrasound. Karyotyping reveals a 46, XY chromosomal pattern.

        "D": "Decreased DAX1 Expression"
      },
      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: A) Deficient Expression of SRY Explanation: The SRY (Sex-determining Region Y) gene is crucial for the initiation of testis development. If SRY is not expressed properly, testes may not develop, leading to ambiguous genitalia or underdeveloped male genitalia in a 46, XY fetus. This explanation is consistent with the observed fetal presentation. 1. Gonadal Differentiation : Early Development : Germ cells migrate to the gonadal ridge and form a bipotential gonad. Sexual differentiation starts with the karyotype of the fetus (XX or XY). Testis Formation : The presence of SRY on the Y chromosome leads to testis development. Key genes involved include: WT1 and SF1 : Required for initial gonadal development. SOX9 : Works with SRY to promote testis formation. DAX1 : Can inhibit testis formation if overexpressed. Ovary Formation : In the absence of SRY, the gonad develops into an ovary. 2. Genital Differentiation : In Males : Testis produces the Antimullerian hormone -AMH (from Sertoli cells) and testosterone (from Leydig cells). AMH regresses the Mullerian duct. Testosterone differentiates the wolfian duct into Vas deferens and seminiferous tubules. Testosterone gets converted into Dihydrotestosterone (DHT) which causes male external genitalia development. In Females : Without AMH and testosterone, Müllerian ducts form female reproductive organs (fallopian tubes, uterus, upper vagina). Absence of testosterone leads to undifferentiated external genitalia (labia majora and minora, clitoris, and lower vagina). Effects of Androgens : Prenatal Exposure : May cause labioscrotal fusion in females, leading to ambiguous genitalia. Postnatal Exposure : Typically results in clitoromegaly without labial fusion. Differential Diagnosis of ambiguous genitalia: Transverse testicular ectopia True hermaphrodite Male pseudo hermaphrodite Complete androgen insensitivity syndrome Partial androgen insensitivity syndrome 5 alpha reductase deficiency Persistent Mullerian duct syndrome Mixed gonadal dysgenesis Female pseudo hermaphrodite Congenital adrenal hyperplasia Dysgenetic male pseudo hermaphrodite Pure gonadal dysgenesis Excessive SOX9 Activity (Option B): SOX9 is another gene involved in male sexual development. Increased activity of SOX9 typically promotes male differentiation, not ambiguous genitalia, making it an unlikely explanation in this case. Absent AMH Production(Option C): AMH is produced by the developing testes to prevent the formation of female internal structures (Müllerian ducts). While a lack of AMH could lead to the presence of female internal genitalia, it would",

        "D": "Klinefelter Syndrome"
      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Correct answer: B) Hypogonadotropic Hypogonadism Explanation: Hypogonadotropic hypogonadism is a condition where delayed puberty results from insufficient stimulation of the gonads due to low levels of gonadotropins . This can be caused by central nervous system issues affecting the release of gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH). Factors contributing to this condition include stress, chronic illness, malnutrition, or congenital abnormalities affecting the hypothalamus. The boy’s low LH and FSH levels align with this diagnosis. Causes of delayed puberty: DELAYED PUBERTY Hypergonadotropic Hypogonadism In Girls In Boys Gonadal dysgenesis: Turner syndrome, 46, XY with SRY deletion, trisomy 18, 13, 21. Steroidogenic defects: StAR, 17 α -hydroxylase, 17 β -hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase, or aromatase deficiency. Ovarian insults: Surgery, radiation, alkylating agents, infections. Autoimmune ovarian failure: Autoimmune polyendocrinopathy Gonadotropin resistance: LH and FSH receptor mutations. Chromosomal abnormalities: Klinefelter syndrome, gonadal dysgenesis Steroidogenic defects: StAR, 17 α -hydroxylase, 17 β -hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase deficiency, Smith-Lemli-Opitz syndrome Testicular insults: Radiotherapy, chemotherapy, trauma, torsion, infections Malformations: Vanishing testis syndrome, cryptorchidism Inefficient testosterone action: 5 α -reductase deficiency. Resistance to testosterone action: Androgen insensitivity syndrome. Isolated Amenorrhea in Girls Structural malformations: Müllerian agenesis, vaginal septum, imperforate hymen. Inefficient androgen action: 46, XY with complete androgen insensitivity syndrome. DELAYED PUBERTY Hypogonadotropic Hypogonadism Transient Causes Permanent Causes Self-limited delayed puberty (constitutional delay): Most common in boys, less frequent in girls Systemic disorders: Renal failure, liver disease, celiac disease, renal tubular acidosis, cystic fibrosis Nutritional disorders: Malnutrition, anorexia nervosa Endocrine disorders: Hypothyroidism, hyperprolactinemia, type 1 diabetes Isolated hypogonadotropic hypogonadism Genetic mutations: KAL1, GnRH receptor, LH, FSH, CHD7, DAX1 gene. Dysmorphic syndromes: Prader-Willi, Laurence-Moon, Bardet-Biedl Multiple pituitary hormone deficiencies Malformations: Holoprosencephaly, septo-optic dysplasia, midline defects Genetic disorders: PROP1, LH gene deletions Brain tumours: Craniopharyngioma, germinoma, glioma Brain injury: Surgery, infection, radiation, trauma Infiltrative disorders: Histiocytosis, autoimmune disorders Constitutional Delay (Option A): This is characterized by a normal hormonal profile and is often a variation in the",

      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "Correct answer: A) Central precocious puberty Explanation: Precocious puberty is when puberty begins before 9.5 years of age in boys. In this scenario, elevated LH levels and increased testicular volume strongly indicate central precocious puberty, where the body’s normal pubertal mechanisms are activated prematurely. Organic neurological cases are more common in boys which include hypothalamic hamartoma, glioma, hydrocephalus, and tubercular meningitis. Peripheral precocious puberty due to congenital adrenal hyperplasia (Option B): It results from the autonomous production of sex hormones without the involvement of the central axis. CAH leads to the overproduction of androgens, presenting with signs of puberty and advanced bone age. However, elevated LH levels suggest a central rather than peripheral cause. Peripheral precocious puberty due to an hCG-secreting tumour (Option C): hCG-secreting tumours, such as those found in the liver or brain, can stimulate testicular production of testosterone without involving the hypothalamic-pituitary axis. These tumours do not have elevated LH. Peripheral precocious puberty due to an androgen-secreting testicular tumour (Option D): This condition involves a tumour within the testes that produces androgens independent of central hormonal control. It presents with signs of early puberty, such as unilateral testicular enlargement, and typically maintains prepubertal LH levels.
