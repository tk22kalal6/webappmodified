        "D": "Cast"
      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: B) Immobilisation and above the elbow plaster slab (90 degree flexion) occur just above the elbow joint and can result in pain, swelling, and deformity of the affected arm. The initial evaluation typically involves an X-ray of the elbow to assess the fracture. In this case, if the X-ray of the right elbow is not significant(undisplaced). Therefore, the next best step would be Immobilisation and above the elbow plaster slab(90 degree flexion). Supracondylar fractures: Mechanism of injury: Supracondylar fractures typically occur due to a fall onto an outstretched hand with an extended arm, causing a significant force to be transmitted to the distal humerus. Common in children: Supracondylar fractures are more common in children, particularly between the ages of 5 and 7 years. Presentation : Patients with a supracondylar fracture often present with pain, swelling, and deformity in the elbow region. There may also be limited range of motion and tenderness upon palpation. Types : Supracondylar fractures can be classified into different types based on the degree of displacement and the involvement of surrounding structures. The most commonly used classification system is the Gartland classification , which includes three types: Type I: Non-displaced or minimally displaced fracture. Type II: Fracture with significant displacement but with intact posterior cortex. Type III: Fracture with complete displacement and loss of alignment. Reference: SCH",

      "question": "What type of displacement is most likely observed in a 60-year-old female patient who presents with pain and swelling in her left wrist after falling on an outstretched hand, and exhibits a dinner fork deformity upon examination?",
      "options": {
        "A": "Proximal and ventral displacement of radius",
        "B": "Supination and dorsal displacement of radius",
        "C": "Proximal and dorsal displacement of ulna",
        "D": "Proximal and ventral displacement of ulna"
      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "the distal fragment of the radius is displaced dorsally. At the same time, the wrist is tilted towards the palm of the hand, resulting in the characteristic dinner fork deformity.. Displacement of Radius that may be seen in Colles’ fracture: Dorsal shift Dorsal tilt Lateral shift Lateral tilt Supination Proximal shift Diagnosis is done by X-ray. The most common is Dorsal tilt. Best test to identify colles fracture - styloid process test. Styloid Process Test: Normally the radial styloid process is distal to the ulnar styloid process. In Colles fracture - both radial and ulnar styloid processes are at the same level. Most reliable clinical sign. Management of a Colles' fracture: Closed reduction and below elbow POP cast- “Handshake cast” : Palmar flexion,pronation and ulnar deviation (prevent dorsal displacement). Complications Stiffness of fingers - most common Malunion - next common complication Median nerve - most common nerve injured. One of the very common causes of Carpal tunnel syndrome. Extensor pollicis longus - most common tendon injured. Proximal and ventral displacement of radius (Option A) is reverse colle’s fracture, this would result in a deformity that appears opposite to the dinner fork deformity, with the wrist being angled downwards. Proximal and dorsal displacement of ulna (Option C) distal radius fracture would not typically result in displacement of the ulna. Proximal and ventral displacement of ulna (Option D) is also incorrect as this would result in a deformity that appears opposite to the dinner fork deformity, with the wrist angled upwards.",

      "question": "Which nerve is most likely to be damaged in cases of anterior shoulder dislocation?",

        "C": "Radial nerve",
        "D": "Suprascapular nerve"
      },
      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: A) Axillary nerve Explanation: Anterior dislocation of the shoulder can result in damage to the axillary nerve. The axillary nerve is a nerve that arises from the brachial plexus and runs along the surgical neck of the humerus. It innervates the deltoid muscle and the teres minor muscle, as well as provides sensory innervation to the skin over the lateral aspect of the shoulder. When the shoulder is dislocated anteriorly, the head of the humerus moves forward and can compress or stretch the axillary nerve, resulting in damage to the nerve. This can cause weakness or paralysis of the deltoid muscle and sensory loss over the lateral aspect of the shoulder. The severity of the axillary nerve injury depends on the degree of stretching or compression that occurs during the dislocation. Median nerve (Option B): is most commonly injured in the posterior dislocation of the elbow. It innervates the muscles of the forearm and provides sensory innervation to the skin of the hand. Anterior dislocation of the shoulder is unlikely to directly affect the median nerve. Radial and suprascapular nerves (Options C and D): are unlikely to be damaged in anterior shoulder dislocation.

      },
      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: A) Durkan's test Explanation: Carpal Compression Test or Median Compression Test or Durkan’s test is a diagnostic test of carpal tunnel syndrome. It involves applying direct pressure over the carpal tunnel for 30 seconds . If the patient experiences numbness, pain, or paresthesia in the distribution of the median nerve, the test is considered positive. Carpal tunnel syndrome Definition Compression of the median nerve as it passes through the carpal tunnel in the wrist Symptoms Numbness, tingling in thumb, index, and middle fingers Pain in hand and wrist Weakness in grip Symptoms often worse at night and improve during the day. Advanced cases may lead to constant symptoms, hand weakness, clumsiness, and muscle atrophy. Structures Affected Median Nerve : Compressed within the carpal tunnel, leading to symptoms and signs. Flexor Tendons : The nine flexor tendons passing through the carpal tunnel can become inflamed, further compressing the median nerve. Structures Spared Thenar Eminence : Sensory loss generally spares this area because its nerve (palmar sensory cutaneous nerve) bypasses the carpal tunnel. Clinical Signs Weakness: Notable weakness in thumb abduction and opposition. Atrophy : Possible atrophy of the thenar eminence in advanced cases. Sensory Loss : Loss typically affects the median nerve distribution (thumb, index, middle, and radial half of the fourth digit). Causes Idiopathic- commonest cause Inflammatory causes- Rheumatoid arthritis, wrist osteoarthritis Post-traumatic causes- Bone thickening after a Colles' fracture Endocrine causes- Myxoedema, Acromegaly Diagnostic Tests Nerve Conduction Studies (NCS) - primary diagnostic test Electromyography (EMG) Carpal Compression Test/ Durkan test : Diagnostic test. Positive if pain/paresthesias occur during pressure application over the carpal tunnel. Phalen Test : Positive if pain/paresthesias arise during wrist flexion. (Option B ruled out) Tinel Test: Positive if tapping over the carpal tunnel elicits symptoms. (Option C ruled out) Treatment Conservative: Wrist splinting, NSAIDs, activity modification Corticosteroid injections Surgical: Carpal tunnel release (for severe or refractory cases) Two-point discrimination (Option D) : This test assesses sensory function, specifically the ability to distinguish between two separate points of stimulation. While a loss of two-point discrimination can be a sign of carpal tunnel syndrome, this test is more general for sensory assessment and not as specific for diagnosing carpal tunnel syndrome as Durkan's test.

Subclavicular : The humeral head is displaced beneath the clavicle. Intrathoracic : The humeral head dislocates into the thoracic cavity, which is rare. Subcoracoid : The humeral head lies below the coracoid process. Clinical findings Loss of the deltoid contour (loss of shoulder roundness) The shoulder is extended, abducted and externally rotated . Clinical tests Duga’s test is the inability to touch the opposite shoulder. Hamilton ruler test is where the gap between the ruler and the arm is lost. Callaway’s test is increased girth of the axilla on the dislocated side. Bryant’s Test is where the anterior axillary fold is displaced downward on the affected side. Regiment batch sign is loss of sensation due to axillary nerve damage. Imaging X-ray reveals that the humeral head is displaced anteriorly and inferiorly, often under the coracoid process (\"subcoracoid\" position) An MRI is necessary to assess soft-tissue injuries and identify Bankart and Hill-Sachs lesions, which are complications of shoulder dislocations and increase the risk of recurrence due to joint instability.

      "explanation": "Correct Answer: A) Elbow Fracture Explanation: The three-point bony relationship refers to the alignment of three specific landmarks in the elbow joint: the capitellum, the radial head, and the olecranon process. When these three points are aligned properly, it indicates that the elbow joint is in its normal anatomical position. In the context of elbow fractures, assessing the three-point bony relationship is crucial in determining the presence of a fracture and evaluating its displacement or dislocation. Any disruption in the alignment of these three points may indicate a fracture or joint injury. Elbow Fractures: Treatment options for elbow fractures depend on various factors, including the type and severity of the fracture, patient age, and overall health. Treatment may involve: Nonsurgical Treatment: Some fractures can be managed with immobilization, such as casting or splinting, followed by a period of rest and rehabilitation. Surgical Treatment: Certain fractures may require surgical intervention, such as open reduction (realignment of the fractured bones) and internal fixation (use of screws, plates, or rods to hold the bones in place). Rehabilitation : After treatment, rehabilitation plays a crucial role in the recovery process. Physical therapy and exercises help restore strength, range of motion, and function to the elbow joint.

        "D": "Tavernier's manoeuvre is used for closed reduction"
      },
      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "Perilunate dislocation involves the disruption of the normal alignment between the carpal bones in the wrist. In perilunate dislocation, the lunate bone remains in its anatomical position, while the other carpal bones, including the scaphoid, triquetrum, and other adjacent bones, dislocate dorsally Therefore, the statement that the lunate is dislocated anteriorly while the rest of the carpals remain in position is incorrect. Incorrect Options: Option B - Lunate remains in position but rest other dislocate dorsally - In perilunate dislocation, the lunate bone remains in its anatomical position, while the other carpal bones, including the scaphoid, triquetrum, and other adjacent bones, dislocate dorsally. This displacement can result from high-energy trauma or significant wrist hyperextension. Option C - Involves median nerve injury- Perilunate dislocation can cause compression or injury to the median nerve. The median nerve runs through the carpal tunnel, which can be affected by the dislocation and subsequent displacement of the carpal bones. Median nerve injury can lead to symptoms such as numbness, tingling, or weakness in the hand and fingers. Option D - Tavernier's manoeuvre is used for closed reduction- Tavernier's maneuver, or closed reduction, is a technique used to reposition the dislocated carpal bones in perilunate dislocation. It involves applying traction and manipulation to guide the displaced carpal bones back into their proper alignment. This maneuver is commonly employed to reduce the dislocation before further stabilization or surgical intervention. Reference: Prepladder Notes",

Allen's test: The examiner compresses both arteries at the wrist while the patient clenches their fist to drain blood from the hand. Subsequently, pressure on one artery is released, and the return of hand colour is observed. A rapid colour return indicates an adequate blood supply from that artery. It ensures an adequate collateral circulation and is especially useful before procedures such as arterial blood gas sampling or harvesting the radial artery for grafting. Incorrect Options: Adson test (Option B): Adson's test is a provocative test for Thoracic Outlet Syndrome accompanied by compression of the subclavian artery by a cervical rib or tightened anterior and middle scalene muscles.

Classification Type I: AC ligament sprain; joint remains undisplaced. Type II: AC ligaments torn; joint subluxated with slight clavicle elevation. Type III: AC and coracoclavicular ligaments torn ; joint dislocated, visible step deformity. (Option C) Type IV: Posterior clavicle displacement. Type V: Marked upward clavicle displacement. Type VI: Inferior clavicle displacement beneath the coracoid. Clinical Features Signs: Pain, bruising, and tenderness at the injury site. Visible ‘step’ in cases of dislocation. Movement: Limited shoulder movement with severe pain in dislocation. X-ray Views: Anteroposterior, cephalic tilt, and axillary views are recommended. Stress view may differentiate Type II vs Type III. Stress View: Measure the distance between the coracoid and clavicle; >50% difference indicates dislocation. Treatment Sprains/Subluxations: Rest in a sling, pain subsides within a week, followed by shoulder exercises. Dislocations: Techniques include ligament reconstruction or clavicle excision. Post-surgery Rehab: Elbow/forearm exercises day after surgery, shoulder movements 2 weeks later. Avoid strenuous lifting for 4–6 months.",

To count ribs: Start counting from the costo-vertebral junction. Locate the first rib and trace its outline from posterior to anterior aspect. Immediately below it you will find the second rib. Similarly you can count the rest of the ribs on the radiograph. Most rib fractures can be diagnosed as discontinuity in the outline of the rib on the radiograph. Some rib fractures (especially those of the lateral part of the ribs) may not be visible on a PA view and may need an oblique view. In doubtful cases, a CT Chest may resolve the query. In clinical practice, rib fractures are diagnosed using clinical and radiological findings.",

      "explanation": "Correct Answer: B) Sciatic nerve Explanation: Positive trendelenburg gait indicates ipsilateral Superior gluteal nerve palsy, which supplies Hip abductors i.e. Gluetus medius and gluteus minimus. The superior gluteal nerve is a direct branch of the sacral plexus and is not related to the sciatic nerve. Trendelenberg sign: When the body's weight is balanced on one leg, the gluteal muscles on the supported side help elevate the opposite, unsupported side of the pelvis. However, if there is a malfunction in the abductor mechanism, the Sound side sinks , which is referred to as a positive Trendelenburg sign (uncompensated). This sign indicates issues with hip abductors, such as paralysis of the gluteus medius and minimus ; problems with the fulcrum, including congenital or pathological hip dislocations; and concerns related to body weight, such as an unhealed fracture of the femoral neck. When patients with the gluteus medius and minimus paralysis walk, they have a characteristic lurching gait ie, during the single leg supporting phase of walking, there is leaning of the trunk to the affected side known as the compensated Trendelenburg sign . Duck waddling gait is seen when both the sides are affected. Reference: Apley and Solomon’s System of Orthopaedics and Trauma, 10th Edition, Page 548",

These fractures can result in a characteristic deformity known as \"Gartland Type III\" or \"posteromedial angulation\" deformity. The deformity in a supracondylar fracture typically presents with the following features: Angulation: There is an abnormal bending or angulation of the forearm in relation to the upper arm.

      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "→ Wheal without surrounding flare → Wheal without surrounding flare: Central capillary dilation → Wheal without surrounding flare: In certain conditions where there is an impairment in the axon reflex or sympathetic vasoconstrictor response, such as in some neurological disorders or nerve injurie s, the surrounding flare component may be absent. In such cases, the individual may still exhibit central capillary dilation and the formation of a wheal, but the surrounding redness and warmth seen in a normal response will not be present. Incorrect Options: Option A - Central capillary dilation → Wheal → Surrounding flare: This sequence describes the typical response observed in a normal individual during the histamine test . Histamine, when applied to the skin, causes central capillary dilation, leading to increased blood flow in the area. This is followed by the formation of a wheal, which is a localized swelling due to fluid extravasation caused by increased vascular permeability. Finally, there is a surrounding flare, which refers to the extension of redness and warmth beyond the immediate area of the wheel. The surrounding flare is a result of the axon reflex, which involves the release of neuropeptides and the dilation of blood vessels mediated by the sympathetic nervous system. Option C - Central capillary dilation → Wheal with exaggerated surrounding flare: This option suggests an exaggerated response to histamine, where there is an excessive surrounding flare in addition to central capillary dilation and wheal formation. This exaggerated response may be observed in certain conditions characterized by increased vascular reactivity, such as urticaria or allergic reactions. Option D - Absent Triple Response: The Triple Response refers to the sequence of central capillary dilation, wheal formation, and surrounding flare observed in a normal response to the histamine test. If all three components of the Triple Response are absent or not observed, it indicates an abnormal or impaired response, which could be indicative of certain pathological conditions or neurological abnormalities .

      "explanation": "typically between 60 and 120 degrees of shoulder abduction. between 60 and 120 degrees of shoulder abduction: Painful arc syndrome, also known as \"subacromial impingement,\" is characterized by pain during a specific range of motion, usually between 60 and 120 degrees of shoulder abduction. This condition often occurs due to compression or impingement of structures in the subacromial space, such as the rotator cuff tendons, as the arm is raised. Incorrect Options: Option A - A condition in which joint stiffness lasts for more than 30 minutes in the morning, affecting multiple joints: This option does not accurately describe \"painful arc syndrome.\" Joint stiffness in the morning for more than 30 minutes is typically associated with conditions like rheumatoid arthritis, not painful arc syndrome. Option B - A condition characterized by localized, sharp pain at the site of an injury or inflammation: This option describes localized pain at the site of an injury or inflammation, which can be associated with various musculoskeletal or traumatic conditions but is not specific to painful arc syndrome. Option D - A condition marked by generalized musculoskeletal pain, fatigue, and tender points in various areas of the body: This option describes fibromyalgia, a condition characterized by generalized musculoskeletal pain, fatigue, and tender points in various areas of the body. It is a different condition unrelated to painful arc syndrome. Reference: Prepladder Notes",

      "explanation": "proximal portion (near the base) of the scaphoid are notorious for their high risk of non-union. Non-union refers to the failure of a fracture to heal properly, resulting in persistent pain, limited function, and potential complications. The blood supply to the proximal scaphoid is relatively poor, making it susceptible to delayed or inadequate healing. Incorrect Options: Option B - Inter-Trochanteric: Inter-trochanteric fractures refer to fractures of the femur in the region between the greater and lesser trochanters. These fractures generally have a better healing potential compared to proximal scaphoid fractures. Option C - Distal Radius: Distal radius fractures are common fractures of the forearm near the wrist. While they can be challenging, with appropriate treatment, they usually have a good prognosis and a lower risk of non-union compared to proximal scaphoid fractures. Option D - Talar Neck: Talar neck fractures involve the neck of the talus bone in the foot. These fractures can be complex and have various degrees of blood supply compromise. While they carry a risk of complications, including non-union, the proximal scaphoid fracture is generally considered to be at a higher risk of non-union. Reference: Prepladder Notes",

This is usually seen in adults. It results from a direct injury, as in a fall onto the point of the elbow. Pathoanatomy - The proximal fragment may be pulled proximally by the attached triceps muscle, thus creating a gap at the fracture site. The fracture may be one of the three types. Type I : Crack without displacement of fragments. Type II : Clean break with separation of fragments. Type III: Comminuted fracture. Treatment: It depends upon the type of fracture: Type I: A crack without displacement is treated by immobilising the elbow in an above-elbow plaster slab in 30 degree of flexion After 3 weeks the plaster is removed and elbow exercises begun. Type II: A clean break with separation of the fragments is treated by open reduction and internal fixation using technique of/tension-band wiring is not possible to keep the fragments together in the plaster alone because of the constant pull exerted by the triceps. Type III: A comminuted fracture, if not separated, is treated in a plaster: slab as in type-1, but if the fragments are separated/tension-band wiring",

      "explanation": "specific landmarks in the elbow joint: the capitellum , the radial head , and the olecranon process. When these three points are aligned properly, it indicates that the elbow joint is in its normal anatomical position. In the context of elbow fractures, assessing the three-point bony relationship is crucial in determining the presence of a fracture and evaluating its displacement or dislocation. Any disruption in the alignment of these three points may indicate a fracture or joint injury. Incorrect Options: Option B - Monteggia Fracture: A Monteggia fracture is a specific type of forearm fracture-dislocation that involves a fracture of the ulna shaft and dislocation of the radial head. While it affects the elbow joint, the diagnostic evaluation of a Monteggia fracture is typically based on the fracture pattern and the dislocation of the radial head, rather than the three-point bony relationship. Option C - Galeazzi Fracture: A Galeazzi fracture is another forearm fracture that involves a fracture of the radius shaft with associated dislocation or subluxation of the distal radioulnar joint (DRUJ). Similar to the Monteggia fracture, the diagnostic evaluation of a Galeazzi fracture focuses on the fracture pattern and the DRUJ dislocation, rather than the three-point bony relationship. Option D - Colles' Fracture: Colles' fracture is a type of distal radius fracture characterized by a fracture of the distal end of the radius, typically resulting from a fall onto an outstretched hand. The diagnosis of Colles' fracture is primarily based on the clinical presentation, physical examination findings, and radiographic evaluation, such as X-rays. The three-point bony relationship is not specifically utilized for diagnosing Colles' fracture. Reference: Prepladder Notes",

Incorrect Options: Option A - Comparing with X-ray of the left hand: Comparing the X-ray of the right hand with the X-ray of the left hand may be helpful in certain situations to assess for any asymmetry or differences in bone structure. However, in the case of a suspected supracondylar fracture, comparing with the X-ray of the left hand alone may not provide sufficient information to confirm or manage the fracture.

      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "knowing the bony lesion: This statement is incorrect. While CT scans can provide detailed information about bony lesions in the shoulder, they are not typically the first-line imaging modality used for diagnosing anterior shoulder dislocation. The primary method for diagnosing shoulder dislocation is a combination of clinical evaluation, physical examination, and X-ray imaging. Incorrect Options: Option A - Recurrent rate is maximum if the patients age less than 20 years: This statement is correct. Anterior shoulder dislocation has a higher recurrence rate in patients younger than 20 years of age. This is due to the increased laxity of the joint structures and the higher likelihood of engaging in activities that can cause shoulder instability. Option B - Axillary nerve is most commonly injured: This statement is correct. The axillary nerve, which innervates the deltoid muscle and the skin over the shoulder, is commonly injured in anterior shoulder dislocations. The nerve can be stretched, compressed, or damaged during the dislocation, leading to temporary or permanent weakness or sensory loss. Option D - Anterior shoulder dislocation is the most common type of shoulder dislocation: This statement is correct. Anterior shoulder dislocation is indeed the most common type of shoulder dislocation, accounting for the majority of all shoulder dislocations. Reference: Prepladder Notes",
