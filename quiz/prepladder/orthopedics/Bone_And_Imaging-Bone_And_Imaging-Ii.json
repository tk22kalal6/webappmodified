However, it does not offer the detailed visualization necessary for specific patellar evaluation. Skyline Merchant View (Option A): Superior-inferior projection of the patella. Indications: Patellar fracture Patellar subluxation Patellofemoral joint disease Patient position: The patient is supine on the table with both knees flexed at roughly 45°. Sunrise View (Option B): Here, the patella appears to be rising over the horizon. The radiograph is taken with the X-ray beam tangential to the patella parallel to the long axis of the lower extremity. Indication: Knee osteoarthritis (OA) Patellar fracture Patellar subluxation Patient Position: The patient is prone, with the knee flexed 115p with a central beam directed toward the patella with approximately 15p cephalad angulation. Horizontal Beam Lateral View (Option D) is particularly useful for evaluating patellar fractures because it allows visualization of the knee joint while minimizing patient movement. This view can reveal the presence of joint effusion and fat pad displacement, which may indicate an underlying patellar fracture or associated knee pathology.",

        "D": "MRI provides more specific metabolic information than nuclear scans."
      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Correct answer: B) MRI does not use ionising radiation, making it safer during pregnancy. harmful to the developing fetus. This makes it a safer option compared to CT scans or nuclear imaging, which use radiation. MRI in bone tumors MRI is more accurate for tumor measurements, radiation planning, and resection planning, particularly when using contrast. Advantages : Provides high spatial resolution images and excellent tissue discrimination across multiple planes. Features useful for lesion characterization include: Precise anatomical location and extent of the lesion. Extent of perilesional edema i n both bone marrow and soft tissue. Degree of extraosseous extension and involvement of neurovascular structures and joints. Signal characteristics that help identify specific tissue components within lesions. MRI is the preferred investigation for suspected spinal cord compression due to pathological vertebral body fractures . MRI does not use ionizing radiation, and it is ideal for detecting bone metastases in pregnant women . (Option B) Dynamic Contrast Enhancement : Gadolinium-enhanced MRI distinguishes between solid and necrotic/cystic components in lesions. Dynamic contrast enhancement can differentiate higher-grade lesions , which enhance more rapidly, from lower-grade ones. Whole-Body MRI : Sometimes used for staging bone tumors , especially in children (e.g., Ewing sarcoma ). Involves acquiring wide-field images using sensitive sequences (e.g., STIR, DIXON, diffusion-weighted imaging) to detect metastatic lesions from head to toe . Valuable for identifying small intramedullary bone metastases that may not be visible on CT and nuclear imaging, avoiding ionizing radiation. Detailed assessment of bone metastases is an advantage, but the key reason for choosing MRI is safety, not detail (Option C). CT is typically faster, but the priority in pregnancy is avoiding radiation, not speed (Option A). Nuclear scans offer better metabolic information, but MRI is selected for its safety profile in this scenario (Option D).

        "D": "Suggests acute inflammatory changes"
      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "cavity Correct answer: B) Represents the reactive hypervascular granulation tissue surrounding a necrotic cavity Explanation: The given image shows the Penumbra sign. It indicates the presence of a central abscess filled with pus surrounded by a thin rim of enhanced hypervascular granulation tissue. On MRI, the abscess appears to have a low signal intensity on T1-weighted images and a high signal intensity on T2-weighted and STIR images, with enhancement after contrast administration. This sign is specific for intraosseous or subperiosteal abscesses in chronic osteomyelitis. Acute osteomyelitis MRI can reveal early signs of acute osteomyelitis, such as bone marrow edema, within 1-2 days of infection onset In acute osteomyelitis, the typical high signal intensity of fatty bone marrow on T1-weighted MRI images decreases , reflecting congestion from fluid and pus. In contrast, fluid-sensitive sequences and post-contrast images display high signal intensity , indicating the presence of edema and inflammation . Chronic osteomyelitis MRI findings in chronic osteomyelitis can reveal: Abscesses and sinus tracts. Sequestra (Necrotic bone fragments appear as low signal intensity areas on T1, T2, and STIR sequences and do not show enhancement.) Thickened periosteum and cloacae. Granulation tissue , soft tissue inflammation & sinus tracks exhibit T1 hypointensity, T2 and STIR hyperintensity, and enhancement after contrast administration. Penumbra sign : It indicates low signal intensity in intraosseous and subperiosteal abscesses, with high signal intensity in surrounding fluid-sensitive sequences. It features a thin enhancing rim of hypervascular granulation tissue around a central low-intensity pus-filled cavity. (Option B) Cloacae are drainage channels for pus but are not represented by the penumbra sign, which specifically highlights granulation tissue around an abscess. (Option A) The penumbra sign is not indicative of tumors, which have different imaging characteristics. It specifically relates to abscess formation in chronic infections. (Option C) The penumbra sign is associated with chronic osteomyelitis, not acute inflammation. (Option D)",

      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Correct answer: B) MRI Explanation: In the given scenario, the presence of weakness in abduction and external rotation suggests a rotator cuff injury. MRI is the gold standard investigation for rotator cuff injuries and reveals any discontinuity in the supraspinatus tendon , which is indicative of a tear. MRI shoulder (rotator cuff injuries) A rotational cuff tear refers to a disruption of tendon fibers. Most often occurs in the supraspinatus tendon , near its insertion or 8 to 15 mm above the greater tuberosity (referred to as the critical zone ). Normal Image of rotator cuff Partial Thickness Tear Appears as a focal area of fiber discontinuity filled with fluid signal on T2W images. (Option D) Fat-suppressed sequences enhance the visibility of the fluid-filled tendon defect. Surface fraying and changes in tendon caliber. Full Thickness Tear Appears as a focal discontinuity in the tendon , extending from the articular to the bursal surface. (Option C) Seen as fluid signal intensity on T2-weighted (T2W) images. Fluid may be present in the subacromial-subdeltoid (SASD) bursa and joint space. Secondary signs include tendon retraction , superior translation of the humeral head , and muscle atrophy , can be seen. Ultrasound (Option A) is a very good modality for the evaluation of the rotator cuff but has limitations due to the skill needed for getting appropriate images and the difficulty in differentiating chronic tears and tendinopathies. CT (Option C) has a limited role in the evaluation of rotator cuff injuries and is used to detect muscle atrophy and fatty degeneration. X-ray (Option D) is the first modality of evaluation and shows humeral migration to determine a diagnosis between acute and chronic tears but will not show the exact injury of the rotator cuff.",

      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: A) Horizontal meniscal tear with parameniscal cyst Explanation: Horizontal meniscal tears are common in degenerative conditions and often seen in patients over 40 years old, typically running parallel to the tibial plateau. In this case, the MRI shows a horizontal tear in the posterior horn of the medial Q meniscus , a common site for such tears. The fluid collection adjacent to the tear is a hallmark of a parameniscal cyst , often associated with complete horizontal tears, due to communication with joint fluid. The menisci are fibrocartilaginous , crescent-shaped structures between the femoral condyles and tibial plateaus. They stabilize the knee by absorbing shock and distributing the load. On MRI , the menisci appear as hypointense structures (dark) across all sequences. On sagittal images : \"Bow-tie\" shape peripherally or opposing triangles centrally. On coronal images : Triangular or wedge-shaped The anterior and posterior horns of the lateral meniscus are typically of equal size . In contrast, on the medial side , the posterior horn of the medial meniscus is larger than the anterior horn . Meniscal cysts are caused by encysted synovial fluid , often as a result of a meniscal tear . If these cysts extend beyond the meniscus’s margins, they are referred to as parameniscal cysts . Meniscal tears are classified as horizontal , longitudinal vertical , or radial based on tear direction. Common causes include trauma",

      "question": "A 65-year-old man presents with progressive back pain, weight loss, and leg weakness. There is tenderness over the thoracic spine, raising suspicion of a spinal tumor. What is the investigation of choice to evaluate for a spinal tumor?",
      "options": {
        "A": "X-ray of the thoracic spine",
        "B": "CT scan of the thoracic spine",
        "C": "MRI of the thoracic spine",
        "D": "PET scan"
      },
      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: C) MRI of the thoracic spine Explanation: MRI is the investigation of choice for spinal tumors because it provides excellent delineation of vertebral body marrow, allowing detection of both primary and metastatic disease. MRI Spine is the investigation of choice in: Intervertebral Disc Diseases: Bulge: symmetric disc extension beyond the interspace most commonly seen in lumbar spine > cervical spine. Protrusion: Asymmetric disc extension beyond the interspace. Extrusion: Extreme disc extension beyond the interspace. Sequestration: A fully separated disc fragment. Postoperative Back Pain: Detecting residual disc material. Identifying epidural hematomas or abscesses. Diagnosing postoperative discitis. Spinal Tumors: Excellent delineation of vertebral body marrow allows detection of both primary and metastatic disease with high sensitivity T1-weighted sequence. Spinal Trauma: Spinal cord injury Epidural hematomas Traumatic disc herniation Detecting soft tissue injuries (e.g., ligamentous tears) in the acute stage. X-ray of the thoracic spine (Option A): Limited to assessing bony structures and cannot evaluate soft tissue or marrow changes. CT scan of the thoracic spine (Option B): While good for bony lesions, it lacks the soft tissue detail necessary to identify tumors and their effects on surrounding structures. PET scan (Option D): Useful for metabolic activity and staging but does not provide detailed anatomical information about the spine and tumors.",

      "question": "A 28-year-old male presents to the hospital after sustaining multiple fractures in a motorcycle accident. Within 36 hours of the trauma, he develops tachycardia, fever, confusion, and a PaO I of 55 mm Hg. A chest X-ray is taken and is shown below. He has petechial rashes noted on his conjunctiva and neck, and his platelet count is 120,000/mm³. What is the most likely diagnosis?",
      "options": {
        "A": "Pulmonary edema",
        "B": "Aspiration pneumonia",
        "C": "Acute respiratory distress syndrome",
        "D": "Transfusion-related acute lung injury"
      },
      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: C) Acute respiratory distress syndrome Explanation: The presence of tachycardia, fever, confusion, low PaO I , petechial rashes, and thrombocytopenia, along with the characteristic \"snowstorm\" appearance on the chest X-ray, indicates Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) , commonly associated with fat embolism after multiple fractures. Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS)/Fat Embolism Defined as post-traumatic distress syndrome occurring within 72 hours of skeletal trauma. Typically manifests within 24-48 hours but can be delayed. Dreaded complication, often associated with multiple fractures , major bone fractures, pelvic fractures, and multisystem injuries (chest, abdomen, head injuries). Affects 10-45% of multiple fracture cases with 11% mortality. Etiology Young adults (20-30 years): Long bone fractures Elderly: Pelvic fractures Iatrogenic cause: Occurs after reamed intramedullary (IM) nailing of the femur. Sources of Fat It can be from 2 sources: Mechanical theory: Fat from bone marrow (most accepted). Biochemical theories: Obstructive theory: Agglutination of chylomicrons in plasma acts as emboli (less accepted). Toxic theory: Free fatty acids destroy",

      "explanation": "Correct Answer: D) Fibrodysplasia ossificans progressiva Explanation: The child’s foot deformities, including symmetrical first-toe malformations seen on X-ray, episodes of painful swelling in the shoulders and neck, and difficulty in movement indicate Fibrodysplasia ossificans progressiva (FOH). Myositis (Fibrodysplasia) ossificans progressiva: Extremely rare genetic connective tissue disorder affecting all the skeletal muscles. Characterized by heterotopic ossification. Affects ligaments, tendons, and skeletal muscles, leading to joint immobility. Age Group: typically appears in early childhood, often before age 6, and progresses throughout life. Causes : Most cases are sporadic, autosomal dominant patterns. Caused by a change in the ACVR1 gene in the bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) signaling pathway. Clinical Features: Skeletal Malformations: Most common:",
