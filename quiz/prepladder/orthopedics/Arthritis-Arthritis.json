      "question": "Which of the following is a common joint pathology associated with the advanced stages of rheumatoid arthritis?",
      "options": {
        "A": "Osteophyte formation",
        "B": "Fibrous or bony ankylosis and joint subluxation",

        "D": "Bone cyst formation"
      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: B) Fibrous or bony ankylosis and joint subluxation Explanation: Chronic inflammation in rheumatoid arthritis leads to the destruction of cartilage and bone, which can cause the joint to become immobile i.e. ankylosis, either due to fibrous tissue or actual bony fusion. Joint subluxation can also occur as a result of ligament and tendon damage, leading to misalignment of the joint. Rheumatoid arthritis: Rheumatoid arthritis is a systemic disease. It is the most common cause of chronic inflammatory joint disease. Women >> Men. Common age group: Fourth or fifth decades of life. Etiology: Genetic Predisposition: Strong association with histocompatibility markers HLA-DR4/HLA-DR1. HLA-DR4 is found in ~70% of people with RA. Infectious Agents: Possible involvement of mycoplasma, clostridium, and Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) in genetically predisposed individuals. Pathogenesis: Immune Activation: APC (Antigen-presenting cells)/T-cell interaction initiates immune response and release of cytokines. Cell proliferation occurs in the synovium. Cytokine Involvement: Cytokines activate macrophages and B-cells. B-cell activation leads to anti-IgG autoantibody production. Chronic Inflammation: Immune complexes deposit in synovial joints, enhancing inflammation. Production of proteolytic enzymes, prostaglandins, TNF, and IL-1. Cartilage matrix depletion and bone damage occur due to inflammatory factors. Synovial Changes: Synovium becomes edematous, infiltrated, and filled with fibrin exudates. Hypertrophied synovium surrounds articular cartilage, forming a pannus. Cartilage loses its smooth surface and becomes eroded; pannus extends into subchondral bone. Joint Deformities: Deformities due to muscle spasms, fibrosis, and soft tissue changes. Advanced disease leads to fibrous/bony ankylosis and subluxation of joints. Osteoporosis develops in adjacent bones, and peri-articular tissues become edematous. Osteophyte formation (Option A): It refers to the development of bone spurs, commonly seen in osteoarthritis (OA) rather than rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Heberden's and Bouchard's nodes (Option C): These nodes are associated with osteoarthritis. Heberden's nodes occur at the distal interphalangeal (DIP) joints, while Bouchard's nodes occur at the proximal interphalangeal (PIP) joints. Bone cyst formation (Option D): They can occur in osteoarthritis due to bone remodeling, but they are not a common feature of rheumatoid arthritis.",

      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: B) Increased water content in the cartilage Explanation: The first change observed in osteoarthritis is increased water content (microscopic change) and loss of proteoglycans from the cartilage matrix, weakening the cartilage structure. Osteoarthritis (OA): It is the most common form of arthritis in the world. It mainly affects the hips, knees, spine, hands and feet. Types: Primary OA: It occurs in a joint de novo without any underlying cause. It occurs in old age, mainly in the weight-bearing joints (knee and hip). Secondary OA: An underlying primary disease of the joint leads to degeneration of the joint. Commonly occurs at the hip. Trauma or injury, congenital joint disorders, inflammatory arthritis, avascular necrosis, infectious arthritis, Paget disease, osteopetrosis, osteochondritis dissecans, metabolic disorders (hemochromatosis, Wilson’s disease), hemoglobinopathy, Ehlers-Danlos syndrome, or Marfan syndrome. Major risk factors for OA: Systemic predisposition: Genetics Age Gender- Women, especially post-menopausal Diet and obesity Local biomechanical factors: Abnormal joint shape and size Previous injury/trauma Neuromuscular problems Obesity Loading/occupational factors Pathogenesis: Systemic and local mechanical factors interact to initiate the osteoarthritis process. Primarily articular cartilage is affected. The first change observed is increased water content (microscopic change) and loss of proteoglycans from the cartilage matrix, weakening the cartilage structure. (Option B) Progressive softening and disintegration of articular cartilage occurs due to continued mechanical stress. As the cartilage wears away, the underlying subchondral bone becomes exposed. (Option D ruled out) Associated with new growth of cartilage and bone at joint margins forming osteophytes. (Option C ruled out) Loose flakes of cartilage can incite synovial inflammation , leading to capsular thickening and joint deformity. (Option A ruled out) Often, only one compartment of the joint is more affected. Reference: Apley and Solomon’s System of Orthopaedics and Trauma, 10th Edition, Pages 91, 94, 95, 96, 374",

        "D": "Refer for amputation of the affected foot"
      },
      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: C) Schedule surgical arthrodesis with internal fixation Explanation: Surgical arthrodesis with internal fixation is indicated for patients with chronic Charcot foot deformities who experience instability and recurrent ulcerations despite conservative treatment. It will effectively stabilize the affected joints, alleviate pain, and reduce the risk of further ulceration, making it a definitive management strategy. Restore a plantigrade foot, improving the patient's overall function and quality of life. Treatment Details General Treatment Vascular Management: Vasodilators improve blood flow Pentoxifylline enhances RBC flexibility, promotes wound healing, and maintains vascularity. Infection Control : Antibiotics are essential for managing and preventing infection. Acute Arthropathy Immobilization: Minimizes movement to protect the affected area Total Contact Casting (TCC) : Provides pressure relief while allowing mobility Encase foot and lower leg, redistributing weight with regular checks for fit(weekly) & replace them every 2 weeks. The aim of TCC is to keep the patient mobile Chronic arthropathy Rest: Essential for recovery and reducing stress on the affected area Braces : Patellar Tendon Bearing (PTB) Brace supports mobility and redistributes pressure Orthotics: Charcot Restraint Orthotic Walker prevents further damage to Charcot’s joint. Surgical Treatment Includes Open Reduction Internal Fixation (ORIF) for complex fractures Excision of bony prominences Reconstruction to restore structure Arthrodesis to fuse joints Amputation in severe cases. Management with offloading and regular follow-up (Option A): While offloading is important, this patient has already failed conservative treatment and requires a more definitive solution. Initiate pharmacologic therapy with bisphosphonates (Option B) : Pharmacologic therapy may help reduce bone resorption but does not address the underlying deformity or instability. Refer for amputation of the affected foot (Option D): This should only be considered if all other options have failed or if the patient's condition is unsuitable for further surgery. In this case, surgical intervention is warranted.",

      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: B) Perform joint aspiration and factor replacement Explanation: This is a case of acute hemarthrosis as noted by the time of onset. In acute hemarthrosis in hemophilia, the immediate focus should be on an aspiration to relieve pressure and pain, combined with factor replacement to correct the coagulation defect. Management Acute Hemarthrosis Aspiration: Aggressive management with aspiration of the joint. Factor Replacement : Regular replacement of clotting factors (e.g., Factor VIII/IX) to prevent further bleeding. NSAIDs: Use of Cox-2 inhibitors or ibuprofen for pain relief. Bupivacaine & Corticosteroids : Instillation during aspiration to reduce rebleeding risk. Bed Rest & Immobilization: Strict bed rest and limb immobilization in extension. Emergent Considerations: Special care for immature hip to prevent osteonecrosis. Primary Prophylaxis Initiated in infancy to prevent future hemarthroses and long-term disability. Surgery (Elective) Pre-Surgery Factor Replacement: Infusion 2 hours before surgery to achieve 100% factor activity continuous infusion to maintain >60% during and after surgery. Post-Surgery Monitoring: Check factor levels immediately after and then every 1-2 days. Chronic Arthritis Synovectomy: Open or arthroscopic synovectomy for recurrent hemarthrosis recommended if bleeding occurs >3 times in 6 months. Radiosynovectomy: For patients with multiple joint involvement or inhibitors. With Yttrium 90 silicate or Phosphorus 31 colloid Surgical Principles: (Post & Telfer) Tight wound closure No electrocautery, wound suction Avoid certain medications post-op. Specific Surgical Interventions Knee: TKA indicated in advanced cases; patellar resurfacing recommended. Elbow: Radial head excision with synovectomy for recurrent hemarthrosis. Hip: Total hip replacement for good outcomes. Shoulder: Arthrodesis or prosthetic replacement options. Ankle : Arthrodesis for chronic arthritis. Flexion Contractures Correction: Recommended correction of flexion contractures >30° before surgery. Hamstring Release: For knee flexion contractures <45° not amenable to conservative treatment. Osteotomy: Severe cases may require supracondylar osteotomy. Complications: Neurologic Complications: Bleeding into the central nervous system (CNS). Hemorrhage into major peripheral nerves. Joint Complications: Stiffness of affected joints. Development of contractures. Arthritis due to recurrent bleeding episodes. Other Complications: Compartment syndrome due to increased pressure from bleeding. Blood-borne infections related to repeated procedures or factor replacement. Administer oral NSAIDs and discharge home (Option B): While NSAIDs can help with pain relief, they do not address the underlying issue of hemarthrosis. Immobilize the knee in a flexed position (Option C): Immobilization is important, but it should be done in extension to prevent further complications and allow for proper healing. Flexing the knee could exacerbate swelling and pain. Refer for immediate surgical synovectomy (Option D):",
