      "question": "A 35-year-old male presents with severe low back pain radiating to the left leg. Physical examination reveals a positive straight-leg raising test at 20 degrees, and sensory loss over the dorsum of the foot. Which is the most appropriate investigation to confirm the diagnosis?",
      "options": {
        "A": "Electromyography (EMG)",
        "B": "Plain X-ray",
        "C": "MRI scan",
        "D": "Myelography"
      },
      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: C) MRI scan Explanation: The presentation of severe low back pain radiating to the left leg , along with a positive straight-leg raising test, and sensory loss over the dorsum of the foot is highly suggestive of disc prolapse , and MRI is the investigation of choice. MRI provides clear visualisation of the prolapsed disc, nerve roots, and the thecal sac , helping to confirm the diagnosis and assess the extent of nerve root compression. MRI is non-invasive and offers superior soft tissue contrast compared to other imaging techniques, making it ideal for assessing spinal disc pathology. Investigations of Disc Prolapse Investigation Details Plain X-ray (Option B) Useful to rule out bony pathology. In chronic cases, disc space narrowing and vertebral lipping may be seen. Three types of osteophytes related to the degenerative spine: Traction osteophytes, Claw osteophytes, Wrap around bumper osteophytes. Myelography (Option D) Useful when CT or MRI is unavailable. Shows dye flow block, indentation, or root cut-off sign in lateral prolapse. CT Scan Reveals disc shape abnormalities, loss of pre-thecal fat, and herniated material pressing on nerve roots or theca. MRI Scan Gold standard. Clearly shows the prolapsed disc, nerve roots, and thecal sac. Electromyography (EMG) (Option A) Rarely required, but can localize nerve root denervation, especially in multiple disc prolapse cases. Management of Disc Prolapse Treatment Details Rest Bed rest on a hard surface for 2-4 days. Drugs Analgesics and muscle relaxants for pain and muscle spasm relief. Physiotherapy Hot fomentation, gentle exercises, lumbar traction, and TENS. Surgical Treatment Indicated for cauda equina syndrome or failed conservative treatment. Fenestration : Removal of the ligamentum flavum to expose the spinal canal. Laminotomy : Creation of a small opening in the lamina for greater exposure. Hemi-laminectomy : Removal of the entire lamina on one side. Laminectomy : Removal of laminae on both sides along with the spinous process, often required for large central discs causing cauda equina syndrome. Chemonucleolysis Enzyme injection (chymopapain) into the disc to dissolve fibrous tissue. Percutaneous Discectomy Minimally invasive removal of the disc via endoscopic instruments or laser",

      "question": "An 18-year-old girl comes to the orthopedics department with complaints of deformity of her back. On physical and radiological examination she has moderate curvature of the spine with a Cobb’s angle of 30 degrees. Which of the following is not an indication of surgery for scoliosis?",
      "options": {
        "A": "Congenital scoliosis that rapidly progresses",
        "B": "Curves deteriorating on radiography",
        "C": "Postural curvature less than 30°",
        "D": "Scoliosis associated with back pain"
      },
      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: C) Postural curvature less than 30° Explanation: The clinical diagnosis here is scoliosis and for postural and structural curves that are of less than 30° , non-operative treatments are preferred and surgery is not indicated. Tests for scoliosis: Adam’s test: A prominence may become apparent when the patient bends forward. Severity of scoliosis: The severity of scoliosis is assessed by measuring the Cobb’s angle radiologically. Cobb’s angle (degree) Severity 0-10 Spinal curve 10-20 Mild scoliosis 20-40 Moderate scoliosis >40 Severe scoliosis Treatment of scoliosis: Principles of treatment The goal is to assess the prognosis of the curve based on: Type of curve Age at onset Site of the curve Prognosis: Congenital curves progress faster than idiopathic curves. Neurofibromatosis curves progress even more rapidly. Younger patients typically have worse prognosis. Thoracic curves lead to the most severe deformities. Reisser’s sign shows no more progression of the curve. Treatment guidelines: Indications for surgical intervention: Congenital scoliosis with signs of rapid curve progression, especially in the thoracic spine. (Option A) Curves deteriorating radiologically may lead to significant deformity during pubertal growth spurts. (Option B) Scoliosis is associated with back pain. (Option C) Indications for non-operative treatment: For postural curves and structural curves less than 30°. Well-balanced double curves. Non-operative methods: Exercises: to strengthen spinal muscles and support the spine. Braces: Milwaukee brace: designed for effective support. Boston brace: a more cosmetically acceptable brace. Reisser's Turn-Buckle cast: body cast with a turn-buckle to stretch the concave side of the curve. Localiser cast: body cast applied with the spine in traction, requiring a special localiser table. Operative methods: Spinal fusion: Congenital scoliosis: simple fusion is usually sufficient. Idiopathic scoliosis: achieve correction through pre-operative traction (Cotrel traction, localiser cast, halo-pelvic distraction) before fusion. Per-operative correction is achieved using: Harrington's distraction system Dwyer's compression assembly Luque-Hartshill systems",

Mechanism: typically occurs when rolling over the foot in a demi-pointe position or landing a jump. Treatment and Management: Fracture Type Conservative Treatment Surgical Treatment Zone 1 (Pseudo-Jones fractures) Protected weight-bearing with a hard-soled shoe or cast for 3-6 weeks. Surgery if >30% of the articular surface is involved or >2 mm articular step-off (open reduction and internal fixation). Zone 2 (Jones fractures) Non-weight bearing in a short leg cast for 6-8 weeks. Gradual weight-bearing as healing progresses. Surgery for high-performance athletes, patients opting for surgery, or displaced fractures (intramedullary screw or tension band fixation). Zone 3 (Stress fractures) Non-weight bearing in a short leg cast, possibly up to 20 weeks. Nonunion is common. Surgery may involve intramedullary screw fixation or bone grafting, especially for high-performance athletes. Dancer’s Fractures Weight-bearing as tolerated, same as Zone 1 treatment for nondisplaced fractures. Surgery for delayed union, nonunion, >3 mm displacement, or >10 degrees angulation.",

        "D": "Both Bohler and Gissane angles increased"
      },
      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: A) Reduced Bohler and increased Gissane angle Explanation: Reduced Bohler angle (< 20 I ) and increased Gissane angle (> 145 I ) are indicative of a calcaneal fracture. Calcaneal Fracture: Most commonly occur during high-energy events leading to axial loading of the bone. Falls from height and automobile accidents are the predominant mechanisms of injury. Vital Angles in Calcaneal Fracture: Bohler’s Angle: A line joining the highest point of the anterior process of the calcaneus and the highest point of the posterior articular facet. Another line joining the highest point of the posterior articular facet with the highest point of the calcaneal tuberosity. Angle between the two lines is Bohler’s angle. Normal value is between 25° and 40°. Angles < 20 degrees: Calcaneus fracture. Gissane Angle: A line drawn from the highest point of the posterior articular facet to the highest point of the posterior tuberosity. Another line from the former to the highest point on the anterior articular facet. Angle between the two lines is the Gissane angle. Normal angle is usually between 120° and 145°. An angle > 145 degrees: Calcaneus fracture. Classification in Calcaneal Fracture: Sanders classification: Requires the use of CT images Essex-Lopresti classification: Based on conventional radiography For accurate detection of calcaneal fracture, CT scan and 3D reconstruction is essential. Treatment: Undisplaced Fracture: Below knee plaster cast for 4 weeks followed by mobilization exercises. Displaced Fracture: Open reduction and internal fixation. Complication: Early: Swelling and blistering Compartment syndrome Late: Malunion Peroneal tendon impingement Insufficiency of the tendo achilles Talocalcaneal stiffness and osteoarthritis",

        "D": "Arthroscopic repair of meniscal tear"
      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: B) Immediate open reduction and internal fixation (ORIF) Explanation: ORIF is the standard treatment for displaced tibial condyle fractures, especially in cases where there is joint instability or significant misalignment. Early fixation helps restore joint congruency and prevent long-term complications such as arthritis. Complications Compartment syndrome: Can occur due to increased pressure in the leg compartments, requiring emergency treatment. Popliteal artery injury: Risk due to proximity of the tibial plateau to vascular structures. Peroneal nerve injury: May result in foot drop due to nerve damage. Management Non-surgical: Stable fractures, minimal displacement (elderly). Surgical (ORIF): Displaced fractures, significant depression, or bicondylar involvement (young adults). Ligament reconstruction if needed. Non-weight bearing with a knee brace (Option A): While immobilization may be part of the management, this is typically reserved for non-displaced or minimally displaced fractures. High-energy displaced fractures often require more definitive treatment. Closed reduction and casting (Option C): Casting alone is typically not sufficient for displaced fractures of the tibial condyle, as these fractures often involve joint surfaces that need anatomical restoration, which is best achieved through ORIF. Arthroscopic repair of meniscal tear (Option D): While meniscal tears may accompany tibial condyle fractures, the primary focus should be on addressing the fracture itself first. Arthroscopic interventions may be considered after fracture stabilization.",

      "question": "A 45-year-old pedestrian after being hit by a car while crossing the street. The car's bumper struck his leg from the side, impacting the knee area. On examination, there is swelling, bruising, and a noticeable valgus deformity of the knee. The patient complains of difficulty walking and inability to bear weight.

        "A": "Medial tibial condyle fracture",
        "B": "Lateral tibial condyle fracture",
        "C": "Fibular head fracture",
        "D": "Patellar fracture"
      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: B) Lateral tibial condyle fracture Explanation: A lateral tibial condyle fracture is a common injury resulting from a valgus stress to the knee, especially in pedestrian accidents involving a lateral impact from a car bumper. Hence, it is also called Bumper fracture. The valgus deformity and difficulty bearing weight strongly indicate this fracture. Classification of Tibial Plateau Fracture The tibial plateau refers to the proximal tibial surface, which comprises the medial and lateral articular surfaces of the respective tibial condyles. Lateral tibial plateau fractures are the most common. Mechanism of Injury The main mechanism of injury is a varus or valgus force, with or without axial load. Young Adults: Road traffic accidents, leading to split fractures (high ligament injury risk). Elderly: Trivial falls, causing depression or split depression fractures (associated with osteoporosis) (low ligament injury risk). Classification (Schatzker) Type I: Lateral plateau split fracture (young adults). Type II: Lateral plateau split depression (young adults). Type III: Lateral plateau pure depression (elderly). Type IV: Medial plateau fracture. Type V: Bicondylar fracture. Type VI: Dissociation of metaphysis and diaphysis. Clinical Features Knee swelling due to hemarthrosis. Inability to bear weight Reduce range of knee movements Compartment syndrome (earliest sign: stretch pain ). Imaging X-ray: Initial fracture detection. CT with 3D Reconstruction: Gold standard. MRI: To assess ligament injuries. Management Non-surgical: Stable fractures with minimal displacement. Surgical (ORIF): For displaced fractures or significant depression. Ligament reconstruction if needed. Medial tibial condyle fracture (Option A): This type of fracture is more commonly caused by varus forces or injuries to the inner side of the knee, typically involving lower-energy mechanisms, making it less likely in this scenario with a lateral impact. Fibular head fracture (Option C): Although fibular head fractures can occur with lateral knee trauma, they typically result from rotational forces or direct impact to the fibula itself, not from valgus knee deformity patterns as seen here. Patellar fracture (Option D): This injury generally occurs from direct trauma to the front of the knee or from a fall, and while possible in road traffic accidents, it is less likely in this case where the deformity and mechanism suggest lateral tibial condyle involvement.",

      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: B) Distributes hydraulic pressure across the disc and absorbs shock. Explanation: Nucleus Pulposus is the gel-like core of the disc, composed primarily of water and proteoglycans, distributing hydraulic pressure across the disc and absorbing shock during spinal movements. Intervertebral discs link vertebral bodies from C2 to S1, creating 23 discs (Cervical: 6, Thoracic: 12, Lumbar: 5) that makeup approximately 25% of the spine's height, which diminishes with age due to disc shrinkage. These discs grant flexibility and strength to the spine, acting as shock absorbers while preventing vertebrae from rubbing against one another. The most common site of disc herniation is at L5-S1 , which may be due to the thinning of the posterior longitudinal ligament towards its caudal end. The thickness of intervertebral discs increases from the cervical to lumbar regions, except at the T3-T4 level, where it is slightly reduced. The relative thickness of the discs in the cervical and lumbar regions correlates with the spine's greater range of motion in these areas. The discs in the cervical and lumbar regions are thicker anteriorly , contributing to the natural lordotic curvatures of these parts of the spine. Components of",

        "D": "The defect in compensatory scoliosis disappears when the patient bends forward"
      },
      "correct_answer": "D",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: D) The defect in compensatory scoliosis disappears when the patient bends forward patient sits and not on bending forward as in postural scoliosis . Definition : Scoliosis is a sideways curvature of the spine. Pathology: Primary Curve: lateral curvature of the spine. Compensatory Curves: curvatures that develop in the opposite direction to maintain balance. Vertebral Rotation: associated with rib prominence (rib hump) on the convex side, particularly in thoracic scoliosis. Affected Areas: any part of the thoracolumbar spine; common patterns include: Dorsal scoliosis Dorso-lumbar scoliosis Lumbar scoliosis Non-structural (transient) Structural (permanent) Temporary curvature that can be corrected. Postural scoliosis: M/c type; Often seen in adolescent girls. Mild leftward convex curve that straightens when bending forward . Compensatory scoliosis: Develops to compensate for pelvic tilt (e.g., due to hip disease or a short leg). The curve disappears when the patient sits o r when the underlying issue is resolved. (Option D) Sciatic scoliosis: Results from unilateral muscle spasms, often due to a prolapsed intervertebral disc. (Option C ruled out) Involves permanent deformity. Idiopathic scoliosis: M/c structural type, can begin in infancy, childhood, or adolescence. M/c in adolescents (Option A ruled out) Infantile scoliosis may resolve or progress, while later-onset scoliosis can lead to significant deformity, especially in the thoracic region. Congenital scoliosis: Always associated with vertebral anomalies (e.g., hemivertebrae, block vertebrae, unsegmented bars). These curves can grow rapidly and may lead to neurological deficits. (Option B ruled out) Paralytic scoliosis: Caused by unbalanced paralysis of trunk muscles, commonly due to poliomyelitis, cerebral palsy, or muscular dystrophies. Other pathologies: Conditions like neurofibromatosis can cause structural scoliosis with associated kyphosis. Radiological Features: X-ray assessment: Full anteroposterior (AP) and lateral X-rays in supine and erect positions are essential for evaluation. Cobb's Angle : Measures curve severity based on the angle formed between the lines passing through the margins of the vertebrae at the curve's ends. Risser's sign: It is a classification system that assesses the ossification of the iliac epiphysis, indicating skeletal maturity and growth potential. The ossification begins at ASIS and progresses posteriorly towards the posterior iliac spine. The classification consists of five stages: Risser’s classification Grade Ossification of I Lateral 25% II Lateral 50% III Lateral 75% IV Lateral 100% V Fusion of the ilium Risser stage 4 indicates cessation of spinal growth, while stage 5 correlates with the end of height increase. This classification is crucial for predicting scoliosis progression, as completed growth suggests a reduced risk of curve worsening. Vertebral rotation: Observed through the position of spinous processes and pedicles on AP view. Normally, the spinous process is centered but rotation causes it to shift to one side, resulting in asymmetry in pedicle positions. Indicators of congenital scoliosis: Possible findings include wedging, hemivertebrae, unsegmented bone bars, and fused ribs.

        "D": "Increase in lumbar flexion of more than 10 cm"
      },
      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: A) Increase in lumbar flexion of less than 5 cm Explanation: The Modified Schober test assesses lumbar spine mobility. In a positive test for ankylosing spondylitis, the lumbar spine shows a limited range of motion, with an increase in lumbar flexion of less than 5 cm. Normal results typically show an increase of more than 5 cm. Hence, an increase of 5 cm or greater is not suggestive of ankylosing spondylitis. Procedure: Starting Position Patient stands erect, feet shoulder-width apart. Mark 1 Mark made at the lumbosacral junction (PSIS, approx. at L5). Mark 2 Mark made 10 cm above the lumbosacral junction. Mark 3 Mark made 5 cm below the lumbosacral junction. Movement Patient bends forward (without bending knees). Measurement Distance between marks is measured in full flexion. Result: Normal Result Increase in distance by at least 5 cm (total distance ≥ 20 cm). Abnormal Result Less than 5 cm increase in distance, indicating reduced lumbar flexibility (e.g., ankylosing spondylitis).",

      "correct_answer": "D",
      "explanation": "stenosis Correct Answer: D) Undercutting facetectomies and ligamentum flavum removal is done for central stenosis Explanation: Undercutting facetectomies and ligamentum flavum removal is done for lateral recess stenosis and laminectomy is done for central canal stenosis . Spinal canal stenosis refers to reduced dimensions of the spinal canal that lead to neural compression. Lumbar Canal Stenosis Causes Congenital: Vertebral dysplasia (e.g., achondroplasia, hypochondroplasia). (Option A) Acquired: Degeneration (most common) (Option C) Spondylolysis Spondylolisthesis Iatrogenic factors Post-traumatic Local infection Metabolic conditions Anatomical Categories Central Stenosis: Involves the area between facet joints; contains dural sac and nerve roots. (Option B) Lateral Stenosis: defined by the lateral border of the dura to the medial border of the pedicle; Contains traversing nerve roots. Foraminal Stenosis: located under the pars; contains exiting nerve roots. Extraforaminal Region: lateral to the pars; may be compressed by far lateral disc protrusions. Symptoms Commonly affects women . (Option C) Complaints include aching, heaviness, numbness, and paresthesia in thighs and legs. Pain occurs after standing or walking for 5–10 minutes; relieved by sitting, squatting, or leaning (spinal claudication). Patients may prefer walking uphill for symptom relief. Unilateral symptoms may indicate foraminal stenosis. Examination Symptoms may be reproduced through walking, and neurological deficits are rare but possible. Intact pedal pulses and the absence of trophic skin changes help distinguish from vascular claudication. Differential diagnosis: Vascular claudication, hip joint pathology, and peripheral neuropathy have to be excluded Imaging In absolute stenosis, the mid-sagittal canal diameter is < 10 mm. In relative stenosis, mid-sagittal canal diameter is between 10–13 mm. MRI: Preferred CT myelography: Indicated if MRI is contraindicated and is useful for dynamic stenosis. Treatment Conservative management: First-line treatment for mild symptoms includes patient education, analgesics (e.g., paracetamol, NSAIDs), non-impact exercise, and epidural steroid injections. Surgical Treatment: Is indicated for severe symptoms or failure of conservative treatment. A posterior decompression needs to be done by methods like: Laminectomy for central stenosis. Undercutting facetectomies and ligamentum flavum removal for lateral recess stenosis. Care is taken to preserve facet joints to prevent instability. A spinal fusion may be required for foraminal stenosis and cases involving spondylolysis, spondylolisthesis, scoliosis, and kyphosis. The SPORT (Spine Patient Outcomes Research Trial) shows that surgery is a more cost-effective method than non-operative treatment.",

Observation and modifying activities allow for monitoring and potential stabilization as the child grows, particularly when there are no neurological deficits or severe symptoms. Clinical Features of Different Types of Spondylolisthesis Feature Isthmic Congenital Degenerative Symptoms Asymptomatic or low back pain. History of trauma in 50% of cases. Common in both adults and children. Pain in lower back, buttocks, legs, and toes. Known as pseudospondylolisthesis. Intermittent symptoms, especially in the elderly. More common in women (5 times) and affects 4-10% of the population. Pain in the back, buttock, or thigh. Deformity Increased lumbar lordosis. Palpable step at L5–S1 . (Step sign) Short torso, protruding abdomen. Transverse furrow at L5. Vertical sacrum. Flat buttocks and hamstring tightness. Prominent L5 spinous process . Scoliosis present in 13%. Scoliosis and pelvic waddle. Flat buttocks. Stiffness of the spine ; limited bending. Stiffness of spine. Neurological Issues Rare involvement of L5 nerve root. Involvement of L5 or S1 nerve root ; L5 involvement is rare. Neurological claudication . Commonly affects L3–4. X-ray Examination for Spondylolisthesis Lateral View: Shows anterior displacement of one vertebra over another. Oblique View: Reveals defects in the pars interarticularis. Normal appearance Spondylolysis Spondylolisthesis Resembles a Scottish dog Collar Appearance : Indicates a defect in the isthmus (pars interarticularis) Defect without vertebral displacement Separated Head and Neck Defect with vertebral displacement Principles of Treatment Conservative Management Rest and external support for the affected area. Flexion exercises to strengthen the back. Recommendation to change to a less physically demanding job. Surgical Management Indications Failure of conservative therapy Signs of nerve root compression Slippage greater than 30% even without pain Persistent pain in the back, thigh, or sciatica Surgical Methods : Posterolateral Fusion: Preferred method; preserves soft tissue and has a high fusion rate. Posterior Fusion : Risk of additional slip postoperatively; often combined with intertransverse fusion. Laminectomy: Relieves neurological deficits; usually followed by posterolateral fusion. Laminectomy and Intertransverse Fusion : Additional stabilization method. Anterior Interbody Fusion : Used for subtotal spondylolisthesis; complex and with uncertain efficacy. Methods of Fusion and Stabilization: Autologous cancellous bone grafting combined with devices like Hartshill rectangle frame or Steffee plate and screws for stabilization. Radiographs showing posterior spinal stablization by Steffee plate and screws Spondyloptosis It refers to grade V spondylolisthesis , where a vertebra has moved so far forward relative to the one below that their endplates no longer align .

      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Correct answer: B) Isthmic Explanation: Given the patient's age, activity level, and the presence of a defect in the pars interarticularis, isthmic spondylolisthesis due to a fatigue fracture is the most likely diagnosis. Pars interarticularis is the part of the vertebra bridging the superior and inferior articular facets. Spondylolisthesis It refers to the forward displacement of a vertebra over the one beneath it Commonly occurring at the L5-S1 and L4-L5 levels. Spondylolysis refers to a defect in the pars without the vertebra slipping forward . Classification Dysplastic (Option A) Least common type Caused by congenital anomalies in the upper sacrum or L5 arch, facilitating the slip. Isthmic (Option B) The most common type Involving a lesion in the pars interarticularis, which can be further divided into three subtypes: Lytic : A fatigue fracture of the pars interarticularis. Intact but elongated : The pars interarticularis remains intact but is elongated. Acute fracture : A recent fracture of the pars interarticularis. The defect causes the anterior half of the vertebra to slip forward while the posterior half remains with the lower vertebra. Degenerative (Option C) Results from long-term intersegmental instability , where the pars remains intact, but degenerative changes in the facet joints permit forward slipping. Common in older adults, where instability in the posterior facet joints due to osteoarthritis can lead to displacement, occasionally backwards (retrolisthesis). Severe displacement and neurological issues are rare. Traumatic (Option D) This results from fractures in other parts of the bony structure rather than in the pars interarticularis. Pathological Caused by generalized or localized bone diseases that weaken the vertebral articulations. Meyer Ding's Classification Grade Percentage of Forward Displacement G1 Up to 25% G2 25% to 50% G3 50% to 70% G4 Greater than 75% G5 >100% - Spondyloptosis The percentage of displacement is determined by measuring the upper vertebra's shift relative to the lower vertebral body on a lateral plain X-ray of the lumbar spine.",

      "explanation": "Correct Answer: D) S1 root Explanation: S1 root involvement is suggested by the clinical features: weakness of the plantar-flexors of the foot, sensory loss over the lateral side of the foot, and a sluggish ankle jerk (S1, S2). The straight-leg raising test, positive at 25 degrees, indicates significant nerve root compression, often seen with S1 root involvement. Level Nerve Root Affected Motor Weakness Sensory Loss Reflexes L5–S1 S1 root Weakness of plantar-flexors of the foot Over the lateral side of the foot Ankle jerk sluggish or absent L4–L5 L5 root (Option C) Weakness of Extensor hallucis longus and dorsiflexors of the foot Over the dorsum of the foot and lateral side of the leg Ankle jerk normal L3–L4 L4 root (Option B) Weakness of extensors of the knee Over the great toe and medial side of the leg Knee jerk sluggish or absent L1-L4 L2, L3, L4 roots (Option A) Weakness of hip flexion and adduction, knee extension Over the anterior thigh and sometimes medial lower leg Decreased patellar reflex Clinical Features of Disc Prolapse Clinical Feature Description Age and Lifestyle Typically affects adults aged 20-40, particularly those with a sedentary lifestyle. Low Back Pain (LBP) Most common symptom.Can be acute or chronic. Acute LBP: Intense pain and muscle spasms. Chronic LBP: Dull, worsened by exertion, relieved by rest. Sciatica Pain radiating down the leg. S1 root compression causes pain to the postero-lateral calf and heel. L5 root compression affects the anterolateral leg and ankle. Neurological Symptoms Paresthesia (\"pins and needles\"), numbness, muscle weakness. In severe cases, cauda equina syndrome can occur, leading to paralysis and incontinence. Posture The patient stands with a rigid lumbar spine, and the trunk tilted forward or sideways (Sciatic tilt). Movement Limitation Restricted forward bending due to severe paraspinal muscle spasm. Tenderness Diffuse tenderness in the lumbosacral region, with localized tenderness near spinous processes in some cases. Diagnostic Tests for Disc Prolapse Test Description Straight-leg Raising (SLR) Test The leg is raised until pain is felt in the buttock, thigh, or calf. Pain typically occurs between 30-70 degrees. Indicates lumbosacral root tension or disc prolapse. Lasègue's Test Extension of the knee in a raised leg. Normally, the limb can be raised 80-90 degrees, but disc prolapse reduces this to under 30 degrees due to severe pain. Dorsiflexion of the foot worsens the pain. Neurological Examination Assesses motor weakness, sensory loss, or reflex loss corresponding to the affected nerve root. L5 root affects extensor hallucis longus, tested by dorsiflexion of the big toe. Sensory loss in the corresponding dermatome.",

      "explanation": "→ Nucleus displacement → Fibrosis and calcification Correct Answer: B) Nucleus degeneration → Nucleus displacement → Fibrosis and calcification first , leading to softening and fragmentation of the nucleus. (Option B, C and D ruled out) This is followed by displacement of the nucleus , where it bulges or extrudes through the weakened annulus fibrosus. The final stage involves fibrosis and calcification of the remaining nucleus material as part of the repair process. The most common site of disc herniation is at L5-S1 , which may be due to the thinning of the posterior longitudinal ligament towards its caudal end.
