      "explanation": "Correct Answer: D) Hydroxyapatite Explanation: The inorganic component of the bone’s extracellular matrix is majorly composed of hydroxyapatite, whereas the organic component is made of collagen and noncollagenous proteins like sialoproteins, osteocalcin, and osteonectin . The components of bone are as follows: The organic component of the extracellular matrix is made of type I collagen (90%), a triple-helical molecule, and the rest by the non-collagenous proteins (10%). Collagen gives tensile strength to the bones. Non-collagenous proteins like sialoproteins , osteomectin , osteocalcin , and alkaline phosphatases form 10% of the organic component. (Option A, B & C) The inorganic component, majorly composed of hydroxyapatite, has impurities like Carbonate substituting the phosphate groups. Potassium, strontium, magnesium, and sodium replacing the calcium ions. Chloride and fluoride replacing the hydroxyl groups.

      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: C) Sesamoid bone Explanation: The clinical scenario here explains the formation of small bones in a patient's tendons called sesamoid bones, which are formed due to friction between the tendons. Long bones: Length greater than breadth; found in limbs. Examples: Humerus, femur, radius, tibia, metacarpals, metatarsals, phalanges. The shaft contains a medullary cavity with bone marrow. The ends are articular, covered by articular cartilage. Shaft: compact bone; Ends: cancellous bone with a thin, compact layer. Short bones: Cubical or cuboidal shape; found mainly in hands and feet . Examples: Tarsals (calcaneus, talus), carpals (scaphoid, lunate). Predominantly cancellous bone with a thin surrounding layer of compact bone. Many are covered by periosteum. Flat bones: Flat appearance; found in the skull and thoracic cage Examples: frontal and parietal bones, scapula, sternum, ribs Two layers of compact bone (tables) with cancellous bone (diploe) in between. Sesamoid bones: Develop in tendons due to friction. Seed-like appearance (Arabic: sesame = seed). Largest: Patella (in the tendon of quadriceps femoris). The articular surface is covered with cartilage and lacks periosteum. Pneumatic bones (Option B) : Pneumatic bones contain air-filled cavities, making them lighter and less dense than solid bones Found in some skull bones (e.g., frontal, maxillary, sphenoid, ethmoid).

        "D": "Small capillary loops that create sites for bacterial trapping."
      },
      "correct_answer": "D",
      "explanation": "Correct answer: D) Small capillary loops that create sites for bacterial trapping. Explanation: In this case, the boy has signs of infections and inflammation (fever, pain, and elevated blood markers), and the X-ray shows osteolytic lesions with ill-defined margins, which is suggestive of Osteomyelitis . The metaphysis is vulnerable to infections like osteomyelitis due to its rich blood supply & slow-flowing capillary loops . These loops create an environment conducive to trapping microorganisms, allowing bacteria to settle and multiply, increasing the risk of infection . Parts of a Long Bone: Diaphysis : Forms the bone shaft and ossifies from the primary centre . Composed of a thick layer of compact bone and a thin layer of spongy bone surrounding the marrow cavity. Provides strength and is significant in muscle attachment but heals slowly compared to the metaphysis. It can remodel angulations but not rotation and is prone to fractures , infections, and tumors. Epiphysis : Develops from secondary centres of ossification . Located at the ends of the bone, supporting joint surfaces and bearing pressure. Susceptible to developmental issues (e.g., dysplasia, trauma, overuse), which can lead to joint deformities due to avascular necrosis and degeneration. Epiphyseal Cartilage (Growth Plate/Physis) : A cartilage plate between the diaphysis and epiphysis in growing bones. Responsible for longitudinal bone growth ; replaced",

        "D": "Produces synovial fluid"
      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Correct answer: B) Regulates bone remodeling Explanation: The endosteum contains both osteoblasts and osteoclasts , which are essential for maintaining bone health through the remodeling process . In osteoporosis, imbalances in these activities can lead to increased bone loss, particularly from the endosteal surface. Bone Marrow: Found in the marrow cavity of long bones and small cavities of short bones. In flat and irregular bones, it fills spaces in the cancellous bone. Red and Yellow Marrow : At birth , all marrow is red and haematopoietic (produces blood cells). With age , red marrow gradually converts to yellow marrow (fatty tissue). Conversion begins in the distal limbs around age 10 and progresses with age. In adults, red marrow is found in the skull, vertebral column, girdle bones, thoracic cage, and the heads of the humerus and femur. Red marrow remains in the sternum throughout life. Functions : Red marrow produces red and white blood cells. Yellow marrow consists mainly of fat cells . Gelatinous marrow , a degenerated form, appears in elderly people. Periosteum Covers the external surface of bones (except articular surfaces). Consists of an outer fibrous layer and an inner osteogenic (cellular) layer. The inner layer contains osteoblasts (bone-forming cells). Function Adheres closely to bones through Sharpey's fibres . Provides blood vessels to the bone. Contains osteoclasts (bone-destroying cells) and sensory nerves (causing pain during fractures). Essential for bone growth, repair, and protection. Endosteum : A thin layer covering the internal surfaces of bone . Contains both osteoblasts and osteoclasts .",

They primarily form in compact bone through continuous remodeling, particularly in adults. In long bones , osteons are aligned parallel to each other, and the bone's long axis, appearing round in cross-sections. Each osteon has a central Haversian canal , which allows vasculature, nerves, and lymphatics to pass through. Osteoblasts produce 5–20 rings of lamellar bone that radiate outward from the Haversian canal. Volkmann’s canals connect Haversian canals and run obliquely to the osteons. Osteocyte Formation: Osteocytes are osteoblasts that become trapped in lacunae as they secrete osteoid. These osteocytes are aligned with the lamellar rings of the osteon. Canaliculi are small channels that connect lacunae and radiate perpendicularly, allowing osteocytes to extend cellular processes and communicate through gap junctions . Function: Osteons provide mechanical support and strength to bones through their thick lamellar rings. They protect the bone’s vascular supply and continuously remodel in response to biomechanical stress.",

      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "→ 3 → 1 → 4 Correct Answer: B) 2 → 3 → 1 → 4 Explanation: The bone remodelling cycle starts with the activation of osteoclasts by the osteoblast cells and finally ends with the formation of osteoid and a “cement” line between the new and old bone. Bone Remodelling: Definition : Bone remodelling is the coordinated process of bone removal and replacement involving osteoblasts and osteoclasts. Purpose: Replaces old bone with new bone. Protects the skeleton from fatigue damage and stress failure. Adapts bone structure to functional demands (trabeculae thickness varies with stress). Maintains calcium homeostasis through constant mineral turnover. The bone remodelling cycle: Osteoblasts prompt osteoclasts to excavate a cavity on the bone surface. Resorption occurs for 2–4 weeks , followed by osteoclast apoptosis and phagocytosis . A quiescent period follows, after which osteoblasts cover the cavity and lay down osteoid for about 3 months . The complete remodelling cycle lasts 4 to 6 months , marked by a 'cement line' between old and new bone. Regulatory mechanisms: Osteoblasts and osteoclasts function as bone remodelling units, with over a million units active in adults. Systemic hormones (e.g., PTH, 1,25-(OH)2D) and local growth factors coordinate formation and resorption. Factors influencing remodelling include sex steroids, dietary factors, and mechanical stresses. Long-term changes: Annual bone turnover: approximately 4% for cortical bone and 25% for trabecular bone. During early life, formation slightly exceeds resorption, increasing bone mass. In later years, resorption exceeds formation, leading to a gradual decrease in bone mass and strength. Excessive resorption can cause fragility fractures due to loss of trabecular connections.",

      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: C) 1, 2, and 5 Explanation: Classical signs of a fracture typically include: Tenderness (1): This is a hallmark sign due to localized injury to the bone. Deformity (2): Fractures often result in visible or palpable deformity, indicating misalignment of the bone. Abnormal movement (5): This is indicative of instability at the fracture site, where the bone is not maintaining its normal structural integrity. Other signs, such as bruising (3) and loss of function (4) , can occur in various types of injuries but are not specific to fractures. Fracture A fracture is defined as a breach in the continuity of a bone or periosteum, or both. Even a small tear in the periosteum can be considered a fracture. This breach can occur due to various causes, such as trauma, overuse, or underlying bone pathology (like osteoporosis or cancer). Classical Clinical Signs of a Fracture Tenderness Localized pain at the site of the fracture when pressure is applied. Often the first sign noted in trauma cases. Crepitus A grating or crackling sensation felt or heard when the broken bone ends move against each other. Abnormal Mobility Movement of the bone at a point where there is no natural joint, indicating a loss of continuity in the bone. Deformity Visible misalignment or abnormal positioning of the bone due to displacement of bone fragments. Loss of Transmitted Movements Absence of force transmission along the bone, such as in long bones, where tapping the distal end does not transmit vibrations to the proximal end.

        "D": "Adolescents after epiphyseal closure"
      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: B) Children before epiphyseal closure Explanation: Greenstick fractures are partial fractures where the bone bends and cracks on one side without breaking completely. They are most common in children due to their growing bones, which have a higher cartilage content, making them more pliable. The presence of epiphyseal plates (growth plates) allows children's bones to bend under stress instead of breaking entirely. Greenstick Fracture Definition A greenstick fracture is an incomplete fracture commonly seen in children, where one cortex of the bone is broken while the other cortex remains intact, resembling the bending and partial breaking of a young, flexible bamboo. Common Sites Most Common Fracture in Children: Occurs before epiphyseal closure, predominantly in children aged 4 to 10 years. Most Affected Bone: Typically involves the forearm bones (radius and ulna). Clinical Features Patients often present with pain, tenderness, and swelling over the affected area. There may be a limitation in the range of motion. The mechanism of injury often involves a fall or a direct blow to the arm. Diagnosis X-ray: Shows a small opening or a line at one cortex with the other cortex remaining intact. Radiographic appearance resembles a bending of the bone rather than a complete break. Analogy The term \"greenstick\" is derived from the analogy of young bamboo; when young bamboo is broken, only one cortex breaks, similar to this type of fracture, whereas mature bamboo may break both cortices. Treatment Conservative Management: Treatment typically involves immobilization with a Plaster of Paris (POP) cast. In cases where the intact cortex is also fractured, additional casting may be required to ensure complete healing and prevent complications such as delayed union or non-union. Surgical Intervention: Generally not performed before epiphyseal closure, as conservative management is sufficient for healing. Prognosis Greenstick fractures generally heal well with appropriate treatment, and complete recovery is expected within a few weeks, depending on the child's age and bone growth potential.",

      "question": "A 10-year-old schoolboy was playing on the monkey bars during recess when he suddenly slipped and fell onto his outstretched hand. He immediately felt intense pain in his wrist. On examination, there is significant swelling and tenderness over the wrist. An X-ray of the wrist reveals specific findings indicative of a fracture. Based on the history, clinical features, and X-ray findings, what is the most likely diagnosis?",

      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: C) Torus fracture Explanation: 10-year-old boy who fell onto an outstretched hand, a common mechanism for wrist injuries in children. The intense pain he experienced immediately after the fall aligns with this type of injury. The X-ray findings show a subtle bulging of the cortex in the distal radius without a visible fracture line, which is characteristic of a torus fracture. This injury occurs due to the flexibility of pediatric bones, resulting in compression rather than a complete break. Torus (buckle) fractures Definition Torus fractures,",
