      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "deformities is typical of CTEV. Equinus refers to a condition where the foot is in a plantarflexed position, pointing downward. Inversion refers to a position where the foot points inward. Forefoot adduction refers to a position where the forefoot turns inward. Cavus refers to high arch in foot. Congenital Talipes EquinoVarus (CTEV) or club foot Most common congenital malformations characterised by varying degrees and severity of predictable contractures. Four components: Midfoot cavus Forefoot adductus Heel/Hindfoot varus Hindfoot equinus Etiology: Maternal smoking and maternal diabetes have strong association. Maternal alcohol consumption. Strongly associated with congenital myotonic dystrophy, myelomeningocele, distal arthrogryposis, trisomy 18 and chromosome 22q11 deletion syndrome. Pathophysiology: The deformity predominantly exists in the tarsal bones which are in the position of maximum flexion and adduction. The talus is characteristically medially deviated while the calcaneus is in varus and rotated medially around the talus. The navicular and cuboid are displaced medially. Clubfoot can be associated with: Arthrogryposis Myelomeningocele Amniotic band syndrome Spina bifida Radiography is the most important investigation Reference: Apley and Solomon’s System of Orthopedics and Trauma, 10th Edition, Page 614",

        "D": "Brachydactyly"
      },
      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: A) Syndactyly Explanation: Syndactyly refers to the fusion of digits (as shown in the image). It can involve only skin or both skin and bone and only a part of the webspace or completely. Syndactyly Classification: Simple Syndactyly Only soft tissue is fused Complex Syndactyly Both skin and bone are fused Complete Syndactyly Webbing along the entire length of affected digits Incomplete Syndactyly Webbing along only part of the length of the affected digits. Complicated Syndactyly Accessory Phalanges or abnormal bones involved in fusion. Treatment of Syndactyly: Nonoperative Management Mild or incomplete syndactyly and syndactyly of toes are often managed non-operatively, especially when the function is unaffected. Operative Management Surgical Timing: Performed around 12-18 months of age to reduce scar contractures. Early surgery (around 6 months) is advised for border digits (thumb, little finger) to prevent deformity. Surgical Technique: Zigzag incisions (e.g., the Cronin technique ) are used to separate digits and minimise scar contracture. Avoid simultaneous separation of both sides of a digit to protect blood supply. Complex Syndactyly: May require bone separation (synostosis) with techniques like closing wedge osteotomies/ amputation Incorrect Options: Symphalangism (Option B): It is manifested as partial or total absence of one or more interphalangeal joints. There will be a fusion of the involved phalanges. It is seen in fingers/toes. Polydactyly (Option C): Polydactyly/ hyperdactyly is characterized by an extra finger either in the hand or toe. Brachydactyly (Option D): Brachydactyly is a congenital condition characterized by disproportionately short fingers and toes.",

      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: C) Perthes disease Explanation: The clinical scenario of a young boy with antalgic gait, limping and restricted internal rotation is suggestive of Perthes disease . Perthes disease, also known as Legg-Calvé-Perthes disease , is an idiopathic avascular necrosis of the femoral head that typically affects children between the ages of 4 and 10. Legg-Calvé-Perthes disease: Description Idiopathic osteonecrosis or idiopathic avascular necrosis of the capital femoral epiphysis of the femoral head. Etiopathogenesis Idiopathic or etiology that would disrupt the blood flow to femoral epiphysis. Coagulopathy and steroid use. Includes 4 phases Necrosis: Disruption of the blood supply leads to infarction of the femoral capital epiphysis. Fragmentation: The body reabsorbs the infarcted bone. Reossification: Osteoblastic activity takes over, and the femoral epiphysis reestablishes. Remodeling: The new femoral head may be enlarged or flattened. It reshapes during growth. Risk factors Familial ~ 10% Factor V Leiden /Thrombophilias (increased clotting) Hypofibrinolysis (decreased ability to dissolve clots) Low socioeconomic status Birth weight less than 2.5 kg in boys Clinical features Limp of acute or insidious onset, usually painless. If pain is present, it is localized to the hip or knee. Decreased internal rotation and abduction of hip. Atrophy of thighs and buttocks. Limb length discrepancy. Antalgic gait in acute cases and Trendelenburg gait in chronic cases. Diagnosis Standard anteroposterior pelvis and frog-leg lateral (Lauenstein) X-ray views. Bone scan or MRI Early findings: Widening of joint space (epiphyseal cartilage hypertrophy) Changes in the epiphysis. Crescent sign: Subchondral radiolucent zone of the anterolateral epiphysis Late signs: Flattening of the femoral head. Bone scan shows decreased perfusion to the femoral head. Treatment Non operative: Indicated for children with bone age less than 6 or lateral pillar A involvement. Activity restriction and protective weight-bearing are recommended until ossification is complete. Operative treatment: Femoral or Pelvic Osteotomy indicated in children older than 8 years. Valgus or Shelf Osteotomies indicated in children with hinge abduction Hip replacement procedures: if Arthritis has developed Incorrect options: DDH (developmental dysplasia of hip) (Option A): Disorder of abnormal development of the hip . This can result in dysplasia, subluxation, and sometimes dislocation of the hip secondary to capsular laxity and mechanical instability. It is more commonly seen in females. Usual presentation is < 2 years of age. Slipped capital femoral epiphysis (Option B): SCFE, is a common condition wherein the metaphysis is slipped relative to the epiphysis. It is seen in obese males , more commonly among adolescent males. Unlike Perthes, SCFE is a painless condition. Congenital coxa vara (Option D): Coxa vara is either a congenital deformity or caused by injury of the hip. In this condition, the patient presents with a waddling gait and the femoral neck-shaft angle is decreased, usually less than 120 degrees.",

        "C": "Backward bending test",
        "D": "Single leg standing test"
      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: B) Forward bending test Explanation: Scoliosis screening in school children is typically done using the forward bending test, also known as the Adam's forward bend test. During this test, the child bends forward at the waist with arms extended towards the floor. This allows for the assessment of any asymmetry or abnormal curvature of the spine, which can indicate the presence of scoliosis. Scoliosis is a sideways curvature of the spine. Pathology: Primary Curve: lateral curvature of the spine. Compensatory Curves: curvatures that develop in the opposite direction to maintain balance. Vertebral Rotation: associated with rib prominence (rib hump) on the convex side, particularly in thoracic scoliosis. Affected Areas: any part of the thoracolumbar spine; common patterns include: Dorsal scoliosis Dorso-lumbar scoliosis Lumbar scoliosis Non-structural (transient) Structural (permanent) Temporary curvature that can be corrected. Postural scoliosis: M/c type; Often seen in adolescent girls. Mild leftward convex curve that straightens when bending forward . Compensatory scoliosis: Develops to compensate for pelvic tilt (e.g., due to hip disease or a short leg). The curve disappears when the patient sits o r when the underlying issue is resolved. Sciatic scoliosis: Results from unilateral muscle spasms, often due to a prolapsed intervertebral disc. Involves permanent deformity. Idiopathic scoliosis: M/c structural type, can begin in infancy, childhood, or adolescence. M/c in adolescents Infantile scoliosis may resolve or progress, while later-onset scoliosis can lead to significant deformity, especially in the thoracic region. Congenital scoliosis: Always associated with vertebral anomalies (e.g., hemivertebrae, block vertebrae, unsegmented bars). These curves can grow rapidly and may lead to neurological deficits. Paralytic scoliosis: Caused by unbalanced paralysis of trunk muscles, commonly due to poliomyelitis, cerebral palsy, or muscular dystrophies. Other pathologies: Conditions like neurofibromatosis can cause structural scoliosis with associated kyphosis. Radiological Features: X-ray assessment: Full anteroposterior (AP) and lateral X-rays in supine and erect positions are essential for evaluation. Cobb's Angle : Measures curve severity based on the angle formed between the lines passing through the margins of the vertebrae at the curve's ends. Risser's sign: It is a classification system that assesses the ossification of the iliac epiphysis, indicating skeletal maturity and growth potential. The ossification begins at ASIS and progresses posteriorly towards the posterior iliac spine. The classification consists of five stages: Risser’s classification Grade Ossification of I Lateral 25% II Lateral 50% III Lateral 75% IV Lateral 100% V Fusion of the ilium Risser stage 4 indicates cessation of spinal growth, while stage 5 correlates with the end of height increase. This classification is crucial for predicting scoliosis progression, as completed growth suggests a reduced risk of curve worsening. Vertebral rotation: Observed through the position of spinous processes and pedicles on AP view. Normally, the spinous process is centered, but rotation causes it to shift to one side, resulting in asymmetry in pedicle positions. Indicators of congenital scoliosis: Possible findings include wedging, hemivertebrae, unsegmented bone bars, and fused ribs. Neurofibromatosis: Due to associated neurofibromas, it may show vertebral body erosion and widened intervertebral foramina. Normal curvatures of the spine:",

        "B": "Distal tibia",
        "C": "Proximal femur",

      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: A) Proximal tibia Explanation: Blount Disease is characterized by pathologic tibial varus deformity, often seen in young children, and is linked with abnormal growth of the medial part of the proximal tibial growth plate. Blount disease: Blount disease, also known as tibia vara, is an acquired genu varus deformity in children caused by disrupted normal cartilage growth at the proximal medial metaphysis of the tibia. This condition develops due to excessive compressive forces on the medial aspect of the proximal tibial physis, leading to altered enchondral bone formation. Etiopathogenesis: Genetic susceptibility Mechanical overloading of the tibia especially in children who are overweight and started walking earlier. Blount disease results from growth inhibition induced by excessive compressive forces, leading to cartilage damage and a subsequent delay in ossification. Mechanical overload leads to altered enchondral bone formation. Two forms of Blount disease Infantile Blount disease Adolescent Blount disease Diagnosed in children between age 1-3 years. Bilateral condition. Characterised by varus deformity of tibia with identification of lateral thrust. Emerges in children in their late childhood or early adolescent. Unilateral or bilateral conditions. Characterised by pain in the medial aspect of the knee. Diagnosis: Accurate measurement requires bilateral projection of the radiograph from the hip to the ankle. Angles for Blount disease detection Angles Description Metaphyseal-Diaphyseal angle(MDA) The intersection occurs between a line drawn from the most distal point on the medial and lateral beaks of the tibial metaphysis to a line perpendicular to the long axis of the tibial diaphysis. An angle >16° is associated with a 95% risk of deformity progression. An angle <10° is likely physiological, with a 95% chance of spontaneous resolution. An angle between 11° and 16° necessitates close observation for the potential tibia vara progression. Tibiofemoral angle Measures the severity of varus deformity. Medial Metaphyseal Beak angle(MMBA) Diagnostic screening tool for individual risk of blount disease. MRI effectively assesses cartilage, menisci, ligaments and vascularity of the physis. Differential Diagnosis: Physiological bowing of the legs Ollier disease Metaphyseal Chondrodysplasia Thrombocytopenia absent radius syndrome Treatment: Treatment of Blount's disease depends on the child's age and the severity of the deformity. Brace: KAFO are potential treatment options for children diagnosed before age 4. Guided growth or Hemiepiphysiodesis is a surgical technique designed to correct angular limb deformities in skeletally immature patients progressively. Osteotomy : Realignment osteotomy is typically performed before age 4 in pediatric patients with documented and progressive Blount disease Distal tibia (Option B): Blount disease primarily affects the proximal tibia, not the distal tibia. Proximal femur (Option C): Blount disease is a tibial condition, not related to the femur. Distal femur (Option D): Blount disease involves the tibia, not the distal femur.",

X-ray findings would show collapse or flattening of the femoral head, not the changes seen in DDH. SCFE (Option B) (Slipped Capital Femoral Epiphysis): SCFE involves the slipping of the femoral head on the neck, usually occurring during adolescence. It presents with a limp and restricted hip movement, but X-rays would show a displacement of the femoral head relative to the neck, not typical for DDH. Fracture neck of femur (Option D): A fracture would typically present with acute pain, inability to move the hip, and a history of trauma. X-rays would show a clear fracture, which is not consistent with DDH.",

      "explanation": "is a common congenital deformity characterized by an abnormal inward and downward positioning of the foot. In the initial management of clubfoot, the goal is to gradually correct the deformity while the foot is still malleable such as in this 6-month-old infant. Manipulation and casting involve gently manipulating the foot and ankle into the correct position, followed by applying a cast that maintains the correction. This process is repeated every 1-2 weeks until the foot is fully corrected, taking several months. Ponseti method of serial manipulation and casting is the gold standard. Incorrect Options: Option B - Posteromedial Soft Tissue Release: Postero-medial soft tissue release (PMSTR) is a surgical procedure used to correct clubfoot deformity in older children or adults. It involves releasing the tight tendons and ligaments on the inside of the foot and ankle, which allows the foot to be placed in a more normal position. PMSTR is reserved for patients who have not responded to conservative treatment",

Therefore, option B is the correct option Incorrect Options: Option A - 1, 2, 3 are correct: This option is incorrect because statement 2 is incorrect. The forefoot in CTEV is adducted (turned inward), but it is not supinated (tilted upward). Instead, the forefoot is usually in a pronated position (tilted downward).
