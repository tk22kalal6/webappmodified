      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: B) Cold abscess without neurological complication Explanation: Cold abscess without neurological complication in a patient with Pott's spine can be managed conservatively with anti-tuberculosis medication. Surgery is typically not indicated in such cases, as long as there are no neurological complications. Surgical procedures: Costo-transversectomy Anterolateral decompression HONGKONG procedure: Anterior decompression and spinal fusion Laminectomy Indications for surgery in patients without neurological complications Indications for surgery in patients with neurological complications Progressive bone destruction despite ATT Failure to respond to conservative therapy Paravertebral abscess when it has increased in size despite medical treatment Spinal instability caused by destruction or collapse, destruction of two or more vertebrae, kyphosis Prevention of severe kyphosis in young children with extensive dorsal lesions Large paraspinal abscess New or worsening neural complications or lack of improvement with conservative treatment Paraplegia of rapid onset or severe paraplegia Late-onset paraplegia Neural arch disease Painful paraplegia in elderly patients Spinal tumor syndrome (epidural spinal tuberculoma without osseous involvement) Middle path regimen in managing Pott’s spine: Regimen: Medical management in all patients + surgical management in the following situations: Lack of response to chemotherapy Recurrent disease Severe neurological weakness Static or progressive neuro deficit despite a course of ATT Deformity Debilitating pain Instability Reference: Apley and Solomon’s System of Orthopaedics and Trauma, Edition 10th- Page 509, 510 Garg RK, Somvanshi DS.

      "question": "A 40-year-old man is suffering from increasing difficulty in bending forward with stiffness of the spine and reduced chest movements. A CT was performed and is shown below. What is the likely diagnosis?",
      "options": {
        "A": "Ankylosing spondylitis",

        "D": "Fluorosis"
      },
      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: A) Ankylosing spondylitis Explanation: Ankylosing spondylitis is a chronic inflammatory condition that primarily affects the spine. Ankylosing Spondylitis (AS) / Marie Strumpell Disease Definition Chronic inflammatory disease primarily affecting the axial skeleton (spine and sacroiliac joints), leading to pain, stiffness, and spinal fusion Etiology Unknown; genetic (HLA-B27) and environmental factors involved. HLA-B27 is positive in 90% of cases, but not all carriers develop AS. Pathophysiology Inflammation at entheses → Erosive changes → New bone formation → Syndesmophytes → Spinal fusion (ankylosis). Clinical Features Musculoskeletal Symptoms: Chronic low back pain (worse after inactivity, better with activity) Limited spinal mobility Enthesitis (Achilles, plantar fascia) Peripheral arthritis (hips, shoulders, knees) Extra-articular Symptoms: Ocular: Anterior uveitis (pain, redness, photophobia) Cardiovascular: Aortic regurgitation, conduction",

      "question": "The brace shown in the given image is:",
      "options": {
        "A": "Boston brace",
        "B": "Milwaukee brace",
        "C": "Taylor brace",
        "D": "ASHE brace"
      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: B) Milwaukee brace Explanation: The given image represents the Milwaukee brace. The Milwaukee brace is used for structural scoliosis and fits snugly over the pelvis. It includes chin and head pads for active postural correction and a thoracic pad that presses on the ribs at the apex of the curve. While it is cumbersome , if well-made, it does not significantly interfere with activity. However, bracing is now used less frequently due to doubts about its effectiveness in altering the progression of scoliosis. Boston brace (Option A) : The Boston brace is used for low lumbar curves in scoliosis and does not include a head or chin component. It is a more streamlined brace that typically only covers the torso. Taylor brace (Option C) : The Taylor brace is used for spinal fractures or for patients recovering from spinal surgery. It provides support to the lumbar and lower thoracic spine but does not have the design elements (chin or head pads) seen in the Milwaukee brace. ASHE brace (Option D) : The ASHE (Anterior Spinal Hyperextension) brace is used to provide hyperextension support for the lumbar spine but is not used for scoliosis. It has a completely different structure compared to the Milwaukee brace.",

      "question": "To which part of the vertebra are the screws fixed in spine fusion surgery?",
      "options": {
        "A": "Spinous process",
        "B": "Lamina",
        "C": "Pedicle",
        "D": "Facet joint"
      },
      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: C) Pedicle Explanation: In spine fusion surgery , screws are typically inserted into the pedicle of the vertebra. The pedicle is a bony structure that connects the vertebral body to the posterior elements (lamina and spinous processes), making it an ideal anchor point for screws. Pedicle screws provide strong fixation and allow for effective stabilization of the spine during fusion. Incorrect Options: Spinous process (Option A) : The spinous process is the bony protrusion at the back of the vertebra, and it is not used for screw fixation in spine fusion surgery, as it does not provide enough stability. Lamina (Option B) : The lamina is part of the vertebra's posterior structure, but it is not the primary anchor point for screws in fusion surgery. Facet joint (Option D) : Facet joints are involved in the movement between vertebrae, but screws are not typically fixed into the facet joints for spine fusion.

      "explanation": "Correct Answer: A) Cobb’s angle Explanation: The method of measurement of scoliosis given in the image is Cobb’s angle used to measure the degree of deviation and severity. Management of Scoliosis: (depending on Cobb’s angle) Cobb’s angle Management < 20 ° Observation 20-60 ° Bracing (Milwaukee brace) >60 ° Surgical management Various angles in Orthopaedics: Cobb angle (Option A) Scoliosis Bohler angle (Option B) Calcaneum Ferguson angle (Option C) Kyphosis Baumann angle (Option D) Elbow fracture Q angle Patella Kite angle CTEV (Congenital talipus equino varus) Southwick angle SCFE (Slipped capital femoral epiphysis)",

      "question": "A 34-year-old woman comes to the emergency department after a road traffic accident. She was a non-restrained passenger in a car. She has pain in her neck and difficulty in neck movements. She has no associated neurological deficits. A neck collar is applied to protect the spinal cord. An X-ray of the neck is shown in the image below. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?",
      "options": {
        "A": "Hangman fracture",
        "B": "Jefferson's fracture",
        "C": "Clay Shveler fracture",
        "D": "Sciwora"
      },
      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: A) Hangman fracture Explanation: A Hangman fracture occurs due to hyperextension, often from high-impact trauma like a road traffic accident. It involves fractures of the C2 vertebra (axis), leading to anterior displacement. The injury is unstable, but neurological deficits are rare as the fracture can widen the spinal canal. C2 Traumatic Spondylolisthesis (Hangman’s Fracture) Cause : Traditionally from judicial hanging; now more commonly due to hyperextension injuries (e.g., force to the forehead, Forsyth mechanism). Injury : Results in anterior translation at C2, leading to pars fractures and possible C2/3 disc disruption.",
