        "A": "10 mm per day",
        "B": "5 mm per day",
        "C": "1 mm per day",
        "D": "0.1 mm per day"
      },
      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: C) 1 mm per day Explanation : Axon regeneration in the PNS typically occurs at a rate of about 1 mm per day or 1 inch/month under optimal conditions. Causes of nerve injury: Fractures and dislocations Most common cause Uncontrolled diabetes 2nd Most common cause Direct injury Cut, laceration Mechanical injury Compression Radial nerve - Saturday night palsy Axillary nerve - Dislocation of the shoulder Traction Birth injury- Erb’s palsy Ischaemic injury Volkmann’s ischaemia Toxic agents Inj. Tetracycline results in radial nerve palsy. Radiation For cancer treatment Pathogenesis of nerve injury: Nerve degeneration: Part of the neuron distal to the point of injury undergoes secondary or Wallerian degeneration. The proximal part of the injury undergoes primary or retrograde degeneration up to a single node. Nerve regeneration: Begins with the growth of the axonal stump from the proximal segment, which starts to grow distally. If the endoneurial tube (which contains Schwann cells) is intact, the axonal sprout can follow its path to reinnervate the end-organ. The rate of recovery of the axon is approximately 1 mm per day. If the endoneurial tube is interrupted, multiple sprouts (up to 100) may migrate aimlessly into the surrounding tissues (epineurium, perineurium, or adjacent tissues), forming a neuroma . Types of neuromas include: End-neuroma: Formed when the proximal and distal ends of the nerve are widely separated. Neuroma in continuity: Formed when sprouts continue to grow but do not properly reinnervate the distal end. Side-neuroma: Indicates a partial nerve cut, with sprouting forming on one side of the injury. Signs of nerve regeneration The muscle nearest to the injury site recovers first, followed by others in sequence, as the nerve reinnervates muscles from proximal to distal, known as the motor march. Tinel’s sign/ Hoffman’s sign: With progressive regeneration, Tinel sign move distally which indicates axonal regeneration and sensory restoration.",

      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: B) Disruption of the myelin sheath with preserved axon integrity Explanation : The Seddon classification is a system used to categorize peripheral nerve injuries based on the degree of damage to the nerve and its components. Type Description Prognosis Neurapraxia (Grade I) Temporary conduction block, myelin damage only. No neuroma and no degeneration. Recovery is complete within 6 weeks. Axonotmesis (Grade II) Axonal damage, connective tissue intact. Neuroma in continuity. Degeneration: Proximally+distally. Recovery can take up to months Complete recovery may not occur. Motor march present Neurotmesis (Grade III) Complete nerve disruption. End or side neuroma. Degeneration: Proximally+distally. Spontaneous recovery never occurs. Repair is required (poor recovery) Neurapraxia: Definition Physiological disruption of conduction in nerve fibre with temporary loss of motor and sensory function without any structural damage to the nerve. Cause Commonly caused by compression, stretching, or blunt trauma to a nerve, often seen in sports injuries, falls, or prolonged pressure. Mechanism Involves disruption of the myelin sheath surrounding the nerve fibers, which leads to a temporary conduction block while preserving the axon’s structure. Symptoms Temporary numbness, weakness, or tingling in the affected area. Decreased reflexes and muscle strength, but usually not complete paralysis. Diagnosis Based on clinical examination and patient history; electrodiagnostic tests (e.g., nerve conduction studies) may confirm the diagnosis. Classification Classified as a first-degree nerve injury, indicating the least severe type of nerve injury. Prognosis Typically good, with recovery occurring within 6 weeks. Treatment Generally conservative; may include rest, physical therapy, and avoiding activities that could further irritate the nerve.",

Degeneration: Proximally+distally. Spontaneous recovery never occurs. Repair is required (poor recovery) Function maybe adequate but never complete Axonotmesis: A type of nerve injury that involves damage to the axon, but the surrounding connective tissue structures (such as the epineurium, perineurium, and endoneurium) remain intact. Key Features of Axonotmesis: Axonal Damage The axon is disrupted, causing Wallerian degeneration distal to the site of injury. Intact Connective Tissues The epineurium and perineurium remain intact, which facilitates axonal regrowth. Wallerian Degeneration Occurs distal to the injury, involving degeneration of the axon and myelin sheath. Regeneration The nerve has the potential to regenerate because the pathway for axonal growth is preserved, typically at a rate of 1-3 mm per day. Crush Injuries This is a common mechanism leading to axonotmesis, where the nerve is compressed or crushed, causing axonal damage. Motor and Sensory Deficits Loss of motor function and sensation distal to the injury. Absent Reflexes Reflexes in the affected region are typically absent. Conservative Management In most cases, surgical intervention is not necessary. Recovery occurs as the axon regenerates. Physical therapy. Prognosis Good prognosis for recovery since the structural framework of the nerve is preserved, allowing for regrowth and reconnection of the nerve fibers. Recovery can take weeks to months.",

      },
      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Correct answer: C) Neurotmesis Explanation: Neurotmesis is the most severe form of nerve injury, involving complete disruption of both the axon and the surrounding connective tissues. This results in total loss of motor and sensory function distal to the injury, as seen in this patient. The Seddon classification is a system used to categorize peripheral nerve injuries based on the degree of damage to the nerve and its components. Type Description Prognosis Neurapraxia (Grade I) Temporary conduction block, myelin damage only. No neuroma and no degeneration. Recovery is complete within 6 weeks. Axonotmesis (Grade II) Axonal damage, connective tissue intact. Neuroma in continuity. Degeneration: Proximally+distally. Recovery may occur spontaneously or take many months. Complete recovery may not occur Neurotmesis (Grade III) Complete nerve disruption. End or side neuroma. Degeneration: Proximally+distally. Complete recovery never occurs Neurotmesis: The most severe form of nerve injury is characterized by the complete severance of the nerve, including both the axon and the surrounding connective tissues. This results in a total loss of nerve function distal to the site of injury, with both motor and sensory deficits. Key features Complete Disruption: Both the axon and the nerve's supportive structures are completely severed. Loss of Function: This leads to total loss of motor and sensory function in the region supplied by the affected nerve. Wallerian Degeneration: The portion of the axon distal to the injury undergoes Wallerian degeneration, where the axon and myelin sheath break down. Common Causes Severe Trauma: Penetrating injuries such as cuts, gunshot wounds, or severe crush injuries are common causes. Clinical Presentation Complete Motor and Sensory Loss: There is no movement or sensation distal to the injury. Reflexes in the affected area are absent. No Spontaneous Recovery: Unlike less severe nerve injuries, neurotmesis does not allow for spontaneous recovery because the nerve's structural continuity is disrupted. Diagnosis Clinical Examination Electromyography (EMG) and Nerve Conduction Studies (NCS) MRI or ultrasound Treatment Surgical Repair: Nerve ends are surgically reconnected, or nerve grafting is performed to bridge the gap between the severed ends. Tendon transfer procedures are also done. Physical Therapy: Post-surgical therapy is crucial to maintain muscle tone and promote recovery once the nerve starts regenerating. Prognosis Without Surgical Repair: The prognosis is poor, with no chance of functional recovery. With Surgical Repair: Recovery depends on the extent of the injury, the length of time between injury and surgery, and the success of the repair. Even with surgery, full recovery may not be possible, especially in cases of long nerve gaps or severe trauma. Neurapraxia (Option A): Damage is temporary and typically resolves within days to weeks, which is inconsistent with the patient's lack of improvement after several weeks. Axonotmesis (Option B): Involves damage to the axon but the",
