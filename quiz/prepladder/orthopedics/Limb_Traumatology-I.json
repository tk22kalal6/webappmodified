        "D": "Bipartite patella"
      },
      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: A) Patella alta Explanation: An Insall-Salvati ratio greater than 1.2 indicates patella alta, where the patella is positioned higher than normal relative to the femur, which can contribute to knee instability and increased risk of injury. Recurrent Dislocation of the Patella Definition Recurrent lateral displacement of the patella from its normal position. Typically occurs on the lateral side of the knee and refers to patella dislocating multiple times. Recurrent dislocation: 2-3 episodes of patellar dislocation. Habitual dislocation: Occurs with every flexion and extension of the knee. Predisposing Factors: Patella Alta High-riding patella, increasing risk of dislocation due to reduced stability. Patella Baja Low-lying patella, less common but can affect patellar tracking. Tight Lateral Structures Tight iliotibial band or vastus lateralis pulls the patella laterally; commonly seen in conditions like poliomyelitis. Genu Valgum Increased Q angle, leading to greater lateral pressure on the patella. Genu Recurvatum Hyperextension of the knee, increasing instability. Diagnosis: Apprehension Test Lateral pressure on the patella causes discomfort or apprehension, indicating instability. X-ray (Blumensaat's Line) Position of patella relative to Blumensaat's Line assesses patellar Lowermost pole above the line: Patella Alta. Lowermost pole below the line: Patella Baja. Insaal's Line/Salvetti Ratio Ratio between patellar tendon length and patellar >Ratio of 1: Normal. Ratio >1: Suggests Patella Alta. Treatment Options: Modified Campbell’s Operation Lateral release procedure to address tight lateral structures, allowing for central patellar movement. Roux-Goldthwait Procedure Proximal realignment of the knee capsule and quadriceps to stabilize patellar tracking. West and Soto Hall Procedure Imvolves patellectomy (removal of the patella), which is reserved for cases with extensor lag or failure of other treatments. Patella baja (Option B): This condition is characterized by a lower-than-normal position of the patella, indicated by a ratio less than 0.8, making it the opposite of the patella alta. Patellar tendon rupture (Option C): Although a patellar tendon rupture may lead to alterations in patellar position, the Insall-Salvati ratio specifically evaluates patellar height and does not directly diagnose tendon ruptures. Bipartite patella (Option D): This condition involves a patella that has two distinct bony segments due to a developmental anomaly. While it may alter the patellar shape, it is not evaluated through the Insall-Salvati ratio.

Anterior hip dislocation Classification Type I: Pubic (superior) injuries Type II: Obturator (inferior) injuries Management Reduction should be performed as soon as possible under sedation or general anesthesia. Closed reduction technique: Hold the affected leg in external rotation, abduction, and flexion. Apply longitudinal traction. Internally and externally rotate the leg until reduction is achieved, and apply anterior pressure on the femoral head if necessary. If repeated attempts fail, consider an open reduction. Complications Injury to the sciatic nerve. (Option A) Avascular necrosis of the femoral head (Option D) : may require hip replacement if osteoarthritis develops. Osteoarthritis (Option C) : develops years later. Treatment varies from conservative to total hip replacement. Myositis Ossificans : Develops weeks to months post-injury and is characterized by pain and stiffness. Ill-advised vigorous and improper massage following trauma is the most common cause.Treatment includes rest and analgesics. Potential for associated femoral head fractures. Central dislocation of hip Management Apply distal and lateral femoral traction. Traction is maintained for 8-12 weeks.

Thompson and Epstein's classification of posterior dislocation of the hip Type I (Option A) Dislocation with no more than minor chip fractures Type II (Option C) Dislocation with a single large fragment of posterior acetabular wall Type III Dislocation with comminuted fragments of posterior acetabular wall Type IV Dislocation with a fracture through the acetabular floor Type V (Option D) Dislocation with a fracture through the acetabular floor and femoral head (the femoral head fracture is further classified by Pipkin classification) Early Complications Sciatic Nerve Injury Occurs in 10–20% of cases. Nerve function must be tested before reduction. If a new lesion is diagnosed post-reduction, explore the nerve to check for entrapment. Use ankle splinting to prevent equinus deformity if foot drop occurs. Vascular Injury Possible tearing of the superior gluteal artery , leading to profuse bleeding. Perform an arteriogram if suspected; it may require ligation or embolization. Associated Fractured Femoral Shaft Can be missed if not actively sought. Requires clinical and radiographic exclusion of hip injury. Difficulties in closed reduction may necessitate prompt open reduction followed by internal fixation. Late complications Osteonecrosis of the Femoral Head Occurs in up to 20% of cases Increases to over 40% if reduction is delayed beyond 12 hours. X-ray changes may not appear for weeks, but MRI shows changes sooner. Ischemia due to blood supply interruption necessitates early reduction (ideally within 6 hours). Myositis Ossificans Uncommon, likely related to the severity of soft tissue injury. Unreduced Dislocation Closed manipulation often fails after a few weeks, and then an open reduction may be needed. Increased incidence of stiffness and osteonecrosis , potentially requiring reconstructive surgery. Secondary Osteoarthritis Common due to cartilage damage, retained fragments, and osteonecrosis. Difficult to treat in young patients, often managed with arthroplasty in end-stage cases. Recurrent Instability Uncommon but may require stabilization or delayed reconstruction.",

      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: A) Anterior dislocation of hip Explanation: The vascular sign of Narath is positive in conditions where the femoral head fails to support the femoral artery, preventing the pulsations from being accurately felt. In contrast, in anterior dislocation , the pulse is felt very well and hence gives a negative vascular sign of Narath. Normally, the femoral pulse is felt over the mid-inguinal point easily against the femoral head with the patient in a supine position. In certain conditions, the femoral pulse is not felt very well or at all. This could be due to the movement of the vessel down due to the absence of support from the femoral head. When the femoral pulses of both limbs are palpated and compared, and the affected limb shows low or no femoral pulse, it is referred to as a “positive vascular sign of Narath”. A positive vascular sign of Narath is seen in cases where the femoral head may be affected: Fracture of neck of femur (Option B) Posterior dislocation of the hip (Option D) Developmental dysplasia of the hip (Option C) Girdle-Stones excision arthroplasty for TB hip Tom Smith arthritis (osteomyelitis in infants) Reference: John Ebenezer,Textbook of Orthopedics, 5th Edition, Page 479, 890.",

      "explanation": "Correct Answer: D) Pelvic fracture Explanation: Pelvic fractures may occur in the same trauma setting, but they do not typically disrupt Shenton's line, which is more related to the alignment of the hip and femur. Shenton's Line It is an imaginary curved line drawn along the inferior border of the superior pubic ramus and along the medial edge of the femoral neck. A normal line forms a smooth, uninterrupted curve, indicating proper anatomical alignment. Disrupted: Indicates misalignment associated with various pathologies. Conditions Associated with Disruption 1. Fracture of the Neck of the Femur: Common in the elderly due to osteoporosis; femoral head shifts, causing a pronounced disruption. 2. Intertrochanteric Fracture: Fracture between the greater and lesser trochanters may lead to slight disruption of Shenton's line due to misalignment, often less pronounced than neck fractures. 3. Posterior Dislocation of the Hip: Results from high-energy trauma; femoral head displacement causes a clear break in Shenton’s line. 4. Developmental Dysplasia of the Hip (DDH): Affects infants and children; abnormal hip joint development leads to dislocation or subluxation, disrupting Shenton's line on radiographs.",

Complications of fracture neck of femur Non-union Occurs in 30-40% of intra-capsular fractures. Caused by inadequate immobilization and poor blood supply. Clinical features: Pain Inability to bear weight Limb shortening External rotation Positive Trendelenburg test. Treatment: Older patients: Replacement arthroplasty . Younger patients: Neck reconstruction or Pauwel's osteotomy (Option A) . Avascular necrosis Caused due to loss of medullary and capsular blood supply to the femoral head following a fracture. May lead to head collapse and deformation. X-ray changes are not seen until after a few months to 2 years. Diagnosed via MRI. Treatment: Younger patients: options include arthrodesis, bipolar arthroplasty, Meyer’s procedure or total hip replacement, Elderly patients: hemi-replacement arthroplasty (Option B) or total hip replacement if needed. Osteoarthritis Develops years after fracture due to avascular deformation or faulty alignment. Symptoms: Joint pain and stiffness, initially intermittent, then persistent. Treatment: Younger patients: Inter-trochanteric osteotomy (Option C) or arthrodesis. Elderly patients: Total hip replacement. Heel Palm Test: The surgeon grips both heels in their palms while the legs are positioned in abduction and internal rotation. After releasing the internal rotation, the surgeon observes the degree of external rotation in both feet. If the injured side exhibits significantly more external rotation compared to the uninjured side, this indicates that the reduction is likely inadequate. If this maneuver does not achieve satisfactory reduction, the surgeon should proceed to open reduction rather than attempt repeated manipulations with excessive force, which could compromise the blood supply to the femoral head.",

      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: C) Fat embolism Explanation: A total hip replacement poses many complications, of which fat embolism is the most serious. Arthroplasty is a surgical procedure where the refashioning of a joint is done to relieve pain and to retain or restore movement. There are three types of arthroplasties: Excision arthroplasty, Eg: Girdlestone’s excision arthroplasty. Partial replacement, Eg: hemiarthroplasty for an intracapsular hip fracture. Total joint replacement, Eg: total hip replacement. Hemiarthroplasty Total hip replacement Procedure Replacement of the femoral head while leaving the acetabulum intact. Replacement of both the acetabulum and femoral head with artificial components (high-density polyethylene cup and cobalt-chromium alloy head). Indications Fracture of the neck of femur in the elderly. Full non-operative treatment was attempted and failed. Incapacitating arthritis (e.g., rheumatoid arthritis, osteoarthritis). Types of prosthesis and fixation methods Prosthesis: Monopolar : single-piece prosthesis. Bipolar : two-piece prosthesis allowing motion between parts. Modular : assembled from various combinations of stem and head sizes. Fixation methods: Cemented : Prosthesis bonded to the host bone using bone cement. Used in elderly. Uncemented : Press-fit design for natural bonding with host bone. Used in young patients. Cemented : typically for elderly patients with a life expectancy of 10-15 years. Uncemented : generally done for younger patients. Complications Intraoperative fracture Dislocation Periprosthetic fracture Acetabular erosion Leg-length inequality Infection Aseptic loosening Heterotrophic ossification Foot drop Deep vein thrombosis Pulmonary embolism Deep venous thrombosis (DVT) (Option A) Nerve palsies (Rare; M/c affected nerve: Sciatic nerve) Vascular injury Fractures (Can occur during implantation or due to stress concentration later) Dislocation (Option B) : Infection Heterotrophic bone formation (New bone formation around components, reducing joint movement range) Osteotomy Definition Cutting off a bone Indications Correct excessive angulation, bowing, or rotation of long bones. Address mal-alignment of a joint. Allow elongation or shortening of a bone for leg length inequality. Special cases, such as McMurray's osteotomy, for specific purposes.",

Intertrochanteric fractures are generally more stable and have a higher chance of conservative management. Neck of femur fractures usually occur in younger patients following high-energy trauma. Neck of femur fractures are more commonly intracapsular, while intertrochanteric fractures are extracapsular. Intertrochanteric fractures are typically associated with more blood loss compared to neck of femur fractures.",

        "D": "All Correct"
      },
      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: C) Statements 3 and 4 are correct Explanation: Neck of femur fractures are typically intracapsular, occurring within the joint capsule, while intertrochanteric fractures are extracapsular, involving the area between the greater and lesser trochanters of the femur. Intertrochanteric fractures are associated with more blood loss due to the extracapsular location and increased vascularity in that region. Intertrochanteric fractures are generally less stable and often require surgical fixation, while neck of femur fractures, particularly in the elderly, may require hip replacement. (Statement 1) Neck of femur fractures usually occur in older patients due to low-energy trauma like falls, not high-energy trauma. (Statement 2) Neck of femur fractures and intertrochanteric fractures Aspect Neck of Femur Fracture Intertrochanteric Fracture Location Intracapsular (within the joint capsule) Extracapsular (outside the joint capsule) Age Group Typically after 50 years Typically after 60 years Sex Female > Male Male > Female Common Patient Demographics Elderly (low-energy trauma like falls) Elderly (low-energy trauma); rare high-energy trauma in younger patients Mechanism of Injury Trivial, low-energy trauma (osteoporotic) Low-energy trauma in elderly; usually requires significant trauma in younger patients Stability Less stable, especially if displaced Generally unstable due to muscle forces and location Ability to Walk May be possible in impacted fractures Walking is not possible due to the instability External Rotation Deformity Less than 45º More than 45º Shortening Less than 1 inch More than 1 inch Blood Supply Involvement High risk of avascular necrosis (medial circumflex artery disruption) Lower risk of avascular necrosis Blood Loss Less blood loss due to intracapsular location More blood loss due to the involvement of surrounding vascular structures Pain, Severity, and Tenderness Mild to moderate pain localized to the groin/hip region. Tenderness is typically felt in Scarpa’s triangle. Severe pain, more generalized around the hip with marked tenderness over the greater trochanter. Weight-bearing is difficult or impossible. Treatment Options Non-displaced: Internal fixation (e.g., cannulated screws) Displaced: Surgical fixation (hemiarthroplasty, total hip replacement) Almost always requires internal fixation (e.g., dynamic hip screws, intramedullary nails) Complications High risk of nonunion and avascular necrosis Malunion is more common than nonunion",

      "question": "An elderly patient sustained a fall and was diagnosed with a femoral neck fracture. Upon examination, what is the most likely attitude of the affected limb?",
      "options": {
        "A": "Internally rotated with limb lengthening",
        "B": "Externally rotated with limb shortening",
        "C": "Internally rotated with limb shortening",
        "D": "Externally rotated with limb lengthening"
      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: B) Externally rotated with limb shortening. Explanation: In a femoral neck fracture, especially in elderly patients, the classic presentation of the limb includes external rotation and shortening. The external rotation occurs due to the pull of the external rotator muscles, such as the gluteus maximus and the short external rotators, on the distal femoral fragment. Shortening of the limb occurs due to muscle contraction and overriding of the bone fragments, particularly in displaced fractures. Fracture of the Neck of Femur The fracture of the neck of the femur is a significant injury, particularly in the elderly, and is often associated with osteoporosis and trauma. Etiology Low-Energy Trauma Common in elderly with osteoporosis ; simple fall from standing height can cause a fracture. Osteoporosis Age-related bone loss; post-menopausal women at higher risk; fractures occur with minimal trauma. Pathological Fractures Caused by conditions like metastatic bone disease, multiple myeloma, or Paget’s disease; minimal force needed for fracture. Stress Fractures Seen in athletes or military personnel due to repetitive stress. Clinical Presentation Pain Groin pain radiating to medial thigh or knee; sharp pain worsened by movement. Inability to Bear Weight Unable to stand or walk due to pain, less severe in stress fractures. Attitude of affected limb Shortened and externally rotated limb in displaced fractures; limited internal rotation and flexion. Bruising and Swelling Minimal swelling due to deep femoral neck location; sometimes bruising around hip or groin. Diagnosis Imaging X-ray (AP and lateral views) is the primary modality; fractures are classified using the Garden classification. Internally rotated with limb lengthening (Option A): Incorrect because internal rotation is not characteristic of femoral neck fractures. Lengthening of the limb is physiologically unlikely after a fracture. Internally rotated with limb shortening (Option C): Incorrect because internal rotation is more typical of posterior hip dislocation, not a femoral neck fracture. Externally rotated with limb lengthening (Option D): Incorrect because although external rotation may occur, limb lengthening does not happen after a fracture; instead, limb shortening is the hallmark.",

      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: C) Inferior gluteal artery Explanation: The symptoms and examination findings, including hip pain radiating to the groin and thigh, worsened by activity and restricted motion, indicate avascular necrosis of the femoral head , commonly following an intracapsular neck of femur fracture. The inferior gluteal artery primarily supplies the gluteal region and does not contribute significantly to the blood supply of the femoral head. Therefore, it is not typically involved in AVN associated with neck of femur fractures. Blood supply to the femoral head and neck Blood Supply Source Description Retinacular Vessels Major supply, derived from the medial and lateral circumflex femoral arteries (branches of the deep femoral artery). Forms an extensive network along the femoral neck. Intraosseous Cervical Vessels Secondary source, providing additional vascular support through small penetrating vessels along the femoral neck. Artery of Ligamentum Teres Tertiary source, also called the foveolar artery. Supplies the femoral head via the ligamentum teres. Important in younger patients or in cases of trauma. Obturator Artery Provides minor support through its acetabular branch. Primarily supplies the medial thigh muscles but contributes to anastomoses around the hip joint.",

      },
      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "Correct answer: A) Fat Embolism Explanation: The most likely diagnosis is Fat Embolism due to the combination of confusion, petechial rash, tachycardia, tachypnea, and low oxygen saturation following a femur fracture. Fat Embolism Fat embolism is a multi-organ disorder caused by fat globules entering the bloodstream, commonly occurring after high-risk orthopedic injuries, particularly femur fractures. Classic Triad Hypoxia Petechiae Altered mental status Other Symptoms Tachycardia, fever, anemia, thrombocytopenia, pulmonary dysfunction (e.g., tachypnea, respiratory acidosis). Etiology Young adults (20-30 years): Long bone fractures Iatrogenic cause: Occurs after reamed intramedullary (IM) nailing of the femur. Pathogenesis Following injury, fat from bone marrow or platelet agglutination enters injured vessels and travels as emboli, leading to various clinical manifestations. Investigation Chest X-ray: Snowstorm appearance (pathognomonic). PaO I <60 mm Hg. Platelet count <1.5 lakhs. ECG: Prominent S-wave Other lab findings: Anemia, hypocalcemia. CT scan and MRI: Assess severity. Management Respiratory support: Oxygen or ventilator support to restore PaO I . Drug therapy: Steroids: Reduce lung inflammation and improve gas exchange. Heparin: Lipolytic and antiplatelet agent. Low molecular weight dextran: Increases plasma volume. Antibiotics and other supportive care. Definitive fracture treatment: Early fixation to prevent worsening. Pulmonary Embolism (Option B) typically presents with sudden onset dyspnea, chest pain, and tachycardia, but lacks the petechial rash and altered mental status seen in this case. Additionally, the patient's history of femur fracture points more strongly to fat embolism rather than pulmonary embolism. Deep Vein Thrombosis (Option C) typically presents with pain, swelling, and redness in the affected limb, but lacks the petechial rash, altered mental status, and respiratory symptoms seen in fat embolism, making DVT less likely in this case. Pneumothorax (Option D) presents with pleuritic chest pain and absent breath sounds, which differs from the petechial rash and altered mental status seen in fat embolism, especially after femur fractures.",

      },
      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Correct answer: C) REBOA should be performed immediately to control hemorrhage. Explanation: Resuscitative Endovascular Balloon Occlusion of the Aorta (REBOA) is a crucial intervention for controlling life-threatening hemorrhage by occluding the aorta with a balloon catheter in pelvic fracture injury. Complications of Pelvic Fracture: Shock: Hemorrhagic shock from pelvic injury is the most common cause of mortality (30%). Management: Initial Management: Primary survey (ABCDE) and simultaneous resuscitation as per Advanced Trauma Life Support (ATLS) guidelines. Laparotomy: Immediate laparotomy if the patient remains unstable. Preperitoneal Packing (PPP): Used to create a tamponade effect. Resuscitative Endovascular Balloon Occlusion of the Aorta (REBOA): Uses balloon catheter to occlude the aorta in life-threatening hemorrhage. Can be inflated for up to 60 minutes. (Option C) Intermittent inflation helps with resuscitation and reduces reperfusion injury. Surgical Fixation for Unstable Pelvic Fractures: External Fixation: Provides initial stabilization, particularly in hemodynamically unstable patients. (Option A) Pins are placed in the iliac wings or anterior inferior iliac spine. Definitive Repair: Undertaken once the patient is stable. Various techniques include anterior symphyseal plating, ORIF of the ilium, or sacroiliac screw placement depending on the fracture type. Urethral Injuries: More common in males, with the membranous urethra being the most commonly affected site. Rupture can be complete or incomplete, partial or full thickness. Cardinal signs of urethral injury: Blood at the urethral meatus, perineal hematoma, distended bladder. Treatment: Drainage of the bladder via suprapubic cystostomy. Micturating cysto-urethrogram after 6 weeks to assess for urethral stricture, followed by appropriate treatment. (Option D) Bladder Injuries: Extraperitoneal injuries are treated nonoperatively. Intraperitoneal injuries require surgical repair. (Option B) Sigmoid and Rectal Injuries: Intraperitoneal injuries are debrided and primarily repaired if possible. Extraperitoneal rectal injuries are managed with primary repair and diverting colostomy. Vaginal Lacerations: First-degree injuries are treated with gauze packing; second- and third-degree injuries require surgical repair.",
