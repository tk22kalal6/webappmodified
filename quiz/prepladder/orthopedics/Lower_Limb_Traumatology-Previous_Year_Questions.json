Bipartite Patella: Definition A congenital condition where the patella (kneecap) is divided into two separate bone segments. Etiology Failure of ossification centers to fuse during development, resulting in separate bone fragments. Occurs in approximately 1-2% of the population, often bilateral. Anatomy Typically involves the superolateral corner of the patella. Types Based on the location of the secondary ossification centre, Type I: Inferior pole of patella. Type II: Lateral margin. Type III: Superolateral (most common). Symptoms Usually asymptomatic, but can cause anterior knee pain, especially after trauma or repetitive stress. Diagnosis X-ray: Shows the patella with a well-corticated fragment. MRI: Useful for assessing associated soft tissue injury or bone edema if symptomatic. Differential Diagnosis Patellar fracture (differs by smooth, rounded edges in bipartite patella vs sharp edges in fractures). Management Asymptomatic: No treatment required. Symptomatic: Rest, NSAIDs, physical therapy, or in severe cases, surgery (excision of fragment).",

      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "contracture and to measure hip extension. If the patient has a hip flexion contracture, the contralateral knee will rise off the examination table when the hip on the affected side is extended. Thomas Test : Thomas Test is a clinical examination used to assess hip flexion contracture (tightness of the hip flexors), particularly the iliopsoas muscle. It helps detect hip flexor tightness or shortening which may be contributing to lower back or hip pain. The test is especially useful in diagnosing conditions such as iliopsoas syndrome or hip joint stiffness. Steps in Thomas Test: Position the Patient: Flex the Contralateral Hip: Assess the Involved Hip: While the opposite leg is held in flexion, observe the position of the involved leg (the leg lying flat on the table). Evaluate Knee Flexion Positive Thomas Test: The involved leg rises off the table or the knee remains flexed. This suggests hip flexor contracture (tightness of the iliopsoas or other hip flexors), which may limit the ability of the patient to fully extend the hip. Negative Thomas Test: The involved leg remains flat on the table, with little to no knee flexion, indicating that there is no significant hip flexor tightness. Telescopy (Option C) Identifies hip instability by moving the patient's leg in circular motion, observing abnormal hip joint movement, confirmed by visible and palpable greater trochanter displacement. Lasegue test (Option B) Identifies lumbar radiculopathy or sciatica by lifting the patient's straight leg while lying flat, pain indicating nerve root compression. McMurray test (Option D) Assesses knee meniscal tears by bending, twisting, and extending the patient's knee, pain or \"click\" suggests tear.

This patient is an elderly female who fell and is unable to walk, with shortened, externally rotated lower limb which is suggestive of displaced fracture of the neck of the femur. A hemiarthroplasty is the most appropriate option for this patient. It involves replacing the femoral head and neck with a prosthetic implant. This procedure is generally preferred for older patients with displaced femoral neck fractures, which the X-ray image indicates. Internal Fixation with Cancellous Screws (Option A) This option may be suitable for certain types of hip fractures, but it may not be appropriate for displaced femoral neck fractures, which are more common in the elderly.

      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: B) Spondylolisthesis Explanation: Palpable step in the lumbosacral region with x-ray showing forward displacement of vertebra and intervertebral disc narrowing is suggestive of Spondylolisthesis . Spondylolisthesis It refers to the forward displacement of a vertebra over the one beneath it Commonly occurring at the L5-S1 and L4-L5 levels. Spondylolysis refers to a defect in the pars without the vertebra slipping forward . Classification Dysplastic Least common type Caused by congenital anomalies in the upper sacrum or L5 arch, facilitating the slip. Isthmic The most common type Involving a lesion in the pars interarticularis, which can be further divided into three subtypes: Lytic : A fatigue fracture of the pars interarticularis. Intact but elongated : The pars interarticularis remains intact but is elongated. Acute fracture : A recent fracture of the pars interarticularis. The defect causes the anterior half of the vertebra to slip forward while the posterior half remains with the lower vertebra. Degenerative Results from long-term intersegmental instability , where the pars remains intact, but degenerative changes in the facet joints permit forward slipping. Common in older adults, where instability in the posterior facet joints due to osteoarthritis can lead to displacement, occasionally backwards (retrolisthesis). Severe displacement and neurological issues are rare. Traumatic This results from fractures in other parts of the bony structure rather than in the pars interarticularis. Pathological Caused by generalized or localized bone diseases that weaken the vertebral articulations. X-ray Examination for",

      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "syndrome. The next step is to measure the pressure in the anterior compartment if there is suspicion of compartment syndrome. Normal pressure at the leg is < 11 mm of Hg. Calf pressure during walking is 200-300 mm Hg. Pressure in compartment syndrome >40 mmHg. Acute compartment syndrome is caused by ischemia of a closed compartment of the body (most commonly forearm) which leads to increased intra-compartmental pressure. It may be due to a decrease in compartment size or an increase in the volume of the compartment. Prolonged ischemia will lead to myonecrosis stimulating fibrosis resulting in a fibrotic pull of the wrists and fingers. Causes include: Tight bandages and dressings Animal bites Burns Intensive and excessive exercises Muscle hypertrophy Neoplasms Bleeding into a closed compartment (injury to a vessel, congenital or acquired disorder) Injections in the forearm Surgery on the forearm Clinical Features: Initial Symptoms of Compartment Syndrome (Order of appearance) Pain : The earliest symptom , worsened by passive extension of fingers - Stretch pain Pallor : Skin may appear pale due to reduced blood supply. Pulselessness : Diminished or absent radial pulse. Paresthesia : Numbness or tingling due to nerve compression. Paralysis : Weakness or inability to move fingers, indicating nerve ischemia. Management of ACS: 1. Monitor closely for symptoms of compartment syndrome (Severe pain, swelling, numbness, tingling, muscle weakness). 2. Measure Compartment Pressure If pressure is below 20 mm Hg : Conservative management. If pressure is between 20-30 mmHg : Monitor closely for worsening. If pressure is above 30 mm Hg or Delta P is less than 30 mm Hg : Proceed to fasciotomy. 3. Conservative Management (If pressure < 20 mm Hg or borderline) Elevate limb to heart level - helps reduce edema and venous congestion without compromising arterial inflow. Remove tight dressings or splints. Monitor pain, swelling, and sensation. Repeat compartment pressure measurements regularly. Optimize blood pressure and hydration. 4. Monitor for Progression If symptoms worsen or pressure rises above 30 mm Hg: Proceed to fasciotomy. If symptoms improve: Continue conservative measures and monitoring. 5. Fasciotomy (If pressure > 30 mm Hg or worsening clinical signs) : Volar Fasciotomy 6. Post-Fasciotomy Care - Wound care, physical therapy, and monitoring for complications (e.g., scarring or contractures). Duplex imaging (Option A) may be used in suspected vascular injury or deep vein thrombosis cases. Re-apply cast (Option B) further complicates the condition.

Bohler’s stirrup is a device that holds the Steinmann pin and is used to maintain traction. Bohler Braun splint has 3 pulleys and is used to immobilise and support lower limb fractures by maintaining traction. Instrument Images Proximal Femur Nail (PFN) The Proximal Femoral Nail (PFN) is used for closed intramedullary fixation of proximal femoral fractures. It features two proximal openings for a femoral neck lag screw and an anti-rotation screw. Indications include peritrochanteric, intertrochanteric, and subtrochanteric fractures. It is contraindicated for medial femoral neck fractures. Kuntscher Nail Used for internal fixation of femoral fractures. The nail is a hollow tube with a cloverleaf shape for rotational stability. Fixation is based on three-point fixation: at both ends and the isthmus. Each end has an \"eye\" for the extractor hook during removal. Nail size is determined by measuring from the greater trochanter to the lateral knee joint line and subtracting 2 cm. About 2 cm of the nail is left protruding at the trochanter for removal, usually 2 years post-operation. Kirschner wire (K wire) Thin, straight steel wire with a diameter of 1 to 3 mm. Uses include: Internal fixation of small bones. Tension band wiring in patella Applying traction (e.g., through the olecranon). Fixing fractures in children. Used in Ilizarov’s fixation system. Steinmann Pin Stout, straight steel rod with a diameter of 3 to 6 mm. Primarily used for skeletal traction. Common sites for insertion include the upper end of the tibia, the supracondylar region of the femur, and the calcaneum. Bohler’s Stirrup A device used for holding a Steinmann pin and applying traction. Side screws secure the pin in place. Allows for changing the direction of traction without moving the pin inside the bone. Helps avoid loosening of the pin during traction adjustments. Thomas Splint: Primarily for the stabilization and immobilization of fractures in the femur or tibia. It consists of a metal frame that supports the limb, preventing movement and reducing the risk of further injury. Steinmann Pin: It is a large, stainless steel pin used for internal fixation of fractures or to stabilize bones during surgery. Typically inserted percutaneously (through the skin) or during surgery and is used to hold bones in place for proper healing. Denham's Pin: It is used for joint stabilization, often in the hip joint. It is inserted into the bone and can be used for traction or temporary stabilization while healing. Bohler-Braun Splint: Splint used for the immobilization of fractures, especially in the thigh and leg. It is a two-piece splint made of metal and is commonly used for fractures of the femur and tibia.",

      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Ilizarov > Biplanar frame > Uniplanar with double rod > Uniplanar with a single rod. Ilizarov fixator : The Ilizarov fixator is the most stable fixator. It uses a ring-based system with multiple rods and wires that provide a high degree of stability and control over the alignment and position of the bone fragments. The fixator can be adjusted in multiple planes, providing more stability and making it effective for complex fractures like type IIIa compound tibial fractures. Biplanar frame/Ring with a cylindrical rod : This fixator provides stability through its ring configuration, with the added benefit of a cylindrical rod that increases strength. The biplanar design gives good stabilization in two planes, making it more stable than uniplanar designs but less so than the Ilizarov. Uniplanar with double rod : A uniplanar fixator with double rods provides more stability than a single rod because of the additional support, but it only stabilizes in one plane. It's less stable than biplanar or Ilizarov systems due to the reduced number of support structures and limited planes of control. Uniplanar with a single rod : This is the least stable option because it provides minimal support and only in one plane. It’s commonly used for less complex fractures but doesn’t offer the same level of stability needed for more severe fractures like a type IIIa compound tibial fracture.",

Meniscal repair\" data-author=\"\" data-hash=\"12317\" data-license=\"\" data-source=\"\" data-tags=\"May2025\" src=\"https://image.prepladder.com/notes/ePN74UlRFNngCnji5Fok1746601931.png\" /> Meniscal tears are common knee injuries that often require surgical repair. The meniscus is a C-shaped cartilage structure located in the knee joint, providing stability, load distribution, and shock absorption. The meniscus is divided into different zones based on its vascularity and healing potential. The red-white zone , where the vascular and avascular portions of the meniscus meet, has a good healing potential. The red zone is the outermost region of the meniscus and has a good blood supply, allowing for the best healing capacity. The white zone is the innermost region of the meniscus and has a poor blood supply, limiting its healing potential. Repairing a meniscal tear in the red-white zone has the highest likelihood of successful healing due to the presence of a good blood supply. Surgical techniques used for meniscal repair include suturing, meniscal fixation devices, and meniscal transplantation. Postoperative rehabilitation and physical therapy are crucial for optimal recovery and functional outcomes. Reference: Meniscal tear",

      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: A) Anterior dislocation of the hip Explanation: Anterior hip dislocation Classification Type I: Pubic (superior) injuries Type II: Obturator (inferior) injuries Management Reduction should be performed as soon as possible under sedation or general anesthesia. Closed reduction technique: Hold the affected leg in external rotation, abduction, and flexion. Apply longitudinal traction. Internally and externally rotate the leg until reduction is achieved, and apply anterior pressure on the femoral head if necessary. If repeated attempts fail, consider an open reduction. Complications Injury to the sciatic nerve. Avascular necrosis of the femoral head : may require hip replacement if osteoarthritis develops. Osteoarthritis : develops years later. Treatment varies from conservative to total hip replacement. Myositis Ossificans : Develops weeks to months post-injury and is characterized by pain and stiffness. Ill-advised vigorous and improper massage following trauma is the most common cause.Treatment includes rest and analgesics. Potential for associated femoral head fractures. Posterior dislocation of hip (Option B ruled out) Anterior dislocation of hip Central fracture-dislocation of hip Mechanism of injury: Caused by force along the femoral shaft with the hip flexed (e.g., dashboard injury in motor accidents).

This injury is usually associated with falls or trauma but doesn't typically cause the specific positioning of the leg seen in dislocations. A fracture of the femoral neck (Option D) typically presents with shortening , external rotation , and abduction of the leg, but this injury is more commonly seen in elderly patients with osteoporosis, particularly following falls. While there can be external rotation, abduction is more characteristic of a posterior dislocation or intertrochanteric fracture rather than a femoral neck fracture.",

      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: B) Fat embolism Explanation: The most likely diagnosis is Fat Embolism due to the combination of confusion, petechial rash, tachycardia, tachypnea, and low oxygen saturation following a femur fracture. Fat Embolism Fat embolism is a multi-organ disorder caused by fat globules entering the bloodstream, commonly occurring after high-risk orthopedic injuries, particularly femur fractures. Classic Triad Hypoxia Petechiae Altered mental status Other Symptoms Tachycardia, fever, anemia, thrombocytopenia, pulmonary dysfunction (e.g., tachypnea, respiratory acidosis). Etiology Young adults (20-30 years): Long bone fractures Iatrogenic cause: Occurs after intramedullary (IM) nailing of the femur. Pathogenesis Following injury, fat from bone marrow or platelet agglutination enters injured vessels and travels as emboli, leading to various clinical manifestations. Investigation Chest X-ray: Commonly clear lung fields, occasionally Snowstorm appearance is seen (pathognomonic) PaO I <60 mm Hg Platelet count <1.5 lakhs ECG: Prominent S-wave Other lab findings: Anemia, hypocalcemia CT scan and MRI: Assess severity Management Respiratory support: Oxygen or ventilator support to restore PaO I Drug therapy: Steroids: Reduce lung inflammation and improve gas exchange. Heparin: Lipolytic and antiplatelet agent. Low molecular weight dextran: Increases plasma volume. Antibiotics and other supportive care. Definitive fracture treatment: Early fixation to prevent worsening. Incorrect Options: Pulmonary Embolism (Option B): typically presents with sudden onset dyspnea, chest pain, and tachycardia, but lacks the petechial rash and altered mental status seen in this case. Additionally, the patient's history of femur fracture points more strongly to fat embolism rather than pulmonary embolism. ARDS (Option C): typically presents with sudden onset breathlessness associated with hypoxemia and diffuse alveolar infiltrates on x-ray. Occult Pneumothorax (Option D): presents with pleuritic chest pain and absent breath sounds, which differs from the petechial rash and altered mental status seen in fat embolism, especially after femur fractures.",

      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: A) Crystalloids Explanation: In a case of pelvic bone fracture with hypotension, the immediate next step will be to administer crystalloids and stabilise the patient. Management steps to be followed in this patient: Assessment of vital signs and initiation of ATLS protocol - administration of crystalloids. Pelvic binder is applied to reduce bleeding and maintain hemostasis. (Option D) An external fixator is then applied until the patient's hemodynamic status is stable, followed by internal definite fixation once the patient is fit for surgery. Complications and Management of Pelvic fracture: Shock: Hemorrhagic shock from pelvic injury is the most common cause of mortality (30%). Management: Initial Management: Primary survey (ABCDE) and simultaneous resuscitation as per Advanced Trauma Life Support (ATLS) guidelines. (Option A) Laparotomy: Immediate laparotomy if the patient remains unstable. Preperitoneal Packing (PPP): Used to create a tamponade effect. Resuscitative Endovascular Balloon Occlusion of the Aorta (REBOA): Uses balloon catheter to occlude the aorta in life-threatening hemorrhage ; Can be inflated for up to 60 minutes ; Intermittent inflation helps with resuscitation and reduces reperfusion injury. Surgical Fixation for Unstable Pelvic Fractures: External Fixation: Provides initial stabilization, particularly in hemodynamically unstable patients. Pins are placed in the iliac wings or anterior inferior iliac spine. (Option B) Definitive Repair: Undertaken once the patient is stable ; Various techniques include anterior symphyseal plating, ORIF of the ilium, or sacroiliac screw placement depending on the fracture type. (Option C) Urethral Injuries: More common in males, with the membranous urethra being the most commonly affected site. Rupture can be complete or incomplete, partial or full thickness. Cardinal signs of urethral injury: Blood at the urethral meatus, perineal hematoma, distended bladder. Treatment: Drainage of the bladder via suprapubic cystostomy. Micturating cysto-urethrogram after 6 weeks to assess for urethral stricture, followed by appropriate treatment. Bladder Injuries: Extraperitoneal injuries are treated nonoperatively. Intraperitoneal injuries require surgical repair. Sigmoid and Rectal Injuries: Intraperitoneal injuries are debrided and primarily repaired if possible. Extraperitoneal rectal injuries are managed with primary repair and diverting colostomy. Vaginal Lacerations: First-degree injuries are treated with gauze packing; second- and third-degree injuries require surgical repair.",

Tibial tuberosity fracture The lateral X-ray of the knee joint clearly shows a fracture involving the tibial tuberosity , which is the bony prominence on the anterior surface of the tibia just below the patella. This is the insertion site for the patellar tendon , and fractures here are usually seen in adolescents during forceful quadriceps contraction (e.g., jumping sports). Features of Tibial Tuberosity Fracture: Feature Description Location Anterior proximal tibia (tibial tuberosity) Mechanism Forceful contraction of quadriceps (e.g., jumping, kicking) Radiograph finding Fracture through or below the tibial tuberosity Associated conditions May be associated with Osgood-Schlatter disease as a predisposing factor Medial epicondyle of tibia (Option B): Incorrect — the fracture is not located medially; it's clearly anterior and involves the tibial tuberosity. Gerdy's tubercle fracture (Option C): Incorrect — Gerdy's tubercle is lateral, where the iliotibial band inserts . The fracture here is not lateral. Osgood-Schlatter disease (Option D): Incorrect — this is a chronic traction apophysitis , not an acute fracture. It causes pain and swelling , not a well-defined fracture line.",

The CT scan in this case would show the misalignment of the vertebrae, explaining the patient's chronic back pain. This diagnosis is consistent with the clinical presentation and imaging findings. Incorrect Options: Option A - Paget's Disease: Paget’s disease is a chronic bone disorder that can cause enlarged and deformed bones. On imaging, it typically shows thickened cortical bone, enlarged bones with mixed lytic and sclerotic changes, and a characteristic “cotton wool” appearance. This disease usually affects the pelvis, skull, spine, and long bones, but the imaging features would differ from those seen in spondylolisthesis. Option B - Osteoporosis: Osteoporosis leads to decreased bone density and increased fracture risk, especially in the spine, hips, and wrists. CT scans of patients with osteoporosis typically show generalized bone thinning, with possible compression fractures in the vertebrae, but not the characteristic vertebral slippage seen in spondylolisthesis. Option D - Renal Osteodystrophy: This is a bone pathology associated with chronic kidney disease, characterized by alterations in bone morphology. Imaging might show subperiosteal resorption, \"rugger-jersey\" spine, or osteosclerosis, but it would not show the vertebral slippage characteristic of spondylolisthesis.",

The peroneus longus tendon, which helps evert the foot, can also be affected due to the force of the inversion. Incorrect Options: Option A - Tibialis anterior tendon: This tendon primarily functions to dorsiflex and invert the foot. While it plays a role in ankle stability, it is not typically injured in an inversion injury, which stresses the lateral ligaments rather than the anterior structures. Option B - Tibialis posterior tendon: This tendon is responsible for foot inversion and support of the medial arch. Injuries to the tibialis posterior tendon are more associated with overuse or medial stress rather than acute inversion injuries, which typically affect the lateral side of the ankle. Option C - Extensor hallucis longus tendon: This tendon controls the extension of the big toe and assists in dorsiflexion of the foot. It is less commonly injured in inversion sprains, as it is not located in the lateral or medial regions of the ankle that bear the brunt of an inversion force.

Classification of Tibial Plateau Fracture The tibial plateau refers to the proximal tibial surface, which comprises the medial and lateral articular surfaces of the respective tibial condyles. Lateral tibial plateau fractures are the most common. Mechanism of Injury The main mechanism of injury is a varus or valgus force, with or without axial load. Young Adults: Road traffic accidents, leading to split fractures (high ligament injury risk). Elderly: Trivial falls, causing depression or split depression fractures (associated with osteoporosis) (low ligament injury risk). Classification (Schatzker) Type I: Lateral plateau split fracture (young adults). Type II: Lateral plateau split depression (young adults). Type III: Lateral plateau pure depression (elderly). Type IV: Medial plateau fracture. Type V: Bicondylar fracture. Type VI: Dissociation of metaphysis and diaphysis. Clinical Features Knee swelling due to hemarthrosis. Inability to bear weight Reduce range of knee movements Compartment syndrome (earliest sign: stretch pain ). Imaging X-ray: Initial fracture detection. CT with 3D Reconstruction: Gold standard. MRI: To assess ligament injuries. Management Non-surgical: Stable fractures with minimal displacement. Surgical (ORIF): For displaced fractures or significant depression. Ligament reconstruction if needed. Patella sleeve fracture (Options B) This injury generally occurs from direct trauma to the front of the knee or from a fall, and while possible in road traffic accidents, it is less likely in this case where the deformity and mechanism suggest lateral tibial plateau involvement. Depressed skull fracture (Options C) Typically caused by small objects impacting the skull at high velocity. Cervical fracture (Options D) do not involve fracture of both tibia and fibula.",

The patient lies supine, and one hip is maximally flexed to flatten the lumbar spine and stabilize the pelvis. If the opposite leg lifts off the table (instead of staying flat), it indicates a flexion contracture of the contralateral hip. It is commonly used in elderly patients or individuals with hip arthritis or postural abnormalities. Thomas test is the most appropriate and specific clinical test to diagnose hip flexion contracture . Allen’s test (Option A): Is used to assess arterial blood flow to the hand, especially the patency of the radial and ulnar arteries before arterial blood gas sampling or cannulation. Not related to hip joint pathology. Trendelenburg test (Option B): Assesses the integrity of the hip abductor muscles , particularly the gluteus medius and minimus. A positive test indicates weakness or instability in these muscles (e.g., due to superior gluteal nerve injury), not a flexion contracture. Ober test (Option D): Used to detect iliotibial band (IT band) tightness or contracture. The patient lies on the unaffected side, and the examiner extends and abducts the affected leg, then allows it to drop. If it remains elevated, it suggests IT band tightness.

      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "The MCFA is a branch of the deep femoral artery and provides the primary blood supply to the femoral head. Disruption or occlusion of this artery can lead to compromised blood flow to the femoral head, resulting in avascular necrosis. The diagnosis and management of avascular necrosis of the femoral head typically involve a combination of clinical evaluation, imaging studies (such as X-rays, MRI, or bone scans), and treatment options ranging from conservative measures to surgical interventions, depending on the severity and stage of the condition. Incorrect Options: Option B - Lateral Circumflex Femoral Artery (LCFA): The LCFA is also a branch of the deep femoral artery, but it primarily supplies blood to the muscles around the hip joint and does not directly supply the femoral head. Option C - Obturator Artery: The obturator artery primarily supplies blood to the muscles of the medial thigh and does not directly supply the femoral head.

      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "helps stabilize the knee against excessive sideways or valgus stress. It connects the femur (thigh bone) to the tibia (shin bone) and plays a crucial role in maintaining the integrity of the knee joint. When the knee undergoes a forceful impact from the outer side, such as a blow to the outer knee during sports like football, it can result in a valgus stress on the knee. This valgus force can cause the MCL to stretch or tear, resulting in an MCL injury. Incorrect options: Option A. Anterior cruciate ligament (ACL): While the ACL is another important ligament in the knee, it is not directly associated with MCL injuries. The ACL is located inside the knee joint and is responsible for controlling rotational and anterior translation of the tibia in relation to the femur. Option C . Posterior cruciate ligament (PCL): The PCL is also an internal ligament of the knee, but it is not commonly associated with MCL injuries. The PCL helps stabilize the knee against posterior translation of the tibia in relation to the femur. Option D . Lateral meniscus: The lateral meniscus is the counterpart of the medial meniscus and is located on the outer side of the knee joint. It is not directly associated with MCL injuries. However, it can be injured independently or in conjunction with other knee injuries. Reference: .",

Inter-trochanteric fractures generally have a lower risk of non-union compared to fractures of the neck of the femur. Option B - 1, 2, 3 are correct: Statement 2: One-year mortality rate is about 20 to 30% - This statement is incorrect. The one-year mortality rate for inter-trochanteric fractures is typically lower than 20-30%. Option D - 1, 2, 3, 4 are correct: The correct option is C: 2 and 4 are correct. The statements regarding the one-year mortality rate and the ability to reduce mortality by operating within 48 hours are accurate, while the statements about the gender distribution and association with non-union are incorrect.
