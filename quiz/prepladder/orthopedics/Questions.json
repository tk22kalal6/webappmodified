      "explanation": "articular surface of the hip joint. In this stage, true shortening of the leg occurs due to the destruction and deformity of the joint structure. Babulkar and Pandey Clinico-Radiological Classification Stage Clinical Findings X-ray findings Stage I: Synovitis (Option A) Irritable hip Increased FABER (Flexion, Abduction, External Rotation) Apparent lengthening due to FABER (Position of ease due to synovitis) Terminal movements are restricted by 25% Normal or haziness of the articular margins Stage II: Early Arthritis (Option B) Early joint pain, stiffness Increased FADIR (Flexion, Adduction, Internal Rotation) Apparent shortening due to FADIR Gluteal and Quadriceps muscle wasting ROM restricted by 50% Osteopenia and narrowing of joint space Stage III: Late Arthritis (Option C) Marked FADIR True shortening Gross restriction of movements (usually >50%) Marked subchondral erosion and destruction Stage IV: Pathological Dislocation/severe arthritis (Option D ) Marked FADIR Gross shortening Severe destruction and loss of joint space \"Wandering/traveling Acetabulum\": Pathological dislocation/subluxation due to gross destruction of the femoral head or the superior acetabular margin.

      "explanation": "Correct Answer: A) Reduction of joint space Explanation : Joint space reduction is the characteristic finding in TB knee. T.B. of Knee Joint: Third common site of skeletal TB infection The initial lesion formation is seen in Synovium (Last in Hip joint) Stages: Synovitis:Boggy swelling and pain Early Arthritis Late Arthritis or Pathological dislocation: Triple deformity Flexion of knee: It is due to Hamstring spasm Posterior subluxation of tibia: Due to Laxity of capsule Lateral shift of tibia: Due to spasm of ilio-tibial band External rotation of tibia: Due to spasm of ilio-tibial band Treatment: ATT (2HRZS + 7HR) Traction For early arthritis, along with ATT, Synovectomy and Joint debridement/Joint clearance can opt. For pathological dislocation: ATT Arthrodesis (fusing of joint) Total knee replacement Reference: TB knee",

      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "disease of the knee, is a form of extrapulmonary tuberculosis that affects the knee joint. In this condition, the tuberculosis bacteria infect the synovial lining of the knee joint, leading to inflammation, destruction of joint structures, and subsequent reduction of the joint space. Incorrect options: Option B. Increase in joint space: Tuberculosis of the knee typically leads to destruction and narrowing of the joint space rather than an increase. This is due to the destructive nature of the infection, which can erode the articular cartilage and other joint structures. Option C . Degeneration of cartilage: While the destruction of joint structures, including cartilage, is a characteristic feature of tuberculosis of the knee, it does not manifest as degeneration in the sense of wear-and-tear or age-related changes. Rather, it is the result of the direct effects of the tuberculosis infection on the joint. Option D. none of the above this option is incorrect",

      "question": "Assertion: As Pott's spine progresses and causes neurological difficulties, decompression surgery becomes necessary. Why: Neurological abnormalities may persist even after completion of ATT. E. Both assertion and reason are false",
      "options": {
        "A": "Both assertion and reason are true and the reason is the correct explanation for the assertion",
        "B": "Both assertion and reason are true, but the reason is not the correct explanation for the assertion",
        "C": "Assertion is true, but the reason is false",
        "D": "Assertion is false, but the reason is false"
      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "for the assertion in Pott's spine. This means that when there is a progressive neurological impairment in Pott's spine (spinal tuberculosis), decompression surgery is necessary. Reason: Even after completion of ATT (anti-tuberculosis treatment), there can be neurological abnormalities. This statement is true, as some patients may still experience residual neurological deficits even after completing the anti-tuberculosis treatment. Incorrect options: Option A: This option states that both the assertion and reason are true, and the reason is the correct explanation for the assertion. However, as explained earlier, the reason is not the correct explanation for the assertion. Option C: This option states that the assertion is true, but the reason is false. However, both the assertion and reason are true, so this option is incorrect. Option D: This option states that the assertion is false, but the reason is false. However, the assertion is true, so this option is incorrect. Option E: This option states that both the assertion and reason are false. However, as explained earlier, both the assertion and reason are true, so this option is incorrect.",
