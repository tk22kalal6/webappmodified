      "question": "A 28-year-old intravenous drug abuser presents with a history of pain, fever, cough with blood in sputum, night sweats, weight loss, and swelling in his right hip joint. A cold abscess is suspected near the joint upon further examination and investigations. Which of the following is characteristic of this condition?",
      "options": {
        "A": "Rapid destruction of cartilage by proteolytic enzymes",
        "B": "Rarely involves the ends of long bones",
        "C": "Always causes more significant systemic symptoms",
        "D": "Spreads through the hematogenous route"
      },
      "correct_answer": "D",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: D) Spreads through the hematogenous route Explanation: The patient in this scenario is most probably having Tuberculous arthritis with the primary focus being pulmonary TB. Tuberculous arthritis typically occurs due to the hematogenous spread of Mycobacterium tuberculosis bacteria from a primary focus, most commonly the lungs. Etiology of Tuberculosis of bone and joints: Most common causative organism: Mycobacterium tuberculosis. Sometimes the causative organism is bovine , it spreads through raw milk and is less common in India. Predisposing conditions: Chronic debilitating disorders, diabetes, drug abuse, prolonged corticosteroid medication, AIDS, and conditions with reduced defense mechanisms. Pathogenesis: Bone and joint tuberculosis are always secondary to the primary focus in the lungs, lymph nodes, and other sites. Mode of spread from the primary focus: Haematogenous or direct extension from a neighboring focus. The sequence in which bone and joint tuberculosis affects different areas: Spine > hip > knee > elbow. Most commonly involves the ends of the long bone. Epiphyseal cartilage is not a barrier to invasion. Therefore, the infection reaches the joint sooner. (Option B) Infection persists as chronic osteomyelitis only in the vertebral bodies, and the greater trochanter of the femur. The natural course of the disease: Inflammation stage: It causes local bone necrosis, caseation, and demineralization due to hyperemia. Without resistance or treatment, bone cortices erode, leading to sub-periosteal abscesses. Cold abscesses may form and burst, creating sinuses. Pathological fractures can occur in affected bones. Joints: Develop low-grade synovitis, with thickened synovial membranes. Unlike pyogenic arthritis where proteolytic enzymes cause severe early destruction of the articular cartilage, tubercular infection causes slow destruction. Once the synovium is inflamed, it starts destroying the cartilage from the periphery. (Option A) This inflammatory synovium at the periphery of the cartilage is called Pannus. The joint fills with pus, causing lax ligaments and subluxation. Pus and debris may cause cold abscesses and chronic sinuses. Types of tubercular infection pathology: Proliferative response (common): Characterized by chronic granulomatous inflammation with a lot of fibrosis. Exudative response: Extensive caseation necrosis without much cellular reaction. This results in extensive pus formation. Healing stage: Heals by fibrosis, often leading to fibrous ankylosis, with bony ankylosis",

      "question": "A 14-year-old girl presents to the orthopedic OPD with a four-month history of left knee pain, which worsens with activity and at night. She has had episodes of low-grade fever and fatigue but denies any recent trauma. Upon physical examination, the left knee has limited range of motion and noticeable soft-tissue swelling. An image of the X-ray of the left knee joint is shown below. What is Phemister’s triad, and how does it relate to this case?",
      "options": {

      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: B) A triad of radiological findings indicating tuberculous arthritis Explanation: Phemister’s triad of juxta-articular osteopenia/osteoporosis, peripheral osseous erosions, and joint space narrowing suggests tuberculous arthritis but is nonspecific. X-ray findings: Characteristic signs are soft-tissue swelling and periarticular osteoporosis. Bone ends appear ‘washed-out, ’ and the articular space narrows. In children, epiphyses",

      "question": "A 32-year-old woman with right hip drug-susceptible TB has been treated with first-line anti-tubercular drugs (HRZE) for two months. She no longer has fever, and night sweats. What is the next step in the management of this patient?",
      "options": {
        "A": "Discontinue therapy if symptoms have improved",
        "B": "Transition to second-line drugs",
        "C": "Continue Isoniazid and Rifampicin for four months",
        "D": "Start surgical intervention"
      },
      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: C) Continue Isoniazid and Rifampicin for four months Explanation: The standard treatment regimen for drug-susceptible skeletal TB involves an intensive phase of four drugs (Isoniazid, Rifampicin, Pyrazinamide, and Ethambutol) for two months, followed by a continuation phase of Isoniazid and Rifampicin for at least four more months (totaling six months of therapy). Since the patient is showing improvement, the next step is to transition to the continuation phase with Isoniazid and Rifampicin for the remaining four months. Medical treatment of Skeletal T.B: 1st line therapy (HRZES) Drug name Mechanism of action Dosage Complications/Side effects Isoniazid (INH) (H) Bacteriostatic It inhibits cell wall synthesis. 5 mg/kg/day Hepatotoxicity Peripheral neuritis Rifampicin (R) Bactericidal 10 mg/kg/day Hepatotoxicity Red coloured urine Pyrazinamide (Z) Bactericidal 25 mg/kg/day Hepatotoxicity Ethambutol (E) Bacteriostatic 15 mg/kg/day Optic neuritis Colour blindness Streptomycin (S) Bactericidal 15 mg/kg/day Vestibular damage Nephrotoxicity Circumoral paraesthesia 2nd line therapy Drug name Mechanism of action Dosage Complications/Side effects Para amino salicylic acid (PAS) Bacteriostatic 10 gm/day Anorexia, Nausea, Vomiting Ethionamide Bacteriostatic 15 mg/kg/day Anorexia, Nausea, Vomiting Cycloserine Bacteriostatic 1 gm/day CNS toxicity- Headache, Tremor, Dysarthria. Regimen: Musculoskeletal TB falls under category I of the WHO treatment category Category I treatment: 2 months of HRZE followed by 4 months of HR (Option A) Transition to second-line drugs (Option B): Second-line drugs are reserved for cases of drug-resistant TB or when patients are intolerant to first-line therapy. There is no indication of drug resistance or adverse effects in this patient. Therefore, switching to second-line drugs is unnecessary and would increase the risk of side effects. This option is also incorrect. Start surgical intervention (Option D): Surgery is not the first line of management for skeletal TB unless there is severe joint destruction, neurological complications, or failure to respond to medical therapy. In this case, the patient is responding well to medication, so surgical intervention is not indicated at this stage. This option is incorrect.

      "question": "A 40-year-old man presents with a three-month history of progressively worsening lower back pain, night sweats, and weight loss. There is no history of trauma. On spinal examination, there is significant tenderness over the thoracolumbar spine, gibbus with limited range of motion. Imaging reveals vertebral destruction and a paravertebral cold abscess. Blood tests show an elevated ESR and CRP. Which of the following factors makes the vertebral body particularly susceptible to the spread of tuberculosis bacteria?",
      "options": {
        "A": "Via the lymphatic vessels surrounding the spine",
        "B": "Through the Batson's paravertebral venous plexus",
        "C": "By direct extension from the intervertebral discs",
        "D": "Through direct pulmonary tuberculosis."
      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: B) Through the Batson's paravertebral venous plexus Explanation: The vertebral body is more susceptible due to the blood supply of the spine. Embryologically: The lower half of the upper vertebrae, intervertebral disc, and upper half of the lower vertebrae have a common origin from a sclerotome which has its own blood supply, making this area susceptible to tuberculosis bacteria infection via a hematogenous route through Batson's venous plexus. Spinal Tuberculosis: Also known as Pott's Spine. The most common site of skeletal TB is the Spine. In the spine, the thoracolumbar region is mostly affected. Pathology: TB of the spine is always secondary. The bacteria reach the spine via the hematogenous route from the primary focus. (Option A) It spreads via the para-vertebral plexus of veins i.e., Batson's plexus, which has free communication with the visceral plexus of the abdomen. Batson's paravertebral venous plexus (Internal vertebral venous plexus) is a valveless plexus that spreads infection to the vertebral body. Rich vascular plexus in the subchondral region of each vertebrae makes it easier for TB bacteria to spread to the paradisiacal area. Granulomatous inflammation erodes the vertebral margins. This leads to disc degeneration and eventual destruction. Weakening of vertebral trabeculae causes vertebral collapse. Healing: Lytic areas in the bone are replaced by new bone. The adjacent vertebrae undergo fusion by bony bridges, which are permanent. Clinical manifestations: The usual clinical symptom is a painful stiff back, and radicular pain if the nerve root is compressed. By direct extension from the intervertebral discs (Option C): Intervertebral discs can be affected by TB, but the infection typically spreads to the vertebral body first via blood vessels, not directly from the discs. Through direct pulmonary tuberculosis (Option D): Tuberculosis often originates in the lungs and can spread to the spine, but this option is less specific regarding the route of spread to the vertebral body. The hematogenous spread via Batson's plexus is a more direct explanation for how the infection seeds in the vertebral body. This option is incorrect. Systemic symptoms like loss of appetite, and fever may or may not be present. Cold abscess: Pus and tubercular debris from a diseased vertebra. Called \"cold\" due to lack of typical inflammation signs (heat, redness). Pus can spread in any direction from the affected vertebra. Classical night cries. Early deformity to occur is loss of normal cervical and lumbar lordosis (due to paraspinal muscle spasm). GIBBUS is commonly seen in the thoracic spine TB. Paraplegia.",

        "B": "MRI",
        "C": "CT scan",
        "D": "Ultrasound"
      },
      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: C) CT scan Explanation: A CT scan is the most preferred imaging modality for the assessment of destruction of the vertebral body and sequestrum formation. They can clearly show the extent of bony changes. X-ray: Reduction of disc space- Lateral X-ray is better for the evaluation of disc space. (Option A) In the early stages- wedging of the vertebrae. In late stages- angular kyphotic deformity . Evidence of cold abscess: Bird nest appearance of cold abscess of the thoracic region showing typical fusiform shape. Rarefaction: There is diffuse rarefaction of the vertebrae above and below the lesion. Types of lesions in the vertebral column are: Paradiscal (most common) Central Anterior Posterior ( pedicle, lamina, spinous process, and transverse process) Signs of healing: Sclerosis Sclerotic bone Bony fusion Image: AP and Lateral view of Lumbosacral spine with diminished intervertebral disc space and erosion of inferior and superior end plate of L4-L5vertebra. CT scan: (Option C) The most preferred imaging modality for the assessment of destruction of the vertebral body and sequestrum formation. The pattern of bone damage, including fragmentary, osteolytic, sclerotic, and subperiosteal changes, is clearly visible on CT scans. MRI: (Option B) Investigation of choice to evaluate the type and extent of compression of the cord. IOC for potts spine and potts paraplegia. But doesn't help to visualize bony vertebral destruction. Earlier signs, spinal nerve root, and paraspinal soft tissue are better visualized. The best diagnostic modality for spinal TB. Ultrasound (Option D): It can be used to assess soft tissue structures, fluid collections, and ultrasound-guided needle aspiration or biopsy for early histopathological diagnosis, but is not commonly utilized for evaluating bony structures or deep vertebral lesions. Therefore, it is not suitable for assessing vertebral body destruction in Pott’s spine.",
