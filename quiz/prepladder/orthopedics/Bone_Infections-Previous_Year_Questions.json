      "explanation": "lesions. Paradiscal involvement, the most common pattern, begins at the intervertebral disc, spreading to adjacent vertebrae, potentially causing neurological deficits. Thoraco-lumbar region (D12, L1) is mostly affected , typically in the first three decades of life. Manifestations include bone destruction, cold abscess, and Pott's paraplegia. Spinal TB is usually secondary to pulmonary TB via hematogenous spread. Hematogenous spread occurs through arterial or venous routes, facilitated by subchondral arterial arcade and Batson's venous plexus. Clinical manifestations include a stiff, painful back, rare systemic symptoms, and classical night cries. Deformities include loss of lordosis, followed by gibbus formation, primarily in the thoracic spine. Paraplegia tends to be spastic, especially in the thoracic spine. Imaging modalities include X-ray (loss of plate margins, radiolucency), CT scan (preferred for degeneration assessment), and MRI (best for early diagnosis) Reference: Apley and Solomon’s System of Orthopaedics and Trauma, 10th Edition, Page 507, 508.",

        "C": "Pin tract infections",

      },
      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: C) Pin tract infections Explanation: Ring sequestrum is a type of sequestrum commonly seen in pin tract infections . These infections occur at the site where pins or wires from an external fixator penetrate the skin and bone. The infection can cause the bone to form a \"ring-like\" sequestrum around the pin, which is a hallmark of pin tract infections. Types of Sequestrum Type Disease Tubular Pyogenic Ring External Fixator (Pin tract infections) Black Actinomycosis Coralliform Perthe’s Disease Coke Tuberculosis Sandy Tuberculosis Feathery/ Ivory Syphilis Coke sequestrum Ring sequestrum Tubular sequestrum Incorrect Options: Fungal infections (Option A) can cause bone involvement (e.g., osteomyelitis), but they typically do not produce a \"ring sequestrum\" on X-ray. The sequestrum in fungal infections tends to be more irregular and less characteristic than the ring-shaped sequestrum seen in pin tract infections. Septic arthritis (Option B) is an infection of the joint, not directly involving the bone. While septic arthritis can lead to secondary bone involvement and osteomyelitis (infection of the bone), it is not typically associated with the formation of a \"ring sequestrum\". Acute osteomyelitis (Option D) involves a bone infection, usually caused by bacteria, but it typically results in an irregular or amorphous sequestrum. Acute osteomyelitis usually presents with widespread bone destruction, rather than the isolated, ring-shaped sequestrum seen in pin tract infections.",

      "question": "A 12-year-old boy presents with a gradually progressing swelling and dull aching pain since 6 months in his lower leg .He is otherwise healthy. The radiographic image of his leg is shown below. The most likely diagnosis is:",

      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "caused by Staphylococcus aureus infection. It often presents with localized pain and swelling. Radiographic findings may reveal a well-defined lytic lesion with a sclerotic border. In children Brodie's abscess is most common in the metaphyseal area. Occurs before epiphyseal closure in a child. In adults - more common in epiphysio-metaphyseal junction Occurs after epiphyseal closure in adults. Most common sites - upper tibia, lower femur. Most common organism - Staphylococcus aureus. Most common age - 2nd decade. Pathophysiology - Low virulence of the organism and good host resistance leads to confirming the infection. Cavity is formed. On aspiration sterile pus is seen - due to good host resistance. Incorrect Options: Option A - Osteosarcoma: Osteosarcoma is a type of malignant bone tumor that commonly affects children and adolescents. It typically presents with pain and swelling, often in the long bones, such as the tibia. Radiographic features may include bone destruction, irregular bone formation, and sunburst appearance. Option B - Osteoblastoma: Osteoblastoma is a rare benign bone tumor that can cause pain and swelling. It commonly affects the spine and long bones. Radiographic",

      "options": {
        "A": "Osteogenic sarcoma",
        "B": "Ewing's sarcoma",
        "C": "Chronic osteomyelitis",

      },
      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "persists for an extended period, typically more than six weeks. The infection leads to inflammation, bone destruction, and the formation of dead bone fragments called sequestrum. The X-ray image showing sequestrum and involucrum supports the diagnosis of chronic osteomyelitis. In chronic osteomyelitis, sequestrum refers to the dead bone fragments or necrotic tissue that can be seen as areas of radiolucency on the X-ray. Involucrum, on the other hand, refers to new bone formation surrounding the sequestrum, which appears as a dense, irregularly shaped area on the X-ray. Incorrect Options: Option A - Osteogenic Sarcoma: Osteogenic sarcoma is a malignant bone tumor that arises from bone-forming cells ,the X-ray findings of sequestrum and involucrum are not typical for osteosarcoma. Option B - Ewing's Sarcoma: Ewing's sarcoma is malignant bone tumor that often affects children and young adults. It typically presents with a characteristic onion-skin appearance on imaging. The X-ray findings of sequestrum and involucrum are not consistent with Ewing's sarcoma. Option D - Multiple Myeloma: Multiple myeloma is a malignancy of plasma cells that primarily affects the bone marrow. the X-ray findings of sequestrum and involucrum are not typically associated with multiple myeloma.

      "question": "What is the characteristic sign of a simple bone cyst?",
      "options": {
        "A": "Fallen fragment sign",
        "B": "Scalloping of cortex",
        "C": "Never breaches physis",
        "D": "Central radiolucent lesion"
      },
      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "seen in simple bone cysts. It appears as a detached and fallen fragment of bone within the cystic cavity. This sign is considered pathognomonic, meaning it is unique to simple bone cysts and strongly indicative of their presence. Incorrect Options: Option B - Scalloping of Cortex: Scalloping of the cortex can be observed in various bone lesions, including tumors and cysts. It refers to a concave deformity or erosion of the bone cortex adjacent to the lesion. While scalloping can be seen in simple bone cysts, it is not pathognomonic and can also occur in other conditions. Option C - Never Breaches Physis: The physis, or growth plate, is a cartilaginous region at the ends of long bones responsible for bone growth. Simple bone cysts can extend across the physis, breaching its boundaries and causing disruption. Therefore, the statement that simple bone cysts never breach the physis is incorrect. Option D- Central Radiolucent Lesion: While simple bone cysts typically appear as central radiolucent lesions on imaging studies, this finding is not specific to simple bone cysts alone. Other bone lesions, such as aneurysmal bone cysts or giant cell tumors, can also present as central radiolucent lesions. Thus, it is not a pathognomonic sign for simple bone cysts.
