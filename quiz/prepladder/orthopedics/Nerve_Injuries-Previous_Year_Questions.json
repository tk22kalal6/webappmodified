Clawing is seen in 2 medial fingers only. Seen in pure ulnar nerve injury . Also known as the true claw hand. Complete claw hand: Clawing of all 4 fingers. Seen in combined median + ulnar nerve palsy Tardy ulnar nerve palsy: Slow-onset (over years) ulnar nerve palsy. Seen with cubitus valgus deformity seen in lateral epicondyle humerus fracture. Other deformities: Wasting of hypothenar muscles & intrinsic muscles of the hand. Hollow inter-metacarpal spaces in hand. Ulnar paradox: The higher the lesion, the less severe the deformity. Reason: Long finger flexors are paralyzed and loss of finger flexion makes the deformity less obvious. Treatment of Ulnar claw hand: Static procedure (removal) Zancolli",

The symptoms improve when the patient hangs their arms from the bed. Which of the following choices accurately identifies the patient's condition and the test employed to evaluate it?",

        "D": "Carpal tunnel syndrome, Durkan's test"
      },
      "correct_answer": "D",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: D) Carpal tunnel syndrome, Durkan's test Explanation: Tingling and numbness of fingers, with symptoms worsening at night is suggestive of Carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS) . The most reliable clinical test to diagnose CTS is the Durkan test . Carpal tunnel syndrome: Definition Compression of the median nerve as it passes through the carpal tunnel in the wrist Symptoms Numbness, tingling in thumb, index, and middle fingers Pain in hand and wrist, Weakness in grip Symptoms often worse at night and improve during the day. Advanced cases may lead to hand weakness, clumsiness, and muscle atrophy. Structures Affected Median Nerve : Compressed within the carpal tunnel, leading to symptoms and signs. Flexor Tendons : The nine flexor tendons passing through the carpal tunnel can become inflamed, further compressing the median nerve. Structures Spared Thenar Eminence : Sensory loss generally spares this area because its nerve (palmar sensory cutaneous nerve) bypasses the carpal tunnel. Clinical Signs Weakness: Notable weakness in thumb abduction and opposition. Atrophy : Possible atrophy of the thenar eminence in advanced cases. Sensory Loss : Loss typically affects the median nerve distribution (thumb, index, middle, and radial half of the fourth digit). Causes Idiopathic- commonest cause Inflammatory causes- Rheumatoid arthritis, wrist osteoarthritis Post-traumatic causes- Bone thickening after a Colles' fracture Endocrine causes- Myxoedema, Acromegaly Diagnostic Tests Nerve Conduction Studies (NCS) - primary diagnostic test Electromyography (EMG) Phalen Test: Positive if pain/paresthesias arise during wrist flexion. Tinel Test: Positive if tapping over the carpal tunnel elicits symptoms. Durkan test: Direct compression on Median nerve for 30 seconds. More specific than the Phalen/Tinel test. Treatment Conservative: Wrist splinting, NSAIDs, activity modification Corticosteroid injections Surgical: Carpal tunnel release (for severe or refractory cases) Guyon’s canal syndrome and Froment’s test (Option A): Refers to involvement of the Ulnar side of the wrist leading to compression of Ulnar nerve. Froment’s test: Used to test adductor pollicis muscle (supplied by Ulnar nerve).",

The two conditions where a wrist splint is indicated are carpal tunnel syndrome and osteoarthritis (OA) . Knuckle bender splint (Option C): This splint is used to flex metacarpophalangeal (MCP) in cases of Ulnar nerve injury . Dynamic finger splint (Option D): This splint is spring loaded and is used to provide stretch to those joints with reduced range of motion due to immobilization.

TOS is a condition characterized by the compression or irritation of the neurovascular structures in the thoracic outlet, which can lead to symptoms such as numbness, tingling, and weakness in the upper extremities. During the Roos test, the patient is asked to actively elevate both arms to 90 degrees, flex the elbows to 90 degrees, and open and close their hands for approximately three minutes. If the patient experiences symptoms, such as numbness, tingling, or the inability to maintain the position due to pain or weakness, it may indicate a positive Roos test, suggesting the presence of TOS. Incorrect Options: Option A - Adson's Test: Adson's test is another test used to evaluate TOS. It involves checking the radial pulse while the patient rotates their head and extends their neck. This test is not demonstrated in the scenario. Option B - Pemberton Test: The Pemberton test is used to assess for thoracic outlet syndrome caused by the compression of structures between the clavicle and the first rib. It involves raising both arms above the head (180 degrees anterior flexion at the shoulder) while monitoring for symptoms. Unlike the Roos test, it does not involve pumping the fists.
