      "explanation": "Prevents foot drop. Applies traction in the line of the femur. Traction in the supracondylar area of the femur. Traction in the line of the leg. Indications: Comminuted trochanteric fractures of the femur. Fracture shaft of the femur & supracondylar fractures. Occasionally used for tibial and fibular fractures. Precaution: Support should be given at the fracture site, not the knee joint to prevent angulation (especially in supracondylar fractures). Problems: Difficult nursing care. Heavy and cumbersome. Risk of recumbent complications (bedsores, pneumonia, renal calculi). Thomas splint (Option B): Used primarily for femoral shaft fractures. Features a ring at the proximal end to support the thigh. Volkmann splint (Option C): Used for forearm fractures and immobilization of the wrist/elbow. Prevents contractures (e.g., Volkmannâ€™s ischemic contracture). Cramer wire (Option D): A malleable metal splint used for temporary immobilization of fractures. Shaped according to limb contours.",
