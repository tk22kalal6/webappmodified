      "explanation": "Correct Answer: D) Sunburst appearance in long bones Explanation: The clinical presentation and investigation findings are highly suggestive of multiple myeloma. All of the options except sunburst appearance are typical radiological features in a case of multiple myeloma. Sunburst appearance in long bones is characteristic of osteosarcoma. Multiple myeloma: It is the most common primary malignant bone tumor. It is the malignant proliferation of plasma cells of the B-cell lineage within the bone marrow. Common age group: Around 70 years of age. Men > Female. Pathology: Increased production of plasma paraprotein and immunoglobulin. Tumor tissue replaces the bone and there is no reactive bone formation. Histopathology: Bone marrow is hypercellular and diffusely infiltrated by plasma cells. Clinical manifestations: Severe pain in the lumbar and thoracic spine is the most common symptom. Pathological fractures. Local tenderness over the affected bones. Fatigue, and loss of weight. Neurological symptoms. Medical complications: Anaemia, hypercalcemia, hyperviscosity, immunosuppression, and renal dysfunction . Investigations: Skeletal survey to screen for bone lesions, and assess tumor burden and fracture risk: X-rays of the spine, skull, pelvis, ribs/sternum, and the humerus/femurs. Multiple punched-out lesions in the skull and other flat bones. In the skull, it may cause a ‘pepper-pot’ appearance. (Options A & B ruled out) Pathological wedge collapse of the vertebra (Common in the thoracic spine). (Option C ruled out) A. A lateral X-ray of the lumbar spine shows diffuse osteopenia and a pathologic compression fracture of the L1 vertebral body (arrow). B. A midsagittal T2-weighted MRI taken several months later shows extensive marrow infiltration and compression fractures of many vertebral bodies. CT is superior to X-ray for demonstrating fractures, osteolytic lesions, and soft-tissue masses. Urine: Bence Jones proteins Serum electrophoresis: Abnormal spike in the gamma globulin region (myeloma spike). Bone marrow biopsy : From the iliac crest. CT guided needle biopsy from the vertebral lesion. Treatment: Treatment of choice: Autologous stem cell transplantation (ASCT). Bisphosphonates to control hypercalcemia. In transplant-ineligible patients: Bortezomib, lenalidomide, and dexamethasone (VRd). Daratumumab, lenalidomide, and dexamethasone (DRd).",

      },
      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: C) Soap bubble appearance Explanation: Soap bubble appearance is the characteristic radiological finding of giant cell tumors. It presents as a lytic lesion with multiple internal septations, giving it a soap bubble appearance. It is usually located in the epiphysis of long bones, such as the distal femur. X-ray findings in Giant cell tumors (GCTs): Eccentric location, often subchondral. Expansion of the overlying cortex. The cortex may be thinned out. Lobulated lytic lesions with narrow zones of transition produce a soap bubble appearance. (Option C) No calcification within the tumor. No or minimal reactive sclerosis around the tumor. The tumor usually does not enter the adjacent joint. Treatment: The treatment of choice is excision . Followed by reconstruction procedures and bone grafting or polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA) insertion. Adjuvant treatments: Liquid nitrogen and phenol have been shown to decrease recurrences. Bisphosphonates like zoledronate or pamidronate Radiotherapy- especially for spine GCTs Drugs: Denosumab- anti-RANKL monoclonal antibody. Sun-rays appearance (Option A): It is typically seen in osteosarcoma. As the tumor grows into the overlying soft tissues new bone is laid down centrifugally along the blood vessels within the tumor which resembles rays of the sun. Onion peel appearance (Option B): It is associated with Ewing's sarcoma. It refers to concentric layers of rapid new periosteal bone formation that resemble the layers of an onion. Pepper pot appearance (Option D): It is commonly seen in multiple myeloma. The pepper pot or punched-out appearance refers to multiple small, round lytic lesions in the skull caused by the tumor.",

Chondroblastoma (Option D): It is a rare benign tumor that affects the epiphysis, usually seen in younger patients, but it does not typically show a bloody aspirate or hemosiderin deposits on FNA.

Radiological Features X-ray: Radiolucent area situated at the metaphysis. Osteolytic, poorly defined lesion elevating and eroding the cortex. MRI: Multiple intralesional septations and fluid levels. Angiography : Persistence of contrast and a blush of flow within the lesion. Histology Composed of blood-filled cystic spaces separated by fibrous septae. In chronic cases, the septae may contain woven bone. Treatment Surgery: Curettage and bone grafting Giant cell tumor (Option A): It usually occurs in adults near the ends of long bones, show a lytic lesion without fluid levels, and often extend into the subchondral bone. Osteosarcoma (Option B): It is a malignant bone tumor that presents with aggressive, mixed lytic-sclerotic lesions and periosteal reactions like Codman's triangle or sunburst appearance. Osteoid osteoma (Option D): It is a small, benign lesion typically causing nocturnal pain relieved by NSAIDs, and appears as a small nidus surrounded by sclerosis on imaging .",

Osteochondroma: Benign cartilaginous neoplasms arising from physeal cartilage beneath the periosteum. Growth via enchondral ossification, similar to normal bone development. More common in males, usually appearing during adolescence. Affects long bones, especially the femur and humerus. Clinical Presentation Usually presents as a painless mass. Symptoms may include: Formation of a bursa due to friction. Activity-related discomfort. Rare symptoms: Neuropathic pain from nerve compression. Sudden pain due to fracture. Types of Osteochondromas and Malignant Transformation Type Characteristics Risk of Malignant Transformation Solitary Osteochondroma Low risk (~1%). Difficult to determine exact incidence. ~1% Multiple Osteochondromas (MO) Higher risk (~4%). Autosomal dominant disorder with EXT1 or EXT2 gene mutations in 90% of cases. ~4% Factors affecting malignant transformation : Larger lesions with thicker cartilage caps (especially >1.5 cm). More common in trunk lesions, and rare in extremities. Suspicious changes in size or pain after skeletal maturity in MO patients. Radiographic Appearance Bony protuberance with well-defined borders. Key radiographic features : Cortex flaring into the osteochondroma. (Option B) Thin outer cortex with inner cancellous structure. Pedunculated (cauliflower-like summit) or broad sessile base. Pedunculated lesions point away from the joint toward the diaphysis. MRI findings : Cartilaginous cap thickness, generally thicker in children and thins with age. Note: Tumor appears small in radiograph and large when palpated because of the cartilage cap. Sclerotic margins with central lucency (Option A) : This is more suggestive of a bone cyst or other lesions, not osteochondroma. Irregular spiculated margins (Option C) : These are typically seen in malignant bone tumors, such as osteosarcoma. Joint erosion adjacent to the lesion (Option D) : Osteochondromas usually do not cause joint erosion, as they grow away from the joint.",
