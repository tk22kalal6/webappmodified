      "question": "A football player had a twist in the ankle and knee. Clinically, no bony injury was appreciated. The examiner is performing a test to assess the knee joint. Which test is this?",
      "options": {
        "A": "Posterior drawer for PCL",
        "B": "Mc Murray",
        "C": "Lachman",
        "D": "Anterior drawer for ACL"
      },
      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "assessing the stability of the knee. With the knee flexed at approximately 20-30 degrees, the examiner stabilizes the femur with one hand and pulls the tibia forward with the other. Increased forward movement of the tibia relative to the femur indicates ACL injury. Incorrect OptionS: Option A - Posterior Drawer for PCL : This test assesses the integrity of the posterior cruciate ligament (PCL). The examiner applies a posterior force to the tibia while the patient is in a supine position with the knee flexed. A positive test shows excessive posterior movement of the tibia relative to the femur, indicating PCL injury. Option B - McMurray Test : This test is used to assess meniscal tears. The examiner rotates the tibia while the knee is flexed and extended. Pain or a \"click\" during this maneuver suggests a meniscal tear, but it is not specific for ligament injuries. Option D - Anterior Drawer for ACL : This test is also used to assess the ACL. The patient lies supine with the knee flexed at 90 degrees. The examiner pulls the tibia forward while stabilizing the femur. Increased anterior movement of the tibia relative to the femur indicates ACL injury.",

      "question": "A counterforce brace is used in?",
      "options": {
        "A": "Tennis elbow",
        "B": "Ankle sprain",

      },
      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: A) Tennis elbow Explanation: A counterforce brace is primarily used for treating tennis elbow (lateral epicondylitis). It helps reduce the strain on the tendons by applying pressure to the forearm, which relieves pain and allows the muscles to rest. Lateral epicondylitis (Tennis elbow) Definition A condition characterized by pain and tenderness at the lateral epicondyle of the humerus due to non-specific inflammation at the origin of the extensor muscles of the forearm Causes Overuse of extensor muscles Repetitive activities (e.g., tennis, typing, using mouse) Non-specific inflammation at muscle origin Clinical Features Pain and tenderness precisely localized to the lateral epicondyle of the humerus Pain aggravated by extending the wrist against resistance Normal X-ray findings Tests Cozen's test: Also known as the resisted wrist extension test or resistive tennis elbow test, this test involves the patient making a fist and resisting wrist extension while the examiner applies pressure. The test is positive if the patient experiences pain on the lateral epicondyle. Maudsley's test: This test involves the patient pronating their forearm and resisting extension of the third digit of their hand while the examiner stabilizes the humerus. The test is positive if the patient experiences sudden pain on the lateral epicondyle. Mills's test: Another common test for tennis elbow. Treatment Initial: Analgesics, anti-inflammatory drugs If no response: Local injection of hydrocortisone at the point of maximum tenderness Physical therapy and activity modification Incorrect Options: Ankle Sprain (Option B) typically requires ankle supports, braces, or wraps for immobilization and stabilization, but not specifically a counterforce brace. Treatment usually involves rest, ice, compression, and elevation (R.I.C.E.), along with possible rehabilitation exercises. Ulnar Claw Hand (Option C) , a deformity caused by damage to the ulnar nerve, requires splints or other supportive devices to manage the hand’s positioning and function. A counterforce brace is not used for this condition; a static or dynamic splint is typically used to improve function. Foot Drop (Option D) , a condition characterized by difficulty lifting the foot due to weakness or paralysis of the anterior tibialis muscle, is usually treated with ankle-foot orthoses (AFOs) to support the foot and prevent dragging. A counterforce brace is not typically used for foot drop.

      "question": "A maid is playing with a child by spinning him while holding his hands. A few hours later, the child starts crying, does not use his arm, and does not let anybody touch him. What is the possible diagnosis?",
      "options": {
        "A": "Pulled elbow",
        "B": "Olecranon fracture",
        "C": "Fracture head of radius",
        "D": "Elbow dislocation"
      },
      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: A) Pulled elbow Explanation: The condition indicates a pulled elbow (nursemaid’s elbow) caused by a sudden pull on the arm, leading to radial head subluxation. The classic arm position is slightly flexed and pronated. Pulled Elbow (also known as Nursemaid’s Elbow) Age group 1-5 years (most common) Mechanism of injury A sudden jerk or pull on the arm when it is extended and pronated causes the radial head to slip out of the annular ligament (radial head subluxation). Clinical presentation The child holds the affected arm close to the body in a slightly flexed and pronated position, resisting movement, particularly supination. X-ray Diagnosis is usually clinical. X-ray is unnecessary unless there is suspicion of other injuries. It may appear normal If visible, they can show subtle displacement of the radial head , with the possible elevation of the anterior fat pad or visibility of the posterior fat pad, indicating joint effusion. Treatment Reduction of the subluxation by supination and flexion or hyperpronation of the forearm typically results in immediate relief. Incorrect options: Olecranon fracture (Option B): Caused due to fall on an outstretched hand or as a result of direct blow to elbow. May be transverse or comminuted fracture. Associated ulnar nerve injury can be seen. Fracture head of radius (Option C): Common in adults, caused due to fall on an outstretched hand or fall over the elbow. CT/MRI may be required if X-ray is inconclusive. Elbow dislocation (Option D): Common dislocation in children, caused by fall on an outstretched hand. The median nerve is most commonly injured.",

      "question": "What is the medical condition of a tennis player who is able to repeatedly and independently reduce a shoulder dislocation?",
      "options": {
        "A": "Acute shoulder dislocation",
        "B": "Recurrent shoulder dislocation",
        "C": "Inferior shoulder dislocation",
        "D": "Fracture upper end humerus"
      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: B) Recurrent shoulder dislocation Explanation: Recurrent Shoulder Dislocation occurs due to repeated dislocations, often with joint instability or capsular laxity . This patient can reduce the dislocation independently due to muscle memory or prior experience. It is common in athletes, especially those involved in overhead sports like tennis. Recurrent shoulder dislocation is the most common complication following an initial dislocation. It occurs due to repeated trauma, capsular laxity, bone changes, muscle weakness, inadequate rehabilitation, or high-risk activities. Hill-Sachs and Bankart lesions , associated with shoulder dislocations, contribute to joint instability and increase the risk of recurrence. Complications of Shoulder Dislocation: Early Complications Delayed Complications Rotator cuff tear - Common in the elderly due to degenerative changes in the tendons and less common in younger patients. Axillary artery injury - Rare; Occurs with severe trauma Nerve injury - The axillary nerve is most commonly affected; other nerve injuries and complete brachial plexus palsy are rare. Recurrence - Most common, due to instability. Joint stiffness - Results from prolonged immobility. Unreduced dislocation - Due to missed or undiagnosed dislocation. Acute Shoulder Dislocation (Option A) refers to a single episode of dislocation, typically requiring immediate reduction. The patient would not be able to repeatedly reduce it independently, making this option incorrect. Inferior Shoulder Dislocation (Option C) : Rare and occurs when the humeral head is displaced downward . It typically results from significant trauma and would not be easily reduced independently. Fracture of Upper End Humerus (Option D) involves a fracture of the humeral head or neck, which may mimic dislocation but wouldn't allow the patient to repeatedly reduce the dislocation independently. Fractures require different management and do not typically present with recurrent dislocations. Reference: Apley and Solomon’s System of Orthopaedics and Trauma, 10th edition, Page 763, 764, 386.",

      "question": "A 25 year old Volleyball player presents to your OPD with injury to thumb,along with pain, swelling, and tenderness at the base of the thumb. On examination the thumb is in the position of abduction. Which of the following is the diagnosis of the presenting condition?",
      "options": {
        "A": "Game keepers thumb",
        "B": "Bowler's thumb",
        "C": "Kaplan injury",
        "D": "Mallet finger"
      },
      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: A) Game keepers thumb Explanation: The injury described in the question, with pain , swelling , tenderness at the base of the thumb , and the thumb in the position of abduction , is consistent with Gamekeeper's Thumb (also known as Skier's Thumb ). Ulnar Collateral Ligament Injury : Known as Gamekeeper’s Thumb or Skier’s Thumb , caused by hyperabduction of the thumb (e.g., falling onto an extended thumb). Injury Types : Partial Rupture : Only the ligament is torn; instability in flexion but stable in extension. Complete Rupture : Both the ligament and palmar plate are torn; instability in all positions. Stener Lesion : When the ligament pulls away from its attachment and doesn’t heal unless repaired. Clinical Assessment : Tenderness and swelling over the ulnar side of the thumb. X-ray to rule out fractures. Stress tests to check for laxity. Laxity in flexion and extension suggests complete rupture requiring surgery. Treatment : Partial Tears : Immobilization in a splint for 2-4 weeks, avoiding pinch for 6-8 weeks. Complete Tears : Surgical repair required, with care to avoid damaging the superficial radial nerve. Post-surgery: Thumb immobilized in a splint for 6 weeks, with early movement in the flexion-extension plane. Bowler's Thumb (Option B) : Refers to a condition caused by compression of the ulnar nerve at the hypothenar eminence (not an injury to the thumb ligament). Kaplan injury (Option C) : Refers to an injury to the flexor tendon of the thumb, often seen in deep cuts to the palm or thumb, not related to hyperabduction. Mallet Finger (Option D) : Involves injury to the extensor tendon of the finger, causing an inability to straighten the distal joint, which is not the case here.

        "D": "Lateral lemniscus"
      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: B) Medial collateral ligament Explanation: The MCL is a ligament located on the inner side of the knee joint that helps stabilize the knee against excessive sideways or valgus stress. It connects the femur (thigh bone) to the tibia (shin bone) and plays a crucial role in maintaining the integrity of the knee joint. Anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) (Option A): While the ACL is another important ligament in the knee, it is not directly associated with MCL injuries. The ACL is located inside the knee joint and is responsible for controlling rotational and anterior translation of the tibia in relation to the femur. Posterior cruciate ligament (PCL) (Option C): The PCL is also an internal ligament of the knee, but it is not commonly associated with MCL injuries. The PCL helps stabilize the knee against posterior translation of the tibia in relation to the femur. Lateral meniscus (Option D): The lateral meniscus is the counterpart of the medial meniscus and is located on the outer side of the knee joint. It is not directly associated with MCL injuries. However, it can be injured independently or in conjunction with other knee injuries. Reference: MCL ligament",

      "explanation": "Correct Answer: B) Patella Tendon Bearing Brace. Explanation: A patella tendon bearing brace, also known as a patellar tendon brace or patellar tendon strap, is a specialized brace designed to provide targeted support and compression to the patellar tendon. It is commonly used in conditions such as patellar tendonitis or jumper's knee, where there is pain or inflammation in the patellar tendon. Ankle Knee Stabilizer (Option A): Type of brace or support that provides stability to both the ankle and knee joints. It is commonly used in cases of ligament injuries or instability in these joints. Thomas Splint (Option C): Specific type of splint used for immobilization and stabilization of the femur or thigh bone. It is commonly used in cases of fractures or dislocations of the femur.",
