      "options": {
        "A": "Head of Humerus",
        "B": "Elbow joint",
        "C": "Wrist joint",
        "D": "Sternum"
      },
      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "pressure epiphysis as it forms the shoulder joint and bears load during movements. Types of Epiphysis: Pressure Epiphysis – Participates in joint formation and weight transmission (e.g., head of humerus, lower end of radius). Traction Epiphysis – Non-articular, does not transmit weight (e.g., greater/lesser trochanter of femur, greater/lesser tubercle of humerus, mastoid process). Atavistic Epiphysis – Once independent but fused for nutrition (e.g., coracoid process of scapula, os trigonum). Aberrant Epiphysis – Not always present (e.g., head of the first metacarpal, base of other metacarpals). The other options (elbow joint, wrist joint, and sternum) are not classified as pressure epiphyses. Reference: https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC2564388/",

        "A": "Vertebrae fracture",

      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "known as wedge compression fractures, typically resulting from a flexion force. These fractures usually maintain stability as the posterior elements remain intact. Incorrect Options: Options B, C & D: Fractures in osteoporosis typically result from low-trauma incidents, such as falls from standing height or less. However, fractures in locations like the subtrochanteric region, glenoid, and midshaft of the humerus often require higher forces. The initial fracture in osteoporosis often involves the distal radius (Colles’ fracture), followed by vertebral and hip fractures if not treated promptly. Reference: .",

Incorrect Options: Option A :Osteomalacia: Looser's zones or milkman fracture or pseudofracture is seen on the radiograph.

        "A": "Osteoporosis",

      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "density and increased bone fragility, making individuals more susceptible to fractures, especially in the hip, spine, and wrist. In the case of an elderly lady who experienced a fall and was diagnosed with a fractured neck of the femur (hip fracture), osteoporosis is a likely contributing factor. Incorrect Options: Option B - Osteopetrosis: Osteopetrosis is a rare genetic disorder characterized by increased bone density and abnormal bone growth. While it can lead to brittle bones and increased risk of fractures, it is a rare condition and not commonly the underlying cause of fractures in elderly individuals following falls. Option C - Osteoarthritis: Osteoarthritis is a degenerative joint disease characterized by the breakdown of cartilage in the joints, it does not directly affect bone density or increase the risk of fractures. Option D - Osteomalacia: Osteomalacia is a condition characterized by softening of the bones due to vitamin D deficiency or problems with vitamin D metabolism. Osteomalacia is more commonly associated with generalized bone pain, muscle weakness, and fractures in weight-bearing bones. Reference: Prepladder Notes",
