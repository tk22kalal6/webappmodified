      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: B) Transient synovitis Explanation: The child’s age (6 years) and the acute onset of a painful limp with mild fever (<38°C) and good overall health are characteristic of transient synovitis. Irritable Hip (Transient Synovitis) Definition: Non-pyogenic inflammation and hypertrophy of the synovial membrane. Aetiology: Causes: Viral or bacterial infections, allergic reactions, and trauma. Most common in children aged 3–9 years (peak at 6 years). Presentation & Examination: Symptoms: Acute limp with pain referred to the thigh, knee, or buttock. Examination: Limited weight-bearing, hip flexion and external rotation to reduce pressure, reduced range of motion (especially internal rotation), mild low-grade fever (<38°C), and otherwise well child. Investigation: Diagnosis by exclusion after ruling out conditions like septic arthritis. Treatment: NSAIDs for pain, bed rest, and crutches if needed. Septic Arthritis: Life-threatening infection. Kocher Criteria: Fever >38°C, refusal to bear weight, elevated ESR/WBC. Immediate treatment with joint irrigation, debridement, and antibiotics is essential. Transient Synovitis vs septic arthritis No high fever or systemic illness as seen in septic arthritis. Self-limiting with mild symptoms, typically resolving without aggressive treatment. Imaging may show joint effusion but no joint destruction, as seen in septic arthritis. XRAY SHOWING TRANSIENT SYNOVITIS XRAY SHOWING SEPTIC ARTHRITIS Septic Arthritis \" data-author=\"C.

Legg-Calvé-Perthes disease (Option C) tends to have a more chronic, insidious onset and affects children of a similar age, but the acute presentation and mild fever make it less likely here. Osteomyelitis (Option D) usually presents with localized pain, fever, and elevated inflammatory markers, which are not prominent in this case.",

Involucrum (new bone formation around the sequestrum) is shown surrounding the area, marked by the white arrow. Cloaca (an opening in the involucrum allowing pus drainage) is indicated by the red arrow. Sequestrum Involucrum Cloaca Definition : A piece of dead bone separated from living bone due to infection. Formation : Occurs in neglected cases of acute osteomyelitis, resulting from tissue destruction. Characteristics : Size varies; can range from small spicules to large necrotic segments of the cortex. Clinical Significance : Remains entombed within the bone, inaccessible for destruction or repair. Definition : New bone formation around the infected zone. Formation : Develops on viable surfaces in the bone and from the deep layers of the stripped periosteum.",

        "D": "Fracture of the scaphoid"
      },
      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: A) Negative ulnar variance Explanation: This scenario suggests Kienböck’s disease due to ischemic necrosis of the lunate, typically caused by repetitive wrist stress and presenting with wrist pain, stiffness, and tenderness over the lunate. Negative ulnar variance refers to a condition in which the ulna is shorter than the radius compared to the normal anatomical alignment. When present, it increases pressure on the lunate, leading to impaired blood flow and ischemic necrosis, characteristic of Kienböck’s disease. Kienböck’s Disease Definition: Ischemic necrosis of the lunate bone, likely due to chronic stress or injury, with a possible association with negative ulnar variance. Causes: Chronic Stress/Trauma: Repeated wrist stress compromises blood flow to the lunate. Negative Ulnar Variance: May increase stress on the lunate, though not definitively proven. Other Factors: Predisposing factors include wrist fractures, anatomical variations, and vascular anomalies. Clinical Features: Affects young adults, often without a clear trauma history. Symptoms: Wristache, stiffness, tenderness over the lunate, reduced grip strength, and painful movements in later stages. Imaging: X-rays: Normal in early stages, later showing density changes, bone irregularities, or collapse. MRI: Best for detecting early changes, even when X-rays are normal. Treatment: Non-Operative: Wrist splinting to relieve pain. Operative: Early Stages: Revascularization via pedicled bone grafts. Stress Reduction: Radial or capitate shortening, or radial tilting. Advanced Stages: Proximal row carpectomy, scaphocapitate fusion, or wrist arthrodesis for pain relief and stability. Carpal tunnel syndrome (Option B), rheumatoid arthritis (Option C), and scaphoid fracture (Option D) are not directly related to Kienböck's disease.

      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: B) Anaemia and thrombocytopenia Explanation: In Gaucher’s disease, Infiltration of the bone marrow by Gaucher's cells leads to the classic triad of symptoms: anaemia (low red blood cell count), leukopenia (low white blood cell count), and thrombocytopenia (low platelet count), resulting in pancytopenia. Gaucher's Disease and Osteonecrosis: The most common site of AVN is the hip , with lesions also appearing in the distal femur , talus, and humerus. Gaucher's cells: Accumulation of glucosylceramide in reticuloendothelial cells (Gaucher’s cells) occludes medullary sinusoids, leading to ischemia and skeletal pathology. Bone marrow involvement: Gaucher’s cells infiltrate the bone marrow, causing pancytopenia (anaemia, leukopenia, thrombocytopenia). Bone deformity: Replacement of myeloid tissue by Gaucher's cells causes expansion of tubular bones, especially in the distal femur, producing the Erlenmeyer flask deformity on X-ray. Elevated serum calcium levels (Option A) : This is not typically associated with Gaucher's disease and could indicate other metabolic issues. The serum acid phosphatase is usually elevated in this disease. Hyperuricemia (Option C) : This condition is more common in disorders like gout, not specifically in Gaucher's disease. Increased bone density on X-ray (Option D) : Patients with Gaucher's disease often exhibit reduced bone density due to avascular necrosis and bone deformities, not increased density. Reference:",

      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: B) Stage 1 Explanation: The clinical scenario points to Stage 1 because it represents the early resorptive phase of avascular necrosis (AVN) where X-rays appear normal, but MRI reveals early changes indicative of bone marrow oedema and resorption. Ficat and Arlet Staging of AVN (Avascular Necrosis): Stage 0 (Option A ruled out) Preclinical and preradiological, AVN is suggested only if diagnosed in another area (e.g., opposite hip). Stage 1 Early resorptive phase; X-rays normal, but changes seen on MRI or bone scintigraphy. Stage 2 (Option C ruled out) Reparative stage with normal femoral head contour; early signs of reactive subchondral changes. Stage 3 (Option D ruled out) The early collapse of the femoral head with clear X-ray signs of osteonecrosis, structural damage, and bone outline distortion. Stage 4 Collapse of the articular surface with secondary osteoarthritis (OA). Treatment Based on Stages: Early Stages (0-2) Watchful waiting for lesions in non-weight-bearing joints. Drug therapy (e.g., bisphosphonates, statins) may help. Medullary decompression and bone grafting for femoral head necrosis. Unloading osteotomy to preserve anatomy in weight-bearing joints. Intermediate Stage (3) Realignment osteotomy with/without curettage and bone grafting of the necrotic segment. Late Stage (4) Non-operative management: pain control, activity modification. Arthrodesis for stability (e.g., ankle, wrist). Joint replacement (hip, knee, shoulder). Reference: Reference: Apley and Solomon’s System of Orthopaedics and Trauma, 10th Edition, Pages 112,113",

      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: B) Visual inspection of the lesion Explanation: The clinical scenario aligns with guinea worm arthritis due to the symptoms of painful, inflamed skin lesions and the occupation and background history of the patient. The diagnosis of guinea worm arthritis is confirmed through a visual inspection of the lesion , where the adult worm (Dracunculus medinensis) is seen emerging from the skin, indicating an active infection. Smallpox Osteomyelitis (Osteomyelitis Variolosa) Guinea Worm Arthritis Cause: Osteoarticular involvement from Variola major virus during childhood smallpox infection. Affected Areas: Symmetrical involvement, primarily in elbows (80%), wrists, ankles, hands, and feet; spine and pelvis are rarely involved. Symptoms: Gradual swelling of joints, leading to bone deformities and joint instability. Diagnosis- Clinical Examination: Detection of bilateral, symmetrical joint deformities Treatment: Self-limiting- The condition cannot be prevented or repaired. Seen endemic in Rajasthan, due to the use of stepwells. Cause: Infection with Dracunculus medinensis from drinking water containing infected copepods. Symptoms: Painful, inflamed skin lesion containing an adult worm. Diagnosis: Visual inspection of the lesion; calcified worms can be detected via X-ray. Treatment: Slow, careful removal of the adult worm. Osteomyelitis variolosa X-ray imaging of the knee (Option A): While X-rays can show changes in bone structure, they are not the primary method for diagnosing this specific condition. MRI of the affected joint (Option C) : MRI can provide detailed imaging of joint involvement, but it is not necessary for the diagnosis of this particular condition. Joint aspiration for synovial fluid analysis (Option D): While joint aspiration can be useful in other types of arthritis, it is not the key diagnostic tool for this condition.",

      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: B) Tom Smith Arthritis (TSA) Explanation: Tom Smith Arthritis (TSA) is the most likely diagnosis due to the acute presentation of fever and joint effusion specifically in the hip joint of an infant, characteristic of this pyogenic infection. Definition: Pyogenic /Septic arthritis of the hip joint in infancy, caused by nontuberculous bacteria. Pathophysiology: The femoral head is cartilaginous and vulnerable to destruction due to infection. Imaging Findings: Periarticular soft tissue swelling, chondrolysis of HOF, joint effusions, abscesses, and soft tissue involvement. Joint Affected: Primarily the hip joint in infants, though other joints may be affected later in life. Complications: destruction of the femoral head and neck. Treatment: Combined medical and surgical approach, including drainage and possibly synovial biopsy if needed. Reactive arthritis (Option A) usually follows a prior infection, is rare in infants with acute fever and joint swelling, and is more common in adults after STDs or gastrointestinal infections. Transient synovitis (Option C) : Common in toddlers but generally presents with milder symptoms and no fever, unlike this case, the presentation of effusion and acute joint symptoms is more typical of Tom Smith’s arthritis. Developmental Dysplasia of the Hip (DDH) (Option D) : This is a structural issue rather than an infectious one, making it less likely given the acute symptoms and ultrasound findings.",

      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: C) Parrot's joint Explanation: Parrot's joint or Parrot’s syphilitic joint is associated with early congenital syphilis, characterized by joint effusion and periostitis. Syphilitic osteomyelitis Cause : Treponema pallidum (spirochaete), transmitted sexually or transplacentally (congenital syphilis). Pathogenesis : Enters via skin/mucosal contact → spreads to lymph nodes → bloodstream. Congenital syphilis Acquired syphilis Cause : Transplacental transmission during pregnancy. Early congenital syphilis : Diagnosed from birth through 2 years of age Parrot’s Syphilitic Joint : congenital syphilis complication with periostitis and pain.Leads to joint effusion, epiphysitis, and limited movement. X-rays : Osteochondritis (lucent bands near physis), periostitis (mild or ‘onion-peel’ effect). Late congenital syphilis : Diagnosed after 2 years of birth Features : Gummata and other bone lesions Sabre tibia -the tibial bone has a pronounced anterior bowing (i.e., bends forward) (Option B ruled out) Hutchinson’s teeth (Option A ruled out) - abnormal. Notched teeth Clutton’s joints - Painless swelling in elbows and knees. Parrot's sign , or 'Parrot's nodes'/'Parrot's bosses,' refers to bony growths observed on the skulls of children with congenital syphilis. Higoumenakis' sign refers to the enlargement of the sternal end of the right clavicle Early acquired syphilis : Painful/tender bones: Frontal skull bones, tibia, sternum, ribs. X-rays: Periostitis, thickened cortex Hydrarthrosis : Late acquired syphilis : Syphilitic gumma: Granulomatous lesions with bone resorption, sclerosis. Charcot’s Joint : Nerve damage leads to loss of sensation in the joint, most commonly affecting the foot and ankle. (Option D ruled out) Hutchinson teeth Sabre tibia Higoumenakis sign Treatment of Syphilis Early syphilis : Weekly intramuscular benzylpenicillin for 3-4 doses. Late syphilis : High-dose IV penicillin for 7-10 days, may be ineffective for some tertiary forms.",

      "explanation": "Correct Answer: C) Brucellar osteomyelitis Explanation: The combination of fluctuating low-grade fevers, night sweats, and joint pain, especially in a milkman, aligns perfectly with the presentation of brucella infection due to occupational exposure. Aetiology Caused by Brucella melitensis, Brucella abortus (cattle), and Brucella suis (pigs). Transmission via unpasteurized milk or contact with infected meat (farmers, meat handlers). Pathology Entry through infected milk, skin, or mucosal surfaces . Spreads via lymphatics and bloodstream to bones (often vertebral bodies) or synovium. Granulomatous inflammation Common Sites Sacroiliac and spinal joints are most frequently involved Clinical Features Initial symptoms: Alternating fever and improvement phases ( undulant fever ), headache, generalized weakness, joint pains, and backache. Joint involvement: Pain, swelling, tenderness, restricted movement (commonly in hip, knee, spine). X-ray Findings Subacute arthritis with articular space loss, bone erosion, and periarticular osteoporosis. Spine: Destruction and collapse of vertebral bodies, disc obliteration Treatment Antibiotics: Tetracycline + streptomycin (3–4 weeks) Surgery: Drainage of abscess, excision of necrotic tissue, arthrodesis/arthroplasty if joint destruction occurs. Osteoarthritis (Option A): Typically presents with activity-related joint pain and stiffness without systemic symptoms like fever or night sweats, making it unlikely in this case. Tuberculosis osteomyelitis (Option B): While it can cause bone pain and systemic symptoms, the lack of respiratory symptoms and the patient's occupation makes brucella osteomyelitis more probable.

        "C": "Acute exacerbation",
        "D": "Chronic joint pain"
      },
      "correct_answer": "D",
      "explanation": "Correct answer: D) Chronic joint pain Explanation: While chronic joint pain may occur in various conditions, it is not a direct complication of chronic osteomyelitis itself. Chronic joint pain can arise from numerous causes, including arthritis or prior injuries, but it does not specifically relate to osteomyelitis. Pathological fracture (Option A): The ongoing osteomyelitis can cause significant damage and cavitation within the bone, increasing the risk of fractures even from minor trauma. As a result, the affected bone becomes brittle, making pathological fractures a common occurrence in patients with chronic osteomyelitis. Squamous cell carcinoma (Option B): Although relatively rare, squamous cell carcinoma can develop in the area of a long-standing draining sinus associated with chronic osteomyelitis.

However, it does not differentiate between soft tissue infections and bone involvement. Radionuclide Scintigraphy (Option D): While this can detect early osteomyelitis and hidden infection sites, it is less specific for soft tissue involvement and often used in conjunction with other imaging modalities.

      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Correct answer: C) Increased density Explanation: A sequestrum appears denser than the surrounding living bone on an X-ray because it is no longer involved in the normal bone remodelling or decalcification process. The lack of blood supply and ongoing inflammatory process preserve the mineral content, making it a bright, dense structure on imaging. Visually, they are pale in colour, with a smooth inner surface and a rough outer surface where surrounding tissue tries to erode it. Increased radiolucency (Option A): A sequestrum is denser and would appear brighter, not darker or more radiolucent, on an X-ray . Reduced density (Option B): Sequestra retain their density due to the lack of remodelling, so they appear denser, not less dense, than living bone. Fracture line (Option D): While a sequestrum can be separated from living bone, the appearance is typically characterized by increased density rather than a visible fracture line.

Chronic Osteomyelitis: According to Waldvogel's classification, it is an osteomyelitis persisting for more than 4 weeks. Most common cause - Staphylococcus aureus (Same in both acute and subacute osteomyelitis) In foreign body implants - Staphylococcus epidermidis is the most common. Clinical Features of Chronic Osteomyelitis: Recurrent Symptoms : Pain, fever, redness, and tenderness that occur in periodic 'flare-ups.' Chronic Discharging Sinus : A persistent discharge of pus through sinus tracts that form in the skin as a natural mechanism for draining infection. Tissue Changes : Thickening, puckering, or inward folding of surrounding tissues due to scarring. Bone Deformity or Non-Union : Post-traumatic cases may show bone deformities or improper healing. Systemic Symptoms : Generally few, but flare-ups may cause fever, chills, and malaise. Other Signs : Seropurulent fluid drainage. Surrounding skin may become excoriated. Acute osteomyelitis (Option A) : More rapid onset(<2 weeks) with prominent systemic symptoms like fever, and abscess formation. Ewing’s sarcoma (Option B) : Malignant tumour that presents with aggressive symptoms, including a mass and systemic signs like fever. While it can cause bone deformity, the history of an open fracture and the presence of a discharging sinus point more towards an infectious process rather than a tumour. Osteoid osteoma (Option D) : A benign tumour characterised by localised pain, often relieved by NSAIDs, and a radiological finding of a small nidus.",

The lack of abscess formation and negative cultures align with this diagnosis. Garre's Osteomyelitis: Definition : A rare form of chronic osteomyelitis characterised by sclerosis (bone hardening) and cortical thickening. Key Feature : Non-suppurative (no abscess formation); presents as diffuse bone enlargement. Cause: Though cultures are mostly negative. It is usually due to staphylococcal infection. Common Sites : Mandible> diaphysis of long bones (tibia, femur) Typical Age : Adolescents and young adults. Symptoms : Aching, mild swelling, recurrent acute pain, malaise, mild fever. Radiographic Findings : Increased bone density, sclerosis, cortical thickening, potential marrow cavity obliteration. Differential Diagnosis : Can resemble bone tumours (e.g., Ewing’s sarcoma, osteoid osteoma). Diagnosis : Biopsy is required.

      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: A) Brodie's abscess Explanation: Brodie's abscess is a subacute, subperiosteal abscess that typically occurs in children and adolescents. It is characterised by a well-defined, lytic lesion in the metaphysis of long bones, often with a surrounding sclerotic rim. The pain is often intermittent and may be mild. Subacute Osteomyelitis: Definition: A type of osteomyelitis. It is caused by less virulent organisms or in patients with greater resistance. It commonly affects the upper and lower ends of the tibia more than the femur metaphysis . Causative Organisms: Staphylococcus aureus - most common cause of all forms of osteomyelitis. Streptococcus Pneumococcus Salmonella - is commonly seen in children with sickle cell anaemia. Brodie's Abscess: A localized, subacute form of osteomyelitis , caharacterized by a walled-off area of infection within the bone, typically in the metaphysis of long bones. It presents as a lytic lesion surrounded by a sclerotic rim on imaging and is often associated with deep boring pain. An X-ray image shows a circumscribed, round/oval area of lucency surrounded by a halo of sclerosis which is diagnostic of this disease. Commonly seen in the upper tibia and lower femur. It is usually located at the metaphysis. Treatment: Surgical curettage under antibiotic coverage. Typhoid Osteomyelitis: Definition : A subacute form of osteomyelitis that occurs during recovery from typhoid fever. Common Sites : Ulna, tibia, vertebrae; can involve multiple bones, sometimes bilaterally. Risk Factor : More common in children with sickle cell anaemia. Radiological Feature : Diaphyseal sclerosis (hardening of the bone shaft) Garre’s Osteomyelitis (Option B): It is a variant of chronic osteomyelitis with excessive bone formation, also known as Garre's sclerosing osteomyelitis, which leads to diffuse thickening rather than a well-circumscribed lesion. Salmonella osteomyelitis (Option C): While Salmonella can cause osteomyelitis, it is more common in young adults and children with sickle cell disease. The radiographic findings of Salmonella osteomyelitis are typically more extensive than those seen in Brodie's abscess. Ewing’s sarcoma (Option D) is a malignant bone tumour that typically affects children and adolescents. It often presents with a rapid onset of pain, swelling, and fever. The radiographic findings of Ewing’s sarcoma are typically more extensive than those seen in Brodie's abscess and often show a \"laminated\" or \"onion-skin\" periosteal reaction.",

      "explanation": "Correct Answer: C) Aspiration of pus Explanation: The clinical features, including fever, acute tenderness, and severe pain with reluctance to move the limb, strongly suggest acute osteomyelitis . These signs indicate an infection that requires confirmation. Aspiration of pus is the confirmatory investigation, as it allows for direct sampling from the suspected site of infection, enabling microbiological examination and antibiotic sensitivity testing, which confirm the diagnosis of acute osteomyelitis. Investigations of Acute Osteomyelitis X-ray Normal during the 1st week. Periosteal new bone formation (periosteal reaction) by 7-10 days. Classical X-ray sign of acute pyogenic osteomyelitis. Later signs Periosteal thickening becomes more obvious. Patchy rarefaction of the metaphysis is observed. Ragged features of bone destruction appear. Important late sign Regional Osteoporosis -metabolically active living bone. The segment that does not become osteoporotic is metabolically inactive and may be dead. Osteomyelitis of Tibia MRI Most sensitive even in the early phase. Detects bone marrow oedema in osteomyelitis within 24 hours The best method of demonstrating bone marrow inflammation. Radio scintigraphy with Gallium citrate - highly sensitive but less specific. SPECT/CT imaging Offers better anatomical localization and a more accurate definition of infection extent compared to conventional planar studies and SPECT alone. It effectively differentiates between soft tissue and bone infections, assesses suspected infected sites with structural bone changes, and clearly defines infective foci in complex anatomical areas. Aspiration of pus - Confirmation of the diagnosis. Aspirate from the metaphyseal subperiosteal abscess, extraosseous soft tissues, or an adjacent joint using a 16- or 18-gauge trocar needle. Even if no pus is present, send a smear of the aspirate for microbiological examination and antibiotic sensitivity testing. MRI (Option A) : While MRI is sensitive for detecting bone marrow inflammation and can show changes associated with osteomyelitis, it does not provide direct evidence of infection and is not a definitive diagnostic tool. CT imaging (Option B) is less sensitive for early-stage osteomyelitis, as it primarily shows bone destruction, which occurs later in the disease process. Bone scan (Option D) : A bone scan is sensitive for detecting increased metabolic activity in bones, indicating potential infection; however, it lacks specificity and cannot confirm the presence of infection or identify the causative organism",

Pseudoparalysis Pseudoparalysis is characterised by acute tenderness near larger joints, such as above or below the knee, in the popliteal fossa, or the groin. The limb is held still, and even the gentlest manipulation causes pain, leading to restricted joint movement. This results in a condition where the affected limb appears paralyzed, despite the absence of true neurological impairment.

      "explanation": "capillary loops. Correct Answer: A) Hobo suggested that acute osteomyelitis develops due to sluggish blood flow in capillary loops. Explanation: Hobo suggested that acute osteomyelitis develops due to sluggish blood flow in capillary loops. Hobo's Theory: Suggested that acute osteomyelitis develops in the metaphyses of long bones due to sluggish blood flow in capillary loops. (Option A) Proposed that vascular stasis leads to susceptibility to infection following minor trauma, allowing bacteria to lodge in the area. Trueta's Theory: Supported Hobo’s theory through investigations into bone blood-flow properties. Conducted studies using light microscopy and vessel perfusion techniques to understand the blood flow characteristics in bones. Acute osteomyelitis begins in a system of “blood lakes” at the intrametaphyseal capillary loop beneath the growth plate, where blood flow is slower . (Option C ruled out) The infection spreads from the venous side of the loops, leading to secondary thrombosis of the branches of the nutrient artery and the artery itself. Extensive involvement of the metaphyseal veins causes oedema, which expands towards the surface of the bone, particularly over the thinnest part of the cortex at the distal metaphysis. The oedema raises the periosteum from the cortex, disrupting vascular connections and allowing pus formation. Growth cartilage protects the epiphysis ; but in infants , this barrier is compromised, allowing infection to spread. (Option D ruled out) Growth cartilage offers only a relative barrier, allowing metaphyseal sepsis to spread to the joint. Acute osteomyelitis, septic childhood arthritis, and infant osteoarthritis may be manifestations of the same disease process. Hobo indicated that infection in the metaphysis occurs primarily due to direct invasion of the periosteum. (Option B): Hobo focused on blood flow issues rather than direct periosteal invasion.",

These clinical features are consistent with acute osteomyelitis , likely due to a bacterial infection of the bone. By the end of Week 1, rising intraosseous pressure and periosteal stripping lead to bone death (necrosis) and sequestra formation, making this the correct answer. Pathophysiology of Acute Osteomyelitis The most common part of bone affected in children and adults is metaphysis . Day 1: Acute inflammation in the metaphysis with vascular congestion, fluid exudation, and infiltration by polymorphonuclear leukocytes. Intraosseous pressure rises, causing intense pain, blood flow obstruction, and thrombosis. Days 2–3 : Pus/Abscess forms in the bone, spreads through Volkmann canals, and creates a subperiosteal abscess, especially in children. Pus may enter surrounding soft tissues or joints. (Options A & C ruled out) End of Week 1 : Rising intraosseous pressure and periosteal stripping compromise blood flow, leading to bone death (necrosis) and the formation of sequestra (dead bone segments). Beyond Week 1 : Granulation tissue defines the boundary between living and dead bone. Macrophages and lymphocytes arrive, initiating bone resorption and removal of debris. (Options A & D ruled out) Late Stage : New bone ( involucrum ) forms around the infected area, and pus may discharge through the cloacae and sinuses if the infection persists. (Option D ruled out) If untreated, the infection may become chronic, with persistent sinuses and intermittent pus discharge. If treated early, bone healing occurs, though sometimes with residual deformity.",
