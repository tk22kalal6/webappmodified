      "explanation": "Correct Answer: B) Arthroscopic synovectomy and loose body removal Explanation: The patient presents with knee pain, swelling, reduced range of motion, and mechanical locking, which are hallmark features of synovial chondromatosis. The X-ray showing multiple calcified loose bodies and the MRI confirming lobular cartilage nodules with areas of calcification further support this diagnosis. Given the severe symptoms (pain, limited motion, and locking) and imaging findings of calcified loose bodies, arthroscopic synovectomy and removal of the loose bodies is the recommended treatment. This approach addresses both symptom relief and prevents further joint damage. Imaging Radiographs : Standard anteroposterior (AP) and lateral views of the affected joint are recommended. Findings vary by disease stage and may show stippled calcification.

      "explanation": "Correct Answer: C) Final stage (Class III) Explanation: Presenting with progressive knee pain, swelling, reduced range of motion, and mechanical locking, with X-ray showing multiple calcified loose bodies in the joint space are features consistent with synovial chondromatosis , a condition where loose chondroid bodies form in the joint. The absence of active synovial involvement on imaging, combined with the presence of calcified loose bodies, classifies this case as Class III (Final stage) of Milgram's classification. Synovial Chondromatosis Synovial chondromatosis is a benign condition where the synovial membrane of joints forms multiple loose chondroid bodies, leading to joint pain, swelling, and decreased range of motion. Sites: Knee : Most common Shoulder Hip Elbow Presents with joint pain as the chief complaint, often accompanied by swelling, reduced range of motion, and occasionally crepitus and mechanical locking during movement.

      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: B) Halo fixation for 6 to 12 weeks Explanation: Halo fixation for 6 to 12 weeks is the correct treatment for Type 2 fractures of Levin and Edward Classification with subluxation greater than 3 mm but less than 5 mm. It provides sufficient immobilization for the fracture to heal. C2 Traumatic Spondylolisthesis (Hangman’s Fracture) Cause : Traditionally from judicial hanging; now more commonly due to hyperextension injuries (e.g., force to the forehead, Forsyth mechanism). Injury : Results in anterior translation at C2, leading to pars fractures and possible C2/3 disc disruption. Neurological Injury : Uncommon, as the fractures can expand the spinal canal. Stability Assessment : Depends on C2/3 disc status and facet integrity. Levine & Edward Classification Treatment Type 1 : Less than 3 mm subluxation, stable Rigid cervical collar (Option A) Type 2 : Greater than 4 mm subluxation, unstable -Less than 5 mm - Reduction in axial traction and halo fixation for 6 to 12 weeks -Greater than 5 mm - Require surgery (Option C) Type 2a : Unstable with flexion injury and angular deformity Halo fixation Type 3 : Unstable with facet and anterior longitudinal ligament disruption Require surgery (Option C) Conservative management with analgesics and observation (Option D) : This approach would not be appropriate for an unstable fracture like Type 2, as it requires immobilization to ensure proper healing and to prevent further displacement.

      "question": "A 35-year-old male is brought to the emergency department after a high-impact motorcycle accident. He presents with significant swelling and bruising in the lower abdomen and thighs. During the examination, he exhibits tenderness upon palpation of the abdomen. Pelvic compression test is positive. The patient is unable to void, and the bladder is not palpable. What is the most appropriate initial management step for this patient?",

        "D": "Initiate strict bed rest and monitor vital signs"
      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: B) Apply pelvic binders and initiate resuscitation Explanation: The patient is suspected to have pelvic fractures due to significant swelling and bruising in the lower abdomen and thighs, tenderness indicating possible intraperitoneal bleeding, a positive pelvic compression test and an inability to void suggesting a potential bladder rupture. Applying pelvic binders helps stabilize the pelvis and reduce hemorrhage while initiating resuscitation is critical for managing potential hemorrhagic shock. Clinical Features of Pelvic Fractures Swelling and Bruising : Lower abdomen, thighs, perineum, scrotum, or vulva. Abdominal Tenderness : Indicates intraperitoneal bleeding. Extraperitoneal Bladder Rupture : Suspect if unable to void or palpate bladder; may lead to significant hemorrhage. Neurological Damage : Assess for lumbosacral plexus injury, especially in unconscious patients Treatment of Pelvic Ring Fractures: Initial Management : Follow ATLS protocol (Advanced Trauma Life Support). Immediate resuscitation and management of hemorrhagic shock using blood products. Pelvic Binders : Applied at the level of the greater trochanters , not the iliac crest. Temporarily stabilizes the pelvis and reduces pelvic volume, limiting blood loss. Should not be left on for more than 24 hours due to the risk of pressure sores. May need to be loosened if over-reduced (excessive internal rotation of the hemipelvis). Reapplication is possible after checking pressure areas. Management of Hemorrhage : If the patient remains hemodynamically unstable despite a binder and resuscitation: Exclude other sources of bleeding (chest, abdomen, external). Two main options: Angiography and Embolization : Targets arterial bleeding, controls vessels like the internal iliac and superior gluteal arteries. Risks include muscle necrosis (gluteals). Pre-peritoneal Packing : Requires rapid application of an external fixator and abdominal packing (Stoppa approach). May be followed by angiography if needed. Conservative Management : Used for stable fractures such as avulsion fractures and LC I fractures. Early mobilization and partial weight-bearing are encouraged to avoid complications (e.g., VTE, chest infections). Operative Fixation : Converts unstable fractures to stable configurations using open reduction, internal fixation (plates, screws), or percutaneous iliosacral screws. Sacral fractures and sacroiliac dislocations may require closed or open reduction. Immediate surgery for internal fixation (Option A) : Immediate surgery for internal fixation is not the first step in trauma management. Stabilization and resuscitation are prioritized. Order a CT scan of the pelvis (Option C) : While imaging may be necessary, the immediate management should focus on",

        "C": "Superior pubic ligament",
        "D": "All of the above"
      },
      "correct_answer": "D",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: D) All of the above Explanation: Sacro-iliac ligament, Ilio-lumbar ligament, and Superior pubic ligament– all of these ligaments work together to reinforce the pelvic ring, enhance stability, and protect against injuries, particularly during movements or forces applied to the pelvis. Thus, all are essential for pelvic stability. Pelvis Anatomy Pelvic ring is a ring-shaped structure. Front: joined by pubic symphysis. Back: joined by sacro-iliac joints. Features iliac wings, a common fracture site. Continuity: pubic symphysis → pubic crest → pectineal line of pubis → arcuate line of ilium → ala and promontory of sacrum. Anterior fractures may involve posterior injuries, causing instability. Obturator nerve and sacral plexus cross the pelvic brim. These nerves are at risk of injury during pelvic fractures. Stability of the Pelvis Stability depends on: Posteriorly: sacro-iliac joints. Anteriorly: symphysis pubis. Sacro-iliac joints supported by strong sacro-iliac ligaments, ilio-lumbar, sacro-tuberous, and sacro-spinous ligaments. Pubic symphysis reinforced by superior pubic ligament and the arcuate pubic ligament. Mechanism of the Injury Low energy injuries Result from sudden muscular contractions in young athletes that cause an avulsion injury. Low energy fall in an elderly with osteoporosis which may fracture the pelvic bones. High energy injuries: Most common RTA Fall from heights.

Explanation: The Ilizarov technique is versatile and can be used for multiple purposes such as correcting deformities , not just limb lengthening. Key points on Ilizarov technique: The Ilizarov technique is mainly used for management of difficult non-unions and limb lengthening . It's based on the principle that osteogenesis requires a dynamic state, achieved through controlled distraction or compression . (Option B) Intramembranous Ossification: This is the primary method of bone formation during distraction osteogenesis. Osteoblasts directly form bone without an intermediate cartilage stage (unlike endochondral ossification, seen in long bone growth). The technique uses a ring fixator that stabilizes the limb while allowing controlled movement of bone fragments. (Option A) Distraction or compression is typically done at a rate of 1 mm per day , in four 0.25 mm increments. (Option C) First corticotomy is done to expose the metaphyseal bone. Then 10 days are given for a latent period for hematoma formation. The technique is effective for: Limb lengthening, especially when shortening is associated with deformity.

      "explanation": "Correct Answer: B) Hematoma formation, Inflammation, Callus formation, Remodeling, Modeling lasts up to 7 days . Blood leaks from torn vessels and forms a hematoma around the fracture. The periosteum and soft tissues are stripped away from the fracture ends. Fracture ends suffer from ischemic necrosis over a few millimeters. Some osteocytes die, while others become active and help in healing. Stage of granulation tissue The granulation tissue stage lasts 2-3 weeks . Precursor cells produce blood vessels, fibroblasts, and osteoblasts. Soft granulation tissue forms between fracture fragments. It provides support without structural rigidity. A fibrous mesh from the blood clot supports fibroblast and capillary growth. Macrophages and giant cells remove the blood clot. In bone healing, granulation tissue differentiates into osteoblasts to form new bone. Stage of callus This stage lasts 4-12 weeks, during which granulation tissue differentiates into osteoblasts. These cells create an intercellular matrix that becomes impregnated with calcium salts, forming the callus, or woven bone. This callus, visible on X-rays about 3 weeks post-fracture, provides initial strength and indicates union. Stage of remodeling Formerly known as the consolidation stage. Woven bone is replaced by mature lamellar bone. This occurs in multicellular units, with callus replaced by lamellar bone. The process is slow, taking 1 to 4 years. Stage of modeling Formerly known as the remodeling stage. Bone is gradually strengthened. Cortices sharpen at the endosteal and periosteal surfaces. Local bone strains from weight-bearing stresses and muscle forces stimulate this process. More noticeable in children with angulated fractures. Limited remodeling occurs in adult fractures. fracture healing\" data-author=\"\" data-hash=\"8372\" data-license=\"\" data-source=\"\" data-tags=\"April2025\" src=\"https://image.prepladder.com/notes/PXXQgntf1zwdA7EMjU7m1744216222.png\" />",

      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "secondary healing is a process involving callus formation and occurs with relative stability. Correct Answer: B) Primary healing occurs with absolute stability and direct bone remodeling, while secondary healing is a process involving callus formation and occurs with relative stability. Explanation: Primary healing requires absolute stability (surgical fixation) and healing occurs without a callus. Secondary healing occurs with relative stability (e.g., casting) and involves callus formation. Feature Primary (Direct) Healing Secondary (Indirect) Healing Process Direct bone healing without callus formation. (Option A) Involves the classical stages of healing: hematoma, callus formation, and remodeling. Mechanism Lamellar bone forms directly across the fracture line by direct extension of osteons . Healing occurs through endochondral and intramembranous ossification with callus formation. Fracture Hematoma Occurs when the fracture hematoma is disturbed , usually in surgically treated fractures. (Option D) Occurs when the fracture hematoma remains undisturbed , typical of non-operative treatment. Callus Formation No callus formation ; difficult to evaluate on X-rays due to direct healing. Callus formation is visible on X-rays and bridges the fracture site. Stability Requirement Requires absolute stability with rigid internal fixation (e.g., surgical plates). Requires relative stability , often managed with casting or external fixation. Healing Speed Slower healing due to the direct remodeling of bone. (Option C) Faster healing, as callus provides early mechanical strength. Mechanical Continuity Mechanical continuity is reestablished without callus formation . Strength is restored by the callus , which provides initial stability. Bone Contact Direct contact between bone cortices (anatomical reduction). Gaps between bone fragments are bridged by callus formation. Clinical Use Used in surgically treated fractures requiring perfect alignment. Common in non-surgically treated fractures (e.g., casting, external fixation). X-ray Evaluation Hard to evaluate healing on X-rays due to lack of callus formation. Callus formation makes healing progress visible on X-rays .",

        "D": "Developmental dysplasia of the hip"
      },
      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: C) Slipped capital femoral epiphysis Explanation: The patient's presentation aligns with slipped capital femoral epiphysis based on the clinical features. SCFE occurs when the femoral head becomes displaced due to slippage at the growth plate, often linked to factors such as mechanical stress and hormonal influences during periods of rapid growth. This displacement leads to altered hip mechanics and can cause pain, limited mobility, and long-term joint complications if not addressed. SCFE presents with the following characteristics: Age: 13 years old, which falls within the typical age range for SCFE (12-14 years) Gender: Male, which is more common in SCFE Body habitus: Obese, a known risk factor for SCFE Symptoms: Gradual onset of hip and knee pain with a limp Physical examination: External rotation of the affected leg, limited hip internal rotation, and abduction Associated with Hypothyroidism and Hypogonadism. Fig. Plain X-ray of Slipped capital femoral epiphysis Slipped capital femoral epiphysis (SCFE) Definition Displacement of the upper femoral epiphysis at the growth plate, usually postero-medially, resulting in coxa vara Age & Gender Occurs at puberty (between 12-14 years) More common in boys Risk Factors Obesity Endocrine abnormalities Short and obese children Clinical Features Pain in the groin, often radiating to the thigh and knee Limp External rotation of the affected leg, Shortening of the limb. Limitation of hip movements, especially abduction and internal rotation Positive Trendelenburg's sign Drehmann's Sign is characterized by external rotation and abduction of the hip when the knee is flexed, indicating instability or weakness in the hip joint Radiological Features Best seen on the X-ray: lateral view of the hip AP view: Growth plate displaced towards metaphyseal side Lateral view: Head is angulated on the neck Klein's Line: This is an imaging line drawn on an X-ray of the hip, where a line is drawn along the superior aspect of the femoral neck. The line should intersect the capital femoral epiphysis. If the epiphysis is above this line, it indicates a potential displacement or abnormality in the femoral head. Trethowan Sign: This sign is observed on an X-ray when there is a widening of the medial joint space of the hip, indicating a possible displacement of the femoral head. It may also suggest a higher likelihood of osteonecrosis in the affected hip. Treatment Acute slip: Closed reduction and pinning Gradual slip: Depends on severity; in situ fixation or corrective osteotomy Prophylactic pinning of unaffected side in unilateral cases Legg-Calvé-Perthes disease typically affects younger children (4-10 years) and typically presents with limping, hip or knee pain, reduced hip mobility, and possible leg length discrepancy in children aged 4-10 years. In Legg-Calvé-Perthes disease, decreased movements typically include hip abduction, internal rotation, external rotation, and flexion. (Option A) Septic arthritis of the hip usually has an acute onset with fever and severe pain, which is not described in this case.",

      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: C) Atrophy of the thenar eminence Explanation: The patient's symptoms of tingling and numbness in the thumb, index, and middle fingers , worsening at night are classic signs of carpal tunnel syndrome . Atrophy of the thenar eminence indicates significant nerve dysfunction and is commonly seen in advanced cases of carpal tunnel syndrome. Carpal tunnel syndrome Definition Compression of the median nerve as it passes through the carpal tunnel in the wrist Symptoms Numbness, tingling in thumb, index, and middle fingers Pain in hand and wrist Weakness in grip Symptoms often worse at night and improve during the day. Advanced cases may lead to constant symptoms, hand weakness, clumsiness, and muscle atrophy. Structures Affected Median Nerve : Compressed within the carpal tunnel, leading to symptoms and signs. Flexor Tendons : The nine flexor tendons passing through the carpal tunnel can become inflamed, further compressing the median nerve. Structures Spared Thenar Eminence : Sensory loss generally spares this area because its nerve (palmar sensory cutaneous nerve) bypasses the carpal tunnel. Clinical Signs Weakness: Notable weakness in thumb abduction and opposition. (Option A) Atrophy : Possible atrophy of the thenar eminence in advanced cases. Sensory Loss : Loss typically affects the median nerve distribution (thumb, index, middle, and radial half of the fourth digit).
