        "A": "Autosomal dominant",
        "B": "Autosomal recessive",
        "C": "X-linked dominant",
        "D": "X-linked recessive"
      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: B) Autosomal recessive Explanation: MEOX1-related Klippel-Feil syndrome follows an autosomal recessive inheritance pattern. Klippel-Feil syndrome: Congenital disorder characterized by the abnormal fusion of two or more cervical vertebrae resulting in shortened neck. Short neck Low hairline Restricted neck movement Samartzis classification of Klippel-Feil syndrome Types Description Type I Single, congenitally fused segment. About 25% of the patients. Type II Multiple, non contiguous, congenitally fused segment. About 50% of the patients. Type III Multiple, contiguous, congenitally fused segment. About 25% of the patients. Etiology Can result from mutations in genes like GDF6, GDF3 or MEOX1. Inheritance can be autosomal dominant (M/C- GDF3,GDF6) or autosomal recessive (MEOX1 mutations). Also associated with fetal alcohol syndrome, Goldenhar syndrome and Sprengel deformity. Sprengel deformity or Congenital elevation of the scapula is an anomaly of the shoulder girdle that is associated with abnormal descent, and altered position and anatomy of the scapula.The deformity is usually associated with muscle hypoplasia or atrophy. The MEOX1 gene encodes the homeobox protein MOX1 , which regulates vertebral separation. Pathophysiology Faulty cervical spine segmentation occurs during 3-8 weeks of embryonic development resulting in persistent fusion of involved vertebrae. Complications Risk of spinal cord injury due to instability. Hearing loss Scoliosis Disc degeneration Spondylosis Spinal canal stenosis Disc herniation Osteophyte formation Differential diagnosis Various congenital conditions may present similar to neonatal Klippel-Feil syndrome such as: Mayer-Rokitansky-Kuster-Hauser syndrome VACTERL - Vertebral defect, Anal atresia, Cardiac defect, Tracheoesophageal fistula, renal and limb defects.

      },
      "correct_answer": "D",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: D) Klippel-Feil syndrome Explanation: This patient presents with the hallmark features of Klippel-Feil syndrome , including Short neck Low hairline Restricted neck movement Cervical vertebral fusion (C2-C3) Klippel-Feil syndrome: Congenital disorder characterized by the abnormal fusion of two or more cervical vertebrae resulting in shortened neck. Clinical features Triad of Short neck, Limited neck mobility, Low posterior hairline. Scoliosis, hearing loss, or other organ anomalies. Facial dysmorphism Microcephaly Abnormal sensorimotor function and reflexes. Diagnosis Ultrasonography: Detecting cervical vertebral fusion and associated cardiac, renal and gastrointestinal anomalies. Plain Radiography: Assess the extent of cervical vertebral fusion. CT scan: For detection of bony fusion. MRI: Used for evaluating the integrity of spinal cord, disc space and nerve rootlets. Genetic testing Treatment Most patients receive non-operative treatment except in cases of acute neurological deficits, cervical instability. Non operative management Physical therapy Pain management Operative management Anterior approach: Anterior cervical fusion or corpectomy with synthetic or bone graft placement. Cervical total disc arthroplasty Posterior approach: Decompression and fusion Surgical or bracing intervention may be necessary for associated compensatory thoracic scoliosis . Patients with hearing impairment may require otolaryngological evaluation. Complications Risk of spinal cord injury due to instability. Hearing loss Scoliosis Disc degeneration Spondylosis Spinal canal stenosis Disc herniation Osteophyte formation Differential diagnosis Various congenital conditions may present similar to neonatal Klippel-Feil syndrome such as: Mayer-Rokitansky-Kuster-Hauser syndrome VACTERL - Vertebral defect, Anal atresia, Cardiac defect, Tracheoesophageal fistula, renal and limb defects. Wildervanck syndrome VACTERL association (Option A): Vertebral defects, Anal atresia, Cardiac defects, Tracheoesophageal fistula, Renal anomalies, and Limb abnormalities. It is a collection of birth defects that typically occur together, but this patient only has vertebral issues (fusion), making VACTERL less likely. Wildervanck syndrome (Option B): Involves the triad of Klippel-Feil syndrome (vertebral fusion), Duane retraction syndrome (eye movement abnormalities), and sensorineural hearing loss. The absence of ocular and hearing abnormalities in this patient makes this diagnosis less likely. Mayer-Rokitansky-Küster-Hauser (MRKH) syndrome (Option C): Characterized by congenital absence of the uterus and upper part of the vagina.It primarily involves the reproductive system, without vertebral or neck abnormalities, which makes it unrelated to the presented symptoms",

      "question": "A 9-month-old infant is brought to the emergency department by their parents due to lethargy and vomiting. The parents claim the child fell from the couch the previous day. On examination, the child has multiple bruises of varying ages on the torso and arms, along with swelling over the left side of the head. A skeletal survey reveals posterior rib fractures and a healing spiral fracture of the left femur. Ophthalmologic examination shows retinal hemorrhages. What is the most likely diagnosis?",

        "D": "Vitamin D deficiency (Rickets)"
      },
      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: C) Battered baby syndrome Explanation: The clinical features strongly suggest battered baby syndrome (non-accidental injury) because of the following: Multiple bruises of varying ages Posterior rib fractures Spiral fracture of the femur Retinal hemorrhages Battered Baby Syndrome (also known as Non-Accidental Injury (NAI) or Child Physical Abuse) refers to a clinical condition in which an infant or young child has been physically abused, often repeatedly, by a parent or caregiver. Clinical Features Multiple injuries at different stages of healing. Bruises, fractures, burns, and lacerations, often in unusual places like the back, buttocks, or thighs. Rib fractures (posterior or lateral), long bone fractures (especially spiral fractures), and skull fractures. Retinal hemorrhages or subdural hematomas, often associated with shaken baby syndrome, a form of abusive head trauma. Fracture in metaphysis of bone Radiographic Findings Fractures of varying ages are highly suspicious (old healing fractures along with recent ones). Classic metaphyseal lesions (CML), often found in infants, are indicative of twisting or pulling forces. Posterior rib fractures suggest forceful squeezing. Skull fractures may be seen with head trauma. Signs of Abuse Inconsistent history provided by the caregiver. Delay in seeking medical care despite severe injuries. Injuries inconsistent with the child's developmental stage (e.g., infants with fractures who cannot yet walk). Associated Syndromes Shaken Baby Syndrome (SBS): A form of child abuse resulting in brain injury caused by violent shaking. It can lead to severe neurological damage or death. Munchausen Syndrome: A caregiver intentionally causes illness or injury in a child to gain attention. Diagnosis A thorough physical exam and detailed history are crucial. Imaging (X-rays, CT scans, MRI) to assess for fractures, brain injury, or internal trauma. Ophthalmologic exam to check for retinal hemorrhages. Management Immediate protection of the child by involving child protective services or law enforcement. Medical treatment for injuries, which may involve surgery, fracture management, or neurological intervention. Long-term psychological and social support for the child and non-abusive family members. Paget disease (Option A): Primarily affects older adults and involves abnormal bone remodeling, leading to enlarged and deformed bones. It does not typically present with multiple bruises or fractures in an infant. Osteogenesis imperfecta (Option B): This genetic condition leads to fragile bones but would not explain the specific pattern of bruising or retinal hemorrhages observed in the",

      "question": "A 2 Y/O boy is brought to the orthopedic clinic by his parents due to concerns about his right leg. They report that he has been walking with a noticeable limp and that his right tibia appears to be bowed. On examination, there is a palpable swelling along the midshaft of the right tibia, which is tender to touch. X-rays reveal a cystic lesion at the midshaft of the tibia with a lack of continuity in the bone. The child has no history of trauma. What is the most likely diagnosis?",

        "D": "Monostotic fibrous dysplasia"
      },
      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: C) Congenital pseudoarthrosis of the tibia Explanation: Congenital pseudoarthrosis of the tibia present with Bowed tibia and palpable swelling at the midshaft are characteristic signs. The cystic appearance on X-rays indicates a pseudoarthrosis, characterized by a nonunion or false joint in the bone. The lack of any history of trauma supports this diagnosis, as congenital pseudoarthrosis typically arises without prior injury. Congenital pseudoarthrosis of the tibia: Rare condition characterized as non union of tibial diaphyseal fracture that either develops spontaneously or after a history of trivial trauma in previously dysplastic segment of the bone. Associated with increased tendency to re-fracture. Considered one of the most commonly observed types of congenital pseudoarthrosis. Etiopathogenesis It may be related to factors such as genetic predisposition, vascular insufficiency, or trauma during fetal development. It is often associated with neurofibromatosis type I (NF1), a genetic disorder that can lead to tumors on nerve tissue and skeletal abnormalities. Increased osteoclastic activity due to signal abnormalities or decreased osteogenic potential of the bone due to defects in local vascularisation of the bone. Clinical Features Typically diagnosed in infancy or early childhood. Affected children may present with anterolateral bowing of tibia and an unstable or painful area in the midshaft of the tibia. There may be a noticeable lump or mass at the site of the pseudoarthrosis. Failure of the process of tubulation in early life. Cystic pre-fracture Diagnosis Standard roentgenogram: Advised as primary investigation which can show anterolateral bowing, heterogeneous lesions, resorption of the bone at the ends of fracture. X-rays typically show a characteristic cystic appearance at the site of the pseudoarthrosis with a lack of normal bone continuity. CT scans or MRI may be used for better visualization of the bone structure and surrounding tissues. Complications Recurrent fractures Limb length discrepancies Valgus deformity of the ankle Tibiotarsal instability Ankle stiffness Treatment Treatment options depend on the age of the child, the severity of the condition, and whether there is associated neurofibromatosis. Conservative treatment may include bracing or observation in mild cases. Surgical intervention is often required for more severe cases and may include: Intramedullary nailing along with bone graft Illizarov technique: Direct compression of the pseudoarthrosis area with or without its resection along with bone graft. Vascularized bone transfers Differential diagnosis Osteofibrous dysplasia of the long bones Congenital angulation of the tubular bones Monostotic fibrous dysplasia Osteofibrous dysplasia (Option A): This condition is a benign",

      "explanation": "Correct Answer: A) Blount Disease Explanation: Blount Disease is characterized by pathologic tibial varus deformity, often seen in young children, and is linked with abnormal growth of the medial part of the proximal tibial growth plate. Blount disease: Blount disease, also known as tibia vara, is an acquired genu varus deformity in children caused by disrupted normal cartilage growth at the proximal medial metaphysis of the tibia. This condition develops due to excessive compressive forces on the medial aspect of the proximal tibial physis, leading to altered enchondral bone formation. Etiopathogenesis: Genetic susceptibility Mechanical overloading of the tibia especially in children who are overweight and started walking earlier. Blount disease results from growth inhibition induced by excessive compressive forces, leading to cartilage damage and a subsequent delay in ossification. Mechanical overload leads to altered enchondral bone formation. Two forms of Blount disease Infantile Blount disease Adolescent Blount disease Diagnosed in children between age 1-3 years. Bilateral condition. Characterised by varus deformity of tibia with identification of lateral thrust. Emerges in children in their late childhood or early adolescent. Unilateral or bilateral conditions. Characterised by pain in the medial aspect of the knee. Diagnosis: Accurate measurement requires bilateral projection of the radiograph from the hip to the ankle. Angles for Blount disease detection Angles Description Metaphyseal-Diaphyseal angle(MDA) The intersection occurs between a line drawn from the most distal point on the medial and lateral beaks of the tibial metaphysis to a line perpendicular to the long axis of the tibial diaphysis. An angle >16° is associated with a 95% risk of deformity progression. An angle <10° is likely physiological, with a 95% chance of spontaneous resolution. An angle between 11° and 16° necessitates close observation for the potential tibia vara progression. Tibiofemoral angle Measures the severity of varus deformity. Medial Metaphyseal Beak angle(MMBA) Diagnostic screening tool for individual risk of blount disease. MRI effectively assesses cartilage, menisci, ligaments and vascularity of the physis. Differential Diagnosis: Physiological bowing of the legs Ollier disease Metaphyseal Chondrodysplasia Thrombocytopenia absent radius syndrome Treatment: Treatment of Blount's disease depends on the child's age and the severity of the deformity. Brace: KAFO are potential treatment options for children diagnosed before age 4. Guided growth or Hemiepiphysiodesis is a surgical technique designed to correct angular limb deformities in skeletally immature patients progressively. Osteotomy : Realignment osteotomy is typically performed before age",

      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: A) Perthes disease Explanation: Perthes disease, also known as Legg-Calvé-Perthes disease , is an idiopathic avascular necrosis of the femoral head that typically affects children between the ages of 4 and 10. Legg-Calvé-Perthes disease Description Idiopathic osteonecrosis or idiopathic avascular necrosis of the capital femoral epiphysis of the femoral head. Etiopathogenesis Idiopathic or etiology that would disrupt the blood flow to femoral epiphysis. Coagulopathy and steroid use. Includes 4 phases Necrosis : Disruption of the blood supply leads to infarction of the femoral capital epiphysis. Fragmentation : The body reabsorbs the infarcted bone. Reossification : Osteoblastic activity takes over, and the femoral epiphysis reestablishes. Remodeling : The new femoral head may be enlarged or flattened. It reshapes during growth. Risk factors Ten percent familial (there is a delayed bone age by about 2 years) HIV (Up to 5% of HIV patients have avascular necrosis of the hip) Factor V Leiden Thrombophilias (increased clotting) Hypofibrinolysis (decreased ability to dissolve clots) Secondhand smoke exposure Low socioeconomic status Birth weight less than 2.5 kg in boys Short stature Clinical features Limp of acute or insidious onset, usually painless. If pain is present, it is localized to the hip or knee. Decreased internal rotation and abduction of hip. Atrophy of thighs and buttocks. Leg length discrepancy. Antalgic gait in acute cases Trendelenburg gait in chronic cases Diagnosis Standard anteroposterior pelvis and frog-leg lateral (Lauenstein) views. Bone scan or MRI Early findings: Widening of joint space (epiphyseal cartilage hypertrophy) Changes in the epiphysis. Crescent sign: Subchondral radiolucent zone of the anterolateral epiphysis Late signs: Flattening of the femoral head. Bone scan shows decreased perfusion to the femoral head. Differential diagnosis Transient synovitis Multiple epiphyseal dysplasia (MED) Spondyloepiphyseal dysplasia (SED) Gaucher disease Hypothyroidism Meyer dysplasia Treatment Non operative: Indicated for children with bone age less than 6 or lateral pillar A involvement. Activity restriction and protective weight-bearing are recommended until ossification is complete. Operative treatment: Femoral or Pelvic Osteotomy indicated in children older than 8 years. Valgus or Shelf Osteotomies indicated in children with hinge abduction Hip Arthroscopy Complications Coxa magna: Widening of the femoral head. Coda plans: Flattening of the femoral head. Gaucher disease (Option B) : A lysosomal storage disorder that may affect the bones but usually presents with hepatosplenomegaly and other systemic signs. Meyer's dysplasia (Option C): A benign condition that affects the growing hip joint, but it typically",
