      "question": "A 34-year-old woman complains of difficulty walking. She notices her right hip drops when she steps on her left leg, and she has to lean her body to the left to maintain balance. She has a history of hip dysplasia. Examination shows weakness in the left hip abductors. Which of the following gait types does this best represent?",
      "options": {
        "A": "Scissoring Gait",
        "B": "Trendelenburg Gait",
        "C": "Antalgic Gait",
        "D": "Short Limb Gait"
      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: B) Trendelenburg Gait Explanation: Trendelenburg gait is characterized by the dropping of the pelvis on the contralateral side due to weakness of the hip abductor muscles (primarily the gluteus medius and minimus) on the stance leg. In this case, the right hip drops when the patient stands on her left leg, indicating weakness in the left hip abductors. Bilateral Trendelenburg gait is called a Waddling gait . Abnormal Gait types Antalgic Gait (Option C) Characterised by a markedly shortened stance phase on the affected side. Pain prompts the patient to shift body weight quickly to the normal leg. Results in reduced time spent on the affected leg. Short Limb Gait (Option D) Apparent when the limb is shorter than 2 inches. The body on the affected side moves up and down with weight bearing on the affected leg. It can be due to a congenital short femur or shortening secondary to fracture. Trendelenburg Gait The body swings to the affected side when weight is borne. Indicates functionally weak hip abductor muscles. Associated conditions include a dislocated hip, congenital coxa vara, DDH, greater trochanter fracture and fractured neck of the femur. High stepping Gait Occurs due to foot drop; the leg is lifted higher for clearance. First contact with the ground is made by the forefoot rather than the heel. Commonly seen in peroneal nerve palsy or sciatic nerve palsy . Hand on knee Gait The individual walks with their hand on the knee to prevent buckling. Typically associated with quadriceps deficiency and flexion deformity. Common in polio patients. Quadriceps Avoidance Gait Characterised by hyperextension of the knee to lock it. Compensates for quadriceps paralysis. Scissoring Gait (Option A) Legs cross in front of each other while walking. Caused by spasms of the hip adductors, often associated with cerebral palsy. Results in a stiff-legged appearance. Reference: Apley and Solomon’s System of Orthopaedics and Trauma, 10th Edition, Page. 234 Essential Orthopaedics, J. Maheshwari, 5th Edition, Page.347 Waddling gait",

      "question": "Which of the following locations is the most common site for a ganglion cyst on the wrist?",
      "options": {
        "A": "Volar aspect near the radial artery",
        "B": "Dorsal side of the scapholunate ligament",
        "C": "Over the second carpometacarpal joint",
        "D": "Palmar side of the scaphoid-trapezium-trapezoid joint"
      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Correct answer: B) Dorsal side of the scapholunate ligament Explanation: The dorsal side of the scapholunate ligament is the most common site for ganglion cysts around the wrist. Ganglion cysts are benign, fluid-filled cysts commonly found around the wrist, and are usually caused by leakage of synovial fluid from a joint or tendon sheath. Treatment Options : Observation: Many resolve spontaneously. Aspiration: Fluid removal for symptom relief. Surgery: Reserved for cases with significant pain or nerve compression; recurrence is possible. Steroid injection: Useful for small, hidden ganglia or cases with synovial impingement. Volar aspect near the radial artery (Option A): While volar ganglia do occur, this is a less common location compared to the dorsal side. Over the second carpometacarpal joint (Option C): This location is more typical for a carpometacarpal boss, not a ganglion cyst. Palmar side of the scaphoid-trapezium-trapezoid joint (Option D): This is another location for ganglion cysts, but it is less common than the dorsal side.

      "question": "A 55 y/o woman with a 15-year history of poorly controlled diabetes presents with stiffness and reduced movement in her fingers, primarily on the ulnar side. Which clinical sign is specific to this condition?",
      "options": {
        "A": "Table top sign",
        "B": "Tinel’s sign",
        "C": "Kanavel’s sign",
        "D": "Finkelstein’s test"
      },
      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "Correct answer: A) Tabletop sign Explanation: The \"tabletop sign\" occurs when a patient is unable to place their palms and fingers flat on a surface due to limited joint mobility. This is a hallmark of diabetic cheiroarthropathy , which is characterized by restricted movement in the hands, often starting on the ulnar side and progressing radially. It reflects the thickening and stiffening of the connective tissues around the joints, a common finding in long-standing diabetes. Tinel’s sign (Option B): Tinel’s sign is used to diagnose carpal tunnel syndrome. Tapping over the median nerve in the wrist produces tingling or \"pins and needles\" in the hand and fingers, which is indicative of nerve compression. Kanavel’s sign (Option C): Kanavel’s sign refers to symptoms observed in flexor tenosynovitis, where the finger is held in a flexed position, and there is tenderness along the flexor tendon sheath. This is not seen in diabetic cheiroarthropathy. Finkelstein’s test (Option D): Finkelstein’s test is used to diagnose de Quervain’s tenosynovitis, a condition affecting the tendons on the thumb side of the wrist.

      "question": "A 45 y/o male presents with redness, swelling, and pain in the thumb after sustaining a puncture wound two days ago. The thumb is held in a flexed position, and the patient experiences severe pain when attempting to straighten it. There is also swelling over the thenar eminence. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?",
      "options": {
        "A": "Apply a splint and prescribe oral antibiotics",
        "B": "Immediate surgical drainage",
        "C": "Initiate intravenous antibiotics and monitor for 24 hours",
        "D": "Request an X-ray to confirm the diagnosis"
      },
      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Correct answer: C) Initiate intravenous antibiotics and monitor for 24 hours Explanation: The clinical features point to Suppurative tenosynovitis. It is the infection of the flexor tendon sheath in the hand, typically following a penetrating injury. Prompt initiation of intravenous antibiotics is critical to control the infection and prevent complications like tendon necrosis and spread to nearby structures (e.g., radial or ulnar bursa). Commonly used antibiotics include broad-spectrum penicillin or systemic cephalosporins, which target likely organisms such as Staphylococcus aureus. Apply a splint and prescribe oral antibiotics (Option A): While splinting is helpful to immobilize the affected finger and reduce pain, oral antibiotics are generally inadequate in severe infections like suppurative tenosynovitis. The infection can rapidly worsen, leading to complications such as tendon necrosis or vascular occlusion. Immediate surgical drainage (Option B): Surgical drainage is not the first-line treatment in all cases. Early suppurative tenosynovitis can often be managed with IV antibiotics if initiated promptly. Surgical drainage is reserved for cases where there is no response to antibiotics within 24 hours. Request an X-ray to confirm the diagnosis (Option D): The diagnosis of suppurative tenosynovitis is primarily clinical , based on the classic signs like Kanavel’s signs (flexed posture of the digit, tenderness along the tendon sheath, pain with passive extension). X-rays are generally not useful for diagnosing soft tissue infections like tenosynovitis, Reference: Apley and Solomon’s System of Orthopaedics and Trauma, 10th Edition, Page 449",

      "question": "A 25 y/o patient presents with a complex open fracture of the leg after a motor vehicle accident. The fracture has significant bone loss and the patient is seeking treatment options. The orthopaedic surgeon discusses two potential methods: the Ilizarov fixator and the rail fixator. Which of the following statements is true regarding the treatment options for this patient?",
      "options": {
        "A": "The Ilizarov fixator is not suitable for limb lengthening or deformity corrections.",
        "B": "The rail fixator does not require daily adjustments by the patient or family member.",
        "C": "In the Ilizarov fixator only the cortex of the bone is cut, preserving periosteum.",
        "D": "The rail fixator is superior to the Ilizarov fixator in treating complex fractures."
      },
      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: C) In the Ilizarov fixator only the cortex of the bone is cut, preserving the periosteum. Explanation: The Ilizarov fixator does carry a risk of pin tract infections, but it is highly effective for managing both infected and uninfected nonunions, addressing all aspects of the condition. Ring fixator/ Illizarov Fixator Principles of Ilizarov’s Method Distraction Osteogenesis (Law of Tension Force): Pulling living tissue apart at 1 mm/day creates new tissue. A multilevel, multidirectional, multiplanar external fixator is superior to others. Corticotomy: Only the cortex of the bone is cut, preserving periosteum and intramedullary circulation for better new bone quality. (Option C) Indications for Ilizarov's Method Complex Fractures: Effective for open, comminuted, and intra-articular fractures. Compound Fractures: Useful for fractures with bone loss; allows mobilization of bone to cover gaps through distraction. Nonunion: Excellent for managing both infected and uninfected nonunions, addressing all aspects of the condition. Limb Lengthening: Applicable in cases like achondroplasia and other limb shortenings. Deformity Corrections: Effective for corrections due to conditions like polio and cerebral palsy. (Option A ruled out) Disadvantages Long duration of treatment. Risks of pin tract infection and nerve palsy. Potential for joint stiffness. Rail Fixator Consist of a straight bar placed on one side of the limb (arm, leg, or foot). Connected to the bone by screws, often coated with hydroxyapatite for better grip. Prevents screw loosening. Requires patient or family member adjustments several times a day by turning knobs. (Option B) The rail fixator is superior to the Ilizarov fixator in treating complex fractures. (Option D): While the rail fixator has its advantages, the Ilizarov fixator is specifically designed to address complex fractures, including open and comminuted types, making it a preferred choice in many cases.",

      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: B) Periosteal elevator Explanation: Instrument Description Periosteal Elevator (Option B) Used to elevate the periosteum during bone operations. Elevating the periosteum allows access to important structures like vessels, nerves, and tendons. Muscles of the extremity are attached to the periosteum and are lifted with it. Not used in some procedures, such as the excision of osteochondroma, where the periosteum is removed completely to prevent recurrence. Osteotome (Option C) Used for osteotomy, which involves cutting a bone. Both edges of the osteotome are bevelled. Available in different blade widths. Commonly used for procedures like McMurray’s osteotomy for the neck of femur fractures and corrective osteotomies for deformities such as genu varum and genu valgum. Bohler’s Stirrup (Option A) A device used for holding a Steinmann pin and applying traction. Side screws secure the pin in place. Allows for changing the direction of traction without moving the pin inside the bone. Helps avoid loosening of the pin during traction adjustments.",

      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: A) Austin-Moore Prosthesis Explanation: Austin-Moore Prosthesis is specifically designed for elderly patients with fractures involving the neck of the femur and is suitable given this patient’s poor general health. Hip Prosthesis Used to replace the head of the femur following nonunion and avascular necrosis due to a fracture of the neck of the femur. Advantages Early mobilisation of patients. Reduces complications such as avascular necrosis, nonunion, and fixation failure. Indications (9 Ps) Poor general health Pathological fracture Porosis (osteoporosis) Pauwels type III fracture Physiological age (60 years and above ) Paraplegia and paresis Paget's disease Primary internal fixation failure Poor union (nonunion and delayed union) Types of Hip Prostheses 1. Austin-Moore Prosthesis: Used to replace the femoral head in elderly patients with neck of femur fractures. Features a small neck and stem, with head sizes ranging from 35 to 59 mm (odd numbers). Includes a hole at the top of the stem for extractor use. Has two fenestrations for bone growth to aid fixation. Designed for use without cement to facilitate easier removal. 2. Thompson Prosthesis: Similar to the Austin-Moore prosthesis. Indicated for cases where the neck of the femur is absorbed (e.g., old fractures). Can be used with or without cement. Austin-Moore Prosthesis Thompson Prosthesis 3. Charnley's Total Hip Prosthesis: Replaces both the acetabulum and the femoral head. Features a polyethylene acetabulum cup and a steelhead component (22 mm diameter). Fixed to the bones using bone cement (Polymethylmethacrylate). 4. Muller's Total Hip Prosthesis: Similar to Charnley’s prosthesis but with a larger head size of 32 mm. The stem is available in different thicknesses. Thompson Prosthesis (Option B): While it could be an option for absorbed neck fractures, it is not as tailored for elderly patients as the Austin-Moore prosthesis in this scenario. Charnley's Total Hip Prosthesis (Option C): This is more invasive as it replaces both the acetabulum and femoral head, which may not be necessary for this patient. Muller's Total Hip Prosthesis (Option D): Similar to Charnley’s, this option may not be ideal for her given her age and overall health concerns.",

      },
      "correct_answer": "D",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: D) Proceed with open A1 pulley release surgery. Explanation: Open A1 pulley release surgery is the gold standard for irreducibly locked trigger thumbs, especially after failed conservative treatments. Trigger Finger Management Non- operative Surgical NSAIDs: Used for pain relief and reducing inflammation Steroid Injections: Effective initial treatment, especially in the early stages. It is cost-effective and provides quick relief. However, it is often only a temporary solution. Splinting: Blocks MCP joint at 10-15° flexion for 6-10 weeks. Suitable for early-stage cases but less effective for severe or prolonged symptoms. Indications for Surgery: Failure of non-surgical treatments (steroid injections, splinting). Irreducibly locked trigger finger. Congenital trigger thumb with fixed flexion deformity. Open A1 Pulley Release: Gold standard; success rates up to 97%. Recommended for advanced cases and those unresponsive to conservative methods. Percutaneous Release: Effective but riskier for thumb due to proximity of digital nerve. Less favourable for index, middle, or ring fingers due to higher failure rates. Continue conservative management with NSAIDs and splinting (Option A): Continuing conservative management with NSAIDs and splinting is unlikely to resolve the irreducibly locked trigger thumb after failed conservative treatment. Administering a third steroid injection (Option B) is not recommended; the patient has already received two steroid injections without significant relief, making further injections inappropriate. Perform percutaneous release of the A1 pulley (Option C) is less favourable due to the involvement of the trigger thumb. The proximity of the digital nerve to the A1 pulley in the thumb increases the risk of nerve injury during percutaneous release.

Trigger finger Also known as digital tenovaginosis is a condition in which a flexor tendon may become trapped by thickening at the entrance to its sheath, which on forced extension passes the constriction with a snap (“triggering”). Trigger finger Aetiology of Trigger Finger Comorbid Diseases in Adults : Diabetes, Amyloidosis, Carpal tunnel syndrome, Gout, Thyroid disease, Rheumatoid arthritis Traumatic Forces Idiopathic Cases : Most childhood cases are idiopathic. Associated Conditions in Children : Congenital metabolic conditions (e.g., Hurler syndrome) and Inflammatory conditions (e.g., juvenile rheumatoid arthritis) Pathophysiology of Trigger Finger Inflammation and Hypertrophy : Inflammation and hypertrophy of the retinacular sheath restrict the motion of the flexor tendon. Pulley System : The retinacular sheath acts as a pulley system; the first annular pulley (A1) at the metacarpal head is the most commonly affected. Mechanical Stress : High forces during grip activities, resulting in repeated friction and tendon swelling. Layer Structure of A1 Pulley : Outer Layer : Vascularized and continuous with the tendon sheath. First Inner Layer : Avascular and contains cartilage-like cells. Second Inner Layer : Avascular and composed of spindle-shaped fibroblasts and regular collagenous bundles. A1 Pulley system All pulley system Pathological Transformation : In moderate trigger finger, the inner fibrocartilage thins and is replaced by fibrous tissue Tendon rupture (Option A): This condition typically presents with acute pain and significant functional loss but is less likely to cause the characteristic catching or locking sensation described in the trigger finger. Osteoarthritis (Option C): This condition often presents with joint pain and stiffness but typically does not cause the catching or locking sensation seen in the trigger finger. Carpal tunnel syndrome (Option D): While this condition can cause hand and finger symptoms, it primarily affects sensation and motor function in the thumb, index, and middle fingers rather than causing the flexion issue seen in the trigger finger.",

The physician performs a test where she lies supine on the table, and one of her hips is extended while the other knee is flexed to stabilize the pelvis. She experiences significant pain during this manoeuvre. Which test was performed to assess for sacroiliac joint involvement?",

      },
      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Correct answer: C) Gaenslen’s test Explanation: Tests for Ankylosing spondylitis (AS) Wall Test (Option B) Used to assess spinal extension limitations. The patient stands with their back against a wall, attempting to touch their heels, buttocks, scapulae, and the back of the head (occiput) to the wall. Difficulty in touching all these points simultaneously indicates a reduction in spinal extension, a common finding in AS. Schober Test (Option D) Measures the flexion of the lumbar spine. Two marks are placed on the patient's back: one at the posterior superior iliac spine level and another 10 cm above it. The patient bends forward, and the increase in distance between the two marks is measured. A small increase in distance suggests reduced lumbar flexion, which is a characteristic of AS. Schober test Gaenslen’s Test (Option C) Assesses sacroiliac joint involvement, which is frequently affected in AS. The patient lies on their back, with one hip and knee flexed to stabilize the pelvis. The other hip is then hyperextended over the edge of the table. If this manoeuvre exerts rotational strain over the sacroiliac joint, causing pain. It indicates inflammation or irritation of the sacroiliac joint. Gaenslen test Straight Leg Raising Test Though primarily used to assess lumbosacral root tension, this test can also help in identifying sacroiliac joint issues. The patient lies supine and is asked to lift one leg with the knee extended. Pain occurring during this test can be due to involvement of the sacroiliac joint in AS. Pump-handle Test Another test that evaluates sacroiliac joint pain. The patient lies on their back, and the examiner fully flexes the hip and knee of one leg. The knee is then forced towards the opposite shoulder, placing pressure on the sacroiliac joint. Pain triggered by this movement indicates sacroiliac joint inflammation or dysfunction, common in AS. Fleche Test (Option A) Designed to detect early involvement of the cervical spine in AS. The patient stands with their back against the wall and attempts to touch the back of their head to the wall without lifting their chin. The inability to do so suggests reduced cervical spine mobility, which can be an early sign of AS affecting the upper spine.",

      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Correct answer: B) Diclofenac Explanation: The clinical scenario points to a diagnosis of ankylosing spondylitis (AS). Diclofenac (NSAID) is first-line therapy for controlling pain and stiffness in ankylosing spondylitis, helping patients engage in physical activity and improve their overall function. Treatment of Ankylosing Spondylitis (AS) General Measures : Encourage regular physical activity. Teach maintenance of satisfactory posture and recommend daily spinal extension exercises. Avoid rest and immobilisation, which can increase stiffness. Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory Drugs (NSAIDs) : Help control pain and soft-tissue stiffness. Allow patients to benefit from exercise and activity. TNF Inhibitors : Target underlying inflammatory processes in AS. Generally reserved for patients not responding to NSAIDs. Includes infliximab, adalimumab, certolizumab, etanercept, and golimumab. Interleukin inhibitors: IL-17 inhibitors like Secukinumab and ixekizumab. Surgical Interventions : Only limited role. Joint replacement for significantly damaged hips (moderate mobility gains). Increased risk of infection and prolonged rehabilitation may be required. Lumbar or cervical osteotomy for severe spinal deformities (rarely needed due to improved activity and exercise programs). Hip replacements may suffice if spinal deformity is combined with hip stiffness, allowing full extension. Joint replacement (Option A): This is reserved for patients with significant joint damage and is not a first-line treatment for managing early symptoms of ankylosing spondylitis. TNF Inhibitors (Option C): While effective for targeting inflammation in cases unresponsive to NSAIDs, they are generally not the first choice for initial treatment, especially in newly diagnosed patients. Spinal immobilisation (Option D): This is counterproductive in ankylosing spondylitis as it can lead to increased stiffness. Regular movement and exercise are encouraged to maintain flexibility and posture.

      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Correct answer: B) Squaring of vertebrae Explanation: Squaring of vertebrae (flattening of the normal anterior concavity of the vertebra) is a key radiological feature of ankylosing spondylitis, caused by inflammation and erosion at the attachment points of ligaments, leading to a flattened appearance of the vertebral bodies. X-ray Findings of Ankylosing Spondylitis Squaring of vertebra and syndesmophytes Bamboo spine appearance Squaring of anterior vertebral margins due to osteitis of anterior corners. Diffuse syndesmophytic ankylosis Dagger spine Sacroiliitis Seen only in AP view Linear ossification of the interspinous ligament in the central spine. Bilateral sacroiliac joint erosions and sclerosis. Joint is ill-defined bilaterally. The \"trolley-track sign\" occurs due to the ossification of the ligaments along with the apophyseal joint capsules, resulting in three vertical radiodense lines visible on frontal imaging. Clinical Features of Ankylosing Spondylitis Onset and Age Early Symptoms Established Disease Symptoms Postural Changes Commonly begins in young adults, typically between ages 15-25. More prevalent in males than females. Insidious onset of chronic back pain and stiffness. Morning stiffness lasting over an hour and stiffness after inactivity. Possible referred pain in the buttocks and thighs, sometimes confused with sciatica. Continuous pain and stiffness General fatigue. Joint pain and swelling. Tenderness at the Achilles tendon insertion. Intercostal pain and tenderness. Decreased chest expansion Enthesitis Reduced lumbar lordosis (normal inward curve of the lower back). Increased thoracic kyphosis (outward curve of the upper back). Forward thrust of the neck, with compensatory hip and knee flexion. Extraarticular manifestations Uveitis, aortic valve disease, carditis, pulmonary fibrosis, osteoporosis, inflammatory bowel disease, psoriasis, renal abnormalities Joint effusion (Option A): Joint effusion is often seen in inflammatory arthritis but is not a primary feature of ankylosing spondylitis on X-ray. Instead, AS typically shows changes related to bone and joint structure rather than fluid accumulation. Osteophyte formation (Option C): Osteophytes are bony growths typically associated with osteoarthritis and are not characteristic of ankylosing spondylitis. Cartilage loss (Option D): While cartilage loss occurs in various forms of arthritis, it is not specifically a hallmark finding in ankylosing spondylitis.",

      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "Correct answer: A) Ankylosing Spondylitis Explanation: Ankylosing spondylitis (AS) primarily affects the spine and sacroiliac joints, leading to chronic inflammation. Patients often present with lower back pain and stiffness, particularly in the morning. The patient's age, HLA-B27 positivity and pattern of pain support AS as the diagnosis. Ankylosing Spondylitis Aetiology Pathology Genetic association: Strong familial link; more common in relatives of AS patients. HLA-B27: Over 95% of Caucasian AS patients are positive for this genetic marker, its prevalence correlates with AS incidence in different racial groups. Triggering factors: Antibody response to a bacterial antigen may cross-react with HLA-B27 positive cells. HLA-B27 may present specific antigens to T-cells, triggering an immune response. Infections (genitourinary, bowel) may contribute through lymphatic spread. AS is a seronegative spondyloarthropathy. Synovitis: Inflammation of diarthrodial joints (sacroiliac, vertebral), causing cartilage and bone destruction. It is associated with TNF alpha, IL-6, IL-17. Enthesopathy: Inflammation at fibro-osseous junctions, affecting ligaments, tendons, and intervertebral discs. Stages of progression: Inflammation with cellular infiltration. Fibrosis replacing granulation tissue. Ossification leads to ankylosis (joint fusion). Syndesmophytes: Bony bridges between vertebrae, leading to a \"bamboo spine\" in severe cases. Rheumatoid Arthritis (Option B) is an inflammatory joint disorder but differs from AS in that it predominantly affects peripheral joints (e.g., wrists, hands) rather than the spine and sacroiliac joints. Additionally, RA is associated with the presence of rheumatoid factor. Osteoarthritis (Option C) generally affects weight-bearing joints like the hips and knees, rather than the spine and sacroiliac joints. The absence of inflammatory markers and the association with HLA-B27 also point to AS in this case. Gout (Option D): Gout is caused by the deposition of urate crystals in joints, leading to acute episodes of severe joint pain, swelling, and redness. Gout typically affects the small joints, particularly in the lower extremities, like the big toe, rather than the spine or sacroiliac joints.

      "explanation": "Correct answer: B) Zigzag incision for skin separation Explanation: A zigzag incision , such as the Cronin zigzag technique, is commonly used in syndactyly surgery to prevent scar contractures. The zigzag pattern allows for better distribution of skin tension and reduces the likelihood of contractures forming as the child grows. Treatment of Syndactyly Operative Management: Surgical Timing: Performed around 12-18 months of age to reduce scar contractures. Early surgery (around 6 months) is advised for border digits (thumb, little finger) to prevent deformity. Surgical Technique: Zigzag incisions (e.g., the Cronin technique) are used to separate digits and minimise scar contracture. Avoid simultaneous separation of both sides of a digit to protect blood supply. Complex Syndactyly: May require bone separation (synostosis) with techniques like closing wedge osteotomies/ amputation Nonoperative Management : Mild or incomplete syndactyly and syndactyly of toes are often managed",
