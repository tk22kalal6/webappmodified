      "explanation": "Correct answer: B) Cubitus valgus Explanation: The scenario described, including the reported symptoms and the lateral deviation of the forearm when the arm is extended, points to a diagnosis of Cubitus Valgus . Description An acquired deformity due to reduced growth on the lateral side of the distal humeral epiphysis. Cause Non-union of lateral condylar fracture Clinical feature A carrying angle of the elbow greater than 15 degrees Asymmetry between the two side Lateral deviation of the forearm during arm extension Management Usually, no treatment is required Supracondylar osteotomy (in severe cases) Complication Tardy ulnar nerve palsy: Managed by anterior transposition of the ulnar nerve. Gunstock deformity (Option A) is also known as cubitus varus. It is caused by malunion of a supracondylar fracture in childhood. Dinner fork deformity (Option C) occurs due to a Colles' fracture. In this condition, the radial styloid process is positioned at or slightly above the level of the ulnar styloid process, creating the characteristic appearance of a dinner fork. Coxa vara (Option D) is a hip deformity characterised by a reduced angle between the neck and shaft of the femur. This condition can be congenital or acquired (Inter-trochanteric fracture).",

        "D": "Numbness of the forearm"
      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: B) Pain that intensifies with passive finger extension Explanation: The first sign of impending compartment syndrome is typically pain that worsens with passive stretching of the muscles in the affected compartment. (Stretch Test) Compartment Syndrome: It occurs when increased pressure within a limb's muscle compartments compromises blood flow to the muscles and nerves, potentially leading to severe complications. Causes: Common in children : Most frequently caused by supracondylar fractures. Adults : Often due to crush injuries; other causes include: Fractures of both bones of the forearm and elbow dislocations Vascular injuries and Subfascial hematomas. The flexor muscles, particularly the flexor digitorum profundus and flexor pollicis longus , are most commonly affected. Volkmann's ischemic contracture (VIC) may develop due to arterial spasm, leading to muscle ischemia and eventual fibrosis. The 6 Ps of Impending Volkmann’s Ischemia: Pain Pallor Paresthesia Paralysis Pulselessness Positive passive stretch test Diagnosis: Severe, poorly localised pain disproportionate to injury. Swelling, redness, warmth, tenderness, and tension in the forearm Stretch test : Pain occurs when ischemic muscles are stretched - the first sign of impending compartment syndrome . Other signs: Initially, palpable peripheral pulses may later become absent. Nerve involvement (Median nerve > Ulnar nerve) Treatment: Preventive measures, such as limb elevation and active finger movements, can help mitigate risks. Acute stage (Surgical Emergency): Removing any tight bandages & monitor intracompartmental pressure: Pressure > 30 mm Hg - Emergency fasciotomy Pressure < 30 mm Hg - Continuous monitoring Absence of the radial pulse on examination (Option A) indicates severe ischemia, which occurs when blood flow is critically compromised due to elevated compartment pressure & is not an early sign. Immediate improvement in pain with elevation of the arm (Option C) is not typical of compartment syndrome. Pain is not alleviated unless pressure is reduced in the compartment. Numbness in the forearm (Option D) can occur as a result of nerve compression due to increased compartment pressure, but it is a later sign.",

      "explanation": "Correct Answer: B) Junction of the middle and distal third Explanation: This fracture, known as a Holstein-Lewis fracture, typically occurs at the junction of the middle and distal third of the humeral shaft and is associated with radial nerve injury , leading to wrist drop and sensory loss over the dorsum of the hand. Mechanism of injury: Fall on outstretched hand or direct trauma to the arm. Management: Conservative: There is no role for conservative management in Holstein-lewis fracture The treatment of choice is emergency decompression For stable fractures, the initial management may include: U-slab or Hanging cast Chest arm bandage to immobilise the arm Surgical Intervention: In cases of displaced fractures or complicated cases: Open Reduction and Internal Fixation (ORIF) Intramedullary nailing Compression plating and screws External fixation Dynamic cock-up splint is used primarily to support the wrist and hand while allowing for some movement. It is designed to maintain the wrist in a neutral position (slightly extended) while permitting the fingers to flex and extend. Nerve damage is usually temporary, but in case of open fractures exploration might be needed. Supracondylar region (Option A): Fractures in the supracondylar region typically affect the median nerve , leading to symptoms such as weakness in wrist flexion and the \" hand of benediction\" sign. These fractures are more common in children and are less likely to cause wrist drop. Junction of the proximal and middle third (Option C) & Surgical neck of the humerus (Option D): Fractures at these locations primarily affect the axillary nerve.

The manoeuvre in the image is the Stimson technique , which reduces the dislocation by using a weight for traction and the body providing counter traction. Hippocrates technique (Option A) is an outdated method for shoulder dislocation reduction. The surgeon pulls firmly on the semi-abducted arm while placing a foot in the axilla, using it as a fulcrum to guide the humeral head back into place. Milch technique (Option C) involves manipulating the humeral head by applying traction to the arm, combined with external rotation and abduction, facilitating the repositioning of the humeral head into the glenoid cavity.

      "explanation": "Correct Answer: D) Recurrence Explanation: Recurrent shoulder dislocation is the most common complication following an initial dislocation. It occurs due to repeated trauma, capsular laxity, bone changes, muscle weakness, inadequate rehabilitation, or high-risk activities. Hill-Sachs and Bankart lesions , associated with shoulder dislocations, contribute to joint instability and increase the risk of recurrence. Complications of Shoulder Dislocation: Early Complications Delayed Complications Rotator cuff tear - Common in the elderly due to degenerative changes in the tendons and less common in younger patients. (Option B) Axillary artery injury - Rare; Occurs with severe trauma (Option B) Nerve injury - The axillary nerve is most commonly affected; other nerve injuries and complete brachial plexus palsy are rare. (Option A) Recurrence - Most common, due to instability. Joint stiffness - Results from prolonged immobility. Unreduced dislocation - Due to missed or undiagnosed dislocation.

      "explanation": "Correct Answer: D) c Explanation: Among the given options, the Capsule (marked as c) serves as a static stabilizer of the shoulder joint, while the Supraspinatus(a), the long head of the biceps(d), and Teres minor(b) act as dynamic stabilizers. Shoulder Joint: (Glenohumeral joint) It is formed by the articulation of the head of the humerus with the glenoid cavity of the scapula. While it is the most mobile joint in the body, its wide range of motion contributes to its instability, resulting in a high risk of dislocations. Static Stabilizers Dynamic Stabilizers Glenoid labrum : Enhances stability by deepening the glenoid cavity. Glenohumeral ligaments (Superior, Middle, and Inferior Ligaments) form the glenohumeral joint capsule (c) , connecting the glenoid fossa to the humerus.

      "explanation": "Correct Answer: B) Cuff and Collar Sling Explanation: The X-ray shows a right clavicular fracture in a one-year-old child with minimal displacement. In this case, symptomatic treatment with a cuff and collar sling is the most suitable option, providing adequate support and comfort during healing. Management of Clavicular Fracture: Clavicle fractures typically heal well; fragment reduction is not necessary, even if displaced. For minimal displacement, a triangular sling is adequate. Active shoulder exercises should begin once severe pain diminishes, usually around 10-14 days post-injury. Figure-of-‘8’ bandage (Option A) : This provides immobilisation and pain relief for young adults with displaced fractures and is not preferred for age <2 years. Conservative Methods: Cuff and Collar Sling : For undisplaced fractures to support the arm and shoulder.

Complications of Clavicle Fracture: Early Complications: Neurovascular Injury : This can occur immediately from trauma or later due to callus formation. Commonly affected structures include: Subclavian vessels (Statement 3) Medial cord of the brachial plexus (ulnar nerve) (Statement 1) These injuries are most associated with fractures of the middle third, the most common site of clavicle fractures. Late Complications: Malunion (Most Common) (Statement 2) results from difficulty maintaining alignment, typically causing cosmetic deformity but rarely impairing function, so treatment is often unnecessary. Shoulder Stiffness (Statement 4) : Common, especially in older patients and early mobilization can help prevent this. Non-Union : This occurs in 1–15% of cases, and risk factors include age and displacement. Symptomatic cases may require plate fixation and bone grafting.",

      },
      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: C) Medial 2/3rd & lateral 1/3rd junction Explanation: The given clinical scenario of a fall onto the shoulder with tenderness and swelling, as well as the X-ray findings, points towards a left clavicle fracture. Clavicular fracture most commonly occurs at the junction of the middle two-third and outer (lateral) thirds of the clavicle. This area is most vulnerable to injury due to the natural curvature of the bone and the forces exerted during trauma. It is the most common bone to be fractured in children. Displacement: The outer fragment tends to displace medially and downward due to gravity and the pull of the pectoralis major muscle. The inner fragment displaces upward because of the sternocleidomastoid muscle's pull. Allman’s Classification of Clavicular Fracture: Group I : Fractures involving the middle third of the shaft. Group II : Fractures involving the lateral third, distal to the coracoclavicular ligament, further subdivided into: (Proposed by Neer) Type A : Coracoclavicular ligament intact. Type B : Coracoclavicular ligament ruptured. Type C : Intra-articular extension into the acromioclavicular joint Group III : Fractures of the medial third. Radiographs: The following views are recommended for evaluating clavicle fractures: Routine Anteroposterior (AP) View of the clavicle. IIIIII Lordotic View if the fracture is uncertain. Special Radiographic Techniques like CT Scans are required for assessing the distal clavicle. Findings: Fracture Line : A clear line usually located in the middle third of the",
