      "question": "A motorcyclist met with a road traffic accident and had a metacarpal fracture. Hypothenar atrophy is observed. Identify the nerve involved.",
      "options": {
        "A": "Radial nerve",
        "B": "Ulnar nerve",
        "C": "Musculocutaneous nerve",
        "D": "Median nerve"
      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "damage to the ulnar nerve in case of a metacarpal fracture can lead to hypothenar atrophy. Ulnar nerve supply in the hand: The ulnar nerve travels alongside the ulnar artery and gives off a palmar cutaneous branch before reaching the flexor retinaculum, supplying the ulnar side of the palm & enters Guyon’s canal & divides into: Superficial Branch: Supplies the skin of the medial 1½ fingers & Palmaris brevis. Deep Branch: Supplies all intrinsic muscles of the hand except muscles of thenar eminence & 1st two lumbricals and terminates supplying Adductor pollicis, aka Graveyard of Ulnar nerve. Guyon’s Canal (Ulnar Tunnel Syndrome): Compression of the ulnar nerve within Guyon’s canal at the wrist. Clinical Features: Claw-Hand Deformity: The ring and little fingers exhibit pronounced ulnar claw hand when compared to injury of the ulnar nerve at the elbow (ulnar paradox) due to preserved function of the FDP, resulting in marked flexion of DIP joints. Atrophy of the Hypothenar Eminence (Option B) Loss of Finger Abduction and Adduction Positive Froment’s Sign: Unable to hold the book between thumb and index indicates weakness in the adductor pollicis. DIP Of thumb compensates for adductor pollicis weakness and thumb flexion occurs. Radial nerve (Options A) Damage to the radial nerve leads to wrist drop (inability to extend the wrist) and loss of elbow extension. Musculocutaneous nerve (Options C) injury causes weakness in elbow flexion, forearm supination and shoulder flexion. Sensory loss on the lateral aspect of the forearm is also seen Median nerve (Options D) lesion causes difficulty flexing the index and middle fingers and loss of thumb opposition, but it does not affect hypothenar eminence.",

      "question": "A 60-year-old patient presents with limping gait and left hip pain. What is the likely diagnosis?",
      "options": {
        "A": "Tuberculosis of the hip",
        "B": "Rheumatoid arthritis",
        "C": "Ankylosing spondylitis",
        "D": "Avascular necrosis"
      },
      "correct_answer": "D",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: D) Avascular necrosis Explanation: This patient likely has avascular necrosis (AVN) , a condition where bone cells die due to a lack of blood supply. It often affects weight-bearing joints like the hip, knee, talus, and humeral head, with the hip being most common. The X-ray shows flattening of the top and side of the femoral head, a typical sign. However, MRI is the best for diagnosing and staging AVN. Initial investigation for avascular necrosis (AVN) is typically an X-ray, but it may not show signs until at least 3 months after onset. X-ray findings include increased bone density and a crescent sign, indicating a tangential fracture line below the joint surface. Radio scintigraphy with mTc-sulphur colloid or CT scan can be used. MRI is the preferred choice due to its ability to detect early marrow changes and bone ischemia. Intramedullary pressure measurement and biopsy are other options for diagnosis. Biopsy, though invasive, offers early detection and intervention possibilities with medical treatment. Tuberculosis of the hip (Option A): Irregular and hazy joint margins, destruction of bone on either side of the joint, erosions, and reduced joint space are classical plain X-ray findings. Rheumatoid arthritis (Option B): It primarily affects small joints of the hands. Hallmark radiographic findings include marginal erosions, soft tissue swelling, osteoporosis, and joint space narrowing. Ankylosing spondylitis (Option C): Spine and sacroiliac joints are involved. Plain X-ray of the spine shows erosions at the corners of vertebral bodies with reactive sclerosis, vertebral body squaring, and a characteristic bamboo spine appearance.",

      "explanation": "indicating severe and advanced muscle and nerve damage. It is crucial to recognize and treat compartment syndrome promptly to prevent irreversible tissue damage and complications. Compartment syndrome: Compartment syndrome is a condition where increased pressure within a closed muscle compartment compromises the circulation and function of the tissues within that space. The classic symptoms and signs include the \"5 Ps\": pain, pallor, paresthesia (tingling or numbness), paralysis, and pulselessness. Clinical Features: Initial Symptoms of Compartment Syndrome (in chronological order) Pain (Option D) : The earliest symptom , worsened by passive extension of fingers - Stretch pain Pallor (Option A) : Skin may appear pale due to reduced blood supply. Pulselessness (Option C) : Diminished or absent radial pulse. Paresthesia : Numbness or tingling due to nerve compression. Paralysis : Weakness or inability to move fingers, indicating nerve ischemia. Causes include: Tight bandages and dressings Animal bites Burns Intensive and excessive exercises Muscle hypertrophy Neoplasms Bleeding into a closed compartment (injury to a vessel, congenital or acquired disorder) Injections in the forearm Surgery on the forearm Common sites: Most common: Flexor compartment of the forearm. 2nd Most common: Anterior and deep posterior compartments of the legs. Rare sites: Buttocks, shoulder, hand, foot, arm, and lumbar paraspinal muscles.

        "D": "Patient with a fractured arm with capillary refill time of 5 seconds in his fingers"
      },
      "correct_answer": "D",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: D) Patient with a fractured arm with capillary refill time of 5 seconds in his fingers because a capillary refill time of 5 seconds indicates potential circulatory compromise, which is a medical emergency. Such a delay in capillary refill suggests that the blood flow to the fingers is inadequate, possibly due to vascular injury or severe swelling, necessitating immediate orthopaedic evaluation and intervention to prevent further complications, such as limb ischemia Orthopedic Emergencies: Open fractures and dislocations Hip dislocations (risk of AVN) Neural compromise, especially with spinal injury Symptoms or signs of neurovascular injury (numbness, paresis, poor perfusion) Acute septic arthritis and osteomyelitis Compartment syndrome (eg, pain out of proportion to injuries, pallor, paresthesias, coolness, pulselessness) Vascular injuries (e.g., knee dislocation) Exsanguinating pelvic fractures Incorrect Options: The patient with recurrent shoulder dislocation (Option A) may require follow-up but does not represent an acute emergency. The patient with a fractured arm and capillary refill time of less than 3 seconds (Option B) indicates adequate perfusion and does not require immediate intervention. The patient with a fractured arm and a 10 cm long incision (Option C) may need attention but does not exhibit signs of circulatory compromise as severe as the fourth option.

      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: A) Hemiarthroplasty Explanation: Hemiarthroplasty is the preferred treatment for displaced femoral neck fractures in elderly patients, particularly those who are inactive or have multiple comorbidities. It involves replacing the femoral head while leaving the acetabulum intact. In a femoral neck fracture, especially in elderly patients, the classic presentation of the limb includes external rotation and shortening. The external rotation occurs due to the pull of the external rotator muscles, such as the gluteus maximus and the short external rotators, on the distal femoral fragment. Shortening of the limb occurs due to muscle contraction and overriding of the bone fragments, particularly in displaced fractures. Fracture of the Neck of Femur The fracture of the neck of the femur is a significant injury, particularly in the elderly, and is often associated with osteoporosis and trauma. Etiology Low-Energy Trauma Common in elderly with osteoporosis ; simple fall from standing height can cause a fracture. Osteoporosis Age-related bone loss; post-menopausal",

      "question": "For hypertrophic non-union following a fracture, the most appropriate treatment",
      "options": {
        "A": "Stabilization",
        "B": "Bone grafting",
        "C": "Stabilization and bone grafting",
        "D": "None of the above"
      },
      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "where there is excessive callus formation at the fracture site, but the bone ends fail to unite. In this case, the most appropriate treatment is stabilization, which involves providing mechanical support and immobilization to the fractured bone. Stabilization can be achieved using various methods such as external fixation, internal fixation with plates and screws, or intramedullary nails. Stabilization promotes bone healing by reducing motion at the fracture site, allowing for the formation of a more stable environment that encourages bone union. Incorrect Options: Option B: Bone grafting- While bone grafting can be a useful treatment option for certain types of non-union, it is not the first-line treatment for hypertrophic non-union. Hypertrophic non-union typically involves adequate callus formation, indicating that there is potential for bone healing. Therefore, stabilization alone is often sufficient to promote bone union in hypertrophic non-union cases, without the need for additional bone grafting. Option C: Stabilization and bone grafting- In hypertrophic non-union, where there is excessive callus formation, stabilization alone is usually effective in promoting bone healing. The addition of bone grafting may not be necessary in this situation, as the existing callus provides a favorable environment for bone union. Therefore, stabilization and bone grafting are not typically combined as the primary treatment for hypertrophic non-union. Option D: None of the above- The correct answer is not \"None of the above\" because stabilization is indeed an appropriate treatment option for hypertrophic non-union. While bone grafting may be indicated in certain types of non-union, it is not the most appropriate treatment for hypertrophic non-union. Reference: .",

It most commonly affects the limbs, especially the lower leg. Incorrect Options: Option B . Pallor: Pallor, or paleness of the skin, can occur in advanced stages of compartment syndrome when the blood flow to the affected muscles and tissues is severely compromised. However, pallor is not an early symptom and may not be present in the initial stages. Option C . Paresthesia: Paresthesia refers to abnormal sensations, such as tingling or numbness. It can occur as the condition progresses and nerve function becomes compromised. Similar to pallor, paresthesia is not an early symptom and may develop in later stages. Option D. Paralysis: Paralysis, or loss of muscle function, is a late sign of compartment syndrome and is typically indicative of severe tissue damage and nerve involvement. It is not an early symptom.",

      "explanation": "fragment of dead or necrotic bone that has become separated from the surrounding healthy bone. It typically occurs as a result of chronic osteomyelitis, which is a bone infection. The sequestrum is a non-viable piece of bone that lacks a blood supply and is often surrounded by a layer of inflammatory tissue called the involucrum. Treatment for a sequestrum usually involves surgical removal to promote healing and prevent the spread of infection. Involucrum: Involucrum is a term used to describe a layer of new bone that forms around a sequestrum or a chronic bone infection. It is part of the body's defense mechanism to isolate and contain the infection. The involucrum serves as a protective barrier, surrounding the sequestrum and helping to limit the spread of infection to healthy bone. It is composed of new bone formation and is often seen in cases of chronic osteomyelitis. Surgical intervention may be required to address the underlying infection and promote healing.
