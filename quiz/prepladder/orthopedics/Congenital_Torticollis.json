      "question": "A 3-year-old child is brought to the emergency department after a sudden pull on their arm. The child is holding their right arm close to their body and refuses to move it.

      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: B) Flexed and pronated Explanation: The condition indicates a pulled elbow (nursemaid’s elbow) caused by a sudden pull on the arm, leading to radial head subluxation. The classic arm position is slightly flexed and pronated. Pulled Elbow (also known as Nursemaid’s Elbow) Age group 1-5 years (most common) Mechanism of injury A sudden jerk or pull on the arm when it is extended and pronated causes the radial head to slip out of the annular ligament (radial head subluxation). Clinical presentation The child holds the affected arm close to the body in a slightly flexed and pronated position, resisting movement, particularly supination. X-ray Diagnosis is usually clinical. X-ray is unnecessary unless there is suspicion of other injuries. It may appear normal If visible, they can show subtle displacement of the radial head , with the possible elevation of the anterior fat pad or visibility of the posterior fat pad, indicating joint effusion. Treatment Reduction of the subluxation by supination and flexion or hyperpronation of the forearm typically results in immediate relief.",

A Handshake cast is typically used for a Colles fracture, not Smith’s fracture. Smith fracture or Reverse Colles fracture Site Involves the distal end of the radius with volar displacement of the distal fragment (opposite to a Colles fracture). (Option D) Mechanism It occurs due to a fall on an outstretched hand with a flexed wrist , leading to ventral displacement and tilting of the distal fragment. (Option A) X-ray Shows a tilted or displaced distal fragment at the radius. Management Closed reduction followed by above-elbow plaster of Paris (POP) immobilisation in extension for six weeks.

      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: C) Marfan syndrome Explanation: While Marfan syndrome can lead to musculoskeletal issues due to its effects on connective tissue, it is not commonly associated with congenital torticollis. Congenital Torticollis (CT) is caused by fibromatosis within the sternocleidomastoid muscle and often resolves within a year. It may lead to permanent muscle fibrotic changes and torticollis if not treated. Clinical Associations: It is frequently associated with difficult deliveries and other musculoskeletal disorders, including: Metatarsus adductus Developmental dysplasia of the hip Congenital Talipes equinovarus (CTEV) Congenital dislocation of the hip (7-20%) Syndromes Associated with Congenital Torticollis: Grisel Syndrome (Option B) refers to atlantoaxial rotatory fixation, where the atlas (C1) is displaced on the axis (C2), resulting in a fixed head position similar to the head tilt seen in torticollis. It often occurs after nasopharyngeal infections, tonsillectomy, or retropharyngeal abscesses. Down’s Syndrome (Option D): Children with Down syndrome often have atlantoaxial instability, which can lead to torticollis due to laxity in the transverse ligament and associated bony anomalies. Morquio Syndrome (Option A) is a skeletal dysplasia that can lead to cervical spine abnormalities, including basilar invagination and odontoid anomalies. These conditions may cause mechanical instability or neurological impairment, resulting in torticollis. Klippel Feil Syndrome involves the congenital fusion of at least two cervical vertebrae, most commonly in the upper cervical spine. This fusion restricts neck mobility and can lead to compensatory movements, resulting in torticollis. Also associated with sprengel deformity.",

        "D": "Use of a cervical collar to restrict head movement"
      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: B) Regular stretching exercises and physical therapy Explanation: For infants < 1 year , conservative management is recommended. Regular stretching and physical therapy can help improve muscle length and function, facilitating recovery. Management of Congenital Torticollis: Spontaneous resolution : Most children improve without intervention. Conservative Management: (For Infants < 1 Year) Manual stretching by tilting the head towards the opposite shoulder. Early intervention (before 3-4 months) leads to excellent outcomes (92% to 100% achieving full rotation). Simply observing without intervention is not advisable (Option C). Surgical Intervention: If Congenital Torticollis persists beyond one year or after six months of physical therapy, surgical correction may be necessary (Option A) . Surgical techniques: Unipolar release: An incision is made near the clavicle, releasing the muscle at its inferior ends. Bipolar release (Ferkel’s Operation): The sternocleidomastoid muscle is released at both ends to provide more comprehensive correction. Complications of Surgery: Injury to Spinal accessory nerve & carotid bulb. Use of a cervical collar to restrict head movement (Option D) is not advisable in this case as it may lead to further complications and does not address the underlying muscle tightness.
