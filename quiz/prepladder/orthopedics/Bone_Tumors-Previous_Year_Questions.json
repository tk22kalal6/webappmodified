      "explanation": "Correct Answer: A) Osteosarcoma Explanation: Osteosarcoma is the most common type of cancer occurring in long bones and it's common amongst children in 2nd decade. It is a metaphyseal tumor, usually located at Distal end of femur. It has a bimodal presentation and is the most radioresistant tumor Characteristics : Codman triangle as seen in image (from elevation of periosteum) or sunburst pattern on x-ray (think of an osteocod [bone fish] swimming in the sun). Treatment ; Neoadjuvent chemotherapy followed by surgery/ limb ablation. Ewing Sarcoma (Option B): Although Ewing sarcoma is also a bone-mediated tumor, it commonly affects pelvis, ribs, spine and long bones as opposed to Osteosarcoma which only affects the long bones of the arms and legs and the x-ray image is of the femur. Osteiod Osteoma (Option C): In case of Osteiod Osteoma the x-ray imaging shows presence of nidus surrounded by sclerosis, which is not indicating the x-ray image. GCT (Option D): Giant Cell Tumors are typically found at the ends of the long bones and extend into the epiphysis to surface of the joint, whereas the images show a tumor which is not located at the end of the bone.",

      "question": "A 35 year old man presented with a gradual progressive swelling, and was diagnosed with Adamantinoma. Which of the following bones is typically affected by this tumor?",
      "options": {
        "A": "Radius",
        "B": "Humerus",
        "C": "Femur",
        "D": "Tibia"
      },
      "correct_answer": "D",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: D) Tibia Explanation: The tibia is the most common site for adamantinoma, particularly the anterior metaphysis or diaphysis. This predilection is due to the close proximity of the tibia's enchondral bone to the skin, which supports the embryological displacement theory. Adamantinoma About Rare, low-grade malignant bone tumors of uncertain histogenesis Commonly affects the anterior metaphysis and diaphysis tibia, close to the skin surface. Immunohistochemical studies suggest epithelial origin. Commonly affects individuals aged 20-40 years. Histopathology Macroscopic: Well-defined, lobulated cortical tumors with yellowish-gray appearance and possible cystic spaces. Microscopic: Biphasic composition (epithelial and osteofibrous components) with basaloid, tubular, spindle-cell, squamous, and osteofibrous dysplasia-like patterns. Immunohistochemistry: Epithelial cells: Positive for keratin, EMA, vimentin, p63, podoplanin. Fibrous component: Positive for vimentin. Expression of EGF, EGFR (epithelial), FGF2, FGFR1 (both components). Clinical Features Prolonged clinical course with slow-growing swelling, possible pain, bone deformities, or pathological fractures (~23%). Rarely involves neurological deficits when the spine is affected. Metastases commonly involve lungs, lymph nodes, or spine. Evaluation X-ray: Well-circumscribed, multilobulated, osteolytic cortical tumor with a \"soap-bubble\" appearance. CT Scan: Assesses soft tissue extension and cortical involvement. MRI: Locoregional staging; visualizes tumor margins, cortical involvement, and soft tissue extension. Treatment Wide Resection: En bloc removal with wide margins preferred. Metastasectomy: First-line for pulmonary recurrences. Radius (Option A): Although adamantinoma can rarely occur in the radius, it is an atypical site. The tibia remains the most frequently affected bone. Humerus (Option B): Adamantinoma seldom affects the humerus. It primarily involves long bones of the lower limb, with the tibia being the most common. Femur (Option C) can be involved in rare cases, but it is far less commonly affected than the tibia.

      "explanation": "Correct Answer: B) Aneurysmal bone cyst Explanation: An aneurysmal bone cyst (ABC) is often characterized by an expansile, lytic lesion, and its FNA typically yields a bloody aspirate due to the cystic, vascular nature of the lesion . Hemosiderin-laden macrophages are commonly seen due to prior hemorrhage within the cyst. Giant cell tumor (GCT) (Option A) can also present as an expansile lytic lesion, but it usually involves the epiphysis without such a significant cystic, vascular component or bloody aspirate on FNA.

Age group: Bimodal age distribution peaking in adolescence (10–14 years) and again in the seventh decade. Gender: Males >> Female All osteosarcomas are aggressive and metastasize widely through the hematogenous route, typically to the lungs. Despite its aggressiveness, it seldom penetrates the epiphyseal plate. Histopathology: Anaplastic mesenchymal parenchyma with tumor cells surrounded by osteoid. Clinical manifestation: Worsening pain and swelling, particularly night pain. Pathological fracture is rare. On examination: Shiny skin with prominent veins over swelling. Poorly defined, warm, and tender swelling. Adjacent joint movement may be limited due to swelling. The tumor may compress neurovascular structures, causing symptoms. Usually reactive enlargement of regional lymph nodes. Associated syndromes with osteosarcoma development: Li–Fraumeni (p53 tumor suppressor gene mutation) Hereditary retinoblastoma syndromes Rothmund–Thomson syndrome X-ray findings of osteosarcoma: Area of irregular destruction in the metaphysis. The cortex overlying the lesion is eroded. Sun-ray appearance (aggressive periostitis): As the tumor grows into the overlying soft tissues new bone is laid down centrifugally along the blood vessels within the tumor. Codman's triangle: Elevation of periosteum by the growing tumor in the form of a triangle. CT scan is primarily used to assist with biopsy and disease staging. Treatment Combination of therapy: Surgical amputation is the treatment of choice- complete removal of the tumor must be ensured. Limb-salvage procedures have become possible and popular. Radiotherapy Chemotherapy Doxorubicin Cisplatin Ifosfamide Methotrexate Follow-up: Every 6-8 weeks.

Therefore, ordering the CD1a marker test would be the appropriate next step to confirm the diagnosis. Incorrect Options: Option A - MRI (Magnetic Resonance Imaging): While an MRI scan can provide detailed images of the hip joint and surrounding structures, it is not specific for diagnosing Langerhans cell histiocytosis. It may be useful in evaluating the extent of involvement or complications related to LCH, but it would not provide a definitive diagnosis. Option B - Serum Calcium: Serum calcium levels may be elevated in some cases of Langerhans cell histiocytosis, but it is not a specific diagnostic test for this condition. Serum calcium alone cannot confirm or exclude the diagnosis of LCH. Option C - Serum PTH (Parathyroid Hormone): Serum PTH levels are not directly related to the diagnosis of Langerhans cell histiocytosis.

Adamantinoma is most commonly seen in the diaphysis (shaft) of the tibia, but it can also occur in other long bones. Clinical Presentation: Adamantinoma most commonly presents in young to middle-aged adults, typically between the ages of 20 and 40. The most common site of involvement is the tibia, particularly the diaphysis (shaft) region. Patients often present with localized pain, swelling, and a palpable mass in the affected bone. Rarely, pathological fractures can occur. Histopathology: Adamantinoma is characterized by the presence of biphasic cellular components: epithelial-like cells and fibrous or osteofibrous stroma. The epithelial-like cells form glandular or tubular structures resembling the enamel organ of developing teeth. The stroma is composed of fibrous tissue with varying degrees of osteoid or bone formation. Microscopic examination and immunohistochemistry are used to confirm the diagnosis. Radiological Findings: On X-ray, Adamantinoma typically presents as a lytic lesion within the affected bone, often with associated cortical thinning or expansion. The lesion may exhibit a \"soap-bubble\" appearance due to areas of bone destruction and reactive bone formation. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) can provide detailed information about the extent of the tumor and its relationship to surrounding structures. Treatment: Surgical resection is the mainstay of treatment for Adamantinoma. Incorrect Options: Option A - Radius: Adamantinoma primarily affects the tibia, not the radius. Option B - Humerus: Adamantinoma primarily affects the tibia, not the humerus. Option C - Femur: Adamantinoma primarily affects the tibia, not the femur. Reference: Prepladder Notes",
