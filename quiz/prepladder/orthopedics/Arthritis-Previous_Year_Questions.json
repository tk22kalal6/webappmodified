Physical Examination- Joint examination revealing signs of inflammation (redness, swelling, warmth) Synovial Fluid Analysis -Detection of monosodium urate crystals in synovial fluid aspirated from an affected joint Serum Uric Acid Level - Elevated serum uric acid levels (>6.8 mg/dL) may support the diagnosis, but levels can be normal during an acute attack. Treatment: Acute Attack - Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), colchicine, corticosteroids for pain relief and inflammation control Long-term Management - Lifestyle modifications (dietary changes, weight loss), medications to lower uric acid levels (allopurinol, febuxostat) to prevent further attacks. Serum Uric Acid Level (Option A): While elevated serum uric acid levels are often seen in individuals with gout, they are not sufficient to confirm the diagnosis on their own. Urine Uric Acid Levels (Option C): Urine uric acid levels are not typically used as a diagnostic test for gout. Although increased urinary excretion of uric acid may be observed in some cases of gout, it is not a specific or reliable marker for diagnosing the condition. X-Ray Changes (Option D): X-ray changes, such as the presence of joint erosions or bone damage, may occur in advanced stages of gout or if there have been recurrent episodes of inflammation over time.

      "explanation": "Correct Answer: B) Ankylosing spondylitis Explanation: Young male with lower backache and morning stiffness are suggestive of Ankylosing spondylitis. Ankylosing Spondylitis (AS) / Marie Strumpell Disease Definition Chronic inflammatory disease primarily affecting the axial skeleton (spine and sacroiliac joints), leading to pain, stiffness, and spinal fusion (bamboo spine) . Etiology Idiopathic; genetic (HLA-B27) and environmental factors involved. HLA-B27 is positive in 90% of cases, but not all carriers develop AS. Pathophysiology Inflammation at entheses → Erosive changes → New bone formation → Syndesmophytes → Spinal fusion (ankylosis). Clinical Features Musculoskeletal Symptoms: Chronic low back pain (worse after inactivity, better with activity) Limited spinal mobility Enthesitis (Achilles, plantar fascia) Peripheral arthritis (hips, shoulders, knees) Extra-articular Symptoms: Ocular: Anterior uveitis (pain, redness, photophobia) Cardiovascular: Aortic regurgitation, conduction issues Pulmonary: Apical fibrosis Gastrointestinal: Associated with IBD Clinical tests: Schober/ Modified Schober test (for lumbar spine) Gaenslen’s test Patrick/FABER test Figure of 4 test Pump handle test Diagnosis Based on clinical features, imaging studies, and HLA-B27 gene presence. Modified New York Criteria: Clinical Criteria: Low back pain > 3 months (improves with exercise, not with rest) Limited lumbar spine motion (sagittal/frontal planes) Reduced chest expansion (relative to age/sex) Radiographic Criteria (X-ray): Bilateral sacroiliitis (grade 2-4) or unilateral sacroiliitis (grade 3-4) Radiological Features: Blurring/haziness of sacroiliac joint Squaring of vertebrae Bamboo spine Dagger sign MRI: Early detection of inflammation Laboratory Tests HLA-B27 positive (90% of cases) ESR, CRP: Elevated during active disease, but can be normal Treatment Non-Pharmacological: Physical therapy (mobility/posture exercises) Patient education on disease and exercise importance Pharmacological: NSAIDs (first-line for pain, stiffness) TNF inhibitors/IL-17 inhibitors (Secukinumab) Sulfasalazine (for peripheral arthritis) Corticosteroids (short-term flare control) Surgical: Hip replacement (for severe hip involvement) Spinal surgery (for severe deformities/fractures) Complications Spinal fractures (minimal trauma) Cardiac issues (aortic regurgitation, conduction defects) Osteoporosis leading to fracture risk Incorrect Options: Tuberculosis of the spine (Option A): Tuberculosis of the spine also known as Pott's disease, is a potential differential diagnosis, particularly in regions where tuberculosis is endemic. However, in this case, the patient's age, chronicity of symptoms, and the absence of constitutional symptoms such as weight loss and night sweats make ankylosing spondylitis more likely. Disc prolapse (Option C): Disc prolapse can cause lower back pain and radicular symptoms radiating down the leg due to nerve root compression. However, the presence of morning stiffness and bilateral heel pain in this patient suggests an inflammatory condition such as ankylosing spondylitis rather than a disc prolapse. Mechanical Pain (Option D): Mechanical pain resulting from musculoskeletal strain or injury, can certainly cause lower back pain. However, the chronicity of symptoms, morning stiffness, and the involvement of sacroiliac joints and heels make ankylosing",

Gout is characterized by the deposition of monosodium urate crystals in the joints, leading to inflammation and symptoms. Synovial fluid analysis involves aspirating fluid from an affected joint and examining it under a microscope . The presence of needle-shaped urate crystals in the synovial fluid confirms the diagnosis of gout. Incorrect Options: Option A - Serum Uric Acid Level: While elevated serum uric acid levels are often seen in individuals with gout, they are not sufficient to confirm the diagnosis on their own. Many people with elevated serum uric acid levels do not develop gout, and some individuals with gout may have normal or only slightly elevated levels of uric acid. Therefore, serum uric acid levels alone are not definitive for diagnosing gout. Option C - Urine Uric Acid Levels: Urine uric acid levels are not typically used as a diagnostic test for gout.

      "explanation": "True - Incision and drainage should be performed after obtaining a culture of the joint aspirate and initiating antibiotic therapy for at least 24 hours. This statement is correct as it is essential to identify the causative organism and initiate appropriate antibiotic treatment before performing surgical drainage. Incorrect Options: Option A - Staph aureus is most common organism in adults: False - Staph aureus is the most common organism in young children. This statement is incorrect as Staphylococcus aureus is a common causative organism in septic arthritis, especially in children. Option C - Kocher’s criteria is used to differentiate from transient synovitis: False - Kocher's criteria are not used to differentiate septic arthritis from transient synovitis. This statement is incorrect. Kocher's criteria are used to assess the likelihood of septic arthritis in children with an acutely painful hip, based on factors such as fever, inability to bear weight, elevated white blood cell count, and elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate. It helps in determining the need for further diagnostic evaluation and treatment. Option D - Widening of joint space is seen: False - Widening of the joint space is not typically seen in septic arthritis. This statement is incorrect. In septic arthritis, joint space narrowing is more commonly observed due to the accumulation of inflammatory fluid and destruction of articular structures. Reference: Prepladder Notes",

      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Infliximab helps stop further structural deformity . The treatment of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) involves both acute management of active disease and long-term management to control symptoms and prevent joint damage. Treatment of RA: Acute Stage Treatment: Corticosteroids: In the acute stage of RA with positive classical signs, corticosteroids may be prescribed temporarily for 1 to 2 weeks to reduce inflammation and pain. Lab Investigations: Anti-CCP (Anti-Cyclic Citrullinated Peptide): This test is considered the best investigation for RA, as it can be positive in the early stages and has prognostic importance. Rheumatoid Factor (RF): RF is positive in about 60% of RA cases but may also be positive in other conditions such as cryoglobulinemia, Parvo 19 infection, and hepatitis C. Disease-Modifying Antirheumatic Drugs (DMARDs): Hydroxychloroquine (HCQ): Used to treat mild RA, but may cause ocular side effects such as bull's eye-like maculopathy or hemeralopia. Sulfasalazine: Another DMARD option for RA treatment. Methotrexate: Considered the best DMARD for RA, typically administered at a dose of 7.5mg once a week. Regular monitoring of white blood cell (WBC) count is necessary to check for bone marrow suppression. Leflunomide: An alternative DMARD option for RA treatment, although less commonly used. Incorrect Options: Option A - Steroids: Steroids may be used as part of the treatment plan in RA to provide short-term relief of symptoms and manage acute flares. However, long-term use of steroids is generally not recommended due to their side effects, and they are not the primary treatment option for managing deformities in RA. Option B - Methotrexate with steroids: Using MTX with steroids, which can be a combination used in certain cases, especially for short-term symptom control or during a disease flare. However, the long-term management of deformities in RA usually involves the use of DMARDs rather than relying solely on steroids. Option D - Steroids only after NSAlDs fail: Using steroids only after NSAIDs (nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs) fail. While NSAIDs can help manage pain and inflammation in RA, they are not sufficient for controlling the disease or managing deformities. DMARDs, including MTX and biologic agents, are the mainstay of treatment for RA and are typically initiated early in the disease course. Reference: Prepladder Notes",

      "explanation": "Costovertebral and costosternal ankylosis may cause restrictive lung disease. The Costovertebral and costosternal ankylosis may cause restrictive lung disease. Trouble breathing as the upper body curves forward and the chest wall stiffens. Severe ankylosing spondylitis can also cause scarring of the lungs (pulmonary fibrosis) and an increased risk of lung infection . Incorrect Options: Option A - HLA B37: This is incorrect as HLA B 27 is a genetic marker that is strongly associated with an increased risk of developing ankylosing spondylitis. Option C - More common in Females: This option is incorrect as It is more common in More common in males. Option D - Vertebral Expansion: This option is incorrect as there is vertebral fusion.

      "question": "What is the most common form of arthritis?",
      "options": {
        "A": "Rheumatoid arthritis",
        "B": "Psoriatic arthritis",
        "C": "Seronegative arthritis",
        "D": "Osteoarthritis"
      },
      "correct_answer": "D",
      "explanation": "degenerative joint disease characterized by the breakdown and gradual loss of cartilage in the joints. Osteoarthritis primarily affects weight-bearing joints such as the knees, hips, and spine, as well as the hands and other joints. It is associated with joint pain, stiffness, swelling, and reduced range of motion. Osteoarthritis is typically age-related and can be influenced by factors such as joint overuse, joint trauma, obesity, and genetics. Incorrect Options: Option A - Rheumatoid Arthritis: Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is an autoimmune disease in which the immune system mistakenly attacks the synovium (the lining of the joints). It causes chronic inflammation, leading to joint pain, swelling, stiffness, and potentially joint deformities. Rheumatoid arthritis is characterized by the symmetrical involvement of multiple joints, typically affecting the small joints of the hands and feet. It is more common in women than men and can also affect other organs in the body. While rheumatoid arthritis is a significant form of arthritis, it is not as prevalent as osteoarthritis. Option B - Psoriatic Arthritis: Psoriatic arthritis is a type of inflammatory arthritis that occurs in some individuals with psoriasis, a chronic skin condition characterized by red, scaly patches on the skin. Psoriatic arthritis can cause joint pain, swelling, stiffness, and tenderness. It typically affects the joints of the fingers and toes but can also involve larger joints such as the knees, hips, and spine. Psoriatic arthritis is less common than osteoarthritis, but its association with psoriasis makes it an important consideration in patients with both skin and joint symptoms. Option C - Seronegative Arthritis: Seronegative arthritis is a term used to describe a group of inflammatory arthritis conditions that do not show certain specific antibodies, such as rheumatoid factor or anti-cyclic citrullinated peptide (anti-CCP) antibodies, in the blood. Some examples of seronegative arthritis conditions include ankylosing spondylitis, reactive arthritis, psoriatic arthritis, and enteropathic arthritis. These conditions share common features of inflammatory joint involvement, but they may also have extra-articular manifestations. While seronegative arthritis conditions can cause significant joint inflammation, they are less prevalent than osteoarthritis. Reference: Prepladder Notes",
