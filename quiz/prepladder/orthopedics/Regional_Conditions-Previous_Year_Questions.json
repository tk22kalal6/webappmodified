Painful Arc Syndrome: Description Pain in the shoulder and upper arm during the mid-range (60-120 degrees) of gleno-humeral abduction. (Option B) Causes Minor tears of the supraspinatus tendon Supraspinatus tendinitis Calcification of supraspinatus tendon Subacromial bursitis Fracture of the greater tuberosity Pathogenesis The space between the upper end of the humerus and the acromion gets compromised, leading to the rotator cuff tendon being pinched between the greater tuberosity and the acromion during mid-abduction. Clinical Features Pain during mid-range of gleno-humeral abduction Tenderness at the supraspinatus tendon or subacromial space Restriction of shoulder movements Treatment Ultrasound therapy to the tender point Anti-inflammatory drugs Injection of hydrocortisone into the subacromial space Excision of the anterior part of the acromion Reference: Maheshwari Essential Orthopaedics 5th edition pages- 305,306.",
