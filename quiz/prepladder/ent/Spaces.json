      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: D) Second pharyngeal arch nerve Explanation: Eagle syndrome involves the elongation or calcification of the stylohyoid ligament or styloid process, which can cause symptoms such as throat pain, referred ear pain (otalgia), and difficulty swallowing (dysphagia). Surgical intervention may be needed, and care should be taken to avoid damaging nearby structures. The facial nerve (cranial nerve VII) , derived from the second pharyngeal arch, is most likely to be affected during surgery due to its proximity to the stylohyoid ligament. Derivatives of the Pharyngeal arches: Pharyngeal arch Muscles derived Bones derived Cranial nerve Derivatives of clefts and pouches Mandibular arch (Arch I) Muscles of mastication, tensor veli palatini, tensor tympani, mylohyoid, anterior belly of digastric. Malleus Incus Trigeminal nerve (Option A) External auditory canal. The pouch of the first and second arches merges to further develop into the eustachian tube and the middle ear cavity. Hyoid Arch (Arch II) Muscles of facial expressions, stapedius, stylohyoid, posterior belly of the digastric muscle. Stapes Lesser horn of hyoid bone Upper part of the body, hyoid bone Styloid.

        "D": "Eustachian tube"
      },
      "correct_answer": "D",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: D) Eustachian tube Explanation: The patient's symptoms align with Trotter's syndrome , commonly associated with nasopharyngeal carcinoma. This condition involves: Conductive hearing loss due to obstruction of the Eustachian tube, which is responsible for equalising ear pressure. Trigeminal neuralgia affects the mandibular division of the trigeminal nerve, 5thleading to facial pain. Palatal asymmetry resulting from tumour infiltration into the levator palatini muscles. Mnemonic: N- 5th nerve Neuralgia P- Palatal palsy C- CHL This occurs when malignant tumours infiltrate the lateral wall of the nasopharynx or originate in the Sinus of Morgagni (the space between the base of the skull and the superior constrictor muscle ). Structures passing through the Sinus of Morgagni are Levator veli palatini Auditory tube/eustachian tube Tensor veli palatini Ascending palatine artery Fig: Structures passing through the Sinus of Morgagni Cochlear Nerve (Option A) transmits auditory information from the cochlea to the brain. Damage to this nerve can cause hearing loss, but it is less likely to be affected directly by nasopharyngeal carcinoma compared to the Eustachian tube. Stylopharyngeus muscle (Option B) passes through the space between the superior and themiddle constrictor muscles of the pharynx. It elevates the pharynx and larynx during swallowing and speech and does not directly cause hearing loss. Tympanic Membrane (Option C) converts sound waves into vibrations. Damage or infection of the tympanic membrane typically involves direct ear infections or trauma, not nasopharyngeal carcinoma.",

      },
      "correct_answer": "D",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: D) Pharyngobasilar Fascia Explanation: Pharyngobasilar Fascia or Pharyngeal Aponeurosis is a thick fibrous layer located between the mucosa and the muscular layer and forms the inner layer. It provides structural integrity to the pharyngeal wall, especially where muscles are deficient, such as the posterior wall. It also anchors the pharynx to the skull base, ensuring firmness and support. Layers of pharyngeal wall: The pharyngeal wall consists of four layers, from innermost to outermost: Mucosal Membrane: Mucosa in the nasopharynx consists of Ciliated columnar epithelium and stratified squamous epithelium in the oropharynx and laryngopharynx. Pharyngobasilar Fascia (Pharyngeal Aponeurosis): A fibrous layer that provides structural integrity and support to the pharyngeal wall, especially in the posterior area. Muscular Layer consists of the superior, middle, and inferior constrictor muscles and they function in the peristaltic movement of the pharynx during swallowing. Buccopharyngeal Fascia (Option B) : This is the outermost layer of the pharyngeal wall. It covers the external surface of the pharyngeal muscles and is continuous with the pretracheal fascia. It also separates the pharyngeal wall from surrounding structures like the prevertebral fascia. Fig: Layers of pharyngeal wall Investing fascia (Option A) is the outermost layer of the deep cervical fascia, which encases the entire neck.

      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: C) Thyropharyngeus and cricopharyngeus Explanation: The scenario and barium swallow findings suggest Zenker’s diverticulum , an outpouching occurring at a site known as Killian’s Dehiscence (often referred to as the \"gateway of tears\"). This space is formed by the two parts of the inferior constrictor muscle: the thyropharyngeus (oblique fibres) and the cricopharyngeus (transverse fibres) . This arrangement creates a triangular gap known as Killian’s dehiscence . Zenker’s Diverticulum (Hypopharyngeal Pouch/Pharyngeal Pouch): Description An acquired, false, and pulsion diverticulum formed by the protrusion of mucosa and submucosa through Killian's dehiscence. Clinical manifestations Dysphagia Regurgitation Food getting stuck (leading to coughing while eating) Aspiration Halitosis (bad breath) Investigation Barium swallow reveals an outpouching of the pharyngeal mucosa above the upper oesophagal sphincter, often with slow emptying of the diverticulum. Management Diverticulectomy and cricopharyngeal myotomy: Surgical removal of the diverticulum and myotomy of the cricopharyngeal muscle. Diverticular suspension: Dissection and inversion of the diverticulum with its apex pointing cranially. Myotomy through stapler transection: Transoral insertion of a linear stapler to divide the septum between the diverticulum and the true oesophagal lumen. Dohlman Procedure: Endoscopic technique involving division of the diverticulum wall and cricopharyngeal myotomy.",
