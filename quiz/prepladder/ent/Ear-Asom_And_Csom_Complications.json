      },
      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: C) Mastoiditis Explanation: Mastoiditis is the most common extracranial complication of Acute Otitis Media (AOM) because the infection can spread from the middle ear to the mastoid bone, leading to inflammation and infection of the mastoid air cells. This condition often requires prompt treatment to prevent further complications. Symptoms include swelling behind the ear, fever, and ear pain. Extracranial complications Acute Mastoiditis: Disease progresses from the middle ear to the mastoid bone via the aditus. Labyrinthitis: Disease progresses from the middle ear to the inner ear. Facial Nerve Palsy: Disease progresses to the internal auditory meatus or along the course of the facial nerve, leading to facial nerve palsy. Petrositis: Infection progresses towards the apex of the petrous bone, causing petrositis. Osteomyelitis: Involves the squamous portion of the temporal bone. Septicemia: Infection spreads to the bloodstream, resulting in septicemia. Labyrinthitis, facial nerve palsy, and septicemia are less common complications of AOM compared to mastoiditis (Options A, B & D) Reference: Dhingra Diseases of Ear, Nose and Throat and Head and Neck Surgery, 8th Edition, Page 91-97",

      },
      "correct_answer": "D",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: D) Pinna usually pushed backwards and upwards. Explanation: Acute Mastoiditis: Definition: Inflammation of the mucosal lining of the mastoid air cells due to infection spreading from acute otitis media, involving the bony walls of the mastoid air-cell system. Aetiology Primary Cause: Follows or accompanies acute suppurative otitis media. Determining Factors: High virulence of organisms or lowered patient resistance (e.g., measles, exanthematous fevers, poor nutrition, systemic diseases like diabetes). Common Organisms: Beta-haemolytic streptococcus is most common. Clinical Features: Symptoms: Persistent or worsening pain behind the ear. Persistent or recurrent fever despite antibiotics (Option A) . Increased, profuse, or obstructed ear discharge. Signs: Ironed Out Appearance of the Mastoid: First sign of acute mastoiditis:Due to inflammation of the mastoid periosteum. Mastoid tenderness. Mucopurulent or purulent ear discharge. Sagging of posterosuperior meatal wall (Option C) . Tympanic membrane perforation or dullness. Swelling over the mastoid (Option B) . Pushes the pinna forward and downwards.

        "D": "Cavity formation; Antibiotics"
      },
      "correct_answer": "D",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: D) Cavity formation; Antibiotics. Explanation: This presentation is consistent with acute mastoiditis, where the CT scan would typically show cavity formation due to pus accumulation in the mastoid air cells. The most appropriate treatment involves starting broad-spectrum antibiotics to manage the infection and performing a myringotomy to relieve pressure. Acute mastoiditis Investigations Blood Counts: Polymorphonuclear leucocytosis. Erythrocyte Sedimentation Rate: Elevated. CT Scan: Clouding of air cells, indistinct bony partitions, potential cavity formation (Options A, B & C) Ear Swab: Culture and sensitivity for aerobic and anaerobic organisms. Treatment Hospitalization: Required for management. Antibiotics: Start with amoxicillin or ampicillin; adjust based on sensitivity report. Include metronidazole if anaerobes are present. Myringotomy: To relieve pus under tension; often combined with antibiotic treatment. Treatment of Choice: Cortical Mastoidectomy (Schwartz Operation) Also known as Intact Canal Wall Mastoidectomy Procedure: Remove all mastoid air cells Create a single cavity Landmarks: Tegmen Sigmoid sinus Tip of the mastoid Bulge of the lateral semicircular canal All these landmarks should be visible if the patient has undergone cortical mastoidectomy First figure depicts left temporal bone showing cortical mastoidectomy showing facial nerve (white arrow) in the deepest part of the posterior canal wall. Second figure is an illustrative picture showing structures in dissected temporal bone (yellow line: facial nerve, blue line: sigmoid sinus bulge and pink dotted line: dural or tegmen plate).

      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: B) External rectus palsy, retro-orbital pain, and Ear discharge Explanation: Gradenigo Syndrome is characterized by a triad of symptoms due to petrous apicitis: external rectus palsy (which causes eye movement difficulties), retro-orbital pain (deep pain behind the eye), and persistent ear discharge. These symptoms result from the spread of infection from the middle ear to the petrous apex of the temporal bone. Petrositis (Petrous Apicitis) Definition: Infection spreading from the middle ear and mastoid to the petrous part of the temporal bone is known as petrositis. Clinical Features: Gradenigo Syndrome - Classic triad: External rectus palsy (VIth nerve palsy). Deep-seated ear or retro-orbital pain (Vth nerve involvement). Persistent ear discharge. Additional Symptoms: Persistent ear discharge despite mastoidectomy. Fever, headache, vomiting, neck rigidity. Facial paralysis and recurrent vertigo may occur. Diagnosis: Imaging: CT Scan: Shows bony details and air cells. MRI: Differentiates between diploic marrow and fluid/pus. Treatment: Surgical Intervention: Mastoidectomy: Cortical, modified radical, or radical, depending on the extent. Fistulous Tract Management: Curettage and enlargement for drainage. Approach: Posterosuperior Cells: Found in Trautmann’s triangle or attic. Anterior Cells: Near the eustachian tube, above the carotid artery, anterior to the cochlea; may require radical mastoidectomy. Transcochlear/ Translabyrinthine Approach: If hearing loss is complete. IIIIIII Fig: Trautmann’s triangle Antibacterial Therapy: High doses initially, continued for 4-5 days post-symptom resolution. Often sufficient for acute cases without surgery. Fever, facial swelling, and hearing loss (Option A): These signs are not specific to Gradenigo Syndrome. Nausea, vertigo, and tinnitus (Option C): These signs are typical of vestibular disorders Headache, neck stiffness, and photophobia (Option D): They are rather the signs of meningitis",

      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: A) CSOM with cholesteatoma Explanation: Circumscribed Labyrinthitis is the most probable diagnosis in this scenario. The most common cause is chronic suppurative otitis media with cholesteatoma which leads to thinning or erosion of the bony capsule of the labyrinth, usually of the horizontal semicircular canal. Labyrinthitis: Inflammation of the labyrinth It is of three types: Circumscribed Diffuse serous Diffuse suppurative Pathology Thinning or erosion of the bony capsule of the labyrinth Most commonly horizontal semicircula r canal is involved Diffuse intralabyrinthine inflammation without pus formation It is reversible Diffuse pyogenic infection of the labyrinth. Permanent loss of vestibular and cochlear functions Etiology Most common: Chronic suppurative otitis media with cholesteatoma (Option A) Neoplasms of the middle ear like carcinoma or glomus tumour (Option D ruled out) Surgical or accidental trauma Most common: progression of preexisting circumscribed labyrinthitis associated with chronic middle ear suppuration or cholesteatoma. Acute otitis media (Option B ruled out) Following a stapedectomy or fenestration operation Progression of serous labyrinthitis associated with pyogenic organisms (Option C ruled out) Clinical manifestations Transient nystagmus and vertigo induced by pressure on the tragus, cleaning the ear, or Valsalva maneuver Fistula sign is positive Vertigo (single long episode) with sensorineural hearing loss. Severe vertigo with nausea and vomiting Total sensorineural hearing loss Nystagmus Positive pressure- nystagmus to the same side Negative pressure- nystagmus to the opposite side Nystagmus to the affected side Nystagmus to the opposite side Treatment Management of the cause Antibacterial therapy Labyrinthine sedatives Surgery: Cortical mastoidectomy or modified radical mastoidectomy It is the same as diffuse serous labyrinthitis Drainage of the labyrinth to evacuate the pus Reference: Dhingra Diseases of Ear, Nose and Throat and Head and Neck Surgery, 8th Edition, Page 96, 97",
