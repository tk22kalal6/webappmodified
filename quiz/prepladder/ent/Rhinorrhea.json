      },
      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Correct answer: C) Perennial allergic rhinitis Explanation: Perennial allergic rhinitis is most commonly triggered by allergens present all year , such as pet dander and mould, which the patient is exposed to continuously. The persistent nature of the symptoms points to this diagnosis. Pathophysiology of Allergic Rhinitis Sensitisation: Re-exposure and Immediate Response: Upon subsequent exposure to the same allergen, IgE cross-links on mast cells, causing degranulation. Histamine, leukotrienes, and prostaglandins are released. Early Phase Symptoms: Histamine: Causes vasodilation, increased mucus secretion, and itching. Leukotrienes: Contribute to nasal congestion. Prostaglandin D2: Further enhances congestion and rhinorrhea. Late Phase Response: Recruitment of inflammatory cells (eosinophils, neutrophils, and T-cells). Eosinophils release mediators that perpetuate inflammation. Chronic Inflammation: Continuous exposure to allergens leads to prolonged nasal congestion, rhinorrhea, sneezing, and itching due to ongoing inflammation. Seasonal allergic rhinitis is triggered by pollen, which only causes symptoms during specific times of the year, such as spring or fall. Since the patient experiences symptoms year-round, this is unlikely. (Option A) Non-allergic rhinitis is caused by irritants such as strong odours, smoke, or weather changes, but it does not involve an allergic reaction to specific triggers like mould or pet dander. The presence of allergen exposure in this patient makes this option less likely. (Option B) Although Allergic asthma (Option D) asthma can coexist with allergic rhinitis and be triggered by similar allergens, asthma primarily involves respiratory symptoms such as wheezing and shortness of breath, which are not part of this patient’s presentation.",

      "explanation": "Correct answer: D) Allergic salute Explanation: Allergic salute describes the horizontal crease that forms on the middle of the dorsum of the nose due to the repeated action of rubbing to relieve itching, a common behaviour in people with allergic rhinitis. Allergic salute Allergic Rhinitis Symptoms Signs Watery Nasal Discharge. Nasal Obstruction Sneezing Nasal Itching Itching in the Eyes, Palate, and Pharynx Nasal Signs: Transverse Nasal Crease Pale and Swollen Nasal Mucosa Swollen Turbinates Ocular Signs: Eyelid Swelling Conjunctival Congestion (Cobble-stone appearance), associated with VKC Dark Circles ('Allergic Shiners') Otologic Signs: Retracted Tympanic Membrane Serous Otitis Media Pharyngeal Signs: Granular Pharyngitis Laryngeal Signs: Hoarseness Laryngeal Oedema Granular pharyngitis (Option A): This refers to inflammation and swelling in the throat's lymphoid tissue, which is not caused by facial rubbing. Erythematous conjunctiva (Option B): This sign involves redness and inflammation of the eye membranes, often seen in allergic reactions, but is not related to the action of rubbing the face. Allergic shiners (Option C): These are dark circles under the eyes resulting from congestion and swelling due to allergic reactions, but they are not caused by rubbing the face.

      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Correct answer: B) Skin Prick Test Explanation: Skin prick test involves placing drops of allergen extracts on the skin and making small punctures to introduce the allergens. A localized reaction, such as a central wheal surrounded by a zone of erythema, indicates sensitivity to the specific allergens. It is widely recognized as the most effective test for pinpointing the exact allergens causing allergic rhinitis. Skin Prick Test Nasal smear (Option A) involves examining a sample of nasal secretions under a microscope to identify the presence of eosinophils. While it can support the diagnosis of allergic rhinitis by showing eosinophil predominance, it does not identify specific allergens causing the symptoms. Complete Blood Count (Option C): This test helps evaluate general health and detect eosinophilia, which may be associated with allergic conditions. However, it does not specify which allergens are responsible for the symptoms. Serum IgE (Option D): This blood test measures the levels of IgE which is elevated in allergic rhinitis but, it does not provide immediate, practical results about allergen triggers like the skin prick test.",

      },
      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: A) Add intranasal corticosteroids Explanation: For patients with moderate to severe or persistent symptoms of allergic rhinitis, and no improvement on oral antihistaminics, intranasal corticosteroids are recommended as monotherapy and are the next step in management according to ARIA guidelines. Treatment of Allergic Rhinitis: Treatment Type Details Notes Allergen Avoidance Avoidance of identified allergens. Remove pets, encase bedding, and change diet Most effective but not always practical Drug Therapy Antihistamines : Controls rhinorrhoea, sneezing, and itching. Diphenhydramine, Cetirizine Sympathomimetics : Reduces nasal congestion. Pseudoephedrine, Phenylephrine Corticosteroids : For acute episodes. Prednisone Sodium Cromoglycate : Stabilises mast cells. Cromolyn sodium Anticholinergics: Blocks rhinorrhoea. Eg. Ipratropium bromide Leukotriene Receptor Antagonists: Montelukast Anti-IgE: Omalizumab Drowsiness with antihistamines; limited use of corticosteroids due to side effects Immunotherapy Gradually increasing doses of allergens to suppress IgE formation and boost IgG. Allergen-specific injections or sublingual tablets Used when drug therapy is ineffective or not tolerated ARIA Step-Care Approach: Disease Severity Treatment Options Mild Intermittent Disease Oral antihistamines, intranasal cromolyn sodium Moderate Severity/Persistent Disease Intranasal corticosteroids Severe Symptoms Oral non-sedating antihistamines + intranasal steroids Severe Persistent Symptoms Short course oral steroids + immunotherapy Persistent Nasal Obstruction Short course intranasal/oral decongestants (with antihistamines for oral) Complications of Allergic Rhinitis: Sinusitis Nasal Polyps Serous Otitis Media Bronchial Asthma Orthodontic Problems/Mouth Breathing Start a short course of oral corticosteroids (Option B): This is considered in severe persistent symptoms unresponsive to other treatments but not as a first escalation step. Begin immunotherapy (Option C): This is considered when drug therapy fails or causes intolerable side effects but is not the immediate next step. Use intranasal ipratropium bromide (Option D): This is effective for blocking rhinorrhoea but is not the first-line treatment for persistent nasal obstruction.

      "question": "A 45 y/o woman with a long-standing history of non-allergic rhinitis presents with persistent nasal obstruction and rhinorrhoea that has not responded to antihistamines and nasal steroid sprays. Which of the following would be the next best step in managing her condition?",
      "options": {

        "D": "Psychological support and tranquillisers"
      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "spray Correct Answer: B) Start systemic steroids for a short period and add ipratropium bromide nasal spray Explanation: Systemic Steroids are appropriate for severe cases when topical treatments have failed. They offer broader anti-inflammatory effects that can help control symptoms more effectively. Ipratropium Bromide Nasal Spray is specifically useful for managing excessive rhinorrhea, and combining it with systemic steroids can provide comprehensive symptom relief. Non-Allergic Rhinitis: Treatment Non-allergic rhinitis presents with symptoms similar to allergic rhinitis (nasal obstruction, rhinorrhoea, sneezing) but without positive allergy tests. Treatment is categorised into medical and surgical options. Medical Treatment: Treatment Type Details Lifestyle Modifications Avoid triggers such as sudden temperature changes, humidity, air blasts, and dust. Practical changes to minimise symptom triggers Pharmacological Management Antihistamines and Decongestants: Alleviate nasal obstruction, sneezing, and rhinorrhoea. Topical Steroid Sprays: Control Symptoms. Eg. Beclomethasone dipropionate, budesonide, fluticasone Systemic Steroids: Used for severe cases for a short time Ipratropium Bromide Nasal Spray: Effective for Excessive Rhinorrhoea. Psychological Support Address emotional factors; consider counselling and tranquillisers. Surgical Treatment: Surgical Procedure Details Examples/Notes Turbinate Reduction Reduces nasal obstruction by shrinking turbinate size; also corrects other obstructions. Submucosal diathermy, resection, cryosurgery, turbinectomy, cauterisation, laser, coblation, radiofrequency. Vidian Neurectomy Considered for persistent excessive rhinorrhoea despite medical therapy. It involves sectioning parasympathetic secretomotor fibres to the nose. Increase the dose of topical steroid sprays (Option A): This might help control symptoms, but it has already been tried without sufficient relief. Vidian Neurectomy (Option C) is a surgical procedure, used for severe non-allergic rhinitis resistant to medical management, that involves cutting parasympathetic nerves to reduce nasal secretions. It is generally considered only after other treatments have failed, so it is not suitable as a first-line option. Psychological Support and tranquillizers (Option D) can be beneficial for managing emotional distress associated with chronic symptoms, but they do not address the underlying physical symptoms of non-allergic rhinitis. The primary focus should be on managing the physical symptoms before considering psychological interventions.",

      "question": "A 16 y/o girl presents with a foul-smelling nasal discharge, nasal obstruction, and anosmia. She has noticeable atrophy of the nasal turbinates and pale nasal mucosa. O/E the nasal chambers are enlarged and roomy. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?",
      "options": {

        "C": "Primary atrophic rhinitis.",
        "D": "Rhinitis sicca."
      },
      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: C) Primary atrophic rhinitis. Explanation: The clinical presentation of foul-smelling nasal discharge, nasal obstruction, anosmia, atrophy of the nasal turbinates, pale nasal mucosa, and enlarged, roomy nasal chambers in a 16-year-old girl is most consistent with primary atrophic rhinitis. Atrophic rhinitis, or ozaena, is a chronic inflammatory nasal condition classified into primary and secondary types. Primary Atrophic Rhinitis: Aspect Details Causes Heredity Endocrine disturbance Racial factors Nutritional deficiency Infective: Klebsiella ozaenae Autoimmune Clinical Features And Examination findings Primarily affects females, starts around puberty Foul-smelling nasal discharge; patients are usually unaware of it themselves and have anosmia (merciful anosmia). Paradoxical nasal obstruction despite enlarged nasal chambers. Epistaxis from crust removal. Pale nasal mucosa, atrophied turbinates, potential septal perforation, nasal vestibule dermatitis, saddle nose deformity. Possible extension to pharynx and larynx leading to atrophic pharyngitis and laryngitis. Eustachian tube obstruction and middle ear effusion cause hearing impairment. Secondary Atrophic Rhinitis: Aspect Details Causes Specific infections: Syphilis, lupus, leprosy, rhinoscleroma Chronic purulent sinusitis Radiation therapy: To nose and sinuses Excessive turbinate removal surgery: Empty nose syndrome Extreme septal deviation: Causing unilateral atrophic rhinitis on wider side Clinical Features Similar to primary atrophic rhinitis Presence of features related to underlying cause (e.g., syphilis, lupus) Secondary atrophic rhinitis (Option A) is usually due to another underlying cause and does not typically present with such pronounced atrophy and nasal chamber enlargement. Vasomotor rhinitis (Option B) generally causes nasal congestion and discharge but is not associated with atrophy of the turbinates or foul-smelling discharge. Rhinitis sicca (Option D) or dry rhinitis, involves dryness rather than the atrophic changes and foul-smelling discharge described here.

      "question": "A 45-year-old patient presents with persistent nasal crusting and foul odour, unresponsive to medical treatment. Which procedure narrows the nasal cavity to reduce crusting?",
      "options": {
        "A": "Young's operation",

        "C": "Nasal irrigation with an alkaline solution",
        "D": "Lautenschlaeger technique"
      },
      "correct_answer": "D",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: D) Lautenschlaeger technique Explanation: The patient is diagnosed with atrophic rhinitis , which is characterized by persistent nasal crusting and a foul odour due to the atrophy of the nasal mucosa. The Lautenschlaeger technique specifically involves medial displacement of the lateral nasal wall to narrow the nasal cavities, which can help reduce crusting by improving airflow and humidifying the nasal passages in patients with atrophic rhinitis. Treatment of Atrophic Rhinitis: Treatment focuses on symptom management, especially foul smell and crusting, and aims to improve quality of life. Both medical and surgical approaches are used. Medical Treatment: Treatment Details Nasal Irrigation and Crust Removal Use warm normal saline or an alkaline solution for nasal irrigation. Irrigate multiple times daily initially, reducing to once every 2-3 days as symptoms improve. For stubborn crusts, use glucose-glycerin solution before removal with forceps or suction. Topical Applications Apply 25% glucose in glycerine to inhibit proteolytic bacteria growth, reducing foul smell. Antibiotics Systemic antibiotics (e.g., fluoroquinolones with metronidazole) for 7-10 days. Long-term use is not recommended. Other Therapies Mucolytics: Potassium iodide solutions to liquefy secretions. Experimental: Oestradiol nasal sprays and submucosal placental extract injections have been explored. Dietary Recommendations A balanced diet rich in vitamins A, D, folic acid, iron, and protein to support overall health and mucosal recovery. Surgical Treatment: Procedure Details Young's Operation and Modifications Complete closure of both nostrils in the nasal vestibule. Reopen nostrils after approximately 6 months to encourage mucosal regeneration and reduce crusting. Modified versions partially close nostrils to reduce discomfort while aiming for similar benefits. Techniques to narrow excessively wide nasal chambers Autologous grafts (fat, cartilage, bone) placed under the mucoperiosteum of nasal floor/lateral walls or mucoperichondrium of septum. Allografts (Alloderm, Cymetra) can be used. The Lautenschlaeger technique involves medial displacement of the lateral nasal wall to narrow nasal cavities which can help reduce crusting by improving airflow and humidifying the nasal passages. (Option D) Young's operation and its modifications (Option A): Involves closing and then reopening the nostrils to promote mucosal regeneration and reduce crusting, not specifically for narrowing nasal cavities. Use of 25% glucose in glycerine nasal application (Option B): Helps inhibit bacterial growth and reduce odour, not related to narrowing nasal cavities. Nasal irrigation with an alkaline solution (Option C): Aimed at crust removal and odour reduction, not for narrowing nasal cavities.",

      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: A) Rhinitis Sicca Explanation: The patient’s symptoms, including crusting, bilateral involvement, and septal erosion, align with the diagnosis of Rhinitis sicca , especially given his occupation in a dry and dusty environment. Rhinitis Sicca Rhinitis Caseosa Etiology Affects individuals working in hot, dry, dusty environments (e.g., bakers, ironsmiths, goldsmiths) Uncommon, typically affects males, usually unilateral Location Confined to the anterior third of the nose, especially the nasal septum. Originates from sinuses affecting the nasal cavity unilaterally Pathology Ciliated columnar epithelium undergoes squamous metaplasia with atrophy of sero-mucinous glands. Chronic sinusitis with inspissated cheesy material; sinus mucosa becomes granulomatous. Symptoms Crust formation, ulceration, epistaxis, and possible septal perforation due to crust removal. Nose filled with offensive purulent discharge and cheesy material. The mucosa of the sinus becomes granulomatous. Treatment Improve occupational surroundings Apply bland or antibiotic/steroid ointment. Avoid nose picking/removal of crusts. Use nasal douche. Removal of debris, and granulation tissue, and ensuring free drainage of the affected sinus. Rhinitis Caseosa (Option B): This condition typically presents unilaterally with offensive purulent discharge, unlike the patient's bilateral nasal crusting and septal erosion. Chronic sinusitis (Option C): Although it may involve crusting and discharge, it usually affects both nostrils and is less specific to the occupational setting described. Allergic rhinitis (Option D): This condition generally causes itchy, watery discharge and is not associated with the characteristic crusting and offensive odour described.

      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: B) Cribriform plate Explanation: Cribriform plate is a common site for CSF leakage, particularly in cases of head trauma, making it a likely source of the patient’s symptoms. CSF Rhinorrhea: Leakage of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) into the nose. Can present as clear fluid or mixed with blood , especially in acute head injuries. Common Sites of CSF Rhinorrhea : Anterior cranial fossa Middle cranial fossa Temporal bone fracture Cribriform plate(most common) Roof of ethmoid air cells Frontal sinus Sphenoid sinus(following trauma) CSF reaches the middle ear, escaping through the eustachian tube into the nose (CSF otorhinorrhea) Aetiology Trauma(Most common): Accidental or surgical (e.g., sinus surgery, nasal polypectomy, skull base surgery). Inflammations: Mucocoeles, fungal infections, osteomyelitis, sinus polyposis. Neoplasms: Benign and malignant tumours invading the skull base. Congenital: Meningocele, meningoencephaloceles, gliomas with skull base defects. Idiopathic: Spontaneous leaks with no known cause. Investigations for CSF Rhinorrhea Handkerchief test (Halo sign): Simple bedside test; CSF forms clear halo around blood spot. Beta-2 transferrin: Gold standard biochemical test; highly specific for CSF. High-Resolution CT (HRCT): Identifies bony defects in skull base. CT Cisternography: Contrast-enhanced; precise localization of active CSF leaks. MRI Cisternography: Non-invasive; useful for identifying meningoceles/encephaloceles. Fluorescein Test: Intrathecal dye injection; helps in intraoperative leak localization. Roof of the ethmoid air cells(Option A), Frontal sinus(Option C), and Sphenoid sinus(Option D): While these are possible sites of CSF leakage following head trauma, they are less commonly injured when compared to the cribriform plate.

      "explanation": "Correct Answer: C)Presence of Beta-2 transferrin and high sugar content in the fluid Explanation: Given the presentation of clear, watery nasal discharge in a patient with a history of head injury, a cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) leak is a likely diagnosis. Features CSF rhinorrhea Simple rhinorrhea History Nasal or sinus surgery Head injury Intracranial tumour Sneezing Nasal stuffiness. Itching in the nose/lacrimation. Flow of discharge A few drops or a stream of fluid gushes down when bending forward or straining, cannot be sniffed back.

Taste Sweet (Option B) Salty Sugar content More than 30gm/dl Less than 10mg/dl Presence of Beta-2 Transferrin Always present, specific for CSF. Always absent. Sniff Test- In CSF rhinorrhea, the discharge gushes out in drops when bending and cannot be sniffed back, unlike nasal discharge from allergic or vasomotor rhinitis. Halo Sign: Seen in CSF rhinorrhea after head trauma. When collected on filter paper, the fluid shows a double target sign: a central red spot (blood) and a lighter peripheral halo (CSF). Halo Sign Reservoir Sign- Clear, watery discharge occurs when the patient bends their head, typically in the morning, as CSF collected in the sinuses (especially sphenoid) empties into the nose. Handkerchief Test- Nasal discharge from rhinitis stiffens the handkerchief due to its mucus content, whereas CSF does not cause stiffening. (Option D)",

      "explanation": "Correct Answer: B) Beta-2 transferrin test Explanation: In this case, the patient’s symptoms of clear, watery nasal discharge that worsens when bending forward after nasal surgery are classic indicators of CSF rhinorrhea. The Beta-2 transferrin test is highly specific and sensitive for detecting CSF in nasal discharge, making it the best confirmatory test for this patient’s symptoms. CSF Rhinorrhea - Biochemical Tests Glucose estimation test Beta-2 Transferrin test Beta trace protein test Rapid but unreliable test using glucose oxidase paper. Not specific for the site or side of the leak. A protein unique to CSF, not found in nasal discharge. Its presence is a specific and sensitive test for CSF rhinorrhea. Requires only a few drops of CSF for testing. Found in CSF, perilymph, and aqueous humor. The best test for confirming CSF in nasal fluid, but doesn’t localize the leak. Another protein-specific test to detect CSF. Secreted by the meninges and choroid plexus. Also known as prostaglandin D synthase. High sensitivity and specificity. Present in other tissues (testes, heart) and altered in conditions like renal failure and CNS diseases. But, facilities to test these are not easily available. (Option D) Glucose oxidase paper test(Option A): This test is unreliable for detecting CSF rhinorrhea due to potential false positives from other substances and false negatives if glucose levels in CSF are low or if there is active meningitis. Lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) test(Option C): LDH is a non-specific enzyme that is not suitable for diagnosing CSF rhinorrhea as it does not differentiate between CSF and other fluids in the nasal cavity.

      "explanation": "Correct Answer: B) High-Resolution CT (HRCT) Explanation: The clinical scenario describes a clear nasal discharge that worsens with bending forward which is a classic sign of CSF leak. HRCT is the investigation of choice for identifying skull base defects associated with CSF rhinorrhea, especially following trauma, as it provides excellent visualization of bone structures and defects. Radiological Examination for CSF Rhinorrhea High-Resolution CT(HRCT) Investigation of choice for identifying skull base defects. 3D reconstruction helps evaluate congenital or spontaneous defects. Useful for detecting trauma, developmental abnormalities, or erosive lesions. CT Cisternography Involves intrathecal contrast injection to localize the CSF leak. Improves diagnostic yield, especially in active leaks. May miss cribriform or ethmoid sinus defects. Invasive procedure with potential side effects like nausea and headaches. MRI (Option B) Not first-line unless encephalocele is suspected. Less effective for identifying bony defects compared to CT. More costly and time-consuming; and may require a contrast agent. CT cisternography(Option C) involves intrathecal contrast and is more invasive, reserved for difficult cases when the leak site isn't found by HRCT. X-ray of the skull(Option D) has limited value in detecting CSF leaks or skull base defects.

      "explanation": "Correct Answer: B) Transnasal endoscopic repair Explanation: Persistent clear, watery nasal discharge and a positive beta-2 transferrin test after head trauma indicates a cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) leak. This patient is thus diagnosed as a case of CSF Rhinorrhoea. The cribriform plate in the in the anterior cranial fossa is usually the most commoly injured site. Transnasal endoscopic repair is the most appropriate next step for managing CSF rhinorrhea, especially for leaks in the anterior cranial fossa. The transnasal endoscopic approach allows direct visualization and repair of the defect with grafting materials and high-antibiotic nasal packing, addressing the leak effectively. Treatment of CSF Rhinorrhoea: Conservative Management: Bed rest, head elevation. Stool softeners, avoidance of nose blowing, sneezing, and straining. Prophylactic antibiotics to prevent meningitis. Acetazolamide to decrease CSF formation. Lumbar drain if indicated. Surgical Repair Approaches: Neurosurgical Intracranial Approach. Extradural Approaches (rarely used): External ethmoidectomy (cribriform plate/ethmoid area). Transseptal sphenoidal approach. Osteoplastic flap (frontal sinus leaks). Transnasal Endoscopic Approach (preferred for anterior cranial fossa and sphenoid sinus): Site identification (e.g., cribriform plate, sphenoid, ethmoid roof) Grafting with fascia, and cartilage for large defects (>2 cm), followed by mucosa placement Use of Surgicel and Gelfoam to further strengthen the area. High-antibiotic nasal packing Lumbar drain for high CSF pressure Frontal Sinus Leaks: May require osteoplastic flap and sinus obliteration with fat. External ethmoidectomy (Option A) is rarely used for CSF leaks and is typically reserved for specific cases involving defects in the ethmoid area. It is not the preferred approach for anterior cranial fossa leaks, which are more common in head trauma cases presenting with CSF rhinorrhea. Osteoplastic flap and sinus obliteration (Option C) are generally used for managing frontal sinus leaks, involving more invasive procedures to reconstruct and obliterate the sinus to prevent further leakage. It is not indicated for CSF leaks unless there is specific involvement of the frontal sinus. Lumbar drain (Option D): While a lumbar drain is used to manage high CSF pressure and may aid in conservative management, it is not a definitive surgical solution. Since conservative measures have already been exhausted, the next step should be a surgical intervention to repair the leak directly.",
