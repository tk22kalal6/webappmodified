      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: B) Episodic vertigo with fluctuating hearing loss and tinnitus Explanation: Meniere’s disease is most characterised by episodic vertigo, fluctuating hearing loss, and tinnitus. Meniere’s disease/Endolymphatic hydrops : An inner ear disorder is characterised by the excessive buildup of endolymph fluid. Age/Sex: Typically affects individuals aged 35-60, with a higher prevalence in males. Cardinal Symptoms : Vertigo Episodic with sudden onset Attacks occur in clusters, interspersed with periods of remission accompanied by nausea, vomiting, ataxia & nystagmus. Loud noises might trigger vertigo due to the Tullio phenomenon. Hearing Loss Fluctuating hearing loss may improve between attacks but may progressively worsen over time, with some degree of permanent hearing loss. Sensorineural hearing loss initially affecting lower frequencies . Patients might experience distorted hearing or Diplacusis Tinnitus Low-pitched & Roaring type It can be aggravated during acute attacks and might persist during periods of remission Aural Fullness Fluctuates & may vary in intensity Emotional Impact The recurrent nature of symptoms can lead to emotional stress and apprehension about future attacks, contributing to overall distress. Variants of Meniers’s disease: Cochlear Hydrops: Only cochlear symptoms are present initially; vertigo develops later. Vestibular Hydrops: Episodic vertigo without cochlear symptoms Drop Attacks (Tumarkin’s Crisis): Sudden drop attacks without loss of consciousness & without vertigo/fluctuations in hearing loss. Lermoyez Syndrome: Hearing loss followed by vertigo, with hearing recovery during vertigo. Reference: Diseases of Ear, Nose, Throat - PL Dhingra, 8th edition, Pg - 119,120",

      "question": "A 45-year-old male patient presents with episodes of vertigo, fluctuating hearing loss, tinnitus, and aural fullness. Which of the following mechanisms is associated with the pathogenesis of this condition?",
      "options": {
        "A": "Excessive production of perilymph fluid",
        "B": "Defective absorption of endolymph",
        "C": "Dilatation of the internal auditory artery",
        "D": "Vestibular nerve degeneration"
      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: B) Defective absorption of endolymph Explanation: The given scenario is suggestive of Meniere’s disease, which is primarily associated with increased endolymph volume within the inner ear resulting from defective absorption/increased production of endolymph leading to increased endolymphatic pressure, which manifests as vertigo, fluctuating hearing loss, tinnitus, and aural fullness. Etiopathogenesis of Meniere’s disease: Aetiology: Increased Endolymph Volume (Option A) Defective Absorption (Option B) Vasomotor Disturbances: Sympathetic overactivity causing spasms in the internal auditory artery (Option C) may disrupt cochlear or vestibular function, leading to vertigo and hearing loss. Allergy: Allergic reactions may cause the inner ear to produce excess endolymph. Many patients with Meniere’s disease have related allergies. Sodium and Water Retention: Excess fluid retention can exacerbate endolymphatic hydrops, so reducing salt intake is recommended. Hypothyroidism (Option D) : A small percentage of cases are linked to hypothyroidism and can improve with thyroid replacement therapy. Autoimmune and Viral Factors (Herpes family) Pathology: Meniere’s disease is characterised by distension of the endolymphatic system, particularly affecting the cochlear duct (scala media) and saccule, with possible involvement of the utricle and semicircular canals. The cochlear duct can expand, pushing the Reissner's membrane into the scala vestibuli, potentially leading to the rupture of this membrane and mixing of perilymph with endolymph causing the classic symptoms.",

      "question": "A 52-year-old patient is evaluated for symptoms of recurrent vertigo, fluctuating hearing loss, and a feeling of fullness in the ear. After a comprehensive assessment, which diagnostic test is most definitive for confirming Meniere’s disease?",
      "options": {
        "A": "Pure Tone Audiometry",
        "B": "Speech Audiometry",
        "C": "Electrocochleography",
        "D": "Glycerol Test"
      },
      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: C) Electrocochleography Explanation: Electrocochleography is useful for diagnosing Meniere’s disease due to its ability to show an elevated summating potential to action potential ratio . While tests like pure tone audiometry and the glycerol test provide supportive information, electrocochleography offers specific diagnostic criteria. Investigations of Meniere’s Disease Pure Tone Audiometry Measures hearing sensitivity across various frequencies. Sensorineural hearing loss affects lower frequencies , resulting in a rising audiogram curve. Speech Audiometry Assesses the ability to understand and discriminate speech. Scores typically range from 55%-85% between attacks but worsen significantly during and immediately after an attack, with normal scores (90%-100%) in unaffected periods. Special Audiometric Tests Help differentiate Cochlear from Retrocochlear lesions Recruitment Test : Positive in Meniere’s disease, indicating increased sensitivity to sound. Short Increment Sensitivity Index (SISI) Test : Scores greater than 70% in about two-thirds of Meniere’s patients (normal score is 15%). Tone Decay Test : Normally shows less than 20 dB decay, indicating a cochlear issue. Electrocochleography (Diagnostic) Measures the electrical potentials from the inner ear in response to sound. In normal ears, the summating potential (SP) to action potential (AP) ratio is around 30%, while in Meniere’s disease, it is >30%. Caloric Test Assesses the function of the vestibular system by irrigating the ear canal with warm or cold water. Typically, it shows reduced response on the affected side in about 75% of cases. Glycerol Test Evaluates the effect of glycerol in reducing endolymphatic pressure. A positive result is indicated by: 10 dB improvement in two or more adjacent octaves 10% increase in speech discrimination score. Improvement in tinnitus and ear fullness.

      "question": "In MRI with gadolinium contrast for Meniere’s disease, which of the following findings is typical?",
      "options": {
        "A": "Gadolinium in scala vestibuli & absent in scala tympani",
        "B": "Gadolinium is present in all three compartments",

        "D": "Gadolinium in the cochlear duct only"
      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: B) Gadolinium is present in all three compartments Explanation: In Meniere’s disease, gadolinium contrast typically shows up in all cochlear compartments (scala vestibuli, scala tympani, and scala media) due to the rupture of the Reissner's membrane , allowing gadolinium to mix with the endolymph. MRI with Gadolinium Contrast in Meniere’s Disease: Gadolinium-based contrast agents in MRI differentiate between perilymphatic and endolymphatic spaces, aiding in the diagnosis of endolymphatic hydrops, a hallmark of Meniere’s disease. Gadolinium Injection : Administered either intravenously 4 hours before MRI or intratympanically 24 hours before the scan. Normal Findings : In healthy ears , gadolinium loads into the perilymphatic space but does not enter the endolymph. In Meniere’s , gadolinium is present in all three compartments due to the rupture of Reissner’s membrane. Diagnostic Threshold : Endolymphatic space enlargement > 33% is considered abnormal Reference: Scott Brown ENT, 8th Edition, Pg - 821",

      "question": "A 45-year-old man presents with vertigo triggered by loud noises. His medical history includes a surgical fenestration for a middle ear condition. Audiometric tests are within normal limits, but vestibular testing reveals abnormal pressure responses. What is the most likely diagnosis?",
      "options": {
        "A": "Hennebert’s Sign",
        "B": "Tullio Phenomenon",
        "C": "Lhermitte’s Sign",
        "D": "Meniere’s Disease"
      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: B) Tullio Phenomenon Explanation: Tullio phenomenon is characterised by vertigo, dizziness, or imbalance triggered by loud sounds . This occurs due to an abnormal third window effect in the inner ear, which could be caused by congenital conditions, trauma, or a surgical procedure like fenestration. The pressure changes from sound waves affect the balance organs, particularly the semicircular canals , causing vertigo. Hennebert’s sign (Option A) refers to vertigo or nystagmus induced by pressure changes in the ear without an underlying middle ear infection. It is seen in conditions like syphilis or Meniere’s disease , where pressure on the inner ear (e.g., via the Valsalva manoeuvre) provokes balance disturbances. Lhermitte’s sign (Option C) is an electric shock-like sensation that travels down the spine and into the limbs when the neck is flexed. It is commonly associated with multiple sclerosis or cervical cord compression. Meniere’s disease (Option D) involves episodic vertigo, tinnitus, hearing loss, and a sense of fullness in the ear. It results from excess fluid buildup in the inner ear, affecting both hearing and balance. Reference: Diseases of Ear, Nose, Throat - PL Dhingra, 8th edition, Pg 120,550.",

        "C": "Vestibular rehabilitation therapy",
        "D": "Endolymphatic sac surgery"
      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: B) Low-salt diet and diuretics Explanation: The patient presents with symptoms suggestive of Meniere’s disease , in which the first-line treatment includes lifestyle changes, such as a low-sodium diet to reduce fluid retention and diuretics like furosemide to decrease endolymphatic fluid pressure. More invasive treatments like intratympanic gentamicin (Option A) are reserved for severe cases. Vestibular rehabilitation therapy (Option C) is useful for long-term balance but not as an initial treatment. Endolymphatic sac surgery (Option D) is considered a last resort when other treatments fail. Management of Meniere's disease Treatment Category Explanation Lifestyle Modifications Low-salt diet Caffeine, alcohol, nicotine avoidance Stress management (yoga, relaxation exercises) Hydration Medications Diuretics (e.g., furosemide, hydrochlorothiazide): Decreases fluid buildup in the inner ear Vestibular sedatives (e.g., prochlorperazine): Controls symptoms of vertigo and nausea during acute attacks. Betahistine (Vertin): Acts as a vasodilator to improve blood flow to the inner ear, potentially reducing vertigo. Antihistamines (e.g., Meclizine): Provides symptomatic relief for vertigo. Intratympanic Injections Gentamicin: Used in refractory cases to destroy vestibular hair cells and reduce vertigo. Corticosteroids: Reduces inflammation in the inner ear, potentially alleviating symptoms. Surgical Options Endolymphatic sac decompression: Decreases fluid pressure within the endolymphatic system Vestibular nerve section: Severing the vestibular nerve to relieve vertigo while preserving hearing (in severe cases). Labyrinthectomy : Complete destruction of the balance organs (last resort, leads to complete hearing loss). Reference: Diseases of Ear, Nose, Throat - PL Dhingra, 8th edition, Pg 123,124.",

        "D": "Meniett device therapy"
      },
      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: A) Endolymphatic sac decompression Explanation: Endolymphatic sac decompression is typically considered when conservative and medical treatments fail. It aims to relieve fluid pressure by decompressing the endolymphatic sac while preserving hearing. S urgical management of Meniere's disease Procedure Description Purpose Decompression of the Endolymphatic Sac Reduces pressure in the endolymphatic system by decompressing the sac. Controls vertigo while preserving hearing. Endolymphatic Shunt Operation A tube is placed to connect the endolymphatic sac with the subarachnoid space to drain excess endolymph. Sacculotomy (Fick's Operation) A needle is used to puncture the saccule through the stapes footplate to decompress it. Cody's Tack Procedure A stainless steel tack is placed through the stapes footplate to allow periodic decompression of the saccule. Selective Section of the Vestibular Nerve (Option B) The vestibular nerve is cut while preserving the cochlear nerve to control vertigo. Generally, it preserves hearing but possesses the risk of hearing loss . Labyrinthectomy (Option C) Removal of the affected labyrinth leads to complete hearing loss on that side but effective control of vertigo. Controls vertigo while hearing is significantly impaired. Intermittent Low-Pressure Pulse Therapy (Meniett Device Therapy) (Option D): This is the non-invasive approach used to deliver intermittent positive pressure waves to inner ear fluids via a ventilation tube inserted through the tympanic membrane, aimed at reducing endolymph pressure. It alleviates vertigo, tinnitus, and ear fullness and improves hearing. Reference: Diseases of Ear, Nose, Throat - PL Dhingra, 8th edition, Pg 124.",

      "explanation": "Correct Answer: B) Vestibular Hydrops Explanation: The given scenario is most likely Vestibular Hydrops , as it involves vertigo without cochlear symptoms. Variants of Meniere’s disease Variant Description Pathophysiology Cochlear Hydrops Symptoms primarily involve the cochlea: fluctuating hearing loss, tinnitus, and fullness, but no vertigo. Increased fluid pressure confined to the cochlea, often due to a blockage at the ductus reuniens. Vestibular Hydrops Presents with episodic vertigo while cochlear function remains normal (no hearing loss, tinnitus, or fullness). Fluid pressure affects the vestibular structures, particularly the saccule and utricle, sparing cochlear function. Tumarkin’s Otolithic Crisis Sudden \"drop attacks\" without loss of consciousness and no vertigo or hearing loss Deformation of otolith membrane of the utricle or saccule due to change in endolymphatic pressure Lermoyez Syndrome Symptoms of Meniere’s are seen in reverse order—progressive hearing loss followed by vertigo.

Investigations of Glomus Tumour CT scan (Option A) CECT (contrast-enhanced computed tomography) is the investigation of choice to distinguish between glomus tympanicum and glomus jugulare tumours and to differentiate them from an aberrant carotid artery, a high jugular bulb, or a dehiscent jugular bulb. Phelps sign: On the normal side, the carotico-jugular spine (a dense bone structure between the jugular and mastoid) is intact. On the affected side, erosion of the carotico-jugular spine is observed. CT shows enlargement of the left jugular foramen with bone erosion (arrow) MRI scan (Option B) It demonstrates the extent of the tumour within the soft tissue. Salt and pepper sign: Microhemorrhages within the tumour are visualized as white and gray dots on MRI, resulting in a \"salt-and-pepper\" appearance. MRI shows a well-defned mass (arrow) in the left jugular foramen.

It also aids in identifying additional glomus tumors, locating feeding vessels, and guiding embolization. Brain Perfusion and Flow Studies These are essential if the tumor compresses the internal carotid artery. They assess brain perfusion, contralateral carotid artery function, and may involve xenon blood flow and isotope studies to gauge stroke risk and the need for artery replacement. Biopsy (Option C) Histopathological studies show the Zell Ballen pattern, where epithelioid chief cells and sustentacular supporting cells form clusters (Zell Ballen) encircled by extensive vascular sinusoids. Fig: Zell Ballen Appearance of Glomus Tumor Preoperative biopsy of the tumour is not performed due to the risk of profuse bleeding from its highly vascular thin-walled blood sinusoids and potential injury to the high jugular bulb or aberrant internal carotid artery.",

Management of glomus tumor Surgical excision: Mostly surgical excision is the treatment of choice in glomus tumors and it consists of Transcanal Approach For a localized glomus tympanicum tumor where the entire circumference of the tumor is visible. Hypotympanic Approach For tumors limited to the promontory and hypotympanum, a superiorly based tympanomeatal flap is elevated via a postauricular approach, and the bony inferior tympanic ring is drilled to expose the tumor's lower margin Extended Facial Recess Approach It is used for small glomus tympanicum tumors extending into the mastoid but not reaching the jugular bulb. For more extensive cases, a modified radical mastoidectomy is performed. Mastoid-Neck Approach This technique is used for glomus jugulare tumors that do not extend into the internal carotid artery, posterior cranial fossa, or neck. Infratemporal Fossa Approach (Fisch) It is employed for large glomus jugulare tumors. Transcondylar Approach Used for tumors extending to the foramen magnum, often recurrent glomus jugulare tumors, it provides access to the craniocervical junction and exposes the occipital condyle and jugular tubercle Embolization is used to reduce tumor vascularity before surgery or as the sole treatment for inoperable patients who have already undergone radiation. Radiation (Option C) does not cure the tumor but can reduce its vascularity and halt growth. It is used for inoperable tumors, residual or recurrent tumors after surgery, and for older patients where extensive skull base surgery is unsuitable.
