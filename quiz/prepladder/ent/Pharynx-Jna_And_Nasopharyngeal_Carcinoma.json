On examination, he has a large nasopharyngeal mass with invasion into the surrounding bony structures and involvement of the intracranial space. Imaging studies reveal multiple lymph nodes in the neck, some of which are greater than 6 cm in size. There is no evidence of distant metastasis . What is the TNM staging of this cancer?",

      "question": "Which of the following is the common symptom of juvenile nasopharyngeal angiofibroma?",

      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: B) Epistaxis Explanation Profuse, recurrent nosebleeds (epistaxis) are the hallmark symptom of juvenile nasopharyngeal angiofibroma (JNA0 and are often the first presenting sign due to the fragile, thin-walled vessels in the tumor. JNA - Clinical Features Nasal and Nasopharyngeal Symptoms Epistaxis: Recurrent , profuse nosebleeds due to fragile, thin-walled vessels. (Option B) Nasal Obstruction: Progressive blockage causing nasal voice. Nasal Discharge: Often from secondary sinusitis or obstruction. (Option D ruled out) Otologic Symptoms Conductive Hearing Loss: Eustachian tube obstruction leading to fluid in the middle ear. (Option C ruled out) Otitis Media with Effusion: Fluid build-up, possible ear pain. Ophthalmo-neurological Symptoms Proptosis: Eyeball protrusion from orbital invasion. Diplopia: Double vision due to cranial nerve compression (CN III, IV, VI). (Option A ruled out) Cranial Nerve Palsies: Various deficits like vision changes (CN II), facial pain (CN V), or swallowing difficulty (CN IX, X). Facial Deformity Broadening of Nasal Bridge: Widening from tumor pressure. Cheek Swelling: Asymmetry due to tumor extension. Frog-Face Deformity: Bilateral proptosis with bulging eyes and flattened profile. Other Features Age and Sex: Predominantly affects adolescent males (10-20 years) . Rare in females or older individuals. Endoscopic Appearance: Smooth or lobulated reddish-purple mass blocking nasal passages. Consistency: Firm but should not be palpated due to bleeding risk.",

      "question": "A 17-year-old male presents with recurrent epistaxis, nasal obstruction, and a reddish-purple mass visible in the nasal cavity. He also reports occasional facial pain. CECT scan finding is shown below. Which investigation is most useful in evaluating the vascularity of this tumor and planning for preoperative embolization?",
      "options": {
        "A": "Magnetic resonance imaging",

      "correct_answer": "D",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: D) Digital Subtraction Angiography Explanation Case scenario suggests JNA and CECT shows a mass in the nasopharynx with anterior bowing of the posterior wall of the maxillary sinus (Holman-Miller sign). Digital Subtraction Angiography (DSA) is the best imaging modality to evaluate the vascularity of the tumor and to identify feeding vessels for preoperative embolization, which helps reduce intraoperative blood loss. JNA is a highly vascular tumor, primarily supplied by the internal maxillary artery , a branch of the external carotid artery. Larger lesions may involve multiple feeding arteries.The second most common source is the ascending pharyngeal artery . Examination of Juvenile nasopharyngeal angiofibroma (JNA)",
