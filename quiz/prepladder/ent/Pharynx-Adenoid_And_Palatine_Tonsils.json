Management of Adenoid Hypertrophy: Medical Management: (For Mild Cases initially) Breathing exercises Decongestant nasal drops Antihistamines for any nasal allergies Topical Nasal Steroids (Option C) may reduce adenoid size and improve related symptoms. Surgical Intervention: (Adenoidectomy) Traditional Methods: Blind curettage adenoidectomy (Option A) remains common, but it has disadvantages, including unpredictable bleeding and poor access to the choanal adenoid. Hence, Endoscopic management is currently preferred. Direct Vision Techniques: Suction Diathermy Endoscopic Coblation/Microdebridement (Option B) involves using endoscopy to visualise and allows for precise removal of obstructive adenoid tissue, addressing the underlying issue directly. KTP Laser: Associated with a higher risk of nasopharyngeal stenosis, while the gold laser has not shown this risk.

      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: C) Chronic Otitis Media Explanation: Chronic Otitis Media is a condition that might be associated with adenoid hypertrophy and can be improved by adenoidectomy, but it is not a complication of the surgery itself. Complications of Adenoidectomy: Hemorrhage : Immediate postoperative bleeding may require postnasal packing. Risk of injury: Eustachian tubes (Option D) , pharyngeal musculature, and vertebrae. Special care for Down’s syndrome patients due to potential atlantoaxial instability. Grisel’s Syndrome (Option B) : Neck pain and torticollis, possibly from atlantoaxial dislocation. Velopharyngeal Insufficiency (Option A) : Check for submucous cleft palate preoperatively. Nasopharyngeal Stenosis : Due to scarring. Recurrence : Regrowth of adenoid tissue left behind. Adenoidectomy Anesthesia General with oral endotracheal intubation. Position Rose’s position. Procedure Preparation : Insert Boyle-Davis mouth gag. Examine the nasopharynx with a tongue depressor and digital palpation. Adenoid Removal : Use a curette with a guard to engage and remove adenoids. Lateral masses are removed with smaller curettes, and any remaining tissue is extracted with punch forceps. Hemostasis : Achieved by packing the area. Persistent bleeding may require electrocoagulation or a postnasal pack for 24 hours. Endoscopic Techniques Debrider : For precise removal under endoscopic control. Coblation : Uses radiofrequency to create a plasma field for removal. Reference: Diseases of Ear, Nose, Throat, PL Dhingra, 8th Edition, Page 507 , 508",

        "D": "Persistence of the thyroglossal duct"
      },
      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: C) Remnant of the notochord Explanation: The persistence of notochordal remnants can lead to the formation of midline cystic structures in the nasopharynx, which is consistent with Thornwaldt's disease. Thornwaldt's disease Thornwaldt’s bursa is an epithelial-lined recess in the nasopharynx, representing a remnant of the attachment of the notochord to the endoderm of the pharynx during early development. Thornwaldt’s disease is characterised by a midline nasopharyngeal cyst resulting from the persistence of a remnant of the notochord. It presents with persistent postnasal discharge or crusting, nasal obstruction, dull occipital headache, low-grade fever, recurrent sore throat, obstruction to the eustachian tube and serous otitis media. Remnant of Rathke’s pouch (Option A) : Rathke’s pouch is an embryonic structure that forms the anterior lobe of the pituitary gland. Remnants of Rathke’s pouch typically result in Rathke’s cleft cysts, which are located in the sellar region of the skull and are not related to the nasopharynx. Remnants of pharyngeal clefts (Option B) usually lead to branchial cleft cysts or sinuses, which are typically located along the lateral neck or anterior border of the sternocleidomastoid muscle. They are not associated with midline cystic lesions in the nasopharynx. Persistence of the Thyroglossal Duct (Option D) : The thyroglossal duct is a temporary embryonic structure that connects the thyroid gland to the base of the tongue. It normally obliterates after development, but when it fails to do so, it can form a thyroglossal cyst , which typically appears as a midline neck mass.",

      "correct_answer": "D",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: D) Irwin moore sign Explanation: Irwin Moore Sign is characteristic of chronic tonsillitis, where pressing the anterior tonsillar pillar expresses pus from the crypts of the tonsils. This occurs due to the accumulation of debris and bacteria in the crypts, leading to chronic inflammation. Chronic Tonsillitis Aspect Explanation Definition Persistent inflammation of the tonsils due to recurrent infections or unresolved acute tonsillitis. Aetiology Recurrent bacterial (e.g., Streptococcus pyogenes , Staphylococcus aureus ) or viral infections. Pathophysiology Trapped debris in tonsillar crypts leads to chronic inflammation, hypertrophy, and fibrosis. Clinical Features Recurrent sore throat Halitosis Difficulty swallowing Enlarged tonsils with cryptic pus Tender cervical lymphadenopathy Key Sign Irwin Moore Sign: Expression of pus from tonsillar crypts on pressing the anterior tonsillar pillar. Diagnosis Clinical based on history of recurrent infections, physical exam findings, throat culture or RADT if needed. Management Conservative: Antibiotics for acute infections, Symptomatic relief by gargling with warm/salt water and NSAIDs (for pain and inflammation). Surgical: Tonsillectomy It is indicated for patients with recurrent infections,usually defined as ≥ 7 episodes of tonsillitis in 1 year, or ≥ 5 episodes/year for 2 consecutive years, or ≥ 3 episodes/year for 3 consecutive years or those with chronic tonsillitis refractory to medical management. It is also recommended for cases with complications such as peritonsillar abscess, or if chronic tonsillitis is significantly affecting the patient’s quality of life. Complications Peritonsillar abscess, rheumatic fever, post-streptococcal glomerulonephritis. Griesinger’s Sign (Option A) is characterised by pain, swelling, and tenderness over the mastoid process and is caused by the spread of infection from the middle ear to the mastoid air cells, leading to thrombophlebitis. It is indicative of mastoiditis with thrombosis of the sigmoid sinus and may suggest intracranial complications like lateral sinus thrombosis. Battle's Sign (Option B) refers to ecchymosis (bruising) over the mastoid process and is seen in basilar skull fractures, particularly involving the temporal bone. Cottle's Sign (Option C) or Cottle test is used to assess nasal obstruction. Lateral traction of the cheek (Cottle manoeuvre) improves airflow if the obstruction is due to nasal valve collapse or dysfunction, one of the common causes of functional nasal obstruction.",

      "explanation": "Correct Answer: D) Slipping of ligature Explanation: The most likely cause of bleeding in this scenario is the slipping of a ligature. During tonsillectomy, ligatures control bleeding from the tonsillar bed. If a ligature slips or becomes dislodged, it can lead to sudden bleeding, often occurring within the first 24 hours post-operatively (Reactionary hemorrhage) . This can result in hypotension and tachycardia due to blood loss. Hemorrhage is the most common complication post-tonsillectomy and is of 3 types based on the duration: Type of Hemorrhage Primary Hemorrhage Reactionary Hemorrhage Secondary Hemorrhage Duration of occurrence Immediate complication, occur at the time of surgery. Happens within first 24 hours post surgery (Immediate complication) Seen between 5th to 10th postoperative day. Causes Inadequate hemostasis or injury to the vessels (Option C) Slipping of ligature (Option D) , hypertension or the dislodging of clot. Infection (Option B) or premature separation of the membrane (Option A) Management Application of pressure, ligation or electrocoagulation of the bleeding vessels. Initially, remove the clot and apply pressure or use a vasoconstrictor. If these measures are ineffective, proceed with ligation or electrocoagulation of the bleeding vessels. Initially by Antibiotics, if bleeding persists re-exploration is done. Reference: Diseases of Ear, Nose, Throat, PL Dhingra, 8th Edition, Page 506",
