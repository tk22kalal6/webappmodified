      },
      "correct_answer": "D",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: D) Zygomatic arch Explanation: During a total maxillectomy, the surgeon typically removes the hard palate and orbital floor and often involves areas around the ethmoid sinus. However, the zygomatic arch is not typically removed unless the tumor is specifically involved. Maxillectomy: Incision: A Weber-Fergusson incision or similar approach is often used to gain access. Type Structures Removed Medial Maxillectomy Middle turbinate Inferior turbinate Ethmoid sinus Maxillary sinus. Infrastructural Maxillectomy Extends to include the upper alveolar ridge & adjoining hard palate . Subtotal Maxillectomy Removal of the entire Maxilla. Total Maxillectomy Removal of all the above structures along with the Orbital Floor . Radical Maxillectomy Total maxillectomy plus Orbital exenteration. Bony box resection involves removing the maxilla as a unit containing the tumour to ensure complete excision of cancerous tissues. This approach maintains a clear boundary between the tumour and healthy tissues. Reference: Cumming’s Review of Otorhinolaryngology, Page - 98 Scott Brown ENT, 8th Edition, Page - 83, 85",

It extends from the medial canthus of the eye to the angle of the mandible. Helps in classifying the extent and prognosis of sinonasal tumors. Ohngren’s Classification: Suprastructural Tumors (Above Ohngren’s Line): Tumors located above the line, which includes the ethmoid and frontal sinuses . Generally have a poorer prognosis . The involvement of the ethmoid and frontal sinuses often indicates a more advanced disease. Intrastructural Tumors (Below Ohngren’s Line): Tumors located below Ohngren's line, primarily involving the maxillary sinus and nasal cavity. Tumors confined below this line tend to have a better prognosis. They are usually less advanced and less likely to have spread extensively compared to those above the line.",

      },
      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: A) Kadish Classification Explanation: Kadish Classification is the most widely used system for staging olfactory neuroblastoma. Olfactory Neuroblastoma (Esthesioneuroblastoma): Originates from the Olfactory Epithelium in the upper third of the nasal cavity which is characterised by neuroblastic differentiation and can be locally aggressive with a tendency to invade adjacent structures. Bimodal peaks of incidence (10-20 years & 50-60 years) Symptoms: Early Symptoms: Unilateral nasal obstruction and epistaxis (nosebleeds). Advanced Symptoms: Tumour invades the orbit or surrounding structures, causing proptosis, headache, epiphora, diplopia, and blurred vision. Metastasis: Lymph node metastases in the neck can occur in 10-15% of cases. Diagnosis: Intranasal or Endoscopic Examination: Reveals a friable, cherry-red, polypoidal mass Highly vascular, so biopsy should be preceded by imaging studies. Imaging Studies: CT Scan: Shows tumour extent, and possible erosion of cribriform plate/orbital wall. MRI: Detects orbital or intracranial extension. Biopsy: Confirms the tumour type; it may be low-grade with pseudorosette formation or high-grade with nuclear pleomorphism but no rosette formation. Treatment: Craniofacial resection, with or without preoperative radiation or chemotherapy, followed by adjuvant radiation for advanced cases. Staging Systems: Kadish Staging System (with Morita’s Modification): Stage A Tumour limited to the nasal cavity. Stage B Tumour involving the nasal cavity and sinuses. Stage C Tumour extending beyond the nasal and paranasal sinuses. Stage D Tumor with metastasis to cervical nodes or distant sites. Other Staging Systems: Morita’s Staging System Dulguerov and Calcaterra Staging System Breslow Classification (Option B) is used for staging melanoma based on the thickness of the tumor. Ann Arbor Staging Classification (Option C) is used for staging lymphomas. Gleason Classification (Option D) is used for grading prostate cancer based on the pattern of tumor cells.

      "explanation": "Correct Answer: B) Pott's Puffy Tumour Explanation: The Patient's acute presentation, doughy swelling , and subperiosteal abscess with bone erosion are classic features of Pott's puffy tumor. Pott's Puffy Tumour: It refers to a subperiosteal abscess or cellulitis of the frontal bone, commonly associated with frontal osteomyelitis. Typically presents with headache, swelling, and sometimes a discharging frontal fistula. Fig: Pott's Puffy Tumour Pus Formation: This can occur externally under the periosteum (resulting in a soft, doughy swelling ) or internally as an extradural abscess. Complications: Intracranial Spread : The infection can spread posteriorly, potentially leading to intracranial complications, reported in 30% to 60% of cases. This spread can occur via: Erosion of the posterior table of the frontal bone Septic thrombophlebitis through diploic veins Management: Antibiotics and Drainage: High-dose antibiotics (culture-directed, covering both aerobic and anaerobic organisms) for 6–8 weeks. Drainage : Performed endoscopically/trephination of the sinus floor. Surgical Approaches: Limited Subperiosteal Abscess: Lynch Howarth brow incision may be used, though it doesn’t provide full access. Spectacle Incision: Provides good exposure to the frontal sinus but leaves a cosmetic scar. Bicoronal Scalp Incision: Complex procedure. Offers excellent access to the frontal sinus and allows for the removal of diseased bone. Riedel’s Procedure: For, Extensive anterior table osteomyelitis, which involves removing the anterior wall and floor of the frontal sinus, with reconstruction performed later to address cosmetic deformity.

      "question": "A patient who underwent Functional Endoscopic Sinus Surgery (FESS) presents with persistent nasal discharge and facial pain. During the follow-up, the surgeon considers various potential complications. Which of the following is not a common complication of FESS?",
      "options": {
        "A": "Orbital injury",
        "B": "Optic nerve injury",
        "C": "CSF leak",
        "D": "Fractured nasal bones"
      },
      "correct_answer": "D",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: D) Fractured nasal bones Explanation: Fractured nasal bones are not a common complication of Functional Endoscopic Sinus Surgery (FESS). Nasal bone fractures are more related to trauma or external injury than complications directly resulting from FESS. Functional Endoscopic Surgery of the Sinuses (FESS): Designed to restore proper drainage and ventilation of the sinuses using a rigid Endoscope, which provides superior illumination and magnification, improving precision. Preoperative Considerations: Preoperative Imaging: Evaluating the middle meatal area and identifying Onodi cells and critical structures like the optic nerve and internal carotid artery. Rule-out Conditions: Cribiform plate (Low-lying): Check the depth of the fossa (8-10 mm) Lamina papyracea: Assess for dehiscence or damage risks. Optic nerve: Evaluate proximity and risk of injury. Sphenoid sinus: Check for dehiscence of the lateral wall. Ethmoidal artery (Anterior): Risk of injury should be assessed. Surgical Techniques: Uncinectomy: This is an essential initial step in FESS to access the sinuses, and it should be performed carefully to avoid damage to the orbital and cranial structures. Removal of the Ethmoidal Bulla Posterior Ethmoidectomy Sphenoidotomy Frontal Sinus Surgery Complications of FESS: Hemorrhage It is often associated with injury to the anterior ethmoidal artery or excessive middle turbinate resection. Control bleeding with vasoconstrictors or bipolar diathermy; manage severe cases with topical hemostats or direct repair. Orbital Injury (Option A) First incision or during middle meatal antrostomy. Orbital Hematoma Associated with injury to the anterior ethmoidal artery Risk if orbital fat is exposed; requires immediate management. Optic Nerve Injury (Option B) Possible from intra-orbital hematoma or direct damage. CSF Leak (Option C) Risk around the vertical lamella of the cribriform plate. Immediate repair is usually effective, using fat plugs, artificial materials, or fibrin glue. Carotid Artery Injury It is rare but catastrophic, especially during sphenoid surgery. Immediate hemostatic resuscitation and sphenoid packing are essential; consider endovascular stenting as an alternative to direct repair. Post Surgery Complication Synechiae Formation: Prevented by nasal packing with Mitomycin C in the middle meatal area.",

      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: A) Non-Contrast CT Explanation: Non-Contrast CT of the Sinus is typically used as the initial imaging modality for diagnosing and evaluating chronic sinusitis . It helps in visualising the extent of mucosal thickening, sinus opacification, and anatomical abnormalities such as polyps and structural obstructions. Contrast-enhanced CT (Option B) Used when there is a need to assess for more complex cases or complications, such as the spread of infection to adjacent structures or suspected malignancy. It provides an enhanced visualisation of vascular structures. X-ray (Option C) provides limited detail with poor sensitivity and specificity, making it less effective in evaluating chronic sinusitis and generally not preferred compared to CT. HRCT (Option D) offers detailed imaging of the lungs and temporal bones, making it ideal for evaluating interstitial lung diseases like idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis and sarcoidosis, as well as detecting conditions such as cholesteatoma and otosclerosis in the temporal bone.",

      "explanation": "Correct Answer: A) Oral Amoxicillin with clavulanic acid Explanation: Antibiotics are a critical component of treatment for acute bacterial sinusitis, particularly when symptoms have persisted or worsened for more than 7-10 days. Amoxicillin with clavulanic acid is a first-line choice due to its broad-spectrum coverage and effectiveness against common pathogens causing bacterial sinusitis, including Streptococcus pneumoniae and Haemophilus influenzae. Management of Acute Sinusitis Management Aspect Description Indications Antibiotics First-line: Oral Amoxicillin with clavulanic acid Alternatives: Doxycycline, Levofloxacin Duration: Typically 7-14 days Persistent symptoms lasting >7-10 days. Intranasal Corticosteroids Fluticasone, Mometasone (Reduces mucosal inflammation and improves sinus drainage) Adjunctive therapy Significant mucosal swelling Concurrent allergic rhinitis Saline Irrigations Helps in thinning mucus and flushing bacteria. Symptomatic relief and improves mucus clearance. Topical Nasal Decongestants Oxymetazoline, Xylometazoline Provides symptomatic relief.
