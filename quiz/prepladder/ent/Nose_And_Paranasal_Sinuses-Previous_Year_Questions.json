      },
      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: A) Conductive hearing loss, ipsilateral temporoparietal neuralgia, palatal paralysis hearing loss : Due to obstruction of the Eustachian tube by the tumour, leading to middle ear effusion. Ipsilateral temporoparietal neuralgia : Caused by tumour infiltration into the base of the skull, affecting branches of the trigeminal nerve. Palatal paralysis : Resulting from involvement of the pharyngeal plexus or cranial nerves IX and X. Sensorineural hearing loss, contralateral temporoparietal neuralgia, palatal paralysis (Option B) : Sensorineural hearing loss is not typically seen in NPC unless there is advanced cranial nerve involvement. Neuralgia and paralysis are ipsilateral to the tumour, not contralateral. Sensorineural hearing loss, ipsilateral temporoparietal neuralgia, palatal paralysis (Option C) : As mentioned, hearing loss in NPC is usually conductive, not sensorineural. Conductive hearing loss, contralateral temporoparietal neuralgia, palatal paralysis (Option D) : While conductive hearing loss and palatal paralysis are consistent with NPC, the neuralgia is ipsilateral to the tumour, not contralateral.

      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer A - Roomy nasal cavity The patient's symptoms, nasal obstruction, anosmia (loss of smell), foul-smelling nasal discharge, and yellowish-green crusts , are highly suggestive of Atrophic Rhinitis . Atrophic Rhinitis is a chronic nasal condition characterized by: Progressive atrophy of the nasal mucosa and turbinates Formation of thick, foul-smelling nasal crusts Merciful anosmia (patients are unaware of the foul smell) Roomy nasal cavity due to atrophy of nasal structures Nasal polyps (Option B): Incorrect because nasal polyps present with bilateral nasal obstruction , watery rhinorrhea, and no foul smell . They are soft, pale, and non-crusting, unlike the yellowish-green crusts in Atrophic Rhinitis. Inferior turbinate hypertrophy (Option C): Incorrect because Atrophic Rhinitis causes atrophy of the turbinates, not hypertrophy. Hypertrophy occurs in allergic rhinitis or chronic rhinitis , which presents with congestion rather than a foul-smelling discharge. Foreign body (Option D): Incorrect because a foreign body in the nose is more common in children and typically causes unilateral foul-smelling nasal discharge , rather than bilateral atrophic changes seen in Atrophic Rhinitis.

        "D": "Anastomoses of 7 major arteries occur here"
      },
      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: A) Keisselbach’s plexus is present in the Little’s area Explanation: Little's area , also known as Kiesselbach's plexus , is a highly vascular region located in the anterior part of the nasal septum. It is a site of frequent epistaxis (nosebleeds) due to the rich network of blood vessels that anastomose here. Keisselbach's plexus is a network of arteries formed by anastomoses of branches from the internal carotid artery (like the sphenopalatine artery ) and the external carotid artery (including the superior labial artery and anterior ethmoidal artery ), which supply the nasal septum. Kiesselbach’s plexus, also known as Little's area , is a highly vascularised region in the anteroinferior portion of the nasal septum , where multiple arteries converge. It is the most common site of anterior epistaxis , especially in children and young adults. Vessels involved in forming the plexus Artery Branch of Sphenopalatine artery Maxillary artery Anterior ethmoidal artery Ophthalmic artery (from internal carotid artery) Greater palatine artery Maxillary artery Superior labial artery Facial artery (from external carotid artery) Note: Posterior ethmoidal artery is not part of this plexus Clinical Significance: Anterior epistaxis occurs most often in children and young adults, usually due to trauma (nose-picking), dry air, infections, or irritants. Epistaxis in this area is typically mild and self-limiting and can be controlled with local pressure or simple cauterization. It is situated at the posteroinferior part of the nasal septum (Option B) : is incorrect because Little's area is located at the anteroinferior part of the nasal septum, not the posterior. Least common site for epistaxis (Option C) : is incorrect because Little's area is the most common site for epistaxis, not the least. Anastomoses of 7 major arteries occur here (Option D) : is incorrect because the anastomoses of the major arteries involved in Little’s area are primarily derived from the internal and external carotid arteries, but not seven arteries. The arteries involved are generally 4-5, not seven.",

      "question": "What is the most likely diagnosis for a 14-year-old male who has been experiencing repeated nosebleeds, without any history of injury, along with nasal blockage and excessive nasal discharge? During examination, a solid, purplish growth is observed on the back of the nasopharynx.",
      "options": {
        "A": "Nasopharyngeal carcinoma",
        "B": "Rhabdomyosarcoma",
        "C": "Pyogenic granuloma",
        "D": "Juvenile nasopharyngeal angiofibroma"
      },
      "correct_answer": "D",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: D) Juvenile nasopharyngeal angiofibroma Explanation: Juvenile nasopharyngeal angiofibroma: This benign but locally aggressive vascular tumour occurs predominantly in adolescent males. It commonly presents with repeated episodes of epistaxis (nosebleeds) , nasal obstruction , and sometimes nasal discharge . Examination often reveals a solid, vascular, purplish mass in the nasopharynx. This is the most probable diagnosis in a 14-year-old male with these symptoms and findings. Juvenile nasopharyngeal angiofibroma (JNA) Site of Origin Posterior nasal cavity, near the superior margin of the sphenopalatine foramen, where the sphenoid and palatine bones meet. Gross Appearance Reddish-purple, lobulated, sessile mass covered by mucosa; lacks a capsule despite being benign. Microscopic Appearance Vascular Tissue: Endothelium-lined spaces with incomplete/absent muscle coats, leading to bleeding; peripheral vessels are thin-walled, central vessels hyperplastic. Stromal Cells: Stellate or spindle-shaped cells that produce collagen, affecting tumor firmness. Immunohistochemistry Fibroblasts, collagen, myofibroblasts, mast cells, and occasionally giant cells are present. Reactivity to smooth muscle actin and beta-catenin, suggesting beta-catenin’s role in growth. Growth Factors JNA development likely results from a combination of hormonal influence, growth factors, and genetic factors. Androgen Receptors: Present in 75% of JNA tumors, indicating male hormone involvement. VEGF: Promotes endothelial and stromal cell growth. IGF-II: Role is less clear. Genetics: C-MYC proto-oncogene found in larger tumors; may interact with androgen receptor and beta-catenin genes. Nasopharyngeal carcinoma (Option A): This malignant tumour usually occurs in older adults and is rare in this age group. It often presents with neck lymphadenopathy, nasal obstruction, or ear symptoms but is unlikely to present with a solid, vascular growth in a young male. Rhabdomyosarcoma (Option B): This is a malignant soft tissue tumour that can occur in the nasopharynx but is rare and less likely to cause repeated epistaxis without systemic signs like weight loss or fatigue. Pyogenic granuloma (Option C): This is a vascular lesion but typically occurs on the nasal septum or oral mucosa, not in the nasopharynx. It is usually smaller, friable, and more superficial.

      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: C) Oral cavity Explanation: In India, the oral cavity is the most common site for head and neck cancer. This high prevalence is largely attributed to the widespread use of tobacco in various forms (smoking, chewing, betel quid) and alcohol consumption. Poor oral hygiene and HPV infection are also contributory factors. Nasopharynx (Option A) : While nasopharyngeal carcinoma is relatively common in some regions (e.g., Southeast Asia), it is not the most common site of head and neck cancer in India. Oropharynx (Option B) : Oropharyngeal cancers, including those involving the tonsils and base of the tongue, are associated with HPV infection but are less common than oral cavity cancers in India. Hypopharynx (Option D) : Hypopharyngeal cancers are associated with smoking and alcohol use but are less frequent than oral cavity cancers in the Indian population.

      "question": "What should be the subsequent course of action in managing a patient who arrives at the emergency department with epistaxis, despite unsuccessful attempts to stop the bleeding by pinching the nostrils and nasal packing?",
      "options": {
        "A": "Ligation of external carotid artery",
        "B": "Ligation of internal carotid artery",
        "C": "Ligation of sphenopalatine artery",
        "D": "Ligation of maxillary artery"
      },
      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer C - Ligation of sphenopalatine artery Epistaxis (nosebleed) that persists despite pinching the nostrils and nasal packing suggests posterior epistaxis , which is often due to bleeding from the sphenopalatine artery . The sphenopalatine artery is the main arterial supply to the nasal cavity, making it the primary target for surgical intervention in refractory cases. Management Approach: Initial Management Pinching nostrils (first-line conservative treatment) Nasal packing (anterior and posterior) If Nasal Packing Fails Endoscopic ligation or cauterization of the sphenopalatine artery is the preferred next step. If Epistaxis Persists Ligation of the external carotid artery may be considered as a last resort. Ligation of external carotid artery (Option A): Incorrect because sphenopalatine artery ligation is more effective and less invasive . External carotid artery ligation is reserved for extreme, uncontrolled cases . Ligation of internal carotid artery (Option B): Incorrect because this is very high-risk , associated with stroke and severe complications , and is not required for managing epistaxis. Ligation of maxillary artery (Option D): Incorrect because while the maxillary artery supplies the sphenopalatine artery , directly ligating the sphenopalatine artery is more targeted and less morbid .

        "B": "Towne’s view",
        "C": "Law’s view",
        "D": "Stenver’s view"
      },
      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: A) Water’s view Explanation: Water's view (also known as the occipitomental view) is the radiographic projection that provides the best visualization of the maxillary sinus. This view is obtained by having the patient tilt their head back, with the chin raised and the X-ray beam directed at the patient’s face. It allows optimal imaging of the maxillary sinus, as it projects the sinus clearly and eliminates superimposition of other structures. View Position Purpose Image Waters' View (Occipitomental View) Chin-up position. Best view to visualize the maxillary sinus. Pierre’s View Similar to Waters' view but with the mouth open . Best view to visualize the sphenoid sinus. Caldwell View (Occipitofrontal View) Chin-down position. Best view to visualize the frontal sinus. Lateral View Lateral (as the name indicates) Allows visualization of all sinuses (frontal, maxillary, sphenoid, and ethmoidal). Helps to understand the pneumatization pattern of the sphenoid sinus. Incorrect Options: Towne’s view (Option B) : Towne's view is used primarily for imaging the skull, particularly the occipital region, and is not specifically for the maxillary sinus. Law’s view (Option C) : Law's view is used to assess the temporomandibular joint (TMJ) and not for the maxillary sinus. Stenver’s view (Option D) : Stenver’s view is used to image the petrous portion of the temporal bone and is not ideal for visualizing the maxillary sinus.",

        "D": "Rhinosporidiosis"
      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: B) Mucormycosis Explanation: The most likely diagnosis for an older diabetic woman with a malodorous black discharge from the nose, a necrotic black mass filling the nasal cavity, and erosion of the septum and hard palate is mucormycosis . This is a severe fungal infection caused by molds from the Mucoraceae family, often affecting immunocompromised individuals, such as those with diabetes, receiving steroids, and having viral infections like COVID-19. Mucormycosis commonly presents with: Nasal or sinus involvement (as seen with black, necrotic tissue and discharge). Erosion of surrounding structures, such as the septum and palate. A rapidly progressive course, especially in diabetic and immunocompromised patients. Malodorous discharge due to tissue necrosis. Mucormycosis Description A severe fungal infection primarily affects the nose and sinuses but can quickly spread to the orbit, cribriform plate, meninges, and brain. The fungus invades arteries, causing endothelial damage, thrombosis, and rapid tissue destruction. Characteristic Findings Black necrotic material in the nasal cavity, eroding the nasal septum, hard palate, and turbinates. Black turbinate sign is seen on contrast enhanced MRI. Risk Factors Uncontrolled diabetes, especially with ketoacidosis Prolonged steroid use (common in COVID-19 treatment) Conditions causing immunosuppression: Neutropenia, HIV/AIDS, chemotherapy, organ transplants, and kidney issues. Diagnosis Endoscopy: Shows pale mucosa early, progressing to black crusts and sloughing. Biopsy: Multiple sites should be sampled for fungal identification; potassium hydroxide preparation is the gold standard for confirming invasive features. Imaging CT : Detects bony destruction and initial assessment of sinus involvement. CECT: CECT provides better delineation of soft tissue structures, allowing for clearer identification of mucosal thickening, sinus opacification, and bony destruction. MRI : Evaluates soft tissue invasion, assesses the extent of extra-sinus disease, and identifies complications, especially in the orbit and brain . Treatment Antifungal Therapy : Amphotericin B: 0.6 to 1 mg/kg/day IV or liposomal Amphotericin B: 5 mg/kg/day. Posaconazole: 300 mg twice daily orally on the first day, then 300 mg once daily. Surgical Intervention : Endoscopic debridement of necrotic tissues. Severe cases: Total/Partial maxillectomy or orbital exenteration may be required. Incorrect Options: Aspergillosis (Option A) : Aspergillosis is another fungal infection, but it typically does not present with black necrotic masses. It is more commonly associated with chronic sinusitis or allergic reactions, not with necrosis and tissue destruction seen here. Foreign body (Option C) : A foreign body might cause a localized obstruction and discharge but would not lead to the extensive necrosis and erosion of the nasal cavity, septum, and palate as described in this case. Rhinosporidiosis (Option D) : Rhinosporidiosis is a chronic infection caused by Rhinosporidium seeberi , typically involving the nasal mucosa. It causes polypoidal growths, not necrotic black masses. It is more common in endemic areas, such as India and Sri Lanka.",

      "correct_answer": "D",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: D) Maxillary sinus Explanation: The maxillary sinus is the largest of the paranasal sinuses, located within the maxilla (upper jaw bone). It is pyramid-shaped and lies lateral to the nasal cavity, with its base forming the lateral wall of the nose and its apex extending towards the zygomatic bone. On radiographic or anatomical images, it appears as a large, air-filled cavity inferior to the orbit and lateral to the nasal cavity. Key features of the maxillary sinus: Largest paranasal sinus. Drains into the middle meatus of the nasal cavity through the semilunar hiatus. Commonly involved in sinusitis due to the high location of its drainage opening. The maxillary sinus or the Antrum of Highmore , is the largest of the paranasal sinuses, occupying the body of the maxilla. Shape - Pyramidal Size - 15mL Base - toward the lateral wall of the nose Apex - extends into the zygomatic process of the maxillary bone Relations: Anterior wall: Formed by the facial surface of the maxilla. Posterior wall: Anterior surface of pterygopalatine fossa. Medial wall: Thin and membranous in some areas, this wall borders the middle and inferior meatuses and separates the maxillary sinus from the nasal cavity. Roof: Formed by the floor of the orbit Floor: Located approximately 1 cm below the floor of the nasal cavity, it is formed by the alveolar and palatine processes of the maxilla. Closely related to the roots of the second premolar and first molar teeth. Cavities in these teeth are associated with oro antral fistula. Arterial supply: Branches of the maxillary artery, specifically the infraorbital artery, greater palatine artery, and the posterior superior alveolar artery. Venous drainage: Pterygoid venous plexus and the facial vein. Lymphatic drainage: Submandibular lymph nodes. Nerve supply: Infraorbital nerve, greater palatine nerve, and the posterior superior alveolar nerve, which are branches of the maxillary division of the trigeminal nerve (CN V2).

Septal hematomas occur due to trauma, such as a fall, and can result in blood collection between the cartilage and mucosa of the nasal septum. The treatment of choice for septal hematomas is incision and drainage . If left untreated, septal hematomas can lead to complications such as abscess formation, nasal deformities, or even septal perforation due to cartilage necrosis. Septal Hematoma Aetiology Collection of blood under the perichondrium or periosteum of the nasal septum. Commonly caused by: Nasal trauma. Septal surgery. Spontaneous occurrence in bleeding disorders. Clinical features Bilateral nasal obstruction (most common symptom). Frontal headache and pressure over the nasal bridge. Smooth, rounded, soft, and fluctuant swelling in both nasal fossae (or sometimes unilateral). Treatment Small hematomas: Aspirated with a wide-bore sterile needle. Larger hematomas: Incision and drainage via a septal incision parallel to the nasal floor, excising a small piece of mucosa for better drainage. Nasal packing on both sides to prevent reaccumulation. Systemic antibiotics to prevent septal abscess. Complications Fibrous tissue formation leads to permanent septal thickening if untreated. Secondary infection may lead to septal abscess, cartilage necrosis, and nasal dorsum depression. Incorrect Options: Systemic antibiotics (Option A) : While systemic antibiotics might be used if there is evidence of infection, antibiotics alone would not address the hematoma or swelling in this case. Drainage is necessary to prevent further complications. High-resolution computerized tomography (Option C) : CT imaging is typically not required for the diagnosis or management of a septal hematoma. A clinical examination is sufficient to make the diagnosis. CT may be considered if there is suspicion of fractures or other complex injuries, but it's not necessary in this straightforward case. Submucosal resection (Option D) : Submucosal resection is a procedure used in the treatment of nasal obstructions or deformities, often due to structural issues like a deviated septum. It is not appropriate for managing a septal hematoma, which requires drainage rather than resection.",

      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "with symptoms suggestive of recurrent or persistent rhinosinusitis despite previous functional endoscopic sinus surgery (FESS). The key finding is mucosal edema of the maxillary sinus lining with patent ostia. This suggests inflammation as the primary issue, not anatomical obstruction. Since the ostia are patent, drainage is not the problem, making further surgery less likely to be beneficial at this stage. Hence, it requires antihistamines and steroid irrigation. Steroid irrigation reduces mucosal edema and antihistamines help in controlling allergic symptoms and mucosal edema. Non-Allergic Rhinitis: Treatment Non-allergic rhinitis presents with symptoms similar to allergic rhinitis (nasal obstruction, rhinorrhoea, sneezing) but without positive allergy tests. Treatment is categorised into medical and surgical options. Medical Treatment: Treatment Type Details Lifestyle Modifications Avoid triggers such as sudden temperature changes, humidity, air blasts, and dust. Practical changes to minimise symptom triggers Pharmacological Management Antihistamines and Decongestants: Alleviate nasal obstruction, sneezing, and rhinorrhoea. Topical Steroid Sprays: Control Symptoms. Eg. Beclomethasone dipropionate, budesonide, fluticasone Systemic Steroids: Used for severe cases for a short time Ipratropium Bromide Nasal Spray: Effective for Excessive Rhinorrhoea. Psychological Support Address emotional factors; consider counselling and tranquillisers. Repeat surgery (Option A): Repeat surgery is not indicated in this scenario as it could be initially conservatively managed with steroid irrigation and antihistamines. Later, if the symptoms persist, surgical management can be considered . Macrolides for 4 months (Option B): It is prescribed in case of chronic rhinosinusitis. Biological therapy (Option D): Biological therapy is indicated only in severe refractory cases which show symptoms of active inflammation Reference: Diseases of Ear, Nose, Throat - PL Dhingra, 8th edition, Pg 178,198, 223",

      "explanation": "respiratory tract involvement (saddle nose, septal perforation), lower respiratory tract involvement (cough, hemoptysis, cavitary lesions), and the biopsy findings (granulomas, multinucleated giant cells, and necrosis) strongly points towards Wegener's granulomatosis (Granulomatosis with Polyangiitis). Granulomatosis with polyangiitis: Previously known as Wegener’s granulomatosis. It is a systemic granulomatous inflammation and necrotizing vasculitis affecting small- to medium-sized vessels. More common in Caucasians (90%). Clinical features: Upper respiratory tract symptoms: Clear or purulent bloody nasal discharge Sinusitis On examination, crusting, granulations, septal perforation, and a saddle nose. Lower respiratory tract symptoms: cough, pleuritic pain, and hemoptysis. kidneys: Hematuria, later renal failure. Oral: ‘strawberry’ gingival hyperplasia is said to be pathognomonic. Skin: ulceration and nodules. Diagnosis: Chest X-ray: Nodules, fixed infiltrates or cavities Urine analysis: Microscopic haematuria with or without red cell casts. Biopsy: Necrosis and ulceration of mucosa, epithelioid granuloma, and necrotizing vasculitis involving small arteries or veins. c-ANCA (cytoplasmic ANCA): Positive in 90% of the cases. p-ANCA (perinuclear ANCA): Positive in 10% of the cases. CT and MRI: Non-specific mucosal thickening in the nasal cavity or paranasal sinuses, bone destruction, and new bone formation in the walls of the sinus cavities. Treatment: Systemic corticosteroids. Cyclophosphamide, azathioprine, methotrexate and rituximab are used. Tuberculosis (Option B): While TB can cause granulomas, the combination of nasal destruction (septal perforation, saddle nose) with lung cavities is more characteristic of GPA. TB can present with hemoptysis, but it's less commonly associated with the rapid destruction of nasal cartilage leading to saddle nose deformity as seen in GPA. Syphilis (Option C): Congenital syphilis can cause a saddle nose deformity. However, the other symptoms described (cough, hemoptysis, cavitary lung lesions, and the specific biopsy findings) are not typical of syphilis. Also, lung involvement is not a common presentation of syphilis. Sarcoidosis (Option D): Sarcoidosis is a multisystem granulomatous disease that can affect the lungs and upper respiratory tract. While it can cause granulomas on biopsy and lung involvement, it's less likely to cause destructive nasal changes like saddle nose deformity and septal perforation.

Saccharine test (Option A): This test helps in assessing nasal mucociliary clearance. Saccharin is placed around 1 cm behind the anterior end of the inferior turbinate. The saccharin is swept back into the nasopharynx and perceived as a sweet taste. This suggests an intact/good mucociliary clearance. If the patient perceives the taste after 10-20 minutes, it indicates a delayed mucociliary clearance. Charcoal powder method (Option C): This helps in assessing nasal mucociliary clearance. In this test, 10 micrograms of charcoal are kept 1 cm behind the head of the inferior turbinate. The patient is asked to inhale the charcoal particles. It is seen deposited over the respiratory epithelium. Every 30 seconds, the posterior pharyngeal wall is observed for a blackish discoloration. After 30 minutes to 1 hour, the patient is asked to expectorate. The sputum is then examined for charcoal particles.

        "C": "Syphilis",
        "D": "Tuberculosis"
      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: B) Seasonal influenza Explanation: Seasonal influenza is the least likely cause of nasal septal perforation. While influenza can lead to symptoms like nasal congestion, sore throat, and fever, it typically does not result in nasal septal perforation. This condition is more often associated with chronic inflammation, infection, or trauma to the nasal septum, such as in cases of rhinosporidiosis, syphilis, or tuberculosis. Causes of Nasal Septal Perforation : Nasal septal perforation is a hole or rupture in the nasal septum, the cartilage and bone that divides the two nostrils. Several conditions can lead to this, including: Rhinosporidiosis : This is a chronic granulomatous infection caused by the fungus Rhinosporidium seeberi , often affecting the nasal mucosa and leading to the development of polyps or perforations in the nasal septum. Syphilis : A sexually transmitted infection caused by Treponema pallidum , syphilis can cause granulomatous inflammation, particularly in the tertiary stage, leading to nasal septal perforation (a manifestation of gumma). Tuberculosis : This chronic bacterial infection caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis can result in chronic granulomatous inflammation, leading to nasal septal perforation as part of the disease process, especially in advanced cases. Seasonal influenza (Option B) : is incorrect because while it causes acute viral upper respiratory tract infections, it does not typically result in chronic inflammation or tissue destruction that would lead to septal perforation. Incorrect Options: Rhinosporidiosis (Option A) : is incorrect because this fungal infection is a well-known cause of nasal septal perforation due to chronic inflammation and polyp formation. Syphilis (Option C) : is incorrect because tertiary syphilis can cause granulomatous lesions, including perforation of the nasal septum. Tuberculosis (Option D) : is incorrect because tuberculosis, particularly in its chronic form, can cause nasal septal perforation due to granulomatous inflammation.

      "explanation": "Correct Answer C- Cottle’s test. Explanation: Cottle’s Test is a diagnostic maneuver used to evaluate nasal obstruction, particularly to assess the patency of the nasal passages and nasal valve function . During this test, the examiner applies external pressure to the lateral nasal walls (just below the cheekbone) to temporarily relieve nasal obstruction. If this improves the patient’s airflow, it suggests nasal valve collapse or dysfunction, which is often seen in patients with deviated septum or nasal valve stenosis . Cottle’s Test: Cottle's test involves applying pressure to the lateral nasal wall while the patient is instructed to breathe in. If improvement in nasal airflow is noted when external pressure is applied, it indicates that nasal valve collapse is the cause of the obstruction. This test is frequently used before performing surgical interventions , such as septoplasty or rhinoplasty , to confirm the diagnosis of nasal valve insufficiency . Incorrect Options: Epley’s maneuver (Option A) : is incorrect because it is used for benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV) , not for nasal or facial assessments. Heimlich maneuver (Option B) : is incorrect because it is used for airway obstruction due to choking, not for assessing nasal function. Trotter’s method (Option D) : is incorrect because it is a clinical sign of nasopharyngeal carcinoma , characterized by trismus and nasal obstruction but not a diagnostic maneuver like Cottle's test.",

      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer A- Rhinophyma Explanation: Rhinophyma is a severe form of acne rosacea and is characterized by the thickening and enlargement of the nasal skin, often with a bulbous appearance. It is more common in men and typically develops in individuals with a long history of rosacea. The condition causes facial deformity due to the increased sebaceous gland activity and inflammation. The nose becomes enlarged and may appear red and nodular, which is consistent with the image shown. Rhinophyma: Rhinophyma is a subtype of acne rosacea , often associated with long-term rosacea that leads to the hypertrophy of the sebaceous glands on the nose. This condition manifests as: Thickening of the skin , leading to a bulbous or enlarged nose. Redness or telangiectasias (visible blood vessels) on the nose. It typically affects middle-aged to older men and is often triggered or worsened by chronic inflammation from acne rosacea. Treatment may involve laser therapy , surgical excision , or topical treatments to reduce the size and appearance of the nose. Incorrect Options: Rhinoscleroma (Option B) : is incorrect because rhinoscleroma is a chronic bacterial infection (caused by Klebsiella pneumoniae ) that leads to granulomatous inflammation and fibrosis, affecting the nasal and upper respiratory tract. It does not present with the same cosmetic deformity seen in rhinophyma. Rhinosporidiosis (Option C) : is incorrect because rhinosporidiosis is a chronic infection caused by the Rhinosporidium seeberi , which leads to the development of polyps, not the thickening and deformity of the nose characteristic of rhinophyma. Scleroderma (Option D): is incorrect because scleroderma primarily causes skin tightening and fibrosis but does not lead to the characteristic redness and bulbous deformity of the nose seen in rhinophyma.

      },
      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer C- Nasopharyngeal carcinoma Explanation: Nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) commonly presents with cervical lymphadenopathy, which can explain the neck nodes observed in this patient. The patient also exhibits a dull tympanic membrane, which can be associated with eustachian tube dysfunction , a common manifestation in NPC due to obstruction or invasion of the nasopharynx. This dysfunction leads to middle ear effusion and the type B tympanogram seen in this case. The presence of deafness and tinnitus further suggests that the nasopharyngeal carcinoma may be affecting the middle ear or the auditory pathway. Nasopharyngeal Carcinoma (NPC): Nasopharyngeal carcinoma is a malignant tumor arising from the epithelial cells of the nasopharynx. It is more common in certain geographic regions and in older individuals. The disease often presents with: Cervical lymphadenopathy (neck nodes), as seen in this patient. Deafness or tinnitus , due to eustachian tube obstruction , which leads to middle ear effusion, presenting with a dull tympanic membrane. Type B tympanogram , which indicates middle ear effusion or obstruction. Incorrect Options: Chronic suppurative otitis media (Option A) : is incorrect because this condition typically causes a purulent discharge and would not lead to the characteristic lymphadenopathy or dull tympanic membrane associated with NPC. Glomus tumor (Option B) : is incorrect because although it can cause tinnitus and middle ear effusion, it would not typically present with cervical lymphadenopathy or the eustachian tube dysfunction leading to type B tympanogram. Sensorineural hearing loss (Option D): is incorrect because while it can cause hearing loss, the additional findings of cervical lymphadenopathy, a dull tympanic membrane, and type B tympanogram point toward a more localized pathology, such as NPC.

While their development begins earlier, they do not appear clearly on radiographs until this age, as the sinuses are still small and continue to grow throughout childhood. Development of Paranasal Sinuses: Maxillary Sinus : The maxillary sinus is the first to develop and is present at birth as a small cavity. It grows rapidly during the early years of life and reaches full size by 4 years of age . Ethmoid Sinus : The ethmoid sinus is present as a small cluster of cells at birth and becomes more prominent in childhood. Development continues up to 6-8 years , with further changes through adolescence. Sphenoid Sinus : The sphenoid sinus begins to develop around 2 years of age. It is typically visible on imaging after 3-5 years and reaches its adult size by 12 years . Frontal Sinus : The frontal sinuses are not visible on imaging until about 4 years of age , with full development occurring much later, generally by the age of 16-18 years .

It occurs when there is impaired airflow through the nasal cavity during speech, resulting in a distinctive \"blocked\" or muffled sound. This condition is typically caused by nasal obstruction or nasopharyngeal pathology . Rhinolalia Clausa : Nasopharyngeal polyp , nasopharyngeal carcinoma (Option B) , and nasopharyngeal angiofibroma are all conditions that can obstruct the nasopharyngeal region , leading to nasal speech (rhinolalia clausa).

        "C": "After 2 weeks of injury",
        "D": "After 4 weeks of injury"
      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer B- 5-7 days following injury Explanation: In the case of a nasal fracture , the ideal time for closed reduction is typically within 5-7 days following the injury. This time frame allows for the initial swelling to subside , providing better visibility and ensuring that the fractured bones can be accurately realigned. Reducing the fracture within this window also minimizes the risk of complications and ensures better cosmetic and functional outcomes. Timing of Nasal Fracture Reduction : Early reduction (within the first 12 hours ) may sometimes be appropriate for fractures with significant deformity or in cases where swelling is minimal. However, it's generally not advisable to reduce the fracture within the first few hours because the swelling can obscure proper alignment and make it harder to achieve a precise reduction. After 5-7 days , when swelling decreases, a closed reduction can be safely performed, and the nasal bones can be realigned without much obstruction from edema. If the reduction is done too late (e.g., after 2 weeks or more), bony consolidation begins, making the bones harder to manipulate, and the chances of achieving an optimal result decrease. Incorrect Options: Within 12 hours following the injury (Option A) : is incorrect because early reduction is often difficult due to swelling that can hinder the realignment of the nasal bones. After 2 weeks of injury (Option C) : is incorrect because waiting too long increases the risk of bony consolidation , making it harder to reduce the fracture and improving the chances of a less satisfactory result. After 4 weeks of injury (Option D) : is incorrect for the same reason. At this point, the bones may have healed or begun to heal, which would reduce the success rate of reduction.

      },
      "correct_answer": "D",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer D- Closed reduction and swelling will decrease automatically Explanation: In the case of a nasal fracture with no involvement of the septum , the most appropriate approach is to wait for the swelling to subside before proceeding with closed reduction . This period typically lasts around 10-14 days after the trauma, which allows for the edema (swelling) to decrease. After the swelling is reduced, closed reduction can be performed to realign the nasal bones without the risk of additional trauma or incorrect positioning. The reason for this approach is that if the closed reduction is performed too early, the swelling can obstruct proper visualization and alignment of the fractured nasal bones, potentially leading to complications or an incomplete reduction. Nasal Fracture Management : Closed reduction is the preferred management for nasal fractures that involve only the nasal bones, not the septum. Waiting for swelling to decrease naturally allows for better visualization during the procedure, reducing the chances of complications or inadequate realignment. Septo-rhinoplasty is typically only necessary for more complex fractures or when there is significant septal involvement that cannot be corrected with closed reduction. Open reduction is used for more complicated fractures where closed reduction isn't feasible. Incorrect Options: Septo-rhinoplasty (Option A) : is incorrect because it's a more invasive procedure used when there are issues with both the nasal bones and septum. Open reduction (Option B) : is incorrect because open reduction is generally only indicated in cases where closed reduction is not successful or in more complicated fractures. Closed reduction after edema subsides in 20 days (Option C) : is also incorrect because waiting for 20 days is unnecessary. The typical waiting period for swelling to subside is about",

        "D": "Sphenoethmoidal recess"
      },
      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: C) Middle meatus Explanation: The most common location for an obstruction caused by a nasal polyp originating from the maxillary sinus is the middle meatus . Nasal polyps are benign growths that arise from the mucosa of the nasal cavity or paranasal sinuses. When a polyp forms in the maxillary sinus, it typically expands into the middle meatus, which is the drainage pathway of the maxillary sinus. This can lead to obstruction, sinusitis, or blockage of the sinus drainage. Nasal Polyps : Nasal polyps are non-cancerous growths that develop in the nasal passages or sinuses due to chronic inflammation. They are frequently associated with conditions like chronic rhinosinusitis, asthma, and allergies. The most common location for these polyps is the middle meatus , which is where the maxillary sinuses drain. If the polyps obstruct the drainage system, it can lead to recurrent sinus infections, nasal congestion, and difficulty breathing through the nose. Incorrect Options: Inferior meatus (Option A) : is incorrect because the inferior meatus primarily drains the nasolacrimal duct and not the maxillary sinus, so polyps from the maxillary sinus would not typically obstruct this area. Superior meatus (Option B) : is incorrect because the superior meatus drains the posterior ethmoidal sinuses, not the maxillary sinus, so it would not be the most common site of obstruction for a maxillary sinus polyp. Sphenoethmoidal recess (Option D) : is incorrect because the sphenoethmoidal recess is the drainage site for the sphenoid sinus, not the maxillary sinus, making it an unlikely location for obstruction due to a maxillary sinus polyp.

        "C": "Antral lavage",
        "D": "CT scan"
      },
      "correct_answer": "D",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: D) CT scan Explanation: The preferred diagnostic procedure prior to performing Functional Endoscopic Sinus Surgery (FESS) is a CT scan . A CT scan provides detailed imaging of the sinus anatomy and helps to identify any sinus pathology such as sinusitis , nasal polyps , blockages , or anatomical variations that could affect the surgical approach. It is crucial for planning the procedure and avoiding complications during surgery. Functional Endoscopic Sinus Surgery (FESS): FESS is a minimally invasive surgical procedure used to treat chronic sinusitis, nasal polyps, and other sinus conditions. Before performing this surgery, it is essential to have a clear understanding of the patient's sinus anatomy and any underlying pathology. CT imaging is the gold standard for evaluating the sinuses, as it provides high-resolution, cross-sectional images that allow for precise assessment of sinus structures, mucosal involvement, and any blockages. Incorrect Options: MRI scan (Option A): is incorrect because MRI is typically used for evaluating soft tissue or neurological issues, and it is not as effective as CT for assessing the sinus anatomy and bone structures, which are key for FESS planning. X-ray (Option B): is incorrect because X-ray imaging is less detailed than CT and cannot provide the necessary clarity to evaluate the sinuses thoroughly, especially for complex sinus conditions. Antral lavage (Option C): is incorrect because antral lavage is a diagnostic and therapeutic procedure used to irrigate the maxillary sinus in cases of chronic sinusitis. However, it is not used for detailed preoperative planning for FESS. A CT scan is the more accurate and comprehensive diagnostic tool for this purpose.

        "D": "Allergic rhinitis"
      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: B) Atrophic rhinitis Explanation: Atrophic rhinitis: Surgery is sometimes performed in atrophic rhinitis to partially or completely occlude one nostril. In this condition, the nasal mucosa becomes thin and atrophic, leading to dry, crusting nasal passages and an impaired mucociliary clearance. Surgical interventions, such as septal surgery or turbinate reduction, may be necessary to manage the symptoms and help prevent further damage to the nasal structures. Atrophic Rhinitis: Atrophic rhinitis is a chronic condition characterized by the thinning and atrophy of the nasal mucosa and turbinate bones. It results in symptoms like dry nasal passages, crusting, foul-smelling nasal discharge, and in some cases, nasal obstruction. In advanced cases, surgical procedures may be done to improve nasal patency or to occlude the nostril to reduce airflow and symptoms. This procedure aims to decrease the discomfort caused by excessive dryness or other symptoms. Vasomotor rhinitis (Option A): is incorrect because vasomotor rhinitis involves nasal congestion triggered by environmental factors, but it does not require surgery to occlude the nostril. Invasive aspergillosis (Option C): is incorrect because invasive aspergillosis is a fungal infection that affects the sinuses and can cause symptoms like nasal obstruction and discharge, but surgery is not typically done to occlude a nostril in this case. Allergic rhinitis (Option D): is incorrect because allergic rhinitis is caused by immune reactions to allergens and is primarily managed with medications like antihistamines or intranasal steroids, not surgery to occlude a nostril.

      "explanation": "Correct Answer A - Water’s view Water’s view: In this radiographic projection, the X-ray beam is angled at approximately 45° to the orbitomeatal line. It is primarily used to visualize the paranasal sinuses, particularly the maxillary sinus, and the facial bones. The patient's head is positioned with the chin raised, and the X-ray beam is directed downward at this 45° angle to obtain clear images of the sinuses and the nasal cavity. Topic sinuses, frontal sinuses, and the nasal cavity. The 45° angulation helps project the sinuses clearly, avoiding superimposition of the surrounding bone structures. This view is often used in diagnosing sinusitis and other sinus-related conditions. Towne’s view (Option B): is incorrect because Towne's view involves a different angulation, typically 30° to the orbitomeatal line, used for visualizing the occipital bone and posterior cranial fossa. Law’s view (Option C): is incorrect because Law’s view is used for temporomandibular joint (TMJ) imaging, where the X-ray beam is angled at 15° to the horizontal plane. Stenver’s view (Option D): is incorrect because Stenver’s view is used for imaging the temporal bone and inner ear, with the X-ray beam directed laterally at an angle to the skull.

Therefore, it is not a division of the external carotid artery and does not contribute to Kiesselbach's plexus . Kiesselbach’s Plexus: Kiesselbach's plexus is a vascular network located on the anterior part of the nasal septum , composed of arteries from the external carotid artery . The common arteries involved in Kiesselbach's plexus include: Sphenopalatine artery (from the maxillary artery) Greater palatine artery (from the maxillary artery) Septal branch of the superior labial artery (from the facial artery) These vessels contribute to the blood supply to the nasal septum and are involved in conditions such as epistaxis (nosebleeds) . Incorrect Options: Sphenopalatine artery (Option B): is incorrect because the sphenopalatine artery is a branch of the maxillary artery , a branch of the external carotid, and it contributes to Kiesselbach's plexus.

During endoscopic examination of the right nasal cavity, the inferior turbinate is typically the most prominent structure visible. It plays an important role in conditioning the air we breathe by warming, moistening, and filtering it before it enters the respiratory tract. Inferior Turbinate: The inferior turbinate is composed of bone and covered with mucosa. Its main function is to regulate airflow and humidify the air that enters the nasal passages. It is most commonly involved in conditions like nasal obstruction or rhinitis and may become enlarged due to various inflammatory conditions. Incorrect Options: Middle turbinate (Option B): is incorrect because the middle turbinate is positioned above the inferior turbinate and is typically smaller in size. It is located in the middle meatus and can be visible in endoscopic examinations, but it's not the structure being referred to here.

Diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) – the most significant metabolic risk factor. Immunosuppression : High-dose steroids (e.g., in COVID-19 or autoimmune conditions). (Option D) Organ transplantation (e.g., liver, kidney) and immunosuppressive medications: Azathioprine, mycophenolate mofetil, tacrolimus, cyclosporine . HIV/AIDS – advanced disease with low CD4 count. Neutropenia : (Option A) Absolute neutrophil count (ANC) < 1500 . Common in cancer patients undergoing chemotherapy. Iron Overload : Use of Deferoxamine or other iron-chelating agents. Mechanical Ventilation : Prolonged mechanical ventilation increases the risk of fungal infections. Autoimmune Disorders : Diseases requiring immunosuppressive therapy. Other Causes : Malnutrition. Trauma or burns. Prolonged antibiotic use (disrupts normal flora).

Samter's Triad includes asthma, sinusitis with recurrent nasal polyps, and sensitivity to aspirin and other NSAIDs. Aspirin-Exacerbated Respiratory Disease (AERD) : also known as Samter's Triad, is a chronic medical condition characterized by the triad of asthma, chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps, and hypersensitivity reactions to aspirin and other(NSAIDs). Symptoms: The symptoms of AERD can vary in severity and may include: Recurrent episodes of asthma Chronic rhinosinusitis Nasal polyps, which are small growths in the lining of the nose that can obstruct the airway and cause breathing difficulties Hypersensitivity reactions to aspirin and other NSAIDs, which can cause severe respiratory symptoms, hives, swelling, and even anaphylaxis. Eosinophilia (Option A): Eosinophilia is a feature of allergic conditions but is not significantly associated with AERD. Extrinsic asthma (Option C): In Aspirin-Exacerbated Respiratory Disease (AERD), the asthma component is considered a type of non-allergic or intrinsic asthma rather than extrinsic asthma. Drug interaction (Option D): NSAIDs can worsen asthma symptoms in patients with the condition, but there is no drug-drug interaction causing AERD.

      "explanation": "Correct Answer: C) Benign and invasive Explanation: Inverted papilloma is the most common benign tumor of the nasal cavity. Although it is a benign tumor, it is locally invasive. It has a high rate of recurrence. The tumor grows inward from the lining of the nose and sinuses and can invade the underlying bone and surrounding structures, hence the term \"inverted.\" Inverted papilloma: is a benign tumor arising from the nasal epithelium, often associated with the paranasal sinuses, particularly the maxillary sinus. It typically presents in older adults and is more common in males. Risk Factors: The history of smoking is a notable risk factor for the development of inverted papilloma Clinical Presentation: The patient presents with nasal obstruction, epistaxis, and a sensation of pressure, which are common symptoms associated with inverted papilloma. Examination : The presence of a fleshy, lobulated mass on the lateral wall of the nasal cavity is characteristic of inverted papilloma. Histopathology: Invagination of the superficial epithelium into the underlying stroma. The epithelium may be of the keratinized squamous, respiratory or transitional types which may coexist in varying proportions.",

        "D": "Nasal polyp"
      },
      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: C) Hypertrophic rhinitis Explanation: Hypertrophic rhinitis is a chronic condition characterized by inflammation and thickening of the nasal mucosa, often due to prolonged irritation (e.g., allergies, infection, or pollutants). The mulberry appearance of the inferior turbinate is a hallmark of hypertrophic rhinitis, caused by nodular swellings on the turbinates. Symptoms like headache and thick nasal discharge are common due to nasal obstruction and secondary infections. Hypertrophic Rhinitis Cause : Progression from untreated chronic simple rhinitis, leading to repeated infections and submucosal fibrosis , causing turbinate hypertrophy. Commonly Affected Turbinate : Inferior turbinate – develops a mulberry appearance . Primary Symptom : Nasal obstruction (due to fibrosis). Management : Nasal obstruction due to fibrosis requires turbinate size reduction via partial or total turbinectomy. Turbinectomy (partial or total): To reduce the size of hypertrophied turbinates. Methods include: Laser surgery. Cryosurgery. Diathermy. Radiofrequency ablation. Surgical submucous resection of turbinate. Atrophic rhinitis (Option A): is a condition in which the nasal mucosa thins and dries out, leading to foul-smelling nasal discharge, crusting, and obstruction. The symptoms are not consistent with those seen in the patient. Common cold (Option B): Is a viral infection that affects the upper respiratory tract. It typically presents with symptoms such as cough, runny nose, and sore throat. Nasal polyp (Option D): are benign growths that arise from the lining of the nose or sinuses. They can lead to symptoms such as nasal obstruction, postnasal drip, and reduced sense of smell. While they may cause nasal discharge, the mulberry appearance of the inferior turbinate is not a feature of nasal polyps.

      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: B) Mucormycosis Explanation: The image, coupled with the clinical context of an elderly diabetic female, strongly suggests Mucormycosis as the most probable diagnosis. The image shows black necrotic tissue near the orbit, which is characteristic of rhino-orbital-cerebral mucormycosis . Mucormycosis It is an invasive disease caused by zygomycetes (phycomycetes) - Rhizopus, Mucor and Absidia. Rhizopus Arrhizus is the most common pathogen Rhizopus Absidia Mucor (Lactophenol cotton blue stained) Pathogenesis Begins in the respiratory tract or nasal cavity, where spores germinate and form mycelia → invade adjacent tissues, leading to local destruction. Fungi invade blood vessels, causing thrombosis and infarction in affected areas, which contributes to its high mortality rate (Angio-invasiveness) Common Sites Rhinocerebral Form : Involves the nose, nasal sinuses, and orbit; frequently seen in diabetic patients. Pulmonary Infections : When the lungs are the primary site, the fungi can invade lung arteries, leading to serious complications. Others: Cutaneous mucormycosis, GI mucormycosis, Disseminated mucormycosis Clinical Features Rhinocerebral Zygomycosis : Facial swelling, nasal discharge (often black ), fever, and mucosal necrosis . Rapid progression can lead to severe complications, including visual loss and neurological symptoms. Pulmonary Zygomycosis : Symptoms may include cough, fever, and hemoptysis Diagnosis Histological Examination : Diagnosis is confirmed by identifying broad, non-septate (or sparsely septate) hyphae. Culture: After incubation for 3-4 days on Sabouraud agar at 30-37°C, the colonies are grey-white with a thick cottony, fluffy surface. Under the microscope, nonseptate, broad",

Symptoms of a frontal mucocele include: Proptosis (bulging) of the eye Headache or facial pain Vision changes or double vision Nasal congestion or discharge Sinus pressure or pain Swelling or tenderness in the forehead Incorrect Options: Frontal meningioma (Option B): A meningioma is a tumor that arises from the lining of the brain or spinal cord. When a meningioma forms in the front of the head, it can cause eye proptosis. However, meningiomas are relatively uncommon in young adults, and a history of trauma may not be associated with developing a meningioma. Juvenile nasopharyngeal angiofibroma (Option C): Juvenile nasopharyngeal angiofibroma is a rare and benign tumor, typically in adolescent males. It arises from the back of the nose or upper throat and can cause eye proptosis as it grows. However, the history of trauma 15 years prior is not usually associated with developing a juvenile",

However, it is usually not associated with an irregular mass protruding from the choanae. It might cause nasal symptoms, but it's less likely to present with the specific characteristics described in the scenario. Option C - Hypertrophic Rhinitis: Hypertrophic rhinitis refers to the enlargement of the nasal turbinates due to chronic inflammation. While it can lead to nasal obstruction, it doesn't usually manifest as an irregular mass protruding from the choanae. It's more associated with internal nasal structures rather than external protrusions. Option D - Adenoid Hypertrophy: Adenoid hypertrophy involves the enlargement of the adenoid tissue, which is in the back of the nasal cavity, near the choanae. However, adenoids don't typically present as an irregular mass protruding through the choanae. Instead, they might cause more generalized nasal obstruction and related symptoms.",

EBV has a significant role in the development of nasopharyngeal carcinoma, as confirmed by the virus's consistent presence in tumor cells worldwide where NPC occurs. Patients affected by NPC exhibit consistently elevated antibody titers to viral capsid antigens, which indicates recent or active EBV infection. The clonal structure of the viral genome within individual tumors suggests that EBV infection occurred before tumor development, implicating the virus in the pathogenesis of NPC. However, despite the universal presence of EBV in NPC cases worldwide, the tumor's restricted geographic distribution suggests that genetic or environmental cofactors also contribute to its development Incorrect Options: Option A - Juvenile nasopharyngeal angiofibroma: Juvenile nasopharyngeal angiofibroma is a benign tumor that primarily affects adolescent males. It arises from the vascular tissues in the back of the nasal cavity and nasopharynx. However, it is not caused by the Epstein-Barr Virus (EBV). The exact cause of juvenile nasopharyngeal angiofibroma is unknown, but hormonal and genetic factors are believed to play a role.

      "question": "The frontal sinus can be viewed by taking an X-ray at a specific angle, which is depicted in the image below. What is the name of the view depicted?",
      "options": {
        "A": "Caldwell’s view",
        "B": "Towne’s view",
        "C": "Law’s view",
        "D": "Stenvers view"

      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "X-ray beam passing from behind the head at an angle of 15° to the radiographic plate. This description aligns with Caldwell's view, which is primarily used for assessing the frontal and ethmoidal sinuses as well as the nasal septum. Incorrect Options: Option B - Towne’s view: In this view X-ray beam is passed from above in front at an angle of 30° to the radiographic plate. It is mainly used to visualize the petrous part of the temporal bone and the posterior part of sella turcica. It is used to assess any fracture to the floor of the cranium, acoustic neuroma, and apical petrositis Option C - Law’s view: It is a lateral oblique view of the mastoid. The patient lies in such a way that the sagittal plane of the skull is parallel to the film, and the X-ray beam is projected 15°cephalocaudal. Structures seen are (a) External auditory canal superimposed on the internal auditory canal. (b) Mastoid air cells. (c) Tegmen. (d) Lateral sinus plate. (e) Temporomandibular joint. “Key area” of the mastoid, i.e., attic, aditus, and antrum, is not well seen. Option D - Stenver’s view: This view is taken in such a way that the long axis of the petrous bone lies parallel to the film. Structures seen are: (a) Entire petrous pyramid. (b) Arcuate eminence. (c) Internal auditory meatus. (d) Labyrinth with its vestibule. (e) Cochlea. (f) Mastoid antrum",

      "question": "An elderly diabetic female patient presented with a black, foul-smelling discharge from the nose. On examination, a blackish necrotic mass has filled the nasal cavity and eroded the septum and hard palate. What is the most probable diagnosis?",
      "options": {
        "A": "Aspergillosis",
        "B": "Mucormycosis",
        "C": "Foreign body",
        "D": "Rhinosporidiosis"
      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "nasal discharge, a black necrotic mass filling the nasal cavity, eroding the septum, and a hard palate is most likely suffering from mucormycosis. A class of molds known as mucormycetes is the source of mucormycosis. Mucormycosis is rapid growing disease involving the arteries and causing endothelial damage and thrombosis. Immunocompromised people are more likely to develop mucormycosis, such as those with uncontrolled diabetes. Incorrect Options: Option A - Aspergillosis: Aspergillus species can produce similar symptoms. Rather than black necrotic mass fungal ball containing cheesy-white or blackish material is usually observed. Option C - Foreign body: Neither a black necrotic mass nor a foul-smelling discharge would be caused by a foreign body. Option D - Rhinosporidiosis: Rhinosporidiosis is a very uncommon chronic illness brought on by Rhinosporidium seeberi, and it usually manifests as a painless, slowly expanding nasal polyp, which is inconsistent with the symptoms that are being reported.

Palatal paralysis (10 nerve involvement) It is diagnostic of nasopharyngeal carcinoma Incorrect Options: Option B - Adenoid cystic cancer: Typically, adenoid cystic cancer develops in the salivary glands without showing any symptoms like conductive hearing loss or restricted soft palate movement. Option C - Juvenile nasopharyngeal angiofibroma: Adolescent males are typically affected by juvenile nasopharyngeal angiofibroma, a rare non-cancerous tumor that seldom results in symptoms like conductive hearing loss or restricted soft palate mobility. Option D - Quinsy: Quinsy, also known as peritonsillar abscess, is a complication of tonsillitis that results in a severe sore throat, fever, and trouble swallowing but does not frequently cause symptoms like conductive hearing loss or constrained soft palate movement.

In immunocompetent, it primarily causes pulmonary infections and skin lesions, and in immunocompromised, it causes CNS infections. Option C - Candidiasis : It mainly causes opportunistic infections, with diabetes mellitus being the most common predisposing factor. It is often implicated in cutaneous, mucosal, intestinal, bronchopulmonary, and systemic infections. Option D - Histoplasmosis: Histoplasma capsulatum is a species of fungus that causes histoplasmosis. It is primarily a pulmonary infection but can also cause cutaneous and disseminated disease. It can cause infection in both immunocompetent and compromised patients. Histoplasma-causing sinusitis is uncommon. Reference: Prepladder Notes",
