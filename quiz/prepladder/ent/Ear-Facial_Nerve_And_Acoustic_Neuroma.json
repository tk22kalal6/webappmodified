Treatment of choice of acoustic neuroma is surgery Treatment Details Surgery Treatment of choice. The surgical approach depends on the tumor size. Radiotherapy Conventional radiotherapy by external beam is not suitable due to low CNS tolerance to radiation. X-knife or Gamma knife surgery: Form of stereotactic radiotherapy Focuses radiation on the tumor, minimizing the effect on surrounding normal tissue Arrests tumor growth and can reduce size Used for patients who refuse or are contraindicated for surgery, or with residual tumor after surgery.

      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Correct answer: C) Cranial nerves V and VII Explanation: Electrodiagnostic tests are useful to differentiate between neurapraxia and degeneration of the nerve and also help to predict the prognosis and indicate time for surgical decompression of the nerve. Different electrodiagnostic tests are: Blink Reflex Test: Purpose : This test evaluates the integrity of both the trigeminal nerve (afferent pathway) and the facial nerve (efferent pathway). It involves stimulating the supraorbital nerve and recording the reflexive blink response in both eyes. Clinical Significance: An absent or delayed response, particularly the R2 component, can indicate damage to the facial nerve or brainstem. Electromyography (EMG): Purpose : Assesses the electrical activity of muscles at rest and during voluntary contraction. Helps to determine the extent of muscle denervation and reinnervation. In normal resting muscle, biphasic or triphasic potentials are seen every 30-50ms. In a denervated muscle, involuntary action potentials called fibrillation potentials appear after 14-21 days. They appear 6-12 weeks prior to clinical evidence of facial function and provide the earliest evidence of recovery Electroneurography (ENoG): Purpose: Measures the compound muscle action potential (CMAP) generated by facial muscles in response to electrical stimulation of the facial nerve. It is used to quantify the degree of facial nerve degeneration. ENoG is most useful between 4-21 days of onset of complete paralysis. Minimum Nerve Excitability Test: The nerve is stimulated at steadily increasing intensity till facial twitch is seen which is compared with the normal side. When the difference between the two sides exceeds 3.5m amp , the test is positive for degeneration. Degeneration of fibres cannot be detected earlier than 48-72 hours. Maximum Stimulation Test(MST): In this test the current level which gives maximum facial movement is determined and compared with the normal side. Reduced or absent response with maximum stimulation indicates degeneration and is followed by incomplete recovery.

      "explanation": "Correct Answer: B) 2,3,4 Explanation: Origin: The facial nerve arises from the pons, a part of the brainstem, at the pontomedullary junction. Pathway: After its origin, the facial nerve enters the internal acoustic meatus along with the vestibulocochlear nerve (CN VIII). (Statement 4) It then travels through the facial canal within the temporal bone. Key Structures Along Its Course Geniculate Ganglion: Located within the facial canal, this is a sensory ganglion where the nerve fibers for taste (from the anterior two-thirds of the tongue) and some general sensory fibers synapse. Branches within the Facial Canal: Greater Petrosal Nerve: Arises from the geniculate ganglion, carrying parasympathetic fibers to the lacrimal gland and nasal mucosa. (Statement 3) Chorda Tympani: This branch arises after the geniculate ganglion and carries taste fibers from the anterior two-thirds of the tongue and parasympathetic fibers to the submandibular and sublingual salivary glands. Exit from the Skull Stylomastoid Foramen: The facial nerve exits the skull here, located between the styloid and mastoid processes of the temporal bone. (Statement 2) Extracranial part of facial nerve: Entry into Parotid Gland Main trunk enters on the posteromedial surface of the parotid gland. Division of Nerve Divides within the gland, behind and superficial to the retromandibular vein (Statement 1) and external carotid artery (ECA).

      "question": "A 55-year-old patient experiences sudden right-sided facial drooping and weakness in the left arm and leg following a stroke. The stroke is in the ventral part of the pons (basis pontis). Infranuclear fascicular fibers of cranial nerve VII (CN VII) ipsilaterally and the corticospinal tract contralaterally are affected. What is the diagnosis?",

        "A": "Foville Syndrome",

      },
      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: C) Millard-Gubler Syndrome Explanation: Millard-Gubler Syndrome (MGS) Caused by a lesion in the ventral part of the pons (basis pontis) The lesion involves the infranuclear fascicular fibers of cranial nerve VII (CN VII) ipsilaterally and the corticospinal tract contralaterally. Results in: Ipsilateral peripheral facial paralysis. Contralateral hemiplegia. Cranial nerve VI (CN VI) involvement sometimes Foville syndrome: Caused by a lesion in pons Ipsilateral facial palsy Horizontal gaze palsy Contralateral hemiparesis Ipsilateral Horner syndrome Loss of hearing Facial pain or temperature sensation Contralateral loss of vibration, fine touch, and proprioception Wallenberg syndrome: Caused by a lesion in brainstem Difficulty swallowing Dizziness or vertigo Problems with balance and walking Involuntary eye movements (nystagmus) Loss of pain or temperature sensation on one side of the body Hoarseness Loss of taste Facial pain Weber syndrome: Caused by a lesion in midbrain Drooping eyelid Double vision Partial or complete weakness in the arm and leg on contralateral side of the body Pupils may be dilated and unresponsive if both upper and middle midbrain are affected Contralateral ataxia may be present There may be a parkinsonian type of rigidity Reference: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK532907/",
