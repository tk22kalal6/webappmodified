      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: C) Organ of Corti Explanation: Organ of Corti is located in the cochlea. It is the primary structure responsible for converting sound vibrations into nerve impulses. Thus damage here leads to sensorineural hearing loss , which aligns with the patient's symptoms and audiogram findings. Important Components of Organ of Corti: Tunnel of Corti: Formed by inner and outer rods and contains cortilymph. Hair cells: Important receptor cells of hearing and transduce sound energy into electrical energy. Inner hair cells Outer hair cells Total count and Rows 3500 and 1 row 12,000 and 3-4 rows Shape Flask shaped Cylindrical shape Nerve supply Mainly afferent Mainfly efferent Function Transmit auditory stimuli More resistant Modulate function of inner hair cells. Easily damaged by ototoxic drugs and high-intensity noise Supporting cells/Deiters cells: Situated between the Outer hair cells and provide support to the latter. Cells of hensen lie outside deiters cells. Tectorial membrane: Consists of gelatinous matrix with delicate fibres. Over lies organ of Corti Malleus (Option A): Ossicles in the middle ear that transmits sound from the tympanic membrane to the inner ear. Issues with the malleus would lead to conductive hearing loss, not the sensorineural hearing loss seen in this patient. Eustachian tube (Option B): Dysfunction can cause middle ear effusions and conductive hearing loss, but it is unlikely to cause the sensorineural hearing loss observed in this patient. Semicircular canals (Option D): Disorders of these structures typically cause vertigo rather than hearing loss. They are not the likely cause of the hearing symptoms described.",

        "A": "Apex of the cochlea",
        "B": "Base of the cochlea",
        "C": "Middle of the cochlea",
        "D": "Near the helicotrema"
      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: B) Base of the cochlea Explanation: The length of the basilar membrane increases as we proceed from basal coil to apical coil. Therefore, higher frequencies are heard at basal coil while lower ones are heard at apical coil. Example : Menieres disease early stage affects apex of cochlea and hence low freq hearing loss seen(upsloping audiogram).Later stages show a high freq hearing loss (downsloping) Cochlea: Part of bony labyrinth making 2.5-2.75 turns around central pyramid of bone called modiolus. Around the modiolus and winding spirally like a thread of screw is thin plate of bone called osseous spiral lamina. Bony cochlea contains three compartments: Scala Vestibuli: The uppermost chamber of the cochlea filled with perilymph fluid and begins at the oval window where sound vibrations enter from the middle ear. Scala Media (Cochlear Duct): The middle chamber of the cochlea filled with endolymph fluid and houses the organ of Corti, which contains the hair cells responsible for converting sound vibrations into electrical signals. Three walls of cochlear duct are formed by: Basilar Membrane Reissner's Membrane Stria vascularis: Contains vascular epithelium concerned with secretion of endolymph. Scala Tympani: The lowermost chamber of the cochlea, filled with perilymph fluid and ends at the round window, where sound waves dissipate. Helicotrema: The apex of the cochlea where the scala vestibuli and scala tympani meet and allows the passage of perilymph fluid between these two chambers. The scala tympani is connected with the subarachnoid space through the aqueduct of cochlea. Apex of the cochlea (Option A): The apex of the cochlea is where the basilar membrane is wider and more flexible. It primarily detects low-frequency sounds, not high-frequency sounds. Middle of the cochlea (Option C): The middle portion of the cochlea detects mid-range frequencies. While it plays a role in sound detection, it is not responsible for high-frequency sounds. Near the helicotrema (Option D): The helicotrema is the part of the cochlear apex where the scala tympani and scala vestibuli meet. This region is involved in detecting very low-frequency sounds, not high-frequency ones.",

        "D": "Spherical recess"
      },
      "correct_answer": "D",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: D) Spherical recess Explanation The spherical recess houses the saccule, which detects linear acceleration, but not the utricle. Parts of the Inner Ear The inner ear, or labyrinth, is essential for hearing and balance and is located within the temporal bone. It consists of the bony labyrinth and the membranous labyrinth. Bony Labyrinth A rigid structure filled with perilymph (a sodium-rich fluid), it has three main parts: Vestibule : Central part connecting to the cochlea and semicircular canals. Bony Recesses in the vestibule contains the utricle and saccule (part of the membranous labyrinth). Spherical Recess: Contains the saccule, a membranous sac involved in detecting linear acceleration and deceleration. Elliptical Recess: Contains the utricle, which works with the saccule to aid in balance and spatial orientation. Oval Window: Located on the vestibule’s lateral wall, it connects to the middle ear. Openings of the Semicircular Canals: The three semicircular canals (lateral, posterior, and superior) have five openings into the vestibule, enabling detection of head rotations. Opening of the Vestibular Aqueduct: Positioned below the elliptical recess, it allows the passage of the endolymphatic duct, which carries endolymph within the membranous labyrinth. Semicircular Canals: Three canals (lateral, posterior, and superior) positioned at right angles to detect rotational head movement. Each has an ampulla containing the crista ampullaris for sensory function. Cochlea: A spiral structure essential for hearing, divided into three chambers (scala vestibuli, scala tympani, and scala media). The scala vestibuli and tympani contain perilymph and communicate via the helicotrema, while the scala media houses the organ of Corti, which converts sound vibrations into electrical signals. Membranous Labyrinth A delicate system within the bony labyrinth, filled with potassium-rich endolymph, it includes: Cochlear Duct (Scala Media): Inside the cochlea, it separates the scala vestibuli and scala tympani and contains the organ of Corti for hearing. Utricle and Saccule: Membranous sacs in the vestibule responsible for detecting linear acceleration and balance. They are connected via the utriculosaccular duct. Semicircular Ducts: Membranous ducts within the bony semicircular canals, contributing to balance. Endolymphatic Duct and Sac: Extending from the utricle and saccule, the duct ends in the endolymphatic sac, important in surgical treatments for conditions like Ménière's disease. Vestibular aqueduct (Option B): The vestibular aqueduct transmits the endolymphatic duct but does not house the utricle or saccule. Semicircular canals (Option C): The semicircular canals detect rotational head movements but do not contain the utricle or saccule.",

        "C": "Korner's septum",
        "D": "Tegmen tympani"
      },
      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: C) Korner's septum Explanation Complete removal of Korner's septum is crucial to access deeper petrosal cells and eliminate diseased tissue during mastoidectomy. Korner's septum Korner's septum is a bony plate in the mastoid, separating the superficial squamosal air cells from the deeper petrosal air cells. It is a remnant of the developmental petrosquamous suture. Surgical Importance During Mastoidectomy: Korner's septum is important when removing infected mastoid air cells. Challenges in Locating the Antrum: A prominent Korner's septum can block access to the mastoid antrum, complicating surgery. Incomplete Disease Removal: If Korner's septum is not fully removed, deeper infected air cells may be missed, leading to persistent or recurrent infection. Sigmoid sinus (Option A): The sigmoid sinus is located posterior to the mastoid antrum, but it does not directly obstruct access to the deeper air cells during mastoidectomy. Facial nerve (Option B): While the facial nerve is an important structure to avoid during mastoid surgery, it does not form obstruction to the deeper mastoid air cells. Tegmen tympani (Option D): The tegmen tympani forms the roof of the middle ear cavity and does not obstruct the deeper mastoid air cells.",

      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: B) Foramen of Huschke Explanation: Foramen of Huschke: A deficiency in the anteroinferior bony EAC, present in some children under four and occasionally into adulthood. It allows infection to spread between the parotid gland and the EAC. (Option B) Fissures of Santorini: Two gaps in the cartilage of the outer EAC that allow infection to pass between the parotid glands and the EAC. Isthmus: A narrowing in the bony EAC, about 6 mm lateral to the tympanic membrane. It is not an opening but a constriction in the canal. (Option C) Tympanic membrane (Option D) : The tympanic membrane separates the external ear from the middle ear and is not involved in spreading infections to the parotid gland. Mastoid Air Cells (Option A) : Mastoid air cells are a series of air-filled spaces located within the mastoid process of the temporal bone, adjacent to the middle ear. While infections in the middle ear (otitis media) can spread to the mastoid air cells (causing mastoiditis), they do not directly connect the EAC to the parotid gland. Thus, they are not responsible for the spread of infection between these two areas.",

        "D": "Mastoid air cells"
      },
      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: C) Cartilaginous part of the external auditory canal Explanation: Furuncles commonly form in the outer third of the canal, which is the cartilaginous portion containing hair follicles and ceruminous glands, making it prone to infections. External auditory canal Connects outer ear to middle ear, from the concha to the tympanic membrane (eardrum). Length & Shape: Approximately 24 mm long (posterior wall). Outer part angles upwards, backwards, and medially. Inner part angles downwards, forwards, and medially. Pinna must be pulled upwards, backwards, and laterally to view the eardrum. Parts Cartilaginous Part (Outer third, approximately 8 mm): Continuous with pinna cartilage. Fissures of Santorini allow infection to spread. Thick skin with ceruminous glands and hair follicles. Furuncles form here. (Option C) Bony Part (Inner two-thirds, approximately 16 mm): Thin skin extends over the tympanic membrane. No hair or ceruminous glands. Isthmus makes foreign body removal difficult. Anterior recess collects debris in infections. Foramen of Huschke (in children) allows infection to spread. Relations Superior: Middle cranial fossa Posterior: Mastoid air cells, facial nerve Inferior: Parotid gland Anterior: Temporomandibular joint (TMJ) Bony part of the external auditory canal (Option A): The bony part of the canal lacks hair follicles and ceruminous glands, which are necessary for furuncle formation. Tympanic membrane (Option B): The tympanic membrane is part of the middle ear and does not have structures like hair follicles that lead to furuncle formation in the external auditory canal. Mastoid air cells (Option D): The mastoid air cells are located posterior to the ear and are not directly involved in the external auditory canal's inflammation or furuncle formation.",

      },
      "correct_answer": "D",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: D) Conchal cartilage Explanation : Conchal cartilage is commonly harvested for reconstructive procedures, especially for correcting nasal bridge deformities due to its structural properties if septal cartilage is unavailable. Auricle (Pinna) Structure : Visible part of the ear, composed of yellow elastic cartilage covered by skin, except for the lobule and outer EAC. The skin on the outer surface adheres tightly to the perichondrium; on the inner surface, it is slightly looser. Contains elevations and depressions; the incisura terminalis (between the tragus and helix) lacks cartilage, aiding in surgical access to the EAC and mastoid. (Option C) Surgical Importance: The pinna provides graft materials for reconstructive surgeries, especially in the middle ear. Cartilage and perichondrium from the tragus or concha. (Option B) Fat from the lobule. (Option A) Conchal cartilage can be used to correct nasal bridge deformities. (Option D) Composite grafts of skin and cartilage from the pinna are used for nasal ala repairs. Incisura terminalis- Area where there is no cartilage between the tragus and crus of the helix. An incision (lempert incision) will not cut through the cartilage if made here. Used for endaural approach in surgery of the external auditory canal or of the mastoid.",
