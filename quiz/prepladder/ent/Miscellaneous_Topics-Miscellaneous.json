      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: B) Non-traumatic atlantoaxial subluxation secondary to infection Explanation: The child developed painful torticollis following a recent adenoidectomy , which is characteristic of Grisel's syndrome . This condition typically occurs due to nontraumatic causes such as an infection or surgery in the head and neck region. Grisel's Syndrome Etiology Nontraumatic atlantoaxial subluxation (Option B), often secondary to upper respiratory infections or post-surgery in the head and neck region (e.g., adenoidectomy). Pathophysiology Loosening of the transverse and alar ligaments due to inflammation in the atlantoaxial joint. Presentation Painful torticollis neck stiffness \"Cock-robin\" head position. Imaging X-ray or CT shows rotational subluxation of C1-C2. Management Early intervention with bed rest Cervical immobilization Antibiotics Anti-inflammatory agents to prevent neurological sequelae. Complications of adenoidectomy Hemorrhage (most common) Primary hemorrhage: Occurs intraoperatively from the surgical site. Reactionary hemorrhage (within 24 hours of the surgery): occurs due to the displaced clot or slippage of ligature. Secondary hemorrhage(24 hours upto 14 days of surgery): Occurs due to infection. Injury to pharyngeal musculature and cervical vertebrae. Injury to Eustachian tube opening. Grisel's syndrome Velopharyngeal insufficiency Nasopharyngeal stenosis Recurrence Grisel's syndrome is specifically a nontraumatic condition, unlike traumatic subluxations caused by direct cervical injury (Option A). Grisel's syndrome involves atlantoaxial subluxation (C1-C2), not atlanto-occipital dislocation (Option C) . It can be seen with congenital syndromes such as Down and Marfan which have increased ligament looseness. Cervical disc herniation (Option D) can cause neck pain and radiculopathy but does not explain the specific findings of atlantoaxial subluxation seen in Grisel’s syndrome.",

        "D": "Horizontal incision on the spur"
      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: B) Hemitransfixion incision Explanation: The patient has a caudal septal dislocation , which refers to a deviation or dislocation of the septal cartilage near the base of the nose (caudal end), for which either transfixion or hemitransfixion incision can be used. In this situation, the surgeon wants to access and correct the dislocated part without making an incision through the entire thickness of the septum. Hence, Hemitransfixion incision is appropriate in this scenario. Types of septal incisions for septoplasty Killian’s (Option A) In the nasal mucosa, cephalic to the caudal end of the septum Slightly curvilinear incision, 2-3 mm above the caudal end of septal cartilage on the concave side. Transfixion (Option C) Through and through incision , close to but caudal to caudal end of the septum. Used in caudal septal dislocation Hemitransfixion (Freer’s incision) (Option B) Same as the transfixion incision but on one side , not through and through. Used in caudal septal dislocation Septocolumellar incision between caudal end of septal cartilage and columella. Horizontal on the Spur (Option D) For endoscopic spurectomy. Mnemonic : Killian incision kills the septum, more complications, not done frequently Freer's incision -frees the septum, lesser complications, more commonly done",

      "question": "A 45-year-old male presents with severe nasal obstruction, headaches, and a history of multiple nasal surgeries for chronic sinusitis and nasal polyps. On endoscopic examination, there is extensive polyposis with distortion of normal anatomical landmarks. The surgeon decides to use a posterior-to-anterior surgical approach for better access and disease clearance. Which surgical technique is most appropriate in this case?",

        "A": "Stammberger’s technique",
        "B": "Wigand’s technique",
        "C": "Messerklinger’s approach",
        "D": "Caldwell-Luc procedure"
      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: B) Wigand’s technique Explanation: The Wigand technique, which proceeds from posterior to anterior, is ideal for cases of extensive polyposis or revision surgeries where anatomical landmarks have been distorted. In this scenario, the patient has undergone multiple surgeries, making this approach more suitable to ensure complete disease clearance along the skull base and medial orbital wall. Surgical approaches used in functional endoscopic sinus surgery (FESS): Stammberger’s technique (Option A) (Anterior to Posterior): The surgery starts at the uncinate process (anterior part) and moves backward towards the sphenoid sinus. Advantage: It allows the surgeon to tailor the extent of surgery based on the disease's progression. This approach is beneficial in cases of early disease or localized pathology. This is a more conservative technique. Wigand’s technique (Option B) (Posterior to Anterior): The surgery begins at the sphenoid sinus (posterior part) and proceeds forward along the base of the skull and the medial orbital wall. It is typically used in cases of extensive polyposis or during revision surgeries where previous surgeries have altered anatomical landmarks. This technique involves a more aggressive approach , often required for advanced disease with significant anatomical distortion. The Messerklinger approach (Option C) (similar to the Stammberger’s technique) is widely used for managing early disease affecting the anterior sinuses. The Caldwell-Luc procedure (Option D) is a surgical technique used to access the maxillary sinus by creating an opening in the anterior wall of the sinus, typically through the canine fossa. It is commonly performed to remove chronic infections, polyps, or tumors from the maxillary sinus. Reference: Dhingra Diseases of the Ear, Nose and Throat. Ed.8, page 494, 495.",

      "explanation": "Correct Answer: B) Myringoplasty using a temporalis fascia graft Explanation: Myringoplasty is indicated in cases of dry tympanic membrane perforation to restore hearing. A graft such as temporalis fascia is commonly used. Myringoplasty (Type I tympanoplasty) (Option B) Purpose : Repair of tympanic membrane perforation using a graft (e.g., temporalis fascia, perichondrium, dura, vein, fascia, cadaver membrane). Techniques : Underlay Technique : Graft is placed medial to the perforation and supported by gelfoam. Overlay Technique : Graft is placed lateral to the fibrous layer after removing squamous epithelium. Indications Used to treat conductive hearing loss due to tympanic membrane perforation. Not indicated for treating otitis media with effusion (fluid accumulation without perforation). Hearing Improvement Hearing loss from tympanic membrane perforation : 10–40 dB. Hearing loss from ossicular interruption with an intact tympanic membrane: 54 dB. In chronic otitis media, the procedure is delayed until the ear is dry and free from cholesteatoma (a destructive epithelial growth in the middle ear). Myringotomy (Option A ruled out) A small incision made in the tympanic membrane to relieve pressure due to fluid buildup. Indications : Acute otitis media with pus under tension. Acute suppurative otitis media. Otitis media with effusion (when other treatments fail). Grommet (Tympanostomy Tube) (Options A & C ruled out) A small tube inserted during myringotomy to facilitate continued fluid drainage. Primarily used to treat otitis media with effusion . Antibiotic therapy with corticosteroids (Option D) : This treatment is useful in active infections but not in repairing perforations or addressing hearing loss.",

Curette inserted under the soft palate, tissue removed using an inferior to superior motion. (Option D ruled out) Mollison's Tonsillar Dissector and Anterior Pillar Retractor Purpose : Specialized instrument used in tonsillectomy procedures for enhanced visibility and separation of tonsil tissue. Tonsillar Dissector : Used to separate the tonsil from its surrounding capsule. Facilitates the removal of the tonsil from the tonsillar bed. Anterior Pillar Retraction : Retracts the anterior pillar to improve visibility of the tonsillar fossa. Essential for examining the area for bleeding or remaining tissue post-removal. Additional Uses : Can retract the soft palate and uvula. Aids in overall surgical access and visibility. Eve's Tonsillar Snare Purpose : Specialized instrument used in tonsillectomy to remove tonsils and minimize bleeding.
