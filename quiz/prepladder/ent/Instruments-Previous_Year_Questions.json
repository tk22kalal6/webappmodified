      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "primarily in ear surgery (otology). It is designed to retract soft tissues such as skin or mucosa in the ear during procedures, providing better visibility and access to the surgical site. Types of Mastoid Retractors Mollison’s Mastoid Retractor: Self-retaining Hemostatic (stops bleeding) (Mnemonic: Mollison has 8 letters , so it has 4*4 teeth for identification) Jansen’s Mastoid Retractor: Self-retaining Similar to Mollison’s Use: Both retractors are used after incision and flap elevation to retract soft tissues. (Mnemonic: Jansen has 6 letters, so it has 3*3 teeth for identification) Lempert’s endaural retractor: Endaural approach during ear surgery. Lempert’s endaural speculum: Opens the meatus for endaural incision or local injections. Perkin’s mastoid retractor: Self retaining Hemostatic Use : For retraction of soft tissue during mastoidectomy. Incorrect Options: Plester's Retractor (Option A) : This is a type of retractor used in various surgical fields, particularly in orthopedic procedures, to retract tissues and provide better exposure during surgery. Wietlaner’s Retractor (Option B) : This is a self-retaining retractor used in surgery to retract tissue and maintain an open wound or incision. It is commonly used in ENT and general surgery. Jansens Retractor (Option D) : This is a type of retractor used in ear and nasal surgeries for retracting soft tissues and providing better surgical access.",
