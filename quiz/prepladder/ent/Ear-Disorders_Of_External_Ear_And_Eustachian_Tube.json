      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "structures. Correct Answer: B) Typically involves abnormalities in the middle ear, inner ear, and possibly other structures. Explanation: Atresia associated with microtia often includes additional abnormalities in the middle ear, inner ear, and other structures, and is often part of various syndromes like Treacher-Collins, Goldenhar, and Crouzon syndromes. Atresia of the External Ear Canal: Congenital atresia of the external auditory canal can occur by itself or alongside microtia. When it occurs alone, it results from the failure of the ectodermal core to canalize. causing the outer meatus to be blocked by fibrous tissue or bone, while the deep meatus and tympanic membrane remain unaffected. Atresia associated with microtia is more frequent and may also involve abnormalities in the middle ear, inner ear, and other structures, Often a part of various syndromes like Treacher-Collins, Goldenhar, and Crouzon syndromes. Hearing aids or bone conduction devices can help improve hearing in most cases. Surgical reconstruction like atresioplasty (canaloplasty) anterior and posterior approaches is possible in some patients, typically performed around age 6 or older. Fig: Atresia of the EAC Due to the failure of the tympanic membrane development (Option A): Congenital atresia is caused by the failure of canalization of the ectodermal core, not by issues with the tympanic membrane. The tympanic membrane typically remains unaffected in isolated atresia cases. Hearing aids or bone conduction devices are generally ineffective for this condition (Option C): Hearing aids or bone conduction devices can help improve hearing in cases of atresia by bypassing the blocked ear canal and directly stimulating the auditory system. Surgical reconstruction is commonly performed before age 5 (Option D): Surgical reconstruction for atresia is typically performed around age 6 or older, allowing for better surgical outcomes and optimal hearing restoration.",

      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: C) IV gentamicin with ticarcillin for 6 weeks with strict glucose control surrounding tissues, including bone. It is particularly serious in diabetic and immunocompromised patients and is often caused by Pseudomonas aeruginosa . IV gentamicin combined with ticarcillin is effective against Pseudomonas aeruginosa , the causative organism in malignant otitis externa. The treatment duration is typically 6-8 weeks, and strict glucose control is essential for optimal infection management in diabetic patients. Malignant (Necrotizing) Otitis Externa (MOE) Inflammatory condition caused by Pseudomonas infection. Commonly affects elderly diabetic patients or those on immunosuppressive therapy. Severe ear pain, granulations in the ear canal, and facial paralysis are common symptoms. Infection can spread to the skull base, jugular foramen, and cause multiple cranial nerve palsies. Fig: Malignant otitis externa Etiopathogenesis: Early presentation mimics diffuse otitis externa but with intense pain. Granulations in the ear canal indicate disease progression. Infection can extend: Anteriorly to the temporomandibular fossa. Posteriorly to the mastoid. Medially into the middle ear and petrous bone. Investigations: Clinical suspicion based on severe otalgia and granulation tissue in elderly diabetics. Imaging: CT scan/MRI : Shows bone destruction and soft tissue involvement. Gallium-67 scan : Indicates soft tissue infection; useful for diagnosis and follow-up. Technetium-99 bone scan : Detects bone infection but not useful for disease monitoring due to prolonged positivity. Treatment: Control of diabetes : Essential for management. Ear canal toilet : Clean the ear, remove discharge, debris, and granulations. Antibiotics : IV Gentamicin with Ticarcillin (both ototoxic/nephrotoxic). Third-generation cephalosporins (e.g., Ceftriaxone or Ceftazidime ), combined with an aminoglycoside. Quinolones (e.g., Ciprofloxacin 750 mg orally) can be combined with Rifampin . Antibiotic therapy typically lasts 6-8 weeks or longer. Culture and sensitivity of ear discharge to adjust antibiotics if non-responsive to treatment. Prolonged antibiotic treatment has largely replaced the need for radical surgery. Topical antibiotics with ear canal cleaning only (Option A): This is insufficient for treating MOE, a deep infection involving the skull base. Systemic antibiotics are essential to eradicate the infection, and topical treatment alone cannot penetrate deep tissues. Strict diabetes control with surgical debridement (Option B): While controlling diabetes is important in managing MOE, surgical debridement is no",

        "D": "Ear canal irrigation with saline"
      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: B) Topical antifungal treatment with ear canal cleaning Explanation: The patient's symptoms, along with the appearance of a black and filamentous fungal mass in the ear canal, are consistent with otomycosis , a fungal infection of the ear canal. The recent use of topical antibiotics suggests that secondary fungal growth may have occurred due to the disruption of normal ear flora. The appropriate initial management for otomycosis involves cleaning the ear canal to remove debris and fungal material, followed by the application of topical antifungal agents. This approach directly targets the fungal infection and provides symptomatic relief. Otomycosis Causes: Fungal infection of the ear canal, commonly caused by: Aspergillus niger Aspergillus fumigatus Candida albicans Often occurs in hot, humid climates (tropical and subtropical regions). Secondary fungal growth can follow topical antibiotic use for otitis externa or middle ear infections. Clinical Features: Intense itching Discomfort or pain in the ear Watery discharge with a musty odor Ear blockage Fungal mass appearance: white, brown, or black, resembling wet filter paper Otoscopic findings: A. niger : Black-headed filamentous growth A. fumigatus : Pale blue or green growt h Candida : White or creamy deposit Meatal skin: Sodden, red, and oedematous Fig: Otomycosis Treatment: Ear Toilet: Remove discharge and epithelial debris using syringing, suction, or mopping. Antifungal Agents: Nystatin (100,000 units/mL in propylene glycol) for Candida Clotrimazole and povidone iodine (broad-spectrum antifungals) 2% salicylic acid in alcohol (keratolytic agent to remove superficial epidermal layers and fungal mycelia) Duration: Continue antifungal treatment for a week even after apparent cure to prevent recurrence. Additional Measures: Keep the ear dry Treat associated bacterial infections with antibiotic/steroid preparations to reduce inflammation and edema, enhancing antifungal agent penetration. Topical antibiotic ear drops for another 3 weeks (Option A): The presence of a black, filamentous fungal mass indicates a fungal infection, not a bacterial one. Topical antibiotics are not effective against fungi and would not address the underlying fungal problem. Intravenous antifungal therapy (Option C) is typically reserved for severe or systemic fungal infections. Otomycosis is generally localized and can be managed effectively with topical antifungal agents and ear canal cleaning. Ear canal irrigation with saline (Option D): While cleaning the ear canal is important, saline irrigation alone does not address the fungal infection. Topical antifungal treatment is",

        "D": "Foreign body"
      },
      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: C) Keratosis obturans Explanation: Keratosis obturans is characterized by the accumulation of excess keratin in the ear canal, which forms a hard, waxy plug. This condition can lead to symptoms such as a feeling of fullness in the ear, itching, and decreased hearing. Keratosis Obturans: The collection of a pearly white mass of desquamated epithelial cells in the deep meatus is called keratosis obturans. This, by its pressure effect, causes absorption of bone leading to the widening of the meatus so much so that the facial nerve may be exposed and paralyzed. Aetiology It is commonly seen between 5 and 20 years and may affect one or both ears. It may sometimes be associated with bronchiectasis and chronic sinusitis. Normally, epithelium from the surface of the tympanic membrane migrates onto the posterior meatal wall. Failure of this migration or obstruction to migration caused by wax may lead to accumulation of the epithelial plug in the deep meatus. Clinical features: Presenting symptoms may be pain in the ear, hearing loss, tinnitus, and sometimes ear discharge. On examination, the ear canal may be full of a pearly white mass of keratin material disposed of in several layers(given in the image below) Removal of this mass may show a widening of bony meatus with ulceration and even granuloma formation. Treatment: Keratotic mass is removed either by syringing or instrumentation, similar to the techniques employed for impacted wax. Secondary otitis externa may be present and should be treated. Patients should be periodically checked and any reaccumulations removed. Recurrence can be checked to some extent by using keratolytic agents such as 2% salicylic acid in alcohol. Otitis externa (Option A) presents with complaints of Burning sensation, severe pain (worsened by jaw movement), serous discharge progressing to purulent, meatal swelling, conductive hearing loss, and tender lymph nodes Impacted wax (Option B) typically does not include the hardened, keratinized material as seen in keratosis obturans The foreign body (Option D) presents with clinical features of ear pain or discomfort, hearing loss, tinnitus, vertigo (rare), bleeding or discharge (if trauma occurs)",

It is often associated with viral infections, such as those causing upper respiratory symptoms, and can present with severe ear pain and hearing loss. Myringitis Bullosa Hemorrhagic Hemorrhagic bullae on the tympanic membrane is called Myringitis bullosa hemorrhagic Etiology: Streptococcus pneumoniae, mycoplasma, and influenza virus Clinical features: Severe pain in the ear canal Treatment: Systemic antibiotics should be given. Close follow-up is needed Fig: Myringitis Bullosa Haemorrhagica showing bullae on the outer surface of the tympanic membrane Traumatic Perforation of Tympanic Membrane High-pressure trauma causing perforation in the tympanic membrane is called Traumatic Perforation of the tympanic membrane Tympanic membrane may be ruptured by: Trauma due to a hairpin, matchstick or unskilled attempts to remove a foreign body. Sudden change in air pressure, e.g. a slap or a kiss on the ear or a sudden blast. Forceful Valsalva may rupture a thin atrophic membrane.

      "question": "A 30-year-old patient presents with a sensation of ear fullness and hearing their own voice loudly in their ear, especially when speaking or swallowing. What is the most likely diagnosis?",

        "D": "Acoustic neuroma"
      },
      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: A) Patulous Eustachian tube Explanation: Patulous Eustachian tube occurs when the Eustachian tube, which usually remains closed except during swallowing or yawning, remains abnormally open. This can lead to a sensation of ear fullness and an increased perception of one's voice, a condition known as autophony. In this condition, the eustachian tube is abnormally patent. Most of the time it is idiopathic but rapid weight loss, pregnancy (especially the third trimester), or multiple sclerosis can also cause it. The patient's chief complaints are hearing his own voice (autophony), and even his breath sounds. Due to abnormal patency, pressure changes in the nasopharynx are easily transmitted to the middle ear so much so that the movements of the tympanic can be seen with inspiration and expiration; these movements are further exaggerated if the patient breathes after closing the opposite nostril. Treatment: The acute condition of the patulous tube is self-limiting and does not require treatment. In others, weight gain, oral administration of potassium iodide is helpful but some long-standing cases may require cauterization of the tubes or insertion of a grommet. Otitis media with effusion (Option B) involves fluid buildup in the middle ear but typically presents with ear fullness and hearing loss without the characteristic symptom of autophony. Meniere’s disease (Option C) is associated with vertigo, tinnitus, and fluctuating hearing loss but does not usually cause autophony . Acoustic neuroma (Option D) is a tumor on the auditory nerve that can cause hearing loss, tinnitus, and balance issues but is not typically associated with the sensation of one's own voice being unusually loud.

      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: B) Administer supplemental oxygen and maintain gradual ascent Explanation: The aim is to restore middle ear aeration. Administering supplemental oxygen can help by increasing oxygen availability to tissues and aiding in the resolution of barotrauma. Gradual ascent allows the body to equilibrate pressure more safely and reduces the risk of worsening the condition. Barotrauma It is a nonsuppurative condition resulting from the failure of the eustachian tube to maintain middle ear pressure at ambient atmospheric level. The usual cause is rapid descent during an air flight, underwater diving, or compression in a pressure chamber i.e., moving from a low to high-pressure zone. Mechanism of Barotrauma: If the middle ear pressure is high, the eustachian tube allows easy and passive airflow from the middle ear to the pharynx. In the reverse situation, where nasopharyngeal air pressure is high, air cannot enter the middle ear unless the tube is actively opened by the contraction of muscles as in swallowing, yawning, or the Valsalva maneuver. When atmospheric pressure is higher than that of the middle ear by a critical level of 90 mm Hg, the eustachian tube gets “locked; i.e. soft tissues of the pharyngeal end of the tube are forced into its lumen. In the presence of eustachian tube edema, even smaller pressure differentials cause the “locking” of the tube. Sudden negative pressure in the middle ear causes retraction of the tympanic membrane, hyperemia and engorgement of vessels, transudation, and hemorrhages. Clinical features: Severe earache, hearing loss, and tinnitus are common complaints. Vertigo is uncommon. The tympanic membrane appears retracted and congested. It may get ruptured. The middle ear may show air bubbles or hemorrhagic effusion. Hearing loss is usually conductive but sensorineural type of loss may also be seen. Treatment: The aim is to restore middle ear aeration. This is done by catheterization or politzerization. In mild cases, decongestant nasal drops or oral nasal decongestants with antihistaminics and the Valsalva maneuver are helpful. In the presence of fluid or failure of the above methods, myringotomy may be performed to “unlock” the tube and aspirate the fluid. Prevention: Aero-otitis can be prevented by the following measures: 1. Avoid air travel in the presence of upper respiratory infection or allergy. 2. Swallow repeatedly during descent. Sucking sweets or chewing gum is useful. 3. Do not permit sleep during descent as the number of swallows normally decreases during sleep. 4. Autoinflation of the tube by Valsalva should be performed intermittently during descent. 5. Use vasoconstrictor nasal spray and a tablet of antihistaminic and systemic decongestant, half an hour before descent in persons with previous history of this episode. 6. In recurrent barotrauma, attention should be paid to nasal polyps, septal deviation, nasal allergy, and chronic sinus infections. Perform an immediate rapid ascent to the surface (Option A) Rapid ascent can exacerbate barotrauma and lead to additional complications like decompression",

      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "that air enters the eustachian tube. Correct Answer: B) The principle of the Valsalva is to build negative pressure in the nasopharynx so that air enters the eustachian tube. Explanation: The principle of the test is to build positive pressure in the nasopharynx so that air enters the eustachian tube. 1. Valsalva Test: To do this test, the patient pinches his nose between the thumb and index finger, takes a deep breath, closes his mouth, and tries to blow air into the ears. If air enters the middle ear, the tympanic membrane will move outwards, which can be verified by an otoscope or the microscope. In the presence of a tympanic membrane perforation, a hissing sound is produced or if the discharge is also present in the middle ear, a cracking sound will be heard. This test should be avoided : (i) In the presence of an atrophic scar of the tympanic membrane which can rupture (ii) In the presence of infection of the nose and nasopharynx where infected secretions are likely to be pushed into the middle ear causing otitis media. 2. Politzer Test: In this test, the olive-shaped tip of Politzer’s bag is introduced into the patient’s nostril on the side of which the tubal function is desired to be tested. The other nostril is closed, and the bag is compressed while at the same time, the patient swallows (he can be given sips of water) or says “ik, ik, ik.” By means of an auscultation tube, connecting the patient's ear under test to that of the examiner, a hissing sound is heard if the tube is patent. Compressed air can also be used instead of Politzer’s bag. The test is also used therapeutically to ventilate the middle ear. 3. Catheterization: In this test, the nose is first anesthetized by a topical spray of lignocaine and then a eustachian tube catheter, the tip of which is bent, is passed along the floor of nose till it reaches the nasopharynx (Option A) Here it is rotated 90° medially and gradually pulled back till it engages on the posterior border of the nasal septum. It is then rotated 180° laterally so that the tip lies against the tubal opening. A Politzer’s bag is now connected to the catheter and air insufflated. Entry of air into the middle ear is verified by an auscultation tube. The procedure of catheterization should be gentle as it is known to cause complications such as: Injury to eustachian tube opening which causes scarring later. Bleeding from the nose Transmission of nasal and nasopharyngeal infection into the middle ear causing otitis media. Rupture of atrophic area of tympanic membrane if too much pressure is used. 4. Toynbee’s Test: Toynbee’s maneuver causes negative pressure. It is a more physiological test. It is performed by asking the patient to swallow while the nose has been pinched. This draws air from the middle ear into the nasopharynx and causes inward movement tympanic membrane, which is verified by the examiner otoscopically or with a microscope. 5. Tympanometry (Also Called Inflation-Deflation Test): In this test, positive and negative pressures are created in the external ear canal and the patient swallows repeatedly",
