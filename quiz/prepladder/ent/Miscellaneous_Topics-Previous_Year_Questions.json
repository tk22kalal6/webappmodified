      "question": "Which structures are left intact during radical neck dissection?",
      "options": {
        "A": "Tall of parotid",
        "B": "Sublingual gland",
        "C": "Submandibular gland",
        "D": "Level 2b lymph nodes"
      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Correct Ans: B Sublingual gland: The sublingual gland is not removed in a radical neck dissection. Radical neck dissection is a surgical procedure performed to remove lymph nodes and other structures in the neck to treat head and neck cancers. The sublingual gland is located beneath the tongue and is not typically involved in lymph node metastasis or directly affected by head and neck cancers. Therefore, it is preserved during the surgical procedure. Option A. Tail of parotid: The tail of the parotid gland, which is the largest salivary gland located in the cheek, can be removed in certain cases of radical neck dissection if it is involved by tumour or affected by lymph node metastasis. Option C. Submandibular gland: The submandibular gland, another salivary gland located beneath the lower jaw, may be removed in specific cases of radical neck dissection if it is involved by tumour or affected by lymph node metastasis. Option D. Level 2b lymph nodes: Level 2b lymph nodes are typically included in a radical neck dissection. These lymph nodes are in the upper neck region, near the angle of the mandible. They are commonly removed to ensure adequate clearance of lymphatic tissue in cases of head and neck cancer. Reference: .",
