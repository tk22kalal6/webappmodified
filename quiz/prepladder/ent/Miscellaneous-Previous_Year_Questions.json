      "question": "What is the most probable reason for the swelling in the tonsils of a 40-year-old woman who has difficulty swallowing food, no past medical history of fever, sore throat, or smoking, but a family history of Marfan's syndrome in her father, and shows unilateral swelling of the tonsils along with pulsation upon oral examination?",
      "options": {
        "A": "Extracranial internal carotid artery aneurysm",
        "B": "Intracranial external carotid artery aneurysm",
        "C": "Extracranial external carotid artery aneurysm",
        "D": "Intracranial internal carotid artery aneurysm"
      },
      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: A) Extracranial Internal Carotid Artery Aneurysm Explanation: The unilateral tonsillar swelling with pulsation suggests a vascular etiology , and the presence of Marfan’s syndrome in the family history increases the likelihood of an aneurysm due to connective tissue disorder . The extracranial internal carotid artery (ICA) aneurysm is a rare but recognized cause of tonsillar swelling and can mimic a mass lesion. It is located medially to the tonsil and can be identified by pulsation on examination. Extracranial Internal Carotid Artery Aneurysm Feature Description Cause Weakening of ICA wall (due to atherosclerosis, Marfan’s syndrome, Ehlers-Danlos syndrome, infections, or trauma ) Symptoms 1. Unilateral tonsillar swelling 2. Dysphagia (difficulty swallowing) 3. Pulsation on oral exam 4. Absence of infection or inflammatory signs Risk Factors Connective tissue disorders (Marfan's, Ehlers-Danlos), atherosclerosis, hypertension Complications Rupture, thrombosis, stroke, or cranial nerve compression Diagnosis CT/MR angiography, Doppler ultrasound Treatment Surgical repair or endovascular stenting Incorrect Options: Intracranial External Carotid Artery Aneurysm (Option B): is incorrect because the external carotid artery does not run close to the tonsils, and intracranial aneurysms do not present as tonsillar swelling . Extracranial External Carotid Artery Aneurysm (Option C): is incorrect because the external carotid artery runs laterally in the neck , not medially near the tonsils. Intracranial Internal Carotid Artery Aneurysm (Option D): is incorrect because an intracranial ICA aneurysm presents with stroke-like symptoms (headache, visual disturbances, or cranial nerve palsies) rather than tonsillar swelling .

      "question": "Which is the false statement among the following for the condition given in the picture?",
      "options": {
        "A": "Retention cyst of major salivary glands",
        "B": "Most common site is lower lip",
        "C": "Retention cyst of minor salivary glands",
        "D": "Treatment is surgical excision"
      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "typically forms in the ductal system due to the blockage of the duct or ductal dilation. The most common sites for retention cysts of the major salivary glands are the parotid gland and the submandibular gland , not the lower lip , which is a common site for minor salivary gland cysts . Retention Cyst of Salivary Glands Feature Description Cause Blockage or damage to the duct system of the salivary gland leads to cyst formation. Location Major salivary glands (parotid, submandibular, and sublingual glands) for major retention cysts. Minor Salivary Glands Most often found on the lower lip , buccal mucosa , or palate for minor salivary glands . Treatment Surgical excision is the standard treatment to remove the cyst and prevent recurrence. Diagnosis Clinical examination and ultrasound or sialography for confirmation. Incorrect Options: Retention cyst of major salivary glands (Option A): is correct because major salivary gland retention cysts are commonly found on the lower lip . Retention cyst of minor salivary glands (Option C): is correct because minor salivary gland retention cysts can occur in the lower lip , and the condition is not false . Minor salivary glands are located throughout the oral cavity, including the lips, and these cysts are indeed more commonly found in the lower lip , not in the major salivary glands. Treatment is",

      "question": "A 23-year-old male patient visits you reporting a nasal discharge that appears like the image shown on a handkerchief. Which of the following characteristics aids in identifying the presence of CSF rhinorrhoea in this patient?",
      "options": {
        "A": "Halo sign",
        "B": "Handkerchief sign",
        "C": "Schwartz sign",
        "D": "Phelps sign"
      },
      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer A- Halo sign Explanation: The Halo sign is a classic characteristic used to identify CSF rhinorrhea . It is observed when nasal discharge on a handkerchief or tissue shows a central clear fluid surrounded by a ring of blood , creating a halo pattern. This indicates the presence of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) leaking from the subarachnoid space into the nasal cavity, usually due to a fracture in the skull base, often in the area around the ethmoid sinuses . CSF Rhinorrhea: CSF rhinorrhea occurs when cerebrospinal fluid leaks from the brain's subarachnoid space into the nasal cavity. This may be due to a skull base fracture , usually from trauma or surgery. The Halo sign is diagnostic when the fluid leaks from the nose and has a clear center with a blood ring around it, indicative of CSF. Symptoms often include clear nasal discharge , headaches , and a history of trauma . Incorrect Options: Handkerchief sign (Option B) : is incorrect because it is not a widely recognized term in clinical practice and does not specifically refer to the pattern seen in CSF rhinorrhea. Schwartz sign (Option C) : is incorrect because it refers to a sign used in Biermer's disease (megaloblastic anemia) and is unrelated to CSF rhinorrhea. Phelps sign (Option D) : is incorrect because it does not refer to any known clinical sign associated with CSF rhinorrhea.
