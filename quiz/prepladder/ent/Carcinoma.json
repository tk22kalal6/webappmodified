      "question": "A 60-year-old male with a history of persistent hoarseness, throat pain, and difficulty swallowing was recently diagnosed with Laryngeal Carcinoma. Which of the following is not a known risk factor for developing laryngeal cancer in this patient?",
      "options": {
        "A": "Heavy smoking and alcohol consumption",
        "B": "Genetic predisposition due to Fanconi anemia",
        "C": "Exposure to coal dust",
        "D": "Exposure to EBV"
      },
      "correct_answer": "D",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: D) Exposure to EBV Explanation: EBV are associated with Nasopharyngeal carcinoma and are less commonly linked to laryngeal cancer compared to other risk factors. Risk Factors and Etiology of Laryngeal Cancer: Tobacco Use :(most common cause) Smoking is a well-established risk factor due to carcinogens like benzopyrene and other hydrocarbons. Alcohol Consumption : Alcohol use is a significant risk factor, with a synergistic effect when combined with smoking. Synergistic Effect : The combined effect of tobacco and alcohol is greater than the sum of their individual effects and has a 15-fold increased risk of laryngeal cancer compared to using either factor alone. (Option A ruled out) Radiation Exposure : Previous radiation treatment to the neck for benign conditions or laryngeal papilloma can increase the risk of developing laryngeal cancer. Genetic Factors : Reports from Japanese and Russian studies suggest that genetic predisposition may play a role in familial cases of laryngeal cancer. Genetic syndromes like Fanconi anemia and congenital dyskeratosis are also associated with a higher risk. (Option B ruled out) Occupational Exposure : Exposure to occupational hazards such as asbestos, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, wood dust, coal dust, cement dust, mustard gas, and petroleum products has been linked to laryngeal cancer. (Option C ruled out) Demographic Data : Laryngeal cancer is significantly more common in males compared to females, with a reported incidence of 3.99% in males and 0.46% in females. Lower socioeconomic status and manual ‘blue-collar’ occupations also experience a higher risk. HPV HPV 6 and 11 cause juvenile respiratory papillomatosis which rarely undergoes malignant change Sexual behaviors and HPV infection are strongly associated with oropharyngeal cancers, but there is limited epidemiological evidence connecting these factors with laryngeal cancers. Unlike oropharyngeal cancer, current studies do not show an improved prognosis for HPV-positive laryngeal tumors.",

      "question": "A 58-year-old male presents with progressive hoarseness of voice and mild dyspnea on exertion. He underwent coronary artery bypass grafting 6 months ago. A fiberoptic laryngoscopy reveals left-sided vocal cord paralysis in the paramedian position. A chest CT scan shows no mediastinal mass or aortic enlargement. Electromyography of the laryngeal muscles reveals denervation. What is the most likely cause of his vocal cord paralysis?",
      "options": {
        "A": "Left atrial enlargement due to mitral valve disease",
        "B": "Post-surgical trauma to the recurrent laryngeal nerve (RLN)",
        "C": "Compression of the recurrent laryngeal nerve by aortic aneurysm",
        "D": "Idiopathic unilateral vocal cord paralysis"
      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: B) Post-surgical trauma to the recurrent laryngeal nerve (RLN) Explanation: The given scenario involves delayed unilateral vocal cord paralysis (ULVCP) following coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG), with an absence of extrinsic compressive factors like a mediastinal mass or aortic aneurysm. The left RLN is anatomically vulnerable during thoracic surgeries like CABG due to its course under the aortic arch. Surgical trauma, especially stretching or manipulation during cardiac or thoracic procedures, can result in delayed RLN injury, manifesting as vocal cord paralysis. Electromyography (EMG) showing denervation of laryngeal muscles supports a nerve injury rather than compression. Causes of Vocal Cord paralysis: Malignancy Iatrogenic surgical trauma Idiopathic Non-surgical trauma Intubation Neurological disorders Infections - Lyme disease, Herpes zoster, EBV, HSV, CMV, in immunocompromised patients. Surgical procedures associated with vocal cord paralysis: Cervical surgery Thyroidectomy/parathyroidectomy Carotid endarterectomy Anterior approach to the cervical spine Repair Zenker’s diverticulum Cricopharyngeal myotomy Thoracic procedures Thoracic aneurysm repair Pneumonectomy Aortic valve repair Coronary artery bypass grafting Esophageal or tracheal surgery Mediastinoscopy Ligation of patent ductus arteriosus Others Skull base or brainstem surgery Endotracheal intubation Causes of SLN Injury: Trauma - surgical or accidental Neuritis (mostly diphtheritic) Pressure by cervical nodes Involvement in a neoplastic process Causes of RLN Injury: Trauma to the neck Thyroid disease and surgery CA cervical esophagus, CA apex of right lung Cervical lymphadenopathy Subclavian artery aneurysm Tuberculosis of cervical pleura Idiopathic Additionally, the Left RLN (which has a longer course than the right) can be injured in the mediastinum due to: Bronchogenic cancer Carcinoma thoracic esophagus Aortic aneurysm Mediastinal lymphadenopathy Idiopathic Enlarged left auricle Intrathoracic surgery Left atrial enlargement due to mitral valve disease (Option A): While left atrial enlargement from mitral valve disease can compress the left RLN as it loops around the aortic arch (causing Ortner’s syndrome), this patient has no echocardiographic or clinical evidence of mitral valve disease or left atrial enlargement. Compression of the recurrent laryngeal nerve by aortic aneurysm (Option C): Aortic aneurysms can cause RLN compression, leading to left-sided vocal cord paralysis.",

      "question": "In a patient who has undergone a total laryngectomy, a portable vocal rehabilitation device needs to be prescribed immediately post-surgery. Choose the device from the given options:",

        "A": "Electrolarynx",
        "B": "Transoral pneumatic device",
        "C": "Blom-Singer or Panje prosthesis",
        "D": "Esophageal speech"
      },
      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: A) Electrolarynx Explanation: The electrolarynx allows for immediate speech production after surgery, making it a practical solution for patients who need to communicate right away. It is a transistorized, battery-operated portable device. Vocal rehabilitation-methods: After laryngectomy, the patient loses his speech completely. The various methods by which communication can be established are given below: Oesophageal Speech In this, the patient is taught to swallow air and hold it in the upper esophagus and then slowly eject it from the esophagus into the pharynx. The patient can speak 6-10 words before re-swallowing air. The voice is rough but loud and understandable. Artificial Larynx It is used in those who fail to learn oesophageal speech. Electrolarynx: Its vibrating disc is held against the soft tissues of the neck and a low-pitched sound is produced in the hypopharynx which is further modulated into speech by the tongue, lips, teeth, and palate. Transoral pneumatic device (Option B) It is a transoral device. Here vibrations produced in a rubber diaphragm are carried by a plastic tube into the back of the oral cavity where sound is converted into speech by modulators. This is a pneumatic type of device and uses expired air from the tracheostome to vibrate the diaphragm. Tracheo-Oesophageal Speech Here an attempt is made to carry air from the trachea to the esophagus or hypopharynx by the creation of a skin-lined fistula or by placement of an artificial prosthesis. The vibrating column of air entering the pharynx is then modulated into speech. This technique has the disadvantage of food entering the trachea. These days prostheses (Blom-Singer or Panje) are being used to shunt air from the trachea to the esophagus (Option C) They have inbuilt valves which work only in one direction thus preventing problems of aspiration.",

      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: A) Total laryngectomy Explanation: In the given case scenario of stage 3 laryngeal carcinoma with no involvement of thyroid cartilage since the patient is not willing to do chemoradiotherapy, total laryngectomy would be the treatment of choice. Treatment of Stage 3 and Stage 4A of Laryngeal Carcinoma: Concurrent Chemo-RT: for stage 3 and early stage 4 (Cisplatin/ Carboplatin/Cetuximab). This treatment is suitable for all the stage 3 & stage 4a cases which do not involve any cartilage(thyroid/cricoid). Near Total Laryngectomy: Stage 3 and Stage 4a cases with one arytenoid spared. It is the treatment of choice in stage 3 & stage 4a cases involving thyroid/cricoid cartilage. Total laryngectomy Indications: T4a with thyroid cartilage invasion. Stage 3 and 4a who cannot tolerate chemotherapy. Stage 3 and 4 recurrent tumours Bilateral arytenoid involvement. Conservative Surgery (Option B) is done in cases of recurrence when the radiation therapy fails to treat. Micro laryngeal surgery (Option C) is done for stages 1 and 2 when the carcinoma is in the middle 1 ⁄ 3 of the vocal cord. Vertical hemilaryngectomy (Option D) is done in cases of recurrence where one-half of the larynx (vertical) is involved along with subglottic extension not more than 1cm. This is a type of conservative surgery done in stages 1 and 2 of laryngeal carcinoma. Reference: Dhingra's Diseases Of Ear, Nose And Throat, & Head and Neck Surgery, 8th edition, Page 363",

      "correct_answer": "D",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: D) Vertical hemilaryngectomy Explanation: According to stage grouping, T2N0M0 glottic carcinoma is grouped under Stage II . For Stage II carcinoma along with impaired cord mobility, radiotherapy is not preferred because of the possibility of developing perichondritis which would require total laryngectomy afterwards. For these patients, the best option is to do conservative surgery such as vertical hemilaryngectomy . Treatment of Stage I and Stage II Laryngeal Carcinoma TNM Staging Stage Grouping Treatment T1N0M0 Stage I Glottic- Radiotherapy or Endoscopic CO2 laser resection Supraglottic- Radiotherapy or Endoscopic CO2 laser resection Subglottic- Radiotherapy T2N0M0 Stage II Glottic- Radiotherapy- when the cord is mobile Vertical hemilaryngectomy- when cord mobility is impaired or Involvement of anterior commissure/arytenoid Supraglottic- Supraglottic laryngectomy with/without neck dissection- when lung function is good Supraglottic laryngectomy with/without neck dissection + Radiotherapy- when lung function is poor Subglottic- Radiotherapy Total laryngectomy (Option A) is not the primary choice of treatment in T2 laryngeal carcinoma. It is mostly preferred for T3 and T4. Radiotherapy (Option B) alone will not be sufficient, as the patient has impaired vocal cord mobility and is showing vocal cord involvement. Endoscopic CO2 laser excision (Option C) is done only in cases where vocal cord mobility is not impaired.

      "question": "A 55-year-old male underwent total thyroidectomy for a large multinodular goiter. Postoperatively, he presents with complete loss of voice, frequent aspiration of liquids, and an inability to cough effectively. On laryngoscopy, both vocal cords are found in a cadaveric position, and there is no sensation in the larynx. He is also experiencing difficulty breathing and frequent episodes of bronchopneumonia.

      },
      "correct_answer": "D",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: D) Bilateral recurrent and superior laryngeal nerve paralysis Explanation: Bilateral recurrent and superior laryngeal nerve paralysis explains the complete loss of voice (aphonia), total paralysis of both vocal cords in the cadaveric position, laryngeal anesthesia, aspiration, and recurrent bronchopneumonia described in the scenario. It is a known complication of thyroid surgery. Feature Unilateral Combined Paralysis Bilateral Combined Paralysis Affected Nerves One side (Recurrent and Superior Laryngeal Nerves) Thyroid surgery is the most common cause. Both sides (Recurrent and Superior Laryngeal Nerves) Vocal Cord Position Paralyzed cord in cadaveric position (3.5 mm from midline) Healthy cord unable to fully approximate paralyzed cord Both cords in the cadaveric (Intermediate) position (neutral, apart from midline) Complete lack of movement in both cords Clinical Features All the muscles of the larynx on one side are paralyzed except the interarytenoid. Hoarseness : Due to glottic incompetence Aspiration : Liquids pass through the glottis Ineffective cough : Due to air waste from incomplete vocal fold closure Mild aspiration risk Breathing: Usually unaffected as airway remains adequate Speech: Weak or breathy, but functional All the laryngeal muscles are paralyzed. Total anesthesia of the larynx. Aphonia : Complete loss of voice as cords do not meet Severe aspiration : Total glottic incompetence, laryngeal anesthesia Inability to cough : Cords cannot meet to generate pressure for coughing Bronchopneumonia: Due to frequent aspiration of secretions into the lungs Respiratory distress : Due to compromised airway and retention of secretions Speech : Completely absent Treatment Voice therapy - for compensation by the healthy cord Injection laryngoplasty (temporary or permanent fillers) Thyroplasty Type I with or without arytenoid adduction Tracheostomy to clear pulmonary secretions Gastrostomy to prevent aspiration and maintain nutrition Epiglottopexy to prevent aspiration Vocal cord plication to prevent aspiration Total laryngectomy or diversion procedures in severe cases Bilateral superior laryngeal nerve paralysis (Option A) primarily affects the cricothyroid muscles , leading to a weak and husky voice, but not complete aphonia or significant airway obstruction. There is typically upper laryngeal anesthesia causing aspiration and coughing fits, but both vocal cords remain mobile. This does not fully explain the severe symptoms described in the scenario (total voice loss",

      "question": "A 45-year-old professional singer presents with complaints of vocal fatigue and difficulty producing high-pitched sounds for the last 3 months. She denies any difficulty in swallowing or breathing. On laryngoscopic examination, no significant abnormalities are seen, and one vocal cord appears to be in normal resting position while other vocal cord is in abducted position . What is the most likely diagnosis?",
      "options": {
        "A": "Bilateral SLN palsy",
        "B": "Unilateral SLN palsy",

        "D": "Bilateral RLN palsy"
      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: B) Unilateral SLN palsy Explanation: In this scenario, the patient is a professional singer who reports difficulty with high-pitched sounds, which is a hallmark of unilateral SLN palsy . The external branch of the superior laryngeal nerve innervates the cricothyroid muscle , which tenses the vocal cords, crucial for producing high-pitched sounds. In unilateral SLN palsy, the patient does not experience breathing or swallowing difficulties, and laryngoscopic examination may appear normal. Unilateral SLN Palsy Motor Loss: Cricothyroid muscle - decreased ability to tense the vocal cord. Sensory Loss: Above the vocal cord on the affected side. Vocal Cord Position: The affected vocal cord appears shortened and wavy ; may exhibit flapping due to loss of tension. Other Features: Askew position of the glottis with the anterior commissure rotated towards the healthy side. Voice changes such as weakness and inability to raise pitch, affecting singing ability. Treatment: Primarily voice therapy to improve vocal function and manage symptoms. Bilateral SLN Palsy Motor Loss: Both cricothyroid muscles - bilateral loss of vocal cord tension. Sensory Loss: Above the vocal cords bilaterally. Vocal Cord Position: Both vocal cords may be shortened and lack tension , potentially leading to difficulties with voice production. Other Features: Inhalation of food and secretions resulting in coughing and choking . The voice is weak and husky . Treatment: Tracheostomy with a cuffed tube and esophageal feeding tube, if aspiration is severe. Epiglottopexy (reversible) - close laryngeal inlet - to protect the lungs from aspiration. Voice pitch improvement through surgical approximation of the thyroid and cricoid cartilages. Bilateral SLN palsy (Option A): The patient would have more pronounced symptoms, including a monotonous voice, significant difficulty with high-pitched sounds, and aspiration due to poor sensation in the upper larynx. Unilateral RLN palsy (Option C) Causes hoarseness and, on laryngoscopy, shows one vocal cord in a paramedian position . In contrast, this patient's difficulty is specifically related to high-pitched sounds , pointing to SLN involvement rather than RLN. Bilateral RLN palsy (Option D): It is a severe condition that typically results in stridor or significant respiratory difficulty due to both vocal cords being fixed in the paramedian position. The absence of breathing or swallowing problems in this patient rules out bilateral RLN palsy. Reference: Dhingra's Diseases Of Ear, Nose And Throat, & Head and Neck Surgery, 8th Edition, Page 350.",

      "question": "A 45-year-old female presents with hoarseness , shortness of breath and stridor following thyroid surgery. Laryngoscopy reveals bilateral vocal cord paralysis with both cords fixed in paramedian position. Which of the following is the most appropriate immediate management?",
      "options": {

      },
      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: A) Tracheostomy Explanation: This patient presents with symptoms and laryngoscopic findings consistent with bilateral recurrent laryngeal nerve (RLN) palsy, likely due to iatrogenic injury during thyroid surgery. In bilateral RLN palsy, both vocal cords are typically fixed in a paramedian or intermediate position, leading to a narrow airway . This can cause severe dyspnea and stridor , potentially life-threatening complications. The immediate priority in managing such cases is to secure the airway, which is best achieved through a tracheostomy . Recurrent laryngeal nerve (RLN) palsy can occur either unilaterally or bilaterally, leading to varying clinical manifestations and airway complications. Vocal cord lateralization (Option B): While this is a treatment option for bilateral RLN palsy, it is not the immediate management of choice. This procedure is typically considered after the airway is secured and the patient is stabilized. Arytenoidectomy (Option C): This is another surgical option for treating bilateral RLN palsy, but like vocal cord lateralization, it's not the immediate management of choice. This is usually considered at a later stage if other options fail. Observation and voice therapy (Option D): This approach is inadequate for bilateral RLN palsy with significant airway compromise. While voice therapy can be beneficial in the long-term management of RLN palsy, it does not address the immediate airway emergency presented in this scenario. References:",

      "explanation": "Correct Answer : B) Unilateral recurrent laryngeal nerve (RLN) paralysis Explanation : In unilateral RLN paralysis , the affected vocal cord typically rests in the paramedian position. The vocal cord is approximately 1.5 mm from the midline, and this position allows for a strong whisper but impaired phonation. Vocal cord positions in healthy and diseased states: Position of Vocal Cords Location from Midline Healthy State Diseased State Median Midline Phonation RLN paralysis Paramedian 1.5 mm Strong whisper Unilateral RLN paralysis Intermediate (Cadaveric) 3 mm — Paralysis of both RLN & SLN Gentle abduction 7 mm Quiet respiration Paralysis of adductors Full abduction 9 mm Deep respiration — Bilateral RLN paralysis (Option A) would result in both cords being at the median or paramedian position, leading to significant airway obstruction. SLN paralysis (Option C) would cause difficulty with pitch control but not affect the cord position this way. Paralysis of both RLN and SLN (Option D) would result in an intermediate (cadaveric) position, not paramedian.

        "D": "Thyrohyoid muscle"
      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: B) Lateral cricoarytenoid muscle Explanation: The lateral cricoarytenoid muscle is primarily responsible for adducting the vocal folds and closing the rima glottidis during phonation. It rotates the arytenoid cartilage internally, bringing the vocal processes and vocal folds together. Phonation: The process of sound production in the larynx as air passes through the vocal cords. During this process, the vocal cords or vocal folds adduct and vibrate as air from the lungs passes through the narrow space between them, the glottis. Various intrinsic laryngeal muscles regulate the tension, length, and position of the vocal cords: Posterior cricoarytenoid muscle : vocal cord abduction , facilitating the opening of the rima glottidis. (Option A) Lateral cricoarytenoid, interarytenoid, and thyroarytenoid muscles : adduct the vocal cords, resulting in the closure of the rima glottidis. (Option B) Cricothyroid and vocalis muscles : Increase tension in the vocal cords. Thyroepiglottic muscle : Opens the laryngeal inlet. (Option C) Aryepiglottic and oblique arytenoid muscles : Close the laryngeal inlet. Phonation depends on neural control through the following nerves: The recurrent laryngeal nerve - most of the intrinsic laryngeal muscles The superior laryngeal nerve - the cricothyroid muscle- is essential for modulating pitch. Thyrohyoid muscle (Option D): This is an extrinsic laryngeal muscle. It elevates the larynx and depresses the hyoid bone. While it plays a role in laryngeal positioning, it does not directly adduct the vocal folds.",
