      "question": "A 42 y/o woman with a history of nasal surgery presents with a depressed nasal bridge and difficulty breathing through her nose. Examination reveals a significant depression involving both the bony and cartilaginous parts of her nose. What would be the treatment approach for this patient?",
      "options": {
        "A": "A cartilage graft from the nasal septum",
        "B": "Cancellous bone graft from the iliac crest",
        "C": "Silicone implant",
        "D": "Observation without intervention"
      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Correct answer: B) Cancellous bone graft from the iliac crest Explanation: This presentation suggests saddle nose deformity , characterized by a depressed nasal bridge, often following trauma or previous nasal surgery. The goal of treatment is to restore the nasal structure and improve both the aesthetic appearance and airway function. When both the bony and cartilaginous structures of the nose are depressed, the best treatment involves using cancellous bone . This graft, often harvested from the iliac crest , provides structural support to restore the shape of the nose. If depression involves: Only cartilage : Cartilage is taken from the nasal septum or the auricle. Both Bone and Cartilage: Cancellous bone from the iliac crest is the best. Causes of Saddle Nose Deformity: Nasal trauma Excessive septum removal Septal damage due to septal hematoma or abscess. Conditions like leprosy, tuberculosis, or syphilis. I I A cartilage graft from the nasal septum (Option A) is used when only the cartilage of the nose is affected by the deformity. Silicone implant (Option C): Although synthetic materials like silicone can be used to fill the nasal dorsum, autologous grafts like bone are generally preferred due to lower risks of complications such as extrusion or rejection by the body. Observation without intervention (Option D): Leaving the deformity untreated, especially when it is causing functional issues like difficulty breathing, is not advisable.

      "question": "A 28 y/o woman presents with concerns about a prominent nasal hump. What is the primary treatment option for correction?",
      "options": {
        "A": "Reduction rhinoplasty",
        "B": "Augmentation rhinoplasty",
        "C": "Septoplasty",
        "D": "Nasal steroid therapy"
      },
      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "Correct answer: A) Reduction rhinoplasty Explanation: Hump nose deformity refers to a nasal profile with an excessive prominence along the dorsum (bridge) of the nose. It is often due to excess bone and cartilage. This condition is mainly cosmetic. Reduction rhinoplasty addresses the removal of the nasal hump by reshaping the nose. It involves exposing the nasal framework, removing the hump, and performing osteotomies to refine the shape and prevent widening. Fig: Saddle Nose deformity Augmentation rhinoplasty (Option B) is used to increase nasal height or fill a depression, such as in cases of a saddle nose deformity. It does not address the removal of a hump but instead enhances the nasal dorsum. Septoplasty (Option C): Septoplasty is primarily performed to correct a deviated nasal septum, improving airflow. While it may be part of rhinoplasty if nasal function is affected, it does not focus on removing a hump or reshaping the nasal dorsum. Nasal steroid therapy (Option D) is used to reduce inflammation in nasal conditions like allergic rhinitis. It does not address structural issues, such as a hump, and is not a solution for cosmetic nasal concerns.",

      "options": {
        "A": "Cryotherapy",

        "D": "Carbon dioxide laser ablation"
      },
      "correct_answer": "D",
      "explanation": "Correct answer: D) Carbon dioxide laser ablation Explanation: Rhinophyma (potato tumour) is a slow-growing, benign tumour characterized by enlarged sebaceous glands on the nose tip and is associated with long-standing acne rosacea. It presents as a pink, lumpy mass with visible blood vessels. Commonly seen in middle-aged and older men. Carbon dioxide laser ablation is used to precisely remove the excess tissue of rhinophyma. It is effective for reducing the tumour’s bulk with minimal scarring, making it an ideal choice for both cosmetic and functional concerns. Cryotherapy (Option A): Cryotherapy involves freezing the tissue to destroy it, but it is not typically used for rhinophyma. Surgical paring (Option B): Although surgical paring involves removing the tumour’s bulk with a sharp instrument, it may result in more noticeable scarring compared to laser ablation. It is a viable option but less preferred for minimizing cosmetic impact. Topical antibiotics (Option C): Topical antibiotics are used for treating infections, not for removing the benign tumour of rhinophyma.",

      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: B) Basal cell carcinoma Explanation: Basal cell carcinoma is the most common malignant tumour of the nasal skin, especially at sites like the tip or ala of the nose. It typically presents as a slow-growing ulcer with rolled edges, as described in the scenario. Type of malignancy Basal cell carcinoma Squamous cell carcinoma Features The most common malignant tumour of nasal skin (87%). Affects both males and females aged 40-60 years. Also known as Rodent ulcer Second most common nasal skin malignancy (11%). Affects both sexes aged 40-60 years. Also known as Epithelioma Causes It is caused by exposure to UV radiation. Occupational exposure to formaldehyde, chrome, nickel, arsenic and welding fumes. Common sites Tip and ala of the nose. Side of nose or columella. Clinical features Cyst, papulo-pearly nodule, or ulcer with rolled edges. Slow-growing, confined to skin for a long time, may invade cartilage or bone. Nodal metastases are extremely rare. Infiltrating nodule or ulcer with rolled-out edges. Nodal metastases occur in 20% of cases. Histopathology Treatment Early lesions: cryosurgery, irradiation, or surgical excision with a 3-5 mm healthy margin. Advanced/recurrent lesions: excision with local or distant flap or prosthesis repair. Moh’s surgery Early lesions: radiotherapy. Advanced lesions with cartilage/bone exposure: wide surgical excision and plastic repair. Regional lymph node involvement: block dissection. Squamous cell carcinoma (Option B) would more likely present on the side of the nose or columella and has a higher rate of nodal metastasis (20%), which is not observed here. Malignant melanoma (Option C) usually presents as a pigmented lesion, which was not mentioned. Sebaceous adenoma(Option D) is a benign lesion of sebaceous glands, less likely to present as an ulcerated lesion with rolled edges.",

      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Correct answer: C) Septal spur Explanation: The image shows a septal spur . Septal spur is associated with symptoms such as headaches and recurrent epistaxis, due to pressure and stretching of the vessels over the shelf-like projection at the bone-cartilage junction, fitting the patient’s presentation. Deviated Nasal Septum(DNS): A deviated septum occurs when your septum, the cartilage and bone that separates the nasal cavity, is off-centre. Etiology of Deviated Nasal Septum (DNS): Trauma: Lateral or frontal blows can cause displacement of the septum. Birth injuries during a difficult labour Developmental Errors: Unequal growth between the palate and skull base Seen in cleft lip and palate, adenoid hypertrophy or dental abnormalities Racial Factors: Caucasians> Black Familial inheritance.

      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Correct answer: C) DNS can cause anosmia. Explanation: DNS can block airflow to the olfactory region, resulting in a loss of smell. Clinical Features of Deviated Nasal Septum (DNS) Nasal Obstruction Unilateral or bilateral obstruction, more severe in high septal deviations (Option A ruled out) . Obstruction sites can include vestibular, nasal valves, attic, turbinal, or choanal regions. Cottle Test : Positive if the airway improves when the cheek is pulled laterally (indicates nasal valve abnormality). (Option D ruled out) Headache Pressure from septal spurs against the lateral wall of the nose causes a pressure-type headache (Option B ruled out) Sinusitis DNS can block sinus ostia, leading to poor ventilation and a predisposition to sinus infections. Epistaxis Drying and crust formation over the deviated septum can cause bleeding upon removal of crusts. Bleeding can also occur from vessels on septal spurs. Anosmia Partial or total loss of smell due to failure of air to reach the olfactory region. External Deformity Visible nasal deformities such as deviation of the nasal dorsum or deformities of the nasal tip or columella. Middle Ear Infection DNS predisposes to middle ear infections due to poor ventilation through the Eustachian tube.",

        "D": "SMR is preferred for safer reoperation and anterior deviations."
      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "children. Correct Answer: B) Septoplasty is preferred for limited dissection, with no impact on nasal growth in children. Explanation: Septoplasty is a conservative approach suitable for children, involves minimal dissection, and does not interfere with growth. Cottle’s line A vertical line between the nasal processes of the frontal and maxillary bones. The surgical approach depends on the deviation's location relative to Cottle's line: Anterior to Cottle's line: Septoplasty is preferred. (Option D ruled out) Posterior to Cottle's line: Submucous resection (SMR) is preferred. Feature Submucous Resection Septoplasty Extent of Dissection Extensive dissection, removing all deformed bony and cartilaginous parts, preserving only a caudal and dorsal strut. Limited, selective dissection, removing minimal cartilage and bone, preserving most of the framework. (Option C ruled out) Age Consideration Not performed before 17 years to avoid interference with nasal growth. (Option A ruled out) Can be performed in children without affecting nasal growth. Flap Elevation Flaps are raised on both sides of the septum. Flap raised on one side with limited elevation on the opposite side Treatment of Deformed Parts Bony and cartilaginous parts are excised. Deformed cartilage is corrected by scoring, cross-hatching, wedge excision, or realigning after external correction (extracorporeal septoplasty). Risk of Complications Higher chances of complications (e.g., supra tip depression, columellar recession, flapping of septum). Lower chances of complications. Reoperation Reoperation is difficult. Reoperation is easier.",

        "D": "Incision and drainage, followed by nasal packing."
      },
      "correct_answer": "D",
      "explanation": "Correct answer: D) Incision and drainage, followed by nasal packing. Explanation: In the scenario presented, the patient exhibits signs of a septal hematoma following nasal trauma, including bilateral nasal obstruction, frontal headache, and a soft, fluctuant swelling in the nasal cavities. The appropriate management for a septal hematoma involves incision and drainage for proper management, followed by nasal packing to prevent reaccumulation. Septal Hematoma Aetiology Collection of blood under the perichondrium or periosteum of the nasal septum. Commonly caused by: Nasal trauma. Septal surgery. Spontaneous occurrence in bleeding disorders. Clinical features Bilateral nasal obstruction (most common symptom). Fontal headache and pressure over the nasal bridge. Smooth, rounded, soft, and fluctuant swelling in both nasal fossae (or sometimes unilateral). Treatment Small hematomas: Aspirated with a wide-bore sterile needle. Larger hematomas: Incision and drainage via a septal incision parallel to the nasal floor, excising a small piece of mucosa for better drainage. Nasal packing on both sides to prevent reaccumulation. Systemic antibiotics to prevent septal abscess. Complications Fibrous tissue formation leads to permanent septal thickening if untreated. Secondary infection may lead to septal abscess, cartilage necrosis, and nasal dorsum depression. Nasal packing (Option A) : Nasal packing alone is not sufficient for managing larger septal hematomas, which typically require incision and drainage. Use cryotherapy to manage nasal swelling without drainage(Option B): Cryotherapy is not appropriate for treating septal hematomas; proper drainage is required to resolve the condition. Use of systemic antibiotics without drainage(Option C) : Systemic antibiotics are important to prevent infection, but they do not replace the need for drainage in larger hematomas.",

        "D": "Corticosteroid therapy"
      },
      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "Correct answer: A) Immediate drainage Explanation: The clinical features point to a Septal Abscess. When left untreated, septal abscesses can lead to serious complications like necrosis of the septal cartilage, septal perforation, and even life-threatening conditions such as meningitis or cavernous sinus thrombosis. Immediate surgical drainage of the abscess is necessary to remove the pus collection and prevent these severe outcomes. Antibiotic therapy should also be started after drainage. Fig: Septal Abscess Observation and follow-up in a week (Option B): This would be inappropriate for managing a septal abscess, as delaying treatment worsens infection, leading to significant complications. Nasal decongestants (Option C): Although decongestants might provide temporary relief from nasal obstruction, they do not treat the underlying infection or address the collection of pus within the septum. Corticosteroid therapy (Option D): Corticosteroids are used to reduce inflammation in many conditions, but in the case of a septal abscess, the issue is infection. Corticosteroids would not resolve the abscess and could worsen it by suppressing the immune response.",

        "D": "Application of saline nasal washes and insertion of septal button"
      },
      "correct_answer": "D",
      "explanation": "Correct answer: D) Application of saline nasal washes and insertion of septal button Explanation: The initial management of a large nasal septal perforation focuses on alleviating symptoms, such as crusting, obstruction, and irritation, while preventing further damage. Saline nasal washes help keep the nasal cavity clean and free from crusting. A silastic sheet or septal button is a prosthetic device inserted into the perforation to physically seal it. This improves airflow, reduces crusting, and minimizes irritation, significantly enhancing the patient's comfort. Fig: Septal Perforation Etiology: Bony perforations: Caused by syphilis or other conditions affecting the bony septum. Cartilaginous perforations: Commonly result from trauma, tuberculosis, or septal abscess. Total perforations: Can occur in systemic diseases like Wegener’s granulomatosis. Surgical closure with plastic flaps (Option A): This is reserved for small, inactive perforations where the hole in the septum can be closed surgically using plastic flaps. However, for larger perforations, closure can be challenging and is not the first-line treatment. Cauterization of the perforation (Option B): Cauterization involves burning tissue and is used to stop nosebleeds or other issues, but it is not a recommended treatment for septal perforations. Use of steroid nasal sprays (Option C): While nasal sprays are commonly used to treat allergies and reduce inflammation, they can also contribute to septal perforations, especially when used long-term. Therefore, this is not an appropriate treatment and may exacerbate the issue rather than help manage it.",
