It supplies the posterior part of the nasal cavity, including the posterior nasal septum and lateral walls. Total Blood Supply to the Nasal Cavity: External Carotid Artery System: Sphenopalatine Artery( AKA artery of Epistaxis ) : A terminal branch of the maxillary artery supplying the nasal septum and lateral nasal wall. Greater Palatine Artery : A branch of the maxillary artery contributes to the supply of the hard palate and lower part of the nasal septum. Superior Labial Artery : A branch of the facial artery supplies the anterior nasal septum, particularly Little’s area. Internal Carotid Artery System: Anterior Ethmoidal Artery : A branch of the ophthalmic artery that supplies the anterior and superior nasal cavity. Posterior Ethmoidal Artery is also a branch of the ophthalmic artery; it supplies the upper posterior portion of the nasal cavity.",

      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: A) Kiesselbach’s plexus Explanation: Kiesselbach’s plexus, also known as Little's area , is a highly vascularised region in the anteroinferior portion of the nasal septum , where multiple arteries converge. It is the most common site of anterior epistaxis , especially in children and young adults. Vessels involved in forming the plexus: Artery Branch of Sphenopalatine artery Maxillary artery Anterior ethmoidal artery Ophthalmic artery (from internal carotid artery) Greater palatine artery Maxillary artery Superior labial artery Facial artery (from external carotid artery) Note: The posterior ethmoidal artery is not part of this plexus Clinical Significance: Anterior epistaxis occurs most often in children and young adults, usually due to trauma (nose-picking), dry air, infections, or irritants. Epistaxis in this area is typically mild and self-limiting and can be controlled with local pressure or simple cauterization. Woodruff’s plexus (Option B) is a venous plexus located on the posterior lateral wall of the nasal cavity, particularly in the inferior nasal meatus. It is often involved in cases of posterior epistaxis. Its primary arterial contributors are the sphenopalatine artery, ascending pharyngeal artery, and posterior nasal branches of the sphenopalatine artery. Pterygoid plexus (Option C) is a venous plexus located in the infratemporal fossa behind the maxilla. It is primarily involved in draining blood from the face and orbit. Cavernous sinus (Option D) is a large venous sinus located at the base of the skull on either side of the pituitary gland. It is not involved in epistaxis but drains blood from the brain and orbits.",

        "D": "TESPAL"
      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: B) Cauterize with silver nitrate Explanation: If a bleeding point is identified in the anterior epistaxis that persists despite initial first aid measures, cauterization with silver nitrate is the most appropriate next step. Embolization and TESPAL (Temporal Endoscopic Surgery for Posterior Anterior Ligament) are reserved for more severe or posterior bleeding. Management of Epistaxis: First Line: (Direct therapy) First Aid: Hippocrates method : Pinch the nose with the thumb and index finger for about 5 minutes to control bleeding, especially from Little’s area. Trotter’s Method : Have the patient sit forward over a basin to spit blood and breathe through the mouth. Apply cold compresses to induce vasoconstriction. Cauterization: Indication : Effective for anterior epistaxis when the bleeding point is identified . Apply topical anaesthesia and cauterize with silver nitrate or electrocautery. Second Line: (Indirect therapy) Anterior Nasal Packing: Clear the nasal cavity of blood clots, localise the bleeding site, and pack with ribbon gauze soaked in liquid paraffin. The packing may need to stay for 24-72 hours with systemic antibiotics to prevent infection. Posterior Nasal Packing: Use a cone-shaped gauze pack and a rubber catheter or nasal balloon. The pack is guided into the nasopharynx, with an anterior nasal pack to stabilize. Patients need to be hospitalised & balloons with separate bulbs for the postnasal space and nasal cavity are used. Third Line: (Surgical Interventions ) Ligation of Vessels : Maxillary Artery : Ligation via Caldwell-Luc operation for uncontrollable posterior epistaxis. Ethmoidal Arteries : for bleeding from above the middle turbinate. External Carotid : Ligate above the superior thyroid artery for persistent bleeding from the external carotid system. Transnasal Endoscopic Sphenopalatine Artery Ligation (TESPAL) : Locate and ligate the Sphenopalatine artery (Artery of Epistaxis) to control refractory posterior bleeding. (Option D) Fourth Line (Embolization ) (Option C) Performed by an interventional radiologist through femoral artery catheterisation using absorbable gel foam or coils. It may require bilateral embolisation for unilateral bleeding. Note: The order of ligation is 1. sphenopalatine 2. maxillary 3. ethmoid/ECA Anterior nasal packing (Option A) is a first-line treatment for persistent anterior epistaxis. However, if a specific bleeding point is identified and persists, cauterisation is more effective than packing.

      "explanation": "Correct Answer: A) Lynch-Howarth incision Explanation: The Lynch-Howarth incision is the most appropriate for accessing the medial wall of the orbit to ligate the anterior ethmoidal artery. The incision is made along the medial canthus of the eye, extending along the inner corner of the eyelid. It allows direct access to this area where the artery can be effectively controlled. Advantages: Direct Access & Minimally invasive. Fig: Lynch-Howarth incision Sublabial Incision (Option B) is typically used to access the maxillary sinus and palatal areas, but it is unsuitable for reaching the anterior ethmoidal artery. Weber-Ferguson Incision (Option D) is a broader incision used for extensive access to the nasal cavity and maxilla, but not specifically for the anterior ethmoidal artery. Gullwing Incision (Option C) is not commonly used in ENT procedures and is primarily used for cosmetic or reconstructive procedures involving the eyelids or facial skin.",

Hereditary Hemorrhagic Telangiectasia (HHT) : (Osler-Weber-Rendu disease) An autosomal dominant condition characterised by abnormal blood vessels in the skin, mucous membranes, and internal organs. Clinical Features : Common symptoms include telangiectasia, arteriovenous malformations (AVMs), and aneurysms. Recurrent epistaxis (nosebleeds) occurs in 93% of cases. Management: Initial Treatments : Nasal packing (Option B) , cautery, antifibrinolytics, systemic or topical estrogens. Advanced Treatments : Coagulative lasers ( Nd , Argon, KTP532) (Option C) , septal dermoplasty (Option A) , ligation, and embolization. Last Resort : Young's operation, involving permanent surgical closure of the nostrils, is used for severe, persistent bleeding. Despite the significant disability it may cause, it often improves quality of life by reducing bleeding.

        "D": "Nasal packing and observation"
      },
      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: C) Closed reduction after edema subsides Explanation: Closed reduction after oedema subsides is the preferred approach as it is both effective and less invasive than open reduction. Edema can interfere with accurate closed reduction (Option A ruled out) . It is best to wait until swelling subsides, typically 5-7 days, before performing closed reduction. Management of Nasal Fractures: Diagnosis Physical Examination is the best method for diagnosing nasal fractures. Look for signs such as swelling, periorbital ecchymosis, tenderness, nasal deformity, crepitus, epistaxis, and nasal obstruction. X-rays : These may not always reveal fractures. Necessary views include Waters’ view, lateral views, and occlusal view. Treatment Simple Fractures : Generally, no treatment is required if there's no displacement. Monitor for natural healing. Closed Reduction : Timing : Ideally performed before significant edema develops or after it subsides (Option C) (usually 5-7 days). Technique : Use a straight blunt elevator guided by digital manipulation from outside for depressed fractures. Reduce laterally displaced nasal bridge with firm digital pressure in the opposite direction. Disimpaction of impacted fragments requires Walsham or Asch’s forceps. Septal fractures and hematomas should be managed with Asch’s forceps. Packing : Unstable fractures require intranasal packing and external splintage. Open Reduction (Option B): Rarely required early & Considered if closed methods fail, for certain septal injuries & if a patient presents late. Correction of Deformities : May need rhinoplasty or septorhinoplasty for healed deformities from trauma. Nasal packing and observation (Option D) may help manage bleeding or minor fractures but does not address the alignment of the fractured bones.
