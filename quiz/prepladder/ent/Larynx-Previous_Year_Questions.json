      "correct_answer": "D",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: D) Prevertebral Abscess Explanation: Laryngeal crepitus refers to the movement of the larynx over the cervical spine during swallowing. It is absent when the larynx is fixed due to an underlying pathology. In a prevertebral abscess , infection spreads in the prevertebral space , restricting the mobility of the larynx, thus abolishing crepitus. Laryngeal Crepitus and Its Absence Condition Laryngeal Crepitus Presence Reason Post-cricoid malignancy Present (unless advanced) Tumors in this area usually do not fix the larynx early Hypopharyngeal abscess Present or reduced May affect laryngeal movement but not always abolish crepitus Parapharyngeal abscess Present or reduced Can restrict lateral movement but does not fix larynx completely Prevertebral abscess Absent Fixes the larynx to the spine, preventing movement Incorrect Options: Post-cricoid malignancy (Option A): is incorrect because early-stage malignancies do not fix the larynx. Crepitus is lost only in advanced cases where the tumor invades deeper tissues. Hypopharyngeal abscess (Option B): is incorrect because while it can partially restrict laryngeal movement, crepitus is not always completely absent unless the abscess is large. Parapharyngeal abscess (Option C): is incorrect because this abscess is lateral to the larynx and does not always cause fixation. However, extensive cases may restrict movement.

      "options": {
        "A": "Internal laryngeal nerve",

        "C": "External laryngeal nerve",
        "D": "Recurrent laryngeal nerve"
      },
      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "branch of the superior laryngeal nerve, which is, in turn, a branch of the vagus nerve. It supplies the laryngeal mucosa above the vocal cords and prevents aspiration of any foreign substances by protective cough reflex. Alcohol ingestion can cause alcohol-induced inhibition of the Central Nervous System, which can affect the internal laryngeal nerve, resulting in reduced laryngeal sensations and masked laryngeal reflexes. The larynx receives both motor and sensory nerve supply from branches of the vagus nerve. Motor innervation : Recurrent laryngeal nerve - All muscles that move the vocal cords, including abductors, adductors, and tensors. Except the cricothyroid muscle. External branch of the superior laryngeal nerve - cricothyroid muscle. (Option C ruled out) Sensory innervation : The internal branch of the superior laryngeal nerve - above the vocal cords. (Option A) Recurrent laryngeal nerve - below the vocal cords. Recurrent laryngeal nerve anatomy : (Option D ruled out) The right recurrent laryngeal nerve branches from the vagus at the level of the subclavian artery, looping around it before ascending between the trachea and esophagus. The left recurrent laryngeal nerve arises at the arch of the aorta, loops around it, and ascends along the tracheoesophageal groove, giving it a longer course compared to the right nerve, making it more prone to injury. Superior laryngeal nerve : Origin - from the inferior ganglion of the vagus nerve; courses behind the internal carotid artery; divides into external and internal branches at the level of the greater cornua of the hyoid bone. The external branch innervates the cricothyroid muscle. The internal branch provides sensory innervation to the larynx and hypopharynx after piercing through the thyrohyoid membrane. Glossopharyngeal nerve (CN IX): This nerve provides sensory innervation to the posterior third of the tongue, pharynx, and tonsils. While it contributes to the gag reflex and has some role in swallowing, it's not the primary nerve responsible for sensation in the supraglottic larynx that triggers the cough reflex.",

        "B": "Gelfoam injection",
        "C": "Thyroplasty type 1",
        "D": "Fat injection"
      },
      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: C) Thyroplasty type 1 Explanation: In a patient with diphtheria and right vocal fold palsy, thyroplasty type 1 is the most appropriate treatment. Thyroplasty type 1 is a surgical procedure used to improve vocal fold closure in cases of vocal fold paralysis. This procedure involves the insertion of an implant to push the paralyzed vocal fold towards the midline, improving voice quality and airway protection. It is especially helpful in cases of vocal fold paralysis caused by infections like diphtheria, which can result in nerve damage affecting vocal fold movement. Incorrect Options: Wait and watch (Option A) : Waiting and watching may be appropriate in some cases of vocal fold paralysis that resolve spontaneously over time. However, given that the patient has vocal fold palsy with potential functional impairment (speech and airway protection), active intervention such as thyroplasty is typically preferred to improve outcomes. Gelfoam injection (Option B) : Gelfoam injection is sometimes used in laryngeal procedures for temporary volume augmentation, but it is not the definitive treatment for vocal fold paralysis. It may not provide long-term results compared to thyroplasty. Fat injection (Option D) : Fat injection, similar to Gelfoam, is another method for increasing vocal fold bulk and improving closure, but it is less commonly used for permanent correction compared to thyroplasty. Fat injections can lead to resorption over time, reducing their long-term efficacy. Reference: Diseases of Ear, Nose, Throat - PL Dhingra, 8th edition, Page 350, 351",

      "question": "Which of the subsequent laryngeal cartilages is least prone to calcification?",
      "options": {
        "A": "Thyroid",
        "B": "Cricoid",
        "C": "Arytenoid",
        "D": "Epiglottis"
      },
      "correct_answer": "D",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: D) Epiglottis Explanation: Epiglottis is least prone to calcification because it is composed of elastic cartilage , which resists calcification compared to hyaline cartilage. Elastic cartilage maintains its flexibility and does not undergo the age-related ossification seen in other laryngeal cartilages. Type of Cartilage Paired Cartilage Unpaired Cartilage Hyaline Cartilage (Calcifies with age) Arytenoid Thyroid, Cricoid Elastic Cartilage Corniculate, Cuneiform Epiglottis Epiglottis Unpaired Elastic Cartilage Shape: Leaf-shaped yellow elastic cartilage. Location: Forms the anterior wall of the laryngeal inlet. Attachments: Connected to the hyoid bone by the hyoepiglottic ligament , dividing it into suprahyoid and infrahyoid portions. The petiole attaches it to the thyroid cartilage just above the vocal cords. Anterior Surface: Preepiglottic Space: Located in front of the epiglottis, between the anterior surface and the thyrohyoid membrane/upper thyroid cartilage. Filled with fat, it may be involved in supraglottic cancers or the base of tongue carcinomas. Posterior Surface: Tubercle of Epiglottis: A bulge that may obstruct the view of the anterior commissure during indirect laryngoscopy. Contains pits for mucous glands and occasional perforations, which may facilitate cancer spread to the preepiglottic space. Clinical Significance: Cancer Spread: Supraglottic cancers can invade the pre-epiglottic space through epiglottic perforations. Non-Essential for Swallowing: The epiglottis can be safely amputated in cases of cancer or trauma without significant risk of aspiration. Thyroid (Option A) : The thyroid cartilage is made of hyaline cartilage , which tends to calcify with age, especially after the third decade of life. Cricoid (Option B) : Like the thyroid cartilage, the cricoid cartilage is also composed of hyaline cartilage and is prone to calcification as part of the normal ageing process. Arytenoid (Option C) : The arytenoid cartilage consists of hyaline cartilage in its base and elastic cartilage in its apex, but the hyaline portion is susceptible to calcification over time.",

      "question": "Which of the following is not employed in post-laryngectomy rehabilitation?",
      "options": {
        "A": "Tracheoesophageal prosthesis",
        "B": "Esophageal speech",
        "C": "Super supraglottic swallow",
        "D": "Polite yawning"
      },
      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "anatomical structures it targets (vocal folds) are no longer present. Vocal rehabilitation-methods: After laryngectomy, the patient loses his speech completely. The various methods by which communication can be established are given below: Oesophageal Speech (Option B ruled out) In this, the patient is taught to swallow air and hold it in the upper esophagus and then slowly eject it from the esophagus into the pharynx. The patient can speak 6-10 words before re-swallowing air. The voice is rough but loud and understandable. Artificial Larynx It is used in those who fail to learn oesophageal speech. 1. Electrolarynx: Its vibrating disc is held against the soft tissues of the neck and a low-pitched sound is produced in the hypopharynx which is further modulated into speech by the tongue, lips, teeth, and palate. 2. Transoral pneumatic device It is a transoral device. Here vibrations produced in a rubber diaphragm are carried by a plastic tube into the back of the oral cavity where sound is converted into speech by modulators. This is a pneumatic type of device and uses expired air from the tracheostome to vibrate the diaphragm. Tracheo-Oesophageal Speech (Option A ruled out) Here an attempt is made to carry air from the trachea to the esophagus or hypopharynx by the creation of a skin-lined fistula or by placement of an artificial prosthesis. The vibrating column of air entering the pharynx is then modulated into speech. This technique has the disadvantage of food entering the trachea. These days prostheses (Blom-Singer or Panje) are being used to shunt air from the trachea to the esophagus They have inbuilt valves which work only in one direction thus preventing problems of aspiration. Olfactory Rehabilitation: (Option D ruled out) After laryngectomy, smell is lost because air no longer passes through the nose. This also means patients can't detect dangerous environmental odours like smoke or gas. To address this, a technique called \"polite yawning\" can be taught. This involves: Lowering the jaw, floor of mouth, and tongue while keeping lips closed. This creates negative pressure in the mouth and throat, drawing air through the nose. Repeating this maneuver several times can help restore some sense of smell and allow detection of environmental hazards.",

        "D": "Tympanoplasty"
      },
      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer A - Subglottic stenosis Mitomycin-C is an antineoplastic antibiotic that acts as a DNA cross-linking agent and is used topically in various medical and surgical conditions to inhibit fibroblast proliferation and scar formation . In ENT practice, it is commonly used in the treatment of subglottic stenosis to prevent restenosis following airway dilation or surgical intervention. It is applied topically to the affected area after dilation or surgical removal of fibrotic tissue to reduce the risk of recurrence by inhibiting fibroblast proliferation and excessive scarring. Rhinocerebral mucormycosis (Option B): Incorrect because the treatment of rhinocerebral mucormycosis primarily involves amphotericin B and surgical debridement , not Mitomycin-C. Adenoidectomy (Option C): Incorrect because Mitomycin-C is not used in routine adenoidectomy . The procedure involves surgical removal of hypertrophied adenoid tissue without the need for an antifibrotic agent. Tympanoplasty (Option D): Incorrect because Mitomycin-C is not used in tympanoplasty . This procedure aims to repair the tympanic membrane and ossicular chain, and there is no role for an antifibrotic agent.

      "options": {
        "A": "Tracheoesophageal prosthesis",
        "B": "Chicago implant",
        "C": "Electro larynx",
        "D": "Esophageal speech"
      },
      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "an electro larynx for voice production. It is a handheld device that vibrates to generate sound, which the patient then shapes into speech by moving their mouth. The electro larynx is an effective alternative for patients who cannot use a tracheoesophageal prosthesis and provides a mechanical, yet functional, voice. Electro Larynx: The electro larynx is commonly used in patients who have undergone a total laryngectomy , a procedure that removes the larynx and disrupts normal voice production. The device works by emitting vibrations, which the patient can articulate to form words. Although it can be mechanical-sounding, it remains a popular and accessible method for speech restoration. Incorrect Options: Tracheoesophageal prosthesis (Option A): is incorrect because it involves the use of a small valve between the trachea and esophagus to produce speech, not a mechanical device. Chicago implant (Option B): is incorrect because the Chicago implant is a type of prosthesis used for tracheoesophageal speech but does not directly generate sound like the electro larynx. Esophageal speech (Option D): is incorrect because this method involves swallowing air and releasing it from the esophagus to produce speech, which is different from using a mechanical device like the electro larynx.

      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer A - Acute laryngotracheobronchitis: Acute laryngotracheobronchitis (Croup): The \"steeple sign\" seen on the X-ray is characteristic of acute laryngotracheobronchitis, commonly known as croup. This sign refers to the narrowing of the subglottic airway, which appears as a \"steeple\" or \"church steeple\" shape on the frontal view of the X-ray. Croup typically presents with symptoms such as a barking cough, stridor, and respiratory distress in children. Acute Laryngotracheobronchitis (Croup): Acute laryngotracheobronchitis, or croup, is a viral infection most commonly caused by parainfluenza viruses, although other viruses like RSV can also cause it. It leads to inflammation and swelling of the larynx, trachea, and bronchi, which results in airway narrowing and the characteristic \"barking\" cough. The \"steeple sign\" seen on X-ray is a diagnostic clue, reflecting subglottic narrowing, which is a hallmark of the disease. Diagnosis and Treatment of Acute Epiglottitis vs. Croup Aspect Acute Epiglottitis Croup (Acute Laryngotracheobronchitis) Diagnosis Visualisation: Red and swollen epiglottis (avoid indirect laryngoscopy to prevent airway obstruction). Lateral Neck X-ray: \"Thumb sign\" indicating swollen epiglottis. Differentiated based on clinical features (e.g., absence of drooling, voice quality). The \"steeple sign\" on an X-ray AP view shows a narrowing of the upper airway, often seen in croup. X-Ray",

      },
      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer C - Bilateral recurrent laryngeal nerve injury A patient experiencing breathing difficulties and unsuccessful extubation after a total thyroidectomy strongly suggests bilateral recurrent laryngeal nerve (RLN) injury . The recurrent laryngeal nerves supply motor innervation to all intrinsic laryngeal muscles (except the cricothyroid). Bilateral injury causes bilateral vocal cord paralysis in a paramedian position , leading to airway obstruction , stridor , and inability to extubate due to compromised glottic airway. Superior laryngeal nerve injury (Option A): Incorrect because this nerve supplies the cricothyroid muscle , affecting voice modulation and pitch , but does not cause airway obstruction . Unilateral recurrent laryngeal nerve injury (Option B): Incorrect because unilateral RLN injury leads to hoarseness , not significant respiratory distress or extubation failure . The contralateral vocal cord compensates , allowing adequate breathing. Hematoma (Option D): Incorrect because while a postoperative neck hematoma can cause airway compression , it typically presents with swelling, bruising, and respiratory distress within a few hours postoperatively. Immediate surgical evacuation would relieve symptoms, unlike bilateral RLN injury , which persists despite hematoma evacuation.

TNM Staging of Hypopharyngeal Cancer (Including Pyriform Fossa) Stage Tumor Size/Extent Vocal Cord Mobility Lymph Node Involvement Metastasis T1 Tumor confined to one subsite of hypopharynx Normal No nodes (N0) No (M0) T2 Tumor extends to more than one subsite or adjacent areas Normal N0 M0 T3 Tumor >4 cm or vocal cord fixation Fixed N0 M0 T4a Tumor invades adjacent structures (e.g., thyroid/cricoid cartilage, hyoid, thyroid gland, esophagus) Fixed N0/N+ M0 T4b Tumor invades prevertebral fascia, encases carotid artery, or involves mediastinal structures Fixed N0/N+ M0 Incorrect Options: T2N0M0 (Option A): is incorrect because T2 is for tumors extending to multiple subsites but <4 cm and without vocal cord fixation . T4aN0M0 (Option C): is incorrect because T4a requires invasion into adjacent structures (e.g., cartilage, esophagus), which is not mentioned in this case . T4bN0M0 (Option D): is incorrect because T4b involves invasion of prevertebral fascia, carotid artery, or mediastinum, none of which are present in this case .

      "explanation": "Correct Answer: D) Laryngomalacia Explanation: Laryngomalacia is the most common cause of congenital stridor , presenting in infants with inspiratory stridor that worsens when supine or feeding . Laryngeal examination typically shows an omega-shaped epiglottis and redundant arytenoid mucosa , which collapse during inspiration. Laryngomalacia Feature Description Cause Congenital floppy laryngeal cartilage , especially affecting the epiglottis and arytenoids Symptoms Inspiratory stridor (worse when supine, feeding, or crying) Onset At birth or within the first few weeks of life , peaks at 4–8 months , resolves by 12–24 months Diagnosis Flexible laryngoscopy → shows omega-shaped epiglottis , redundant arytenoid mucosa Treatment Observation in mild cases, surgical intervention (supraglottoplasty) in severe cases Incorrect Options: Vocal cord paralysis (Option A): is incorrect because it causes biphasic stridor (both inspiratory and expiratory) and weak cry , unlike the isolated inspiratory stridor seen in laryngomalacia. Subglottic stenosis (Option B): is incorrect because it causes biphasic stridor and is often associated with prolonged intubation history . Laryngeal papilloma (Option C): is incorrect because it causes progressive hoarseness and voice changes , whereas laryngomalacia primarily causes stridor without voice involvement.",

      "question": "A patient presents with hoarseness of voice. On examination an ulceroproliferative mass is seen on the right vocal cord; the cord was however mobile. There is no lymph node involvement and no metastasis. Which of the following is the best treatment modality for this patient?",
      "options": {
        "A": "Total laryngectomy",
        "B": "Radiotherapy",
        "C": "Conservative laryngectomy",
        "D": "Chemotherapy"
      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: B) Radiotherapy Explanation: In this case, the patient presents with an ulceroproliferative mass on the right vocal cord with mobile vocal cords , no lymph node involvement , and no metastasis . This suggests an early-stage laryngeal carcinoma (likely T1 or T2 ), where the tumor is confined to the vocal cord without spread to adjacent tissues or lymph nodes. For early-stage tumors of the larynx, radiotherapy is the treatment of choice. It is effective in treating such localized tumors, helps preserve voice function, and avoids the need for more invasive procedures like surgery. Laryngeal Cancer Treatment: Laryngeal cancer typically presents with hoarseness , which may be the initial symptom. When a tumor is localized to the vocal cords (as in this case), and there is no evidence of regional lymph node involvement or distant metastasis , radiotherapy offers an effective non-surgical option. It preserves the vocal cords and the patient's voice function, making it the preferred treatment modality for early-stage cancers. In advanced laryngeal cancers (involving surrounding structures or metastasis), more radical treatments like total laryngectomy or chemotherapy may be necessary, but this is not the case here. Incorrect Options: Total laryngectomy (Option A): is incorrect because the tumor appears to be in an early, localized stage, and radiotherapy should be preferred for such cases to preserve the larynx and voice. Conservative laryngectomy (Option C): is incorrect because while partial laryngectomy may be considered for certain cases, radiotherapy is typically the first-line treatment for early-stage vocal cord cancer with no spread. Chemotherapy (Option D): is incorrect because chemotherapy is generally reserved for advanced or metastatic cancers , which is not the case in this patient, as there is no evidence of metastasis or lymph node involvement.

      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: B) Laryngocele Explanation: The most likely diagnosis is Laryngocele . A laryngocele is an air-filled dilation of the saccule of the larynx, which can communicate with the laryngeal lumen. The gurgling sound when compressing the swelling suggests the presence of air or fluid within the sac. This condition is often associated with activities that increase intra-abdominal or intrathoracic pressure, such as blowing a trumpet or playing other wind instruments. The CT scan would reveal a characteristic air-filled structure adjacent to the larynx, confirming the diagnosis. Laryngocele: A laryngocele is a condition where a portion of the laryngeal mucosa becomes dilated, typically due to increased pressure, causing an air-filled sac to form. It can be classified into internal (confined within the larynx) or external (extending outside the larynx into the neck). Laryngoceles are commonly seen in individuals who perform activities that involve frequent increases in intrathoracic or abdominal pressure, such as trumpet players or other wind instrument musicians. The clinical presentation may include a neck",

      "explanation": "entire larynx is removed. This procedure is typically performed in advanced laryngeal cancer cases that have not responded to other treatments, such as radiation therapy or chemotherapy. During a total laryngectomy, the trachea is re-routed to the front of the neck to create an opening called a stoma, which serves as the new airway. This procedure has significant implications for speech and swallowing, and patients typically require extensive rehabilitation to learn new communication and eating methods Indications for total laryngectomy: T4a with thyroid cartilage invasion. Stage 3 and 4a who cannot tolerate chemotherapy. Stage 3 and 4 recurrent tumours Bilateral arytenoid involvement. Incorrect Options: Partial laryngectomy (Option A): A partial laryngectomy is a surgical procedure in which only a part of the larynx is removed, leaving the rest of the organ intact. Percutaneous tracheostomy (Option B): Percutaneous tracheostomy is a minimally invasive procedure where a tube is inserted into the trachea via a small neck incision. It's commonly used for temporary or permanent airway support in conditions like obstructive sleep apnea or chronic respiratory failure, but it's not suitable for treating laryngeal cancer. Standard tracheostomy (Option C): A standard tracheostomy involves creating a neck incision to access the trachea, commonly used for temporary or permanent airway support in breathing difficulties. However, it's typically avoided in laryngeal cancer cases as it doesn't address the cancerous tissue in the larynx",

      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: A) Diplophonia Explanation: Diplophonia is a classic symptom of Reinke's edema. Diplophonia, also known as \"double voice,\" is a medical condition that causes a person to produce two simultaneous vocal sounds when speaking. This is usually caused by an abnormal vibration of the vocal cords, which results in a \"shaky\" or \"quivering\" voice that sounds like two voices speaking at once. Reinke's Edema Causes : Chronic vocal cord irritation (voice misuse, heavy smoking). Aka smokers larynx Chronic sinusitis, laryngopharyngeal reflux. Myxoedema More common in middle-aged men and women. Clinical Features : Hoarseness or husky voice. Use of false vocal cords for voice production, leading to a low-pitched, rough voice. Diplophonia Examination : Laryngoscopy: Fusiform swelling of vocal cords with a pale, translucent appearance. Ventricular bands may be hyperaemic and hypertrophic, obscuring true cords. Treatment : Decortication of vocal cords : Removal of a strip of epithelium, first on one side, then the other after 3-4 weeks. Voice rest Speech therapy : To improve proper voice production. Dysphonia (Option B): refers to any alteration in the voice, and while it may be present in patients with Reinke's edema, it is not a specific or classic symptom. Dysphagia of liquids or solids (Option C): is not a symptom associated with Reinke's edema, Dysphagia of liquids or solids (Option D): is not a symptom associated with Reinke's edema",

      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: C) Vocal nodule Explanation: The most likely diagnosis in a patient who is a teacher and presents with hoarseness of voice is vocal nodule. This is because vocal nodules are the most common benign vocal fold lesions in individuals who use their voice extensively, such as teachers, singers, and actors. Vocal nodules are caused by vocal abuse or misuse, resulting in repeated trauma to the vocal folds, leading to the formation of small, benign growths. Symptoms of vocal nodules include hoarseness, voice fatigue, and difficulty hitting high notes. Vocal nodule and Vocal polyp Vocal Nodule (Singer or screamer's nodule) Vocal Polyp (Option A) Cause Chronic vocal abuse (teachers, actors, vendors or pop singers.) Sudden Vocal abuse like shouting (Men in the age group of 30-50 years). Heavy smoking Laterality Bilateral or symmetrical Unilateral Location Free edge of vocal cord at the junction of anterior 1/3rd and posterior 2/3rd. This is the area of maximum vibration of the vocal cord. Same as vocal nodules. Appearance Sessile , Reddish in the early stage and white in the chronic stage Smooth and pedunculated. Symptoms Hoarseness, vocal fatigue and neck pain on prolonged phonation. Hoarseness of voice and diplophonia (double voice due to different vibrating frequencies of two vocal cords) Large polyps- dyspnea, stridor, choking. Treatment Initially, voice rest. If it fails - microscopic excision without injuring the vocal ligament Speech therapy Microscopic excision Speech therapy Vocal cysts (Option B): are fluid-filled sacs that can form on the vocal folds and are usually caused by a blocked mucous gland. Reinke's oedema (Option D): is a condition in which the vocal folds become swollen and fluid-filled due to chronic exposure to irritants such as smoking or gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD). Although Reinke's oedema can cause hoarseness, it is less likely to be the cause in a patient who is a teacher and presents with hoarseness of voice.",

By performing a high tracheostomy in these cases, the surgical opening is made in a clean area lower down, providing a clear airway and facilitating breathing without obstruction. Incorrect options Option A - Vocal cord palsy: Vocal cord palsy refers to the paralysis or weakness of the vocal cords, which can lead to hoarseness, difficulty speaking or swallowing, and breathing difficulties. High tracheostomy is not directly indicated for vocal cord palsy as it does not address the underlying issue of vocal cord dysfunction. Option B - Tracheomalacia: Tracheomalacia is a condition characterized by the weakness or floppiness of the tracheal walls, leading to airway collapse during breathing. It can result in breathing difficulties, noisy breathing (stridor), and recurrent respiratory infections. Option C - Foreign body obstruction: Foreign body obstruction occurs when an object becomes lodged in the airway, blocking the flow of air.

Subglottic : Subglottic lesions refer to abnormalities or obstructions in the area below the vocal cords but above the trachea. While subglottic lesions can cause airway obstruction, they typically result in both inspiratory and expiratory stridor, as they affect airflow in both directions. Option C. Tracheal : Tracheal lesions specifically involve the trachea, which is the tube connecting the larynx (voice box) to the bronchi. Tracheal lesions can cause a range of respiratory symptoms, but inspiratory stridor is less commonly associated with isolated tracheal lesions. Option D.

      "explanation": "may be performed in cases of carcinoma of the larynx to provide an adequate airway below the tumor. Tracheostomy Surgical opening in the trachea is called a tracheostomy. If a tracheostomy is done at the level of the 1st tracheal ring. This is called a High tracheostomy. Mainly done in patients with total laryngectomy. Incorrect options: Option A - Laryngeal papilloma: This option is incorrect. Laryngeal papilloma is a condition characterized by the presence of benign growths in the larynx. It does not require a high tracheostomy. Option C - Bilateral vocal fold palsy: This option is incorrect. Bilateral vocal fold palsy refers to the paralysis or weakness of both vocal folds. It does not require a high tracheostomy. Option D - Laryngomalacia: This option is incorrect. Laryngomalacia is a condition in infants where the tissues of the larynx are floppy, leading to partial airway obstruction. It does not typically require a high tracheostomy. Reference: .",

Rima glottidis: Space between between 2 true cords Ventricle: Space between false cords above and true cords below Elongation from ventricle: Saccule Incorrect options: Option A - Supraglottis: This option is incorrect. The supraglottis is the region above the glottis and is not the narrowest part of the airway in an infant. Option B - Glottis: This option is incorrect. While the glottis is a critical part of the airway, it is not the narrowest part of the airway in an infant. Option D - Epiglottis: This option is incorrect. The epiglottis is a flap of tissue that covers the glottis during swallowing and protects the airway. However, it is not the narrowest part of the airway in an infant. Reference: .",

      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "prominence, is primarily due to the cartilage known as the thyroid cartilage. The thyroid cartilage is the largest cartilage of the larynx and forms the front part of the laryngeal skeleton. In males, it tends to be more prominent, giving rise to the visible Adam's apple. Unpaired/ Hyaline Ala (2 ALA of single cartilage) 90 in males 120 in females Oblique line of thyroid cartilage gives attachment to Sternum to thyroid: Sternothyroid muscle Thyroid to hyoid: Thyrohyoid Thyroid to pharynx: Thyropharyngus Thyroid cartilage gives attachment to Epiglottis: Above Vocal cords: Below Incorrect options: Option B: The cricoid cartilage is a ring-shaped cartilage located below the thyroid cartilage in the larynx. It forms the base of the larynx and provides support to the vocal cords. The cricoid cartilage does not contribute to the protrusion of the Adam's apple. Option C: Hyoid; The hyoid bone is a U-shaped bone located in the neck, above the larynx. It serves as a point of attachment for various muscles and ligaments in the neck and plays a role in swallowing and speech. However, it is not directly associated with the protrusion of the Adam's apple. Reference: .",

      "question": "Which nerve injury is responsible for the development of postoperative aspiration in a patient who underwent surgery at the lateral part of the skull without any change in voice?",
      "options": {
        "A": "High vagal injury",
        "B": "Recurrent laryngeal nerve",
        "C": "Superior laryngeal nerve",
        "D": "Glossopharyngeal nerve"
      },
      "correct_answer": "D",
      "explanation": "glossopharyngeal nerve can disrupt the normal sensory feedback involved in the swallowing reflex. This can result in impaired swallowing and aspiration, particularly in the postoperative period when swallowing may be compromised. Incorrect Options: Option A - High vagal injury: The vagus nerve (cranial nerve X) plays a role in several functions, including swallowing and voice production. However, a \"high vagal injury\" typically refers to damage to the vagus nerve at or above the level of the superior laryngeal nerve (SLN) and recurrent laryngeal nerve (RLN) branches. High vagal injuries are more likely to affect voice production rather than cause isolated aspiration without voice change. Option B - Recurrent laryngeal nerve: The recurrent laryngeal nerve (a branch of the vagus nerve) innervates the intrinsic muscles of the larynx, which are crucial for voice production. Damage can lead to vocal cord paralysis and voice changes, but it is not typically associated with isolated aspiration without voice change. Option C - Superior laryngeal nerve: The superior laryngeal nerve (also a branch of the vagus nerve) has two branches: the internal branch and the external branch. Damagecan affect the sensory innervation of the larynx above the vocal cords but is less likely to cause aspiration without voice change. Glossopharyngeal nerve: The glossopharyngeal nerve (cranial nerve IX) plays a role in swallowing and sensory functions in the throat, including the sensation of the oropharynx. Damage can lead to impaired swallowing and potential aspiration. Reference: .",

      "question": "What is the probable cause of surgical emphysema in a patient following an emergency tracheostomy?",
      "options": {
        "A": "High tracheostomy",
        "B": "Tear in posterior tracheal wall",
        "C": "Block in tracheostomy",
        "D": "Tight suture around tracheostomy site"
      },
      "correct_answer": "D",
      "explanation": "around the tracheostomy site can obstruct the normal passage of air, causing air to escape into the surrounding subcutaneous tissues. This can lead to the accumulation of air under the skin, resulting in surgical emphysema. The tight suture creates a seal that prevents air from escaping through the tracheostomy tube, forcing it into the surrounding tissues instead. Incorrect Options: Option A. High tracheostomy: A high tracheostomy refers to a tracheostomy performed above the second or third tracheal cartilage. While a high tracheostomy can cause complications, such as injury to blood vessels or the thyroid gland, it is not directly associated with surgical emphysema. Option B: Tear in posterior tracheal wall A tear in the posterior tracheal wall can lead to air escaping into the mediastinum and potentially causing pneumomediastinum rather than subcutaneous emphysema. Option C. Block in tracheostomy: A block in the tracheostomy tube can lead to respiratory distress and the buildup of secretions. While it requires immediate attention, it is not directly related to surgical emphysema. Reference: .",

      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "the initial investigation carried out. A chest X-ray can help identify the location and potential presence of a foreign body in the lungs or airways. It provides a quick and non-invasive way to assess the situation and determine the appropriate course of action. Incorrect Options: Option A - Rigid bronchoscopy : Rigid bronchoscopy is a procedure in which a rigid tube is inserted into the airways to visualize and remove foreign bodies or other obstructions. While this is indeed a procedure that may be carried out to remove a foreign body from a child's lung, it is not typically the immediate investigation performed right after a child ingests or inhales a foreign body. Option C - Direct laryngoscopy: Direct laryngoscopy is a procedure that involves examining the larynx (voice box) and adjacent structures using a laryngoscope. While this procedure might be used to examine the upper airway and larynx, it is not typically the first investigation performed when a foreign body is suspected in the lower airways or lungs. Option D - Flexible endoscopy: Flexible endoscopy involves using a flexible tube with a camera on the end to visualize internal structures. While this procedure can be used to examine the airways and remove foreign bodies, it might not be the immediate investigation performed right after a child inhales or ingests a foreign body.
