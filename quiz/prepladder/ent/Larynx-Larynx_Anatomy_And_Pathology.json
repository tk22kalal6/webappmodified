They are typically bilateral and located at the junction of the anterior and posterior thirds of the vocal cords, matching the patient's presentation. Vocal Nodule (Singer or screamer's nodule) Vocal Polyp Cause Chronic vocal abuse (teachers, actors, vendors or pop singers. ) Sudden Vocal abuse like shouting (Men in the age group of 30-50 years). Heavy smoking Laterality Bilateral or symmetrical Unilateral Location Free edge of vocal cord at the junction of anterior 1/3rd and posterior 2/3rd. This is the area of maximum vibration of the vocal cord. Same as vocal nodules. Appearance Sessile , Reddish in the early stage and white in the chronic stage Smooth and pedunculated. Symptoms Hoarseness, vocal fatigue and neck pain on prolonged phonation. Hoarseness of voice and diplophonia (double voice due to different vibrating frequencies of two vocal cords) Large polyps- dyspnea, stridor, choking. Treatment Initially, voice rest. If it fails - microscopic excision without injuring the vocal ligament Speech therapy Microscopic excision Speech therapy Vocal Polyp (Option A): Vocal polyps are typically unilateral , not bilateral, and arise from sudden vocal trauma rather than chronic abuse. Laryngeal Papilloma (Option C): Papillomas are usually unilateral , cause wart-like growths, and are associated with the HPV virus . They do not typically present as bilateral nodular lesions from chronic vocal strain as in the case provided. Reinke's Edema(Option D) involves bilateral swelling of the vocal cords but is caused by chronic smoking or vocal misuse, presenting as diffuse oedema rather than discrete nodules. The patient's symptoms suggest a localized lesion, making this less likely.",

      "explanation": "Correct Answer: A) Juvenile-onset laryngeal papillomatosis Explanation: Juvenile-onset laryngeal Papillomatosis is the correct answer because it typically presents in young children with multiple lesions and symptoms like hoarseness and stridor, caused by HPV 6 and 11. M / C benign larynx tumor with premalignant potential. Caused by HPV6 and HPV11 There are two types of papillomas. Aspect Juvenile-Onset Laryngeal Papillomatosis Adult-Onset Laryngeal Papillomatosis Age Infants and young children 30-50years Sex No sex predisposition. More common in males. Mode of transmission Mother to child during vaginal delivery Sexual intercourse. Number Multiple Single Location Mostly the supraglottic and glottic regions. But can also involve the subglottis, trachea and bronchi. Anterior half of vocal cord or the anterior commisure. Presentation Hoarseness, aphonia, respiratory difficulty and stridor. Change in voice (initial), airway obstruction, respiratory distress and stridor. Aggressive Aggressive, recurrence is common after excision. Less aggressive does not recur after excision. Recurrence rate High Low Treatment of Laryngeal Papillomas: Surgical : CO2 laser excision during microlaryngoscopy (avoiding vocal ligament injury). Alternative : Removal with cup forceps or debrider if no CO2 laser. Medical Adjuvants : Interferon alpha-2a : Effective but with side effects (fever, chills, myalgia, etc.). 13-cis-retinoic acid : Alternative with significant side effects. Vocal Polyp (Option B): Vocal polyps are typically unilateral and occur in adults with sudden vocal strain, not children with progressive hoarseness and multiple lesions. Adult-Onset Laryngeal Papillomatosis (Option C): This condition occurs in adults (30-50 years) and typically involves single lesions , not multiple warty lesions as seen in this pediatric patient. Vocal Nodule (Option D): Vocal Nodules are bilateral, associated with chronic vocal abuse , and usually occur in adults or professionals with voice strain, not in children with multiple lesions and stridor.",

Tuberculosis of the Larynx Lupus of larynx Features Secondary to pulmonary tuberculosis. Affects middle-aged males. Spread occurs via bronchogenic or haematogenous routes. Tubercle bacilli from sputum settle in laryngeal mucosa, leading to infection Indolent tubercular infection associated with lupus of the nose and pharynx. Lupus primarily affects the anterior part of the larynx. Pathology : Affects the posterior larynx more than the anterior. Common sites: interarytenoid fold, ventricular bands, vocal cords, and epiglottis. Formation of submucosal tubercles, which may ulcerate and cause cellular infiltration (pseudoedema). Starts in the epiglottis , which may be destroyed. Lesion spreads to the aryepiglottic folds and ventricular bands . No association with pulmonary tuberculosis Clinical Features : Weakness of voice (early symptom) Hoarseness Severe pain, radiating to ears, especially with ulceration Dysphagia in later stages. Painless condition. Often asymptomatic, found incidentally during lupus evaluation. Signs : Hyperaemia of vocal cords (impaired adduction) Swelling in inter arytenoid region with a mamillated appearance Ulceration of vocal cords (\" mouse-nibbled\" appearance ) Superficial ragged ulcerations on arytenoids and inter arytenoid region Granulation tissue in inter arytenoid region Pseudoedema of the epiglottis (\" turban epiglottis\" ) Swelling of ventricular bands and aryepiglottic folds The pallor of the surrounding mucosa Destruction of the epiglottis. Involvement of aryepiglottic folds and ventricular bands. Diagnosis : X-ray of chest Sputum examination for tuberculosis Biopsy of laryngeal lesion to exclude carcinoma Routine laryngeal examination in patients with lupus of the nose . No pulmonary TB involvement. Treatment : Treat the pulmonary tuberculosis (antitubercular drugs). Voice rest Antitubercular drugs . The prognosis is generally good.

LARYNGEAL CAVITY The laryngeal cavity extends from the laryngeal inlet aryepiglottic fold to the lower border of the cricoid cartilage, where it continues with the trachea. It is divided into three parts by two pairs of folds, the vestibular and vocal folds : Vestibule : Located between the laryngeal inlet and the vestibular folds, its anterior wall is the epiglottis, the sides are the aryepiglottic folds, and the posterior wall is formed by the mucosa covering the arytenoids. Ventricle (Sinus of Larynx) : A space between the vestibular and vocal folds. It contains the saccule , a mucosal diverticulum that lubricates the vocal cords. An abnormal enlargement of the saccule can form a laryngocele . Subglottic Space : Extends from the vocal cords to the lower border of the cricoid cartilage. The rima vestibularis is the space between the vestibular folds (Option A & D ruled out) , while the rima glottidis is the narrowest part of the larynx, located between the vocal folds. It is divided into an anterior phonatory portion and a posterior respiratory portion. Mucous membranes of the larynx: Pseudostratified Ciliated Columnar Epithelium (Respiratory-Type): Most of the larynx. Non-Keratinizing Stratified Squamous Epithelium: Upper Half of the Posterior Surface of the Epiglottis Upper Part of the Aryepiglottic Fold Posterior Glottis Vocal Folds (Vocal Cords) (Option B ruled out)",

      },
      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: C) The cuneiform cartilages provide support to the vocal cords. Explanation: Cuneiform cartilages are rod-shaped and located in the aryepiglottic fold, but they provide support to the aryepiglottic fold, not the vocal cords. The vocal cords are attached to the vocal process of the arytenoid cartilages. CARTILAGE DESCRIPTION ARYTENOID Paired Hyaline Cartilage. Each arytenoid cartilage is shaped like a pyramid. Base : The base of each arytenoid cartilage articulates with the cricoid cartilage. (Option A ruled out) Muscular Process : A lateral projection where intrinsic laryngeal muscles attach. Vocal Process : Anterior projection that provides attachment for the vocal cords. Apex : The top part of the arytenoid cartilage that supports the corniculate cartilage. CORNICULATE Cartilages of Santorini There are two corniculate cartilages, one on each side. Elastic cartilage Each corniculate cartilage articulates with the apex of the arytenoid cartilage. (Option B ruled out) They resemble horns (hence the name \"corniculate\") and function to support the aryepiglottic fold. (Option D ruled out) CUNEIFORM Cartilages of Wrisberg Paired elastic Cartilage. Each cuneiform cartilage has a rod-like shape. Positioned in the aryepiglottic fold in front of the corniculate cartilage. Provides passive support to the aryepiglottic fold, enhancing its stability.",

      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: C) It is connected to the hyoid bone by the hyoepiglottic ligament. Explanation: The epiglottis is connected to the hyoid bone by the hyoepiglottic ligament. Epiglottis Unpaired Elastic Cartilage (Option A ruled out) Shape: Leaf-shaped yellow elastic cartilage. Location: Forms the anterior wall of the laryngeal inlet. Attachments: Connected to the hyoid bone by the hyoepiglottic ligament , dividing it into suprahyoid and infrahyoid portions. The petiole attaches it to the thyroid cartilage just above the vocal cords. Anterior Surface: Preepiglottic Space: Located in front of the epiglottis, between the anterior surface and the thyrohyoid membrane/upper thyroid cartilage. Filled with fat, it may be involved in supraglottic cancers or the base of tongue carcinomas. (Option B ruled out) Posterior Surface: Tubercle of Epiglottis: A bulge that may obstruct the view of the anterior commissure during indirect laryngoscopy. Contains pits for mucous glands and occasional perforations, which may facilitate cancer spread to the preepiglottic space. Clinical Significance: Cancer Spread: Supraglottic cancers can invade the pre-epiglottic space through epiglottic perforations. Non-Essential for Swallowing: The epiglottis can be safely amputated in cases of cancer or trauma without significant risk of aspiration.

      "options": {
        "A": "Displacement of the thyroid cartilage from its normal position",

        "D": "Age-related ossification of cricoid cartilage"
      },
      "correct_answer": "D",
      "explanation": "Correct answer: D) Age-related ossification of cricoid cartilage Explanation: The cricoid cartilage, made of hyaline cartilage , tends to calcify as part of the aging process, typically beginning around 25 and completing by 65, leading to changes seen on imaging. Cricoid Cartilage Complete ring : The only laryngeal cartilage forms a full ring, resembling a signet ring with a broader posterior lamina and a narrow anterior arch. Articulations : Forms the cricothyroid joint with the thyroid cartilage, allowing rotation along a transverse axis. Forms the cricoarytenoid joint with the arytenoid cartilages, permitting rotational and gliding movements, which control vocal cord motion. Attachments : The cricotracheal membrane connects it to the first tracheal ring. The cricovocal membrane attaches to its arch, forming the vocal ligament. Clinical relevance : In children, the cricoid cartilage is smaller in diameter than the glottis, making it the narrowest part of the airway, crucial for choosing the correct endotracheal tube size. Calcification in older adults can appear as a foreign body on X-rays. Subglottic foreign bodies may lodge near the cricoid cartilage, especially in children. Displacement of the thyroid cartilage from its normal position (Option A): Displacement of the thyroid cartilage, such as dislocation from the cricoid, is not suggested by the presence of calcified structures on imaging. Formation of fibrous tissue in the cricoid cartilage (Option B): The cricoid cartilage is primarily hyaline cartilage, and fibrous tissue is not a typical finding.it can be associated with prolonged ET tube insertion Inflammatory changes in the arytenoid cartilage (Option C): Inflammatory conditions of the arytenoid cartilage might cause vocal cord dysfunction or airway obstruction, but would not lead to calcified structures in the cricoid cartilage.",

Thyroid Cartilage The thyroid cartilage is the largest cartilage in the larynx. (Option A ruled out) It is an unpaired hyaline cartilage of the larynx. (Option C) It has two alae (wings) that meet at an angle: 90Â° in males and 120Â° in females. (Option B ruled out) The vocal cords are attached to the middle of this thyroid angle. Most foreign bodies in the larynx get trapped above the vocal cords above the middle of the thyroid cartilage.
