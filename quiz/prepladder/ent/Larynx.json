      "question": "A 16-year-old boy presents with a voice that sounds similar to that of a female, characterized by a high-pitched voice despite the completion of puberty. What could be a potential underlying cause related to the vocal cords for this condition?",
      "options": {
        "A": "Immature growth of vocal cords leading to lengthening of vocal cords",
        "B": "Immature growth of vocal cords leading to relative shortening of vocal cords",
        "C": "Immature growth of vocal cords leading to incomplete closure of the anterior part of vocal cords",
        "D": "Immature growth of vocal cords leading to excessive thickening of vocal cords"
      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: B) Immature growth of vocal cords leading to relative shortening of vocal cords properly. During puberty, vocal cords typically lengthen and thicken, resulting in a deeper voice. However, if the vocal cords have undergone immature growth, they might not lengthen adequately. This can lead to a condition where the vocal cords are relatively shorter than expected, contributing to a higher-pitched voice. Puberphonia (Mutational falsetto): Is a condition where the voice remains high-pitched during puberty despite normal physical and sexual development. Typically, during puberty, the vocal cords lengthen and thicken, resulting in a deeper voice. In puberphonia, this process is incomplete, leading to a persistently high-pitched, childlike voice. Treatment: The primary approach involves Voice training techniques. One effective method is Gutzmann's pressure test, which applies backward and downward pressure on the thyroid prominence (Adam's apple) to relax the vocal cords and help produce a lower pitch. Patients then practice producing a lower-pitched voice through exercises with syllables, words, and numbers. Type III thyroplasty may also be considered as a surgical option for some cases (shortening/relaxing of cord). Immature growth of vocal cords leading to lengthening of vocal cords (Option A) : Lengthening typically results in a deeper voice, not a higher-pitched one. Immature growth of vocal cords leading to incomplete closure of the anterior part of vocal cords (Option C ): Incomplete closure usually causes hoarseness, not a high-pitched voice. Immature growth of vocal cords leading to excessive thickening of vocal cords (Option D): Excessive thickening results in a deeper voice, not a higher-pitched one.

      },
      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: C) Barking dog position Explanation: Barking dog position: Supine with the head tilted back and neck extended. Optimal for laryngoscopy as it aligns the oral, pharyngeal, and laryngeal axes, enhancing visibility and access to the larynx. Direct Laryngoscopy Category Indications Diagnostic Infeasibility of Indirect Laryngoscopy (e.g. in infants/young children with symptoms suggesting laryngeal/hypopharyngeal pathology) Failure of Indirect Laryngoscopy (e.g. excessive gag reflex, overhanging epiglottis) Examination of Hidden Areas (e.g. hypopharynx: base of tongue, valleculae, lower piriform fossa; larynx: infrahyoid epiglottis, anterior commissure, ventricles, subglottic region) Determining Extent and Biopsy (e.g. to assess growths and obtain biopsy samples) Therapeutic Removal of Benign Lesions (e.g., papillomas, fibromas, vocal nodules, polyps, cysts) Foreign Body Extraction (from the larynx and hypopharynx) Dilatation of Laryngeal Strictures Contraindications Cervical spine diseases or injuries. Significant Respiratory Obstruction Anesthesia General anesthesia is preferred. Position Supine Position: Head elevated 10-15 cm with a pillow or head flap. The \"barking-dog\" (Boyce's) position involves neck flexion on the thorax and head extension at the atlanto-occipital joint. (Option C) Complications Injury to Lips/Tongue: Dental Injury Bleeding: From the operative site. Laryngeal Edema: Potentially leading to respiratory distress. Rose position (Option A): The patient is placed in a supine position with the head extended and supported by a pillow or ring placed under the shoulders. This facilitates neck extension, Commonly used for procedures involving the mouth, throat, and larynx, such as tonsillectomy, adenoidectomy, and endotracheal intubation. The position allows for optimal visualization of the airway and easier access for surgical procedures in the head and neck region. Fowler's position (Option B) : Seated with the back of the bed elevated. This position can hinder airway alignment, making visualization of the larynx challenging. Fowler's position is a seated position (45-60 degrees) used for: Respiratory Support: Enhances lung expansion for easier breathing. Cardiovascular Stability: Improves venous return and reduces heart workload. Gastrointestinal Motility: Aids digestion and reduces aspiration risk. Supine Neutral position (Option D): Flat with the head in a natural alignment. Not ideal for laryngoscopy; may require adjustments for proper laryngeal visualization.",

      "explanation": "Correct Answer: D) Anterior commisure Explanation: Indirect laryngoscopy primarily allows visualization of structures such as the vocal cords , pyriform fossa , and cricoid cartilage . The vocal cords are directly observed, as they are essential for voice production. The pyriform fossa, located on either side of the laryngeal inlet, and the cricoid cartilage can also be visualized. Posteriorly located arytenoid cartilages can also be visualized. However, the anterior commissure is typically not well visualized through this technique.

      "explanation": "Correct Answer: D) Type I Explanation: Type I thyroplasty is preferred in those with unilateral superior laryngeal nerve paralysis with no scope for improvement. Thyroplasty is a type of phono surgery that helps improve the quality of voice . It is used in patients with unilateral superior laryngeal nerve paralysis paralysis that does not improve, and the following conditions favor the surgery as well: Dysphagia High degree of vocal disability or vocal demand Poor functional prognosis Large glottic gap (2mm to 3mm) Posterior glottic gap Shortened life expectancy Ishikki first described using an alloplastic material (Silastic) for the surgery and the advantage of using the patients' voice as feedback during surgery and hence the use of local anesthesia. The implants include Gore-Tex ribbon, silicon, titanium and hydroxylapatite . Advantages : Can modify the size of the glottic aperture, the plane of vocal fold closure and vocal fold length. Maintains the laryngeal dynamics and does not affect the mass or stiffness of the vocal folds. Ishikki described four types of thyroplasty: Type I/Medialization thyroplasty Type II (Option A) Type III (Option C) Type IV (Option B) It is the medial displacement of the vocal cord using an implant placed in the thyroid cartilage via a window. Indications: Unilateral vocal cord paralysis Bilateral bowed vocal cords due to aging Soft tissue defects of vocal cords Adductor palsy Unilateral complete (recurrent & superior laryngeal nerve) palsy A waiting period of 12 months is necessary and injection laryngoplasty must be done during this time. It is lateral displacement of the vocal cord. Involves the insertion of a shim to separate the anterior vocal cords. Indication: Abductor palsy Bilateral recurrent laryngeal nerve palsy Used to shorten (relax) the vocal cord This lowers the pitch Indications: Mutational falsetto/ Puberphonia Gender transformation surgery from female to male Used to lengthen (tighten) the vocal cord It elevates the pitch Indications: Androphonia Gender transformation from male to female Lax vocal cord and bowing due to age or trauma",

        "D": "The degree of strictures is measured by MRI"
      },
      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "diagnosis Correct Answer: C) A subglottic diameter of less than 4mm in a full-term neonate makes the diagnosis Explanation: The diagnosis of subglottic stenosis is made according to the subglottic diameter in neonates. Congenital subglottic stenosis is caused due to the gross thickening of the anterior lamina of the abnormal cricoid or a small, elliptical, thickened cricoid with excessive submucosal soft tissue. There may also be anterior fusion of the vocal cords, leading to a web formation with subglottic extension. Diagnosis is made according to the subglottic diameter: Full-term neonate: <4mm (normal 4.5-5.5mm) (Option C) Preterm neonate: <3mm (normal 3.5mm) Clinical features Biphasic stridor Normal cry Recurrent croup if superimposed edema from upper respiratory tract infections (URTIs) is present. Investigations (Option D): The gold standard for pediatric airway evaluation is rigid endoscopy . Microlaryngoscopy and bronchoscopy (MLB) determine the exact location of the stenosis. MRI helps measure the degree of strictures. The Myer-Cotton grading of laryngotracheal stenosis Management Grade I: 0-50% obstruction Grade I subglottic stenosis usually requires no surgical intervention. (Option B) Grade II: 51-70% obstruction (Option A) Grade II stenosis can be reconstructed by means of a laryngotracheal reconstruction (LTR). Grade III: 71-99% obstruction Mild grade III stenosis repaired by anterior graft with posterior cricoid split +/- posterior cartilage grafting. Severe grade III stenosis repaired by anterior and posterior grafts . Grade IV: 100% obstruction Grade IV stenosis needs anterior and posterior grafts with prolonged stenting.

      "explanation": "Correct Answer: B) Cricothyrotomy Explanation: Cricothyrotomy quickly establishes an airway when intubation fails, especially in cases of severe maxillofacial trauma , to prevent hypoxia. Cricothyrotomy Definition Procedure for opening the airway through the cricothyroid membrane. Indication Emergency cricothyrotomy is indicated in any CICO (Cannot Intubate, Cannot Oxygenate) scenario. Situations that may lead to CICO include: Oral or maxillofacial trauma Cervical spine trauma Profuse oral hemorrhage Copious emesis Anatomic abnormalities preventing endotracheal intubation Clinical Significance Cricothyrotomy is the final step in the difficult airway algorithm for CICO scenarios. Types 1. Needle or Small Bore Cannula Cricothyrotomy: A narrow-caliber rigid needle or flexible cannula is inserted through the cricothyroid membrane. Limited for temporary use due to inadequate gas exchange, risking hypercarbia. 2. Large Cannula Cricothyrotomy: Cannula (>4mm internal diameter) provides adequate ventilation with standard breathing systems. Exhalation occurs through the cannula, even with complete upper airway obstruction. 3. Surgical Cricothyrotomy: Involves making a 3 cm midline incision, followed by a horizontal incision in the inferior part of the cricothyroid membrane, and the insertion of a 6mm tube. Cricothyrotomy tubes should be converted to tracheostomies within a few days to prevent dysphonia and subglottic stenosis. Complications Bleeding Lacerations of tracheal cartilage Perforation of the trachea Creation of a false tract Infection Long-term complications: Subglottic stenosis, Voice change Contraindications No absolute contraindications in CICO scenarios. Relative contraindications: Known tracheal surgery Fractured larynx Laryngotracheal disruption Children Image Bag-mask ventilation (Option A) is ineffective in patients with maxillofacial trauma due to disarranged anatomy and potential bleeding, which hinder proper mask fit and air transfer to the lungs. Endotracheal intubation (Option B) is likely to be difficult in maxillofacial trauma patients due to obstructed views of the vocal cords from blood, secretions, and tissue debris. Supraglottic airway devices (Option C) may not be suitable for maxillofacial trauma patients due to limited oral space and the risk of displacement, making them unsuitable for definitive airway management.",

      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: C) Mid tracheostomy Explanation: Mid-tracheostomy is preferred for long-term airway access and minimizes complications. Tracheostomy: Is making an opening in the anterior wall of the trachea and converting it into a stoma on the skin surface. Types: High Tracheostomy (Option A) Mid-Tracheostomy (Option C) Low Tracheostomy (Option B) Location: Done above the thyroid isthmus (isthmus lies against 1st, 2nd, and 4th tracheal rings) and involves the 1st tracheal ring. Risks: Perichondritis of cricoid cartilage and subglottic stenosis. Only Indication: Carcinoma of the larynx (since the entire larynx will be removed, and a new tracheostome will be made lower). Location: Done through the 2nd or 3rd tracheal rings and involves the division of or retraction of the thyroid isthmus to expose the trachea. Most Preferred technique The procedure Location: Done below the level of thyroid isthmus (below the 3rd tracheal ring). Challenges: Trachea is deeper at this level. Close proximity to large blood vessels. Difficulty with tracheostomy tube impinging on the suprasternal notch. Cricothyrotomy (Option D) is not suitable for prolonged ventilation; it is a temporary measure and should be followed by a tracheostomy once the patient is stabilized.",

      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "Correct answer: A) Decannulation and reintubation Explanation: The scenario here is of partial obstruction that does not need decannulation and reintubation which is preferred in cases of complete obstruction . Management of Tracheostomy Tube Obstruction Partial Obstruction Management Constant Supervision: Monitor the patient for signs of obstruction; a nurse or relative should be present. Communication: Provide the patient with a bell or paper pad and pencil for communication. Suctioning: (Option B) Perform suction every 30 minutes as needed. Use sterile catheters; only apply suction while withdrawing to prevent mucosal injury. Prevent Crusting and Tracheitis: Humidification: Use a humidifier, steam tent, or ultrasonic nebulizer. Saline Instillation: Instill normal or hypotonic saline or Ringer’s lactate every 2-3 hours to loosen crusts. (Option C) Mucolytics: Consider acetylcysteine to liquefy thick secretions. (Option D) Complete Obstruction Management Immediate Response: If obstruction is suspected, ensure the tracheostomy tube is not blocked or displaced. Assess for any displacement or blockage of the tube. Decannulation Procedures: Preparation: Perform in the operating theater with trained personnel and equipment for reintubation available (laryngoscope, endotracheal tubes). Plugging: Plug the tracheostomy tube and observe the patient closely. Monitoring: Watch for respiratory distress, tachycardia, and use pulse oximetry for oxygen saturation. Reintubation: Be prepared for immediate reintubation if the patient cannot tolerate the obstruction. Complications to Monitor Immediate : Hemorrhage Apnea due to CO I washout Pneumothorax from pleural injury Injury to recurrent laryngeal nerves Aspiration of blood Injury to the esophagus, potentially causing tracheoesophageal fistula Intermediate : Reactionary or secondary bleeding Displacement of the tube Tracheostomy Tubes Still Valuable?.

      "explanation": "Correct Answer: B) Perform emergency tracheostomy Explanation: In cases of complete airway obstruction caused by a laryngeal foreign body , where measures such as the Heimlich maneuver have failed , an emergency tracheostomy is necessary to secure the airway and facilitate ventilation. Tracheal Foreign Body Laryngeal Foreign Body Sharp Foreign Body: Cough and hemoptysis. Loose Foreign Body (e.g., seed): May move between carina and vocal cords, causing: \"Audible slap\" and \"palpatory thud\" Asthmatoid wheeze heard best at patient’s open mouth Complete Obstruction: Can cause asphyxia and sudden death unless urgent resuscitative measures are taken urgently. Partial Obstruction: Cause discomfort or pain in throat, hoarseness, stridor, cough, aphonia, dyspnea, wheezing, and hemoptysis. Radiology: Soft Tissue X-ray: PA and lateral views of neck in its extended position for radio-opaque and sometimes radiolucent foreign body in larynx/trachea. Emergency removal of foreign bodies is not typically indicated unless: Airway obstruction is present. Foreign bodies are of vegetable origin (e.g., seeds) and likely to swell. Methods for Foreign Body Removal Rigid bronchoscopy. Bronchoscopy with C-arm fluoroscopy. Use of Dormia basket or Fogarty's balloon for rounded objects. (Option A) Tracheostomy first followed by bronchoscopy through the tracheostome. Thoracotomy and bronchotomy for peripheral foreign",

      "explanation": "Correct Answer: D) One-way (check valve) obstruction Explanation: The chest X-ray showing hyperinflation of the left lung with a mediastinal shift indicates a one-way (check valve) obstruction . This occurs when the foreign body allows air to enter but prevents it from exiting, leading to trapped air and overinflation (obstructive emphysema). Bronchial Foreign Body: Common Location Right bronchus (due to its wider lumen and alignment with the trachea) Clinical Triad Cough, wheezing, and diminished air entry to the lung.
