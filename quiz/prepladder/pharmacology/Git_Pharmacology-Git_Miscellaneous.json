      "explanation": "Correct answer: D) Domperidone Explanation: The above scenario suggests levodopa-induced nausea and vomiting, and the drug of choice for the same is domperidone, which is a dopamine receptor (D2) antagonist. D2 receptor antagonists : Domperidone : Treats levodopa-induced nausea and vomiting. It does not cross the blood-brain barrier (vs metoclopramide) and hence does not interfere with the therapeutic effects of levodopa, but inhibits the D2 receptors on CTZ © decreasing vomiting. Metoclopramide : 5 HT4 agonist + D2 antagonist + raised Ach Crosses the blood-brain barrier and interferes with the therapeutic effects of levodopa, hence not preferred in levodopa-induced vomiting (Option A) Causes extrapyramidal side effects.

      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Correct answer: C) Prochlorperazine Explanation: The drug of choice for migraine-induced vomiting is an antipsychotic such as prochlorperazine and chlorpromazine. Antipsychotics : They have antihistamine and anticholinergic properties and hence can be used in migraine-induced nausea and vomiting. They inhibit D2 receptors in CTZ, which is the mechanism behind preventing nausea and vomiting. They are also indicated in post-chemotherapy, postoperative nausea and vomiting and also in motion sickness. Lorazepam (Option A): The sedative, amnesic and anxiolytic properties of lorazepam help be used as an anticipatory medication in patients with terminal diseases. Nabilone ( Option B) which is a CB1 receptor agonist, is used prophylactically for post-chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting. Dexamethasone ( Option D) (Corticosteroids) reduce inflammation © reduce the inflammatory mediators like serotonin, dopamine, and substance P; mainly used in chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting.

      },
      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "Correct answer: A) Decreases cholesterol absorption from the intestine Explanation: Ursodeoxycholic acid acts by decreasing cholesterol absorption from the intestine. Ursodeoxycholic acid is a naturally occurring hydrophilic bile acid. When taken orally, it Alters relative concentrations of bile acids by reducing its absorption from the intestine Decreases biliary lipid secretion Reduces cholesterol content in bile, making it less likely to form gallstones It is also cytoprotective in cholestatic liver diseases like primary sclerosing cholangitis . Decreased cholesterol synthesis in the liver (Option B) is the mechanism of action of chenodeoxycholic acid and statins.

SHORT BOWEL SYNDROME : Short bowel syndrome (SBS) is a difficult and frequently debilitating condition characterised by malabsorption and chronic diarrhoea. It occurs when a large portion of the intestine is removed. 3 new drugs for the treatment of short bowel syndrome : Growth hormone (Option A) : © increases production of IGF-1 © stimulates growth of bowel cells © enhances nutrient absorption. Octreotide (Option B): © decreases intestinal secretions © decreases malabsorptive diarrhoea, Teduglutide (Option D) : it is a recombinant GLP2 analogue © increases the production of IGF-1 © stimulates gut epithelial proliferation.
