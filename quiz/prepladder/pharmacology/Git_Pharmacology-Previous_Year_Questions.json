      "question": "In paracetamol poisoning, N-acetylcysteine is administered as an antidote. How does it act to prevent toxicity?",
      "options": {
        "A": "Inhibits the toxin",
        "B": "Removes the toxin",
        "C": "Restores glutathione levels",
        "D": "Neutralizes liver enzymes"
      },
      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "paracetamol (acetaminophen) poisoning and primarily works by restoring glutathione levels to prevent liver damage. Mechanism of Paracetamol Toxicity: Paracetamol is metabolized by the liver into: Non-toxic metabolites (via sulfation & glucuronidation). A toxic metabolite, NAPQI (N-acetyl-p-benzoquinone imine), via CYP450. Normally, NAPQI is detoxified by glutathione (GSH) . In overdose , glutathione is depleted , allowing NAPQI to accumulate → hepatic necrosis . How NAC Works: Acts as a glutathione precursor , replenishing GSH stores. Enhances non-toxic sulfation pathway for paracetamol metabolism. Directly binds NAPQI in high doses, reducing toxicity. Management of Paracetamol poisoning Management Aspect Details Initial Treatment Gastric Lavage Administer activated charcoal or cholestyramine (effective within 30 minutes of ingestion) N-acetylcysteine (NAC) Therapy Initiate within 8 hours of ingestion; may be partially effective up to 24–36 hours post-overdose. Administration : IV: 140 mg/kg loading dose over 1 hour, followed by 70 mg/kg every 4 hours for 15–20 doses. Mechanism of Action NAC acts as a sulfhydryl donor, replenishing glutathione. Neutralizes toxic metabolites and prevents binding to cell proteins, reducing the severity of hepatic necrosis. Liver Transplantation Considered in cases of hepatic failure (jaundice, coagulopathy, confusion). King's College Criteria is used to predict the need for a liver transplant in patients with paracetamol-induced acute liver failure : Arterial blood pH < 7.30 Or all of the following: Prothrombin time (PT) > 100 seconds (INR > 6.5) Serum creatinine > 300 µ mol/L Grade III or IV hepatic encephalopathy. Inhibits the toxin (Option A) is incorrect because NAC does not inhibit NAPQI formation , it helps detoxify it . Removes the toxin (Option B) is incorrect because NAC does not directly remove paracetamol or NAPQI from the body. Neutralizes liver enzymes (Option D) is incorrect because NAC does not neutralize liver enzymes , it restores glutathione to prevent hepatic injury.

      "question": "What is the treatment of Zollinger-Ellison syndrome?",
      "options": {
        "A": "Cimetidine",
        "B": "Omeprazole",
        "C": "Misoprostol",
        "D": "Aluminium hydroxide"
      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer B - Omeprazole Explanation: Omeprazole is a proton pump inhibitor that can be used to treat Zollinger-Ellison syndrome, a condition characterised by excessive gastric acid secretion due to gastrin-secreting tumours (gastrinomas). Its treatment is aimed at controlling acid hypersecretion to prevent complications such as peptic ulcers. Omeprazole helps alleviate the symptoms and complications associated with Zollinger-Ellison syndrome. Other PPls such as pantoprazole, lansoprazole, and esomeprazole may also be used. Incorrect Options: Cimetidine (Option A) is an H2 receptor antagonist, reduces stomach acid production and can provide symptomatic relief for GERD and peptic ulcers. However, it is not the first-line treatment for Zollinger-Ellison syndrome, which requires more potent acid-suppressing medications due to excessive gastrin-induced acid secretion. Misoprostol (Option C) is a prostaglandin analogue that has cytoprotective properties and can help prevent gastric ulcers caused by nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). While it may be used for certain conditions involving gastric ulcers, it is not typically considered a primary treatment for Zollinger-Ellison syndrome. Aluminium hydroxide (Option D) is an antacid that neutralizes stomach acid, providing temporary relief from symptoms like heartburn and indigestion. However, it does not address the underlying cause of Zollinger-Ellison syndrome and can cause constipation with excessive use.

        "D": "Na+/K+/Cl- ATPase pump"
      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: B) H+/K+ ATPase pump Explanation: Proton pump inhibitor suppresses gastric acid secretion by inhibiting the H+/K+ ATPase pump located in the parietal cells of the stomach. Proton pump inhibitor MOA It inhibits the H+/K+ ATPase pump located in the parietal cells of the stomach, thus reducing acid secretion in the stomach. Potency of PPI Rabeprazole > Lansoprazole > Rabeprazole > Omeprazole > Pantoprazole All PPIs have equal efficacy. Properties Acid production reduction persists for 2 to 4 days even after stopping the drug and resumes later. Duration of action is typically 2 to 4 days. Omeprazole is the fastest acting PPI. PPIs are acid labile; Enteric coating can protect from acid degradation. They should be taken on an empty stomach when only ~I0% of proton pumps are active, followed 1 hour later by a meal to activate the H+/K+/ATPase at a time when plasma concentration of the PPI is maximal. Side effects Chronic use of PPIs can lead to hypergastrinemia, which can further result in: ECL hyperplasia Fundic gland polyposis Atrophic gastritis Gastrointestinal upset (nausea, constipation, diarrhoea) Increased microbial growth leads to a higher risk of bacterial infection Increased risk of bone fractures due to hypocalcemia (reduced absorption of calcium) Reference: Goodman and Gilman's The Pharmacological Basis of Therapeutics, 14th Edition, Page 911- 912",

      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: B) Promethazine Explanation: Promethazine is an antihistamine drug with antiemetic properties; thus, it can be used for motion sickness. Mechanism of action of Promethazine: M1 receptor and H1 receptors are present in the inner ear labyrinth, and they get activated when there is movement (during journeys) in the semi-circular canal © activate the vestibular nerve © stimulate CTZ in the brain © nausea and vomiting. M1 and H1 receptor blockers block this effect © I stimulation of the CTZ © Anti-emetic action. Drug MOA Side effects Promethazine Antihistamine with antiemetic action Drowsiness, dry mouth, blurred vision Dimenhydrinate An antihistamine with anticholinergic properties Drowsiness, dry mouth, blurred vision, constipation Meclizine Scopolamine Anticholinergic with antiemetic action Drowsiness, dry mouth, blurred vision Cetirizine (Option A) is a second-generation antihistamine mainly used for allergies (e.g., rhinitis, urticaria). It does not have significant antiemetic or vestibular suppressant activity and is not used for motion sickness. Mizolastine (Option C ) is second-generation antihistamine for allergies like rhinitis and urticaria. It lacks central nervous system effects, and it is not used to treat motion sickness. Loratadine (Option D) is a non-sedating antihistamine for treating allergic conditions. It does not effectively block vestibular pathways and is not indicated for motion sickness.

        "C": "Steatorrhea",
        "D": "Colorectal cancer"
      },
      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer C - Steatorrhea Orlistat is a weight-loss medication that inhibits pancreatic and gastric lipase, leading to decreased absorption of dietary fat. The most common adverse effect of orlistat is steatorrhea (fatty, oily stools), which occurs due to the unabsorbed fats passing through the gastrointestinal tract. Acute kidney injury (Option A) is not a common side effect of orlistat. While there have been rare reports of kidney problems, they are not the most frequently observed adverse effects of orlistat. Osteoporosis (Option B) is not a typical side effect of orlistat. However, long-term use of orlistat can interfere with the absorption of fat-soluble vitamins (A, D, E, K), which may affect bone health but does not directly cause osteoporosis. Colorectal cancer (Option D): There is no direct evidence linking orlistat use with colorectal cancer. In fact, orlistat may have a potential role in reducing the risk of colorectal cancer due to its effects on weight loss and fat absorption.

      "question": "A tourist with a travel history to India presents with complaints of abdominal pain and multiple episodes of watery diarrhea. He reports having food at a local restaurant the previous night. Which of the following antidiarrheal agents is used in this condition?",
      "options": {
        "A": "Octreotide",
        "B": "Loperamide",
        "C": "Rifaximin",
        "D": "Bismuth subsalicylate"
      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "choice of antidiarrheal agent depends on the underlying cause of diarrhea and the severity of symptoms. Loperamide is an antidiarrheal agent that is commonly used for the symptomatic relief of diarrhea. It works by slowing down the movement of the bowel and increasing the absorption of water and electrolytes. Loperamide effectively reduces the frequency and duration of diarrhea and is often used to manage traveler's diarrhea. Incorrect Choices: Option a. Octreotide is a medication primarily used to manage conditions such as acromegaly and carcinoid syndrome. It works by reducing the secretion of certain hormones in the body. Octreotide is not typically used for the management of traveler's diarrhea. Option c. Rifaximin is an antibiotic used to treat gastrointestinal tract bacterial infections, including traveler's diarrhea. It inhibits the growth of bacteria in the gut. However, it is not typically used as an antidiarrheal agent for the symptomatic relief of diarrhea. Option d. Bismuth subsalicylate is commonly used to manage diarrhea, indigestion, and upset stomach. It works by coating the lining of the stomach and intestines, reducing inflammation, and killing bacteria that cause diarrhea. However, it may cause side effects such as constipation, tongue, and stool darkening, and ear ringing. Reference: KDT pg 731",

      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer B - Loperamide Loperamide is the most appropriate to be used for the treatment of diarrhea in a patient who was treated for colorectal carcinoma with 5-fluorouracil. 5-fluorouracil, an antimetabolite chemotherapy drug, can cause gastrointestinal toxicity, including diarrhea, as a side effect. Loperamide, an antidiarrheal medication, works by reducing intestinal motility and enhancing water and electrolyte absorption in the intestine, leading to firmer stools. Thus, it is the most suitable drug for this case. Ciprofloxacin (Option A) is an antibiotic that is used to treat bacterial infections, including diarrhea-causing pathogens. However, in this given case, the cause is most likely due to the GI toxic effects of 5-FU. Therefore, the use of an antibiotic would be inappropriate. Atropine (Option C) is an anticholinergic agent that can be used to treat dysentery and diverticulitis. It is not helpful in this case since the cause is most likely due to the GI toxic effects of 5-FU. Ornidazole (Option D) is an antimicrobial drug used to treat protozoal and anaerobic bacterial infections. However, in this given case, the cause is most likely due to the GI toxic effects of 5-FU. Therefor, thee use of an antibiotic would be inappropriate. Reference: Chemotherapy-induced diarrhea: pathophysiology, frequency and guideline-based management - PMC",

      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: B) Fidaxomicin The above scenario is diagnosed as pseudomembranous colitis. The drug of choice is fidaxomicin, which is highly effective for treating severe pseudomembranous enterocolitis caused by Clostridioides difficile . It specifically targets C. difficile, minimising disruption to the gut microbiome and reducing recurrence risk compared to broad-spectrum antibiotics like metronidazole or vancomycin. Mechanism of action: Fidaxomicin ↓ Binds to the sigma subunit of bacterial RNA polymerase ↓ Disrupts RNA synthesis in C. difficile ↓ Inhibits bacterial protein production ↓ Stops growth and reproduction of C. difficile Metronidazole (Option A) can be used for severe diarrhea associated with C. difficile but it is not the drug of choice. It is used only if vancomycin or fidaxomicin is not readily accessible. Ciprofloxacin (Option C): Fluoroquinolones such as ciprofloxacin can potentially cause pseudomembranous colitis.

        "D": "Stop ethambutol and continue other ATT drugs with uric acid monitoring."
      },
      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: A) Stop pyrazinamide and continue isoniazid, rifampicin, and ethambutol. pyrazinamide , a first-line ATT drug known to cause hyperuricemia by inhibiting renal uric acid excretion, leading to arthralgia or, rarely, gout. Normal AST, ALT, and creatinine (0.9 mg/dL) indicate no hepatotoxicity or renal impairment, and the standard ATT regimen likely includes isoniazid, rifampicin, pyrazinamide, and ethambutol for drug-sensitive tuberculosis. Management of Pyrazinamide-Induced Hyperuricemia and Arthralgia : Mild symptoms : Use NSAIDs (e.g., ibuprofen) for pain relief and monitor uric acid, liver function tests (LFTs), and kidney function tests (KFTs). Hyperuricemia often resolves after the intensive phase (2 months) when pyrazinamide is discontinued. Significant symptoms : Stop pyrazinamide if arthralgia is persistent or severe, continuing isoniazid, rifampicin, and ethambutol, with a possible 9-month regimen to ensure treatment efficacy, per WHO/ATS/CDC guidelines Add allopurinol and stop rifampicin, continuing other ATT drugs (Option B) : Allopurinol is reserved for confirmed gout, which is not indicated by the patient’s diffuse joint pains. Stopping rifampicin, a critical first-line drug, compromises the ATT regimen and risks treatment failure or resistance, making this option inappropriate. Continue all ATT drugs and start colchicine for joint pains (Option C) : Colchicine is used for acute gout, but the patient’s diffuse joint pains do not confirm gout. Continuing pyrazinamide without addressing the hyperuricemia risks worsening symptoms or complications (e.g., gout). NSAIDs are preferred for arthralgia, and colchicine is not standard in this context. Stop isoniazid and monitor uric acid levels (Option D) : Isoniazid is not associated with hyperuricemia or arthralgia, so stopping it does not address the patient’s symptoms. Isoniazid is a cornerstone of ATT, and its discontinuation weakens the regimen. Monitoring alone does not resolve the joint pains.

It increases the absorptive power of the intestine and is approved for short-bowel syndrome treatment. It reduces the need for parenteral nutrition in patients with short bowel syndrome. Teduglutide Type Peptide hormone (GLP-2 analogue ) Mechanism of Action Teduglutide I Binds to GLP-2 Receptors on Intestinal epithelial cells I Activation of Guanylate Cyclase I Increased production of cGMP I Activation of Protein Kinase G I Regulation of Tight Junctions and Epithelial transporters I Enhanced intestinal absorption of fluid and nutrients I Improved glycemic control. Uses Treatment of short bowel syndrome (SBS) in adult patients who are dependent on parenteral support. Benefits Reduces dependence on parenteral nutrition Improves intestinal absorption and transit time Increases nutrient absorption and fluid balance Side Effects Nausea and Vomiting Headache Upper respiratory tract infection Contraindications Gastrointestinal obstruction or perforation Gastrointestinal cancer Special Points Requires subcutaneous injection Dosing and adjustment should be based on individual patient responses. Regular monitoring of nutritional status and fluid balance is essential. Incorrect Options: Liraglutide (Option A) is a GLP-1 agonist primarily used for the treatment of type 2 diabetes and obesity. While it stimulates insulin release and slows gastric emptying, it does not have a specific role in managing short bowel syndrome. Exenatide (Option C) is another GLP-1 agonist used in the treatment of type 2 diabetes. Like liraglutide, it primarily works by enhancing insulin secretion and delaying gastric emptying but does not directly address the needs of a patient with short bowel syndrome. Semaglutide (Option D) is also a GLP-1 agonist, similar to liraglutide and exenatide. While it is effective for diabetes and weight loss, it does not address the specific needs of short bowel syndrome.

      "explanation": "Correct Answer: A) Metronidazole Explanation: Flask-shaped ulcers on colonoscopy are a hallmark of amebic dysentery caused by the protozoan Entamoeba histolytica, reflecting tissue necrosis from the invasive trophozoites in the colon. The first-line treatment for amebic dysentery is Metronidazole. The standard regimen is 400 mg three times a day for a week. Tissue Amebicidal Drugs Metronidazole DOC for all forms of amebiasis Treats amebic colitis and liver abscess Penetrates well into body tissues and fluids, including vaginal secretions, seminal fluid, saliva, breast milk, and cerebrospinal fluid. Effective against Entamoeba histolytica trophozoites but less effective against cysts. Inhibits protein synthesis in Entamoeba Treats giardiasis, trichomoniasis, and anaerobic infections Used in combination therapy for H. pylori infection Tinidazole Amebic colitis and liver abscess Also used to treat Trichomoniasis. Ornidazole Acute amoebic dysentery Secnidazole Emetine Acute amoebic dysentery or amoebic liver abscess in patients not tolerating metronidazole Directly acting amoebicide that kills trophozoites but has no effect on cysts. Side effects include vomiting and cardiotoxicity. Chloroquine Amoebic liver abscess Kills the liver stage of Entamoeba histolytica Luminal Amebicidal Drugs Drug Uses Additional points & S/E Paromomycin (DOC) An Aminoglycoside Luminal agent for amebiasis. An alternative drug for Giardiasis , especially in the first trimester of pregnancy where metronidazole is C/I. Diloxanide furoate Mild intestinal amebiasis Furoate is the active moiety that kills Entamoeba Quiniodochlor Rarely used due to dangerous side effects such as SMON (Subacute myelo-optico-neuropathy) Iodoquinol Contains iodine and can cause thyroid abnormalities and allergy Incorrect Options: Ciprofloxacin (Option B) is a fluoroquinolone used to treat bacterial infections, but it is not effective against Entamoeba histolytica and would not be suitable for treating amebic dysentery . Vancomycin (Option C) is the treatment of choice for Clostridium difficile infection (often presenting with pseudomembranous colitis), not for amebic dysentery . It would not target Entamoeba histolytica . Ampicillin (Option D) is a penicillin antibiotic that does not have activity against the Entamoeba histolytica parasite and is not appropriate for treating amebic dysentery.

      "correct_answer": "D",
      "explanation": "derivative with antidiarrheal properties. It can potentially be abused due to its opioid-like effects, especially at higher doses. To mitigate the risk of abuse, diphenoxylate is combined with atropine, an anticholinergic agent. The addition of atropine causes unpleasant side effects (such as dry mouth, blurred vision, and tachycardia) at higher doses, which discourages abuse of the medication. Incorrect Options: Option A - To correct the side effects of diphenoxylate: Atropine is not added to correct side effects of diphenoxylate. In fact, atropine can add its own set of side effects. The primary purpose of atropine in this combination is to deter abuse, not to alleviate side effects of diphenoxylate. Option B - To enhance the antidiarrheal efficacy of diphenoxylate: While atropine has some anticholinergic effects that might contribute to reducing diarrhea, its primary role in this combination is not to enhance diphenoxylate’s antidiarrheal efficacy, but rather to deter abuse. Option C - To provide an additional antidiarrheal effect: Although atropine may provide some additional antidiarrheal effects due to its anticholinergic properties, this is not the main reason for its combination with diphenoxylate. The primary reason is to reduce the potential for abuse of diphenoxylate.",

      "question": "A 25-year-old woman presents to the emergency department 6 hours after ingesting a large quantity of paracetamol tablets. What is the most likely progression of paracetamol poisoning in this case?",
      "options": {
        "A": "Increase in liver enzymes within 24 hours",
        "B": "Liver failure within 24 hours",
        "C": "Paracetamol achieves peak concentration within 4 hours",
        "D": "Recovery within 72 hours"
      },
      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "poisoning follows a predictable progression based on the time since ingestion . The first 24 hours are usually asymptomatic or present with mild symptoms , but a rise in liver enzymes (AST, ALT) occurs as hepatotoxicity begins. Metabolism of Acetaminophen Acetaminophen is mainly metabolized via phase II reactions into harmless sulfate and glucuronide metabolites. A small portion undergoes phase I metabolism by CYP2E1 , forming the hepatotoxic metabolite N-acetyl-p-benzoquinone-imine (NAPQI) . Detoxification of NAPQI NAPQI is neutralized by binding to glutathione, forming water-soluble mercapturic acid, which is excreted via the kidneys. Glutathione Depletion When excessive NAPQI is produced, or glutathione is depleted, NAPQI binds to hepatocyte macromolecules, forming acetaminophen-protein adducts, causing hepatocyte necrosis. Risk Factors Chronic alcohol use (induces CYP2E1, depletes glutathione). Starvation. Prior use of mixed-function oxidase-inducing drugs (e.g., phenobarbital , INH ). Hepatitis C infection increases the risk of liver injury in overdose. Clinical features Early Symptoms (4-12 hrs) : Nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal pain, shock. Delayed Symptoms (24-48 hrs) : Hepatic injury becomes apparent. Coagulopathy and encephalopathy. Maximal damage seen 3–5 days post-ingestion with aminotransferase levels >10,000 IU/L. Renal failure and myocardial injury may occur. Stages of acute acetaminophen poisoning Stage Time Post-Ingestion Description I 0–24 hours Nausea, vomiting, and anorexia. II 24–72 hours Right upper quadrant abdominal pain; elevated liver enzymes (AST, ALT), and sometimes increased bilirubin and INR if poisoning is severe. III 72–96 hours Vomiting, signs of liver failure; peak levels of AST, ALT, bilirubin, and INR. Possible renal failure and pancreatitis. IV > 5 days Recovery of liver function or progression to multiple organ failure. Liver failure within 24 hours (Option B) is incorrect because severe liver failure typically occurs at 72–96 hours , not within the first 24 hours. Paracetamol achieves peak concentration within 4 hours (Option C) is incorrect because while paracetamol reaches peak plasma levels in 30 minutes to 2 hours , this does not define the course of toxicity. Recovery within 72 hours (Option D) is incorrect because severe toxicity peaks at 72–96 hours , with either recovery or progression to liver failure afterward.

This helps to alleviate chronic constipation and improve bowel function. Incorrect Options: Option A - 5HT2a agonist : Prucalopride does not primarily target the 5HT2a receptors. Activation of the 5HT2a receptors is associated with various effects, including vasoconstriction, hallucinations, and changes in mood and cognition. Prucalopride's mechanism of action is primarily through 5HT4 receptor activation. Option B - 5HT2b agonist : Prucalopride does not primarily target the 5HT2b receptors. Activation of the 5HT2b receptors is associated with effects such as cardiac valve fibrosis. Prucalopride's therapeutic action is not mediated through 5HT2b receptor activation. Option C - 5HT4 antagonist : Prucalopride is a 5HT4 agonist, not an antagonist.

However, it has been withdrawn from the market in many countries due to its potential to cause serious cardiac arrhythmias such as Qt prolongation and torsades de pointes. In the given scenario, the patient has a history of constipation, and erythromycin has been prescribed for the prevention of recurrent rheumatic fever. Erythromycin is an antibiotic that is sometimes used as a prophylactic treatment for rheumatic fever. However, erythromycin can interact with cisapride and increase the risk of cardiac arrhythmias. This is because erythromycin can inhibit the metabolism of cisapride, leading to increased levels of cisapride in the body. Incorrect Options: Option A - Lubiprostone : Lubiprostone is a medication used for the treatment of chronic idiopathic constipation and irritable bowel syndrome with constipation. It works by increasing fluid secretion in the intestines, promoting bowel movements. Lubiprostone is not associated with the risk of cardiac arrhythmias. Option B - Streptomycin: Streptomycin is an antibiotic from the aminoglycoside class. It is primarily used to treat tuberculosis and certain other bacterial infections. While streptomycin can have side effects, including effects on the auditory and vestibular systems, it is not known to cause arrhythmias.

By reducing acid production, pirenzepine helps in the healing and prevention of ulcers in the stomach and duodenum. Incorrect Options: Option A - Asthma: Pirenzepine is not indicated for the treatment of asthma. Asthma is a chronic respiratory condition characterized by airway inflammation and bronchoconstriction. The primary treatment for asthma involves bronchodilators, anti-inflammatory medications, and in some cases, corticosteroids. Antimuscarinic drugs used in asthma target M3 receptors which are found in the bronchioles. Option C - Glaucoma: Pirenzepine is not used in the treatment of glaucoma. Glaucoma is an eye condition characterized by increased intraocular pressure, which can lead to optic nerve damage. The mainstay of treatment for glaucoma involves medications that lower intraocular pressure, such as prostaglandin analogs, beta-blockers, and carbonic anhydrase inhibitors. Anticholinergics are not used in treatment of glaucoma as they cause mydriasis and potentially worsen the condition by blocking aqueous humour outflow Option D - Hypertension: Pirenzepine is not indicated for the treatment of hypertension.

      "explanation": "prophylaxis of motion sickness. It belongs to a class of medications called antihistamines, which can help alleviate symptoms of motion sickness, such as nausea, vomiting, and dizziness. Motion sickness arises from a mismatch between sensory inputs from the visual, vestibular, and proprioceptive systems, resulting in a mismatch in the brain's perception of motion and spatial orientation. Histamine receptors play a pivotal role in modulating the body's response to motion stimuli. By antagonizing these receptors, antihistamines mitigate the neural signals responsible for triggering nausea and vomiting, thereby ameliorating symptoms of motion sickness. Incorrect Options: Option B - Ondansetron: Ondansetron is a medication primarily used for the prevention and treatment of nausea and vomiting caused by chemotherapy or surgery. While it can be effective in managing nausea and vomiting, it is not typically considered a first-line therapy for motion sickness. Antihistamines like promethazine are generally preferred in this context. Option C - Metoclopramide: Metoclopramide is a medication that helps to relieve symptoms of nausea and vomiting by increasing the movements or contractions of the stomach and intestines. While it can be effective in certain situations, it is not commonly used as a first-line therapy for motion sickness. Antihistamines, such as promethazine, are typically preferred due to their specific mechanism of action. Option D - Domperidone: Domperidone is another medication used for the management of nausea and vomiting. It works by blocking dopamine receptors in the gut, which can help reduce the symptoms. However, similar to metoclopramide, it is not commonly used as a first-line therapy for motion sickness. Antihistamines are generally the preferred choice. Reference: Prepladder Notes",
