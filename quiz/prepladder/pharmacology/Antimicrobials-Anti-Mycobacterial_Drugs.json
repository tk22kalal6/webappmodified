      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: A) Bedaquiline Explanation: Bedaquiline Inhibits mycobacterial ATP synthase, a crucial enzyme involved in the energy production of Mycobacterium tuberculosis. By disrupting this process, bedaquiline effectively kills the bacteria. Cross-resistance is seen with clofazimine. It is metabolised by CYP3A4. Hence, rifampicin, a CYP3A4 inducer, reduces its efficacy. Side effects: Nausea and diarrhea (common side effects) QT prolongation The BPaL regimen is a combination of drugs used to treat drug-resistant tuberculosis (TB): Bedaquiline (B) Pretomanid (Pa) Linezolid (L) Levofloxacin ( Option B) is a fluoroquinolone antibiotic that inhibits DNA gyrase and topoisomerase IV enzymes in bacteria. It is safe to use in liver failure, unlike moxifloxacin. Linezolid ( Option C) inhibits bacteria's protein synthesis by binding to 23S ribosomal RNA of the 50S subunit. Side effects include chorioretinitis, optic neuritis, MAO inhibition, and bone marrow suppression. Thiacetazone ( Option D) acts by inhibiting mycolic acid synthesis in the cell wall of Mycobacterium tuberculosis. Reference: 1.

      "question": "A 42-year-old male patient with a history of TB presents for a follow-up appointment. He has been compliant with his anti-TB medications. However, his recent sputum culture results indicate the persistence of TB bacilli. Which of the following mechanisms of resistance is not seen with isoniazid use?",

        "D": "PncA gene mutation"
      },
      "correct_answer": "D",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: D) PncA gene mutation Explanation: PncA gene mutation is associated with resistance to pyrazinamide (PZA) , not rifampin or isoniazid . PncA encodes pyrazinamidase , which converts pyrazinamide (a prodrug) to its active form, pyrazinoic acid . Mutations in PncA result in PZA resistance , not INH resistance. Mechanism of resistance KatG gene mutation (Option A) Encodes catalase-peroxidase, which activates isoniazid. Mutation leads to failure of drug activation. KasA gene mutation (Option B) KasA is involved in mycolic acid elongation and can contribute to INH resistance, though it's a less common mechanism. InhA gene overexpression (Option C) InhA is the target enzyme (enoyl-ACP reductase) involved in mycolic acid synthesis. Overexpression leads to reduced drug binding.

      },
      "correct_answer": "D",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: D) Regular liver function tests required Explanation: Bedaquiline is associated with hepatotoxicity, including elevated liver enzymes (AST, ALT) and rare cases of severe liver injury. WHO, CDC, and IDSA guidelines mandate regular liver function test (LFT) monitoring (e.g., monthly) during bedaquiline therapy to detect hepatotoxicity early, especially in patients with HIV co-infection or pre-existing liver disease, where the risk is higher. This is critical for safe use in MDR-TB regimens. 9-month-all oral bedaquiline therapy regimen: The WHO recommends using a 9-month all-oral regimen (shorter regimen) instead of longer 18-month regimens for patients with MDR/RR-TB and in patients without resistance to fluoroquinolones. (Option A ruled out) Given when the BPaL-M regimen is unavailable. This regimen involves the administration of oral bedaquiline once daily, in combination with other oral anti-TB drugs. Bedaquiline can be used in patients with HIV co-infection (Option B ruled out) Regular monitoring is crucial throughout the treatment period with 9 months of all oral bedaquiline therapy, including assessments of cardiac function (due to the risk of QT prolongation associated with bedaquiline) (Option C ruled out) and liver function (Option D) (due to potential hepatotoxicity). 9-month-all oral bedaquiline therapy regimen Medications Duration Initial Phase: Bedaquiline (6 months) + Levofloxacin/Moxifloxacin + Ethionamide + Ethambutol + Isoniazid (high dose) + Pyrazinamide + Clofazimine Alternative for Ethionamide: Linezolid (2 months) 4-6 months (extend to 6 months if sputum smear positive at 4 months) Continuation Phase: Levofloxacin/Moxifloxacin + Clofazimine + Ethambutol + Pyrazinamide 5 months Reference: 1. https://www.who.int/news-room/questions-and-answers/item/tuberculosis-multidrug-resistant-tuberculosis-(mdr-tb) 2. https://erj.ersjournals.com/content/58/suppl_65/oa1600 3. https://iris.who.int/bitstream/handle/10665/370100/97 89240074286-eng.pdf?sequence=1#:~:text=Bedaquiline%20is%20now%20recommended%20by,of%20all%20ages %20(3).&text=Bedaquiline%20is%20a%20component%20of,longer%20(18%20month)%20regimens .",

      },
      "correct_answer": "D",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: D) Efavirenz Explanation: Efavirenz is an NNRTI that is not influenced by the activation of the CYP enzyme by Rifampin. HIV-positive individuals face an 8-fold increased risk of developing TB and are prone to more severe and potentially fatal extrapulmonary TB. To manage co-infection, ATT is initiated first, followed by ART after 2 weeks to mitigate the risk of Immune Reconstitution Inflammatory Syndrome (IRIS), an exaggerated inflammatory response. Rifampin, a potent CYP inducer in ATT, accelerates the metabolism of certain ART drugs like nevirapine (NNRTI), dolutegravir (integrase inhibitor), and protease inhibitors (e.g., Ritonavir, Indinavir, lopinavir), reducing their effectiveness. However, nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs) and efavirenz can be safely combined with Rifampin. Rifabutin, a weaker enzyme inducer, is often used as an alternative to mitigate drug interactions in ART. All HIV-positive TB patients should also receive cotrimoxazole preventive therapy to guard against Pneumocystis jirovecii infection. Reference: 1.

It achieves this by inhibiting renal tubular secretion of uric acid, leading to hyperuricemia. The patient's symptoms of acute gouty arthritis and elevated serum uric acid levels are consistent with pyrazinamide-induced gout. Pyrazinamide Drug type Prodrug Activation Converted to pyrazinoic acid inside the bacterial cell by pyrazinamidase Gene involved in activation pncA gene encodes for pyrazinamidase, which converts pyrazinamide into its active form Mechanism of action Pyrazinoic acid accumulates in an acidic medium and likely inhibits mycolic acid synthesis by interacting with a different fatty acid synthase than INH. It also disrupts the mycobacterial cell membrane and transport functions. Mechanism of resistance Resistance to pyrazinamide develops rapidly if used alone and is mostly due to mutation in the pncA gene Uses Only to treat tuberculosis Side effects Most hepatotoxic Most potent at increasing uric acid levels Reference: Goodman and Gilman's The Pharmacological Basis of Therapeutics, 14th Edition, Page 1271-1272",

        "D": "Rifampicin"
      },
      "correct_answer": "D",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: D) Rifampicin Explanation: Rifampicin induces the hepatic cytochrome P450 enzyme system, including CYP2C9 and CYP3A4, which are involved in the metabolism of warfarin. Enhanced metabolism of warfarin due to rifampicin can lead to decreased plasma concentrations of warfarin, resulting in subtherapeutic levels and reduced anticoagulant efficacy. Therefore, rifampicin is the antitubercular drug most likely responsible for the interaction with warfarin in this clinical scenario. Adverse effects of Rifampicin: Hepatotoxicity: Risk increases in patients with liver disease and is dose-dependent. Developing jaundice requires discontinuing rifampin, but it is typically reversible. Red-orange discoloration of body fluids like sweat, tears, urine, and saliva (Temporary and harmless) Cutaneous: Flushing, itching with a rash (especially on the face and scalp), redness, and watery eyes. Hypersensitivity reactions: Thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura, acute renal failure Flu-like syndrome: Chills, fever, headache, malaise, and bone pain. Gastrointestinal: Abdominal cramps, nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea. Isoniazid (Option A) , Ethambutol (Option B) , and Pyrazinamide (Option C) do not significantly affect the metabolism of warfarin.

Pediatric Cases Extra-Pulmonary TB Sputum Smear-Negative with Clinical suspicion Drug Resistance Treatment Monitoring MOA: Resistance: Rifampicin resistance occurs due to mutations in the rpoB gene, which encodes RNA polymerase's β -subunit. These mutations alter rifampicin's binding site, diminishing its effectiveness in inhibiting RNA synthesis. Resistance to other tuberculosis drugs like isoniazid often coincides with resistance to rifampicin, causing MDR-TB and extensively drug-resistant TB (XDR-TB).
