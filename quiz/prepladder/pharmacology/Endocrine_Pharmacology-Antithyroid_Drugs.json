        "A": "Propylthiouracil",
        "B": "Carbimazole",
        "C": "Methimazole",
        "D": "I-131"
      },
      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: A) Propylthiouracil EXPLANATION: Propylthiouracil is the DOC in the first trimester of pregnancy since it has less placental transfer. It is contraindicated in 2nd and 3rd trimesters of pregnancy. The uses of Propylthiouracil include Thyrotoxicosis- due to graves disease or toxic nodular goitre Drug of choice in the first trimester of pregnancy. Used alongside I-131 in patients with severe hyperthyroidism to prevent flare-ups from stored T4. Mechanism of action: Propylthiouracil inhibits the production of new thyroid hormone in the thyroid gland. It acts by inhibiting the enzyme thyroid peroxidase, which usually converts iodide to an iodine molecule and incorporates the iodine molecule into amino acid tyrosine. Hence, DIT (diiodotyrosine) or MIT (monoiodotyrosine) does not get produced, which are the main constituents in the production of thyroxine (T4) and triiodothyronine (T3). Peripherally, it acts by inhibiting the conversion of T4 to T3. The side effects include, Hepatotoxicity Hypothyroidism and goitre GI intolerance Skin rashes Joint pains (Options B and C) Carbimazole and methimazole are used in the 2nd and 3rd trimesters of pregnancy; C/I in first trimester. Radioactive I131(Option D) is contraindicated in pregnancy. Reference: KD Tripathi, Essentials of Pharmacology, 8th Edition, Page275,276",

        "B": "Sodium thiocyanate",
        "C": "Radioactive iodine",
        "D": "Potassium iodide"
      },
      "correct_answer": "D",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: D) Potassium iodide EXPLANATION: Potassium iodide belongs to the oral iodide group, which are the fastest-acting thyroid inhibitors . Examples include potassium iodide and Lugol's iodine (5% iodine + 10% potassium iodide solution). Oral iodides Mechanism of action Uses Side effects Inhibits release of T3 and T4 Decreases size of gland Decreases vasculogenesis Preoperatively in thyroidectomy to make the gland less vascular and small Thyroid storm: To prevent further release of T3 and T4 Endemic goitre prophylaxis Antiseptic: Tincture iodine, povidone iodine Acute reaction in patients sensitive to iodine Angioedema, fever, joint pain, petechial haemorrhages, thrombocytopenia, lymphadenopathy Chronic overdose (iodism): Inflammation of mucous membranes, sialorrhea, rhinorrhoea, lacrimation, swelling of eyelids, burning sensation in mouth, headache, rashes, GI symptoms Sialadenitis (mimics mumps) Hypothyroidism and goitre Propylthiouracil (Option A) : PTU inhibits the synthesis of thyroid hormones by blocking the enzyme thyroid peroxidase. It also prevents the conversion of T4 to T3 in peripheral tissues. While it starts to work within a few days, it may take several weeks to see the full effect .It is not the fastest-acting option. Sodium thiocyanate (Option B) : It is used to ablate thyroid tissue and reduce hormone production. Its effects are not immediate Radioactive iodine(Option C) : RAI is used to ablate thyroid tissue and reduce hormone production. Its effects are not immediate; it usually takes months for the thyroid hormone levels to drop significantly after administration. Therefore, it is not considered fast-acting.

        "A": "Papillary thyroid carcinoma",
        "B": "Follicular thyroid carcinoma",
        "C": "Medullary thyroid carcinoma",
        "D": "Both A and B"
      },
      "correct_answer": "D",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: D) Both A and B EXPLANATION: Most papillary and follicular thyroid carcinomas are treated by surgery, radioiodine, and levothyroxine to suppress TSH. However, a small fraction progresses despite these therapies, and systemic therapy with kinase inhibitors may be appropriate in those cases. Radioactive iodine I-131 acts by destroying thyroid tissue (beta rays). It is used for the treatment of thyroid carcinoma, mainly follicular and papillary thyroid carcinoma. Radioactive iodine I-123 and I-125 are used for thyroid scans (gamma rays). Radioactive iodine Mechanism of action Uses Side effects The thyroid follicular cells undergo pyknosis and necrosis followed by fibrosis without damage to neighbouring tissues Thyroid scans Hyperthyroidism due to Graves' disease Hyperthyroidism due to toxic nodular goitre Follicular and Papillary Ca thyroid Highly effective for permanent cure for hyperthyroidism Mainly used for the treatment of hyperthyroidism in older patients and those with heart disease. Delayed hypothyroidism Radiation thyroiditis - Causes release of preformed T3 and T4 into circulation, usually asymptomatic but can worsen hyperthyroidism symptoms, and rarely cause cardiac issues or thyroid storm. C/I in pregnancy Option C: Medullary thyroid carcinoma is derived from parafollicular cells. Therefore, they are not responsive to radioactive iodine/TSH suppression.

      "question": "A 38-year-old female with Graves' disease presents to the emergency department with severe agitation, palpitations, profuse sweating, and fever. On examination, she appears tremulous and diaphoretic with a heart rate of 160 bpm and a temperature of 103.1°F. Laboratory investigations reveal markedly elevated thyroid hormone levels. Which of the following is the drug of choice in this condition?",
      "options": {
        "A": "Propranolol",
        "B": "Methimazole",
        "C": "Dexamethasone",
        "D": "Amiodarone"
      },
      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: A) Propranolol Explanation: The patient is presenting with thyroid storm , a life-threatening complication of untreated or poorly controlled Graves’ disease characterized by exaggerated symptoms of thyrotoxicosis (fever, tachycardia, agitation, diaphoresis, etc.). Propranolol is the first-line treatment for symptomatic control in thyroid storm. It controls adrenergic symptoms (tachycardia, tremors, agitation). It also inhibits peripheral conversion of T4 to T3 , helping reduce active hormone levels. Thyroid Storm Management Drug Mechanism Purpose in Thyroid Storm Propranolol Non-selective β -blocker; blocks T4 to T3 conversion Controls HR, anxiety, tremors, and reduces T3 levels Methimazole / PTU Inhibits thyroid hormone synthesis (PTU also blocks T4 to T3 conversion) Prevents further hormone production Dexamethasone Corticosteroid; suppresses immune response; reduces T4 to T3 conversion Prevents adrenal insufficiency; reduces T3 levels Iodine (after thionamides) Inhibits release of thyroid hormone (Wolff–Chaikoff effect) Blocks preformed hormone release (given after PTU) Methimazole (Option B): Incorrect – Important in treatment but not the initial drug of choice; PTU is often preferred in thyroid storm due to added inhibition of peripheral conversion. Dexamethasone (Option C): Incorrect – Used as adjunctive therapy to reduce T4 to T3 conversion and for adrenal support, but not the first-line. Amiodarone (Option D): Incorrect – Can cause amiodarone-induced thyrotoxicosis , worsening the condition.

His family reports increasing lethargy and confusion over the past week. He is unresponsive to stimuli. Labs reveal hyponatremia and elevated serum TSH levels. Which of the following is the DOC in this condition?",
      "options": {
        "A": "Liothyronine (T3)",
        "B": "Levothyroxine (T4)",
        "C": "Teprotumumab",
        "D": "Cabozantinib"
      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: B) Levothyroxine (T4) EXPLANATION; The patient's condition suggests Myxedema coma, a rare and extreme complication of hypothyroidism with multiple organ abnormalities associated with altered sensorium, hypothermia, dry coarse skin with periorbital edema and bradycardia; it can be fatal. Hypothyroid patients exhibit multiple physiologic alterations to compensate for the deficiency of thyroid hormone. Intravenous levothyroxine (T4) is the DOC. Other measures include, Warming the patient i.v. corticosteroids for adrenal insufficiency Ventilatory and cardiovascular support Correction of hyponatremia and hypoglycemia Levothyroxine(T4)/liothyronine(T3) acts by binding to thyroid receptors. These thyroid receptors are nuclear receptors within the nucleus of cells. The differences between T3 and T4 include, Name T3 (Option A) T4 (Option B) Potency More potent Less potent Bioavailability 100% 80% ROA IV Oral/IV Duration of action Shorter and faster acting Longer-acting Uses Along with T4 in myxedema coma DOC in Myxedema coma (IV), chronic hypothyroidism (oral) Thyroid cancers to reduce TSH Half life 18-24 hours 7-8 days Source 25% from gland, 75% from peripheral conversion T4 is solely produced by gland Note: Liotrix is a mixture of T4:T3 (4:1 mixture) T3 and T4 exert their effect on thyroid-releasing hormone (TRH) by acting on transcription factors. Teprotumumab (Option C) is a monoclonal antibody used to treat thyroid eye disease. It works by inhibiting the insulin-like growth factor-1 receptor (IGF-1R). It is not used in the treatment of hypothyroidism or myxedema coma. Cabozantinib and Vandetanib (Option D) are tyrosine kinase inhibitors used primarily to treat certain types of cancer, such as medullary thyroid cancer and renal cell carcinoma. They are not used for treating hypothyroidism or myxedema coma. Reference: KD Tripathi, Essentials of Pharmacology, 8th Edition, Page 271-273 https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK545193/",
