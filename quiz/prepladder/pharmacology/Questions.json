      "question": "A drug solution containing 500 mg/5 ml of the drug is given to you. You are provided with a 2 ml syringe (having 10 divisions for each ml). How many divisions of the 2 ml syringe need to be administered to deliver 180 mg of the drug to a patient?",
      "options": {
        "A": "1.8",
        "B": "10",
        "C": "14",
        "D": "18"
      },
      "correct_answer": "D",
      "explanation": "deliver 180 mg of the drug, we need to calculate the volume of the drug solution that contains 180 mg of the drug. Given: Drug concentration: 500 mg/5 ml First, we can calculate the drug concentration per milliliter (mg/ml): 500 mg / 5 ml = 100 mg/ml Next, we can calculate the volume of the drug solution needed to deliver 180 mg of the drug: 180 mg / 100 mg/ml = 1.8 ml Since the provided syringe has 10 divisions for each milliliter, we need to determine the number of divisions for 1.8 ml. Number of divisions = 1.8 ml * 10 divisions/ml = 18 divisions Therefore, 18 divisions of the 2 ml syringe need to be administered to deliver 180 mg of the drug to the patient. Reference: .",
