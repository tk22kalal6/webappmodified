It has potent anti-inflammatory and immunosuppressive effects, which can help control this patient's joint inflammation and disease activity. Effects of corticosteroids on the body: Anti-inflammatory effects : It inhibits inflammatory mediators, such as prostaglandins and leukotrienes, and suppresses inflammatory cytokine production. Immunosuppressive effects : Inhibition of immune cell proliferation and function, including T-cells, B-cells, and macrophages Metabolic effects : Increased gluconeogenesis, lipolysis, and protein catabolism, leading to hyperglycemia, insulin resistance, and muscle wasting Mineralocorticoid effects : Promotion of sodium and water retention, potassium excretion, and blood pressure elevation (minimal in prednisone due to low mineralocorticoid activity). Duration of Action Glucocorticoid Potency Effects/Uses Short (8-12 hrs) Hydrocortisone (Option A) Low Physiological replacement therapy, adrenal insufficiency, anti-inflammatory Intermediate (12-36 hrs) Cortisone Anti-inflammatory, rheumatic disorders Prednisone Intermediate Anti-inflammatory, immunosuppressive, rheumatic disorders, asthma, autoimmune diseases. Prednisolone (Option C) Intermediate to Long Methylprednisolone Intermediate to High Anti-inflammatory, immunosuppressive, severe inflammatory conditions, multiple sclerosis.

      "question": "A 28-year-old woman, pregnant with twins, is hospitalised at 30 weeks with PPROM. To reduce the risk of respiratory distress syndrome (RDS) in preterm infants, the obstetrician decides to administer corticosteroids. Which corticosteroid regimen is recommended to promote fetal lung maturity?",

      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "corticosteroid administration has significantly reduced the risk of respiratory distress syndrome (RDS), intraventricular hemorrhage (IVH), and neonatal mortality in preterm infants. The optimal time for administration is between 24 hours and 7 days before delivery, allowing for sufficient time for the corticosteroids to stimulate surfactant production in the fetal lungs. The recommended corticosteroid regimen for promoting surfactant maturation in preterm pregnancies is Betamethasone 12 mg IM every 24 hours for a total of 2 doses. (OR) Dexamethasone 6 mg IM every 12 hours for a total of 4 doses (Option B) Betamethasone and Dexamethasone are the preferred corticosteroids due to their potency, minimal mineralocorticoid activity, and ability to cross the placenta effectively. Hydrocortisone (Option C) and Methylprednisolone (Option D) single dose are not recommended regimens for promoting surfactant maturation in preterm pregnancies.

      },
      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "Correct answer: A) Hydrocortisone Explanation: The patient's hyponatremia, hyperkalemia, and metabolic acidosis are likely due to a lack of mineralocorticoid activity, resulting in impaired sodium reabsorption and potassium excretion in the kidneys. The clinical presentation and investigations indicate adrenal insufficiency, particularly mineralocorticoid deficiency. Hydrocortisone, a synthetic glucocorticoid, has both glucocorticoid and mineralocorticoid effects. Hence, it is the drug of choice in acute adrenal insufficiency. It can substitute for deficient endogenous cortisol, which maintains homeostasis. The recommended dose is 10-12 mg/m2/day, with an initial bolus of 100 mg followed by 200mg over 24 hours. Fludrocortisone (Option B) , a mineralocorticoid that can replace deficient aldosterone. It is also used in adrenal insufficiency, but synthetic cortisol must be given in acute emergency settings when hemodynamic instability occurs. Spironolactone (Option C) is an aldosterone receptor antagonist used in treating hyperaldosteronism and heart failure but not appropriate for mineralocorticoid deficiency. Dexamethasone (Option D) is a potent, long-acting synthetic glucocorticoid. However, it has only a glucocorticoid effect and no mineralocorticoid effect, so it is not the first-line agent.

Hormone replacement therapy with estrogen(Option A) It is the first-line treatment for managing hot flashes in postmenopausal women. Effective for controlling symptoms like hot flashes, body aches, and vaginal dryness. Used to prevent postmenopausal osteoporosis, fractures, and cardiovascular events. Contraindicated in : History of breast cancer or current breast cancer. History of endometrial cancer. History of recurrent thromboembolism due to increased risk of thromboembolic events.

It serves as a non-hormonal alternative for women unable to use estrogen, especially those with a history of hormone-sensitive breast cancers or recurrent thromboembolism. It is generally less effective than hormonal therapies and some non-hormonal options like SSRIs.
