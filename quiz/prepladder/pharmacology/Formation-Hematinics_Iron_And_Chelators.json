      },
      "correct_answer": "D",
      "explanation": "Correct answer: D) Allergy testing is not required before administration. Explanation: Allergy testing needed before iron dextran due to severe adverse reactions risk. More prone to hypersensitivity reactions than newer formulations. Not recommended for patients with rheumatoid arthritis or connective tissue diseases. Indications for parenteral iron therapy: Intolerance to oral iron (e.g., severe GI upset) Inability to absorb oral iron (e.g., malabsorption syndromes) Non-compliance with oral iron therapy Severe iron deficiency anemia with chronic bleeding Need for rapid iron repletion (e.g., CKD patients on erythropoietin therapy) Parenteral Iron Formulation & ROA Anaphylaxis Risk Uses Disadvantages Iron dextran (IV, IM) Yes Useful for patients with chronic gastrointestinal blood loss. Subcutaneous fat staining with IM injections (Z-track technique helps prevent staining) Allergy testing required before administration Not preferred in rheumatoid arthritis or connective tissue diseases Iron sorbitol citrate (IM) Yes Iron sucrose (IV) No Safer than iron dextran. Indicated for anemia in patients with kidney disease. Total dose IV infusion not possible Reports of kidney damage exist Avoid oral iron concurrently and for 5 days after the last injection. Ferric gluconate (IV) No About 80% is delivered to transferrin within 24 hours Safer than iron dextran Parenteral Iron Dose Calculation: The Ganzoni formula can be used to calculate the total iron dose needed for a patient: Total iron dose = Weight (kg) x [15 - Current Hb (g/dL)] x 2.4 + 500 (to replenish stores) Where: Hb deficit = 15 - Current Hb (g/dL) Reference: Goodman and Gilman's- The Pharmacological Basis of Therapeutics, 14th Edition, Page 910 - 911",

      "question": "A 55-year-old male patient with CKD presents complaining of persistent fatigue and weakness. Labs reveal anaemia. After assessing the patient's medical history and conducting further investigations, the physician decides to prescribe an erythropoiesis-stimulating agent to manage the anaemia associated with CKD. Which of the following is the longest-acting erythropoietin analogue?",
      "options": {
        "A": "Epoetin alfa",
        "B": "Darbepoetin",
        "C": "Peginesatide",
        "D": "Daprodustat"
      },
      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Correct answer: C) Peginesatide Explanation: Peginesatide is a synthetic erythropoiesis-stimulating agent (ESA) , specifically designed with a long half-life, allowing once-monthly dosing . It is a pegylated peptide that binds to and activates the erythropoietin receptor like erythropoietin, stimulating red blood cell production. It is used particularly in anemia of chronic kidney disease (CKD) patients on dialysis. Comparison of erythropoiesis-stimulating agents: Drug Type Dosing Frequency Half-life Epoetin alfa Recombinant human EPO 1–3 times/week ~8 hours (IV), ~24 h (SC) Darbepoetin Modified EPO with added sialic acid Weekly to biweekly ~21–49 hours (SC) Peginesatide Pegylated synthetic EPO receptor agonist Once monthly (longest-acting) ~130 hours Daprodustat Oral HIF-PH inhibitor (not EPO analog) Daily oral ~3–5 hours Epoetin alfa (Option A): Incorrect- short-acting, requires frequent dosing (multiple times per week). Darbepoetin (Option B): Incorrect - longer-acting than epoetin but shorter than peginesatide; used weekly or biweekly. Daprodustat (Option D): Incorrect- not an EPO analogue; it’s a HIF prolyl hydroxylase inhibitor that increases endogenous EPO production.

        "A": "Romiplostim",
        "B": "Eltrombopag",
        "C": "Erythropoietin",
        "D": "IV IG (Intravenous Immunoglobulin)"
      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Correct answer: B) Eltrombopag Explanation: Eltrombopag is a thrombopoietin receptor agonist that stimulates megakaryocyte proliferation and differentiation, thereby increasing platelet production. It is specifically approved for thrombocytopenia in chronic liver disease patients undergoing invasive procedures like liver biopsy . Platelet counts below 50,000/µL are a contraindication to liver biopsy without intervention; eltrombopag helps temporarily raise platelet counts to safer levels. Management of thrombocytopenia in chronic liver disease Parameter Details Common cause Hypersplenism and decreased thrombopoietin due to liver dysfunction Risk in biopsy Bleeding risk increased if platelets < 50,000/µL Preferred drug Eltrombopag (oral) or Lusutrombopag , both raise platelet count Onset of action ~10–14 days; used pre-procedure Use Temporary elevation before high-risk procedures Eltrombopag (Option B): Correct . Approved for thrombocytopenia in chronic liver disease before surgery. Erythropoietin (Option C): Incorrect. Stimulates RBC production, not platelets. IVIG (Option D): Incorrect. Used in immune thrombocytopenia (ITP) for rapid increase, not effective or approved for liver disease–related thrombocytopenia.

      "question": "A 35-year-old female presents with symptoms of fatigue, pallor, and shortness of breath. Laboratory tests reveal a haemoglobin level of 9 g/dL and microcytic hypochromic red blood cells, consistent with iron deficiency anemia. She is prescribed oral ferrous sulfate. What is the earliest sign that indicates a positive response to iron therapy?",
      "options": {
        "A": "An increase in serum ferritin levels",
        "B": "A rise in haemoglobin levels",
        "C": "An increase in reticulocyte count",
        "D": "Improvement in symptoms of fatigue"
      },
      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Correct answer: C) An increase in reticulocyte count Explanation: Early response to iron therapy: Increased reticulocyte count within days to a week. Reticulocytes rise as bone marrow produces more red blood cells. Oral Iron Characteristic Information Factors Increasing Absorption Best in acidic environment, take on empty stomach Taking iron with vitamin C increases absorption Factors Decreasing Absorption PPIs and antacids lowers absorption Tetracycline binds to iron, reducing absorption Food, tea, coffee contain phytates and tannins that decrease iron absorption Calcium reduces iron absorption by forming insoluble complexes with non-heme iron in the intestine, Side Effects Nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, constipation Black stools and tongue indicate regular iron intake Indications for Parenteral Iron Severe GI irritation or poor compliance: Start parenteral iron Iron Content of Preparations Ferrous sulfate (most common, DOC for iron deficiency anemia): 32% iron. Ferrous gluconate : 12% iron. Ferrous fumarate (maximum iron content): 33% iron. Ferrous sulfate hydrate : 20% iron. Ferrous ascorbate - new preparation containing Vitamin C ( ↑ iron absorption) Earliest Response to Therapy Increase in reticulocyte count: Earliest response to iron therapy Hemoglobin levels increase by 0.5-1% per week in microcytic anemia Oral and parenteral iron equally effective for treating iron deficiency anemia An increase in serum ferritin levels (Option A): Incorrect. Ferritin increases later , after iron stores begin to refill. A rise in haemoglobin levels (Option B): Incorrect. Hemoglobin starts rising after 1–2 weeks , not the earliest indicator. Improvement in symptoms of fatigue (Option D): Incorrect. Symptomatic relief occurs after several days to weeks .

      },
      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "Correct answer: A) 1-A, 2-B, 3-E, 4-C, 5-D Explanation: Chelators form stable complexes with metallic ions, used mainly in heavy metal poisonings. They bind to toxic metals, preventing interaction with essential biomolecules. Chelation involves ring structure formation within the molecule. Effective chelating agents possess several key properties: Higher affinity for toxic metals: Must outcompete body ligands for binding. Greater affinity for toxic metals than calcium: Crucial due to calcium abundance in plasma. Appropriate distribution: Aligns with target metal distribution in the body. Water solubility: Essential for effective chelation and excretion. Chelator Uses Other Information Dimercaprol (BAL) Arsenic poisoning Mercury poisoning Gold poisoning Bismuth poisoning Nickel poisoning Antimony poisoning Lead poisoning (as adjuvant to Calcium Disodium EDTA) Wilson's disease (as adjuvant to Penicillamine) C/I in iron and cadmium poisoning because the complexes are toxic. Calcium Disodium EDTA Lead poisoning Zinc poisoning Copper poisoning Manganese poisoning Cadmium poisoning Radioactive metal poisoning DOC for Manganese, lead, Cadmium poisoning Not effective in mercury poisoning due to mercury's tight binding and localization in deep tissues (inaccessible) Doesn't enter brain or CSF, removes toxic metals from accessible sites only. Penicillamine Wilson's disease Copper poisoning Mercury poisoning Lead poisoning (as adjuvant to Calcium Disodium EDTA) Cystinuria and cystine stones Scleroderma DOC for copper poisoning Alternative drug to dimercaprol/succimer for mercury poisoning. Desferoxamine Acute iron poisoning Transfusion siderosis Given parenterally. Not preferred in chronic iron overload (Deferiprone is preferred) Deferiprone Iron poisoning Transfusion siderosis in thalassemia patients Oral drug. Less effective than deferoxamine for iron overload due to repeated blood transfusion. Dimercaptosuccinic acid (Succimer) Arsenic poisoning Mercury poisoning Lead poisoning May chelate some essential metals like copper and zinc.

      "question": "Which of the following does not reduce oral iron absorption?",
      "options": {
        "A": "Tea",
        "B": "Coffee",
        "C": "Pantoprazole",
        "D": "Amla"
      },
      "correct_answer": "D",
      "explanation": "IIIIIII Correct answer: D) Amla Explanation: Amla (Vitamin C) : Vitamin C (ascorbic acid) enhances iron absorption by reducing ferric iron (Fe3+) to ferrous iron (Fe2+), which is more readily absorbed in the gastrointestinal tract. This makes Amla (Vitamin C) beneficial for iron absorption. Non-heme iron in food is primarily found in the ferric state (Fe3+), which needs to be converted to the ferrous state (Fe2+) to be absorbed effectively. Iron salts have low solubility at the neutral pH of the small intestine, but in the stomach's acidic environment, iron dissolves and attaches to a protein carrier. Vitamin C releases iron from the carrier, creates soluble iron-ascorbate complexes, and converts ferric iron (Fe3+) to the more absorbable ferrous iron (Fe2+). Tea (Option A) contains tannins that bind to iron, forming insoluble complexes that cannot be absorbed by the body. Thus, tea reduces iron absorption. Coffee (Option B) contains polyphenols that inhibit iron absorption by binding to iron and forming insoluble complexes. Pantoprazole (Option C) is a proton pump inhibitor (PPI) that reduces stomach acidity. An acidic environment in the stomach is crucial for iron absorption, and by reducing stomach acid, pantoprazole decreases iron absorption.
