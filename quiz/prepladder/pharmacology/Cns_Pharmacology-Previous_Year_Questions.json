      "question": "A psychiatric patient was started on lithium for the management of bipolar disorder. To monitor the blood lithium levels, at what time interval should the blood sample be collected after the administration of lithium tablets?",
      "options": {
        "A": "After 24 hours",
        "B": "After 12 hours",
        "C": "After 6 hours",
        "D": "Immediately after taking tablets"
      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer B - After 12 hours Monitoring blood lithium levels is crucial to ensure the therapeutic effectiveness and safety of lithium treatment in patients with bipolar disorder. After taking lithium tablets orally, the drug requires time to be absorbed, distributed, and reach a steady-state concentration in the blood. Consequently, blood samples for monitoring lithium levels are generally taken approximately 12 hours after the last dose. Measuring lithium levels 12 hours after administration provides an accurate assessment of the drug's concentration, enabling healthcare providers to adjust the dosage if necessary. After 24 hours (Option A): Collecting a blood sample 24 hours after administering lithium may lead to inaccurate lithium level readings. By this time, the drug could have been metabolized and eliminated to a considerable degree, resulting in a sample that no longer reflects the therapeutic concentration. After 6 hours (Option C): Drawing a blood sample just 6 hours after lithium administration may not provide an accurate measurement of its levels. At this point, the drug may not have reached its peak concentration, and the sample may not accurately reflect the steady-state levels needed for proper monitoring. Immediately after taking tablets (Option D): Taking a blood sample immediately after administering lithium would not provide an accurate representation of the drug's concentration in the bloodstream. The drug requires time to be absorbed and distributed before it reaches its peak concentration.

      "question": "Which medication could potentially cause constipation, blurred vision, and dry mouth in a 70-year-old patient with a history of schizophrenia receiving treatment for drug-induced Parkinson's disease?",
      "options": {
        "A": "Lithium",
        "B": "Pramipexole",
        "C": "Benzhexol",
        "D": "Selegiline"
      },
      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "drug that may be responsible is Benzhexol. Benzhexol, also known as trihexyphenidyl, is an anticholinergic medication commonly used to treat the extrapyramidal symptoms (EPS) associated with the use of antipsychotic drugs such as drug-induced Parkinson's disease. EPS includes symptoms such as tremors, rigidity, and bradykinesia. Benzhexol works by blocking the action of acetylcholine, a neurotransmitter in the brain that is involved in motor control. However, because benzhexol blocks acetylcholine, it can also cause a number of anticholinergic side effects, such as constipation, blurred vision, and dry mouth, which are consistent with the symptoms described in the scenario. Incorrect Options: Option A - Lithium: Lithium is a mood stabilizer that is commonly used to treat bipolar disorder. While it can cause a number of side effects, including tremors and polyuria, the symptoms described in the scenario are not typically associated with lithium use. Option B - Pramipexole: Pramipexole is a dopamine agonist that is commonly used to treat Parkinson's disease. While it can cause a number of side effects, including constipation, the other symptoms described in the scenario are not typically associated with pramipexole use. Option D - Selegiline: Selegiline is a selective monoamine oxidase B (MAO-B) inhibitor that is commonly used to treat Parkinson's disease. While it can cause a number of side effects, including dry mouth, the other symptoms described in the scenario are not typically associated with selegiline use. Reference: Prepladder Notes",

      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Correct answer: B) Hyponatremia Explanation: Carbamazepine and oxcarbazepine are both antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) used in the treatment of epilepsy, bipolar disorder, and neuropathic pain. While most adverse effects of oxcarbazepine are similar to those of carbamazepine, hyponatremia is more commonly observed with oxcarbazepine. Oxcarbazepine causes SIADH by increasing ADH levels, which enhances kidney water retention, leading to hyponatremia . Carbamazepine can also cause SIADH, but it is generally less potent than oxcarbazepine in this effect. All the remaining options are more prominent with Carbamazepine. Adverse effects of Carbamazepine Adverse Effects Description Neurotoxicity Sedation, dizziness, vertigo, diplopia, and ataxia Gastrointestinal Effects Vomiting and diarrhoea occur with higher doses. Acute Intoxication Coma, convulsions, cardiovascular collapse. Haematological Agranulocytosis, aplastic anaemia. Hypersensitivity Reactions Rashes (Option C) , photosensitivity, hepatitis, lupus-like syndrome. Water Retention and Hyponatremia Due to enhanced antidiuretic hormone (ADH) action, it is more common in the elderly. Teratogenicity Increased incidence of minor fetal malformations. Hepatic function (Option D) It is associated with elevated levels of gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase (GGT) -liver enzymes Hypotension (Option A) It can cause hypotension, particularly orthostatic hypotension, due to its CNS depressant effects, it is not very common. Oxcarbazepine, although structurally similar, tends to have a lower incidence of hypotension. Reference: Goodman and Gilman's The Pharmacological Basis of Therapeutics, 14th Edition Page 396",

      "explanation": "elevated transaminases, indicating potential liver dysfunction. Oxazepam is a benzodiazepine that is metabolized solely by conjugation , which does not rely on the liver's cytochrome P450 enzymes . This makes it a safer option in liver dysfunction compared to other benzodiazepines. Midazolam (Option A) is metabolized by the cytochrome P450 enzyme system in the liver. In patients with elevated transaminases or liver dysfunction, the metabolism of midazolam may be impaired, hence it is unsafe in the given situation. Diazepam (Option B) is another benzodiazepine like midazolam. It is also metabolized by the cytochrome P450 system, and in a patient with liver dysfunction, its metabolism may be slowed. Hence, it is not preferred. Alprazolam (Option C) is also a benzodiazepine that is commonly used in mood disorders, but not seizures. It is also metabolized in the liver; hence it is not ideal in given conditions. Reference: Goodman and Gilman's The Pharmacological Basis of Therapeutics, 14th Edition Page 430 NIH Link",

        "D": "Olanzapine"
      },
      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: A) Valproate Explanation: Valproate (valproic acid) is known to have a high teratogenic potential and should be avoided in women who are planning pregnancy. It is associated with an increased risk of neural tube defects (such as spina bifida) and other congenital malformations if used during pregnancy. Valproate (valproic acid) is an anticonvulsant and mood-stabilizing medication primarily used to treat epilepsy and bipolar disorder , which is highly teratogenic and is contraindicated in pregnancy and in women of childbearing age. Lithium (Option B) is also associated with some risks, particularly cardiac malformations (like Ebstein's anomaly, about 1 in 1000, a rare congenital heart defect). However, the risk of teratogenicity is lower compared to valproate. Oxcarbazepine (Option C) is an anticonvulsant medication that is sometimes used to treat bipolar disorder. It is not known to be highly teratogenic, but there is limited data on its safety during pregnancy. It is generally considered to be safer than valproate and lithium. Olanzapine (Option D) is an atypical antipsychotic that is generally considered to have a lower teratogenic risk compared to mood stabilizers like valproate.

        "A": "This action can be reversed by phenylephrine",
        "B": "It cannot be reversed by levallorphan",
        "C": "It is caused by activation of the Edinger- Westphal nucleus",
        "D": "Tolerance develops due to long-term use"
      },
      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: C) It is caused by activation of the Edinger- Westphal nucleus Explanation: The question states that the patient was an addict and intoxicated, the image given shows pupil constriction (miosis), which suggests that the patient was intoxicated with opioids. The Edinger-Westphal nucleus in the midbrain is part of this system, controlling pupil constriction and lens accommodation. The Edinger-Westphal pathway is a part of the oculomotor nerve (cranial nerve III) pathway, and it plays a central role in the pupillary light reflex and accommodation reflex . Opioids such as morphine, fentanyl, and heroin can activate the mu-opioid receptors in the EW nucleus , resulting in the release of acetylcholine (ACh) , a neurotransmitter that stimulates the pupillary sphincter muscle. In addition to the EW nucleus, opioids can also activate mu-opioid receptors in other parts of the brainstem, which can further contribute to respiratory depression, sedation, and analgesia. This action can be reversed by phenylephrine (Option A): Phenylephrine is an alpha-1 adrenergic agonist that causes mydriasis (pupil dilation) by stimulating the sympathetic nervous system. It can dilate the pupils in certain conditions, but it would not reverse miosis caused by opioid intoxication or other parasympathetic activation. It cannot be reversed by levallorphan (Option B): Levallorphan is an opioid antagonist similar to naloxone, and it can reverse opioid-induced effects such as miosis. However, it is not commonly used in clinical practice because it has a shorter duration of action than naloxone and can cause withdrawal symptoms in individuals who are physically dependent on opioids. Tolerance develops due to long-term use (Option D): Tolerance can develop with long-term use of opioids, leading to a decrease in the effectiveness of the medication and an increased risk of overdose.",

      "question": "The parents of a 9-year-old girl have noticed their daughter often staring blankly, which is sometimes associated with chewing movements. There were also complaints of daydreaming and a decline in school performance. During the episodes, she did not have a problem with maintaining posture, nor were there generalised tonic and clonic movements. The child's EEG is given below.

        "C": "Sodium valproate",
        "D": "Clonazepam"
      },
      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer C - Sodium valproate The symptoms described (blank staring, chewing movements, daydreaming, and EEG findings) are consistent with absence seizures , a type of generalised seizure. Sodium valproate is a first-line agent for treating absence seizures. It works by increasing the availability of neurotransmitters and stabilizing the electrical activity in the brain. Absence Seizures: They are generally seen in children aged 5 to 15 years. A classic EEG finding of a 3-Hz spike and wave discharges is found. Ethosuximide is the drug of choice in typical absence seizures. It blocks T-type calcium channels in the thalamus and prevents the firing of action potential to the cortex. Valproate is the DOC in atypical absence seizures. Phenytoin (Option B) and Carbamazepine (Option A) are contraindicated in the Absence seizures. Clonazepam (Option D) is a benzodiazepine that can be used for seizures, but it is not typically first-line for absence seizures and is usually used in cases of refractory seizures.

      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer C - Dopamine The symptoms described are characteristic of Parkinson's disease , which is caused by a deficiency of dopamine in the brain, particularly in the basal ganglia. Dopamine is essential for regulating movement and coordination, and its deficiency leads to the motor symptoms seen in Parkinson's disease. Primary Parkinson's disease: Idiopathic progressive neurodegenerative disease of dopaminergic neurons in the basal ganglia. Symptoms: rigidity, bradykinesia (slow movement), resting tremors, shuffling gait Treatment: Levodopa is the DOC in Parkinson’s disease > 65 years The drug is converted into dopamine inside the basal ganglia via dopa decarboxylase.

      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer B - Vigabatrin Vigabatrin is an antiepileptic medication commonly associated with visual disturbances, particularly visual field defects , such as concentric visual field constriction or \"tunnel vision.\" It is primarily used to treat refractory seizures and infantile spasms in patients with epilepsy. However, a significant side effect of vigabatrin is the risk of visual field defects, which can vary in severity, ranging from mild to severe. The mechanism behind this adverse effect involves the drug's irreversible inhibition of the enzyme GABA transaminase , leading to elevated levels of gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) in the central nervous system. Visual field defects caused by vigabatrin are usually bilateral and symmetrical , and they may worsen with prolonged use. Regular monitoring of visual fields is essential for patients on vigabatrin to detect any changes early and manage the side effects appropriately. Anti-epileptic drugs that require ophthalmic monitoring: Drug Ophthalmic side effects Vigabatrin Significant risk of permanent peripheral visual field defects (visual field constriction) and retinal toxicity. Topiramate Potential for acute myopia, secondary angle-closure glaucoma, and visual disturbances such as blurred vision and diplopia. Phenobarbitone (Option A) is an antiepileptic drug that is not typically associated with visual disturbances or visual field defects. It works through a different mechanism and does not commonly cause visual issues as a side effect. Ethosuximide (Option C) is mainly used for treating absence seizures. It is not associated with visual disturbances or visual field defects and is not known to cause such side effects. Levetiracetam (Option D) is an antiepileptic drug generally well-tolerated by patients. While it can cause other side effects like drowsiness, headache, or mood changes, it is not linked to visual disturbances or visual field constriction.

      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "nephrotoxicity in young patients Correct Answer: B) High doses of fosphenytoin cause cardiotoxicity in elderly patients and nephrotoxicity in young patients. Explanation: Fosphenytoin is a water-soluble prodrug of phenytoin used to treat seizures. It is converted to active phenytoin in the body. Fosphenytoin is typically administered intravenously (IV) or intramuscularly (IM) and is preferred over phenytoin in emergency settings due to its better solubility, allowing for faster administration. Toxicity : Symptoms of Acute Overdose: Nystagmus can appear at doses as low as 20 µg/mL . Lethargy and dysarthria manifest at 40 µg/mL . Lethal dose is 2-5 grams in adults. Fosphenytoin carries a black box warning due to its conversion to phenytoin. Exceeding 150 mg of phenytoin equivalents per minute can lead to severe cardiac outcomes , including hypotension and cardiac arrhythmias . Excessive IV infusion (>150 mg phenytoin equivalents per minute) can lead to cardiac arrhythmias , hypotension , and CNS depression . Overdose symptoms include nystagmus , ataxia , and dysarthria . In severe cases, lethargy and coma may occur. Formate and phosphate metabolites can cause metabolic acidosis and hypocalcemia in cases of overdose. Nephrotoxicity in young patients, though rare, may occur due to its systemic effects and renal clearance.

      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer C - Mirtazapine: Mirtazapine , an atypical antidepressant, is generally associated with a lower incidence of sexual dysfunction compared to other antidepressants. It works by enhancing the release of norepinephrine and serotonin. Unlike selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) like fluoxetine (Option A) or serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs) like venlafaxine (Option B), mirtazapine (Option C) has a different mechanism of action. It is generally linked to a lower risk of sexual dysfunction compared to SSRIs and SNRIs. This is because it does not directly inhibit serotonin reuptake, which is believed to contribute to sexual side effects. Instead, mirtazapine primarily works by antagonizing certain serotonin and alpha-2 receptors, which increases the release of norepinephrine and serotonin.

      "explanation": "Correct Answer B - Vertigo and Diarrhoea Lithium is commonly prescribed for treating bipolar disorder. While effective in managing mood symptoms, it is crucial to monitor for potential side effects, including signs of lithium toxicity. A key feature of lithium toxicity is the occurrence of neurological and gastrointestinal disturbances. Vertigo , a spinning or dizzy sensation, is one such neurological symptom, while diarrhea is a frequent gastrointestinal issue associated with toxicity. Side effects of Lithium therapy: Initial Side Effects : Nausea, vomiting, and mild diarrhea ; minimized by starting with lower doses. Common Effects : Thirst and polyuria (excessive urination) in most patients. Fine tremors may occur even at therapeutic levels. CNS Toxicity (as plasma levels rise) : Coarse tremors, dizziness , ataxia, motor incoordination, nystagmus, mental confusion, slurred speech, hyperreflexia. Overdose (Plasma concentration > 2 mEq/L) : Symptoms include muscle twitching, drowsiness, delirium, coma, convulsions, severe vomiting, diarrhea, albuminuria, hypotension, and cardiac arrhythmias. Monitoring : Regular monitoring of lithium levels, kidney function, and electrolytes is essential. Reference: K D Tripathi, Essentials of Medical Pharmacology, 8th Edition, Page 476",

      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "I retention due to opioid use Correct Answer B - CO I retention due to opioid use Opioids like morphine depress the respiratory system by acting on the brainstem's respiratory centers, reducing the respiratory drive and sensitivity to CO I levels. In this case, morphine likely caused respiratory depression, leading to hypoventilation and CO I retention, contributing to the patient's respiratory difficulty. Head injury is contraindicated in morphine usage: Morphine retains CO 2 , increasing ICP which adds to already increased ICP Therapeutic doses can result in marked respiratory depression Interferes with the assessment of progress by causing miosis, vomiting & altered mentation Pelvic Fracture (Option A) : While a pelvic fracture can cause significant pain and may lead to complications like internal bleeding or organ injury, it is unlikely to cause respiratory difficulty in this case directly. The onset of respiratory difficulty shortly after the administration of IV morphine points more toward a drug-related cause. Cerebral Edema (Option C) , which occurs due to brain swelling from trauma, is unlikely to be the cause of respiratory difficulty following IV morphine administration. It typically presents with other neurological signs, such as altered consciousness or increased intracranial pressure, rather than respiratory symptoms alone. Pulmonary Embolism (Option D) : While pulmonary embolism can cause sudden respiratory distress, it is less probable here, given that the respiratory difficulty occurred soon after IV morphine administration. The timing and known opioid side effects make CO I retention due to opioid use a more likely explanation.

        "D": "Its action persists up to 2-3 days after stopping the drug"
      },
      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "respiratory depression Correct Answer A - When used with alcohol, the patients feel drowsy, with chest discomfort and respiratory depression Disulfiram works by inhibiting the enzyme aldehyde dehydrogenase , which is responsible for alcohol metabolism. When alcohol is consumed while on disulfiram therapy, there is an accumulation of acetaldehyde, a toxic metabolite, leading to unpleasant symptoms such as nausea, vomiting, and headache. It may last for 14 days after the last dose of disulfiram. It is an anti-craving drug (Option B) : Disulfiram is not considered an anti-craving drug. It works by causing an aversive reaction to alcohol, discouraging drinking, rather than directly addressing alcohol cravings or the psychological aspects of dependence. It can be initiated even in minimally motivated persons (Option C) : Disulfiram is typically initiated in individuals who are highly motivated to quit drinking, as they need to understand the risks of alcohol consumption while on the medication. It is not suitable for minimally motivated individuals. Its action persists up to 2-3 days after stopping the drug (Option D) : The effects of disulfiram can last 7-14 days after discontinuation. Patients should be counseled about this extended effect to prevent disulfiram-alcohol reactions.

        "C": "Suicidal risk",
        "D": "Sedation being the side effect"
      },
      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer C - Suicidal risk : Tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs) have been associated with an increased risk of suicide , particularly in the early stages of treatment or during the discontinuation phase. This risk is a significant concern when considering the discharge of a patient, as they may have greater access to the medication and could be at higher risk for self-harm. Mechanism of Action (MOA) of Tricyclic Antidepressants (TCAs): Inhibition of Reuptake : TCAs primarily work by inhibiting the reuptake of neurotransmitters, serotonin and norepinephrine , into presynaptic nerve terminals. This increases the concentration of these neurotransmitters in the synaptic cleft, enhancing their effects. Antagonism of Receptors : In addition to blocking reuptake, TCAs also interact with various receptors, contributing to their side effects: Histamine receptors : Cause sedation and weight gain. Alpha-adrenergic receptors : Lead to orthostatic hypotension and tachycardia. Muscarinic acetylcholine receptors : Cause anticholinergic side effects, such as dry mouth and constipation. 5HT receptors: weight gain d/t increased appetite Need for drug monitoring (Option A) : Although some medications, including TCAs, may require monitoring in certain situations, routine drug monitoring is not the primary concern for discharge. TDM is typically used for drugs with a narrow therapeutic index or significant drug interactions, which is not the case for TCAs. ECG monitoring for arrhythmias (Option B) : While TCAs can cause cardiac issues like QT prolongation, routine ECG monitoring is not the main focus during discharge. Any necessary ECG assessments would have been addressed earlier in the hospital stay. Sedation being the side effect (Option D) : While sedation is a known side effect of TCAs and should be monitored, the primary concern during discharge is not sedation. More critical factors, such as suicide risk, need to be considered when planning discharge. Reference: Goodman and Gilman's The Pharmacological Basis of Therapeutics, 14th Edition, Page 291",

Absence seizures: Absence seizures, also called petit mal seizures, are a type of generalized seizure that involves a brief loss of consciousness or awareness. These seizures usually last only a few seconds and are marked by a sudden interruption of activity, blank staring, and subtle motor movements like blinking or lip-smacking. Ethosuximide (C) is the drug of choice in typical absence seizures. It blocks T-type calcium channels in the thalamus and prevents the firing of action potential to the cortex. Valproate (B) is the DOC in atypical absence seizures. Phenytoin and Carbamazepine (A) are contraindicated in the absence seizures. Gabapentin (D) is an antiepileptic drug that is primarily used to treat focal seizures and neuropathic pain. While it may have some efficacy in certain types of generalized seizures, it is not typically considered a first-line treatment for absence seizures.

      "explanation": "Correct Answer: A) Morphine Explanation: The drug which is likely to have aggravated the patient’s symptoms is Morphine. Morphine/opioids are generally not advised for colicky pain due to the following reasons: Morphine constricts the sphincter of Oddi, leading to increased pressure in the common bile duct. Pressure can increase more than tenfold within 15 minutes of morphine administration. Increased pressure may worsen biliary colic symptoms, causing epigastric distress and severe pain. Pethidine can be used as it causes lesser spasms of the sphincter of Oddi. Diclofenac (Option B), which is a non-opioid analgesic such as may be considered an alternative option for pain relief in these patients as it does not cause contraction of the sphincter of Oddi and can provide adequate pain relief. Nefopam (Option C) is a centrally acting analgesic with muscle relaxant properties and is not known to cause sphincter Oddi contraction. However, it is not typically the first choice for managing biliary colic. Etoricoxib (Option D) is a selective COX-2 inhibitor that can be considered as an alternative option for pain relief as it does not cause contraction of the sphincter of Oddi.

Lithium is used as first-line treatment for bipolar disorder. Fasting can significantly affect the lithium levels in the blood, as decreased food intake and altered electrolyte balance can lead to changes in lithium absorption and excretion. Lithium toxicity symptoms: Seizures, coarse tremors, confusion, and weakness of limbs Grade Serum lithium (mEq/L) Symptoms Mild 1.5 - 2.5 Nausea, vomiting, tremor, fatigue Moderate 2.5 - 3.5 Confusion, agitation, delirium, tachycardia, hypertonia Severe > 3.5 Seizures, hyperthermia, hypotension, Coma Causes: Dose-related toxicity: Taking a higher dose of lithium than prescribed or recommended can increase the risk of toxicity. II Impaired renal function: Lithium is primarily excreted by the kidneys, so any impairment in renal function can lead to reduced clearance of lithium from the body Dehydration or electrolyte imbalances, seen in prolonged fasting, excessive sweating, or gastrointestinal disturbances, can disrupt the balance of lithium in the body and increase the risk of toxicity. II Age and individual factors: Older adults and individuals with certain medical conditions, such as cardiovascular disease, may be more susceptible to lithium Serum potassium levels (Option A) can help detect hypokalemia or hyperkalemia, which can cause muscle weakness and arrhythmias but are not directly linked to lithium toxicity or fasting-induced seizures. ECG (Option C) can help evaluate arrhythmias caused by hyperkalemia or other metabolic disturbances, but it does not directly confirm lithium toxicity. MRI (Option D) could assess structural or neurological causes of seizures but is not a first-line investigation in this clinical scenario.

      "explanation": "Correct Answer D - Hemodialysis is not useful in lithium overdose Hemodialysis is useful in Lithium overdose. Hemodialysis can effectively treat severe lithium toxicity, as it can rapidly remove lithium from the bloodstream. Lithium Mechanism of action Increase the level of amine (if the mood is low) by inhibiting the Glycogen synthase kinase-3 enzyme Decrease the level of amine (if the mood is high) Inhibits inositol monophosphatase enzyme Inhibits the release of amines Stabilises neuronal membrane Uses Bipolar disorder Hypnic headache (occurs in sleep) Anti-suicidal action (another drug is clozapine) Resistant cases of depression Adverse effects Alopecia and acne Weight gain Seizures and sinus node dysfunction (leading to AV block) Hypothyroidism (hyperthyroidism in rare cases) High doses can cause coarse tremors, ataxia, tinnitus, diarrhea, and seizures. Ebstein’s anomaly: A cardiovascular defect called tricuspid atresia, which has a teratogenic effect (Option A) when administered to pregnant women. Nephrogenic diabetes insipidus (DI) Fine tremors (most common adverse effect) ECG changes: T-wave flattening Leukocytosis Loose stools (diarrhea) Lithium toxicity is exacerbated with thiazide (Option B): Thiazide diuretics, such as hydrochlorothiazide, can increase the serum levels of lithium by decreasing its renal clearance, leading to toxicity, manifesting with symptoms such as tremors, confusion, and renal failure. Lithium can decrease thyroid hormone levels (Option C), resulting in hypothyroidism by decreasing the synthesis and secretion of thyroid hormones. Patients who are taking lithium should have their thyroid function monitored regularly. Reference: Goodman and Gilman’s Pharmacological Basis of Therapeutics, 14th Edition, Page 378-380.",

      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: A) Lacosamide Explanation: Lacosamide selectively enhances slow inactivation of voltage-gated sodium channels, inhibiting high-frequency neuronal firing and reducing seizure activity. Voltage-Gated Sodium Channels: Voltage-gated sodium channels play a key role in generating and propagating action potentials in neurons. These channels open in response to membrane depolarization, allowing Na I to flow into the cell, leading to further depolarization. Fast Inactivation Modulators: Phenytoin (Option B) Carbamazepine Slow Inactivation Modulators: Lacosamide Lamotrigine (Option C) primarily affects sodium channels by inhibiting their ability to recover from both fast and slow inactivation . It is not as selective for enhancing slow inactivation, and while it reduces high-frequency firing, its primary action is broader, affecting both types of inactivation. Ethosuximide (Option D) does not act on sodium channels. It primarily targets T-type calcium channels in the thalamus, which are involved in the generation of absence seizures. It does not directly modulate sodium channel inactivation.

        "D": "Increase dose of haloperidol"
      },
      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: A) Give Benztropine Explanation: Acute muscle dystonia is the first extrapyramidal symptom caused by antipsychotics. It is characterised by brief or prolonged muscle contractions causing abnormal movements or postures, such as oculogyric crises (upward eye rolling), tongue protrusion, trismus, torticollis (neck muscle twisting), laryngeal-pharyngeal dystonias, and dystonic postures of the limbs and trunk. Anticholinergic drugs like Benztropine , Diphenhydramine, Benzhexol and Promethazine can be used for treatment. Extrapyramidal Symptoms Condition Onset Treatment Acute muscle Dystonia Within 1-5 days of starting antipsychotic Administering antiparkinsonian agents such as diphenhydramine or benztropine intramuscularly. Parkinsonism Within 1 month Benzhexol and benztropine (NOT Levodopa) Akathisia (Most common EPS) 5–60 days Anti-anxiety medications DOC: Propranolol (C/I: Asthma) Diazepam Rabbit Syndrome Months or years Antiparkinsonian agents. Amantadine is preferred due to less adverse cognitive effects. Tardive Dyskinesia Late-onset adverse effects (after months or years) Occurs due to D2 receptor supersensitivity and can be permanent, even after discontinuing antipsychotic medication. Stop AP drugs & start Clozapine . If symptoms persist, add Dopamine depleters (VMAT2 inhibitors) Valbenazine Tetrabenazine: DOC for Huntington's disease. Change to clozapine (Option B) : Clozapine is an atypical antipsychotic with a lower risk of extrapyramidal side effects (EPS), but switching to clozapine would not be the immediate treatment for acute dystonia . It should be considered for long-term management in patients who experience severe side effects with other antipsychotics, but it is not an emergency treatment for acute dystonia. Give Fluphenazine (Option C): Fluphenazine is another first-generation antipsychotic (similar to haloperidol). It may worsen extrapyramidal side effects, including acute dystonia. Therefore, it should not be given to a patient experiencing dystonia. Increase dose of haloperidol (Option D): Increasing the dose of haloperidol would worsen the dystonic symptoms and is not appropriate in the setting of acute dystonia.

It has a lower affinity for H1 histamine receptors (which are involved in appetite stimulation) and a high affinity for 5-HT2C receptors. Ziprasidone is often preferred in patients who are concerned about weight gain or who are already overweight or obese . Chlorpromazine (Option A) is a typical antipsychotic that blocks dopamine D2 receptors to alleviate psychotic symptoms. It carries a risk for metabolic side effects like weight gain , diabetes , and hyperlipidemia . Clozapine (Option B) is an atypical antipsychotic that primarily works as a dopamine D2 receptor antagonist , but it also has significant effects on serotonin receptors (5-HT2A and 5-HT2C).

Option C - Topiramate: Topiramate is an antiepileptic drug that has been studied for its potential role in reducing alcohol cravings and promoting abstinence in patients with alcohol dependence. However, it is not primarily used to manage acute alcohol withdrawal symptoms. Option D - Antabuse: Disulfiram is a medication used to support the treatment of chronic alcoholism by producing an acute sensitivity to alcohol.

      "explanation": "Correct Answer: B) Inhibits calcium channels in thalamic neurons Explanation: Ethosuximide blocks T-type calcium channels in the thalamus and prevents the firing of action potential to the cortex. By inhibiting these channels, ethosuximide reduces neuronal excitability in the thalamus and helps prevent these abnormal brain wave patterns, thereby controlling the seizures. It is the drug of choice in typical absence seizures. Incorrect Options: Enhances GABAergic inhibition (Option A): Drugs like benzodiazepines (e.g., diazepam) and barbiturates enhance GABAergic inhibition by increasing GABA receptor activity. Ethosuximide does not primarily act on GABA receptors. Blocks sodium channels (Option C): Sodium channel blockers (e.g., phenytoin, carbamazepine) are effective for other types of seizures, but ethosuximide does not primarily work by blocking sodium channels. Increases serotonin levels (Option D): Some antidepressants and antipsychotics modulate serotonin levels, but ethosuximide's mechanism of action is not related to increasing serotonin.

      "explanation": "Correct Answer B - B The “B” label in the above image indicates the mechanism of action of Sodium Valproate (anti-epileptic drug). Sodium Valproate Mechanism of Action Sodium Channel Inactivation : Prolongs Na+ channel inactivation in a frequency-dependent manner, similar to phenytoin. Calcium Channel Modulatio n: Weakly attenuates the T-type calcium currents, akin to ethosuximide. GABA Enhancement : Increases GABA levels by: Inhibiting GABA transaminase, leading to reduced degradation. Possibly enhancing GABA synthesis from glutamic acid. Glutamate Receptor Blockade : Blocks excitatory NMDA glutamate receptors, reducing excitatory neurotransmission. Uses Seizure Disorders: It is the DOC for atypical absence seizures, myoclonic seizures, and generalised tonic-clonic seizures (GTCS). Mood Disorders: Valproate is effective in the treatment of mania and bipolar disorder. Panic Attacks: It can be used off-label for the treatment of panic attacks. Migraine Prophylaxis: Valproate is considered a second-line treatment for preventing migraines. Mixed Seizure Syndromes: It is used in conditions such as Lennox-Gastaut syndrome. Severe Myoclonic Epilepsy of Infancy: Valproate is also used in Dravet syndrome. Adverse Effects Gastrointestinal: Nausea, vomiting, and indigestion. Neurological: Tremor, sedation, dizziness, and ataxia. Hepatic: Hepatotoxicity (mainly in children <2 years of age).",

      "question": "A patient on fluoxetine was started on a pain control drug for neurotic pain. He developed an episode of syncope after 2 weeks. ECG reveals a QT interval of 477ms. Which of the following is the causative drug?",
      "options": {
        "A": "Methadone",
        "B": "Morphine",
        "C": "Meperidine",
        "D": "Propoxyphene"
      },
      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer A - Methadone Methadone blocks NMDA receptors and is associated with QT prolongation, which can lead to life-threatening arrhythmias such as torsades de pointes Mechanism: It is a full opioid agonist that works by binding to the same receptors as other opioids, providing similar effects and thereby preventing withdrawal and reducing cravings. Use: It is highly effective for detoxification and long-term maintenance therapy. Advantages: Methadone has a long half-life, which allows for once-daily dosing. Effectiveness: It is considered one of the most effective medications for opioid addiction, especially for individuals with a long history of high-dose opioid use. Morphine (Option B) is a potent opioid analgesic used for managing severe pain, including acute pain resulting from traumatic injuries like crush injuries. It works by binding to opioid receptors in the brain and spinal cord, altering pain perception. It is the drug of choice for managing severe pain in an emergency. It is not associated with QT prolongation. Meperidine (Option C), also known as pethidine, is an opioid analgesic. It is the drug of choice in post-anesthesia shivering and involves both opioid receptor activity and effects on the thermoregulatory center in the hypothalamus. It does not cause QT prolongation. Propoxyphene (Option D) is a methadone analog that was used to treat mild to moderate pain. As mentioned earlier, the U.S. FDA recommended the removal of the drug (trade name: Darvon) from the U.S. market in 2010 due to reports of cardiac toxicity (QRS interval prolongation).

      },
      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: A) Trofinetide Among the options provided, the drug approved for Rett syndrome is Trofinetide. Trofinetide is a synthetic peptide used to treat Rett syndrome. It is a synthetic analog of glycine-proline-glutamate, a naturally occurring peptide. The exact mechanism by which trofinetide exerts therapeutic effects is unknown; trofinetide may exhibit anti-inflammatory and trophic effects. It has shown promising results in clinical trials, with improvements observed in certain aspects of Rett syndrome symptoms. Folinic acid (Option B), also known as leucovorin, serves multiple roles in medicine. It is utilized alongside 5-FU in treating different cancers. Additionally, it acts as an antidote to folic acid antagonists like methotrexate. It serves as both an antidote and a modulating agent for chemotherapy, providing support for this class of medications. It is not specifically approved for the treatment of Rett syndrome. L-carnitine (Option C) is a naturally occurring substance that plays a role in energy metabolism. It is commonly used as a dietary supplement and may benefit certain medical conditions, particularly those related to mitochondrial dysfunction. However, L-carnitine is not specifically approved for the treatment of Rett syndrome. Naltrexone (Option D) is a medication primarily used to treat opioid addiction and alcohol dependence. It works by blocking the effects of opioids in the brain. It is not helpful for the treatment of Rett syndrome. Reference: https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10420089/",

      "correct_answer": "D",
      "explanation": "Correct answer: D) Dilutional hyponatremia Explanation: Dilutional hyponatremia is a side effect more commonly associated with oxcarbazepine rather than carbamazepine. Oxcarbazepine has a greater propensity to cause hyponatremia due to its stronger influence on antidiuretic hormone secretion. Carbamazepine Mechanism of Action: Blocks voltage-gated sodium channels to reduce high-frequency neuronal discharges. Indications: Trigeminal neuralgia Generalized tonic-clonic seizures (GTCS) Partial seizures Bipolar disorder Adverse Effects: Hepatotoxicity (Option A): Commonly seen with carbamazepine due to its metabolism through hepatic enzymes. Stevens-Johnson Syndrome (Option B): A rare but severe hypersensitivity reaction, especially in individuals with the HLA-B*1502 allele. Hematologic Toxicity: Agranulocytosis, aplastic anemia, and thrombocytopenia (Option C) . Neurotoxicity: Sedation, dizziness, vertigo, diplopia, and ataxia . Water Retention and Hyponatremia: Less frequent compared to oxcarbazepine. Teratogenicity: Increased risk of fetal malformations (e.g., neural tube defects). Oxcarbazepine: A structural derivative of carbamazepine with a similar mechanism but a better safety profile. Causes fewer hematologic and hepatic side effects.

        "B": "Piracetam",
        "C": "Dabrafenib",
        "D": "Trametinib"
      },
      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) in some countries. It is an antioxidant agent that helps to reduce oxidative stress, which is believed to contribute to the progression of ALS. By reducing oxidative damage, Edaravone aims to slow down the decline in physical function in ALS patients. Incorrect Options: Option B - Piracetam: Piracetam is a nootropic agent that is commonly used for its cognitive-enhancing effects. It is not approved for the treatment of ALS. While some studies have explored the potential use of piracetam in ALS, the evidence for its effectiveness in treating the disease is limited and inconclusive. Option C - Dabrafenib: Dabrafenib is a targeted therapy drug that is primarily used for the treatment of certain types of cancers, particularly melanoma. It works by inhibiting specific genetic mutations that drive the growth of cancer cells. Dabrafenib is not approved for the treatment of ALS and is not considered a standard therapy for the condition. Option D - Trametinib: Trametinib is another targeted therapy drug that is primarily used for the treatment of certain types of cancers, such as melanoma with specific genetic mutations. Like Dabrafenib, Trametinib is not approved for the treatment of ALS and is not considered a standard therapy for the condition. Reference: Prepladder Notes",

      "question": "A patient presented to the casualty with signs of dehydration due to severe vomiting . The intern gave the patient a parenteral medication, following which the patient developed grimacing and abnormal posturing . What could have been the inciting drug of this reaction?",
      "options": {
        "A": "Atropine",
        "B": "Ranitidine",
        "C": "Metoclopramide",
        "D": "Domperidone"
      },
      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "for gastrointestinal motility disorders and nausea, can induce extrapyramidal symptoms (EPS) due to its central blockade of dopamine receptors, particularly D2 receptors in the basal ganglia. This disruption in dopamine signaling can lead to dystonia, tremor, rigidity, and bradykinesia, with characteristic features including grimacing and abnormal posturing. EPS risk increases with higher doses or in susceptible individuals, necessitating close monitoring and consideration of alternative therapies in affected patients, with symptomatic management involving discontinuation of metoclopramide and, if necessary, the use of anticholinergic agents or benzodiazepines. Incorrect Options: Option A - Atropine: Atropine is an anticholinergic medication that is used to treat various conditions, including bradycardia, certain types of poisoning, and as a premedication before surgery. It works by blocking the action of acetylcholine, a neurotransmitter in the parasympathetic nervous system. While atropine can cause side effects such as dry mouth, blurred vision, and increased heart rate, it is less commonly associated with grimacing and abnormal posturing. Option B - Ranitidine: Ranitidine is a medication used to reduce the production of stomach acid and is commonly prescribed for conditions like gastric ulcers and gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD). It belongs to the class of drugs known as H2 blockers. While ranitidine can cause side effects such as headache, dizziness, and gastrointestinal disturbances, it is not typically associated with grimacing and abnormal posturing. Option D - Domperidone: Domperidone is another medication used to treat nausea and vomiting. It works by blocking dopamine receptors in the gut, which helps to alleviate symptoms. While domperidone is generally well-tolerated, it does not cross the Blood brain barrier and thus is less likely to cause EPS unlike metoclopramide. Reference: Prepladder Notes",

      "explanation": "escitalopram. Escitalopram is a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) commonly used for the treatment of depression and anxiety disorders. SSRI's can produce decreased saliva production and dryness of the mouth. Therefore sialorrhea would not be explained by escitalopram use.. Incorrect Options: Option B - Vivid dreams: Vivid dreams or increased dreaming can be a side effect of escitalopram and other SSRIs. Many individuals experience changes in dreaming patterns, such as more intense or vivid dreams, while taking these medications. Option C - Anorgasmia: Anorgasmia refers to the difficulty or inability to achieve orgasm. It is a recognized side effect of SSRIs, including escitalopram. SSRIs can interfere with sexual function and may cause sexual side effects such as decreased libido, delayed ejaculation, or difficulty reaching orgasm. Option D - Nausea: Nausea is a common side effect of escitalopram and other SSRIs, especially during the initial stages of treatment. It may occur in some individuals but usually improves over time or with dose adjustments. Reference: Prepladder Notes",

      "explanation": "method used for the administration of certain medications, particularly long-acting depot formulations. It involves pulling the skin and underlying tissue to one side before injecting the medication into a deep muscle, and then releasing the skin after the injection is complete. This technique helps to create a zig-zag or \"Z\" path for the medication, preventing leakage or tracking of the medication along the injection site. The Z-track technique is specifically used for medications that may cause skin staining or irritation or have a potential for leakage. Long-acting depot antipsychotics, such as haloperidol decanoate or fluphenazine decanoate, are commonly administered using the Z-track technique to ensure proper delivery of the medication into the muscle and minimize skin irritation or discoloration. Incorrect Options: Option A - Administration of nicotine patches: Nicotine patches are typically applied to the skin using a different technique, usually adhering to the manufacturer's instructions for application. Option B - Monitoring of carbamazepine therapy: Carbamazepine therapy typically involves monitoring blood levels of the medication and adjusting the dosage as needed but does not require the Z-track technique for administration. Option D - Monitoring of lithium therapy: Lithium therapy is usually orally administered. Z track is for IM injections. Reference: Prepladder Notes",
