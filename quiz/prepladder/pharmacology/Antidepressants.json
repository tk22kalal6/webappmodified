      "explanation": "anxiety disorder. Mechanism of action: SSRIs block serotonin reuptake in the brain, increasing its concentration in the synaptic cleft. This enhances serotonin signalling, which is thought to alleviate symptoms of depression and anxiety. Uses: Major depressive disorder- drug of choice Generalised anxiety disorder Obsessive-compulsive disorder Premenstrual dysphoric disorder Post-traumatic stress disorder Bulimia nervosa Bipolar depression (using it in bipolar affective disorder can sometimes trigger mania episodes) Side effects: Nausea, vomiting (Most common) Diarrhea Insomnia Anxiety during the initial weeks of treatment Sexual dysfunction (Reduced libido, Anorgasmia, Ejaculatory delay) - therefore can be used for the treatment of premature ejaculation Increased risk of suicide soon after starting drug Bleeding (thrombocytopenia) Loss of weight Benzodiazepines and Serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (Option B and C) are also used to treat anxiety but are not first-line drugs. Benzodiazepines such as lorazepam and clonazepam are used in the acute phase of anxiety. Tricyclic antidepressants (Option D) are used off-label for treating anxiety and are not preferred.

      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: C) Fluoxetine is the shortest-acting SSRI Explanation: Fluoxetine is the longest-acting SSRI. Paroxetine is the shortest-acting SSRI. Option A: Paroxetine is not safe in pregnancy. It is associated with an increased risk of heart malformation in newborns when taken in the first trimester. It can lead to persistent pulmonary hypertension in newborns, especially if used in the third trimester. Paroxetine is drug of choice for premature ejaculation. Option B: Sertraline is safe to use with warfarin. Sertraline and citalopram interact least with warfarin, whereas fluoxetine poses the highest risk of increasing the effects of warfarin. Option D: Escitalopram is preferred in those with heart disease- this is due to evidence that exhibits escitalopram’s ability to decrease cardiac events in the future among those who have preexisting heart disease.

      "question": "A 45-year-old woman presents with widespread musculoskeletal pain, fatigue, and sleep disturbances for the past six months. She describes the pain as dull and achy, affecting various areas like the neck, shoulders, back, and hips, with heightened sensitivity at tender points. After ruling out other conditions, she is diagnosed with fibromyalgia. Which medication is most appropriate for initial treatment?",
      "options": {
        "A": "Venlafaxine",
        "B": "Duloxetine",
        "C": "Vilazodone",
        "D": "Vortioxetine"
      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: B) Duloxetine Explanation: Duloxetine is a serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor (SNRI) commonly used for the management of fibromyalgia. It helps relieve pain and improve mood and sleep disturbances, which are common symptoms in fibromyalgia. It is FDA-approved for the treatment of fibromyalgia and has shown efficacy in reducing musculoskeletal pain and improving the quality of life for affected individuals. Fibromyalgia Details Definition A chronic condition characterized by widespread musculoskeletal pain, fatigue, sleep disturbances, and cognitive impairment (often referred to as \"fibro fog\"). Pathophysiology The exact cause is unknown, but it is thought to involve central sensitization, where the brain processes pain signals abnormally. Clinical Features Widespread pain in areas like the neck, shoulders, back, hips. Fatigue, sleep disturbances, and cognitive dysfunction (fibro fog). Tenderness at specific points on the body. Diagnosis Primarily clinical, based on symptoms and the exclusion of other conditions. There is no definitive laboratory test for fibromyalgia. Treatment Pharmacologic treatment includes medications like SSRIs (Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors), SNRIs (Serotonin-Norepinephrine Reuptake Inhibitors), and anticonvulsants like pregabalin. Non-pharmacologic approaches include physical therapy, exercise, and cognitive-behavioral therapy. Venlafaxine (Option A) : Incorrect because while venlafaxine is an SNRI, it is not the first-line treatment for fibromyalgia. Duloxetine has better evidence supporting its use in fibromyalgia. Vilazodone (Option C) : Incorrect because vilazodone is an SSRI with partial agonist activity at serotonin receptors, but it is not approved or recommended for fibromyalgia. Vortioxetine (Option D) : Incorrect because vortioxetine is a serotonin modulator and reuptake inhibitor used primarily for depression and is not indicated for fibromyalgia.

      "question": "A 9-year-old child presents with a history of involuntary bedwetting during sleep at least twice a week for the past 6 months. Physical examination and laboratory investigations reveal no abnormalities. The child has no daytime urinary symptoms or signs of urinary tract infection. After ruling out organic causes, what is the most appropriate pharmacological treatment for this condition?",

        "D": "Imipramine"
      },
      "correct_answer": "D",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: D) Imipramine Explanation: Imipramine, a tricyclic antidepressant with anticholinergic properties, is effective in treating childhood nocturnal enuresis by reducing bedwetting episodes. However, desmopressin remains the preferred drug of choice for this condition. Option A: Amitriptyline is a TCA commonly used to treat depression and neuropathic pain. While it shares similarities with imipramine in terms of pharmacological class, it is not typically used as a first-line treatment for nocturnal enuresis. It can also be used for migraine prophylaxis. Option B: Amoxapine is a TCA that inhibits norepinephrine and serotonin reuptake and acts as a dopamine receptor antagonist. It is used primarily for major depressive disorder and psychotic depression. It is not commonly used for nocturnal enuresis. Side effect of amoxapine - EPS Option C: Clomipramine is another TCA, mainly used to treat obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) and depression. It is not typically used for bedwetting and can have several side effects, including sedation and anticholinergic effects.

        "D": "Excessive sweating"
      },
      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: C) Urinary retention Explanation: Urinary retention is a common anticholinergic side effect of tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs) like amitriptyline. TCAs inhibit the action of acetylcholine, leading to reduced bladder contractility and consequent difficulty in initiating and maintaining urination. Diarrhea (Option A) is not a typical side effect of TCAs; instead, constipation is more common. Bradycardia (Option B) can occur with TCAs due to their anticholinergic effects, but it is less common than urinary retention. Excessive sweating (Option D) is also a possible side effect of TCAs but is less likely to occur than urinary retention. Side effects of Tricyclic antidepressants: Mechanism of side effect Side effect H1 receptor blockade Sedation, weight gain Anticholinergic action on muscarinic receptors Hyperthermia Dry eyes/mouth Mydriasis (C/I in glaucoma) Urinary retention (option C) Constipation (Option A) Tachycardia Increase in serotonin in the brain Seizure threshold reduction Alpha 1 adrenergic receptor antagonism Postural hypotension Sodium channel block Arrhythmia/QT prolongation Bradycardia in heart block due to overdose (Option B) Reference: Goodman and Gilman, 14th Edition, Page 351 https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK557791/ https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tricyclic-antidepressant-poisoning https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15728327/ https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK430931/",

        "D": "Routinely used to treat depression"
      },
      "correct_answer": "D",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: D) Routinely used to treat depression Explanation: MAO inhibitors are not routinely used to treat depression due to the better efficacy of other drugs and their extensive drug interaction profile. Mechanism of Action: MAO inhibitors inhibit the enzyme monoamine oxidase (MAO), which breaks down neurotransmitters like serotonin, dopamine, and norepinephrine in the brain. By inhibiting MAO, these drugs increase the levels of these neurotransmitters, helping to alleviate symptoms of depression and other mood disorders. Types of MAO Inhibitors Examples Non-selective MAOIs Phenelzine, Tranylcypromine Selective MAO-A inhibitors Moclobemide Selective MAO-B inhibitors Selegiline, Rasagiline (Option C) Uses: Treatment-resistant depression Atypical depression Anxiety disorders Parkinson's disease (Selegiline) - Monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs), particularly selegiline and rasagiline, are used in Parkinson's disease for their neuroprotective effects and can help improve symptoms. Side Effects: Hypertensive crisis: With consumption of tyramine-rich foods (e.g., aged cheeses, cured meats) or certain medications sympathomimetic drugs (e.g., amphetamines, decongestants) (Options A and B) Serotonin syndrome: Can result from combining MAOIs with other serotonergic drugs (e.g., SSRIs, SNRIs), causing agitation, confusion, rapid heart rate, and high BP.

        "C": "Rabbit syndrome",
        "D": "Cheese reaction"
      },
      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: A) Serotonin syndrome Explanation: Serotonin syndrome is treated with cyproheptadine , an antihistamine with antiserotonergic properties. Cyproheptadine blocks serotonin receptors, especially 5-HT2A receptors, counteracting excessive serotonin activity. This helps alleviate symptoms like agitation, confusion, hyperthermia, and autonomic instability. Option B: Tricyclic antidepressant overdose is managed with supportive care, gastric decontamination using activated charcoal, intravenous sodium bicarbonate to counteract cardiotoxic effects, benzodiazepines for seizures, and close monitoring of vital signs. Option C: Rabbit syndrome is characterised by rapid, fine, rhythmic lip movements resembling chewing. It is treated by discontinuing the offending medication (e.g., antipsychotics or antidepressants) and using anticholinergic medications if symptoms are severe. Option D: Cheese reaction (hypertensive crisis) occurs when tyramine-rich foods (e.g., aged cheeses, cured meats) are consumed by those taking MAO inhibitors. Treatment involves supportive care, BP monitoring, and symptomatic management. Intravenous medications like phentolamine or nitroprusside may be used to lower blood pressure rapidly. Avoiding tyramine-containing foods and medications interacting with MAO inhibitors is essential to prevent future crises.

        "D": "Droperidol"
      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: B) Chlorpromazine Explanation: Chlorpromazine, a typical antipsychotic medication, is commonly used to treat intractable hiccups due to its antiemetic and central nervous system depressant properties. It acts on the central nervous system to suppress the hiccup reflex. Option A: Thioridazine is an antipsychotic medication primarily used to treat schizophrenia. It is not typically indicated for hiccups. Additionally, thioridazine is associated with a risk of retinal detachment. Option C: Prochlorperazine is primarily used as an antiemetic in the treatment of violent vomiting and migraine vomiting, not in treating hiccups. Option D: Droperidol is an antiemetic and antipsychotic primarily used for nausea and vomiting. Droperidol, when combined with fentanyl, induces neuroleptic analgesia. It is not commonly used for treating hiccups.

PIMAVANSERIN Mechanism of Action Clinical Use Adverse effects Pimavanserin is a novel antipsychotic drug. Primarily acts through inverse agonism of serotonin 5-HT2A receptors. Does not appreciably bind to 5-HT2B or other monoaminergic receptors. Treats hallucinations and psychosis in Parkinson's disease (PD) patients Alleviates psychotic symptoms without worsening PD motor symptoms Lacks dopamine receptor antagonism, reducing the risk of worsening motor symptoms Suitable for PD patients intolerant to traditional antipsychotics (due to dopamine receptor blocking effects) Carries a black-box warning for increased mortality in elderly patients. Essential to monitor QT interval due to the risk of QT prolongation and potential cardiac arrhythmias. DOC for psychosis in a patient with parkinsonism- Pimavanserin DOC for parkinsonism in a patient on antipsychotics- Clozapine as it primarily blocks D4 receptors rather than D2 receptors, minimizing the risk of exacerbating Parkinsonian symptoms.

      },
      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: C)Associated with decreased appetite Explanation: Clozapine is linked to increased appetite due to blocking the 5-HT2C receptor. There is a significant risk of weight gain, elevated blood sugar, and abnormal lipid levels. Mechanism of Action Atypical antipsychotic with weak dopamine D2 receptor antagonism. Exhibits potent antagonism at serotonin 5HT2A receptors. Blocks 5HT2A receptors more strongly than D2 receptors. Uses of Clozapine Schizophrenia DOC for treatment-resistant schizophrenia. Effective for schizophrenia with suicidality, polydipsia, or persistent impulsive aggression. Mania (Option A) Beneficial as adjunctive therapy or monotherapy for resistant mania. Lower Risk of EPS (Option B) Significantly lower risk of extrapyramidal symptoms (EPS) due to its weaker D2 antagonism compared to typical antipsychotics. Other Uses Used to treat antipsychotic-induced tardive dyskinesia. Adverse effects of Clozapine: Serious Adverse Effects of Clozapine Description Agranulocytosis Rare but life-threatening decrease in white blood cells, requiring weekly monitoring. Discontinue if total leukocyte count < 3000/mm³ or absolute neutrophil count < 2000/mm³. Avoid combining with carbamazepine. Monitoring of agranulocytosis: 1st 6 weeks - weekly; Next 6 months- Fortnightly; After 1 year- Monthly Seizures Dose-dependent seizure risk. Higher than other atypical antipsychotics. Cardiac Effects Risk of tachycardia, myocarditis (fatal, within first 6 wks) and dilated cardiomyopathy. Non-serious Adverse effects of Clozapine Description Hypersalivation (Option D) Known as \"wet pillow syndrome\" due to muscarinic receptor stimulation. Metabolic Complications Significant risk of weight gain, hyperglycemia, and dyslipidemia. Associated with increased appetite due to 5-HT2C receptor blockade. Cataracts Higher risk than other atypical antipsychotics. Effect in Pregnancy and Breastfeeding Can cause decreased arousal and hypotonia in neonates.

Hyperprolactinemia is reversed upon discontinuation of the antipsychotic. Risk of hyperprolactinemia by Antipsychotic Type: Typical Antipsychotics Atypical Antipsychotics Haloperidol - highest risk Butyrophenones - potent D2 blockers with a high risk. Thioxanthenes -lower prolactin risk (least D2 blocking activity) Risperidone and paliperidone - high risk (due to I P-glycoprotein affinity) Pimavanserin and clozapine - lowest risk. Extrapyramidal Symptoms: Condition Onset Treatment Acute muscle Dystonia (Option C) Within 1-5 days of starting antipsychotic Administering antiparkinsonian agents such as diphenhydramine or benztropine intramuscularly. Parkinsonism Within 1 month Benzhexol and benztropine (NOT Levodopa) Akathisia (Option B) (Most common EPS) 5–60 days Anti-anxiety medications DOC: Propranolol (C/I: Asthma) Diazepam Rabbit Syndrome Months or years Antiparkinsonian agents. Amantadine is preferred due to less adverse cognitive effects. Tardive Dyskinesia (Option A) Late-onset adverse effect (after months or years) Occurs due to D2 receptor supersensitivity and can be permanent, even after discontinuing antipsychotic medication. Stop AP drugs & start Clozapine. If symptoms persist, add Dopamine depleters (VMAT2 inhibitors) Valbenazine Tetrabenazine: DOC for Huntington's disease.

      "question": "A 25-year-old man is brought to the emergency department due to severe agitation and aggressive behaviour. The patient has a history of bipolar disorder and is prescribed olanzapine, lithium, and fluoxetine. Temperature is 40.6 C (105.1 F), BP is 157/90 mm Hg. The patient requires several doses of antipsychotics to calm down. Examination shows diffuse rigidity in the upper and lower extremities. Which of the following most likely explains this patient's current symptoms?",

        "A": "Drug-induced parkinsonism",
        "B": "Lithium toxicity",
        "C": "Neuroleptic malignant syndrome",
        "D": "Serotonin Syndrome"

      "explanation": "Correct Answer: C) Neuroleptic malignant syndrome Explanation: Given the clinical presentation of severe agitation, hyperthermia, I BP, diffuse muscle rigidity, and a history of antipsychotic use, the most likely Serotonin syndrome: Feature Neuroleptic Malignant Syndrome (NMS) (Option C) Serotonin Syndrome (Option D) Mechanism Associated with high doses of potent D2 antagonists Mediated by activation of 5HT2A and 5HT1A receptors (serotonergic agents) Associated Drugs Antipsychotic agents (greater risk with 1st generation than 2nd generation) SSRIs, NE reuptake inhibitors, triptans, MAOIs. Onset 1-3 days May persist for more than a week after the offending agent is discontinued <1 day Occur when starting new or increasing antidepressant therapy or combining an SSRI with an NE reuptake inhibitor or a triptan. Common features Altered mental status Sympathetic hyperactivity (eg, hyperthermia, hypertension, tachycardia, diaphoresis) Distinct features Lead pipe rigidity, hyporeflexia, elevated enzymes ( ↑ CK), myoglobinuria Clonus, hyperreflexia Treatment Cessation of antipsychotic, supportive care (e.g., aggressive cooling measures), DA agonist (e.g., bromocriptine), dantrolene, ECT Cessation of drugs, benzodiazepines, supportive care, cyproheptadine (serotonin agonist) if symptoms persist. Avoid simultaneous serotonergic agents. Option A: Drug-induced parkinsonism typically presents with bradykinesia, tremors, and rigidity but without severe agitation, high fever, and autonomic instability. Option B: Lithium toxicity can cause symptoms like tremors, polyuria, polydipsia, confusion, and, in severe cases, seizures, but not typically high fever or severe rigidity.

      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: A) Haloperidol Explanation: Haloperidol belongs to the class of first-generation antipsychotic medications, also known as typical antipsychotics. While effective in managing psychotic symptoms, haloperidol is notorious for its higher risk of causing extrapyramidal symptoms (EPS), which are movement disorders that can occur as side effects of antipsychotic medications. These include dystonia, akathisia, and tardive dyskinesia. Atypical antipsychotics like clozapine (Option B), olanzapine (Option C), and risperidone (Option D) generally have a lower risk of causing these adverse effects.
