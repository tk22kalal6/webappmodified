      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "Correct answer: A) Amoxicillin-clavulanic acid Explanation: Amoxicillin-clavulanic acid would be the ideal option for this patient. Extended-spectrum beta-lactamase is an enzyme that provides the bacteria with resistance to most penicillins, cephalosporins and even the monobactam aztreonam except carbapenems which are effective against ESBL-producing bacteria. Beta-lactamase inhibitors have shown effectiveness against such enzyme-producing bacteria. These drugs should be used appropriately with other penicillins or cephalosporins to act against such beta-lactamase-producing organisms like Klebsiella or Enterococcus . The table below shows the beta-lactamase inhibitors along with their combinations with penicillins/beta-lactams.

      "explanation": "Correct Answer: C) Vancomycin Explanation: The clinical scenario of a patient with severe abdominal pain, watery diarrhoea, fever with a history of recent antibiotic use, and colonoscopy showing pseudomembranes is suggestive of pseudomembranous colitis. Among the given options, vancomycin is the best drug to manage this condition. Pseudomembranous enterocolitis: Cause: Clostridium difficle & antibiotics. Clindamycin. 3 rd generation cephalosporins. Ampicillin. Fluoroquinolones. The antibiotics kill the gut flora, leading to Clostridium difficle superinfection. Management: Fidaxomicin. Vancomycin. Metronidazole. (Option A and D ruled out) For an initial episode of pseudomembranous colitis, fidaxomicin is preferred due to its safety profile and higher beneficial effects. In resource-limited settings where fidaxomicin is unavailable, vancomycin can be used. (Option C) Metronidazole was previously used as a first-line treatment for pseudomembranous colitis; however, it is no longer the preferred treatment due to increasing resistance and higher recurrence rates than vancomycin. (Option B) Other uses of vancomycin: Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus.

      "explanation": "Correct answer: A) Vancomycin Explanation: Red Man Syndrome is a well-known adverse reaction to vancomycin. Vancomycin is a glycopeptide antibiotic with the potential to release histamine by direct action on mast cells through rapid intravenous injection, causing chills, fever, urticaria, and intense flushing, known as Red man syndrome. It can be ameliorated by administering vancomycin more slowly, sometimes with premedication with histamine blockers. Red man syndrome is not observed with teicoplanin. Other side effects of vancomycin: Common Rare Nephrotoxicity (especially with prolonged use or high doses). Ototoxicity (especially with rapid infusion or high doses). Thrombophlebitis at IV site. Neutropenia. Anaphylaxis.

      "question": "A 45-year-old male patient residing in Delhi presents to the emergency department with fever, chills, hypotension, and altered mental status. Blood cultures are positive for a gram-negative bacillus. The patient is diagnosed with sepsis, and subsequent laboratory testing reveals that the causative organism produces New Delhi metallo-beta-lactamase (NDM-1). Given this information, which of the following is the best treatment choice?",

        "A": "Meropenem",

        "D": "Amoxicillin-clavulanate"
      },
      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Correct answer: C) Ceftazidime-avibactam Explanation: Metallobactamase-producing bacteria produce an enzyme called metallobactamase , which can break down and make certain antibiotics ineffective. These bacteria can cause severe infections and are often resistant to multiple antibiotics, making them challenging to treat. Ceftazidime-avibactam is a combination of a third-generation cephalosporin and a non-beta-lactam beta-lactamase inhibitor. Avibactam can inhibit NDM-1, making this combination effective against NDM-1-producing organisms. Meropenem (Option A) is a broad-spectrum carbapenem antibiotic. However, it is generally ineffective against organisms producing NDM-1, as these bacteria can hydrolyse carbapenems and render them useless. Piperacillin-tazobactam (Option B) is a combination of a broad-spectrum penicillin and a beta-lactamase inhibitor. It is ineffective against organisms producing NDM-1, as NDM-1 can hydrolyse a wide range of beta-lactams, including those protected by beta-lactamase inhibitors. Amoxicillin-clavulanate (Option D) combines a penicillin antibiotic and a beta-lactamase inhibitor. NDM-1 can also hydrolyse this combination.

Bacampicillin. Amoxicillin. Carboxypenicillins: Carbenicillin. Ticarcillin. Ureidopenicillins: Piperacillin. Mezlocillin. Ampicillin is now not used in typhoid fever because of the emergence of resistance. (Option A) Ampicillin is partly excreted in bile and also reabsorbed to enter the entero-hepatic circulation.

      "explanation": "Correct answer: D) Continues dose of 24 million IU penicillin G Explanation: This patient's history of untreated painless genital ulcer (chancre) presenting with progressive neurological symptoms along with examination revealing Argyll Robertson pupils suggest neurosyphilis as the most likely diagnosis, which should be treated with a continuous intravenous infusion of 18–24 IU of intravenous benzathine penicillin G.

Previous medical history includes breathing issues and rashes caused by an unknown medicine used to treat syphilis one year ago. A throat swab confirms the streptococcal infection.

      },
      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Correct answer: C) Erythromycin Explanation: This patient with a history of anaphylaxis (trouble breathing and rash) after starting medication to treat sore throat suggests penicillin hypersensitivity reaction and should be prescribed erythromycin due to the risk of cross-reactivity with similar drugs like amoxicillin, ceftriaxone, and penicillin V. Penicillin Hypersensitivity: Incidence: 4-5% This is due to the product breakdown called “ major determinant ” or the penicilloyl moiety. It may occur at any dose and in the absence of a previous exposure. Allergic testing: Intradermal 6-aminopenicillins acid (benzylpenicilloyl polylysine). Types: Type 1 ( immediate ): Sudden death due to anaphylaxis (Purpuric eruption, hypotension, bronchoconstriction and GI symptoms). Type 2: Hemolytic anaemia (Detected through Coombs test), neutropenia. Type 3: Serum sickness (presents after one week and persists after discontinuation). Type 4 (Delayed type): Steven-Johnson syndrome , toxic epidermal necrolysis. Treatment: Discontinue the medication and avoid similar classes of antibiotics (avoid all beta-lactams but monobactam is safe as it has a different structure that lacks the characteristic beta-lactam ring configuration. This structural difference significantly reduces the risk of cross-reactivity with other beta-lactam antibiotics. (Options A, B and D ruled out). DOC: Macrolides (Erythromycin, Azithromycin).

      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Correct answer: C)Intravenous Ceftriaxone Explanation: The young student has classical symptoms of bacterial meningitis (severe headache, high fever, photophobia, and positive Kernig's sign), and CSF findings of bacterial meningitis suggest meningococcal meningitis as the most likely diagnosis. This should be treated with ceftriaxone , a broad-spectrum third-generation cephalosporin with good CSF penetration. Meningococcal Meningitis Causative organism Neisseria meningitidis Treatment DOC: IV Ceftriaxone (Third generation cephalosporin) Prophylaxis Adult: Ciprofloxacin (earlier Rifampicin) Prevents nasal colonisation Children and Pregnant women: Ceftriaxone injection (as Ciprofloxacin ( FQ) causes cartilage damage in children and fetus). Intravenous acyclovir (Option A) is recommended for VZV-associated and HSV meningitis , showing normal glucose, increased protein, and lymphocytic pleocytosis on CSF examination. Intravenous vancomycin (Option B) is advised for resistant cases of healthcare-associated meningitis and ventriculitis but not as a first-line treatment for bacterial meningitis. Intravenous amphotericin B (Option D) plus flucytosine is used for cryptococcal meningitis in HIV patients , showing elevated opening pressure, increased protein, low glucose, and slight lymphocytic predominance on CSF examination.
