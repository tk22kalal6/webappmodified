      "question": "A 55-year-old male presents with complaints of fatigue and exertional chest discomfort. His medical history is significant for hypertension and a family history of coronary artery disease. Physical examination reveals elevated blood pressure and mild obesity. Laboratory investigations show elevated LDL cholesterol levels. Based on his risk factors and lab results, he is prescribed statin therapy. Which of the following effects may not be seen after the commencement of statin therapy?",

        "C": "Increase in uric acid",
        "D": "Reduced CRP"
      },
      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: C) Increase in uric acid Explanation: Statins (HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors) primarily lower LDL cholesterol but also have pleiotropic effects that go beyond lipid-lowering. They typically do not increase uric acid ; in fact, some studies suggest statins may lower serum uric acid . Therefore, \"Increase in uric acid\" is not a known effect of statin therapy . Statins – Pharmacological Effects Effect Explanation ↓ LDL cholesterol Inhibit HMG-CoA reductase → ↓ cholesterol synthesis ↓ CRP (C-reactive protein) Anti-inflammatory effect via reduced cytokine production Antiplatelet action Improve endothelial function and reduce platelet aggregation Mild anticoagulant effect Inhibit thrombin generation and fibrinogen expression Uric acid levels No consistent increase ; some statins may slightly reduce it Antiplatelet action (Option A): Correct – Statins have mild antiplatelet properties by improving endothelial nitric oxide and reducing platelet adhesion . Anticoagulant action (Option B): Correct – Statins have a modest anticoagulant effect , likely by reducing thrombin formation and increasing thrombomodulin expression . Reduced CRP (Option D): Correct – Statins are known to reduce CRP , reflecting their anti-inflammatory benefit in cardiovascular disease.

        "D": "Atorvastatin"
      },
      "correct_answer": "D",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: D) Atorvastatin Explanation: Atorvastatin is primarily metabolized by the cytochrome P450 3A4 (CYP3A4) enzyme. This makes it susceptible to drug interactions with CYP3A4 inhibitors (e.g., clarithromycin, ketoconazole) and inducers (e.g., rifampin, phenytoin), which can alter its plasma levels and toxicity risk. CYP3A4 metabolism is an important consideration for clinicians when prescribing or adjusting statin therapy. Statin Metabolism Statin CYP450 Metabolism Enzyme Involved Atorvastatin Yes CYP3A4 Simvastatin Yes CYP3A4 Lovastatin Yes CYP3A4 Fluvastatin Yes CYP2C9 Rosuvastatin Minimal (10%) CYP2C9/CYP2C19 (minor) Pravastatin No (non-CYP route) Excreted unchanged mostly Fluvastatin (Option A): Incorrect – Metabolized by CYP2C9 , not CYP3A4. Rosuvastatin (Option B): Incorrect – Minimally metabolized by CYP2C9 and CYP2C19; not CYP3A4 .

      "question": "A 58-year-old male on treatment for hyperlipidemia, hypertension, and CAD presents with severe muscle pain and weakness. He reports starting a new medication for a respiratory infection a few days ago. On examination, he appears distressed, with generalized muscle tenderness and weakness. Laboratory studies reveal markedly elevated serum creatine kinase (CK) levels, along with myoglobinuria. Which of the following medications is most likely responsible for this patient's presentation?",
      "options": {
        "A": "Aspirin",
        "B": "Ramipril",
        "C": "Metformin",
        "D": "Clarithromycin"
      },
      "correct_answer": "D",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: D) Clarithromycin Explanation: Clarithromycin is a macrolide antibiotic used to treat various bacterial infections, including respiratory tract infections. Rhabdomyolysis is a known rare side effect of clarithromycin, especially when used concomitantly with statin medications. This happens because clarithromycin inhibits the enzyme CYP3A4, which is responsible for metabolising statins. The interaction between these drugs increases statin levels in the blood, leading to muscle toxicity. This patient's symptoms, including severe muscle pain and weakness, along with markedly elevated CK levels and myoglobinuria, are highly suggestive of rhabdomyolysis secondary to clarithromycin and statin use. Side effects of statins: Myopathy (mild to severe): It can present as muscle aches, weakness, or rhabdomyolysis. Reduced catabolism from drugs such as fibrates, cyclosporine, digoxin, and macrolides, and conditions such as liver disease, kidney disease, and hypothyroidism increase the risk of myopathy. Hepatotoxicity: Rare side effect and difficult to predict. Contraindications to statin use: Pregnancy: Must be stopped before conception Children (Pravastatin can be used in children <8 years old) Used cautiously in renal impairment Aspirin (Option A) is a COX inhibitor used for its cardioprotective and anti-platelet effects. Its most common side effects are hypersensitivity, increased bleeding risk, and Reye syndrome in children. Ramipril (Option B) is an angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor used to treat high blood pressure and heart failure. It is associated with adverse effects such as dry cough, hyperkalemia, angioedema, and postural hypotension. Metformin (Option C) is an oral medication commonly used to treat type 2 diabetes. While metformin can rarely cause lactic acidosis as a severe side effect, it's not associated with rhabdomyolysis or severe muscle pain and weakness, which are the predominant symptoms in this case.

        "A": "Aspirin is used to counteract flushing from niacin",
        "B": "Bile acid sequestrants can be used in pregnancy",
        "C": "Colesevelam is approved for use in T2DM",
        "D": "Niacin reduces uric acid levels"
      },
      "correct_answer": "D",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: D) Niacin reduces uric acid levels Explanation: Niacin increases uric levels and is contraindicated in gout for this very reason. Niacin increases uric acid levels primarily due to its inhibitory effect on the enzyme uricase. Uricase is responsible for breaking down uric acid into a more soluble form that can be easily excreted by the kidneys. When niacin inhibits uricase, uric acid accumulates in the blood, leading to higher levels. Resins (Bile acid sequestrants): Drugs include cholestyramine, cholestipol, and colesevelam. They are used in adjunct with statin therapy. It is safe to use in pregnancy. (Option B) Colesevelam is approved for use in T2DM. (Option C) They may be used off-label for hyperthyroidism treatment. They are used to reduce pruritis from liver disease Niacin: Niacin is Vitamin B3 or nicotinic acid. It inhibits lipolysis in adipose tissue and I triglyceride production by the liver. It also I HDL levels. Its use is limited by its side effects: Flushing- taking aspirin before niacin helps to reduce flushing (Option A) Dry skin Dyspepsia Hepatotoxicity- presents with fatigue and weakness Hyperglycemia- it can indicate insulin resistance and should be used cautiously in those with diabetes Increases uric acid levels- contraindicated in gout (Option D) Reference: Goodman and Gilman, Pharmacological Basis of Therapeutics, 14th Edition, Page 738,739 https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3770072/ https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35499807/ https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK549906/",

      "question": "A 56-year-old male with a history of hyperlipidemia is being managed on a lipid-lowering therapy regimen. His current medications include atorvastatin for cholesterol management. During a follow-up visit, the patient's lipid profile indicates the need for additional triglyceride lowering, and the clinician considers adding a fibrate to his treatment plan. Which of the following fibrate drugs must be avoided in this patient?",
      "options": {
        "A": "Fenofibrate",
        "B": "Clofibrate",
        "C": "Bezafibrate",
        "D": "Gemfibrozil"
      },
      "correct_answer": "D",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: D) Gemfibrozil Explanation: Gemfibrozil is a fibrate that significantly increases the risk of myopathy and rhabdomyolysis when combined with statins like atorvastatin. This is due to its strong inhibitory effect on the CYP2C8 and CYP3A4 enzymes, which are involved in the metabolism of many statins. As a result, it increases the plasma concentration of statins, leading to an increased risk of muscle toxicity. Fibrates Mechanism: Activate peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor alpha (PPAR- α ). Effects: Reduce triglyceride production Elevate high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol levels Decrease hepatic triglyceride synthesis Gemfibrozil (Option D) Gemfibrozil effectively lowers plasma TG levels by enhancing breakdown and suppressing hepatic synthesis. Gemfibrozil appears to reduce VLDL secretion by the liver. Has CYP action, hence if combined with a statin increases the risk of myopathy Bezafibrate (Option C) This second-generation fibric acid derivative is an alternative to gemfibrozil in mixed hyperlipidemias Has the least risk of myopathy. Fenofibrate (Option A) This second-generation prodrug fibric acid derivative raises HDL-C and lowers LDL-C more than other fibrates. most suitable fibrate for combining with statins because it minimally affects statin metabolism as it has no CYP action (less risk of myopathy). Clofibrate (Option B) Clofibrate is an older fibrate and is less commonly used today. Associated with an increased risk of gallstone formation. All fibrates in general increase the lithogenicity of bile. Additional information Clofibrate, bezafibrate, and fenofibrate may increase the effects of warfarin. Fibrates are C/I in pregnancy and children. Hepatic and renal dysfunction are relative contraindications.

Ezetimibe, with statins, enhances LDL-C reduction by inhibiting statin-induced cholesterol synthesis rise. Primarily used with statins for primary hypercholesterolemia. Avoid combining with bile acid sequestrants due to inhibited ezetimibe absorption. PCSK9 inhibitors PCSK9 inhibitors: Monoclonal antibodies block PCSK9 action, promoting LDL receptor recycling and degradation, enhancing LDL clearance. Alirocumab and evolocumab: Lower LDL-C in familial hypercholesterolemia or cardiovascular disease,given subcutaneously every 2 weeks or monthly, complement statins to reduce LDL-C.

      "explanation": "wave, along with his symptoms of palpitations and dizziness. Procainamide is the most appropriate drug for treating WPW syndrome with atrial fibrillation or supraventricular tachycardia (SVT). It effectively slows conduction through both the accessory pathway and the atrioventricular (AV) node, aiding in the restoration of normal sinus rhythm. For WPW syndrome, procainamide is used in combination with propafenone to manage narrow QRS complex tachycardia and in combination with propafenone, verapamil, or propranolol to manage wide QRS complex tachycardia. Lidocaine (Option A): Lidocaine is primarily used for ventricular arrhythmias and is not effective for atrial arrhythmias associated with WPW syndrome. It does not address the accessory pathway conduction issue. Esmolol (Option B): While esmolol is a beta-blocker that can slow heart rate, it is not recommended in WPW syndrome as it may enhance conduction through the accessory pathway, potentially worsening the arrhythmia. Ajmaline (Option D): Ajmaline, a new Class 1a drug, is not used for treating arrhythmias but is employed in diagnosing Brugada syndrome. This genetic condition features defective sodium channels that remain open for prolonged periods. Ajmaline is unable to block these sodium channels in patients with Brugada syndrome, making it a useful diagnostic tool rather than a treatment option.",

      "explanation": "Wolff-Chaikoff effect. It contains iodine and can lead to excess iodine in the thyroid gland, suppressing thyroid hormone synthesis. Mechanism of action of Amiodarone: Prolongs action potential duration and QT interval by blocking delayed rectifier K+ channels. Blocks inactivated Na+ channels,with rapid channel recovery (Decrease phase 0 slope). Partially inhibits myocardial Ca2+ channels, adding to its antiarrhythmic effects. Used to treat both atrial and ventricular fibrillation. Adverse effects: Hypotension and Bradycardia (with i.v administration or after drug accumulation) Photosensitivity : Skin pigmentation - Purple color (purple man syndrome, smurf syndrome) Corneal microdeposits: Reversible upon drug discontinuation. Pulmonary alveolitis and fibrosis (On long-term use) Peripheral neuropathy Thyroid Dysfunction: Interfere with thyroid function as it acts as a source of iodine and can potentially lead to goitre, hypothyroidism (Wolf Chaikoff effect), or, in rare cases, hyperthyroidism (Jod-Basedow effect). Drug Interactions: Inhibits CYP3A4, CYP2C9, and P-glycoprotein, leading to potential interactions with drugs metabolised by this system. Increases plasma levels of digoxin and warfarin. Additive AV block with beta-blockers or calcium channel blockers. Reference: Goodman and Gilman, Pharmacological Basis of Therapeutics, 14th Edition, Page577-578",

      "question": "A 35-year-old woman presents to the emergency department with sudden palpitations and lightheadedness. She has a previous history of MI and her medications include a beta blocker. On examination, her heart rate is 180 bpm, regular, and she appears anxious. An ECG shows a narrow complex tachycardia consistent with paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia (PSVT). What is the most appropriate next step in the management of this patient's PSVT?",

Adenosine and verapamil are both used to terminate PSVT. However, there are some key differences between the two drugs: Feature Adenosine (Option B) Verapamil (Option A) Efficacy Equivalent to or better than verapamil for terminating PSVT Effective for terminating PSVT Duration of Action Short-acting (< 1 minute) Longer-acting than adenosine Adverse Effects Transient and generally mild (e.g., dyspnea, chest pain, flushing, hypotension, cardiac arrest) C/I in patients with hypotension, CHF, or those receiving beta-blockers Safety Safe in patients with wide QRS tachycardia C/I in patients with wide QRS tachycardia Other Considerations Requires rapid i.v injection, not suitable for prophylaxis of recurrent PSVT Can be used for prophylaxis of recurrent PSVT Use in Asthma Can precipitate bronchospasm, making verapamil the preferred choice for these patients DOC for PSVT in asthmatic patients Amiodarone (Option C) , a Class 3 antiarrhythmic drug with multiple mechanisms including beta-blocking properties, is often used for rate control in atrial fibrillation. The main use of vernakalant (Option D) , a class 3 antiarrhythmic drug, is for the rapid conversion of recent-onset atrial fibrillation (AF) to sinus rhythm in adults.

      "question": "Which of the following is the drug of choice for treating ventricular tachyarrhythmias induced by digoxin toxicity?",
      "options": {
        "A": "Amiodarone",
        "B": "Lidocaine",
        "C": "Procainamide",
        "D": "Verapamil"
      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "§ Excessive intracellular calcium § I automaticity and triggered activity in ventricular myocardium. Lidocaine § Blocks sodium channels in cardiac cells § Stabilizes the membrane potential and I automaticity, particularly during depolarisation. Decreased Ectopic Activity: Digoxin toxicity can cause ectopic pacemaker activity. Lidocaine suppresses ectopic pacemaker activity by decreasing cardiac cell excitability, and preventing abnormal electrical impulses. Reduced Reentry: By inhibiting reentrant pathways in the myocardium, lidocaine helps terminate sustained ventricular arrhythmias. Fast Onset of Action: Administered intravenously, lidocaine rapidly acts to manage acute ventricular arrhythmias induced by digoxin toxicity. Amiodarone (Option A) is not the preferred choice for ventricular tachyarrhythmias induced by digoxin toxicity due to potential drug interactions and exacerbation of digoxin toxicity. Procainamide (Option C) is an antiarrhythmic that can treat ventricular arrhythmias, but it is not preferred in digoxin toxicity due to its potential to exacerbate the condition and cause further complications. Verapamil (Option D) is a calcium channel blocker for supraventricular arrhythmias and hypertension. It is contraindicated in digoxin toxicity as it can increase digoxin levels and worsen ventricular arrhythmias.
