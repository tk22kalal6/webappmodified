      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: C) Caspofungin Explanation: Caspofungin, an echinocandin antifungal, inhibits 1,3-beta-glucan synthase, disrupting fungal cell wall synthesis and causing cell lysis and death. Cell wall inhibiting antifungals: Act by inhibiting the enzyme 1,3-beta-glucan synthase, essential for fungal cell wall formation. Caspofungin Micafungin Anidulafungin Cell membrane inhibiting antifungals: Drugs Mechanism of action Natamycin (Option A) Binds to ergosterol in the fungal cell membrane, disrupting membrane integrity. Terbinafine (Option D) It inhibits squalene epoxidase, reduces ergosterol synthesis, and affects cell membrane integrity. Amphotericin B Binds to ergosterol, forming pores in the fungal cell membrane, leading to cell death. Fluconazole, Itraconazole, Ketoconazole (Option B) Inhibits ergosterol synthesis, affecting cell membrane function.

Aspect Amphotericin B Mechanism of Action Binds to ergosterol in fungal cell membranes (Option A) , forming pores that disrupt membrane integrity, leading to leakage of cellular contents and fungal cell death. Preparation Conventional Amphotericin B (c-AMB) Amphotericin B lipid complex (ABLC) Liposomal Amphotericin B (L-AMB) Use Cryptococcal meningitis (Option D) , mucormycosis, coccidioidal meningitis. Adverse Effects Nephrotoxicity: Most notable with conventional Amphotericin B (c-AMB); less with liposomal formulations (Option B) . Fever, chills, and hypotension can be managed with pre-treatment (NSAIDs, antihistamines). Anemia (requires erythropoietin treatment).

      "correct_answer": "D",
      "explanation": "Correct answer: D) Fluconazole Explanation: Fluconazole is the only azole among the options that is primarily excreted via the kidneys (urine) . The rest of the azoles - Ketoconazole, Itraconazole, and Posaconazole - undergo hepatic metabolism and are primarily excreted via bile . Therefore, Fluconazole stands out for its renal clearance and dose adjustments are required in renal impairment . Excretion patterns of azoles: Azole Route of Excretion Dose Adjustment in Renal Failure Fluconazole Renal (urine) Yes Ketoconazole Hepatic (bile) No Itraconazole Hepatic (bile) No Posaconazole Hepatic (bile, feces) No Ketoconazole (Option A): Incorrect because it is extensively metabolized in the liver and eliminated via the biliary route . Itraconazole (Option B): Incorrect because it is lipophilic , has hepatic metabolism , and is excreted mainly in bile . Posaconazole (Option C): Incorrect as it is also primarily excreted via feces , indicating biliary excretion . Reference: K D Tripathi, Essentials of Medical Pharmacology, 8th edition, Page 844",

        "D": "Enhanced elimination of cyclosporine"
      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: B) Elevated risk of toxicity with cyclosporine . Explanation: Ketoconazole is a strong CYP3A4 inhibitor . Cyclosporine is metabolized by CYP3A4. When ketoconazole is co-administered, it inhibits cyclosporine metabolism , leading to elevated blood levels . This significantly increases the risk of cyclosporine-induced toxicity , especially nephrotoxicity and neurotoxicity . Drug Interactions: Drug Mechanism Impact on Cyclosporine Cyclosporine Immunosuppressant; CYP3A4 substrate Narrow therapeutic index; toxic if elevated Ketoconazole CYP3A4 inhibitor Reduces metabolism → ↑ cyclosporine levels Adverse Effects of Ketoconazole: System Adverse Effects Hepatic Hepatotoxicity (boxed warning); can be severe or fatal Endocrine Inhibits steroidogenesis → ↓ cortisol/testosterone → gynecomastia, impotence GI Nausea, vomiting, abdominal discomfort Skin Pruritus, rash QT Prolongation Risk of torsades de pointes when combined with other QT-prolonging drugs Decreased effectiveness of cyclosporine (Option A): Incorrect. Ketoconazole increases , not decreases, cyclosporine levels by inhibiting its metabolism. No significant interaction between ketoconazole and cyclosporine (Option C): Incorrect. The interaction is clinically significant ; it mandates dose adjustment and close monitoring . Enhanced elimination of cyclosporine (Option D): Incorrect. Ketoconazole slows elimination by inhibiting CYP3A4, leading to drug accumulation. Reference: K D Tripathi, Essentials of Medical Pharmacology, 8th edition, Page 844",

Uses Topical: Used for treating tinea infections (ringworm) and pityriasis versicolor (fungal skin infection). Oral: DOC for onychomycosis (fungal infection of the nails), tinea capitis (scalp ringworm), and extensive fungal lesions. It is also used in oromucosal candidiasis as an alternative to fluconazole. Side effects Taste disturbance and rash; topical application causes dryness, itching and irritation. Inhibition of thymidylate synthase (Option A) Flucytosine (5-FC) converts into 5-fluorodeoxyuridylic acid within the fungal cell and acts as an inhibitor of thymidylate synthase. It is a narrow-spectrum fungistatic agent active towards Cryptococcus neoformans and chromoblastomyces. Inhibition of lanosterol 14-methylase (Option B) Azoles inhibit fungal cytochrome P450 enzyme - lanosterol 15-methylase, which results in abnormal membrane formation.\\ It is a broad-spectrum antifungal agent that is active against dermatophytes, candida and other deep fungal infections (except mucormycosis) Formation of pore in ergosterol membrane (Option D) Amphotericin B has lipophilic and",
