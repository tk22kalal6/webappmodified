      },
      "correct_answer": "D",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: D) Inhibition of IL2, IL4, IL5 The teratogenic effects of thalidomide are primarily linked to oxidative stress, suppression of angiogenesis, and cereblon binding. Immunomodulatory effects, such as inhibition of IL2, IL4, and IL5, are unrelated to its teratogenicity. Thalidomide is known for its ability to inhibit angiogenesis, which is the formation of new blood vessels. It acts by inhibiting the production of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF), both of which play crucial roles in angiogenesis. It is a hypnotic drug that was taken early in pregnancy for morning sickness, which lead to an epidemic phocomelia (seal limb), in which limbs are malformed. The properties of thalidomide, like the release of reactive oxygen species and free radicals (Option A), Suppression of angiogenesis (Option B) and Cereblon binding (Option C) can lead to teratogenicity.

      "question": "Which of the following is not an immune checkpoint inhibitor?",
      "options": {
        "A": "Nivolumab",
        "B": "Pembrolizumab",
        "C": "Atezolimumab",
        "D": "Cetuximab"
      },
      "correct_answer": "D",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: D) Cetuximab Explanation: Cetuximab is not an immune checkpoint inhibitor. It is a monoclonal antibody that targets the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) in cancer cells, thus preventing cell proliferation. It treats certain types of colorectal and head and neck cancers that overexpress EGFR rather than HER2. Nivolumab, Pembrolizumab & Atezolimumab are all immune checkpoint inhibitors. (Other options ruled out) Immune checkpoint inhibitors: They are a class of cancer immunotherapy drugs that target the PD-1 receptor on T-cells. MOA: Immune Checkpoint Inhibitors and their uses:",

      "question": "What is the mechanism of action of cyclosporine?",
      "options": {
        "A": "Inhibition of calcinuerin",
        "B": "Amp kinase stimulation",
        "C": "IMP dehydrogenase inhibitions",
        "D": "Dihydro-orotate dehydrogenase inhibitor"
      },
      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer A - Inhibition of calcineurin Cyclosporine is an immunosuppressive medication that inhibits the activity of calcineurin, which is a phosphatase enzyme that is involved in T-cell activation. Cyclosporine MOA Binds to cyclophilin, a protein that is expressed in T-cells, and this complex then binds to and inhibits calcineurin It results in a reduced transcription of cytokine genes for IL-2, TNF-alpha, IL-3, IL-4, CD40L and Granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factors and interferon-gamma Ultimately, this results in a reduction in T-cell proliferation - Immunosuppression and immunomodulation Uses Post-solid organ transplantation - to avoid organ rejection Rheumatoid arthritis, which has not responded to methotrexate Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis Steroid resistant Foca segental glomerulosclerosis Psoriasis Adverse effect Reduced GFR Hypomagnesemia Hyperkalemia Dyslipidemia Gynecomastia Hypertrichosis Neurotoxicity - convulsion AMP kinase (AMPK) (Option B) is an enzyme that plays a key role in regulating cellular energy metabolism. It is activated when cellular energy levels are low, and it promotes the production of ATP, the primary energy source for cells. It is not known to stimulate the activity of AMP kinase. In fact, some research suggests that cyclosporine may inhibit the activity of AMPK, although the mechanisms underlying this effect are not well understood. Inosine monophosphate dehydrogenase (IMPDH) (Option C) is an enzyme that is involved in the synthesis of guanosine nucleotides, which are building blocks of DNA and RNA. Cyclosporine is not known to inhibit the activity of IMPDH. However, another immunosuppressive medication called mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) does inhibit IMPDH, and it is often used in combination with cyclosporine to treat transplant rejection. Dihydro-orotate dehydrogenase inhibition (Option D) is an enzyme that is involved in the synthesis of pyrimidine nucleotides, which are also building blocks of DNA and RNA. Cyclosporine is not known to inhibit the activity of DHODH. Reference: Goodman and Gilman's The Pharmacological Basis of Therapeutics, 14th Edition, Page 640-644, 875",
