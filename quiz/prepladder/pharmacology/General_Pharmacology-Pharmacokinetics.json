      },
      "correct_answer": "D",
      "explanation": "Correct answer: D) Kinetics changes from first order to zero order at higher doses. Explanation: Phenytoin follows a different elimination pattern, where it initially follows first-order kinetics but the metabolising enzymes get saturated above therapeutic concentration and the pattern changes from first to zero order kinetics. Such pattern shows a curved plot and is called non-linear elimination. Common drugs that follow a non-linear elimination: Phenytoin. Tolbutamide. Theophylline. Warfarin. The rate of elimination is proportional to plasma concentration (Options A) & half-life remains constant irrespective of plasma concentration (Option B) : They are properties of drugs that purely follow first-order kinetics.

      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Correct answer: C) Pgp is involved in drug efflux from tumour cells Explanation: P-glycoprotein (P-gp), also known as ATP-binding cassette sub-family B member 1 ( ABCB1 ) or multidrug resistance protein 1 ( MDR1 ), is an efflux transporter protein. Its primary function is to pump out a wide range of substances, including drugs, from inside the cell to outside the cell (drug efflux). (Options: A, B, and D ruled out). When Pgp is overexpressed or hyperactive in cancer cells, it leads to increased efflux of chemotherapeutic drugs out of the cells (leads to drug resistance). Location of Pgp in various body tissues: GIT: Decreases absorption of the drug. Kidney: Increases urinary excretion of the drug. Liver: Increases bile excretion of the drug. Blood-brain-barrier/Placenta: Decreases drug entry into the brain/placental cells. Substrate of p-glycoprotein transporter: E.g. Digoxin.

      },
      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Correct answer: C) Increased risk of drug toxicity Explanation: Drugs with high plasma protein binding rely heavily on albumin for transportation in the bloodstream. Hypoalbuminemia (low levels of albumin in the blood) reduces the available binding sites for these drugs, leading to higher concentrations of free, unbound drugs in the bloodstream. This can result in increased drug potency and a higher risk of adverse effects or toxicity (Options A, B and D ruled out). Examples include phenytoin and furosemide. The clinically significant implications of plasma protein binding are: Highly plasma protein-bound drugs are restricted to the vascular compartment as they do not cross membranes → smaller volumes of distribution. The drug's bound fraction is not available for action but is in equilibrium with the free drug in plasma, which is available for metabolism and elimination, causing the bound fraction to dissociate as free drug concentration decreases. High protein binding generally prolongs the drug's action as the bound fraction is not readily metabolised or excreted. Glomerular filtration does not significantly reduce the concentration of free drugs in the efferent vessels. Highly protein-bound drugs are not removed by haemodialysis. A single drug can bind to multiple sites on the albumin molecule. Multiple drugs can bind to the same site on albumin, leading to potential displacement interactions.

      },
      "correct_answer": "D",
      "explanation": "Correct answer: D) The half-life (T1/2) is unaffected by liver metabolism. Explanation: The Plasma half-life (t½) of a drug is the time taken for its plasma concentration to be reduced to half of its original value. It is influenced by various factors, including metabolism. Drugs metabolised by the liver can have their half-life altered by changes in liver function or enzyme activity. Liver metabolism can either increase or decrease the half-life of a drug, depending on whether the metabolites are active or inactive and how rapidly they are eliminated from the body. The volume of distribution (Vd) is a measure of drug distribution in the body (Option A): Once a drug has gained access to the bloodstream, it gets distributed to other tissues that initially had no drug, concentration gradient being in the direction of plasma to tissues. The extent of distribution of a drug and its pattern of tissue distribution depends on its: Lipid solubility. Ionisation at physiological pH (a function of its pKa). The extent of binding to plasma and tissue proteins. The presence of tissue-specific transporters. Differences in regional blood flow. Clearance (Cl) represents the rate at which a drug is eliminated from the body (Option B): The clearance of a drug is the theoretical volume of plasma from which the drug is completely removed in a unit of time. It can be calculated as: CL = Rate of elimination/C Where C is the plasma concentration. Bioavailability (F) is the fraction of an administered dose that reaches systemic circulation unchanged (Option C): Bioavailability refers to the rate and extent of a drug's absorption from a dosage form administered by any route, as determined by its concentration-time curve in blood or excretion in urine. It measures the fraction (F) of the administered drug dose that reaches the systemic circulation in the unchanged form.

      "explanation": "Correct Answer: C) Ammonium chloride Explanation: The patient presents with acute amphetamine toxicity , which typically causes CNS stimulation (agitation, confusion), autonomic hyperactivity (hyperthermia, mydriasis), and can lead to seizures or cardiovascular complications. The most appropriate management for acute amphetamine toxicity is urinary acidification with ammonium chloride to enhance the elimination of the drug. Amphetamine Toxicity: CNS Effects Restlessness, dizziness, tremor, hyperactive reflexes Talkativeness, tenseness, irritability, insomnia Euphoria, confusion, aggressiveness Anxiety, changes in libido, delirium, hallucinations (paranoid), panic states Suicidal or homicidal tendencies (especially in mentally ill) Fatigue and depression follow stimulation Cardiovascular Effects Headache, chilliness, pallor/flushing Palpitations, arrhythmias, anginal pain Hypertension or hypotension Circulatory collapse Gastrointestinal Effects Dry mouth, metallic taste, anorexia Nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal cramps Other Symptoms Fever, excessive sweating Fatal cases: convulsions, coma, cerebral hemorrhages Dose-related Toxicity Idiosyncratic reaction can occur with as little as 2 mg Severe reactions reported at 30 mg 400–500 mg not uniformly fatal; chronic users tolerate higher doses Treatment Urinary acidification with ammonium chloride to enhance excretion Sedatives for CNS symptoms Sodium nitroprusside or alpha-adrenergic blocker for severe hypertension Benzodiazepines (Option A) are used mainly to control CNS symptoms like agitation and seizures but do not enhance drug elimination. Beta-blockers (Option B): Incorrect because non-selective beta-blockers can worsen hypertension via unopposed alpha-adrenergic stimulation . Sodium bicarbonate (Option D): Incorrect unless there is a wide QRS complex arrhythmia due to sodium channel blockade, which is not indicated in this scenario.

      "options": {
        "A": "Highly polar drugs are readily absorbed through the lipid membranes",
        "B": "Non-polar drugs are readily absorbed",
        "C": "Maximum unionisation of an acidic drug occurs in the small intestine",
        "D": "Non-ionized forms of drugs are less likely to be absorbed than ionised forms."
      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Correct answer: B) Non-polar drugs are readily absorbed Explanation: Cell membranes are primarily composed of lipids. Lipophilic or non-polar drugs can dissolve in lipids and cross these lipid-rich barriers. Due to their affinity for lipid components, lipophilic substances can passively diffuse through cell membranes. This passive diffusion is a common mechanism by which drugs are absorbed. Highly polar drugs are readily absorbed through the lipid membranes (Option A) : Highly polar drugs are less likely to pass through the lipid membranes due to their low solubility. Polar or hydrophilic drugs are water-soluble, lack lipid solubility , and require specialised transporters or channels for absorption across cell membranes. Maximum unionisation of an acidic drug occurs in the small intestine (Option C): A drug's degree of ionisation is influenced by its pKa (the pH at which it is 50% ionised) and the pH of its environment. Acidic drugs tend to be ionised in basic environments (higher pH) and non-ionised in acidic environments (lower pH) and vice versa. Accordingly, the maximum unionisation of acidic drugs occurs in the stomach , not the small intestine. Non-ionized forms of drugs are less likely to be absorbed than ionised forms (Option D): Non-ionized drugs are more lipid-soluble and more readily absorbed through lipid membranes.

      "question": "A 55-year-old male with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is being treated with theophylline. He is prescribed erythromycin for a respiratory tract infection. Which of the following outcomes is most likely due to the interaction between these two drugs?",
      "options": {
        "A": "Decreased plasma concentration of theophylline",
        "B": "Increased risk of theophylline toxicity",
        "C": "No significant interaction",
        "D": "Decreased efficacy of erythromycin"
      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Correct answer: B) Increased risk of theophylline toxicity Explanation: Erythromycin is an inhibitor of the cytochrome P450 enzyme CYP1A2 , which metabolises theophylline. Inhibition of this enzyme leads to higher plasma levels of theophylline , increasing the risk of toxicity. Theophylline toxicity: It has a narrow margin of safety , and dose-dependent toxicity starts from the upper half of the therapeutic concentration range.

      "question": "A patient with epilepsy is prescribed both Phenytoin and lamotrigine for seizure control. The patient reports worsening seizures despite adhering to the prescribed regimen. Which of the following best explains the potential reason for the failure of the regimen?",
      "options": {
        "A": "Increased absorption of lamotrigine",
        "B": "Toxicity of lamotrigine",

        "D": "Inhibition of transport of lamotrigine"
      },
      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: C) Increased metabolism of lamotrigine Explanation: Lamotrigine is primarily metabolized by glucuronidation via the enzyme UGT1A4 . Phenytoin is a potent enzyme inducer , especially of UGT and CYP450 enzymes. When given together, phenytoin induces the metabolism of lamotrigine , leading to: Faster clearance of lamotrigine Lower plasma levels Subtherapeutic effect , resulting in worsening seizures despite compliance Enzyme Inducers and Inhibitors Enzyme Inducers : These increase drug metabolism → ↓ Drug effect Mnemonic – GRAASS: Inducer Effect Griseofulvin Antifungal – induces CYP enzymes Rifampicin Strong CYP3A4 inducer Antiepileptics Phenytoin, Carbamazepine, Phenobarbital – all induce metabolism Alcohol (Chronic) Induces CYP2E1 Smoking Induces CYP1A2 St. John’s Wort Induces CYP3A4 and P-gp Enzyme Inhibitors : These decrease metabolism → ↑ Drug levels (toxicity risk) Mnemonic – G-PACMAN: Inhibitor Notes Grapefruit juice Inhibits intestinal CYP3A4 Protease inhibitors e.g., ritonavir – inhibits CYP3A4 Azoles e.g., ketoconazole – potent CYP inhibitors Cimetidine H2 blocker – inhibits multiple CYPs Macrolides e.g., erythromycin – inhibits CYP3A4 Amiodarone Inhibits CYP2C9, CYP3A4 Non-DHP CCBs Verapamil, Diltiazem – inhibit CYP3A4 Increased absorption of lamotrigine (Option A): Phenytoin does not affect lamotrigine's absorption significantly. The issue lies in its metabolism , not uptake. Toxicity of lamotrigine (Option B): Toxicity occurs when metabolism is inhibited (e.g., by valproate), not when induced. Here, levels drop. Inhibition of transport of lamotrigine (Option D): There’s no major known effect of phenytoin on lamotrigine transporters.
