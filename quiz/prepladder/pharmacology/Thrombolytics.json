      "question": "A 70-year-old woman came with complaints of sudden onset of pain, swelling, and redness in her left calf. She has been experiencing difficulty walking and standing for the past two days. She has a history of hypertension and high cholesterol, which is being managed with diet and medication. On giving which of the following drugs will we need to monitor her clotting time for?",

        "A": "Aspirin",
        "B": "Heparin",
        "C": "Alteplase",
        "D": "Apixaban"
      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Correct answer: B) Heparin Explanation: When a patient is started on Heparin, an anticoagulant, it is crucial to monitor their clotting time to ensure the dosage is effective and safe. This is usually done by measuring the prothrombin time (PT) and activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT). Based on her symptoms and physical exam findings, she likely has deep vein thrombosis (DVT) in her left leg. Hence, an anticoagulant like Heparin should be started immediately to prevent the clot from growing or breaking off and travelling to the lungs (pulmonary embolism). Lepirudin (used in Heparin-Induced Thrombocytopenia) also requires aPTT monitoring Aspirin (Option A): is an antiplatelet drug that does not require regular monitoring of clotting time. When given, it requires monitoring of bleeding time. Alteplase (Options C): is a thrombolytic agents used to dissolve clots but monitoring of clotting time is not typically part of their standard administration protocol. Instead, they require careful monitoring of the patient’s overall condition and signs of bleeding. Further, when given, its action can be monitored using D- Dimer to detect the degradation product of fibrin. Apixaban (Option D) is an oral direct factor Xa inhibitor that prevents thrombin generation and clot formation, with no routine monitoring of clotting time required, though renal function and bleeding risk should be periodically assessed.",

      "question": "A 58-year-old female patient with a history of atrial fibrillation visits for routine follow-up. She has been prescribed an antiplatelet drug to reduce her risk of stroke. Her medication regimen includes clopidogrel, which she has been taking for the past six months without any adverse effects. Which receptor is primarily targeted by clopidogrel to inhibit platelet aggregation?",

      },
      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "Correct answer: A) P2Y12 receptor Explanation: Clopidogrel is an antiplatelet drug that it is used for primary prophylaxis of MI and stroke, specifically targets the P2Y12 receptor on the surface of platelets. By inhibiting this receptor, clopidogrel prevents ADP from binding, thereby reducing platelet activation and aggregation, which helps to lower the risk of thrombotic events such as stroke in patients with atrial fibrillation.

        "D": "500 mg orally"
      },
      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Correct answer: C) 325 mg orally Explanation: In acute myocardial infarction, the recommended initial dose of aspirin is 160-325 mg, administered orally as soon as possible. This dose helps to quickly and significantly inhibit platelet thromboxane synthesis which leads to reduced platelet attachment. Dosage of Aspirin: Acute MI and Stroke - 325 mg orally (Loading dose for MI) Secondary prevention - 75-150 mg orally (Low dose aspirin) 75 mg (Option A) is more suitable for long-term secondary prevention 150 mg (Option B) is not commonly used as an initial dose in this context. 500 mg (Option D) is not recommended as it exceeds the effective dose range without additional benefit.

      "question": "A 72-year-old female patient with a history of atrial fibrillation and coronary artery disease is scheduled for elective hip replacement surgery in two weeks. She has been taking low-dose aspirin (75 mg daily) for secondary prevention of MI and stroke. Which of the following is the most appropriate management regarding her aspirin therapy before surgery?",

        "A": "Continue aspirin at the same dose through the surgery.",
        "B": "Stop aspirin immediately and resume after the surgery.",
        "C": "Stop aspirin 7-10 days before surgery and resume after the surgery.",
        "D": "Switch from aspirin to clopidogrel until after the surgery."
      },
      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Correct answer: C) Stop aspirin 7-10 days before surgery and resume after the surgery. Explanation: The patient is scheduled for elective surgery, which carries a risk of bleeding. Stopping aspirin 7-10 days before surgery (Option C) is recommended to allow time for new platelets to form (since platelets have a life span of 7-10 days), thus reducing bleeding risk while maintaining cardiovascular protection. Mechanism of Action of Aspirin: Clinical Uses and Dosage: Aspirin is the drug of choice for MI (Myocardial infarction) Stroke Buerger's disease Aspirin is used in low doses (typically 75 mg daily) for long-term prophylaxis against MI and stroke in patients with cardiovascular disease or atrial fibrillation. Higher doses of aspirin (160-325 mg) are used in the initial management of acute myocardial infarction (MI). Precautions: Pre-surgical Considerations: To minimise the risk of perioperative bleeding, it is generally recommended to stop aspirin 7-10 days before elective surgery to allow regeneration of platelets with normal function. In its place, Low Molecular Weight Heparin (Ex, Enoxaparin) 5000U s.c. twice dailyis used. Switching to clopidogrel (Option D) is not appropriate as it also affects platelet function and can increase bleeding risk.",

        "D": "Ticlopidine"
      },
      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Correct answer: C) Ticagrelor Explanation: Ticagrelor is a reversible antiplatelet agent that falls under ADP receptor blocker. ADP receptor blockers are a class of antiplatelet agents that inhibit the P2Y12 receptor on platelets, thus preventing platelet aggregation. These drugs are commonly used in the management of acute coronary syndrome and other cardiovascular conditions to reduce the risk of thrombotic events. The ADP receptor blockers can be categorized into reversible and irreversible agents, which differ in their duration of action and the binding nature to the P2Y12 receptor. Irreversible blockers - permanently bind to the P2Y12 receptor on the platelet surface. Once a platelet is affected, it remains inhibited for its lifespan. Reversible blockers - bind to the P2Y12 receptor in a reversible manner, allowing for a quicker offset of action if needed. Vorapaxar (Option A) (PAR 1 blocker) also has reversible action. Irreversible blockers (prodrugs) Reversible blockers (active drugs) Ticlodipine. (Option D) Clopidogrel Prasugrel. (Option B) Ticagrelor. Cangrelor: IV drug (used during percutaneous transluminal coronary angiography- PTCA). Clinical Uses of ADP receptor blockers: ACS, PCI, stroke prevention.

      },
      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Correct answer: C) History of ischemic stroke Explanation: From the given history, the patient likely has developed acute MI. ADP receptor blockers , such as clopidogrel, prasugrel, and ticagrelor, are antiplatelet agents used to reduce the risk of thrombotic events in patients with acute coronary syndromes, including MI. Inhibit platelet aggregation by blocking the ADP receptors on platelet cell membranes, thereby preventing clot formation. While ticlopidine and clopidogrel can be given in both MI and stroke, prasugrel, ticagrelor, and cangrelor are used only in MI and are contraindicated in patients with a history stroke due to the increased risk of severe bleeding (risk of hemorrhagic stroke). Hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and diabetes mellitus (Option A,B, and D) are not contraindications for ADP receptor blockers. Many patients with acute coronary syndrome also have hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and diabetes and ADP receptor blockers can be safely used in these patients.

      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Correct answer: B) Dipyridamole Explanation: Dipyridamole, a PDE-3 Inhibitor , is known to cause coronary steal syndrome, which can exacerbate angina by dilating the relatively constricted arterioles of the healthy myocardium, leading to redistribution of blood flow away from the ischemic myocardium. Dipyridamole and other PDE-3 inhibitors(Pentoxifylline, Cilostazol) act by blocking PDE-3 Receptors on platelets thereby increasing cAMP and inhibiting platelet recruitment. However, Dipyridamole is approved for secondary prevention of stroke when it is combined with aspirin.

      "explanation": "and oxygen demand. Correct answer: C) They may inhibit PDE3 in the heart, leading to increased cardiac stimulation and oxygen demand. Explanation: PDE-3 inhibitors increase cAMP levels, which can lead to increased cardiac stimulation . In patients with a history of myocardial infarction, this increased cardiac stimulation can elevate heart rate and oxygen demand , potentially worsening the patient's condition and increasing the risk of adverse cardiac events. While PDE-3 inhibitors do have some effects on blood platelets and may be used to prevent clot formation, the primary concern in myocardial infarction patients is not an increased risk of bleeding but rather the increased cardiac workload and oxygen demand. ( Option A) PDE-3 inhibitors can cause hypotension as a side effect due to their vasodilatory effects, but this is not the primary reason they are contraindicated in patients with a history of myocardial infarction. ( Option B ) PDE-3 inhibitors are more likely to cause tachycardia (increased heart rate) rather than bradycardia (decreased heart rate). Heart block is also not a typical concern with PDE-3 inhibitors. ( Option D) Reference: Pubmed Goodman & Gilman Pharmacological Basis of Therapeutics, 14th Edition, Page 502",
