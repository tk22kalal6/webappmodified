      },
      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: C) Zoledronic acid Explanation: Zoledronic acid is a bisphosphonate that is considered the drug of choice for the treatment of hypercalcemia of malignancy due to its potent ability to inhibit bone resorption and lower serum calcium levels effectively. Management of hypercalcemia in malignancy: Initial Treatment Intravenous hydration with normal saline to increase renal calcium excretion and glomerular filtration rate. Loop diuretics (e.g. furosemide) after initial volume expansion to enhance calciuresis. Pharmacologic Therapy Calcitonin: Provides a rapid but short-lived reduction in serum calcium levels. Bisphosphonates (e.g. Zoledronic acid, Pamidronate) : Potent inhibitors of osteoclast-mediated bone resorption, providing a more sustained reduction in calcium levels. Denosumab: A monoclonal antibody that inhibits osteoclast activity, effective in bisphosphonate-refractory hypercalcemia. Glucocorticoids: Used in calcitriol-mediated hypercalcemia to inhibit vitamin D conversion. Refractory Hypercalcemia Denosumab can be used as an alternative for refractory or recurrent hypercalcemia despite treatment with bisphosphonates. Hemodialysis may be considered in patients with advanced kidney disease. Reference: K D Tripathi, Essentials of Medical Pharmacology, 8th Edition, Page 338",

        "D": "There is no specific method of administration of Goserelin"
      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: B) Continuous daily injection of Goserelin Explanation: This patient has precocious puberty due to excessive gonadotropin production and is treated with daily continuous injections of Goserelin. Goserelin acts on the GnRH receptors in the pituitary gland, and its continuous elevation leads to a negative feedback mechanism, causing receptor downregulation. As a result, endogenous levels of LH and FSH decrease, which in turn lowers estrogen and progesterone levels. GnRH elicits different responses based on the administration of the drug: Intermittent injection Continuous injection Mechanism of action This is used when increased gonadotropin secretion is needed. As an agonist, its initial action stimulates the GnRH receptors, resulting in the release of gonadotropins. This is preferred when decreased levels of gonadotropins or sex hormones are needed. Continuous stimulation results in a negative feedback mechanism on the receptors, leading to their downregulation. Uses DOC in Delayed puberty. Azoospermia (Male Infertility). Anovulation (Female Infertility). DOC in Prostate carcinoma. DOC in Precocious puberty. Endometriosis. Adverse effects Increased size of the ovary may lead to pain in the abdomen. Rupture of the ovary: Hemoperitoneum. Postmenopausal symptoms include hot flashes, Osteoporosis and Depression.

      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "bleeding. Correct Answer: B) Octreotide is preferred over Terlipressin for managing oesophagal variceal bleeding. Explanation: Although octreotide can be used to manage oesophagal variceal bleeding, it is not preferred over terlipressin , which is more effective. Octreotide: It is a somatostatin analogue, which is 40 times more potent than Somatostatin in the suppression of GH secretion. (Option A) Octreotide, a somatostatin analogue, has a significantly prolonged half-life of around 90 minutes compared to somatostatin's short half-life of 3-4 minutes, owing to enhanced stability and resistance to enzymatic degradation, enabling less frequent dosing and sustained therapeutic effects. Mechanism of action Uses Reduces Growth hormone secretion due to inhibitory action on the pituitary. Acromegaly Reduces glucagon and insulin secretion. Glucagonoma / insulinoma Reduces Gastrointestinal motility and secretion of secretory hormones such as CCK, VIP and serotonin. Secretory diarrhoea in VIPoma, Carcinoid syndrome (DOC: Octreotide) (Option C) , Short bowel syndrome, Cancer-induced diarrhoea. Reduces portal pressure by decreasing splanchnic blood flow. (But terlipressin is preferred over octreotide as it is more effective). (Option B) Oesophageal variceal bleed. Adverse effects of Octreotide: As it reduces secretory hormones such as CCK, it causes biliary stasis, thus increasing the risk of gallbladder stones. (Option D) Steatorrhoea. Rarely hyperglycemia.

        "D": "Lasofoxifene"
      },
      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: A) Raloxifene EXPLANATION: Raloxifene is a Selective Estrogen Receptor Modulator (SERM) that exhibits tissue-specific estrogen receptor agonist or antagonist effects. By acting as an estrogen agonist in bone, raloxifene increases bone mineral density (BMD) and improves bone strength, thereby reducing the risk of osteoporotic fractures, particularly vertebral fractures. Raloxifene is FDA-approved for both the prevention and treatment of postmenopausal osteoporosis, making it a suitable option for women at risk of developing osteoporosis or those who have already been diagnosed with the condition. Raloxifene is administered orally as a once-daily tablet. Adverse effects include hot flashes, leg cramps, venous thromboembolic events (VTE), and an increased risk of fatal stroke in postmenopausal women with coronary heart disease. Bazedoxifene(Option B) It is FDA-approved for the prevention of postmenopausal osteoporosis but not for treatment. While it increases BMD, its efficacy in reducing fracture risk is not as well-established as raloxifene. Tamoxifen(Option C) It is primarily used for the treatment and prevention of breast cancer recurrence. While it may have some beneficial effects on bone health, it is not FDA-approved for the treatment of osteoporosis. Lasofoxifene(Option D) It is not currently FDA-approved for the treatment of osteoporosis, although it has shown promise in increasing BMD and reducing fracture risk in clinical trials.

      "explanation": "Correct Answer: B) Teriparatide EXPLANATION: Paget's disease of bone (or) Osteitis deformans is a chronic bone disorder characterised by the excessive breakdown and formation of bone tissue. This can lead to weakened bones that are misshapen and prone to fractures. Teriparatide is contraindicated in Paget's disease because it can exacerbate the condition by worsening the abnormal bone remodelling through its stimulation of bone formation. Paget's disease and hypercalcaemia are the contraindications of Teriparatide.

      "explanation": "Correct Answer: D) Cinacalcet EXPLANATION: Cinacalcet is not a form of Vitamin D but a calcimimetic agent used to manage Secondary hyperparathyroidism. Vitamin D Calcimimetic drugs Examples Cholecalciferol Ergocalciferol Calciferol Doxercalciferol Alfacalcidol Maxacalcitol Paricalcitol Cinacalcet Etelcalcetide Evocalcet MOA Increases intestinal absorption of calcium and phosphate. Promotes bone mineralisation by increasing calcium and phosphate levels in blood. Modulates the calcium-sensing receptor (CaSR) activity on the parathyroid gland, leading to decreased secretion of PTH. Uses Nutritional rickets Vitamin D-deficiency rickets Familial hypophosphatemia Osteomalacia Osteoporosis Hypoparathyroidism Secondary hyperparathyroidism in CKD patients. Hypercalcemia in parathyroid carcinoma. Adverse effects Vitamin D is generally safe when taken in appropriate doses, but excessive intake can lead to various adverse effects due to increased calcium levels in the blood: Hypercalciuria, Increased risk of stones, Nausea, vomiting, constipation. Arrhythmias. Hypocalcemia (principal adverse event) Potential development of adynamic bone disease if PTH level falls below 100 pg/mL. Potential increase in risk for upper gastrointestinal bleeding.

      "explanation": "Correct Answer: A) Hypercalcemia EXPLANATION: Hypercalcemia is not a side effect of bisphosphonates. Bisphosphonates are used to treat conditions like osteoporosis and are designed to reduce bone resorption, thereby lowering calcium levels in the blood. Adverse effects of Bisphosphonates: Short term Long term 1. Upper GI: nausea, dyspepsia, abdominal pain, and gastritis 1. Osteonecrosis of jaw - Poor oral hygiene, invasive dental procedures or denture use, and prolonged exposure to high doses of IV bisphosphonates appear to increase the risk of ONJ development 2. Acute phase reactions associated with IV bisphosphonate therapy,it usually lasts 24 to 72 hours and is characterized by fever, myalgias, and arthralgias. 2. Atrial fibrillation 3. Severe musculoskeletal pain 3. Severe suppression of bone turnover 4. Hypocalcemia 4. Subtrochanteric femoral fractures. 5. Ocular inflammation-eg, uveitis, conjunctivitis, episcleritis, and scleritis (rare) Bisphosphonate Adverse Effects Etidronate Interference with bone mineralisation, potential osteomalacia. Pamidronate Thrombophlebitis, bone pain, fever, leukopenia, flu-like symptom. Alendronate Esophagitis, gastric erosion, retrosternal pain, flatulence. Ibandronate Risk of flu-like symptoms with intravenous infusion. Risedronate Generally well-tolerated, potential for gastrointestinal upset. Zoledronate Severe hypocalcemia, nephrotoxicity, flu-like symptoms, osteonecrosis of the jaw. Oral Bisphosphonates causes esophagitis : Should be administered on an empty stomach with plenty of distilled water. Patient should not eat anything and should not lie down for 30 minutes - To avoid reflux esophagitis Bisphosphonates are associated with increased risk of Subtrochanteric femur fracture. Bisphosphonates are C/I in renal failure. Regular dental check-ups are advised to monitor for osteonecrosis of the jaw.

      "explanation": "Correct Answer: B) Bisphosphonates EXPLANATION: The patient's history of a pathological wrist fracture, combined with her T-scores (particularly the hip T-score of -2.5, which is classified as osteoporosis), indicates that she is at high risk for further fractures. Bisphosphonates are considered the drug of choice for the treatment of osteoporosis. They are highly effective in increasing bone mineral density (BMD) and reducing the risk of vertebral and non-vertebral fractures. The most commonly used bisphosphonates include Alendronate, Risedronate, Ibandronate, and Zoledronic acid. Bisphosphonates given maximum up to 10 yrs, beyond that it increase the risk of femur fracture. Uses of Bisphosphonates: Condition Role of Bisphosphonates Osteoporosis Effective in preventing and treating postmenopausal osteoporosis, age-related, idiopathic, and steroid-induced osteoporosis.
