      "explanation": "fibrillation and rapid ventricular response. It helps control heart rate and improve symptoms in patients with atrial fibrillation. Digoxin at therapeutic concentrations mildly inhibits the cardiac Na+/K+ ATPase, causing an increase in intracellular Na + . Increased Na + inhibits Ca 2+ extrusion via the NCX, resulting in higher intracellular Ca 2+ and enhanced contractility. The increased contractility and cardiac output provide symptomatic relief (primarily in systolic dysfunction) in patients with heart failure. When the main trigger for neurohumoral activation is removed, sympathetic nerve tone, heart rate, and peripheral vascular resistance drop. The decrease in preload and afterload reduces chamber dilation and wall stress. Increased renal perfusion lowers renin production and increases diuresis, further decreasing preload. Uses of digoxin: The most effective drug capable of relieving CHF symptoms and restoring cardiac compensation, especially in patients with dilated heart and low ejection fraction. Rate control in atrial fibrillation and atrial flutter. Lisinopril(Option A) is an ACE inhibitor used in heart failure but does not directly address the patient's atrial fibrillation or rapid ventricular response. Carvedilol(Option B) is a beta-blocker used in heart failure but does not specifically target atrial fibrillation. Furosemide(Option C) is a loop diuretic that manages fluid overload in heart failure but does not address the patient's arrhythmia.

        "D": "Nesiritide is generally preferred over ARNIs (sacubitril-valsartan)."
      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Correct answer: B) It is contraindicated to combine with ACE inhibitors. Explanation: Neprilysin inhibition by sacubitril increases levels of substance P and bradykinin (also degraded by neprilysin), and ACE inhibitors further increase bradykinin by inhibiting its breakdown. This dual effect significantly raises the risk of angioedema, making the combination unsafe. Sacubitril is a drug that inhibits neprilysin, an enzyme that degrades peptides (Option A) like ANP, BNP, and C-type natriuretic peptides. The resultant reduction in their degradation increases natriuresis, thus improving heart failure. Neprilysin is also associated with the degradation of substance P and bradykinin , which are also increased while using ACE inhibitors. This increases the cumulative risk of angioedema; hence, this combination is contraindicated. Hence it is generally combined with an angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB), called ARNIs (Angiotensin receptor - neprilysin inhibitors). Nesiritide directly increases BNP levels, which can be less controlled and may cause hypotension, limiting its use. ARNIs provide a more sustained and balanced effect by increasing endogenous natriuretic peptides. Therefore ARNIs are preferred over nesiritide in most HFrEF cases. (Option D) Sacubitril is a prodrug metabolized to its active metabolite, LBQ657 , which inhibits neprilysin. The half-life of LBQ657 is approximately 11.5 hours (not 3 hours), allowing for twice-daily dosing of sacubitril/valsartan.

      "explanation": "of angiotensin 1 to angiotensin 2, are a group of drugs that require monitoring of kidney function tests and potassium levels over a trial period . Functions of Angiotensin II : Vasoconstriction Stimulation of aldosterone release from the adrenal glands. Direct hypertrophic and proliferative effects on cardiomyocytes and fibroblasts. Stimulation of NE release from sympathetic nerve endings and the adrenal medulla. ACE inhibitors benefit the cardiovascular system by blocking the synthesis of angiotensin II and preventing these actions. Inhibition of aldosterone receptors ( Option A) in kidneys- aldosterone antagonists (spironolactone, triamterine). Inhibiting beta-adrenergic (Option C) of the heart- beta-blockers (propranolol, metoprolol, nevibolol). Inhibits sodium glucose cotransporter-2 (Option D) in kidneys- SGLT-2 inhibitors (dapagliflozin, sotagliflozin).",

      "question": "A patient was admitted with chest pain, and the ECG is given in the image below. His blood report shows a troponin level of 210 ng/ml. Which of the following is less likely to be involved in managing this patient?",
      "options": {
        "A": "Ticagrelor",
        "B": "Enoxaparin",
        "C": "Tenecteplase",
        "D": "Bivalirudin"

      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "troponin levels (normal <4.5 ng/ml), is suggestive of non-ST elevation myocardial infarction ( NSTEMI ). Thrombolytics like tenecteplase will not be required in such cases. Management of NSTEMI: Initial management Oxygen Nitrates Morphine Loading lose (dual antiplatelets + statin) Definitive management Anticoagulation - one of the below Unfractionated heparin Enoxaparin ( low molecular weight heparin ) Bivalirudin ( direct thrombin inhibitor ) Fondaparinux ( factor Xa inhibitor ) Long-term management Lifestyle modifications Dual antiplatelets ACE inhibitors Beta-blockers Statins Oral hypoglycemics (if diabetic) Reference: Harrison Principles of Internal Medicine, 21st Edition, Page 2051",
