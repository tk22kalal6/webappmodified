      "question": "A 45-year-old male patient has hypertension and hypokalemia. His blood pressure is consistently elevated despite being on multiple antihypertensive medications. Laboratory tests reveal elevated plasma aldosterone concentration and suppressed plasma renin activity. A CT scan of the abdomen shows an adrenal adenoma. Which is the most appropriate pharmacologic treatment for this patient's condition?",
      "options": {
        "A": "Lisinopril",
        "B": "Hydrochlorothiazide",
        "C": "Amlodipine",
        "D": "Spironolactone"
      },
      "correct_answer": "D",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: D) Spironolactone Explanation : Primary hyperaldosteronism (Conn's syndrome) is characterised by excessive production of aldosterone from the adrenal glands, leading to hypertension and hypokalemia. Spironolactone, an aldosterone antagonist and a potassium-sparing diuretic, is the most appropriate drug of choice. Spironolactone: Aldosterone combines with an intracellular mineralocorticoid (MR) receptor and induces the formation of aldosterone-induced proteins (AIPs), which promote Na+ reabsorption. Spironolactone acts as a competitive antagonist and inhibits the formation of AIP by combining with MR. This prevents aldosterone from promoting sodium reabsorption and potassium excretion, which are the primary mechanisms by which aldosterone increases blood pressure and causes hypokalemia. Lisinopril (Option A) is an angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor that reduces aldosterone levels by inhibiting the production of angiotensin II. However, in primary hyperaldosteronism, there is an autonomous overproduction of aldosterone. Thus, lisinopril will be ineffective. Hydrochlorothiazide (Option B) is a thiazide diuretic that inhibits the reabsorption of sodium and potassium, thus hyperaldosteronism induced hypokalemia will be worsened. Amlodipine (Option C) is a calcium channel blocker that works by relaxing the smooth muscle. While effective for managing hypertension, it does not influence aldosterone levels or activity.

      "question": "Which of the following drugs is not used in the treatment of central diabetes insipidus?",
      "options": {
        "A": "Carbamazepine",
        "B": "Desmopressin",
        "C": "Chlorpropamide",
        "D": "Indomethacin"
      },
      "correct_answer": "D",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: D) Indomethacin Explanation : Indomethacin, a prostaglandin synthase inhibitor, is used for the treatment of nephrogenic diabetes insipidus , especially lithium-induced nephrogenic DI. It works by attenuating prostaglandin synthesis in the renal tubules, thereby potentiating the effects of antidiuretic hormone (ADH). Oral carbamazepine (Option A) has shown antidiuretic activity in patients with neurohypophyseal diabetes insipidus. It is suggested for initial use in neurohypophyseal diabetes insipidus if oral therapy is indicated, although its exact mechanism of antidiuretic action is unclear. Antidiuretic peptides (Option B) are the primary treatment for central DI, with desmopressin being the peptide of choice. Chlorpropamide (Option C), an oral sulfonylurea, potentiates the action of small or residual amounts of circulating vasopressin and reduces urine volume in more than half of all patients with central DI. If polyuria is not controlled satisfactorily with chlorpropamide alone, adding a thiazide diuretic to the regimen usually results in an adequate reduction in urine volume.

      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "SIADH Correct Answer : C). Targeted sodium correction should be >1mEq/L per hour in case of severe SIADH Explanation : Sodium correction should not increase 0.5-1mEq/L per hour, as it can cause severe consequences such as osmotic demyelination syndrome , which can even lead to quadriplegia.

Since ADH acts on V2 receptors which reabsorbs water, tolvaptan helps in improving volume overload status by blocking those receptors. Conivaptan (Option A) is FDA-approved for the treatment of hospitalised patients diagnosed with hypervolemic/euvolemic hyponatremia. It is also used in cases of emergency treatment of SIADH . Tolvaptan and mozavaptan are oral vasopressin antagonists used for long term management of the same. Tolvaptan (Option B) is given a Black box warning as it can cause serious consequences by rapidly correcting hyponatremia . It is also hepatotoxic , thus should be used for a maximum of 30 days and should not be used in patients with liver disease. Osmotic demyelination syndrome (Option C) can occur with the usage of vasopressin antagonists due to the risk of rapid correction of hyponatremia.

      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "tubules Correct Answer: A) Thiazides reduce urine output by increasing free water absorption in proximal tubules Explanation: Thiazide diuretics reduce polyuria in nephrogenic diabetes insipidus by inducing mild hypovolemia . This hypovolemia leads to increased sodium and water reabsorption in the proximal tubules , thereby reducing water delivery to the distal nephron . As a result, urine volume decreases despite the kidney's resistance to ADH. Mechanism of Action in Nephrogenic DI: Drug Mechanism Thiazide diuretics Induce mild volume depletion → ↑ proximal tubular reabsorption of water → ↓ urine output Amiloride Blocks ENaC channels in collecting ducts → ↓ lithium uptake → renal protection Lithium Causes nephrogenic DI by damaging ADH-sensitive pathways in collecting ducts Thiazides directly increase the sensitivity of the kidneys to ADH (Option B): Incorrect because nephrogenic DI is due to ADH resistance , and thiazides do not improve ADH sensitivity . Thiazides help to increase lithium excretion, reducing its nephrotoxic effects (Option C): Incorrect; thiazides actually increase lithium levels by reducing its clearance, potentially worsening toxicity . Thiazides decrease the risk of hypokalemia when used with amiloride (Option D): Incorrect because while amiloride reduces potassium loss , this is not the main reason for thiazide use in DI .

        "D": "Osmotic diuretics"
      },
      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: A) Loop diuretics Explanation : Involuntary hand twitching, along with perioral numbness, is suggestive of tetany due to hypocalcemia. High ceiling diuretics (loop diuretics), which are preferred in treating oedema (including resistant oedema and for rapid fluid mobilisation), impair the absorption of calcium ions, thus causing tetany. Loop diuretics like furosemide primarily inhibit the sodium-potassium-chloride cotransporter in the thick ascending limb of the loop of Henle. This inhibition disrupts the reabsorption of sodium, chloride, and water, which normally generates a positive potential gradient in the tubule's lumen. This gradient facilitates the reabsorption of calcium ions. However, when loop diuretics block this transporter, the potential gradient is disrupted, impairing calcium reabsorption and leading to increased urinary excretion, ultimately resulting in hypocalcemia. Common Adverse Effects of loop diuretics (also seen with Thiazides, except for Calcium) : Hyponatremia → Hypotension Hypokalemia → Muscle weakness increases the risk of digoxin toxicity Hypocalcemia → Tetany (Thiazides usually increase calcium levels) Hypomagnesemia → Pseudogout Decrease in H+ ions → Metabolic alkalosis Hyperuricemia → in high doses Hyperglycemia and dyslipidemia Ototoxicity Carbonic Anhydrase Inhibitors(Option B), such as acetazolamide, have a weak diuretic effect and are primarily used for conditions like glaucoma or altitude sickness, not for managing significant fluid overload in CHF or chronic renal failure. Thiazide Diuretics(Option C) are less effective than loop diuretics for severe oedema, especially in patients with chronic renal failure. They are typically used for mild to moderate oedema and maintenance therapy, not for rapid fluid mobilisation. Osmotic Diuretics(Option D), like mannitol, are used to reduce intracranial pressure or treat acute renal failure but are not suitable for the long-term management of chronic oedema.",

The metabolic acidosis induced by acetazolamide compensates for this alkalosis and helps stimulate ventilation , improving oxygenation and reducing symptoms of Acute Mountain Sickness (AMS) . Mechanism and effects in AMS: Parameter Change High altitude effect ↓ PaO I → ↑ ventilation → ↓ PaCO I → Respiratory alkalosis Acetazolamide effect Inhibits carbonic anhydrase → ↑ HCO II excretion Acid–base result Metabolic acidosis Clinical outcome Stimulates respiration, ↓ AMS symptoms Respiratory Alkalosis (Option B): Incorrect because this is the initial disturbance at high altitude due to hyperventilation—not the result of acetazolamide therapy. Respiratory Acidosis (Option C): Incorrect because acetazolamide does not impair ventilation or gas exchange; it does not increase PaCO I . Metabolic Alkalosis (Option D): Incorrect because acetazolamide causes loss of bicarbonate , resulting in metabolic acidosis , not alkalosis.",

      "correct_answer": "D",
      "explanation": "fatigue and palpitations after being started on a diuretic. These symptoms suggest hypokalemia, and his ABG shows metabolic acidosis, which suggests the use of a carbonic anhydrase inhibitor, which is commonly used in glaucoma. Diuretics causing maximum potassium loss: Carbonic anhydrase inhibitors cause the most potassium loss, followed by thiazides (Option B) , loop diuretics (Option A) , and osmotic diuretics (Option C) .metabolic alkalosis is seen with thiazides and loops Diuretics causing maximum sodium loss: Loop diuretics lead to the greatest sodium loss, followed by thiazides, osmotic diuretics, carbonic anhydrase inhibitors, and potassium-sparing diuretics.
