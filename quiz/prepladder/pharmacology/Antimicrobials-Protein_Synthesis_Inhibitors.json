      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: A) Tetracyclines Explanation: Tetracyclines are contraindicated in pregnancy, lactation, and children due to the risk of calcium-tetracycline chelation, which can lead to permanent yellowish discolouration of teeth and inhibited bone growth. It should also be avoided with dairy products as they reduce drug absorption. Contraindication of tetracycline : Pregnancy Children During lactation Renal failure (Except Doxyxline) Adverse effects of tetracycline are: Acute hepatic necrosis: seen in pregnancy Fanconi syndrome Photosensitivity Permanent discolouration of teeth (due to in-utero exposure) Delayed growth Diabetes insipidus Rarely, â†‘ ICP in children/pseudotumor cerebri Vestibulotoxic (minocycline) Exfoliative dermatitis (hypersensitivity reaction) Amikacin (Option B) is also contraindicated during pregnancy due to potential ototoxicity and nephrotoxicity, but it does not affect bone growth or tooth colour. Chloramphenicol (Option C) is contraindicated in pregnancy due to the risk of 'grey baby syndrome', which can lead to severe symptoms like hypotonia, distended abdomen, cyanosis, and cardiovascular collapse. Sulfonamide ( Option D) is a sulfa drug that displaces bilirubin from albumin, leading to unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia, which leads to kernicterus. Thus, it should be avoided during pregnancy and in neonates. Reference: K D Tripathi, Essentials of Medical Pharmacology, 8th edition, Pages 756, 784-792",

Explanations: Streptogramins (e.g., quinupristin-dalfopristin) are bacteriostatic agents that work by binding to the 50S ribosomal subunit . This binding inhibits protein synthesis and results in a synergistic effect , making the combination bactericidal against many Gram-positive organisms.

      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: A) Inactivation of the drug by bacterial enzymes Explanation: Aminoglycoside resistance typically involves modification by bacterial enzymes like acetyltransferases, phosphotransferases, and nucleotidyltransferases. These enzymes alter aminoglycosides, preventing their binding to bacterial ribosomes and blocking protein synthesis. This resistance mechanism is common in multidrug-resistant bacteria, including those causing urinary tract infections (UTIs).
