        "D": "Estrogen"
      },
      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer A - Pulsatile GnRH Cryptorchidism (undescended testes) can be treated with pulsatile GnRH (Gonadotropin-releasing hormone). Pulsatile GnRH stimulates the release of LH and FSH, which in turn can promote testicular descent by stimulating testosterone production. Non-pulsatile GnRH (Option B) does not stimulate the release of LH and FSH in the same way as pulsatile GnRH, making it ineffective for treating cryptorchidism. Testosterone (Option C) is not typically used to treat cryptorchidism. Although it is involved in the process, direct administration of testosterone does not encourage testicular descent. Estrogen (Option D) is not used in the treatment of cryptorchidism; it is used for other hormonal purposes such as contraceptives or menopause management.

      "explanation": "which is responsible for converting testosterone into dihydrotestosterone (DHT). DHT is a potent androgen that plays a key role in the development of male-pattern baldness and the enlargement of the prostate. By inhibiting this enzyme, it reduces the levels of DHT, which can help prevent hair loss and shrink the prostate in affected individuals. (Statement 1) It reduces PSA levels primarily by lowering DHT, which in turn reduces the size and activity of the prostate. (Statement 4) (Statement 2 ruled out) It does not reduce testosterone levels , they only block the conversion of testosterone to DHT, so testosterone levels usually remain the same or only slightly affected.

      "question": "Which of the following anti-diabetic drugs is associated with the increased risk of fractures?",
      "options": {
        "A": "Rosiglitazone",
        "B": "Liraglutide",

        "D": "Metformin"
      },
      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "Correct answer: A) Rosiglitazone Explanation: Rosiglitazone is associated with an increased risk of fractures, particularly in women, due to reduced bone formation and increased bone resorption. Adverse Effects of Thiazolidinediones (Pioglitazone, Rosiglitazone): Weight Gain and Edema: Common adverse effects; average weight gain of 2–4 kg in the first year. Weight gain and edema are more pronounced when combined with insulin. Fluid Retention: Dose-related; contributes to reduced hematocrit. Macular edema reported with both rosiglitazone and pioglitazone. Heart Failure Risk: Long-term use associated with up to a 2-fold increased risk. Due to plasma volume expansion, not reduced myocardial contractility. Contraindicated in moderate-to-severe heart failure. Use cautiously in patients with compensated heart failure, especially with insulin. Cardiovascular Events: Rosiglitazone: Previously restricted due to concerns about MI/stroke; later data show neutral effect. Pioglitazone: Mildly reduces risk of cardiovascular events; showed benefit in preventing stroke, MI, and diabetes in insulin-resistant patients. Bone Fracture Risk: Increased in women. Consider osteoporosis risk before starting. Liver Effects: Pioglitazone and rosiglitazone lower transaminases; reduce hepatic steatosis. Effective in nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH). Rare cases of liver injury reported; contraindicated in active liver disease. Reference: Goodman and Gilman Pharmacological Basis of Therapeutics, 14th Edition, Page 1037",

      "question": "A patient who is on treatment for hyperlipidemia develops gallstones. What is the mechanism of action of the causative drug that was given to this patient?",
      "options": {
        "A": "Inhibitis HMG CoA reductase",
        "B": "Activates PPAR alpha",
        "C": "Blinds to deoxycholic acid",
        "D": "Decrease VLDL"
      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: B) Activates PPAR alpha Explanation: The causative drug here is likely a fibrate , which is commonly used to treat hyperlipidemia. Fibrates , such as fenofibrate and gemfibrozil , activate PPAR-alpha (peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor alpha), a transcription factor involved in regulating lipid and glucose metabolism . PPAR activation leads to increased expression of enzymes involved in fatty acid oxidation and decreased expression of enzymes involved in triglyceride synthesis and VLDL secretion. All fibrates increase bile lithogenicity, and increase the incidence of gallstones. Inhibits HMG CoA reductase (Option A) : Statins work by inhibiting HMG CoA reductase , which is the rate-limiting enzyme in cholesterol synthesis. Major side effects are myopathy and derangement of LFTs. They do not typically cause gallstones. Blinds to deoxycholic acid (Option C) : Deoxycholic acid is a bile acid that is involved in the emulsification and absorption of dietary fat. Bile acid sequestrants bind to bile acids in the GI contents and prevent their reabsorption. They do not have a high risk of gallstones associated with them. Decrease VLDL (Option D) : Decreases VLDL is the mechanism of action of some lipid-lowering drugs, such as niacin and omega-3 fatty acids. While decreasing VLDL can have beneficial effects on lipid metabolism, it does not have a similar risk of gallstones formation as fibrates.

      "question": "A 45-year-old obese lady with diabetes, managed with oral hypoglycemic agents, now presents to the casualty with a hypoglycemic episode. Which of the following drugs is most likely responsible for her hypoglycemic episode?",
      "options": {
        "A": "Metformin",
        "B": "Pioglitazone",
        "C": "Sitagliptin",
        "D": "Glimepiride"
      },
      "correct_answer": "D",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer D - Glimepiride Glimepiride, a sulfonylurea, increases insulin secretion from the pancreas and carries a high risk of hypoglycemia, particularly with inadequate food intake or dose mismatch. This drug is most likely responsible for the hypoglycemic episode. Sulfonylureas Generation Drug Special Points First Generation Higher risk of hypoglycemia Less commonly used Tolbutamide Short-acting Lower potency Chlorpropamide Long-acting Antidiuretic effects. Tolazamide Intermediate duration More potent. Second Generation More potent than first-generation drugs Glibenclamide longer duration There is a higher risk of hypoglycemia compared to other second-generation. Glipizide Shorter half-life Lower risk of hypoglycemia Preferable in elderly patients or those with renal impairment. Glimepiride Once-daily dosing, Lower risk of hypoglycemia Most Potent In second-generation sulfonylureas. Gliclazide Considered safer regarding hypoglycemia, Antioxidative properties may improve microvascular outcomes. Metformin (Option A) is not associated with hypoglycemia. It works by reducing hepatic glucose production and improving insulin sensitivity, and is considered a safe option in terms of hypoglycemic risk. Pioglitazone (Option B) is a thiazolidinedione that works by improving insulin sensitivity. It does not typically cause hypoglycemia, as it does not directly increase insulin secretion. Sitagliptin (Option C) is a DPP-4 inhibitor that works by increasing incretin levels, which helps to regulate insulin release. It does not generally cause hypoglycemia unless used in combination with other drugs that increase insulin secretion, like sulfonylureas.

      },
      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer C - Goserelin The patient's elevated PSA, urinary symptoms, and radiographic findings (bony lesions and lymph node enlargement) are consistent with metastatic prostate cancer. Goserelin is a gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) agonist used in the treatment of prostate cancer. It works by reducing testosterone levels, which can slow the growth of prostate cancer cells. GnRH antagonist GnRH agonist Mechanism of action GnRH antagonist ↓ Blocks the GnRH receptor in the pituitary ↓ Decreased FSH and LH levels ↓ Decreased Estrogen and Progesterone They have a lower risk of ovarian hyperstimulation. They offer complete suppression of endogenous gonadotropins. GnRH agonist ↓ Initial stimulation of gonadotropin release ↓ Downregulation of GnRH receptors ↓ Suppression of gonadotropin release Recovery occurs after 2-3 months of the stoppage of medication. Drugs Cetrorelix Ganirelix Degarelix Abarelix Elagolix Leuprolide Goserelin Histrelin Buserelin Triptorelin Uses Prostate cancer. Endometriosis. In Vitro Fertilization (Suppression of endogenous Gonadotropin before administration of exogenous hormones). Delayed puberty Precocious puberty Anovulation Endometriosis GnRH elicits different responses based on the administration of the drug: Intermittent injection Continuous injection Mechanism of action This is used when increased gonadotropin secretion is needed. As an agonist, its initial action stimulates the GnRH receptors , resulting in the release of gonadotropins. This is preferred when decreased levels of gonadotropins or sex hormones are needed. Continuous stimulation results in a negative feedback mechanism on the receptors, leading to their downregulation . Uses DOC in Delayed puberty. Azoospermia (Male Infertility). Anovulation (Female Infertility). DOC in Prostate carcinoma. DOC in Precocious puberty. Endometriosis. Adverse effects Increased size of the ovary may lead to pain in the abdomen. Rupture of the ovary: Hemoperitoneum. Postmenopausal symptoms include hot flashes, Osteoporosis and Depression. Anastrozole (Option A) is an aromatase inhibitor used mainly in the treatment of breast cancer, particularly in postmenopausal women. It is not typically used for prostate cancer. Desogestrel (Option B) is a synthetic progestin used in contraceptives and hormone replacement therapy. It has no role in the treatment of prostate cancer. Oxandrolone (Option D) is an anabolic steroid used for weight gain and muscle strength, not for the treatment of prostate cancer. It does not address the underlying hormonal mechanisms involved in prostate cancer progression. Reference: KD Tripathi Essentials of Medical Pharmacology, 8th Edition, Page 264,265",

        "D": "Iodine-123"
      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer B - Iodine-131 Iodine-131 is the radioactive isotope most commonly used in the treatment of thyroid cancer. It emits both beta radiation (which helps in destroying thyroid cancer cells) and gamma radiation (which is used for diagnostic imaging). Therefore, it is used for both therapeutic and diagnostic purposes in thyroid disorders. Iodine-131 (I-131): Physical Half-life: 8 days. Radiation Emission: Emits beta particles (for therapeutic effect) and gamma rays (for diagnostic imaging). Uses: Diagnostic: I-131 is used in low doses (25-100 µCi) for thyroid scans to assess thyroid function. Therapeutic: I-131 is used to treat hyperthyroidism (e.g., Graves' disease, toxic nodular goitre) and metastatic thyroid cancer. Mechanism of Action: Concentration in Thyroid: Iodine-131 is concentrated in the thyroid gland, where beta particles destroy thyroid cells, leading to necrosis and fibrosis. Effect on Hyperthyroidism: Gradual onset, typically requiring 2-3 months for full therapeutic effect. Iodine-125 (Option A): Primarily used in radiotherapy for cancers and for brachytherapy (internal radiation treatment). It has a much longer half-life and lower energy radiation compared to Iodine-131, making it suitable for localized therapy. Iodine-127 (Option C): This is the stable, naturally occurring isotope of iodine and is not radioactive. It does not have any therapeutic or diagnostic application in radioactive iodine therapy. Iodine-123 (Option D): A diagnostic isotope used in scintigraphy or thyroid imaging . It emits gamma rays and is commonly used for thyroid scans to assess thyroid function without the therapeutic effects seen with Iodine-131.

      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: B) Linagliptin Explanation: Linagliptin is a DPP-4 inhibitor used for the treatment of type 2 diabetes. It is excreted primarily through the liver; hence, it does not require any dose adjustments in patients with CKD. In patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD), dose adjustments of diabetes medications are often necessary due to impaired renal function, which can affect the clearance of certain drugs.

Therefore, dose adjustment is still required in those with CKD. Glyburide (Option C) is a sulfonylurea drug that is predominantly metabolised in the liver and excreted in the urine. It requires renal dose adjustment in patients with CKD because its clearance is significantly affected by renal function, and accumulation can lead to hypoglycemia.

Sibutramine was usually taken orally and was usually prescribed along with a healthy diet and exercise to manage obesity in the long term. Fenfluramine (Option D) is a serotonergic anorectic agent that reduces food cravings due to increased serotonergic transmission in the hypothalamus. Due to severe side effects, it has now been banned by the US FDA. Reference: Goodman and Gilman's The Pharmacological Basis of Therapeutics, 13th Edition, Page 875-877",

        "D": "Oral vitamin D3 is given along with oral calcium"
      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: B) Bisphosphonates are not given for more than a year Explanation : Bisphosphonates can be safely used for longer durations (typically 3–5 years) in most patients, with periodic evaluation to assess efficacy and risk of adverse effects like osteonecrosis of the jaw or atypical fractures. The patient's history of a pathological wrist fracture, combined with her T-scores, leads to the diagnosis of osteoporosis, which increases the risk of future fractures. Bisphosphonates are considered the drug of choice for the treatment of osteoporosis . The most commonly used bisphosphonates include Alendronate, Risedronate, Ibandronate , and Zoledronic acid. While the duration of treatment may vary depending on the individual's response and specific circumstances, bisphosphonates can be prescribed for several years to maintain bone density and reduce the risk of fractures. It can last up to 10 years, and beyond that, it increases the risk of femur fracture. Mechanism of action: Uses of Bisphosphonates: Condition Role of Bisphosphonates Osteoporosis Effective in preventing and treating postmenopausal osteoporosis, age-related, idiopathic, and steroid-induced osteoporosis. Paget's Disease Arrest osteolytic lesions, reduce bone pain, and improve secondary symptoms. Hypercalcemia of Malignancy Lower serum calcium levels, especially in severe cases. Metastatic Bone Disease Arrest osteolytic lesions and reduce bone pain. Teriparatide (Option A) is a recombinant form of parathyroid hormone (PTH) and is often considered a first-line treatment option for severe osteoporosis. It stimulates new bone formation and is typically prescribed before bisphosphonates if the patient has severe osteoporosis or has experienced a recent fragility fracture. Calcium requirement is 1200 mg per day (Option C), as the recommended daily intake of calcium for postmenopausal women is generally 1200 mg. Adequate calcium intake is important for maintaining bone health and preventing osteoporosis. Oral vitamin D3 (Option D) is given along with oral calcium, as Vitamin D plays a crucial role in calcium absorption and bone health. Postmenopausal women with osteoporosis often require supplemental vitamin D to ensure optimal calcium absorption. Vitamin D3 is the preferred form of vitamin D supplementation.",

Aspect Tamoxifen MOA Estrogen Receptor (ER) Antagonist ↓ Binds to ER ↓ Tissue-specific effects such as : Antagonist in breast tissue (prevents estrogen binding). Agonist in bone and cardiovascular tissues (estrogen-like effects) Clinical Use Drug of choice for ER-positive breast cancer. Decrease the risk of contralateral breast cancer. Side Effects Increased risk of endometrial cancer. Thromboembolism Hot flashes Depression Hepatotoxicity Cataracts. Drug Interactions It should not be combined with fluoxetine and other SSRIs. SSRIs inhibit the CYP2D6 enzyme, essential for converting tamoxifen into its active form, endoxifen. This interaction may lower endoxifen levels, diminishing tamoxifen's effectiveness against estrogen receptor-positive breast cancer. Incorrect Options: Estrogen (Option A) is a steroid hormone associated with the female reproductive organs and is responsible for developing female sexual characteristics. Estrogen or estradiol is the most common form of estrogen hormone for FDA-approved treatment as hormone replacement therapy in managing symptoms associated with menopause. It stimulates all estrogen receptors in all tissues. Metformin (Option B) is a biguanide compound that is used for the treatment of diabetes, PCOS, and insulin resistance. Metformin can inhibit 17ß-estradiol-stimulated cell proliferation and the expression of estrogen receptors in a dose-dependent manner in cancer cells. Adriamycin (Option D) is used alone or with other drugs to treat many types of cancer, including leukemia, lymphoma, neuroblastoma, sarcoma, Wilms tumor, and certain cancers of the lung, breast, stomach, ovary, thyroid, and bladder.

        "D": "Stimulation of PPAR-gamma"
      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "belongs to a class of drugs called incretin mimetics or glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor agonists. The mechanism of action of exenatide involves acting as an agonist of GLP-1 receptors. GLP-1 is a naturally occurring hormone that is released from the intestine in response to food intake. It plays a crucial role in regulating glucose metabolism. By acting as a GLP-1 receptor agonist, exenatide mimics the effects of GLP-1 and enhances its activity. When exenatide binds to GLP-1 receptors, it stimulates the release of insulin from pancreatic beta cells. Insulin helps to lower blood sugar levels by promoting the uptake of glucose into cells and reducing the production of glucose by the liver. Additionally, exenatide suppresses the release of glucagon, which is a hormone that raises blood sugar levels. By inhibiting glucagon release, exenatide helps to further control blood glucose levels. Incorrect Option: Option A) Inhibition of DPP-4: Dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) inhibitors are another class of medications used in the treatment of type 2 diabetes. These drugs work by inhibiting the enzyme DPP-4, which breaks down GLP-1 and other incretin hormones. However, exenatide is not a DPP-4 inhibitor. Option C) Inhibiting intestinal absorption of carbohydrates: This mechanism of action is associated with medications called alpha-glucosidase inhibitors, such as acarbose and miglitol. These drugs work by inhibiting enzymes in the intestines that break down carbohydrates, thereby reducing the absorption of glucose. Exenatide does not act through this mechanism. Option D) Stimulation of PPAR-gamma: Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma (PPAR-gamma) agonists, such as pioglitazone and rosiglitazone, are a class of medications used in the treatment of type 2 diabetes. They work by activating PPAR-gamma receptors, which helps improve insulin sensitivity and reduce insulin resistance. Exenatide does not stimulate PPAR-gamma receptors.",

      },
      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "(e.g., empagliflozin, dapagliflozin ) are preferred for diabetes management in patients with cardiac and renal failure due to their cardioprotective and renoprotective benefits. Cardiovascular Benefits: Reduce heart failure hospitalisation (especially in HF with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF) ). Lower major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) in high-risk patients. Renal Benefits: Slow progression of diabetic nephropathy . Reduce albuminuria and preserve glomerular function. Diabetic patients with heart failure best benefit from adding a group of drugs called SGLT-2 (sodium-glucose cotransporter-2) inhibitors, and empagliflozin falls in this group. By inhibiting the SGLT-2 receptors in the proximal tubule of the kidneys, glucose (and sodium) reabsorption can be prevented. Since both sodium and glucose are osmotic molecules, increasing their excretion draws out more water, making these drugs effective in patients with heart failure. Drugs: Dapagliflozin. Empagliflozin. Canagliflozin. Ertugliflozin. Side effects: Infections (vaginal thrush, balanoposthitis, Fournier’s gangrene) : Favour the growth of microbes in the lower urinary tract by providing an environment of excessive glucose. Euglycemic ketoacidosis is due to inhibiting glucose reabsorption and the body’s preference for ketone bodies as an energy source after excess glucose excretion. Osteoporosis: Rarely due to loss of calcium ions upon inhibition of the SGLT-2 receptors. Pioglitazone (Option B) is incorrect because pioglitazone (a thiazolidinedione, TZD) causes fluid retention , worsening heart failure . Metformin (Option C) is incorrect because although it is the first-line drug for type 2 diabetes , it is contraindicated in severe renal failure (eGFR <30 mL/min/1.73m²) due to the risk of lactic acidosis . Sulfonylureas (Option D) is incorrect because sulfonylureas (e.g., glibenclamide, glipizide) increase hypoglycemia risk , especially in renal impairment due to reduced clearance.

      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: A) Sulfonylureas Explanation: Sulfonylureas are insulin secretagogues that stimulate the pancreas to release more insulin, which can lead to an increased risk of hypoglycemia , especially when used in monotherapy, particularly if the patient skips meals, exercises excessively, or has altered insulin sensitivity. Sulfonylureas Site of Action Pancreatic β cells Uses Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus Mechanism of Action Sulfonylureas I Bind to Receptors on Pancreatic β Cells I Closure of ATP-sensitive K + Channels I Membrane depolarization I Opening of Voltage-Gated Ca².+ Channels I Ca² + Influx I Exocytosis of Insulin Granules I Increased Insulin Secretion I Lower Blood Glucose Levels. Drugs 1st Generation Tolbutamide Chlorpropamide 2nd Generation Glibenclamide Glipizide Gliclazide Glimepiride Incorrect Options: Metformin (Option B) primarily decreases hepatic glucose production and increases insulin sensitivity in peripheral tissues. It does not stimulate insulin release from pancreatic beta cells. Hypoglycemia is unlikely with metformin unless it is combined with other medications like sulfonylureas or insulin. Acarbose (Option C) is an alpha-glucosidase inhibitor that works by slowing down the digestion and absorption of carbohydrates in the small intestine. It does not cause hypoglycemia on its own and is not associated with hypoglycemic events. Pioglitazone (Option D) is a thiazolidinedione that improves insulin sensitivity by acting as an agonist for the(PPAR- γ ). This results in increased glucose uptake in muscle and adipose tissue and decreased glucose production in the liver. It does not cause hypoglycemia when used alone.

      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: C) Gliflozins Explanation: Gliflozins , also known as SGLT2 inhibitors , inhibit the sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 in the proximal renal tubules. SGLT2 is a low-affinity, high-capacity sodium-glucose cotransporter that is responsible for reabsorbing approximately 90% of filtered glucose in the proximal tubule. Gliflozins reduce glucose reabsorption and increase glucose excretion in the urine .The presence of excess glucose in the urine creates an environment conducive to the growth of fungi, thereby increasing the risk of infections such as vaginal candidiasis. It includes drugs that end with word - flozin : Dapagliflozin, Empagliflozin, Canagliflozin, Ertugliflozin. Incorrect Options: Acarbose (Option A) works by inhibiting enzymes that break down carbohydrates in the intestines, thus slowing glucose absorption and lowering postprandial blood sugar levels. It does not impact the urinary glucose concentration and is not associated with an increased risk of UTIs. Metformin (Option B) is a biguanide and the most commonly used first-line medication for type 2 diabetes. It works by reducing liver glucose production and improving insulin sensitivity . It does not increase the risk of vaginal candidiasis. Linagliptin (Option D) is a DPP-4 inhibitor that increases incretin hormones, which help to increase insulin release and decrease glucagon release.

      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer A - Canagliflozin The described scenario of itching around the vulvovaginal area after starting anti-diabetic medication suggests vulvovaginal pruritus. Canagliflozin has been linked to vulvovaginal pruritus (itching) caused by candidiasis. It belongs to the class of medications known as sodium-glucose co-transporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors. These drugs work by reducing glucose reabsorption in the kidneys, leading to increased glucose excretion in the urine. Vulvovaginal candidiasis is common (ncreased excretion of sugar in the urine). The sugar promotes the growth of pathogens like candida, resulting in: Vulvovaginal pruritis (pruritus in the genital area, including the vulva and vagina). UTI (urinary tract infection) Fournier's gangrene. Metformin (Option B) belongs to the class biguanide, which is an oral anti-diabetic medication that stimulates the AMPK enzyme, inhibits hepatic glucose production, and increases peripheral insulin sensitivity. It can lead to adverse effects like megaloblastic anaemia and lactic acidosis. Linagliptin (Option C) is a DPP-4 inhibitor that increases the secretion of Insulin from the pancreas in response to meals (there is no risk of hypoglycemia) and reduces the Secretion of glucose. Liraglutide (Option D) is a GLP-1 (glucagon-like peptide-1) analogue that enhances insulin secretion in response to food intake and helps manage postprandial blood glucose levels. It can cause gallstones, pancreatitis, and risk of Pancreatic and thyroid cancer (contraindicated in MEN syndrome). Reference: KD Tripathi Essentials of Pharmacology, 8th Edition, Page 301.",

      "correct_answer": "D",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer D - Alogliptin Alogliptin is an oral medication classified as a Dipeptidyl Peptidase-4 (DPP-4) Inhibitor , which increase levels of GIP and GLP-1 while reducing glucagon. This oral drug helps lower both pre- and postprandial glucose levels. Mechanism: Acts by inhibiting the enzyme DPP-4, which breaks down incretin hormones such as GLP-1 and GIP. By inhibiting DPP-4, alogliptin increases the levels of GLP-1 and GIP, which stimulate insulin secretion and reduce glucagon secretion. This helps lower blood sugar levels. They are also known to reduce HbA1c levels in patients with diabetes, making it a suitable option based on the provided information of high GIP and GLP1 levels along with low glucagon levels. Drugs : Linagliptin (safe in renal failure) Teneligliptin (safe in renal failure) Vildagliptin (hepatotoxic) Alogliptin Sitagliptin Saxagliptin Side effects: Nausea and vomiting (most common) Pancreatitis (lesser than GLP-1) Risk of pancreatic and thyroid cancer (lesser than GLP-1) Arthritis, Nasopharyngitis: Increase interleukins and cytokines levels (similar structure to CD26) Hypersensitivity reactions: Steven-Johnson syndrome, angioedema Liraglutide (Options A) is a medication in the class of glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor agonists, which help lower blood sugar levels by increasing insulin secretion, reducing glucagon secretion, slowing gastric emptying, and promoting satiety. It also reduces HbA1c levels and body’s GLP-1 production. The information provided about high GIP (gastric inhibitory peptide) levels and low glucagon levels does not directly indicate the use of liraglutide. Therefore, it is not the most suitable option in this scenario. Pramlintide (Option B) is an injectable medication used in the treatment of type 1 and type 2 diabetes. It is a synthetic analog of amylin, a hormone involved in glucose regulation. It helps to lower blood sugar levels by reducing the secretion of glucagon, slowing gastric emptying, and promoting satiety. However, it has no effect on GLP-1 levels. Voglibose (Option C) is an oral medication that belongs to the class of alpha-glucosidase inhibitors. It works by inhibiting the enzymes in the intestines that break down carbohydrates, thereby delaying the absorption of glucose and reducing postprandial (after meal) blood sugar spikes. It does not directly affect GLP-1, GIP, or glucagon levels. Therefore, it may not be the most suitable option based on the information provided.

By blocking alpha receptors, it prevents the vasoconstrictor effects of catecholamines, reducing the risk of hypertensive crises during surgery. It is initiated before surgery to ensure adequate alpha blockade and blood pressure control. Incorrect Options: Option A - Captopril: Captopril is an angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor used to treat hypertension by blocking the conversion of angiotensin I to angiotensin II, a potent vasoconstrictor. However, it is not commonly used as the primary preoperative medication for pheochromocytoma. Other options are more effective in managing the condition. Option B - Propranolol: Propranolol is a beta-blocker that blocks the effects of adrenaline and noradrenaline on beta receptors, leading to decreased heart rate and blood pressure. While it can be used in combination with other medications for preoperative management of pheochromocytoma, it is not the preferred initial choice due to the risk of unopposed alpha-adrenergic stimulation, which can worsen hypertensive crises. Option C - Nifedipine: Nifedipine is a calcium channel blocker that relaxes blood vessels and reduces blood pressure.

      },
      "correct_answer": "D",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: D) Aspirin Aspirin is an antiplatelet drug that displaces thyroxine from thyroxine-binding globulin and increases free T3 and T4 levels ,which can be dangerous and worsen thyroid storm. Management of thyroid storm: Large doses of propylthiouracil (500–1000 mg loading dose and 250 mg every 4 h) should be given orally or by nasogastric tube or per rectum; the drug’s inhibitory action on T4 → T3 conversion makes it the antithyroid drug of choice. If not available, methimazole can be used in doses of 20 mg every 6 h. One hour after the first dose of propylthiouracil, stable iodide (5 drops SSKI every 6 h) is given to block thyroid hormone synthesis via the Wolff-Chaikoff effect (the delay allows the antithyroid drug to prevent the excess iodine from being incorporated into new hormone). Propranolol should also be given to reduce tachycardia and other adrenergic manifestations (60–80 mg PO every 4 h, or 2 mg IV every 4 h). Although other β -adrenergic blockers can be used, high doses of propranolol decrease T4 → T3 conversion, and the doses can be easily adjusted. Short-acting IV esmolol can be used to decrease heart rate while monitoring for signs of heart failure. Additional therapeutic measures include glucocorticoids (e.g., hydrocortisone 300 mg IV bolus, then 100 mg every 8 h), antibiotics if infection is present, cholestyramine to sequester thyroid hormones, cooling, oxygen, and IV fluids. Propranolol (Option A): Beta blockers are indicated to manage tachycardia in patients with thyroid storm. Lugol’s Iodine (Option B) inhibits further release of thyroxine.

RTKs are transmembrane proteins that span the cell membrane. They have an extracellular domain that binds specific ligands and an intracellular domain that possesses tyrosine kinase activity. Upon ligand binding, RTKs undergo dimerization and activation of their kinase domains, leading to the phosphorylation of tyrosine residues on the receptor itself and downstream signaling molecules. This phosphorylation initiates signaling cascades that regulate various cellular processes. Option C - Ion channel receptor: Ion channel receptors are transmembrane proteins that form channels allowing the passage of ions across the cell membrane. When a ligand binds to these receptors, the channel opens or closes, regulating the flow of specific ions such as sodium (Na + ), potassium (K + ), calcium (Ca 2+ ), or chloride (Cl - ). The opening or closing of ion channels can influence membrane potential and affect cellular excitability, neurotransmission, muscle contraction, and other physiological processes. Option D - G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR): GPCRs, also known as seven-transmembrane receptors, are transmembrane proteins that traverse the cell membrane seven times. They are coupled to intracellular G proteins, which are involved in signal transduction pathways. Ligand binding to a GPCR induces conformational changes that activate the associated G protein, leading to the modulation of intracellular second messenger systems and downstream signaling cascades. GPCRs play a crucial role in regulating diverse physiological processes, including neurotransmission, hormone signaling, and sensory perception. Reference: Prepladder Notes",

      "options": {
        "A": "To make it long acting",
        "B": "To make it short acting",
        "C": "To make is fast acting",
        "D": "Addition of zinc make the insulin effective orally"
      },
      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "preparations for the treatment of diabetes mellitus is to make it long acting. Insulin is a hormone that regulates blood sugar levels, and its action can be modified by adding certain substances. Zinc is one such substance that can be added to insulin to prolong its duration of action. When zinc is added to insulin, it forms crystals that delay the absorption of insulin from the injection site into the bloodstream. This delayed absorption results in a slower and more prolonged release of insulin, leading to a long-acting effect. Long-acting insulin formulations are used to provide a steady basal level of insulin throughout the day, mimicking the body's natural insulin secretion patterns. Incorrect Options: Option B - To make it short acting: Adding zinc to insulin does not make it short acting. Instead, it has the opposite effect of prolonging its duration of action. Option C - To make it fast acting: Adding zinc to insulin does not make it fast acting. Fast-acting insulins, such as rapid-acting or short-acting insulins, are formulated differently to provide a rapid onset of action and shorter duration. Option D - Addition of zinc makes the insulin effective orally: Adding zinc to insulin does not make it effective when taken orally. Insulin cannot be taken orally as it is broken down by digestive enzymes in the gastrointestinal tract. Insulin must be administered via subcutaneous injection or other suitable routes to be effective. Reference: Prepladder Notes",

      "options": {
        "A": "It activates phospholipase A",
        "B": "It acts on transcription factor",
        "C": "It acts by increasing cAMP",
        "D": "It is a tyrosine kinase receptor"
      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "transcription factors. When T3 and T4 bind to their nuclear receptors, they act as ligands to activate gene transcription. This leads to the production of specific proteins, including transcription factors, which can then regulate the expression of genes involved in thyroid hormone feedback control. Incorrect Options: Option A - It activates phospholipase A: T3 and T4, which are thyroid hormones, do not activate phospholipase A. Phospholipase A is an enzyme involved in the breakdown of phospholipids, and its activation is not directly associated with the actions of T3 and T4 on TRH (thyrotropin-releasing hormone). Option C - It acts by increasing cAMP: The action of T3 and T4 on TRH does not involve the direct increase of cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP). cAMP is a second messenger that is involved in various cellular signaling pathways, but it is not the primary mechanism through which T3 and T4 act on TRH. Option D - It is a tyrosine kinase receptor: T3 and T4 do not act on TRH through a tyrosine kinase receptor. Tyrosine kinase receptors are a type of cell surface receptor involved in various signaling pathways, but they are not directly involved in the regulation of TRH by T3 and T4.

It promotes water excretion without affecting sodium levels . Tolvaptan has been shown to be effective in treating chronic SIADH. Incorrect Options: Option B - Reducing fluid intake to <500 ml per day : While reducing fluid intake may help manage symptoms of fluid overload in some cases, it is not considered the primary treatment for chronic SIADH. Limiting fluid intake should be done cautiously and under medical supervision to prevent dehydration and electrolyte imbalances. Option C - Demeclocycline : Demeclocycline is an antibiotic that has been used in the past for SIADH due to its ability to inhibit the action of antidiuretic hormone. However, it is no longer considered a first-line treatment due to concerns about its side effects, including nephrotoxicity and hepatotoxicity. Other treatment options, such as tolvaptan, have shown better efficacy and safety profiles. Option D - Fludrocortisone : Fludrocortisone is a synthetic mineralocorticoid that acts on the kidneys to increase sodium reabsorption and fluid retention. It is not recommended as a first-line treatment for SIADH because it may worsen hyponatremia (low sodium levels) and fluid overload. Reference: Prepladder Notes",
