      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Correct answer: B) Porphyria is a relative contraindication for thiopentone Explanation: Porphyria is not a relative contraindication but an absolute contraindication for the use of Thiopentone due to the risk of inducing acute porphyric crisis. Contraindications for thiopentone: Absolute Relative Porphyria Heart Blocks Hypotension Asthma Thiopentone decreases intracranial pressure, making it suitable for neurosurgical procedures (Option A): Thiopentone, an intravenous barbiturate, is used as an induction agent of choice for neurosurgeries for the following reasons: Causes maximum decrease in ICP Anticonvulsant properties Decreases cerebral metabolic rate Maximum neuroprotective among IV anaesthetics The mechanism for termination of action is by redistribution from brain to fat cells (Option C): The primary mechanism for the termination of its action is redistribution from the brain to fat and muscle tissues. Mechanism of Termination Redistribution from the brain to fat and muscle tissues Metabolism Metabolised in the liver by hydroxylation Excretion Excreted by the kidneys Thiopentone has antithyroid properties and thus is an agent of choice for hyperthyroid patients (Option D): Thiopentone has antithyroid properties, making it an induction agent of choice for hyperthyroid patients.

      "question": "A 45 year old male undergoes a minor surgical procedure for lipoma excision under local anesthesia with bupivacaine. Shortly after administration, he complains of tinnitus, dizziness and a metallic taste in his mouth. What is the most appropriate treatment for this patient's condition?",
      "options": {
        "A": "Intravenous atropine",
        "B": "Intravenous epinephrine",
        "C": "20% lipid emulsion therapy",
        "D": "Intravenous sodium bicarbonate"
      },
      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Correct answer: C) 20% lipid emulsion therapy Explanation: 20% lipid emulsion therapy is the most appropriate treatment for bupivacaine toxicity. Lipid emulsion acts as a \"lipid sink\", sequestering the lipophilic bupivacaine, thus reducing its concentration in tissues and mitigating toxicity. Bupivacaine is a long-acting local anesthetic. Toxicity often results from overdose or accidental intravascular injection, leading to serious and potentially life-threatening complications. Mechanism of Toxicity Lipophilic nature leads to slow dissociation/prolonged blocking from cardiac sodium channels. Persistent channel blockage causes cumulative cardiotoxicity. Symptoms CNS: Tinnitus, metallic taste, dizziness, seizures. Cardiovascular: Bradycardia, dysrhythmias, asystole. Treatment 20% lipid emulsion therapy acts as a \"lipid sink\" to reduce tissue concentration of bupivacaine. Effective airway management is vital, especially in the presence of acidosis, hypercarbia, or hypoxemia. Exacerbating Factors Acidosis, hypercarbia, hypoxemia can worsen cardiac toxicity. Intravenous atropine (Option A) and Intravenous epinephrine (Option B) may be used for bradycardia and cardiac arrest, but they are not the primary treatment for bupivacaine toxicity. Intravenous sodium bicarbonate (Option D) can be helpful in managing acidosis, which may exacerbate toxicity, but it is not the primary antidote.

Dibucaine test to diagnose pseudocholinesterase deficiency: A laboratory analysis for pseudocholinesterase deficiency involves taking a plasma sample from the patient and subjecting it to a qualitative test to assess the activity of the pseudocholinesterase enzyme. Dibucaine is a long-acting & highly potent local anesthetic that inhibits about 80% of pseudocholinesterase (PChE) activity in normal individuals. In heterozygotes (with 1 variant allele), PChE activity is inhibited by approximately 40-60%. In homozygotes (with 2 variant alleles), PChE activity is inhibited by around 20%. The percentage of inhibition is known as the dibucaine number. A lower dibucaine number indicates a longer duration of residual neuromuscular blockade after administration of succinylcholine (SCh) or mivacurium.

        "D": "Fentanyl"
      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Correct answer: B) Propofol Explanation: The patient's presentation is indicative of Propofol Infusion Syndrome (PRIS) , which can occur with prolonged propofol sedation. PRIS is characterized by symptoms such as refractory bradycardia, hyperlipidemia, renal failure, and metabolic acidosis. PRIS typically occurs when a dose of >4 mg/kg/hr of propofol is given for >48 hours. Additional features of PRIS include: Hyperlipidemia (first sign to get detected) Refractory bradycardia and asystole Acute renal failure Rhabdomyolysis Severe metabolic acidosis Green-coloured urine can also be seen. Recognizing these signs is crucial for diagnosing and managing PRIS, as this is potentially fatal. Midazolam (Option A): While midazolam can cause prolonged sedation and respiratory depression, it is not typically associated with hyperlipidemia, metabolic acidosis, or renal failure. Dexmedetomidine (Option B): It can cause bradycardia, but it does not cause hyperlipidemia, metabolic acidosis, or renal failure. Fentanyl (Option D): It can cause respiratory depression and hypotension but is not associated with hyperlipidemia, metabolic acidosis, or renal failure.

      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Correct answer: C) Vitamin B 12 Deficiency Explanation: Recreational abuse of nitrous oxide can lead to vitamin B12 deficiency, causing: Peripheral neuropathy Myelopathy Cognitive impairment Malignant Hyperthermia (Option A): It is a rare but life-threatening complication typically associated with volatile anaesthetics such as halothane and depolarising muscle relaxants like succinylcholine, not with nitrous oxide. Hepatotoxicity (Option B): It is a significant side effect of halothane and is not seen as associated with nitrous oxide. The mechanism of halothane hepatotoxicity is by metabolic pathway and immune-mediated pathway. Metabolic pathway: Halothane is metabolized primarily in the liver by the cytochrome P450 enzyme system, into trifluoroacetic acid (TFA) producing reactive intermediates, such as trifluoroacetyl chloride, which can bind to hepatic proteins, forming neoantigens. Immune-Mediated Response: The neoantigens formed by the binding of reactive intermediates to liver proteins can trigger an immune response. In susceptible individuals, this can lead to hepatic inflammation and injury known as halothane hepatitis. Renal toxicity (Option D): It is seen with anaesthetics such as methoxyflurane and halothane and not with nitrous oxide.",

      },
      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Correct answer: C) a-2, b-3, c-4, d-1 Explanation: The blood/gas partition coefficient is a measure of how soluble gas is in the blood. Lower values indicate faster induction and recovery times and helps minimize respiratory depression. Desflurane has the lowest B/G coefficient (0.42). It is the fastest-acting flurane. For a patient with COPD, minimizing time spent under deep anesthesia is crucial, hence desflurane is preferred for rapid onset and offset of anesthesia. Sevoflurane: B/G partition coefficient is 0.68. Isoflurane: B/G partition coefficient is 1.4. Nitrous Oxide: B/G partition coefficient is 0.47.

      "question": "A 25-year-old male presents to the emergency department with acute onset right lower quadrant abdominal pain, nausea, and vomiting. On examination, he has right lower quadrant rebound tenderness and guarding. The doctor decides to take him up for an emergency surgery. Which inhalation anaesthetic would be best for induction in this patient based on its MAC values and blood gas solubility?",
      "options": {
        "A": "Nitrous oxide",
        "B": "Sevoflurane",
        "C": "Desflurane",
        "D": "Halothane"
      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Correct answer: B) Sevoflurane Explanation: Sevoflurane has a moderate MAC value (2%) and is also preferred for its additional benefit of rapid induction and recovery times due to its relatively low blood-gas solubility. The patient’s complaints and clinical features point towards the suspicion of Appendicitis. Hence, he is possibly being taken up for an emergency laparoscopic appendicectomy. COMPOUND A of sevoflurane causes renal toxicity MAC Definition: The concentration of the general anaesthetic in the alveoli of the lung that produces unresponsiveness to the surgical incision in 50% of patients. Nitrous oxide (Option A): It has a very high MAC value (105%) and is not potent enough to be used as a sole anaesthetic agent. Desflurane (Option C): It has a MAC value of around 6%, so it is less potent than sevoflurane. However, it has a very rapid onset and offset, making it suitable for short procedures and outpatient surgeries . Halothane (Option D): It has a very low MAC value (0.75%), indicating high potency, but it is associated with significant side effects, including hepatotoxicity, and is less commonly used today.",
