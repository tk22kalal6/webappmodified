      "question": "Adrenaline acting via beta 2 receptors causes bronchodilation, whereas histamine acts through H1 receptors to cause bronchoconstriction. Which type of antagonism is it?",
      "options": {
        "A": "Physiological antagonism",
        "B": "Chemical antagonism",
        "C": "Non-Competitive Antagonist",
        "D": "Competitive antagonism"
      },
      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer A - Physiological antagonism Explanation: Physiological antagonism refers to the interaction between two substances or pathways that have opposing physiological effects. In this case, adrenaline (also known as epinephrine) acting through beta 2 receptors causes bronchodilation, while histamine acting through H1 receptors causes bronchoconstriction. Type of Antagonist Description Example Physiological Antagonist Involves two agents that produce opposite effects on the same physiological function without interacting directly with each other or the same receptor. Histamine causes bronchoconstriction, while adrenaline causes bronchodilatation Chemical Antagonist (Option B) Direct interaction between two drugs to form an inactive product. Heparin works by enhancing the activity of antithrombin III, which inhibits blood clotting. Protamine sulfate binds to the negatively charged heparin, neutralizing its anticoagulant effect. Non-Competitive Antagonist (Option C) Prevents the action of an agonist without competing with it for the binding site. Irreversible binding to the receptor reduces the maximum effect of the agonist. Phenoxybenzamine binds to α -adrenergic receptors, reducing the effect of adrenaline. Competitive Antagonist (Option D) Competes with agonists for the same binding site, reducing the potency of the agonist. Reversible binding to the same receptor site as the agonist. Propranolol ( β -blocker) binds to β -adrenergic receptors, reducing the effect of adrenaline. Reference: K D Tripathi, Essentials of Medical Pharmacology, 8th Edition, Page 67",

        "D": "9.8 hours"
      },
      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer C - 13.8 hours The half-life of the given drug is 13.8 hours. Half-life is the time taken by a drug for the drug plasma concentration to decrease by 50%, and the elimination rate constant of a drug reflects the fraction of drug removed from the body per unitof time. The formula for calculating the half-life of a drug is: t1/2 = 0.693 / K Putting in the given elimination rate constant of 0.05/hr, we get: Half-life = 0.693 / 0.05 = 13.86 hours Reference: Goodman and Gilman's The Pharmacological Basis of Therapeutics, 14th Edition, Page 23-24",

      "question": "A patient on Digoxin, Potassium chloride, Clarithromycin, Atenolol and Triamterene developed atrial fibrillation with controlled ventricular rate. Investigations showed elevated Digoxin levels. Which of the following drugs is responsible for the rise in serum Digoxin?",
      "options": {
        "A": "Potassium Chloride",
        "B": "Clarithromycin",
        "C": "Atenolol",
        "D": "Rifampicin"
      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: B) Clarithromycin Explanation: Atrial fibrillation with controlled ventricular rate along with elevated digoxin levels are suggestive of digoxin toxicity, which has most likely occurred due to concurrent use of Digoxin with Clarithromycin, as clarithromycin inhibits P-glycoprotein. P-glycoprotein (P-gp), also known as ATP-binding cassette sub-family B member 1 ( ABCB1 ) or multidrug resistance protein 1 ( MDR1 ), is an efflux transporter protein. It has a major role in the elimination of Digoxin. Its primary function is to pump out drugs from inside the cell to outside the cell Location of Pgp in various body tissues: GIT: Decreases absorption of the drug. Kidney: Increases urinary excretion of the drug. Liver: Increases bile excretion of the drug. Blood-brain-barrier/Placenta: Decreases drug entry into the brain/placental cells. P-glycoprotein Inducer P-glycoprotein Inhibitor Activity Increases the activity of Pgp Decreases the activity of Pgp Drugs Rifampicin Phenobarbitone. Mnemonic: QVACKER Quinidine Verapamil Amiodarone Clarithromycin Ketoconazole Erythromycin Ritonavir Combined with Substrate of p-glycoprotein (Digoxin) Increases the activity of P-gp. Increased urinary excretion. Digoxin is excreted. Reduces the activity of P-gp. Reduced urinary excretion. Increased plasma concentration of the drug. Toxicity of digoxin: Arrhythmias. Potassium Chloride (Option A) is a supplement that is used to correct potassium deficiencies and is not known to interact with digoxin metabolism directly. Atenolol (Option C) is a beta-blocker used to treat hypertension and other cardiovascular conditions. While it can interact with digoxin, it typically reduces its effects rather than increasing its effects. Rifampicin (Option D) is an antitubercular drug that induces P-glycoprotein; thus , it increases the activity of P-gp, which results in increased excretion of Digoxin.

      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: B) Clearance of drug X desired peak plasma concentration Explanation: The formula for drug dosing rate is Clearance of drug X desired peak plasma concentration. The equation for dose rate is based on steady-state concentration. When a drug is given repeatedly at short intervals, it will accumulate in the body until the elimination of the drug matches the intake of the drug. Thus, steady-state concentration is the plasma concentration at which drug elimination = drug intake. Steady-state concentration = dosing rate/clearance Loading dose = Volume of distribution X Desired steady-state plasma concentration Maintenance dose = Target plasma concentration X Clearance X Dosing interval Bioavailability (F) Dosing rate = Clearance of drug X desired peak plasma concentration Reference: K D Tripathi, Essentials of Medical Pharmacology, 8th Edition, Page 40",

      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer C - Primidone Primidone is not a prodrug. It's an antiepileptic medication converted into active metabolites, phenobarbital , and phenylethylmalonamide (PEMA), within the body. These metabolites are responsible for its antiepileptic effects. Prodrugs offer various advantages over the active form in being more stable with better bioavailability or less side effects and toxicity.

        "D": "Rivaroxaban"
      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer B - Clarithromycin Clarithromycin is a macrolide antibiotic that can inhibit the liver enzyme CYP3A4, which is involved in the metabolism of various medications, including rosuvastatin. This inhibition can result in higher levels of rosuvastatin in the bloodstream, increasing the risk of side effects such as muscle damage (myopathy) or severe muscle breakdown (rhabdomyolysis). As a result, combining rosuvastatin with clarithromycin should be avoided unless the benefits outweigh the risks. If an antibiotic is needed, alternatives like azithromycin , which does not significantly affect CYP3A4, may be considered. Oxycodone (Option A): There is no significant interaction between rosuvastatin and oxycodone. These medications can generally be used together without the need for special precautions or dosage adjustments. Adalimumab (Option C) , used to treat inflammatory conditions such as rheumatoid arthritis and Crohn's disease, does not have a known significant interaction with rosuvastatin. These medications can be used together safely. Rivaroxaban (Option D) , an anticoagulant, does not interact significantly with rosuvastatin. These medications can be taken together without any specific concerns. Reference: K D Tripathi, Essentials of Medical Pharmacology, 8th Edition, Page 804,30",

        "C": "Same",
        "D": "4 times"
      },
      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer C - Same Normality (N) depends on the number of equivalents of reactive species in a solution. Hydrochloric acid (HCl) dissociates to produce 1 mole of H I per mole of HCl, giving it a normality equal to its molarity. Sulfuric acid (H I SO I ) dissociates to produce 2 moles of H I per mole of H I SO I , so its normality is double its molarity. However, in the case of the comparison between 2M HCl and 1M H I SO I , we need to consider the equivalents. 2M HCl : Normality = 2M × 1 = 2 N 1M H I SO I : Normality = 1M × 2 = 2 N Thus, the normality of 2M HCl is the same as that of 1M H I SO I , both being 2N .

        "D": "Both drugs do not need monitoring"
      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer B - TDM is done for gentamicin Therapeutic Drug Monitoring (TDM) is especially important for gentamicin , an aminoglycoside, because it has a narrow therapeutic index and can cause toxic effects like nephrotoxicity and ototoxicity. Monitoring blood levels ensures the drug remains within a safe and effective range. Penicillin generally does not require TDM as it has a wider therapeutic index. However, in some cases of high-dose therapy or renal impairment, monitoring may be necessary to avoid toxicity. Drugs that require Therapeutic Drug Monitoring (TDM): Drugs with erratic pharmacokinetics and low safety margins , such as digoxin, anticonvulsants, antiarrhythmics, theophylline, aminoglycoside antibiotics, lithium, and tricyclic antidepressants. Drugs with high individual variability , including antidepressants and lithium . Toxic drugs in renal failure , such as aminoglycosides and vancomycin . Cases of poisoning , where TDM is essential to assess and manage drug levels. Unexplained therapeutic failure , such as with antimicrobials . Patient compliance monitoring , particularly with psychotropic drugs . Drugs Not Requiring Therapeutic Drug Monitoring (TDM): Drugs with easily measurable responses , including antihypertensives, hypoglycemics, diuretics, oral anticoagulants, and inhalational general anesthetics.

      "explanation": "Correct Answer B - Safety Explanation: Therapeutic Index (TI) is a measure used to assess a drug's safety . It is defined as the ratio of the dose that produces toxicity to the dose that produces a therapeutic effect. TI= median toxic dose /median effective dose ; (TD50/ED50) The therapeutic window is the range of drug concentrations that can safely and effectively treat the disease. If the TI window for a drug is narrow, it requires frequent monitoring. E.g., W arfarin, T heophylline, D igoxin, L ithium ( W arning T hese D rugs are L ethal) Potency (Option B) is the amount of drug required to produce a given effect. The lower the drug dose needed, the higher the potency. The graph below helps us estimate the drugs' potency (The lower the drug dose needed, the higher the potency). The left shift of the graph indicates an increase in potency. Thus the order of potency: Drug D > B > C > A. Efficacy (Option C) is the maximal effect a drug can produce, represented by the Vmax /y-axis value. The higher the Vmax, the higher the efficacy. The graph below helps us estimate the efficacy of the drugs (the higher the Vmax, the higher the efficacy, Thus order of efficacy: Drug A > B >C >D.",

      "explanation": "Correct Answer B - Mechanism of action of a drug Explanation: Pharmacodynamics deals with the mechanism of action of a drug. The primary focus of pharmacodynamics is the study of how a drug produces its therapeutic effects at the molecular or cellular level. It refers to the specific biochemical and physiological interactions between a drug and its target molecules in the body. Incorrect Options: Mode of excretion of a drug (Option A) refers to the process by which a drug is eliminated from the body. It involves the removal of drugs or their metabolites from the bloodstream through various routes, such as renal excretion (via urine), hepatic excretion (via bile), or pulmonary excretion (via breath). This process is part of pharmacokinetics. Transport of drugs across the biological membranes (Option C) is related to pharmacokinetics, which deals with the absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion of drugs (often referred to as ADME). The latency of onset (Option D) refers to the time a drug takes to produce its pharmacological effect after administration. This is influenced by factors such as drug formulation, route, absorption rate, and distribution. While pharmacodynamics can indirectly affect the onset, the primary focus of this discipline is on the drug's mechanism of action.

      "explanation": "Correct Answer C - MDR1 Cyclosporine-induced cholestasis is due to the MDR1 receptor. P-glycoprotein (P-gp), also known as ATP-binding cassette sub-family B member 1 (ABCB1) or multidrug resistance protein 1 (MDR1) It is an efflux transporter protein. Its primary function is to pump out a wide range of substances, including drugs, from inside the cell to outside the cell (drug efflux). When Pgp is overexpressed or hyperactive in cancer cells, it leads to increased efflux of chemotherapeutic drugs out of the cells (leads to drug resistance). Location of Pgp in various body tissues: GIT: Decreases absorption of the drug. Kidney: Increases urinary excretion of the drug. Liver: Increases bile excretion of the drug. Blood-brain-barrier/Placenta: Decreases drug entry into the brain/placental cells. Substrates: Etoposide, doxorubicin, vincristine; diltiazem, verapamil; indinavir, ritonavir; erythromycin, ketoconazole; testosterone, progesterone; cyclosporine (Option C) , tacrolimus; digoxin, quinidine, fexofenadine, loperamide BRCA (Option A), or breast cancer susceptibility gene, mutation can lead to carcinoma of the breast, ovaries, pancreas and prostate. The target drugs which can be used are olaparib, rucaparib, talazoparib. OATP1B1 (Option B): Organic Anion Transporting Polypeptide 1B1 (OATP1B1) is a protein encoded by the SLCO1B1 gene in humans. It is a type of transporter protein found primarily in the liver and plays a crucial role in the uptake of various compounds, including drugs, bile acids, and other organic anions, into liver cells. MRP1 (Option D): Multidrug Resistance-associated Protein 1 (MRP1), also known as ABCC1 (ATP-Binding Cassette Sub-family C Member 1), is a protein that plays a significant role in cellular drug transport and the efflux of various substances from cells. Its substrates include vincristine (with GSH), methotrexate; GSH conjugate of LTC4 , ethacrynic acid; glucuronide of estradiol, bilirubin; estrone-3-sulfate; saquinavir; grepafloxacin; folate.

      },
      "correct_answer": "D",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer D - Verapamil Verapamil acts by inhibiting the ATP-binding cassette transporter. P-glycoprotein (P-gp) , also known as ATP-binding cassette sub-family B member 1 ( ABCB1 ) or multidrug resistance protein 1 ( MDR1 ), is an efflux transporter protein. Its primary function is to pump out a wide range of substances, including drugs, from inside the cell to outside the cell (drug efflux). When Pgp is overexpressed or hyperactive in cancer cells, it leads to increased efflux of chemotherapeutic drugs out of the cells (leads to drug resistance). Location of Pgp in various body tissues: GIT: Decreases absorption of the drug. Kidney: Increases urinary excretion of the drug. Liver: Increases bile excretion of the drug. Blood-brain-barrier/Placenta: Decreases drug entry into the brain/placental cells. Substrate of p-glycoprotein transporter: E.g. Digoxin. P-glycoprotein Inducer P-glycoprotein Inhibitor Activity Increases the activity of Pgp Decreases the activity of Pgp Drugs Rifampicin. Phenobarbitone. Mnemonic: QVACKER Quinidine Verapamil Amiodarone Clarithromycin Ketoconazole Erythromycin Ritonavir Combined with Substrate of p-glycoprotein (Digoxin) Increases the activity of P-gp. Increased urinary excretion. Digoxin is excreted. Reduces the activity of P-gp. Reduced urinary excretion. Increased plasma concentration of the drug. Toxicity of digoxin: Arrhythmias. Tacrolimus (Option A) is a calcineurin inhibitor that suppresses T-cell activation by inhibiting IL-2 production. It does not interact with the ATP-binding cassette transporters like P-glycoprotein. Nifedipine (Option B) is a dihydropyridine calcium channel blocker that primarily acts by inhibiting L-type calcium channels, leading to vasodilation. It has no inhibitory effect on ATP-binding cassette transporters. Diltiazem (Option C) is a non-dihydropyridine calcium channel blocker that acts on both vascular smooth muscle and the heart. Its mechanism involves calcium channel inhibition, and it does not inhibit ATP-binding cassette transporters like P-gp.

      },
      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: C) Competitive antagonist Explanation: The graph shows a parallel shift to the right, indicating that propranolol is a competitive antagonist of isoprenaline. Competitive antagonists work by reversibly binding to the same receptor as the agonist (in this case, isoprenaline ) but without activating the receptor. They compete with the agonist for binding sites. The agonist's maximum response can still be reached but at a higher dose of the agonist. In the presence of propranolol, the DRC for isoprenaline would shift to the right , indicating that higher concentrations of isoprenaline are required to achieve the same effect due to the competition for the receptor. Partial agonist (Option A) binds to the receptor and elicits a submaximal response , even when all receptors are occupied. This is not the behaviour described for propranolol, which is a beta-blocker and not a partial agonist. Agonist (Option B) activates a receptor to produce an effect similar to the physiological signal molecule. Propranolol is not an agonist because it does not activate the receptor. It is a beta-blocker and prevents isoprenaline from binding to and activating the beta receptors. Non-competitive antagonist (Option D) binds to a site on the receptor that is distinct from the agonist binding site and reduces the maximum response even if the agonist concentration is increased. In contrast, a competitive antagonist can be displaced by increasing the concentration of the agonist. Reference: K D Tripathi, Essentials of Medical Pharmacology, 8th Edition, Page 49, 68.",

      "explanation": "Correct Answer A - Vit B1 The scenario of a chronic alcoholic patient exhibiting confusion, aphasia, unstable gait, and signs of Wernicke's encephalopathy suggests vitamin B1 deficiency, which can lead to Wernicke-Korsakoff Syndrome (Cerebral Beri-Beri) . Clinical Manifestations Wernicke Encephalopathy: Symptoms: Ophthalmoplegia, nystagmus, cerebellar ataxia, global confusion. Korsakoff Psychosis: Symptoms: Anterograde and retrograde amnesia, sensory agnosia, and confabulation. Causes of Thiamine Deficiency in Alcoholics Increased thiamine requirements due to alcohol consumption. Alcohol is a source of empty calories. Inhibition of intestinal thiamine absorption by alcohol. Metabolic Implications Impaired conversion of pyruvate to acetyl-CoA. Accumulation of pyruvate and lactate in the blood. Potential for life-threatening lactic acidosis. Vit C (Option B) is also known as ascorbic acid. Its deficiency results in scurvy, bleeding gums, impaired healing, bone weakness and anaemia. Vit D (Option C) is essential for calcium homeostasis and bone health; its deficiency leads to rickets in children and osteomalacia in adults. Vit B3 (Option D) is also known as niacin. Its deficiency causes pellagra, characterised by the \"4 D's\": dermatitis, dementia, diarrhoea, and can be fatal (Death). Reference: Harper’s Illustrated Biochemistry, 32nd Edition, Page 542.

        "D": "70% of the drug undergoes 1 st pass metabolism in the liver"
      },
      "correct_answer": "D",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: D) 70% of the drug undergoes 1 st pass metabolism in the liver Explanation: Bioavailability is the fraction of an orally administered drug that reaches the systemic circulation in its unchanged form. 30% bioavailability means that only 30% of the drug reaches the bloodstream unmetabolized . (Option A ruled out) The remaining 70% of the drug is either metabolized by the liver (during the first pass through the liver) or is otherwise eliminated before it can reach the systemic circulation. When a drug is taken orally, it first passes through the liver via the portal circulation, where it is partially metabolized before entering the systemic circulation. This is known as the first-pass metabolism. 30% of the drug is pure (Option B) : This is incorrect because Bioavailability refers to the portion of the drug that reaches the bloodstream in unchanged form, not the \"purity\" of the drug. 70% of drug is potent in giving therapeutic effect (Option C) : This statement misinterprets bioavailability. Potency refers to the drug's ability to produce a therapeutic effect at a given dose, not the percentage that reaches systemic circulation.

The formula for loading dose is: This equation shows that the loading dose is directly proportional to the volume of distribution. Incorrect Options: Option A - Clearance: Clearance is related to the maintenance dose rather than the loading dose. It represents the rate at which the drug is removed from the body and is important for determining the dosing rate needed to maintain a steady-state concentration, not for calculating the loading dose. Option B - Route of administration: The route of administration can affect the bioavailability of a drug, but it does not directly determine the loading dose. The loading dose is based on the volume of distribution and desired plasma concentration, though the bioavailability factor must be considered if the drug is not administered intravenously. Option D - Bioavailability: Bioavailability (F) does play a role in the calculation of the loading dose, particularly for non-intravenous routes where F is less than 1. However, the loading dose is fundamentally based on the volume of distribution, with bioavailability adjusting the dose for non-IV routes.",

Ivabradine (Option B) is an If-channel inhibitor used mainly for heart rate control in conditions like chronic heart failure or angina, but it's not effective for managing blood pressure or respiratory distress. Furosemide (Option D) is a loop diuretic that helps reduce fluid volume and can lower blood pressure.

Albumin binds to acidic drugs such as Aspirin and Phenytoin (Option A) Alpha-1 acid glycoprotein binds to basic drugs such as lignocaine, quinidine and propranolol (Option D). Binding to plasma protein affects the distribution of the drug in the body. Drugs bound to plasma protein are kept in the bloodstream and cannot cross membranes. Unbound drugs can exit the bloodstream and enter target organs where they provide therapeutic effects, get metabolised and excreted. Several drugs can displace other drugs bound to plasma protein, leading to increased pharmacological effects from the displaced drugs. Globulin (Option B) are of three types - alpha, beta and gamma, and they can bind sex hormones and steroids. Lipoprotein (Option C), like VLDL and LDL, can bind anticancer drugs such as 5-Fluorouracil and Doxorubicin.

      "explanation": "Correct Answer: B) Drug A reduces the first-pass metabolism of Drug B Explanation: B Based on the values given in the table and the p-value, Drug A reduces the first-pass metabolism of Drug B. The area under the plot of plasma concentration of a drug vs time is known as the area under the curve (AUC). It can be used as a measure of the bioavailability of a drug and to calculate the clearance rate from the body. The null hypothesis for the above question is that Drug A does not increase the AUC for Drug B, and for this to be tru, thee p-value should be > 0.05. For the above drugs, since the p-value is <0.01, the null hypothesis is rejected, which means that Drug A has increased the AUC for Drug B. Bioavailability of a drug: Percentage of the administered dose the that reaches its site of action. If the drug is metabolized largely in the liver and the intestine, the bioavailability is substantially reduced, and this is called first-pass metabolism However, if the intestinal absorption of the drug is increased, the bioavailability will also increase. So based on this, Drug A has either increased the intestinal absorption of Drug B, or it has reduced first-pass metabolism of Drug B.

First-order kinetics Zero-order kinetics Description A constant fraction of the drug is eliminated per unit of time. A constant amount of the drug is eliminated per unit of time. Rate of clearance Constant More at lower concentrations and less at higher concentrations. Half-life Constant Less at lower concentrations and more at higher concentrations. Rate of elimination Proportional to its plasma concentration. Independent of plasma concentration. Examples Most of the drugs. Alcohol, aspirin, theophylline, tolbutamide, and warfarin. In first-order kinetics, doubling the dose of a drug leads to a doubling of its plasma concentration. However, the drug's half-life remains unchanged. The half-life represents the time taken for the plasma concentration of the drug to decrease by half. In this scenario, the rate of elimination increases proportionally with the increased dose, balancing the elevated plasma concentration.

        "D": "120 minutes"
      },
      "correct_answer": "D",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: D) 120 minutes Explanation: In order to avoid reduced absorption of phenytoin due to its interaction with sucralfate, the two medications should be consumed at least 120 minutes apart from each other. Sucralfate produces a viscous and sticky polymer in an acidic pH of the stomach. It forms a protective layer over the ulcer craters and epithelial cells for up to 6 hours after a single dose. This can hinder the absorption of other drugs; henc,e a minimum gap of 120 minutes must be maintained between ingestion of phenytoin and sucralfate. Ulcer Protective Agents Bismuth Sucralfate Properties Water-soluble, but precipitates when pH <5 Basic aluminium salt of sulfated sucrose. Polymerises at pH <4, forming a sticky gel-like consistency. Mechanism of Action Increases production of gastric mucosal prostaglandin E, mucus, and bicarbonate. Precipitate mucus glycoproteins and coat the ulcer base. Detach and inhibit Helicobacter pylori directly. Precipitates surface proteins at the ulcer base, creating a physical barrier against acid, pepsin, and bile. Does not neutralise acid but delays gastric emptying. Potentially augments gastric mucosal prostaglandin synthesis for additional protection. Dosage and Administration 120 mg taken half an hour before the three major meals and at bedtime for 4-8 weeks 1 gram taken on an empty stomach one hour before the three major meals and at bedtime for 4-8 weeks Side Effects Diarrhoea, Headache, Dizziness, Blackening of the tongue, dentures, and stools Constipation Hypophosphatemia Dry mouth Nausea Indications gastritis and non-ulcer dyspepsia associated with H. pylori Occasionally used as part of a triple-drug regimen.

      "explanation": "Correct Answer: C) Gq Explanation: Phospholipase C (PLC ) acts via Gq -coupled receptors. When ligand-bound G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) are activated, Gq protein stimulates phospholipase C (PLC). PLC hydrolyses phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2) into inositol trisphosphate (IP3) and diacylglycerol (DAG) which act as second messengers. IP3 binds to receptors on the endoplasmic reticulum, releasing calcium ions (Ca2+) , which activate calcium-dependent enzymes and protein kinases. DAG remains in the plasma membrane, activating protein kinase C (PKC) to phosphorylate target proteins, initiating cellular responses like gene expression and cell growth G Protein Type Effector Second Messenger(s) Pathway Gs (Option A) Adenylyl cyclase Cyclic AMP (cAMP) Increases cAMP, activates protein kinase A (PKA) Gi (Option B) Adenylyl cyclase Reduces cyclic AMP (cAMP) Decreases cAMP, inhibits protein kinase A (PKA) Gq Phospholipase C (PLC) Inositol trisphosphate (IP3) and DAG IP3 releases Ca2+ from ER; DAG activates protein kinase C (PKC) Go (Option D) is involved in the inhibition of voltage-gated calcium channels and the regulation of potassium channels, but it does not activate PLC.

      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: B) Topical ocular carbonic anhydrase inhibitor Explanation: Dorzolamide is a carbonic anhydrase inhibitor, an ophthalmic medication, that is used topically (in eye drops) to treat conditions like glaucoma and ocular hypertension. Carbonic anhydrase inhibitors block the enzyme carbonic anhydrase , which is involved in the production of aqueous humor in the eye. By inhibiting this enzyme, dorzolamide reduces the amount of fluid produced, thus helping to lower intraocular pressure and preventing damage to the optic nerve in conditions like glaucoma. Topically applied sulfonamide antibacterial (Option A): Although dorzolamide is a sulfonamide, it is not used as an antibacterial agent but as a carbonic anhydrase inhibitor for the eye. Second–generation sulfonylurea (Option C) refers to a class of oral medications used to treat type 2 diabetes, which is unrelated to dorzolamide. Opioid receptor agonist (Option D): Dorzolamide does not affect opioid receptors, so this option is incorrect.

In the liver, the drug may undergo extensive metabolism by enzymes before it reaches the systemic circulation. This process is known as hepatic first-pass metabolism. Therefore, oral administration can result in significant metabolism of the drug, leading to lower bioavailability compared to other routes that bypass hepatic first-pass metabolism. Incorrect Options: Option A - Sublingual: Sublingual administration involves placing a drug under the tongue, where it is absorbed directly into the bloodstream through the sublingual mucosa. This route allows the drug to bypass the gastrointestinal tract and liver to some extent, leading to faster onset of action and higher bioavailability compared to oral administration. There can still be some metabolism of the drug by the liver during its passage through the systemic circulation but this is not termed as first pass metabolism Option C - Intravenous: Intravenous administration involves directly injecting a drug into a vein, allowing it to enter the systemic circulation immediately without passing through the gastrointestinal tract or liver. Since the drug bypasses hepatic first-pass metabolism, it reaches the systemic circulation in its active form with maximum bioavailability. IV administration provides rapid and precise drug delivery, making it suitable for drugs that require immediate effects or when precise control over drug levels is necessary. Option D - Transdermal: Transdermal administration involves applying a drug topically to the skin, from which it is absorbed into the systemic circulation.

Incorrect Options: Option A - Cimetidine: Cimetidine is an H2 receptor antagonist commonly used to reduce stomach acid production. It has the potential to interact with warfarin, leading to increased levels of warfarin in the blood and an increased risk of bleeding. Therefore, caution is advised, and close monitoring of the patient's international normalized ratio (INR) is necessary when cimetidine and warfarin are used together. Option C - Isoniazid: Isoniazid reduces metabolism of R-enantiomer of warfarin. This is by inhibition of CYP3A4. Reduced metabolism results in higher levels of warfarin and higher bleeding risk. This requires close INR monitoring if both drugs need to be given simultaneously Option D - Amiodarone: Amiodarone is an antiarrhythmic medication used to treat certain heart rhythm disorders. It can interact with warfarin and increase the risk of bleeding. Amiodarone can inhibit enzymes involved in warfarin metabolism, leading to increased levels of warfarin in the blood.

        "B": "Volume of distribution",
        "C": "Plasma half-life",
        "D": "Bioavailability"
      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "parameter that represents the apparent space in the body available to contain the drug. It is a theoretical volume that indicates how extensively a drug is distributed throughout the body relative to its concentration in the plasma. A higher volume of distribution suggests that the drug is extensively distributed in the tissues, while a lower volume of distribution indicates more confinement to the plasma. The volume of distribution influences the loading dose of a drug, as it helps determine the initial dose required to achieve a desired concentration in the body. Incorrect Options: Option A - Clearance: Clearance refers to the rate at which a drug is eliminated from the body. It is a pharmacokinetic parameter that measures how efficiently the body removes a drug from the systemic circulation. Clearance is influenced by various factors, including liver function, kidney function, and metabolic processes. A higher clearance indicates faster elimination of the drug from the body, while a lower clearance means slower elimination. Clearance plays a role in determining the dosing frequency and adjustment of a drug. Option C - Plasma half-life: The plasma half-life is the time it takes for the concentration of a drug in the plasma to decrease by half. It is a pharmacokinetic parameter that reflects the rate of elimination of the drug from the systemic circulation. The half-life is influenced by factors such as clearance, metabolism, and excretion. A longer half-life means the drug remains in the body for a longer duration, while a shorter half-life indicates faster elimination. The plasma half-life is used to determine the dosing interval for a drug, as it indicates how frequently the drug needs to be administered to maintain a therapeutic concentration. Option D - Bioavailability: Bioavailability is the fraction or percentage of an administered drug that reaches systemic circulation in an unchanged form. It represents the extent and rate at which the drug is absorbed and becomes available at the site of action. Bioavailability is influenced by various factors, including the route of administration, drug formulation, and first-pass metabolism. A high bioavailability indicates efficient absorption and availability of the drug, while a low bioavailability means that a significant portion of the drug is lost or metabolized before reaching the systemic circulation. Bioavailability affects the dose adjustment and selection of the appropriate route of administration for a drug. Reference: Prepladder Notes",
