      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Correct answer: B) Fexofenadine Explanation: Fexofenadine, a second-generation antihistamine, has minimal sedative effects due to its limited ability to cross the blood-brain barrier. Thus, it is helpful in patients performing tasks requiring alertness during the day. Sedation and drowsiness are common side effects of first-generation antihistamines, which can impair cognitive function and alertness, affecting the patient's ability to perform tasks requiring mental acuity throughout the day. Drugs that act by blocking Histamine H1 receptors: Generation Drug Side Effects Generalised Uses 1st Generation Diphenhydramine (Option A) Sedation, drowsiness, dry mouth, blurred vision Allergy symptoms, Insomnia, Motion sickness Chlorpheniramine Sedation, drowsiness, dry mouth Allergy symptoms Hydroxyzine (Option C) Anxiety, Allergy symptoms, Pruritus 2nd Generation Loratadine (Option D) Minimal sedation, dry mouth Allergy symptoms, Urticaria Cetirizine Allergy symptoms, Itchiness, Urticaria Fexofenadine (Option B) Non-sedating, minimal side effects Allergy symptoms, Chronic idiopathic urticaria Reference: Essentials of Medical Pharmacology- K.D Tripathi, 8th Edition, Page 181",

      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Correct answer: B) 1, 3 Explanation: Cimetidine , a H2 receptor antagonist, reduces gastric acid secretion , leading to decreased absorption of ketoconazole when administered concurrently. This interaction can result in decreased efficacy of ketoconazole. Cimetidine is also a potent inhibitor of cytochrome P450 enzymes , leading to decreased metabolism of several drugs and subsequent elevation of their serum levels. Theophylline, phenytoin, and warfarin are primarily metabolised by cytochrome P450 enzymes. Therefore, concurrent administration of cimetidine can lead to decreased metabolism and increased levels of these drugs, potentially causing toxicity due to elevated plasma concentrations.

      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Correct answer: C) Cimetidine Explanation: Cimetidine is an H2 receptor antagonist that reduces gastric acid secretion in conditions such as peptic ulcer disease and GERD. Notable side effects include CNS disturbances and antiandrogenic effects like gynecomastia. Cimetidine is known for its antiandrogenic effects, including gynecomastia, breast tenderness, and decreased libido, due to its ability to inhibit estradiol metabolism and displace dihydrotestosterone from its receptor. Ranitidine (Option A): It has no significant antiandrogenic effects and is generally well-tolerated, with a lower risk of CNS effects and fewer drug interactions compared to cimetidine. Famotidine (Option B): It also lacks significant antiandrogenic effects and has minimal drug interactions. It is more potent and has a longer action duration than ranitidine and cimetidine. Nizatidine (Option D): It has no significant antiandrogenic effects and minimal drug interactions, with a similar efficacy and side effect profile to ranitidine, although it is used less frequently.

      },
      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Correct answer: C) Fexofenadine is less likely to cause cardiac toxicity. Explanation: Terfenadine, a first-generation antihistamine, is associated with a risk of cardiac arrhythmias, including QT interval prolongation and torsades de pointes, due to its effects on cardiac potassium channels. In contrast, fexofenadine, the active metabolite of terfenadine, has a lower propensity for such cardiac adverse effects. Feature Terfenadine Fexofenadine Type First-generation antihistamine Second-generation antihistamine Cardiac toxicity Withdrawn due to risk of cardiac arrhythmias (e.g., Torsades de Pointes) when co-administered with CYP3A4 inhibitors. (Note: CAT drugs - Cisapride, Astemizole, and Terfenadine have been withdrawn due to cardiotoxicity). Generally considered safer with minimal risk of cardiac arrhythmias. Drug Interactions Prone to interactions with CYP3A4 inhibitors. Less prone to interactions with CYP3A4 inhibitors. CNS Penetration Penetrates blood-brain barrier. Poor penetration of the blood-brain barrier. Pharmacokinetics Metabolism leads to a longer half-life and duration of action. Minimal metabolism, shorter half-life, and shorter duration of action. Sedative Effects It may cause sedation and impair psychomotor performance. Minimal sedation or impairment of psychomotor performance.

      },
      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "Correct answer: A) Sumatriptan Explanation: Sumatriptan is a more potent and specific migraine treatment that provides superior pain relief than paracetamol. Mechanism of Action It is a selective 5-HT1B/1D receptor agonist that activates other subtypes of 5-HT1 receptors only at very high concentrations. Inhibits the release of calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) and causes cranial vasoconstriction. Administration and Efficacy It is administered at the onset of a migraine attack and is as effective and better tolerated than ergotamine. About 3/4 of patients obtain complete or significant relief within 2-3 hours. Available in various formulations such as Oral tablets, Nasal sprays, Injections and Rectal suppositories. Pharmacokinetics It is absorbed rapidly and completely after subcutaneous injection, with an oral bioavailability of only 15%. It is rapidly metabolised by MAO-A isoenzyme, and metabolites are excreted in urine, with an elimination half-life of approximately 2 hours. Side Effects Common side effects include tightness in the head and chest, feeling of heat and other paresthesias in the limbs, dizziness, and weakness. These are usually mild and short-lasting but can be dose-related. Paracetamol (Option B): It is not effective enough for treating moderate to severe migraine pain. Sumatriptan is a more potent and specific migraine treatment that provides superior pain relief compared to paracetamol. Telotristat (Option C): It is not indicated for treating acute migraine attacks. It is used to treat carcinoid syndrome diarrhoea. Morphine (Option D): It is not recommended for migraine due to its side effects and potential for abuse. Opioids like morphine are generally not considered first-line treatments for migraine.

They are more potent vasoconstrictors than triptans. Ergotamine and triptans have a synergistic effect, leading to enhanced vasoconstriction, and hence should never be combined.

      "question": "A 35-year-old woman presents with a history of recurrent headaches. She describes a severe throbbing headache on the right side of her head associated with nausea, vomiting, and sensitivity to light and sound. She has tried over-the-counter pain relievers without relief. Triptans are being considered. Which of the following is the fastest-acting oral triptan?",
      "options": {
        "A": "Sumatriptan",
        "B": "Rizatriptan",
        "C": "Almotriptan",
        "D": "Zolmitriptan"
      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: B) Rizatriptan Explanation: Rizatriptan has the fastest onset of action among oral triptans. Onset of relief begins within 30 minutes , which is quicker than other oral triptans. It is highly lipophilic , allowing faster blood-brain barrier penetration . Particularly useful for acute migraine attacks requiring rapid relief. Comparison of Triptans: Clinical and Pharmacokinetic Profile Drug Name Route of Administration Bioavailability Onset of Action (Oral) Time to Peak Effect Half-life Key Notes Rizatriptan Oral 45% ~30 minutes 1â1.5 hours 1.5 hours Fastest-acting oral triptan ; highly lipophilic Sumatriptan Oral, Nasal, Subcutaneous 15% (oral) 45â60 minutes 1.5â2 hours 2.5 hours SC form has fastest overall onset Zolmitriptan Oral, Nasal 40% ~45 minutes ~1.5 hours 2 hours Nasal form offers quicker relief Almotriptan Oral 70% 1â2 hours ~2 hours 3 hours Good tolerability; slower onset Eletriptan Oral 50% 30â60 minutes ~1.5â2 hours 4 hours Effective in moderate to severe migraine Frovatriptan Oral 25% ~2 hours 2â4 hours 26 hours Longest half-life ; used for menstrual migraine Naratriptan Oral 70% ~1â2 hours 2â3 hours 6 hours Fe Sumatriptan (Option A): Slower onset (45â60 mins) than rizatriptan; fastest only in subcutaneous form. Almotriptan (Option C): Onset is slower (~1â2 hours); well-tolerated but not fastest acting. Zolmitriptan (Option D): Moderate onset (~45 mins); nasal spray is faster but oral form is slower than rizatriptan.
