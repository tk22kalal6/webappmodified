      "correct_answer": "D",
      "explanation": "CORRECT ANSWER: D) Dobutamine EXPLANATION: Dobutamine is a sympathomimetic drug that primarily acts on β 1 adrenergic receptors, enhancing myocardial contractility and leading to increased cardiac output. It is primarily used as an inotrope to support cardiac function in heart failure rather than as a vasopressor. Vasopressors: Vasopressors Uses Selective α 1 agonist Phenylephrine DOC: Hypotension in aortic dissection surgeries To treat hypotension as a vasopressor in spinal anesthesia Mydriasis without cycloplegia Midodrine DOC: Postural hypotension α + β receptors Ephedrine Hypotension in pregnancy.

        "D": "Fenfluramine"
      },
      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: C) Samidorphan Explanation: Olanzapine is an atypical antipsychotic that can cause weight gain, partly due to its interaction with opioid receptors in the brain, leading to increased appetite and food intake. Samidorphan acts as an opioid receptor antagonist, blocking the effects of olanzapine on these receptors. By counteracting the appetite-stimulating effects of olanzapine, samidorphan can potentially mitigate or reduce the weight gain associated with olanzapine therapy. DRUG MOA STATUS Liraglutide GLP-1 receptor agonist that enhances satiety and slows gastric emptying, leading to weight loss also used to treat type 2 diabetes Approved (Newer anti-obesity drug) Samidorphan (Option C) Opioid Receptor antagonist blocks the effects of olanzapine on the receptors and hence reduce the weight gain associated with Olanzapine Approved (Newer anti-obesity drug) Setmelanotide Selective agonist (activator) of the MC4R Decreases appetite and increases the feeling of fullness (satiety) Increases energy expenditure and metabolism Promotes weight loss (Newer anti-obesity drug) Rimonabant (Option A) CB1 receptor antagonist; withdrawn due to psychiatric side effects.

      "question": "A 55-year-old male patient with a history of depression is being treated with phenelzine, a monoamine oxidase inhibitor (MAOI). He presents to the emergency department with a sudden onset of severe headache, palpitations, hypertension (blood pressure of 200/110 mmHg), and sweating. He reports consuming a large amount of aged cheese at a party earlier that evening.Which is the drug of choice for treating this patient's condition?",
      "options": {
        "A": "Phentolamine",
        "B": "Labetalol",
        "C": "Hydralazine",
        "D": "Captopril"
      },
      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "Correct answer: A) Phentolamine Explanation: The patient is experiencing a hypertensive crisis, which is a known potential adverse effect of consuming foods containing tyramine (aged cheese) while taking MAOI (phenelzine). CHEESE REACTION Cause and Mechanism The \"cheese reaction\" occurs when patients on MAOIs, such as phenelzine, consume foods high in tyramine (e.g., aged cheese). Tyramine is normally metabolized by monoamine oxidase in the gut. However, MAOIs inhibit this enzyme, leading to high levels of tyramine. Tyramine then enters the circulation and displaces norepinephrine from storage vesicles in adrenergic neurons, resulting in a sudden and excessive release of norepinephrine. This leads to severe hypertension, headache, palpitations, and other symptoms. Treatment Phentolamine, a non-specific reversible alpha-adrenergic blocker, is used to treat hypertensive emergencies caused by the cheese reaction. It counteracts the excessive effects of norepinephrine by blocking alpha-adrenergic receptors, thereby lowering blood pressure. Reference: K D Tripathi, Essentials of Medical Pharmacology, Page 155",

        "A": "Phenylephrine",
        "B": "Ritodrine",
        "C": "Isoprenaline",
        "D": "Methoxamine"
      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "CORRECT ANSWER: B) Ritodrine EXPLANATION: Beta-2 adrenergic receptors are present in the uterus and smooth muscles, which relax them upon stimulation. Ritodrine (option B) is a selective beta-2 receptor agonist; hence, it can be used in this case to prevent premature labor by relaxing the uterus. Options A, C, and D: Phenylephrine and methoxamine are alpha-adrenergic agonists and, hence, have no therapeutic benefit in premature labor. Isoprenaline is a non-specific beta-agonist, which causes side effects like tachycardia and palpitations when used as a tocolytic. It is less commonly employed now due to the availability of more selective beta-2 agonists that have fewer systemic side effects and are more effective.

As the name suggests, VMATs are transporters of monoamines, especially catecholamines (adrenaline, noradrenaline, and dopamine), within storage vesicles. They are mainly of three types - VMAT 1, VMAT 2 & VAchT. Centrally, this process mainly involves the release of dopamine, which is abnormal in movement disorders involving excessive dopaminergic activity. Peripherally, this process occurs at the synaptic terminals, which are responsible for maintaining blood pressure; hence, these drugs were once used to manage hypertension.

      "question": "A 60-year-old male patient is brought to the emergency department after a car accident. He presents with hypotension, bradycardia, and signs of shock. The medical team decides to administer norepinephrine (NE) to stabilize his blood pressure. You are an intern monitoring the patient's blood pressure and heart rate continuously. Which of the following tracings most accurately represents the effect of norepinephrine on this patient's cardiovascular system?",
      "options": {
        "A": "Increased systolic blood pressure with minimal change in diastolic blood pressure.",
        "B": "Increased systolic and diastolic blood pressure with increased heart rate.",
        "C": "Increased systolic and diastolic blood pressure with decreased heart rate.",
        "D": "Decreased systolic and diastolic blood pressure with increased heart rate."
      },
      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: C) Increased systolic and diastolic blood pressure with decreased heart rate α 1 and β 1 adrenergic receptors . α 1 receptors : NE induces vasoconstriction by binding to α 1 receptors on vascular smooth muscle, increasing systemic vascular resistance (SVR), leading to elevated diastolic and systolic blood pressure . β 1 receptors : NE also has some effect on β 1 receptors in the heart, which increases cardiac contractility and can raise systolic pressure . The rise in blood pressure due to increased SVR and enhanced myocardial contractility activates the baroreceptor reflex . This reflex leads to parasympathetic activation (via vagal stimulation) and bradycardia to counterbalance the elevated blood pressure, causing the heart rate to decrease . Mechanism of Action: Receptor Effect α 1 adrenergic receptors Vasoconstriction of arterioles and venules → increased systemic vascular resistance and diastolic blood pressure . β 1 adrenergic receptors Increased heart rate (chronotropy) and increased contractility (inotropy), contributing to increased systolic blood pressure . Baroreceptor reflex Increased blood pressure triggers baroreceptor reflex leading to vagal stimulation and reflex bradycardia to reduce heart rate. Norepinephrine effects on cardiovascular system: Parameter Effect of Norepinephrine Systolic BP Increased (due to β 1 → ↑ contractility & α 1 → ↑ afterload) Diastolic BP Increased (due to α 1 → ↑ peripheral resistance) Heart rate Decreased (reflex bradycardia via baroreceptor stimulation) Total Peripheral Resistance Increased (due to vasoconstriction) Pulse pressure May slightly increase or stay the same Increased systolic BP with minimal change in diastolic BP (Option A): Incorrect because NE increases both systolic and diastolic BP significantly through vasoconstriction. Increased systolic and diastolic BP with increased heart rate (Option B): Incorrect because the baroreceptor reflex induces bradycardia (decreased heart rate), not tachycardia. Decreased systolic and diastolic BP with increased heart rate (Option D): Incorrect because NE causes vasoconstriction, leading to increased blood pressure, not decreased.",

DOC for cardiogenic shock with hypotension. Stimulates I 1 receptors and increases the force of contraction of the heart. Stimulates I 1 receptors and causes vasoconstriction (increase in BP). It is a partial D 1 agonist. It is a rapidly acting vasodilator that should not be used for >48 hours. It can be given for control of severe hypertension (malignant hypertension with end-organ damage). Dopamine Epinephrine It acts on D 1 and D 2 receptors. It acts on both alpha and beta receptors except I 2 . Dose-dependent action . Acute decompensated heart failure with oliguria. Cardiogenic and septic shock. It acts on all receptors with a weak action on I 3 receptors. Uses: Anaphylactic shock. Brittle asthma. Cardiac arrest. Along with local anesthetics. Dopamine exhibits dose-dependent actions, its effects vary based on the concentration administered. Low Doses : At this range, dopamine primarily stimulates dopaminergic receptors . This leads to renal vasodilation, which can enhance renal blood flow and promote diuresis. It may also cause vasodilation in other vascular beds. Moderate Doses : At this dosage, dopamine starts to activate beta-1 adrenergic receptors in addition to dopaminergic receptors. This results in increased heart rate and myocardial contractility, which can improve cardiac output. High Doses : At higher doses, dopamine predominantly stimulates alpha-adrenergic receptors , leading to vasoconstriction. This can increase systemic vascular resistance and blood pressure.
