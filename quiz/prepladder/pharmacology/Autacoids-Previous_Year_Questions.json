      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer B - 5-HT agonist 5-HT agonists, such as triptans, are commonly prescribed for migraine treatment. These drugs stimulate 5-HT receptors, leading to vasoconstriction of cranial blood vessels . However, in patients with a history of angina/MI, they may also cause vasoconstriction in coronary arteries, potentially triggering chest pain or even a myocardial infarction due to reduced blood flow to the heart. Migraine Pathophysiology Migraine is characterized by a pulsating unilateral headache that comes in bouts lasting 4-48 hours and is associated with nausea, vomiting, sensitivity to light and sound, flashes of light, and vertigo. 5th cranial nerve stimulation (5-HT1F receptor) → Release of neurotransmitters like CGRP, neurokinin, Nitrous Oxide, 5-HT → Dilation of meningeal vessels causing headache Drugs used in acute migraine Triptans: Decrease the release of CGRP and cause vasoconstriction. E.g., Sumatriptan, Rizatriptan. CGRP ligand blockers: Eptinezumab, Fremanezumab CGRP receptor blockers: Rimegepant 5-HT1F agonist: Causes inhibition of neuronal firing. E.g., Lasmiditan Ergot alkaloids: Vasoconstrictor. E.g., Ergotamine D2 Blockers: Metoclopramide Opioids and NSAIDs 5-HT antagonists (Option A) block serotonin’s effects and are generally not linked to chest pain in patients with angina/MI. While they may have other side effects, they are not typically associated with chest pain in this context. Calcium Channel Blocker action (Option C) are used to treat angina and hypertension by causing vasodilation. They are not typically associated with chest pain in patients with angina/MI. Nitric oxide-mediated vasodilation (Option D) promotes blood vessel relaxation and is used in conditions like angina. It is not commonly linked to causing chest pain in patients with a history of angina/MI. Reference: K D Tripathi, Essentials of Medical Pharmacology, 8th Edition, Page 192-194",

      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer A - A, B & C : Aspirin is generally avoided in the treatment of gout because it can interfere with uric acid excretion, potentially exacerbating the condition. It competes with uric acid for renal secretion, reducing uric acid elimination and increasing the risk of accumulation. The DOC in acute attack of gout: First-line: NSAIDs ( all except aspirin and paracetamol ) E.g. Naproxen, piroxicam, diclofenac, indomethacin, or etoricoxib NSAID resistant cases: Colchicine Colchicine resistant cases: Intra-articular corticosteroids Diclofenac is an NSAID used to treat acute gout attacks. It tends to accumulate in inflamed joints, offering targeted relief from pain and inflammation. Indomethacin is another NSAID frequently used to manage gout. It works by inhibiting the production of inflammatory substances like prostaglandins, helping to alleviate pain and inflammation associated with gout.

      "explanation": "Correct Answer A - Dihydroergotamine Explanation: The patient's numbness and hand discolouration, as shown in the image, suggest treatment with dihydroergotamine for migraine. Dihydroergotamine Drug class Ergot alkaloids MOA Partial agonist activity at 5HT1B/1D receptors causes vasoconstriction, reducing migraine-associated inflammation. Uses Acute migraine attack Side effects Peripheral vasoconstriction Manifest as numbness, tingling, and discolouration of the fingers, commonly referred to as Raynaud's phenomenon. Discolouration of fingers - White → Blue → Red It can lead to gangrene of extremities and organs with end arteries. Nausea and vomiting Paradoxical headache and dizziness Flushing Nasal congestion Chest pain Muscle pain Sumatriptan (Option B) is a medication used for the treatment of acute migraine attacks. While it can cause side effects such as tingling or numbness, it is not associated with peripheral vasoconstriction and Raynaud's phenomenon, unlike Dihydroergotamine. Butorphanol (Option C) is an opioid analgesic used for the treatment of pain, including migraines. It is not typically associated with peripheral vasoconstriction and Raynaud's phenomenon.

      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer B - 5-Lipooxygenase inhibitor Explanation: Zileuton is a 5-lipoxygenase inhibitor, which is an enzyme involved in the metabolism of arachidonic acid to leukotrienes. It is primarily used to maintain asthma and is particularly effective in reducing bronchoconstriction and airway inflammation in conditions like asthma. Cyclooxygenase (COX) inhibitors (Option A), such as nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), work by inhibiting the activity of the COX enzymes involved in the production of prostaglandins and thromboxanes. Zileuton does not inhibit cyclooxygenase. 5-phosphodiesterase inhibitors (Option C) inhibit the enzyme that breaks down cyclic nucleotides like cAMP and cGMP. Drugs like sildenafil are used for erectile dysfunction and pulmonary arterial hypertension. Zileuton does not inhibit 5-phosphodiesterase. Prevention of mast cell degranulation (Option D) is seen with mast cell stabilisers, like cromolyn sodium. Mast cell degranulation refers to the release of inflammatory mediators, such as histamine and cytokines, from mast cells. Zileuton does not directly prevent mast cell degranulation.",

The maximum safe dose of hydroxychloroquine to minimise the risk of bull's-eye maculopathy is recommended to be 5 mg/kg of real body weight per day. Methotrexate (Option A) does not cause ocular toxicity but requires regular monitoring of liver function tests (LFTs), complete blood counts (CBC), and renal function. It can cause hepatotoxicity, myelosuppression, and pulmonary fibrosis. Sulfasalazine (Option C) requires regular monitoring of CBC (to detect hemolytic anaemia, leukopenia, or thrombocytopenia) and LFTs (for hepatotoxicity). Leflunomide (Option D) requires regular monitoring of LFTs because of the risk of severe hepatotoxicity. It also necessitates monitoring for hypertension and teratogenicity in women of childbearing age.",

      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "management of gout and certain types of kidney stones. Mechanism of Action Allopurinol is a xanthine oxidase inhibitor. It inhibits the enzyme xanthine oxidase, which is responsible for the conversion of hypoxanthine to xanthine and then to uric acid. By inhibiting xanthine oxidase, allopurinol reduces the production of uric acid, thereby lowering the uric acid levels in the blood and urine. Incorrect Options: Options B - Recombinant uricase: Recombinant uricase, also known as pegloticase, is a medication used for the treatment of chronic gout in adults who have not responded adequately to other therapies. Uricase catalyzes the conversion of uric acid, a byproduct of purine metabolism, into allantoin, a compound that is more soluble and can be easily eliminated by the kidneys. By converting uric acid to allantoin, pegloticase reduces the serum uric acid levels and helps dissolve urate crystals in tissues. Option C - Increase uric acid excretion: Uricosuric agents work by inhibiting the reabsorption of uric acid in the renal tubules, thereby increasing its elimination in the urine. Eg Probenecid, Benzbromarone and Lesinurad. Option D - Decrease chemotaxis : Colchicine inhibits granulocyte migration and is used in acute gout. Reference: Prepladder Notes",

      "correct_answer": "D",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: D) Acetaminophen Explanation: As this patient has recently undergone nephrectomy due to chronic kidney disease, Acetaminophen is the most appropriate postoperative analgesic. It inhibits COX-3, increases endogenous cannabinoids, and stimulates TRP-V1 receptors, resulting in analgesia and antipyretic properties. It is generally considered safe and well-tolerated in patients with chronic kidney disease. Patients with chronic kidney disease often have reduced kidney function and impaired clearance of certain medications, including NSAIDs and NSAIDs, which can cause further kidney damage and potentially worsen renal function, so their use is generally avoided in this patient population. NSAIDs cause impairment of prostaglandin-induced inhibition of chlorine reabsorption and ADH action, which results in salt and water retention. It also inhibits COX-2-derived prostaglandins, which regulate renal medullary blood flow, resulting in elevated blood pressure and increased risk of cardiac failure. However, acetaminophen is considered a safer alternative as it is primarily metabolized in the liver and excreted by the kidneys in a non-toxic form. Naproxen (Option A), Indomethacin (Option B), and Diclofenac (Option C), are NSAIDs that are not safe to be used in CKD.

      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: B) Paracetamol Explanation: NAPQI (N-acetyl-p-benzoquinone imine) is a toxic metabolite that is formed when paracetamol (also known as acetaminophen) is metabolized by the liver. Under normal circumstances, paracetamol is metabolized into non-toxic compounds that are excreted in the urine. However, when the dose of paracetamol exceeds a certain threshold, the liver's metabolic pathways become overwhelmed, and NAPQI accumulates in the liver, where it can cause hepatotoxicity. Acetaminophen nomogram is used to interpret serum acetaminophen concentrations in relation to time since ingestion in order to assess potential hepatotoxicity. Paracetamol overdose → Increased production of toxic metabolite NAPQI (catalysed by CYP2E1) → Depletes glutathione (which normally neutralises NAPQI) → Leads to NAPQI binding to liver cells, causing Zonal necrosis/ centrilobular necrosis with periportal sparing. Aspirin (Option A), Diclofenac (Option C) , and Ketorolac (Option D are not metabolized to NAPQI. Reference: Goodman and Gilman's The Pharmacological Basis of Therapeutics, 14th Edition Page 841",

However, they are generally not considered as first-line treatment for neuropathic pain syndromes like Thalamic Dejerine Syndrome. Neuropathic pain is often not primarily driven by inflammation, and NSAIDs are less effective in addressing the underlying mechanisms of neuropathic pain. Therefore, among the options provided, NSAID analgesics are the least useful in managing Thalamic Dejerine Syndrome. Incorrect Options: Option A - Pregabalin: Pregabalin is an anticonvulsant and analgesic medication commonly used to treat neuropathic pain conditions, including Thalamic Dejerine Syndrome. It acts by modulating calcium channels in the nervous system, reducing the release of neurotransmitters involved in pain signaling. Pregabalin can be effective in managing neuropathic pain, including the pain associated with thalamic lesions. Therefore, pregabalin is considered useful in Thalamic Dejerine Syndrome. Option B - Carbamazepine: Carbamazepine is an anticonvulsant medication often used to treat various types of neuropathic pain, including trigeminal neuralgia and diabetic neuropathy. It works by stabilizing sodium channels in neurons, reducing their excitability. Carbamazepine has been shown to provide pain relief in some patients with Thalamic Dejerine Syndrome, making it a useful option in managing the condition. Option C - Gabapentin: Gabapentin is another anticonvulsant medication commonly used for neuropathic pain management. It modulates calcium channels and is believed to inhibit the release of certain neurotransmitters involved in pain transmission. Similar to pregabalin, gabapentin has been found to be effective in treating neuropathic pain conditions, including Thalamic Dejerine Syndrome.

      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: B) Thromboxane Explanation: Inhibition of thromboxane by aspirin results in bleeding within the gastrointestinal tract, which leads to the presence of occult blood in the stool. Aspirin MOA Inhibits cyclooxygenase (COX) enzymes, particularly COX-1 and COX-2. COX-1 is involved in the production of prostaglandins and thromboxane. Effect on platelets Thromboxane A2 is a potent pro-inflammatory and pro-thrombotic molecule that promotes platelet aggregation and vasoconstriction. By inhibiting COX-1, aspirin reduces the production of thromboxane A2, which leads to decreased platelet aggregation and a reduced tendency for blood clot formation, which can contribute to gastrointestinal bleeding, including the presence of occult blood in the stool. Uses Analgesic: Rheumatoid arthritis Antipyretic Antiplatelet: Post Myocardial infraction and CVA Adverse effects 0.5-2 g/day - analgesic dose Nausea and vomiting Epigastric discomfort 3-5 g/day - anti-inflammatory dose Salicylism - vertigo, hyperventilation, tinnitus, reversible loss of hearing Hepatitis Hypersensitivity Reye’s syndrome : A rare condition seen when salicylates are given in children suffering from viral infections such as influenza, presenting as acute liver failure. Phospholipase A2 (Option A) plays a crucial role in the release of arachidonic acid from cell membrane phospholipids, which is a precursor for prostaglandins, thromboxanes, and leukotrienes. Aspirin does not inhibit PLA2 directly; rather, it acts downstream of this enzyme by irreversibly inhibiting cyclooxygenase (COX) enzymes that convert arachidonic acid into prostaglandins and thromboxanes. Phospholipase C (Option C) is involved in cellular signal transduction, where it cleaves phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2) into diacylglycerol (DAG) and inositol trisphosphate (IP3). These molecules act as second messengers in pathways regulating calcium signalling and protein kinase C activation. Phospholipase D (Option D) is involved in lipid signalling pathways. It hydrolyzes phosphatidylcholine to produce phosphatidic acid, a precursor for several signalling molecules.

      "correct_answer": "D",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: D) Aspirin Explanation: Urinary alkalinization is a technique used to increase the pH of urine , which can increase the excretion of weakly acidi c drugs that are cleared by the kidneys such as aspirin . Urine alkalinization involves administering bicarbonate (usually sodium bicarbonate) to make the urine more basic. This raises the pH of the urine, causing acidic drugs like aspirin to become more ionized and thus increase renal excretion. Aspirin Toxicity: Explanation Aspirin stimulates the brain's respiratory center, causing hyperventilation ( ↓ CO2 levels) and respiratory alkalosis The kidneys excrete more bicarbonate to counteract respiratory alkalosis, resulting in metabolic acidosis (Compensatory metabolic acidosis). High doses of aspirin can disrupt oxidative phosphorylation and kidney function, exacerbating metabolic acidosis Dosage and Toxicity Therapeutic Dose: 3-5 g/day can cause mild chronic toxicity (salicylism) Toxic Dose: Acute ingestion of 10-30 g in adults can be lethal, with much lower doses (4 mL of methyl salicylate) posing a significant risk in children Clinical presentation Salicylism : Headache, dizziness, tinnitus, reversible hearing and vision impairment, drowsiness, vomiting, hyperventilation, electrolyte imbalance Severe toxicity: Dehydration, high tone deafness , confusion, petechial haemorrhages, hyperpyrexia , seizures, hypoglycemia, psychosis, coma Management Treatment is supportive and includes gastric lavage, correction of metabolic acidosis, vitamin K supplements and urinary alkalinization with intravenous sodium bicarbonate to enhance salicylate excretion. In severe cases, hemodialysis may be necessary. Beta-blockers (Option A): The primary treatment for beta-blocker toxicity includes the use of atropine, glucagon, and sometimes calcium to improve heart rate and contractility. Urine alkalinization is not a recommended treatment for beta-blocker poisoning. Calcium channel blockers (Option B): CCB toxicity is typically treated with calcium (IV calcium gluconate or calcium chloride) and other interventions like glucagon and insulin therapy. Urine alkalinization is not effective for this type of toxicity. Acetaminophen (Option C): The treatment for acetaminophen toxicity involves N-acetylcysteine (NAC), which replenishes glutathione and helps in detoxifying the harmful NAPQI metabolite. Urine alkalinization is not used for acetaminophen poisoning.",

      "explanation": "Correct Answer C - Peptic ulcer perforation The patient presenting with diffuse abdominal pain, chronic NSAID usage, and rigidity on examination is highly suggestive of perforation of a peptic ulcer. The most relevant radiological finding in this context would be free air under the diaphragm, visible on an X-ray, which is a hallmark of hollow viscus perforation. Chronic NSAID use increases the risk of developing peptic ulcers, which can perforate and lead to peritonitis, presenting with abdominal rigidity and pain.

      "correct_answer": "D",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer D - Neutrophil chemotaxis prevention The clinical scenario describes a case of acute gout, characterised by acute inflammation in the big toe (podagra) and elevated serum uric acid levels. The management of acute gout involves medications that reduce inflammation rather than those targeting uric acid levels. Colchicine is the drug of choice for Acute Gout. Mechanism of Action: Colchicine prevents neutrophil chemotaxis and degranulation by disrupting microtubule polymerisation. This reduces the inflammatory response triggered by urate crystals in the joint. Drugs for acute attack of gout DOC- NSAIDS (All types) Except for aspirin and paracetamol Anti-inflammatory Colchicine (spindle poison) MOA: Microtubule inhibitor Used in acute attacks of gout and familial Mediterranean fever and is also the DOC for karyotyping Corticosteroids Intra articular injections, avoid oral route Immunosuppressive and anti-inflammatory Drugs for chronic gout Xanthine oxidase inhibitors (Option C) Drugs include Allopurinol (DOC) , Oxipurinol, Febuxostat MOA: Blocks xanthine oxidase enzyme → Inhibits the conversion of hypoxanthine to uric acid in the liver. Uric acid oxidase enzyme Drugs include Pegloticase and Rasburicase MOA: Uric acid is converted to allantoin and excreted in urine Uricosuric agents (Option B) Drugs include Probenecid, Benzbromaron, Sulfinpyrazone, Lesinurad MOA: Inhibit OATP transporter/URAT-1 in the kidney → inhibits reabsorption of uric acid → increased excretion of uric acid.

        "C": "Indomethacin",
        "D": "Paracetamol"
      },
      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer C - Indomethacin Indomethacin is a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) that is commonly used to promote the closure of a patent ductus arteriosus (PDA) , especially in premature infants. It works by inhibiting prostaglandins, which play a role in keeping the ductus arteriosus open. Ibuprofen , a nonselective COX inhibitor , is the drug of choice for closing a patent ductus arteriosus (PDA) in premature infants by inhibiting prostaglandin synthesis, primarily PGE2 (maintains ductus arteriosus patency during fetal development) through COX enzyme inhibition. Due to its lower risk of renal toxicity, it is considered a safer option than indomethacin for PDA closure in neonates. Uses of NSAIDs NSAIDs are avoided in Analgesic (in all types of pain except neuropathic pain) Antipyretic Anti-inflammatory Antiplatelet Tocolytic Closure of PDA Pregnancy (as it causes premature closure of ductus arteriosus) Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) Safest NSAID in these cases is paracetamol. Magnesium sulfate (Option A) is used to manage conditions such as preeclampsia, preterm labour, torsades de pointes, acute myocardial infarction, eclampsia, seizure control, and migraines. It does not influence the patency of the ductus arteriosus. Alprostadil (Option B) is used to treat erectile dysfunction, patent ductus arteriosus, and pulmonary arterial hypertension. It is primarily employed to maintain the patency of the ductus arteriosus, not to close it. Paracetamol (Option D) is an analgesic and antipyretic used for pain relief and reducing fever. It does not facilitate the closure of the patent ductus arteriosus, as it does not impact prostaglandin synthesis.

      "explanation": "Correct Answer D - Fexofenadine Fexofenadine is a second-generation antihistamine that is non-sedating and effective for managing allergic reactions like urticaria (hives). It does not cross the blood-brain barrier significantly, so it does not cause sedation, making it ideal for the student who needs to stay alert for the exam.

      "explanation": "Correct Answer B - Ergotism Based on the clinical features and CT angiography, which shows diffuse symmetrical luminal narrowing of the lower limb vessel, the patient most likely has ergotism. Ergotism is a condition caused by the ingestion of ergot-contaminated grains or the use of ergot-derived medications such as ergotamine. In patients who are HIV positive and are currently on ART may have Han IV protease inhibitors in their ART regimen, thus resulting in the inhibition of CYP3A4, which is also responsible for the metabolism of ergotamine.

        "C": "Uricosuric drug",
        "D": "Xanthine oxidase inhibitor"
      },
      "correct_answer": "D",
      "explanation": "should be treated with Xanthine oxidase inhibitors which are considered first-line in management of chronic gout, to prevent relapses. Gout is a type of arthritis caused by an accumulation of uric acid crystals in the joints, leading to inflammation and pain. Xanthine oxidase is an enzyme involved in the metabolism of purines, which are converted to uric acid. Xanthine oxidase inhibitors block the activity of this enzyme, resulting in reduced uric acid production and lower levels of uric acid in the blood. Allopurinol and febuxostat are two commonly used xanthine oxidase inhibitors in treating gout. These drugs are considered first-line agents for managing gout in chronic gout, because they effectively reduce serum uric acid levels and prevent gout flares. Incorrect Options: Option A - Pyrimidine antimetabolites: Pyrimidine antimetabolites are drugs that interfere with the synthesis of nucleic acids, specifically pyrimidines, and are used in cancer treatment. They have no role in the treatment of gout. Option B - Inhibitor of neutrophil recruitment: Inhibitors of neutrophil recruitment are drugs that prevent the migration of white blood cells called neutrophils to the site of inflammation. colchicine works by this mechanism of action, but it is not used in maintenance treatment of gout, instead it is used in acute gout flare. Option C - Uricosuric drug: Uricosuric drugs are a class of medications that increase the excretion of uric acid by the kidneys, resulting in lower serum uric acid levels. They are used in patients with gout who have under-excretion of uric acid as the cause of their hyperuricemia. However, they are not considered first-line agents in gout treatment and are generally used in combination with xanthine oxidase inhibitors or as an alternative in patients who cannot tolerate xanthine oxidase inhibitors.

        "D": "Inhibiting the synthesis of endothelins"
      },
      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "acid, prevents ischemic heart disease by inhibiting the synthesis of thromboxane A2 (TXA2) by platelets. TXA2 is a potent platelet aggregator and vasoconstrictor. By irreversibly inhibiting the enzyme cyclooxygenase (COX) in platelets, aspirin reduces the production of TXA2, which helps to prevent platelet aggregation and the formation of blood clots in coronary arteries. This mechanism of action makes aspirin an effective antiplatelet medication for reducing the risk of cardiovascular events, including heart attacks and strokes. Incorrect Options: Option B - Inhibiting prostacyclin synthesis: Prostacyclin, also known as prostaglandin I2 (PGI2), is a potent vasodilator and inhibitor of platelet aggregation. In contrast to inhibiting prostacyclin synthesis, aspirin actually inhibits the synthesis of thromboxane A2, which is derived from arachidonic acid by platelets and has proaggregatory effects. The inhibition of prostacyclin synthesis by aspirin is not its primary mechanism of action in preventing ischemic heart disease. Option C - Inhibiting the release of EDRF: Endothelium-derived relaxing factor (EDRF) refers to nitric oxide (NO), which is a potent vasodilator released by the endothelial cells lining blood vessels. While NO plays a crucial role in vascular health and regulation of blood flow, aspirin's mechanism of action in preventing ischemic heart disease is not directly related to inhibiting the release of EDRF. Option D - Inhibiting the synthesis of endothelins: Endothelins are vasoconstrictor peptides produced by endothelial cells. They play a role in regulating vascular tone and blood pressure. However, aspirin's mechanism of action in preventing ischemic heart disease does not involve inhibiting the synthesis of endothelins. Reference: Prepladder Notes",
