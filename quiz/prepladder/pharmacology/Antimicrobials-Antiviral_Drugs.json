      "question": "A 45-year-old male patient presents to the clinic with fatigue, jaundice, and abdominal discomfort. Laboratory tests reveal elevated liver enzymes and positive Hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg). Further evaluation shows HBsAg +ve, Anti- HBC IgG +ve, HBeAg +ve and evidence of liver inflammation on biopsy. What should be the drug of choice for the treatment of this patient?",
      "options": {
        "A": "Lamivudine",

        "C": "Tenofovir",
        "D": "Adefovir"
      },
      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: C) Tenofovir Explanation: Tenofovir is a potent antiviral agent with a high barrier to resistance, making it a preferred first-line treatment for chronic Hepatitis B. It suppresses viral replication, reduces liver inflammation, and has a favourable safety profile. TDF is widely recommended due to its efficacy and low rate of resistance. First-Line Treatments: Tenofovir Entecavir These drugs are preferred because they have a high genetic barrier to resistance, potent antiviral activity, and are generally well-tolerated. They effectively suppress the hepatitis B virus and are less likely to result in drug resistance. Second-Line Treatments: Pegylated interferon alfa-2a Lamivudine Adefovir Telbivudine Lamivudine (Option A) is used to treat Hepatitis B. Its long-term use is associated with a high rate of viral resistance. Interferon-alpha (Option B) can be used to treat chronic Hepatitis B. However, its use is limited by significant side effects and lower efficacy. It is often reserved for select cases where oral antiviral agents are contraindicated or not preferred. Adefovir (Option D) is an antiviral medication that can be used to treat chronic Hepatitis B. It is generally considered a second-line agent because it is less potent than TDF and entecavir and has a higher risk of nephrotoxicity.

Which of the following treatment measures has been shown to offer the maximum reduction in mortality for this patient?",
      "options": {
        "A": "Hydroxychloroquine",
        "B": "Convalescent Plasma",
        "C": "Dexamethasone",
        "D": "Remdesivir"
      },
      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: C) Dexamethasone Explanation: The given clinical vignette suggests severe COVID-19 and dexamethasone has been shown to reduce mortality in moderate to severe cases. Severe COVID-19 (Rx- admission in ICU/HDU): Respiratory rate >30/min. Breathlessness (+ve). SpO 2 <90% on room air. Dexamethasone (Option C) has been shown to reduce mortality in patients with severe COVID-19 who require supplemental oxygen or mechanical ventilation. This is likely due to its anti-inflammatory effects, which help reduce the cytokine storm and lung damage associated with severe COVID-19. Drugs used to treat COVID-19: Remdesevir (Option D) Inhibits RNA-dependent RNA polymerase Favipiravir Molnupiravir Causes errors in the viral RNA during replication Nirmatrelvir Protease inhibitor Bebtelovimab Monoclonal antibodies against spike protein of SARS-CoV2 Bamlanivimab Sotrovimab Tocilizumab IL-6 inhibitor Baricitinib Janus kinase inhibitor Corticosteroids Methylprednisolone/dexamethasone.

      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: C) Foscarnet Explanation: Foscarnet is an antiviral drug that does not require activation by viral thymidine kinase (as Acyclovir) and works by directly inhibiting viral DNA polymerase. This makes it effective against Acyclovir-resistant HSV infections. Drugs used in Acyclovir-resistant herpes Infection: Foscarnet Cidofovir Class Antiviral Antiviral Pharmacokinetics IV administration Renal clearance IV administration Renal clearance MOA Inhibits viral DNA polymerase directly Inhibits viral DNA polymerase Incorporates into viral DNA Uses HSV infections resistant to acyclovir CMV retinitis Acyclovir-resistant HSV infections CMV retinitis Respiratory papillomatosis Side Effects Nephrotoxicity Electrolyte imbalances Seizures Anemia Nephrotoxicity Ocular hypotony Neutropenia Valacyclovir (Option A) is a prodrug of acyclovir, and it shares the exact mechanism of action. Therefore, it would not be effective in managing acyclovir-resistant HSV infections. Famciclovir (Option C) is another antiviral medication used to treat herpesvirus infections. It is a prodrug of penciclovir and shares a similar action mechanism with acyclovir. Hence, it is generally not effective against acyclovir-resistant HSV. Oseltamivir (Option D) is an antiviral medication that treats and prevents influenza A & B. It is ineffective against herpes simplex virus.

        "A": "Inhibits neuraminidase, preventing the release of new viral particles",
        "B": "Inhibits viral RNA polymerase, preventing viral replication",
        "C": "Inhibits M2 ion channels, preventing viral uncoating",
        "D": "Inhibits viral protease, preventing viral maturation"
      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: B) Inhibits viral RNA polymerase, preventing viral replication Explanation: Baloxavir marboxil targets the influenza virus cap-dependent endonuclease , a component of the PA subunit of the viral RNA polymerase complex. This inhibits cap-snatching , a process by which the virus hijacks host mRNA caps to initiate viral mRNA synthesis. Blocking this step halts viral replication early in the life cycle. Baloxavir is effective against both Influenza A and B , and is typically used within 48 hours of symptom onset. Influenza Antiviral Agents – Mechanisms Drug Target/Mechanism Virus Baloxavir Inhibits RNA polymerase (endonuclease activity) Influenza A & B Oseltamivir/Zanamivir Inhibits neuraminidase → prevents viral release Influenza A & B Amantadine/Rimantadine Inhibits M2 ion channel → blocks uncoating Influenza A only Protease Inhibitors (e.g. Ritonavir) Inhibit viral protease → prevent maturation HIV, HCV Inhibits neuraminidase, preventing the release of new viral particles (Option A): Incorrect because this is the mechanism of neuraminidase inhibitors like oseltamivir and zanamivir , not baloxavir. Inhibits M2 ion channels, preventing viral uncoating (Option C): Incorrect because this is the mechanism of amantadine and rimantadine , which are used against influenza A only and are rarely used now due to resistance. Inhibits viral protease, preventing viral maturation (Option D): Incorrect because this mechanism applies to HIV and HCV protease inhibitors (like ritonavir or simeprevir), and has no role in influenza treatment.

      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: B) Initiate anti-tuberculosis treatment first and defer ART Explanation: Anti-tubercular therapy must be started first , and ART should be started after 2 weeks. This approach prioritises the immediate control of the TB infection while planning for the timely initiation of ART within 2-8 weeks. This balances the need to manage both conditions effectively and reduces the risk of complications such as Immune Reconstitution Inflammatory Syndrome (IRIS). Initiation of ART first or anti-tubercular drugs with ART simultaneously can potentially result in IRIS. (Options A and C) Prophylactic treatment for opportunistic infections (e.g., Pneumocystis pneumonia) is important in HIV patients, especially those with low CD4 counts. However, in the presence of active TB, initiating specific TB treatment takes precedence. (Option D) Reference: Harrison's Principles of Internal Medicine, 21st Edition, Page 1563,1564",

      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: C) Tenofovir + Lamivudine + Dolutegravir Explanation: The first-line regimen is tenofovir (TDF 300 mg) + Lamivudine (3TC 300 mg) + Dolutegravir (DTG 50 mg) regimen (TLD), which is a fixed-dose combination given in a single pill once a day (at a fixed time every day as per the patient’s convenience). This regimen provides a harmonized treatment approach for all adults, adolescents, and pregnant women with HIV-1, HIV-2, prior nevirapine exposure, and those co-infected with TB or hepatitis. It's a simple, potent, and well-tolerated option that facilitates decentralized service delivery, simplifies the supply chain, and reduces monitoring requirements. Tenofovir and lamivudine are both NRTIs. Dolutegravir is an integrase inhibitor with high efficacy, good tolerability, and a high barrier to resistance. Abacavir + Lamivudine + Dolutegravir (Option A) The regimen of choice for: Children aged 6-10 years and body weight of 20-30kg. People living with HIV <30kg. HIV patients with high serum creatinine values. Tenofovir+ Lamivudine + Efavirenz (Option B) The regimen of choice for women of childbearing age group who do not wish to take dolutegravir. Abacavir + Lamivudine + Lopinavir (Option D) The regimen of choice for children aged <6 years and body weight of <20kg. Reference: National Guidelines for HIV Care and Treatment 2021",

      "correct_answer": "D",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: D) Maraviroc Explanation: Maraviroc is a CCR5 inhibitor designed to block the CCR5 receptor on the surface of T cells. By doing so, it prevents HIV from entering these cells, thereby inhibiting the infection process. The other options listed are not CCR5 inhibitors but belong to different classes of HIV treatment. Drugs Mechanism of Action Entry Inhibitors Block the HIV virus from entering the host cell. CCR5 Inhibitor ( Maraviroc ) (Option D) Bind to the CCR5 co-receptor on the host cell membrane. Only attachment inhibitors active against both HIV 1&2 Fusion Inhibitors ( Enfuvirtide ) (Option A) Prevent the fusion of the HIV virus with the host cell membrane. Attachment Inhibitors (Fostemsavir) (Option B) Bind to the gp120 subunit of the HIV envelope, preventing attachment to the CD4 receptor. Post-Attachment Inhibitors (Ibalizumab) (Option C) Bind to CD4 receptors, preventing conformational changes needed for HIV entry.
