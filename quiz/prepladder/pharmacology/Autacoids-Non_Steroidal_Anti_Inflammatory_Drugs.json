The COX enzyme catalyzes the conversion of arachidonic acid into prostaglandin . The enzyme has 2 known isoforms, cyclooxygenase-1 ( COX-1 ) and cyclooxygenase-2 ( COX-2 ). The COX-1 enzyme regulates many cellular processes, including platelet aggregation, kidney afferent arteriole vasodilation, and gastric mucosa acid protection. The COX-2 enzyme is an inducible enzyme and increases during inflammatory processes. NSAIDs classification:",

      "question": "Which of the following statements about NSAIDs is false?",
      "options": {
        "A": "Used in IBD to control pain",
        "B": "Not used to treat neuropathic pain",

        "D": "Exerts anti-platelet action"
      },
      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "Correct answer: A) Used in IBD to control pain Explanation: NSAIDs are contraindicated in patients with IBD (ulcerative colitis or Crohn’s disease) because they can exacerbate inflammation and worsen symptoms due to their potential to disrupt the intestinal mucosal barrier , and they also reduce the acid secretion in the stomach , leading to increased risk of GI bleeding, ulcers, and perforation. COX 1 and 2 inhibition by NSAIDs decrease prostaglandin levels necessary for maintaining gastrointestinal mucosal defense. NSAIDs (Option B) are not helpful for the treatment of neuropathic pain. NSAIDs primarily target inflammation and do not effectively address the underlying mechanisms of neuropathic pain, which involve dysfunction in the nervous system. Prostaglandins (Option C) keep the ductus arteriosus open during fetal development, but in PDA, this opening remains after birth, causing abnormal blood flow. NSAIDs help close the ductus arteriosus by blocking prostaglandin production, thereby restoring normal blood flow. Aspirin (Option D) irreversibly inhibits COX activity, which in turn blocks thromboxane A2 production and inhibits platelet function. Aspirin, hence, increases bleeding time and reduces clot formation.

      },
      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Correct answer: C) Hypokalemia Explanation: The patient's increased NSAID dose and worsening edema and shortness of breath indicate fluid retention due to decreased efficacy of the loop diuretic (furosemide). NSAIDs can cause hyperkalemia by decreasing renin secretion and reducing aldosterone release, which lowers potassium excretion Combined use of NSAIDs and furosemide impairs renal function by reducing renal blood flow and prostaglandin-mediated vasodilation. This results in decreased diuretic efficacy, fluid retention, and exacerbation of heart failure symptoms Side effects of NSAIDs: System Side effects Additional information Gastrointestinal Nausea and vomiting Selective COX-2 inhibitors: Less likely to cause GI side effects GI hemorrhage, erosion, ulcers (Option A) Due to ↓ prostaglandin synthesis, leading to loss of mucosal protection Hematological Platelet dysfunction → Increased bruising and hemorrhage risk From reduced thromboxane A2 activity Renal Renal dysfunction/failure Reduction in efficacy of loop diuretics & antihypertensives Salt and water retention Hyperkalemia (Option C) Acute tubular necrosis Renal papillary necrosis Interstitial nephritis Analgesic nephropathy Analgesic nephropathy leads to renal failure with papillary necrosis and chronic interstitial nephritis, which is less common since the ban of phenacetin.

      "question": "A 40-year-old male with a family history of colorectal cancer presents for a screening colonoscopy due to his increased risk. Colonoscopy confirms the presence of multiple adenomatous polyps in the patient's colon. Which drug is prescribed as chemoprevention?",
      "options": {
        "A": "Mycophenolate mofetil",
        "B": "Aspirin",
        "C": "Methotrexate",
        "D": "All trans-retinoic acid"
      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Correct answer: B) Aspirin Explanation: Aspirin is used as chemoprophylaxis for colorectal cancer for those who are at high risk, such as in Lynch syndrome or Familial Adenomatous Polyposis by suppressing the polyp formation and providing symptomatic relief. Colonic tumors express large quantities of COX-2. Aspirin inhibits COX-2, reducing inflammation, and potentially slowing down the growth of precancerous and cancerous cells. Dose Action Low dose aspirin (40-300 mg/day) Antiplatelet action Medium dose aspirin (300-2400 mg/day) Analgesic and Antipyretic action High dose aspirin (2400-4000 mg/day) Anti-inflammatory action Uses of Aspirin: DOC for niacin-induced flushing Rheumatic fever MI/stroke Rheumatoid arthritis Osteoarthritis Kawasaki disease (Along with IVIG) Essential thrombocytopenia ACE inhibitor-induced dry cough Reduce the risk of colorectal cancer (FAP) APLA syndrome Mycophenolate mofetil (Option A): is an immunosuppressant used in cases of organ transplant to reduce risk of rejection. Methotrexate (Option C): is used in chemotherapy, immunosuppressant and disease modifying antirheumatic agent. All trans-retinoic acid (Option D): is used to treat acute promyelocytic leukemia.

        "D": "Eczema"
      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Correct answer: B) Patient age Explanation: Aspirin is contraindicated in children <16 years of age due to the risk of Reye’s syndrome , especially when given during viral infections. Reye’s syndrome is a rare but serious condition causing acute encephalopathy and hepatic dysfunction . The child has symptoms of an upper respiratory viral infection, making aspirin use particularly risky. The most appropriate antipyretic and analgesic in such children is paracetamol . Contraindications of Aspirin: Condition Why Contraindicated? NSAID allergy Cross-reactivity can cause severe allergic reactions Asthma Risk of bronchospasm due to NSAID-induced leukotriene shift Children with viral illness Risk of Reye syndrome Gout Aspirin impairs uric acid excretion, worsening gout Chronic liver disease Can worsen hepatic injury , especially in high doses Peptic ulcer/Gastritis Inhibits prostaglandins → increased GI bleed risk Bleeding disorders Inhibits platelet aggregation → ↑ risk of bleeding Cough (Option A): Incorrect – Cough is not a contraindication to aspirin use. Mother’s allergy (Option C): Incorrect – A maternal NSAID allergy is not a direct contraindication for the child unless a family tendency to NSAID hypersensitivity is confirmed in the child. Eczema (Option D): Incorrect – Eczema is not a contraindication to aspirin. Reference: Goodman and Gilman's- The Pharmacological Basis of Therapeutics, 14th Edition, Page 835, 839, 849.

        "C": "Increased renal bicarbonate production",
        "D": "Carbonic anhydrase inhibition"
      },
      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "Correct answer: A) Central respiratory stimulation and disruption of oxidative phosphorylation low HCO3 (normal: 22-26 mEq/L), despite a near-normal pH and a respiratory rate of 30/min, suggest that it's a mixed acid-base disorder, respiratory alkalosis with high anion gap metabolic acidosis. Aspirin stimulates the brain's respiratory center, causing hyperventilation ( ↓ CO2 levels) and respiratory alkalosis The kidneys excrete more bicarbonate to counteract respiratory alkalosis, resulting in metabolic acidosis (Compensatory metabolic acidosis). High doses of aspirin can disrupt oxidative phosphorylation and kidney function, exacerbating metabolic acidosis Dosage and Toxicity: Therapeutic Dose: 3-5 g/day can cause mild chronic toxicity (salicylism) Toxic Dose: Acute ingestion of 10-30 g in adults can be lethal, with much lower doses (4 mL of methyl salicylate) posing a significant risk in children Clinical presentation: Salicylism : Headache, dizziness, tinnitus, reversible hearing and vision impairment, drowsiness, vomiting, hyperventilation , electrolyte imbalance Severe toxicity : Dehydration, high tone deafness, confusion, petechial haemorrhages, hyperpyrexia, seizures, hypoglycemia, psychosis, coma Management: Treatment is supportive and includes gastric lavage, correction of metabolic acidosis, vit K supplements and urinary alkalinization with intravenous sodium bicarbonate to enhance salicylate excretion. In severe cases, hemodialysis may be necessary.",

        "A": "Indomethacin",
        "B": "Ibuprofen",
        "C": "Nimesulide",
        "D": "Mefenamic acid"
      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Correct answer: B) Ibuprofen Explanation: Ibuprofen, a nonselective COX inhibitor, is the drug of choice for closing a patent ductus arteriosus (PDA) in premature infants by inhibiting prostaglandin synthesis, primarily PGE2 (maintains ductus arteriosus patency during fetal development) through COX enzyme inhibition Due to its lower risk of renal toxicity, it is considered a safer option than indomethacin for PDA closure in neonates. Indomethacin (Option A): is the drug of choice for treating ankylosing spondylitis, acute gout, and rheumatoid arthritis. It is also used to close PDA in premature infants, but it carries a higher risk of renal toxicity. Nimesulide (Option C): is a preferential COX 2 inhibitor no longer in use as it causes Steven Johnson syndrome and is highly hepatotoxic. It is banned in India for use in children under 12 years of age. Mefenamic acid (Option D): is indicated primarily as an analgesic in muscle, joint, and soft tissue pain where strong anti-inflammatory action is not needed. It is also a drug of choice in treating dysmenorrhea. (Note: Ibuprofen is generally not recommended to be given with aspirin as both are inhibitors of COX-1, thereby reducing each other's efficacy).

        "C": "Piroxicam",
        "D": "Ketorolac"
      },
      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "Correct answer: A) Sulindac Explanation: Sulindac is a prodrug converted to an active sulfide metabolite in the body. It decreases the quantity and size of colorectal polyps, especially in individuals with familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP), reducing the risk of colorectal cancer. Sulindac is prescribed to treat various inflammatory diseases like arthritis. Diclofenac (Option B): is an NSAID used in arthritis pain and sprain. The liver metabolises diclofenac primarily via CYP2C9. It is more hepatotoxic. Piroxicam (Option C): a non-selective and reversible COX inhibitor, reduces synovial fluid prostaglandin levels and inhibits platelet aggregation. Liver metabolism involves hydroxylation and glucuronide conjugation, with elimination via urine and bile, and enterohepatic cycling prolongs its half-life to approximately 2 days. Ketorolac (Option D): a potent analgesic, is used for short-term management of acute pain ( ≤ 5 days) and as an injectable for managing pain following surgery, dental procedures.

        "D": "Rofecoxib"
      },
      "correct_answer": "D",
      "explanation": "Correct answer: D) Rofecoxib Explanation: Rofecoxib and Valdecoxib, selective COX-2 inhibitors, were withdrawn from the market due to their association with a higher risk of atherothrombotic events. COX-2 inhibitors reduce endothelial PGI2 production without affecting platelet TXA2 synthesis → Prothrombotic state → Increased cardiovascular risk. Hence, they should be reserved for high-risk peptic ulcer patients at the lowest dose and shortest duration and avoided in patients with a risk of heart disease. Aspirin and Naproxen (Options A and B): are safer for cardiovascular patients due to their antiplatelet effects. Aspirin irreversibly inhibits platelet aggregation primarily by inhibiting COX-1, which reduces the risk of cardiovascular events. Similarly, Naproxen's longer half-life and COX inhibition contribute to cardiovascular safety. Nefopam (Option C): doesn't act on the COX enzyme. It is a serotonin-norepinephrine dopamine reuptake inhibitor (SNDRI). It is used to treat migraines and post-anesthetic shivering. It is not known to cause cardiovascular events like STEMI.

      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "Correct answer: A) N-Acetyl cysteine Explanation: N-acetylcysteine (NAC) is the antidote for paracetamol overdose. Paracetamol Poisoning : Mechanism of Toxicity: Paracetamol (acetaminophen) overdose → Increased production of toxic metabolite NAPQI (catalysed by CYP2E1) → Depletes glutathione (which normally neutralises NAPQI) → Leads to NAPQI binding to liver cells, causing Zonal necrosis/ centrilobular necrosis with periportal sparing. Risk Factors: Factors Depleting GSH: Alcohol, fasting, or malnutrition. Children (due to lower glucuronidation capacity) On Isoniazid (Induces CYP2E1 enzyme) Clinical presentation: Early Stage (12–36 hours post-ingestion) Later Stage (2–4 days post-ingestion) Nausea, vomiting & abdominal pain Liver tenderness ↑ plasma transaminases No impairment of consciousness Right subcostal pain with tender hepatomegaly Jaundice Coagulopathy Renal impairment or failure Hypoglycemia Hepatic encephalopathy Rupert Matthew Nomogram: A clinical tool used to assess the risk of hepatotoxicity following an acute paracetamol (acetaminophen) overdose. Treatment: Activated charcoal (Option D) : Within 4 hrs of ingestion ( ↓ paracetamol absorption). N-acetylcysteine (NAC): Antidote for paracetamol overdose. It replenishes GSH stores and detoxifies NAPQI. Early administration of NAC (within 8-16 hrs) improves outcome. Naloxone ( Option B): is used to reverse opioid overdoses. Diazepam ( Option C): is used to treat anxiety, muscle spasms, and seizures.",
