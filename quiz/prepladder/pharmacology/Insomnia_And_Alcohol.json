      "explanation": "Correct Answer: B) Benzodiazepines have a wider therapeutic index compared to barbiturates. possess a narrow therapeutic index , meaning the difference between therapeutic and toxic doses is small, increasing the risk of overdose. Benzodiazepines demonstrate a steeper dose-response curve compared to barbiturates (Option A): Barbiturates exhibit a steeper dose-response curve, leading to a rapid progression from sedation to anesthesia and potentially fatal respiratory depression.

      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: C) Methohexital Explanation: Electroconvulsive therapy is advised for treatment-resistant psychiatric disorders (severe depression, schizophrenia, and catatonia) and is performed under general anaesthesia with methohexital as the drug of choice. It involves delivering a small electric current into the brain, creating a brief seizure to modify brain chemistry. Methohexital: Intravenous ultra-short-acting. Action: 5–7 min. Elimination: more rapid clearance than other barbiturates. Can increase ictal activity, and seizures. Uses: DOC for providing anaesthesia during Electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) to prevent seizure-induced trauma. Note- Other drug used for ECT: Succinylcholine. Incorrect options: Thiopental (Option A) is also an ultra-short-acting barbiturate, but methohexital is preferred for ECT due to its rapid clearance and ictal activity. Propofol (Option B) is a commonly used anaesthetic but is not the first choice for ECT due to its potential for prolonged recovery and hypotension. Midazolam ( Option D) is a benzodiazepine used for sedation and treatment of status epilepticus. However, it is not recommended for ECT due to its longer recovery time.

Phenobarbital is the treatment of choice for neonatal seizures due to its efficacy and proven safety profile. Phenobarbital (Phenobarbitone) Uses DOC in Neonatal seizures DOC in Neonatal jaundice: Crigler Najjar syndrome type 2 DOC in Gilbert syndrome MOA Increase GABA-A receptor Cl - channel opening duration without affecting the frequency.

Levetiracetam (Option C) can be used as an anti-seizure medication in children over one month old, but it is not the first-line treatment for neonatal seizures. Midazolam (Option D) is used to treat refractory seizures in neonates but is not recommended as a first-line epileptic treatment in neonates.

      "explanation": "Correct Answer: B) Sodium bicarbonate Explanation: The symptoms - coma, hypotension, shallow breathing, decreased reflexes , and mild pupillary dilatation - are strongly suggestive of tricyclic antidepressant (TCA) overdose , especially given the history of suicidal behavior . Sodium bicarbonate is the treatment of choice for TCA toxicity , particularly in patients with cardiovascular instability or QRS widening on ECG. It works by: Alkalinizing the serum , which reduces TCA binding to sodium channels. Increasing plasma protein binding of TCAs, thereby reducing free drug levels. Counteracting metabolic acidosis . Tricyclic Antidepressant (TCA) Overdose: Features and Management Clinical Features Management CNS depression, coma Airway protection Hypotension IV fluids, vasopressors if needed QRS widening, arrhythmias (on ECG) IV sodium bicarbonate Seizures Benzodiazepines Hemodialysis (Option A): Incorrect because TCAs are highly protein-bound and have a large volume of distribution, making dialysis ineffective. Flumazenil (Option C): Incorrect as this is used for benzodiazepine overdose , and is contraindicated in mixed overdoses or patients at risk of seizures , like TCA toxicity. Naloxone (Option D): Incorrect because opioid overdose presents with pinpoint pupils , respiratory depression, and unconsciousness. This patient has dilated pupils and hypotension, not typical of opioid overdose. Reference: Goodman and Gilman's The Pharmacological Basis of Therapeutics, 14th Edition, Page 437",

      "explanation": "Correct Answer: B) Zopiclone Explanation: Zopiclone , which belongs to a group of drugs called “atypical benzodiazepines/Z compounds” is the drug which helps in improving insomnia without any muscle relaxant effect. Atypical benzodiazepines (non-benzodiazepine hypnotics): Binding of the inhibitory neurotransmitter GABA to its receptor GABA-A is responsible for various responses like sedative-hypnotism, muscle relaxation, anxiolysis, amnesia and anticonvulsant. GABA-A receptor has two alpha subunits: Alpha-1 : Hypnotism. Alpha-2 : Muscle relaxation (seizure activities). Z compounds are hypnotics that selectively act on the alpha-1 subunit and don’t exhibit any muscle relaxation. Zolpidem. Zaleplon. Zopiclone. Eszopiclone. Clobazam (Option A) is a typical benzodiazepine that is predominantly used for seizure control, mood disorders, etc. Flurazepam (Option C) has hypnotic properties but will also cause some degree of muscle relaxation.

        "A": "Tasimelteon",

        "D": "Lorazepam"
      },
      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: A) Tasimelteon Explanation: This patient’s symptoms of insomnia and the specific mention of being blind suggest a diagnosis of non-24-hour sleep-wake disorder (Non-24) , a condition that frequently occurs in individuals who are blind. This disorder is characterized by the absence of synchronization with the natural 24-hour light-dark cycle, leading to difficulty in falling asleep and maintaining sleep. Tasimelteon is a melatonin receptor agonist that has been specifically approved for the treatment of Non-24-hour sleep-wake disorder , particularly in blind individuals. It helps to regulate the circadian rhythm and promote sleep. Non-24-hour Sleep-Wake Disorder and Tasimelteon Feature Details Non-24-hour Sleep-Wake Disorder This disorder occurs predominantly in blind individuals due to the lack of light perception, which helps to regulate the body’s natural circadian rhythm. Without light cues, the individual’s sleep-wake cycle becomes unaligned with the 24-hour day, leading to irregular sleep patterns. Symptoms Common symptoms include difficulty falling asleep , maintaining sleep , and daytime sleepiness . The symptoms worsen as the person’s sleep-wake cycle shifts, typically becoming progressively worse each day. Treatment with Tasimelteon Tasimelteon works by mimicking the action of melatonin at its receptors, specifically the MT1 and MT2 receptors , which help regulate the sleep-wake cycle. It is FDA-approved for blind patients with Non-24-hour sleep-wake disorder to improve sleep onset and maintenance. Administration and Effectiveness Tasimelteon is usually administered at bedtime and has shown effectiveness in improving both sleep onset and sleep duration in patients with Non-24. It aligns the individual’s circadian rhythm with the 24-hour day cycle. Ramelteon and Tasimelteon: Drug Mechanism Uses Half-life Metabolism Ramelteon MT1 & MT2 receptor agonist Insomnia (night shift workers, jet lag) 2 hours Metabolized by CYP1A, CYP2C, and CYP3A4 ; high first-pass metabolism Tasimelteon MT1 & MT2 receptor agonist Non-24-hour sleep-wake disorder (blind individuals), Smith-Magenis syndrome (night-time disturbances) 2 hours Metabolized by CYP1A2 and CYP3A4 Zolpidem (Option B) : Incorrect because zolpidem is a sedative-hypnotic used to treat insomnia, but it is not approved for Non-24-hour sleep-wake disorder . It helps with sleep initiation but does not address the circadian rhythm disruption in blind individuals. Etizolam (Option C) : Incorrect because etizolam is a thienodiazepine that has anxiolytic and hypnotic effects, but it is not specifically approved for the treatment of Non-24 or any sleep-wake disorder related to blindness.

      "explanation": "Correct Answer: C) Orexin receptor antagonism Explanation: Suvorexant acts by inhibiting the orexin receptors 1 & 2. Orexins are produced by neurons in the hypothalamus and play an important role in sleep regulation. These neurons are active during wakefulness and dormant during sleep. Hence, inhibiting orexins will improve insomnia. The drugs include suvorexant and lemborexant. The advantage of orexin antagonists over benzodiazepines is that they don’t cause anterograde amnesia.
