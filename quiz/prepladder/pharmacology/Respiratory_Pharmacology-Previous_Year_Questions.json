      "question": "Which of the following statements is incorrect regarding Samter's triad?",
      "options": {
        "A": "It is only triggered by aspirin.",
        "B": "Other NSAIDs with COX-1 blocking ability can also trigger symptoms.",
        "C": "It is characterized by asthma, nasal polyps, and aspirin sensitivity.",
        "D": "It involves overproduction of leukotrienes."
      },
      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "because Samter's triad, also known as aspirin-exacerbated respiratory disease (AERD), can be triggered not only by aspirin but also by other nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) that inhibit cyclooxygenase-1 (COX-1). These include ibuprofen, naproxen, and others that block COX-1. Therefore, patients with Samter's triad must avoid all COX-1 inhibiting NSAIDs, not just aspirin. Incorrect Options: Option B - Other NSAIDs with COX-1 blocking ability can also trigger symptoms (Correct Statement): This is a correct statement. In Samter's triad, the use of NSAIDs that inhibit COX-1 can trigger symptoms like asthma exacerbation, nasal congestion, and other respiratory issues due to their impact on the arachidonic acid pathway, leading to increased production of leukotrienes. Option C - It is characterized by asthma, nasal polyps, and aspirin sensitivity (Correct Statement): This is a correct statement. Samter's triad is defined by the presence of three key features: asthma, chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps, and sensitivity to aspirin or other COX-1 inhibiting NSAIDs. Option D - It involves overproduction of leukotrienes (Correct Statement): Explanation: This is a correct statement. In Samter's triad, the inhibition of COX-1 by aspirin or NSAIDs leads to the overproduction of leukotrienes, which are inflammatory mediators that contribute to the symptoms of asthma, nasal polyps, and other respiratory issues.",

      "question": "A group of people are travelling to the mountains, and a girl starts complaining of mountain sickness. What is the drug of choice?",
      "options": {
        "A": "Promethazine",
        "B": "Acetazolamide",
        "C": "Dimenhydrinate",
        "D": "Thiazide"
      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: B) Acetazolamide Explanation: The drug of choice for preventing and treating acute mountain sickness is acetazolamide . It is a carbonic anhydrase inhibitor that acts on PCT and leads to Na + /HCO 3 - excretion in urine. In Mountain sickness ( acute mountain sickness or AMS ), at high altitudes, lower oxygen levels lead to hyperventilation , which causes CO 2 washout and respiratory alkalosis (alkaline blood suppresses CNS). Symptoms include headache, nausea, dizziness, fatigue, and shortness of breath. When Acetazolamide is taken, it produces metabolic acidosis and reduces hyperventilation. Promethazine (Option A) is an antihistamine commonly used for motion sickness , nausea, and vertigo. While it can relieve nausea and dizziness associated with mountain sickness, it does not address the underlying acclimatisation issues that cause AMS. Dimenhydrinate (Option C) is another antihistamine used for motion sickness and nausea. Like promethazine, it helps with symptoms but does not prevent or treat the root cause of mountain sickness. Thiazide (Option D) diuretics are primarily used for managing hypertension and edema. They are not used for mountain sickness and have no role in altitude adaptation.

      "question": "A patient with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is already on inhaled salmeterol therapy, but they are currently experiencing no improvement and have presented to the outpatient department. Which of the following medications can be included in their treatment plan?",
      "options": {
        "A": "Theophylline",

        "D": "Ipratropium"
      },
      "correct_answer": "D",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer D - Ipratropium In this case, the patient is already on the bronchodilator Salmeterol . The next best step would be to add another bronchodilator, such as ipratropium, which is a muscarinic antagonist. Ipratropium bromide is an anticholinergic that inhibits the M3 receptors on the vagus nerve, supplying the bronchioles of the lung to cause bronchodilation. The bronchodilation effect is minimal in normal airways. The effect is more significant in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) patients. COPD patients have structurally narrowed airways. Higher airway resistance in COPD is due to the inverse relationship between airway resistance and the fourth power of the airway radius. Inhaled adrenergic beta 2 agonists and inhaled anticholinergics act on different primary sites in the respiratory system. Salbutamol primarily relaxes the smooth muscle in the bronchioles. Ipratropium mainly prevents bronchoconstriction in the larger airways. Theophylline (Option A) can improve expiratory flow rates, but it is not the most appropriate next step in this scenario. Azithromycin (Option B) , an antibiotic, may have a role in preventing exacerbations but is not a first-line choice for immediate symptom improvement. Oral glucocorticoids (Option C) : Although oral glucocorticoids may be used during severe exacerbations, they are not the next step for this patient. Inhaled corticosteroids combined with bronchodilators are typically preferred for managing stable COPD.",

      "correct_answer": "D",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer D - Hydrocortisone Hydrocortisone is a corticosteroid that works by reducing inflammation in the airways, not by directly widening the bronchial airways. Mechanism of Corticosteroids in Asthma: Reduces inflammation in the airways by inhibiting inflammatory mediators (prostaglandins, leukotrienes, cytokines). Decreases mucus production in the airways. Inhibits airway remodelling and thickening of airway walls. Enhances the effectiveness of bronchodilators. Anti-inflammatory drugs in Asthma : Salbutamol (Option A) is a short-acting beta-2 agonist that works by relaxing the smooth muscles of the bronchial airways, thereby widening them. Ipratropium (Option B) is an anticholinergic that works by blocking the action of acetylcholine on the muscarinic receptors, leading to bronchodilation. Deriphylline (Option C) is a bronchodilator that works by inhibiting phosphodiesterase and promoting bronchodilation.

        "B": "Diphenoxylate",
        "C": "Levopropoxyphene",

      },
      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer C - Levopropoxyphene Levopropoxyphene is a centrally acting opioid antitussive drug that is used to suppress the cough reflex in the brain. Dose - 50-100 mg every 4 hours. It has no analgesic property ,but it may cause sedation It has a high abuse potential thus it was withdrawn from the market in several countries. It may lead to respiratory depression and cardiac arrhythmias. Ambroxol (Option A) is a mucolytic medication that is used to treat respiratory diseases such as bronchitis, asthma, and COPD. It works by breaking down and thinning mucus in the respiratory tract, making it easier to cough up. Diphenoxylate (Option B) is used to treat diarrhoea. It works by slowing down the movement of the intestines, reducing the number of bowel movements and making the stool more solid. It is an opioid medication and can be abused, leading to addiction. It is usually combined with atropine to discourage its abuse due to its unpleasant side effects. Levorphanol ( Option D) is a potent synthetic opioid that is used to treat severe pain. It works by binding to opioid receptors in the brain and spinal cord along with inhibition of reuptake of 5HT/Norepinephrine and antagonism at the NMDA receptor, reducing the perception of pain. It has a higher potency than morphine and is used when other opioid medications are not effective or have intolerable side effects.

      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer A - Hypertonic saline: Paradoxical bronchoconstriction with ipratropium bromide is not seen with hypertonic saline; rather, it occurs with hypotonic saline nebulization. Paradoxical bronchoconstriction refers to a situation where instead of dilating the airways, the medication actually causes the airways to constrict. Adverse effects associated with the use of Ipratropium bromide , an anticholinergic medication used for the treatment of bronchospasm in conditions such as asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). It may occur due to: Hypotonic nebulizer solution Antibacterial additives - Benzalkonium chloride and ETDA (Option B and C) Prejunctional M2 receptor blockade on the cholinergic nerves present in the airway, causes increased release of acetylcholine, leading to bronchoconstriction (Option D) Not seen with Tiotropium bromide, as it is selective for M1 and M3 receptors and does not cause prejunctional M2 receptor blockade.

        "A": "Should not be used due to risk of addiction",
        "B": "Can be used as both have different mechanisms of action",

        "D": "Can be used to treat cough effectively"
      },
      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer C - Should not be used as it is irrational Codeine and dextromethorphan are both antitussives that act on the central nervous system to suppress cough. Additionally, codeine is an opioid with risks of addiction and respiratory depression, while dextromethorphan is non-addictive. Combining them is irrational as they have similar mechanisms of action, offering no added benefit. Should not be used due to risk of addiction (Option A) : Codeine, being an opioid, carries addiction potential, dextromethorphan is not addictive. Combining these drugs does not increase the risk of addiction. Can be used as both have different mechanisms of action (Option B): This option suggests the combination is beneficial because codeine and dextromethorphan have different mechanisms of action. However, both drugs act on the brain to suppress the cough reflex in a similar way, so combining them does not offer any additional therapeutic benefit. Can be used to treat cough effectively (Option D) : This option implies the combination is effective for treating cough. However, combining codeine with dextromethorphan provides no extra benefit over using dextromethorphan alone. The combination is considered irrational, and safer alternatives are available for cough treatment.

        "C": "Drug deposition in the oropharynx",
        "D": "Not portable"
      },
      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer C - Drug deposition in the oropharynx Metered dose inhalers (MDIs) are commonly used to deliver medication directly into the respiratory system to treat conditions such as asthma and COPD. However, one of the drawbacks of MDIs is that a significant portion of the medication can deposit in the oropharynx (back of the throat) instead of reaching the intended target in the lungs. This can reduce the effectiveness of the medication and may lead to inadequate symptom relief. Using a large-volume spacer will reduce the amount of drug deposited in the oropharynx, reducing the amount reaching GIT and reducing systemic side effects. A spacer reduces the velocity & size of particles entering the upper airways. Bacterial contamination (Option A) can be a concern with medical devices, but it is not the most common issue associated with metered-dose inhalers. Proper cleaning and maintenance can reduce the risk of contamination. Does not provide multiple doses (Option B): Metered-dose inhalers are designed to provide multiple doses. They contain a canister that delivers a specific number of doses, with each actuation releasing a measured amount of medication. It is important to track the number of remaining doses to ensure the inhaler isn't empty when needed. Not portable (Option D): Metered-dose inhalers are compact and portable, making them easy to carry and use in different settings. Therefore, \"not portable\" is not a valid drawback of metered-dose inhalers.",

      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: A) Adenosine antagonism Explanation: Adenosine antagonism because theophylline causes diuresis by blocking adenosine receptors in the kidney, which reduces sodium reabsorption and increases urine output. Mechanism of Action of Theophylline: PDE Inhibition: Nonselective inhibition of PDEs including PDE3 , PDE4 , and PDE5 increases intracellular cAMP and cGMP, leading to bronchodilation ; PDE3 inhibition is a main mechanism of smooth muscle relaxation. (Option B & D) Adenosine Receptor Antagonism: Blocks A1 and A2 receptors, reducing bronchoconstriction (via inhibition of histamine and leukotriene release). Also responsible for side effects like cardiac arrhythmias, seizures, and diuresis. Increased IL-10 Release: Enhances anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10, possibly via PDE inhibition. Inhibits NF- κ B Translocation: Reduces inflammatory gene expression, especially at high concentrations. Promotes Apoptosis: Induces apoptosis in eosinophils, neutrophils, and T lymphocytes through A2 receptor antagonism and PDE inhibition. Histone deacetylase (HDAC) Activation: Enhances corticosteroid response by increasing HDAC2 activity via PI3K- δ inhibition at low therapeutic concentrations. Beta 2 agonism (Option C) is not seen with theophylline, and it does not act as a beta 2 agonist.

      },
      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "known side effect of salbutamol. Salbutamol is primarily used as a bronchodilator to relieve symptoms of asthma and other respiratory conditions. It works by relaxing the smooth muscles in the airways, which helps improve breathing. While salbutamol can affect glucose metabolism, it typically does not cause significant changes in blood sugar levels. Incorrect Options: Option B - Hypokalemia: Hypokalemia refers to low levels of potassium in the blood. Salbutamol is a beta-2 adrenergic agonist, and its use can lead to an intracellular shift of potassium, potentially causing transient hypokalemia. This occurs due to the stimulation of beta-2 adrenergic receptors, which can activate the sodium-potassium pump and cause the movement of potassium into cells. However, significant hypokalemia is more commonly associated with higher doses or prolonged use of salbutamol. It can also be used to treat hyperkalemia. Option C - Tremors: Tremors, or involuntary shaking of the hands, is a known side effect of salbutamol. It is a result of the drug's stimulation of beta-2 adrenergic receptors in the muscles. While tremors can be bothersome, they are generally temporary and resolve once the drug is metabolized and cleared from the body. Option D - Tachycardia: Tachycardia, which refers to a rapid heart rate, is a common side effect of salbutamol. Salbutamol stimulates beta-2 adrenergic receptors in the heart, leading to an increased heart rate. This effect is desired in the context of bronchodilation but can be a concern in individuals with pre-existing heart conditions. It is important to monitor heart rate during salbutamol use, especially in individuals with cardiovascular issues. Reference: Prepladder Notes",
