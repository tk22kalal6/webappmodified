      "explanation": "freezer is 2-8°C. The United States Pharmacopeia recommends appropriate storage temperatures for drugs based on criteria that should not affect their efficacy. Room temperature (controlled): 20 to 25°C. Cool storage: 8 to 15°C. Refrigerator storage: 2 to 8°C. Freezer storage: -25 to -10°C. Apart from temperature regulations, other recommendations like “store in a cool, dry place or protect from light” should also be followed because those drugs can be susceptible to damage by humidity or light, respectively.

      "question": "A 68-year-old female on Digoxin presents to the emergency department with symptoms of nausea, vomiting, blurred vision, and severe bradycardia indicative of Digoxin toxicity. She was given antidote DIGIBIND. Which of the following categories does this specific antidote belong?",
      "options": {
        "A": "Counterfeit drugs",
        "B": "Essential drugs",
        "C": "Orphan drugs",
        "D": "Over-the-counter drugs"
      },
      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "vision, and severe bradycardia along with evidence of cardiac dysrhythmias suggests Digoxin toxicity. Digoxin-specific antibody fragments (Digibind or DigiFab) are the specific antidote for digoxin toxicity, which is an orphan drug. Orphan drugs: These are: Drugs or biological agents for diagnosis/treatment/prevention of a rare disease or condition. (or) A more common disease (endemic only in resource-poor countries) for which there is no reasonable expectation that the cost of developing and marketing it will be recovered from the sales of that drug. Rare disease: In India, Rare disease - the prevalence of the disease is <1 per 5 lakh population. In the USA, Rare disease - the prevalence of the disease is <1 per 2 lakh population. In India, the government gives incentives/money to pharmaceutical companies to make orphan drugs. Some examples of orphan drugs: Desferrioxamine Clofazimine Sodium stibogluconate Digibind Colchicine Sodium thiosulfate Fomepizole Eltrombopag Sodium nitrite Felbamate Fomivirsen ThioTEPA Adenosine deaminase Icatibant Succimer Azacitidine Nilotinib Rifabutin Bevacizumab Paromomycin Somatropin Bortezomib Rifaximin Liothyronine Carboprost Rituximab Miltefosine Orphan receptors : These are receptors whose natural ligands are unknown. They are discovered based on their structural similarity to known receptors. Types: GPCRs & nuclear receptors. Importance: To understand their function. Potential targets for new therapeutics, especially for diseases with Undiscovered treatment Examples: GPR40 and GPR55 were once orphan receptors, but they are now known to interact with specific ligands, revealing new physiological roles. Counterfeit drugs (Option A): Fake medications that are illegally produced and sold to represent their origin, authenticity, or effectiveness deceptively. Essential medicines (Option B): WHO defines essential medicines as “those that satisfy the priority healthcare needs of the population.” The drugs should be Available at all times. Available in all doses. Available in all formulations. Affordable and cost-effective. Over-the-counter drugs (Option D): Medications available without a prescription, intended for self-medication and usually for less serious conditions. Examples: Paracetamol, antacids, laxatives, vitamins etc. Reference: KD Tripathi, Essentials of Medical Pharmacology, 8th eEition, Page 6,7 https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2748783/",

      "question": "Which of the following is the primary aim of pharmacovigilance?",
      "options": {
        "A": "To conduct clinical trials for new drugs",
        "B": "To ensure the quality and efficacy of pharmaceutical products",
        "C": "To reduce the risk of drug-related harm to the patient",
        "D": "To control the marketing and distribution of medications"
      },
      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Pharmacovigilance plays a critical role in public health by ensuring the safety of pharmaceutical products once they are available to the public. While clinical trials provide initial safety data, pharmacovigilance ensures that adverse effects, which might only appear in larger or diverse populations, are detected and addressed after drugs are marketed. Elements of pharmacovigilance include: Component Description Adverse Drug Reactions (ADR) Monitoring and managing harmful effects caused by drugs. Post-Marketing Surveillance Continuous monitoring of drugs' safety profile after approval. Signal Detection Identifying new potential risks associated with a drug. Risk Management Strategies to minimize risks associated with the use of drugs. Regulatory Actions Involves recommendations for changing labels, withdrawal, or restricting use based on findings. To conduct clinical trials for new drugs (Option A): Incorrect because clinical trials are part of the drug development process, occurring before pharmacovigilance. They assess the safety and efficacy of a drug before it is marketed. To ensure the quality and efficacy of pharmaceutical products (Option B): Incorrect because ensuring quality and efficacy falls under regulatory oversight during drug approval and manufacturing, not pharmacovigilance. Pharmacovigilance primarily deals with the safety of drugs post-marketing. To control the marketing and distribution of medications (Option D): Incorrect because marketing and distribution control is managed by regulatory bodies (like FDA, EMA), which oversee drug approvals and market access. Pharmacovigilance focuses on monitoring drug safety after market approval. Reference: KD Tripathi, Essentials of Medical Pharmacology, 8th Edition, Page 100",

        "C": "It can induce physiological responses",
        "D": "Placebo helps in blinding"
      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Correct answer: B) It contains the active moiety Explanation: A placebo is an inert substance given in a medicine's garb. A placebo is similar to the actual drug. It does not contain any active moiety. It contains inert substances with expicients. It works by psychodynamic rather than pharmacodynamic means and often produces responses equivalent to the active drug (Option C) . Placebos are used in two situations: As a control device in clinical trials of drugs ( dummy medication & blinding ) (Options A & D) . To treat a patient who, in the physician's opinion, does not require an active drug. Placebos can induce physiological responses (e.g, releasing endorphins in the brain, causing analgesia). The administration of an active drug produces effects due to both pharmacological and psychodynamic effects; a placebo can supplement the pharmacological effects of active medicines. Examples: Lactose tablets/capsules, distilled water injection, multi-vitamin injections, and sham surgery. Reference: KD Tripathi, Essentials of Medical Pharmacology, 8th Edition, Page 77",

      "question": "A patient who was admitted with acute myocardial infarction is due for discharge. His previous medical records show a defective CYP2C19. Which of his following long-term medications should be avoided in this case?",
      "options": {

        "C": "Clopidogrel",
        "D": "Atenolol"
      },
      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "hence, people with genetic defects in this enzyme will be “poor metabolisers” of clopidogrel and hence will be ineffective. Pharmacogenetics/pharmacogenomics deals with the variation of drug response due to an individual's genetic makeup. Pharmacogenetics Pharmacogenomics The study of the genetic basis for variability in drug response. It uses genetic information to guide the choice of drug and dose individually. It deals with genetic influences on drug action as well as on drug handling of the body. It tends to identify individuals who are either more likely or less likely to respond to a drug, as well as those who require altered doses of certain drugs. In this patient's case, the defective CYP2C19 gene means they cannot properly metabolise clopidogrel. Pharmacogenomics takes this information to guide the choice and dose of drugs, ensuring that medications are tailored to the patient's genetic profile for optimal effectiveness and safety. Patients can be divided into four types based on the ability to bio-activate clopidogrel. Optimal metabolisers : The usual dose of clopidogrel can be completely effective. Intermediate metabolisers : Therapeutic effect can be achieved by increasing the dose. Poor metabolisers : Clopidogrel will almost always be ineffective. Over metabolisers : They require excessive dosing and can lead to adverse effects. Ticagrelor, Ramipril, and Atenolol are not metabolised by CYP2C19 (Options A, B, and D ruled out).
