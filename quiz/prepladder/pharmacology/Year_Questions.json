        "A": "Enoxaparin",
        "B": "Clopidogrel",
        "C": "Betrixaban",
        "D": "Warfarin"
      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: B) Enoxaparin Explanation: Enoxaparin is a low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) that inhibits clotting factors 10 and 2 (10 >> 2), which is the preferred anticoagulant during pregnancy for the treatment of DVT. LMWHs like enoxaparin do not cross the placenta , making them safe for use in pregnant women. Anticoagulants in pregnancy Gestational period Anticoagulants preferred 0-12 weeks LMW/ULMW heparin 12-36 weeks LMW/ULMW heparin As organogenesis is completed, Warfarin may be used only in cases of patients with mechanical prosthetic valves 36 weeks till delivery LMW/ULMW heparin During delivery No anticoagulant is used due to the risk of postpartum hemorrhage During lactation Warfarin is preferred over heparin Clopidogrel (Option B) is an antiplatelet agent , not an anticoagulant. It is useful in the prevention of arterial thromboembolism, but it is not typically used for the treatment of DVT in pregnancy. Betrixaban (Option C) is a direct factor Xa inhibitor . It is not used in pregnancy. Warfarin (Option D) is contraindicated in the first trimester of pregnancy as it is teratogenic , leading to Congenital warfarin syndrome.

      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "should not be administered in sickle cell patients : Pegylated-filgrastim is contraindicated in sickle cell patients. It can potentially stimulate the production of sickled red blood cells, leading to vaso-occlusive crises and worsening of sickle cell disease symptoms. Incorrect options: Option A. Duration of action is shorter than normal filgrastim: Pegylated-filgrastim has a longer duration of action compared to normal filgrastim. The addition of polyethylene glycol (PEG) to filgrastim prolongs its half-life, resulting in sustained release and a longer duration of action. Option B. Added advantage is that it can be taken orally : Pegylated-filgrastim is not available in an oral form. It is typically administered via subcutaneous injection. Option D. It is not effective in the treatment of severe neutropenia : Pegylated-filgrastim is effective in the treatment of severe neutropenia. It stimulates the production of neutrophils and helps reduce the duration and severity of neutropenia, which is a condition characterized by a low neutrophil count.",

        "D": "DMSA"
      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer B - Deferoxamine Explanation: Acute iron poisoning can occur when a person ingests a toxic amount of iron tablets or other iron-containing substances. Deferoxamine is a chelating agent that is used as the antidote for Acute iron poisoning. Mechanism: Binds iron in the body and forms a stable complex that can be excreted through urine and faeces. Deferoxamine helps to remove excess iron from the body and prevent its toxic effects. Luspatercept (Option A) is a medication used for the treatment of anemia in certain blood disorders and is not indicated for the treatment of iron poisoning. Deferiprone (Option C) is an oral chelating agent used to treat iron overload in disorders like thalassemia. However, deferoxamine is the preferred antidote for acute iron poisoning. DMSA (Dimercaptosuccinic acid) (Option D) is another chelating agent used for heavy metal poisoning, but it is not the preferred antidote for iron poisoning. It is more commonly used for lead or mercury poisoning. Reference: Goodman and Gilman's The Pharmacological Basis of Therapeutics, 14th Edition, Page 1521- 1524",

      "correct_answer": "D",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer D - Ciraparantag: Fondaparinux Ciraparantag is a reversal agent for all several anticoagulants such as direct factor Xa inhibitors (rivaroxaban, apixaban and edoxaban), dabigatran, and heparins Fondaparinux is an indirect factor Xa inhibitor that is used to prevent blood clots in patients undergoing surgery, those with acute coronary syndromes, and those at risk for deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism. Andexanet alfa (Option A and B) is a recombinant modified human factor Xa protein that acts as a decoy molecule to bind and sequester factor Xa inhibitors such as edoxaban and rivaroxaban . This effectively reverses their anticoagulant effect and restores normal blood clotting in patients who are experiencing bleeding or require urgent surgery. Idarucizumab (Option C) is a monoclonal antibody fragment that specifically binds to dabigatran , a direct thrombin inhibitor, and neutralises its anticoagulant effect. It was approved by the FDA in 2015 for the reversal of dabigatran in emergency situations such as life-threatening bleeding or the need for urgent surgery.

      },
      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer C - Promotes fibrinolysis Alteplase is a tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) that promotes fibrinolysis by converting plasminogen to plasmin, which in turn breaks down fibrin in blood clots. Fibrinolytic Drugs (Thrombolytics) Mechanism Activate plasminogen to plasmin via tissue plasminogen activator (t-PA) → digests fibrin → lyse thrombi to recanalize occluded blood vessels, primarily coronary arteries. Examples Streptokinase (not in use) Urokinase (not in use) Alteplase Reteplase Tenecteplase Uses Acute Myocardial Infarction (STEMI) The chief indication is for STEMI. Not indicated for unstable angina (UA) and low-risk NSTEMI. Alternative to emergency PCI. Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT) Pulmonary Embolism (PE) Indicated for large, life-threatening PE Peripheral Arterial Occlusion Indicated when surgical thrombectomy is not possible. Stroke (Ischemic Stroke) Alteplase is approved Contraindicated after 4.5 hours of symptom onset due to increased intracranial hemorrhage risk. Contraindications History of intracranial hemorrhage. History of ischemic stroke in the past 3 months. History of head injury in the past 3 months. Intracranial tumor/vascular abnormality/aneurysms. Active bleeding/bleeding disorders. Patients on anticoagulants. Peptic ulcer, esophageal varices. Recent wound, fracture, or tooth extraction. Major surgery within the past 3 weeks. Uncontrolled hypertension. Pregnancy. Inhibits Vitamin K-dependent factors (Option A) is characteristic of anticoagulants like warfarin, which inhibit the synthesis of clotting factors II, VII, IX, and X. Alteplase does not work by inhibiting these factors. Inhibits factor X (Option B) is the action of direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) like rivaroxaban or apixaban. Alteplase does not target Factor X; instead, it activates plasminogen to plasmin to break down fibrin. Activation of thrombin (Option D) is involved in clot formation by converting fibrinogen to fibrin. Alteplase does not activate thrombin. Instead, it promotes fibrinolysis by activating plasminogen, which cleaves fibrin and dissolves clots. Reference: KD Tripathi Essentials of pharmacology, 8th Edition, Page 673-675",

      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency is an X-linked genetic disorder that impairs red blood cell protection against oxidative stress, leading to hemolytic anemia when exposed to certain triggers like medications, foods, or infections. Primaquine generates reactive oxygen species (ROS), which normally would be neutralized by G6PD, but in G6PD deficiency, oxidative damage accumulates, leading to hemolytic anemia in these individuals. Mefloquine (Option B) is another antimalarial drug, it is generally not known to cause hemolysis in G6PD-deficient individuals. Penicillin (Option C) is an antibiotic that is not typically associated with hemolysis in G6PD-deficient individuals. Tetracycline (Option D) is an antibiotic, and there is no significant association between tetracycline use and hemolysis in G6PD-deficient individuals. It does not cause oxidative stress in red blood cells in the same way as drugs like primaquine. Reference: Harrison's principles of internal medicine, 21st Edition, Pages 782-785.

      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer B - Inhibits vitamin K dependent Clotting factors Dicumarol (also known as Bishydroxycoumarin) inhibits vitamin K-dependent clotting factors, including factors II, VII, IX, and X. It inhibits the enzyme VKOR (vitamin K epoxide reductase). It has poor gastrointestinal tolerance. It's not preferred now. Activates antithrombin III (Option A): Heparin is an indirect thrombin inhibitor that activates antithrombin III activity to inhibit thrombin indirectly. Dicumarol does not activate antithrombin III. Inhibits tissue plasminogen activator (Option C): Epsilon Amino-Caproic Acid (EACA) is an anti-fibrinolytic drug that inhibits tissue plasminogen activator and is used as an antidote for fibrinolytic. Dicumarol does not inhibit the action of the tissue plasminogen activator. Inhibitor of factor Xa (Option D): Apixaban, Rivaroxaban, Edoxaban, and Betrixaban are direct inhibitors of factor Xa. They are used in the treatment of DVT (deep vein thrombosis). Dicumarol does not directly inhibit factor Xa. Instead, it indirectly inhibits the production of factor Xa by inhibiting the production of vitamin K-dependent clotting factors.

It inhibits the formation of factor Xa and thus prevents thrombin formation. Inhibits platelet aggregation (Option B): Antiplatelet agents like aspirin and clopidogrel inhibit platelet aggregation and prevent the formation of blood clots. Inhibit clot formation (Option D): Anticoagulant drugs like heparin and warfarin inhibit the formation of blood clots by interfering with the coagulation cascade at different points.

      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer A - Oprelvekin (IL-11) Oprelvekin (IL-11) is a medication used to stimulate platelet production in patients who have undergone chemotherapy. It works by stimulating the production of megakaryocytes, which are the cells that produce platelets. It is approved for use in patients with chemotherapy-induced thrombocytopenia (CIT) , a condition characterized by a low platelet count caused by chemotherapy. Filgrastim (Option B) is a medication used to stimulate the production of white blood cells in patients undergoing chemotherapy. It works by stimulating the bone marrow to produce more white blood cells, which can help to prevent infections. While low platelet counts can be a side effect of chemotherapy, filgrastim is not indicated for treating thrombocytopenia.

        "C": "Glucagon to control bradycardia and hypoglycemia",
        "D": "Give sodium bicarbonate to alkalize urine"
      },
      "correct_answer": "D",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer D - Give sodium bicarbonate to alkalize urine The given scenario is a case of aspirin toxicity in which the primary treatment is to give sodium bicarbonate in order to alkalize the urine. It is an antiplatelet medication that irreversibly inhibits COX-1, thereby preventing platelet aggregation. Aspirin stimulates the brain's respiratory center, causing hyperventilation ( ↓ CO 2 levels) and respiratory alkalosis. The kidneys excrete more bicarbonate to counteract respiratory alkalosis, resulting in metabolic acidosis (Compensatory metabolic acidosis). High doses of aspirin can disrupt oxidative phosphorylation and kidney function, exacerbating metabolic acidosis. Dosage and Toxicity: Therapeutic Dose: 3-5 g/day can cause mild chronic toxicity (salicylism). Toxic Dose: Acute ingestion of 10-30 g in adults can be lethal, with much lower doses (4 mL of methyl salicylate) posing a significant risk in children Clinical presentation: Salicylism: Headache, dizziness, tinnitus, reversible hearing and vision impairment, drowsiness, vomiting, hyperventilation, electrolyte imbalance Severe toxicity: Dehydration, high tone deafness, confusion, petechial haemorrhages, hyperpyrexia, seizures, hypoglycemia, psychosis, coma Management: Treatment is supportive and includes gastric lavage, correction of metabolic acidosis, vitamin K supplements and urinary alkalinization with intravenous sodium bicarbonate to enhance salicylate excretion. In severe cases, hemodialysis may be necessary. N-acetyl cysteine to replenish glutathione stores (Option A) is not indicated in the management of aspirin overdose. It is used as an antidote for acetaminophen overdose, which can cause liver toxicity by depleting glutathione stores. Aspirin overdose does not cause glutathione depletion, so N-acetyl cysteine is not useful in this situation. Pralidoxime (Option B) is not indicated in the management of aspirin overdose. Pralidosime is an antidote for organophosphate poisoning, which can cause cholinergic toxicity by inhibiting acetylcholinesterase activity. Aspirin overdose does not cause cholinergic toxicity, so this option is not used here. Glucagon to control bradycardia and hypoglycemia (Option C): Glucagon is not indicated in the management of aspirin overdose. Glucagon is used as an antidote to beta-blocker toxicity",

      },
      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "Correct answer: A) Aminocaproic Acid Explanation: Aminocaproic acid is an antifibrinolytic agent that competitively inhibits plasminogen activators and, to a lesser extent, binds to plasminogen, preventing its conversion to plasmin. This stabilizes fibrin clots by reducing fibrinolysis, similar to PAI-1’s effect of inhibiting tPA/uPA to limit plasmin formation. By blocking fibrinolysis at the plasminogen activation step, aminocaproic acid complements PAI-1’s role in maintaining clot integrity, making it the drug of choice in conditions of excessive fibrinolysis (e.g., bleeding disorders like hemophilia or post-surgical bleeding). Tenecteplase (Option B) is a fibrinolytic (thrombolytic) agent that works by directly activating plasminogen to plasmin, which breaks down fibrin clots. Tenecteplase does not act on PAI-1; instead, its action would be opposed by PAI-1 because PAI-1 inhibits tissue plasminogen activator (tPA), reducing the activation of plasminogen. Streptokinase (Option C) is another fibrinolytic agent that works by forming a complex with plasminogen, leading to the formation of plasmin and subsequent breakdown of clots. Like tenecteplase, streptokinase's action is not directly on PAI-1, but rather on plasminogen, and its activity can be inhibited by PAI-1. Apixaban (Option D) is an anticoagulant that works by directly inhibiting Factor Xa, an essential enzyme in the coagulation cascade. Apixaban does not interact with the fibrinolytic system or PAI-1, and its mechanism of action is unrelated to PAI-1 or plasminogen activation. Reference: Aminocaproic Acid",

      "explanation": "are medications used to treat thrombosis in patients with heparin-induced thrombocytopenia. They are eliminated by the kidneys, with a half-life of about 2 hours after subcutaneous administration and approximately 10 minutes after intravenous infusion. Caution should be exercised when using these drugs in patients with decreased renal function, and daily monitoring of serum creatinine and aPTT levels is recommended. Incorrect Options: Option B - Enoxaparin: This is a low molecular weight heparin (LMWH). LMWH usually produces a predictable anticoagulant response, so routine monitoring is not needed. However, patients with renal impairment, obesity, pregnancy, and children may require monitoring using an anti-factor Xa assay due to potential variations in the drug's effects. Option C - Dabigatran: While dabigatran prolongs the aPTT, routine monitoring is not required due to its predictable anticoagulant response at fixed doses. Thrombin time is too sensitive for monitoring dabigatran, and a diluted thrombin time assay has been developed for quantifying plasma dabigatran concentrations, but these are not routinely used. Option D - Apixaban: This is an oral direct factor Xa inhibitor. Apixaban is given in fixed doses and does not require routine coagulation monitoring. The drugs affect the PT more than the aPTT, but the PT does not reliably measure their anticoagulant activity. Anti-factor Xa assays can measure drug levels. It's important to assess renal function at least yearly in patients taking oral factor Xa inhibitors or more frequently in patients with renal dysfunction.",

The availability of AT-III is crucial for heparin to exert its anticoagulant effect by inhibiting thrombin and other clotting factors. Incorrect Options: Option A - Thrombin: Thrombin is a key enzyme in the blood coagulation cascade that converts fibrinogen to fibrin, leading to the formation of blood clots. While heparin indirectly inhibits thrombin by enhancing the activity of antithrombin-III, the availability of thrombin itself is not mandatory for heparin's action as an anticoagulant. Option B - Plasmin: Plasmin is an enzyme responsible for fibrinolysis, which is the breakdown of blood clots. It is involved in the dissolution of fibrin clots by cleaving fibrin into smaller fragments. Heparin does not directly affect plasmin activity, so the availability of plasmin is not mandatory for heparin's anticoagulant action. Option D - Thrombomodulin: Thrombomodulin is a glycoprotein present on the surface of endothelial cells lining blood vessels. It plays a role in regulating blood coagulation by binding to thrombin and converting its activity from a procoagulant to an anticoagulant. While thrombomodulin is important for the regulation of thrombin activity, it is not directly related to heparin's anticoagulant action. Reference: Prepladder Notes",

This acidosis stimulates the respiratory center in the brain, increasing ventilation and improving oxygenation. By aiding in the adjustment to higher altitudes, acetazolamide can help reduce the symptoms of AMS, such as headache, nausea, and dizziness. Incorrect Options: Option A - Dexamethasone: Dexamethasone is a corticosteroid medication with anti-inflammatory and immunosuppressive properties.

      "explanation": "administered via the subcutaneous route. Subcutaneous administration involves injecting the medication into the fatty tissue layer just beneath the skin. This route allows for slow and sustained absorption of the medication into the bloodstream. LMWH is specifically formulated for subcutaneous use and is available in pre-filled syringes or cartridges. Incorrect Options: Option A - Intravenous (IV): LMWH is not typically administered intravenously. Regular heparin can be given intravenously. Option C - Intramuscular (IM): LMWH is not administered intramuscularly as it can cause pain, hematoma formation, and unpredictable absorption. Option D - Intradermal (ID): LMWH is not administered intradermally as it is not intended for local effects and may not be well absorbed through the skin. Reference: Prepladder Notes",
