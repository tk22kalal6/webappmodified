      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: C) Diuresis Explanation: Mu ( µ ) receptors are associated with strong analgesia, euphoria, and respiratory depression but not with diuresis. Diuresis is an action associated with kappa ( κ ) receptors. Opioid receptors: They are G i type of G-protein coupled receptors. Types: Mu ( µ ), kappa ( κ ), and delta ( δ ). Subtypes for kappa and delta receptors have been identified. Mu: µ 1 and µ 2 . Kappa: κ 1 and κ 2 . Actions of three types of opioid receptors: Mu receptors Kappa receptors Delta receptors High affinity for morphine & its congeners. High affinity for ketocyclazocine & dynorphin A. High affinity for Leu/metenkephalins.

      "question": "A 35-year-old construction worker presents to the emergency department after a crush injury to his lower leg from a collapsed beam. He is in severe pain, with swelling and deformity noted on examination. Vital signs are stable. What is the drug of choice for managing his pain?",
      "options": {
        "A": "Baclofen",
        "B": "Ibuprofen",
        "C": "Morphine",
        "D": "Ketorolac"
      },
      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: C) Morphine Explanation: Morphine is a potent opioid analgesic used for managing severe pain , including acute pain resulting from traumatic injuries like crush injuries . It works by binding to opioid receptors in the brain and spinal cord, altering pain perception. It is the drug of choice for managing severe pain in an emergency . Baclofen (Option A): It is a muscle relaxant used to treat muscle spasticity. Not typically used as primary pain management, especially for severe pain. Mechanism of action: Baclofen is an agonist for gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA)B receptors on pre and postsynaptic neurons in the central nervous system (CNS) and peripheral nervous system. Its action results in inhibition of the transmission of both mono and polysynaptic reflexes at the spinal cord, relaxing spasticity. Ibuprofen (Option B): It is a (NSAID) used to relieve pain, reduce inflammation, and lower fever. It can be effective for mild to moderate pain It does not provide sufficient relief for severe pain. Ketorolac (Option D): It is a (NSAID) with potent analgesic properties. It is often used for moderate to severe pain, but it is not as potent as opioids like morphine. Ketorolac is typically used when opioid analgesics are contraindicated or not preferred due to their side effects.

      "question": "A 58-year-old male presents to the emergency department with severe chest pain radiating to his left arm and jaw. He appears diaphoretic and anxious. On examination, his blood pressure is 160/100 mmHg, heart rate is 110 bpm, and respiratory rate is 24 breaths per minute. An ECG reveals ST-segment elevation in leads II, III, and aVF. Which of the following medications is the most appropriate initial treatment for his severe pain?",
      "options": {
        "A": "Meperidine",
        "B": "Ibuprofen",
        "C": "Nitroglycerin",
        "D": "Morphine"
      },
      "correct_answer": "D",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: D) Morphine Explanation: Morphine is the preferred choice for the management of severe pain in patients with acute myocardial infarction. It provides potent analgesia Vasodilatory effects I ↓ preload and afterload on the heart. ↓ Sympathetic activity (vagomimetic effect) I ↓ heart rate and ↓ blood pressure I ↓ O 2 demand. Additionally, It has sedative properties, which can be beneficial in calming an anxious patient experiencing severe pain and distress. Meperidine (Option A) is an opioid analgesic ,is not the preferred choice in acute myocardial infarction due to its potential to cause increased myocardial oxygen demand, tachycardia, and its short duration of action. Ibuprofen (Option B) is a (NSAID) that is not indicated for the treatment of severe acute chest pain associated with myocardial infarction. Moreover, NSAIDs can increase the risk of cardiovascular events and should be avoided in this setting. Nitroglycerin (Option C) is indicated for the relief of angina in patients with myocardial infarction, but it primarily acts as a vasodilator to reduce myocardial oxygen demand rather than directly targeting pain relief.

      "question": "All of the following are true about the pharmacokinetics of morphine except?",
      "options": {
        "A": "Morphine is primarily metabolised by the liver.",
        "B": "Morphine has a long half-life, typically around 2-4 hours.",
        "C": "Morphine undergoes extensive first-pass metabolism when administered orally.",
        "D": "Morphine is primarily eliminated unchanged through the kidneys."
      },
      "correct_answer": "D",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: D) Morphine is primarily eliminated unchanged through the kidneys. Explanation: Morphine is not primarily eliminated unchanged through the kidneys. Instead, it undergoes metabolism in the liver to form glucuronide conjugates, which are then excreted by the kidneys. The majority of morphine in the urine is in the form of morphine-3-glucuronide and morphine-6-glucuronide , not the unchanged drug. The other options are correct: Morphine is primarily metabolized by the liver (Option A) : True. Morphine is extensively metabolized in the liver by conjugation with glucuronic acid. Morphine has a long half-life, typically around 2-4 hours (Option B) : While the half-life of morphine can be around 2-4 hours, it can vary with the route of administration and patient factors. Morphine undergoes extensive first-pass metabolism when administered orally (Option C) : This is true. Oral morphine undergoes significant first-pass metabolism in the liver, reducing its bioavailability. Pharmacokinetic Aspect Explanation Metabolism Morphine is metabolized in the liver to morphine-6-glucuronide (active) and morphine-3-glucuronide (inactive). First-pass metabolism Oral morphine undergoes significant first-pass metabolism in the liver, reducing bioavailability. Half-life The half-life of morphine is about 2-4 hours intravenously but can be longer orally due to first-pass metabolism. Excretion Morphine is excreted primarily as metabolites (not unchanged) through the kidneys. The majority of the drug is excreted as morphine-3-glucuronide and morphine-6-glucuronide .

      },
      "correct_answer": "D",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: D) Noscapine Explanation: Codeine and oxycodone are opioid-based cough suppressants that have a high potential for addiction due to their narcotic properties. (Option A, B ruled out) Pholcodine , although less potent than codeine, is still an opioid derivative and carries a risk of addiction. (Option C ruled out) Noscapine is a non-narcotic cough suppressant derived from opium, but it lacks the addictive potential seen in opioid-based medications.

      "question": "A 32-year-old woman underwent an elective cesarean section at 39 weeks of gestation under spinal anaesthesia. Following the delivery and surgical procedure, she was transferred to the recovery room. Approximately 30 minutes later, she begins to experience intense shivering. Which of the following medications is most appropriate to treat this condition in this patient?",
      "options": {
        "A": "Ondansetron",
        "B": "Meperidine",
        "C": "Midazolam",
        "D": "Ketamine"
      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: B) Meperidine Explanation: Meperidine, also known as pethidine, is an opioid analgesic. Meperidine is considered the most effective drug for this specific purpose (DOC). It is thought to involve both opioid receptor activity and effects on the thermoregulatory center in the hypothalamus. Ondansetron (Option A) (antiemetic), commonly used to prevent nausea and vomiting postoperatively or during chemotherapy. It acts as a selective serotonin 5-HT3 receptor antagonist. Ondansetron may reduce post-anesthesia shivering; it is not the first-line treatment for this condition. Midazolam (Option C) is a benzodiazepine used for sedation, anxiolysis, and amnesia. It can also have muscle relaxant properties. While it may reduce shivering in some cases, it is not used due to the risk of excessive sedation and respiratory depression, especially in the immediate postoperative period. Ketamine (Option D) is a dissociative anaesthetic with analgesic properties. It can also have anti-shivering effects, likely due to its NMDA receptor antagonism and effects on central neurotransmitter systems. Because of its potent psychoactive effects and the potential for hallucinations, it is not considered better for the patient.

      "question": "A 35-year-old man presents to the clinic with complaints of muscle aches, insomnia, and intense cravings for opioids. He admits to using heroin for the past five years, often injecting multiple times a day. He has attempted to quit several times but has always relapsed due to severe withdrawal symptoms. He expresses a strong desire to stop using heroin and asks for medical help to manage his addiction. Which of the following is the most effective medication for the treatment?",
      "options": {
        "A": "Naltrexone",
        "B": "Lofexidine",
        "C": "Methadone",
        "D": "Clonidine"
      },
      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: C) Methadone Explanation: Methadone: Mechanism: It is a full opioid agonis t that works by binding to the same receptors as other opioids, providing similar effects and thereby preventing withdrawal and reducing cravings. Use: It is highly effective for detoxification and long-term maintenance therapy. Advantages: Methadone has a long half-life, which allows for once-daily dosing. Effectiveness: It is considered one of the most effective medications for opioid addiction, especially for individuals with a long history of high-dose opioid use. Naltrexone (Option A): Mechanism: It is an opioid antagonist that blocks the effects of opioids at their receptor sites. Use: It is used primarily for relapse prevention in opioid-dependent patients who have already undergone detoxification. Limitations: It is not effective for managing withdrawal symptoms and requires the patient to be opioid-free for a period before starting treatment. Lofexidine (Option B): Mechanism: It is an alpha-2 adrenergic agonist, that helps to reduce the physical symptoms of opioid withdrawal. Use: It is specifically approved for the treatment of opioid withdrawal symptoms. Limitations: While it can ease withdrawal symptoms, it does not address cravings and is not used for long-term maintenance therapy. Clonidine (Option D): Mechanism: It is an alpha-2 adrenergic agonist that helps to alleviate some of the physical symptoms of opioid withdrawal, such as anxiety, agitation, and muscle aches. Use: It is used off-label to manage withdrawal symptoms b ut does not address cravings or the underlying addiction.
