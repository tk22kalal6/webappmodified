      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "Correct answer: A) Etoricoxib Explanation: Etoricoxib , which is an NSAID, will not be used in chronic hyperuricemia/chronic gout. Instead, it can be used to treat acute gout attacks. Chronic gout: Persistence of pain and stiffness in joints in between the attacks. Other cardinal features are hyperuricemia, tophi, and urate stones in the kidney. In most cases, hyperuricemia is due to the under-secretion of uric acid, while in a few, it is due to overproduction. Chronic gouty arthritis may cause progressive deformities and permanent disabilities. Drugs used in chronic gout: Uricosurics: They increase uric acid excretion. Drugs: Probenecid, sulfinpyrazone, lesinurad, benzbromarone. Uric acid synthesis inhibitors: They inhibit xanthine oxidase, inhibiting uric acid synthesis.

      "question": "A patient complains of persistent pain and stiffness over both his big toes and right knee over the past 2 years. X-ray of big toe showed deposition of uric acid crystals. Which of the following is the most appropriate drug of choice to reduce uric acid levels?",
      "options": {
        "A": "Piroxicam",
        "B": "Allopurinol",
        "C": "Hydrocortisone",
        "D": "Etoricoxib"
      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Correct answer: B) Allopurinol Explanation: The given clinical scenario, along with the x-ray findings of the big toe, showing deposition of uric acid crystals, is suggestive of chronic gout and allopurinol is the most appropriate drug of choice among the given options. Rat bite erosions , also known as Martel sign or G sign , are seen in gout and refer to punched out erosions with sclerotic and overhanging margins. Allopurinol: Allopurinol was initially synthesized as an antineoplastic agent, but was later found to lack anti-cancer property, but an inhibitor of xanthine oxidase (XO). Both allopurinol and its primary metabolite, oxypurinol (alloxanthine) , reduce urate production by inhibiting XO, the enzyme that converts xanthine to uric acid. Allopurinol competitively inhibits XO at low concentrations and is a non-competitive inhibitor at high concentrations. It is the drug of choice for treatment of chronic gout , however there is a risk of acute attack in the beginning due to compensatory mobilisation of tissue stores into plasma. Hence, colchicine or NSAIDs are given along with in the beginning. Other uses of allopurinol: Tumour lysis syndrome. Lesch-Nyhan syndrome. Post-transplant patients. Piroxicam , E toricoxib (NSAIDS) and H ydrocortisone (steroids), are used in the management of acute gout attacks.

        "D": "Allopurinol is contraindicated during lactation."
      },
      "correct_answer": "D",
      "explanation": "Correct answer: D) Allopurinol is contraindicated during lactation. Explanation: Pharmacokinetics of allopurinol: Allopurinol (half-life of 2 hours ) is shorter acting than its metabolite alloxanthine (half-life of 24 hours ). (Option A) 80% of orally administered allopurinol is absorbed orally; it is not bound to plasma proteins and is metabolised to xanthine (Option B). Drug interactions: Allopurinol inhibits the degradation of 6-mercaptopurine and azathioprine, increasing their concentrations (Option C). Probenecid + allopurinol: Probenecid shortens the t1/2 of allopurinol. Allopurinol prolongs the t1/2 of probenecid. Allopurinol can potentiate warfarin and theophylline by inhibiting their metabolism. Allopurinol + ampicillin: Higher incidence of skin rashes. Contraindications: Hypersensitivity, pregnancy, and lactation (Option D). Cautious use is recommended in Extremes of age. Patients with kidney and liver disease.

      "question": "A 48-year-old man with a history of chronic gout presented with recurrent episodes of painful attacks despite being on allopurinol. His physician suggests a drug that inhibits the reabsorption of uric acid in the proximal tubules. Which of the following drugs uses this mechanism of action?",
      "options": {
        "A": "Probenicid",
        "B": "Febuxostat",
        "C": "Rasburicase",
        "D": "Colchicine"
      },
      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "Correct answer: A) Probenicid Explanation : Probenecid inhibits the URAT1 transporter in the proximal convoluted tubule, thereby reducing reabsorption of uric acid and increasing its excretion. It is classified as a uricosuric agent , effective in patients who under-excrete uric acid. It is useful in chronic gout, particularly when allopurinol or febuxostat alone is insufficient. Mechanisms of Action of Common Anti-Gout Drugs: Drug Class Mechanism of Action Use Probenecid Uricosuric agent Inhibits URAT1 transporter → ↓ uric acid reabsorption → ↑ excretion Chronic gout (under-excretors) Febuxostat Xanthine oxidase inhibitor Inhibits xanthine oxidase → ↓ uric acid production Chronic gout Rasburicase Uricolytic agent Converts uric acid to allantoin (soluble) Tumor lysis syndrome Colchicine Anti-inflammatory Inhibits microtubule polymerization → ↓ neutrophil activity Acute gout attacks Febuxostat (Option B): Incorrect because it inhibits xanthine oxidase , not uric acid reabsorption. Rasburicase (Option C): Incorrect because it converts uric acid to allantoin , used in tumor lysis syndrome, not chronic gout. Colchicine (Option D): Incorrect because it acts by inhibiting neutrophil chemotaxis and is used for acute gout , not for reducing uric acid levels chronically.
