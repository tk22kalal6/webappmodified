      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "Correct answer: A)1, 4, 2, 3, 5 Explanation: Mechanism of action of fluoroquinolones: Mechanism of Action of Fluoroquinolones Step Detail Inhibition of DNA Gyrase and Topoisomerase IV Fluoroquinolones specifically inhibit DNA gyrase and topoisomerase IV , which are critical for the maintenance of DNA structure. DNA gyrase alleviates DNA supercoiling ahead of the replication fork, while topoisomerase IV is involved in decatenation , which is the separation of replicated DNA. Disruption of DNA Supercoiling and Strand Separation The inhibition of these enzymes results in an accumulation of positive supercoils ahead of the replication fork and strand breaks in the DNA. This disrupts DNA replication and transcription processes by preventing the unwinding of DNA for these processes to occur. Hindrance of DNA Replication and Transcription With disrupted DNA replication and transcription, bacterial cells cannot synthesize new RNA or proteins, leading to a halt in growth and reproduction. Without proper DNA replication, the cell cannot reproduce, and without proper transcription, protein synthesis is blocked. Disruption of Bacterial Cell Division Due to the halted DNA replication and transcription, bacterial cell division is impaired. As bacteria need to replicate their DNA to divide, the inability to do so leads to cell cycle arrest . Bacterial Cell Death The failure in replication and transcription eventually causes bacterial cell death due to accumulated DNA damage and the inability to produce essential cellular components, including proteins. Fluoroquinolones work primarily by interfering with bacterial DNA replication through inhibition of DNA gyrase and topoisomerase IV . These drugs are bactericidal , meaning they directly kill bacteria , unlike bacteriostatic antibiotics that only inhibit bacterial growth. Their broad spectrum makes them effective against a variety of gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria , including those that cause respiratory and urinary tract infections.",
