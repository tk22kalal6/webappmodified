      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: B) Degradation of antibiotics Explanation: Resistance by lactamases against beta-lactam antibiotics is via degradation of the beta-lactam antibiotic. ß-lactam antibiotics MOA ß-lactam antibiotics inhibit the last step in peptidoglycan synthesis by acylating the transpeptidase via cleavage of the -CO-N-bond of the ß-lactam ring, thus inhibiting cell wall synthesis Drug groups 1. Penicillin 2. Cephalosporin 3. Carbapenems 4. Monobactam (Aztreonam) Resistance It occurs through one of the four mechanisms: Modification of target PBPs (Option A) III Impaired penetration of drugs to target PBPs III Antibiotic efflux (Option C) III Inactivation of antibiotic by lactamases (Option B) ß-lactamases are enzymes produced by certain bacteria that inactivate ß-lactam antibiotics by hydrolysis of the ß-lactam ring in their structure. Alteration in the 50s ribosome structure (Option D) is seen with protein synthesis inhibitor resistance.

      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: B) Chloroquine Explanation: Prolonged or high-dose use of chloroquine can lead to a condition known as chloroquine keratopathy, characterised by the drug's deposition in the cornea, specifically in the corneal epithelium and endothelium. Chloroquine MOA Chloroquine accumulates in acidic compartments of parasite-infected cells, disrupting heme polymerisation and inhibiting parasite growth and replication. Resistance Due to mutations in genes encoding transporters involved in chloroquine uptake and efflux, reducing chloroquine accumulation within parasites. Uses Malaria Treatment and Prophylaxis Amebiasis Leprae reaction Giardiasis Autoimmune Diseases (RA, SLE) S/E Ophthalmic: Bull's eye maculopathy, anterior subcapsular cataract, vortex keratopathy, corneal deposits Gastrointestinal: Nausea, vomiting, diarrhea Skin: Itching, rash, photosensitivity Neuropsychiatric: Agitation, confusion, hallucinations Cardiac: QT prolongation, cardiomyopathy (rare) Leflunomide (Option A) is an immunomodulatory drug used in rheumatoid arthritis. Its side effects are mainly hepatotoxicity, teratogenicity, and immunosuppression; it does not typically cause corneal deposits. Methotrexate (Option C) is an antimetabolite that primarily affects rapidly dividing cells. Its ocular side effects include conjunctivitis and rare cases of scleritis, but it does not cause corneal deposition. Sulfasalazine (Option D) is used for inflammatory bowel diseases, and rheumatoid arthritis may cause reversible yellow-orange discolouration of skin or urine, but it is not associated with corneal deposition.

      },
      "correct_answer": "D",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer D - Amoxicillin Amoxicillin is a frequently prescribed antibiotic, and one of its known side effects is the development of a maculopapular rash, which is a delayed hypersensitivity reaction and is a common sign of an allergic response to amoxicillin. It usually appears a few days after starting the medication, presenting as small, flat, reddened lesions that may be raised or papular. Aminopenicillin: Amoxicillin and Ampicillin are amino penicillins. Incidence of rashes is about 9%. Better oral absorption with lesser incidence of diarrhea More active against penicillin-resistant pneumococci Prednisolone (Option A) is a corticosteroid used to treat asthma and other inflammatory conditions. While corticosteroids can cause side effects such as skin thinning and increased susceptibility to skin infections, a maculopapular rash is not a typical adverse reaction to prednisolone. Salbutamol (Option B) is a bronchodilator used to manage asthma symptoms by relaxing airway muscles and improving airflow. It is not associated with causing a maculopapular rash as a side effect. Fexofenadine (Option D) is an antihistamine used to relieve allergy symptoms such as sneezing, itching, and runny nose. It is generally well-tolerated and does not typically cause a maculopapular rash as a side effect.

      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer C - Favipiravir Favipiravir (inhibits RNA polymerase) was initially approved for mild to moderate COVID-19 & not severe cases. However, the current protocol does not recommend the usage of Favipiravir. Low Molecular Weight Heparin (Option A) : Severe COVID-19 is often associated with an increased risk of blood clots and thromboembolic complications. LMWH is commonly used as both a prophylactic and therapeutic anticoagulant in hospitalized patients with severe COVID-19 to prevent or treat these issues. Oxygen (Option B) : Severe COVID-19 can lead to respiratory distress and hypoxemia (low oxygen levels). Supplemental oxygen therapy is essential in managing these cases, helping to maintain adequate oxygen levels and alleviate respiratory difficulties. Steroids (Option D) , such as dexamethasone, have been shown to reduce mortality and improve outcomes in hospitalized patients with severe COVID-19. These drugs have anti-inflammatory effects and help suppress the exaggerated immune response (cytokine storm), which can contribute to severe lung damage.

      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer B - RNA-dependent RNA polymerase inhibition Remdesivir acts by i nhibiting RNA-dependent RNA polymerase. It is an adenosine nucleotide prodrug. It is metabolized into Remdesivir triphosphate (RDV-TP), which binds to viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase. It inhibits viral replication via premature termination of RNA transcription. Remdesivir is used to treat COVID-19 and may be considered in those patients who require supplemental oxygen within 10 days of the onset of illnes.s Dose : 200 mg IV injection on day 1 followed by 100 mg IV daily for the next 4 days Adverse effects Hepatic enzyme elevation Increased prothrombin time Hypersensitivity reactions. Contraindications of Remdesivir: Renal impairment (eGRF <30ml/min/m2) Hepatic impairment (AST/ALT > 5 times the upper normal limit) Pregnancy or lactating women Less than 12 years of age Patients who are not on supplementary oxygen RNA-dependent DNA polymerase inhibition (Option A) is associated with anti-retroviral drugs such as Zidovudine and Lamivudine that target retroviruses like HIV, which use reverse transcriptase to synthesise DNA from RNA. Fusion inhibition (Option C), such as enfuvirtide , blocks the virus from entering host cells by preventing membrane fusion. Remdesivir acts after viral entry during the replication phase, not at the fusion step. Entry inhibitors (Option D) such as Maraviroc block the virus's entry into host cells by targeting cellular receptors or viral proteins. Remdesivir works after the virus has entered the cell.

        "A": "Ritonavir",
        "B": "Vitamin C",
        "C": "Cimetidine",
        "D": "Ganciclovir"
      },
      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer A - Ritonavir Ritonavir, when used in combination with saquinavir, increases the levels of saquinavir in the blood, thus enhancingthe bioavailability of saquinavir. Ritonavir is a protease inhibitor that is used to treat HIV. It inhibits the activity of an enzyme called cytochrome P450 (CYP3A4) which is responsible for breaking down saquinavir in the liver. By inhibiting the activity of this enzyme, ritonavir can increase the bioavailability of saquinavir, leading to higher levels of the medication in the blood and improved antiviral activity. This phenomenon is known as boosting of protease inhibitors by CYP inhibitors (Ritonavir, Cobicistat) All protease inhibitors except Nelfinavir are metabolised by CYP3A4 thus, their activity can be boosted. Saquinavir is also an HIV protease inhibitor that inhibits replication of both HIV-1 and HIV-2. Co-administration of Ritonavir and Saquinavir results in: Enhanced bioavailability of Saquinavir Inhibition of systemic clearance of Saquinavir Longer half-life of the protease inhibitor Reduction of drug dose and dosing frequency of Saquinavir Protease inhibitors (PI) MOA Inhibits the assembly/packaging of viral proteins Competitively inhibits the action of HIV aspartyl protease Pharmacokinetics All are CYP3A4 inhibitors: Except Nelfinavir (CYP2C9) Increases toxicity of other drugs Simvastatin: Risk of myopathy Midazolam: Causes respiratory depression Uses HIV treatment and 2nd line Post-exposure prophylaxis Drugs Ritonavir Maximum CYP inhibition → inhibits metabolism of other PI Low-dose ritonavir boosts other protease inhibitors (Lopinavir) Amprenavir Fos-amprenavir Tipranavir Indinavir Saquinavir (least CYP inhibitor) Lopinavir Atazanavir (no dyslipidemia) Nelfinavir Darunavir (maximum bioavailability, taken with food) Resistance P-glycoprotein efflux transporter Cross-resistance with other protease inhibitors. Vitamin C (Option B) is an essential nutrient that is involved in many important functions in the body, including immune function, collagen production, and wound healing. However, it is not known to have any significant effect on the bioavailability of saquinavir. Cimetidine (Option C) is a medication that is used to reduce stomach acid production and is sometimes used to treat acid reflux and ulcers. It can also inhibit the activity of cytochrome P450, which is involved in the metabolism of many medications, including saquinavir. However, current evidence suggests that cimetidine has only a modest effect on the bioavailability of saquinavir and may not be a reliable method for increasing saquinavir levels. Ganciclovir ( Option D) is an antiviral medication that is used to treat herpes viruses and cytomegalovirus (CMV) infections. It is not known to have any significant effect on the bioavailability of saquinavir, as it works through a different mechanism of action compared to saquinavir.

Red man syndrome Hemophilus alters penicillin-binding protein sites, hence resistant to ampicillin (Option A). This statement is false as Hemophilus produces beta-lactamases which makes them resistant to beta-lactam antibiotics. Easier to administer IV ceftriaxone than IV ampicillin (Option B ) as a single dose administration of ceftriaxone may be more convenient than the multiple daily doses required for ampicillin, but ease of administration is not the primary reason for switching from Ampicillin to Ceftriaxone. Cotrimoxazole is the drug of choice, but the patient is allergic to sulfa drugs (Option C ) Cotrimoxazole (trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole) is an antibiotic that is often used to treat Hemophilus influenzae infections. However, if the patient is allergic to sulfa drugs, cotrimoxazole may not be a suitable treatment option but in this patient, this is not the reason forthe change of ampicillin to ceftriaxone as there is no history of allergy to sulfa drugs.

      },
      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: C) Linezolid Explanation: Linezolid cannot be used in this patient due to the drug's side effect of causing bone marrow suppressio,n which can worsen the post-chemotherapy bone marrow suppression in this patient. Linezolid MOA Protein synthesis inhibitor of the class oxazolidinones Attaches to a site on the bacterial 23S ribosomal RNA of the 50S subunit Prevents the formation of a functional 70S initiation complex. It mainly acts against gram-positive organisms Uses Skin and skin structure infections by staphylococcus and streptococcus. II Community-acquired pneumonia due to streptococcus pneumoniae. II Nosocomial pneumonia due to staphylococcus aureus. Adverse effects Inhibits mitochondrial protein synthesis and may lead to Peripheral neuropathy Optic neuritis Lactic acidosis in patients receiving the drug for longer durations. II Serotonin syndrome when coadministered with adrenergic or serotonergic drugs like SSRIs due to its nonspecific MAO inhibition. Linezolid can cause myelosuppression, which can present as Anemia Thrombocytopenia Leukopenia Sometimes pancytopenia. It usually occurs 7-10 days after administration of the drug and is usually reversed on discontinuation of the drug. Cefepime (Option A) is a fourth-generation antipseudomonal cephalosporin. It is useful in enterobacter and pseudomonas infections that are resistant to other cephalosporins and it does not cause myelosuppression. Piperacillin-Tazobactam (Option B) is a combination of piperacillin, which is a ureidopenicillin, and tazobactam, which is a beta-lactamase inhibitor. It is useful in various infection,s including nosocomial infections, intraabdominal infections, pneumonia, and UTI. It does not cause myelosuppression; thus, it can be used with this patient. Meropenem (Option D) belongs to the carbapenem group of beta-lactam antibiotics. They are more active against gram-negative organisms. It does not cause myelosuppression; thus, it can be used with this patient.

      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: B) Cefoperazone Explanation: In a patient taking warfarin, the most likely Cephalosporine to cause hemarthrosis is Cefoperazone. Cephalosporins containing a methylthiotetrazole (NMTT) group can prolong the prothrombin time, which causes clinically significant bleeding in patients already on anticoagulant therapy or having vitamin K deficiency. NMTT cephalosporins inhibit the enzyme vitamin K epoxide reductase in the liver, which is the key enzyme for vitamin K-dependent carboxylation, which is essential for the biological activation of coagulation factors. NMTT group containing cephalosporins include latamoxef, cefoperazone, cefotetan and cefamandole. Vitamin K epoxide reductase is also the target of anticoagulants like warfarin thus, when a cephalosporin-containing NMTT group is given to a patient taking warfarin, it can lead to clinically significant bleeding such as Hearthrosis.

This will prevent the formation of UDP-N-acetyl muramic acid, precursor of N-acetyl muramic acid Step 2 (Option B) is inhibited by Cycloserine, which inhibits the formation of peptidoglycan cross-links by interfering with the synthesis of peptidoglycan. This will inhibit alanine racemase that converts L-alanine to D-alanine. Step 3 (Option C) is inhibited by Bacitracin, which blocks the dephosphorylation of the lipid carrier and prevents the recycling of the carrier required for peptidoglycan synthesis.

      },
      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: A) Uncomplicated gonorrhea Explanation: According to CDC, uncomplicated gonorrhea is managed by a single drug therapy of IM injection of 500 mg of Ceftriaxone rather than the previously used dual therapy of ceftriaxone and azithromycin. However, monotherapy should be given when concurrent chlamydia infection is ruled out; if not, presumptive treatment of chlamydia is also done by using oral Doxycyclin 100mg for 7 days. Tuberculosis (Option B) is a bacterial infection that is typically treated with a combination of antibiotics. This is because TB bacteria can develop resistance to single antibiotics if used alone. The standard treatment for active TB includes a combination of isoniazid, rifampin, pyrazinamide, and ethambutol, taken for several months. Intra-abdominal infections (Option C) are treated using antimicrobial combinations as the infection may be caused by a variety of bacteria. The combination of antibiotics used depends on the type of infection and the bacteria causing it. For example, in cases of complicated intra-abdominal infections, a combination of piperacillin-tazobactam plus metronidazole or cefotaxime plus metronidazole may be used. Malaria (Option D) is treated with antimicrobial combinations, especially in areas where drug resistance is high. This is because using a single antimalarial drug can lead to the development of drug-resistant strains of the malaria parasite. Examples of antimalarial combinations include atovaquone-proguanil, artemether-lumefantrine, and mefloquine-artesunate.

      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: B) Add dolutegravir 100 mg in the morning Explanation: The dose of Dolutegravir (Integrase inhibitor) has to be increased in this patient. Rifampicin, an Antitubercular drug, is a potent CYP inducer and therefore, the effect of Dolutegravir is reduced. Rifampicin is a potent inducer of the cytochrome P450 enzyme system. It enhances the metabolism of many drugs that are processed through this pathway. Add tenofovir 200 mg in the morning (Option A) : Tenofovir is an NRTI, and it does not undergo significant metabolism via CYP450 enzymes; hence, the induction effect of rifampicin does not impact its effectiveness or safety. No dose adjustment (Option C): This is incorrect, as Dolutegravir needs dose adjustments. Add lamivudine 200 mg in the morning (Option D): Lamivudine is also an NRTI, and it does not undergo significant metabolism via CYP450 enzymes; hence, the induction effect of rifampicin does not impact its effectiveness or safety.

Empiric Therapy: Outpatient: No comorbidities: Monotherapy with macrolides (azithromycin, clarithromycin). (Option A) With comorbidities (chronic lung/heart disease, diabetes, smoking, HIV): Newer fluoroquinolones (levofloxacin, moxifloxacin, gemifloxacin) or a combination of beta-lactam (e.g., amoxicillin) and a macrolide. Inpatient Non-ICU: Newer fluoroquinolones (levofloxacin, moxifloxacin) alone or a combination of beta-lactam (e.g., ampicillin, ceftriaxone) and a macrolide. (Option B) Inpatient ICU: Combination of macrolide (azithromycin) or newer fluoroquinolone (levofloxacin) with beta-lactam (e.g., ampicillin-sulbactam, ertapenem). (Option D) If risk of aspiration, consider ampicillin-sulbactam or ertapenem; for Pseudomonas infection, use anti-pseudomonal beta-lactam (e.g., piperacillin-tazobactam) with anti-pseudomonal fluoroquinolone (e.g., ciprofloxacin).

It has been shown to reduce parasite burden and mortality in severe malaria cases rapidly. Other options like quinine and artemether are also effective, but artesunate is generally favoured due to its faster onset of action and superior efficacy in severe malaria.

      "explanation": "Correct Answer: C) Disulfiram-like reaction Explanation: The patient's symptoms of nausea, vomiting, flushing, and hypotension after taking an anti-amoebic drug in the context of chronic alcohol use are indicative of a disulfiram-like reaction. Metronidazole is used in the treatment of amoebic colitis and liver abscesses, which has the potential to cause this reaction. Metronidazole has a structural similarity to disulfiram (the drug used to help people with alcohol dependence). Disulfiram works by irreversibly inhibiting ALDH , and metronidazole's action on ALDH mimics this effect, leading to the accumulation of acetaldehyde when alcohol is consumed. Delirium tremens (Option A) is a severe form of alcohol withdrawal that occurs typically 48-72 hours after the last drink in an alcoholic patient. Symptoms include confusion , hallucinations , severe agitation , and autonomic instability; it can also lead to cardiac arrhythmia. Alcohol withdrawal (Option B) occurs when a chronic alcoholic stops drinking, typically presenting with symptoms like tremors , anxiety , insomnia , nausea , sweating , and potentially seizures. However, the presence of flushing and hypotension after taking a drug strongly points toward a disulfiram-like reaction in the given condition. Hallucinosis (Option D) is a condition where the patient experiences visual or auditory hallucinations in the setting of acute intoxication or alcohol withdrawal, in the case of alcoholics. The patient's symptoms here are more consistent with a reaction from drug-alcohol interaction rather than hallucinations.

      "explanation": "Correct Answer: A) QT interval prolongation Explanation: Bedaquiline is an antitubercular drug used in the treatment of multidrug-resistant tuberculosis. QT prolongation is the most characteristic and clinically significant side effect of bedaquiline. Bedaquiline MOA It inhibits mycobacterial ATP synthase , a crucial enzyme involved in the energy production of Mycobacterium tuberculosis. By disrupting this process, bedaquiline effectively kills the bacteria. Reactions Cross-resistance is seen with clofazimine. Metabolism It is metabolised by CYP3A4. Hence, rifampicin, a CYP3A4 inducer, reduces its efficacy. Side effects Nausea and diarrhoea (common side effects) QT prolongation PR interval prolongation (Option B) is more commonly associated with drugs that affect AV nodal conduction , such as beta-blockers , calcium channel blockers , or digoxin , but not with bedaquiline. QRS widening (Option C) is commonly caused by class 1 antiarrhythmic drugs. It is generally associated with conduction disturbances or bundle branch blocks , but bedaquiline is not associated with this. ST-segment elevation (Option D) is caused by sodium channel blockers and occurs in acute myocardial infarction (MI) but is not a known side effect of bedaquiline.

      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "particularly CYP3A4, which can significantly lower the plasma concentrations of Nevirapine. Nevirapine is metabolized by the CYP3A4 enzyme, and induction of this enzyme by rifampicin can lead to subtherapeutic levels of Nevirapine, reducing its effectiveness in managing HIV. This interaction can lead to treatment failure and the development of drug resistance. Therefore, rifampicin should be avoided or used with extreme caution, and alternative antiretroviral drugs or anti-tuberculosis medications should be considered. Incorrect Options: Option B - Streptomycin: Streptomycin is an aminoglycoside antibiotic used primarily for the treatment of tuberculosis. It does not have significant interactions with the antiretroviral drugs Zidovudine, Lamivudine, or Nevirapine. Therefore, it can be used safely in combination with this regimen without the risk of significant drug interactions. Option C - INH (Isoniazid): Isoniazid (INH) is commonly used in the treatment and prophylaxis of tuberculosis. It does not significantly interact with Zidovudine, Lamivudine, or Nevirapine, and can generally be used safely in patients receiving this combination antiretroviral therapy. There may be some concern about hepatotoxicity when used with other hepatotoxic drugs, but this does not constitute a direct contraindication. Option D - Ethambutol: Ethambutol is another first-line anti-tuberculosis medication. It has minimal drug interactions with antiretroviral drugs, including Zidovudine, Lamivudine, and Nevirapine. Ethambutol can be used safely in combination with this HIV regimen without significant concerns for drug interactions.",

      },
      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "genes Genes: Bedaquiline is typically used for treating multidrug-resistant (MDR) tuberculosis, which includes cases with resistance to both rifampicin and isoniazid. This includes strains with mutations in the inhA and katG genes, which are associated with isoniazid resistance. Bedaquiline is considered in such cases when other second-line drugs are not effective or suitable, providing a vital treatment option for MDR-TB. Incorrect Options: Option B - Resistance to Rifampicin but Sensitivity to Fluoroquinolones: While resistance to rifampicin is a key factor in MDR-TB, the inclusion criterion for starting bedaquiline is more specific. Sensitivity to fluoroquinolones alone does not meet the criteria for bedaquiline use; it is usually considered in the broader context of multidrug-resistant TB, including resistance to both rifampicin and isoniazid. Option C - Resistance to Rifampicin and Sensitivity to Isoniazid: Resistance to rifampicin and sensitivity to isoniazid would be classified as rifampicin-resistant TB rather than MDR-TB. Bedaquiline is typically used for MDR-TB, which involves resistance to both rifampicin and isoniazid, not just one. Option D - Resistance to Both Rifampicin and Fluoroquinolones: Resistance to both rifampicin and fluoroquinolones suggests a more severe form of drug-resistant TB, potentially extensively drug-resistant (XDR-TB). Bedaquiline may still be used in such cases, but the initial criterion for starting it is based on MDR-TB, which includes resistance to both rifampicin and isoniazid.",

        "D": "Development of drug resistance to ART"
      },
      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "starting ART in an HIV-TB co-infected patient is most likely due to Immune Reconstitution Inflammatory Syndrome (IRIS) , which is caused by immunological changes in response to ART. Mechanism: ART restores CD4+ T-cell function and improves the immune response. This leads to a stronger inflammatory response against pre-existing TB infection, worsening symptoms. IRIS typically occurs 2–12 weeks after ART initiation . Clinical Presentation: Worsening TB symptoms (fever, lymphadenopathy, worsening respiratory symptoms). New inflammatory lesions (e.g., enlarging TB lymph nodes, worsening pleural effusions). No evidence of drug resistance . Management: Continue both TB treatment and ART . NSAIDs or corticosteroids may be used for severe cases. HIV-positive individuals face an 8-fold increased risk of developing TB and are prone to more severe and potentially fatal extrapulmonary TB. To manage co-infection, ATT is initiated first, followed by ART after 2 weeks to mitigate the risk of Immune Reconstitution Inflammatory Syndrome (IRIS), an exaggerated inflammatory response. Rifampin, a potent CYP inducer in ATT, accelerates the metabolism of certain ART drugs like nevirapine (NNRTI), dolutegravir (integrase inhibitor), and protease inhibitors (e.g., Ritonavir, Indinavir, lopinavir), reducing their effectiveness. However, nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs) and efavirenz can be safely combined with Rifampin. Rifabutin, a weaker enzyme inducer, is often used as an alternative to mitigate drug interactions in ART. All HIV-positive TB patients should also receive cotrimoxazole preventive therapy to guard against Pneumocystis jirovecii infection. Development of drug resistance to TB drugs (Option A) is incorrect because TB drug resistance develops over months to years , whereas IRIS occurs within weeks of ART initiation . Drug-drug interactions between TB and ART medications (Option B) is incorrect because although interactions (e.g., rifampicin reducing ART levels ) are common, they usually lead to virologic failure , not an inflammatory worsening. Development of drug resistance to ART (Option D) is incorrect because ART resistance presents with viral load rebound and worsening HIV, not a paradoxical inflammatory response.

      "correct_answer": "D",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: D) 4 Explanation: Beta-lactam antibiotics work by inhibiting the action of enzymes involved in cell wall synthesis, weakening the cell wall and making it more susceptible to osmotic pressure. The given diagram shows the steps in bacterial cell wall formation. The various steps involved in bacterial cell wall formation are: UDP-N-acetylglucosamine (UDP-NAG) and UDP-N-acetylmuramic acid (UDP-NAM) are synthesized in the cytoplasm of the bacterial cell. UDP-NAM is linked to a lipid carrier molecule called bactoprenol phosphate, which forms lipid II. Lipid II is flipped across the cytoplasmic membrane to the outer surface, where it is incorporated into the growing cell wall. The peptide chains of adjacent lipid II molecules are cross-linked by enzymes called transpeptidases , also known as penicillin-binding proteins (PBPs). Based on the above steps, the site of action of beta-lactam antibiotics is option 4, which is the site where transpeptidases or PBPs are involved in cross-linking the peptide chains of adjacent lipid II molecules. Beta-lactam antibiotics, such as penicillins, cephalosporins, and carbapenems, work by irreversibly binding to the active site of PBP s, thereby inhibiting their function. This leads to a weakened cell wall and eventual cell death Reference: K D Tripathi, Essentials of Medical Pharmacology, 8th Edition, Page 771, 774, 775 Essentials of Medical Microbiology, Apurba S Sastry, 3rd Edition, Page 16, 17, 18",

      "explanation": "Correct Answer A) Clotrimazole The condition characterized by patchy lesions on the tongue and buccal mucosa resulting from the use of inhaled steroids is oral thrush, which can be treated with Clotrimazole . Clotrimazole is a topical antifungal medication (imidazole) that effectively penetrates the skin layers to treat superficial fungal infections. Mechanism of action: Inhibit 14 alpha demethylase enzyme (CYP), which converts lanosterol into ergosterol cell membrane, hence decreasing cell membrane synthesis. All azoles are metabolized by the CYP2C19 enzyme. It is commonly used in the treatment of conditions such as oral thrush, tinea, and candidiasis. Griseofulvin (Option B) acts by inhibiting microtubules within fungal cells, thereby disrupting mitosis. It is the drug of choice for superficial fungal infections, such as tinea. However, it can cause side effects, including headache, neuritis, hepatitis, photosensitivity, and a disulfiram-like reaction. Terbinafine (Option C) is an allylamine antifungal that inhibits squalene epoxidase, reducing ergosterol synthesis and disrupting cell membrane integrity. It is the drug of choice for onychomycosis (fungal nail infections), tinea capitis (scalp ringworm), and extensive fungal lesions. Flucytosine (Option D) acts as an inhibitor of thymidylate synthase and is a narrow-spectrum fungistatic agent effective against Cryptococcus neoformans and chromoblastomycosis.

      "explanation": "mechanism of action of Flucytosine is different. Flucytosine is an antifungal medication that is converted into 5-fluorouracil within fungal cells. It interferes with fungal RNA and protein synthesis by inhibiting fungal DNA and RNA synthesis. It is primarily used in combination with other antifungal drugs for the treatment of systemic fungal infections. Incorrect Options: Option A - Ketoconazole: Lanosterol-14-demethylase inhibition: Lanosterol-14-demethylase inhibition Ketoconazole is an antifungal medication that works by inhibiting the enzyme lanosterol-14-demethylase. This enzyme is responsible for converting lanosterol into ergosterol, which is an essential component of fungal cell membranes. By inhibiting this enzyme, ketoconazole disrupts the synthesis of ergosterol and leads to the accumulation of abnormal fungal cell membranes, ultimately causing fungal cell death. Option C - Terbinafine: Squalene epoxidase inhibition: Terbinafine is an antifungal drug that inhibits the enzyme squalene epoxidase. This enzyme is involved in the synthesis of ergosterol, an essential component of fungal cell membranes. By inhibiting squalene epoxidase, terbinafine disrupts ergosterol synthesis and leads to the accumulation of squalene, causing fungal cell death. Option D - Amphotericin B: Sequesters ergosterol: Sequesters ergosterol Amphotericin B is a broad-spectrum antifungal medication that binds to ergosterol, a key component of fungal cell membranes. It forms a complex with ergosterol, which results in the formation of pores or channels in the fungal cell membrane. This disruption of the cell membrane integrity leads to the leakage of intracellular contents and ultimately results in fungal cell death. Reference: Prepladder Notes",

Incorrect Options: Option A - Vancomycin: Vancomycin is an antibiotic used to treat systemic infections caused by MRSA. It is not specifically indicated for nasal carriers. Option B - Teicoplanin: Teicoplanin is another antibiotic with activity against MRSA. Like Vancomycin, it is not the preferred choice for nasal carriers. Option D - Linezolid : Linezolid is an antibiotic used for the treatment of infections caused by MRSA. However, Mupirocin is the specific drug of choice for nasal carriers in this context Reference: Prepladder Notes",

      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "admitted to the hospital for community-acquired pneumonia, combination therapy of beta-lactams and azithromycin is given. This assertion is true, as this combination therapy is a commonly recommended approach for treating community-acquired pneumonia. The reason provided is that this combination covers Gram-positive organisms and anaerobes. However, this reason is false. Beta-lactams, such as penicillin or cephalosporins, primarily target Gram-positive bacteria, while azithromycin has broader coverage against Gram-negative bacteria and atypical pathogens. It does not specifically target anaerobes. Therefore, the reason is incorrect and does not provide a valid explanation for the assertion. Incorrect Options: Option A - Both assertion and reason are true, and the reason is the correct explanation for the assertion: This option is incorrect because the reason provided is false. Option B - Both assertion and reason are true, but the reason is not the correct explanation for the assertion: This option is incorrect because the reason provided is false and does not explain the assertion. Option D - Both assertion and reason are false : This option is incorrect because the assertion is true, but the reason is false. Reference: Prepladder Notes",

      },
      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "maximally due to the use of lincosamides. Lincosamides are a class of antibiotics that includes drugs like clindamycin. These antibiotics have been strongly associated with the development of CDAD. They disrupt the normal gut microbiota, allowing Clostridium difficile, a bacteria that can cause diarrhea, to overgrow and produce toxins. Incorrect Options: Option B - Tetracyclines: While tetracyclines can also be associated with the development of CDAD, lincosamides have a higher association. Option C - Carbapenems: Carbapenems, a broad-spectrum antibiotic class, are not typically associated with an increased risk of CDAD. However, they can disrupt the normal gut microbiota and lead to other gastrointestinal side effects. Option D - Macrolides: Macrolides, such as erythromycin or azithromycin, have a lower risk of causing CDAD compared to lincosamides. They are not commonly associated with CDAD, although they can have other gastrointestinal side effects. Reference: Prepladder Notes",
