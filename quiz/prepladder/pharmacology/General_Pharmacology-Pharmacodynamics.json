Nitrites and Cyanide: Nitrites form methemoglobin, which reacts with cyanide radicals. Physical Antagonist (Option A) Physical methods are used to counteract the effects of a substance, often not involving receptor interactions. Activated charcoal is used to physically adsorb toxins in the gastrointestinal tract to prevent their absorption. Physiological Antagonist (Option B) Involves two agents that produce opposite effects on the same physiological function without interacting directly with each other or the same receptor. Insulin and glucagon are physiological antagonists. Insulin lowers blood glucose levels, while glucagon raises them. Histamine and adrenaline on bronchial muscles and blood pressure.

      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: A) 10-20 mcg/ml The median effective dose (ED50) refers to the dose of a drug or biologic that produces a specific beneficial therapeutic response in 50% of the population that takes that dose. LD stands for \"Lethal Dose\". LD 50 is the amount of a material, given all at once, which causes the death of 50% (one-half) of a group of test animals. The Therapeutic Range is the range between the minimal therapeutic effect and the maximal acceptable adverse effect (i.e., the range between ED50 and TD50). The drug doesn't work below ED50 (Area A) and is lethal above TD50. 10-20 mcg/ml is the therapeutic range of phenytoin, which implies that the drug doesn't work below 10 mcg/ml and is lethal above 20 mcg/ml. The aim is to maintain the plasma concentration between this range for maximal therapeutic efficacy and safety.
