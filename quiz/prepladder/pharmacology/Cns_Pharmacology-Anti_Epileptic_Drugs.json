      "explanation": "Correct Answer: D) Ethosuximide Explanation: The clinical scenario is characteristic of typical absence seizures, a type of generalised onset non-motor seizure with unresponsiveness and staring spells. They are generally seen in children aged 5 to 15 years. A classic EEG finding of a 3-Hz spike and wave discharges is found. Ethosuximide is the drug of choice in typical absence seizures. It blocks T-type calcium channels in the thalamus and prevents the firing of action potential to the cortex. Valproate (Option A) is the DOC in atypical absence seizures. Phenytoin (Option B) and Carbamazepine (Option C) are contraindicated in the Absence seizures.

      "explanation": "Correct Answer: D) Causes purple glove syndrome Explanation: Valproate does not cause purple glove syndrome — this condition is classically associated with IV phenytoin , not valproate. Purple glove syndrome presents as pain, swelling, and purple-black discoloration distal to the site of phenytoin injection. Valproate, on the other hand, has its own unique adverse effect profile, including hepatotoxicity , pancreatitis , hyperammonemia , and teratogenicity .

      "explanation": "Correct Answer: D) Weight Loss Explanation: Weight Loss is not a side effect of phenytoin use. Phenytoin is an antiepileptic medication primarily used to manage and prevent seizures, particularly in the context of epilepsy. It is a sodium channel blocker that stabilises the neuronal membrane by inhibiting the repetitive firing of action potentials. This action helps to reduce the occurrence and severity of seizures in individuals with epilepsy. Adverse effects of Phenytoin include: Gum Hypertrophy : Overgrowth of gingival collagen fibres can cause significant dental and oral health issues. Hirsutism and Acne : Excessive hair growth and acne are common dermatological side effects. Coarsening of Facial Features : Long-term use can lead to noticeable changes in facial appearance. Hypersensitivity Reactions : These can manifest as rashes, discoid lupus erythematosus, lymphadenopathy, and neutropenia. Megaloblastic Anemia : Phenytoin can interfere with folate absorption, leading to anaemia. Osteomalacia : Bone softening or weakening can occur due to interference with vitamin D metabolism. Hyperglycemia : Inhibition of insulin release can result in elevated blood sugar levels. Toxicity : Symptoms of toxicity include diplopia, nystagmus, and ataxia. During Pregnancy : Fetal hydantoin syndrome is a risk, characterised by hypoplastic phalanges, cleft palate, harelip, and microcephaly.

Aspects Description Mechanism of Action Levetiracetam binds to synaptic vesicular protein SV2A, modulating neurotransmitter release (e.g., glutamate, GABA) and inhibiting N-type calcium channels. Uses It is used for the management of partial seizures and myoclonic epilepsy. It is also utilised as adjunctive therapy for refractory partial seizures. Additionally, it serves as second-line adjunctive therapy for generalised tonic-clonic seizures and absence seizures, although it is not approved for children below 4 years. Side effects Sleepiness, dizziness, weakness, behavioural changes (rare) and potential driving impairment. It is generally well-tolerated and is not metabolised by CYP enzymes, resulting in minimal drug interactions. Reference: K D Tripathi, Essentials of Medical Pharmacology, 8th Edition, Page 477",

      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: C) 10 to 20 mcg/ml Explanation: Phenytoin's therapeutic range refers to the optimal concentration of the drug in the bloodstream to achieve effective seizure control while minimising the risk of toxicity. The target range for maintaining therapeutic efficacy with phenytoin therapy is commonly accepted to be 10 to 20 mcg/ml. Phenytoin is metabolised in the liver primarily by CYP2C9 and CYP2C19. Over the therapeutic range, its kinetics shift from first-order to zero-order, leading to disproportionately high plasma concentrations with small dose increments. Monitoring plasma levels assists in dosage adjustments due to its capacity-limited metabolism. Therapeutic Drug Monitoring (TDM) involves measuring drug concentrations in the blood to ensure patients are within the therapeutic range and adjusting dosage as needed.

      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: C) Topiramate Explanation: In the given case scenario, adding topiramate to the patient's existing regimen may help with seizure control and weight management, making it the most appropriate choice. Topiramate and Zonisamide are two anti-epileptic drugs (AEDs) that have been associated with weight loss . In contrast, many other AEDs, such as Valproic acid , Gabapentin (Option B) , and Carbamazepine (Option A) , are known to cause weight gain , possibly due to their effects on appetite stimulation and metabolic changes. Category Topiramate (Option C) Zonisamide Mechanism of Action Acts through various mechanisms, including enhancing GABA-mediated inhibition and inhibiting sodium/calcium channels and carbonic anhydrase. Indications FDA-approved for partial-onset seizures, generalised tonic-clonic seizures, Lennox-Gastaut syndrome, and migraine prophylaxis. FDA-approved for adjunctive treatment of partial-onset seizures in adults. Weight Loss Associated with significant weight loss due to suppression of appetite and increased energy expenditure. Anti-Obesity Drug Combination with phentermine (Qsymia) is FDA-approved for chronic weight management in adults with BMI ≥ 30 or ≥ 27 with a weight-related comorbidity. It is investigated as a potential anti-obesity medication but is not currently FDA-approved for this indication. Reference: K D Tripathi, Essentials of Medical Pharmacology, 8th Edition, Page 447",

      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: C) Vigabatrin Explanation: Vigabatrin is an antiepileptic drug used for infantile spasms and refractory complex partial seizures. It acts by irreversibly inhibiting GABA transaminase to increase GABA levels in the brain. Vigabatrin is associated with a significant risk of permanent peripheral visual field defects and retinal toxicity , necessitating regular ophthalmologic monitoring to detect and manage potential visual impairments early. Carbamazepine (Option A) and Valproic acid (Option B) can cause a few ophthalmic side effects, including visual disturbances such as diplopia and blurred vision, but not associated with permanent visual loss. Among the given options, Levetiracetam (Option D) is considered to have a favourable safety profile with minimal ophthalmic side effects.
