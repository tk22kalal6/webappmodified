      "question": "A 60-year-old male with a history of hypertension presents to the emergency with a sudden onset of chest pain radiating to his jaw. The pain started 35 minutes ago while he was walking and has not improved with rest. On physical examination, ECG showed ST-segment depression in the anterior leads. What is the most appropriate initial treatment for managing this condition?",
      "options": {
        "A": "Atenolol",
        "B": "Nitroglycerin",
        "C": "Aspirin",
        "D": "Clopidogrel"
      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "showing ST changes suggests acute angina with sublingual nitroglycerin as a drug of choice. Angina pectoris is characterised by chest pain caused by reduced blood flow and oxygen supply to the heart muscle. The pain is elicited by the metabolites that accumulate due to myocardial ischaemia. Nitrates: They are best to abort an acute attack of angina. MOA: Venodilation → Reduce preload → Reduce myocardial contractility → Decreased O 2 demand Other beneficial effects: Dilates coronary artery (increase cGMP): effective in vasospastic angina. Redistribution of coronary blood flow to the ischemic area ( Robinhood phenomenon ). Uses: Angina (stable, vasospastic and chronic) Acute coronary syndrome or myocardial infarction (STEMI/NSTEMI) Acute pulmonary edema Abdominal colicky pain Beta-blockers( OPTION A) like atenolol are important in the long-term management of angina; they are not the immediate treatment for acute pain relief. Aspirin ( OPTION C) prevents platelet aggregation and reduces the risk of future ischemic events but does not relieve acute chest pain. Clopidogrel ( OPTION D) is an antiplatelet agent used to prevent further ischemic events but does not provide immediate relief of acute angina symptoms.

        "A": "It dilates coronary blood vessels by blocking beta-2 receptors in the heart.",
        "B": "It decreases myocardial oxygen demand by reducing heart rate and contractility.",

      "explanation": "contractility. lowers the heart's oxygen demand, decreasing the likelihood of future angina episodes. They also reduce the heart's workload by lowering blood pressure and heart rate. Chronic stable angina (Common form): Attacks are predictably provoked (stable angina) by exercise, emotion, eating or coitus. Pathogenesis: Atherosclerotic plaque → gradual → ↓ blood supply to myocardium → ↓ O 2 supply to myocardium → Anginal attack Beta-blockers: DOC in chronic stable angina. MOA: Side effects: Risk of vasoconstriction (block beta-2 receptor in coronary arteries). (Option C) Risk of Vasospastic angina. Alternate treatment for chronic angina: Calcium channel blockers and nitrates.

Her resting ECG shows transient ST-segment elevation with a normal coronary angiogram. Which of the following most appropriately matches the treatment and mechanism of action of the drug of choice? Drug Mechanism of Action 1. Nitroglycerin a. Reduce myocardial oxygen demand by decreasing heart rate. 2. Propranolol b. Vasodilates coronary arteries by increasing cGMP. 3. Nifedipine c. Inhibit calcium influx into vascular smooth muscle and cardiac cells. 4. Aspirin d. Inhibits platelet aggregation by irreversibly acetylating cyclooxygenase.",

      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: A) 3 and c Explanation: This young female has recurring chest pain with ECG changes and a normal coronary artery angiogram, suggesting prinzmetal angina as the most likely diagnosis, with calcium channel blockers (nifedipine) as the treatment of choice. Chronic Vasospastic angina (Prinzmetal angina) occurs due to recurrent localised (occasionally) coronary vasospasm , which may be superimposed on arteriosclerotic coronary artery disease. Attacks occur at rest or during sleep and are predictable. DOC- Calcium channel blockers (Dihydropyridine type) Calcium channel blockers DHP Non-DHP MOA: Coronary artery dilator Drugs: Amlodipine, Nifedipine and Felodipine. Use: Chronic Vasospastic angina Combined with beta-blockers to reduce the risk of tachycardia. MOA- Decrease heart rate and O 2 demand (heart & coronary artery). Drugs: Verapamil, Diltiazem Uses: Stable angina, Coronary dilator and Vasospastic angina. Never combined with beta-blockers (marked bradycardia). Other treatment options are long-acting nitrates, oral nitrates and transdermal patches. Propranolol (Option B) is a beta-blocker that reduces myocardial oxygen demand by decreasing heart rate but does not cause vasodilation via cGMP. It can worsen coronary vasospasm in Prinzmetal’s angina. Nitroglycerin (Option C) causes vasodilation by increasing cGMP, not by inhibiting cyclooxygenase, which is the action of aspirin. Aspirin (Option D) inhibits cyclooxygenase, preventing platelet aggregation and does not affect heart rate or myocardial oxygen demand directly.

Which of the following statements regarding the management of his acute chest pain is true? Nitrates can be safely administered as they enhance vasodilation by increasing cyclic GMP.
