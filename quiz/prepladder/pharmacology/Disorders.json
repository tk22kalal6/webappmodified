        "D": "Carbamazepine"
      },
      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: A) Trihexyphenidyl Explanation: The clinical presentation, along with the presence of rheumatic heart disease, is suggestive of Sydenham’s chorea and anticholinergics like trihexyphenidyl will not be used in managing this. Sydenham’s chorea is characterised by unexpected, involuntary, and irregular movements of the upper limbs and head and characteristic darting movements of the tongue. This can be due to dopaminergic excess in certain brain areas, and anticholinergics should not be given because central cholinergic excess will worsen symptoms. Drugs used in the management of Sydenham’s chorea: Haloperidol. (Option B ruled out) Sodium valproate. (Option C ruled out) Carbamazepine. (Option D ruled out) Corticosteroids (refractory cases).

      },
      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: C) Acting as a dopamine precursor Explanation: The patient's 2-year history of resting hand tremors, muscle rigidity, and shuffling gait suggests primary Parkinson's disease. Levodopa, a dopamine precursor, is the treatment of choice for replenishing brain dopamine levels in this patient. Primary Parkinson's disease: Idiopathic progressive neurodegenerative disease of dopaminergic neurons in the basal ganglia. Symptoms: rigidity, bradykinesia (slow movement), resting tremors, shuffling gait Treatment: Levodopa: DOC in Parkinson’s disease > 65 years The drug is converted into dopamine inside the basal ganglia via dopa decarboxylase. Crosses the BBB and replenishes the dopamine level in the CNS Degraded via MAO-B and COMT enzymes. Alternative treatment options: Amantadine is an NMDA antagonist and increases dopamine release. ( O ption A). COMT inhibitors (Entacapone, Tolcapone) and MAO inhibitors (Rasagiline, Selegiline) : Prevent dopamine degradation. ( Option B ) Benztropine: Reduces central cholinergic activity by blocking muscarinic receptors.

      "question": "A 60-year-old male with a history of glaucoma was recently diagnosed with primary Parkinson's disease and started treatment with syndopa (levodopa-carbidopa) therapy. The patient inquires about potential adverse events associated with the treatment. Which of the following statements is false? Nausea is the most common adverse effect due to the activation of D2 receptors inside the GIT. Dyskinesias and impulsiveness are common adverse effects associated with long-term levodopa use. Levodopa is contraindicated in this patient with a history of narrow-angle glaucoma. Long-term use of levodopa is associated with fluctuations in motor symptoms. Levodopa increases treatment efficacy with carbidopa.",

      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: B) Only 1 Explanation: Adverse events associated with Levodopa Side effects 1. Peripheral side effects: Nausea/ vomiting: (Statement 1) Most common Due to D2 receptor activation in CTZ outside the blood-brain barrier . Treat with domperidone (Blocks D2 receptor) Postural hypotension (D1 receptor-induced vasodilation) Mydriasis (Stimulates alpha-1 receptor in the iris) Arrhythmia (Stimulates cardiac beta-1 receptor) Note: Combining Levodopa with peripheral dopa decarboxylase inhibitors (Carbidopa/Bensarazide) prevents peripheral side effects. (Statement 5) 2. CNS side effects: Dyskinesia : Treat with Amantadine, Levetiracetam (Statement 2) Psychosis: Clozapine, Quetiapine Hypersexuality/ impulsiveness 3. Wearing off phenomenon Reduced effect of levodopa with decreased neuron number 4.

      "question": "A patient who was diagnosed with Parkinson’s disease and started on syndopa a few months ago now complains of worsening rigidity and dyskinesia in between brief periods of improvement. Which of the following is the least preferred add-on drug for this patient?",
      "options": {
        "A": "Istradefylline",
        "B": "Entacapone",
        "C": "Apomorphine",
        "D": "Tolcapone"
      },
      "correct_answer": "D",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: D) Tolcapone Explanation: The patient is showing signs of motor fluctuations , specifically the “on-off” phenomenon seen with chronic levodopa therapy. Tolcapone , though effective as a COMT inhibitor, is least preferred due to: Risk of severe hepatotoxicity Requirement for frequent liver function monitoring Safer alternatives like entacapone and istradefylline are available. “On-Off” Phenomenon in Parkinson’s Disease Phase Description “On” Phase Periods of good motor function after levodopa dose “Off” Phase Sudden return of parkinsonian symptoms as drug effect wanes Wearing Off Gradual decline in drug efficacy before next dose Freezing Temporary inability to initiate movement (usually in “off” state) Add-On Medications in “On-Off” Management Drug Class/Target Mechanism Use in On-Off Remarks Entacapone COMT inhibitor Inhibits peripheral levodopa breakdown Prolongs “on” time Preferred COMT inhibitor Tolcapone COMT inhibitor Inhibits central + peripheral COMT Similar effect but with hepatotoxicity Least preferred Apomorphine Dopamine agonist (rescue) Direct D1/D2 receptor stimulation Used for sudden “off” episodes Rapid-acting, subcutaneous Istradefylline Adenosine A2A antagonist Enhances dopaminergic activity in indirect pathway Reduces “off” periods Favorable side-effect profile Selegiline MAO-B inhibitor Inhibits dopamine metabolism Reduces wearing-off effects Neuroprotective role suggested Amantadine NMDA antagonist Increases dopamine release, reduces glutamate Used for levodopa-induced dyskinesia Add-on in advanced stages Istradefylline (Option A): Incorrect – Well-tolerated adjunct for reducing “off” time via adenosine A2A receptor blockade. Entacapone (Option B): Incorrect – Widely used and preferred COMT inhibitor without liver toxicity. Apomorphine (Option C): Incorrect – Short-acting dopamine agonist used for rescue in acute “off” episodes.

      "question": "A patient was diagnosed with Parkinson’s disease and started on drugs for the same 6 months ago. She now presents for a review with complaints of skin discolouration, as shown in the image below. Which of the following antiparkinson agents would have caused this presentation?",
      "options": {
        "A": "Rasagiline",
        "B": "Trihexyphenidyl",
        "C": "Amantadine",
        "D": "Ropinirole"
      },
      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: C) Amantadine Explanation: The skin discolouration given above, with a history of treatment for parkinsonism, is suggestive of livedo reticularis, which can occur as a side effect of using amantadine. Livedo reticularis occurs due to the release of catecholamines, which result in peripheral vasoconstriction. Amantadine: Amantadine acts primarily by promoting dopamine release in the brain and NMDA receptor antagonism. Amantadine can be used in milder cases or short courses to supplement levodopa for advanced cases. In the latter situation, it suppresses motor fluctuations and abnormal movements. A fixed dose of 100 mg BO is used (not titrated according to response). The effect of a single dose lasts 8- 12 hours. Other side effects: Insomnia. Restlessness. Confusion. Nightmares. Anticholinergic effects. Hallucinations (rare). Ankle oedema. Reference: Essentials of Medical Pharmacology- K.D Tripathi, 8th Edition, Page: 460",

        "C": "The efficacy of apomorphine improves when combined with ondansetron",
        "D": "Ropinirole proves best in managing restless leg syndrome"
      },
      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: C) The efficacy of apomorphine improves when combined with ondansetron injectable dopamine agonist which acts predominantly on the D4 dopaminergic receptors. It causes profound hypotension and loss of consciousness when combined with serotonergic antiemetics (5HT3 antagonists like ondansetron) and hence is contraindicated to combine with them. Other side effects: Q T prolongation. Incorrect Options: Ropinirole and pramipexole are other non-ergot derivatives that are selective dopaminergic D2/D3 receptor agonists. Improvement in symptoms can be seen much quicker (as early as 1-2 weeks) when compared with bromocriptine (which may take months) (OPTION A) Ropinirole is one of the drugs preferred as an add-on during the on/off phase (OPTION C) and is also approved by the FDA for use in restless leg syndrome (OPTION D) Note: Dopamine agonists like bromocriptine and cabergoline are ergot derivatives.

      "correct_answer": "D",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: D) Benzhexol Explanation: The above-mentioned clinical vignette is suggestive of drug-induced parkinsonism, and central anticholinergics like benzhexol (trihexyphenidyl) are the only drugs of choice for this condition. Drugs causing Parkinsonism: MOA: Dopaminergic antagonism. Drugs: Metoclopramide. Haloperidol. Domperidone. Prochlorperazine. Central anticholinergics: Patients with Parkinsonism have neurochemical imbalances in the brain, with a reduction in dopamine and an increase in acetylcholine levels together responsible for the symptoms. These drugs have high central: peripheral anticholinergic action , hence used in parkinsonism. They include: Trihexyphenidyl (Benzhexol). Procyclidine. Biperiden, Orphenadrine.",

      "explanation": "Correct Answer: B) Donepezil Explanation: Donepezil will not be used in the management of Lou Gehrig's disease. Lou Gehrig’s disease/amyotrophic lateral sclerosis is an inherited motor neuron disorder affecting both upper and lower motor neurons, leading to progressive muscle weakness, muscular atrophy and dysarthria. Death usually occurs by respiratory failure. Drugs used in the management of ALS: Direct action on the nervous system Symptomatic (relieve spasticity) Riluzole. Edaravone. Baclofen. Tizanidine. Clonazepam (should be used cautiously as it can cause respiratory depression in advanced ALS). Toferson is a recently approved drug for the management of ALS. It is an antisense oligonucleotide that targets SOD1 mRNA to reduce the synthesis of SOD1 protein. Tizanidine (Option A): Correct because it is used to manage spasticity in ALS patients, providing symptomatic relief. Edaravone (Option C): Correct because it is an antioxidant that reduces oxidative stress and is approved for ALS to slow progression. Riluzole (Option D): Correct because it slows disease progression by inhibiting glutamate toxicity , which is involved in ALS.
