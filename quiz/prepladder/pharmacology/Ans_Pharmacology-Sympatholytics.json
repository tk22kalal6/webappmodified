The Vasomotor reversal of Dale is a phenomenon in which the effect of adrenaline (epinephrine) is reversed from vasoconstriction to vasodilation due to the blockade of α receptors by an α -blocker. In this scenario, the patient is given an α -blocker, which blocks the α receptors, and then epinephrine is administered to treat the allergic reaction. As a result, the epinephrine causes vasodilation and decreases blood pressure, which is the Vasomotor reversal of Dale Reference: Essentials of Medical Pharmacology- K.D Tripathi, 8th Edition, Page 143.",

      "correct_answer": "D",
      "explanation": "Correct answer: D ) 1, 2 and 3 Explanation: Postural hypotension (1): Due to α 1B receptor blockade in vascular smooth muscle → vasodilation → sudden drop in BP on standing (first-dose effect). Retrograde ejaculation (2): α 1A blockade at the internal urethral sphincter → sphincter fails to close during ejaculation → semen flows backward into the bladder. Floppy iris syndrome (3): α 1 receptor blockade in iris dilator muscle → leads to poor pupil dilation and billowing of the iris during eye surgery (noted especially in patients undergoing cataract surgery). Reflex bradycardia (4): Incorrect : Prazosin typically causes reflex tachycardia , not bradycardia. When vasodilation causes a fall in BP, baroreceptor reflexes increase sympathetic output → tachycardia . Bradycardia is more common with drugs that increase vagal tone (e.g., clonidine, β -blockers).

      "explanation": "Correct Answer: C) Pindolol Explanation: Pindolol is a potent, non-selective beta blocker with Intrinsic sympathomimetic activity Membrane stabilizing property Lower risk for rebound hypertension when medication is stopped As it has a sympathetic activity, it does not cause bradycardia; thus, it is safe for cardiovascular conditions It also blocks sodium channels on the heart muscle’s membrane, hence exhibiting a membrane stabilizing action, and thus, it can be used in Atrial fibrillation Ventricular fibrillation It also blocks sodium channels in neurons, leading to decreased nerve conduction. Non selective I 1 + I 2 blocker Cardioselective I 1 blocker Without ISA With ISA With I blocking activity Metoprolol (Option B) Esmolol Atenolol Bisoprolol Acebutolol Betaxolol Nebivolol Propranolol (Option D) Sotalol Timolol Pindolol Celiprolol Oxprenolol Penbutolol Pindolol Bopindolol Labetalol Carvedilol (Option A) ISA: intrinsic sympathomimetic action Beta-blockers with membrane stabilizing activity (MSA) are: Propranolol (Maximum MSA) Metoprolol Sotalol Labetalol Acebutolol Pindolol Carvedilol (Option A): It has multiple mechanisms of action, namely, I 1 + I 2 + I 1 blockade and Calcium channel blocker. It is used as a cardioprotective agent in congestive cardiac failure. Metoprolol (Option B): It is the prototype cardioselective I 1 blocker, which may be used in diabetic patients receiving oral hypoglycemia (beta blockers are usually contraindicated). It is also used in people intolerant to propranolol, which causes cold hands and feet. Propranolol (Option D): It is a non-selective beta blocker without intrinsic sympathomimetic activity, and membrane stabilizing property is present only at high doses.

A non-dihydropyridine calcium channel blocker (i.e., diltiazem , verapamil ) should not be simultaneously prescribed with a beta blocker since both classes have negative inotropic and chronotropic effects and can lead to bradycardia and heart block. Dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers (e.g., Nifedipine, Nimodipine, and Amlodipine), when added to beta-blockers, increase heart rate and decrease blood pressure, resulting in an augmented symptom benefit compared with either drug class alone.

Prolonged propranolol therapy may impair carbohydrate tolerance in prediabetics by decreasing insulin release, leading to hyperglycemia and diabetes. In diabetics, propranolol is avoided because of the risk of hypoglycemic episodes, as glycogenolysis in the heart, skeletal muscles, and liver that occurs due to sympathetic stimulation is attenuated. In diabetic patients, beta blockers mask the signs of hypoglycemia mediated through sympathetic stimulation (tachycardia, tremor, palpitations) (Option A, B, C ruled out) .
