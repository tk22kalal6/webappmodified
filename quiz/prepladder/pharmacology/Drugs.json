      "question": "A 62-year-old woman is brought to the emergency department because of acute chest pain with complaints of diaphoresis and lightheadedness. An ECG reveals ST-segment elevation in the inferior leads. Her blood pressure is 90/60 mm Hg, and her pulse is 42/min. The appropriate therapy is initiated, including medication to treat her bradycardia. The medication improved her vitals, but she now complains of severe right eye pain. Which of the following drugs can be used to treat this patient?",
      "options": {
        "A": "Phenylephrine",
        "B": "Pyridostigmine",
        "C": "Pilocarpine",
        "D": "Bethanechol"
      },
      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: C) Pilocarpine Explanation: Given the clinical scenario, this patient had an inferior wall MI associated with bradycardia. Atropine , an antimuscarinic drug, blocks vagal effects on the nodes of the heart, effectively increasing heart rate. In the eye, it induces mydriasis, which narrows the anterior chamber angle and reduces aqueous humor outflow, potentially triggering acute angle-closure glaucoma. The drug of choice for this condition is pilocarpine . When applied topically to the eye, pilocarpine rapidly penetrates the cornea, causing miosis, ciliary muscle contraction, and reduced intraocular pressure. Therapeutic uses of pilocarpine: Third-line treatment for open-angle glaucoma, either alone or in combination with other medications. Counteracting the effects of mydriatics and preventing or breaking adhesions of the iris with the lens or cornea. Treating xerostomia (dry mouth) associated with Sjögren's syndrome or following head and neck radiation therapy. Side effects: Topical use: Stinging, accommodation spasm, and systemic effects such as nausea, diarrhea, and bronchospasm at higher doses. Pilocarpine is associated with cataract formation after chronic use. Systemic use: Cholinergic effects like sweating, nausea, and diarrhea. Phenylephrine ( Option A) is used as a mydriatic and nasal decongestant. Pyridostigmine (Option B) is used to treat myasthenia gravis. Bethanechol (Option D) is used to treat urinary retention and stimulate bladder function.

        "A": "Glycopyrrolate",
        "B": "Neostigmine",
        "C": "Pilocarpine",
        "D": "Bethanechol"
      },
      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: A) Glycopyrrolate Explanation: Glycopyrrolate is a muscarinic antagonist that reduces salivary secretions. Glycopyrrolate is frequently used in pre-anesthetic medication and during surgery. Glycopyrrolate : Glycopyrrolate is a potent and rapidly acting antimuscarinic drug that lacks central effects. MOA : Works by blocking muscarinic receptors and inhibits the effects of acetylcholine. Uses : Pre-anesthetic medication and during anesthesia - to reduce salivary and tracheobronchial secretions. Reduce drooling - Parkinson’s disease. Reduce GI tone and motility. Treat primary axillary hyperhidrosis. Treat obstructive airway disease. Adverse Effects : Dry mouth, Constipation, Blurred vision, Gastrointestinal discomfort, Cognitive impairment. Neostigmine (Option B) is a cholinergic agonist that increases salivary secretions, worsening the patient’s drooling. Pilocarpine (Option C) is a cholinergic agonist that increases salivary secretions. It is used to treat xerostomia (dry mouth) Bethanechol (Option D) is a cholinergic agonist that increases salivary secretions. It is primarily used to treat urinary retention.

        "B": "Atropine",
        "C": "Carbachol",
        "D": "Scopolamine"
      },
      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: C) Carbachol Explanation: Carbachol is a cholinergic agonist that acts on both muscarinic and nicotinic receptors. When applied topically to the eye, carbachol produces miosis (pupillary constriction) and facilitates aqueous outflow, reducing intraocular pressure. Carbachol : Carbachol is a cholinergic agonist, that acts by directly stimulating cholinergic receptors. It is a long-acting drug that is resistant to degradation by acetylcholinesterase and butyrylcholinesterase. Uses : Glaucoma, causes the ciliary muscle to contract, reducing intraocular pressure. Side effects : DUMBBELSS = Diarrhea, Urination, Miosis, Bronchospasm, Bradycardia, Excitation/seizures, Lacrimation, Salivation, and Sweating. Ipratropium (Option A): is a muscarinic antagonist that acts selectively on bronchial muscles. Atropine and scopolamine (Options B & D): are muscarinic receptor antagonists. They produce mydriasis (pupillary dilation), which can worsen angle closure and increase intraocular pressure.

      "question": "A 68 y/o woman with a long history of diabetes presents with complaints of frequent urinary tract infections and difficulty emptying her bladder. She reports feeling like she needs to urinate urgently, but when she tries to go, very little urine comes out. After ruling out a urinary tract obstruction, which medication would be most appropriate to address her symptoms?",
      "options": {
        "A": "Bethanechol",
        "B": "Pilocarpine",
        "C": "Atropine",
        "D": "Edrophonium"
      },
      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: A) Bethanechol Explanation: This patient, with a long history of diabetes and urinary symptoms, is most likely to have a neurogenic bladder, causing inadequate bladder emptying. Bethanechol is the most appropriate medication for this patient's neurogenic bladder. Bethanechol : Bethanechol is a cholinergic agonist that stimulates muscarinic receptors, which are found primarily in the urinary and gastrointestinal tracts. MOA : Mimics the effects of acetylcholine, which plays a crucial role in the parasympathetic nervous system, at muscarinic receptors. Upon stimulating muscarinic receptors, it promotes bladder muscle contraction, aiding in urine expulsion and reducing urinary retention. Clinical Usage: Postoperative and Postpartum urinary retention with no actual obstruction. Neurogenic bladder. Symptomatic relief in congenital megacolon. Gastroesophageal reflux (Rare, due to its side effects). Side Effects: Gastrointestinal: Belching, involuntary defecation. Urinary: Involuntary urination. Other: Flushing, sweating, hypotension. Contraindications : Mechanical obstruction of the gastrointestinal or urinary tract. Asthma. Hypotension. Pilocarpine (Option B): While pilocarpine is a muscarinic agonist, it's clinically used in topical applications for glaucoma and xerostomia (dry mouth). Atropine (Option C): is a muscarinic receptor antagonist, working in direct opposition to bethanechol. Edrophonium (Option D): s hort-acting cholinesterase inhibitor, is primarily utilized in diagnosing myasthenia gravis.

      },
      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "edrophonium Correct Answer: C) Temporary improvement in muscle strength after administration of edrophonium which present with similar symptoms but require opposite treatments. Myasthenic crisis arises from inadequate acetylcholine at the neuromuscular junction. The cholinergic crisis results from excessive acetylcholine stimulation due to anticholinesterase medication overdose. The tensilon test involves the injection of 10 mg i.v. Edrophonium, a short-acting anticholinesterase agent. Steps: 2 mg i.v. Edrophonium → Observe for any adverse reactions → If no adverse reactions occur after 30–60 seconds, the remaining 8 mg is injected. Results: Myasthenia Gravis: Short-lasting improvement in muscle strength. Other Muscular Dystrophies: No improvement. (Option A ruled out) Cholinergic crisis: No improvement or a worsening of their condition. (Option B ruled out) Alternative Test: If edrophonium is unavailable,1.5 mg of i.v. Neostigmine can be used alternatively. Atropine pretreatment can be administered to counteract the muscarinic effects of neostigmine. Provocative test (d-Tubocurarine test): Myasthenia gravis patients are highly sensitive to d-tubocurarine (a non-depolarising muscle blocker ); a 0.5 mg IV dose causes significant weakness in them but does not affect non-myasthenic individuals. However, this test is hazardous and not commonly performed.

        "C": "IV-Ig",
        "D": "Atropine"
      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: B) Pyridostigmine Explanation: Based on the scenario, the likely diagnosis is Myasthenia gravis, which is managed with Pyridostigmine, neostigmine, and ambenonium. They are anti-cholinesterase agents that inhibit the breakdown of ACh by acetylcholinesterase and increase presynaptic levels of ACh, allowing for muscle contraction. Edrophonium (Option A): short-acting acetylcholinesterase inhibitor, is used as a diagnostic tool in suspected cases of myasthenia gravis. This involves intravenous administration to individuals with a deficiency of acetylcholine receptors at the neuromuscular junction. The test typically results in a temporary improvement in muscle strength, confirming the diagnosis of myasthenia gravis by demonstrating the underlying defect in neuromuscular transmission. IV- Ig (Option C): or intravenous immunoglobulins are used for exacerbations known as myasthenic crisis. Atropine ( Option D): is an anticholinergic drug given along with pyridostigmine to counteract the cholinergic side effects of pyridostigmine.

      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: B) Neostigmine Explanation: Neostigmine is a carbamate drug that cannot cross the blood-brain barrier because it is a quaternary amine, which makes it more polar and less able to penetrate the lipid-rich environment of the BBB. On the other hand, Physostigmine, donepezil and Rivastigmine (Options A, C & D) are tertiary amines, allowing them to cross the BBB and exert their effects within the central nervous system.

        "D": "Galantamine"
      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: B) Donepezil Explanation: Donepezil is a cholinesterase inhibitor commonly used as a first-line treatment for managing symptoms of mild to moderate Alzheimer's disease. It works by increasing the levels of acetylcholine in the brain, which can help improve cognitive function and slow the progression of symptoms. Side effects: Nasopharyngitis, diarrhoea, nausea, and vomiting, which are linked to an overabundance of peripheral cholinergic stimulation. In rare cases, rhabdomyolysis has been reported, necessitating discontinuation of the medication. Rivastigmine (Options C) and Galantamine (Options D) are also cholinesterase inhibitors and can be used, but Donepezil is often preferred due to its once-daily dosing and favourable side-effect profile. Memantine ( Option A) , on the other hand, is typically used for moderate to severe Alzheimer's disease and works differently as an NMDA receptor antagonist.

        "A": "Sarin",
        "B": "Malathion",
        "C": "Tabun",
        "D": "Tacrine"
      },
      "correct_answer": "D",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: D) Tacrine Explanation: Tacrine is a reversible acetylcholinesterase (AChE) inhibitor used primarily in the symptomatic treatment of Alzheimer's disease. It functions by binding reversibly to the active site of AChE, thereby inhibiting the enzyme's ability to hydrolyze acetylcholine (ACh). This increases ACh levels in the synaptic cleft, enhancing cholinergic neurotransmission in the central nervous system, which is deficient in Alzheimer’s disease. Mechanism of Reversible Anticholinesterases: Reversible AChE inhibitors, such as tacrine, bind non-covalently to AChE, allowing their effects to dissipate as the drug is metabolized or cleared from the body. These agents are categorized as short-acting (e.g., edrophonium) or intermediate-acting (e.g., tacrine, donepezil). Tacrine’s reversible inhibition enhances cholinergic function in the brain, temporarily improving cognitive symptoms in Alzheimer’s disease. In contrast, irreversible inhibitors like organophosphates (e.g., sarin, tabun, malathion) form stable, covalent bonds with AChE, leading to prolonged enzyme inactivation. Therapeutic Applications: Alzheimer’s Disease: Tacrine enhances cholinergic transmission in the central nervous system, improving cognitive function in early-to-moderate Alzheimer’s disease. However, its use is limited by hepatotoxicity and the need for frequent dosing due to its short half-life. Myasthenia Gravis: Other reversible AChE inhibitors (e.g., pyridostigmine, neostigmine) are used to increase ACh availability at the neuromuscular junction, improving muscle strength. Tacrine is not typically used for this condition. Side Effects: Gastrointestinal: Nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and abdominal cramps due to increased parasympathetic activity. Cardiovascular: Bradycardia Sarin (Option A) and Tabun (Option C) are organophosphate nerve agents that act as irreversible AChE inhibitors. They form a covalent bond with the enzyme, leading to prolonged inhibition that requires new enzyme synthesis for recovery. Malathion (Option B) is an organophosphate pesticide that also irreversibly inhibits AChE, primarily used in agricultural settings, not for therapeutic purposes.",

      },
      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: C) To identify airway hyperreactivity consistent with asthma Explanation: The methacholine challenge test is used to assess airway hypersensitivity, which is a hallmark of asthma. Methacholine is a synthetic choline ester that acts as a muscarinic agonist. The methacholine challenge test involves administering nebulised methacholine in increasing concentrations to the patient and measuring the resulting changes in lung function. A positive test is indicated by a 20% decrease in FEV1 (PC20) at a concentration ≤ 4 mg/mL, suggesting asthma. Intermediate results (PC20 between 4-16 mg/mL) indicate mild hyperreactivity, A PC20 > 16 mg/mL is negative. A negative test can help rule out asthma but should be interpreted cautiously if the patient has relevant symptoms. Contraindications to methacholine testing: Severe airflow limitation, recent MI or stroke, uncontrolled hypertension, or pregnancy. COPD is typically diagnosed through clinical history, risk factors (like smoking), and spirometry showing irreversible airflow obstruction. (Option A ruled out) Pulmonary embolism is diagnosed using imaging studies such as a CT pulmonary angiogram or V/Q scan and blood tests like D-dimer. (Option B ruled out) Restrictive lung diseases are characterised by reduced lung volumes and are diagnosed through spirometry, which shows decreased total lung capacity (TLC) and other lung volume measurements.

      "explanation": "Correct Answer: D) Atropine Explanation: Organophosphate poisoning Common exposures Pesticide: farmer/field worker, pediatric ingestion, suicide attempt Nerve agent: multiple patients presenting with similar symptoms Manifestations Muscarinic (DUMBBELSS) : D- Diarrhea U- Urination M- Miosis B- Bronchospasms, bronchorrhea, bradycardia E- Excitation, Emesis L- Lacrimation S- Salivation, sweating Nicotinic: Muscle weakness, paralysis, fasciculations. Management Decontamination Atropine reverses muscarinic symptoms Pralidoxime reverses nicotinic and muscarinic symptoms (reactivates cholinesterase) This patient developed bradycardia, tachypnea, and excessive salivation after exposure to a pesticide, indicating acute organophosphate toxicity. Here are the key points: Mechanism : Organophosphates are irreversible acetylcholinesterase inhibitors causing cholinergic excess by overstimulating muscarinic (DUMBBELSS) and nicotinic receptors (muscle weakness, fasciculations, paralysis). Initial Management: Atropine (option D) : Administered first. Competitive inhibitor of acetylcholine at the muscarinic receptor. Resolves muscarinic symptoms (e.g., bradycardia, salivation). Pralidoxime (Option B): Administer after atropine. Cholinesterase-reactivating agent addressing both muscarinic and nicotinic effects. Given post-atropine, as it can cause transient acetylcholinesterase inhibition, momentarily worsening symptoms. Neostigmine (Option A) , another acetylcholinesterase inhibitor used to treat myasthenia gravis, would worsen this patient's cholinergic symptoms. Naloxone (Option C) is used to treat opioid intoxication, which causes sedation and miosis, but typically suppresses the respiratory rate rather than increasing it. Opioid intoxication usually results from injection or ingestion, not from contact with aerosolised agents.

      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: C) Rocuronium Explanation: Rocuronium is not metabolised by pseudocholinesterase. Given the clinical scenario, the patient probably has pseudocholinesterase deficiency. Anesthetic drugs metabolised by pseudocholinesterase (also known as butyrylcholinesterase) include: Succinylcholine (Option B) : A depolarising muscle relaxant for rapid sequence intubation and short surgical procedures. Pseudocholinesterase deficiency can lead to prolonged paralysis. Mivacurium (Option A) : A short-acting, non-depolarizing muscle relaxant. Like succinylcholine, its metabolism depends on pseudocholinesterase, and deficiency can result in prolonged effects. Patients with pseudocholinesterase deficiency should avoid these drugs to prevent prolonged paralysis and other complications. Other nondepolarising neuromuscular blockers, such as atracurium, rocuronium, and vecuronium, are safe for use. These drugs are primarily eliminated through hepatic metabolism and excreted via bile and urine. Their action and duration are not dependent on pseudocholinesterase activity, making them suitable muscle relaxants for patients with this enzyme deficiency.

      "explanation": "Correct Answer: C) Pilocarpine Explanation: After undergoing radiation therapy for her head and neck, this 45-year-old woman is now complaining of xerostomia. One popular medication used to promote salivation is pilocarpine. Muscarinic cholinergic receptor agonists can be classified into two types: The naturally occurring cholinomimetic alkaloids/ amides (including pilocarpine, muscarine, and arecoline) and their synthetic congeners Choline esters, including ACh and many synthetic esters Amides/Alkaloids Clinical significance Pilocarpine (Option C) Pilocarpine hydrochloride is used to treat xerostomia that develops after head and neck radiation treatments or that is linked to Sjögren syndrome and impairs their ability to secrete secretions (saliva and lacrimal), used for treatment of angle closure glaucoma. Cevimeline Cevimeline primarily stimulates the M1 and M3 receptors. Compared to pilocarpine, cevimeline may have fewer adverse effects and a long-lasting sialogogic impact on the salivary and lacrimal glands. Choline esters Clinical significance Acetylcholine ACh is used topically as a 1% solution into the eye to induce miosis during surgery, while it is rarely administered systemically. Methacholine (Option D) Inhaling methacholine can diagnose bronchial airway hyperreactivity in patients without asthma symptoms. Bethanechol (Option B) GI and urinary tracts are the main organs affected by bethanechol. Bethanechol is useful for treating postop urine retention, diabetic autonomic neuropathy, and other chronic hypotonic, myogenic, or neurogenic bladder conditions when the organic blockage is absent. It can also be used to treat insufficient bladder emptying. Carbachol (Option A) Carbachol is injected into the eye as a 0.01% to 3% solution and is used topically in ophthalmology to treat glaucoma and induce miosis during surgery.

      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: A) Bethanechol - Direct-acting cholinergic agonist Explanation: Following abdominal surgery, the 60-year-old male patient is complaining of urinary retention. A cholinergic agonist with direct action, Bethanechol, is a treatment for urinary retention. Cholinergic drugs can be generally divided into: 1. Direct acting: Bonds to the muscarinic or nicotinic receptor directly. 2. Indirect acting: Increases acetylcholine (Ach) by blocking acetylcholine esterase. Nicotic agonists are used to treat addiction to smoking. Amides are lipid-soluble and can pass across the blood-brain barrier. They can be used to treat CNS disorders, but they may also cause typical CNS side effects. Because choline esters are lipid insoluble, they cannot pass across the blood-brain barrier. They are used to treat peripheral disorders and have no central side effects. Neostigmine (Option B) is an indirect-acting cholinergic agonist (not anticholinergic) as it inhibits acetylcholinesterase, thereby increasing acetylcholine levels at the synapse. Atropine (Option C) is a direct-acting anticholinergic (muscarinic antagonist), blocking the action of acetylcholine at muscarinic receptors. Pilocarpine (Option D) is a direct-acting cholinergic agonist, not an indirect-acting anticholinergic.",

It is used to treat blepharospasm, achalasia, torticollis, squint, migraine pain, hyperhidrosis, and cosmetic procedures to reduce wrinkles. Botulinum toxin (botox) is derived from Clostridium botulinum, a bacterial toxin. It inhibits the release of acetylcholine (Ach) from nerve endings by blocking calcium channels, specifically calcium-dependent Snare protein, leading to muscle paralysis rather than stimulation.

        "D": "CSII with regular insulin using an insulin pump"
      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: B) A premixed combination of regular and NPH insulin twice daily Explanation; A premixed combination of regular and NPH insulin offers the convenience of twice-daily injections while addressing basal and prandial insulin needs. Mixtard insulin is a pre-mixed combination of regular insulin and isophane insulin. It is used in a split-mixed regimen, where the total daily dose is split and injected twice daily, before breakfast and dinner. Two formulations are available: A 30:70 mixture of regular and isophane insulin and a 50:50 mixture of regular and isophane insulin. Regular insulin has a rapid onset and short duration of action, while isophane insulin has a longer duration of action. PROPERTY INTERMEDIATE-ACTING INSULIN Specific preparation Insulin zinc suspension (Lente insulin), Neutral protamine Hagedorn (NPH) insulin, or isophane insulin Appearance Cloudy solution Onset of action 1-2 hours Peak effect 8-10 hours Effective duration 12-20 hours (Lente), 12-20 hours (NPH) Compatibility Can be mixed with regular insulin Disadvantages The time course of absorption and intensity of action are relatively inconsistent Major adverse effect Hypoglycemia Additional Information Intermediate-acting insulin is formulated to prolong insulin absorption. It is often combined with regular insulin in a split-mixed regimen, subcutaneously twice daily, before breakfast and dinner. Lente - Insulin zinc suspension. NPH insulin is formulated by adding protamine to insulin in a quantity just sufficient to complex all the insulin molecules at a neutral pH. Insulin glargine once daily (Option A) provides only basal insulin coverage and would necessitate additional injections of rapid-acting insulin before meals, making it less convenient. Insulin aspart before each meal (Option C) only addresses mealtime glucose control and lacks basal coverage. While effective, CSII (Option D) is more complex, requiring significant patient education and adherence.

        "D": "Somogyi effect"
      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: B) Lipoatrophy caused by older insulin preparations Explanation: This is a clinical scenario involving lipodystrophy, specifically lipoatrophy , as a potential side effect of long-term exogenous insulin use. Lipoatrophy is characterised by the loss of subcutaneous fat, most commonly observed at the site of repeated insulin injections. Older insulin preparations were more frequently associated with lipoatrophy as a side effect. The use of human insulin and highly purified insulin analogues has significantly reduced the occurrence of lipoatrophy. Lipohypertrophy (Option C) involves an increase in subcutaneous fat at the injection site and is thought to be caused by the local lipogenic effects of high insulin concentrations. Somogyi effect (Option D) is related to early morning hyperglycemia in diabetes. These conditions are not associated with lipoatrophy. ADVERSE EFFECT DESCRIPTION Hypoglycemia The most frequent and serious reaction to exogenous insulin, especially in labile diabetes. Symptoms: Sweating, anxiety, palpitations, tremors (sympathetic stimulation); dizziness, headache, and behavioural changes (glucose deprivation). Severe cases: mental confusion, seizures, coma (blood glucose < 40 mg/dL). Local Reactions Swelling, erythema, and stinging, especially initially, at the injection site Lipodystrophy Rare; changes to subcutaneous fat at injection site, more common with older insulin. Caused by repetitive injections at the same site. Prevent by changing injection sites regularly. Allergy Very rare with human/purified insulins. Caused by contaminating proteins. Symptoms: Urticaria, angioedema, anaphylaxis. Hypokalemia Insulin moves potassium from the bloodstream into cells, leading to low blood potassium levels Edema Short-lived dependent edema due to sodium retention may occur when starting insulin therapy Weight Gain Modest weight gain with insulin treatment for type 1 and type 2 diabetes Reference: Goodman & Gilman's The Pharmacological Basis of Therapeutics, 14th Edition, Page 1033, KD Tripathi Essentials of Medical Pharmacology, 8th Edition, Page 287",

      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: B) Intravenous infusion of regular insulin Explanation: The most appropriate initial insulin therapy for this patient with diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) is intravenous infusion of regular insulin. Acute complications of diabetes include: Diabetic ketoacidosis/DKA (Type 1 DM): Ketoacidosis of different grades generally occurs in insulin dependent diabetics, and is due to inadequate/no insulin replacement. Typically they are dehydrated, hyperventilating and have impaired consciousness. Hyperosmolar hyperglycemic state/HHS (Type 2 DM): This is characterized by high blood glucose (>600 mg/dl) and serum osmolality (>320 mOsm/L) along with deteriorating mental status. Hyperkalemia Condition Insulin Use Rationale DKA Intravenous (IV) regular insulin is used to correct metabolic abnormalities rapidly. Initial dose: Bolus of 0.1-0.2 U/kg, followed by a continuous infusion of 0.1 U/kg/hour. Adjustment: Double the infusion rate if no significant decrease in blood glucose after 2 hours. Maintenance: Once blood glucose reaches 300 mg/dL, reduce the infusion rate to 2-3 U/hour until consciousness is regained. Regular insulin, the only type used for IV injections, promptly reverses the metabolic consequences of insulin deficiency. This method ensures a rapid blood glucose reduction, allows infusion rate adjustments based on patient response, and prevents hypoglycemia while providing ongoing metabolic support. Hyperkalemia Regular insulin IV is administered along with 50% dextrose This approach helps shift potassium back into cells, lowering serum potassium levels HHS IV Regular insulin is preferred. The general principles of treatment are the same as for ketoacidotic coma, except that faster fluid replacement is to be instituted.

      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: B) Corneal deposits Explanation: Corneal deposits are a recognised ophthalmic side effect of chloroquine therapy for malaria prophylaxis or treatment. These deposits can lead to symptoms such as blurred vision and halos around lights. Optic neuritis, retinal detachment, glaucoma, and macular edema are not typically associated with chloroquine use for malaria. CHLOROQUINE MOA Chloroquine accumulates in acidic compartments of parasite-infected cells, disrupting heme polymerisation and inhibiting parasite growth and replication. Resistance Due to mutations in genes encoding transporters involved in chloroquine uptake and efflux, reducing chloroquine accumulation within parasites.

      "explanation": "Correct Answer: C) Mefloquine Explanation: Mefloquine is contraindicated in patients with a history of psychiatric disorders such as schizophrenia. Mefloquine can exacerbate psychiatric symptoms, potentially leading to severe psychiatric reactions, including anxiety, paranoia, depression, hallucinations, and even suicidal thoughts. The choice of antimalarial drug depends on the species of Plasmodium causing the infection, the severity of the infection, drug resistance patterns in the area, and individual patient factors such as pregnancy and age. ANTI-MALARIAL DRUGS Drug Class Mechanism of Action Drugs & Indications Notes Chloroquine Group Inhibits the conversion of hemoglobin to hemozoin in parasites Chloroquine: Treatment of malaria (clinical cure), lepra reaction, atopic dermatitis Amodiaquine and Piperaquine: Treatment of malaria. Chloroquine can cause ocular toxicity, including bull's eye maculopathy, anterior subcapsular cataracts, and vortex keratopathy. Artemisinin Group Forms free radicals that damage parasite proteins and DNA Artesunate: Treatment of malaria (clinical cure), including complicated malaria (IV administration). Artemether, Arteether, and Arterolane: Treatment of malaria (clinical cure). Artemisinin is obtained from the Chinese herb Artesuna annua . Quinoline Blocks potassium channels in parasites, leading to paralysis Quinine: Treatment of malaria (clinical cure), including complicated malaria (IV administration). Quinidine: Treatment of malaria (clinical cure) and used as a Class IA antiarrhythmic drug. Quinine is obtained from the cinchona plant and can cause ototoxicity (cinchonism), hypoglycemia, QT prolongation, hypotension, and diarrhea. Primaquine Disrupts the parasite's electron transport chain Radical cure of malaria caused by P. vivax and P. ovale (targets hypnozoites). Primaquine is not effective against erythrocytic schizogony and, therefore not used for clinical cure. Antifolates Inhibit dihydrofolate reductase, essential for parasite folate synthesis Pyrimethamine and Sulfadoxine: Treatment of malaria (clinical cure), typically in combination with artesunate. Proguanil: Treatment of malaria (clinical cure) and prophylaxis. Sulfadoxine: Treatment of malaria Typically in combination with artesunate. These drugs should be combined with folinic acid (tetrahydrofolate) to prevent megaloblastic anemia. Antibiotics Various mechanisms targeting parasite protein synthesis Doxycycline: Treatment of malaria (clinical cure and causal prophylaxis), pneumocystis pneumonia (in combination with primaquine). Clindamycin: Treatment of malaria (clinical cure), pneumocystis pneumonia (in combination with primaquine), toxoplasmosis. Doxycycline is C/I in pregnancy and children <8 years old.

Permethrin is the most efficacious and convenient drug for treating scabies. DRUGS FOR SCABIES 5 % Permethrin (1st line) A pyrethroid insecticide that is highly effective, with nearly 100% cure rates in scabies after a single application. Lindane (2nd line) A broad-spectrum insecticide, but less effective than permethrin and has a higher risk of systemic toxicity, particularly in children. Benzyl Benzoate (2nd line) Minimally absorbed through the skin and has low systemic toxicity but can cause neurological symptoms in children. Crotamiton (2nd line) Less prone to cause skin irritation and has low systemic toxicity but has produced lower cure rates in scabies. Sulfur The oldest scabicide but has several disadvantages, including messy application, unpleasant odour, and the need for repeated applications. Dicophane (DDT) Can be absorbed through the skin and cause systemic toxicity, rarely used due to potential side effects and safer alternatives.

      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: C) Praziquantel Explanation: Praziquantel is C/I in ocular cysticercosis as it can trigger an inflammatory response, potentially leading to vision loss. PRAZIQUANTEL MOA Causes calcium ion influx into the tapeworm, resulting in paralysis, detachment from the intestine, and death. At higher concentrations, it breaks down the tapeworm's outer layer. Pharmacokinetics Extensively metabolised in the liver ( ⇒ less bioavailability) Uses Highly effective for all human tapeworm infections, especially for T. solium cysticercosis, where larvae invade tissues like the muscles, and skin. Adverse effects In neurocysticercosis, killing larval cysts in the brain can trigger inflammation, leading to seizures and I intracranial pressure. C/I in ocular cysticercosis due to the risk of intense inflammatory response, tissue damage, and vision loss Levamisole (Option A) Levamisole is an antiparasitic drug that is primarily used to treat ascariasis (2nd line drug) and ancylostomiasis.

Correct Answer: C) More fermentable the laxative, the more the stool bulk and faster the transit. behind this is that poorly fermentable fibres (Lignin, Cellulose) absorb more water, resulting in more stool volume. Fibre is that part of food that resists enzymatic digestion and reaches the colon largely unchanged. Colonic bacteria ferment fibre to varying degrees, depending on its chemical nature and water solubility. Fermentation of fibre has two important effects: It produces short-chain fatty acids , which are trophic for colonic epithelium and have a prokinetic effect. It increases bacterial mass, which results in increased stool volume. Fibers have varying degrees of fermentation, which is summarised in the table:- Bulk Laxatives such as Bran, Psyllium husk, & Methylcellulose contain more Lignin, which aids in their effectiveness. Fruits and vegetables contain more pectins and hemicellulose, which is readily fermentable, and has a reduced effect on increasing stool volume. Fermentation produces SCFAs and bacterial mass (Option A) : Correct . This is true and contributes to motility. SCFAs are prokinetic, and bacteria increase stool mass (Option B) : Correct . SCFAs enhance colonic motility; increased bacterial biomass adds to bulk. Lignin resists fermentation; pectins are fermented (Option D) : Correct . This accurately describes fiber fermentability.",

This condition is a known side effect of metoclopramide, especially in younger patients. Metoclopramide is a dopamine (D2) antagonist, and it is used for nausea, vomiting, and gastroparesis but carries a risk of extrapyramidal symptoms since it significantly crosses BBB (Blood blood-brain barrier). In contrast, domperidone , another (D2) antagonist, has a lower risk of causing extrapyramidal symptoms because it does not cross the BBB as readily as metoclopramide. Therefore, domperidone is often preferred in patients who are at higher risk for these side effects.

Explanation: Hepatic encephalopathy (HE) is a neuropsychiatric syndrome resulting from liver dysfunction and portosystemic shunting, leading to the accumulation of neurotoxins such as ammonia. Elevated ammonia levels contribute significantly to the pathogenesis of HE. Lactulose is a non-absorbable disaccharide used in the management of HE. Its primary mechanism involves: Lactulose is metabolized by colonic bacteria to lactic acid and acetic acid, leading to a decrease in colonic pH. The acidic environment converts ammonia (NH3) to ammonium (NH4+), which is not readily absorbed by the gut. This conversion reduces the overall absorption of ammonia into the bloodstream, thereby lowering serum ammonia levels and improving symptoms of HE.
