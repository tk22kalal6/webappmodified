      "question": "A 45 y/o male presents with fatigue, unintentional weight loss, and left upper quadrant abdominal discomfort. Physical examination shows splenomegaly. Lab tests show leukocytosis. The peripheral blood smear shows increased basophils, myelocytes, and segmented neutrophils. Bone marrow biopsy confirms hypercellularity with increased myeloid precursors and the presence of the Philadelphia chromosome (BCR-ABL fusion gene). Which of the following drugs would be your DOC to treat the patient?",

      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: B) Imatinib Explanation: The clinical scenario given, describes a patient who has CML. Chronic Myeloid Leukemia (CML) is a myeloproliferative disorder characterized by the presence of the Philadelphia chromosome, resulting from a reciprocal translocation between chromosomes 9 and 22 [t(9;22)(q34;q11)], which generates the BCR-ABL fusion gene. This fusion gene encodes a constitutively active tyrosine kinase that drives the uncontrolled proliferation of myeloid cells Imatinib binds to the ABL kinase portion of the BCR-ABL tyrosine kinase receptor, inhibiting its attachment and preventing cell division. By inhibiting this aberrant tyrosine kinase activity, Imatinib selectively targets the underlying cause of CML, leading to inhibition of leukemic cell proliferation and induction of apoptosis. Ponatinib (Option A), Nilotinib (Option C) & Dasatinib (Option D) , and Bosutinib can also be used for treating CML but neither of them is DOC for CML. Dasatinib and Nilotinib are used in Imatinib-resistant cases. Ponatinib is used in Dasatinib and Nilotinib-resistant cases. In further resistant cases, Omacetaxine.

      "question": "A 60-year-old female patient diagnosed with a gastrointestinal stromal tumor (GIST) has been started on first-line treatment. Genetic testing reveals a mutation in the c-KIT gene. After several months, the patient develops resistance to the initial therapy. The oncologist considers alternative medications.

      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: C) Ripretinib Explanation: Ripretinib is a switch-control tyrosine kinase inhibitor developed for use in GIST , particularly after resistance to other TKIs. It selectively targets mutant forms of KIT and PDGFR α , offering improved inhibition of a wide spectrum of mutations, but with more specificity for PDGFR compared to multikinase inhibitors like sunitinib and regorafenib. It is used as fourth-line treatment in GIST after failure of imatinib, sunitinib, and regorafenib.

Hodgkin's lymphoma , however, is not a B-cell receptor–driven malignancy and thus not commonly treated with BTK inhibitors. Standard treatment for Hodgkin’s lymphoma includes chemotherapy (e.g., ABVD regimen) and immunotherapy (e.g., anti-CD30 antibodies like Brentuximab vedotin), not BTK inhibitors .

      "question": "A 52-year-old female presents with a diagnosis of invasive ductal carcinoma of the breast. The tumour measures 3 cm in diameter and has been staged as T2N1M0.

        "D": "Bevacizumab"
      },
      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: C) Trastuzumab Explanation: Trastuzumab (Option C) is a monoclonal antibody targeting the HER2 protein, which is overexpressed in HER2-positive breast cancers. This patient has HER2 +ve, ER -ve stage II breast cancer. It binds to the extracellular domain IV of HER2, reduces HER2 signaling, and can induce antibody-dependent, immune cell-mediated cytotoxicity, inhibiting cancer cell proliferation. It is specifically used to treat HER2-positive breast cancer, both in early-stage and metastatic settings. Tamoxifen (Option A): A selective estrogen receptor modulator (SERM), binds to estrogen receptors on breast cancer cells, thereby blocking the effects of estrogen, which can promote the growth of breast cancer cells. It is primarily used for estrogen receptor-positive (ER+) breast cancer. Cetuximab (Option B) : It is a monoclonal antibody that targets the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and thus prevents cell proliferation. It treats certain types of colorectal and head and neck cancers that overexpress EGFR rather than HER2. Bevacizumab (Option D): It is a monoclonal antibody that targets vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), inhibiting angiogenesis. It is used for metastatic colorectal cancer, non-small cell lung cancer, renal cell carcinoma, and glioblastoma. It is not usually associated with the treatment of HER2 +ve breast cancer.

A Chest CT reveals a suspicious mass in the right upper lobe. A biopsy of the mass shows adenocarcinoma. Further molecular testing reveals high PD-L1 expression (>50%) and no actionable mutations in EGFR, ALK, or ROS1.

        "D": "Ipilimumab"
      },
      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: C) Pembrolizumab Explanation: Pembrolizumab is an immune checkpoint inhibitor that targets the PD-1 receptor on T-cells. The patient's symptoms, CT findings, molecular testing, and biopsy tests of adenocarcinoma (the most common subtype of NSCLC) results are typical presentations for a patient with non-small cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC). Here, the patient has high PD-L1 expression (>50%). Pembrolizumab is particularly effective in NSCLC patients with high PD-L1 expression ( ≥ 50%) and is approved as a first-line treatment for these patients when there are no actionable mutations in EGFR, ALK, or ROS1. MOA of Immune Checkpoint Inhibitors: Erlotinib (Option A): It is a tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) that targets the EGFR. These mutations are more common in non-smokers. Bevacizumab (Option B): It is a monoclonal antibody that inhibits VEGF, thereby inhibiting angiogenesis. It is used in combination with chemotherapy for certain types of cancer, including NSCLC. Ipilimumab (Option D) : It is a CTLA-4 inhibitor. By blocking CTLA-4, ipilimumab enhances T-cell activation and proliferation, promoting an immune response against cancer cells.

      "correct_answer": "D",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: D) Mogamulizumab Explanation: This patient’s clinical findings are characteristic of Plaque psoriasis. Mogamulizumab is unsuitable for treating plaque psoriasis. Mogamulizumab : It is a monoclonal antibody that targets CCR4, which is expressed on certain T-cells, including malignant T-cells in cutaneous T-cell lymphoma (CTCL), where it is used as a primary agent for treatment. It is mainly used as a treatment for relapsed mycosis fungoides & Sezary syndrome. Mogamulizumab is unsuitable for treating plaque psoriasis because it does not target the mechanisms underlying psoriasis inflammation, such as TNF-alpha or IL-17A. Ixekizumab (Option A) & Secukinumab (Option B) are monoclonal antibodies that specifically target interleukin-17A (IL-17A), a pro-inflammatory cytokine involved in the pathogenesis of psoriasis. They are indicated for treating moderate to severe plaque psoriasis in adults. Etanercept (Option C) is a soluble TNF-alpha receptor fusion protein that binds to and neutralizes TNF-alpha, a key cytokine involved in the inflammatory process in psoriasis. It is indicated for treating moderate to severe plaque psoriasis, psoriatic arthritis, and other autoimmune conditions.

        "D": "Direct cytotoxicity against tumor cells"
      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: B) Activation of T cells Explanation: Aldesleukin (IL-2) stimulates the proliferation of activated T cells and the secretion of cytokines from NK cells and monocytes. IL-2 stimulation increases cytotoxic killing by T cells and NK cells. In the context of renal cell carcinoma (RCC), it enhances immune responses against tumour cells, leading to their destruction. Other Interleukin used in cancer: Denileukin Diftitox is an IL2 linked with diphtheria toxin and is used in cutaneous T-cell lymphomas. Induction of angiogenesis (Option A) : Aldesleukin does not induce angiogenesis; rather, it enhances the immune response against tumours. Inhibition of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) (Option C) : Aldesleukin does not directly inhibit VEGF. Direct cytotoxicity against tumour cells (Option D) : Aldesleukin primarily works through immune-mediated mechanisms rather than direct cytotoxic effects.
