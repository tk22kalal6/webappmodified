      },
      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: A) Inhibits the production of sorbitol Explanation: Epalrestat acts by reducing the production of sorbitol. It inhibits the enzyme aldose reductase , which is involved in the production of sorbitol. Accumulation of sorbitol in tissues, especially in nervous tissue, is the main pathophysiology behind the occurrence of neuropathy in diabetes. Diabetic neuropathy: It occurs due to microvascular injury involving the vasa nervosum (vessels that supply the nerves). Management: Anticonvulsants: Carbamazepine, topiramate. Neurotrophic agents: Pregabalin, gabapentin. Antidepressants: Duloxetine, amitriptyline, nortriptyline. Antiarrhythmic: Mexiletine. Aldose reductase inhibitor: Epalrestat. Drugs that improve insulin sensitivity, like PPAR-gamma agonists increase the expression of GLUT-4 receptors. ( Option B) Pramlintide ( Option C) is an amylin analogue that acts on the corresponding receptors in the brain to reduce glucagon secretion from the pancreatic alpha cells. Metformin acts by stimulating the enzyme ATP-dependant protein kinase. (Option D) Reference: KD Tripathi Essentials of Pharmacology, 8th Edition, Page 300",

      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: C) Indapamide Explanation: Indapamide (thiazide diuretic) will not be used to manage diabetes mellitus. Thiazide diuretics act by decreasing sodium reabsorption in the kidneys but will cause hyperglycemia and hyperuricemia . Hence, these drugs should not be used in patients with diabetes mellitus Colesevelam (Option A) is a farnesoid X receptor antagonist , which is a bile acid binding resin. It helps in lowering blood cholesterol & blood sugar levels. Bromocriptine (Option B) is a dopamine agonist which acts by hypothalamic control of hormones like GH & ACTH, thus reducing insulin resistance. Telmisartan (Option D) is an angiotensin receptor blocker with partial PPAR-gamma agonist activity , hence improves insulin resistance by acting on the adipose tissue and skeletal muscle.

      "explanation": "Correct Answer: B) Empagliflozin Explanation: Diabetic patients with heart failure best benefit from adding a group of drugs called SGLT-2 (sodium-glucose cotransporter-2) inhibitors, and empagliflozin falls in this group. By inhibiting the SGLT-2 receptors in the proximal tubule of the kidneys , glucose (and sodium) reabsorption can be prevented. Since both sodium and glucose are osmotic molecules, increasing their excretion draws out more water, making these drugs effective in patients with heart failure. Drugs: Dapagliflozin. Empagliflozin.

      },
      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: A ) These drugs act by sensitizing skeletal muscles to insulin Explanation: PPAR-gamma agonists/thiazolidinediones act on the PPAR (peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor) gamma in skeletal muscle and adipose tissue , sensitizing them to insulin and reducing blood glucose levels (primary action). Activated PPAR-gamma receptors enhance the expression of insulin-dependent glucose transporter GLUT-4 in adipose tissue and skeletal muscle. Secondary actions: Suppressing hepatic gluconeogenesis. Reduces fatty acid release. Promotes lipogenesis. Drugs: Pioglitazone (available in India). Metabolised by CYP2C8 and CYP3A4. Given only in type 2 diabetes mellitus. Side effects: Plasma volume expansion, oedema, weight gain, headache, myalgia, mild anaemia, and increased risk of fractures (especially in elderly women). C/I: Liver disease and CHF. Troglitazone (banned due to hepatotoxicity). Rosiglitazone (banned due to increased risk of MI/heart failure). Adiponectin (Option B) is released by the adipose tissue, enhancing insulin sensitivity. Gemfibrozil (Option C) impairs the metabolism of these drugs, leading to potential toxicity; hence dose of the latter should be reduced almost to half. Rifampicin does the opposite by inducing the metabolism of these drugs. Activating PPAR-gamma receptors in bones will lead to osteoclastic activation , resulting in bone resorption. Thus, these drugs can cause fractures, especially in those with osteoporosis (Option D) .

        "D": "Negligible risk to administer in patients with kidney disease"
      },
      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: A) Inhibits breakdown of complex carbohydrates Explanation: Alpha-glucosidase inhibitors inhibit breakdown of complex carbohydrates , by inhibiting the enzyme alpha-glucosidase. Alpha-glucosidase is an enzyme present in the brush border of the small intestine. It breaks down complex carbohydrates and enhances the absorption of the resulting simple carbohydrates. Hence, blood glucose levels can be controlled primarily by inhibiting this enzyme. Since complex carbohydrates are made available to the gut after a meal, these drugs help control postprandial hyperglycemia. Drugs: Acarbose, Voglibose, and Miglitol. Weight gain is one of the common side effects (Option B) is an incorrect statement, as these drugs are weight and lipid-level neutral. Acarbose enhances the absorption of digoxin leading to toxicity (Option C) is incorrect as Acarbose decreases the absorption of digoxin. Miglitol decreases the absorption of propranolol & ranitidine. Negligible risk to administer in patients with kidney disease (Option D) is incorrect, these drugs are contraindicated to use in patients with stage 4 kidney disease.

        "D": "Add another antidiabetic medication without changing the metformin dose"
      },
      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: C) Discontinue metformin Explanation: Metformin is immediately discontinued in individuals with elevated serum creatinine levels (>1.5 mg/dL in males and >1.4 mg/dL in females) , as it increases the risk of life-threatening lactic acidosis. Complications associated with Metformin: Renal failure is common with metformin use. Plasma metformin levels are inversely related to GFR due to reduced drug clearance. Current guidelines suggest the safe use of metformin when GFR is more than 30 mL/min/1.73 m 2 . Management: Assess renal function before starting metformin and monitor it annually. Discontinue if serum creatinine >1.5 mg/dL or eGFR < 30 mL/min/1.73 m 2 . Discontinue pre-emptively before radiographic procedures using contrast dyes (till 48 hours after the procedure until renal function normalises) and hospitalization for severe illness (sepsis). Dose adjustment is needed for cationic drugs excreted by renal tubular secretion, such as cimetidine, furosemide, nifedipine, etc. It is indicated in patients with severe pulmonary disease, heart failure, liver disease, or chronic alcohol abuse. (Option A) Intravenous sodium bicarbonate administration is the preferred treatment for metformin-associated lactic acidosis. (Option B) Metformin can be given at a maximum 2550 mg/day dose in patients with increased blood glucose levels without demonstrating any adverse effects. (Option D) If metformin monotherapy is not effective in controlling blood glucose levels in type 2 diabetics, the addition of sulfonylureas, GLP-1 receptor agonists, or DPP4 inhibitors may be beneficial.

It is indicated for the treatment of short bowel syndrome in adult patients who are dependent on parenteral support. Additionally, it can help improve glycemic control by addressing the underlying malabsorption issues in this patient population. Teduglutide Type Peptide hormone (GLP-2 analogue ) Mechanism of Action Teduglutide I Binds to GLP-2 Receptors on Intestinal Epithelial Cells I Activation of Guanylate Cyclase I Increased Production of cGMP I Activation of Protein Kinase G I Regulation of Tight Junctions and Epithelial Transporters I Enhanced Intestinal Absorption of Fluid and Nutrients I Improved Glycemic Control. Uses Treatment of short bowel syndrome (SBS) in adult patients who are dependent on parenteral support. Benefits Reduces dependence on parenteral nutrition Improves intestinal absorption and transit time Increases nutrient absorption and fluid balance Side Effects Nausea and Vomiting Headache Upper respiratory tract infection Contraindications Gastrointestinal obstruction or perforation Gastrointestinal cancer Special Points Requires subcutaneous injection Dosing and adjustment should be based on individual patient responses. Regular monitoring of nutritional status and fluid balance is essential. Metformin (Option A ) is contraindicated in patients with renal impairment, which is common in short bowel syndrome due to fluid and electrolyte imbalances.Additionally, it primarily reduces hepatic glucose production and improves insulin sensitivity, which may not directly address the nutrient absorption issues in short bowel syndrome. Pramlintide (Option B) is an amylin analogue that slows gastric emptying and reduces postprandial glucagon secretion. It does not address the underlying issue of nutrient malabsorption in short bowel syndrome. Sitagliptin (Option C) (DPP-4 inhibitor) enhances incretin levels, increasing insulin and decreasing glucagon secretion.Therefore, it has no role in short bowel syndrome.

Repaglinide Type Meglitinide Analogue Uses Type 2 DM Mechanism of Action Meglitinide Analogue I Bind to Receptors on Pancreatic Î² Cells I Closure of ATP-sensitive K+ Channels I Membrane Depolarization I Opening of Voltage-Gated CaÂ²+ Channels I CaÂ²+ Influx I Exocytosis of Insulin Granules I Increased Insulin Secretion. Side Effects Hypoglycemia Weight gain Headache Diarrhoea, Back pain cardiovascular events (e.g., myocardial ischemia) Liver enzyme abnormalities Metformin (Option D ): Primarily decreases hepatic glucose production and increases insulin sensitivity in peripheral tissues. It does not stimulate insulin release from pancreatic beta cells. Pioglitazone (Option B ): is a thiazolidinedione that improves insulin sensitivity by acting as an agonist for the(PPAR- Î³ ). This results in increased glucose uptake in muscle and adipose tissue and decreased glucose production in the liver. Acarbose (Option C): Is an alpha-glucosidase inhibitor that works by slowing down the digestion and absorption of carbohydrates in the small intestine.

      "question": "Which of the following sulfonylureas is considered the most potent?",
      "options": {
        "A": "Tolbutamide",
        "B": "Chlorpropamide",
        "C": "Glimepiride",
        "D": "Glipizide"
      },
      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: C) Glimepiride Explanation: Glimepiride is a third-generation sulfonylurea and is considered the most potent among the sulfonylureas. It is effective at lower doses (starting at 1 mg/day) and has a longer duration of action , leading to effective glucose control with fewer side effects compared to earlier generations. Comparison of sulfonylureas: Drug Generation Potency Starting Dose Tolbutamide First-generation Low 500 mg Chlorpropamide First-generation Lowâ€“Moderate 100â€“250 mg Glipizide Second-generation Moderateâ€“High 2.5â€“5 mg Glimepiride Third-generation Highest 1 mg Tolbutamide (Option A) : Incorrect. It is a first-generation agent with low potency and a short half-life. Chlorpropamide (Option B) : Incorrect. Though longer-acting than tolbutamide, it is less potent than newer sulfonylureas and has more side effects. Glipizide (Option D) : Incorrect. A second-generation sulfonylurea that is more potent than first-generation but less potent than glimepiride .
