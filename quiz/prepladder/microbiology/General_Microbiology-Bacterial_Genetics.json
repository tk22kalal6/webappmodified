      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: B) Escherichia coli Explanation: Escherichia coli is not capable of natural transformation and does not undergo transformation under normal conditions. It requires specific laboratory techniques (such as chemical or electroporation treatments) to artificially induce transformation competence. Natural genetic competence , the ability of bacteria to take up exogenous DNA, is common and plays a key role in horizontal gene transfer. This process is controlled by specialized proteins that form a DNA-uptake complex. Competence development is regulated by cell-cell signalling and environmental factors, such as nutrient availability. Bacterial Transformation: Definition Uptake of free DNA fragments by a bacterial cell, leading to heritable changes. Growth Phase Log phase of bacterial growth. Naturally Capable Bacteria Streptococcus pneumoniae (Option A ruled out) Haemophilus influenzae (Option D ruled out) Neisseria gonorrhoeae (Option C ruled out) Bacillus Acinetobacter Pseudomonas Historical Significance Griffith's Experiment (1928): Demonstrated transformation using Streptococcus pneumoniae in mice. Avery, MacLeod, and McCarty (1944): Identified DNA as the transforming principle.

      "question": "Transduction is the most common mode of resistance in which of the following organisms?",
      "options": {
        "A": "Escherichia coli",
        "B": "Staphylococcus aureus",
        "C": "Mycobacterium tuberculosis",
        "D": "Pseudomonas aeruginosa"
      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: B) Staphylococcus aureus Explanation: Transduction is a significant mode of resistance transfer in S. aureus, particularly for genes like penicillin resistance. Bacterial Transduction Definition : Transduction is a process where bacteriophages (viruses that infect bacteria) transfer genetic material between bacteria. Types : Generalised and specialized. Generalized Transduction Occurrence : Due to errors during the lytic cycle of virulent and sometimes temperate phages, which ends with the destruction of the host cell. Process : Any part of the donor bacterium's genome can be transferred when a phage accidentally packages host DNA instead of its own. Outcomes : Abortive Transduction : Donor DNA does not integrate and disappears. Stable Gene Transfer : Donor DNA integrates into the recipient's chromosome, causing a permanent change. Unstable Gene Transfer : Donor DNA is broken down and does not cause a lasting change. Specialized Transduction Occurrence : Linked to temperate phages that integrate their DNA into the host's chromosome (prophage). Process : Specific genes are transferred when a prophage incorrectly excises from the host chromosome, taking nearby bacterial genes during the transition from the lysogenic to the lytic cycle. Example : Lambda phage in E. coli, transferring genes for galactose utilization or biotin synthesis. Importance of Transduction Antibiotic Resistance : Transduces plasmids carrying antibiotic resistance genes (e.g., penicillin resistance in Staphylococcus aureus). Toxin Production : Bacteria gain virulence by acquiring toxin genes (e.g., Corynebacterium diphtheriae acquires a diphtheria toxin gene via lysogenic conversion). Escherichia coli (Option A): While E. coli can acquire resistance through various mechanisms, transduction is not its most common mode of resistance. Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Option C) primarily acquires resistance through mutations and horizontal gene transfer mechanisms other than transduction. Pseudomonas aeruginosa (Option D) commonly acquires resistance through plasmid-mediated conjugation and mutations, rather than transduction.

        "A": "It can transfer any segment of the donor bacterium's DNA.",
        "B": "It occurs due to packaging errors during the lytic cycle.",

      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: C) It transfers specific genes located near the prophage's integration site . site. Life Cycles of Bacteriophages Lytic Cycle : Virulent cycle. Bacteriophage replicates inside the host. Results in host cell death and release of new phages. (Option D ruled out) Lysogenic Cycle : Phage DNA integrates into the host's chromosome. Replicates with the host without harming it. Integrated phage DNA is called a prophage. The process is known as lysogenic conversion. There are two types of phages: Virulent phage: follow only the lytic cycle Temperate phage: follow the lytic and lysogenic cycle Lytic and Lysogenic cycle\" data-author=\"NA\" data-hash=\"9451\" data-license=\"NA\" data-source=\"NA\" data-tags=\"April2025\" height=\"600\" src=\"https://image.prepladder.com/notes/P6z1Dk3amaq7w2Hfswd81744382309.png\" width=\"600\" /> Types of Transduction Generalized Transduction : (Options A&B ruled out) Usually utilizes the lytic cycle Can transfer any segment of the donor bacterium's DNA. Occurs due to packaging errors during the lytic cycle. Fragments of host DNA are incorporated into phage particles. Phages inject donor DNA into a new recipient bacterium. Specialized Transduction : Usually utilizes the lysogenic cycle Transfers specific genes near the prophage's integration site. (Option C) Occurs when the prophage is excised from the host chromosome. Phage carries adjacent bacterial genes along with it. Example: Lambda phage in E. coli integrates between genes for galactose utilization and biotin synthesis, transducing only these genes.

      },
      "correct_answer": "D",
      "explanation": "Correct answer: D) A - 3; B - 4; C - 1; D - 2 Explanation: Hfr -A bacterial cell that can act as a donor in conjugation, having the F plasmid incorporated into its chromosomal DNA. F+ : A bacterial cell that has an F plasmid separate from its chromosomal DNA and can initiate conjugation. F I : A bacterial cell that lacks the F plasmid and can act only as a recipient in conjugation. F' : A bacterial cell with an F plasmid that has excised from the chromosome and carries some chromosomal genes. Conjugation: Transfer of genetic material from one bacterium (donor or male) to another bacterium (recipient or female) by mating or contact with each other and forming the conjugation tube. F+xF- Mating Hfr conjugation F’ conjugation The F+ cell donor or male bacterium contains the F factor plasmid and encodes for sex pilus formation and plasmid transfer. During conjugation, the F pilus forms a bridge to transfer a copy of the F factor plasmid to the F I recipient cell, converting it into an F+ cell. This process allows the new F+ cell also to initiate conjugation with other F I cells. F+ x F I = F+ The F factor plasmid can integrate into the bacterial chromosome and act as an episome, forming Hfr cells (high-frequency recombination cells). During conjugation, only a portion of the chromosomal genes and part of the F factor are transferred to the F I recipient cell. F I recipient does not become an F+ cell because the complete F factor is not transferred. Hfr with F I = rF I F factor can revert to a free state and carry adjacent chromosomal DNA, forming an F' factor. When an F' cell conjugates with an F I recipient, it transfers both the F factor and the incorporated chromosomal DNA, converting the recipient into an F' cell. F' x F = F' and F'. This process is known as sexduction.",

      "options": {
        "A": "Shows a high degree of resistance",
        "B": "Cannot be overcome by drug combinations",
        "C": "Virulence not decreased",
        "D": "Exhibits resistance to one drug at a time"
      },
      "correct_answer": "D",
      "explanation": "Correct answer: D) Exhibits resistance to one drug at a time Explanation: Transferable drug resistance is transferable to other organisms by horizontal spread (conjugation). Transferable drug resistance often involves plasmids or transposons that can carry genes for resistance to multiple drugs simultaneously, not just one drug at a time. This is a hallmark of multidrug-resistant organisms (MDR). Drug Resistance: The ability of a bacterium to resist a class of antimicrobial agents due to its inherent structural or functional characteristics. Types of drug resistance Mutational Drug Resistance Transferrable Drug Resistance Resistance to one drug at a time Multiple drug resistance at the same time (Option D) Low-degree resistance High-degree resistance (Option A ruled out ) Resistance can be overcome by a combination of drugs Cannot be overcome by drug combinations (Option B ruled out) The virulence of resistance mutants may be lowered Virulence not decreased (Option C ruled out) Resistance is not transferable to other organisms. Spread to off-springs by vertical spread only Resistance is transferable to other organisms. Spread by: Horizontal spread (conjugation, or rarely by transduction/transformation) Eg.

      "options": {
        "A": "They cleave double-stranded DNA at specific sequences",

        "C": "Bacteria protect their own genome from RE by Methylation",
        "D": "They only produce blunt ends"
      },
      "correct_answer": "D",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: D) They only produce blunt ends Explanation: Restriction digestion of double-stranded DNA produces two kinds of ends -Blunt ends and sticky ends Blunt ends- possess a 5’-phosphate group that promotes ligation. Compatible with other blunt-ended DNA. Sticky ends- small stretches of single-stranded DNA capable of self-ligation or ligation with a complementary region from another DNA molecule. The sticky ends possess 3’- or 5’-overhangs of 1–4 nucleotides Restriction endonucleases (Restriction Enzymes) Microbial enzymes that cleave ds-DNA at specific oligonucleotide sequences (Option A ruled out) . They identify a particular site of palindrome called the Restriction site and cut the DNA strands. For example, both the strands, i.e. the strand going from 5' to 3' and its complementary strand from 3' to 5' must be complementary. A typical nucleotide palindromic sequence would be TATA (5' to 3') and ATAT's complementary sequence from 3' to 5'. Restriction enzymes split DNA strands into fragments of varying lengths, which can be separated by gel electrophoresis. Eg. Eco RI, Hind III, Taq I The bacteria methylate their DNA at these identical sequences so that the restriction enzymes do not cut the DNA in their cell. (Option C ruled out) Most type II restriction endonucleases show an absolute requirement for divalent metal ions as cofactors for DNA cleavage - Mg2+ natural cofactor (Option B ruled out) Types and activities of restriction enzymes: Type Description I Cleaves DNA at random sites far from its recognition sequence II Cleaves DNA at defined positions close to or within its recognition sequence IIG Cleaves outside its recognition sequence with both restriction endonuclease and methyltransferase enzymatic activities in the same protein IIP Cleaves symmetric targets and cleavage sites IIS Recognizes asymmetric sequences III Cleaves outside its recognition sequence and require two sequences in opposite directions within the same DNA IV Cleaves modified DNA (e.g. methylated DNA) Reference: Mahon Lehman Textbook of Diagnostic Microbiology, 6th Edition, Page 21 Ananthanarayan and Paniker’s Textbook of Microbiology, 10th Edition, Page 65 Blunt & sticky ends Co-factor- Mg2+ Types & activities of restriction enzymes Palindromic sequence",

        "B": "To repair DNA",
        "C": "To cut DNA at specific locations",
        "D": "To transcribe RNA"
      },
      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: C) To cut DNA at specific locations Explanation: CRISPR system consists of an enzyme Cas9 that is used to cut through DNA at specific locations CRISPR-Cas9 Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeat. Unique organization of short, partially palindromic repeated DNA sequences found in the genomes of bacteria and other microorganisms. CRISPR's immune system can counter the attack of a viral infection by destroying the genome of the invading virus. The CRISPR immune system protects bacteria from ongoing viral infection by inhibiting its replication by destroying the viral genome. Mechanism: The CRISPR system has two components : Targeting device (a small strand of RNA programmed to look for a specific DNA sequence) Cutting device (an enzyme called Cas9 that can cut through DNA) (Options A, B & D ruled out ) The CRISPR immune system works via three basic steps: Step 1: Adaptation – Viral DNA is cut into short pieces and added to the CRISPR sequence. Step 2 : Production of CRISPR RNA – The CRISPR sequence is transcribed into RNA, which is then cut into smaller CRISPR RNAs. Step 3 : Targeting – These CRISPR RNAs guide bacterial proteins to destroy the matching viral DNA. CRISPR Defense Against Viruses: (a) Immunization Targeting Viral DNA : The memorizing complex of Cas proteins targets incoming viral DNA. Protospacer Selection : The complex identifies a protospacer region based on the viral genome's PAM (Protospacer Adjacent Motif) sequences. Excision of Protospacer : The protospacer is excised from the viral DNA. Spacer Insertion : The excised protospacer is inserted into the host CRISPR region , creating a unique spacer sequence for future immunity. (b) Interference: Transcription of CRISPR Region : The CRISPR region is transcribed into crRNAs , each corresponding to an individual spacer sequence. Binding of Cas Proteins : Cas proteins bind to the crRNAs, forming a complex that searches for complementary viral DNA. Formation of crRNA duplex : If a crRNA matches the viral DNA, a crRNA duplex is formed. DNA Cleavage : The endonuclease activity of the Cas proteins is activated, leading to the cleavage and degradation of the viral DNA, preventing the virus from replicating. This dual process of immunization and interference enables CRISPR to provide an adaptive immune defense against viral infections.",
