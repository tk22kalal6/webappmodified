The yeast form is typically more resistant to phagocytosis and immune responses, allowing the fungi to survive and multiply in the host. Dimorphic Fungus Have the ability to convert between two specific morphologic forms, yeast and hyphae. Types: Thermally dimorphic fungi: Converts between hyphae (22–25°C) and yeast (37°C), based on the temperature Thermally dimorphic fungi infect humans and other mammals Conversion to yeast within healthy and immunocompromised mammalian hosts is essential for virulence (Option B) Eg.

This option is incorrect. Production of endotoxins (Option C): Endotoxins are lipopolysaccharides found in the outer membrane of Gram-negative bacteria, not in fungi. Dimorphic fungi do not produce endotoxins. This option is incorrect. Direct cell-to-cell transmission (Option D): Dimorphic fungi are primarily transmitted through inhalation of spores from the environment and then converted to the yeast form within the host, rather than spreading directly from cell to cell.

(Option A ruled out) Tinea capitis Infection of the scalp; variants include favus and kerion. (Option B ruled out) Tinea corporis Infection of smooth, non-hairy skin (Tinea glabrosa). (Option D ruled out) Tinea cruris Infection of the groin and perineum (jock itch). (Option C) Tinea imbricata Tropical variant of Tinea corporis with concentric scaly patches. Tinea manuum Infection of the hand. Tinea pedis Infection of the foot (athlete's foot). Tinea unguium Infection of the nails. Classification by Genus Genus Key Characteristics Microsporum Predominantly macroconidia; spindle-shaped, multicellular structures; infects hair and skin. Trichophyton More abundant microconidia in clusters; macroconidia are thin, and elongated; include species like T. rubrum which is common in humans. Infects hair, nails and skin. Epidermophyton Lacks microconidia; club-shaped, multicellular macroconidia; infects skin and nails but not hair. Features Trichophyton Microsporum Epidermophyton 1. Site of infection Hair, nail, and skin Hair and skin only Skin and nail only 2. Colony Powdery pigmented Cotton-like pigmented Powdery greenish yellow 3. Spores a. Microconidia Abundant Relatively scanty Absent b. Macroconidia Pencil or cylindrical-shaped Spindle-shaped Club or pear-shaped Types of Conidia Microconidia : Small, unicellular conidia. Macroconidia : Larger, multicellular, septate conidia. Classification by Habitat Dermatophytes are further classified by their natural habitats: Habitat Type Characteristics Examples Anthropophilic Primarily found in humans; causes mild, chronic lesions. T. rubrum , E. floccosum , M. audouinii Zoophilic Natural parasites of animals; cause severe inflammation but are treatable. T. verrucosum , M. canis Geophilic Found in soil; less pathogenic to humans. M. gypseum , T. ajelloi",

      "question": "A 10-year-old child presents with hair loss and black dot tinea capitis. Microscopic examination of the hair reveals elongated hyphae within the hair shaft. Which of the following statements is true regarding the likely condition the child has?",
      "options": {
        "A": "Trichoscopy shows perifollicular scaling",
        "B": "It is commonly associated with Microsporum canis",
        "C": "It typically involves Trichophyton tonsurans and Trichophyton violaceum",
        "D": "The treatment of choice is typically 2 weeks"
      },
      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Trichophyton tonsurans and Trichophyton violaceum are the primary fungi responsible for endothrix infections, where the fungus penetrates the hair shaft, leading to less contagious forms of tinea capitis, such as black dot tinea capitis. This distinguishes them from Microsporum canis , which causes ectothrix infections characterized by superficial hair involvement and is more contagious. Hair perforation test: The hair perforation test is a diagnostic procedure used in dermatology to evaluate the presence of certain fungal infections, particularly Trichophyton species, which can cause scalp or skin conditions such as ringworm. This test assesses the ability of a hair to be penetrated or perforated by fungal elements, offering insight into whether a fungal infection may be affecting the hair Dermatophyte Infections: Endothrix vs. Ectothrix Endothrix Characteristics Invasion : Fungi invade and grow inside the hair shaft, with arthroconidia present within the hair; the cuticle remains intact. Common Species : Trichophyton tonsurans , Trichophyton violaceum (non-inflammatory tinea capitis). (Option C) Clinical Presentation : Presents as black dot tinea capitis; less contagious than ectothrix. Diagnosis Microscopy : Shows elongated hyphae within the hair. Trichoscopy : Features comma-shaped and corkscrew hairs. Treatment Antifungal Therapy : Griseofulvin; treatment duration: 6-12 weeks. (Option D ruled out) Ectothrix Characteristics Invasion : Fungi grow on the hair shaft surface, degrading the cuticle; hyphae and arthroconidia are on both the surface and inside the hair. Common Species : Microsporum canis (inflammatory tinea capitis). (Option B ruled out) Clinical Presentation : Appears as grey patch tinea capitis; spreads rapidly. Diagnosis Microscopy : Fungal structures on the hair shaft's exterior. Trichoscopy : Features perifollicular scaling. (Option A ruled out) Treatment Antifungal Therapy : Griseofulvin; treatment duration may be longer. The hair perforation test is a diagnostic tool used to differentiate dermatophyte species. It involves incubating hair with a fungal isolate in a sterile solution and",

      "options": {
        "A": "Trichosporon inkin",

      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "characterized by dark nodules on scalp hair and the presence of branched hyphae and arthrospores upon microscopic examination. Piedra Infection Superficial fungal infection affecting hair shaft. Characterized by nodules. Two main types: Black Piedra and White Piedra. Black Piedra Aspect Details Etiology Caused by Piedraia hortae (dematiaceous fungus) (Option B). Characteristics Affects scalp hair; it is common in individuals with long hair and poor hygiene. Clinical Features Hard, black nodules that may resemble lice nits; complex structure of filamentous hyphae and spores; examined using KOH shows branched hyphae and arthrospores. Diagnosis Direct microscopic examination: Branched hyphae and arthrospores Culture: Sabouraud dextrose agar shows dark colonies. Treatment Antifungal shampoos or systemic antifungals; treatment efficacy may be compromised by nodules' compact nature. White Piedra Aspect Details Etiology Caused by Trichosporon species, commonly Trichosporon beigelli, Trichosporon inkin (Option A ruled out). Characteristics Affects facial, axillary, and pubic hair; typically asymptomatic. Clinical Features Whitish, loosely adherent nodules consisting of arthroconidia and blastoconidia. Diagnosis KOH examination and culture reveal yeast-like colonies. Treatment Topical antifungals such as ketoconazole shampoo. Mixed Piedra Rare condition involving both black and white piedra Presents with both dark and light nodules Requires careful mycological examination for accurate diagnosis Candida albicans (Option C) : Candida albicans do not cause superficial fungal infections of the hair shaft like piedra. Microscopy shows Candida yeast with pseudohyphae. This option is incorrect. Malassezia furfur (Option D) : Malassezia furfur do not cause piedra. It primarily affects the skin and is involved in conditions related to skin oiliness rather than hard nodules along the hair shaft. Microscopy shows yeast cells grouped in a “grape bunch” format with short, branched filaments or spaghetti and meatball appearance. This option is incorrect.",
