Serratia marcescens 4.Ionizing Radiation a. Bacillus pumilus These control methods are biological indicators used to check the effectiveness of the sterilisation method. Spores of bacillus atrophaeus/subtilis are used as a control method for hot air ovens and ethylene oxide sterilisation (used mainly for heart-lung machines). Spores of geobacillus stearothermophilus are used as a control method for autoclave and plasma sterilisation . Bacillus globigi is also used as a control method for ethylene oxide sterilisation . Serratia marcescens and Brevundimonas diminuta are used as control methods for membrane filters . Reference: 1. Ananthanarayan and Paniker’s Textbook of Microbiology, 10th Edition, Page 30-32. 2.

      "explanation": "uses moist heat at a temperature > 100 o C. The autoclave (steam steriliser) works on the principle of steam production under pressure. When this steam meets a cooler surface, it condenses, transferring its heat to that surface. The process continues until the surface temperature matches that of the steam. The resulting condensed water provides moist heat, effectively killing microbes on the materials by protein denaturation. Its temperature settings are 121 o C for 15 minutes at 15 psi pressure. Materials that can be sterilised include linen, surgical instruments(non-sharps only), laboratory ware, pharmaceuticals, suture material except catgut(cold sterilisation) and culture media except egg and serum containing media(inspissation). Sterilisation control indicator - Geobacillus stearothermophilus Types of Autoclaves in Healthcare: Laboratory autoclaves Hospital dressing sterilisers Instrument sterilisers Rapid cooling sterilisers",

      "question": "Which test is used in the detection of long term glucose tolerance?",
      "options": {
        "A": "Fasting blood glucose",
        "B": "Random blood glucose",
        "C": "HbA1C",
        "D": "CBC"
      },
      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: C) HbA1C Explanation: HbA1C (Glycated hemoglobin) is the test used to assess long-term glucose tolerance and the average blood sugar levels over the past 3 months. It reflects the percentage of hemoglobin that has glucose attached to it, providing an indicator of overall blood sugar control. Incorrect Options: Fasting blood glucose (Option A) : This measures blood sugar levels after fasting for at least 8 hours. It is useful for diagnosing diabetes but does not provide a long-term view of glucose tolerance. Random blood glucose (Option B) : This measures blood glucose at any time of the day, regardless of when the person last ate. It is useful for diagnosing diabetes, but again, it does not provide a long-term assessment. CBC (Complete Blood Count) (Option D) : This is a blood test that measures various components of the blood, such as red blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets. It is not related to glucose metabolism. Reference: The A1C Test & Diabetes - NIDDK",

      "question": "Stain used to demonstrate fungal elements are?",
      "options": {
        "A": "Acid fast stain",
        "B": "Gabbet's stain",
        "C": "Methenamine silver",
        "D": "Leifson & Ryu's stain"
      },
      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: C) Methenamine silver Explanation: Methenamine silver stain is commonly used to demonstrate fungal elements in tissue samples. This stain binds to the cell wall of fungi and highlights the fungal structures, allowing them to be clearly visualized under the microscope. It is particularly useful in detecting fungal infections in tissues, as it stains the fungi in a black color against a light background , making identification easier. Detection Methods for Fungi: Method Description Use Direct Microscopic Examination KOH Preparation Dissolves keratin in clinical specimens (e.g., skin scrapings, nail clippings) to visualise fungal elements. Diagnosing dermatophyte infections Calcofluor White Staining Enhances fungal visibility by binding to chitin in cell walls, causing them to fluoresce under UV light. Observing fungal morphology Gram Stain Traditionally for bacterial identification; also useful for yeasts, which typically stain Gram-positive (purple). Detecting certain fungi India Ink Preparation Negative staining method for encapsulated yeasts (e.g., Cryptococcus neoformans), revealing a clear halo around cells. Identifying encapsulated yeasts Methenamine Silver and PAS Staining Histochemical techniques that stain fungi black (methenamine) or magenta (PAS) in tissue sections. Highlighting fungi in tissues Lactophenol Cotton Blue (LCB) Mount Enhances contrast in teased fungal colonies for morphological observation. Microscopic examination of fungi Serology Antibody Detection Identifies antibodies produced by the host in response to fungi using methods like ELISA. Tracking immune response to fungal infections Antigen Detection Detects fungal antigens in body fluids using techniques such as latex agglutination tests. Identifying fungal presence in the body Skin Tests Delayed-Type Hypersensitivity (DTH) Assesses previous exposure to fungi through localised reactions to injected antigens. Evaluating past fungal exposure Newer Rapid Diagnostic Tests Nucleic Acid Hybridisation Uses labelled DNA probes for rapid fungal DNA detection in clinical samples. Quick identification of fungal pathogens Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) Amplifies specific fungal DNA sequences, enabling early diagnosis even with low fungal loads. Early detection of fungal infections Acid fast stain (Option A) : This is used primarily for Mycobacterium species (e.g., Mycobacterium tuberculosis ), not fungi. The acid-fast stain highlights acid-fast bacilli by coloring them red, but it is not useful for fungal elements. Gabbet's stain (Option B) : This is not a commonly used stain for fungi. It is a variant of Gram staining, primarily used for bacterial identification, not for fungi. Leifson & Ryu's stain (Option D) : This is a staining method for bacteria , especially to highlight flagella in bacterial samples, and it is not used to stain fungal elements.

        "A": "Alkaline peptone water",
        "B": "Monsur's taurocholate tellurite peptone water",

      "correct_answer": "D",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer D - All of the above Explanation: Enrichment Broth: Liquid media with inhibitory agents selectively promote the growth of specific organisms and inhibit others. Used for isolating pathogens from clinical specimens containing normal flora (e.g., stool, sputum). Examples: Tetrathionate broth – Used for Salmonella Typhi isolation. Gram-negative broth – Used for Shigella isolation. Selenite F broth – Used for Shigella isolation. (Option C) Alkaline peptone water (APW) – Used for Vibrio cholerae isolation. (Option A) Lim Broth is an enrichment broth specifically used to enhance the growth of group B streptococci. It provides the necessary nutrients and conditions for the selective multiplication of these organisms.
