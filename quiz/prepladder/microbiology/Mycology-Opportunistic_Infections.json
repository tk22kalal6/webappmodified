It features non-septate hyphae that branch at right angles. Mucormycosis It is an invasive disease caused by zygomycetes (phycomycetes) - Rhizopus, Mucor and Absidia. Rhizopus Arrhizus is the most common pathogen Pathogenesis Begins in the respiratory tract or nasal cavity, where spores germinate and form mycelia → invade adjacent tissues, leading to local destruction. Fungi invade blood vessels, causing thrombosis and infarction in affected areas, which contributes to its high mortality rate (Angio-invasiveness) Common Sites Rhinocerebral Form : Involves the nose, nasal sinuses, and orbit; frequently seen in diabetic patients. Pulmonary Infections : When the lungs are the primary site, the fungi can invade lung arteries, leading to serious complications.

      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: B) Aspergillus infection Explanation: Galactomannan is primarily associated with Aspergillus infections, particularly invasive aspergillosis. Galactomannan is a component of the Aspergillus cell wall Detection of Galactomannan in serum or bronchoalveolar lavage fluid is a marker for the diagnosis of invasive aspergillosis in adults and children, in hematopoietic stem cell transplant recipients or in patients with hematologic malignancies. Galactomannan Test: Detects galactomannan, a carbohydrate antigen specific to Aspergillus species. Positive for: Aspergillus species False-negative for: Most fungi except Aspergillus; not reliable for Candida, Pneumocystis jirovecii, or Mucorales. Candidiasis (Option A) : Candidiasis is caused by Candida species, such as Candida albicans. While Candida infections can be serious, they do not typically produce galactomannan. Diagnosis is usually made through culture. Cryptococcosis (Option C) : Cryptococcosis is caused by Cryptococcus neoformans.The diagnosis usually involves detecting cryptococcal antigen (CrAg) in serum or cerebrospinal fluid or by Indian ink stain microscopy of CSF, not by detection of serum galactomannan. Mucormycosis (Option D) : It does not produce galactomannan. Diagnosis is typically through culture or histopathological examination, rather than serological tests for galactomannan.

(Statement ii) Serotypes A, D, AD serotypes - Cryptococcus variety neoformans (Statement iv) B, C serotypes -Cryptococcus variety gattii (Statement v) Virulence factors Polysaccharide Capsule : The primary virulence factor. It helps the pathogen evade phagocytosis and suppresses the host’s local immune responses, enabling the organism to survive and spread. Melanin Production : Cryptococcus produces melanin via the enzyme phenol oxidase, which contributes to its virulence by protecting the pathogen from oxidative stress and immune defenses. Enzyme Production : The fungus secretes several enzymes, including: Phospholipase : Aids in tissue invasion and damage. Urease : Helps the fungus survive in the host environment by neutralizing acidic conditions, enhancing its ability to colonize and spread. Risk of infection Immunocompromised States: HIV/AIDS, cancer, organ transplant recipients, those on immunosuppressive therapies, extremes of age are at higher risk.

Diagnosis is typically made through microscopy, culture, serological tests for cryptococcal antigen, and imaging studies for lung lesions. Treatment usually involves antifungal medications, such as amphotericin B and fluconazole, depending on the severity of the infection.

      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Correct answer: C) Pulmonary cryptococcosis Explanation: Pulmonary cryptococcosis is the most likely diagnosis due to the patient’s immunocompromised state and the solitary pulmonary nodule on imaging. Clinical features of cryptococcosis Respiratory system Cryptococcus typically enters the body via inhalation and can cause pulmonary infection/pneumonitis - primary site of infection Patients may present with cough, pleuritic chest pain, and respiratory distress. Imaging shows a solitary pulmonary nodule Dissemination of pulmonary infection leads to involvement of other organs Central Nervous System Meningitis: Characterized by severe headaches, fever, altered mental status, sensory and memory loss, cranial nerve paresis and loss of vision It is the most serious type of cryptococcal infection Skin Cutaneous Cryptococcosis: Causes skin lesions, particularly in immunocompromised patients. Associated with C.neoformans var neoformans (serotype D) Other Organs Liver, spleen, and bones may be involved in disseminated infections Bacterial pneumonia (Option A) typically presents with acute symptoms like high fever and productive cough, and Imaging usually shows diffuse infiltrates or lobar consolidation, not a solitary nodule Pulmonary tuberculosis (Option B) often involves systemic symptoms (weight loss, night sweats) and typically presents as multiple nodules or cavitary lesions on imaging Lung abscess (Option D) presents with localized symptoms and is associated with bacterial infections. Imaging typically reveals a cavity filled with pus, not a solitary nodule. Reference: Ananthanarayan and Paniker's Textbook of Microbiology, 10th Edition, Page 617",

      "explanation": "Correct answer: B) India ink stain Explanation: The given scenario describes meningitis and India ink stain is used to visualize the organism in this scenario. The India ink stain (A type of negative stain) is specifically used to visualize the capsule surrounding Cryptococcus neoformans in CSF samples. A clear halo around the yeast cells indicates the presence of the capsule, which is an important virulence factor. Urease test positive Maltese cross appearance under polarising microscope Diagnosis of Cryptococcosis Microscopy India ink - Demonstrates the capsule, which appears as clear space surrounding the round budding yeast cells Mucicarmine stain: It stains the carminophilic cell wall of C. neoformans Culture Sabouraud Dextrose Agar , forming smooth, mucoid, cream-coloured colonies. Niger seed agar and bird seed agar : Demonstrates melanin production (brown colored colonies) due to phenol oxidase/laccase enzyme. The ability to grow at 37°C and hydrolyse urea differentiates C. neoformans from non-pathogenic cryptococci Antigen detection tests Demonstration of the capsular antigen by Precipitation and Latex agglutination test Treatment Initial Treatment with liposomal Amphotericin B and Flucytosine Maintenance Therapy with Fluconazole for 6-12 months, depending on immune",
