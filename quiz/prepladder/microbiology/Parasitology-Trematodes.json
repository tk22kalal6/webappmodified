Annelid (Option D ): Annelids, or segmented worms, include earthworms and leeches. They have a segmented body and a complete digestive system.

General Characteristics of Trematode Eggs Size and Shape: Trematode eggs vary in size, typically ranging from small (20-30 µm) to large (up to 150 µm). The shape can be oval, round, or slightly asymmetrical. Operculum: Many trematode eggs have an operculum, a lid-like structure, that facilitates the release of larvae (miracidia) upon contact with water. Spines or Knobs: Certain species, particularly Schistosoma, have distinctive spines (terminal or lateral) used for species identification. Embryonation: Some eggs, such as those of Clonorchis and Opisthorchis, are embryonated upon excretion, meaning they contain a developed miracidium ready to hatch. Shell Color: Eggs often have a golden-brown appearance due to bile staining as they pass through the liver and intestines in many host species.

Epidemiology : Global Prevalence: Approximately 22 million cases and 10 species infect humans. Key Regions: World: Predominantly found in the Far East (Korea, Japan, Taiwan, China, Philippines). India: Endemic in Northeast states, particularly Manipur (prevalence: 6.7%). Morphology Adult worms: Leaf-like shape. Eggs: Operculated eggs. (Option A) They are oval and golden brown.

Second: Crabs or crayfish. Transmission Infection occurs through ingestion of infected crabs/crayfishes carrying metacercariae (infective larvae). Larvae penetrate the intestinal wall, enter the peritoneal cavity, and migrate to the lungs. Adult worms produce eggs, which are expelled through sputum (commonly) or feces. Pathogenicity and clinical features Pulmonary paragonimiasis: It causes eosinophilic granulomatous inflammation and cyst formation around worms, often in the right lung. Symptoms: Productive cough with brownish, blood-tinged sputum (offensive, fishy odor). Possible frank hemoptysis and peripheral blood eosinophilia . Chronic infections may lead to bronchitis, bronchiectasis, pneumonia, or lung abscesses. Extrapulmonary paragonimiasis: Worms may migrate to sites like the liver, spleen, abdominal wall , and occasionally the brain. Forms: Cerebral Paragonimiasis: this is a severe form.

Clonorchis sinensis \" Chinese liver fluke \": Parasite Clonorchis sinensis (Chinese liver fluke) is a parasitic fluke that causes clonorchiasis in humans. Transmission Acquired by consuming undercooked or raw freshwater fish contaminated with the parasite. Morphology Adult Fluke: Flat, leaf-shaped; 10-25 mm in length and 3-5 mm in width. Tapered anterior end and rounded posterior end. Body covered with tegument bearing tiny spines. Two suckers: oral sucker at the anterior end and ventral sucker (acetabulum) positioned further down. Egg: Oval, operculated (with a lid-like structure), yellow-brown in colour. Distinct operculum at the anterior end and a small knob at the abopercular end. Life Cycle 1. Egg Release: Infected individuals excrete eggs in feces, contaminating freshwater sources. 2. Snail Host: Eggs ingested by freshwater snails (first intermediate host) hatch and develop through stages: miracidia, sporocysts, rediae, and finally cercariae. 3. Fish Host: Cercariae are released from the snail into the water, where they seek and penetrate freshwater fish (second intermediate host), encysting as metacercariae in the fish’s muscle or skin. 4. Human Host: Humans become infected by consuming raw or undercooked fish containing metacercariae, which excyst, migrate to the bile ducts, and mature into adult flukes. 5. Egg Laying: Adult flukes in bile ducts lay eggs that are excreted in feces, completing the life cycle. Presentation Features Acute Infection: Symptoms are often mild or absent. When present, it may include right upper quadrant abdominal pain, fever, fatigue, nausea, diarrhea, and eosinophilia. Chronic Infection: Long-term infections may lead to biliary obstruction, cholangitis, cholecystitis, or gallstones. Severe cases can cause liver cirrhosis, bile duct cancer ( cholangiocarcinoma ), and pancreatitis. Investigations 1. Stool Examination: Microscopy for characteristic eggs in stool samples (primary diagnostic method; eggs may be scarce in light infections). 2. Duodenal Aspirate/Bile Examination: Detects eggs in bile samples or duodenal aspirates, helpful when stool examination is inconclusive. 3. Serology: Blood tests to detect antibodies or antigens specific to Clonorchis sinensis. 4. Imaging: Ultrasound may show biliary dilatation or thickening, suggestive of chronic infection. CT/MRI useful for identifying biliary obstruction, liver abnormalities, or cholangiocarcinoma in severe cases. Management Praziquantel (Drug of Choice): Dosage 25 mg/kg orally, three times daily for 2 days. Alternative: Albendazole can be used if Praziquantel is contraindicated.",
