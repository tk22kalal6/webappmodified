      },
      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: A) Fetal liver, targeting erythroid progenitor cells Explanation: This case suggests Parvovirus B19 infection due to recent exposure to a child with a “slapped cheek” rash and the patient’s anemia with low reticulocytes, indicating a transient aplastic crisis . Parvovirus B19 specifically targets erythroid progenitor cells by binding to the P antigen , halting red blood cell production. In the fetus, this viral tropism affects the fetal liver . Parvovirus Morphology Simplest animal viruses infecting humans, responsible for erythema infectiosum (fifth disease). Smallest viruses (18–26 nm in size). Non-enveloped with icosahedral symmetry. Only DNA viruses with single-stranded DNA . Dependent on host cell enzymes for replication. Pathogenesis Exclusively infects humans. Transmission : Primarily through the respiratory route . Blood transfusion. Transplacental transmission. Target Cells : Tropism for erythroid progenitor cells in adult bone marrow and fetal liver . (Option A) Receptor Binding : Binds to blood group P antigen on RBC surface. Effects : Leads to RBC destruction and inhibition of erythropoiesis, potentially causing anemia. Parvovirus B19 targets erythroid progenitor cells, not myeloid progenitor cells (Option B) , leading to anemia rather than affecting white blood cell function. The virus does not specifically affect the fetal spleen (Option C) ; its primary pathology occurs in the bone marrow and fetal liver. Parvovirus B19 does not target trophoblasts in the placenta (Option D) ; its main impact is on erythropoiesis in the fetal liver, not direct placental damage.",

      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "scenario, painful, itchy swelling and erythema of the hands and feet, along with B/L papular lesions on his palms and soles as shown in the figure, indicate papular-purpuric gloves and socks syndrome associated with Parvovirus B19 . This syndrome typically follows mild viral symptoms, aligning with the boy's recent flu-like illness. Parvovirus B19 targets erythroid progenitor cells , leading to the characteristic rash. Clinical Manifestations of Parvovirus infections: Erythema Infectiosum (Fifth Disease) (Option A ) Children: \"Slapped cheek\" facial rash. Adult women: Symmetrical polyarthropathy, often in hand and knee joints. Transient Aplastic Crisis : Severe acute anemia in patients with pre-existing hemolytic anemia. Pure Red Cell Aplasia : Chronic anemia in immunocompromised individuals due to persistent B19 infection. Non-Immune Hydrops Fetalis : Fatal fetal anemia and death; occurs via transplacental transmission (30% of cases) Highest risk in the second trimester. Papular-Purpuric Gloves and Socks Syndrome : Painful, itchy, and symmetric swelling and erythema of distal hands and feet; may mimic acute meningococcemia. (Option B) Laboratory Diagnosis PCR : Highly sensitive, detects viral DNA (VP1, VP2 genes) in serum, tissue, or respiratory secretions. ELISA : Detects IgM antibody (early indicator, elevated 2–3 months) and IgG against VP1 and VP2 antigens. Immunohistochemistry : Detects viral antigens in fetal tissues and bone marrow. Bone marrow cytology shows Giant pro-erythroblasts with multiple cytoplasmic projections that look like \"dog ears\" or \"pseudopodia\" . Hand, foot, and mouth disease (Option C) typically features vesicular lesions on the palms and soles , and around mouth which do not match the boy’s papular lesions and swelling.

      "explanation": "Correct Answer: C) BK virus Explanation: This case points to BK virus nephropathy, common in kidney transplant recipients , indicated by renal dysfunction and \"decoy cells\" with enlarged nuclei and ground glass appearance of cytoplasm with basophilic viral inclusions in the urine. Decoy cells are infected renal tubular epithelial cells found in urine and are a sign of polyomavirus (PV) replication. BK virus reactivates in immunocompromised hosts, and PCR confirmation of viral DNA aligns with its role in post-transplant nephropathy. Papovaviridae: Papovaviridae includes 2 main genera: Polyomavirus : Contains simian vacuolating virus (SV40) & human polyomaviruses (JC and BK). Papillomavirus Polyomavirus MCV Merkel cell polyomavirus. Causes merkel cell cancer. CK7+ & CK 20-ve. SV40 Simian vacuolating virus (SV40) Associated with mesothelioma. BK virus (Option C) BK virus is a polyomavirus with double-stranded DNA , typically causing: Nephropathy in kidney transplant recipients. The time period of nephropathy is after 6 months post-transplant. Hemorrhagic cystitis in hematopoietic stem cell transplant recipients. Infections in immunocompetent individuals are often asymptomatic. Cytologic examination of urine can reveal “decoy cells” . These characteristic cells have enlarged nuclei with a single, basophilic, intranuclear inclusion, which mimics cancer cells on pap smear.

        "D": "Varicella"
      },
      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: C) Monkeypox virus Explanation: The patient has monkeypox as per his symptoms of fever, skin rashes, and, most importantly lymphadenopathy after a visit and contact with wild animals. The monkeypox virus causes monkeypox disease, and the clinical symptom of lymphadenopathy differentiates it from other pox virus infections and chickenpox. Poxviruses Poxviruses are the largest viruses that infect vertebrates. Morphology Poxviruses measure approximately 400 nm in length and 230 nm in diameter, making them visible under a light microscope. Poxviruses are typically brick-shaped or ellipsoid. They possess an envelope consisting of two lipoprotein membranes (outer and inner), and the outer membrane features ridges. The envelope encases a core, along with two structures of unknown function known as lateral bodies. The core or nucleocapsid is biconcave and shaped like a dumbbell. Poxviruses contain a single linear double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) genome. They are unique among DNA viruses for replicating in the cytoplasm . Human-Important poxviruses Variola is the causative agent of smallpox, the first disease to be eradicated globally. Vaccinia : Used as a vaccine for smallpox. Molluscum contagiosum Virus : Causes warty lesions known as molluscum contagiosum. Genera classification Orthopoxvirus: Smallpox, monkeypox, vaccinia. Molluscipoxvirus: Molluscum contagiosum. Parapoxvirus: Milker’s nodules, bovine papular stomatitis viruses, etc. Capripoxvirus: Sheeppox, goatpox, lumpy skin disease, etc. Avipoxvirus: Fowlpox, pigeon pox, etc. Leporipoxvirus: Myxoma, hare fibroma, etc. Suipoxvirus: Swinepox virus. Yatapoxvirus: Tanapox, Yabapox viruses. Monkeypox infections The monkeypox virus belongs to the Orthopoxvirus genus . Monkeypox is a rare zoonotic infection first recognized in captive monkeys in 1958. Transmission Infection likely occurs through direct contact with wild animals . The exact primary reservoir host remains unidentified, but species such as squirrels, rabbits , and rodents can be infected. Clinical features Symptoms resemble those of smallpox but are generally milder. Fever and rash. Lymphadenopathy is a prominent feature in most cases, unlike in smallpox or chickenpox. Complications Respiratory distress Secondary bacterial infections Vaccination The vaccinia vaccine can offer protection against monkeypox or lessen its severity. Human-to-Human transmission Transmission between humans is considered limited. Estimates suggest that only about 15% of close contacts of infected individuals become infected. Variola (Option A) : This virus causes smallpox, characterized by highly contagious and severe rashes, which is a disease eradicated in 1980. It is caused by two strains of the virus, variola major and minor. Lymphadenopathy is not a sign of this disease. Vaccinia (Option B) : This virus is used in the development of vaccines for smallpox and is even effective in preventing monkeypox. This is an artificially made virus and does not have any pathogenicity in humans. Varicella (Option D) : This is a human herpes virus that causes chickenpox , a viral infection that has symptoms of fever, malaise, and a rash. Skin rashes are characteristic of the disease that develop from maculopapules to vesicles to scabs as the",

      "correct_answer": "D",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: D) Cross-infection from animal pox viruses Explanation: Cross-infection from animal pox viruses is not a factor that helped in the eradication of smallpox even though they produce similar and milder illnesses. Smallpox virus Smallpox was the first infectious disease eradicated globally, characterized by highly contagious and severe rashes. The disease was caused by two strains: variola major and variola minor. Transmission The virus enters through the mucous membranes of the upper respiratory tract via aerosol transmission . Clinical manifestations Incubation period : Typically lasts 12 days (ranging from 7 to 17 days) before the appearance of rashes. Rash characteristics : Unique rashes that are distinguishable from chickenpox. Deep-seated rashes that appear simultaneously in affected areas with a slow evolution. Centrifugal distribution : rashes initially affect the palms, soles, and extensor surfaces. The fever subsides with the appearance of the rash. Exanthem progression : the disease featured a single crop of centrifugal exanthems that progressed through several stages: Macular stage : Flat, discolored lesions. Papular stage : Raised bumps. Vesicular stage : Fluid-filled blisters. Pustular stage : Pus-filled lesions. Laboratory Diagnosis Direct detection: Intracytoplasmic inclusion bodies known as Paschen bodies can be identified in rash scrapings. Electron microscopy reveals a brick-shaped appearance with a biconcave DNA core. Egg inoculation : Characteristic pock formation observed on the chorioallantoic membrane (CAM) of chick embryos. Eradication of smallpox The World Health Organization declared the eradication of smallpox nearly three years after the last recorded case, on May 8, 1980. Factors that helped the eradication Variola had no animal reservoirs. (Option C) Patients were the only source, and no carriers existed (subclinical disease). (Option A) Characteristic rashes made identification straightforward. Asymptomatic cases did not spread the disease. Global Eradication Program: Launched by WHO in 1967, leading to eradication in about 10 years through international cooperation.

Adenovirus Adenoviruses are non-enveloped DNA viruses characterized by icosahedral symmetry. They feature fiber proteins extending from each vertex, creating a distinctive appearance reminiscent of a space vehicle . Morphology Adenoviruses range from 70 to 75 nm in diameter. It is composed of 252 capsomers forming an icosahedron . Capsomer Types: Hexons and Pentons. Each penton includes: A penton base anchored in the capsid. A fiber projection consisting of a rod-like portion with a knob at the end. Clinical manifestations While many serotypes can cause disease, types 1–7 are the most prevalent. Respiratory infections Upper respiratory tract infections: Common in children Primarily caused by serotypes 1, 2, and 5 . (Option A) In adolescents, serotypes 3, 4, and 7 are responsible for mild infections. Pneumonia : Types 3, 7, and 21 account for 10-20% of childhood pneumonia cases.
