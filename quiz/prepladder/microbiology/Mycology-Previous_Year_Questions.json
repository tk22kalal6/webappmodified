      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: C) 1 only Explanation: Galactomannan is primarily associated with Aspergillus infections , particularly invasive aspergillosis. Galactomannan is a component of the Aspergillus cell wall Detection of Galactomannan in serum or bronchoalveolar lavage fluid is a marker for the diagnosis of invasive aspergillosis in adults and children, in hematopoietic stem cell transplant recipients or in patients with hematologic malignancies. Galactomannan Test: Detects galactomannan, a carbohydrate antigen specific to Aspergillus species. Positive for: Aspergillus species False-negative for: Most fungi except Aspergillus; not reliable for Candida, Pneumocystis jirovecii, or Mucorales. Various fungi can generate galactomannan and cross-reactivity may happen, as seen with Histoplasma capsulatum, Paracoccidioides brasiliensis, and Cryptococcus neoformans. Invasive Aspergillosis (Statement 1): Galactomannan is a polysaccharide component of the Aspergillus cell wall and is released into the bloodstream during invasive infection. Serum galactomannan antigen testing is used for early diagnosis of invasive aspergillosis, especially in immunocompromised patients (e.g., neutropenia, hematologic malignancies, transplant recipients). Systemic Candidiasis (Statement 2): Candida species do not produce galactomannan. Instead, (1 → 3)- β -D-glucan is detected in the serum for invasive candidiasis. Mucormycosis (Statement 3): Mucorales fungi (Rhizopus, Mucor, etc.) lack galactomannan in their cell wall. Diagnosis relies on histopathology and PCR rather than antigen tests. Histoplasma capsulatum (Statement 4): It can be detected in urine and serum but is distinct from Aspergillus galactomannan.

      },
      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: C) Trichophyton mentagrophytes Explanation: Tinea capitis is a fungal infection of the scalp, commonly caused by dermatophytes. In this case, the white powdery colonies observed from the hair specimen and the positive hair perforation test are key diagnostic clues. Trichophyton mentagrophytes is a common cause of tinea capitis , and it is known for producing white, powdery colonies on culture media. The hair perforation test is used to differentiate dermatophytes, and a positive result indicates that the organism can break down the hair shaft, a characteristic feature of Trichophyton mentagrophytes . Trichophyton mentagrophytes is also capable of infecting both the hair and skin , and its positive perforation test helps distinguish it from other dermatophytes. Hair Perforation Test Purpose : Differentiate between Trichophyton rubrum and Trichophyton mentagrophytes . Procedure Place strands of human hair in a petri dish with 20 ml of distilled water. Autoclave the dish. Add sterile 10% yeast extract and fragments of the test fungus to the hair. Incubate at 25°C for 2-3 weeks. Examine the hair microscopically with a lactophenol cotton blue-stained wet preparation. Test Results Positive- If T. mentagrophytes is present: The hair shaft appears wedge-shaped due to surface erosion. (Option C) Negative- T. rubrum (Option A ruled out) Characteristics of Fungal Infections: Both T. rubrum and T. mentagrophytes cause ectothrix hair infections, where arthrospores form a sheath around the hair. T. rubrum is the most common dermatophyte in humans, often leading to chronic, treatment-resistant lesions. Identification Methods Method Description Macroscopic examination Assess the growth rate, texture, and colour on media Urea hydrolysis test Determines ability to hydrolyze urea Growth on polished rice or special media Tests the ability to grow in specific conditions Temperature tolerance test Assesses resistance to elevated temperatures Nutritional requirements test Checks requirements for specific amino acids and vitamins Incorrect Options: Trichophyton rubrum (Option A) : This species is typically associated with tinea corporis (ringworm), tinea pedis (athlete’s foot), and onychomycosis (nail infection). It produces red to yellowish colonies and does not typically give a positive hair perforation test , making it less likely to be the cause of tinea capitis in this case. Trichophyton schoenleinii (Option B) : This organism is a rare cause of tinea capitis , especially in children , and is known for producing scaly, grayish-white colonies . It typically produces a negative hair perforation test , so it is unlikely in this case. Trichophyton violaceum (Option D) : This species is associated with tinea capitis , but it usually forms purple or violet-colored colonies rather than white powdery colonies. Moreover, it does not typically show a positive hair perforation test , making it less likely as the causative agent in this case.",

      "explanation": "Correct Answer: C) Sporozoites adhere to intestinal mucosa Explanation: The organism described is Cryptosporidium , which exhibits autoinfection due to thin-walled oocysts that do not exit the host and instead continue the infection cycle, contributing to chronic diarrhea in immunocompromised patients. (Option A ruled out) After ingestion, the sporozoites excyst from oocysts in the small intestine and attach to the intestinal epithelial cells, leading to malabsorption, secretory diarrhea, and epithelial damage. Life Cycle of Cryptosporidium 1. Ingestion of Infective Oocysts : Humans or animals ingest fully mature (sporulated) oocysts from contaminated water, food, or surfaces. 2. Excystation : In the host’s small intestine, the oocyst releases four sporozoites, which then attach to the intestinal epithelial cells. 3. Trophozoite Formation : The sporozoites develop into trophozoites within parasitophorous vacuoles (specialised compartments) in the brush border of the host’s intestinal cells. 4. Asexual Reproduction (Schizogony) : Trophozoites undergo asexual reproduction to form type I meronts, each containing eight merozoites. 5. Release of Merozoites : The merozoites are released, infect new epithelial cells, and may undergo schizogony again to form more type I meronts or transition into type II meronts. 6 . Sexual",

Low-Dose Oral Glucocorticoids: Prednisolone (7.5–10 mg daily) is generally recommended to suppress immunopathological responses and prevent progressive tissue damage. Steroid-dependent cases: Itraconazole (400 mg/day) for 16 weeks Management of exacerbations: Prednisolone (40–60 mg daily) Invasive disease: Primary treatment: Voriconazole, Isavuconazole, Posaconazole. Monitor for drug interactions, especially with rifampin and carbamazepine. Chronic pulmonary disease: Primary treatment is Voriconazole and Itraconazole . Persistent symptoms: Bronchoscopy should be performed to remove impacted mucus and facilitate prompt lung re-inflation. Surgical interventions: Necessary for certain cases, such as: Fungal sinus balls Single aspergillomas Invasive forms affecting the heart, lungs, or brain Prophylaxis: High-Risk Situations: Antifungal prophylaxis for patients at moderate or high risk, particularly post-induction therapy for acute myeloid leukaemia Common agents: Itraconazole and posaconazole (more effective in reducing infection rates). Itraconazole (Option A): Used for chronic pulmonary aspergillosis (CPA) and allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis (ABPA), but not first-line for invasive disease. Lyophilized Amphotericin B (Option C): Used as second-line therapy if voriconazole is contraindicated. Posaconazole (Option D): Used for prophylaxis in high-risk immunocompromised patients (e.g., leukemia, bone marrow transplant)",

      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: A) Oral Candidiasis Explanation: Oral candidiasis (thrush) is a common opportunistic infection in HIV-positive patients, caused by Candida species, most commonly Candida albicans. Clinical Features: White, curd-like plaques on the tongue, buccal mucosa, and palate Easily scraped off, leaving erythematous mucosa underneath Microscopy Findings: Budding yeasts and pseudohyphae, seen on potassium hydroxide (KOH) mount or Gram stain Strongly associated with immunosuppression, particularly CD4+ count < 200 cells/mm³ in HIV patients. Oral candidiasis Oral candidiasis, commonly known as thrush , is an infection caused by an overgrowth of Candida albicans, a type of yeast. Presentation Presence of white patches that can be scraped off leaving behind a red inflamed base Risk factors Diabetes : Poorly controlled diabetes creates a favorable environment for Candida growth due to elevated blood sugar levels. Neutropenia Immunosuppression : HIV/AIDS, cancer, or immunosuppressive medications increases susceptibility. Use of inhaled corticosteroids Antibiotic Use : Broad-spectrum antibiotics can disrupt normal oral flora, allowing Candida to overgrow. Poor Oral Hygiene : Lead to an increase in fungal colonization. Dry Mouth : Conditions that lead to reduced saliva production can promote candidiasis. Treatment Antifungal medications, such as nystatin or fluconazole, along with addressing any underlying risk factors. C. krusei- Resistant to azoles Hairy leukoplakia (Option B): Caused by Epstein-Barr Virus (EBV) in HIV patients.

      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: A) Sporothrix schenckii Explanation: Sporothrix schenckii is a dimorphic fungus that causes sporotrichosis (also called “rose gardener’s disease”). It is introduced through traumatic inoculation (e.g., thorn pricks, splinters, scratches from plants or soil exposure). The cutaneous form starts as a painless papule at the inoculation site, which ulcerates and spreads along lymphatic channels (lymphocutaneous sporotrichosis). Sporotrichosis Causative agent Dimorphic fungus Sporothrix schenckii. Epidemiology Common in gardeners, forest workers , and manual labourers. Route of transmission Minor trauma or thorn prick. Clinical features Chronic infection affects cutaneous, subcutaneous, and lymphatic tissue. Lesions form at sites of minor trauma or thorn pricks, starting as nodules. Nodules ulcerate and necrose; infection spreads through lymphatic channels. Lymphocutaneous sporotrichosis: Secondary ulcers on lymph nodes; lymphatics become hardened and cord-like. Systemic dissemination: Can affect bones, joints, and meninges. Specimens Aspiration from nodules and biopsy material. Diagnosis Microscopy: KOH mounts or histopathological sections stained by methenamine silver stain show asteroid bodies (Splendore hoeppli phenomenon) Yeast phase: Cigar-shaped cells. Culture: Thin septate hyphae with flower-like clusters of small conidia; pear-shaped conidia in rosette-like clusters in mycelial phase. Serological tests: Helpful for extracutaneous or systemic infections. Treatment Medications: Itraconazole Terbinafine Amphotericin B: For disseminated infection Cryotherapy. Blastomyces dermatitidis (Option B): Causes blastomycosis, a systemic pulmonary fungal infection. Inhaled spores lead to lung disease and may disseminate to skin and bones. No direct traumatic inoculation. Coccidioides immitis (Option C): Causes coccidioidomycosis (Valley fever). Transmitted by inhalation of arthroconidia from desert soil and not associated with skin inoculation. Paracoccidioides brasiliensis (Option D): Causes paracoccidioidomycosis, a systemic mycosis. Transmitted via inhalation, leading to lung disease and mucocutaneous lesions. Not associated with traumatic skin inoculation.",

      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer A - Histoplasmosis: Explanation: Histoplasmosis is a fungal infection caused by Histoplasma capsulatum . It is commonly found in regions with soil that is enriched with bird or bat droppings, such as the Ohio River Valley . This makes the farmer from Ohio particularly at risk, as he may have been exposed to the fungus while working in environments with high concentrations of bird or bat feces. The key features of histoplasmosis on the chest x-ray (cavitary lesion with hilar lymphadenopathy) are consistent with this diagnosis, as the infection often affects the lungs and can lead to chronic pulmonary disease in immunocompetent individuals. In some cases, it may cause granulomatous lymphadenopathy . The appearance of Histoplasma on lactophenol cotton blue staining typically shows small, round, or oval yeast cells inside macrophages, which is characteristic of this fungal pathogen. Based on the patient’s history, histopathology showing intramacrophagic yeast form and (LPCB) mount showing numerous hyaline hyphae with few tuberculate macroconidia (arrows) and many smooth-walled oval microconidia are pointing towards a diagnosis of disseminated histoplasmosis. Histoplasmosis Causative Agent Histoplasma capsulatum; thermally dimorphic fungus. H. capsulatum var. capsulatum: Causes classical histoplasmosis.

Sporotrichosis Causative agent Dimorphic fungus Sporothrix schenckii. Epidemiology Common in gardeners , forest workers, and manual labourers. Route of Transmission Minor trauma or thorn prick. Clinical features Chronic infection affects cutaneous, subcutaneous, and lymphatic tissue. Lesions form at sites of minor trauma or thorn pricks, starting as nodules. Nodules ulcerate and necrose; infection spreads through lymphatic channels. IIIIIII Lymphocutaneous sporotrichosis: Secondary ulcers on lymph nodes; lymphatics become hardened and cord-like. Systemic dissemination: Can affect bones, joints, and meninges. Specimens Aspiration from nodules and biopsy material. Diagnosis Microscopy: KOH mounts or histopathological sections stained by methenamine silver stain show asteroid bodies (Splendore hoeppli phenomenon) Yeast phase: Cigar-shaped cells. (Option C) Culture: Thin septate hyphae with flower-like clusters of small conidia; pear-shaped conidia in rosette-like clusters in mycelial phase. Serological tests: Helpful for extracutaneous or systemic infections. Treatment Medications: Itraconazole Terbinafine Amphotericin B: For disseminated infection Cryotherapy. Coccidioides immitis (Option A) causes valley fever (coccidioidomycosis), primarily a respiratory illness, not associated with lymphatic ulcer spread. Aspergillus flavus (Option B) causes invasive aspergillosis, primarily affecting immunocompromised individuals. It does not cause lymphatic ulcers following trauma. Instead, it is associated with lung infections and aflatoxin production (hepatotoxicity). Trichophyton rubrum (Option D) is a dermatophyte that causes superficial fungal infections such as tinea, onychomycosis, and athlete’s foot, not deep tissue involvement with lymphatic spread.",

      "explanation": "Correct Answer: C) Cryptococcus neoformans Explanation: The patient’s presentation of persistent headaches, confusion, gradual onset of fever, and the findings from the lumbar puncture (elevated opening pressure and a positive India ink stain) strongly suggest cryptococcal meningitis , which is caused by Cryptococcus neoformans . Cryptococcus neoformans is a fungal pathogen that commonly causes meningitis in immunocompromised individuals , particularly those with HIV/AIDS . The hallmark of cryptococcal meningitis in a CSF analysis is the positive India ink stain , which reveals the characteristic encapsulated yeast cells. The elevated opening pressure on lumbar puncture is also a typical finding in this infection. Cryptococcus Spp. Cryptococcus is a true yeast. Capsule Polysaccharide capsule - helps in serotyping and protection against phagocytosis. Serotypes A, D, AD serotypes - Cryptococcus variety neoformans B, C serotypes -Cryptococcus variety gattii Virulence factors Polysaccharide Capsule : The primary virulence factor. It helps the pathogen evade phagocytosis and suppresses the host’s local immune responses, enabling the organism to survive and spread. Melanin Production : Cryptococcus produces melanin via the enzyme phenol oxidase, which contributes to its virulence by protecting the pathogen from oxidative stress and immune defenses. Enzyme Production : The fungus secretes several enzymes, including: Phospholipase : Aids in tissue invasion and damage. Urease : Helps the fungus survive in the host environment by neutralizing acidic conditions, enhancing its ability to colonize and spread. Risk of infection Immunocompromised States: HIV/AIDS, cancer, organ transplant recipients, those on immunosuppressive therapies, extremes of age are at higher risk. Geographic Location: Exposure to environments where Cryptococcus gattii is endemic, such as tropical and subtropical regions Environmental Exposure: Exposure to bird droppings or decaying wood can increase the likelihood of infection, especially with C. neoformans. Management of cryptococcosis Microscopy India ink - Demonstrates the capsule, which appears as clear space surrounding the round budding yeast cells Mucicarmine stain: It stains the carminophilic cell wall of C. neoformans Culture Sabouraud Dextrose Agar , forming smooth, mucoid, cream-coloured colonies.

Mucormycosis It is an invasive disease caused by zygomycetes (phycomycetes) - Rhizopus, Mucor and Absidia. Rhizopus Arrhizus is the most common pathogen Rhizopus: Absidia: Mucor (Lactophenol cotton blue stained): Pathogenesis Begins in the respiratory tract or nasal cavity, where spores germinate and form mycelia → invade adjacent tissues, leading to local destruction. Fungi invade blood vessels, causing thrombosis and infarction in affected areas, which contributes to its high mortality rate (Angio-invasiveness) Common Sites Rhinocerebral Form : Involves the nose, nasal sinuses, and orbit; frequently seen in diabetic patients. Pulmonary Infections : When the lungs are the primary site, the fungi can invade lung arteries, leading to serious complications. Others: Cutaneous mucormycosis, GI mucormycosis, Disseminated mucormycosis Clinical Features Rhinocerebral Zygomycosis : Facial swelling, nasal discharge (often black ), fever, and mucosal necrosis .

Therefore, this is not the correct answer in this case. Option C - Epidermophyton: Epidermophyton species are also dermatophytic fungi responsible for causing fungal skin infections. They can cause similar symptoms as described in the question, but the \"pencil-shaped appearance\" is not typically associated with Epidermophyton species. Instead, they produce smooth, thin-walled, and irregularly branched hyphae. Therefore, this is not the correct answer in this case. Option D - None of the above: This option is not the correct answer because the presentation of itching, redness, scaling, and the specific \"pencil-shaped appearance\" of hyphae in the skin sample is indicative of a dermatophytic fungal infection, and the most likely causative organism among the given options is Trichophyton.",

      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "referred to as aspergillosis. The hyphae of Aspergillus are septate, meaning they have cross-walls that divide the hyphae into distinct segments. These septate hyphae often branch at acute angles, forming a characteristic \"V\" or \"Y\" shape. This description matches the findings in the question. Incorrect Options: Option A - Mucor: Mucor is a type of fungus that can cause mucormycosis, also known as zygomycosis. The hyphae of Mucor are wide, ribbon-like, and non-septate (aseptate). In other words, they lack cross-walls or septa. Option C -Candida: Candida is a yeast that can cause candidiasis. Yeasts typically do not form septate hyphae. Instead, they form pseudohyphae, which are chains of elongated yeast cells. These pseudohyphae do not show the acute-angle branching seen in the question's description. Option D - Rhizopus: Rhizopus is another type of fungus that can cause mucormycosis. Similar to Mucor, the hyphae of Rhizopus are wide, ribbon-like, and aseptate. They lack the cross-walls seen in septate hyphae. Reference: .",

        "D": "Pneumocystis jirovecii"
      },
      "correct_answer": "D",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: D) Pneumocystis jirovecii Explanation: Pneumocystis jirovecii is an opportunistic fungal pathogen that causes Pneumocystis pneumonia (PCP), especially in HIV/AIDS patients with CD4 counts <200 cells/µL. The Gomori methenamine silver (GMS) stain reveals a round, crushed ping-pong ball–like cysts, which is characteristic of P. jirovecii. Pneumocystis jirovecii: Cause and Transmission Opportunistic Pathogen : Primarily affects immunocompromised individuals (e.g., HIV/AIDS patients with CD4+ counts <200 cells/mm³). Colonization in Healthy Individuals : Common in healthy lungs; most children are exposed by age 4. Reactivation in adults is possible from childhood exposure or new infections. Airborne Transmission : Spreads through person-to-person contact, especially in hospital settings. Colonized individuals exhale the organism, contaminating the environment. Reinfection vs. Reactivation : Both reinfection with new strains and reactivation of dormant infection are possible causes of recurrent PCP. Environmental Reservoir : Exact environmental source unknown, but the organism has been found in air samples near infected patients. Clinical Features General Symptoms Fever Nonproductive cough Dyspnea (shortness of breath) Tachypnea (rapid breathing) Symptom Variations by Immune Status Parameter HIV-Infected Patients Non-HIV Patients Onset Gradual (2 weeks to 2 months) Sudden (within a week) Symptom Severity Milder respiratory distress initially Rapid progression to respiratory failure Course Chronic Acute Oxygen Impairment Less severe More severe Incorrect Options: Paracoccidioides brasiliensis (Option A): Paracoccidioides brasiliensis causes paracoccidioidomycosis, commonly found in South America. The yeast form appears as pilot wheel (captain's wheel) structures on staining, not ping-pong ball-like cysts. Histoplasma capsulatum (Option B): Histoplasma capsulatum causes histoplasmosis, which may present with disseminated infection in AIDS patients. The yeast form appears as intracellular budding yeast within macrophages on GMS stain, not crushed ping-pong ball appearance. Coccidioides immitis (Option C): Coccidioides immitis causes coccidioidomycosis (Valley fever) and forms spherules containing endospores, not crushed ping-pong ball structures.

      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: A) Sporothrix schenckii Explanation: Sporotrichosis Causative agent Dimorphic fungus Sporothrix schenckii . Epidemiology Common in gardeners, forest workers , and manual labourers. Route of transmission Minor trauma or thorn prick. Clinical features Chronic infection affects cutaneous, subcutaneous, and lymphatic tissue. Lesions form at sites of minor trauma or thorn pricks, starting as nodules. Nodules ulcerate and necrose; infection spreads through lymphatic channels. Lymphocutaneous sporotrichosis: Secondary ulcers on lymph nodes; lymphatics become hardened and cord-like. Systemic dissemination: Can affect bones, joints, and meninges. Specimens Aspiration from nodules and biopsy material. Diagnosis Microscopy: KOH mounts or histopathological sections stained by methenamine silver stain show asteroid bodies (Splendore hoeppli phenomenon) Yeast phase: Cigar-shaped cells. Culture: Thin septate hyphae with flower-like clusters of small conidia; pear-shaped conidia in rosette-like clusters in mycelial phase. Serological tests: Helpful for extracutaneous or systemic infections. Treatment Medications: Itraconazole Terbinafine Amphotericin B: For disseminated infection Cryotherapy. Dimorphic Fungus Have the ability to convert between two specific morphologic forms, yeast and hyphae. Types: Thermally dimorphic fungi: Converts between hyphae (22–25°C) and yeast (37°C), based on the temperature Thermally dimorphic fungi infect humans and other mammals Conversion to yeast within healthy and immunocompromised mammalian hosts is essential for virulence (Option B) Eg. Blastomyces dermatitidis, Histoplasma capsulatum, Coccidioides immitis and posadasii, Paracoccidioides brasiliensis and lutzii, Sporothrix schenckii, Talaromyces marneffei, Emmonsia spp., Lacazia loboi. Nonthermal dimorphic fungi: Typically infects plants Histoplasma capsulatum (Option B) : This dimorphic fungus causes histoplasmosis , a respiratory infection, not a subcutaneous mycosis. Blastomyces dermatitidis (Option C) : This is also a dimorphic fungus, but it causes blastomycosis , which primarily affects the lungs, though it can disseminate to skin and other organs, but it's not classified as a subcutaneous mycosis. Penicillium marneffei (Option D) : This dimorphic fungus causes penicilliosis , a systemic infection that can affect the lungs, liver, and lymph nodes, primarily in immunocompromised individuals. It does not typically cause subcutaneous mycosis.",

      "explanation": "Correct Answer: C) India ink stain Explanation: India ink stain is commonly used for identifying Cryptococcus neoformans , particularly in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) . The stain highlights the capsule of the Cryptococcus organism, making it appear as a halo around the yeast, which is a characteristic feature of Cryptococcus neoformans . Cryptococcus Spp. Cryptococcus is a true yeast. Capsule Polysaccharide capsule - helps in serotyping and protection against phagocytosis. Serotypes A, D, AD serotypes - Cryptococcus variety neoformans B, C serotypes -Cryptococcus variety gattii Virulence factors Polysaccharide Capsule : The primary virulence factor. It helps the pathogen evade phagocytosis and suppresses the host’s local immune responses, enabling the organism to survive and spread. Melanin Production : Cryptococcus produces melanin via the enzyme phenol oxidase, which contributes to its virulence by protecting the pathogen from oxidative stress and immune defenses. Enzyme Production : The fungus secretes several enzymes, including: Phospholipase : Aids in tissue invasion and damage. Urease : Helps the fungus survive in the host environment by neutralizing acidic conditions, enhancing its ability to colonize and spread. Risk of infection Immunocompromised States: HIV/AIDS, cancer, organ transplant recipients, those on immunosuppressive therapies, extremes of age are at higher risk. Geographic Location: Exposure to environments where Cryptococcus gattii is endemic, such as tropical and subtropical regions Environmental Exposure: Exposure to bird droppings or decaying wood can increase the likelihood of infection, especially with C. neoformans. Management of cryptococcosis Microscopy India ink - Demonstrates the capsule, which appears as clear space surrounding the round budding yeast cells Mucicarmine stain: It stains the carminophilic cell wall of C. neoformans Culture Sabouraud Dextrose Agar , forming smooth, mucoid, cream-coloured colonies. Niger seed agar and bird seed agar : Demonstrates melanin production (brown colored colonies) due to phenol oxidase/laccase enzyme. The ability to grow at 37°C and hydrolyse urea differentiates C. neoformans from non-pathogenic cryptococci Antigen detection tests Demonstration of the capsular antigen by Precipitation and Latex agglutination test Treatment Initial Treatment with liposomal Amphotericin B and Flucytosine Maintenance Therapy with Fluconazole for 6-12 months, depending on immune status. Monitoring: Regularly check CSF for fungal clearance, renal function, and electrolytes. Management of Underlying Conditions: Optimize ART to reduce recurrence risk. Albert's stain (Option A) : This is used for staining Corynebacterium diphtheriae and is not suitable for identifying Cryptococcus . Silver stain (Option B) : This is typically used for identifying fungal organisms, especially fungal structures like spores and hyphae , but it is not the best stain for Cryptococcus. Auramine-rhodamine stain (Option D) : This is used for detecting mycobacteria (e.g., Mycobacterium tuberculosis ) through fluorescent microscopy , not for Cryptococcus .",
