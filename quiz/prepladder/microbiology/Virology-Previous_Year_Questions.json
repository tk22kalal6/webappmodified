      "question": "Which protein is present in the HPV vaccine?",
      "options": {
        "A": "E6 & E7",
        "B": "L1",
        "C": "E1 & E2",
        "D": "L2"
      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: B) L1 Explanation: The HPV vaccine is made using recombinant L1 protein, which forms virus-like particles (VLPs) that mimic the HPV outer capsid. These VLPs elicit a strong immune response without containing viral genetic material, making the vaccine safe and effective. Vaccine Name Cervavac (HPV4) Gardasil 4 (HPV4) Gardasil 9 (HPV9) Strain Number 4 4 9 L1 protein of Virus-like particles 6, 11, 16, 18 6, 11, 16, 18 6, 11, 16, 18, 31, 35, 45, 52, 58 Target Age (Girls) 9–26 years 9–45 years 9–45 years Target Age (Boys) 9-26 years 9–26 years 9–45 years Dose (Age < 15) 2 doses Dose (Age ≥ 15) 3 doses Schedule (Age < 15) 0, 6–12 months Schedule (Age ≥ 15) 0, 2, 6 months Dosage & Route 0.5 mL, intramuscular Injection Site Upper arm (deltoid) National Program In certain states for girls aged 11–13 years. IAP 2021 All young girls are recommended. (and boys in Cervavac) Catch-up Coverage Up to 45 years (preferably pre-sexual activity) in Gardasil 4 & 9. Only up to 26 years in Cervavac. Side Effects Local pain, swelling, erythema, fever, syncope (due to injection, not vaccine) C/I Anaphylaxis after the previous dose. Storage 2–8°C, protect from light. Note: Cervavac (HPV4) is licensed and recommended for both girls and boys in India, according to the recent guidelines by The Indian Academy of Pediatrics (IAP) as of January 2024. Cervarix (HPV2) , on the other hand, was used previously and only licensed and recommended for girls in India, and not for boys. Incorrect Options: E6 & E7 (Option A): E6 and E7 are oncogenic proteins of Human Papillomavirus (HPV) that play a role in carcinogenesis by inactivating tumor suppressor proteins (p53 and Rb, respectively). These are not included in the HPV vaccine, as their presence could pose a risk of oncogenic transformation. E1 & E2 (Option C): E1 and E2 are early proteins involved in HPV DNA replication and transcriptional regulation. They are not components of the HPV vaccine. L2 (Option D) : L2 is another capsid protein, but the HPV vaccine primarily uses the L1 protein to induce an immune response.

        "D": "Enveloped ds RNA"
      },
      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: A) Enveloped ssRNA Explanation: The clinical presentation described - cough , coryza , conjunctivitis , bluish-white spots on the buccal mucosa (Koplik spots) , and the development of a maculopapular rash - is highly suggestive of measles (also known as rubeola ). Measles is caused by the measles virus , which is an enveloped, single-stranded RNA (ssRNA) virus. Clinical Stages of Measles: Stage Duration Symptoms Incubation Period 10 days (up to 21 days) Asymptomatic phase; the virus multiplies in the respiratory tract, followed by primary and secondary viremia. Prodromal Stage 4 days Fever (day 10), Koplik’s spots (day 12), non-specific symptoms (cough, coryza, conjunctivitis). Eruptive Stage 4 days post fever The maculopapular rash appears first behind the ears, then spreads to the face, trunk, and limbs, fading in the same order. Post-measles Stage Variable Characterized by weight loss, weakness, and a risk of progressing to chronic conditions. Complications of Measles: A. Secondary Bacterial Infections Immune suppression following measles increases susceptibility to bacterial infections. Otitis media and bronchopneumonia are the most frequent bacterial complications. Worsening of underlying tuberculosis with a possible false-negative Mantoux test . B. Complications Due to Measles Virus Itself Giant-cell pneumonitis (Hecht’s pneumonia), primarily in immunocompromised and HIV-infected individuals. Acute laryngotracheobronchitis (croup). Diarrhea leading to malnutrition and vitamin A deficiency. C. Central Nervous System (CNS) Complications Subacute sclerosing panencephalitis (SSPE) : A rare but severe late complication characterized by progressive CNS deterioration. Other CNS complications include post-measles encephalomyelitis and measles inclusion body encephalitis . Incorrect Options: Naked ssRNA (Option B) : A virus with naked (non-enveloped) ssRNA does not fit the description of the measles virus . Naked ssRNA viruses, such as enteroviruses or hepatitis A virus , have different clinical presentations. Naked dsRNA (Option C) : There are no naked double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) viruses that cause symptoms like those seen in measles. Enveloped dsRNA (Option D) : Enveloped dsRNA viruses include the rotavirus (which causes gastroenteritis), but the clinical symptoms of rotavirus are not similar to measles.

      "explanation": "Correct Answer: B) Herpes simplex virus Explanation: The virus shown in the picture is a DNA virus. In the above image, the virus first binds to the cell and enters inside the cell by uncoating. After the entry of the virus inside the cell, three types of proteins, i.e., alpha, beta, and gamma, are formed via transcription and replication, which are pathognomonic of the herpes virus. It has two cycles: Lytic cycle: Immediate-early genes are expressed first, initiating the lytic life cycle of the virus, leading to the production of infectious virions and lysis of the host cell. Latent cycle: There is limited gene expression and a lack of infectious virus particles.

      "options": {
        "A": "Complement fixation",
        "B": "Superantigens",
        "C": "Heterophile antibodies",
        "D": "Haptens"
      },
      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: C) Heterophile antibodies Explanation: Heterophile Antigens Definition: A type of hetero-antigen present in different species that share epitopes. Cross-Reactivity: Antibodies produced against an antigen from one species can react with the heterophile antigen from another species and vice versa Diagnostic Applications: Heterophile antigens are used in various serological tests to detect antibodies in patient serum. Examples of Tests: Weil-Felix Reaction: Used to diagnose certain infections, such as rickettsial infections. Paul-Bunnell Test: Primarily used for diagnosing infectious mononucleosis. Cold Agglutination Test: This test is used to detect specific antibodies that cause agglutination at low temperatures. This test is primarily used to identify mycoplasma pneumonia. Streptococcus MG Test: Used to detect antibodies associated with streptococcal infections. Paul-Bunnell Test (Option C) Purpose: Diagnosis of infectious mononucleosis caused by the Epstein-Barr virus. Method: Utilizes sheep red blood cells (RBCs) as antigens to detect heterophile antibodies in the patient’s serum. Principle: In infectious mononucleosis, heterophile antibodies agglutinate sheep erythrocytes. These antibodies can also occur after serum injections and in some normal individuals. Procedure: The inactivated serum is prepared by heating at 56°C for 30 minutes The serum is mixed in doubling dilutions with an equal volume of a 1% sheep erythrocyte suspension. Incubate at 37°C for 4 hours. Interpretation: Examine for agglutination. An agglutination titer of 100 or above suggests infectious mononucleosis Note: The Paul-Bunnell test uses sheep erythrocytes ; the Monospot test, horse red cells. Incorrect Options: Complement fixation (Option A) is used to detect antigen-antibody reactions by assessing complement consumption. It is used in viral infections like influenza, syphilis, and fungal infections. Superantigens (Option B) are proteins that cause excessive T-cell activation by bypassing normal antigen presentation. They are associated with toxic shock syndrome (Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pyogenes) Haptens (Option D) are small molecules that can trigger an immune response only when attached to a larger carrier protein. They play a role in drug allergies and some immune reactions. Reference: Textbook of Microbiology, Ananthanarayan & Paniker, 10th Edition, Page 482",

      "correct_answer": "D",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: D) Real-time RT-PCR Explanation: The detection of the target sequences against the RdRp gene, E gene, N gene, and ORF1 confirms the diagnosis of coronavirus. Real-time RT-PCR is a gold standard test for the diagnosis of coronavirus Real-Time RT-PCR for COVID-19 Diagnosis Real-time reverse transcriptase PCR (RT-PCR) is the gold standard for diagnosing COVID-19. Turnaround Time : The average time from sample receipt to result generation is approximately 4-5 hours. Capacity : Can process up to 90 samples in a single run, making it efficient for frontline testing. Gene Targets : Screening (Genus Specific) : Spike protein (S) Envelope protein (E) Membrane protein (M) Nucleocapsid protein (N) Confirmation (Species Specific for SARS-CoV-2) : RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) Open reading frames (ORF1a/b) N2 nucleocapsid Principle of Testing : Qualitative real-time PCR amplifies target genes in the specimen using a thermocycler. Fluorescence is generated when the amplicon binds to the probe, with the cycle threshold (Ct) indicating positivity. A sample is considered positive if both screening and confirmatory genes are detected with a Ct value ≤ 40 cycles. Detectability : NAAT can be positive as early as day 1 of symptom onset (usually 5 days post-infection) and generally declines by the third week, often becoming undetectable thereafter. Automated Real-Time RT-PCR Systems include Truenat and CBNAAT (Cartridge-based nucleic acid amplification test, e.g., GeneXpert). Widely accessible Turnaround Time : Quick results in 30-60 minutes. Automation : Fully automated with minimal handling, reducing biosafety hazards. Gene Targets : CBNAAT : E gene for screening, N2 gene for confirmation. Truenat : E gene for screening , RdRp gene for confirmation. Disadvantages : Limited to 1-4 samples per run, suitable for low sample loads (24-48 samples/day). Antigen Detection Rapid chromatographic immunoassay (SD Biosensor) for qualitative detection of SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid protein. Sample Collection : Nasopharyngeal swab immersed in viral extraction buffer to inactivate the virus and release the antigen. Point-of-Care Testing : Conducted at the bedside within one hour; antigen stability is limited to one hour.

      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: A) Dengue Explanation: Dengue virus: Dengue virus (DENV) is the most common arbovirus in India, belonging to the Flaviviridae family. It is an enveloped virus with single-stranded RNA (ssRNA). DENV has four serotypes (DEN-1 to DEN-4), with a fifth serotype (DEN-5) discovered in 2013 in Bangkok. Vector: Vectors : Aedes aegypti (main) and Aedes albopictus; both bite during the day. Pathogenesis: Primary Dengue Infection: Occurs upon first infection with any one dengue serotype. Secondary Dengue Infection: Results from infection with a different serotype than the one involved in the primary infection. The secondary infection is more severe and can lead to Dengue hemorrhagic fever or Dengue shock syndrome. Antibody Response Against Dengue Virus : Dengue virus infection induces both neutralizing and non-neutralizing antibodies. Neutralizing Antibodies: Protective and produced against the infective serotype (lasting for life) and other serotypes (temporary cross-protection). Protection Duration: Lifelong protection against the infective serotype, while cross-protection to other serotypes diminishes over a few months. Non-Neutralizing Antibodies: Last for life and are heterotypic, produced against other serotypes but not the infective ones. During a secondary dengue infection, antibodies produced from the first serotype can bind to the second serotype but fail to neutralize it. Instead, these antibodies enhance the infection by inhibiting immune responses, preventing B cell activation against the second serotype. Antibody-Dependent Enhancement (ADE): This phenomenon leads to the recruitment of mononuclear cells and cytokine release, contributing to increased severity of secondary dengue infections. Dengue fever (DF): It is characterized by: Abrupt onset of high fever (also called biphasic fever, break bone fever or saddleback fever) Maculopapular rashes over the chest and upper limbs Severe frontal headache Muscle and joint pains Lymphadenopathy Retro-orbital pain Loss of appetite, nausea and vomiting Rabies (Option B) is a viral infection transmitted through the bite or scratch of an infected animal. It is almost always fatal once the symptoms develop. Measles (Option C) is a highly contagious viral infection. Although reinfection with measles is possible, it does not typically lead to more severe disease or complications. Mumps (Option D) is a viral infection that primarily affects the parotid gland and salivary glands, leading to swelling and pain. Reinfection with mumps is rare.

      "explanation": "cell with multiple viruses results in the shuffling of gene segments to generate progeny viruses with novel genome combinations. Reassortment is exclusively seen in viruses with a segmented genome. It is defined as the exchange of intact genes within the entire segment, which occurs during confection. Orthomyxovirus (Influenza Virus) Segments and Structure: Genera: Includes influenza A, B, C, and D viruses. Genome Segments : Influenza A and B: Eight segments of negative-sense, single-stranded RNA. Influenza C and D: Seven segments (lacking the segment coding for neuraminidase). Shape and Size : Spherical, approximately 80–120 nm in diameter. Helical symmetry with a helical nucleocapsid enclosed in an envelope. Replication Site : Unique among RNA viruses, replication occurs in the nucleus. Viral Proteins : Structural Proteins : Polymerase proteins: PB1, PB2, and PA are responsible for RNA transcription and replication. Nucleoprotein (NP): Forms a ribonucleoprotein complex with viral RNA. Matrix proteins: M1 forms a shell beneath the envelope; M2 forms ion channels in the envelope. Glycoproteins: Hemagglutinin (HA) binds sialic acid receptors for viral entry; Neuraminidase (NA) aids in viral release and prevents virion aggregation. Non-structural Proteins : NS1 acts as an interferon antagonist. NS2 aids in nuclear export. Envelope : Lipid envelope containing HA and NA glycoproteins, which are essential for host cell entry and virus release. Hemagglutinin: Triangular-shaped peplomer. Binds to mucin or sialic acid receptors on respiratory epithelial cells. Facilitates viral entry into host cells. Neuraminidase: Mushroom-shaped and present in fewer numbers than HA. Sialidase enzyme that degrades sialic acid receptors on host cells. Facilitates release of virus particles from infected cell surfaces during budding. Prevents self-aggregation of virions to host cells. Helps the virus pass through the mucin layer in the respiratory tract to reach target epithelial cells.

This mosquito species, along with Aedes aegypti , plays a major role in the spread of Zika, as well as other viral infections like dengue and chikungunya . Zika virus: Zika virus (ZIKV) is an arbovirus from the Flaviviridae family, characterized by its single-stranded RNA. Transmission: ZIKV is primarily transmitted by the Aedes aegypti and Aedes albopictus mosquito. Other transmission modes include mother-to-child (especially in the first trimester), and rarely through sexual contact, blood transfusion, and organ transplantation. Clinical Manifestations: Incubation: A few days to 1 week; >80% of infections are asymptomatic. Zika Fever: Symptoms include mild fever, rash, and conjunctivitis. Congenital Zika Syndrome (CZS): Characterized by microcephaly and neurological issues. Neurological Complications: Rarely includes Guillain-Barré syndrome, neuropathy, and myelitis. Laboratory Diagnosis: Nucleic Acid Testing (NAT): RT-PCR is the preferred method, detecting ZIKV RNA in blood and urine up to 7 days after symptom onset. IgM Antibody Detection: Appears after 1 week of symptoms and can remain positive for several months; may cross-react with dengue antibodies. Enzyme Immunoassays (EIAs) and Immunofluorescence Assays (IFA): Used if symptoms last ≥ 7 days, utilizing viral lysate or recombinant proteins. Options A, C, and D are incorrect.

      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer B - CCR5 Explanation: CCR5 (C-C chemokine receptor type 5) is one of the primary receptors used by HIV (Human Immunodeficiency Virus) to enter host cells. Specifically, CCR5 is found on the surface of CD4+ T cells and other immune cells, and HIV binds to it along with CD4 (another receptor) in order to gain entry into the host cell. Modes of Transmission of HIV Sexual Transmission : Most common (75% of cases). Heterosexual Route: Male to female via vaginal intercourse is typical; risk per encounter is low (0.1–1%). Higher risk with anal intercourse. Blood Transfusion : Least common (5% of cases) but has a high transmission risk (90–95%). Percutaneous/Mucosal Transmission : Includes needle stick injuries and sharing razors; less effective compared to sexual transmission. Perinatal Transmission : 20–40% risk of mother-to-fetus transmission without intervention; highest risk during delivery. Casual Contact: No evidence of transmission through casual contact, kissing, or insect bites. Viral Load : Highest in blood, genital secretions, and cerebrospinal fluid; minimal in saliva and other body fluids. Saliva : Contains substances that may inhibit HIV transmission. Pathogenesis: Receptor Attachment Main Receptor: HIV binds its gp120 to the CD4 receptor on host cells, primarily expressed on helper T cells and other cells like monocytes and macrophages. Co-Receptors: Fusion requires a second receptor: CXCR4 : Found on T lymphocytes. CCR5 : Present on macrophage lineage cells. (Option B) DC-SIGN: A dendritic cell-specific receptor that binds HIV-1 but does not mediate entry; facilitates transport to lymphoid organs. CCR5 Delta 32 Mutation: Mutation can block HIV entry: Homozygous individuals are resistant to HIV (1% of Northern Europeans). Heterozygous individuals may have delayed progression to AIDS (10–15% of Europeans). Replication Options A, C, and D are incorrect.

Poxviruses Poxviruses are the largest viruses that infect vertebrates. Morphology Poxviruses measure approximately 400 nm in length and 230 nm in diameter, making them visible under a light microscope. Poxviruses are typically brick-shaped or ellipsoid. They possess an envelope consisting of two lipoprotein membranes (outer and inner), and the outer membrane features ridges. The envelope encases a core, along with two structures of unknown function known as lateral bodies. The core or nucleocapsid is biconcave and shaped like a dumbbell. Poxviruses contain a single linear double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) genome. They are unique among DNA viruses for replicating in the cytoplasm . Human-Important poxviruses Variola is the causative agent of smallpox, the first disease to be eradicated globally. Vaccinia : Used as a vaccine for smallpox. Molluscum contagiosum Virus : Causes warty lesions known as molluscum contagiosum. Genera classification Orthopoxvirus: Smallpox, monkeypox, vaccinia. Molluscipoxvirus: Molluscum contagiosum. Parapoxvirus: Milker’s nodules, bovine papular stomatitis viruses, etc. Capripoxvirus: Sheeppox, goatpox, lumpy skin disease, etc. Avipoxvirus: Fowlpox, pigeon pox, etc. Leporipoxvirus: Myxoma, hare fibroma, etc. Suipoxvirus: Swinepox virus. Yatapoxvirus: Tanapox, Yabapox viruses. Molluscum contagiosum Molluscum contagiosum virus is an obligate human poxvirus known for producing characteristic skin lesions. Clinical manifestations Lesions: Dome-shaped, pink, pearly wart-like lesions (2–5 mm in size) with a dimple at the center. Lesions can appear singly or in clusters, located anywhere on the body except on the palms and soles . Lesions are umbilicated. Genital lesions are commonly observed in adults. Lesions typically resolve on their own within 3–4 months. Transmission Primarily affects children, transmitted through direct and indirect contact (e.g., barbers, shared towels, swimming pools). Rare instances of sexual transmission have been reported in young adults. Laboratory diagnosis Molluscum bodies: Characteristic intracytoplasmic eosinophilic inclusions were observed in skin scrapings stained with histopathological stains. Confirmation methods: Electron microscopy PCR Cultivation: The virus cannot be propagated in tissue culture, embryonated eggs, or animals. Treatment Surgical removal of the lesions by ablation (by cryotherapy or laser therapy) is the mainstay of treatment. Cidofovir has been shown to have some efficacy. Options A, B, & C are incorrect.

      "explanation": "Correct Answer: A) Aedes aegypti Explanation: Zika virus is primarily transmitted to humans through the bite of Aedes mosquitoes, especially Aedes aegypti and Aedes albopictus. These mosquitoes are day-biters, with peak activity during early morning and late afternoon. Zika virus: Zika virus (ZIKV) is an arbovirus from the Flaviviridae family, characterized by its single-stranded RNA. Transmission: ZIKV is primarily transmitted by the Aedes aegypti mosquito. Other transmission modes include mother-to-child (especially in the first trimester), and rarely through sexual contact, blood transfusion, and organ transplantation. The life cycle of Zika virus Clinical Manifestations: Incubation: A few days to 1 week; >80% of infections are asymptomatic. Zika Fever: Symptoms include mild fever, rash, and conjunctivitis. Congenital Zika Syndrome (CZS): Characterized by microcephaly and neurological issues. Neurological Complications: Rarely includes Guillain-Barré syndrome, neuropathy, and myelitis. Laboratory Diagnosis: Nucleic Acid Testing (NAT): RT-PCR is the preferred method, detecting ZIKV RNA in blood and urine up to 7 days after symptom onset. IgM Antibody Detection: Appears after 1 week of symptoms and can remain positive for several months; may cross-react with dengue antibodies. Enzyme Immunoassays (EIAs) and Immunofluorescence Assays (IFA): Used if symptoms last ≥ 7 days, utilizing viral lysate or recombinant proteins. Phlebotomus (Option D): Transmits Leishmania spp. (causing leishmaniasis), not Zika virus. These are sandflies, different from mosquitoes.

        "D": "That the patient is in the window period"
      },
      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: A) Time of incubation Explanation: Antibody testing relies on the host's immune response, which takes time to develop. IgM antibodies appear around 7–10 days after infection, while IgG antibodies become detectable after 2–3 weeks, peaking in the convalescent phase. Thus, the timing of testing relative to symptom onset is critical. Incorrect Options: Presence of acute viral load (Option B): RT-PCR or antigen tests are used to detect acute viral load during early infection. Antibody tests do not detect active infection but indicate past exposure. A high risk of reinfection (Option C): While waning immunity and viral mutations can contribute to reinfection, antibody testing does not directly assess reinfection risk. That the patient is in the window period (Option D): The window period is the phase before detectable antibodies are produced. During this period, antibody tests may be falsely negative, making RT-PCR the preferred diagnostic method for early infection.

      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: C) Real-time RT-PCR Explanation: Real-time Reverse Transcription Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR) is the gold standard for measuring viral load, especially for RNA viruses like HIV, SARS-CoV-2, and HCV. It quantifies viral RNA in real-time, providing an accurate measure of infection severity and treatment response. Real-time PCR, also known as quantitative PCR (qPCR) , provides the advantage of quantifying DNA or RNA as the amplification process occurs in real time. This is achieved by measuring the fluorescence emitted by DNA-binding dyes or probes that are incorporated during the PCR amplification. Traditional PCR only allows for the detection of the PCR product at the end of the process, without the capability to quantify the initial amount of target nucleic acid. Uses of Real-Time PCR: Gene Expression Analysis Quantification of DNA or RNA Detection of Pathogens Genotyping Cancer Research Forensic Analysis Biotechnology Applications Incorrect Options: ELISA (Option A): Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA) detects viral antigens or antibodies but does not quantify viral RNA or DNA. It is commonly used for screening infections like HIV and hepatitis but is not suitable for viral load measurement. Western Blot (Option B) : Western blot is a confirmatory test for detecting specific viral proteins, such as in HIV diagnosis. However, it does not quantify viral genetic material, making it unsuitable for viral load assessment. Immunoelectrophoresis (Option D): Immunoelectrophoresis is used to separate and identify proteins (e.g., immunoglobulins in multiple myeloma) but does not measure viral load.

      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: C) PCR Explanation: Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) is the most commonly used and accurate diagnostic test for monkeypox . PCR tests can detect the DNA of the monkeypox virus in clinical samples, such as lesions, blood, or respiratory secretions, allowing for a precise diagnosis. Monkeypox infections The monkeypox virus belongs to the Orthopoxvirus genus . Monkeypox is a rare zoonotic infection first recognized in captive monkeys in 1958. Transmission Infection likely occurs through direct contact with wild animals . The exact primary reservoir host remains unidentified, but species such as squirrels, rabbits , and rodents can be infected. Clinical features Symptoms resemble those of smallpox but are generally milder. Fever and rash. Lymphadenopathy is a prominent feature in most cases, unlike in smallpox or chickenpox. Complications Respiratory distress Secondary bacterial infections Vaccination The vaccinia vaccine can offer protection against monkeypox or lessen its severity. Human-to-Human transmission Transmission between humans is considered limited. Estimates suggest that only about 15% of close contacts of infected individuals become infected. Diagnosis The CDC recommends the collection of two specimens, each from multiple lesions from different locations. Confirmed via isolation in viral culture or by PCR for mpox virus DNA from a patient specimen. Incorrect Options: ELISA (Option A) : While ELISA (Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay) can be used to detect antibodies or antigens, it is not the gold standard for diagnosing monkeypox. It may be used to detect antibodies in some cases but is not as definitive as PCR. Hemagglutination assay (Option B) : This test is used for detecting viruses like influenza or other viruses that cause red blood cell agglutination. It is not commonly used for diagnosing monkeypox. Hybrid Capture assay (Option D) : This is primarily used for detecting viral DNA, such as for HPV (Human Papillomavirus) infections, and is not used for monkeypox.",

      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: A) HSV-2 Explanation: The scenario of painful genital ulcers, flu-like symptoms, tender inguinal lymphadenopathy, and a history of multiple sexual partners is most likely indicative of a Herpes Simplex Virus Type 2 (HSV 2) infection. Genital lesions of HSV Mostly seen in HSV type 2. Bilateral, painful genital vesiculo-ulcerative lesions. Tender inguinal lymphadenopathy. Site: Lesions are mainly seen on, Males: The penis or in the urethra (urethritis). Females: The cervix, vagina, vulva and perineum It is associated with systemic features like fever (flu-like) and malaise. In pregnant females, a cesarean is preferred over normal labour to prevent vertical transmission. Molluscum (Option B): Molluscum contagiosum, caused by the Molluscum contagiosum virus, presents as painless, dome-shaped, umbilicated papules. It does not cause vesicular lesions or significant lymphadenopathy. HPV (Option C): Human papillomavirus (HPV) causes genital warts, which appear as painless, verrucous growths (condyloma acuminata). Unlike HSV-2, HPV does not present with painful vesicles or tender lymphadenopathy. HZV (Option D): Herpes zoster virus (HZV) causes painful vesicular eruptions following a dermatomal distribution. While it can affect the genital area (e.g., sacral zoster), it does not typically cause inguinal lymphadenopathy unless secondarily infected.",

      },
      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: C) Amoxiclav Explanation: Amoxicillin-clavulanate (Amoxiclav) is the preferred antibiotic for dog bite wounds because it provides broad coverage against Gram-positive, Gram-negative, and anaerobic bacteria, including Pasteurella multocida. Since the patient has a laceration, antibiotic prophylaxis is recommended to prevent secondary bacterial infections. Metronidazole (Option A): Metronidazole is effective against anaerobic bacteria but is not the first-line prophylactic treatment for dog bites, which often involve aerobic and anaerobic polymicrobial infections, including Pasteurella multocida, Staphylococcus aureus, and Streptococcus species. Ciprofloxacin (Option B): Ciprofloxacin is primarily effective against Gram-negative bacteria but has limited activity against Pasteurella multocida, a common pathogen in dog bites. It is not the preferred first-line antibiotic for animal bites. Observation (Option D): While observation is appropriate for minor scratches or superficial wounds in an immunized person, a laceration presents a higher risk of bacterial infection, warranting antibiotic prophylaxis.

      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: C) It is a Flavivirus Explanation: Rubella is caused by a Togavirus (Rubivirus genus), not a Flavivirus. Flaviviruses include Dengue, Yellow Fever, Zika, and West Nile Virus, whereas Rubella belongs to the Togaviridae family. CONGENITAL RUBELLA SYNDROME Definition Congenital rubella syndrome (CRS) occurs in infants who have contracted rubella from their mothers while in utero. The most likely time for this to occur is between 8-10 weeks of gestation. After birth, these babies can transmit the virus to others for a period of 12–18 months. Dermatological presentation Blueberry Muffin Rash (Option D ruled out) Forchheimer Spots- small, red or purple spots that can appear on the soft palate Ophthalmic Defects Cataracts Microphthalmia Glaucoma Salt and pepper retinopathy Chorioretinitis Auditory Defects Sensorineural deafness Cardiac Defects Peripheral pulmonary artery stenosis Patent ductus arteriosus Ventricular septal defects Craniofacial Defects Microcephaly Other Infant Presentations Meningoencephalitis Hepatosplenomegaly Thrombocytopenia Interstitial pneumonitis Radiolucency in the long bones Diagnosis Hemagglutination inhibition test (HAI) is the commonly preferred test. Presence of IgM antibodies shortly after birth. Presence of IgG antibodies lasting >6 months. IgM positive implies in-utero infection because IgM antibodies cannot pass from mother to child through the placenta. Blueberry muffin rash: Forchheimer Spots It is one of the teratogenic TORCH infections (Option A): Rubella is a part of the TORCH infections (Toxoplasmosis, Other [Syphilis, Varicella-Zoster, Parvovirus B19], Rubella, Cytomegalovirus, Herpes Simplex Virus), which can cause congenital defects if contracted during pregnancy. Causes maculopapular rash that starts on the face and spreads caudally to involve the trunk and extremities (Option B): Rubella presents with a mild maculopapular rash that begins on the face and then spreads downward to the trunk and extremities, similar to measles but less severe.",

        "D": "BK Nephropathy"
      },
      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: A) Aplastic crises in sickle cell disease Explanation: Aplastic crises in sickle cell disease are commonly triggered by Parvovirus B19 infection, which causes transient red cell aplasia. This is because Parvovirus B19 infects erythroid progenitor cells in the bone marrow, leading to a temporary halt in erythropoiesis. This virus causes cell lysis and depletion of erythroid precursors, leading to transient arrest of erythropoiesis , which exacerbates anemia in children with sickle cell disease . Clinical Manifestations and Complications of Parvovirus B19 Infection Low grade fever, malaise, URTI. Erythema infectiosum (Fifth Disease): Characterized by a \"slapped-cheek\" rash followed by a lacy, reticular rash on the body. Arthropathy: Common in adults, presenting as arthritis or arthralgia. Transient Aplastic Crisis: Severe anaemia in individuals with chronic hemolytic anaemia. Fetal Infection: Risk of nonimmune fetal hydrops and stillbirth typically results in normal deliveries. Papular purpural gloves and socks syndrome Myocarditis Immunodeficiency (Option B): While Parvovirus B19 can cause chronic anemia in immunocompromised individuals, immunodeficiency itself does not directly present as an acute aplastic crisis with a sudden drop in hemoglobin. Lymphoproliferative disorder (Option C): Lymphoproliferative disorders (e.g., leukemias, lymphomas) may present with pancytopenia, but they do not cause a transient aplastic crisis. They are also more likely to be associated with lymphadenopathy, hepatosplenomegaly, and abnormal white blood cell counts. BK Nephropathy (Option D): BK virus mainly affects renal transplant recipients or immunocompromised patients, leading to nephropathy and renal dysfunction, but it does not cause an aplastic crisis.",

      "explanation": "reaction (RT-PCR) is a highly sensitive and specific method for detecting viral RNA, including the RNA of the rabies virus. It can be used in various types of samples, including saliva, cerebrospinal fluid, skin biopsies, and corneal scrapings. It is therefore the most appropriate test for confirming a diagnosis of rabies. Incorrect Options: Option B - Viral culture: While viral culture can be used to diagnose many types of viral infections, it is not typically used for rabies due to the slow growth of the virus and the biohazard risk associated with culturing the rabies virus. Option C - Antibody detection by ELISA: ELISA (enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay) can be used to detect antibodies against the rabies virus in the patient's blood. However, it can take 1-2 weeks after the onset of symptoms for these antibodies to develop, so a negative result does not rule out rabies in the early stages of the disease. Option D - Direct fluorescent antibody test: This test is used to detect the presence of rabies virus in a sample (often a skin biopsy from the back of the neck) by staining it with fluorescent antibodies that bind to the virus. While it's a common method for diagnosing rabies, its sensitivity can be lower than RT-PCR, especially in corneal scrapings.

      "explanation": "Correct Answer: A) Virus Explanation: Interferon beta (IFN- β ) is produced by fibroblasts in response to viral infections, particularly when the body detects the presence of viral RNA or other viral components. Elevated levels of IFN- β are typically indicative of a viral infection because it plays a role in the innate immune response, helping to limit viral replication. Interferons (IFNs): Types : IFN- α : Produced by macrophages, has antiviral action. IFN- β : Produced by fibroblasts, also has antiviral action. IFN- γ : Produced by T helper cells, does not have antiviral action but plays a role in cell-mediated immunity (CMI). Mechanism of Action : IFNs do not directly act on viruses but stimulate host cells to produce proteins that inhibit protein synthesis and viral replication. Innate Immunity : IFNs are part of innate immunity, nonspecific, and produced quickly after infection (within hours). Unlike antibodies, they don’t have immunological memory. Inducers : IFN production is triggered by agents like RNA viruses (e.g., togaviruses, vesicular stomatitis virus), double-stranded RNA, bacterial endotoxin, and synthetic polymers. Preparations : Human IFNs : Prepared via DNA recombinant technology. Pegylated IFNs : IFN- α linked to polyethylene glycol, resulting in slower absorption, decreased clearance, and more sustained serum levels. Administered once a week. Clinical Applications : Topical : Used for rhinovirus infections, genital warts, and herpetic keratitis. Systemic : Used for chronic hepatitis B, C, and D infections. Antiproliferative Action : Used to treat cancers (e.g., hairy cell leukemia, Kaposi’s sarcoma) and autoimmune diseases (e.g., multiple sclerosis). Bacteria (Option B), Fungi (Option C), and Mycoplasma (Option D) : While infections caused by these pathogens may also trigger immune responses, they typically don't induce the production of interferon beta in the same way viruses do. Instead, bacterial infections often activate other components of the immune system, such as neutrophils and macrophages, and induce the release of cytokines like interleukin-1 or tumor necrosis factor (TNF), rather than IFN- β .

      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: C) CSF PCR for viral DNA Explanation: Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for HSV DNA in CSF is the gold standard for diagnosing HSV encephalitis due to its high sensitivity and specificity. HSV Encephalitis Herpesviruses: Large, double-stranded DNA viruses; 8 types affect humans (HHV-1 to HHV-8). HSV Types: HSV-1: Most common in adults & children; sporadic, non-seasonal. HSV-2: More common in neonates & immunocompromised individuals. Etiology Causative Agents: HSV-1 (90%), HSV-2 (10%). Structure: Enveloped, icosahedral, double-stranded DNA virus. Host Cell Entry: Via nectin-1 and HVEM receptors on neurons. Pathogenesis: Primary infection: HSV infects skin/mucosa, enters neurons, and travels retrogradely to ganglia. Latency: Controlled by immune mechanisms (histone deposition, cytokines). Reactivation: Can spread to CNS via trigeminal or olfactory nerves. Pathophysiology Transmission: Close contact; HSV-1 → oral, HSV-2 → genital. Brain Invasion Routes: Oropharyngeal infection → Trigeminal/Olfactory nerve spread. Reactivation in ganglia → CNS spread. Latent HSV in the brain reactivates. Affected Areas: Temporal lobes, limbic system → hemorrhagic necrosis. Immunosuppression Risks: Natalizumab, TNF- α inhibitors, whole-brain radiation. Clinical Presentation Prodrome: Fever, malaise, headache, nausea. Typical Features: CNS signs: Confusion, seizures, focal deficits, personality changes. Behavioral syndromes: Hypomania, Klüver-Bucy, amnesia. Other findings: Incontinence, dermatomal rash, Guillain-Barré syndrome. Neonatal HSE: Presents at 1–3 weeks with irritability, lethargy, poor feeding, tremors, seizures. Herpetic skin lesions, thrombocytopenia, liver dysfunction may be present. Immunocompromised Patients: Atypical/subtle presentation, fewer focal deficits. Histopathology Gross Findings: Hemorrhagic necrosis in medial temporal and inferior frontal lobes. Microscopic Findings: Early: Neuronal ischemia, capillary dilation. Cowdry type A inclusions: Eosinophilic intranuclear inclusions in neurons. Late (>3 weeks): Necrosis, gliosis, inflammation. Atypical in Immunocompromised: Less inflammation, persistent viral antigens. Evaluation CSF Analysis (Gold Standard): ↑ WBCs (lymphocytic pleocytosis), ↑ protein, normal glucose. HSV PCR: 96% sensitive, 99% specific. Repeat PCR if negative within 72 hours in high-suspicion cases. HSV IgM in CSF is useful if PCR is unavailable or delayed. Imaging: CT: Initial test; may be normal early, later shows hypodensities, hemorrhage. MRI (Best Test): Temporal lobe hyperintensities on T2/FLAIR, sparing basal ganglia. Other Tests: CBC, metabolic panel. HSV PCR in blood useful in neonates & immunocompromised. Incorrect Options: IgM in CSF (Option A): IgM detection is not reliable for diagnosing HSV encephalitis because antibody production is delayed, and false negatives are common in early infection. Tzanck smear of CSF (Option B): Tzanck smear is used for HSV skin and mucosal lesions but is not useful for diagnosing CNS infections. It detects multinucleated giant cells, which are not seen in CSF. CSF culture on chick embryo lines (Option D): HSV culture requires human cell lines (not chick embryos), and CSF cultures are rarely positive in encephalitis. Culture is not a reliable diagnostic method for CNS infections.",

      },
      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: A) Antigen detection in the stool sample Explanation: Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and latex agglutination tests are commonly used to detect rotavirus antigen (VP6 protein) in stool samples. This is the most sensitive and specific test for diagnosing rotavirus infection. Sandwich ELISA Procedure: Coating : Coat microtiter wells with goat anti-rotavirus antibody; add sample and incubate (overnight at 4°C or 2 hours at 37°C). Detection Antibody : Add enzyme-labelled anti-rotavirus antibody (e.g., with alkaline phosphatase) and incubate. Substrate Addition : Add para-nitrophenyl phosphate; enzyme activity causes colour change if rotavirus is present. Interpretation : Yellow colour development confirms a positive test; the ELISA reader provides quantitative colour readings. Incorrect Options: Antigen detection in blood (Option B): Rotavirus primarily affects the gastrointestinal tract and does not cause significant viremia; therefore, detecting antigens in blood is not a standard diagnostic method. Antibody detection in serum (Option C): While serology can detect past exposure to rotavirus, it is not useful for acute diagnosis, as antibodies appear later in the infection. Light microscopy of stool specimen (Option D): Routine light microscopy does not detect rotavirus, as the virus is too small to be seen. However, electron microscopy can visualize viral particles but is not routinely used due to cost and expertise requirements.",

      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: A) Cytomegalovirus Explanation: Cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection is associated with \"owl-eye\" intranuclear inclusions in infected cells, which are enlarged and found in urine, blood, or tissue biopsy. In neonates, congenital CMV can present with jaundice, hepatosplenomegaly, microcephaly, and petechial rash. In immunocompromised patients, CMV can cause retinitis, pneumonitis, and colitis. Cytomegalovirus General Characteristics Herpesvirus (HHV-5) , widespread prevalence. Often asymptomatic in healthy individuals but severe in immunocompromised and congenital infections. Remains latent post-infection and may reactivate . Linked to mucoepidermoid carcinoma and possibly prostate cancer . Transmission: Blood transfusions, organ transplantation, breastfeeding, close contact, perinatal, and sexual routes . Reactivation occurs in immunocompromised individuals, increasing morbidity and mortality . Pathophysiology Persists in myeloid cells , reactivates with immune suppression . Controlled mainly by cytotoxic T-cell immunity . Lifelong immune burden , affecting T-cell surveillance . Clinical Manifestations Immunocompetent patients: Often asymptomatic or mononucleosis-like syndrome (fever, rash, leukocytosis). Immunocompromised patients: Can cause severe organ-specific disease : CMV hepatitis → Risk of fulminant liver failure CMV retinitis → “ Pizza pie ” fundoscopic appearance CMV esophagitis, colitis, pneumonitis, polyradiculopathy, encephalitis, transverse myelitis Diagnosis Quantitative PCR : Preferred for viral detection. Histopathology (CMV inclusion bodies): Gold standard. Serology: Used for pre-transplant risk assessment but not for acute infection diagnosis . CMV-negative blood transfusions reserved for neonates and immunocompromised patients. Ganciclovir resistance testing is routine in transplant centers. Management Immunocompetent patients: Self-limiting, only symptomatic treatment required. Immunocompromised & severe cases: Require antivirals (ganciclovir, valganciclovir, foscarnet, cidofovir) . Prophylaxis: CMV-negative recipients of CMV-positive organ transplants should receive valganciclovir or ganciclovir with serological monitoring . Antiviral toxicity must be weighed against benefits. Incorrect Options: Epstein-Barr virus (Option B): Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) causes infectious mononucleosis, which presents with fever, pharyngitis, and lymphadenopathy. It is associated with atypical lymphocytes in blood smear, but not \"owl-eye\" inclusions in urine. Herpes simplex virus (Option C): Herpes simplex virus (HSV) causes painful vesicular lesions in the oral or genital region. It shows multinucleated giant cells with Cowdry type A inclusions on Tzanck smear, but not \"owl-eye\" inclusions. Toxoplasma gondii (Option D): Toxoplasma gondii causes congenital toxoplasmosis, which presents with chorioretinitis, hydrocephalus, and intracranial calcifications. It is a protozoan, and its cysts do not show \"owl-eye\" inclusions.

        "D": "Malaria"
      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: B) Dengue hemorrhagic fever Explanation: Dengue hemorrhagic fever is characterized by high fever, thrombocytopenia (<100,000/mm³), plasma leakage (leading to hemoconcentration, pleural effusion, or ascites), and hemorrhagic manifestations (petechiae, gum bleeding, or positive tourniquet test). The patient’s low platelet count (20,000/mm³) and petechiae confirm this diagnosis. Dengue complications Neurological Dengue encephalopathy is most commonly encountered neurological complication of dengue virus Linked primarily to dengue hemorrhagic fever and dengue shock syndrome EEG may show abnormalities such as burst suppression and seizures CSF profiles typically remain normal. Neuroimaging can be normal or reveal diffuse cerebral edema. Encephalitis GBS Stroke Cardiomyopathy Dengue virus-induced dilated cardiomyopathy should always be considered if a dengue fever patient has refractory shock and signs and symptoms of congestive heart failure. Hepatic injury Liver involvement in dengue is a crucial feature The effect ranges from an asymptomatic rise in liver enzymes to the development of ALF The most common atypical manifestation reported was hepatitis Pneumonia Staphylococcus pneumonia is an important accompanying problem seen in dengue patient Co-infection between dengue and influenza can result in exacerbation of pneumonia Orchitis Orchitis usually occurs together with epididymitis Commonly seen in men between 14 and 35 years of age. Dengue Hemorrhagic Fever All of the following: Acute onset of fever 2-7 days duration Hemorrhagic manifestations Positive tourniquet test/Petechiae Ecchymosis Purpura/Bleeding from mucosa, GIT, Injection sites, etc Platelet count ≤ 100,000 cells/cu.mm. Plasma leakage Rising hematocrit Hemoconcentration >20% Pleural effusion, ascites/Hypoproteinemia) Dengue Shock Syndrome DHF criteria plus Signs of Shock Tachycardia/Cool extremities/Weak pulse/Lethargy/Restlessness Pulse pressure <20 mm Hg with increased Diastolic pressure (e.g. 100/80) Hypotension (Systolic <80 mm Hg for age <5 years/80-90 mm Hg for older children and adults) Incorrect Options: Dengue fever (Option A): Classical dengue fever presents with fever, arthralgia, myalgia, retro-orbital pain, and rash but does not involve significant thrombocytopenia (<100,000/mm³) or plasma leakage. The presence of petechiae and a positive tourniquet test suggests progression to Dengue Hemorrhagic Fever (DHF). Dengue shock syndrome (Option C): Dengue shock syndrome is a severe complication of DHF, with hypotension, circulatory collapse, and organ failure. The absence of shock symptoms (low BP, tachycardia, cold extremities, altered sensorium) rules out DSS. Malaria (Option D): Malaria presents with cyclic fevers, chills, sweating, and anemia. While severe Plasmodium falciparum infection can cause thrombocytopenia, petechial rash and a positive tourniquet test are not typical findings.

A skin biopsy sample taken from the nape of the neck with at least 10 hair follicles is the best specimen, and it is stained with fluorescent antibodies specific to the rabies virus. If the virus is present, it will bind to the antibodies and produce a fluorescence, confirming the diagnosis of rabies. Incorrect Options: Option B - Rabies Virus Specific Antibodies: Testing for rabies virus-specific antibodies in the patient's blood is not a suitable method for diagnosis of rabies. The presence of antibodies in blood appears late and is present in both rabies-infected and immunized individuals. CSF antibodies appear early, and they are produced only in rabies-infected individuals but not in response to vaccination Option C - Inoculation in Mice: Inoculation in mice helps in the isolation of the virus. It involves injecting the patient's tissue sample into a live mouse and observing for signs of rabies infection in the mouse. This method is time-consuming and may not provide rapid results. Option D - Corneal Impression Smear: Corneal impression smear is another method used for diagnosing rabies via direct fluorescent antibody testing, but with a low sensitivity of 30%.

The age group of 5-12 years is generally considered to have a lower risk compared to these high-risk groups. Incorrect Options: Option A - Secondary Attack rate is 5-15%: The secondary attack rate refers to the proportion of susceptible individuals who develop the disease after being exposed to an infected individual. In the case of influenza, the secondary attack rate can vary depending on factors such as the specific strain, population density, and level of immunity. Generally, the secondary attack rate for influenza is estimated to be around 5 to 15%. Option B - Intranasal Live Attenuated Vaccine is used: Intranasal live attenuated vaccine, a trivalent vaccine H1N1 (A), H3N2 (A), type B is indicated for individuals with influenza infection, contraindicated in low immunity. Option D - Aquatic Birds act as Reservoir: Aquatic birds, particularly wild waterfowl, are considered the natural reservoir for influenza viruses.

        "D": "UL54 mutated CMV strains do not show cross resistance to Foscarnet"
      },
      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "Ganciclovir is a nucleoside DNA polymerase inhibitor an antiviral drug commonly used for the treatment of CMV infections. Resistance to ganciclovir can occur due to mutations in the UL97 and UL54 gene of CMV. Ganciclovir is converted by viral phosphotransferase encoded by the CMV UL97 gene to form ganciclovir triphosphate that inhibits CMV DNA polymerase. Mutations in the UL97 gene can result in reduced phosphorylation of ganciclovir, leading to decreased efficacy of the drug and the development of resistance. Incorrect Options: Option B - CMV can be cultured in vitro in any mammalian cell: Human fibroblasts are the most specific and ideal cell lines for the isolation of the cytomegalovirus. Option C - The commonest manifestation of CMV-associated disease is watery diarrhea: CMV is the most common infection associated with congenital defects. In Immunocompetent individuals, after transplantation, it causes mononucleosis-like disease, and in immunocompromised individuals (HIV/transplantation), it causes, most commonly, CMV retinitis. Option D - UL54 mutated CMV strains do not show cross-resistance to Foscarnet: UL54 refers to the DNA polymerase gene of CMV, which is the target of antiviral drugs like ganciclovir and foscarnet, and mutation in this gene can lead to resistance against ganciclovir, foscarnet, and cidofovir.

      "explanation": "Influenza virus. Influenza virus is an RNA virus that belongs to the Orthomyxoviridae family. Its replication process involves several distinct steps: Attachment: The spikes of hemagglutinin bind to sialic acid found on the surface of the host cell’s membrane. Entry: The virus enters the host cell by endocytosis, which involves the engulfment of the virus particle by the cell membrane and the formation of a vesicle called an endosome. Fusion: The viral envelope fuses with the endosomal membrane, and the M2 ion channel allows entry of H+ ions - H+ influx, resulting in uncoating and releasing the viral genetic material into the host cell's cytoplasm. Replication: The viral RNA serves as a template for the synthesis of new viral RNA segments (turning negative sense RNA into positive sense RNA), as well as viral proteins. The viral RNA polymerase, which is carried by the virus, is responsible for replicating and transcribing the viral RNA. Assembly: Newly synthesized viral RNA segments and proteins are assembled into new virus particles within the host cell. Budding: The assembled virus particles bud from the host cell's plasma membrane, acquiring an envelope derived from the host cell membrane. This process allows the virus to be released by neuraminidase and potentially infect other cells. Incorrect Options: Options A, C, and D are incorrect. Refer to Option B for an explanation.

      "explanation": "of influenza typically include young children (especially those under 2 years), the elderly (65 years and older), pregnant women, individuals with underlying health conditions, and immunocompromised individuals. The age group of 5-12 years is generally considered to have a lower risk compared to these high-risk groups. Incorrect Options: Option A - Intranasal Live attenuated vaccine is used: Intranasal live attenuated vaccine, a trivalent vaccine H1N1 (A), H3N2 (A), type B is indicated for individuals with influenza infection, contraindicated in low immunity. Option C - Aquatic birds act as reservoir: Aquatic birds, particularly wild waterfowl, are considered the natural reservoir for influenza viruses. They can carry different strains of influenza viruses, including avian influenza viruses, without showing symptoms. These viruses can occasionally cross over to infect other species, including humans. Option D - Secondary attack rate is 5-15%: The secondary attack rate refers to the proportion of susceptible individuals who develop the disease after being exposed to an infected individual. In the case of influenza, the secondary attack rate can vary depending on factors such as the specific strain, population density, and level of immunity. Generally, the secondary attack rate for influenza is estimated to be around 5 to 15%. Reference: Prepladder Notes",

Antemortem diagnosis of rabies can be made by rabies antigen detection by performing a corneal impression smear, skin biopsy from the nape of the neck containing at least 10 hair follicles, and saliva. The viral antigens are present in these preparations and are examined for their presence using techniques like direct fluorescent antibody (DFA) testing. Incorrect Options: Option A - Rabies Virus Specific Antibodies: While the presence of rabies virus-specific antibodies can indicate a past infection or immune response, it is not a reliable method for antemortem diagnosis. Antibodies may take time to develop and may not be detectable during the early stages of infection. Option B - Inoculation in Cell Lines: Inoculation of samples in cell lines is a method used for viral isolation and growth but is not commonly used for antemortem diagnosis of rabies. It is a time-consuming process and requires specific laboratory facilities. Option C - Negri Bodies in Hippocampus: Negri bodies are characteristic microscopic inclusion bodies found in certain neurons of the central nervous system affected by rabies virus infection. However, their detection usually requires brain tissue examination postmortem (after death) and is not feasible for antemortem diagnosis. Reference: Prepladder Notes",
