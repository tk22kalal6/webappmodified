      },
      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: A) High levels of interleukin-2 receptors in peripheral blood Explanation: HTLV-1 infection leads to elevated interleukin-2 receptors on infected T cells, which is associated with ATL. Human T-Cell Leukemia Virus Type 1 (HTLV-1) Retroviral Classification : Classified as a retrovirus with antigens on its envelope (type-specific glycoproteins) and core (group-specific nucleoproteins). Associated Conditions: Linked to adult T-cell leukaemia/lymphoma, cutaneous T-cell lymphoma, and tropical spastic paraparesis, a demyelinating condition. Contains an oncogenic Tax gene, promoting malignancy. Target Cells and Infection : Preferentially infects T4 (CD4) cells.uses GLUT1 (glucose transporter protein-1) on CD4 cells for attachment. Infected cells express high levels of interleukin-2 receptors. (Option A) Transmission : Primarily mother-to-child via breast milk, but also sexual contact (especially male-to-female) and infected blood. Genomic Structure and Antigens : Contains gag, pol, and env genes: Gag : Codes for nucleocapsid core proteins (group-specific antigens). Pol : Encodes RNA-dependent DNA polymerase. Env : Encodes envelope glycoproteins. Has a transactivating gene ( tax/tat ) that regulates viral gene expression. Host Specificity : Infects mainly one host species, depending on specific receptors on host cells. Cloverleaf cells or Flower cells -pathognomonic of HTLV-induced adult T cell leukaemia (ATL) Detection of p24 antigen in serum (Option B) : Incorrect, as p24 antigen detection is specific for HIV, not HTLV-1. Presence of CD4+ T cells in the peripheral blood (Option C): While HTLV-1 infects CD4+ T cells, their presence alone does not indicate ATL; rather, it's the transformation and malignancy that are of concern. Detection of GLUT1 on the surface of leukemic cells (Option D) : While GLUT1 is used by HTLV-1 for attachment to CD4 cells, its presence alone does not confirm ATL and is not a specific diagnostic marker.

      "question": "A 30 y/o man presents to the clinic with flu-like symptoms 12 days after potential exposure to HIV. The clinician suspects acute HIV infection and orders a diagnostic test. Which test would be most appropriate to confirm the infection at this early stage and provide insights into the viral load?",
      "options": {
        "A": "p24 Antigen Detection",
        "B": "HIV Antibody Test",
        "C": "RT-PCR",
        "D": "HIV DNA PCR"
      },
      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: C) RT-PCR Explanation: RT-PCR is the most appropriate test as it detects HIV RNA as early as 10-14 days post-exposure and quantifies viral load, providing critical information for early diagnosis and monitoring. RT-PCR for HIV Diagnosis and Monitoring Principle : Reverse transcription–polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) quantifies HIV RNA, measuring the viral load by directly estimating the number of HIV virions in a blood sample. Applications : Confirmation During Window Period : Detects HIV earlier than other methods, as early as 10–14 days post-exposure. Viral Load Monitoring : Used after an initial diagnosis to monitor HIV progression and response to antiretroviral therapy (ART). Typing and Subtyping : Differentiates between HIV-1 and HIV-2 and can detect specific genotypes/subtypes. Detection of Drug Resistance Genes : Assesses viral mutations associated with resistance to ART. Limitations : Costly and Technically Demanding : Not used routinely for screening due to high cost and complexity. p24 Antigen Detection (Option A): While this test can detect HIV earlier than antibody tests (12-26 days post-infection), it may not be as reliable in quantifying viral load as RT-PCR. HIV Antibody Test (Option B): This test typically detects antibodies that develop later (usually 2-8 weeks post-infection), making it unsuitable for confirming early infection. HIV DNA PCR (Option D): This test is primarily used for pediatric HIV diagnosis and not for early detection in adults, making it less relevant in this scenario.

      "question": "A 32-year-old woman receives a positive HIV screening test result. To confirm the diagnosis, the healthcare provider decides to use a supplemental test for validation due to its high specificity in detecting individual antibodies against various HIV antigens. Which of the following tests would be most appropriate for confirming the diagnosis in this case?",
      "options": {
        "A": "p24 Antigen Detection",
        "B": "HIV RNA Detection (RT-PCR)",
        "C": "Western Blot",
        "D": "HIV DNA Detection"
      },
      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: C) Western Blot Explanation: The Western Blot test is a supplemental HIV test recommended for confirming positive HIV screening results. It detects individual antibodies to HIV-specific proteins, offering a high level of specificity in confirming HIV infection, especially in cases where the initial screening test was positive. Western Blot for HIV Diagnosis Principle : Uses an immunoblot technique to detect antibodies in serum against specific HIV antigenic fragments (e.g., gag, pol, env gene products). Antigen-antibody complexes appear as distinct bands on a nitrocellulose strip. Detection of HIV Antibodies : Gag gene products : p55, p40, p24, p18. Pol gene products : p65/66, p55/51, p31. Env gene products : gp120, gp160, gp41. Criteria for Interpreting Results : WHO Criteria : Requires the presence of at least two envelope bands (gp120, gp160, or gp41) with or without gag or pol bands. CDC Criteria : Requires presence of any two of the following bands: p24, gp120, gp160, or gp41. Applications : Highly specific antibody detection method. Used for validation after initial screening. Expensive, laborious and may give indeterminate results. Confirmatory Tests for HIV Diagnosis p24 Antigen Detection: Detectable 12–26 days post-infection, elevated in late-stage HIV/AIDS, used for diagnosis during the window period, late-stage HIV, infants, and monitoring progression. Viral RNA Detection (Gold Standard): Detects HIV RNA 10–14 days post-exposure, highly sensitive and specific, used for confirmation during the window period, viral load monitoring, differentiation of HIV-1 and HIV-2, and drug resistance detection. HIV DNA Detection: Identifies proviral DNA, which is especially useful for pediatric diagnosis and differentiating latent from active infections. Virus Isolation: This time-consuming method is used mainly for research, involving the co-cultivation of patient’s cells with healthy donor cells to detect viral RNA or antigen. Non-specific Tests: CD4 T cell count assesses immune function and monitors response to antiretroviral therapy; abnormal protein markers indicate immune response to HIV. p24 Antigen Detection (Option A): The p24 antigen test is generally used in early detection and may assist in diagnosis when antibodies are not yet detectable. However, it lacks the specificity needed for confirmatory testing, as p24 levels can fluctuate and are often undetectable once antibodies have formed. HIV RNA Detection-RT-PCR (Option B): While extremely sensitive, it is typically not used as a confirmatory test for HIV antibodies because it focuses on viral RNA rather than antibody presence, which is what screening tests initially detect. HIV DNA Detection (Option D) is particularly useful in pediatric cases or to identify latent infection in adults. However, like RNA detection, it is not routinely used for confirmatory antibody testing following a positive HIV screening result in adults.

      },
      "correct_answer": "D",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: D) No further testing is needed; confirm HIV-1 infection. Explanation: The combination of a positive fourth-generation HIV-1/2 immunoassay and a positive HIV-1 result on the differentiation immunoassay confirms an established HIV-1 infection without the need for further testing. . CDC Guidelines for 4th Generation ELISA Screening Assays for HIV Detection General Detection Methods : Detect antibodies (via ELISA/EIA, CIA, particle agglutination). Detect p24 antigen or viral nucleic acid. Generations of EIA : First Generation : Detects antibodies against whole-cell lysate from infected cells. Second Generation : Uses recombinant-produced HIV antigens instead of whole-cell lysate. Third Generation : Utilizes the \"antigen sandwich\" method to detect both IgG and IgM, allowing for earlier antibody detection. Fourth Generation : Coats wells with p24 antibodies and HIV-1 antigens; detects p24 antigen or antibodies with enzyme-labeled antibodies. Fifth Generation : Quantifies HIV antibodies and p24 separately. Order a Western Blot for HIV-1 to confirm antibodies (Option A) : Incorrect, as Western Blot is no longer recommended for confirmation; the HIV-1 differentiation immunoassay has replaced it in current protocols. Perform an HIV-1 NAT (Nucleic Acid Test) (Option B) : Incorrect, since NAT is generally used to confirm acute infection when initial results are inconclusive, which isn’t the case here. Perform a repeat fourth-generation immunoassay (Option C) : Incorrect, as repeating the initial screening test isn’t necessary when the antibody differentiation assay has already confirmed HIV-1 antibodies.

      "explanation": "individuals. Correct Answer: D) The CCR5 Delta 32 mutation can confer resistance to HIV in homozygous individuals. Explanation: Individuals who are homozygous for the CCR5 Delta 32 mutation have a genetic resistance to HIV, making it difficult for the virus to enter their cells. Modes of Transmission of HIV Sexual Transmission : Most common (75% of cases). Heterosexual Route: Male to female via vaginal intercourse is typical; risk per encounter is low (0.1–1%). Higher risk with anal intercourse. Blood Transfusion : Least common (5% of cases) but has a high transmission risk (90–95%). (Option A ruled out) Percutaneous/Mucosal Transmission : Includes needle stick injuries and sharing razors; less effective compared to sexual transmission. Perinatal Transmission : 20–40% risk of mother-to-fetus transmission without intervention; highest risk during delivery. Casual Contact: No evidence of transmission through casual contact, kissing, or insect bites. Viral Load : Highest in blood, genital secretions, and cerebrospinal fluid; minimal in saliva and other body fluids. (Option C ruled out) Saliva : Contains substances that may inhibit HIV transmission. Pathogenesis: Receptor Attachment Main Receptor: HIV binds its gp120 to the CD4 receptor on host cells, primarily expressed on helper T cells and other cells like monocytes and macrophages. (Option B ruled out) Co-Receptors: Fusion requires a second receptor: CXCR4 : Found on T lymphocytes. CCR5 : Present on macrophage lineage cells. DC-SIGN: A dendritic cell-specific receptor that binds HIV-1 but does not mediate entry; facilitates transport to lymphoid organs. CCR5 Delta 32 Mutation: (Option D) Mutation can block HIV entry: Homozygous individuals are resistant to HIV (1% of Northern Europeans). Heterozygous individuals may have delayed progression to AIDS (10–15% of Europeans).

The presence of mild abdominal tenderness and leukopenia further supports the diagnosis, indicating potential complications associated with the disease. NS1 Antigen Detection is the most appropriate test at this stage, as it can be detected from day 1 of fever and is specific to dengue. It helps in early diagnosis before antibodies have developed.

Antibody Detection: IgM (Primary Infection): Appears after 5 days; MAC-ELISA is the recommended test. IgG (Secondary Infection): Rapid rise; may cross-react with other flaviviruses. Neutralization Tests: Plaque reduction and microneutralization tests; specific but complex, mostly used in research. Rapid Diagnostic Tests (RDTs): Detects IgM or NS1 antigen but has limited sensitivity; ELISA confirmation is required for a positive result. Virus Isolation: Virus detectable in blood up to 5 days post-symptoms; performed in research/reference centres. Molecular Methods (RT-PCR): Detects viral RNA from day -1 to +5; is highly sensitive and specific, and also helps in serotyping. Treatment: There is no specific antiviral therapy; supportive care includes plasma replacement, correction of electrolyte imbalances, and platelet transfusions as needed. Outpatient Management (no warning signs): Administer acetaminophen. Encourage sufficient oral fluid intake. Inpatient Management (with warning signs or severe dengue): Initiate IV crystalloids; adjust the fluid rate based on patient response. For shock not responding to crystalloid boluses, consider colloids. Blood Transfusion: Indicated in cases of severe or suspected bleeding if unstable despite fluid resuscitation and hematocrit falls. Consider platelet transfusion if the platelet count is below 20,000 cells/µL with high bleeding risk. Vaccine (CYD-TDV - Dengvaxia): Live-attenuated, tetravalent vaccine; indicated for ages 9-45 with prior dengue infection. Administered in 3 doses over six months; effective (~80%) in reducing hospitalized cases in high-prevalence regions. WHO advises use only in previously infected individuals due to potential risks for severe dengue in dengue-naive recipients. IgG Antibody Detection (Option B): IgG antibodies indicate a secondary infection and appear later than the NS1 antigen. This test would not be suitable for early diagnosis in this acute phase of illness. Virus Isolation (Option C): While virus isolation can confirm dengue infection, it is generally performed in specialized research centres and is not practical for immediate diagnosis in clinical settings. Rapid Diagnostic Test (Option D): Although RDTs can detect IgM or NS1 antigen, they have limited sensitivity and require confirmation with ELISA. Therefore, they are less reliable for initial diagnosis compared to NS1 antigen detection",

      "explanation": "Correct Answer: A) Dengue Explanation: The given clinical manifestations of fever, headache, muscle and joint pains, and maculopapular rashes and the corresponding lab results confirm the diagnosis of Dengue fever. Dengue virus: Dengue virus (DENV) is the most common arbovirus in India, belonging to the Flaviviridae family. It is an enveloped virus with single-stranded RNA (ssRNA). DENV has four serotypes (DEN-1 to DEN-4), with a fifth serotype (DEN-5) discovered in 2013 in Bangkok. Vector: Vectors : Aedes aegypti (main) and Aedes albopictus; both bite during the day. Feeding Behavior : A. aegypti is a nervous feeder, bites multiple hosts for blood meals, and resides in domestic areas, making it more efficient. Infectivity : Aedes becomes infective after feeding on viremic patients (1 day before to end of the febrile period, ~5 days). Extrinsic Incubation : Takes 8–10 days for Aedes to become infective; remains infective for life once infected. Transovarial Transmission : Aedes can pass dengue virus to offspring. Transmission Cycle : Humans and Aedes are the main reservoirs; the four serotypes do not involve other animals, while the fifth serotype follows a sylvatic cycle. The sylvatic cycle of dengue involves the transmission of the dengue virus between non-human primates (monkeys) and forest mosquitoes (e.g., Aedes aegypti , Aedes albopictus ) in tropical jungles. It acts as a natural reservoir, ensuring the virus's survival even during low human transmission periods. Human encroachment into forested areas can cause spillover, initiating urban transmission. Pathogenesis: Primary Dengue Infection: Occurs upon first infection with any one dengue serotype. Secondary Dengue Infection: Results from infection with a different serotype than the one involved in the primary infection. Antibody Response Against Dengue Virus : Dengue virus infection induces both neutralizing and non-neutralizing antibodies. Neutralizing Antibodies: Protective and produced against the infective serotype (lasting for life) and other serotypes (temporary cross-protection). Protection Duration: Lifelong protection against the infective serotype, while cross-protection to other serotypes diminishes over a few months. Non-Neutralizing Antibodies: Last for life and are heterotypic, produced against other serotypes but not the infective ones. During a secondary dengue infection, antibodies produced from the first serotype can bind to the second serotype but fail to neutralize it. Instead, these antibodies enhance the infection by inhibiting immune responses, preventing B cell activation against the second serotype. Antibody-Dependent Enhancement (ADE): This phenomenon leads to the recruitment of mononuclear cells and cytokine release, contributing to increased severity of secondary dengue infections. Dengue fever (DF): It is characterized by: Abrupt onset of high fever (also called biphasic fever, break bone fever or saddleback fever) Maculopapular rashes",

      },
      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: A) Yellow fever, 17D Explanation: The patient's clinical features and lab investigations suggest acute viral hepatitis with hemorrhagic features, which is characteristic of Yellow Fever . Vaccination with the 17D yellow fever vaccine can prevent the disease. Yellow fever diagnosis: Serology Test: IgM ELISA can be performed 3 days after symptom onset. Limitations: May yield false positives in other flavivirus infections (e.g., dengue, West Nile, Zika). False positives can occur in individuals vaccinated within the last 30 days. Confirmation: Positive results should be confirmed with a specific test (e.g., plaque-reduction neutralization test). Molecular Method Test: RT-PCR detects specific viral RNA (NS5 region) in blood. It is more reliable than serology. Timing: This should be performed within 10 days of symptom onset; RNA becomes undetectable beyond this period. Yellow fever 17D vaccine: Live attenuated vaccine prepared in the allantoic cavity of chick embryos. Safety: No risk of encephalitis Cold Chain Requirements: A strict cold chain must be maintained during transport at temperatures between -30°C and +5 °C. Available in lyophilized form, requiring reconstitution before use. Typically reconstituted with physiological saline. Should be used within 30 minutes of reconstitution. Dosage and Efficacy: Administered as a single subcutaneous dose. Effective within 7 days of administration, with immunity lasting up to 35 years. Vaccine Interaction: Cholera and yellow fever vaccines should not be administered together; maintain a 3-week interval. Contraindications: Children under 9 months (under 6 months during epidemics) Pregnancy (except during outbreaks) Individuals with HIV People with egg allergies Torres bodies: Intracytoplasmic inclusion bodies seen inside hepatocytes in yellow fever on HPE. Measles, Edmonston Zagreb (Option B): The diagnosis is yellow fever (YF), not measles, due to factors such as YF's endemicity in South America and the patient's severe abdominal pain, jaundice, and bleeding typical of YF, whereas measles causes respiratory symptoms and a rash. The measles vaccine uses the Edmonston strain, with variations like the Moraten and Schwartz strain, underscoring that the clinical presentation aligns with YF rather than measles. Mumps, Jeryll-Lynn (Option C): YF is endemic to South America, and the patient's severe abdominal pain, jaundice, and bleeding indicate liver dysfunction typical of YF, while mumps primarily cause parotitis and respiratory symptoms. The mumps vaccine uses the Jeryl Lynn strain , and the YF vaccination is specifically recommended for travellers to endemic regions, making YF the appropriate diagnosis. Rubella, RA 27/3 (Option D): YF is endemic to South America, while rubella is not. The patient's severe abdominal pain, jaundice, and bleeding indicate liver dysfunction typical of YF, whereas rubella primarily presents with a mild rash and fever. The rubella vaccine uses the RA 27/3 strain , and the YF vaccination is recommended for travellers to endemic areas, reinforcing YF as the correct diagnosis.",

      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: A) Aedes aegypti Explanation: The given clinical scenario is Yellow fever (YF) and the vector responsible for transmitting the disease is Aedes aegypti. General points: YF is an acute febrile illness. Virus Taxonomy: The YF virus is an enveloped ssRNA arbovirus in the Flaviviridae family. Geography: Endemic in West Africa and Central South America; not found in India. Genotypes: At least seven genotypes were identified, but only one serotype exists antigenically. Transmission of YF: Vector: Aedes aegypti (tiger mosquito). Transmission Cycles: Jungle Cycle: Involves transmission between monkeys and forest mosquitoes. Urban Cycle: Involves transmission between humans and urban mosquitoes (Aedes aegypti). Clinical Manifestations of YF: Incubation Period: 3-6 days. Early Stage (Febrile Illness): Symptoms: Fever, chills, headache, dizziness, myalgia, backache, followed by nausea, vomiting, and relative bradycardia. Viremic stage: The patient can infect mosquitoes. Severe Cases: Hemorrhagic manifestations. Platelet dysfunction. Liver involvement: Mid-zonal necrosis, Presence of councilman bodies, Jaundice. Renal dysfunction. Rarely, encephalitis. Mortality Rate: High (>20%), especially among children and the elderly. Female anopheles (Option B): The symptoms indicate yellow fever, transmitted by Aedes aegypti mosquitoes, which thrive in urban settings. In contrast, Anopheles mosquitoes primarily transmit Malaria and are not involved in yellow fever transmission. The specific clinical features, such as hemorrhagic manifestations and liver necrosis, confirm the role of Aedes aegypti as the vector for this disease. Culex (Option C): The clinical features suggest yellow fever, which is transmitted by Aedes aegypti mosquitoes, not Culex. Culex primarily transmits diseases like Japanese encephalitis and West Nile virus . Additionally, Aedes aegypti feeds during the day and breeds in clean, standing water f ound in artificial containers, whereas Culex mosquitoes are more nocturnal and prefer polluted, stagnant water. Mansonia (Option D): The clinical features indicate yellow fever, transmitted by Aedes aegypti, not Mansonia. Aedes aegypti is specifically known for yellow fever transmission, while Mansonia primarily transmits filarial infections . Thus, Aedes aegypti is the vector responsible for yellow fever.

      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Correct answer: C) Pigs Explanation: The clinical features of fever, confusion, seizures, and geographical information of the rural area in India and rice fields, with an age below 15 years point to probable Japanese Encephalitis infection. Pigs are considered the main amplifier hosts for the JE virus. The virus can replicate extensively in them, resulting in high levels of viraemia. This abundance of the virus in pigs makes them critical in transmitting it to mosquitoes, spreading it to other hosts. Two transmission cycles are predominant in Japanese encephalitis: Pigs → Culex mosquito → Pigs Ardeid birds → Culex mosquito → Ardeid birds Humans, when afflicted are considered to be a dead end and there is no “Man → mosquito → man” cycle Japanese Encephalitis Virus Vector Clinical features Culex mosquitoes, particularly Culex tritaeniorhynchus and Culex vishnui (common in India). Breeding Habitats: These mosquitoes thrive in rice fields and stagnant water, especially in rural regions. Incubation Period: Typically 5-15 days. Many infections are asymptomatic or subclinical. Stages of Disease: Prodromal Stage: Initial fever and flu-like symptoms. Acute Encephalitis Stage: High fever, neurological symptoms (confusion, seizures, stiff neck). Late Stage and Sequelae: Potential for full recovery or long-term neurological complications. Age Distribution: Primarily affects children under 15, significantly impacting young children. Geographical Distribution: Endemic across South East Asia JE Life cycle Humans (Option A): Humans act as incidental and dead-end hosts for the JE virus. The virus does not replicate to levels sufficient for transmission through mosquitoes, meaning infected individuals do not contribute to the spread of the virus. Cattle (Option B): Cattle can become infected with the JE virus, however, they do not play a role in the virus's natural transmission cycle and are not amplifier hosts. Birds (Option D): Ardeid birds, such as herons and egrets, are part of the natural transmission cycle of the JE virus, as they can become infected and allow mosquitoes to acquire the virus. However, they are not the primary amplifier hosts.

      },
      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Correct answer: C) IgM Antibody Detection Explanation: IgM Antibody Detection is most helpful for diagnosing active rubella infection, as the presence of IgM antibodies indicates a recent infection . In pregnant women, a positive IgM result raises concerns about potential congenital rubella syndrome in the foetus, making it a primary diagnostic tool. RT PCR is also another method for detecting rubella-specific RNA. Vaccine and Prophylaxis Vaccine Type : Live attenuated vaccines - RA 27/3 strain is standard for rubella immunization. Administration : Given subcutaneously, either alone or as part of the MMR (measles, mumps, rubella) vaccine. Target Populations : All children should be vaccinated to prevent rubella spread. Women of childbearing age should be prioritized for vaccination to avoid congenital rubella syndrome (CRS). Contraindications : Pregnant women should not be vaccinated due to risks to the fetus. Pregnancy should be avoided up to 3 months after vaccination. Immunocompromised individuals should avoid vaccination due to potential complications. IgG Avidity Test (Option A): This test assesses the strength of binding between IgG antibodies and rubella antigens, helping to differentiate between recent and past infections, the older the Ab, higher the avidity. However, it is not the first-line test for diagnosing an acute rubella infection. Virus Isolation (Option B): While this method can confirm rubella infection, it is not commonly employed due to the complexities and time delays involved in isolating the virus. It is more practical for specific cases, such as congenital rubella, rather than acute scenarios. TORCH Panel (Option D): The TORCH panel screens for various congenital infections, including rubella. While it can help identify multiple infections, it is not the first choice for diagnosing current rubella infection.

Their presence can serve as a clinical indicator to support the diagnosis of rubella in a child. Rubella, or German measles , is a mild, self-limiting illness caused by the rubella virus from the Rubivirus genus in the Togaviridae family. It is a ss-RNA virus acquired through inhalation, the incubation period is 2-3 weeks. Symptoms generally include low-grade fever, rash, upper respiratory symptoms and lymphadenopathy. Blueberry muffin rash (Option A): This rash is associated with congenital rubella syndrome, which presents in newborns as petechiae, particularly those that resemble blueberries, due to thrombocytopenia. It is not a characteristic finding in older children. Image showing Blueberry muffin rash Ocular defects (Option C): Ocular issues su6ts can be seen in congenital rubella syndrome but are not relevant to diagnosing rubella in postnatal cases. Patent ductus arteriosus (Option D): This cardiac condition is a potential complication of congenital rubella syndrome, which arises due to maternal infection during pregnancy.

      "question": "A 58-year-old woman presents with fever, severe joint pain in the wrist and ankle, and a faint rash. She reports mosquito bites over the past week while visiting a tropical region. Given these symptoms and recent exposure history, which test result would most likely confirm the suspected viral infection?",
      "options": {
        "A": "Detection of IgG antibodies in the first week",
        "B": "Presence of IgM antibodies in serum in the first two days",
        "C": "Detection of viral RNA by RT-PCR",
        "D": "Positive blood culture for chikungunya virus"
      },
      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Correct answer: C) Detection of viral RNA by RT-PCR Explanation: The clinical features of fever, joint pain in small joints, and rash point to chikungunya and it is best confirmed by RT-PCR. Chikungunya virus Vector Clinical Manifestation Diagnosis Chikungunya virus belongs to A the Togaviridae family. Transmitted by Aedes aegypti, which are day-biting insects often found in human dwellings. Incubation Period : Around 5 (3–7) days. High fever and severe joint pain (arthralgia) causing a stooped posture. Other symptoms: headache, muscle pain, skin rashes, and tenosynovitis. Joint pain is intense, affecting small joints like wrists and ankles and it can persist for months. Viral Isolation : Viruses can be isolated from mosquito cell lines, but are only done in specialized labs. Serum Antibodies : IgM antibodies : Appear around 4 days after infection, lasting up to 3 months. (Option B ruled out) IgG antibodies : Detected after 2 weeks and persist for years, significant when there is a fourfold rise. (Option A ruled out) Molecular Diagnosis: RT-PCR is effective for detecting viral RNA. (Option C) Classical pigmentation on and around the nose in Chikungunya (Chik sign) Togaviridae Family : Alphavirus: Includes arboviruses transmitted by mosquitoes, such as chikungunya, O'nyong-nyong, Mayaro, Sindbis, Ross River, and various equine encephalitis viruses. Rubivirus: Contains the rubella virus, known for causing congenital rubella syndrome. Pestivirus: Primarily infects animals (e.g., mucosal disease virus, hog cholera virus) and does not typically affect humans. Positive blood culture for chikungunya virus (Option D): Chikungunya virus is not usually grown or detected in routine blood cultures, as this technique is designed to identify bacteria, not viruses.
