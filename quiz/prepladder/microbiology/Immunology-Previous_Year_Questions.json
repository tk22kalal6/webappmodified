      },
      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer C - C3: Explanation: The alternative pathway of complement activation is primarily initiated by the spontaneous hydrolysis of C3 to form C3(H2O) , which then binds to factor B. This activates the pathway and leads to the formation of the C3 convertase , which plays a key role in the amplification of the complement cascade. In the alternative pathway , C3 is crucial for both the activation and amplification of the complement system, as it is cleaved to form C3a and C3b , which further participate in opsonization, inflammation, and cell lysis. Complement System: Definition : A complex network of at least 30 proteins in the blood, crucial for innate and acquired immunity. Functions : Lysis : Directly kills pathogens by forming membrane pores. Opsonization : Coats pathogens to enhance recognition and uptake by phagocytes. Immune Clearance : Removes immune complexes from circulation. Inflammation : Triggers release of mediators, recruiting immune cells. Pathways of Complement Activation: Pathway Trigger Mechanism Key Components Involved Classical Pathway Binding of C1q to antigen-antibody complexes C1q (Option A ruled out) , C3 convertase, Membrane Attack Complex (MAC) Alternative Pathway Direct binding of complement proteins to pathogens C3, factors B and D, C3 convertase Lectin Pathway Binding of mannose-binding lectin (MBL) to mannose MBL, MASP1, MASP2, C4 (Option D ruled out) , C2 (Option B ruled out) , C3 convertase Key Points: Convergence : All pathways converge at the formation of the C3 convertase. C3 Convertase : Cleaves C3 into C3a and C3b, leading to the formation of C5 convertase and, ultimately, MAC. Regulation : The complement system is tightly regulated to prevent excessive activation and damage to host tissues. Regulatory Proteins : Include inhibitors and inactivators that control the cascade.",

      "question": "Which of the following is the most potent stimulator of naïve T-cells ?",
      "options": {
        "A": "Mature dendritic cells",
        "B": "Follicular dendritic cells",
        "C": "B lymphocytes",
        "D": "NK cells"
      },
      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "cells are antigen-presenting cells (APCs) that play a critical role in initiating and regulating immune responses. They are found in various tissues and are particularly abundant in lymphoid organs. When dendritic cells encounter antigens, such as microbial pathogens or tumor cells, they capture and process these antigens. Subsequently, they migrate to lymphoid organs, such as lymph nodes, where they present the processed antigens to naïve T-cells. Mature dendritic cells express high levels of co-stimulatory molecules, such as CD80 and CD86, as well as major histocompatibility complex (MHC) molecules. These molecules are necessary for effective T-cell activation. When a naïve T-cell recognizes its specific antigen presented by a mature dendritic cell, a complex series of signaling events occur, leading to T-cell activation and proliferation. The interaction between naïve T-cells and mature dendritic cells is crucial for initiating adaptive immune responses. It leads to the differentiation of naïve T-cells into effector T-cells, such as cytotoxic T-cells or helper T-cells, which carry out specific immune functions to eliminate the pathogen or mediate immune responses. Incorrect Option: Option B . Follicular dendritic cells: Follicular dendritic cells (FDCs) are specialized stromal cells found in lymphoid follicles, particularly in the germinal centers of lymph nodes. They play a crucial role in the organization of B-cell areas and the generation of antibody responses. While FDCs interact with B-cells, they are not the primary stimulators of naïve T-cells. Option C . B lymphocytes: B lymphocytes, also known as B cells, are a type of white blood cell involved in humoral immune responses mediated by antibodies. B cells can present antigens to helper T-cells and receive signals from them for proper activation and differentiation. However, mature dendritic cells are generally considered more potent in stimulating naïve T-cells compared to B cells. Option D . NK cells: Natural killer (NK) cells are a type of cytotoxic lymphocyte that plays a role in innate immune responses, particularly in the early defense against viral infections and tumor surveillance. NK cells are not primarily involved in the stimulation of naïve T-cells, as their main function is to directly recognize and kill infected or abnormal cells. Reference: .",

        "C": "Type II",
        "D": "Type I"
      },
      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "hypersensitivity reaction . Type II hypersensitivity reactions are mediated by the binding of antibodies, typically IgM or IgG, to antigens on the surface of target cells or tissues. In the case of hyperacute rejection, p reformed antibodies in the recipient's blood react with antigens on the transplanted kidney , leading to immediate and severe destruction of the graft. Incorrect Options: Option A - Type IV hypersensitivity reaction: Type IV hypersensitivity reactions, also known as delayed-type hypersensitivity reactions, are cell-mediated immune responses involving T cells. They are characterized by a delayed onset of symptoms, typically 24-48 hours after exposure to the antigen. Type IV hypersensitivity reactions are not involved in hyperacute rejection, which occurs rapidly after transplantation. Option B - Type III hypersensitivity reaction: Type III hypersensitivity reactions involve the formation of immune complexes composed of antigens and antibodies, leading to tissue damage when deposited in various organs. These reactions typically occur several hours to days after exposure to the antigen. Hyperacute rejection of renal transplants is not primarily mediated by immune complex deposition, making type III hypersensitivity reaction an incorrect option. Option D - Type I hypersensitivity reaction: Type I hypersensitivity reactions, also known as immediate hypersensitivity or allergic reactions, involve the release of histamine and other inflammatory mediators in response to an allergen. Type I hypersensitivity reactions are associated with conditions such as allergies, asthma, and anaphylaxis. They are not directly implicated in hyperacute rejection of renal transplants.

MHC I is not primarily involved in antibody-mediated autoimmune diseases like myasthenia gravis, which involve MHC Class II. MHC Class I molecules are found only on professional antigen-presenting cells, which present the antigen to helper T-cells (Option C): MHC Class I molecules are found on all nucleated cells, not just APCs. Additionally, MHC I interacts with CD8+ T-cells rather than helper T-cells (CD4+). The statement here mischaracterizes both the distribution and the function of MHC Class I molecules. MHC Class II molecules are present on all nucleated cells and help in presenting intracellular antigens (Option D): MHC Class II is restricted to antigen-presenting cells, not all nucleated cells, and presents extracellular antigens, not intracellular ones. In autoimmune reactions, extracellular antigens are generally presented by MHC II to CD4+ T-cells, which is key to the autoantibody production pathway in myasthenia gravis.

      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: A) Cell-mediated response Explanation: Type IV hypersensitivity, also known as delayed-type hypersensitivity (DTH) , is primarily mediated by T cells, not antibodies. It involves the activation of T lymphocytes that release cytokines, leading to inflammation and tissue damage. The response is delayed, typically occurring 48-72 hours after exposure to the antigen. Types of hypersensitivity reactions and their features: Type Mechanism Clinical Features Onset Type I Early IgE-mediated mast cell degranulation Hives, swelling, respiratory distress Immediate (minutes) Type I Delayed IgE-mediated mast cell degranulation Wheezing, chest tightness, localized itching Hours to days Type II Antibody-mediated cell destruction Hemolytic anemia, thrombocytopenia Delayed (hours to days) Type III Immune complex deposition Joint pain, fever, vasculitis Delayed (hours to days) Type IV T-cell mediated response Skin rash, contact dermatitis Delayed (48-72 hours) Cell-mediated and antibody-mediated response (Option B): This option describes a scenario that is more characteristic of Type III hypersensitivity, which involves both immune complexes (antibody-antigen complexes) and cell-mediated responses. Antibody-mediated response (Option C): Type II and Type III hypersensitivity are antibody-mediated responses. In Type II, antibodies (IgG or IgM) bind to cell surface antigens, causing complement activation or cell destruction. In Type III, antibodies form immune complexes that deposit in tissues, leading to inflammation. Innate response (Option D): The innate immune response involves components like macrophages, neutrophils, and dendritic cells, but Type IV hypersensitivity is specifically a T-cell mediated adaptive immune response.

        "C": "mRNA splicing",
        "D": "VDJ rearrangement"
      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: B) Somatic hypermutation Explanation: Affinity maturation is a process where B cells undergo somatic hypermutation in germinal centers, leading to the production of antibodies with higher affinity for the antigen. This occurs after the initial IgM response, resulting in the production of IgG (or other classes) with enhanced specificity and effectiveness. Antibody formation involves B cell activation upon encountering an antigen. The initial response produces IgM , which can then undergo class switching to produce other antibody types like IgG, IgA, and IgE. This process is crucial for mounting an effective immune response against pathogens, with IgG being the most abundant antibody in serum and providing long-term immunity. The formation of antibodies, or immunoglobulins involves multiple cellular components and steps: Antigen Encounter and Recognition The process begins when B cells encounter a specific antigen. This antigen must be recognized as foreign to activate the adaptive immune response. B cell receptors (BCRs) on the surface of B cells bind to the antigen. This recognition is highly specific and depends on the unique variable regions of the immunoglobulin on BCRs. Activation of B Cells Upon binding with the antigen, B cells become activated, which requires help from T helper (Th) cells. T cells are required to release cytokines and co-stimulatory signals, which aid in the full activation of B cells, especially in the case of protein antigens. Proliferation and Clonal Expansion Activated B cells undergo clonal expansion, where they proliferate to create identical cells that can produce the same specific antibody. This clonal expansion amplifies the immune response, ensuring that a sufficient number of cells are available to target the pathogen. Differentiation into Plasma Cells and Memory B Cells Following expansion, B cells differentiate into two main cell types: Plasma Cells : These are the effector cells that actively secrete antibodies. Plasma cells are responsible for producing large quantities of antibodies, which are then released into the bloodstream. Memory B Cells : These cells are long-lived and retain the memory of the specific antigen. Upon subsequent exposure to the same antigen, memory B cells can quickly initiate a secondary immune response, leading to a faster and more robust production of antibodies. Antibody Class Switching Initially, B cells produce IgM antibodies. However, with the help of Th cells, B cells can undergo a process called \"class switching\" to produce other types of antibodies like IgG, IgA, or IgE. Class switching allows the immune system to adapt the type of antibody produced to the specific requirements of the immune response, depending on the nature of the pathogen and the location of the infection. Affinity Maturation Affinity maturation occurs in the germinal centers of lymphoid tissues and involves the somatic hypermutation of antibody genes. This process leads to the production of antibodies with increased affinity for the antigen, allowing for a more effective immune response. Memory and Long-Term Immunity Memory B cells generated during the primary response ensure long-term immunity. If the same antigen is encountered again, these cells quickly respond by differentiating into plasma cells and producing antibodies. This secondary immune response is usually faster and more intense due to the Spresence of these memory cells. Incorrect Options: Isotype switching (Option A): Isotype (class) switching alters the constant region of the antibody (e.g., IgM → IgG, IgA, or IgE) without affecting antigen specificity. It allows adaptation of antibody function but does not directly enhance antigen affinity. mRNA splicing (Option C): This",

      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: C) Complement deficiency Explanation: Complement deficiencies primarily impair the humoral immune response. However, patients have normal T-cell function, making both live and inactivated vaccines safe. Vaccination against meningococcal and pneumococcal infections are strongly recommended. DiGeorge syndrome (Option A): DiGeorge syndrome is characterized by thymic hypoplasia, leading to T-cell deficiency. Live vaccines are contraindicated in patients with severe T-cell deficiency due to the risk of vaccine-induced infection. However, in mild cases with adequate T-cell function, some live vaccines may be considered under specialist guidance. Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome (Option B): Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome (WAS) is a combined B and T cell immunodeficiency, increasing susceptibility to infections. Live vaccines are generally avoided due to impaired immune responses and the risk of vaccine-strain infection. Patients with WAS may receive inactivated vaccines. Ataxia-telangiectasia (Option D): Ataxia-telangiectasia is a DNA repair disorder associated with immunodeficiency, particularly affecting IgA and T-cell function. Live vaccines are generally avoided due to impaired cellular immunity, which increases the risk of adverse effects from attenuated pathogens.

      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: B) Absent B cells Explanation: CD40 Characteristics: A TNF receptor family member expressed on B cells, APCs, non-immune cells, and tumors, which is an essential costimulatory marker. Binds CD40L, which is transiently expressed on T cells and inflamed non-immune cells. It interacts with CD40L on T helper cells, which is crucial for B cell activation, proliferation, and class switching. If CD40 is absent, B cells cannot receive activation signals, leading to defective antibody production and absent/malfunctional B cells. This condition is associated with Hyper-IgM Syndrome , an immunodeficiency disorder where B cells fail to undergo class switching due to defective CD40 signaling. Absent T cells (Option A): T cells are present but fail to provide effective help to B cells due to impaired CD40-CD40L interaction. NK cells do not rely on CD40 for their development. Absent Macrophages (Option D): Macrophages are present but show impaired activation, leading to decreased IL-12 production and defective T-cell-mediated immunity.

This process typically includes the following steps: Immunization: An animal, such as a mouse, is immunized with the target antigen to stimulate the production of specific antibodies by B cells. Harvesting antibody-producing cells: Antibody-producing cells, specifically the B cells, are isolated from the immunized animal, typically from the spleen or lymph nodes. Fusion: The isolated B cells are fused with myeloma cells, which are immortal tumor cells. This fusion creates hybridoma cells that possess the ability to produce antibodies indefinitely. Screening and selection: The hybridoma cells are screened and selected based on their ability to produce the desired antibody. This involves testing the specificity and affinity of the antibodies produced by different hybridoma clones. Cloning: Selected hybridoma cells are cloned to obtain pure and stable cell lines, ensuring the consistent production of the desired monoclonal antibody. Antibody production: The established",

      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "reaction/IgE-mediated hypersensitivity reaction. In response to the allergic food, the immune system produces large amounts of IgE antibodies that bind to mast cells and basophils. This triggers the release of histamine and other inflammatory mediators that cause the symptoms of anaphylaxis. This reaction occurs in 2 phases: Sensitization Phase Effector Phase Sensitization Phase: Allergen is processed by APC & peptides of it are presented to CD4 T-cells → activates TH cells → IL4 is released → activates B cells → IgE production → homocytotropism (movement towards the mast cells) and sensitize the mast cells. Effector Phase: Same allergen presented second time → Mast cell degranulation → Primary and secondary mediators. Incorrect Options: Option A - T Cell-Mediated Cytotoxicity: It is a type 4 hypersensitivity reaction, for example, Mantoux test and multiple sclerosis. Option C - IgG-Mediated Reaction: IgG-mediated reactions are seen in type 2 hypersensitivity reactions, for example, Rh incompatibility and blood transfusion reactions. Option D - Antigen-Antibody Complex Mediated: It is a type 3 hypersensitivity reaction, for example, Systemic lupus erythematosus and Henoch schonlein purpura. Reference: Prepladder Notes",
