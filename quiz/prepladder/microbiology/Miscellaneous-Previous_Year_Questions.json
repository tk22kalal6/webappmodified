      "question": "Which culture medium is used to distinguish lactose fermenters from non-lactose fermenters?",
      "options": {
        "A": "Bile salt agar",
        "B": "Thayer-Martin agar",
        "C": "Sabouraud Dextrose Agar",
        "D": "MacConkey agar"
      },
      "correct_answer": "D",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: D) MacConkey agar Explanation: MacConkey agar is a selective and differential medium used to isolate and distinguish Gram-negative enteric bacteria based on lactose fermentation. This is a selective and differential medium that indicates lactose fermentation. Lactose fermenters (e.g., E. coli, Klebsiella, Enterobacter) → Pink colonies due to acid production. Non-lactose fermenters (e.g., Salmonella, Shigella, Proteus) → Colorless colonies due to lack of acid production. MacConkey Agar with Lactose fermenting and Non-Lactose fermenting colonies Bile salt agar (Option A): This medium is used for the isolation of enteric bacteria, particularly Salmonella and Shigella, but does not specifically differentiate lactose fermenters from non-fermenters. Thayer-Martin agar (Option B): This is a selective medium containing antibiotics (vancomycin, colistin, nystatin, trimethoprim) used for the isolation of Neisseria species (e.g., Neisseria gonorrhoeae and Neisseria meningitidis). Sabouraud Dextrose Agar (Option C): This medium is used for fungal cultures, particularly Candida, Aspergillus, and dermatophytes, and does not differentiate lactose fermentation.",

      "question": "Which among the following culture media is used in the identification of Salmonella?",
      "options": {
        "A": "PLET medium",
        "B": "BCYE medium",
        "C": "Wilson & Blair medium",
        "D": "Stuart's medium"
      },
      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: C) Wilson & Blair medium Explanation: Wilson & Blair medium is a selective agar used specifically for the isolation and identification of Salmonella species, particularly Salmonella typhi . This medium contains brilliant green , which inhibits the growth of most bacteria except for Salmonella, and helps in the selective growth of this organism while also aiding in its identification through distinctive colony characteristics. PLET medium (Option A) : This medium is used for the isolation of Listeria monocytogenes , not Salmonella. BCYE medium (Option B) : Buffered Charcoal Yeast Extract (BCYE) agar is used for the isolation of Legionella species, not Salmonella. Stuart's medium (Option D) : This is a transport medium used for the transport of specimens, particularly for maintaining the viability of pathogens, but it is not used for the isolation of Salmonella.

      "question": "Plasma sterilization is done by",
      "options": {
        "A": "Ethylene oxide",
        "B": "Gamma rays",
        "C": "Hydrogen peroxide",
        "D": "Ultraviolet radiation"
      },
      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: C) Hydrogen peroxide Explanation: Plasma sterilization is a method of sterilizing medical instruments and other equipment by using hydrogen peroxide in a low-pressure environment. The hydrogen peroxide is vaporized and then subjected to a plasma field , which generates highly reactive ions and free radicals that effectively kill microorganisms. Risk category Recommended method Medical device/Equipment 1. Critical device (high risk): Items that enter a normally sterile site . Sterilisation If heat resistant : Hot air oven or autoclave If heat-sensitive : Ionising radiation or ethylene oxide or plasma sterilisation. Surgical instruments , implants /prostheses, rigid endoscopes , syringes, needles, CuT, Urinary catheter 2. Semi-critical device (intermediate risk): Items in contact with mucous membranes or body fluids . High-level disinfection (HLD) : Such as glutaraldehyde , ortho-phthalaldehyde, formaldehyde and hydrogen peroxide . Respiratory equipment , non-invasive flexible endoscopes, bedpans , urine bottles 3. Non-critical (low-risk) Items in contact with intact skin. Intermediate or Low-level disinfection (ILD or LLD): Such as phenols , chlorhexidine, isopropyl alcohol , povidone-iodine , etc Patient items include blood pressure cuffs , ECG electrodes, thermometer and stethoscopes . Environmental surfaces include computers, bed rails , food utensils, bedside tables , patient furniture and floor. Ethylene oxide (Option A) : This is used for gas sterilization , but it is not associated with plasma sterilization. It is effective for sterilizing heat- and moisture-sensitive items. Gamma rays (Option B) : Gamma radiation is used in radiation sterilization , which is another method of sterilization, but it is not related to plasma sterilization. Ultraviolet radiation (Option D) : UV radiation is effective for surface sterilization but does not penetrate materials deeply enough for plasma sterilization.

      "question": "While collecting a blood sample for investigations, you accidentally dropped a 5 ml tube of blood and spilled blood. Which among the following is the best solution to clean it?",
      "options": {
        "A": "1:100 sodium hypochlorite",
        "B": "Isopropyl alcohol",
        "C": "Hydrogen peroxide",
        "D": "1:1000 sodium hypochlorite"
      },
      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: A) 1:100 sodium hypochlorite Explanation: Small blood spillage (<10 mL) should be managed by 1:100 dilution of 5.25% Sodium hypochlorite after cleaning the area with an absorbable material. Halogens: Examples Tincture Iodine (2% Iodine): bactericidal + sporicidal Povidone Iodine (Betadine): has residual action Sodium hypochlorite (5.25%): Both bactericidal + virucidal Mechanism of action Oxidisation Uses Skin antiseptic, wound dressing (Betadine preferred) Town water supply, Swimming pools (Chlorine) Sodium hypochlorite: Blood spills (1:10/1:100 dilution of 5.25% solution used) Blood spills management: Block off the area to be disinfected. Wear a pair of non-sterile gloves. Use brush and tongs to clean up broken glass pieces (never use bare hands) and discard the pieces onto a Sharps container (White). Use an absorbable material (paper/gauze/cloth) to wipe off body fluids/blood. Saturate the area with Sodium hypochlorite: Dose: 5.25% Sodium hypochlorite Strength: Small spills (<10 mL) - 1:100 , Large spills (>10 mL) - 1:10 dilution Rinse off the instruments used with running water and place to dry, discard absorbable material into the yellow bin. Remove and discard gloves into the red bin. Wash hands carefully with soap and water and dry using single-use towels. Record the incidence in the register. Isopropyl alcohol (Option B) : While it is a good disinfectant, it’s not as effective against all bloodborne pathogens compared to sodium hypochlorite, especially in the context of cleaning up blood spills. Hydrogen peroxide (Option C) : It can be used for cleaning but is not as effective as sodium hypochlorite for disinfecting blood spills. 1:1000 sodium hypochlorite (Option D) : This dilution is too weak to effectively disinfect blood spills. The 1:100 dilution is the standard recommendation.",

      "question": "An unknown disease of suspected infectious origin has come up in your town. As a microbiologist, you collect the relevant samples and detect the etiological cause. Which of the following types of PCR would you do?",
      "options": {
        "A": "Real time PCR",
        "B": "Nested PCR",
        "C": "Reverse transcriptase PCR",
        "D": "Multiplex"
      },
      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: A) Real time PCR Explanation: Real-time PCR (RT-PCR) , also known as quantitative PCR (qPCR) , is widely used for detecting and quantifying the presence of specific pathogens (whether bacterial, viral, or fungal). It provides real-time monitoring of the amplification process and is sensitive, specific, and fast, making it ideal for diagnosing infectious diseases, particularly in an outbreak situation. It also allows for quantification of the pathogen, which can help in assessing the severity of the infection and monitoring the response to treatment. Nested PCR (Option B) : Nested PCR is useful for amplifying DNA in cases where the target is present in very small amounts, but it requires two sets of primers and multiple amplification steps, which makes it more time-consuming. It is typically used when a specific pathogen is suspected, but real-time PCR is more versatile and quicker for detection and quantification. Reverse Transcriptase PCR (Option C) (RT-PCR) : This is specifically used for RNA viruses , where the RNA is first reverse-transcribed into cDNA before amplification. If you suspect an infectious disease caused by a virus with RNA as the genetic material (like influenza, HIV, or SARS-CoV-2), this could be useful. However, real-time PCR can also be used for RNA detection with added reverse transcription, making it a more comprehensive choice. Multiplex PCR (Option D) : Multiplex PCR allows the simultaneous detection of multiple pathogens in a single reaction, which is useful if you suspect the presence of multiple pathogens. While this is very useful for broad diagnostics, real-time PCR offers the added benefit of quantification and faster results for a more specific pathogen detection.

      "question": "Which of the following options is considered a high-level disinfectant?",
      "options": {
        "A": "Isopropyl alcohol",
        "B": "Glutaraldehyde",
        "C": "lodophores",
        "D": "Phenol"
      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer B - Glutaraldehyde Explanation: Glutaraldehyde is considered a high-level disinfectant , meaning it is capable of killing most microorganisms, including bacteria, viruses, and fungi, as well as spores (although it may require longer exposure times for spores). It is commonly used to disinfect medical equipment and instruments that cannot withstand the high temperatures required for autoclaving. Glutaraldehyde is effective at sterilizing items when used properly, although it can be toxic, so precautions are necessary during its use.
