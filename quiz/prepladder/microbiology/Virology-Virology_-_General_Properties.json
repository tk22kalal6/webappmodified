      "explanation": "Correct Answer: B) All animal viruses are spherical in shape Explanation: Animal viruses have different shapes, but most are spherical. General properties of viruses Characteristics They do not have a cellular organisation. Obligate intracellular parasites - cannot replicate outside a host. (Option C) Lack enzymes necessary for protein and nucleic acid synthesis. Multiply via a complex process. They cannot be cultured in cell-free culture media but can grow in embryonated eggs or tissue culture. They can pass through filters. Morphology All viruses have a protein coat that encases their genetic material. Either possess DNA or RNA but never both. (Option A) Nucleic acid is enclosed by a protein capsid, which may or may not be enclosed by a lipid envelope. (Option D) Shape Most are spherical.

      "explanation": "Correct Answer: C) Viral envelope is composed of lipids derived from the host cell membrane. virus is released by budding. STRUCTURE OF VIRUS CAPSID : Protein coat surrounding the viral nucleic acid. It is composed of small morphological units called capsomeres The polypeptide molecules are arranged symmetrically It forms an impenetrable shell around the nucleic core It is adsorbed by the host cell membrane readily, thus introducing the viral genome into the host ENVELOPED: Viral capsid is surrounded by a lipid membrane It is derived from the host cell membrane by viral progeny during the budding process (Option C) They have protein subunits that project on the envelope surface ( Peplomers ), which are viral-coded The shape of the virus depends on the lipid envelope. (Option D) Example (Option A) Influenza virus has two types of peplomers: Hemagglutinin : Triangular spike. Neuraminidase : Mushroom-shaped structure. Functions: Confers chemical , antigenic , and biological properties . Facilitates attachment to host cell surfaces. Aids in processes such as hemagglutination Enveloped viruses are sensitive to lipid solvents, including Ether, Chloroform and Bile salts. Specific neutralisation of virus infectivity is mediated by antibodies targeting surface antigens. Some viruses may have unique structural features, e.g., fibrils protruding from the vertices of adenovirus particles. NON-ENVELOPED: Lack the lipid membrane, and viral capsid is naked They lack the lipid membrane More resistant to lipid solvents (Option B) The shape of the virus depends on the shape of the capsid (Option D) Most viruses are enveloped except: Naked DNA viruses: Parvovirus, Papavovirus and Adenovirus Naked RNA viruses: Picornaviruses, reovirus, calicivirus, astroviridae, Hep A and Hep E Reference: Ananthanarayan and Paniker’s Textbook of Microbiology, 10th Edition, Page 435.

      "question": "A patient’s cell culture exhibits distinct cytopathic effects characterised by the formation of syncytia (multinucleated giant cells). Based on these observations, which virus is most likely responsible for the infection?",
      "options": {
        "A": "Adenovirus",
        "B": "Enterovirus",
        "C": "Measles virus",
        "D": "Simian virus 40"
      },
      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: C) Measles virus Explanation: Syncytia formation is a characteristic cytopathic effect associated with measles virus infection, distinguishing it from other viruses. This occurs due to the fusion of infected cells, resulting in multinucleated giant cells. While the Herpes simplex virus can also cause syncytia, measles is more characteristically associated with this effect in cell cultures. Adenovirus and enterovirus typically do not exhibit syncytia formation. Detection of Virus Growth in Cell Cultures: Cytopathic Effect (CPE) refers to the morphological changes induced by a virus in a cell line, which can be observed using a light microscope. While not all viruses cause CPE, those are known as cytopathic viruses. Each virus has a unique type of CPE that helps to identify: Enteroviruses (Option B) : Rapid CPE with cell crenation and degeneration. Measles virus: Syncytium formation (RSV or respiratory syncytial virus). Herpesvirus: Discrete focal degeneration, ballooning and syncitium formation. Adenovirus (Option A) : Large granular clumps resembling bunches of grapes. SV40 or Simian virus 40 (Option D) : Prominent cytoplasmic vacuolation. Metabolic Inhibition: Cellular metabolism produces acid in normal cultures, causing a colour change in the medium's pH indicator (phenol red). When viruses grow, metabolism gets inhibited , leading to reduced acid production and a colour change . Hemadsorption : Hemagglutinating viruses, such as influenza , can be detected by adding guinea pig erythrocytes to the culture. If the viruses replicate, the erythrocytes will adsorb onto the cell surfaces. Interference: The presence of a non-cytopathogenic virus inhibits the growth of a subsequent challenge with a known cytopathogenic virus. Transformation: Oncogenic viruses can induce cell transformation, leading to loss of contact inhibition and the formation of microtumors in culture. Other Methods for Detecting Viral Growth: Direct Immunofluorescence Assay detects viral antigens on the surface of cells. Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) is used to detect viral genes. Electron Microscopy allows visualisation of viruses within infected cell lines. Shell Vial Technique: For viruses like CMV , which require several weeks to exhibit CPE, the shell vial technique offers a quicker detection method (1-2 days).

      "question": "A new respiratory virus has emerged in a rural community, with early reports indicating a high transmission rate and increased hospitalisations. Public health officials must evaluate the virus's infectivity to implement effective control measures. Which of the following assays is most appropriate for quantifying the virus's infectivity?",
      "options": {
        "A": "Endpoint Assay",
        "B": "Electron microscopy",
        "C": "Plaque Assay",
        "D": "Haemagglutination"
      },
      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: C) Plaque Assay Explanation: The Plaque assay is the most suitable method for quantifying viral infectivity, as it allows for the determination of the number of infectious viral particles based on the formation of plaques in a cell culture. Each plaque represents an area of localised infection caused by a single infectious unit of the virus, providing a direct count of viral infectivity. The endpoint assay (Option A) measures the highest dilution, which still produces a specific effect but does not provide a direct count. Electron microscopy (Option B) is used to visualise viral particles. Haemagglutination (Option D) detects viral activity but does not quantify it. Viral assays: Viral enumeration Electron microscopy: The ratio of a virus suspension mixed with latex particles, as observed under an electron microscope (negative staining), indicates the virus count. Hemagglutination: RBCs are added to a serial dilution of a virus sample (with H spikes) to determine the hemagglutination titer; the highest dilution showing RBC agglutination indicates the number of virions. Viral infective assays Assay Description Endpoint assay They are used for infectivity titration, for example, animal mortality, hemagglutinin production in allantoic fluid, and the appearance of cytopathic effects (CPE) in cell cultures. Plaque assay Agar is poured over a viral specimen on a cell line, revealing visible plaques (localised focus) of infected cells. The number of plaques corresponds to the infective virions. Pox assay Assessed by counting the number of pocks formed on the chorioallantoic membrane (CAM) from the appropriate viral inocula (Eg, Vaccinia)",
