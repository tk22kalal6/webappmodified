        "C": "Moraxella catarrhalis",
        "D": "Escherichia coli"
      },
      "correct_answer": "D",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: D) Escherichia coli Explanation: Escherichia coli (Enterobacteriaceae family) is a Gram-negative rod that is oxidase-negative. The oxidase test is used to identify bacteria that produce cytochrome c oxidase, an enzyme involved in the electron transport chain. E. coli does not produce this enzyme and, therefore, does not turn the oxidase reagent purple, indicating a negative result. Oxidase-positive organisms- Organism Morphology Associated Diseases Neisseria Gram-negative diplococci Gonorrhea, Meningitis Pseudomonas Gram-negative rods Opportunistic infections, Pneumonia, UTI Vibrio Gram-negative comma-shaped rods Cholera, Gastroenteritis Moraxella (Option C ruled out) Gram-negative diplococci Respiratory infections (e.g., otitis media, sinusitis) Campylobacter Gram-negative curved rods Gastroenteritis (Campylobacter jejuni) Aeromonas (Option A ruled out) Gram-negative rods Wound infections, Gastroenteritis Helicobacter (Option B ruled out) Gram-negative spiral rods Peptic ulcers, Gastritis (H. pylori) Legionella Gram-negative rods Legionnaires' disease Brucella Gram-negative coccobacilli Brucellosis Haemophilus Gram-negative coccobacilli Pneumonia, Otitis media, Epiglottitis, Meningitis, Sinusitis (H.

      "question": "A 3-year-old unvaccinated child presents with high fever, irritability, and neck stiffness. Gram stain of CSF reveals small gram-negative coccobacilli. Which of the following statements regarding the suspected pathogen and its management is correct?",
      "options": {
        "A": "Requires X and V factors; type b capsule most virulent in young children",
        "B": "PCR of bexA gene confirms diagnosis; culture on chocolate agar is unnecessary",

        "D": "Third-generation cephalosporins are contraindicated; use chloramphenicol"
      },
      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer A) Requires X and V factors; type b capsule most virulent in young children. capsular polysaccharide (polyribosylribitol phosphate or PRP) is the most virulent serotype, particularly in unvaccinated children under 5 years old, often causing invasive diseases like meningitis. Clinical features: Meningitis: Fever, irritability, neck stiffness (as described in the question) Other invasive diseases: Epiglottitis, pneumonia, septic arthritis Nontypeable strains often cause mucosal infections like otitis media, sinusitis Diagnosis: CSF analysis in meningitis: elevated protein, low glucose, pleocytosis Gram stain: small gram-negative coccobacilli Culture on chocolate agar Antigen detection tests (latex agglutination) for rapid diagnosis PCR for definitive identification and serotyping Treatment: Empiric therapy: Third-generation cephalosporins (ceftriaxone or cefotaxime) Alternative: Chloramphenicol (if cephalosporin allergy) Duration: Usually 10 days for meningitis PCR of bexA gene confirms diagnosis; culture on chocolate agar is unnecessary (Option B): While PCR for the bexA gene can detect H. influenzae type b, culture remains crucial for antibiotic susceptibility testing. Moreover, chocolate agar (which provides X and V factors) is the preferred medium for culturing H. influenzae. Non-typeable strains' lipooligosaccharide is more potent than type b capsule (Option C): The capsule of type b strains is actually more potent in inducing meningeal inflammation than the lipooligosaccharide of non-typeable strains. The capsule is a major virulence factor in invasive disease. Third-generation cephalosporins are contraindicated; use chloramphenicol (Option D): Third-generation cephalosporins (like ceftriaxone) are actually the first-line treatment for H. influenzae meningitis, even in β -lactamase-producing strains. Chloramphenicol is no longer considered first-line due to resistance concerns and potential toxicity.

      "question": "Gram stain of a painful genital ulcer exudate shows gram-negative coccobacilli in a \"school of fish\" arrangement. Which statement about the suspected pathogen is correct?",
      "options": {
        "A": "Requires X factor but not V factor; grows on vancomycin-supplemented chocolate agar",
        "B": "\"Pushing test\" is diagnostic; further laboratory confirmation unnecessary",

        "D": "Single-dose azithromycin; partner treatment optional if asymptomatic"
      },
      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "chocolate agar Correct Answer: A) Requires X factor but not V factor; grows on vancomycin-supplemented chocolate agar Explanation: H. ducreyi requires X factor (hemin) but not V factor. Chocolate agar supplemented with vancomycin is the optimal culture medium, providing necessary nutrients and inhibiting normal flora. Features of H. ducreyi: Gram-negative coccobacillus Fastidious, requiring X factor but not V factor Forms characteristic \"school of fish\" or \"railroad track\" arrangements in Gram stains Safety pin appearance of bipolar staining.

Laboratory confirmation is still necessary. The push test is a method used to identify Haemophilus ducreyi colonies on an agar surface by gently pushing them with a toothpick: H. ducreyi colonies are cohesive and remain intact when pushed across the agar surface. The colonies are typically translucent to semi-opaque, yellow-gray in color, and pinpoint in size. Multiplex PCR is less sensitive than culture for diagnosis (Option C): Multiplex PCR is more sensitive than culture for H. ducreyi diagnosis, not less. Single-dose azithromycin; partner treatment optional if asymptomatic (Option D): While single-dose azithromycin is a recommended treatment, partner treatment is necessary regardless of symptoms.

      },
      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: C) Moraxella catarrhalis Explanation: Moraxella catarrhalis is not typically considered an oral commensal. It is primarily found in the upper respiratory tract, particularly the nasopharynx, but is not a typical member of the oral microbiota. It is not part of the HACEK group. Understanding the normal microbiota of different body sites is crucial for interpreting culture results and identifying potential pathogens. While HACEK organisms are oral commensals, they can cause opportunistic infections, particularly endocarditis. The HACEK group consists of: Haemophilus species (particularly H. parainfluenzae) Aggregatibacter species (including A. actinomycetemcomitans) (Option A ruled out) Cardiobacterium hominis (Option B ruled out) Eikenella corrodens (Option D ruled out) Kingella kingae Body Site Predominant Commensal Organisms Skin Staphylococcus epidermidis , Propionibacterium acnes Nose Staphylococcus aureus , Staphylococcus epidermidis Oropharynx Viridans streptococci , Neisseria species Dental Plaque Streptococcus mutans , Streptococcus sanguinis Colon Bacteroides fragilis , Escherichia coli Vagina Lactobacillus species , Gardnerella vaginalis , Group B Streptococcus Urethra Staphylococcus epidermidis , Corynebacterium species Reference: Ananthanarayan & Paniker's Textbook of Microbiology, 10th Edition, Pages 339, 340 Bailey & Scott's Diagnostic Microbiology, 14th Edition, Pages 435, 436",

      "question": "A 6-month-old unvaccinated infant presents with paroxysmal cough followed by whooping inspiration and post-tussive vomiting for the past 2 weeks. Which of the following is the most sensitive and specific method for confirming the diagnosis in this case?",
      "options": {
        "A": "Gram staining of nasopharyngeal swab",
        "B": "Culture on Bordet-Gengou medium",
        "C": "Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) of nasopharyngeal aspirate",
        "D": "Serological testing for anti-pertussis toxin IgG"
      },
      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: C) Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) of nasopharyngeal aspirate Explanation: PCR of nasopharyngeal aspirate is currently the most sensitive and specific method for diagnosing pertussis, especially in the later stages of the disease. It can detect even small numbers of organisms and provides rapid results. Bordetella features: Small, aerobic, gram-negative coccobacilli B. pertussis is the main cause of whooping cough Other species include B. parapertussis, B. bronchiseptica Virulence factors: Pertussis toxin (increase insulin release; hypoglycemia) Filamentous hemagglutinin (binds bacteria to epithelial cells) Pertactin Adenylate cyclase toxin (increases intracellular cAMP) Clinical features of pertussis: 1. Catarrhal stage: Mild upper respiratory symptoms 2. Paroxysmal stage: Characteristic paroxysmal cough with inspiratory whoop and post-tussive vomiting 3. Convalescent stage: Gradual recovery Treatment: Macrolides (azithromycin, clarithromycin) are the first-line antibiotics Early treatment (within 1-2 weeks of symptom onset) can reduce severity and duration Supportive care is crucial, especially for infants Prevention: DTaP vaccine for infants and children Tdap booster for adolescents and adults Gram staining of nasopharyngeal swab (Option A): Gram staining is not reliable for diagnosing pertussis. B. pertussis is a small gram-negative coccobacillus that is difficult to visualize and differentiate from other respiratory flora. Culture on Bordet-Gengou medium (Option B): While culture on Bordet-Gengou medium is specific, it has low sensitivity, especially after the first 2 weeks of illness or if antibiotics have been started. It also takes 7-10 days for results. Serological testing for anti-pertussis toxin IgG (Option D): Serological testing for anti-pertussis toxin IgG can be useful for late diagnosis or epidemiological studies, but it's not ideal for acute diagnosis, especially in infants who may not have mounted a significant antibody response yet.

      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: C) Ferments carbohydrates Explanation: Brucella does not typically ferment carbohydrates. Therefore, it is the characteristic least likely associated with Brucellae. Brucella features: Brucella melitensis is the most pathogenic species for humans. Characteristics of Brucella: Morphology Biochemical Properties Growth & Susceptibility Small, non-motile, aerobic, Gram-negative coccobacilli (Option A ruled out) Catalase positive Do not grow well on standard laboratory media Non-capsulated and non-spore forming Oxidase positive (except B. neotomae and B. ovis) Destroyed by heat at 60°C in 10 minutes (Option D ruled out) Often exhibit a bipolar staining appearance Urease positive (Option B ruled out) Killed by 1% phenol in 15 minutes Utilize oxygen but do not typically ferment carbohydrates Killed by pasteurization Zoonotic Nature: Primarily affects goats, sheep, cattle, buffaloes, and pigs. Humans can become infected through contact with infected animals or consumption of contaminated animal products Clinical Presentation in Humans: Symptoms: Intermittent fever, loss of appetite, nausea, muscular and articular pains, fatigue, sweating, and joint pain Also known as Undulant fever, Mediterranean fever, Maltese fever Diagnosis is challenging due to nonspecific symptoms and relies on high clinical suspicion Diagnosis of Brucellosis: Laboratory Testing Methods: Blood Culture : Most definitive diagnostic method Requires trypticase soy broth or brucella broth in biphasic blood culture bottles (e.g., Castaneda method) Large blood volume (5 ml) recommended due to low bacterial load Incubation at 37°C under 5-10% CO2 for at least 6-8 weeks Positive in approximately 30-50% of cases Bone marrow cultures may have a higher yield Serological Tests : Used when culture methods are unsuccessful Serological Test Types: Test Description Key Points Standard Agglutination Test (SAT) Tube agglutination test using serial dilutions of patient's serum and killed B. abortus antigen Significant titer: 160 or more. Acute brucellosis titer: 640 or more within 3-4 weeks. Prozone phenomenon common. False positives with cholera, tularemia, yersinia infection, or immunization Complement Fixation Test Detects IgG antibodies Valuable in chronic cases ELISA (Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay) Distinguishes between IgM and IgG antibodies Useful for differentiating acute from chronic infections Rapid Tests Includes rapid dipstick tests and Rose Bengal card test Quick results. Can be used for initial screening Treatment of Brucellosis: Antibiotics: Standard treatment for adults: Doxycycline for 45 days and intramuscular streptomycin daily for the first two weeks Children: Cotrimoxazole with rifampicin or gentamycin Reference: Ananthanarayan and Paniker's Textbook of Microbiology, 10th Edition, Pages 345, 346, 347, 348, 349, 350.",
