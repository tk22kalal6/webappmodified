      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: C) Stool microscopy for trophozoites Explanation The patient’s signs and symptoms, recent travel history, and exposure to potentially contaminated water raise suspicion of an intestinal infection, particularly of Entamoeba histolytica. Demonstration of trophozoite in freshly passed stool is considered the gold standard microscopic test to diagnose active infection. Trophozoites are absent in asymptomatic carriers. Diagnosis of E. histolytica: Sample collection: Stool is the specimen of choice. Minimum of 3 stool samples should be collected on alternate days (within 10 days) as amoebae are shed intermittently. Stool macroscopy: Foul smelling, copious in amount, dark red in colour mixed with blood and mucus and not adherent to the container Stool microscopy: Direct examination of stool by saline and iodine mount to demonstrate trophozoites and cysts. Demonstration of trophozoites is considered the gold standard microscopic test for active infection. If Trophozoites are seen - Active disease. If only Cyst is seen - Carrier stage. Histology: Intestinal biopsies stained with PAS or H&E stains reveal trophozoites Stool culture Stool Antigen Detection: Fresh/frozen samples are used. ELISA Immunochromatographic test (ICT) Molecular Diagnosis: Nested multiplex PCR Real-time PCR BioFire FilmArray Colonoscopy: May show collar button or flask-shaped amoebic ulcers Miscellaneous finding on stool microscopy: Charcot Leyden crystal",

      },
      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: A) Gal/GalNAc lectin antigen Explanation: The Gal/GalNAc lectin antigen is a key virulence factor that facilitates adhesion by binding to glycoprotein receptors on the epithelial cells of the large intestine and the vascular endothelium. Trophozoite of E. histolytica is the invasive form and possesses many virulence factors such as: Gal/GalNAc lectin antigen - principal virulence factor Enzymes Metallo-collagenase Neuraminidase CP47 (Option B), or the Cryptosporidium protein, is the virulence factor of the intestinal coccidian parasites (Cryptosporidium, Cyclospora, and Cystoisospora). M protein (Option C) is the principal virulence factor of group A Streptococcus. It inhibits complement-mediated opsonisation by phagocytes. Hyaluronidase (Option D) is an enzyme produced by some bacteria such as Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus and Clostridia species, which breaks down hyaluronic acid in connective tissues. It aids in the spread of infections, but is not a virulence factor of E. histolytica. Reference: Essentials of Medical Microbiology, Apurba S Sastry, 3rd Edition, Page 428, 513, 522, 530",

      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: C) Naegleria fowleri Explanation: The clinical history described is most likely suggestive of primary amoebic meningoencephalitis (PAM), which is caused by Naegleria fowleri. Naegleria fowleri: Naegleria is a free-living amoeba commonly found in warm freshwater environments. In nature, it exists in two forms: cysts and trophozoites. Cyst: Round Trophozoite: Can occur in two forms – amoeboid and flagellated forms. Life cycle: Infective form: Trophozoite. Mode of transmission: Nasal contamination occurs during swimming in fresh, hot water bodies like ponds, rivers, swimming pools, or lakes. CNS invasion: Invades nasal mucosa → Cribriform plate → Olfactory nerve → Brain → Primary Amoebic Meningoencephalitis. Primary Amoebic Meningoencephalitis Causative organism: Naegleria fowleri Occurs in healthy children or young adults with a recent history of swimming in fresh, hot water. Initial symptoms include altered taste and smell (due to involvement of the olfactory nerve), followed by nausea, vomiting, high fever, and meningeal signs such as a stiff neck and positive Kernig’s sign. Secondary symptoms include confusion, hallucinations, lack of attention, ataxia, and seizures. Death occurs within 7–14 days after exposure. Diagnosis: CSF analysis: Thick, purulent CSF with pus cells, elevated protein and reduced sugar level (mimic bacterial meningitis). CSF microscopy: Detection of characteristic trophozoites in CSF (confirmatory). Culture: NNA (Non-Nutrient Agar) - lawn cultured with Escherichia coli. Treatment: Amphotericin B. Acanthamoeba species (Option A): Acanthamoeba is a free-living amoeba that can cause Granulomatous Amoebic Encephalitis (GAE), a rare and often chronic infection of the brain. GAE usually occurs in immunocompromised individuals . It also causes keratitis in contact lens users. Cryptococcus neoformans (Option C): It is a fungal pathogen that primarily affects immunocompromised individuals, such as those with HIV/AIDS. It causes chronic meningitis, typically presenting with headache, fever, and neurological changes. Infection is acquired by inhalation of aerosolized forms of Cryptococcus. Listeria monocytogenes (Option D): It is a bacterial cause of meningitis, often linked to foodborne transmission. It generally affects immunocompromised individuals, the elderly, neonates, or pregnant women (extremes of ages).",

      "explanation": "Correct Answer: D) It is seen in immunocompetent individuals. Explanation: The clinical presentation is indicative of granulomatous amoebic encephalitis (GAE). The microscopic examination of cerebrospinal fluid revealing trophozoites with spikes points to Acanthamoeba species as the causative organism. Infections caused by Acanthamoeba are typically observed in immunocompromised rather than immunocompetent individuals . Acanthamoeba: These species are free-living amoebae that infect CNS, skin and eye. Morphology: Cyst and trophozoite forms. There is no flagellated form. Infective form: Both cysts and trophozoites (Option B) . Mode of transmission: Entry through inhalation, ingestion, and cutaneous/ ocular contaminated lens solution. It causes (Option A) : GAE (granulomatous amoebic encephalitis) in immunocompromised patients. Keratitis among contact lens users. Granulomatous Amoebic Encephalitis (GAE) GAE has an insidious onset, and the incubation period varies from several weeks to months. Symptoms: Confusion, dizziness, nausea, headache, stiff neck and rarely seizure and hemiplegia. In HIV/immunocompromised patients: In addition to GAE, Acanthamoeba produces nasal ulcers, cutaneous ulcers and musculoskeletal abscesses. Pathology: Focal granulomatous lesions in the brain. CSF analysis: Lymphocytosis is seen. However, in patients with AIDS , no cells are seen in CSF. Diagnosis: Brain biopsy: shows trophozoites and cysts.

Imaging method: CT scan or MRI reveals space-occupying or ring-enhancing lesions in the brain. (Option C) Treatment: Pentamidine + Azole + Sulfonamide + Flucytosine. Vs Balamuthia mandrillaris Infection: Also causes Granulomatous Amoebic Encephalitis (GAE). Life cycle is similar to Acanthamoeba, and has trophozoites and cysts. Unlike Acanthamoeba, Balamuthia encephalitis has been found in immunocompetent individuals (Option D) . Differences from Acanthamoeba Trophozoite is fish-shaped. The cyst is smoother. It can occur in both immunocompetent and immunocompromised.",
