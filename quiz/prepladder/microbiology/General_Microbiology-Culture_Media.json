It is used for motility testing using Mannitol motility medium and Triple sugar iron agar test. CULTURE TECHNOLOGIES Culture Type Uses Picture Streak Culture (Option A) Primary inoculum smeared onto solid media. Secondary and tertiary inoculum formed by streaking parallel lines. Intermittent heating to obtain isolated colonies. Stroke Culture Zigzag streaking on agar slopes or slants. Used for biochemical tests like urease test. Lawn Culture (Option C) Uniform bacterial growth is obtained by swabbing or flooding. Used for antimicrobial susceptibility testing (AST) by disk diffusion method. Stab Culture (Option D) Agar butt stabbed with straight wire. Used for motility testing and triple sugar iron agar test. Liquid Culture (Option B) Used for blood or body fluids. Bacterial growth is detected by turbidity or surface pellicles. Advantages: Suitable for specimens with antibiotics, large yields. Disadvantages: It doesn't provide pure culture from mixed inoculum, and no visible colonies.",

      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "grow. Correct Answer: B ) Adding the sample onto the solidified agar surface and allowing colonies to grow. Explanation: In the pour plate method, the sample is added onto the solidified agar surface allowing colonies to grow. This allows for the colonies to grow both within the agar medium and on its surface, facilitating the enumeration of various types of bacteria including aerobes, anaerobes, and facultative anaerobes. Advantages : Provides quantitative data on viable bacterial count per ml of the original sample. Allows visualization and counting of individual colonies. Feature Pour Plate Technique Spread Plate Technique Process The sample is added onto the solidified agar surface. The sample is mixed with molten agar and poured. Accuracy Generally considered more accurate. Slightly less accurate compared to the pour plate. Sample Spreading The sample is not spread; colonies grow within agar. The sample is spread using a glass spreader. (Option C) Types of Bacteria Aerobes, anaerobes, facultative anaerobes. Aerobes only. Medium State Solidified agar plates are necessary. Molten agar medium is used (Option A) . Visibility of Colonies Colonies can grow both within and on the surface of agar. Colonies grow primarily on the surface. (Option D) Image",

Gram-negative broth – Used for Shigella isolation. Selenite F broth – Used for Shigella isolation. Alkaline peptone water (APW) – Used for Vibrio cholerae isolation. Lim Broth is an enrichment broth specifically used to enhance the growth of group B streptococci. It provides the necessary nutrients and conditions for the selective multiplication of these organisms. Selenite F medium (Option A): This enrichment medium is used primarily for stool samples to suppress gut bacteria growth while allowing diarrheagenic bacteria (Salmonella, Shigella) to grow. It is not specific to group B streptococci. Tetrathionate broth (Option B): This enrichment medium inhibits coliforms while allowing the growth of typhoid-paratyphoid bacilli. Alkaline peptone water (Option D): This enrichment medium is used to recover Vibrio and Aeromonas species from stool samples.

Explanation: Disc concentration is one of the Factors Influencing Zone Diameter KIRBY-BAUER METHOD Step Description Inoculation Use a standard dilution of a broth culture of the test bacterium. Inoculate the surface of a solid medium (Cation-adjusted Mueller-Hinton agar (CAMHA) as a lawn culture. Application of Antibiotic Discs Dry the plate at 37°C for 30 minutes. Apply 4-6 antibiotic discs per 9 cm plate with sterile forceps. (Option A ruled out) Incubation Incubate overnight. (Option C ruled out) Measure the zones of inhibition around the discs to determine sensitivity. Growth inhibition occurs around discs with effective antibiotics. Factors Influencing Zone Diameter Diffusibility of the drug Disc concentration Nature and composition of the medium (Option B ruled out) Medium thickness Presence of inhibitory or stimulatory substances pH Incubation time Potency Check Periodically check the potency of discs using standard ATCC strains: S. aureus ATCC 25923 E. coli ATCC 25922 P. aeruginosa ATCC 27853 Interpretation of Results Record zones of inhibition around the discs.

STOKES METHOD : Comparison of zones of inhibition: between standard & test bacteria. Indicates sensitivity/resistance of bacteria. Bacterial Sensitivity: Susceptible : Inhibited by drug concentration achieved in blood at the recommended dosage. (Option A ruled out) Intermediately Susceptible : Susceptible at higher dosages or effective at physiologically concentrated sites. Resistant : Not inhibited; specific resistance mechanisms present. (Option B ruled out) Choice of Antibiotic Disk: Tests clinically relevant antibiotics. Example: Chloramphenicol is unnecessary for urinary pathogens (mostly excreted inactive). Nitrofurantoin is relevant only for urinary pathogens.

      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "concentration of the antibiotic. Correct answer: C) It provides a visual and precise measurement of the minimum inhibitory concentration of the antibiotic. Explanation: The primary advantage of the E-test is that it provides a clear, visual indication of the MIC, which is the lowest concentration of an antibiotic that inhibits the growth of the bacterium. This helps clinicians choose the most effective antibiotic and dosage for treatment. Image showing E-test Step Description Setup An absorbent strip with a gradient of antibiotic concentrations is placed on a culture plate inoculated with the bacterium. Process The strip releases the antibiotic, creating a gradient in the medium. An elliptical zone of inhibition forms around the strip after incubation. Determination The MIC is identified at the point where the edge of the ellipse intersects with the strip, representing the lowest concentration of the antibiotic that inhibits bacterial growth (MIC). (Option C) Advantages Allows for the simultaneous testing of multiple antibiotics on a single plate and provides a visual, precise measurement of the MIC, enhancing accuracy compared to traditional disk diffusion methods. It identifies the specific bacterium causing the infection (Option A): The E-test assesses bacterial susceptibility to antibiotics but does not identify the specific bacterium. Additional tests like culture characteristics, biochemical tests, or molecular methods are needed for bacterial identification. It determines the bacterium's resistance to all known antibiotics (Option B): The E-test measures the MIC for specific antibiotics tested, not for all known antibiotics . Multiple E-tests with different antibiotics can be performed to get a broader resistance profile, but each test is specific to one antibiotic. It allows for the immediate administration of antibiotics without further testing (Option D): While the E-test provides valuable information, it still requires incubation and interpretation time. Immediate administration of antibiotics is typically guided by clinical judgment and empirical therapy, not solely by the results of the E-test.",
