      "question": "A 33-year-old male comes with complaints of dry cough, fever and shortness of breath for 2 days along with a loss of taste and smell. He is a social worker who has been traveling a lot. What would be the investigation of choice for this patient to confirm the diagnosis of COVID-19?",

      "correct_answer": "D",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: D) Real-time RT-PCR Explanation: Real-time RT-PCR is the gold standard for confirming COVID-19, as it detects viral RNA in respiratory samples with high sensitivity and specificity, allowing early detection even in asymptomatic cases. Real-Time RT-PCR for COVID-19 Diagnosis Real-time reverse transcriptase PCR (RT-PCR) is the gold standard for diagnosing COVID-19. Turnaround Time : The average time from sample receipt to result generation is approximately 4-5 hours. Capacity : Can process up to 90 samples in a single run, making it efficient for frontline testing. Gene Targets : Screening (Genus Specific) : Spike protein (S) Envelope protein (E) Membrane protein (M) Nucleocapsid protein (N) Confirmation (Species Specific for SARS-CoV-2) : RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) Open reading frames (ORF1a/b) N2 nucleocapsid Principle of Testing : Qualitative real-time PCR amplifies target genes in the specimen using a thermocycler. Fluorescence is generated when the amplicon binds to the probe, with the cycle threshold (Ct) indicating positivity. A sample is considered positive if both screening and confirmatory genes are detected with a Ct value ≤ 40 cycles. Detectability : NAAT can be positive as early as day 1 of symptom onset (usually 5 days post-infection) and generally declines by the third week, often becoming undetectable thereafter. Automated Real-Time RT-PCR Systems include Truenat and CBNAAT (Cartridge-based nucleic acid amplification test, e.g., GeneXpert). Widely accessible Turnaround Time : Quick results in 30-60 minutes. Automation : Fully automated with minimal handling, reducing biosafety hazards. Gene Targets : CBNAAT : E gene for screening, N2 gene for confirmation. Truenat : E gene for screening, RdRp gene for confirmation. Disadvantages : Limited to 1-4 samples per run, suitable for low sample loads (24-48 samples/day). Antigen Detection Rapid chromatographic immunoassay (SD Biosensor) for qualitative detection of SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid protein. Sample Collection : Nasopharyngeal swab immersed in viral extraction buffer to inactivate the virus and release the antigen. Point-of-Care Testing : Conducted at the bedside within one hour; antigen stability is limited to one hour. Performance : Highly specific (99–100%) but moderate sensitivity (50–84%); symptomatic but negative patients should be referred for RT-PCR testing. Blood Findings: Increased IL-6 Levels : This suggests a cytokine storm. Elevated D-dimer : Indicates high levels of fibrin degradation products, suggesting an underlying coagulopathy. Raised Serum Ferritin : This is a marker of inflammation. Severe Lymphopenia : Indicates a significant reduction in lymphocyte count. Increased",

      "question": "Which of the following is amplified in an RT-PCR test for the COVID-19 virus?",
      "options": {
        "A": "RNA",
        "B": "DNA",
        "C": "Structural protein",
        "D": "Envelope"
      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer B - DNA Explanation: In an RT-PCR (Reverse Transcription PCR) test for COVID-19, the RNA of the virus is first reverse-transcribed into DNA by the enzyme reverse transcriptase . This step is essential because PCR (Polymerase Chain Reaction) works with DNA , not RNA. The RNA is converted into complementary DNA (cDNA), which is then amplified in the PCR process to detect the presence of the virus.

Performance : Highly specific (99–100%) but moderate sensitivity (50–84%); symptomatic but negative patients should be referred for RT-PCR testing. Incorrect Options: RNA (Option A): In an RT-PCR test for COVID-19, the viral RNA is converted into complementary DNA (cDNA) using reverse transcriptase enzyme. This cDNA is then amplified through PCR. Structural Protein (Option C): Structural proteins are components of the virus, but they are not the target of RT-PCR testing. RT-PCR is designed to detect and amplify the genetic material of the virus. Envelope (Option D) : The envelope is a protein that is part of the virus structure. However, the envelope protein itself is not directly amplified in RT-PCR. The test targets the viral RNA, not the proteins.
