Infective form: Mature cyst Transmission: Feco oral route. Habitat: Mucosa of duodenum and upper ileum. Ingesting a minimum of 10 cysts can cause an infection in a person. Within half an hour of ingestion, the cyst hatches out into two trophozoites, which multiply successively by binary fission and colonise the duodenum. During unfavorable condition , encystment occurs and cyst are passed in stool and remain viable in soil and water for several weeks. Life cycle : Host (only human) → Contaminated food and water (faeco-oral route) → Cyst (ingested form) → excystation occurs → Trophozoite. Diagnosis: Sample: Stool Microscopy: Cyst and trophozoite are seen. Trophozoite: 2 nuclei and four pairs of flagella with pear-shaped or tennis racket-shaped. Cyst: 1-4 nuclei and no flagella. String test: A capsule will have a string, and the capsule is swallowed, then the capsule goes to duodenum and dissolves, then the string is pulled back and, a microscopic examination is done. Duodenal biopsy: Giardia lamblia is a luminal organism Organisms hanging in the lumen Sickle shaped organism is seen. Falling leaf motility is shown. Treatment: Metronidazole Tinidazole (single dose of 2g) Trichomonas vaginalis (Option B) The trophozoite of Trichomonas is a pyriform or oval-shaped organism with 4 flagella on the anterior end, and 5th flagella remain folded on the outer surface of the undulating membrane.

      "explanation": "method. It involves injecting the thorax of Aedes mosquitoes (the vector for dengue virus) with blood from a patient suspected to have dengue. The mosquitoes are then observed for viral replication and transmission, which can help confirm the diagnosis. Xenodiagnosis: Xenodiagnosis is a diagnostic technique in which live vectors or organisms are used to detect the presence of an infectious agent in a host. This is particularly useful for detecting pathogens that are difficult to isolate or grow in a laboratory setting. Rabbit ileal loop assay for ETEC (Option A) This method involves introducing a loop of rabbit ileum (part of the small intestine) into the lumen of the gastrointestinal tract and assessing the effects of enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli (ETEC) on the loop. Injecting a hamster with splenic biopsy for diagnosis of leishmaniasis (Option C) It involves injecting a hamster with a biopsy specimen from the spleen to diagnose leishmaniasis. The hamster serves as a host for the parasite, but it is not a different species used for diagnosis. Intradermal test on guinea pigs for toxigenicity of Corynebacterium diphtheria (Option D) It involves conducting an intradermal test on guinea pigs to assess the toxigenicity of Corynebacterium diphtheriae. The guinea pigs are used as a model to evaluate the effects of the toxin, but they are not a different species used for diagnosis. Reference: https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7425851/",

      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: A) Fasciola hepatica are seen in the intrahepatic biliary radicles Explanation: Fasciola Hepatica Fasciola hepatica, commonly known as the liver fluke, is a parasitic trematode (flatworm) that primarily infects the livers of various mammals, including humans. It causes the disease fascioliasis, leading to liver damage, biliary obstruction , and inflammatory reactions. Morphology Adult Fluke: Shape: Leaf-shaped, flat, and broad. Size: Approximately 2-3 cm in length and 1 cm in width. Color: Typically brown or grey. Distinctive Features: Cone-shaped anterior end. Two suckers, an oral sucker at the front and a ventral sucker close to it, used for attachment to host tissues. The fluke’s body is covered by a tegument (a protective outer layer) with spines aiding in attachment. Eggs: Size: Large, oval, and approximately 130-150 µm in length. Color: Yellowish-brown. Characteristics: Each egg has an operculum (a lid-like structure) at one end, which opens to release the miracidium (the larval stage). Eggs are unembryonated when passed out in feces. Life Cycle Eggs in Water Eggs are expelled in the feces of infected mammals (definitive hosts). Under suitable environmental conditions, miracidia are released from eggs after 9–15 days. Infection of Snails (Intermediate Host) Miracidia penetrate specific freshwater snails, such as Lymnaea spp. Inside the snail, they progress through stages: sporocyst, redia, and eventually cercaria. Release and Encystment Cercariae exit the snail and encyst on aquatic vegetation, transforming into metacercariae, the infective stage. Infection of Mammals (Definitive Host) Mammals, including humans, become infected by consuming contaminated water or vegetation with metacercariae. In the duodenum, metacercariae excyst, penetrate the intestinal wall, migrate to the liver, and lodge in the bile ducts, maturing into adult flukes. Clinical Presentation Acute Phase (Invasive or Hepatic Stage): Duration: Begins about 2-3 weeks post-infection and may last for several months. Symptoms: Fever, right upper quadrant abdominal pain. Hepatomegaly (enlarged liver), and occasionally jaundice. Nausea, vomiting, and weight loss. Eosinophilia (elevated eosinophil count in blood). Chronic Phase (Biliary Stage): Duration: Occurs months to years post-infection. Symptoms: Biliary colic, obstructive jaundice, and cholangitis (inflammation of the bile ducts). Gallbladder symptoms, liver abscesses, and secondary bacterial infections in severe cases. Possible fibrosis of the bile ducts with prolonged infection. Investigations Serology: ELISA for detection of anti-Fasciola antibodies (sensitive in both acute and chronic infections). Immunoblotting can also confirm the diagnosis. Stool Examination: Microscopic detection of eggs in stool samples; however, eggs are typically not present in the acute phase and may be difficult to detect in chronic cases. Imaging: Ultrasound: Useful in detecting hepatobiliary abnormalities such as bile duct dilation or liver abscesses. CT/MRI: May show liver lesions or track the migration of larvae in the liver. Blood Tests: Eosinophilia is common in the acute phase. Liver function tests: Elevated liver enzymes, especially in chronic disease. Management Antiparasitic Treatment: Triclabendazole: The drug of choice, effective against both adult and larval stages. Dosage: Oral dose of 10-12 mg/kg, with a repeat dose after 12 hours if needed. Alternative Medications: Bithionol: Sometimes used if triclabendazole is unavailable. Incorrect Options: Schistosoma are Monoecious (Option B) Schistosoma is dioecious, i.e., males and females are separate. Fasciola Hepatica is not acquired",

      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: A) Sandfly Explanation: The patient described with symptoms like fever , pallor , hepatosplenomegaly , pancytopenia , and a peripheral smear showing macrophages laden with organisms containing a kinetoplast is most likely infected with Leishmania species, which cause visceral leishmaniasis (also known as Kala-azar ). The organism observed in the smear (with a kinetoplast) is characteristic of Leishmania amastigotes. Sandflies are the vector responsible for transmitting Leishmania species, including Leishmania donovani , which is the causative agent of visceral leishmaniasis in India, including Uttar Pradesh. Life Cycle of Leishmania donovani Infection of the Vector: A female sandfly (e.g., Phlebotomus , Lutzomyia ) bites an infected mammal and ingests blood containing amastigotes . Development in the Sandfly: Inside the sandfly’s midgut , amastigotes transform into promastigotes , which multiply and migrate to the proboscis. Transmission to the Mammalian Host: When the sandfly bites a new host, it injects the infective promastigotes . Transformation in the Host: Promastigotes are engulfed by macrophages and transform into amastigotes , which are non-flagellated and replicate intracellularly. Replication and Dissemination: Amastigotes multiply within macrophages, causing cell lysis and releasing new amastigotes to infect other macrophages. Transmission Back to the Sandfly: If an uninfected sandfly bites the infected host, it ingests amastigotes, and the cycle continues. Clinical features of kala-azar: Onset: Insidious. The clinical illness begins with high-grade fever which may be remittent with twice daily spikes or intermittent or less commonly continuous. Night sweats Splenomegaly starts early and is progressive and massive. It is usually soft and nontender. Hepatomegaly is moderate. Lymphadenopathy is common in most endemic areas except the Indian subcontinent. Skin becomes dry, rough and darkly pigmented (hence, the name kala-azar). The hair becomes thin and brittle. Cachexia with marked anaemia, emaciation and weight loss is seen. Hematological abnormalities: Anemia is most always present and is usually severe leukopenia , thrombocytopenia is associated with epistaxis, gum bleeding, gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding. Ascites and edema may occur due to hypoalbuminemia. Renal involvement is also common. In the late stage of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection, VL can present as an opportunistic infection. HIV coinfection rate is 5% in India and 20% in African countries. Secondary infections such as herpes, measles, pneumonia, tuberculosis, and bacillary dysentery may occur. Most untreated patients die in about two years due to some intercurrent disease such as dysentery, diarrhoea and tuberculosis.

      "explanation": "Correct Answer: C) Strongylodes stercoralis Explanation: Strongyloides stercoralis is a parasitic nematode that can cause strongyloidiasis . It is known to produce larvae that can be detected in a bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) specimen. The patient's history of chronic steroid use is significant, as steroids can lead to immunosuppression, which in turn can lead to dissemination of Strongyloides stercoralis . Strongyloides stercoralis typically causes a chronic, indolent infection , which can worsen during immunosuppression or steroid therapy . This can lead to dissemination , causing symptoms like respiratory distress and eosinophilia , which are consistent with the patient's presentation of acute worsening of respiratory symptoms, nocturnal cough, and elevated eosinophils. Strongyloidiasis can involve the lungs as larvae migrate through the lungs before being coughed up and swallowed, which explains the respiratory symptoms. Rhabditiform larva Filariform larva 1st stage of the larva (L1). 3d stage of the larva (L3). Formed when eggs hatch in the small intestine. Developed from two molts of the L1 larva. Measures approximately 0.25 mm in length with a short muscul’ar double-bulb esophagus . Measures about 0.55 mm in length, characterized by a long, slender shape, uniform esophagus & notched tail . Found in feces . Seen in hyperinfection & disseminated infection may show in sputum, stool and body fluids.

        "D": "Continue antiepileptics"
      },
      "correct_answer": "D",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: D) Continue antiepileptics Explanation: Multiple calcified parenchymal cysts on CT head are characteristic of Neurocysticercosis (NCC) in the inactive (calcified) stage. Seizures in calcified NCC are caused by gliotic scarring rather than active infection, so the p rimary treatment is antiepileptic therapy. Antiparasitic drugs (Albendazole, Praziquantel) are ineffective in the calcified stage and can worsen inflammation. Steroids are used only if perilesional edema is present, but they do not alter the course of calcified cysts. The combination of albendazole and praziquantel is recommended for effective treatment of multiple viable cysts (>2 cysts). Treatment of Neurocysticercosis Seizure Management : Anticonvulsant therapy is initiated upon seizure presentation. Stop if follow-up imaging shows resolution and no seizures for 24 months. Anthelmintic Therapy : Depends on the lesion stage. Cystic Lesions Treatment : Albendazole : Drug of choice for parenchymal Neurocysticercosis (15 mg/kg daily for 10-14 days). Recommended for 1-2 parenchymal cysts. Praziquantel : Alternative option (50 mg/kg in 3 divided doses daily for 10 days). Albendazole + Praziquantel : For >2 viable cysts (Praziquantel: 50 mg/kg/day for 10-14 days). Prednisolone: 10 mg three times daily for 14 days, starting 1 day before Albendazole or Praziquantel. Given to suppress the inflammation during the natural course of the disease. Stages of Cysts : Viable Cysts : Treated with anticysticidal therapy. Vesicular & Colloidal Stages : Treated with anticysticidal therapy. Granulonodular Stage : Some experts recommend treatment. Calcified Lesions : Do not require treatment with anticysticidal therapy. Small, Solitary Cerebral Cysts : Often resolve without treatment. Operative Intervention : Indicated for hydrocephalus.

Scrub typhus Causative agent Orientia tsutsugamushi - It differs from Rickettsia both genetically and by its cell wall composition i.e. it lacks lipopolysaccharide layer . Vector Chiggers (larvae of trombiculid mite) Pathophysiology Scrub typhus is so named because it occurs in areas of scrub vegetation i.e. low lying trees and bushes. It is transmitted by the bite of infected trombiculid mites. Among all stages of mite, the larvae (called chiggers) are the only stage that feed on humans . Hence, scrub typhus is also called chiggerosis . Mites can maintain the organisms through transovarial transmission . Orientia tsutsugamushi infects mononuclear cells but still produces fever and rash. Clinical features The classic presentation of scrub typhus consists of triad of an eschar (at the site of bite), regional lymphadenopathy and maculopapular rash sparing palms and soles.

      "explanation": "Correct Answer: D) Ascaris lumbricoides Explanation: The given image shows Ascaris lumbricoides. The female Ascaris lumbricoides is identified by a straight conical posterior end & a vulvar groove, distinguishing it from the male, which has a ventrally curved posterior end. Females are also larger, measuring 20-40 cm, compared to males at 15-30 cm Roundworm (Ascaris lumbricoides) Habitat Adult worms reside in the small intestine (85% in the jejunum and 15% in the ileum) and are the largest nematode parasites in humans. Morphology Adult Worms : Large, cylindrical, with tapering ends and pale pink color that turns white outside the body. Male Worms : Smaller than females (15-30 cm long, 2-4 mm thick) A ventrally curved posterior end and two copulatory spicules. Female Worms : Larger than males Straight , conical posterior end & a vulvar groove aiding in mating. Reproduction A single female can lay up to 200,000 eggs daily, which are expelled in the feces.

Incorrect Options: Strongyloides stercoralis (Option A) : This nematode is much smaller and thread-like. It primarily affects the small intestine and is diagnosed via larvae in stool rather than large adult worms. It can cause autoinfection, leading to hyperinfection syndrome in immunocompromised individuals. Enterobius vermicularis (Option B): Also known as the pinworm, it is much smaller (~1 cm) and resides in the perianal region. It causes perianal itching (especially at night), and diagnosis is confirmed using the Scotch tape test to detect eggs. Ancylostoma duodenale (Option C): This is a hookworm, characterized by its curved morphology and cutting plates/teeth. It causes iron deficiency anemia due to chronic blood loss in the intestines.

      "explanation": "Correct Answer: B) Night blood test for worms Explanation: The northeastern part of the country is endemic for lymphatic filariasis (Wuchereria bancrofti, Brugia malayi), which causes proximal limb lymphedema due to lymphatic obstruction. Microfilariae exhibit nocturnal periodicity, making a night blood test the preferred initial investigation. Filariasis: Agent: Wucheria bancrofti: Lymphatic filariasis Brugia malayi: Brugian/Malayan filariasis Endemic areas: Bihar, Jharkhand, Uttar Pradesh, Kerala, Gujarat Host: Definitive: Man Secondary/ intermediate: Culex quinquefasciatus or fatigans Mode of Transmission: Bite of the mosquito (vector) W. bancrofti: Culex quinquefasciatus or fatigans (polluted water) B. malayi: Mansonia (ponds, lakes) Incubation period: 8-16 months. Transmission: Cyclodevelopmental Clinical features: Asymptomatic amicrofilariae: No symptoms, smear-negative Asymptomatic microfilariae: No symptoms, smear-positive Acute stage (few months): Fever, lymphadenitis, epididymo-orchitis. Chronic Obstructive stage (>10 years): Hydrocele, chyluria, elephantiasis Occult stage: Tropical pulmonary eosinophilia (hypersensitivity reaction) with absent microfilariae Life Cycle of Filaria (Wuchereria bancrofti, Brugia malayi): Lab Diagnosis: 1. Demonstration of Microfilaria: In blood, chylous urine, exudate of lymph varix or hydrocele fluid. Best collect night blood samples between 10pm and 4 am. Microfilaria can be seen in unstained as well as stained specimens. Staining is performed using Giemsa, Leishman, or polychrome methylene blue. Concentration Techniques: Done if microfilaria density is low Knott’s concentration technique Nucleopore filtration Diethylcarbamazine provocation test (DCT): Small dose of DEC given (2 mg/kg body weight) Forces microfilaria to appear in peripheral blood during daytime. Quantitative buffy coat 2. Ultrasonography: Identify motile adult worms in the scrotum and female breast within dilated lymphatics, known as the \"filaria dance sign.\" 3. Hemogram: Eosinophilia Elevated serum IgE levels 4. Demonstration of Antibody: Cannot distinguish between current and past infections. 5. Demonstration of Circulating Antigen: Highly sensitive and specific Trop-bio test: Semiquantitative sandwich ELISA ELISA: To detect specific IgG4 antibody against W.bancrofti antigen ( WbSXP-1 ) Immunochromatographic test (ICT): Detects soluble W.bancrofti antigen using monoclonal antibody ( AD12 ) in serum. Treatment: Drug of Choice: Diethylcarbamazine (DEC) Mass drug therapy is given as either: DEC alone DEC + Albendazole DEC + Ivermectin Echocardiography (Option A): Cardiac conditions such as heart failure or superior vena cava (SVC) syndrome can cause limb swelling. However, these usually present with bilateral swelling and additional systemic symptoms. Given the patient's regional background and asymmetric proximal swelling, filariasis is a more likely cause. Duplex venous scan of limbs (Option C): A venous scan is useful in detecting deep vein thrombosis (DVT), which typically causes distal rather than proximal limb swelling. In this case, lymphatic obstruction is a more likely cause. ECG (Option D): Although the patient has a history of coronary artery disease, ECG does not",

Microsporidia (Option C): Causes chronic diarrhea in immunocompromised patients (e.g., HIV/AIDS). Not typically seen in the duodenum; would show spore forms on histology, but not characteristic of the watery diarrhea here. Cryptosporidia (Option D): Cryptosporidium is a protozoan parasite that can cause watery diarrhoea, especially in immunocompromised individuals. The organisms are typically small, round oocysts.

        "D": "Strongyloides stercoralis"
      },
      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer A - Enterobius vermicularis Explanation: The parasite infestation in the given scenario is of Enterobius vermicularis or the pinworm which causes intense itching in the perianal region due to the female worm laying eggs in this region at night. The infective stage of this is the embryonated egg . The eggs are often observed on the perianal skin, and when the child scratches the area, they can spread the eggs to others or other surfaces. The eggs are colorless and not bile-stained Enterobius vermicularis / Pinworm / Threadworm Epidemiology: The most common age group being school children . Infections can persist for years due to auto-infective cycles . Factors contributing to infection include: Overcrowding Impaired hygiene Poor personal care practices (such as nail-biting and inadequate handwashing). Morphology Adult worm The adults are short, white, and fusiform, resembling bits of white thread. The mouth is surrounded by three wing-like structures called cervical alae, which are transversely striated. Female worm Females are long. The posterior third tapers into a thin, pointed, pin-like tail. Females are oviparous. Male worm The posterior end is tightly curved ventrally, sharply truncated, and has a prominent copulatory spicule. Eggs The eggs are colorless and not bile-stained They float in saturated salt solution and have an elongated ovoid shape. Each egg contains a tadpole-shaped, coiled embryo that becomes infectious only 6 hours after being deposited . Scotch-tape test: A piece of clear tape is pressed against the skin around the anus to collect eggs, typically overnight. The tape is then examined under a microscope for pinworm eggs. Life cycle: Enterobius vermicularis spends the entire lifecycle in humans . It has no intermediate hosts and does not undergo systemic migration. The eggs hatch in the intestine, and the larvae enter the caecum and mature into adults. The male worm does not migrate and most often dies after mating and is passed in the feces. The female worm migrates to the rectum from the colon and travels to the perianal skin at night to lay its sticky eggs and dies after laying all eggs or gets crushed due to scratching. Pathogenicity: The embryonated egg is the infective form. The disease thus caused is called enterobiasis, which is more common in children than in adults. It affects females > males. The infection occurs in two ways: Exogenous autoinfection is where the eggs are transferred from the perianal region to the mouth by nails after scratching the region. Endogenous autoinfection/retro-infection is where the larva migrates retrograde and travels back into the colon after hatching in the perianal skin. Incorrect Options: Trichuris trichiura (Option B) (whipworm): While whipworms can infect the intestines, they are not typically associated with perianal itching or the nocturnal symptoms described. Their main symptoms involve abdominal pain, diarrhea, and occasionally rectal prolapse. Trichinella spiralis (Option C) : This parasite causes trichinosis , which is typically associated with consuming undercooked pork or wild game. The primary symptoms are muscle pain and swelling, not perianal itching. Strongyloides stercoralis (Option D) : This parasite causes strongyloidiasis , which typically presents with symptoms like abdominal pain , diarrhea , and skin rashes , but not specifically with perianal itching .",

Malarial control refers to the efforts and strategies aimed at reducing the burden of malaria and its impact on public health. The ultimate goal of malarial control is to eliminate malaria as a public health problem. This involves reducing the number of malaria cases to a level where it no longer poses a significant threat to the population. Incorrect options: Option B. \"To reduce the mortality to zero,\" focuses specifically on reducing the number of deaths caused by malaria. While reducing malaria-related mortality is an important aspect of malarial control, it does not encompass the entirety of the control measures. C. Option C. \"To prevent local transmission for 3 days,\" is a limited objective and does not encompass the broader goal of malarial control. Malaria control efforts aim to achieve sustained and long-term reductions in transmission, not just for a short period of time. D. Option D. \"To reduce indices to zero,\" is not a comprehensive description of malarial control. Malarial vector indices, such as mosquito density and parasite prevalence, are important indicators used to monitor and guide control efforts, but reducing these indices to zero may not always be achievable or necessary for effective control.

In the lungs, they molt to L4, migrate to the pharynx, and are swallowed back into the intestine. Intestinal Phase L4 larvae become adult worms in the small intestine. Females lay fertilized eggs in feces; unfertilized eggs may also be laid. Development in Soil Fertilized eggs become infective embryonated (L2 larvae) in 2 weeks under suitable conditions. Unfertilized eggs disintegrate and are non-infective. Embryonated eggs can survive for up to 15 years due to a thick eggshell and ascaroside, a resistant lipoprotein. Pathogenesis and Clinical Features Caused by the host immune response, larval migration, adult worm obstruction, and nutritional deficiencies. Incubation : 60–70 days. Pulmonary Phase Symptoms appear within two weeks post-ingestion: cough, chest discomfort, and fever. Severe cases may lead to Loeffler’s syndrome , characterized by eosinophilic pneumonia and transient lung infiltrates. Intestinal Phase Most infections are asymptomatic, but malnutrition and growth retardation can occur, particularly in children <5 years. Complications include intestinal obstruction, perforation, intussusception, or volvulus in older children.

      "explanation": "as the liver fluke, is a parasitic trematode (flatworm) that primarily infects the livers of various mammals, including humans. It causes the disease fascioliasis, leading to liver damage, biliary obstruction, and inflammatory reactions. Morphology Adult Fluke: Shape: Leaf-shaped, flat, and broad. Size: Approximately 2-3 cm in length and 1 cm in width. Color: Typically brown or grey. Distinctive Features: Cone-shaped anterior end. Two suckers, an oral sucker at the front and a ventral sucker close to it, used for attachment to host tissues. The fluke’s body is covered by a tegument (a protective outer layer) with spines aiding in attachment. Eggs: Size: Large, oval, and approximately 130-150 µm in length. Color: Yellowish-brown. Characteristics: Each egg has an operculum (a lid-like structure) at one end, which opens to release the miracidium (the larval stage). Eggs are unembryonated when passed out in feces. Life Cycle Eggs in Water Eggs are expelled in the feces of infected mammals (definitive hosts). Under suitable environmental conditions, miracidia are released from eggs after 9–15 days. Infection of Snails (Intermediate Host) Miracidia penetrate specific freshwater snails, such as Lymnaea spp. Inside the snail, they progress through stages: sporocyst, redia, and eventually cercaria. Release and Encystment Cercariae exit the snail and encyst on aquatic vegetation, transforming into metacercariae, the infective stage. Infection of Mammals (Definitive Host) Mammals, including humans, become infected by consuming contaminated water or vegetation with metacercariae. In the duodenum, metacercariae excyst, penetrate the intestinal wall, migrate to the liver, and lodge in the bile ducts, maturing into adult flukes. Clinical Presentation Acute Phase (Invasive or Hepatic Stage): Duration: Begins about 2-3 weeks post-infection and may last for several months. Symptoms: Fever, right upper quadrant abdominal pain. Hepatomegaly (enlarged liver), and occasionally jaundice. Nausea, vomiting, and weight loss. Eosinophilia (elevated eosinophil count in blood). Chronic Phase (Biliary Stage): Duration: Occurs months to years post-infection. Symptoms: Biliary colic, obstructive jaundice, and cholangitis (inflammation of the bile ducts). Gallbladder symptoms, liver abscesses, and secondary bacterial infections in severe cases. Possible fibrosis of the bile ducts with prolonged infection. Investigations Serology: ELISA for detection of anti-Fasciola antibodies (sensitive in both acute and chronic infections). Immunoblotting can also confirm the diagnosis. Stool Examination: Microscopic detection of eggs in stool samples; however, eggs are typically not present in the acute phase and may be difficult to detect in chronic cases. Imaging: Ultrasound: Useful in detecting hepatobiliary abnormalities such as bile duct dilation or liver abscesses. CT/MRI: May show liver lesions or track the migration of larvae in the liver. Blood Tests: Eosinophilia is common in the acute phase. Liver function tests: Elevated liver enzymes, especially in chronic disease. Management Antiparasitic Treatment: Triclabendazole: The drug of choice, effective against both adult and larval stages. Dosage: Oral dose of 10-12 mg/kg, with a repeat dose after 12 hours if needed. Alternative Medications: Bithionol: Sometimes used if triclabendazole is unavailable.",

Echinococcus granulosus Other name Dog tapeworm Definitive Host Dog (optimal host), wolf, jackal and fox Intermediate Host Sheep and cattle Accidental Intermediate Host Man (Harbors larval stage, not adult form) Infective Form Embryonated egg Mode of Infection Ingestion of the eggs due to: Intimate handling of infected dogs Eating raw vegetables or other food items contaminated with dog feces Eggs Ovoid in shape and brown in color Contains an embryo with three pairs of hooklets Larva Represent structure of scolex of adult worm and remains invaginated within a vesicular body. Adult Worm Consist of scolex, a short neck and strobila Scolex is pyriform, with four suckers and prominent rostellum bearing two circular rows of hooklets. Life Cycle: Hydatid Cyst Hydatid cysts are parasitic cysts caused by Echinococcus granulosus. Commonly Affected Organs Liver (most common site, about 60-70% of cases) Lungs (second most common site) Other organs (rare but possible): Brain, spleen, kidneys, bones, and peritoneum Clinical Features: Asymptomatic Phase: Common due to slow cyst growth. Symptomatic Phase: Liver Involvement: Mostly right lobe; Abdominal pain, hepatomegaly, obstructive jaundice, portal hypertension. Lung Involvement: Cough, chest pain, dyspnea, hemoptysis, pneumothorax. Layers of a hydatid cyst Layer Name Origin Description Main Function Outer Layer Pericyst Host-derived Thick fibrous layer created by the host's inflammatory response around the cyst. Eventually it develops into a dense fibrous capsule which may even calcify. Provides structural support and isolates the cyst from surrounding tissues. Middle Layer Ectocyst (Laminated Membrane) Parasite-derived Acellular,chitinous, laminated hyaline layer secreted by the parasite. Has the appearance of the white of a hard boiled egg. Acts as a barrier against host immune cells and protects the inner germinal layer. Inner Layer Endocyst (Germinal Layer) Parasite-derived Thin cellular layer lining the cyst interior. Consist of a number of nuclei embedded in a protoplasmic mass. Vital layer of the cyst. Site of asexual reproduction giving rise to brood capsules with scolices. Also secrete hydatid fluid, which fills the cyst. Entamoeba histolytica (Option B) : This protozoan causes amoebic liver abscesses , which can also lead to right upper quadrant pain. However, the cysts in amoebic infections are typically unilocular , not multilocular, and are usually associated with a history of dysentery or diarrhea . Strongyloides stercoralis (Option C) : This is a parasitic roundworm that causes strongyloidiasis and may lead to abdominal pain and diarrhea. However, it does not typically cause multilocular cysts in the liver. Ancylostoma duodenale (Option D) : This hookworm is associated with hookworm infection , causing symptoms like anemia and abdominal discomfort , but it does not lead to liver cysts.",

      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: C) Cytoadherence Explanation: The patient’s symptoms, including fever, confusion, and neurological deficits, along with the travel history to Africa, suggest a Plasmodium falciparum infection, which is the causative agent of severe malaria . Plasmodium falciparum has a specific property that facilitates its sequestration in the microvasculature, especially in organs like the brain (leading to cerebral malaria), by adhering to the endothelial cells of blood vessels. This process is known as cytoadherence . Plasmodium falciparum is the primary species associated with cytoadherence , where infected red blood cells adhere to endothelial cells in blood vessels. This leads to complications like cerebral malaria due to vessel blockage and reduced blood flow. Pathogenesis of Malignant Malaria: Cytoadherence: In Plasmodium falciparum malaria , late-stage schizonts secrete proteins that create knob-like protrusions on the surfaces of infected RBCs. This results in the expression of the adhesive protein PfEMP-1 (P. falciparum Erythrocyte Membrane Protein) , which makes the infected RBCs sticky. Inflammatory cytokines, particularly IFN- γ , enhance the expression of endothelial receptors such as thrombospondin, E-selectin, VCAM-1, and ICAM-1 in the brain, chondroitin sulfate B in the placenta, and CD36 in most other organs. These receptors promote the cytoadherence of infected RBCs to the endothelium , leading to blockage of capillaries and venules. Rosette formation: Infected RBCs can adhere to uninfected RBCs , forming rosettes . Auto-Agglutination: The phenomenon where parasitised red blood cells (RBCs) clump together These mechanisms cause capillary plugging and reduced microcirculation in vital organs, including the brain, kidneys, lungs, spleen, intestines, bone marrow, and placenta, resulting in severe complications like cerebral malaria.

      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: B) Entamoeba Histolytica Explanation: Entamoeba histolytica is a protozoan parasite that causes amoebiasis (also known as amoebic dysentery). It is transmitted through the ingestion of quadrinucleate cysts found in contaminated food or water. These cysts are ingested and then transform into trophozoites in the intestines, where they can cause symptoms ranging from mild diarrhea to severe dysentery and, in some cases, liver abscesses. E.histolytica causes amoebic dysentery and a wide range of other invasive diseases, including amoebic liver abscesses. Morphology: Has three stages: Trophozoite Precyst Cyst Life Cycle: Host: Single host, i.e. man. Infective form: Mature quadrinucleate cyst Mode of transmission: E. histolytica is transmitted by Feco-oral route (most common) Sexual (anogenital or orogenital) contact Very rarely by vectors (mechanical transmission from faeces). Development in Human Intestine: Small intestine: Undergoes excystation Large intestine: Multiplication and colonization. Manifestations: Asymptomatic cyst passers Amoebic dysentery Invasive amoebiasis Encystation: When the lesions start healing, and the patient improves, trophozoites transform into cysts and then into cysts in the large intestine, which are liberated in faeces. These cysts are infective. Giardia lamblia (Option A): The life cycle of Giardia lamblia involves ingestion of cysts from contaminated food or water. These cysts transform into trophozoites in the small intestine, multiply, and eventually form new cysts that are excreted in the feces to infect new hosts. This causes giardiasis. Cryptosporidium parvum (Option C) : This protozoan causes cryptosporidiosis, typically transmitted through contaminated water, but it does not involve quadrinucleate cysts. Cyclospora cayetanensis (Option D) : This parasite causes cyclosporiasis, which is also transmitted via contaminated food or water, but its cysts are not quadrinucleate.",

Electron microscopy reveals double-walled cysts, which are characteristic of Acanthamoeba. Infections caused by Acanthamoeba are typically observed in immunocompromised rather than immunocompetent individuals . Acanthamoeba: These species are free-living amoebae that infect CNS, skin and eye. Morphology: Cyst and trophozoite forms. There is no flagellated form. Infective form: Both cysts and trophozoites. Mode of transmission: Entry through inhalation, ingestion, and cutaneous/ ocular contaminated lens solution. It causes: GAE (granulomatous amoebic encephalitis) in immunocompromised patients. Keratitis among contact lens users. Granulomatous Amoebic Encephalitis (GAE) GAE has an insidious onset, and the incubation period varies from several weeks to months. Symptoms: Confusion, dizziness, nausea, headache, stiff neck and rarely seizure and hemiplegia. In HIV/immunocompromised patients: In addition to GAE, Acanthamoeba produces nasal ulcers, cutaneous ulcers and musculoskeletal abscesses. Pathology: Focal granulomatous lesions in the brain. CSF analysis: Lymphocytosis is seen. However, in patients with AIDS , no cells are seen in CSF. Diagnosis: Brain biopsy: shows trophozoites and cysts. Culture: NNA (Non-Nutrient Agar) – lawn culture of Escherichia coli. Molecular methods: Multiplex real-time PCR. Imaging method: CT scan or MRI reveals space-occupying or ring-enhancing lesions in the brain. Treatment: Pentamidine + Azole + Sulfonamide + Flucytosine.

      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "gastrointestinal symptoms such as diarrhea, abdominal cramps, bloating, and weight loss. The \"falling leaf\" motility pattern is a classic finding seen in Giardia infections. This motility pattern is due to the unique flagella arrangement of Giardia trophozoites. The fact that the patient drank untreated stream water during her camping trip makes Giardia infection a likely culprit, as it is transmitted via contaminated water sources. Incorrect Options: Option A - Salmonella typhi: Salmonella typhi is a bacterium that causes typhoid fever. It typically presents with fever, abdominal pain, headache, and constipation rather than diarrhea. The symptoms described in the scenario, including frequent diarrhea, abdominal cramps, and \"falling leaf\" motility in the stool, are not characteristic of Salmonella typhi infection. Option B - Entamoeba histolytica: Entamoeba histolytica is a protozoan parasite that causes amoebic dysentery. While it can lead to diarrhea, abdominal pain, and weight loss, the \"falling leaf\" motility is not a characteristic finding for Entamoeba histolytica. Additionally, there is no mention of bloody diarrhea or the presence of colonic ulcers, which are often associated with this infection. Option D - Cryptosporidium parvum: Cryptosporidium parvum is another protozoan parasite that causes diarrhea. However, the symptoms of cryptosporidiosis are generally more severe in immunocompromised individuals. The stool examination findings in cryptosporidiosis typically reveal oocysts, which are not described as \"falling leaf\" motility.",

The characteristic appearance seen is ‘Strawberry cervix,’ an erythematous and edematous cervical mucosa with characteristic punctate red papules. It is caused by microscopic punctate haemorrhages of the cervix. Symptoms include: Sudden, profuse, yellowish-green, frothy, foul-smelling discharge Irritation and itching in and around the vaginal opening Painful urination Pain during intercourse Recurrent infections Inflamed vulva Inflamed vaginal walls with small, punctate hemorrhages (\"strawberry cervix\") The standard treatment is Metronidazole 2g PO single dose. Incorrect Options: Trophozoite has 2 nuclei (Option A): Trichomonas vaginalis exists only as a trophozoite, which has a single nucleus and four anterior flagella, not two nuclei.

      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: A) Leishmania tropica Explanation: Leishmania tropica causes cutaneous leishmaniasis, also known as oriental sore, which is endemic in parts of Rajasthan. It presents as a chronic, non-healing ulcer with surrounding erythema. The amastigote form, seen on microscopy, has a characteristic dark-staining nucleus and kinetoplast inside macrophages. Leishmaniasis is a vector-borne disease caused by a protozoan species belonging to the genus Leishmania. It is transmitted by sand fly vectors. Clinical manifestations of Leishmaniasis vary, depending on the species, from cutaneous ulcers to systemic multiorgan disease. Mucocutaneous involvement can be seen in: a. Cutaneous Leishmaniasis (CL) I. Old world leishmaniasis - caused by L. major/ L. tropica II. New world leishmaniasis - caused by L. mexicana CL typically begins as a pink-coloured papule that enlarges, then develops into a nodule or plaque, finally forming a painless ulceration with an indurated border. Old World CL: The ulcer is often covered with hyperkeratotic eschar. The ulcer margins may be raised (volcano sign). New World CL: The ulcer may be covered with thick white-yellow fibrinous material. ‘Chiclero’s ulcer’ - multiple, small, chronic ulcers on the ear, due to multiple sandfly bites. b. Mucosal Leishmaniasis (ML) caused by L. braziliensis Characterized by mucosal destruction. The most commonly involved tissues include the nose, mouth, and nasal septum. Symptoms include nasal stuffiness and mucosal bleeding, while some experience pain and deformity. Substantial disfigurement can result. Incorrect Options: Babesia (Option B): Babesia is an intracellular parasite that affects red blood cells, causing malaria-like hemolytic anemia, fever, and thrombocytopenia, not skin ulcers. Trypanosoma cruzi (Option C): Trypanosoma cruzi causes Chagas disease, which presents with Romana's sign (unilateral periorbital swelling) and cardiomyopathy, rather than cutaneous ulcers. The trypomastigote form is seen in blood smears, not in tissue biopsy. Histoplasma (Option D): Histoplasma capsulatum is a fungus that primarily causes pulmonary infections. Though it can cause cutaneous lesions in disseminated histoplasmosis, it lacks the kinetoplast seen in protozoal parasites like Leishmania.",

Malaria Agent Plasmodium species Species Type Fever Cycle P.falciparum Malignant Tertian Malaria Every 48 hours P.vivax Benign Tertian Malaria Every 48 hours P.malariae Quartan Malaria Every 72 hours P.ovale Ovale Malaria Every 48 hours P. knowlesi Quotidian Malaria Every 24 hours (daily) Incubation Period: 7-30 days, depending on Plasmodium species Vector Female Anopheles mosquitoes Behavior: Nocturnal feeders; prefer to bite between dusk and dawn Breeding Sites: Stagnant water bodies such as ponds, marshes, swamps, and artificial containers Transmission Bites of infected female Anopheles mosquitoes Can be transmitted through blood transfusions and organ transplants. Host Humans (Primary Host) Higher risk in pregnant women, infants, and immunocompromised Anopheles mosquitoes (Vector and Intermediate host) Environmental Factors Climate: Warm and Humid environment Seasonality: Rainy seasons Geographical Distribution: Most prevalent in tropical and subtropical regions India: Endemic in several states, particularly in the northeastern states (Assam, Tripura, Meghalaya), Eastern states (Odisha, Jharkhand), and some parts of Maharashtra and Karnataka Incorrect Options: Plasmodium malariae (Option B) : P. malariae is not detected by HRP-2-based tests, as it lacks this antigen. Instead, it is diagnosed via microscopy or PCR. Plasmodium vivax (Option C): P. vivax is typically detected using lactate dehydrogenase (pLDH)-based RDTs, not HRP-2 tests. HRP-2 does not reliably detect P. vivax infections. Plasmodium ovale (Option D): Like P. vivax, P. ovale lacks HRP-2 and is not detected by HRP-2-based rapid tests. Its diagnosis depends on microscopy or PCR.

      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: C) Detection of microfilariae in the blood smear Explanation: A filarial antigen test is highly sensitive but does not differentiate between active and past infections. The next step is to confirm the presence of microfilariae in a peripheral blood smear, preferably collected at night (due to nocturnal periodicity of Wuchereria bancrofti). Thick and thin smears with Giemsa or Wright’s stain are used to visualize microfilariae. Diagnosis of filariasis 1. Thick blood film (Investigation of choice) Nocturnal microfilariae are seen in blood between 10 PM to 2 AM Lymphatic filariasis Brugian/Malayan filariasis Large, smooth (graceful) curve with countable nuclei Small, kinked at an acute angle with a long head and uncountable nuclei 2. Rapid Detection Test Also called the filarial strip test Used for monitoring , mapping, and evaluation activities 3. Membrane filter concentration method Most sensitive methods for detecting low-density microfilaraemia Require specialized equipment. 4. DEC provocation test: A single oral dose of 100mg DEC followed by blood smear after 1 hour Microfilariae can appear in the daytime. Highest specificity 5. Serological tests Cannot differentiate between past and present infection 6. Mass blood survey Thick blood films for epidemiological Survey Incorrect Options: Bone marrow biopsy (Option A): Filarial infections affect the lymphatic system and do not require a bone marrow biopsy. DEC provocation test (Option B): The Diethylcarbamazine (DEC) provocation test was historically used to stimulate microfilariae circulation, but it is rarely used today due to the availability of antigen detection tests. Ultrasound of the scrotum (Option D): Ultrasound of the scrotum (for \"Filarial Dance Sign\" - movement of microfilariae in dilated lymphatic channels) is useful if scrotal involvement or hydrocele is present, but it is not the first-line confirmatory test.",

        "D": "Continue antiepileptics"
      },
      "correct_answer": "D",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: D) Continue antiepileptics Explanation: Seizures due to calcified neurocysticercosis should be managed with long-term antiepileptic therapy (e.g., levetiracetam, phenytoin, or valproate). Antiparasitic drugs are not needed for calcified lesions. Multiple calcified parenchymal cysts on CT head are characteristic of neurocysticercosis (NCC) in the inactive (calcified) stage. Seizures in calcified NCC are caused by gliotic scarring rather than active infection, so the p rimary treatment is antiepileptic therapy. Antiparasitic drugs (Albendazole, Praziquantel) are ineffective in the calcified stage and can worsen inflammation. Steroids are used only if perilesional edema is present, but they do not alter the course of calcified cysts. The combination of albendazole and praziquantel is recommended for effective treatment of multiple viable cysts (>2 cysts). Treatment of Neurocysticercosis Seizure Management : Anticonvulsant therapy is initiated upon seizure presentation. Stop if follow-up imaging shows resolution and no seizures for 24 months. Anthelmintic Therapy : Depends on the lesion stage. Cystic Lesions Treatment : Albendazole : Drug of choice for parenchymal neurocysticercosis (15 mg/kg daily for 10-14 days). Recommended for 1-2 parenchymal cysts. Praziquantel : Alternative option (50 mg/kg in 3 divided doses daily for 10 days). Albendazole + Praziquantel : For >2 viable cysts (Praziquantel: 50 mg/kg/day for 10-14 days). Prednisolone: 10 mg three times daily for 14 days, starting 1 day before albendazole or praziquantel. Given to suppress the inflammation during the natural course of the disease. Stages of Cysts : Viable Cysts : Treated with anticysticidal therapy. Vesicular & Colloidal Stages : Treated with anticysticidal therapy. Granulonodular Stage : Some experts recommend treatment. Calcified Lesions : Do not require treatment with anticysticidal therapy. Small, Solitary Cerebral Cysts : Often resolve without treatment. Operative Intervention : Indicated for hydrocephalus.

      "explanation": "calcifications. FNAC or biopsy should never be done before nephrectomy in case of a hydatid cyst as it contains lots of hydatid fluid, which can produce an anaphylactic reaction in the patient. Management of Echinococcus granulosus Management is guided by the WHO classification (CE1-CE5) and depends on cyst stage, location, symptoms, and complication risk. Pharmacotherapy Albendazole and Praziquantel : Albendazole is the drug of choice for uncomplicated cysts, used to prevent recurrence and to reduce the size of the cyst before surgery or PAIR. Praziquantel serves as an adjunct therapy to enhance treatment efficacy. PAIR Technique (Puncture, Aspiration, Injection, Re-aspiration): Best mode of treatment of cysts Steps: Puncture: Insert needle into cyst under ultrasound or CT guidance. Aspiration: Partially aspirate cyst fluid to reduce pressure. Injection: Inject scolicidal agent (e.g., hypertonic saline, ethanol, cetrimide) into cyst. Reaspiration: Re-aspirate injected fluid to remove cyst contents and scolicidal agent. Minimally Invasive: Effective for unilocular cysts (CE1 and CE3a); involves puncturing and injecting a scolicidal agent. Advantages: Lower recurrence risk and shorter hospital stays. Contraindications: Not suitable for Cysts with extensive daughter cysts or at risk of rupture Calcified cyst Percutaneous Drainage (PERC): An alternative to PAIR for draining cysts without scolicidal agents. Surgical Management Cystectomy or Pericystectomy: For large, complicated, or ruptured cysts; it is preferred for CE2 and CE3b cysts or challenging anatomical locations. Watch and Wait: Inactive or Calcified Cysts (CE4 and CE5) can often be observed safely with regular imaging follow-up.",

      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: B) 1 and 3 Explanation: Saline Mount (Normal Saline Wet Mount) - Advantages: Motility of trophozoites (Statement 1) → Saline mount preserves the natural motility of protozoan trophozoites (e.g., Giardia lamblia shows \"falling leaf\" motility, Entamoeba histolytica shows directional motility). Differentiation of bile-stained vs non-bile-stained ova (Statement 3) → Saline mount allows observation of color differences, making it useful to distinguish bile-stained ova (e.g., Ascaris lumbricoides fertilized eggs) from non-bile-stained ones. Internal Structure of Cysts( Statement 3) → Iodine mount is better for cyst structures. Iodine stains the glycogen and nuclei of protozoan cysts, improving visualization of internal structures (e.g., Entamoeba histolytica, Giardia lamblia cysts). Saline mount does not enhance internal details well. Stool sample processing Microscopic examination of stool samples This is done by two methods: Direct wet mount examination Permanent staining methods Direct wet mount Preparation: Drops of saline and Lugol’s iodine are used on the left and right sides of the slide. Mix ~2 mg of feces to form a smooth suspension. Place a coverslip on the mount for examination under a microscope. Observation: Trophozoites Normal constituents of stool like plant fibers and starch cells can be seen Cellular Elements: Pus cells (in inflammatory diarrhea) Red blood cells (in dysentery) Charcot-Leyden Crystals Types of wet mounts: Saline mount: Uses: Detects trophozoites, cysts, helminth eggs, and larvae. Advantages: Demonstrates motility of trophozoites and larvae. Bile staining property can be assessed (bile-stained eggs appear golden brown). Iodine mount: Advantages: Better visualization of nuclear details in cysts, larvae, and eggs. Disadvantages: Iodine immobilizes and kills parasites , hindering motility observation. Bile staining property cannot be assessed. Permanent stained smears This method stains the internal structures. Purpose: For accurate detection of protozoan cysts and trophozoites. Common Stains: Iron-hematoxylin stain. Trichrome stain. Modified acid-fast stain for coccidian parasites (e.g., Cryptosporidium). Sedimentation techniques and Flotation techniques are concentration techniques used to recover low numbers of parasites in stool samples. Useful for epidemiological studies and assessing treatment response. Detects eggs, cysts, and larvae but does not detect trophozoites, as these get destroyed in the process . Sedimentation techniques : Eggs and cysts settle at the bottom due to higher density. Example: Formalin-ether concentration increases detection sensitivity by 8–10 times. Flotation techniques : Specimens are suspended in a denser medium (e.g., saturated salt solution) in which the eggs and cysts float. Limitations: Cannot concentrate non-floating parasites (e.g., unfertilized Ascaris eggs).",
