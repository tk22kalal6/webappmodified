      "explanation": "merozoites. These merozoites invade red blood cells, where they reproduce asexually, leading to the symptoms of malaria. Life Cycle of the Malaria Parasite: The malaria parasite completes its life cycle in two hosts: Definitive Host: Female Anopheles mosquito Intermediate Host: Humans The life cycle consists of two main phases: Asexual Phase (in Humans): Aka schizogony, this occurs in two locations: Erythrocytic Schizogony: Inside red blood cells (RBCs) Exoerythrocytic Schizogony: In liver cells (also called the tissue phase) Sexual Phase (in Mosquito): Sexual forms (gametocytes) develop in human RBCs, followed by maturation and fertilisation in the mosquito, leading to the formation of sporozoites through sporogony. Asexual Phase (Schizogony): Human Infection: Infection occurs via the bite of an infective female Anopheles mosquito. Sporozoites: These infective forms are present in the mosquito's salivary glands and are injected into the human bloodstream during feeding. Pre-erythrocytic Stage (Liver Phase): Sporozoites reach the liver, invade hepatocytes, and enlarge. They undergo multiple nuclear divisions, forming multinucleated schizonts (meronts) that contain 2,000 to 50,000 merozoites. Release of Merozoites: Mature liver schizonts rupture after 6-15 days, releasing merozoites into the bloodstream. Erythrocytic Stage: Merozoites invade RBCs via a process of invagination Development in RBCs: Inside the RBC, merozoites lose internal organelles and transform into ring forms (young trophozoites) , which feed on haemoglobin and produce malaria pigment (hemozoin). Maturation: Ring forms develop into late trophozoites and then into mature schizonts containing 8-32 merozoites, which are released upon rupture of the RBC Malaria Parasite\" data-author=\"\" data-hash=\"9625\" data-license=\"\" data-source=\"\" data-tags=\"\" height=\"640\" src=\"https://image.prepladder.com/notes/91TwpN2CgHbfM9zseW4R1744394484.png\" width=\"936\" /> Gametogony: After several erythrocytic cycles, some merozoites develop into sexually differentiated forms, the gametocytes. Sexual Phase (Sporogony): When a female Anopheles mosquito consumes parasitised blood, the gametocytes are released in the midgut: Development of gametes: Male gametocytes undergo division to produce microgametes, while female gametocytes mature into macrogametes. Fertilization: A microgamete fertilizes a macrogamete, forming a zygote. Ookinete formation: The zygote transforms into a motile ookinete penetrating the mosquito's stomach wall. Oocyst development: The ookinete develops into an oocyst, where sporozoites are produced. Mature oocyst: Once mature, the oocyst ruptures, releasing sporozoites into the mosquito’s hemocoel",

It is characterised by hemoglobinuria (dark-coloured urine), severe hemolytic anaemia , and jaundice . It results from the severe hemolysis of red blood cells , which releases free haemoglobin into the bloodstream and its subsequent excretion in the urine. Clinical Features and Complications of Malaria Benign malaria (Option A) Febrile paroxysms Cold phase : complaints of fatigue, headache, nausea, severe cold, shivering, and rigours. Hot phase : high-grade fever along with dry, hot skin. Sweating phase : this follows with a fall in the fever. The febrile episodes usually coincide with the erythrocytic schizogony. Cytokines like TNF, IL-1 and IFN have important role in the complications of malaria. Anemia Splenomegaly Malignant Tertian Malaria Cerebral malaria Hepatosplenomegaly, fever, nausea, headache Presents as diffuse symmetric encephalopathy after 4 to 5 days of high fever with confusion, seizures, paralysis, and coma. Transfusion malaria It occurs when malaria parasites are transmitted through contaminated blood transfusions (Trophozoites can be seen). Complications Black water fever Septicemic malaria : The presence of malaria parasites in the bloodstream, leading to systemic inflammation, septic shock, and multiple organ dysfunction. (Option B) Algid malaria : causes peripheral circulatory failure (option C) Pulmonary edema and ARDS Renal failure Hypoglycemia Severe anemia Hyperpyrexia Metabolic acidosis and shock Bleeding disturbances Hyperparasitemia. Tropical Splenomegaly syndrome : It is a benign condition due to polyclonal B-cell activation in patients with repeated malaria infection.

Pathogenesis of Malignant Malaria: Cytoadherence: In Plasmodium falciparum malaria , late-stage schizonts secrete proteins that create knob-like protrusions on the surfaces of infected RBCs. This results in the expression of the adhesive protein PfEMP-1 (P. falciparum Erythrocyte Membrane Protein) , which makes the infected RBCs sticky. Inflammatory cytokines, particularly IFN- γ , enhance the expression of endothelial receptors such as thrombospondin, E-selectin, VCAM-1, and ICAM-1 in the brain, chondroitin sulfate B in the placenta, and CD36 in most other organs.

Asexual Reproduction (Merogony) : Merogony occurs to produce meronts 1 and then 2, which contain multiple merozoites. 5. Release of Merozoites : The merozoites are released from the infected epithelial cells into the intestinal lumen. 6. Reinfection of Host Cells : The released merozoites can invade new intestinal epithelial cells, continuing the asexual reproduction cycle. 7. Sexual Reproduction (Gametogony) : Some merozoites differentiate into male (microgametes) and female (macrogametes) gametes within the host's intestinal cells 8. Fertilization and Oocyst Formation : The microgametes fertilise the macrogametes to form a zygote, which develops into an unsporulated oocyst. 9. Release of Oocysts : Unsporulated oocysts are excreted in the faeces of the infected host; thus, autoinfection is not possible (Option D) 10. Environmental Maturation : The oocysts sporulate in the environment and require a period of maturation before they become infective to another host. (Option A) 11.

Ingestion of Infective Oocysts : Humans or animals ingest fully mature (sporulated) oocysts from contaminated water, food, or surfaces. 2. Excystation : In the host’s small intestine, the oocyst releases four sporozoites, which then attach to the intestinal epithelial cells. (Option C) 3. Trophozoite Formation : The sporozoites develop into trophozoites within parasitophorous vacuoles (specialised compartments) in the brush border of the host’s intestinal cells. 4. Asexual Reproduction (Schizogony) : Trophozoites undergo asexual reproduction to form type I meronts, each containing eight merozoites. 5. Release of Merozoites : The merozoites are released, infect new epithelial cells, and may undergo schizogony again to form more type I meronts or transition into type II meronts. 6 . Sexual Reproduction (Gametogony) : Type II meronts release merozoites that invade cells and begin the sexual phase, differentiating into microgametes (male) and macrogametes (female). 7. Fertilization and Oocyst Formation : The microgamete fertilises the macrogamete, forming a zygote that then develops into an oocyst. 8. Sporulation : The zygote undergoes sporogony to form a fully mature, sporulated oocyst containing four sporozoites. 9. Release of Oocysts : Two types of oocysts are produced: Thick-walled oocysts: Excreted in faeces, they are mature and infective and transmit the infection to new hosts. (Option B) Thin-walled oocysts: Remain in the intestine and cause autoinfection, maintaining the cycle within the same host. (Option D) 10. Transmission : Thick-walled oocysts are released into the environment through faeces, where they can infect new hosts upon ingestion.

Infective form Trophozoite crosses the placenta to infect the neonate. Risk of transplacental infection based on time of infection of the mother Transplacental infection can occur at any tim e during the pregnancy, but the gestational age influences the risk of transmission (Option D). As the gestational age increases, the risk of transmission increases, but the severity of neonatal disease decreases. Pre-pregnancy (Option B) Very low chance of transmission (immunocompromised mother) First trimester Minimal risk of transmission (Option A). If transmitted, it results in more severe fetal complications. Third trimester Maximum risk of transmission (Option C). If transmitted, it is usually asymptomatic in newborns. First Trimester: Toxoplasmosis: High risk of severe fetal consequences if infection occurs early. Rubella: Greatest risk of congenital defects if contracted during the first trimester. CMV: Risk of transmission increases with gestational age but can lead to severe outcomes if contracted early. Second Trimester: Syphilis: Can be transmitted at any stage, but early detection and treatment are crucial to prevent fetal complications. Varicella Zoster Virus (VZV): Risk of congenital varicella syndrome is present if the mother contracts the virus during this period. Third Trimester: Herpes Simplex Virus (HSV): Primarily transmitted during delivery; however, maternal infection late in pregnancy poses a significant risk for neonatal herpes. Group B Streptococcus (GBS): Commonly associated with infections during labor and delivery rather than in utero transmission.
