        "D": "Herpes simplex virus"
      },
      "correct_answer": "D",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: D) Herpes simplex virus Explanation: The scenario of painful genital ulcers (as shown in the image above), flu-like symptoms, tender inguinal lymphadenopathy, and a history of multiple sexual partners is most likely indicative of a Herpes Simplex Virus Type 2 (HSV 2) infection. Genital lesions of HSV Mostly seen in HSV type 2. Bilateral, painful genital vesiculo-ulcerative lesions. Tender inguinal lymphadenopathy. Site: Lesions are mainly seen on, Males: The penis or in the urethra (urethritis). Females: The cervix, vagina, vulva and perineum It is associated with systemic features like fever (flu-like) and malaise. In pregnant females, a cesarean is preferred over normal labour to prevent vertical transmission. Haemophilus ducreyi (Option A) is a gram-negative bacillus that causes painful, non-indurated irregular ulcers on the genitalia (chancroid or soft sore) (which is not vesicular as seen in HSV 2, and there is no association of flu-like symptoms).",

      "explanation": "Correct Answer: C) Mollaret meningitis Explanation: The scenario presenting with seizures, aphasia, disorientation, confusion, fever, and positive PCR testing for HSV indicates a diagnosis of herpes simplex virus encephalitis caused by HSV-1. Mollaret meningitis is recurrent aseptic meningitis associated with HSV-2, not HSV-1. Clinical manifestations of Herpes simplex virus Cutaneous: Site: Face (cheeks, chin, around the mouth or on the forehead) Buttocks (infants as napkin rash) 'Fever blister' or herpes febrile or cold sores (viral reactivation in febrile patients) Herpetic whitlow : Occupational variety seen in doctors, dentists, and nurses. Eczema herpeticum : Generalised crops of vesicles appear in the affected area with widespread ulceration, as seen in children with eczema. Herpes gladiatorum (Wrestler’s herpes): In athletes who play skin-to-skin contact sports like wrestlers. Herpes multiforme (red, raised, target-like lesions on skin) Mucosal Site: Buccal mucosa (most common) Gingivostomatitis and pharyngitis (primary infection) (Option A) Recurrent herpes labialis (Option B) Ophthalmic Dendritic corneal ulcers (Option D) Corneal blindness and conjunctivitis are also observed Chorioretinitis and acute necrotising retinitis are rare. Nervous system Encephalitis (HSV Encephalitis) Caused by HSV-1 Most common cause of sporadic acute viral encephalitis Affected site: Temporal lobe Meningitis Most commonly caused by HSV-2 Mollaret meningitis (recurrent lymphocytic meningitis) (Option C) HSV can result in Bell's palsy. Visceral Symptoms like dysphagia, substernal pain and weight loss. Tracheobronchitis and pneumonitis (lung involvement) Genital infections Mostly seen in HSV type 2 Bilateral, painful genital vesiculo-ulcerative lesions Tender inguinal lymphadenopathy Site: Lesions are mainly seen on, Male: The penis or in the urethra (urethritis). Female: The cervix, vagina, vulva and perineum. Congenital If a pregnant woman has genital lesions during labour, the risk of infection can be mitigated by performing a cesarean section. Neonatal herpes : A disseminated disease involving multiple organs, with or without encephalitis. The mortality rate is high, and survivors may have neurological impairments. Transplacental infections leading to congenital malformations are rare.",

Treatment Ganciclovir (Drug of choice) Foscarnet (in Ganciclovir resistance) CMV immunoglobulins and Ganciclovir are given to bone marrow transplant patients. HHV 1 (Option A) is Herpes simplex virus 1 , which causes oral herpes (cold sores) and can commonly lead to encephalitis or herpes keratitis. It is not typically associated with the systemic symptoms, hepatomegaly, thrombocytopenia, or the presence of the PP65 antigen seen in the infant's case. HHV 2 (Option B), also known as Herpes simplex virus 2 , primarily causes genital herpes . While it can cause severe disease in newborns, especially during delivery (neonatal herpes), it does not typically present with the systemic symptoms described in this infant's presentation. Like HHV 1, it is not associated with the PP65 antigen. HHV 4 (Option C) is the Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), primarily associated with infectious mononucleosis and certain lymphoproliferative disorders. It does not show antibodies against the PP65 antigen.",

      "explanation": "Correct Answer: D) Acyclovir Explanation: The child's presentation of a painful blistering rash around the mouth, low-grade fever, irritability, and a history of recurrent cold sores suggests an outbreak of Herpes simplex virus (HSV) infection. Acyclovir is the first-line antiviral treatment for herpes simplex virus infections, including oral herpes in children. It is ineffective against CMV because it targets thymidine kinase, an enzyme in herpes simplex virus (HSV) and varicella-zoster virus (VZV), but it is absent in CMV. Valacyclovir and Famciclovir are also effective for managing HSV 1 and 2. Foscarnet is used in conditions that are resistant to the above antivirals. Valganciclovir (Option A) is a prodrug of Ganciclovir . It is mostly used to manage CMV, especially in the case of CMV retinitis. Ganciclovir (Option B) is the drug of choice to manage CMV and is also used to manage EBV; in case of resistance, Foscarnet can be used. Cidofovir (Option C) can be used to manage both CMV and HSV infections . It is effective against many acyclovir-resistant HSV and ganciclovir-resistant CMV cases. However, it is nephrotoxic , so it should be used under caution.

      "correct_answer": "D",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: D) HHV-6 causes the above condition, and HHV-7 is not related to it. Explanation: The child's sudden high fever, followed by a rose-coloured maculopapular rash, indicates roseola infantum, primarily caused by human herpesvirus 6 (HHV-6). While HHV-6 causes the condition, HHV-7 is related and can cause similar illnesses. HHV-6 shows some antigenic cross-reactivity with HHV-7, and both bind to T-cells via CD46 (Options A and C). HHV-6 has 2 variants, i.e. A and B. Both HHV 6 & 7 spreads through saliva. Conditions caused HHV 6 In children : Sixth disease/ Roseola/ Exanthem Subitum (sudden high fever followed by a distinctive rash) In adults : Infectious mononucleosis-like symptoms and focal encephalitis (Option B) In Immunodeficient - Pneumonia and Disseminated disease.

      "explanation": "Correct Answer: D) HHV 8 does not spread through oral secretions Explanation: HHV-8 is found in oral secretions and can spread through saliva (the most common route of transmission) . This can also be transmitted through Sexual contact Vertical transmission Blood transfusion Organ transplants HHV 8 Investigations PCR Serological tests : Indirect immunofluorescence, Western blot and ELISA. Clinical conditions Kaposi sarcoma: (Option B) Commonly affected sites are lower limbs, followed by lymph nodes. It commonly affects the immunocompromised people. Primary effusion lymphoma (Option A) Castleman's disease: (Option C) It is a rare lymphoproliferative disorder characterised by the abnormal growth of lymphoid tissue. Lollipop follicles are a distinctive histological feature seen in lymphoid tissue in this condition.
