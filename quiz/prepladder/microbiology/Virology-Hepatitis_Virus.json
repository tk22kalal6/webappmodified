      "correct_answer": "D",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: D) HEV PCR for viral RNA Explanation: The symptoms of the patient correlate with the diagnosis of hepatitis E, which can definitively be detected using a polymerase chain reaction to detect the genome (RNA) of the virus. Hepatitis E Virus (HEV) Epidemiology : Hepatitis E virus is a zoonotic pathogen that can infect several animals, including monkeys, cats, pigs, and dogs. Most non-A, non-B ( NANB ) hepatitis cases are transmitted through fecal contamination of drinking water (referred to as enterically transmitted NANB or E-NANB ). Epidemics are common and hence are also called epidemic NANB. In India, HEV infection is responsible for the majority of sporadic acute hepatitis cases and epidemic hepatitis , accounting for 30-60% of occurrences. Young adults aged 20 to 40 are more commonly affected by HEV infection than children are by HAV infection. Transmission: Infection sources include fecally contaminated water and the environment. The secondary attack rate (transmission from infected persons to their close contacts) among household contacts is low (2-3%), compared to 10-20% for hepatitis A. Morphology : HEV is a spherical , non-enveloped virus measuring 32-34 nm in diameter and featuring a single-stranded RNA genome . The virion surface has indentations and spikes , and the virus is labile . It has a specific antigen, HEV-Ag. It is morphologically similar to Caliciviruses, such as the Norwalk virus, which is classified provisionally in the Hepeviridae family. Clinical features: Incubation period : Ranges from 2 to 9 weeks , averaging around six weeks. Affected population : Primarily young to middle - aged adults (ages 15-40). Severity : Generally mild and self - limited , with a low case fatality rate of about 1%. Pregnant women : Higher risk, with a 20-40% case fatality rate in the last trimester . Fulminant hepatitis can occur at a significantly higher risk, with a rate of around 20%. There is no chronic infection or carrier state associated with this condition. Laboratory diagnosis: HEV RNA can be identified in stool and serum using reverse transcriptase PCR , even before clinical symptoms appear. Serum Antibody Detection by ELISA : IgM anti-HEV : Appears in serum simultaneously with elevated liver enzyme levels, indicating an acute infection. IgG anti-HEV : Replaces IgM within 2 to 4 weeks after symptoms resolve and can persist for years, indicating recovery or a past infection. ELISA kits are available for detecting IgG and IgM antibodies using recombinant and synthetic peptide antigens. These have a high rate of false negatives and positives and hence cannot be used as a definitive method. (Options A & B) HEV virions can be detected through immuno-electron microscopy (IEM) of bile, serum, and",

      "correct_answer": "D",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: D) Dane particles Explanation: Dane particles are the complete virions of the Hepatitis B virus, measuring approximately 42 nm. Dane particles contain the viral genome and are essential for establishing infection. They consist of a double-shelled structure that includes both surface antigens (Small HbsAg and Medium HbsAg) and are capable of transmitting Hepatitis B from one individual to another, leading to infection. Hepatitis B virus (HBV) Characteristics Family: Hepadnaviridae Infectivity: Highly infectious; HBV is 50-100 times more infectious than HIV. Impact: Can result in both acute and chronic liver disease, potentially leading to cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).

      },
      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: C) C gene Explanation: High levels of HBV replication are associated with the presence of HBeAg, which is derived from the pre-core region of the C gene. The presence of HBeAg in the serum indicates active viral replication and correlates with higher levels of viral DNA, making it a significant marker of infectivity. Replication Process of Hepatitis B Virus replication process\" data-author=\"\" data-hash=\"11603\" data-license=\"\" data-source=\"\" data-tags=\"May2025\" src=\"https://image.prepladder.com/notes/5hmsDTy9YwOqjUFnfqiE1746265728.png\" /> Attachment and Entry: HBV attaches to hepatocytes using the sodium taurocholate co-transporting polypeptide (NTCP) receptor. The virus enters the cell via endocytosis. ↓ Uncoating and Nuclear Transport: Post-entry, the viral capsid is transported to the nucleus. The relaxed circular, partially double-stranded DNA (rcDNA) is released and repaired by host enzymes to form covalently closed circular DNA (cccDNA), which serves as the transcription template. ↓ Transcription and Translation: cccDNA is transcribed by host RNA polymerase II, producing viral RNAs, including pregenomic RNA (pgRNA) and subgenomic RNAs encoding HBV proteins (surface antigen, core protein, polymerase, and X protein). Genome Genes Gene Product Function/Description S (Surface) (Option A) Surface Antigen (HBsAg) Encodes the surface antigen, essential for viral entry and immune response induction. It is commonly detected as a marker in serological testing. C (Core) Core Antigen (HBcAg) Forms the viral nucleocapsid and plays a role in genome packaging and immune evasion. HBeAg Secretory form of the core antigen, aids in immune tolerance, and is associated with viral replication and infectivity levels. P (Polymerase) (Option D) Viral Polymerase Functions in reverse transcription, crucial for converting RNA intermediate back to DNA for viral replication. X (Option B) Regulatory Protein (HBx) Involved in viral replication regulation; may play a role in oncogenesis by affecting cell growth and survival pathways. These RNAs move to the cytoplasm for translation, resulting in viral protein production. ↓ Reverse Transcription: pgRNA is encapsidated within new capsids. Within the capsid, HBV polymerase reverse transcribes pgRNA into partially double-stranded DNA, a unique feature for HBV. ↓ Assembly and Release: DNA-containing capsids are enveloped with surface antigens and exit the cell via exocytosis or direct virion release. Some capsids return to the nucleus to maintain cccDNA, enabling chronic infection. Mode of Transmission Highly Infectious, easily spreads through bodily fluids. Blood Contact: Direct blood contact transmits HBV. Sexual Contact: Unprotected sex is a key transmission route. Perinatal: Mother-to-child transmission during birth. Needle Sharing: High risk via shared needles (IV drug use). Occupational Exposure: Healthcare workers at risk from bodily fluids. Other Fluids: Also transmits through saliva and semen.

      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: B) Chronic hepatitis B infection Explanation: The liver biopsy shows hepatocytes with a \"ground-glass\" appearance. This appearance is specifically associated with chronic hepatitis B due to the accumulation of viral proteins in the endoplasmic reticulum of hepatocytes. This finding is a key histopathological feature indicative of chronic hepatitis B infection. Acute hepatitis Acinar inflammation ( may include or exclude portal inflammation ). Ballooning degeneration of hepatocytes Apoptotic bodies , also known as acidophil or Councilman bodies , are large cell fragments or intact apoptotic cells found free in the sinusoids. Kupffer cell hypertrophy. Hepatocyte dropout and focal or spotty necrosis. Severe cases may show zonal or panacinar necrosis. Chronic hepatitis Inflammation and Injury : Portal lymphocytic or lymphoplasmacytic inflammation, often breaching the limiting plate and causing periportal hepatocyte injury (interface activity), with variable lobular inflammation. Fibrosis and Progression : Begins as portal and periportal fibrosis, advancing to fibrous septa formation with porto-portal bridging fibrosis, and potentially progressing to cirrhosis. Chronic Hepatitis B : (Option B) Hepatocytes show a \"ground-glass\" appearance due to HBsAg accumulation in the swollen endoplasmic reticulum . Shikata Orcein Antigen Stain used for HBsAg Chronic Hepatitis C : (Option D) Portal tracts contain prominent lymphoid aggregates or fully formed lymphoid follicles. Steatosis is common, especially with genotype 3. Focal bile duct injury may occur, occasionally resembling biliary disease.

      "explanation": "Correct Answer: B) IgG anti-viral Explanation: In the convalescent phase, IgG antibodies are produced as part of the immune response, indicating that the body has cleared the virus and is developing long-term immunity. Hepatitis A: Clinical Presentation and Investigation Clinical Presentation Hepatitis A is a viral infection caused by the Hepatitis A virus (HAV) and is primarily transmitted via the fecal-oral route, often through contaminated food or water. Incubation Period: 15 to 50 days (average 28 days). Symptoms: Prodromal Phase: Initial symptoms may include fatigue, malaise, low-grade fever, nausea, vomiting, and abdominal discomfort, typically lasting a few days. Mild Hepatitis: Progression may lead to jaundice, dark urine, and pale stools due to impaired bilirubin excretion. Icterus (Jaundice): Occurs in ~70% of patients. Hepatomegaly Other Symptoms: pruritus and arthralgia may occur. Recovery: Slow spontaneous recovery typically occurs within 1 to 2 months; complete resolution is common. Rare Complications: Cholestatic jaundice and fulminant hepatitis, which occurs in <0.1% of patients Investigations Serological Markers: IgM Anti-HAV: Indicates recent infection; detectable within the first week of illness and lasts for several months. IgG Anti-HAV: Indicates past infection or vaccination; provides lifelong immunity and is detectable for years. Detection of HAV particles: HAV appears in stool from –2 to +2 weeks of jaundice. It can also be detected in the liver, bile, and blood by immunoelectron microscopy. Liver Function Tests (LFTs): ALT and AST: Elevated Alkaline Phosphatase: May be mildly elevated, especially in cholestatic cases.

      "correct_answer": "D",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: D) It is recommended for individuals under one year of age. Explanation: The Hepatitis A vaccine is generally recommended for children starting at age 1 (12 months), not for those under one year of age. Hepatitis A Vaccine Type of Vaccine: Inactivated (killed) form Indications: Routine Vaccination for Children: Recommended for all children aged 1 year (typically between 12-23 months). High-Risk Groups: Travelers to regions with high rates of HAV infection. Individuals with chronic liver disease or clotting factor disorders. People who use injection or non-injection illicit drugs. Outbreak Control: Used to help control HAV outbreaks within communities. Two types of vaccines are available for human use: Formaldehyde-inactivated vaccine : It is given to children after 12 months of age. Single dose is administered by intramuscular route (deltoid) followed by a booster at 6–12 months gap. Its protective efficacy is about 94% Live attenuated vaccine: It is given as a single dose, subcutaneously . Age for Vaccination Children: The recommended starting age is 1 year (12-23 months). Immunogenicity and Efficacy Effectiveness: Provides 95% protection after the first dose. Near-complete protection is achieved after the second dose. Duration of Immunity: Offers long-lasting immunity, with many individuals maintaining protective antibody levels for decades post-vaccination. Post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP) For Unvaccinated Individuals Exposed to HAV: Within 2 weeks of exposure: A single dose of the Hepatitis A vaccine or immunoglobulin (IG) is recommended. Preference for IG: Immunoglobulin may be preferred for infants (<12 months), older adults, and individuals with weakened immune systems.

      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: B) Precore mutants Explanation: Precore mutants abolish HBeAg production and are often associated with more severe chronic hepatitis, leading to rapid progression to cirrhosis. Although the virus continues to replicate, it fails to produce functional HBeAg in this condition. Hepatitis B Virus Mutants: Precore Mutants: (Option B) Mutation occurs in the precore region (abolishes HBeAg production) or the basal core promoter region (downregulates HBeAg production). Often diagnosed late in infected patients. Associated with more severe chronic hepatitis that progresses rapidly to cirrhosis. Patients do not produce HBeAg, although other HBV markers are present. Escape Mutants: (Option A) Mutation occurs in the common \"a\" determinant in the S gene of HBsAg, which prevents neutralization by anti-HBsAg antibodies. Situations where escape mutants are observed: Infants born to HBeAg-positive mothers. Liver transplant recipients who received combined immunization with anti-HBV immunoglobulin and vaccine. Clinical Implication: If escape mutants become more prevalent, they may pose challenges for hepatitis B prophylaxis. YMDD Mutation : (Option C) Occurs in the YMDD locus within the HBV reverse transcriptase region of the polymerase gene. Clinical Implication: HBV-infected patients on lamivudine therapy may develop resistance due to this mutation . Antigenic shift (Option D): This specifically refers to significant changes in influenza A virus antigens, not applicable to Hepatitis B and HBeAg production.

      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: C) HBIG and hepatitis B vaccine; 70–90% risk Explanation: In newborns of HBeAg-positive mothers , the perinatal transmission risk is 70–90%. Immediate administration of HBIG and the hepatitis B vaccine series is recommended to reduce this risk. Prevention of Perinatal Transmission: Babies Born to Carrier Mothers: 0.5 ml of HBIG was given IM immediately after birth. Followed by the full vaccine course at a different anatomical site, starting within 12 hours of birth. 95% of infected newborns become chronic carriers. Breastfeeding is not contraindicated. Antigen in Mothers Risk of Perinatal Transmission HBeAg-positive 70–90% (Option C) HBeAg-negative/HBeAb-negative 25% (Option A) HBeAg-negative/anti-HBe-positive 12% (Option B) Hepatitis B Vaccine: Recombinant subunit vaccine. Prepared in baker’s yeast via DNA recombinant technology by cloning the S gene. Route of Administration: Intramuscular injection in the deltoid region (anterolateral thigh for infants). Dosage: 10–20 µg per dose (Half dose for children under 10 years). Schedule: For Adults: Three doses at 0, 1, and 6 months. National Immunization Schedule: Given at 6, 10, and 14 weeks along with the DPT vaccine. Minimum interval between doses: 4 weeks. Marker of Protection: Seroconversion with anti-HBsAg antibody titer ≥ 10 mIU/mL. Revaccination: For healthcare workers with anti-HBs titer <10 mIU/mL after the first vaccine series, a second series (3 doses at 0, 1, and 6 months) is given. HBIG and hepatitis B vaccine; 10–20% risk (Option D): While HBIG and the hepatitis B vaccine series are recommended, the transmission risk for newborns of HBeAg-positive mothers is actually much higher, at 70–90%, not 10–20%.

      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: C) HBIG and start HBV vaccine series Explanation: For individuals with a history of inadequate vaccine response (anti-HBs titer of <10 IU/mL) , the recommended treatment is to administer HBIG and start a complete 3-dose vaccine series or a second dose of HBIG after one month. Post-Exposure Prophylaxis: Healthcare Worker Status Source HBsAg Positive HBsAg Negative Status not known Unvaccinated HBIG + 3 doses of HBV vaccine series 3 doses of HBV vaccine series Previously vaccinated with complete HBV series; with protective titre (anti-HBs titer is >10 IU/m) No treatment Previously vaccinated with complete HBV series; unprotective titre (anti-HBs titer is <10 IU/m) HBIG + 3 doses of HBV vaccine series HBV Vaccine: second series with 3 doses HBIG + 3 doses of HBV vaccine series/administer second dose of HBIG 1 month later Previously vaccinated with complete HBV series; unknown antibody responds Check titre if <10 mIU/mL: HBIG + Complete 3 dose vaccine series >10 mIU/mL: No treatment No treatment Check titre if <10 mIU/mL: HBIG + Complete 3 dose vaccine series >10 mIU/mL: No treatment Undergoing vaccination at time of exposure HBIG + Complete 3 dose vaccine series Complete 3 dose vaccine series Nonresponders (exposed person who is vaccinated for 2 series i.e, 6 doses and has unprotective titre) Administer HBIG, 2 doses, 1 month apart No treatment HBIG only (Option A): This option is inadequate as it does not provide the necessary vaccination to prevent infection. HBV vaccine series only (Option B): This option is not sufficient without the addition of HBIG, especially given the exposure to an HBsAg-positive patient. No treatment needed (Option D): This option is unsafe and does not address the risk of infection after exposure to a known source of hepatitis B.

      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: B) Superinfection Explanation: The presence of IgG anti-HBc and mixed IgM and IgG anti-HDV indicates that the patient is experiencing a superinfection with HDV on top of a chronic HBV infection. Hepatitis D: Characteristics of Hepatitis D Virus (HDV): Small (35 nm) with circular, negative-sense ssRNA. Protein coat composed of hepatitis D antigen (HDAg). Enveloped with hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) from HBV, hence called defective virus Dependent on HBV for replication and expression; cannot exist independently. Types of Infection: Co-infection: (Option A) HDV and HBV are transmitted together. HBV infection occurs first, allowing HBsAg to support HDV. Presents as acute hepatitis B, with symptoms from mild to fulminant. Usually self-limited; rarely progresses to chronic stage (1-10%). Superinfection: (Option B) HDV infects a chronic HBV carrier, often leading to severe chronic illness No link with hepatocellular carcinoma. M/c cause of fulminant hepatitis: HDV superinfection Diagnosis: Co-infection: IgM anti-HBc + IgM anti-HDV IgM anti-HDV appears late and is short-lived. Superinfection: IgG anti-HBc + mixed IgM and IgG anti-HDV HBeAg indicating active HBV replication may be present. Acute hepatitis D (Option C): While the patient shows worsening symptoms, the presence of IgG anti-HBc suggests that this is not an acute infection but rather a superinfection on top of a chronic HBV infection. Chronic hepatitis D (Option D): This is inaccurate as the presence of mixed IgM and IgG anti-HDV signifies a superinfection with HDV, which typically leads to more severe liver disease rather than chronic infection.",

        "D": "Fibroscan"
      },
      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: C) RT-PCR for HCV RNA Explanation: RT-PCR for HCV RNA is the gold standard for confirming active HCV infection. While an ELISA test detects antibodies, it does not differentiate between past and active infections. The presence of HCV RNA indicates ongoing viral replication and active infection. The core antigen assay, though helpful for initial diagnosis and monitoring, is less sensitive than RT-PCR. Hepatitis C Virus (HCV) Classification HCV belongs to the Flaviviridae family, genus Hepacivirus. Structure and Genome Spherical, 60 nm, enveloped virus with a positive-sense single-stranded RNA (ssRNA). Structural proteins : Core protein (C), envelope glycoproteins (E1, E2). Nonstructural proteins : NS2, NS3, NS4A, NS4B, NS5A, NS5B. P7 membrane protein (NS1) functions as an ion channel. Transmission Primarily bloodborne : Transfusions, organ transplants, needle-sharing. Vertical transmission (~6%) & rarely sexual transmission. Not spread by breast milk, food, or casual contact. Clinical Manifestation Incubation : 15–160 days (average 50 days). Asymptomatic in over 75% of cases. Acute hepatitis in ~20%: usually mild or anicteric Chronic Progression Chronic Disease: 75–85% of cases progress to chronic disease. Chronic Hepatitis: 60–70% of chronic cases. Cirrhosis: 5–20% of cases with chronic infection. Hepatocellular Carcinoma (HCC): 1–5% of cases; HCV accounts for ~25% of liver cancers. Extrahepatic Manifestations Immune complex deposition can cause: Mixed cryoglobulinemia Glomerulonephritis Arthritis and joint pain. Laboratory Diagnosis Antibody Detection Tests: ELISA is standard for initial screening with high sensitivity and specificity. Cannot differentiate active vs. past infections. HCV Core Antigen Assay: Automated, cost-effective for active infection diagnosis and treatment monitoring. Less sensitive than RT-PCR. (Option A) Molecular Methods (RT-PCR): Gold standard for confirming active infection; detects HCV RNA 2–3 weeks post-infection, used for viral load, treatment response, and genotype. (Option C) Biopsy (Option B) is the gold standard for staging ; Fibroscan (Option D) is a non-invasive alternative for assessing liver fibrosis. Treatment Goals: Prevent complications (e.g., cirrhosis, liver cancer) and achieve sustained viral response (SVR). Sofosbuvir/velpatasvir is effective against all genotypes. Duration: Typically 12–24 weeks, depending on genotype and liver status.",
