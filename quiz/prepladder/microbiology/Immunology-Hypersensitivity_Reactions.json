      "explanation": "Correct Answer: D) Type IV Explanation: Duration of the types of hypersensitivity reactions: Type I (Immediate): Occurs within 2–30 minutes due to IgE-mediated release of histamine. Type II (Cytotoxic): Can occur within 5–8 hours; mediated by antibody binding to cell antigens, but does not fit the delayed category. Type III (Immune Complex): Symptoms can develop 2–8 hours later but are generally not as delayed as Type IV. Type IV (Delayed): Characterized by delayed hypersensitivity, mediated by T lymphocytes, with symptoms appearing 24 to 72 hours after antigen exposure, as seen in tuberculosis skin tests.

      "question": "A 28-year-old woman with a history of asthma experiences severe wheezing, shortness of breath, and facial swelling minutes after accidentally ingesting peanuts. She is treated promptly in the emergency department with epinephrine, antihistamines, and corticosteroids, and her symptoms improve. However, 8 hours later, she began to develop increased chest tightness and wheezing, requiring additional medical intervention. Which of the following best explains her delayed respiratory symptoms?",

        "D": "Development of IgG antibodies against the allergen, causing a delayed hypersensitivity reaction"
      },
      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "inflammatory response Correct Answer: C) Recruitment of eosinophils and other inflammatory cells, causing a delayed inflammatory response Explanation : In the late phase of a Type I hypersensitivity reaction, inflammatory cells like eosinophils are recruited to the site, releasing additional mediators that lead to a delayed inflammatory response, which explains the patient’s recurrent symptoms hours after the initial reaction. Phases of type I hypersensitivity reaction: 1. Early Phase: Occurs within 2 hours. Mediators: Performed : Histamine, Tryptase Newly formed : Prostaglandins, Leukotrienes, Platelet Activating Factor (PAF). Effects : Histamine causes vasodilation (blood vessels) and bronchoconstriction (lungs). Other mediators lead to bronchoconstriction. 2. Late Phase (Delayed Reaction) Onset : Begins 4–12 hours after the initial reaction, peaks at 24–48 hours, and can last for several days. Mechanism : Cytokine and Chemokine Release : Mast cells and basophils release cytokines (e.g., IL-4, IL-5, IL-13) and chemokines that attract and activate other inflammatory cells, particularly eosinophils , neutrophils , and T-helper cells (Th2) . Infiltration of Inflammatory Cells : These cells migrate to the site of allergen exposure and release additional mediators like leukotrienes , prostaglandins , and proteases . Sustained Inflammation : The continued release of these mediators maintains the inflammatory response, causing tissue damage and prolonged symptoms. Incomplete clearance of histamine from the bloodstream (Option A), is incorrect because histamine , released in the early phase , is typically cleared from the system within minutes to hours, and delayed symptoms are not due to prolonged histamine activity alone. Continuous allergen exposure leading to sustained mast cell degranulation (Option B), is incorrect, as the patient’s symptoms are not due to continuous allergen exposure but rather to the late-phase inflammatory response triggered by cytokines and chemokines . Developing IgG antibodies against the allergen, causing a delayed hypersensitivity reaction (Option D), is incorrect because IgG antibodies are not primarily involved in Type I hypersensitivity. The patient’s reaction is mediated by IgE and mast cells in the early phase, with eosinophil involvement in the late phase.",

      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: A) Type I Hypersensitivity (Early) Explanation: Type I Hypersensitivity (Early ), is an immediate reaction triggered by IgE-mediated mast cell degranulation, causing symptoms like hives, swelling, and respiratory distress within minutes of allergen exposure. Other options describe features inconsistent with her presentation and typical of delayed hypersensitivity types (I (Delayed), III, and IV), which have different mechanisms and symptom timelines. Type I hypersensitivity reaction phases and their features: Phase Timing Mechanism Clinical Features Early Phase Seconds to minutes Mast cell/basophil degranulation : IgE cross-linking leads to the release of histamine and other mediators. Skin : Urticaria (hives), itching (pruritus), erythema (redness), localized angioedema (swelling around lips, eyes) Respiratory : Bronchoconstriction leading to wheezing, shortness of breath, chest tightness, sneezing, nasal congestion (allergic rhinitis) Cardiovascular : Vasodilation and hypotension (drop in blood pressure), dizziness, syncope (fainting) Gastrointestinal : Nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, diarrhea due to smooth muscle contraction Systemic Reaction : Anaphylaxis in severe cases, with generalized urticaria, angioedema, severe hypotension, and respiratory distress (life-threatening) Late Phase 4–12 hours, peaks at 24–48 hours, lasting up to days Inflammatory cell recruitment : Cytokines/chemokines attract eosinophils, neutrophils, and macrophages, causing sustained inflammation. Skin : Persistent redness, swelling, intense itching, and development of an eczema-like rash (seen in atopic dermatitis) Respiratory : Recurrent bronchoconstriction, prolonged wheezing, coughing, chest tightness, mucus production, and airway hyperresponsiveness (chronic asthma exacerbation) Eyes : Persistent redness and irritation in conjunctiva (allergic conjunctivitis) Chronic Changes : In prolonged or recurrent reactions, there may be tissue remodeling, fibrosis, and thickening of affected areas (e.g., airways in asthma, skin in chronic dermatitis) Types of hypersensitivity reactions and their features: Type Mechanism Clinical Features Onset Type I Early IgE-mediated mast cell degranulation Hives, swelling, respiratory distress Immediate (minutes) Type I Delayed IgE-mediated mast cell degranulation Wheezing, chest tightness, localized itching (Option B ruled out) Hours to days Type II Antibody-mediated cell destruction Hemolytic anemia, thrombocytopenia Delayed (hours to days) Type III Immune complex deposition Joint pain, fever, vasculitis (Option C ruled out) Delayed (hours to days) Type IV T-cell mediated response Skin rash, contact dermatitis (Option D ruled out) Delayed (48-72 hours) Hypersensitivity reactions\" data-author=\"OpenStax College\" data-hash=\"10115\" data-license=\"CC BY 3.0\" data-source=\"https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:2228_Immune_Hypersensitivity_new.jpg\" data-tags=\"April2025\" height=\"374\" src=\"https://image.prepladder.com/notes/MFQcnPun5TRULhusspjU1744470832.png\" width=\"483\" />",

        "C": "Atopic dermatitis followed by urticaria",
        "D": "Allergic rhinitis followed by food allergy"
      },
      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: A) Anaphylaxis followed by allergic asthma Explanation : The child's immediate symptoms—facial swelling, hives, and difficulty breathing—are classic signs of anaphylaxis , a severe and potentially life-threatening Type I hypersensitivity reaction triggered by the peanuts. His subsequent wheezing and chest tightness later that night indicate the development of allergic asthma , a common late-phase reaction that can occur after an initial allergic response. Clinical Examples of Type I Hypersensitivity Reactions: Condition Trigger Early Phase Symptoms Late Phase Symptoms Anaphylaxis Foods (e.g., peanuts, shellfish), insect stings, medications (e.g., penicillin) Sudden onset of hives, facial swelling, difficulty breathing, low blood pressure, rapid progression to shock Persistent wheezing, chest tightness, difficulty breathing, sustained low blood pressure; can last hours after initial exposure Allergic Rhinitis (Hay Fever) Pollen, dust mites, pet dander Sneezing, itchy and watery eyes, runny nose, nasal congestion Prolonged nasal congestion, sinus pressure, and coughing due to postnasal drip Allergic Asthma Pollen, mold, animal dander, air pollutants Coughing, wheezing, chest tightness, shortness of breath Persistent wheezing, chest tightness, and airway hyperresponsiveness lead to chronic symptoms if untreated Food Allergy Common allergens include peanuts, tree nuts, eggs, milk, seafood Hives, itching, swelling of lips/face, nausea, abdominal pain, vomiting, and, in severe cases, anaphylaxis Persistent abdominal pain, diarrhea, skin rash (eczema) in some chronic cases, worsening of asthma or other respiratory symptoms Atopic Dermatitis (Eczema) Environmental allergens, certain foods, skin irritants Red, itchy rash, often in flexural areas (e.g., inside elbows, behind knees) Chronic dry, thickened skin due to scratching, possible development of secondary infections due to skin barrier breakdown Urticaria (Hives) Foods, medications, insect stings, temperature changes Raised, red, itchy welts (hives) on the skin, can appear within minutes of exposure If chronic, repeated episodes of itching and welts lasting hours to days after initial exposure Urticaria followed by allergic rhinitis (Option B), is incorrect because while urticaria (hives) can appear in allergic reactions, it does not typically cause significant breathing issues, and allergic rhinitis primarily involves nasal symptoms like sneezing and congestion. Atopic dermatitis followed by urticaria (Option C), is incorrect because atopic dermatitis (eczema) is a chronic skin condition and does not directly lead to the acute symptoms seen in this case. Allergic rhinitis followed by food allergy (Option D), is incorrect because allergic rhinitis is not a match for the child's initial acute symptoms, and food allergy alone wouldn’t explain the subsequent wheezing.

      "explanation": "Correct Answer: B) Antibody binding to cell surface antigens with complement activation hypersensitivity reaction . Here, IgG or IgM antibodies target cell surfaces, activating the complement system and leading to inflammation and cell destruction. Mechanism of Type-2 Hypersensitivity reaction: Hypersensitivity reaction-01\" data-author=\"\" data-hash=\"10116\" data-license=\"\" data-source=\"\" data-tags=\"April2025\" src=\"https://image.prepladder.com/notes/NmnlIaMvEjEeRI6mzx0q1744470996.png\" /> 1. Antibody-Antigen Interaction In Type II HS reactions, IgG or IgM antibodies are produced in response to specific antigens on the surfaces of target cells (such as red blood cells or tissues). These antigens can be: Intrinsic : Naturally present on the cell, like blood group antigens in hemolytic reactions. Extrinsic : Foreign antigens that have attached to cell surfaces, often from medications or infections. 2. Activation of Complement Cascade When antibodies bind to these cell surface antigens, they form antibody-antigen complexes. This binding activates the complement system (a group of proteins in the blood that assist immune responses). The complement pathway progresses through a series of steps, ultimately forming the Membrane Attack Complex (MAC) , which punctures the cell membrane, leading to direct cell lysis (rupture). 3. Opsonization and Phagocytosis Complement activation also enhances opsonization —the process of marking cells with \"tags\" (complement components and antibodies) to attract phagocytes. Phagocytes (like macrophages and neutrophils) recognize these \"tags,\" engulf them and digest the targeted cells. 4. Antibody-Dependent Cellular Cytotoxicity (ADCC) Natural Killer (NK) cells bind to the Fc region of IgG antibodies attached to the target cell, releasing cytotoxic substances that further contribute to cell death Type 5 Hypersensitivity (ADCC) involves antibodies binding to cell surface receptors , leading to altered cell function rather than direct cell destruction. Graves' Disease : Autoantibodies stimulate the TSH receptor on thyroid cells, causing excess thyroid hormone production (hyperthyroidism). Myasthenia Gravis : Autoantibodies block acetylcholine receptors at the neuromuscular junction, leading to muscle weakness . 5. Tissue Damage and Inflammation: The localized immune response and subsequent cell destruction lead to tissue damage, inflammation, and the clinical symptoms associated with Type II HS reactions. Antigen-specific IgE binding to mast cells (Option A), is incorrect as this describes a Type I hypersensitivity reaction (like allergies), where IgE antibodies bind to allergens and cause mast cell degranulation, releasing histamine and leading to symptoms like hives and bronchoconstriction. Immune complexes depositing in blood vessels (Option C), is incorrect as this",

      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: C) Autoimmune Hemolytic Anemia (AIHA): Type 2 Hypersensitivity Explanation: In AIHA, antibodies (IgG or IgM ) target red blood cell antigens, leading to RBC destruction via complement activation or phagocytosis, typical of Type II hypersensitivity reactions. The direct Coombs test is positive in AIHA, indicating antibodies attached to RBCs, consistent with Type II hypersensitivity, which is an antibody-mediated reaction against cell surface antigens. Type II hypersensitivity reactions, also known as cytotoxic hypersensitivity , occur when antibodies (primarily IgG or IgM) bind to antigens on the surface of cells or tissues. This binding activates the complement system or mediates cellular destruction via phagocytosis and cellular cytotoxicity, leading to tissue damage and inflammation. The damage is specific to the target cell or tissue expressing the antigen. Examples of Type 2 Hypersensitivity reactions: Myasthenia Gravis Graves Disease Good pastures syndrome Autoimmune hemolytic anemia Autoimmune Hemolytic Anemia (AIHA): Type 1 Hypersensitivity (Option A ) AIHA does not involve Type I hypersensitivity, which is IgE-mediated and usually linked to allergies.

      "explanation": "Correct Answer: B) Post-streptococcal glomerulonephritis Explanation: The patient’s symptoms and laboratory findings suggest post-streptococcal glomerulonephritis (PSGN) , a Type III hypersensitivity reaction. In PSGN, immune complexes formed in response to streptococcal antigens deposit in the glomeruli of the kidneys, leading to complement activation, inflammation, and tissue damage. Type III hypersensitivity reactions, also known as immune complex-mediated hypersensitivity , involve the formation of immune complexes (antigen-antibody complexes) that circulate in the bloodstream. Examples of Type 3 HS reactions include: Serum Sickness: occurs after exposure to foreign serum proteins, with immune complexes causing fever, rash, and joint pain. SLE: immune complexes deposit in various organs, causing multi-organ inflammation. Henoch Schonelien Purpura: deposition of IgA immune complexes in blood vessels Arthus reaction: localized reaction from immune complex deposition at the injection site, causing swelling and redness. PSGN: immune complexes from streptococcal infection deposit in the kidneys.

      "explanation": "Correct Answer: D) Activation of sensitized T cells Explanation: The patient’s presentation is consistent with allergic contact dermatitis due to latex exposure, a classic Type IV hypersensitivity reaction . In this delayed-type hypersensitivity, T cells are sensitized to an antigen (latex in this case). Upon re-exposure, these T cells release cytokines, which attract macrophages and other immune cells, leading to inflammation and skin changes. Type IV hypersensitivity is characterized by a T cell-mediated immune response that results in delayed inflammation and tissue damage upon re-exposure to an antigen. Unlike other types of hypersensitivity that involve antibodies, Type IV is purely cell-mediated and plays a crucial role in both protective immunity and autoimmune diseases. The key players in this response are T cells, macrophages, and cytokines, which work together to produce inflammation and tissue injury. Seen in contact dermatitis and tuberculin reactions. Activation of IgE antibodies bound to mast cells (Option A) describes the mechanism of Type I hypersensitivity, involving IgE and mast cells.

Multiple Sclerosis - T-cell attack on myelin in the central nervous system. Rheumatoid arthritis - T-cell-mediated attack on joint tissues. Tuberculin skin test (Mantoux test) – reaction to injected tuberculin antigen in previously sensitized individuals. Hashimoto’s thyroiditis – T-cell-mediated destruction of thyroid cells.
