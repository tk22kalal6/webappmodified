      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer : C) Hot air oven and glassware Explanation: The device in the given image is that of a hot air oven and it can be used to sterilise glassware . Hot air oven is a sterilisation method that works on the principle of dry heat . Dry heat causes its killing effect by protein denaturation , damage by oxidising molecules , destroying cell constituents and toxic effects of elevated levels of electrolytes. The items to be sterilised are kept inside the oven for 2 hours and a holding period of 160 o C . Sterilisation is achieved through direct conduction of heat to the items kept inside the oven. Items that can be sterilised are mainly glassware , metallic instruments ( both sharps and non sharps ), some heat-resistant oils and waxes that are immiscible in water such as dusting powder and liquid paraffin . Hot air oven Hot air oven and culture media (Option A) : The given image is that of a hot air oven but culture media in general cannot be sterilised by hot air oven . They are sterilised by autoclave (moist heat) and some culture media that contain egg like LJ media and serum like Loeffler’s serum slope are sterilised by inspissation .

      "question": "During a community health meeting, a health inspector discusses the importance of preventing consumption of raw milk from cattle. What is the false statement regarding the treatment process of raw milk before consumption?",
      "options": {
        "A": "It is a type of disinfection method that uses moist heat.",
        "B": "Holder method is used to disinfect milk from Coxiella burnetii.",
        "C": "Presence of the enzyme phosphatase in the milk post-treatment suggests inadequate efficacy.",
        "D": "It helps to extend the shelf life of milk."
      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Correct answer: B) Holder method is used to disinfect milk from Coxiella burnetii. Explanation: The treatment process of raw milk discussed is pasteurisation and the method used to disinfect milk from Coxiella burnetii is Flash method and not Holder method. Pasteurisation is a moist heat based disinfection method used to destroy food spoiling organisms in milk, thereby extending their shelf-life. It was found and described by Louis Pasteur . ( Options A and D ruled out ) There are three methods of pasteurisation: Holder’s method - Milk is heated at 63 o C for 30 minutes . It can kill all non-sporing pathogens such as Mycobacteria , Brucella and Salmonella . But Coxiella burnetti are more heat-resistant and hence not killed . Flash method - Milk is heated at 72 o C for 15-20 seconds followed by quickly cooling to 13 o C or lower . It can kill Coxiella species as well as organisms killed by Holder's method. Ultra-high-temperature method(UHT) - Here milk is heated at 149 o C for 1-2 seconds . Used as a quick method for large scale disinfection. Presence of the enzyme phosphatase in the milk post-treatment suggests inadequate efficacy (Option C): Phosphatase test is used to test the efficacy of pasteurisation as the process of pasteurisation destroys the enzyme phosphatase present in milk. If present after the process, then it indicates contamination or inadequate pasteurisation . Coliform test is another test used to check for efficacy of pasteurisation. Reference: .

        "B": "Incineration",
        "C": "Tyndallization",
        "D": "Pasteurization"
      },
      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: C) Tyndallization Explanation: Tyndallization is the sterilisation/disinfection technique that acts on the principle of moist heat at 100 o C.(BAT-boling at 100 is tyndallisation. Tyndallization is also called intermittent sterilisation . It involves exposure to moist heat at 100 o C for 20 minutes on three successive days . The first exposure kills all vegetative bacteria . Spores which survive the first heat treatment, are allowed to germinate in the favourable medium. Subsequent exposures kill the newly formed vegetative cells from the germinated spores . Mainly used for sterilising media containing sugars or gelatin like TCBS, XLD, DCA, Selenite F broth . And other culture media where traditional autoclaving may affect the composition. However, its limitations are that it may not effectively kill spores of certain anaerobic bacteria and thermophiles (heat-loving bacteria) may also survive. Inspissation (Option A): It is also a sterilisation technique using moist heat but at 80–85°C for 30 minutes on 3 successive days. It is used to sterilise egg containing and serum containing culture media such as Lowenstein–Jensen medium for Mycobacterium species and Loeffler’s serum slope for diphtheria respectively. Incineration (Option B): It is a sterilisation technique that uses dry heat at very high temperatures in the range of 870°C to 980°C. This is a safe method t o treat large solid infectious waste, particularly anatomical waste like amputated limbs, animal carcasses and chemical wastes such as expired medications and chemicals. It converts the material into ash, leaving about a tenth of the original volume . However, it is expensive and is generally used only by very large establishments. It is the safest method to ensure that no infective materials remain , including prions(infective proteins). Pasteurization (Option D) : It is an intermediate-level disinfection technique that uses moist heat at temperatures <100°C to prevent various milk-borne infections and increase the shelf life of milk and fruit juices.

      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: A) 121 o C for 15 minutes at 15 psi pressure. Explanation: The given image is of an autoclave machine. The temperature settings kept in the machine for sterilisation are 121 o C for 15 minutes at 15 psi pressure . An autoclave is a sterilisation technique that uses moist heat at a temperature > 100 o C. The autoclave (steam steriliser) works on the principle of steam production under pressure . When this steam meets a cooler surface, it condenses, transferring its heat to that surface. The process continues until the surface temperature matches that of the steam. The resulting condensed water provides moist heat, effectively killing microbes on the materials by protein denaturation . Its temperature settings are 121 o C for 15 minutes at 15 psi",

        "C": "Plastic syringe",
        "D": "Antibiotic solution"
      },
      "correct_answer": "D",
      "explanation": "Correct answer: D) Antibiotic solution Explanation: Out of all the options, antibiotic solutions can be sterilised only by membrane filters. Membrane filtration is considered as one of the sterilisation techniques although only filtration of microorganisms occurs and not killing . Filtration is of mainly two types - membrane filtration and depth filtration . Membrane filtration is widely used in healthcare mainly in the filtration of air and water . Air filtration Water filtration It is done by using high-efficiency particulate air (HEPA) filters designed to remove organisms larger than 0.3 µ m from isolation rooms, operating rooms , and biological safety cabinets (BSCs) . ULPA filters (Ultra-low particulate/penetration air) can remove from the air at least 99.9% of dust and any airborne particles with a size of 0.12 µ m or larger. Surgical (3-ply) masks and respirators are the simplest examples of filters being used for purification of air. They remove microorganisms based on their pore size. Used for bacteriological examination of water in hospital settings , especially dialysis water. Also used to remove bacteria from pharmaceutical fluids that are heat labile and cannot be purified by any other means e.g. sera , sugar, toxin , vaccine and antibiotic solutions . The sterilisation control of membrane filters are Brevundimonas diminuta and Serratia marcescens . Suture material (Option A): In general, all suture materials are sterilised by autoclave except catgut which is sterilised by ionising radiation .(cold sterilisation) Liquid paraffin (Option B) is sterilised by a hot air oven, not membrane filters. Plastic syringe (Option C): Ionizing radiation, such as gamma radiation, is used to sterilise plastic disposables such as plastic syringes, catheters, or gloves before use. Reference: 1.

(Options A, B and D are ruled out) Surface-active agents are substances that act on the phosphate group of cell membranes by reducing the surface tension . After entering the cell, protein denaturation occurs. They act on bacteria, but have no action on spores , tubercle bacilli and most viruses . They are widely used as wetting agents, detergents and emulsifiers. The common compounds are acetyl trimethyl ammonium bromide (Cetavlon or Cetrimide ) and benzalkonium chloride . These are most active at alkaline pH and acid inactivates them. Organic matter reduces their action and anionic surface-active agents, like ordinary soaps, render them inactive. Soaps prepared from saturated fatty acids (such as coconut oil) are more effective against Gram-negative bacilli, while those prepared from unsaturated fatty acids (oleic acid) have greater action against Gram-positive and the Neisseria group of organisms.",
