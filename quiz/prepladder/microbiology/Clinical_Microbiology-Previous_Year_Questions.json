      "question": "Which of the following methods can detect deoxynucleotide incorporation in DNA?",
      "options": {
        "A": "Flow cytometry",
        "B": "Pyrosequencing",
        "C": "FISH",
        "D": "RFLP analysis"
      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: B) Pyrosequencing Explanation: Pyrosequencing is a DNA sequencing method that detects nucleotide incorporation by measuring the release of pyrophosphate (PPi) during DNA synthesis. The incorporation of deoxynucleotides is detected in real-time, making it the correct answer. Pyrosequencing in Microbial Genomics Purpose : Identifies bacterial species & strains Detects mutations linked to antimicrobial resistance Mechanism : DNA synthesis-based sequencing (one base at a time) Single-stranded template DNA immobilized Sequential addition of dNTPs Unincorporated dNTPs degraded before next addition Chemiluminescence signals indicate base incorporation Signal pattern determines DNA sequence Applications : Identifies SNPs, point mutations, insertions, deletions Quantifies multiple gene copies in drug-resistant strains Flow cytometry (Option A): Flow cytometry is used to analyze the physical and chemical characteristics of cells, such as DNA content, surface markers, and apoptosis. It does not directly detect deoxynucleotide incorporation in DNA. FISH (Fluorescence In Situ Hybridization) (Option C): FISH is a cytogenetic technique used to detect specific DNA or RNA sequences in chromosomes or cells. It does not assess nucleotide incorporation but rather identifies target sequences using fluorescent probes. RFLP analysis (Option D): Restriction Fragment Length Polymorphism (RFLP) is a method used for genetic fingerprinting and mutation analysis. It relies on restriction enzyme digestion and gel electrophoresis but does not measure nucleotide incorporation.

      "explanation": "Correct Answer: A) a-2, b-3, c-1, d-4 Explanation: Syphilis: The incubation period of Treponema pallidum (syphilis) ranges from 10 to 90 days, with an average of 3 weeks. Chickenpox: Varicella-zoster virus has an incubation period of 10 to 21 days, with an average of 14-16 days. SARS-CoV-2: The incubation period for COVID-19 typically ranges from 2 to 14 days, with an average of 5-6 days. Hepatitis A: The incubation period of Hepatitis A virus (HAV) is 15-50 days, with an average of 28 days.
