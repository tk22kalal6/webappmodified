      "question": "A 35-year-old man from a rural area presents with fever, malaise, and bleeding gums. He reports recent exposure to rodent droppings in his home. Which virus is most likely responsible for his symptoms?",
      "options": {
        "A": "Astrovirus",
        "B": "Rotavirus",
        "C": "Lassa fever virus",
        "D": "Coronavirus"
      },
      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: C) Lassa fever virus Explanation: Lassa fever virus, part of the Arenaviridae family, is transmitted through rodent exposure and is known to cause hemorrhagic fever, fitting the scenario. Arenaviridae Family Organisms & Diseases : Includes Lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus, Lassa fever virus, and South American hemorrhagic fever viruses. It is known to cause severe hemorrhagic illness in humans. Structure : Spherical or pleomorphic, 50–300 nm in size, with a unique sandy appearance due to ribosome-like particles. Composed of single-stranded, negative-sense RNA in two circular segments; has a helical structure. Vector : Primarily infects rodents as their natural host. Reservoir : Rodents serve as the primary reservoir Transmission : Occurs rarely in humans, often through contact with rodent excretions or materials contaminated by infected rodents. Diagnosis : Diagnosed through clinical recognition of hemorrhagic illness symptoms and laboratory testing specific to the virus type like RT-PCR and ELISA Astrovirus (Option A) generally causes mild gastroenteritis, primarily in children, and does not lead to hemorrhagic symptoms. Rotavirus (Option B) is associated with gastroenteritis in children and does not present with hemorrhagic symptoms or rodent transmission. Coronavirus (Option D) mainly causes respiratory symptoms and is not typically linked to hemorrhagic fever or rodent transmission.

      "question": "A 2 y/o child presents with acute onset of watery diarrhoea, vomiting, and fever. Given the symptoms and risk of dehydration, stool analysis is conducted to identify the causative virus. What shape would likely be observed in the virus detected from this child’s stool sample?",
      "options": {
        "A": "Bullet-shaped",
        "B": "Brick-shaped",
        "C": "Wheel-shaped",
        "D": "Helical"
      },
      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: C) Wheel-shaped Explanation: The symptoms of watery diarrhoea, vomiting, and fever, especially in a young child, strongly suggest rotavirus infection , a leading cause of pediatric gastroenteritis. Rotavirus is distinctively wheel-shaped , making it the expected appearance in stool analysis for this clinical presentation. Rotavirus Leading cause of childhood diarrhoea; belongs to the Reoviridae family (the only family with double-stranded RNA) . Structure : Size: 60–80 nm, icosahedral symmetry with a triple-layered, wheel-shaped capsid. Genome: Segmented dsRNA (11 segments). Proteins : Structural (VP1–VP7, except VP5); VP6 is group-specific. VP7 (outer capsid) and VP4 (spikes) induce neutralizing antibodies. Classification : Traditional : Seven groups (A–G), with Group A causing most human diarrhoea. Epidemiology : The major cause of pediatric gastroenteritis worldwide is outbreaks, which are common in areas with poor sanitation and seasonally in temperate zones. Pathogenesis : Transmission : Fecal-oral route. Action : Infects small intestine enterocytes, causing secretory diarrhoea. NSP4 protein acts as an enterotoxin , altering epithelial function. Clinical Manifestations : Incubation : 1–3 days. Manifestations : Vomiting, watery diarrhoea, fever, and abdominal pain. Severe dehydration risk in children. Diagnosis : Specimen : Stool collected early in the illness. Tests : Immunoelectron microscopy (IEM): Wheel-shaped appearance. Antigen detection: ELISA, latex agglutination. RT-PCR : Most sensitive method. G serotype and P genotype detection via RNA typing. Vaccines : Rotavac : Live attenuated G9P[10] strain; three oral doses at 6, 10, and 14 weeks. Rotarix : Live attenuated G1P[8] strain; two doses at 6 and 10 weeks. Bullet-shaped (Option A): The bullet shape is characteristic of the rabies virus, which does not cause gastroenteritis and is not detected in stool samples. Brick-shaped (Option B): The brick shape is associated with poxviruses, such as the smallpox virus, which does not cause diarrhoea. Helical (Option D): A helical structure is typical of viruses like the influenza virus, which does not cause gastrointestinal symptoms.",

      "question": "A healthcare worker who recently returned from the Democratic Republic of Congo develops fever, severe muscle pain, and sore throat. A few days later, symptoms progress to abdominal pain, vomiting, and a maculopapular rash. What is the likely morphology of the virus expected in this case?",
      "options": {
        "A": "Icosahedral and spherical",
        "B": "Filamentous and pleomorphic",
        "C": "Spherical with envelope",
        "D": "Brick-shaped"
      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: B) Filamentous and pleomorphic Explanation: The clinical presentation of progressive hemorrhagic symptoms, including rash and gastrointestinal signs and recent exposure in the DRC, aligns with the Ebola virus, known for its filamentous and pleomorphic morphology, especially in high-risk individuals like healthcare workers. Ebola Virus Family : Belongs to the Filoviridae family. Causes African hemorrhagic fever with high mortality. Morphology : Pleomorphic, filamentous threads, 80–1000 nm (average 805 nm) Lifecycle & Transmission : Reservoir hosts: Suspected to be fruit bats or primates. Initial Transmission : Close contact with blood or body fluids of infected animals (e.g., bats, monkeys). Human-to-Human Spread : Direct contact with blood, bodily fluids, or contaminated surfaces/materials. Risk Groups : Health-care workers, close contacts, and family members of infected individuals. The Ebola virus can remain in semen for up to 3 months. Clinical Features : Incubation Period : 2–12 days. Early Symptoms : Fever, headache, muscle pain, and sore throat. Progressive Symptoms : Abdominal pain, vomiting, severe diarrhoea, and maculopapular rash. Severe Cases : Shock, petechiae, ecchymosis, and high fatality (~50%;). Diagnosis : Antibody Detection : ELISA for IgM and IgG; immunofluorescence. Antigen Detection : Capture ELISA for NP, VP40, and GP proteins; immunohistochemical staining. Molecular Testing : RT-PCR for viral RNA; detectable after 3 days of fever onset. Treatment & Prevention : Treatment : Supportive care (rehydration, symptomatic management). Inmazeb (atoltivimab, maftivimab, and odesivimab-ebgn) – FDA-approved as the first monoclonal antibody treatment for Zaire ebolavirus in adult and pediatric patients. Preventive Measures : Infection control, PPE (e.g., N95 masks, coveralls), patient isolation, avoiding contact with infected materials, and 21-day monitoring post-exposure. Vaccine : ‘rVSV-ZEBOV’ (recombinant vesicular stomatitis virus-Zaire Ebola virus vaccine)- used in DRC to control the Ebola outbreak. Icosahedral and spherical (Option A): This morphology is typical of viruses like adenoviruses, which do not cause hemorrhagic fever. Spherical with envelope (Option C): While common in respiratory viruses (e.g., influenza), this morphology is unrelated to hemorrhagic fevers. Brick-shaped (Option D): Seen in poxviruses, which cause skin lesions but not hemorrhagic fever symptoms like those described.",

      "question": "A 68 y/o man with a history of diabetes and hypertension presents with fever, shortness of breath, and ground-glass peripheral opacities on chest imaging as shown in image below. Which mechanism most likely explains the severe respiratory symptoms he is experiencing?",
      "options": {
        "A": "Viral attachment to ACE-2 receptors",
        "B": "Increased pulmonary surfactant production",
        "C": "Enhanced membrane glycoprotein activity",
        "D": "Cytokine storm causing alveolar and endothelial damage"
      },
      "correct_answer": "D",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: D) Cytokine storm causing alveolar and endothelial damage Explanation: The diagnosis is likely COVID-19 due to the patient's symptoms and characteristic ground-glass opacities on chest imaging, which are commonly associated with COVID-19 pneumonia. Severe COVID-19 can trigger a cytokine storm, which damages alveolar cells and endothelial tissues, leading to fluid retention, impaired gas exchange, and severe respiratory symptoms, especially in high-risk individuals. SARS-CoV-2 Type: Virus, classified as a coronavirus. Size: Approximately 120 nm with helical symmetry. Components: Nucleocapsid: Positive-sense single-stranded RNA (~30 kb) surrounded by nucleocapsid protein (N). Envelope: Lipoprotein structure with embedded proteins, host-derived. Structural Proteins: Spike Protein (S): Facilitates attachment to host cells; contains two subunits: S1 Subunit: Contains receptor-binding domain (RBD) for host cell attachment. S2 Subunit: Mediates virus-cell membrane fusion. Membrane Glycoprotein (M): Most abundant, provides shape to the virus. Envelope Protein (E): Transmembrane protein with ion channel activity. Non-structural Proteins: Include enzymes like RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) crucial for viral replication. Pathogenesis of COVID-19 Host Cell Entry Binding: Spike glycoprotein (S) attaches to angiotensin-converting enzyme-2 (ACE-2) receptors on lung type II alveolar cells. Cleavage: Host proteases (e.g., TMPRSS2) cleave the spike protein, facilitating viral entry via the endosomal pathway. Initial Inflammatory Response Influenza-like Illness (ILI): Infection of the pharyngeal epithelium initiates ILI. Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS) Damage to Alveolar Cells: Impaired type II alveolar cells decrease pulmonary surfactant, causing alveolar collapse and fluid retention. (Option B ruled out) Cytokine Storm: Increased immune cytokine release leads to: Tissue damage and necrosis. Impaired gas exchange and hypoxia. Endothelial damage and microvascular thrombosis. Pulmonary oedema and ground-glass opacities on imaging. Fibrosis and respiratory failure. Multiorgan Failure Elevated cytokines may harm other organs, resulting in sepsis, septic shock, and acute kidney/cardiac injury. Risk Factors for Severe Disease Demographics: Age > 60 years. Comorbidities: Diabetes, hypertension, COPD, CKD and cancer. Viral attachment to ACE-2 receptors (Option A): While viral attachment is a crucial initial step for infection, it does not directly explain the severe respiratory symptoms observed in the patient. Enhanced membrane glycoprotein activity (Option C): Though the membrane glycoprotein plays a role in viral structure, it is not responsible for the severe respiratory symptoms experienced by the patient.",

        "B": "Moderate",
        "C": "Severe",
        "D": "Asymptomatic"
      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: B) Moderate Explanation: The patient's symptoms—fatigue, decreased alertness, and lack of typical COVID-19 fever or cough—align with atypical COVID-19 presentations in older adults. Her oxygen saturation of 92% and the presence of dyspnea fit the criteria for moderate disease (SpO I < 94%). Clinical Features of COVID-19 Incubation Period: Average of 5-6 days (up to 14 days). Common Symptoms Atypical Symptoms Fever Cough with expectoration Fatigue Shortness of breath Myalgia Rhinorrhea (runny nose) Sore throat Diarrhea Loss of smell or taste (may precede respiratory symptoms) Common in older adults and immunosuppressed patients: Fatigue Reduced alertness and mobility Diarrhea Loss of appetite Delirium Absence of fever Children may have less frequent fever or cough. Clinical Severity Classification of COVID-19 Mild Disease Influenza-like illness (ILI) with mild respiratory symptoms (fever, cough, sore throat, malaise). No breathlessness or hypoxia. (Option A ruled out) Moderate Disease Pneumonia without severe signs: Dyspnea, fever, cough. Hypoxia (SpO2 < 94%); respiratory rate ≥ 24/min. Severe Disease (SARI) Severe Pneumonia: Respiratory distress (respiratory rate > 30/min or SpO2 < 90%). (Option C ruled out) ARDS: New/worsening respiratory symptoms; bilateral opacities on imaging; PaO2/FiO2 < 300. Sepsis: Acute multiorgan dysfunction (SOFA score). Septic Shock: Persistent hypotension despite resuscitation; requires vasopressors (MAP ≥ 65 mm Hg). Asymptomatic (Option D): Asymptomatic COVID-19 patients lack observable symptoms, while this patient presents with multiple symptoms, including fatigue and reduced SpO I , indicating she is symptomatic.",

        "C": "Nodular lesions with cavitation",
        "D": "Widespread bronchiectasis"
      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: B) Ground glass opacities and consolidation in a patchy peripheral distribution symptoms of high fever, cough, and difficulty breathing, along with the chest X-ray findings of bilateral multifocal alveolar opacities. The expected CT findings of ground glass opacities and patchy consolidation are characteristic of viral pneumonia, particularly associated with SARS-CoV or COVID-19. Radiographic Imaging in COVID-19 Chest X-Ray: Typically shows bilateral multifocal alveolar opacities. May demonstrate pleural effusions. Not sensitive; 20% of patients may have no abnormalities during the illness. Chest Computed Tomography (CT): More sensitive than chest X-rays but not specific for COVID-19. Common findings include: Multifocal bilateral ground glass opacities. Consolidation changes, usually in a patchy peripheral distribution. No imaging findings can definitively rule in or rule out COVID-19. ACR(American College of Radiology) advises against the routine use of chest CT for screening or diagnosis. Isolated pleural effusion (Option A): While pleural effusions can be present, they are not the primary finding associated with viral pneumonia. Nodular lesions with cavitation (Option C): Nodular lesions with cavitation are more indicative of bacterial infections or certain malignancies, not typical",

Real-Time RT-PCR for COVID-19 Diagnosis Real-time reverse transcriptase PCR (RT-PCR) is the gold standard for ko diagnosing COVID-19. Turnaround Time : The average time from sample receipt to result generation is approximately 4-5 hours. Capacity : Can process up to 90 samples in a single run, making it efficient for frontline testing. (Option A ruled out) Gene Targets : (Option D ruled out) Screening (Genus Specific) : Spike protein (S) Envelope protein (E) Membrane protein (M) Nucleocapsid protein (N) Confirmation (Species Specific for SARS-CoV-2) : RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) Open reading frames (ORF1a/b) N2 nucleocapsid Principle of Testing : Qualitative real-time PCR amplifies target genes in the specimen using a thermocycler. Fluorescence is generated when the amplicon binds to the probe, with the cycle threshold (Ct) indicating positivity. A sample is considered positive if both screening and confirmatory genes are detected with a Ct value ≤ 40 cycles. Detectability : NAAT can be positive as early as day 1 of symptom onset (usually 5 days post-infection) and generally declines by the third week, often becoming undetectable thereafter. Automated Real-Time RT-PCR Systems include Truenat and CBNAAT (Cartridge-based nucleic acid amplification test, e.g., GeneXpert). Widely accessible Turnaround Time : Quick results in 30-60 minutes. Automation : Fully automated with minimal handling, reducing biosafety hazards. Gene Targets : CBNAAT : E gene for screening, N2 gene for confirmation. Truenat : E gene for screening, RdRp gene for confirmation. Disadvantages : Limited to 1-4 samples per run, suitable for low sample loads (24-48 samples/day). Antigen Detection Rapid chromatographic immunoassay (SD Biosensor) for qualitative detection of SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid protein. Sample Collection : Nasopharyngeal swab immersed in viral extraction buffer to inactivate the virus and release the antigen. Point-of-Care Testing : Conducted at the bedside within one hour; antigen stability is limited to one hour. Performance : Highly specific (99–100%) but moderate sensitivity (50–84%); symptomatic but negative patients should be referred for RT-PCR testing.
