The strain isolated is streaked onto a media containing a filter paper soaked with antitoxin. If the strain is toxigenic, it liberates the toxin which diffuses in the agar and meets with the antitoxin to produce an arrow-shaped precipitation band. Used to know the relatedness between the strains isolated during an outbreak. Schicks test Based on the ability of circulating antitoxin to neutralize the diphtheria toxin given intradermally Indicates immunity or susceptibility to the disease. Tissue culture test The toxigenicity can be demonstrated by incorporating the strains in the agar overlay of cell culture monolayers.

      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: B) Iron concentration of blood affects DT production. Explanation: DT production is regulated by the availability of iron; low iron concentrations trigger the expression of the tox gene. High production of DT with low iron availability (0.1 mg/l); iron addition inhibits production (0.5mg/l). Diphtheria Toxin: Aspect Details Production and Structure DT is a protein exotoxin produced by the toxigenic Corynebacterium diphtheriae. Consists of two fragments(Bipartite), A and B, with a molecular weight of approximately 62,000 daltons. (Option C ruled out) Role of Lysogenic β -phage The tox gene is carried by a lysogenic β -phage. Only phage-infected strains produce toxin; nontoxigenic strains can become toxigenic if infected. Corynebacterium diphtheriae remains localized at the infection site, with only the toxin entering circulation, causing toxaemia but not bacteremia. (Option D ruled out) Mechanism of Action Fragment B binds host cell receptors, facilitating fragment A entry into the cytoplasm. Fragment A catalyses ADP-ribosylation of EF-2, halting protein synthesis. Potency The lethal dose for a 250g guinea pig: is 0.0001 mg. The estimated lethal dose for humans: 130 ng/kg body weight. Systemic Effects DT spreads via blood, causing myocarditis and neuritis. Myocarditis is potentially fatal. Factors Affecting Production Influenced by environmental factors: alkaline pH (7.8-8.0), oxygen, and iron concentration in the growth medium. High production with low iron availability (0.1 mg/l); iron addition inhibits production (0.5 mg/l). Toxoid Formation Treatment with formalin (0.2-0.4%), and incubation at 37°C for 4-6 weeks converts DT to toxoid. Toxoid lacks toxicity but induces an immune response; used in vaccines. Immunity Immunity is primarily mediated by antitoxin antibodies neutralizing DT. DT, a DNA virus, integrates its tox gene into Corynebacterium diphtheriae, allowing toxin production (Option A): Diphtheria toxin (DT) is not a DNA virus. It is a protein exotoxin produced by Corynebacterium diphtheriae when infected by a lysogenic β -phage carrying the tox gene. DT enters host cells by binding to DNA, which triggers direct cell lysis (Option C) :DT does not bind to DNA to enter cells or cause cell lysis directly; instead, Fragment B binds to host cell receptors, facilitating the entry of Fragment A, which inhibits protein synthesis by ADP-ribosylation of EF-2. DT primarily causes localized skin lesions, via direct contact with infected individuals (Option D): Diphtheria is primarily transmitted through direct contact or respiratory droplets. Its hallmark symptoms include respiratory distress and a pseudomembrane in the throat , rather than primarily causing localized skin lesions. While cutaneous diphtheria is possible, it's not the main presentation of diphtheria toxin effects.",

      "explanation": "Correct Answer: C) Binding of fragment B to human cell receptors by Diphtheria Toxin (DT). revealing bacilli arranged in Chinese letter pattern points to a diagnosis of Diptheria caused by C.diptheriae In diphtheria caused by C. diphtheriae, Diphtheria Toxin (DT) is primarily responsible for the severe clinical manifestations. Fragment B of DT binds to specific receptors on human cells (Option C) → facilitating the entry of fragment A into the cytoplasm (Option B ruled out) → fragment A ADPribosylates elongation factor 2 (EF-2), halting protein synthesis → leading to cell death. This mechanism contributes significantly to the respiratory distress and other severe symptoms observed in diphtheria patients. Cleavage of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide by Diphtheria Toxin (DT) (Option A): The primary toxic action involves the ADP-ribosylation of elongation factor 2 (EF-2), which results from the toxin's enzymatic activity using NAD as a substrate. Secretion of toxins by Pseudomonas aeruginosa (Option D): It refers to a different bacterium and a different set of toxins . Pseudomonas aeruginosa is not the causative agent of diphtheria, and its toxins are not involved in the pathogenesis of this disease.

      "explanation": "Correct Answer: D) Albert Stain Explanation: Albert stain of Corynebacterium diphtheria shows bacilli with metachromatic granules.

Corynebacterium diphtheria shows chinese letter/ cuneiform appearance Diphtheroids show regular and palisading appearance with lesser number of granules Type Components Function Albert Solution 1 Malachite Green for organism staining Toluidine Blue for metachromatic staining Enhances contrast and specificity in staining. Albert Solution 2 Iodine Specifically targets volutin or Babes-Ernst granules. Procedure: Stain the smear with Albert I stain, then drain and wash it. Apply Albert II stain to cover the smear, then drain it. Application: Corynebacterium diphtheriae are slender bacilli arranged in V or L shapes, characterized by metachromatic granules (polar bodies, volutin, or Babes-Ernst granules) at the poles of the bacilli. Albert's, Neisser's, and Ponder's stains help stain these distinctive granules in the bacteria.

Motility Shows Tumbling and Differential motility(motile at 25.C by forming actin rockets, non motile at 37.C) Pathogenesis Intracellular survival: lysis of phagosome (listeriolysin O) Host cell actin polymerization (cell membrane approach) Direct cell-to-cell spread (listeriopods) Clinical Manifestations Neonatal listeriosis: Early-onset and late-onset disease (Option B ruled out) Pregnant women: Granulomatosis infantiseptica in baby in 3rd trimester Fetal complications (abortion, preterm delivery) Maternal complications (flu-like symptoms, bacteremia, rarely meningitis) (Option A ruled out) Adults: Bacteremia and meningitis (elderly, >60 years) Immunosuppression- higher risk (steroid therapy, HIV, diabetes, malignancy) (Option D ruled out) Post-kidney transplant meningitis (1-month post-transplant) Gastroenteritis (consumption of contaminated milk, meat, salads) Reference: Apurba Sastry Essentials of Medical Microbiology, 3rd Edition Page 699 Mahon Lehman Textbook of Diagnostic Microbiology, 6th Edition, Page 351,352 Granulomatous Motility , Psychrotrophic",

      },
      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: A) Shows the tumbling type of motility at 37°C. Explanation: Listeria shows tumbling type of motility at 25°C and non-motile at 37°C, which is known as differential motility. Laboratory Diagnosis of Listeria monocytogenes: Motility: Shows tumbling type of motility at 25°C. Spreads from cell to cell by forming actin rockets Nonmotile at 37°C, which is known as differential motility. Temperature-dependent flagella expression controls this differential motility. Culture: Grows on blood agar, producing β -hemolytic colonies. Grows well on chocolate agar, which supports its growth. Selective media - PALCAM agar , containing a mixture of antibiotics. (Option B ruled out) Isolation: Isolation from - cervical and vaginal secretions, lochia (postpartum discharge), meconium (infant's first stool), cord blood, blood, and cerebrospinal fluid. Incubation is done under a 5% CO2 environment on blood agar. The cold enrichment technique - effective method for isolation. It involves storing materials in tryptose phosphate or thioglycollate broth at 4°C. (Option C ruled out) Subcultures are performed at weekly intervals for 1-6 months to enhance isolation. Identification: Identification is primarily through biochemical tests- catalase positive. Antibody detection against listeriolysin O can aid in diagnosis. cAMP positive Experimental Inoculation in Rabbits causes marked Monocytosis which is also observed in human listeriosis. (Option D ruled out) Anton Test: Instillation into the eyes of rabbits produces keratoconjunctivitis.
