      },
      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: A) Silastic cup Explanation: In this scenario, a soft Silastic cup would be appropriate and likely effective with the fetal head at +2 station in the left occiput anterior position. Silastic (Soft) Cup: Generally preferred for most vacuum-assisted deliveries due to their: Flexibility, which allows for easier application. Lower risk of fetal scalp injuries compared to rigid cups. Effectiveness in most situations, including the one described in the question. Suitability for both occiput anterior and posterior positions. Malmström (metal) cup (Option B) is a rigid metal cup that provides strong traction, but its use is limited due to the higher risks of fetal scalp injuries. It is typically reserved for challenging extractions or after failed attempts with softer cups. Bird (anterior) cup (Option C) is designed specifically for anterior positions, featuring a low profile to fit beneath the pubic arch. However, it isn't needed for the left occiput anterior position in this case. Kiwi Omni cup ( Option D) is a disposable handheld vacuum device that integrates features of both soft and rigid cups, accommodating various fetal positions. While suitable, it does not confer superiority over standard soft cups in this scenario.",

      "explanation": "Correct Answer: B) Maternal anal sphincter injuries Explanation: Acute perinatal injuries are more common with vacuum application as compared to forceps application. Maternal perineal injuries are more common with forceps application as compared to vacuum as they occupy more space. Subgaleal haemorrhage in the neonate (Option A) , more common with vacuum delivery, is a severe condition involving bleeding beneath the scalp aponeurosis, though less frequent than cephalohematoma. Maternal anal sphincter injury (Option B) , more commonly associated with forceps delivery and exacerbated by midline episiotomy Fetal intracranial haemorrhage (Option D) , serious but rare, can occur with vacuum or forceps delivery, less common than cephalohematoma.

On per vaginal examination, her cervix is 1 cm dilated and 40% effaced, firm in consistency, midposition and the vertex is at -2 station.

      },
      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: C) Discuss cervical ripening options before induction Explanation: This patient’s BISHOP score is 4 , which is not favourable for labour induction, so cervical ripening options must be discussed with the patient. BISHOP Score is Calculated as: Criteria 0 Points 1 Point 2 Points 3 Points Dilation (cm) Closed 1-2 3-4 ≥ 5 Effacement (%) 0-30 40-50 60-70 ≥ 80 Station -3 -2 -1, 0 +1, +2 Consistency Firm Medium Soft Position Posterior Mid position Anterior Total Score: The sum of points from all five criteria. Interpretation: 6: Unfavorable cervix (cervical ripening agents may be necessary) ≥ 8: Favorable cervix for induction (high likelihood of successful induction) Proceed with induction immediately (Option A): While induction can be considered, a Bishop score of 4 indicates an unfavourable cervix, suggesting that immediate induction might have a lower chance of success without prior cervical ripening. Schedule a cesarean section (Option B): Although a Bishop score of 4 suggests an unfavourable cervix, it is not an indication for immediate cesarean section. There are still non-invasive options like cervical ripening that can improve the chances of a successful vaginal delivery. Shift to the observation unit without further intervention (Option D): Shifting to the observation unit before starting cervical ripening would delay labour further and can lead to the arrest of labour.

        "D": "Misoprostol"
      },
      "correct_answer": "D",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: D) Misoprostol Explanation: Misoprostol is avoided in patients with a history of cesarean as it shows higher rates of uterine rupture (6 times more patients with uterine rupture with misoprostol than other uterine stimulants used in the induction of labour in patients with a previous cesarean). Transcervical Foley's catheter is a mechanical method for cervical ripening in those with unfavorable cervix. There is less risk of hyperstimulation as compared to prostaglandins & therefore are an option for women with previous cesarean section. It is also suitable for women with membranes that are intact or ruptured, though generally not preferred with ruptured membranes. Also not used if infection or vaginal bleeding is present. Medications Used in Induction of Labour: Medication Indication Side Effects Dosage and Route of Administration Oxytocin (Option A) Induction and augmentation of labour Tachysystole (>5 Uterine contractions in 10 mins) water intoxication (SIADH) → hyponatremia → convulsions 5 IU is dissolved in 500ml NS → 10mIU/mL of oxytocin → 0.5mIU/drop. Started at 8 drops/min: Makes it 2 mIU/min. Max dose = 52 drops/min: makes it 26 mIU/mL. The infusion rate is titrated until effective contractions are achieved. This can be done with an infusion pump. Dinoprostone (Option B) Cervical ripening and labour induction Tachysystole Remove the vaginal insert if tachysystole is seen. Cerviprime Dose = 0.5mg gel → Applied Intra-Cervical gel Repeated q6 hours Ceridil Dose = 10mg → kept in the posterior fornix of the vagina Kept for 12 hours until the patient goes into labour. Misoprostol (Option D) Not recommended for women with previous cesarean sections. Tachysystole GI upset Uterine rupture in VBAC. Dose = 25 µ g vaginally or 100 µ g orally. Repeated q4 hours Max 6 doses → no Induction achieved → Oxytocin. Reference: 1.

      "explanation": "Correct Answer: D) Kocher's forceps Explanation: This patient is undergoing surgical methods of augmentation of labour. The instrument used for the artificial rupture of membranes in this patient is a Kochers artery forceps .

They are not designed for the delicate procedure of artificial rupture of membranes and are not suitable for this purpose. Simpson forceps (Option B) are obstetrical forceps used for assisting with instrumental delivery of the fetal head during childbirth. They are not intended for the procedure of artificial rupture of membranes. Kielland forceps (Option C) are rotational forceps used in assisted vaginal delivery to rotate and deliver the fetal head.

Mechanical induction releases endogenous prostaglandins from the membrane and maternal decidua, resulting in the induction of labour and cervical ripening. Laminaria Tents: It is made up of dry seaweed , which has hygroscopic action. They swell up in 10-12 hours and open up the cervix. Rapidly improves bishop's score.

      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: B) Water intoxication Explanation: Induction of labour with oxytocin requires close monitoring of fluid intake to prevent water intoxication. Unmonitored infusion of excessive hypotonic fluids can lead to dilutional hyponatremia (water intoxication). It results from the antidiuretic action of oxytocin. Symptoms include nausea, headache, confusion, and severe neurological symptoms like seizures or coma. Regular monitoring of electrolyte levels is crucial to detect and prevent hyponatremia. Adjusting intravenous fluid rates according to patient response helps manage the risk of water intoxication during labour induction.

It is safe, effective and cost-effective. The induction delivery interval can be 8 hours. If induction fails, supplementation with oxytocin infusion can be done. Post delivery management: Suppression of lactation with Cabergoline 1 gm single dose Emotional support and sympathy should be provided to the couple Oxytocin infusion (Option A): Direct use of oxytocin infusion may be done when the cervix is favourable 20 units of oxytocin in 500 mL of Ringer’s solution 30 drops per minute is run ( 80 mU/minute ) Oxytocin infusion can also be used to augment the labour after the use of prostaglandin therapy.
