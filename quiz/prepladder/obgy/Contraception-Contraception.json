      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Levonorgestrel-releasing IUCD (Mirena) provides effective long-term contraception as it is every 5 years and also reduces menstrual bleeding as levonorgestrel hormone thins the endometrial lining, leading to lighter periods and reduced menstrual pain. Lev onorgestrel containing IUCD A)Copper T 380A is effective long-term as it should be replaced every 10 years but, it may worsen the symptoms in women due to increased menstrual bleeding and cramping. C)The Multiload 375 is a copper-containing IUCD, it should be replaced every 5 years and it does not address heavy menstrual bleeding or dysmenorrhea and may exacerbate these conditions. D)Progestasert is a hormone-releasing IUCD that contains progesterone, it needs to be replaced annually,it is less effective at reducing heavy menstrual bleeding compared to Mirena. Type of IUCD Examples Composition MOA Duration Advantages First Generation Lippes loop Non medicated made of polyethylene or other polymers Leads to foreign body reaction producing sterile inflammatory responses 10 years Long duration double \"S\" shape closely fit the contours of the uterine cavity, reducing the chance of expulsion Second Generation (Copper IUCDs) Copper T 380 Copper wire wrapped around the IUCD Releases copper ions which are spermicidal Impairs sperm motility and viability Interfere with the capacitation of sperm 10-12 years Long duration No hormones involved Suitable for those who cannot use hormonal contraception Third Generation (Hormonal IUCDs) Mirena Progestasert Levonorgestrel Releases levonorgestrel (progestin) Thickens cervical mucus Alters endometrial lining May suppress ovulation in some women 5-7 years Lighter menstrual periods Reduced menstrual cramps Protection against endometrial hyperplasia and cancer",

      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "additional contraceptive method for at least 7 days. Correct answer: C) Missing three consecutive OCP pills during the first week necessitates using an additional contraceptive method for at least 7 days. Explanation: Missing three consecutive OCP pills during the first week necessitates using an additional contraceptive method for at least 7 days is correct. If three combined oral contraceptive pills (OCPs) are missed, it is advised to take one pill the next day and then continue the pack as scheduled. Using a backup form of contraception, such as a condom, is recommended for the next seven days. (Option A) If a single OCP pill is missed, a new pack must be started immediately is incorrect. If a woman forgets to take one OCP pill (up to 24 hours late), she should take the missed pill immediately and continue the rest of the pack as scheduled. (Option B) OCPs increase the risk of ovarian and endometrial cancers is incorrect. The combined oral contraceptives (OCPs) have a protective effect against these cancers. (Option D) OCPs can be taken at any time of day without impacting their effectiveness is incorrect. OCPs can be taken at any time of day, but taking the pill at a particular time simultaneously every day is recommended for maximum effectiveness.

They are taken daily to prevent pregnancy by suppressing ovulation, thickening cervical mucus, and altering the endometrial lining. 1. Monophasic OCPs: Contains a fixed dose of both estrogen and progestin throughout the entire pill pack. Each active pill in the pack has the same hormone levels. Helps in reducing side effects and regulating menstrual cycles more predictably. 2. Multiphasic OCPs: contains varying levels of estrogen and progestin hormones throughout the pill pack. It mimics the natural hormonal fluctuations of a woman's menstrual cycle more closely than monophasic pills. It is of two types (Biphasic and Triphasic) Biphasic pills: Composition: Biphasic pills contain a fixed dose of estrogen throughout the entire cycle but vary the dose of progestin in two phases. Phases: These pills are designed to be taken in two distinct phases during the menstrual cycle: First phase: In the first half of the cycle (e.g., 1-14 days), the progestin component is low Second phase: In the second half of the cycle (e.g., 15-28 days), where the progestin component is increased. Triphasic pills: Composition: Triphasic pills contain varying doses of both estrogen and progestin in three phases throughout the menstrual cycle. Phases: These pills are typically packaged in a 28-day pill pack, with the hormones divided into three distinct phases: First phase: low doses of both hormones to simulate the early follicular phase of the menstrual cycle. Second phase: Moderate doses of hormones to mimic the mid-cycle hormonal surge. Third phase: High doses of progestin (and sometimes estrogen) to simulate the luteal phase and prepare for menstruation. Regimen: 1. 21-Day Pack (Traditional Pack): Take one pill every day for 21 days (hormone pills) After finishing the 21 pills, do not take any pills for 7 days Start a new pack on the 8th day, regardless of whether bleeding has stopped. 2. 28-Day Pack (Extended Cycle Pack): Take one active pill containing hormones every day for 28 days. Some packs contain 21 active pills and 7 inactive (ferrous fumarate) pills. Other packs contain 24 active pills and 4 inactive pills. The inactive pills are taken during the last week of the cycle. Withdrawal bleeding (similar to a period) typically occurs during the week of inactive pills. Progesterone-only Pill (Option B), also known as the mini-pill, this contraceptive contains only progestin and it requires strict timing, ideally within the same 3-hour window each day. Implant (Option C) , a small rod inserted under the skin of the arm that releases progestin to prevent pregnancy. Diaphragm (Option D) is a barrier method of contraception that is inserted into the vagina before sex to block sperm from reaching the uterus.",

      "explanation": "has unique properties. Drospirenone may elevate blood potassium levels (hyperkalemia), making it inappropriate for individuals with renal compromise and adrenal insufficiency. (Option B) It resembles spironolactone structurally. Drospirenone blocks androgen effects, helping conditions like acne and hirsutism. (Option A) It acts as an anti-mineralocorticoid, reducing water retention. Monitoring potassium is advised if used with drugs that raise potassium levels like NSAIDs, ACE inhibitors, Angiotensin II antagonists, Heparin, Aldosterone antagonists, and Potassium-sparing diuretics. (Option D) COCs with drospirenone can help manage Premenstrual dysphoric disorder (PMDD). ( Option C) There's a slightly higher VTE (venous thromboembolism) risk compared to other COCs, but the benefits generally outweigh the risks.

      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "contraindication for combined oral contraceptive pills. Estrogen exposure from hormonal contraceptives could potentially promote the growth of hormone-sensitive breast cancer cells. A) A 28-year-old woman with controlled hypothyroidism Controlled hypothyroidism does not significantly increase the risk associated with estrogen-containing contraceptives and is not considered an absolute contraindication for combined oral contraceptive pills. B) A 32-year-old woman with a history of migraines without aura: Migraines without aura are generally not a contraindication for combined oral contraceptive pills. Migraines with aura are considered a contraindication due to the increased risk of stroke. D) A 25-year-old woman with well-managed type 1 diabetes Well-managed type 1 diabetes is not an absolute contraindication for combined oral contraceptive pills. It’s essential to monitor blood sugar levels closely as contraceptives can affect glucose metabolism. Absolute Contraindications of Combined Oral Contraceptives Pills (COCs) Condition Remarks Pregnancy COCs are strictly prohibited during pregnancy. Circulatory Diseases (Past or Present) Women who have a history of arterial or venous thrombosis, severe hypertension, stroke, or heart disease (valvular or ischemic) should avoid combined oral contraceptive pills (COCs). The estrogen component in COCs can raise the risk of deep-vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism. This is because estrogen stimulates the liver to produce fibrinogen and clotting factors, which can contribute to clot formation. Liver Diseases Combined oral contraceptive pills (COCs) should not be used by women with active liver disease, jaundice, liver adenoma, or liver carcinoma. The estrogen in COCs can increase the synthesis of hepatic angiotensinogen, which may contribute to hypertension. Unexplained Vaginal Bleeding COC use is not recommended for women with undiagnosed abnormal genital bleeding. Breast Cancer (Current or Past) Women with known or suspected breast cancer should not use COCs. Major Surgery or Prolonged Immobilisation COCs are contraindicated in women who have recently undergone major surgery or experienced prolonged immobilization due to the increased risk of postoperative VTE. Estrogen-Dependent Neoplasms Women with known or suspected estrogen-dependent neoplasms should avoid using COCs. Smoking and Age COCs are not recommended for women older than 35 who smoke. Diabetes with Vascular Complications Women with diabetes and vascular complications should not use COCs. Migraines with Focal Neurologic Symptoms COCs should be avoided by women experiencing migraines with focal neurological symptoms.",

B)Pelvic Inflammatory Disease contraindicated in insertion of IUCD as it can exacerbate the infection and spreading bacteria into further reproductive tracts. C)Trophoblastic disease is contraindicated in inserting IUCD because there is risk of uterine perforation due to change in uterine tissue fragility following the use of chemotherapy and also it is associated with abnormal vascularization and blood flow in the uterus so inserting IUCD can result in heavy bleeding. D)Wilson’s disease is contraindicated in insertion of Cu-T intrauterine contraceptive as this disease primarily affects copper metabolism causing copper to build up in liver, brain and other organs.

        "D": "Reassurance and observation"
      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: B) Pelvic ultrasound Explanation: The next step in management is to determine the location of the pregnancy to rule out ectopic pregnancy and the location of IUCD. This can be best accomplished with a pelvic ultrasound. Management of IUCD in Pregnancy Confirm Pregnancy Perform a urine pregnancy test. Confirm with an ultrasound to assess gestational age and rule out ectopic pregnancy. Assess IUCD Position Use ultrasound (transvaginal or abdominal) to check IUCD placement: correctly positioned, partially expelled, or displaced. IUCD String Visibility Visible Strings: Gently remove the IUCD by pulling on the strings after explaining the possible risks to the mother. No Strings Visible Continue the pregnancy with monitoring. Risks of Pregnancy with IUCD Increased risk of miscarriage Preterm birth Infection (intra-amniotic infection or septic abortion) Intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR) Combined oral contraceptive pills(Option A) are not appropriate in this scenario as the patient is already pregnant. They would not address the issue of the missing IUCD strings or the management of the pregnancy with an IUCD in situ. Hysterosalpingogram( Option C) is a radiologic procedure that is used to evaluate the fallopian tubes and uterine cavity in non-pregnant females for infertility workup. Reassurance(Option D) is a component of patient care, observation without further investigation could result in missed opportunities for intervention and is not the MOST appropriate next step in this case. Note: If an IUD is present with a desired pregnancy, removal is recommended to minimize pregnancy complications such as miscarriage, preterm labor, and infection. However, if removal is not feasible or the pregnancy is undesired, Pregnancy termination with manual vacuum aspiration should be done.

      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "IUCD use, within the first few months after insertion. It presents with symptoms like fever, lower abdominal pain, abnormal vaginal discharge, and cervical motion tenderness, which match the patient's presentation. Infections with gonorrhea, chlamydia and rarely with actinomyces are seen. Mostly a result of aseptic technique of insertion or pre-existing infection rather than due to IUCD itself A) IUCD-associated heavy menstrual bleeding: This condition is characterized by increased menstrual flow and cramping, not with fever, lower abdominal pain, or abnormal vaginal discharge. Menstrual loss is much less with the use of third-generation IUDs B) Ectopic pregnancy: Present with abdominal pain and tenderness, but it often includes missed periods and may not present with fever or significant vaginal discharge. Incidence of pregnancy is less for women with IUCD compared to normal women Therefore Incidence of ectopic pregnancy is also less in IUCD users But if a woman with IUCD is pregnant—--> Rule out ectopic pregnancy D) IUCD perforation: Typically causes severe abdominal pain soon after insertion and may require surgical intervention. The presence of fever and discharge is more indicative of an infection than a mechanical injury.Ultrasonography can detect the IUD in the abdominal cavity and is better than radiography. SIDE EFFECTS OF IUCD IMMEDIATE REMOTE Cramp-like pain Abnormal menstrual bleeding (most common) Syncopal attack Pain (2nd most common) Partial or complete perforation Pelvic inflammatory disease (PID) Spontaneous expulsion Perforation of the uterus Pain, abnormal uterine bleeding (AUB) & PID are the main factors related to its discontinuation Reference: DC Dutta Textbook of Gynecology, 8th edition, Pg.402,403",

      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "sperm survival and reducing the likelihood of sperm reaching the egg for fertilization. A) Inhibition of sperm motility: This is not the primary mechanism of action of IUCDs. While IUCDs can affect sperm movement within the uterus, their main mechanism of action does not rely on inhibiting sperm motility directly. C) Thickening of cervical mucus: This mechanism is associated with hormonal contraceptives such as birth control pills or hormonal IUCDs (like the hormonal IUD). It does not apply to non-hormonal copper IUCDs, which do not affect cervical mucus. D) Inhibition of ovulation: This is the mechanism of action for hormonal contraceptives such as birth control pills or hormonal IUCDs, but it does not apply to non-hormonal copper IUCDs. Prevention of Implantation: IUCDs modify the endometrial lining, making it less conducive to implantation, though this is a secondary mechanism.

      "explanation": "lowest failure rates at 0.05%, indicating high effectiveness. This method is suitable for a newly married woman who desires reliable contraception without daily adherence. The implant also offers long-term protection (up to 3 years) with minimal user intervention after insertion, making it convenient. Option B) Oral Pills: While pills are commonly used and also effective with perfect use 0.3% failure rate, their typical use failure rate is higher at 8%. They require daily administration and the potential for missed doses affecting efficacy, implants are preferred over pills. Option C) Condoms: They have a typical use failure rate of 15%, making them less effective compared to the implant. Condoms are suitable for dual protection (against pregnancy and sexually transmitted infections) but may not provide the desired level of contraceptive reliability on their own. Option D) IUD: Both the levonorgestrel IUD-0.2% and copper T IUD device- 0.8% have low failure rates, but more than the implant. However, some disadvantages include menstrual irregularities, dysmenorrhea, and pelvic pain due to which implants are preferred. The Pearl Index is an indicator of Couple protection practices in the community. It is defined as the number of contraceptive failures per 100 women years of exposure. It is the percentage of eligible couples protected against childbirth by family planning.",
