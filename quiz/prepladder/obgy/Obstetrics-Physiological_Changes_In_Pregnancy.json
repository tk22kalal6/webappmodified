        "D": "Systolic flow murmur over pulmonary area"
      },
      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: C) Fixed split of second heart sound (S2) Explanation: Fixed splitting of S2 is not a normal finding in pregnancy. A fixed split of the second heart sound indicates atrial septal defect (ASD) or other pathologies that delay right ventricular systole irrespective of respiration. Pregnancy does not cause fixed splitting; instead, it may cause physiological splitting due to increased blood flow, which varies with respiration. In contrast, systolic flow murmurs (especially over the pulmonary and tricuspid areas) and S3 are well-documented physiological findings in pregnancy, resulting from increased blood volume, stroke volume, and preload. These auscultatory findings are benign , soft (usually < grade II/VI), and are due to the increased cardiac output during pregnancy. Normal Cardiovascular Changes During Pregnancy: Category Change Description Clinical Implication Hemodynamics ↑ Cardiac Output Increases by 40–50% due to ↑ stroke volume and ↑ heart rate Ensures adequate perfusion to uterus, placenta, and maternal organs ↑ Heart Rate Rises by 15–30% above baseline Compensatory response to increased circulatory demands ↓ Systemic Vascular Resistance Falls by 25–40% from vasodilation (mediated by nitric oxide, prostaglandins) Causes drop in BP during early pregnancy ↓ Blood Pressure (initially) Falls in 1st and 2nd trimesters, returns to baseline by term Due to decreased SVR; important for monitoring preeclampsia ↑ Blood Volume (especially plasma) Expands significantly, elevating preload Supports fetal circulation; may cause flow murmurs Cardiac Structure ↑ LV Size and Remodeling LV mass ↑ ~30–35% near term; ↑ chamber dimensions without EF or septal changes Normal remodeling process in pregnancy Auscultatory Changes Heart Sounds • Exaggerated splitting and louder S1 • No change in aortic/pulmonary S2 • Loud S3 All are normal findings on auscultation during pregnancy Murmurs • Common: soft systolic ejection murmurs • Occasional: soft diastolic or continuous (mammary) murmurs Typically benign; must differentiate from pathological murmurs Positional Effects Postural Changes Supine hypotension from IVC compression in late pregnancy May cause dizziness/syncope; alleviated by left lateral positioning Abnormal sign: Fixed split of S2 → Suggests ASD or another pathological delay in RV outflow → Not a normal pregnancy finding . Systolic flow murmur over the tricuspid area (Option A): Incorrect because this murmur may occur due to increased right-sided flow. Though less commonly emphasized than pulmonary murmurs, it is within physiological limits during pregnancy. Third heart sound – S3 (Option B): Incorrect because it occurs due to increased preload and rapid ventricular filling, especially common in healthy pregnant women and considered benign. Systolic flow murmur over pulmonary area (Option D): Incorrect because this is the most common benign murmur in pregnancy,",

      "question": "A 30-year-old primigravida at 24 weeks of gestation presents with concerns about several skin changes. She describes a dark vertical line running down her abdomen, dark patches on her face, and pinkish lines on her thighs. She denies any itching, pain, or other systemic symptoms. Her medical history is unremarkable, and she is not on any medications apart from prenatal vitamins. What is the most likely explanation for these skin changes?",

      },
      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: A) Linea Nigra, Chloasma (Melasma), and Striae Gravidarum Explanation: During pregnancy, various physiological skin changes can occur due to hormonal influences: Linea Nigra : A dark vertical line running down the abdomen due to increased melanocyte-stimulating hormone. Chloasma (Melasma) : Hyperpigmented patches on the face, often called the \"mask of pregnancy,\" due to hormonal changes and sometimes exacerbated by sun exposure. Striae Gravidarum : Pinkish or purplish lines, commonly known as stretch marks, which appear on the abdomen, thighs, or breasts due to the stretching of the skin. PUPPP (Option B) typically presents with intensely itchy, red, raised patches that often begin in the stretch marks of the abdomen and can spread to the thighs, buttocks, and arms, but not with pigmentation changes. Pemphigoid gestationis (Option C) is an autoimmune blistering disorder that typically begins with itchy urticarial papules and plaques around the umbilicus. Atopic Eruption of Pregnancy (Option D) Presents with eczematous lesions or pruritic folliculitis, usually without the pigmentation changes described.",

Decreased serum calcium levels could indicate increased calcium demand or issues with absorption. During pregnancy, cortisol levels increase, but this is associated with increased free cortisol levels, not decreased serum calcium levels. (Option A) TBG levels increase during pregnancy, affecting thyroid hormone levels, but this change does not directly impact serum calcium levels (Option B) Initially, PTH levels may decrease in early pregnancy, but they rise later due to increased calcium demand.

      "question": "A 28-y/o woman at 32 weeks gestation complains of occasional indigestion, bloating and painful bulges around the anus with occasional rectal bleeding.

        "D": "Acute viral hepatitis"
      },
      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "IIIII Correct Answer: A) Physiological changes of pregnancy Explanation: During pregnancy, Estrogen stimulates ALP production in the placenta, doubling the levels. The absence of elevated ALT and AST supports this diagnosis over other pathological conditions. Hemorrhoids causing painful bulges around the anus with occasional rectal bleeding are common during pregnancy. They are caused by constipation (d/t atonicity of gut) and elevated pressure in rectal veins below the level of the enlarged uterus. Heartburns, indigestion, and bloating are also changes present in a normal pregnancy. Other GI changes in pregnancy: The risk of peptic ulcer disease is reduced. Gallbladder atonicity (progesterone effect) increases the risk of stone formation Acute fatty liver of pregnancy (Option B) typically presents with profound elevation of ALT and AST levels, along with coagulopathy and hepatic encephalopathy. It is a serious condition that requires immediate intervention and often occurs in the third trimester. Intrahepatic cholestasis of pregnancy (ICP) (Option C) is characterized by pruritus and elevated bile acids, with or without elevated transaminases. It commonly presents in the third trimester and is associated with adverse fetal outcomes. While ICP can cause elevated ALP and GGT due to cholestasis, the absence of elevated ALT and AST makes ICP less likely in this scenario. Acute viral hepatitis (Option D) typically presents with markedly elevated ALT and AST levels, along with symptoms such as jaundice and malaise.

      "question": "A 28-y/o woman in her 32nd week of gestation presents with urinary frequency. Which of the following physiological changes in the urinary system during pregnancy is most likely responsible for her symptoms?",
      "options": {
        "A": "Decreased glomerular filtration rate (GFR)",
        "B": "Increased renal blood flow",
        "C": "Decreased bladder capacity",
        "D": "Increased ureteral tone"
      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: B) Increased renal blood flow Explanation: Increased renal blood flow during pregnancy ensures adequate perfusion of the kidneys, supporting increased GFR by 50% and increased urine production by 50-75% to accommodate maternal and fetal metabolic needs. This physiological adaptation helps maintain fluid and electrolyte balance despite increased maternal blood volume and metabolic demands. Kidneys enlarge by 1 cm in length. Stress incontinence in late pregnancy due to urethral sphincter weakness. Decreased glomerular filtration rate (GFR) (Option A): Pregnancy is associated with an increased GFR due to increased renal blood flow and hormonal changes. Decreased bladder capacity (Option C) can compress the bladder, reducing its capacity somewhat. The primary reason for urinary frequency and discomfort in pregnancy is not decreased bladder capacity per se. Increased intraureteral tone (Option D): The gravid uterus compresses the ureters at the pelvic brim, above which there is increased intraureteral tone, thus causing hydroureter and hydronephrosis, which does not present with urinary frequency. Kidney Ureter Bladder Dilatation of ureters, renal pelvis, and calyces Ureters become atonic due to high progesterone Marked congestion and hypertrophy of the wall Renal plasma flow increases by 50–75% (max at 16 weeks) Dilation and stasis, especially on the right side Increased micturition at 6–8 weeks, subsides after 12 weeks GFR increases by 50%, reducing plasma creatinine, BUN, uric acid Elongation and kinking of ureters Late pregnancy leads to increased frequency due to pressure Tubules fail to reabsorb glucose, uric acid, amino acids, and vitamins Muscle hypertrophy in the pelvic part Stress incontinence may occur in late pregnancy Reference: Williams Obstetrics, 26th Edition, Page 67-70.

        "B": "Decreased functional residual capacity (FRC)",
        "C": "Decreased minute ventilation",
        "D": "Respiratory rate unchanged"
      },
      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: C) Decreased minute ventilation Explanation: Minute ventilation (total volume of air breathed in one minute) increases during pregnancy to ensure sufficient oxygen delivery to the mother and fetus. This increase is a result of Enhanced Respiratory drive d/t stimulation of Progesterone Low expiratory reserve volume Compensatory Respiratory alkalosis Increased tidal volume (Option A) : During pregnancy, tidal volume typically increases to meet the increased oxygen demand of the mother and fetus. Decreased functional residual capacity (FRC) (Option B): FRC is the volume of air remaining in the lungs after a normal exhalation. During pregnancy, the uterus enlarges, causing the diaphragm to be elevated, leading to a decrease in FRC. Respiratory rate unchanged (Option D) : Respiratory rate may remain relatively unchanged during pregnancy due to hormonal changes, particularly the increase in progesterone, which affects respiratory drive.

      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: B) Increased levels of fibrinogen Explanation: Fibrinogen levels increase by 50% during pregnancy. This increase promotes clot formation and contributes to the hypercoagulable state. As a result of a rise in fibrinogen and globulin levels and diminished blood viscosity, ESR shows a four-fold increase during pregnancy Levels of coagulation factors normalize 2 weeks postpartum. Complement factors C3 and C4 levels also significantly rise during the 2nd and 3rd trimesters All clotting factors increase except 11 and 13 Decreased levels of antithrombin III (Option A) : While antithrombin III levels may decrease slightly during pregnancy, it is not the primary factor contributing to the hypercoagulable state. Elevated levels of protein S (Option C) : Protein S levels decrease during pregnancy, contributing to the hypercoagulable state. Decreased levels of Factor VIII (Option D) : Factor VIII levels increase during pregnancy, contributing to the hypercoagulable state along with other clotting factors.

      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "trimester Correct Answer: C) The capacity of the uterus increases by 500-1000 times at the end of the third trimester Explanation: The capacity of the uterus increases by 500-1000 times at the end of the third trimester (around 40 wks). It is primarily due to the growth of the fetus, placenta, amniotic fluid, and hypertrophy of uterine tissues. By term, the uterus weighs nearly 1100 gms and has an average size of 5L. During the first trimester of pregnancy, the uterus undergoes significant changes as it prepares for fetal development. On average, the uterus can weigh around 70g in a non-pregnant woman. (Option A) The uterus starts to enlarge from the early stages of pregnancy and continues to grow steadily throughout all trimesters. (Option B) Uterine size does not decrease during pregnancy.

        "D": "Increased abdominal pressure"
      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: B) Inferior vena cava compression Explanation: The symptoms of shortness of breath due to lying on her back imply a decreased cardiac output. It usually occurs in pregnant women due to compression of the inferior vena cava and aorta by the gravid uterus when lying in the supine position and is called Supine hypotensive syndrome. It leads to reduced venous return, decreased cardiac output, and hypotension. It causes nausea, dizziness and shortness of breath. This condition is relieved by shifting to a left lateral position. Increased uterine blood flow (Option A) : Uterine blood flow is increased from 50 ml/min to 750 ml/min in term during pregnancy. But this does not cause the above symptoms. Increased cardiac output (Option C) : During pregnancy, cardiac output rises primarily due to increased blood volume and heightened metabolic demands requiring more oxygen. The above symptoms correspond to decreased cardiac output due to IVC compression. Increased abdominal pressure (Option D) : As pregnancy advances, the growing uterus displaces organs upward, potentially leading to increased heartburn due to acid reflux, alteration in the position of the stomach, and reduction in lower esophageal sphincter tone. It does not cause the above symptoms. Reference: Williams Obstetrics, 26th Edition, Page 63, 70. DC Dutta’s Textbook of Obstetrics, 9th Edition, Page 49, 51.",

      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "volume Correct answer: C) Increased heart rate and stroke volume Explanation: During pregnancy, the heart rate increases by up to 17%, and the stroke volume increases by up to 27%. As a result of this, Cardiac Output increases as Cardiac Output = Heart Rate x Stroke Volume. (Options A and D ruled out) Due to the elevation of the diaphragm consequent to the enlarged uterus, the heart is pushed upward and outward with slight rotation to the left. The apex beat is shifted to the 4th intercostal space about 2.5 cm outside the mid-clavicular line. Heart rate is raised. A systolic murmur may be audible in the apical or pulmonary area. This is due to decreased blood viscosity and torsion of the great vessels. Mammary murmur: A continuous hissing murmur may be audible over the tricuspid area in the left second and third intercostal spaces due to increased blood flow through the internal mammary vessels. Doppler echocardiography shows an increase in the left ventricular end-diastolic diameters. The left and right atrial diameters also increase.

      "explanation": "Correct Answer: C) Braxton Hicks contractions Explanation: Braxton Hicks contractions are irregular, painless, and usually occur as a normal part of pregnancy, especially in the later stages. They are often described as a tightening of the abdomen without cervical changes. Feature True Labour Pains (Option A) False Labour Pains (Braxton Hicks Contractions) Regularity Contractions are regular, becoming closer together over time Contractions are irregular, no consistent pattern. Duration Lasts longer (30-70 seconds each contraction) Shorter duration (less than 30 seconds for each contraction) Intensity Increases in intensity as labor progresses Less intense compared to true labor contractions Location of Pain Starts in the lower back and radiates to the abdomen Typically felt in the front of the abdomen Progression Causes cervical dilation and effacement, leading to opening of the cervix Does not cause cervical changes or dilation Abruptio placenta (Option B) is the premature separation of the placenta from the uterine wall before delivery. It is associated with mild to severe uterine tenderness, and vaginal bleeding, and often presents with signs of fetal distress. Uterine inertia (Option D) is Characterized by inadequate uterine contractions that fail to cause cervical dilation and are associated with prolonged labor. The woman in this scenario does not present with labor or active labor contractions, making uterine inertia unlikely. Reference: Williams Obstetrics, 26th Edition, Page 52.

      },
      "correct_answer": "D",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: D) Cervical Incompetence Explanation: Cervical incompetence / cervical insufficiency is a condition where the cervix opens too early during pregnancy, usually in the 2nd trimester, without contractions or labor leading to miscarriage or preterm birth. Cervical incompetence may be due to structural weaknesses in the cervix, previous cervical trauma (e.g., procedures like cone biopsy), or congenital factors. It is managed with interventions such as cervical cerclage (a stitch to reinforce the cervix) or progesterone supplementation. Cervical ripening (Option A) is a series of complex biochemical changes in the cervix mediated by hormones ( PGE2 and PGF2alpha). There is an alteration of both cervical collagen and ground substance. Ultimately, the cervix becomes soft and pliable. Misoprostol (PGE1) is currently used for cervical ripening and induction of labor. Cervical Effacement (Option B) or Shortening refers to the thinning and shortening of the cervix as it prepares for childbirth. This is another normal cervical change that occurs in conjunction with dilation during labor. Cervical dilation (Option C) refers to the normal opening or widening of the cervix during labor to allow the passage of the fetus through the birth canal. It is a progressive process, starting from 0 cm (closed cervix) to full dilation (usually 10 cm) for delivery.

Factor Affect on uteroplacental blood flow Function Characteristics Angiotensin II Decreases (Option C) Vasoconstriction It constricts the uterine arteries, which reduces blood flow. It does not increase uteroplacental blood flow. Nitric oxide (NO) Increases (Option A) Vasodilation Relaxes smooth muscles in blood vessels, increasing blood flow to the placenta and uterus during pregnancy. Prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) Increases (Option B) Vasodilation Promotes relaxation of vascular smooth muscle, leading to increased uteroplacental blood flow. Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor (VEGF) Increases (Option D) Promotes angiogenesis 7 vasculogenesis Leading to the formation of new blood vessels and increased blood flow to the uterus and placenta during pregnancy.
