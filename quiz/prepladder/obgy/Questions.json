      "question": "In cases of suspected ectopic pregnancy, which hormone is typically measured?",
      "options": {
        "A": "Estrogen",

      },
      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: C) Beta hCG Explanation : Human chorionic gonadotropin (Beta hCG) is the primary hormone measured in suspected ectopic pregnancy. Key Features: Normal pregnancy: Beta hCG doubles every 48-72 hours Ectopic pregnancy: Slower increase in Beta hCG levels Important diagnostic indicator Estrogen (Option A) : While estrogen levels do increase during pregnancy, they are not specific enough to diagnose ectopic pregnancy. Estrogen measurements cannot determine the location of a pregnancy or distinguish between normal and ectopic implantation. Progesterone (Option B) : Although progesterone levels can indicate pregnancy viability, they cannot differentiate between ectopic and intrauterine pregnancies. Low progesterone suggests a non-viable pregnancy but doesn't confirm its location. LH (Option D) : Luteinizing hormone is only relevant for ovulation and menstrual cycle regulation. It has no role in pregnancy diagnosis or location determination, making it unsuitable for ectopic pregnancy detection. Reference: Williams Obstetrics, 26th Edition, Page 220-226",

      "question": "What is the most effective approach to managing mild nausea and vomiting in pregnancy?",
      "options": {
        "A": "Eat small, frequent meals",
        "B": "Use domperidone",
        "C": "Increase fluid intake",
        "D": "Use metoclopramide"
      },
      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: A) Eat small, frequent meals Explanation: For mild nausea and vomiting during pregnancy, dietary modifications are highly recommended. Eating small, frequent meals can help manage symptoms by preventing the stomach from becoming too empty, which can trigger nausea. Small, frequent meals help maintain stable blood sugar levels Consuming dry biscuits or crackers in the morning on an empty stomach is effective This approach is safe and doesn't require medication It addresses the underlying cause of nausea by preventing an empty stomach Use domperidone (Option B): Domperidone is a medication used to treat nausea and vomiting but is generally not the first-line treatment for pregnancy-related nausea. It is not recommended as the primary approach due to safety concerns and availability of more effective treatments. Increase fluid intake (Option C): While increasing fluid intake is important to prevent dehydration, it is not the primary method for managing nausea and vomiting. Hydration alone does not address the underlying causes of nausea and vomiting in pregnancy. Use metoclopramide (Option D): Metoclopramide is used for moderate to severe nausea and vomiting but is not the first choice for mild symptoms. For more severe cases, medications such as doxylamine combined with pyridoxine, or other anti-emetics, might be considered. Reference: Williams Obstetrics, 26th Edition Page 191",

Serial methotrexate with leucovorin rescue (Option C) is an option for the medical management of ectopic pregnancy, but it is typically used in cases where single-dose methotrexate is not successful or contraindicated. This approach involves administering multiple doses of methotrexate over several weeks, with leucovorin rescue given to counteract the side effects of methotrexate.

Perform the procedure under general anesthesia or diazepam sedation, with or without a paracervical block. Place the patient in lithotomy position, clean the area with antiseptic, and drape. Conduct a bimanual examination to assess uterine size and position. (4) Insert a posterior vaginal speculum to visualize the cervix. Grasp the anterior lip of the cervix with Allis tissue forceps or vulsellum. Introduce a uterine sound to confirm uterine position and measure uterocervical length. (3) Dilate the cervical canal with graduated dilators, applying traction with vulsellum. (1) Curette the uterine cavity using a uterine curette in a clockwise or anticlockwise direction from fundus to internal os. (2) Remove the vulsellum and speculum.

      "correct_answer": "D",
      "explanation": "are safe in pregnancy Correct Answer: D) Ecospirin, methotrexate, cyclophosphamide, corticosteroids, and azathioprine are safe in pregnancy. Explanation: Option D is incorrect because methotrexate and cyclophosphamide are teratogenic and not safe during pregnancy. These drugs should be avoided in pregnant women due to their potential to cause fetal malformations and other serious developmental effects. Methotrexate: A folate antagonist; avoid during pregnancy due to risk of fetal malformations, including neural tube defects and craniofacial anomalies. Cyclophosphamide: A cytotoxic drug; teratogenic and should only be used in pregnancy when absolutely necessary. Other drugs mentioned in the list, such as ecospirin (low-dose aspirin), corticosteroids, and azathioprine, are considered relatively safer in pregnancy and are often used in managing lupus nephritis during pregnancy. Ecospirin (low-dose aspirin): Considered safer in pregnancy; used for anticoagulant effects, especially in antiphospholipid syndrome. Corticosteroids: Safe during pregnancy when appropriately managed; used for lupus flares, but higher doses may increase the risk of gestational diabetes or preterm birth. Azathioprine: Safe for use in severe SLE cases during pregnancy and can be continued if needed. Lupus Nephritis in Pregnancy Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is an autoimmune disorder that commonly affects young women. Lupus nephritis refers to kidney involvement in SLE, which can complicate pregnancy. Clinical Features: Fever, weight loss, migratory joint pain, myalgias. Risks: Preterm birth, preeclampsia, pregnancy loss, neonatal lupus (heart block). Diagnosis: Antinuclear antibodies (ANA) for screening. Double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) for specific diagnosis. Lupus anticoagulant, antiphospholipid antibodies, anti-Ro, and anti-La antibodies may indicate antiphospholipid syndrome. Management of Lupus Nephritis in Pregnancy: Preconception Planning: Pregnancy should be planned 6 months after disease quiescence with no renal dysfunction. Medications: Corticosteroids: Safe for managing lupus flares during pregnancy. Azathioprine: Safe for severe SLE and can be continued. Hydroxychloroquine: Best for maintenance, safe in pregnancy. Avoid: Methotrexate and cyclophosphamide are teratogenic and should not be used during pregnancy. Reference: PMC6430271 - National Center for Biotechnology Information PubMed - 22879437",

      "correct_answer": "D",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: D) Extra-amniotic instillation of ethacridine lactate Explanation: Extra-amniotic instillation of ethacridine lactate is primarily used for second-trimester terminations rather than for first-trimester MTP. This method involves the instillation of ethacridine lactate into the amniotic sac, causing uterine contractions to expel the pregnancy. It is rarely used in modern practice due to the availability of safer and more effective methods for MTP, such as mifepristone + misoprostol.

      "question": "A 25-year-old woman, who is pregnant for the second time, with one living child, and is at 18 weeks of gestation. She presents with a complaint of PV bleeding for the past 4 hours. On examination, her membranes are ruptured, and she is experiencing uterine contractions. A transvaginal ultrasound reveals a cervix that is shorter than 25 mm and funneling of the internal os by more than 1 cm. What is the diagnosis?",

        "D": "Traumatic injury"
      },
      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: A) Cervical incompetence Explanation: The clinical manifestations indicate cervical incompetence due to the features such as leaking per vaginum, uterine contractions, short cervix <25 mm & funneling of the internal os >1 cm. Cervical Incompetence: Cervical incompetence is primarily a clinical diagnosis that indicates recurrent painless dilation and spontaneous mid-trimester birth , usually of a living fetus Cervical incompetence, also known as cervical insufficiency, is a condition in which the cervix begins to efface and dilate painlessly during the second trimester, leading to premature cervical dilation and often resulting in late miscarriage or preterm birth Cervical Incompetence: Characteristics: Painless dilation of the cervix in the 2nd trimester. Characterised by spontaneous, painless dilation of the cervix followed by expulsion of products of conception. Risk factors: Past history of cervical surgeries such as LEEP, conization Cervical trauma (during labour or instrumental delivery) Congenital abnormality Diagnosis: History of pregnancy loss in 2nd trimester: TVUS- investigation of choice Normal shape and length of the cervix- T shaped and 3-4 cm Cervical length ≤ 2.5 cm with one 2nd trimester painless abortion, then diagnosed as cervical insufficiency Non-pregnant women: If Hegar no. 8 dilator can be passed through internal os without any resistance Management: Progesterone and cervical cerclage placement. Incorrect Options: Placenta previa (Option B) : Placenta previa refers to the abnormal implantation of the placenta in the lower uterine segment, potentially covering the internal os of the cervix. A short cervix (25 mm) is not indicative of placenta previa. The predominant indication of placenta previa is bright red vaginal bleeding that is usually painless but is not associated with cervical shortening or funneling. In abruptio placentae (Option C) : The placenta partially or entirely separates from the uterine inner wall before birth. Abruptio placentae is the premature separation of the placenta from the uterine wall before delivery. It typically presents with painful vaginal bleeding and abdominal pain, not necessarily associated with cervical changes. A traumatic injury (Option D) : Traumatic injury to the cervix can cause bleeding, but it is not consistent with the painless dilation and funneling seen on transvaginal ultrasound. Also, traumatic injuries are usually associated with a history of trauma or intercourse. Reference: Williams Textbook of Obstetrics, 26th Edition, Pages 203-205",

      "explanation": "Correct Answer: C) The capacity of the syringe is 30 ml Explanation: A manual vacuum aspiration (MVA) device is a cheap and non-invasive method well-established for surgical abortion in the first trimester of pregnancy . The manual vacuum aspirator is a 60-mL syringe in which suction of around 600 mm Hg is created manually. It is used for termination of pregnancy up to 12 weeks . (Option A ruled out) It can be performed on an outpatient basis under local anesthesia. (Option B ruled out) It generates a negative pressure of approximately 600 mmHg manually. (Option D ruled out) Uses of MVA Syringe Use Description Pregnancy Termination MVA syringes are commonly used for the termination of early pregnancies (up to 12 weeks). The syringe is used to aspirate and remove the contents of the uterus. It is a safe and effective method for induced abortion in appropriate settings. Uterine Evacuation MVA syringes are utilized for uterine evacuation in cases of incomplete miscarriage. The syringe is used to remove retained products of conception from the uterus. Endometrial Sampling MVA syringes can be employed for endometrial sampling or biopsy procedures. The syringe is used to collect a small sample of the endometrial tissue for diagnostic purposes. It is commonly done to investigate abnormal uterine bleeding or to evaluate fertility issues.",

      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: B) Gestational sac size >4 cm Explanation: Expectant management (watchful waiting) involves monitoring without immediate intervention A gestational sac > 4 cm is associated with an increased risk of rupture and complications, making expectant management unsafe. This size indicates a more advanced ectopic pregnancy, which typically requires active intervention, such as medical management with methotrexate or surgical treatment. Indications for Expectant Management: Initial beta-hCG level < 1000 IU/ml & falling Gestational sac size < 4 cm No fetal heartbeat on TVS No evidence of bleeding or rupture Asymptomatic patient Initial serum beta hCG <200 mIU/mL (Option A): Appropriate for expectant management as it indicates very early or potentially non-viable pregnancy. Asymptomatic (Option C): A favorable factor for expectant management in stable patients without concerning symptoms. Decreasing beta hCG (Option D): Suggests possible spontaneous resolution, making expectant management appropriate. Reference: Williams Obstetrics, 25th Edition, Pages 382-385",

      "correct_answer": "D",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: D) 800 mcg Explanation: Misoprostol is typically administered 1 to 2 days (24 to 48 hours) following the ingestion of mifepristone . The recommended dosage of misoprostol depends on the gestational age. For gestations up to 9 weeks (63 days), misoprostol can be administered through vaginal, buccal, or sublingual routes. The recommended dose is 800 µ g for vaginal, buccal, or sublingual administration and 400 µ g for oral administration. Option A, B, C: These options (200 mcg, 400 mcg, and 600 mcg) are incorrect because they represent lower dosages that are less likely to be effective for pregnancy termination at 8 weeks.

        "D": "Chromosome screening"
      },
      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: A) Continue pregnancy Explanation: In most cases of accidental radiation exposure during early pregnancy, the risk of harm to the developing fetus is low. The radiation dose from a typical chest X-ray is relatively minimal, around 0.1 milliSievert, which is considered acceptable during pregnancy. Single exposures to such low doses generally do not result in significant adverse effects on the fetus. Therefore, the appropriate course of action is to continue the pregnancy. Incorrect Options: Termination of pregnancy (Option B) is not recommended in this situation because the risk of harm to the fetus is generally considered to be low. Termination of a wanted pregnancy is a significant decision and is usually reserved for situations where there is a clear and substantial risk to the fetus. Pre-invasive diagnostic tests (Option C), such as chorionic villus sampling (CVS) or amniocentesis, are invasive procedures that are typically performed to assess the risk of chromosomal abnormalities in the fetus. In this scenario, accidental exposure to radiation does not warrant the need for these diagnostic tests unless there are additional indications. Chromosome screening (Option D), such as non-invasive prenatal testing (NIPT), is a non-invasive screening test that analyzes cell-free fetal DNA in the maternal blood to assess the risk of certain chromosomal abnormalities, such as Down syndrome. In this scenario, accidental exposure to radiation does not require immediate chromosome screening unless there are other specific indications.

Key Features: Vacuum pressure: 0.8 kg/cm² to 1.0 kg/cm² (600 to 800 mmHg) Applied over 2-3 minutes Main contraindication is preterm delivery due to increased risk of injury to the preterm infant's delicate skull and brain structures Decreased bear down efforts (Option A) : This is actually an indication rather than a contraindication for vacuum extraction. When maternal pushing efforts are insufficient, vacuum assistance can help achieve successful vaginal delivery. Heart disease (Option B) : Maternal heart disease is not a contraindication and may even be an indication for assisted delivery. Vacuum extraction can benefit cardiac patients by shortening the second stage of labor and reducing cardiovascular stress. Dilatation > 8 cm (Option D) : Greater cervical dilatation is not a contraindication to vacuum extraction. In fact, vacuum extraction is typically performed at full dilatation (10 cm) when progress has arrested despite adequate pushing efforts. Reference: Williams Obstetrics, 26th Edition, Page 537-543",

The score does not take into account the type of maternal pelvis, as the primary goal is to evaluate cervical characteristics. Cervical length (Option A) is a component of the Bishop score. Cervical length is assessed using ultrasound and is an important factor in determining cervical readiness. A shorter cervix is associated with higher chances of successful labor induction or progression of labor. Cervical position (Option C) is another component of the Bishop score. The position of the cervix is evaluated through palpation during a pelvic examination. A more anterior and easily palpable cervix is considered favorable for labor. Dilatation of cervix (Option D) is also a component of the Bishop score. The degree of cervical dilatation is assessed during a pelvic examination. The Bishop score assigns a score from 0 to 3 based on the extent of cervical dilatation, with higher scores indicating greater dilatation. Reference: Williams Obstetrics, 26th Edition, Page 488",

      "question": "In the case of a patient scheduled for dilatation and curettage, if a Sim's sound is inserted into the uterus but no resistance is felt, what is the next step in management according to the available options?",
      "options": {
        "A": "Continue the procedure",
        "B": "Do planned evacuation",
        "C": "Immediate laparoscopy",
        "D": "Mifepristone and Misoprostol"
      },
      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: C) Immediate laparoscopy Explanation: In this scenario, the absence of resistance during the insertion of the Sim's sound indicates the possibility of uterine perforation. This is a serious complication where the uterus is punctured, potentially leading to injury of surrounding organs. The next best course of action is immediate laparoscopy to directly visualize the abdominal cavity and assess for any injuries, thereby preventing further complications. Incorrect Options: Continue the procedure (Option A): Continuing with the procedure after the absence of resistance could lead to further damage and potential injury to surrounding organs. It is not recommended. Do planned evacuation (Option B): A planned evacuation is not appropriate in this situation, as immediate action is needed to assess the extent of the perforation, which would require surgical intervention (laparoscopy) rather than continuing the procedure. Mifepristone and Misoprostol ( Option D): Mifepristone and misoprostol are used for medical abortion or for facilitating labor in specific situations, not for the management of uterine perforation.

      "question": "A patient undergoing treatment for eclampsia at present. When should the subsequent administration of MgSO 4 be skipped?",
      "options": {
        "A": "Absence of knee jerk reflex",
        "B": "Urine output of more than 45 mL/hr",
        "C": "Respiratory rate of more than 14/min",
        "D": "None of the above"
      },
      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: A) Absence of knee jerk reflex Explanation: In eclampsia management, the absence of deep tendon reflexes (such as knee jerks) can be a sign of magnesium toxicity. Magnesium sulfate (MgSO4) is administered to prevent seizures, but an excessive dosage can lead to magnesium toxicity, which depresses the central nervous system, causing loss of deep tendon reflexes. Magnesium Sulfate Toxicity Monitor magnesium sulfate toxicity by observing deep tendon reflexes, respiratory status, and urine output (primarily excreted by kidneys) Impaired kidney function can lead to toxicity. Loss of patellar/ knee reflexes at ~12 mg/dL is an early warning sign. MgSO I Monitoring (Before Each Maintenance Dose): Avoid the next dose if: Patellar reflex is absent. Urine output <30 mL/hour in the last 4 hours. Respiratory rate <16 breaths/min. Serum Magnesium Testing: Routine testing is not recommended. Test 4-6 hours after starting infusion to adjust rate (target: 4-7 mEq/L or 4.8-8.4 mg/dL). Elevated serum creatinine ( ≥ 1.0 mg/dL) to assess kidney function. Check for toxicity signs (diminished reflexes, breathing issues) to confirm diagnosis and guide treatment. Administer fluids cautiously to avoid overload and pulmonary edema. Adverse Effects of Magnesium Sulfate Mechanism: Acts as a smooth muscle relaxant. Serum Magnesium Level Effect 5–9 mg/dL Therapeutic range 9 mg/dL Loss of knee jerk reflex 12 mg/dL Respiratory depression occurs at ~12 mEq/L (14.4 mg/dL) due to muscle paralysis 30 mg/dL Cardiac arrest Management of Magnesium Toxicity: Immediate Actions: Administer 10 mL 10% calcium gluconate IV over 3 minutes to reverse mild to moderate respiratory depression. Discontinue magnesium sulfate. Further Steps: Administer furosemide to increase urinary excretion. Severe respiratory depression requires intubation and mechanical ventilation. The effects of IV calcium may be short-lived if steady-state toxicity is present. Urine output more than 45 mL/hr (Option B) suggests adequate renal perfusion and function. This is a positive sign, indicating that the kidneys are adequately eliminating magnesium and other waste products. Respiratory rate more than 14/min (Option C): While an elevated respiratory rate can indicate potential issues, it is not a specific parameter for withholding MgSO4. Respiratory distress could be caused by various factors, and further evaluation is necessary to determine the underlying cause. Reference: Williams Obstetrics, 26th Edition, Page: 719-721.",

        "A": "Hemorrhagic cyst",
        "B": "Cervical polyp",
        "C": "Cervical cancer",

      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: B) Cervical polyp Explanation: In this case, the patient presents with post-coital bleeding, and a per vaginal examination reveals a vascular lesion that bleeds easily when touched, which is characteristic of a cervical polyp. These are benign growths that arise from the mucous membrane of the cervical canal and are commonly associated with post-coital or irregular bleeding. Cervical Polyp A benign growth in the cervical canal, often found in women aged 30-50, though they can occur at any stage. Origin: Typically from the endocervical canal, occasionally the ectocervix. Size and Shape: Small (few millimeters to 2 cm), finger-like or stalked. Color: Red/purplish (vascular) or pale (fibrous). Symptoms: Postcoital bleeding Intermenstrual bleeding Vaginal discharge Diagnosis: Colposcopy Pap smear/Biopsy: To rule out malignancy. Management: Polypectomy: Histopathology: To confirm benign nature. Incorrect Options: Hemorrhagic cysts (Option A) typically occur within or on the surface of the ovary. They are not associated with post-coital bleeding or lesions on the cervix. Cervical cancer (Option C) can cause irregular bleeding, including post-coital bleeding, but the lesion typically does not bleed on light touch and may require significant friction or manipulation to exhibit bleeding. Cervical fibroids (Option D) are rare and more likely to present with post-coital pain or symptoms related to their size, such as interference with urination, rather than easy bleeding upon touch.",
