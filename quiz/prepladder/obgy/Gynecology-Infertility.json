      "question": "A 35-year-old female patient presents to the clinic for evaluation of her fertility status. She has been trying to conceive for over a year without success. Which of the following is the single best test for assessing her ovarian reserve?",
      "options": {
        "A": "Follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) on day 3",
        "B": "Estradiol on day 3",
        "C": "Anti-Müllerian hormone (AMH)",
        "D": "Serum inhibin levels on day 5"
      },
      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Correct answer: C) Anti-Müllerian hormone (AMH) Explanation: Anti-Müllerian hormone (AMH) levels correlate with the number of antral follicles in the ovaries and provide a direct measure of ovarian reserve. AMH is less variable throughout the menstrual cycle and is considered the most reliable single test for assessing ovarian reserve. Tests for Ovarian Reserve: Test Name Description Key Points Anti-Müllerian Hormone (AMH) A hormone produced by ovarian antral follicles. Blood test reflecting the remaining quantity of eggs. Not affected by the menstrual cycle. The single best test for assessing her ovarian reserve Antral Follicle Count (AFC) Ultrasound count of the small follicles (antral follicles) within the ovaries. Direct visual assessment. Can vary with the cycle. Baseline assessment and monitoring. Follicle-Stimulating Hormone (FSH) Measures the level of FSH, which stimulates the growth of ovarian follicles. Blood test done on day 3 of the menstrual cycle. Initial screening of ovarian function. Estradiol (E2) Measures the level of estradiol, an estrogen produced by growing follicles. Blood test done on day 3 of the menstrual cycle. High levels can mask high FSH levels, so they are used in conjunction with FSH. Inhibin B Measures the level of inhibin B, which reflects the number of antral follicles. Blood test on day 5 of the menstrual cycle. Clomiphene Citrate Challenge Test (CCCT) Measures FSH and estradiol before and after taking clomiphene citrate. Two blood tests: day 3 and day 10. Higher FSH levels on day 10 indicate lower reserve. Used for detailed functional assessment. Follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) on day 3 (Option A): Elevated levels of FSH on the third day of the menstrual cycle can indicate diminished ovarian reserve. However, FSH levels can fluctuate and be influenced by various factors, making it a less reliable single test. Estradiol on day 3 (Option B): Elevated estradiol levels on the third day of the menstrual cycle can suggest a diminished ovarian reserve. However, like FSH, estradiol levels can be variable and influenced by other factors. Serum inhibin levels on day 5 (Option D): Inhibin B levels can reflect the size and function of the ovarian follicle pool, but they can be more variable and less consistent than AMH.",

      },
      "correct_answer": "D",
      "explanation": "Correct answer: D) Causes the release of enzymes for zona pellucida penetration. Explanation: Acrosome reaction causes the release of enzymes like acrosin for penetration of zona pellucida. Acrosome Reaction: The activation of acrosomal membranes causes the release of enzymes , such as hyaluronidase, hydrolytic enzymes, proacrosin, and acrosin, for zona pellucida penetration. Involves fusion of sperm plasma membrane with outer acrosomal membrane. It helps the sperm digest zona pellucida and fuse with the oocyte. It occurs due to calcium influx.

The acrosomal reaction leads to the release of acrosomal lytic enzymes which help sperm penetrate zona pellucida and enter into the oocyte. Capacitation: Physiochemical change in sperm leads to hypermotility and fertilisation capability. It occurs in the female genital tract. Occurs in the genital tract over 2-6 hours before fertilisation. Involves cyclic AMP-dependent phosphorylation. There is an increase in intracellular pH, calcium influx and hydrogen ion efflux - Hyperpolarisation of the sperm plasma membrane.

        "D": "Multifetal gestation can occur as an adverse effect"
      },
      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Correct answer: C) Endometrial thickness should be <8 mm before commencement Explanation: Endometrial thickness should be ensured as <5 mm before starting the therapy. Absence of ovarian cysts/follicles >20mm should also be ensured. These indicate a reduction in estrogen activity. Clomiphene Citrate: Selective estrogen receptor modulator - has both oestrogen agonist & (predominantly) antagonist properties (Option A) Anti-estrogen → reduces negative feedback over pituitary and hypothalamus → increases secretion of GnRH & FSH. Indication: Type II anovulatory infertility (normogonadotropic hypogonadism) Clomiphene citrate is ineffective in hypogonadotropic hypogonadism because it needs a functional HPO axis to increase FSH secretion. Thus, serum FSH levels should be checked before starting treatment in amenorrheic women. Additionally, ovarian cysts should be ruled out to avoid confusion with growing follicles. Dose: 50mg -100mg, can start on either day between the 2 nd and 6 th days of menstruation (Option B) (up to 250 mg/day if not responding). Reduced response: Corticosteroids as an adjunct can be given. Side effects: Hot flushes. Pelvic discomfort. Scotoma. Multifetal gestation (Option D). Ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome.

Explanation: Microdeletions in the AZFb region do not typically result in mild forms of male infertility; deletions in this region are associated with severe forms of male infertility, often resulting in azoospermia (absence of sperm in semen). Y Chromosome Microdeletions Refers to specific deletions of genetic material on the Y chromosome, particularly in regions critical for spermatogenesis (sperm production). These deletions are significant because they can disrupt the normal process of sperm formation. Location and Clinical Impact: Typically, it occurs in three specific regions located on the long arm (q arm) at region Yq11.23. AZFa deletion: Oligozoospermia or azoospermia.

      },
      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Correct answer: C) It may lead to decreased embryo quality and increased risk of miscarriage. and an increased risk of miscarriage. DNA fragmentation can compromise sperm quality, affecting embryo development post-fertilization. Sperm DNA Fragmentation: It refers to breaks or lesions in the DNA strands within sperm cells. Causes: Advanced paternal age. Varicocele. Infections: Genital tract infections. Lifestyle Factors: Smoking, poor diet, and toxins. Pathophysiology: Reactive oxygen species (ROS) from the above-mentioned causes can damage sperm DNA by inducing breaks in the DNA strands. Significance: High DNA fragmentation levels can impair sperm’s ability to fertilise an egg and result in lower pregnancy rates. Poor DNA integrity can lead to abnormal embryo development and reduced implantation rates. Increased DNA fragmentation is associated with higher rates of recurrent miscarriages and birth defects. Assists in predicting outcomes of assisted reproductive techniques like in vitro fertilisation (IVF) and intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI). Tests: Sperm Chromatin Structure Assay (SCSA) Measures the susceptibility of sperm DNA to acid-induced denaturation. TUNEL Assay (Terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP Nick End Labeling) Detects DNA strand breaks by labelling the fragmented DNA ends. Comet Assay (Single Cell Gel Electrophoresis) Measures DNA strand breaks in individual sperm cells. Sperm Chromatin Dispersion (SCD) Test Evaluates the extent of sperm DNA fragmentation based on the dispersion of DNA loops after acid denaturation.

      "explanation": "Correct answer: C) Epididymitis Explanation: Epididymitis is the most prevalent underlying cause of leukocytospermia, as suggested by the patient's increased sperm leukocyte count (>1 million/ml). Leukocytospermia or Pyospermia: Presence of >1 million/ml leukocytes in the semen. Indicates underlying infection or inflammation in the male reproductive tract. Infections: epididymitis, prostatitis, and urethritis. Common pathogens: Chlamydia, Ureaplasma, Mycoplasma. Other conditions: sexually transmitted infections, varicocele, testicular torsion, and erectile dysfunction. Treatment: Doxycycline or erythromycin for 4-6 weeks.

      "explanation": "Correct answer: A) Oligospermia Explanation: Oligospermia is defined as low sperm concentration in the ejaculate (<16 million sperm per ml of semen). Semen Analysis and Normal Values: First investigation for infertility in males. Performed after 1 year of unprotected intercourse without conception or earlier if there are known risk factors for infertility. Abstain: 2-7 days. Analysis: Within 1 hour on the liquefied semen (takes 20-30 min). Parameters Normal (Normozoospermia) (WHO 2021 Guidelines) Volume > 1.4 ml pH 7.2-8.0 Concentration At least 16 million/ ml Total count 39 million/ejaculate Total Motility 42% or more Progressive motility 30% or more Morphology (most important) 4% or more Pus cells (WBC) 1-2 million/ml Viability 54% or more Note: Oligoasthenoteratozoospermia (OATZ) means all parameters are subnormal, as seen in varicocele and smoking. The most important parameters in sperm analysis are Morphology > Motility > Concentration. Reference: Williams Gynecology, 4th Edition, Page 443",
