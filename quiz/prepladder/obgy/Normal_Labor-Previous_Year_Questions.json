      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: B) Wrigley forceps Explanation: Wrigley forceps is an outlet forceps. Wrigley's Forceps: Short, slightly curved blades. Fixed English-style lock. Designed for low or outlet forceps deliveries. It is easier to manoeuvre when the fetal head is very low or visible. Criteria for Outlet forceps Delivery: Scalp is visible at the introitus without separating the labia Fetal skull has reached pelvic floor Fetal head is at or on perineum Head is occipitoanterior or occipitoposterior or Head is right or left occipitoanterior or occipitoposterior position but rotation ≤ 45 degrees Piper’s forceps (Option A) have a distinct perineal curve and are specifically designed for use in breech deliveries, particularly for assisting the after-coming head. Das forceps (Option C) are a lighter and shorter variant of long curved obstetric forceps. They are designed for use in deliveries where the mother has a narrower pelvis and the newborn has a lower birth weight. This design facilitates easier delivery in mid-cavity cases. Kielland forceps (Option D) have a long, almost straight design and are primarily used for rotational delivery. They have an adjustable pivot and are designed to help rotate the fetal head, especially in occiput transverse positions or when there is asynclitism (tilted head).",

      "question": "A 31-year-old female presented with a history of vaginal delivery 2 days ago and complained of pain and sensory loss in the anterolateral aspect of the thigh. Which of the following nerves is involved?",
      "options": {
        "A": "Sciatic nerve",
        "B": "Obturator nerve",
        "C": "Ilioinguinal nerve",
        "D": "Lateral cutaneous nerve of thigh"
      },
      "correct_answer": "D",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: D) Lateral cutaneous nerve of thigh Explanation: The involved nerve is the Lateral cutaneous nerve of the thigh , which can be compressed during labor, leading to pain and sensory loss in the anterolateral aspect of the thigh, often resulting in meralgia paresthetica. Obstetrical Neuropathies: Lateral femoral cutaneous neuropathy (24%) is the most common, followed by femoral neuropathy (14%), particularly after vaginal delivery. Compression of Lumbosacral Nerve Plexus: Occurs during labor due to fetal head descent or use of forceps. Can result in neuralgia, cramp-like pains, sensory loss, or muscle paralysis. Possible foot drop from injury to the lumbosacral plexus, sciatic nerve, or common fibular (peroneal) nerve. Common Fibular Nerve Compression: Caused by prolonged positioning in stirrups during second-stage labor. Nerve Injuries with Cesarean Delivery: Iliohypogastric and ilioinguinal nerve damage. Rare Complications: Lumbar arachnoiditis following epidural analgesia, leading to severe bilateral neuropathic pain. Sciatic nerve (Option A) innervates the posterior thigh and lower leg, not the anterolateral thigh. Symptoms from sciatic nerve injury typically include pain, numbness, and weakness along the back of the thigh, leg, and foot, not the anterolateral thigh. Obturator nerve (Option B) supplies the medial thigh muscles and provides sensation to the medial aspect of the thigh, not the anterolateral thigh. Injury to this nerve would cause symptoms in the medial thigh, not the anterolateral region. Ilioinguinal nerve (Option C) provides sensory innervation to the upper groin, mons pubis, and labia majora, but it does not affect the anterolateral aspect of the thigh. It is not responsible for the sensory loss described in this case. Reference: Williams Obstetrics, 26th Edition, Page 644",

        "D": "Platypelloid pelvis"
      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: B) Anthropoid pelvis Explanation: According to Caldwell–Moloy anatomical classification of pelvis , the radiological findings indicate an anthropoid pelvis , which is characterized by an oval-shaped pelvic inlet with a greater anteroposterior diameter compared to the transverse diameter. Anthropoid Pelvis: Oval-shaped inlet with largest anteroposterior diameter (distance between the pubic symphysis and the sacral promontory) Accounts for approximately 23.5% of female pelves Limited anterior capacity More often associated with delivery in the Occiput posterior position (the most common fetal malposition) Caldwell–Moloy anatomical classification of the pelvis is based on the shape of the pelvis, which helps in understanding labor mechanisms. Specifically, the greatest transverse diameter of the inlet and its division into anterior and posterior segments are used to classify the pelvis as: Gynecoid Anthropoid Android Platypelloid Incorrect Options: Android pelvis (Option A) has a heart-shaped inlet with the greatest width of the transverse diameter positioned posteriorly near the sacrum. This is distinctly different from the oval shape described in the question. This type is more commonly found in males and comprises about 32.5% of female pelvis. Gynecoid pelvis (Option C) appears round to slightly oval with the transverse diameter being slightly greater than the anteroposterior diameter. This is the opposite of the finding described in the question. This is the most common female pelvic type, found in about 41.4% of women. Platypelloid pelvis (Option D) is characterized by a wide, flat inlet where the transverse diameter is significantly greater than the anteroposterior diameter, the exact opposite of the anthropoid type. This is the rarest type, occurring in only about 2.6% of women.",

      "explanation": "Correct Answer: A) Hypotension Explanation: Oxytocin is given to women during caesarean section to decrease blood loss. When given as a rapid I.V. bolus, it can cause hypotension and tachycardia. Different Uses and Recommended Doses of Oxytocin: Induction of Labor: Initial: 0.5-1 milliunits/min IV infusion, gradually increasing by 1-2 milliunits/min every 15-60 min Adverse Effects: Uterine hyperstimulation, fetal distress, water intoxication Augmentation of Labor: Similar dosing to induction Adverse Effects: Uterine hyperstimulation, fetal distress Prevention/Management of Postpartum Hemorrhage: IV infusion: 10-40 units in 1000 mL of solution at 20-40 milliunits/min Adverse Effects: Uterine hyperstimulation, postpartum hemorrhage (with excessive doses) Different Side Effects Of Oxytocin And Their Causes Side Effects Causes Uterine Hyperstimulation High dosage or rapid increase in Oxytocin infusion rate Prolonged administration of Oxytocin Fetal Distress Uterine hyperstimulation leading to decreased blood flow and oxygen supply to the fetus Water Intoxication Prolonged high-dose administration of Oxytocin Nausea and Vomiting Direct stimulation of the vomiting center in the brain by Oxytocin Headache Vasodilation and changes in cerebral blood flow caused by Oxytocin Hypotension Oxytocin-induced vasodilation and decreased systemic vascular resistance Postpartum Hemorrhage Rarely, high doses of Oxytocin may contribute to uterine atony or excessive uterine contractions Allergic Reactions Hypersensitivity or allergic response to Oxytocin or other components of the medication Cardiac Arrhythmias Direct effects of Oxytocin on cardiac electrical activity Maternal Fluid Overload Oxytocin-induced antidiuretic effect leading to fluid retention Uterine Rupture (Rare) Excessive uterine contractions or hyperstimulation of the uterus Reference: Williams Textbook of Obstetrics, 26th Edition, Page 492-493",

      "question": "A 37-week primigravida has mild labor pains for 20 hours, and the cervix is persistently 1 cm dilated but non-effaced. What would be the appropriate management?",
      "options": {
        "A": "Sedation and waiting",
        "B": "Augmentation with oxytocin",
        "C": "Cesarean section",
        "D": "Amniotomy"
      },
      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: A) Sedation and waiting Explanation: The clinical presentation indicates prodromal (false) labor rather than active labor, given the lack of cervical change despite prolonged mild contractions. Sedation and waiting is the appropriate management because: The patient is not in active labor despite having contractions The lack of cervical effacement suggests this is prodromal (false/early) labor Rest and observation is appropriate since: The pregnancy is term The mother and baby are not in distress This is a common situation among first-time mothers When the cervix is 1 cm dilated, it indicates that the body is preparing for labor or is in the early stages of labor. It could be a matter of hours, or it could take several days or even weeks. Preterm labor is the labor that starts before 37 completed weeks of pregnancy. Drugs called tocolytics can be given to pregnant women with symptoms of preterm labor. Augmentation with oxytocin (Option B): Oxytocin augmentation is inappropriate when the cervix is unfavorable and the patient is not in active labor. Using oxytocin in this situation could lead to increased risk of fetal distress. Cesarean section (Option C): An emergency cesarean is not indicated in this scenario as there are no signs of fetal compromise or maternal indication. Amniotomy (Option D): Artificial rupture of membranes is contraindicated when the cervix is unfavorable and the patient is not in active labor. Early amniotomy can increase the risk of infection and cord prolapse without improving labor progress. Reference: William’s Textbook of Obstetrics, 26th edition, Pages 409-415",

      "question": "Which of the following is recommended by the World Health Organization (WHO) for the management of the second stage of labor?",
      "options": {
        "A": "Mandatory episiotomy",
        "B": "Manual perineal support and warm compresses",
        "C": "Maintain head in deflexion and deliver",
        "D": "Deliver in lithotomy position only"
      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Correct answer: B) Manual perineal support and warm compresses Explanation: Manual perineal support and warm compresses are recommended by the WHO for the management of the second stage of labor. Second stage of labor: Refers to the time period from full cervical dilation to the delivery of the fetus. During this stage, perineal massage with lubricants and warm compresses can help soften and stretch the perineum. This approach may reduce the risk of third- and fourth-degree perineal tears. Mandatory episiotomy (Option A) is now discouraged by the WHO due to evidence showing it doesn’t prevent severe tears and may increase postnatal discomfort, sexual dysfunction, and complications. It is only recommended when medically indicated, such as in cases of shoulder dystocia, fetal macrosomia, breech delivery, operative vaginal delivery, or persistent OP positions. Maintain head in deflexion and deliver (Option C): Keeping the fetal head in deflexion during delivery is not recommended as it can lead to complications like shoulder dystocia and neck or nerve damage. Deliver in lithotomy position only (Option D): WHO does not recommend delivering exclusively in the lithotomy position. While common, it is not the only option. Women are encouraged to choose the most comfortable position, such as squatting or hands-and-knees, for a more natural and less interventionist birth.

        "D": "Early cord clamping"
      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: B) Controlled cord traction Explanation: Controlled cord traction is a component of active management of the third stage of labor (AMTSL). Steps of AMTSL: Use of uterotonic (oxytocin) after the birth of the baby (5-10 IU IM) at delivery of the anterior shoulder, before delivery of the placenta. (Option A) Delayed cord clamping ( ≥ 1-3 minutes). (Option D) Wait for 60 seconds. Increases the Hb of the baby by 1g% (preventing neonatal anemia). Contraindicated in: Fetal distress HIV/HbsAg positive mother Rh-negative mother Delivery of the placenta by controlled cord traction (Modified Brandt Andrews method). Intermittent assessment of uterine tone. Advantages of AMTSL Minimised Blood Loss Shortened Duration Disadvantages Slightly increased incidence of retained placenta Risk of asphyxia in the second twin if administered prematurely. Indications High-risk factors include anaemia, hydroamnios, twins, grand multiparae, and a previous history of postpartum haemorrhage (PPH). Uterine massage (Option C) is not recommended for preventing postpartum hemorrhage (PPH) in women who have received prophylactic uterotonics such as oxytocin. It is now considered an optional component of AMTSL and is primarily used in managing uterine atony during PPH. Reference: Williams Obstetrics, 26th Edition, Page 506",

Whereas all other muscles in given options are cut during mediolateral episiotomy . Episiotomy: Episiotomy surgically planned incision on the perineum and posterior vaginal wall performed during the second stage of labor (ideally performed just before crowning ) to enlarge the vaginal introitus for easier and safer delivery and also to prevent overstretching and rupture of perineal muscles. This is considered a second-degree perineal injury. Indications: Rigid perineum Anticipating perineal tear (big baby, face-to-pubis delivery, breech, shoulder dystocia) Operative delivery Previous perineal surgery Types of episiotomy: Type Advantages Disadvantages Mediolateral (most prevalent) Reduced risk of severe perineal tears. May facilitate easier delivery. Less risk of injury to the anal sphincter compared to the midline. Higher risk of postpartum pain and discomfort. Potential for increased blood loss compared to other types. Median Simplicity in execution. Less postoperative pain compared to mediolateral. Higher risk of severe perineal tears, including anal sphincter injury. Potential for increased healing time and complications due to midline orientation.

        "C": "Pelvic grip",
        "D": "Fundal grip"
      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: B) Lateral grip Explanation: The lateral grip is a technique used during labor to assess the descent and rotation of the fetal head. It involves placing the hands on either side of the fetal head to feel for specific movements and changes in position. This grip allows the healthcare provider to monitor the progress of labor and ensure that the baby is moving through the birth canal in the appropriate manner. By placing the hands on either side of the fetal head, the healthcare provider can feel for the movement of the head as it descends and rotates during contractions. The lateral grip helps assess the position of the fetal head in relation to the pelvis and the progress of labor. During labor, the fetal head should gradually descend and rotate to align with the birth canal. The lateral grip allows the healthcare provider to detect any deviations or abnormalities in this process, such as malpositioning or inadequate descent. This information helps guide interventions or decision-making regarding the management of labor. The Pawlik's grip (Option A) aids in confirming the fetal presentation. The examiner uses their thumb and fingers to grasp the lower portion of the maternal abdomen just above the symphysis pubis. If the presenting part is not engaged, a mobile mass, typically the head, will be felt. Differentiating between the head and breech is similar to the first maneuver. The Pelvic grip (Option C) helps assess the degree of fetal descent. With the examiner facing the mother's feet, the fingertips of both hands are placed on either side of the presenting part. By exerting inward pressure and then sliding caudally along the pelvic inlet, the examiner can often differentiate",

      "explanation": "Correct Answer: B) Nulliparous, singleton, cephalic, spontaneous labour Explanation: Modified Robson's classification is a system used to categorize and compare cesarean section rates in different groups of women undergoing childbirth. Class 1 specifically refers to nulliparous women (those who have not previously given birth) with a singleton pregnancy (one fetus) in a cephalic presentation (head-first) (Option A, C, D ruled out) and undergoing spontaneous labor. This classification helps in analyzing and comparing cesarean section rates within similar groups of women, aiding in quality improvement initiatives and research.

      "correct_answer": "D",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: D) Right occipito-anterior Explanation: The given image represents the right occipito-anterior position, which means that the baby’s occiput is positioned toward the right side of the mother’s pelvis and is facing the front (anterior) of the pelvis. The term \" position \" refers to the orientation of a specific part of the fetus in relation to the maternal birth canal, either to the right or left side. The fetal landmarks used for identification in various presentations are the occiput (for occipital presentation), chin (for face presentation), and sacrum (for breech presentation). Depending on which side of the mother’s pelvis the presenting part is located, the positions are designated as left or right occipital (LO and RO), left or right mental (LM and RM), and left or right sacral (LS and RS). Additionally, the position of the defined landmark is described in relation to the anterior (A), transverse (T), or posterior (P) parts of the maternal pelvis. In right occipito-posterior (Option A), the baby's occiput is toward the right side of the mother's pelvis but facing the back (posterior) of the pelvis. In this scenario, the baby's back would be positioned more towards the mother's back. The left occipito-anterior position (Option B) describes the occiput of the baby being toward the left side of the mother's pelvis and facing the front (anterior) of the pelvis. The left occipito-posterior position (Option C) indicates that the baby's occiput is positioned toward the left side of the mother's pelvis but facing the back (posterior) of the pelvis. In this case, the baby's back would be positioned more towards the mother's back.",

It is a critical measurement used to assess the adequacy of the pelvic inlet for vaginal delivery. True Conjugate (Conjugata Vera) The shortest distance between the sacral promontory and the superior margin of the pubic symphysis. Determines pelvic inlet adequacy for vaginal delivery; <9.5 cm suggests possible cephalopelvic disproportion (CPD). Diagonal Conjugate (Option C) The distance between the sacral promontory and the lower margin of the pubic symphysis, measured via the vaginal exam. Estimates true conjugate; <12 cm may indicate a narrow pelvic inlet. Obstetric Conjugate (Option B) The shortest distance between the sacral promontory and the posterior surface of the pubic symphysis. Assesses pelvic cavity adequacy for fetal head passage; inadequate may lead to obstructed labor. Distance from the posterior margin of the sacral promontory to the symphysis pubis (Option D): This is another description of the true conjugate but is less precise than option A. The correct anatomical definition refers to the midpoint of the sacral promontory, not the posterior margin.",

      "question": "A primigravida presents with labor pain, and on per vaginal examination, her cervix is 7 cm dilated and fully effaced. What stage of labor is she in?",
      "options": {
        "A": "Acceleration phase",
        "B": "Latent phase",
        "C": "Deceleration phase",
        "D": "The phase of maximum slope"
      },
      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: A) Acceleration phase Explanation: The acceleration phase refers to the period of active cervical dilation, typically occurring from about 4 cm to full dilation (10 cm). During this phase, contractions become more intense, frequent, and regular, leading to progressive cervical dilation. Since the cervix is 7 cm dilated and fully effaced, the patient is in the active phase of labor, which is the acceleration phase. Stages of Labor Stage Definition Features Contractions First Stage Onset of labor to full cervical dilatation (10 cm). Latent Phase: Early cervical changes with slower progress. Active Phase: Faster cervical dilatation ( ≥ 5 cm) with regular contractions. Cervical dilatation and effacement occur. Intermittent painful uterine contractions. \"Show\" (blood-stained mucus) is common. Active labor starts at cervical dilatation ≥ 5 cm with regular contractions. Latent Phase: Irregular and mild. Active Phase: Regular; 3–5 min apart, lasting ~45 seconds. Second Stage From complete cervical dilatation (10 cm) to fetal delivery. Begins after complete cervical dilation. Ends with the delivery of the baby. Strong and frequent; 2–3 minutes apart. Third Stage From fetal delivery to placental expulsion. Placental separation and expulsion occur. Average duration: 5–15 minutes. Mild uterine contractions to aid placental expulsion. Fourth Stage Observation for at least 1 hour after placental expulsion. Monitoring for postpartum hemorrhage and uterine contraction. Uterine contractions continue, aiding hemostasis. Incorrect Options: The latent phase (Option B) is the early phase of labor, during which the cervix dilates from 0 to 6 cm. It is characterized by milder, less frequent contractions. Since the cervix is already 7 cm dilated, the patient is beyond the latent phase. The term deceleration phase (Option C) is not a standard term used to describe the stages of labor. Deceleration generally refers to a decrease in the fetal heart rate, which may occur during labor and is typically monitored as a potential sign of distress, not a stage of labor. The “phase of maximum slope” (Option D) is not a recognized term in the context of the stages of labor. Reference: Williams Obstetrics, 25th Edition, Page: 435, 439.

      "question": "Which of the subsequent techniques for cervical ripening belongs to the category of hygroscopic dilators?",
      "options": {
        "A": "Intracervical dinoprostone gel",
        "B": "Intracervical laminaria tent",
        "C": "Foley catheter at internal of cervix",
        "D": "Misoprostol in posterior fornix"
      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: B) Intracervical laminaria tent Explanation: Cervical ripening refers to the process of softening and dilating the cervix in preparation for labor or a gynecological procedure. One of the methods for cervical ripening involves the use of hygroscopic dilators, which work by absorbing moisture from surrounding tissues to gradually expand and dilate the cervix. Intracervical laminaria tent is a hygroscopic dilator. Laminaria tents are derived from the dried stems of seaweed. When placed in the cervix, they absorb moisture and expand, gradually dilating the cervix. This method is slow and controlled, often preferred for gentle and gradual ripening. Intracervical dinoprostone gel (Option A): Dinoprostone gel (prostaglandin E2) promotes cervical ripening by softening and thinning the cervix, but it does not work through hygroscopic properties. It is a pharmacological agent used for cervical ripening. Foley catheter at internal of cervix (Option C): A Foley catheter is a mechanical method for cervical ripening. It involves the insertion of a balloon-tipped catheter into the cervix, which is inflated with sterile water or saline to apply pressure. This method does not involve hygroscopic properties but instead works through mechanical dilation Misoprostol in posterior fornix (Option D): Misoprostol is a medication used for cervical ripening, but it does not work through hygroscopic mechanisms. It is typically administered orally or vaginally to induce ripening, and its mode of action is through pharmacological pathways rather than absorption of moisture.",
