      "question": "Hormone Replacement Therapy is truly associated with which of the following?",
      "options": {
        "A": "Decreased risk of breast cancer",
        "B": "Decreased risk of endometrial cancer",
        "C": "Increased risk of osteoporosis",
        "D": "Decreased risk of colon cancer"
      },
      "correct_answer": "D",
      "explanation": "Correct answer: D) Decreased risk of colon cancer Explanation: The true association of hormone replacement therapy is with a decreased risk of colon cancer. Hormone replacement therapy This is used for the treatment of menopausal symptoms They are usually estrogen and occasionally in combination with progesterone HRT decreases the risk of colon cancer due to the protective effects of estrogen Hence, the incidence of colon cancer is rare amongst women of reproductive age group compared to men of the same age group Indications of HRT: Therapeutic: Symptomatic menopausal women Gonadal dysgenesis in adolescents Prophylactic: Patients at high risk for menopausal complications like cardiovascular disease, osteoporosis, stroke, colon cancer, etc Premature menopause: Spontaneous following surgery or cancer therapy Breast cancer risk (Option A) is increased by hyperestrogenism. Breast cancer following HRT is usually low-grade and shows a good prognosis. Estrogen replacement (Option B) can increase the risk of well-differentiated endometrial carcinoma. The addition of progesterone to estrogen reduces the risk of endometrial cancer. After menopause, bone density decreases every year, leading to osteopenia and, eventually, osteoporosis (Option C) . Osteoporosis would usually result in fractures of vertebrae, femur and wrist. HRT using estrogen protects against osteoporosis and decreases the risk of fractures.

      "question": "A 62-year-old patient with a history of diabetes and hypertension came with post-menopausal bleeding. Which of the following will you do to evaluate the cause?",
      "options": {
        "A": "Pap smear",
        "B": "Visual inspection with iodine",
        "C": "Colposcopy",
        "D": "Endometrial sampling"
      },
      "correct_answer": "D",
      "explanation": "Correct answer: D) Endometrial sampling Explanation: Endometrial sampling is done to evaluate patients with post-menopausal bleeding. Indications for Endometrial Biopsy: Abnormal uterine bleeding Atypical glandular or endometrial cells on cervical cytology Cancer screening (e.g., hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal cancer) Follow-up and surveillance of previously diagnosed endometrial hyperplasia Postmenopausal bleeding Transvaginal ultrasonography (TVS) is the first-line investigation for evaluating postmenopausal bleeding. Since TVS is not among the available options, endometrial sampling becomes the best choice in this case. Pap smear (Option A): Primarily used for cervical cancer screening in women over 21 who have been sexually active for at least three years. It does not assess the endometrium, making it unsuitable for postmenopausal bleeding. Visual inspection with iodine (Option B) , also called Schillerâ€™s test, detects cervical abnormalities in facilities lacking Pap smear access. It evaluates the cervix and vagina as in cases of carcinoma cervix, not the endometrium, and is inappropriate for postmenopausal bleeding. Colposcopy (Option C) examines the cervix, vagina, and vulva. It is challenging in postmenopausal women due to a narrowed vagina, senile vaginitis, poorly visible squamocolumnar junction, and atrophied cervix.
