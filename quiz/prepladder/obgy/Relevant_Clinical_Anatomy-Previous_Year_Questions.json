        "A": "Decidua parietalis",
        "B": "Decidua basalis",
        "C": "Chorionic plate",
        "D": "Spiral arteries"
      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: B) Decidua basalis Explanation: The placenta is attached to the maternal body by Decidua basalis. The maternal surface of the placenta is rough and spongy The maternal surface is mapped out into 15-20 somewhat convex polygonal areas known as lobes or cotyledons Each fissure is occupied by the decidual septum, which is derived from the basal plate Only the decidua basalis and the blood in the intervillous space are of maternal origin Decidua parietalis (Option A) lines the fetal membranes and is not the attachment point to the maternal body. Chorionic plate (Option C) lies internally, and the umbilical cord is attached to this plate; it is not the surface that attaches to the maternal body. Spiral arteries (Option D) supply blood by piercing the basal plate of placenta; they are vessels within the maternal tissue but are not the attachment point of the placenta",

      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: B) Posterior 1/3rd of labia majora Explanation: The Bartholin gland, also known as the greater vestibular gland , is located at the junction of the anterior 2/3rd and posterior 1/3rd of the vulva. These glands function to provide lubrication to the vagina during intercourse . The gland's epithelium varies: Gland: columnar epithelium Duct: stratified squamous epithelium Terminal part of duct: transitional epithelium Bartholin Cyst: Develops when the gland's duct becomes blocked Can become infected, leading to an abscess Often caused by mixed infections, including Staphylococcus aureus Treatment Options: Drainage using a Word catheter Marsupialization - cyst is incised and edges are everted Excision is generally not advised unless absolutely necessary Reference: William’s Gynecology, 4th Edition, Page 86, 103, 815",

      "question": "A 28-year-old multigravida comes to the emergency at night with an inversion of the uterus following the delivery of the baby when the nurse waited till the delivery of the placenta. Her BP is 110/70 mmHg, and pulse rate is 90 bpm. What should be the management in this case?",
      "options": {
        "A": "Manually remove the placenta and reposition the uterus",
        "B": "Reposition the uterus inside without removing the placenta",
        "C": "Shift to the operating theatre and reinsert the uterus under general anesthesia",
        "D": "Start oxytocin infusion"
      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Correct answer: B) Reposition the uterus inside without removing the placenta Explanation: In cases of uterine inversion with the placenta still attached, the immediate priority is to reposition the uterus without removing the placenta to prevent further hemorrhage and uterine contraction, which would complicate repositioning. The management of uterine inversion should follow the following steps: Immediate call for assistance (obstetric and anaesthesia personnel) Blood is brought to the delivery room to use when needed Two large bore IV lines are secured, and crystalloids are given to treat hypovolemia till the blood is brought The woman is evaluated for emergency general anaesthesia Stop tocolytics Start oxytocin Give antibiotics The steps of management of uterine inversion according to certain factors are as follows: Condition Method Inverted uterus not contracted and retracted completely The placenta has already separated Replace the uterus by pushing the inverted fundus using your palm and fingers The placenta is still attached Reposition the uterus with the placenta in situ Tocolytics may be used for uterine relaxation If they fail, general anaesthesia (inhalational) is used The uterus is replaced, and the placenta removed Failed uterine reposition with attached placenta The placenta is peeled off, and repositioning is attempted again Failed manual repositioning Surgical repositioning (Huntington’s procedure) Manually removing the placenta and repositioning the uterus (Option A) will lead to increased haemorrhage and faster contraction of the uterus, making it difficult to replace the uterus. Hence, this is not the preferred step. Shift to the operating theatre (OT) and reinsert the uterus under general anaesthesia (Option C): General anesthesia and surgical repositioning are reserved for failed manual repositioning attempts. Start oxytocin infusion (Option D) : If oxytocin infusion is continued, the uterus will contract and lead to difficulty in its repositioning, so tocolytics are used to relax the uterus, and then once the repositioning is completed, oxytocin infusion and bimanual compression are started to aid uterine contraction.",

      "question": "Which of the following hormones are secreted by sertoli cells and Leydig cells respectively?",
      "options": {
        "A": "DHA and testosterone",
        "B": "Testosterone and inhibin",
        "C": "Testosterone and DHA",
        "D": "Inhibin and testosterone"
      },
      "correct_answer": "D",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: D) Inhibin and testosterone Explanation: Inhibin and testosterone are secreted by sertoli cells and Leydig cells respectively. Leydig Cells: These interstitial cells are responsible for androgen biosynthesis, primarily testosterone and androstenedione, regulating secondary sex characteristics. Involved in testicular descent, development of the prostate, scrotum, penis, and differentiation of the Wolffian duct, forming the epididymides, vasa deferentia, and seminal vesicles. Sertoli Cells: Also known as sustentacular cells, they are pyramid-shaped cells within the seminiferous epithelium, with their bases against the basement membrane and tips toward the lumen. Sertoli cells nurture and provide structural support for spermatogenic cells, accommodating their movement as they mature from the base to the lumen of seminiferous tubules. Sertoli cells secrete androgen-binding protein, inhibin , and anti-Müllerian hormone (in the fetus). They also convert testosterone to estrogen and DHT. Option A & C: DHA (Docosahexaenoic acid) is an omega-3 fatty acid and not a hormone. It is important for brain and eye health.

      "question": "Which of the following is incorrect regarding the innervation of the uterus?",
      "options": {
        "A": "Sensory level is from T10 to L1",
        "B": "Uterine contractility is mediated by innervations from level T7-T8",
        "C": "In the 1st stage of labor, pain is due to the fibres at the level of T10-L1",
        "D": "In early labor, pain is usually because of uterine contraction"
      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: B) Uterine contractility is mediated by innervations from level T7-T8 Explanation: Uterine contractions are primarily mediated by hormonal factors such as estrogen, prostaglandins, and oxytocin, rather than specific innervations at T7-T8. Progesterone plays a role in relaxing the uterus. The innervation of the uterus primarily affects sensory pathway s and does not directly govern uterine contractility. Sage of Labor Cause of Pain Nerves and Plexuses Involved Preferred Anesthesia First Stage (Latent Phase) Uterine contractions and cervical dilation. T10–L1 Sympathetic fibers from the uterine and hypogastric plexuses None or Low-dose Epidural First Stage (Active Phase) Intense uterine contractions and progressive cervical dilation. T10–L1 Sacral plexus Epidural Anesthesia Spinal Anesthesia Second Stage Distension of the vaginal canal, pelvic floor, and perineum. S2–S4 Pudendal nerve Epidural Anesthesia Spinal Anesthesia Third Stage (Placental Phase) Uterine contractions and manipulation during placenta expulsion or perineal repair. S2–S4 Pudendal nerve Local Anesthesia Sensory level is from T10 to L1 (Option A) : This is correct. The sensory innervation of the uterus, particularly for pain perception, involves afferent fibers passing through the inferior hypogastric plexus and entering the spinal cord at T10-T12 and L1 levels. In the 1st stage of labor, pain is due to the fibres at the level of T10-L1 (Option C) : This is correct. During the first stage of labor, pain is caused by the distension of the cervix and lower uterine segments, which are mediated by the sensory fibers in the T10-L1 spinal segments. In early labor, pain is usually because of uterine contraction (Option D) : This is correct. Pain during early labor is primarily due to the contraction of the uterus, which causes ischemia and activates nociceptors in the uterine and cervical tissues.

Cervical length: Measured from the internal to the external os. 2-4 cm (up to 5 cm) in non-pregnant women. 3-5 cm in early pregnancy as it stretches. A short cervix during pregnancy increases the risk of early labor and delivery, making it an essential measure to monitor. Reference: Williams Gynecology, 4th Edition, Page 973",

      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "Correct answer: A) Cusco’s speculum Explanation: The instrument shown in the image is Cusco’s speculum. Cusco's Self-Retaining Speculum: A bivalve speculum that provides good exposure of the cervix when introduced into the vagina. Uses: Outpatient gynecological examinations. Obtaining Pap smears. Performing cervical biopsies. Removal of small cervical polyps. Advantage: Self-retaining design eliminates the need for an assistant. Disadvantage: Covers both the anterior and posterior vaginal walls, which can lead to missed diagnoses of conditions like vaginal fistulas. Sim’s speculum (Option B) is a single-bladed instrument used to hold the vaginal walls apart during examinations. Requires manual assistance and is commonly used for detailed gynecological procedures involving the cervix or endometrium. Proctoscope (Option C) is designed for anorectal visualization. Used for conditions like hemorrhoids and rectal polyps, but unsuitable for gynecological examinations. Doyen’s retractor (Option D) is a surgical instrument used to retract the abdominal wall and bladder to better view the lower uterine segment during gynecological surgeries.",

        "A": "Pouch of Douglas",
        "B": "Leaves of broad ligament",
        "C": "Uterovesical pouch",
        "D": "Iliac fossa"
      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: B) Leaves of broad ligament Explanation: The Wolffian ducts, also known as the mesonephric ducts, are embryonic structures that contribute to the development of the male reproductive system in the early stages of fetal development. In females, these ducts normally regress and do not play a significant role in the development of the reproductive system. However, remnants of the Wolffian ducts can still be found in females in certain areas. Leaves of broad ligament: The broad ligament is a double-fold peritoneum that supports the uterus, fallopian tubes, and ovaries. In females, the remnants of the Wolffian ducts can be found within the leaves of the broad ligament. Incorrect Options: The Pouch of Douglas (Option A) , also known as the rectouterine pouch, is a peritoneal space between the uterus and the rectum in females. It does not contain remnants of the Wolffian ducts. The uterovesical pouch (Option C) , also known as the vesicouterine pouch, is a peritoneal space between the bladder and the uterus in females. It does not contain remnants of the Wolffian ducts. The iliac fossa (Option D) is a broad, concave surface on the inner surface of the ilium bone of the pelvis. It does not contain remnants of the Wolffian ducts. Reference: William's Gynaecology, 4th Edition, Page 108",

        "A": "Ampulla",
        "B": "Isthmus",
        "C": "Interstitial segment",
        "D": "Infundibulum"
      },
      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: A) Ampulla Explanation: Out of the nearly half a billion sperm deposited in the vagina, only a few thousand successfully make it to each ampulla. Fertilization typically occurs in the ampulla (Option A) of one of the fallopian tubes shortly after both the sperm and the ovum arrive there. Incorrect Options: The isthmus (Option B) is the narrower and proximal part of the fallopian tube, closer to the uterus. While the isthmus serves as a passageway for the fertilized embryo to reach the uterine cavity, fertilization does not usually occur in this region. The interstitial segment (Option C) , also known as the intramural segment, refers to the small portion of the fallopian tube that traverses the uterine wall. Fertilization does not occur in this segment of the fallopian tube. The infundibulum (Option D) is the funnel-shaped opening of the fallopian tube located near the ovary. It has finger-like projections called fimbriae that help capture the released oocyte from the ovary. While the infundibulum plays a role in capturing the oocyte, fertilization itself typically occurs in the ampulla rather than the infundibulum.

        "A": "Rectouterine pouch",
        "B": "Ovarian fossa",
        "C": "Posterior fornix",
        "D": "Vesicouterine pouch"
      },
      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: A) Rectouterine pouch Explanation: The rectouterine pouch, also known as the pouch of Douglas, is considered th e most dependent part of the female peritoneal cavity. It is located between the posterior surface of the uterus and the anterior surface of the rectum. In a standing position, this area is the lowest point of the peritoneal cavity, making it the most reliant part in terms of fluid accumulation and drainage. Incorrect Options: The ovarian fossa (Option B) is a shallow depression on the peritoneal surface located on the lateral pelvic wall. It lies behind the lateral attachment of the broad ligament and houses the ovary in nulliparous women. While important anatomically, it is not the most reliant part of the body. The posterior fornix (Option C) is the recess behind the cervix, where the vagina meets the cervix. It is an important anatomical feature but is not the most dependent part of the female reproductive system. The vesicouterine pouch (Option D) is formed by the anterior reflection of the peritoneum over the fundus and body of the uterus, covering the posterior surface of the bladder. While it plays a role in the anatomy of the female pelvis, it is not the most reliant or dependent part compared to the rectouterine pouch. Reference: William’s Gynecology, 4th edition, Page: 807.",
