      },
      "correct_answer": "D",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: D) Increase GnRH release Explanation: Oral contraceptives, particularly combination hormonal contraceptives (CHCs), work through the following mechanisms: Inhibition of Ovulation (Option C): The estrogen and progestin components suppress gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) secretion from the hypothalamus. This leads to reduced release of follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) and luteinizing hormone (LH) by the pituitary, preventing ovulation. Thickening of Cervical Mucus (Option B) : Progestin increases the viscosity of cervical mucus, creating a barrier that impedes sperm entry into the uterus. Endometrial Alteration: Hormonal changes modify the uterine lining, making it unsuitable for implantation (Option A) . An increase in GnRH release would stimulate the pituitary to produce FSH and LH, promoting ovulation rather than suppressing it. Since this contradicts the mechanism of action of oral contraceptives, Option D is correct as it does not align with their effects. Reference: Williams Obstetrics, 26th Edition, Page 671",

      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: A) Hysteroscopic Explanation: The contraceptive device depicted in the image is the Essure coil, a permanent sterilization method. It is inserted hysteroscopically, which involves the use of a hysteroscope through the vagina into the uterus. The device is then placed into each fallopian tube to create a physical barrier, causing fibrosis and occlusion of the tubes over time. Essure It is a permanent, non-surgical form of sterilization that involves placing small coils into the fallopian tubes to prevent pregnancy. Procedure: The procedure involves the insertion of small, flexible coils (made of stainless steel and polyester fibers) into the fallopian tubes through the cervix and uterus. This is done under local anesthesia. Mechanism: Over a few months, the body forms scar tissue around the coils, which blocks the fallopian tubes, preventing sperm from reaching the eggs. Indications: Permanent contraception for women who are sure they do not want future pregnancies. Suitable for women who are not planning to undergo traditional tubal ligation or who have contraindications for surgery. Advantages: Non-surgical Quick recovery: Most women can resume normal activities within a day or two. Performed under local anesthesia. Permanent Effectiveness: After about three months, a hysterosalpingogram (HSG) is performed to confirm tube blockage. Complications: Side effects: Mild cramping, bleeding, or infection after the procedure. Rare complications: Expulsion or migration of the coils, perforation of the uterus or fallopian tubes.

      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: B) Follow-up after 1-2 cycles of OCPs Explanation: The correct approach for a functional ovarian cyst that is asymptomatic, unilocular, less than 7 cm, and with negative serology, is conservative management. Follow-up after 1-2 cycles of oral contraceptive pills (OCPs) helps suppress ovarian function and promotes cyst resolution. Most functional cysts resolve spontaneously without the need for surgical intervention. Incorrect Options: Laparotomy (Option A) is not indicated for a simple 6 cm functional cyst. It is reserved for larger cysts (>7 cm), persistent cysts, or those with suspicious features. Ovariotomy (Option C) involves the removal of the ovary and is not necessary for functional cysts. It is reserved for cases of ovarian torsion, malignancy, or complicated cysts. CA-125 testing (Option D) is used to monitor ovarian cancer or evaluate complex adnexal masses. It is not applicable for a benign, functional ovarian cyst in an asymptomatic patient.

        "D": "Desogestrel 3 mg"
      },
      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: C) Levonorgestrel 1.5 mg Explanation: Levonorgestrel 1.5 mg is the most appropriate option for emergency contraception in this case. It is a progestin-only pill and is highly effective when taken within 72 hours after unprotected intercourse. Since the patient prefers a single-pill regimen, this option is ideal. It does not contain estrogen, avoiding estrogen-related side effects such as nausea or vomiting. Emergency Contraceptive Methods Method Drug(s) Dosage Schedule Time Period for Use Oral Contraceptive Pills Levonorgestrel 1.5 mg (single dose) 1 dose Within 72 hours after unprotected sex Combination Pills (Yuzpe Regimen) Levonorgestrel + Ethinyl estradiol Levonorgestrel 0.75 mg + Ethinyl estradiol 0.1 mg per tablet 2 doses, 12 hours apart Within 72 hours after unprotected sex Levonorgestrel Levonorgestrel 0.75 mg per tablet (take 2 tablets) 1 dose Within 72 hours after unprotected sex Ulipristal Acetate Ulipristal acetate 30 mg (single dose) 1 dose Within 120 hours (5 days) after unprotected sex Copper IUD (Best) Copper IUD N/A (inserted by healthcare provider) Insertion by a healthcare provider Within 5 days after unprotected sex Mifepristone (Less Common) Mifepristone (in combination with misoprostol) 200 mg (single dose) 1 dose Within 72 hours after unprotected sex Incorrect Options: While levonorgestrel 0.75 mg (Option A) is used in some regimens, it requires two doses (one pill initially and another 12 hours later). Since the patient prefers a single pill, this option is not suitable. Ethinyl estradiol + levonorgestrel (Option B) combination contains both estrogen (ethinyl estradiol) and progestin (levonorgestrel). While effective, the estrogen component increases the risk of side effects, including nausea and vomiting, which the patient is trying to avoid. Desogestrel 3 mg (Option D) is a progestin-only contraceptive, but it is not typically used for emergency contraception. Furthermore, it is often combined with estrogen, which would introduce unnecessary side effects. Reference: Williams Gyanecology, 4th Edition, Page: 131.",

      },
      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: A) For tubal ligation Explanation: The Falope ring involves using a specialized applicator to place a Silastic ring around the midisthmic portion of the tube, leading to ischemic necrosis over time. Care must be taken to avoid laceration of the tube during application. The Hulka and Filshie clips are applied across the mid-isthmus of the tube. Proper placement of the clips is crucial to ensure complete occlusion of the tube. The falope ring applicator is not used for ligation of the uterine artery during hysterectomy (Option B). Hysterectomy involves the removal of the uterus and may or may not involve ligation of the uterine arteries, but the falope ring applicator is not used for this purpose. An ovarian cystectomy (Option C) is a surgical procedure to remove ovarian cysts while preserving healthy ovarian tissue. The falope ring applicator is not used for ovarian cystectomy, as it is unrelated to this procedure. An ectopic pregnancy (Option D) occurs when a fertilized egg implants outside the uterus, usually in the fallopian tube. The treatment for ectopic pregnancy typically involves surgical intervention, but the falope ring applicator is not used for this purpose.

      "explanation": "Correct Answer: A) Danazol Explanation: Emergency contraception, also known as post-coital contraception or the \"morning-after pill,\" is used to prevent pregnancy after unprotected intercourse or contraceptive failure. Danazol is not used for emergency contraception. It is a medication primarily indicated for the treatment of endometriosis and certain hormone-related conditions. It does not prevent pregnancy. CuT200 (Option B) refers to a copper intrauterine device (IUD) that can be used as emergency contraception. When inserted within a specific timeframe after unprotected intercourse, the copper IUD can prevent pregnancy. It is an effective and long-acting form of emergency contraception. RU486 (Option C), also known as mifepristone or the \" abortion pill ,\" is not a method used for post-coital contraception. It is a medication used for medical abortion or termination of an established pregnancy. It works by blocking the action of progesterone , which is necessary to maintain pregnancy. Combined high-dose estrogen-progestin pills (Option D) have been used as emergency contraception in the past but are no longer recommended due to their potential side effects. They are less effective and have more significant adverse effects compared to other available emergency contraception options, such as dedicated emergency contraceptive pills or the copper IUD.

      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: B) Tubectomy (Female Sterilization) Explanation: There are five primary methods of female sterilization: Tubal sterilization during laparotomy for cesarean delivery or other abdominal surgeries. Postpartum mini-laparotomy immediately after vaginal delivery. Interval minilaparotomy. Laparoscopy. Hysteroscopy. Surgical Technique The Pomeroy technique , or a modified version of it, is typically chosen for tubal sterilization during laparotomy. In the classic Pomeroy method, a loop of the fallopian tube is excised, and the base of the loop is ligated with a single absorbable suture. The Madlener technique , which is no longer used due to high failure rates, involved crushing a loop of the tube , ligating it with a permanent suture, and excising the segment. Failure rates for the Pomeroy and partial salpingectomy procedures are low In contrast, pregnancy after sterilization using the Irving or Uchida methods is exceedingly rare . The Irving method involves excising the midsection of the tube, and then turning back the proximal stump and suturing it into a small stab wound in the uterine wall, forming a blind loop. The Uchida method involves injecting a saline–epinephrine solution beneath the mucosa of the tube , separating the mucosa from the underlying tissue. The mucosa is then incised, and a segment of the tube is excised. The mucosa is sutured closed, burying the proximal stump and separating it from the distal end. Laparoscopy Laparoscopy is the most commonly used method for interval sterilization. During the procedure, the abdomen is inflated with gas, and a laparoscope is inserted through a trocar at the lower edge of the umbilicus. Although single-puncture laparoscopic sterilization can be done using an operating laparoscope, a second, and sometimes third, trocar is often inserted in the lower quadrants or suprapubic area to facilitate the use of special grasping forceps. Laparoscopic sterilization is typically performed in a hospital under general anesthesia, though local anesthesia with conscious sedation can also be used. Most patients do not require overnight hospitalization after the procedure. Incorrect Options: A punch biopsy (Option A) is a procedure to obtain a small sample of tissue for examination. The instrument used in a punch biopsy is typically a circular blade or punch, which is different from the instrument depicted. A bone marrow biopsy set (Option C) is used to obtain a sample of bone marrow for diagnostic purposes. It typically includes a needle and a syringe, and the instrument depicted does not resemble the components of a bone marrow biopsy set. The instrument depicted does not resemble a trocar and cannula used in laparoscopy (Option D) , which typically consists of a sharp-pointed instrument and a hollow tube for accessing the abdominal cavity.",

It is effective for up to 10 years and is reversible as it can be removed at any time, and fertility generally returns quickly after removal. Implanon (Option B) is a subdermal implant that provides contraception for up to 3 years. It is a reversible method, as fertility typically returns within 1 month of removal. Combined oral contraceptive pills (Option D) contain a mixture of estrogen (ethinylestradiol) and progestogen. They are a reversible method of contraception, with 90% of women returning to normal ovulatory cycles within 3 months after discontinuing the pills.

      "correct_answer": "D",
      "explanation": "Correct answer: D) Levonorgestrel 1.5 mg Explanation: Levonorgestrel 1.5 mg is an emergency contraception used in India. Emergency Contraceptives (EC): Prevents unintended pregnancy after unprotected or inadequately protected intercourse. It includes both emergency contraceptive pills (ECPs) and the insertion of an intrauterine device (IUD): Emergency Contraceptive Pills (ECPs): Levonorgestrel (LNG): Available as a single 1.5 mg pill. Most effective within 72 hours but can be used up to 120 hours. Commonly available in India. Ulipristal Acetate (UPA): (Option C) Single-dose pill containing 30 mg of ulipristal acetate. Effective for up to 120 hours (5 days) post-intercourse. Approved by US-FDA and European medicine agencies. Not available in India. Combined Hormonal Regimens (Yuzpe Method): Involves taking 2 doses, 12 hours apart. Each dose contains at least 100 micrograms of ethinyl estradiol and 500 micrograms of levonorgestrel. Intrauterine Device (IUD): Copper IUD: Most effective form of EC. It can be inserted within 5 days of unprotected intercourse. Misoprostol 400 mcg (Option A): Misoprostol, a prostaglandin E1 (PGE1) analogue, is commonly used in combination with mifepristone for medical termination of pregnancy (MTP). It induces uterine contractions to facilitate abortion and is not classified as an emergency contraceptive. Ethinyl estradiol 600 mcg (Option B): High-dose ethinyl estradiol (EE) combined with levonorgestrel is used in the Yuzpe regimen for emergency contraception; EE alone at this dose does not function as an emergency contraceptive.

      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: B) Sterility is achieved 3 weeks after the procedure Explanation: Sterility post-vasectomy is achieved by 3 months (12 weeks), not 3 weeks. Vasectomy is a safe, minimally invasive, and highly effective method of male sterilization. The procedure is performed under local anesthesia to minimize discomfort. (Option A ruled out) The no-scalpel technique , which involves a small puncture instead of a traditional incision, is now widely used and associated with fewer complications. (Option C ruled out) The vas deferens , the tube responsible for transporting sperm, is divided during the procedure. (Option D ruled out) Sperm present in the post-distal ligation area can lead to pregnancy, hence contraception is required for 3 months or 20 ejaculations , whichever is later. Sterilization is confirmed by semen analysis , with at least 2 analyses showing azoospermia. Studies show that 80% of men are sterile after 15 ejaculations or about 6 weeks , and 89% are sperm-free by 10 weeks . The remaining sperm is gradually cleared, making the safe time period approximately 3 months . Reference: Williams Textbook of Gynecology, 4th Edition, Page 120",

      },
      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: C) Female sterilization Explanation: Female sterilization is an irreversible method of contraception. It involves surgical procedures like tubal ligation, where the fallopian tubes are either severed, destroyed, or blocked, preventing the eggs from reaching the uterus. This method is permanent and cannot be reversed, making it distinct from other long-term reversible methods. Progestin injections (Option A) , like NET-EN, are a form of reversible contraception. These injections prevent pregnancy for a few months and are easily reversible once discontinued. Progestin implants (e.g., Nexplanon) (Option B) are small rods placed under the skin that release a hormone to prevent pregnancy. They are highly effective, reversible, and can last for several years. Both levonorgestrel-releasing (e.g., Mirena) (Option D) and copper-containing (e.g., CuT-380A) intrauterine devices (IUDs) are long-term, reversible contraceptive methods. They can remain in place for several years and are removed if pregnancy is desired. Reference: Williams Gynaecology, 4th Edition, Page: 114-118",

      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: C) Protection against sexually transmitted diseases, including HIV Explanation: Oral contraceptives (OCPs) provide numerous non-contraceptive benefits. However, they do not prevent sexually transmitted diseases (STDs), including HIV. Barrier methods, such as condoms, are necessary for protection against STDs. Mechanism of Action of OCPs Combined Oral Contraceptives (COCPs): Contain ethinylestradiol and progestins. Suppress ovulation: Inhibit FSH and LH release from the pituitary. Cervical mucus thickening: Progesterone prevents sperm penetration. Progestin-Only Pills (Mini-pills): Act primarily by altering cervical mucus and endometrial environment. Hormonal Content Primary Mechanism Secondary Effects Estrogen Suppresses FSH Stabilizes endometrium, reduces bleeding Progestin Suppresses LH Thickens cervical mucus, thins endometrium Non-Contraceptive Benefits of OCPs Reduction in ovarian cancer risk (Option A) Suppresses ovulation, reducing exposure to gonadotropins that may induce ovarian epithelial damage. Reduction in endometrial cancer risk (Option B) Progestin opposes estrogen's proliferative effects on the endometrium. Reduction in ectopic pregnancy (Option D) Suppresses ovulation and reduces pelvic inflammatory disease (PID). Management of PCOD Regularizes menstrual cycles and reduces androgen levels. Improvement in acne Reduces androgen levels, decreasing sebaceous gland activity. Menorrhagia and dysmenorrhea Reduces endometrial proliferation and menstrual blood loss.

Longer induction duration is rarely used. Surgical Methods of MTP: Trimester Procedure Description Image 1st Manual Vacuum Aspiration (MVA) MVA is an outpatient surgical abortion procedure used up to 12 weeks of gestation. The procedure involves dilating the cervix and inserting a cannula attached to a manual vacuum aspirator or a 60-mL syringe. The cannula is used to remove retained tissue from the uterus. The approximate pressure is around - 610 mmHg. Electric Vacuum Aspiration (EVA) EVA is similar to MVA. Instead of a manual syringe, it uses an electric pump to generate suction to remove retained products of conception. Dilation and Curettage (D&C) D&C is performed up to 12 weeks of gestation by dilating the cervix and using instruments like curettes and suction cannula. MVA and EVA are preferred over sharp D&C for being safer and more efficient. Karman’s cannula Hegar’s dilator Uterine curette 2nd Dilation and Evacuation (D&E) D&E is a 2nd-trimester abortion method involving cervical dilation using osmotic dilators. Ovum forceps are then used to remove the pregnancy tissue. Draining amniotic fluid before removing the fetus is crucial to minimize the risk of amniotic fluid embolism during the procedure. Ovum forceps Hysterotomy A hysterotomy is a surgical procedure where the uterus is incised to remove the fetus. Reserved for 2nd-trimester abortions where other methods are not feasible or have failed.",
