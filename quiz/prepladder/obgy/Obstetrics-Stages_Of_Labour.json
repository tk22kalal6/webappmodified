      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Correct answer: C) Sinusoidal pattern, describing a smooth, regular fetal heart rate oscillation associated with severe fetal anaemia or maternal opioid use Explanation: A sin usoidal pattern in a cardiotocography (CTG) trace resembles a sine wave, with a stable fetal heart rate (FHR) and fixed or absent baseline variability lasting more than 30 minutes. Accelerations are absent in a true sinusoidal pattern. This pattern is often associated with: Fetal anaemia Fetomaternal haemorrhage Vasa Previa Fetal hypoxia (acidosis) A sinusoidal pattern can also occur when the mother has been given narcotics. The pseudo sinusoidal pattern shows a 'saw-toothed' pattern. It differs from the true sinusoidal pattern because it indicates a well-oxygenated fetus.

      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Correct answer: C) Fetal head compression Explanation: Early decelerations, characterised by a gradual decrease in fetal heart rate that mirrors contractions, are primarily linked to fetal head compression. This is usually benign and occurs during active labour as the fetal head descends into the pelvis. Interpretation of CTG : Baseline FHR: Average FHR between contractions (110-160 bpm). Abnormal ranges indicate fetal distress. Baseline Variability: Fluctuations in baseline FHR reflect nervous system balance. Reduced variability may indicate hypoxia, acidosis, or other factors. Accelerations: Transient FHR increases with fetal movement, indicating a healthy fetus with intact neurohormonal and cardiovascular function. Decelerations: Transient FHR decreases below baseline.

      "question": "A 32-week pregnant woman with gestational hypertension presents during a routine prenatal visit with elevated blood pressure. Ultrasound shows normal fetal growth, but there is concern about fetal well-being due to maternal hypertension. What is the most appropriate next step to monitor fetal status?",
      "options": {

        "D": "Non-stress test (NST)"
      },
      "correct_answer": "D",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: D) Non-stress test (NST) Explanation: Gestational hypertension qualifies as a high-risk pregnancy , even if fetal growth is currently normal. The NST is a first-line, non-invasive tool to assess fetal oxygenation and autonomic integrity by evaluating fetal heart rate accelerations in response to movement. It provides real-time information about fetal well-being, especially in hypertensive disorders. If NST is nonreactive or equivocal, it may be followed by BPP or Doppler studies as needed. High-Risk Pregnancy Fetal Surveillance Modalities Modality Description Use in High-Risk Pregnancy Maternal Perception of Movement Self-reported decrease in fetal kicks Basic screening, not sufficient alone in hypertensive cases Non-stress Test (NST) Heart rate monitoring with fetal movement First-line in hypertension, IUGR, and other high-risk cases Contraction Stress Test (CST) Heart rate response to contractions Rarely used today; backup when NST is equivocal Biophysical Profile (BPP) Combines NST + ultrasound for movement, tone, breathing, AFI Follow-up after abnormal NST or in chronic conditions Modified BPP NST + Amniotic Fluid Index (AFI) Quick screening method in high-risk pregnancy Doppler Velocimetry Blood flow in umbilical or MCA vessels Used in IUGR, anemia, or advanced hypertensive disease Cardiotocography (CTG) Continuous electronic fetal monitoring In labor or inpatient high-risk settings Real-Time Ultrasound Assess growth, fluid, and fetal anatomy Adjunct to other methods NST is recommended as the first-line surveillance tool in high-risk pregnancies like hypertension. MCA Doppler is more useful when there's evidence of fetal anemia or IUGR , not when growth is normal. Fetal echocardiogram is used when congenital cardiac defects are suspected, not for routine hypertension. Maternal movement monitoring is helpful but subjective, and not adequate for high-risk conditions alone. Fetal echocardiogram (Option A): Incorrect. It is indicated in cases with suspected cardiac anomalies (e.g., abnormal four-chamber view or maternal diabetes/lupus), not hypertension. Monitor fetal movements daily (Option B): Incorrect. While important, maternal movement counting is a subjective tool and not sufficient for surveillance in gestational hypertension. Doppler ultrasound of the middle cerebral artery (Option C): Incorrect. MCA Doppler is used in fetal anemia or IUGR , and not the initial test when fetal growth is normal.

Her pregnancy has been uncomplicated thus far. Her obstetrician decides to perform a biophysical profile (BPP) due to a recent history of decreased fetal movements. The BPP results are as follows: Fetal breathing movements: 1 episode of 30 seconds within 30 minutes Gross body movements: 3 discrete body or limb movements within 30 minutes Fetal tone: no movement Amniotic fluid volume: Single vertical pocket measuring 2 cm Non-stress test (NST): Reactive What is the recommended management for this patient?",

        "D": "Admit for continuous fetal monitoring"
      },
      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: C) Continue routine prenatal care and follow up as scheduled Explanation: The biophysical profile score: 2 (breathing) + 2 (movements) + o (tone) + 2 (amniotic fluid) + 2 (NST) = 8 points indicates that the fetus is not in distress and is well-oxygenated. Routine prenatal care is appropriate, and the patient should continue with her scheduled follow-up appointments. Biophysical Profile (BPP) is a prenatal test used to assess fetal well-being, particularly in high-risk pregnancies. It combines ultrasound imaging with the Non-Stress Test (NST) to evaluate five biophysical parameters: Fetal Breathing Movements Gross Body Movements Fetal Tone Amniotic Fluid Volume Non-Stress Test (NST) Indications: 1. High-Risk Pregnancies: Chronic maternal conditions such as hypertension, diabetes, lupus, and renal disease. History of previous stillbirth or fetal loss. Multiple gestations (twins or more), especially if growth discordance is suspected. 2. Suspected Fetal Compromise: Decreased fetal movements reported by the mother. Abnormal fetal growth patterns or intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR). Non-reassuring results from other fetal monitoring techniques (e.g., abnormal NST or Doppler studies). 3. Post-Term Pregnancies 4.

      "explanation": "Correct Answer: D)Indomethacin cannot be used to treat this condition Explanation: The clinical vignette suggests polyhydramnios, but the incorrect statement regarding this condition is that indomethacin cannot be used to treat it. Polyhydramnios is an excessive amount of amniotic fluid, often diagnosed when the AFI is >= 25 cm or the SDP is >= 8 cm. CAUSES OF POLYHYDRAMNIOS Increased fetal urine production Impaired fetal swallowing Twin/multifetal pregnancy Maternal hyperglycemia/diabetes Twin-to-twin transfusion syndrome Cleft lip and cleft palate. Esophageal atresia or stenosis. Duodenal atresia or stenosis. Bowel obstruction. Anencephaly. Placental causes Fetal causes Chorangioma of placenta. Circumvallate placenta. Hydrops fetalis. Rubella, syphilis, and toxoplasmosis. Trisomy. Sacrococcygeal teratoma. Thalassemia of the fetus. Management of polyhydramnios: Serial amniocentesis (treatment of choice): Fluid is removed at a rate of 500 mL/hr, maximum up to 1500-2000 mL). Indomethacin 1.5-3 mg/kg/day: Reduced fetal urinary output and increased fluid reabsorption via lungs. It can cause premature closure of patent ductus arteriosus; hence therapy should be stopped at 32 weeks. Reference: Williams Obstetrics, 4th Edition, Page 257, 258, 259, 260.

        "D": "Preterm labour"
      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: B) Oligohydramnios Explanation: Oligohydramnios is defined as a decreased amount of amniotic fluid. It is diagnosed when the AFI is less than 5 cm or the SDVP is less than 2 cm. In this scenario, the SDVP of 1.5 cm confirms the diagnosis of oligohydramnios. Oligohydramnios: Criteria Amniotic fluid index <5 cm. Single deepest vertical pocket <2 cm. Amniotic Fluid Volume less than 500 mL. Causes Uteroplacental insufficiency Premature rupture of membranes (PROM) Post-term pregnancy Fetal renal anomalies Maternal dehydration Medications (e.g., ACE inhibitors). Complications Umbilical cord compression Fetal growth restriction Preterm birth Stillbirth Labour complications (e.g., meconium aspiration, cesarean delivery) Diagnosis Ultrasound to measure AFI and SDVP. Non-stress test (NST) and biophysical profile (BPP) for fetal assessment. Treatment Amnioinfusion during labour for severe cases. Maternal rehydration. Delivery planning is based on gestational age and fetal status. Normal amniotic fluid volume is indicated by an AFI between 5-24 cm or a single deepest vertical pocket between 2-8 cm. The findings in this scenario fall below these ranges. Preterm labour refers to labour that occurs before 37 weeks of gestation. While the patient is at 36 weeks, there is no mention of contractions or cervical changes that would indicate preterm labour. The primary concern in this scenario is the decreased amniotic fluid volume, not labour. Reference: Williams Obstetrics, 4th Edition, Page 260,261. DC Dutta Obstetrics, 9th Edition, Page 203.",

        "C": "Contraction frequency",
        "D": "Accelerations of fetal heart rate"
      },
      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Correct answer: C) Contraction frequency Explanation: Contraction frequency is not a parameter evaluated during an NST. It is more relevant in a contraction stress test (CST) or during labor monitoring. NST specifically assesses fetal heart rate patterns without considering uterine contractions. Non-Stress Test (NST): It is a non-invasive test used to assess fetal well-being by monitoring the fetal heart rate and its response to fetal movements. It is typically performed in the third trimester of pregnancy. The mother is placed in a semi-reclining position, and two belts are placed around her abdomen to measure the fetal heart rate and detect fetal movements. Indications for NST: Post-term pregnancy. Decreased fetal movements. High-risk pregnancies (e.g., hypertension, diabetes). History of previous pregnancy complications. Suspected intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR). Primary parameters evaluated during an NST: 1. Baseline Fetal Heart Rate (FHR) 2. Beat-to-beat Variability: Normal: 110-160 bpm Bradycardia: less than 110 bpm. Tachycardia: more than 160 bpm. Fluctuations in the heart rate from one beat to the next. Amplitude range of 6-25 bpm (considered normal). 3. Accelerations Temporary increases in FHR above the baseline. Reactive NST: At least two accelerations in a 20-minute period. Each acceleration should be 15 bpm above the baseline and last for at least 15 seconds (for fetuses older than 32 weeks). Non-Reactive NST: Fewer than two accelerations in a 20-minute period. 4. Decelerations Temporary drops in FHR below the baseline. Early Decelerations: Usually benign, occurring with uterine contractions. Variable Decelerations: Can indicate umbilical cord compression. Late Decelerations: Concerning as they may indicate uteroplacental insufficiency. 5. Fetal Movements The presence and frequency of fetal movements are monitored, as decreased movements can indicate distress. Interpretation: Reactive NST: Indicative of normal fetal oxygenation and autonomic function. Non-Reactive NST may require further testing, such as a Biophysical Profile (BPP) or Contraction Stress Test (CST). Reference: Williams Obstetrics, 4th Edition, Page 386, 387, 388, 389.

It has a half-life of 3-5 minutes and is stored at 2-8 I . Uses: First-line uterotonic agent. Induction and augmentation of labour. It is responsible for milk ejection. Oxytocin should not be given as an IV bolus due to the risk of marked transient fall in BP, an abrupt increase in cardiac output, and cardiovascular collapse. Due to its ADH-like action, it can cause water intoxication, leading to hyponatremia, seizures, and coma. Other agents used: Uterotonic Agent Route Uses Contraindications Ergometrine (0.25 mg) Methylergometrine (0.2 mg) IM Used if oxytocin is unavailable. It cannot be used for induction or augmentation (cause tetanic contractions) Twin pregnancy Organic heart disease Preeclampsia and eclampsia. Rh (-ve) female.

      "explanation": "Correct Answer : C) Uterine massage Explanation: Uterine massage is no longer a part of active management of third stage of labour as per latest WHO guidelines. Steps of AMTSL: Use of uterotonic (oxytocin) after the birth of the baby (5-10 IU IM at delivery of the anterior shoulder). Delayed cord clamping ( ≥ 1-3 minutes). Wait for 60 seconds. Increases the Hb of the baby by 1g% (preventing neonatal anemia). Contraindicated in: Fetal distress HIV/HbsAg positive mother Rh-negative mother Delivery of the placenta by controlled cord traction (Modified Brandt Andrews method). Intermittent assessment of uterine tone. Advantages of AMTSL Minimised Blood Loss Shortened Duration Disadvantages Slightly increased incidence of retained placenta Risk of asphyxia in the second twin if administered prematurely. Indications High-risk factors include anaemia, hydroamnios, twins, grand multiparae, and a previous history of postpartum haemorrhage (PPH).

      "question": "A 28-year-old woman presents to the emergency department 24 hours after a vaginal delivery with complaints of severe perineal pain and difficulty with bowel movements. Upon examination, a third-degree perineal tear is diagnosed. What is the not done as next step in management?",
      "options": {
        "A": "Immediate repair of the tear",
        "B": "Initiate broad-spectrum antibiotics",
        "C": "Provide pain management & wound care",
        "D": "Plan for delayed repair"
      },
      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: A) immediate repair of the tear Explanation: For third-degree perineal tears presenting more than 24 hours after delivery, immediate repair is typically not recommended due to the increased risk of infection. The appropriate management involves starting broad-spectrum antibiotics to prevent infection and planning for surgical repair after a three-month period. Management : Immediate Repair: After placenta delivery to reduce infection risk and blood loss. Delayed Repair: If >24 hours, start antibiotics and wound care & plan for delayed repair (secondary repair) once the wound if free of exudate and infection. Procedure : The steps for repairing a complete perineal tear: 1 Positioning Lithotomy position, clean the area. 2 Anaesthesia Local infiltration with lignocaine, pudendal block, or regional/general anaesthesia. 3 Suturing steps Start with rectal and anal mucosa using No. 3-0 vicryl or PDS, interrupted sutures with knots inside. Suture rectal muscles and pararectal fascia with interrupted sutures using the same material. Reconstruct sphincter ani externus (EAS) with figure-of-eight stitch, support with additional interrupted sutures. Repair perineal muscles with interrupted No. 0 PDS or similar, and bury knots under superficial muscles. Close the vaginal wall and perineal skin with interrupted sutures. 4 Suture materials External anal sphincter: PDS or vicryl. Internal anal sphincter: Finer sutures like 3-0 PDS. 5 After care Similar to post-episiotomy care. Specific care for complete tear repairs: Low-residue diet post-repair. Lactulose to soften stools. Broad-spectrum antibiotics. Pelvic floor exercises. Follow-up at 6-12 weeks postpartum. Further consultations for persistent incontinence. 6 Future Pregnancies Institutional Delivery: Recommended for all women post-repair. Vaginal Delivery: May be considered with or without an episiotomy. Elective Caesarean: Recommended for women with symptoms or abnormal findings on endoanal ultrasound or anorectal manometry.

      },
      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "Correct answer: A) Absorbable sutures are used in the perineal muscle layer Explanation: Absorbable sutures like polyglycolic acid (dexon) or chromic catgut suture the perineal muscle layer during episiotomy repair. Episiotomy repair: Timing: Done soon after the expulsion of the placenta to prevent wound disruption and reduce the risk of infection (sepsis). Early repair also helps alleviate patient discomfort and anxiety about sutures. Principles to be Followed: Perfect Hemostasis: Ensure bleeding is controlled completely before proceeding with each layer of suturing. Obliterate Dead Space: Close the wound layers tightly to prevent the formation of pockets where fluid can accumulate. Suture Without Tension: Avoid pulling the tissues too tightly together, as this can lead to poor wound healing and cosmetic outcomes. Order of repair: Vaginal mucosa and submucosa Perineal muscles Skin and subcutaneous tissue Layer Description Vaginal Mucosa and Submucosal Tissues Sutured starting at or above the apex of the tear. Interrupted sutures with Polyglycolic acid (Dexon) or No. '0' Chromic Catgut. Perineal Muscles Absorbable sutures like Polyglycolic acid (Dexon) or Chromic Catgut.

Types of episiotomy: Type Advantages Disadvantages Mediolateral Reduced risk of severe perineal tears. May facilitate easier delivery. Less risk of injury to the anal sphincter compared to the midline. Higher risk of postpartum pain and discomfort. Potential for increased blood loss compared to other types. It may not be suitable for all cases, depending on perineal anatomy. Median Simplicity in execution. Reduced risk of injury to the anal sphincter. Less postoperative pain compared to mediolateral. Higher risk of severe perineal tears, including anal sphincter injury. Potential for increased healing time and complications due to midline orientation. Lateral/ Transverse Potential for reducing the risk of severe perineal tears compared to midline. Less disruption to perineal body alignment. May be quicker to perform in some cases. Higher risk of complications such as Bartholin's duct injury. Increased likelihood of uneven wound healing. Not preferred due to the potential for structural damage and poor cosmetic outcomes. T-shaped Potential for minimising anal sphincter injury. May provide better vaginal opening in complex deliveries. Less risk of perineal tear extension. Complex to perform. Likely to cause puckering and imperfect wound closure. Not widely recommended due to the potential for postoperative complications and difficult repair. Steps of mediolateral episiotomy:",
