      "explanation": "Correct Answer: B) Adenomyosis Explanation: Adenomyosis is characterized by the invasion of endometrial tissue into the myometrium (muscle layer of the uterus). This condition leads to a uniformly enlarged and tender uterus and can present with symptoms such as pelvic discomfort, heavy menstrual bleeding, and dysmenorrhea. The presence of a myometrial cyst seen on MRI is a hallmark finding in adenomyosis, making it the most likely diagnosis in this case. Adenomyosis Definition Presence of endometrial glands and stroma within the myometrium, leading to uterine enlargement. Epidemiology Common in parous women over 40 years of age. Clinical Features Abnormal uterine bleeding (AUB). Chronic pelvic pain. Globally enlarged and globular uterus (if diffuse). Investigations Primary Investigation: TVS with Color Doppler. Key Signs on USG: Shutter/Venetian Blind sign (echogenic striations). Central vascularity on Doppler. Diagnostic Criteria: Asymmetrical uterine wall thickness (posterior > anterior). Heterogeneous myometrial echotexture. Hypoechoic myometrial cysts (honeycomb appearance). Striated projections from endometrium to myometrium. Poorly defined endometrial echo. J-Zone thickening â‰¥ 12 mm. Secondary Investigation: MRI (if USG is i nconclusive). Thickened junctional zone (>12 mm). High-intensity myometrial foci on T2-weighted images. Histopathology Myometrial infiltration by endometrial glands and stroma. Medical Management Combined OCPs and progestin-only regimens (for dysmenorrhea and menorrhagia). NSAIDs (for pain and menorrhagia). LNG-IUS (for menorrhagia). GnRH agonists (for subfertility or pre-surgical symptom relief). Danazol (for menorrhagia and pain). Surgical Management Conservative: Adenomyomectomy (risk of recurrence). Uterine mass reduction (laparotomy/laparoscopy). Uterine artery embolization (UAE). Definitive: Total hysterectomy. Endometriosis (Option A) refers to the growth of endometrial tissue outside the uterus, often leading to symptoms like pelvic pain, dyspareunia, and infertility. While it can coexist with adenomyosis, the myometrial cyst described in this scenario is more characteristic of adenomyosis. Leiomyoma (Option C) , or fibroids, are benign tumors of the uterine smooth muscle. They typically present as localized masses within the uterus, leading to an irregularly enlarged uterus rather than a uniformly enlarged one. The presence of a myometrial cyst is not commonly associated with fibroids. Endometrial hyperplasia (Option D) involves excessive thickening of the endometrial lining due to hormonal imbalance, often leading to abnormal uterine bleeding. It does not cause a uniformly",
