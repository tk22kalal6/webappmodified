Actinomyces can form biofilms, protecting bacteria from immune responses and antibiotics. The presence of an IUD can disrupt the normal vaginal flora, potentially allowing pathogenic bacteria like Actinomyces to thrive. Reference: Dc Dutta Gynaecology ed-8,pg:119. Actinomyces -PID",

      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: B) Tubercular Pelvic Inflammatory Disease Explanation: The patient's history of low-grade fever, weight loss, and night sweats, combined with chronic pelvic pain and irregular menstrual periods, is suggestive of a chronic infectious process, specifically tuberculosis. The pelvic ultrasound findings of a complex adnexal mass with ascites, along with the laboratory results of mild anaemia and elevated ESR, support a diagnosis of tubercular PID. Clinical features of tubercular pelvic inflammatory disease: Category Symptoms and regards General Symptoms Fatigue, mild fever, loss of appetite, anaemia, night sweats, anorexia Infertility Common, affecting 70–80% of women Caused by tubal damage, endometrial destruction, ovarian dysfunction Menstrual Abnormalities 50% have normal menstruation Others may experience menorrhagia or irregular bleeding/Amenorrhea or oligomenorrhea Chronic Pelvic Pain Occurs in 20–30% of cases Often linked with tubo-ovarian mass May worsen with tubal patency test or secondary infections Vaginal Discharge Common in cervical or vaginal TB cases This may include postcoital bleeding Physical Examination Findings Often insignificant (50% show no pelvic pathology) General health may appear normal, but signs of extragenital TB (lungs, lymph nodes) may be present Abdominal examination: Normal or tender, irregular pelvic mass, abdominal distension, rare ascites Vaginal examination: Ulcers on vulva/vagina, thickened fallopian tubes, Nodules through posterior fornix, Bilateral pelvic masses Rectal examination: Confirms vaginal findings, assesses uterosacral ligament involvement Endometriosis (Option C) can cause chronic pelvic pain and irregular menstrual periods, but it usually does not cause systemic symptoms such as fever, weight loss, and night sweats. A complex adnexal mass with ascites and elevated ESR is not typical for endometriosis, suggesting that tubercular PID is more likely. Chronic pelvic pain syndrome (Option D) is a diagnosis of exclusion and is characterized by chronic pelvic pain without an identifiable infectious or structural cause. The systemic symptoms of fever, weight loss, night sweats, ultrasound findings, and elevated ESR indicate an underlying infectious or inflammatory process, making tubercular PID the more likely diagnosis.",

Intravenous cefoxitin provides broad-spectrum coverage against many pathogens, including anaerobes, while doxycycline covers Chlamydia trachomatis and other possible co-infections. In-patient antibiotic therapy Parenteral regimen A Cefoxitin 2 g IV every 6 hours for 7 days + Doxycycline 100 mg PO BD for 14 days Parenteral regimen B Clindamycin 900 mg IV every 8 hours + Gentamicin 2 mg/kg IV (loading dose), followed by 1.5 mg/kg IV (maintenance dose) every 8 hours • Aztreonam (2 g IV slowly) is similar to aminoglycoside and can be used. It has no renal toxicity, but is more expensive. Alternative parenteral regimen Ampicillin-sulbactam 3 g IV every 6 hours 3-5 days + Doxycycline 100 mg orally BID for 14 days Oral Doxycycline 100 mg BD and Metronidazole 500 mg BD (Option A) is not appropriate for severe PID with complications such as tubo-ovarian abscess. Oral medications are typically reserved for less severe cases or for continuation therapy after an initial response to intravenous treatment. Severe cases and those with complications require more intensive therapy. I.M Ceftriaxone 250 mg OD and oral Azithromycin 1 g OD (Option B) is used for the outpatient treatment of uncomplicated PID; it is not suitable for severe cases with complications such as tubo-ovarian abscess. Oral Levofloxacin 500 mg OD and Metronidazole 500 mg BD (Option D) is not suitable for severe PID with complications.

Cefixime covers Neisseria gonorrhoeae, an important pathogen associated with PID. Doxycycline covers Chlamydia trachomatis and other intracellular organisms. Metronidazole targets anaerobes, often found in the pelvis polymicrobial infections. In India the above drugs come in a Yellow kit for syndromic case management of STD. Due to its comprehensive coverage, this combination is considered first-line therapy for PID outpatient management. Male sexual partners should also be treated to prevent reinfection. In India, the Grey kit (Cefixime + Azithromycin) is used to treat partners for STIs. Out-patient antibiotic therapy Ceftriaxone 250 mg IM single dose or Cefoxitin, 2g IM single dose and probenecid, 1 g PO single dose or Injection Cefotaxime IV Add Doxycycline 100 mg PO, BD for 14 days with or without Metronidazole 500 mg PO BD for 14 days Other options: Option A Azithromycin is effective against Chlamydia trachomatis. Azithromycin does not cover other pathogens, such as Neisseria gonorrhoeae and anaerobes. Metronidazole targets anaerobic organisms, but this combination lacks coverage for Neisseria gonorrhoeae, making it suboptimal. Option C Levofloxacin is effective against organisms causing PID, such as Neisseria gonorrhoeae and anaerobes. However, it is generally reserved as an alternative therapy when other first-line antibiotics cannot be used. While Levofloxacin could be used as a first-line therapy, it is not recommended due to antibiotic resistance as it is used as a second line treatment for tuberculosis Option D Amoxicillin-clavulanate is broad-spectrum and effective against many bacterial infections. It does not adequately cover Neisseria gonorrhoeae. Doxycycline covers Chlamydia trachomatis but not the polymicrobial nature of PID. Therefore, this combination is suboptimal for treating PID according to current guidelines. Reference: Williams Gynaecology (4th Edition), page 70,71,72 DC Dutta Gynaecology (8th Edition) Page 110.",

      },
      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Correct answer: C) Endocervical swab culture Explanation : An endocervical swab is crucial for guiding treatment in patients with suspected pelvic inflammatory disease (PID). It is the most appropriate next step as it detects key sexually transmitted pathogens, such as Chlamydia trachomatis and Neisseria gonorrhoeae, which are common causes of PID. Identifying the causative organism allows for accurate diagnosis and facilitates targeted antibiotic therapy, improving patient outcomes and minimizing the risk of complications. Laparoscopy ( Option B ) is the gold standard for diagnosing pelvic inflammatory disease (PID) but usually not performed to diagnose acute PID. It allows direct visualization of the pelvic organs and the extent of inflammation, adhesions, and abscesses. It is particularly useful in uncertain cases or in patients who do not respond to initial treatment. Pelvic ultrasound ( Option A ) can help assess the pelvic organs and show PID complications, such as abscess formation. However, it is not considered the gold standard for diagnosing PID as it may not detect all cases and lacks specificity. Transvaginal ultrasound ( Option D ) provides detailed images of the pelvic organs and helps evaluate complications like tubo-ovarian abscesses. However, like pelvic ultrasound, it is not the gold standard for PID diagnosis because it may miss early or subtle signs of the disease. Reference: Williams Gynaecology, 4th Edition page 69,70",

      },
      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Correct answer: C) Pelvic Inflammatory Disease Explanation: PID is the correct diagnosis, given the symptoms of severe lower abdominal pain, fever, abnormal vaginal discharge, and pain during urination (dysuria). The presence of cervical motion tenderness and ultrasound findings of thickened, fluid-filled fallopian tubes strongly support this diagnosis. Clinical Features of PID: Signs Fever Purulent Cervical Discharge Triad of PID: Cervical motion tenderness + Adnexal tenderness + Abdominal tenderness Symptoms Lower Abdominal Pain Abnormal Vaginal Discharge Dyspareunia (Pain during intercourse) Dysuria (Pain during urination) Menstrual Irregularities Nausea and Vomiting Laboratory Findings Elevated WBC Elevated C-Reactive Protein (CRP) Elevated ESR Ultrasound Findings: Shows thickened, fluid-filled fallopian tubes and free pelvic fluid. Cervicitis (Option A) can cause vaginal discharge and discomfort, but it usually lacks the systemic symptoms of fever and significant lower abdominal pain seen in this case. Cervicitis primarily involves localized inflammation of the cervix and does not affect the fallopian tube Appendicitis (Option B) presents with lower abdominal pain, starting around the umbilical and later radiating to the right lower quadrant. Fever and elevated white blood cell count are common. However, it usually lacks vaginal discharge, cervical motion tenderness, and does not present with pain during intercourse or urination. Ovarian torsion (Option D) typically presents with a sudden onset of severe unilateral lower abdominal pain, often accompanied by nausea and vomiting. An adnexal mass may be shown on the ultrasound. However, it is less likely to present with fever, elevated white blood cell count, or abnormal vaginal discharge. Reference: Williams Gynaecology 4th Edition page 69.",
