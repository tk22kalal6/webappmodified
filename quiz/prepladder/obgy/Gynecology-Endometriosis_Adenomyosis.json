      "question": "A 40 year old woman with three children who has been using OCPs for 5 years is a current smoker, has a BMI of 27, menarche at 13, and has a family history of endometriosis, is concerned about her risk of developing the condition. Which best describes her endometriosis risk profile?",
      "options": {
        "A": "High risk due to family history",
        "B": "High risk due to increased age",
        "C": "Low risk due to multiple protective factors",
        "D": "Increased risk due to BMI"
      },
      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: C) Low risk due to multiple protective factors Explanation: The patient has several protective factors against endometriosis, such as: Multiparity (three children) Current use of oral contraceptives Smoking (though smoking has other health risks). Risk Factors Protective Factors Nulliparous (Increased estrogen) Early Menarche Late Menopause Low BMI Multiparity OCP Use Smoking High risk due to family history (Option A): Family history alone doesn't outweigh her multiple protective factors. High risk due to increased age (Option B): Age is not a primary risk factor for developing endometriosis. Increased risk due to BMI (Option D): High BMI has no risk associated with endometriosis.

      "explanation": "Correct Answer: D) Direct implantation Explanation: Direct implantation theory is the best sites during surgical procedures, such as cesarean sections. Sampson's theory (retrograde menstruation) (Option A) explains endometriosis in the pelvic cavity, such as on the ovaries, pouch of Douglas, and uterosacral ligaments, and not in surgical scars. Halban's theory of lymphatic spread (Option B) is used to explain distant sites of endometriosis, particularly in the umbilicus, but not surgical scar endometriosis. Ivanoff's theory of coelomic metaplasia (Option C) is often used to explain endometriosis in unusual locations like the lungs, where peritoneal cells transform into endometrial-like tissue.

      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "macrophages Correct Answer: B) Presence of endometrial glands and stroma with hemosiderin-laden macrophages stroma outside the uterus. In ectopic endometrial implants, hemosiderin-laden macrophages result from cyclic bleeding and red blood cell breakdown. Diagnosis Guidelines: Current guidelines do not require histologic confirmation to diagnose endometriosis, often based on clinical presentation and macroscopic findings during laparoscopy. Macroscopic Findings: Powder-burn or Gunshot Lesions: Dark, blackish-bluish puckered lesions on the peritoneal surface. Clear Vesicles: Small, blister-like lesions on the ovarian surface or peritoneum. Red Polypoidal Lesions: Red, polyp-like, vascularised lesions. White Scarred Lesions: White, scar-like areas with fibrosis and few blood vessels. Yellow-brown Peritoneal Discoloration: Indicates hemosiderin deposition and chronic endometriosis. Correlation of Gross Appearance with Microscopic Findings Red Lesions: Vascularized, indicating active endometriotic tissue. White Lesions: Fibrosis with few vessels, suggesting chronic or scarred tissue. Histologic Examination Hemosiderin Deposition: Common in histologic samples, indicating prior bleeding within the lesion. Histologic Diagnosis Criteria: The presence of both endometrial glands and stroma is required to confirm endometriosis. Endometrial glands and stroma are key, but long-standing lesions typically include hemosiderin-laden macrophages (Option A) . Endometriosis diagnosis requires both glandular and stromal components, not glands alone (Option C) . Hemosiderin-laden macrophages without endometrial glands and stroma are not specific to endometriosis and can occur in other conditions with chronic bleeding (Option D) .

      "explanation": "Correct Answer: B) Laparoscopy and histopathology Explanation: This scenario describes a classic presentation of endometriosis, characterised by chronic pelvic pain, dysmenorrhea, dyspareunia, palpable nodules and chocolate cyst. Investigations for Endometriosis: Ultrasonography (TVS and ERUS) : Initial investigation, where endometrioma appears as ground glass opacities and hemorrhagic cysts appear as thread-like structures. Laparoscopy: Investigation of choice, with new lesions visualised as red flame-like and chronic lesions as powder-burnt appearance. Histopathology: Gold standard for confirming the diagnosis, showing blood-filled macrophages (hemosiderophages). Laparotomy (Option A) : Not done for confirmatory purposes due to its invasiveness and higher risk of complications. MRI (Option C): This is not routinely done but is accurate for diagnosing deep-infiltrating endometriosis (DIE), such as Bowel, Thoracic, Bladder, and Rectovaginal endometriosis, and is done before laparoscopy.

ASRM Staging is used. ASRM (American Society for Reproductive Medicine) staging of endometriosis: It is used to classify the severity and extent of endometriotic lesions found during surgical exploration (usually laparoscopy). Bladder is not evaluated for scoring in ASRM.

      "question": "A 30 year old woman with a history of moderate to severe pelvic pain due to endometriosis was prescribed continuous leuprolide three months ago. Despite treatment, she presents again with persistent pelvic pain that interferes with daily activities and quality of life. What is the most appropriate next step in the management?",
      "options": {
        "A": "Increase the dose of GnRH agonist",
        "B": "Expectant management",
        "C": "Laparoscopy",
        "D": "Add progestins"
      },
      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: C) Laparoscopy Explanation: Laparoscopy is the preferred next step for moderate to severe pain as it allows for direct visualisation and surgical management of endometriosis, including fulguration of lesions, adhesiolysis, and management of endometriomas. This approach aims to provide symptomatic relief. Management of Endometriosis: COC - Combined oral contraceptives CC - Clomiphene citrate IUI - Intrauterine insemination Medical management of endometriosis includes: Mild pain Moderate to severe pain NSAIDs & OCPs (First line) Progesterone (Second line) Continuous GnRH agonist (Third line) Continuous GnRH agonist / GnRH antagonist (First line) Laparoscopy, if medical management fails. Laparoscopy: Investigation of choice in endometriosis, used for diagnosing, staging, and therapeutic management of pain Other Drugs useful in endometriosis are: Aromatase inhibitors (Letrozole) Progesterone receptor modulators (Mifepristone, Ulipristal) GnRH Antagonists (Injection: Ganirelix and cetrirelix) Tab Danazol (400 mg/day) Increase the dose of GnRH agonist (Option A): If the patient is already on continuous leuprolide for three months and still experiencing persistent pelvic pain, increasing the dose is unlikely to provide significant additional benefit and may increase the risk of side effects without improving outcomes. Expectant management (Option B): Given the persistent severe pelvic pain and interference with daily activities despite initial treatment, expectant management is not appropriate as it would not address the ongoing symptoms effectively. Add progestins (Option D): Progestins can be used as an adjunctive therapy in endometriosis management. However, if leuprolide (a potent hormonal treatment) has not sufficiently controlled symptoms, adding progestins may not be effective in achieving adequate symptom relief.",

        "D": "Follow-up 6 monthly with transvaginal ultrasound"
      },
      "correct_answer": "D",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: D) Follow-up 6 monthly with transvaginal ultrasound Explanation: In this scenario, the patient has a 3 cm asymptomatic endometrioma and does not desire future fertility. According to current guidelines, Follow-up 6 monthly with transvaginal ultrasound (TVS) is the most appropriate management for endometrioma as surgical interventions are indicated only for cysts> 5cm. Management of Endometrioma: If the patient wants to conceive: Expectant management is done, irrespective of the size of the endometrioma If pregnancy is not desired: Size < 5cm and Asymptomatic: Follow up six monthly / 1 yearly with TVS Size >5cm: Laparoscopic cystectomy (Option A) Total Abdominal Hysterectomy (Option B): Done only in women > 40 years after completion of family. Prevents the formation of new lesions and pain due to it. Laparoscopy procedures include: Adhesiolysis Fulgration of implants Laparoscopic uterosacral nerve ablation (LUNA) Laparoscopic uterosacral nerve ablation (LUNA) (Option C) : It involves disrupting nerve pathways to alleviate pain associated with endometriosis, particularly pelvic pain. It is not indicated for the management of ovarian endometriomas.

      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: B) USG - TVS with Doppler Explanation: The given scenario suggests adenomyosis, where USG - TVS with Doppler serves as the first-line and most helpful investigation for diagnosis. Adenomyosis usually occurs in parous women above the age of 40. Presents as Abnormal uterine bleeding with chronic pelvic pain. The uterus is enlarged and globular if the adenomyosis is diffuse. Investigation of choice: TVS preferably with color Doppler Shutter / Venetian Blind sign : Echogenic linear striations indicating endometrial gland invasion into sub-endometrial tissue. Colour Doppler shows central vascularity (whereas leiomyomas show peripheral vascularity) Diagnostic criteria of adenomyosis The asymmetrical thickness of the uterine walls (posterior > anterior) Heterogeneous myometrial echotexture Small myometrial hypoechoic cysts honeycomb appearance Striated projections extending from endometrium to myometrium Endometrial echo poorly defined J–Z thickening ≥ 12 mm. If USG is inconclusive, an MRI can be done to diagnose adenomyosis. USG - TVS without color Doppler (Option A): It shows adenomyosis features but may cause confusion between submucosal leiomyoma and adenomyosis. Colour Doppler helps to differentiate between them based on the vascularity of the masses. MRI (Option C): Although MRI is more sensitive in diagnosing adenomyosis, it is not the initial investigation of choice as it is not cost-effective . It can be used to diagnose adenomyosis when the USG-TVS is inconclusive. Hysteroscopy (Option D): It allows direct visualisation of the uterine cavity, but it is invasive and is typically not used to investigate adenomyosis.",
