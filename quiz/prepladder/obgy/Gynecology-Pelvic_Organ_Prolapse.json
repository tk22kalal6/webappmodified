Sling Surgery for Uterine Prolapse: Indications: Symptomatic uterine prolapse (heaviness, bulging, urinary symptoms). Women whose childbearing is incomplete. Types: Dynamic Sling Uses materials allowing for some movement and flexibility. Eg: Purandare sling Static Sling Utilizes non-flexible materials providing rigid support. Eg:Shirodkar sling and Khanna sling Composite Combines elements of both dynamic and static slings Eg: Virkud sling Sling surgery: Anterior attachment : Pubocervical fascia (supports the bladder and anterior vaginal wall). Posterior attachment : Sacrospinous ligament (supports posterior vaginal wall). Vaginal hysterectomy (Option A) addresses uterine prolapse effectively, it is not the preferred option for reproductive-age women seeking to preserve their fertility. Sacrocolpopexy (Option B) is commonly used for vault prolapse after hysterectomy. Fothergill's repair (Option C) (not routinely performed) can be performed in women who have completed childbearing.

Enterocele (small bowel prolapse): Symptoms: Bulging sensation in the vagina. Lower back pain and pelvic discomfort increased during intercourse. Difficulty with bowel movements (constipation, feeling of incomplete evacuation) Rectovaginal examination: bulge (containing bowel loops) close to the cervix and cannot be reached by the finger inside the rectum Diagnosis: Dynamic MRI defecography Management: Conservative: kegel exercise, pessary. Surgical: Laparoscopic abdominal repair along with vaginal repair Rectocele is a prolapse of the rectum into the posterior vaginal wall, causing a bulge that can be reached by the finger on rectovaginal examination. Cystocele refers to the prolapse of the bladder into the anterior vaginal wall, leading to urinary symptoms. Relaxed perineum is weakening the perineal body due to an old scar of incomplete perineal tear.
