Spina Bifida (Option C) : Types of Spina Bifida Description Spina Bifida Occulta Spine is abnormal, but the spinal cord is unaffected. Overlying skin is usually normal. May have a small dimple, tuft of hair, or sinus over the skin indicating the defect. Meningocele (Option B) Protrusion of a sac of meninges through the vertebral defect.
