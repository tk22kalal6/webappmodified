      "question": "A 30-year-old pregnant female at 28 weeks of gestation presents with fever, acute pain abdomen, and mild leukocytosis. On examination, she has tenderness over the lower abdomen, and the uterus feels enlarged. Fetal heart rate monitoring shows no abnormalities. What is the most probable diagnosis here?",

        "A": "Red degeneration",
        "B": "Uterine torsion",
        "C": "Infection of the fibroid",
        "D": "Preterm labour"
      },
      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer A - Red degeneration of fibroid: The clinical features of acute abdominal pain, fever, and mild leukocytosis at 28 weeks of gestation suggest the diagnosis of red degeneration of fibroid. Red degeneration Red degeneration, also known as carneous degeneration, is a complication of uterine fibroids that can occur during pregnancy. This condition is most likely to arise during the second half of pregnancy and the puerperium , impacting an estimated 5-10% of women with uterine fibroids. Pathophysiology : Blood supply is redirected to the developing fetus, resulting in decreased blood supply to the fibroid and subsequent degeneration. Conservative management with pain relief and supportive care is the best course of management. It involves pain relief with NSAIDs or acetaminophen, hydration, and bed rest. Uterine torsion (Option B) When a myoma rotates at the site of attachment to the uterus, causing occlusion of veins, it leads to torsion. Usually associated with subserosal pedunculated myoma and causes very severe abdominal pain. Fever is not noted and has no particular association with pregnancy. Infection of the fibroid (Option C) is common in submucosal polyps that protrude in the cervix or vagina, leading to infection. Blood-stained purulent discharge may be noted. Preterm labour (Option D) is characterized by progressively increasing painful uterine contractions, which are associated with cervical dilatation and cervical discharge.

      "question": "Which of the following is NOT associated with fibroids?",
      "options": {
        "A": "Pelvic mass",
        "B": "Amenorrhoea",
        "C": "Infertility",
        "D": "Menstrual irregularity"
      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: B) Amenorrhoea Explanation: Amenorrhoea (absence of menstrual periods) is not a common feature of fibroids. While fibroids often cause abnormal uterine bleeding, including heavy or prolonged periods, they typically do not lead to a complete absence of menstruation. Fibroid (Uterine Leiomyoma) Benign smooth muscle tumor of the uterus. Estrogen-dependent growth; typically regresses after menopause. Commonly occurs in reproductive-age women. Types (Based on Location): These fibroids are classified as Type 0 under the FIGO classification of fibroids. FIGO Classification of Fibroids Type Name Submucosal 0 Pedunculated, Intracavity 1 <50% Intramural and rest in cavity 2 ≥ 50% Intramural and a part in cavity 3 100% intramural but contacts endometrium Intramural 4 Intramural Subserosal 5 ≥ 50% Intramural and partly in serosa 6 <50% Intramural and rest in serosa 7 Subserosal Pedunculated Others 8 Other - Cervical, Parasitic 2-5 Hybrid - Present both in the cavity (type 2) and in the serosa (type 5) Symptoms: Menorrhagia (heavy menstrual bleeding). Dysmenorrhea (painful menstruation). Pelvic pain or pressure. Dyspareunia (painful intercourse). Urinary symptoms (frequency, urgency, or retention). Infertility or recurrent miscarriages. Signs: Enlarged, irregular, firm uterus on bimanual examination. Mobility of the uterus may be reduced if fibroids are large. Complications: Severe anemia due to chronic menorrhagia. Infertility and subfertility. Recurrent pregnancy loss. Red degeneration (painful necrosis, often during pregnancy). Torsion of pedunculated fibroids. Malignant transformation (rare; <1% cases to leiomyosarcoma). Diagnosis: Ultrasound: Primary imaging modality; identifies size, number, and location. Hysteroscopy: For evaluation of submucosal fibroids. MRI: Detailed imaging in complex or unclear cases. Sonohysterography: Detects submucosal fibroids and cavity distortion. Treatment Options: Medical: Hormonal therapy (GnRH agonists, progestins). Non-hormonal options (NSAIDs, tranexamic acid). Surgical: Myomectomy: For preserving fertility. Hysterectomy: Definitive treatment for symptomatic fibroids in women who have completed childbearing. Uterine artery embolization (UAE): Minimally invasive, for reducing fibroid size and symptoms. Other Interventions: MRI-guided focused ultrasound (non-invasive ablation). Laparoscopic or hysteroscopic resection. Prognosis: Recurrence possible after myomectomy, especially in younger women.",

      "question": "As a senior resident in the OBG department, which of the following cases would you not consider uterine artery embolization as a treatment option?",
      "options": {
        "A": "Patient with postpartum haemorrhage",

      },
      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: C) Patient diagnosed with calcified and pedunculated submucous fibroids stalk, projecting into the uterine cavity. These fibroids are better managed by surgical removal, such as hysteroscopic resection, rather than uterine artery embolization (UAE). UAE is generally indicated for larger, intramural fibroids or multiple fibroids causing symptoms like heavy menstrual bleeding or pain.

Postpartum hemorrhage (PPH) (Option A): Uterine artery embolization is an effective treatment option for postpartum hemorrhage. By blocking the uterine blood supply, it can control bleeding and reduce the need for invasive surgical procedures, such as hysterectomy. Placenta accreta (Option B): In cases of placenta accreta, where the placenta is abnormally adherent to the uterine wall, UAE can be performed pre-operatively to reduce uterine blood flow, thereby minimizing the risk of severe bleeding during placenta removal. Menorrhagia in multiparous women (Option D): For multiparous women with menorrhagia due to fibroids, UAE can be considered. By decreasing blood flow to the fibroids, it alleviates symptoms like heavy or prolonged menstrual bleeding.",
