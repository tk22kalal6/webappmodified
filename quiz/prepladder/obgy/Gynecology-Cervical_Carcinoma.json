      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Correct answer: B) Perform colposcopy. Explanation: Given the patient's ASC-US cytology result and positive HPV test, colposcopy is recommended to further evaluate the cervical abnormalities. Pap Smear Results Interpretation: Pap Smear Result Management Unsatisfactory Sample Repeat test in 2-4 months; persistent inadequacy → colposcopy Negative for Intraepithelial Lesion or Malignancy (NILM) Aged 21-29 - Cytology every 3 years Aged 30-65- Cytology every 3 years or co-testing every 5 years Atypical Squamous Cells of Undetermined Significance (ASC-US) Followed by HPV co-test.HPV test may be done on the same cells used for the Pap test. This is called reflex testing. If Positive HPV: Colposcopy. (Option B) If Negative HPV: Repeat co-test after 3 years. (Option D) If HPV Testing NOT done: Repeat cytology in 1 year ; colposcopy if abnormal. (Option A) LSIL Women ≥ 25 Years Colposcopy. If HPV-negative: Repeat cotesting in 1 year. Women 21–24 Years Repeat cytology at 12 and 24 months (follow ASC-US guidelines). Pregnant Women Manage as non-pregnant. No ECC; defer colposcopy until 6 weeks postpartum if needed. Postmenopausal Women Reflex HPV, repeat Pap (6 & 12 months), or colposcopy. If HPV-negative/no CIN: Repeat in 12 months. If HPV-positive/ASC or worse: Colposcopy. Routine screening after 2 negative cytology results. ASC but Cannot Exclude HSIL Colposcopy HSIL Glandular Cell Abnormalities Colposcopy and endocervical sampling; endometrial sampling for certain women; no reflex HPV testing Carcinoma Diagnostic excision procedure if initial evaluation does not indicate invasive cancer Further Steps: Colposcopy: Visualizes the cervix under magnification to identify suspicious areas for biopsy. Biopsy: Confirms diagnosis and guides further management. Treatment: Depends on dysplasia severity, patient's age, fertility desires, and other factors.

Pelvic radiation (symptom control) Systemic chemotherapy Radiotherapy: External beam radiation therapy (teletherapy) : Delivers radiation to the pelvis, targeting both the tumor and regional lymph nodes. Brachytherapy : Delivers a high dose of radiation directly to the tumor using an intracavitary applicator or implant. It is often administered after external beam radiation therapy to provide an extra boost of radiation to the tumor site. Intensity Modulated Radiation Therapy (IMRT) : More accurate irradiation of tumor targets, and spares nearby normal organs. Point A 2 cm superior and 2 cm lateral to the external cervical os. Maximum radiation delivered is up to 7000 to 8000 rads. Point B It is located 3 cm lateral to Point A and corresponds to the obturator lymph nodes Maximum radiation delivered is up to 6000 rads.

      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "Correct answer: A) Stump carcinoma Explanation: The given scenario describes a patient with a history of subtotal hysterectomy who presents with vaginal bleeding and an ulcerative growth on the vaginal vault, which is suggestive of stump carcinoma. Stump Carcinoma: A cervical cancer that occurs after a subtotal hysterectomy , in which the cervix is left in place. Less common than other forms of cervical cancer, occurring in 1-2% of patients who have had a subtotal hysterectomy. If stump carcinoma develops within 2 years of the procedure , the cancer is likely present, though undiagnosed, at the time of the surgery. The risk of stump carcinoma can be decreased by obtaining a Pap smear before a hysterectomy. Treatment requires a combination of surgery and radiation therapy. Recurrent cervical cancer (Option B), in this patient there is no history of previous cervical cancer also cancer arises from the remaining cervical tissue, making it a primary tumor of the cervical stump, not a recurrence. Vaginal cancer (Option C), while vaginal cancer can present with similar symptoms, the history of subtotal hysterectomy and the location makes stump carcinoma more likely. Endometrial cancer (Option D): This patient underwent a subtotal hysterectomy, meaning a portion of the uterus, including the endometrium, was removed, making endometrial cancer unlikely.

      "explanation": "Correct answer: C) Radical trachelectomy with pelvic lymphadenectomy Explanation: This patient's presentation aligns with stage IB1 cervical cancer , characterized by a clinically visible lesion confined to the cervix measuring ≤ 2 cm. Radical trachelectomy is a fertility-sparing or preserving surgical procedure and, therefore, balances cancer treatment with the patient's desire for future childbearing For women with early-stage cervical cancer who do not desire future fertility, radical hysterectomy with pelvic lymphadenectomy is a standard treatment. This procedure involves the removal of the uterus, cervix, part of the upper vagina, and surrounding tissues Stage Surgical Management Post-Surgical Management IA1 Simple hysterectomy (Type I). Conization if family not complete Regular pelvic exams and Pap smears. IA1 (with LVSI) Modified radical hysterectomy (Type II) + pelvic lymphadenectomy (PLND). Radical trachelectomy + PLND (consider SNLB) for selected patients desiring fertility IA2 Radical hysterectomy + PLND (consider SNLB if tumor <2 cm). Radical trachelectomy + PLND for selected patients desiring fertility. If the specimen shows high-risk features - Adjuvant chemoradiation. Regular pelvic exams and Pap smears.

IB2 Radical hysterectomy + PLND IIA1 IB3 - IIA2 Chemoradiation Regular pelvic exams and Pap smears IIB - IVA Chemoradiation IVB Palliative chemotherapy and/or Palliative radiotherapy LVSI: Lymphovascular space involvement Note : In young females, the ovaries are often spared during surgery to prevent premature menopause. Removing the ovaries can lead to long-term health issues such as osteoporosis, cardiovascular disease, and cognitive decline. Radical Trachelectomy: A fertility-sparing surgical procedure that involves removing the cervix, a portion of the upper vagina, and the parametria (tissues surrounding the cervix). A non-absorbable cerclage (a stitch around the cervix) may be placed during the procedure to help support a future pregnancy. Pelvic lymphadenectomy is performed concurrently. Lymph Nodes Removed: Paracervical. Parametrial. Obturator. Internal iliac. External iliac. Lymph Nodes Not Removed: Paraaortic lymph nodes (unless there is suspicion of metastasis). Radical hysterectomy with bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy (Option A) is a definitive treatment for cervical cancer; it would leave the patient unable to bear children. Chemoradiation (Option B) is a standard treatment for locally advanced cervical cancer,",

      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: B) To assess the endocervical canal epithelium for dysplasia Explanation: Endocervical Curettage (ECC) is indicated when the SCJ is fully visualized during colposcopy, but no lesion is identified, especially in cases of atypical cytology like ASC-H, to evaluate the endocervical canal epithelium for dysplasia. Endocervical Curettage (ECC) Procedure Done during colposcopy to evaluate endocervical canal epithelium. Method Insert curette 1-2 cm into cervical canal, scrape, and collect sample for histologic evaluation. Tool Used Endocervical curette followed by ring forceps or cytobrush. Indications SCJ not fully visualized. SCJ fully visualized but no lesion identified. Initial evaluation of ASC-H, HSIL, AGC, or AIS cytology results. Pregnancy Risk of complications like amnion rupture and infection. Alternatives Endocervical brushing: More sensitive alternative, challenging for dysplasia grading. Combined use for enhanced sensitivity and grading. To collect endocervical samples for HPV testing (Option A) : HPV testing is typically used for screening or as an adjunct to cytology. In this case, the focus should be on assessing the presence of dysplasia rather than re-testing for HPV. To confirm the presence of adenocarcinoma in situ (AIS) (Option C) : While AIS involves the glandular epithelium, ASC-H suggests a squamous process. The concern here is high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions, not AIS. To evaluate the depth of invasion in suspected cervical cancer (Option D) : This option is relevant only if there is a suspicion of invasive cancer. In this case, the colposcopy didn’t reveal a visible lesion, and the cytology suggests a high-grade squamous process rather than invasive cancer.

      },
      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Correct answer: C) Consider Cold-knife Conization (CKC). Explanation: Cold-knife conization (CKC) is preferred for treating adenocarcinoma in situ (AIS) due to its ability to provide a larger, intact tissue specimen. This allows for accurate histopathological evaluation of margins and thorough assessment of the extent of the lesion, which is crucial for managing AIS effectively. Cold-Knife Conization (CKC): Surgical removal of a cone-shaped section of cervical tissue (Ectocervix, endocervix and transformation zone) using a scalpel. It is a diagnostic + therapeutic procedure Anesthesia: Typically performed under general anesthesia in an operating room. Indications for CKC: Adenocarcinoma in Situ (AIS): According to the WHO guidelines, CKC should be preferred over LEEP for the treatment of histologically confirmed AIS, regardless of the patient's HIV status.

      },
      "correct_answer": "D",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: D) LEEP Explanation: Large Loop Excision of the Transformation Zone (LLETZ or LEEP) is indicated in cases of high-grade CIN where there is incomplete colposcopic visualization and confirmed by endocervical sampling. It allows for complete excision of the transformation zone and abnormal tissue, providing both diagnostic and therapeutic benefits. Large Loop Excision of the Transformation Zone (LLETZ or LEEP ) Mechanism Surgical procedure to remove cervical transformation zone and precancerous tissue. Uses low-voltage diathermy to generate heat, cutting and cauterizing tissue simultaneously to minimize bleeding. Procedure Loop inserted laterally to the lesion, advanced to required depth, then brought across to excise cone-shaped tissue. Excised tissue sent for histopathologic examination to confirm diagnosis and assess margins. Depth Control Adjusted by sliding guard on electrode shaft, tailoring procedure to lesion characteristics. LEEP Preferred Over Other Procedures for High-Grade Cytologic Abnormalities (ASC-H, HSIL, AGC, AIS) Incomplete Colposcopic Visualization Confirmed CIN 3 or AIS Positive Endocervical Sampling (Ungraded or high-grade CIN, glandular neoplasia) Treatment Failure or Recurrence of high-grade CIN Advantages Generally safe, low complication rates. Easy to perform OP procedure with local anesthesia. Equipment costs are relatively low. Provides tissue sample for histopathology. Disadvantages Thermal damage may obscure specimen margins. Requires specialized training for providers. Risk of bleeding post-procedure. Theoretical risk of inhaling tissue plume. Reference: Williams Gynecology, 4th Edition, Page 640",

        "D": "None of the above"
      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Correct answer: B) Cryoablation Explanation: Cryoablation is a local destructive method used to freeze and destroy abnormal cervical tissue, such as CIN 1 . It is a suitable treatment option when there is a persistent lesion >2 years which is showing no signs of regression. Also, the entire lesion and SCJ must be visible during colposcopy. Most lesions have spontaneous regression and require no treatment as such. Treatment Considerations for CIN 1: CIN 1 persisting over 2 years with entire lesion and SCJ visible, no HSIL in endocervical sampling: Preferred treatment is cryoablation. If above criteria not met (lesion visibility, HSIL absence): Excisional treatment is recommended; ablation is not suitable. (Option C) Persistent LSIL may warrant treatment. Patient factors (compliance, preference) may influence treatment decisions. Colposcopy findings may indicate need for treatment. Treatment Options: Local Destructive Methods: Cryosurgery: Freezing abnormal tissue. Electrocoagulation: Using heat from electrical current. Laser Ablation: Using a laser to destroy abnormal cells. Excisional Treatments: LEEP/LLETZ: Removing abnormal tissue with a wire loop electrode. (Option C) Cone Biopsy: Removing a cone-shaped piece of tissue from the cervix. Cryoablation Local destructive treatment for CIN using freeze-thaw-freeze technique. Instrument: Metal probe uses nitrous oxide to freeze tissue (cryonecrosis). Mechanism: Freezes tissue to 4-5 mm depth using agents like CO2 (-60°C), Freon (-60°C), Nitrous Oxide (-80°C). Indications for Cryoablation: Small cervical lesions. Entirely ectocervical lesions and visible SCJ. Smooth cervical surface without deep crevices. Circumferential length adequate to prevent vaginal wall thermal damage. Advantages: Inexpensive, well-tolerated, painless OP procedure (lasts over 9 mins) Exclusions: Not for previously treated patients, glandular abnormalities, or AIS. Disadvantages: Profuse discharge for 7-10 days post-procedure. Challenges in subsequent colposcopy screenings due to junction retraction. P16 immunochemistry testing (Option A) detects p16 protein overexpression associated with high-risk HPV infections and cervical dysplasia. It helps differentiate between LSIL and HSIL but does not treat CIN 1. Reference: Shaw's Gynecology, 17th Edition, Page 416-419 https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5644341/",

      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Correct answer: C) To identify areas of abnormal tissue Explanation: Acetic acid dehydrates the epithelial cells and causes areas with a higher nuclear-to-cytoplasmic ratio (which are more likely to be dysplastic or abnormal) to turn white, highlighting areas that may require biopsy. Colposcopy: Procedure Overview : Examines the cervix using illumination and magnification to identify abnormalities and guide treatment decisions. Indications Relative Contraindications Triage after positive screening test Assessing eligibility for therapy: Determines if ablative or excisional therapy is appropriate after a positive screening test. Suspected cervical cancer Positive HPV test Positive Pap test result (pap smear is screening test where as colposcopy is diagnostic test) No abnormal growth in per speculum in a suspected case. Determining transformation zone type. Visually evaluates the cervix to determine the visibility and position of the transformation zone, crucial for eligibility for ablative treatment. Facilitating biopsy or excisional treatment Provides a magnified view for targeted biopsies or excisional procedures like LLETZ or CKC. Active reproductive tract infection Severe uncontrolled hypertension Uncooperative or overly anxious patient Note: If abnormal growth is visualized in per speculum, punch biopsy is preferred over colposcopy guided biopsy. Procedure Protocol Pre-colposcopic Evaluation Review medical/surgical history, perform urine pregnancy test if indicated Bimanual Examination Assess for cervical enlargement, masses, or pelvic tenderness Visual Inspection Inspect cervix, note squamocolumnar junction (SCJ) Solution Application Apply saline, apply 3%-5% acetic acid (abnormal tissue turns white), apply Lugol's iodine (healthy tissue stains dark brown) Colposcopic Evaluation Examine for acetowhite changes, identify abnormal vascular patterns (e.g., punctation, mosaicism), identify lesions Colposcopic Findings: Acetowhitening: Abnormal areas turn white with acetic acid Vascular Patterns: Punctation, mosaicism suggest high-grade lesions Margins: Sharp margins indicate high-grade lesions",

      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Correct answer: C) Type III Explanation: Type III transformation zone is partially or not fully visible and extends into the endocervical canal, as described in the scenario Transformation Zone: The cervix is derived from the Mullerian duct. The non-keratinized stratified squamous epithelium of the urogenital sinus replaces the columnar epithelium of the Mullerian duct. This migration continues till external os. This junction between both epitheliums is called the squamocolumnar junction (SCJ) and is present at the external os until puberty. After puberty, as the estrogen levels rise → glycogen rises → metabolized by lactobacillus into lactic acid, creating a stimulus for squamous metaplasia (replacement of columnar cells by squamous cells). This creates a new SCJ, and the zone between the original SCJ and the new SCJ is known as the transformation zone. This transformation zone responds to estrogen and moves towards ectocervix under its influence. Types: Type Seen in Appearance Type 1 (Option A) Adolescence Pregnancy OCPs The entire TZ is visible and is only ectocervical Type 2 (Option B) Premenopausal The entire TZ is visible but has some endocervical component Type 3 (Option C) Menopause Progestin only pills The TZ is partially visible and extends into endocervix Type IV (Option D): Not a recognized classification in the colposcopic transformation zone types.",

Explanation: HPV DNA Testing: There are 12 high-risk HPV types: HPV 16, 18, 31, 33, 35, 39, 45, 51, 52, 56, 58, and 59. Two of these, HPV 16 and HPV 18, are responsible for most HPV-related cancers like cervical, anogenital, oral, laryngeal, penile, vulval/vaginal cancer HPV DNA testing can identify specific subtypes of HPV, including high-risk types like HPV 16 and 18 , enabling better risk assessment and management. (Option A) HPV 16 is most commonly associated with squamous cell carcinoma , while HPV 18 is linked to cervical adenocarcinoma. HPV DNA testing plays a crucial role in distinguishing between high-risk and low-risk HPV infections. Most women clear HPV infections, persistent infection with high-risk types can lead to precancerous lesions and eventually cervical cancer. HPV DNA testing , often in combination with a Pap test (co-testing) , can be a cost-effective screening method for cervical cancer, especially in women over 30. HPV DNA testing can be used for all age group as both a primary screening tool and a diagnostic tool. (Option B) A positive result indicates the presence of an HPV infection but doesn't necessarily equate to cancer as many HPV infections are transient and clear naturally. (Option D) HPV DNA tests are highly sensitive as they directly target the underlying viral DNA , often leading to earlier detection of high-risk infections.

If HPV-positive/ASC or worse: Colposcopy. Routine screening after 2 negative cytology results. High-grade Squamous Intraepithelial Lesion (HSIL) Suggests a high-grade precancerous lesion. Colposcopy with biopsy. Adenocarcinoma In Situ (AIS) Indicates the presence of precancerous glandular cells. Colposcopy with biopsy. Malignant Cells Indicates the presence of cancerous cells. Colposcopy with biopsy. Endocervical curettage is avoided during pregnancy to prevent uterine irritation, bleeding, or potential harm to the developing fetus. If colposcopy-directed biopsy fails to confirm a malignancy, diagnostic conization is done. Repeat Pap smear in 1 year (Option A) , given the potential for high-grade lesions with an ASC-H result, a repeat Pap smear in 1 year would delay diagnosis and treatment. HPV testing (Option C) may be considered in conjunction with colposcopy but not definitive. Diagnosis is confirmed through histologic evaluation of biopsies taken.

Explanation: Primary HPV DNA testing every 5 yr for cervical cancer screening is recommended for women aged 30-65 years. the The recommendations for co-testing with Pap smear & HPV testing are also the same. If cytology (Pap smear alone) is done then screening interval is every 3 yearly. Since the patient’s last Pap smear was 3 years ago and was normal and she is less than 30 years age, she is due for a repeat Pap smear and not HPV DNA testing, as HPV testing is recommended in women beyond 30 years of age. Pap Smear Site Transformation zone of the cervix, where the squamous epithelium (ectocervix) and columnar epithelium (endocervix) meet. This is the most common site for cervical cancer to develop. Instruments Ayre spatula collects cells from the ectocervix Cervical broom (also called a cytobrush) from transition zone Endocervical brush from endocervix Procedure Conventional Pap smear : Cells are collected with a spatula or brush, smeared onto a slide, and immediately fixed with a spray fixative or by immersing in 95% ethanol with/without ether Liquid-based cytology : Cells are collected and then rinsed into a liquid fixative vial. This is considered more sensitive than the conventional Pap smear as it provides a more uniform distribution of cells. Considerations Sensitivity : A single Pap test has a sensitivity of 47-62% for detecting high-grade cervical lesions. HPV co-testing: Combining the Pap smear with HPV DNA testing significantly improves screening accuracy. (Option C) (Option B) Colposcopy : Colposcopy, with biopsy if indicated, is the gold standard for evaluating abnormal Pap results. (Option D) Indications Cervical cancer screening : Routine screening for women aged 21-65 years, with the frequency and type of testing varying based on age and risk factors. (Option A) Evaluation of abnormal vaginal bleeding : While not a primary diagnostic tool, a Pap smear is performed as part of the workup, along with other tests. Timing & Frequency Age 21-29: Cytology (Pap smear) every 3 years. Age 30-65: Co-testing (Pap smear + HPV testing) every 5 years. >65: No further screening if they have had 3 consecutive negative cytology results or 2 consecutive negative co-test results and no history of high-grade precancerous lesions. H/o of CIN 2 or higher: Annual screening for 20 years. More frequent screening in HIV and Immunocompromised patients. Contraindications Avoided during menstruation. (Relative C/I)",

        "D": "Causing chronic inflammation leading to cancer"
      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Correct answer: B) Suppression of tumor suppressor genes Explanation: Human Papillomavirus (HPV): HPV, a dsDNA virus, causes almost all cervical cancers. HPV vaccine is against L1 capsid protein. Viral replication is carried out by E1 and E2 protein It primarily infects human squamous cells or metaplastic epithelial cells. HPV has a epitheliotropic effect which leads to the formation of Koilocytes Koilocytes are epithelial cells characterised by perinuclear haloes surrounding condensed nuclei and are commonly present in cervical intraepithelial neoplasia. Clinically, HPV are divided into 2 types: Low risk HPV (6 & 11) cause nearly all genital warts, laryngeal papillomas and are rarely oncogenic. High risk HPV (16 & 18) cause approximately 95% of cervical cancers. HPV 16 is the most oncogenic in high risk HPV types. Tumorigenesis: Most women clear HPV infection, but those with persistent infection develop preinvasive lesions. The viral oncoproteins, E6 and E7, are primarily involved in the transformation of normal cells into tumor cells. E6 Binds to p53 tumor suppressor protein E7 Binds to retinoblastoma (Rb) tumor suppressor protein With both oncoproteins, binding leads to the degradation of these suppressor proteins, leading to the uncontrolled proliferation of cells. Produces toxins that cause uncontrolled cell proliferation (Option A) : HPV does not produce toxins. Instead, it produces proteins that interfere with normal cell regulatory processes. Stimulation of the immune system to attack normal cervical cells (Option C) : This is not how HPV leads to cancer. HPV often evades the immune system, allowing the virus to persist and potentially cause cancer. Causing chronic inflammation leading to cancer (Option D) : While chronic inflammation can contribute to cancer development in some cases, the primary mechanism by which HPV leads to cervical cancer is through the suppression of tumor suppressor genes, not through inflammation.",

      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Correct answer: B) Metaplasia is physiological change, whereas dysplasia is pathological intracellular glycogen, which lactobacilli metabolize into lactic acid, lowering vaginal pH. The acidic pH stimulates squamous metaplasia in the cervix, forming the transformation zone (TZ). This physiological process occurs in all women. Dysplastic Changes of the Cervix: Dysplasia occurs when metaplasia occurs in an unorganized manner. It is a pathological process occurring due to the presence of oncogenic stimuli. It is a premalignant condition and can lead to invasive carcinoma It is characterized by abnormal cell growth and changes in cytoplasm within the epithelium. The primary stimulus for dysplasia is due to infection with HPV high-risk agents. Dysplasia can progress to cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) and cervical cancer.
