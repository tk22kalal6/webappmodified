Focal trophoblastic hyperplasia Presence of fetal tissue (may include fetal red blood cells or embryonic/fetal parts). Diffuse villous edema and hydropic swelling. Absence of fetal blood vessels in villi Marked atypical trophoblastic hyperplasia (both cytotrophoblast and syncytiotrophoblast). No fetal tissue is present. A cyst (Option C) may develop in the ovaries or placenta during pregnancy but does not exhibit edematous villi or chromosomal abnormalities like a molar pregnancy. An ectopic pregnancy ( Option D) occurs outside the uterus, does not exhibit molar villi, and lacks the characteristic hydropic changes seen in molar pregnancies.

      "correct_answer": "D",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: D) hCG Explanation: The presentation of grape-like vesicles and the ultrasound finding showing a snowstorm appearance strongly suggest a hydatidiform mole. The most appropriate hormone level to check in this patient is hCG (Human Chorionic Gonadotropin). Follow-up of Molar Pregnancy: β -hCG Monitoring: The initial test is within 48 hours post-evacuation for baseline. Follow-up every 1-2 weeks until 3 consecutive normal values Post-Normalization Testing: Monthly β -hCG tests for another 6 months. Median Resolution Time for GTD : Partial moles: 6 weeks. Complete moles: 7 weeks. Normalisation Timeline of beta HCG levels: 95% by 14 weeks. 99% by 25 weeks Evaluation for gestational trophoblastic neoplasia is required if β -hCG levels increase or plateau. It is advised to avoid conception for up to 12 months. But If Pregnancy is desired, may conceive 6 months after serum beta HCG normalization. Delay pregnancy for 1 year after gestational",

      "question": "A woman who underwent dilatation and curettage for molar pregnancy six months ago presents with persistent abdominal pain and distention symptoms. On further evaluation, the beta-hCG levels were persistently elevated, and cannonball foci were found on the chest X-ray. What is the most likely diagnosis?",
      "options": {
        "A": "Gestational trophoblastic disease",
        "B": "Endometriosis",
        "C": "Ovarian cyst",
        "D": "Asherman's syndrome"
      },
      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: A) Gestational trophoblastic disease Explanation: The clinical manifestations indicate gestational trophoblastic disease (GTD) , specifically its malignant form called gestational trophoblastic neoplasia (GTN) . This diagnosis is supported by the history of molar pregnancy, persistently elevated beta-hCG levels, and characteristic \"cannonball\" metastases on chest X-ray . GTN represents the malignant spectrum of GTD that can develop after a molar pregnancy. The disease is characterized by abnormal trophoblastic proliferation with the potential for local invasion and distant metastasis, particularly to the lungs where they appear as multiple, well-circumscribed \"cannonball\" lesions on chest imaging. Gestational Trophoblastic Disease Definition and Classification Hydatidiform Moles (HM): Complete Mole: No fetal parts, abnormal placental development Partial Mole: Some fetal parts present, abnormal placental tissue Gestational Trophoblastic Neoplasia (GTN): Invasive Mole: Deep penetration into uterine wall Choriocarcinoma: Aggressive malignant form Epithelioid Trophoblastic Tumor (ETT): Rare variant Placental Site Trophoblastic Tumor (PSTT): Originating from implantation site Risk Factors Risk Factors: Maternal age >35 or <21 years Previous molar pregnancy (1% recurrence risk) Asian ethnicity History of spontaneous abortion Dietary deficiencies (vitamin A, animal fats) Blood type A Pathogenesis and Genetics Complete Mole: 46,XX (90%) - all paternal chromosomes 46,XY (10%) - all paternal chromosomes Empty egg fertilized by sperm that duplicates Maternal mitochondrial DNA present Partial Mole: Triploid: 69,XXX, 69,XXY, or 69,XYY Fertilization by two sperm Contains both maternal and paternal DNA Molecular Features: p53 and MDM2 overexpression HLA-G expression in choriocarcinoma Altered NECC1 and growth factor expression Clinical Presentation First Trimester: Vaginal bleeding (84% of cases) Dark brown/prune juice-like discharge Passage of grape-like vesicles Hyperemesis gravidarum Later Presentation: Hyperthyroidism symptoms Early pre-eclampsia (<20 weeks) Respiratory distress Theca lutein cysts Physical Findings: Uterine size-date discrepancy Absent fetal heart tones (complete mole) Adnexal masses Diagnostic Evaluation Imaging Studies: Ultrasound: \"Snowstorm\" or \"grape-like\" pattern Chest X-ray for metastasis (Cannonball foci in lungs) IIIIIII CT/PET for staging MRI for atypical presentations Laboratory Tests: Quantitative β -hCG levels Complete blood count Coagulation studies Liver and renal function Thyroid function tests Histopathological Features: Complete Mole: Diffuse villous edema, trophoblastic hyperplasia Partial Mole: Mixed normal and hydropic villi Choriocarcinoma: Biphasic pattern with hemorrhage Incorrect Options: Endometriosis (Option B) : Endometriosis typically presents with cyclic pelvic pain, dysmenorrhea, and infertility. It would not explain the elevated β -hCG levels or pulmonary lesions. Endometriosis doesn't cause elevated beta-hCG or lung metastases Ovarian cyst (Option C) : Ovarian cyst can cause abdominal pain and distention, but it would not explain persistently elevated β -hCG levels or pulmonary metastases.",

        "A": "Ectopic pregnancy",
        "B": "Hydatidiform mole",
        "C": "Multiple renal cysts in the fetus",
        "D": "Oligohydramnios"
      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: B) Hydatidiform mole Explanation: The ultrasound findings include a heterogeneous mass in the uterine cavity with multiple anechoic spaces , most commonly referred to as a \"snowstorm\" appearance which indicates a complete molar pregnancy. Typically, USG findings of molar pregnancy reveal a distended endometrial cavity containing a heterogeneous intrauterine mass with multiple cystic spaces demonstrating a snowstorm appearance with absent fetal parts. Ectopic pregnancy (Option A): Ectopic pregnancy refers to the implantation of the fertilized egg outside of the uterus, typically in the fallopian tubes. USG findings would show an empty uterine cavity with or without an adnexal mass or free fluid in the pelvis. The described findings do not suggest ectopic pregnancy. Multiple renal cysts in the fetus (Option C): This option refers to the presence of cysts in the fetal kidneys. However, the scenario does not mention any fetal renal abnormalities, and the focus is on the patient's amenorrhea and the ultrasound findings related to the pregnancy.",

        "D": "Rh negative pregnancy"
      },
      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: C) Molar pregnancy Explanation: Hydatidiform mole or molar pregnancy is classified as a benign form of GTD and is characterized by abnormal growth of trophoblastic tissue in the uterus. This results in swollen, fluid-filled villi and significantly elevated β -hCG levels (often in the range of 100,000 mIU/mL or higher). Though initially benign, they can sometimes progress to persistent gestational trophoblastic disease or malignancy. Downs syndrome (Option A) : Downs syndrome is diagnosed through prenatal screening and NIPT. Pregnancy-associated with Neural tube defects (Option B) : Neural tube defects are detected through ultrasound and genetic testing. Rh-negative pregnancy (Option D) : Rh-negative pregnancy doesn't require routine hCG monitoring. Reference: Williams Textbook of Obstetrics, 26th Edition, Pages 236-240",

Hydatidiform mole: Benign form of the gestational trophoblastic disease (GTD). Characterized by abnormal trophoblastic tissue growth in the uterus, leading to swollen, fluid-filled villi and markedly elevated β -hCG levels, often exceeding 100,000 mIU/mL. While initially benign, it can occasionally progress to persistent gestational trophoblastic disease or malignancy. Clinical Findings: Amenorrhea Uterine Bleeding (Most common feature) Uterine Growth: Larger than expected for gestational age and softer in texture.

        "D": "Hysterectomy"
      },
      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: C) EMACO regimen Explanation: The patient has stage IV disease (mets to organs other than lungs) with a score of 11 on the WHO prognostic system. Stage 4 (FIGO) is a criterion by itself for the EMACO regimen . Stage 4 or stages 2 and 3 with a risk score > 6 are criteria for High-risk invasive mole and choriocarcinoma.

High risk = WHO score of ≥ 7. Management ≤ 6 Score: Single Agent : Methotrexate with alternate day folinic acid ≥ 7 Score : EMACO Regimen (preferred regimen) Etoposide Methotrexate Actinomycin D Cyclophosphamide Oncovin Methotrexate with folinic acid (Option A) is generally given for low-risk GTN and not high-risk GTN with metastasis. Methotrexate (Option B) alone is not the most appropriate choice in this case. Methotrexate is typically used in combination with folinic acid to maximize its efficacy while minimizing toxicity in low-risk GTN and not high-risk GTN with metastasis. Hysterectomy (Option D) involves the surgical removal of the uterus. In cases of gestational trophoblastic neoplasia, hysterectomy may be considered as a definitive treatment option if the disease is localized and the patient has completed childbearing.

      "question": "A patient with 12 weeks of amenorrhea presents with vaginal bleeding. On examination, the cervix is favorable. USG shows a snowstorm appearance. What is the next best step in management?",
      "options": {
        "A": "Medical management",
        "B": "Follow up with beta-hCG",
        "C": "Suction and evacuation",
        "D": "Hysterectomy"
      },
      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: C) Suction and evacuation Explanation: The clinical presentation with vaginal bleeding, a favorable cervix and the ultrasound findings of a snowstorm appearance are highly suggestive of a complete or partial molar pregnancy. The patient comes under Group A , where the cervix is favorable. The recommended management includes suction and evacuation . A negative pressure of 200–250 mm Hg is applied during the procedure, which is usually performed under diazepam sedation or general anesthesia. The next best step in management for this condition is suction and evacuation (also known as dilatation and curettage ) to remove the abnormal trophoblastic tissue. Medical management (Option A) is not appropriate in the case of a molar pregnancy. Molar pregnancies require the complete removal of the abnormal tissue. While beta-human chorionic gonadotropin (beta-HCG) levels (Option B) are used to monitor the response to treatment in molar pregnancies, the immediate management in this scenario is to evacuate the uterus due to the risk of complications associated with molar pregnancies. Hysterectomy (Option D) is not the initial management for a molar pregnancy. Conservative management with suction and evacuation is the preferred approach unless there are specific indications for hysterectomy. Reference: https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3279094/#",

      "explanation": "Correct Answer: D) Hydatidiform mole Explanation: The USG image showing a \"snowstorm appearance\" is characteristic of a hydatidiform mole, which is a form of gestational trophoblastic disease. This appearance is due to the presence of multiple cystic spaces within the uterus, representing swollen villi of the placenta. In hydatidiform mole, there is a failure of the embryo to develop, leading to abnormal growth of the placental tissue. Hydatidiform mole is classified as a benign form of GTD and is characterized by abnormal growth of trophoblastic tissue in the uterus. This results in swollen, fluid-filled villi and significantly elevated β -hCG levels (often in the range of 100,000 mIU/mL or higher ).
