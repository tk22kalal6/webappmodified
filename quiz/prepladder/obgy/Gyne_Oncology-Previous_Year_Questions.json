      "options": {
        "A": "Intensity is inversely proportional to squared distance",
        "B": "Small blood vessels are the most radioresistant",

        "D": "Small bowel is the most radioresistant"
      },
      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: A) Intensity is inversely proportional to squared distance Explanation: Intensity is inversely proportional to squared distance. This statement refers to the inverse square law , which states that the intensity of radiation decreases as the distance from the radiation source increases. In other words, the further the distance from the radiation source, the lower the intensity of radiation exposure. This principle is important in radiation therapy planning to ensure that the target area receives the appropriate dose while minimizing exposure to surrounding healthy tissues. Incorrect Options: Small blood vessels are not inherently more radioresistan t (Option B ruled out) . However, it is worth noting that tissues with a rich blood supply may have a greater capacity for repair and recovery from radiation damage compared to tissues with limited blood supply. Rapidly proliferating cells are actually more sensitive to radiation (Option C ruled out) because they are actively dividing and have less time to repair radiation-induced damage. Slowly proliferating or quiescent cells, on the other hand, maybe more radioresistant as they have a greater ability to repair radiation damage. The small bowel is actually considered one of the most radiosensitive organs (Option D ruled out) in the abdomen. It is often a dose-limiting structure in radiation therapy due to its sensitivity to radiation. Special care is taken to minimize radiation exposure to the small bowel during treatment planning.

      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: A) It is a screening test for cervical cancer Explanation: A Pap smear is primarily a screening test for cervical cancer . It is used to detect abnormal cells in the cervix that could potentially develop into cervical cancer if left untreated (Options B, C, and D) . The procedure involves collecting cells from the cervix and examining them under a microscope to identify precancerous or cancerous changes. Regular Pap smears are an important part of cervical cancer prevention and early detection.

      "question": "What should be the subsequent course of action for a 30 year old woman who has been diagnosed with carcinoma in situ of the cervix and has no apparent visible growth?",

        "A": "Hysterectomy",

        "D": "Follow-up after 6 months"
      },
      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: C) Colposcopy and biopsy Explanation: Carcinoma in situ refers to the presence of abnormal cells that have not invaded beyond the surface layer of the cervix. In this scenario, the next step in management would be to perform a colposcopy, which allows for a detailed examination of the cervix using a special magnifying instrument. During colposcopy, targeted biopsies can be taken to confirm the diagnosis and assess the extent of the abnormality. Hysterectomy (Option A) , the surgical removal of the uterus, is not the initial management for carcinoma in situ. It may be considered in more advanced stages or if other treatments have failed. Conization (Option B) , also known as a cone biopsy, involves removing a cone-shaped piece of tissue from the cervix for diagnostic and therapeutic purposes. While it may be performed in certain cases where the lesion is visible, colposcopy and biopsy are usually the initial steps to confirm the diagnosis and determine the extent of the abnormality. Conization also leads to a short cervix which causes cervical incompetence leading to recurrent abortions. It may cause stenosis of cervix which may lead to infertility Given the diagnosis of carcinoma in situ, a more immediate evaluation and intervention are necessary, rather than waiting for a follow-up after 6 months (Option D) .

        "D": "Teenagers"
      },
      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: C) 21 to 65 year old females Explanation: Screening for cervical cancer is recommended for females between the ages of 21 and 65 years. This is the age group at higher risk for developing cervical cancer due to the prevalence of human papillomavirus (HPV) infections. Regular screening with Pap smear or HPV testing can help detect cervical abnormalities and prevent the development of cervical cancer. For women aged 21-65 years, the recommended cervical cancer screening guideline is co-testing with a Pap smear and HPV testing every 5 years if negative. Pap smear Site Transformation zone of the cervix, where the squamous epithelium (ectocervix) and columnar epithelium (endocervix) meet. This is the most common site for cervical cancer to develop. Instruments Ayre spatula collects cells from the ectocervix Cervical broom (also called a cytobrush) from transition zone Endocervical brush from endocervix Procedure Conventional Pap smear : Cells are collected with a spatula or brush, smeared onto a slide, and immediately fixed with a spray fixative or by immersing in 95% ethanol with/without ether Liquid-based cytology : Cells are collected and then rinsed into a liquid fixative vial. This is considered more sensitive than the conventional Pap smear as it provides a more uniform distribution of cells. Considerations Sensitivity : A single Pap test has a sensitivity of 47-62% for detecting high-grade cervical lesions. HPV co-testing: Combining the Pap smear with HPV DNA testing significantly improves screening accuracy. Colposcopy : Colposcopy, with biopsy if indicated, is the gold standard for evaluating abnormal Pap results. Indications Cervical cancer screening : Routine screening for women aged 21-65 years (OptionA) , with the frequency and type of testing varying based on age and risk factors. Evaluation of abnormal vaginal bleeding : While not a primary diagnostic tool, a Pap smear is performed as part of the workup, along with other tests. Timing & Frequency Age 21-29: Cytology (Pap smear) every 3 years. Age 30-65: Co-testing (Pap smear + HPV testing) every 5 years. >65: No further screening if they have had 3 consecutive negative cytology results or 2 consecutive negative co-test results and no history of high-grade precancerous lesions. H/o of CIN 2 or higher: Annual screening for 20 years. More frequent screening in HIV and Immunocompromised patients. Contraindications Avoided during menstruation. (Relative C/I) While older women may still be at risk for cervical cancer, routine screening is not recommended after the age of 65 (Option A) if previous screenings have been negative. Cervical cancer is rare in women younger than 21 years (Option B) , and routine screening is not recommended in this age group. Routine screening for cervical cancer is not recommended for teenagers (Option D) unless there are specific risk factors or symptoms present.",

Vulval Cancer Site Labia majora is the most common (60%). Clitoris 2nd most common (15%). Most common in 50-70 years age group Presentation Exophytic (outward-growing) and ulcerative (open sore) growth. Symptom Pruritus (most common): Often associated with an itch-scratch cycle. Cancer cachexia (weight loss and muscle wasting). Cancer pain. Spread Primarily spreads through the lymphatic system. Vulvar lymphatics cross over at the midline, especially within 2 cm of the midline. The inguinofemoral lymph nodes are the most commonly involved group. Lymph node involvement significantly affects prognosis. Investigations Excisional biopsy (IOC): For lesions < 1 cm in size. Complete lesion removal and histological assessment, including invasion presence and depth. Incisional biopsy: For lesions ≥ 1 cm in size. Wedge biopsy. Keyes punch biopsy. Sentinel lymph node biopsy: Assess lymph node involvement, particularly the inguinofemoral nodes. Treatment of Tumor Stages of Vulval Cancer Stage 1a Wide local excision with a 1-cm margin is performed for the probable cure. Stage 1b Radical resection of the primary tumor and inguinofemoral lymphadenectomy (LAD). Central lesion: B/L LAD Lateral lesion (> 2 cm from midline): U/L LAD. Stage II Radical vulvectomy + B/L LAD Positive LN involvement in HPE - Must do pelvic LAD or pelvic LN radiotherapy. Stage III Radical partial or total vulvectomy and either SLNB or inguinofemoral lymphadenectomy. Postoperative adjuvant radiation (4000-5000 Rads over 5 weeks) directed to both the groins and the pelvis. Stage IV Treated with chemotherapy or radiotherapy Chemotherapy: 5-FU, mitomycin C Other agents used are Methotrexate, bleomycin, and trastuzumab. Vulval hematoma (Option C) is a collection of blood in the vulva that appears as a tense swelling with a dusky or purple discoloration, typically resulting from trauma.",

      "explanation": "Correct Answer: C) Green Explanation: In Colposcopy, a green (red-free) light filter is used to add contrast to aid vascular pattern visualization. Colposcopy is a diagnostic procedure in which a lighted magnifying instrument called a colposcope is used to examine the cervix, vagina, and vulva. The procedure is performed to evaluate patients with an abnormal Papanicolaou (Pap) test, those who test positive for high-risk human papillomavirus (HPV) DNA, or those with a suspicious appearing cervix, even if screening for dysplasia is negative. It may also be performed as a posttreatment follow-up of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) and invasive carcinoma. Black (Option A) : Black filter is not used in colposcopy as it restricts light and makes visualization difficult Red (Option B) : Red filter is not commonly used as it can alter the color perception of cervical tissue Yellow (Option D) : Yellow filter, while capable of enhancing certain tissue characteristics, is not typically preferred for routine examinations",

      "explanation": "Correct Answer: A) Ovary Explanation: The ovary is one of the most radiosensitive organs in the pelvic region. Gonadal toxicity following exposure to radiation therapy mainly involves a decline in the endocrine functions that sustain the production of sex hormones and germ cells. Pelvic radiotherapy results in ovarian injury and diminished follicle reserve; the extent of damage is largely based on the patient's age, treatment dose, and irradiation field. Vagina (Option B) , bladder (Option C) , and rectum (Option D) , are less radiosensitive compared to the ovaries. Although these organs may be exposed to radiation during treatment, the ovaries are typically the most affected and require careful consideration to minimize the potential long-term consequences of radiation exposure.

It does not predispose to malignancy or increase the risk of vulval cancer. Vulval cancer is a malignant tumor affecting the external female genitalia, most commonly the labia majora. Approximately 90% of vulval cancers are squamous cell carcinomas. Risk factors of vulval cancer Chronic Vulval Irritation Persistent irritation or inflammation (e.g., from infections or allergies) can cause cellular changes, increasing cancer risk.

Human Papillomavirus (HPV): HPV, a dsDNA virus, causes almost all cervical cancers. HPV vaccine is against L1 capsid protein. Viral replication is carried out by E1 and E2 protein It primarily infects human squamous cells or metaplastic epithelial cells. Clinically, HPV is divided into 2 types: Low-risk HPV (6 & 11) causes nearly all genital warts, and laryngeal papillomas and are rarely oncogenic. High-risk HPV (16 & 18) causes approximately 95% of cervical cancers . HPV 16 is the most oncogenic in high-risk HPV types. Screening for the BRCA gene (Option A) is done for breast and ovarian cancers as these are associated with BRCA gene mutations and not related to cervical cancers. Screening for the PTEN gene (Option C) is done for diseases associated with PTEN gene mutation, like Cowden syndrome, characterized by an increased risk of certain cancers, including breast, thyroid, and endometrial cancers.

      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer B - Chemotherapy followed by debulking The ovarian cancer in this scenario appears to be of a more advanced stage (stage 3) with ascites, and the most suitable treatment for such tumours is chemotherapy to shrink the tumour followed by a debulking surgery to remove the remaining tumour. Following primary debulking surgery, the standard first-line adjuvant chemotherapy regimen for epithelial ovarian cancer includes a combination of paclitaxel and carboplatin. Role of Neoadjuvant Chemotherapy (NACT): For patients with advanced ovarian cancer, especially those who may not be ideal candidates for immediate surgery due to extensive disease, neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NACT) is an option. NACT involves administering chemotherapy before surgical intervention. Given as 3 cycles before surgery and 3 cycles after surgery. It increases the chances of optimal debulking - This surgery after initial neoadjuvant chemotherapy is called interval debulking . Note: Women relapsing after 6 months of primary chemotherapy - Platinum-sensitive ovarian cancer Women relapsing within 6 months of primary chemotherapy - Platinum-resistant ovarian cancer Debulking followed by radiotherapy (Option A) sequence is not typically recommended as the primary approach. Debulking surgery is often performed after chemotherapy to remove as much tumour tissue as possible. Debulking followed by chemotherapy (Option C): While debulking surgery is an important component of treatment, initiating chemotherapy first is generally more effective in reducing the tumour burden before surgery. Radiotherapy followed by debulking (Option D): Radiotherapy is not a standard primary treatment for advanced ovarian cancer. Debulking surgery and chemotherapy are the mainstays of treatment, and radiation therapy may be considered in specific situations, but it is not typically the initial approach.

Granulosa Cell Tumors Incidence 70% of all ovarian sex cord tumours are granulosa cell tumors 2% of all ovarian neoplasms Types Adult form (95%) Juvenile form (5%) Characteristics Slow growing Solid or cystic or mixed The cut section shows yellow/orange due to lipid content HPE Appearance Round/polygonal cells with granular eosinophilic cytoplasm Coffee bean nuclei Call-Exner bodies (Pathognomonic) Hormonal Activity & Markers Secrete inhibin B, estrogen, and AMH Clinical Features Prior to puberty: Precocious puberty Childbearing period: Abnormal uterine bleeding Postmenopausal: Bleeding often with endometrial hyperplasia or adenocarcinoma Prognosis Good overall prognosis The 5-year survival rate for stage I disease is about 95% Dysgerminoma (Option A) is a rare malignant germ cell tumour of the ovary that often affects women of reproductive age. Dermoid (Option B) or teratoma forms from reproductive cells that make eggs in the ovary (germ cells). The cyst can contain tissue like hair, skin, or teeth. This type of cyst is rarely cancer. Brenner tumors (Option C) are rare ovarian neoplasms made of ovarian transition cells surrounded by dense fibrous tissue. Most of them are small tumors (<2 cm) detected incidentally in asymptomatic women.",
