      "question": "A 15-year-old girl child with primary amenorrhea and signs of virilisation. She has prepubertal development of breasts and pubic hair and is tanner stage 2. She has a blind-ended vagina and clitoromegaly with normal testosterone levels. Her genotype is 46 XY. What is the probable diagnosis?",
      "options": {
        "A": "17-hydroxylase deficiency",
        "B": "Swyer syndrome",
        "C": "5-alpha reductase deficiency",
        "D": "Complete AIS"
      },
      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Correct answer: C) 5-alpha reductase deficiency Explanation: The presentation of primary amenorrhea with virilisation, clitoromegaly, blind-ended vagina, and Tanner stage 2 pubic hair development, alongside a 46 XY genotype, suggests 5-alpha reductase deficiency. Definition: 5-alpha reductase deficiency is a condition with a deficiency in the enzyme 5-alpha reductase , which converts testosterone to dihydrotestosterone (DHT) . Features: DHT is crucial for the development of male external genitalia. Individuals with this deficiency typically have normal testosterone levels because the enzyme defect doesn't affect testosterone production. At birth, they are often assigned female because they have ambiguous genitalia or appear female externally. During puberty, testosterone levels increase, leading to virilization (e.g., clitoromegaly) They usually have a blind-ending vagina and often prepubertal breast development because DHT is important for male genital development but not for pubic hair development, which relies on testosterone. 17 hydroxylase deficiency (Option A) leads to impaired production of both sex steroids and cortisol, with accumulation of precursor steroids, leading to increased mineralocorticoid activity (hypertension and hypokalemia). Patients have ambiguous genitalia or female external genitalia due to low androgen levels, and the characteristic features include hypertension and hypokalemia. Normal testosterone levels would not be expected in 17 hydroxylase deficiency, which makes this option incorrect. Swyer syndrome (Option B) is a type of pure gonadal dysgenesis where individuals have a 46 XY karyotype but develop as females with streak gonads. They present with primary amenorrhea and underdeveloped secondary sexual characteristics (such as prepubertal breasts) and do not develop pubic hair due to a lack of sex steroid production, which is not the case given here. Complete AIS (Androgen Insensitivity Syndrome) (Option D) involves resistance to androgens in individuals with a 46 XY karyotype and typically have normal breast development due to aromatization of androgens to estrogens, no pubic or axillary hair (because of androgen resistance), and a blind-ending vagina. The presence of pubic hair and prepubertal breasts is not consistent with complete AIS Reference: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK539904/",

        "A": "Point mutation",
        "B": "Deletion",
        "C": "Translocation",
        "D": "Non-sense mutation"
      },
      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Correct answer: C) Translocation Explanation: In cases of gonadal sex reversal syndrome with an XX karyotype, the most common underlying cause is a translocation. Translocation refers to the rearrangement of chromosomal material between non-homologous chromosomes. Sex reversal syndrome, also known as disorder of sex development (DSD), occurs when there is a discrepancy between an individual's chromosomal, gonadal, and phenotypic sex. In the context of gonadal sex reversal syndrome with an XX karyotype, a translocation involving the SRY (Sex-determining Region Y) gene can result in its presence on an X chromosome. The SRY gene is responsible for initiating male development, so translocating to an X chromosome can lead to the development of testes instead of ovaries in individuals with an XX karyotype.

      "question": "A 17-year-old girl with a height of 155cm and weight of 48kgs presents with primary amenorrhea. She has not developed breasts or hair in the pubic or axillary regions and has bilateral inguinal masses. USG examination shows an absent uterus, fallopian tube, and ovary. What is the most likely diagnosis?",
      "options": {
        "A": "Hypergonadotropic hypogonadism",
        "B": "Complete androgen insensitivity syndrome",
        "C": "PCOS",
        "D": "Turner’s syndrome"
      },
      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "Correct answer: A) Hypergonadotropic hypogonadism The clinical scenario here is of a female with an absent uterus, breasts, and other structures with primary amenorrhea and inguinal masses (undescended testes) that suggests the XY karyotype thus leading to the diagnosis of hypergonadotropic hypogonadism. In individuals with the XY karyotype , a Mullerian-inhibiting substance is secreted from the Sertoli cells, which inhibits the development of the uterus, fallopian tubes, cervix, and upper vagina. This happens in XX individuals when there is Mullerian agenesis , but their ovaries are normal . The given scenario has no ovaries and can hence be confirmed to have the ‘Y’ chromosome, hence the XY karyotype. The conditions that can have the XY karyotype with features in the scenario (absent uterus, fallopian tubes, and ovaries) are hypergonadotropic hypogonadism (seen in XY and XX) and androgen insensitivity syndrome . The scenario also states that the individual has not developed breasts which is concurrent with the diagnosis of hypergonadotropic hypogonadism . Hypergonadotropic hypogonadism Aetiology: Usually seen in disorders with LH or hCG receptor mutations. Pathophysiology: It is an autosomal recessive 46, XY disorder where there are LH receptor mutations. This prevents the normal hormone binding and thus reduces the number or function of Leydig cells. This decreases fetal testosterone production and leads to the failure of normal male sexual differentiation. The lack of testosterone leads to impaired Wolfian duct development and failure of the development of male internal genitalia. This also leads to a lack of DHT which causes masculinization of the male external genitalia giving rise to female-looking external genitalia and undescended testes. Features: The anti-Mullerian hormone level is normal . (in XY karyotype and hence absent ovaries) Decreased testosterone leads to impaired Wolfian duct development and failure of testicular descent. Appear female at birth. Females at puberty present with primary amenorrhea. No breast and pubic hair development. Raised LH level but normal FSH levels. Complete androgen insensitivity syndrome (Option B) is an X-linked disorder where the androgen receptors are absent or scanty or fail to respond to testosterone. They may appear as female phenotypically at birth but with an XY karyotype. They usually present with primary amenorrhea and absent or scanty pubic hair development. But unlike hypergonadotropic hypogonadism, these individuals have normal well-developed breasts which is not the given scenario. Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) (Option C) is a common endocrine disorder characterized by hormonal imbalances, multiple cysts in the ovaries, and symptoms such as irregular periods, hirsutism (excessive hair growth), and acne. While PCOS can present with amenorrhea or irregular periods, the absence of a uterus, fallopian tubes, and ovaries on ultrasound examination is inconsistent with PCOS. Turner syndrome (Option D) is characterized by the absence of one X chromosome (45, X0 karyotype) in females, i.e., monosomy. These individuals do not develop ovaries and breasts or other secondary sexual characteristics. However, an individual with Turner’s syndrome does develop a uterus which is not the",

      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: B) Craniorachischisis Explanation: The given image shows a severe neural tube defect with exposure of both the brain and spinal cord, which is characteristic of craniorachischisis. Craniorachischisis: A severe neural tube defect where the closure defect of the neural tube extends from the cephalic region (anencephaly) into the spinal cord. Features: Anencephaly is present , with a large defect involving the spine. The vault of the skull and parts of the vertebral column are absent. Polyhydramnios occurs due to the absence of the swallowing reflex. Spina Bifida: A general term for neural tube defects (NTDs) affecting the spinal region, where the vertebral arches split. Types of spina bifida: Spina Bifida Occulta: A defect in the vertebral arches covered by skin, typically in the sacral region (S1-S2). Does not usually involve neural tissue and is often asymptomatic. May be marked by a patch of hair over the affected region but typically does not cause disability. Meningocele: A severe NTD where only the meninges (fluid-filled sacs) protrude through the defect. Myelomeningocele/Meningomyelocele: (Option A & C) A severe NTD where both meninges and neural tissue protrude through the defect , resulting in neurological deficits. Often found in the lumbosacral region. Rachischisis (Myeloschisis): (Option D) A severe form of spina bifida that involves significant neural tissue malformation. Occurs when the neural folds fail to elevate, leaving a flattened mass of neural tissue. This defect can occur in either the spinal cord or brain region. The exposed neural tissue becomes necrotic and deteriorates.",

        "B": "Turner's syndrome",

        "D": "Edward's syndrome"
      },
      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: A) Klinefelter's syndrome Explanation: Barr bodies are formed by the inactivation of one X chromosome in individuals with more than one X chromosome. The number of Barr bodies can be calculated as: Number of Barr bodies = Number of X chromosomes - 1. Individuals with Klinefelter syndrome have an extra X chromosome (47, XXY karyotype). The presence of two X chromosomes in a male results in the formation of one Barr body , despite the individual being genetically male (XY). This leads to a false positive Barr body, as it is not typically expected in males. Turner's syndrome (Option B): In Turner’s syndrome, there is only one X chromosome, and no Barr bodies are present. Down's syndrome (Option C): Down syndrome does not affect the number of X-chromosomes; a female with this syndrome will have one Barr body. This is because the human female has two X chromosomes. Edward's syndrome (Option D): Edwards syndrome is trisomy of chromosome 18 & does not affect the number of X-chromosomes. It is a disorder of a non-sex chromosome.

      "correct_answer": "D",
      "explanation": "Correct answer: D) 2,3 Explanation: Laparoscopy and Hysterosalpingogram (HSG) can be used to diagnose the unicornuate uterus. Unicornuate Uterus: Results from the incomplete development of one Müllerian duct while the other duct develops normally, leading to a single functioning uterine cavity. Diagnostic Evaluations: Ultrasound (USG): First-line imaging to detect uterine anomalies. Can identify associated abnormalities like ipsilateral renal agenesis, present in about 40% of cases. Saline Infusion Sonography (SIS): Enhances visualization of the uterine cavity for better evaluation of Müllerian anomalies. Hysterosalpingography (HSG): (3) Reveals a characteristic fusiform (banana-shaped) uterine cavity. The cavity typically tapers at the apex and connects to a single fallopian tube. The uterus may appear to be shifted from the midline. MRI: The preferred non-invasive modality for detailed assessment. Provides precise preoperative evaluation. Hysteroscopy/Laparoscopy: (2) Reserved for patients with complex uterine anomalies or those undergoing infertility evaluation. Allows direct visualization and confirmation of the diagnosis. X-ray (Option A) lacks the resolution and specificity required to evaluate uterine anomalies or fallopian tube pathology effectively. It has been replaced by advanced imaging modalities like HSG and laparoscopy. Falloposcopy (Option B & C) is a minimally invasive procedure that provides direct visualization of the fallopian tubes, particularly useful for identifying pathology at the cornual (proximal) and interstitial portions of the tube.",

      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "Correct answer: A) Mullerian agenesis Explanation: A girl with primary amenorrhea, normal secondary sexual characteristics, a blind-ending vagina, and an absent uterus most likely has Mullerian agenesis. Mullerian Agenesis/Mayer-Rokitansky-Küster-Hauser (MRKH) Syndrome: A developmental defect of the Müllerian ducts leading to congenital absence of the uterus, cervix, and upper vagina. Occurs in 1:5000–1:20,000 female births. Karyotype: 46, XX. Female phenotype with normal secondary sexual characteristics. Congenital absence of uterus and vagina (small rudimentary uterine bulbs are usually present). Normal ovarian function, including ovulation. Associated Anomalies: Skeletal abnormalities (20–30%). Urologic anomalies (40%) like kidney malrotation, ectopic kidney, or horseshoe kidney. Investigations: Ultrasound (pelvis, abdomen) for pelvic organs and kidneys. 3D ultrasound: 100% sensitive and specific. MRI: Used if further clarity is needed. X-ray (L-S spine) and descending pyelography for urinary tract anomalies. Laparoscopy: Avoided unless Müllerian remnants cause complications. Management: Non-Surgical Methods: Act by intermittent pressure on the perineum. Frank’s Method: Vaginal dilators, applied for 20 minutes thrice daily for 6–8 weeks. Surgical Options: McIndoe Vaginoplasty: Skin graft over a mould in a created vaginal space. Tissue Expansion Vaginoplasty: Use of a water balloon. Gonadal dysgenesis (Option B) is associated with an XY karyotype and rudimentary gonads, leading to poorly developed secondary sexual characteristics, such as underdeveloped breasts and female external genitalia. The girl, in this cas,e has normal breast and pubic hair development, making gonadal dysgenesis less likely. Turner syndrome (Option C) typically presents with short stature, webbed neck, and underdeveloped secondary sexual characteristics. Individuals have a 45,X karyotype, atrophic ovaries, and a non-palpable uterus. This girl, however, has normal breast and pubic hair development, ruling out Turner syndrome. Testicular feminization syndrome (Option D), also known as Androgen Insensitivity Syndrome (AIS), involves a 46,XY karyotype with resistance to androgens, resulting in female external genitalia but absent or sparse pubic and axillary hair. The girl here has normal pubic hair, making AIS unlikely. Reference: Shaws textbook of Gynaecology 17th Edition, Page 67-69",

MRKH (Mayer-Rokitansky-Kuster-Hauser) syndrome D) 46 + XX Turner's syndrome: Genetic condition where one of the X chromosomes is partially or completely missing ( 45,X0 ), leading to ovarian failure and hypogonadism. Affected individuals typically present with short stature, a webbed neck, low hairline, widely spaced nipples, and absent or poorly developed secondary sexual characteristics, including amenorrhea. Swyer syndrome (pure gonadal dysgenesis): Caused by mutations in the SRY gene, resulting in undeveloped gonads that cannot produce hormones or anti-Müllerian hormone (AMH). Patients appear phenotypically female with normal external genitalia and a uterus, but they experience primary amenorrhea and lack secondary sexual characteristics. Their dysgenetic gonads carry a risk of malignant transformation. This syndrome is male pseudohermaphroditism with pure 46 XY gonadal dysgenesis. Mayer-Rokitansky-Küster-Hauser (MRKH) syndrome: Characterized by the absence of the uterus, cervix, and upper vagina in females with a 46,XX karyotype , but the ovaries and external genitalia are normal. These individuals present with primary amenorrhea, as the uterus fails to develop. Complete androgen insensitivity syndrome (CAIS): Individuals with a 46,XY karyotype cannot respond to androgens due to defective androgen receptors, resulting in the development of female external genitalia and the absence of a uterus and cervix. They have normal breast development, primary amenorrhea, and may have inguinal swelling due to undescended testes.

      "correct_answer": "D",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: D) Transverse lie Explanation: Transverse lie is not a common complication of uterine didelphys. Uterine didelphys : Müllerian anomaly characterized by two separate uterine horns, each with its own endometrial cavity and cervix. It results from the failure of fusion of the paired Müllerian ducts. Pregnancies typically occur in one horn, with a higher frequency in the right (76%). It has a better reproductive prognosis due to improved blood supply or earlier diagnosis. Most women with uterine didelphys are asymptomatic but may experience dyspareunia, dysmenorrhea, or chronic abdominal pain, often due to an obstructing vaginal septum that causes hematocolpos or hematometrocolpos. Endometriosis (Option B) and genital neoplasms may rarely be reported in association with uterine didelphys. Complications associated with uterine didelphys include: Spontaneous abortion (Option A) Preterm labor (Option C) Cesarean delivery Fetal growth restriction Perinatal mortality Uterine didelphys can be diagnosed using invasive techniques like hysteroscopy, hysterosalpingography, or laparoscopy. However, MRI offers a noninvasive, equally accurate alternative and can also detect associated urinary tract abnormalities. Hysterosalpingography",

      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: B) Hysteroscopy + laparoscopy Explanation: In a young woman with infertility and a suggestive ultrasound finding of a uterine anomaly, \"Hysteroscopy + laparoscopy\" is the most appropriate diagnostic method. It allows direct visualization of the uterus and pelvic structures, confirms tubal patency through chromopertubation, and helps identify anatomical defects, lesions, or adhesions affecting fertility. Differentiating Bicornuate and Septate Uterus plays a crucial role in arriving at a diagnosis. 3D sonography and MRI provide accurate assessments. Gold standard- Hysteroscopy + Diagnostic Laparoscopy Hysterosalphingography (Option A) provides information about fallopian tube patency and the uterine cavity's interior contour but does not visualize uterine anomalies or assess the uterus exterior, making it less suitable for diagnosing uterine anomalies. Laparoscopy (Option C) can visualize pelvic organs but does not assess the interior contour of the uterine cavity, making it insufficient for confirming uterine anomalies. Transvaginal sonography (Option D) is often used as a screening tool for uterine anomalies but is not definitive for confirming the diagnosis, as it lacks the detail and accuracy of hysteroscopy and laparoscopy.

      "correct_answer": "D",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: D) Transcervical resection of septum Explanation: Transcervical Resection of Septum (TCRS) is a minimally invasive surgical procedure performed to remove the septum within the uterus. It is considered the gold standard treatment for a septate uterus. By removing the septum, TCRS improves the uterine anatomy and allows for better implantation and development of the fetus. This procedure has shown to significantly reduce the risk of recurrent pregnancy loss and improve obstetric outcomes, such as live birth rates and decreased rates of preterm labor and intrauterine growth restriction. Incorrect Options: Jones Metroplasty (Option A) is a surgical procedure performed to correct a T-shaped uterus. It involves reshaping the uterine cavity to a more normal shape. While it can improve the uterine anatomy, it may not be the optimal choice for a septate uterus. Septate uterus requires septum removal rather than reshaping. Strassmann Metroplasty (Option B) is a surgical procedure performed to correct a bicornuate uterus, which has a heart-shaped appearance. It involves resecting the septum that divides the uterus to create a single uterine cavity. This procedure is not suitable for a septate uterus as it focuses on correcting a different uterine anomaly. Tompkins Metroplasty (Option C) is another surgical procedure performed to correct a bicornuate uterus. It involves excising the septum and suturing the uterine walls to create a single cavity. Similar to Strassmann Metroplasty, this procedure is not specifically designed for a septate uterus. Reference: Williams Obstetrics, 26th Edition, Page 44, 45",
