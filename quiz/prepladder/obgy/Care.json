      "explanation": "woman. Correct Answer: B) The optimum weight gain during pregnancy is 10-12 kg for a normal BMI woman. Explanation: Pregnant women with a normal BMI (18.5–23 kg/m²) should aim to gain 10–12 kg. Underweight women (BMI <18.5 kg/m²) should increase their dietary intake and monitor their weight closely. Overweight (BMI 23–27.5 kg/m²) and obese women (BMI >27.5 kg/m²) should limit weight gain to 5–9 kg. During pregnancy, there is an increased need for calories and nutrients to support both the mother's health and the growth and development of the fetus due to: Maternal Tissue Growth Increased Metabolic Rate Nutrient Transfer to Fetus Preparation for Lactation Nutrition requirements: Calories During pregnancy + 350 kcal (Option A ruled out) During lactation +600Kcal in first 6 months of lactation(1-6M) +520Kcal in the next 6 months of lactation (7-12M) The recommended daily allowance (RDA) of iron for pregnant women is 27 milligrams, and for lactating women, 9 milligrams (Option C ruled out) .

      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: A) 1 and 4 Explanation: In the given clinical scenario abrupt stopping of antiepileptic drugs when once used in pregnancy is not recommended due to the high risk to the fetus due to uncontrolled seizures which result in anoxia and intellectual disability. Antiepileptic has to be continued, and then the dose can be tapered slowly if there are no episodes of seizures. Management of seizures in pregnancy If the patient has had a history of seizures and is on any antiepileptic drug, the same prescribed drug is continued. If the first episode occurs during pregnancy, the drug preferred is either Lamotrigine or Levetiracetam. Folic acid ( 4mg/day ) should be given to all. No anti-epileptic drug is deemed safe in pregnancy. So, it is important to have the patient on monotherapy at the lowest effective dose, especially during the first trimester.

      },
      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: A) Leopold's maneuver Explanation: Leopold's maneuver involves a sequence of palpations to determine the position of the fetus and its parts in the uterus . It is commonly used to confirm the fetal position and presentation during pregnancy by systematically assessing the fundal height, location of the fetal back, presenting part, and cephalic prominence or breech presentation. Leopold's Maneuver Position Technique Purpose Fundal Grip (First Leopold) Facing the patient’s face Palpate the fundal area with both hands Determine which fetal pole is in the fundus Broad, soft, irregular mass: Breech Smooth, hard, globular mass: Head Transverse lie: Neither pole palpable Lateral or Umbilical Grip (Second Leopold) Facing the patient’s face Place hands flat on either side of the umbilicus, palpate one side at a time Identify the position of the fetal back, limbs, and anterior shoulder Back: Smooth, curved, resistant Limb side: Comparatively empty with small, knob-like parts Anterior shoulder: Prominent in the lower part of the uterus above the head Pawlik’s Grip (Third Leopold) Facing the patient’s face Place thumb and four fingers over the lower pole of the uterus, ulnar border on the upper symphysis pubis Grasp the presenting part if not engaged and test its mobility Transverse lie: Pawlik’s grip is empty Pelvic Grip (Fourth Leopold) Facing the patient’s feet Place four fingers of both hands on either side of the midline in the lower pole of the uterus, pressing downward and backward Identify the part in the lower pole, its attitude, and engagement Head Characteristics: Precise presenting area Attitude (position of sinciput and occiput) Engagement (noted by the presence/absence of sinciput and occiput, convergence/divergence of finger tips) Pinard maneuver (Option B): Pinard’s maneuver (Frank breech extraction) is done by intrauterine manipulation to convert a frank breech to a footling breech.

      "question": "A 28-year-old pregnant woman at 33 weeks gestation presents for a routine prenatal visit. She reports decreased fetal movements over the past two days. She has a history of gestational diabetes, and her pregnancy has been otherwise uneventful. The doctor decides to perform antepartum fetal surveillance. Which of the following is the most appropriate initial test to assess the fetal well-being in this scenario?",
      "options": {
        "A": "Amniotic fluid index",
        "B": "Biophysical profile",
        "C": "Contraction Stress test",
        "D": "Non-Stress test"
      },
      "correct_answer": "D",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: D) Non-Stress test Explanation: The NST is a noninvasive, quick, and reliable method for assessing fetal heart rate response to fetal movements, which is crucial given the reported decrease in fetal movements. During an NST, the mother is placed in a comfortable position, and external monitors are attached to her abdomen to record the fetal heart rate and any fetal movements for 20-30 minutes. A reactive NST (presence of accelerations in fetal heart rate with movements) indicates good fetal health, while a non-reactive NST (lack of sufficient accelerations) may necessitate further testing or intervention. Antepartum fetal surveillance: Fetal movement Maternal observation and recording of fetal movements to assess fetal well-being and activity levels. Non-stress test (NST) Monitors fetal heart rate acceleration in response to fetal movements to assess fetal well-being. Biophysical profile (BPP) (Option B ruled out) Assesses fetal well-being based on fetal heart rate accelerations, fetal movements, muscle tone, breathing movements, and amniotic fluid volume Doppler velocimetry Uses ultrasound to assess blood flow in fetal vessels like umbilical artery, middle cerebral artery (MCA), and ductus venosus, aiding in the evaluation of fetal well-being and placental function Amniotic fluid index (AFI) (Option A ruled out) Measures the depth of amniotic fluid to assess fetal well-being and detect potential complications like oligohydramnios or polyhydramnios Contraction stress test (CST) (Option C ruled out) Evaluates fetal heart rate response to uterine contractions to assess fetal well-being and uteroplacental function under controlled stress conditions. BPP, CST, and AFI are not the initial tests that are performed as they are either invasive ( CST) or time-consuming ( BPP ) or do not properly tell us about fetal movements( AFI ).

        "C": "Hand held doppler",
        "D": "Non-Stress Test"
      },
      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: C) Hand held doppler Explanation: Hand held doppler is the most appropriate method for monitoring fetal heart sounds at 24 weeks of gestation. Hand held doppler is capable of detecting fetal heart sounds as early as 10-12 weeks of gestation and is widely used during routine prenatal visits throughout pregnancy. It is non-invasive, safe, easy to use, and provides immediate feedback on fetal heart rate and well-being. Hand held doppler Detect and amplify fetal heart sounds, typically starting around 10-12 weeks of gestation Fetoscope A specialized stethoscope designed for listening directly to fetal heart sounds through the maternal abdomen, usually used after 18-20 weeks of gestation. Electronic Fetal Monitoring (EFM) Continuous or intermittent electronic monitoring of fetal heart rate and uterine contractions during labor using external or internal sensors Fetal Phonocardiography A method that records and analyzes fetal heart sounds to assess cardiac function and detect abnormalities, sometimes used in research or specialized clinical settings. Although Fetoscope (Option A) is used from 18 weeks gestation onwards, it’s less commonly used compared to doppler. EFM (Option B) is typically reserved for continuous monitoring during labor or in high-risk pregnancies where detailed and continuous assessment of fetal heart rate and uterine contractions is needed.It’s not practical for prenatal visits with healthy fetal movements. NST (Option D) is not typically used as a primary method for routine monitoring of fetal heart sounds at 24 weeks without any specific concerns.

      "question": "A 28-year-old pregnant woman presents for her first prenatal visit. Her last menstrual period (LMP) was recorded as February 15, 2024. She reports regular 28-day menstrual cycles. What is her estimated delivery date (EDD)?",

        "D": "November 1, 2024"
      },
      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: A) November 22, 2024 Explanation: EDD in this scenario: February 15 (LMP) + 7 days - 3 months = November 22, 2024. Calculation of the expected date of delivery (EDD) is done according to Naegele's formula by adding 7 days to the first day of the last period and subtracting 3 months or by adding 9 months and 7 days to the first day of the last menstrual period. Note: In longer interval cycles (>28 days), extra days are to be added while, in shorter interval (<28 days) cycles, lesser days are subtracted to get the EDD. Pregnancies conceived by assisted reproductive technologies (IVF) date of LMP is 14 days prior to date of embryo transfers (266 days).
