      "question": "A 32-year-old woman with a history of polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is evaluated at a fertility clinic due to difficulty conceiving. A transvaginal ultrasound shows a follicle with a large fluid-filled antrum and a well-defined cumulus oophorus. Which stage of follicle maturation does this represent?",
      "options": {
        "A": "Primary follicle",
        "B": "Secondary follicle",
        "C": "Primordial follicle",
        "D": "Graafian follicle"
      },
      "correct_answer": "D",
      "explanation": "Correct answer: D) Graafian follicle Explanation: The Graafian follicle (Mature Follicle) is the final stage before ovulation. It is characterised by a large fluid-filled antrum and a well-defined cumulus oophorus surrounding the oocyte. This stage indicates that the follicle is fully mature and ready to release the oocyte during ovulation. Primordial Follicle (Option C): The initial stage where follicles are in a dormant state . These consist of a primary oocyte surrounded by a single layer of squamous granulosa cells. Primary Follicle (Option A): The primordial follicle matures into a primary follicle where the granulosa cells become cuboidal, and the zona pellucida forms around the oocyte. Secondary Follicle (Option B): The primary follicle grows larger, forming multiple layers of granulosa cells, and small fluid-filled spaces begin to appear. The theca interna and externa layers develop around the follicle. Tertiary Follicle (Antral Follicle): The secondary follicle further develops as the fluid-filled spaces coalesce to form an antrum . The granulosa cells form the cumulus oophorus surrounding the oocyte.",

      "question": "A 35-year-old woman successfully undergoes in vitro fertilisation (IVF) and has surplus embryos after the embryo transfer. What is the standard duration and method for storing these embryos?",
      "options": {
        "A": "Stored indefinitely in liquid nitrogen",
        "B": "Stored for up to 10 years in liquid nitrogen",
        "C": "Stored for up to 5 years at room temperature",
        "D": "Stored indefinitely at room temperature"
      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: B) Stored for up to 10 years in liquid nitrogen Explanation: After IVF , surplus embryos can be cryopreserved for future use. The standard practice is to store embryos in liquid nitrogen. Embryos can typically be stored in liquid nitrogen for 5-10 years . This duration allows couples sufficient time to use these embryos for subsequent cycles or decisions. Cryopreservation Techniques : Slow Freezing uses lower concentrations of cryoprotectants, which is more time-consuming. Vitrification uses high-concentration cryoprotectants for rapid cooling, which is less expensive. It also has higher post-thaw embryo survival (93% vs. 76% with slow freezing). Stored indefinitely in liquid nitrogen (Option A): While embryos can be stored for a long time in liquid nitrogen, there are usually legal and ethical limits on storage duration. Stored for up to 5 years at room temperature (Option C): Embryos cannot be stored at room temperature as it would compromise their viability. Cryopreservation in liquid nitrogen is essential to maintain their integrity. Stored indefinitely at room temperature (Option D): Storage at room temperature would lead to the deterioration of embryos. Liquid nitrogen ensures stable and long-term preservation. Reference: 1.

      "question": "A 30-year-old woman with a history of pelvic inflammatory disease comes to the clinic with complaints of difficulty conceiving for 2 years. A hysterosalpingogram shows no dye leakage from her fallopian tubes, and her partner's semen analysis is normal. What is the most appropriate treatment option for this couple?",
      "options": {
        "A": "Clomiphene citrate",
        "B": "Intrauterine insemination",
        "C": "In vitro fertilisation",
        "D": "Laparoscopy"
      },
      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: C) In vitro fertilisation Explanation: In vitro fertilization is the preferred treatment option as it bypasses the blocked tubes, the highest success rate for tubal factor infertility. In Vitro Fertilisation: Injections of FSH (15 times the normal dose) are administered to recruit more follicles and increase the number of eggs. Using a transvaginal probe, a needle is inserted into the follicles. Oocytes are aspirated and transferred into a test tube, and sperm are inserted. Embryos are formed and are transferred back to the uterine cavity. Pregnancy is achieved through in vitro fertilisation. Indications Ideal Candidates for IVF Tubal blockage or absence Unexplained infertility Endometriosis Oligospermia or azoospermia Advanced reproductive age Fertility preservation Multiple infertility factors (both male and female) Failed ovulation induction Ovarian failure (donor oocyte IVF) Women with normal ovaries but no functional uterus (Müllerian agenesis) Women with genetic risk. Age below 35 years Presence of ovarian reserve (day 3 serum FSH level less than 10 IU/L) Male partner with normal seminogram Negative screening for HIV and hepatitis in both partners Normal uterine cavity as assessed by hysteroscopy or sonohysterography. Clomiphene citrate (Option A) is used to induce ovulation but is not effective for tubal blockage. Intrauterine insemination (Option B) requires at least one open fallopian tube, unsuitable for bilateral blockage. Laparoscopy (Option D) is a diagnostic/surgical tool, not a direct treatment for achieving pregnancy. Reference: 1. Berek and Novak’s Gynecology, 16th Edition, Page 2337, 2369 2.

        "D": "Contraceptive Patch"
      },
      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: A) Combined Oral Contraceptives ( COCs) Explanation: Combined Oral Contraceptives (POPs), thin the endometrial lining, preventing its build-up. This results in lighter menstrual periods and is an effective mechanism for reducing heavy menstrual bleeding. Hence, it is the first-line agent used in heavy menstrual bleeding. Progesterone is prescribed to control abnormal bleeding, as it has fewer withdrawal effects and stabilises the endometrium. If progesterone is ineffective, estrogen is given to prevent excessive bleeding. Progesterone-only pills (Option B) are used in the treatment of heavy bleeding & dysmenorrhea. It is the drug of choice for lactating women. Copper-containing Intrauterine Device (IUD) (Option C) are contraindicated in heavy menstrual bleeding as they are known to cause heavy menstrual bleeding. Contraceptive patch (Option D) can also be effective in managing menstrual bleeding, but progesterone-only pills are used as the first-line agents.

      "question": "A 30-year-old woman is trying to conceive and is tracking her ovulation. She notices changes in her cervical mucus throughout her menstrual cycle. What role does cervical mucus play during ovulation and the luteal phase of the menstrual cycle?",
      "options": {
        "A": "Ovulation: mucus thick and sticky; luteal phase: thinner mucus.",
        "B": "Ovulation: thin, clear, stretchy mucus; luteal phase: thick mucus.",
        "C": "The mucus is consistent in texture and volume throughout the cycle.",
        "D": "Ovulation: less mucus; luteal phase: more mucus."
      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: B) Ovulation: thin, clear, stretchy mucus; luteal phase: thick mucus. Explanation: Cervical mucus becomes thin, clear, and stretchy during ovulation , helping sperm travel through the cervix to reach the egg. During the luteal phase , progesterone makes the mucus thicker and less permeable, helping prevent sperm from entering the cervix and acting as a natural contraceptive. Cervical Mucus: Maximum stretchability on the 14th day of ovulation, known as spinnbarkeit. Dry: Ferning (Under microscope) due to sodium chloride crystals. Ovulation on 14th-day ↓ Cervical mucus is thin and watery, which helps in sperm transport. ↓ After ovulation ↓ Increase in progesterone ↓ Thick cervical mucus ↓ Transport of sperm is prevented. Ovulation: mucus thick and sticky; luteal phase: thinner mucus (Option A): Cervical mucus becomes thin and stretchy during ovulation to aid sperm movement. Progesterone in the luteal phase makes the mucus thicker, not thinner. The mucus is consistent in texture and volume throughout the cycle (Option C): Cervical mucus changes throughout the menstrual cycle, becoming more conducive to sperm movement during ovulation and less so during the luteal phase. Ovulation: less mucus; luteal phase: more mucus (Option D): Cervical mucus increases in quantity and becomes more conducive to sperm movement during ovulation, not dry and impeding. Progesterone makes the mucus thicker and less permeable during the luteal phase, not increasing its production. Reference: William’s Textbook of Obstetrics, 26th Edition, Page 675",

      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "progesterone for endometrial support. Correct Answer: B) Early Pregnancy Function: Maintains corpus luteum, which secretes progesterone for endometrium support. Explanation: The primary role of beta-hCG in early pregnancy is to maintain the corpus luteum , which secretes progesterone , which is essential for maintaining the endometrium and supporting early pregnancy until the placenta takes over progesterone production. Human Chorionic Gonadotropin: Beta-hCG is primarily produced by the syncytiotrophoblast cells of the placenta, not the maternal ovaries. Its levels typically peak around 8-11 weeks of gestation. (Option A is ruled out) The placenta takes over progesterone production around 8-10 weeks of gestation. (Option C is ruled out) . Beta-hCG levels typically start to decline after the first trimester. Beta-hCG levels double approximately every 48-72 hours during the early weeks of pregnancy but do not continue to do so throughout the entire pregnancy. (Option D is ruled out) The doubling rate slows down after the first trimester.",

Estrogen Effect : Promotes superficial cell maturation : Results in large, thin, eosinophilic cells with pyknotic nuclei (cornified cells). Background : Remains clear. 2. Progesterone Effect (Option A) : Promotes intermediate cell maturation : Leads to basophilic cells with vesicular nuclei. Background : Appears \"dirty.\" 3. Other Hormonal Effects : Androgens, corticosteroids, birth control pills, and pregnancy also cause intermediate cell maturation . 4. Lack of Hormonal Activity : Results in parabasal cell dominance , with small, round, basophilic cells. Luteinizing hormone (LH) (Option C) is primarily involved in triggering ovulation.

      "explanation": "Correct Answer: D) 200 - 250 Explanation: Throughout a woman's menstrual life (from puberty to menopause), approximately 1,000 primordial follicles are lost each month , although typically only one egg matures and is ovulated per cycle. Therefore from 12 yrs (puberty) to 32 yrs, the no. of eggs utilized = 20yrs(32-12yrs) × 12 eggs (1 per cycle) = 240 eggs Thus, between the ages of 12 (puberty) and 32, a cumulative total of 240 eggs were utilized during menstruation, 200-250 approx. Stage Number of Follicles/Eggs 8th week of IUL Follicles begin to form 20 weeks of IUL 6-7 million follicles (Maximum) At Birth 1-2 million follicles At puberty 400,000 follicles During childbearing age for ovulation/fertilization 400-500 eggs in life Follicular atresia is precisely controlled by apoptosis , which is regulated by hormones.

Skene's glands , or paraurethral glands , are located near the urethral opening in females. They can become infected, leading to conditions like skenitis or paraurethral abscesses. Symptoms include lower urinary tract symptoms, dyspareunia, and dysuria. Diagnosis often requires imaging to detect fluid-filled masses or abscesses. Treatment typically involves antibiotics and drainage of the abscess if necessary. Bartholin's glands (Option B) are located near the vaginal opening and are responsible for secreting fluid that helps lubricate the vagina. Infection of Bartholin's glands typically presents with swelling and pain in the lower part of the labia majora, not around the urethra. Sebaceous glands (Option C) secrete sebum and are distributed throughout the skin, including the genital area, but do not typically present as urethritis.

It indicates ovulation when the follicle size increases from 15mm to 20mm and then shrinks. Serum LH = 40mIU/ml (Option C): Serum LH levels in the range of 35-50 mIU/ml indicate that ovulation has occurred. Diagnostic laparoscopy showed a yellow punctum on the ovary (Option D) indicates the presence of corpus luteum, which signifies that ovulation has occurred.

      "correct_answer": "D",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: D) Luteinizing hormone (LH) Explanation: Hormone Role in Menstrual Cycle Luteinizing Hormone (LH) (Option D) Triggers ovulation approximately 12-36 hours after surge. Regulated by sex hormone feedback mechanisms. Estrogen (Option A) Promotes growth and maturation of ovarian follicles during follicular phase. Thickens endometrium for implantation. Progesterone (Option B) It supports the luteal phase post-ovulation and prepares the uterus for potential implantation but does not initiate ovulation. Follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) (Option C) Stimulates recruitment and initial growth of ovarian follicles. Induces estrogen (estradiol) production to support follicular development.

      "question": "A 26-year-old female is unable to conceive after 2 years of regular intercourse. She tracks her menstrual cycles regularly and notes consistent 28-day cycles. Her husband's semen analysis came out to be normal. Which of the following is the best indicator of the ovulatory cycle?",

      },
      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: C) Progesterone Explanation: Progesterone levels on day 21 of the menstrual cycle are the best hormonal indicator for ovulation. Levels greater than 3 ng/ml on day 21 confirm ovulation. Rise in Basal body temperature (Option A) : It rises by approximately 0.4° to 0.8°F under the influence of progesterone. There is a biphasic pattern of temperature variation in the ovulatory cycle. In anovulation, there is no rise in temperature during the second half of the menstrual cycle. This method can predict ovulation but is not accurate. Cervical mucus study (Option B) : The disappearance of ferning in cervical mucus after the 22nd day, under the influence of progesterone, suggests ovulation, but it is not confirmatory. Estrogen (Option D) level peaks 24 hours before LH surge and 24-36 hrs before ovulation. LH and estrogen are used for in vitro fertilisation studies. Reference: 1.

      "question": "A 26-year-old primigravida at 40 weeks of gestation presents with severe labour pains for the past 12 hours. On examination, the fetal head is at 0 stations, the vitals are normal, and there is no further descent despite strong uterine contractions.

      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: B) Pathological retraction ring Explanation: The given clinical scenario of an obstructed labour and vaginal examination revealing a constriction at the isthmus of the uterus is indicative of a pathological retraction ring , also known as Bandl's ring , which is an abnormal constriction that forms at the junction of the upper and lower uterine segments during prolonged and obstructed labour. Pathological Retraction Ring: Occurs due to prolonged tetanic uterine contractions, often in obstructed labour , where the lower uterine segment is markedly constricted. This can impede fetal descent and cause significant labour complications. Clinical features include severe pain, restlessness, maternal exhaustion, and abdominal tenderness. Physiological ring of the isthmus (Option A) refers to a normal anatomical structure that does not cause obstruction or significant labour complications. Cervical stenosis (Option C) is often due to scarring, surgery, or radiation. While it can cause difficulty in labour, it usually presents earlier and is less likely to be associated with a ring-like constriction felt at the isthmus. Cervical dystocia (Option D) refers to difficult or abnormal dilation of the cervix during labour. While cervical dystocia can lead to prolonged labour and failure to progress, it typically refers to cervical dilation rather than a constriction at the isthmus of the uterus.

      "explanation": "Correct Answer: B) An anteverted uterus tilts toward the bladder in a sagittal section. Explanation: The uterus typically lies in anteversion and anteflexion . In a sagittal section, an anteverted uterus tilts forward toward the bladder. The uterus's body bends forward on the cervix at approximately the level of the internal os; this forward inclination constitutes anteflexion. The uterus is typically anteverted ; the body of the uterus is tilted forward , leaning towards the bladder. (Option A ruled out) The retroverted uterus is tilted backwards . The body of the uterus leans toward the sacrum when it is retroverted. (Option C & D ruled out)",
