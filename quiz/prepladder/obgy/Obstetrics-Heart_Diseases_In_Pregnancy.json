      "explanation": "ASD is a true hole in atrial septum, and secundum type defects account for 70%. Most ASD are asymptomatic till the 3rd/4th decade of life. Pregnancy with an unrepaired ASD is well tolerated until and unless pulmonary hypertension develops. The risk of ASD-related stroke is higher in pregnant women than in nonpregnant women. TOF (Option A) is the most common cyanotic heart disease seen in pregnancy. TOF includes large VSD, pulmonary stenosis, right ventricular hypertrophy and overriding aorta. Mitral stenosis (Option B&D) is the most common acquired valvular disease in pregnancy. Mitral valve prolapse-associated mitral stenosis is the most common congenital valvular disease in pregnancy. These conditions lead to heart failure from fluid overload.

      "explanation": "The best initial management for this condition is furosemide and monitoring fluid intake. Heart failure in pregnancy: The onset is most likely in the 2nd/3rd trimester and in peripartum. Clinical features: Symptoms: Dyspnea is most common. Other symptoms include orthopnea, palpitations, nocturnal cough and sudden decline in activity. Signs: Progressive edema, tachypnea, tachycardia, jugular venous distension, hemoptysis. Investigations : Serum BNP levels are elevated. X-ray: Cardiomegaly and pulmonary edema (hallmark features) Echocardiogram: Reduced ejection fraction (<45%) Treatment : Initial management: Diuretics and fluid restriction (Option B) Beta-blocker: Lowers cardiac mortality. Carvedilol is most commonly used in pregnancy. Digoxin, as a last resort, provides an inotropic effect and reduces hospitalizations. For patients with chronic heart failure, the risk of thromboembolism is increased. Therefore, prophylactic heparin should be given. Beta-blockers (Option A) such as carvedilol can be given to patients with acute heart failure, but this is not the initial management, and complete bed rest increases the risk of thromboembolism in pregnant women. ACE inhibitors (Option C) are contraindicated in pregnant women because of their effect on fetal kidneys. Immediate delivery of the fetus (Option D) is not indicated unless there is fetal distress or when medical management is not sufficient. Reference: William 26e, pg no: 921-922",

      "explanation": "pregnancy increases the risk of aortic dissection in women with coarctation of the aorta, and the risk is further elevated during labor and delivery. An aortic root diameter > 4.5 cm poses a significant risk of dissection and rupture, which is often fatal. Cesarean Section in Heart Disease Indications Explanation Aortic root dilatation: > 4 cm Increases the risk of aortic dissection. (Option A) (Option B &D) Aortic Aneurysms Coarctation of the Aorta Severe Aortic Stenosis Have a fixed cardiac output, making them vulnerable to hemodynamic changes during labor. Recent MI Physiological stress of labor and delivery might be too much for a heart recently recovering from an MI, causing increased complications. Congestive Heart Failure With limited cardiac reserve, the stress of labor could precipitate a cardiac decompensation event. However, aggressive medical stabilization of pulmonary edema is preferred, followed by vaginal delivery if feasible. NYHA Class III or IV Limitations on physical activity. Labor is strenuous and could lead to serious complications. Warfarin use in last 2 weeks Due to the risk of fetal intracerebral hemorrhage, as the fetal liver requires up to two weeks to metabolize warfarin. Need for emergency valve replacement immediately after delivery Due to the high risk of hemodynamic instability and cardiac decompensation during labor in patients with severe valve disease. (Option C) Aortic dissection can occur suddenly without warning signs. Waiting for signs before performing a Cesarean section risks a catastrophic event.

      "explanation": "preload, potentially leading to heart failure. Labor management in heart disease: Vaginal delivery is preferred for most with heart disease, and labor induction is generally safe. However, cesarean delivery is considered for specific cardiac lesions. Neuraxial anesthesia is preferred for both vaginal and cesarean deliveries in cardiac patients. Epidural analgesia is the preferred method for pain management during labor in women with heart disease. (Option B). Management of fluid levels during labor depends on the specific heart condition: \"Dry\" management (restricting IV fluids) is recommended for women with mitral stenosis. An abrupt increase in preload during uterine contractions can cause pulmonary edema. \"Wet\" management (ensuring adequate intravascular volume) is recommended for women with aortic stenosis to maintain cardiac output and systemic perfusion. A sudden decrease in preload could cause hypotension, syncope, myocardial infarction, or death. Positioning during labor is important. Women with significant heart disease should be kept in a semi-recumbent position with a lateral tilt. Close monitoring is crucial throughout labor and delivery - look out for signs of impending ventricular failure. Oxytocin can be used for labor induction and augmentation , but it should be administered through an infusion pump rather than IV fluid bottles. IV or IM oxytocin for postpartum hemorrhage prevention , as it is the drug of choice Straining during the second stage of labor should be minimized. Forceps or vacuum extraction might be used to shorten this stage. Immediately after delivery, administer furosemide to reduce preload. Avoid using methyl ergometrine for postpartum hemorrhage prevention, as it can suddenly increase preload, potentially leading to heart failure. Continue close observation in a high-risk ward for 24 hours postpartum and discharge after 5–7 days. The 4th stage of labor (the first 24 hours after delivery) is particularly critical for women with heart disease. (Option A): Supplemental oxygen is routinely administered during labor in women with cardiac conditions to maintain adequate oxygenation. (Option D): Percutaneous mitral balloon valvuloplasty is a procedure considered safe and effective for women with symptomatic severe mitral stenosis during pregnancy. (Option D) Intravenous fluid boluses should be avoided or used very cautiously in women with mitral stenosis due to the risk of increasing preload and precipitating pulmonary edema.Women with mitral stenosis are best managed \"on the dry side\" during labor.

Regular follow-up allows for early detection and management of any arising issues. Delayed complications of heart disease in pregnancy Complications Management Cardiac Rupture Planned non-invasive surgery like balloon mitral valvotomy for mitral stenosis, preferably done in the second trimester, can help prevent heart failure. Infective Endocarditis Avoid contact with people with respiratory infections. Administer pneumococcal vaccination if not already administered, and yearly influenza vaccination. Thromboembolic Phenomenon Low molecular weight heparin anticoagulation when the ejection fraction is 30-35% due to the increased risk of left ventricular thrombi. Mitral Valve Prolapse Continuous routine monitoring and follow-up. Arrhythmias Continue beta-blockers, preferably propranolol, throughout pregnancy and the postpartum period to lower the risk of torsades de pointes. Postpartum Heart Failure Keep the patient in a high-risk ward or ICU for observation for the first 24 hours and administer furosemide immediately after delivery to decrease preload on the heart. Percutaneous balloon valvuloplasty (Option B) is a viable option for symptomatic mitral stenosis during pregnancy; it is not routinely performed postpartum in asymptomatic patients Anticoagulation (Option C) is crucial for patients with mechanical valves and is not routinely indicated unless there is a history of atrial fibrillation or prior thromboembolic events.

      "explanation": "Correct answer: D) Switch to LMWH now and transition to warfarin in the second trimester. thromboembolism, but anticoagulation is vital for women with mechanical heart valves to prevent valve thrombosis. Warfarin is teratogenic, potentially causing miscarriages, stillbirths, and a constellation of birth defects known as fetal warfarin syndrome. (Option A) Heparin, in both unfractionated (UFH) and low-molecular-weight (LMWH) forms, is considered safer for the fetus during pregnancy as it does not cross the placenta. UFH, even at full anticoagulation doses, is considered inadequate for preventing valve thrombosis in pregnant women with mechanical heart valves. (Option B) LMWH is associated with a lower risk of valve thrombosis compared to UFH, making it a preferred choice for many pregnant women requiring anticoagulation. A common approach is to start LMWH during the first trimester to minimize fetal risks, then switch to warfarin after the first trimester for better valve thrombosis protection. Near term, warfarin is discontinued to reduce bleeding risks during labor, then restarted shortly after delivery. (Option C) (Option D) Regular monitoring of anticoagulation levels (INR for warfarin, anti-Xa levels for LMWH) is essential. Reference: Williams Obstetrics, 26th Edition, Page 922,923",

      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "consistent with peripartum cardiomyopathy. Peripartum Cardiomyopathy (PPCM) PPCM is a form of nonischemic dilated cardiomyopathy linked to pregnancy, sharing a genetic predisposition with familial and sporadic idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy. Diagnostic Criteria (Pearson, 2000) Development of cardiac failure in the last month of pregnancy or within 5 months postpartum. Absence of an identifiable cause for the cardiac failure. No recognizable heart disease prior to the last month of pregnancy. Left ventricular systolic dysfunction (depressed ejection fraction, fractional shortening, and dilated left ventricle). Etiology and Pathophysiology Causes include viral myocarditis, abnormal immune response, hemodynamic stress, hormonal interactions, malnutrition, inflammation, and apoptosis. Two-hit hypothesis: PPCM affects genetically susceptible women with cardiac gene mutations (e.g., TTNC1, TTN, STAT3). Prolactin: High prolactin levels from the maternal pituitary and sFlt-1 from the placenta lead to myocardial damage. 16-kDa prolactin fragment (vasoinhibin): Causes myocardial damage. sFlt-1: Elevated in women with preeclampsia and multifetal pregnancy, exacerbates PPCM. Treatment Bromocriptine: Inhibits prolactin secretion; preliminary studies support its use. Breastfeeding can be encouraged for mothers with PPCM as it does not impact their LVEF. Hypertensive heart failure (Option A) is typically associated with long-standing hypertension and not not present acutely like in this scenario. Viral myocarditis (Option C) is less commonly associated with recent childbirth and would not typically be related to the history of multiple gestation and preeclampsia Idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy (Option D) is a diagnosis of exclusion and is not specifically associated with recent pregnancy Reference: Williams 26ed Pg 932-933",

      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "β -blocker therapy sodium restriction: Helps to prevent fluid retention and pulmonary congestion. β -blocker therapy: Slows the heart rate, reducing the mitral gradient and preventing tachycardia-induced pulmonary edema. Mitral Stenosis Cause: Mainly due to rheumatic endocarditis. Mitral Valve Surface Area: Normal is 4.0 cm²; symptoms usually develop when narrowed to <2.5 cm². Fixed cardiac output may lead to ventricular failure and pulmonary edema during pregnancy. Symptoms include dyspnea, fatigue, palpitations, cough, and hemoptysis. Atrial tachyarrhythmias, including fibrillation, are common and predispose to mural thrombus formation and cerebrovascular embolization. Complications: Complications are directly related to the degree of valvular stenosis. Women with a mitral valve area <2 cm² are at greatest risk. Severe stenosis: Half develop heart failure, and there is increased fetal growth restriction. Management: Limited physical activity is recommended. Symptoms of pulmonary congestion: Reduce activity, restrict dietary sodium, and administer diuretics. Beta-blockers to slow ventricular response; IV verapamil or electrocardioversion for new-onset atrial fibrillation. Chronic fibrillation is managed with digoxin, beta-blockers, or calcium channel blockers. (Option C) Anticoagulation for persistent fibrillation, left atrial thrombus, or history of embolism.

      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "intervention (PCI) initial treatment should include aspirin and heparin to manage the thrombosis, followed by percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) to revascularize the affected coronary artery. PCI is the preferred method as it is effective and safe during pregnancy. Acute Coronary Syndrome in Pregnancy: Causes of acute MI in pregnancy include coronary artery atherosclerosis, dissection, embolism, spasm, or arteritis. Those experiencing MI within two weeks of delivery face increased risks due to heightened myocardial demand during labor. Most cases occur in the third trimester or postpartum , with a majority presenting as ST-segment elevation MI ( STEMI ). Common mechanisms include spontaneous coronary dissection and atherosclerotic disease. Maternal and fetal mortality rates are reported as 7% and 5%, respectively. Management: Similar to nonpregnant patients, successful cases of PCI and stent placement are reported during pregnancy. Severe cases may require cardiopulmonary resuscitation.
