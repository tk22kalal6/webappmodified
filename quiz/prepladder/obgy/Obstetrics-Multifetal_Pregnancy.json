      "explanation": "accommodate the increased metabolic demands of both fetuses. One of the major adaptations is an increase in cardiac output , which can lead to symptoms such as fatigue and shortness of breath. Physiological Changes in Twin Pregnancy: Increased Blood Volume: Twin pregnancies are associated with greater blood volume (50 - 60%) than singleton pregnancies (40 - 50%). Decreased Peripheral Vascular Resistance: There is a decrease in PVR compared to singleton pregnancies. Cardiac Output: The cardiac output in twin pregnancies is significantly higher than in singleton pregnancies. Blood Pressure: Despite the increased blood volume and cardiac output, the overall blood pressure in twin pregnancies may not rise proportionally due to the decreased PVR. Pre-eclampsia: Twin pregnancies have a higher incidence of pre-eclampsia. The decreased PVR and increased blood volume can exacerbate the endothelial dysfunction characteristic of pre-eclampsia. Uterine growth in multifetal pregnancies is significantly greater than in singleton pregnancies. Particularly in monozygotic twins, excessive amniotic fluid can accumulate quickly. The expanding uterus can significantly compress and displace the maternal abdominal organs and lungs. In rare cases, maternal renal function may become seriously impaired, likely due to obstructive uropathy. Peripheral vascular resistance decreases in twin pregnancies. ( Option B ruled out) The blood volume also expands more than in singleton pregnancies, contributing to peripheral edema. This physiological adaptation ensures adequate blood flow and nutrient delivery to both fetuses. ( Option C ruled out) There is increased GFR.

The acardiac twin receives blood from the normal twin via A-V anastomosis , which can lead to high-output cardiac failure in the normal twin. This deoxygenated blood, which keeps the recipient twin alive, however, goes only to the baby's lower limb, resulting in a mass of flesh with a very small head and properly formed lower limbs . There’s also an impending risk of cardiac failure in the donor baby as it is pumping blood to itself as well as into the recipient baby. Diagnosis is mainly done by USG Doppler or MRI . The main modality of treatment is by ligation of the umbilical cord (laser or RFA) of the acardiac twin under fetoscopic guidance.

TAPS occurs due to unbalanced feto-fetal transfusion through minuscule placental anastomoses in monochorionic twin pregnancies, leading to Hb difference of ≥ 5gm % between the two twins. Twin-to-Twin Transfusion Syndrome (TTTS)(Option A) is incorrect because it typically involves significant differences in amniotic fluid volumes between the twins, with one twin having polyhydramnios and the other having oligohydramnios. Twin Reversed Arterial Perfusion (TRAP)Sequence(Option B) is incorrect because it involves an acardiac twin that is perfused by the pump twin, leading to reversed blood flow and a different clinical presentation. Intrauterine Growth Restriction (IUGR)(Option D) is incorrect because Intrauterine Growth Restriction (IUGR) involves significant growth restriction without the specific Doppler findings of differing MCA PSV seen in TAPS.

Discordance may be due to twin-twin transfusion syndrome, placental insufficiency, IUGR, or structural anomalies occurring in one fetus.

      "explanation": "Monochorionic-monoamniotic pregnancy as MCMA twins share both the placenta and the amniotic sac. Chorionicity of the placenta is best diagnosed by ultrasound (TVS) at 11–14 weeks of gestation. In dichorionic twins there is a thick septum (>2 mm) between the two gestational sacs. It is best identified at the base of the membrane, where a triangular projection is seen. This is due to extension of chorionic villi into the potential inter chorionic space. This is known as lambda or twin peak sign. Presence of lambda or twin peak sign indicates dichorionic placenta. Presence of one gestational sac with a thin (<2 mm) dividing membrane, and two fetuses, (‘T’ sign) suggests monochorionic diamniotic pregnancy. A. ‘Twin peak’ sign: In dichorionic diamniotic twin gestations , the chorion and amnion for each twin reflect away from the fused placenta to form the intertwin membrane. A potential space exists in the intertwin membrane, filled by proliferating placental villi giving rise to the twin peak sign. The twin peak sign appears as a triangle with the base at the chorionic surface and the apex in the intertwin membrane. B. In monochorionic, diamniotic twins , the intertwin membrane only comprises two amnions. C. Color Doppler scan (TVS) showing twin pregnancy. A thick intertwin membrane (twin peak sign) of the dichorionic, diamniotic placenta is seen. This finding indicates a Dichorionic-Diamniotic (DCDA) twin pregnancy, where each twin has its own placenta and amniotic sac. (Option A ruled out) This describes a Monochorionic-Diamniotic (MCDA) twin pregnancy, where twins share a placenta but have separate amniotic sacs. (Option B ruled out) This scenario is not physiologically possible in twin pregnancies; twins cannot share a single amniotic sac if they have separate placentas. (Option D ruled out)",

Zygosity Chorionicity Zygosity refers to the genetic makeup of twin pregnancies. Monozygotic twins originate from a single fertilized egg that splits into two, leading to genetically identical individuals. Chorionicity refers to the placenta’s membrane status.
