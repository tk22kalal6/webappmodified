      "explanation": "Correct answer: A) Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS) Explanation: Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS), also known as Stein-Leventhal syndrome, is a heterogeneous, multisystem endocrinopathy in women of reproductive age with ovarian expression of various metabolic disturbances. Components of PCOS : Increased androgens Ovulatory dysfunction Polycystic ovaries Clinical features : Usually present in young women Central obesity (BMI > 30kg/cm 2 ), waistline> 88cm. Oligomenorrhea, amenorrhoea Infertility Hirsutism Acanthosis nigricans due to insulin resistance Endometriosis (Option B) involves the growth of endometrial tissue outside the uterus and presents with pelvic pain, dysmenorrhea and infertility. While it can cause irregular menstrual cycles, it does not typically cause acne, hirsutism, or multiple ovarian cysts. Hypothyroidism (Option C) can cause menstrual irregularities, weight gain, and fatigue. However, it does not commonly present with acne, hirsutism, or multiple ovarian cysts. Hyperprolactinemia (Option D) is characterised by elevated levels of prolactin in the blood and can cause galactorrhea, menstrual disturbances, and infertility. It is not typically associated with acne, hirsutism, or the presence of multiple ovarian cysts. Reference: 1. William's Gynecology Edition 4th Page 389 - 392",

        "C": "Elevated estrogen levels",

      },
      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Correct answer: C) Elevated estrogen levels Explanation: Elevated estrogen levels can occur in some cases of PCOS due to disturbances in hormone regulation, it is not a primary diagnostic criterion for PCOS. Rotterdam Criteria: Any 2 of the following 3 should be present to make a provisional diagnosis for PCOS (Option A) Increased androgen levels: Hyperandrogenism/Hirsutism: PCOS is associated with elevated androgen levels, which can manifest as clinical signs (like hirsutism and acne) or biochemical findings (elevated testosterone). (Option B) Ovulatory dysfunction: Oligomenorrhea/Amenorrhea- Irregular menstrual cycles (oligomenorrhea) or absence of menstrual periods (amenorrhea) are common features of PCOS due to ovulatory dysfunction. (Option D) On USG: 1 or both ovaries >12 follicles with 2-9mm in size (<1cm)- One of the diagnostic criteria for PCOS is the presence of polycystic ovarian morphology, which is confirmed by ultrasound showing multiple cysts on the ovaries. USG : Necklace pattern arranged towards the periphery.",

      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: A) Fasting glucose : Fasting i nsulin ratio >4.5 Explanation: A fasting glucose-to-insulin ratio of less than 4.5 is characteristic of polycystic ovary syndrome. Hormonal profiles of PCOS: Increased LH/FSH ratio: Dysregulation of gonadotropin secretion. Decreased progesterone levels: Due to irregular menstrual cycles and ovulatory dysfunction. Abnormal insulin sensitivity: Insulin resistance is commonly associated with PCOS, leading to compensatory hyperinsulinemia. Increased Estradiol (E2) levels Increased LH levels Increased Androgens Increased dehydroepiandrosterone 17 alpha hydroxyprogesterone > 300ng/dL Testosterone > 2ng/mL Increased Prolactin Decreased Sex Hormone Binding Globulin(SHBG) Decreased E2/E1 ratio Fasting glucose/ Fastinginsulin ratio < 4.5 Reference: 1.

      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "Correct answer: A) OCPs Explanation : Management of PCOS OCPs OCPs containing cyproterone acetate or drospirenone (if acne and hirsutism present) OCPs and spironolactone Oestrogen suppresses androgens and adrenal hormones. It raises the secretion of SHBG in the liver thereby reducing the free testosterone. It also suppresses LH. It is given as low-dose combined pills having progestogen with lesser androgenic effect. Fourth-generation combined pills are preferred. It also prevents further acne and hirsutism development. Reference: 1. William's Gynecology Edition 4th Page 400-402",

      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Correct answer: B) Clomiphene Citrate Explanation : Drugs used to treat Infertility in PCOS Letrozole (preferred over clomiphene citrate) aromatase inhibitors No antiestrogenic action on the endometrium and cervix thus yielding better pregnancy rate. Induces Mono Follicular stimulation, thus avoiding multiple pregnancy No hyperstimulation syndrome Side effect - drowsiness Clomiphene citrate (Option B) Unlike letrozole, it has anti-estrogenic action on the endometrium and cervix, thereby decreasing the fertility rate. It can cause hyperstimulation Syndrome in <1% of patients. It induces ovulation in 80% of the cases and 40-45% conceive. Co-administration of dexamethasone leads to better outcomes. In resistant cases, Tamoxifen 80-160 mg daily for 5 days tried. Metformin It is used as an insulin sensitiser. Reduces the insulin level, delays glucose absorption and production of glucose in the liver It also improves the peripheral utilisation of the glucose. Reduces the free and total testosterone increases SHBG. Contraindicated in hepatic and renal disease Nowadays, instead of Metformin, some gynaecologists prefer using N-acetyl cysteine with micronutrients. This reduces the homocysteine level. Ketoconazole 800mg daily reduces testosterone secretion. If medical management fails, then surgical management can be undertaken. Reference: 1. William's Gynecology Edition 4th Page 400 - 402",
