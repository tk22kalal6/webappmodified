      "question": "During the removal of a submucosal fibroid by hysteroscopy, a deficit of 2000 mL is estimated in a patient. What is the immediate complication of this?",
      "options": {
        "A": "Acute tubular necrosis",
        "B": "DIC",
        "C": "Pulmonary edema",
        "D": "Thromboembolism"
      },
      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: C) Pulmonary edema The immediate complication of a fluid deficit (the amount of fluid absorbed by the body) of 2000mL during hysteroscopy is pulmonary oedema. Hysteroscopy and distension fluid: Hysteroscopy is both a diagnostic and therapeutic procedure Fluid distension is done to improve visualization of the uterine cavity For monopolar surgical instruments: Electrolyte-free, hypotonic solutions are used For bipolar surgical instruments: Isotonic distension fluids can be used A fluid deficit is a difference in the amount of distension fluid inserted and removed, which makes up the amount absorbed by the body. A complication associated with hysteroscopic procedures is excessive absorption of media. Distension media Feature Complications Carbon dioxide Highly soluble in blood so poses less risk The flow rate must be below 100ml/min Insufflation pressure must be < 100mmHg CO 2 emboli (rare) Intraoperative morbidity Death Dextran 70 Hyperosmolar medium Volume used should be < 300ml Allergic reaction (rare) Coagulopathy (rare) Vascular overload Heart failure Low viscosity fluids 1.5% glycine 3% sorbitol 5% mannitol Hypotonic Electrolyte free Absorption leads to major volume and electrolyte disturbances Pulmonary oedema Hyponatremia Heart failure Cerebral edema Death Cardiac and renal toxicity (from glycine) Other complications of hysteroscopy: Uterine perforation Hemorrhage Gas embolism Acute tubular necrosis (ATN) (Option A) is a kidney disorder involving damage to the renal tubules, usually due to ischemia (lack of blood supply) or nephrotoxic agents. While severe dehydration can lead to kidney injury, ATN is not the immediate complication resulting from a fluid deficit during a hysteroscopic procedure. DIC (Option B) is a serious condition characterized by widespread activation of the clotting cascade, leading to the formation of microclots throughout the bloodstream. This excessive clotting consumes clotting factors and platelets, leading to bleeding tendencies elsewhere in the body. It occurs with significant fluid loss. Thromboembolism (Option D) refers to the formation of a blood clot that dislodges and travels through the bloodstream, potentially causing blockages in vital organs. While clotting issues can arise from factors related to dehydration and surgery, immediate thromboembolism is not a direct complication of a fluid deficit during a hysteroscopic procedure.

      "question": "For which of the following diagnoses in the given OT list would hysteroscopy be the preferred procedure?",
      "options": {
        "A": "Tubal ligation",
        "B": "Asherman syndrome",
        "C": "Cervical polyp",
        "D": "Subserosal fibroid"
      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: B) Asherman syndrome Asherman syndrome is the spectrum of scarring due to firm adhesions, dense bands or complete obliteration of the uterine cavity, which must be evaluated by hysteroscopy. Hysteroscopy Indications Diagnostic: AUB Infertility (Asherman syndrome) Recurrent miscarriage (Asherman syndrome) Congenital Uterine Anomalies Therapeutic: Lost or displaced IUD Uterine septum Polyps Leiomyomas: It is preferred for fibroids below 5cm Endometrial ablation Hysteroscopic sterilization Intrauterine adhesions Proximal tubal obstruction Procedure Position: Modified dorsal lithotomy Cervical exposure Anesthesia: Based on the patient’s requirement Cervical dilation Uterine distention Visualization and imaging Intrauterine cutting and hemostasis Other instrumentation: Based on the patient's condition. Contraindications Active uterine or cervical infections Large uterine cavity ( > 10 cm in length) Confirmed cervical or endometrial cancer Pregnancy. Tubal ligation (Option A) , also known as female sterilization, is a procedure performed to block or seal the fallopian tubes, thereby preventing the fertilization of eggs by sperm. This procedure does not involve the uterine cavity, so hysteroscopy would not be necessary for tubal ligation. A cervical polyp (Option C) is a benign growth that arises from the inner lining of the cervix. It does not involve the uterine cavity but rather protrudes into the cervical canal. Therefore, hysteroscopy is not typically required for the diagnosis or removal of a cervical polyp. A subserosal fibroid (Option D) is a type of uterine fibroid that grows on the outer surface of the uterus. It does not protrude into the uterine cavity, so hysteroscopy is not necessary for its diagnosis or treatment. Reference: Berek & Novak's Gynecology, 16th edition, Page: 1537 to 1575.

      "question": "What is the cause of lactational amenorrhea?",
      "options": {
        "A": "Increased progesterone",
        "B": "Increased GnRH secretion",
        "C": "Decreased prolactin secretion",
        "D": "Increased prolactin secretion"
      },
      "correct_answer": "D",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: D) Increased prolactin secretion Explanation: Elevated prolactin levels during lactation lead to suppression of normal menstrual cycling through interference with hypothalamic-pituitary-ovarian function . Lactation is a physiological state of hyperprolactinemia with associated amenorrhea . Lactational Amenorrhea: During breastfeeding, prolactin levels are elevated. High prolactin levels cause: Suppression of GnRH (Gonadotropin-Releasing Hormone) release from the hypothalamus Disruption of the pulsatile release pattern of GnRH Reduction in LH (Luteinizing Hormone) pulses from the pituitary Without proper LH pulses: Ovulation doesn't occur Regular menstrual cycles don't resume (amenorrhea) Hormones that favor milk production Hormones that inhibit milk production Prolactin Insulin Glucocorticoids Growth hormone Thyroxine Estrogen Progesterone Increased progesterone (Option A): Progesterone levels are low during lactation because ovulation does not occur, and no corpus luteum forms to produce progesterone. Increased GnRH secretion (Option B): Prolactin inhibits GnRH secretion; thus, GnRH levels are decreased, not increased. Decreased prolactin secretion (Option C): Decreased prolactin would lead to the resumption of GnRH pulsatility, ovulation, and menstrual cycles, which contradicts the physiology of lactational amenorrhea.

      "question": "A 26-year-old woman who has had 2 children through normal delivery presents with a dull aching pain over the abdomen, with irregular menses. Per vaginal examination revealed a mass felt through the posterior fornix. A USG showed a clear ovarian cyst of size 5 x 5 cm. What is the next best step?",
      "options": {
        "A": "Measure CA 125 levels",
        "B": "Follow up after 6 weeks",
        "C": "Laparoscopy",
        "D": "CT pelvis"
      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Correct answer: B) Follow up after 6 weeks Explanation: A clear ovarian cyst measuring 5 x 5 cm in a reproductive-age woman is likely a functional ovarian cyst. The recommended management is observation with a follow-up ultrasound after 6 weeks to monitor for resolution. Functional Ovarian Cysts: Arise from ovarian follicles during follicle maturation and ovulation. Types: Single Cysts: Most common, often a single follicular or corpus luteum cyst. Multiple Cysts: Can occur in conditions like: Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS) Ovarian Hyperstimulation Syndrome (OHSS) FSH-secreting pituitary adenomas Features: Functional cysts are typically 3–7 cm, and those larger than 10 cm or persistent for more than 3 months may require further investigation for malignancy. Related to hormonal variations. Filled with clear fluid (unless hemorrhage occurs). Benign, often asymptomatic Typically resolve on their own Management: Observation: Most cysts resolve spontaneously within 4-6 months. Follow-up: Regular ultrasound after 6-12 weeks to monitor persistent or enlarging cysts. Symptomatic Treatment: Combined oral contraceptives (COCs) may be prescribed for pain or irregular menses. Surgery: Indicated for cysts larger than 10 cm, persistent, or symptomatic (e.g., pain, torsion). Measure CA 125 levels (Option A): Elevated CA 125 can indicate ovarian cancer but is often raised in benign conditions like menstruation, endometriosis, or pelvic inflammatory disease. It is primarily useful in postmenopausal women with suspected malignancy. Laparoscopy (Option B): Immediate surgery is unnecessary for a likely functional cyst. Laparoscopy is considered if the cyst persists, grows, or causes acute symptoms like torsion or rupture. CT pelvis (Option C): A transvaginal ultrasound is the preferred imaging for ovarian cysts. CT is reserved for detecting and staging suspected ovarian neoplasms, which is not indicated here.
