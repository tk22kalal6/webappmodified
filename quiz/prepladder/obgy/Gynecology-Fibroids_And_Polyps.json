      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: B) Hysteroscopic polypectomy for both patients. Explanation: Hysteroscopic polypectomy is recommended for postmenopausal women due to the higher malignancy risk. In premenopausal women, it is indicated for polyps causing abnormal bleeding, >1.5 cm, or associated with infertility. It is the preferred method for removing endometrial polyps. Postmenopausal Women: Should undergo hysteroscopic polypectomy regardless of symptoms due to a higher risk of malignancy. Premenopausal Women: Hysteroscopic polypectomy is indicated if the polyp Causes abnormal uterine bleeding Causes infertility Is multiple Is larger than 1.5 cm Is a prolapsed polyp Is a recurrent polyp Diagnostic Hysteroscopy In Premenopausal Women, if hysteroscopic polypectomy is not performed, diagnostic hysteroscopy should be done. Post-Polypectomy Treatment Hormone Therapy: Premenopausal women may receive progesterone or continuous GnRH therapy to manage endometrial overgrowth. However, bleeding may recur after stopping treatment.

The menopausal transition of fibroid: Estrogen and progesterone play an important role In the development of uterine fibroid. Fibroid is an estrogen-sensitive tumor, which grows in the presence of estrogen. After menopause, since estrogen and progesterone level decreases, the fibroid regresses in size. In perimenopausal women with symptomatic uterine fibroid, the patients should be treated conservatively as the tumour regresses after attaining menopause. For symptomatic relief, treatment with NSAIDs, OCPs or GnRH agonists should be bridged between the perimenopausal and menopausal phases (Option B) . Myomectomy (Option A) is generally reserved for patients who prefer to remain fertile and is not suggested for perimenopausal women. Uterine artery embolization (Option C) , is an angiographic procedure that obscures uterine blood flow and causes ischemia of the uterus. It is not the first line of treatment in perimenopausal women. Hysterectomy (Option D) is a major surgical procedure that is usually performed as a last resort if the patient's symptoms do not improve. Reference: 1.

Clinical features: Asymptomatic (75%) - mostly an incidental finding Abnormal uterine bleeding(AUB)(30%): Menorrhagia,metrorrhagia Dysmenorrhea, dyspareunia Subfertility Pressure symptoms Bladder symptoms: increased frequency or retention of urine Rectal symptoms: constipation Lower abdominal or pelvic pain or heaviness Irregularly enlarged lower abdomen. Endometriosis (Option A) also presents with pelvic pain and abnormal menstrual bleeding but an irregularly enlarged uterus is not seen. An ovarian cyst (Option B) most commonly, is asymptomatic but increases the risk of ovarian torsion and presents with an adnexal mass but not an enlarged uterus. Polycystic ovarian syndrome (Option D) is usually seen in obese women and presents with irregular menstrual bleeding along with hormonal symptoms such as hirsutism and acne.

      "explanation": "Correct Answer: C) Conservative care with pain relief and support Explanation: Red Degeneration: Red degeneration, also known as carneous degeneration, is a complication of uterine fibroids that can occur during pregnancy. This condition is most likely to arise during the second half of pregnancy and the puerperium, impacting an estimated 5-10% of women with uterine fibroids. Pathophysiology: Blood supply is redirected to the developing fetus, resulting in decreased blood supply to the fibroid and subsequent degeneration. Conservative management with pain relief and supportive care is the best course of management (option C). It involves pain relief with NSAIDs or acetaminophen, hydration, and bed rest. Immediate myomectomy (Option A) to remove the fibroid is not recommended as it poses a risk of fetal injury and uterine rupture. Uterine artery embolization (Option B) is not recommended in pregnant women as it leads to fetal loss. It can be done in patients who are not pregnant and who do not desire future fertility. Administration of high-dose corticosteroids (Option D) has no proven effect for treating degenerating fibroid. Reference: 1. Berek & Novak's Gynecology, 16th edition, page 570 (PDF) 2.

Degeneration of Fibroid: Degeneration is a secondary change seen in fibroids. The most common symptom of degeneration is pelvic pain . Type of degeneration Pathophysiology Hyaline degeneration Accumulation of proteinous tissue Cystic degeneration Extreme fluid collection Calcareous degeneration (womb stone) Deposition of phosphates and carbonates in the periphery Red degeneration (hemorrhagic) Decrease in blood supply to the fibroid Sarcomatous transformation (Option A) is a rare secondary change in leiomyoma, which may present with acute pelvic pain or a sudden increase in the size of the fibroid. Ovarian torsion (Option C) presents with severe pelvic pain, fever and adnexal mass. Atrophy of fibroids (Option D) usually occurs due to ageing and ischemia after menopause. Reference: 1.

Histopathology reveals interlacing bundles of smooth muscle cells with a characteristic whorled appearance. Fibroids have an Eosinophilic cytoplasm and oval nuclei (cigar-shaped) with blunt ends. Adenomyosis (Option A) is the presence of endometrial glands and stroma within the myometrium, usually causing a uniformly enlarged and tender uterus. Histopathologically, adenomyosis shows endometrial glands and stroma interspersed within the myometrium. Endometrial Polyps (Option B) present with intermenstrual spotting rather than heavy bleeding. Histopathologically, endometrial polyps show irregularly shaped glands and a fibrous stroma, sometimes with blood vessels. Endometriosis (Option D) is endometrial-like tissue outside the uterus, causing chronic pain and infertility, with histopathology showing ectopic endometrial glands and stroma.",
