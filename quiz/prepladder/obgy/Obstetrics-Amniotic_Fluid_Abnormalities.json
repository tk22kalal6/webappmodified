        "D": "Only 4"
      },
      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: C) 2 and 3 Explanation: Early in pregnancy, amniotic fluid is similar in composition to extracellular fluid. Amniotic fluid arises as a transudate of plasma either from the fetus through its non-keratinized skin or from the mother across the the uterine decidua & placental surface. Fetal urine production does not become a major component of amniotic fluid until the second trimester. During early gestation, amniotic fluid is derived from maternal plasma, which passes through the fetal membranes into the amniotic cavity (Filtration of maternal plasma). Water transport across the fetal skin continues until keratinization occurs at 22 - 25 weeks. (Transudation through the fetal skin) . From about 12 weeks onwards, the fetal kidneys start producing urine, which becomes the primary source of amniotic fluid in the second half of pregnancy. In late gestation, fetal respiratory tract secretions also contribute to the amniotic fluid. Main Source of amniotic fluid (Based on gestational age): Gestational age Source of Amniotic Fluid First Trimester (Early Gestation) Ultrafiltration of maternal plasma through the placenta. Up to 20 Weeks (Early to Mid-Gestation) Transudation across fetal skin due to pressure gradients. After 20 Weeks (Late Gestation) Fetal urine from mature fetal kidneys. Reference: 1.

      "question": "A 28-year-old pregnant woman at 38 weeks gestation presents to the labour ward in active labour. During amniotomy, the amniotic fluid is noted to be golden in colour. Which condition is most likely responsible for this finding?",
      "options": {
        "A": "Postmaturity",
        "B": "Rh incompatibility",
        "C": "Meconium staining",
        "D": "Chronic fetal distress"
      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: B) Rh incompatibility Explanation: The golden colour of amniotic fluid is characteristic of excessive hemolysis of fetal red blood cells due to Rh incompatibility. In this condition, the Rh-negative mother's antibodies attack the Rh-positive fetus's red blood cells, causing hemolysis and increased bilirubin production, which gives the amniotic fluid a golden hue. Amniotic fluid Color Clinical Condition Clear or Straw-colored Normal. Green Meconium staining, Fetal distress (Option C) Golden Rh incompatibility, excessive hemolysis of fetal RBCs (Option B) Greenish yellow (saffron) Postmaturity (Option A) Dark colored Concealed accidental hemorrhage. Dark brown (tobacco juice) Intrauterine death (IUD). Reference: William's Obstetrics, 26th Edition page 254, 255, 256",

      "question": "How is the Amniotic Fluid Index (AFI) calculated during a prenatal ultrasound examination?",
      "options": {
        "A": "The total volume of amniotic fluid in millilitres",
        "B": "The sum of the four deepest vertical pockets of amniotic fluid",
        "C": "The single largest vertical pocket of amniotic fluid",
        "D": "The average depth of amniotic fluid in all four quadrants"
      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: B) The sum of the four deepest vertical pockets of amniotic fluid Explanation: During a prenatal ultrasound, the Amniotic Fluid Index (AFI) is determined by measuring the deepest vertical pocket of amniotic fluid in each of the four uterine quadrants and summing the depths. The normal range of the Amniotic Fluid Index (AFI) in a term pregnancy is generally considered to be between 5-24 cm. Gestational age and Amniotic fluid volume: 32-34 weeks : Maximum amniotic fluid volume is typically around 1000 ml, providing ample fluid for fetal development and movement. 36 weeks : Amniotic fluid volume naturally decreases to around 800 ml. 40 weeks: Amniotic fluid volume continues to decrease to approximately 600 ml. Clinical significance of AFI: Condition AFI Range Description Normal 5-24 cm Associated with normal fetal well-being. Oligohydramnios < 5 cm Indicates lower-than-normal amniotic fluid volume and may lead to fetal growth restriction. Polyhydramnios > 24 cm Indicates excessive amniotic fluid accumulation, increasing the risk of preterm labour, placental abruption, and umbilical cord complications. The total volume of amniotic fluid in milliliters (Option A) Estimating the total volume of amniotic fluid in milliliters would require more complex techniques like 3D ultrasound or MRI, which are not used in routine AFI calculation. The single largest vertical pocket of amniotic fluid (Option C) This measures only the largest vertical pocket of amniotic fluid. This method is an alternative to AFI but is not the same as calculating AFI, which requires summing the four deepest pockets. The average depth of amniotic fluid in all four quadrants (Option D) AFI is not based on the average depth of fluid in the four quadrants. Instead, it is the sum of the deepest vertical pockets in each of the four quadrants. Reference: Williams Obstetrics, 26th Edition, page 257.",

      },
      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: A) Fetal anencephaly Explanation: The given clinical scenario points to the diagnosis of Polyhydramnios, characterised by excessive amniotic fluid accumulation. In pregnancies without diabetes or hypertension, fetal anomalies such as anencephaly are commonly associated with polyhydramnios, occurring in about 50% of cases. The excessive production of amniotic fluid can be attributed to: Leakage from the exposed meninges Lack of fetal swallowing reflex Inhibition of fetal antidiuretic hormone, resulting in increased fetal urine output. Causes of Oligohydramnios and Polyhydramnios: Causes Polyhydramnios Oligohydramnios Fetal Factors Fetal anomalies (e.g., anencephaly, esophageal atresia) (Option A) Twin-to-twin transfusion syndrome (TTTS) Hydrops fetalis Renal agenesis (Option B) Post-term pregnancy Fetal growth restriction (IUGR) Amnion nodosum (Option D) Maternal Factors Diabetes mellitus Cardiac disease Renal disease Maternal hypertension Preeclampsia Placental insufficiency (Option C) Placental Factors Chorioangioma Placental abruption Also Note - AMNION NODOSUM is a condition characterized by numerous small, light-tan nodules affixed to the amnion that overlies the chorionic plate. These contain deposits of fetal squames and fibrin that reflect prolonged and severe oligohydramnios. Reference: William's Obstetrics, 26th Edition, page 257, 258, 259, 260, 261",

      "question": "A 28-year-old woman presents for a routine prenatal ultrasound at 20 weeks gestation. Severe oligohydramnios and bilateral renal agenesis are noted in the fetus, strongly suggesting Potter syndrome. Which of the following is NOT typically a component of this syndrome?",
      "options": {

        "C": "Limb deformities",
        "D": "Cardiac anomalies"
      },
      "correct_answer": "D",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: D) Cardiac anomalies Explanation: Cardiac anomalies are not associated with Potters syndrome. Potter syndrome is a rare condition caused by bilateral renal agenesis, which results in oligohydramnios during fetal development. The classic features of Potter syndrome, also known as Potter's triad, resulting from reduced amniotic fluid, include: Pulmonary Hypoplasia (Option A): Underdevelopment of the lungs due to the lack of amniotic fluid. Distinctive Facial Features (Option B): Often referred to as \"Potter facies,\" characterised by a flattened nose, recessed chin, prominent epicanthal folds, and low-set ears. Limb deformities (Option C) can occur due to restricted fetal movements in the reduced amniotic fluid environment. Differentiating Potter Syndrome and Potter Sequence: Potter Syndrome specifically refers to the condition caused by bilateral renal agenesis leading to oligohydramnios and its associated features. Potter Sequence refers to similar abnormalities resulting from severely decreased amniotic fluid due to other causes, such as bilateral multicystic dysplastic kidneys or autosomal recessive polycystic kidney disease.",

        "A": "Fetal akinesia deformation sequence",
        "B": "Amniotic band syndrome",
        "C": "Congenital lymphedema",
        "D": "Fetal alcohol syndrome"
      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: B) Amniotic band syndrome Explanation: Amniotic band syndrome (ABS) , also known as amniotic band sequence or constriction band syndrome, in which fibrous bands of the amniotic membrane that entangle fetal body parts, leading to various malformations. It is an anatomical disruption sequence in which amnion bands tether, constrict or amputate fetal parts for eg. limb-reduction defects and facial clefts. Umbilical cord compromise is another sequelae. These bands may form spontaneously or follow fetal surgical procedures. The key features of ABS include: Floating Structures: Thin, sheet-like structures in the amniotic fluid represent ruptured amniotic membrane, forming the characteristic bands. Constriction Rings: These bands can wrap around fetal body parts, particularly limbs, causing constriction rings. Severe cases may lead to lymphatic obstruction, vascular compromise, and even amputation. Limb Deformities: ABS can cause various limb deformities, such as syndactyly, acrosyndactyly, or complete amputation of digits or limbs. The severity of ABS varies, ranging from minor constriction rings to major malformations or fetal death. Management depends on the severity and may include close monitoring, fetal surgery in some cases, or postnatal corrective surgeries. Fetal akinesia deformation sequence (Option A) is characterized by decreased or absent fetal movement, leading to joint contractures and pulmonary hypoplasia. It doesn't involve amniotic bands or floating membrane fragments. Congenital lymphedema (Option C): While this can cause swelling of limbs, it doesn't explain the presence of amniotic bands or the specific constriction rings noted in the scenario. Fetal alcohol syndrome (Option D) is caused by maternal alcohol consumption during pregnancy and typically presents with facial abnormalities, growth deficiencies, and central nervous system problems. It does not involve amniotic bands or limb constrictions.",

      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: B) Fetal macrosomia Explanation: An AFI of 4 cm suggests oligohydramnios and fetal macrosomia is not a potential complication. Oligohydramnios is frequently associated with fetal growth restriction, where the fetus presents small for gestational age. Complications of Oligohydramnios include : Phase Complications During Pregnancy Pulmonary hypoplasia (Option A) Musculoskeletal deformities (Option D) Fetal growth restriction During Labor and Delivery Umbilical cord compression (Option C) Increased risk of cesarean delivery Meconium staining of amniotic fluid Low Apgar scores Fetal distress Management of Oligohydramnios can prevent these complications, which include: Close fetal monitoring with non-stress tests and biophysical profiles. Serial ultrasounds to assess fetal growth and amniotic fluid levels. Maternal hydration (oral or IV fluids) to increase amniotic fluid. Amnioinfusion in selected cases. Early delivery if fetal distress or severe oligohydramnios persists, especially in the near term. Reference: Williams Obstetrics, 26th Edition, Page 260",

      "explanation": "Correct Answer: C) Expectant management with close monitoring Explanation: An AFI of 26 cm suggests Polyhydramnios. Expectant management with close monitoring is the most appropriate initial management for mild to moderate polyhydramnios without complications It involves: Regular ultrasounds to assess amniotic fluid volume and fetal growth. Non-stress tests to monitor fetal well-being. Maternal education about signs of preterm labour or membrane rupture. Management principles include Relieve symptoms Identify cause Prevent and manage complications Amnioreduction (Option A) While this can provide symptomatic relief, it's usually reserved for: Severe polyhydramnios (typically AFI > 35-40 cm). Significant maternal discomfort or respiratory compromise. Cases where preterm delivery is anticipated. Indomethacin therapy (Option B) : This can be considered for reducing amniotic fluid production, but: It's typically used for acute management in preterm pregnancies. It has potential fetal side effects, including premature closure of the ductus arteriosus. It's not the first-line treatment for this case at 30 weeks gestation. Early delivery via cesarean section (Option D): This is not appropriate as the initial management because: The patient is only at 30 weeks gestation There are no signs of fetal distress or other complications necessitating immediate delivery. The risks of prematurity outweigh the risks of continuing the pregnancy with monitoring.",
