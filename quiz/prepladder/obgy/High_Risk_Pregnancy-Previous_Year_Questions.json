      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: B) Growth of 10^5 coliform in voided urine sample Explanation: A urinary tract infection (UTI) in a pregnant woman, especially in the 2nd trimester, is defined by a positive urine culture showing a growth of >100,000 colony-forming units (CFUs) of bacteria, typically coliforms such as E. coli, in a voided urine sample. (Option A ruled out) Urine culture is considered the gold standard for diagnosing UTIs in pregnancy. UTIs can range from asymptomatic bacteriuria to symptomatic infections like cystitis or pyelonephritis. Frequency with dysuria with >3 WBC/HPF (Option C): While the presence of white blood cells (WBCs) in the urine indicates infection or inflammation (pyuria), this alone is not enough to define a UTI. The presence of symptoms like dysuria and WBCs along with a positive urine culture is necessary for diagnosis. Frequency with dysuria with positive nitrite and leucoesterase dipstick test (Option D): While a positive dipstick test for nitrites and leukocyte esterase can suggest a UTI, it is not definitive. A urine culture showing bacterial growth of 10^5 CFUs is the most reliable method for diagnosis.

      },
      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: A) Stop warfarin and start LMWH Explanation: Patients who have undergone heart valve replacement with a prosthetic mechanical valve require lasting anticoagulation. Warfarin is not recommended during pregnancy as it can cause birth defects (teratogenicity) during the first trimester and hemorrhagic complications during about 2 to 4 weeks before delivery. LMWHs don't pass the placenta and are safer for the developing fetus. Teratogenicity of Anticoagulants: Medicine FDA category Adverse effects Teratogenic Use during lactation Remark Vitamin K antagonists (warfarin) X Teratogenicity, fetal bleeding complications Yes Allowed: Small amounts of metabolites pass into breast milk - Heparin (UFH) C Bone demineralization, osteoporosis, fractures in mother, risk of HIT No Allowed - LMWH B Lower risk of HIT and osteoporosis than UFH No Allowed - Danaparoid B - No Allowed - Incorrect Options: Heparin anticoagulants (Option B) are less effective than VKAs for anticoagulation with mechanical heart valves, leaving the pregnant patient more vulnerable to a thrombotic event. Continuing warfarin use (Option C) in early pregnancy can increase the chance of miscarriage and bleeding in the baby's brain. Warfarin use in early pregnancy can affect the baby's bones and development of the face. Combining LMWH and aspirin (Option D) can increase the risk of bleeding complications in the patient; hence, it should be avoided.

      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: B) Overt diabetes Explanation: Overt diabetes in pregnancy is defined as hyperglycemia first recognized during pregnancy that meets the diagnostic threshold of diabetes in non-pregnant adults. Diagnostic Criteria for Overt Diabetes (ADA Guidelines): The diagnosis can be made in a woman with any of the following: A fasting plasma glucose value ≥ 126 mg/dl (7.0 mmol/L) 2-h plasma glucose ≥ 200 mg/dl (11.1 mmol/l) Random plasma glucose value ≥ 200 mg/dl (11.1 mmol/l) in the presence of symptoms HbA1c ≥ 6.5% (48 mmol/mol) Maturity onset diabetes of the young (Option A): While MODY can present during pregnancy, it typically has a strong family history and presents at a younger age. The absence of family history details and typical age of presentation make this diagnosis less likely. Gestational diabetes mellitus (Option C): GDM and overt diabetes differ in severity. GDM is a less severe form of hyperglycemia (Fasting Plasma <92mg/dl and HbA1c ≥ 5.7-6.4%). Latent autoimmune diabetes in adults (Option D): The case does not talk of pancreatic antibodies, and the significant hyperglycemia early in pregnancy is more consistent with overt type 2 diabetes.

      "explanation": "Correct Answer: A) HELLP syndrome Explanation: The syndrome of hemolysis with a microangiopathic blood smear, elevated liver enzymes, and low platelets, as seen in the given pregnant patient, is known as HELLP syndrome . HELLP syndrome is a severe variant of preeclampsia that can occur without significant hypertension. The clinical manifestations supporting the diagnosis are: Hemolysis evidenced by peripheral smear findings Elevated liver enzymes with AST of 90 IU/L Low platelets at 62,000/mm³ Right upper quadrant pain suggesting liver involvement Normal blood pressure does not exclude diagnosis Criteria for Diagnosis of HELLP Syndrome: Tenesse Classification: Haemolysis Abnormal peripheral blood smear (Hemolysis) Elevated lactate dehydrogenase (LDH > 600 IU/L) Elevated bilirubin ( ≥ 1.2 mg/dL) Decreased serum haptoglobin Elevated Liver Enzymes Elevated (AST & ALT > 70 IU/L) Low Platelet Count Platelets < 100,000/ µ L Another criterion, namely the Mississippi Triple Class System, further classifies HELLP Syndrome based on the platelet counts. Mississippi Triple Class System Class I (severe) AST & ALT > 70 IU/L LDH > 600 IU/L Platelets <50 x 10 9 /L Class II (moderate) AST & ALT > 70 IU/L LDH > 600 IU/L Platelets 50-100 x 10 9 /L Class III (mild) AST & ALT > 40 IU/L LDH > 600 IU/L Platelets 100-150 x 10 9 /L Hepatitis B (Option B): While hepatitis B can cause elevated liver enzymes during pregnancy, it does not explain the thrombocytopenia or hemolysis. Additionally, hepatitis typically presents with jaundice and would not cause such levels of platelet reduction. Acute fatty liver of pregnancy (Option C): AFL can be differentiated from HELLP syndrome by the presence of leucocytosis, hypoglycemia, more pronounced hyperbilirubinemia, an initial lack of hemolysis, and thrombocytopenia (100 G/l), lower antithrombin levels (65%) and prolonged prothrombin times. Since these features are not present, AFL can be ruled out. Obstetric cholestasis (Option D): The diagnosis of intrahepatic cholestasis of pregnancy (ICP) presents primarily with pruritus and elevated bile acids, without thrombocytopenia or hemolysis. Condition HELLP Syndrome Acute Fatty Liver of Pregnancy (AFLP) Intrahepatic Cholestasis of Pregnancy (ICP) Main Characteristics Hemolysis (breakdown of red blood cells), Elevated liver enzymes, Low Platelet count Buildup of fat in the liver, liver dysfunction Impaired bile flow, elevated bile acids, itching Occurrence Usually occurs in the third trimester, but can also occur postpartum Typically occurs in the third trimester Usually occurs in the third trimester, but can occur earlier Symptoms Abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, headache, edema Abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, jaundice, malaise Intense itching, especially on palms and",

      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: A) Renal agenesis Explanation: Renal agenesis occurs when one or both kidneys fail to develop during embryonic development. Around the 13th week of gestation, the kidneys begin producing urine, which contributes to amniotic fluid. Impaired kidney development leads to oligohydramnios, characterized by low amniotic fluid levels , which can be detected via ultrasound and serves as a strong indicator of renal agenesis. Clinical Manifestations: Potter facies: Low-set ears, beaked nose, prominent epicanthic folds, downward slant to eyes Pulmonary hypoplasia causing respiratory failure Limb deformities Reduced fetal urine excretion Oligohydramnios causing fetal compression Associated Complications: Growth restriction Limb contractures Mortality Delayed lung maturation Inability to endure childbirth Neural tube defect (Option B): Neural tube defects are associated with polyhydramnios. Esophageal atresia (Option C): Esophageal atresia occurs due to excess amniotic fluid (polyhydramnios). Premature birth (Option D): Premature birth is a complication of oligohydramnios, not a cause.

      "question": "A 32-year-old pregnant female is carrying monochorionic diamniotic twins. On ultrasound examination, there is evidence of polyhydramnios in one twin and oligohydramnios in the other. What is the most likely complication?",

      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Correct answer: C) Twin to twin transfusion syndrome Explanation: Pregnant female having monochorionic diamniotic twin pregnancy with ultrasound showing polyhydramnios in one twin and oligohydramnios in the other, the most likely diagnosis is Twin to Twin Transfusion Syndrome (TTTS). Twin-Twin Transfusion Syndrome (TTTS): TTTS in monochorionic-diamniotic twin pregnancies involves blood transfusion from a donor twin to the recipient, causing anemia and growth restriction in the donor, and polycythemia and heart failure in the recipient. Presentation: Donor twin: Smaller, pale, with oligohydramnios. Recipient twin: Larger, with polyhydramnios and hyperviscosity. Incidence: TTTS occurs in 10-15% of monochorionic twin pregnancies. Pathophysiology: Unidirectional blood flow via deep arteriovenous anastomoses leads to volume depletion in the donor and excess in the recipient, causing growth restriction and hydrops. Quintero Staging System: Stage Description Stage I Polyhydramnios in the recipient twin (deepest vertical pocket ≥ 8 cm) and oligohydramnios in the donor twin (deepest vertical pocket ≤ 2 cm), with a visible bladder in the donor twin. Stage II Severe oligohydramnios in the donor twin with no visible bladder. Stage III Critically abnormal Doppler findings, such as absent/reversed end-diastolic flow in the umbilical artery, reversed flow in the ductus venosus, or pulsatile flow in the umbilical vein in one or both twins. Stage IV Presence of hydrops fetalis in one or both twins, indicating severe fetal compromise. Stage V Demise of one or both twins. Management: Laser ablation: Targets placental anastomoses (16-26 weeks). Solomon Technique: Coagulates the entire vascular equator. Amnioreduction: Reduces amniotic fluid and prevents complications. Complications: Preterm birth (before 34 weeks), procedure-related issues (e.g., ruptured membranes, placental abruption), and Twin Anemia-Polycythemia Sequence (TAPS). Outcomes: Without treatment, perinatal mortality is 70-100%. After laser therapy, mortality is 30-50%, with 5-20% neurological impairment. Double-twin survival is ~70%. Selective Fetal Growth Restriction (sFGR) (Option A): While sFGR can occur in monochorionic twins, it doesn't typically cause the fluid imbalance (polyhydramnios in one twin and oligohydramnios in the other) seen in Twin-to-Twin Transfusion Syndrome (TTTS). sFGR is more related to growth differences between twins, not amniotic fluid abnormalities. Preterm Labor (Option B): Although monochorionic diamniotic pregnancies are at higher risk for preterm birth, preterm labor doesn't cause the specific fluid imbalance, characteristic of TTTS (polyhydramnios in one twin and oligohydramnios in the other). Neural Tube Defects (Option D) : Neural tube defects, such as spina bifida, are developmental anomalies that affect fetal development but do not cause the fluid imbalance observed in TTTS.

      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Correct answer: B) 1 and 2 only Explanation: Ultrasonography and MRI can be used to diagnose placenta accreta. Placenta Accreta Spectrum/Morbidly Adherent Placenta: Occurs when the placenta is abnormally adherent to the uterine wall after childbirth. It occurs due to insufficient formation of the decidua basalis and incomplete development of the fibrinoid or Nitabuch layer. It leads to abnormal invasion of trophoblasts, which hinders the placenta from separating naturally post-delivery. Diagnosis is made post-delivery when manual removal of the placenta is attempted, and the plane of cleavage between the placenta and the uterine wall cannot be made out. It can lead to Postpartum haemorrhage Infection Inversion of uterus Types: Placenta accreta spectrum Description Placenta accreta Villi is firmly adherent to the endometrium Placenta increta Villi invades the myometrium Placenta percreta Villi penetrate through the myometrium and to or through the serosa. Investigations: Ultrasonography: (1) Placental lacunae Thinning of the retroplacental myometrium Disruption of the bladder-uterine serosal interface Bridging vessels extending from the placenta to the bladder-serosal interface Placental bulge causing outward distortion of the uterine contour Colour Flow Doppler: Hypervascularity at the serosa-bladder interface MRI: (2) Uterine bulging Dark intraplacental bands on T2-weighted imaging Management of placenta accreta spectrum: Placenta Accreta Type Management Partial Placenta Accreta Remove as much placenta as possible. Use oxytocics to control bleeding. Total Placenta Accreta Complete family: Perform hysterectomy. Incomplete family: Leave the placenta for autolysis within the uterus and administer antibiotics. Consider uterine artery embolisation or Methotrexate therapy. Placenta Percreta with Bladder Invasion Perform hysterectomy with partial cystectomy. Angiography (Option A & C) is not traditionally used to diagnose placenta accreta. While it has therapeutic applications, such as embolization, its use involves radiation and contrast exposure, making it unsuitable for routine diagnosis during pregnancy due to potential risks to the mother and fetus. X-ray ( Option D) is not suitable for diagnosing placenta accreta due to the risk of exposing the fetus to ionizing radiation. Additionally, X-rays cannot provide detailed images of soft tissues like the uterus and placenta, making them ineffective in identifying the abnormalities associated with placenta accreta.",

      "explanation": "Prostaglandin: Thromboxane ratio increases in preeclampsia Correct Answer: A) Prostaglandins play an important role; Thromboxane A2 decreases; Prostaglandin: Thromboxane ratio increases in preeclampsia Explanation: In preeclampsia, there is a reduced or absent production of prostacyclin (PGI2) with increased production of thromboxane (TXA2), leading to a decreased prostacyclin-to-thromboxane ratio. This causes vasoconstriction and contributes to the pathophysiology of preeclampsia. Mechanisms of Preeclampsia Abnormal Trophoblastic Invasion Incomplete remodeling of spiral arteries → Narrow, high-resistance vessels → Reduced placental perfusion → Hypoxia. Endothelial Dysfunction sFlt-1 and endoglin release → Inhibition of VEGF and PIGF → Reduced NO production → Vasoconstriction, increased vascular permeability (proteinuria, edema).

Since she is in the third trimester with an INR of 3, the next step is to switch from warfarin to LMWH to reduce the risk of fetal teratogenicity. Recommendations for anticoagulants in pregnancy: Pregnancy significantly increases the risk of thromboembolism , but anticoagulation is vital for women with mechanical heart valves to prevent valve thrombosis. (if bioprosthetic valve replacement was done, anticoagulation therapy is not needed) Based on recent guidelines, the dose of warfarin is <5 mg. It may be given in the first trimester, but if the dose is ≥ 5 mg , it needs to be replaced with LMWH during the first trimester. Warfarin is teratogenic , potentially causing miscarriages, stillbirths, and a constellation of birth defects known as fetal warfarin syndrome. (Option C) Skeletal Abnormalities: Nasal hypoplasia Stippled epiphyses Shortened digits or limb abnormalities. Intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR). Craniofacial Abnormalities: Microcephaly (small head size), Midface hypoplasia, Cleft palate Neurological Abnormalities: Intellectual disability or developmental delays. Seizures Growth Abnormalities: Eye Abnormalities: Optic atrophy or blindness Strabismus. Heparin, in both unfractionated (UFH) and low-molecular-weight (LMWH) forms, is considered safer for the fetus during pregnancy as it does not cross the placenta. UFH , even at full anticoagulation doses, is considered inadequate for preventing valve thrombosis in pregnant women with mechanical heart valves. LMWH is associated with a lower risk of valve thrombosis compared to UFH, making it a preferred choice for many pregnant women requiring anticoagulation. A common approach is to start LMWH during the first trimester to minimize fetal risks, then switch to warfarin after the first trimester for better valve thrombosis protection. Near term, warfarin is discontinued to reduce bleeding risks during labor, then restarted shortly after delivery. Regular monitoring of anticoagulation levels PT-INR for warfarin, Anti-Xa levels for LMWH is not normally done, but it is essential during pregnancy. Stop warfarin and start heparin (Option B): LMWH is preferred over unfractionated heparin due to its longer half-life, once-daily dosing, and fewer side effects. If LMWH is unavailable, unfractionated heparin can be used as an alternative. Stop warfarin, start LMWH and aspirin (Option D): Aspirin 75-100 mg can be given daily in pregnancy. It can be continued in women with mechanical heart valves if needed for other indications.",

      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: A) Pre-gestational diabetes Explanation: The given image represents caudal regression syndrome or sacral agenesis which is caused by Pre-gestational diabetes (Option A) . Pre-gestational diabetes refers to diabetes that existed prior to pregnancy, whether it is Type 1 or Type 2 diabetes. Poorly controlled diabetes during early pregnancy has been associated with an increased risk of fetal malformations, including caudal regression syndrome and sacral agenesis. High blood sugar levels can disrupt normal fetal development, particularly affecting the development of the lower spine and spinal cord. Incorrect Options: Gestational diabetes mellitus (Option B) is a type of diabetes that develops during pregnancy. While poorly controlled GDM can have implications for fetal health, it is less commonly associated with the specific findings of caudal regression and sacral agenesis. The risk of these malformations is higher in pre-gestational diabetes. Effect of valproate (Option C) is an antiepileptic medication that has been associated with an increased risk of neural tube defects, including spina bifida. However, caudal regression and sacral agenesis are not directly linked to the use of valproate. While there may be an increased risk of certain malformations with valproate use, the specific findings in the question are more strongly associated with maternal diabetes. ACE inhibitors (Option D) are a class of blood pressure medications that are generally not recommended during pregnancy due to potential fetal complications. However, they are not directly linked to the specific findings of caudal regression and sacral agenesis. Maternal hypertension or the use of ACE inhibitors is not a common cause of these malformations. Reference: William's Gynaecology 4th Edition Page 280, 1071",

        "D": "Induce labour with PGE2 gel"
      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: B) Immediate caesarean section Explanation: The patient presents with two critical concerns: Preeclampsia: Persistently elevated blood pressure ( ≥ 140/90 mm Hg) with proteinuria (1+) is diagnostic of preeclampsia. This condition poses significant risks to both mother and fetus if the pregnancy is prolonged. Breech presentation of the first twin: A breech presentation, especially in twin pregnancies, increases the risk of complications during vaginal delivery. Given the gestational age of 38 weeks (full-term), immediate caesarean section is the safest approach to ensure the well-being of both the mother and the babies. Incorrect Options: Monitor BP and terminate pregnancy if BP rises (Option A) is not suitable because the patient already has elevated blood pressure on two occasions with proteinuria. These findings are suggestive of preeclampsia, a potentially serious condition that requires prompt management. Terminating pregnancy at 40 weeks of gestation (Option C) is not appropriate because waiting until 40 weeks of gestation may pose risks to both the mother and the babies, especially considering the presence of preeclampsia and the breech presentation of the first twin. Inducing labor with PGE2 gel (Option D) is not the recommended approach in this case due to the breech presentation of the first twin. Vaginal delivery in breech presentation can be associated with increased risks, especially in the presence of preeclampsia.

        "D": "MCA doppler peak systolic velocity"
      },
      "correct_answer": "D",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: D) MCA doppler peak systolic velocity Explanation: MCA doppler is a specialized ultrasound technique used to assess fetal anemia in Rh-negative sensitized mothers. When an Rh-negative mother is sensitized to Rh-positive fetal red blood cells, maternal antibodies can cross the placenta and cause the destruction of fetal red blood cells, leading to fetal anemia. MCA doppler measures the peak systolic velocity in the middle cerebral artery of the fetus, which correlates with fetal blood flow and oxygenation. A high MCA doppler peak systolic velocity indicates fetal anemia, prompting further evaluation and possible intervention, such as intrauterine transfusion. Incorrect Options: A biophysical profile (BPP) (Option A) is a prenatal ultrasound-based assessment that evaluates various parameters of fetal well-being, including fetal movement, fetal tone, fetal breathing, amniotic fluid volume, and reactive fetal heart rate. While BPP is a useful tool for assessing fetal well-being, it is not specifically used for monitoring the fetus of an Rh-negative sensitized mother. Fetal blood sampling (Option B) , also known as cordocentesis or percutaneous umbilical blood sampling (PUBS), is a diagnostic procedure in which a sample of fetal blood is obtained from the umbilical cord for laboratory analysis. It is typically performed to assess specific fetal conditions, such as genetic disorders or fetal anemia. Although Rh sensitization can lead to fetal anemia, fetal blood sampling is not the primary investigation used for monitoring Rh-negative sensitized mothers. There is no specific diagnostic test called \"amniospectometry\" (Option C) in modern obstetrics. It may refer to the assessment of amniotic fluid volume, which can be evaluated using various methods, including ultrasound measurement of amniotic fluid index (AFI) or single deepest pocket (SDP). While monitoring amniotic fluid volume is important in certain situations, it is not the specific investigation used for Reference: Williams Obstetrics, 26th edition, Page 262, 263",

      "explanation": "Correct Answer: B) Gestational diabetes Explanation: As the second baby given in the image is a healthy newborn the condition described in the image is fetal macrosomia The exact molecular mechanisms behind fetal macrosomia are not fully understood, but fetal hyperinsulinemia is a known contributing factor. Insulin-like growth factors, leptin, and other adipokines play crucial roles in regulating placental development and function. Maternal obesity is a significant factor in the development of fetal macrosomia. Additionally, some theories propose that maternal obesity may influence the growth of fetal cardiomyocytes, potentially leading to fetal cardiomyopathy or even congenital heart disease. Option A) Intake of Phenytoin: Phenytoin is an antiepileptic medication. While the use of certain antiepileptic drugs during pregnancy may pose risks to the developing fetus, such as congenital malformations, this option does not specifically indicate any complications for the mother. Option C) Intake of ACE inhibitors : ACE inhibitors are a type of medication used to treat conditions like high blood pressure.

      },
      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: A) Renal agenesis Explanation: Renal agenesis refers to the absence or underdevelopment of one or both kidneys. It can result in reduced or absent urine production, leading to oligohydramnios. Oligohydramnios is characterized by a decreased amniotic fluid volume, which is assessed through ultrasound examination. The decreased amniotic fluid can be observed as a small gestational sac size or less fluid visible around the fetus. Fetal anemia (Option B) is not a likely cause of oligohydramnios. Fetal anemia can lead to hydrops fetalis, which is characterized by excessive accumulation of fluid in the fetus and may result in polyhydramnios (increased amniotic fluid). Barter syndrome (Option C) is a rare genetic disorder affecting renal tubular function. It is characterized by abnormal salt and water reabsorption in the kidneys, leading to electrolyte imbalances. While it can cause renal abnormalities, oligohydramnios is not typically associated with Barter syndrome. Anencephaly (Option D) is a severe congenital malformation where the neural tube fails to close during early development, resulting in the absence of major portions of the brain and skull. Anencephaly is not directly related to oligohydramnios, although it can be associated with other anomalies that may affect amniotic fluid levels.

      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: C) Admit and start insulin Explanation: The patient in this scenario is diagnosed with gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) based on the oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) values, where the fasting glucose is ≥ 92 mg/dl, which is diagnostic. Insulin is the drug of choice for managing gestational diabetes, as it does not cross the placenta, effectively controlling blood glucose levels in the mother and reducing risks for the fetus. Incorrect Options: Oral hypoglycemics (Option A) , such as metformin or glyburide, are not typically used as first-line treatment for GDM, particularly because they can cross the placenta and may carry risks for the fetus, including potential hypoglycemia. Reassurance (Option B) alone is insufficient in the management of gestational diabetes. It requires active monitoring and treatment to maintain appropriate glycemic control to prevent complications such as fetal macrosomia and neonatal hypoglycemia. Induction of labor (Option D) at 32 weeks is premature and not advisable. The fetal lungs may not be adequately developed, and induction should be considered only after 37 weeks if necessary.

This approach helps to minimize the risk of hemolytic disease of the newborn by reducing the amount of fetal blood that can mix with the maternal circulation. The appropriate timing of cord clamping varies based on clinical scenarios. Early cord clamping is specifically indicated in Rh-negative mothers to prevent allo-immunization. Eclamptic patient (Option A): In cases of eclampsia, the priority is often to stabilize the mother and deliver the baby promptly. Early cord clamping is not specifically indicated in this situation; management focuses more on the mother's condition and the baby's immediate needs. Diabetic patient (Option B): Early cord clamping is not a routine practice specifically for diabetic patients. The management of diabetic pregnancies often focuses on blood sugar control and monitoring, rather than the timing of cord clamping.

      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: B) Gestational Thrombocytopenia Explanation: The most common cause of thrombocytopenia in pregnancy is gestational thrombocytopenia, characterized by platelet counts less than 150,000/µL . It accounts for approximately 70-80% of all cases of thrombocytopenia during pregnancy. Immune Thrombocytopenic Purpura (Option A) : ITP is an autoimmune condition causing platelet destruction but accounts for a much smaller percentage of pregnancy-related thrombocytopenia cases. It typically presents earlier in pregnancy and may require specific treatment. HELLP Syndrome (Option C) : This severe variant of pre-eclampsia includes hemolysis, elevated liver enzymes, and low platelets. The patient's normal blood pressure and absence of other symptoms make this diagnosis unlikely. Pre-eclampsia (Option D) : This hypertensive disorder can cause thrombocytopenia but is not the most common cause. The patient's normal blood pressure and absence of proteinuria exclude this diagnosis. Reference: Williams Obstetrics, 26th Edition Page 1058-1059",

      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Correct answer: B) Proceed with emergency LSCS (Lower Segment Cesarean Section) Explanation: The situation in this scenario is cord presentation, and since the baby is term and the cervix is not fully dilated , the best management for this case is to proceed to cesarean section as definitive management. Cord presentation involves the umbilical cord being felt below the presenting part without membrane rupture. Both cord prolapse and cord presentation are obstetric emergencies, and the management is immediate delivery by emergency LSCS. The presenting part can be elevated to relieve cord compression (positional or with fingers if possible) till delivery is started or if the patient needs to be transferred. Management of cord prolapse is based on: Baby's status (living or dead) Baby's maturity Degree Living baby Definitive treatment Cesarean Section (Best option for mature, living babies) If immediate Safe Vaginal Delivery Possible: Head Engaged: Complete delivery with forceps (ventouse is less ideal). Breech Presentation: Complete delivery by breech extraction. If immediate Safe Vaginal Delivery Not Possible Minimise cord pressure until definitive treatment or transfer to a suitable hospital. Stop any ongoing oxytocin infusion. Bladder Filling: Use a Foley catheter to fill the bladder with 400–750 mL fluid—empty the bladder before cesarean delivery. Postural Treatment: Use an elevated Sims position with a pillow or wedge Cord Replacement: Place the cord back into the vagina to reduce vasospasm. Baby Dead Allow labour to proceed for spontaneous delivery. Rupturing the membranes (Option A) in this situation can lead to cord prolapse, which is a serious obstetric emergency. It is not advisable to intentionally rupture the membranes without a clear assessment and appropriate management plan. Oxytocin (Option B) is not the immediate solution in the presence of a prolapsed cord. The focus should be on relieving pressure on the cord and expediting delivery through emergency LSCS rather than initiating labor augmentation. Wait and watch (Option D) is not an option here since this case can proceed to cord prolapse and further complications endangering the baby.",

Polyhydramnios In pregnancies without diabetes or hypertension, fetal anomalies such as anencephaly are commonly associated with polyhydramnios, occurring in about 50% of cases. The excessive production of amniotic fluid can be attributed to: Leakage from the exposed meninges Lack of fetal swallowing reflex Inhibition of fetal antidiuretic hormone, resulting in increased fetal urine output It can be categorized as follows based on the Amniotic Fluid Index (AFI): Mild: AFI = 25 to 29.9 cm Moderate: AFI = 30 to 34.9 cm Severe: AFI ≥ 35 cm Causes Polyhydramnios Fetal Factors Fetal anomalies (e.g., anencephaly, esophageal atresia) (Option A) Twin-to-twin transfusion syndrome (TTTS) Hydrops fetalis Maternal Factors Diabetes mellitus Cardiac disease Renal disease Placental Factors Chorioangioma Abruptio placenta (Option A) refers to the premature separation of the placenta from the uterine wall before delivery. It typically presents with sudden onset of painful vaginal bleeding, abdominal pain, and a firm/tender uterus. Hydrocephalus (Option B) refers to the accumulation of excess cerebrospinal fluid within the ventricles of the brain. It can cause an enlarged head circumference in the fetus and may present with additional symptoms such as macrocephaly, bulging fontanelles, and neurological signs. Fetal-maternal ascites (Option D) , also known as fetal hydrops, is a condition characterized by abnormal fluid accumulation in both the fetal and maternal compartments. Various factors, such as fetal cardiac abnormalities or chromosomal abnormalities, can cause it. While it can present with abdominal distension, it typically involves additional signs such as oedema, pleural effusion, or skin changes.

      "explanation": "Correct Answer: D) Preeclampsia Explanation: The patient presents with elevated blood pressure (150/90 mmHg), proteinuria (2+ on urine dipstick), and pedal edema, which are characteristic signs of Preeclampsia. Preeclampsia: Types of Preeclampsia: Early-Onset Preeclampsia: Occurs at <34 weeks gestation. Etiology: Defective placenta due to altered trophoblast invasion and placental ischemia. Features: Placental infarcts, arterial sclerosis, and hypoperfusion. Late-Onset Preeclampsia: Occurs at ≥ 34 weeks gestation. Etiology: Healthy placenta interacting with maternal factors, causing microvascular damage and endothelial dysfunction. Features: Maintained placental perfusion; managed expectantly until 37 weeks if stable. Clinical Presentations: New-onset headache unresponsive to medication. Visual disturbances. Right upper quadrant or epigastric pain, often with nausea or vomiting. Shortness of breath. Worsened swelling beyond baseline pregnancy-related symptoms. Physical Findings: Elevated blood pressure: SBP ≥ 140 mmHg or DBP ≥ 90 mmHg o n two measurements at least 4 hours apart. Severe hypertension: SBP ≥ 160 mmHg or DBP ≥ 110 mmHg. Edema: Dependent (lower extremities) or independent (face, hands). Lung examination for pulmonary disturbances. Tenderness in the right upper quadrant or epigastric area. Laboratory Tests: Proteinuria: Urine dipstick ≥ 2+ , 24-hour collection ≥ 300 mg, or protein/creatinine ratio ≥ 0.3. Thrombocytopenia: Platelet count <100 K/mm³. Impaired Liver Function: Liver enzymes >2 times the upper limit of normal. Renal Insufficiency: Serum creatinine ≥ 1.1 mg/dL or double baseline levels. Management: Antihypertensive Therapy: For severe hypertension (SBP ≥ 160 mmHg or DBP ≥ 110 mmHg): IV Medications: Labetalol, hydralazine. Oral Medications: Immediate-release nifedipine. For maintenance: PO Medications: Labetalol, extended-release nifedipine, or clonidine. Seizure Prophylaxis: First-Line: IV magnesium sulfate. Alternatives (if contraindicated): Levetiracetam or benzodiazepines for seizure treatment. Definitive Treatment: Delivery of the fetus is the only definitive cure. Delivery Timing: Gestational Hypertension or Preeclampsia without Severe Features: Deliver at 37 weeks. Severe Features at ≥ 34 weeks: Delivery after maternal stabilization. Severe Features <34 weeks: Expectant management with close monitoring and antenatal steroids for fetal lung maturation if stable. Placenta previa (Option A) is characterized by painless vaginal bleeding and the placenta covering the cervix, it does not typically present with high blood pressure, proteinuria, or pedal edema as seen in this case. Placenta abruptio (Option B) typically presents with abdominal pain and painful vaginal bleeding due to placental detachment, whereas the patient’s signs of pedal edema and proteinuria are more suggestive of preeclampsia. Spontaneous Abortion (Option C) occurs in the early stages of pregnancy and is associated with vaginal bleeding and cramping, not high blood pressure or proteinuria.

      },
      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: C) Upper segment cesarean section Explanation: Perimortem cesarean section (PMCS) is a life-saving emergency procedure performed on a woman in cardiopulmonary arrest or who is expected to die imminently. PMCS involves a classical upper-segment cesarean section where a vertical uterine incision is made. This is done to allow quick and efficient delivery, particularly in critical conditions. Indications for Upper Segment Cesarean Section (Classical Cesarean Incision) Risk of Lower Uterine Segment Complications Densely adherent bladder from previous surgery. Leiomyoma in the lower uterine segment. Cervical cancer involvement. Previous radical trachelectomy for cervical cancer. Placenta-Related Issues Placenta previa with anterior implantation. Placenta accreta syndrome. Maternal Obesity Massive obesity that prevents safe access to the lower uterine segment. Fetal Indications Transverse fetal lie with ruptured membrane and impacted shoulder. Transverse lie with the back-down position. Very small or breech fetus. Small fetal head entrapped by contracting uterine fundus following membrane rupture. Multiple fetuses that may be malpositioned or preterm. Large fetal malformation or conjoined twins requiring extra space. Perimortem Mother In cases of maternal cardiac arrest where immediate delivery is necessary to save the fetus, a classical cesarean section is often performed due to the urgency and limited time. Lower Segment Cesarean Section (LSCS) (Option A) is not performed during PMCS due to the urgency and anatomical constraints in a perimortem scenario. Pfannenstiel incision (Option B) , a horizontal incision in the lower abdomen, commonly used in routine cesareans, is time-consuming and unsuitable for perimortem cesarean section. Done in the operating theater (OT) (Option D): PMCS can be performed anywhere, including outside an OT, as time is of critical importance. Guidelines do not mandate that it must be done in a formal surgical setting. Reference: NCBI Bookshelf - Apgar Scores . 2020 ECC Guidelines Highlights .",

Symptoms of end-organ involvement: Epigastric pain, headache, and blurring of vision. She is also in active labor with cervical dilatation. Management Plan: Antihypertensives: Administer labetalol, nifedipine, or hydralazine to bring down BP. Seizure Prophylaxis: Use magnesium sulfate (MgSO I ) to prevent eclampsia. Delivery/Termination of Pregnancy: Delivery is the definitive treatment for pre-eclampsia, and since the patient is already in labor, termination of pregnancy should proceed to protect both maternal and fetal health. Algorithm for Treating Preeclampsia Initial Evaluation Perform comprehensive maternal and fetal evaluation. CBC with platelet estimate, serum creatinine, LDH, AST, ALT, and proteinuria testing. Fetal evaluation: USG for estimated fetal weight, amniotic fluid volume, and fetal antepartum testing. Decision for Delivery vs Expectant Management 34+ Weeks Gestation: Deliver promptly upon maternal stabilization or with labor/prelabor rupture of membranes; do not delay for steroid administration. Before 34 Weeks Gestation with Severe Preeclampsia: Consider expectant management in a tertiary care setting if maternal and fetal conditions are stable. 37+ Weeks Gestation with Gestational Hypertension or Preeclampsia Without Severe Features: Opt for delivery rather than expectant management upon diagnosis. Before 37 Weeks Gestation with Gestational Hypertension or Preeclampsia Without Severe Features: Managed as an outpatient; requires frequent fetal and maternal evaluation. Deliver only if specific conditions necessitate immediate intervention. Management During Expectant Management Closely monitor maternal and fetal conditions. Serial laboratory testing: CBC, liver enzymes, serum creatinine. Use antihypertensive therapy for acute-onset severe hypertension (systolic ≥ 160 mm Hg or diastolic ≥ 110 mm Hg).

      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "injury. Correct Answer: A) Elective C-section has no role in reducing the incidence of brachial plexus injury. Explanation: An elective C-section has been shown to be protective against traumatic injuries, such as brachial plexus injury, particularly in macrosomic babies born to mothers with diabetes. Indications for C-section in diabetic pregnancies include fetal macrosomia (>4.5 kg), unsatisfactory labor progression, complicated diabetes, fetal compromise, and other obstetric complications like preeclampsia or polyhydramnios. Statement B is true: In planned deliveries, the bedtime dose of intermediate-acting insulin is given, but the morning dose is withheld due to reduced insulin requirements post-delivery. Statement C is true: During active labor, if RBS is <70 mg%, 5% dextrose (D5) is administered at 100-150 ml/hr to maintain RBS levels above 100 mg%. Before labor initiation, normal saline is typically used for IV infusion. Statement D is true: This statement is true.

      },
      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: A) Loss of knee jerk Explanation: The first sign of magnesium sulfate toxicity is the loss of knee jerk reflex. This occurs at a plasma concentration of about 7-10 meq/l. Magnesium Sulfate Toxicity Monitor magnesium sulfate toxicity by observing deep tendon reflexes, respiratory status, and urine output (primarily excreted by kidneys) Impaired kidney function can lead to toxicity. Loss of patellar or knee-jerk reflexes at ~12 mg/dL is an early warning sign. Serum Magnesium Testing: Routine testing is not recommended. Test 4-6 hours after starting infusion to adjust rate (target: 4-7 mEq/L or 4.8-8.4 mg/dL). Elevated serum creatinine ( ≥ 1.0 mg/dL) to assess kidney function. Check for toxicity signs (diminished reflexes, breathing issues) to confirm diagnosis and guide treatment. Administer fluids cautiously to avoid overload and pulmonary edema. Adverse Effects of Magnesium Sulfate Mechanism: Acts as a smooth muscle relaxant. Serum Magnesium Level Effect 5–9 mg/dL Therapeutic range 9 mg/dL Loss of patellar or knee-jerk reflexes 12 mg/dL Respiratory depression occurs at ~12 mEq/L (14.4 mg/dL) due to muscle paralysis 30 mg/dL Cardiac arrest Management of Magnesium Toxicity: Immediate Actions: Administer 10 mL 10% calcium gluconate IV over 3 minutes to reverse mild to moderate respiratory depression. Discontinue magnesium sulfate. Further Steps: Administer furosemide to increase urinary excretion. Severe respiratory depression requires intubation and mechanical ventilation. The effects of IV calcium may be short-lived if steady-state toxicity is present. Hypotension (Option B) is not typically the first sign of magnesium sulfate toxicity. While magnesium sulfate can cause some vasodilation, significant hypotension is usually a later manifestation of severe toxicity. Respiratory depression (Option C) is a potential complication of magnesium sulfate toxicity, but it is not the first sign. As toxicity progresses, respiratory depression can occur, leading to shallow or slowed breathing, which can result in respiratory distress if left untreated. Reduced muscle tone (hypotonia) (Option D) can occur with magnesium sulfate toxicity, but it is not typically the first sign. Hypotonia develops as toxicity worsens, affecting neuromuscular function.

It involves administering a 75g glucose bolus to the patient, and blood glucose is measured at specific intervals (typically at fasting, 0.5hr, 1hr, 1.5hr, and 2hr). A normal response is characterized by: Glucose Peak: A rise in blood glucose levels, peaking approximately 1 hour after glucose ingestion. Return to Baseline: A gradual decline, with glucose levels returning to baseline or near baseline by 2 hours, reflecting normal insulin action. Graph D demonstrates this expected rise and fall, indicating a normal physiological response to glucose. Graph A (Option A): Severe DM: This graph represents a response to an Oral Glucose Tolerance Test (OGTT) in a person with severe diabetes mellitus.. In individuals with severe diabetes, the blood glucose levels are expected to be significantly elevated throughout the test, resulting in a very different curve than a normal response. Graph B (Option B): Moderate DM: This graph represents a response to an OGTT in a person with moderate diabetes mellitus. Similar to Graph A, it indicates diabetes and does not represent a normal response to an OGTT. LAG curve (Option C): lag storage curve. Fasting glucose level is normal. Rises rapidly in the 1/2 to 1 hour and exceeds the renal threshold and comes to normal value in minutes. It is seen in early diabetes, hyperthyroidism. Learning Objective: Interpretation of OGTT A curve is plotted by placing time on the X-axis and plasma glucose level on the Y-axis, referred to as the Glucose Tolerance Curve (GTC). 1. Normal Response A typical normal response includes the following features: Initial fasting glucose is within normal limits. The highest peak value is reached within 1 hour. The highest value does not exceed the renal threshold (160–180 mg/dl). Fasting glucose levels are restored within 2–2.5 hours. No glucose or ketone bodies are detected in any urine specimen. 2. Response of Diabetic Patients Features include: Fasting blood glucose is elevated above 110 mg/dl. The highest value is",

      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "and lowering the BP Correct Answer: C) It has an inhibitory effect on the cerebral corte,x thereby preventing seizures and lowering the BP Explanation: MgSO4 has an inhibitory effect on the cerebral cortex and prevents seizures, but it does not lower blood pressure directly. While MgSO4 is used as an anticonvulsant in eclampsia and severe pre-eclampsia, it does not have a significant effect on blood pressure control. Its action is more related to neurological protection, such as stabilizing cell membranes and inhibiting calcium influx into neurons, which prevents seizures. Magnesium sulfate's hypotensive effect is secondary to vascular smooth muscle relaxation, but this is not its primary use. It is not used as a first-line agent for blood pressure management, and its use for lowering blood pressure is more incidental. Magnesium Sulfate (MgSO4): MOA NMDA Receptor Blockade Calcium Channel Blockade: reduces calcium influx into neurons. Vasodilation: Improves cerebral blood flow and reduces cerebral edema, dilates uterine arteries, increases endothelial prostacyclin production and inhibits platelet activation. Uses Prevent seizures in severe preeclampsia and eclampsia. Prevent recurrent seizures in eclampsia. Tocolytic effect (delaying preterm labor) Neuroprotective: Protects the preterm baby's brain from damage by reducing the risk of cerebral palsy Therapeutic Range To control fits the optimum serum magnesium is 4.8–8.4 mg/dL (4–7 mEq/L). Deep tendon reflex loss at 9 mg/dL (>7 mEq/L). C/I Myasthenia gravis, hypocalcemia, moderate-to-severe renal failure, cardiac ischemia, heart block, myocarditis. Administration and Dosage Administer: Intravenously or intramuscularly. Loading dose: 4–6 g IV over 20–30 minutes. (Zuspan or Sibai regimen) Maintenance: 1–2 g/hour IV. Monitor urine output and reflexes. Dosage Adjustment Adjust for renal dysfunction. Regimen Loading Dose Maintenance Dose Pritchard (IV and IM) Administer 4 g IV over 3-5 mins (20 mL of 20% MgSO4 solution) Follow with 10 g of 50% MgSO4 solution: 5 g (10 mL of 50% solution) in each buttock as deep IM injection with 1 mL of 2% lidocaine in the same syringe. 5g IM with 1 mL of 2% lidocaine in alternate buttocks every 4 hours; continue for 24 hours after birth or last convulsion Zuspan (IV only) Administer 4-6 g IV over 15- 20 mins (20 mL of 20% magnesium sulfate solution). If convulsions recur after 15 mins, give 2g IV (10 mL of 20% MgSO4 solution) over 5 mins. 1-2 g IV infusion per hour (5 mL of 20% solution); continue for 24 hours after childbirth or last convulsion Before Administration: Ensure respiratory rate is at least 16 per minute (not depressed) Confirm patellar reflexes are present. Verify urinary output is at least 30 ml per hour over 4 hours. Magnesium Sulfate Toxicity Monitor magnesium sulfate toxicity by observing deep tendon reflexes, respiratory status, and urine output (primarily excreted by kidneys) Impaired kidney function can lead to toxicity. Loss of patellar reflexes at ~12 mg/dL is an early warning sign. Serum Magnesium Testing: Routine testing is not recommended. Test 4-6 hours after starting infusion to adjust rate (target: 4-7 mEq/L or 4.8-8.4 mg/dL). Elevated serum creatinine ( ≥ 1.0 mg/dL) to assess kidney function. Check for toxicity signs (diminished reflexes, breathing issues) to confirm diagnosis and guide treatment. Administer fluids cautiously to avoid overload and pulmonary edema. Adverse Effects of Magnesium Sulfate Mechanism: Acts as a smooth muscle relaxant. Serum Magnesium",
