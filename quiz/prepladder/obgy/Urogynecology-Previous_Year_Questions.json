      "question": "A female undergoes a methylene blue 3 swab test and the middle swab is stained with blue. What is the likely diagnosis?",
      "options": {
        "A": "Uterovaginal fistula",
        "B": "Vesicovaginal fistula",
        "C": "Vesicouterine fistula",
        "D": "Ureterovaginal fistula"
      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: B) Vesicovaginal Fistula Explanation: The middle swab being stained blue indicates a communication between the bladder and vagina, suggesting a vesicovaginal fistula. Vesicovaginal fistula (VVF): An abnormal opening between the bladder and the vagina, resulting in continuous urinary incontinence. Symptoms: Constant dribbling of urine (true incontinence), genital area excoriation, depression, secondary amenorrhoea, and bladder stones. Classification of VVFs: Simple Fistulas: Small in size ( ≤ 0.5 cm). Present as single, non-radiated fistulas. Complex Fistulas: Large in size ( ≥ 2.5 cm). Often result from chronic diseases or radiotherapy. May include previously failed fistula repairs. Diagnosis: Methylene Blue - Three-swab Test: A catheter is inserted into the bladder through the urethra, and the vaginal cavity is packed with three sterile swabs. Dilute methylene blue dye (50-100 ml) is injected into the bladder. Uppermost swab gets wet but not stained : The leak is from the ureter, indicating a ureterovaginal fistula.(Option D) Middle swab gets stained : The leak is from the bladder, indicating a vesicovaginal fistula. Lowermost swab gets stained : The leak is from the urethra, indicating a urethrovaginal fistula.(Option A) Urine culture, cystoscopy, intravenous pyelography (IVP), ureteric catheterization, and sonography. Management: Conservative: Indwelling catheter and antibiotics for 3-4 weeks, followed by waiting 3 months for tissue healing before surgery. Surgical Repair: Vaginal repair (Latzko procedure, Chassar Moir technique) for most cases. For large fistulas or failed repairs, abdominal approach may be required. In cases of extensive bladder loss or failed repairs, urinary diversion techniques (e.g., sigmoid colon, ileal loop bladder) may be needed. Vesicouterine Fistulas (Option C) are rare connections between the uterus and bladder, often after cesarean sections. Symptoms include urinary incontinence, hematuria. Diagnosis is made through cystoscopy or by injecting methylene blue into the bladder, with dye exiting the uterine cervix confirming the fistula.",

      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: A) Enterocele repair Explanation: McCall’s culdoplasty is done in Enterocele repair. Enterocele: Herniation of the pouch of Douglas into the rectovaginal septum, often associated with uterine prolapse. Location: Upper one-third of the posterior vaginal wall: Enterocele. Lower two-thirds: Rectocele. Clinical Features: Bowel incontinence Constipation/diarrhea Pelvic discomfort Sexual dysfunction Mass descending per vaginam Surgical Procedures: McCall Culdoplasty: Fixes the uterosacral and Mackenrodt's ligaments to the vaginal vault and peritoneum of the pouch of Douglas. Moschcowitz Repair: Obliterates the cul-de-sac of the pouch of Douglas via several purse-string sutures, often during abdominal surgery. Halban’s Procedure: Obliterates the peritoneal sac using vertical sutures, transvaginal or abdominal route.

      "question": "A pregnant lady at 20 weeks of gestation presents with acute onset fever and pain in the right lumbar region, associated with chills, nausea, and vomiting. Urinalysis reveals the presence of E. coli, and a diagnosis of acute pyelonephritis is made. Which of the following is incorrect regarding the management of acute pyelonephritis in pregnancy?",
      "options": {
        "A": "Hospitalize, send urine and blood cultures, and start on antibiotics.",
        "B": "Oral antibiotics once afebrile.",
        "C": "Maintain urine output >60 mL/hr; intravenous crystalloids can be given.",
        "D": "Discharge if afebrile for 72 hours; continue antibiotics for 6 days."
      },
      "correct_answer": "D",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: D) Discharge if afebrile for 72 hours; continue antibiotics for 6 days. Explanation: The patient can be discharged once afebrile for 24 hours, not 72 hours, and antibiotics must be continued for 7 to 10 days, not just 6 days. Management of Acute Pyelonephritis in Pregnancy: Hospitalization: Recommended for all patients, except for rare uncomplicated cases that may be managed outpatient. Culture: Obtain urine and blood cultures (if fever >39°C) to identify the causative organism, typically E. coli. (Option A ruled out) Intravenous Hydration: Aggressive hydration with intravenous crystalloids is crucial to maintain adequate urine output ( ≥ 60 mL/hr) to prevent dehydration and maintain renal function. (Option C ruled out) Antibiotics: Start with intravenous antibiotics: Ampicillin plus gentamicin, cefazolin, or ceftriaxone. Once the patient is afebrile, transition to oral antibiotics. (Option B ruled out) Duration of Antibiotic Therapy: Continue antibiotics for 7 to 10 days to ensure complete resolution of the infection. Monitoring: Monitor vital signs, including blood pressure, pulse, temperature, and oxygen saturation. Also monitor urine output to detect signs of worsening sepsis. Follow-up: Repeat urine culture 1-2 weeks after completing antibiotic therapy to ensure eradication of the infection. Renal Sonography: If there is persistent infection or lack of improvement within 48-72 hours, renal sonography may be performed to rule out urinary tract abnormalities (e.g., obstruction, calculi).

        "D": "Trauma and dressing"
      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "packing with glycerine and acriflavine Correct Answer: B) Venous congestion and reduction of the prolapsed part into the vagina and daily packing with glycerine and acriflavine Explanation: This is a case of Decubitus ulcer and it is seen often in a patient with uterovaginal prolapse, which occurs due to localized tissue damage and venous congestion. Treatment of this ulcer is often done with moist vaginal packing using acriflavine and glycerin-soaked roller gauze. Complications of prolapse: Kinking of ureter Chronic UTI Decubitus ulcer Stress incontinence Cancer of vagina Decubitus Ulcer: [1] Decubitus ulcer is a complication of pelvic organ prolapse. It usually occurs when the disease has advanced and it is a feature of long-standing uterovaginal prolapse. Affected women are usually concerned not just about their prolapse but about the developing ulcer. This ulcer has been attributed to venous congestion in the affected organ. Venous congestion causes edema of the local tissue which may decrease tissue strength thereby making it more friable. All these may reduce the strength of the vaginal tissue. Also, friction between the prolapsed organ and the patient's clothes may play a role. It is also of concern when surgery is contemplated because the affected tissues appear friable which may cause difficulties during vaginal hysterectomy. This may eventually lead to a delay in surgery thereby depriving the affected women of the cure for their physical and psychosocial problems. In women with uterovaginal prolapse, ulcers may be associated with cervical intraepithelial neoplasia and cervical malignancy. Also, decubitus ulcers may be a source of infection with its attendant risk of postoperative infection. Treatment is reduction of the prolapsed part into the vagina and daily packing with glycerine and acriflavine. Malignancy and excision (Option A): Decubitus ulcers in prolapse are not caused by malignancy, and excision is not a standard treatment for such ulcers. Infection and antibiotics (Option C): While infection can complicate a decubitus ulcer, it is not the primary cause. Therefore, antibiotics alone are not the appropriate treatment in this case. Trauma and dressing (Option D): Trauma can contribute to the development of a decubitus ulcer, but it is not specified in the given scenario. Dressing alone would not address the underlying cause of venous congestion in uterovaginal prolapse.",

      "explanation": "Correct Answer: C) Stress incontinence Explanation: The clinical manifestations indicate Stress Urinary Incontinence (SUI), which is involuntary leakage of urine during physical activities involving increasd intra-abdominal pressure. Urine leakage with increased intra-abdominal pressure (coughing, sneezing) Associated pelvic organ prolapse (uterine prolapse with cystocele) Risk factors present: multiparity, postmenopausal status Physical examination shows grade II/III uterine prolapse Urinary incontinence is the most common complication associated with pelvic organ prolapse. Risk Factors: Age and menopause Multiparity Obesity Smoking Constipation Pelvic organ prolapse Pregnancy Puerperium Grades of Stress Incontinence: Grade I: Severe stress Grade II: Moderate stress Grade III: Mild stress Overflow incontinence (Option A): Overflow incontinence presents with constant dribbling due to bladder outlet obstruction Urge incontinence (Option B): Urge incontinence involves sudden, strong urge to urinate with an overactive bladder. Neurogenic bladder (Option D): Neurogenic bladder results from disrupted nerve signals between the bladder and brain, causing dribbling urine & inability to perceive that the bladder is full.

      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: C) Stress incontinence Explanation: Leaking urine on coughing, combined with uterine prolapse and cystocele, indicates a diagnosis of stress incontinence. Stress urinary incontinence: Descent of the bladder neck below the levator ani muscles and loss of the urethrovesical angle (70–80%) cause funnelling of the bladder neck and upper urethra. Causes of stress urinary incontinence: Atony of pelvic floor muscles Damage to pudendal nerve during vaginal delivery Intrinsic sphincter defect (20-25%) Detrusor overactivity Risk factors: Age Obesity (BMI>20) Smoking Pregnancy Cognitive and functional impairment Chronically increased abdominal pressure (Chronic cough, constipation, occupational lifting) Overflow incontinence (Option A) refers to the inability to completely empty the bladder, leading to continuous or frequent dribbling of urine. It is typically caused by bladder outlet obstruction or bladder dysfunction. Urge incontinence (Option B) is characterized by a sudden and intense urge to urinate, followed by an involuntary loss of urine. It is commonly associated with an overactive bladder and is often triggered by a specific stimulus or without any identifiable cause. Neurogenic bladder (Option D) refers to bladder dysfunction caused by a neurological problem that interferes with the normal nerve control of bladder function.
