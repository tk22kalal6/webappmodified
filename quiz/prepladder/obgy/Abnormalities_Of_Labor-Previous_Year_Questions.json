      "correct_answer": "D",
      "explanation": "maternal symphysis pubis or sacral promontory. ACOG Definition: Shoulder dystocia requires maneuvers beyond gentle traction to deliver the shoulders. Spong et al. Criteria: Head-to-body delivery time >60 seconds or the need for ancillary obstetric maneuvers (McRoberts, suprapubic pressure, rotational maneuvers, or hands’ and knees’ positioning). Key Indicator: Turtle sign (fetal head retracting against the perineum), often due to umbilical cord compression, making it an obstetric emergency. Risk Factors: History of shoulder dystocia Macrosomia (>4.5 kg), Diabetes, Obesity (BMI >30) Induced labor, Prolonged/Arrested labor Postmaturity, Multiparity, Mid-pelvic instrumental delivery Fetal ascites, Anencephaly Complications: Maternal Complications Neonatal Complications Soft tissue injuries : Lacerations of the bladder, urethra, vagina, anal sphincter, or rectum Nerve injury : Lateral femoral cutaneous neuropathy Postpartum hemorrhage Pelvic injury : Symphyseal separation Uterine rupture Fetal death Hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy (HIE) Fractures : Clavicle or humerus Neurologic injuries : Brachial plexus injury Diaphragmatic paralysis Facial nerve injury Horner syndrome (ptosis, miosis, anhidrosis) Management of Shoulder dystocia: Avoid fundal pressure (worsens impaction). Perform maneuvers sequentially: McRoberts maneuver : Involves hyperflexing and abducting the maternal thighs onto the abdomen, which rotates the symphysis pubis upward, straightens the sacrum, and increases the pelvic outlet, facilitating shoulder delivery. Suprapubic pressure : Applied downward and laterally; it helps reduce the bisacromial diameter and rotates the anterior shoulder toward the oblique pelvic diameter, facilitating shoulder descent. Wood’s corkscrew maneuver : Involves rotating the posterior shoulder 180° to the anterior using two fingers in the posterior vagina while applying simultaneous suprapubic pressure to aid entry into the pelvis. Delivery of posterior arm : The operator introduces a hand into the vagina, sweeps the posterior arm across the chest, and delivers it with gentle traction, reducing the shoulder width but potentially causing fractures. All-Fours (Gaskin) maneuver : The mother is placed on all fours, which increases the pelvic dimensions and allows the fetal position to shift, making it easier to apply downward traction to free the impacted shoulder. Last-resort interventions (if all fail): Cleidotomy: Deliberate fracture of the clavicle using finger pressure or scissors to reduce shoulder width, performed in extreme cases when other maneuvers fail. Zavanelli maneuver : Involves pushing the fetal head back into the uterus followed by emergency C-section, used as a last resort when vaginal delivery is impossible. Symphysiotomy: To widen the pelvis. Rarely done, in extreme cases where all other options fail",

      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: C) Suprapubic pressure Explanation: Shoulder dystocia occurs when shoulders fail to deliver with easy pulling within 60 seconds after delivery of the fetal head Suprapubic pressure (also known as Rubin's maneuver ) is applied if the McRoberts maneuver fails to deliver the shoulders Suprapubic pressure can release an impacted anterior shoulder Woods maneuver (Option A): This rotational maneuver is performed after failed suprapubic pressure, not immediately after McRoberts. The Woods maneuver involves rotating the posterior shoulder 180 degrees toward the fetal back and is considered a third-line intervention. Gaskin maneuver (Option B): Moving the mother to all-fours position is attempted after failure of anterior maneuvers. While effective, it requires time to reposition the mother and is not the immediate next step after McRoberts failure. Zavanelli maneuver (Option D): This is a last-resort emergency procedure involving cephalic replacement followed by cesarean delivery. It carries significant fetal and maternal morbidity and is only considered when all other maneuvers have failed. Reference: Williams Obstetrics, 26th Edition, Page 501-503",

      "question": "A 28-year-old G2P1 presents in active labor at 39 weeks gestation. On examination, the fetus is in occiput posterior (OP) position with reassuring fetal heart tones. She had a previous uncomplicated vaginal delivery. What is the most appropriate initial management?",
      "options": {

        "D": "Forceps rotation"
      },
      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: A) Proceed with normal vaginal delivery Explanation: Occiput posterior (OP) position, while a malposition, does not automatically necessitate surgical intervention. Normal vaginal delivery should be attempted first in the absence of other complications. OP position occurs in approximately 10% of vertex presentations Most OP positions can successfully deliver vaginally Fetal heart tones are typically heard more centrally due to fetal back position Previous successful vaginal delivery is a positive prognostic factor External cephalic version (Option C): External cephalic version (ECV) is a procedure that turns a breech baby into a head-down position. This procedure is used for breech presentations, not for OP position. Immediate cesarean section (Option B): Not indicated for OP position. This would be overly aggressive management when vaginal delivery is often successful. Forceps rotation (Option D): Should not be the initial management. It should only be considered if there's failure to progress after attempting vaginal delivery. Reference: Williams Obstetrics, 26th Edition, 433-444 https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK567727/",

        "D": "Breech Presentation"
      },
      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: C) Shoulder Dystocia Explanation: Shoulder dystocia occurs when the fetal shoulders fail to deliver shortly after the head has emerged , despite gentle pulling. This condition is typically diagnosed if the shoulders do not deliver within 60 seconds after the head. N ormal Delivery Time: Under normal circumstances, the shoulders should deliver within 20-25 seconds after the fetal head. Incidence: Occurs in approximately 1% of all deliveries and can lead to significant neonatal morbidity and mortality. Risk Factors: Large babies (macrosomia) > 4 kg Post-term pregnancy Diabetic mothers Anencephaly (due to absence of pituitary function leading to delayed labor onset and larger babies) Cephalopelvic Disproportion (CPD) (Option A) occurs when the baby's head or body is too large to fit through the mother's pelvis. It is typically diagnosed before or during labor due to the lack of progress in labor rather than after the head is delivered. Occipito-posterior Position (Option B) While occipito-posterior positioning can lead to a longer and more difficult labor but is not characterized by the shoulders getting stuck after the head is delivered. Breech presentation (Option D) occurs when the baby is positioned with the buttocks or feet first rather than the head. This is identified before delivery and managed differently. It does not involve the head being delivered first followed by stuck shoulders. Reference: Williams Obstetrics, 26th Edition Page 501-502",

      },
      "correct_answer": "D",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: D) Head on perineum Explanation: Head on Perineum typically corresponds to station +5, where the fetal head is visible at the vaginal opening and ready for delivery. Outlet forceps are appropriate at this stage. Operative Vaginal Delivery Prerequisites and Classification According to Station and Rotation: Procedure Criteria Outlet forceps Scalp is visible at the introitus without separating the labia Fetal skull has reached pelvic floor Fetal head is at or on perineum Head is OA or OP or Head is right or left OA or OP position but rotation ≤ 45 degrees Low forceps (2 types) Fetal station is ≥ +2 cm but not on the pelvic floor, and: (a) Rotation ≤ 45 degrees is required or (b) Rotation >45 degrees is required Midforceps Fetal station is between 0 and +2 cm Prerequisites Engaged head Vertex presentation Known fetal head position CPD not suspected Fetal weight estimated Experienced operator Ruptured membranes Completely dilated cervix Adequate anesthesia Emptied maternal bladder No fetal coagulopathy No fetal demineralization disorder Informed consent completed Willingness to abandon OVD CPD = cephalopelvic disproportion; OA = occiput anterior; OP = occiput posterior; OVD = operative vaginal delivery. Head 1/5th palpable per abdomen (Option A): This indicates that the fetal head is still significantly above the pelvic outlet, making it unsafe for outlet forceps application. At this level, the head is too high for outlet forceps, which could result in maternal or fetal trauma. 0 station (Option B): At this level, the fetal head is at the ischial spines, which is too high for outlet forceps. This position would require mid-cavity rather than outlet forceps if operative delivery is needed. Station +2 (Option C): While this indicates descent below the ischial spines, it is still not advanced enough for outlet forceps. Outlet forceps require the head to be visible at the introitus with perineal distention. Reference: Williams Obstetrics, 26th Edition Page 533-544",

      "question": "In a 35-year-old pregnant woman at 32 weeks of gestation, which of the following conditions is oxytocin contraindicated for?",
      "options": {
        "A": "Placenta covering internal os",
        "B": "Induction of labor in post-term pregnancy",
        "C": "Augmentation of labor in case of slow progress",
        "D": "Preterm labor with cervical dilation of 3 cm"
      },
      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: A) Placenta covering internal os Explanation: Placenta previa, where the placenta partially or completely covers the internal os , is a contraindication for oxytocin use. In this condition, inducing or augmenting labor with oxytocin can lead to severe bleeding. Oxytocin: Indications: Antepartum Indications (FDA-approved): For mothers with preeclampsia, maternal diabetes, or premature rupture of membranes. For mothers with an inactive uterus requiring stimulation to start labor. For inevitable or incomplete abortions in the second trimester. Postpartum Indications (FDA-approved): To help deliver the placenta during the third stage of labor. To control postpartum hemorrhage. Non-FDA-approved Indications: Treatment of delayed orgasm. Inducing sexual arousal. Treatment of autism (potential role in improving social skills but requires further studies). Contraindications: Hypersensitivity Contraindications for Vaginal Deliveries: Active genital herpes infection. Vasa previa (blood vessels in the membranes). Placenta previa. Invasive cervical cancer. Prolapse or presentation of the umbilical cord. Fetal Abnormalities: Fetus in an abnormal position, such as transverse lie. Fetal distress when delivery is not imminent. Pelvic and Uterine Issues: Inadequate pelvic size for vaginal delivery. Hyperactive or hypertonic uterus. Induction of labor in post-term pregnancy (Option B) : Oxytocin is commonly used for labor induction in post-term pregnancies (beyond 40 weeks). It helps initiate contractions and progress labor safely, making it an appropriate choice in this scenario. Augmentation of labor in case of slow progress (Option C) : Oxytocin is frequently used to augment labor when progress is slow. By strengthening contractions, it helps move labor forward effectively. Unless contraindications like placenta previa or fetal distress are present, this is a standard and appropriate use of oxytocin. Preterm labor with cervical dilation of 3 cm (Option D) : In cases of preterm labor, oxytocin may be used to enhance contractions and ensure labor progresses safely, especially when delivery is inevitable. A cervical dilation of 3 cm indicates that labor has started, and oxytocin could be considered for augmentation if deemed safe by the healthcare provider.

        "A": "4 contractions in 20 minutes and 8 contractions in 60 minutes with changes in the cervix.",
        "B": "Cervical dilatation > 2 cm. More than 80 percent effaced cervix. Cervix posterior in position.",
        "C": "More than 80 percent effaced cervix.",
        "D": "Cervix posterior in position."
      },
      "correct_answer": "D",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: D) Cervix posterior in position. Explanation: The diagnostic criteria for preterm labor (PTL) do not include a posterior cervix as a defining feature. A posterior cervix is typically associated with a lower Bishop’s scor e and indicates a lower likelihood of preterm labor. On the other hand, a cervix in the anterior or midline position is associated with a higher likelihood of preterm labor, as these positions favor cervical dilation and effacement. Diagnostic Criteria for Preterm Labor: Contractions: Regular uterine contractions occurring at least once every 10 minutes, or 4 contractions in 20 minutes, or 8 contractions in 60 minutes, with or without pain. (Option A ruled out) Cervical Changes: Cervical dilation > 2 cm. (Option B ruled out) Cervical effacement > 80%. (Option C ruled out) Cervical length (on TVS) < 2.6 cm. Funneling of the internal os > 1 cm. Symptoms: Pelvic pressure, backache, vaginal discharge, or bleeding per vaginum. Predictors of Preterm Labor: Clinical predictors: History of prior preterm birth. Multiple pregnancies. Active genital tract infection. Biophysical predictors: Uterine contractions >24/hour. Bishop score >4. Cervical length <25 mm on transvaginal ultrasound. Biochemical predictors: Positive fetal fibronectin (fFN) (>60 ng/mL) in cervico-vaginal discharge. Elevated levels of IL-6, IL-8, and TNF-alpha.

      "question": "A 26-year-old pregnant woman, on examination, was found to have infra-umbilical flattening. The fetal heart sounds were heard over the lateral side. What could be the fetal presentation/ position?",

        "D": "Right dorso-anterior"
      },
      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: C) Occipitoposterior Explanation: The fetal presentation/position is likely Occipitoposterior , as infra-umbilical flattening and lateral fetal heart tones suggest a posterior fetal position. Occipito-posterior (OP): Occurs when the occiput is located posteriorly, either over the sacroiliac joint or directly above the sacrum, with the fetus in a vertex presentation. Clinical findings: Inspection: Flattening of the abdomen below the umbilicus, known as infra-umbilical flattening, may be observed. Pelvic examination: Fetal head is not engaged, and the sinciput (cephalic prominence) is not easily palpable. Auscultation: Fetal heart tones are typically heard over the flanks, but in the direct OP position, they are heard in the midline. Variants of OP position: Left OP position: The occiput is directed towards the left sacroiliac joint (fourth vertex position). Right OP position: The occiput faces the right sacroiliac joint, which is more common than the left OP position (third vertex position). Direct OP position: The occiput points directly towards the sacrum. Brow (Option A): In a brow presentation, the fetal head is partially extended, presenting the brow. This position, with a larger head diameter, does not align with infra-umbilical flattening and lateral fetal heart tones, which are more typical of an occipitoposterior position. Knee (Option B): In a knee presentation, one or both fetal knees are present at the maternal pelvis. This rare presentation is not consistent with infra-umbilical flattening and lateral fetal heart tones, which are more typical of an occipitoposterior position. Right dorso-anterior (Option D): In a right dorso-anterior presentation, the fetus lies transversely with the back towards the anterior, causing a wide abdomen and the head and breech to be felt in opposite iliac fossae, which occurs in a transverse lie.

        "D": "Do vaginal examination and find the fetal presentation"
      },
      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: C) Put her in Trendelenberg position Explanation: The Trendelenburg position (lying on the back with legs elevated higher than the head) would cause gravity to shift the fetus upwards into the uterine cavity, away from the prolapsed cord allowing pressure to be relieved. This would be the best immediate next action to be done by the midwife. In case of a prolapsed cord, the healthcare provider should be informed immediately, and the woman should be taken to the operating theatre (OT) for an emergency cesarean section (Option B) . This is to ensure a quick delivery and avoid further compression of the cord. A prolapsed umbilical cord is a medical emergency that occurs when the umbilical cord slips down into the birth canal ahead of the baby. This can potentially cut off the baby's oxygen supply, and immediate action is required. In the above scenario mentioned in the question, the next best management would be the change in position. Attempting to push the cord back inside the vagina (Option A) can compress it further, leading to decreased blood flow to the baby. This should not be done. While it's important to know the fetal presentation (Option D) , in the case of a prolapsed cord, the priority is to inform the doctor and initiate immediate management, which usually involves a cesarean section to deliver the baby promptly.

      },
      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "normal delivery Correct Answer: A) Breech identified for the first time during delivery is a contraindication for normal delivery Explanation: While a breech presentation (where the baby is positioned bottom-first instead of head-first) does increase the complexity and potential risks associated with vaginal delivery, it is not an absolute contraindication for normal vaginal delivery. In some cases, a breech presentation may be diagnosed for the first time during labor, and a skilled obstetrician may decide that a vaginal breech delivery can still be safely attempted. Breech deliveries should indeed be performed in a hospital where a facility for emergency cesarean delivery is available, as complications can arise during labor. (Option B ruled out) Continuous fetal heart rate (FHR) monitoring is essential during breech delivery (Option C ruled out) due to the increased risk of fetal distress, ensuring the well-being of the baby. A vaginal breech delivery must be managed by a skilled obstetrician (Option D ruled out) with specialized training, as breech deliveries require careful handling to prevent injury to the baby and mother.

      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: B) 4cm Explanation: A partograph is a graphical tool used to monitor the progress of labor. It helps healthcare providers track cervical dilatation, the descent of the presenting part, and other vital parameters during labor. The graph is divided into different sections, and plotting begins at a specific point in cervical dilatation. According to the standard practice, plotting on the partograph should start when the cervix is dilated at 4cm. This is considered the active phase of labor when regular contractions and progressive cervical dilation are expected. Starting the plot at 4cm allows for the assessment of the labor progress and helps identify any deviations or abnormalities that may require intervention. 2 cm dilation (Option A) indicates the early phase of labor, not yet active, where contractions are irregular, making it unsuitable for accurate monitoring of active labor. Delaying plotting until 7 cm dilation (Option C) may result in missed opportunities for early detection of labor abnormalities. While 6 cm dilatation (Option D) is within the active phase of labor, it is recommended to begin at 4 cm for more comprehensive monitoring of labor progress.

      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: A) External anal sphincter Explanation: The external anal sphincter is a muscular structure that surrounds the anal canal and is responsible for voluntary control of bowel movements. When an episiotomy extends beyond the perineal body, it can result in injury to the external anal sphincter, potentially leading to complications such as fecal incontinence. The ischiocavernosus muscle (Option B) is located in the perineal region and is involved in the erectile mechanism in males. The bulbospongiosus muscle (Option C) is also located in the perineal region and plays a role in the erectile mechanism as well as in the expulsion of urine and semen. While it may be involved in the episiotomy, it is less likely to be injured compared to the external anal sphincter. The urethral sphincter (Option D) is responsible for maintaining urinary continence and is located in close proximity to the vaginal area. While it can be affected during childbirth, an episiotomy extending beyond the perineal body is less likely to directly injure the urethral sphincter.

This type of pelvis is commonly associated with a favorable outcome for vaginal delivery, particularly when the baby is in the face-to-pubis position. Pelvic Types Feature Gynecoid (Option A) Android (Option C) Anthropoid Platypelloid (Option D) Shape Round or slightly oval Heart-shaped Oval (anteroposterior) Flattened oval (transverse) Prevalence Most common (~50%) ~20% ~25% Rare (~5%) Description Transversely oval pelvic inlet Broad, shallow sacrum Blunt, widely spaced ischial spines Wide subpubic angle (>90°) Triangular or heart-shaped pelvic inlet Flat, forward-inclined sacrum Prominent, closely spaced ischial spines Narrow subpubic angle (<70°) Oval pelvic inlet (anteroposterior > transverse) Long, narrow sacrum Less prominent, widely spaced ischial spines Narrow subpubic angle (~70°) Wide, flat pelvic inlet (transverse > anteroposterior) Short, flat sacrum Blunt, widely spaced ischial spines Wide subpubic angle (>90°) Obstetric Significance Ideal for vaginal delivery due to spacious cavity and optimal dimensions Increased risk of obstructed labor Associated with deep transverse arrest Favors occipito-posterior fetal positions Vaginal delivery usually possible Delayed engagement of the fetal head Higher likelihood of cesarean delivery",

      "question": "A 23-year-old G3 P1L1 A1 at 37 weeks of gestation with a previous history of emergency caesarean section and dilatation and curettage presents to the ER with labor pains. During abdominal examination, it was difficult to palpate fetal parts. Per vaginal examination revealed a 5 cm dilated cervix, and her vitals were: BP-80/60 mmHg, RR – 20/min, HR – 106/min, SpO2 – 97% on room air. CTG showed a non-reassuring variable fetal heart rate pattern. What is the most likely diagnosis?",

      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: B) Placental abruption Explanation: Placental abruption involves partial or complete detachment of the placenta from the uterine wall before delivery. This leads to severe abdominal pain, difficult palpation of fetal parts, hypotension, tachycardia, and non-reassuring fetal heart patterns, as seen in this patient. Abruptio placenta is a form of antepartum haemorrhage, where the bleeding occurs due to premature separation of the normally situated placenta. Pathogenesis: Bleeding occurs due to rupture of blood vessels in the decidua basalis. There is an accumulation of blood in the decidua. This causes the separation of the placenta, leading to Further bleeding. Thrombin generation from haemorrhage triggers the action of matrix metalloproteinases, inflammatory cytokines, and coagulation cascade (high risk of DIC). Fetal distress. Clinical features: Mild to moderate vaginal bleeding Abdominal pain Uterine tenderness Back pain Fetal distress Hypovolemic shock Frequent contractions Types of abruptio placenta: Revealed Most common type, where the bleeding from the placental detachment is visible and exits through the vagina. This is often associated with vaginal bleeding and abdominal pain. Concealed Bleeding is hidden behind the placenta and is not visible externally. Blood collects within the uterus, causing increased pressure and pain without visible bleeding. Mixed Involves both concealed and revealed bleeding. There is both internal and external bleeding, with some blood exiting through the vagina and some collecting behind the placenta.

The diagnosis is made after inspection of the placenta following delivery. 1 Bleeding PV + Abdominal pain (Uterine tenderness ±) Fetal heart sounds are normal 2 Bleeding PV + Abdominal pain (Uterine tenderness always +) Fetal distress 3 Bleeding PV + Abdominal pain (marked uterine tenderness) + Shock ± Coagulopathy Fetal death Comparison of findings in placenta previa and abruptio placentae: Placenta previa Abruptio placentae Clinical features Nature of bleeding Painless, causeless, and recurrent. Painful, often attributed to Pre-eclampsia or trauma, and continuous. Character of blood Bleeding is always revealed. Revealed, concealed, or usually mixed. General condition & anaemia Proportionate to visible blood loss. Out of proportion to the visible blood loss in the concealed or mixed variety. Features of eclampsia Not relevant. Present in one-third of the cases. Abdominal examination Height of the uterus Proportionate height to the gestational age. It may be disproportionately enlarged in concealed type.

Vaginal examination The placenta is felt on the lower segment (not to be done in a suspected case). The placenta is not felt on the lower segment. Blood clots should not be confused with placenta. Placenta previa (Option B) occurs when the placenta covers the cervix partially or completely. It typically presents with painless vaginal bleeding in the third trimester and no abdominal pain or tense uterus, making it unlikely in this scenario. Hydramnios (polyhydramnios) (Option",
