      "question": "A 32-year-old woman in her 16th week of gestation presents with abdominal discomfort and bloating. Ultrasound reveals bilateral cysts in the ovaries measuring 10 cm in diameter. Serum beta-hCG levels are significantly elevated. What is the most likely diagnosis?",

      "explanation": "beta-hCG levels is highly suggestive of theca lutein cysts . Elevated hCG is the main cause of the formation of theca lutein cysts Theca lutein cysts are often noted in cases of: Multiple gestations Hydatidiform moles Choriocarcinoma Induction of ovulation with gonadotropin (hCG) and clomiphene Non-neoplastic cysts are mostly treated conservatively. The types are: Follicular cysts Corpus luteal cysts Hemorrhagic cyst Theca lutein cysts Follicular cyst ( Option A): Follicular cysts form when an incompletely developed follicle fails to absorb fluid or during anovulation. They can be single or multiple, bilateral, and vary in size from small to large, but generally do not exceed 5.0 cm in diameter Corpus luteal cyst (Option B): Corpus luteum cysts never grow larger than 7 cm in size and are unilocular with clear fluid. Hemorrhagic cyst ( Option D): Hemorrhagic cysts are follicular hematomas and present as cysts. Old cysts contain tan-coloured material, which may be mistaken for endometriosis. A cyst may rupture into the peritoneal cavity, causing an acute abdomen that is mistaken for an ectopic pregnancy Reference: Shaw’s Textbook of Gynaecology, 17th Edition, Page 312-314",

Hence, Radiotherapy is mainly used in a palliative setting for recurrent ovarian cancer. It helps to alleviate symptoms such as pain and bleeding. It can also be employed to manage metastasis from ovarian cancer. In cervical cancer (Ca cervix), radiotherapy is a mainstay of treatment, whereas, for ovarian cancer, radiotherapy is useless as a primary treatment because of high morbidity.

      "question": "A 55-year-old postmenopausal woman presents with abdominal distension and discomfort. Transvaginal ultrasound confirms a complex ovarian mass. CA-125 levels are elevated. Further imaging and biopsy confirm the diagnosis of high-grade serous ovarian carcinoma. She undergoes primary debulking surgery, and the tumor is staged as advanced (Stage III) disease.

      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "epithelial ovarian cancer includes a combination of paclitaxel and carboplatin . These drugs are given intravenously every 3 weeks for six cycles. Chemotherapy for other types of ovarian carcinomas: Germ cell tumors: Bleomycin-Platinum-Etoposide (BEP) Regimen; Vincristine-Bleomycin-Platinum (VBP) Regimen. Sex cord tumors: Surgery alone sufficient. For BRCA-associated tumors, Platins+PARP ( Poly ADP Ribose Polymerase) inhibitors like Olaparib are used. Neoadjuvant Chemotherapy: For patients with advanced ovarian cancer, especially those who may not be ideal candidates for immediate surgery due to extensive disease, neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NACT) is an option. NACT involves administering chemotherapy before surgical intervention. Given as 3 cycles before surgery and 3 cycles after surgery. It increases the chances of optimal debulking - This surgery after initial neoadjuvant chemotherapy is called interval debulking . Note: Women relapsing after 6 months of primary chemotherapy - Platinum-sensitive ovarian cancer Women relapsing within 6 months of primary chemotherapy - Platinum-resistant ovarian cancer Methotrexate and leucovorin rescue (Option A): This regimen is used primarily for gestational trophoblastic disease. Vincristine, doxorubicin, and cyclophosphamide (VAC) (Option C): This combination is used for certain types of sarcomas. Cisplatin and etoposide (Option D): Commonly used for testicular cancer and small cell lung cancer. Reference: Williams Gynecology, 4th edition, Page 751.

Management would include detorsion, consideration for cystectomy or oophorectomy depending on the degree of necrosis of tissues or further, ovariopexy could be considered in the end. Ovarian torsion is an emergency that requires immediate surgery. The surgeon performs detorsion and ovariopexy , which involves attaching the ovary to the pelvic sidewall to prevent future torsion. Complications of Ovarian tumor Rupture Release of tumor contents, causing acute abdominal pain and potential peritonitis. Hemorrhage Internal bleeding within the tumor or peritoneal cavity leads to abdominal pain. Ovarian Torsion Twisting of the ovary compromises blood supply and causes severe pain. Pseudomyxoma Peritonei Mucinous material fills the peritoneal cavity, causing adhesions; often associated with mucinous cystadenomas. Extraperitoneal Spread Tumor growth outside the peritoneal cavity, complicates surgical removal. Malignant Change Benign tumors can transform into malignant ones, increasing the risk of metastasis.

      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "contralateral ovary and uterus fertility is unilateral salpingo-oophorectomy with staging , while preserving the contralateral ovary and the uterus. This option allows for removing the affected ovary and properly staging the disease, which is critical for diagnosing and planning further treatment if necessary. Normally for ovarian tumors, the surgery is TAH + BSO (Total Abdominal Hysterectomy with Bilateral Salpingo-Oophorectomy). Exceptions: Conservative: Unilateral salpingo-oophorectomy no hysterectomy (to preserve fertility) Germ cell tumor Sex cord tumor in young females Stage IA og epithelial tumor and family not completed Debulking surgery (Cytoreductive surgery) Advanced stages (Stage 3,4) Most patients require a combined approach, starting with maximal debulking surgery followed by chemotherapy. Surgery is typically the initial step to determine the disease stage, assess its spread, and remove as much of the disease as possible from the abdomen and pelvis. Total abdominal hysterectomy and bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy (Option A): TAH + BSO would result in the loss of fertility and is more appropriate for older patients or those who do not desire future fertility. Bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy with omentectomy and lymph node dissection (Option C): Bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy with omentectomy and lymph node dissection is a radical surgery, generally reserved for confirmed malignancy, where fertility preservation is not a concern. Laparoscopic cystectomy to remove only the cystic portion of the mass (Option D): Laparoscopic cystectomy to remove only the cystic portion of the mass would be insufficient if the mass is malignant, and it would not provide adequate staging information.

Diagnosis of Ovarian tumors Ultrasound: Ultrasound features of malignant masses: >10 cm in size Bilateral Variable consistency (solid component) Thick septa Papillary outgrowth (excrescences) from septa High vascularity in septa CT and MRI indicate the extent of the tumor spread. Fine-needle aspiration cytology (FNAC) and ascitic fluid cytology yield a high false-negative report. Tumor markers. CEA more than 5 ng/mL. (normal 2.5-5 ng/mL.) is reported in endometrioid, Brenner tumor, mucinous tumor, colonic, liver, breast and lung metastasis. CA-125 is a glycoprotein surface antigen raised in 80% of epithelial tumors, but is not very specific, as it is also raised in abdominal tuberculosis and endometriosis as well. AFP, hCG, NB/70K, placental alkaline phosphatase and lactate dehydrogenase (1000 U/L) are the tissue markers for germ cell tumors. Management of ovarian enlargement guidelines: Enlargement >8cm during pregnancy should be followed up. If functional cyst <7cm - Contraceptives and observation for 6 months. If persistent or chocolate cyst - Conservative surgery In postmenopausal women, CA 125 levels should be checked. Simple, unilocular, <8cm cysts and normal CA 125 ( <35 IU/mL)- Conservative management. Enlarged ovaries >8cm or any symptomatic ovarian tumor - Early Laparotomy. Simple ovarian cyst (Option A): Simple ovarian cysts typically do not present with such complexity or elevated CA-125. Benign serous cystadenoma (Option B): Benign serous cystadenomas generally appear as simple cystic structures and are usually unilocular (one compartment) and filled with clear fluid. They do not commonly cause elevated CA-125 levels. Ovarian endometrioma (Option D): Ovarian endometriomas are linked with endometriosis and have a different clinical presentation, typically without significant CA-125 elevation.
