      "question": "A 58-year-old woman, 5 years postmenopausal, presents with intermittent vaginal bleeding for 2 months. She reports no hormone replacement therapy use. On per-speculum examination, the cervix and vagina look atrophic. On per-vaginal examination, the uterus appears small and atrophic with no palpable adnexal mass. What is the most likely cause of postmenopausal bleeding?",
      "options": {
        "A": "Endometrial hyperplasia",
        "B": "Cervical polyps",
        "C": "Senile endometritis",
        "D": "Endometrial carcinoma"
      },
      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: C) Senile endometritis Explanation: In this scenario, given the absence of palpable masses and the slightly enlarged uterus with an atrophic-looking cervix and vagina, the likely cause of postmenopausal bleeding is Senile endometritis. Postmenopausal bleeding (PMB) is defined as vaginal bleeding that occurs 12 months or more after the cessation of menstruation. Senile endometritis refers to chronic inflammation of the endometrium due to aging. It can lead to intermittent vaginal bleeding in postmenopausal women. Common causes of postmenopausal bleeding: Senile endometritis Atrophic endometrium Endometrial hyperplasia Genital malignancy Uterine polyp Tubercular endometritis Cervical erosion and polyp Senile vaginitis Retained and forgotten foreign body (e.g., pessary or intrauterine contraceptive device) Withdrawal bleeding following estrogen intake Urethral caruncle, polyp, prolapse mucosa, or carcinoma Reference: DC Dutta’s Gynaecology Edition 8, pg 470",

      "question": "A 25-year-old woman presents with lower abdominal discomfort. Ultrasound reveals a 5 cm unilocular cystic mass adjacent to the left ovary but separate from it. The ovary itself appears normal. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?",
      "options": {
        "A": "Theca lutein cysts",
        "B": "Functional ovarian cysts",
        "C": "Paraovarian mass",
        "D": "Ovarian fibroma"
      },
      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: C) Paraovarian mass Explanation: Paraovarian masses are cystic structures in the broad ligament adjacent to but separate from the ovary. They typically appear as unilocular, thin-walled cysts on ultrasound, which matches the description in this case. Para ovarian cysts are usually non-neoplastic, originating from paramesonephric duct remnants or mesothelial inclusion cysts. They're often asymptomatic and discovered incidentally during surgery or imaging. When symptomatic, they mimic ovarian cysts. Imaging can't always differentiate them from ovarian pathology, so management often follows ovarian cyst protocols. Surgical management typically involves cystectomy or drainage and fulguration. Solid para-ovarian tumours are less common, with leiomyomas being the most frequent. Most solid tumours are asymptomatic but usually surgically removed due to difficulty differentiating benign from malignant lesions through imaging alone. Theca lutein cysts (Option A) are usually bilateral and multiple, originate from the ovary itself, and are associated with ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome or gestational trophoblastic disease. Functional ovarian cysts (Option B) originate from the ovary and typically present with a normal-appearing ovary. They are typically smaller (usually < 3 cm), except for a large corpus luteum cyst. Ovarian fibroma (Option D) is a solid tumor of the ovary, appearing as a solid mass within the ovary rather than a cystic structure, and is typically seen in older women (perimenopausal or postmenopausal).",

      "question": "A 28-year-old woman with irregular menstrual cycles, galactorrhea, and infertility has a serum prolactin level of 95 ng/mL and a 6 mm pituitary microadenoma. What is the most appropriate initial pharmacological treatment?",
      "options": {
        "A": "Levothyroxine",
        "B": "Bromocriptine",
        "C": "Metformin",
        "D": "Prednisone"
      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: B) Bromocriptine Explanation: Bromocriptine is a dopamine agonist that is commonly used as the first-line treatment for hyperprolactinemia. It works by stimulating dopamine receptors, which inhibit prolactin secretion from the pituitary gland. This can help reduce elevated prolactin levels and alleviate symptoms such as galactorrhea. It can normalize prolactin levels within days to weeks in many patients. Other dopamine agonists, such as cabergoline, may also be used, but bromocriptine is often preferred due to its long track record and effectiveness. Levothyroxine(Option A) Levothyroxine is used to treat hypothyroidism by replacing the hormone normally produced by the thyroid gland. It does not directly manage hyperprolactinemia. Metformin(Option C) Metformin is primarily used to manage type 2 diabetes by improving insulin sensitivity and lowering blood sugar levels. It is not used to treat hyperprolactinemia. Prednisone(Option D) Prednisone is a corticosteroid used to reduce inflammation and suppress the immune system. It does not affect prolactin levels and is not used to treat hyperprolactinemia.

      },
      "correct_answer": "D",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: D) >200 ng/mL Explanation: Serum prolactin levels greater than 200 ng/mL are most commonly associated with prolactin-secreting pituitary adenomas (prolactinomas) in patients with galactorrhea. Such high prolactin levels indicate macroprolactinomas (tumors larger than 10 mm). Prolactinomas typically cause significant elevations in prolactin levels, often well above the normal range. Differential diagnosis based on the levels of prolactin: Levels <20 ng/mL (Option A) are generally normal. Levels 20-40 ng/mL (Option B) can be seen in various non-tumor causes (stress, medications, hypothyroidism). Levels 40-100 ng/mL (Option C) may be seen with microprolactinomas or non-tumor causes. Levels >200 ng/mL highly suggest prolactinomas, especially macroprolactinomas. Patients with these high levels usually require medical treatment with dopamine agonists or, in some cases, surgical intervention. Reference: Williams Gynecology, 4th edition, page 360",

      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: C) Combined oral contraceptives Explanation: Combined oral contraceptives (COCs) are considered a first-line pharmacological treatment for hirsutism, especially in women with PCOS. They work by: Suppressing ovarian androgen production Increasing sex hormone-binding globulin, which reduces free testosterone Decreasing 5 α -reductase activity, limiting the conversion of testosterone to the more potent dihydrotestosterone Management of Hirsutism: Cause of Hirsutism Specific Condition Treatment Ovarian androgens Polycystic ovary syndrome Oral contraceptive pills Antiandrogens drugs Weight control Metformin Lifestyle changes Laparoscopic ovarian drilling Assisted reproductive technology Luteoma of pregnancy/theca lutein cysts Conservative management. Adrenal androgens Androgen-producing tumour Remove the tumor. Congenital adrenal hyperplasia (late onset) 21-hydroxylase deficiency Glucocorticoid replacement and suppression. Cushing syndrome Varies as to cause. Exogenous androgens Hormonal drugs Withdraw the offending drug. Hair follicle sensitivity Excessive conversion of DHT in hair follicle Spironolactone Cyproterone acetate Flutamide Depilatories Electrolysis Cosmetic treatments (waxing/shaving) Spironolactone ( Option A) Spironolactone is an androgen receptor blocker that can effectively reduce excess hair growth. However, it's typically used as a second-line treatment or in combination with other therapies. Finasteride(Option B) Finasteride is a 5-alpha reductase inhibitor that can be used to treat hirsutism, but it's not a first-line treatment for women with PCOS. It's more commonly used in men for androgenetic alopecia and benign prostatic hyperplasia. Metformin(Option D) While metformin is commonly used in the treatment of PCOS, particularly for insulin resistance and to regulate menstrual cycles, it's not a first-line treatment specifically for hirsutism.

      },
      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: C) Modified Ferriman-Gallwey Score Explanation: The Modified Ferriman-Gallwey (mFG) Score is the most widely used and accepted method for assessing hirsutism in clinical practice. This scoring system evaluates the extent of terminal hair growth in nine androgen-sensitive body areas: upper lip, chin, chest, upper back, lower back, upper abdomen, lower abdomen, upper arms, and thighs. Each area is assigned a score from 0 (no terminal hair) to 4 (extensive terminal hair growth), with the total score ranging from 0 to 36. A score of 8 or higher indicates hirsutism, although this threshold may vary depending on ethnicity and other factors. Rosenfield Scale(Option A) This scale assesses pubertal development in females, focusing on breast and pubic hair growth. It's not specific to hirsutism and is mainly used in pediatrics. Ludwigshafen Score(Option B) It is used to assess the severity of necrotizing fasciitis, not hirsutism. It evaluates factors like serum creatinine, C-reactive protein, and hemoglobin levels. Alopecia Severity Scale(Option D) It assesses hair loss, particularly in androgenetic alopecia. This scale evaluates the extent of scalp hair thinning and balding patterns, making it unsuitable for assessing hirsutism. Reference: Williams Gynecology, 4th edition, page 393",

      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: A) Hirsutism Explanation: Hirsutism is the most likely condition responsible for the presentation. It refers to excessive terminal hair growth in women in a pattern typically seen in males, such as on the upper lip, chin, chest, lower abdomen, and thighs. Hair is coarse, thick, and pigmented, resembling male-pattern hair growth. It is often caused by increased levels of androgens or increased sensitivity of hair follicles to androgens. Virilisation (Option B) Virilisation involves the development of male secondary sexual characteristics in females, including voice deepening, clitoromegaly, increased muscle mass, and changes in body fat distribution. Hypertrichosis (Option C) This condition refers to excessive hair growth that is generalized and not limited to androgen-sensitive areas. Hair may vary in texture and color but is typically not as coarse or pigmented as in hirsutism. Androgenetic alopecia (Option D) It involves gradual thinning and loss of hair over the scalp, typically due to genetic and hormonal factors affecting hair follicles.

      },
      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: A) Cervical polyps Explanation: In this clinical scenario, considering the small growth noted on her cervix and the symptom of post-coital bleeding, the most likely cause would be Cervical polyps. Cervical polyps are benign growths that can develop on the cervix and are known to cause bleeding, particularly after sexual intercourse. These polyps are typically asymptomatic but can present with bleeding or discharge when irritated or during vaginal exams. Some causes of Post-coital bleeding: Cause Description Cervical Polyps Benign growths on the cervix that can bleed, especially when irritated. Cervical Ectropion (Cervical Erosion) Exposed glandular cells on the outer surface of the cervix are prone to bleeding after intercourse. Cervical Dysplasia Abnormal changes in cervical cells that may cause bleeding during or after sex. Sexually Transmitted Infections (STIs) Infections like chlamydia, gonorrhoea, or HPV can cause cervicitis and bleeding after intercourse. Cervical prolapse(Option B) involves the descent of the cervix into the vaginal canal due to weakened pelvic floor support. While cervical prolapse can cause discomfort and sometimes spotting, it is less commonly associated with post-coital bleeding compared to cervical polyps. Cervical cancer(Option C )is a serious condition that can cause postcoital bleeding. However, it is less likely in this scenario, given the normal Pap smear result and the description of a small growth, which is more indicative of a benign condition like polyps or prolapse. Cervicitis(Option D) can cause bleeding and discharge, although polyps are more commonly associated with post-coital bleeding. Reference: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC10495171/",

      "correct_answer": "D",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: D) Endometrial biopsy. Explanation: In a postmenopausal woman presenting with postmenopausal bleeding, with an endometrial thickness of 6 mm on ultrasound, the most appropriate investigation is an endometrial biopsy. It is the most definitive method to diagnose endometrial hyperplasia, polyps, or cancer in postmenopausal women with bleeding and increased endometrial thickness. Investigation approach in Post-menopausal bleeding: History and examination to be done. Transvaginal ultrasound should be done if the cervix looks normal, which is the first step in diagnosis. A 4 mm or greater endometrial thickness in postmenopausal women is considered abnormal. It requires further evaluation since there is an increased chance of endometrial hyperplasia, and cancer rises with increasing endometrial thickness. If growth/lesion is present in the cervix, a cervical biopsy should be done to rule out cervical malignancy. Repeat pelvic ultrasound in 3 months (Option A): Delaying further investigation is not appropriate because postmenopausal bleeding requires timely evaluation to rule out malignancy or other significant pathology. An endometrial thickness of 6 mm is above the normal threshold and needs immediate investigation. CA 125 serum levels (Option B): CA 125 is a marker for ovarian cancer, not endometrial cancer. It is not specific or primary for evaluating postmenopausal bleeding. Pap smear (Option C): A Pap smear screens for cervical cancer, not endometrial issues. It does not provide information about the endometrium, the main concern in postmenopausal bleeding. Reference: Shaw’s Textbook of Gynecology, 17th Edition, Page 97",

      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: A) Cryptomenorrhea Explanation: This given clinical scenario suggests Imperforate hymen, which is associated with Cryptomenorrhea. Cryptomenorrhea: It is a condition in which menstruation occurs but is not visible due to a congenital membrane or imperforate hymen. It presents with cyclic lower abdominal pain, bluish bulge at the vaginal introitus, urinary retention, and abdominal mass. The hymen is a membranous structure at the junction of the urogenital sinus, and the sinovaginal bulb normally becomes patent during fetal development. Treatment involves surgical drainage of hematocolpos via hymenotomy, avoiding injury to the urethra and Bartholin’s glands. Several hymenotomy incision techniques include Cruciate , Graber’s radial, Caparo’s sagittal, Elliptical excision, Pozzi’s transverse, and Carbon dioxide laser. Oligomenorrhea (Option B) Infrequent bleeding occurs with >38 days between periods. This is not associated with imperforate hymen. Hypomenorrhea (Option C) Hypomenorrhea refers to abnormally light menstrual bleeding (< 5 mL of blood per day). This is not associated with imperforate hymen. Amenorrhea (Option D) While primary amenorrhea (no menstruation by age 15) could be considered, the presence of cyclic pain and a bulging hymen, in this case, points to an imperforate hymen rather than a complete absence of menstruation.",

Contraindications are active infection, pregnancy, and suspected malignancy. Myomectomy can be performed hysteroscopically, laparoscopically, or via laparotomy. In general, predominantly intracavitary myomas are resected hysteroscopically, whereas subserosa! or intramural myomas require laparotomy or laparoscopy for surgical excision. Bilateral uterine artery embolization (Option C) Uterine artery embolization is an angiographic procedure that delivers synthetic particulate emboli into both uterine arteries.

      "explanation": "Correct Answer: B) Equine estrogen injection Explanation: Inj. Equine estrogen can be used as the primary agent to control acute bleeding in abnormal uterine bleeding. Inj. Equine Estrogen: Initial Treatment: Administer 25 mg doses every 4 hours for up to three doses in acute severe AUB. Mechanism: Promotes rapid endometrial growth and enhances platelet adhesion for hemostasis. Subsequent Therapy : Discontinued after bleeding control; progestin added to stabilize endometrium. Long-term Use: Avoided due to increased risks of endometrial and breast cancer. Combined Oral Pills (Ethinyl Estradiol + Levonorgestrel) ( Option A) A regimen of a daily dose of 20-30 mcg ethinyl estradiol combined + 0.15 mg levonorgestrel for 21 days stabilizes the endometrium, reduces bleeding, and inhibits FSH and LH, thereby preventing ovulation. It is effective in limited cases but is not recommended for individuals over 35, smokers, or obese patients. This regimen is used to control abnormal uterine bleeding (AUB) but is not intended for managing acute bleeding. LNG-IUD (Levonorgestrel Intrauterine Device)(Option C) LNG-IUD (Levonorgestrel Intrauterine Device) suppresses the endometrium with minimal hormonal effects and does not impact ovarian hormones. Initial irregular bleeding is common for the first 3 months, and about 25% of users become amenorrhoeic after 1 year. Effective for up to 5 years; Quick return to fertility post-removal and 80% conceive within 12 months. Treats menorrhagia and dysmenorrhoea with uterine fibroids and adenomyosis. Medroxyprogesterone Acetate Injection ( Option D) Medroxyprogesterone acetate injection converts estradiol to weaker forms, suppresses estrogen receptors, and inhibits DNA synthesis. It causes endometrial atrophy, stabilizes the endometrium, and reduces shedding. Administered at 150 mg every three months, it is effective for managing abnormal uterine bleeding, particularly in cases unsuitable for estrogen therapy. Reference: 1.

Fibroids(Option C) Leiomyomas (L), or fibroids, are benign smooth muscle tumors of the uterus that can cause heavy menstrual bleeding and pelvic pressure. Adenomyosis(Option D) Adenomyosis (A) is the overgrowth of endometrial tissue in the myometrium, which leads to painful menstrual bleeding and a globular uterus on palpation.

      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: B) Anovulatory dysfunctional uterine bleeding (DUB) Explanation: This girl attained menarche a year ago and is now complaining of irregular menstruation and heavy menstrual bleeding. These symptoms suggest anovulatory DUB due to premature Hypothalamic-Pituitary and ovarian axis (HPO axis). Anovulatory cycles: Transition to Ovulatory Cycles: This occurs in adolescence after menarche , typically within the first few years. It also occurs in perimenopausal females. Hypothalamic-Pituitary-Ovarian Axis Maturation: This process involves positive feedback mechanisms, where rising estrogen levels trigger a surge of luteinizing hormone (LH) and subsequent ovulation. Timing: Most adolescents achieve ovulatory cycles by the end of their second year of menstruation. Cycle Length: Even during transition, cycles (including anovulatory ones) generally last 21 to 42 days. Ovulatory dysfunctional uterine bleeding (DUB)(Option A) This occurs due to increased or decreased corpus luteal function, leading to intermenstrual spotting. Polycystic Ovarian Syndrome (PCOS)(Option C) This is also associated with anovulatory cycles but is associated with other symptoms, such as obesity and hirsutism, which are not seen in this patient. Coagulation defect(Option D) This also presents with heavy menstrual bleeding. Still, they have regular cycles, and they also complain of other bleeding symptoms, such as hemarthrosis, which is not seen in this patient.

      "explanation": "Correct Answer: B) Metropathia hemorrhagica Explanation: The clinical presentation and the biopsy revealing Swiss cheese endometrium suggest Metropathia hemorrhagica, which is a specialised form of anovulatory AUB, typically affects women aged 40-45 and is characterised by continuous, painless vaginal bleeding, often following a period of amenorrhea. The uterus may be slightly enlarged. This condition can mimic abortion or ectopic pregnancy if preceded by amenorrhea but without pain. Endometrial biopsy : Hyper proliferative endometrium - Cystic Glandular Hyperplasia (CGH), also known as the Swiss cheese endometrium Endometrial cancer (Option A) It also presents with heavy menstrual bleeding and an enlarged uterus, but it does not cause anovulatory cycles, and a biopsy would show atypia.
