      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "Correct answer: A) ABO incompatibility Explanation: ABO incompatibility is not a cause of non-immune hydrops fetalis as it causes immune-type hydrops fetalis. Causes of Non-Immune Hydrops Fetalis Chromosomal abnormality (Option D ruled out) Trisomies (13, 18, 21) Turner syndrome Congenital cardiac lesions (M/C) Congenital heart block Supraventricular tachycardia Congenital abnormalities Diaphragmatic hernia Renal abnormality Cystic hygroma. Haematological Beta-thalassemia G6PD deficiency Leukaemia Alpha-thalassemia (2nd most common) (Option B ruled out) Infections Parvovirus (Option C ruled out) Rubella Toxoplasma Placental and umbilical cord pathology Twin-to-twin transfusion Chorioangioma Umbilical vein thrombosis Maternal diseases Uncontrolled diabetes Severe anaemia Thyrotoxicosis Reference: Williams Obstetrics, 26th edition, Page: 361.",

      "question": "A second gravida has Rh-negative pregnancy and her ICT titer at 28 weeks is 1:4. What is the next step in her management?",
      "options": {
        "A": "Give 300 mcg of anti-D",
        "B": "MCA Doppler",
        "C": "Repeat ICT after 4 weeks",
        "D": "No interventions are needed; deliver at term and then administer anti-D"
      },
      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Correct answer: C) Repeat ICT after 4 weeks Explanation: In the given scenario, the indirect Coomb’s test (ICT) titer is positive but less than the significant value of 1:16 so ICT is repeated every 4 weeks throughout the entire pregnancy, and once the value is found to be critical ( ≥ 1:16), the test is not repeated anymore. The steps to be followed in this and similar scenarios are given below: 300mcg of anti-D (Option A) is given when the ICT titer is negative. The given scenario has a positive ICT even though it is not critical, so she cannot be given anti-D immunoglobulin and has to be retested. MCA Doppler (Option B) is not the right step since ICT is not ≥ 1:16, which is the critical value for further evaluation with MCA and fetal USG, among other investigations. No interventions are needed; delivery at term and then administering anti-D (Option D): It is not the right step in the management of this case since the ICT is positive and hence cannot be given anti-D.

        "A": "Human immunodeficiency virus",
        "B": "Herpes simplex virus",
        "C": "Syphilis",
        "D": "Parvovirus B19"
      },
      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: A) Human immunodeficiency virus Explanation: Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) is not a known cause of nonimmune hydrops. Hydrops fetalis is diagnosed by the presence of two or more fetal effusions (e.g., pleural, pericardial, or ascites) or one effusion accompanied by anasarca. Hydrops can be classified into two types: Immune hydrops: Associated with red cell alloimmunization. Nonimmune hydrops: Occurs due to other causes unrelated to immune mechanisms. Immune Causes Rh Isoimmunization Other Blood Group Incompatibilities Non-Immune Causes Structural Defects Cardiovascular Causes: Ebstein anomaly, Tetralogy of Fallot with absent pulmonary valve, Hypoplastic left or right heart Arteriovenous Malformation Vein of Galen aneurysm Chromosomal Abnormalities Turner syndrome (45,X) Triploidy Trisomies 21, 18, and 13 Hematological Disorders Hemoglobinopathies Decreased erythrocyte production Fetomaternal hemorrhage Lymphatic Abnormalities Cystic hygroma Systemic, pulmonary lymphangiectasis Infections Parvovirus B19 (Option D) Syphilis (Option C) , Cytomegalovirus, Toxoplasmosis Rubella, Varicella, Herpes simplex (Option B) Listeriosis, Leptospirosis Chagas disease, Lyme disease Kidney and Urinary Tract Anomalies Congenital nephrosis Bladder outlet obstruction Bartter syndrome Placental, Twin, and Cord Abnormalities Twin-twin transfusion syndrome Twin anemia-polycythemia sequence Placental chorioangioma Idiopathic Causes Unknown etiology Reference: Williams Obstetrics, 26th Edition, Page: 361",

      "question": "A doctor tells a 31-year-old woman, who is 20 weeks pregnant, that her baby has a developmental defect. She has come to you for a second opinion. The following USG finding is seen. Identify the defect.",
      "options": {
        "A": "Anencephaly",
        "B": "Omphalocele",
        "C": "Cystic hygroma",
        "D": "Encephalocele"
      },
      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "Correct answer: A) Anencephaly Explanation: The given ultrasound image shows an open defect in the calvaria and skin, with exposed brain tissue, consistent with anencephaly. Anencephaly: Absence of the cranium and telencephalon above the level of the skull base and orbits. Progresses from acrania (absence of cranium with disorganized brain tissue) to exencephaly (herniation of brain tissue), with anencephaly being the final stage. It results from incomplete closure of the neural tube and can be detected as early as 10–11 weeks of gestation via ultrasound or maternal serum alpha-fetoprotein (MSAFP) screening. Sonographic findings include: Abnormal cranial contour in the first trimester. Absence of ossified cranium. Characteristic signs: Shower cap sign (disorganized brain tissue protruding). Frog eye sign (prominent orbits with absent calvaria). Anencephaly is uniformly lethal, and perinatal palliative care consultation is recommended if the pregnancy is continued. Folic acid supplementation at a dose of 4 mg daily before conception can reduce the risk of neural tube defects and is recommended in subsequent pregnancies. Omphalocele (Option B) is a congenital anterior abdominal wall defect where abdominal organs protrude through the umbilical ring, encased in a thin sac. This defect does not involve cranial structures and is unrelated to the findings of absent cranial vault and brain tissue. Cystic hygroma (Option C) is a congenital lymphatic malformation often found in the posterior neck. It appears as a multiloculated cystic mass on ultrasound and does not involve neural tissue or cranial defects, distinguishing it from the described condition. Encephalocele (Option D) is a neural tube defect characterized by herniation of brain tissue and/or meninges through a skull defect. Unlike anencephaly, encephalocele presents with a localized defect in the skull,",
