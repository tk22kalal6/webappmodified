      "question": "During the standard delivery of a primigravida with polyhydramnios, the intern prematurely removes the placenta, leading to profuse bleeding. Examination reveals an intact placenta and that the uterus is partly outside the introitus. The patient is in hemorrhagic shock, so initial resuscitative measures are taken. What is the most likely diagnosis?",
      "options": {
        "A": "Amniotic fluid embolism",
        "B": "Postpartum hemorrhage",
        "C": "Uterine inversion",
        "D": "Uterine rupture"
      },
      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: C) Uterine inversion Explanation: Pulling the cord without placental separation causes acute uterine inversion. It is defined as turning the inside out of the fundus into the uterine cavity following childbirth. Uterine inversion is a rare but grave complication during childbirth where the uterus turns partially or entirely inside out. An inverted uterus can cause serious blood loss, shock, and even death due to hemorrhagic shock Management of Uterine Inversion: Get IV/access Give rapid infusion of fluids, arrange Blood Try & Repost as soon as possible Treatment Methods for Uterine Inversion: Manual Reposition: The part that came out last should be reposited in first This is the first line of management of acute uterine inversion Hydrostatic Reposition: Also called as O'Sullivan's method , this can be tried if manual reposition fails For repositioning, first, give a Tocolytic such as Inj Terbutaline Following repositioning, Oxytocics such as Inj Oxytocin or Inj Methylergometrine are given Surgical Methods: Huntington's Method → Traumatic clamps Haultain Method → Resection of the constricting Bands Incorrect Options: Amniotic fluid embolism (Option A) : The uterus partly outside the introitus is not suggestive of Amniotic fluid embolism. Also, the placenta is intact, so amniotic fluid embolism can be ruled out. Postpartum hemorrhage (Option B) : Postpartum hemorrhage , while present in this case, is a symptom rather than the primary diagnosis. The visible uterine fundus outside the introitus indicates a specific anatomical cause for the bleeding. (Option B ruled out) Simple postpartum hemorrhage would not present with an externally visible uterus. Uterine rupture (Option D) : A uterine rupture is a complete division of all three layers of the uterus, which is not the case mentioned here.",

      "question": "What could be the possible cause for the increased bleeding in a G2P1L1 woman who had a previous cesarean section due to fetal distress and now has an uneventful vaginal birth after cesarean section (VBAC) but an incomplete removal of the placenta, with the cord snapping on traction?",
      "options": {
        "A": "Abruptio placenta",
        "B": "Placenta previa",
        "C": "Uterine rupture",
        "D": "Placenta percreta"
      },
      "correct_answer": "D",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: D) Placenta percreta Explanation: Placenta percreta is a severe form of placenta accreta in which the placenta penetrates through the entire thickness of the uterine wall and may extend beyond the uterus. This condition can cause difficulty in removing the placenta, leading to retained placental tissue and excessive bleeding. In this case, the incomplete removal of the placenta and the snapping of the umbilical cord on traction without placental expulsion are indicative of placenta percreta. The placenta is abnormally attached, making its removal challenging and contributing to the profuse bleeding observed. Placental Invasion Anomalies: Placenta Accreta, Increta, and Percreta Feature Placenta Accreta Placenta Increta Placenta Percreta Definition Superficial attachment to myometrium. Invades into the myometrium. Invades through the uterine wall to adjacent organs. Depth of Invasion Limited to myometrium surface. Partial invasion of myometrium. Complete invasion through uterine wall. Risk Factors Previous cesarean delivery, placenta previa, uterine surgery. Same as accreta. Same as accreta, higher risk with multiple cesareans. Clinical Features Postpartum hemorrhage. Severe postpartum hemorrhage. Massive hemorrhage, adjacent organ involvement. Diagnosis Ultrasound, MRI if needed. Ultrasound, MRI for depth assessment. Ultrasound, MRI showing invasion into adjacent organs. Management Planned cesarean, hysterectomy if needed. Cesarean, likely hysterectomy. Cesarean hysterectomy to prevent complications. Complications Hemorrhage. Severe hemorrhage. Massive hemorrhage, organ injury. Prognosis Good with early diagnosis. Requires surgical expertise. High morbidity and mortality risk. Abruptio placenta (Option A) refers to the premature separation of the placenta from the uterine wall, typically associated with abdominal pain and fetal distress. However, in this case, there is no mention of placental separation before delivery, making abruptio placenta unlikely as the cause of the bleeding. Placenta previa (Option B) occurs when the placenta is located near or over the cervix, often resulting in painless bleeding during pregnancy. While it can lead to bleeding during delivery, it does not typically cause incomplete removal of the placenta or the snapping of the umbilical cord during traction. Uterine rupture (Option C) is a rare but serious complication, particularly in women with a previous cesarean section. While uterine rupture can lead to severe bleeding and fetal distress, the scenario described here suggests a different cause, particularly related to placental issues, with the patient having had an uneventful VBAC.

      "question": "How should a patient be managed if a 30-year-old woman, using an intrauterine contraceptive device (IUCD) for contraception, presents to the emergency department after experiencing two episodes of painless vaginal bleeding following 8 weeks of missed periods? She also complains of dizziness, and her blood pressure is 80/50 mmHg, with a pulse rate of 138 beats per minute. A urine pregnancy test is positive.",
      "options": {
        "A": "IV fluids followed by oral methotrexate",
        "B": "Immediate laparotomy",
        "C": "Stabilizing the patient followed by suction evacuation",
        "D": "Dilatation and curettage"
      },
      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: C) Stabilizing the patient followed by suction evacuation Explanation: The clinical presentation is highly suggestive of an ectopic pregnancy, which is a medical emergency. Key features in this case include: Missed periods and positive pregnancy test indicating pregnancy. Painless vaginal bleeding and dizziness, raising suspicion of ectopic pregnancy. Hemodynamic instability (BP 80/50 mmHg, pulse 138 bpm), suggesting significant blood loss, possibly due to a ruptured ectopic pregnancy. Management Stabilize the patient: Immediate resuscitation with intravenous (IV) fluids to address hypovolemia and maintain blood pressure. Stabilization is critical to ensure the patient is safe for the next steps. Suction evacuation: This minimally invasive procedure removes the ectopic tissue and is the preferred treatment for hemodynamically stable patients. Further imaging or diagnostic laparoscopy may be used to confirm ectopic pregnancy location before intervention if the diagnosis is unclear. IV fluids followed by oral methotrexate (Option A): Methotrexate is suitable only for hemodynamically stable patients with an unruptured ectopic pregnancy and no signs of imminent rupture. This patient is unstable, requiring immediate surgical intervention, making methotrexate inappropriate. Immediate laparotomy (Option B): Laparotomy is indicated for life-threatening cases of ectopic pregnancy rupture with massive intra-abdominal bleeding or when other interventions fail. In this case, suction evacuation after stabilization is sufficient if the diagnosis is confirmed and bleeding is manageable. Dilatation and curettage (D&C) (Option D): D&C is used to manage intrauterine pregnancies or miscarriages but is not suitable for treating ectopic pregnancies, as the pregnancy is outside the uterus.

      "question": "A woman presents to the OPD with complaints of amenorrhoea for the past one year. She has a history of postpartum hemorrhage and lactational failure. What is the probable diagnosis",
      "options": {
        "A": "Sheehan’s syndrome",
        "B": "Rotor syndrome",
        "C": "Prolactinoma",
        "D": "Acromegaly"
      },
      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: A) Sheehan’s syndrome Explanation: The given scenario is characteristic of Sheehan syndrome. Sheehan's syndrome , also known as postpartum pituitary necrosis, occurs due to severe postpartum hemorrhage le ading to hypotension and inadequate blood supply to the pituitary gland. This can result in ischemic necrosis of the pituitary tissue. One of the common manifestations of Sheehan's syndrome is postpartum lactational failure, followed by amenorrhea or absence of menstrual periods. The history of postpartum hemorrhage and lactational failure in the given scenario is suggestive of Sheehan's syndrome. Incorrect Options: Rotor syndrome (Option B) is a rare inherited disorder characterized by conjugated hyperbilirubinemia (elevated direct bilirubin) without evidence of liver disease. It does not present with amenorrhea or lactational failure, making it an incorrect choice in this case. Prolactinoma (Option C) is a type of pituitary adenoma, a benign tumor of the pituitary gland that secretes excessive prolactin hormone. Hyperprolactinemia can lead to amenorrhea, as well as galactorrhea (abnormal breast milk production) and infertility. However, the given scenario does not mention symptoms related to elevated prolactin levels (e.g., galactorrhea). Hence, prolactinoma is less likely. Acromegaly (Option D) is a hormonal disorder caused by excessive production of growth hormone by a pituitary adenoma. It typically presents with gradual enlargement of hands, feet, facial features, and other tissues. While hormonal imbalances can affect menstrual cycles, acromegaly does not specifically cause amenorrhea or lactational failure, making it an unlikely diagnosis in this case.

      "question": "What is the appropriate course of action for a 24-year-old woman with a complete perineal tear after vaginal delivery?",
      "options": {
        "A": "Repair immediately",
        "B": "Repair after 3 weeks",
        "C": "Repair after 6 months",
        "D": "Repair after 3 months"
      },
      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: A) Repair immediately Explanation: \"Repair immediately\" aligns with standard medical practice for addressing a complete perineal tear. Delaying repair for several weeks or months is not recommended and may lead to more complications and poorer outcomes. Timing of Repair: A complete perineal tear should ideally be repaired as soon as possible after it is identified, which is typically within 24 hours after childbirth. Delaying the repair can increase the risk of complications, such as infection, delayed wound healing, and the development of scar tissue, which can have long-term consequences. Healing Process: Perineal tears require surgical repair to ensure proper healing of the torn tissues and to prevent complications. Immediate repair allows for the best outcomes in terms of healing and minimizing the risk of infection. Pain Management: Repairing the tear promptly also helps in managing pain and discomfort associated with the tear. Follow-up Care: After the repair, the woman will still need follow-up care to monitor her healing progress and ensure that there are no complications. A complete perineal tear, especially following childbirth, requires immediate repair to prevent complications and promote proper healing. Immediate repair reduces the risk of infection, promotes proper wound healing, and helps preserve the anatomical and functional integrity of the perineum. Delaying repair can lead to complications such as infection, impaired wound healing, and increased discomfort for the patient (Options B, C, and D ruled out) . Repairing the tear promptly, usually in an operating room or delivery suite, under sterile conditions, ensures optimal outcomes and reduces the risk of complications.",

      "question": "A patient developed atonic postpartum hemorrhage after a normal vaginal delivery. She was shifted to the OT, and the obstetrician planned ligation of vessels to arrest the bleeding. What is the order of ligation of the blood vessels supplying the uterus?",
      "options": {
        "A": "Uterine artery - Ovarian artery - Internal iliac artery",
        "B": "Uterine artery - Ovarian artery - External iliac artery",
        "C": "Uterine artery - Ovarian artery - Vaginal artery",
        "D": "Uterine artery - Pudendal artery - Vaginal artery"
      },
      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: A) Uterine artery - Ovarian artery - Internal iliac artery Explanation: In the case of atonic postpartum hemorrhage (PPH), the vessels are ligated in the following order: uterine artery → ovarian artery → internal iliac artery. The uterine artery , a branch of the internal iliac artery, is the primary vessel targeted for ligation, as it supplies most of the blood to the uterus. The ascending branch of the uterine artery is ligated between the upper and lower segments of the uterus, at the lateral border. If bleeding persists, the ovarian artery arising from the abdominal aorta may be ligated just below the ovarian ligament. Finally, if bleeding continues, the anterior division of the internal iliac artery is ligated about 5 cm distal to the common iliac bifurcation. Bilateral or unilateral ligation of the internal iliac artery reduces pulse pressure in the arteries distal to the ligation, promoting hemostasis through pressure and clot formation. Uterine artery - Ovarian artery - External iliac artery (Option B) : The external iliac artery does not directly supply the uterus and would not address uterine bleeding. Uterine artery - Ovarian artery - Vaginal artery (Option C) : The vaginal artery supplies the vagina and lower uterus but is not typically targeted for ligation in postpartum hemorrhage. Uterine artery - Pudendal artery - Vaginal artery (Option D) : The pudendal artery supplies the perineum and external genitalia, not the uterus, making it unsuitable for controlling uterine bleeding.

      },
      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: A) Acyclovir and elective Cesarean section Explanation: The diagnosis is herpes simplex virus (HSV) infection , and the management is Acyclovir and elective Cesarean section to reduce the risk of neonatal herpes transmission. HSV Infection in Pregnancy: Caused by HSV-1 or HSV-2, typically transmitted through sexual contact. Vertical transmission to the fetus is more likely to be caused by primary infections. Transmission Risk: Highest during labor, but can also occur in utero or postnatally. Diagnosis: Confirm with PCR or culture of lesions. Treatment: Acyclovir (oral or IV) for both primary and recurrent infections. IV acyclovir for severe infections. Pain management: Analgesics or topical anesthetics. Delivery Recommendations: Elective cesarean section is advised if active genital lesions or prodromal symptoms (itching/burning) are present to minimize the risk of transmission to the baby. Acyclovir and induction of labor (Option B): Inducing labor in the presence of active genital herpes is not recommended, as it increases the risk of neonatal herpes transmission. Spontaneous delivery (Option C) is not recommended due to the risk of transmitting active genital herpes to the newborn. Antiviral and normal vaginal delivery (Option D): Even after antiviral therapy, normal vaginal delivery is contraindicated with active genital herpes lesions due to the risk of neonatal herpes transmission.

        "D": "Delayed blood transfusion reaction"
      },
      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: A) Sheehan syndrome Explanation: The patient's history of fatigue, constipation, lactational failure, postpartum amenorrhea, and multiple blood transfusions points to Sheehan syndrome, which is caused by pituitary infarction following severe postpartum hemorrhage. Sheehan Syndrome: Definition Postpartum hypopituitarism caused by ischemic necrosis of the pituitary gland following severe postpartum hemorrhage. Symptoms Failure to lactate Hypotension Hypoglycemia Fatigue Amenorrhea Hypothyroidism Adrenal insufficiency Decreased libido Weight gain Cold intolerance Diagnosis Clinical history of severe postpartum hemorrhage. Hormonal evaluation: Low levels of pituitary hormones (prolactin, TSH, ACTH, LH, FSH, growth hormone). MRI: Empty sella or reduced pituitary size. Treatment: Lifelong hormone replacement therapy (glucocorticoids, levothyroxine, estrogen-progesterone, growth hormone if needed) Sheehan’s Syndrome should be differentiated from other conditions causing hypopituitarism, such as pituitary apoplexy, hypothyroidism, Addison’s disease, empty sella syndrome, hypogonadotropic hypogonadism, hypoprolactinemia. Hypothyroidism (Option B): While hypothyroidism can cause fatigue and constipation, it does not typically cause lactational failure, and the history of multiple blood transfusions after delivery makes Sheehan syndrome a more likely diagnosis in this case. Premature ovarian failure (Option C): While premature ovarian failure causes amenorrhea and hormonal imbalances, it does not explain the lactational failure or the history of significant blood loss after delivery, which points more towards Sheehan syndrome. Delayed blood transfusion reaction (Option D) is unlikely in this case, as it typically presents with immediate symptoms related to the transfusion and does not account for the prolonged symptoms, such as lactational failure and amenorrhea, described by the patient.

      "explanation": "Correct Answer: D) 100 mcg Explanation: The correct dosage of carbetocin for the prevention of postpartum hemorrhage is 100 mcg. Carbetocin is a synthetic analogue of oxytocin, used in obstetrics to reduce the risk of postpartum hemorrhage due to its long-lasting effects. Drugs used in PPH: Drug/Treatment Dosage/Administration Key Notes Oxytocin (IV) 10-20 units in drip Drug of choice for uterine atony Never give undiluted bolus dose (causes hypotension and arrhythmias) Oxytocin overdose causes water intoxication Carbetocin 100 mcg in 1 ml IV over 1 min Synthetic analogue of oxytocin, more sustained release Onset: 2 mins, lasts 1 hour (compared to oxytocin's onset of 5 mins and lasts 20 mins) Equivalent to 16 hrs of oxytocin drip Methylergometrine 0.2 mg IV (also IM, IV acts faster) Peak action in 90 seconds Can be given IM, but IV acts faster Misoprostol (PGE1) 1000 µ g per rectum or 200-400 µ g sublingually Prostaglandin used for postpartum hemorrhage Effective for uterine contraction Carboprost (PGF α ) 250 µ g IM only Never given IV (causes sudden hypertension) Can be administered intra-myometrial Used when other drugs are ineffective Tranexamic Acid 1 gm IV Anti-fibrinolytic agent Helps prevent bleeding by inhibiting fibrinolysis Fibrinogen Maintain >100 mg/dl For maintaining fibrinogen levels Can be administered as 10 units of cryoprecipitate or 1 litre of fresh frozen plasma (FFP) Reference: Williams Obstetrics 26th Edition, Page 736 https://www.uptodate.com/contents/misoprostol-drug-inform ation?search=misoprostol&source=panel_search_result&selectedTitle=1~113&usage_type=panel&kp_tab=drug_ general&display_rank=1 https://www.uptodate.com/contents/postpartum-hemorrhage-medical-and-minimally-invas ive-management?search=postpartum%20hemorrhage%20management&source=search_result&selectedTitle=2~15 0&usage_type=default&display_rank=2#H187794904",

        "D": "Preterm labor"
      },
      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: A) Abruptio placenta Explanation: Placental abruption ( abruptio placentae ) is an unusual yet serious complication of pregnancy. The placenta develops in the uterus during pregnancy. It attaches to the wall of the uterus and supplies the baby with nutrients and oxygen. Placental abruption occurs when the placenta partly or completely separates from the inner wall of the uterus before delivery . This can decrease or block the baby's supply of oxygen and nutrients and cause heavy bleeding in the mother. Placental abruption often happens abruptly. Left untreated, it endangers both the mother and the baby. Placenta previa (Option B): While this condition also presents with vaginal bleeding, it is typically painless and not associated with hypertension. The bleeding in placenta previa is bright red and occurs without abdominal pain or uterine tenderness. Hydramnios (Option C): Excess amniotic fluid condition that presents with increased uterine size and maternal discomfort but does not cause acute bleeding or pain. It is not typically associated with hypertension or decreased fetal movements. Preterm labor (Option D): While this can occur with placental abruption, it does not present with vaginal bleeding, hypertension and reduced fetal movements. Preterm labor typically presents with regular uterine contractions and cervical changes Reference: Williams Obstetrics, 25th Edition, Pages 755-760",

      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: B) Placental abruption Explanation: Placental abruption, a serious obstetric emergency where the placenta separates from the uterine wall before delivery, can lead to DIC due to the release of tissue factor into the maternal circulation. This triggers the coagulation cascade , leading to widespread clotting and consumption of clotting factors. Key Causes of Consumptive Coagulopathy: Cause Description Disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) DIC is a condition characterized by widespread activation of blood clotting mechanisms, leading to the formation of small clots throughout the body Preeclampsia Preeclampsia is a hypertensive disorder that can lead to organ damage, including liver dysfunction, which may trigger consumptive coagulopathy HELLP syndrome HELLP syndrome is a severe form of preeclampsia characterized by Hemolysis, Elevated Liver enzymes, and Low Platelet count Acute fatty liver of pregnancy This rare condition affects liver function and may result in a consumptive coagulopathy due to liver dysfunction Septic abortion Septic abortion refers to an infection of the products of conception, which can cause inflammation and abnormal clotting Placenta percreta/increta/accreta These conditions involve abnormal adherence of the placenta to the uterine wall, which can lead to significant bleeding and coagulation abnormalities Incorrect Options: Intrauterine death (Option A) : Intrauterine fetal demise (IUFD) can lead to DIC in the mother. When the fetus dies in utero, products of fetal tissue breakdown enter the maternal circulation, activating the coagulation cascade. While IUFD can cause DIC, it is not the predominant factor. Sepsis (Option C) : Sepsis, especially severe cases, can lead to DIC in obstetric patients. While sepsis is a potential cause of consumptive coagulopathy, it is not the predominant cause. Amniotic fluid embolism (Option D) : AFE is a serious obstetric emergency that occurs when amniotic fluid enters the maternal bloodstream, triggering an immune response and leading to a systemic inflammatory reaction, coagulopathy, and cardiovascular collapse. However, it is an uncommon cause in obstetrical patients. Reference: Williams Textbook of Obstetrics, 26th Edition, Page 775-776",

        "D": "Risk of bladder injury"
      },
      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "Correct answer: A) Risk of bowel injury Explanation: In cases of PAS, the primary concern is the abnormal attachment of the placenta to the uterine wall, and the risk of invasion into adjacent structures, such as the bladder and sometimes bowel. While bladder involvement is relatively common, direct bowel injury is less frequently emphasized in counselling. The primary risks usually revolve around bleeding, the potential need for a hysterectomy, and the possibility of bladder injury. Management of placenta accreta spectrum Placenta Accreta Type Management Partial Placenta Accreta Remove as much placenta as possible Use oxytocics to control bleeding Total Placenta Accreta Complete family: Perform hysterectomy Incomplete family: Leave the placenta for autolysis within the uterus and administer antibiotics Consider uterine artery embolisation or Methotrexate therapy Placenta Percreta with Bladder Invasion Perform hysterectomy with partial cystectomy. Possible complications of PAS surgery: Blood loss and need for immediate blood transfusion Placental ingrowth to the bladder causes bleeding on attempting manual removal Postoperative venous thromboembolism The need for blood transfusion (Option B) is due to significant bleeding, which is a substantial risk in cases of PAS due to abnormal placental attachment. The risk of requiring a hysterectomy (Option C) is a crucial aspect to discuss in counselling, as PAS cases often involve difficulty separating the placenta from the uterine wall, leading to potential complications that may necessitate a hysterectomy. The risk of bladder injury (Option D) is a significant consideration in PAS cases. Abnormal placental attachment can lead to invasion into the bladder wall, increasing the risk of injury during attempts to separate the placenta from the uterine wall.

      "explanation": "Correct Answer: C) Uterine rupture Explanation: The clinical manifestations indicate uterine rupture , a life-threatening obstetric emergency characterized by complete separation of the uterine wall with potential extrusion of fetal parts into the maternal abdomen. The presence of previous cesarean section is the most significant risk factor, along with the characteristic presentation of sudden onset severe abdominal pain with hemodynamic instability. The clinical diagnosis is supported by palpable fetal parts through the maternal abdomen, abnormal fetal heart rate patterns or weak/absent fetal heart sounds, and signs of maternal shock including tachycardia and hypotension. Pathophysiology: Uterine rupture is a full separation of the uterus's three layers Most commonly occurs when the uterus is gravid in the setting of a trial of labor after cesarean delivery Incorrect Options: Amniotic fluid embolization (Option A) : Characteristic symptoms include bleeding from the uterus, C-section incision, or IV (intravenous) sites, shortness of breath or difficult breathing, sudden drop in blood pressure - which are not reported in this case. Placental abruption (Option B) : Characterized by vaginal bleeding, which is not present in this case. Local anesthesia anaphylaxis (Option D) : Anaphylaxis symptoms typically emerge within minutes of being exposed to an allergen. The case does not indicate the use of local anesthesia.

      "explanation": "Correct Answer: D) Laparoscopic cerclage Explanation: Laparoscopic abdominal cerclage is performed in a nonpregnant woman, particularly before conception. It provides support at the internal os of the cervix and is used for women with recurrent cervical complications, failed vaginal cerclage, or a cervix too short for vaginal cerclage. Advantages: Higher placement relative to the internal os. No risk of suture slippage. No foreign body material in the vagina. Lash and Lash cerclage (Option A) is a traditional method of transvaginal cervical cerclage, which is no longer recommended and is not used in nonpregnant women. Benson and Durfee cerclage (Option B) is a transabdominal cerclage performed via laparotomy, typically used in pregnant women when the vaginal approach is not feasible. Wurm’s cerclage (Option C) involves placing circumferential sutures transvaginally using monofilament sutures, but it is performed during pregnancy.

      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: C) Both succenturiate lobe and velamentous insertion of the cord Explanation: The abnormal placenta shown in the image depicts both a succenturiate lobe and velamentous insertion of the cord. The image depicts features of both abnormalities: The presence of an accessory lobe confirms a succenturiate lobe. The insertion of the umbilical cord into membranes rather than directly into the placenta confirms velamentous insertion. Coexistence of these abnormalities increases the risk of obstetric complications such as: Fetal bleeding in cases of vessel rupture. Retained tissue after delivery leading to postpartum complications. Succenturiate Lobe: A succenturiate lobe is an accessory lobe of the placenta that is separate from the main placental body but connected by blood vessels. Clinical Relevance: Can lead to complications such as retained placental tissue after delivery, increasing the risk of postpartum hemorrhage. If unrecognized, it might result in infection or delayed uterine involution. It may also interfere with the normal course of delivery if the lobe remains in the uterus. Velamentous Insertion of the Cord: Velamentous insertion occurs when the umbilical cord inserts into the fetal membranes (chorioamniotic membranes) instead of the placental disk. The blood vessels then traverse unprotected (unsupported by Wharton's jelly) before reaching the placenta. Clinical Relevance: Increases the risk of vasa previa, a condition where fetal blood vessels pass near or over the cervical os, leading to high risk of vessel rupture during labor. May result in compromised blood flow to the fetus, potentially causing growth restriction or",

      },
      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: A) Start colloid initially, 4 times the blood lost Explanation: The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends using intravenous crystalloids (like normal saline or Ringer's lactate) rather than colloids for fluid resuscitation in the management of postpartum hemorrhage (PPH). Postpartum Hemorrhage (PPH) Vaginal Delivery: Blood loss > 500 mL. (Option C ruled out) Cesarean Section: Blood loss > 1000 mL. Types of PPH: Primary PPH: Within 24 hours of delivery (Option B ruled out) Most common cause: Atonic PPH Secondary PPH: After 24 hours of delivery to 12 weeks Most common cause: Retained bits of placenta (Option D ruled out) Causes of Primary PPH Cause Description Factors increasing risk Uterine Atony (Most common) The inability of the uterus to contract effectively after delivery leads to a soft and boggy uterus and continuous bleeding from the placental site. Grand multiparity Overdistension of the uterus: Multiple pregnancies, hydramnios, large baby Malnutrition, and anemia Antepartum hemorrhage: Placenta previa and placental abruption Prolonged labour Anesthesia Oxytocin use. Uterine malformations Other factors: Obesity, h/o PPH, advanced maternal age (over 40 years), tocolytics and magnesium sulfate Retained Tissue Prevents proper uterine contraction, causing primary PPH with continued bleeding and incomplete contraction. Although more commonly associated with secondary PPH, retained placental fragments can also be a cause of primary PPH. Trauma to the genital tract Cervical, vaginal, or perineal tears are a significant cause of primary PPH. This type of bleeding occurs despite a well-contracted uterus. Assisted deliveries Rapid labor Large babies Thrombin (Coagulopathy) Involves disorders of blood clotting, which are a less common cause of PPH. They can be acquired or congenital. Placental abruption Jaundice in pregnancy Thrombocytopenic purpura Severe pre-eclampsia HELLP syndrome Intrauterine device (IUD) Management: Initial Fluid Resuscitation : Start with crystalloids (up to 2 liters) for fluid resuscitation, with blood transfusion if needed. Crystalloids like normal saline or Ringer's lactate are the first choice for fluid resuscitation in PPH. Blood Transfusion may be needed depending on the severity of blood loss. Colloids may be considered if there is a need for packed RBC transfusion once blood is available. Reference: https://obgyn.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/1471-0528.14178",

      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: A) Warning bleeds Explanation: Placenta previa is a condition where the placenta is implanted in the lower uterine segment, either over or close to the internal cervical os. Clinical Features: Warning bleeds: The hallmark of placenta previa is recurrent, painless vaginal bleeding that occurs after the second trimester, often referred to as \"warning hemorrhage\". The bleeding is usually mild and not immediately fatal. This is called a sentinel bleed. Uterus characteristics: Typically relaxed, soft, and non-tender, unlike the tense, tender uterus seen in placental abruption. Fetal heart sound: Usually present unless there is significant separation of the placenta. Management Considerations: Per-vaginal examination should be avoided in suspected cases of placenta previa due to the risk of provoking further bleeding. Examination can only be safely performed in the operating theatre, where a cesarean section can be immediately performed if needed. Risk Factors for Placenta Previa: Multigravida (more than one pregnancy) Advanced maternal age (>35 years) Previous cesarean section or myomectomy Abnormal placental size and lobes Prior curettage Types of placenta previa: placenta previa\" data-author=\"\" data-hash=\"11010\" data-license=\"\" data-source=\"\" data-tags=\"April2025\" src=\"https://image.prepladder.com/notes/lFzE0hOTAaZX5MDnmcVy1745333115.jpg\" /> Types Definitions I Low lying The placenta is implanted in the lower uterine segment but does not reach the internal os. II Marginal The edge of the placenta is at the margin of the internal os. III Incomplete/partial central The placenta partially covers the internal os of the cervix. IV Central/complete The placenta completely covers the internal os of the cervix. Types I and II can be anterior or posterior. Types I and II are minor degrees, and types III and IV are major degrees of placenta previa. Revised Classification: Types Definitions True Placenta previa The placenta covers the internal os Low lying placenta The placenta lies within 2cm of internal is but does not cover it Dark painful bleeding (Option B), uterine tenderness (Option C), and increased/large uterine size (Option D) are seen in placental abruption, not placenta previa.

      "correct_answer": "D",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: D) Carboprost Explanation: The prostaglandin derivative effective for refractory postpartum hemorrhage after oxytocin and ergometrine is Carboprost. Uterotonic Agents for Postpartum Hemorrhage (PPH) Management: First-Line Agent: Oxytocin: WHO recommends first-line prophylaxis. Dosage: 20 units in 1000 mL crystalloid IV at 10 mL/min (200 mU/min). IM administration is an alternative if IV access is unavailable. Used for continued or initiation of uterine atony. Contraindications: Avoid undiluted bolus IV due to risks of hypotension or cardiac arrhythmias. Second-Line Agents: Ergot Alkaloids: Examples: Ergonovine, Methylergonovine (Methergine). Usage: Rapid tetanic uterine contractions (last ~45 minutes). Dosage: 0.2 mg IM, repeatable every 2-4 hours. Contraindications: Hypertension, preeclampsia, or concomitant HIV protease inhibitors. Prostaglandins: Carboprost Tromethamine (Hemabate): Dosage: 250 µg IM, repeatable at 15-90 min intervals (max 8 doses). Side Effects: Diarrhea, hypertension, vomiting, fever, flushing, tachycardia, pulmonary constriction. Contraindications: Asthma, pulmonary hypertension, renal/liver/cardiac disease, suspected amniotic fluid embolism. Misoprostol: Synthetic prostaglandin E1 analogue. Dosage: 600-1000 µg rectally, orally, or sublingually. No added effect compared to oxytocin or ergometrine for treatment of uterine atony. (Option B) Dinoprostone (Prostaglandin E2): Off-label use: 20 mg rectally/vaginally every 2 hours. Side Effects: Diarrhea, hypotension. Due to hypotension, it is contraindicated in some cases and not used for hemorrhage management in certain centers. (Option A) Latanoprost (Option C) : A prostaglandin F2 α analogue, designed for ophthalmic use to lower intraocular pressure in glaucoma. It has no role in managing postpartum hemorrhage.

        "C": "Polyhydraminos",
        "D": "Preterm labor"
      },
      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: A) Abruptio placenta Explanation: The clinical scenario with severe abdominal pain, vaginal bleeding, loss of fetal movements, and uterine tenderness points towards diagnosis of Abruptio placenta. Abruptio Placenta: Refers to the early partial/total separation of the placenta from the uterine lining before the completion of the second stage of labor. Risk Factors: Health History: Smoking, cocaine use during pregnancy, maternal age >35 years, hypertension, and a history of placental abruption in prior pregnancies. Current Pregnancy: Multiple gestations, polyhydramnios, preeclampsia, sudden uterine decompression, and short umbilical cord. Trauma: Abdominal trauma from a motor vehicle collision, fall, or violence can lead to placental abruption. Classification of Placental Abruption: Class 0 (Asymptomatic): Discovery of a blood clot on the maternal side of a delivered placenta, diagnosed retrospectively. Class 1 (Mild): No or small vaginal bleeding, slight uterine tenderness, normal maternal vital signs, and no fetal distress. Class 2 (Moderate): Moderate vaginal bleeding , significant uterine tenderness , changes in vital signs (tachycardia, orthostatic hypotension), evidence of fetal distress , and clotting abnormalities. Class 3 (Severe): Heavy vaginal bleeding, tetanic uterus, maternal shock, coagulopathy, and fetal death. Placenta previa (Option B) occurs when the placenta is positioned in the lower uterine segment, covering part or all of the cervical os, leading to painless vaginal bleeding, but it does not usually cause severe abdominal pain, uterine tenderness, or loss of fetal movements as seen in this scenario. Polyhydramnios (Option C) is characterized by excessive amniotic fluid, typically does not cause severe abdominal pain or vaginal bleeding. It may lead to discomfort or premature labor, but these are not the primary symptoms in this case. Preterm labor (Option D) involves contractions and cervical changes, but it usually does not result in significant bleeding, abdominal pain, uterine tenderness, or loss of fetal movements, which are key features in this scenario.

      "correct_answer": "D",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: D) Cesarean section In the given scenario, the prolonged labor curve is beyond the established alert line on the partogram, indicating a lack of progress in labor due to cephalo-pelvic disproportion. This is a concerning finding and suggests the need for intervention as an emergency Cesarean section. The above partogram also shows the following: The cervix is fully dilated Moulding is 2+ The station is 3+, and oxytocin infusion is already given The uterine contractions are adequate The amniotic fluid is stained with meconium, and there is a fall in fetal heart rate indicating fetal distress. All these point to CPD and indicate an emergency C-section Forceps-assisted delivery (Option A) is typically decided based on various factors, such as fetal distress or maternal exhaustion, and would require a specific indication beyond the information provided in the question. Vacuum-assisted delivery (Option B) involves using a vacuum extractor to assist in the delivery of the baby. Similar to forceps-assisted delivery, the given information does not provide any specific indications for vacuum-assisted delivery. Oxytocin infusion (Option C) is already mentioned in the scenario, indicating that it has already been given. Oxytocin is commonly used to induce or augment labour by stimulating uterine contractions. However, if the labor is not progressing despite the oxytocin infusion, it would not be appropriate to continue with oxytocin as the sole management option.",

        "D": "Observation"
      },
      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "Correct answer: A) Antihypertensives + ARM (artificial rupture of membranes) Explanation: The diagnosis here is of abruptio placenta. Since the patient is already in labour in the given scenario, the ideal step is ARM along with antihypertensives, as her BP is 150/100 mmHg (NICE criteria). Vaginal delivery is favoured in: Limited placental abruption. FHR tracing is reassuring. Facilities for continuous fetal monitoring are available. The prospect of vaginal delivery is soon. Placental abruption with a dead fetus. Cesarean section is favoured in: (Option B) Bleeding continues, and the placental abruption is greater than in Grade 1. Severe abruption with a live fetus. An amniotomy could not be done due to an unfavourable cervix. The prospect of immediate vaginal delivery is remote despite attempts. Amniotomy failed to control bleeding. Amniotomy failed to arrest the process of abruption, evidenced by rising fundal height or the appearance of adverse features (e.g., fetal distress, falling fibrinogen level, oliguria). Tocolytics (Option C) , which are medications to inhibit uterine contractions for expectant management of the pregnancy (<35 weeks), are not typically used in this scenario where fetal demise is suspected and the labour is to be initiated. Observation (Option D) is not the treatment modality suitable here as the woman has evidence of fetal demise and is only at 30 weeks of gestation. Hence, there is no point in expectant management of the pregnancy.",
