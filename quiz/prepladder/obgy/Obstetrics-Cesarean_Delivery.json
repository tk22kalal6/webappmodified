      "correct_answer": "D",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: D) Gestational diabetes Explanation: Gestational diabetes that is well-controlled with diet and exercise alone is not an indication for a C-section. Women with GDM can often have a vaginal delivery if there are no other complications. If controlled, there is no significant risk to the mother or fetus. If macrosomia is suspected, then repeat cesarean can be offered.

      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: B) Doyen’s retractor Explanation: Doyen’s Retractor: Long metallic instrument with a stout handle at one end. Wide retracting blade at the other end (fan-shaped and curved). Requires an assistant for holding and retraction. Uses: Retracts the abdominal wall and bladder for proper exposure of the lower uterine segment during lower segment cesarean section (LSCS). Introduced after opening the abdomen. Temporarily removed during baby delivery. Reintroduced after delivery and finally removed after toileting the peritoneal cavity. Langenbeck’s retractor (Option A) is a superficial retractor with a long handle and a small solid blade. It can be single- or double-bladed and is used in hernia or superficial surgeries to retract skin, fascia, and aponeurosis. Morris retractor (Option C) is a manual retractor with a flat, curved blade and a beak end. It can be single or double-bladed and is used to retract deep abdominal, loin, subcostal, or other wounds. Deaver’s retractor (Option D) is shaped like a question mark with a broad, curved, long blade and strong handle. It is used to retract the abdominal wall and viscera in major surgeries like vagotomy, cholecystectomy, and gastrectomy.",

        "C": "Grossly infected uterus.",
        "D": "History of multiple cesarean deliveries."
      },
      "correct_answer": "D",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: D) History of multiple cesarean deliveries. Explanation: While a history of multiple cesarean sections can increase the risk of complications such as placenta accreta spectrum in subsequent pregnancies, it is not an immediate indication for performing a cesarean hysterectomy on its own. The actual indication would be based on complications that arise during the current delivery, such as severe bleeding, not just the history of prior cesareans. Cesarean Hysterectomy: Definition Cesarean hysterectomy is a surgical procedure performed to remove the uterus during or after a Cesarean delivery Types Total : Entire uterus including cervix removed. Supracervical/Subtotal : Upper uterus removed, cervix intact. Indications Morbidly adherent placenta (Option B) Atonic uterus and uncontrolled postpartum hemorrhage (Option A) Large uterine leiomyoma (parous women) Extensive lacerations with broad ligament hematoma Grossly infected uterus (Option C) Ruptured uterus Postpartum atony Cervical cancer Complications Postoperative hemorrhage Bladder laceration Bowel injury Wound dehiscence Ureteral injury Fistula: Vesicovaginal Ureterovaginal Rectovaginal Thromboembolism Infection Reference: 1.

        "D": "Absent uterine contractions."
      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: B) Heavy vaginal bleeding. Explanation: Rupture of Uterus: Is defined as the disruption in the continuity of all three layers of the uterus: endometrium (inner epithelial layer), myometrium (smooth muscle layer) and perimetrium (serosal outer layer). Implies involvement of gravid uterus. Signs and symptoms of Uterine Rupture: Hemodynamic Instability in mother: Hypotension, tachycardia, dizziness, nausea, and anxiety. Pain: Sudden ripping abdominal pain. (Option A) Blood in the peritoneum causes referred pain to the chest or shoulder. Bladder Injury: Hematuria (pink, red, or brown urine), potential blood clots may pass through the urethra (can be painful). Fetal Heart Rate: Fetal bradycardia, reduced variability, late decelerations, or absent heart sounds. (Option C) Abdominal Examination: Midline abdominal tenderness. Decreased or absent uterine contractions. (Option D) Vaginal Examination: Minimal vaginal bleeding unless the rupture extends into the vagina or cervix. (Option B) Loss of fetal station occurs if part of the fetus enters the peritoneum. Type of Rupture Incomplete Rupture Complete Rupture Cause Rupture of lower segment scar. Extension of cervical tear into the lower segment with the formation of a broad ligament hematoma. Disruption of upper segment scar. Spontaneous rupture (obstructive or non-obstructive). Peritoneum Remains intact. Disrupted, peritoneal cavity is involved. Fetal/Placental Position Both fetus and placenta remain inside the uterine cavity, or part of the fetus may be between broad ligament layers. Fetus with or without a placenta usually escapes out of the uterus. Reference: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK559209/ DC Dutta’s Textbook of Obstetrics, 9th Edition, Page: 400- 403",

      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: C) Android pelvis is better than flat pelvis. Explanation: Trial Labor: Definition Conduction of spontaneous labor in a minor to moderate degree of cephalopelvic disproportion in an institution under supervision aiming for vaginal delivery. Aims Avoid unnecessary cesarean sections and at delivering a healthy baby. Contraindications Midpelvic and outlet contraction. Complicating factors: Elderly primigravida, Malpresentation, Postmaturity, Pre-eclampsia, Medical disorders like diabetes, heart disease etc. Lack of 24/7 cesarean facilities. Successful Outcome Factors Degree of pelvic contraction. (Option A) Pelvic shape (flat is better than android). (Option C) Favorable vertex presentation. Intact membranes until full dilation. (Option B) Effective uterine contractions. (Option D) Emotional support to the woman. Unfavorable Features Abnormal uterine contractions. Cervical dilation < 1 cm/hour in active phase. Fetal head descent < 1 cm/hour in spite of regular uterine contractions. Arrest of cervical dilation despite oxytocin therapy. Early rupture of membranes. Caput formation and excessive molding. Fetal distress. Duration of Trial Individualized; continue if progress is satisfactory. Terminate if there is arrest of progress of labor for 3-4 hours or if ominous features arise. Termination Methods Any one of the following: Spontaneous delivery with or without episiotomy (30%). Forceps or ventouse (30%). Cesarean section (40%). Successful Trial Vaginal delivery of a healthy baby with mother in good condition. Failure of Trial Cesarean section or delivery of a dead baby. Advantages Avoids unnecessary cesarean section. Reduces preterm induction risks. Ensures better future obstetric outcomes. Disadvantages Tests of disproportion remain unproven if cesarean needed due to fetal distress or uterine dysfunction. Increased perinatal morbidity/ mortality from prolonged/ difficult delivery. Increased maternal morbidity from prolonged labor or operative delivery. Psychological morbidity when trial ends with traumatic vaginal delivery or in cesarean delivery. Reference: DC Dutta’s Textbook of Obstetrics, 9th Edition, Page no: 332,333",

Explanation: Vaginal birth after cesarean section (VBAC) Described as vaginal delivery in a woman who has given birth via cesarean section in a former pregnancy. Patients desiring VBAC delivery undergo a trial of labor (TOL), also called the trial of labor after cesarean section (TOLAC). Selection Criteria of Cases for TOLAC (ACOG) One (RCOG) or two (ACOG) previous lower segment transverse scar. Nonrecurring indication for prior cesarean section. Pelvis adequate for the fetus. Continued labor monitoring possible. Availability of resources (anesthesia, blood transfusion and theatre) for an emergency cesarean section within 30 minutes of the decision. Informed consent of the woman. Contraindications for TOLAC (indications for Cesarean Delivery) Previous classical or inverted T-shaped uterine incision , myomectomy scar Previously >2 LSCS Pelvis contracted or suspected CPD. Presence of other complications in pregnancy: Obstetric (pre-eclampsia, malpresentation, placenta previa) or medical. Resources limited for emergency cesarean delivery or patient refusal for TOLAC. History of prior uterine rupture Benefits of TOLAC Complications of Unsuccessful TOLAC Decreased maternal morbidity (infection and others). Reduced length of hospital stay. (Option D) Decreased need for blood transfusion. Decreased risk of abnormal placentation (Option A) and need for successive cesarean delivery in next pregnancy. (Option B) Maternal Uterine wound dehiscence. (Option C) Uterine rupture (0.5-1%). Increased blood transfusion. Increased risks of hysterectomy due to uterine rupture. Infections increased maternal morbidity. Perinatal: Low Apgar score, admission to NICU, hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy (HIE), neonatal death, rarely stillbirth. Reference: 1.

Steps in C-section 1. Skin Incision: Pfannenstiel Incision: Incised with a low, transverse, curvilinear incision at the pubic hairline, extending laterally (12-15cm). Joel-cohen incision: Straight, transverse incision 3 cm below the anterior superior iliac spines. 2. Dissection: Subcutaneous Layer: Sharp dissection; use cautery to minimize bleeding. Fascia: Incise midline and extend laterally. Muscle: Rectus abdominis and pyramidalis muscles are separated in the midline to expose transversalis fascia and peritoneum. 3. Access to Abdominal Cavity: Sharp or blunt incision over the peritoneum. 4. Uterine Incision: Low transverse (preferred) or vertical incision. (Option A) 5. Fetal Delivery: Delivered by gently elevating the head with hands. Cord Clamping: Doubly clamp and cut; delayed clamping can be beneficial in some cases. 6. Placenta Delivery: Achieved by spontaneous delivery by gentle traction and fundal massage. Manual removal is an alternative if necessary. 7. Uterine Repair: Uterine incision is closed with continuous sutures, typically one layer, for efficiency. 8. Abdominal Closure: Abdominal cavity is cleaned, and the rectus fascia is closed. Subcutaneous tissue is closed if thick. 9. Skin Closure: With subcuticular sutures, staples or adhesive glue. Merits and Demerits of Lower segment transverse and Lower segment vertical incisions: Parameters Lower segment transverse Lower segment vertical Extension of incision May occur to involve the uterine vessels May occur to involve the upper segment or downward the bladder Bladder dissection Minimal More when extends inferiorly Uterine closure Easy Difficult Muscle apposition Good Often imperfect Reperitonization Complete Often imperfect Intraoperative bleeding Less More Subsequent adhesions Less More Risk of scar rupture 0.5%-1% 0.8%-2% Vertical incisions (Option B) results in more blood loss, require more bladder dissection and have a higher risk of uterine rupture in future pregnancies compared to transverse incisions. Classical incisions (Option C) are harder to repair, result in more bleeding, and have a higher risk of adhesion formation and uterine rupture in future pregnancies compared to low transverse incisions. High transverse incisions (Option D) are linked to increased wound morbidity and infection compared to low transverse incisions",

      },
      "correct_answer": "D",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: D) Reduce risk of respiratory issues in the newborn Explanation: The cesarean section increases the risk of respiratory distress syndrome (RDS) because it bypasses the natural labor process, which helps in absorbing fetal lung fluid and also helps in the maturity of the surfactant in the lungs. As a result, babies born via cesarean are more likely to experience respiratory distress syndrome (RDS). Maternal Benefits Fetal Benefits Reduced risk of urinary incontinence (Option A) Reduce the risk of fecal incontinence Reduce the risk of pelvic organ prolapse Avoidance of labor pain Alleviation of fear and anxiety related to labor or birth Convenience and control over birth timing (Option C) Reduced worry about the health of the baby Reduce risk of perinatal morbidity and mortality Reduce the risk of unexplained or unexpected stillbirth Reduce risk of complications like chorioamnionitis, skin laceration, fetal heart rate abnormalities, cord prolapse, cephalhematoma, skull and clavicle fracture, brachial plexopathy and facial nerve injury (Option B) Reference: 1.

      "correct_answer": "D",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: D) Maternal preference for scheduled delivery Explanation: A cesarean should only be performed when there is a medical indication related to the fetus or mother's health. Maternal preference alone, without a medical reason, is not sufficient justification for performing a cesarean section. Maternal-fetal and Fetal Indication Maternal-fetal Fetal Cephalopelvic disproportion Failed operative vaginal delivery Placenta previa or vasa previa Placental abruption Nonreassuring fetal status Malpresentation Macrosomia Congenital anomaly Abnormal umbilical cord Doppler study Thrombocytopenia Prior neonatal birth trauma Breech presentation during late pregnancy (Option A): A breech presentation, where the baby is positioned feet or buttocks first instead of the head, increases the risk of complications during vaginal delivery. Macrosomia (Option B): A baby with macrosomia may have difficulty passing through the birth canal, increasing the likelihood of birth trauma. Abnormal fetal heart rate pattern during labor (Option C): Non-reassuring fetal heart rate patterns may indicate fetal distress, prompting the need for expedited delivery via cesarean section to prevent harm to the baby.
