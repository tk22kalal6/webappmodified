      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: B) Manually replace the uterus and administer tocolytics. Explanation: The clinical scenario suggests acute uterine inversion, a rare but life-threatening obstetric emergency that can be caused by : Excessive traction on the umbilical cord during placental delivery. Fundal pressure before placental separation. Inherent weakness of the uterine wall. Placenta accreta or percreta. Short umbilical cord. It presents with sudden severe lower abdominal pain, heavy vaginal bleeding, a visible or palpable vaginal mass, absent uterine fundus on palpation, and signs of shock including tachycardia and hypotension. Management includes immediate manual replacement (repositioning) of the uterus by administering tocolytics (e.g., terbutaline, nitroglycerin) to help relax the uterus for easier repositioning. Classification: First degree: Fundus of the uterus collapsed but hasn’t come through the cervix. Second degree: Fundus protrudes through the cervical os. Third degree: Fundus protrudes to or beyond the introitus. Fourth degree: Both the uterus and vagina protrude outside the introitus. Administer oxytocin and perform uterine massage (Option A): Oxytocin and massage will cause the uterus to contract, making repositioning more difficult and potentially worsening the inversion. Perform immediate hysterectomy (Option C): While hysterectomy may be necessary in severe, irreducible cases, it's not the first-line treatment. Repositioning should be attempted first. Apply warm compresses and wait for spontaneous reduction (Option D) : Uterine inversion is an emergency requiring immediate intervention. Waiting for spontaneous reduction is dangerous and can lead to severe haemorrhage and shock.",

      "question": "A 32-year-old multiparous woman has just delivered a healthy baby boy vaginally. The obstetrician is now managing the third stage of labour and is observing for signs of placental separation. Which of the following signs is the most definitive sign of placental separation?",

        "D": "Uterus becoming firm and globular"
      },
      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: A) Permanent lengthening of the umbilical cord Explanation: When the placenta detaches from the uterine wall, it descends towards the birth canal, pulling on the umbilical cord and causing it to visibly lengthen outside the vagina. This is considered to be the most reliable sign of placental separation. A gush of blood from the vagina (Option B) : This is often seen, especially in the Schultze method of separation, but it's not the surest sign. Some blood loss can occur before complete separation. Rising of the uterine fundus (Option C): This sign, also known as the 'rising sign', suggests placental separation but can be affected by factors like bladder fullness or uterine tone. Uterus becoming firm and globular (Option D): The uterus becoming firm and globular during the third stage of labour indicates uterine contraction and preparation for placental expulsion. It is the earliest sign of placental separation. Reference: Williams Textbook of Obstetrics, 26th edition, Page 412",

        "D": "Credé maneuver"
      },
      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: A) Schultze method Explanation: The Schultze method is the most common method of placental separation, occurring in about 80% of deliveries. In this method, placental separation initiates at the centre of the placenta, leading to the formation of a retroplacental hematoma as detachment progresses. The placenta descends through the birth canal, undergoing inversion, resulting in the fetal surface presenting first (Shiny part of Placenta). A distinctive feature of this method of placental separation is a sudden gush of blood upon complete detachment from the uterine wall. As the placenta emerges, it resembles an inverted umbrella at the vulva, with its maternal surface facing outward. Duncan method(Option B) In this method, placental separation starts at the peripheral margin and descends sideways through the birth canal, maintaining its disc shape. This process is marked by slow, steady bleeding rather than a sudden gush. When the placenta emerges, the maternal surface presents first at the vulva, contrasting with the inverted appearance in central separation. Manual removal(Option C) This method involves manual intervention by the obstetrician to detach and remove the placenta when it fails to separate and deliver naturally. It is used in cases of retained placenta or when other delivery methods are unsuccessful. Crede manoeuvre(Option D) This placental delivery technique involves applying fundal pressure to expel the placenta. It is no longer routinely recommended due to risks of partial separation and retained fragments, leading to complications like postpartum haemorrhage and infection.",

      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: A) Cardiovascular anomalies Explanation: Cardiovascular and genitourinary anomalies are the most common congenital anomalies associated with a Single Umbilical Artery (SUA). Single Uterine artery: Single umbilical artery (SUA) occurs in 0.63% of liveborn neonates. SUA is often associated with significant malformations, prompting targeted sonography and especially fetal echocardiography. Common associated anomalies are cardiovascular (such as Ventricular septal defect (VSD), AtrioVentricular septal defect (AVSD), and hypoplastic left heart syndrome (HLHS)) and genitourinary abnormalities. SUA increases the risk of aneuploidy, such as trisomy 18 and 13; amniocentesis for karyotype assessment is recommended. Isolated SUA in low-risk pregnancies significantly increases fetal growth restriction and perinatal death; hence, clinical growth monitoring is recommended. Gastrointestinal anomalies (Option B): While less common than cardiovascular anomalies, gastrointestinal defects are also associated with SUA, including conditions like omphalocele, gastroschisis, and intestinal atresia. Skeletal anomalies (Option C): Skeletal defects associated with SUA include limb reductions and vertebral anomalies, though they are less common than cardiovascular and genitourinary anomalies. Neural tube defects (Option D) : Neural tube defects, such as spina bifida and anencephaly, are least commonly associated with SUA.

      "question": "A 30-year-old woman at 32 weeks gestation presents with painless vaginal bleeding. An earlier ultrasound showed a low-lying placenta, and the non-stress test revealed a sinusoidal fetal heart rate pattern with a heart rate of 100 bpm. Maternal vital signs are stable.

        "D": "Alkaline denaturation test"
      },
      "correct_answer": "D",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: D) Alkaline denaturation test Explanation: An alkaline denaturation test distinguishes fetal blood from maternal blood, as fetal blood is more resistant to denaturation by alkali or acid. The clinical scenario of a low-lying placenta, sinusoidal fetal heart rate pattern, and a fetal heart rate of 100 bpm raises suspicion for Vasa Previa. This condition involves fetal blood vessels traversing the membranes over the cervix, unprotected by the placenta or umbilical cord, posing a significant risk of fetal haemorrhage . These vessels can tear during cervical dilation or membrane rupture, leading to rapid fetal blood loss. Vasa previa is of two types : Type 1: Vessels are part of a velamentous cord insertion. Type 2: Vessels span between parts of a bilobate or succenturiate placenta. An Alkaline denaturation test, or Apt test, is the most appropriate test to distinguish fetal blood loss from maternal blood loss . Kleihauer-Betke test (Option A) This test detects fetal red blood cells in the maternal circulation, which helps in diagnosing fetomaternal haemorrhage in Rh isoimmunisation. Doppler ultrasound(Option B) Doppler ultrasound is valuable in diagnosing vasa previa by visualising fetal vessels over the cervix, but it does not determine whether the bleeding is fetal or maternal once it has occurred. Fetal fibronectin test (Option C) This test is used to predict the risk of preterm labour by detecting fetal fibronectin in vaginal secretions. It has no role in identifying the source of vaginal bleeding.",

      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: C) Emergency cesarean section Explanation: The most appropriate next step in management for the given clinical scenario is to deliver the fetus via cesarean section. Placenta Previa: Placenta previa occurs when the placenta implants in the lower uterine segment, covering or nearing the internal cervical os. Symptoms: Only presentation is painless vaginal bleeding. Classification: Placenta previa: Placenta partially or completely covers the internal os. Low-lying placenta: The placental edge lies within 2 cm of the internal os but does not cover it. Marginal previa: Previously described a placenta at the edge of the internal os without covering it. Management: This patient has active bleeding and is at term. Observation in a high-risk ward is only considered for minor bleeding before 34 weeks of gestation. As this patient is at term, a cesarean section is the best option ( Option A) Normal delivery is contraindicated in placenta previa as the placenta is delivered first, which causes fetal hypoxia and fetal death and also leads to postpartum haemorrhage in the mother ( Option B) Per vaginal examination, is contraindicated in this case of placenta previa as it can further precipitate bleeding ( Option D)",

      "correct_answer": "D",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: D) The umbilical artery converts into the medial umbilical ligament. Explanation: Normal Umbilical cord: The umbilical Cord connects the fetal umbilicus to the centre of the placental chorionic plate. (Option B) The umbilical cord typically contains two arteries and one vein (Option A is ruled out), with the right umbilical vein disappearing early (by the 12th week), leaving the left vein behind (Option C is ruled out). Oxygenated blood flows from the umbilical vein to the fetus via the ductus venosus (to the inferior vena cava) or smaller hepatic circulation openings. Deoxygenated blood exits the fetus through two umbilical arteries, which become medial umbilical ligaments after birth. (Option D) The umbilical cord connects the fetal circulation to the placenta, facilitating the exchange of oxygen, nutrients, and waste products. Maternal and fetal blood systems remain separate, with the exchange occurring through the placental barrier. (Option B is ruled out). Wharton's jelly is a primitive mucous connective tissue found between the amniotic epithelium and the umbilical vessels. Its primary function is to cushion, protect, and support the umbilical vessels. Reference: William’s Textbook of Obstetrics, 26th edition, Page 95",

Day 11-13 Placental development begins with the blastocyst implanting into the uterine wall by day 11, leading to lacunar spaces and trabeculae forming by day 13. Stem villi develop from trabeculae, establishing connections between the chorionic and basal plates. Day 21 Villi develop arterio-capillary-venous systems that connect with the embryonic circulation via the body stalk. 3-4 weeks Lacunar spaces merge to form intervillous spaces, which fill with maternal blood. Week 6 The decidua capsularis begins to thin, while the chorion frondosum and decidua basalis undergo robust growth, culminating in the formation of the placenta by week 12.

FFN levels measuring 50 ng/mL or higher in cervicovaginal discharge from 22 weeks onward strongly predict spontaneous preterm birth. This biomarker is highly regarded for its predictive accuracy across diverse populations. Laminin (Option A): Laminin is a glycoprotein found in the basal lamina and plays a role in cell adhesion and signalling. It is important in maintaining the structural integrity of the basement membrane but is not primarily localised at the maternal-fetal interface. Collagen (Option C): Collagen is a structural protein found abundantly in connective tissues, providing strength and support. While collagen is present in the placenta, it is not typically a glycoprotein primarily localised at the maternal-fetal interface. Integrin (Option D): Integrins are cell surface receptors mediating interactions within tissues, including the placenta, but are not predominantly glycoproteins localised at the maternal-fetal interface.

Trophoblastic cells and maternal blood vessels (Option A): Trophoblastic cells contribute to the formation of the placenta, and maternal blood vessels are present in the decidua basalis but are not a defining component of Nitabuch's membrane. Syncytiotrophoblast and cytotrophoblast layers (Option B): Syncytiotrophoblast and cytotrophoblast are layers of cells that make up the fetal portion of the placenta, primarily in the chorionic villi. Chorionic villi and extravillous trophoblasts (Option D): Chorionic villi are finger-like projections of the placenta containing fetal blood vessels, and extravillous trophoblasts, which invade maternal tissues, are integral to the placenta but not to Nitabuch's membrane.

      "question": "A 32-year-old primigravida presents to the antenatal clinic at 36 weeks gestation for a routine check-up. An ultrasound estimates the fetal weight to be 3,000 grams. The placenta is normal in structure and function without any abnormalities. Based on the ultrasound findings, what is the expected weight of the placenta at term?",

        "A": "200 grams",
        "B": "300 grams",
        "C": "400 grams",
        "D": "500 grams"
      },
      "correct_answer": "D",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: D) 500 grams Explanation: At term, the average weight ratio of the placenta to the baby is approximately 1:6. From the given clinical scenario, with a fetal weight of 3,000 grams, the placenta would weigh around 500 grams . At term, the placenta forms a circular disk measuring 15-20 cm in diameter and approximately 3 cm thick, gradually thinning towards its edges. It weighs about 500 g and occupies around 30% of the uterine wall. The fetal side is covered by a smooth, shiny amnion. The umbilical cord is attached centrally and surrounded by visible umbilical vessels. On the maternal side, the surface is textured, sponge-like, and divided by decidual septa into 15-20 cotyledons . Each cotyledon consists of a main stem of a chorionic villus as well as its branches and sub-branches. Attachment typically occurs in the upper part of the uterus, supported by anchoring villi and the fused decidua capsularis and vera. Following delivery, the placenta detaches through the decidua spongiosum. Reference: William’s Obstetrics 26th edition, pg no - 90",

      "question": "During fetal development, which of the following accurately represents the time period of development of the tertiary villus?",

        "A": "13th day",
        "B": "16th day",

      },
      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: C) 21st day Explanation: The chorion is the outermost fetal membrane, consisting initially of two embryonic layers: the outer trophoblast and the inner primitive mesenchyme. By the beginning of the 3rd week of development, the syncytiotrophoblast produces finger-like projections called primary stem villi. By the 16th day, mesodermal cells infiltrate the central core of the villi, forming secondary villi. The mesodermal cells within the villi differentiate into blood cells and blood vessels, establishing a villous capillary system called tertiary villi, completed by the 21st day. Later in development, the vascularised tertiary villi establish connections with the extraembryonic circulatory system, which eventually links with the intraembryonic circulatory system through the body stalk.
