      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: B) Dichorionic diamniotic Explanation: The sonographic findings, including the presence of the lambda sign (also known as the twin peak sign ), indicate a dichorionic diamniotic pregnancy. This is characterized by the presence of two separate chorions and two separate amniotic sacs. The lambda sign is a thick triangular projection of placental tissue seen between the two gestational sacs and occurs when the inner cell mass divides within 3 days of fertilization, leading to dichorionicity. Dichorionic-Diamniotic twins each have their own separate placenta and amniotic sac, forming when the zygote splits early, typically within the first 3 days after fertilization. Timing of Cleavage Placenta & Membrane Status < 72 hours Dichorionic-Diamniotic twins each have their own separate placenta/chorion and amniotic sac. Days 4–7 Monochorionic-Diamniotic twins share one placenta (chorion) but have separate amniotic sacs. Days 8–12 Monochorionic-Monoamniotic twins share both the placenta and the amniotic sac. Day > 13 Conjoined (Siamese) are physically connected and may share organs or tissues, resulting from a very late and incomplete split. In a monochorionic diamniotic (Option A) pregnancy, a T-sign is typically seen, not the lambda sign. This occurs when the division of the inner cell mass happens after",
