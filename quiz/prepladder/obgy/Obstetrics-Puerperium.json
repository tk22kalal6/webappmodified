      },
      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: A) Puerperium is until 6 weeks postpartum; uterine weight - 300 grams Explanation : Puerperium defines the time following delivery during which pregnancy-induced maternal anatomical and physiological changes return to the nonpregnant state. Puerperium begins as soon as the placenta is expelled and is considered to last between 4 and 6 weeks. Involution of uterus in puerperium : Duration Weight of uterus Uterus palpable Immediately after delivery 1000gm (Option C) Just below the umbilicus *for 1st 24 hours no change in fundal height. Thereafter, FH decreases @ about 1.25 cm/day. Fundal height approx. 1 finger breath below the umbilicus on the 2nd postpartum day. 1 week after delivery 500gm (Option B) Midway between the umbilicus and symphysis pubis 2 weeks after delivery 300gm (Option A) Not palpable (becomes pelvic organ) 4 weeks after delivery 100gm (Option D) Involutes completely Reference: 1.

      "explanation": "Correct Answer: D) Amoxiclav Explanation: Amoxicillin + Clavulanic acid (amoxiclav) is the Gold Standard treatment for Endometritis. Puerperal Fever: A rise of temperature reaching 100.4°F (38°C) or more (measured orally) on two separate occasions at 24 hours apart (excluding first 24 hours) within the first 10 days following delivery is called puerperal pyrexia. Causes of Puerperal Fever: Endometritis(most common) Breast engorgement Respiratory infection Pyelonephritis Thrombophlebitis Endometritis: Postpartum uterine infection has been called endometritis, endomyometritis, and endoparametritis. Infection involves the myometrium and parametrial tissues and not just the decidua alone. Clinical Features: Signs: Investigations: Treatment: Fever Pain abdomen Dirty, foul-smelling discharge Lower abdomen tenderness On P/V examination: - Uterine and Adnexal tenderness - Fullness in Pouch of Douglas Leukocytosis Raised ESR & CRP High PCT Amoxicillin + Clavulanic acid ( Gold Standard ) Clindamycin + Aztreonam (for Renal insufficiency) Vancomycin (adjuvant therapy in suspected cases of MRSA) Ampicillin is added to Clindamycin and Gentamicin when there is sepsis or a suspected Enterococcal infection.

        "D": "Endometritis"
      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: B) Retained Placental Fragments Explanation: Subinvolution occurs when the uterus fails to return to its normal size after delivery. The most common cause of subinvolution is retained placental fragments. These fragments prevent the uterus from contracting effectively and undergoing normal involution. Subinvolution Definition The uterus fails to return to its normal size after delivery. Pathogenesis Retained Placental Fragments Incompletely Remodeled Spiral Arteries Infection (most common cause) Clinical features Prolonged Lochia. Irregular/Excessive Uterine Bleeding. Investigations Bimanual Examination: The Uterus is larger and softer than normal. HPE: Perivascular Trophoblasts are seen in Vessel walls - Aberrant Interaction between uterine and trophoblast cells USG Pelvis: Enlarged Uterus with Tubular Hypoechoic areas in the Myometrium. These tubular areas reflect neovascularization and dilated uterine vessels. Treatment Uterotonics. Methergine (Methylergonovine) 0.2mg every 4 hrs for 24-48hrs. IM dose of Methergine + Infusion of Synthetic Oxytocin in 1L Crystalloid. Suspected cases of Infection are treated with Azithromycin, Amoxicillin-Clavulanate or Doxycycline. Curettage is done if bleeding recurs after medical management. Reference: Williams Obstetrics, 26th edition, Pages 636, 637.",

      "question": "A 22-year-old mother feels her 6 day old baby seems to be getting only a small amount of thick, yellowish fluid while breastfeeding, despite proper latch and positioning. She gets anxious, and stressed about it. What is the most likely reason for the difficulty with milk ejection during breastfeeding?",
      "options": {
        "A": "Increased glucocorticoid levels due to stress",
        "B": "Decreased oxytocin release due to anxiety",
        "C": "Decreased prolactin levels promoting lactation",
        "D": "Increased progesterone levels postpartum"
      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: B) Decreased oxytocin release due to anxiety Explanation: In this scenario the thick, yellowish fluid is colostrum and maternal anxiety and stress is interfering with the milk ejection reflex causing difficulty in milk ejection. Milk ejection reflex also known as letting down reflex , is initiated mainly by suckling action of the baby, stimulating the posterior pituitary to secrete oxytocin in a pulsatile fashion which causes contraction of myoepithelial cells in alveoli and milk ducts to express the milk. Factors promoting let-down reflex Factors inhibiting let-down reflex (option B) Infant cry Frequent feeding Proper positioning and latching Pain Breast engorgement Maternal stress, anxiety and depression Types of milk Stage of puerperium Morphology Contents Colostrum 0 to 5 days Yellow, thick High in protein vitamin A sodium chloride lower carbohydrate, fat and potassium Growth factors Transitional 5 days to 2 weeks Bluish white, thinner High in fat and lactose Increased calories Mature From 2 weeks onwards White, watery Adequate quantity of fats, protein and carbohydrates Large amounts of water Note: immunoglobulin A (IgA), complements, macrophages, lymphocytes, lactoferrin and lactoperoxidase are present in all the types of milk. Glucocorticoids (Option A) and prolactin (Option C) are involved in lactogenesis. Progesterone (Option D) inhibits lactogenesis. Also, it does not play a role in milk ejection.",

      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: B) Prolactin Explanation: Prolactin is the single most important galactopoietic hormone. Hormones and breast milk production: Prolactin levels fall after delivery and the basal levels are low in postpartum period Episodic rise is required for subsequent lactation and maintenance in the postpartum period, which happens during each act of suckling. Hormones that favor milk production Hormones that inhibit milk production Prolactin (Option B) Insulin Glucocorticoids Growth hormone Thyroxine Estrogen (Option C) Progesterone (Option D) Oxytocin is involved primarily in milk ejection, not production.
