      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: A) >200 mg/dL Explanation: The recommended target fibrinogen level for patients with active bleeding during postpartum hemorrhage is >200 mg/dL. Laboratory Evaluation Description Routine Laboratory Tests Tests: Complete blood count (including platelet count), Type and crossmatch for multiple units of red blood cells, Coagulation studies (fibrinogen concentration, prothrombin time, activated partial thromboplastin time). Note: Hemoglobin levels drop by ~1 g/dL for every 500 mL of blood loss. Fibrinogen Measurement Fibrinogen levels drop earlier than other coagulation factors and are a sensitive indicator of ongoing blood loss. Normal Range: 350-650 mg/dL in pregnancy. Levels below 200 mg/dL are associated with severe PPH and higher morbidity/mortality. Target: Recommended to maintain fibrinogen levels >200 mg/dL, ideally >300 mg/dL in active bleeding. Viscoelastic Testing: TEG/ROTEM Thromboelastography (TEG) and rotational thromboelastometry (ROTEM). Function: Assess global blood hemostasis by measuring clot development, stabilization, and dissolution. Usage: Effective for guiding plasma and coagulation product therapy. ROTEM Findings: FIBTEM A10 (Amplitude at 10 minutes) ≤ 17 mm is suggestive of low fibrinogen levels. Fibrin-based clot strength (FIBTEM) is an early indicator of bleeding severity. FIBTEM A5 <10 mm may indicate severe PPH. Reference: 1.

      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: B) Uterine atony Explanation: This is a case of Secondary postpartum hemorrhage (PPH) , also known as a delayed or late puerperal hemorrhage , which occurs between 24 hours and 12 weeks after delivery. Clinically significant uterine bleeding occurs in about 1% of women, usually within 1 to 2 weeks of delivery. Uterine atony is the failure of the uterus to contract effectively after delivery and is the most common cause of primary PPH (occurring within the first 24 hours postpartum). It leads to excessive bleeding immediately after birth rather than delayed bleeding. This patient's presentation on postpartum day 10 makes uterine atony an unlikely cause of her current symptoms. Secondary Postpartum Hemorrhage Cause Description Retained Placental Fragments and Membranes (Option A) Most common cause They can prevent proper uterine involution and healing, leading to significant bleeding. Rarely, retained products undergo necrosis and fibrin deposition, forming a placental polyp that can cause severe hemorrhage. Infection Tissue breakdown and delayed healing Endometritis (Option C) Inflammation of the uterine lining and delayed healing. Symptoms typically include fever, uterine tenderness, and foul-smelling lochia. Subinvolution of Placental Site Uterus's failure to return to its normal size after delivery. When the placental site heals slowly, it can increase the risk of secondary bleeding Uterine artery Pseudoaneurysm (Option D) A severe but rare cause of secondary PPH. It occurs when a pseudoaneurysm forms in the uterine artery, leading to delayed hemorrhage. Reference: 1. Williams Obstetrics, 26th Edition, Page 637 2.

      "explanation": "Correct Answer: D) Routine use of recombinant activated factor VII (rFVIIa) Explanation: Routine use of rFVIIa is not recommended in PPH management due to potential risks and lack of evidence supporting its routine application. Therapeutic goals in managing postpartum hemorrhage (PPH) are focused on restoring blood loss, achieving hemostasis, and correcting any coagulopathies. Goals are: Hemoglobin level >8 g/dL .

      "question": "A 36 y/o woman, G3P2, delivered via C-section 4 hours ago and is now experiencing severe PPH unresponsive to uterine massage and uterotonics. Her vital signs show tachycardia and hypotension. The medical team opts for surgical intervention to avoid a hysterectomy. What is the principle behind performing bilateral internal iliac artery ligation to control her PPH?",
      "options": {
        "A": "To apply direct pressure on the bleeding site",

        "D": "To promote rapid healing of uterine tissues"
      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: B) To reduce distal blood flow and convert arterial pressure to venous-like pressure significantly lowering pulse pressure (85% reduction) in arteries distal to the ligation. This reduction in pressure makes the blood vessels more conducive to hemostasis through clot formation, similar to venous circulation. Considerations: Ligation of the internal iliac artery is to be done at 5cm distal to common iliac bifurcation - this avoids the posterior division branches of the internal iliac artery. Should not perforate continuous large veins, esp. Internal iliac vein. Non-absorbable sutures are used. To apply direct pressure on the bleeding site (Option A) is not the principle behind internal iliac artery ligation. This option refers more to methods like uterine tamponade or manual compression, which aim to directly compress the bleeding area to stop hemorrhage. To increase uterine contractility and reduce bleeding (Option C): Increasing uterine contractility is achieved with uterotonic agents like oxytocin, not through surgical ligation of arteries. Internal iliac artery ligation does not affect uterine muscle contraction directly. To promote rapid healing of uterine tissues (Option D) is not the aim of internal iliac artery ligation. The procedure focuses on reducing blood flow to control hemorrhage, not on directly promoting tissue healing.",

      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: B) B-Lynch compression sutures Explanation: B-Lynch compression sutures are designed to tamponade the uterus and control bleeding by compressing the uterine walls. This method has a high success rate (approximately 80%) and is often preferred to avoid a hysterectomy. Given the patient’s clinical status, this is an effective and immediate surgical option. Uterine Devascularization Progressive ligation of more proximal arteries to control uterine bleeding. May require a hysterectomy if unsuccessful. Bilateral Uterine Artery Ligation (Option A) Ligation of the ascending branch of each uterine artery at the lateral border of the uterus. Ovarian and Uterine Artery Anastomosis Ligation Ligation of the anastomosis between ovarian and uterine arteries on each side. Bilateral Internal Iliac Artery Ligation Ligation of the anterior division of the internal iliac artery on one or both sides to reduce blood flow to the uterus. Uterine Compression Sutures Techniques involving sutures to compress the uterus and control bleeding. B-Lynch Suture (Option B) Envelops and compresses the uterus; most common technique. Effective for uterine atony, simple to learn, safe May increase risk of Asherman syndrome. Hayman Technique Uses two to four vertical compression sutures without hysterotomy. Suitable after vaginal birth. Pereira Technique Involves transverse and longitudinal sutures around the uterus without entering the uterine cavity. Requires care to avoid damaging blood vessels, ureters, and fallopian tubes; manual compression before tying sutures. Cho Technique Utilizes multiple squares or rectangles for uterine compression. Uterine Artery Embolization (Option D) Minimally invasive procedure using interventional radiology to block blood flow by injecting embolic material. Hysterectomy (Option C) It is a last resort for PPH, it may be necessary in cases where other measures have failed or when there are compelling reasons to remove the uterus. In emergency situations, a subtotal hysterectomy, where the cervix is left intact, is typically performed.",

      "options": {
        "A": "Intrauterine packing with gauze strips",
        "B": "Intrauterine balloon tamponade",
        "C": "Uterine artery embolization",
        "D": "Immediate referral for emergency hysterectomy"
      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: B) Intrauterine balloon tamponade Explanation: Intrauterine balloon tamponade is often considered the first-line for managing persistent postpartum hemorrhage (PPH) due to uterine atony when initial treatments with uterotonics are ineffective. It involves placing a balloon within the uterus and inflating it to apply pressure and reduce bleeding. This method is less invasive compared to other surgical options and can effectively control bleeding in many cases. Intrauterine Hemorrhage-Control Devices Intrauterine hemorrhage-control devices are typically used for uterine atony unresponsive to medications and massage, often as a step before more invasive surgery. Contraindications: Allergy to any device component or packing material. Retained Products: Should not replace evacuation of retained pregnancy tissue. Intrauterine Balloon Tamponade (Option B) Types: Multiple balloon catheters used for intrauterine tamponade. Examples: Sengstaken tube Bakri, BT-cath, ebb complete Foley's catheter (can hold up to 100 ml of fluids) Condoms Mechanism: Hydrostatic pressure applied inward to outward against uterine wall to reduce blood flow and facilitate clotting. Vacuum-Induced Tamponade Mechanism: Applies low-level intrauterine vacuum (70-90 mmHg) to evacuate blood and clot, facilitating uterine contractions. Intrauterine Packing (Option A) Plain Gauze/Laparotomy Sponges: Traditional packing method; Replaced by balloon tamponade due to its effectiveness. Hemostatic Gauze: Gauze with additional hemostatic mechanisms Compressed Mini-Sponges: Novel device. Uterine or Hypogastric Artery Embolization (Option C) Candidates Suitable for patients with persistent, slow, excessive bleeding. Hemodynamically stable and unresponsive to less invasive treatments. Procedure Performed by an interventional vascular specialist using diagnostic angiography. Gelfoam is the preferred embolizing agent (temporary occlusion: 2-6 weeks). Immediate referral for emergency hysterectomy ( Option D) is considered when other methods fail or if there are specific indications such as uterine rupture or severe trauma, but it is not typically the first-line choice.",

      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "affecting the second baby. Correct Answer: C) Avoid administration completely due to the risk of uterine tetanic contractions affecting the second baby. Explanation: Methylergometrine is contraindicated in suspected multiple pregnancies after the delivery of the first baby because it can cause strong uterine contractions that may compromise the remaining fetus. The appropriate management is to avoid using methylergometrine until after all babies have been delivered. Methylergometrine Mode of Action Directly acts on the myometrium, causing strong and frequent uterine contractions, leading to uterine spasms. Administration Oral Dose: 0.2 mg taken 3 to 4 times daily during the puerperium. Duration: Up to 7 days (maximum). IM/IV Dose: 0.2 mg administered after delivery of the anterior shoulder, placenta, or during puerperium. Repeat every 2 to 4 hours if necessary. IV is reserved for life-threatening situations. Uses Prophylactic: Active management of the third stage of labor to prevent excessive bleeding post-delivery. Therapeutic: To control atonic uterine bleeding after delivery, abortion, or expulsion of a hydatidiform mole.

      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: B) Oxytocin acts as an antidiuretic hormone (ADH), causing water retention retention . This water retention dilutes the sodium concentration in the blood, causing hyponatremia. Oxytocin Infusion Initiation Oxytocin is given before or after placental separation to reduce postpartum bleeding and hemorrhage risk. Infusion rates can be increased if bleeding exceeds normal levels. Administration Intramuscular: 10 units (including directly into the myometrium). Intravenous: 10 to 30 units in 500 mL normal saline or 20 to 60 units in 1 L normal saline, with a bolus over 10 to 15 minutes, followed by maintenance infusion at a lower rate. Maximum infusion: 40 units/hour. Higher doses (e.g., up to 80 units in 500 mL over 30 minutes) are avoided to minimize fluid overload. Side Effects Common: Flushing due to peripheral vasodilation. Serious: Rapid IV administration of high doses can cause hypotension, tachycardia, chest pain, cardiovascular collapse, and rarely, water retention leading to hyponatremia. Carbetocin Long-acting analog of oxytocin , used for preventing uterine atony and hemorrhage. Administration: 100 mcg IV slow injection (over one minute); lower doses may also be effective.

      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: B) Administer 2 litres of crystalloids rapidly. Explanation: The patient shows signs of shock from postpartum hemorrhage. Initial management involves rapid volume resuscitation with crystalloids (normal saline) to stabilize hemodynamics, improve perfusion, and support vital organs. Management Strategy Description Resuscitate with Crystalloid and Blood Crystalloid: Typically, isotonic crystalloids are infused to prevent hypotension and maintain urine output (>30 mL/hour). Infuse up to twice the lost volume or 3.5 L for significant blood loss. Monitor hematocrit, coagulation, core temperature, and electrolytes to avoid dilutional coagulopathy and imbalances. Monitor urine output. Blood Products: Early blood product replacement is advised for heavy hemorrhage to replace RBCs, platelets, and coagulation factors. Aggressive transfusion: For unstable patients to minimize risks. Fibrinogen Concentrate Heat-treated, lyophilized fibrinogen powder from pooled human plasma. Each 50 mL vial contains ~1000 mg fibrinogen. Administered alone or with cryoprecipitate. Indications: Critically low fibrinogen levels (<100 mg/dL) when FFP and cryoprecipitate are unavailable. Prothrombin Complex Concentrate (PCC) Available in three-factor (II, IX, X) and four-factor (II, VII, IX, X) forms. Indications: Urgent reversal of acquired factor deficiencies due to vitamin K antagonists. Recombinant Factor VIIa (rFVIIa) Off-label for severe postpartum hemorrhage (PPH). Dosage: 16.7 to 120 mcg/kg, typically starting at 40-60 mcg/kg. Repeat if there is no response. Advantages: Effective in refractory bleeding; dose titration possible. Maintain Oxygenation Ensure oxygen saturation >95% with high-flow oxygen (10-15 L/min). Assess the airway and intubate if necessary. Advantages: Improves oxygen-carrying capacity. Considerations: Low flow rates may lead to CO2 retention and worsen conditions. Avoid Hypothermia and Acidosis Maintain normothermia (temperature ≥ 35.5°C) and correct acidosis if needed. Advantages: Prevents coagulopathy and adverse outcomes. Considerations: Use warming devices and correct pH if <7.1. Acidosis correction can improve pH without bicarbonate. Consider Uterine or Hypogastric Artery Embolization Performed by an interventional specialist; options include Gelfoam (temporary occlusion) or N-butyl cyanoacrylate (permanent).

Antibiotic prophylaxis Ampicillin or cefazolin prophylaxis post-procedure (WHO) Difficulties Hour-glass contraction leads to difficulty in introducing the hand. Morbid adherent placenta causes difficulty in reaching the plane of placental separation, necessitating gentle removal in fragments using ovum forceps. Complications Hemorrhage due to incomplete removal Shock Uterine injury Infection Inversion (rare) Subinvolution Thrombophlebitis Embolism The aseptic technique is unnecessary due to the urgency of the situation (Option C): The aseptic technique is essential to prevent infection, even in urgent situations. Immediate traction on the umbilical cord to expedite placental expulsion (Option D) is contraindicated as it can increase the risk of uterine inversion and should be avoided. Reference: 1.

      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: C) Vigorous fundal massage combined with a uterotonic agent Explanation: Vigorous fundal massage helps to maintain uterine tone and prevent uterine atony , a common cause of postpartum hemorrhage. Combining it with a uterotonic agent like oxytocin further enhances uterine contraction, reducing the risk of excessive bleeding. Active Management of the Third Stage of Labor (AMTSL) for PPH: Uterine Massage : Always palpate the uterine fundus after placental delivery. Vigorous fundal massage , combined with a uterotonic agent , is recommended to prevent PPH due to uterine atony. During immediate PPH, perform uterine massage while evaluating for other bleeding sources and administering uterotonic agents. Oxytocin : Recommended by WHO as a first-line prophylactic treatment for postpartum hemorrhage. Administer 20 units of oxytocin in 1,000 mL of crystalloid solution intravenously at 10 mL/min for a dose of 200 mU/min. (Option A) Never administer oxytocin as an undiluted bolus due to risks of severe hypotension or cardiac arrhythmias. Intravenous oxytocin is also a first-line treatment for uterine atony. Oxytocin 10 units can be given IM with the delivery of the anterior shoulder (Option B) Delayed Cord Clamping/Controlled Cord Traction (CCT) : If placental separation is evident, perform expression via fundal pressure or controlled cord traction. If the placenta is not separated, perform manual removal under general anesthesia. Delivery of the placenta by cord traction before placental separation especially in an atonic uterus may cause uterine inversion. (Option D) Reference: 1.

      "explanation": "Correct Answer: D) Endometritis Explanation: Endometritis, an infection of the uterine lining, often causes secondary PPH with delayed bleeding, fever, uterine tenderness, and foul-smelling lochia and is not consistent with this patient’s symptoms. Causes of Primary PPH Cause Description Factors Increasing Risk Uterine Atony (Option A) The inability of the uterus to contract effectively after delivery leads to a soft and boggy uterus and continuous bleeding from the placental site. Grand multiparity Overdistension of the uterus: Multiple pregnancies, hydramnios, large baby Malnutrition, and anemia Antepartum hemorrhage: Placenta previa and placental abruption Prolonged labour Anesthesia Oxytocin use. Uterine malformations Other factors: Obesity, h/o PPH, advanced maternal age (over 40 years), tocolytics and magnesium sulfate Retained Tissue (Option B) Prevents proper uterine contraction, causing primary PPH with continued bleeding and incomplete contraction. Although more commonly associated with secondary PPH, retained placental fragments can also be a cause of primary PPH. Trauma to the genital tract (Option C) Cervical, vaginal, or perineal tears are a significant cause of primary PPH . This type of bleeding occurs despite a well-contracted uterus. Assisted deliveries Rapid labor Large babies Thrombin (Coagulopathy) Involves disorders of blood clotting, which are a less common cause of PPH. They can be acquired or congenital.

      "explanation": "Correct Answer: D) Early cord clamping Early cord clamping is NOT recommended as part of active management of 3rd stage of labor to prevent the risk of PPH. Delayed cord clamping is followed in all vigorous newborns irrespective of the mode of delivery. The most important component is prophylactic uterotonics (oxytocin DOC) given immediately after delivery of the baby (within 1 min). Controlled cord traction is recommended to be followed by skilled birth attendants to deliver the placenta; it is to be done along with uterine contractions. Uterine massage can also be done to rub up a uterine contraction, however the WHO recommends intermittent uterine tone assessment. Reference: 1. Williams Obstetrics, 26th Edition, Page 734,735,736 2.

      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: B) Physiological anemia of pregnancy Explanation: Hemoglobin of 10.4 g/dL in the second trimester is consistent with the normal physiological nadir in pregnancy. MCV of 85 fL is within normal range → not microcytic → iron deficiency unlikely. WBC count elevation is expected in pregnancy due to neutrophilic leukocytosis. The patient is asymptomatic, making physiological adaptation more likely than pathology. Blood Parameter Changes During Pregnancy Parameter Change in Pregnancy Clinical Notes Total Blood Volume ↑ by ~40–50% (~1.5 L) Plasma increase exceeds RBC mass → hemodilution Plasma Volume ↑ more than RBC mass Begins in 1st trimester, peaks in 2nd RBC Count ↓ in 1st and 2nd trimester, slight ↑ in 3rd Due to dilution; erythropoiesis increases in 3rd trimester Hemoglobin (Hb) ↓ throughout pregnancy Avg: 1st trimester ~11.6 g/dL, 2nd ~10.5 g/dL (nadir), 3rd ~11.0 g/dL ; anemia if <11, <10.5, <11 g/dL respectively (WHO) Hematocrit (Hct) ↓ due to plasma expansion Mirrors Hb changes MCV Slight ↑ (~4 fL) Peaks at 30–35 weeks in iron-replete women WBC Count ↑ (median ~9.06 × 10 I /L) Mainly neutrophils; physiological leukocytosis Neutrophils ↑ significantly Progressive rise through pregnancy Lymphocytes ↓ slightly Minor change Platelets ↓ mildly Often stays just above 100 × 10 I /L → gestational thrombocytopenia Fibrinogen ↑ markedly Levels may reach 400–600 mg/dL Clotting Factors ↑ (VII, VIII, X, XII, vWF, ristocetin) Supports clot formation for delivery aPTT ↓ by ~4 seconds Due to increased factor VIII PT, TT ↔ (no significant change) Remain within normal range Pathological anemia due to folate deficiency (Option A): Incorrect because folate deficiency typically causes macrocytic anemia (MCV >100 fL), which is not seen here. Iron-deficiency anemia (Option C): Incorrect because iron deficiency anemia shows low MCV (<84 fL) and more severe Hb drop. Here, MCV is normal. Pancytopenia due to bone marrow suppression (Option D): Incorrect because WBC is elevated, not decreased; no evidence of marrow failure.

      "explanation": "Correct Answer: D) All of the above Explanation: PPH can be defined in various ways depending on context. The WHO , clinical , and ACOG definitions all provide a comprehensive understanding, considering both quantitative measures and clinical impacts. All these definitions are valid and relevant in different scenarios. Definition WHO Blood loss exceeding 500 mL following childbirth. This quantitative measure is useful for statistical purposes but may not always reflect the clinical severity of the condition. (Option A) Clinical Definition Any amount of bleeding from or into the genital tract after childbirth that negatively affects the patient's general condition. This clinical definition of PPH emphasizes the impact of blood loss on the mother's health rather than the exact volume, highlighting the importance of assessing the patient's condition, including elevated pulse rate and drop in blood pressure. (Option B) ACOG - The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists Cumulative blood loss of more than 1000 mL or any amount of blood loss with signs and symptoms of hypovolemia This definition acknowledges that even smaller amounts of blood loss can be clinically significant if they cause hypovolemia. (Option C) Beyond these primary definitions, PPH based on blood loss volume is categorized as : Minor PPH: Blood loss < 1L. Major PPH: Blood loss > 1L. Severe PPH: Blood loss > 2L. Reference: 1.
