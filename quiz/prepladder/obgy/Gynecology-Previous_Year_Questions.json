      "question": "Dr. Priya is conducting a talk on the screening of cervical cancer with a Pap smear. She works in a clinic in a low-resource setting, and she was planning to screen a woman in her 20s. Which of the following is true regarding cervical cancer screening guidelines in her workplace?",
      "options": {
        "A": "Co-testing (pap and Hr HPV) every 5 years starting at 25 years",
        "B": "Pap smear every 3 years, starting at 21 years",
        "C": "Hr HPV testing every 5 years starting at 30 years",
        "D": "Pap smear every 5 years starting at 21 years"
      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: B) Pap smear every 3 years, starting at 21 years Explanation: Cervical cancer screening guidelines recommend starting a pap smear at age 21 and repeating it every 3 years in a low-resource setting. ACOG Protocol for Cervical Cancer Screening: Population Recommendation Aged less than 21 years No screening Aged 21-29 years Cytology alone every 3 years Aged 30-65 years Any one of the following: Cytology alone every 3 years FDA-approved primary hrHPV testing alone every 5 years Cotesting (hrHPV testing and cytology) every 5 years Aged greater than 65 years No screening after adequate negative prior screening results Hysterectomy with removal of the cervix No screening in individuals without a history of high-grade cervical precancerous lesions or cervical cancer WHO Cervical Cancer Screening Guidelines: Population Strategy Screening Test Starting Age Screening Interval General population of women Screen and Treat or Screen, Triage and Treat HPV DNA as primary test 30 years Every 5 to 10 years Women living with HIV Screen, Triage, and Treat only HPV DNA as primary test 25 years Every 3 to 5 years Co-testing (Pap and Hr HPV) every 5 years starting at 25 years (Option A) is recommended for women aged 25 and older, typically in higher-resource settings where both Pap smear and HPV testing are accessible. Hr HPV testing every 5 years starting at 30 years (Option C) is recommended for women aged 30 and older, as younger women tend to clear HPV infections on their own and are less likely to develop cervical cancer from HPV. Pap smear every 5 years starting at 21 years (Option D) is not standard; Pap smears are typically done every 3 years starting at age 21 according to most guidelines.

      "question": "26-year-old P1L1 presents with abdominal pain. She has a past history of rheumatic heart disease for which she has undergone mitral valve replacement surgery and is on the oral tablet Warfarin 3mg OD. On examination, 14 weeks of abdominal mass were felt. On USG, an 8 X 6 cm unilocular cyst with a reticular pattern was observed in the left ovary. What is the next line of management?",
      "options": {
        "A": "Measure CA-125",
        "B": "Repeat USG after 6-12 weeks",
        "C": "Surgical intervention",
        "D": "MRI pelvis"
      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: B) Repeat USG after 6-12 weeks Explanation: The patient presents with abdominal pain, a history of mitral valve replacement, and an ovarian cyst with a reticular pattern on ultrasound, suggesting a benign ovarian cyst. The next line of management is to repeat USG after 6-12 weeks to monitor for any changes, as many unilocular cysts resolve spontaneously. Functional Ovarian Cysts: Arise from ovarian follicles during follicle maturation and ovulation. Types: Single Cysts: Most common, often a single follicular or corpus luteum cyst. Multiple Cysts: Can occur in conditions like: Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS) Ovarian Hyperstimulation Syndrome (OHSS) FSH-secreting pituitary adenomas Features: Functional cysts are typically 3–7 cm, and those larger than 10 cm or persistent for more than 3 months may require further investigation for malignancy. Related to hormonal variations. Filled with clear fluid (unless hemorrhage occurs). Benign, often asymptomatic Typically resolve on their own Management: Observation: Most cysts resolve spontaneously within 4-6 months. Follow-up: Regular ultrasound after 6-12 weeks to monitor persistent or enlarging cysts. Symptomatic Treatment: Combined oral contraceptives (COCs) may be prescribed for pain or irregular menses. Surgery: Indicated for cysts larger than 10 cm, persistent, or symptomatic (e.g., pain, torsion). Measure CA 125 levels (Option A): Elevated CA 125 can indicate ovarian cancer but is often raised in benign conditions like menstruation, endometriosis, or pelvic inflammatory disease. It is primarily useful in postmenopausal women with suspected malignancy. Surgical intervention (Option C): Immediate surgery is unnecessary for a simple ovarian cyst. Surgery is typically considered if the cyst persists, grows, or causes acute symptoms like torsion or rupture. MRI pelvis (Option D): Transvaginal ultrasound is the preferred imaging modality for ovarian cysts. MRI is typically used for complex or uncertain cases, which is not necessary here.

      "question": "A 35-year-old P2L2 woman presents with malodorous vaginal discharge and a normal cervix. The whiff test is positive. What is this condition?",
      "options": {
        "A": "Candida",

        "C": "Bacterial vaginosis",
        "D": "Physiological cause"
      },
      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: C) Bacterial vaginosis Explanation: The positive whiff test with malodorous discharge in the female is characteristic of bacterial vaginosis. Bacterial Vaginosis (BV): A polymicrobial condition characterized by an alteration in normal vaginal flora. Minimal inflammatory response; few leukocytes in vaginal fluid. Pathogenesis: Decreased lactobacilli, leading to increased pH and overgrowth of anaerobic bacteria. Common bacteria: Gardnerella vaginalis, Mobiluncus spp., Mycoplasma hominis, and Haemophilus vaginalis. Not sexually transmitted. Symptoms: 50% are asymptomatic. Vaginal discharge: white, milky, non-viscous, and adherent. Minimal vulval irritation. Amsel's Criteria (Diagnostic Features): White, milky, nonviscous discharge adherent to the vaginal wall. Discharge with pH >4.5. Fishy odor on adding 10% KOH ( whiff test ). Presence of clue cells on wet mount. Reduced lactobacilli and increased pathogenic bacteria. Complications: Pelvic inflammatory disease (PID) Chorioamnionitis Premature rupture of membranes (PROM) Preterm labor Treatment: Metronidazole (DOC): 400 mg twice daily for 7 days (effective in 85%). A single 1 g dose cures only 45%. Clindamycin: 2% cream locally (85% effective). Oral 300 mg daily for 7 days. Alternatives: Ampicillin, cephalosporin, tetracycline, doxycycline, or sulfa drugs. Candida (Option A) causes thick, white, cottage cheese-like discharge, itching, and presents with pseudohyphae and yeast cells on KOH mount, but not a fishy odor or positive whiff test. Trichomonas vaginalis (Option C) causes frothy, greenish-yellow discharge with itching, burning, and motile trichomonas on wet mount, but lacks a fishy odor and positive whiff test. Physiological cause (Option D) results in clear, odorless discharge that varies with the menstrual cycle and does not have a fishy odor or a positive whiff test.",

      "question": "An athlete with a BMI of 17.5 kg/m2 presents with secondary amenorrhea and primary infertility. Her laboratory investigations reveal FSH 2, LH 0.3, and TSH 1.2. Prolactin 20ng/ml. What is the underlying cause of this condition?",
      "options": {
        "A": "Primary ovarian failure",
        "B": "Hypogonadotropic hypogonadism",
        "C": "Hypergonadotropic hypogonadism",
        "D": "Normogonadotropic normogonadism"
      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: B) Hypogonadotropic hypogonadism Explanation: The low FSH and LH levels with a history of low BMI in an athlete indicate reduced GnRH production, consistent with hypogonadotropic hypogonadism. Hypogonadotropic Hypogonadism (HH): It results from hypothalamic or pituitary dysfunction, leading to inadequate gonadotropin secretion. Classification: Congenital HH: Anosmic HH (e.g., Kallmann syndrome): Associated with impaired or absent sense of smell; MRI may show absent or abnormal olfactory bulbs. Congenital Normosmic Isolated HH: Normal sense of smell. Acquired HH: May result from tumors, trauma, weight loss, excessive exercise , stress, systemic illness, or medications. Clinical Characteristics: Androgen deficiency: Decreased libido, erectile dysfunction, muscle weakness, and increased adiposity. Impaired or delayed pubertal sexual maturation. Depressed mood, decreased vitality, reduced bone density, and infertility. Diagnosis: Low testosterone and low levels of pituitary hormones (LH and FSH). Low serum levels of estradiol. Stimulated intravenous GnRH test may help confirm the diagnosis. MRI for anosmic HH may reveal anomalies in olfactory structures. Management: Hormonal Therapy: Used to stimulate sexual development and regularize menstrual cycles in cases of congenital HH. Cause-Specific Therapy: Targeted treatment for acquired causes based on the underlying condition. Fertility Treatment: Ovulation induction using GnRH or gonadotropins. Primary ovarian failure (Option A) is marked by irregular or absent menstrual cycles, with elevated FSH and decreased estradiol levels indicating a primary ovarian defect. This condition typically results in sterility, which does not align with the patient’s suppressed FSH and LH levels in this case. Hypergonadotropic Hypogonadism (Option C) is associated with ovarian failure leading to high FSH and LH due to a lack of negative feedback from the ovaries. It is not relevant here as the patient’s gonadotropin levels are suppressed, not elevated. Normogonadotropic Normogonadism (Option D) implies normal hypothalamic-pituitary function, with FSH and LH levels in the normal range. Amenorrhea in such cases is often due to PCOS or other structural or systemic causes, none of which align with the suppressed gonadotropins seen in this patient.

      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "hyperandrogenism, and polycystic ovaries on ultrasound. The first-line management of PCOS is lifestyle modifications , including weight loss, diet, and exercise. Even a 5% reduction in body weight can significantly improve hormonal balance, insulin sensitivity, ovulation, and metabolic outcomes. Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS) Management: Goals of Treatment: Managing menstrual irregularities, hirsutism, acne, infertility, and preventing long-term risks like metabolic syndrome. 1. Lifestyle Modifications (First-line treatment for all PCOS patients) Weight loss (>5% of body weight) improves hormonal balance, increases SHBG, and reduces insulin & testosterone levels. Smoking cessation lowers DHEA & androgen levels while increasing estrogen levels. 2. Menstrual Cycle Regulation & Androgen Suppression Treatment Mechanism Benefits OCPs (First-line for menstrual regulation & hirsutism) (Option C) Estrogen increases SHBG, reducing free testosterone; Progestogen suppresses LH & androgen production Regulates cycles, reduces acne & hirsutism Anti-androgenic OCPs (Preferred) Cyproterone acetate or Drospirenone Best for hirsutism & acne Spironolactone + OCPs Blocks androgen receptors Reduces hirsutism & acne Eflornithine Cream (Topical) Inhibits hair growth Used for facial hirsutism 3. Acne Management Topical clindamycin (1%) or erythromycin (2%) for mild cases. Isotretinoin for severe acne (teratogenic, avoid in pregnancy). 4. Ovulation Induction & Fertility Treatment Drug Mechanism Benefits Side Effects Letrozole (Preferred Over Clomiphene Citrate) Aromatase inhibitor No anti-estrogenic effects on endometrium & cervix → higher pregnancy rates, monofollicular stimulation, no ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (OHSS) Drowsiness Clomiphene Citrate (Option D) Selective estrogen receptor modulator Induces ovulation in 80%, conception in 40-45% Anti-estrogenic effects on endometrium & cervix lower fertility, OHSS in <1% Tamoxifen (Resistant Cases) Estrogen receptor modulator Used when Clomiphene fails (80-160 mg for 5 days) – Dexamethasone (Adjunct) Lowers adrenal androgens Improves ovulation outcomes – 5. Insulin Sensitizers (For insulin resistance & metabolic issues) Drug Mechanism Benefits and side effects Metformin (Option A) Improves insulin sensitivity, reduces hepatic glucose production, lowers testosterone levels Benefits: Increases ovulation (70-80%), conception (30-40%). S/E: GI disturbances, lactic acidosis, avoid in liver/kidney disease N-acetylcysteine (NAC) + Micronutrients Lowers homocysteine, improves insulin resistance Alternative to Metformin in some cases Acarbose (Alternative to Metformin) Delays glucose absorption Used if Metformin is contraindicated 6. Surgery is reserved for cases where: Medical therapy fails Ovarian hyperstimulation occurs Infertility persists despite treatment Recurrent pregnancy losses Procedure: Laparoscopic ovarian drilling (LOD) using laser or unipolar electrocautery, targeting no more than four cysts per ovary. This helps restore the endocrine balance and improves fertility for 6-12 months. However, pelvic adhesions from surgery may reduce fertility, which can be minimized using hydroflotation techniques.

More pronounced reduction seen in smokers, obese women, and those with low physical activity. Ovarian Cancer Protective Risk reduced by 30–50% , with greater protection in long-term users. The effect persists for 10–15 years after stopping, even with short-term use ( ≥ 6 months). Protection extends to BRCA1/BRCA2 mutation carriers. Colorectal Cancer Protective Risk reduced by 15–20% . Breast Cancer Increased Risk COC use increases risk by 25% , especially in nulliparous women who start before age 24 and use it for >4 years. If breast cancer develops, it is usually well-differentiated with a good prognosis . The increased risk disappears after 10 years of stopping. Cervical Cancer Increased Risk Prolonged COC use increases risk, particularly of adenocarcinoma of the cervix. Women using COCs for ≥ 5 years have a higher risk, with risk increasing with longer duration. Reference: Shaw’s Textbook of Gynecology, 17th Edition, Pages 314-318",

Components of PCOS : Increased androgens Ovulatory dysfunction Polycystic ovaries Clinical features : Usually present in young women Central obesity (BMI > 30kg/cm 2 ), waistline> 88cm. Oligomenorrhea, amenorrhoea Infertility Hirsutism Acanthosis nigricans due to insulin resistance Endometriosis (Option B) involves the growth of endometrial tissue outside the uterus and presents with pelvic pain, dysmenorrhea and infertility. While it can cause irregular menstrual cycles, it does not typically cause acne, hirsutism, or multiple ovarian cysts. Hypothyroidism (Option C) can cause menstrual irregularities, weight gain, and fatigue. However, it does not commonly present with acne, hirsutism, or multiple ovarian cysts. Ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (OHSS) (Option D): This condition can occur as a complication of Assisted Reproductive Technology (ART), particularly in individuals who have undergone ovulation induction with medication. The ultrasound may reveal multiple ovarian cysts, but the clinical presentation is typically characterized by acute abdominal pain rather than irregular menstrual cycles, acne, or hirsutism.

      "question": "A 35-year-old female patient presents to the clinic for evaluation of her fertility status. She has been trying to conceive for over a year without success. Which of the following is the single best test for assessing her ovarian reserve?",
      "options": {
        "A": "Follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) on day 3",

      },
      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: C) Anti-Müllerian hormone (AMH) Explanation: Anti-Müllerian hormone (AMH) levels correlate with the number of antral follicles in the ovaries and provide a direct measure of ovarian reserve. AMH is less variable throughout the menstrual cycle and is considered the most reliable single test for assessing ovarian reserve. Tests for Ovarian Reserve: Test Name Description Key Points Anti-Müllerian Hormone (AMH) A hormone produced by ovarian antral follicles. Blood test reflecting the remaining quantity of eggs. Not affected by the menstrual cycle. The single best test for assessing her ovarian reserve Antral Follicle Count (AFC) Ultrasound count of the small follicles (antral follicles) within the ovaries. Direct visual assessment. Can vary with the cycle. Baseline assessment and monitoring. Follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) Measures the level of FSH, which stimulates the growth of ovarian follicles. Blood test done on day 3 of the menstrual cycle. Initial screening of ovarian function. Estradiol (E2) Measures the level of estradiol, an estrogen produced by growing follicles. Blood test done on day 3 of the menstrual cycle. High levels can mask high FSH levels, so they are used in conjunction with FSH. Inhibin B Measures the level of inhibin B, which reflects the number of antral follicles. Blood test on day 5 of the menstrual cycle. Clomiphene Citrate Challenge Test (CCCT) Measures FSH and estradiol before and after taking clomiphene citrate. Two blood tests: day 3 and day 10. Higher FSH levels on day 10 indicate lower reserve. Used for detailed functional assessment. Follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) on day 3 (Option A): Elevated levels of FSH on the third day of the menstrual cycle can indicate diminished ovarian reserve. However, FSH levels can fluctuate and be influenced by various factors, making it a less reliable single test. Estradiol on day 3 (Option B): Elevated estradiol levels on the third day of the menstrual cycle can suggest a diminished ovarian reserve. However, like FSH, estradiol levels can be variable and influenced by other factors. Serum inhibin levels on day 5 (Option D): Inhibin B levels can reflect the size and function of the ovarian follicle pool, but they can be more variable and less consistent than AMH.

It causes primary amenorrhea due to the obstruction of menstrual flow (cryptomenorrhea) and typically presents with cyclic abdominal pain and a bulging hymen. This is the correct karyotype to consider for further evaluation in this case. Incorrect Options: Option A - 46XY: This karyotype indicates a genetically male individual. Disorders of sexual development (DSD), such as Androgen Insensitivity Syndrome (AIS), may present with a female phenotype and amenorrhea but would not typically involve an imperforate hymen. Therefore, this is unlikely in the context of an imperforate hymen. Option C - 45XO: This karyotype is characteristic of Turner syndrome, a condition associated with primary amenorrhea and other clinical features such as short stature and ovarian dysgenesis. However, Turner syndrome would not be associated with an imperforate hymen, making this option less likely. Option D - 47XXY: This karyotype corresponds to Klinefelter syndrome, which is a condition affecting males. It typically presents with small testes, gynecomastia, and infertility, but not with primary amenorrhea or an imperforate hymen. Thus, this option is irrelevant in this context.",

The secondary oocyte is arrested in metaphase II and will only complete meiosis II if fertilization occurs. Incorrect Options: Option B - Secondary oocyte at the end of meiosis II: This option is incorrect because the secondary oocyte only completes meiosis II if it is fertilized by a sperm. Therefore, at ovulation, the oocyte is still in metaphase II, not at the end of meiosis II. Option C - Primary oocyte at the end of meiosis I: This option is incorrect because the primary oocyte completes meiosis I to form the secondary oocyte before ovulation. It is the secondary oocyte, not the primary oocyte, that is released during ovulation. Option D - Primary oocyte at the end of meiosis II: This option is incorrect because primary oocytes are arrested in prophase I until puberty.

Endometrial CA (Option A) : This is one of the most common causes of postmenopausal bleeding, accounting for approximately 10% of cases. Any postmenopausal bleeding must be evaluated to rule out endometrial cancer as it is often the first sign of the disease. Granulosa cell tumor (Option B) : This is an estrogen-producing ovarian tumor that can cause endometrial hyperplasia and subsequent bleeding. The excess estrogen production stimulates the endometrium, potentially leading to irregular bleeding even in postmenopausal women. Genital tract trauma (Option C) : While not as common as endometrial cancer, trauma to the genital tract can cause bleeding at any age. This may occur due to injury during intercourse, medical procedures, or other traumatic events to the genital area. Reference: Novak's Textbook of Gynecology, 16th Edition, Pages 389-392",

The bluish hue seen on physical examination is due to the blood collected behind the imperforate hymen. Incorrect Options: Option B - Transverse vaginal septum: A transverse vaginal septum is a horizontal wall of tissue that divides the vagina into upper and lower segments. This can cause obstruction of menstrual flow, leading to amenorrhea, but typically does not cause a suprapubic bulge or a visible bluish hue. Option C - Longitudinal vaginal septum: A longitudinal vaginal septum is a vertical partition within the vagina that results from incomplete fusion of the Müllerian ducts. It usually does not lead to amenorrhea, urinary retention, or a visible bluish hue. Option D - Lateral fusion defects: Lateral fusion defects refer to abnormalities in the fusion of the Müllerian ducts, leading to conditions such as uterine didelphys or bicornuate uterus.

      "explanation": "Correct Answer: A) Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS) Explanation: The clinical manifestations of the patient indicate Polycystic Ovarian Syndrome (PCOS). PCOS is the most common endocrine disorder among women of reproductive age. Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS), also known as Stein-Leventhal syndrome, is a heterogeneous, multisystem endocrinopathy in women of reproductive age with ovarian expression of various metabolic disturbances. Characteristic presentation includes: Irregular menstrual cycles Hirsutism (excessive hair growth) Acne Signs of insulin resistance Elevated serum testosterone levels PCOS is the leading cause of hirsutism in women. Endometriosis (Option B): Endometriosis primarily presents with dysmenorrhea, chronic pelvic pain, and infertility. The absence of these symptoms and presence of hyperandrogenism rules out this diagnosis. Additionally, endometriosis does not cause elevated testosterone or insulin resistance. Ovarian Tumor (Option C): While ovarian tumors can cause hormonal imbalances, they typically present with more acute onset of symptoms and often include pelvic pain or bloating. The chronic nature of symptoms and classic presentation of PCOS make this diagnosis less likely. Hypothyroidism (Option D): Hypothyroidism presents with fatigue, weight gain, cold intolerance, and often hair thinning rather than excessive hair growth. It does not cause elevated testosterone levels or the androgenic symptoms seen in this patient. Reference: Shaw's textbook of Gynaecology, Edition 17, Page 315",

Second degree The uterine body remains inside the vagina while the external os protrudes outside the vaginal introitus. Third degree (Procidentia) The cervix, uterine body, and fundus descend to lie outside the introitus. The complete uterus protrudes outside the vagina. LeFort Colpocleisis (Option A ) is a surgical procedure often used for older women who no longer desire vaginal intercourse. This procedure involves closing the vaginal canal partially to provide support for the prolapsed uterus. It is not suitable for young, nulliparous women who might want to preserve their fertility and sexual function. Fothergill operation (Option B) also known as the Manchester procedure, is a surgical technique that involves amputation of the cervix and suspension of the uterus. While it preserves the uterus, it may not be the best option for severe third-degree prolapse in a young woman, particularly if future pregnancy is a consideration. Shirodkar procedure (Option C) is typically used for cervical incompetence and involves the placement of a cervical cerclage to prevent preterm birth.

      "explanation": "Correct Answer A - OCP alone While OCPs are effective in regulating menstrual cycles and lowering androgen levels, OCPs alone may not be sufficient to fully address hirsutism, especially in cases where symptoms are more pronounced. Most clinical guidelines recommend a combination approach for managing hirsutism, integrating OCPs with antiandrogens or other supportive therapies to achieve better results. Combining OCPs with metformin (Option C) is effective, particularly for managing insulin resistance and menstrual irregularities, while also addressing hirsutism through the hormonal effects of oral contraceptives (OCPs) Combining OCP with antiandrogen medications (spironolactone) (Option B) is often recommended when OCPs alone do not sufficiently control hirsutism. Antiandrogens can block the effects of androgens, providing additional benefit Combining OCP and lifestyle modifications (Option D), including dietary changes, regular exercise, and weight management, are recommended as part of PCOS management. Weight reduction leads to ovulation [in 30% of cases]; loss of even 5-10% weight increases insulin sensitivity and can regularize cycles.

Ectopic pregnancy is a pregnancy that occurs outside of the uterus, typically in the fallopian tubes. A ruptured ectopic pregnancy can cause hemodynamic shock and requires immediate medical attention. Some common causes of ectopic pregnancy include: Pelvic Inflammatory Disease (PID) Endometriosis Scarring or damage to the fallopian tubes Previous abdominal or pelvic surgery Incorrect Options: Option A - Pyelonephritis: This is a type of kidney infection caused by bacteria that have entered the kidneys from the urinary tract. Symptoms may include fever, chills, nausea, vomiting, and pain in the back or side. While pyelonephritis can be associated with urinary tract symptoms, it is not typically associated with vaginal bleeding or a palpable mass in the lower abdomen. Option B - Gastrointestinal stromal tumor: This is a type of tumor that can develop in the digestive tract, usually in the stomach or small intestine. Symptoms may include abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, and gastrointestinal bleeding. Gastrointestinal stromal tumors are rare and not typically associated with vaginal bleeding or a palpable mass in the lower abdomen, making this option unlikely.

      "explanation": "Correct Answer: A) Condyloma accuminata Explanation: Condyloma acuminata, also known as anogenital warts, is a sexually transmitted infection caused by certain strains of the human papillomavirus (HPV). It commonly p resents as multiple warty growths on the vulva, perianal region, and other areas of the anogenital area. The warts may have a cauliflower-like appearance and can vary in size and number. Molluscum contagiosum (Option B) is a viral skin infection caused by the molluscum contagiosum virus (MCV). It typically presents as small, flesh-colored, dome-shaped bumps on the skin. While it can occur in the anogenital area, it is less commonly associated with warty lesions compared to condyloma acuminata. Chancroid (Option C) is a sexually transmitted infection caused by the bacteria Haemophilus ducreyi. It is characterized by painful genital ulcers or sores, rather than warty growths. Herpes (Option D) is a viral infection caused by the herpes simplex virus (HSV). It can manifest as genital ulcers or blisters, often accompanied by pain and itching.

      },
      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: C) Superficial inguinal lymph nodes Explanation: Superficial inguinal lymph nodes: Vulval cancer primarily drains lymph to the superficial inguinal lymph nodes, which are the first-echelon nodes. Sentinel node biopsy in vulval cancer targets these nodes to detect regional metastatic spread early, minimizing the need for extensive lymphadenectomy. Vulval cancer Age Group Most common in elderly women, especially in the 6th and 7th decades, (50-70 years age group) Risk Factors HPV infections, HSV infections, smoking, chronic immunosuppression, chronic inflammatory conditions (e.g., lichen sclerosis). Histological Type Squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) is the most common type. Common Sites Labia majora: Most common site (60%). Clitoris: Second most common site (15%). Presentation Exophytic (outward-growing) growth. Ulcerative lesions. Symptoms Pruritus (most common), often associated with an itch-scratch cycle. Swelling, lump, or ulcer. Cancer cachexia (weight loss and muscle wasting). Cancer pain (late symptom). Spread Primarily through the lymphatic system. Vulvar lymphatics cross midline, especially within 2 cm of the midline. Commonly involved lymph nodes: Inguinofemoral. Lymph node involvement significantly impacts prognosis. Investigations Excisional biopsy: Preferred for lesions < 1 cm, for histological assessment of invasion depth. Incisional biopsy: For lesions ≥ 1 cm. Wedge biopsy, Keyes punch biopsy, and sentinel lymph node biopsy (to assess inguinofemoral node involvement). Treatment Vulvectomy: Partial or total, depending on disease stage. Inguinal lymph node dissection: To evaluate disease spread. Sentinel lymph node biopsy (Superficial inguinal lymph nodes): Determines stage and prognosis. Pelvic lymph nodes (Option A) are involved in later stages of vulval cancer. They are not first-line nodes for sentinel biopsy. Cloquet node (Rosenmüller node) (Option B) is a deep inguinal node, located near the femoral canal, may be involved in advanced disease but is not routinely targeted in sentinel node biopsy. Deep inguinal lymph nodes (Option D) are Though involved in advanced vulval cancer, these nodes are downstream of the superficial inguinal nodes and are not sentinel nodes.

      "explanation": "Correct Answer: D) Ovarian carcinoma Explanation: Ovarian carcinoma is a common cause of adnexal masses in postmenopausal women. The patient’s history of hormone replacement therapy (HRT) and a non-tender right adnexal mass raise suspicion, as HRT may stimulate tumor growth and increase the risk of ovarian carcinoma in postmenopausal women. “ Nodular carcinoma of ovary” (Option A) is not a recognized medical term or specific diagnosis. It might be used to describe a solid tumor, but it is not a common or accurate term to describe ovarian malignancy. Ovarian carcinoma is the preferred and more precise diagnosis for malignant ovarian tumors in this context. A chocolate cyst (endometrioma) (Option B) is an ovarian cyst filled with old blood, typically associated with endometriosis. This condition is more common in premenopausal women. In postmenopausal women, especially those on HRT, ovarian carcinoma is more likely, as hormonal therapy can influence the growth of ovarian tumors. Ovarian fibroids (Option C) are not a recognized medical entity. Fibroids, or leiomyomas, are smooth muscle tumors that occur in the uterus, not the ovaries. A mass in the adnexa that is associated with a postmenopausal woman, especially with HRT use, is more consistent with ovarian carcinoma. Reference: Williams Gynaecology, 4th Edition, Page: 738-744.",

      "explanation": "vesicovaginal fistula (VVF) is a cystoscopy. A vesicovaginal fistula is an abnormal connection between the bladder and the vagina, leading to the passage of urine from the bladder into the vagina. To diagnose and evaluate a vesicovaginal fistula, a cystoscopy is typically performed. During a cystoscopy, a thin, flexible tube with a camera (cystoscope) is inserted through the urethra and into the bladder. This allows the healthcare provider to directly visualize the interior of the bladder and identify any abnormal openings or connections. Incorrect option: Option A . IVP (Intravenous Pyelogram): This option is incorrect. An IVP is an imaging test that involves injecting a contrast dye into the bloodstream to visualize the urinary tract, including the kidneys, ureters, and bladder. While an IVP can help detect abnormalities in the urinary system, it is not the investigation of choice for diagnosing a vesicovaginal fistula. Option C . 3 Swab Test: This option is Not correct. The \"3 Swab Test\" is a not diagnostic test for vesicovaginal fistula. OptionD . X-ray: This option is incorrect. X-rays are not the investigation of choice for diagnosing a vesicovaginal fistula.

      },
      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "\"getting your tubes tied,\" is a surgical procedure that permanently blocks or seals the fallopian tubes. It is considered an irreversible method of contraception because it creates a physical barrier that prevents sperm from reaching the egg, thus eliminating the possibility of fertilization and pregnancy. Once the fallopian tubes are ligated or blocked, it is generally not reversible, although some rare cases of successful tubal ligation reversal have been reported. Incorrect Option: Option B . Copper-T: Copper-T, also known as intrauterine device (IUD), is a long-acting reversible contraceptive method. It is a small T-shaped device that is inserted into the uterus to prevent pregnancy. Copper-T works by releasing copper ions, which create an environment that is toxic to sperm, thus preventing fertilization. While Copper-T provides long-term contraception, it is a reversible method. It can be removed at any time if the individual wishes to become pregnant. Option C . Implanon: Implanon, also known as a contraceptive implant, is a small rod-shaped device that is inserted under the skin of the upper arm. It releases a synthetic hormone called etonogestrel, which prevents ovulation and thickens cervical mucus, making it difficult for sperm to reach the egg. Implanon provides long-term contraception but is also reversible. It can be removed, and fertility can return to normal. Option D . LNG-IUD: LNG-IUD, or levonorgestrel-releasing intrauterine device, is another type of intrauterine device that releases a progestin hormone called levonorgestrel. It works by thickening cervical mucus, thinning the uterine lining, and inhibiting sperm movement. Like Copper-T and Implanon, LNG-IUD is a reversible method of contraception.

      "explanation": "critical role in the growth and development of the female reproductive system. It is responsible for thickening and maintaining the lining of the uterus, or endometrium, during the menstrual cycle. In postmenopausal women, the levels of estrogen decrease significantly, leading to thinning of the endometrium. However, if postmenopausal women take estrogen-only hormone therapy, it can stimulate the growth of the endometrial lining, which can increase the risk of endometrial cancer. This is because the constant exposure to estrogen can cause the endometrial cells to divide and multiply rapidly, leading to the development of abnormal cells that can become cancerous. Adding progesterone to the hormone therapy can counteract this effect by balancing the growth-promoting effects of estrogen on the endometrium. In postmenopausal women, progesterone can help to thin the endometrial lining and reduce the risk of endometrial cancer. Combined with estrogen, it is referred to as hormone replacement therapy (HRT). Incorrect Options: Combined oral contraceptive pills (Option A) : While combined oral contraceptive pills contain both estrogen and progestin, they are not typically used to reduce the risk of endometrial cancer in postmenopausal women as they have different concentrations of progesterone and estrogen. Clonidine (Option B): Clonidine is a medication used to treat high blood pressure but is not typically used to reduce the risk of endometrial cancer. Clonidine works by relaxing blood vessels, lowering blood pressure, and reducing the heart rate. Clonidine is not associated with any significant reduction in the risk of endometrial cancer Vitamin E (Option C): While vitamin E is an antioxidant that may have some health benefits. It is found in many foods, including nuts, seeds, fruits and vegetables, and is also available in supplement form. Vitamin E has not been shown to have a significant effect on the risk of endometrial cancer. Reference: https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6494585",

      "explanation": "receptor-positive breast cancer. While tamoxifen can be effective in reducing the risk of breast cancer recurrence, it does have the potential to increase the risk of certain other types of cancer. One of the most significant risks associated with tamoxifen use is an increased risk of endometrial cancer. This is because tamoxifen acts as an estrogen antagonist in the breast tissue but acts as an estrogen agonist in the uterus, which can lead to abnormal growth of the uterine lining. Incorrect Options: Option A: Ovarian cancer is a type of cancer that starts in the ovaries, which are the female reproductive organs that produce eggs. Tamoxifen use is not associated with an increased risk of ovarian cancer. However, women with a BRCA1 or BRCA2 gene mutation may be at increased risk for both ovarian and breast cancer, and tamoxifen use may be recommended as a preventive measure. Option C: Tamoxifen use is actually used to reduce the risk of breast cancer recurrence in the same breast or the opposite breast in women with hormone receptor-positive breast cancer. Women who have been diagnosed with breast cancer in one breast may be at increased risk for developing breast cancer in the other breast, and tamoxifen can help reduce that risk. Option D: Tamoxifen use is not associated with an increased risk of cervical cancer. However, regular cervical cancer screening is still important for all women, including those taking tamoxifen.",

This is called SUBNUCLEAR VACUOLATION which is the earliest sign of progesterone effect (appears within 36-48 hours) and persists till the 21st day of cycle. Glands become corkscrew shaped. Marked spiralling of blood vessels are seen. Thickness of the endometrium is highest. Incorrect Options: Option B - Proliferative phase: Starts from the 5th or 6th day till the 14 day. In this phase, there is rise in estrogen levels which makes the glands tubular, epithelium becomes columnar. Stromal cells become spindle shaped. Spiral vessels extend without giving out any branches below the epithelium. Option C - Menstrual phase: During this phase, there is a fall in the levels of estrogen and progesterone due to the regression of corpus luteum which result in the shedding of the endometrium prepared for a pregnancy.

Slowly it distends the vagina first, followed by the uterine cavity, and later it distends the fimbrial ends of the fallopian tubes. Imperforate hymen occurs due to the failure of disintegration of the central cells of Mullerian eminence. Vulval inspection may reveal a bluish bulging membrane. The diagnosis can be confirmed by ultrasonography. Incorrect Options: Option A - Bartholin: Bartholin glands two glands that are situated in the groove between the hymen and the labia minora. Infections involving the bartholin gland are usually polymicrobial. Bartholin abscess is associated with fever and unilateral painful swelling beneath the posterior half of labia majora. Bartholin cyst is a unilateral swelling on the posterior half of labia majora which contains glairy colourless fluid. Option B - Transverse vaginal septum: A thick band of fibrous tissue separates the vagina horizontally into 2 compartments. This produces symptoms similar to imperforate hymen.

Incorrect Options: Option A - Submucous fibroid: it produces maximum symptoms like menorrhagia, severe dysmenorrhoea, subfertility, pressure symptoms, recurrent miscarriage, preterm labor, abdominal enlargement.. Option B - Ovarian malignancy: Ovarian malignancy is seen more often in the postmenopausal age group and there is increased association with nulliparity. Symptoms are nonspecific, including abdominal distension, loss of appetite, pelvic pain. As the tumor grows in size, symptoms become more pronounced. On per vaginal examination, the uterus may be separated from the mass felt per abdomen. Ascites are often present due to obstruction in the flow of peritoneal fluid through the diaphragm. Right pleural effusion may also be present. Option C - Ectopic pregnancy: The fertilized ovum gets implanted and develops outside the normal endometrial cavity. It occurs between 20-30 years of age. If the diagnosis is ruptured ectopic, symptoms include a short period of amenorrhoea (around 6-8 weeks), colicky type of lower abdominal abdominal pain, vomiting. Features of shock like pallor, hypotension, cold clammy extremities may be observed. On abdominal examination, no mass is usually felt. Per vaginal examination may reveal extreme forniceal tenderness or tenderness on movement of the cervix.

In this case, the 16-year-old girl presenting with short height, amenorrhea (absence of menstrual periods), and widely spaced nipples suggests a potential chromosomal abnormality associated with primary ovarian insufficiency (POI) or Turner syndrome. Turner syndrome, also known as 45 XO syndrome, is a genetic condition that occurs in females who are missing all or part of one of their X chromosomes. The most common karyotype in Turner syndrome is 45 XO, indicating the presence of only one X chromosome instead of the normal two. The characteristic features of Turner syndrome include short stature, delayed or absent puberty (amenorrhea), and specific physical characteristics such as widely spaced nipples, webbed neck, and lymphedema (swelling due to lymphatic system abnormalities). Other associated findings may include infertility, cardiac abnormalities, renal anomalies, and learning difficulties. Incorrect Options: Option B: 46 XO: This karyotype does not exist. Humans typically have 46 chromosomes, and XO would imply the absence of a sex chromosome, which is not a viable combination. Option C: 47 XXX: This karyotype indicates the presence of an additional X chromosome in females, known as Triple X syndrome.

Laparoscopy is a surgical procedure that involves inserting a thin, lighted tube with a camera (laparoscope) through small incisions in the abdomen. It allows the doctor to examine the pelvic organs, including the fallopian tubes and ovaries, for any abnormalities such as blockages, adhesions, or endometriosis. In the case of bilateral cornual block, laparoscopy can help determine the cause of the blockage and assess the overall condition of the reproductive organs. Hysteroscopy is a procedure that involves inserting a thin, lighted tube (hysteroscope) through the cervix into the uterus. It allows the doctor to directly visualize the inside of the uterus and detect any abnormalities, such as uterine polyps, fibroids, or adhesions, which may contribute to infertility. By performing both laparoscopy and hysteroscopy, the doctor can assess the condition of both the fallopian tubes and the uterus simultaneously. This helps in identifying the specific cause of infertility and determining the most appropriate treatment options. Incorrect Options: Option A: IVF (In Vitro Fertilization): IVF is a treatment option for infertility, but it is not the next step in this case. Before proceeding with IVF, it is essential to identify the cause of infertility, and in this scenario, further diagnostic evaluation through laparoscopy and hysteroscopy is necessary. Option B: Tuboplasty: Tuboplasty is a surgical procedure to repair or reconstruct the fallopian tubes. While it may be a treatment option for certain cases of tubal blockage or damage, it is not the next step in this scenario. Further evaluation through laparoscopy and hysteroscopy is required to assess the extent and location of the blockage before determining the appropriate treatment approach. Option D: USG (Ultrasonography): Ultrasonography is a non-invasive imaging technique that can provide valuable information about the pelvic organs. While it can help detect some abnormalities, it is not sufficient to assess and diagnose the specific cause of bilateral cornual block. Laparoscopy and hysteroscopy are needed for a more detailed evaluation and direct visualization of the reproductive organs. Reference: .",

In a 55-year-old postmenopausal woman who is experiencing this degree of prolapse, vaginal hysterectomy with pelvic floor repair is the most appropriate treatment. Vaginal hysterectomy is the removal of the uterus through the vaginal route, which is commonly recommended in cases of uterine prolapse, especially when future childbearing is not a concern (e.g., in postmenopausal women). Pelvic floor repair (also called pelvic reconstructive surgery) involves repairing the weakened pelvic tissues that caused the prolapse. This may include procedures like anterior and posterior colporrhaphy (repair of the vaginal walls) and perineorrhaphy (repair of the perineum) to restore pelvic support. Incorrect Options: Option A - Fothergill Repair : This procedure is used for uterine prolapse but is typically performed in younger women who wish to preserve their uterus and maintain fertility. The cervix is amputated, and the uterosacral ligaments are attached to the cervical stump to provide support. In a 55-year-old woman, especially postmenopausal, fertility is not a concern, and uterine preservation is unnecessary. Therefore, vaginal hysterectomy is the more appropriate treatment. Option B - Sling Operation : A sling operation is also primarily used for stress urinary incontinence and involves the placement of a supportive sling around the urethra to improve urinary control. It is not the best management option for uterine prolapse alone. Option D - Shirodkar Procedure : The Shirodkar procedure is a surgical technique used for cervical incompetence and involves the placement of a permanent suture around the cervix to strengthen it and prevent premature opening.

In endometriosis, the endometrial tissue is primarily found outside the uterus, in areas such as the pelvic cavity or other ectopic sites, rather than within the deep myometrium (muscular layer of the uterus). Option C: Treated preferably with hysterectomy: Hysterectomy (removal of the uterus) is not the first-line treatment for endometriosis. The initial approach involves medical management, including pain management and hormonal therapies. Hysterectomy may be considered in severe cases or when other treatments have failed, but it is not the preferred treatment option. Option D: Seen in multiparous women: Endometriosis can occur in women regardless of their parity (number of pregnancies). It is not limited to multiparous women (women who have had multiple pregnancies).",

At 39 weeks, the benefits of delivery outweigh the risks of continuing the pregnancy, considering the potential for macrosomia (large birth weight) and associated birth complications in infants of mothers with GDM. Incorrect Options: Option A . 37 weeks: Delivery at 37 weeks is not the standard recommendation for women with well-controlled GDM. Early delivery at 37 weeks may be considered in cases of poorly controlled GDM or if there are other medical indications such as fetal growth restriction, preeclampsia, or concerns for fetal well-being. Option C . 38 weeks: Delivery at 38 weeks may be considered in certain cases, but 39 weeks is the preferred gestational age for delivery in women with well-controlled GDM. Option D . 40 weeks: Delivery at 40 weeks is not the standard recommendation for women with GDM. Prolonging the pregnancy beyond 39 weeks may increase the risk of complications such as macrosomia, shoulder dystocia, and cesarean delivery.",

      "explanation": "device (IUD), commonly known as Copper T, is generally safe and effective for most women.Women who have had an ectopic pregnancy are at a higher risk of having another ectopic pregnancy in the future. Therefore, inserting an IUD in a woman with a history of ectopic pregnancy can increase the risk of another ectopic pregnancy and its complications, making it an absolute contraindication. Incorrect Options: Option A - Unmotivated patient: A lack of motivation is not an absolute contraindication for IUD insertion. However, healthcare providers should ensure that the patient understands the benefits, risks, and proper usage of the IUD before insertion. Option B - Menorrhagia: Menorrhagia, which is heavy menstrual bleeding, is not an absolute contraindication for IUD insertion. In fact, copper IUDs are sometimes used to treat menorrhagia by reducing menstrual bleeding. Option D - Previous history of abortion: A previous history of abortion, especially if uncomplicated, is not an absolute contraindication for IUD insertion. In fact, IUD insertion can be done after a safe abortion procedure, providing effective contraception for the future. Reference: .",

      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "myomectomy fluids may be used to distend the uterus for visualization and manipulation. Fluid can escape into the peritoneal cavity or circulation and careful monitoring of fluids is essential during the procedure. The surgery can be continued in this instance as the deficit is 500ml and careful monitoring will be necessary. Incorrect Options: Option A - Stop the surgery: Stopping the surgery based solely on a 500ml deficit of the irrigating fluid may not be necessary, especially if the patient's vital signs and overall condition are stable. Option B - Change the fluid to normal saline: While changing the irrigating fluid to normal saline may be an option, it is not the immediate next step in this scenario. In some cases, glycine is preferred for its specific properties, such as maintaining a clear surgical field and minimizing thermal injury. Option D - Give furosemide to the patient and continue surgery: Furosemide is a diuretic medication used to increase urine output. Administering furosemide to address a fluid deficit during surgery may not be necessary or appropriate. Reference: .",

      },
      "correct_answer": "D",
      "explanation": "the presence of a 46XY karyotype (typically associated with males) in individuals who have female external genitalia at birth. It is caused by a mutation or deletion in the SRY gene, which is responsible for testicular development. In Swyer's syndrome, the gonads (testes) do not develop properly and are replaced by fibrous tissue, leading to primary amenorrhea and poor breast development. The internal reproductive structures, such as the uterus, may be present and appear normal. Incorrect Options: Option A - Androgen insensitivity syndrome: Androgen insensitivity syndrome (AIS) is a condition in which individuals with a 46XY karyotype have partial or complete insensitivity to androgens (male sex hormones). Option B - Turner syndrome: In Turner syndrome, the ovaries are usually underdeveloped or absent. However, the karyotype in Turner syndrome is 45X (45 chromosomes with a missing X chromosome), whereas the scenario describes a 46XY karyotype, ruling out Turner syndrome. Option C - True hermaphrodite: True hermaphrodites can have a variety of karyotypes, including 46XX, 46XY, or mosaic karyotypes. However, in the given scenario, gonads are not detected, which is not consistent with true hermaphroditism Reference: .",

Incorrect Option: Option A - Carcinoma vagina: SLN biopsy is less commonly used in Carcinoma vagina compared to other gynecological malignancies. Lymph node involvement in Carcinoma vagina varies, and SLN biopsy may not always be applicable or necessary. Option C - Carcinoma cervix: SLN biopsy is not routinely performed in Carcinoma cervix. The standard approach for assessing lymph node involvement in Carcinoma cervix is pelvic lymphadenectomy or systemic lymph node sampling. Option D - Carcinoma endometrium: SLN biopsy is not commonly performed in Carcinoma endometrium.

Estrogen helps to thicken the endometrium, promote the growth of the dominant follicle, and inhibit the release of FSH and LH via negative feedback mechanisms. This hormonal activity is crucial for preparing the endometrium for potential implantation and for the maturation of the follicle leading up to ovulation. Incorrect Options: Option A - FSH (Follicle-stimulating hormone): FSH is indeed important during the follicular phase as it stimulates the growth and maturation of ovarian follicles. However, it is secreted by the anterior pituitary gland, not the ovarian granulosa cells. Option C - LH (Luteinizing hormone): LH is also secreted by the anterior pituitary gland. LH levels surge just before ovulation, triggering the release of the mature egg from the dominant follicle. This surge marks the transition from the follicular phase to the ovulatory phase Option D - Progesterone: During the follicular phase, progesterone levels are relatively low. Progesterone production is primarily associated with the luteal phase, which occurs after ovulation. During the luteal phase, the corpus luteum forms and secretes progesterone to maintain the endometrium for a potential pregnancy. Reference: .",
