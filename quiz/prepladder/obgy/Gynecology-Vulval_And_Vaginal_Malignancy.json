      "explanation": "Correct Answer: B)Vulvar hamartoma Explanation: Vulvar Hamartoma: A vulvar hamartoma is a benign tumor-like growth that occurs on the vulva, which is the external part of the female genitalia. Hamartomas are made up of an abnormal mixture of tissue types that are normally found in the area but are disorganized and overgrown. Risk factors: HPV infection:(Option C) The most significant risk factor for vulvar carcinoma is infection with Human papilloma Virus (HPV), particularly high-risk serotypes such as HPV 16 & 18 (option C). 50-75% of invasive vulvar cancers are associated with high risk HPV infections. Smoking:(Option A) Women who smoke and have a history of HPV infection have a 35 fold greater risk of developing vulvar cancer. Vulvar Intraepithelial Neoplasia: VIN is a precancerous condition, of which 10% of cases progress into Vulvar cancer Chronic Immunosuppression: HIV infection and organ transplantation. Chronic dermatological conditions: (Option D) Lichen sclerosus:Differentiated VIN is a precursor to keratinizing squamous cellcarcinoma and is strongly associated with lichen sclerosus.

      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: C) Excisional biopsy Explanation: In the above scenario, in a post-menopausal woman, a vulvar lesion on the labia with persistent itching is most likely to be Squamous Cell Carcinoma of the vulva which is confirmed after biopsy. Squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) of the vulva Site Labia majora is the most common (60%). Clitoris 2nd most common (15%). Most common in 50-70 years age group Presentation Exophytic (outward-growing) and ulcerative (open sore) growth. Symptom Pruritus (most common): Often associated with an itch-scratch cycle. Cancer cachexia (weight loss and muscle wasting). Cancer pain. Spread Primarily spreads through the lymphatic system. Vulvar lymphatics cross over at the midline, especially within 2 cm of the midline. The inguinofemoral lymph nodes are the most commonly involved group. Lymph node involvement significantly affects prognosis. Investigations Excisional biopsy (IOC): For lesions < 1 cm in size. Complete lesion removal and histological assessment, including invasion presence and depth. (Option C) Incisional biopsy: For lesions ≥ 1 cm in size. (Option D) Wedge biopsy. Keyes punch biopsy. Sentinel lymph node biopsy: Assess lymph node involvement, particularly the inguinofemoral nodes. Vulvoscopy (Option A) is Limited to visual assessment; does not provide a definitive diagnosis. Colposcopy (Option B) A valuable tool for visualizing and identifying suspicious areas for biopsy. However, it is not a diagnostic procedure on its own.

      },
      "correct_answer": "D",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: D) Clinically suspicious groin lymph nodes. Explanation: Sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB): The sentinel lymph node is the first to receive lymphatic drainage from a tumour. Sentinel lymph node biopsy involves inguinofemoral nodes ( Superficial inguinal lymph nodes) using Technetium 99 or isosulphan blue dye. Positive sentinel node: Radical lymphadenectomy. Negative sentinel node: Only vulvectomy needed. B/l inguinofemoral nodes are dissected for SLNB (if mass lies within 2 cm of the midline) Prognostic significance: Without groin node metastasis: >90% 5-year survival rate. With groin node metastasis: 50% 5-year survival rate. Indications of SLNB: Unifocal tumors confined to the vulva. Tumors <4 cm in diameter. Stromal invasion >1 mm. (Option C) Clinically and radiologically negative groin nodes. Contraindication of SLNB: SLNB is not performed if there is clinical suspicion of groin node metastasis because the goal of SLNB is to determine if the cancer has spread to the lymph nodes. If there is already clinical suspicion of metastasis, a more extensive inguinofemoral lymphadenectomy is typically performed. Options A and B: The decision to perform SLNB is based on factors such as tumor location, size, invasion depth, and clinical suspicion of lymph node metastasis.

      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: A) Radical vulvectomy with bilateral inguinofemoral lymphadenectomy Treatment of Tumor Stages of Vulval Cancer Stage 1 1a (Option B) Wide local excision with a 1-cm margin is performed for the probable cure. 1b Radical resection of the primary tumor and inguinofemoral lymphadenectomy (LAD). Central lesion: B/L LAD Lateral lesion (> 2 cm from midline): U/L LAD. Stage II Radical vulvectomy + B/L LAD Positive LN involvement in HPE - Must do pelvic LAD or pelvic LN radiotherapy. Stage III Radical partial or total vulvectomy and either SLNB or inguinofemoral lymphadenectomy. Postoperative adjuvant radiation (4000-5000 Rads over 5 weeks) directed to both the groins and the pelvis. Stage IV Treated with chemotherapy or radiotherapy Chemotherapy: 5-FU, mitomycin C Other agents used are Methotrexate, bleomycin, and trastuzumab. Option C: Chemoradiation therapy alone is typically reserved for patients who cannot undergo surgery due to medical comorbidities or in cases where the tumor is not resectable and incase of distant metastasis Option D: Simple vulvectomy alone does not adequately address the potential risk of lymph node metastasis. SLNB is important to rule out microscopic lymph node involvement, even in the early stages. Reference: William’s Textbook of Gynaecology, 4th edition, pages 684,685, 686, 687",

(Option C) IVA Tumor invades bladder and/or rectal mucosa and/or direct extension beyond the true pelvis. (Option D) IVB Spread to distant organs. Management of VAIN: Observation : For low-grade lesions, especially in younger or postmenopausal women without symptoms. Involves repeat colposcopy and biopsy. Wide Excision: Involves surgically removing the VAIN lesion along with a margin of healthy tissue. This serves as a definitive treatment and is often the preferred approach for high-grade VAIN. Laser ablation : For localized high-grade lesions. Topical Treatments: Application of 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) cream, Imiquimod (5%), Dinitrochlorobenzene for high-grade lesions. Follow-up : Regular surveillance with Pap smears and colposcopy to monitor for progression or recurrence. Reference: William’s Textbook of Gynaecology, 4th Edition, pages 691, 692",

Symptoms: Erythematous chronic skin lesions associated with pruritus, burning and pain. Multifocal well-demarcated velvety erythematous plaques, more commonly seen on labia majora. Biopsy of the lesion shows paget’s cells (large cells with abundant cytoplasm) in the epithelium Treatment Non-invasive disease: lesions are resected by wide local excision with 1-2 cm margin. Invasive disease: Radical partial vulvectomy with/without inguinofemoral lymphadenectomy. Option A: Lichen sclerosus is a chronic dermatological condition seen in prepubertal girls and postmenopausal women. Porcelain white plaques are seen in lichen sclerosus. Option C: Vulvar candidiasis is a gynecological infection commonly seen in immunosuppressed or diabetic patients. Curdy white discharge is usually seen. Option D: Bowen’s disease, a precancerous condition that may progress into invasive squamous cell carcinoma, is characterized by tender, erythematous epidermal lesion with induration. Reference: 1.

      "question": "A 62-year-old woman presents with complaints of persistent vulvar itching and a non-healing lesion on her vulva. On PE, a thickened, whitish plaque and ulceration are noted on the labia majora. Histopathology reveals atypical squamous cells confined to the epithelium with marked basal atypia and abnormal keratinisation as shown below. Which of the following is the patient suffering from?",

      "correct_answer": "D",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: D) Differentiated VIN Explanation: Classification of Vulval Intraepithelial Neoplasia: Normal vulva Lined by stratified squamous epithelium Vulvar LSIL Seen in younger women (option B) Etiology: HPV effect Flat lesions with condyloma Self limited, not precancerous Histology: Mild atypical cells in the lower third of epithelium Koilocytes in the upper layer Vulval HSIL Formerly called usual VIN (option A&C) Seen in younger women Etiology: HPV infection, STDs, immunosuppression, smoking Multicentric & multifocal disease Precancerous condition Histology: Atypical squamous cells in all layers of epithelium Extensive parakeratosis Koilocytic changes in the upper layer. Differentiated VIN Seen in older, postmenopausal women (option D) Etiology: Lichen sclerosus and other chronic dermatological conditions Unicentric and unifocal disease Precancerous condition Histology: Prominent nucleoli Basal atypia with acanthosis, dyskeratosis Investigations: Lesions are usually sharply demarcated. In usual VIN, lesions appear bulky, resembling condylomata and are multifocal. In differentiated VIN, lesions are unifocal and may be associated with inflammatory dermatitis such as lichen sclerosus. Vulvoscopy: Vulvar epithelial changes are observed after application of acetic acid and the most abnormal appearing areas are biopsied. Treatment: Vulvar LSIL Self-limited condition. Not treated unless symptomatic. Vulvar HSIL and differentiated VIN Precancerous conditions. All lesions should be treated. Treatment options: Wide local excision Laser ablation Topical 5-FU or imiquimod",
