Echocardiography is an expensive investigation not routinely recommended for all pregnant women but is indicated in specific conditions such as: Abnormal genetic screening results (e.g., increased nuchal translucency >3 mm), requiring detailed ultrasound and fetal echocardiography. Gestational diabetes mellitus, for early detection of fetal anomalies, typically performed at 20-22 weeks. Maternal heart disease (e.g., congenital heart disease, Marfan's syndrome), to assess structural abnormalities or valve anatomy. Routine Investigations During Pregnancy: Trimester Investigations First Trimester Hemoglobin and hematocrit Blood grouping and Rh typing Blood glucose testing VDRL testing Midstream urine analysis (protein, sugar, nitrites) Serology for rubella, hepatitis B, and HIV Maternal serum alpha-fetoprotein (optional) Ultrasound (Dating Scan): Confirms gestational age, fetal viability, and number of fetuses Pap smear (if not done within the last year) Second Trimester Ultrasound (Anomaly Scan, 18–20 weeks): Assesses fetal anatomy, structural abnormalities, amniotic fluid index, and placental location Oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT, 24–28 weeks) Repeat urine analysis Quadruple marker screening (optional) Antibody screening (for Rh-negative mothers) Ultrasound (Fetal Echocardiography, if indicated): Detailed evaluation of fetal heart for congenital anomalies Third Trimester Repeat hemoglobin and hematocrit Repeat serology for syphilis, HIV, and hepatitis B Vaginal and rectal swab for Group B Streptococcus (GBS) testing (35–37 weeks) Ultrasound (Growth Scan): Monitors fetal growth, amniotic fluid levels, and placental function Non-stress test (NST) or biophysical profile (BPP, if indicated) Coagulation profile (if indicated) Ultrasound (Doppler Scan, if indicated): Evaluates placental and fetal blood flow in conditions like IUGR or preeclampsia Reference: Williams Obstetrics, 26th Edition, Page: 178.

      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: C) Extraplacental membranes and 2-vesseled umbilical cord present Explanation: Extraplacental membranes refer to the amnion and chorion, which are normal components A 2-vessel umbilical cord (1 artery and 1 vein) is considered abnormal and is associated with conditions like fetal anomalies or growth restriction. The normal umbilical cord contains 3 vessels: 2 arteries and 1 vein. General Characteristics of the Placenta The placenta is a crucial organ in pregnancy, facilitating nutrient, gas, and waste exchange between the mother and fetus. Shape and Size Shape : Discoid, typically round to oval in shape. Diameter : At term, the placenta measures approximately 22 cm in diameter. (Option B ruled out) Thickness : The central thickness of the placenta at term is around 2.5 cm . (Option D ruled out) Weight : The placenta weighs about 470 g at term. (Option A ruled out) Structure 1. Chorionic Plate : Found on the fetal surface. Lined by the amniotic membrane. The umbilical cord attaches to this surface. 2. Basal Plate : Located on the maternal surface. Faces the uterine wall. Divided into segments called cotyledons , which are functional units of the placenta. 3. Extraplacental Membranes : Includes the amnion and chorion, which protect and enclose the fetus. 4. Umbilical Cord : Normally, it consists of three vessels : two arteries and one vein. A two-vessel cord is abnormal and may indicate congenital anomalies or placental insufficiency. Physiological Features Deciduate : The placenta, along with the fetal membranes, is shed during delivery. Hemochorial : Maternal blood directly contacts fetal trophoblast cells to enable efficient substance exchange. Reference: Williams Obstetrics, 26th Edition, Page: 108.",

        "D": "Crown-rump length is the best measure of period of gestation in the first trimester"
      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: B) Calculated from the last day of the last menstrual period Explanation: The period of gestation (POG) is typically calculated from the first day of the last menstrual period (LMP), not the last day. Naegele’s Rule Naegele's Rule is a standard method used to calculate the Estimated Date of Delivery (EDD) for a pregnant woman based on her Last Menstrual Period (LMP). It assumes a typical pregnancy duration of 280 days (40 weeks) from the first day of the LMP. Steps to Calculate EDD Using Naegele's Rule: Identify the first day of the Last Menstrual Period (LMP). Add 9 months to this date or Subtract 3 months. Add 7 days to the result. This calculation works well for women with regular menstrual cycles of 28 days. Adjustments may be needed for women with irregular cycles. Example: If the LMP is March 10, 2024: Add 9 months: December 10, 2024. Add 7 days: December 17, 2024. The EDD is December 17, 2024. Options A, C and D are true. Option A: Ultrasound in the first trimester, especially measuring the crown-rump length (CRL), is one of the best and most accurate methods for determining gestational age during early pregnancy, typically between 7 to 12 weeks. Option C: In IVF pregnancies, the day of embryo transfer or fertilization is crucial for calculating the period of gestation (POG), as the exact date of conception is known. Option D: Crown-rump length (CRL) is the most reliable and accurate measuremen t of gestational age in the first trimester, especially between 7 to 12 weeks, as it directly reflects the fetus's size during early.

      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: B) 32 weeks of gestation Explanation: In a healthy pregnancy, the amniotic fluid index (AFI) typically reaches its highest value around 32 to 34 weeks of gestation. After this period, the amniotic fluid volume might start to gradually decrease as the pregnancy progresses toward full term. AFI is an important measurement during ultrasound examinations, as it helps assess the amount of amniotic fluid surrounding the fetus.

      "explanation": "Correct Answer: D) 10 days postpartum Explanation: Cardiac output increases during pregnancy to meet the increased demands of the growing fetus and maternal physiological changes. After delivery, it takes some time for cardiac output to return back to pre-pregnant levels . The timeframe for cardiac output to return to pre-pregnant levels varies among individuals but generally occurs within 10 days postpartum. Several factors influence the age at which cardiac output normalizes, including the individual's overall health, fitness level, and any complications experienced during pregnancy or childbirth.

        "D": "4 mg/day"
      },
      "correct_answer": "D",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: D) 4 mg/day Explanation: For women who have a history of a pregnancy complicated by a neural tube defect (NTD), the recommended dose of folic acid is higher than the standard prenatal recommendation. The standard daily recommendation for folic acid in pregnancy is 400 micrograms (mcg) per day. However, in cases where there is a history of a previous pregnancy affected by NTD, the recommended dose of folic acid is typically higher, usually around 4,000 micrograms (4 milligrams) per day. This higher dosage is prescribed to help reduce the risk of recurrence of NTDs in future pregnancies. 400 mcg/day (Option A): This is the standard recommended dose of folic acid for most women of childbearing age who are planning a pregnancy. However, for women with a history of an NTD-affected pregnancy, a higher dose is recommended to provide additional protection. 1 mg/day (Option B) & 2 mg/day (Option C): While this is a higher dose compared to the standard recommendation, it is still lower than the recommended dose for women with a history of an NTD-affected pregnancy. The specific recommendation in this case is a higher dose of 4 mg/day. Reference: Williams Textbook of Obstetrics, 25th Edition, Pages 180-182",

        "D": "This is a uterine contraction graph."
      },
      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: A) This is a non-stress test. Explanation: The given graph, showing only the tracing for the fetal heart rate (FHR), indicates a non-stress test (NST). Non-Stress Test (NST): It is a non-invasive test used to assess fetal well-being by monitoring the fetal heart rate and its response to fetal movements. It is typically performed in the third trimester of pregnancy. The mother is placed in a semi-reclining position, and two belts are placed around her abdomen to measure the fetal heart rate and detect fetal movements. Indications for NST: Post-term pregnancy. Decreased fetal movements. High-risk pregnancies (e.g., hypertension, diabetes). History of previous pregnancy complications. Suspected intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR). Primary parameters evaluated during an NST: 1. Baseline Fetal Heart Rate (FHR) 2. Beat-to-beat Variability: Normal: 110-160 bpm Bradycardia: less than 110 bpm. Tachycardia: more than 160 bpm. Fluctuations in the heart rate from one beat to the next. Amplitude range of 6-25 bpm (considered normal). 3. Accelerations Temporary increases in FHR above the baseline. Reactive NST: At least two accelerations in a 20-minute period. Each acceleration should be 15 bpm above the baseline and last for at least 15 seconds (for fetuses older than 32 weeks). Non-Reactive NST: Fewer than two accelerations in a 20-minute period. 4. Decelerations Temporary drops in FHR below the baseline. Early Decelerations: Usually benign, occurring with uterine contractions. Variable Decelerations: Can indicate umbilical cord compression. Late Decelerations: Concerning as they may indicate uteroplacental insufficiency. 5. Fetal Movements The presence and frequency of fetal movements are monitored, as decreased movements can indicate distress. Interpretation: Reactive NST: Indicative of normal fetal oxygenation and autonomic function. Non-Reactive NST may require further testing, such as a Biophysical Profile (BPP) or Contraction Stress Test (CST). The baseline shows that the fetus has tachycardia (Option B): Tachycardia is defined as a baseline fetal heart rate above 160 beats per minute. The tracing in this graph shows a baseline fetal heart rate below 160 bpm, so tachycardia is not present. The beat-to-beat variability is less/inadequate (Option C): Beat-to-beat variability refers to the fluctuations in the baseline fetal heart rate, excluding accelerations and decelerations. A variability of 6-25 beats/min is considered normal. This graph shows normal beat-to-beat variability, and thus, this option is incorrect. This is a uterine contraction graph (Option D): This graph shows only fetal heart rate tracing and does not include any data on uterine contractions.

      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: C) G2P1 Explanation: The correct obstetric score is G2P1 , as she is in her second pregnancy (G2), and her previous twin delivery counts as one parity (P1), regardless of the number of babies born. The obstetric score includes: Gravida Denotes a pregnant state, both present and past, irrespective of the period of gestation Parity Denotes a state of previous pregnancy beyond the period of viability(28 weeks) Abortion Number of pregnancies lost before 24 weeks Living Number of living children Note: Twin pregnancy counts as one for both gravida and parity. G2P2 (Option A) : This implies two pregnancies with two full-term deliveries, but her previous twin delivery counts as one parity (P1), and this is her second pregnancy (G2).

      },
      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: A) Crown-rump length by USG Explanation: Ultrasound measurement of the crown-rump length (CRL) is the most accurate method to assess gestational age in early pregnancy. Gestational Age Determination: Based on the woman's Last Menstrual Period (LMP) and ultrasound measurements of the embryo or fetus. Gestational age is calculated from the first day of the LMP, usually in weeks. If LMP is uncertain or there is a discrepancy between LMP and ultrasound, ultrasound measurements determine the Estimated Due Date (EDD). Ultrasound parameters for estimation of the gestational age: Crown-Rump Length (CRL): Most accurate before 14 weeks gestation. Accuracy is within 5-7 days. After 14 weeks gestation: Additional measurements like biparietal diameter (BPD), head circumference (HC), abdominal circumference (AC), and femur length (FL) are used for gestational age and fetal weight estimation. Gestational Age Parameter Threshold Value to Redate <9 weeks CRL >5 days 9 to <14 weeks CRL >7 days 14 to <16 weeks BPD, HC, AC, FL >7 days 16 to <22 weeks BPD, HC, AC, FL >10 days 22 to <28 weeks BPD, HC, AC, FL >14 days ≥ 28 weeks BPD, HC, AC, FL >21 days Adding 280 days to the LMP (Option B): This method assumes a pregnancy lasts 280 days (40 weeks) from the first day of the last menstrual period (LMP). However, it may not be accurate for women with irregular cycles, as variations in cycle length and ovulation timing can affect gestational age calculation. Fundus examination (Option C): This method estimates gestational age by palpating the top of the uterus to assess the height of the uterine fundus above the pubic symphysis. It is less accurate than ultrasound and can be influenced by factors like maternal weight and fetal position. Adding 256 days to the LMP (Option D): Similar to Option B, this method assumes a fixed duration of pregnancy but with a shorter duration of 256 days. However, it is not a commonly used or recommended method for estimating gestational age. Reference: Williams Obstetrics, 26th Edition, Page 247,248",

      },
      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: C) Fibrinogen Explanation: Fibrinogen is an acute-phase reactant, which means its levels increase in response to inflammation. During pregnancy, hormonal changes lead to increased levels of fibrinogen, resulting in an elevated ESR. This increase in fibrinogen is a normal physiological response and helps prepare the body for potential bleeding during childbirth. During pregnancy, an increase in erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) is a common finding. ESR is a non-specific indicator of inflammation and reflects the rate at which red blood cells settle in a vertical tube over a specific time period. It is influenced by several factors, including changes in blood composition and hormonal fluctuations during pregnancy. While albumin (Option A) is an important plasma protein involved in maintaining oncotic pressure and transporting various substances, changes in its levels during pregnancy don't have a major impact on ESR. Platelets (Option B) are essential for blood clotting, but they do not significantly affect ESR. Their count may change during pregnancy, but they don't cause a rise in ESR. Anti-thrombin antibodies (Option D) affect the anticoagulant function of anti-thrombin III but are not associated with increased ESR during pregnancy. The rise in ESR is primarily linked to increased acute-phase proteins like fibrinogen. Reference: Williams Obstetrics, 26th Edition, Page 61",

The contraction stress test assesses the response of the fetal heart rate to contractions induced by administering oxytocin or nipple stimulation. It is used to evaluate the fetal response to stress and to assess placental function. Fetal movement (Option A) assesses the presence and quantity of fetal movements. It involves observing the fetus's body or limb movements within a specific time period. Fetal breathing (Option B) evaluates the presence of rhythmic fetal breathing movements. It assesses the movement of the fetal diaphragm and helps determine fetal lung maturity. The Non-Stress Test (NST) (Option C) measures the fetal heart rate in response to fetal movement. It assesses the reactivity and accelerations in the fetal heart rate, which indicates a healthy and responsive fetus. Reference: Williams Obstetrics, 26th Edition, Page 389",

      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: B) G2P1 Explanation: G2P1 indicates that the woman has had two pregnancies (gravida 2) and one delivery (para 1). This option correctly accounts for the given history of a normal twin delivery at term 4 years ago. Gravida refers to the total number of pregnancies a woman has had, including the current pregnancy. Para refers to the number of pregnancies that have reached 20 weeks or more, regardless of the outcome (whether the pregnancies resulted in live births, stillbirths, or abortions). Incorrect Options: G2P2 (Option A) implies that the woman has had two pregnancies (gravida 2) and two deliveries (para 2). However, the given history states that she had a normal twin delivery at term 4 years ago , which counts as one pregnancy (gravida 1) and one delivery (para 1). Therefore, this choice is incorrect. G3P2 (Option C) would imply that the woman has had three pregnancies (gravida 3) and two deliveries (para 2). However, the given history only mentions one previous delivery , so this choice does not accurately represent the woman's history. Therefore, this choice is incorrect. G3P1 (Option D) suggests that the woman has had three pregnancies (gravida 3) and one delivery (para 1). Again, this option overestimates the number of pregnancies the woman has had based on the given history. Thus, this choice is also incorrect.

      },
      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: C) Chronic respiratory alkalosis Explanation: Respiratory alkalosis occurs when there is a decrease in CO2 levels in the blood due to hyperventilation, leading to an elevated pH. Chronic respiratory alkalosis indicates that this process has been ongoing for some time, allowing for partial renal compensation (reduction in bicarbonate). ABG features in pregnancy: pH: Slightly elevated (due to reduced CO2). CO2: Decreased (due to hyperventilation from progesterone). Bicarbonate: Slightly reduced (compensatory renal response). ABG Pattern: Mild respiratory alkalosis with partial compensation (reduced bicarbonate). During pregnancy, women often experience mild hyperventilation due to increased progesterone levels, leading to reduced CO2 and a slightly elevated pH. The body partially compensates over time, but the primary abnormality remains respiratory in nature. Acute metabolic acidosis (Option A) is characterized by a decrease in blood pH due to an accumulation of acids (like lactic acid) or a loss of bicarbonate. Acute metabolic alkalosis (Option B) is characterized by an increase in blood pH due to an excess of bicarbonate or a loss of hydrogen ions (e.g., from vomiting).

        "D": "Hyperglycaemia"
      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: B) Hyperthyroidism Explanation: The patient's symptoms, including weakness, amenorrhea, fatigue, poor appetite, and a low BMI (indicative of possible weight loss), suggest hyperthyroidism. This condition occurs due to excessive thyroid hormone production, leading to increased metabolic rates and symptoms such as weight loss, fatigue, and amenorrhea. The constant worry about weight gain may also indicate an underlying thyroid imbalance, as hyperthyroidism can cause disturbances in mood and appetite. Hypocholesterolaemia (Option A) is not typically associated with hyperthyroidism. Hyperthyroidism is more likely to cause a reduction in cholesterol levels due to increased metabolism, but it is not a prominent laboratory finding in this case. Hypersecretion of corticotropin-releasing hormone (Option C) is more related to conditions like Cushing's syndrome, which involves excess cortisol production. The symptoms described in this case do not align with those of Cushing's syndrome. Hyperglycaemia (Option D) is not a typical characteristic of hyperthyroidism. In fact, the increased metabolism in hyperthyroidism may lead to more glucose utilization, which could potentially result in hypoglycemia rather than hyperglycemia.

      },
      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer A - Gonads are bipotential at 8 weeks of gestational age The gonads are bipotential only till 6th week post-fertilization. Before 7 weeks of embryonic development, embryos of male and female sex cannot be differentiated. Gonads originate from the genital ridge, which develops in 4th-week post-fertilization. This remains undifferentiated and can form the ovary or testis, called the bipotential stage. This stage remains till the 6th week post-fertilization. During this time, the coelomic epithelium is formed from the genital ridge. The epithelium proliferates and invaginates into the mesenchyme to form the primitive sex cords. In males, the SRY gene on the Y chromosome triggers the development of testes, accompanied by the formation of Sertoli cells and Leydig cells. Leydig cells secrete testosterone, a hormone crucial for sexual differentiation. Through the action of 5-alpha reductase, testosterone is converted into dihydrotestosterone (DHT) , a more potent form. Testosterone guides the differentiation of the Wolffian duct for the internal male genitalia, while DHT is instrumental in the development of the male external genitalia (Option B) . Sertoli cells produce anti-Müllerian hormone (AMH), also known as Müllerian inhibiting substance (MIS) , which halts the development of the Müllerian system (Option C) comprising the uterus, fallopian tubes, and vagina. Testosterone guides the differentiation of the Wolffian duct for the internal male genitalia (Option D) , while DHT is instrumental in the development of the male external genitalia.

      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: B) Observe Explanation: The clinical manifestations indicate a normal labor progression in a primigravida requiring observation only. The cervical dilation of 6 cm after 6 hours of contractions represents an appropriate rate of dilation (approximately 1 cm/hour), which is within normal limits for a primigravida. The fetal heart rate of 150 bpm is reassuring, and the presence of good uterine contractions indicates effective labor progress. The fetal station at -2 with absent membranes suggests normal descent and spontaneous rupture of membranes, all of which are favorable signs in active labor. Emergency C-section (Option A): No indications for emergency cesarean section as both maternal and fetal parameters are normal. There is no fetal distress or arrest of labor. Emergency C-section would be indicated for non-reassuring fetal status or other obstetric emergencies. Start oxytocin (Option C): With good uterine contractions and normal labor progression, augmentation with oxytocin is not indicated. Unnecessary use of oxytocin could lead to uterine hyperstimulation and fetal compromise. Rupture of membranes and confirm cord prolapse (Option D): The membranes are already noted to be absent, making this intervention inappropriate. Additionally, deliberately checking for cord prolapse without indication could introduce infection risk. Reference: Williams Textbook of Obstetrics, 25th Edition, Pages 433-435",

      "correct_answer": "D",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: D) Intervention to be done Explanation: Patient is in active stage of labor (cervix 5 cm dilated) In 3 hours, cervical dilation increased only 1 cm, indicating poor progress, which requires management steps. Normal rate of cervical dilation in active labor is 1 cm/hour and descent is 1cm/hour Management Principles: If there is poor contraction and poor progress of labor, oxytocin is administered If there are good contractions and poor progress of labor, cesarean section is advised Slow progress of labor (Option A): This represents a diagnosis rather than a management plan. Simply identifying slow progress without implementing appropriate interventions does not address the underlying problem and may lead to prolonged labor with associated risks. Wait for complete dilation (Option B): Expectant management is inappropriate when labor progression falls below accepted standards. Prolonged labor increases risks of maternal exhaustion, fetal distress, and other complications. Active intervention is necessary to prevent adverse outcomes. Induce labor (Option C): Induction of labor is contraindicated as the patient is already in the active phase. Using induction agents in active labor could lead to uterine hyperstimulation and fetal compromise. The appropriate intervention would be either augmentation with oxytocin if contractions are inadequate, or consideration of cesarean delivery if cephalopelvic disproportion is suspected.

      "correct_answer": "D",
      "explanation": "Correct answer: D) Both options A & B Explanation: Physiology of increased blood volume in pregnancy The blood volume expands rapidly, reaching its maximum of 40–50% above the nonpregnant level at 30–34 weeks, ensuring an adequate supply of nutrients and oxygen to support the developing fetus and maternal physiological changes during pregnancy. Role of aldosterone and estrogen: The increase in blood volume is associated with enhanced sodium (Na) retention driven by hormonal changes like increased aldosterone levels during pregnancy. There is an increased demand for blood flow to support the growing fetus and maternal tissues during pregnancy. The increased aldosterone production promotes the reabsorption of sodium and water in the distal tubules and collecting ducts, enhances GFR, contributing to the expansion of blood volume. Estrogen levels rise significantly during pregnancy. First detectable at 9 weeks (0.05 ng/ml) and increases gradually to about 30 ng/ml at term. Estrogen plays a role in upregulating the Renin-Angiotensin-Aldosterone System (RAAS) , further influencing sodium and water retention in the kidneys. Aldosterone (Option C) , as mentioned earlier, enhances sodium and water retention. However, with an increased production of ADH during pregnancy, plasma levels remain unchanged due to increased metabolic clearance by placental vasopressinase, limiting its impact on the increase in blood volume during pregnancy.

      "question": "A 27-year-old pregnant G3P2L2 woman presents at 36+6 weeks. The ultrasound shows the fetus in a transverse lie. The liquor is adequate, the placenta is normal, and she has no risk factors. Both her previous delivery were normal vaginal deliveries. How will you manage this patient?",

        "C": "Expectant management",
        "D": "Induction of labour"
      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer B - External cephalic version In the given scenario, the pregnant woman presents at 36+6 weeks with a transverse lie and an external cephalic version could be the appropriate next step in management to attempt to reposition the fetus for a potential vaginal delivery. Management of transverse lie Antenatal management: If there are no contraindications, attempt an external cephalic version (ECV) beyond 35 weeks for the transverse lie. If Version Fails or is contraindicated: Elective cesarean section is the preferred delivery method. Management in labor : In early labour, try an external cephalic version (ECV) if appropriate or opt for cesarean section if ECV is unsuccessful. In late labour, ECV is usually impractical due to ruptured membranes, so cesarean section is preferred in such cases. Internal version considerations: Only for specific cases like managing the second twin. Cesarean section (Option A) is a surgical procedure in which the baby is delivered through an incision in the mother's abdomen and uterus. While a transverse lie is an indication of cesarean section, it is not the first-line management option in this scenario. If possible, non-invasive and conservative approaches are preferred before resorting to surgery. Expectant management (Option C) involves closely monitoring the patient and waiting for spontaneous changes in the fetal position or the onset of labour. However, in the case of a transverse lie at term, expectant management is not recommended due to the increased risk of cord prolapse and potential complications during delivery. Induction of labour (Option D): The fetal head is not engaged in the pelvis, which means the baby is not in a favourable position for a safe vaginal delivery. Attempting induction could increase the risk of complications such as cord prolapse or obstruction. Reference: Williams Gynecology, 4th edition, Page: 441, 442.",

      "question": "A woman presents to you at 36 weeks of gestation with complaints of feeling lightheadedness and dizziness when she lies on her back. She says she feels alright if she lies on her side or when she walks. What is the most likely reason behind this?",
      "options": {
        "A": "Increased intracranial pressure",
        "B": "IVC compression (IVC- Inferior Vena Cava)",
        "C": "Heavy meals",
        "D": "Excessive venous pooling at the feet"
      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: B) IVC compression (IVC- Inferior Vena Cava) The symptoms of shortness of breath due to lying on her back imply a decreased cardiac output. It usually occurs in pregnant women due to compression of the inferior vena cava and aorta by the gravid uterus when lying in the supine position and is called supine hypotensive syndrome. It leads to reduced venous return, decreased cardiac output, and hypotension. It causes nausea, dizziness and shortness of breath. This condition is relieved by shifting to a left lateral position. Increased intracranial pressure (Option A) : The fact that the woman feels fine when lying on her side or walking suggests that it helps alleviate the pressure on the IVC and improves blood flow to the heart and brain. This position promotes better circulation and reduces the risk of increased intracranial pressure and associated symptoms. Although increased intracranial pressure can cause this condition, it is less likely than IVC compression. While heavy meals (Option C) can cause postprandial hypotension (a drop in blood pressure after eating), the woman's symptoms are specifically associated with lying on her back, indicating a different underlying cause. Excessive venous pooling at the feet (Option D) , such as in cases of dependent oedema, is unlikely to cause lightheadedness and dizziness, specifically when lying on the back.

Glomerular Filtration Rate (GFR) During Pregnancy: (Option A) Increases by 25% by the second week of pregnancy and by 50% in the first trimester. Elevated GFR persists until term despite a decline in renal plasma flow in late pregnancy. Serum Creatinine During Pregnancy: Normal nonpregnant level: ~0.7 mg/dL. Declines to ~0.5 mg/dL during pregnancy. Values >0.9 mg/dL may indicate renal disease. Platelet Count During Pregnancy: Average platelet count decreases throughout pregnancy. (Option B & D) Returns to nonpregnant levels within 4 to 12 weeks postpartum. Platelet counts are lower in twin pregnancies. Reference: William’s Obstetrics, 26th Edition, Page 62,67,68",

      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: B) 1, 2 Explanation: At 8 weeks of gestation, Goodell's sign and Osiander's sign can be elicited. Goodell's sign (Option 1): The softening of the cervix, noticeable as early as the 6th week of pregnancy, is a classic sign of pregnancy. Osiander's sign (Option 2): Pulsations in the lateral fornix due to increased vascularity, often observed around 8 weeks of gestation. Sign Description Time of Occurrence Goodell's Sign (1) Softening of the cervix 6th week Ladin's Sign Softening at the midpoint of the isthmus anteriorly Around 6 weeks Jacquemier's/Chadwick's Sign Dark bluish-red coloration of the vaginal mucosa and cervix 6-8 weeks Palmer's Sign Regular & rhythmic uterine contractions 4-8 weeks Von Braun-Fernwald's Sign Irregular softening and enlargement of the uterine fundus 5-8 weeks McDonald's Sign Easy flexibility of the uterus on the cervix 7-8 weeks Hegar's Sign Firm cervix contrasts with the softer fundus, with a compressible, softened isthmus 6-10 weeks Piskacek's Sign One half of the uterus is firmer than the other half (lateral implantation) 6-12 weeks Osiander's Sign (2) Presence of a softening, compressible, and enlarging uterus, often felt with palpation 8th week Placental Sign Cyclic bleeding occurring up to 12 weeks of pregnancy Up to 12 weeks Internal Ballottement (3): Palpation technique to detect fetal movement by bouncing the fetus away and then back. Elicited between 16-28 weeks of gestation. Before 16 weeks: Fetus too small. After 28 weeks: Fetus too large. Limitations: Scanty liquor amnii (low amniotic fluid). Transverse lie of fetus. Lightening (4): Relief of pressure symptoms due to the engagement of the presenting part into the pelvic cavity. Felt around 38 weeks of gestation, primarily in primigravida (first-time pregnancies).

      "question": "Consider the following actions under AMTSL (Active Management of the Third Stage of Labor). Arrange them in the correct order: Uterine massage Give uterotonic (oxytocin 10 IU) Exclude the presence of another fetus Controlled cord traction",
      "options": {
        "A": "3,1,2,4",

      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: B) 3,2,4,1 Explanation: The correct sequence in Active Management of the Third Stage of Labor (AMTSL) is 3, 2, 4, 1, which is the recommended order to prevent postpartum hemorrhage (PPH). Steps Before Starting AMTSL: Confirm delivery of the baby. Exclude the presence of another fetus in the uterus.(Statement 3) Assess fetal condition, position, and lie. Prepare the uterotonic drug. Check maternal vitals and overall condition. Ready instruments for cord clamping. Inform the mother about the procedure. Check for signs of placental detachment. 1. Injecting Uterotonics Inject uterotonic (e.g., Oxytocin 10 IU) within 1 minute of delivery of the baby or immediately after the delivery of the anterior shoulder. (Statement 2) Most important step in AMTSL. Oxytocin (10 IU IM/IV infusion) is the preferred uterotonic. Not recommended by WHO: carboprost. Administer within 1-3 minutes of delivery. 2. Delayed Cord Clamping Delay cord clamping for at least 1 minute after birth. About 80 ml of additional blood goes to the fetus. Helps prevent fetal anemia by allowing time for placental blood flow to transfer to the baby. 3. Delivery of Placenta by Controlled Cord Traction Perform controlled cord traction using the modified Brandt-Andrews technique. (Statement 4) Controlled cord traction should be done after administering uterotonics. Technique: apply gentle downward traction to the cord while counter-traction on the uterine fundus facilitates placental delivery. 4. Intermittent Assessment of Uterine Tone Assess uterine tone intermittently to ensure uterine contraction is maintained. Done every 15 minutes for 2 hours post-delivery. Only in settings where skilled birth attendants are available. Uterus is pushed upwards and backward while cord traction is downward and forward. 5. Uterine Massage (Optional) Perform uterine massage only if uterine atony is suspected or after placental delivery. (Statement 1) Not recommended as a routine intervention to prevent PPH in women who have already received prophylactic uterotonics (Oxytocin). Now an optional component of AMTSL in cases of uterine atony or PPH management. Reference: Williams Obstetrics, 26th Edition, Page: 507. WHO Active Management of the Third Stage of Labo",

      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: A) Cry of baby in the womb Explanation: Vagitus uterinus is a Latin term that translates to \"uterine cry\" or \"womb cry.\" It refers to the cry or sound made by a fetus while still inside the mother's womb, typically in the later stages of pregnancy. This is a rare phenomenon where the fetus is capable of producing vocalizations. In certain circumstances, these sounds can be detected during ultrasound examinations or heard by the mother, although this is not commonly observed. Vagitus uterinus is a fetal vocalization and has no association with any infections or pathological conditions. (Options B, C and D ruled out) Reference: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/4158913/",
