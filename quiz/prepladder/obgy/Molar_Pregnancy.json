      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: B) Beta HCG Explanation: Beta HCG is a hormone produced by the trophoblastic cells of the placenta. In gestational trophoblastic diseases, including choriocarcinoma, levels of beta HCG are significantly elevated. It is a key tumor marker for diagnosing, monitoring treatment response, and detecting recurrence in choriocarcinoma. hPL ( Option A) Elevated levels of Human placental lactogen (hPL) can be seen in Placental Site Trophoblastic Disease or Tumor. It is a hormone produced by the syncytiotrophoblast cells of the placenta during pregnancy and it is not a marker for choriocarcinoma. AFP ( Option C ) Alpha-fetoprotein is the tumor marker for Hepatocellular cancer and Nonseminomatous germ cell tumors. AFP is not associated with choriocarcinoma. CEA ( Option D) Carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) is the tumor marker for Ovarian, Colorectal, Pancreas, and Lung cancers. It is not linked with choriocarcinoma.

      },
      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: C) The preferred initial treatment is chemotherapy. Explanation: The given clinical scenario points towards Placental Site Trophoblastic Tumor (PSTT), which predominantly originates from intermediate trophoblasts at the placental site and comprises cytotrophoblastic cells. The preferred initial treatment for nonmetastatic PSTT is hysterectomy, not chemotherapy. PSTT can follow any type of pregnancy but most commonly occurs after a term gestation. (Option A) Patients typically experience irregular bleeding months or even years after a preceding pregnancy, and the diagnosis is usually considered only after an endometrial biopsy. PSTT tends to infiltrate locally within the uterus and disseminate late in its course. (Option B) It typically produces low levels of free beta-subunit of hCG, and an elevated proportion can aid in distinguishing it from other types of gestational trophoblastic neoplasia. (Option D) Hysterectomy is the primary treatment for nonmetastatic PSTT due to its relative insensitivity to chemotherapy. Chemotherapy is indicated for metastatic PSTT, with regimens like EMA/EP (etoposide, methotrexate, actinomycin D alternating with etoposide and cisplatin) considered most effective.

Metastases, especially to distant sites like the lungs, are typically managed with continued surveillance and possibly chemotherapy if recurrence or progression is detected. Hysterectomy is indicated as an emergency procedure in cases of severe, uncontrollable vaginal or intra-abdominal bleeding. (Option A) Hysterectomy may be performed as the primary treatment for chemotherapy-resistant forms of GTN, such as placental site trophoblastic tumor (PSTT) or epithelioid trophoblastic tumor (ETT). (Option B) In low-risk GTN cases where future fertility is not desired, adjuvant hysterectomy may be considered. Hysterectomy may also be considered for GTN confined to the uterus.

      },
      "correct_answer": "D",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: D) Theca lutein cysts Explanation: In Molar pregnancy , ovaries may appear fuller and cystic on ultrasound due to multiple theca-lutein cysts , which are more common with complete moles. Theca Lutein Cysts: These cysts are commonly associated with molar pregnancy due to high beta-hCG levels overstimulating the ovaries. hCG and Luteinising hormone share the same receptor, stimulating the theca layer around follicles. Management : Theca-lutein cysts typically regress after pregnancy evacuation and hCG level decline, favoring expectant management. Complications : Larger cysts may occasionally undergo torsion, infarction, and hemorrhage. Theca lutein cysts larger than 6cm in diameter are a potential risk factor for a malignant change in molar pregnancy, leading to choriocarcinoma. Functional ovarian cysts (Option A) are common and usually associated with the menstrual cycle. They do not typically present with such markedly elevated beta-hCG levels or in the context of a molar pregnancy. Endometriomas (Option B) are related to endometriosis and would not be associated with molar pregnancy. Dermoid cysts (Option C) (mature cystic",

      "explanation": "Correct Answer: D) Histopathological examination shows villi Explanation: The clinical presentation suggests gestational trophoblastic neoplasia. The presence of villi in histopathological examination is typical of an invasive mole, distinguishing it from choriocarcinoma, which lacks villi, thus providing a specific diagnostic feature. Feature: Choriocarcinoma Invasive Mole Causes/Origin Often follows a term pregnancy (Option A) , miscarriage, or molar pregnancy. Less commonly associated with molar gestation. Typically, it arises from a complete hydatidiform mole. Less commonly from a partial mole. Histopathological Examination (HPE) It is composed of malignant trophoblastic cells resembling early cytotrophoblast and syncytiotrophoblast. Contains no villi. Presence of both cytotrophoblast and syncytiotrophoblast cells. Shows trophoblastic proliferation with hydropic villi. Invasion/Metastasis Rapid growth with early hematogenous spread. Common metastasis sites: lungs (Option B ), vagina, liver, brain, kidneys. Locally invasive into the myometrium. It rarely metastasises but can spread to the lungs if it does.

      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: A) Hydatidiform Mole. Explanation: Hydatidiform mole is classified as a benign form of GTD and is characterized by abnormal growth of trophoblastic tissue in the uterus. This results in swollen, fluid-filled villi and significantly elevated β -hCG levels (often in the range of 100,000 mIU/mL or higher). Initially benign, they can sometimes progress to persistent gestational trophoblastic disease or malignancy. Placental Site Trophoblastic Tumor (Option B) PSTTs are considered malignant due to their potential for deep myometrial invasion and metastasis. They arise from intermediate trophoblasts at the placental implantation site. They present with slightly elevated β -hCG levels, but not as high as seen in hydatidiform moles. Choriocarcinoma (Option C) Choriocarcinoma is a highly malignant gestational trophoblastic disease that can follow any type of pregnancy event and is characterized by extremely high β -hCG levels and significant potential for rapid spread and metastasis. Epithelial Trophoblastic Tumor (Option D) Epithelial trophoblastic tumors are malignant and arise from chorionic-type intermediate trophoblast. They have low β -hCG levels.

Histopathological findings include: Partial Mole Complete Mole Focal villous edema (some villi are normal, others are edematous) Presence of fetal blood vessels in some villi. Focal trophoblastic hyperplasia Presence of fetal tissue (may include fetal red blood cells or embryonic/fetal parts). Diffuse villous edema and hydropic swelling. Absence of fetal blood vessels in villi Marked atypical trophoblastic hyperplasia (both cytotrophoblast and syncytiotrophoblast). No fetal tissue is present. Ultrasonography (USG) (Option B) is the initial choice of investigation for molar pregnancies but is not confirmatory as it may mimic missed abortions sometimes Partial mole ultrasound shows mixed echogenicity with focal cysts, possible fetal parts or sacs, thick multicystic placenta, and, if present, an abnormal or growth-restricted fetus.

      "explanation": "Correct Answer: B) 46, XY. Explanation: Complete molar pregnancies typically have a karyotype of 46, XY, or 46, XX (diploid). Feature Partial Mole Complete Mole Karyotype Usually 69, XXY or 69, XXX (triploid) (Option A, C) Usually 46, XX or 46, XY (diploid) Genetic origin 2 paternal sets + 1 maternal set All paternal (empty egg + sperm duplication) Fetal tissue It may be present but abnormal. Absent. β -hCG levels Elevated, but lower than the complete mole Very high Risk of persistent GTD 5-10% 15-20% Risk of choriocarcinoma 2-4% 2-3% Theca lutein cysts Less common Common Reference: Williams Obstetrics, 26th Edition, Page 237, 238",

      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: B) Previous history of molar pregnancy Explanation: Women who have had a previous molar pregnancy have a significantly increased risk of developing another molar pregnancy or other forms of GTD in subsequent pregnancies. Risk Factors of GTD: Ethnic predisposition: Higher prevalence in Asians, Hispanics, and American Indians Strongest risk factors: Maternal age (both extremes of reproductive age) Prior history of hydatidiform mole Risk after previous molar pregnancies: After one complete mole: 0.9% risk of another mole. After one partial mole: 0.3% risk of another mole. After two complete moles: 20% risk of a third mole. Maternal age below 35 years (Option A): Maternal age is a risk factor for GTD, but the highest risk is typically associated with maternal age at the extremes (below 20 years or above 35 years). Use of oral contraceptives (Option C) is not a risk factor for molar pregnancy Ethnicity (Asian or African descent) (Option D): While ethnicity can increase the risk, it is not as strong a risk factor as a previous history of molar pregnancy. The recurrence of GTD is much more closely linked to personal medical history rather than ethnicity alone. Reference: Williams Obstetrics, 26th Edition, Page237",
