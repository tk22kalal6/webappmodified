      "question": "A 30-year-old married woman came for an infertility evaluation. Upon further investigation, intramural fibroids of sizes 7x5cm and 5x3cm were seen at the right and left cornual ends of the uterus. Her husband's semen analysis was found to be normal. What is the appropriate management of this case?",

        "A": "Uterine artery embolization",
        "B": "Myomectomy",
        "C": "Artificial reproductive techniques",
        "D": "GnRH analogues"
      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: B) Myomectomy Explanation: The appropriate management is myomectomy to remove the fibroids and preserve fertility, as intramural fibroids can affect implantation and pregnancy, and the patient wishes to retain the uterus. Myomectomy: Surgical removal of fibroids while preserving the uterus. It is indicated for women with infertility, those desiring pregnancy, or those wishing to keep the uterus. By removing the intramural fibroids, the uterine cavity is optimized for embryo implantation, increasing the chances of successful conception and pregnancy. It can be done via hysteroscopy or laparoscopy. Hysteroscopy Laparoscopy Indication Fibroid of 3–4 cm in diameter Type 0 submucosal Type 1 submucosal Subserous Intramural fibroids Type 2 submucosal Instrument used Electrocautery Electro-diathermy Harmonics Laser Extracorporeal sutures Uterine artery embolization (Option A) is a non-surgical procedure that blocks the blood supply to the fibroids, causing them to shrink. However, it may reduce fertility and is not recommended in this case, as the patient desires to retain fertility. Artificial reproductive techniques (Option C) may be considered later if infertility persists, but myomectomy is the preferred approach to address the fibroids as the likely cause of infertility. GnRH analogues (Option D) temporarily shrink fibroids by suppressing estrogen production and may be used preoperatively to reduce fibroid size, but they are not the primary treatment in this case.

      "question": "A 33-year-old female patient comes with complaints of severe menorrhagia for the past 3 months. The duration and regularity of her menstrual cycles are normal. What is the most appropriate next step?",
      "options": {
        "A": "Uterine artery embolization",
        "B": "Endometrial ablation",
        "C": "Hormonal therapy",
        "D": "Hysterectomy"
      },
      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: C) Hormonal therapy Explanation: Hormonal therapy, such as oral contraceptive pills or progestin-only therapy, is often considered the initial treatment for menorrhagia. These hormonal treatments can help regulate the menstrual cycle and reduce excessive menstrual bleeding. They work by stabilizing the endometrium (inner lining of the uterus) and decreasing its thickness, thereby reducing the amount of menstrual bleeding. Hormonal therapy is effective for many women with menorrhagia and is considered a conservative approach before considering more invasive interventions. Uterine artery embolization (Option A) is a minimally invasive procedure used to treat conditions such as uterine fibroids. It involves blocking the blood supply to the uterus to shrink the fibroids and reduce symptoms. While it can be an effective treatment for certain cases of menorrhagia, it is usually considered when other conservative treatment options have failed or are not suitable. Endometrial ablation (Option B) is a procedure that destroys the inner lining of the uterus (endometrium) to reduce or stop menstrual bleeding. It is typically considered for women who have completed childbearing and have persistent or recurrent menorrhagia that has not responded to other treatments. It is a more invasive option compared to hormonal therapy and may not be the first-line choice in this scenario. Hysterectomy (Option D) involves surgical removal of the uterus and is a definitive treatment for menorrhagia. It is typically reserved for cases where conservative management options have failed or are not appropriate. Hysterectomy is a major surgical procedure and is usually considered when other treatments have not been successful or when there are other underlying conditions necessitating removal of the uterus.

      "question": "A patient is planned to undergo hysteroscopic polypectomy using bipolar electrocautery. What is the ideal agent for distention?",
      "options": {
        "A": "Glycine",
        "B": "Normal saline",
        "C": "CO 2",
        "D": "70% dextrose"
      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: B) Normal saline Explanation: Normal saline is the most commonly used distention medium in hysteroscopy. It is a sterile isotonic solution of sodium chloride in water. It provides excellent visualization of the uterine cavity, helps maintain the shape of the uterus, and allows for safe manipulation of the hysteroscope. Normal saline is readily available, cost-effective, and well-tolerated by the patient's body. Incorrect Options: Glycine (Option A) is another commonly used distention medium in hysteroscopy. However, it carries a risk of fluid overload and fluid absorption complications, such as hyponatremia and fluid overload syndrome. Glycine should be used with caution, especially in patients with impaired renal function or those at risk of fluid overload. Carbon dioxide (CO2) (Option C) is occasionally used as a distention medium in hysteroscopy. It has the advantage of rapid absorption by the body, reducing the risk of fluid overload complications. However, CO2 can cause distention discomfort and pain in some patients. Additionally, it requires specialized equipment for its use, which may not be readily available in all settings. 70% dextrose (Option D) is not a suitable distention medium for hysteroscopy. It is a hypertonic solution that can cause cellular dehydration and tissue damage. Using dextrose as a distention medium can lead to complications and is not recommended.

      "question": "A 60-year-old woman presented with post–menopausal bleeding. Ultrasonography revealed a mass with a “feeding vessel”, as shown in the image below. What is the most likely diagnosis?",
      "options": {
        "A": "Fibroid uterus",

        "C": "Endometrial carcinoma",
        "D": "Leiomyosarcoma"
      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: B) Endometrial polyp Explanation: Feeding vessel sign in ultrasound is characteristic of Endometrial polyp Endometrial polyps are soft, fleshy growths that form inside the uterus, composed of endometrial glands, fibrous tissue, and surface epithelium. Factors such as aging, obesity, and tamoxifen use increase the likelihood of developing polyps. Endometrial polyps may remain asymptomatic and are often discovered incidentally during imaging procedures for other reasons. When symptoms are present, they are commonly linked to heavy menstrual bleeding (HMB), prolonged bleeding, or intermenstrual bleeding. The primary diagnostic methods include transvaginal ultrasound (TVS) with color Doppler, saline infusion sonography (SIS), and hysteroscopy . TVS is best performed early in the menstrual cycle to avoid false positives from normal secretory endometrium. Color Doppler can help distinguish them from submucous fibroids, as polyps generally have a single arterial feeding vessel. Treatment of endometrial polyps is based on symptoms and the risk of malignancy. Although most polyps are benign, a small percentage can undergo malignant transformation. Higher risks for transformation are associated with postmenopausal status, age over 60, and abnormal bleeding. Higher risks for malignant transformation are associated with postmenopausal status, age over 60, and abnormal bleeding . Larger polyps, tamoxifen use, diabetes, and obesity may also increase the risk. In such cases, hysteroscopic polypectomy is the preferred treatment. Incorrect Options: Uterine fibroids (Option A) , or leiomyomas, are benign tumors that arise from the smooth muscle tissue of the uterus. While they can cause abnormal uterine bleeding, they are less commonly associated with post-menopausal bleeding. On ultrasonography, fibroids appear as solid masses within the uterine wall and do not typically show a feeding vessel. Endometrial carcinoma (Option C) refers to cancerous growth in the inner lining of the uterus (endometrium). Post-menopausal bleeding is one of the key symptoms of endometrial carcinoma. However, on ultrasonography, endometrial carcinoma may appear as",

      "options": {
        "A": "Hysterectomy",
        "B": "Myomectomy",
        "C": "No intervention as the patient is asymptomatic",
        "D": "Medical management"
      },
      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: A) Hysterectomy Explanation: Hysterectomy is not indicated in an asymptomatic patient with a fibroid unless there are other compelling reasons for the procedure. As mentioned in the question, the size of the fibroid is that of a 14-week fetus, which would be >10cm. It can cause compression of the bowel and bladder, torsion, degeneration, or it can detach. As the patient has completed the family and does not have any specific symptoms, hysterectomy would be the best option. Myomectomy (Option B) , which involves surgical removal of fibroids, is generally performed when symptomatic fibroids are causing significant issues or fertility problems. It is not necessary for an asymptomatic patient with a complete family. In an asymptomatic patient with a fibroid of <5cm (Option C) , the next step in management is typically observation without intervention. Asymptomatic fibroids do not require immediate treatment, especially in the absence of symptoms such as pain, abnormal bleeding, or pressure symptoms. Medical management (Option D) is used to control symptoms or shrink fibroids temporarily. As the patient is asymptomatic, medical management is not necessary.

        "C": "Hysterectomy",
        "D": "Endometrial sampling"
      },
      "correct_answer": "D",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: D) Endometrial sampling Explanation: In a 50-year-old woman with abnormal uterine bleeding, the next step in management is to perform endometrial sampling. Abnormal uterine bleeding in postmenopausal women can be a sign of endometrial hyperplasia or endometrial cancer. Endometrial sampling, such as endometrial biopsy or hysteroscopy with biopsy, is essential for obtaining tissue for histological examination to rule out any underlying malignancy or precancerous conditions. A levonorgestrel-releasing intrauterine contraceptive device (LNG-IUCD) (Option A) is not the next line of management for abnormal uterine bleeding in a postmenopausal woman. It may be considered for managing abnormal uterine bleeding in premenopausal women. Progestin-only pills (POP) (Option B) are not the first-line management for abnormal uterine bleeding in a postmenopausal woman. POPs are primarily used for contraception in premenopausal women. Hysterectomy (Option C) is not the initial step in the management of abnormal uterine bleeding. It is typically reserved for cases where medical management or less invasive interventions have failed or when there is a definite diagnosis of malignancy.

      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: C) Ulipristal Explanation: Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is a hormonal disorder characterized by hormonal imbalances, irregular menstrual cycles, and the formation of small cysts on the ovaries. The treatment of PCOS aims to manage the symptoms and restore hormonal balance. Ulipristal is an emergency contraceptive pill that is used to prevent pregnancy after unprotected sex or after the failure of another birth control method. It works by preventing or delaying ovulation. Clomiphene citrate (Option A) is a medication commonly used for the treatment of PCOS. It works by stimulating ovulation, making it useful for women with PCOS who are trying to conceive. Letrozole (Option B) is another medication often used for inducing ovulation in women with PCOS. It is an aromatase inhibitor that helps regulate estrogen levels and promote ovulation. Laparoscopic ovarian drilling (Option D) is a surgical procedure used to treat PCOS in cases where medication has not been effective or well-tolerated. It involves making small punctures or using a laser or electrical current to destroy a small portion of the ovarian tissue, which can help restore ovulation and improve fertility.

      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: A) Endometriosis Explanation: A teenage patient with dysmenorrhea, chronic pelvic pain, and a transverse vaginal septum is most likely to develop endometriosis due to retrograde menstruation. Endometriosis is a condition where endometrial tissue grows outside the uterus, causing pelvic pain and other symptoms. A transverse vaginal septum causes vaginal obstruction, leading to retrograde menstruation , where menstrual blood flows back into the pelvis instead of exiting the body. According to Sampson's theory , retrograde menstruation allows endometrial cells to implant in the pelvic cavity. This leads to the development of endometriosis , which results in dysmenorrhea and chronic pelvic pain . Tubo-ovarian abscess (Option B): A transverse vaginal septum does not directly cause tubo-ovarian abscesses, which are more commonly associated with pelvic inflammatory disease (PID). Dermoid cyst (Option C) is an ovarian cyst containing tissues like hair, skin, and teeth. It is not directly related to a transverse vaginal septum and is not the most common complication in this case. Theca lutein cyst (Option D) are associated with hormonal imbalances, particularly in gestational trophoblastic disease or multiple gestations. They are not directly related to the presence of a transverse vaginal septum. Reference: William’s Gynecology 4th Edition, Page 418",

Tamoxifen is a selective estrogen receptor modulator (SERM) primarily used for the treatment of estrogen receptor-positive breast cancer. Drugs used to treat Infertility in PCOS Letrozole (preferred over clomiphene citrate): Aromatase inhibitors No antiestrogenic action on the endometrium and cervix, thus yielding a better pregnancy rate. Induces Mono Follicular stimulation, thus avoiding multiple pregnancies. No hyperstimulation syndrome. Side effect - drowsiness. Clomiphene citrate: (Option A) Unlike letrozole, it has anti-estrogenic action on the endometrium and cervix, thereby decreasing the fertility rate. It can cause hyperstimulation Syndrome in <1% of patients. It induces ovulation in 80% of the cases, and 40-45% conceive. Co-administration of dexamethasone leads to better outcomes. In resistant cases, Tamoxifen 80-160 mg daily for 5 days is tried. Metformin: (Option B) It is used as an insulin sensitiser. Reduces the insulin levels, delays glucose absorption and production of glucose in the liver It also improves the peripheral utilisation of the glucose. Reduces the free and total testosterone and increases SHBG. Contraindicated in hepatic and renal disease Oral Contraceptive Pills (OCP): (Option D) Fourth-generation combined pills containing ethinyl estradiol and drospirenone are preferred. Oral combined pills with Cyproterone acetate (DOC) Oral combined pills with spironolactone Used to treat menstrual abnormalities, reducing acne and hirsutism. Nowadays, instead of Metformin, some gynaecologists prefer using N-acetyl cysteine with micronutrients. This reduces the homocysteine level and improves fertility outcomes. Ketoconazole 800mg daily reduces testosterone secretion. If medical management fails, then surgical management can be undertaken.

This indicates amenorrhea resulting from mechanical factors rather than hormonal dysfunction (normal FSH levels) Asherman syndrome is the formation of scar tissue (also called adhesions or intrauterine adhesions) in the uterine cavity. The problem most often develops after operative hysteroscopy, Dilation and Curettage (D&C) and Cesarean section, as a side effect of cancer treatment or infection. The adhesions may cause amenorrhea (lack of menstrual periods), hypomenorrhea, repeated miscarriages , and infertility. FSH levels are not high or low (6 mIU/ml is normal) , indicating a case of typical Ashermann Syndrome Incorrect Options: Sheehan's syndrome (Option A) presents with hypopituitarism following severe postpartum hemorrhage, leading to low FSH levels and other pituitary hormonal deficiencies. The normal FSH level, in this case, rules out this condition. Premature ovarian failure (Option B) : For the diagnosis of premature ovarian failure, the follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) should be > 20 IU/l. PCOS (Option C) : PCOS typically presents with irregular menses, hyperandrogenism, and polycystic ovaries on ultrasound. While FSH levels may be normal, the absence of hyperandrogenic symptoms point away from this diagnosis. Also, PCOS patients typically have oligomenorrhea rather than complete amenorrhea.

      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: B) Serum testosterone Explanation: The clinical scenario with irregular periods, acne, increased facial hair growth, and multiple ovarian follicles on ultrasound point towards diagnosis of Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS). In PCOS, serum tests typically show elevated serum testosterone levels. Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS), also known as Stein-Leventhal syndrome, is a heterogeneous, multisystem endocrinopathy in women of reproductive age with ovarian expression of various metabolic disturbances. Components of PCOS : Increased androgens Ovulatory dysfunction Polycystic ovaries Clinical features : Usually present in young women Central obesity (BMI > 30kg/cm 2 ), waistline> 88cm. Oligomenorrhea, amenorrhoea Infertility Hirsutism Acanthosis nigricans due to insulin resistance Endocrinological changes in Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS): Oestrone/Estrone levels rise. Luteinizing hormone (LH) levels are elevated (>10 IU/mL). FSH levels remain normal (Option C) , but the FSH/LH ratio decreases. (Option D) Sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG) levels fall due to hyperandrogenism. (Option A) Testosterone and epi-androstenedione levels increase. Fasting blood glucose and insulin levels suggest insulin resistance, with fasting insulin levels >10 mIU/L in 50-70% of cases. Triglyceride levels rise (>150 mg/dL), indicating hyperlipidemia, and HDL (High-Density Lipoprotein) is low (<50 mg/dL). Testosterone levels may exceed 2 ng/mL, with free testosterone >2.2 pg/mL (normal range: 0.2-0.8 ng/mL). Androstenedione levels are typically normal. Dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate (DHEA-S) levels are raised. Prolactin may be mildly elevated in 15% of cases. Thyroid function tests can be abnormal, with a tendency toward hypothyroidism. Urinary cortisol levels are low (<50 µg/24 hours). Rotterdam Criteria for diagnosing PCOS: Two of the following three criteria must be present: Increased androgen levels: Leading to symptoms like hirsutism or acne, or biochemical findings such as high testosterone. Ovulatory dysfunction : Irregular or absent menstrual cycles (oligomenorrhea/ amenorrhea) due to ovulatory dysfunction. Ultrasound findings: Ovaries with >12 follicles (2-9mm) and/or ovarian volume ≥ 10 cm³, showing a \"necklace pattern\" of cysts arranged peripherally with excessive stromal tissue in the centre producing androgens. Management: Lifestyle Modifications: Weight Loss: Improves hormonal balance and reduces testosterone and insulin levels. Lifestyle Changes: Smoking cessation. Pharmacologic Treatment: OCPs: Regulate menstruation, treat hirsutism, and improve acne. Anti-androgens: Spironolactone and ketoconazole reduce testosterone. Metformin: Improves fertility and lowers insulin and testosterone levels. Dexamethasone: Reduces androgen production. Infertility Treatment: Clomiphene Citrate: For ovulation induction. Letrozole: For clomiphene-resistant cases. Surgical Treatment: Laparoscopic Ovarian Drilling: For infertility or hyperstimulation despite medical therapy. Surgery is indicated if: Medical therapy fails Hyperstimulation occurs Infertility persists There are previous pregnancy losses",

        "C": "Oral glucose tolerance test",
        "D": "ANA"
      },
      "correct_answer": "D",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer D - ANA Turner’s syndrome is caused by monosomy of the X chromosomes; hence, ANA is not a suitable test for this. ANA or Antinuclear antibody test is done for autoimmune diseases like SLE, scleroderma, rheumatoid arthritis, etc. Autoimmune diseases associated with Turner’s syndrome include autoimmune thyroiditis, celiac disease, and rarely Type 1 diabetes. Turner mosaic syndrome Turner’s syndrome is due to the deletion or non-functioning of one of the X chromosomes in females and is a /genetic condition. 50% of the population has a mosaic chromosomal component (45, X mosaicism). Mosaic Turner syndrome is not an inherited condition. Cause: Random event during the cell division at the early fetal stage. As a result of this process, some cells of the person have normal 2 sex chromosomes while other cells have only one copy of the X chromosome. ECHO or echocardiography (Option A) is a type of imaging of the heart for the detection of cardiovascular abnormalities. Cardiac anomalies like the bicuspid aortic valve and coarctation of the aorta are seen in Turner’s syndrome. Even though milder forms are associated with Mosaic Turner syndrome, regular screening with echocardiography is advised. Periodic audiometry (Option B) is recommended to be done every 3-5 years to detect sensorineural hearing loss since hearing loss and cholesteatoma are seen with Turner’s syndrome. Oral glucose tolerance test (Option C) is done as the majority of patients with Turner’s syndrome have abnormalities in glucose metabolism, including insulin resistance. Screening for diabetes in Turner’s syndrome can be done by estimation of HbA1C or by oral glucose tolerance test. Amongst these, oral glucose tolerance tests are considered more sensitive.

      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer B - Anovulation Anovulation is the most common cause of pubertal menorrhagia. Physiology of pubertal amenorrhea: During puberty, maturation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-ovarian axis causes an increase in GnRH, which induces the secretion of pituitary gonadotropins (LH and FSH). The timing of LH pulses is crucial in establishing normal ovulatory cycles. Anovulatory cycles are due to hypothalamic-pituitary-ovarian axis dysfunction. Immaturity of the hypothalamus leads to lower levels of LH and FSH, which are sufficient to induce follicular development and estrogen production but inadequate to induce follicular maturation and ovulation. Inadequate positive feedback results in sustained high levels of estrogen causing endometrial hyperplasia. This ultimately outgrows its blood supply and architectural support, causing partial breakdown and irregular shedding. Endometriosis (Option A) is the presence of ectopic endometrial tissue away from the cavity of the uterus. Endometriosis and adenomyosis are causes of abnormal uterine bleeding more commonly in the reproductive age group rather than around puberty. Malignancy (Option C) causing menorrhagia is rare but may occur in women with chronic anovulation, especially due to polycystic ovarian disease . Genitourinary malignancies are extremely rare in adolescents. Adenomyosis (Option D) is ectopic endometrial tissue within the wall of the uterus. Endometriosis and adenomyosis are causes of abnormal uterine bleeding, more commonly in the reproductive age group rather than around puberty.

        "D": "Cervical agenesis"
      },
      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Correct answer: C) Imperforate hymen The patient's presentation of cyclic abdominal pain, the absence of menarche, and the finding of a bulging central suprapubic bulge on physical examination are characteristics of an imperforate hymen causing cryptomenorrhea. Causes: Congenital Causes: Imperforate hymen Transverse vaginal septum Atresia of the upper third of the vagina and cervix Acquired Causes: Stenosis of the cervix following amputation, deep cauterization, and conization Secondary vaginal atresia following neglected and difficult vaginal delivery. Clinical Features: Patients are usually around 13-15 years old (congenital cases). Symptoms: Periodic lower abdominal pain and, in cases of hematocolpos, urine retention occurs Physical Examination: An abdominal exam reveals a uniform globular mass in the hypogastrium . Vulvar inspection shows a bulging hymen. Rectal examination confirms a full vagina and uterine mass. Management: Imperforate Hymen: Perform a cruciate incision and drain the accumulated blood. Cervical Stenosis: Dilate the cervix to relieve the obstruction. A transverse vaginal septum (Option A) refers to the presence of a band of tissue or membrane that obstructs the vaginal canal and can cause various symptoms depending on the location and extent of the septum. However, in the given scenario, a bulging swelling in the lower abdomen and a bulging swelling on PR examination is more consistent with an imperforate hymen rather than a transverse vaginal septum above the vagina. Vaginal atresia (Option B) is the absence or incomplete development of the vagina that can be a congenital condition or result from acquired causes such as scarring or radiation therapy. While vaginal atresia can present with cyclical pelvic pain and delayed menarche, it doesn’t present with suprapubic bulging. Cervical agenesis (Option D) is a rare condition in which the cervix (the lower part of the uterus) fails to develop properly or is absent and is usually associated with other abnormalities of the reproductive system.",

      "explanation": "Correct Answer: A) Levels of follicle-stimulating hormone are reduced Explanation: A male presenting with infertility was found to have an XXY karyotype, consistent with a diagnosis of Klinefelter syndrome . Levels of follicle-stimulating hormone are elevated, not reduced , in this condition. Klinefelter Syndrome: Male hypogonadism caused by an extra X chromosome (e.g., 47,XXY). Most common sex chromosome disorder (1 in 5000 male births). Clinical Features: Body Habit: Elongated body, eunuchoid habitus, abnormally long legs. Hypogonadism: Small testes , small penis, and absent secondary male characteristics (deep voice, beard, male pubic hair).

      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: C) The cruciate incision on the hymen Explanation: The clinical manifestations indicate imperforate hymen with resulting hematocolpos , requiring surgical correction through a cruciate incision . The hymen is a delicate membrane of stratified squamous epithelium guarding vaginal introitus. Imperforate hymen occurs when hymen fails to break during nascent growth. Clinical presentation varies by age, obstruction degree, and symptoms. Cyclic monthly discomfort occurs due to hematometra (menstrual blood extending vaginal canal and uterus). Treatment: Cruciate hymenectomy is the standard treatment for imperforate hymen Simple surgical procedure where hymen is cut along incision edges. Incorrect Options: Excision of the septum (Option A) is appropriate for treating vaginal septum but not imperforate hymen. The presence of a bulging membrane at the introitus indicates imperforate hymen rather than a septum. Extensive dissection and vaginoplasty (Option B) is reserved for cases of vaginal agenesis or severe vaginal anomalies. This patient has a normal vagina with only hymenal obstruction. Hysterectomy (Option D) : Hysterectomy would be extremely inappropriate as this is a benign, easily correctable condition affecting only the hymen.

      "correct_answer": "D",
      "explanation": "Correct answer: D) Male pseudohermaphroditism Explanation: The 18-year-old girl with amenorrhea, normal external genitalia, normal breast development, and 5 alpha-reductase deficiency points towards male pseudohermaphroditism. Pseudohermaphroditism: Refers to a condition where the gonads and external genitalia are of opposite sexes. Male pseudohermaphroditism (MPH): 46XY karyotype with testes, but external genitalia may appear female or ambiguous. Often caused by defects in testosterone biosynthetic enzymes, androgen receptors, or 5-alpha-reductase. 5-alpha-reductase deficiency results in incomplete virilization and external genitalia resembling female phenotype, though male characteristics may develop at puberty. Management focuses on gender role rehabilitation, typically in accordance with the sex of rearing. Female pseudohermaphroditism: (Option C) 46XX karyotype with ovaries, but external genitalia appear male or ambiguous. Most commonly caused by congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH), resulting in excess androgens and virilization of the female fetus. Leads to clitoromegaly and fused labioscrotal folds resembling a scrotum. Management includes steroid therapy, estrogen administration, and surgical reconstruction of external genitalia. Concealed sex (Option A) refers to hiding one’s true sex (e.g., through clothing or deception), often for legal or social reasons. Physical examination typically reveals the true sex. This does not fit as the patient has normal genitalia and normal breast development, and the diagnosis is more likely related to 5-alpha-reductase deficiency. True hermaphroditism (Option B) is a rare condition with both ovarian and testicular tissue. The patient has 46XY karyotype, no evidence of both gonads, and normal genitalia, making this diagnosis unlikely.

Common causes of secondary amenorrhea: Physiological Causes: Pregnancy Lactation Pathological Causes: Genital Tract: Acquired cervical canal obstruction Asherman syndrome (Option D) Vaginal atresia Vesicovaginal fistula Ovarian Causes: Surgical extirpation, radiotherapy Multiple ovulation induction PCOD Resistant ovarian syndrome (absent FSH receptors) Infections (e.g., mumps, tuberculosis) Masculinizing ovarian tumors Premature ovarian failure/menopause Pituitary Causes: Insufficiency: Simmonds disease, Sheehan syndrome (Option C) Hyperprolactinemia, prolactinomas Empty sella syndrome Drugs (e.g., tranquillizers, OC pills, dopamine blockers, antihypertensives, antidepressants) Hypothalamic Causes: GnRH deficiency, vigorous exercise, stress, obesity Pseudocyesis, brain tumors, anorexia nervosa Suprarenal Causes: Addison disease, adrenogenital syndrome, suprarenal tumors Thyroid Causes: Hypothyroidism, chest wall lesions, Graves' disease Turner’s mosaic (Option A): Turner syndrome causes primary amenorrhea, while Turner mosaicism can present with either primary or secondary amenorrhea, making Kallmann syndrome the best answer in this case.

      },
      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: C) Imperforate hymen Explanation: The given scenario is characteristic of Imperforate hymen. Imperforate hymen is a congenital condition where the hymen fails to perforate during fetal development. This condition leads to the accumulation of menstrual blood in the vagina ( hematocolpos ) and uterus ( hematometra ), causing symptoms such as amenorrhea (absence of menstruation), urinary retention due to pressure on the bladder, and a visible bulge at the vaginal introitus . The bluish hue seen on physical examination is due to the blood collected behind the imperforate hymen. Incorrect Options: A transverse septum in the proximal vagina (Option A) is a barrier that divides the vagina into two separate compartments. It can cause obstruction and may present with symptoms like hematocolpos (accumulation of menstrual blood in the vagina). However, it does not typically result in a bulge protruding from the vagina. Complete vaginal atresia (Option B) refers to the complete absence of the vagina. It is a rare condition and usually presents with primary amenorrhea. However, in this case, the presence of a bulge protruding from the vagina suggests a different pathology. Cervical agenesis (Option D) is a rare condition where the cervix is absent or underdeveloped. It can lead to primary amenorrhea but does not typically cause a bulge protruding from the vagina.

      },
      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: A) Hair growth Explanation: Hair growth during puberty is mainly influenced by androgens, not estrogen. Androgens, such as testosterone, play a significant role in the development of secondary sexual characteristics, including pubic hair growth in both males and females. Cervical mucus secretion (Option B) is influenced by estrogen. During puberty, the increasing levels of estrogen stimulate the cervical glands to produce and secrete mucus, which helps facilitate sperm transport and fertility. Vaginal cornification (Option C) is a process in which the cells lining the vaginal epithelium undergo changes, becoming thicker and more keratinized. Estrogen plays a vital role in promoting vaginal cornification during puberty. It helps transform the vaginal epithelium from a thin, delicate state to a thicker, more resistant state. Menstruation (Option D) is a complex process that involves hormonal changes, particularly the interaction of estrogen and progesterone. Estrogen stimulates the growth and development of the endometrium (lining of the uterus) during the menstrual cycle. However, progesterone, along with estrogen, is primarily responsible for initiating and regulating menstruation. Reference: Berek and Novak's Gynecology [Puberty- hormonal changes]",

      "explanation": "Correct Answer: B) Karyotyping Explanation: Karyotyping is the most appropriate next step in the diagnosis of primary amenorrhea with the absence of a uterus. The presence of axillary and pubic hair, along with normal secondary sexual characteristics, suggests the presence of functional ovaries. However, the absence of the uterus raises the suspicion of a chromosomal abnormality, such as Turner syndrome (45,X), which is a common cause of primary amenorrhea with the absence of the uterus.

Incorrect Options: Testosterone levels (Option A) are more relevant in cases of androgen excess or virilization, which is not indicated in this scenario. Estrogen measurement (Option C): Since the patient has primary amenorrhea and the absence of uterus, the focus should be on evaluating chromosomal abnormalities rather than measuring estrogen levels. LH and FSH measurement (Option D) can be helpful in the diagnosis of primary amenorrhea, but karyotyping takes priority in this case. LH and FSH levels can provide information about the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis and help differentiate between various causes of primary amenorrhea.

      "explanation": "Correct Answer: C) LH, FSH levels Explanation: The presentation of primary amenorrhea in a 16-year-old girl with absent thelarche (breast development) and a normal stature raises concerns about possible hormonal imbalances affecting her reproductive system. LH (luteinizing hormone) and FSH (follicle-stimulating hormone) are the two hormones involved in regulating the menstrual cycle and reproductive function. Abnormal levels of these hormones can provide valuable insights into potential causes of amenorrhea, such as hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis dysfunction, polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), or ovarian insufficiency. Diagnostic laparoscopy (Option A) is used to visually examine the pelvic organs for structural issues, but it is not the first step in investigating primary amenorrhea. Hormonal tests are needed initially to assess the endocrine system. Pelvic ultrasound (Option B) provides information about the reproductive organs (e.g., uterus, ovaries), but given the absence of thelarche, a hormonal investigation (LH and FSH levels) should be prioritized to assess the function of the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis. CT brain (Option D) is not the primary investigation for primary amenorrhea unless there are additional symptoms suggesting an intracranial abnormality, such as a pituitary tumor.

      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: C) Reassure mother and patient Explanation: Delayed onset of menstruation is considered normal in some cases, particularly when secondary sexual characteristics are present. Menstruation can be absent until the age of 15 years, which is within the normal range of puberty development. Reassurance and educating the family about normal variations in the onset of menstruation are appropriate steps. If menstruation has not started by the age of 16 or if other concerns arise, further evaluation can be pursued. Delayed Puberty refers to: No periods till 13 years if secondary sexual characters are absent. No periods till 15 years if secondary sexual characters are present. Causes of Delayed Puberty Category Causes Hypogonadotropic Hypogonadism Constitutional delay Chronic illness, malnutrition Primary hypothyroidism Isolated gonadotropin deficiency (Kallman’s Syndrome) Intracranial lesions- Tumors (craniopharyngioma, pituitary adenomas) Hypergonadotropic Hypogonadism Gonadal dysgenesis (Turner’s Syndrome) Pure gonadal dysgenesis Ovarian failure Eugonadism Anatomic causes (Mullerian agenesis, Imperforate hymen) Androgen insensitivity syndrome Combined oral contraceptives (Option A): Not indicated in this case. Contraceptives are used to regulate menstrual cycles or for contraception, which is not necessary for a 14-year-old girl who has not yet started menstruating. Karyotyping (Option B): The presence of secondary sexual characteristics and normal uterus and ovaries on ultrasound suggest normal physiological development, so karyotyping is not necessary at this point. LH, FSH level and TSH testing (Option D): Since secondary sexual characteristics are normal and the ultrasound findings are unremarkable, hormonal testing is unnecessary unless other symptoms are present or the delay persists beyond typical developmental timelines.

      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: C) Beta hCG estimation Explanation: The first step in a woman with irregular menstrual cycles, especially with a history of regular periods, is to rule out pregnancy. A beta hCG test is used to detect pregnancy, and it is essential to ensure that the irregular cycles are not caused by pregnancy before further investigation or management. Condition Serial beta-hCG Measurement Normal Intrauterine Pregnancy Rising beta-hCG (doubling every 1.4–2 days) Ectopic Pregnancy Plateauing or declining beta-hCG Threatened Abortion Variable beta-hCG changes Early Pregnancy Loss Declining beta-hCG hCG (Human Chorionic Gonadotropin) hCG is a glycoprotein hormone secreted by the syncytiotrophoblast of the placenta. It can be detected in the maternal blood and urine as early as 8–9 days post-fertilization using techniques like radioimmunoassay. During early pregnancy, hCG levels double every 1.4–2 days. Functions of hCG: Rescue of the Corpus Luteum: The primary role of hCG is to stimulate the secretion of progesterone by the corpus luteum during the first 6 weeks of pregnancy, maintaining the uterine environment. Leydig Cell Stimulation: It stimulates Leydig cells in the male fetus to produce testosterone, crucial for male sexual differentiation. Steroidogenesis: hCG supports steroid hormone production by the adrenal glands and placenta. Thyrotropic Activity: It stimulates the maternal thyroid gland due to its structural similarity to TSH, leading to mild thyroid activation during pregnancy. Relaxin Secretion: hCG promotes the secretion of relaxin from the corpus luteum, which helps in softening the cervix and ligaments in late pregnancy. Clinical Implications of hCG Levels: High hCG levels: Associated with multiple pregnancies, hydatidiform mole, choriocarcinoma, and Down syndrome (trisomy 21). Low hCG levels: Seen in ectopic pregnancies and impending miscarriages. Transvaginal ultrasound (Option A): While useful for evaluating pelvic organs and identifying conditions like ovarian cysts or fibroids, a transvaginal ultrasound is not the first step when pregnancy is a possibility. Reassure her that it’s normal to have delayed periods (Option B): While occasional menstrual irregularities can occur due to factors like stress or hormonal changes, given the patient’s history of regular cycles, further evaluation is needed to rule out other causes, particularly pregnancy. Serum FSH and LH (Option D): Serum FSH and LH are useful for evaluating the hypothalamic-pituitary-ovarian axis, especially when conditions like polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) are suspected. However, ruling out pregnancy should be the first step in this case. Reference: Williams Gynaecology, 4th Edition, Page: 140.",

Serial beta hCG measurements are the first choice investigation for suspected ectopic pregnancy when ultrasound is inconclusive. Normal rise in early viable pregnancy shows doubling of beta-hCG levels over 48 hours Discriminatory zone (1500-2000 mIU/mL) represents the beta hCG level at which a gestational sac should be visible on transvaginal ultrasound Abnormal rise or plateau suggests potential ectopic pregnancy and guides further management Diagnostic Modality Findings for Unruptured Ectopic Pregnancy Beta hCG Levels Failure to double the value of β -hCG in 48 hours Lower concentration of β -hCG than expected for gestational age Transvaginal Sonography (TVS) Absence of Intrauterine Pregnancy: No gestational sac within the uterine cavity when β -hCG ≥ 1500 IU/L. Adnexal Mass: An adnexal mass clearly separate from the ovary (Blob sign). Ring-of-Fire Pattern: Increased blood flow around the ectopic mass on Color Doppler. Presence of pseudo gestational sac. Free fluid in the Pouch of Douglas Transabdominal Sonography (TAS) Absence of Intrauterine Pregnancy: No gestational sac when β -hCG ≥ 6,000 IU/L Other features: May be visible but less sensitive than TVS for smaller masses Methotrexate administration (Option B): Medical management with methotrexate is inappropriate without definitively diagnosing an ectopic pregnancy and ensuring specific selection criteria are met. Methotrexate is contraindicated if there is any possibility of a viable intrauterine pregnancy. Laparotomy (Option C): Emergency laparotomy is reserved for patients with suspected ectopic pregnancy who are hemodynamically unstable or show signs of acute abdomen. This patient is stable and requires definitive diagnosis before any surgical intervention. Diagnostic laparoscopy (Option D): While laparoscopy is the definitive diagnostic tool for ectopic pregnancy, it is too invasive as an initial diagnostic step when the patient is stable and diagnosis is unclear. Less invasive options like serial beta hCG monitoring should be exhausted first. Reference: Williams Obstetrics, 25th Edition, Pages 385-389",

It is a rare and potentially life-threatening condition. The diagnosis of abdominal pregnancy can be challenging due to its rarity and varied clinical presentations. However, certain criteria have been established to aid in its diagnosis. The Studdiford criteria are a set of criteria used for diagnosing abdominal pregnancy. These criteria include: Absence of uterine pathology: The absence of any uterine abnormality that could explain the ectopic pregnancy, such as uterine rupture or previous uterine surgery. Demonstration of a live fetus or placental tissue within the abdomen: This can be confirmed through imaging techniques like ultrasound or MRI, which show the presence of the fetus or placenta outside the uterus. The fetus or placenta being separate from other abdominal organs: The fetus or placenta is not attached to any other abdominal organ and can be clearly differentiated from surrounding structures. The Spiegelberg criteria (Option A) are used for diagnosing tubal ectopic pregnancy, not abdominal pregnancy. The Rubin criteria (Option B) are also used for diagnosing tubal ectopic pregnancy, not abdominal pregnancy. The term \"ring of fire\" (Option D) is not a recognized criterion for diagnosing abdominal pregnancy. It may refer to the sensation of burning or intense pain felt during childbirth, particularly during the crowning stage.

So, a calf cramp can be relieved by dorsiflexing the foot while keeping the knee extended . This commonly suggested method usually offers quick relief from the cramp. Flexing the knee (bending the leg) and dorsiflexing the foot (Option B) may not provide relief for leg cramps. This position can actually exacerbate the cramping sensation by further contracting the muscles. While extending the knee is recommended, plantar flexing the foot (pointing the toes downwards) may not be effective in relieving leg cramps (Option C) . Plantar flexion primarily involves the calf muscles, which may not directly address the cramping muscles. Flexing the knee and plantar flexing the foot (Option D) may not provide relief for leg cramps. This position may even contribute to muscle tightness and increase discomfort.

      "explanation": "Correct Answer: B) Threatened abortion Explanation: The presence of vaginal bleeding in the first trimester along with a healthy fetus observed on USG, indicated by a well-formed gestation ring, central echoes from the embryo, and fetal cardiac motion, is characteristic of a threatened abortion. The cervix is typically closed in such cases, and the pregnancy may still continue successfully with appropriate care. Clinical Classification of Spontaneous Abortion Characteristic Threatened Inevitable (Option A) Incomplete (Option C) Complete (Option D) Missed Presentation Vaginal bleeding in < 20 weeks Vaginal bleeding or membrane rupture in < 20 weeks Expulsion of some products of conception Cervix closed after conception product expulsion No symptoms Cervical OS Closed Open Open Closed Closed USG Findings Normal intrauterine pregnancy with fetal heartbeat Dilated cervix with sac low in the uterine cavity or cervical canal Empty gestational sac or retained products of conception Empty uterus with no retained products of conception Absence of fetal heartbeat and/or absent growth of gestational sac Management Rest, monitor fetal viability Prepare for inevitable expulsion Evacuation of retained products of conception Observation Surgical evacuation or expectant management Reference: Williams Obstetrics, 26th Edition, Page: 200-202.",

        "A": "Pregnancy resulting from rape",
        "B": "When the family is large",
        "C": "Baby with serious mental or physical abnormality",
        "D": "Failure of contraceptives"
      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: B) When the family is large Explanation: When the family is large The size of the family alone is not a valid medical or legal indication for the termination of pregnancy. The decision for termination must be based on health risks, fetal abnormalities, or other more pressing medical or social factors, rather than family size Medical termination of pregnancy (MTP) is generally allowed for specific medical, social, or legal reasons. The criteria for MTP vary by jurisdiction. Medical Termination of Pregnancy (MTP) Act: The original act was passed in 1971 and amended in 2021. Indications : Maternal Risk Fetal Risk: Spina bifida, Down syndrome. (Option C) Eugenic Conditions: Risks to both mother and fetus. Humanitarian Cause: Pregnancy resulting from rape. (Option A) Contraceptive Failure. (Option D) Qualifications : MBBS, MD/DNB/DGO MBBS who has trained in gynaecology for 6 months MBBS who has performed 25 MTPs under supervision ASHA and AYUSH cannot perform MTP. Additions of 2021 amendment: Abortions allowed up to 20-24 weeks. <20 weeks - Single doctor’s decision; 20-24 weeks - 2 doctors. Extension of abortion rights to single, unmarried females. Inclusion of marital rape under the MTP Act. Abortions >24 weeks in cases of significant fetal anomalies with no gestational upper limit, are to be decided by a state medical board (gynecologist, pediatrician, radiologist). Gestational Age Abortive method Up to 7 weeks Medical Abortion. (99% success rate if done before 7 weeks) Up to 9 weeks Up to 10 weeks Medical Abortion Suction evacuation Up to 12 weeks Suction evacuation Dilatation and Curettage (D&C) 12-20 weeks Dilatation and Evacuation (D&E) 20-24 weeks Dilatation and Evacuation (D&E) Prostaglandin Induction. >24 weeks Hysterotomy Reference: Williams Obstetrics, 26th Edition, Page: 212.",

      "question": "Which of the following is true regarding UTI in pregnancy?",
      "options": {
        "A": "The prevalence of ASB is 50%",
        "B": "It is lower in people with sickle cell trait",
        "C": "The preferred antibiotic in pregnancy is amoxicillin",
        "D": "If ASB is not treated, 75% of them will develop symptomatic infection"
      },
      "correct_answer": "D",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: D) If ASB is not treated, 75% of them will develop symptomatic infection infections (UTIs), significantly increasing the risk of complications such as pyelonephritis, preterm labor, and low birth weight. Therefore, routine screening and prompt treatment of ASB during pregnancy are essential to ensure maternal and fetal well-being. Asymptomatic Bacteriuria (ASB) ≥ 10^5 CFU/mL of a single bacterium in urine without UTI symptoms. Causative organisms: E. coli, Klebsiella, Enterococcus, Proteus. Risk factors: Female sex, age, diabetes, pregnancy, urinary tract abnormalities, catheters, immunosuppressive conditions. Diagnosis: Urine culture: ≥ 10^5 CFU/mL without symptoms. Management: Pregnant women: Requires treatment (e.g., nitrofurantoin, amoxicillin). Non-pregnant women: Generally, no treatment unless symptomatic. Elderly and catheterized patients: Treatment is usually not recommended unless symptomatic. Complications: Pyelonephritis Preterm delivery Low birth weight Antibiotic resistance Prevention: Pregnancy screening at 12–16 weeks. The prevalence of ASB is 50% (Option A): The prevalence of ASB during pregnancy is not as high as 50%. It is typically estimated to be around 5-10%. It is lower in people with sickle cell trait (Option B): Sickle cell trait does not reduce the risk of UTIs in pregnancy. In fact, individuals with sickle cell trait may have a higher risk of developing infections due to compromised renal function. The preferred antibiotic in pregnancy is amoxicillin (Option C): While amoxicillin is safe in pregnancy and commonly used, the choice of antibiotics is guided by culture sensitivity results and local resistance patterns. Nitrofurantoin and cephalexin are also frequently used. Reference: Williams Obstetrics, 25th Edition, Page: 1026-1029.

      "explanation": "effectively stopping lactation. It is commonly used in cases where lactation suppression is needed, such as after Intrauterine fetal demise/death . Incorrect Options: Option B – Pramipexole: Pramipexole is also a dopamine agonist, but it is primarily used in the treatment of Parkinson's disease and restless legs syndrome, not for lactation suppression. Option C - Sumatriptan: Sumatriptan is a medication used to treat migraines by constricting blood vessels in the brain. It has no role in managing breast engorgement or lactation suppression. Option D - Metoclopramide: Metoclopramide is a medication used primarily for gastrointestinal issues, such as nausea and vomiting. While it has some prolactin-modulating effects, it is not the primary choice for suppressing lactation. Reference: .",
