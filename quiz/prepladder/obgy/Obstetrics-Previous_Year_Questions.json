      "explanation": "Correct Answer: D) 34 weeks Explanation: Early-onset pre-eclampsia is defined as pre-eclampsia that occurs before 34 weeks of gestation. Preeclampsia: Types of Preeclampsia: Early-Onset Preeclampsia: Occurs at <34 weeks gestation. Etiology: Defective placenta due to altered trophoblast invasion and placental ischemia. Features: Placental infarcts, arterial sclerosis, and hypoperfusion. Late-Onset Preeclampsia: Occurs at ≥ 34 weeks gestation. Etiology: Healthy placenta interacting with maternal factors, causing microvascular damage and endothelial dysfunction. Features: Maintained placental perfusion; managed expectantly until 37 weeks if stable. Clinical Presentations: New-onset headache unresponsive to medication. Visual disturbances. Right upper quadrant or epigastric pain, often with nausea or vomiting. Shortness of breath. Worsened swelling beyond baseline pregnancy-related symptoms. Physical Findings: Elevated blood pressure: SBP ≥ 140 mmHg or DBP ≥ 90 mmHg on two measurements at least 4 hours apart. Severe hypertension: SBP ≥ 160 mmHg or DBP ≥ 110 mmHg. Edema: Dependent (lower extremities) or independent (face, hands). Lung examination for pulmonary disturbances. Tenderness in the right upper quadrant or epigastric area. Laboratory Tests: Proteinuria: Urine dipstick ≥ 2+, 24-hour collection ≥ 300 mg, or protein/creatinine ratio ≥ 0.3. Thrombocytopenia: Platelet count <100 K/mm³. Impaired Liver Function: Liver enzymes >2 times the upper limit of normal. Renal Insufficiency: Serum creatinine ≥ 1.1 mg/dL or double baseline levels. Management: Antihypertensive Therapy: For severe hypertension (SBP ≥ 160 mmHg or DBP ≥ 110 mmHg): IV Medications: Labetalol, hydralazine. Oral Medications: Immediate-release nifedipine. For maintenance: PO Medications: Labetalol, extended-release nifedipine, or clonidine. Seizure Prophylaxis: First-Line: IV magnesium sulfate. Alternatives (if contraindicated): Levetiracetam or benzodiazepines for seizure treatment. Definitive Treatment: Delivery of the fetus is the only definitive cure. Delivery Timing: Gestational Hypertension or Preeclampsia without Severe Features: Deliver at 37 weeks. Severe Features at ≥ 34 weeks: Delivery after maternal stabilization. Severe Features <34 weeks: Expectant management with close monitoring and antenatal steroids for fetal lung maturation if stable. Reference: Williams Obstetrics, 26th Edition, Page 689,690",

      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: A) Term and preterm babies irrespective of birth weights Explanation: Delayed cord clamping is done in term and preterm babies, irrespective of birth weight. Delayed Umbilical Cord Clamping: Timing Recommended delay: At least 30-60 seconds after birth for vigorous term and preterm infants (per ACOG). Benefits for Term Infants Increased Hemoglobin Levels: Higher levels at birth. Improved Iron Stores: Better reserves during the first several months of life. Positive Developmental Impact: Potential improvement in neurodevelopmental outcomes. Benefits for Preterm Infants Improved Circulation: Enhanced transitional circulation to support physiological adaptation. Higher RBC Volume: Better blood volume establishment. Reduced Complications: Lower rates of necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC). Reduced incidence of intraventricular hemorrhage (IVH). Decreased Need for Blood Transfusions: Fewer transfusions required in neonatal care. Maternal Safety No significant increase in postpartum hemorrhage or blood loss. No differences in postpartum hemoglobin levels or the need for maternal transfusion.

      "options": {
        "A": "Increase in systolic and diastolic blood pressure after 6 weeks",
        "B": "Peripheral resistance to insulin leading to hyperinsulinemia",
        "C": "Fasting hypoglycemia and postprandial hyperglycemia",
        "D": "Increased plasma volume and RBC mass"
      },
      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: A) Increase in systolic and diastolic blood pressure after 6 weeks Explanation: In pregnancy, an increase in systolic and diastolic blood pressure after 6 weeks is not a physiological change. Blood Pressure in Pregnancy: Declines early in pregnancy, reaching a nadir at 24-26 weeks; diastolic pressure decreases more than systolic. Positional Changes: BP is lower in lateral positions compared to sitting or supine positions. Supine Hypotensive Syndrome: Uterus compresses great vessels, causing significant hypotension in some women. Blood Volume in Pregnancy: Hypervolemia: Blood volume increases by 40-45% above nonpregnant levels by 32-34 weeks of gestation. In some cases, blood volume nearly doubles. Plasma and Erythrocyte Mass: Plasma volume increases more than erythrocyte mass. Erythrocyte volume increases by ~450 mL due to moderate bone marrow erythroid hyperplasia and elevated plasma erythropoietin levels. (Option D) Hemoglobin and Hematocrit: Hemoglobin concentration decreases slightly, averaging 12.5 g/dL at term. Metabolic Changes in Pregnancy: Glucose Levels: Characterized by mild fasting hypoglycemia, postprandial hyperglycemia, and hyperinsulinemia. (Option B) Insulin Sensitivity: Reduced by 30-70% in late pregnancy due to: Hormones: Progesterone, cortisol, placentally derived growth hormone, and prolactin. Cytokines: Tumor necrosis factor and leptin. Postprandial Glucose: Elevated due to insulin resistance and augmented hepatic gluconeogenesis. Fasting State: (OptionC) Lower glucose and amino acids. Higher free fatty acids, triglycerides, and cholesterol. Ketonemia develops rapidly during prolonged fasting. Reference: Williams Obstetrics, 26th Edition, Page 57,59,60,64,65",

      "options": {
        "A": "Passive movement of head due to untwisting of neck",
        "B": "Movement of the head by 1/8th of the circle due to torsion",

      },
      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: A) Passive movement of head due to untwisting of neck Explanation: Restitution is the passive movement of head due to untwisting of neck. Restitution: It is the repositioning of the fetal head attitude immediately after delivery, returning it to normal alignment with the body. It involves visible external movement of the fetal head to correct the torsion of the neck sustained during internal rotation. The direction of this movement is opposite to that of internal rotation (45°). This movement allows the head to align with the shoulders, with the occiput pointing towards the maternal thigh of the corresponding side where it originally lies. As restitution occurs, the fetal head reaches a transverse position, and the fetal body aligns its bisacromial diameter (the distance across the shoulders) with the anteroposterior diameter of the pelvic outlet. As a result, one shoulder moves anteriorly, positioning behind the symphysis, while the other shoulder moves posteriorly.

      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: C) Bimanual compression Explanation: Bimanual compression is not a part of AMTSL. Active Management of the Third Stage of Labor (AMTSL): AMTSL is a set of practices aimed at enhancing uterine contractions to facilitate placental delivery and prevent primary postpartum hemorrhage (PPH). Key Steps: Administration of Uterotonic Medication: (Option D) A uterotonic drug, such as oxytocin, is administered within one minute of the baby's birth or immediately after the delivery of the anterior shoulder. Significance : This is the most critical step in promoting uterine contractions and reducing bleeding. Delayed Cord Clamping: The umbilical cord is clamped and cut 1–3 minutes after the baby is delivered. Purpose : Optimizes neonatal blood volume and reduces the risk of anemia. Controlled Cord Traction (CCT): (Option B) The placenta is delivered using a modified technique ( Brandt-Andrews method ), involving gentle pulling on the cord while supporting the uterus. Benefit : Helps prevent uterine inversion and ensures safe placental delivery. Assessment of Uterine Tone : Intermittently check the uterine fundus to confirm adequate tone and contractility. Routine uterine massage (Option A) is no longer universally recommended but may be performed if needed.

      "explanation": "contraindicated in obstructed labor because the fetus cannot be safely delivered vaginally due to cephalopelvic disproportion or other causes of obstruction. Applying forceps in such cases may lead to maternal and fetal complications like uterine rupture or birth trauma. Instrument Description Piper forceps Asymmetrical blades (one solid, one fenestrated) Specifically for the after-coming head in breech deliveries. Allows application when access to the fetal head is limited. Designed for quick delivery of head-in breech births It has distinct perineal curve, allows for application to the aftercoming head in breech delivery. (Option C) Simpson forceps Long, curved blades.

      },
      "correct_answer": "D",
      "explanation": "Correct answer: D) Adnexal mass with empty uterus and fluid in pelvis Explanation: Tubal (ectopic) pregnancy occurs when a fertilized ovum implants outside the uterine cavity, most commonly in the fallopian tube. The characteristic ultrasound findings suggestive of a tubal pregnancy include: Adnexal mass – Represents the ectopic pregnancy, often seen as a tubal ring or a gestational sac outside the uterus. Empty uterus – Absence of an intrauterine gestational sac despite a positive pregnancy test. Fluid in the pelvis – Suggests hemoperitoneum due to rupture or bleeding from the ectopic site. Ovarian mass with single layer of endometrium (Option A) suggests an ovarian pathology (e.g., corpus luteum cyst), not tubal pregnancy. Adnexal mass with empty uterus (Option B) : While this is suggestive, the presence of fluid in the pelvis increases suspicion of rupture. Trilayer endometrium without adnexal mass (Option C) : A trilaminar endometrium is seen in normal early pregnancy or luteal phase and does not indicate an ectopic pregnancy.

        "D": "Non Stress test"
      },
      "correct_answer": "D",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: D) Non Stress test Explanation: The NST is a non-invasive, quick, and reliable method to assess fetal heart rate response to fetal movements, which is crucial given the reported decrease in fetal movements. During an NST, the mother is placed in a comfortable position, and external monitors are attached to her abdomen to record the fetal heart rate and any fetal movements for 20 minutes. A reactive NST (presence of accelerations in fetal heart rate with movements) indicates good fetal health, while a non-reactive NST (lack of sufficient accelerations) may necessitate further testing or intervention. Antepartum fetal surveillance: Fetal movement Maternal observation and recording of fetal movements to assess fetal well-being and activity levels. Non-stress test (NST) Monitors fetal heart rate acceleration in response to fetal movements to assess fetal well-being. Biophysical profile (BPP) (Option B ruled out) Assesses fetal well-being based on fetal heart rate accelerations, fetal movements, muscle tone, breathing movements, and amniotic fluid volume Doppler velocimetry Uses ultrasound to assess blood flow in fetal vessels like umbilical artery,middle cerebral artery (MCA), and ductus venosus aiding in the evaluation of fetal well-being and placental function Amniotic fluid index (AFI) (Option A ruled out) Measures the depth of amniotic fluid to assess fetal well-being and detect potential complications like oligohydramnios or polyhydramnios Contraction stress test (CST) (Option C ruled out) Evaluates fetal heart rate response to uterine contractions to assess fetal well-being and uteroplacental function under controlled stress conditions. BPP, CST, AFI are not the initial tests that are performed as they are either invasive ( CST) or time consuming ( BPP ) or do not properly tell us about fetal movements ( AFI ).

      },
      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "β -hCG after 48 hours β -hCG after 48 hours Explanation: In a hemodynamically stable patient, when β -hCG levels are below the discriminatory zone (<1,500–2,000 IU/L) and ultrasound findings are inconclusive, the next step is to repeat β -hCG testing after 48 hours to assess the trend. A doubling β -hCG level suggests a normal intrauterine pregnancy. A plateauing or declining β -hCG raises suspicion of an ectopic pregnancy or early pregnancy loss. Investigations for ectopic pregnancy: Blood examination should be done as a routine for: Haemoglobin ABO and Rh grouping Total white cell count and differential count Erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) Estimation of β -hCG: The suspicious findings are: Lower concentration of β -hCG compared to normal intrauterine pregnancy Plasma concentration does not double in 48 hours like in normal pregnancy Sonography (TVS): The diagnostic features are: Absence of intrauterine pregnancy with a positive pregnancy test. Fluid (echogenic) in the pouch of Douglas. Adnexal mass clearly separated from the ovary (Blob sign). Rarely cardiac motion may be seen in an unruptured tubal ectopic pregnancy. Combination of quantitative β -hCG values and sonography: TVS provides visualization of a well-formed intrauterine gestational sac as early as 4–5 weeks from the last menstrual period. The lowest level of serum β -hCG at which a gestational sac is consistently visible using TVS (discriminatory zone) is ≥ 1,500 IU/L. So if the beta-hCG level is ≥ 1,500 and no intrauterine pregnancy is seen, an ectopic pregnancy is highly suspected. Laparoscopy offers benefits in cases of confusion with other pelvic lesions. Dilatation and curettage: Identification of decidua without villi structure is suggestive. Serum progesterone: A level greater than 25 ng/mL is suggestive of viable intrauterine pregnancy whereas a level less than 5 ng/mL suggests an ectopic or abnormal intrauterine pregnancy. Laparotomy offers benefits when in doubt. Laparoscopy (Option A) is reserved for cases with significant clinical suspicion of ectopic pregnancy or instability. Methotrexate therapy (Option B) is initiated only after a confirmed diagnosis of ectopic pregnancy. Dilatation and curettage (Option D) is used when miscarriage is suspected and histological confirmation is needed. Reference: DC Dutta Textbook of Obstetrics, 9th Edition, Page 172",

      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: C) Vigorous fundal massage combined with a uterotonic agent Explanation: Vigorous fundal massage helps to maintain uterine tone and prevent uterine atony, a common cause of postpartum hemorrhage. Combining it with a uterotonic agent like oxytocin further enhances uterine contraction, reducing the risk of excessive bleeding. Active Management of the Third Stage of Labor (AMTSL) for PPH Uterine Massage Always palpate the uterine fundus after placental delivery. Vigorous fundal massage, combined with a uterotonic agent, is recommended to prevent PPH due to uterine atony. During immediate PPH, perform uterine massage while evaluating for other bleeding sources and administering uterotonic agents. Oxytocin Recommended by WHO as a first-line prophylactic treatment for postpartum hemorrhage. Administer 20 units of oxytocin in 1,000 mL of crystalloid solution intravenously at 10 mL/min for a dose of 200 mU/min. Never administer oxytocin as an undiluted bolus due to risks of severe hypotension or cardiac arrhythmias. (Option A) Intravenous oxytocin is also a first-line treatment for uterine atony. Oxytocin 10 units can be given IM with the delivery of the anterior shoulder (Option B) Delayed Cord Clamping/Controlled Cord Traction (CCT) If placental separation is evident, perform expression via fundal pressure or controlled cord traction. If the placenta is not separated, perform manual removal under general anaesthesia. Delivery of the placenta by cord traction before placental separation especially in an atonic uterus may cause uterine inversion.

While this is a concerning sign, depending on the overall clinical assessment, treatment should be carefully monitored rather than immediately stopped. Incorrect Options: Option A - Respiratory rate (RR) < 18 breaths per minute: Magnesium sulfate toxicity can cause respiratory depression. A respiratory rate below 14 breaths per minute is a critical sign that the magnesium levels may be too high, warranting the cessation of the treatment and administration of calcium gluconate as an antidote. Option B - Visual disturbances start: Visual disturbances are a symptom of worsening preeclampsia or impending eclampsia rather than a sign of magnesium toxicity. Therefore, it would not indicate stopping the Pritchard regimen but might require further management of preeclampsia. Option C - Knee jerk reflex is present: The presence of the knee jerk (patellar) reflex indicates that magnesium levels are within a safe range. The absence of this reflex (areflexia) would indicate potential toxicity. Thus, a present knee-jerk reflex does not necessitate stopping the treatment.",

Incorrect Options: Option A - Warfarin: Warfarin is a vitamin K antagonist and is contraindicated during pregnancy, especially in the third trimester, due to its teratogenic effects and risk of fetal bleeding. Warfarin can cross the placenta and may cause fetal complications such as fetal warfarin syndrome and intracranial hemorrhage. Option C - Apixaban: Apixaban is a direct oral anticoagulant (DOAC) that is not recommended during pregnancy due to limited data on its safety and the risk of placental transfer. It is not typically used in pregnant women. Option D - Enoxaparin: Enoxaparin is a low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) and is safe during most of the pregnancy.

Incorrect Options: Option B - Immediate induction : Induction at 37 weeks without managing the anticoagulation could pose significant risks due to potential bleeding complications. Anticoagulation should be carefully managed before considering induction, making this option inappropriate as the first step. Option C - LSCS (Lower Segment Caesarean Section) : An elective caesarean section would require careful planning, including discontinuing warfarin and possibly switching to LMWH beforehand to manage bleeding risks.

      "explanation": "delivery in cases where there is a risk of transmission of infections or complications during vaginal delivery. For a pregnant woman with active genital ulcers, LSCS is recommended to avoid the risk of transmission of the infection to the newborn during passage through the birth canal, which could potentially cause neonatal infection or other complications. Incorrect Options: Option B - Classic Caesarean Section : A Classic Caesarean Section involves making an incision in the upper part of the uterus. This method is less commonly used today due to increased risk of complications and longer recovery time compared to LSCS. It is typically reserved for specific obstetric indications where LSCS is not feasible. Option C - Vaginal Delivery : Vaginal delivery is generally avoided in the presence of active genital ulcers because the risk of transmitting the infection to the baby during delivery is high. Genital ulcers can be associated with infections like herpes simplex virus (HSV), which can lead to severe neonatal complications if transmitted during vaginal delivery. Option D - Induction of Labour : Induction of labor is a procedure used to start labor artificially. In the presence of active genital ulcers, inducing labor is not recommended due to the increased risk of complications and the potential for infection transmission to the newborn.",

Misoprostol : This is a prostaglandin analog that induces uterine contractions and helps expel the contents of the uterus. It is used after mifepristone to complete the abortion process. Usage : This combination is widely used for medical abortion up to 10 weeks gestation and is considered safe and effective. Incorrect Options: Option B - Dinoprost : Dinoprost : This is a prostaglandin used to induce labor and terminate pregnancies. However, it is typically used in the second trimester rather than at 10 weeks POG. It is less commonly used compared to misoprostol for early medical abortion. Option C - Oxytocin : Oxytocin : This is a hormone used to induce labor by stimulating uterine contractions. It is not used for early medical abortion and is generally reserved for labor induction or management of postpartum hemorrhage. Option D - Intrauterine Hyperosmolar Saline : Intrauterine Hyperosmolar Saline : This is an older method of abortion used in the second trimester and involves injecting a hyperosmolar saline solution into the amniotic sac.

      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: C) Low-segment transverse incision Explanation: Low-segment transverse incision has the lowest risk for uterine rupture during trial of labor after cesarean (TOLAC). Incision location : Lower uterine segment Direction : Horizontal (transverse) Healing characteristics : Better wound healing Scar strength : Superior to classical incision Clinical Significance: Lower rupture risk during subsequent pregnancies Better healing due to less contractile portion of uterus Preferred technique for primary cesarean sections Favorable for future TOLAC Classical C section (Option A): This vertical incision through the contractile portion of the uterus carries a significantly higher risk of uterine rupture (4-9%) during TOLAC. The location and direction of this incision make it a contraindication for future vaginal delivery attempts. Pre-eclampsia (Option B): This is a medical condition that affects pregnancy but has no direct relationship to the type of uterine incision or TOLAC risk. Pre-eclampsia is a separate consideration in pregnancy management and doesn't inherently affect TOLAC decision-making. Breech presentation (Option D): This refers to fetal positioning and is not related to the type of uterine incision or its associated risks in TOLAC. While breech presentation may influence delivery decisions, it doesn't directly impact the risk of uterine rupture during TOLAC.

Inducing contractions in such cases can lead to the separation of the placenta from the uterine wall, causing potentially life-threatening hemorrhage. Incorrect Option Option B - Gestational Hypertension (HTN) : Induction of labor can be considered in cases of gestational hypertension if there is concern about maternal or fetal well-being. However, the decision depends on the severity of hypertension and other clinical factors. Induction might be recommended to avoid complications associated with prolonged hypertension, but it can be managed on a case-by-case basis. Option C - PROM (Premature Rupture of Membranes) : PROM refers to the rupture of the amniotic sac before the onset of labor. Induction of labor is often considered when PROM occurs to reduce the risk of infection to the mother and fetus due to the prolonged rupture of membranes. The timing of induction in such cases depends on various factors, including gestational age, maternal and fetal health, and the presence of infection. Option D - Abruptio Placenta : Abruptio placenta is a condition where the placenta prematurely separates from the uterine wall before delivery. Depending on the severity of the detachment and the stability of both the mother and the fetus, induction might be considered as part of the management plan. However, cases of significant abruptio placenta might necessitate emergency delivery via cesarean section rather than induction.",

The medical decisions related to fetal conditions are typically made based on the mother's consent and medical opinions. Option C - Opinion of 2 doctors: While seeking the opinion of two doctors is an important aspect of medical decision-making, it alone is not sufficient. Consent from the pregnant woman (mother) is crucial, as she holds the right to make decisions about her own body and pregnancy. The involvement of the woman's consent in addition to medical opinions is necessary.

The combination of high blood pressure, proteinuria, and pedal edema in this case is indicative of pre-eclampsia. Incorrect Options: Option B - Abruptio Placenta: Abruptio placenta is a condition where the placenta detaches from the uterine wall before delivery, causing bleeding and abdominal pain. It is associated with a painful abdomen and sometimes bleeding. While high blood pressure can be a risk factor for placental abruption, the presence of pedal edema and proteinuria is more suggestive of pre-eclampsia. Option C - PPH (Postpartum Hemorrhage): PPH refers to excessive bleeding following childbirth.

      "explanation": "commonly used in various medical conditions. These medications work by suppressing the release of gonadotropins, which are hormones that stimulate the production of sex hormones in the body. In certain conditions, a non-pulsatile dose of GnRH agonist is used, meaning a continuous or sustained dose is administered. Incorrect Options: Here is an explanation of the options: Option A . Endometriosis: GnRH agonists are used in the treatment of endometriosis to reduce the symptoms and growth of endometrial tissue outside the uterus. The non-pulsatile dose of GnRH agonist helps suppress the production of estrogen and provides relief from pain and other symptoms associated with endometriosis. Option C . Precocious puberty: Precocious puberty refers to the early onset of puberty before the age of 9 in girls and 10 in boys. GnRH agonists are used in the treatment of precocious puberty to delay further pubertal development. The continuous or non-pulsatile administration of GnRH agonist helps suppress the premature release of sex hormones and slows down the progression of puberty. OptionD . Carcinoma prostate: GnRH agonists are commonly used in the treatment of advanced prostate cancer. These medications help suppress the production of testosterone, which can fuel the growth of prostate cancer cells. The non-pulsatile dose of GnRH agonist is used to maintain a continuous suppression of testosterone levels and inhibit the growth of prostate cancer. Reference: DC dutta , textbook of obstetrics",

Incorrect Options: Option A - Pituitary failure: A low FSH (follicle-stimulating hormone) level, as in this case (FSH 7 mIU/mL), suggests that the pituitary is responding appropriately to the low estrogen levels. Pituitary failure is less likely in this context. Option B - Ovarian failure: Ovarian failure typically results in elevated FSH levels due to a lack of negative feedback from estrogen. A low FSH level makes ovarian failure less likely. Option D - Pregnancy: Pregnancy would generally be associated with a rise in FSH levels. A low FSH level makes pregnancy less likely. In summary, the likely diagnosis in this case of secondary amenorrhea with a history of curettage for abortion and a normal FSH level is Uterine synechiae",

Intermittent Pneumatic Compression (IPC) devices do not deliver a continuous flow of air. Instead, they work by applying periodic pressure and release cycles to the legs through inflatable cuffs. They apply periodic pressure and release cycles to the legs using inflatable cuffs: This is the correct answer. IPC devices consist of inflatable cuffs that are placed around the legs. These cuffs inflate and deflate in a cyclical manner to help mimic the natural pumping action of the calf muscles. This helps improve venous blood flow, prevent stasis, and reduce the risk of deep vein thrombosis (DVT). They administer medication through subcutaneous injections to prevent blood clot formation: This option is not accurate. IPC devices do not administer medication. They work solely by applying mechanical pressure to aid in improving blood circulation and preventing blood clot formation. They use heat therapy to improve blood flow and prevent clot formation: This option is not accurate. While heat therapy can help improve blood flow, IPC devices primarily work through mechanical pressure and the cyclic inflation and deflation of cuffs, which aids in enhancing venous return and reducing the risk of DVT.

The patient usually presents with painless, causeless, recurrent bleeding which is bright red in color. On abdominal examination, the uterus is felt soft and relaxed, fetal heart sounds will be usually present. Smoking can cause hypertrophy/increase in the size of the placenta to compensate for reduced oxygenation caused due to carbon monoxide. Option C - Hydramnios: Polyhydramnios is a condition where excess collection of liquor amnii is more than 2000 ml. However, there is no definitive link between smoking and development of polyhydramnios. Option D - Preterm labor: Smoking has a close association with preterm labour by reducing the flow of blood and oxygen to the growing fetus. Often children born to smoking mothers weigh lesser compared to normal babies. In this case scenario, the patient will have regular uterine contractions one in every 10 minutes, cervix dilatation > 2 cm with 80% effacement, vaginal bleeding or discharge will be present.

      "explanation": "risk of developing bleeding. Low molecular weight heparins have lesser chances of bleeding compared to warfarin. They have a longer half-life hence once daily dose is sufficient. Incorrect Options: Option B - Stop warfarin and start aspirin: Aspirin in high doses during the last trimester can result in premature closure of ductus arteriosus, pulmonary hypertension, and kernicterus in the baby. Hence, it is generally avoided during pregnancy. Option C - Continue warfarin: Since this patient’s INR is around 3, it is better to stop warfarin since the chances of bleeding is known to be high. Warfarin can cross the placenta cause fetal complications like embryopathy, nasal hypoplasia, mental retardation, microcephaly, bone stiplings, and optic atrophy.Hence, it is advised to stop warfarin and switch to other safer anticoagulants like low-molecular weight heparin. Option D - Stop warfarin, star LMWH and aspirin: Starting two anticoagulants simultaneously can increase the chances of maternal bleeds and can cause life threatening complications to both the mother and the baby. Hence, it is ideally not recommended. Reference: .",

      "explanation": "Propylthiouracil is considered safe during pregnancy. Both methimazole and propylthiouracil are frequently used during pregnancy. However, methimazole is avoided during the first trimester since it is known to cause embryopathy. These drugs work by inhibiting the production of thyroid hormones hence controlling hyperthyroidism. Incorrect Choices Option B: Methimazole: Methimazole is known to cause embryopathy; hence it is avoided during the first trimester and can cause aplasia cutis in the newborn. Option C: Carbimazole: Carbimazole is an inactive prodrug. Hence, it is converted to methimazole within the body. It is usually given at a dose of 10-40 mg daily. Carbimazole is similarly not recommended during pregnancy as it is known to cause congenital fetal abnormalities like aplasia cutis (Absence of skin) or fetal hypothyroidism. Option D: Radioactive iodine: It is avoided during pregnancy as it is potentially harmful to the growing fetus.

However, unlike preexisting diabetes (Type 1 or Type 2), GDM is not associated with fetal malformations. Correct Options: Option B. Polyhydramnios: Polyhydramnios, which refers to an excessive accumulation of amniotic fluid, is a potential complication of GDM. High blood sugar levels in the mother can lead to increased production of urine by the fetus, resulting in polyhydramnios. Option C. Fetal Macrosomia: Fetal macrosomia, which refers to a larger-than-average baby, is commonly associated with GDM. When blood sugar levels are high in the mother, the fetus receives excess glucose, leading to increased growth and potential macrosomia. Option D. Neonatal Hypoglycemia: Neonatal hypoglycemia, or low blood sugar levels in the newborn, is a common complication of GDM. When a baby is exposed to high levels of glucose in the womb, their pancreas produces more insulin to metabolize the excess glucose. After birth, when the supply of maternal glucose is suddenly removed, the baby's blood sugar levels can drop, resulting in neonatal hypoglycemia. Reference: .",

The risk of FVS is highest when maternal infection occurs between the 13th and 20th weeks of pregnancy. Incorrect Options: Option A. 6 to 10 weeks: While varicella infection during the early weeks of pregnancy can pose risks to the developing fetus, the highest risk period for FVS is considered to be between 13 and 20 weeks. The organogenesis (formation of organs) stage occurs predominantly during this time, making it a critical period for fetal development. Option B. 8 to 12 weeks: Similar to the explanation for option A, the risk of FVS is highest between 13 and 20 weeks. The 8 to 12 week period is also important for fetal development, but the peak risk period for FVS occurs slightly later. Option D. 20 to 28 weeks: While varicella infection during the later stages of pregnancy can still pose risks to the fetus, the risk of FVS is highest during the 13 to 20 week timeframe.

When a pregnant woman is infected with Parvovirus B19, it can cross the placenta and infect the developing fetus. In some cases, this can lead to the development of Hydrops fetalis. Incorrect Options: Option A. CMV (Cytomegalovirus): While CMV infection is a common viral infection that can be transmitted from mother to fetus, it is not a primary cause of Hydrops fetalis. CMV infection during pregnancy can result in other complications, such as hearing loss, developmental delays, and microcephaly, but it is not specifically associated with Hydrops fetalis. Option C.

Breast milk provides all the necessary nutrients, antibodies, and enzymes that are crucial for the baby's growth, development, and immune system. It offers numerous health benefits to both the baby and the mother. Breastfed babies have a lower risk of infections, respiratory illnesses, allergies, and chronic diseases later in life. Breastfeeding also promotes bonding between the mother and the baby and has positive effects on the mother's health, including reducing the risk of breast and ovarian cancers. Breast milk provides all the necessary nutrients, antibodies, and enzymes that are crucial for the baby's growth, development, and immune system.Continuing breastfeeding beyond 6 months is also highly recommended. The WHO recommends continuing breastfeeding along with appropriate complementary feeding until at least 2 years of age or beyond. Incorrect Options: Option B: 2 months: Breastfeeding for only 2 months is not recommended as it falls short of the recommended minimum duration.

Forceful traction of the umbilical cord during attempts to remove the placenta can lead to complications. Uterine inversion is the most common and significant complication that can occur due to forceful traction of the cord. It happens when the placenta is forcefully pulled before it has detached from the uterine wall, causing the uterus to turn inside out or partially inside out. Uterine inversion is a medical emergency that requires immediate attention. It can lead to severe bleeding, shock, and compromise the blood supply to the uterus, which can be life-threatening. Incorrect Options: Option A: Hemorrhage: Hemorrhage, or excessive bleeding, can be a complication of retained placenta but is not directly caused by forceful traction of the cord. When the placenta remains attached, it prevents the uterus from contracting properly, leading to blood vessel bleeding. However, forceful cord traction is more specifically associated with uterine inversion rather than hemorrhage. Option C: Uterine rupture: Uterine rupture is a rare but serious complication during childbirth, where there is a tear or separation in the uterine wall. It can be caused by factors such as previous uterine surgery, excessive uterine distention, or abnormal contractions. Forceful traction of the cord is not typically associated with uterine rupture. Option D: Placenta retraction: Placenta retraction refers to the process where the placenta separates and moves upwards into the uterine cavity after delivery. It is a natural phenomenon that occurs due to uterine contractions and helps to prevent postpartum hemorrhage. Forceful traction of the cord does not cause placenta retraction. However, retained placenta can hinder the process of placenta retraction. Reference: .",

      "explanation": "is essential to take appropriate measures to prevent vertical transmission of the virus to the newborn. The management of the neonate includes administering both the Hepatitis B vaccine and Hepatitis B immune globulin (HBIG) for optimal protection. Hepatitis B vaccine is a safe and effective vaccine that provides active immunity against the Hepatitis B virus. It stimulates the baby's immune system to produce antibodies against the virus, reducing the risk of infection. Hepatitis B immune globulin (HBIG) is a concentrated solution of antibodies obtained from individuals with high levels of antibodies against Hepatitis B. It provides passive immunity by giving the baby ready-made antibodies against the virus. HBIG provides immediate protection until the baby's own immune response develops after receiving the vaccine series. Incorrect Options: Option A: Hepatitis B vaccine only: Administering the Hepatitis B vaccine alone without HBIG is not sufficient in this scenario. The newborn is at risk of acquiring the infection from the mother during delivery, and the vaccine alone may not provide adequate protection. Option C: First HBIG, then Hepatitis B vaccine after 1 month: Delaying the administration of the Hepatitis B vaccine for one month is not recommended. Immediate protection is needed to prevent the transmission of the virus. Giving HBIG alone without the vaccine does not confer long-term immunity. Option D: Only HBIG: Administering only HBIG without the Hepatitis B vaccine is not recommended. HBIG provides temporary passive immunity, but it does not induce a lasting immune response. The Hepatitis B vaccine is necessary to stimulate the baby's immune system to produce its own protective antibodies.",

      "explanation": "passageway that forms between the bladder and the vagina. It can occur as a complication of childbirth, particularly in cases of uterine fetal death. The prolonged pressure of the fetus on the birth canal can lead to tissue necrosis and subsequent formation of a fistula. In this scenario, the woman has experienced uterine fetal death after a normal vaginal delivery. The continued passage of urine from the vagina indicates an abnormal communication between the bladder and the vagina, which is characteristic of a vesicovaginal fistula. This condition results in the leakage of urine from the bladder into the vagina, leading to urinary incontinence. Incorrect Options: Option A: Bladder rupture: Bladder rupture is a rare and severe complication that involves a complete tear or rupture of the bladder wall. It is typically associated with significant trauma or injury to the bladder, such as from a pelvic fracture or severe abdominal trauma. In this case, there is no indication of such traumatic events, making bladder rupture less likely. Option C: Urge incontinence: Urge incontinence is a form of urinary incontinence characterized by a strong, sudden urge to urinate, followed by involuntary urine leakage. It is typically caused by an overactive bladder or neurological conditions affecting bladder control. However, in this case, the continuous passage of urine from the vagina suggests a structural abnormality, such as a fistula, rather than urge incontinence. Option D: Stress incontinence: Stress incontinence occurs when physical activities or movements, such as coughing, sneezing, or exercising, put pressure on the bladder and cause urine leakage. It is commonly seen in women with weakened pelvic floor muscles. However, stress incontinence does not involve the passage of urine through the vagina, as seen in this case.",

      "explanation": "found beneficial. Generally, the mechanism of MgSO4 is by decreasing pinocytosis caused by acute hypertension and thus also restricting the movement of water into the brain and thereby limiting the oedema component and improving the eclampsia features. Incorrect Options: Option A: Labetalol: Labetalol is a medication used to lower blood pressure. While controlling hypertension is important in the management of eclampsia, it is not the first-line treatment for preventing seizures. In this case, the patient has already experienced convulsions, so blood pressure control alone would not be sufficient. Option C: Termination: Termination of the pregnancy is not the immediate management for eclampsia. While delivery may be necessary in some cases, the primary focus initially is on stabilizing the patient and preventing further seizures. Delivery may be considered if the condition of the mother or the baby deteriorates or if the pregnancy is at or near term. Option D: Clonidine: Clonidine is a medication primarily used to treat high blood pressure. However, it is not the preferred treatment for eclampsia and does not have the same anticonvulsant properties as magnesium sulfate. Reference: .",

      "correct_answer": "D",
      "explanation": "likely due to a condition called postpartum hemorrhage (PPH). PPH is defined as blood loss exceeding 500 mL after vaginal delivery or 1000 mL after a cesarean section. It is a significant obstetric emergency that requires immediate attention. Incorrect options: Option A: Estrogen: Estrogen plays a crucial role in preparing the uterus for pregnancy and maintaining the endometrial lining. However, it is not directly involved in causing excessive bleeding after placenta removal. Estrogen levels naturally rise during pregnancy but decrease after delivery. Option B: Progesterone: Progesterone is a hormone that supports the development of the uterine lining and helps maintain pregnancy. Similar to estrogen, progesterone levels decrease after delivery. While progesterone withdrawal can trigger the onset of menstruation, it is not typically associated with excessive bleeding after placenta removal. Option C: FSH and LH: Follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) and luteinizing hormone (LH) are pituitary hormones that regulate the menstrual cycle and ovulation. After delivery, there is a sudden drop in progesterone levels, which leads to the removal of the hormonal inhibition on FSH and LH release. This hormonal imbalance can cause increased uterine contractions, leading to excessive bleeding.",

      "explanation": "Laparotomy: This option is the correct diagnosis based on the given information. A previous C-section increases the risk of uterine scar rupture in subsequent pregnancies. Symptoms such as low blood pressure, tachycardia, and the presence of fluid in the peritoneum on ultrasound indicate a potential uterine rupture. Laparotomy, an open surgical procedure, is the appropriate next step for immediate evaluation and intervention. Incorrect Options: Option B: Laparoscopy: While laparoscopy is a minimally invasive surgical procedure, it is not the appropriate next step in this case. Uterine scar rupture is a serious condition that requires immediate attention, and a laparotomy is more suitable for a thorough evaluation and surgical intervention. Option C: Ectopic pregnancy and abortion: Ectopic pregnancy, where the fertilized egg implants outside the uterus, is less likely in this scenario. At 36 weeks of pregnancy, an ectopic pregnancy is highly unlikely. The symptoms described, along with the history of a previous C-section, are more suggestive of a uterine scar rupture. Option D: PID (Pelvic Inflammatory Disease): PID is an infection of the female reproductive organs, typically caused by sexually transmitted bacteria.

The bleeding may be accompanied by abdominal pain or cramping. In this scenario, the presence of a live fetus on ultrasound and a closed internal OS suggests that the pregnancy is still ongoing. Close monitoring and follow-up are necessary to determine the outcome of the pregnancy. Incorrect options: Option B: Complete Abortion: In a complete abortion, the products of conception (fetus and placenta) have been completely expelled from the uterus. The bleeding would typically be heavier, and the presence of a live fetus on ultrasound and a closed internal OS would not be expected. Option C: Incomplete Abortion: In an incomplete abortion, only a portion of the products of conception has been expelled, while some remain in the uterus.

It involves the separation of the placenta from the uterine wall, leading to bleeding and potential fetal distress. An emergency cesarean section (CS) is the appropriate treatment to ensure the prompt delivery of the baby and control any further complications. Incorrect Options: Option A: Placenta previa and Suction and evacuation: Placenta previa occurs when the placenta partially or completely covers the cervix. It typically presents with painless vaginal bleeding, rather than pain, and the absence of fetal heart rate is not a characteristic finding. Suction and evacuation, also known as dilation and curettage, is not the appropriate treatment for placenta previa. Option C: Obstructed labour and CS: Obstructed labor refers to mechanical obstruction preventing the fetus from passing through the birth canal. While it can cause pain and absence of fetal heart rate, the presence of hematuria is not typically associated with obstructed labor. Additionally, the management of obstructed labor would involve a cesarean section, but the cause of obstruction is different in this case. Option D: Placenta accreta/increta/percreta: Placenta accreta, increta, or percreta refers to the abnormal attachment of the placenta to the uterine wall.

Glycogen serves as a source of nutrients for Lactobacilli, helping them to maintain a healthy vaginal environment. Incorrect options: Option A) Decreased number of Lactobacilli: This statement is incorrect. Lactobacilli are the dominant bacteria found in a healthy vagina, and they play a crucial role in maintaining a slightly acidic pH and preventing the overgrowth of harmful bacteria. During pregnancy, the number of Lactobacilli tends to remain stable or may even increase. Option C) pH > 6.8: This statement is incorrect. In a normal pregnancy, the vaginal pH remains acidic, typically below 4.5, rather than becoming alkaline or having a pH greater than 6.8. The presence of Lactobacilli, which produces lactic acid, helps maintain the acidic pH of the vagina and provides a protective barrier against potential infections. Option D) Epithelial thinning: This statement is incorrect. In a normal pregnancy, the vaginal epithelium undergoes certain changes to adapt to hormonal fluctuations, but it does not thin out. The increased estrogen levels during pregnancy can cause the vaginal epithelium to become thicker, more pliable, and better vascularized.",

      "explanation": "abdominal pain, with a fibroid uterus, but no fever and a normal WBC count, could be: Option A. Red degeneration of fibroid Explanation: Option A. Red degeneration of fibroid: Correct. Red degeneration of a fibroid occurs due to inadequate blood supply, leading to hemorrhage and necrosis within the fibroid tissue. It can cause severe abdominal pain, especially during pregnancy when fibroids may undergo changes due to increased vascularity. This condition does not typically cause fever or elevated white blood cell count. Option B. Preterm labor: Less likely. Preterm labor can cause abdominal pain during pregnancy, but it is not directly related to the presence of a fibroid. Preterm labor can be associated with uterine contractions, back pain, and a change in vaginal discharge. Option C. Torsion of fibroid: Less likely. Torsion of a fibroid, where the fibroid twists on its pedicle, can cause severe pain. However, this is a relatively rare event. Torsion of a fibroid can lead to ischemia and necrosis, causing intense pain. It may or may not be associated with fever, depending on the presence of infection. Option D.

      "explanation": "maintaining the anteversion of the uterus. The round ligament is a band of fibrous tissue that originates from the upper part of the uterus near the fallopian tubes and extends through the inguinal canal to attach to the labia majora. It helps to support the uterus and keep it in an anteverted (forward-tilted) position. As the uterus grows and expands during pregnancy, the round ligament stretches and allows the uterus to expand while maintaining its anteverted position. This helps to support the growing fetus and maintain the proper alignment of the uterus within the pelvis. Incorrect Options: Option B- Cardinal ligament: The cardinal ligament provides important support to the cervix and upper part of the vagina. It helps to hold the uterus in place and plays a role in maintaining its stability. However, it is not specifically responsible for maintaining the anteversion of the uterus during pregnancy. Option C- Uterosacral ligament: The uterosacral ligament provides support to the uterus and helps to anchor it to the sacrum (lower part of the spine). It is involved in maintaining the position and stability of the uterus but is not primarily responsible for maintaining anteversion during pregnancy. Option D- Pubocervical ligament: The pubocervical ligament provides support to the cervix and connects it to the pubic bone.

The NT scan is used to assess the risk of certain chromosomal abnormalities, particularly Down syndrome. It involves measuring the thickness of the fluid-filled space at the back of the baby's neck. Option B- 12-14 weeks: This option is also incorrect. In the 12-14 week period, a combination of tests called the first-trimester screening is typically conducted.

      "explanation": "continue life-long - This option is the correct management for a woman diagnosed with HIV in her first trimester. Initiating ART immediately after diagnosis is essential to suppress the virus, reduce the viral load, and minimize the risk of transmitting HIV to the fetus. Continuing ART life-long is necessary to maintain viral suppression, preserve the mother's health, and prevent transmission to sexual partners. Incorrect Options Option A- Start ART immediately and continue till 6 weeks after delivery: This option is not the most appropriate management for a pregnant woman diagnosed with HIV in her first trimester. While initiating ART immediately is important to suppress the HIV virus and prevent transmission to the fetus, discontinuing treatment after 6 weeks post-delivery would leave the woman at risk of disease progression and complications. Option B- Start ART after the 1st trimester and continue life-long: This option is also not the most appropriate management. Delaying the initiation of ART until after the 1st trimester can increase the risk of transmission of HIV to the fetus during the early stages of pregnancy. The recommended approach is to start ART as soon as possible after diagnosis, regardless of the trimester. Option D- Start ART after the 1st trimester and continue till 6 weeks after delivery: This option is not the most appropriate management. As mentioned earlier, delaying ART initiation until after the 1st trimester increases the risk of transmission to the fetus during the early stages of pregnancy.

During this scan, the sonographer can also assess the number of gestational sacs, placentas, and amniotic fluid levels, which helps determine the type of twin pregnancy. Identifying the presence of two separate gestational sacs and placentas during this time indicates a dizygotic (fraternal) twin pregnancy, while a single gestational sac and placenta suggest a monozygotic (identical) twin pregnancy. Incorrect Options: Option A: 18-22 weeks - While an ultrasound performed between 18-22 weeks can provide detailed information about fetal anatomy and development, it may not be the ideal time to accurately determine the type of twin pregnancy. By this stage, the anatomical features of the fetuses and their placentas may be more developed and distinguishable, but earlier ultrasound examinations, particularly in the first trimester, are typically more reliable in determining the type of twin pregnancy. Option B: 24-28 weeks - Although an ultrasound performed between 24-28 weeks can provide valuable information about the growth and development of the fetuses, it is not the best time to identify the type of twin pregnancy. By this stage, the placentas and amniotic sacs may have undergone changes and may not be as clearly distinguishable as in earlier stages of pregnancy. Option D: 14-18 weeks - While an ultrasound performed between 14-18 weeks can provide important information about fetal development, it may not be the optimal time to accurately determine the type of twin pregnancy.

The urine is then excreted into the amniotic sac, contributing to the volume of amniotic fluid. Incorrect options: Option A: Fetal skin: Fetal skin does contribute to the production of amniotic fluid, but it is not the major source. Fetal skin secretes a substance called vernix caseosa, which, along with other fetal skin cells and glandular secretions, contributes to the composition of amniotic fluid. However, the amount of fluid generated from fetal skin is relatively small compared to fetal urine. Option C: Placental cell membrane: The placental cell membrane, also known as the amnion, plays a crucial role in enclosing the amniotic sac and protecting the fetus. While it does contribute to the overall volume of amniotic fluid, it is not the major source of fluid secretion. The amnion primarily acts as a barrier between the fetal and maternal circulation, rather than actively secreting fluid. Option D: Plasma: Plasma refers to the fluid component of blood.

      "explanation": "gestation) can be caused by various factors. One of the common causes is cervical incompetence, also known as cervical insufficiency. Cervical incompetence refers to the inability of the cervix to retain a pregnancy, leading to repeated second-trimester pregnancy losses. In cervical incompetence, the cervix is structurally weak or lacks the normal ability to remain closed during pregnancy. As a result, the cervix may start to efface (thin out) and dilate prematurely, leading to the loss of the pregnancy. Cervical incompetence is often associated with painless cervical dilation and bulging of the amniotic sac through the cervix. Other causes of mid-trimester abortions, such as chromosomal abnormalities, placenta previa, or thyroid abnormalities, can also contribute to pregnancy losses, but given the history provided, cervical incompetence is the most likely reason in this scenario. Cervical incompetence, also known as an incompetent cervix or cervical insufficiency, is a condition where the cervix begins to dilate and efface prematurely during pregnancy, often leading to late miscarriages or preterm births. In women with cervical incompetence, the cervix is unable to support the weight of the growing pregnancy, resulting in painless cervical dilation and pregnancy loss, typically occurring in the second trimester. Cervical incompetence is a likely cause for recurrent mid-trimester miscarriages in this scenario. Incorrect options: Option A: Chromosomal abnormality: Chromosomal abnormalities can be a cause of pregnancy loss, but they are not specific to mid-trimester abortions. Cervical incompetence, also known as an incompetent cervix or cervical insufficiency, is a condition where the cervix begins to dilate and efface prematurely during pregnancy, often leading to late miscarriages or preterm births. In women with cervical incompetence, the cervix is unable to support the weight of the growing pregnancy, resulting in painless cervical dilation and pregnancy loss, typically occurring in the second trimester. Cervical incompetence is a likely cause for recurrent mid-trimester miscarriages in this scenario. Option C: Placenta previa: Placenta previa, a condition where the placenta partially or completely covers the cervix, is associated with third-trimester bleeding but not necessarily mid-trimester abortions. Placenta previa, a condition where the placenta partially or completely covers the cervix, can lead to bleeding during the later stages of pregnancy. While placenta previa can cause complications, such as bleeding and preterm delivery, it is not the most probable cause for the described recurrent miscarriages. Option D: Thyroid abnormality: Thyroid abnormalities can contribute to pregnancy complications, but they are not commonly associated with mid-trimester abortions. Thyroid disorders, particularly uncontrolled hypothyroidism, can contribute to infertility and pregnancy complications. However, in the context of recurrent mid-trimester miscarriages, cervical incompetence is a more likely cause compared to thyroid abnormalities.",

      "explanation": "several changes in the respiratory system to accommodate the needs of both the mother and the developing fetus. One of these changes is a decrease in the FRC, which refers to the volume of air remaining in the lungs at the end of normal expiration. The decrease in FRC occurs due to a combination of factors. The enlarging uterus pushes against the diaphragm, reducing the available space for lung expansion. Additionally, hormonal changes during pregnancy, particularly the increased levels of progesterone, affect respiratory drive and can lead to a decrease in FRC. Incorrect Options: Option A: Minute volume decreases by 50%: This statement is incorrect. During pregnancy, the minute volume, which represents the amount of air breathed in one minute, actually increases. The increase in minute volume is primarily due to an increase in tidal volume (the amount of air inhaled and exhaled during normal breathing) rather than an increase in respiratory rate. Option B: Residual volume increases: This statement is also incorrect. Residual volume refers to the volume of air that remains in the lungs after a maximal exhalation. In pregnancy, residual volume does not typically increase. Instead, it may decrease slightly due to the upward displacement of the diaphragm by the growing uterus. Option D: Total lung capacity increases: This statement is incorrect as well. Total lung capacity represents the maximum volume of air the lungs can hold. While certain lung volumes and capacities change during pregnancy, such as FRC, total lung capacity generally remains unchanged or may have only a slight increase. Reference: .",

In pregnancy, the definition of anemia is based on a higher cutoff of hemoglobin (Hb) compared to non-pregnant scenarios. Physiological hemodilution is a normal occurrence during pregnancy, where the blood volume expands more than the increase in red blood cell mass, leading to a relative dilution of the red blood cells.

To account for this, higher cutoff values for Hb are used to define anemia during pregnancy compared to non-pregnant individuals. Incorrect option: Option B . Both assertion and reason are true, but the reason is not the correct explanation for the assertion: This option is incorrect. The reason provided, which is physiological hemodilution in pregnancy, is indeed the correct explanation for the assertion. Therefore, Option B is not the correct answer. Option C .

      "explanation": "invade the maternal decidua and myometrium. They play a crucial role in the establishment of maternal-fetal circulation. These trophoblasts penetrate the spiral arterioles in the decidua and myometrium, converting them into low-resistance vessels that supply the intervillous space, ensuring adequate blood flow to the placenta for fetal nourishment and oxygen exchange. This invasion of extravillous trophoblasts is essential for the success of pregnancy and proper development of the placenta. Incorrect Options: Option B. Endovascular : Endovascular trophoblasts refer to the subtype of extravillous trophoblasts that invade and modify the walls of spiral arteries in the maternal decidua and myometrium. This invasion leads to the conversion of high-resistance, muscular spiral arteries into low-resistance, dilated vessels. This modification ensures adequate maternal blood flow to the placental intervillous space, providing essential nutrients and oxygen to the developing fetus. Option C. Tertiary villus: Tertiary villi represent the terminal stage of villous development in the placenta, characterized by mature capillaries surrounded by syncytiotrophoblasts. They do not specifically penetrate spiral arterioles. Option D. Interstitial: Interstitial trophoblasts are found within the placental tissue but are not primarily involved in modifying maternal blood vessels. They are important for placental development and tissue integrity. The modification of spiral arterioles by extravillous trophoblasts, specifically the endovascular subtype, is critical for ensuring proper maternal-fetal blood exchange and supporting a healthy pregnancy.",

      "explanation": "Correct Ans: B McRoberts maneuver: This option is correct. The McRoberts maneuver is a technique used to resolve shoulder dystocia, a condition where the baby's shoulder becomes impacted behind the mother's pubic bone after the delivery of the head. The McRoberts maneuver involves flexing the mother's legs sharply toward her abdomen, which helps to increase the angle of the pelvis and create more space for the shoulders to pass through the birth canal. Incorrect Option: Option A . Cleidotomy: This option is incorrect. Cleidotomy is a surgical procedure involving the cutting of the fetal collarbone (clavicle) to facilitate delivery of the shoulders in cases of shoulder dystocia. However, it is not the recommended first-line maneuver in the scenario described. Option C. C-section: This option is incorrect. While a C-section may be necessary in cases of prolonged shoulder dystocia or if other maneuvers fail to release the impacted shoulder, it is not the first-line intervention in this scenario where only one minute has passed after the delivery of the baby's head. Option D . Lateral traction: This option is incorrect. Lateral traction is a technique used to apply gentle, controlled pressure on the fetal head during delivery to facilitate the delivery of the shoulders. However, in the scenario described, where the shoulder has not been delivered after one minute, the McRoberts maneuver is a more appropriate initial maneuver to attempt before resorting to other interventions.

While it can help identify certain abnormalities, it is not the primary diagnostic test for vesicovaginal fistula. VVF involves an abnormal connection between the bladder and the vagina, which is best visualized directly. Option B. Cystoscopy: Cystoscopy is the gold standard for diagnosing vesicovaginal fistula. During cystoscopy, a thin tube with a camera (cystoscope) is inserted into the bladder through the urethra. This procedure allows direct visualization of the interior of the bladder. In cases of vesicovaginal fistula, the abnormal opening between the bladder and the vagina can be observed, confirming the diagnosis. Option C. 3 Swab Test: There is no standard medical test referred to as the \"3 Swab Test.\" It does not pertain to the diagnosis of vesicovaginal fistula or any specific medical condition. Option D.

In a healthy full-term pregnancy, amniotic fluid is typically clear and free of any visible particles or specks. It is odorless and serves several important functions, including protecting the fetus, maintaining a stable temperature, and allowing for fetal movement and development. Cloudiness or the presence of white specks in amniotic fluid can indicate infection, meconium staining (when the baby passes stool in the amniotic fluid), or other complications. In such cases, further evaluation by healthcare providers is necessary to ensure the well-being of both the mother and the fetus. Clear amniotic fluid without any visible particles is a sign of a healthy amniotic sac and a healthy pregnancy. Incorrect Options: Option A. Clear with white specks : Amniotic fluid should ideally be clear without any visible specks or particles. The presence of white specks can indicate meconium staining, which occurs when the baby passes stool (meconium) in the amniotic fluid. Meconium-stained amniotic fluid may suggest fetal distress and requires medical evaluation. Option B. Cloudy without white specks : Cloudiness in amniotic fluid can indicate infection. Cloudy amniotic fluid may contain pus or other inflammatory substances, suggesting the presence of infection in the uterus. In such cases, medical attention is necessary to assess and treat the infection. Option D. Cloudy with white specks : This combination suggests both infection (cloudiness) and meconium staining (white specks).

The crown rump length (CRL) measured during the transvaginal ultrasound is 5 mm, and a well-formed gestational sac is observed with a calculated gestational age of 5.6 weeks on TVS. Given these findings, the next line of management would be to repeat the transvaginal ultrasound after one week. This follow-up ultrasound is important to assess the growth and development of the embryo, particularly to confirm the presence of fetal cardiac activity. At this early stage of pregnancy, the absence of cardiac activity may indicate a nonviable pregnancy, such as a missed miscarriage or blighted ovum. Incorrect Options: Option A. Wait and watch for 4 weeks: Waiting for 4 weeks without any further assessment or intervention would not be the appropriate management in this case. It is necessary to closely monitor the pregnancy and assess for any changes in subsequent ultrasounds. Option C . Serum HCG levels: While measuring serum human chorionic gonadotropin (HCG) levels can provide additional information about the progression of pregnancy, it may not be the next immediate step in management. Serial HCG levels can be useful in monitoring the rise or fall of HCG levels over time, but in this case, a repeat TVS is more appropriate to evaluate the viability of the pregnancy. Option D .

      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "warfarin embryopathy. Warfarin is an oral anticoagulant that crosses the placenta and can cause fetal developmental abnormalities, known as warfarin embryopathy. Therefore, it is crucial to manage anticoagulation therapy appropriately during pregnancy to minimize the risk to the developing fetus. The correct approach in this situation is to replace warfarin with heparin in the first trimester. Heparin is a different type of anticoagulant that does not cross the placenta and is considered safer during pregnancy. By switching to heparin, the risk of further embryopathy or developmental abnormalities associated with warfarin can be minimized. Incorrect Options: Option A . Continue warfarin throughout the pregnancy: Continuing warfarin throughout the pregnancy is not recommended in this case, as it can pose a risk to the developing fetus and potentially lead to further embryopathy or developmental abnormalities. Option C . Give acicoumarin: Acicoumarin is another oral anticoagulant similar to warfarin. Given the history of warfarin embryopathy, it is not advisable to substitute warfarin with acicoumarin, as it has a similar mechanism of action and potential risks to the fetus. Option D . Use LMW heparin: Low molecular weight (LMW) heparin is a form of heparin that is commonly used for anticoagulation during pregnancy. However, in this specific case of a known history of warfarin embryopathy, using standard heparin (unfractionated heparin) is preferred over LMW heparin, as it allows for more precise dosage adjustments and monitoring.

Fetal fibronectin (fFN): Fetal fibronectin is a protein that acts as a biological glue between the fetal sac and the uterine lining. It helps to maintain the stability of the fetal sac in the uterus. The presence of fFN in vaginal secretions between 22 and 35 weeks of gestation may indicate a higher risk of preterm labor.

Alpha fetoprotein (AFP): AFP is a protein produced by the fetal liver. It is primarily used as a screening test for neural tube defects and certain fetal abnormalities, but it is not specifically used for assessing preterm labor. Therefore, AFP is not the most appropriate test in this scenario. Option B . Beta HCG ( β -hCG): Beta HCG is a hormone produced by the placenta.

Assessing the cervical length via ultrasound helps determine if there is cervical shortening or insufficient cervical length, which would necessitate interventions such as cervical cerclage (suturing the cervix) to prevent preterm delivery. Incorrect Options: Option B . Cervical cerclage: Cervical cerclage is a surgical procedure in which the cervix is stitched closed to provide support and prevent premature dilation. While cervical cerclage is a potential intervention for patients with cervical insufficiency, it is not the next step in management. First, the cervical length needs to be evaluated via ultrasound to determine if cervical insufficiency is present. Option C . Complete bed rest: Complete bed rest has been traditionally recommended in the past for patients with a history of preterm labor or cervical insufficiency. However, current evidence does not support the routine use of bed rest as an effective intervention for preventing preterm birth. Therefore, complete bed rest is not the next step in management. Option D . Abdominal cerclage: Abdominal cerclage is a surgical procedure in which a band or suture is placed around the top of the cervix through an abdominal incision.

While it may be performed during pregnancy, it is not specifically done in the labor room. Therefore, MCA doppler is not the correct procedure done in the labor room. Option D . Amniotic fluid index determination: The amniotic fluid index (AFI) determination is a prenatal ultrasound measurement used to assess the quantity of amniotic fluid surrounding the fetus. It is typically performed during regular antenatal check-ups and not specifically done in the labor room. Therefore, determining the amniotic fluid index is not the correct procedure done in the labor room",

      "question": "A pregnant woman delivered a baby with the normal expulsion of an intact placenta. After half an hour she started bleeding per vaginal. On examination, she was hypotensive and a boggy mass was palpated per abdomen. USG showed retained placental tissues. What is the likely diagnosis?",
      "options": {
        "A": "Placenta membranacea",
        "B": "Placenta succenturiata",
        "C": "Circummarginate placenta",
        "D": "Circumvallate placenta"
      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "succenturiata is a condition in which there are accessory or accessory lobes of placental tissue connected to the main placenta by blood vessels. These accessory lobes can be retained in the uterus after the delivery of the main placenta, leading to postpartum bleeding. Placenta succenturiata: This is the correct answer. Placenta succenturiata refers to the presence of accessory lobes of placental tissue that are connected to the main placenta by blood vessels. Retention of these accessory lobes can lead to postpartum bleeding, which is consistent with the clinical presentation described in the question. Incorrect Option: Option A . Placenta membranacea: Placenta membranacea is a condition characterized by a thin placental membrane that covers the entire chorionic surface. It is a rare condition and is not associated with postpartum bleeding or the presence of accessory lobes. Option C . Circummarginate placenta: Circummarginate placenta is a condition in which the placenta has an irregular or scalloped margin. While it can be associated with an increased risk of postpartum bleeding, it does not involve the presence of accessory lobes as seen in placenta succenturiata. Option D . Circumvallate placenta: Circumvallate placenta is a condition in which the placenta has a raised, rolled-up margin. It is associated with an increased risk of complications such as placental abruption, but it is not directly related to postpartum bleeding caused by retained placental tissue. Reference: .",

      "question": "Which of the following changes can be seen in the quadruple screening for Down syndrome?",
      "options": {
        "A": "Elevated ß-hCG, PAPP-A and lower estriol, AFP",
        "B": "Elevated ß-hCG, Inhibin and lower estriol, AFP",
        "C": "Lower ß-hCG, PAPP-A and elevated estriol, AFP",
        "D": "Lower ß-hCG, Inhibin and elevated estriol, AFP"
      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "prenatal screening test performed between 15 and 20 weeks of pregnancy to assess the risk of certain chromosomal abnormalities, particularly Down syndrome (Trisomy 21). The quadruple screening measures four substances in the maternal blood: ß-hCG (human chorionic gonadotropin): In pregnancies affected by Down syndrome, ß-hCG levels are often higher than normal. Inhibin A: Elevated levels of inhibin A have been associated with an increased risk of Down syndrome. Estriol: Estriol is a form of estrogen produced by the placenta. In pregnancies affected by Down syndrome, estriol levels are typically lower than expected. AFP (alpha-fetoprotein): AFP levels are typically lower in pregnancies affected by Down syndrome. Elevated ß-hCG, Inhibin, and lower estriol, AFP: This is the correct answer. Elevated ß-hCG and inhibin levels, along with lower estriol and AFP levels, are characteristic findings in the quadruple screening for Down syndrome. Incorrect Option: Option A . Elevated ß-hCG, PAPP-A, and lower estriol, AFP: This option is incorrect. While elevated ß-hCG and lower estriol are observed in Down syndrome, the presence of PAPP-A and AFP in the answer choice makes it incorrect. PAPP-A is not typically included in the quadruple screening, and AFP levels are lower, not elevated, in Down syndrome. Option C . Lower ß-hCG, PAPP-A, and elevated estriol, AFP: This option is incorrect. While lower ß-hCG and elevated estriol levels are seen in Down syndrome, the presence of PAPP-A and AFP in the answer choice makes it incorrect. Option D . Lower ß-hCG, Inhibin, and elevated estriol, AFP: This option is incorrect. While lower ß-hCG and elevated estriol levels are seen in Down syndrome, the presence of inhibin and AFP in the answer choice makes it incorrect Reference: .",

      "question": "A young female has history of an incomplete abortion . She has had amenorrhea since then. Her FSH now is 6 mlU/ml . Which of the following can be a cause for her amenorrhea?",
      "options": {
        "A": "Pituitary dysfunction",
        "B": "Ovarian dysfunction",
        "C": "First pregnancy",
        "D": "Uterine synechiae"
      },
      "correct_answer": "D",
      "explanation": "to the presence of adhesions or scar tissue inside the uterine cavity. These adhesions can result from previous uterine surgery, such as a dilation and curettage (D&C) procedure following a miscarriage. Uterine synechiae can cause amenorrhea by obstructing the menstrual flow. In this case, the history of a incomplete abortion followed by amenorrhea suggests the possibility of uterine synechiae as the cause. Incorrect Option: Option A . Pituitary dysfunction: Pituitary dysfunction can lead to hormonal imbalances and disrupt the normal menstrual cycle. However, with an FSH (follicle-stimulating hormone) level of 6 mlU/ml, which is within the normal range, it is less likely to be the cause in this case. Option B . Ovarian dysfunction: Ovarian dysfunction, such as polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) or premature ovarian insufficiency (POI), can cause amenorrhea. However, the FSH level of 6 mlU/ml suggests that the ovaries are functioning normally, making ovarian dysfunction less likely in this case. Option C . First pregnancy: Having a first pregnancy, particularly if it ends in a spontaneous abortion, would not directly cause prolonged amenorrhea. After a spontaneous abortion, the menstrual cycle typically resumes within a few weeks to a few months. Therefore, first pregnancy is an incorrect choice in this context Reference: .",

      "question": "A 26 year old female presents with 35 weeks and 3 days of gestation, AFI = 5 and there is no end-diastolic blood flow . What is the management?",
      "options": {
        "A": "Immediate termination",
        "B": "Give surfactant and wait till 36 weeks",
        "C": "Do Doppler everyday to check for reversion",
        "D": "Terminate after 37 weeks"
      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "index (AFI) of 5 and no end-diastolic blood flow, the correct option is: Option B. Give surfactant and wait till 36 weeks This situation indicates fetal compromise due to reduced amniotic fluid (oligohydramnios) and absent end-diastolic blood flow, suggesting placental insufficiency. In such cases, delivery may be indicated to prevent further compromise to the fetus. Giving surfactant can help in the lung maturation of the fetus, which is crucial if preterm delivery is anticipated. Incorrect options: Option A. Immediate termination might be considered if the fetal condition worsens or if there are signs of acute distress, but the decision should be made considering the overall condition of the mother and the fetus. Option C. Doing Doppler every day to check for reversion is not the most appropriate approach. Continuous monitoring and assessment are necessary, but daily Doppler may not be needed unless there are significant changes in the fetal status. Option D. Terminating after 37 weeks might not be appropriate in this case due to the current compromised fetal condition, which necessitates closer monitoring and potential intervention before term.

      "question": "At what point should a recently positive UTP tested women suffering with cardiac disease taking warfarin therapy be recommended to transition to heparin?",
      "options": {
        "A": "At the onset of labour",
        "B": "34 weeks",
        "C": "12 weeks",

      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "(b) pulmonary hypertension, (c) mechanical heart valve, (d) atrial fibrillation. The patient taking warfarin should discontinue it as soon as pregnancy is diagnosed and to replace it by heparin 5,000 units twice daily subcutaneously up to 12th week. Low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) can also be used. This is then replaced by warfarin tablet 3 mg. daily to be taken at the same time each day and continued up to 36 weeks. Thereafter it is replaced by heparin up to 7 days postpartum. Warfarin is then to be continued Incorrect Option: Option A. At the onset of labor: Switching from warfarin to heparin at the onset of labor may not provide adequate anticoagulation coverage throughout the entire duration of labor and postpartum period. It is important to transition to heparin prior to labor to ensure continuous anticoagulation. Option B . 34 weeks: While 34 weeks is closer to the end of pregnancy, it is still slightly earlier than the recommended time for switching to heparin. The preferred timing is usually closer to term. Option D. 40 weeks: Waiting until 40 weeks to switch to heparin may result in a shorter duration of anticoagulation coverage before labor begins. It is generally preferred to initiate the switch to heparin earlier to ensure optimal safety for the fetus. Reference: .",
