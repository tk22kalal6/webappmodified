      },
      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "of blood glucose levels. Correct Answer: C) Diagnose her with GDM and initiate dietary modifications with close monitoring of blood glucose levels. Explanation: According to WHO criteria, GDM is diagnosed if Diagnosis Gestational Diabetes Pre-existing Diabetes Timing During pregnancy Present before conception Criteria Fasting Plasma glucose ≥ 92 mg/dL ≥ 126 mg/dL (on two occasions) 1-hour plasma glucose ≥ 180 mg/dL ≥ 200 mg/dL (with hyperglycemic symptoms) 2-hour plasma glucose ≥ 153 mg/dL ≥ 200 mg/dL (during an OGTT in asymptomatic individuals) HbA1c ≥ 5.7-6.4% ≥ 6.5% Management Resolves after delivery. Requires intensive management before and during pregnancy. After experiencing gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) during pregnancy, a mother may have an increased risk of developing type 2 diabetes in later life. Lifestyle modifications are appropriate, but immediate diagnosis and management of GDM are necessary. Monitoring without intervention is inappropriate because the patient meets the criteria for GDM diagnosis and requires management to optimise maternal and fetal outcomes.

      "question": "A 28-year-old female, at 24 weeks of gestation, comes to the antenatal clinic for a regular checkup. Which of the following tests is most appropriate for diagnosing gestational diabetes mellitus?",
      "options": {
        "A": "Fasting plasma glucose",
        "B": "Oral glucose tolerance test",
        "C": "Random plasma glucose test",
        "D": "HbA1c"
      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: B) Oral glucose tolerance test Explanation: The most appropriate test for diagnosis of gestational diabetes is the oral glucose tolerance test. One-step approach recommended by WHO and IAD PSG (International Association of Diabetes and Pregnancy Study Group): It is done in all pregnant females at 24-28 weeks. It is used both for screening and diagnostic purposes. The patient is advised to have an unrestricted diet for 72 hours, followed by overnight fasting, and then 75 gm of glucose is given. A total of 3 samples are taken: 1st sample: Fasting sample. 2nd sample: After 1 hour of 75 gm of glucose. 3rd sample: After 2 hours of 75 gm of glucose. Interpretation: If any 1 value is abnormal, the patient is considered as having gestational diabetes. mg/dL mmol/litre Fasting ≤ 92 5.1 1 hour ≤ 180 10.1 2 hours ≤ 153 8.5 The two-step approach advocated by ACOG is not recommended due to its two-step process: Oral glucose challenge test: Performed by giving 50 gm of glucose irrespective of previous meals and no fasting required. Glucose tolerance test: Confirmatory test is done using 100 gm of glucose after overnight fasting of 8 hours. Fasting plasma glucose (FPG) (Option A) measures blood glucose after an overnight fast; useful for screening for diabetes but not sufficient alone to diagnose GDM. A random plasma glucose test (Option C) measures blood glucose at any time of the day; it is not specific enough to diagnose GDM, as glucose levels can vary widely. HbA1c (glycated haemoglobin) (Option D) reflects average blood glucose over the past 2-3 months; useful for diagnosing pre-existing diabetes but not typically used for GDM diagnosis. Reference: 1.

      "question": "A 32 y/o pregnant woman presents for her routine prenatal visit at 32 weeks gestation. She has a history of type 2 diabetes mellitus, well-controlled with metformin. Despite following the dietary recommendations, she reports occasional difficulty managing her blood glucose levels. Which complication is most likely associated with her condition?",
      "options": {
        "A": "Oligohydramnios",
        "B": "Fetal growth restriction",
        "C": "Macrosomia",
        "D": "Placental abruption"
      },
      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: C) Macrosomia Explanation: Macrosomia, defined as fetal weight above the 90th percentile for gestational age, is highly associated with diabetes in pregnancy, particularly when maternal blood glucose levels are not well controlled. Fetal macrosomia with birth weight >4 kg (>90th percentile) probably results from: Maternal hyperglycemia → hypertrophy and hyperplasia of the fetal islets of Langerhans → increased secretion of fetal insulin → stimulates carbohydrate utilisation and accumulation of fat. Insulin-like growth factors (IGF-I and II) are also involved in fetal growth and adiposity. Elevating maternal free fatty acid (FFA) in diabetes leads to increased transfer to the fetus → acceleration of triglyceride synthesis → adiposity. With good diabetic control, the incidence of macrosomia is markedly reduced. This condition increases the risk of complications during delivery, such as Shoulder dystocia (Fetal cause). Cesarean delivery (Maternal cause) Indication: Weight >4.5kg. Complications of gestational diabetes mellitus: Maternal Fetal Preterm labour. Urinary tract infections and vulvovaginitis. Increased incidence of preeclampsia. Polyhydramnios. Maternal distress. Puerperal sepsis. Lactation failure PPH (post-partum hemorrhage) Fetal hyperglycemia. Macrosomia. Polycythemia Hyperglycemia Delayed lung maturity NEC (necrotising enterocolitis) Hyperbilirubinemia Hypocalcemia Hypomagnesimia Overt Diabetes can lead to complications like IUD, IUGR, pre-eclampsia and ketoacidosis. Oligohydramnios (Option A) or reduced amniotic fluid volume, can occur in pregnancies complicated by diabetes if there is vasculopathy. Still, it is not the most likely maternal problem associated with a fetus that is significantly larger than average (macrosomia). Fetal growth restriction (Option B) can occur in pregnancies complicated by diabetes if there is vasculopathy. However, it is not the most likely maternal problem associated with a fetus with macrosomia (GDM). Placental abruption (Option D) is a serious complication where the placenta separates from the uterine wall prematurely. While it can occur in pregnancies complicated by diabetes due to vascular changes, it is less commonly associated with macrosomia. Reference: William's Obstetrics Edition 26th Page 1081 , 1082",

      "explanation": "Correct Answer: D) Diabetic Neuropathy Explanation: Diabetic neuropathy during pregnancy can manifest as diabetic gastropathy. It involves damage to the nerves that control the stomach muscles, leading to delayed gastric emptying. The patient experiences persistent nausea and vomiting. It is treated with metoclopramide and domperidone. Diabetic Retinopathy (Option A) is characterised by neovascularisation, microaneurysms and blot haemorrhages, it can lead to vision loss. Diabetic Ketoacidosis (Option B) is caused by reduced insulin, beta mimetic administration for tocolysis, and steroids for lung maturity. It presents with symptoms like excessive thirst, frequent urination, abdominal pain, and rapid breathing. Diabetic Nephropathy (Option C) is detected when microalbuminuria is 30 to 300 mg/24 hr. Associated with pre-eclampsia, preterm labour, and fetal growth restriction.",

      "question": "A 30 y/o female came at 28 wks gestation with 75 gm OGTT report showing 2 hr postprandial (PP) blood glucose value of 170 mg/dl. She was started on dietary modification and exercise. She came for follow up after 2 wks, her FBS is 120 mg/dl & 2hr postprandial is 160 mg/dl.. What is the best treatment for her now?",

      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: B) Insulin Explanation: Insulin is DOC in Gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM). 75gm 2 hr PP values > 140 suggest GDM, which is uncontrollable on a diet in the given scenario. Insulin dose: 75gm 2hr PP value (mg/dl) Insulin dose Time of day 120-160 4 units 30 min before breakfast 160-200 6 units 30 min before breakfast >200 8 units 30 min before breakfast FBS >95 Add 2 units Before dinner Continue dietary modification and exercise (Option A) is wrong because once dietary modification and exercise are started, the goals to be attained after 2 weeks are: FBS: 70-95 mg/dL. 1 hour post prandial: <140 mg/dL. 2 hour post prandial: <120 mg/dL. HbA1C: <6%. This goal is not attained in the given scenario. So, insulin needs to be started. Glibenclamide and Metformin (Option C&D) are the only oral hypoglycemic agents that can be given in gestational diabetes. They do not cause any teratogenic effect. But first line DOC in GDM is insulin. Other oral hypoglycemic drugs are C/I in GDM. Reference: William's obstetrics edition 26th, pg 1082",

      "explanation": "Correct Answer: D) Give morning dose of insulin on day of induction Explanation: Morning dose of insulin is omitted on the day of induction. Important points to remember on management of GDM mother during induction of labor: Evening dose of insulin before the day of induction is administered. The morning dose of insulin is omitted on the day of induction. Start normal saline (NS) at 100 - 125 ml/hr (option A). If blood sugar levels <70 mg/dl give 5%dextrose at 100-150 ml/hr (option B). If blood sugar levels >100 mg/dl give insulin at 1 - 1.25 units/hr (option C). Ideally blood sugar levels maintained between 70-100 mg/dl. Hourly monitoring of blood glucose is done.

However fetal growth scans are recommended. Fundus examination (Option A) is done to check for diabetic retinopathy. It will have proliferative retinopathy with neovascularisation and microaneurysms. Fetal Echo (Option B) is recommended between 22 - 24 weeks to detect fetal CVS anomalies with pregestational diabetes, especially if uncontrolled . A 24-hour urinary protein test (Option C) is done to diagnose diabetic nephropathy. In diabetic nephropathy, creatinine clearance is reduced, or there is persistent proteinuria ( ≥ 300 mg/24 hours) during the first 20 weeks of gestation.
