      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: A) Vesicovaginal fistula Explanation: This patient's history of prolonged and obstructed labor followed by continuous leakage of urine from the vagina without micturition strongly suggests a Vesicovaginal fistula. It's also the most common type of urinary fistula. Obstructed Labor is the most common cause for the development of VVF in Developing countries. (Developed countries - Hysterectomy). Vesicovaginal fistula: It is an abnormal communication between the bladder and vagina, typically caused by prolonged obstructed labor where pressure necrosis occurs between the bladder and vagina due to prolonged compression of the fetal presenting part against the pelvic bones. This leads to tissue breakdown and formation of a fistula, resulting in continuous leakage of urine through the vagina.

It is less common and typically presents with continuous urinary incontinence and amenorrhea.

      "question": "A 28-year-old primigravida woman has been in labor for the past 20 hours with little progress despite strong contractions. Despite attempts at assisted vaginal delivery, the labor is not progressing. Because of obstructed labor, an emergency cesarean section is performed. Postoperatively, the patient complains of continuous leakage of fluid from her vagina and inability to hold urine. Which of the following is most likely the diagnosis?",

      },
      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: C) Vesicovaginal fistula Explanation: In the above clinical condition the patient presented with obstructed labor and was managed with emergency cesarean section, with postoperative patient complaints of leakage of urine through the vagina. This is a classical case of vesico-vaginal fistula. Vesico-vaginal fistula (VVF): Vesico-vaginal fistula (VVF) is an abnormal passage which develops between the bladder and the vagina, leading to continuous and involuntary discharge of urine through the vagina. This condition typically results from prolonged obstructed labor or pelvic surgery complications, where tissues between the bladder and the vagina are damaged, causing the formation of the fistula. Management: Conservative Surgical Genitourinary fistulas may spontaneously close during continuous bladder drainage using an indwelling urinary catheter. In 10 percent of cases, urinary fistulas close spontaneously after 2 to 8 weeks of transurethral catheterization, especially if the fistula is small. Transvaginal Repair: This approach involves accessing the fistula through the vaginal wall. It is suitable for smaller fistulas and those located in favorable positions that allow for direct access and closure. Transabdominal Repair: Larger or more complex fistulas may require an abdominal approach. This can be done via laparotomy (open surgery) or laparoscopy (minimally invasive surgery). Laparoscopy is preferred when feasible as it offers faster recovery and reduced postoperative complications. Stress Incontinence (Option A): This involves urine leakage during activities that increase intra-abdominal pressure, like coughing or sneezing. It does not cause continuous leakage. Uretero Vaginal Fistula (Option B): This condition involves a connection between a ureter and the vagina, leading to continuous leakage of urine from one kidney. It's less common than VVF and typically follows surgery involving the ureters. Urge Incontinence (Option D): This is characterized by a sudden, intense urge to urinate followed by involuntary urine loss. It does not cause continuous leakage and is related to overactive bladder rather than an anatomical fistula. Reference: Williams textbook 4th edition pg no 578",

      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: C) Mixed urinary incontinence Explanation: Mixed urinary incontinence refers to a combination of two types of urinary incontinence: stress urinary incontinence (SUI) and urge urinary incontinence (UUI). This condition is characterised by symptoms of both types occurring concurrently in an individual. Individuals with mixed urinary incontinence experience symptoms of both SUI and UUI. They may have leakage of urine during activities that increase abdominal pressure (SUI), as well as sudden urges to urinate that lead to involuntary leakage (UUI). Types of urinary incontinence: Type Description Stress urinary incontinence Involuntary loss of urine with effort or physical exertion or when sneezing or coughing. Urgency urinary incontinence Involuntary loss of urine associated with urgency or sudden, compelling desire to void that is difficult to defer. Mixed urinary incontinence Involuntary loss of urine associated with urgency and with physical exertion, sneezing or coughing. Overactive bladder Urinary urgency, typically accompanied by frequency and nocturia, with or without urge urinary incontinence, in the absence of urinary tract infection or other obvious pathology. Nocturnal enuresis Involuntary loss of urine that occurs during sleep. Functional urinary incontinence Involuntary loss of urine that is due to cognitive, functional, or mobility impairments in the presence of an intact lower urinary tract system.

      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: C) Maintenance of urethrovesical angle Explanation: The condition mentioned above based on history is stress urinary incontinence which involves descent of the bladder neck below levator ani muscles and loss of urethrovesical angle (70-80%) which causes funneling of the bladder neck and upper urethra. Causes of stress urinary incontinence: Atony of pelvic floor muscles Damage to pudendal nerve during vaginal delivery Other etiologies: Intrinsic sphincter defect (20-25%) Detrusor overactivity Risk factors: Age Obesity (BMI>20) Smoking Pregnancy Cognitive and functional impairment Chronically increased abdominal pressure (Chronic cough, constipation, occupational lifting) Urge urinary incontinence: Involuntary loss of urine is associated with a compelling desire to void but an inability to control the dribbling of urine. Risk factors: Neurological conditions Bladder inflammation and infection Chronic constipation can exacerbate symptoms by increasing intra-abdominal pressure. (Option A) COPD results in chronic cough which in turn increases abdominal pressure leading to worsening of incontinence symptoms (Option B) Multiparous women after repeated child births are prone to loss of tone of the pelvic floor muscles.

      "correct_answer": "D",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: D) Cystoscopy Explanation: The condition mentioned above based on history is urinary incontinence for which cystoscopy is not routinely indicated. It is typically reserved for investigating abnormalities within the bladder or urethra, such as bladder stones or tumors. Genuine stress incontinence of urine (SUI/GSI): Genuine stress incontinence (GSI) of urine occurs when the bladder pressure exceeds urethral pressure during physical stress in the absence of detrusor contraction. Investigations for Urinary Incontinence: Urine Culture (Option A) Essential to rule out urinary tract infections before invasive tests. Stress Test Objective method to demonstrate stress urinary incontinence (SUI). Q-Dip cotton Swab Test: (outdated) Evaluates bladder neck mobility. Positive test if swab angle increases significantly (>20°). Marshall's and Bonney's Test: (outdated) Checks for the absence of urine leakage post-bladder neck elevation. Indicates potential benefit from surgical repair if negative. Urethroscopy Visualizes urethra, trigone, and bladder neck. Urodynamic testing: (Option C) Group of tests to assess urine storage and voiding. Urodynamic studies help diagnose the type and severity of urinary incontinence. Cystometry Measures bladder and urethral pressures during artificial filling to differentiate types of incontinence. Urethrocystometry Assesses urethral pressure dynamics, crucial for diagnosing incontinence conditions. Uroflowmetry Measures urine flow rate and volume, providing non-invasive data on voiding function. Micturition Cystourethrography Evaluates the urethrovesical angle to diagnose stress incontinence. Uroprofilometry Measures dynamic urethral pressures, crucial for diagnosing urethral conditions. Ultrasonography (Option B) Measures bladder volume and residual urine; useful for identifying bladder wall abnormalities. Videocystourethrography Integrates pressure studies with video to assess lower urinary tract function. MRI Studies Assesses pelvic floor muscle defects; helpful for surgical planning to correct incontinence. Reference: Williams Gynecology, 4th Edition, Pages 524-527",
