      "explanation": "anaemia of pregnancy In pregancy, there is dilutional anaemia due to increased plasma volume. To compensate for this, the haemoglobin cut-off for anaemia is reduced to 11g/dL from 12g/dL. Pathological anaemia of pregnancy anaemia due to acquired or hereditary conditions Iron deficiency anaemia is the most common form Other causes include megaloblastic anaemia, anaemia of chronic disease, anaemia of acute blood loss, hemolytic anaemia, thalassemia, and haemoglobinopathies. WHO defines anaemia in pregnancy as haemoglobin of <11g/dL Severe anaemia <7 g/dL Moderate anaemia 7-9.9 g/dL Mild anaemia 10-10.9 g/dL Iron deficiency due to inadequate dietary intake (Option A): this is the most common cause of pathological anaemia in pregnancy Vitamin B12 deficiency (Option C): this is also a cause of pathological anaemia in pregnancy. Normal MCV rules out this option. Placental abruption causing acute blood loss (Option D): the patient would present with other symptoms such as vaginal blood loss, and signs of fetal distress.

Chronic kidney disease (Option A) can lead to anaemia due to decreased erythropoietin production and impaired red blood cell production. However, it is not a common cause of anaemia specifically in pregnancy. Hypervolemia (Option B) refers to excess blood volume, a normal physiological adaptation in pregnancy. It is not a pathological cause of anaemia. Hyperthyroidism (Option D) can lead to increased metabolism and potentially contribute to anaemia in some cases, but it is not a common cause of anaemia specifically in pregnancy.",

Blood values in Iron Deficiency anaemia Serum Iron <30 mcg/100ml Total Iron binding capacity >400 mcg/dl Percentage saturation ≤ 10% Serum Ferritin <30 mcg/L (confirms iron-deficiency anaemia) MCHC <30% MCV <75 µ³ RBC <4 million/mm³ Hb <10g% Serum iron level (Option A) can fluctuate and is influenced by various factors such as recent meals and inflammation. It is not specific enough to confirm iron deficiency anaemia as levels can be low in other conditions as well. Total iron-binding capacity (TIBC) (Option B) measures the total amount of iron that can be bound by transferrin. While TIBC is increased in iron deficiency anaemia, it alone is not as specific as serum ferritin for confirming the diagnosis. Red blood cell distribution width (RDW) (Option C) measures the variation in the size of red blood cells. While RDW can be elevated in iron deficiency anaemia due to the presence of both microcytic and normocytic red blood cells, it is not specific enough for definitive diagnosis.

(Option A ruled out) 4 mg daily High-demand situations: Multiple pregnancies, anticonvulsant therapy, haemoglobinopathies, chronic infections/diseases. (Option C ruled out) 4 mg daily from 1 month before conception to about 12 weeks of pregnancy Prevent the recurrence of neural tube defects in women with prior affected infants. 4 mg daily for at least 4 weeks post-delivery Treat pregnancy-induced megaloblastic anaemia and replenish folate stores after childbirth. 1 mg daily with iron and a nutritious diet Improve symptoms and aid recovery from pregnancy-induced megaloblastic anaemia. (Option D ruled out) Complications of Megaloblastic anaemia: Miscarriage Fetal growth restriction (FGR) Prematurity Abruptio placentae Fetal malformations (e.g., cleft lip, cleft palate, neural tube defects ) Antenatal Screening for Neural Tube Defects (NTDs): Alpha-Fetoprotein (AFP) Screening : AFP is a protein produced by the fetus, and elevated levels in maternal serum or amniotic fluid are indicative of NTDs, including anencephaly and spina bifida. This screening is typically conducted in the second trimester. Amniotic fluid AFP is especially useful for confirming the diagnosis if there are concerns raised by other screening tests. Ultrasound (Sonography) : First Trimester : Ultrasound can help diagnose NTDs as early as 10 weeks gestation, especially in cases like anencephaly. Key findings may include absence of the cranial vault or the presence of angiomatous brain tissue. Second Trimester : In later stages, ultrasound remains a crucial tool for confirming NTDs. This can detect abnormalities such as spina bifida or anencephaly and assess other fetal characteristics like the head’s positioning or abnormalities such as hydramnios. Prevention : Prepregnancy counseling and folic acid supplementation are key preventive strategies. Folic acid intake of 4 mg daily starting at least one month before conception and continuing until the 12th week of pregnancy significantly reduces the risk of NTDs by about 85%.
