      "question": "A 32 year old pregnant woman at 38 weeks gestation presents to the labour and delivery unit with regular contractions. On examination, the fetus is found to be in a persistent transverse lie. What happens if the patient undergoes a spontaneous vaginal delivery?",

        "D": "Turtle sign"
      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: B) Bandl ring formation Explanation: Spontaneous vaginal delivery is not indicated in the transverse lie, as it can lead to hand prolapse and later a bandl ring. Transverse Lie and Spontaneous Delivery : Spontaneous delivery is impossible with a persistent transverse lie in a fully developed fetus. After membrane rupture, the fetal shoulder often prolapses and becomes impacted in the pelvis. Labour continues with vigorous uterine contractions, leading to a contraction ring, potentially forming a Bandl ring. Management of Transverse Lie : Active labour with a transverse lie generally requires cesarean delivery. Before or early in labor with intact membranes, an external cephalic version (ECV) can be attempted. ECV success rates are higher for transverse lie compared to breech fetuses. Bandl's Ring Schroeder's Ring Definition An abnormal ring of constriction that forms in the uterus, typically between the lower and upper uterine segments. It causes an extreme form of uterine atony A pathological ring of constriction that can occur in any stage of labor, resulting from oxytocin overuse, and may lead to uterine rupture Cause Prolonged second stage of labor Oxytocin overuse, or misuse of uterine stimulants Stage of Labor Second stage of labor Any stage of labor Management Cesarean section Discontinuation of oxytocin, relaxation of the uterus (using tocolytics), and possible cesarean section depending on severity Delivery of a full-term neonate (Option A): Spontaneous delivery in a transverse lie is highly unlikely as the hands are the presenting part, which leads to hand prolapse requiring an emergency cesarean section. Spontaneously turns to cephalic presentation (Option C): The transverse lie does not typically resolve spontaneously to a cephalic presentation during labour. An external cephalic version (ECV) would be needed before labor to attempt to turn the fetus to a head-first presentation manually. Turtle sign (Option D): The turtle sign refers to the retraction of the fetal head against the maternal perineum after it has passed through the vaginal introitus, indicating shoulder dystocia. This is not directly related to transverse lie. Reference: Williams Obstetrics, 26th Edition, Page 442",

      "correct_answer": "D",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: D) Placenta previa Explanation: This patient, who presented breech at 37 + 2 weeks, can undergo an external cephalic version (ECV), but placenta previa is an absolute contraindication to ECV. External cephalic version (ECV): Manipulations through the abdominal wall to achieve cephalic presentation. Prerequisites: Typically attempted before labour at 37 weeks gestation to balance fetal maturity risks and amniotic fluid volume. ECV before 37 weeks may increase success rates but does not lower cesarean rates and raises late-term birth risk. Spontaneous correction of breech presentation likely before 37 weeks. Early ECV might allow reversion to breech. Contraindications: Absolute contraindication: Placenta previa or situations where vaginal delivery isn't possible. Relative contraindications: Early labour, oligohydramnios, ruptured membranes, known nuchal cord, uterine abnormalities, fetal growth restriction, multiple gestations, prior abruption or risk factors. Fetal growth restriction (Option A): This is a relative contraindication to ECV and not an absolute contraindication. While FGR indicates a high-risk pregnancy that requires careful monitoring, ECV may still be considered. Oligohydramnios (Option B): Oligohydramnios, or low amniotic fluid, is also a relative contraindication. It can make the procedure more difficult and less likely to succeed, but it can still be considered. Ruptured membranes (Option C): Ruptured membranes are also a relative contraindication. The procedure becomes more challenging and risky after the membranes rupture, but it may still be considered with careful monitoring. Reference: Williams Obstetrics, 26th Edition, Page 528",

She should be kept nil per os (NPO) in case an emergency cesarean delivery is needed. Prerequisites of assisted breech extraction: Staff Requirements for Breech Extraction: Provider skilled in breech extraction. (Option C) Assistant to help with delivery. Anesthesia personnel for adequate analgesia or anaesthesia. Trained individual in newborn resuscitation. Maternal Preparation: Intravenous access is obtained for potential emergency cesarean section or maternal resuscitation. Labor Monitoring: One-on-one nursing due to increased cord prolapse risk. Continuous electronic monitoring of the fetal heart rate is preferred. (Option A) Fetal requirements: Fetal weight should be <4 kg (Option B) Contraindications to assisted breech extraction: Induction of labour should be avoided. Augmentation of labour should be avoided. These can lead to cord prolapse; therefore, a hands-off approach is preferred to allow spontaneous delivery.

      },
      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: C) Hip dysplasia Explanation: Hip dysplasia is a complication of breech presentation due to the specific positioning of the baby's legs in the uterus, and it cannot be avoided regardless of the mode of delivery (Vaginal or c-section). Complications of breech delivery: Category Complications Maternal Increased risk of operative delivery (cesarean section or assisted vaginal delivery). Increased risk of perineal trauma. Prolonged labour. Postpartum haemorrhage. Pain and discomfort Infection Fetal Umbilical cord prolapse. Birth trauma, including head injuries (due to increased risk of head entrapment in vaginal delivery). Hypoxic-ischemic injury due to cord compression or prolonged delivery. Increased risk of birth defects or anomalies. During Delivery Shoulder dystocia (especially in breech extraction during vaginal delivery). Delayed delivery of the aftercoming head (leading to potential birth asphyxia). Increased risk of brachial plexus injuries. Increased risk of fetal fractures (such as clavicle fractures). Difficulty delivering the placenta (due to abnormal presentation). Birth trauma (Option A): This can occur in both breech and cephalic presentations but is not specifically more common in breech presentations overall. Genital tract lacerations (Option B): This refers to injuries to the mother's genital tract, which are not directly related to the fetal presentation. Umbilical cord prolapse (Option C): This is a serious complication more commonly associated with breech presentations during labor, but it is not considered an outcome that affects the infant after birth.

      "question": "During a vaginal breech delivery, you encounter a case where one of the baby's arms is extended behind the fetal head, causing difficulty in delivery. What technique is used to manage extended arms in this breech delivery scenario?",

        "D": "Duhrssen's incision"
      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: B) Lovset's maneuver Explanation: In a vaginal breech delivery scenario where one of the baby's arms is extended behind the fetal head, causing difficulty in delivery, the technique typically used to manage this situation is Lovset's manoeuvre. Principle: Due to the curved birth canal, one shoulder remains above the pubic bone while the other is below the sacral promontory. Rotating the fetal trunk with the back anterior and applying downward traction brings the posterior shoulder below the symphysis pubis. Procedure: Lift the baby, induce lateral flexion, rotate the trunk 180° to bring the posterior arm under the pubic arch, and hook out. Rotate the trunk opposite, keeping the back anterior, to deliver the anterior shoulder under the symphysis pubis. Classical manoeuvre (Option A): This typically involves bringing down an arm extended alongside the fetal head to facilitate delivery. It is a traditional method used in breech deliveries, but it may be challenging if the arm is positioned behind the head. Pinard's manoeuvre (Option C): This manoeuvre resolves shoulder dystocia by applying pressure to the anterior shoulder to rotate it internally or manipulate it for delivery. It may be used in some breech deliveries but is not specifically for managing extended arms. Duhrssen's incision (Option D): This refers to a surgical incision made in the cervix or lower uterine segment to facilitate delivery in cases of severe obstruction or dystocia. It is not directly related to managing extended arms in breech deliveries.",

      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: B) External cephalic version Explanation: In the given scenario, the pregnant woman presents at 37 weeks, the fetal head is not engaged, and the fetal status is stable, which is in a transverse lie. An external cephalic version could be the appropriate next step in management to attempt to reposition the fetus for a potential vaginal delivery. M/c cause of transverse lie - Prematurity It has high risk of cord prolapse Antenatal Management: If there are no contraindications, attempt an external cephalic version (ECV) beyond 35 weeks for the transverse lie. If Version Fails or is Contraindicated: Elective cesarean section is the preferred delivery method. (Option D) Management in Labor : In early labor, try an external cephalic version (ECV) if appropriate or opt for cesarean section if ECV is unsuccessful. In late labor, ECV is usually impractical due to ruptured membranes, so the cesarean section is preferred in such cases. Internal Version Considerations: Only for specific cases like managing the second twin. Immediate induction of labour (Option A): The fetal head is not engaged in the pelvis, which means the baby is not in a favourable position for a safe vaginal delivery. Attempting induction could increase the risk of complications such as cord prolapse or obstruction. Vaginal delivery with careful monitoring (Option C): Vaginal delivery is contraindicated in transverse lie due to the risk of cord prolapse or obstructed labour.

Reduced anteroposterior diameter at the inlet due to one sacral ala being underdeveloped or absent. Increased risk of difficult vaginal delivery; may require cesarean section. Robert’s Pelvis (Option D) Both sacral alae are absent, leading to a significant narrowing of the pelvic inlet. Severe contraction often necessitates cesarean delivery due to significant narrowing. Scoliotic Pelvis (Option B) Asymmetry in the pelvic bones is caused by lateral curvature of the spine (scoliosis). One of the oblique diameters contracts as a result of the pelvic asymmetry.

        "D": "Oblique posterior arrest"
      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: B) Normal progression of labour Explanation: In favourable conditions, the occiput posterior (OP) position usually progresses to normal labour and results in a normal vaginal delivery. Strong uterine contractions promote good flexion of the fetal neck, aiding in the descent of the fetus. The fetal head undergoes an internal rotation by 3/8th of a circle, positioning the occiput behind the pubic symphysis. Shoulders rotate by 2/8th of a circle to occupy the oblique diameter. The fetus descends further down in the pelvis, similar to the occiput anterior (OA) position. Head restitutes by 1/8th of a circle in the opposite direction of the internal rotation. The delivery process then proceeds like a normal vaginal delivery in the occiput anterior position. Outcomes of occipito-posterior position If circumstances are favourable: Normal vaginal delivery If circumstances are unfavourable: Malrotation - occipito sacral arrest , Deep transverse arrest Nonrotation - Oblique posterior arrest Occipitosacral arrest ( Option A) occurs when the fetal occiput mal-rotates posteriorly towards the sacral hollow. Although spontaneous delivery can sometimes happen in this position, if labour stops progressing, it is termed occipitosacral arrest. Deep transverse arrest (Option C) occurs when the occiput rotates 1/8th of a circle anteriorly, causing the sagittal suture to lie in the oblique diameter of the pelvis and then become arrested in that position. DTA seen in android >> anthropoid Oblique posterior arrest (Option D) due to nonrotation occurs when the sinciput and occiput simultaneously contact the pelvic floor because of fetal head deflexion. This results in the sagittal suture lying in the bispinous diameter of the pelvis, leading to arrest in that position.",

The fetal back is palpated towards the right flank. The anterior shoulder is felt away from the midline. The fetal heart rate is best heard over the maternal right lower quadrant. What is the most likely fetal position in this patient?",
      "options": {
        "A": "Right occipito anterior",

      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: C) Right occipito posterior Explanation: These findings are consistent with Right Occipito Posterior (ROP) Position. Most Common Malposition: Right occipito posterior (ROP). Causes: M/C cause of OP position- Android pelvis 2nd M/C cause of OP position- Deflexed head M/C cause of persistent/ Direct OP-Anthropoid pelvis Presence of sigmoid colon and uterine dextrorotation disfavour the Left Occipito-Posterior (LOP) position Engaging Diameters: Deflexed head: Occipitofrontal = 11.5 cm. Incompletely flexed head: Sub Occipitofrontal = 10 cm Well-flexed head: Suboccipitobregmatic = 9.5 cm. Outcomes: 90% of cases: Complete forward rotation to direct occipito anterior (OA) position, favourable for normal vaginal delivery (NVD). Incomplete rotation: Leads to the occipito-transverse position. Posterior rotation is possible. Left Occipito Posterior and Left Occipito Anterior (Option B and D): The fetal back would be on the left side of the abdomen, and the FHR would be heard over the left lower quadrant , not the right. Right Occipito Anterior (Option A) : The fetal back would be on the right side of the abdomen, and the FHR would be heard over the right lower quadrant . However, the anterior shoulder would be aligned with the midline , not away. Reference: Williams Obstetrics, 26th Edition, Page 423",

      "explanation": "Correct Answer: C) Lift the presenting part off the cord and then proceed to cesarean section the presenting part off the cord to provide relief from the pressure on the cord and then proceed to cesarean section as definitive management. Risk factors for cord prolapse Malpresentations: Transverse Breech (especially with flexed legs or footling) Compound presentation Contracted Pelvis Prematurity Twins Hydramnios Placental Factors: Minor degree placenta previa with marginal insertion of the cord. Long umbilical cord. Iatrogenic Factors: Low rupture of membranes Manual rotation of the head External cephalic version (ECV) Internal podalic version (IPV) Management of cord prolapse is based on Baby's status (living or dead) Baby's maturity Degree of cervical dilation Living baby Definitive treatment Cesarean Section (Best option for mature, living babies) If immediate Safe Vaginal Delivery Possible: Head Engaged: Complete delivery with forceps (ventouse is less ideal). Breech Presentation: Complete delivery by breech extraction. If immediate Safe Vaginal Delivery Not Possible Minimise cord pressure until definitive treatment or transfer to a suitable hospital. Stop any ongoing oxytocin infusion. Bladder Filling: Use a Foley catheter to fill the bladder with 400–750 mL fluid—empty the bladder before cesarean delivery. Postural Treatment: Use an elevated Sims position with a pillow or wedge; Cord Replacement: Place the cord back into the vagina to reduce vasospasm. Baby Dead Allow labour to proceed for spontaneous delivery.

Trial of labour refers to the conduction of spontaneous labour in cases of minor to moderate cephalopelvic disproportion under institutional supervision, intending to achieve vaginal delivery. Aims of trial of labour: Avoid unnecessary cesarean sections and deliver a healthy baby. Originally used to test pelvic adequacy, it is now used to evaluate uterine scar integrity. Decrease the need for preterm induction. Contraindications of the trial of labour: Midpelvic and outlet contraction. Elderly primigravida. Malpresentation. Postmaturity. Preeclampsia.

      "explanation": "Correct Answer: D) Clinical pelvimetry Explanation: Clinical pelvimetry is the best method of assessing the pelvis, and the fetal head is the best pelvimeter. Cephalopelvic disproportion is the disparity in the head and pelvis size. It can be assessed via Clinical pelvimetry. Imaging pelvimetry. Cephalometry. Clinical pelvimetry can be of two methods : Abdominal method Abdominovaginal method (Muller - Munro Kerr) Limitations of Clinical Assessment: It is only applicable to note the presence or absence of disproportion at the brim. Not applicable to elicit midpelvic or outlet contraction. It is less useful for transverse diameter contraction. Degrees of disproportion Severe Disproportion: Obstetric conjugate < 7.5 cm (3”) Borderline Disproportion: Obstetric conjugate between 9.5 cm and 10 cm. USG pelvimetry (Option A): It is used to assess the biparietal diameter accurately, but it is not the best assessment method. MR pelvimetry (Option B): It is also useful for assessing the fetal size, head volume, and pelvic soft tissue. However, it does not offer sufficient accuracy in predicting the need for cesarean delivery due to dystocia. X-ray pelvimetry (Option C): A lateral X-ray evaluates the pelvic inlet, mid-pelvis, and pelvic outlet. But now obsolete as it has a low predictive value for diagnosing cephalopelvic disproportion (CPD)",

      "explanation": "Correct Answer: C) Diagonal conjugate Explanation: The diagonal conjugate is the distance from the lower border of the pubic symphysis to the sacral promontory. It is a key measurement used to detect pelvic contraction at the brim. The Salient features to be noted to detect pelvic contraction are: Brim Midpelvis Outlet Diagonal conjugate Posterior surface of the symphysis pubis Iliopectineal line Sacrosciatic notch Sacrum Ischial spines Interspinous diameter Sacrosciatic notch Sidewalls Sidewalls Sacrococcygeal joint Subpubic arch Subpubic angle Transverse diameter Interspinous diameter (Option A) measures the distance between the ischial spines. It can encroach into the vaginal cavity and diminishes the available space. It is an important dimension in the mid-pelvis, not at the brim. Pelvic sidewalls (Option B) refer to the lateral walls of the pelvis. Normally, they are parallel and divergent, but they become convergent in the contracted pelvis. This is a salient feature to assess for contraction at the mid-pelvis or the outlet, not the brim. Subpubic angle (Option D) is formed under the pubic symphysis by the inferior pubic rami and is assessed to determine the shape of the pelvis. The narrow subpubic angle suggests contraction at the pelvic outlet, not the brim.",

      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: C) Size and shape of the pelvis Explanation: X-ray pelvimetry is specifically used to assess the size and shape of the pelvis, which is crucial for evaluating potential cephalopelvic disproportion. Limitations of X-ray Pelvimetry: It is limited to the erect lateral view. Limited in diagnosing pelvic contraction or cephalopelvic disproportion. It cannot assess factors critical to successful vaginal delivery, such as fetal size, presentation, position, and uterine contraction strength. (Option A and B) Ineffective in predicting vaginal delivery success, especially in breech presentations or previous cesarean cases. Useful in cases with pelvic fractures and for measuring diameters inaccessible through clinical examination. Fetal size and head position (Option A): X-ray pelvimetry does not provide information about the size and position of the fetal head. These are assessed through ultrasound and clinical examination. Strength of uterine contractions (Option B): The strength of uterine contractions cannot be evaluated with X-ray pelvimetry. This is monitored clinically during labour. Progress of labour (Option D): The progress of labour is not determined by X-ray pelvimetry but through clinical observations and cervical examinations during labour.

(Normal is 15 cm). Pelvic inlet contraction is defined by: Obstetric conjugate <10 cm Greatest transverse diameter <12 cm Diagonal conjugate <11 cm A contracted mid-pelvis is diagnosed when the sum of the interstitial spinous and posterior sagittal diameters is 13 cm or less. A contracted outlet is suspected when the interischial tuberous diameter is 8 cm or less. This is often associated with mid-pelvic contraction, while isolated outlet contraction is rare. Obstetric conjugate and greatest transverse diameter refers to measurements relevant to the pelvic inlet and not the mid pelvis, where the obstetric conjugate should be at least 10 cm, and the greatest transverse diameter should be at least 12 cm, not to indicate contraction. (Option A and B ) Interischial tuberous diameter refers to the pelvic outlet, where an interischial tuberous diameter of 8 cm or less indicates contraction. (Option D)",
