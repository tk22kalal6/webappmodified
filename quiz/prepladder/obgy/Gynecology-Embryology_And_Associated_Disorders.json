      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: B) Bartholin’s gland cyst Explanation: The presentation is consistent with Bartholin's Gland Cyst, which results from the obstruction of Bartholin's gland duct. Cyst characteristics: Painless, smooth, cystic swelling in the inferior labia majora or posterior vestibule near the fourchette. Gland characteristics: Bilateral, 0.5 to 1 cm in diameter, located deep to vestibular bulb and bulbospongiosus muscle. Complication: Infection can lead to abscess formation. Common Pathogens: E. coli, gram-positive/negative aerobes, anaerobes. Clinical Features: Unnoticed when small. Larger cysts cause local discomfort and dyspareunia. Unilateral swelling on posterior labium majora, projecting medially, making vulvar cleft 'S'-shaped. Treatment: Small, asymptomatic cysts require no intervention except exclusion of neoplasia in women >40 years. Symptomatic cysts are managed by incision and drainage (I&D), marsupialization, or Bartholin gland excision. Gartner's duct cyst ( Option A): Remnant of Wolffian duct located along the anterolateral vaginal walls. Mostly asymptomatic; detected incidentally. If large, it can cause discomfort, urinary issues, or dyspareunia; hence, it is surgically removed. Skene's Duct Cyst (Option C): Occurs due to obstruction of Skene's glands near the urethral meatus. They are located at the sides of the urethral meatus, not near the vaginal opening, ruling them out. Nabothian cyst (Option D): Nabothian cysts are benign cysts that develop on the cervix due to blocked cervical glands. They appear as smooth, clear, pale white or yellow rounded elevations on the cervix. They are not located in the labium majora and do not present as a swelling near the vaginal opening.",

      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: C) Transverse vaginal septum Explanation: The given case scenario is suggestive of Transverse vaginal septum , a vertical fusion defect presenting as cryptomenorrhea (hidden menstruation). In cryptomenorrhea, menstruation occurs but is not expelled due to an obstruction of the outflow tract. It comprises of: Hematocolpos (distension of vagina with blood) Hematometra (distension of the uterus with blood) Hematosalpinx (distension of fallopian tubes with blood) Vertical fusion defects : Transverse vaginal septum Imperforate hymen Vaginal atresia Cervico vaginal atresia Mullerian agenesis Aspect Transverse vaginal septum (Option C) Imperforate hymen (Option B) Etiology Vertical fusion defect or faulty canalization of urogenital sinus and Müllerian ducts Failure of central cells of Müllerian eminence to disintegrate projecting into the urogenital sinus.

Mullerian agenesis is failure of the Müllerian ducts to develop, resulting in congenital absence of the uterus and the upper two-thirds of the vagina, while the ovaries and external genitalia are normal. Asherman Syndrome (Option A): This condition causes intrauterine adhesions, usually after surgery or infection, resulting in amenorrhea. Patients typically lack cyclic pelvic pain or hematocolpos due to improper shedding of the endometrial lining. Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS) (Option D): PCOS features irregular or absent menstrual cycles, hirsutism, and polycystic ovaries on ultrasound. Secondary amenorrhea is common, but",

      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: A) Testicular Feminization Syndrome Explanation: Testicular Feminization Syndrome, or Androgen Insensitivity Syndrome (AIS), is caused by mutations in the androgen receptor gene (AR), impairing androgen signaling. Individuals with a 46, XY karyotype develop a female phenotype with sparse or absent axillary and pubic hair, normal breast development, and a eunuchoidal body habitus. Internal examination shows absent uterus and ovaries. Testes present in the abdominal/ inguinal or labial region. Swyer syndrome (Option C), also known as Complete Gonadal Dysgenesis, presents with primary amenorrhea, absent secondary sexual characteristics, and having a 46, XY karyotype. Gonads are typically fibrous or streak-like due to incomplete gonadal development unlike testis seen in AIS. Turner syndrome (Option D) results from the complete or partial absence of one X chromosome (45 X or variants), leading to primary amenorrhea, underdeveloped secondary sexual characteristics, short stature, and streak gonads (fibrous ovaries).",

      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: B) Early gonadectomy and long-term estrogen replacement therapy Explanation: Individuals with AIS who are assigned female at birth have an increased risk of gonadal malignancy (gonadoblastoma or dysgerminoma). Therefore, early removal of the testes (gonadectomy) is recommended. Estrogen replacement therapy is needed to induce and maintain female secondary sexual characteristics and to support vaginal health. Treatment of Testicular Feminization Syndrome Female Gender Assignment (Reared as a girl) Male Gender Assignment (Conversion as a male) Gonadectomy: Testes (which are ectopic and present in the abdomen or inguinal canal) are typically removed due to the high risk of gonadal malignancy (20-30% risk), specifically gonadoblastoma or dysgerminoma (Option B). Timing: Gonadectomy is usually performed at the start of puberty. Estrogen Replacement Therapy: After gonadectomy, long-term estrogen therapy is prescribed to induce and maintain secondary sexual characteristics (such as breast development) and for the health of the vaginal epithelium (Option B) . Vaginoplasty: Reconstruction of the vagina is considered after completion of growth (around 16-18 years of age) to allow for normal sexual function. Surgical and Medical Management: The decision to transition to male involves considerations such as the size of the phallus and the feasibility of constructing a penile urethra (Option C). Testosterone Therapy: Testosterone is administered to induce virilization and promote the development of male secondary sexual characteristics, including enlargement of the phallus. (Option A) Timing: Testosterone therapy may begin before puberty to maximize its effects on phallic growth, especially in cases of 5-alpha reductase deficiency.

      "explanation": "Correct Answer: B) Androstenedione Explanation: Androstenedione is the immediate precursor to Testosterone. It is converted to Testosterone by the enzyme 17 β OH Steroid Dehydrogenase. Dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) (Option A) is an intermediate in the pathway, but it is not the direct precursor to Testosterone. It needs to be converted to Androstenedione first. 17 OH Pregnenolone (Option C) is an upstream intermediate in the pathway, leading to the formation of DHEA and, subsequently, Androstenedione, but it is not the direct precursor to Testosterone. Estrone (Option D) is an estrogen and is not involved in the direct biosynthesis of Testosterone. It is a product of the aromatization of Androstenedione.

      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: B) Congenital Adrenal Hyperplasia (CAH) Explanation: In the above clinical scenario, the patient presented with the symptoms of androgen excess including signs of hirsutism, clitoromegaly, and rapid growth. Congenital adrenal hyperplasia is a group of inherited disorders affecting the adrenal glands. The most common cause is the deficiency of the 21-hydroxylase enzyme, leading to excess production of ACTH and androgens causing peripheral precocious puberty. Non classic form of CAH presents in the adolescent female with the above-mentioned symptoms. 17-hydroxy progesterone, substrate of the enzyme 21-hydroxylase is accumulated in the blood and used in the diagnosis. Premature thelarche (Option A): Early development of breast tissue in girls, typically before the age of 8, without other signs of puberty. It is seen due to excess estrogens, not androgens. Central precocious puberty(Option C): In central precocious puberty, puberty begins earlier than usual due to the premature activation of the HPG axis. CAH is a cause of peripheral precocious puberty, not central. Turner syndrome (Option D) is caused by a severe structural abnormality of one X chromosome in a phenotypic female (45X0). It is the most common form of gonadal dysgenesis that leads to primary ovarian insufficiency. Secondary sexual development is absent; ambiguous genitalia- not present.",

      "explanation": "Correct Answer: A) Swyer Syndrome Explanation: Swyer syndrome is a male pseudohermaphrodite, a pure 46 XY gonadal dysgenesis with the presence of a uterus and a cervix but with hypoestrogenism and poorly developed breasts. Undeveloped testes do not secrete testosterone and Mullerian inhibiting factors resulting in the development of female genital organs and female phenotype. Turner Syndrome(Option B): It usually involves a 45, X karyotype and is characterized by features such as short stature and a webbed neck. The presence of a 46, XY karyotype does not fit Turner syndrome. Mixed Gonadal dysgenesis (Option C): This typically involves a 45XO/46XY mosaic karyotype and ambiguous genitalia. The presence of normal female external genitalia and a 46, XY karyotype suggests Swyer syndrome rather than mixed gonadal dysgenesis. Androgen Insensitivity Syndrome (AIS)(Option D): AIS involves a 46, XY karyotype, female external genitalia, and typically well-developed breasts due to the body's insensitivity to androgens. The absence of breast development and the presence of streak gonads are inconsistent with AIS. Diagnosis Turner’s Syndrome Mixed Gonadal Dysgenesis Swyer Syndrome Clinical Presentation Primary amenorrhea Poor secondary sexual characters Short stature Webbing of neck Cubitus valgus Underdeveloped genitalia At birth: Ambiguous sex At Puberty: Virilism with amenorrhea External genitalia: partial masculinisation Internal genitalia may have unilateral Mullerian development Amenorrhea Secondary sex characteristics absent Female external genitalia Diagnostic Criteria Karyotype 45, XO Bilateral streak gonads Serum:E2 I and FSH I Karyotype : 45 X0 / 46 XY Gonads: Testis on one side and on the other side a ‘streak’ Karyotype 46 XY Fibrous gonadal tissues Female internal genitalia Reproductive Outcome Pregnancy with donor oocyte Depends on anatomic sex Rare with IVF and donor oocytes Reference: Williams Gynecology, 4th Edition, Page 375, 376, 377.",
