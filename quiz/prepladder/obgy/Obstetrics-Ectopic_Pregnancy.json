Explanation: Low serum progesterone levels can help differentiate between ectopic and intrauterine pregnancies, as lower levels are often associated with non-viable pregnancies, including ectopic pregnancies. Serum progesterone levels: >25 ng/ml indicates viable intrauterine pregnancy < 5 ng/ml indicates non-viable intrauterine pregnancy or ectopic pregnancy (Option A) Higher progesterone levels are generally indicative of a normal, viable intrauterine pregnancy (Option C) Progesterone is not used as a treatment for ectopic pregnancies.

      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "on ultrasound is a key diagnostic finding indicative of a ruptured ectopic pregnancy, often representing blood from the rupture. Investigations for ectopic pregnancy: Blood examination should be done as a routine for: Haemoglobin ABO and Rh grouping Total white cell count and differential count Erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) Estimation of β -hCG: The suspicious findings are: Lower concentration of β -hCG compared to normal intrauterine pregnancy Plasma concentration does not double in 48 hours like in normal pregnancy Sonography (TVS): The diagnostic features are: Absence of intrauterine pregnancy with a positive pregnancy test. Fluid (echogenic) in the pouch of Douglas. Adnexal mass clearly separated from the ovary (Blob sign). Rarely cardiac motion may be seen in an unruptured tubal ectopic pregnancy. Combination of quantitative β -hCG values and sonography: TVS provides visualization of a well-formed intrauterine gestational sac as early as 4–5 weeks from the last menstrual period. The lowest level of serum β -hCG at which a gestational sac is consistently visible using TVS (discriminatory zone) is ≥ 1,500 IU/L.So if the beta-hCG level is ≥ 1,500 and no intrauterine pregnancy is seen, an ectopic pregnancy is highly suspected. Laparoscopy offers benefits in cases of confusion with other pelvic lesions. Dilatation and curettage: Identification of decidua without villi structure is suggestive. Serum progesterone: A level greater than 25 ng/mL is suggestive of viable intrauterine pregnancy whereas a level less than 5 ng/mL suggests an ectopic or abnormal intrauterine pregnancy. Laparotomy offers benefits when in doubt. Elevated serum hCG (Option A) levels and the presence of a gestational sac (Option B) in the uterine cavity are not specific to a ruptured ectopic pregnancy. Absence of adnexal mass on the pelvic exam (Option D): The absence of an adnexal mass on the pelvic exam does not rule out an ectopic pregnancy, especially if a rupture has occurred.

Total salpingectomy is done and not partial salpingectomy as it can potentially lead to another ectopic in the future.

      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: C) Non-clotting blood with a hematocrit greater than 15% Explanation: Culdocentesis is a diagnostic procedure that involves the aspiration of fluid from the pouch of Douglas (the rectouterine pouch) through the posterior fornix of the vagina using an 18-gauge lumbar puncture needle fitted with a syringe. This procedure is useful for diagnosing ruptured ectopic when diagnostic tools such as transvaginal ultrasound (TVS) or laparoscopy are not available. Non-clotting blood with a hematocrit greater than 15% in the aspirate suggests a ruptured ectopic pregnancy.",

      "explanation": "hCG levels ≥ 1,500 IU/L. Correct Answer: A) Absence of intrauterine pregnancy on Transabdominal sonography with beta hCG levels ≥ 1,500 IU/L Explanation: Transabdominal sonography (TAS) is less sensitive than transvaginal sonography (TVS) for early pregnancy detection. The discriminatory zone for TAS is typically β -hCG ≥ 6,000 IU/L. Therefore, the absence of an intrauterine pregnancy on TAS at a β -hCG level of ≥ 1,500 IU/L is not typically used for diagnosing ectopic pregnancy as it is not a reliable threshold for TAS . TVS should be used for a more accurate diagnosis at a β -hCG level of ≥ 1,500 IU/L. Findings for Diagnosing Unruptured Ectopic Pregnancy Diagnostic Modality Findings for Unruptured Ectopic Pregnancy Transvaginal Sonography (TVS) Absence of Intrauterine Pregnancy: No gestational sac within the uterine cavity when β -hCG ≥ 1500 IU/L.

      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "than angular pregnancy. Correct Answer: C) Cornual pregnancy is typically associated with a thicker myometrial mantle than angular pregnancy. Explanation: Cornual pregnancy implants in the interstitial part of the fallopian tube or rudimentary horn, where the myometrial mantle is thin or absent. Angular pregnancy implants within the uterine cavity’s lateral angle, medial to the round ligament, and usually has a thicker myometrial mantle (>5 mm). Hence, cornual pregnancy does not have a thicker myometrium than angular pregnancy, making option C false. Angular Pregnancy vs Cornual Pregnancy: Feature Angular Pregnancy Cornual (Interstitial) Pregnancy Definition Implantation in the lateral angle of the uterine cavity, medial to the round ligament and near the uterotubal junction Implantation in the interstitial segment of the fallopian tube (within uterine wall but outside uterine cavity) or in a rudimentary horn of a malformed uterus Location Intrauterine but eccentric (lateral uterine angle) Extrauterine (interstitial segment) or rudimentary horn Relation to Round Ligament Medial to round ligament Lateral to round ligament (interstitial); variable in rudimentary horn Interstitial line sign Absent Present (specific finding on ultrasound) Myometrial Mantle Thickness Typically thick (>5 mm) Thin or absent, especially in rudimentary horn Prognosis Can progress to term but carries a high risk of rupture and hemorrhage High risk of early rupture and hemorrhage, especially in rudimentary horn Outcome May result in live birth but with significant risk Rarely progresses to term; high maternal morbidity risk Diagnosis Difficult; relies on imaging and relation to round ligament Difficult; imaging important to distinguish from angular pregnancy The presence of an interstitial line sign on ultrasound is more specific for cornual pregnancy than for angular pregnancy (Option A): Correct. The interstitial line sign is a hallmark of cornual pregnancy and helps distinguish it from angular pregnancy. Angular pregnancy is located medial to the round ligament (Option B): Correct and is a defining feature. Angular pregnancy carries a higher risk of uterine rupture compared to normal intrauterine pregnancy (Option D): Correct as it has increased risk of rupture and hemorrhage compared to normal pregnancy.
