A Bartholin’s abscess occurs when the duct is blocked by fibrosis, causing exudates to build up inside the gland. If left untreated, the abscess may burst through the lower vaginal wall, leaving a sinus tract that periodically discharges. Treatment of Bartholin’s abscess: Rest Analgesics to relieve pain Daily sitz bath Incision and drainage Systemic antibiotics such as: Ampicillin 500 mg orally every 8 hours Tetracycline (in the case of chlamydia infection) Option A) Bartholin’s Cyst is a painless swelling that does not cause fever and mostly remains unnoticed.

      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Correct answer: C) Hematogenous Spread Explanation: In about 90% of cases, pelvic organs are infected with Mycobacterium tuberculosis secondarily through hematogenous spread from a primary site of infection, such as the lungs. Other modes of transmission: Direct spread of tuberculosis to the reproductive organs is possible from an infected adjacent organ, but this is less common than hematogenous spread. Ascending spread of tuberculosis from the cervix to the fallopian tubes is rare. Sexual transmission of tuberculosis to the reproductive organs is possible, but it is less likely than other routes of spread.

        "D": "TB will resolve on its own without treatment."
      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: B) Direct spread of TB may occur from the fallopian tubes to the uterus. body, most commonly the lungs. The most common route of spread to the uterus is hematogenous (90% of cases). Hematogenous spread: The bacteria travel via the bloodstream from a primary infection site, usually the lungs, to the uterus. This is the most common route because tuberculosis primarily affects the lungs and can disseminate to other organs through the blood. Direct extension from the abdominal cavity and Lymphatic spread from the inguinal nodes: TB can spread through the lymphatic system or directly from the infected organs, but this is not the primary or most common route for genital TB. Genital TB often starts in the fallopian tubes and can spread directly to adjacent structures, including the uterus. This is due to the anatomical proximity and the continuity of the mucosal surfaces. In the absence of treatment, TB can extend from the fallopian tubes to the endometrium, leading to endometrial TB. This form of spread is termed direct or contiguous spread and is a common pathway for genital TB progression. Ascending infection from the lower genital tract: This route is more typical of bacterial infections like gonorrhea or chlamydia, not TB. TB bacteria rarely spread in this manner. Other Options: Hysterosalpingography (HSG) can be done to check tubal patency (False): Performing HSG in the presence of active genital TB is contraindicated due to the risk of exacerbating the infection and spreading TB to other parts of the genital tract or the peritoneal cavity. Hematogenous spread will occur from the fallopian tubes to the uterus (False): While hematogenous spread is a primary mechanism for the initial seeding of TB to the genital tract, once TB has been established, the local spread from one genital organ to another is typically through direct extension, not hematogenous spread. TB will resolve on its own without treatment (False): Antitubercular therapy (ATT) is essential to effectively treat TB, prevent its spread, and reduce the risk of severe outcomes and infertility.

      },
      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: C) During the late premenstrual phase Explanation: The optimal time to perform an endometrial biopsy for diagnosing endometrial tuberculosis is during the late premenstrual phase of the menstrual cycle. The tubercle is found in the basal layer of the endometrium and moves to the surface before menstruation. Following the shedding of the endometrium during menstruation, reinfection arises from the basal layer lesions or the fallopian tubes. Layers affected: Endometrial tuberculosis typically affects the endometrial layer (60%) while sparing the myometrium. Endometrial biopsy is done during the premenstrual period by D&C or hysteroscopy directed biopsy. Menstrual blood collected on the first day of menstruation (superficial layer is shed off) can also be used as a diagnostic sample because it may contain the bacilli responsible for the infection.

      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: C) Genital Tuberculosis Explanation: In this clinical scenario, the patient's history and physical examination findings raise high suspicion of genital tuberculosis (TB). The key points include: History of secondary amenorrhea and pelvic pain : These are common presentations in genital TB. Secondary amenorrhea is the most common presenting symptom. Intermittent fever and weight loss : These systemic symptoms are often associated with TB in general. Physical examination finding of adnexal mass and lower abdominal tenderness : These findings can suggest the presence of pelvic inflammatory disease, which can be due to genital TB. Other points that raise suspicion of genital TB: Chronic symptoms such as pelvic pain, menstrual abnormalities such as menorrhagia or oligomenorrhea. Past history of TB or exposure to someone with TB. Infertility (Primary or secondary) Physical Examination Findings in Genital TB: Tenderness in the lower abdomen, often with palpable adnexal masses. Pelvic examination may reveal thickened tubes, nodularity, or mass formation due to tuberculous salpingitis or tuberculous tubo-ovarian abscess. Option A ) Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS): PCOS is less commonly associated with significant weight loss, fever, or pelvic pain.Physical examination in PCOS may reveal features such as ovarian enlargement with multiple small follicles, but not typically palpable adnexal masses or tenderness. Option B) Endometriosis: Endometriosis can cause pelvic pain and infertility but is less likely to present with significant weight loss and systemic symptoms like fever. Physical examination does not typically have palpable adnexal masses unless complicated by endometriotic cysts. Option D ) Ectopic Pregnancy: Can present with pelvic pain and adnexal mass, but it wouldn't typically cause secondary amenorrhea and weight loss without severe complications like rupture.

Correct answer: B) Laparoscopy is mainly used to assess the extent of tubal damage in genital TB, and it allows for direct visualization and biopsy of the affected tissues. Explanation: Laparoscopy is a crucial tool for diagnosing genital TB because it permits direct visualization of the pelvic organs, identification of lesions, and allows for biopsy collection and fluid aspiration for culture, which is essential for a definitive diagnosis. USG, while useful for identifying abnormalities and guiding further investigation, cannot definitively diagnose genital TB or assess tubal damage as accurately as laparoscopy can (also assess feasibility of adhiolysis in severe distortion).

Correct answer: C) Antitubercular therapy is the first-line treatment, but surgery may be necessary in cases of extensive adhesions, tubal blockages, or when there is a suspicion of an abscess. Explanation: Antitubercular chemotherapy is the treatment of the first choice. However, in cases where there are complications such as extensive adhesions, tubal blockages, or abscesses, surgical intervention may be necessary to address these issues and improve fertility outcomes. Surgery is not typically the first-line treatment but is considered when medical management alone is insufficient.
