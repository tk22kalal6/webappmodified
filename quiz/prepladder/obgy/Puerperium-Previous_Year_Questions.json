Devices like the Bakri balloon, Sengstaken-Blakemore tube, or Foley catheter are inserted into the uterus and inflated with sterile fluid to provide direct mechanical compression of bleeding vessels. It is also useful in surgical or traumatic pelvic hemorrhage to prevent excessive blood loss. An umbrella pack (Option B) is a surgical packing technique for severe pelvic hemorrhage, mainly used after hysterectomy, placenta accreta spectrum, or trauma-related pelvic bleeding. A plastic bag filled with gauze rolls is inserted transabdominally, with a stalk exiting vaginally. Mild traction is applied using a fluid bag, allowing continuous compression—functioning like an umbrella expanding within the pelvis to tamponade bleeding. A parachute pack (Option C) is a variation of the umbrella pack, primarily used in diffuse pelvic bleeding, especially after peripartum hysterectomy, placenta percreta, or coagulopathy.

      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: B) Primaquine Explanation: Primaquine is specifically used in the post-partum period of malarial infection with P. vivax. Artemether (Option A): This medication is primarily used in combination with lumefantrine for acute treatment of uncomplicated P. falciparum malaria. While effective against blood stages, it does not prevent P. vivax relapses as it has no activity against hypnozoites. Quinine (Option C): Although safe during pregnancy, quinine acts only on blood-stage parasites and cannot prevent relapses. It is primarily used for treating acute malaria episodes during pregnancy when other options are contraindicated. Artesunate (Option D): Intravenous artesunate is the preferred treatment for severe malaria but does not prevent P. vivax relapses. It is used in life-threatening cases during pregnancy but has no effect on hypnozoites. Reference: Williams Obstetrics, 26th Edition, Page 1199 https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6532739/",

      "explanation": "Correct Answer: B) 6 months Explanation: The recommended duration for exclusive breastfeeding is 6 months. Exclusive Breastfeeding: Only breast milk for the first 6 months No additional food or drinks Exceptions: oral rehydration solutions, drops/syrups of vitamins, minerals, or medicines Provides optimal nutrition and health benefits to infant 3 months (Option A) : While three months of exclusive breastfeeding provides some benefits, it is insufficient for optimal infant development. According to protocol, continuing exclusive breastfeeding for a full six months is recommended. Nine months (Option C) : By nine months, infants should already be receiving complementary foods alongside breast milk . Exclusive breastfeeding at this stage would not meet the growing nutritional needs of the developing infant. Twelve months (Option D) : Although breastfeeding can continue for 12 months or longer, exclusive breastfeeding should not extend beyond six month. At this stage, infants require additional nutrients from complementary foods while continuing to receive breast milk. Reference: Nelson Textbook of Pediatrics, 21st Edition, Page 314-315",

      "question": "A 25-year-old lady had an uneventful vaginal delivery. On postpartum day 1, she presented with postpartum hemorrhage and complains of visual changes and severe headache. A few hours after the complaint, she is found to be in an unresponsive state and is intubated and put on ventilation.

        "C": "Thyroxine",
        "D": "Activated protein C"
      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: B) Steroids Explanation: The scenario described suggests Sheehan's syndrome, which is caused by pituitary apoplexy (hemorrhagic infarction of the pituitary) due to massive blood loss during childbirth. The treatment of choice for Sheehan’s syndrome is hormone replacement, starting with glucocorticoids (steroids), followed by other hormone replacements like thyroid hormone, sex steroids, and possibly growth hormone. Steroids are particularly critical in this emergency because they help stabilize the cardiovascular system and reverse the shock caused by adrenal insufficiency. Immediate volume resuscitation and glucocorticoid therapy are essential in managing this condition. Sheehan Syndrome Definition Postpartum hypopituitarism caused by ischemic necrosis of the pituitary gland following severe postpartum hemorrhage. Symptoms • Failure to lactate • Hypotension • Hypoglycemia • fatigue • amenorrhea • Hypothyroidism • adrenal insufficiency • decreased libido • weight gain • cold intolerance Diagnosis • Clinical history of severe postpartum hemorrhage. • Hormonal evaluation: Low levels of pituitary hormones (prolactin, TSH, ACTH, LH, FSH, growth hormone). • MRI: Empty sella or reduced pituitary size. Treatment Lifelong hormone replacement therapy (glucocorticoids, levothyroxine, estrogen-progesterone, growth hormone if needed) Dobutamine (Option A) is a sympathomimetic drug that is used for heart failure and shock, primarily to increase cardiac output by improving contractility. However, it is not the primary treatment for Sheehan’s syndrome, which is an endocrine emergency requiring hormone replacement, particularly glucocorticoids. Thyroxine (Option C) is used in the treatment of hypothyroidism, but in the case of Sheehan's syndrome, the most critical treatment initially is steroids to address acute adrenal insufficiency. Thyroxine would be required later as part of the hormone replacement regimen once the patient is stable. Activated protein C (Option D) is used to treat conditions related to hypercoagulability such as sepsis-associated disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), but it is not indicated for Sheehan's syndrome.",

      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Correct answer: B) High estrogen Explanation: Milk production in pregnancy is inhibited by high estrogen. Lactogenesis: Refers to the initiation of milk secretion and encompasses the changes in the mammary epithelium that transform the undifferentiated mammary gland during early pregnancy into a fully functional lactating gland after childbirth. Prolactin: Stimulates milk production by promoting mammary gland ductal growth, epithelial cell proliferation, and milk protein synthesis. Inhibition of Milk Secretion During Pregnancy: High estrogen and progesterone levels prevent the breast tissues from responding to prolactin, despite high prolactin levels. Following Delivery: Rapid drop in progesterone and estrogen levels triggers prolactin activity, leading to milk production in fully developed mammary glands. Oxytocin: Involved in milk ejection, causing contraction of myoepithelial cells, and also supports maternal bonding and stress reduction. Maintenance of Lactation: Regular milk removal and nipple stimulation trigger prolactin and oxytocin release.

        "D": "2350 Kcal, 2150 Kcal"
      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: B) 2110 Kcal, 2010 Kcal Explanation: Caloric Requirement for Arjun (Sedentary Male): According to the ICMR 2020 guidelines, sedentary adult men require 2110 Kcal/day for maintaining energy balance. Caloric Requirement for Arjun’s Wife (Sedentary Pregnant Woman in the Second Trimester): Sedentary adult women require 1660 Kcal/day, and during pregnancy, an additional 340 Kcal/day is recommended. This brings the total caloric requirement for a sedentary pregnant woman in her second trimester to 2010 Kcal/day. During pregnancy, the nutritional requirements of the mother increase to support fetal growth and development. Here's the breakdown of energy needs during pregnancy: First trimester: Energy requirements are generally the same as for non-pregnant women. Second trimester : Energy intake should increase by 340 kcal per day, though 300 kcal is commonly recommended, according to ICMR guidelines. Third trimester: Energy intake increases further by 452 kcal per day, with a recommended 300 kcal intake, according to ICMR. Therefore, the recommended increase in caloric intake for a pregnant woman at 12 weeks (in the second trimester) is 300 kcal per day.

      "question": "A mother of a 5-day-old baby presents with the complaint that her baby is “unable to latch on” for breastfeeding. She also says there is some leakage of milk at times, and on examination, there is bilateral tenderness and swelling. What is the most likely cause of this?",
      "options": {
        "A": "Bacterial mastitis",
        "B": "Breast abscess",
        "C": "Lactational mastitis",
        "D": "Breast engorgement"
      },
      "correct_answer": "D",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: D) Breast engorgement Explanation: Based on the given information, the most likely cause of the mother's symptoms is breast engorgement. Breast engorgement is a common condition that occurs in the early postpartum period when there is excessive swelling and fullness of the breasts. This often results in difficulty with the baby latching properly. The leakage of milk, as well as the bilateral tenderness and swelling, align with the symptoms of breast engorgement. This condition typically arises in the first few days after childbirth due to hormonal changes that increase blood flow, milk production, and fluid accumulation in the breasts. If the baby is not effectively breastfeeding or emptying the breasts, engorgement can occur. Bacterial mastitis (Option A) usually presents with localized redness, warmth, pain, and swelling of the breast, often accompanied by flu-like symptoms such as fever and body aches. While tenderness and swelling are present in the case, the information provided does not suggest the presence of systemic symptoms commonly associated with bacterial mastitis. A breast abscess (Option B) is a localized collection of pus within the breast tissue. It typically occurs as a complication of untreated mastitis. The presence of bilateral tenderness and swelling is not consistent with a breast abscess, as it usually involves a specific area of the breast and may present with a visible fluctuant mass or localized pain. Lactational mastitis (Option C) refers to inflammation of the breast tissue, often caused by milk stasis or blocked milk ducts. It can lead to redness, pain, and swelling in the affected area. While lactational mastitis is a possibility, the bilateral tenderness and swelling described in the case suggest a more generalized breast engorgement rather than a localized inflammation.
