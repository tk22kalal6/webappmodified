      "explanation": "Correct Answer: A) Placenta previa Explanations Antepartum Hemorrhage (APH) is defined as bleeding from or into the genital tract after the 28th week of pregnancy but before the birth of the baby. Causes of antepartum haemorrhage: Cause Definition Placenta previa (Option A) The placenta is implanted partially or completely over the lower uterine segment, causing bleeding as the cervix dilates. Most common (~33%) Placental abruption (Option B) Premature separation of the placenta from the uterine wall. Causes include hypertension, trauma, and smoking. Second most common Uterine rupture (Option C) Tearing of the uterine wall. Risk factors include previous cesarean section, large baby, and prolonged labour. Rare but serious Vasa Previa (Option D) Fetal blood vessels cross the cervix, leading to bleeding when membranes rupture or during labour (rare). Local cervical lesions Includes polyps and carcinoma. Circumvallate placenta Fetal membranes fold back over the edge of the placenta. Indeterminate bleeding Vaginal bleeding in late pregnancy without a clear cause. Possible causes include rupture of the marginal sinus or excessive show. Reference: Dutta Obstetrics 9th edition, page 228",

      "explanation": "Correct Answer : C) Marginal Placenta Previa Explanation : The image shows the edge of the placenta reaching up to the margin of the internal os but not covering it. This is known as marginal placenta previa. Types of placenta previa: Types Definitions I Low lying (Option D ruled out) The placenta is implanted in the lower uterine segment but does not reach the internal os. II Marginal The edge of the placenta is at the margin of the internal os. III Incomplete/partial central (Option B ruled out) The placenta partially covers the internal os of the cervix. IV Central/complete (Option A ruled out) The placenta completely covers the internal os of the cervix. Types I and II can be anterior or posterior. Types I and II are minor degrees, and types III and IV are major degrees of placenta previa. Type 2 posterio r is known as dangerous placenta previa as it is more likely to be compressed, producing cord compression. This can lead to fetal asphyxia and death.

      "explanation": "implementation of the McAfee Johnson regimen Correct Answer: B) Expectant management with periodic transvaginal ultrasounds (TVS) and implementation of the McAfee Johnson regimen Explanation: The recommended management involves expectant management in a stable case of placenta previa with no active bleeding or other complications. This includes periodic Transvaginal ultrasound (TVS) monitoring and following the McAfee and Johnson regimen. McAfee and Johnson regime: It is an expectant management strategy for patients with placenta previa to ensure maternal and fetal safety while aiming to prolong the pregnancy. Indications: The mother is healthy (Hb >10 g % and haematocrit > 30%). Absence of active vaginal bleeding. Gestational age <37 weeks. Reactive CTG. Steps in McAfee and Johnson regime: Hospitalise the patient (Bed rest). Monitoring: Maternal vitals. Fetal heart sounds. Bleeding. Arrange for blood. If the patient is Rh (-ve), anti-D should be given. Injection of corticosteroids to hasten lung maturity of the fetus. Short-term tocolytic (nifedipine) should be provided if any contractions are present. If pregnancy <32 weeks: MgSO 4 (neural protection). The above-mentioned steps are continued till 37 weeks, after which elective cesarean section can be done. Reference: Dutta Textbook of Obstetrics, 9th edition, page 234",

      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: C) Immediate cesarean delivery Explanation: In the management of unstable placenta previa with ongoing bleeding at or after 37 weeks of pregnancy, the priority is active/definite management with immediate cesarean delivery. Active/Definite management: Indications: Unstable maternal vitals. Active bleeding present. Period of gestation: > 37 weeks. ≥ 34 weeks with extreme blood loss. Fetal distress on CTG. USG showing fetal anomaly incompatible with life. Mode of delivery: Practically, all women with placenta previa undergo cesarean delivery to prevent maternal mortality. Normal delivery can be attempted if the placental edge is >2-3 cm away from the internal os. Internal examination can be done in the operating room, and induction can be done with ARM ± oxytocin. Satisfactory progress of labour → Vaginal delivery. Reference: Dutta Obstetrics, 9th Edition, Page 235,236 Williams Obstetrics, 26th Edition, Page 758, 759",

      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: B) Abruptio placenta Explanation: Abruptio placenta is a form of antepartum haemorrhage, where the bleeding occurs due to premature separation of the normally situated placenta. Pathogenesis: Bleeding occurs due to rupture of blood vessels in the decidua basalis. There is an accumulation of blood in the decidua. This causes the separation of the placenta, leading to Further bleeding. Thrombin generation from haemorrhage triggers the action of matrix metalloproteinases, inflammatory cytokines, and coagulation cascade (high risk of DIC). Fetal distress. Clinical Features: Vaginal bleeding Abdominal pain Uterine tenderness Back pain Fetal distress Hypovolemic shock Placenta previa (Option A) typically presents in the third trimester and is not associated with severe abdominal pain or fetal distress. Cervical polyp (Option C) are benign growths on the cervix that can cause intermittent bleeding. They are not typically associated with severe abdominal pain or fetal distress. Placental infarction (Option D) typically presents with chronic or intermittent bleeding and is not associated with the sudden onset of severe abdominal pain and fetal distress.

      "explanation": "Correct Answer: A) Revealed Explanation: Types of abruptio placenta: Revealed Most common type, where the bleeding from the placental detachment is visible and exits through the vagina. This is often associated with vaginal bleeding and abdominal pain. Concealed Bleeding is hidden behind the placenta and is not visible externally. Blood collects within the uterus, causing increased pressure and pain without visible bleeding. Mixed Involves both concealed and revealed bleeding. There is both internal and external bleeding, with some blood exiting through the vagina and some collecting behind the placenta. Reference: 1. Dutta Obstetrics edition 9th edition, page 237,238",

      },
      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: A) The higher the birth order, the lower the risk Explanation: When the birth order increases, the risk of placental abruption increases. Risk factors for placental abruption: General factors High birth order pregnancies with gravid ≥ 5. Advancing age of the mother. Poor socioeconomic condition. Low nutritional state. Smoking (Vasospasm). Hypertension in pregnancy Pre-eclampsia, gestational hypertension and essential hypertension are all associated (10–50%). Mechanism: Spasm of the vessels in the uteroplacental bed (decidual spiral artery) → anoxic endothelial damage → rupture of vessels and extravasation of blood in the decidua basalis (retroplacental hematoma). Trauma Traumatic separation of the placenta usually leads to its marginal separation with the escape of blood outside. The trauma may be External cephalic version, especially under anaesthesia, using great force. Road traffic accidents, blunt trauma or blows on the abdomen. Needle puncture at amniocentesis. Sudden uterine decompression It leads to the diminished surface area of the uterus adjacent to the placental attachment and results in the shearing of the placenta. Clinical situations are: Following delivery of the first baby of twins. Sudden escape of liquor amnii in polyhydramnios. Premature rupture of the membranes (PROM). Short cord Relative or absolute, mechanical pull can bring about placental separation during labour. Supine hypotension syndrome There is passive engorgement of the uterine and placental vessels, resulting in rupture and extravasation of the blood. Placental anomaly Circumvallate placenta. Folic acid deficiency Uterine factors Placenta implanted over a septum (septate uterus). Submucous fibroid. Torsion of the uterus Increased venous pressure and rupture of the veins with separation of the placenta. Cocaine abuse Increased risk of transient hypertension, vasospasm and placental abruption. Thrombophilias Inherited and acquired. Hyperhomocysteinemia It is associated with recurrent abruption. Previous h/o abruption The risk of recurrence varies from 5-17%.

Fetal distress is an indication of Cesarean section in abruptio placentae. Vaginal delivery is favoured in: Limited placental abruption. FHR tracing is reassuring. Facilities for continuous fetal monitoring are available. The prospect of vaginal delivery is soon. Placental abruption with a dead fetus. Cesarean section is favoured in: Bleeding continues, and the placental abruption is greater than in Grade 1. Severe abruption with a live fetus. An amniotomy could not be done due to an unfavourable cervix. The prospect of immediate vaginal delivery is remote despite attempts. Amniotomy failed to control bleeding. Amniotomy failed to arrest the process of abruption, evidenced by rising fundal height or the appearance of adverse features (e.g., fetal distress, falling fibrinogen level, oliguria).",
