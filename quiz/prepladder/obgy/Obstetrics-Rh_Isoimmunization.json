      "explanation": "Correct Answer: C) Maternal-fetal ABO incompatibility can increase the risk Explanation: ca Maternal-fetal ABO incompatibility n have a protective effect rather than increasing the risk of Rh isoimmunisation. The mother's existing antibodies eliminate incompatible fetal cells before they can trigger a significant immune response to the Rh antigen. Rh Isoimmunisation: Occurs when an Rh-negative mother is exposed to Rh-positive fetal blood , most commonly during delivery, miscarriage, ectopic pregnancy, or procedures like amniocentesis. This exposure sensitizes the mother’s immune system to the D antigen. (Option A) The mother's immune system , once sensitized to the Rh antigen, initially produces IgM antibodies , which cannot cross the placenta. These are usually followed by the production of IgG antibodies , which can cross the placenta and lead to hemolysis of fetal red blood cells in the subsequent pregnancies. (Option B) The prophylactic use of methergine (ergometrine) during labor, can potentially increase fetomaternal bleeding that can elevate the risk of Rh isoimmunisation by allowing more fetal red blood cells to enter the mother's circulation.

      "explanation": "µ g Correct Answer: C) 1000 µ g Explanation: Anti-D is given as 10 µg for every 1 mL of fetal whole blood, or for every 0.5 ml of fetal RBC: Maternal blood volume= 5000 ml = 5 L Fetal-Maternal Hemorrhage = 2% FMH volume = 2% of 5000 ml = 0.02 × 5000 ml = 100 ml Therefore, Anti-D dose = 10 µ g/ml × 100 ml = 1000 µ g . Kleihauer Betke Test (Acid Elution Technique): Primarily used to detect and quantify the presence of fetal red blood cells (RBCs) in the maternal circulation. This is crucial for determining the appropriate dose of anti-D immune globulin in D-negative pregnant women to prevent Rh immunization. Principle: Fetal RBCs contain hemoglobin F, which is more resistant to acid elution compared to adult hemoglobin (hemoglobin A), when immersed in a citrate buffer, the HbF remained intact while the HbA leaked out. In the KB test, maternal blood is exposed to acid, which causes adult hemoglobin to wash out (ghosts), leaving behind the more resistant fetal hemoglobin.

Her first child is Rh-positive, and she had a spontaneous abortion at 10 weeks during her second pregnancy.

        "D": "Early delivery at 34 weeks"
      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: B) Monitor fetal MCA Doppler Explanation: MCA (Middle Cerebral Artery) Doppler ultrasound is a non-invasive method to assess fetal anemia, which can occur due to Rh isoimmunization. MCA PSV >1.5 MoM for the corresponding gestational age, predicts a moderate to severe degree of fetal anemia. Currently, MCA PSV is the mainstay of fetal surveillance in a case with red cell alloimmunization. This value (between 24 and 35 weeks of gestation), is an indication of cordocentesis and intrauterine fetal transfusion Algorithm of Antenatal Management of Rh Isoimmunisation: Administer anti-D immunoglobulin immediately (Option A): Anti-D immunoglobulin is administered to Rh-negative mothers who are not sensitized (negative ICT) to prevent Rh isoimmunization. In this case, the patient already has a positive ICT with a significant titer (critical titer values > 1:16), indicating sensitization, so administering anti-D immunoglobulin will not be effective. Routine follow-up in 4 weeks (Option C) : Given the ICT with a single positive titer, routine follow-up without specific assessment for fetal anemia is not appropriate. This patient requires closer monitoring due to the risk of hemolytic disease of the fetus and newborn (HDFN) Early delivery at 34 weeks (Option D) : Early delivery might be considered if severe fetal anemia or hydrops fetalis is detected and intrauterine transfusion is not feasible or has failed. However, this decision would be based on MCA-PSV Doppler findings.",

      "explanation": "Correct Answer: A) Administer a standard prophylactic dose of anti-D immunoglobulin immediately sensitization. A Standard Prophylactic anti-D immunoglobulin should be given to all Rh-negative pregnant women at 28 weeks and within 72 hours of delivery of a Rh+ve baby. Standard 300 µg of anti-D immunoglobulin IM dose will protect a mother from fetal hemorrhage of up to 30 mL of fetal whole blood or 15 mL of fetal RBCs. Causes of Feto-Maternal Haemorrhage and Indications of Anti-D Immunoglobulin Abdominal trauma Miscarriage Medical termination of pregnancy Ectopic pregnancy Chorion villus biopsy Cordocentesis Genetic amniocentesis Delivery of an Rh-positive infant to Rh-negative mother: postpartum ECV (External Cephalic Version) Schedule a USG to check for placental abruption (Option A): While a USG may be useful to assess the placenta and fetal well-being after trauma, in the absence of symptoms such as bleeding or pain, it is not the immediate priority in managing Rh isoimmunization. The focus should be on preventing sensitization with anti-D immunoglobulin. Repeat ICT in 2 weeks to monitor for sensitization (Option C): Repeating the ICT alone is not sufficient as a preventative measure. By the time sensitization is detected on an ICT, it is too late for prophylaxis. Prophylactic anti-D immunoglobulin should be administered immediately No intervention is needed as the patient is asymptomatic (Option D): Even minor trauma can cause fetomaternal hemorrhage, and Rh-negative women should receive prophylactic anti-D immunoglobulin to prevent sensitization.

      "correct_answer": "D",
      "explanation": "∆ OD450 analysis Correct Answer: D) Amniocentesis with ∆ OD450 analysis Explanation: Amniocentesis with spectral analysis involves obtaining amniotic fluid and analyzing it for bilirubin concentration using spectrophotometric analysis ( ∆ OD450). This method indirectly assesses the severity of fetal hemolysis by measuring the presence of bilirubin, which correlates with fetal red blood cell breakdown . ∆ OD450 values are interpreted using Modified Liley's (Queenan) chart , depending upon the rise of antibody titer (>1: 8) , to guide management decisions regarding the timing of delivery or the need for intrauterine transfusion in Rh-sensitized pregnancies. Usually done after 20 weeks of pregnancy and divided into zones: Zone Clinical Presentation Management Zone 1 (Low zone) The fetus is unlikely to be affected Delivery at term is suggested Zone 2 (Mid-zone) Fetal anemia Preterm delivery after 34 weeks or IUT may be needed Zone 3 (High zone) Severe anemia (Hb < 8 g/dL) Immediate IUT (Intrauterine Transfusion) needed Doppler ultrasound of MCA-PSV (Option A) is a non-invasive method with greater sensitivity and accuracy used to assess fetal anemia by measuring blood flow velocities in the fetal brain. It focuses on blood flow dynamics(Low blood viscosity & increased blood velocity) rather than direct measurement of fetal bilirubin levels. Serial USG monitoring (Option B): Although it is crucial for general fetal surveillance, eg. for detecting fetal hydrops, anemia, fetal anomalies, and monitoring growth restriction it does not help in assessing fetal hemolysis or anemia caused by Rh isoimmunization. Fetal blood sampling (FBS) via cordocentesis (Option C) involves direct fetal blood analysis from the umbilical cord. It provides detailed information, such as fetal hematocrit, reticulocyte count, and blood group compatibility, and is used when other methods indicate severe fetal anemia, typically if MCA PSV is >1.5 MoM.",

      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: B) Monitor ICT titres Explanation: ICT is positive with a titre of 1:8 , which indicates the presence of antibodies in the mother's blood against Rh-positive blood cells. Titre level of 1:8 is relatively low, i.e., less than the critical titre (<1:16) , and does not immediately indicate severe hemolytic disease of the fetus or newborn (HDFN). The standard approach is to monitor the ICT titres over time. This helps in assessing whether the level of maternal antibodies is increasing, which could potentially impact the fetus. Administer Anti-D immunoglobulin (RhIg) (Option A): Not effective since the mother is already sensitized. Perform MCA Doppler (Option C): Not needed at this low titre level; typically done if there’s a higher risk of fetal anemia. Perform Cordocentesis (Option D): An invasive procedure reserved for cases with more severe indications, not necessary with a titre of 1:8. Reference: 1.

      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: A) Administer IM Rh immunoglobulin at 28 weeks gestation. Explanation: The standard practice is to administer a dose of anti-D immunoglobulin around 28 weeks of gestation. This timing ensures that any small amounts of Rh-positive blood that might have crossed from the fetus into the maternal circulation are neutralized before the mother can develop an immune response. This prophylaxis helps prevent the development of anti-D antibodies , which could lead to complications in the current or future pregnancies. Wait until after the delivery to administer Anti-D Immunoglobulin (Option B): While anti-D immunoglobulin is also administered after delivery if the baby is Rh-positive, the prophylactic dose at 28 weeks is crucial for preventing Rh sensitization during the pregnancy. Administer Anti-D Immunoglobulin only if there is evidence of maternal trauma or bleeding (Option C): Prophylactic anti-D immunoglobulin at 28 weeks is given regardless of whether there is evidence of trauma or bleeding, to ensure comprehensive protection against Rh sensitization. No further administration of Anti-D Immunoglobulin is needed during current pregnancy (Option D): Even though she received anti-D immunoglobulin after a previous pregnancy, a prophylactic dose at 28 weeks is still necessary in the current pregnancy to prevent sensitization.

Gestational diabetes (Option B) is not typically associated with non-immune hydrops fetalis. It primarily affects fetal growth and can lead to macrosomia (large fetus) and other metabolic issues. Mild maternal hypertension (Option D) alone is unlikely to cause non-immune hydrops fetalis. Severe maternal hypertension (pre-eclampsia) with placental insufficiency can lead to fetal growth restriction and sometimes hydrops, but this is less common than other causes like chromosomal abnormalities.
