      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: A) HPE Explanation: HPE is the gold standard investigation for definitively diagnosing/confirming endometriosis. It shows blood-filled macrophages (hemosiderophages) in visualization. Investigations for Endometriosis: Ultrasonography (TVS and ERUS) (Option C) : Initial investigation, where endometrioma appears as ground glass opacities and hemorrhagic cysts appear as thread-like structures. Laparoscopy (Option B): Investigation of choice, with new lesions visualised as red flame-like and chronic lesions as powder-burnt appearance. Histopathology: Gold standard for confirming the diagnosis, showing blood-filled macrophages (hemosiderophages). MRI (Option D): This is not routinely done but is accurate for diagnosing deep-infiltrating endometriosis (DIE), such as Bowel, Thoracic, Bladder, and Rectovaginal endometriosis, and is done before laparoscopy. CA 125 Assay: Non-specific marker, often elevated in endometriosis. Laparotomy: Not done for confirmatory purposes due to its invasiveness and higher risk of complications.

      "question": "A 38-year-old multigravida presents with 2 years of infertility, dyspareunia and dysmenorrhea. She has a retroverted uterus and adnexal tenderness. What would be the initial investigation?",
      "options": {
        "A": "Laparotomy",
        "B": "Transvaginal USG",
        "C": "Colposcopy",
        "D": "Transabdominal pelvic USG"
      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Correct answer B - Transvaginal USG The given scenario with dyspareunia and dysmenorrhea points to endometriosis and also shows adnexal involvement , which needs a transvaginal ultrasound for detecting the precise anatomic details of adnexal structures. Ultrasound is the first line of investigation for pelvic pathology. It can be done by transabdominal (TAS) or transvaginal route (TVS). Adnexal tenderness requires precise anatomic details of adnexal structures, which is provided by the transvaginal ultrasound. A vaginal probe is an extension of bimanual palpation with better resolution of pelvic findings. Advantages of TVS over TAS: Full bladder not required Better details (superior resolution) Better images in obese women Investigation of choice: Laparoscopy Gold standard investigation: HPE Laparotomy (Option A) can help confirm the diagnosis made on ultrasound and determine if the origin of the lesion is in doubt. However, it is an invasive procedure and hence not preferred over ultrasound. Colposcopy (Option C) can help in identifying vaginal and cervical abnormalities. However, for adnexal pathology, transvaginal ultrasound is recommended. Transabdominal pelvic ultrasound (Option D) is the first line of investigation. However, the transvaginal route is preferred over the transabdominal route for the reasons given in the explanation. Reference: Williams Gynecology, 4th edition, Page: 220.",

      "question": "What is the most probable diagnosis for a 30-year-old woman who previously had dilatation and curettage, and now presents with amenorrhea, a negative urine pregnancy test, and a honeycomb appearance in the uterine cavity on HSG?",
      "options": {
        "A": "Asherman syndrome",
        "B": "Kallman syndrome",
        "C": "Sheehan syndrome",
        "D": "Stein-Leventhal syndrome"
      },
      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: A) Asherman syndrome Explanation: The patient presents with amenorrhea following a history of dilatation and curettage (D&C). A honeycomb appearance in the uterine cavity on hysterosalpingography (HSG) strongly suggests intrauterine adhesions, which is diagnostic of Asherman syndrome. This condition is characterized by the formation of scar tissue inside the uterine cavity, often due to uterine surgery, infection, or trauma. Incorrect Options: Kallman syndrome (Option B) is characterized by hypogonadotropic hypogonadism and anosmia (loss of smell). Since there is no mention of anosmia in the case history, Kallman syndrome is unlikely. Sheehan syndrome (Option C) typically follows severe postpartum hemorrhage, leading to i schemic damage to the anterior pituitary. This results in the inability to produce hormones, including those that regulate menstruation. However, there is no history of significant postpartum blood loss in this scenario. Stein-Leventhal syndrome (Option D), also known as polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS), is associated with hyperandrogenism, anovulation, and polycystic ovaries. The clinical features do not fit the description of PCOS, making this option incorrect. Reference: Williams Gyanecology, 4th Edition, Page: 374-375.",

      "question": "What is the probable diagnosis for a middle-aged woman who complains of dysmenorrhea, dyspareunia, and infertility, and exhibits a retroverted uterus that is fixed, tender, and accompanied by tender nodularity of the uterosacral ligaments?",
      "options": {
        "A": "PID",
        "B": "Endometriosis",
        "C": "Pelvic TB",
        "D": "Leiomyoma"
      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: B) Endometriosis Explanation: Endometriosis is the most probable diagnosis in this case. The patient's symptoms, including dysmenorrhea, dyspareunia, and infertility, are commonly associated with endometriosis. Additionally, the physical examination findings of a fixed, tender retroverted uterus and nodularity of the uterosacral ligaments are classic signs of endometriosis, as the endometrial-like tissue grows outside the uterus, often involving the ligaments, ovaries, and peritoneum. Pathology of Endometriosis: Complications Fertility-related Infertility Increased risk of ectopic pregnancy Pain-related Chronic pelvic pain Dysmenorrhea Dyspareunia Dyschezia Organ-specific Gastrointestinal: Bowel obstruction Rectal bleeding Ovarian: Endometriomas Ovarian torsion Rupture of chocolate cyst Urinary: Ureteral obstruction Hydronephrosis Structural Adhesions Frozen pelvis Incorrect Options: Pelvic Inflammatory Disease (PID) (Option A) is typically associated with a history of infection, fever, and abnormal vaginal discharge. The absence of infection or fever makes PID an unlikely diagnosis in this case. Pelvic tuberculosis (Option C) may present with pelvic pain, but it is usually non-tender on examination. The presence of nodularity and a retroverted uterus, along with the patient's specific symptoms, points more towards endometriosis. Leiomyomas (fibroids) (Option D) generally present with symptoms such as heavy menstrual bleeding, not with the characteristic symptoms of dysmenorrhea, dyspareunia, and infertility associated with endometriosis. Fibroids can cause pelvic pain, but the findings of a retroverted uterus with nodularity of the uterosacral ligaments are not typical for fibroids.",

      "question": "A 30-year-old woman presents with severe dysmenorrhoea, dyspareunia, infertility, and a diagnosis of endometriosis was made. The patient was posted for laparoscopy, and at surgery, dense pelvic adhesions were seen with the bowel stuck to the fundus. Ovaries were cystic and stuck to each other. What is the next step of management for this patient?",
      "options": {
        "A": "LUNA for chronic pelvic pain",
        "B": "Gestrinone to decrease the LH surge",
        "C": "Cystectomy and adhesiolysis",
        "D": "Hysterectomy and oophorectomy"
      },
      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: C) Cystectomy and adhesiolysis Explanation: Cystectomy and adhesiolysis are the most appropriate next steps in the management of this patient with endometriosis. Cystectomy involves the surgical removal of ovarian cysts, while adhesiolysis involves the surgical separation of pelvic adhesions. These procedures aim to alleviate symptoms, restore pelvic anatomy and function, and improve fertility outcomes in patients with endometriosis. LUNA for chronic pelvic pain (Option A): LUNA (Laparoscopic uterosacral nerve ablation) is a surgical procedure used to alleviate chronic pelvic pain by destroying the uterosacral nerves. However, it is not the first choice when dealing with ovarian cysts and dense pelvic adhesions associated with endometriosis. Gestrinone to decrease the LH surge (Option B): Gestrinone can be used to suppress the growth of endometrial tissue by decreasing the LH surge. However, in this case, where there are dense pelvic adhesions, ovarian cysts, and significant symptoms, pharmacological therapy alone would not be sufficient. Hysterectomy and oophorectomy (Option D) are considered radical surgical options, typically reserved for when conservative treatments have failed or for patients who no longer desire fertility. In this case, conservative management through cystectomy and adhesiolysis is preferred. Reference: Williams Gynaecology, 4th Edition, Page: 461,462.",
