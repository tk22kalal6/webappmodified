      "explanation": "Correct Answer: C) Polyhydramnios Explanation: Polyhydramnios: Excessive amniotic fluid, is not typically associated with post-dated pregnancies. It is commonly seen in maternal diabetes, fetal anomalies, or infections. Adverse Maternal and Perinatal Outcomes Associated with Post-term Pregnancy: Maternal Perinatal Fetal macrosomia: Is a common complication of post-dated pregnancies due to the extended period of fetal growth. Stillbirth Oligohydramnios: Reduced amniotic fluid, because the placenta becomes less efficient at maintaining amniotic fluid levels as it ages. Post-maturity syndrome Pre-eclampsia Meconium aspiration syndrome: The fetus is more likely to pass meconium into the amniotic fluid, which can be inhaled into the lungs during birth.

It is characterised by a large-for-gestational-age baby, dry and peeling skin, overgrown nails, meconium-stained amniotic fluid, and oligohydramnios. Amniotic fluid pockets measured <1 cm at 42 weeks. Intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR)(Option A): While this condition might be considered, the baby's large size and other specific characteristics (dry, peeling skin, overgrown nails) disqualify it as IUGR. Neonatal sepsis(Option C): Presents with signs of infection such as fever, lethargy, poor feeding, and respiratory distress. The described findings do not align with neonatal sepsis.

      "explanation": "Correct Answer : A) Small for gestational age Explanation : Post-dated pregnancy, which refers to a pregnancy that extends beyond 42 weeks, is associated with several complications. Small for gestational age is seen in cases of uteroplacental insufficiency. Oligohydramnios(Option B): Reduced amniotic fluid volume because the ageing placenta may become less efficient at supporting the baby, leading to decreased urine output from the fetus and thus reduced amniotic fluid. Placental Calcifications (Option C): It is also a common finding seen in post-dated pregnancy. Meconium-stained amniotic fluid (Option D) : As the fetus matures and stays longer in the womb, the baby is more likely to pass meconium (the first stool) into the amniotic fluid. Other findings: Length is about 54 cm. Ageing of placenta with excessive infarction.

      "correct_answer": "D",
      "explanation": "cesarean. Correct Answer: D) Administer antibiotics and prepare for immediate delivery, either vaginal or cesarean. Explanatio: Administer antibiotics and prepare for immediate delivery, either vaginal or cesarean. Chorioamnionitis in the PPROM setting requires urgent management to prevent serious complications. Prompt delivery, preferably vaginal, is crucial when chorioamnionitis is diagnosed. Antibiotics are essential in managing chorioamnionitis. Even without detectable bacteria, intra-amniotic inflammation is risky, especially with early preterm labour onset. In preterm pregnancies, bacteria in amniotic fluid often cause labour, unlike in term pregnancies, where it results from the labour process. Diagnosing chorioamnionitis is challenging; maternal leukocytosis is inconsistent, and fever ( ≥ 38°C or 100.4°F) is the most reliable indicator. Lower temperatures and other clinical risk factors can also suggest infection. Chorioamnionitis increases fetal and neonatal morbidity, leading to sepsis, respiratory distress, early-onset seizures, intraventricular haemorrhage, periventricular leukomalacia, and cerebral palsy. Administer antibiotics and observe for improvement before considering delivery: This is wrong since delaying delivery increases risks for both mother and fetus (Option A) Induce labour with oxytocin and administer antibiotics simultaneously: This is wrong since the patient is already in active labour, making induction unnecessary (Option B) Immediate cesarean section without administering antibiotics: Wrong since the cesarean should be reserved for when vaginal delivery is not feasible, and antibiotics are crucial to manage the infection (Option C) Reference: Williams obstetrics, 26th edition, pages 788, 789, 800, 801",

      "explanation": "Correct Answer: A) Betamethasone 12 mg IM, repeated after 24 hours Explanation: Betamethasone is a corticosteroid used to enhance fetal lung maturity in preterm labour. It is administered in two doses, 12 mg IM each, 24 hours apart , to stimulate fetal lung maturation and reduce the incidence of respiratory distress syndrome. Corticosteroid therapy used for fetal lung maturity in preterm labour Corticosteroid Dosage and Administration Mechanism of Action Betamethasone (Preferred choice) 12 mg IM, repeated after 24 hours (2 doses) Enhances fetal lung maturation by stimulating surfactant production Dexamethasone (Alternative) 6 mg IM, repeated every 12 hours (4 doses) Similar mechanism to betamethasone Reference: Williams Obstetrics, 4th Edition, Page 802",

      "question": "A 30-year-old woman, G2P1, at 32 weeks gestation, presents to the emergency department with complaints of regular uterine contractions every 10 minutes and lower back pain. She denies any leakage of fluid or vaginal bleeding. Upon examination, her cervix is found to be 3 cm dilated and 80% effaced. Fetal heart rate monitoring shows a reactive pattern. Which of the following complications is not anticipated in this patient with preterm labour?",

      "correct_answer": "D",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: D) Duodenal atresia Explanation: Regular uterine contractions and lower back pain are signs of labor. A gestational age 32 weeks points towards preterm labor; term labor would occur between 37 and 42 weeks. The cervix is described as being 3 cm dilated and 80% effaced at 32 weeks, indicating preterm labour. She denies leakage of fluid or vaginal bleeding, ruling out premature rupture of membranes or other complications that will be confused with labor Duodenal atresia is a congenital condition in which part of the duodenum is blocked or missing. While it can occur in newborns, it's not directly associated with preterm labour.

      "question": "A 28-year-old primi at 30 weeks gestation presents with complaints of lower abdominal pain and backache. She has no significant medical history. On examination, her cervix is closed, but there are mild irregular uterine contractions. The obstetrician plans to measure fetal fibronectin (fFN) to assess the risk of preterm labour.

        "A": "It is a glycoprotein at the interface of the chorion and the decidua.",

      "explanation": "Correct Answer: D) A negative test is highly predictive of delivery within the next 7 days. membranes to the uterus during implantation. Fetal Fibronectin (fFN): Origin Fetal fibronectin (fFN) is a glycoprotein produced by fetal cells. Found at the interface of the chorion and the decidua Mechanism Function in intercellular adhesion during implantation. Normally present in cervical and vaginal secretions in early pregnancy and again in late pregnancy, typically not found between 22 and 34 weeks. Disruption of this \"glue\" (due to inflammation, infection, or physical disruption) releases fFN into the cervicovaginal secretions. Uses Measurement of fFN levels in cervicovaginal secretions can help predict the risk of preterm birth. Recommended for symptomatic women between 24 and 34 weeks of gestation. Positive Result: Indicates a higher risk of preterm birth, but it is not definitive. Negative Result: Suggests a low risk of preterm birth within the next 7-14 days. Limitations Positive results do not guarantee preterm labour Recent sexual activity, vaginal examination, or the presence of lubricants or disinfectants can affect test accuracy.
