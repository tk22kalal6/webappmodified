      "correct_answer": "D",
      "explanation": "candidiasis. Correct answer: D) An increased vaginal pH can predispose to infections such as vulvovaginal candidiasis. Explanation: Vulvovaginal candidiasis (yeast infection) typically occurs in a physiological pH of vagina (acidic environment) and is not associated with an increased vaginal pH . The infections that typically occur in increased vaginal pH are Trichomoniasis and bacterial vaginosis . Normal physiological pH of vagina i.e. 3.8-5.0 (acidic) helps prevent the growth of pathogenic organisms (Option A) . Certain microorganisms thrive when vaginal pH is increased. Vaginal pH is maintained by the Doderlein’s bacillus which converts glycogen to lactic acid under the influence of estrogen (Option B) . Doderlein’s bacillus appears in the vagina 3–4 days after birth, disappears after 10–14 days, and reappears at puberty when estrogen levels rise. (Option C) Table: Vaginal pH, Symptoms, and Indications pH Symptoms Diseases 3.8 to 4.4 Normal Physiological pH - 3.8 to 4.4 Itching, burning, white thick curdy discharge Vulvovaginal candidiasis 4.5 and above Itching, fishy smell, thin homogeneous discharge (white to grayish) Bacterial vaginosis 5.5 and above Green or yellow, frothy discharge; foul odor; pain with sexual intercourse, vaginal soreness Trichomoniasis Reference: Pubmed DC Dutta Textbook of Gynaecology Pg. 5, Pg. 134-135",

        "D": "Male partner should be treated with topical antifungal cream"
      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Male partners are often asymptomatic carriers and should be treated with metronidazole or tinidazole to prevent reinfection of the female partner. Treatment schedule: Metronidazole 200 mg thrice daily orally for 1 week or a single dose of 2 g. Tinidazole single dose 2 g orally is equally effective. Same regimen for both partners. The male partner should use a condom during intercourse until the female partner's treatment is completed. Male partners should also be treated in cases of vaginal candidiasis where the partner is treated with topical nystatin. In case of bacterial vaginosis, treatment of male partner is not necessary. Option A Male partners can be asymptomatic carriers and can transmit the infection back to the female partner even after her treatment. Treating the male partner helps reduce the risk of reinfection. Option C: Screening identifies asymptomatic carriers, but treatment is essential to prevent transmission and recurrence of the infection between sexual partners. Option D: Topical antifungal creams are used to treat fungal infections like candidiasis, not protozoal infections like trichomoniasis. Reference: DC Dutta Gynaecology 8th Ed., Pg.135, 136.",

      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Vaginal mucosa is thin due to deficiency of estrogen and is more susceptible to infection and trauma leading to atrophic vaginitis. There may be desquamation of the vaginal epithelium which may lead to formation of adhesions and bands between the walls. Clinical Features: Yellowish or blood stained vaginal discharge Discomfort, dryness, soreness in the vulva Dyspareunia. On Examination: Evidences of pruritus vulvae. Vaginal examination is often painful and the walls are found inflamed. Diagnosis : Mainly clinical, however senile endometritis may coexist and carcinoma body or the cervix should be excluded prior to therapy. Treatment: Improvement of general health and treatment of infection if present should be done. Systemic estrogen therapy may be considered if there is no contraindication. This improves the vaginal epithelium, raises glycogen content, and lowers vaginal pH. Intravaginal application of estrogen cream by an applicator is also effective. About one-third of the vaginal estrogen is systemically absorbed. Reference: DC Dutta Gynaecology 8th Edition Pg 136-137",
