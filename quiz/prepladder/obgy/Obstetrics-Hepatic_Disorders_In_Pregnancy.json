      "correct_answer": "D",
      "explanation": "Correct answer: D) LCHAD (long-chain 3-hydroxy acyl-CoA dehydrogenase) gene mutation mutations are not associated with ICP. Instead, they are linked to a different condition called fatty acid oxidation disorders, which can lead to acute fatty liver disease during pregnancy (AFLP). Characteristic Acute Fatty Liver of Pregnancy (AFLP) Intrahepatic Cholestasis of Pregnancy (IHCP) Pathogenesis Defective fatty acid oxidation due to mitochondrial enzyme dysfunction (e.g., LCHAD mutation). Impaired bile acid secretion due to mutations in bile transport genes ABCB4 and ABCB11 gene (Option A & B) Bile salt export pump (BSEP) Multidrug resistance protein 3 (MDR3) (Option C) Onset Typically occurs in the third trimester Usually manifests in the second or third trimester . Symptoms Nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, fatigue, jaundice, hypoglycemia. Severe pruritus (especially on palms and soles), dark urine, pale stools, mild jaundice. Complications Acute liver failure, renal failure, encephalopathy, coagulopathy, maternal and fetal death. Preterm delivery, fetal distress, increased risk of stillbirth. Lab findings and diagnosis Elevated liver enzymes, hypoglycemia, coagulopathy, elevated ammonia levels Diagnosis confirmed by liver biopsy if necessary. Elevated serum bile acids, and mildly elevated liver enzymes. Elevated serum bile acids >10 µmol/L; exclusion of other liver diseases is the mainstay of diagnosis Treatment Immediate delivery and supportive care with management of complications. Ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA) to reduce bile acids and early delivery if needed. Prognosis High maternal and fetal mortality without prompt treatment. Good prognosis with proper management, though there is a risk of recurrence in subsequent pregnancies.",

      "explanation": "Correct answer: B) Acute Fatty Liver of Pregnancy (AFLP) Explanation: The clinical presentation and lab findings are most consistent with Acute Fatty Liver of Pregnancy (AFLP), which is a rare but serious complication occurring typically in the third trimester. Acute fatty liver of pregnancy (AFLP): Definition A rare, life-threatening liver disorder that occurs in the third trimester of pregnancy, characterised by microvesicular fatty infiltration of hepatocytes. Risk Factors First pregnancy Multiple gestations Male fetus Pre-eclampsia Maternal obesity Prior history of AFLP Clinical Features Nausea and vomiting Right upper quadrant pain Jaundice Malaise and fatigue Anorexia Polydipsia and polyuria Ascites (rare) Complications Liver failure Renal failure Coagulopathy Hypoglycemia Encephalopathy Management Immediate delivery of the baby (definitive treatment) Supportive care for the mother: IV fluids, glucose infusion, and blood products for coagulopathy. Intrahepatic Cholestasis of Pregnancy (ICP) (Option A): ICP typically presents with pruritus, particularly affecting the palms and soles. Jaundice may occur but is not a dominant feature. Liver enzyme elevation is usually mild ( ≤ 10 µmol/L). HELLP Syndrome (Option C): HELLP syndrome is associated with hemolysis, elevated liver enzymes, and low platelet count. It presents with right upper quadrant pain, nausea, and vomiting, but hypoglycemia and significant renal dysfunction are not as pronounced as in AFLP. Viral Hepatitis (Option D): Viral hepatitis can cause elevated liver enzymes and jaundice, but it is less likely to present with hypoglycemia and coagulopathy and normal-sized liver on physical examination.

        "D": "Platelet counts lower than 200,000/"
      },
      "correct_answer": "D",
      "explanation": "µ L Correct answer: D) Platelet counts lower than 200,000/ µ L Explanation: The clinical vignette suggests HELLP syndrome (Haemolysis with Elevated Liver enzymes and Low Platelet levels), a severe form of preeclampsia. The platelet count criterion for HELLP syndrome is typically lower than 100,000/ µ L , which indicates significant thrombocytopenia, a critical component of diagnosis. Criteria for Diagnosis of HELLP Syndrome: Tenesse Classification Haemolysis Abnormal peripheral blood smear Elevated lactate dehydrogenase (LDH > 600 IU/L) Elevated bilirubin ( ≥ 1.2 mg/dL) Decreased serum haptoglobin Elevated Liver Enzymes Elevated (AST & ALT > 70 IU/L) Low Platelet Count Platelets < 100,000/ µ L Another criterion namely the Mississippi Triple Class System further classifies HELLP Syndrome based on the platelet counts. Mississippi Triple Class System Class I (severe) AST & ALT > 70 IU/L LDH > 600 IU/L Platelets <50 x 10 9 /L Class II (moderate) AST & ALT > 70 IU/L LDH > 600 IU/L Platelets 50-100 x 10 9 /L Class III (mild) AST & ALT > 40 IU/L LDH > 600 IU/L Platelets 100-150 x 10 9 /L HELLP syndrome is believed to be related to abnormal placentation and endothelial dysfunction, leading to systemic inflammation and activation of the coagulation system, causing systemic symptoms.

      "options": {
        "A": "Immediate delivery if gestational age is 34 weeks or more",
        "B": "Antihypertensive therapy to target blood pressure of 110/70 mm Hg",
        "C": "Corticosteroids to promote fetal lung maturity if the pregnancy is <34 weeks",
        "D": "Magnesium sulfate for seizure prophylaxis"
      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Over-aggressive lowering of blood pressure can c ompromise uteroplacental perfusion, potentially leading to fetal distress. Medications like labetalol or hydralazine are commonly used to maintain safe maternal blood pressure without compromising fetal oxygenation. Management of HELLP syndrome: Pregnancy 34 weeks: Prophylactic MgSO 4 and immediate delivery. Pregnancy 24-34 weeks: MgSO 4 , corticosteroids (Betamethasone 12 mg i.m, 2 doses, 24 hours apart), and deliver. Antihypertensive therapy. Epidural anaesthesia can be used safely if the platelet count is >1,00,000/mm 3 . Platelet transfusion if count <50,000/mm 3 . Cesarean section is the most common mode of delivery. Normal delivery can be attempted if: The cervix is ripe. Gestational age >32 weeks. FHR is reactive. Immediate delivery if gestational age is 34 weeks or more (Option A): In cases of HELLP syndrome, immediate delivery is indicated if the gestation is ≥ 34 weeks. This is the definitive treatment to prevent further complications for both the mother and fetus. Delaying delivery in such cases may increase the risk of severe maternal and fetal outcomes, making this management approach essential. Corticosteroids to promote fetal lung maturity if the pregnancy is <34 weeks (Option C): If gestational age is between 24-34 weeks, corticosteroids are administered to enhance fetal lung maturity. This intervention reduces the risk of neonatal complications such as respiratory distress syndrome if premature delivery becomes necessary. Magnesium sulfate for seizure prophylaxis (Option D): Magnesium sulfate is the treatment for seizure prevention in HELLP syndrome. It is effective in reducing the risk of eclampsia. It is also given to patients undergoing labour or delivery to prevent further neurological complications.

      "correct_answer": "D",
      "explanation": "leading to high maternal and fetal mortality rates. The clinical presentation of jaundice, elevated liver enzymes, elevated bilirubin levels and hepatomegaly fits well with hepatitis E. Hepatitis E: Definition Hepatitis E is caused by the hepatitis E virus (HEV), which is primarily transmitted through the fecal-oral route, often through contaminated water. It can cause acute liver inflammation. Aetiology The hepatitis E virus (RNA virus) Genotypes 1 & 2 cause outbreaks in developing countries. Genotypes 3 & 4 in developed countries. Pathogenesis HEV enters the body through the gastrointestinal tract, replicates in the liver, and is shed in bile and faeces. In pregnancy, particularly in the third trimester, the virus can lead to severe liver disease and fulminant hepatitis. Clinical Features Jaundice Fatigue Nausea and vomiting Anorexia Abdominal pain Fever Dark urine and pale stools Diagnosis Markedly elevated liver enzymes (ALT, AST) Elevated bilirubin ( around 6-15 mg/dL) Serology: Anti-HEV IgM (acute infection) and Anti-HEV IgG (past infection) HEV RNA detection in blood or stool by PCR Complications Mother Fulminant hepatitis Acute liver failure Increased mortality (especially in the third trimester) Fetus Preterm birth Low birth weight IUD Management No specific antiviral treatment is approved for HEV Supportive care: Hydration, rest, and nutritional support Hospitalisation for severe cases Prognosis Poorer prognosis in pregnant women, particularly in the third trimester, with higher maternal and fetal mortality Hepatitis A (Option A): Hepatitis A is an acute viral infection that can cause jaundice and elevated liver enzymes. The presence of severe complications in pregnancy and the broader clinical context suggest considering hepatitis E Hepatitis B (Option B): Hepatitis B can cause both acute and chronic liver disease and is associated with elevated liver enzymes and jaundice. However, the presence of severe complications in pregnancy and the broader clinical context suggest considering hepatitis E Hepatitis C (Option C): Hepatitis C typically causes a chronic infection and is less likely to present with acute severe symptoms like those described. Acute hepatitis C is also relatively uncommon compared to hepatitis E in pregnancy. Reference: DC Dutta's Textbook of Obstetrics, 9th Edition, Page 271,272.
