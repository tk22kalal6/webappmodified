      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: A) Metronidazole Explanation: In this patient, bacterial vaginosis is confirmed by: Presence of clue cells on microscopy Positive Whiff test Clue cells are epithelial cells embedded with rod-shaped bacteria The antibiotic of choice is Metronidazole, a nitroimidazole antimicrobial Diagnosis Methods and Treatment for Bacterial Vaginosis Diagnostic Methods Amsel's Criteria Presence of clue cells (more than 20% of the total cell population) Positive whiff test Vaginal pH greater than 4.5 Thin, white, homogeneous vaginal discharge Microscopic Examination Detection of clue cells in vaginal smear Molecular Methods Detection of ribosomal RNA of Gardnerella vaginalis using PCR Treatment: First-Line Treatment Oral Metronidazole: 500 mg BD for 7 days Tinidazole 2 g orally for 3 days Alternative Treatment Clindamycin 300 mg orally BD for 7 days Nystatin pessary (Option B) : Nystatin pessary is used to treat vaginal candidiasis, characterized by thick, white, cottage cheese-like discharge without malodor. The presence of clue cells and positive Whiff test rules out candidiasis. Tetracycline (Option C) : Tetracycline is not the first-line treatment for BV due to its broad spectrum and potential to further disrupt vaginal flora. It is more commonly used for conditions like chlamydia. Azithromycin (Option D) : This macrolide antibiotic is primarily used to treat cervicitis caused by Chlamydia trachomatis and does not effectively target the anaerobic bacteria involved in BV.

      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: B) Curdy white discharge Explanation: Curdy white discharge is a hallmark of vaginal candidiasis (yeast infection), which is caused by an overgrowth of Candida species. The discharge appears thick and white, often resembling cottage cheese. However, the condition described in this case is Trichomoniasis, which is caused by the protozoan Trichomonas vaginalis. Trichomoniasis typically results in a frothy, yellow-green discharge that may be foul-smelling, not a curdy white discharge. Trichomonas Vaginitis Trichomonas vaginitis, caused by the protozoan Trichomonas vaginalis, is the most common cause of vaginitis in women of reproductive age, typically transmitted sexually. Symptoms: Yellowish-Green, Frothy Discharge: Foul-smelling. Vulvar Irritation & Itching : Around the vaginal opening. (Option D ruled out) Painful Urination (Dysuria): Burning sensation during micturition (Option C ruled out) Dyspareunia: Pain during intercourse. \"Strawberry Cervix\": Punctate hemorrhages on the cervix. (Option A ruled out) Recurrent Infections. Organism: Trichomonas vaginalis is a flagellated protozoan. It thrives in the vaginal and cervical mucosa, causing inflammation.

      "explanation": "Correct Answer: D) Per vagina examination Explanation: The first step in investigating smelly greenish vaginal discharge postpartum is a per vagina examination . This helps assess the discharge, identify signs of infection or inflammation, and collect samples for analysis, such as a vaginal swab, to determine the cause and guide management Trichomonas Vaginitis Trichomonas vaginitis, caused by the protozoan Trichomonas vaginalis, is the most common cause of vaginitis in women of reproductive age, typically transmitted sexually. Symptoms: Yellowish-Green, Frothy Discharge: Foul-smelling. Vulvar Irritation & Itching: Around the vaginal opening. Painful Urination (Dysuria).

However, it is not the first step in investigating postpartum vaginal discharge, though it may be ordered later if an infection is suspected or confirmed to evaluate the severity. USG (Option B) may be used if the per vagina examination suggests complications like retained placental tissue or uterine infection, but it is not the initial investigation for vaginal discharge. Urine analysis (Option C) is not relevant in this case, as the symptoms are focused on vaginal discharge. A urine test would be more appropriate if urinary tract infection (UTI) symptoms were present. Reference: Williams Gynaecology, 4th Edition, Page: 64-66.",

        "B": "Uterine cancer",
        "C": "Pelvic organ prolapse",
        "D": "Cervical cancer"
      },
      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: A) Infertility Explanation: The patient likely has pelvic inflammatory disease (PID) due to a previous chlamydia infection, and untreated or recurrent PID can cause scarring and damage to the reproductive organs, particularly the fallopian tubes. This scarring can lead to infertility or an increased risk of ectopic pregnancy. PID is a major cause of infertility in women, especially if left untreated. Pelvic inflammatory disease Pathogenesis Infection ascends from the cervix and endometrium to the fallopian tubes and ovaries, causing inflammation and scarring. Can lead to infertility, ectopic pregnancy, and chronic pelvic pain. Aetiology Acute: Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Chlamydia trachomatis, E. coli, Mycoplasma genitalium, Anaerobes (Bacteroides species), Gardnerella vaginalis, Trichomonas vaginalis, Streptococci, Mycobacterium tuberculosis, Actinomyces israelii. Chronic: Same as acute, with possible additional mixed infections. Clinical Features Signs: Fever, Purulent cervical discharge, Cervical motion tenderness, Adnexal tenderness, Abdominal tenderness. Symptoms: Lower abdominal pain, Abnormal vaginal discharge, Dyspareunia (pain during intercourse), Dysuria (pain during urination), Menstrual irregularities, Nausea and vomiting. Complications Infertility: Due to scarring and damage to fallopian tubes. Ectopic Pregnancy Chronic Pelvic Pain Peritonitis Sepsis Laboratory Findings Elevated WBC, Elevated CRP, Elevated ESR. Ultrasound: Thickened, fluid-filled fallopian tubes and free pelvic fluid. Next Step in Diagnosis Endocervical Swab: Detects key pathogens like Chlamydia trachomatis and Neisseria gonorrhoeae to guide treatment and prevent complications. Treatment First-line Therapy: Ceftriaxone 250 mg IM single dose, or Cefoxitin 2g IM single dose + Probenecid 1g PO single dose, or Cefotaxime IV. Add Doxycycline 100 mg PO BD for 14 days, with or without Metronidazole 500 mg PO BD for 14 days. Male Partner Treatment Treat with Cefixime + Azithromycin (Grey kit in India) to prevent reinfection. Out-patient Therapy (India) Yellow kit: Ceftriaxone, Doxycycline, Metronidazole for syndromic management. Uterine cancer (Option B): It arises from the lining of the uterus and is influenced by factors like hormonal imbalances and genetics. Chlamydia infection or PID is not a known cause of uterine cancer. Pelvic organ prolapse (Option C): Although chronic infections can contribute to pelvic floor weakness, pelvic organ prolapse is not a direct long-term consequence of chlamydia or PID. Cervical cancer (Option D): While chlamydia infection can increase the risk of acquiring other sexually transmitted infections (such as HPV), which is a known risk factor for cervical cancer, chlamydia itself is not a direct cause of cervical cancer.

      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: B) Thick white discharge Explanation: Thick white discharge is not a characteristic feature of bacterial vaginosis (BV). The discharge associated with BV is typically thin, grayish-white, and homogenous, rather than thick. Pathophysiology of BV: BV occurs due to a reduction in lactobacilli (normal vaginal flora) and overgrowth of anaerobic bacteria such as Gardnerella vaginalis, Prevotella, Mobiluncus, and Bacteroides. Symptoms: Thin, foul-smelling vaginal discharge. Diagnosis: Based on Amsel criteria (at least 3 of 4 present) Amsel's Criteria for Bacterial Vaginosis (BV) Thin, gray-white discharge Homogeneous vaginal discharge, often malodorous. pH > 4.5 Vaginal pH greater than 4.5 is indicative. Positive Whiff Test Fishy odor when 10% KOH is added to the discharge. Clue cells on microscopy Vaginal epithelial cells coated with bacteria, giving a stippled appearance. Feature BV Normal Colposcopic findings (A, B) Homogeneous, milk-like secretions observed. Homogeneous, clear secretions seen. Microscopic findings (C, D) Gardnerella-like microbes and presence of clue cells on microscopy. Lactobacillus-like microbes observed with no clue cells. Microbial composition Overgrowth of anaerobes (e.g., Gardnerella vaginalis). Dominance of Lactobacillus species, maintaining vaginal acidity. Clinical significance Associated with fishy odor and elevated vaginal pH (>4.5), characteristic of BV. Represents a healthy vaginal microbiome with stable pH ( â‰¤ 4.5) and protective lactobacilli.

        "D": "Bilateral cornual block"
      },
      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: A) Bilateral hydrosalpinx Explanation: The given image is a hysterosalpingogram in which B/L fallopian tubes are blocked. Bilateral hydrosalpinx refers to the presence of fluid-filled dilatation or blockage of both fallopian tubes. This finding is characterized by the contrast agent filling the fallopian tubes and appearing as fluid-filled sacs on the HSG images . Bilateral hydrosalpinx can be a result of various conditions, such as infection, scarring, or previous pelvic surgery. Bilateral hydrosalpinx: Fallopian tube neoplasms are uncommon, with most fallopian tube masses being related to ectopic pregnancy or the aftermath of pelvic inflammatory disease (PID). One of these conditions, hydrosalpinx, is a chronic cystic enlargement of the fallopian tube that results from distal tubal obstruction. On sonographic examination, hydrosalpinx appears as a thin-walled, cystic, fusiform structure with incomplete septa and anechoic content. In certain cases, multiple small hyperechoic nodules (2 to 3 mm) may form around the inner circumference of the tube, creating a \" beads on a string \" appearance. These nodules represent fibrotic endosalpingial folds. Hysterosalpingography, often performed for fertility evaluation, reveals ballooned, clubbed fallopian tubes filled with contrast. Management of hydrosalpinx depends on the certainty of the diagnosis, the woman's desire for future fertility, and the severity of symptoms. For asymptomatic women who have completed childbearing and whose sonographic findings support hydrosalpinx, expectant management is typically recommended. However, if pelvic pain or infertility is present, or if the diagnosis is uncertain, diagnostic laparoscopy is often performed. Extravasation into the venous system (Option B) would indicate that the contrast agent has leaked into the veins rather than following the normal flow through the fallopian tubes. This is an abnormal finding and typically not observed during a normal HSG. Normal HSG (Option C) refers to a hysterosalpingogram with no abnormal findings. In a normal HSG, the contrast agent should",

      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: A) Trichomonas vaginalis Explanation: Trichomonas vaginalis is a protozoan parasite that causes trichomoniasis, a sexually transmitted infection. It is known to cause symptoms such as foul-smelling frothy vaginal discharge and intense itching. The cervix and vagina may appear reddened and have a characteristic appearance described as a \"strawberry cervix\" or \"strawberry vagina\" due to small red or punctate lesions on its surface. Incorrect Options: Gardnerella vaginalis (Option B) is a bacterium associated with bacterial vaginosis (BV), which is a common vaginal infection. BV typically presents with a creamy-white discharge with a fishy odor. However, it does not cause the characteristic \"strawberry cervix\" or \"strawberry vagina\" appearance seen in the given scenario. Neisseria gonorrhoeae (Option C) is the bacterium responsible for the sexually transmitted infection, gonorrhea. While it can cause vaginal discharge and itching, it does not typically produce the \"strawberry cervix\" appearance described in the question. Candida albicans (Option D) is a fungus responsible for vaginal yeast infections, also known as candidiasis. The typical symptoms include thick, white, curd-like discharge and itching. However, it does not cause the \"strawberry cervix\" or \"strawberry vagina\" appearance. Reference: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK534826/ https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6758837/",

        "A": "Tuberculosis with tubo-ovarian mass",
        "B": "Ovarian malignancy",
        "C": "Ectopic pregnancy",
        "D": "Submucous fibroid"
      },
      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: A) Tuberculosis with tuboâ€“ovarian mass Explanation: The patient's presentation of low-grade fever, weight loss, abdominal pain, amenorrhea, pelvic mass, and ascites is highly suggestive of genital tuberculosis. Genital tuberculosis is a common extrapulmonary manifestation of tuberculosis, and it often involves the female genital tract, leading to tubo-ovarian masses, fallopian tube adhesions, and ascites. These clinical features are consistent with the diagnosis of tuberculosis with tubo-ovarian mass. Incorrect Options: While ovarian malignancy (Option B) can present with similar symptoms such as pelvic mass, weight loss, and abdominal pain, the presence of low-grade fever and signs of ascites makes tuberculosis a more likely diagnosis in this case. Ovarian malignancies typically do not cause systemic symptoms like fever, and ascites in ovarian cancer are usually associated with advanced disease. Ectopic pregnancy (Option C) refers to the implantation of a fertilized egg outside the uterine cavity, usually in the fallopian tube. While ectopic pregnancy can cause abdominal pain, amenorrhea, and pelvic mass, it is not typically associated with low-grade fever and ascites. Therefore, it is less likely to be the correct diagnosis in this case. Submucous fibroids (Option D) are benign growths that develop in the uterine wall. They can cause symptoms such as abnormal uterine bleeding, pelvic pain, and pressure symptoms, but they are not typically associated with systemic symptoms like low-grade fever, weight loss, and ascites. Hence, submucous fibroid is an unlikely diagnosis in this case .

        "D": "Treponema pallidum"
      },
      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: A) Calymmatobacterium Granulomatis Explanation: Granuloma inguinale, also known as donovanosis, is an infection caused by the gram-negative bacterium Klebsiella granulomatis or Calymmatobacterium granulomatis (Option A) . The incubation period can range from several days to weeks. The infection typically presents with painless inflammatory nodules that evolve into highly vascular, nontender ulcers. These ulcers eventually heal through fibrosis, which can lead to scar formation similar to keloids. Lymphadenopathy is generally absent. Diagnosis is primarily based on identifying Donovan bodies, which appear as \"closed safety pins\" when examined microscopically after Wright-Giemsa staining. Treatment of granuloma inguinale is azithromycin 1 g once a week for at least three weeks or until the lesions are fully healed. Other treatment options include doxycycline, ciprofloxacin, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, or erythromycin base. Improvement is typically seen within the first few days of treatment, though complete resolution may take time, and relapses have been reported. Incorrect Options: Chlamydia trachomatis (Option B) is a bacterium that causes various sexually transmitted infections, including chlamydia. However, it is not the causative agent for granuloma inguinale. Chlamydial infections typically present with symptoms such as urethritis, cervicitis, and pelvic inflammatory disease. Ureaplasma urealyticum (Option C) is a bacterium that belongs to the family Mycoplasmataceae and can be associated with certain genital infections. However, it is not the causative agent for granuloma inguinale. Ureaplasma infections are more commonly linked to conditions such as urethritis, bacterial vaginosis, and infertility. Treponema pallidum (OptionD) is the bacterium responsible for syphilis, a sexually transmitted infection. While syphilis can cause genital ulcers similar to those seen in granuloma inguinale, the causative agent for granuloma inguinale is specifically Calymmatobacterium granulomatis, not Treponema pallidum.

      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: A) Human Papilloma Virus Explanation: Human papillomavirus (HPV) is the causative organism of vulval warts. Vulval warts, also known as genital warts or condylomata acuminata, are sexually transmitted infection caused by certain types of HPV. HPV is a group of more than 100 related viruses, and the specific types responsible for genital warts are usually HPV types 6 and 11. Incorrect Options: Herpes simplex virus (HSV) (Option B) is not the causative organism of vulval warts. While HSV is another sexually transmitted infection, it is responsible for causing genital herpes, which presents with clinical features such as painful ulcers or blisters rather than warts. Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) (Option C) is the virus that causes AIDS (Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome). HIV is not directly associated with the development of vulval warts. However, individuals with HIV infection or other conditions that compromise the immune system may have a higher risk of developing persistent or more extensive warts. Cytomegalovirus (Option D) is a common virus that can cause various manifestations, particularly in individuals with weakened immune systems. However, it is not the causative organism of vulval warts. CMV is more commonly associated with infections such as congenital CMV infection, viral pneumonia, or hepatitis.",

      "correct_answer": "D",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: D) Physiological Explanation: The cause of her vaginal discharge is likely physiological , as increased discharge around ovulation occurs approximately 13 days after her last menstrual period. Leucorrhoea/Physiological vaginal discharge: Refers to an increase in normal vaginal discharge, which can vary in consistency and volume depending on the menstrual cycle. It can occur physiologically in the following conditions: Puberty Ovulation (where the discharge may become more copious and clear, resembling egg white consistency) Pregnancy Pre-menstrual phase (occasionally) The discharge may originate from the cervix or vagina, and a speculum examination can distinguish between the two. If the discharge is cervical, excessive mucoid secretion will be visible at the external os. Normal vaginal discharge is typically clear or white, odourless, non-itchy, and has a pH of 3.8-4.2. This type of discharge is not associated with pathology or infection. Candidiasis (Option A) is a fungal infection caused by Candida species, typically present with itching, thick white discharge resembling cottage cheese, and vulvar redness or swelling, which is not described here. Bacterial vaginosis (Option B) is caused by an overgrowth of anaerobic bacteria in the vagina, diagnosed using Amsel's criteria, which require at least three of the following five criteria: Clue cells (epithelial cells with adherent bacteria) present in >20% on microscopic examination. Vaginal pH greater than 4.5. Positive whiff test with potassium hydroxide (fishy odour). Thin, white, homogeneous vaginal discharge. Fishy odour. Trichomoniasis (Option C) is a sexually transmitted infection caused by the parasite Trichomonas vaginalis. It typically presents with symptoms such as itching, a frothy yellow-green discharge, and a vaginal odour, none of which are described in this scenario.

Molecular Tests: PCR (high sensitivity, high false positives), Gene Xpert (promising for extrapulmonary TB). Laparoscopy (Gold Standard) : Reveals caseous nodules, tubercles, adhesions, shaggy areas, straw-colored fluid. Key Signs: Sharmaâ€™s Python Sign: Alternating constriction and dilatation of fallopian tubes. Sharmaâ€™s Kissing Fallopian Tubes Sign: Fusion and blockage due to caseous material and adhesions. Image showing kissing fallopian tube sign. Nodules are also seen Normal Fallopian Tube (Option B) : The fallopian tube normally appears thin-walled, mobile, and patent with a uniform lumen. No tubal distortion, adhesions, or nodules are seen in normal tubes. Hydrosalpinx (Option C) : It refers to fluid-filled, dilated fallopian tubes due to chronic infection or tubal blockage . The tube appears distended, with a thin wall and no internal nodules. In contrast, genital TB causes thickened walls with caseous nodules and adhesions, as seen in the given image. Endometriosis (Option D) : It leads to chocolate cysts (ovarian endometrioma), dense adhesions, and powder-burn lesions on the peritoneum, uterus, and ovaries. Unlike TB, it does not show caseous nodules or tubal beading. Image showing kissing ovaries sign (sonographic sign of moderate to severe endometriosis)",

      "explanation": "Correct Answer: B) Congenital syphilis Explanation: Kassowitz rule pertains to congenital syphilis and describes the impact of untreated syphilis in successive pregnancies. Kassowitz Rule: The rule states that if a woman with untreated syphilis has multiple pregnancies, the risk of fetal infection decreases with each subsequent pregnancy. In the first pregnancy, the outcome is usually an abortion. In subsequent pregnancies, the outcomes may involve stillbirths, and eventually, later pregnancies can result in live births with congenital syphilis. Congenital Syphilis: Congenital syphilis occurs when Treponema pallidum is transmitted from an infected mother to the fetus, leading to complications like fetal death, preterm labor, and stillbirth if untreated.

      "explanation": "Correct Answer: C) Condyloma accuminata Explanation: The image shown indicates Condylomata acuminata. Condylomata Acuminata (Anogenital Warts): Caused by Human Papillomavirus (HPV), primarily strains 6 and 11. Mainly transmitted through sexual contact. Risk Factors: Age, lifestyle, and sexual practices influence susceptibility. Diagnosed clinically, but histopathological examination reveals acanthosis, hyperkeratosis, and koilocytes (large keratinocytes with pyknotic nuclei). Clinical Features: Usually asymptomatic, though they may cause bleeding, pruritus, and pain. Typically appear as raised, skin-colored, fleshy papules. Size ranges from one to five millimeters in diameter. Can be broad and flat, pedunculated (on a stalk) , or occasionally have a cauliflower-like appearance. Lesions are commonly found in multiples and may coalesce. Present in the anogenital region or, less frequently, the oral cavity. Management: Treatment is typically not required for lesions that resolve spontaneously. Persistent or symptomatic lesions: Topical therapies (e.g., podophyllotoxin, imiquimod), cryotherapy, TCA application, or surgical excision. Surgical methods like electrosurgery and laser therapy are effective for refractory cases. Condyloma lata (Option A) is associated with secondary syphilis and typically presents as flat, broad, wart-like lesions. These lesions are painless and have a moist appearance, often occurring in the genital area. Molluscum contagiosum (Option B) is caused by the molluscum contagiosum virus and results in small, dome-shaped papules or nodules with a central depression. These lesions are typically painless and can be found on various areas of the body. None of the Above (Option D): This option is not correct in this context because the image does indeed resemble a specific skin condition, and that condition is Condyloma acuminata, not â€˜None of the Aboveâ€™.",

      },
      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: A) VDRL Explanation: History of multiple sexual partners suggests a possibility of sexually transmitted disease, and the most common cause of painless genital ulcer is syphilis. The test for syphilis is the Venereal Disease Research Laboratory (VDRL) test. Syphilis is caused by a spirochete called Treponema pallidum. Painless genital ulcers can be caused by several STIs, including syphilis (M/c), donovanosis, and lymphogranuloma venereum (LGV). Investigations for syphilis: Serological tests: Nontreponemal and treponemal-specific tests Non-treponemal tests Treponemal-specific tests VDRL test RPR (Rapid Plasma Reagin test) FTA-ABS TP-PA Both these tests measure IgM and IgG antibodies against cardiolipin. False positives: Recent vaccination Febrile illness Pregnancy IV drug abusers SLE Ageing Cancer They remain positive for life after the infection. While NAT (Option B) can be used to detect various STIs, such as HIV, hepatitis B, and hepatitis C, it is not typically the first-line diagnostic test for syphilis. VDRL is more commonly used for screening and initial diagnosis of syphilis. Vaginal swab and culture (Option C) can be used for fungal and bacterial infections with vaginal discharge. This option may be appropriate for diagnosing other genital infections, such as bacterial vaginosis or candidiasis, but it is not the most suitable test for diagnosing syphilis. The polymerase chain reaction (PCR) (Option D) is a technique for amplifying many copies of a specific DNA sequence. It is used in many bacterial and viral infections, including syphilis. However, it is not the first line of investigation. Reference: Williams Gynaecology, 4th edition, Page: 60, 61, 62.",

All pregnant mothers are screened at the beginning of the pregnancy, and if found positive, the newborns are given hepatitis B immunoglobulin with a hepatitis B recombinant vaccine series. In HSV (Option B) , Fetal infection can occur by shedding of virus from the lower genital tract during vaginal delivery or rupture of membranes. Neonatal infection, when symptomatic, can present with chorioretinitis, mental retardation, microcephaly, seizures, and occasionally death. CMV (Option D) is a DNA virus transmitted by sexual, respiratory droplets and transplacental route . Infection can affect the fetus throughout gestation and cause microcephaly, intracranial calcification, chorioretinitis, mental retardation, nonimmune hydrops, stillbirth, IUGR, hepatosplenomegaly, thrombocytopenia, and sensorineural deafness.
