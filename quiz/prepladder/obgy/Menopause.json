      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: A) Central precocious puberty Explanation: Central precocious puberty is characterized by the early activation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal (HPG) axis, leading to elevated gonadotropin levels (LH and FSH). Peripheral precocious puberty is due to the production of sex hormones from sources outside the HPG axis, such as the adrenal glands or gonads, without elevated gonadotropin levels (Option B). Premature thelarche refers to isolated early breast development without other signs of puberty before the age of 8 and is typically not associated with elevated gonadotropins (Option C). Premature adrenarche is characterized by early pubic or axillary hair growth due to early adrenal androgen production. It is not typically associated with elevated gonadotropins (Option D).

      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: B) Heterosexual precocious puberty Explanation: Heterosexual precocious puberty is characterized by the development of secondary sexual characteristics opposite to the child's gender, such as facial hair, deepening of the voice, and increased muscle mass in a girl. Elevated androgen levels with male-pattern characteristics support this diagnosis. Isosexual/true/complete precocious puberty (Option A) is characterized by early development of secondary sexual characteristics that are appropriate for the child's gender, such as breast development in girls and testicular enlargement in boys. Common causes include: Constitutional – most common Primary hypothyroidism CNS lesions (30%) – trauma, infection (tuberculosis, encephalitis), and some degenerative, neoplastic or congenital defects. Incomplete precocious puberty (Option C) involves partial development of secondary sexual characteristics without complete progression of puberty. Premature adrenarche (Option D) involves the early appearance of pubic or axillary hair due to increased adrenal androgen production. Still, it does not typically include the extensive androgenic changes described, such as deepening of the voice and increased muscle mass. Reference: Williams Gynecology, 4th Edition, Pg 329, 330",

        "D": "Serum estradiol levels"
      },
      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: C) GnRH stimulation test Explanation: The GnRH stimulation test is used to differentiate between central and peripheral causes. 100 µg of GnRH is administered (SC), and the serum level of LH is measured. A Value Of LH >15 mIU/mL suggests gonadotropin-dependent (central) precocious puberty. In Central Precocious Puberty, GnRH stimulation significantly increases LH and FSH levels, resulting in elevated estrogen levels. In Peripheral Precocious Puberty, these levels will not increase significantly because of negative feedback by the exogenously produced estrogen. Basic investigations in precocious puberty: Serum hCG, FSH, LH, and prolactin (A baseline prepubertal LH level of greater than 0.3 IU/L is suggestive of Central Precocious Puberty). Thyroid profile (TSH, T4). Serum estradiol, testosterone, 17-OH progesterone, DHEA. USG, CT, or MRI of the abdomen and pelvis to rule out pathology of ovaries, adrenals, or uterus. Skull X-ray, CT scan, or MRI brain—to exclude intracranial lesions (hypothalamic hamartoma). Electroencephalogram (EEG): Abnormal EEG is often associated with CNS disease. X-ray hand and wrist (nondominant) for bone age. GnRH stimulation test Bone age assessment (Option A): In cases of precocious puberty, bone age is usually advanced beyond the child's chronological age, indicating early hormonal influence on bone growth. However, it does not differentiate between central and peripheral precocious puberty. Pelvic ultrasound (Option B): It can identify ovarian cysts or tumours that might be responsible for peripheral precocious puberty, but it only rules out ovarian pathologies. Serum estradiol levels (Option D) : It does not differentiate between central and peripheral causes of precocious puberty.

      "explanation": "and adrenarche. Correct Answer: D) The sequence of events in puberty starting from early is thelarche, menarche, and adrenarche. Explanation: The correct sequence of events in female puberty is typically thelarche (breast development), followed by adrenarche (development of pubic and axillary hair), and lastly, menarche (onset of menstruation) . Obesity is associated with an earlier onset of puberty due to increased estrogen production from adipose tissue (Option A) . Estrogen plays a crucial role in the development of secondary sexual characteristics and the growth of the uterus (Option B) . The uterine body-to-cervix ratio does change from approximately 1:2 at birth to 1:1 at menarche due to hormonal influences during puberty. It continues through puberty reaching an adult uterine body to cervix ratio of 2:1 (Option C) . Reference: Williams Gynecology, 4th Edition, Pg 321, 322",

      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: C) Constitutional Delay of Growth and Puberty Explanation: Constitutional delay of growth and puberty is the most common cause of delayed puberty in adolescents. The girl's consistent growth pattern, family history, and absence of chronic illnesses support this diagnosis. Delayed Puberty refers to: No periods till 13 years if secondary sexual characters are absent. No periods till 15 years if secondary sexual characters are present.

      "question": "A 14-year-old girl presents to the clinic with complaints of severe lower abdominal pain that has occurred cyclically every month for the past six months, but she has never had a menstrual period. She reports no other significant symptoms. On physical examination, her secondary sexual characteristics are well-developed (Tanner stage 4).

        "D": "Müllerian Agenesis - Primary Amenorrhea"
      },
      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: C) Imperforate Hymen - Cryptomenorrhea Explanation: Imperforate hymen is a common cause of primary amenorrhea with cyclic abdominal pain. A bulging, bluish membrane at the introitus is a classic sign of this condition, indicating the accumulation of menstrual blood behind the hymen. Cryptomenorrhea is a type of primary amenorrhea in which menstruation occurs but is not visible due to obstruction of the outflow tract (such as Imperforate hymen). Primary Amenorrhea is diagnosed when a young girl who has not yet menstruated by: 13 years (in the absence of secondary sexual characters). 15 years (regardless of the presence of secondary sexual characters). Causes of Primary Amenorrhea Hypergonadotropic hypogonadism Primary ovarian failure Resistant ovarian syndrome Galactosemia Developmental defect of genital tract Müllerian agenesis (2nd most common cause) Imperforate hymen (Cryptomenorrhea) Vaginal agenesis Transverse vaginal septum Hypogonadotropic hypogonadism Hypothalamic and pituitary dysfunction Kallmann’s syndrome Craniopharyngioma Abnormal chromosomal pattern Turner’s syndrome (most common cause) Pure gonadal dysgenesis Androgen insensitivity syndrome Transverse Vaginal Septum - Primary Amenorrhea (Option A): On examination, the hymen would appear normal because the obstruction is higher up in the vaginal canal, not at the introitus. Androgen Insensitivity Syndrome (AIS) - Primary Amenorrhea (Option C): In AIS, the patient has a 46,XY karyotype and is genetically male but resistant to androgens, leading to female external genitalia. These patients lack a uterus, fallopian tubes, and upper vagina due to normal regression of the Müllerian structures (induced by anti-Müllerian hormone). Therefore, there would be no menstruation and no cyclic abdominal pain. Examination may reveal a short and blind ending vagina. Müllerian Agenesis - Primary Amenorrhea (Option D): In Müllerian agenesis, the patient has a 46,XX karyotype and normal ovarian function, so secondary sexual characteristics develop normally. However, there is an absence of the uterus, upper vagina, and fallopian tubes, so the patient would not experience cyclic abdominal pain as there is no menstruation. The examination would reveal a shortened or absent vagina, not a bluish bulging hymen.",

Menopause (Option A) is defined as the permanent cessation of menstruation due to the loss of ovarian follicular activity, typically diagnosed retrospectively after 12 consecutive months of amenorrhea. While this patient is experiencing menstrual irregularities, she does not meet the criteria for menopause. Premature (Option B) menopause is defined as menopause occurring at or below the age of 40. Given the patient's age of 46, this diagnosis is not applicable. Late menopause (Option C) occurs when menopause is reached after the age of 55.

      },
      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: A) Decreased inhibin levels Explanation: Irregular menstrual periods, hot flashes, night sweats, and vaginal dryness are common signs of menopause, caused by declining estrogen levels Decreased inhibin levels (Option A) contribute to the rise in FSH levels during the menopausal transition. Inhibin normally suppresses FSH production, so its decline leads to increased FSH secretion , which is consistent with the patient's elevated FSH levels. Increased LH levels (Option B) also occur during menopause due to decreased estradiol feedback on the hypothalamus and pituitary gland. However, LH alone does not directly explain the symptoms described. Declining progesterone levels (Option C) are expected during menopause but are less likely to be the primary cause of the symptoms such as hot flashes and vaginal dryness. Increase in estrogen-to-androgen ratio (Option D) During menopause, ovarian stromal cells increase androgen production due to elevated LH. Although androgen levels rise in ovaries, their peripheral levels reduce due to conversion to estrone in adipose tissue, causing a decreased estrogen-to-androgen ratio . This change results in increased facial hair growth and alterations in voice. Reference: Williams Gynecology, 4th Edition, Pg 113, 182, 187",

      "correct_answer": "D",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: D) Estrogen-progestin therapy Explanation: Estrogen-progestin therapy is the most effective treatment for managing hot flashes and other menopausal symptoms in women with an intact uterus. Unopposed estrogen therapy can lead to endometrial hyperplasia and an increased risk of endometrial cancer. Estrogen therapy (Option C) alone is preferred in postmenopausal women with a hysterectomy status. Calcium and vitamin D supplementation (Option B) are essential for bone health but do not directly address hot flashes. Low-dose vaginal estrogen (Option A) is effective for treating vaginal dryness and genitourinary symptoms but is less commonly used specifically for managing hot flashes. Other common symptoms of Menopause : Dyspareunia, dysuria, vaginal dryness, infections, urgency, and incontinence. Thinning, loss of elasticity, and wrinkling of the skin. Increased anxiety, headache, insomnia, irritability, difficulty concentrating, and depression. Loss of bone mass, increasing the risk of osteoporosis and fractures. Non-Hormonal Therapy for Menopause: Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors (SSRIs) have shown effectiveness in reducing the severity and duration of hot flashes, especially when estrogen therapy is not advisable. Clonidine: This α 2 adrenergic agonist can help reduce hot flashes and night sweats. Bazedoxifene: This Selective Estrogen Receptor Modulator is often combined with estrogen to manage vasomotor symptoms in women with an intact uterus. Phytoestrogens (isoflavones): Found in foods like soy, phytoestrogens may help lower the incidence of vasomotor symptoms, osteoporosis, and cardiovascular disease. Vitamin E: May provide some relief from hot flashes. Reference: Williams Gynecology, 4th Edition, Pg 113, 311",

Hormonal testing reveals elevated serum follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) levels and low estradiol levels. Which of the following is false in this condition?",
      "options": {
        "A": "Ovarian biopsy is essential to the diagnosis",
        "B": "Can have an autoimmune etiology",
        "C": "Due to an accelerated rate of germ cell depletion",
        "D": "Due to the failure of germ cell migration in intrauterine life"
      },
      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: A) Ovarian biopsy is essential to the diagnosis Explanation: The condition described is primary ovarian insufficiency (POI), which is characterized by irregular menstrual periods, symptoms of estrogen deficiency (such as hot flashes and night sweats), elevated FSH levels, and low estradiol levels. Primary/Premature ovarian insufficiency (POI) is defined as ovarian failure occurring before the age of 40. It occurs due to a failure of germ cell migration (Option D) or an accelerated rate of germ cell depletion during intrauterine life (Option C) This results in few or no follicles left in the ovary by puberty. Ovarian biopsy is not essential to the diagnosis of premature ovarian insufficiency (Option A) . Causes of POI: Genetic: Turner’s syndrome (45, XO), Fragile X syndrome Iatrogenic: Chemotherapy, radiotherapy, ovarian surgery Infectious: Mumps oophoritis, Autoimmune Oophoritis (Option B) Environmental: Smoking, Pesticides FSH receptor abnormalities: Absent or defective FSH receptors, also known as Savage’s syndrome , the clinical features of it includes normal secondary sexual characteristics, regular female karyotype, and usual ovarian reserve, but elevated endogenous gonadotropin levels and low estrogen levels with primary or secondary amenorrhea). Idiopathic Management of POI: Hormone Replacement Therapy (HRT): To prevent or minimize postmenopausal health risks Corticosteroids: May be helpful in cases of autoimmune disorders Ovulation induction: May be attempted in the presence of follicles using sequential estrogen and progesterone or a GnRH agonist followed by gonadotropins Reference: Williams Gynecology, 4th Edition, Page 375, 376, 436",
