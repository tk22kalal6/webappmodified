      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: B) Cusco vaginal speculum Explanation: The image shows a Cusco vaginal speculum , a commonly used instrument in gynecological examinations. Key Features: Design : Bivalve speculum with two symmetrical blades Material : Stainless steel Mechanism : Self-retaining with adjustable width Operation : Opens in an anterior-posterior direction Clinical Applications: Visualization of cervix Vaginal examination Pap smear collection IUD insertion Graves vaginal speculum (Option A): Has wider blades than Cusco Uses- Performing pelvic & cervical examinations Pap Smears Inserting IUCD Sims speculum (Option C): L-shaped design with one side longer than the other. Uses- Inspect cervix and vagina post-delivery Clean vagina following delivery Inspect for local causes of APH (bleeding) Used during D&E operations Collection of samples (blood, urine in VVF) Auvard speculum (Option D): Weighted speculum Self-retaining via weighted mechanism Uses- Posterior vaginal wall retraction during operations Used in anterior colporrhaphy Used in vaginal hysterectomy",

      "question": "A primigravida patient at 40 weeks of gestation started to have labour pain. She is in the second stage of the labour with fetal station at +3 and caput +1. What will be the management?",
      "options": {
        "A": "Vacuum",
        "B": "Outlet forceps",
        "C": "Low cavity forceps",
        "D": "Wait and observe"
      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "visible at the perineum and the fetal station is +3, indicating that the head is well engaged and close to delivery. This type of forceps is used to assist the delivery of the baby when the head is in this low station and there is a need to expedite the delivery for maternal or fetal reasons. Incorrect Options: (Option A) Vacuum: Vacuum extraction can be used for assisted vaginal delivery, but it is generally more appropriate when the fetal head is slightly higher, such as at +2 or lower stations. At +3 station, outlet forceps are typically preferred. (Option C) Low cavity forceps: Low cavity forceps are used when the fetal head is at a higher station (+2 or lower) and not yet at the perineum. Since the fetal head is already at +3 station in this case, low cavity forceps are not appropriate. (Option D) Wait and observe: While waiting and observing can be an option in certain cases, at +3 station with labour pain and caput +1, it is usually advisable to assist delivery to avoid prolonged labour and potential complications.

      "question": "The given instrument is used in:",
      "options": {
        "A": "Vaginal hysterectomy",
        "B": "Cesarean section",

      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "procedures. Cesarean section, also known as C-section, is a surgical procedure in which a baby is delivered through an incision made in the mother's abdomen and uterus. The Doyen's retractor is designed to hold and retract the edges of the abdominal incision, allowing better visualization and access to the uterus for the surgeon during the procedure. Incorrect Options: Option A:Vaginal hysterectomy: The Doyen's retractor is not typically used in vaginal hysterectomy procedures. Vaginal hysterectomy involves the removal of the uterus through the vagina, and different instruments are usually used for this type of surgery. Option C: Manchester operation: The Doyen's retractor is not commonly associated with the Manchester operation, which is a specific surgical technique for treating uterine prolapse. Different retractors and instruments may be used in the Manchester operation. Option D: Fothergill's surgery: Fothergill's surgery, typically performed for anal fistula treatment, does not typically require the use of the Doyen's retractor. Other specialized instruments may be used for this procedure.",
