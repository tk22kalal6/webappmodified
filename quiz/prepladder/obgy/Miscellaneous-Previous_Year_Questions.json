Antihypertensive Treatment During Pregnancy First-line drugs: Drug Class Examples Notes Beta-blockers Labetalol (Option C) Preferred. Generally safe and effective Calcium channel blockers Nifedipine (Option D) , Amlodipine Safe, less BP variability compared to labetalol Alpha-2 agonist Methyl dopa (Option A) Safe but less effective in severe hypertension. It works by reducing sympathetic outflow and vascular resistance. However, it has sedative effects and may cause fatigue or depression. Labetalol is commonly used to treat acute severe hypertension in pregnancy. Initial IV dose: 10–20 mg, then 20–80 mg every 10–30 mins up to 300 mg. Continuous IV infusion: 1–2 mg/min. Fewer side effects than alternatives; less tachycardia. Avoid in asthma, heart disease, compromised heart function, heart block, or bradycardia. Second-line drugs: Drug Class Examples Notes Vasodilators Hydralazine Reserved for cases with cardiac/renal dysfunction Contraindicated drugs: Drug Class Examples Notes ACE inhibitors Enalapril, Lisinopril Associated with severe fetal malformations Angiotensin-receptor blockers Losartan, Valsartan Not recommended at any point during pregnancy Pre-existing Medication Management: G ACE Inhibitors/ARBs: Discontinue immediately upon pregnancy recognition. G Other Antihypertensives: I Mild/Moderate Hypertension: Some guidelines suggest discontinuation in the first trimester and restart if BP approaches severe range.

      "question": "A female patient, who is in the 8th week of her pregnancy, came for medical termination of pregnancy (MTP). What would be the correct dosage of Misoprostol given through the mucosal route?",
      "options": {
        "A": "200 mcg",
        "B": "600 mcg",
        "C": "400 mcg",

      },
      "correct_answer": "D",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: D) 800 mcg Explanation: In pregnancy greater than 7 weeks, a higher dose of 800 mcg may be used as a single dose or in divided doses to further facilitate the completion of the abortion process. Medical Termination of Pregnancy (MTP) Act: The original act was passed in 1971 and amended in 2021. Indications : Maternal Risk Fetal Risk: Spina bifida, Down syndrome. Eugenic Conditions: Risks to both mother and fetus. Humanitarian Cause: Pregnancy resulting from rape. Contraceptive Failure. Qualifications : MBBS, MD/DNB/DGO MBBS who has trained in gynaecology for 6 months MBBS who has performed 25 MTPs under supervision ASHA and AYUSH cannot perform MTP. Additions of 2021 amendment: Abortions allowed up to 20-24 weeks. <20 weeks - Single doctor’s decision; 20-24 weeks - 2 doctors. Extension of abortion rights to single, unmarried females. Inclusion of marital rape under the MTP Act. Abortions >24 weeks in cases of significant fetal anomalies with no gestational upper limit, are to be decided by a state medical board (gynecologist, pediatrician, radiologist). Gestational Age Abortive method Up to 7 weeks Medical Abortion. (99% success rate if done before 7 weeks) Up to 9 weeks Up to 10 weeks Medical Abortion Suction evacuation Up to 12 weeks Suction evacuation Dilatation and Curettage (D&C) 12-20 weeks Dilatation and Evacuation (D&E) 20-24 weeks Dilatation and Evacuation (D&E) Prostaglandin Induction. >24 weeks Hysterotomy Stepwise Approach for MTP: Mifepristone (200mg): Administered orally on day 1. Mifepristone is a progesterone antagonist, which leads to the detachment of the pregnancy from the uterine lining, causing fetal death. Misoprostol (800 mcg): Administered 24-48 hours later through vaginal, sublingual, or buccal routes. Misoprostol induces uterine contractions to expel the pregnancy. Confirmation: Clinical confirmation of MTP is done on day 14 after the procedure to ensure the termination is complete. Reference: Williams Obstetrics, 26th Edition, Page: 212.",
