        "D": "Reassure"
      },
      "correct_answer": "D",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: D) Reassure Explanation: Postpartum amenorrhea is common, especially in breastfeeding women. During breastfeeding, prolactin levels increase, which suppresses the release of FSH and LH, leading to temporary amenorrhea. Reassurance is the appropriate step before considering any invasive measures or treatment options. Incorrect Options: Laparoscopic ovarian drilling (Option A) is not indicated for managing postpartum amenorrhea unless there are specific concerns such as polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS). Contraceptives (Option B) may not be necessary if the patient wishes to conceive or if there are no medical indications requiring contraception. Pulsatile GnRH (Option C) is typically used for conditions like hypothalamic amenorrhea or specific hormonal imbalances but is not the first-line approach for postpartum amenorrhea.

      "explanation": "Correct Answer: A) Prolactin level Explanation: The symptoms described, amenorrhea, headache, blurred vision, and galactorrhea —are classic signs of hyperprolactinemia, often caused by a prolactinoma (pituitary adenoma). Measuring serum prolactin levels is the most appropriate initial investigation to confirm the diagnosis. Elevated prolactin levels help pinpoint the cause and guide further management. Incorrect Options: Although LH (Option B) can be affected in conditions of pituitary dysfunction, it is not the first-line investigation for a patient presenting with hyperprolactinemia symptoms. FSH (Option C) evaluation is more relevant in cases of primary ovarian insufficiency or menopause, not hyperprolactinemia. hCG (Option D) is used to confirm pregnancy, which does not align with the clinical symptoms described in this case.

      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: C) Imperforate hymen Explanation: Based on the given scenario, the patient presents with primary amenorrhea and cyclical pain, along with a vaginal bulge , suggesting cryptomenorrhea . Cryptomenorrhea occurs when menstrual blood accumulates in the uterus due to an obstruction in the vaginal outflow tract, preventing its release. The most common cause of cryptomenorrhea is imperforate hymen , where the hymen is completely sealed, obstructing menstrual flow. The treatment typically involves making cruciate incisions to create an opening for the menstrual flow. Cryptomenorrhea Causes Congenital Causes: Imperforate hymen Transverse vaginal septum Atresia of upper-third of vagina and cervix Acquired Causes: Stenosis of the cervix following amputation, deep cauterization and conization Secondary vaginal atresia following neglected and difficult vaginal delivery. Clinical Features Patients are usually around 13-15 years old (congenital cases). Symptoms: Periodic lower abdominal pain and, in cases of hematocolpos, urine retention occurs Physical Examination: An abdominal exam reveals a uniform globular mass in the hypogastrium. Vulvar inspection shows a bulging hymen. Rectal examination confirms a full vagina and uterine mass. Management Imperforate Hymen: Perform a cruciate incision and drain the accumulated blood. Cervical Stenosis: Dilate the cervix to relieve the obstruction. Reference: William’s Gynecology, 4th edition, Page: 418,419. https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9464463/",

      },
      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: C) Turner’s syndrome Explanation: Turner’s syndrome is a chromosomal abnormality characterized by partial or complete monosomy of the X chromosome. The patient in the scenario exhibits typical features of Turner’s syndrome, including: Webbed neck Short stature Streak ovaries Low hairline at the back of the neck Lack of secondary sexual characteristics Widely spaced nipples These features are highly suggestive of Turner’s syndrome, which occurs when a female has only one functioning X chromosome or has abnormalities in the second X chromosome. Incorrect Options: Testicular feminizing syndrome (Option A), also known as androgen insensitivity syndrome, this condition involves the partial or complete inability of cells to respond to androgens, leading to a female phenotype despite a male genotype (XY). It is not associated with the features described in the scenario. Kallmann syndrome (Option B) is characterized by anosmia (loss of sense of smell) and hypogonadotropic hypogonadism, leading to delayed or absent puberty. The absence of anosmia in the patient makes Kallmann syndrome unlikely in this case. Klinefelter syndrome (Option D), typically described by the chromosomal pattern 47, XXY, involves males with an extra X chromosome. Common features include infertility and small, poorly functioning testicles, but this syndrome does not present with the characteristic features observed in this patient, such as webbed neck or streak ovaries.

        "D": "Bilateral cornual block"
      },
      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: A) Bilateral hydrosalpinx Explanation: In the given hysterosalpingogram, bilateral hydrosalpinx is observed. This condition is characterized by the dilation of the fallopian tubes, specifically the ampulla, and they appear retort-shaped. The tubes are filled with clear fluid, and the contrast dye enters through the open interstitial ends but cannot leave because the fimbrial ends are closed. This blockage results in the typical appearance of hydrosalpinx on HSG. Hysterosalpingography (HSG): Visualising the uterine cavity & fallopian tubes by retrograde injection of radiocontrast dye to identify filling defects & blocks. Preparation NSAID 30 minutes before to prevent tubal spasm. Paracervical block in patients with cervical stenosis. 4 phases of radiographic images taken Pre-contrast preliminary. During contrast filling. Contrast spillage into peritoneum. During deflation and withdrawal. Contraindications Acute pelvic infections. Active uterine bleeding. Allergic to iodine. Pregnancy. Doxycycline can be given If dilated tubes are identified (indicating previous pelvic infection). As prophylaxis to prevent infections post-HSG. Complications Pelvic discomfort. Uterine perforation. Vasovagal reactions. Dye allergy. Intravascular dissemination of the dye. Extravasation into the venous system (Option B) refers to the leakage of contrast dye into the pelvis and bloodstream, indicating patency of the fallopian tubes, which is not observed in this case. The image in the scenario shows a closed system, indicative of a blockage. A normal HSG (Option C) would show the dye flowing freely through the fallopian tubes and spilling out into the peritoneal cavity, indicating no blockages. The findings in this case are not consistent with normal HSG. A bilateral cornual block (Option D) would show the fallopian tubes blocked at the uterine junction, which would prevent the contrast from moving through the tubes entirely. However, in this case, the issue is at the fimbrial ends, not at the cornual ends, and the tubes are dilated, indicating hydrosalpinx, not a cornual block.",

        "A": "Ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome",
        "B": "Theca lutein cyst",
        "C": "Polycystic ovarian syndrome",
        "D": "None"
      },
      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: A) Ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome Explanation: The finding in the ultrasound in a woman with a history of infertility and treatment with human menopausal gonadotropin is suggestive of ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (OHSS) (Option A) . Ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (OHSS) is a potential complication of fertility treatments, particularly those involving the use of gonadotropin medications. In OHSS, the ovaries become enlarged due to the production of multiple follicles and increased vascular permeability, leading to the accumulation of fluid in the abdominal cavity. This can cause symptoms such as abdominal pain, bloating, nausea, and vomiting. Incorrect Options: Theca lutein cysts (Option B) are fluid-filled cysts that can develop in the ovaries in response to high levels of human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG), which is often administered as part of fertility treatments. However, the presence of theca lutein cysts on ultrasound does not specifically indicate OHSS. These cysts are typically benign and resolve on their own without treatment. Polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS) (Option C) is a hormonal disorder characterized by enlarged ovaries containing multiple small cysts. While PCOS can cause infertility, the presence of PCOS alone does not explain the specific ultrasound finding described in the question. PCOS is not directly related to the use of human menopausal gonadotropin or the development of OHSS.",

        "D": "Laparotomy and metroplasty"
      },
      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: C) Hysteroscopy and septoplasty Explanation: Hysteroscopy with septoplasty is the appropriate management as it removes the uterine septum, addressing infertility in the patient. Hysteroscopic septoplasty : Minimally invasive procedure used to resect a uterine septum under hysteroscopic guidance. It involves the use of a resectoscope or laser for precise removal. The procedure avoids uterine scarring, reduces the need for cesarean sections in future pregnancies, and minimizes the risk of pelvic adhesions compared to transabdominal approaches. Postoperative live birth rates are approximately 85%. Uterine septum: Results from incomplete regression of the medial müllerian ducts during their fusion. It can partially or completely divide the uterine cavity and may project from the fundus or extend to the cervix. It is the most common congenital uterine malformation in women with infertility. Associated complications include infertility, malpresentation, and increased risk of first- and second-trimester pregnancy loss. Hysterectomy (Option A) is not appropriate as it involves the removal of the uterus, which is unnecessary for a correctable condition like a uterine septum and would prevent future fertility. Laparoscopy and metroplasty (Option B) are not preferred as they may require cesarean delivery and can cause pelvic adhesions, leading to infertility. Hysteroscopy with septoplasty directly removes the septum with fewer risks. Laparotomy and metroplasty (Option D) are not preferred for treating a septate uterus due to the need for cesarean delivery in future pregnancies to prevent uterine rupture and the risk of postoperative pelvic adhesions, which can lead to infertility.

Hysteroscopy (Option A) is an operative procedure where a thin, lighted instrument (hysteroscope) is inserted through the vagina and cervix to directly visualize the uterine cavity, aiding in diagnosing and treating uterine conditions. Saline infusion sonography (Option B) involves injecting sterile saline into the uterus and using transvaginal ultrasound to assess uterine abnormalities like polyps, fibroids, or septa. Transvaginal ultrasonography (Option D) is a non-invasive imaging technique using high-frequency sound waves to visualize pelvic organs, commonly assessing ovarian cysts, endometrial thickness, and follicle development during fertility treatments.

      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Correct answer: B) Hypomenorrhea Explanation: Asherman syndrome is most commonly associated with hypomenorrhea. Hypomenorrhoea refers to regularly timed but scanty episodes of bleeding. Asherman Syndrome: It is a condition characterized by intrauterine adhesions or synechiae caused by the formation of scar tissue within the uterus or cervix due to trauma to the uterine cavity or damage to the basal layer of the endometrium. Pathophysiology: Trauma to the basal layer of the endometrium triggers inflammation, forming adhesive bands between opposing areas of the uterine cavity. Risk Factors: Uterine surgery or dilation and curettage. Abnormal placentation, such as placenta increta, which invades below the basal layer of the endometrium. Symptoms: Hypomenorrhea or amenorrhea. Severe dysmenorrhea, especially if menstrual flow is obstructed. Recurrent miscarriages or infertility due to impaired endometrial vascularization. Diagnosis: Saline sonography or hysterosalpingography to visualize adhesions. Treatment: Hysteroscopic adhesiolysis. Oligomenorrhoea (Option A) denotes infrequent and irregularly timed episodes of bleeding, usually occurring at intervals of more than 35 days. Dysmenorrhoea (Option C) means cramping pain accompanying menstruation. Menorrhagia (Option D) denotes regularly timed episodes of bleeding that are excessive in amount (>80 mL) and/or duration of flow (>5 days).

      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "Correct answer: A) Serum FSH levels Explanation: Serum FSH level is the next best test to differentiate between an obstructive and a testicular cause of azoospermia. Elevated FSH levels suggest a non-obstructive, testicular cause of azoospermia or primary gonadal failure. Low FSH levels are observed in cases of pituitary or hypothalamic failure. Normal FSH levels could be due to obstructive (post-testicular cause) or non-obstructive (testicular cause) azoospermia. Azoospermia: Refers to no sperm in semen. Causes of Azoospermia: 1. Pre-testicular (central): endocrine disorders (low LH and FSH) Hypogonadotropic hypogonadism/ Kallman syndrome Endocrine: Hyperprolactinemia, obesity, thyroid disorder Drugs: Antihypertensives, Antipsychotics 2. Testicular (peripheral): Intrinsic disorders (High FSH and LH) Genetic disorders: Klinefelter syndrome (Most common) Immotile cilia (Kartagener) syndrome Varicocele: Most common reversible cause Undescended testes Testicular torsion Mumps orchitis Heat exposure: Miners Toxins: smoking, radiation, drug abuse Oligoasthenoteratozoospermia 3. Post-testicular: (Normal LH and FSH) Congenital : Absent vas deferens (cystic fibrosis), Young’s syndrome Obstruction : Epididymal and Ejaculatory duct obstruction Acquired : Genital TB, gonorrhoea Surgical : herniorrhaphy, vasectomy, bladder neck surgery Other: Retrograde ejaculation, hypospadias Serum Testosterone Levels (Option B): Low testosterone levels might indicate a testicular cause of azoospermia but are not specific enough to differentiate between obstructive and non-obstructive azoospermia. Testicular Biopsy (Option C): While this procedure is essential for confirming the exact cause, it is invasive and typically reserved for cases where non-invasive tests like serum FSH levels fail to provide clarity. Serum LH Levels (Option D): Elevated LH levels may suggest a testicular cause of azoospermia, but like FSH, they cannot specifically distinguish between obstructive and non-obstructive azoospermia.

Hydrosalpinx: Definition : Distention of fallopian tube with fluid Appearance : Characteristic S-shaped or serpentine structure HSG finding : Dilated, convoluted fallopian tubes Distribution : Can be unilateral or bilateral Hysterosalpingography It is a radiographic imaging technique. Indication: Infertility evaluation To assess the endocervical canal, the endometrial cavity, and the fallopian tube lumina and patency. Procedure: Radiopaque contrast material is injected through the cervical canal. It is performed between cycle days 5 and 10. Normal findings: The spill of contrast from the tubes into the peritoneal cavity suggests patency of the fallopian tubes. The endometrial cavity is usually triangular and has a smooth contour. Contraindications: Acute pelvic infection Active uterine bleeding Pregnancy Iodine allergy Normal HSG (Option A) : In a normal HSG, fallopian tubes appear as thin, linear structures with free spillage of contrast into the peritoneal cavity. The S-shaped dilated appearance is not seen in normal tubes. The radiograph below shows normal HSG. Bilateral cornual block (Option B): Cornual block shows complete obstruction at the proximal fallopian tubes with no filling of the tubes beyond the cornual region.

      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: A) Tubal salpingitis Explanation: The clinical findings indicate Tubal salpingitis , indicated by the characteristic \"Tobacco pouch\" appearance on hysterosalpingogram. Tubal Salpingitis causes granulomas to grow in the mucosa and on the surface of the tubes at first. These granulomas undergo caseous ulceration leading to mucosal irregularity, which manifests as the ragged contour of the lumen of the tubes and diverticular outpouchings ( salpingitis isthmica nodosa [SIN] appearance on hysterosalpingography [HSG]). Tobacco pouch appearance occurs because of the version of the fimbria secondary to adhesions , with a patent orifice producing the tobacco pouch appearance Appearance of the Tubes: The tubal infection starts as endosalpingitis and is usually bilateral Calcific, rigid, and beaded in appearance Tubes are mostly blocked, causing hydrosalpinx Tobacco pouch shaped Retort shaped hydrosalpinx Incorrect Options: Tubal endometriosis (Option B) : The appearance of the tobacco pouch on the hysterosalpingogram is not indicative of tubal endometriosis. Tubal polyp (Option C) : HSG can reveal abnormalities on the inside of the uterus, such as polyps, fibroids, adhesions, and/or a uterine septum. However, tubal polyps appear as smooth, rounded, or oval fillings. Tubal spasm (Option D) : The tubal spasm occurs when the tubal muscles contract and therefore block the tubes, which is not seen in the radiological image. It is often caused when the HSG dye is forcefully injected. Reference: https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3901176/",

      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: B) 14-year-old girl with Tanner stage 1 breasts Explanation: Primary amenorrhea is defined as the absence of menstruation by 14 years without the development of s econdary sexual characteristics (such as breast development) or by 16 years, regardless of the presence of secondary sexual characteristics. A 14-year-old girl with Tanner stage 1 breasts (prepubertal breasts) would be classified as having primary amenorrhea because she has not reached the expected developmental milestones for her age. Tanner Staging for Female Puberty Stage Breast Development (Thelarche) Pubic Hair Development (Pubarche) Stage I Prepubertal: No breast development Prepubertal: No pubic hair Stage II Breast bud forms; areola enlarges Sparse, straight, and slightly pigmented hair along labia Stage III Breast tissue and areola continue to enlarge Darker, coarser, and curlier hair on the mons pubis Stage IV Areola and nipple form a secondary mound above the level of the breast Hair becomes more adult-like, but does not extend to thighs Stage V Adult breast contour; areola returns to normal size, nipple projects Adult distribution of pubic hair, extends to thighs Tanner Staging for Male Puberty Stage Genital Development Pubic Hair Development Stage I Prepubertal: No genital development Prepubertal: No pubic hair Stage II Enlargement of the scrotum and testes; skin of scrotum becomes reddened and thinner Sparse, straight, and slightly pigmented hair at the base of the penis Stage III Increase in size of penis (length); further growth of testes and scrotum Darker, coarser, and curlier hair, extending over pubis Stage IV Penis continues to enlarge (length and breadth); glans penis becomes more prominent Pubic hair becomes adult-like, but does not extend to thighs Stage V Adult genitalia: Fully developed penis, testes, and scrotum Adult distribution of pubic hair, extends to thighs 11-year-old girl with Tanner stage 1 breasts (Option A): At age 11, it is still within the normal range for a girl to be in Tanner stage 1, so this would not be classified as primary amenorrhea unless menstruation has not occurred by age 14. 13-year-old girl with Tanner stage 5 breasts (Option C): Tanner stage 5 corresponds to fully developed breasts, indicating that puberty is complete. At 13 years of age with Tanner stage 5 breasts, menstruation would typically have already occurred, so this patient would not have primary amenorrhea. 12-year-old with Tanner stage 4 breasts (Option D): Tanner stage 4 represents the onset of puberty, with the breasts having developed but not fully mature. A 12-year-old in Tanner stage 4 would still be within the normal developmental range, and menstruation could be expected soon. Therefore, this would not be classified as primary amenorrhea.

      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: A) Cystic fibrosis Explanation: In cystic fibrosis, there is a congenital bilateral absence of the vas deferens (CBAVD). Cystic fibrosis is an autosomal recessive disorder caused by mutations in the CFTR gene, leading to abnormally thick and viscous secretions that obstruct organ passages. CBAVD can be the only clinical feature suggesting a CFTR mutation. On examination, the reproductive tract appears normal except for the bilateral absence of the vas deferens and atrophic or absent seminal vesicles. Men with CF also present with azoospermia (no sperm in the semen), low-volume ejaculate, and a lack of seminal vesicle fluid, which normally contains fructose. Some patients may also have associated renal agenesis. Klinefelter syndrome (Option B) is a genetic disorder with a 47, XXY karyotype, leading to infertility due to seminiferous tubule hyalinization and small testes. However, it does not typically cause the bilateral absence of seminal vesicles or vas deferens. Kallmann syndrome (Option C) is characterized by hypogonadism and anosmia (lack of smell) due to a deficiency in GnRH (gonadotropin-releasing hormone), leading to delayed or absent puberty and infertility. While it causes infertility, it does not lead to the absence of the seminal vesicles or vas deferens. Kartagener syndrome (Option D) affects ciliary motility and is characterized by situs inversus (reversal of organ position), chronic sinusitis, and bronchiectasis. Infertility in males results from immotile sperm (asthenospermia) rather than structural absence of seminal vesicles or vas deferens.

Turner syndrome Etiology: The most common sex chromosome abnormality in females with the classical karyotype 45, XO. Pathophysiology: Loss of one X chromosome leads to streak ovaries with inadequate estrogen production, resulting in hypergonadotropic hypogonadism. The reduced estrogen levels fail to provide negative feedback, causing elevated FSH and LH. Clinical Features: Physical: Short stature, webbed neck, shield chest, widely spaced nipples, low posterior hairline. Reproductive: Primary amenorrhea, infertility, absent secondary sexual characteristics (Tanner stage 1 breasts). Cardiac: Coarctation of the aorta, bicuspid aortic valve.

      "explanation": "Correct Answer: C) Primary ciliary dyskinesia Explanation: A male patient with infertility and a history of recurrent lung infections since childhood is most likely to have Primary ciliary dyskinesia. Primary Ciliary Dyskinesia (PCD): A genetically heterogeneous recessive disorder of motile cilia causing oto-sino-pulmonary diseases and organ laterality defects in 50% of cases. Respiratory Distress in Term Neonates: Over 80% of full-term neonates with PCD have respiratory distress, often misdiagnosed as transient tachypnea or pneumonia. Oto-Sino-Pulmonary Manifestations: Early signs: nasal congestion, wet cough, chronic otitis media, recurrent sinus infections, and bronchiectasis. Diagnosis may be missed due to symptom overlap with other respiratory conditions. Lung Diseases: Persistent wet cough and chronic infections lead to bronchiectasis. Lung function may deteriorate early, with worsening spirometry over time. Nonpulmonary Manifestations: Situs Inversus : Seen in 60% of pediatric patients, linked to cilia dysfunction. Congenital Heart Disease : More common in those with situs ambiguus. Fertility : Male infertility due to sperm motility issues ; women may have reduced fertility or ectopic pregnancies. Pectus Excavatum and Scoliosis : Found in 10% and 5–10% of patients, respectively. Celiac disease (Option A) is an autoimmune disorder triggered by gluten consumption, leading to malabsorption with symptoms like diarrhea, abdominal pain, and weight loss, which are absent in this case. It primarily affects the gastrointestinal system, not the respiratory system, making it unlikely in this scenario. Cystic fibrosis (Option B) is an autosomal recessive disorder caused by mutations in the CFTR gene. Diagnostic criteria for cystic fibrosis: One of: Sweat chloride concentration > 60 mmol/l on at least two occasions Two CF-causing mutations Abnormal chloride transport (nasal PD) and One of: Clinical characteristics, typical for CF Sibling with CF Positive newborn screening COPD (Option D) (Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease) is a chronic respiratory condition typically seen in adults, often related to smoking or environmental exposure.

      },
      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: A) Ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome The clinical scenario and the classical USG finding of a spoke wheel appearance all suggest the diagnosis of ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome. Ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome Ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (OHSS) is a potential complication of ovarian stimulation medications, such as human menopausal gonadotropin (hMG). OHSS occurs when the ovaries become excessively stimulated, leading to the development of multiple ovarian cysts and an increase in vascular permeability. This can result in the accumulation of fluid in the abdomen and chest. Clinical features: Abdominal pain & distension Ascites GI symptoms Respiratory compromise Oliguria Hemoconcentration Thromboembolism Investigations: Ultrasound: Enlarged ovaries Ovaries with multiple follicular cysts: Spoke wheel pattern Ascites Treatment: Supportive management Paracentesis for abdominal discomfort and respiratory distress Fluid balance to prevent renal, hepatic, or pulmonary failure (monitor electrolytes) Thromboembolism prophylaxis Polycystic ovarian syndrome (Option B) is a hormonal disorder characterized by multiple cysts in the ovaries, menstrual irregularities, and symptoms such as acne, hirsutism (excessive hair growth), and weight gain. While both PCOS and OHSS can present with ovarian cysts, the sudden onset of symptoms after ovarian stimulation with hMG and the characteristic ultrasound findings make OHSS a more likely diagnosis in this case. Theca lutein cysts (Option C) are a type of functional ovarian cysts that are associated with high levels of beta-human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG), which can occur in conditions such as gestational trophoblastic disease or multiple gestations. These cysts are typically bilateral and can be seen in cases of excessive hCG stimulation. The sudden onset of symptoms and the absence of risk factors for gestational trophoblastic disease or multiple gestations make OHSS a more likely diagnosis. Granulosa cell tumours (Option D) are rare ovarian tumours that arise from the granulosa cells, which are responsible for producing estrogen. While these tumours can cause symptoms such as abdominal pain and hormonal disturbances, they are less common and usually not associated with ovarian stimulation medications.",

      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: B) Reassure and review the couple after 6 months The clinical scenario here shows that the couple have been trying to conceive only for 6 months. For considering infertility, at least 1-year duration of unprotected intercourse of reasonable duration is required, and hence, the best step is to reassure the couple and reevaluate after 6 more months. In couples who are unable to conceive after 1 year of trying, the following evaluations may be done based on the possible causes under suspicion. Evaluation of infertility based on aetiologies Aetiology Evaluation Ovulatory function/ ovarian reserve Ovulation predictor kit Early follicular FSH +/- estradiol level AMH level Endocrine disorders (TSH, prolactin) Ovarian sonography (antral follicle count) Tubal /pelvic disease Hysterosalpingography Laparoscopy + chromotubation Uterine factors Hysterosalpingography TVS /saline infusion sonography +/- MRI Hysteroscopy +/- laparoscopy Male factor Semen analysis Semen analysis (Option A) is an important initial step in evaluating infertility. It assesses the quality and quantity of sperm in the semen. However, in this case, the woman has been trying to conceive for only 6 months, which is below the recommended timeframe for seeking further evaluation. Hysterolaparoscopy (Option C) is a combined diagnostic procedure involving hysteroscopy (visualizing the uterine cavity) and laparoscopy (visualizing the pelvic organs) to assess the female reproductive system for any anatomical abnormalities or conditions that may be affecting fertility. It is an invasive procedure and is typically reserved for cases where there is a suspected underlying pathology or infertility after a longer duration of unsuccessful attempts at conception. Diagnostic hysteroscopy (Option D) is a procedure that allows direct visualization of the uterine cavity using a thin, lighted instrument called a hysteroscope. It is used to evaluate and diagnose uterine abnormalities that may contribute to infertility, such as polyps, fibroids, or intrauterine adhesions. However, similar to hysterolaparoscopy, diagnostic hysteroscopy is not typically the initial step in the evaluation of infertility, especially after only 6 months of trying.

      "explanation": "induction of ovulation Correct answer: D) Weight loss + Folic acid, try for spontaneous induction. If failed, move to induction of ovulation Explanation: In this scenario, since the woman is trying to conceive, she is given folic acid, advised weight loss exercises, and to try for spontaneous induction. If spontaneous conception does not occur, then induction of ovulation can be considered. Conservative management: Fairly regular cycles and mild hyperandrogenism: Need not be treated Obese women with PCOS: Lifestyle changes (diet and exercise) Drugs used to treat Infertility in PCOS: Letrozole (preferred over clomiphene citrate) Aromatase inhibitors No antiestrogenic action on the endometrium and cervix, thus yielding a better pregnancy rate. Induces Mono Follicular stimulation, thus avoiding multiple pregnancies No hyperstimulation syndrome Side effect - drowsiness Clomiphene citrate Unlike letrozole, it has anti-estrogenic action on the endometrium and cervix, thereby decreasing the fertility rate. It can cause hyperstimulation Syndrome in <1% of patients. It induces ovulation in 80% of the cases, and 40-45% conceive. Co-administration of dexamethasone leads to better outcomes. In resistant cases, Tamoxifen 80-160 mg daily for 5 days was tried. Metformin It is used as an insulin sensitiser. Reduces the insulin levels, delays glucose absorption and production of glucose in the liver It also improves the peripheral utilisation of the glucose. Reduces the free and total testosterone, and increases SHBG (sex hormone-binding globulin). Contraindicated in hepatic and renal disease Nowadays, instead of Metformin, some gynaecologists prefer using N-acetyl cysteine with micronutrients. This reduces the homocysteine level and improves fertility outcomes. Metformin, weight reduction, and ovulation induction with clomiphene (Option A) are advised in cases of PCOS with insulin resistance. Metformin is a biguanide insulin sensitizer agent that is used off-label for PCOS to help restore cyclic menstruation, lower hyperandrogenism, and help in weight loss. However, the first line of management for PCOS is weight loss and exercise to manage complications like infertility, CVD, and diabetes. Weight reduction + Metformin + ovulation induction with urinary gonadotropins (Option B), as mentioned above, is used if there is insulin resistance. Urinary gonadotropins are used for the treatment of clomiphene citrate-resistant PCOS, which is not the given scenario. Metformin + Finasteride + Ovulation induction (Option C) is a combination used for PCOS with diabetes and hirsutism. Finasteride blocks the conversion of testosterone to DHT and, being an antiandrogen, should not be given to a woman trying to conceive as it can affect the male fetus.
