      "question": "A 28 year old woman presents with heavy vaginal bleeding and severe lower abdominal pain at 14 weeks gestation. She reports passing large clots and tissue. Per speculum examination reveals an open cervix with active bleeding and presence of fetal tissue in the vagina coming out of the os. What is the most likely type of spontaneous abortion?",
      "options": {
        "A": "Threatened abortion",
        "B": "Inevitable abortion",
        "C": "Incomplete abortion",
        "D": "Missed abortion"
      },
      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: C) Incomplete abortion Explanation: When the entire products of conception are not expelled, instead a part of it is left inside the uterine cavity, it is called an incomplete miscarriage. During incomplete abortion, the cervix opens, and placental separation causes bleeding. Before 10 weeks of gestation, the fetus and the placenta are frequently expelled together, but later, they often deliver separately. Thus, tissue may remain entirely within the uterus or partially extrude through the cervix. Types of Abortions : Induced abortion describes termination with surgery or medication of a live fetus that has not reached viability. Spontaneous abortion (or miscarriage) is defined as the loss of a pregnancy with a fetus aged younger than 20 weeks gestation weighing <500g. Types of Spontaneous Abortion: 1)Threatened Abortion (Option A) Defined as bleeding through a closed cervical os in the first 20 weeks of pregnancy and with a live embryo or fetus. In this type, miscarriage has started but has not progressed to a state from which recovery is impossible. 2) Inevitable Abortion (Option B) Either rupture of placental membranes or marked ballooning of membranes into the vagina may lead to inevitable abortion . In this type of abortion, the changes have progressed to a state where the continuation of pregnancy is impossible. There is dilated internal os and the presence of products of conception. 3) Complete Abortion When the products of conception are expelled en masse, it is called a complete miscarriage. In complete abortion, bleeding and the internal cervical os subsequently closes over the next hour or so. 4) Missed Abortion (Option D) This describes dead products of conception that have been retained for days or weeks within the uterus with a closed cervical os. 5) Incomplete Abortion (Option C) When the entire products of conception are not expelled, instead a part of it is left inside the uterine cavity, it is called incomplete abortion. Septic Abortion : Spontaneous or induced abortion complicated by infection.",

McDonald’s cerclage: More commonly used than Shirodkar's procedure (Option B). A purse-string suture with a non-absorbable suture is applied at the cervicovaginal junction. Shirodkar’s cerclage: The cervicovaginal junction is cut and continuous , non-absorbable sutures (using Mersilene tape ) are applied at the internal os. Wurm’s stitch (or rescue stitch) is used when a woman presents with cervical dilatation and bulging fetal membranes. Transabdominal route: It is done only when vaginal cerclage fails or severe cervical anatomical defects are present. Performed less commonly than vaginal cerclage. The suture is placed abdominally at the uterine isthmus The cerclage is left until childbearing is completed (option C) and therefore cesarean delivery is required (Option D) In both transvaginal and transabdominal procedures, after the placement of cerclage, the patient should be started on progesterone up to 36 weeks+6 days of gestation.",

For such patients, with no history of previous abortions and cervical length of <2.5 cm only progesterone should be initiated until 36 weeks of gestation (Option D). For patients with a history of previous abortions and cervical length of <2.5 cm, both cervical cerclage placement should be done and progesterone should be started (Option C). Emergency cerclage using the Wurm technique should be done in patients with dilated and effaced cervix with intact membranes (Option A). In such cases, it is considered therapeutic rather than preventive. Wurm Technique: Non absorbable suture is used. Used in an emergency, when the cervix is effaced and dilated with intact membranes at the external os. The 1st suture is placed at the level of internal os from 12 '0 clock position to 6' 0 clock and the 2nd suture from 3 '0 clock to 9' 0 clock. High failure rate.",

Explanation: The recommended regimen for this patient’s miscarriage, particularly in the 1st trimester is Mifepristone 200 mg orally followed by Misoprostol 800 mcg vaginally 24 hours later. Mifepristone, an antiprogestin, sensitizes the uterus, and Misoprostol, a prostaglandin, stimulates contractions to expel uterine contents. Trimester Regimen Indication Notes 1st Mifepristone 200 mg orally, followed by Misoprostol 800 mcg vaginally after 24 hours Medical abortion; Miscarriage. Best method with a high success rate. Mifepristone 200 mg orally alone is not effective in MTP. (Option A) Miscarriage Not effective 2nd Mifepristone 200 mg orally, followed by Misoprostol 400 mcg every 3 hours for up to 5 doses MTP Hygroscopic dilators (e.g., laminaria) may be used before administration for cervical ripening. Misoprostol 400 mcg every 3 hours for up to 5 doses MTP Used when Mifepristone is not available. Dinoprostone 20 mg vaginal every 4 hours. (Option C) MTP Less commonly used. High-dose intravenous Oxytocin in saline (Option D) MTP Longer induction duration, hence, rarely used. Complications : Bleeding, Cramping, incomplete abortion. Rh D-negative women should receive anti-D immunoglobulin to prevent Rh alloimmunization. Counselling and provision of post-abortion contraception are essential, as ovulation can occur as early as eight days after an abortion. Reference: Williams Obstetrics, 26th Edition, Page 212.",

      "explanation": "Correct Answer: A)Manual Vacuum Aspiration (MVA) Explanation: MVA is a safe and effective method for surgical management of first-trimester abortions, particularly for gestations up to 12 weeks. Trimester Procedure Description Image 1st Manual Vacuum Aspiration (MVA) MVA is an outpatient surgical abortion procedure used up to 12 weeks of gestation. The procedure involves dilating the cervix and inserting a cannula attached to a manual vacuum aspirator or a 60-mL syringe. The cannula is used to remove retained tissue from the uterus. The approximate pressure is around -610 mmHg. Electric Vacuum Aspiration (EVA) EVA is similar to MVA. Instead of a manual syringe, it uses an electric pump to generate suction to remove retained products of conception. Dilation and Curettage (D&C) (Option B) D&C is performed up to 12 weeks of gestation by dilating the cervix and using instruments like curettes and suction cannula. MVA and EVA are preferred over sharp D&C for being safer and more efficient. 2nd Dilation and Evacuation (D&E) (Option C) D&E is a 2nd-trimester abortion method involving cervical dilation using osmotic dilators. Ovum forceps are then used to remove the pregnancy tissue. Draining amniotic fluid before removing the fetus is crucial to minimize the risk of amniotic fluid embolism during the procedure. Hysterotomy (Option D) A hysterotomy is a surgical procedure where the uterus is incised to remove the fetus. Reserved for 2nd-trimester abortions where other methods are not feasible or have failed.",

      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: B) Incomplete abortion Explanation: The clinical presentation is consistent with incomplete abortion. This type of abortion occurs when some, but not all, products of conception have been expelled from the uterus. Spontaneous abortion, often referred to as miscarriage, is the natural termination of a pregnancy before fetal viability. This typically occurs before 20 weeks of gestation or when the fetus weighs less than 500g (WHO). Type Description Clinical Presentation USG Finding Management Threatened Abortion (option A) Vaginal bleeding during the first 20 weeks of pregnancy while the embryo or fetus is still alive and the cervical os remains closed. Vaginal bleeding: spotting to heavy flow Symptoms: suprapubic discomfort, mild cramps, pelvic pressure TVS: Detects viable intrauterine pregnancy. Fetal cardiac activity (by 6-6.5 weeks), subchorionic hematoma (may be present). Expectant management: Monitor symptoms, acetaminophen for pain relief, avoid sexual intercourse. Progesterone supplementation is not recommended. Incomplete Abortion (Option B) The cervix begins to open. Incompletely expelled products of conception. Heavier vaginal bleeding with cramping. TVS: Retained products of conception in the uterus, and dilated cervix. Surgical evacuation (curettage): High success rate (95-100%). - Expectant management: Higher failure rate (~25%). Medication (Misoprostol): Induces contractions, failure rate 5-30%. Complete Abortion (Option C) All products of conception are expelled from the uterus and the cervix closes. Bleeding subsides, and cramping decreases. TVS: Thin endometrium, no gestational sac. Serial β -hCG is helpful if uncertain. No further intervention is usually needed. Anti D if Rh +ve. Missed Abortion (Option D) Nonviable pregnancy, products of conception retained within the uterus, closed cervix. Disappearance of pregnancy symptoms, light brown vaginal discharge. TVS: Absence of fetal cardiac activity (CRL ≥ 7mm), (or) MSD ≥ 25mm without visible embryo, (or) Lack of embryo growth post-yolk sac presence (11 days) or post-initial scan (2 weeks without yolk sac) Similar to incomplete abortion. Inevitable Abortion of a Previable Fetus Cervical dilation with ruptured membranes (PPROM) or significant membrane ballooning, making continuation impossible. Abundant watery vaginal discharge increases with coughing or the Valsalva manoeuvre. Ultrasound: Confirms PPROM with decreased amniotic fluid or visualization of fluid between amnion and chorion. First Trimester: Leads to uterine contractions or infection, necessitating termination. Second Trimester (Previable): Bleeding or Fever: Immediate uterine evacuation. No Bleeding or Fever: Expectant",
