      "explanation": "Correct answer: A) Blocks Na+ channels Explanation: Image shown is Bupivacaine , a local anesthetic. All local anesthetic acts by inhibiting Na+ channels. Mechanism of action & absorption: Site: acts on nodes of ranvier Blocks transmission of pain impulse from nociceptor to spinal cord. Acts on intracellular side of Na channels at inactivation gate blocking the channel. LA doesn’t affect RMP of nerves. Blocks inactivation gates of Na+ channels → Disrupts depolarisation → No action potential generated → No pain sensation. Highest systemic absorption (routes of administration): IV route >Tracheal > Intercostal > Brachial plexus > Epidural. Form for onset of LA action (to reach target nerve) - Unionized form. Active form at site of block of Na channels- Ionized form. Higher doses will act for longer duration and lower doses for a relatively shorter duration. Duration of onset for different local anesthetics (infiltration anesthesia): Short Duration Procaine Chloroprocaine Moderate Duration Lidocaine Prilocaine Long Duration Bupivacaine Ropivacaine Shortest acting - Chloroprocaine Longest",

      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Correct answer: C) Give 20% intralipid cardiac solution Explanation: The clinical scenario is suggestive of Local anesthetic associated Systemic toxicity (LAST) that has led to CNS (dizziness, seizures) and cardiac effects (bradycardia, hypotension. The definitive management would be to administer 20% intralipid solution . Although other options: Administer IV Lorazepam (Option B) and Airway management (Option D) is also a part of management protocol, but is not the definitive management in this case. Perform Urgent CT Head (Option A) is not required at this stage as there is no history of trauma to the head and the symptoms started a few minutes after administration of local anesthesia. Local Anesthetic Systemic Toxicity (LAST): Clinical Features CNS effects: Early and less severe. First symptom: circumoral paraesthesia First sign: nystagmus At low plasma concentration: mild sensory disturbances. Increased concentration: CNS excitation, seizure activity. Higher concentration: CNS depression, coma, respiratory depression, arrest. Cardiac effects: Usually late but severe form of toxicity, may lead to death. Hypotension, dysrhythmias, myocardial depression. Potent agents (bupivacaine, ropivacaine, levobupivacaine) linked to cardiovascular collapse, heart block. Safety profile Bupivacaine has more risk to cause LAST than Lidocaine Most potent highly lipid soluble drugs are more likely to cause Prevention Risk recognition and dose reduction. Careful aspiration before injection. Incremental administration (3-5 mL) with continuous heart rate monitoring. Use ultrasonographic guidance to confirm anesthetic deposit. Use a vasoactive agent like epinephrine to reduce systemic absorption and serve as an intravascular indicator. Treatment Recognize LAST (Local Anesthetic Systemic Toxicity) early and call for help.

      },
      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: C) Sodium channels Explanation: Cocaine blocks sodium channels , which inhibits the propagation of action potentials in nerve cells, producing its local anesthetic effect. Cocaine : Classification : Ester local anesthetic and CNS stimulant. Mechanism of Action: Blocks sodium channels to inhibit nerve impulses and inhibits reuptake of dopamine, norepinephrine, and serotonin, resulting in CNS stimulant effects. Medical Use: Used for topical anesthesia especially due to its vasoconstrictive properties. Vasoconstriction : Causes vasoconstriction, which helps reduce bleeding and prolong anesthesia during procedures. Duration of Action: Short half life (approx. 1 hour) Metabolism : Metabolized predominantly by hepatic carboxylesterase. CNS Effects: Acts as a strong CNS stimulant, leading to euphoria, increased energy, and potential addiction. Side Effects: Includes hypertension, tachycardia, arrhythmias, seizures, and addiction. Contraindications : Contraindicated in patients with heart disease, hypertension, and seizure disorders because of its cardiovascular and CNS stimulant properties. Chloroprocaine Classification : Ester local anesthetic. Mechanism of Action: Blocks sodium channels, preventing the propagation of nerve impulses to produce local anesthesia. Primarily used for local, epidural, and spinal anesthesia, especially in obstetric procedures(labor and delivery). No Vasoconstriction Duration of Action: Short duration of action due to rapid metabolism by plasma cholinesterase, making it ideal for short surgical procedures. Metabolism : Metabolized quickly by plasma cholinesterase, resulting in a lower risk of systemic toxicity. CNS Effects: Lacks CNS stimulant properties and does not cause euphoria or have any potential for addiction. Side Effects: Generally well-tolerated; possible side effects include allergic reactions due to its ester structure. Minimal systemic effects. Contraindications : Contraindicated in patients allergic to ester-type local anesthetics. Reference: Cocaine Chloroprocaine",

      "question": "What is the major concern associated with bupivacaine toxicity?",
      "options": {
        "A": "Liver toxicity",
        "B": "Nephrotoxicity",
        "C": "Cardiotoxicity",
        "D": "Neurotoxicity"
      },
      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: C) Cardiotoxicity Explanation: Bupivacaine is known for its potential cardiotoxic effects , particularly when administered in high doses or if accidentally injected into a blood vessel, which can lead to severe cardiac arrhythmias and cardiac arrest. Bupivacaine Classification Bupivacaine is an amide-type local anesthetic Mechanism of Action It works by blocking sodium channels in nerve membranes, preventing the propagation of nerve impulses, which results in local anesthesia. Clinical Uses Commonly used for spinal, epidural, and peripheral nerve blocks. Widely used in labor and delivery for epidural anesthesia and in long-duration surgeries. Duration of Action Longer duration of action compared to other local anesthetics like lidocaine. It can provide anesthesia for several hours, making it ideal for prolonged procedures. Onset of Action Has a slower onset (10-15 minutes) compared to faster-acting anesthetics like lidocaine. Cardiotoxicity Major concern with bupivacaine is its potential for cardiotoxicity, especially at higher doses or when inadvertently injected intravenously, leading to severe arrhythmias or cardiac arrest. Metabolism Metabolized primarily in the liver by cytochrome P450 enzymes and excreted by the kidneys. Enantiomers The S-enantiomer of bupivacaine, known as levobupivacaine, is associated with reduced cardiotoxicity and is often used as a safer alternative. Lipid Solubility & Protein Binding Bupivacaine has high lipid solubility and high protein binding, which contributes to its prolonged duration of action. Contraindications Should be avoided in patients with severe cardiac arrhythmias, and caution should be used in patients with liver disease due to its hepatic metabolism. Common Side Effects In addition to cardiotoxicity, other potential side effects include CNS toxicity, such as dizziness, seizures, and lightheadedness, especially with accidental intravascular injection. Toxicity Direct intravenous injection or rapid vascular uptake of the drug is the most common reason for bupivacaine toxicity, which has an upper limit of 2.5 to 3.5 mg/kg upper limit of dosing. Treatment for toxicity: 20% intralipid solution. Reference: Bupivacaine",

        "D": "Metabolizes amide local anesthetics"
      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: B) Hydrolyzes ester-based compounds in the plasma Explanation : Pseudocholinesterase plays a critical role in metabolizing ester-based local anesthetics (chloroprocaine, procaine, tetracaine) and neuromuscular blocking agents (succinylcholine, mivacurium). Pseudocholinesterases : Serine hydrolase enzyme primarily produced in the liver that catalyzes the hydrolysis of choline esters. Drugs Metabolized by Pseudocholinesterase Succinylcholine Use : Neuromuscular blocking agent (commonly used for rapid sequence intubation or short surgical procedures). Mechanism : Succinylcholine is hydrolyzed by pseudocholinesterase in the plasma. Mivacurium Use : Non-depolarizing neuromuscular blocking agent. Mechanism : Mivacurium, like succinylcholine, is metabolized by pseudocholinesterase. Chloroprocaine Use : Local anesthetic (commonly used in obstetric anesthesia). Mechanism : Chloroprocaine is an ester local anesthetic rapidly metabolized by pseudocholinesterase. Procaine Use : Local anesthetic (used in dental procedures and minor surgeries). Mechanism : Procaine, another ester-type local anesthetic, is hydrolyzed by pseudocholinesterase into para-aminobenzoic acid (PABA) and diethylaminoethanol. Tetracaine Use : Local anesthetic (used in spinal and topical anesthesia). Mechanism : Tetracaine is also an ester local anesthetic metabolized by pseudocholinesterase. Breaks down acetylcholine at neuromuscular junctions (Option A) :This function is carried out by acetylcholinesterase. Converts succinylcholine into its active form (Option C): Pseudocholinesterase breaks down succinylcholine, rather than activating it. Metabolizes amide local anesthetics (Option D): Amide local anesthetics (like lidocaine) are metabolized by the liver, not by pseudocholinesterase.

      },
      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: C) Initiate lipid emulsion therapy Explanation : Intravenous Regional Anesthesia (IVRA): Intravenous Regional Anesthesia (IVRA), also known as a Bier block , is a technique that provides local anesthesia to a specific region of the body, typically an extremity, through intravenous administration of a local anesthetic. Indications Suitable for minor surgical procedures on the upper or lower extremities (hand surgeries, forearm procedures, and foot surgeries). Used when general anesthesia is not necessary and for patients with contraindications to other forms of anesthesia. Anesthetic Agents Commonly used local anesthetics include lidocaine (most frequent) and prilocaine. Procedure Steps Tourniquet Application: Apply a tourniquet to the proximal part of the extremity to prevent blood flow and keep the local anesthetic localized. Venous Access: Establish intravenous access in the selected limb. Administration of Anesthetic agent: Inject the local anesthetic into the IV line, typically in a volume of 40-50 mL. Tourniquet Management The tourniquet should be inflated to a pressure that is approximately 50 mmHg above systolic blood pressure. It is typically safe to keep the tourniquet inflated for 30-60 minutes; prolonged inflation can increase the risk of complications. Advantages Provides effective analgesia with minimal systemic absorption. Allows for a bloodless surgical field. Quick onset of action and ease of administration. Disadvantages and Complications Local Anesthetic Systemic Toxicity (LAST) Can occur if the local anesthetic enters the systemic circulation. Tourniquet Pain Nerve Damage Contraindications Infection at the injection site or over the tourniquet. Severe peripheral vascular disease. Patient refusal or inability to cooperate. Lipid Emulsion Therapy Used as a treatment for Local anesthesia systemic toxicity, acts by sequestering the local anesthetic from circulation and mitigating toxic effects. Administer a 20% lipid emulsion intravenously if toxicity occurs.",
