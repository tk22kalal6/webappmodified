This high-flow device is effective for ensuring adequate oxygenation and is commonly used in conditions such as pneumonia, COPD, respiratory failure, post-operative care, and COVID-19. Venturi Mask is also a high-flow device with fixed performance that delivers a precise concentration of oxygen (FiO I ) by mixing oxygen with ambient air at specific flow rates, typically ranging from 2 to 15 L/min.

      "correct_answer": "D",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: D) Can deliver high-flow supplemental oxygen Explanation: The image depicts an Ambu bag or Bag mask ventilation , which is used during CPR, patient transport, and also as an emergency backup during ventilatory failure. It is is designed to provide assisted ventilation, not to deliver high-flow oxygen directly like a non-rebreather mask or high-flow nasal cannula. Mechanism of Bag mask ventilation: During inspiration: A T-shaped non-rebreathing valve sits between the bag and the patient, directing gas flow. It opens during inspiration to allow gas from the bag to the patient while blocking the expiratory port. During exhalation , the inspiratory port is blocked, and the expiratory port opens to vent alveolar gas. Various valve types are available, including spring-disc and fishmouth designs. An inlet valve allows the bag to refill with reservoir gas or room air. A pop-off valve may be included to limit peak inspiratory pressure (PIP), which can become excessively high with these devices. Advantages and disadvantages of Bag mask ventilation: Advantages Disadvantages Compressible reservoir automatically expands upon release. Ubiquitous for patient transport (Option A) . Suitable for CPR (cardiopulmonary resuscitation) (Option B) Can be utilized as emergency back-up (anesthesia machine, ventilator",

Mallampati classification: It evaluates the size of the tongue in relation to the oral cavity. The greater the obstruction of the view of the pharyngeal structures by the tongue, the more challenging intubation may be.

      "question": "A 45-year-old obese female has been experiencing excessive vaginal bleeding for two months, and an ultrasound revealed uterine fibroids. She is scheduled for a hysterectomy. What is the preferred position for laryngoscopy in this case?",
      "options": {
        "A": "Sniffing position",
        "B": "Rose position",
        "C": "Lithotomy position",
        "D": "Ramped position"
      },
      "correct_answer": "D",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: D) Ramped position Explanation: The preferred position for intubation in obese patients is referred to as the Ramped Position , in which the patient's head, neck, and shoulders are elevated with pillows or padding, aligning the external auditory meatus with the sternal notch. This alignment improves the visualisation of the glottis during intubation, optimising airway management and reducing the risk of difficult intubation. Sniffing position (Option A) is used for intubation in non-obese patients, but in obese patients, it may not provide sufficient alignment for a clear view of the vocal cords. The patient is positioned supine with the head elevated on a firm cushion (patients with shorter necks may require less elevation) while flexing the neck and extending the atlanto-occipital joint. Rose position (Option B) : is used during tonsillectomy. The patient lies supine with the head extended by placing a pillow under the shoulders. A rubber ring is placed under the head to stabilise it. Lithotomy position (Option C) is preferred during labour, as well as for examinations or surgeries involving the pelvis, female genitalia, rectum, prostate, and other urethral procedures. The patient lies in a supine position with the buttocks at the lower break of the table. The legs are flexed at the hips to 90°and abducted to 30°, with the knees bent at 70° to 90° and the lower legs supported by padded shells.",

      "explanation": "Correct Answer: B) Miller Laryngoscope Explanation: The Miller laryngoscope is the preferred choice for pediatric patients, especially for children under 8 years of age . It has a straight blade, which is advantageous in lifting the epiglottis directly, providing a better view of the vocal cords in younger patients. Types of Laryngoscopy Direct Laryngoscopy: Direct visualisation of the glottis with the assistance of a laryngoscope Following laryngoscopes are most commonly used: Macintosh Laryngoscope (Option C) Miller Laryngoscope (Option B) McCoy Laryngoscope (Option A) Blade Curved shape Straight shape Curved with levering tip Use In adults In children (large epiglottis) It can be used in both adults and children. Indirect Laryngoscopy: Indirect visualisation of the glottis with the help of optical aids, such as fiberoptic bundles, video cameras, mirrors, prisms, or lenses like: Flexible Intubation Scopes Rigid Indirect Laryngoscopes Lighted Optical Stylets Video Laryngoscopes (C-MAC laryngoscope, McGrath laryngoscope, GlideScope) Airtraq Ambu ascope McGrath laryngoscope (Option D) : It is a video laryngoscope used in cases of difficult intubation.",
