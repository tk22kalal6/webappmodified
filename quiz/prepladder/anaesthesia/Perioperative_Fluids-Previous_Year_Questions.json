      "question": "Which of the following is required for the cannulation of a newborn? 24G needle 16G needle 5-mL syringe Adhesive tape Normal saline",
      "options": {
        "A": "1, 3, 4, 5",
        "B": "2, 3, 4, 5",

        "D": "1, 4"
      },
      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "materials like normal saline and adhesive tape, is critical for safe and effective cannulation in a newborn. 24G needle : The appropriate size for cannulating a newborn due to their small veins. Larger needles like 16G are unsuitable. 5-mL syringe : Often used to flush the cannula or administer medications. Adhesive tape : Essential to secure the cannula in place and prevent dislodgement. Normal saline : Used to flush the cannula and maintain patency. 16G needle (Option A) : This is too large and inappropriate for neonatal veins. (Options C & D) exclude essential items like saline, adhesive tape, or an appropriately sized needle are incomplete for neonatal cannulation.

      "question": "A patient has a road traffic accident and is now bleeding profusely. He is hypotensive and needs large volume replacement with IV fluids. What cannula gauge will you use in this patient?",
      "options": {
        "A": "14 G",
        "B": "13 G",
        "C": "16 G",
        "D": "18 G"
      },
      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: A) 14 G Explanation: 14 G cannula has the thickest diameter with flow rate of 250-300ml is orange color coded cannula, which is used when large volume replacement with IV fluids is needed. Incorrect Options: 13G (Option B) cannula is not present. 16G (Option C) cannula is gray color coded which is commonly used in emergency replacement of fluid volume. 18G (Option D) cannula is green color coded and can also be used in emergency replacement of IV fluids.
