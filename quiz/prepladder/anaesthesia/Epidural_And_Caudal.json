      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: A) CSF drops following guidewire removal Explanation: Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) drops following guidewire removal are observed in spinal anaesthesia, not epidural. Signs for identification of epidural space: Loss of Resistance As the tip of the needle enters the epidural space, there is a sudden loss of resistance. (Option B) Hanging drop test The hub of the needle should be filled with solution, allowing a drop to hang from its external opening, which is sucked in due to high negative pressure in the epidural space). (Option C) Duran sign If the catheter is placed in the epidural space then there is no resistance for the drug to pass (drug passes easily) Westphal sign Absence of PULSATING MOVEMENTS of csf in the catheter confirms correct needle placement in the epidural space. Structures pierced to reach epidural space: Absence of knee-jerk (Option D): Not a primary confirmation, but deep sensory/motor block can occur after successful epidural anaesthesia and could abolish reflexes like the patellar (knee-jerk) reflex depending on drug spread.",

      "question": "A 71-year-old man with COPD, atrial fibrillation, and osteoporosis is admitted for revision hip surgery. The surgical team chooses continuous spinal anaesthesia (CSA) to manage pain and reduce respiratory risks, considering his desire to stay awake. Which of the following is most commonly associated with CSA?",

        "D": "Cauda equina syndrome"
      },
      "correct_answer": "D",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: D) Cauda equina syndrome Explanation: Cauda Equina Syndrome occurs when the cauda equina, a bundle of spinal nerves at the lower end of the spinal cord, is compressed. Continuous Spinal Anesthesia (CSA) can potentially lead to this condition if a complication, such as a hematoma or local anaesthetic spread, affects the nerve roots. Continuous Spinal Anesthesia (CSA) Advantages Disadvantages Better hemodynamic stability (because of predictable titration of the block) Controls arterial blood pressure (in patients with severe aortic stenosis or pregnant women with complex cardiac disease). It can be used in cases of morbid obesity (as previous spinal surgery may hinder epidural spread) Preferred in a few cases of laparotomies (where general anaesthesia may be a risk). Postdural puncture headache (PDPH) Cauda equina syndrome: Spinal cord nerve root compression leading to: Difficulty with micturition Loss of anal sphincter tone or faecal incontinence Saddle anaesthesia Gait disturbance Pain, numbness or weakness affecting one or both legs. Conus medullaris syndrome (Option A) affects the conus medullaris at the end of the spinal cord and is less commonly associated with CSA. It is characterised by lower limb weakness, increased knee reflex, decreased ankle reflex, and extensor plantar reflex. Lumbar spinal stenosis (Option B) occurs with a congenitally narrowed lumbar spinal canal, exacerbated by the degenerative changes that commonly occur with age, characterised by exercise-induced weakness and paraesthesia in the legs, but is not directly associated with CSA. Syringomyelia (Option C) is a condition characterised by the formation of a cyst (syrinx) within the spinal cord. It leads to pain and numbness in the neck, shoulders, arm, or back and is not specifically associated with CSA.",

      "correct_answer": "D",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: D) Rapid recovery of motor function. Explanation: Saddle block is a type of spinal anaesthesia achieved by keeping the patient in a sitting position for 3 to 5 minutes after the injection. This allows for the blockade of only the lower lumbar and sacral nerves. This gives benefits in obstetric, urological, anorectal procedures, and perioperative pain management: Allows the patient to be awake through the procedure (Option A) Reduced systemic side effects Rapid onset and recovery (Option B) Less post-op nausea Minimal motor block (Option C) Complications like urinary retention can be prevented by changing the patient to a jack-knife position after maintaining the initial sitting posture for only one minute. This has a low incidence of hypotension as it does not induce excessive sympathetic blockade compared to spinal block.",

      "correct_answer": "D",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: D) Caudal anaesthesia Explanation: Caudal epidural anaesthesia is a common practice in paediatric age groups . It involves the insertion of a needle or catheter through the sacrococcygeal ligament, which covers the sacral hiatus formed by the un-fused laminae of S4 and S5. It is frequently employed for procedures located below the diaphragm , such as urogenital, rectal, inguinal, and lower extremity surgeries. In adults , it is employed for anorectal procedures , as it provides dense sacral sensory blockade with minimal upward spread . Spinal anaesthesia (Option A) involves injecting anaesthetic into the cerebrospinal fluid but is generally not preferred for young children due to risks of hypotension and prolonged motor blockade. General anaesthesia (Option B) induces unconsciousness and provides complete analgesia, but it carries risks such as airway complications and is often more than necessary for simple procedures like circumcision. Local anaesthesia (Option C) consists of infiltrating anaesthetic agents at the surgical site to achieve localised analgesia. While effective for minor procedures, it may not provide adequate pain relief in paediatric patients who can be uncooperative during surgery.",

      "question": "A 37-year-old male is undergoing inguinal hernia repair with spinal anaesthesia. During the procedure, the patient experiences cardiac arrest. Which anaesthetic drug is likely responsible for this?",
      "options": {
        "A": "Ropivacaine",

        "C": "Chloroprocaine",
        "D": "Bupivacaine"
      },
      "correct_answer": "D",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: D) Bupivacaine Explanation: Bupivacaine is a long-acting local anaesthetic known for its potency and potential for cardiotoxicity. It can lead to severe cardiac complications, including cardiac arrest, especially when used in high doses or inadvertently injected into a blood vessel. CPR and I mmediate infusion of 20% Intralipid (ACLS Protocol) along with incremental doses of epinephrine has been effective in reversing bupivacaine-induced cardiac toxicity It is crucial to ensure that the CSF is free of blood during barbotage (aspirating CSF into a syringe) before administering spinal anaesthesia. In Obstetric use, very dilute concentrations of Bupivacaine are often combined with fentanyl for labour analgesia and postoperative pain management. Ropivacaine (Option A) is also a long-acting local anaesthetic that has a lower risk of cardiovascular toxicity and severe central nervous system effects compared to bupivacaine. Both can cause transient neurologic symptoms and injection site reactions, but ropivacaine is generally safer for obstetric and outpatient procedures. Lidocaine (Option B) is a widely used local anaesthetic with a rapid onset and moderate duration. While it can lead to cardiovascular effects at high doses, it is generally well-tolerated and not commonly associated with cardiac arrest in typical clinical use. Chloroprocaine (Option C) is an ultra-short-acting anaesthetic with a low risk of systemic toxicity. Its rapid metabolism and lower potency significantly decrease the likelihood of severe cardiovascular complications, including cardiac arrest. Previous formulations of chloroprocaine containing preservatives caused cauda equina syndrome when inadvertently injected in large volumes intrathecally.

      },
      "correct_answer": "D",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: D) Longer duration of anaesthesia Explanation: Epidural anaesthesia is a better option for the given condition, as it provides selective, segmental blockade of sympathetic fibres, preserves some sympathetic function, helps maintain vascular tone, and reduces the risk of hypotension. It also offers a longer duration of analgesia due to the larger volume of anaesthetic used and allows for continuous infusion.

      "correct_answer": "D",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: D) L3 - L4 Explanation: Spinal anaesthesia is ideally administered below the termination of the spinal cord, known as the conus medullaris, which typically ends at the L1 - L2 vertebral level in adults. Therefore, the preferred spaces for administering spinal anaesthesia in adults are between L2 and L3, L3 and L4, or L4 and L5. The L3 - L4 interspace is commonly chosen due to its accessibility and the presence of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). In infants, the preferred space for spinal anaesthesia is between L4 and L5, as their conus medullaris is situated lower in the vertebral column. The L4 - L5 space is easily identified by the intercristal line (Tuffier’s line), an imaginary line drawn between the highest points of the iliac crests, which typically corresponds to the L4 spinous process. Positioning for Spinal Anesthesia Spinal anaesthesia can be administered in two positions based on the patient's condition: Lateral decubitus position : Allows easier access to the lumbar interspaces and is often more comfortable. Sitting position: Facilitates the spread of the anaesthetic and is used when lateral positioning is not suitable.

Explanation: The type of needle used for the spinal injection does not have a significant impact on the level of anesthesia achieved but it may affect the risk of complications, such as post-dural puncture headache. Factors Affecting Level of Spinal Anesthesia Factors Effect Drug factors Dose Higher the dose, the higher the level of anaesthesia Baricity (Option A) Hypobaric drug floats in CSF, leading to a higher level of anaesthesia Hyperbaric drug settles down, resulting in a l ower level of anaesthesia. Patient factors CSF volume (Option B) Higher cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) volume dilutes the anaesthetic , reducing its spread and resulting in a lower level of spinal anaesthesia. Age (Option C) Advanced age is associated with ↓ CSF volume , leading to a higher level of spinal anaesthesia. Pregnancy Pregnancy increases intra-abdominal pressure , leading to a higher level of spinal anaesthesia due to enhanced cephalad spread of anaesthetic. Procedural factors Patient position In the sitting position, hyperbaric drugs settle lower in the spinal column, resulting in a lower level of anaesthesia. In the Trendelenburg position, hyperbaric drugs move cephalad (toward the neck), leading to a higher level of anaesthesia. Epidural Injection Post-Spinal Anesthesia It increases the level of anaesthesia by compressing the subarachnoid space and enhancing drug spread.

      "question": "A 30-year-old female undergoes spinal anaesthesia for a caesarean section. Twenty hours later, she develops a severe occipital headache that worsens when standing up and improves on lying down. Which of the following is the most definitive treatment for her condition?",

      },
      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: C) Epidural blood patch Explanation: The patient's symptoms are indicative of a post-dural puncture headache (PDPH ), which occurs due to a cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) leak following a puncture of the dura mater during procedures like spinal anaesthesia or epidural catheter placement. The onset is usually after 12-72 hours following the procedure and the pain is bilateral, frontal, retro orbital, or occipital and extends into the neck The most definitive treatment for PDPH is an epidural blood patch . Management of post-dural puncture headache (PDPH): Conservative management: A supine position (Option B) can help reduce the headache by decreasing the pressure gradient and allowing the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) to stabilize. Hydration ( (Option C) : Ensuring adequate fluid intake can help replenish lost CSF and alleviate symptoms. Oral caffeine (Option A) (500mg) can constrict blood vessels and increase CSF production, providing symptomatic relief. Analgesics such as acetaminophen or non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) like ibuprofen may help manage pain associated with PDPH. Definitive Management: An epidural blood patch is ideally performed 24 hours after the dural puncture. It involves injecting 15-20 mL of autologous blood into the epidural space to create a clot that seals the dural puncture, providing relief from the headache. If the first blood patch does not provide sufficient relief, a second epidural blood patch can be administered 24 to 48 hours later. Prevention: by using a smaller gauge needle (Pencil Point needles) for spinal procedures and minimizing the number of punctures. Ultrasound guidance for lumbar puncture.",

      "correct_answer": "D",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: D) Malignant Hyperthermia Explanation: Malignant Hyperthermia is more likely associated with general anaesthesia, not spinal anaesthesia. It is primarily triggered by volatile anaesthetics (like halothane, isoflurane, and sevoflurane) and the depolarising muscle relaxant (succinylcholine). It presents as tachypnea, tachycardia, muscle rigidity, hyperthermia, elevated blood pressure, and raised end-tidal CO2 levels. Transient Neurological Symptoms (Option A) typically occur after spinal anaesthesia, presenting as pain in the back radiating to the legs without any neurological deficits. Post-dural puncture headache (Option B) presents as a severe headache that occurs due to a CSF leak through the puncture in the dura mater following spinal anaesthesia. Respiratory Depression (Option C) occurs following a higher level of spinal anaesthesia or in patients with preexisting respiratory disease.

      "explanation": "Correct Answer: D) Ephedrine Explanation: Hypotension is the most commonest intraoperative complication of spinal anaesthesia due to, It can also happen due to adrenal gland blockage. Preloading with IV fluids , typically crystalloids , before spinal anaesthesia can help prevent Hypotension. If this occurs mid-surgery, the patient can initially be resuscitated with fluids; if the condition does not improve, it can be managed by Vasopressors like Phenylephrine (the drug of choice in Pregnancy) or Ephedrine. Ephedrine acts by increasing both cardiac output and systemic vascular resistance. Other intraoperative complications of Spinal anaesthesia are Bradycardia can be managed by Atropine (Option B) and shivering with Pethidine (Option C) . Respiratory distress can happen primarily due to total spinal anaesthesia (block of cervical and intracranial segment due to prolonged Trendelenburg position) leading to phrenic nerve paralysis or high spinal anaesthesia in which the block is achieved above the desired level. This should be managed by laryngoscopy and intubation . Apnea can happen more likely due to prolonged hypotension or medullary hypoperfusion than phrenic nerve paralysis. Cardiac arrest is a potential possibility preceded by hypotension and bradycardia, which can be avoided by appropriate treatment of such complications and immediate management by Adrenaline . Metoprolol (Option A) : Administering beta-blockers would worsen the hypotension , as it would further decrease cardiac contractility and slow the heart rate, which is contraindicated in hypotensive states caused by spinal anaesthesia.
