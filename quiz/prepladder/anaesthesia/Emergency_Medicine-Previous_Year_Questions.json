      "options": {
        "A": "Preoxygenation with 100% oxygen for 3 minutes is done",
        "B": "High–volume, low-pressure cuff is used",
        "C": "It is the first choice of treatment in cardiac arrest patients",
        "D": "The induction agent and muscle relaxant are given simultaneously"
      },
      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "intubation (RSI) is not typically performed in cardiac arrest because such patients are usually unconscious, eliminating the need for an induction agent. Instead, bag-mask ventilation and immediate advanced airway placement are prioritized. RSI is primarily used in patients who require airway protection but are at risk of aspiration, not in cardiac arrest situations. Preoxygenation with 100% oxygen for 3 minutes is done (Option A) : This is correct. Preoxygenation is critical to ensure oxygen reserves during the apneic period of intubation. High–volume, low-pressure cuff is used (Option B) : This is correct. Such cuffs minimize the risk of airway trauma and provide an effective seal. The induction agent and muscle relaxant are given simultaneously (Option D) : This is correct. Administering these agents together minimizes the time to achieve intubation readiness.

      "question": "An 18-year-old boy is rushed to the ER after having choked on a bone while eating. He is responsive but unable to speak. What is to be done next?",
      "options": {
        "A": "Bag and mask ventilation",
        "B": "Endoscopic removal",
        "C": "Deliver 5 back slaps and 5 chest compressions",
        "D": "Perform Heimlich maneuver"
      },
      "correct_answer": "D",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: D) Perform Heimlich maneuver Explanation: The patient is an adult who has choked on a bone while eating. The next best step is to perform the Heimlich maneuver by giving 5 abdominal thrusts. Heimlich Maneuver: The rescuer should stand or kneel behind the patient and wrap his arms around the patient's waist. With one hand, he makes a fist, and using the other hand, he drives the fist into the patient's abdomen with a rapid, forceful upward thrust to dislodge the foreign body. This is continued until the foreign body is expelled or if the patient becomes unresponsive. If the patient becomes unresponsive , immediately start CPR . Bag and mask ventilation (Option A): This intervention may be necessary if the patient becomes unresponsive and stops breathing, it is not the initial step in managing a conscious patient with an airway obstruction due to choking. Endoscopic removal(Option B): may be necessary if other methods fail or if the obstruction is not cleared by basic interventions, it may not be the initial step in managing a conscious patient with a clear airway obstruction. Deliver 5 back slaps and 5 chest compressions (Option C): This is done in the case of an infant and not an adult. Reference: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK531467/",

      "explanation": "to include items such as endotracheal tubes, laryngoscopes, stylets, oral airways, suction catheters, and other devices used for airway assessment and intervention. These strongly suggest that the instruments are used for airway management. Airway management involves various techniques and tools to establish and maintain a patient's airway, ensuring adequate oxygenation and ventilation. Macintosh Laryngoscope Miller Laryngoscope McCoy Laryngoscope Blade Curved shape Straight shape Curved with levering tip Use In adults In children (large epiglottis) It can be used for both adults and children. Nasopharyngeal airway Guendel airway (Oropharyngeal) Placed through nose Placed through mouth Prevents back falling of tongue Prevents back falling of tongue Size is calculated by distance between tip of the nose and tragus Size is calculated by distance between angle of mouth and tragus Contraindicated in skull fracture and bleeding disorders Contraindicated in absence of gag reflex Central line insertion (Option A): I t refers to the placement of a catheter into a large central vein, such as the subclavian vein or internal jugular vein. The instruments used for this procedure typically include a needle, guidewire, dilators, and catheterization kit. The image provided does not correspond to instruments commonly used for central line insertion. Arterial line insertion (Option B): Arterial line insertion involves the placement of an arterial catheter to monitor blood pressure continuously and obtain arterial blood samples. The instruments used for arterial line insertion include a needle, guidewire, dilators, and arterial catheterization kit. The image does not match the instruments commonly used for arterial line insertion. Umbilical catheter insertion (Options D): Umbilical catheter insertion refers to the placement of a catheter into the umbilical artery or vein in newborns for medical purposes. The instruments used for this procedure typically include umbilical catheters, catheterization tray, and securing devices.
