      "explanation": "Correct answer: A) Continue ventilation Explanation: Panretinal photocoagulation done for Diabetic retinopathy is a type of photocoagulation laser . Laser beams used in surgery may cause ignition of tissues and equipment in the presence of combustible gasses such as oxygen and nitrous oxide. During such airway fires, ventilation should be stopped immediately and the tubings should be removed and extinguished with water . Prophylactic measures: Use of nitrous oxide in laser surgery is contraindicated. Preferred alternative: Heliox. Endotracheal tubes made up of stainless steel or aluminum are preferred during laser surgery. Proper training given to theater staff regarding the airway fire drill. Management of airway fire:",

      },
      "correct_answer": "D",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: D) 23L CO2 per 100 gram Explanation: Soda lime absorbs up to 23 L of CO I per 100 g of absorbent Soda lime: Function Removes carbon dioxide through an exothermic reaction in a closed breathing circuit Composition Sodium hydroxide Calcium hydroxide Potassium hydroxide Water Granule size 4 to 8 mesh size Absorption capacity Soda lime absorbs up to 23 L of CO I per 100 g of absorbent. Chemical Process Sodium and potassium hydroxide neutralize and trap carbon dioxide. Gaseous carbon dioxide is converted into solid calcium carbonate (chalk). By-products Heat and water are produced during the reaction. Helps maintain the temperature and humidity of the anesthesia circuit. Indicator A dye (e.g., ethyl violet) changes color from white to purple with increasing hydrogen ion concentration and absorbent exhaustion. Reaction with anesthetics Dry soda lime can degrade volatile anesthetics (e.g., desflurane, sevoflurane) and produce carbon monoxide. Carbon monoxide formation is greatest with desflurane.

      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "patient Correct Answer: C) APL valve is closed and the fresh gas flow is set equal to the uptake by the patient Explanation: Circle system - closed breathing system Components Fresh gas inlet Reservoir bag Two one-way valves (inspiratory and expiratory limbs) Y-piece connector to the patient APL valve Soda lime canister for CO2 absorption Kink-resistant corrugated tubing connecting components and patient Fully closed system To make the circle system a fully closed system - the APL valve is closed and the fresh gas flow is set equal to the uptake by the patient so that the overall volume of gas in the system is constant. It is difficult to estimate the patient’s oxygen uptake accurately and therefore fully closed systems are rarely used in practice. Advantages Conserves anesthetic gases, heat, and moisture. Allows low-flow anesthesia with monitoring. Low dead space; Y-piece tubing creates mechanical dead space comparable to non-rebreathing circuits. Soda lime canister is distant from the patient’s airway, reducing the inhalation risk of soda lime dust. Reduces atmospheric pollution by recycling anesthetic gases.",
