      "question": "A female following an RTA injured her chest. On X-ray, fracture of 3rd to 5th ribs was noted. Pain was not responsive to analgesics. Which block will be given to reduce the pain?",
      "options": {
        "A": "Cervical block",
        "B": "Thoracic epidural block",
        "C": "Supra-clavicular block",
        "D": "Lumbar epidural block"
      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: B) Thoracic epidural block Explanation: Pain Origin: The patient has rib fractures (3rd to 5th ribs), leading to severe pain that is not relieved by analgesics . Best Pain Management: A thoracic epidural block provides excellent analgesia for rib fractures by blocking intercostal nerves at multiple levels. Mechanism: It involves injecting local anesthetics and opioids into the thoracic epidural space , leading to segmental pain relief without systemic opioid side effects. Indications: Used for rib fractures, thoracic surgeries, and trauma-related pain management. Thoracic Epidural Block in Rib Fractures Feature Details Indication Rib fractures, thoracic surgeries, trauma pain Mechanism Blocks intercostal nerves via epidural space Level of Block Usually T4-T8 , depending on rib injury Drugs Used Local anesthetics (e.g., bupivacaine) + opioids (e.g., fentanyl) Advantages Superior pain control, reduces respiratory complications, prevents opioid overuse Complications Hypotension, motor blockade, infection (rare) Cervical block (Option A): Incorrect because cervical plexus blocks are used for neck surgeries, not rib fractures. Supra-clavicular block (Option C): Incorrect because it targets the brachial plexus and is used for upper limb anesthesia, not chest pain. Lumbar epidural block (Option D): Incorrect because lumbar epidurals are used for lower body surgeries and labor analgesia, not rib fractures.

      "question": "Which of the following is most suitable for intravenous regional anesthesia?",
      "options": {
        "A": "Bupivacaine",
        "B": "Mepivacaine",
        "C": "Procaine",
        "D": "Lidocaine"
      },
      "correct_answer": "D",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: D) Lidocaine Explanation: The most suitable local anesthetic for intravenous regional anesthesia (IVRA), commonly known as Bier's block , is Lidocaine. Intravenous regional anesthesia (IVRA): Indications Suitable for minor surgical procedures on the upper or lower extremities (hand surgeries, forearm procedures, and foot surgeries). Used when general anesthesia is not necessary and for patients with contraindications to other forms of anesthesia. Anesthetic Agents Commonly used local anesthetics include Lidocaine (most frequent) Prilocaine Procedure Steps Tourniquet Application: Apply a tourniquet to the proximal part of the extremity to prevent blood flow and keep the local anesthetic localized. Venous Access: Establish intravenous access in the selected limb. Administration of Anesthetic agent: Inject the local anesthetic into the IV line, typically in a volume of 40-50 mL. Tourniquet Management The tourniquet should be inflated to a pressure that is approximately 50 mmHg above systolic blood pressure. It is typically safe to keep the tourniquet inflated for 30-60 minutes; prolonged inflation can increase the risk of complications. Advantages Provides effective analgesia with minimal systemic absorption. Allows for a bloodless surgical field. Quick onset of action and ease of administration. Disadvantages and Complications Local Anesthetic Systemic Toxicity (LAST) Can occur if the local anesthetic enters the systemic circulation. Tourniquet Pain Nerve Damage Contraindications Infection at the injection site or over the tourniquet. Severe peripheral vascular disease. Patient refusal or inability to cooperate. Lipid Emulsion Therapy Used as a treatment for Local anesthesia systemic toxicity, acts by sequestering the local anesthetic from circulation and mitigating toxic effects. Administer a 20% lipid emulsion intravenously if toxicity occurs. Bupivacaine (Option A): is the most cardiotoxic drug and it should never be administered intravenously. Mepivacaine (Option B): has the same anesthetic potency as lidocaine but also has a milder dilating ability, leading to a longer duration of anesthesia without a vasoconstrictor. Procaine (Option C): can be used as an alternative if allergic to lignocaine. It can cause methemoglobinemia.",

      "question": "Which drug is most likely responsible for the occurrence of hyperthermia and muscle rigidity in a patient undergoing surgery while being administered anesthesia with halothane?",
      "options": {
        "A": "D-curare",
        "B": "Suxamethonium",
        "C": "Cis-atracurium",
        "D": "Rocuronium"
      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "muscle relaxant can trigger malignant hyperthermia (MH) in genetically susceptible individuals, especially when used with volatile anesthetics like halothane. MH is characterized by hyperthermia, muscle rigidity, hypercapnia, and tachycardia due to excessive calcium release in skeletal muscle. Malignant hyperthermia is a rare but life-threatening condition triggered by drugs like succinylcholine and volatile anesthetics (e.g., halothane), requiring prompt treatment with dantrolene to prevent fatal outcomes. Incorrect Options: D-curare (Option A) : A non-depolarizing muscle relaxant, but it is not associated with triggering malignant hyperthermia. Cis-atracurium (Option C) : A non-depolarizing agent with minimal side effects and no association with MH. Rocuronium (Option D) : Another non-depolarizing muscle relaxant not linked to malignant hyperthermia. Reference: Morgan and Mikhail’s Clinical Anesthesiology, Edition 5, Pg 1185- 1188",

      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "pierced during a lumbar puncture before the needle enters the lumbar cistern, where cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) is present. During a lumbar puncture, the sequence of structures pierced includes skin → subcutaneous tissue → supraspinous ligament → interspinous ligament → ligamentum flavum → dura mater → arachnoid membrane. The needle stops in the lumbar cistern, which lies between the arachnoid membrane and pia mater. Incorrect Options: Ligamentum flavum (Option A) : This is pierced earlier, just after passing through the skin, subcutaneous tissue, and supraspinous and interspinous ligaments. Dura mater (Option B) : This tough, outer meningeal layer is pierced before the arachnoid membrane. Pia mater (Option D) : This innermost meningeal layer closely adheres to the spinal cord and is not pierced during a lumbar puncture unless there is accidental trauma.

      },
      "correct_answer": "D",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: D) Wait and watch and give supplementary oxygen if needed Explanation: Given that the patient is asymptomatic and resting comfortably , the most appropriate course of action is close observation . This approach ensures that any changes in the patient's condition are promptly identified. If the patient develops any signs of respiratory distress or hypoxia , supplementary oxygen can be administered as necessary. Key points: The patient’s asymptomatic status suggests that immediate intervention is not required. Close monitoring helps detect any subtle signs of complications such as pneumothorax or diaphragmatic paralysis . Supplementary oxygen can be provided if respiratory symptoms emerge, ensuring optimal management in case the patient becomes symptomatic.

Pain management (e.g., labour analgesia). Key features of the Tuohy needle: Blunt curved tip : Minimises the risk of puncturing the dura. Epidural markings : Assist in depth estimation during insertion. Side hole (lateral aperture) : Allows the passage of an epidural catheter. Incorrect Options: Whitacre needle (option A): This is a pencil-point needle used for spinal anaesthesia. It has a non-cutting tip to reduce the risk of post-dural puncture headache. Sprotte needle (option B): Another pencil-point needle designed for spinal anaesthesia with a longer side hole for smooth cerebrospinal fluid flow. Quincke-Babcock needle (option D): A cutting-tip needle used for spinal anaesthesia. It creates a sharp puncture, which increases the risk of post-dural puncture headache compared to pencil-point needles. Reference: Morgan and Mikhail’s Clinical Anaesthesia, 5th Edition, Page 955",
