      "correct_answer": "D",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: D) The absolute contraindication for local anesthesia is an allergy to the anesthetic. Local anesthesia is a safe, effective pain management method. Works by reversibly binding sodium channels, blocking sodium entry, and inhibiting nerve impulse propagation. (Option B ruled out) Two classes of local anesthetics: Amides : Lidocaine, prilocaine, mepivacaine, bupivacaine. Esters . Widely used in dentistry for pain control. Absolute contraindication: Allergy to anesthetics. (Option D) Spinal anesthesia Spinal anesthesia is a neuraxial technique where local anesthetic is injected into the intrathecal (subarachnoid) space. Commonly used for surgeries below the umbilicus , including lower abdomen, pelvis, perineal, and lower extremities. (Option C ruled out) Performed with the patient in sitting or lateral decubitus position. Absolute contraindications: Lack of patient consent, elevated intracranial pressure (ICP). Relative contraindications: Neurological diseases, severe dehydration (hypovolemia), thrombocytopenia/coagulopathy, severe mitral/aortic stenosis, left ventricular outflow obstruction (e.g., hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy).. Epidural Anesthesia Epidural anesthesia involves injecting anesthetic into the epidural space to block sensory and motor spinal nerve roots. (Option A ruled out) Covers areas like the thoracic, abdominal, pelvic, and lower extremities. Also used as adjunct pain management intraoperatively or postoperatively. Advantage : Flexible dosing and administration (intermittent or continuous infusion) to fit clinical needs. Primary indications: Obstetric anesthesia during labor, surgical anesthesia for thoracic, major intra-abdominal, or spine surgeries that do not require muscle relaxation. Absolute contraindications: Patient refusal, local infection at puncture site, increased intracranial pressure, traumatic spinal cord injury. Relative contraindications: Hemodynamic instability, obstructive cardiomyopathy, coagulopathy or therapeutic anticoagulation, thrombocytopenia, difficulty maintaining position for epidural placement, spinal abnormalities. Nerve block Peripheral nerve blocks inhibit distal nerve impulse transmission, stopping pain signals to the cortex. Uses : Acute pain management (e.g., procedural anesthesia, perioperative analgesia), diagnosing and treating chronic pain. Complications : Nerve injury, infection at catheter site, bleeding, local anesthetic systemic toxicity (LAST).",

      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: A) 3 cm or less Explanation: Inter-incisor distance refers to the distance between the upper and lower incisors when the mouth is maximally opened. Measurement It is typically measured in centimeters or millimeters using a ruler or caliper. Normal Range The average interincisor distance for adults is usually around 4-5 cm (40-50 mm). Significance in Intubation An interincisor distance of less than 3 cm (2 fingerbreadths) is often considered a potential indicator of difficult intubation. A reduced distance may suggest restricted jaw mobility, making it harder to access the airway. Related Conditions Conditions such as temporomandibular joint dysfunction (TMD), jaw trauma, or other musculoskeletal issues can result in a reduced interincisor distance. Clinical Relevance An adequate inter-incisor distance is crucial for proper airway management, where intubation may be required.",

      },
      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: C) Neck fully extended, mouth closed Explanation: The head should be in full extension with the mouth closed to get an accurate measurement of the sternomental distance. Thyromental Distance Sternomental Distance The straight line distance from the thyroid notch (Adam's apple) to the lower border of mentum (tip of the chin). The straight line distance between the manubrium sterni and bony point of mentum. A normal thyromental distance is typically greater than 6.5cm. A distance of less than 6.5 cm is often considered a predictor of difficult intubation. A normal sternomental distance is generally greater than 12.5-13.5 cm. A distance of less than 12 cm is associated with difficult airway management. Measured with the patient's neck fully extended, mouth closed , and head in a neutral position. Can be measured using a ruler or tape. Measured with the patient's neck fully extended, mouth closed , and head tilted back. A measuring tape or ruler is used to assess the distance. A shorter thyromental distance (<6.5 cm) may indicate limited mandibular space and suggest that the intubation could be difficult. A shorter sternomental distance suggests limited head and neck mobility, potentially indicating difficult intubation. Commonly used as part of a pre-anesthetic airway assessment. This measurement helps in predicting airway management challenges, particularly in patients with restricted neck movement or short necks.",

        "D": "The child is allowed clear liquids until 4 hours prior to the surgery."
      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "undergoing anesthesia. Correct Answer: B) The child should wait at least 4 hours from the last breast milk feed before undergoing anesthesia. Explanation: The recommended fasting period after breast milk consumption is 4 hours before anesthesia. Fasting Guidelines in Children and Adults Children Clear Liquids Fasting period 2 hours before anesthesia. Clear liquids include water, clear juices (without pulp), and clear broths. Breast Milk Fasting period 4 hours before anesthesia. Breast milk is digested more quickly than formula or solid foods. Infant Formula Fasting period 6 hours before anesthesia. Formula is heavier and takes longer to digest than breast milk. Non-Human Milk Fasting period 6 hours before anesthesia. Includes cow’s milk and soy milk, which are digested similarly to solid foods. Light Meal Fasting period 6 hours before anesthesia. A light meal may include toast and clear liquids but should avoid heavy, fatty, or fried foods. Solid Foods Fasting period 8 hours or more before anesthesia. This applies to a full meal, especially one containing fatty or fried foods that take longer to digest. Adults Clear Liquids Fasting period 2 hours before anesthesia. Clear liquids include water, tea, black coffee (no milk), and clear juices. Light Meal Fasting period 6 hours before anesthesia. A light meal consists of foods like toast or non-fatty snacks. Avoid heavy foods or meals rich in protein and fat. Solid Food Fasting period 8 hours or more before anesthesia. Clinical Importance of Fasting: Aspiration Prevention: Fasting reduces the risk of aspiration during anesthesia, where stomach contents may enter the lungs, leading to serious complications. Safe Induction of Anesthesia : Ensuring an empty stomach allows for safer airway management and anesthesia administration. Reference: Miller's Anesthesia, 9th Edition, Page 1381",

      "correct_answer": "D",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: D) Patient after Nissen fundoplication surgery Explanation: Nissen fundoplication surgery: This procedure reinforces the lower esophageal sphincter (LES), reducing or eliminating gastroesophageal reflux, and thus lowering the risk of aspiration. Conditions at High Risk of Aspiration Despite Fasting Neurological Disorders Cerebral Palsy (Option B): Impaired motor function affects swallowing coordination. Stroke : Can lead to dysphagia and loss of protective airway reflexes. Multiple Sclerosis (Option C): Neuromuscular impairment affecting swallowing ability. Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS) : Progressive muscle weakness and dysphagia. Neuromuscular Disorders Myasthenia Gravis or Muscular Dystrophy Gastroesophageal Reflux Disease (GERD) Increased Risk of Reflux: Even during fasting, individuals with GERD can experience reflux, which may lead to aspiration. Obesity Increased Abdominal Pressure: Can contribute to gastroesophageal reflux, particularly when lying flat. Hiatal Hernia (Option 1) Exacerbate gastroesophageal reflux, increasing the potential for aspiration, especially when lying down. Pregnancy Hormonal Changes and Increased Abdominal Pressure: As the pregnancy progresses, these factors can increase the risk of reflux, leading to aspiration, especially in the third trimester. Diabetes Mellitus with Gastroparesis Delayed Gastric Emptying: Gastroparesis can lead to increased risk of reflux due to prolonged retention of food in the stomach. Elderly Population Age-Related Changes: Result in decreased swallowing efficiency and increased susceptibility to aspiration. Reference: Miller’s Anesthesia, 9th Edition, Page 1381",

      },
      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: A) 2-5 days Explanation: Warfarin should be stopped 5 days before elective surgery to allow INR to fall below 1.5, minimising bleeding risk. INR is reassessed before surgery to ensure it is safe to proceed. Bridging anticoagulation (e.g., with LMWH) is considered for patients at high thromboembolic risk. Medication Continue or stop preoperatively Oral Anticoagulants Stop 2-5 days prior to noncardiac surgery Continue in high-patient risk (e.g., high-risk mechanical valves) Aspirin Low-dose aspirin (75–100 mg/day) : Often continued perioperatively in patients with high cardiovascular risk (e.g., recent stent). High-dose aspirin (>300 mg/day) : Typically stopped 7–10 days prior to surgery due to higher bleeding risk. Decision to continue or stop aspirin depends on bleeding risk of surgery vs thrombotic risk of the patient. Statins Continue Thienopyridines (e.g., Clopidogrel) Discontinue 2 weeks before surgery Note: Incase of a patient with coronary stent: Aspirin should be continued P2Y12 Inhibitors (e.g., clopidogrel, ticagrelor, prasugrel) should be discontinued 1 day (Option B) : IToo short. INR would still be elevated, increasing bleeding risk. 7 days (Option C) : Longer than needed in most cases; not routinely necessary. 10 days (Option D) : Excessively long and may unnecessarily increase thrombotic risk.
