      "question": "A 30-year-old man is found unconscious after a motorcycle accident. There are no signs of external bleeding, but you suspect a possible head or neck injury. You need to open his airway to check for breathing. What is the preferred method for opening the airway in this situation?",
      "options": {
        "A": "Head tilt-chin lift",
        "B": "Jaw thrust",
        "C": "Head tilt-neck lift",
        "D": "Avoid opening the airway"
      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: B) Jaw thrust Explanation: In cases of suspected head or neck trauma, the jaw thrust manoeuvre is preferred to open the airway while minimizing neck movement, reducing the risk of exacerbating spinal injuries. The CAB algorithm highlights the key elements needed to ensure high-quality CPR in BLS. Compressions (C) Position: Place the patient in a supine position on a firm surface. Site: Lower I rd of sternum Rate: 100 to 120 compressions per minute. Depth: Compress 2 to 2.4 inches (5-6 cm); avoid exceeding 2.4 inches. Compression-to-Ventilation Ratio: 30 compressions to 2 breaths (30:2). Chest Recoil: Allow full recoil between compressions to optimize blood flow. Interruptions: Minimize interruptions in compressions ( <10 seconds ). Chest Compression Fraction (CCF): The proportion of time spent performing chest compressions during CPR: Maintain a CCF ≥ 60%. For pregnant women: perform manual lateral uterine displacement (LUD) to relieve pressure on large abdominal vessels. Airway (A) Head Tilt-Chin Lift: Used to open the airway in patients without suspected neck trauma. Jaw Thrust: Preferred method, if neck trauma is suspected. The most common cause of airway obstruction in unconscious patients is the tongue falling back. Breathing (B) Rescue Breaths: Give 2 breaths after every 30 compressions. Method: Mouth-to-mouth or with a bag-mask device, ensuring chest rise with each breath. Breath Duration: Each breath should last about 1 second. Head Tilt Chin Lift Maneuver: The head is tilted back while lifting the chin upwards to prevent the tongue from obstructing the airway. Used to open the airway in an unconscious patient without suspected spinal injury. Jaw Thrust Maneuver: The lower jaw is lifted forward by placing fingers behind the angle of the mandible, moving the tongue forward and clearing the airway without moving the neck. Used to open the airway in patients with suspected cervical spine injury.",

Automated External Defibrillator (AED) An Automated External Defibrillator (AED) is a portable, computerized device designed to identify life-threatening cardiac arrhythmias and, if necessary, deliver an electrical shock to restore a normal heart rhythm. It is an automated , user-friendly device for layperson use, while a conventional defibrillator requires professional expertise for manual operation and rhythm interpretation.

      },
      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: A) Defibrillation after the conversion to a shockable rhythm Explanation: Initially, the patient is in asystole, a non-shockable rhythm , and later converts to ventricular fibrillation, a shockable rhythm . Once the patient converts from a non-shockable to a shockable rhythm, defibrillation is the most effective intervention. Shockable vs Non-Shockable Rhythm definitions Shockable Rhythms : Ventricular Fibrillation (VF) Pulseless Ventricular Tachycardia (pVT) Respond to defibrillation. Non-Shockable Rhythms : Asystole Pulseless Electrical Activity (PEA) Do not respond to defibrillation. Prognostic Implications Survival Rates : Shockable rhythms have better survival and neurological outcomes compared to non-shockable rhythms . Conversion from Non-Shockable to Shockable : Early conversion improves outcomes, enhancing survival rates and neurological recovery. Factors Influencing Rhythm Type Factor Non-Shockable Rhythms Shockable Rhythms Demographics Female, older age, unwitnessed arrests - Medical History Non-cardiovascular diseases (e.g., COPD), medications (antidepressants, antipsychotics) History of cardiovascular disease Administration of high-dose epinephrine (Option B) is not standard and may not significantly improve survival compared to defibrillation in shockable rhythms. Immediate initiation of therapeutic hypothermia (Option C) is used post-resuscitation for neuroprotection but does not address the immediate need for defibrillation. Continuous chest compressions without defibrillation (Option D) would delay the critical intervention for a shockable rhythm, reducing survival chances.

      "explanation": "clinical judgement. Correct Answer: B) Manual defibrillators can allows the users to adjust energy levels based on their clinical judgement Explanation: One of the key advantages of manual defibrillators is the ability to synchronize shocks with the patient's heartbeat. Uses of Manual Defibrillators Manual defibrillators are crucial for treating cardiac arrest caused by ventricular fibrillation (VF) or pulseless ventricular tachycardia (VT) by delivering controlled electric shocks to restore normal heart rhythm. Uses Use Details Termination of VF and Pulseless VT Treats life-threatening arrhythmias, the leading causes of sudden cardiac arrest. Stops chaotic electrical activity, allowing heart reset. Early Defibrillation in Cardiac Arrest Critical for survival; chances decrease 7-10% each minute without defibrillation. Timely shocks significantly enhance resuscitation success. Differentiation from AEDs AEDs are for bystanders; manual defibrillators are used by healthcare professionals in clinical settings. Offer advanced features like energy adjustment.

      "question": "A 54-year-old woman presents to the emergency department with palpitations, dizziness, and mild shortness of breath. Her vital signs are heart rate of 150 bpm, blood pressure of 124/80 mmHg, and oxygen saturation of 95% on room air. The rhythm strip of the ECG is shown below. Vagal maneuvers are attempted without success. You decide to administer adenosine. Which of the following is the most appropriate initial dose of adenosine, and what is the mechanism of its action?",
      "options": {
        "A": "6 mg IV push, briefly depresses sinus node and AV node conduction",
        "B": "12 mg IV push, briefly depresses sinus node and AV node conduction",
        "C": "6 mg IV push, increases AV node conduction and depresses sinus node",
        "D": "12 mg IV push, decreases AV node conduction and increases sinus node rate"
      },
      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: A) 6 mg IV push, briefly depresses sinus node and AV node conduction consistent with supraventricular tachycardia (SVT). Adenosine is an endogenous purine nucleoside that temporarily depresses the sinus node and AV node function, essential in treating regular, narrow-complex tachycardias like SVT. The initial dose of 6 mg IV should be administered rapidly, followed by a 20 mL saline flush. Adenosine Mechanism of action: Endogenous purine nucleoside Briefly depresses sinus node rate and AV node conduction Vasodilator Half-life: 10-30s Indication: Narrow-complex tachycardia: Stable, regular tachycardias Unstable, regular tachycardias while preparing for electrical cardioversion Wide-complex tachycardia: Stable, regular, monomorphic, as a therapeutic and diagnostic maneuver Dosage: 6 mg IV as a rapid push followed by a 20 mL saline flush Repeat if required as 12 mg IV push Side effects: Hypotension Bronchospasm Chest discomfort Reference: Miller's Anesthesia, 9th Edition, Page 2729 https://www.ahajournals.org/doi/pdf/10.1161/01.CIR.82.5.1854",
