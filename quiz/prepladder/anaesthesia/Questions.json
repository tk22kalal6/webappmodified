      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: B) Propofol Propofol is the preferred choice for daycare surgery and Total Intravenous Anesthesia (TIVA) due to its rapid onset and quick recovery profile. Additionally, Propofol is associated with a lower incidence of postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV) Propofol Appearance: Clear, white emulsion, available as a 1% aqueous preparation (10 mg/mL) for IV administration. Composition of Propofol Chemical structure: phenol ring with two isopropyl groups . Solubility: not water-soluble; available as a 1% aqueous oil-in-water emulsion. Emulsion ingredients: contains soybean oil, glycerol, and egg lecithin. Storage requirements: this should be administered within 6 hours of opening due to the risk of bacterial contamination, and a strict sterile technique is required 0.005% disodium edetate or 0.025% sodium metabisulfite helps slow bacterial growth. Pharmacokinetics of Propofol Administration Route: only available for intravenous use. Onset of Action: rapid onset ; effects typically observed for 2–8 minutes after administration. Distribution: short initial distribution half-life leads to quick awakening . Recovery: faster recovery compared to other anesthetics, minimal \"hangover\" effects . Biotransformation: high clearance exceeding hepatic blood flow (possible extrahepatic metabolism); metabolism occurs in the liver, resulting in inactive metabolites. Excretion : Primarily eliminated via urine; unaffected by end-stage kidney disease . Clinical Uses Induction of Anesthesia : Suitable for patients aged 3 years and older ; can be used in younger children with IV access. Maintenance of Anesthesia : For patients over 2 months old. Sedation : During monitored anesthesia for various procedures. For intubated, mechanically ventilated ICU patients. Off-Label Uses Management of refractory status epilepticus in both children and adults. Treatment of refractory postoperative nausea and vomiting. Incorrect Options: Options A, C and D are less commonly chosen for daycare surgeries Reference: Morgan and Mikhail’s Clinical Anesthesiology, 7th edition, Pg: 338-341 https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK430884/",

        "A": "Ketamine",
        "B": "Propofol",
        "C": "Thiopentone sodium",
        "D": "Midazolam"
      },
      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "antagonist. Mechanism of Action: Inhibits N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor (NMDA) receptors (Option A) , affecting the CNS. Induces dissociative anesthesia , making patients appear conscious but unable to process sensory input. Influences endogenous analgesic pathways. High lipid solubility (5 to 10 times that of thiopental) and low protein binding (12%). S(+) isomer (Ketanest) is 3 to 4 times more potent as an analgesic with fewer psychomimetic effects. S(+) ketamine causes cognitive impairment and reduced reaction time despite its analgesic properties. S(+) isomer has higher NMDA affinity and potency. Pharmacokinetics Absorption: Primarily given intravenously or intramuscularly; peak levels in 10-15 minutes. Distribution: Highly lipid-soluble; rapid brain uptake with a 10-15 minute distribution half-life. Biotransformation: Metabolized in the liver to active metabolites; tolerance develops with repeated use. Excretion: Renally excreted ; elimination half-life of about 2 hours. Incorrect Options: Propofol and Thiopentone (Options B and C) are direct GABA-A receptor agonists that enhance GABA’s effects. Midazolam (Options D) is a benzodiazepine , increases GABA's effect by modifying the receptor to make it more responsive to GABA. Reference: Miller's Anesthesia 9th Edition Pg no. 664-666",

      "question": "Intravenous induction agent of choice for day care anesthesia is?",
      "options": {
        "A": "Ketamine",
        "B": "Propofol",
        "C": "Etomidate",
        "D": "Thiopentone"
      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: B) Propofol Explanation: Propofol is the intravenous induction agent of choice for day-care anaesthesia due to its rapid onset, antiemetic effects, short duration of action, and smooth recovery profile. It allows patients to wake up quickly with minimal residual sedation, which is ideal for day-care procedures requiring early discharge. Incorrect Options: Ketamine (option A): While ketamine provides excellent analgesia and maintains cardiovascular stability, it is associated with slower recovery and potential emergence reactions (e.g., hallucinations). These side effects make it less suitable for day-care anaesthesia. Etomidate (option C) has a rapid onset and is haemodynamically stable, but it is associated with adrenal suppression and myoclonus, making it less ideal for routine day-care procedures. Thiopentone (option D) has a rapid onset, but its prolonged recovery time due to accumulation in body fat makes it unsuitable for day-care anaesthesia. It also lacks antiemetic properties, which are beneficial in outpatient settings. Reference: Morgan and Mikhail’s Clinical Anaesthesia, 7th Edition, Page 175, 213, 479",

      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "Incorrect Options: Options B, C and D are incorrect. Propofol, Thiopentone, Ketamine are known to cause myocardial depression to varying degrees as part of their pharmacological effects. (all 3 act on GABA receptors) Option B - Propofol: Propofol has a dose-dependent depressant effect on myocardial contractility and can also cause peripheral vasodilation, leading to decreased preload and afterload on the heart. Additionally, propofol can directly inhibit cardiac contractility by affecting intracellular calcium handling and reducing calcium release from the sarcoplasmic reticulum. Option C - Thiopentone: Thiopentone decreases systemic vascular resistance, which can lead to reduced preload and afterload on the heart. Additionally, it can directly depress myocardial contractility by reducing the sensitivity of cardiac myofilaments to calcium, impairing excitation-contraction coupling. Option D - Ketamine : ↑ HR, ↑ BP, ↑ CO, Myocardial O2 Consumption Reference: Morgan & Mikhail's Clinical Anesthesiology",

      "explanation": "analgesic effects. It has a less painful injection compared to other intravenous agents. Option B: Propofol Propofol is associated with pain on injection. It can cause a burning or stinging sensation at the injection site. To mitigate this, propofol is often mixed with lidocaine or administered through a larger vein or with the use of a local anesthetic block. Option C: Etomidate Etomidate is also associated with pain on injection. It can cause discomfort and burning at the injection site. Similar to propofol, methods like dilution, premedication with lidocaine, or administration through larger veins can reduce the pain. Option D: Thiopentone Thiopentone can cause pain on injection. It is a barbiturate anesthetic and may lead to a burning or stinging sensation at the injection site. Techniques such as dilution or premedication with lidocaine may be employed to minimize the pain.

      "explanation": "it further increases the intracranial pressure. It masks the useful diagnostic & prognostic signs. The effects of morphine such as respiratory depression, miosis & mental clouding also interfere with the diagnosis. Incorrect Options: Option A - Bronchial asthma: Bronchial asthma is not an absolute contraindication to the use of morphine. However, caution should be exercised because morphine can cause respiratory depression and may exacerbate bronchospasm in susceptible individuals. If necessary, alternative analgesic options may be considered for patients with severe bronchial asthma or a known hypersensitivity to opioids. Option B - Renal failure: Renal failure is not a contraindication to the use of morphine. However, in patients with renal impairment or end-stage renal disease, dosage adjustments may be necessary due to the potential for accumulation of morphine and its metabolites. Close monitoring of renal function and titration of the dose are recommended in such cases. Option C - Emphysema: Emphysema is not a contraindication to the use of morphine. However, caution should be exercised because morphine can depress the respiratory drive and may worsen respiratory function in patients with severe emphysema. Adjustments to the dosage or consideration of alternative analgesics may be necessary in these situations. Reference: Morgan & Mikhail's Clinical Anesthesiology",

      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "with high vapor pressure (681 mm Hg at 20°C) and very low blood solubility ( λ b/g 0.42), allowing rapid induction and emergence. It requires a special vaporizer (tec 6) for precise anesthetic control. Tec 6 Blood gas coefficient indicates speed of onset and recovery, solubility of inhalational agent in the blood. It is inversely proportional to speed of onset High B/G has a slow onset Low B/G has a fast onset Desflurane has similar blood-gas partition co-efficient similar to Nitrous oxide. Uses Desflurane is ideal for rapid induction and emergence due to its low blood solubility, but it is not suitable for inhalation induction due to its pungency and airway irritation. C/I It should be avoided in patients with severe hypovolemia, malignant hyperthermia, and intracranial hypertension. Systemic Effects Cardiovascular Desflurane decreases systemic vascular resistance and arterial blood pressure. It causes moderate increases in heart rate, central venous pressure, and pulmonary artery pressure, particularly during rapid concentration increases, which can be managed with fentanyl, esmolol, or clonidine. Respiratory Causes decreased tidal volume and increased respiratory rate. It is pungent and can cause airway irritation, making it unsuitable for inhalation induction. Hepatic Minimal metabolism and risk of anesthetic-induced hepatitis, with maintained hepatic oxygen delivery. Renal Minimal nephrotoxicity, but decreases in urine output and glomerular filtration occur with reduced cardiac output. Neuromuscular Desflurane causes a dose-dependent decrease in neuromuscular response, enhancing the effects of nondepolarizing neuromuscular blockers. Cerebral Increases cerebral blood flow (CBF), intracranial pressure, and cerebral blood volume but decreases cerebral oxygen consumption. CBF can be lowered through hyperventilation. Incorrect Options: Other incorrect options do not have blood gas partition co-efficient similar to nitrous oxide. Isoflurane (Option A) : Most commonly used in CVS and CNS surgeries Cost-effective Sevoflurane (Option C) : Induction agent of choice in children Second fastest-acting inhalational agent Halothane (Option D): Undergoes maximum metabolism in liver (20%) Most hepatotoxic- can cause halothane-induced hepatitis if given repeatedly",

      "explanation": "Correct Answer: B) Calcium Explanation: The above patient presents with rigidity and hyperthermia after administration of halothane. This is indicative towards the diagnosis of malignant hyperthermia and the ion involved is calcium . It occurs due to prolonged opening of functionally altered ryanodine receptors , leading to uncontrolled release of calcium from sarcoplasmic reticulum causing sustained muscle contraction. Malignant hyperthermia: Feature Description Definition Rare, life-threatening reaction to certain anesthetic medications (inhaled anesthetics, succinylcholine). Inheritance Often autosomal dominant with variable penetrance (meaning not everyone with the gene will develop the condition). Underlying mechanism Mutations in the ryanodine receptor (RYR1) gene cause uncontrolled release of calcium (Ca2+) from the sarcoplasmic reticulum, leading to sustained muscle contraction and heat generation. Signs/Symptoms Severe muscle rigidity, rapid rise in body temperature (hyperthermia), increased heart rate, metabolic acidosis.

      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: C) Desflurane Explanation: Desflurane is known for its rapid onset and offset of action, making it a suitable choice for patients with cardiac conditions. It provides good cardiovascular stability and is associated with minimal metabolism in the body. It is less likely to cause myocardial depression and is suitable for patients with compromised cardiac function. Halothane (Option A): was once a commonly used anesthetic agent, but it has largely fallen out of favor due to its potential to cause arrhythmias and myocardial depression. Isoflurane (Option B): Isoflurane is a widely used inhalational anesthetic agent with a relatively stable cardiovascular profile. It is often considered suitable for patients with cardiac conditions, but it might not be the absolute preferred choice due to newer agents with even better cardiovascular stability. Sevoflurane (Option D): is also a popular choice for patients with cardiac conditions. It offers a smooth induction and emergence, as well as good cardiovascular stability. It is less likely to cause myocardial depression and is also associated with minimal metabolism in the body. Desflurane and Sevoflurane are often the preferred inhalational agents for patients with compromised cardiac function due to their rapid onset and offset, minimal metabolism, and overall good cardiovascular stability, but the best inhalational agent is Desflurane.
