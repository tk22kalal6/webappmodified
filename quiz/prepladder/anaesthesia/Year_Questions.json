      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: C) Etomidate Explanation: Etomidate inhibits 11 β -hydroxylase , an enzyme essential for cortisol synthesis in the adrenal glands. Single-dose administration can cause transient adrenal suppression , and prolonged use can lead to critical illness-related corticosteroid insufficiency (CIRCI) . It is often avoided in septic and critically ill patients due to the risk of adrenal insufficiency. Despite minimal cardiovascular depression, its use is limited in critically ill patients due to its endocrine effects. Etomidate and Adrenal Suppression Feature Details Drug Class Intravenous anesthetic Mechanism of Adrenal Suppression Inhibition of 11 β -hydroxylase Effect Duration Lasts 6-24 hours after a single dose Clinical Impact Reduces cortisol production, leading to adrenal insufficiency Contraindications Sepsis, adrenal insufficiency, critically ill patients Advantages Minimal cardiovascular depression, rapid onset Thiopental (Option A): Incorrect because it does not inhibit cortisol synthesis and has no significant adrenal suppression effects. Ketamine (Option B): Incorrect because ketamine does not affect adrenal function; it increases sympathetic tone and is often used in shock. Propofol (Option D): Incorrect because it does not cause adrenal suppression, though it can cause hypotension due to vasodilation.

      "question": "Which of the following is incorrect regarding thiopentone?",
      "options": {
        "A": "It is lipid soluble",
        "B": "It achieves maximum concentration in the brain after an IV infusion",
        "C": "Redistribution to adipose tissue and muscle is seen",
        "D": "Rapid decline in its effect is due to renal excretion"
      },
      "correct_answer": "D",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: D) Rapid decline in its effect is due to renal excretion Explanation: Thiopentone is a highly lipid-soluble barbiturate, allowing rapid penetration into the brain. Peak brain concentration occurs quickly after IV administration due to high cerebral perfusion. Redistribution from the brain to muscle and adipose tissue leads to a rapid decline in anesthetic effect within minutes. Termination of action is due to redistribution , not renal excretion. Renal elimination is slow and plays a minimal role in terminating its effect. Pharmacokinetics of Thiopentone Feature Details Drug Class Barbiturate Solubility Highly lipid-soluble Onset of Action Rapid (within 30 seconds IV) Termination of Effect Redistribution to muscle and fat Metabolism Hepatic metabolism (slow clearance) Excretion Primarily renal but not responsible for rapid effect decline Clinical Uses Induction of anesthesia, status epilepticus, neuroprotection It is lipid soluble (Option A): Correct because thiopentone is highly lipid-soluble, allowing rapid CNS penetration. It achieves maximum concentration in the brain after an IV infusion (Option B): Correct because peak brain levels occur within seconds after IV injection. Redistribution to adipose tissue and muscle is seen (Option C): Correct because redistribution accounts for rapid recovery from anesthesia rather than metabolism or excretion. Rapid decline in its effect is due to renal excretion (Option D): Incorrect because the effect declines due to redistribution , not renal clearance.

      "question": "A 35 y/o asthmatic patient is scheduled for a minor surgical procedure. Which induction agent and muscle relaxant combination is safest for this patient?",
      "options": {
        "A": "Propofol and Succinylcholine",
        "B": "Ketamine and d-tubocurarine",

      },
      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: C) Ketamine and Vecuronium Explanation: Ketamine is beneficial in asthmatics as it provides analgesia and induces bronchodilation without significant hemodynamic instability. Vecuronium is a non-depolarizing muscle relaxant that does not release histamine, making it safe for use in asthmatic patients. Anaesthesia in Asthmatics IV Induction Agent : Propofol : Preferred for stable patients, promotes bronchodilation. Ketamine : Ideal for hemodynamically unstable asthmatics, promotes bronchodilation. Muscle Relaxant : Vecuronium , Rocuronium , Cis-atracurium : Safe for use in asthmatics, no significant histamine release. Pancuronium : Releases low levels of histamine. Inhalational Agent : Sevoflurane , Isoflurane , Halothane : Ideal choices as they depress airway reflexes and relax bronchial smooth muscle. Desflurane : This should be avoided due to airway irritation and increased airway resistance. Propofol and Succinylcholine (Option A) : Succinylcholine may provoke bronchospasm. Ketamine and d-tubocurarine (Option B) : d-tubocurarine releases histamine, which can trigger bronchospasm. Thiopental and Rocuronium (Option D) : Thiopental has slower recovery times and can cause respiratory depression. Reference: Anasethsia asthma Miller’s Anaesthesia, 9th edition, Page 812",

      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: B) Etomidate Explanation: It is an α 2-receptors agonist therefore it maintains the vascular tone and myocardial contractility, thus maintaining cardiovascular haemodynamics which makes it an anesthetic of choice in cardiac disease. General Anesthetics for Cardiac Patients Intravenous Anesthetics: Thiopentone: Reduces myocardial contractility, preload, and blood pressure; administer slowly with caution. (Option D ruled out) Propofol: Significantly lowers blood pressure and heart rate; not ideal for patients with coronary artery disease (CAD) (Option C ruled out) Ketamine: Not suitable for ischemic heart disease (IHD) and valvular heart disease; useful in cardiac tamponade and cyanotic heart disease. Only IV agent to increase BP and HR. (Option A ruled out) Midazolam: Decreases mean arterial pressure and increases heart rate; provides excellent amnesia; safe for CAD patients. Etomidate: Causes minimal hemodynamic changes; good for patients with poor cardiac reserve. Agent of choice. (Option B) Narcotics: Preferred for cardiac stability and analgesia; newer agents like fentanyl and sufentanil also provide stability. Inhalational Agents: Isoflurane: Recommended for patients with good myocardial contractility. Halothane: Causes myocardial depression and dysrhythmias; Not used. Nitrous Oxide: Maintains stable hemodynamics in cardiac patients. Muscle Relaxants: Vecuronium: Minimal hemodynamic changes; short-acting, suitable for cardiac patients. Pipecuronium, Mivacurium, Doxacurium: Newer non-depolarizing agents with minimal cardiovascular side effects. Anticholinergics: Glycopyrrolate: Preferred over atropine for less tachycardia; use only as needed.

        "A": "Thiopentone",
        "B": "Propofol",
        "C": "Etomidate",

      },
      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: A) Thiopentone Explanation: Thiopentone is contraindicated in patients with acute intermittent porphyria (AIP). AIP is a disorder of heme biosynthesis, and thiopentone, a barbiturate used for induction of anesthesia, can trigger an acute attack of porphyria. It induces the synthesis of porphyrin precursors, exacerbating the disease and leading to symptoms such as abdominal pain, neuropathy, and mental changes. Incorrect Options: Propofol (option B) is considered safe for use in patients with acute intermittent porphyria. It does not induce the production of porphyrin precursors and is a commonly used anesthetic agent in these patients. Etomidate (option C) is another anesthetic agent that is generally safe for use in patients with acute intermittent porphyria. It does not affect the heme pathway and is often preferred in situations where other agents might be contraindicated. Ketamine (option D) can be used in patients with acute intermittent porphyria. It does not interfere with the porphyrin biosynthesis pathway and is often used in situations where general anesthesia is required, especially in cases of trauma or when other agents are contraindicated.

        "C": "Total hysterectomy",
        "D": "Subtotal hysterectomy"
      },
      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: A) Laparoscopic hysterectomy Explanation: Laparoscopic hysterectomy should be avoided in patients with moderate to severe cardiac disease due to the physiological changes caused by pneumoperitoneum (insufflation of the abdomen with carbon dioxide), including: Increased intra-abdominal pressure : Can lead to decreased venous return, increased afterload, and reduced cardiac output, which are particularly dangerous for patients with compromised cardiac function. Carbon dioxide absorption : Can cause hypercapnia, leading to respiratory acidosis and increased cardiac workload. Positioning during surgery : Trendelenburg position (head-down tilt) commonly used in laparoscopic surgeries can exacerbate hemodynamic instability. Incorrect Options: Abdominal hysterectomy (option B): Although it is more invasive, it avoids the hemodynamic complications of pneumoperitoneum and is relatively safer for patients with cardiac disease. Total hysterectomy (option C): This term refers to the removal of the uterus and cervix and can be performed abdominally or vaginally. The abdominal approach is safer than laparoscopic surgery in patients with cardiac disease. Subtotal hysterectomy (option D): This involves removing the uterus while leaving the cervix intact and can also be performed abdominally, which is safer for cardiac patients.

      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: B) Recovery and rehabilitation Explanation: The American Heart Association (AHA) has expanded the Chain of Survival concept by adding a sixth link: recovery and rehabilitation . This addition reflects the growing recognition that survival extends beyond the immediate resuscitation period . The complete AHA Chain of Survival now includes: Early recognition and activation of emergency response Early CPR with an emphasis on chest compressions Rapid defibrillation Advanced life support Post-cardiac arrest care Recovery/rehabilitation Rapid defibrillation (Option A) is already included as the third link. Rapid defibrillation remains a critical component for improving survival in cardiac arrest, particularly for shockable rhythms like ventricular fibrillation and pulseless ventricular tachycardia. High-quality CPR (Option C) constitutes the second link. The AHA emphasizes the importance of proper chest compression depth, rate, allowing full chest recoil, and minimizing interruptions in CPR to optimize outcomes. Advanced airway management (Option D) is part of the fourth link (advanced life support) in the Chain of Survival. While airway management is an important component of resuscitation, the AHA guidelines emphasize that it should not interfere with or delay other critical interventions such as chest compressions and defibrillation.",

        "D": "Cardioversion"
      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: B) Chest compressions and defibrillation Explanation: The rhythm in the ECG image is ventricular fibrillation (VF). This is a life-threatening arrhythmia characterized by chaotic and disorganized electrical activity in the ventricles, leading to the inability of the heart to pump blood effectively. For an unresponsive patient with ventricular fibrillation , the immediate step is: Chest compressions and defibrillation. Steps in Basic Life Support Skills: Check for pulse and breathing (Option A): While checking for pulse and breathing is crucial when assessing an unresponsive patient, in this case, the ECG already shows ventricular fibrillation, a shockable rhythm that implies cardiac arrest. There is no need to check for a pulse if the patient is unresponsive with this rhythm because VF always requires immediate chest compressions and defibrillation. Delaying treatment to check for a pulse could worsen outcomes. Put the patient in the left lateral position (Option C): The left lateral position is used to prevent aspiration in cases like unconscious patients with an intact airway or during pregnancy to reduce pressure on the inferior vena cava. However, in a patient with ventricular fibrillation, there is no effective cardiac output, and this position provides no benefit. Immediate CPR and defibrillation are the only lifesaving actions. Cardioversion (Option D): Cardioversion is used for arrhythmias like atrial fibrillation, atrial flutter, or supraventricular tachycardia in a hemodynamically unstable patient. It is a synchronized procedure delivered at a specific point in the cardiac cycle. Ventricular fibrillation requires unsynchronized defibrillation, not cardioversion, as there is no organized electrical activity to synchronize with.",

      "explanation": "given position (Recovery position) involves placing the patient on their side with the lower arm extended and the upper leg flexed at the hip and knee. This helps prevent the tongue from blocking the airway and allows secretions to drain from the mouth. It can help to maintain an open airway and improve ventilation. The given position is particularly useful in cases where the unconsciousness has been caused by alcohol or drug use, as these substances can increase the risk of aspiration (inhaling vomit or other liquids) and airway obstruction. By maintaining an open airway, the given position can help to prevent these complications and improve oxygenation of the tissues. Unconsciousness with pulse absent and breathing absent (Option A): This situation indicates cardiac arrest and requires cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR), including chest compressions and rescue breaths. Unconsciousness with pulse present and breathing absent (Option B): This situation requires artificial ventilation to support oxygenation. Unconsciousness with pulse absent and breathing present (Option D): This is a highly unlikely combination physiologically, as breathing is typically absent if the heart has stopped. If it were to occur, it would require immediate assessment and intervention, not the recovery position. Reference: https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3161868/",

        "D": "Bring the body temperature down to below 32 degrees, therapeutic hypothermia if unresponsive"
      },
      "correct_answer": "D",
      "explanation": "if unresponsive Correct Answer: D) Bring the body temperature down to below 32 degrees, therapeutic hypothermia if unresponsive Explanation: Targeted Temperature Management (TTM) is recommended between 32–36°C , but below 32°C is not advised due to potential risks like arrhythmias and coagulopathies. Therapeutic hypothermia (TTM) should be maintained at 32–36°C for at least 24 hours in comatose patients after cardiac arrest to reduce neurological damage. Excessive cooling (<32°C) increases complications such as bradycardia, electrolyte imbalances, and impaired coagulation. Post-Cardiac Arrest Care Post-cardiac arrest care focuses on stabilizing the patient, preventing secondary organ damage, and optimizing neurological outcomes. It includes hemodynamic management, targeted temperature management (TTM), oxygenation, and coronary intervention when indicated. Aspect Key Considerations Hemodynamic Support Maintain MAP ≥ 65 mmHg with fluids and vasopressors if needed to ensure adequate cerebral and organ perfusion. Oxygenation & Ventilation Target SpO I between 94–98% to prevent hypoxia and hyperoxia-related injury. Avoid excessive ventilation (PaCO I should be maintained at 35–45 mmHg). Targeted Temperature Management (TTM) Maintain temperature at 32–36°C for at least 24 hours in comatose patients to reduce neurological injury. Cooling below 32°C is not recommended due to increased risks of arrhythmias and coagulopathies. Coronary Revascularization Patients with ST elevation post-resuscitation should undergo urgent PCI to improve outcomes. Coronary angiography may also be considered in select non-ST elevation cases. Neurological Monitoring Continuous EEG and serial neurological assessments are crucial to detect seizures and assess prognosis. Glucose Control Maintain blood glucose between 140–180 mg/dL to prevent hyperglycemia-induced neuronal damage. Maintain MAP over 65 (Option A): Correct because maintaining adequate perfusion pressure (MAP ≥ 65 mmHg) is essential to prevent organ hypoxia. Maintain SpO I above 94% (Option B): Correct because post-resuscitation oxygenation should be between 94–98% to avoid both hypoxia and hyperoxia toxicity . Revascularisation procedure if patient develops ST elevation post resuscitation (Option C): Correct because emergency PCI should be done in post-cardiac arrest patients with STEMI to improve survival.

      "explanation": "rhythm condition that can cause cardiac arrest. Hence, it is necessary to stop V-fib immediately to restore pulse and blood pressure. The second focus should be on reducing the development of V-fib in the future. The treatment for ventricular fibrillation(V-fib) includes cardiopulmonary resuscitation, i.e., (CPR). Recent consensus guidelines for CPR advocate that chest compression immediately resumes after the defibrillation process. Pulse checks and rhythm checks can be postponed until the completion of five compressions, minimally for two minutes. Incorrect Options: Option A - Check for a pulse: The pulse check can be postponed for 2 minutes until the five-chest compression is completed. Option C - Epinephrine 1 mg IV: Epinephrine, 1 mg, is recommended every 3-5 minutes once IV or IO access is established until the completion of five compressions. Option D - Amiodarone 300 mg IV bolus: Amiodarone can be provided for ventricular tachycardia or ventricular fibrillation (VT/VF) cardiac arrest via intraosseous (IO)/intravenous (IV) infusion as a 300mg rapid bolus. A 150 mg IO/IV additional bolus is provided if VT persists. Reference: Harrison's 20th edition",

Incorrect Options: Option A - BMI >30: Obesity, indicated by a BMI greater than 30, is a known risk factor for postoperative pulmonary complications. It can impair lung function and increase the risk of respiratory complications after surgery. Option C - Upper abdominal surgery: Upper abdominal surgeries, such as surgeries involving the chest, abdomen, or diaphragm, can impact respiratory function due to the proximity to the respiratory muscles and potential effects on lung expansion. This increases the risk of postoperative pulmonary complications. Option D - Age >70 years: Advanced age is associated with decreased respiratory reserve and decreased lung function, making older individuals more susceptible to postoperative pulmonary complications.

        "D": "Radial artery is preferred site for taking sample"
      },
      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Allen test means that the patient has an adequate dual blood supply to the hand. A negative Allen test shows the patient may not have adequate dual blood supply, which would be a contraindication for catheterization, radial forearm flap harvest, or any procedure that may result in the occlusion of the vessel. Therefore this statement is incorrect. Incorrect options: Option A. Normal pH can't rule out an acid-base disorder: This statement is correct. Normal pH values in an ABG analysis do not rule out the presence of an acid-base disorder. Acid-base disorders involve disturbances in the pH, partial pressure of carbon dioxide (PaCO2), and bicarbonate (HCO3-) levels. As the patients having a combination of metabolic acidosis and metabolic alkalosis will have normal pH. Option B. Add 0.5 ml Heparin to the syringe before taking blood: This statement is correct. Heparin is typically added to the syringe before obtaining the arterial blood sample to prevent clotting of the blood in the syringe. Flushing the syringe will prevent clotting but leaving heparin behind will cause falsely low pH and bicarbonate. Option D. Radial artery is the preferred site: This statement is correct. The radial artery is preferred as it usually has good collateral circulation with the ulnar artery. Reference: Morgan and Mikhail's clinical anaesthisiology",

      "explanation": "in the management of cardiac arrest. It is used when initial treatments, such as epinephrine, fail to restore a stable heart rhythm. Amiodarone works by stabilizing the electrical activity of the heart and is effective in treating various types of life-threatening arrhythmias. Incorrect Options: Option A - Vasopressin: It has been used in the past as an alternative to epinephrine, current guidelines recommend epinephrine as the primary vasopressor in cardiac arrest. Amiodarone is the preferred alternative to epinephrine if it proves ineffective. Option B - Atropine: Atropine is a medication used to increase heart rate and treat certain types of bradycardia (slow heart rate). It is not typically effective in treating cardiac arrest, particularly in cases of ventricular fibrillation or pulseless ventricular tachycardia. Therefore, it is not the preferred alternative to epinephrine. Option D - Adenosine: Adenosine is primarily used in the treatment of supraventricular tachycardia (SVT), which is a different type of arrhythmia compared to ventricular fibrillation or pulseless ventricular tachycardia seen in cardiac arrest. Adenosine works by briefly slowing down the heart rate and interrupting the re-entry pathway responsible for SVT. It is not indicated for use during cardiac arrest and is not an alternative to epinephrine in that context. Reference: .",

      "explanation": "resuscitation, there are some differences between adults and children. Ventricular dysrhythmias, such as ventricular fibrillation and ventricular tachycardia, are more common in adults than in children. Therefore, the correct statement is that ventricular dysrhythmias are uncommon in children. Incorrect Options: Option B - Infant myocardium more refractory to hypoxia because of congenital heart disease: Infant myocardium more refractory to hypoxia because of congenital heart disease: This statement is incorrect. While certain congenital heart diseases may affect the myocardium's ability to handle hypoxia, it is not accurate to generalize that the infant myocardium is more refractory to hypoxia due to congenital heart disease. Option C - More ventilation to be given compared to chest compression: More ventilation to be given compared to chest compression: This statement is incorrect. In both adult and child resuscitation, the ratio of chest compressions to ventilation is different. For adults, it is typically 30:2 (30 compressions followed by 2 ventilations), while for children, it is often 15:2 or 30:2, depending on the circumstances. However, it is not accurate to say that more ventilation should be given compared to chest compressions in either case. Option D - Dissolved aortic oxygen concentration is more in pre attach state: Dissolved aortic oxygen concentration is more in pre-attach state: This statement is incorrect. The term \"pre-attach state\" is not clear in the context of resuscitation.
