      "question": "On performing polysomnography in a patient, the waves of EOG, EEG, and EMG, from above downwards, are seen below. Which stage of sleep do the marked areas represent? EOG: Electrooculography EEG: Electroencephalography EMG: Electromyography",

        "D": "NREM III sleep"
      },
      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: A) REM sleep Explanation: Based on the provided features of EOG, EEG, and EMG, the correct stage of sleep is REM sleep. REM findings on EEG, EOG, EMG EEG (Electroencephalogram) • EEG activity is increased similar to the awake state (beta activity) along with the return of alpha activity • The typical appearance of these waves is known as Sawtooth waves or Sawtooth appearance. • Paradoxical sleep: Even though the person is sleeping, the EEG shows activity similar to that of the awake state. • PGO (Ponto Geniculo Occipital) spikes are also seen - Large phasic potentials that originate from Pons (the cholinergic neurons) and go towards the lateral geniculate body and to the occipital spikes. EOG (Electrooculogram) Rapid eye movements are seen EMG (Electromyogram) • Tonic atonia (as if the muscle is in paralysis) with phasic twitches • It means there is a near-complete loss of muscle tone, preventing movement during vivid dreaming. NREM sleep: This is divided into 3 stages Stage 1: N1 stage Stage 2: N2 stage Stage 3 and Stage 4: Stages 3 and 4 have been combined into one stage known as the N3 stage. Stage EEG EOG EMG Awake (Stage W) Alpha waves (8-13 Hz) with eyes closed",

      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: A) Hypnogram Explanation: The above image represents a Hypnogram, a graphical representation of sleep stages over a period of time. It shows the different stages of sleep, such as wakefulness, rapid eye movement (REM) sleep, and various stages of non-REM sleep. It typically displays the amount of time spent in each stage over the course of the night, providing insights into sleep architecture. This helps clinicians evaluate sleep quality and diagnose sleep disorders. It typically reflects: Sequence and duration of various sleep stages (N1, N2, N3, and REM) throughout the night. The cyclic nature of sleep shows transitions between stages over time and the relative amount of time spent in each stage. Electroencephalogram (EEG) (Option B) is a test that measures the electrical activity of the brain using electrodes placed on the scalp. It is used to record and analyze brain wave patterns and can provide information about brain function and abnormalities. Polysomnogram (Option C) is a comprehensive sleep study that involves monitoring various physiological parameters during sleep. It typically includes the recording of brain activity (EEG), eye movements (electrooculogram), muscle activity (electromyogram), heart rate and rhythm (electrocardiogram), respiratory airflow and effort, and oxygen saturation levels. A polysomnogram is used to diagnose sleep disorders and evaluate sleep quality. Epworth sleep assessment (Option D) is a questionnaire used to assess an individual's daytime sleepiness or propensity to fall asleep in various situations. It does not involve monitoring physiological parameters or providing a visual representation like the other options mentioned.",

      "question": "What medication is typically prescribed to treat the condition experienced by a 25-year-old woman who complains of a sensation resembling creepy crawling in her legs? This symptom is more pronounced at night and hinders her ability to sleep. However, she finds relief by either engaging in walking or moving her legs.",
      "options": {
        "A": "Gabapentin",
        "B": "Pramipexole",
        "C": "Vitamin B12",
        "D": "Iron tablets"
      },
      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer A - Gabapentin The condition described is Restless Legs Syndrome (RLS), which causes an uncomfortable urge to move the legs, often accompanied by crawling, tingling, or itching sensations, especially at night. Gabapentin , an anticonvulsant medication, is a first-line medication used to treat this syndrome. Restless Legs Syndrome Explanation It is also known as Willis-Ekbom Disease and is characterised by an uncomfortable sensation in the legs, especially in the evening or at night, which leads to an irresistible urge to move them. The movement temporarily relieves the discomfort, but the symptoms soon return, causing difficulty falling asleep or maintaining sleep. This leads to insomnia, which is a common complaint in patients with RLS. Clinical Features Sensations that begin after rest Relief of discomfort with movement Worsening of symptoms at night with a distinct symptom-free period in the early morning Treatment No definite cure, but symptoms can be managed. Movement of affected limbs may provide temporary relief. Treat underlying conditions like peripheral neuropathy, diabetes, or iron deficiency anaemia to control symptoms. Medications: Iron supplements : For RLS linked to iron deficiency. (Option D ruled out) Anti-seizure drugs (first-line treatment): FDA-approved: Gabapentin, enacarbil , and others like pregabalin . Dopaminergic agents : FDA-approved: Ropinirole, pramipexole, rotigotine . (Option A ruled out) Levodopa + carbidopa are used intermittently. Opioids : For severe cases unresponsive to other drugs (e.g., methadone, oxycodone ). Benzodiazepines : For better sleep ( clonazepam, lorazepam ). Lifestyle Modifications: Avoid alcohol, nicotine, and caffeine. Maintain a regular sleep pattern. Engage in moderate exercise. Use leg massage, warm baths, heating pads, or foot wraps for relief. Vitamin B12 (Option C) deficiency can contribute to neuropathy , but it is not a primary cause of Restless Legs Syndrome . Vitamin B12 would be prescribed only if a deficiency was identified, but it is not a treatment for RLS. Reference: NIH Link",

      },
      "correct_answer": "D",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: D) Stage 4 Explanation: The red-highlighted EEG findings show slow wave sleep (SWS), which typically corresponds to the dominance of delta waves , which is characteristic of Stage 4 sleep, indicating the deepest level of non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep. Stage EEG Awake (Stage W) Alpha waves (8-13 Hz) with eyes closed N1 Stage (Light Sleep) (Option A ruled out) Loss of alpha waves, theta waves (4-7 Hz) N2 Stage (Moderate Sleep) (Option B ruled out) Sleep spindles (12-14 Hz), K complexes (sharp negative followed by positive waves) N3 Stage (Deep Sleep) (Option C ruled out) Delta waves (slow, high amplitude) N4 Stage It largely overlaps with Stage 3 in terms of characteristics. Predominantly delta waves (low-frequency, high-amplitude brain waves) indicate very deep sleep. Reference: Kaplan and Sadock’s Synopsis of Psychiatry, 12th Edition, Page 155",

      "question": "Which of the following statements about somnambulism is incorrec t?",
      "options": {
        "A": "Disorder of sleep arousal",
        "B": "Person will have full consciousness",
        "C": "Usually, terminates in awakening followed by confusion",
        "D": "There may be neurological condition associated"
      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": ", is a parasomnia disorder characterized by complex motor behaviors and actions during sleep . During an episode of somnambulism, individuals are in a state of partial arousal from sleep, and their consciousness is typically impaired or altered. Incorrect Options: Option A - Disorder of sleep arousal : Somnambulism is classified as a disorder of sleep arousal because it involves partial awakenings from sleep with the occurrence of complex behaviors. Option C - Usually terminates in awakening followed by confusion: Somnambulism episodes often end with the sleepwalker waking up, and upon awakening, they may experience confusion and disorientation about their surroundings or actions during the episode. Option B - There may be a neurological condition associated : While somnambulism can occur in otherwise healthy individuals, there can also be underlying neurological conditions or factors that contribute to its occurrence. These may include conditions such as epilepsy, sleep disorders, or certain medications. Reference: Prepladder Notes",
