      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "Correct answer: A) Projection Explanation: Here the person projects his own thoughts onto someone else, this type of defense mechanism is known as Projection - a part of narcissistic defenses. Narcissistic Defenses: Defense Features Example Projection (Option A) A person projects his own thoughts onto someone else. Seen in psychosis. Mr.P is having an affair but is convinced that his wife has an affair. Denial (Option B) Refuse to accept reality Usually used to avoid some painful stimuli Refusal to admit to having a serious illness Distortion (Option D) Reshaping external reality in a person’s favor to suit his/her inner needs Mr.X believed that his boss was rude to him because in fact he likes X more than anyone else Splitting Viewing people/things in the world as either good/bad without considering the whole range. Seen in Borderline personality disorder. Seeing all people without moustache as feminine. Regression (Option C): Type of immature defense. A person returns to an earlier stage of development (acts childish). Reference: Kaplan & Sadock’s Synopsis of Psychiatry, 12th Edition, Page 3345,3346",

      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Correct answer: B) Regression Explanation: Regression is a type of immature defense mechanism, not neurotic. Regression is the return to an earlier stage of development (act childish/ younger). Example: Husband returns after a stressful day, and converses with wife in baby talks. Neurotic defenses: Defense Features Example Inhibition Unconsciously limiting an aim and accepting partial fulfilment of desire. If a person is unable to clear the entrance exam for MBBS, he becomes a veterinary doctor. Intellectualization Excessive use of intellect to escape painful emotions. After getting diagnosed with a metastatic tumor, a person starts discussing a great deal about its technical aspects. Isolation of affect Separation of emotions related to a stressful event, but reality is accepted. A man comes home and tells his family of his lung cancer without any emotions. Displacement (Option A) Unconscious shifting of impulses from one object to another, to solve a conflict. A man gets angry with his boss and shouts at his wife, the wife shouts at her son, and the son punches his toy. Dissociation Separation of one or more mental functions from remaining functions to avoid distress. A person was kidnapped and tortured, he says it was as if he was floating on the ceiling and watching it. Undoing (Option D) An act to nullify a previous act. Performing compulsions in OCD, apologizing. Rationalisation Giving logical explanations for unacceptable behaviors. Seen in Substance use disorders. A person says he drinks alcohol because it kills all the germs in his body. Reaction formation Doing the reverse of your unacceptable emotions. Over Caring for the person you don’t like. Repression (Option C) Unconscious forgetting Such memories (stored in the preconscious mind) can be brought out by techniques like Hypnosis/free association. A child has been abused by his mother, and now has no memory of that abuse. Externalisation Perceiving one’s personality (mood/impulses/etc.) within the external world. Similar to projection. An argumentative type of person believes others are arguing while the personal self is blameless. Retroflexion Unconscious projection of another's personality to one’s hostility. Mr.X (arrogant and short-tempered in reality) hates me because I am not worth enough. Reference: Kaplan & Saddock’s Synopsis of Psychiatry, 12th Edition, Pages 3349-3351",

      },
      "correct_answer": "D",
      "explanation": "Correct answer: D) Introjection Explanation: Attributing to oneself the qualities of another is called Introjection - a type of immature defense mechanism. Immature defenses: Defense Features Example Blocking Inhibition of thinking (temporary) is associated with a component of tension (inability to remember). A student unable to recall the answer in the exam (temporary), but recalls as he comes out of the exam. Acting out Unconscious wishes are enacted in behavior to avoid being aware of them. Seen in impulse control disorders. A student is angry with his friend, Rather than telling him he throws a book at him (not intentionally). Regression Return to an earlier stage of development (act childish/ younger). Husband returns after a stressful day, and converses with wife in baby talks. Introjection (Option D) Opposite to projection. Attributing to oneself the qualities of another. Stockholm syndrome: Hostages get sympathetic towards their captors. People often treat their children the same way their parents treat them. Projective identification A person projects some aspect of himself onto someone else. Tries to coerce another person into identifying that he/she is projected. Seen in Borderline personality disorder. The wife is aggressive toward the husband, then the husband also shows his aggressiveness. Somatization Unconscious moments are converted to bodily/ physical moments. Getting a headache while taking exams. Hypo- chondriasis Unconscious transforming of unacceptable impulses to unrelated somatic complaints of pain, and illness. Exaggerating a physical symptom (e.g. headache) for the purpose of regression. Passive aggression Indirectly expressing aggression towards others. Refusing to take medications after a family quarrel.

      },
      "correct_answer": "D",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: D) Sublimation Explanation: Since the subject is channelling emotional conflicts into creative or physical activities, this is an example of sublimation Mature defences: Affiliation The subject seeks help or advice not to have the problem solved by others, but to find a solution they can implement themselves, and learn from emotionally meaningful interactions. (Option A ruled out) Going to therapy/supportive group/spiritual/etc. Altruism The subject helps others with problems they cannot handle alone, finding personal meaning and gratification in helping, often tied to similar past experiences. (Option B ruled out) After the death of the husband, due to smoking, the wife starts a 'No smoking' campaign. Anticipation The subject prepares emotionally for upcoming stressful situations by thinking ahead, imagining outcomes, and planning how to cope. After failing the exam, the student plans to argue while going home. Humor The subject uses humor to diffuse tension in difficult or embarrassing situations, often making self-deprecatory or ironic remarks to lighten the mood without harm. A man comes out and laughs after getting scolded by the boss. Self-assertion The subject confidently expresses thoughts, wishes, or feelings, deals with their own needs directly, and stands up for themselves in emotionally difficult situations. (Option C ruled out) The wife tells her alcoholic husband to choose between her (or) alcohol and leaves the house. Sublimation The subject channels emotional conflicts into socially valued ones creative or physical activities, finding satisfaction or mastery in the process. (Option D) A child gets angry at being scolded at home and scores 100 runs in a school cricket match. Suppression The subject consciously sets aside desires or emotions that may lead to bad consequences, postponing emotional responses to handle immediate, urgent tasks effectively. A student decides to forget about the upcoming exam and take a day's break.

      },
      "correct_answer": "D",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: D) Dogs stopped salivating at sounds associated with food Explanation: Extinction is when the conditioned response (salivating at sounds associated with food arriving) weakens and disappears. Classical conditioning: Unconscious learning method in which an automatic, conditioned response is paired with specific stimuli. Pavlov’s Experiment with Dogs- At first, the dogs would only salivate when the food was placed in front of them. However, later they salivated slightly before their food arrived at the noises related to food arrival; for example, the sound of an approaching food cart. Here, Unconditioned stimulus- food Unconditioned response- salivation on seeing the food Conditioned stimulus- sound associated with food Conditioned response- salivation on sounds associated with food Extinction Stimulus Generalization Definition The conditioned response weakens and eventually disappears due to the conditioned stimulus being presented without the unconditioned stimulus. A conditioned response is elicited by stimuli that are similar to the conditioned stimulus. Example If Pavlov rang the bell (conditioned stimulus) without presenting food (unconditioned stimulus), the dogs would eventually stop salivating at the sound of the bell (conditioned response) If Pavlov’s dogs salivated in response to a sound similar to the bell, such as a cell phone ringing, this would illustrate stimulus generalization.

        "D": "Integrity vs. Despair"
      },
      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: C) Generativity vs. Stagnation Explanation: Erikson's stage of Generativity vs. Stagnation, typically encountered during middle adulthood (40–65 years), involves a focus on contributing to society and helping the next generation. Failure to achieve this leads to feelings of stagnation and a lack of purpose, as seen in the patient's symptoms. Erik Erikson's theory of psychosocial development identifies eight stages of development: Stage 1 Trust vs. Mistrust (Birth to 18 months) Infants learn to trust or mistrust the world based on the consistency of care from their caregivers. Stage 2 Autonomy vs. Shame and Doubt (18 months to 3 years) Children develop a sense of personal control and independence or feel shame and doubt about their abilities. Stage 3 Initiative vs. Guilt (3 years to 5 years) Children assert power and control over their environment, leading to a sense of initiative or feelings of guilt. (Option B) Stage 4 Industry vs. Inferiority (5 years to 13 years) Children develop self-confidence in abilities when competent or a sense of inferiority when not. (Option A) Stage 5 Identity vs. Role Confusion (13 years to 21 years) Adolescents explore their personal identity and values or become confused about their role in life. Stage 6 Intimacy vs. Isolation (21 years to 40 years) Young adults form deep, meaningful relationships, or experience loneliness and isolation. Stage 7 Generativity vs. Stagnation (40 years to 60 years) Adults seek to contribute to society and future generations, or feel stagnant and disconnected from broader purposes. Stage 8 Integrity vs. Despair (60 years to death) Older adults reflect on their life, either feeling a sense of fulfilment and integrity, or regret and despair.
