Premature Ejaculation(PME) (DSM-5 Definition): Persistent or recurrent ejaculation occurs with minimal sexual stimulation, either before or shortly after vaginal penetration. Ejaculation typically occurs within less than 1 minute following vagina l penetration. Cause of PME is usually psychogenic. Incorrect Options: Cognitive behavioural therapy (Option A) can be effective in managing many psychological conditions, such as anxiety, depression, and some physiological conditions, but it is not the most direct or effective non-pharmacological intervention for premature ejaculation. Exposure and Response Prevention Therapy (Option B) is a form of cognitive behavioural therapy that is primarily used to treat obsessive-compulsive disorder, not premature ejaculation. Sensate focus therapy (Option D) is a form of sex therapy that involves exercises to improve sexual communication and reduce performance anxiety. While it can be beneficial in managing various sexual dysfunctions, it is not specifically targeted toward premature ejaculation.
