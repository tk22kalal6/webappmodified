Bipolar I Disorder involves manic episodes, often with mood-congruent psychotic features, but psychosis usually occurs only during mood episodes. Schizophrenia involves persistent psychotic symptoms without prominent mood episodes. Mood disorder with psychotic features features psychosis only during mood episodes, never independently. Diagnosis Key Feature Explanation Schizoaffective Disorder Psychotic symptoms with mood episodes and outside mood episodes Psychosis is present both during mood episodes and independently Bipolar I Disorder Manic episodes with mood-congruent psychosis Psychosis restricted to mood episodes only Schizophrenia Psychosis without mood episodes No significant mood symptoms Mood disorder with psychotic features Psychosis only during mood episodes Psychosis disappears outside mood episodes Bipolar I Disorder (Option A): Incorrect because psychosis occurs only during mood episodes, not independently. Schizophrenia (Option B): Incorrect because the patient has mood symptoms and psychosis; schizophrenia does not have prominent mood episodes. Mood disorder with psychotic features (Option D): Incorrect because psychosis is limited to mood episodes, not independent of mood.

Manifestations Subjective: Patient reports feeling restless Objective: (noticed by others) Anxiety Inability to relax Jitteriness Rocking motion Pacing around Rapid alteration of sitting and standing Management Reduce the dosage of the current medication. Switch to atypical or low-potency typical antipsychotics. Treat with appropriate medications: Beta-blockers (Propranolol is the drug of choice) Anticholinergics Benzodiazepines Consider changing the neuroleptic if needed. Dystonia (Option A) refers to brief or prolonged muscle contractions causing abnormal movements or postures, such as oculogyric crises (upward eye rolling), tongue protrusion, trismus, torticollis (neck muscle twisting), laryngeal-pharyngeal dystonias, and dystonic postures of the limbs and trunk. Anticholinergic drugs like, benztropine, diphenhydramine and promethazine can be used for treatment. Tardive dyskinesia (Option C) is a delayed effect of antipsychotics that typically occurs after six months of treatment. It is characterised by abnormal, involuntary, irregular choreoathetoid movements in the muscles of the head, limbs, and trunk. Valbenazine is the drug of choice in its management. Parkinsonism (Option D) refers to a group of movement disorders that mimic the symptoms of Parkinson's disease, including tremors, stiffness, bradykinesia (slowness of movement), and postural instability. It is treated with anticholinergics, levodopa-carbidopa, dopamine agonists and MAO-B inhibitors based on symptom severity.

Antipsychotics often require dose adjustments to achieve therapeutic levels. Switching to another antipsychotic may be considered if the patient fails to respond to a higher dose or experiences intolerable side effects . (Option B ruled out) Selecting Second Treatment Options for Acute Schizophrenia: 1. Treatment Change Criteria Patients who do not respond even slightly by the second week are less likely to benefit from the current medication, indicating that a treatment change may be necessary. Assessing the degree of symptom improvement is more informative than labelling patients as responders or nonresponders. 2. Adequate Trial: Consists of a 4-6 week period on a proper dose of antipsychotic medication. Patients showing even mild improvement during this time may continue to benefit for 3 to 6 months. 3. Monitoring and Compliance: Plasma concentration monitoring can help confirm adequate dosing. Low plasma levels may indicate non-compliance or inadequate absorption; increasing the dose may be beneficial in these cases. High plasma levels might suggest that side effects are hindering the therapeutic response. 4. Adjusting Treatment: While increasing the dose above the standard therapeutic range may be considered, switching to another medication is generally preferred if no improvement is observed. Clozapine is particularly effective for patients unresponsive to other antipsychotics, showing significant advantages in those with severe symptoms. Initiate Electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) (Option C) : ECT is generally considered for severe cases of schizophrenia, particularly when there is treatment resistance or severe mood symptoms (such as depression) accompanying the psychosis. Initiate Cognitive Behaviour Therapy (CBT) (Option D) : CBT can be beneficial as an adjunctive treatment for schizophrenia, especially in managing residual symptoms and improving coping mechanisms. However, it is not a substitute for pharmacological treatment.

      "explanation": "antipsychotic , is considered first-line due to its efficacy in managing both positive symptoms (e.g., hallucinations and delusions) and negative symptoms (e.g., social withdrawal), with a lower risk of extrapyramidal side effects compared to first-generation antipsychotics like Fluphenazine, Haloperidol. Management of Schizophrenia: Pharmacotherapy: Acute Treatment Phase: Address severe symptoms, lasting typically 4-8 weeks. Antipsychotic medications are the primary treatment, with guidelines favouring second-generation (Atypical) antipsychotics for their broader efficacy and improved side effect profiles. Antipsychotic Medications: First Generation Antipsychotics (Typical) Second Generation Antipsychotics (Atypical) Second Generation Antipsychotics (Atypical) D2 receptor antagonist Partial D2 Agonists D2/5-HT2A Antagonists Haloperidol (Option D) Fluphenazine (Option A) Perphenazine Chlorpromazine Aripiprazole Brexpiprazole Cariprazine (Option D) Risperidone Olanzapine Quetiapine Ziprasidone Paliperidone Lurasidone Clozapine Treatment Duration: For first-episode patients, a minimum of 1-2 years of treatment is recommended. For those with multiple episodes , 5 years - indefinite treatment is often advised. Side Effects: Extrapyramidal Side Effects (EPS) Common with first-generation antipsychotics, including symptoms like Acute dystonia - Earliest, can occur within minutes of the injection Pseudo Parkinson ism - Occurs within days to weeks Akathisia - Occurs within days to weeks Alternatives for management include dose reduction, antiparkinson medications, or switching to medications with lower EPS risk. Tardive Dyskinesia (TD) Affects 20-30% of patients on long-term first-generation antipsychotics, with higher risk in the elderly and those with cognitive or mood disorders. Prevention strategies include using the lowest effective doses and switching to other medications like Clozapine. Sedation & Postural hypotension Especially with low-potency antipsychotics. Long-term antipsychotic use can elevate prolactin levels, affecting sexual function and potentially leading to osteoporosis. Lithium (mood stabiliser) (Option C) is primarily used for bipolar disorder and is not effective for treating schizophrenia symptoms.

Men often experience more negative symptoms; women generally have better social functioning and outcomes. Late-onset schizophrenia occurs after age 45 (3-10% of women). 90% of treated patients are aged 15-55. Risk factors of Schizophrenia: Seasonality of birth : Increased prevalence in those born in winter/early spring (Option B) (Northern Hemisphere: January-April; Southern Hemisphere: July-September). Maternal factors : Complications during delivery, malnutrition & maternal illness. Early life experiences : Childhood trauma (Option A) , social isolation, and deprivation may increase risk. Urban upbringing (Option C) : Risk is higher for those raised in cities. Cannabis use : Associated with increased risk of schizophrenia, particularly in heavy users (up to 40% increase ). Cognitive deficits : Poor verbal learning, memory issues, and slower processing speed may predict impending psychosis.
