      "question": "A 72-year-old male presents with progressive memory decline and difficulty performing daily tasks. Neuroimaging shows significant atrophy in the medial temporal lobe, and cerebrospinal fluid analysis reveals high levels of certain neurotoxic oligomers. Which of the following statements regarding the pathology and pathophysiology of this patient’s condition is false?",
      "options": {
        "A": "Soluble neurotoxic oligomers lead to synapse loss.",
        "B": "Neurofibrillary tangles contain hyperphosphorylated tau protein.",
        "C": "Plaques indicate polymerization of the neurotoxic proteins.",
        "D": "Increased acetylcholine, norepinephrine and serotonin."
      },
      "correct_answer": "D",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: D) Increased acetylcholine, norepinephrine and serotonin. Explanation: In Alzheimer's disease, there is a reduction in acetylcholine due to the degeneration of cholinergic neurons. Additionally, norepinephrine and serotonin levels are also typically decreased due to degeneration in the respective areas (locus coeruleus and dorsal raphe). Pathophysiology of Alzheimer’s Disease: Self-aggregation of amyloid-beta (A β ) into soluble low-n oligomers causes synaptotoxicity in Alzheimer's disease. (Option A ruled out) Soluble A β is strongly correlated with cortical synapse loss, an early pathological event. Cognitive impairment is a direct consequence of synaptic damage. Further polymerization of A β leads to fibril formation and the development of amyloid plaques. (Option C ruled out) Mutations in the APP gene increase metabolism of APP through β -secretase activity. Mutations in presenilin 1 (PS1) and presenilin 2 (PS2) are linked to γ -secretase activity. A β also accumulates in cerebral arterioles, leading to cerebral amyloid angiopathy. A β contributes to the phosphorylation of tau protein, resulting in neurofibrillary tangles. Pathology: Macroscopic Pathology Earliest degeneration: Seen in the medial temporal lobe (entorhinal/perirhinal cortex and hippocampus), inferolateral temporal cortex, and nucleus basalis of Meynert. Amyloid plaques: Formed by amyloid beta (A β ), proteoglycans, ApoE, α -antichymotrypsin, and other proteins. Amyloid angiopathy: Accumulation of A β in cerebral arterioles. Microscopic Pathology Neuritic plaques: Central core of amyloid surrounded by dystrophic neurites and activated microglia. Neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs): Composed of abnormally hyperphosphorylated tau protein, which forms paired helical filaments. (Option B ruled out) Tau pathology: Hyperphosphorylated tau compromises microtubule function and leads to neuronal dysfunction. Coexisting pathologies: Often seen with DLB, TDP-43, or vascular pathology. Neurotransmitters Acetylcholine reduction: Due to degeneration of cholinergic neurons in the",

      "correct_answer": "D",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: D) Ventromedial orbitofrontal cortex Explanation: The patient's symptoms, including impulsivity, poor social judgment, difficulty with planning, emotional lability, and perseveration, are classic signs of frontal lobe syndrome , specifically involving the ventromedial orbitofrontal cortex. Frontal Lobe Syndrome Area Functions Symptoms when Damaged Ventromedial Orbitofrontal Cortex Social behavior Impulse control Decision making Emotional regulation Impulsivity Poor social judgment Emotional lability Disinhibition Dorsolateral Prefrontal Cortex Working memory Planning Attention Problem-solving Difficulty with planning and organization Poor working memory Reduced motivation (abulia) Perseveration Anterior Cingulate Cortex Motivation Error detection Emotional processing Apathy Reduced initiative Difficulty with emotional regulation Broca's Area (Left Frontal Lobe) Speech production Expressive aphasia (non-fluent) While temporal lobe damage can cause memory problems and emotional changes, it doesn't typically cause the impulsivity and poor judgment seen in this patient.

        "B": "Transient global amnesia",
        "C": "Korsakoff syndrome",
        "D": "Multiple sclerosis"
      },
      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: C) Korsakoff syndrome Explanation: The patient's history of chronic alcohol use, combined with symptoms of confusion, memory problems (particularly for recent events), and confabulation, is highly suggestive of Korsakoff syndrome. This condition is caused by thiamine (vitamin B1) deficiency, often associated with chronic alcoholism. Korsakoff syndrome frequently follows Wernicke's encephalopathy , which is characterized by the classic triad of ophthalmoplegia, ataxia, and confusion . In this case, the presence of confabulation, memory deficits, and alcohol history makes Korsakoff syndrome the most likely diagnosis. Cause of Confabulation: Confabulation occurs in several neurological conditions where memory is compromised, including: Wernicke-Korsakoff syndrome (thiamine deficiency) Anton syndrome (denial of visual impairment) Traumatic brain injury (TBI) Amnestic Disorders- Causes Amnestic Disorder Cause Key Features Korsakoff Syndrome Thiamine deficiency, often due to chronic alcoholism • Anterograde and retrograde amnesia • Confabulation • Personality changes • Often follows Wernicke encephalopathy Transient Global Amnesia Unknown, possibly related to temporal lobe ischemia • Sudden onset of anterograde amnesia • Episodes last 6-24 hours • Complete recovery is typical Head Injury-Related Amnesia Traumatic brain injury • Retrograde amnesia for events leading up to injury • Anterograde amnesia post-injury • Severity correlates with injury severity Cerebrovascular Disease-Related Amnesia Infarctions affecting hippocampus or thalamus • Memory impairment • Often accompanied by other focal neurological signs Alcoholic Blackouts Acute alcohol intoxication • Inability to remember events during intoxication • Awareness of memory gap upon sobering ECT-Related Amnesia Electroconvulsive therapy • Retrograde amnesia for minutes before treatment • Anterograde amnesia after treatment • Usually resolves within hours to months While Alzheimer's disease can cause memory problems, it typically has a more gradual onset and doesn't present with the acute confusion and confabulation described in this case. (Option A) This condition is characterized by sudden onset of anterograde amnesia that typically resolves within 24 hours. It doesn't explain the chronic nature of this patient's symptoms or the history of alcohol use. (Option B) While multiple sclerosis can cause cognitive symptoms, including memory problems, it typically presents with other neurological symptoms and is not associated with chronic alcohol use.

      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: B) Donepezil Explanation: For patients with mild to moderate Alzheimer's disease, cholinesterase inhibitors like donepezil are the first-line pharmacological treatment . They can help improve cognitive function and activities of daily living. Management of Dementia and Alzheimer’s Management Strategy Details Pharmacological Cholinesterase inhibitors (e.g., donepezil, rivastigmine - used as a transdermal patch, galantamine) for mild to moderate Alzheimer's disease Memantine - blocks NMDA glutamate receptors, for moderate to severe Alzheimer's disease (Option A) Antidepressants for comorbid depression Antipsychotics (with caution) for severe behavioral disturbances Non-pharmacological Cognitive stimulation therapy Reality orientation Reminiscence therapy Behavioral management techniques Physical exercise programs Environmental Modifications Simplify the living environment Use memory aids (e.g., calendars, to-do lists) Ensure adequate lighting Remove potential hazards Caregiver Support Education about the disease Respite care Support groups Counseling Newly approved drugs for treatment of early Alzheimer's disease. Aducanumab (Aduhelm) - Monoclonal antibody targeting amyloid-beta plaques. Lecanemab (Leqembi) - Monoclonal antibody targeting soluble amyloid-beta protofibrils, facilitating plaque clearance. Donanemab - Monoclonal antibody targeting amyloid plaques; selectively binds to a modified form of amyloid-beta. While memantine is used in dementia treatment, it's typically reserved for moderate to severe Alzheimer's disease, often in combination with a cholinesterase inhibitor. (Option A) Antipsychotics like risperidone are only used cautiously in dementia for severe behavioral disturbances, not as a first-line treatment for cognitive symptoms. (Option C) Antidepressants may be used in dementia patients with comorbid depression, but they're not the primary treatment for cognitive symptoms.

      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "impairment Correct Answer: C) A score of 23/24 is traditionally used as a cut-off for suspected cognitive impairment Explanation: The Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) , also known as the Folstein test, is a 30-question assessment of cognitive function. A score of 23 or 24 out of 30 is traditionally used as a cut-off for suspected cognitive impairment including dementia. Key points about the MMSE include: It evaluates ORRAL (mnemonic) Orientation Registration Recall Attention and concentration Language. It is widely used and accepted among health professionals and researchers. The test is brief, usually taking no more than 10 minutes to administer. (Option B) A score of 23 or 24 out of 30 is traditionally used as a cut-off for suspected cognitive impairment, though this can vary based on population norms. Scores can be influenced by sociocultural variables, age, and education level, necessitating the development of local standards for each population and setting.

        "D": "Alzheimer's Disease"
      },
      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: C) Neurocognitive Disorder due to Prion Disease Explanation: The patient's presentation of progressive cognitive decline, memory issues, confusion, and myoclonic jerks, along with a history of consuming venison (which can potentially be contaminated with prions causing Chronic Wasting Disease), is most consistent with a prion disease such as Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease . Causes of Neurocognitive Decline Characteristic Due to Traumatic Brain Injury Due to HIV Infection Due to Prion Disease History H/O traumatic brain injury, with associated noncognitive symptoms HIV diagnosis, Associated cognitive symptoms Cognitive impairment: Subtle onset, Rapid progression Key Symptoms Loss of consciousness Amnesia following trauma Confusion/ disorientation Neuroimaging evidence of injury/ Neurologic symptoms Cognitive symptoms associated with HIV infection May include memory issues, attention deficits, and slowed processing speed Rapid cognitive decline Motor symptoms (e.g., myoclonus/ ataxia) Biochemical marker on testing Onset Acute, following traumatic event Gradual, as HIV progresses Subtle onset, but rapid progression Course Can improve, stabilize, or worsen over time Often fluctuates with HIV treatment and progression Progressive rapid decline EEG findings in Prion Disease: Triphasic Waves - Repetitive, sharp waves followed by a slower wave. Frequency: 1-2 Hz. Generalized slowing (theta and delta waves). Decreased amplitude of brain waves. Periodic sharp wave complexes (PSWCs) may be present. Changes are bilateral and symmetric . Alpha rhythm may be attenuated or absent Neurocognitive Disorder due to Traumatic Brain Injury (Option A) is incorrect as there is no history of head trauma mentioned, and the onset is described as progressive rather than acute. Neurocognitive Disorder due to HIV Infection (Option B) is incorrect because there's no mention of HIV diagnosis or risk factors, and the progression is typically not as rapid as described in this case. Alzheimer's Disease (Option C) is incorrect because the progression is too rapid for typical Alzheimer's, and the presence of myoclonic jerks is more suggestive of prion disease.

      "options": {
        "A": "Fluctuating levels of attention",
        "B": "Recurrent visual hallucinations",
        "C": "Systematized delusions",
        "D": "Parkinsonian features"
      },
      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: C) Systematized delusions Explanation: While delusions can occur in DLB, systematized delusions (fixed false beliefs that are well organized) are not considered a core feature of the condition, rather are considered a supporting feature. DLB primarily features hallucinations, particularly visual ones, rather than structured delusions. Dementia with Lewy Bodies Dementia with Lewy Bodies (DLB) is a neurodegenerative disorder characterized by cognitive decline sufficient to interfere with social or occupational functioning. Early symptoms may include difficulties with attention, fronto-subcortical skills, and visuospatial ability, rather than prominent memory issues. Clinical Features: Probable DLB requires two or more core symptoms, while possible DLB requires at least one. Core Features Supporting Features Fluctuating levels of attention and alertness (Option A ruled out) Recurrent visual hallucinations (Option B ruled out) Parkinsonian features (e.g., cogwheeling, bradykinesia, resting tremor) (Option D ruled out) REM Sleep behavior disorder Repeated falls Syncope Sensitivity to neuroleptics Systematized delusions (Option C) Hallucinations in other modalities (e.g., auditory, tactile) Differences in features of LBD and PD: Feature Lewy Body Dementia (LBD) Parkinson's Disease (PD) Onset of Symptoms Cognitive and psychiatric symptoms appear early; motor symptoms develop later. Primarily motor symptoms appear first (e.g., bradykinesia, rigidity, tremors). Visual Hallucinations Common and can occur early. Less common initially; may occur later, often due to treatment. Fluctuations in Attention Fluctuations in alertness and attention are characteristic. Fluctuations are primarily related to medication cycles. Response to Medications Poor response to dopaminergic medications; risk of worsening psychiatric symptoms. Generally improves with dopaminergic medications (e.g., levodopa). Sleep Disturbances REM sleep behavior disorder is common and can precede cognitive symptoms. REM sleep behavior disorder may occur but is primarily linked to motor symptoms. Progression Rapid progression of cognitive and behavioral symptoms. Gradual progression of motor symptoms, with cognitive decline developing later. Pathology: Lewy body disease presents clinically similarly to Alzheimer’s disease but is marked by hallucinations, parkinsonian features, and extrapyramidal signs. Lewy bodies, which are abnormal accumulations of α -synuclein aggregates , are found in the cerebral cortex and substantia nigra . In cases where Lewy body pathology coexists with Alzheimer’s, the amygdala is often the only affected region. Patients with Lewy body dementia may exhibit Capgras syndrome (reduplicative paramnesia), highlighting the complex nature of their symptoms. Lewy bodies",

      "correct_answer": "D",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: D) Pick’s Disease Explanation: Pick’s Disease is characterized by early personality and behavioral changes, including disinhibition, lack of empathy, and hyperorality , while other cognitive functions remain intact initially. The patient’s age and family history of similar symptoms further support this diagnosis. The behavioral variant of frontotemporal dementia aligns closely with the symptoms presented. Frontotemporal Dementia (Pick Disease): Affects frontotemporal regions with atrophy. Involves neuronal loss, gliosis, and Pick bodies (not needed for diagnosis). Accounts for about 5% of irreversible dementias. More common in men, especially with a family history. Early symptoms include personality and behavioral changes; other cognitive functions are preserved. Typically begins before age 75; familial cases may start earlier. Features like hypersexuality and hyperorality are more common than in Alzheimer’s disease. Difficult to distinguish from Alzheimer’s in early stages.

      "explanation": "Correct Answer: C) Stepwise deterioration in cognitive abilities over time. Explanation: The stepwise deterioration in cognitive abilities is a hallmark of vascular dementia, particularly as seen in patients with a history of TIAs and small vessel disease, which this patient exhibits. Vascular Dementia: Vascular dementia, previously known as multi-infarct dementia, is caused by multiple areas of cerebral vascular disease. Most common in men, especially those with hypertension or cardiovascular risk factors. Affects small- and medium-sized cerebral vessels, leading to infarctions and parenchymal lesions. Causes of infarctions include arteriosclerotic plaques or thromboemboli from distant sources (e.g., heart valves).

Explanation: The twilight state is characterized by disturbed consciousness with unexpected violent acts, while the oneroid state involves a more dream-like, less interactive experience. Twilight state: Disturbed consciousness with hallucinations. Onset/end- Abrupt Episodes of unexpected violent acts/ emotional outbursts. Seen in cases of epilepsy, brain tumors, and head injury. Dream-like (oneiroid) state: Impairment of consciousness Dream-like experiences : Vivid, surreal perceptions resembling a dream, often with hallucinations or delusions. Disorientation : Difficulty distinguishing reality from the dream-like mental state. Fluctuating consciousness : Periods of clarity mixed with deep confusion. Detachment : Reduced interaction with the environment, as the individual is absorbed in internal, fantasy-like experiences.

        "D": "Presenilin-2"
      },
      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: C) APOE gene Explanation: The patient’s clinical features—progressive memory loss, difficulties in planning and organizing tasks, and issues with conversation—strongly point to a diagnosis of Alzheimer’s disease. Given her age and the nature of her symptoms, this suggests early-onset Alzheimer's disease (EOAD). The APOE gene , particularly the ε 4 allele, is a key risk factor for late-onset Alzheimer's disease (LOAD) rather than early-onset. Alzheimer’s Disease Cognitive Changes : Starts with memory impairment, progressing to executive function, language, and visuospatial deficits. Recognizable memory loss, with about 50% progressing to Alzheimer’s within four years. Biomarkers can indicate amyloid pathology up to 20 years before symptoms. Late Stage Symptoms : Wandering, loss of judgment, delusions, sleep-wake pattern changes, and parkinsonian features. Typical course lasts 8-10 years, but can range from 1 to 25 years; memory impairment is a key feature. Epidemiology: Seen in females more than males. Genetics: Early-Onset Alzheimer's Disease (EOAD) Late-Onset Alzheimer's Disease (LOAD) APP gene (chromosome 21): Associated with early-onset familial Alzheimer's disease (FAD) and Down's syndrome. (Option A ruled out) Presenilin-1 (PSEN-1) : Most common cause (40-70%), mean onset at 45 years, rapid progression (6-7 years) (Option B ruled out) . Presenilin-2 (PSEN-2) : Less common, mean onset at 53 years, slower progression (11 years). (Option D ruled out) Pathogenesis involves mutations that increase A β 42 levels and amyloid accumulation. APOE gene (chromosome 19) is a key risk factor. ApoE ε 4 allele : Increases risk and lowers age of onset (about 10 years per allele). ApoE ε 2 allele : May reduce risk. Risk varies by ethnicity; higher in East Asians, lower in Blacks and Hispanics. Polygenic Risk : Additional genes (e.g., CLU, PICALM, CR1) involved, with smaller individual effects. Variants in TREM2 significantly increase AD risk (odds ratios 3-4).

This deficiency can lead to neuropsychiatric symptoms, including memory loss, irritability, and cognitive impairment. The pathophysiology involves the disruption of myelin synthesis and subsequent demyelination , which affects both the central and peripheral nervous systems. Types of Dementia: Degenerative dementias Alzheimer disease Frontotemporal dementias (e.g., Pick disease) Parkinson disease Lewy body dementia Idiopathic cerebral ferrocalcinosis (Fahr disease) Progressive supranuclear palsy Limbic predominant age-related TDP-43 encephalopathy (LATE) Miscellaneous Huntington disease Wilson disease Metachromatic leukodystrophy Neuroacanthocytosis Psychiatric Pseudodementia of depression Cognitive decline in late-life schizophrenia Demyelinating diseases Multiple sclerosis Cardiac, vascular, and anoxia Infarction (single or multiple or strategic lacunar) Binswanger disease (subcortical arteriosclerotic encephalopathy) Hemodynamic insufficiency (e.g., hypoperfusion or hypoxia) Physiologic Normal pressure hydrocephalus Metabolic Vitamin deficiencies (e.g., vitamin B12, folate) Endocrinopathies (e.g., hypothyroidism) Chronic metabolic disturbances (e.g., uremia) Tumor Primary or metastatic (e.g., meningioma or metastatic breast or lung cancer) Traumatic Dementia pugilistica, posttraumatic dementia Subdural hematoma Infection Prion diseases (e.g., Creutzfeldt–Jakob disease, bovine spongiform encephalitis, Gerstmann–Sträussler syndrome) Acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) Syphilis Drugs and toxins Alcohol Heavy metals Irradiation Cognitive dysfunction due to medications (e.g., anticholinergics) Carbon monoxide Some types of dementia can be attributable to reversible causes, such as metabolic abnormalities (e.g., hypothyroidism), nutritional deficiencies (e.g., vitamin B12 or folate deficiencies), normal pressure hydrocephalus or dementia syndrome caused by depression. Dementia is classified based on the brain structures involved into following 2 types: Cortical Dementia: Involves the cerebral cortex , leading to impairments in memory, language, and higher cognitive",

      "explanation": "Correct Answer: C) Rapid onset and fluctuation of symptoms Explanation: Rapid onset and fluctuation of symptoms is NOT typical of dementia but is more characteristic of delirium, which is an acute, fluctuating disturbance in attention and cognition. Dementia/Major Neurocognitive Disorder is characterized by a progressive decline in cognitive abilities , (Option A) which involves the impairment of at least one (usually two or more) cognitive domains such as: Memory (Option B) Attention Executive function Language Perceptual-motor abilities Social cognition Etiology: Dementia can be caused by several underlying conditions, including: Alzheimer’s Disease Vascular Dementia Dementia with Lewy Bodies Frontotemporal Dementia Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI) HIV-associated Dementia Prion Diseases Parkinson’s Disease Huntington’s Disease Epidemiology: With the aging population, dementia has become increasingly common, especially in older adults. Approximately 5% of individuals over the age of 65 suffer from moderate to severe dementia The prevalence rises sharply in the elderly, affecting 20-40% of individuals over the age of 85 Alzheimer’s disease is the most common cause, alone or in combination with other etiologies, accounts for about 70% to 80% of dementias. Dementia with Lewy Bodies (DLB) is characterized by the same neuropathologic changes as Alzheimer disease, with neurofibrillary tangles and plaques, plus Lewy bodies in cortical and brain stem regions, and accounts for about 15% to 35% of dementias. Vascular disease, both small vessel and large vessel disease affecting cortical or subcortical regions accounts for about 5% to 20% of dementias. It associated with risk factors like hypertension and cerebrovascular disease Other causes of dementia, such as those related to alcohol, head trauma, and movement disorders like Huntington’s and Parkinson’s diseases, each represent around 1-5% of cases Symptoms: Dementia presents with a broad range of cognitive and behavioral symptoms, which may vary based on the underlying cause but generally include: Memory Impairment Early signs include difficulty recalling recent events, conversations, or tasks (e.g., forgetting appointments, misplacing items). Over time, even long-term memories may be lost , and patients may forget personal details like their birthplace or the names of close relatives. Impaired Attention and Executive Functioning Patients struggle with tasks requiring planning, decision-making, and problem-solving.

      "explanation": "Correct Answer: C) Rule out metabolic and infectious causes Explanation: This patient presents with typical clinical features of delirium , including acute onset, fluctuating course, disorientation, hallucinations, and altered attention. Delirium is a common condition in hospitalized elderly patients and is often secondary to underlying medical issues such as infections, metabolic imbalances, or medication side effects. The primary step in managing delirium is to identify and treat the underlying cause , which in this case could include pneumonia or other metabolic disturbances. Assessment : Delirium is assessed primarily through clinical observation and mental status examinations . Specific tools for assessment: The Confusion Assessment Method (CAM) is commonly used to diagnose delirium based on four features: acute onset, fluctuating course, inattention, and disorganized thinking or altered consciousness. The Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) can help document cognitive impairments and establish a baseline to monitor changes over time I . Physical and Neurological Examination : Common findings include: Fever (suggestive of infection), tachycardia (metabolic disturbances or hyperthyroidism), or bradycardia (intracranial pressure, hypothyroidism). Neurological signs : Tremor, asterixis, incoordination, nystagmus, and reflex abnormalities (e.g., Babinski sign) may point toward neurological causes. Laboratory and Imaging Workup : Laboratory tests help to rule out metabolic causes: Blood chemistries (electrolytes, renal and hepatic function, glucose levels) Complete blood count (to detect infection or anemia) Thyroid function tests Toxicology screens (for substance-induced delirium) If indicated, imaging studies such as CT or MRI are performed to rule out structural brain lesions. EEG may be done to differentiate delirium from other psychiatric conditions, as it often shows diffuse slowing in delirium I . Treatment : The treatment of delirium has two major components: addressing the underlying cause and providing symptomatic relief . Treating the underlying cause : Identifying and reversing the underlying cause is the most important step. Causes can range from infections (such",

      "explanation": "Correct Answer: C) Delirium Explanation: Delirium is a life-threatening but potentially reversible disorder that involves an acute decline in attention, awareness, and cognition , often triggered by medical conditions, medications, or substance withdrawal. Neurochemical and Neuroanatomical Basis of Delirium: Decreased Ach The major neuroanatomical area involved is the reticular formation which regulates attention and arousal The major pathway implicated is the dorsal tegmental pathway , which projects from the mesencephalic reticular formation to the tectum and thalamus. Clinical Features and Clinical Diagnosis of Delirium: Delirium is characterized by an acute onset of altered consciousness and cognitive impairment, with a hallmark feature being impaired attention. It often presents with abnormalities of mood, perception, and behavior. Common clinical features include: Fluctuating course : Symptoms tend to wax and wane, and the patient may have periods of lucidity followed by severe cognitive disorganization. Impaired attention : Patients have difficulty focusing, sustaining, or shifting attention. Cognitive dysfunctions: These include disorientation (especially to time and place), memory impairment, and disturbances in language and perception. Motor disturbances: Hyperactive or Hypoactive Mood and behavioral changes: Abnormalities in mood (such as agitation or lethargy) and perception (hallucinations or delusions) are frequent. Sleep disturbances: Decreased sleep, reversal of sleep-wake cycle. Neurological signs: Tremors, asterixis, nystagmus, and incoordination may be observed. Sundowning - symptoms worsen at night. Course: Acute : hours to days Persistent : weeks to months Diagnosis is primarily clinical , with a focus on history and mental status examination. The Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) can be utilized to assess cognitive impairment and establish a baseline to monitor the patient's clinical course. The Confusion Assessment Method (CAM) is used for diagnosing delirium that involves the presence of Acute onset and fluctuating course, Inattention, and Disorganized thinking Altered level of consciousness. A positive diagnosis is made if features 1 and 2 are present, along with either feature 3 or feature 4. Additionally, an EEG may show diffuse slowing, which helps distinguish delirium from psychiatric disorders like depression or psychosis.

Fluctuating levels of consciousness are a hallmark of delirium. Patients often exhibit periods of confusion and altered awareness that can change throughout the day. It develops quickly and has a fluctuating course with lucid intervals (waxing and waning) Delirium is an acute decline in both the level of consciousness and cognition with particular impairment in attention. A life-threatening yet potentially reversible disorder of the central nervous system (CNS), delirium often involves perceptual disturbances, abnormal psychomotor activity, and sleep cycle impairment. Abnormalities of mood, perception, and behavior are common psychiatric symptoms. Tremor, asterixis, nystagmus, incoordination, and urinary incontinence are common neurologic symptoms. Classically, delirium has a sudden onset (hours or days), a brief and fluctuating course, and rapid improvement when we can identify the cause and eliminate it, but each of these characteristic features can vary in individual patients.
