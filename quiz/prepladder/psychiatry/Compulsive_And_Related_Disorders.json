      "question": "A 23-year-old female presents with complaints of sudden episodes of intense fear and discomfort. She reports palpitations, shortness of breath, chest tightness, and tremors during these episodes. They occur unpredictably and last for 20–30 minutes. She has been free of symptoms between attacks. Her mother had a similar condition in her teens. Vitals are within normal limits, and ECG is unremarkable. Which of the following medications can help her during the acute attacks?",

      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "disorder based on the clinical presentation. Clonazepam is a benzodiazepine that is highly effective for acute management of panic attacks due to its rapid onset of action. They are not recommended for long-term use due to the risk of dependency. Panic Disorder It is the recurrent acute intense attack of anxiety accompanied by a feeling of impending doom. More common in females than males. Median age of onset: late adolescence or early adulthood. Familial risk: Highest for early-onset panic disorder. Patients with panic disorder presents commonly with agoraphobia Panic attacks for more than a month are termed as a Panic disorder. Neurotransmitters that are implicated in the development of panic disorders are norepinephrine, Serotonin, GABA, and Cholecystokinin. Symptoms: Panic attacks Unexpected i.e., not restricted to any particular situation. Usually last for 20 to 30 minutes, rarely they may last more than one hour. Cardiopulmonary Feeling short of breath Palpitations Chest discomfort Gastrointestinal Nausea GI discomfort Skin and systemic Sweating Chills Feeling flushed Neurologic Tremors Dizziness Numbness and tingling sensation Psychiatric Derealization Depersonalization Fear of losing control Fear of dying Symptoms are random and unpredictable.

      "question": "A 42-year-old woman reports that for the past year, she has been experiencing severe anxiety whenever she leaves her home alone and while using public transport. She fears that if she experiences dizziness or shortness of breath, she will not be able to find help. Due to this fear, she has been unable to visit friends, shop, or attend social events without a companion. She has never had a panic attack. What is the most likely diagnosis?",

      "correct_answer": "D",
      "explanation": "condition defined by marked fear or anxiety about being in situations where escape might be difficult or help might not be available in the event of developing panic-like or incapacitating symptoms (e.g., dizziness, shortness of breath). Key features from the case: Fear of leaving home alone Avoidance of public settings (e.g., shopping, visiting friends, attending events) Requires a companion to feel safe No history of panic attacks (which rules out panic disorder) Agoraphobia can occur with or without panic disorder . In this case, her fear is anticipatory (fear of what might happen), not a response to actual panic attacks. Agoraphobia – Diagnostic Criteria Highlights (DSM-5): Criterion Description Fear/anxiety about ≥ 2 situations e.g., using public transport, open spaces, enclosed places, standing in line or being in a crowd, being outside the home alone Thoughts Escape might be difficult or help unavailable Behavior Actively avoided or endured with intense fear or only with a companion Duration Typically ≥ 6 months Not better explained by another condition e.g., social anxiety or specific phobia Treatment: Pharmacological, psychological, and combined treatments. Psychological therapies: Behavioral therapy: For rapid and complete reduction of agoraphobia, such as systematic desensitization, graded exposure. Cognitive Behavioral therapy Virtual therapy Relaxation techniques Pharmacotherapy: Limited role. Used to treat comorbid conditions like panic disorder. SSRIs, along with Benzodiazepines (short-term). Panic Disorder (Option A): Characterized by recurrent, unexpected panic attacks and persistent concern about having future attacks lasting more than a month. Patients often develop anticipatory anxiety and behavioral changes, such as avoiding places where attacks have previously occurred. In this case, the primary concern is about avoiding situations due to fear of panic attacks, not recurrent panic attacks themselves. This option is incorrect. Specific Phobia (Option B): Specific phobia refers to an intense fear of a particular object or situation (e.g., heights, animals, flying). The avoidance behavior in this case is not related to a specific object but to broader situations where escape might be difficult, which is more characteristic of agoraphobia. This option is incorrect. Social anxiety disorder (Option C): It involves an intense fear of being judged or embarrassed in social or performance situations. The avoidance behavior in this case is not",

      },
      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "exposure therapy is the most effective treatment for specific phobias, including blood phobia (hemophobia). In exposure therapy, the individual is gradually exposed to the feared object or situation in a safe, controlled manner, helping to reduce the intensity of the fear response over time. Specific phobias Strong, persistent, irrational fear of a specific object/situation. Specific phobia is the persistence of this fear for 6 months or more. Symptoms: Exposure to the object/situation causes immediate fear, panic, and/or anxiety. Avoidance behaviors: of the object or situation. The fear/anxiety is out of proportion to the likely threat.

Techniques to deal with anxiety - relaxation and breathing control. The patients keep moving up the scale until the most anxiety-provoking stimuli no longer elicit any fear or anxiety (Desensitized). Flooding (Implosion): Increasing exposure to the stimulus to induce habituation and decrease anxiety- no longer preferred. Virtual therapy Hypnosis Supportive therapy Family therapy Pharmacological therapy: Treat comorbid conditions. For example, beta-blockers and benzodiazepines for panic attacks. Serotonin-Norepinephrine reuptake Inhibitor (SNRI) (Option B): They are used in treating generalized anxiety disorders, depression, and panic disorders, but they are not first-line treatments for specific phobias. Medications are generally not as effective for treating specific phobias as psychotherapy, particularly exposure-based techniques. This option is incorrect. Short-term benzodiazepines (Option C): They can be used for temporary relief of acute anxiety in phobia-related situations, but they are not considered a long-term treatment or",

It is crucial to evaluate for depression in these patients, as the first line of treatment for patients of OCD with depression is pharmacotherapy. Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder Patient has recurrent obsessions and compulsions. Recurrent obsessions or compulsions may cause severe distress or anxiety to the person. Obsessions Compulsions Intrusive and unwanted repetitive thoughts, urges, or impulses. Most common: Contamination Repetitive actions or thoughts carried out in a strict, regulation-bound manner or reaction to obsessions Performed to relieve anxiety or fear. Most common: Checking These are time-consuming (at least 1 hr/day) and significantly interfere with the person’s routine, occupational functioning, usual social activities, or relationships. Patients can have only obsessions, only compulsions, or both obsessions and compulsions (most common). Most common comorbidity associated with OCD is major depressive disorder (67%). (Option B) Major symptom patterns: Contamination / Cleansing Most common presentation. An obsession with contamination followed by washing and avoidance of the presumably contaminated object. Pathological doubt /checking Second most common presentation. Obsession of doubt, usually followed by compulsion of checking. Intrusive/forbidden thoughts Third most common presentation. Obsessed with intrusive thoughts of aggressive or sexual acts without a compulsion. Symmetry/ordering Fourth most common presentation. Patient needs symmetry/precision which results in the compulsion of slowness. Other symptoms Religious obsessions and compulsive hoarding. Epidemiology: Lifetime prevalence- 2 to 3%. More common in females than males (Adolescents M>F). Mean age of onset in OCD is 19 years, early onset is more in males. Etiology: OCD has been linked to the striatum, orbitofrontal cortex, anterior cingulate, and corticostriatal–thalamic–cortical (CSTC) circuit. Neurotransmitters implicated are neurotransmitter systems that contribute to OCD, including serotonergic, dopaminergic, glutamatergic, and GABAergic systems.

      "explanation": "Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (C-PTSD) is a diagnosis used to describe the symptoms that arise from prolonged or repeated exposure to traumatic events, particularly in the context of relationships, such as childhood abuse or neglect or other repetitive events from which escape is difficult or impossible (e.g. torture, slavery, genocide campaigns, prolonged domestic violence) In this scenario, the man's history of ongoing trauma during childhood, along with his emotional regulation difficulties, feelings of hopelessness, and problems in relationships, aligns with the characteristics of C-PTSD. Complex PTSD has been newly recognized in ICD-11 as a separate entity Occurs after repeated severe stressors such as torture, intimate partner abuse, sexual violence, domestic violence Diagnosed similar to PTSD Additional symptoms of: Poor emotional regulation Diminished self-belief difficulties in sustaining relationships and in feeling close to others Significant social, family, educational, and occupational impairment Treatment: Trauma-focused cognitive behavioral therapy eye movement desensitization and reprocessing Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) (Option A) : Would be more applicable if the individual had a single traumatic event without the additional complexities of emotional regulation and interpersonal issues commonly seen in C-PTSD. Acute Stress Disorder (Option C) : This diagnosis is made when symptoms arise shortly after a traumatic event and last for at least three days but less than a month. Generalized Anxiety Disorder (Option D) : This involves excessive worry about various aspects of life that are not directly related to a traumatic event.

      "options": {
        "A": "Major Depressive Disorder",
        "B": "Generalized Anxiety Disorder",
        "C": "Adjustment Disorder",
        "D": "Acute Stress Disorder"
      },
      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "development of emotional or behavioral symptoms in response to a specific stressor, such as a significant life change, within three months of its onset. In this scenario, the woman's difficulties adapting to her new job and city, along with her feelings of anxiety, sadness, and social withdrawal, align with the symptoms of adjustment disorder. Adjustment disorders: Definition Excessively distressing emotional or behavioral symptoms that occur in response to a stressor Stressors are mild to moderate such as: financial, medical, or relationship issues Symptoms Low mood and tearfulness Anxiety Aggression Symptoms lead to impairment and poor functioning Occur within 3 months of the stressor and usually resolve within 6 months of the resolution of the stressor Common in hospitalised patients Differentials Depression Generalized anxiety disorder Post-traumatic stress disorder Treatment Psychotherapy- group therapy, CBT Crisis intervention Pharmacotherapy with SSRIs and anxiolytics are not typically employed Major Depressive Disorder (Option A): This diagnosis requires the presence of more pervasive and persistent symptoms, such as anhedonia (loss of interest in pleasurable activities) and significant impairment over a longer duration with/ without a clear external stressor. Generalized Anxiety Disorder (Option B): This involves excessive worry about various aspects of life that is not necessarily linked to a specific stressor and lasts for at least six months. Acute Stress Disorder (Option D): This is diagnosed when symptoms arise within three days to one month after a traumatic event, which does not apply to this scenario.
