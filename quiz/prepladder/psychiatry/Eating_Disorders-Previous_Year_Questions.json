      "question": "A young female has episodes of binge eating followed by self-induced vomiting. Which of the following acid- base disturbace is she likely to have?",
      "options": {
        "A": "Respiratory acidosis",
        "B": "Respiratory alkalosis",
        "C": "Metabolic acidosis",
        "D": "Metabolic alkalosis"
      },
      "correct_answer": "D",
      "explanation": "bulimia nervosa . Recurrent vomiting leads to loss of gastric acid (HCl) , resulting in hypochloremic metabolic alkalosis . This occurs because: Loss of hydrogen ions (H I ) through vomiting leads to an increase in blood pH (alkalosis) . Loss of chloride (Cl I ) contributes to hypochloremia , which further impairs bicarbonate (HCO II ) excretion, worsening alkalosis . Hypokalemia often accompanies metabolic alkalosis due to renal compensation , where the kidneys excrete more H I in exchange for potassium (K I ). Binge Eating Episodes Recurring episodes of binge eating, occurring at least weekly for the last 3 months. Compensatory Behaviors Purging behaviors (self-induced vomiting, laxative abuse, diuretics), excessive exercise. BMI Often normal or slightly overweight (compared to anorexia nervosa). Physical Signs Parotid gland hypertrophy (may see increased serum amylase) Enamel erosion (from vomiting) Mallory-Weiss syndrome (esophageal tears) These signs appear due to repeated purging. Electrolyte Disturbances Commonly hypokalemia and hypochloremia. Metabolic Changes Metabolic alkalosis due to vomiting. Physical Findings Dorsal hand calluses from induced vomiting (Russell sign). Other Options: Respiratory acidosis (Option A): This occurs due to hypoventilation (e.g., in chronic lung disease), leading to CO I retention and a drop in pH . Vomiting does not cause respiratory acidosis. Respiratory alkalosis (Option B) : Caused by hyperventilation (e.g., anxiety, panic attacks) leading to excess CO I loss , but vomiting does not affect breathing. Metabolic acidosis (Option C): Seen in conditions such as diarrhea, diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA), or renal failure , where there is an excess loss of bicarbonate (HCO II ) or acid buildup. Vomiting removes acid rather than increasing it , making metabolic acidosis unlikely.",

      "question": "A mother presented her daughter with complaints that she has started behaving weirdly about her food habits for the last few months. She eats a lot of burgers in one go, and then she vomits it out. Her BMI is 27. What is the most probable diagnosis?",
      "options": {
        "A": "Anorexia nervosa",
        "B": "Binge eating disorder",
        "C": "Bulimia nervosa",
        "D": "OCD"
      },
      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: C) Bulimia nervosa Explanation: The patient exhibits binge eating followed by vomiting, which is characteristic of Bulimia nervosa (eating disorder) . Bulimia Nervosa (eating disorder) Age of Onset Late adolescence and young adulthood (8-21 years). Features Binge Eating Episodes: Recurring episodes of binge eating, occurring at least weekly for the last 3 months. Compensatory Behaviors: Purging behaviours (self-induced vomiting, laxative abuse, diuretics), excessive exercise, fasting. BMI: Often normal or slightly overweight (compared to anorexia nervosa). Gender prevalence: More common in females than males. Physical signs Appear due to repeated purging. Parotitis or (parotid gland hypertrophy (may see increased serum amylase) Enamel erosion (from vomiting) Dental caries Mallory-Weiss syndrome (esophageal tears). Russell's Sign (callus on knuckles: Due to self-induced vomiting, the knuckles get injured by the teeth. Treatment Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT): First-line treatment focuses on modifying distorted thoughts and behaviours related to eating and body image. Nutritional Rehabilitation: Aimed at restoring healthy eating patterns and addressing nutritional deficiencies. Antidepressants Fluoxetine: Most effective medication for reducing binge-eating episodes and associated symptoms. Topiramate: This can be effective in suppressing binge eating but not as commonly used as fluoxetine. Bupropion: Contraindicated due to an increased risk of seizures, especially in patients with eating disorders. Evidence indicates that CBT and medications (particularly fluoxetine) are the most effective combination. Incorrect Options: Anorexia nervosa (Option A) involves an intense fear of gaining weight and a distorted body image, as seen in the patient's anxiety over gaining a few pounds. It also includes behaviours like binge eating followed by purging, such as self-induced vomiting, but with a decreased BMI . Binge eating disorder (Option B) does not involve purging behaviours and is characterised by episodes of eating large quantities of food without compensatory actions. OCD (Obsessive Compulsive Disorder) (Option D) is not an eating disorder. It is characterised by persistent, unwanted thoughts (obsessions) and repetitive behaviours (compulsions) performed to reduce anxiety. Individuals often feel compelled to engage in these actions despite recognising them as irrational.",

      "question": "SCOFF criteria is used as a screening tool for which of the following disorders?",
      "options": {
        "A": "Eating disorder",
        "B": "Sexual disorder",
        "C": "Alcohol use disorder",
        "D": "Schizophrenia"
      },
      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer A - Eating disorder The SCOFF Criteria are primarily used as a screening tool for eating disorders, including anorexia nervosa, bulimia nervosa, and binge eating disorder. The five questions are related to key symptoms and behaviours commonly seen in individuals with eating disorders, such as a distorted body image, a preoccupation with weight, and loss of control over eating. The SCOFF questionnaire comprises the following inquiries: S - Do you make yourself Sick (vomit) because you feel uncomfortably full? C - Do you worry you have lost Control over how much you eat? O - Have you recently lost more than One stone in a 3-month period? F - Do you believe yourself to be Fat when others say you are too thin? F - Would you say that Food dominates your life? One point for every “yes”; a score of ≥ 2 indicates a likely case of anorexia nervosa or bulimia. Sexual disorders (Option B) encompass a range of conditions that affect a person's sexual thoughts, desires, or behaviours. The SCOFF criteria are not designed to assess or evaluate these types of disorders. Alcohol use disorder (Option C) refers to a problematic pattern of alcohol consumption leading to significant impairment or distress. While screening tools do exist for alcohol use disorder, including the AUDIT (Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test) and the CAGE questionnaire the SCOFF criteria are not among them. Schizophrenia (Option D) is a complex mental disorder, characterised by symptoms such as hallucinations, delusions, disorganised thinking, and impaired social functioning. The SCOFF criteria are specific to screening for eating disorders and do not assess symptoms related to schizophrenia.

      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "dissociative disorder characterized by persistent or recurrent episodes of depersonalization, where individuals feel detached from themselves and their experiences. It is often associated with significant distress and impairment in daily functioning. While the exact cause of depersonalization disorder is unclear, it is commonly observed that it can be triggered or exacerbated by traumatic experiences, including life-threatening events. Incorrect Options: Options B - Seen in seizure and migraine patients: Depersonalization disorder is not specifically associated with seizure or migraine patients. It is a distinct psychiatric condition unrelated to these neurological disorders. Options C - More common in females: Depersonalization disorder does not show a significant gender bias. It can affect both males and females equally. Options D - Mean age at onset is 25 years: The age of onset for depersonalization disorder can vary, and there is no specific mean age at onset. It can occur at any age, but it often manifests during adolescence or early adulthood. Reference: Prepladder Notes",

      "question": "What should be done if a patient with anorexia nervosa follows the recommended diet chart but shows no weight change after one week ?",
      "options": {
        "A": "Observe the patient for 2 hours post meal",
        "B": "Ask the psychiatrist to prescribe anti-anxiety medication",
        "C": "Increase the calories from 1500 to 2000 in her diet",
        "D": "Increase water intake"
      },
      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "nervosa who is following a prescribed diet chart but not experiencing weight changes after one week, it is important to monitor the patient closely for a period after meals. This observation allows healthcare providers to assess the patient's behaviour, including any signs of purging or excessive exercise that may be affecting their weight. Incorrect Options: Option B - Asking the psychiatrist to prescribe anti-anxiety medication: While anxiety may be a common comorbidity in anorexia nervosa, it is not the appropriate first step in addressing the lack of weight change. Anxiety medication alone does not directly address the issue of weight gain, and it is essential to rule out other factors before considering medication options. Option C - Increasing the calories from 1500 to 2000 in her diet: Increasing calorie intake without understanding the underlying cause of the lack of weight change may not be the most appropriate step. It is important to assess the patient's behaviour and rule out any compensatory behaviours or medical factors that may be affecting weight before making changes to the diet plan. Option D - Increasing water intake: While adequate hydration is important for overall health, increasing water intake alone is unlikely to address the lack of weight change in this scenario. It is crucial to evaluate the patient comprehensively and focus on potential behavioural factors or medical conditions that may be impacting weight. Reference: Prepladder Notes",

      "question": "What will be your next course of action upon noticing multiple cigarette burns on the forearm of a 14-year-old girl who has presented to the emergency room with a fractured forearm and claims to have tripped and fallen ?",
      "options": {
        "A": "Conduct a thorough examination",
        "B": "Seek a social worker’s help",
        "C": "Inform higher authorities immediately",
        "D": "Inform your colleagues"
      },
      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "the most appropriate next step. As a healthcare professional, it is crucial to conduct a thorough examination of the patient to assess the extent of their injuries, including the fractured forearm and the presence of multiple cigarette burns. This examination will help determine the severity of the injuries, provide necessary medical treatment, and identify any additional signs of abuse or neglect. Incorrect Options: Option B - Seek a social worker's help: Seeking the assistance of a social worker is an important step in cases involving potential child abuse or neglect. Social workers are trained professionals who specialize in addressing such situations. They can provide support, resources, and interventions to ensure the safety and well-being of the child. In many healthcare settings, there are designated professionals who can be called upon to assist in cases involving suspected abuse or neglect. Option C - Inform higher authorities immediately: While it is important to address the situation promptly, informing higher authorities immediately might not be the first step. The immediate focus should be on providing medical care and conducting a thorough examination of the patient. However, if during the examination there are clear signs of abuse or neglect, it is essential to report the situation to the appropriate authorities in accordance with the established protocols and legal requirements in your jurisdiction. This may include contacting child protective services or law enforcement. Option D - Inform your colleagues: While it can be helpful to discuss the case with colleagues, especially if they have experience or expertise in child protection, it should not be the first step in this scenario. The priority is to ensure the immediate safety and medical care of the patient through a thorough examination and, if necessary, involving a social worker or appropriate authorities.
