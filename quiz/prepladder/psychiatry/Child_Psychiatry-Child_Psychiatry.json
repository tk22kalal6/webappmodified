      "question": "A 10 year old girl is brought to the clinic with concerns about her frequent eye-blinking, shoulder-shrugging and vocalizations that started at age 5. Her symptoms have worsened over the past year, leading to social difficulties and bullying at school. What is the most appropriate initial treatment approach for this child?",
      "options": {
        "A": "Cognitive Behavioral Therapy",
        "B": "Psychoeducation for Family and School",
        "C": "Typical Antipsychotics like Haloperidol",
        "D": "Noradrenergic Agents like Clonidine"
      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: B) Psychoeducation for Family and School Explanation: The child is likely experiencing Tourette Syndrome, characterised by the presence of both motor (eye-blinking, shoulder-shrugging) and vocal tics that began before age 18. Psychoeducation is an appropriate initial treatment approach as it helps the family and school understand the condition, reducing stress and misinterpretations, which can improve the child's social interactions. Tourette Syndrome Definition : Neuropsychiatric disorder characterized by motor and vocal tics, usually emerging in childhood. Onset & Course : Age: Tics begin between 4-6 years, and peak at 10-12 years. Waxing and waning tics, with possible remission periods. Pathophysiology : Basal ganglia dysfunction, particularly dopaminergic transmission in cortico-striatothalamic circuits. Diagnosis : Both motor and vocal tics for over 1 year, onset before 18. Motor tics typically start in the face & neck, and progress downward. Indications for Treatment : Severe tics causing social or emotional issues, physical discomfort, or academic problems. Treatment Psychoeducation Educating families and schools to reduce stress and avoid misinterpretation of tics. Behavioural Therapy Habit Reversal Training (HRT): Most effective and currently the first-line behavioural treatment for tic disorders Exposure and Response Prevention (ERP): Prolonged tic suppression. Pharmacotherapy Atypical Antipsychotics : Risperidone (most studied), Aripiprazole (fewer side effects). Typical Antipsychotics : Haloperidol, Pimozide (higher risk of side effects). Noradrenergic Agents : Clonidine, Guanfacine (modest efficacy, useful with ADHD). Other: Tetrabenazine, Topiramate, THC (understudy) Supportive Approaches Relaxation training, biofeedback, SSRIs for OCD. Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) (Option A): While CBT can be helpful, the initial approach should focus on education to manage misconceptions about tics. Typical Antipsychotics like Haloperidol (Option C): These are generally reserved for cases where tics cause significant distress, making them a secondary option after psychoeducation. Noradrenergic Agents like Clonidine (Option D) : These agents can be considered later, especially if there is comorbid ADHD, but they are not the first line in this scenario.

      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: A) Simple Motor and Simple Vocal Tics Explanation: Shoulder-shrugging (simple motor) and grunting (simple vocal) are both rapid, brief, and uncomplicated tics. Tic Disorders and Types of Tics Definition : Tic disorders are neuropsychiatric conditions marked by brief, rapid involuntary motor movements or vocalizations, often triggered by irresistible urges. Pathophysiology : Involves dysfunction in the basal ganglia and disrupted dopaminergic transmission within the cortico-striatothalamic circuits. Age of Onset : Tics typically emerge between ages 5-6, peaking in severity from ages 10-12. Course : Tics may be transient or chronic, exhibiting a waxing and waning pattern. Types of Tics : Motor Tics Involuntary movements Simple Motor Tics Rapid contractions of specific muscle groups (e.g., eye-blinking, head-jerking, shoulder-shrugging). Complex Motor Tics (Options B and D) More purposeful movements (e.g., grooming behaviours, jumping, touching objects). Vocal Tics Involuntary Vocalizations Simple Vocal Tics Basic sounds (e.g., throat-clearing, grunting, sniffing), echopraxia (imitation of observed behaviour), and copropraxia (display of obscene gestures). Complex Vocal Tics (Option C) Elaborate phrases or behaviours (e.g., coprolalia - involuntary use of obscene words; palilalia - repeating one’s own words; echolalia - repeating the last heard words from others).

      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: C) Disruptive Mood Dysregulation Disorder Explanation: The scenario presents frequent severe outbursts with chronic irritability between episodes, a hallmark of Disruptive Mood Dysregulation Disorder Disorder Disruptive Mood Dysregulation Disorder (DMDD) Definition Severe, developmentally inappropriate temper outbursts with a persistently irritable or angry mood. Chronic disorder, with a high risk of progression to major depressive disorder, dysthymia, and anxiety. Diagnostic Criteria (DSM-5) Duration: ≥ 12 months, with no symptom-free period exceeding 3 months. Outbursts: Occur ≥ 3 times/week, verbal or physical, out of proportion to the situation. Age: Symptoms start before age 10 but diagnosis is not made before age 6 or after 18. Mood Between Outbursts: Persistently irritable/angry, observable by others. Settings: Symptoms present in at least two settings (home, and school). Epidemiology More common in males (78%) than females (22%). Mean age of onset: 5 to 11 years. Clinical Features Verbal or physical aggression towards people or property. They have persistently irritable moods between outbursts. Impacts social relationships and school performance. Treatment Pharmacologic: SSRIs and stimulants (if pathophysiology resembles unipolar depression or anxiety). Atypical antipsychotics and mood stabilizers (if resemble bipolar disorder). Psychosocial Interventions: Cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT), behavioural psychotherapy. Oppositional Defiant Disorder (Option A): ODD involves defiance and irritability but lacks the explosive temper outbursts characteristic of DMDD. Conduct Disorder (Option B): Conduct disorder involves aggression and violation of others' rights, which are not mentioned in this case. Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (Option D): ADHD is characterised by inattention, hyperactivity, and impulsivity, but not the frequent, severe outbursts seen in DMDD.

        "D": "Family education and counselling"
      },
      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: C) Risperidone to enhance cognitive functioning Explanation: There are no specific medications proven to enhance cognitive functioning in individuals with intellectual disabilities, making this option not part of standard treatment protocols. However, symptomatic treatment for associated features can be given like Risperidone (Antipsychotic) for rage, aggression, and self-injurious behaviours and SSRIs for depression. Aetiology of Mental retardation: Treatment: 1. Prevention Primary Prevention involves actions to eliminate or reduce conditions that lead to intellectual disability, such as screening for PKU and providing a low phenylalanine diet (Option A) . Public education on avoiding alcohol during pregnancy (Option B) . Improving public health policies. Genetic counselling for families with a history of genetic disorders. Secondary Prevention focuses on promptly addressing medical and psychiatric complications to diminish their impact on individuals with intellectual disabilities. Tertiary Prevention aims to minimise the long-term consequences of intellectual disabilities through effective early treatments for hereditary disorders like PKU and hypothyroidism, using dietary control or hormone replacement therapy. 2. Pharmacotherapy For symptomatic treatment. Antipsychotics like aripiprazole and risperidone for aggression, rage, irritability, and self-injurious behaviour. Depression- Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs ). 3. Psychosocial Interventions Educational Interventions: Comprehensive programs for academics, adaptive, social, and vocational skills. Focus on communication and quality of life. Behavioural and Cognitive-Behavioral Interventions: Use of behaviour therapy and positive reinforcement. Cognitive therapy for false beliefs and relaxation. Psychodynamic therapy for family conflicts and anxiety. Family Education (Option D) : Educate families on enhancing competence and managing expectations. Provide ongoing counselling and support. Share current medical information and resources. Social Intervention: Improve social skills and reduce isolation. Programs like the Special Olympics enhance fitness, friendships, and self-esteem.",

      "explanation": "Correct Answer: D) Mixed disorder of scholastic skills Explanation: The child exhibits impairments in reading (difficulty decoding words), written expression (messy writing, omitted punctuation), and mathematics (difficulty with signs and calculations). The combination of these challenges indicates a mixed disorder of scholastic skills. Specific Learning Disorders Neurodevelopmental disorder beginning in early childhood Both heritable and environmental factors like lead poisoning, Fetal Alcohol Syndrome, and in-utero drug exposure are responsible. Persistent difficulty in learning academic skills such as reading, written expression or mathematics. Inconsistent with the intellectual ability of the child. The IQ range is usually normal. Types of Specific Learning Disorders Specific learning disorder with impairment in reading (Dyslexia) Identified in children aged 7-9 years. Difficulty in recognizing words and sounding out words. Slow, inaccurate reading. Poor comprehension. Difficulties with spelling. Specific learning disorder with impairment in written expression (Specific Spelling Disorder/ Dysgraphia ) Poor writing skills. Poor spelling. Errors in grammar and punctuation. Poor handwriting. Specific learning disorder with impairment in mathematics (dyscalculia) Identified in children aged 6-10 years. Difficulty learning numerical. Difficulty remembering signs such as +/ –. Slow, inaccurate calculations. Poor linguistic, perceptual, mathematical, and attention skills. Mixed disorder of scholastic skills Combined impairment of reading, written expressions, and mathematics.

      "explanation": "Correct Answer: B) Risperidone Explanation: Risperidone is FDA-approved for treating irritability in children with ASD and is commonly prescribed for this purpose. Psychopharmacological Interventions of Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASD): 1. Medications for Irritability: Medication Description Risperidone FDA-approved Blocks dopamine and serotonin receptors Side effects: Weight gain, sleepiness. Aripiprazole FDA-approved It is a serotonin and dopamine antagonist (5HT2A and D2), but a partial D2 agonist also. Effective for tantrums and aggression Side effects: Sedation and dizziness. Olanzapine Reduces irritability but is associated with significant weight gain. 2. Medications for Hyperactivity, Impulsivity, and Inattention: Medication Description Methylphenidate (Ritalin) Stimulant for ADHD and ASD; may increase irritability. (Option A) Atomoxetine (Strattera) Non-stimulants are effective for hyperactivity and inattention; side effects include sedation. 3. Medications for Repetitive and Stereotypic Behaviour: Medication Description Antidepressants and Mood Stabilisers Fluoxetine and risperidone may be used in managing repetitive behaviours. (Option D) Quetiapine, Clozapine, Ziprasidone Used for aggression and self-injury; requires monitoring due to side effects. Lithium Used clinically for treating aggressive or self-injurious behaviours when antipsychotic medications are ineffective. Clonidine (Option C) may help with hyperactivity but is not specifically a first-line treatment for irritability in children with ASD.

      "explanation": "Correct Answer: B) Heller's Syndrome Explanation: Heller's Syndrome is characterised by marked regression in multiple areas of development after at least two years of normal development , typically between the ages of 3 and 4. Heller's Syndrome: Also known as childhood disintegrative disorder or disintegrative psychosis classified under Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) in DSM-5. Characteristics: Marked regression in multiple developmental areas after at least two years of normal development. It typically occurs between 3 and 4 years of age. Affected Developmental Domains : Domain Description Language skills Significant loss of previously acquired language abilities Social responsiveness Deterioration in social interactions Play Loss of interest or ability to engage in play Motor skills Regression in gross and fine motor skills Bladder and bowel control Loss of previously established control After regression, children closely resemble those with autistic disorder. Asperger's Syndrome: No longer a separate diagnosis in DSM-5; now classified under ASD. Characterised by: Impaired social relatedness. Repetitive and stereotyped behaviours. No significant language delays or abnormalities. Cognitive development is normal. Asperger's Syndrome (Option A) does not typically involve regression of skills, as it is a form of autism without significant delays in language or cognitive development. Tourette Syndrome (Option C): This condition involves the presence of motor and vocal tics and does not involve regression of previously acquired developmental skills. Rett syndrome (Option D) primarily affects girls and usually presents with stereotypical hand-wringing and loss of motor function, not seen in this case.

      "explanation": "Correct Answer: B) Rett Syndrome Explanation: Rett Syndrome is characterised by normal early development followed by a regression in skills, particularly communication and motor skills, along with stereotypic hand movements. Rett Syndrome: Rett Syndrome is now classified as a form of Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) in the DSM-5. A degenerative condition caused by a dominant X-linked gene (hence seen in females>males) due to mutations in the MECP2 gene. Developmental Progression (Option B): Initial development appears normal in infants till around 6 months of age. After that, there is a loss of acquired skills (e.g., purposeful hand movements, spoken language) often replaced by unusual behaviours (e.g., stereotypical hand-wringing). Symptoms of Rett Syndrome: Ataxia Facial grimacing & Teeth grinding Deterioration of verbal communication Breathing Issues: eg. hyperventilation, apnea, and breath-holding Stereotypical Hand Movements : Eg. hand-wringing and hand-washing behaviours. Gait disturbance leading to the development of scoliosis Seizures (in 75% of the cases) Muscle tone abnormalities: Evolution from hypotonia to spasticity and rigidity Cerebral atrophy Management Trofinitide is a tripeptide approved by the FDA for Rett syndrome. Long-term Prognosis - Generally poor prognosis: May live up to 10 years post-symptom onset. The developmental level typically stalls at that of a child under one-year-old. Usually whee-chair bound. Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) (Option A) : While Rett Syndrome is now classified under ASD, it specifically involves a distinct pattern of regression and additional symptoms not typical of ASD alone. Cerebral Palsy (Option C) : This condition primarily involves motor impairment without the specific regression and stereotypical movements seen in Rett Syndrome. Global Developmental Delay (Option D) refers to delays across multiple developmental domains but doesn't typically include the loss of previously acquired skills.

      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: B) Early development of a social smile Explanation: Children with ASD often lack a social smile during infancy, which indicates deficits in social communication. Physical Symptoms of Autism: Higher rates of minor physical anomalies (e.g., ear malformations). Delayed or lack of handedness and lateralization (prolonged ambidexterity). Abnormal dermatoglyphics (unusual fingerprint patterns). Macrocephaly in >20% of patients (large head size develops by 5 years of age). Behavioural Symptoms of Autism: Symptom Category Examples Social Communication and Interaction Deficits Lack of social smile, poor eye contact (Option B) Atypical attachment behaviour Difficulty with non-verbal communication Challenges in forming and maintaining relationships Awkward or inappropriate social behaviour Restricted and Repetitive Behaviour Patterns Limited exploratory play Repetitive toy use (Option A) Rigid, monotonous activities Strong attachment to objects (Option D) Self-stimulatory or self-injurious behaviours Language Development Disturbances Delays in language development (Option C) Minimal or absent babbling Echolalia (repeating words or phrases) Pronoun reversals Peculiar voice quality and rhythm Hyperlexia (early reading without comprehension) Intellectual Disability Approximately 30% of children with ASD have intellectual disabilities Irritability Aggression, self-injurious behaviours, severe temper tantrums Sudden, unexplained mood swings Atypical Response to Sensory Stimuli Over- or under-responsiveness to sensory input such as sound or pain Hyperactivity and Inattention Common in young children with ASD Precocious Skills Exceptional abilities in specific areas such as rote memory, calculation, or music Reference: Kaplan and Sodock’s Synopsis of Psychiatry, 12th Edition, Page 394-401",

      "question": "A 5 year old child with known Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) exhibits difficulties in understanding social cues and rarely participates in group activities at school. The teacher reports that he often plays by himself, lining up toys in a particular order, and shows little interest in playing with others. What core symptom of ASD is most likely causing his difficulties in social interaction?",
      "options": {
        "A": "Impaired Theory of Mind",
        "B": "Resistance to Change",
        "C": "Delayed Motor Skills",
        "D": "Excessive Aggression"
      },
      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "Correct answer: A) Impaired Theory of Mind Explanation: The child in this case struggles with social cues and prefers to play alone, which aligns with the social deficits linked to an impaired theory of mind . This inability to understand how others are feeling or what they are thinking makes it challenging for them to engage in typical social interactions, resulting in poor social reciprocity and difficulty in making friends. Core Symptoms of Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) Deficits in Social Communication and Interaction Restricted and Repetitive Patterns of Behaviour Reciprocal Social Skills : Difficulty in engaging in back-and-forth social exchanges, may lack typical gestures and eye contact. Attachment Behaviours : Exhibits atypical responses to familiar individuals, showing less emotional expression. Social Cues and Friendships : Difficulty understanding social norms, leading to awkward interactions and trouble making friends. Impaired Theory of Mind: Struggles to recognize or interpret the emotions and intentions of others, hindering empathy and social relationships. Atypical Play Patterns : Engages in repetitive activities rather than imaginative play, and may show rigidity in how toys are used. Ritualistic Behaviours : Tends to perform repetitive actions (e.g., lining up objects) and may form strong attachments to specific items. Resistance to Change : Experiences distress during changes in routine, which can result in anxiety or temper outbursts. (Option B) Aetiology of Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD): Genetic Factors : Highly heritable with higher prevalence in families and monozygotic twins. Specific genes implicated (e.g., related to serotonin and synaptic plasticity). Environmental Factors : Prenatal and perinatal complications (e.g., advanced parental age, low birth weight). Potential link to hypoxia affecting brain development. Other Factors : Possible immunologic factors, though not fully confirmed. Delayed Motor Skills (Option C): Although some children with ASD may have motor skill delays, such as difficulties with coordination or fine motor tasks, the child’s main issue in this case is related to social interaction, not motor development. Excessive Aggression (Option D): Aggressive behaviour can occasionally be observed in children with ASD, but it is not a core feature of the disorder. The child described in this scenario shows social withdrawal and a preference for solitary play, which are more indicative of impaired social communication rather than aggression Reference: Kaplan and Sodock’s Synopsis of Psychiatry, 12th Edition, Page 394-400, 417-421",

      "explanation": "Correct Answer: D) Guanfacine Explanation: Alpha 2 agonists, e.g., Clonidine, Guanfacine, are FDA approved for the treatment of ADHD in children and adolescents. These are non stimulant medications . Their common adverse effects include: Sedation Headache Fatigue Hypotension Preferred in ADHD and comorbid tic disorder when stimulants increase tics. Methylphenidate (Option A) is a CNS stimulant medication and is the drug of choice in ADHD. However, It can exacerbate tics and hence be avoided in children with comorbid tic disorders. Amphetamine (Option B) is also a CNS stimulant medication which is the second drug of choice in ADHD. They can exacerbate tics, therefore avoided in such conditions. Modafinil (Option C) is also a CNS stimulant medication used in the treatment of ADHD but it is not FDA approved.",

      "explanation": "Correct answer: A) Stimulant medications Explanation: Stimulant medications, such as methylphenidate and amphetamines, are considered the first-line treatment for ADHD. Pharmacologic treatment is considered the first line of treatment for ADHD. CNS stimulants are the first choice of agents in that they have the highest efficacy with generally mild tolerable side effects. Parent training programs (Option B): While parent training helps manage ADHD symptoms, especially behavioural aspects, it is usually part of a broader treatment plan, not the first-line treatment. Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) (Option D): CBT is beneficial for older children and adolescents, helping them develop coping strategies. Psychosocial interventions usually are activities involving paying attention, waiting for their turn, and following instructions. However, it is not the primary treatment in younger children with ADHD.",

      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Correct answer: B) Familial genetic links, with a heritability of about 75% Explanation: Genetic factors play a major role in ADHD, with a heritability of about 75%. Genes like DAT1 and DRD4 are linked to the condition. Previously it was described as “minimal brain damage”. Aetiology of ADHD Genetic Factors (Option B) Neurochemical Factors Neurophysiological and Neuroanatomical Factors Developmental Factors Psychosocial Factors ADHD has a strong genetic link, with a heritability of about 75%. Children with ADHD are more likely to have parents or siblings with the condition, indicating a familial pattern. DAT1 gene and DRD4 gene, are known to be associated with ADHD. ADHD is linked to dopamine dysfunction. The noradrenergic system, which influences attention and alertness, is also believed to play a role. ADHD medications typically increase levels of dopamine and norepinephrine. EEG usually shows theta and beta waves in the frontal brain- indicating inattention and mood swings respectively. Decreased activity in brain areas like the prefrontal cortex, anterior cingulate, and basal ganglia. (Option C) Certain prenatal and perinatal factors, such as premature birth, maternal infections during pregnancy, and low birth weight, may increase the risk of ADHD. Severe abuse, neglect, or maltreatment can worsen or mimic ADHD symptoms. Dysfunction of the serotonin system (Option A): The dopamine system is indicated in ADHD, not the serotonin. ADHD medications work to increase the levels of Dopamine in the patient Increased activity of norepinephrine (Option D): Norepinephrine activity is usually decreased in patients with ADHD.

      },
      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Correct answer: C) Symptoms impair functioning in multiple settings Explanation: For an ADHD diagnosis to be confirmed , symptoms must be present in at least two different environments , such as both school and home. This ensures that the behaviour is not limited to one specific context and indicates a broader issue with attention and self-regulation. Symptom duration of at least three months (Option A): The diagnosis of ADHD requires that symptoms of inattention, hyperactivity, or impulsivity persist for at least six months, according to standard diagnostic guidelines. Symptoms persist after the age of 18 (Option B): While ADHD can continue into adulthood, the diagnosis is based on symptoms that first emerge before the age of 12. Persisting into adulthood is not a requirement for diagnosis, though it can affect long-term management. Symptoms first appear after age 12 (Option D): According to diagnostic criteria, ADHD symptoms must be observed before age 12. If symptoms emerge after this age, they may be attributable to other factors or conditions. Reference: Kaplan and Sodock’s Synopsis of Psychiatry, 12th Edition, Page 422, 427",
