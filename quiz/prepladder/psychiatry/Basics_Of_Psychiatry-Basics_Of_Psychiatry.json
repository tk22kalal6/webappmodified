      "question": "A 30-year-old male presented with complaints of decreased energy, feeling low and sad for most of the time since the last 3 months. The patient says that he occasionally feels anxious during certain situations. Which of the following terms best describes the patient’s presentation?",
      "options": {
        "A": "Mood",
        "B": "Affect",
        "C": "Abstract reasoning",
        "D": "Perceptual disturbances"
      },
      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "Correct answer: A) Mood Explanation: Feeling ‘low’, ‘sad’, ‘anxious’ (internal subjective experiences) by the patient is best described by the term “Mood” . Mood & Affect: Mood (Option A) Affect (Option B) Subjective experience of patient’s pervasive and persistent emotional state. Expression of mood (emotions) in terms of facial expressions and body language. Internal phenomenon External phenomenon Told by the patient Experienced by the therapist Long-term: persistent and sustained Cross-sectional: observed at that moment Example : A patient reports feeling sad and hopeless for weeks, indicating a depressed mood. Example : The patient appears tearful, withdrawn, and downcast during a therapy session, even though they verbally describe feeling “okay.” Abstract reasoning (Option C) is the ability of a person to think conceptually and comprehend rather than relying on concrete examples. There is no such presentation in the given scenario. Perceptual disturbances (Option D) are the disturbances in perception, such as illusions, hallucinations , etc. Feeling low/anxious (in the given scenario) does not fall into this term.

      "explanation": "Correct Answer: A) 24-Hour Recall Method Explanations: 24-Hour Recall Method: This method involves asking patients to recall events, activities, or conversations that occurred within the last 24 hours, effectively assessing recent memory function. Types of memory Immediate memory/ Short-term memory Recent Memory Remote Memory The ability to hold and manipulate information temporarily while performing cognitive tasks. The ability to recall information or events that have occurred recently, typically within the last few days or weeks. The ability to recall information or events from the distant past, often years or decades ago. Seconds Minutes, hours to days Months, Years to a lifetime Eg- Solving a math problem in your head, remembering a phone number long enough to dial it. Eg- Recalling a conversation from earlier today or remembering what you ate for breakfast. Eg-Remembering childhood experiences or significant historical events. Test for concentration and attention to assess immediate memory. Digit Span Test, n-back task, and mental arithmetic tasks. 24-Hour Recall Method, Rey Auditory Verbal Learning Test (RAVLT). Autobiographical memory questioning,asking personal information. Serial 7s Subtraction Method (Option B): This method assesses concentration and attention by having patients repeatedly subtract 7 from 100 but does not evaluate recent memory or recall of past events. Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) (Option C): General cognitive assessment tool that screens for various cognitive impairments but does not focus specifically on recent memory. Digit Span Test (Option D): This test assesses short-term and working memory by requiring individuals to repeat back sequences of numbers but does not evaluate recent memory related to past events.

      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: C) Serial 7s Subtraction Test Explanation: Serial 7s Subtraction Test: This test assesses concentration by requiring participants to continuously subtract 7 from 100, focusing on sustained attention and mental arithmetic. Concentration Orientation Attention Cognitive ability to focus one's mental efforts on a specific task, stimulus, or activity for an extended period while ignoring irrelevant information or distractions. Awareness of oneself in relation to time, place, and person. Cognitive process of selectively concentrating on specific aspects of the environment while ignoring others. It involves: Sustained mental focus Efficient information processing Resisting cognitive fatigue Components : Temporal Orientation: Understanding the time. Spatial Orientation: Awareness of one’s position in relation to the environment. Personal Orientation: Recognition of one’s identity. It involves Focusing on relevant stimuli Sustaining concentration over time Dividing focus between multiple tasks Shifting focus when needed Assessment method: Serial 7s Subtraction Method: Procedure : The subject starts with a number (typically 100). They subtract 7 repeatedly, stating each result aloud. This continues for a set number of subtractions or a specific time period. Example sequence: 100, 93, 86, 79, 72, 65. Assessment : Often evaluated through direct questioning and observation. Questioning like: What is your name? Who am I? What place is this? Where is it located? Assessment Methods: Continuous Performance Test (CPT) Trail Making Test Stroop Color and Word Test Digit Span Test- Digit forward (option B) and Digit backward test. Digit Span Test (Option A): This test evaluates short-term memory by requiring individuals to repeat back sequences of numbers, but it does not specifically focus on concentration. 24-Hour Recall Method (Option D): This method assesses memory by asking individuals to recall everything they ate and did over the past 24 hours.

      "explanation": "Correct answer: D) 1,2,3,4,5,6 Explanation: Mental status examination (MSE) is the psychiatric equivalent of general physical examination in the rest of medicine. All the above-mentioned parameters are components of MSE. Mental Status Examination (MSE): The Mental Status Examination (MSE) is the psychiatric counterpart to a physical examination used in the rest of medicine. It examines all aspects of mental functioning and identifies signs and symptoms indicative of mental illness. It provides a “snapshot” of the patient’s mental state at the time of the assessment. Cognitive evaluation in MSE is usually done in the form of a Mini Mental Status Examination (MMSE). Aspects of MSE: General description: Appearance and behavior Motor activity (Statement-6) Speech (Statement-1) Emotional state: Mood: subjective experience of patient’s internal and sustained emotional state Affect: expression of mood (that appears to the clinician) (Statement-2) Thinking: Thought content (Statement-3) Thought process Perceptual disturbances Cognition (higher mental function): most commonly evaluated by Mini Mental Status Examination (MMSE) Orientation Registration Attention & calculation Memory (immediate, recent & long term) Abstract reasoning (Statement-5) Insight & Judgement (Statement-4) Reference: Kaplan & Saddock’s synopsis of Psychiatry, 12th Edition, Page 48-56",

      "explanation": "Correct Answer: A) Raven's Progressive Matrices Explanation: Raven's Progressive Matrices : This test evaluates abstract reasoning and the ability to identify patterns and relationships among visual stimuli, making it a standard assessment for abstract thinking. Abstract Thinking Intelligence The ability to understand concepts that are not tied to concrete objects or experiences; involves reasoning about ideas, principles, and relationships. Broader construct that encompasses various cognitive abilities, including reasoning, problem-solving, learning, and adaptation to new situations. Components: Pattern recognition Problem-solving skills Conceptualization Logical reasoning Components: Logical reasoning Verbal comprehension Quantitative reasoning Spatial visualization Assessment Methods: Raven's Progressive Matrices Proverb testing Similarity testing Assessment Methods: Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale (WAIS) Stanford-Binet Intelligence Scales Example : When asked the meaning of the proverb, \"A stitch in time saves nine,\" a person explains that it means solving a small problem early can prevent it from becoming a bigger issue. This shows an ability to grasp the underlying concept rather than just the literal meaning. Example : Navigating daily life challenges by adapting, learning, and making decisions also reflects intelligence. Digit Span Test (Option B): This test primarily focuses on assessing short-term and working memory rather than abstract thinking abilities. Serial 7s Subtraction Test (Option C): This method assesses concentration and attention by having participants subtract 7 from 100, not abstract reasoning. 24-Hour Recall Method (Option D): This method evaluates recent memory by asking patients to recall events or activities from the past 24 hours, not abstract thinking.

Disorders of the flow of thought - thought tempo/speed increased: 1) Flight of ideas: (Option D) Disorder of flow of thought with increased tempo/speed Succession of multiple associations of thoughts following each other rapidly. Goal is not usually reached . However, both the words and sentences make sense . Speech is rapid, pressurized but still partially understandable . Seen in mania, schizophrenia, and organic mental disorders . Clang association (Option A): form of Flight of Ideas but the words in the sentences are rather connected by rhyming . Eg. ‘How high? I fly, look at the sky, feeling shy’. 2) Prolixity: Milder form of Flight of Ideas, where the speech is less rapid and better understandable. Also known as ordered flight of ideas. Goal is reached. Seen in hypomania. Circumstantiality (Option B) : Disorder of flow of thought with tempo decreased . Here the speech and thoughts are slow (not rapid) but the continuity is preserved, characterized by the overinclusion of unnecessary and trivial details but ultimately reaches the answer . Loosening of association (Option C) : Disorder of form of thought . Similar to the Flight of Ideas, words form meaning but the sentences do not form meaning and successive associations are not connected . Speech is discoherent and completely non-understandable.

(Statement-2) Tangentiality: Flow of irrelevant thoughts that deviates from the main topic and never reaches the answer. Continuity disrupted: Perseveration: (Statement-4) Same thought persists beyond the point of relevance. Pathological repetition of the same response to different stimuli. Seen in organic mental disorder (Statement-3) and schizophrenia. Thought blocking: Sudden arrest of thought and then the person resumes with an entirely new thought. Seen in schizophrenia.

      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: B) Tangentiality Explanation: In tangentiality, the patient responds in a way that is related to the general topic but does not answer the question directly, which fits the scenario. Tangentiality is characterized by oblique, digressive, or irrelevant speech that fails to convey the central idea. Example: Doctor: \"Have you had any trouble sleeping?\" Patient: \"I usually sleep in my bed, but now I’m sleeping on the sofa.\" Circumstantiality (Option A): The patient eventually answers the question after giving excessive detail, which is not the case here. Example: When asked about their health, a patient begins by explaining their entire morning routine, describing what they had for breakfast and the weather, before finally answering the question about their health. Neologism (Option C): New words or ordinary words used in a new way, are often linked to schizophrenia. Example: A patient says, \"I need to go to the flibberflam store to get some boozleberries.\" These words are not real and have meaning only to the speaker. Loosening of association (Option D): A thought or speech disturbance where ideas shift randomly, resulting in disorganized, unconnected thoughts that fail to convey a coherent message. Often associated with schizophrenia. Example: \"I like working as an accountant. The clouds today are so nice. Did you see that movie about space?\" Reference: Kaplan & Saddock’s synopsis of Psychiatry 12th Edition, Page 53, 3562, 3576, 3578, 3585",
