      "question": "Among the following, what is the most common symptom of adult obsessive-compulsive disorder?",
      "options": {
        "A": "Aggressive symptoms",
        "B": "Need for symmetry",
        "C": "Pathological doubt",
        "D": "Sexual symptom"
      },
      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: C) Pathological doubt Explanation: The most common symptom of adult obsessive-compulsive disorder is pathological doubt. Individuals with OCD experience persistent, irrational doubts, leading to repetitive checking behaviours or seeking reassurance to alleviate anxiety. This symptom is a core feature of OCD and contributes to ritualistic behaviours. Clinical presentation of OCD Contamination is the most common presentation. An obsession with contamination followed by washing and avoiding the presumably contaminated object. Pathological doubt is the second most common presentation Obsession of doubt, usually followed by compulsion of checking. Intrusive/forbidden thoughts are the third most common presentation. Obsessed with intrusive thoughts of aggressive or sexual acts without a compulsion. Symmetry/ordering is the fourth most common presentation. The patient needs symmetry/precision, which results in the compulsion of slowness. Aggressive symptoms (Option A) can occur in some cases of obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), but they are not the most common. Intrusive thoughts or images of harm or violence, along with compulsions to reduce these thoughts, may be present in certain individuals, but they are less prevalent than other symptoms. Need for symmetry (Option B), is a common symptom of OCD, where individuals feel compelled to arrange objects symmetrically, follow strict routines, or repeatedly check for order. However, it is not the most prevalent symptom in adult OCD. Sexual symptoms (Option D) are not the most common in OCD. Sexual obsessions may cause distress, prompting individuals to engage in repetitive behaviours or mental rituals to suppress or neutralise these thoughts.

      "question": "What is the most appropriate treatment for a patient who frequently experiences a sense of contamination in their hands and compulsively washes them, leading to distress and impaired performance?",
      "options": {
        "A": "DBT",
        "B": "Exposure and response prevention",
        "C": "Systematic desensitization",
        "D": "CBT"
      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: B) Exposure and response prevention Explanation: The patient's symptoms suggest Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder (OCD), c haracterized by intrusive thoughts (obsessions) like contamination and repetitive behaviours (compulsions) like excessive handwashing. The most effective treatment for OCD is Exposure and Response Prevention (ERP) , a specialized form of Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT). ERP works by exposing the patient to anxiety-provoking situations (e.g., touching a surface perceived as contaminated) and preventing the compulsive response (e.g., washing hands), helping the patient habituate to the anxiety and reducing the compulsions over time. Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) Obsessions Compulsions Intrusive and unwanted repetitive thoughts, urges, or impulses. Most common: Contamination Repetitive actions or thoughts carried out in a strict, regulation-bound manner or reaction to obsessions Performed to relieve anxiety or fear. Most common: Checking Clinical Presentation of OCD: Contamination and Cleansing (Most Common): Obsession with contamination followed by compulsive washing and avoidance of presumed contaminants. Pathological Doubt and Checking (Second Most Common): Persistent doubt leading to repeated checking. Intrusive or Forbidden Thoughts (Third Most Common): IIIIIII Obsessive thoughts of aggressive or sexual acts, typically without accompanying compulsions. Symmetry and Ordering (Fourth Most Common): IIIIIII Preoccupation with symmetry or precision, resulting in compulsions like slow and deliberate actions. Other Symptoms: IIIIIII Includes religious obsessions and compulsive hoarding. Management of OCD: Pharmacotherapy: First-line Treatment: SSRIs and Clomipramine, continued for 1–2 years. Augmentation Options: Antipsychotics: Risperidone, Aripiprazole. Others: Memantine, Riluzole, Ketamine, Lamotrigine, N-acetylcysteine (NAC). Psychotherapy: Exposure and Response Prevention (ERP): Patients face feared situations while refraining from compulsive responses. Additional Therapies: Desensitization, thought-stopping, flooding, aversive conditioning, psychodynamic psychotherapy, and family therapy. Severe Symptoms or Comorbid Depression: Begin with pharmacotherapy. Somatic Therapies: Anterior cingulotomy or capsulotomy. Deep brain stimulation with electrode implantation. Incorrect Options: DBT (Option A) Dialectical behavioural therapy is not considered the first management line in OCD. It is commonly used for individuals diagnosed with borderline personality disorder or mood disorders. Systematic desensitization (Option C) , thought-stopping, flooding, and aversive conditioning are also used to treat OCD. However, exposure and response prevention is the best way of managing this condition. CBT (Option D) Exposure and response prevention is a kind of CBT that helps reduce anxiety and distress associated with repeated exposure to thoughts or objects triggering the condition.

      "question": "In the psychiatry OPD, a male patient aged 40 presents with a concern regarding persistent thoughts. Specifically, he experiences a constant belief that his hands are dirty despite them being clean. Consequently, he feels uneasy and is compelled to repeatedly wash his hands. The condition can be classified as a disorder involving thought processes known as ______.",
      "options": {
        "A": "Flow",
        "B": "Form",
        "C": "Possession",
        "D": "Content"
      },
      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer C - Possession The patient’s persistent, distressing belief that his hands are dirty, despite them being clean, is suggestive of obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD). In OCD, thought possession means that the individual is aware that their obsessive thoughts are irrational or excessive, but they cannot stop them. The patient experiences the thoughts as intrusive and unwanted, yet they still recognise them as coming from within their own mind. Flow (Option A) refers to the overall continuity or rhythm of thought, which can be disrupted in various ways. In a disorder of flow, there may be issues such as racing thoughts or thought blocks. In the patient's case, there's no mention of the speed or rhythm of thoughts being disturbed. Form (Option B) of thought refers to the structure or organisation of thoughts. It involves whether the thoughts are logically connected or disjointed. Here, the problem isn't with the logical structure of his thoughts but with the content of his thoughts Content (Option D) refers to the actual subject of the thought, but it doesn't address the distress and lack of control experienced by the patient.

      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: B) Schizoid personality disorder Explanation: The patient's symptoms of social isolation, emotional coldness, and preference for living alone align with the features of schizoid personality disorder.
