      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "metabolic side effects . Many patients discontinue the medication due to excessive weight gain, increased appetite, and risk of metabolic syndrome (including diabetes and dyslipidemia) . This is one of the most frequent reasons for non-compliance with olanzapine treatment. Antipsychotic Medications: First Generation Antipsychotics (Typical) Second Generation Antipsychotics (Atypical) Second Generation Antipsychotics (Atypical) D2 receptor antagonist Partial D2 Agonists D2/5-HT2A Antagonists Haloperidol Fluphenazine Perphenazine Chlorpromazine Aripiprazole Brexpiprazole Cariprazine Risperidone Olanzapine Quetiapine Ziprasidone Paliperidone Lurasidone Clozapine Treatment Duration: For first-episode patients, a minimum of 1-2 years of treatment is recommended. For those with multiple episodes , indefinite treatment is often advised. Side Effects: Extrapyramidal Side Effects (EPS) Common with first-generation antipsychotics , including symptoms like Acute dystonia - Earliest, can occur within minutes of the injection (Option B) Parkinson's - Occurs within days to weeks Akathisia - Occurs within days to weeks (Option C) Alternatives for management include dose reduction, antiparkinson medications, or switching to medications with lower EPS risk. Tardive Dyskinesia (TD) (Option D) Affects 20-30% of patients on long-term first-generation antipsychotics , with higher risk in the elderly and those with cognitive or mood disorders. Prevention strategies include using the lowest effective doses and switching to other medications like Clozapine. Sedation & Postural hypotension Especially with low-potency antipsychotics. Long-term antipsychotic use can elevate prolactin levels, affecting sexual function and potentially leading to osteoporosis.

      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "include decision-making, motivation, impulse control, emotional regulation, and social behavior. Dysfunction or lesions in the frontal lobe can lead to changes in behavior, impulsivity, disinhibition, impaired judgment, and difficulties in motivation. The symptoms described in the scenario, such as urinating in public without remorse and difficulty in getting motivated, are more consistent with frontal lobe dysfunction. Incorrect Options: Option A. Parietal lobe: The parietal lobe is primarily involved in processing sensory information and spatial awareness. It plays a role in integrating sensory input, perception of touch, spatial orientation, and body awareness. However, the symptoms described in the scenario, such as urinating in public without remorse, difficulty in motivation, and mild memory deficits, are not typically associated with lesions or dysfunction in the parietal lobe. Option B. Occipital lobe: The occipital lobe is primarily responsible for processing visual information. It is involved in visual perception, object recognition, and visual memory. However, the symptoms mentioned in the scenario do not directly align with occipital lobe dysfunction, as they are not primarily related to visual processing or visual disturbances. Option D. Temporal lobe: The temporal lobe is involved in various functions, including memory, language processing, auditory perception, and emotional regulation. While mild memory deficits can be associated with temporal lobe dysfunction, the other symptoms described in the scenario, such as urinating in public without remorse and difficulty in motivation, are not commonly associated with isolated temporal lobe dysfunction",

      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "confusional state characterized by a disturbance in attention and awareness. Delirium often has a rapid onset and fluctuating course, and it is commonly caused by underlying medical conditions, such as infections, metabolic imbalances, drug intoxication, or withdrawal. Delirium is a medical emergency that requires prompt evaluation and treatment to address the underlying cause and manage the symptoms. Incorrect option: Option B. Dementia: Dementia is a chronic and progressive neurocognitive disorder characterized by a decline in memory, thinking, behavior, and the ability to perform daily activities. Unlike delirium, dementia develops slowly and gradually over time, and it is not considered an acute disorder. While dementia can cause cognitive impairment, it is not the most common acute organic mental disorder. Option C. Amnesia: Amnesia refers to the loss of memory, either partial or complete, due to various causes such as brain injury, trauma, or psychological factors. While amnesia can occur acutely, it is not as common as delirium as an acute organic mental disorder. Delirium involves not only memory impairment but also disturbances in attention, awareness, and other cognitive functions. Option D. Anxiety disorder: Anxiety disorder is a broad term that encompasses various mental health conditions characterized by excessive worry, fear, and anxiety. While anxiety disorders can occur acutely, they are not classified as acute organic mental disorders. Acute organic mental disorders typically refer to conditions with an acute onset and organic (physiological) etiology, such as delirium caused by medical factors.",

Delusions are fixed, false beliefs that are maintained despite evidence to the contrary. While various factors can contribute to the development of delusional disorder, young age is not considered a significant risk factor. Incorrect options: Option A. Recent immigration: Recent immigration can be a risk factor for delusional disorder. The stressors and challenges associated with adapting to a new environment, cultural differences, and social isolation can potentially contribute to the development of delusions. Option B. Social isolation: Social isolation or lack of social support is considered a risk factor for delusional disorder. It can lead to feelings of loneliness, exacerbate existing delusions, and contribute to the persistence of abnormal beliefs. Option C. Family history: Family history of psychiatric disorders, including delusional disorder, is considered a risk factor.

In the context of schizophrenia, the primary symptoms include positive symptoms (e.g., hallucinations, delusions), negative symptoms (e.g., reduced emotional expression, social withdrawal), and cognitive impairments (e.g., disorganized thinking, difficulty concentrating). Automatism is not considered a core feature or defining symptom of schizophrenia. Incorrect options Option A. Autism: Autism is a developmental disorder characterized by difficulties in social interaction, communication challenges, and repetitive behaviors. Autism and schizophrenia are separate diagnostic entities with distinct symptomatology. While some symptoms may overlap between autism and schizophrenia, they are considered distinct disorders with different underlying causes and diagnostic criteria. Option C. Association defect: Association defect, also known as formal thought disorder or disorganized thinking, is a fundamental symptom of schizophrenia. It refers to disruptions in the logical and coherent flow of thoughts, resulting in difficulties in organizing and expressing ideas coherently. Association defects can manifest as tangential thinking, loose associations, or incoherent speech patterns. Option D. Ambivalence: Ambivalence, or the coexistence of conflicting feelings or attitudes, can be present in schizophrenia but is not considered a fundamental symptom. Ambivalence can manifest as mixed emotions, contradictory thoughts, or indecisiveness. It is more commonly associated with other psychiatric conditions, such as borderline personality disorder, rather than being specific to schizophrenia.",

It is a symptom commonly associated with various mental health conditions, particularly depressive disorders such as major depressive disorder (MDD). Other symptoms of depression may also be present alongside anhedonia, such as changes in appetite, sleep disturbances, low mood, fatigue, and difficulty concentrating. There are two types of anhedonia: Social anhedonia: This refers to a reduced ability to experience pleasure from social interactions or relationships. People with social anhedonia may find it difficult to engage in and enjoy social activities, leading to feelings of isolation and disconnection. Physical or sensory anhedonia: This refers to a diminished pleasure response to sensory stimuli, such as taste, touch, or other physical sensations. Individuals may have difficulty deriving pleasure from activities such as eating delicious food, engaging in sexual experiences, or experiencing the enjoyment of touch or warmth. Treatment for anhedonia often involves a combination of psychotherapy and medication. Psychotherapeutic approaches such as cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) and behavioral activation can help individuals identify and modify negative thought patterns and engage in pleasurable activities. Antidepressant medications, such as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) or other classes of antidepressants, may also be prescribed to address anhedonia as part of overall symptom management. Incorrect Options: Option A. Tangentiality is a formal thought disorder where the person responds to questions with irrelevant details that never reach a goal. Option C. Alexithymia is difficulty in identifying and expressing emotions. Option D. Asociality includes a lack of interest or motivation to engage in social interactions. Reference: .",

        "D": "Haloperidol"
      },
      "correct_answer": "D",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer D - Haloperidol Explanation: The patient is presenting with symptoms of an acute manic episode, which is a feature of bipolar disorder. Symptoms such as excessive elation, reduced sleep, irritability, increased talkativeness, and disruptive behaviour are characteristic of mania. In this scenario, haloperidol, a typical antipsychotic, is the most appropriate treatment that works by blocking dopamine D2 receptors, which helps to control the agitation, aggression, and psychotic features associated with mania. t provides rapid symptom relief and is effective in managing acute manic episodes. Incorrect Options: Lithium (Option A) is a mood stabiliser primarily used for long-term management of bipolar disorder. While it is effective in preventing manic and depressive episodes, it is not suitable for acute management due to its delayed onset of action. It also requires regular serum level monitoring to avoid toxicity, making it less ideal for immediate symptom relief in this case. Lorazepam (Option B) is a benzodiazepine used to manage anxiety and agitation but does not directly treat the underlying symptoms of mania. While it may help calm the patient temporarily, it is not effective for controlling the psychotic or manic symptoms, such as excessive energy and impulsivity, that are present in this case. Carbamazepine (Option C) is a mood stabiliser and anticonvulsant used to treat acute manic and mixed episodes of bipolar disorder. However, its onset of action is slower compared to antipsychotics like haloperidol. It is more commonly used for long-term management and prevention rather than for rapid symptom control in acute mania, making it a less suitable option in this case.

      "explanation": "Correct Answer C - Insidious onset of symptoms In schizophrenia, an insidious onset is typically associated with a worse prognosis . It often reflects a more chronic course of the illness, with poorer long-term outcomes, as the symptoms develop slowly over time and can be harder to treat effectively. Prognostic factors of Schizophrenia Positive factors Negative factors Acute onset Female sex Living in a developed country Presence of mood symptoms (Option D ruled out) Family history of mood disorder Married Insidious onset Childhood or adolescent onset Poor premorbid functioning Cognitive impairment Absence of mood symptoms Negative symptoms Family History of schizophrenia Single/ separated/ divorced Positive symptoms (Option A) of schizophrenia include h allucinations, delusions, and disorganised thinking. These symptoms usually tend to respond better to treatment, especially with antipsychotic medications. Positive symptoms are typically associated with a better prognosis compared to negative symptoms, which usually contribute to a bad prognosis. Late age of onset (Option B) of schizophrenia occurs after age 45 years of age, and it usually correlates with a better prognosis , as it often involves less severe cognitive decline and better treatment responses.

Upward rolling of the eyes (oculogyric crisis) is a presentation of acute dystonia, and Benztropine is the first-line treatment for acute dystonia caused by antipsychotic drugs, it is an anticholinergic medication. Benztropine restores the balance between dopamine and acetylcholine in the brain, making it the preferred treatment for oculogyric crisis induced by risperidone. Its potent antimuscarinic action, ability to counteract dopamine hyperactivity, rapid onset, and fewer sedative side effects make it more effective than alternatives like promethazine. Lorazepam (Option A) is a benzodiazepine that has some muscle-relaxant properties and is used in some cases of dystonia, and IV diazepam (another benzodiazepine) can help treat oculogyric crises . However, neither lorazepam nor diazepam are considered first-line management for acute dystonia. Olanzapine (Option C) is another atypical antipsychotic used to treat schizophrenia and other disorders, and while it can be used in the management of oculogyric crises, it is not a first-line treatment. Stop antipsychotic (Option D) : This may be considered in recurrent cases of acute dystonia or if the treatment is unsuccessful (i.e., after failure of medical management with anticholinergics or antihistamines ). However, immediately stopping the antipsychotic is not the first step in acute management. Reference: Kaplan & Sadock’s Synopsis of Psychiatry, 12th Edition, Pages 1889, 1891, 1892.",

        "B": "Delusional disorder",
        "C": "Schizophrenia",
        "D": "Brief psychotic disorder"
      },
      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer C - Schizophrenia The patient's presentation of auditory hallucinations (hearing voices from aliens instructing harm) persisting for seven months strongly suggests schizophrenia. Key diagnostic features include: Hallucinations: Perception of voices in the absence of external stimuli, a hallmark of schizophrenia. Duration: Symptoms persisting for more than six months are required for a diagnosis of schizophrenia, as per DSM-5 criteria. Content of hallucinations: The bizarre and threatening nature of the auditory hallucinations aligns with the psychotic features commonly seen in schizophrenia. Types of Schizophrenia: Type of Schizophrenia Characteristics Paranoid Schizophrenia Characterised by delusions and hallucinations. Individuals may have a fixed belief that others are out to harm them, often leading to mistrust and vigilance. Cognitive functions usually remain intac t, while emotional responses may be inappropriate. Catatonic Schizophrenia Characterised by three or more of the following symptoms: Motor immobility ( stupor) Excessive, odd movement (stereotypies or mannerisms) Waxy flexibility (bending like a wax candle) Extreme negativism (resisting instructions or maintaining rigidity) Unusual postures (bizarre posturing, catalepsy) Echolalia or echopraxia (Mimicking speech or movements) Disorganised (Hebephrenic) Schizophrenia Involves disorganised speech and behavior. Inappropriate emotional responses and poor functioning. Typically associated with a poorer prognosis. Residual Schizophrenia History of schizophrenia with delusions and hallucinations (in the past 1 year) with lingering negative symptoms but minimal or no positive symptoms at present. No prominent delusions or hallucinations Individuals may exhibit social withdrawal and reduced emotional expression. Simple Schizophrenia Involves prominent negative symptoms Undifferentiated Schizophrenia Diagnosis for patients who do not fit into other categories presenting a mix of symptoms. Mania (Option A) involves elevated mood, grandiosity, and hyperactivity but does not typically present with persistent hallucinations instructing harm. Delusional Disorder (Option B) involves non-bizarre delusions without prominent hallucinations. Persistent auditory hallucinations exclude this diagnosis. Brief Psychotic Disorder (Option D) involves psychotic symptoms lasting less than one month, ruling it out in this case where symptoms have persisted for seven months.

While medical causes (e.g., delirium and neurological disorders) can occasionally produce hallucinations, visual or tactile hallucinations are more indicative of a medical etiology than auditory hallucinations. Elderly age (Option A) : Mental illnesses in older adults are more likely to have a medical or organic cause (e.g., dementia, delirium, or metabolic abnormalities). Loss of consciousness (Option B) suggests possible neurological issues such as epilepsy, head trauma, or other medical conditions causing altered mental states. Acute onset (Option D) : Rapid onset of psychiatric symptoms strongly suggests a medical cause , such as delirium, stroke, or infection.

      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Pseudohallucinations are not perceived in the objective space. They are typically perceived in the subjective or internal space of the individual's mind. These perceptions might seem real to the person experiencing them, but they are not projected into the external environment. Incorrect Options: Option A- They occur without external stimulus: Pseudohallucinations are defined as perceptions that occur without an external stimulus. In other words, the individual experiences sensory perceptions that seem real but are not triggered by any actual external input. This can be contrasted with true hallucinations, which are perceptions without external stimuli but are experienced as if they are real. Option C- They are not vivid: hallucinations are often described as vivid and intense sensory experiences. While they are not based on external stimuli, they can still be very detailed and realistic to the person experiencing them. This vividness contributes to the confusion between pseudohallucinations and true hallucinations. Option D- They are done voluntarily: Pseudohallucinations, like true hallucinations, are under the control of the individual experiencing them. They occur voluntarily and are often distressing to the person. The lack of control distinguishes hallucinations from imagination or deliberate thought processes. Reference: .",

      "explanation": "Correct Answer: A) Benzhexol Explanation: Anticholinergic medications like benzhexol (which acts on the parasympathetic nervous system by inhibiting efferent pulses directly) can be used to treat Acute Dystonia . It refers to brief, sudden muscle contractions that lead to abnormal movements or postures. This extrapyramidal side effect, commonly seen with antipsychotic medications, occurs when there is a disruption in the nigrostriatal pathway, which plays a key role in motor control. Clinical manifestations: Oculogyric crises (upward rolling of eyes) Tongue protrusion Trismus (jaw muscles) Torticollis (neck muscles twisting to one side) Laryngospasm Dysarthria, Dysphasia (glossopharyngeal symptoms) Dystonic postures of the limbs and trunk. Management: Anticholinergic drugs: Parenteral (IV or IM) is for immediate treatment Oral is used for prophylaxis Drugs include Benztropine, Diphenhydramine, and Promethazine. Replace with fluphenazine (Option B): Fluphenazine is a first-generation antipsychotic primarily used to treat symptoms of schizophrenia and other psychotic disorders. Increase the dose of haloperidol (Option C): Haloperidol is a first-generation antipsychotic (typical antipsychotic) effective for managing psychosis but is known for a higher risk of extrapyramidal symptoms (EPS) such as dystonia, akathisia, and tardive dyskinesia. Clozapine (Option D) is a second-generation antipsychotic specifically indicated for treatment-resistant schizophrenia and is known for its efficacy in patients who do not respond to other antipsychotic medications.

It is one of the hallmark symptoms of Schizophrenia. Schizophrenia’s First Rank Symptoms: Category Symptom Description Thought Alienation Phenomenon Thought Insertion A belief that others are placing thoughts into the patient’s mind. Thought Withdrawal A belief that thoughts are being removed from the patient’s mind. Thought Broadcasting A belief that others can know or access the patient’s thoughts. Made Phenomenon Made Volition A belief that actions are controlled by an external force. Made Affect A belief that external forces are altering the patient's emotions. Made Impulses Sudden urges or impulses that are perceived as implanted by others. Auditory Hallucinations Voices Arguing/Discussing The patient hears voices discussing or arguing about them, often in the third person. Example: The patient hears two voices arguing, one saying, “He’s a failure,” and the other replying, “No, he’s not.” Voices Commenting The patient hears a voice providing commentary on their actions, usually in the third person. Example: While cooking, a patient hears a voice say, “She’s burning the food,” reflecting their actions. Audible Thoughts The patient hears their own thoughts spoken aloud by a voice. Example: A patient thinks, “I need to go to the store,” and immediately hears a voice say the same phrase. Somatic Passivity Physical sensations are perceived as imposed by external agents. Example: A patient feels a burning sensation in their arm and believes it is caused by invisible rays from a satellite. Delusional Perception A normal perception is interpreted with a delusional belief Example : A patient sees a red car parked outside and believes it indicates the police are monitoring them for criminal activity. Delusion of nihilism (Option A) refers to the delusion where an individual denies the existence of their body, mind, loved ones, or the world, claiming they have no intelligence, that parts of their body are absent, or even believing they are dead or that the world has ended. It is seen in disorders such as schizophrenia and depression. Delusion of reference (Option B) is a condition in which the patient believes that someone is talking about him or spying on him. Othello syndrome (Option C) or Delusion of infidelity/ jealousy refers to a condition in which the patient believes that the partner or spouse is having an affair even though that is not true. Prolonged alcohol use is linked to this condition. Reference: First rank symptoms for schizophrenia - PMC",

      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer C - Obsessive-compulsive disorder. Explanation: The patient presents with repetitive behaviour of thoughts of washing her hands and doubts of them being contaminated, which are features of Obsessive Compulsive Disorder. Obsessions Compulsions Intrusive and unwanted repetitive thoughts, urges, or impulses. Most common: Contamination Repetitive actions or thoughts carried out in a strict, regulation-bound manner or reaction to obsessions. Performed to relieve anxiety or fear. Most common: Checking Major symptom patterns: Symptom Pattern Description Contamination/Cleansing Obsession with contamination, followed by washing/avoidance. Pathological Doubt/Checking Obsession with doubt, followed by compulsive checking. Intrusive/Forbidden Thoughts Intrusive thoughts of aggression or sexual acts, without compulsion. Symmetry/Ordering Need for symmetry or precision, leading to compulsive slowness. Other Symptoms Religious obsessions and compulsive hoarding. Treatment Description Pharmacotherapy First line : SSRIs (preferred), Clomipramine. Treatment for 1-2 years. Augmenting agents : Antipsychotics (Risperidone, Aripiprazole), Memantine, Riluzole, Ketamine, Lamotrigine, N-acetylcysteine (NAC). Psychotherapy Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) : Exposure and response prevention (ERP). Other therapies: Desensitization, Thought-stopping, Flooding, Aversive conditioning, Psychodynamic psychotherapy, and Family therapy. CBT is preferred in younger patients. Combination of CBT and pharmacotherapy is useful. Somatic Therapies Anterior cingulotomy, Capsulotomy, Deep brain stimulation with electrodes. Incorrect Options: Phobia (Option A) involves a morbid and irrational fear with acute anxiety and panic-like symptoms. Forced thinking (Option B) is seen in the pre-ictal stage and is relieved after a seizure. Generalized anxiety disorder (Option D) involves continuous, free-floating anxiety and is not situation-dependent.

      "correct_answer": "D",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: D) Use benzodiazepines for symptom relief Explanation: The patient's symptoms, such as palpitations, sweating, chest heaviness, and pain, suggest a panic attack , with no abnormalities in blood tests, ECG, and chest X-ray ruling out organic causes. Benzodiazepines are the drug of choice for acute relief of panic attacks, providing rapid symptom control by enhancing GABA activity in the brain. For long-term management, SSRIs and Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) are recommended. Treatment of Panic attack: Pharmacological, psychological, and combined treatments. Pharmacotherapy: Drug of choice – Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors. Other first-line: Serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor (SNRI) venlafaxine. Second-line: Tricyclic antidepressants, MAOIs Other Psychotropics - Agomelatine, Buspirone, Mirtazapine. Benzodiazepines: Short-term use as an adjunct to SSRIs. Acute phase – Benzodiazepines such as Lorazepam & Clonazepam . Psychosocial therapies: Cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) Interpersonal therapy. Incorrect Options: Admit for detailed investigations (Option A) : It is not required as the investigations in the past showed no abnormality. Start counselling sessions (Option B) : Counselling sessions are started only once the panic attack is under control. Use beta-blockers (Option C) : They are more so used in social anxiety and do not play a significant role in panic attacks.

      "explanation": "Correct Answer A - Panic disorder: The patient’s intermittent episodes of intense sweating, a sensation of imminent danger, and occurrence before exams are characteristic of panic disorder. It involves recurrent episodes of acute anxiety, often accompanied by physical symptoms and a sense of impending doom. Panic disorder General information More common in females than males. Median age of onset: late adolescence or early adulthood. Familial risk: Highest for early-onset panic disorder. Patients with panic disorder commonly have agoraphobia Panic attacks for more than a month are termed as a Panic disorder. Neurotransmitters that are implicated in the development of panic disorders are norepinephrine, Serotonin, GABA, and Cholecystokinin. Symptoms Unexpected onset, not tied to specific situations. Duration typically 20–30 minutes, rarely exceeding one hour. Cardiopulmonary symptoms: Shortness of breath, palpitations, chest discomfort. Gastrointestinal symptoms: Nausea, abdominal discomfort. Neurological symptoms: Tremors, dizziness, numbness, tingling sensations. Psychiatric symptoms: Derealization, depersonalization, fear of losing control, fear of dying. Other symptoms: Sweating, chills or hot flashes, flushed sensations Treatment Pharmacotherapy: Drug of choice : Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors. Other first-line: Serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor (SNRI) venlafaxine Second-line: Tricyclic antidepressants, MAOIs, Other Psychotropics - Agomelatine, Buspirone, Mirtazapine. Benzodiazepines: Short-term use as an adjunct to SSRIs. Acute phase – Benzodiazepines such as Lorazepam & Clonazepam. Psychosocial therapies: Cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) Interpersonal therapy. Note: Treatment of choice: SSRIs + Psychotherapy (CBT) Conversion disorder (Option B) involves neurological symptoms (such as paralysis, non-epileptic seizures, or blindness) that cannot be explained by medical or neurological conditions. This disorder is more related to motor or sensory dysfunction and is typically not episodic or associated with a fear of exams. Social anxiety disorder (Option C) involves an intense fear of being judged or embarrassed in social or performance situations. This option is less likely, as the main symptom here is intense anxiety without the fear of social evaluation typical of social anxiety disorder. Generalised anxiety disorder (Option D) is characterised by excessive, uncontrollable worry about a variety of events or activities, which lasts for at least six months. Although anxiety before exams might be present in GAD, It typically lacks the discrete episodes of intense physical symptoms (like sweating and rapid onset of fear) that characterise panic disorder.

      "explanation": "Correct Answer: C) A-3, B-4, C-2, D-1 Explanation: Depression in doctors is often difficult to diagnose because many may avoid seeking medical help due to the fear of personal and professional judgment. Rates of depression are high among doctors, and if left untreated, it significantly increases the risk of suicide. Suicide risk is higher among female physicians. Risk factors for suicide include: Personal factors: Underlying psychiatric disorders, relationship troubles, stress, and trauma. Structural factors: Increased managerialism, excessive paperwork, rushed patient interactions, limited time off, and work pressure. Endemic factors: Exposure to trauma and patient deaths. Burnout, classified as an occupational phenomenon in ICD-11, results from chronic workplace stress that is not adequately managed. It has three dimensions: Emotional exhaustion or energy depletion. Negative attitudes or cynicism related to the job or increased mental distance from work. Decreased professional efficacy. Overworking can go away as soon as the doctor leaves the hospital and takes rest.

      "explanation": "Correct Answer: D) In children, it occurs more in females than in males Explanation: The clinical scenario suggests conversion disorder and its prevalence is more common in females than males, particularly in children and adolescents. Conversion disorder is where there is a neurological symptom (like blindness ) that cannot be explained by any organic pathology and is often associated with psychological stress or conflict (in this case, the recent loss of the patient’s mother). La Belle Indifférence is a term used to describe a striking lack of concern or emotional distress about physical symptoms or disabilities, typically seen in patients with conversion disorder. Conversion Disorder (Functional neurological disorder) Predominantly, the symptoms of conversion disorder are neurological and are paradoxically experienced as involuntary or lacking in self-agencies. Seen in Females > males (Option A, B and C ruled out) Onset- Late childhood to early adulthood. Presentation of conversion disorder: Presents with symptoms suggestive of deficit in motor or sensory functions or both. But without any evidence of any physical disorder. Reason- Too much stress has converted the stress into these neurological symptoms. At times, the symptoms are inconsistent with the anatomy and physiology of the body. E.g. inconsistent tremors.

Claustrophobia (Option C) is the intense fear of enclosed or small spaces. These individuals may experience anxiety, panic, and discomfort when in places like elevators, tunnels, or crowded rooms. Nomophobia (Option D) is a fear or anxiety of being without a mobile phone or losing access to it.

      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: A) Acute stress disorder Explanation: The patient’s symptoms, including persistent fear and preoccupation with a perceived medical condition after a traumatic event, such as a robbery at gunpoint, align with Acute Stress Disorder (ASD). It typically develops shortly after exposure to a traumatic event and is characterised by intense fear, hyperarousal, and emotional distress, similar to Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD). Symptoms last from 3 days to 1 month . Treatment: Cognitive behavioural therapy and SSRIs. Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) Symptoms Mood Negative feelings like fear, guilt, anger Avoidance Avoiding people, places, or objects that relate to the traumatic event Social withdrawal Hyperarousal Hypervigilant Poor sleep Exaggerated startle response Poor concentration Intrusive symptoms Flashbacks Dreams and memories Distressing re-experiencing of the traumatic event. Diagnosis To diagnose Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) according to the DSM-5 criteria, the duration of symptoms plays a critical role. Symptoms must persist for more than 1 month after exposure to a traumatic event. Symptoms typically begin within 3 months of the trauma but can have delayed onset, appearing months or even years later. The symptoms must cause significant distress or impairment in social, occupational, or other important areas of functioning. Treatment Pharmacotherapy SSRI (most efficacious) drug SNRI (some initial evidence) Psychotherapy Trauma-focused cognitive-behavioural therapy, inclusive of prolonged exposure (PE) therapy- requires reexperiencing a traumatic event. Eye movement desensitization and reprocessing therapy (EMDR) Cognitive processing therapy (CPT) corrects overgeneralization of seeing the world as dangerous Group therapy Family therapy Schizophrenia (Option B) is one of the most common severe mental illnesses with auditory hallucinations, thought alienation phenomena, somatic passivity, and delusional perception. These symptoms are not present in the given case. Avoidant personality disorder (Option C) is characterised by being extremely sensitive to rejection, fear of criticism, disapproval, or rejection, being willing to get involved with people unless certain of being liked by them, view oneself as socially inferior. Delirium (Option D) is the most common organic mental disorder. It involves impairment of consciousness (depicted by clouding of consciousness, confused state, altered sensorium and reduced orientation) and attention (depicted by reduced ability to focus, sustaining/ shifting attention).

      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: B) Exposure and Response Prevention Explanation: The patient is exhibiting symptoms typical of Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder (OCD) , specifically contamination fears and compulsive washing. The most effective treatment for OCD, especially in cases like this, is Exposure and Response Prevention (ERP) . This technique involves exposing the patient to feared situations (e.g., touching something \"contaminated\") and preventing compulsive behaviour (e.g., hand washing). Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder: The patient has recurrent obsessions and compulsions. Recurrent obsessions or compulsions may cause severe distress or anxiety to the person. Obsessions Compulsions Intrusive and unwanted repetitive thoughts, urges, or impulses. Most common: Contamination Repetitive actions or thoughts carried out in a strict, regulation-bound manner or reaction to obsessions Performed to relieve anxiety or fear. Most common: Checking These are time-consuming (at least 1 hr/day) and significantly interfere with the person’s routine, occupational functioning, usual social activities, or relationships. Patients can have only obsessions, only compulsions, or both obsessions and compulsions (most common). The most common comorbidity associated with OCD is major depressive disorder (67%). Major symptom patterns: Contamination / Cleansing Most common presentation. An obsession with contamination followed by washing and avoidance of the presumably contaminated object. Pathological doubt /checking Second most common presentation. Obsession of doubt, usually followed by compulsion of checking. Intrusive/forbidden thoughts Third most common presentation. Obsessed with intrusive thoughts of aggressive or sexual acts without a compulsion. Symmetry/ordering Fourth most common presentation. Patient needs symmetry/precision, which results in the compulsion of slowness. Other symptoms Religious obsessions and compulsive hoarding. Symptom specifiers: Tic related: current or prior history of tic disorder. Patients may have good/fair insight. Patient with poor insight. Patient with absent insight/delusional beliefs. Treatment: Pharmacotherapy: First line: SSRIs (preferred) and Clomipramine Treatment should be continued for 1-2 years Augmenting agents: Antipsychotics: Risperidone, Aripiprazole. Others: Memantine, riluzole, ketamine, lamotrigine, and N-acetylcysteine (NAC). Psychotherapy: Cognitive Behaviour Therapy (CBT): Exposure and response prevention (ERP) Exposure to feared situations is given. The patient is asked not to engage in a compulsive response. Other therapies are desensitization, thought-stopping, flooding, aversive conditioning, psychodynamic psychotherapy, and family therapy. In younger patients , cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) is preferred first. In more severe symptoms or comorbid depression, pharmacotherapy is preferred first. A combination of CBT and pharmacotherapy is particularly useful. Somatic Therapies: Anterior cingulotomy and capsulotomy. Deep brain stimulation with implantation of electrodes.

        "C": "Pathological doubt",
        "D": "Sexual symptoms"

      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "and uncertainty, is indeed a common symptom seen in adult OCD. Individuals with OCD may experience persistent and distressing doubts, even when there is no rational basis for them. They may repeatedly seek reassurance or engage in checking behaviors to alleviate their doubts. Pathological doubt is a core feature of OCD and often contributes to the individual's ritualistic behaviors. Incorrect Options: Option A - Aggressive symptoms: Aggressive symptoms can be present in some cases of obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), but they are not the most common symptom. Aggressive obsessions, such as intrusive thoughts or images of harm or violence, coupled with compulsions aimed at reducing these thoughts, can occur in individuals with OCD. However, not all individuals with OCD experience aggressive symptoms, and they are generally not the most prevalent symptom. Option B - Need for symmetry: The need for symmetry, or a strong desire for things to be arranged or organized in a particular way, is a common symptom seen in OCD. Individuals may feel compelled to arrange objects symmetrically, follow strict routines, or repeatedly check and recheck things to ensure symmetry or order. While it is a common symptom, it is not the most prevalent symptom in adult OCD. Option D - Sexual symptoms: While sexual obsessions or intrusive thoughts related to sexual content can occur in OCD, they are generally not the most common symptom. Sexual obsessions can lead to distress and discomfort, causing individuals to engage in repetitive behaviors or mental rituals to neutralize or suppress these thoughts. However, it's important to note that the most common symptoms of adult OCD typically involve doubt, intrusive thoughts, and repetitive behaviors rather than primarily focusing on sexual content.
