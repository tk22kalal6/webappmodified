      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: C) 1-b, 2-c, 3-a Explanation: Rules related to Criminal responsibility: Durham’s rule An accused person is not criminally responsible if his unlawful act is the product of a mental disease or mental defect. Later, this rule was discarded in the USA. Curren’s rule An accused person is not criminally responsible if, at the time of committing the act, he did not have the capacity to regulate his conduct to the requirements of the law as a result of mental disease or defect. McNaughten’s rule (Section 84, IPC, Section 22, BNS ) A person is not criminally responsible if, due to a mental disease, they were unaware of the nature and consequences of their actions or unable to recognise that the act was wrong . It has the following requirements: There must be evidence of a mental disorder. The mental disorder must be present at the time of the crime. The disorder must impair the individual's ability to understand the wrongfulness or illegality of the act. Section 85 IPC (Section 23 BNS) A person who is intoxicated may not be criminally responsible if they were so impaired at the time of the act that they could not understand the nature of their actions or recognize that their actions were wrong or illegal. This applies only if the intoxication was caused against their will or without their knowledge. Section 86 IPC (Section 24 BNS) A voluntarily intoxicated person is still considered criminally responsible if they had the intention or knowledge to commit a crime, despite their intoxication.

Supported Admission: An individual who requires admission due to threats or attempts of bodily harm to themselves or others, or who is unable to care for themselves and has lost the capacity to make decisions regarding their mental healthcare or treatment. A nominated representative can provide consent for the admission. Section 89 (Option C) Admission and treatment for individuals with mental illness requiring high levels of support can be provided for up to 30 days. Section 90 (Option D) Admission and treatment for individuals with mental illness requiring high levels of support may extend beyond 30 days.

      "question": "Which of the following statements is not true regarding the decriminalisation of suicide in India as per the Mental Healthcare Act, 2017?",
      "options": {
        "A": "Suicide attempts were decriminalised as per IPC Section 309",
        "B": "The act provides treatment instead of punishment for suicide attempts.",
        "C": "Individuals who attempt suicide are presumed to have severe stress under the Act.",
        "D": "The Act encourages individuals to seek help without fear of legal consequences."
      },
      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: A) Suicide attempts were decriminalised as per IPC Section 309 Explanation: Prior to the Mental Healthcare Act, 2017 Indian Penal Code (IPC) Section 309: Attempting suicide was historically a criminal offence in India, punishable by imprisonment, fine, or both. This criminalisation treated suicide attempts as violations of law rather than issues of mental health. Change with the Mental Healthcare Act, 2017 Section 115 explicitly states that individuals who attempt suicide shall not be punished under IPC Section 309. (Option B ruled out) Instead, they are presumed to be experiencing severe stress linked to mental illness (Option C ruled out) and should receive care, treatment, and rehabilitation to prevent recurrence. This shift promotes a compassionate, health-centric approach , emphasizing the need for psychiatric help rather than imprisonment. Mental healthcare professionals are now mandated to provide appropriate psychosocial support and treatment for underlying mental health conditions. This act also helps reduce the stigma associated with mental illness, encouraging individuals to seek help without fear of legal repercussions.

      "question": "A 12-year-old girl presents with social withdrawal, anxiety, and bruises. She discloses inappropriate behaviour by her neighbour, and examination reveals signs of possible sexual abuse. What should the healthcare provider do immediately?",
      "options": {
        "A": "Refer the patient to a psychiatrist for evaluation.",
        "B": "Document the findings and schedule a follow-up appointment.",
        "C": "Report the suspected abuse to the appropriate authorities.",
        "D": "Discuss the situation with the patient’s parents before taking any action"
      },
      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: C) Report the suspected abuse to the appropriate authorities. Explanation: When a healthcare provider suspects sexual abuse in a child, the immediate action is to report the suspected abuse to the appropriate authorities. Under the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (POCSO) Act, 2012 , individuals aware of an incident of child sexual abuse are legally required to inform the local police or the Special Juvenile Police Unit. Failure to do so is considered a punishable offence. This Act aims to strengthen the protection of children below 18 years from sexual abuse, encompassing both male and female victims. The following offences are covered: Penetrative Sexual Assault Sexual Assault Sexual Harassment Use of a Child in Pornography Refer the patient to a psychiatrist for evaluation (Option A): Psychiatric evaluation is important for the child's mental health, it should occur after reporting. Document the findings and schedule a follow-up appointment (Option B): Documentation and follow-up are also necessary but must be secondary to ensuring the child's safety by reporting the abuse. Discuss the situation with the patient’s parents before taking any action (Option D): Discussing the situation with the parents before reporting can compromise the investigation and may put the child at further risk.

      "explanation": "→ Anger → Bargaining → Depression → Acceptance Correct Answer: A) Shock and Denial → Anger → Bargaining → Depression → Acceptance despair, and longing for the deceased. It may also include a range of emotions and behaviours influenced by cultural and personal factors. Stages of Grief/Death and Dying: Kübler-Ross identified five common stages of emotional responses to impending death/Grief. Stage 1- Shock and Denial: Patients initially react with disbelief and may seek multiple opinions to validate their denial. Effective communication from healthcare providers is essential to reassure and inform patients and families. Stage 2- Anger: Patients often feel frustrated and angry as reality sets in, questioning their fate and sometimes blaming others. Providers should approach this anger with empathy, recognising it as a natural response. Stage 3- Bargaining: IIIIIII Patients may negotiate with healthcare providers or a higher power, promising to change behaviours for a better outcome. Reassuring them of comprehensive care, regardless of their actions, is crucial. Stage 4- Depression: IIIIIII Signs of clinical depression can emerge, including withdrawal and hopelessness. While some sadness is normal, significant depressive symptoms should be treated to maintain quality of life and hope. Stage 5- Acceptance: IIIIIII In this stage, patients accept their mortality, & realise death is inevitable. Open discussions about death can occur, and spiritual beliefs may provide comfort.
