      "question": "A 29-year-old woman with a history of self-harm, chronic emptiness, and unstable relationships often alternates between idealizing and devaluing others. What defense mechanism is most commonly observed in this disorder?",
      "options": {
        "A": "Sublimation",
        "B": "Splitting",
        "C": "Rationalization",
        "D": "Displacement"
      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Correct answer: B) Splitting Explanation: Splitting is a common defense mechanism in borderline personality disorder, where individuals view people or situations as either all good or all bad, contributing to their unstable relationships. BORDERLINE PERSONALITY DISORDER: General Characteristics More common in females than in males. Persons with BPD are often in a state of crisis, with frequent mood swings, shifting from being argumentative to depressed, and later feeling numb. They can experience short-lived psychotic episodes and their behavior is highly unpredictable, Self-Destructive Behaviors Repetitive self-destructive acts such as wrist slashing or self-mutilation, often to elicit help from others, express anger, or numb overwhelming emotions. Interpersonal Relationships Individuals with BPD have tumultuous interpersonal relationships, feeling both dependent on others and hostile toward them when frustrated. They cannot tolerate being alone and prefer companionship, even in unhealthy relationships. Identity and Emotional Experience Chronic feelings of emptiness, boredom, and a lack of a consistent sense of identity (identity diffusion) are common, with some complaining of feeling depressed despite fluctuating moods. Distorted Relationships Relationships are distorted, with others seen as either \"all good\" or \"all bad\" due to splitting , leading to idealization or devaluation of people. Defense Mechanism Projective identification is a common defense mechanism, where patients project unacceptable aspects of themselves onto others, inducing them to play the projected role. Treatment Dialectical behaviour therapy. Mentalization based therapy. Transference: Focussed Psychotherapy. Pharmacotherapy: Antipsychotics, antidepressants, mood stabilizers like carbamazepine. Sublimation (Option A) is a mature defense mechanism where individuals redirect unacceptable impulses or emotions into socially acceptable behaviors or activities. Rationalization (Option C) involves explaining away or justifying behaviors or feelings to make them seem more acceptable or less distressing. Displacement (Option D) involves shifting emotions from a threatening target to a safer one, such as expressing anger toward a friend instead of an authority figure.

      "question": "A 42-year-old man presents to the clinic, expressing concern over his frequent and uncontrollable urges to engage in sexual activities. He reports spending several hours per day on sexual pursuits, such as browsing explicit material and seeking multiple sexual partners. Despite attempts to limit his behavior, he continues to act out sexually, leading to significant distress and disruption in his work and personal relationships. He has no history of substance abuse or mood disorders. Which of the following is the most appropriate diagnosis?",
      "options": {
        "A": "Compulsive sexual behavior disorder",
        "B": "Bipolar disorder with hypersexuality",
        "C": "Borderline personality disorder",
        "D": "Sexual aversion syndrome"
      },
      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: A) Compulsive sexual behavior disorder Explanation: The patient’s report of spending several hours per day on sexual pursuits, despite efforts to limit these behaviours, fits the diagnosis of Compulsive sexual behavior disorder. Compulsive sexual behavior disorder: Included under impulse control disorders in ICD-11. Characterised by persistent failure to control intense, repetitive, sexual impulses resulting in repetitive sexual behaviours. The repetitive sexual activity becomes the focus of life and results in adverse life consequences. Bipolar disorder with hypersexuality (Option B): While hypersexuality can occur during manic episodes of bipolar disorder, this patient's symptoms are not clearly linked to mood fluctuations. Additionally, the patient’s behavior persists consistently, not only during periods of mania. Borderline personality disorder (Option C): The patient’s symptoms in this case are more consistent with an isolated compulsive behavior rather than the broader emotional and relational instability characteristic of BPD. Sexual aversion disorder (Option D): It involves the avoidance of sexual contact and a lack of interest related to sexual activity. In contrast, compulsive sexual behavior disorder involves uncontrollable sexual urges or behaviors that cause distress and impairment, as seen in this case.
