      "question": "A 21-year-old college student presents with feelings of anxiety. She explains that since starting college, she has become increasingly insecure about her weight, particularly after gaining a few kgs. To cope with the stress of her coursework and social pressures, she often binge-eats high-calorie snacks during late-night study sessions. After these episodes, she feels intense guilt and frequently induces vomiting to avoid weight gain. On physical examination, her BMI is measured at 16.5 kg/m and her heart rate is 70 beats per minute. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?",
      "options": {
        "A": "Anorexia nervosa",
        "B": "Bulimia nervosa",
        "C": "Binge eating disorder",
        "D": "Orthorexia nervosa"
      },
      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: A) Anorexia nervosa Explanation: The correct diagnosis is Anorexia nervosa due to: The patient's significantly low BMI of 16.5 kg/m². Having an intense fear of weight gain and a distorted body image, which are evident in the patient's anxiety about her weight after gaining a few pounds. The combination of binge eating followed by purging behaviors, such as self-induced vomiting, aligns with the criteria for the binge/purge subtype of anorexia nervosa. Anorexia Nervosa - Clinical Features: Restriction of Energy Intake Low body weight (Most characteristic feature) BMI <18.5kg/m² in adults BMI-for-age under 5th percentile in children/adolescents Intense Fear of Weight Gain Persistent fear of gaining weight or becoming obese Body Image Distortion Undue influence of body weight/shape on self-evaluation Inaccurate perception of being normal or overweight Amenorrhea Previously required but no longer necessary for diagnosis in DSM-5 or ICD-11 Peculiar Food Behaviors Hiding food Disposing of food in napkins Rearranging food on plate Collecting recipes and cooking for others Delayed sexual development Have poor sexual adjustment Adults may have decreased interest in sex. Gender prevalence More common in females than males Anorexia Nervosa - Medical Complications Vital signs Bradycardia, hypotension, hypothermia, poikilothermia General Muscle atrophy, loss of body fat Central nervous system Generalized brain atrophy with enlarged ventricles Cardiovascular Peripheral (starvation) edema, superior mesenteric artery syndrome Hematologic Anemia of starvation, leukopenia Gastrointestinal Decreased",

      "question": "A 22-year-old female who is an aspiring model presents with complaints of gastrointestinal discomfort and concerns about her weight. Since beginning her modeling career, she has become increasingly anxious about her body image, feeling pressure to maintain a slim figure to secure modeling opportunities. Recently, she has also started binge eating high-calorie foods during stressful periods, followed by feelings of guilt. To counteract this, she regularly uses over-the-counter laxatives, believing they help her feel thinner. Her BMI is measured at 17 kg/m² and her heart rate is 70 beats per minute. What is the most likely diagnosis?",
      "options": {
        "A": "Anorexia with dietary restriction",
        "B": "Anorexia with purging",
        "C": "Bulimia with purging",
        "D": "Binge eating disorder"
      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: B) Anorexia with purging Explanation: This patient is best diagnosed as anorexia (purging type). She exhibits significant weight control behaviors, including binge eating followed by laxative use, while also maintaining a low BMI. This aligns with the criteria for anorexia nervosa, particularly the binge-eating/purging type, where she engages in binge eating and compensatory behaviors such as purging (laxative use here) to manage her weight. Type of Anorexia Nervosa Characteristics Binge-Eating/Purging type Recurring purging behaviors (e.g., laxative, diuretic abuse, self-induced vomiting) Episodes of binge eating Occurs at least once a week over the last 3 months Restricting type Primary behaviors include dieting, fasting, and/or excessive exercise No recurring purging behaviors or binge eating over the last 3 months Anorexia with dietary restriction (Option A): While this option describes a subtype of anorexia, it specifically refers to individuals who do not engage in binge eating or purging behaviors. Bulimia with purging (Option C): Bulimia nervosa is characterized by recurrent episodes of binge eating followed by inappropriate compensatory behaviors (like purging) but typically occurs in individuals with a normal or higher weight. Binge Eating Disorder (Option D): This is defined by recurrent episodes of binge eating without compensatory behaviors. This patient does engage in binge eating, but she also uses laxatives to prevent weight gain. Reference: Kaplan & Sadock’s Synopsis of Psychiatry, 12th Edition, Page 1504",

      "question": "A 19-year-old female presents with significant anxiety about gaining weight. She has a BMI of 16 kg/m² and she engages in excessive exercise. During the consultation, she reports feeling isolated from her friends and family, who are worried about her health. What is the most appropriate next best step for this patient?",

        "D": "Nutritional counseling with a focus on portion control"
      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: B) Supervised feeding with individual psychotherapy Explanation: The patient exhibits symptoms consistent with Anorexia nervosa, characterized by significant anxiety about weight gain, a low BMI (16 kg/m²), and excessive exercise. A supervised feeding program ensures the patient receives adequate nutrition, while individual psychotherapy addresses her psychological issues and promotes healthier eating behaviors. Indications for Inpatient Care: (Option C) Weight for height- 20% below normal Temperature <35.5°C Bradycardia (heart rate <50 beats per minute) Blood pressure <80/50 mmHg Postural hypotension (>20 mmHg drop) Arrhythmias Postural tachycardia (>20 beats per minute increase) Electrolyte abnormalities (e.g., hypokalemia, hyponatremia) Hypoglycemia Neutropenia (low white blood cell count) Management: Management Type Details Non-Pharmacological Management Individual Psychotherapy Focus on behavior modification and improving body image. Supervised Feeding Structured meal plans in a monitored setting to ensure nutritional intake. Nutritional Rehabilitation Educating patients about nutrition and healthy eating patterns. Counseling to address maladaptive thoughts and attitudes toward food and body image. Family Support Involvement of family members to provide emotional support and understanding. Treat Life-Threatening Complications Address any medical complications (e.g., electrolyte imbalances, dehydration) as necessary. Pharmacological Treatment SSRIs Can be prescribed to help induce weight gain and manage underlying anxiety or depression. Olanzapine May be considered if there is no adequate response to psychotherapy or SSRIs. Bupropion (Option A) Contraindicated in patients with anorexia or bulimia due to the increased risk of seizures. Nutritional counseling with a focus on portion control (Option D): is inadequate because it does not sufficiently address her psychological issues, which are crucial in her treatment.

      "question": "A 15-year-old boy presents to the hospital with lethargy and giddiness. He has a history of being bullied at school due to his physical appearance, which led him to become increasingly interested in various forms of exercise. Over the past three months, he has lost 24 kilograms due to exercise. An ECG performed upon admission is shown below. He appears cachectic and pale. He is assessed by a dietitian and started on nutritional supplements. Two days later, the patient exhibits involuntary muscle contractions, followed by periods of unresponsiveness and confusion. Which electrolyte abnormality would most likely be seen in this patient?",

      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: A) Hypophosphatemia Explanation: This is a case of Anorexia nervosa, as evidenced by the 15-year-old boy's significant weight loss, cachectic appearance, and bradycardia observed on his ECG. He began a nutritional rehabilitation program to address his malnutrition which led to refeeding syndrome as evidenced by the complication of seizure (involuntary muscle contractions, followed by periods of unresponsiveness and confusion) Refeeding Syndrome Refeeding syndrome is a potentially life-threatening condition that can occur in significantly malnourished patients when they are reintroduced to calories, particularly carbohydrates, after a period of starvation or very low caloric intake.

      "question": "A 22-year-old female medical student presents with a preoccupation with her body image that has persisted since age 13. She describes engaging in constant mirror checking and spending significant time scrutinizing her reflection. However, she acknowledges that her friends and family do not notice any flaws in her appearance and often compliment her. She reports episodes of binge eating followed by engaging in excessive exercise twice a week, for the past 6 months. She expresses significant emotional distress, stating, “I feel like I can’t stop myself from overeating, and then I panic about gaining weight”. What is the most likely diagnosis?",

        "D": "Obsessive-compulsive Disorder"
      },
      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: A) Bulimia nervosa Explanation: The most likely diagnosis is Bulimia Nervosa. She exhibits episodes of binge eating, characterized by consuming large amounts of food followed by feelings of guilt, which she attempts to counteract with excessive exercise. Binge Eating Episodes Recurring episodes of binge eating, occurring at least weekly for the last 3 months. Compensatory Behaviors Purging behaviors (self-induced vomiting, laxative abuse, diuretics), excessive exercise, fasting. BMI Often normal or slightly overweight (compared to anorexia nervosa). Gender prevalence More common in females than males Physical Signs Parotid gland hypertrophy (may see increased serum amylase) Enamel erosion (from vomiting) Mallory-Weiss syndrome (esophageal tears) These signs appear due to repeated purging. Electrolyte Disturbances Commonly hypokalemia and hypochloremia. Metabolic Changes Metabolic alkalosis due to vomiting. Physical Findings Dorsal hand calluses from induced vomiting (Russell sign). Binge-eating Disorder (Option B): This would involve binge eating without compensatory behaviors (excessive exercise), which she does exhibit. Body dysmorphic Disorder (Option C): Her concerns are more related to her eating behavior rather than a specific perceived defect. Obsessive-compulsive Disorder (Option D): Although her constant mirror checking could suggest OCD, the primary focus on binge eating and compensatory behaviors aligns more with Bulimia nervosa.",

      "question": "A 30-year-old woman presents with symptoms of anxiety that have persisted for the past six months. She is seeking medication to help manage her symptoms. Her medical history is unremarkable; she is non-diabetic, non-hypertensive, and has no family history of medical illnesses except for a recent history of bulimia nervosa. Given her background, which of the following medications would pose the highest risk of side effects if prescribed?",
      "options": {
        "A": "Escitalopram",
        "B": "Duloxetine",
        "C": "Venlafaxine",
        "D": "Bupropion"
      },
      "correct_answer": "D",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: D) Bupropion Explanation: Bupropion is contraindicated in individuals with a history of eating disorders, including bulimia nervosa, due to an increased risk of seizures. This risk arises from the potential for electrolyte imbalances caused by purging behaviors, which can be exacerbated by bupropion's mechanism of action. Treatment for Bulimia Nervosa Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT): This is the first-line treatment, focusing on modifying distorted thoughts and behaviors related to eating and body image. Nutritional Rehabilitation: Aimed at restoring healthy eating patterns and addressing nutritional deficiencies. Antidepressants: Fluoxetine: The most effective medication for reducing binge-eating episodes and associated symptoms. Topiramate: This can be effective in suppressing binge eating, but not as commonly used as fluoxetine. Bupropion: Contraindicated due to an increased risk of seizures, especially in patients with eating disorders. Evidence indicates that CBT and medications (particularly fluoxetine) are the most effective combination. Escitalopram, Duloxetine, and Venlafaxine (Option A, B, and C): are generally considered safer options for treating anxiety in patients with a history of eating disorders.

      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: B) Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) Explanation: Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) is the first-line treatment for Binge Eating Disorder (BED), helping to reduce binge eating episodes and associated psychological problems like depression, although it may not consistently lead to weight loss. Binge Eating Disorder (BED) BED involves frequent binges , often without physical hunger. Binges occur in private, typically involving high-calorie foods . Individuals feel a lack of control during these episodes. It is more common in females than males. It is the most common eating disorder. Etiology: Less is known about the causes compared to anorexia and bulimia. Risk factors: Childhood obesity Mood disorders Negative family dynamics Dietary restriction may trigger binge eating, but some experience binges without restriction, often triggered by emotional stress . Diagnostic Criteria Recurrent binge episodes at least once a week for three months . At least three of the following behaviors: Eating faster than usual Eating until feeling overly full Eating when not hungry Eating alone to avoid embarrassment Feelings of guilt or disgust after eating BED differs from bulimia as there are no compensatory behaviors (e.g., purging). BED patients typically have average to obese body weight, unlike anorexia. Comorbidity Comorbid Conditions Additional Associations Mood disorders Unstable weight (frequent weight cycling ) Anxiety disorders Insomnia Substance use disorders Early menarche Obesity (nearly half) Chronic pain in neck, shoulders, or back Risk of obesity-related issues Metabolic disorders Treatment Psychotherapy Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) : Most effective, first-line treatment. Reduces binge eating and depression but may not lead to weight loss. Enhanced with SSRIs or exercise. Interpersonal Psychotherapy (IPT) : Addresses interpersonal issues contributing to BED. (Option C) Dialectical Behavior Therapy (DBT) : Some evidence supports its use for BED. Psychopharmacotherapy Medication Effectiveness Lisdexamfetamine (Option A) Effective for weight loss and reducing binges Antidepressants Improve binge episodes but don't cause sustained weight loss Topiramate & Zonisamide (Option D) Moderate weight loss and reduced binge episodes Combined CBT + Medication More effective for weight loss than medication or CBT alone Reference: Kaplan & Sadock’s Synopsis of Psychiatry, 12th Edition, Pages 1509, 1510, 1514, 1516",

The boy does not express any fear of weight gain and has not experienced significant weight loss. Which of the following characteristics most likely indicates that he is suffering from Avoidant Restrictive Food Intake Disorder (ARFID)?",
      "options": {
        "A": "Intense fear of gaining weight leading to severe caloric restriction",

        "D": "Engagement in binge-eating episodes followed by purging behavior"
      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "to food Correct Answer: B) Disturbance in eating patterns due to sensory sensitivities or aversive reactions to food Explanation: ARFID is characterized by limited food intake due to sensory sensitivities or lack of interest in food, which aligns with the symptoms presented. Avoidant Restrictive Food Intake Disorder (ARFID) ARFID is a recent diagnosis in eating disorders, marked by: Persistent failure to meet nutritional and/or energy needs. Lack of fear of weight gain or drive for thinness, differentiating it from anorexia nervosa (AN). Limited food variety leading to nutritional deficiencies and psychosocial impairment. Clinical Features and Diagnosis Feature Description Eating Patterns Symptoms arise from sensory sensitivities, lack of interest, or aversive reactions to certain foods, not body image concerns. Demographics Patients are generally younger with less weight loss before treatment; often depend on enteral nutrition and may have longer hospital stays. Comorbidities Overlap with other eating disorders, especially in adolescents; some develop traditional eating disorder psychopathology alongside ARFID symptoms. Treatment Approaches Treatment Description Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) Incorporates systematic desensitization and cognitive restructuring, showing improvement in food acceptance and reduced anxiety related to eating. Family-Based Therapy Involves family members in treatment, aiding in maintaining progress at home. Pharmacological Treatments Some medications are being researched to alleviate associated anxiety or comorbid conditions. Intense fear of gaining weight leading to severe caloric restriction (Option A) ARFID does not involve fear of gaining weight or a drive for thinness, which are characteristics of anorexia nervosa. Compulsive exercise to maintain a specific body weight (Option C) is incorrect because compulsive exercise is more associated with anorexia nervosa or bulimia nervosa. Engagement in binge-eating episodes followed by purging behavior (Option D) Binge-eating followed by purging is indicative of bulimia nervosa, not ARFID.

      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "episodes during sleep , often with impaired awareness or amnesia . A hallmark feature is the consumption of unusual or even non-edible items (e.g., soap, raw meat, cigarettes). Night-Eating Syndrome (NES) is characterized by conscious, delayed eating patterns , including evening hyperphagia and nocturnal awakenings with food intake , but the person is aware and typically does not eat non-food items . Night-Eating Syndrome vs. Sleep-Related Eating Disorder Feature Night-Eating Syndrome (NES) Sleep-Related Eating Disorder (SRED) Awareness during episodes Preserved (fully awake and aware) Absent or impaired (amnesia common) Time of eating Late evening or during night awakenings During sleep, often within parasomnia episodes Control over eating Volitional Involuntary Items consumed Normal food Non-edible or dangerous items often consumed Association with other EDs May coexist with BED or depression May be comorbid with sleep disorders Higher prevalence of comorbid bulimia nervosa and binge-eating disorder (Option A): Incorrect. While NES may co-occur with BED, this is not the best distinguishing feature compared to SRED. Lack of concern about body image or weight (Option C): Incorrect. Both conditions may present with or without concern about weight, and it’s not a core differentiator. Increased risk of developing obesity and metabolic syndrome (Option D): Incorrect. Both NES and SRED can lead to weight gain and metabolic issues, so this is not unique to either. Reference: Kaplan & Sadock’s Synopsis of Psychiatry, 12th Edition, Pages 1514, 1515",
