      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: C) Replacement Explanation: Replacement is not a recognised defence mechanism. Defence mechanisms are unconscious strategies used by the ego to cope with internal conflicts between the id (instinctual desires) and the superego (moral standards). These mechanisms help protect the individual from anxiety and emotional discomfort. Examples include Sublimation (channelling unacceptable impulses into socially acceptable activities), Displacement (redirecting emotions to a safer target), and Altruism (helping others to reduce personal distress). Defence mechanisms are classified as: Narcissistic Immature Neurotic defences Mature defences Projection Denial Blocking Acting out Regression Introjection Projective identification Passive aggressive Somatisation Inhibition Intellectualisation Isolation of affect Displacement (Option B ruled out) Dissociation Undoing Rationalisation Reaction formation Repression Altruism (Option D ruled out) Anticipation Asceticism Sublimation (Option A ruled out) Suppression Humor All the mechanisms are unconscious except suppression.

      "question": "Which of the following is not a management approach used for a violent patient in psychiatry?",
      "options": {
        "A": "BZD",
        "B": "CBT",
        "C": "ECT",
        "D": "Haloperidol"
      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer B - CBT CBT (Cognitive Behavioral Therapy) is a psychotherapeutic approach that focuses on identifying and modifying negative thoughts, beliefs, and behaviours. While CBT is effective in treating a wide range of psychiatric conditions, it is not typically the primary intervention for managing an acutely violent patient. In the immediate management of violent behaviour, other interventions, such as medications and ensuring the safety of the patient and others, are usually prioritised. BZD (Benzodiazepines) (Option A) are sedative medications used to manage anxiety, agitation, and acute aggression. Though not the first-line choice for violent behaviour in psychiatric patients due to their sedative effects, they can be effective in calming agitated patients and creating a safer environment. ECT (Electroconvulsive Therapy) (Option C) involves inducing controlled seizures using electric currents to the brain and is primarily used for severe psychiatric conditions like depression, catatonia, or certain psychoses. Although not a first-line treatment for violent behaviour, it may be considered in cases of severe agitation or aggression unresponsive to other interventions, including medication. Haloperidol (Option D) . Haloperidol is an antipsychotic medication commonly used in psychiatry. It belongs to the class of typical antipsychotics and is known for its sedative and antipsychotic properties. Haloperidol can be used to manage acute agitation and aggression in psychiatric patients. It is often administered in emergency settings to rapidly control violent behaviour.

      "question": "What is the term used to describe the occurrence when a therapist experiences a combination of conscious and unconscious emotions towards their patient during psychotherapy?",
      "options": {
        "A": "Countertransference",
        "B": "Transference",
        "C": "Dissociation",
        "D": "Preoccupation"
      },
      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: A) Countertransference Explanation: Countertransference occurs when a therapist unintentionally projects their personal feelings and experiences onto their patient during psychotherapy. Countertransference is a process of the physician unconsciously displacing the patient's pattern of behaviour or emotional reactions like he/she were a significant figure from earlier in the physician's life. Ideally, therapists are expected to remain calm and unbiased, avoiding interference from their emotions and history. However, countertransference can lead to therapists having mixed conscious and unconscious feelings toward their patients. Supervision and personal therapy can help the psychiatrist identify and deal with this issue. Transference (Option B) refers to the patient's unconscious redirection of feelings and emotions from past relationships onto the therapist during therapy. Dissociation (Option C) is a defence mechanism where a person detaches or disconnects from their thoughts, emotions, or experiences. It often occurs as a response to trauma or overwhelming situations. Preoccupation (Option D) is an intense and persistent focus or preoccupation with a specific thought, feeling, or idea, often interfering with daily functioning and causing distress.

While CBT is effective in treating a wide range of psychiatric conditions, it is not typically the primary intervention for managing an acutely violent patient. In the immediate management of violent behavior, other interventions such as medications and ensuring the safety of the patient and others are usually prioritized. Incorrect Option: Option A. BZD (Benzodiazepines): Benzodiazepines are a class of medications that have sedative properties and are commonly used to treat anxiety, agitation, and acute aggression. While they are not typically the first-line choice for managing violent behavior in psychiatric patients due to their potential to cause sedation and impair judgment, they can still be used in specific situations. Benzodiazepines can help calm agitated patients, reducing their aggressive tendencies and facilitating a safer environment Option C. ECT (Electroconvulsive Therapy): ECT is a medical procedure that involves the induction of controlled seizures through the administration of electric currents to the brain. It is primarily used in the treatment of severe psychiatric conditions such as severe depression, catatonia, or some forms of psychosis. While ECT is not a first-line intervention for immediate management of violent behavior, it can be considered in certain cases. For example, if a patient presents with severe agitation, aggression, or a risk of harm to themselves or others, and their symptoms are not responding to other treatments, including medication. Option D. Haloperidol: Haloperidol is an antipsychotic medication commonly used in psychiatry. It belongs to the class of typical antipsychotics and is known for its sedative and antipsychotic properties. Haloperidol can be used to manage acute agitation and aggression in psychiatric patients.
