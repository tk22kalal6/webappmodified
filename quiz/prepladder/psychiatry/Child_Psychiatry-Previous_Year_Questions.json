      "question": "A 6-year-old boy was presented in the psychiatric OPD with complaints of inattention at school, hitting his friends and excessive talking, poor academic performance, and inability to sit in a place for a long time. What drug is used in the management of this disorder?",
      "options": {

        "D": "Amitriptyline"
      },
      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: A) Methylphenidate Explanation: The given scenario featuring inattention, aggression, excessive talking, poor academic performance, and difficulty sitting still suggests Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) , which is managed with methylphenidate. Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) Aetiology Genetic Factors: Runs in families, with parents or siblings more likely to have the condition (DAT1 gene and DRD4 gene). Neurochemical Factors: Linked to dopamine dysfunction and noradrenergic system. Neurophysiological Factors: EEG usually shows theta and beta waves in the frontal brain. Neuroanatomical Factors: Decreased activity in brain areas like the prefrontal cortex, anterior cingulate, and basal ganglia. Developmental Factors: Prenatal and perinatal factors, such as premature birth, maternal infections during pregnancy, and low birth weight, may increase the risk. Psychosocial Factors: Severe abuse, neglect, or maltreatment can worsen or mimic ADHD symptoms. Clinical features Hyperactivity: Restlessness, difficulty remaining seated, inappropriate running and climbing, excessive talking, interrupting others. Attention Deficit: Short attention span, distractibility, difficulty following instructions, forgetfulness, disorganisation, procrastination. Impulsivity: Acting without thinking, difficulty waiting for their turn, interrupting others, blurting out answers. Other: Emotional lability, explosiveness, irritability, memory and thinking defects, specific learning difficulties, speech and Hearing deficits. Diagnosis For an ADHD diagnosis to be confirmed , symptoms must be present in at least two different environments , such as both school and home. This ensures that the behaviour is not limited to one specific context and indicates a broader issue with attention and self-regulation. Treatment Pharmacotherapy Stimulant Medication: Methylphenidate (1st drug of choice) Amphetamine (2nd drug of choice) Modafinil ( not FDA-approved ) (Option B ruled out) Non-stimulant medication Atomoxetine Bupropion ( not FDA-approved for ADHD ) Psychosocial interventions Atenolol (Option C) is a beta-blocker which is used in the treatment of hypertension. It has no role in the management of ADHD. Amitriptyline (Option D) belongs to the class of tricyclic antidepressant drugs (TCA). It has no role in the management of ADHD.

ASD diagnosis focuses on social communication difficulties and restricted behaviors, not cognitive abilities. Incorrect Options: Option A - Abnormalities in social communication: This is included in diagnosing ASD. Individuals with ASD typically have difficulties with social communication, such as challenges in understanding and using verbal and non-verbal communication. Option C - Abnormality in socialization: This is included in diagnosing ASD. Abnormalities in socialization, such as difficulty in developing, maintaining, and understanding relationships, are a key component of ASD diagnosis. Option D - Restricted pattern of behaviour and interest: This is included in diagnosing ASD. Individuals with ASD often exhibit restricted and repetitive patterns of behavior, interests, or activities. This is a core criterion for ASD diagnosis.",

      },
      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer A - Trofinetide Trofinetide is a new drug approved for Rett syndrome. It is a synthetic analogue of glycine-proline-glutamate, a naturally occurring peptide. The exact mechanism is unknown, but it may have anti-inflammatory and trophic effects. Clinical trials have shown promising results, with improvements in certain Rett syndrome symptoms. Ambien (Option B) , generic name: zolpidem, is a sedative medication primarily used for the treatment of insomnia. Lunesta (Option C) , generic name: eszopiclone, is another sedative medication used for the treatment of insomnia. Similar to Ambien, GHB opioids (Option D) is a central nervous system depressant (gamma-hydroxybutyrate) that has been used recreationally and has sedative effects. Opioids, on the other hand, are a class of medications used for pain relief. Neither GHB nor opioids are approved drugs specifically indicated for the treatment of Rett syndrome.

      "question": "What should be the treatment approach for a 7-year-old child who has been experiencing bed-wetting about twice a week for the past year, following a thorough investigation to exclude any underlying organic cause?",
      "options": {
        "A": "Pharmacotherapy with imipramine",
        "B": "Psychodynamic psychotherapy",
        "C": "Bladder training, with the reward for delaying micturition during daytime",
        "D": "Bell and pad-based classification conditioning"
      },
      "correct_answer": "D",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: D) Bell and pad-based classification conditioning Explanation: Bed-wetting, also known as nocturnal enuresis , is a common problem in children, often occurring during sleep. T The bell and pad method is the most appropriate first-line treatment for bed-wetting in children without organic causes. This method involves a moisture-sensitive pad attached to the child's underwear. When the child begins to wet the bed, the bell rings, waking them up and helping them associate the sensation of a full bladder with the action of waking up. Over time, this conditioning process helps the child learn to wake up before urinating, effectively reducing bed-wetting. Management of enuresis Behavioural modifications: Reassurance. Encourage voiding before bed. Restrict evening fluid intake (40% in the morning, 40% at noon, 20% after 6 PM). Avoid caffeinated drinks. Motivational Therapy: Use verbal praise and rewards for dry nights. Bell and pad method (Alarm Therapy). Medications: Short-Term: Oral desmopressin for immediate relief. Long-Term: Oxybutynin or tolterodine to reduce bladder contractions. Imipramine is avoided due to side effects (Option A ruled out) Psychodynamic psychotherapy (Option B) focuses on resolving unconscious conflicts but is not a first-line treatment for bed-wetting. This approach is not typically indicated for primary nocturnal enuresis, especially when there are no significant emotional or psychological factors contributing to the issue. Bladder training, with reward for delaying micturition during daytime (Option C) : While bladder training can be effective in treating daytime urinary issues, it is generally not as effective for nocturnal enuresis . It might improve bladder control but does not specifically address bed-wetting at night. Reference: Nelsonâ€™s Textbook of Paediatrics, 21st Edition, Pages 396 2547 2820,2821",

      "question": "What could be the diagnosis for a child who exhibits below-average mathematical skills despite having a normal IQ and age-appropriate learning abilities and remains unaffected by a year-long private mathematics tutoring?",
      "options": {
        "A": "ADHD",
        "B": "Mathematics learning disorder",
        "C": "Aspergers syndrome",
        "D": "Specific learning disorder"
      },
      "correct_answer": "D",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: D) Specific learning disorder Explanation: The child described is likely experiencing a Specific Learning Disorder (SLD), specifically with impairment in mathematics. This is a neurodevelopmental disorder characterised by persistent difficulties in learning and using academic skills despite normal intelligence, adequate educational opportunities, and appropriate interventions such as private tutoring. Features of SLD in Mathematics (Dyscalculia): Mathematical Difficulties: Problems with basic arithmetic operations, understanding numbers, or applying mathematical concepts. Persistence: The issues persist despite normal IQ and adequate learning in other areas. Impact on Daily Life: The difficulties impair academic achievement and daily functioning. Incorrect Options: ADHD (Option A) involves inattention, hyperactivity, or impulsivity affecting multiple domains, including academics. Poor math performance in ADHD stems from difficulty focusing, not from specific deficits in mathematical skills. Mathematics Learning Disorder (Option B): While this term describes the condition, it is not a standalone diagnosis in the DSM-5. Dyscalculia is a subtype of Specific Learning Disorder, making \"Specific Learning Disorder\" the correct and broader diagnostic term. Aspergerâ€™s Syndrome (Option C) (now classified under Autism Spectrum Disorder in DSM-5) involves difficulties with social communication and restricted interests, not specific academic skills like mathematics. Children with Aspergerâ€™s often excel academically, including in mathematics. Reference: Kaplan and Sodockâ€™s Synopsis of Psychiatry, 12th Edition, Page 422, 423, 429, 430, 431, 601",

      "question": "The likely diagnosis for a girl who exhibits typical language milestones but primarily focuses on observing her own hands and lacks interaction with others is:",
      "options": {
        "A": "ADHD",
        "B": "Autism",
        "C": "Asperger's syndrome",
        "D": "Rett's syndrome"
      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: B) Autism Explanation: Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) is a neurodevelopmental condition characterised by: Core Features : Impaired social communication : Difficulty in forming or understanding relationships, reduced social-emotional reciprocity, and challenges in non-verbal communication. Restricted and repetitive behaviours : These include hand movements, insistence on sameness, fixated interests, or unusual sensory responses. Language Development : While some children with ASD exhibit language delays, others, particularly those previously categorised under Asperger's syndrome (now under ASD in DSM-5), meet typical language milestones but struggle with the social use of language. Behaviour Described in Question : The focus on observing her own hands is a classic example of repetitive and self-stimulatory behaviour. The lack of social interaction fits the hallmark features of difficulty in social reciprocity and relationships seen in ASD. Incorrect Options: ADHD (Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder) (Option A) is a neurodevelopmental disorder characterised by difficulties with attention, impulsivity, and hyperactivity. Individuals with ADHD may display problems in social interactions and exhibit certain repetitive behaviours. Aspergerâ€™s syndrome (Option C) Previously considered a separate diagnosis, it is now included under ASD in the DSM-5. Typically involves normal to advanced language development but significant social interaction difficulties. Lack of repetitive hand-focused behaviour makes this less likely than Autism. Rett's Syndrome (Option D) is a rare genetic disorder that predominantly affects females. It is characterised by severe cognitive and physical impairments, loss of purposeful hand skills, and the development of repetitive hand movements.

      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer B - Conduct disorder. Explanation : Disorder Oppositional Defiant Disorder (ODD) Conduct Disorder Definition The persistent pattern of negativistic, defiant, disobedient, and hostile behaviour toward authority figures. (Option A ruled out) A persistent pattern of behaviour involving aggression, violating others' rights, and disregarding social norms. (Option B) Diagnostic Criteria (DSM-5) Duration: â‰¥ 6 months. Symptoms ( â‰¥ 4): Losing temper. Easily annoyed/sensitive. Angry/resentful. Argues with authority figures. Refuses requests/rules. Deliberately annoys others. Blames others for their own mistakes/behaviors. Spiteful/vindictive (at least 2x in 6 months). No severely aggressive or delinquent behaviours. Duration : â‰¥ 12 months, with 1 symptom present in the last 6 months. Symptoms ( â‰¥ 3) : Physical aggression or threats. Destruction of property. Deceitfulness or theft. Harming animals. Violation of rules (e.g., truancy, running away). Types (DSM-5) Angry/Irritable Mood: Frequent temper loss, persistent irritability. Argumentative/Defiant Behavior: Argues, refuses to comply, blames others. Vindictiveness: Spiteful/vindictive actions â‰¥ 2x in 6 months. Childhood-onset : Symptoms before age 10. Adolescent-Onset : Symptoms after age 10. Unspecified-Onset : Age of onset unknown Severity Specifiers Mild: Symptoms in 1 setting. Moderate: Symptoms in 2 settings. Severe: Symptoms in â‰¥ 3 settings. Mild : Few conduct problems, minor harm. Moderate : Intermediate symptoms. Severe : Many symptoms, significant harm caused. Treatment Family Interventions: Parent training in child management, reinforcing positive behaviour. Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT): Parents are taught to discourage the child's oppositional behaviour by not paying much attention to it. Parenting Techniques: Focus on reducing harsh punishment and increasing positive interactions. Psychosocial Interventions : Early intervention, CBT, school-based programs. Pharmacologic Interventions : Antipsychotics (risperidone, quetiapine), SSRIs for impulsivity/irritability, sodium valproate. Antisocial personality disorder (Option C) is diagnosed in adults (18 years and older), making it inappropriate to diagnose in a 13-year-old. While the childâ€™s behaviour may resemble ASPD, the diagnosis requires a history of symptoms extending into adulthood. Disruptive mood dysregulation (Option D) primarily involves severe temper outbursts and a consistently irritable mood, not the antisocial behaviours observed here. The childâ€™s actions, such as stealing and bullying, suggest Conduct Disorder rather than mood regulation issues.

      "explanation": "occurs typically around ages 1 to 3 years. During this stage, the child's focus of pleasure and development centers on the anal region. The main conflict of this stage is related to toilet training and the child's ability to control their bowel movements. The child learns to gain satisfaction from retaining and expelling feces. Incorrect Options: Option B - Oral Stage: The oral stage occurs during infancy (birth to around 1 year old). Pleasure centers on the mouth and the activities related to it, such as sucking and feeding. Fixation during this stage might result in behaviors like smoking, overeating, or a dependency on oral stimulation for comfort. Option C - Phallic Stage: The phallic stage emerges around ages 3 to 6 years. During this stage, children become aware of their own gender and develop feelings of attraction towards the opposite-sex parent and rivalry with the same-sex parent (Oedipus and Electra complexes). Fixation during this stage might lead to challenges in forming healthy relationships and issues related to gender identity and self-esteem. Option D - Genital Stage: The genital stage occurs from puberty onwards. This stage is characterized by the mature development of sexual interests and the establishment of healthy intimate relationships. Fixation during this stage might lead to difficulties in forming lasting relationships and a lack of fulfillment in adult sexual relationships. Reference: Prepladder Notes",
