Their frustration can hinder the development of a therapeutic alliance and limit their ability to benefit from the support offered. Incorrect Options: Option A - Person who is severely ill and is not cooperative: While challenging, supportive therapy can be adapted to gradually build cooperation and engage the patient over time . Option C - Person with cognitive and functional deficit: Supportive therapy can be tailored to address the needs of individuals with cognitive and functional deficits, providing practical support and adapting communication to their abilities. Option D - Person who is severely ill and has lost his ego function: Supportive therapy can be beneficial even for severely ill individuals by providing a structured and supportive environment, although the approach may need to be highly specialized.

      "question": "A patient with Alzheimer’s disease refused to take oral drugs. Which of the following drugs can be prescribed to this patient?",
      "options": {
        "A": "Memantine",
        "B": "Donepezil",
        "C": "Rivastigmine",
        "D": "Galantamine"
      },
      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer C - Rivastigmine In this scenario, a transdermal Rivastigmine patch can be used as an alternative, as it is the only option available in India. It is a reversible anticholinesterase used in the treatment of Alzheimer's disease. It is also available as a transdermal patch, which is applied to the skin and releases the medication gradually over 24 hours, ensuring a steady and continuous therapeutic effect. Treatment of Alzheimer’s disease Patient and caregiver education. Neurotransmitter-based therapies Acetylcholinesterase inhibitors Donepezil Rivastigmine Galantamine N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) glutamate receptor blocker Memantine A common approach to AD drug therapy is to initiate a cholinesterase inhibitor for a patient diagnosed with mild AD dementia and to add memantine when patients enter the moderate stage of the disease. Therapies targeting amyloid- I Aducanumab MOA: Monoclonal antibody targeting the N-terminus of the A β peptide Dosage: Intravenous infusion every 4 weeks (7 infusions in total) Should only be considered for treating MCI (Mild Cognitive Impairment) or early dementia due to AD S/E: Vasogenic cerebral edema, cortical microhemorrhages, and superficial siderosis Memantine (Option A) , an NMDA antagonist for moderate to severe Alzheimer's, regulates glutamate and is given orally. Treatment typically starts with a cholinesterase inhibitor for mild AD and adds memantine in the moderate stage, but it is only available in oral form. Donepezil (Option B) and Galantamine (Option D) are reversible anticholinesterase inhibitors used to treat mild to moderate Alzheimer's disease. While they are available in both oral and transdermal patch forms, only the oral forms are accessible in India, making them incorrect options.

      "question": "What was the intended function of thiopentone and succinylcholine given to a patient receiving ECT treatment for severe depression?",
      "options": {
        "A": "To bring a calming effect",
        "B": "To produce mood elevation",
        "C": "To induce anesthesia and relax muscles",
        "D": "To prevent memory loss after the ECT"
      },
      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer C - To induce anesthesia and relax muscles Electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) is a procedure used to treat severe depression, and it involves the administration of a general anaesthetic and a muscle relaxant. Thiopentone is an ultra-short-acting barbiturate that is used to induce anaesthesia, and Succinylcholine is a depolarising muscle relaxant that helps to prevent convulsions during the procedure. However , methohexital is the most commonly used anaesthetic because of its lower likelihood of postictal arrhythmias and shorter duration of action. To bring a calming effect (Option A) : The purpose of ECT is not to sedate or calm the patient but to induce a controlled seizure in the brain for therapeutic effects. To produce mood elevation (Option B) : The primary goal of ECT is to treat severe psychiatric conditions (like depression, mania, or catatonia) by using controlled seizures to induce neurochemical changes that help improve the patient's mood over time. However, mood elevation is not the primary effect. To prevent memory loss (Option D) : The medications used during ECT are not intended to prevent memory loss. These drugs serve to induce anaesthesia and relax muscles , which help the patient remain unconscious and prevent muscle contractions during the induced seizure.

      "question": "Which statement most accurately characterizes paradoxical suicide?",
      "options": {
        "A": "Suicide occurring at the time when the patient starts to recover",
        "B": "Suicide after taking low dose of drug",
        "C": "Accidental completion of suicide",
        "D": "None of the above"
      },
      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "Paradoxical suicide refers to a phenomenon where individuals take their own lives at a time when they appear to be improving or showing signs of recovery from a mental health condition. It is characterized by a sudden and unexpected act of suicide despite the apparent improvement in the person's mental state or circumstances. Incorrect Options: Option B: Suicide after taking a low dose of drug: This does not describe paradoxical suicide specifically. The dosage of the drug is not a defining factor in paradoxical suicide. Option C : Accidental completion of suicide: Paradoxical suicide is not accidental but rather a deliberate act. Option D : None of the above: This is an incorrect option as option A accurately describes paradoxical suicide. Reference: .",

      "question": "Under the Mental Health Care Act 2017, a patient has the right to choose his or her caretaker and future course of action in treatment. What is this provision known as?",
      "options": {
        "A": "Treatment directive",
        "B": "Mental will",
        "C": "Future directive",
        "D": "Advance directive"
      },
      "correct_answer": "D",
      "explanation": "\"advance directive.\" An advance directive is a legal document that allows individuals to specify their preferences regarding medical or mental health treatment in the future, particularly if they become incapable of making decisions at that time. It empowers individuals to express their wishes regarding treatment, including choosing a caretaker or outlining their desired course of action. Advance directives are meant to ensure that an individual's autonomy and preferences are respected and followed in the event of incapacity. Incorrect Options: Option A -Treatment directive: A treatment directive is a legal document that outlines a person's preferences for medical treatment in the event they become unable to make decisions for themselves. However, this term is not specifically associated with the Mental Health Care Act 2017. Option B -Mental will: \"Mental will\" is not a commonly used term or provision in the context of mental health legislation or the right to choose a caretaker and future course of action in treatment. Option C -Future directive: \"Future directive\" is a general term that could refer to a range of legal documents or provisions related to specifying preferences or instructions for future medical or mental health treatment. However, it is not a specific term associated with the Mental Health Care Act 2017. Reference: .",
