        "D": "Both genders have a refractory period after orgasm."
      },
      "correct_answer": "D",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: D) Both genders have a refractory period after orgasm.

Females do not have a refractory period and can often become aroused again quickly after orgasm. Phases of the sexual response cycle Desire phase Consists of sex fantasies and the desire to have sex Associated disorder: Hypoactive sexual desire disorder (HSDD) FDA drug approved to treat HSDD in premenopausal women Flibanserin- Partial 5HT1A agonist, oral drug Bremelanotide- Melanocortin receptor agonist, subcutaneous injection) Excitement Stage Muscles tense, heart rate and blood pressure increase. (Option A ruled out) Males: Penis becomes erect. Females: Vaginal walls become moist and wider; clitoris enlarges. Associated disorder: Male erectile dysfunction, Female Sexual arousal disorder Plateau Stage Breathing becomes faster; muscles continue to tense. Males: Glans swell; testes enlarge. (Option B ruled out) Females: Outer vagina contracts; clitoris retracts. Orgasm Stage Neuromuscular tension releases. Males: Penis contracts, ejaculating sperm and semen. Females: Vagina contracts rhythmically. (Option C ruled out) Associated disorder: Female orgasmic disorder, premature ejaculation, delayed ejaculation.

      "options": {

        "D": "Organic Erectile Dysfunction occurs in men with relationship issues."
      },
      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: C) Situational erectile disorder means he can achieve erections in certain situations. Incidence increases with age; reported in 2-8% of young adults and is more common in older men. Not universal in aging; factors like having a partner and consistent sexual activity are protective. (Option A) Episodes of erectile disorder can increase anxiety in future sexual encounters. Causes: Organic Causes: Due to medical conditions or medications. Medical Conditions: Cardiovascular diseases (hypertension, atherosclerosis, coronary artery disease), Diabetes mellitus, Neurological disorders (multiple sclerosis, Parkinson's disease, spinal cord injuries), Endocrine disorders (hypogonadism, hyperprolactinemia, thyroid dysfunction), Chronic kidney disease, Liver cirrhosis, Pelvic or prostate surgeries, Sleep disorders (obstructive sleep apnea). Medications: Antihypertensives (beta-blockers, thiazide diuretics), Antidepressants (SSRIs, tricyclic antidepressants), Antipsychotics (typical and atypical), Anti-androgens (finasteride, spironolactone), Opioids, Chemotherapy agents, Anticonvulsants, H2-receptor antagonists (cimetidine). Psychogenic Causes: More common in young and middle-aged men; often related to psychological factors such as fear, anxiety, or relationship issues. (Option D) Types of Male Erectile Disorder: Lifelong Male Erectile Disorder: Never able to achieve an erection sufficient for insertion. (Option B) Rare, occurring in about 1% of men under 35. Acquired Male Erectile Disorder: Previously able to achieve penetration but later unable to do so. Affects 10-20% of all men. Situational Male Erectile Disorder: Able to have erections in certain situations (e.g., with a sex worker) but not with a partner. Investigations used to record nocturnal erections are: Nocturnal penile tumescence Penile plethysmography (which measures blood pressure in the penis). These are used to differentiate between organic and psychogenic erectile dysfunction. Treatment of Erectile Dysfunction Pharmacotherapy Phosphodiesterase-5 inhibitors (PDE-5 inhibitors) Nitric oxide enhancers- facilitates blood flow into the penis and enhances erection. Drugs- Sildenafil, tadalafil, vardenafil and Avanafil. Not used along with organic nitrates- Can cause sudden fall in blood pressure and can be fatal. (Option B) Other medications: Oral phentolamine : May reduce sympathetic tone and relax muscles of corpora cavernosa and subsequently improve the erection. Alprostadil contains naturally occurring prostaglandin E (vasodilating agent). Alprostadil- Directly injected into corpora cavernosa or given intraurethral through a cannula as a pellet.",

The child shows a strong desire to be a different gender than the assigned sex. The child exhibits preferences for clothes, toys, and activities typical of the experienced gender. The duration of symptoms (2.5 years) exceeds the requirement of 2 years. The child shows distress when gender identity is not acknowledged (upset when referred to as a girl). The child is prepubertal. According to ICD-11 , gender dysphoria has been classified into: Gender incongruence of adolescence or adulthood (Option C) : A marked incongruence between an individual's experienced/expressed gender and assigned sex, lasting at least 6 months, manifesting in adolescence or adulthood.

      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: C) Vaginismus Explanation: Vaginismus is a constriction of the outer third of the vagina due to involuntary pelvic floor muscle tightening or spasm. It interferes with penile insertion and intercourse. Genito-Pelvic Pain/Penetration Disorder: In DSM-5, this disorder refers to one or more of the following complaints, of which any two or more may occur together: Difficulty having intercourse Genito-pelvic pain Fear of pain or penetration Tension of the pelvic floor muscles These pain disorders are diagnosed as dyspareunia or vaginismus: Dyspareunia (Option B): Recurrent or persistent genital pain occurring before, during, or after intercourse. Although they frequently coexist, it does not specifically involve involuntary muscle spasms making vaginismus a better answer here. Vaginismus: IIIIIII It is the constriction of the outer third of the vagina due to involuntary pelvic floor muscle tightening or spasm. It interferes with penile insertion and intercourse. Treatment: Dilating vagina (or) opening with fingers or with dilators. Dilators may also help in dyspareunia. Sexual aversion disorder (Option A) is characterized by a strong aversion to sexual activity, rather than physical pain during penetration. Vulvodynia (Option D) refers to chronic vulvar pain that is not associated with an identifiable cause, which can occur during sexual activity, but it is not primarily caused by muscle spasms.
