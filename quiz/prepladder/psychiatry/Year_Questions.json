      "correct_answer": "D",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer D - Delirium tremens. Explanation: The patient’s symptoms, including restlessness, tremors, tactile hallucinations (seeing insects crawling), a seizure, and a history of chronic alcoholism, strongly indicate delirium tremens (DT). It typically occurs 48–72 hours after cessation or reduction of alcohol use. It is a severe alcohol withdrawal syndrome characterised by tremors, agitation, confusion, and hallucinations. It is a medical emergency that requires immediate treatment. Clinical features of Alcohol Withdrawal Stage Symptoms Onset after last drink Mild withdrawal Mild anxiety Tremulousness Nausea Headache Palpitations 6-8 hours Moderate (Alcoholic hallucinosis) Visual, auditory, or tactile hallucinations Intact orientation Normal vital signs 8- 12 hours Severe (Withdrawal seizures) Generalized tonic-clonic seizures Usually brief and self-limited Also known as rum fits 12-24 hours Life threatening (Delirium tremens) Severe agitation Confusion and disorientation Hallucinations (often visual) Autonomic hyperactivity (tachycardia, hypertension, fever) Profound sweating Tremors Insomnia Within 72 hours ICU psychosis (Option A) is a mental health condition that can develop in ICU patients due to stress, sedatives, and other medications. Symptoms include hallucinations, delusions, and agitation. Unlike ICU psychosis, delirium tremens (DTs) result from alcohol withdrawal. Alcohol Intoxication (Option B): This diagnosis is unlikely since the patient has been sober for three days. Alcohol intoxication results from excessive alcohol consumption and presents with symptoms such as slurred speech, impaired coordination, confusion, and, in severe cases, loss of consciousness or even death. The patient's current symptoms are more consistent with alcohol withdrawal rather than intoxication. Wernicke-Korsakoff psychosis (Option C) is a neurological disorder caused by thiamine (vitamin B1) deficiency. It presents with symptoms such as confusion, memory loss, and ataxia. Wernicke's encephalopathy represents the acute phase, while Korsakoff's syndrome is the chronic stage. The disorder's main features are problems in acquiring new information or establishing new memories and in retrieving previous memories.

It typically follows Wernicke’s encephalopathy and is marked by severe memory problems, including amnesia, confabulation, lack of insight, and apathy. Unlike acute conditions, it is characterized by chronic memory deficits rather than symptoms like tremors, hallucinations, disorientation, or hypertension. Marchiafava-Bignami disease (Option D) is a rare condition in chronic alcoholics, characterized by demyelination of the corpus callosum and surrounding white matter, leading to severe neurological deficits. Symptoms include seizures, dysarthria, spasticity, and progressive cognitive impairment. Acute symptoms like disorientation, tremors, hallucinations, and hypertension are not typical, as the disease primarily presents with chronic, progressive neurological symptoms.

      "correct_answer": "D",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: D) Cocaine Explanation: Cocaine is most commonly associated with black pigmentation of the tongue and tactile hallucinations. The black pigmentation of the tongue is known as \"black tongue,\" and it occurs due to a condition called black hairy tongue. It is characterised by elongation of the filiform papillae on the tongue, which can appear black or dark brown. Tactile hallucinations, also known as formication, are a common symptom of cocaine use and can involve sensations of insects crawling on or under the skin. Incorrect Options: Heroin (Option A) is an opioid drug derived from morphine. Black pigmentation of the tongue is not typically associated with heroin use. Heroin use may cause other physical symptoms, such as constricted pupils, drowsiness, and respiratory depression. Opium (Option B) is another opioid drug derived from the poppy plant. Opium use can lead to symptoms such as sedation, euphoria, and constipation but is not associated with black pigmentation of the tongue. Alcohol (Option C) consumption does not typically cause black pigmentation of the tongue. Excessive alcohol intake can have various effects on the body, including impaired judgment, motor coordination, and liver damage.

      "explanation": "Correct Answer: D) Alcoholic hallucinosis. Explanation: The most likely diagnosis is Alcoholic Hallucinosis , given the patient’s history of alcohol consumption, auditory hallucinations, preserved orientation, stable vital signs, and recent surgical stress. Alcoholic hallucinosis is a complication of chronic alcohol use , characterised by the presence of hallucinations (usually auditory) during or shortly after heavy alcohol use or withdrawal. Incorrect Options: Delirium tremens (Option A) . A more severe withdrawal syndrome known as delirium tremens can affect alcohol users. Tremors, agitation, confusion, and hallucinations are some of its symptoms. Delirium tremens is a medical emergency that must be treated right away. Minor liquor withdrawal is described by the quake, nervousness, queasiness, spewing, and sleep deprivation. Significant liquor withdrawal signs and side effects incorporate visual mind flights and hearable pipedreams, entire body quake, heaving, diaphoresis, and hypertension (hypertension). A/c transient psychotic disorder (Option B) . Psychological stress can lead to the sudden onset of psychotic symptoms in Acute and Transient Psychotic Disorder (ATPD). In this, episodes are present moments, enduring from days to 90 days, trailed by complete abatement. Delusions, hallucinations, and mood swings are their hallmarks. Most of the time, transient psychotic disorder goes away on its own after a few weeks or a month. Delirium (Option C) . Delirium is a mental state in which you can't think clearly or remember anything, are lost, and are confused. There are many things that can cause delirium, such as an infection, taking medication, or going through a medical procedure. It usually appears out of nowhere. It is frequently brief and treatable.

      "explanation": "Correct Answer: B) Cocaine Cocaine abuse can lead to formication, which is the sensation of insects crawling under the skin. It is also called coke bugs or cocaine bugs This is a tactile hallucination commonly seen in stimulant-induced psychosis like cocaine. The drug increases dopamine levels in the brain, leading to altered sensory perceptions and pleasure. Cocaine Origin Leaves of Erythroxylum coca Erythroxylum coca plant Local names Coke, snow, Cadillac, White lady Physical properties Colourless, odourless, crystalline, bitter taste Mechanism of action It is a potent central nervous system (CNS) stimulant that produces initial euphoria and increased energy, followed by depression as its effects wear off. It enhances alertness and activity while stimulating the autonomic nervous system, leading to increased heart rate and elevated blood pressure. Route of administration Snorting, Smoking, IV injection Signs of abuse Septal perforation Crack hands (multiple blackened, hyperkeratotic lesions on the fingers and palms).

Heroin (Option C) is an opioid with effects that include euphoria, sedation, analgesia , and respiratory depression . It does not typically cause sensory distortions such as formication. Alcohol (Option D) is a CNS depressant, and its withdrawal in chronic alcoholics can lead to delirium tremens, which include visual hallucinations and delirium .

      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: C) Lorazepam + thiamine Explanation: The patient is showing signs of alcohol withdrawal delirium (delirium tremens), including disorientation and visual hallucinations. Delirium tremens is a severe withdrawal syndrome that occurs after sudden cessation of chronic alcohol consumption. It is characterised by confusion, agitation, hallucinations, autonomic hyperactivity and seizures. The appropriate treatment includes benzodiazepines (lorazepam) for withdrawal symptoms and thiamine to prevent neurological complications like Wernicke Encephalopathy or Korsakoff psychosis. Alcohol Withdrawal management Alcohol Withdrawal Treatment Mild or Moderate Withdrawal Treatment: Benzodiazepines (e.g., lorazepam, chlordiazepoxide, diazepam) . Short-acting (e.g., lorazepam) or long-acting (e.g., chlordiazepoxide, diazepam). Carbamazepine (daily doses of 800 mg) is also effective and has minimal abuse liability. Severe withdrawal (Seizures) Treatment of choice: Benzodiazepines Anticonvulsants are not more beneficial. Life threatening (Delirium Tremens) For extreme symptoms (delirium tremens or DTs), Higher doses of Benzodiazepines (e.g., 50-100 mg chlordiazepoxide every 4 hours or lorazepam IV). Supportive care: High-calorie diet, multivitamins. Thiamine: to avoid Wernicke Encephalopathy or Korsakoff psychosis. (Option B ruled out) Haloperidol may be used for severe agitation but can lower the seizure threshold. (Option A and D ruled out) Protracted Withdrawal: Symptoms may last 2 to 6 months. Acamprosate may help diminish some symptoms. Cognitive and behavioural approaches are recommended. Reference: Kaplan & Sadock’s Synopsis of Psychiatry, 12th Edition, Pages 907-910, 915, 919, 920",

      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "food as they decrease its absorption Correct Answer: C) There should be a 15-minute gap between nicotine gum and coffee/soda/acidic food as they decrease its absorption Explanation: When a patient is using nicotine gum for nicotine substitution therapy, there should be a 15-minute gap between nicotine gum and coffee/soda/acidic food as they decrease its absorption. Treatment of Nicotine addiction Therapy Description Nicotine gum Smokers can use 1-2 gums per hour and a maximum of 24 gums per day. It releases nicotine by chewing and buccal absorption. Beverages like coffee, tea, soda, and juice should not be used during gum use because they decrease absorption. Poor compliance is a drawback. Nicotine lozenges Users must suck the lozenges until it is completely dissolved and must not swallow it. Useful for people who smoke immediately after awakening. It provides the highest level of nicotine compared to other nicotine replacement therapies. II Nicotine patches Attached to the skin Continuous delivery of nicotine and is available as 16 or 24-hour tapering preparations. It has good compliance. II Nicotine nasal spray Provides nicotine concentration in the blood similar to Smoking. Major adverse effects are rhinitis, watering eyes, and coughing II Nicotine inhaler Nicotine absorption occurs in the upper throat, not the lungs Non-nicotine medications II Bupropion (an antidepressant): It has dopaminergic and adrenergic actions. II Varenicline is a partial agonist of alpha-4 beta-2 nicotinic receptors. It blocks nicotine from binding to the receptor and decreases the rewarding aspects of cigarette smoking. It also stimulates the receptor and reduces withdrawal and cravings. Comes with a black box warning of serious neuropsychiatric events like agitation, mood changes, and suicidal thoughts. II Nortriptyline (Second-line drug) II Clonidine : It decreases the sympathetic activity from locus ceruleus and is useful in controlling withdrawal symptoms. Incorrect Options: Preferably given by gastrointestinal route (Option A). It is not true, as nicotine replacement therapy is administered through transdermal patches, lozenges, inhalers, nicotine gums, and nasal sprays. Varenicline comes with a black box warning of cardiovascular death (Option B): Varenicline helps reduce craving and withdrawal symptoms associated with smoking cessation. It comes with a black box warning of serious neuropsychiatric events like agitation, mood changes, and suicidal thoughts. Nicotine chewing gum is better for constant use as it gives a 25% higher blood level than lozenges (Option D): It is not valid, as nicotine gums and lozenges are equally effective, and one does not show a 25% higher blood level.

      "explanation": "Correct Answer C - Lorazepam + thiamine The patient exhibits symptoms of alcohol withdrawal with possible thiamine deficiency . Lorazepam, a short-acting benzodiazepine, is used to manage alcohol withdrawal symptoms such as agitation and hallucinations. Thiamine supplementation is essential to prevent or treat Wernicke-Korsakoff syndrome, a common complication of chronic alcoholism due to Vitamin B1 deficiency. This deficiency can lead to memory gaps and confabulation, where patients unintentionally create false stories to fill those gaps. Chronic alcohol use also impairs thiamine absorption, necessitating its replacement in these patients. Haloperidol (Options A and D) is indicated only when the symptoms and agitation are severe to control high doses of Benzodiazepines, and thiamine may not suffice. In those cases, we can add antipsychotics such as Olanzapine or Haloperidol. Lorazepam (Option B) Here, the patient also exhibits symptoms of thiamine deficiency, so Lorazepam alone does not suffice. Thiamine should be given along with lorazepam.

Delirium tremens is a severe withdrawal syndrome that occurs after sudden cessation of chronic alcohol consumption. It is characterized by confusion, agitation, hallucinations, autonomic hyperactivity and seizures. Seizures can occur suddenly; about 1% may experience a single grand mal convulsion, typically on the second day of withdrawal. Treatment of choice: Benzodiazepines. Anticonvulsants are not more beneficial. (Option C) : Naltrexone is an opioid antagonist used to treat alcohol dependence by reducing cravings, but it is not indicated in the acute withdrawal phase . It is more useful for maintaining abstinence once the patient has been stabilized and no longer requires acute management. (Options A & B) : Flupenthixol is an antipsychotic used to treat schizophrenia or other psychotic disorders, not alcohol withdrawal. Although the patient has auditory hallucinations and delusions, these are likely related to alcohol withdrawal, which should be treated with benzodiazepines.

Stage of Alcohol Withdrawal Symptoms Onset After Last Drink Treatment Mild Withdrawal Mild anxiety, tremulousness, nausea, headache, palpitations 6-8 hours Benzodiazepines (lorazepam, chlordiazepoxide, diazepam). Carbamazepine (800 mg daily). Moderate (Alcoholic Hallucinosis) Visual, auditory, or tactile hallucinations, intact orientation, normal vital signs 8-12 hours Benzodiazepines (lorazepam, chlordiazepoxide, diazepam). Severe (Withdrawal Seizures) Generalized tonic-clonic seizures, usually brief and self-limited (rum fits) 12-24 hours Benzodiazepines (Treatment of choice). Anticonvulsants not more beneficial. Life-Threatening (Delirium Tremens) Severe agitation, confusion, disorientation, visual hallucinations, autonomic hyperactivity, profound sweating, tremors, insomnia Within 72 hours Higher doses of Benzodiazepines ( 50-100 mg chlordiazepoxide every 4 hours or lorazepam IV). Supportive care (high-calorie diet, multivitamins). Haloperidol for severe agitation (caution with seizure threshold).

      "explanation": "Correct Answer: B) Disulfiram-like reaction Explanation: The patient's symptoms of red rashes, itching, and headache after consuming alcohol while on metronidazole suggest a Disulfiram-like reaction. This occurs when metronidazole interacts with alcohol, causing symptoms such as flushing, nausea, sweating, and headache, similar to the effects of disulfiram (Antabuse), which is used to discourage alcohol consumption. When alcohol is ingested by someone taking disulfiram, it inhibits the enzyme aldehyde dehydrogenase, leading to the accumulation of acetaldehyde in the blood, which causes unpleasant symptoms. Flushing Headache Nausea & vomiting Sweating Palpitations, chest pain, and dizziness Dyspnea Hypotension and circulatory collapse Drugs causing disulfiram-like reaction: (Mnemonic- CGMP) They are contraindicated in active drinkers.

Visual and tactile hallucinations are less common but may occur. Cocaine can cause formication/ Cocaine bugs (sensation of bugs crawling under the skin). Symptoms depend on dose, duration of use, and individual sensitivity to stimulants. More frequent in users of intravenous cocaine or crack cocaine. Psychotic symptoms are seen more in men than in women. Treatment: The preferred treatment is short-term use of antipsychotics like haloperidol, especially for amphetamine-induced psychosis. Oneroid state (Option A) refers to an impaired consciousness involving dream-like experiences with vivid perceptions, hallucinations, and delusions, leading to disorientation and difficulty distinguishing reality.

      },
      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer A - Conversion disorder La belle indifférence (“beautiful indifference”) is observed in conversion disorder. It refers to a patient's indifferent attitude toward severe symptoms (absence of psychological distress despite serious medical illness or symptoms). It is most commonly associated with conversion disorder (CD) or functional neurologic symptom disorder (FNSD) in DSM-5, though it can also occur in seriously ill patients with a stoic attitude. It is characterised by neurological deficits without medical or neurological etiology, incompatible with known disorders. For instance, the girl who is not able to see may be sitting very calmly. Panic disorder (Option B) is characterised by recurrent, unexpected panic attacks, which are sudden episodes of intense fear or discomfort accompanied by physical symptoms such as palpitations, sweating, trembling, and feelings of impending doom or losing control. Individuals with panic disorder typically experience significant distress and anxiety during panic attacks, which is contrary to the indifference seen in La Belle indifference. Schizophrenia (Option C) is a chronic mental disorder that involves a range of symptoms, including delusions, hallucinations, disorganised thinking, and emotional dysregulation. Individuals with schizophrenia usually experience distress and impairment due to their symptoms and are unlikely to exhibit the characteristic indifference associated with la belle indifférence. Depression (Option D) is a mood disorder characterised by persistent feelings of sadness, loss of interest or pleasure, and other symptoms such as changes in appetite, sleep disturbances, and thoughts of death or suicide. Individuals with depression typically experience emotional distress and are unlikely to display the indifference associated with la belle indifférence.

It can lead to memory loss, confusion, and even dementia if untreated. The deficiency affects myelin synthesis, causing demyelination and neuronal dysfunction. Vitamin C (Option A) : Its deficiency causes scurvy, presenting with symptoms like bleeding gums and weakness, but it is not linked to cognitive impairment. Vitamin B6 (Option C): While deficiency can cause irritability, depression, and confusion, it is less commonly associated with significant cognitive impairment in the elderly. Vitamin B1 (Thiamine) (Option D): Deficiency leads to Wernicke’s encephalopathy and Korsakoff’s syndrome, but these are less common causes of cognitive impairment in the general elderly population compared to B12 deficiency.

      "explanation": "Correct Answer: B) Acuity of onset and loss of consciousness Explanation: Delirium is characterised by a sudden and acute onset , often occurring over a short period of hours to days. The definition of delirium is an acute decline in both the level of consciousness and cognition with particular impairment in attention. This is not the case with dementia , which develops gradually over months to years. Distinguishing characteristics of Delirium and Dementia Feature Delirium Dementia Onset Acute (hours to days) Insidious, progressive (months to years) Duration Short-term (hours to weeks) Long-term (months to years) Course Fluctuating, worse at night (sundowning) Steady, progressive deterioration Consciousness Impaired, fluctuating levels of alertness Clear until late stages Attention Markedly impaired Normal until later stages Memory Impairment (Option C ruled out) Short-term memory is severely impaired Short-term memory loss in the early stages, long-term memory affected later Hallucinations/Delusions Common, often visual or tactile Uncommon in early stages, it may occur in advanced stages (Option C ruled out) Sleep-Wake Cycle Disrupted (e.g., insomnia, daytime drowsiness, reversal of sleep cycle) Sleep disturbances occur late in the disease EEG Findings Abnormal, showing diffuse slowing Normal in early stages; slowing in late stages Acuity of onset and agitation (Option A) : While agitation can occur in delirium and dementia, the key distinguishing feature is the onset . Delirium involves a rapid onset of agitation, confusion, and fluctuating attention, whereas agitation in dementia is usually seen in later stages. Agitation and irritation (Option D) are also present in delirium and dementia; hence, they are not the primary distinguishing features.

      },
      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: A) Malingering Explanation: The boy's symptoms, which only occurred the day before his final exam, suggest malingering. He is likely faking his symptoms to avoid taking the exam. Malingering is the falsification or profound exaggeration of illness (physical or mental) to gain external benefits such as avoiding work or responsibility, seeking drugs, avoiding trial (law), seeking attention, avoiding military services, taking leave from school, and taking paid leave from a job, among others. It is not a psychiatric illness. Malingering is associated with an antisocial personality disorder and histrionic personality trait. Incorrect Options: Factitious disorder (Option B) : In this condition, a person deliberately causes or feigns symptoms to assume the sick role. Dissimilar to malingering, individuals with factitious turmoil have no outer inspiration for their way of behaving. They might do it for the consideration, the compassion, or the sensation of being really focused. Somatization syndrome (Option C) : Individuals with somatization syndrome experience various physical symptoms unrelated to any medical condition. In somatic symptom disorder (SSD), exaggerated anxiety about these symptoms leads to intense thoughts, feelings, and behaviours, often impairing daily activities. Hypochondriasis (Option D) : Illness anxiety disorder, also known as hypochondriasis or health anxiety, involves excessive worry about illness, often without physical symptoms. Individuals may interpret normal sensations or minor symptoms as signs of a severe illness, even when thorough medical evaluations reveal no serious condition. This anxiety, rather than the symptoms themselves, causes significant distress and disrupts daily life.

      "explanation": "basal nucleus of Meynert, is a group of neurons located in the basal forebrain that produces and releases the neurotransmitter acetylcholine. In Alzheimer's disease, there is a significant degeneration of the nucleus of Meynert, which contributes to the cholinergic dysfunction observed in the disease. The loss of cholinergic neurons and acetylcholine depletion is associated with cognitive impairments. Incorrect Options: Option A - Intracellular neurofibrillary tangles are seen: One of the pathological hallmarks of Alzheimer's disease is the presence of intracellular neurofibrillary tangles. These tangles are made up of abnormal tau protein that has accumulated inside neurons. Neurofibrillary tangles contribute to the disruption of neuronal function and eventual cell death. Option B - Neuritic plaques made of beta-amyloid are found: Neuritic plaques, also known as senile plaques, are another characteristic feature of Alzheimer's disease. These plaques consist of aggregates of beta-amyloid protein that accumulate between neurons in the brain. The presence of neuritic plaques is associated with inflammation and neuronal damage. Option D - Short-term memory is affected: Short-term memory impairment is a hallmark symptom of Alzheimer's disease. As the disease progresses, individuals may have difficulty retaining and recalling new information, experiencing deficits in short-term memory.
