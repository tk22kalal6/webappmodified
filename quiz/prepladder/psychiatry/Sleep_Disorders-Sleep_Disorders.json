Correct Answer: B) EEG shows low amplitude, mixed frequency waves; EOG shows rapid eye movements; EMG shows atonia (reduced muscle tone). Explanation: EEG in REM sleep shows low amplitude, mixed frequency waves, similar to an awake state. EOG shows rapid eye movements, characteristic of this sleep stage. EMG shows atonia, meaning there is a near-complete loss of muscle tone, preventing movement during vivid dreaming. REM sleep: EEG findings: EEG activity is increased similar to the awake state (beta activity) along with the return of alpha activity (Option A) The typical appearance of these waves which are known as Sawtooth waves or Sawtooth appearance. Paradoxical sleep: Even though the person is sleeping the EEG shows activity similar to the awake state.

      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "increased muscle tone. Correct Answer: B) REM sleep is associated with muscle atonia, whereas NREM sleep features increased muscle tone. Explanation: REM sleep is characterized by muscle atonia (nearly complete paralysis of skeletal muscles), except for the muscles responsible for eye movement and breathing. This atonia helps prevent the body from acting out dreams. NREM sleep, on the other hand, has increased muscle tone and does not involve vivid dreaming as seen in REM sleep. REM NREM Paradoxical sleep - asleep but the EEG is showing the activity of the active day. Brain activity and physiological activity area increased or same as in the awake state except for the muscle tone (the muscles are in the state of paralysis). Known as desynchronized sleep : Lots of variables in REM Body movements are absent. Penile erection is present. Dreams are remembered. Disorders: Narcolepsy Nightmares REM sleep behavior disorder Sleep apnea Known as orthodox or conventional sleep Brain activity & physiological activity are lower than in the awake state. Known as synchronized- minimal variations are there in parameters such as pulse rate, respiratory rate, and BP. Pulsatile release of Gonadotropins and Growth hormones. Body movements are present. Penile erection is absent. Dreams are not remembered. Disorders: Somnambulism (sleepwalking) Night terror Bruxism Nocturnal enuresis Somniloquy (sleep talking) Polysomnography: It is the continuous, attended, comprehensive recording of the physiologic changes that occur during sleep. A polysomnogram is typically recorded at night and lasts between 6 and 8 hours. The following are assessed during sleep: Brain wave activity (EEG) Eye movements (EOG) Submentalis electromyography activity (EMG) Nasal–oral airflow Nasal pressure Respiratory effort Oxyhemoglobin saturation Heart rhythm Leg movements Body position Snoring sounds REM sleep is associated with increased muscle tone, while NREM sleep features muscle atonia (Option A): This option incorrectly switches the characteristics of muscle tone in REM and NREM sleep. In REM sleep, there is muscle atonia (loss of muscle tone), whereas in NREM sleep, muscle tone is generally increased. REM sleep occurs only in the early hours of the night, while NREM sleep predominates throughout the night (Option C): REM sleep does not occur only in the early hours; it increases in duration as the night goes on, particularly in the latter part of sleep. NREM sleep does dominate the early part of the night but is interspersed with REM periods throughout the sleep cycles REM sleep is marked by delta waves, while NREM sleep is marked by alpha waves (Option D): NREM sleep (Non-Rapid Eye Movement sleep) consists of several",

      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: A) Cognitive Behavioral Therapy for Insomnia (CBT-I) Explanation: Cognitive Behavioral Therapy for Insomnia (CBT-I) is the first-line treatment for chronic insomnia. It addresses maladaptive thoughts and behaviors related to sleep and has long-term benefits with minimal side effects. Sleep restriction therapy and stimulus control are components of CBT-I, where patients gradually reduce their time in bed to increase sleep efficiency. Insomnia is characterized by dissatisfaction with the amount or quality of sleep, leading to significant distress or difficulties in social, occupational, or other important areas of functioning. Types of Insomnia: As per ICSD-3 (International Classification of Sleep Disorder) Acute or Short-term insomnia disorder: <3 months Chronic insomnia disorder: ≥ 3 months Previous guidelines classify insomnia into: Primary - without a specific cause Psychophysiologic Idiopathic Paradoxical Secondary- due to some other disorder DSM-5 classifies as: Episodic (lasting 1–3 mo) Persistent (lasting ≥ 3 mo) Recurrent (two or more episodes occurring within 1 y) Insomnia in general may present as: Difficulty falling asleep - Initial Insomnia Difficulty maintaining sleep - Middle Insomnia Early morning awakenings - Late Insomnia Management of Insomnia: 1. Cognitive Behavioral Therapy for Insomnia (CBT-I) CBT-I is the first-line treatment for chronic insomnia, conducted over a 6- to 8-week period. It is highly effective and focuses on changing behaviors and thoughts that affect sleep. It involves several components: Cognitive Therapy Relaxation or Meditation Therapy Sleep Education Sleep Restriction Therapy Stimulus Control Therapy 2. Medications for Insomnia Benzodiazepine Receptor Agonists - zolpidem, zaleplon, and eszopiclone Melatonin Receptor Agonists - Ramelteon Orexin Receptor Antagonists - Suvorexant Benzodiazepines Melatonin supplements (Option B): Melatonin is often used for circadian rhythm sleep disorders, such as delayed sleep phase syndrome, and may have some benefit in insomnia. However, it is not considered a first-line treatment for chronic insomnia. Benzodiazepines (Option C): While effective in inducing sleep, benzodiazepines are not first-line treatments for chronic insomnia due to their potential for tolerance, dependence, and withdrawal. They may be considered for short-term use in acute insomnia but should be avoided for long-term management. Antihistamines (Option D): While easily available, antihistamines are not effective long-term",

She describes an uncomfortable sensation in her legs, often accompanied by an irresistible urge to move them, particularly in the evening and at night. These symptoms subside temporarily after moving her legs but recur shortly after. She denies any history of substance use, and her medical history is unremarkable.

        "D": "Generalized Anxiety Disorder"
      },
      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: C) Restless Leg Syndrome Explanation: Restless Leg Syndrome (RLS) also known as Willis-Ekbom Disease is characterized by an uncomfortable sensation in the legs, especially in the evening or at night, which leads to an irresistible urge to move them. The movement temporarily relieves the discomfort, but the symptoms soon return, causing difficulty falling asleep or maintaining sleep. This leads to insomnia, which is a common complaint in patients with RLS. Features of RLS include: Sensations that begin after rest Relief of discomfort with movement Worsening of symptoms at night with a distinct symptom-free period in the early morning Treatment of Restless Legs Syndrome (RLS) No definite cure, but symptoms can be managed. Movement of affected limbs may provide temporary relief. Treat underlying conditions like peripheral neuropathy, diabetes, or iron deficiency anemia to control symptoms. Medications: Iron supplements : For RLS linked to iron deficiency. Anti-seizure drugs (first-line treatment): FDA-approved: Gabapentin enacarbil , others like pregabalin . Dopaminergic agents : FDA-approved: Ropinirole, pramipexole, rotigotine . Levodopa + carbidopa are used intermittently. Opioids : For severe cases unresponsive to other drugs (e.g., methadone, oxycodone ). Benzodiazepines : For better sleep ( clonazepam, lorazepam ). Lifestyle Modifications: Avoid alcohol, nicotine, and caffeine. Maintain a regular sleep pattern. Engage in moderate exercise. Use leg massage, warm baths, heating pads, or foot wraps for relief. Periodic Limb Movement Disorder (PLMD) (Option A) involves repetitive, involuntary jerking or movements of the limbs during sleep, which may cause brief arousals but does not necessarily involve the urge to move the legs as seen in RLS. While both PLMD and RLS can cause sleep disturbances, RLS symptoms occur primarily before sleep onset, while PLMD typically occurs during sleep. Obstructive Sleep Apnea (OSA) (Option B) is characterized by repetitive episodes of partial or complete obstruction of the airway during sleep, leading to fragmented sleep and daytime fatigue. While OSA can cause insomnia, the hallmark of OSA is loud snoring and witnessed apneas, neither of which is mentioned in this case. Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD) (Option D) can cause insomnia due to excessive worry and hyperarousal, but the physical symptoms of RLS, such as leg discomfort and the urge to move, are not characteristic of anxiety",

        "D": "Narcolepsy Type 2"
      },
      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: A) Narcolepsy Type 1 Explanation: Narcolepsy Type 1 is a REM disorder characterized by excessive daytime sleepiness, reduced REM latency, cataplexy (sudden loss of muscle tone triggered by emotions like laughter), hypnagogic or hypnopompic hallucinations (vivid hallucinations occurring while falling asleep or waking up), and sleep paralysis (temporary inability to move upon awakening). These are classic symptoms described in this scenario. Types of Narcolepsy: As per ICSD 3: Type 1: Excessive sleepiness Cataplexy with or without hypocretin 1 deficiency Mean sleep latency of ≤ 8 min and two sleep-onset rapid eye movement periods (SOREMP) within 15 min of sleep onset. Type 2: Cataplexy and/or hypocretin deficiency not present Other features of type 1 are present. According to DSM 5: Narcolepsy without cataplexy but with hypocretin deficiency Narcolepsy with cataplexy but without hypocretin deficiency Autosomal dominant cerebellar ataxia, deafness, and narcolepsy (due to genetic mutation and characterized by late onset in the 30s and 40s) Autosomal dominant narcolepsy, obesity, and type 2 diabetes (associated with mutation in myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein gene) Narcolepsy secondary to another medical condition Severity of Narcolepsy as per DSM 5: Mild : <1/week, 1–2 naps daily mildly, or intermittently disturbed sleep. Moderate : cataplexy 1/day. Disturbed sleep, need for multiple naps. Severe : near constant. Multiple attacks/day. Disturbed sleep. Resistant to medications. Treatment of Narcolepsy: Behavior Modification: Scheduled naps (15-20 minutes) throughout the day. Maintain a proper nighttime sleep schedule. Emotional support, mental health counselling, and education on avoiding alcohol/illicit drugs. Exercise is also recommended. Pharmacological Treatment: For Excessive Daytime Sleepiness: First-line: Modafinil (twice daily) or Armodafinil (once daily). Second-line: Amphetamines . For Cataplexy: First-line: Sodium Oxybate (taken in bed, second dose after 2.5-4 hours). Sodium oxybate is restricted and should not be mixed with CNS depressants or alcohol. Alternatives: Tricyclic antidepressants (protriptyline, clomipramine), SNRIs/SSRIs (venlafaxine, fluoxetine). Obstructive Sleep Apnea (Option B) presents with daytime sleepiness due to disrupted nighttime sleep but does not feature cataplexy, hypnagogic hallucinations, or sleep paralysis. It is caused by intermittent airway obstruction during sleep. Idiopathic Hypersomnia (Option C)",

        "D": "Fluoxetine"
      },
      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: A) Modafinil Explanation: Modafinil is a first-line treatment for excessive daytime sleepiness in narcolepsy. It promotes wakefulness with a lower potential for abuse compared to traditional stimulants like amphetamines. It is well-tolerated and improves the patient's quality of life by reducing daytime sleepiness. The management of narcolepsy involves a combination of behavioral modifications and pharmacological interventions to address both excessive daytime sleepiness and cataplexy. 1. Behavioral Modification: Patients are encouraged to take 15 to 20-minute naps at strategic times during the day and to maintain good sleep hygiene at night. These naps help to alleviate excessive daytime sleepiness. Exercise is also recommended. 2. Pharmacological Treatment: For Excessive Daytime Sleepiness (EDS): The first-line treatment is Modafinil (administered twice daily) or Armodafinil (once daily), both of which promote wakefulness. In cases where these are ineffective, amphetamines may be used as second-line treatment. For Cataplexy: The first-line treatment for cataplexy is Sodium Oxybate , which induces sleep quickly and is administered in two doses—once while in bed and again 2.5 to 4 hours later. Tricyclic antidepressants (e.g., protriptyline, clomipramine) and SSRIs/SNRIs (e.g., venlafaxine, fluoxetine) are also used effectively for cataplexy management. Clonazepam (Option B) is primarily used to treat parasomnias such as REM sleep behavior disorder, but it is not effective for managing daytime sleepiness or cataplexy in narcolepsy. Zolpidem (Option C) is a sedative-hypnotic used for the short-term management of insomnia. It would not address excessive daytime sleepiness or cataplexy in narcolepsy patients. Fluoxetine (Option D) is a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) that can be used to treat cataplexy by reducing the frequency of episodes, but it is not the initial treatment for excessive daytime sleepiness. It may be considered an adjunct therapy for cataplexy management. Reference: Narcolepsy",

The hallmark of the syndrome is the cyclical pattern of symptoms with complete recovery between episodes . Kleine-Levin Syndrome (KLS): Periods of excessive sleep (18-20 hours/day) lasting for days to weeks, followed by normal functioning. ( Recurrent Hypersomnia ) Typically affects adolescent males, though females and older adults can also be affected. Most cases begin between ages 10 and 21. Symptoms During Episodes : Extreme and prolonged sleep Hyperphagia (excessive eating), hypersexuality, irritability, social withdrawal, and disinhibition (e.g., aggression). Episodes may occur 1 to 10 times per year. Some patients exhibit only hypersomnia without other behavioral symptoms. The condition is usually sporadic, though familial cases have been reported Narcolepsy (Option A) is characterized by excessive daytime sleepiness, sleep attacks, and often cataplexy, hypnagogic hallucinations, and sleep paralysis. It does not involve prolonged episodes of hypersomnia, hyperphagia, or hypersexuality. Narcolepsy is more continuous, rather than episodic like Kleine-Levin Syndrome. Major Depressive Disorder with Atypical Features (Option C) may involve hypersomnia and hyperphagia, but it lacks the episodic nature and additional symptoms of hypersexuality and irritability seen in Kleine-Levin Syndrome. Patients with atypical depression typically experience mood reactivity, feelings of heaviness in limbs, and sensitivity to rejection, which are absent in KLS. Bipolar Disorder - Manic Episode (Option D) may present with hypersexuality and irritability, but it is typically associated with a reduced need for sleep rather than hypersomnia. Additionally, mania includes symptoms like grandiosity, pressured speech, and increased goal-directed activity, which are not features of Kleine-Levin Syndrome.

Typically occurs during slow-wave sleep, starting in the first or second slow-wave episodes. Can be triggered by sleep deprivation and disruption of slow-wave sleep.. Difficult to awaken; they often appear confused when roused. More common in children , with a peak prevalence between ages 4 and 8, and usually resolves by adolescence. Can occur as a primary disorder or secondary to another sleep issue, like sleep apnea. Night Terrors Night terrors involve sudden arousal with intense fear, often starting with a scream. Accompanied by signs of severe anxiety and confusion; individuals are unresponsive to stimuli. Typically occurs during slow-wave sleep and may be triggered by fever or CNS depressant withdrawal. Amnesia for the episode is common. Unlike nightmares, sleep terrors may lack detailed imagery. Confusional Arousals Defined as a milder form of NREM sleep parasomnia, often seen in children. Involves partial awakening, confusion, and then returning to sleep. Believed to be on a continuum with sleepwalking and sleep terrors. Sleep-Related Eating Disorder Classified under NREM sleep arousal disorders, specifically as “sleepwalking with sleep-related eating.” Involves episodes of eating during sleep, often with no awareness of the behavior. Can lead to weight gain and health issues, including injuries while preparing food. Sleep Talking (Somniloquy) Speaking during sleep without awareness is often incoherent or nonsensical. Occurs during stages N1 and N2, but can also happen in REM. Can vary from rare occurrences to frequent episodes, lasting for a few seconds or minutes. Can occur independently or alongside other parasomnias like sleepwalking or night terrors. Stress, sleep deprivation, alcohol, or fever may trigger episodes.

      "explanation": "Correct Answer: B) REM Sleep Behavior Disorder Explanation: REM Sleep Behavior Disorder (RBD) is characterized by acting out dreams due to the absence of muscle paralysis during REM sleep, matching the patient’s symptoms of kicking, punching, and shouting. REM related Parasomnias Nightmare Disorder (Option A ruled out) Nightmares are frightening dreams that wake the person sleeping. They are often remembered. Common in children (ages 3-6) but rare in adults. Can lead to insomnia due to fear of sleeping. Associated with PTSD and traumatic events. Certain medications and substance abuse can trigger nightmares. Treatment: Behavioral techniques like desensitization, exposure therapy, image rehearsal therapy, and cognitive therapy can be effective. Medications such as prazosin, nitrazepam, and triazolam may also help, especially for PTSD-related nightmares. REM Sleep Behavior Disorder (RBD) RBD involves acting out dreams due to lack of sleep paralysis. Individuals may punch or kick while dreaming. They are unaware of their surroundings during episodes. Actions relate directly to dream content. There is a risk of injury to themselves or others. Various drugs and conditions can worsen RBD. On polysomnography, REM sleep without atonia may be seen. May be associated with DLB, Parkinson's disease. Recurrent Isolated Sleep Paralysis (Option C ruled out) Sleep paralysis is the inability to move during sleep onset or awakening. It can be distressing and may include hallucinations. It can occur independently of narcolepsy. Paralysis can last from one to several minutes. Risk factors include irregular sleep, stress, and sleep deprivation. Treatment: Improved sleep hygiene and ensuring sufficient sleep are primary treatments. Rapid eye movements or being touched may help terminate episodes. Sleep Terrors (Option D) : These typically occur during non-REM sleep, involve screaming or intense fear, and are usually not remembered by the individual upon waking.
