      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer B - Adjustment disorder The given symptoms align better with Adjustment disorder, which occurs in response to a specific stressor like losing a job in the given condition and is characterised by symptoms such as irritability, sadness, and worry. Adjustment disorder Definition Excessively distressing emotional or behavioral symptoms that occur in response to a stressor Stressors are mild to moderate, such as financial, medical, or relationship issues Symptoms Low mood and tearfulness Anxiety Aggression Symptoms lead to impairment and poor functioning Occur within 3 months of the stressor and usually resolve within 6 months of the resolution of the stressor Common in hospitalised patients Treatment Psychotherapy: Group therapy, Cognitive Behavioural Therapy (CBT) Crisis intervention Pharmacotherapy with SSRIs and anxiolytics is not typically employed. Generalised anxiety disorder (Option A) involves excessive, uncontrollable worry about a range of topics, not just a specific stressor, but the patient's symptoms are more focused on the recent job loss, which explains Adjustment disorder. Mixed anxiety with depression (Option C) refers to the simultaneous presence of both anxiety and depression symptoms. Although this patient may show some overlapping signs, the primary diagnosis here is adjustment disorder, as the symptoms follow the recent stressor, which is the loss of a job. Moderate depression (Option D) would typically involve more persistent and pervasive symptoms such as anhedonia or severe functional impairment, not just reactions to a stressor with temporary relief. Hence, it is not the correct answer. Reference: Kaplan and Saddock’s Synopsis of Psychiatry, 12th Edition, Pages 1371, 1372",

      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: A) It most commonly affects ages 35-45 years Explanation: Bipolar disorder is a type of mood disorder characterized by episodes of depression, mania, hypomania, and mixed episodes. It typically begins in the late teens to early 20s, with an average age of onset around 18-24 years. While it can occur in children or later in life, it is less common for it to primarily affect individuals aged 35-45 years. Even a single episode of mania is considered a bipolar disorder. ICD-11 classifies two types of bipolar disorder. Bipolar disorder Types Bipolar I Disorder Bipolar II Disorder Characterized by at least 1 episode of mania and 1 episode of depression Characterized by at least 1 episode of hypomania and 1 episode of depression M = F (Option B ruled out) F > M Age of onset is between 12 - 24 years Age of onset is slightly higher Epidemiology Annual incidence is less than 1% . Depressive episodes are more common in women . Women are more prone to mixed episodes and rapid cycling . The prevalence rate (in the general population) of bipolar I disorder is 0 - 2.4%, and the prevalence of bipolar II disorder is 0.3 - 4.8%. (Option C ruled out) Age of Onset: Onset ranges from 5 to 50 years, with a mean age of 30 . Prevalence in adolescents rises from 2% at ages 13-14 to 4% by age 18 . Socioeconomic Factors: Higher incidence in divorced or single individuals. More common in upper socioeconomic groups and non-college graduates. Suicide attempts are common in bipolar disorder, with about 15% of individuals attempting suicide at some point in their lives. (Option D ruled out) Genetics Family history increases the risk for mood disorders. 1st-degree relatives have a 10-fold risk of developing bipolar disorder. Genetic overlap with schizophrenia , especially on chromosomes 18q and 22q. Brain Imaging Increased hyperintensities in subcortical areas (basal ganglia, thalamus) in bipolar I disorder . Imaging studies show increased dopamine transporter levels. Functional imaging shows abnormal brain activation, with hyperactivity in frontal areas and hypoactivity in the amygdala and basal ganglia .

      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer C - Depression with dysthymia Double depression refers to the coexistence of dysthymia (persistent depressive disorder) and episodes of major depressive disorder (MDD). Individuals experience a chronic baseline depressive state (dysthymia) with intermittent periods of more severe depression (MDD). Features: Persistent low mood lasting at least 2 years (dysthymia). Superimposed episodes of major depressive symptoms. Increased risk of disability and difficulty in treatment, as the chronic dysthymic state often persists even after resolving the major depressive episodes. Major depressive disorder from 2 years (Option A) : Although major depressive disorder can have a chronic course, the term \"double depression\" specifically refers to the coexistence of MDD and dysthymia, not chronic MDD alone. Major depression with OCD (Option B): Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder (OCD) is characterised by intrusive thoughts (obsessions) and repetitive behaviours (compulsions). While depressive symptoms may coexist with OCD, \"double depression\" specifically refers to the combination of major depressive disorder and dysthymia, not OCD. Depression with anxiety attack (Option D) . While anxiety symptoms can often co-occur with depressive symptoms, the term \"double depression\" is not used to describe this combination.

      "explanation": "Correct Answer A - Cognitive behavioural therapy For a patient with mild depression, the first-line treatment typically involves psychotherapy, with Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) being the most commonly recommended approach. Treatment Approaches for Depression Type of Therapy Description Indication Combination Therapy Pharmacotherapy + Psychotherapy Combines medications (e.g., antidepressants) with psychotherapy for a higher response rate. Moderate to severe depression Single Therapy Psychotherapy alone may be sufficient for mild cases. Mild depression Psychotherapy Types Somatic Treatments Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) Interpersonal Therapy (IPT) Family Therapy Psychoanalytically Oriented Therapy Behavior Therapy Electroconvulsive Therapy (ECT) Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (TMS) Vagal Nerve Stimulation (VNS) Deep Brain Stimulation (DBS) Phototherapy Sleep Deprivation Cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) and antidepressants (Option B) : For mild depression, CBT alone is typically sufficient. In cases of moderate to severe depression, a combination of CBT and antidepressant medications is recommended for effective treatment. Mild antidepressants (Option C) are usually indicated in chronic moderate to severe depression, and not mild depression Vagus nerve stimulation (Option D) is not indicated for mild depression. It involves stimulating the left vagus nerve using electrodes connected to a pulse generator implanted in the chest. This procedure is primarily used for treatment-resistant depression.

        "D": "Propranolol"
      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer B - Lorazepam The patient exhibits symptoms of catatonia, including voluntary aimless motions, prolonged immobility, waxy flexibility, and negativism. Catatonia is a psychomotor syndrome often associated with psychiatric conditions like schizophrenia or mood disorders. Lorazepam , a benzodiazepine, is the first-line treatment for catatonia. Catatonia Definition It is a psychomotor syndrome characterised by a range of motor, behavioural, and verbal disturbances. It can occur in various psychiatric, medical, and neurological conditions and may present with excessive motor activity or markedly reduced motor activity . Features Stupor Catalepsy Waxy flexibility Mutism Negativism Posturing : Spontaneous maintenance of a rigid or bizarre posture. Stereotypies: Repetitive, non-goal-directed movements (e.g., hand flapping or grimacing). Mannerisms: repetitive, odd, purposeful movements. Agitation Echolalia or Echopraxia: Repetition of another's words (echolalia) or movements (echopraxia) Treatment First-line treatment involves benzodiazepines (e.g., lorazepam), which are effective in alleviating catatonic symptoms. Electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) is also highly effective and often used in patients who do not respond to pharmacotherapy or when rapid resolution is required. Haloperidol (Option A) is an antipsychotic medication that is used for psychosis, and it may be used in the management of psychotic features of catatonia as well. However, it is not the first-line treatment for catatonia, sometimes use of antipsychotics alone can worsen the catatonic symptoms. Clonidine (Option C) is an alpha-2 adrenergic agonist that is used for managing hypertension and ADHD. It has no role in managing catatonia. Propranolol (Option D) is a beta-blocker that is used for managing hypertension , anxiety , and essential tremors . It does not treat catatonia and has no effect on the underlying motor symptoms or psychotic features associated with this condition.

        "A": "Depression",
        "B": "Bipolar disorder - manic episode",
        "C": "Schizophrenia",
        "D": "Substance- induced mood disorder"
      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "hyperactivity , strongly suggest a manic episode . Manic episodes are characterized by elevated or irritable mood, increased energy, impulsivity, distractibility, and decreased need for sleep , typically lasting at least one week . The fact that these symptoms worsened after discontinuing prescribed medication further supports the diagnosis, as stopping mood stabilizers or antipsychotics can trigger a manic relapse. Bipolar disorder Bipolar disorder is a type of mood disorder characterized by episodes of depression, mania, hypomania, mixed episodes. Even a single episode of mania is considered bipolar disorder. ICD-11 classifies only two types of bipolar disorder. Bipolar I Disorder Bipolar II Disorder Characterized by at least 1 episode of mania and 1 episode of depression Characterized by at least 1 episode of hypomania and 1 episode of depression (Option B) M=F F>M Mean age of onset is 30yrs Mean age of onset is slightly higher Diagnostic criteria for Mania M ood Changes: Elation/ irritability + ≥ 3 of the following symptoms (4 if irritable mood) for at least 1 week : D istractibility. I mpulsivity/ high-risk activities G randiosity/ Inflated Self-Esteem F light of Ideas (Racing and expansive thoughts) A ctivity increased (Hyperactivity) S leep deficit (decreased need for sleep) T alkativeness/ Pressured speech Mania with Psychotic Symptoms: May include delusions or hallucinations . Can be mood-congruent or mood-incongruent. Mood-congruent: When psychotic symptoms are mood-congruent, the content of a person’s delusions or hallucinations aligns with the person’s mood state. Mood-incongruent: The content of a person’s delusions or hallucinations does not match their mood. Other Options: Depression (Option A): This condition typically presents with low mood, fatigue, decreased energy, and sleep disturbances , but not hyperactivity, aggression, or rapid speech . The patient’s symptoms are more suggestive of mania rather than a depressive episode. Schizophrenia (Option C): While schizophrenia can involve disorganized speech and behavior , it is primarily characterized by delusions, hallucinations, and cognitive impairment , which are not mentioned in this case. The episodic nature of the patient’s symptoms also favors bipolar disorder over schizophrenia. Substance-Induced Mood Disorder (Option D): While certain drugs (e.g., stimulants) can cause hyperactivity and aggression , there is no mention of substance use, withdrawal, or intoxication in the case history, making this diagnosis less likely.

Symptoms of sexual dysfunction include: Decreased libido (sexual desire) Erectile dysfunction Delayed ejaculation - therefore, these can be used for the treatment of premature ejaculation. Anorgasmia (inability to achieve orgasm) Other Side effects of SSRIs include: Nausea, vomiting (Most common) Diarrhoea (Option A ruled out) Insomnia Anxiety during the initial weeks of treatment Sexual dysfunction Increased risk of suicide soon after starting drug Bleeding (thrombocytopenia) Loss of weight (Option D ruled out) Sialorrhea (Option C) is defined as excessive salivation, and it is not generally associated with SSRIs.

      "explanation": "Correct Answer: C) Childhood anxiety disorder Explanation: The diagnosis for a child who exhibits selective mutism is a childhood anxiety disorder . It is characterised by consistently failing to speak in certain social situations (like in schools) despite being able to speak in other situations (like at home). Age of onset: 4 - 8 years Treatment: A comprehensive approach involving psychoeducation for the family, CBT, and SSRIs as required. Cognitive Behavioural Therapy (CBT) is the first line of management in school-going children. Incorrect Options: Childhood depression (Option A) usually involves pervasive sadness, loss of interest, fatigue, and irritability, but mutism is not a characteristic of depression alone. Childhood psychosis (Option B) refers to conditions where a child loses touch with reality, often presenting with hallucinations and delusions . Children with selective mutism are typically not psychotic ; they can perceive reality and understand social norms but simply experience extreme anxiety in specific situations, preventing them from speaking. Hyperkinetic disorder (Option D) is also called as ADHD, and it involves symptoms like inattention , impulsivity , and hyperactivity , which lead to difficulty maintaining focus and control over behaviour, particularly in settings like school. Children with ADHD generally do not refuse to speak in specific settings. Instead, their struggles are related to attention and activity regulation .

      },
      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer A - Major depressive disorder with psychotic features Major depressive disorder with psychotic features is the most appropriate diagnosis as the patient meets the criteria for MDD (depressed mood, loss of interest, weight loss, insomnia for 6 months ) along with psychotic features, specifically auditory hallucinations. Psychotic features in MDD are typically mood-congruent (consistent with emotional state) and are linked to the depressive state. Psychotic depression Definition Major depression disorder (MDD) with psychotic features includes mood disturbance with delusions, hallucinations, or both. Prevalence It occurs in approximately 18.5% of MDD patients and increases with age. Characteristics Higher treatment resistance More suicide attempts Longer illness duration Greater functional impairment Higher relapse rates Older patients may exhibit more brain atrophy and higher mortality rates compared to non-psychotic patients. Geriatric Considerations Patients often show significant cognitive dysfunction; depressive pseudodementia may develop. Cognitive Impairment Combination therapy : antidepressants + antipsychotics or ECT is the standard of care. Treatment Approaches Monotherapy with SSRIs or TCAs is less effective . Efficacy of ECT ECT shows high remission rates (up to 95% in psychotic depression) compared to pharmacotherapy. ECT is first-line treatment in case of severe psychotic symptoms and high suicide risk. Schizophrenia (Option B) is a chronic disorder marked by delusions, hallucinations, disorganised thinking, and negative symptoms . This patient lacks the persistent psychotic features typical of schizophrenia, such as long-term delusions or disorganized behaviour. The auditory hallucination here is part of a depressive episode , not a separate psychotic disorder, making schizophrenia an inappropriate diagnosis. Schizoaffective disorder (Option C) involves psychotic symptoms occurring alongside a mood disorder , but for a diagnosis of schizoaffective disorder, the psychotic symptoms must persist for two weeks or more in the absence of mood symptoms . Delusional disorder (Option D) is characterised by delusions (fixed, false beliefs) lasting for at least a month, with no other psychotic symptoms.

His delusions and guilt (feeling that he deserves punishment) are classic features of depression with psychosis. Patients with Major Depressive Disorder with psychotic features experience psychotic symptoms only during mood episodes. Psychotic depression Definition Major depression disorder (MDD) with psychotic features includes mood disturbance with delusions, hallucinations, or both.

      "explanation": "Correct Answer: D) Support and Education Explanation: Postpartum blues , also known as baby blues , is a common and temporary mood disturbance that typically occurs in the first few days following childbirth, the condition is usually self-limiting , resolving on its own within a couple of weeks. Hence, support and education are the first-line interventions for postpartum blues. Postpartum Blues Postpartum Depression Postpartum Psychosis Occurrence It affects up to 80% of women after childbirth It affects 10 - 15% of women 70% risk of recurrence in the next pregnancy Incidence is about 1-2 in 1000 deliveries 50% risk of recurrence in the next pregnancy Timing Onset 3-5 days postpartum, resolves by days to weeks Within the first 6 weeks postpartum or after abortion Symptoms appear within 2-3 weeks postpartum and last 2-3 months. Symptoms Transient symptoms such as Emotionally labile Insomnia Weepiness Loss of energy Depressed mood Loss of interest or pleasure (anhedonia) Loss of appetite Insomnia Social withdrawal Irritability Suicidal thoughts Initial symptoms: insomnia, tearfulness, mood lability, fatigue, followed by Hallucinations Delusions Treatment Supportive treatment and reassurance Antidepressants and psychotherapy Hospitalization, pharmacological treatment (lithium, antipsychotics, antidepressants), long-term psychiatric care Temporary separation from the infant and nursing supervision may be necessary Fluoxetine (Option A) is an SSRI and is commonly used for major depressive disorder and anxiety disorders . While it may be used for postpartum depression, it is not recommended for postpartum blues, as these symptoms are mild and transient . Cognitive behavioural therapy (Option B) is not necessary for postpartum blues, which is generally mild and self-limiting. However, if postpartum blues evolve into postpartum depression , CBT might become part of the treatment strategy. Lithium carbonate (Option C) is a mood stabiliser that is used for bipolar disorder; it is not the first-line treatment for postpartum blues as they are generally mild and self-limiting, it may be used in severe postpartum depression with psychotic features.

      "correct_answer": "D",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: D) Generalized anxiety disorder Explanation: Generalized Anxiety Disorder is characterized by excessive, persistent, and uncontrollable worry about various aspects of daily life, such as health, finances, and personal relationships, lasting for six months or longer. The individual finds it difficult to control this worry, which significantly interferes with daily functioning. I n this case, the patient has experienced symptoms for two years, including restlessness, fatigue, disturbed sleep, and intrusive thoughts (such as fear of family accidents). These symptoms align with GAD, which often coexists with other mood or anxiety disorders. Treatment for GAD includes: Psychotherapy: Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) is particularly effective. Medication: Antidepressants (e.g., SSRIs) and anxiolytics may be used to manage symptoms. Early diagnosis and treatment can significantly improve the patient’s quality of life. Incorrect Options: Depression (Option A) is a mental illness that makes people feel worthless, hopeless, and sad all the time. Additionally, it may alter sleep patterns, appetite, energy levels, and concentration. The man in the situation refers to no side effects of gloom, like pity, sadness, or uselessness. Illness anxiety disorder (Option B) is a sort of uneasiness problem where individuals have a steady feeling of dread toward fostering a difficult sickness. Even when there is no sign of illness, they may still be concerned about their health. The man in the scenario doesn't talk about any of the symptoms of anxiety disorder, like the constant fear of getting a serious illness. Somatoform disorder (Option C) is a mental condition in which people suffer from physical symptoms brought on by psychological factors like stress or anxiety. These side effects can be genuine and incapacitating, yet an actual disease does not bring them about. The man in the scenario doesn't mention any signs of somatoform disorder, like physical signs that are caused by mental factors.

        "D": "GABA and norepinephrine"
      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: B) Serotonin and norepinephrine Explanation: Depression is primarily associated with dysregulation in the monoamine neurotransmitter systems , particularly: Serotonin (5-HT) : Plays a critical role in mood regulation, sleep, appetite, and emotional well-being. Deficiency is linked to feelings of sadness, hopelessness, and increased sensitivity to stress. Norepinephrine (NE) : Influences attention, arousal, and energy levels. Reduced norepinephrine activity contributes to fatigue, lack of motivation, and cognitive dysfunction. Incorrect Options: GABA and dopamine (Option A) : GABA (gamma-aminobutyric acid) is an inhibitory neurotransmitter that helps regulate neuronal excitability in the brain. Dopamine is a neurotransmitter involved in reward, motivation, and pleasure. While imbalances in GABA and dopamine levels have been implicated in certain mental health conditions, such as anxiety disorders and schizophrenia, they are not considered the primary neurotransmitters involved in depression. However, dopamine dysregulation may play a role in specific subtypes of depression, such as atypical depression. Dopamine and serotonin (Option C) . While both dopamine and serotonin are involved in mood regulation, dopamine is not considered one of the primary neurotransmitters involved in depression. Dopamine dysregulation is more closely associated with conditions like schizophrenia, substance abuse disorders, and certain mood disorders. GABA and norepinephrine (Option D) . Similar to the first option, GABA and norepinephrine are not considered the primary neurotransmitters involved in depression. While norepinephrine plays a role in mood regulation and stress response, GABA dysregulation is more commonly associated with anxiety disorders and epilepsy rather than depression.

Thus, it is not a component of Beck's theory. Psychosocial Theories of Depression: Cognitive Theory Depression arises from cognitive distortions known as depressogenic schemata. Cognitive Triad (by Aaron Beck) : Worthlessness: Negative self-perception. Helplessness: Perception of the environment as hostile and demanding. Hopelessness: Expectation of suffering and failure in the future. Therapy focuses on modifying these cognitive distortions. Life Events and Environmental Stress Stressful life events often precede the first episode of mood disorders. Initial stress may lead to long-lasting biological changes, increasing the risk for future episodes even without further stressors. Psychodynamic Theories Early disturbances in the infant-mother relationship predispose to depression. Depression is linked to real or imagined loss of significant objects. Introjection of lost objects serves as a defense mechanism. Feelings of love and hate toward the lost object result in self-directed anger. Learned Helplessness Developed from studies showing that exposure to uncontrollable stressors (e.g., electric shocks in dogs) leads to passive behaviour. Humans may internalize helplessness and lose self-esteem after adverse events. Improvement in depression involves learning a sense of control and mastery over one’s environment. Evolutionary Theory Depression is viewed as an adaptive response to perceived environmental threats. Withdrawal from social situations and decreased activity may serve as protective mechanisms.

Nephrogenic diabetes insipidus (DI) Fine tremors (most common adverse effect) ECG changes: T-wave flattening Leukocytosis Loose stools (diarrhea) It is not absorbed from the gut (Option B): This statement is incorrect. Lithium is readily absorbed in the gastrointestinal tract after oral administration. It is not teratogenic (Option C): Lithium is a medication commonly used for the treatment of bipolar disorder. However, it is known to be teratogenic, meaning it can cause harm to a developing fetus if taken during pregnancy. Lithium exposure during the first trimester has been associated with an increased risk of cardiac malformations, particularly Ebstein's anomaly, in the fetus Approved for absence seizure (Option D): This statement is incorrect. Lithium is not commonly used for the treatment of absent seizures (also known as absence seizures). It is primarily indicated for bipolar disorder and certain other psychiatric conditions.

Migraine Prophylaxis: Valproate is considered a second-line treatment for preventing migraines. Mixed Seizure Syndromes: It is used in conditions such as Lennox-Gastaut syndrome. Severe Myoclonic Epilepsy of Infancy: Valproate is also used in Dravet syndrome Adverse effects Gastrointestinal: Nausea, vomiting, and indigestion. Neurological: Tremor, sedation, dizziness, and ataxia. Hepatic: Hepatotoxicity (mainly in children <2 years of age). Hematologic: Thrombocytopenia and other blood dyscrasias. Metabolic: Weight gain, hyperammonemia, and pancreatitis. Teratogenicity: Risk of congenital malformations, such as neural tube defects (spina bifida oculta) , if used during pregnancy. Others: Hair loss (alopecia) and polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS). Valproate is a CYP enzyme inhibitor that inhibits CYP2C9, which can lead to increased levels of drugs metabolised by this enzyme, such as phenytoin and warfarin. Option A - Lithium can cause adverse effects like tremors, alopecia, acne, weight gain, seizures and sinus node dysfunction, hypothyroidism, ataxia, tinnitus, diarrhea, seizures, nephrogenic diabetes insipidus (DI), and Ebstein’s anomaly (cardiovascular defect called tricuspid atresia , which has a teratogenic effect when administered to pregnant women). It is not typically linked to hyperammonemia or hepatitis. Option C - Carbamazepine can cause hepatotoxicity but does not cause hyperammonemia. It has adverse effects like hepatotoxicity, neurotoxicity (Sedation, dizziness, vertigo, diplopia, and ataxia), coma, convulsions, cardiovascular collapse, water retention and hyponatremia, Steven Jones syndrome, agranulocytosis, aplastic anaemia, thrombocytopenia, hypersensitivity reactions and teratogenicity. Option D - Topiramate causes impairment of attention, sedation, ataxia, word-finding difficulties, poor memory, weight loss, paresthesias, and renal stones. It does not cause hepatotoxicity or hyperammonemia.

      "explanation": "Correct Answer: B) Panic disorder Explanation: The scenario, featuring anxiety, palpitations, sweating, breathlessness, chest pain, and a sense of impending doom, with 5-6 similar episodes over the last six months lasting 20-30 minutes each, is diagnosed as Panic Disorder . It is the recurrent, acute, intense attack of anxiety accompanied by a feeling of impending doom. It is more common in females than males. Median age of onset: Late adolescence or early adulthood. Highest familial risk for early-onset panic disorder Neurotransmitters involved: Norepinephrine, Serotonin, GABA, and Cholecystokinin. Clinical manifestations: Symptoms are random and unpredictable. The patient is free from anxiety symptoms in between attacks. Anticipatory anxiety: Fearing further attacks. Recurrent attacks of severe anxiety or panic. Unpredictable Physiologic symptoms. Avoidance behaviours: Avoiding real or imagined triggers to prevent another attack. Panic attacks: Unexpected, i.e., not restricted to any particular situation. Usually last for 20 to 30 minutes, rarely they may last more than one hour. Panic attacks for more than a month are termed as a Panic disorder. Cardiopulmonary: Feeling short of breath, palpitations, chest discomfort. Gastrointestinal: Nausea, GI discomfort Skin and systemic: Sweating, chills, feeling flushed. Neurologic: Tremors, dizziness, numbness and tingling sensation. Psychiatric: Derealization, depersonalization, fear of losing control, fear of dying. Treatment: Pharmacological, Psychological, and Combined treatments. Pharmacotherapy: Drug of choice : Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors. Other first-line: Serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor (SNRI) - Venlafaxine. Second-line: Tricyclic antidepressants, MAOIs, Other Psychotropics - Agomelatine, Buspirone, Mirtazapine. Benzodiazepines: Short-term use as an adjunct to SSRIs. Acute phase : Benzodiazepines such as Lorazepam & Clonazepam . Psychosocial therapies: Cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) Interpersonal therapy. Treatment of choice: SSRIs + Psychotherapy (CBT) Incorrect Options: Depression (Option A) is characterised by persistent feelings of sadness, hopelessness, and a lack of interest or pleasure in activities. The patient does not show the symptoms associated with depression. Generalized anxiety disorder (Option C) involves excessive, uncontrollable and unrealistic worry about various domains of life (e.g., work, health, family) occurring more days than not for at least 6 months. This patient's symptoms are not consistent with generalized anxiety disorder as they occur in distinct episodes. Phobia (Option D) refers to an excessive and irrational fear reaction of a person, object, animal, activity, or situation. If the patient had a phobia, we would expect her symptoms to be triggered by a specific object or situation, but that's not the case here.

      "correct_answer": "D",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer D - Fluoxetine Fluoxetine is a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI). SSRIs are recommended as a first-line treatment for major depressive disorder due to their efficacy in alleviating depressive symptoms. It works by increasing the availability of serotonin in the brain, which can help improve mood, appetite, and sleep patterns. Buspirone (Option A) is an anxiolytic primarily used for generalised anxiety disorder (GAD) . It lacks significant antidepressant efficacy. Lithium (Option B) Primarily used as a mood stabiliser for bipolar disorder and to augment antidepressants in treatment-resistant depression. It is not a first-line treatment for unipolar MDD. Divalproex (Option D) is a mood stabiliser used in bipolar disorder and epilepsy. Not effective as a primary treatment for MDD.

        "D": "Fluoxetine"
      },
      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer A - Bupropion Bupropion is least likely to cause sexual dysfunction compared to other antidepressants. As a dopamine-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor (DNRI) , it increases dopamine and norepinephrine levels without affecting serotonin, unlike SSRIs and SNRIs, which often cause sexual dysfunction by raising serotonin levels. Bupropion may even improve sexual function in some cases. Escitalopram (Option B) is a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) that works by increasing serotonin levels in the brain, which can improve mood but can also cause sexual dysfunction as a side effect. In some studies, up to 60% of patients taking SSRIs reported sexual dysfunction as a side effect. Venlafaxine (Option C) is a serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor (SNRI) that works by increasing the levels of both serotonin and norepinephrine in the brain, which can improve mood but can also cause sexual dysfunction as a side effect. Studies have shown that up to 30% of patients taking SNRIs reported sexual dysfunction as a side effect. Fluoxetine (Option D) is an SSRI antidepressant commonly prescribed for depression and anxiety disorders. While it can cause sexual dysfunction, it is less likely than SSRIs like paroxetine or sertraline. Its long half-life may prolong its effects on sexual function, making it less suitable for patients concerned about this side effect.

The symptoms of Addison's disease can include fatigue, loss of appetite, weight loss, low mood, and a lack of interest or pleasure in activities, which can overlap with depressive symptoms. Incorrect Options: Option B - Generalized anxiety disorder: Generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) is a mental health condition characterized by excessive and persistent worry or anxiety about various aspects of life. While there may be some overlap in symptoms such as fatigue, difficulty concentrating, and irritability between Addison's disease and GAD, the core features and causes of the two conditions are distinct. Addison's disease primarily results from adrenal gland dysfunction, while GAD is a psychological disorder characterized by excessive and chronic worry. Option C - Bipolar disorder: Bipolar disorder is a mood disorder characterized by alternating periods of depression and mania or hypomania. While there may be some overlap in symptoms such as fatigue, changes in appetite, and altered mood between Addison's disease and bipolar disorder, the underlying causes and nature of the conditions are different. Addison's disease results from adrenal gland dysfunction, whereas bipolar disorder involves disturbances in mood regulation.

In this case, the individual would have ongoing depressive symptoms for at least two years (dysthymia) and then experience a distinct period of more severe depressive symptoms meeting the criteria for major depressive disorder. Incorrect Options: Option A - Major depressive disorder from 2 years: While it is possible to have a chronic course of major depressive disorder, the specific term \"double depression\" is not used to describe this condition. Major depressive disorder itself can be a recurrent and chronic condition, but double depression specifically refers to the co-occurrence of MDD and dysthymia. Option B - Major depression with OCD: Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder (OCD) is a separate psychiatric disorder characterized by intrusive thoughts (obsessions) and repetitive behaviors or mental acts (compulsions). While individuals with OCD may also experience depressive symptoms, the term \"double depression\" is not used to describe this combination. Double depression specifically involves the coexistence of major depressive disorder and dysthymia.

It refers to the sensation of unease or discomfort in the stomach, often accompanied by a desire to vomit. Approximately 20% of patients may experience nausea when starting treatment with an SSRI like escitalopram. However, it's important to note that this side effect is usually temporary and tends to improve over time as the body adjusts to the medication. Option B - Vivid dreams: Vivid dreams, also known as intense or abnormal dreams, can occur as a side effect of escitalopram. Some individuals may experience more vivid or unusual dreams while taking this medication. These dreams can be highly detailed, emotional, or even bizarre. While vivid dreams are not as common as nausea, they are still a recognized side effect of escitalopram and other SSRIs. Option C - Anorgasmia: Anorgasmia refers to the difficulty or inability to achieve orgasm. It is a potential side effect of escitalopram and other SSRIs. Anorgasmia can affect both men and women and is thought to be related to the medication's impact on serotonin levels in the brain. It's important to note that not all individuals will experience this side effect, and for those who do, it may resolve over time or with dosage adjustments. Reference: Prepladder Notes",

Close monitoring of blood lithium levels is necessary to maintain therapeutic efficacy while avoiding toxicity. Incorrect Options: Option A - Delayed absorption: This statement is not true for lithium. Lithium is generally rapidly and almost completely absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract after oral administration. Peak blood levels are typically reached within 1 to 4 hours. Option C - Protein-bound: This statement is not true for lithium. Lithium is primarily a monovalent cation and is not extensively bound to plasma proteins. It is mainly distributed in the extracellular fluid, including intracellular compartments. Option D - Can be given safely in renal dysfunction: This statement is not entirely accurate. Lithium is primarily eliminated by the kidneys, and renal dysfunction can affect its clearance. In patients with renal impairment, the clearance of lithium may be decreased, leading to higher blood levels and an increased risk of toxicity. Therefore, lithium use in renal dysfunction requires careful monitoring and dosage adjustments to avoid excessive accumulation and potential toxicity. Reference: Prepladder Notes",
