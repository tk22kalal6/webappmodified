      "question": "A 32 y/o woman named Sarah goes missing after a traumatic breakup. Two weeks later, she is found in a different city, identifying herself as \"Lily\" and claiming she has always lived there. She cannot recall any details of her past or her true identity. What is the most likely diagnosis for Sarah?",

        "A": "Dissociative Amnesia",
        "B": "Possession Trance Disorder",
        "C": "Depersonalization Disorder",
        "D": "Dissociative Fugue"
      },
      "correct_answer": "D",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: D) Dissociative Fugue Explanation: Given the sudden travel and complete memory loss regarding her past identity, Sarah’s situation aligns with a dissociative fugue . Dissociative fugue (Option D) Dissociative fugue, a subtype of dissociative amnesia, involves sudden, unexpected travel away from home accompanied by memory loss about one’s past and potential identity confusion or loss, lasting from minutes to months, and is also not attributable to substance effects or medical conditions. Example: Mr. D from Delhi faced financial loss and stress, leading to his sudden disappearance. A month later, a friend found someone resembling Mr. D as Mr.C in Chennai. When asked to return home, the man claimed to be Mr. C, a shop helper in Chennai, not Mr. D. Dissociative amnesia (Option A ruled out) Dissociative amnesia is characterized by an inability to recall significant personal information, typically related to trauma or stress, that exceeds ordinary forgetfulness and is not due to physiological causes or substance use or injury. Patients may experience symptoms like depression, derealization, and physical manifestations, frequently related to past abuse or trauma. Example: A man rescued two days after his kidnapping couldn’t recall anything from that period when questioned by police or family. However, he remembered everything before and after the incident. Due to excessive stress, his mind dissociated some parts of his memory from the other functions. Possession Trance Disorder (Option B): This disorder involves trance states in which there is a marked alteration in the individual’s state of consciousness and the individual’s customary sense of personal identity is replaced by an external ‘possessing’ identity and in which the individual’s behaviours or movements are experienced as being controlled by the possessing agent. an individual adopting a new identity believed to be influenced by an external entity. Sarah’s case does not suggest any belief in possession or behaviour linked to external influences. Depersonalization Disorder (Option C):",

      "question": "A 40 y/o woman visits a cultural healer, stating that she sometimes feels overwhelmed by a spirit that speaks through her. During these episodes, she adopts a distinct persona, telling her family to respect certain traditions as if she were that spirit. After the episodes, she cannot recall what transpired and feels distressed about her lack of control. Based on this description, what is the most likely diagnosis for this patient?",

      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: B) Possession Trance Disorder Explanation: Possession Trance Disorder is characterized by episodic identity change attributed to a spirit, culturally specific behaviours, and amnesia, fitting the woman's experience perfectly. Trance Disorder : (Option A ruled out) Characterized by a temporary and marked alteration in consciousness or loss of personal identity without the emergence of an alternate identity. Key Features: Marked change in consciousness. Loss of customary sense of personal identity. No replacement by an alternate identity. Example: A teenage girl was brought to the ER after she suddenly entered a trance-like state during a family gathering. She remained unresponsive to external stimuli for several hours, with no recollection of the event and no awareness of her surroundings during the episode Possession Trance Disorder: A variant of dissociative trance involves episodes where an individual’s customary identity is exchanged for a new identity, often attributed to a spirit, deity, or another person. Key Features: Episodic alterations in consciousness. Presence of stereotypical, culturally determined behaviours. Experience of an entity controlling the individual. Partial or full amnesia regarding the episode. Example: A newly married woman claims to be possessed by her deceased grandmother, speaking in a different voice and urging her in-laws to care for her. She later insists she was unaware of her actions. Derealization Disorder (Option C) involves feeling detached from surroundings. The woman does not describe this feeling, so it doesn't match her symptoms. Multiple Personality Disorder (Option D) involves distinct personality states developed within the individual. The woman’s experience is attributed to a spirit, not a new personality, making this diagnosis unsuitable. Reference: Kaplan and Soddock Psychiatry, 12th Edition, Page 1423 Example",

      "question": "A 28-year-old woman reports feeling as if she’s living in a dream, with her surroundings appearing foggy and unreal. She recognizes that everything is real but feels detached from her surroundings, and people seem distant or cartoon-like. These episodes last from a few minutes to several hours and have been occurring for months, causing significant anxiety and interfering with her daily activities. What is the most likely diagnosis?",

        "D": "Dissociative Fugue"
      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: B) Derealization Disorder Explanation: Feelings of detachment from the world and experiences of unreality characterize Derealization Disorder. The patient's description of feeling disconnected from his environment appearing foggy and her perception of people as distant or cartoon-like perfectly matches this disorder. Depersonalization-derealization disorder Depersonalisation Derealization A feeling of detachment from the self A feeling of detachment from the world The person may feel like they are watching themselves from outside the body. (Option A ruled out) The person feels as if the world is unreal. The brain uses defensive mechanisms to protect against acute anxiety or trauma, which can lead to recurring feelings of depersonalization or derealization. Depersonalization disorder causes individuals to feel as if their experiences are not real and often describe their experiences with “As if”, but they maintain intact reality testing, knowing what's real and what's not. Differential Diagnosis Seizure Disorders Migraines Substance use like Cannabis and Lysergic Acid Diethylamide (LSD) Head injury. Dissociative Identity Disorder (Multiple Personality Disorder) (Option C ruled out) The presence of two or more distinct identities or personality states is called alters . Each identity has its own way of perceiving and interacting with the environment and self. More than two personalities are possible as well. DID is characterized by symptoms such as amnesia, depersonalization, and derealization. A key diagnostic feature is the experience of \"losing time,\" which goes beyond ordinary forgetfulness. The disorder presents diverse signs and symptoms, complicating diagnosis. Only one personality shows at a time, with the second personality usually unaware of the first, or it may know about the primary one. This is different from possession trance disorder, where both personalities exist together but one controls the person's behavior. Example: Ms P returns home to find photos on her social media with strangers she appears to know, but she has no memory of the experience. Her first identity lived through it, while her second identity remains unaware. Dissociative Fugue (Option D) involves sudden, unexpected travel away from home or customary work locations, often accompanied by an inability to recall one's past. The patient's symptoms do not include travel or amnesia for identity.",

She is unaware of any psychological reason for her pain, but the support from family and friends reinforces her focus on the symptoms. She shows no signs of exaggerating her condition for personal gain. What is the most likely factor contributing to the maintenance of her symptoms?",

        "D": "Secondary Gain"
      },
      "correct_answer": "D",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: D) Secondary Gain Explanation: Secondary gain is the most likely factor contributing to the maintenance of her symptoms, as her chronic pain elicits sympathy and support from others, reinforcing her focus on the condition. Conversion Disorder(Functional neurological disorder) Predominantly, the symptoms of conversion disorder are neurological and are paradoxically experienced as involuntary, or lacking in self-agency. Seen in Females > males Onset- Late childhood to early adulthood. Presentation of conversion disorder: Presents with symptoms suggestive of deficit in motor or sensory functions or both. But without any evidence of any physical disorder. Reason- Too much stress has converted the stress into these neurological symptoms. At times, the symptoms are inconsistent with the anatomy and physiology of the body. E.g. inconsistent tremors. Sensory symptoms Motor symptoms Paresthesia Anesthesia Deafness Blindness Hemianesthesia Abnormal movement Paralysis, paresis Gait disturbances Astasia-abasia gait Pseudo seizures Various gains in conversion disorder: Gains Features Examples Primary Gains Achieved by keeping the internal conflicts outside the awareness. Done unconsciously by producing the symptoms that reduce the internal conflicts (internal gains). (Option B ruled out) A person facing exam stress develops blindness, which helps keep his anxiety out of awareness. He becomes more focused on his blindness than on studying or preparing for the exam. Secondary Gains Advantages or benefits a person gets as a result of getting sick (external gains) . (Option A ruled out) The person is excused from studying due to sickness, receives family support, and is relieved of duties and responsibilities. Tertiary Gains Sometimes the whole family will get the benefit because of the illness. The parents receive money from relatives for treatment and get relief from their jobs to care for the patient. Example: A seven-year-old girl overhears her parents arguing about divorce and suddenly reports blindness. After a thorough examination, she is found to be normal, indicating classical conversion disorder. Due to high stress, the mind converts that stress into neurological symptoms, such as blindness. La Belle Indifference (Option C ruled out) La belle indifférence refers to a patient’s inappropriate lack of concern regarding severe symptoms, which can appear in conditions like conversion disorder. While it may also be seen in seriously ill patients who develop a stoic attitude, it is not exclusive to conversion disorder. For instance, the girl who is not able to see; may be sitting very",

      "question": "A 30 y/o woman, recently rescued from a religious cult, exhibits severe anxiety and difficulty trusting others, struggling with her identity and beliefs. Which of the following best describes the primary focus of treatment for individuals who have experienced this condition?",
      "options": {
        "A": "Immediate medication to suppress symptoms",
        "B": "Deprogramming through intensive psychotherapy",
        "C": "Short-term counselling sessions",
        "D": "Isolation from social interactions"
      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: B) Deprogramming through intensive psychotherapy Explanation: Deprogramming through intensive psychotherapy is the correct answer as the treatment primarily involves reversing brainwashing effects through intensive psychotherapy, which is essential in addressing the psychological manipulation experienced. Brainwashing Definition : Brainwashing is the deliberate psychological manipulation involving isolation, intimidation, and coercion, causing identity disturbance and culture shock. It aims to break down coping skills, leading to significant personality and belief changes. Treatment of Brainwashing Deprogramming : Involves reversing the effects of brainwashing through intensive psychotherapy and confrontation, particularly effective with religious cult members. Psychotherapy : Focuses on deconstructing harmful beliefs and restoring individual autonomy Reeducation : This involves guiding the individual through a gradual process of learning and accepting new, healthier thought patterns, challenging the beliefs that were forcibly imposed during brainwashing. Long-Term : Treatment is usually long-term, focusing on rebuilding healthy self-esteem and coping skills, especially in those with PTSD and dissociative symptoms. Immediate medication to suppress symptoms (Option A): While medication may be used to manage specific symptoms, it is not the primary focus of treatment for brainwashing. Short-term counselling sessions (Option C): Brainwashing treatment is generally long-term, focusing on reeducation and ongoing support rather than short-term interventions. Isolation from social interactions (Option D): Isolation can be a tactic used in brainwashing but is not a treatment strategy; rather, the treatment aims to re-engage individuals with supportive social interactions.

      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: B) Illness Anxiety Disorder Explanation: The patient has persistent anxiety about having a serious illness with minimal physical symptoms, aligning with the characteristics of Illness anxiety disorder. Somatic symptom disorder (SSD) Illness anxiety disorder (IAD) Definition : Persistent excessive anxiety and preoccupation with one or more somatic symptoms, often triggered by a history of stressors, despite medical evidence showing no significant findings. Symptoms : Anxiety, distress, and excessive focus on symptoms or health, with significant time and energy devoted to them. Duration : Symptoms persist for ≥ 6 months (DSM-5) or ≥ 2 years (ICD-10). Psychosocial Impact : Causes significant distress or functional impairment in social, interpersonal, or familial areas. Severity Specifiers (DSM-5): Mild: 1 symptom Moderate: ≥ 2 symptoms Severe: ≥ 2 symptoms with multiple or severe complaints Symptom Specifier : Predominant pain Exclusions : Symptoms are not due to malingering or identifiable medical causes. Definition : Persistent preoccupation with having or developing a serious illness, despite minimal or no physical symptoms and evidence to the contrary. Symptoms : Preoccupation with health and fear of illness. Excessive health-related behaviours (e.g., frequent medical visits) or avoidance of medical care. Anxiety and distress related to the belief. Duration : Symptoms persist for ≥ 6 months (DSM-5). Specifiers : Care-seeking type : Frequent reassurance from medical providers. Care-avoidant type : Avoids medical appointments due to fear. Key Difference : Unlike somatic symptom disorder, patients have minimal physical symptoms but are fixated on potential illness Differential Diagnosis: Delusional disorder (Somatic type) Hypochondriasis : The ICD-10 equivalent of illness anxiety disorder, characterized by a persistent fear of having a serious illness despite little to no physical symptoms. Somatic Symptom Disorder (Option A) : This disorder involves a persistent belief in having a serious undetected disease with significant somatic symptoms, which is not the case here. Munchausen Syndrome (Option C) is incorrect because the patient is not deliberately fabricating or inducing symptoms to assume the sick role, as seen in Munchausen Syndrome. Malingering (Option D) implies the intentional fabrication of symptoms for secondary gain, which is not suggested in the scenario.

      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: C) Factitious Disorder Imposed on Another Explanation: The mother is inducing or fabricating symptoms in her child to seek medical attention and assumes the sick role indirectly, which aligns with this diagnosis. Disorder Factitious disorder Factitious Disorder Imposed on Another Definition Feigning or inducing illness for medical care without external rewards (formerly Munchausen syndrome). A caregiver (often a parent) induces or fabricates illness in a dependent (often a child). Motivation Desire to assume the sick role without external incentives. The caregiver assumes the sick role by proxy or seeks to relieve caretaking duties. Symptoms Fabrication of symptoms Self-harm Manipulation of lab tests Demand for invasive treatments. Faked illness Altered medical records Unnecessary treatments The child's condition improves away from the caregiver. Clues to Diagnosis Multiple hospital visits with inconsistent symptoms Eager for invasive procedures Noncompliance with treatment History in healthcare Disputed claims by lab tests. Repeated hospital visits Altered samples Unexplained injuries Improvement in the child when separated from the caregiver. Factitious Disorder (Option A) : This disorder involves the individual feigning illness for themselves, not for another person. Somatic Symptom Disorder (Option B) : This diagnosis is characterized by excessive focus on somatic symptoms without feigning or fabricating illnesses.

      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: B) Body Integrity Dysphoria (BID) Explanation: The man's intense discomfort with his healthy limb and desire for amputation align with BIID , characterized by feelings that certain body parts do not belong. Body Integrity Identity Dysphoria (BID): Definition : A condition where individuals feel that a healthy body part does not belong, leading to desires for amputation or paralysis. Symptoms : Strong desire to be physically disabled or without a body part. Discomfort with healthy body parts. Preoccupation disrupting social activities. Behaviors mimicking disability despite being healthy. Self-harm or self-mutilation of unwanted body parts. Commonly Affected Body Parts : Most commonly legs (especially the left leg), also arms, fingers, toes, eyes, ears, and teeth. Causes : Potentially linked to brain abnormalities affecting body perception (somatosensory cortex, parietal lobe, insula). Complications : Risks from self-harm include bleeding, infection, nerve damage, severe pain, and phantom limb pain. Diagnosis : Conducted by psychiatrists via discussions on body perception with the patient; recognized in ICD-11 but not in DSM-5. Treatment : Cognitive behavioural therapy and medications for depression/anxiety. Use of prosthetics or mobility aids. Virtual reality simulations to explore life without a body part. No single treatment exists; focus on reducing distress and harmful behaviours. Malingering: (Option A ruled out) Definition : Deliberate falsification of symptoms for secondary gain (e.g., avoiding military duty, financial compensation, evading prosecution). Contexts for Malingering : Criminal Context : Pretending incompetence or insanity to avoid trial. Military Context : Feigning illness to evade conscription or hazardous duties. Financial Gain : Seeking undeserved benefits eg. disability insurance. Social Responsibility : Escaping unpleasant situations. Epidemiology : Higher prevalence in military, prison, and litigious populations, particularly among men. Associated Disorders : Conduct and anxiety disorders in children; antisocial, borderline, and narcissistic personality disorders in adults. Course and Prognosis : Malingering persists as long as rewards are anticipated; symptoms fade once goals are met. Ignoring behaviour in structured environments may reduce it. Treatment : Maintain neutrality; conduct differential diagnosis. Tactfully confront suspected malingering and explore motivations. Assess for coexisting psychiatric disorders. Engagement is essential unless the patient is manipulative. Conversion Disorder (Option C) : This disorder presents with neurological symptoms that are",

      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: B) Resistance Stage Explanation: The patient's symptoms, including irritability, concentration difficulties, and muscle tension, suggest he is in the resistance stage, where the body is attempting to cope with stress but is showing signs of strain. Stress and General Adaptation Syndrome (GAS): Stress is a physiological and psychological response to challenging situations; GAS describes the body's response to stress. Stages of GAS: 1. Alarm Reaction Stage Immediate fight-or-flight response. (Option A ruled out) Increased heart rate and release of adrenaline and cortisol. 2. Resistance Stage The body recovers itself while remaining on high alert. Signs include irritability, frustration, and poor concentration. 3. Exhaustion Stage Prolonged stress depletes resources. Symptoms include fatigue, burnout, anxiety, and a weakened immune system. (Option C ruled out) Organ Systems Affected due to stress: Cardiovascular Acute stress: Increases heart rate and blood pressure. Chronic stress: Risk factors for hypertension, heart attack, and stroke. Respiratory Stress: Causes shortness of breath; worsens asthma. Management: Breathing techniques can alleviate symptoms. Gastrointestinal Stress: Impacts gut health, alters appetite; can exacerbate IBS. Musculoskeletal Effects: Muscle tension leads to headaches and chronic pain. Relief: Relaxation techniques reduce tension. Endocrine Activation: The HPA axis leads to increased cortisol. Consequences: Chronic high cortisol impairs immune function. Nervous system Response: Activates SNS for “fight or flight.” Long-term: Chronic activation leads to body wear and tear. Reproductive Male: Lowers testosterone, impacting libido and sperm quality. Female: Disrupts menstrual cycles, and fertility; increases anxiety in pregnancy and menopause. Recovery Stage (Option D) : This stage implies the patient is starting to recover from stress, which is not the case given his current symptoms.

Pseudocyesis/ Phantom pregnancy It is a rare condition where a nonpregnant individual exhibits signs and symptoms of pregnancy. The symptoms are real and can mimic actual pregnancy, but there is no fetal development. Symptoms: Abdominal distension Breast enlargement Skin pigmentation changes Cessation of menses Morning sickness Causes: Strong desire to become pregnant Multiple miscarriages Loss of a child Infertility Sexual abuse Treatments for phantom pregnancy include: Clinical tests that disprove pregnancy- The first step in treating pseudocyesis is to reassure the individual they are not pregnant, typically using ultrasound to show the absence of a fetus. Psychodynamic and Supportive Psychotherapy Medications such as antidepressants or antipsychotics Hormonal therapy- Helps the person get their menstrual period. Uterine dilation and curettage (D&C) Pseudologia fantastica (Option A) involves uncontrollable lying and the creation of elaborate fantasies. The patient’s symptoms focus on the belief of being pregnant, not on lying or creating fantasies Nihilism (Option C) involves a delusion of the nonexistence of self or a part of self or an extreme rejection of established values.

The presence of disorientation, hallucinations, and the recent stressor fits with this diagnosis. Ganser Syndrome Definition : A condition characterized by giving approximate answers (paralogia) alongside clouded consciousness, hallucinations, and dissociative or conversion symptoms. Epidemiology : More common in men. Precipitating Factors : Stress, personal conflicts, brain injury, childhood adversity Clinical Features : Paralogia : Incorrect but related answers (e.g., 2 + 2 = 5). Clouded consciousness : Disorientation, amnesia, impaired reality testing. Hallucinations : Visual/auditory in about 50% of cases. Dissociative symptoms : Amnesia, conversion, trance-like states. Hysterical stigmata : Non-neurologic analgesia, shifting hyperalgesia. Differential Diagnosis : Includes organic brain syndromes (seizures, trauma, dementia), Korsakoff syndrome, and dissociative identity disorder. Treatment : Supportive care in a hospital setting. Low-dose antipsychotics may help. Exploration of stressors (hypnosis), avoid confronting incorrect answers. Prognosis : Recovery is usually within days, up to a month. Korsakoff syndrome (Option A) involves amnesia and confabulation, typically associated with chronic alcohol use and thiamine deficiency, which is not present in this case. Dissociative Identity Disorder (Option B) involves the presence of two or more distinct identities or personalities, which is not described in the scenario. Schizophrenia (Option D) could present with hallucinations, but it does not typically involve giving approximate answers (paralogia), and the rapid onset of symptoms makes Ganser syndrome more likely.
