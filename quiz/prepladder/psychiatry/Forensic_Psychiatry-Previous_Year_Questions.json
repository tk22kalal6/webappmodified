      "correct_answer": "D",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: D) Advance directive Explanation: The Mental Health Care Act 2017 in India allows patients to create an advance directive , which enables them to select their caregiver and outline their treatment preferences for the future, especially in situations where they may be unable to make decisions due to their mental health condition. Advance directives of the Mental Health Care Act, 2017: Every person who is not a minor can create an advance directive. Individuals can specify how they wish to be treated for a mental illness. Individuals can specify how they do not want to be treated for a mental illness. Individuals can appoint a nominated representative. The nominated representative's role is activated only when the individual loses the capacity to make decisions. The psychiatrist or medical officer in charge of treatment is responsible for ensuring that care aligns with the patient's advance directive. The patient, caregiver, or nominated representative is responsible for providing access to the advance directive for the psychiatrist or medical officer in charge. The doctor cannot be held liable if unforeseen consequences arise from following a valid advance directive. Advance directives are not applicable in emergency treatment situations.

      "explanation": "Correct Answer: A) Suicide occurring at the time when the patient starts to recover Explanation: Paradoxical suicide refers to suicide occurring when the patient begins to show signs of recovery from a depressive or psychiatric episode. It is believed that during recovery, the patient may have gained enough energy or motivation to carry out the act that they were previously too lethargic or hopeless to perform. It is called paradoxical, as one might expect that the risk of suicide reduces as the patient recovers, but actually, the risk of suicide is increased.
