      "question": "Which mental functions are examined in the Mental State Examination (100-7)?",
      "options": {
        "A": "Judgment",
        "B": "Language",
        "C": "Orientation",
        "D": "Concentration"
      },
      "correct_answer": "D",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer D - Concentration The Mental State Examination (MSE) often uses the 100-7 test to assess concentration. In this test, the patient is asked to subtract 7 from 100 and subtract 7 from each resulting number for one minute. The number of correct responses is recorded. Concentration, defined as the ability to focus and maintain attention on a task, can also be evaluated in the MSE through activities such as counting backwards or reciting the months of the year in reverse order. Mental Status Examination (MSE): The Mental Status Examination (MSE) is the psychiatric counterpart to a physical examination used in the rest of medicine. It examines all aspects of mental functioning and identifies signs and symptoms indicative of mental illness. It provides a “snapshot” of the patient’s mental state at the time of the assessment. Cognitive evaluation in MSE is usually done in the form of a Mini-Mental Status Examination (MMSE). Aspects of MSE: General description: Appearance and behaviour Motor activity Speech Emotional state: Mood: subjective experience of patient’s internal and sustained emotional state Affect: expression of mood (that appears to the clinician) Thinking : Thought content Thought process Perceptual disturbances Cognition (higher mental function): most commonly evaluated by Mini-Mental Status Examination (MMSE) Orientation Registration Attention & calculation Memory (immediate, recent & long term) Abstract reasoning Insight & Judgement Judgment (Option A) refers to a person's ability to make sound decisions and choices. It involves considering multiple options, weighing the pros and cons, and deciding based on reason and logic. Judgment can be assessed in the MSE by asking the patient to solve a hypothetical problem, such as what they would do if they found a stamped envelope on the street. Language (Option B) refers to a person's ability to communicate effectively using spoken or written words. Language can be assessed in the MSE by asking the patient to name objects, repeat phrases, describe a picture, or write a sentence. Orientation (Option C) refers to people’s awareness of their surroundings and place in time and space. Orientation can be assessed in the MSE by asking the patient to state their name, the date, location, and the reason for their hospitalisation.

      "question": "A teacher demonstrates the proper handwashing technique to her students, who then practice it both at school and at home. What type of learning does this scenario represent?",
      "options": {
        "A": "Cognitive",
        "B": "Psychomotor",
        "C": "Affective",
        "D": "Affective and cognitive"
      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: B) Psychomotor Explanation: The steps of handwashing demonstrated by the teacher and performed by the students are an example of Psychomotor learning. Domains of learning Psychomotor Psychomotor learning involves acquiring physical skills and coordination through observation, practice and repetition, and the usage of motor skill areas of the brain. It is measured based on speed, precision, distance and procedure in execution It includes imitation, manipulation, precision, articulation and naturalisation E.g., An intern learning how to insert an IV cannula by observing the staff nurse Affective learning (Option C) Includes domain of attitude and values It includes emotions, feelings, attitudes, and values It encompasses the subjective experiences and expressions of emotions. E.g., communicating with patients with empathy Cognitive learning (Option A) It refers to mental processes related to knowledge acquisition, understanding, thinking, and problem-solving. It involves perception, memory, attention, language, and reasoning processes.

      "question": "Which of the following is a formal thought disorder?",
      "options": {
        "A": "Obsession",
        "B": "Derailment",
        "C": "Delusion",
        "D": "Thought insertion"
      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: B) Derailment Explanation: Derailment, also known as loosening of associations, is a formal thought disorder characterized by a disruption in the normal flow of thoughts, leading to tangential or incoherent speech. It is a symptom commonly associated with certain psychiatric conditions, such as schizophrenia or bipolar disorder. Abnormal thought process Derailment Sudden or gradual deviation in thought (without blocking) is often used synonymously with loosening associations. Talking Past the Point (Vorbeireden) The patient responds with incorrect answers related to the topic despite understanding the question. Example: Saying \"white\" for grass colour and \"green\" for snow colour. Seen in hysterical pseudodementia ( dissociative disorder) and Ganser’s syndrome (approximate answers). It also occurs in acute schizophrenia , especially in adolescents (hebephrenia). Loosening of Associations Disorganised thought progression, shifting between unrelated topics, leading to incoherent communication. Incoherence Disconnected, disorganised, or incomprehensible speech. Word Salad : Incoherent, incomprehensible mixture of words and phrases, often seen in advanced schizophrenia. Word Approximation Using conventional words in an unconventional way (e.g., \"hand shoes\" for gloves) It is distinguished from a neologism, a newly created word with an unclear or unknown origin. Obsessions (Option A) are intrusive, persistent, unwanted thoughts, images, or urges that cause distress and anxiety. Delusions (Option C) are false beliefs that are firmly held despite clear evidence. It is a disorder of contentment of thought . Thought insertion (Option D) is the belief that one's thoughts are being controlled or inserted into one's mind by an external force or entity. It is a disorder of the possession of thoughts.

      "question": "In the physiology viva, the examiner inquires about the individual who initially recorded the first EEG. You respond by admitting that you are unaware of the answer. Sympathetic to your lack of knowledge, the examiner provides a hint indicating that the name resembles a common item found at McDonald's. With this clue, you are able to recall the name and provide the correct response. Which form of memory is involved in this situation?",
      "options": {
        "A": "Semantic memory",
        "B": "Implicit memory",
        "C": "Associative learning",
        "D": "Priming"
      },
      "correct_answer": "D",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: D) Priming Explanation: In this scenario, the examiner's hint helps you recall the name of the individual who recorded the first EEG. This is an example of priming , which involves the exposure to a clue or stimulus that indirectly influences your ability to retrieve information from memory. It helps with faster recognition or processing of similar stimuli without conscious awareness. Incorrect Options: Semantic memory (Option A) is a type of explicit memory that involves storing and recalling factual information and general knowledge, such as knowing the capital of a country or understanding historical events. While you are recalling factual information about the first EEG, the specific retrieval mechanism, in this case, is priming, not semantic memory. Implicit memory (Option B), non-declarative memory, involves unconscious processes that influence thoughts and behaviours. Priming is a type of Implicit memory, including procedural Memory and associative and non-associative learning. However, this is not the correct answer, as Priming explains the situation more specifically. Associative learning (Option C) involves learning through association , typically in the context of classical or operant conditioning and doesn’t exactly fit this context as you're recalling a specific fact rather than learning through associations.

      "question": "Which one of the options below is not classified as a form of subcortical dementia?",
      "options": {
        "A": "Pick’s disease",
        "B": "Parkinson’s disease",
        "C": "Huntington’s disease",
        "D": "Wilson’s disease"
      },
      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: A) Pick’s disease Explanation: Pick’s disease is a form of frontotemporal dementia that involves the progressive degeneration of the frontal and temporal lobes of the brain. It is characterised by early personality and behavioural changes, including disinhibition, lack of empathy, and hyperorality , while other cognitive functions remain intact initially. Frontotemporal Dementia (Pick Disease) Affects frontotemporal regions with atrophy. It involves neuronal loss , gliosis , and Pick bodies , which are hallmark features of this condition. Accounts for about 5% of irreversible dementias. More common in men, especially with a family history. Early symptoms include personality and behavioural changes; other cognitive functions are preserved. Typically, it begins before age 75; familial cases may start earlier. Features like hypersexuality and hyperorality are more common than in Alzheimer’s disease. Difficult to distinguish from Alzheimer’s in early stages. Incorrect Options: Parkinson’s disease (Option B) is a neurodegenerative disorder that can lead to subcortical dementia . The underlying neurodegeneration is in the basal ganglia , which is part of the subcortical structures. It can progress to dementia, especially when cognitive symptoms appear later in the disease course. Huntington’s disease (Option C) is another condition that causes subcortical dementia . It is a hereditary neurodegenerative disorder that primarily affects the basal ganglia and leads to cognitive decline, psychiatric symptoms, and motor abnormalities. Wilson’s disease (Option D) is a metabolic disorder that results in abnormal copper accumulation in the liver, brain, and other organs. It can lead to subcortical dementia due to its effects on the basal ganglia , and it may also cause neurological and psychiatric symptoms.

Delusional people could have strong convictions about topics others consider illogical or untrue. Incorrect Options: Option B. Affect refers to emotions and mood. It is a short-term or cross-sectional emotional state. It may include disorders like depression and bipolar disorder . Option C. Perception refers to the interpretation of sensory information. It may include disorders like illusion and hallucination. Option D. Memory involves the encoding, storage, and retrieval of information.

      "explanation": "their own mental illness. A score of 3 on the insight scale indicates \"Insight present but overvalued ideation.\" Patient recognizes that there is something wrong with them mentally but attributes it to an external factor (the summer season). This suggests that the patient has some insight into their condition, but their understanding may be influenced by overvalued ideas or beliefs. Incorrect options: Option A suggests \"Slight awareness of illness.\" This would not be an appropriate score as the patient demonstrates more than slight awareness by attributing their mental state to the summer season. Option C suggests \"Insight present but not consistent.\" This would also not be an appropriate score as the patient's insight is consistent, albeit influenced by overvalued ideation. Option D suggests \"Good insight.\" This would not be an appropriate score as the patient's insight is influenced by overvalued ideas, indicating a less than optimal level of insight. Reference: .",
