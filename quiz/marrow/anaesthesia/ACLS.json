      },
      "correct_answer": "d",
      "explanation": "The patient is in atrial fibrillation but his hemodynamic status is normal. So the treatment of \nchoice is IV Ibutilide. Ibutilide is a class III antiarrhythmic drug that has a rapid onset of action. It restores sinus \nrhythm by prolonging the action potential duration and effective refractory period. It is administered at a dose of 1 mg over 10 minutes. If necessary, a second dose can be \nadministered 10 minutes after the first. If there is evidence of hemodynamic deterioration, immediate cardioversion is the treatment of \nchoice. Cardioversion is a synchronized administration of shock as the timing is typically synchronized \nwith the R waves or QRS complex of a cardiac cycle. On the other hand, random administration of \nshock anywhere in between a cardiac cycle is termed as Defibrillation which is non-synchronized. However, the mechanism for both processes is quite similar. The electric current is made to travel \nfrom the negative to the positive electrode in such a way that it traverses the entire myocardium at \nonce to conduct a simultaneous contraction of each cell of the heart muscle. It is made to \ninterrupt any ongoing abnormal electrical activity by terminating it so that the sinus node can \ntake back the charge and resume its normal pacemaker activity. Cardioversion is typically performed under induction or sedation using a short-acting agent such \nas midazolam, unless the patient is hemodynamically unstable or if cardiovascular collapse is \nimminent. Defibrillation is more of an emergent maneuver and, when necessary, should be \npreferably performed in conjunction with or prior to the administration of induction or sedative \nagents. Energy may be delivered through mainly two waveforms in defibrillators that are monophasic or \nbiphasic. 166 \nSold by @itachibot Monophasic defibrillation delivers a charge in only one direction as opposed to biphasic \ndefibrillation delivering a charge in one direction for half of the shock and in the electrically \nopposite direction for the second half. Biphasic waveforms are adopted in newer defibrillators as they deliver a more consistent \nmagnitude of the current which successfully terminates arrhythmias at lower energies than \nmonophasic waveform defibrillators. Energy selection for defibrillation or cardioversion. Following are the guidelines for initial energy \nrequirements issued by the American Heart Association in 2010. Atrial fibrillation energy requirements are as follows: • 200 Joules for monophasic devices • 120-200 Joules for biphasic devices Atrial flutter energy requirements are as follows: • 100 Joules for monophasic devices • 50-100 Joules for biphasic devices Ventricular tachycardia with pulse energy requirements are as follows: • 200 Joules for monophasic devices • 100 Joules for biphasic devices Ventricular fibrillation or pulseless ventricular tachycardia energy requirements are as follows: • 360 Joules for monomorphic devices • 120-200 Joules for biphasic devices Indications for defibrillation Indications for electrical card \nioversion Pulseless ventricular tachycar \ndia (VT)Ventricular fibrillatio \nn (VF)Cardiac arrestdue to or \nresulting in VF Supraventricular tachycardia( \natrioventricular nodal reentr \nant tachycardia [AVNRT] and \natrioventricular reentrant ta \nchycardia [AVRT])Atrial fibril \nlationAtrial flutter(types I an \nd II)Ventricular tachycardia( \nwith a pulse)Any patient with \nre-entranttachycardia withna \nrrow or wide QRScomplex (v \nentricular rate >150 bpm) wh \no isunstable(eg, ischemic che \nst pain, acute pulmonary ede \nma, hypotension, acute altere \nd mental status, signs of shoc \nk) 167 \nSold by @itachibot",

Antiarrhythmic therapy for stable wide QRS tachycardia include procainamide, amiodarone, or \nsotalol. Synchronized cardioversion is considered when the patient is unstable. When a patient is in tachyarrhythmia typically with a heart rate of 150 per minute, the initial \nintervention consists of identifying and treating the underlying cause. This includes: • Maintaining a patent airway and assisting breathing as necessary • Administering oxygen if hypoxemic • Attaching cardiac monitor to identify rhythm; monitor blood pressure and oximetry When there is persistent tachyarrhythmia, the management is as depicted by the flowchart (based \non the AHA guidelines) below: 168 \nSold by @itachibot Option B: Adenosine is used in regular narrow complex tachycardia.

Torsade \nrhythm is most commonly is seen in association with hypomagnesemia and hypokalemia. Torsades de pointes is a polymorphic ventricular tachycardia meaning “twisting of the points,” \ncharacterized by twisting of the QRS axis around the baseline and a polymorphic appearance. There is QT interval prolongation in the ECG due to a non-uniform delay in repolarization. The other cause of torsades de pointes include: • Drugs like quinidine, procainamide, disopyramide, and phenothiazine (amiodarone is rarely \nassociated with torsades de pointes because the delay in repolarization induced by it is uniform). • Bradycardia • Acute ischemia or infarction Management: • Discontinue the offending drug • Correct electrolyte abnormalities, pH and hypoxia • Magnesium sulphate infusion • Increase the heart rate - electrical pacing, isoproterenol infusion, or intravenous atropine 169 \nSold by @itachibot",

The management of ventricular fibrillation and pulseless ventricular tachycardia (shockable \nrhythms) is the same. Immediate chest compression is to be started. It is of utmost necessity to defibrillate at the earliest because the chances of survival decrease by \n7-10% every minute without defibrillation. Defibrillation involves delivering an electrical current between two pads placed on the chest so as \nto interrupt the disorganized cardiac activity and restore an organized cardiac rhythm or asystole \nfor at least 5 seconds. The energy that must be applied is • Monophasic defibrillator– 360 J • Biphasic defibrillator- 120 J 171 \nSold by @itachibot",

      "correct_answer": "b",
      "explanation": "Chest compressions should be resumed immediately following shock delivery. Pulse check and reanalysis of the cardiac rhythm is performed only after 2 minutes of chest \ncompression and rescue breaths. This is because the heart is temporarily stunned by a \ndefibrillator shock and so chest compressions would benefit the patient by providing coronary \nblood flow during this period. Defibrillation involves delivering an electrical current between two pads placed on the chest so as \nto interrupt disorganized cardiac activity and restore an organized cardiac rhythm or asystole for \nat least 5 seconds. It is of utmost necessity to defibrillate immediately because the chances of \nsurvival decrease by 7-10% every minute without defibrillation. If after 2 minutes, the rhythm remains the same, then another shock is delivered. Chest \ncompression and rescue breaths are resumed and 1 mg epinephrine is administered. \nConsideration is given for an advanced airway placement. If after 2 minutes the rhythm still remains the same, the first dose of amiodarone 300mg bolus is \ngiven. With the next cycle of CPR, a shock is delivered and 1 mg of epinephrine is given. And with the \ncycle of CPR after that, shock is delivered and the second dose of amiodarone- 150mg is given",

      "explanation": "Vasopressin was a part of the resuscitation protocol in the 2010 American Heart Association \n(AHA) cardiac arrest algorithm but it has been removed from the 2015 guidelines. Vasopressin causes intense peripheral vasoconstriction due to stimulation of V1 receptors in the \nendothelium but it causes a limited increase in myocardial contractility, myocardial and cerebral \noxygen consumption, and metabolic demands. Thus it doesn’t have much of a survival benefit. Epinephrine and amiodarone are the two main drugs approved by the AHA for resuscitation of a \npatient in cardiac arrest. The first dose of epinephrine,1 mg IV, is administered after the 2nd defibrillator shock is delivered \nand it is continued every 3-5 minutes. If this is not effective, 300 mg IV bolus dose of amiodarone can be given and another dose of 150 \nmg given if necessary",

Option C: Adrenaline converts fine fibrillation to coarse fibrillation which then responds well to \ndefibrillation. Option D: Adrenaline is available as a 1 mL injection containing 1 mg of adrenaline in 1:1000 \nconcentration. The dose used in cardiac arrest is 1mg of adrenaline every 3-5 minutes, usually \ngiven as 1ml in 1:1000 concentration or 10ml in 1:10,000 concentration (more preferred since in \ncardiac arrest peripheral circulation is absent; hence larger volume is required for the drug to \nreach the central circulation).",

The drugs \nshould be diluted in 10 ml of normal saline or distilled water for adults and 5 ml for children. When there is no intravenous access, the intraosseous route is preferred over the endotracheal \nroute because the optimal dose via the endotracheal route is not known.
