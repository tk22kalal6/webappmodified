      "correct_answer": "b",
      "explanation": "The procedure shown in the above picture is spinal anesthesia. The first case of spinal anesthesia in humans was performed by August Bier in 1898. He \nperformed spinal anesthesia using the local anesthetic cocaine. Spinal anesthesia involves the administration of a local anesthetic into the spinal subarachnoid \nspace to provide motor and sensory blockade. Another contribution by August Bier is 'Bier's block' \nor IVRA (intravenous regional anesthesia). John Lundy: coined the term balanced anesthesia. Carl Koller: proposed local anesthetic property of cocaine. Oliver Wendell: coined the term anesthesia.",
