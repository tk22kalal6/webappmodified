      "explanation": "Succinylcholine is a depolarizing muscle relaxant. 191 \nSold by @itachibot Option A: It produces both phase I and phase II block (at a higher dose). Option B: Succinylcholine can produce a rise in intracranial pressure as a result of increased \ncerebral blood flow due to muscle fasciculations. Option C: Precurarization is the administration of a small dose of a non-depolarizing \nneuromuscular blocking agent, a few minutes before Sch to minimize complications like \nfasciculations, post-operative myalgia, rise in intragastric pressure, and rise in ICP.",

      "explanation": "Suxamethonium (succinylcholine) is the shortest-acting muscle relaxant. It has a rapid-onset (30–60secs) and short duration of action (typically less than 10 min) due to \nrapid hydrolysis by butyrylcholinesterase (plasma cholinesterase or pseudocholinesterase).",

      "correct_answer": "d",
      "explanation": "Suxamethonium (also known as succinylcholine) produces both phases I and II blocks. Suxamethonium is a depolarizing muscle relaxant. Mechanism of depolarizing blockade: • Phase I block - continuous endplate depolarization and subsequent muscle relaxation. • Phase II block - seen with a single, large dose, repeated doses, or a continuous infusion which \ncan lead to desensitization of the receptors resulting in the prolonged neuromuscular blockade. Phase II block has features of a non-depolarizing blockade. But 'phase II' is specifically used for \ndepolarizing blockade by succinylcholine.",

      "explanation": "Fade is seen in the non-depolarising phase II block caused by depolarizing muscle relaxants. 192 \nSold by @itachibot Depolarising neuromuscular blockers result in prolonged depolarization with a brief period of \nfasciculations (repetitive excitation) followed by blocking of neuromuscular transmission and \nflaccid paralysis. This is termed as phase I block and cannot be reversed by neostigmine as the \nmembrane is in a depolarised state. The depolarised nerves are unresponsive to other stimuli during this period. As the concentration of the drug and time increases, the block may convert slowly to a \nnon-depolarising phase II block. Fade can be seen in this phase.

      "explanation": "The most likely reason which led to this scenario is phase II blockade produced by \nsuccinylcholine. Phase II block is clinically seen with the dose &gt;5 mg/kg. It is seen with a single large dose, \nrepeated doses, or a continuous infusion of Sch which can lead to desensitization of the receptors \nresulting in a prolonged neuromuscular blockade. Causes of prolonged apnea include: • Atypical/pseudocholinesterase deficiency - can result in apnea even with a normal dose of \nsuccinylcholine • Altered response of endplate to depolarizing relaxant (myasthenia gravis) • Accumulation of succinylcholine leading to phase II blockade Note: Although options A, B, and D can lead to prolonged apnea, in the above case scenario, the \npatient has received ~9 mg/kg of succinylcholine.

      "explanation": "Phase I depolarizing block is preceded by muscle fasciculation. Note: Cholinesterase inhibitors are not routinely used to reverse phase II blockade as certain \nindividuals have abnormal cholinesterase activity (due to genotypic variations).

      "correct_answer": "b",
      "explanation": "Calcium release from the sarcoplasmic reticulum is decreased by dantrolene. It is a direct-acting skeletal muscle relaxant that acts on the RyR1 (ryanodine receptor) calcium \nchannels in the sarcoplasmic reticulum of skeletal muscles and inhibits calcium-induced calcium \nrelease. It results in the uncoupling of membrane depolarization and muscle contraction. IV dantrolene is the drug of choice for malignant hyperthermia which is due to the persistent \nrelease of calcium from the sarcoplasmic reticulum.",
