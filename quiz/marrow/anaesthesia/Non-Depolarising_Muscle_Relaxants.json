      "correct_answer": "b",
      "explanation": "The curare group of drugs includes non-depolarizing neuromuscular blocking agents that act by \ncompetitively blocking the binding of acetylcholine to its receptors. This leads to a decrease in the effect of acetylcholine and thus, neuronal transmission to the \nmuscle does not occur.",

      "explanation": "Gantacurium is an ultra-short acting, rapid-onset, non-depolarizing muscle relaxant that \nundergoes non-enzymatic degradation. It belongs to the mixed-onium fumarate group. L-cysteine adduction results in the formation of a heterocyclic ring that cannot interact with the \nAch receptor in the post-junctional space.

It is metabolized by Hofmann elimination and non-specific ester hydrolysis. Hofmann elimination \nis a spontaneous non-enzymatic degradation of atracurium into laudanosine and \nmono-quaternary acrylate. Laudanosine has CNS stimulating properties and can result in \nprecipitation of seizures. Atracurium precipitates as a free acid if it is introduced into an intravenous line containing \nan alkaline solution such as thiopental. Thus, the 2 drugs are chemically incompatible.",

Clinical signs consistent with recovery are: • Sustained head lift for 5 seconds 214 \nSold by @itachibot • Sustained leg lift for 5 seconds • Sustained handgrip for 5 seconds • Sustained “tongue depressor test” • Maximum inspiratory pressure 40 to 50 cm H2O or greater",

      "correct_answer": "b",
      "explanation": "Neostigmine has no effect on potassium efflux. Neostigmine is an acetylcholine esterase inhibitor. Its primary mechanism of action is decreased \nbreakdown of acetylcholine at the motor endplate. Minor actions: • Increases the release of acetylcholine from motor endplates. • Direct depolarization of the postjunctional motor endplate. It is used for the reversal of neuromuscular blockade produced by non-depolarizing muscle \nrelaxants used during anesthesia. Note: Cobra venom consists of a neurotoxin that is responsible for respiratory paralysis which \nsimilar to that produced by a non-depolarizing muscle relaxant. A combination of artificial \nrespiration and neostigmine is useful in resuscitation.",
