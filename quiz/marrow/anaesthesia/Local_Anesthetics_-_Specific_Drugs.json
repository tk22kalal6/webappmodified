      "correct_answer": "d",
      "explanation": "The spray used by the pulmonologist is most likely a topical anesthetic. Bupivacaine is not used \nfor topical anesthesia. Lidocaine, tetracaine, benzocaine, and dibucaine are used for topical anesthesia. Lidocaine and tetracaine topical sprays: • Endotracheal intubation - blunt the cardiovascular responses • Esophagoscopy, bronchoscopy - mucosal analgesia. Lidocaine patch: postherpetic neuralgia. Benzocaine and cetacaine (a topical application spray containing benzocaine, tetracaine, and \nbutamben) had been used but a greater incidence of methemoglobinemia due to benzocaine has \ndiscouraged their use. 304 \nSold by @itachibot",

      "correct_answer": "a",
      "explanation": "Ropivacaine is S(-) enantiomer of bupivacaine, not R(+). Option B: The R(+) isomer of bupivacaine is responsible for cardiotoxicity. Ropivacaine is less \ncardiotoxic and has a higher safety profile than bupivacaine. Option C: Ropivacaine has a shorter duration of action and produces less motor block than \nbupivacaine (i.e. more motor sparing than bupivacaine). Ropivacaine is less potent than \nbupivacaine. Epidural ropivacaine is 40 % less potent than bupivacaine. Option D: Ropivacaine can be used for infiltration anesthesia and central neuraxial blocks (both \nspinal and epidural). Note: Levobupivacaine is another S(-) enantiomer of bupivacaine, with less cardiotoxicity. \nRopivacaine differs from levobupivacaine in the substitution of a propyl for the butyl group on the \npiperidine ring.",
