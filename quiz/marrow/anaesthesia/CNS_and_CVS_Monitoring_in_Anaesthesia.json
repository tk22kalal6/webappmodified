      "explanation": "45 \nSold by @itachibot Allen's Test is used to test the adequacy of collateral blood flow to the hand. It mandatory before \nradial artery cannulation and sometimes, before drawing blood for arterial blood gas (ABG) \nanalysis. Method: It is performed by occluding the radial and ulnar arteries and asking the patient to make a tight \nfist so as to exsanguinate the palm. Then, the patient is asked to open the hand and the occlusion over the ulnar artery is released. If \nthe palm remains pale for more than 6-10 seconds, it indicates reduced ulnar collateral flow.",

      "correct_answer": "b",
      "explanation": "0.5 ml of Heparin is not added to the syringe before taking blood. Very little heparin is needed in the sample to prevent clotting; 0.05 to 0.10 ml of a dilute \nsolution will help prevent coagulation of 1 ml of blood without affecting its pH. This is achieved by \ndrawing 0.5 ml into the syringe and flushing it out. The residue that remains adherent to the \nsyringe is sufficient for the procedure. Heparin must be added to the syringe as an anticoagulant. Because the pH of heparin is near 7.0, \nand the Po2 and Pco2 of the heparin solution are near room air values, excess heparin can alter \nABG measurements. After flushing the syringe with heparin, a sufficient amount usually remains \nin the dead space of the syringe and needle for anticoagulation without distortion of the ABG \ndetermination. Note: • Modified Allen's test positive indicates that the collateral blood flow is normal • Modified Allen's test negative indicates that the collateral blood flow is abnormal and an \nalternate site must be chosen. 46 \nSold by @itachibot Respiratory Monitoring in Anaesthesia",
