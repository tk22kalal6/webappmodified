The other options are contraindications to the use of thiopentone. Option B: Thiopentone induces aminolevulinic acid synthetase, which increases the formation of \nporphyrins. This precipitate porphyria attacks, especially acute intermittent porphyria or \nvariegate porphyria in susceptible individuals. Option C: Thiopentone should be avoided in hypovolemic or shock patients because of the \nsignificant reduction in cardiac output (69%) and arterial blood pressure due to vasodilation and \nvenous pooling. Option D: Thiopentone produces dose-related central respiratory depression, producing a \ncharacteristic ventilatory pattern called 'double apnea'.",

Intra-arterial injection of thiopentone can form crystals in the arterioles and capillaries, causing \nsevere vasoconstriction, thrombosis and even gangrene. The degree of gangrene corresponds to \nthe concentration of the drug.

      "explanation": "Propofol is an intravenous induction agent that can be addictive because of its hypnotic property \nand development of tolerance on prolonged use. The abuse potential is common among health care workers with reports of self-administration. \nThere is only a narrow therapeutic window between the hypnotic, euphoric effect of propofol and \nits lethal dose. When exceeded, it can cause airway obstruction, respiratory depression, hypoxia or \nan unstable hemodynamic response leading to death. Note: Ketamine also has the potential for abuse and addiction.",

Thiopentone constricts the cerebral vasculature, causing a decrease in cerebral blood flow, \ncerebral blood volume, and intracranial pressure. However, this vasoconstriction occurs only in \nnormal areas. The blood vessels in the ischemic area remain dilated due to ischemia-induced \nvasomotor paralysis and are unaffected by thiopentone. This leads to redistribution of blood flow \nfrom normal to ischemic areas in the brain. This is called the Robin Hood phenomenon.",
