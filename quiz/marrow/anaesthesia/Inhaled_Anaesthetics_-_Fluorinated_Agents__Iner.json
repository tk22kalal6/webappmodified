      "correct_answer": "b",
      "explanation": "Sevoflurane is the induction agent of choice among inhalational anesthetics. It is non-pungent and has low blood-gas solubility (0.65), allowing for smooth induction of \nanesthesia. Option A: Halothane has high blood gas solubility, leading to a slower induction of anesthesia. Option C: Desflurane and isoflurane are airway irritants, of which desflurane is the most pungent \ninhalational agent. Hence, they are not used for the induction of anesthesia as they can precipitate \nlaryngospasm. These agents are used only during the maintenance of anesthesia. Option D: N2O has a MAC value of 104%, which makes it the least potent inhaled anesthetic. It is \nalways used in combination with more potent volatile agents.",

Enflurane is the most epileptogenic inhalational anesthetic. It increases seizure activity, especially \nin the presence of cerebral injury and hypocapnia, and results in increasing the cerebral \nmetabolism manifold.

      "correct_answer": "c",
      "explanation": "Sevoflurane is the inhalational anesthetic agent of choice in liver cirrhosis. A cirrhotic liver has a compromised portal venous blood flow and hence it is essential to preserve \nthe hepatic arterial blood flow. Sevoflurane decreases portal vein blood flow but increases hepatic artery blood flow. Thus the \ntotal hepatic blood flow and oxygen delivery are better maintained. An alternative is isoflurane which may reduce hepatic arterial blood flow but maintains hepatic \noxygen supply.",

      "explanation": "Seizures have been associated with the use of sevoflurane in high concentrations, especially in the \npediatric population. Emergence from sevoflurane is associated with tonic-clonic movements suggestive of the seizure. \nHence sevoflurane must be used cautiously in patients with a known history of seizure.

Isoflurane has been associated with myocardial ischemic symptoms, particularly in scenarios \nwhere coronary perfusion pressure is compromised. It dilates normal coronary arteries, which can redirect blood flow away from areas supplied by \nstenotic or diseased vessels, worsening ischemia in those regions. This redistribution of blood flow \nmay contribute to hypotension, ST-segment changes, and reduced cardiac output. However, these \neffects are typically seen when hypotension occurs and can be mitigated by maintaining adequate \ncoronary perfusion pressure. 243 \nSold by @itachibot",

      "explanation": "Among the given options, isoflurane is best suited for neurosurgery. All of the inhalational anesthetics are cerebral vasodilators. The order of vasodilating potency is: halothane &gt; enflurane &gt; desflurane &gt; isoflurane &gt; sevoflurane. 247 \nSold by @itachibot Note: Due to its lesser vasodilating property, sevoflurane is preferred to isoflurane for \nneurosurgery. 248 \nSold by @itachibot Intravenous Anesthesia - Barbiturates, Benzodiazepines & Propofol",
