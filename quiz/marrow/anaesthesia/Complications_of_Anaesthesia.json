      "explanation": "Nitrous oxide is associated with postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV). Hence it is avoided \nin patients at high risk of PONV. PONV has an incidence of 20-30% in general surgical population and 70-80% in those with \npredisposing risk factors. Risk factors for PONV: • Patient-specific: Female gender, non-smoking status, history of motion sickness/PONV • Anesthetic-specific: Nitrous oxide, volatile anesthetics, opioids 407 \nSold by @itachibot • Surgery-specific: Increased duration of surgery, type of surgery Drugs used in the prophylaxis and treatment of PONV: • 5-HT 3 antagonists - ondansetron, palonosetron • Butyrophenones- droperidol • Dexamethasone • Transdermal scopolamine Note: Propofol has antiemetic property and thus reduces the risk of PONV.",

The most common cause of anaphylactic reactions during anesthesia is antibiotics (especially \npenicillin and cephalosporin), followed by neuromuscular blockers (rocuronium). Amino ester local anesthetics (procaine) exhibit allergic reactions due to the metabolite PABA. \nSulfa drugs like sulfonamide antibiotics, furosemide, hydrochlorothiazide, and captopril also \nexhibit allergy in surgical patients.",

      "explanation": "Post blood transfusion syphilis is most likely related to the use of platelet concentrate. The causative agent of syphilis, Treponema pallidum, cannot survive in storage at 10 to 16°C. So, \nit does not survive in most blood components except platelet concentrates, because platelets are \nstored at room temperature.",

      "correct_answer": "d",
      "explanation": "Irradiation of granulocytes before transfusion does not reduce acute hemolytic reaction as it is \ndue to attack on the transfused donor RBCs by recipient's antibodies and complements. Similarly, the risk of bacterial contamination of platelets and transfusion-related acute lung injury \n(TRALI) has not decreased with leukoreduction. Irradiation of granulocytes or use of leukoreduced blood components has several advantages over \nthe use of packed red blood cells: • Decreased risk of graft versus host disease-which is due to engraftment of donor lymphocytes \nfrom the transfused blood products leading to an immune reaction against recipient tissues • Reduces chances of febrile reactions • Decreases re-perfusion injury (myocardium; after heart by-pass) • Decreases transmission of cytomegalovirus",

All anesthetic agents should be cut off and the patient is given 100% oxygen. Bicarbonate at a dose of 1 to 4 mEq/kg IV can be used to treat metabolic acidosis.
