      "explanation": "Prior to direct laryngoscopy and intubation, the patient is placed in the sniffing position, which \nconsists of flexion at the lower cervical spine with extension at the atlanto-occipital joint. This is to ensure a line of sight from the mouth to the larynx so that intubation can be performed \nwith ease. Cervical flexion of 35 degrees is provided by elevating the patient's head by 7-9 cm (folded sheet \nunder the head). This aligns the pharyngeal and laryngeal axes. Atlanto-occipital extension is provided by the head tilt. This brings into alignment the visual axis \nof the mouth with that of pharyngeal and laryngeal axes. Adequacy of head elevation can be estimated by checking the horizontal alignment between \nexternal auditory meatus and sternal notch.",

      "explanation": "Rapid sequence intubation for a patient with a hiatus hernia should be facilitated by the use of a \nnon-depolarizing muscle relaxant such as rocuronium, to prevent an increase in the intragastric \npressure (IGP). Succinylcholine is usually the muscle relaxant of choice for RSI since it has a rapid onset and \nshort duration of action. However, regurgitation and aspiration of gastric contents are likely, due \nto fasciculations of the abdominal skeletal muscles. Hence, endotracheal intubation may be \nfacilitated with rocuronium before succinylcholine to decrease this risk. Generally, an IGP &gt; 28 cm H2O is required to overcome the competence of the \ngastroesophageal junction. However, when the normal oblique angle of entry of the esophagus \ninto the stomach is altered, the IGP required for regurgitation is much lesser.

      "explanation": "The image shown is of an armored tube (a.k.a. reinforced, flexo-metallic endotracheal tube). It is \nuseful in head and neck surgeries and when the patient is in a prone position. An armored tube is a flexible, spiral wound tube which is reinforced with the metal coil so as to \nminimize kinking. The metal coil is better made out in the second image. Other specialized endotracheal tubes include: • South oral Ring Adair Elwin: Nasal surgery • Micro laryngeal tubes: Laryngeal surgery • Double-lumen endotracheal tubes (Carlen, Robertshaw): Thoracic surgery Note: The tip of the armored endotracheal tube is 2 cm distal to the distal-most metal ring, and \nthis portion may not be visualized in radiography.",
