When a pediatric patient is in tachycardia, a 12-lead ECG is done to evaluate the rhythm and QRS \ncomplex duration. In addition, cardiopulmonary compromise is also assessed by checking for \nacutely altered mental status, signs of shock, and hypotension. Based on the QRS complex duration on the ECG, it can be: • Narrow (0.09 seconds) indicating a probable supraventricular tachycardia 150 \nSold by @itachibot • Wide (&gt;0.09 seconds) indicating a possible ventricular tachycardia Treatment of patient with probable supraventricular tachycardia: • Presence of cardiopulmonary compromise - adenosine • Absence of cardiopulmonary compromise - vagal maneuvers Treatment of patient with possible ventricular tachycardia: • Presence of cardiopulmonary compromise - synchronized cardioversion • Absence of cardiopulmonary compromise - adenosine, if the the rhythm is regular and QRS is \nmonomorphic 151 \nSold by @itachibot ACLS",
