      "options": {
        "a": "Nasal cannula",

        "c": "Nasal mask",
        "d": "Anaesthetic bag"
      },
      "correct_answer": "d",
      "explanation": "Anaesthetic bag or the bag-mask-valve system is a high flow fixed performance system - the \ndelivered FiO2 is not affected by changes in ventilatory level or breathing pattern of the patient \nand thus deliver accurate oxygen concentration. It is of two types: the self-inflating bags with a \nreservoir of 1.5 L and the non-self-inflating bags with a reservoir of 1, 2 or 3 L. The disadvantage is high cost and poor patient tolerability due to high flow. The other fixed \nperformance devices include venturi mask, air-entraining nebulizers, and high flow air oxygen \nsystems. The nasal cannula, non–rebreathing mask, and nasal mask are low flow variable performance \nsystems. Oxygen is delivered at a low, fixed flow which is only a portion of the inspired gas \nmixture. They are cheap with better patient tolerability. The disadvantage is that the FiO2 \ndelivered cannot be accurately predicted, so they are suitable for patients with stable breathing \npatterns.

        "c": "40%",
        "d": "10%"
      },
      "correct_answer": "c",
      "explanation": "The nasal cannula is a low flow variable performance oxygen delivery system that can achieve a \nmaximum inspired oxygen concentration of 40-50 % if flow rates are greater than 10L/ min for \nshort periods. Flow rates greater than 5 L/min are not tolerated because of the discomfort associated with this \nhigh flow entering the nasal cavity and also due to drying and crusting of the nasal mucosa. At flow rates of 3-4 L, it can provide an inspired oxygen concentration of 30-35%. In mouth-to-mouth resuscitation, the percentage of oxygen delivered is 16%.",

      "correct_answer": "a",
      "explanation": "178 \nSold by @itachibot A nasal cannula is a low flow variable performance oxygen delivery system. It is not suited for \npatients requiring high FiO2 or inspiratory oxygen flow rates greater than 40 L/min for which \ndevices like venturi mask, anaesthetic bag, air-entraining nebulizers, or high flow air oxygen \nsystems are preferred. Indications of a nasal cannula and other low-flow oxygen delivery systems include • Minute ventilation &lt; 8–10 L/min • Breathing frequencies &lt; 20 breaths/min • Tidal volumes (V T ) &lt; 0.8 L • Normal inspiratory flow (10–30 L/min).",

It is available in different colors, with the green valve venturi mask providing 60% FiO2.

      "question": "Question 5: An 18-year-old boy is rushed to the emergency department after having choked on a bone \nwhile eating. He is responsive but unable to speak. What is to be done next?",
      "options": {
        "a": "Bag and mask ventilation",

        "c": "Deliver 5 backslaps and 5 chest compressions",
        "d": "Perform Heimlich maneuver"
      },
      "correct_answer": "d",
      "explanation": "In a choking child (more than 1 year old) or an adult, the first step to be done is to perform \nHeimlich maneuver which involves delivering abdominal thrusts. The rescuer should stand or kneel behind the patient and wrap his arms around the patient’s \nwaist. A fist is made with one hand and using the other hand, the fist is driven into the patient’s \nabdomen with a rapid, forceful upward thrust so as to dislodge the foreign body. This is continued \nuntil the foreign body is expelled or if the patient becomes unresponsive. If the patient becomes unresponsive, immediately start CPR. In a choking infant who is responsive, 5 back slaps between the shoulder blades and 5 downward \nthrusts on the chest are given in order to dislodge the foreign body. If the patient becomes unresponsive, immediately start CPR. 180 \nSold by @itachibot",

      "question": "Question 6: In an intubated patient, after what duration of endotracheal intubation will you need to \nperform a tracheostomy?",
      "options": {
        "a": "2 hours",

        "c": "2 weeks",
        "d": "2 months"
      },
      "correct_answer": "c",
      "explanation": "Tracheostomy is performed in an intubated patient after 2-3 weeks. This is because if an orotracheal or nasotracheal tube is left in situ for more than 2-3 weeks, it \nresults in subglottic stenosis. Hence it is ideal to replace the endotracheal tube with a cuffed tracheostomy tube. If on intubation, it is perceived that the patient may require intubation for a period longer than 2 \nweeks, then tracheostomy can be performed soon after intubation. Tracheostomy has been found to reduce the incidence of pneumonia, the duration of mechanical \nventilation, and the length of stay in hospitals for patients with major head injuries.",

Brain death criteria can be applied only in the absence of: • Hypothermia • Hypotension • Uncorrected metabolic or endocrine abnormalities • Neuromuscular blockers • Drugs known to depress brain function. Generally accepted clinical criteria for brain death include the following: • Coma • Absent motor activity, including no decerebrate or decorticate posturing • Spinal cord reflexes may be preserved • Absent brainstem reflexes, including no pupillary, corneal, vestibulocochlear (caloric), or gag (or \ncough) reflexes • Absence of ventilatory effort, with the arterial CO2 tension &gt;60 mm Hg or 20 mm Hg above \nthe pretest level (positive apnea test) Confirmatory test findings (not mandatory but may assist in diagnosis) • Isoelectric electroencephalogram • Absence of brainstem auditory evoked potentials • Absence of cerebral perfusion as documented by angiographic, transcranial Doppler, or \nradioisotopic studies 183 \nSold by @itachibot Depolarising Muscle Relaxants",
