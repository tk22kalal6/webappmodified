This is due to altered sensitivity in the ion channels and receptors (nicotinic, \nacetylcholine, glutamate, and GABA). Recovery with a volatile anesthetic in geriatric patients may be prolonged because of an increased \nvolume of distribution(increased body fat) and decreased pulmonary gas exchange.

      "correct_answer": "d",
      "explanation": "Diffusion hypoxia is observed in anesthesia during recovery from nitrous oxide anesthesia. Due to low solubility (low blood gas partition coefficient), N2O diffuses from the blood to the \nalveoli and replaces the oxygen. This reduces alveolar O2 concentration, resulting in relative \nhypoxemia. Diffusion hypoxia can be avoided by using 100% oxygen for 10 minutes during recovery from \nanesthesia. 227 \nSold by @itachibot",

Nitrous oxide increases cerebral metabolic rate, cerebral oxygen consumption, and cerebral blood \nflow. Hence it is not preferred in neuro anesthesia as it increases intracranial pressure. Option A: N2O has a MAC value of 104%, which makes it the least potent inhaled anesthetic. \nHence it is always used in combination with the more potent volatile agents. Option B: N2O has low blood-gas solubility resulting in phenomena such as second gas effect, \nconcentration–effect, and diffusion hypoxia.

Hepatic artery vasoconstriction and increase in hepatic arterial resistance are seen with \nhalothane. Halothane also reduces hepatic oxygen delivery and hepatic venous oxygen saturation. This is \nbecause of the greater reduction in cardiac output caused by halothane than the other volatile \nagents. Hepatic arterial buffer response(HABF) is an autoregulatory mechanism in the liver. When portal \nblood flow decreases due to decreased cardiac output or hypovolemia, the hepatic arterial blood \nflow increases in order to maintain total hepatic blood flow. Halothane disrupts this regulatory \nmechanism, which is best preserved with sevoflurane or isoflurane. Desflurane and sevoflurane have the least significant effects on total hepatic blood flow and \noxygen delivery. Sevoflurane is considered equal to or better than isoflurane in preserving hepatic \narterial blood flow and hepatic oxygen delivery.",

      "explanation": "Uterine relaxation is maximum with halothane. Although halothane is not used in cases of PPH, it is the only anesthetic agent that can inhibit \nuterine contraction. Hence among the given inhaled drugs, Halothane is the appropriate answer for the given clinical \nscenario. Halogenated anesthetics like halothane have potent relaxant effects on the uterus. It is utilized for \nfacilitating intrauterine fetal manipulation. 231 \nSold by @itachibot However, its use during labor can prolong delivery and increase uterine bleeding. Options A and B: Ether and chloroform do not have any significant uterine relaxant action. Option C: Nitrous oxide also has uterine relaxant properties but is less than that of halogenated \ninhalational anesthetics.",

      "correct_answer": "d",
      "explanation": "The incidence of halothane hepatitis is 1 in 35,000, but it is very fatal with a mortality of 50-75%. It is an immune-mediated reaction due to antibodies against highly reactive trifluoroacetyl \nchloride which is a metabolite of halothane. Risk factors for halothane hepatitis: • Multiple exposures to halothane at short intervals • Middle-aged obese women • Familial predisposition to halothane The liver in halothane hepatitis shows centrilobular necrosis.",

      "explanation": "Nitrous oxide inhibits vitamin B12 dependent enzymes like thymidylate synthetase, which is \nnecessary for DNA synthesis – this is responsible for the megaloblastic bone marrow changes. Megaloblastic anemia is seen with nitrous oxide especially when exposure is greater than 2-6 \nhours (in healthy patients prolonged periods of exposure &gt; 12 hours is required whereas, in \ncritically ill patients, much shorter periods of exposure can lead to megaloblastic changes in the \nbone marrow). Side effects of nitrous oxide: • Bone marrow depression • Subacute combined degeneration of the cord • Teratogenicity • Peripheral neuropathy Contraindications of nitrous oxide: 232 \nSold by @itachibot • Venous or arterial air embolism • Pneumothorax • Acute intestinal obstruction with bowel distention • Intracranial air (pneumocephalus following dural closure or pneumoencephalography) • Pulmonary air cysts • Intraocular air bubbles • Tympanic membrane grafting 233 \nSold by @itachibot Inhaled Anaesthetics - Fluorinated Agents, Inert Agents and Therapeutic Gases",
