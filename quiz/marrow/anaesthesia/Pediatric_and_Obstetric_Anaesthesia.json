Pregnancy is considered to be a state of 'full stomach' and therefore rapid sequence induction is \npreferred when undergoing procedures under general anaesthesia. Succinylcholine is the preferred muscle relaxant in rapid sequence induction due to its following \nproperties: • Rapid onset (30-45 seconds) • The short duration of action (metabolized by pseudocholinesterase) • Highly ionized and poorly lipid-soluble (lower placental transfer to foetus). Rocuronium can be used as an alternative to succinylcholine. It is the non-depolarizing \nneuromuscular blocking agent of choice for rapid sequence induction. It has a rapid onset(&lt;60 390 \nSold by @itachibot seconds) and its duration of action can be terminated by the reversal agent sugammadex.

      "correct_answer": "d",
      "explanation": "Lumbar epidural is the most commonly used technique to produce labour analgesia because it can \nprovide analgesia during the first stage of labour and also provide anaesthesia during vaginal \ndelivery or cesarean section if necessary. For adequate pain relief, the sensory block of T10-L1 is required during the first stage of labour \nand S2-S4 is required during the second stage. The epidural catheter placed at L3-L4 or L4-L5 \ninterspace sufficiently provides T10–S5 neural blockade. Option A: Pudendal nerve block is given in the second stage of labor just before delivery of the \nbaby to provide analgesia to the vulva and anus . However, it has no effect on the pain of \ncontractions. It is also given before repair of episiotomy or perineal lacerations. Option B: Spinal anaesthesia for labour analgesia has the advantage of a rapid and reliable onset \nof the neural blockade, and it is technically easier to administer compared to epidural analgesia. \nHowever, repeated intrathecal injections may be required for a prolonged labour, thus increasing \nthe risk of post-dural puncture headache. Option C: Caudal epidural is largely abandoned to provide pain relief in obstetrics. It requires \nlarge volumes of a local anaesthetic to anaesthetize upper lumbar and lower thoracic dermatomes \nto provide adequate labour analgesia. Though rare, accidental puncture of the fetus is a \npossibility.",

Epidural epinephrine can provide vasoconstriction which would delay the vascular uptake of local \nanaesthetic and opioid. Additionally, it can activate  2-adrenergic receptors and thus produce \nanalgesia on its own. Epinephrine, used along with local anaesthetics at a concentration of 5 g/mL or 1:200,000 may \nbe associated with uterine artery vasoconstriction which can adversely affect the fetus and delay \nthe progress of labour. Hence epinephrine at this dose is used only for test dose (15 g/mL or 3 ml \nof 1:200,000).

      "explanation": "The clinical features and neck radiograph (steeple sign) are suggestive of laryngotracheobronchitis \n(croup) in the child and halothane is the preferred agent used for induction in this condition. 395 \nSold by @itachibot Normally sevoflurane and halothane are agents used for induction in children. But in a child with \nairway obstruction like croup (laryngotracheobronchitis), rapid induction is contraindicated. To perform laryngoscopy and tracheal intubation in such children, slow induction of anaesthesia \nis required before the child becomes sufficiently anaesthetized. Moreover, halothane has a slower \nexcretion than sevoflurane, which provides sufficient time for airway management. The therapeutic index of sevoflurane is higher than halothane (myocardial depression, \nsensitization of the myocardium to arrhythmias, halothane hepatitis) and hence is preferred for \nroutine cases. However in certain underdeveloped countries, due to its cost-effectiveness, \nhalothane is preferred.",

      "explanation": "Methohexitone has the potential to cause seizures, hence it is avoided in children with temporal \nlobe epilepsy. Intravenous administration of methohexitone can cause burning, hiccups, apnea, and \nextrapyramidal-like movements. Due to its potential to cause seizures, it is used to therapeutically \ninduce seizures in electroconvulsive therapy in adults. Option D: Ketamine is contraindicated in patients with increased intracranial tension and better \navoided in epileptic patients due to ketamine-induced myoclonic and seizure-like activity. Options A and C: Propofol and thiopentone have anti-convulsant property. Note: This is a controversial MCQ. Among the above options, methohexitone is the most specific \nanswer.",

      "correct_answer": "c",
      "explanation": "Fentanyl is the most commonly used opioid in infants and children due to its rapid onset and \nshort duration of action. Termination of its effects is due to rapid redistribution and elimination. It has the advantage of \nmaintaining cardiovascular stability while providing anaesthesia. But, fentanyl induced \nbradycardia may require treatment with atropine/glycopyrrolate since the cardiac output of \nneonates is determined by the heart rate. Option A: Morphine leads to greater respiratory depression in neonates due to slower clearance of \nmorphine. Option B: Meperidine / Pethidine is not used in children since long term or repeated \nadministration of the drug leads to seizures due to the accumulation of its \nmetabolite-normeperidine. Option D: Sufentanil is usually preferred for cardiac anaesthesia. 396 \nSold by @itachibot",

      "correct_answer": "c",
      "explanation": "The clinical scenario is suggestive of pyloric stenosis and the child should be pretreated with \natropine if suxamethonium is used during the surgery. For surgical repair in children with pyloric stenosis, either of the following two techniques can be \ndone: • Rapid-sequence induction - if suxamethonium (2mg/kg) is used, atropine (0.02 mg/kg) should be \ngiven because children are more susceptible than adults to bradycardia and sinus node arrest \nassociated with suxamethonium. • Awake intubation - preserves airway reflexes The classically described rapid sequence technique (preoxygenation, cricoid pressure, and \navoiding mask ventilation) is not appropriate for an infant with pyloric stenosis. Opton A: Aspiration of gastric contents is done by suctioning with a wide bore vented catheter \nbefore induction of anaesthesia to remove 98% of gastric contents. Option B: Cricoid pressure can distort the anatomy making laryngoscopy difficult, hence avoided. \nIf it is applied and there is no clear view of the larynx then the pressure should be relaxed. Option D: Infants rapidly desaturate compared to adults due to greater oxygen consumption and \nsmaller functional residual capacity. This means that gentle bag-mask ventilation is required prior \nto laryngoscopy to avoid hypoxemia and bradycardia.",

      },
      "correct_answer": "c",
      "explanation": "The preferred sedative premedication in children is midazolam. It is preferred as it has a shorter elimination half-life (2 hours) and has the advantage of \nproducing anterograde amnesia. It is water-soluble and hence painless on injection. It is usually \nadministered to children 10 to 12 months or older because of separation anxiety from parents. Other sedative premedications that are sometimes used include dexmedetomidine, clonidine, \ntemazepam and ketamine. Option A: Barbiturates are not commonly used for premedication in children since the availability \nof short-acting benzodiazepines. A major disadvantage is hyperalgesia, which can induce agitation \nin children with pain. Option B: Diazepam has a longer elimination half-life (18 hours) and immature liver function that \nwould prolong its action in young children. Option D: Propofol is the most useful sedative-hypnotic drug but is not approved for this use in \npediatric patients. Note- Ketamine is effective as a sedative, but it can increase oral secretion and can cause \nhallucinations during recovery. Hence oral ketamine is usually avoided, and when used, is \nadministered along with antisialogogue (atropine/glycopyrrolate) and a benzodiazepine (such as \nmidazolam). 397 \nSold by @itachibot",
