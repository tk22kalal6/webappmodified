Mapleson classified the semi-closed anesthetic breathing system according to • The position of the expiratory valve • The fresh gas flow inlet • Position/presence of the reservoir bag Mapleson's system includes Type A, B, C, D, E, and F. Mapleson circuit type D is the circuit of choice for controlled ventilation. Note: The Bain circuit is a coaxial version of the Mapleson D system that incorporates the fresh \ngas inlet tubing inside the breathing tube.

The ability to scavenge exhaled gases is also maximum with a closed system. Scavenging is the \nprocess of removal of waste anesthetic gases from both the anesthesia machine and the \nanesthetizing location (operation theatre). Thus minimizing operating room pollution. Components of the circle system: • CO2 absorber • fresh gas inlet • uni-directional valves (inspiratory and expiratory) • Breathing tubes (inspiratory and expiratory) • Y-connector • APL valve • Reservoir bag. The circle system allows for a uni-directional flow of anesthetic gases. Carbon dioxide absorber (eg soda-lime) allows rebreathing of anesthetic gases after the removal of \nexhaled carbon dioxide. This conserves anesthetic gases and thus reduces air pollution.",
