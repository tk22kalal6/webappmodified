        "d": "Inactivated, ligand-gated Na channel"
      },
      "correct_answer": "b",
      "explanation": "The main mechanism of action of local anesthetics is through inhibition of inactivated, \nvoltage-gated Na channel. Local anesthesia involves the abolition of local sensation through blockade of nerve impulses. Na channels exist in 3 states: • Resting (non-conducting) • Open (conducting) • Inactivated (non conducting) Local anesthetics have a greater affinity for the channel in the open or inactivated state than in the \nresting state. They bind to the Na channel from the inner aspect in cationic form. They bind to the  subunit of Na channel and inhibit the conformational changes associated with \nchannel opening, thereby preventing Na influx. When a considerable number of Na channels are \ninactivated, the action potential cannot be generated and impulse cannot be propagated.",

      },
      "correct_answer": "b",
      "explanation": "Local anesthetics block nerve conduction by decreasing the influx of sodium ions into the cells. \nNormally, sodium influx is followed by slight depolarization of the membrane. Local anesthetics in unionized form cross the cell membrane and are converted to ionized forms \ninside the cytoplasm the sodium channel blockade occurs. Resting/closed conformation of the \nsodium channels have relatively low affinity for local anesthetics.",

      "explanation": "The addition of sodium bicarbonate to local anesthetics does not reduce local anesthetic toxicity. All local anesthetics are weak bases, but commercially available solutions have an acidic pH in \norder to maximize the stability and shelf life. In acidic solutions, most of the drug will be \nin ionized form. It is only the uncharged (non-ionized) form that diffuses across the lipid barrier \nto the site of action. A basic solution (sodium bicarbonate) can be added to a local anesthetic solution immediately \nbefore injection to raise the pH. This is termed 'alkalinization' or 'buffering'. Alkalinization \nincreases the proportion of non-ionized drug resulting in more rapid drug diffusion. Advantages of alkalinization: • Faster onset of action • Reduced pain/stinging on subcutaneous injection • Improved quality of the block 1mL 8.4% sodium bicarbonate is added to 10 mL of local anesthetic solution.

      "explanation": "The manifestations of shellfish poisoning are due to the action of the poison on the outer pore of \nthe voltage-gated sodium channel. Shellfish poisoning is due to the neurotoxin saxitoxin and puffer fish poisoning is due to \ntetrodotoxin. Although these toxins are chemically distinct, they are exceedingly potent and have \nsimilar mechanisms of action. While local anesthetics inhibit sodium channel activity by binding to the inner pore (from \nintracellular side), these toxins bind to the outer pore of the channel. As a result, the action \npotential is blocked. Unlike local anesthetics, these neurotoxins are very specific to neuronal Na channels, hence \ncardiac and neurological side effects are low.
