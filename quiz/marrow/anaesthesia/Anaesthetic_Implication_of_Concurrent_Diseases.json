      "correct_answer": "c",
      "explanation": "Ketamine is avoided in a hypertensive patient as it has intrinsic sympathomimetic properties and \nhence can aggravate hypertension. Ketamine increases arterial blood pressure, heart rate, and cardiac output. This is due to central \nstimulation of the sympathetic nervous system and inhibition of the reuptake of norepinephrine. \nAnd hence it should be cautiously used in patients with uncontrolled hypertension, coronary \nartery disease, congestive heart failure and arterial aneurysms. Its stimulatory effects may be beneficial to patients with acute shock. All other intravenous \ninduction agents like propofol, thiopentone and etomidate produce a fall in blood pressure.",

      },
      "correct_answer": "d",
      "explanation": "Ketamine is the induction agent of choice in this patient who is likely suffering from tetralogy of \nFallot because it maintains or increases systemic vascular resistance and increases cardiac output. Tetralogy of Fallot is characterized by sub pulmonic stenosis, right ventricular hypertrophy, \nventricular septal defect and overriding of the aorta. This results in a right to left shunt through 369 \nSold by @itachibot the ventricular septal defect and consequent cyanosis. The commonest symptoms are dyspnea on exertion and exercise intolerance and develop blue \nskin (cyanosis) when agitated and are known as tet spells. The patients assume a sitting posture \n(squatting) or knee-chest position as soon as they get dyspneic, which leads to temporary \nsymptomatic relief. Ketamine does not aggravate the right to left shunt seen in such cases. It also does not increase \npulmonary vascular resistance in children as compared to adults and is hence safe to administer \nin children. Ketamine is the agent of choice in all cyanotic congenital heart diseases.",

      "correct_answer": "b",
      "explanation": "Wide fixed split S2 is suggestive of atrial septal defect (ASD) and sevoflurane is the inhalational \nagent of choice for induction in a child undergoing cardiac surgery. Halothane and sevoflurane are non-pungent and hence can be used for induction in pediatric \npatients. Sevoflurane is not associated with significant myocardial depression as is seen with \nhalothane. Hence, sevoflurane is preferred over halothane especially in all cardiovascular \nsurgeries in the paediatric age group. Following induction, isoflurane and sevoflurane are the most commonly used inhalation agents \nfor maintenance.",

      },
      "correct_answer": "a",
      "explanation": "General anaesthesia is preferred in patients with severe aortic stenosis. Spinal and epidural anaesthesia are relatively contraindicated. This is because regional \nanaesthesia produces profound hypotension which can lead to a fall in preload, afterload or both. Most general anaesthetics especially the volatile agents also cause vasodilation and hypotension \nwhich can be treated with escalating doses of vasopressors like phenylephrine. Mild to moderate aortic stenosis are not contraindications to regional anaesthesia. In such \nsituations, epidural anaesthesia is preferred over spinal because of its slower onset of hypotension \nwhich can be adequately corrected.",

        "d": "The surgeon has no role in the management of VAE"
      },
      "correct_answer": "b",
      "explanation": "The correct statement regarding venous air embolism (VAE) is, a decrease in oxygen saturation \nwill not always be seen, even with larger emboli. VAE can occur when the pressure within an open vein is subatmospheric. It can occur in any \nposition or procedure, whenever the wound is above the level of the heart. The incidence of \nvenous air embolism is greater during sitting craniotomies than in craniotomies in any other \nposition. Option A: Physiological monitors (heart rate, blood pressure, oxygen saturation, and end-tidal \ncarbon dioxide) have poor sensitivity and specificity and the clinical signs are manifested \nlate. Transesophageal echocardiogram (TEE) is the most sensitive method to monitor and can \ndetect up to 0.02ml/kg of air embolism. Option C: Patients with a right to left shunt are susceptible to paradoxical air emboli which can \nresult in a stroke or coronary occlusion. Option D: The surgeon should be notified immediately so that he or she can flood the surgical \nfield with saline or pack it with wet gauzes and apply bone wax to the skull edges until the entry \nsite is identified and occluded.",

      "explanation": "Succinylcholine, atracurium and cis-atracurium can be used in this patient who has a renal failure \nwith elevated serum creatinine(normal value- 0.8–1.3 mg/dL in men and 0.6–1 mg/dL in women). Succinylcholine can be safely administered to patients with diminished or absent kidney function \nprovided serum potassium levels are normal. If the serum potassium is increased, then a \nnon-depolarizing muscle relaxant like atracurium or cisatracurium which is non-dependent on \nrenal excretion is to be used. Atracurium or cisatracurium undergo Hofmann elimination which is \nnon-enzymatic spontaneous degradation. Pancuronium is almost entirely dependent on the kidney for excretion (60–90%). Pancuronium \nhas a prolonged elimination half-life in renal failure patients and thus should be used very \ncautiously. 40-60% of d-tubocurarine is excreted via the kidney and so prolonged effects are seen with renal \ninsufficiency 371 \nSold by @itachibot",

      "correct_answer": "b",
      "explanation": "Spinal anaesthesia is the preferred choice of anaesthetic for the TURP procedure. Regional anaesthesia is preferred over general anaesthesia in TURP due to the following reasons: • Less likely to mask the symptoms of TURP syndrome • Helps assess patients mental status as an alteration in mental status is an early sign of TURP • A lesser amount of operative blood loss and lesser risk of DVT. • Less likely to mask symptoms of bladder perforation like nausea, abdominal pain, dyspnea, \nshoulder pain, and hiccups. • Decreased need for analgesics in the immediate post-operative period. Spinal anaesthesia is preferred over epidural anaesthesia due to: • Easier to perform in elderly patients. • Duration of surgery is not usually long, so an epidural is not required. • Epidural anaesthesia may incompletely block the sacral nerve roots which can be avoided with \nspinal anaesthesia. Caudal anaesthesia may be used in high-risk patients undergoing laser prostatectomy as it \nprovides the advantage of hemodynamic stability. Local infiltration does not provide sufficient \noperative analgesia as spinal anaesthesia.",

Remifentanil is hydrolysed by plasma and tissue esterases and so its metabolism is independent of \nhepatic and renal function- no dose adjustment is required and is safe in liver failure patients and \nrenal failure patients. Because of this hydrolysis, it has a high clearance and is eliminated rapidly with a quick recovery ( \nhalf-life less than 10 minutes) and thus is preferred in elderly patients.",

      "explanation": "Muscle relaxants are avoided during a procedure of parotidectomy. The most common surgery for pleomorphic adenoma is superficial parotidectomy with facial \nnerve dissection. It is essential to preserve the facial nerve and hence, nerve stimulators are used \nduring the surgery to identify the facial nerve and its branches. This cannot be possible if muscle \nrelaxation is present.",

      "explanation": "Oxymetazoline is the preferred topical vasoconstrictor in ENT surgeries due to the safety profile \nand easy availability of the drug. 0.05% solution is administered as 3 nasal sprays in each nostril before any nasal procedure. It \nshould be avoided in patients who are on monoamine oxidase inhibitors as the interaction can \nresult in high blood pressure. Option B: Phenylephrine is an  -adrenergic agonist topical vasoconstrictor. It can cause severe \nhypertension and blood pressure monitoring is required. Option C: Cocaine has cardiovascular effects- it is sympathomimetic and when administered at a \nconcentration of 4%, it inhibits the reuptake of norepinephrine at sympathetic nerve terminals \nthus making it unsafe in patients with coronary artery disease or those on monoamine oxidase \ninhibitors. Option A: Lidocaine as such does not have vasoconstrictor properties but may be used with \nphenylephrine.",

      "correct_answer": "b",
      "explanation": "Continuous epidural anesthesia is the first choice for most patients with preeclampsia during \nlabor, vaginal delivery, and cesarean section. Pre-eclampsia patients have a risk of severe airway edema, which makes intubation difficult. Thus \ncontinuous epidural anesthesia is advantageous as it avoids the need for intubation. Besides, \ncontinuous epidural anesthesia can improve uteroplacental perfusion and also decrease \ncatecholamine secretion. But one major prerequisite for regional anesthesia in preeclamptic patients is normal platelet \ncount and normal coagulation. Coagulopathy is a contraindication for regional anesthesia. Minimal platelet count for regional anesthesia is 100,000/L, but some cases can be taken up with \na platelet count as low as 70,000/L. General anesthesia is indicated in patients with coagulopathy and in severe pre-eclampsia with \ncomplications. Spinal anesthesia can be given in mild pre-eclampsia but hypotension associated with spinal \nanesthesia limits its use in moderate to severe pre-eclampsia. Since the severity of pre-eclampsia or the type of delivery (vaginal or cesarean) is not mentioned, \nepidural anesthesia has an advantage over other techniques for above-mentioned reasons. Hence \nthe best option here would be epidural anesthesia.",
