Baralyme is less efficient than soda-lime as its absorptive capacity is 9-18L of CO2/100 g while of \nsoda lime is 23L of CO2/100 g. Baralyme with the composition of calcium hydroxide and barium hydroxide (activator) is less \ncaustic than soda lime. It gives more reliable performance in a dry environment.

      "explanation": "The image shows a specialized vapouriser Tec 6. Because of high vapor pressure (669 mmHg at \n20°C) and low boiling point (22.8°C ~ room temperature), Desflurane requires this \nspecialized vaporizer for its delivery. Anesthetic gas with the highest vapor pressure is Desflurane. Other salient features of Desflurane: • High saturated vapor pressure which is 3-4 times the other agents • Low boiling point • Low blood-gas solubility (0.42) resulting in rapid uptake and recovery • High MAC value of 6, indicating low potency • Requires specialized vapouriser such as Tec 6 • Color coding of Desflurane - Blue 133 \nSold by @itachibot • Undergoes minimal metabolism • Degraded into CO by the desiccated CO2 absorbent",

The reservoir bag serves as a reservoir for inhaled excess fresh gas and helps to generate positive \npressure ventilation. It is most commonly placed between the expiratory unidirectional valve and the CO2 absorber. The minimum allowed pressure is 30 cm H2O. Anesthesia workstation",

      "correct_answer": "",
      "explanation": "Heat and moisture exchanger (HME) is a passive humidifier, not active. The natural humidification and conservation of heat by the upper respiratory tract is lost or \nbypassed after tracheal intubation or tracheostomy. HME acts as an artificial nose, which traps \nthe exhaled water vapor and heat passively by its hygroscopic material, and thus conserves heat \nand adds moisture to the inhaled gases. Active humidifiers act by allowing air passage inside a heated water reservoir. These devices are \nplaced in the inspiratory limb of the ventilator circuit, proximal to the ventilator. After the air is \nloaded with water vapor in the reservoir, it travels along the inspiratory limb to the patient’s \nairway. Some humidifiers also serve as filters to trap bacteria/viruses and thus prevent the transmission of \nmicrobes from the patient to the machine and hence to other patients. 134 \nSold by @itachibot The disadvantage with the humidifier is that excess saturation can lead to blockage of the circuit. Shown above is an HME filter impregnated with a hygroscopic material. Shown above is the placement of HME filter in the breathing circuit.",
