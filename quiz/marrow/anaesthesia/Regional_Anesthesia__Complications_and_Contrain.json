      "question": "Question 1: A 65-year-old lady with a history of motion sickness underwent a knee replacement under \nspinal anesthesia. After the procedure, she complains she is feeling nauseous. Which of the \nfollowing is false about post-anesthetic nausea and vomiting associated?",
      "options": {
        "a": "History of motion sickness is a risk factor",
        "b": "Elderly age groups are at lesser risk",
        "c": "Female patients are at higher risk",
        "d": "Intrathecal morphine administration has the least incidence"
      },
      "correct_answer": "d",
      "explanation": "Intrathecal morphine has a higher risk and incidence of nausea and vomiting among opioids as \ncompared to fentanyl/sufentanil. This is because hydrophilic opioids (morphine) remain in CSF for a prolonged duration than \nlipophilic opioids (fentanyl) and sensitize the central chemoreceptor trigger zone. The Apfel score is used to predict the risk of developing postoperative nausea and vomiting \n(PONV). According to this, risk factors are: • Post-operative use of opioids • Non-smoker • Female gender • History of postoperative nausea, vomiting, or motion sickness Additional risk factors are the use of nitrous oxide as an inhalational anesthetic agent and the \nduration of anesthesia. Ondansetron with or without dexamethasone is used in the management of this condition. The \nuse of propofol in balanced or total IV anesthesia (TIVA) significantly reduces the incidence of \nPONV.",

      "question": "Question 2: A patient was scheduled to undergo a vaginal hysterectomy procedure under epidural \nanaesthesia. 5 minutes after the epidural block was given, the patient started shivering. \nWhich of the following is false regarding post-neuraxial shivering?",
      "options": {

        "d": "I.V. meperidine is used for treatment"
      },
      "correct_answer": "b",
      "explanation": "Post-neuraxial shivering is more common with epidural than spinal anaesthesia. The possible reasons include the use of a large volume of cold epidural injectate as compared to \na small volume of spinal drug and the inability to shiver with spinal anaesthesia because of the \nprofound motor block as compared with epidural techniques. Post-neuraxial shivering: • The incidence of post-neuraxial shivering is more than 40% (~55%) • The addition of neuraxial opioids (fentanyl, pethidine) reduces the likelihood of shivering • Prewarming the patient with a forced-air warmer and avoiding the administration of cold \nepidural and intravenous fluids helps to prevent shivering 339 \nSold by @itachibot • It has no relation to malignant hyperthermia • Intravenous meperidine and tramadol are used in the treatment",

      "correct_answer": "b",
      "explanation": "The most common cause of apnea following neuraxial blockade is hypotension leading to \nhypoperfusion of the brain stem respiratory centers. Diaphragmatic paralysis would require the height of the block up to the cervical level (phrenic \nnerve), which is very rare. However, it can occur in the setting of high spinal up to the cervical \nlevel and total spinal anesthesia. Blockade of the intercostal and abdominal muscles during neuraxial anesthesia is adequately \ncompensated by an unaltered function of the diaphragm and other accessory respiratory muscles. Systemic toxicity of the local anesthetic would mainly affect the central nervous system and \ncardiovascular system.",

Risk factors for spinal-anesthesia-induced hypotension: • Peak block height greater than or equal to T5 • Age older than or equal to 40 years • Baseline systolic blood pressure less than 120 mm Hg • Combined spinal and general anesthesia • Spinal puncture at or above the L2-L3 interspace Clinical features: • SBP &lt; 90 mmHg • Nausea precedes hypotension (first symptom to appear) • Apnea due to medullary hypoperfusion • Bradycardia Treatment: • Rapid administration of intravenous fluids • Head-down position (only after local anesthesia is fixed (~20 minutes for bupivacaine), else, \nhyperbaric solution can ascend and lead to high spinal) • Intravenous vasopressors (ephedrine, phenylephrine) 340 \nSold by @itachibot • Bradycardia is treated with atropine",
