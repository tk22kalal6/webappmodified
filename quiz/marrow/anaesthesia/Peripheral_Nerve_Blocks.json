The local \nanaesthetic is injected into the interscalene groove present behind the sternocleidomastoid at the \nlevel of cricoid cartilage (C6 vertebral level). This is a brachial plexus block performed at the trunk level.

So, \ninterscalene block provides surgical anesthesia for procedures of the shoulder and upper arm. Ulnar nerve (C8, T1) from inferior trunk may be missed. Hence, this block is not used for \nprocedures of the forearm and hand.",

      "correct_answer": "b",
      "explanation": "The most common complication of interscalene block, seen in 100% of patients, is diaphragmatic \nhemiparesis due to ipsilateral phrenic nerve blockade. This can result in dyspnea, hypoxia, and hypercapnea, especially if the patient has compromised \nlung function or preexisting contralateral phrenic nerve paralysis. Other complications of interscalene block are: • Horner's syndrome – ptosis, miosis, anhydrosis. Due to involvement of the sympathetic nerves \nto the cervicothoracic ganglion. • Recurrent laryngeal nerve palsy • Vagus nerve involvement • Pneumothorax • Bezold Jarisch reflex • Accidental vertebral artery injection (immediate seizure is seen) • Accidental spinal or epidural injection",

This results in hemidiaphragmatic paresis which is self-limited and resolves as the block wears \noff. Complications &amp; side-effects of supraclavicular block : • Hemidiaphragmatic paresis - due to phrenic nerve palsy • Pneumothorax - highest when compared to other brachial plexus blocks • Horners syndrome - from a block of the stellate ganglion • Hoarseness - due to recurrent laryngeal nerve palsy and/or cervical sympathetic block Note : Pneumothorax is the most dangerous complication of the supraclavicular block but it is not the \nmost common.

Indication: Pain arising from the abdominal viscera, particularly intra-abdominal cancers (Eg. \npancreatic cancer).
