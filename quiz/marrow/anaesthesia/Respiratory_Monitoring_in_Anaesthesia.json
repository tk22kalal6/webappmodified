      "explanation": "Radial artery cannulation is an invasive method of blood pressure monitoring and cannot be used \nfor perioperative respiratory monitoring. Respiratory monitoring involves the use of: • Capnography • Pulse oximeter • Anaesthetic gas analysis (oxygen analysis, piezo electric analysis) • Spirometry • Impedance pneumography is a method of monitoring apnea",

      "correct_answer": "a",
      "explanation": "The given image depicts a pulse oximeter. Pulse oximetry is used for monitoring pulse rate and \noxygen saturation of a patient. A small sensor is placed on the finger, toe, earlobe, or another convenient place. The relative \nabsorption of light by oxyhemoglobin (HbO2) and deoxyhemoglobin is assessed by measuring the \namount of red and infrared light emerging from tissues traversed by light rays and processed by \nthe device, producing an oxygen saturation level. Pulse oximetry does not measure the absolute content or the partial pressures of oxygen or carbon \ndioxide. A pulse oximeter is not always reliable as it reads: • Falsely high - carboxyhemoglobinemia 54 \nSold by @itachibot • Falsely low - severe anemia, low cardiac output states, hypovolemia, increased systemic vascular \nresistance • 80% to 85%, irrespective of the arterial oxygen saturation - methemoglobinemia",

      },
      "correct_answer": "b",
      "explanation": "Carbon monoxide poisoning is associated with a falsely high O2 saturation and least likely to show \nlow oxygen saturation values. • Oxyhemoglobin (HbO2) absorbs more infrared light (940 nm) • Deoxyhemoglobin absorbs more red light (660 nm) • Carboxyhemoglobin (COHb) and HbO2 absorption spectrum is similar • Thus in patients with carbon monoxide poisoning, a falsely high SpO2 of 95% is seen \nirrespective of the actual SpO2 value. Severe anemia, low cardiac output states, hypovolemia, and increased systemic vascular resistance \nare associated with falsely low oxygen saturation values. With normal SaO2, anemia has little effect on SpO2. However, in the presence of hypoxia, SpO2 \nreadings underestimate SaO2 in anemic patients.",

      "explanation": "End-tidal CO2 measured by capnography is the surest sign of tracheal intubation. It also assesses the adequacy of ventilation in the perioperative period. It can rule out oesophagal \nintubation where initially carbon dioxide may be detected due to swallowed air but later on \nceases. It cannot reliably rule out endobronchial intubation, which is indicated by a sudden rise in peak \ninspiratory pressure. 55 \nSold by @itachibot Option C: Physical examination methods such as auscultation of chest and epigastrium, \nvisualization of thoracic movement, and fogging in the tube are not sufficiently reliable to confirm \nendotracheal tube placement.

      },
      "correct_answer": "d",
      "explanation": "Capnography is used to measure the amount of expired carbon dioxide (end tidal CO2). It is used to confirm tracheal intubation and to assess the adequacy of ventilation in the \nperioperative period. Arterial carbon dioxide level (PaCO2) is accurately measured using arterial blood gas analysis. The \ngradient between PaCO2 and EtCO2 (normally 2–5 mm Hg) reflects alveolar dead space (alveoli \nthat are ventilated but not perfused). Although EtCO2 reflects arterial carbon dioxide level (PaCO2), any significant reduction in lung \nperfusion (eg, air embolism, decreased cardiac output) increases alveolar dead space, thus \nincreasing the gradient between PaCO2 and EtCO2. Hence D is the best answer.",

      "correct_answer": "d",
      "explanation": "In a capnographic waveform, the plateau phase corresponds to alveolar air. The normal waveform has four different phases: Phase I: Inspiratory baseline, represents the CO2-free gas from the airways (anatomical and \napparatus dead space). Phase II: Expiratory upstroke, mixing of dead space gas with alveolar gas. Phase III: Alveolar plateau, represents CO2-rich gas from the alveoli. The last of the alveolar gas is \nsampled to measure ETCO2. Phase 0: Inspiratory downstroke and the beginning of inspiration. Alpha angle: The transition from phase II to III. 56 \nSold by @itachibot The alpha angle can be used to assess the ventilation/perfusion of the lung. V/Q mismatches will \nhave an alpha angle greater than 90 degrees. Beta angle: The transition from phase III to 0. The beta angle can be used to assess rebreathing. If rebreathing occurs, the angle is greater than \n90 degrees.",
