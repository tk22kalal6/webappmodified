      "explanation": "In adults, the spinal cord ends at the level of lower border of L1 vertebra. Proximally, the spinal cord is continuous with the brain stem. Distally, it terminates in the conus \nmedullaris as the filum terminale (fibrous extension) and the cauda equina (neural extension). The lumbar puncture during spinal anesthesia (a.k.a. sub-arachnoid block, intra-thecal block) is \ndone below the level of L1 in adults (L2-3, L3-4, L4-5 interspace), to avoid potential needle trauma \nto the spinal cord.",

      "correct_answer": "d",
      "explanation": "Spinal anesthesia (subarachnoid block, intrathecal block) involves the administration of local \nanesthetic between the pia and arachnoid mater. In spinal anesthesia, the local anesthetic is injected into CSF, which bathes the nerve root. \nHence, a relatively small dose and volume of local anesthetic is sufficient to achieve dense sensory \nand motor blockade. Epidural anesthesia involves local anesthetic administration between the dura and ligamentum \nflavum. Subdural injection, seen in a failed spinal anesthesia, is between dura and arachnoid. 323 \nSold by @itachibot",

Option A: Advanced age is associated with increased block height, due to decreased CSF volume Option B: CSF volume is inversely related to the block level.

      "correct_answer": "b",
      "explanation": "The gender of the patient is the factor that least affects the height of the neuraxial block, among \nthe options given. Theoretically, the density of CSF is lower in women than in men. Although this may affect relative \nbaricity of local anaesthetics, the clinical variation in the spread is probably unimportant. Hence, \nthis is the best answer to choose from the above options. Option A: Higher anaesthetic levels are achieved in the elderly for a given dosage of spinal \nanaesthetic. Option C: Increased intraabdominal pressure or conditions that cause engorgement of the \nepidural veins, decrease CSF volume and thus increase block height. This includes conditions such \nas pregnancy, ascites, and large abdominal tumors. Option D: Within the range of “normal-sized” adults, patient height does not seem to affect the \nspread of spinal anaesthesia. But, extremes of height can affect the block height. 324 \nSold by @itachibot",

      "explanation": "To prevent hemodynamic disturbances, we must prevent the migration of the spinal block to \nupper thoracic segments. In the sitting position, this can be achieved by using a hyperbaric \nsolution like bupivacaine with glucose. Baricity of local anesthetics refers to the specific gravity of the solution with respect to that of \nCSF. A hyperbaric solution (addition of glucose) of local anesthetic is denser (heavier) than CSF, a \nhypobaric solution (addition of sterile water or fentanyl) is lighter than CSF and isobaric solution \n(plain or 1:1 CSF) has density same as that of CSF. Hyperbaric solution tends to move to the dependent area of the spine. While a hypobaric solution \nmoves to the non-dependent area. An isobaric solution remains at the level of injection. With the patient in a head-down position, a hyperbaric solution spreads cephalad, and a \nhypobaric solution moves caudally. In clinical practice, hyperbaric solutions are most commonly used during spinal anesthesia. A \nhypobaric solution is only used in prone jackknife position to specifically block the operative site \naround perineum during certain anorectal surgeries. 329 \nSold by @itachibot",

Sacral hiatus is formed by the unfused S4 and S5 laminae and is \ncovered by the sacrococcygeal ligament. The lines joining the posterior superior iliac spines and sacral hiatus make an equilateral triangle. \nThe sacral hiatus is felt as a groove or notch above the coccyx and between two bony prominences, \nthe sacral cornua. It is better appreciated in children than in adults and hence it is a common regional technique \namong pediatric patients. 331 \nSold by @itachibot Regional Anesthesia: Complications and Contraindications",
