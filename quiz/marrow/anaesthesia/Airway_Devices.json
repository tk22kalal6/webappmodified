      "explanation": "Bag and mask ventilation can be performed in patients with difficult airway. Bag and mask ventilation serves as a rescue technique to provide oxygenation and ventilation in \npatients with difficult airway until tracheal intubation is achieved. Contraindications of bag and mask ventilation: Patients at greater risk of aspiration such as patients with diaphragmatic hernia and those \nundergoing rapid sequence induction and intubation. This is because air can enter the stomach \nleading to raised intragastric pressure which increases the risk of aspiration. Mask ventilation should also be performed with caution in patients with severe facial trauma and \nin patients in whom head and neck manipulation must be avoided (e.g., those with an unstable \ncervical spine fracture).",

The landmarks used for \nmeasuring the appropriate size of this device are the corner of the mouth and the angle of \nthe mandible or tragus. 67 \nSold by @itachibot An oropharyngeal airway is an airway adjunct which keeps the tongue from falling back onto the \nposterior pharynx. It is essential to choose the correct size since inappropriately sized ones may aggravate airway \nobstruction. These airways should not be used in conscious patients as they may come into contact with the \nepiglottis and base of tongue. This can cause coughing, retching or laryngospasm if the pharyngeal \nand laryngeal reflexes are not blunted with local anaesthetic. Note: Nasopharyngeal airway size is chosen by measuring the distance between the tip of the nose \nand tragus of the ear. These airways, when well lubricated and inserted with proper technique, \ncan be used in conscious patients to secure an airway.",

      "explanation": "The image shows nasopharyngeal airway and its insertion. The true statement is that it is used to \nprevent falling back of tongue post-extubation especially in obese patients. Nasopharyngeal airways are less stimulating than oropharyngeal airways as it bypasses the gag \nreflex. Thus, it can be used in conscious patients as well. It does not prevent tongue bite unlike the oropharyngeal airway which has a bite block. It can \nprevent falling back of the tongue in patients with seizures.

      "explanation": "The image shown above is the technique of insertion of laryngeal mask airway. Laryngeal mask airway (LMA) is a supraglottic airway device that is positioned in the \nhypopharynx. Classic Laryngeal Mask Airway Supraglottic airway devices are used with both spontaneously and ventilated patients during \nanesthesia. LMA has advantages of being used in many settings, including the operating room (alternate route \nof ventilation), the emergency department (difficult intubation), and out-of-hospital care \n(paramedics). This is because it is easy to use, quick to place even for the inexperienced provider and has a very \nhigh success rate. The technique of insertion: • The deflated cuff of LMA is lubricated and inserted blindly into the hypopharynx so that, once \ninflated, the cuff forms a low-pressure seal around the entrance to the larynx. • Correct placement of the tube is confirmed by giving gentle positive pressure ventilation while \nchecking for chest rise and ETCO2 using capnography. 69 \nSold by @itachibot Note: Oropharyngeal airway: inserted in the patient’s mouth with concavity towards hard palate. As the \nairway is inserted it is rotated 180 degrees (concavity towards the tongue) until the flange comes \nto rest on the patient’s lips. Nasopharyngeal airway: inserted through the nostril (after lubrication) along the natural \ncurvature of the floor of the nasal cavity with the bevel pointing towards the septum. Once the \ndevice is inserted the flange should rest on the nostril opening. Endotracheal tube: inserted infraglottically after visualising the vocal cords with direct \nlaryngoscopy.",
