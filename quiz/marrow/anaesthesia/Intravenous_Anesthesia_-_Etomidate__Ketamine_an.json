      "correct_answer": "a",
      "explanation": "Ketamine does not elicit pain on injection, instead produces profound analgesia. Propofol is formulated as a lipid emulsion, which causes pain on injection. A new aqueous \nprodrug, fospropofol is associated with less pain on injection. Etomidate, although it causes pain on injection, the lipid formulation of etomidate is associated \nwith a much less frequent incidence of pain. Thiopentone at a concentration greater than 2.5% can produce pain on injection and venous \nthrombosis.",

      "explanation": "The most epileptogenic intravenous induction agent is etomidate. Etomidate has been associated with grand mal seizures and produces increased EEG activity in \nepileptogenic foci. This feature has proven useful for intraoperative mapping of seizure foci before \nsurgical ablation. Thiopentone and propofol have anticonvulsant properties which are advantageous in \nneurosurgical patients who are at increased risk of seizures. Ketamine has a mixed effect on seizure activity, with either strong pro-convulsant or strong \nanticonvulsant action.",

      "explanation": "As the patient has a history of coronary artery disease, the agent of choice is etomidate.

The myocardial oxygen supply-to-demand ratio is well maintained. It is the IV induction agent of \nchoice in patients with coronary artery disease, cardiomyopathy, and cerebral vascular disease. Adverse effects of etomidate: • Postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV) • Myoclonus • Adrenocortical suppression • Epileptogenic potential Option B: Thiopentone decreases the cardiac output, systemic arterial pressure, and peripheral \nvascular resistance.

      "correct_answer": "c",
      "explanation": "Etomidate has been associated with adrenocortical suppression which can last for 72 hours. Etomidate inhibits the enzyme 11-hydroxylase, resulting in decreased biosynthesis of cortisol and \nmineralocorticoids and increases the formation of intermediaries like 11-deoxycorticosterone. It is a more potent inhibitor of steroid synthesis than as a sedative-hypnotic as the concentration \nwhich produces adrenocortical suppression (10 ng/mL)is much lower than that needed for \nhypnosis (&gt;200 ng/mL).",
