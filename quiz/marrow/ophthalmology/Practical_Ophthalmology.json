Visual acuity is a measure of the spatial resolution of the eye or an estimation of its ability to \ndiscriminate between two points. Snellens chart is used for Visual acuity assesment. In snellens chart the alphabets decrease in size as we move from above-downwards and these \nlines, from above-downwards should be read at 60, 36, 24, 18, 12, 9, 6, 5 and 4 m respectively. At \nthese distances, the respective letters subtend a visual angle of 5 minutes. Hence, the largest \nalphabet that should be read at 60 m subtends a visual angle of 5 minutes in the eye.",

      },
      "correct_answer": "d",
      "explanation": "The given image is suggestive of oculomotor nerve palsy. The central image shows the primary position of gaze where the patient's left eye is deviated down \nand out with ptosis of the left eyelid. From the eye movements in other positions, it can be seen \nthat adduction and elevation are absent and depression is reduced in the left eye. All of these \nfindings are indicative of oculomotor nerve palsy. 3rd Cranial nerve(oculomotor nerve) palsy presents with: • Ptosis due to weakness of levator palpebrae superioris muscle (LPS) • Abduction and depression in the primary position (down and out) due to unopposed action of \nthe lateral rectus(6th nerve supply) and superior oblique muscles(4th nerve supply) • Dilated pupil and defective accommodation due to parasympathetic palsy (involvement of \nEdinger Westphal parasympathetic supply) • Limited adduction, elevation and depression due to ipsilateral paralysis of medial rectus, inferior \noblique and inferior rectus . Option A: Trochlear(4th cranial) nerve palsy presents with superior oblique muscle paralysis. Clinical findings of trochlear nerve palsy include: 581 \nSold by @itachibot • Hypertropia (elevation) in the primary position • Extorsion that is greatest in abduction • Compensatory head posture with contralateral face turn and head tilt with chin slightly \ndepressed. This position is assumed to avoid Diplopia. • Limitation of depression • Normal abduction and elevation. The below given image depicts 4th cranial nerve palsy. Option B: Lateral rectus palsy is seen in cases of isolated Abducens nerve palsy. These patients \npresent with esotropia/convergent squint in primary position with limitation of abduction on the \nside of the lesion. This is due to unopposed action of the medial rectus muscle in the affected eye. There is also a compensatory head turn towards the side of the lesion to reduce the symptom of \nDiplopia. The adduction is normal in lateral rectus palsy. 582 \nSold by @itachibot Option C: Internuclear opthalmoplegia occurs following an injury to the medial longitudinal \nfasciculus (MLF). A unilateral lesion to the MLF leads to the failure of adduction in the ipsilateral \neye with a normal abduction of the contralateral eye. The below given image depicts the pathogenesis of Inter nuclear opthalmoplegia in detail.",

      "explanation": "Photostress test is used to differentiate between the disease involving the macula and optic nerve. This test is of particular use in early macular diseases such as central serous retinopathy. In this test, one eye is covered and the patient is asked to read the smallest line on the near chart. \nA bright light is then shone into the eye for 15 seconds, and the patient is asked to read the line \nagain, and the time taken to recover is noted. The test is repeated with the other eye. 583 \nSold by @itachibot In normal people and in patients with optic nerve disease, the recovery time is not affected. \nWhereas, in patients with macular disease the recovery time is prolonged and is usually more than \none-third of the normal recovery time. This is because, in macular disease, the photoreceptors are \ndamaged, and there is a delay in the visual pigment regeneration process. 584 \nSold by @itachibot Eye Signs in Systemic Disease",
