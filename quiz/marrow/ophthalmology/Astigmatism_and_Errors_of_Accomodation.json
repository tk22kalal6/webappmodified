      "question": "Question 1: A 20-year-old girl started having frequent headaches and blurring of vision while studying for \ncollege exams. She says she feels better when she closes her eyes. On examination, she is \nfound to have astigmatism. Which of the following is the most common cause responsible for \nthis condition?",
      "options": {
        "a": "Irregularity of the curvature of the cornea",

      },
      "correct_answer": "a",
      "explanation": "Abnormalities of the curvature of the cornea is the most common cause of astigmatism. Astigmatism is a refractive error in which the rays of light entering the eye are refracted \ndifferently in different meridia of the eye. Meridia of the eye correspond to the lines of longitude \non a globe. There are two types of astigmatism. In regular astigmatism, refractive power changes uniformly \nfrom one meridian to another. In irregular astigmatism, there is irregular change of the refractive \npower in different meridia. It can be caused by corneal scars. Etiology of regular astigmatism: • Corneal: Most common cause. Occurs due to abnormalities of curvature of the cornea • Lenticular: Occurs due to abnormalities of lens curvature and position • Curvatural: Seen in lenticonus • Positional: Due to tilting or oblique placement of the lens or subluxation of lens • Retinal: Due to oblique placement of the macula 74 \nSold by @itachibot Note: Spherical aberration is a high-order refractive error of the eye. It is seen when light rays \npassing through the periphery of the cornea and lens focus at a slightly different location than \nlight rays passing through the center of the cornea and lens. It improves on using a pinhole.",

      "correct_answer": "a",
      "explanation": "With-the-rule astigmatism is normally seen in the eyes due to the pressure of the eyelids. In with-the-rule astigmatism, the vertical meridian is more curved. This is more common and \noften occurs due to the pressure of eyelids on the eye. In against-the-rule astigmatism (ATR) \n(option B), the horizontal meridian is more curved than the vertical meridian. In both these types, \nthe principal meridia are vertical and horizontal (90 and 180 degrees) and are at right angles to \neach other. The other types of astigmatism include oblique and bi-oblique astigmatism. In oblique \nastigmatism (option C), the two principal meridians are not the horizontal and vertical meridians, \nalthough they are at right angles to each other. In bi-oblique astigmatism (option D), the two \nprincipal meridians are not at right angles to each other; for example, one may be at 40 degrees \nand the other, at 100 degrees. 75 \nSold by @itachibot",

      "explanation": "In with-the-rule astigmatism, the curvature of the vertical meridian is more than the horizontal \nmeridian.

With-the-rule astigmatism is the type of astigmatism wherein the vertical curvature is always \nmore than the horizontal curvature. Thus, irrespective of the type or cause of with-the-rule \nastigmatism, the vertical meridian is always more myopic (curved) than the horizontal meridian.",

Astigmatism is a refractive error in which the rays of light entering the eye are refracted \ndifferently in different meridia of the eye. Meridia of the eye correspond to the lines of longitude \non a globe. There are two types of astigmatism - regular and irregular. In regular astigmatism, refractive power changes uniformly from one meridian to another. Thus, \ntwo principal meridia are present. The rays of light from infinity form two focal points due to the \ndifference in curvature of the two principal meridia. Based on the relation of the two focal points \nto the retina, regular astigmatism has the following types: • Simple astigmatism: One focal point lies on the retina. In simple myopic type, the second focal \npoint lies in front of the retina while in simple hypermetropic type, the second focal point lies \nbehind the retina. • Compound astigmatism: In compound hypermetropic type, both focal points lie behind the \nretina.

      "correct_answer": "b",
      "explanation": "Among the above options, -1.00 DC × 180 degrees is the correct prescription for simple myopic \nastigmatism (SMA). There are 3 components for prescription of glasses. 1. The first number is the refractive power of the spherical component. It is represented as convex \n(+) or concave (-) dioptre sphere (DS). 2. The second number denotes the power of the cylinder, represented as convex (+) or concave (-) \ndioptre cylinder (DC). 3. The above two components are followed by an x representing the axis (orientation) of the \ncylinder. 78 \nSold by @itachibot In the most common type of SMA - with-the-rule astigmatism - meridian A (represented by 90 \ndegrees) is more curved than meridian B (represented by 180 degrees). The light rays refracting \nfrom B focus on the retina, whereas those refracting from A focus in front of the retina. To correct this error, a negative cylindrical lens (DC) is used to focus the myopic rays of meridian \nA on the retina. This correction needs to occur at 90 degrees (meridian A). The axis of a \ncylindrical lens is perpendicular to the required correction and thus, the spectacles will have an \naxis of 180 degrees. There is no spherical refractive error since the light rays from meridian B lies on the retina. Thus \nDS is 0.",

      },
      "correct_answer": "b",
      "explanation": "Near vision accommodation is due to the contraction of the ciliary muscle. Accommodation is the phenomenon of increasing the convergence power. This occurs by \nincreasing the refractive power of the lens and increasing its curvature. The capsule of the lens is \nmore elastic than the lens itself and plays a role in increasing the curvature of the lens. When \nthe circular fibres of the ciliary muscles contract, the ciliary body approaches the lens. This \nslackens the zonules so that the capsule, relieved of its tension, is able to mould the lens to its \naccommodative form.",

      "explanation": "Relaxation of the ciliary muscles would aid in establishing a normal distant vision. Relaxation of the ciliary muscles keeps the zonules in a taut state and maintains the radius of \ncurvature of the anterior lens surface at 10 mm. Thus, the focal length is maximum and distant \nobjects are most clearly visualized. Option B: The pupils constrict during accommodation to increase the depth of focus. Option C: During accommodation, ciliary muscles contract causing relaxation of zonular fibers, \nrounding of the lens, and shortening of the focal length.

The greater the angle of the prism, the more will be the \nbending. In aphakic spectacles, the angle of the lens is large. Thus, the light falling at the edge of \nthe lens bends towards the center of the lens and does not reach the pupil. This results in a \nring-shaped scotoma as this prismatic effect is present all around the edges of the lens. The \nposition of this scotoma is not fixed in the visual field because the eye keeps moving (or roving) in \nrelation to the aphakic spectacle. Hence, the result is a roving ring scotoma.",

      "correct_answer": "d",
      "explanation": "Contact lenses decrease corneal oxygen supply. The cornea obtains its O2 supply from the atmosphere. The use of contact lenses decreases the O2 \nsupply from the atmosphere. Contact lens eliminate peripheral aberrations and can correct \nirregular astigmatism. Although dry eye is caused by wearing contact lenses, lenses made of \nhydrogel which are high in water content are beneficial in dry eye. Rigid gas-permeable/semi-soft contact lens are used for keratoconus. Toric contact lens are used \nfor astigmatism.",

      "correct_answer": "d",
      "explanation": "85 \nSold by @itachibot The given image shows spectacles made of lenses with two different optical power. Thus, it is a \npair of bifocal spectacles which is not used in hypermetropia or myopia. Bifocal glasses have different corrective powers in the upper segment for distant vision and lower \nsegment for near vision. Thus, they are useful in conditions where both distance and near vision \nare affected, like the following: 1. Presbyopia (option A): It is a definitive indication. It is used to correct age-related near and far \nvision defects. 2. Aphakia (option B): It provides both near and far vision correction when intra-ocular lens \ninsertion is contraindicated. 3. Paediatric pseudophakia (option C): It is used to correct refractive errors or accommodative \nfluctuations post intra-ocular lens (IOL) insertion. 4. Non refractive accomodative esotropia In hypermetropia there is defect in near vision only and hence a single vision glasses having \nuniform corrective power throught the entire surface is used instead of bifocal glasses. 86 \nSold by @itachibot Conjunctiva",
