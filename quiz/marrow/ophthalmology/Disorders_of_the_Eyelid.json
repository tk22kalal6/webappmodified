      "explanation": "The given clinical scenario is suggestive of myasthenia gravis and ptosis is the most common \nocular feature of the disease. Myasthenia gravis (MG) is an autoimmune disorder of the neuromuscular junction most \ncommonly caused by anti-acetylcholine receptor antibodies. The disorder is characterized by \nweakness and fatigability of skeletal muscles where the weakness increases during repeated \nuse and may improve following rest. Ptosis and diplopia are common initial complaints due to early involvement of the lids and \nextraocular muscles (EOMs). Of them, Ptosis is a more common manifestation than diplopia. \nPtosis in myasthenia gravis is insidious, bilateral, and frequently asymmetrical. Investigations of myasthenia gravis include: • Ice pack test -This tests for a transient improvement of the ptotic eyelid on placing an ice pack \nfor 2 minutes, as the cold inhibits the breakdown of acetylcholine by acetylcholinesterase. • Tensilon (Edrophonium) test - This tests for a transient improvement in the weakness on \nadministration of a short-acting anticholinesterase such as edrophonium. • Antibody testing - for Acetylcholine receptor (AChR) antibodies, MuSK protein antibodies helps \nsupport a diagnosis of myasthenia gravis.",

      "explanation": "The image shows plexiform neurofibroma of the upper lid causing an S-shaped deformity of the \nupper lid and mechanical ptosis. This is seen particularly in neurofibromatosis type 1. NF1 is caused by the autosomal dominant loss-of-function mutations in the NF1 gene on \nchromosome 17. It is a tumor suppressor gene that encodes neurofibromin, a negative RAS \nregulator. The disease is clinically diagnosed when any two of the following seven features are \npresent: • Six or more café-au-lait macules (CALMs) - They are the hallmark of neurofibromatosis and are \npresent in almost 100% of patients. They are present at birth but increase in size, number, and \npigmentation, especially during the first few years of life, and are scattered over the entire body. • Axillary or inguinal freckling 387 \nSold by @itachibot • Two or more iris Lisch nodules - They are iris hamartomas that are best identified by a slit-lamp \nexamination. They are present in the majority of patients with NF1. • Two or more neurofibromas or 1 plexiform neurofibroma • A distinctive osseous lesion such as sphenoid dysplasia or cortical thinning of long bones such as \nthe tibia • Optic gliomas (most frequently observed CNS tumor in NF1) • A first-degree relative with NF-1",
