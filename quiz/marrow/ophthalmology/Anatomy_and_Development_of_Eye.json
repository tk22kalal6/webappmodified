      "explanation": "A newborn is usually hypermetropic by +2D to +3D. The anteroposterior (AP) diameter of the eyeball at birth is about 16.5 mm, which is about 70% of \nthe adult size. This reduced axial length causes light to converge behind the retina, leading to 12 \nSold by @itachibot hypermetropia. Additionally, the corneal diameter at birth is 10 mm. The adult size (11.7 mm) is attained by 2 \nyears of age. The orbit is more divergent (50°) as compared to adult (45°). Note: The lacrimal glands are underdeveloped in a newborn and, hence, do not secrete tears.",

A coloboma is a congenital malformation in one of the structures in the eye, such as the iris, \nretina, choroid, or optic disc, due to the failure of embryonic fissure closure. Coloboma of the \nuveal tract may be typical (seen in the inferonasal quadrant) or atypical (occasionally found in \nother positions). Typical coloboma is of two types: • Complete: Extends from pupil to optic nerve, causing a corresponding lens indentation. • Incomplete: May involve iris alone, or iris and ciliary body (more common), or iris, ciliary body \nand a part of choroid. Other embryonic remnants in the eye: • Mittendorf's dot - Remnant of the anterior end of the hyaloid artery • Bergmeister papilla - Remnant of the posterior end of the hyaloid artery • Persistent hyperplastic primary vitreous (PHPV) - Failure of fetal vasculature to regress The image below shows a fundoscopy view of persistent hyperplastic primary vitreous. 16 \nSold by @itachibot",

This developmental anomaly may involve the optic nerve, choroid, retina, and iris. Coloboma of \nthe optic disc can present in two forms: a minor effect often associated with refractive errors like \nhypermetropia and astigmatism and a fully developed coloboma that appears as a large \ninferonasal whitish excavation resembling the optic disc. Defective vision and superior visual field defects are typically associated with fully developed \ncoloboma. Additionally, this condition may be associated with chorioretinal coloboma, a \ncongenital anomaly where the developing optic cup fails to fuse completely, leading to abnormal \nchoroidal and retinal development.
