Beta-blockers are not indicated in the treatment of graves ophthalmopathy, however, they are \nused in the symptomatic management of hyperthyroidism. Treatment of thyroid ophthalmopathy: (A) Non-surgical management • Systemic steroids- These form the mainstay of the treatment. Oral, intravenous or orbital steroid \ninjections can be used depending upon patient indications. (Option B) • Radiotherapy- Orbital radiation given in a dose of 2000 rads over 10-14 days can be considered \nin cases where steroids are ineffective/ contraindicated. It is contraindicated in cases of extensive \nthyroid eye disease as it can worsen it. (Option A) • Teprotumumab (IGF-1R inhibitor)- is used for persistent, corticosteroid-resistant disease or \nnon-response to first-line treatment. It is effective in reducing proptosis and clinical activity in \npatients. (B) Surgical management: • Orbital decompression- It may be required for an acutely progressive optic neuropathy and/or \nexposure keratitis, in patients not responding to aggressive steroid therapy. (Option D) • Extraocular muscle surgery- Inferior rectus recession is the most commonly performed surgery. \nThese should be performed after the orbital decompression since decompression may alter \nextraocular motility. Extraocular muscle surgery helps in achieving a binocular single vision in the \nprimary gaze and reading position. • Eyelid surgery- This is done to correct eyelid retraction. Various surgeries that can be performed \nare mullerectomy, levator recession/ disinsertion, scleral grafts with LPS recession, recession of \nlower eyelid retractors, and blepharoplasty.",

The patient also has a severe boring \nheadache. The MRI shows an enhancing mass within the right cavernous sinus. The pain and \nophthalmoplegia respond dramatically to corticosteroid therapy. What is the most likely \ndiagnosis?",

      "correct_answer": "d",
      "explanation": "The patient presents with acute ophthalmoplegia with the involvement of ophthalmic division of \ntrigeminal nerve that responds promptly to steroid therapy. The most likely diagnosis is \nTolosa-Hunt syndrome. It is an idiopathic, sterile inflammation that primarily affects the cavernous sinus. It is \ncharacterized by painful acute ophthalmoplegia with or without the involvement of the optic nerve \nand the ophthalmic division of the trigeminal nerve. The pain is described as gnawing or boring and may precede ophthalmoplegia. The inflammation and pain in patients typically responds rapidly and dramatically to \ncorticosteroid therapy. However, it is a diagnosis of exclusion.",

      "explanation": "The clinical distinction between a cavernous sinus syndrome and an orbital apex syndrome is \nmade by the dysfunction of the optic nerve (CN II). The optic nerve passes through the optic canal and does not enter the cavernous sinus. Patients \nwith orbital apex syndrome manifest complete ophthalmoplegia, ptosis, decreased corneal \nsensation, and vision loss. They usually develop optic nerve signs such as relative afferent \npupillary defect. Proptosis is often present, but patients do not always complain of pain.",

It is a unilateral eye \ncondition. Clinically, it manifests as painful ophthalmoplegia and depending on the extent of involvement, it \nmay present as superior orbital fissure syndrome or orbital apex syndrome. Superior orbital fissure syndrome is characterized by the following: • Pain, typically labeled as retro-orbital ache • Sensory loss/disturbances in the distribution of the ophthalmic division of the 5th cranial nerve • Ipsilateral ophthalmoplegia due to the involvement of the 3rd, 4th, and 6th cranial nerve \ninvolvement • Ptosis, due to 3rd nerve paralysis Orbital apex syndrome includes the following: • Features of superior orbital fissure syndrome described above • Features of optic nerve involvement, i.e., early visual loss and afferent pupillary defect. 441 \nSold by @itachibot Strabismus - Introduction, Symptomatology, and Evaluation",
