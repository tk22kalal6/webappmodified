      "correct_answer": "b",
      "explanation": "Vitamin B1 deficiency can cause acute retrobulbar neuritis. Nutritional optic neuropathy is characterized by bilateral, symmetric, cecocentral scotomas and \ndisturbance of color vision. Fundus morphology is usually normal. Deficiencies in the following vitamins are primarily responsible for the damage caused to the optic \nnerve: B1 (thiamine), B6 (pyridoxine), B9 (folic acid), and B12 (cobalamin). These vitamins are \ncofactors for many metabolic reactions and their deficiency leads to toxic byproduct accumulation \nwithin cells, which inhibits the electron transport chain and depresses mitochondrial function. \nDepletion of ATP leads to nerve dysfunction and eventual nerve death. Chronic alcohol abuse is a commonly associated risk factor and a cause of malnourishment.",

Ocular manifestations of dengue: • Typically, patients complain of painless visual impairment within 1 week from illness onset, \noften around the time of the platelet nadir. • Conjunctival injection and subconjunctival hemorrhage. • Complications such as retinal hemorrhage, retinal edema, macular ischemia, macular edema, \nvitreous hemorrhage, vitritis, and optic neuritis or papillitis 595 \nSold by @itachibot • Depending on the severity of the ocular lesion, gradual improvement in vision occurs over \nseveral weeks, although in rare cases permanent visual impairment may result.",

      "explanation": "The given clinical picture of a young child presenting with unilateral port wine stain in the region \nof trigeminal nerve supply and leptomeningeal angioma as seen on MRI is indicative of \nSturge-Webber syndrome (SWS). Glaucoma is the most common ocular manifestation of SWS. Sturge weber syndrome is a neurocutaneous disorder(phakomatoses) that is characterized by \nunilateral capillary malformation at the region of trigeminal supply known as port wine stain or \nnevus flammeus, ipsilateral diffuse cavernous hemangioma of the choroid and ipsilateral \nleptomeningeal hemangiomatosis, which causes seizures and mental retardation. Ocular manifestation of SWS include: • Glaucoma - most common ocular manifestation. It develops anywhere between infancy to \nadulthood. When developed in infancy it presents as buphthalmos. • Diffuse choroidal hemangioma • Serous retinal detachment • Visual field defects- homonymous hemianopia due to the leptomeningeal hemangiomas affecting \nthe optic tract or occipital lobe. • Heterochromia of the iris • Episcleral and conjunctival lesions Option A: Uveitis is the inflammation of the uveal tissue of the eyes. It can be associated with a \nnumber of systemic conditions such as sarcoidosis, behcet's disease, ankylosing spondylitis, \nreiter's syndrome,Toxoplasmosis and Posner–Schlossman syndrome (PSS). Option B: Retinitis pigmentosa is an inherited or acquired pigmentatory retinal dystrophy \naffecting the rods more.

The classic triad of \nfindings in RP comprises bone-spicule retinal pigmentation, arteriolar attenuation and waxy disc \npallor.
