      "correct_answer": "a",
      "explanation": "The critical angle of the air–cornea interface is 46 degrees. Gonioscopy is a method of evaluating \nthe anterior chamber (AC) angle. Direct goniolenses include the Koeppe, Medical Workshop, Barkan, and Swan–Jacob. Indirect \ngoniolenses include Goldmann, Zeiss, and Posner. Structures seen on gonioscopy from anterior to posterior are: • Schwalbe line: represents the posterior limit of Descemet's membrane • Trabecular meshwork • Scleral spur • Ciliary body and root of the iris Shaffers grading of angle width: Grade 4 (35–45°) is the widest angle, characteristic of myopia and pseudophakia; the ciliary body \ncan be visualized without tilting the lens. Grade 3 (25–35°) is an open-angle in which the scleral spur is visible. Grade 2 (20°) is an angle in which the trabeculum but not the scleral spur can be seen. Grade 1 (10°) is a very narrow-angle in which only the Schwalbe line, and perhaps the top of the \ntrabeculum, can be identified. A slit angle is one in which there is no obvious iridocorneal contact but no angle structures can be \nidentified. Grade 0 (0°) is closed due to iridocorneal contact.",

      "correct_answer": "a",
      "explanation": "The given clinical scenario of an infant with large corneas, lacrimation and photophobia \nsupported with the image is suggestive of congenital glaucoma. Primary congenital glaucoma (PCG) also known as developmental glaucoma refers to abnormally \nhigh intraocular pressure(IOP) which results from the developmental anomaly of the angle of the \nanterior chamber. It can be classified as: • True congenital or newborn glaucoma in which IOP is elevated during intrauterine life and the \nbaby is born with ocular enlargement. • Infantile glaucoma: which manifests prior to age 3 years. • Juvenile glaucoma: IOP rises between 3 and 16 years of age. Clinical findings include: • Blepharospasm • Buphthalmos: Large eyeball due to stretching of the globe from elevated IOP prior to the age of 3 \nyears. • Corneal enlargement: • Corneal haze is due to corneal edema. • Blue sclera - due to the shining of the underlying uveal tissue through the thinned-out sclera • Haab striae are healed breaks in Descemet's membrane Treatment: • Goniotomy - when the angle of the anterior chamber is visible through the clear cornea. • Trabeculectomy when the corneal clouding prevents visualization of the angle. • Filtration procedures such as Trabeculectomy or combined trabeculectomy with trabeculectomy \nif the above procedures fail. • Glaucoma drainage devices in unresponsive cases. Other options: Option A: Retinoblastoma is the most common primary intraocular malignancy of childhood that \nis seen between 1-2 years. 315 \nSold by @itachibot Findings of Retinoblastoma include: • Leukocoria (white pupillary reflex)- the most common manifestation • Strabismus • Painful red eye with secondary glaucoma • An endophytic tumor grows into the vitreous as a white mass that may ‘seed’ into the gel. If \ncalcification is present it gives a \"cottage cheese appearance\". An exophytic tumor grows outwards \nand causes overlying exudative retinal detachment. The image below shows the leucocoria of the left eye. Option C: Congenital hereditary endothelial dystrophy (CHED) is an inherited corneal dystrophy \nthat manifests since birth with endothelial degeneration. It appears as diffuse bilateral corneal \nedema in the absence of elevated IOP. The clinical features of the disease include corneal \nclouding, visual impairment, and nystagmus. Option D: Megalocornea is a bilateral non-progressive X-linked condition that most commonly \naffects males. In this condition, the horizontal corneal diameter is 12mm(&lt;2 years) and is 13 \nmm(&gt;2 years). It is characterized by a clear cornea, normal corneal thickness, and no breaks in \nthe descemet's membrane. Systemic associations of Megalocornea include Marfan's syndrome, \nApert syndrome, Ehlers-Danlos, and Down syndrome.",

Timolol is one of the first-line \nagents used in the treatment of primary open-angle glaucoma. First-line agents for the treatment of glaucoma are: • Prostaglandin analogs such as latanoprost and bimatoprost • Topical beta-blockers such as timolol, betaxolol, and levobunolol • Selective alpha 2 adrenergic agonist brimonidine Adjunctive therapy: Carbonic anhydrase inhibitors Laser trabeculoplasty: In cases where intraocular pressure (IOP) is uncontrolled despite maximal \ntolerated medical therapy. Note: Since prostaglandin (PG) analogs are not included in the options, the next best option to \nchoose is timolol. Historically, beta-blockers were the most common first-line agents used in the medical treatment \nof POAG. However, with an increase in our experience with newer agents, specifically the \nprostaglandin analogues that facilitate outflow, they were recognized as being more efficacious in \nlowering IOP and systemically safer than beta-blockers.

      "explanation": "This patient with a history of asthma now presenting with shortness of breath after starting \nmedications for increased intraocular pressure was most likely diagnosed with glaucoma. The \ndrug she was likely prescribed was timolol, a non-selective beta blocker. Timolol is a non-selective beta-blocker that is used in glaucoma. Non-selective beta-blockers can \ncause precipitation of bronchial asthma in susceptible individuals (beta-2 block on bronchi). They \ncause bronchospasms and are therefore contraindicated in patients with asthma (e.g. timolol, \nlevobunolol). Ocular beta-blockers reduce intraocular pressure by decreasing aqueous \nformation by blockade of 2 receptors. Timolol is specifically associated with allergic \nblepharoconjunctivitis and punctal stenosis Side effects: Systemic: Bronchospasm, bradycardia, decreased cardiac output, hypotension, \ndepression, impotence, and altered lipid profile. 320 \nSold by @itachibot Contraindications: Asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, congestive heart failure, sinus \nbradycardia, and atrioventricular blocks Other options: Option A: The patient has been stable on aspirin for the past three years which is unlikely to be \nthe cause of her current symptoms. Option B: Betaxolol is a beta 1 selective blocker that is used in glaucoma and has a lower \npropensity to precipitate bronchial asthma.

Although \nneovascular glaucoma occurs as a complication in Eale's disease (Option B) and central retinal \nartery occlusion (Option C) and long-term use of topical steroid therapy causes steroid-induced \nglaucoma (Option D) none of them are termed as 100-day glaucoma. CRVO is further classified into two types: • Non-ischemic CRVO: occurs secondary to venous stasis.It is the most common type of CRVO of \nthe two. • Ischemic CRVO: occurs due to acute occlusion of the central retinal vein. It is also termed as \nhemorrhagic retinopathy. Ischemic CRVO presents with sudden loss of vision and Relative afferent pupil defect(RAPD). 326 \nSold by @itachibot Fundus examination shows massive enlargement of retinal veins and massive retinal hemorrhages \ngiving a \"splashed tomato appearance\". Other findings include cotton wool spots, optic disc edema \nand neovascularization at the disc and in the periphery.

Option B: Eales disease is an idiopathic inflammatory disease of the peripheral retinal veins.It is \nconsidered to be a hypersensitivity reaction to the tubercular proteins and it is commonly seen in \nyoung males. It is characterized by recurrent vitreous hemorrhage. Complications include: • Neovascular glaucoma • Proliferative vitreoretinopathy • Tractional retinal detachment, • Rubeosis iridis Option C: Central retinal artery occlusion(CRAO) is most often caused due to an embolus from an \natherosclerotic plaque.
