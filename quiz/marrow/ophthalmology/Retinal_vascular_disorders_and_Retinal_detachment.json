The retina consists of 10 layers. The retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) is the outermost layer - \nbelow the Bruch's membrane of the choroid - and the internal limiting membrane is the innermost \nlayer - separating the retina from the vitreous. The retinal pigment epithelium consists of a single layer of cells containing pigment. It is \nseparated from the neurosensory retinal layers by the potential space between them which is \nknown as interphotoreceptor matrix. The inner plexiform layer consists of synapsing nerve fibers. The axons of bipolar cells synapse \nwith dendrites of ganglion cells; and both these processes synapse with processes \nof amacrine cells. It also contains some horizontally placed internal plexiform cells; and also a \nfew ganglion cells.",

      "explanation": "The distance of the fovea from the temporal margin of the optic disc is 2 disc diameters. The fovea is an excavation in the retinal surface at the center of the macula, with a diameter of 1.5 \nmm, which is about the same as that of the optic disc. The foveola forms the bottom of the fovea \nand has a diameter of 0.35 mm. It is devoid of ganglion cells. The umbo is the central floor the \nfoveola, which corresponds to the foveolar light reflex. The foveal avascular zone (FAZ) is a central \narea (including foveola and surrounding areas) which contains no blood vessels but is surrounded \nby a continuous network of capillaries. The macula is a round area at the posterior pole, lying inside the temporal vascular arcades. It \nmeasures 5.5 mm in diameter. The inner layers of the macula contain the yellow xanthophyll \ncarotenoid pigments lutein and zeaxanthin in far higher concentrations than the peripheral retina \n(hence, the full name \"macula lutea\", which means yellow plaque). 201 \nSold by @itachibot",

      },
      "correct_answer": "b",
      "explanation": "Optic disc hypoplasia does not cause enlargement of the blind spot. The physiological blind spot is an area of absolute scotoma in the visual field, seen in the region of \noptic disc. It is due to the absence of photoreceptors (rods and cones) in that region. Enlarged \nblind spot is seen in primary open-angle glaucoma (POAG) (Option A), papilledema (Option C), \nmedullated nerve fibers (Option D), optic disc drusen, coloboma of optic disc and myopic disc with a crescent. Optic nerve hypoplasia is the most common congenital optic disc anomaly. There is \nunderdevelopment of the optic disc in the disease and it typically presents with a small disc that is \nsurrounded by a yellowish pigmented ring, called the 'double ring sign'. Option A: In primary open-angle glaucoma(POAG), the optic disc enlargement is seen secondary \nto increased intra-ocular pressure (IOP) in the eye. Option C: Papilledema is a passive disc swelling seen with raised intracranial pressure. The blind \nspot is enlarged due to the edema of the optic disc. Option D: Medullated or opaque nerve fibers are the abnormal myelination of nerve fibers of the \nretina. Normally, optic nerve myelination stops at the level of lamina cribrosa. If the myelination \ncontinues beyond the optic disc it leads to the expansion of the blind spot. On ophthalmoscopic \nexamination, these are seen as a whitish patch with feathery margins.",

Their nuclei lie in the inner nuclear layer and their processes extend across the \nretinal layers to form the inner and outer limiting membranes. Their functions include: 1. Providing structural stability to the retina 2. Interacting with other neurons and their functional and metabolic support 3. Providing neurons with trophic substances and removing metabolic waste 4.

The incidence of proliferative retinopathy in SC disease (Hb SC) is 33%, sickle cell thalassemia \n(Hb S-Thal) is 14%, SS disease (Hb SS) is 3%. In sickle cell retinopathy, elevated blood viscosity \nmay occlude venules and arterioles, as well as capillaries. The following fundus findings can be \nnoted as a result: • Retinal vascular peripheral non-perfusion • Retinal hemorrhages: \"salmon patches,\" \"iridescent spots,\" and \"black sunbursts\" are hallmarks \nof nonproliferative sickle cell retinopathy. • Peripheral retinal neovascularization in a \"sea fan\" configuration is the hallmark of proliferative \nsickle cell retinopathy. They are also described as \"parachute\" lesions. They are most commonly \nfound in the supero-temporal vascular arcades. • Angioid streaks (Rupture of Bruch’s membrane) Conjunctival \"comma-shaped\" capillaries and iris atrophy are other ocular findings seen. \nComplications of sickle cell retinopathy include central retinal vein occlusion (CRVO) (occurs due \nto retinal hypoxia), vitreous hemorrhage and tractional retinal detachment.

Central retinal artery occlusion (CRAO) occurs due to obstruction of the retinal artery at the level \nof lamina cribrosa. Risk factors include heart disease, carotid artery disease, mucormycosis, \nvaricella infection, radiation exposure and trauma. It may be caused by the following: • Emboli of carotid artery or cardiac origin are the most common cause of CRAO. Other emboli \nare cholesterol emboli, calcium emboli, and platelet fibrin emboli • Atherosclerosis-related thrombosis • Retinal arteritis with obliteration • Angiospasm • Raised intraocular pressure • Thrombophilic disorders 216 \nSold by @itachibot Patients often present with sudden painless monocular loss of vision with history of a similar \nepisode that resolved spontaneously (amaurosis fugax).

Fundus examination shows \nmarked attenuation of arteries (thread like arteries), interrupted blood flow in vein (cattle \ntrack appearance), cherry red spot, severe edema and retinal pallor. A cherry-red spot of the macula is typical and arises in this area because of the absence of \nganglion cells at the foveola resulting in the transmission of the normal choroidal color. This in \ncontrast to the surrounding area where intense retinal whitening blocks the transmission of the \nnormal choroidal color. Treatment is to dislodge the emboli by suddenly decreasing the IOP by IV acetazolamide or ocular \nmassage. Ocular massage is considered the most effective method. Other treatment options \ninclude IV mannitol, vasodilators (nitrates), fibrinolytic therapy, or laser photodisruption in some \ncases. In cases of giant cell arteritis, steroids are beneficial.",

      "explanation": "The prodromal symptoms of flashing lights, floaters followed by loss of monocular vision (curtain \nover the eye) and the B-scan suggest a diagnosis of rhegmatogenous retinal detachment. \nRhegmatogenous retinal detachment is the result of the accumulation of fluid between NSR and \nRPE due to a retinal tear. Retinal detachment is the separation of the neurosensory retina from the retinal pigment \nepithelium. Rhegmatogenous retinal detachment is the most common type of retinal detachment. \nIt occurs due to fluid accumulation after a retinal break (tear). High myopia, trauma, \npseudophakia, aphakia are predisposing factors. Patients present with photopsia (flashes of light \ndue to vitreoretinal traction at the site of the break), floaters and visual field defect (black \ncurtain/veil in front of the eye). Signs include hypotony, as the liquefied vitreous in the subretinal space is absorbed through the \nRPE and Shafers sign or tobacco dusting (pigments in the anterior vitreous).

The most dangerous type \nof retinal break is horseshoe tear and the most dangerous location of retinal break is the \nsupero-temporal retina. Treatment is by prophylactic laser barrage, scleral buckling, pneumatic retinopexy and pars plana \nvitrectomy. Other types of retinal detachment are tractional and exudative type: Tractional retinal detachment occurs when fibro-vascular membranes in the vitreous due to \nlong-standing retinal neovascularization exert traction on the retina.
