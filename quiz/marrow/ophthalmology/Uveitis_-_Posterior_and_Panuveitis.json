Vogt–Koyanagi–Harada syndrome is an idiopathic, multi-system disorder characterised by \nautoimmunity against melanocytes. It is associated with HLA-DR1 and HLA-DR4 across different \nracial groups. 356 \nSold by @itachibot Patients may present with cutaneous, neurological and ocular features. Cutaneous features \ninclude alopecia, poliosis and vitiligo (option A). Neurological features include meningism, \nencephalopathy, tinnitus, deafness and vertigo (option B). Ocular features include bilateral \nchronic granulomatous panuveitis (option C), posterior uveitis, exudative retinal detachment, \nperilimbal vitiligo (Suguiura's sign) and sunset glow appearance of the fundus. The modified diagnostic criteria for Vogt–Koyanagi–Harada syndrome are as follows: • Absence of a history of penetrating ocular trauma • Absence of other ocular disease entities • Bilateral uveitis • Neurological and auditory manifestations • Integumentary findings, not preceding the onset of the central nervous system or ocular \ndiseases, such as alopecia, poliosis, and vitiligo. The treatment is high-dose (1–2 mg/kg/day) oral prednisolone, tapered over 3–6 months. This may \nbe preceded by intravenous methylprednisolone pulse therapy (500–1000 mg/day).",

      "explanation": "Recurrent oral ulcers, ulcers over his scrotum with binocular pain and redness and a positive \npathergy test point to a diagnosis of Behcet's disease. HLA B5 (HLA B51) is associated with \nBehcet's disease. Behcet's disease is a systemic vasculitis that can cause recurrent oral ulcers, genital ulcers, skin \nlesions and ocular inflammation. Pathergy test is usually positive. Ocular inflammation occurs in \nabout 70% of patients and tends to be more severe in men. A classical presentation is \nrelapsing/remitting acute onset panuveitis with retinal vasculitis which resolves spontaneously \neven without treatment. It is usually bilateral and non-granulomatous. Patients present with a \ntransient mobile hypopyon in a relatively white eye. They may develop visual impairment if retinal \nvascular disease (vasculitis and occlusion) occurs. Other options: Option A: HLA-B27 is associated with Reiter's syndrome. Option B: HLA DR1 and HLA-DR4 are associated with Vogt–Koyanagi–Haradas disease. Option D: HLA Bw54 is associated with Possner–Scholssman syndrome. Note: The association between HLA-A29 and birdshot retinochoroidopathy is the most consistent \nof any medical disorder.

Sarcoidosis is a chronic granulomatous multi-system disease. Ocular inflammation occurs in 25–\n70% of sarcoid patients, which includes uveitis, conjuctival and lacrimal gland involvement. \nChronic granulomatous panuveitis may be seen. Anterior uveitis is the most common \nmanifestation. In anterior uveitis due to sarcoidosis, \"mutton fat\" keratic precipitates (KPs) and/or small \ngranulomatous KPs with iris nodules (Koeppe and/or Busacca) are seen.

Microangiopathy of the retina in HIV consists of the hemorrhages, micro-aneurysms and \ncotton-wool spots or soft exudates (axonal debris). Cotton wool spots are the most common \nfinding of HIV retinopathy. HIV leads to multiple opportunistic infections of the eye like cytomegalovirus (CMV) - most \ncommon cause of posterior uveitis in HIV - toxoplasmosis, Pneumocystis carinii and herpes \nzoster. These infections present as keratitis, choroiditis, retinitis and endophthalmitis. The most common ocular adverse effect in patients receiving highly active antiretroviral therapy \n(HAART) is immune recovery uveitis (IRU). It is a non-granulomatous uveitis (usually anterior \nuveitis and vitritis) associated with a paradoxical or exaggerated reactivation of the immune \nsystem and an increase in intraocular inflammation. It occurs after receiving HAART for CMV \nchorioretinitis. Visual complications of IRU include cataract, cystoid macular edema (CME), \nglaucoma, and epiretinal membrane formation.",

The most rapid and accurate method to diagnose \ncytomegalovirus (CMV) retinitis is viral nucleic acid detection in the intraocular fluid. CMV retinitis is an opportunistic infection seen in HIV patients with a CD4+ count less than \n50/L. Patients present with reduced vision due to macular involvement and floaters due to \nvitritis. One eye is usually affected initially. Retinitis is seen. Frosted branch angiitis (FBA), which \nis marked vascular sheathing that occurs in about 6% patients, may be seen. Cataract is common \nlate-stage manifestation of CMV retinitis. Highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) is the mainstay of management, restoring the \npatient’s innate ability to suppress CMV activity. Valganciclovir is a prodrug of ganciclovir that is \ntaken orally. Ganciclovir slow-release intravitreal implant can also be used.

Patients present with confluent peripheral necrotizing retinitis, retinal arteritis with \nvaso-occlusion, and vitritis. Rhegmatogenous retinal detachments are common due to retinal \nthinning from large areas of necrosis. The posterior pole is involved only in the later stages. Aciclovir is administered intravenously (10 mg/kg, every 8 hours) for 10–14 days, and then orally \n(800 mg, five times daily) for 6–12 weeks. Oral valaciclovir or famciclovir may be substituted for \noral aciclovir, with similar outcomes but better tolerability. Intravitreal ganciclovir or foscarnet \nmay enhance the prognosis. Systemic steroids may be started 24 hours after the initiation of \nantiviral therapy, especially in severe cases. Laser retinopexy is performed around necrotic areas.
