The lens fibers are produced by mitosis of the epithelial cells in the pre-equatorial zone. As the \nlens fibers elongate and the new ones are formed, the older ones are pushed towards the depth of \nthe lens so that the youngest fibers are the most superficially located. 268 \nSold by @itachibot",

Types of lens nucleus and their age of development: • Embryonic nucleus: Innermost nucleus formed at around 1–3 months of gestation • Fetal nucleus: From 3 months of gestation till birth • Infantile nucleus: From birth to puberty • Adult nucleus As lens fibers grow anteriorly and posteriorly, a pattern emerges where the ends of the fibers \nmeet. These patterns of cell association are known as sutures. Y-shaped sutures are recognizable at about 8 weeks of gestation. 269 \nSold by @itachibot",

It is the annular region (1–2 mm in width and 8–9 mm in diameter) where the vitreous is attached \nto the posterior aspect of the lens. Erggelet’s or Berger’s space is at the centre of the hyaloideo-capsular ligament, a potential space \nbetween the vitreous and the lens. The canal of Cloquet arises from this space and courses \nposteriorly through the central vitreous, which is the former site of the hyaloid artery in the \nembryonic vitreous. Posteriorly, Cloquet’s canal opens into a funnel-shaped region anterior to the optic disc, whch is \nknown as the area of Martegiani. 270 \nSold by @itachibot",

      "explanation": "Ascorbate and alpha-tocopherol are maintained in the lens in the reduced, functional state \nby glutathione. Glutathione is present in high concentrations in the lens, particularly in the epithelial layer. One \nof its key functions is to maintain protein thiols in their reduced state, which preserves the lens \ntransparency by preventing the formation of high molecular weight crystalline aggregates and \nprotects the lens from oxidative stress. The lens is highly prone to photochemical reactions from continuous exposure to ultraviolet rays \n(295–400 nm), leading to reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation. Its defence relies heavily on \nsuperoxide dismutase, ascorbate, catalase and glutathione peroxidase. With ageing or cataracts, levels of glutathione and ascorbic acid (in reduced form) significantly \ndecrease.",

      "explanation": "Cataract surgery with an intraocular lens (IOL) implantation is the treatment of choice in \ncongenital cataracts. 277 \nSold by @itachibot It involves an extracapsular cataract extraction (ECCE) with primary posterior capsulorhexis and \nanterior vitrectomy. After removal of the cataractous lens, a posterior chamber intraocular lens \n(PCIOL) is implanted. The critical period for the development of the fixation reflex in both unilateral and bilateral visual \ndeprivation disorders is 2–4 months of age. Thus, any cataract dense enough to impair vision \nmust be dealt with before this age, and the earliest possible time is preferred. • Bilateral dense cataract- early surgery by 4-6 weeks of age • Unilateral dense cataract or involving visual axis- urgent surgery within days Intracapsular cataract extraction (ICCE) is contraindicated in children.",
