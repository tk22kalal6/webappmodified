Ex-PRESS glaucoma implant is a small stainless steel device. It is inserted under a scleral flap \nduring a modified trabeculectomy. Complications such as hypotony are lower than with standard \ntrabeculectomy. Glaucoma drainage devices are devices that allow aqueous outflow by establishing communication \nbetween the anterior chamber and sub-Tennon's space/sub-conjunctival space. While these \ndevices were traditionally reserved for high-risk patients, or after trabeculectomy had failed, they \nare becoming increasingly popular. The commonly used devices are as follows: 1. Shunts using episcleral explants • Ahmed glaucoma valve: Silicone • Molteno implant - Polypropylene plate and silicone plate • Baerveldt implant - Silicone 2.

      "explanation": "Tonopen is used for measuring intraocular pressure (IOP) in a scarred cornea. It is a hand-held electronic contact tonometer (a modified version of the older Mackay–Marg \ntonometer). Besides portability, its main advantage is the ability to measure IOP reasonably \naccurately in eyes with distorted or edematous corneas and through a soft contact lens. Types of tonometry: • Indentation tonometry- Reading depends on scleral rigidity, e.g., Schiotz tonometer 625 \nSold by @itachibot • Applanation tonometry- Based on the amount of force needed to flatten or applanate a known \narea of the cornea, Imbert–Fick principle. This is further divided into two types - • Fixed force: IOP is proportional to the area, e.g., Maklakov, Barraquer • Fixed area and variable force: IOP is proportional to force. The most reliable is Goldmann. • Self-measurement: Rebound • Non-contact type: Pulse Air, Air-Puff • Irregular cornea: Tonopen, MacKay–Marg Recent tonometers: • Pascals tonometer (dynamic contour tonometry [DCT]): Contact; used for post-LASIK IOP \nmeasurement. • Reichert Ocular Response Analyzer®: Non-contact Note: Tonography is a non-invasive technique for determining the facility of aqueous outflow.

      "correct_answer": "a",
      "explanation": "Retinoscopy is an objective method used to determine the error of refraction by applying \nthe method of neutralization. It is also called skiascopy or shadow test. Principle: When light is reflected from a mirror into the eye, the direction in which light will travel \nacross the pupil will depend upon the eye's refractive state. Distance: Usually, the doctor sits at a distance of 1 meter or an arm's length. Types of retinoscopes: • Priestley–Smith retinoscope • Streak retinoscope The image given below shows a retinoscopy being performed on a patient. 635 \nSold by @itachibot",
