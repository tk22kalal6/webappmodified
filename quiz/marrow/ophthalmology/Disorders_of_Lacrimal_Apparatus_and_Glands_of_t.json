      "explanation": "The nasolacrimal duct is 12–18 mm long. The lacrimal drainage system consists of the lacrimal sac, which is 10–12 mm long. It lies in the \nlacrimal fossa, between the anterior and posterior lacrimal crests. The lacrimal bone and the \nfrontal process of the maxilla separate the lacrimal sac from the middle meatus of the nasal cavity. The nasolacrimal duct is the inferior continuation of the lacrimal sac. It is 12–18 mm long and is \ndirected downwards, backward, and laterally. The opening of the duct into the inferior meatus is \npartially covered by a mucosal fold (valve of Hasner). The puncta are openings on the lid margin. There are two canaliculi from the puncta. Each \ncanaliculus (superior and inferior) has two parts: Vertical (2 mm) and horizontal (8 mm). The \nsuperior and inferior canaliculi usually unite to form the common canaliculus, which opens into \nthe lateral wall of the lacrimal sac. A small flap of mucosa (Rosenmüller valve) overhangs the \njunction of the common canaliculus and the lacrimal sac and prevents the reflux of tears into the \ncanaliculi.
