      "correct_answer": "a",
      "explanation": "The child should be operated at 4-6 weeks of age. 288 \nSold by @itachibot When a child has unilateral or bilateral cataract impairing vision (involving the visual axis), the \ncataract surgery must be performed before 2-4 months of age. This is because 2-4 months is the \ncritical period for visual maturation and development of the fixation reflex in children. A \nunilateral cataract is more dangerous than a bilateral cataract because the risk of amblyopia is \ngreater. Under-correction of intraocular lens (IOL) power is needed in children. In children &lt; 2 years of age: • In unilateral cases, primary implantation is indicated as soon as the patient is fit for anesthesia, \nideally between 2 and 3 months of age. The power is undercorrected by 20%. • The earlier the surgery is done, the better the chance that deep amblyopia can be overcome. • After the cataract has been aspirated, an elective posterior capsulectomy–anterior vitrectomy is \nperformed. The posterior chamber IOL is inserted through a scleral tunnel, which is prepared in \nadvance. • Sulcus implantation is indicated in neonates and infants less than 1 year of age. In children between 2 and 8 years of age: • An IOL is implanted but power is undercorrected by 10%. • An in-the-bag IOL is chosen for children above 1 year of age because they are less likely to need \nan IOL exchange. Beyond 8 years, IOL power is the same as the calculated value.",

      "explanation": "The self-sealing sclerocorneal tunnel incision is made in small-incision cataract surgery (SICS). SICS is a type of extracapsular cataract extraction techniques (ECCE). In these techniques, \nthe major portion of the anterior capsule with the epithelium, nucleus, and cortex are removed, \nleaving behind the intact posterior capsule. Note: Newer cataract surgeries include femtosecond laser-assisted cataract surgery (FLACS), \nmicro-incision cataract surgery (MICS) and Phaconit. FLACS is a microincision cataract surgery or \na micro-phacoemulsification where a femtosecond laser is used to make the corneal incisions, \nperform capsulorhexis and fragment the lens. MICS refers to the phacoemulsification techniques \nthat can be performed through a microincision (&lt;2 mm). Phaconit is the term for the bimanual \nmicro-phacoemulsification done with the needle incision technique through an incision of \n&lt;1mm.",

In phacoemulsification, the nucleus of the lens is emulsified and aspired. This is done by the \nphacoemulsifier. It acts through a hollow 1-mm titanium needle, which vibrates by at an \nultrasonic speed of 40000 times a second. The steps of phacoemulsification are given below: • Step 1 - Small clear corneal incision • Step 2 - Continuous curvilinear capsulorhexis • Step 3 - Hydro dissection • Step 4 - Hydro delineation is done in some cases. • Steps 5 and 6 - Emulsification and aspiration of the nucleus • Step 7 - Removal of the cortical lens matter using an irrigation-aspiration technique • Step 8 - Implantation of a foldable lens Length of the incision in various cataract surgeries: • Phacoemulsification- 1.5–2.4 mm. • Micro-phacoemulsification- 1–1.5 mm. • Intracapsular cataract extraction (ICCE)- 12–14 mm. • Extracapsular cataract extraction (ECCE)- 8–12 mm. 290 \nSold by @itachibot",

Other potential sources include \ncontaminated solutions and instruments, environmental air, and the surgeon and other operating \nroom personnel. Prophylaxis for postoperative endophthalmitis includes: • Instillation of 5% povidone-iodine into the conjunctival fornices and leaving this undisturbed for \nat least 3 minutes prior to surgery. This is the most important factor. • Scrupulous preparation of the surgical site • Treatment of pre-existing infections such as blepharitis • Antibiotic prophylaxis • Intracameral cefuroxime (1 mg in 0.1 mL) injected into the anterior chamber (AC) at the end of \nsurgery. 291 \nSold by @itachibot • Post-operative subconjunctival injection can achieve bactericidal levels in the AC for at least 1–2 \nhours. • Preoperative topical fluoroquinolone antibiotics are frequently given in regimens from 1 hour to \n3 days before surgery Patients present with ocular pain, diminished vision, circumciliary congestion and hypopyon. The \ndifferential diagnosis for postoperative endophthalmitis includes retained lens material in the AC, \nvitreous hemorrhage, postoperative uveitis and toxic reaction to the use of inappropriate or \ncontaminated irrigating fluid or viscoelastic.",

      "correct_answer": "d",
      "explanation": "A post cataract surgery patient presenting within 36 hours of surgery with inflammation, \ncongestion and hypopyon as seen in the image, is suggestive of acute bacterial endophthalmitis. \nThe treatment of acute bacterial endophthalmitis is intravitreal antibiotics. Endophthalmitis is an intraocular inflammation affecting the inner structures of the eyeball. \nAcute postoperative bacterial endophthalmitis occurs within 1-7 days after cataract surgery and \nthe most important factor to prevent it is preoperative administration of 5% povidone iodine. The \ncardinal features of endophthalmitis are pain, swelling of the lid, and a decrease in vision. The \npatient classically shows inflammation of the eye, corneal edema and a hypopyon due to the \npouring of exudates in the vitreous cavity, anterior chamber, and posterior chamber. Once the endophthalmitis sets in it is important to treat all the cases empirically with a \ncombination of antibiotics and steroids from the beginning. The various drugs, routes and surgical \nmanagement used to treat endophthalmitis are as follows: • The mainstay of treatment is intravitreal injections of antibiotics. • First choice: Vancomycin 1 mg in 0.1 mL plus ceftazidime 2.25mg in 0.1ml. • Second choice:Vancomycin 1 mg in 0.1 mL plus amikacin 0.4mg in 0.1ml. • If there is no improvement, a repeat intravitreal injection should be given after 48 hours • Topical antibiotics are started immediately and used frequently. • Vancomycin (50mg/ml) or cefazolin (50mg/ml) • Amikacin (20mg/ml) or tobramycin • Systemic antibiotics have a limited role in the treatment but are commonly used in practice. • Steroid therapy includes: • Intravitreal injection of dexamethasone (0.4mg in 0.1ml) which is started along with antibiotics. • Topical dexamethasone (0.1%) • Oral steroids such as prednisolone are started after 24 hours of intensive antibiotic therapy. • Supportive therapy includes: • Cycloplegics such as atropine 1% 292 \nSold by @itachibot • Anti-glaucoma drugs such as oral acetazolamide or timolol in patients with raised intraocular \npressure • Pars plana vitrectomy is done if the patient does not improve with the above therapy in 48-72 \nhours or when the visual acuity is reduced to hand movements near the eye Other options: Option A: Steroids are given in endophthalmitis to reduce the inflammation of the tissues. The \npreferred route of administration is either by intravitreal injections, topical concentrations or oral \nroute. Intravenous route (option A) of administration of steroids is not used in endophthalmitis. Option B: Systemic administration (intravenous) of antibiotics have a limited role in the treatment \nbut are commonly used in practice as an add on.",

      "correct_answer": "a",
      "explanation": "Diminished vision 1 year after cataract surgery, supported with the image of vacoulated clusters \nseen behind IOL is suggestive of Elschnig’s pearls. It is a type of after cataract. After cataract, or secondary cataract or posterior capsular opacification, is a late postoperative \ncomplication that follows extracapsular extraction of the lens. It is the most common late \npostoperative complication. It may be caused by residual opaque lens matter or proliferation of \nleft out anterior epithelial cells. Different types of after cataract include: • Elschnig’s pearls: The subcapsular epithelial cells proliferate and develop into vacuolated soap \nbubble like clusters along the posterior capsule. • Soemmering’s ring: A peripheral dense ring is formed behind the iris and is enclosed between \nlayers of the capsule. • Dense membranous after-cataract: It is formed in the pupillary area impairing the vision. • Thin membranous after-cataract: It is thickened posterior capsule. 293 \nSold by @itachibot Treatment of after cataract is by Nd-YAG laser capsulotomy of the posterior capsule, which works \non the principle of photodisruption, or surgical posterior capsulotomy. Option B: Irvine–Gass syndrome is cystoid macular edema (CME) that develops in post-cataract \nsurgery patients. Though it is mostly clinically insignificant, some cases can present with blurring \nof vision, one to three months after surgery. In CME, on fundoscopy a honeycomb appearance \nand on fundus fluorescein angiography(FFA) flower petal pattern can be seen. The below image \ndepicts the flower petal pattern seen on FFA. Option C: Post operative endophthalmitis presents as ocular pain, diminished vision and \nhypopyon within months to years after the surgery. Fungal endophthalmitis can rarely occur with \npuff ball exudates in the vitreous cavity. Option D: UGH syndrome is where uveitis, glaucoma and hyphema occurs simultaneously.

The lens swells and \ncauses secondary angle closure glaucoma. • Phacolytic glaucoma: Seen in hypermature cataract. The leaked lens proteins are engulfed by \nmacrophages, which clog the trabecular meshwork and cause secondary open-angle glaucoma. • Phacotopic glaucoma: Seen in hypermature cataract.

      },
      "correct_answer": "c",
      "explanation": "In the above case scenario, gonioscopy would be the least helpful. A painless decrease in vision after cataract surgery could be due to: • Posterior capsular opacification (most commonly, after 1-3 months) • Cystoid macular edema (early) • Rhegmatogenous retinal detachment (delayed) In the given question, the media is clear (rules out posterior capsular opacification). Also, there \nare no symptoms nor signs of retinal detachment (RD), hence it is ruled out. Decreased vision not \nimproving with a pinhole in the presence of clear media is attributable to macular pathology. Also, \nthere is a dull foveal reflex. The diagnosis in this patient is cystoid macular edema (CME). The incidence of clinical CME is about 1% to 2% following uncomplicated cataract surgeries. The \nincidence of angiographic evidence of CME is 10 times greater at around 10% to 20%. Optical coherence tomography (option A) is useful in identifying cystoid macular edema and \nevaluating the vitreomacular interface.

Biometry consists of keratometry and axial length measurement. The most common method of \ndetermining IOL power uses a regression formula called modified Sanders–Retzlaff– Kraff (SRK) \nformula, which is given below: E = A - 2.5L - 0.9K Where, • E is the emmetropic power designated for the eye • A is a predetermined constant, which is specific for each intraocular lens type • L is the axial length of the eyeball in millimeter, determined by using the \"A\" scan \nultrasonography • K is the average corneal curvature, which is determined by keratometry. The image given below shows a biometer.",

Anterior chamber IOLs lie entirely in front of the iris and are supported in the angle \nof the anterior chamber. These are associated with a higher incidence of bullous keratopathy. \nThus, they are currently used only for correction of aphakia in cases where posterior chamber \nIOLs cannot be used (eg: rupture of posterior capsule).",
