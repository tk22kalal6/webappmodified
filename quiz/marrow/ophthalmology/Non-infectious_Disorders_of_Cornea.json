      "correct_answer": "b",
      "explanation": "Band-shaped keratopathy is caused by pathological calcium deposition on the cornea in the form \nof a band. On exam, there is a white band-like formation of calcium across the corneal surface with irregular \nborders and a peripheral clearing of cornea between the calcium deposits and the limbus. The \ncalcium deposition is typically found beneath the epithelial layer within Bowman’s layer but may \nextend into the anterior stroma. Once the visual axis starts to get involved, there will be progressive loss of vision. Recurrence is \ncommon unless the predisposing cause is identified and treated. Local causes such as chronic ocular irritation or inflammatory conditions and systemic \ndiseases that elevate serum calcium levels are the main causes for band-shaped keratopathy. It \ncan rarely have hereditary causes as well. Image given below shows band-shaped keratopathy.",

Band-shaped keratopathy (BSK) is due to calcium deposition, primarily in the form of \nhydroxyapatite, in the epithelial basement membrane, Bowman's layer, and the anterior stroma. \nInitially, these deposits are grey but may become chalky-white as the degeneration progresses. lt typically presents as a band-shaped opacity in the interpalpebral zone with a clear interval \nbetween the ends of the band and the limbus. The condition begins at the periphery and gradually \nprogresses towards the centre. The surface of this opaque band is stippled due to holes in the \ncalcium plaques in the area of nerve canals of Bowman's membrane. Causes of band-shaped keratopathy include local causes such as chronic ocular irritation or \ninflammatory conditions and systemic diseases that elevate serum calcium levels: Treatment: • Medical management- Chelation using topical ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) 1.5–3.0% • Surgical management- Photorefractive keratectomy (PRK) using excimer laser or manual \nsuperficial keratectomy Local causes \nSystemic diseases HyperparathyroidismSarcoid \nosisMultiple myelomaHypop \nhosphatemiaPaget diseaseCh \nronic renal failure Chronic anterior uveitis (espe \ncially inJuvenile Idiopathic A \nrthritis)Interstitial keratitisS \nuperficial keratitisPhthisis bu \nlbiEnd-stage glaucomaSilicon \ne oil left in the aphakic eye",

      "correct_answer": "a",
      "explanation": "The above image shows a dense white opacity, which results from the scarring of more than half \nof the stroma, characteristic of leucoma. Corneal tattooing is a treatment option in patients with corneal opacities, who have lost their \nvision or who do not expect to recover it. It improves cosmetic appearance by altering the white \ncolour of the opacity and blending it to normal eye colour. Depending on the density, corneal opacities are graded as nebula, macula and leucoma. • Nebular corneal opacity (fog or mist): • Hard-to-see corneal scar, due to superficial scars involving Bowman's layer and superficial \nstroma. • Slit-lamp detection is required. • A thin, diffuse nebula covering the pupillary area interferes more with vision than the localised \nleucoma away from the pupillary area. Nebula produces more discomfort due to blurred image \n(irregular astigmatism). 168 \nSold by @itachibot • Macular corneal opacity: • Semi-dense opacity that can be seen with proper illumination. • Due to scarring involving about half the corneal stroma. • Leucomatous corneal opacity (leucoma simplex): • White scar that is easily seen just by looking at the eye. • Due to scarring of more than half of the stroma • Adherent leucoma: • It results when healing occurs after perforation of the cornea with incarceration of iris Secondary changes in corneal opacity which may be seen in long-standing cases include hyaline \ndegeneration, calcareous degeneration, pigmentation and atheromatous ulceration. Treatment: • Keratoplasty is the treatment of choice in leucomatous corneal opacities. • Optical iridectomy may be performed in cases with central adherent leucomas • Phototherapeutic keratectomy (PTK) performed with excimer laser is useful only in superficial \n(nebular) corneal opacities.",

      "correct_answer": "b",
      "explanation": "A 30-year-old individual with corneal changes, as shown above, known as gerontoxon or arcus \nlipoides, may require screening for underlying lipid disorder. Arcus senilis (AS), also known as gerontoxon, arcus lipoides or arcus cornealis, is usually an \nage-related lipid degeneration of the peripheral cornea that forms a light grey or bluish ring. It is \nthe most common peripheral corneal opacity, typically benign, occurring bilaterally and prevalent \namong the elderly. However, when observed in individuals under 50, termed arcus juvenilis, it may indicate \nunderlying lipid disorder and an increased risk of cardiovascular disease, warranting lipid profile \nscreening. Unilateral cases of arcus senilis may indicate contralateral carotid artery stenosis due \nto decreased ophthalmic blood flow on the ipsilateral side, resulting in protection from forming \narcus in the ipsilateral eye. The condition results from the leakage of lipoproteins (phospholipids and cholesterol) from limbal \ncapillaries into the corneal stroma, initiating deposition at the superior and inferior cornea. Over \ntime, the ring progresses circumferentially, sparing a clear corneal zone adjacent to the limbus \ncalled the interval of Vogt. The following opacities and rings can resemble arcus senilis: • Kayser- Fleischer (KF) ring: A dark brown ring caused by the deposition of excess copper in \nDescemet's membrane, classically seen in Wilson's disease. It may also be seen in certain chronic, \ncholestatic liver conditions such as primary biliary cirrhosis. • Limbus sign: Caused by dystrophic calcification, seen as a \"milky precipitate\" at the corneal \nlimbus. It can sometimes be confused with AS in the elderly population. • Pseudo-gerontoxon: A greyish peri-limbal band of superficial scarring adjacent to a previously \ninflamed segment of the limbus resembling AS, seen in vernal keratoconjunctivitis. The image below depicts the Kayser–Fleischer ring and anterior capsule of the crystalline lens \n(Sunflower cataract) seen in Wilson's disease. 171 \nSold by @itachibot",

      "correct_answer": "b",
      "explanation": "The described corneal findings, with his classic history of welding less than 12 hours prior to \npresentation, are suggestive of photophthalmia. Photophthalmia is produced due to exposure to short-wavelength ultraviolet (UV-B) rays. The \ncornea absorbs the majority of UV light (especially 311 to 290 nm). It results in desquamation of \nthe epithelium leading to multiple painful corneal erosions. Causes of of UV keratitis: The symptoms appear characteristically after a latent period of 4- 5 hours of exposure to \nultraviolet light. There is intense burning pain, foreign body sensation, and watering of the eyes. \nThere may be associated marked photophobia and blepharospasm. On slit-lamp examination, \ncorneal epithelium shows a breach in continuity and takes up fluorescein stain. Management comprises cold compresses, lubricant eye drops and bandaging eyes for 24 hours \nwith antibiotic eye ointment and cycloplegic. Avoid local surface topical anaesthesia. Crooke’s \nglass is a prophylactic aid consisting of a spectacle lens combined with metallic oxides to absorb \nultraviolet or infrared rays and should be used by those who are prone to exposure.

Several associations have been identified, which include rigid \ncontact lens wear, chronic eye rubbing, Down's syndrome, atopic disease, Leber's congenital \namaurosis, and connective tissue disease. It is a non-inflammatory disease. With the exception of the significant loss of vision, other classic \nsigns of inflammation are not usually present. The asymmetrical thinning and the highly irregular \ncorneal topography often causes significant myopia and irregular astigmatism. Corneal topography is the primary diagnostic tool for KCN detection.

      "explanation": "Vision correction with spectacles with spherical/toric soft contact lenses is suboptimal and only \napplicable to the early stages of keratoconus, not in the advanced stages. Keratoconus is a progressive, non-inflammatory, bilateral corneal ectasia characterized by \ncone-like steepening due to irregular stromal thinning. This leads to a conical corneal protrusion, \nsignificant vision loss, myopia and irregular astigmatism. The available options for the management of keratoconus are highly dependent on the stage of the \ndisease and its progression. If the disease is stabilized (no progression), the emphasis is given to \ncorrecting the vision. If the disease is progressing, the emphasis is on slowing (arresting) the \nprogression. Treatment options in moderate-to-advanced keratoconus: • Rigid gas-permeable contact lenses and vaulting scleral lenses are the mainstays of vision \ntreatment for moderate to advanced KCN. Their main advantage is the creation of a tear pool \nbetween the lens and the cornea, which naturally neutralizes the ocular aberrations associated \nwith keratoconus. (Option B and C) • Intra-corneal ring segments (INTACS)- small curved PMMA ring or set of rings that are \nimplanted in the cornea to help flatten corneal curvature to improve vision. • Corneal transplantation- Deep anterior lamellar keratoplasty (DALK) and penetrating \nkeratoplasty (PKP) Corneal collagen cross-linking with riboflavin (CXL or C3R) and ultraviolet-A rays arrest the \nprogression of the disease.

Fuchs endothelial dystrophy is a bilateral, slowly progressive, often asymmetric corneal disease. It \nis characterized by deterioration of endothelial cells and development of guttata, which are \nexcrescences of Descemet’s membrane (seen on specular or confocal microscopy). Females are \naffected more than males. It is more common in the 4th decade or later. Endothelial layer dysfunction causes loss of corneal deturgescence, and bilateral oedema of the \nstroma, leading to ocular pain, glare, halos, and decreased visual acuity. Patients have a worse \nvision in the morning because of the eyes being closed during the night causing a buildup of \ncorneal oedema. Stages of Fuch’s endothelial dystrophy: • Stage 1: Central corneal guttata that spreads peripherally • Stage 2: Corneal oedema - beaten metal-like appearance • Stage 3: Bullous keratopathy • Stage 4: Subepithelial scarring and superficial vascularization Treatment: • Conservative option- topical hypertonic (saline sodium chloride 5% drops or 6% ointment) and \nbandage contact lenses. • The definitive treatment is endothelial keratoplasty: Descemet’s stripping endothelial \nkeratoplasty (DSEK/DSAEK) or Descemet membrane Endothelial keratoplasty (DMEK).",

Climatic droplet keratopathy (CDK), alternatively known as oil droplet keratopathy/spheroidal \ndegeneration/Labrador keratopathy, is an acquired corneal degenerative disorder. Clumps of \nvariably sized golden-yellow globules accumulate in the superficial corneal stroma and are \nthought to be derived from photochemical degradation of plasma proteins, by UV radiation. The image shows Labrador keratopathy. 179 \nSold by @itachibot Other options: Option A: Lipid keratopathy involves the accumulation of whitish or yellow fat deposits, mainly \ncholesterol and fatty acids, which begin intracellularly and later move extracellularly due to \nnecrosis of corneal stromal cells. It can be primary (rare, in the cornea free of vascularization) or \nsecondary (common, in the vascularized cornea). Option C: Exposure keratopathy results from lagophthalmos (incomplete eyelid closure), causing \ncorneal dryness despite normal tear production. Causes include neuroparalytic conditions (like \nfacial nerve palsy), reduced muscle tone in Parkinsonism, lid scarring, post-blepharoplasty and \nproptosis. Option D: Neurotrophic keratopathy results from loss of trigeminal nerve innervation to the \ncornea, affecting both sensation and healing. This disruption can cause corneal dryness, \nulceration, exfoliation, and edema.

It is a subtype of peripheral ulcerative \nkeratitis (PUK). It is defined as an idiopathic condition without associated systemic or \nrheumatological conditions and hence is a diagnosis of exclusion. The pathophysiology is thought \nto be due to autoimmune. Clinical features include redness, tearing, and photophobia, but pain is typically the outstanding \nfeature.
