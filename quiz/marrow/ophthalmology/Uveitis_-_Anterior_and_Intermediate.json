      },
      "correct_answer": "d",
      "explanation": "The ciliary body derives its blood supply from the long posterior ciliary artery and anterior ciliary \narteries, which form the major arterial circle at the root of the iris. The ciliary body is a triangular structure that begins at the base of the iris and becomes \ncontinuous with the choroid at the ora serrata. It is approximately 6–6.5 mm in an \nanteroposterior dimension. It consists of an anterior portion called the pars plicata and a posterior portion called the pars \nplana (option A). The pars plicata contains approximately 70 finger-like projections called ciliary \nprocesses, which are covered by the ciliary body epithelium. These processes secrete aqueous \nhumor (option C). The pars plana is the flat part of the ciliary body and ends at the ora serrata. The smooth muscle of the ciliary body is divided into three groups of fibers: • Outer longitudinal portion that attaches anteriorly to the scleral spur and trabecular meshwork \nfibers 339 \nSold by @itachibot • Middle oblique portion • Inner circular portion (responsible for accommodation) (option B)",

Pupillary signs in chronic anterior uveitis is as follows: • Festooned pupil results from the application of mydriatics in segmental posterior synechiae. • Occlusio pupillae results when the pupil is completely occluded due to the organization of the \nexudates across the pupillary area. • Seclusio pupillae due to ring synechiae, that prevent the circulation of aqueous humor from the \nposterior chamber to the anterior chamber.

      "correct_answer": "a",
      "explanation": "344 \nSold by @itachibot Iris bombe formation is due to the development of annular or ring synechiae. Annular posterior/ring synechiae are 360° adhesions of the pupillary margin to the anterior \ncapsule of the lens. They prevent the circulation of aqueous humor from the posterior chamber to \nthe anterior chamber (seclusio pupillae). Thus, the aqueous collects behind the iris and pushes it \nanteriorly leading to iris bombe. This is usually followed by a rise in intraocular pressure. The \nanterior chamber is funnel-shaped when ring synechiae are present. The image below shows iris bombe on slit lamp examination.",

It \nincludes choroiditis, chorioretinitis, retinochoroiditis and neuroretinitis. • Panuveitis Pathological classification divides uveitis into suppurative and nonsuppurative uveitis. \nNonsuppurative uveitis is further classified into nongranulomatous and granulomatous uveitis.
