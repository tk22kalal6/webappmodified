      },
      "correct_answer": "b",
      "explanation": "The hydration level and transparency of the cornea is maintained mainly by the endothelial \ncells of the cornea. The endothelium possesses Na+/K+ ATPase, which keeps the corneal stroma in a relatively \ndehydrated state. This helps maintain corneal transparency. Endothelial cells decrease in number \nwith age. If the cornea becomes overhydrated, it begins to scatter light and gradually begins to \nlose its transparency Other factors contributing to the transparency of the cornea are as follows: • Regular arrangement of corneal lamellae (Maurice theory) • The peculiar refractive index of corneal lamellae (Goldmann theory) • Avascularity of the cornea • A balance between the intraocular pressure (IOP) and swelling pressure The different layers of the cornea are as follows: • Epithelium • Bowman’s membrane • Stroma (substantia propria) • Dua’s layer (pre-Descemet’s layer) • Descemet’s membrane • Endothelium",

      "explanation": "The density of corneal endothelial cells in adults is about 2500–3000 cells/mm². 142 \nSold by @itachibot Variation in corneal endothelial density with age: • At birth- 3,500–4,000 cells/mm2 at birth • Young adults- 2500–3000 cells/mm² • Old age (about 80 years)- 2000 cells/mm² Corneas stored in eye banks are assessed for their quality and viability using a variety of \nparameters. Donor tissues are screened for stress lines, mechanical trauma, scarring, corneal \nedema, and infiltrates that could indicate poor tissue quality. They are further evaluated for \nthickness and endothelial cell density (a surrogate for endothelial function) which are important \ndeterminants of successful graft transplantation. Endothelial cell density (ECD) and morphology are assessed using a specular microscope or by a \nbright-field/phase-contrast light microscope. Note: The number of cells decreases at about 0.6% per year, and the neighboring cells enlarge to \nfill the space as the cells cannot regenerate. At a density of about 500 cells/mm2, corneal edema \ndevelops and transparency is impaired. This is known as critical endothelial density.",

Micro-cornea • Horizontal corneal diameter is 10 mm or less (over 2 years of age) or less than 9 mm (in the \nnewborn). • There may be hypermetropia and a shallow anterior chamber but other dimensions are normal. Megalocornea • Horizontal corneal diameter is 12 mm or more (up to 2 years of age) or 13 mm or more (if age \n&gt;2 years) • There is typically high myopia and astigmatism, but normal corrected visual acuity. • Usually X-linked recessive; 90% of affected individuals are male. Cornea plana • The cornea is flatter than normal, i.e., the radius of curvature is larger. • There is a corresponding reduction in refractive power, resulting in high hypermetropia. Keratectasia • It is characterized by a protuberance between the eyelids caused by a severely opacified, and \nsometimes vascularized, cornea. • It is often associated with raised intraocular pressure as well as intrauterine keratitis. • Usually unilateral Microphthalmos 143 \nSold by @itachibot • Microphthalmia is a condition in which the entire eye is small, with an axial length at least two \nstandard deviations below the mean for age. • It may or may not be associated with ocular dysgenesis.

      "explanation": "The sudden onset and rapid progression of ocular symptoms and ulceration in this patient along \nwith the history of improper contact lens usage are suggestive of a Pseudomonas infection. Pseudomonas aeruginosa is the most common gram-negative organism isolated from corneal \nulcers and is a frequent cause of contact lens–associated keratitis. Other risk factors include \nchlorinated swimming pools, hot tubs, ventilators, nebulizer, and vaporizer solutions, and \nophthalmic solution bottles. Pseudomonas keratitis has a rapid and fulminant course if left untreated and are associated with a \nworse visual prognosis than that caused by most other common bacterial \npathogens. Pseudomonas spp. can cause corneal perforation in just 48 hours.

      "correct_answer": "c",
      "explanation": "The given clinical vignette of the patient presenting with pain, photophobia, and redness of the \neye following trauma by a vegetative matter is suggestive of a fungal corneal ulcer. Fungal corneal ulcer also known as mycotic keratitis is usually caused by trauma from vegetative \nmatter such as branches of trees, leaves and animal tails. Injudicious use of topical steroids and \nantibiotics increases the predisposition to develop secondary fungal keratitis. Mycotic keratitis can be caused by • Filamentous fungi such as Aspergillus and Fusarium • Yeasts such as Candida and cryptococcus • Dimorphic fungi such as Histoplasma and Blastomyces Typically in fungal corneal ulcers, the signs are more prominent than the symptoms. The \nsymptoms of fungal keratitis are similar to that of bacterial ulcers which include pain, \nlacrimation, photophobia, blurred vision, and redness of the eyes. 146 \nSold by @itachibot A typical fungal ulcer has the following signs: • Greyish white looking dry corneal ulcer with rolled out margin. • Feathery finger-like extensions into the corneal stroma under intact epithelium • Wessley ring which is a sterile immune ring that occurs due to the deposition of immune \ncomplexes • Multiple small satellite lesions around the ulcer • Hypopyon: The hypopyon in fungal ulcer is immobile and unsterile unlike bacterial ulcer (sterile \nhypopyon) • Perforation is rare • Corneal vascularization is usually absent. A diagnosis of fungal ulcer is made by a typical history of trauma with vegetative matter followed \nby clinical examination and KOH mount or SDA agar cultures from corneal scrappings. The image below depicts a fungal corneal ulcer with the arrowhead indicating a satellite lesion. Other options: Option A: Anterior uveitis is the inflammation of the uveal tissue from the iris up to the pars \nplicata of the ciliary body. Infectious uveitis can be caused by the exogenous entry of the \norganisms following penetrating injuries, perforation of corneal ulcer, and post-intaocular \noperations. Acute anterior uveitis presents with symptoms of pain, photophobia, lacrimation, blurring of \nvision and redness of the eye. Signs of anterior uveitis include: • Aqueous flare - It is the earliest sign of acute anterior uveitis, it occurs following the leakage of \nprotein particles into the aqueous humor. • Keratic precipitates(KP) - These are pathognomonic for anterior uveitis. They are proteinaceous \ncellular deposits at the back of the cornea arranged in a triangular fashion. These include mutton \nfat KP's as seen in granulomatous uveitis and granular KP's of non granulomatous uveitis. 147 \nSold by @itachibot • Iris nodules: typically occur in granulomatous uveitis. Koppe's nodules are at the pupillary \nborder and Busacca's nodules are situated near the collarette. Option C: Conjunctivitis is the inflammation of the conjunctiva of which the bacterial \nconjunctivitis is the most common. Acute bacterial conjunctivitis is characterized by marked \nconjunctival hyperemia, swelling of the conjunctiva(chemosis), edematous eyelids, sticking \ntogether of lid margins and mucopurulent discharge from the eye. The image shows a patient with bacterial conjunctivitis. Option D: Corneal laceration: Partial corneal laceration or lamellar corneal laceration occurs from \na blunt trauma and is treated by patching and antibiotics.",

Keratitis occurs due to corneal nerve damage by the virus leading to decreased sensation, frequent \ninfections, persistent epithelial defect, thinning and even perforation. Corneal lesions in HZO (zoster keratitis): • Epithelium- superficial punctate keratitis and pseudo-dendritic ulcer • Stroma- nummular keratitis and disciform keratitis Other ocular lesions in herpes zoster: • Uveitis • Episcleritis and scleritis • Conjunctivitis • Acute retinal necrosis • Secondary glaucoma 150 \nSold by @itachibot • Anterior segment necrosis and pthisis bulbi Other options: Option A: Hutchinson’s rule is related to herpes zoster ophthalmicus.

      "explanation": "The history of a patient with contact lens use with swimming in freshwater ponds with the image \ndepicting a ring lesion (stromal infiltrate) makes acanthamoeba keratitis the likely diagnosis. Acanthamoeba keratitis is a rare protozoal infection of the cornea. It is more common in soft \ncontact lens users. The organism exists either as active, motile trophozoites or dormant, \ndouble-walled cysts. Suspicious sources of infection can be swimming or use of the hot tub while \nwearing contact lenses, homemade saline solution to wash contact lenses, exposure to standing \ngroundwater etc. Pain is disproportionate to the degree of keratitis due to perineural invasion. It presents as ring \nlesion (most common), pseudo-dendrites and as a reticular pattern. Diagnosis: • Confocal microscopy - may reveal bright trophozoites with pseudopodia in the basal epithelium \nand double-walled cyst forms 151 \nSold by @itachibot • Histopathology - double-walled cysts are seen on H&amp;E. Other stains \nfor Acanthamoeba include calcofluor white, acridic orange, Giemsa-Wright, Wheatly trichrome or \nperiodic acid-Schiff • Culture - Acanthamoeba can be grown on a bed of E. coli plated on a non-nutrient agar",

      "explanation": "Diphtheria is not a cause of interstitial keratitis. Interstitial keratitis is a non-ulcerating, inflammatory reaction of the corneal stroma that is \ncharacterized by non-suppurative infiltration and often stromal vascularization. The epithelium \nand endothelium are not affected. Scarring due to stromal inflammation and vascularization, in \ninterstitial keratitis, can result in decreased vision. Interstitial keratitis (IK) is a common endpoint of any keratitis that predominantly involves the \ncorneal stroma. So there is a wide range of potential etiologies. Treatment for IK typically involves the use of topical corticosteroids, as well as appropriate \nsystemic medications for the associated systemic disease.
