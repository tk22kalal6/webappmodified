      "correct_answer": "d",
      "explanation": "The given clinical scenario is suggestive of pituitary apoplexy in pregnancy This acute onset event \nis almost always associated with compression at the level of optic chiasma causing heteronymous \nhemianopia (bitemporal hemianopia). Pituitary apoplexy results from hemorrhagic infarction of a pre-existing pituitary adenoma or \nwithin a physiologically enlarged gland, which is well documented in pregnancy. The nasal fibers of each retina cross through the chiasma. Slow-growing microadenomas \ncompress lower nasal optic fibers causing superior temporal quadrantanopia initially, before \nprogressing to bitemporal hemianopia. However, an abrupt infarction or hemorrhage of a \npre-existing pituitary adenoma will lead to rapid progression of the visual defect. Heteronymous hemianopia is the loss of half of the visual field on different sides in both eyes. It is \nseparated into two categories: • Binasal hemianopia – the loss of the fields surrounding the nose • Bitemporal hemianopia – the loss of the fields closest to the temples. Common causes of bitemporal hemianopia due to central chiasmal lesions are as follows: • Suprasellar aneurysms • Tumors of the pituitary gland 497 \nSold by @itachibot • Craniopharyngioma • Suprasellar meningioma • Glioma of the third ventricle Other visual defects according to the site of the lesion are as follows:",

      "correct_answer": "d",
      "explanation": "Congruous homonymous hemianopia is most suggestive of a lesion in the occipital cortex. Homonymous hemianopia involves vision loss on the same side of the visual field in both eyes. \nThis type of visual field loss is suggestive of a lesion posterior to the optic chiasma in the visual \npathway. Complete homonymous hemianopia involves the complete visual hemifields of both eyes and can \noccur with any large enough lesion posterior to the optic chiasma. Visual field examination alone \ncannot further localize the lesion in such cases. 498 \nSold by @itachibot Incomplete homonymous hemianopia is due to smaller lesions in the visual pathway posterior to \nthe optic chiasm. They are further divided into congruous and incongruous depending on the \nextent to which the defects in the two half fields match each other exactly. Because of a relative disorder among axon bundles in the immediate post-chiasmal region, \ndiseases in this location produce rather incongruent lesions. More posteriorly, the axon bundles of the corresponding areas of the two hemifields are more \nclosely aligned and hence, lesions of the occipital cortex produce congruous homonymous \nhemianopia while incongruous homonymous hemianopia is more likely seen with optic tract \nlesions.",

      "explanation": "The given clinical scenario is suggestive of cortical blindness with visual anosognosia (Anton \nsyndrome).

Cortical blindness is usually associated with bilateral occipital infarcts where it is supplied by the \nposterior cerebral arteries and these infarcts usually involve both the primary visual cortex and \nvisual association area. It is secondary to damage to the visual pathways posterior to the lateral \ngeniculate nuclei; anterior visual pathways are intact. Visual field defects can vary depending on \nthe extent and location of the infarct. Direct and consensual reflexes are present in both eyes in cortical blindness as pupillary light \nreflex fibers exit the visual pathway at the level of the superior colliculus. They exit the optic tract \nbefore the lateral geniculate body (LGB) to reach the center for pupillary light reflex- pretectal \nnucleus at the midbrain.

Marcus Gunn pupil also known as relative afferent pupillary defect (RAPD) is the earliest \nsign of optic nerve disease as seen in optic nerve neuritis or primary open-angle glaucoma(POAG). RAPD is caused due to a defect in the afferent pathway (optic nerve) of the pupillary light reflex in \none eye. It is diagnosed by the swinging flashlight test where the flashlight is swung to and fro, and the \npupillary response is observed. Normally, both pupils constrict when any one eye is stimulated \n(due to direct and consensual light reflex). In the presence of RAPD, both \npupils will abnormally dilate when the affected eye is stimulated. This paradoxical response of the \npupil to light is called Marcus Gunn pupil.

Among the given options, 1% pilocarpine and \n0.1% pilocarpine can be used to differentiate fixed dilated pupil. Mydriasis due to neurologic origin (3rd nerve palsy) responds readily to 1% pilocarpine, whereas \nthere will be no response if the dilation is due to anticholinergic causes. Pupillary constriction \nto 0.1% pilocarpine diagnoses Adie's pupil (due to denervation hypersensitivity). Application of \n0.1% pilocarpine shows no response in other conditions or in the normal eye. Example: A person presenting with dilated pupil following accidental application or inadvertent \nrubbing of atropine or antimuscarinic alkaloids from wild plants into the eye will not constrict in \nresponse to topical application of 1% Pilocarpine. But the patient showing dilation due to 3rd \nnerve palsy shows pupillary constriction in response to pupillary instillation of 1% pilocarpine.

Causes of bilateral involvement include cervical spine injuries and autonomic diabetic \nneuropathy. Painful Horner syndrome, especially of acute onset, should raise the possibility of carotid \ndissection. Clinical features • Mild ptosis (usually 1–2 mm) as a result of weakness of Müller muscle • Anisocoria is accentuated in dim light • Pupillary constriction to light and near stimuli is normal. • Hypochromic heterochromia (lighter color iris on affected side); in congenital cases. 505 \nSold by @itachibot • Mild ptosis (Mullers muscle is affected) • Reduced ipsilateral sweating (only if the lesion is below the superior cervical ganglion) Pharmacological tests • Hydroxyamphetamine and adrenaline may be used to differentiate a preganglionic from a \npostganglionic lesion. • Phenylepherine (1%) • Result: In an established (10 days) postganglionic lesion, the Horner pupil will dilate and ptosis \nmay be temporarily relieved. A central or preganglionic Horner pupil and a normal pupil will not \ndilate or will dilate minimally. • Explanation: In postganglionic Horner's syndrome, the dilator pupillae muscle develops \ndenervation hypersensitivity to adrenergic neurotransmitters due to its dysfunctional local motor \nnerve. • Apraclonidine (0.5% or 1.0%) • Result: A Horner pupil will dilate, but a normal pupil is essentially unaffected. • Explanation: Alpha-1 receptors are upregulated in the denervated dilator pupillae. • Cocaine (4%) is instilled into both eyes • Result: The normal pupil will dilate, but the Horner pupil will not. • Explanation: Cocaine blocks the re-uptake of noradrenaline secreted at the postganglionic nerve \nending, which accumulates and causes dilatation of a normal pupil. In Horner's syndrome, there \nis no noradrenaline being secreted, so cocaine has no effect.",

      "explanation": "The cell body of the second-order neuron in the sympathetic pathway for the pupil lies at the \nciliospinal center of Budge (C8–T1). The sympathetic pathway to the iris muscles consists of a chain of three neurons: • The first neuron arises from the hypothalamus along the brain stem to synapse in \nthe intermediolateral column of the spinal cord—the ciliospinal center of Budge (C8-T1). • From here (C8-T1), the second-order neuron arises. This joins the cervical sympathetic chain and \nsynapses at the superior cervical ganglion. • The third-order neuron arises from the superior cervical ganglion and travels through the \ncavernous sinus along with the internal carotid artery. • Sympathetic fibers join the ophthalmic division of the trigeminal nerve and pass through the \nciliary ganglion to the nasociliary and short ciliary nerves. 506 \nSold by @itachibot",

      "explanation": "Simultaneous lesion in both sympathetic and parasympathetic supply of the eye leads to mid-sized \npupil that doesn’t react to light. Pupillary dilation is achieved by sympathetic innervation of dilator pupillae. Therefore, any lesion \nof the sympathetic supply of the pupil leads to constricted pupil. Pupillary constriction is a parasympathetic function. Lesions in this pathway leads to dilated pupil \nand failure to constrict. A mid-sized unreactive pupil due to a lesion of both parasympathetic and sympathetic supplies is \nseen in aneurysms of the internal carotid artery within the cavernous sinus.",

      "explanation": "The most common feature seen in diabetic oculomotor palsy among the given options is ptosis. In the anatomical arrangement of the nerve fibers of the 3rd cranial nerve, the fibers controlling \nthe pupillary reflex are present superficially and are thus spared from diabetic ischemia-induced \ninjury which starts from the central nerve fibres. Thus, pupil sparing is commonly seen in diabetic \npatients. 507 \nSold by @itachibot The etiology of diabetic neuropathy is hyperglycemia-induced damage to nerve cells and neuronal \nischemic change due to microvascular angiopathy. Involvement of the third cranial nerve is most common and it often presents with early features of \nptosis and diplopia with pupil sparing. The involvement of levator palpebrae superioris muscle of the eyelid manifests as ptosis and the \ninvolvement of extraocular muscles such as medial rectus,inferior rectus and inferior oblique \npresents as opthalmoplegia with diplopia. All the muscles mentioned above are supplied by the \nOcculomotor nerve. Note: Aneurysm of the posterior communicating artery is an important cause of isolated third \nnerve palsy with involvement of the pupil. This is because the aneurysm impinges on the \nsuperficial pupil nerve fibres of the 3rd cranial nerve.",

      "correct_answer": "c",
      "explanation": "Ptosis and double vision with no other features suggest an acquired, isolated 3rd nerve palsy with \npupillary sparing. This is seen in ischemic conditions such as diabetes. The vasoneurium supplies the nerve from outside to inside. As the somatic fibres are located in \nthe inner part of the nerve, these fibres are affected more in the setting of ischemia. The \nparasympathetic pupillary fibres which run on the outside can remain unaffected (resulting in \npupillary sparing). In compressive lesions, the parasympathetic fibres are affected before any \ndisruption of the motor fibres. So pupillary sparing is not seen. Isolated 3rd nerve palsy Causes • Microvascular disease associated with systemic risk factors such as hypertension and diabetes is \nthe most common cause of third nerve palsy. • Aneurysm of the posterior communicating artery at its junction with the internal carotid, both \ndirect and secondary to subdural hematoma with uncal herniation. • Episodic- migraine, compression, ischemia, and alterations in intracranial pressure • Miscellaneous- tumour and inflammatory diseases such as syphilis, Lyme disease, and \nsarcoidosis; giant cell arteritis; and vasculitis associated with collagen vascular disorders. Signs • Profound ptosis due to the weakness of the levator muscle • Abduction and depression in the primary position (\"down and out\") • Normal abduction as the lateral rectus is intact • Limited adduction due to medial rectus weakness • Limited elevation due to the weakness of the superior rectus and inferior oblique 508 \nSold by @itachibot",

The nucleus of the sixth (abducens or abducent) nerve lies at the mid-level of the pons. Nuclear lesion: A nuclear sixth nerve lesion also causes the failure of horizontal gaze towards the \nside of the damage due to the involvement of the adjacent horizontal gaze center (paramedian \npontine reticular formation).
