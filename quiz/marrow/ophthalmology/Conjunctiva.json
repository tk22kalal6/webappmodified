      "correct_answer": "a",
      "explanation": "Moraxella species, a type of gram-negative diplobacilli, are involved in causing angular \nconjunctivitis which is a type of chronic conjunctivitis. Angular conjunctivitis is a chronic type of conjunctivitis where there is inflammation of the \nconjunctiva at the lid margins and the inner and outer canthi of the eyes with red, scaly, \nexcoriated, macerated and fissured skin at the canthi. This is because of the proteolytic enzymes \nsecreted by the Moraxella species. Patients with angular conjunctivitis usually experience eye irritation, a burning sensation and \ncollection of dirty-white, foamy discharge at the angles. These patients can also have associated \nblepharitis and papillary and follicular conjunctivitis. Causative organisms are Moraxella lacunata, Moraxella axenfeld and Staphylococcus aureus (Rare \ncause). The source of infection is typically the nasal tract or the nasal discharge of patients with \nangular conjunctivitis. The infection spreads from the nasal cavity to the eyes \nthrough contaminated hands or handkerchiefs. Treatment includes oxytetracycline 1% ointment \nfor 10 to 14 days, and zinc oxide as it inhibits proteolytic enzymes. The image given below shows the eye of a patient infected with angular conjunctivitis. 99 \nSold by @itachibot Other options: Option B: Haemophilus influenzae causes acute conjunctivitis. Option C: Adenovirus is the most common cause of viral conjunctivitis and it most commonly \ncauses follicular conjunctivitis, pharyngoconjunctival fever, and epidemic keratoconjunctivitis.

      "explanation": "The of a child with irritation and redness of the eye with no previous vaccination records is \nsuggestive of a case of membranous conjunctivitis and among the given options, Corynebacterium \ndiphtheriae is the most likely etiological agent. Membranous conjunctivitis presents with irritation and redness of the eye and is characterized by \nthe formation of a greyish-white membrane that bleeds on peeling. Vaccines are routinely used \nto prevent diphtheria infection and hence, unvaccinated status increases his susceptibility to the \nbacteria. Moreover, the bacteria thrive in crowded populations and poor hygienic surroundings, \nhence a background of low socioeconomic context, such as an orphanage, acts as a risk factor in \nthis case. This condition is associated with the formation of fibrinous exudates on the surface and into the \nsubstance of the conjunctival epithelium. The causes include beta-hemolytic streptococci, \nStreptococcus pneumonia, Haemophilus aegyptius, Corynebacterium diphtheria, and Neisseria \ngonorrhea The image given below shows the eye of a patient with pseudomembranous conjunctivitis.

This condition is commonly caused by adenovirus serotypes 3, 4, and \n7. Pharyngoconjunctival fever is an acute and highly infectious illness characterized by fever, \npharyngitis, acute follicular conjunctivitis, and regional lymphoid hyperplasia with tender, \nenlarged preauricular adenopathy.

A subconjunctival hemorrhage is also called subconjunctival ecchymosis. It is due to the rupture \nof small blood vessels and can occur spontaneously in elders with systolic hypertension or after \nlocal trauma. The condition is commonly associated with a benign course but, if the posterior \nlimit of the hemorrhage is not seen, one should check for the base of the skull fracture.

A history of trekking, along with chronic sunlight exposure as a farmer, acts as a \nrisk factor because it increases the exposure to the stronger UV radiation in the mountains. Pinguecula has a fatty appearance and is usually bilateral. They are more often located \nnasally than temporally. It has horizontally oriented areas of bulbar conjunctival thickening that \nadjoin the limbus in the palpebral fissure area. They are associated with a 2- to 3-fold increased \nincidence of age-related macular degeneration. It is seen in most eyes by 70 years of age and in \nalmost all by 80 years of age.
