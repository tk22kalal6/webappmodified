      "correct_answer": "b",
      "explanation": "Lamina fusca is the innermost layer of the sclera. Lamina fusca faces the choroid. It is the transition zone between the sclera and the choroid. It \nconsists of a delicate meshwork of elastic fibres, fibrocytes and melanocytes, traversed by long \nposterior ciliary nerves and vessels. Layers of the sclera from outside to inside include episclera, sclera proper, and lamina fusca, in \nthat order.",

      "correct_answer": "d",
      "explanation": "The lateral limbus is the least likely site to be involved in a traumatic scleral rupture. Traumatic scleral rupture, or globe rupture, occurs after blunt-force trauma. It usually occurs due \nto the compression force of the trauma. It therefore likely occurs at the insertion of rectus \nmuscles, at the equator, or in an area parallel to the limbus opposite from the site of the impact. \nRupture at the site of trauma, in this case lateral limbus, is rare. The major signs of scleral rupture are conjunctival edema and subconjunctival hemorrhage, \nhyphema, ocular hypotony, impairment or dislocation of the lens, vitreous hemorrhage, and \nretinal detachment.",

      "correct_answer": "c",
      "explanation": "High intraocular pressure leads to the thinning of the outer tunics of the eyeball such as \ncornea and sclera, thereby resulting in their ectasia (bulging) which is known as \nstaphyloma. Ciliary and equatorial staphylomas are most commonly associated with glaucoma. Staphyloma is an abnormal protrusion of the uveal tissue through a weak and thin portion of \nthe cornea or sclera.

It is commonly associated with rheumatoid arthritis. Scleromalacia perforans is a specific type of progressive scleral thinning without inflammation. \nDespite the term 'scleromalacia perforans', perforation is extremely rare as the integrity of the \nsclera is maintained by a thin layer of fibrous tissue.

Anterior scleritis affects the sclera in \nfront of the equator, while posterior scleritis affects the sclera behind the equator of the eye. \nAnterior scleritis is further classified into the following types: • Non-necrotizing • Diffuse: The most common variety • Nodular: Scleral nodules are present. Annular scleritis is a variant in which the scleral nodules \nare arranged in a ring around the limbus. • Necrotizing • With inflammation • Without inflammation: Also known as scleromalacia perforans.

Scleromalacia perforans is a type of anterior scleritis. It typically occurs in elderly women with \nrheumatoid arthritis (systemic disease).
