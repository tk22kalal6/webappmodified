The image is clearest or least confusing as point D, the circle of least \nconfusion. When light passes through a regularly astigmatic surface(surface with toric curvature), vertical \nand horizontal rays converge at different points. The distance between the points of convergence (focus) of the vertical and horizontal rays is called \nthe focal interval of strum. (distance between points B and F). The circle of least confusion/ circle \nof diffusion lies at the mid-point of this interval. For the given Sturm's conoid, • At point A, a horizontal oval is formed because vertical rays converge more rapidly than \nhorizontal rays. • At point B, vertical rays come to a focus, while horizontal rays are still converging; so, it will be a \nhorizontal straight line. • At points C, D, and E, the vertical rays are diverging and horizontal rays are still converging. 37 \nSold by @itachibot • At point D, the vertical rays have diverged as much as the horizontal rays have converged; so, we \nget a perfect circle called the circle of least confusion. • At point E, a vertical oval is formed. • At point F, a vertical straight line is formed • At point G and beyond, both rays are diverging, and we always get a vertical oval/prolate ellipse.",

Chromophore regeneration: • All-trans retinAL is converted to all-trans-retinOL. 41 \nSold by @itachibot • All-trans-retinOL gets transported by interphotoreceptor retinoid-binding protein (IRBP) to the \nretinal pigment epithelial cells, where it is reconstituted into the 11-cis retinal isoform.",

      "correct_answer": "c",
      "explanation": "In deuteranomaly, the perception of green color is defective. It is the most common disorder of \ncolor vision. Monochromacy: Only one of the three primary colors (red, blue, or green) can be appreciated. Dichromacy: Two primary colors are appreciated. (anopia = absent). • Protanopia: Red color is not perceived. • Deuteranopia: Green color is not perceived. • Tritanopia: Blue color is not perceived. Trichromacy: All the three primary colors are appreciated, but one of them can be defective \n(anomaly = defective). • Protanomaly: Red color perception is defective. • Deuteranomaly: Green color perception is defective. • Tritanomaly: Blue color perception is defective. Achromatopsia: No color perception due to the absence of cones. It may also occur in the lesion of \narea V4 or V8 of the visual cortex. 45 \nSold by @itachibot",

      "correct_answer": "b",
      "explanation": "The angle subtended by the optotype (individual letters on the chart) on the second line of \nSnellen’s chart in the above case would be 30 minutes of arc. The second line on Snellen’s chart corresponds to a distance of 36 meters. When viewed from a \n6m distance, it is denoted as visual acuity 6/36. Where, • The numerator (6) denotes the distance from which the patient is actually viewing it • The denominator (36) denotes the distance at which it should be ideally viewed. It denotes the \ndistance at which each stroke of the letter would subtend the minimum angle of resolution (MAR) \nof one minute of arc. MAR = 1/Visual acuity Each letter is shaped such that it can be placed in a square, the sides of which are five times the \nbreadth of individual limbs of the letters. Hence, the angle subtended by the optotype= MAR x 5 For eg: At exactly 6 meters distance from the patient, the letters on the 6/6 line shall subtend 5 \nminutes of arc (such that the individual limbs of the letters subtend 1 minute of arc). The equation to calculate the minimum angle of resolution (MAR) is given as follows: For the given question, MAR = 1/ 6/36 MAR = 36/6 MAR = 6 minutes of arc Hence, the angle subtended by the entire letter is 6 × 5 = 30 minutes of arc. 47 \nSold by @itachibot",

Aniseikonia is defined as the difference in image size between the two eyes and can lead to \ndisturbances in stereopsis. The tolerable limit of aniseikonia is 5–8%. It is reduced with contact \nlens (8%) compared to glasses (25–30%) in aphakia. However, the percentage of aniseikonia is least with an intraocular lens (IOL) (1–3%), thus \nsecondary IOL implantation is the most preferred management of unilateral aphakia.",

      "correct_answer": "c",
      "explanation": "The Floccular nucleus of the cerebellum controls ocular saccades. A saccade is a rapid ballistic movement to change the point of fixation. It is the fastest of all eye \nmovements and is initiated by the contralateral frontal lobe. Smooth pursuit is a slow tracking \nmovement to keep the target on the fovea. It is controlled by the ipsilateral parieto-occipital lobe. Following an object from the right to left is left pursuit and is controlled by ipsilateral (left) \nparieto-occipital lobe, and the corrective movement is a saccade (in this case, left to right) termed \nright saccade and is controlled by the contralateral (left) frontal lobe. The floccular nucleus is found in the lobule HX of the cerebellar vermis. Its functions include \nmatching pulse-step, gaze holding, and sustained smooth pursuit. Bilateral lesions of the flocculus \nresult in the following: • Post-saccadic drift- saccadic movements do not stop, but there is a brief, several hundred \nmilliseconds drift of the eyes after each saccade. • Saccadic pursuit- smooth tracking is replaced by simultaneous rapid jerking motions of the eye \nto follow an object toward the ipsilateral visual field. • Gaze-evoked nystagmus- impaired ability to hold the eyes in the eccentric position, resulting in \ngaze-evoked nystagmus towards the affected side of the cerebellum.

The ease with which the aqueous humor leaves the eye is called an aqueous outflow facility. • The outflow facility is measured using tonography. • The normal range is between 0.22–0.28 µL/min/mmHg. • A juxtacanalicular portion of the trabecular meshwork is the primary limiting factor for the \noutflow facility. • Uveoscleral outflow accounts for 10% of the total aqueous outflow facility. • Aqueous outflow facility decreases with aging. • Trabecular outflow facility is reduced in glaucoma. • Laser trabeculoplasty reduces intraocular pressure (IOP) in open-angle glaucoma by increasing \nthe trabecular outflow facility. 49 \nSold by @itachibot Myopia and Hypermetropia",
