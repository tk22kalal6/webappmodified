      "explanation": "The optic nerve (2nd cranial nerve) passes through the optic canal, not the superior orbital fissure. Anatomy of the orbit Orbit is a pear-shaped cavity, the stalk of which is the optic canal. The volume of the orbit is 30 cc. The image below shows the bones forming the orbit.

      "question": "Question 2: You are volunteering in a medical camp held in an orphanage. You see a kid with hypoplasia \nof the zygoma and mandible along with antimongoloid slant of palpebral fissures as shown \nbelow. These findings correspond to which of the following syndrome?",
      "options": {

      "correct_answer": "b",
      "explanation": "The given findings correspond to Treacher–Collins syndrome. Treacher–Collins syndrome/Mandibulofacial dysostosis refers to a condition resulting from the \nhypoplasia of the zygoma and mandible. Ocular features: • Indistinct inferior orbital margin • Coloboma of the lower eyelid • Anti-mongoloid slant of palpebral fissures Systemic features • Macrostomia with a high-arched palate • External ear deformity • Bird-like face The image below shows features of Treacher–Collins syndrome. Craniofacial dysostosis/Crouzon syndrome refers to the premature closure of the coronal and \nsagittal sutures (brachycephaly—clover-leaf skull) associated with maxillary hypoplasia. Ocular \nassociations include the following: • Blue sclera • Megalocornea • Aniridia • Glaucoma • Cataract • Ectopia lentis • Optic nerve hypoplasia 412 \nSold by @itachibot The image below shows a baby with Crouzon syndrome. Apert syndrome is the most severe form of craniosynostosis, involving premature closure of \nmultiple cranial sutures (acrocephaly), along with syndactyly of the fingers and toes.

      "correct_answer": "d",
      "explanation": "The given clinical scenario plus the supportive CT image showing the \"hanging drop sign\" is \nsuggestive of a blowout fracture of the orbital wall. Blow-out fractures are isolated comminunited fractures caused from direct trauma to the orbit \nthat results in a backward displacement of the eyeball and an increase in the intraorbital pressure. \nThis causes a fracture at the weakest point of the orbital wall which is usually the posteromedial 413 \nSold by @itachibot portion of the maxillary bone in the orbital floor. The second most common site for orbital \nblowout fracture is the medial wall of the orbit. The patient with blow out fracture usually presents with immediate periorbital edema and blood \nextravasation in and around the orbit. Proptosis of the eyeball secondary to orbital edema or \nhemorrhage with paresthesia along the infraorbital nerve are also very common. Imaging by a plain x-ray in water's view or by CT demonstrates depression of bony fragments and \norbital contents herniating through the orbital floor into the maxillary antrum. This is called as \nthe \"hanging drop sign\" or \"tear drop sign\". Definitive treatment is by surgical repair 10-14 days after injury with initial supportive \nmanagement with analgesics and antibiotics. Le fort fracture- Is the term used to describe different types of maxillary fractures.",

      "correct_answer": "d",
      "explanation": "The most common site of an orbital blowout fracture is the floor of the orbit. Blow-out fractures are isolated comminunited fractures caused from direct trauma to the orbit \nthat results in a backward displacement of the eyeball and an increase in the intraorbital pressure. \nThis causes a fracture at the weakest point of the orbital wall which is usually the posteromedial \nportion of the maxillary bone in the orbital floor. The second most common site for orbital blowout fracture is the medial wall of the orbit (Option \nA). The fractures of the roof(Option C) are relatively rare and most often do not require any \ntreatment.The lateral wall(Option B) of the orbit is the most solid orbital wall and a fracture here \nis usually seen in injuries with extensive facial damage. The patient with blow out fracture usually presents with immediate periorbital edema and blood \nextravasation in and around the orbit.

      },
      "correct_answer": "d",
      "explanation": "Severe ocular damage associated with a \"blowout\" fracture is rare. This is because a \"blowout fracture\" is nature’s way of protecting the globe from injury. Clinical features of blow out fracture are as follows: • Periorbital edema • Paresthesia and anesthesia in the distribution of the infraorbital nerve (lower lid, cheek, side of \nthe nose, upper lip, and upper teeth) • Emphysema of the eyelids-more frequent with medial wall fractures 415 \nSold by @itachibot • Proptosis-seen initially due to orbital edema and hemorrhage. • After about 10 days, as the edema decreases, the eyeball sinks backward and somewhat \ninferiorly, resulting in enophthalmos and mechanical ptosis. • Double diplopia- diplopia in upward as well as downward gaze",

      "explanation": "The X-ray finding seen in an orbital blowout fracture is hanging drop/tear-drop sign. Hanging drop/tear-drop sign is characteristic of an orbital \"blow-out\" fracture, which represents \nthe orbital contents herniating through the floor of the orbit into the maxillary antrum. The most \nuseful projection for detecting an orbital floor fracture is Water’s view. The optimal time for surgery following a blowout fracture is 10–14 days. Indications for surgery in a blowout fracture are as follows: • Diplopia not resolving significantly in the early days after trauma • A fracture with a large herniation of tissues into the antrum • Incarceration of tissues in the fracture, resulting in globe retraction and increased applanation \ntension on attempted upward gaze • Enophthalmos greater than 2 mm",

It occurs due to \nthe striking of the contracted pupillary margin against the crystalline lens. • Rosette cataract - It is the most typical form of concussion cataract. • Commotio retinae (Berlin’s edema) - It manifests as milky white cloudiness involving a \nconsiderable area of the posterior pole with a \"cherry-red spot\" at foveola.",
