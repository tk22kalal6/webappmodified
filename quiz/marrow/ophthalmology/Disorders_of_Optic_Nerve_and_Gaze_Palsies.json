Ocular movements \nare painful in retrobulbar neuritis and painless in papillitis and neuroretinitis. Glowing sensations \nknown as phosphenes may be induced with sound or movement.

It is commonly associated with multiple sclerosis (MS). Option A: Pulfrich’s phenomenon is an illusion of depth perception. It is seen in MS. Option C: Lhermitte’s sign refers to passive neck flexion causing an electric shock-like sensation \nradiating to the spine and shoulders.

      "correct_answer": "c",
      "explanation": "The given clinical vignette of a patient presenting with decreased visual acuity and a history of \ntransverse myelitis which is treated with steroids is indicative of Neuromyelitis optica (NMO). Neuromyelitis optica also known as Devic's disease is an autoimmune demyelinating disease in \nwhich antibodies are formed against Aquaporin 4 present in the cell membranes of Astrocytes. It \nis characterized by the findings of unilateral or bilateral optic neuritis developing within a few \nweeks of transverse myelitis(demyelination of the spinal cord). The disease may be monophasic or \nrecurrent. Diagnostic Criteria for Neuromyelitis Optica Spectrum Disorder (NMOSD): Diagnostic Criteria for NMOSD associated with AQP4-IgG • At least 1 core clinical characteristic • A positive test for AQP4-IgG using the best available detection method (cell-based assay) • Exclusion of alternative diagnoses Core Clinical Characteristics: • Optic neuritis is usually bilateral and causes severe visual loss. • Acute myelitis- may be severe, transverse and typically longitudinally extensive involving three \nor more contiguous vertebral segments. • Area postrema syndrome: episodes of otherwise unexplained hiccups or nausea or vomiting • Acute brainstem syndrome • Symptomatic narcolepsy associated with NMOSD-typical diencephalic MRI lesions For acute cases of NMO, high-dose glucocorticoids or plasma exchange is used. Mycophenolate \nmofetil, rituximab, and glucocorticoids with azathioprine are used for prophylaxis against \nrelapses. The FDA has approved satralizumab, a humanized IgG2 monoclonal antibody, for the treatment \nof NMO spectrum disorder with AQP4 antibody positivity. Eculizumab, a complement inhibitor, and inebilizumab, a B-cell depletion agent, are two more \nnew drugs that have recently been approved for use in NMO attack prevention. 524 \nSold by @itachibot A history of transverse myelitis with optic neuritis(decreased visual acuity) rules out Multiple \nsclerosis(option D). It is an autoimmune inflammatory and demyelinating disease of the CNS that \naffects both upper motor neurons (UMN) and lower motor neurons (LMN) with involvement of \nsensory system, ocular system and bowel and bladder function. Ocular manifestations of MS \ninclude Optic neuritis(usually retrobulbar)- decreased visual acuity, internuclear ophthalmoplegia \nand nystagmus.",

Tobacco amblyopia is caused by excessive smoking and chewing of tobacco. The toxic agent \ninvolved is cyanide found in tobacco. It is characterized by bilateral and gradually progressive \nimpairment of central vision. The classic visual field defect is a centrocecal scotoma, often \ninvolving both the blind spot and the macula. Option B: Ethanol amblyopia is similar to tobacco amblyopia but often presents with peripheral \nneuritis and a \"central scotoma\". Option C: Methanol amblyopia often results in complete blindness.

Idiopathic intracranial hypertension (pseudotumor cerebri) is a diagnosis of exclusion. \nObstructive, compressive, and infiltrative CNS lesions must be excluded by neuroimaging studies. \nPapilledema, although present in 90% of the patients, is not necessary for diagnosis.

Other causes of down-beat nystagmus: • Drugs (phenytoin, lithium, barbiturates, carbamazepine) • Wernicke's encephalopathy • Demyelinating disorders Acquired nystagmus can be attributed to disturbances of the three mechanisms that normally \nensure steady gaze—visual fixation, the vestibulo-ocular reflex, and the mechanism that makes it \npossible to hold the eyes at an eccentric eye position (e.g. far-right gaze).

      "explanation": "Fracture of the temporal bone causes vestibular injury resulting in a horizontal nystagmus with \nslow phase towards the affected side and fast phase towards the opposite side. Peripheral vestibular nystagmus occurs in lesions of the labyrinth or vestibular nerve. Normally, \nthere is tonic input to the brainstem vestibular nuclei from the periphery. Loss of the tonic input \nfrom the left vestibular nerve leads to deviation of the eyes towards the left side, which is the slow \nphase of the nystagmus.

      "explanation": "In internuclear ophthalmoplegia (INO) the lesion is at the medial longitudinal fasciculus (MLF). In INO, there is impaired adduction on the ipsilateral side of the lesion, and nystagmus on \nabduction on the contralateral side. When the gaze is initiated in the motor cortex, the horizontal \ngaze center or the paramedian pontine reticular formation (PPRF) generates the eye movements. The PPRF has two outputs. The first is to the ipsilateral 6th cranial nerve nucleus which causes \nabduction of the ipsilateral eye. The second output is to the contralateral MLF which sends an \nimpulse to the contralateral 3rd cranial nerve nucleus causing contralateral adduction. These two \noutputs from PPRF lead to conjugate movement of the eyes to the same side. 530 \nSold by @itachibot Therefore, a lesion in the right MLF leads to failure of the right eye adduction. The left eye, \nhowever, abducts normally. This is called internuclear ophthalmoplegia. The following image shows the pathway for horizontal eye movements as described above.",

      "correct_answer": "a",
      "explanation": "Horizontal gaze palsy can occur due to a lesion in parapontine reticular formation (PPRF). Horizontal gaze: • It involves 2 muscles- the ipsilateral lateral rectus and the contralateral medial rectus. • Center for this pathway is parapontine reticular formation (PPRF). • From here, they move to the ipsilateral 6th nerve nucleus. 531 \nSold by @itachibot • Next, they pass through the medial longitudinal fasciculus (MLF) to the contralateral medial \nrectus subnucleus. Lesions affecting the abducens nuclei will also cause ipsilateral horizontal gaze palsy, because of \ndamage to motor neurons and internuclear neurons originating from the nuclei. Lesions involving \nthe PPRF will lead to horizontal gaze palsy, as PPRF acts as a relay centre that connects the \nfrontal eye fields in the cerebral cortex to the abducens nuclei. Conjugate horizontal gaze palsy \ncan also be caused by lesion(s) involving both the abducens motor fibres and the MLFs preceding \nthe abducens nucleus. Bilateral horizontal gaze palsy will be caused if lesion(s) involve both \nabducens nuclei or bilateral PPRF. Isolated damage to the MLFs will cause the classic INO where eye abduction is preserved, \nhowever, the ipsilateral eye will not be able to be adducted on conjugate horizontal gaze. Conjugate eye movements • Binocular movements in which the eyes move synchronously and symmetrically in the same \ndirection. • Main types • Saccades: They are fast movements controlled by the contralateral frontal lobe. • Pursuits: They are slow following movements controlled by the ipsilateral occipital lobe. Image: The Horizontal gaze pathway Lesions in this pathway • Horizontal gaze palsy: Due to lesion in the PPRF of the same side • Internuclear ophthalmoplegia (INO): Caused by lesion in the medial longitudinal fasciculus \n(MLF) • One and a half syndrome: Caused by lesions in both MLF and PPRF of the same side Vertical gaze palsy Center is located in the rostral interstitial nucleus of the dorsal midbrain (riMLF). 532 \nSold by @itachibot The important types of vertical gaze palsy are as follows: • Parinaud's syndrome: Upgaze palsy • Steel–Richardsons syndrome: Downgaze palsy",
