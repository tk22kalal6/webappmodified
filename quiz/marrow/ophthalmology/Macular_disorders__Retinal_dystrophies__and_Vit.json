      "question": "Question 1: A 25-year-old artist visits an art gallery. A painting of checkered squares appears distorted \nonly to him, as shown below. He decides to go see an ophthalmologist who after initial \nevaluation, suggests an FFA. The FFA shows a characteristic smoke stack appearance. \nBreakdown of which of the following barriers is responsible for his condition?",

      "correct_answer": "b",
      "explanation": "The given clinical scenario with a characteristic smoke stack pattern on FFA is suggestive of a \ndiagnosis of central serous retinopathy. In CSR, the outer blood-retinal barrier is disrupted. CSR is the serous detachment of the neurosensory retina with focal and multifocal areas of \nleakage at the level of the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE), mainly affecting the macular area. \nThat is why the patient who is usually a young male presents with macular symptoms such as \nblurring of central vision, metamorphopsia. The blood-retina barrier (BRB) is composed of inner and outer barriers. The outer BRB refers to \nthe barrier formed at the retinal pigment epithelial (RPE) cell layer and regulates the movement of \nsolutes and nutrients from the choroid to the sub-retinal space. By contrast, the inner BRB, \nsimilar to the blood-brain barrier (BBB) is located in the inner retinal microvasculature and \ncomprises the microvascular endothelium, which lines these vessels. The image given below shows the smoke-stack pattern seen in CSR. Amsler grid is used in detecting maculopathy. Uses: • Assess macular function • Evaluate the visual field of 10° • Good for follow-up in CSR The image below shows Amsler's grid. 237 \nSold by @itachibot",

An enlarging inkblot pattern or smoke stack pattern is seen in FFA. 238 \nSold by @itachibot Central serous retinopathy refers to the spontaneous serous detachment of the neurosensory \nretina in the macular region. Recent studies implicate an abnormal choroidal circulation as the \ncause of CSR. Clinical features: • Retinal detachment - Sudden painless loss of vision • Relative positive scotoma • Micropsia • Metamorphopsia Investigations: • Ophthalmoscopy - circular ring reflex present and foveal reflex absent • FFA - enlarging inkblot pattern or smoke stack pattern Spontaneous resolution is seen in most cases and hence observation is \nenough.

There are two types of ARMD: • Dry (non-exudative, non-neovascular) ARMD is the most common form, comprising around \n90% of the diagnosed cases. Initially characterized by macular Drusens, which later progress to \ngeographical atrophy. Geographic atrophy (GA) is the advanced stage of dry ARMD. Antioxidants \nlike the AREDS2 supplements have proven effective. • Wet (exudative, neovascular) ARMD is much less common than the dry type, but it is associated \nwith more rapid progression to advanced sight loss.

The characteristic flower-petal appearance is due to the \naccumulation of dye in the outer plexiform layer and inner nuclear layer at the macula The accumulation of fluid in the outer plexiform layer and the inner nuclear layer leads to retinal \nthickening at macula and loss of foveal depression, formation of cystic spaces (honey-comb \nmacula). Risk factors include retinitis pigmentosa, uveitis, niacin, PGE2 analogues, epinephrine in \naphakia, diabetic retinopathy, retinal venous occlusion and Irvin-Gass syndrome (CME \npost-cataract surgery). Symptoms may include blurring of vision, distortion, and micropsia. Therapeutic approaches for treating CME depend on the underlying etiology.

      "correct_answer": "a",
      "explanation": "Suprachoroidal hemorrhage will not cause hypotonic maculopathy in this patient. Maculopathy is common in eyes developing hypotony, which is defined as IOP &lt;6 mmHg. The \nmost common cause is excessive drainage following glaucoma filtration surgery (Option D). Other \ncauses include trauma such as cyclodialysis of the uvea (Option B), penetrating injury (Option C), \nchronic uveitis, retinal detachment, and other systemic causes such as dehydration, uncontrolled \ndiabetes, uremia, and treatment with hyperosmotic agents. They usually cause bilateral hypotonic \nmaculopathy. Suprachoroidal hemorrhage is a bleed into the suprachoroidal space that results from the rupture \nof the posterior ciliary artery. When the bleed is severe it causes extrusion of intraocular contents \nthat is termed as expulsive hemorrhage. It is a rare but dreaded complication of the \nphacoemulsification procedure. Signs seen in suprachoroidal hemorrhage are: • Progressive increase in intraocular pressure • Prolapse of iris 241 \nSold by @itachibot • Loss or partial obscuration of the red reflex • In severe cases there can be extrusion of the posterior segment contents into the anterior \nchamber and through the incision such as vitreous extrusion Immediate treatment involves rapid closure of the incision followed by administration of \nIOP-lowering medications such as oral acetazolamide and topical or systemic steroids to reduce \ninflammation. Standard post-operative antibiotics can be added in these patients.",

Hydroxychloroquine, which is generally used for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis, toxicity \ncauses bull’s eye maculopathy.

Stargardt's disease also known as Stargardt macular dystrophy or fundus flavimaculatus is the \nmost common macular dystrophy. It most commonly is inherited in an autosomal-recessive \nmanner caused by a mutation on an adenosine triphosphate-binding cassette (ABCA4) gene. Characterized by macular \"pisciform\" flecks that accumulate at the level of the retinal pigment \nepithelium (RPE), sometimes resulting in central macular atrophy early in life. Patients develop a \nmacula with a “beaten bronze” appearance caused by atrophic changes in the RPE. In addition, a \n\"dark\" or \"silent\" choroid is seen on the fluorescein angiography that appears as a prominent \nretinal circulation against hypofluorescent choroid. The electroretinogram (ERG) and electro-oculography (EOG) are normal early in the disease but \nmay be reduced in more advanced cases. Of note, the ERG findings do not directly correlate with \nclinical findings. There is no known proven treatment for this disease.

      "explanation": "Silent/Dark choroid on FFA is a feature of Stargardt's disease. The classic feature of 'silent choroid' \nis due to the masking of background choroidal fluorescence by lipofuscin deposits in the \nsubretinal space. Stargardt disease constitutes the most common type of macular dystrophy. It has mutations in a \nphotoreceptor cell-specific ATP-binding cassette gene (ABC4) that is usually inherited in an \nautosomal recessive manner. The disease usually starts in the juvenile group with progressive \ncentral vision loss and color vision loss that occurs due to the atrophy of the macular retinal \npigment epithelium with an accumulation of discrete pisciform flecks of lipofuscin. Signs of Stargardt’s disease: • Beaten bronze appearance of the macula that is caused by the atrophic changes in the RPE. • Silent/Dark choroid on FFA. • Visual field testing shows central vision loss. • The electroretinogram (ERG) is normal early in the disease but may be reduced in more \nadvanced cases. Fundus flavimaculatus is genetically considered to be a part of the same spectrum as Stargardt's \ndisease with late onset i.e. usually after 40 years of age. 250 \nSold by @itachibot Other options: Option B: Best's disease also known as vitelliform macular dystrophy is an autosomal dominant \nmacular dystrophy in which lipofuscin accumulates in the central macula, causing progressive \ncentral vision loss. This disease is linked to mutations in the bestrophin (VMD2) gene and they do \nnot exhibit silent choroid on FFA. Findings seen in Best’s disease are: • Vitelliform(yolk like) appearance of the fundus • Relatively normal ERG results associated with abnormal EOG The given below is the fundus picture of Best's disease showing an egg yolk lesion in the macula. Option C: Age related Macular degeneration(ARMD) also known as senile macular degeneration is \na chronic and progressive bilateral degenerative disorder of the macula that affects older \nindividuals &gt;50 yrs. ARMD is classified as dry and wet ARMD where the hallmarks are the \npresence of drusen and choroidal neovascularization respectively. Drusen are extracellular \neosinophilic deposits between RPE and Bruch’s membrane. 251 \nSold by @itachibot Clinical features include loss of central vision, distorted vision (lines seen as wavy), and sudden \npainless loss of vision as seen in wet ARMD. The image below shows Drusens in the macular area \nin dry macular degeneration. Option D: Cystoid Macular edema (CME) is a collection of fluid between the outer plexiform layer \nand the inner nuclear layer of the retina following a break in the blood-retinal barrier.
