      "explanation": "In squint surgery, muscle resection leads to the strengthening of the muscle. The main types of procedure in squint surgery are as follows: • Weakening to decrease the effective strength of action of a muscle. • Recession slackens a muscle by moving it away from its insertion. It can be performed on any \nmuscle except the superior oblique. • Disinsertion (or myectomy) involves detaching a muscle from its insertion without reattachment. \nIt is most commonly used to weaken an overacting inferior oblique muscle. • Posterior fixation suture: The principle of this (Faden) procedure is to suture the muscle belly to \nthe sclera posteriorly so as to decrease the pull of the muscle in its field of action without affecting \nthe eye in the primary position. • Strengthening, to enhance the pull of a muscle. • Resection shortens a muscle to enhance its effective pull. It is suitable only for the rectus muscle. • Tucking of a muscle or its tendon is usually confined to the enhancement of the action of the \nsuperior oblique muscle. • Advancement of the muscle nearer to the limbus can be used to enhance the action of a \npreviously recessed rectus muscle. • Vector adjustment procedures have the primary aim of altering the direction of muscle action. • Transposition refers to the relocation of one or more extraocular muscles to substitute for the \naction of an absent or severely deficient muscle. The most common indication is severe lateral \nrectus weakness due to acquired palsy of the 6th cranial nerve palsy.",

Paradoxical innervation of LR where it gets innervated by some fibres of III nerve instead of VI \nnerve. On impulse for abduction via VI nerve there is no abduction limitation. On impulse for \nadduction via III nerve both LR and MR contract thus causing retraction of globe (as the \nantagonist LR instead of relaxation, starts to contract) Duane’s retraction syndrome (DRS) is a cause of restrictive squint There is a failure of innervation of the lateral rectus by a hypoplastic sixth nerve nucleus, with \nanomalous innervation of the lateral rectus by fibers from the third nerve. Retraction of the globe \non attempted adduction. Widening of palpebral fissure on attempted abduction Classification by Huber: • Limitation of abduction- type 1 • Limitation of adduction- type 2 • Limitation of both- type 3 Note: DRS is an exception to Sherrington's law of reciprocal innervation.",

      "explanation": "487 \nSold by @itachibot Right superior rectus palsy is the cause for the given clinical scenario. The three-step test, also known as the Parks-Bielschowsky three-step test, is a diagnostic test used \nto identify which muscle is paralyzed in the case of an acquired hypertropia. This method uses the \ncover-uncover test, with or without the Maddox rod to measure the amount of deviation in \ndifferent head positions. The three-step test may also be used to diagnose the less common inferior oblique or vertical \nrectus muscle palsy. It is designed for the diagnosis of a single paretic vertical muscle and is \nunreliable when there are multiple paretic muscles or in restrictive strabismus. This test may also \nhelp in identifying if a superior rectus palsy is true or simulated in a patient with an inhibitional \npalsy of the contralateral antagonist. Using the three-step test in the above clinical scenario: Step 1. Which eye is hypotrophic? The eye hypotrophic in the primary position is the right eye. The paretic muscles can be right eye \nelevator or left eye depressor. • Right superior rectus • Right inferior oblique • Left inferior rectus • Left superior oblique Step 2.Does the hypotropia increase in the right gaze or left gaze? The hypotropia increases in right gaze. Therefore, the paretic muscle must be either (1) one of the muscles whose primary action is \nelevating the right eye on the right gaze, or (2) one of the muscles whose primary action is \ndepressing the left eye in the right gaze. The left inferior oblique and the right superior rectus \nboth have a primary action of elevation in right gaze. Therefore, one of these muscles could be the \nparetic muscle. Likewise, the left superior oblique and the right inferior rectus have a primary \naction of depression in the right gaze and could be paretic. But since the left inferior oblique and \nthe right inferior rectus did not meet step 1, they can be eliminated from the possible paretic \nmuscles. This leaves us: • Left superior oblique • Right superior rectus Step 3. Does the hypotropia increase in the right head tilt or left head tilt? The hypotropia increases in the right head tilt. If the deviation increases on right head tilt and \ndecreases on left head tilt, as it does in this example patient, then the right superior rectus is \nimplicated as the paretic culprit. 488 \nSold by @itachibot Disorders of Visual Pathway and Pupillary Reflexes",
