It is a rapidly growing \nacquired neoplasm composed of malignant stromal cells densely vascularized by blood vessels of \ncapillary size. The typical lesion appears as an expanding, bright red subepithelial mass that projects through \nand replaces the overlying conjunctival epithelium. Spontaneous bleeding leading to bloody tears \nor a subconjunctival hematoma is relatively common.

      "correct_answer": "c",
      "explanation": "The most likely diagnosis is rhabdomyosarcoma (RMS). Rhabdomyosarcoma is the most common \nsoft tissue sarcoma of childhood. 40% of rhabdomyosarcomas develop in the head and neck, and they are the most common \nprimary orbital malignancy in children but are still a rare condition. The older age of the child \npresenting with proptosis suggests rhabdomyosarcoma (average age 7 to 8 years) than \nretinoblastoma (average age at presentation is 18 months). The histopathology shows elongated to round spindle cells with features of skeletal muscle at \ndifferent stages of maturation with highly eosinophilic cytoplasm and hyperchromatic nuclei – the \nembryonal type of rhabdomyosarcoma Immunohistochemistry is useful in identifying skeletal muscle proteins, such as alpha-actin, \nmyosin, desmin, and myoglobin Rhabdomyosarcoma shows a strong tendency for local invasion, local recurrence, and \nhematogenous and lymphatic metastases. Decision-making for management is based on histopathologic confirmation as well as the staging \nof orbital RMS, which includes imaging (MRI of primary tumor, chest-CT, Tc bone scan), \npathology, and work-up for metastases(bone marrow biopsy). Treatment options include chemotherapy (vincristine, cyclophosphamide, and actinomycin D) and \nradiotherapy.",

Choroidal melanoma is a primary intraocular malignancy in adults that peaks around 60 years of \nage. Symptoms include a range of visual disturbances such as painless decrease in vision and \nmetamorphosia when macula is involved. Other features of Choroidal melanoma includes: • A solitary elevated subretinal grey-brown dome shaped mass • Clumps of orange pigment are common over the mass • Collar stud appearance on B-scan (option C): It is pathagnomic of choridal melanoma. It is seen \nif the tumour breaks through the Bruch's membrane into the subretinal space . • Associated haemorrhage Smoke stack pattern (option A) and ink blot (option B) pattern is seen on FFA in central serous \nretinopathy (CSR). CSR is the spontaneous serous detachment of the sensory neuroretina in the foveal region with or \nwithout retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) detachment. This occurs due Choroidal vascular hyperpermeability. On FFA it is initially seen as an ink-blot pattern or smoke stack pattern \nof hyperfluorescence which then spreads to take the configuration \nof mushroom or umbrella pattern.

Signs: • An intraretinal tumor is a homogeneous, dome-shaped white lesion that becomes irregular, often \nwith white flecks of calcification. • An endophytic tumor projects into the vitreous as a white mass that may \"seed\" into the gel. • An exophytic tumor forms multilobular subretinal white masses and causes an overlying retinal \ndetachment.

      "explanation": "Knudson's two-hit hypothesis describes the occurrence of retinoblastoma. Knudson's hypothesis can be stated as follows: • Two mutations (hits), involving both alleles of RB are required to produce retinoblastoma. • In familial retinoblastoma, one of the pair of alleles of RB1 is mutated in all the cells of the body. \nWhen a further mutagenic event (\"second hit\" according to the \"two-hit\" hypothesis proposed by \nKnudson) affects the second allele, the cell may then undergo malignant transformation. A large \nmajority of these children develop bilateral and multifocal tumors. • In sporadic cases, both RB alleles must undergo somatic mutation in the same retinoblast (two \nhits). Familial retinoblastoma patients also have a predisposition to non-ocular cancers because of the \npresence of the mutation in all cells, such as pinealoblastoma (usually before the age of 5 years), \nosteosarcomas, soft tissue sarcomas, and melanomas.
