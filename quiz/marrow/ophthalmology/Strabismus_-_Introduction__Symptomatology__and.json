Actions of the superior oblique: • Intorsion • Depression • Abduction Longest extraocular muscle: Superior oblique Shortest extraocular muscle: Inferior oblique The primary action of a muscle is its major effect when the eye is in the primary position. Subsidiary actions are the additional effects; these depend on the position of the eye. The spiral of Tillaux is an imaginary line joining the insertions of the four recti and is an \nimportant anatomical landmark when performing surgery. 451 \nSold by @itachibot",

      "explanation": "The muscle marked is the medial rectus. The medial rectus is supplied by the oculomotor nerve, \nthe nucleus of which is situated at the level of the superior colliculus in the posterior midbrain. The oculomotor (3rd cranial) nerve nucleus consists of • Single central nuclei for the levator palpebrae muscle of both the eyes • Bilateral subnuclei with crossed projections supplying the contralateral superior rectus • Bilateral subnuclei with uncrossed projections supplying the ipsilateral inferior rectus, inferior \noblique, medial rectus in the dorso-ventral order. • Bilateral subnuclei known as the Edinger-Westphal nucleus which provides parasympathetic \ninput to the ciliary body and the iris sphincter. Option A: Superior olivary nucleus is an important relay station in the auditory pathway, it is \nresponsible for detection of direction and localization of sound. Option B: Inferior colliculus- The trochlear(4th cranial) nerve nucleus lies in the midbrain at the \nlevel of the inferior colliculus. The trochlear nerves leave the midbrain from its posterior surface \nand decussate before supplying the contralateral superior oblique muscle of the eyeball. Option D: Facial colliculus- the facial colliculus is located in the cranial part of the pons. It is \nproduced by the facial nerve(7th cranial nerve) winding around the nucleus of the abducens nerve \n(6th cranial nerve).",

The slow phase \noccurs in the direction of the moving stimulus; the fast phase occurs as a saccadic refixation \nmovement in the opposite direction. In patients with congenital motor nystagmus, a reversal of \nthe OKN response may occur.

      "explanation": "The given test is a Maddox rod test, and the pattern of the appearance of white dot/light in \nrelation to the red line denotes a case of left eye exophoria. In the given image, the above image \nrefers to the examiner's view and the below image refers to the patient's view. The Maddox rod can be used to test for horizontal and vertical deviations, and when used in \nconjunction with another Maddox rod, for cyclo-deviations. Interpretation: To test for horizontal deviations, the Maddox rod is placed in front of one eye (for this example, \nthe left eye) with the cylinders in the horizontal direction. The patient fixates a point source of \nlight and then sees a vertical red line with the left eye and white dot/light with the right eye: • Orthophoria: if the light/dot superimposes the line. • Exo-deviation/exophoria: In this example, light/dot is on the left side of the line (rod placed on \nleft eye) • Eso-deviation/esophoria: if the light was on the right side of the line (rod placed on left eye) Maddox Rod Test involves the use of a Maddox rod and the Maddox tangent scale. It uses a \nspecially constructed device, consisting of a series of parallel cylinders, that converts a point \nsource of light into a line image. The optical properties of the cylinders cause the streak of light to \nbe situated 90° to the orientation of the parallel cylinders. 461 \nSold by @itachibot In the image given below, the interpretation of the result is based on how the patient visualizes it. \nIt would appear to be crossed to the patient. Pictorial representation of the eyes are as seen by the \nexaminer. Imagine you are looking through a Maddox rod over your left eye while interpreting the \nimages. 462 \nSold by @itachibot 463 \nSold by @itachibot Strabismus - Types and Treatment",
