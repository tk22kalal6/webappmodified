Perkin's line is \nperpendicular to Hilgenreiner's line. The image below shows the vertical Perkin's line and the horizontal Hilgenreiner’s line. Normally \nthe femoral head lies in the inner and lower quadrant formed by these lines. But in DDH the \nfemoral head is in the upper and outer quadrant. Option C: Shenton's line is a smooth curve formed by the inferior border of the neck of the femur \nwith superior margin of the obturator foramen. It is broken in DDH and fractured neck of the \nfemur. 345 \nSold by @itachibot Option D: Klein's line is a line along the superior aspect of the femoral neck which normally \nintersects the epiphysis. In slipped capital femoral epiphysis, Klein's line does not intersect the \nepiphysis and passes superior to it.",
