        "d": "It is rarely idiopathic"
      },
      "correct_answer": "b",
      "explanation": "241 \nSold by @itachibot The given clinical scenario and X-ray are suggestive of scoliosis. In this condition, the lateral \ncurvature of the spine is &gt; 10 degrees in the coronal plane, in the upright position. Scoliosis deranges the load and force transmission mechanism through the spine. It is most \ncommonly an idiopathic condition. It jeopardizes the functioning of vital organs like the lungs and \nheart through overcrowding of ribs. Medical intervention is indicated if the lateral curvature is &gt;25 degrees. Various modalities \ninclude brace application and surgical correction. Note: If the lateral curve of the spine is &lt; 10 degrees then it is known as spinal asymmetry.",

      "explanation": "Idiopathic scoliosis is the most common type of scoliosis. Scoliosis may be classified as: • Idiopathic scoliosis - No obvious cause is detected. Several genetic associations have been noted • Congenital scoliosis - Caused due to failure in vertebra formation or segmentation during \ndevelopment • Neuromuscular scoliosis - Caused due to neuromuscular disorders like cerebral palsy, muscular \ndystrophy, etc. • Scoliosis due to generalized diseases - Seen in conditions such as: • Neurofibromatosis • Marfan syndrome • Bone dysplasia • Tumors • Due to irradiation",

Scoliosis is classified into 2 types: • Structural scoliosis - There is a non-correctable deformity due to vertebral rotation in the \naffected spinal segments • Postural scoliosis (non-structural) - • The deformity is secondary to a condition outside the spine • Seen in conditions such as: • Short leg: curvature disappears when the patient is made to sit) • Hip contracture with pelvic tilt: disappears after the disc prolapse is managed) 242 \nSold by @itachibot • Lumbar disc prolapse (sciatic scoliosis) • If scoliosis is due to poor posture, the deformity disappears when the person is asked to bend \nforward",

Steps of Adam's test : • Patient is asked to bend forward at the waist until the spine is at the horizontal level • Knees must be maintained straight, with the feet together, the arms dependent, and the palms in \nopposition • Examiner observes the trunk from behind (to assess midthoracic and lumbar rotation) and from \nthe front (to assess upper thoracic rotation) It is used to differentiate between structural and non-structural curves in scoliosis. On bending \nforward, non-structural scoliosis disappears, while structural scoliosis persists.",

Congenital scoliosis is a lateral curvature of the spine which is always associated with a \nradiologically demonstrable anomaly of the vertebral bodies, which includes: • Hemivertebrae (where only one-half of the vertebra grows) • Block vertebrae (where two vertebral bodies fuse) • An unsegmented bar (a bone bar joining two adjacent vertebrae on one side, which hinders \ngrowth on that side) The image below shows a unilateral and unsegmented bar with contralateral hemivertebra: In infantile scoliosis (option C), most curves are thoracic with convexity to the left and the \nanomalies described above are absent. 244 \nSold by @itachibot Note: The most progressive type of congenital scoliosis is a concave, unilateral unsegmented bar \nwith a convex hemivertebra.",

      "correct_answer": "c",
      "explanation": "In the given X-ray of a patient with scoliosis, the degree of lateral curvature is measured \nusing Cobb's method. The degree of curvature of scoliosis on plain radiographs is measured \nusing Cobb's angle. To measure the Cobbs's angle, first locate the superior-end vertebra and inferior-end vertebra of \nthe curve. Then draw perpendicular lines to the superior surface of the superior-end vertebra and \nto the inferior surface of the inferior-end vertebra. The angle formed at the intersection of these perpendiculars is the angle of the spinal curve \nknown as Cobb's angle. It can also be measured by measuring the angle made by the intersection \nof the end-plate lines. Note: Nash and Moe's method, Perdriolle and Vidal method, and Stokes method are methods of \nassessing vertebral rotation.",

      "correct_answer": "a",
      "explanation": "Risser's sign evaluates skeletal maturation using the ossification of the iliac apophysis. Risser's sign is used to predict the worsening of scoliosis and in the planning of corrective surgery. The iliac apophysis is divided into four quadrants. The ossification of iliac apophyses normally \nproceeds from lateral to the medial side i.e., from the anterior superior iliac spine to the posterior \nsuperior iliac spine. 245 \nSold by @itachibot The Risser sign progresses from grade 0 (no ossification) to grade 4 (all four quadrants have \nossified). When the apophysis has fused completely with the ilium, it is Risser grade 5 and the \npatient is considered skeletally mature. Risser's grade 5 (fusion with the ilium) coincides with the fusion of the apophysis in the vertebral \nring. After this, there is no possibility of further progression of the scoliosis curve.",

It has a hard polypropylene \nouter shell with a soft foam lining inside. It is used in patients whose scoliosis curve apex is at T7 \nor lower. Braces are used to prevent progression and avoid surgery in scoliotic curves between 20 and 30 \ndegrees. A variety of braces are available, some are created as cast and some are prefabricated. They usually extend from the thoracic and lumbar spine to the pelvis and have pads to push the \nspine into correct alignment. Braces used in scoliosis: • Milwaukee brace : • Originally designed cervico-thoracic-lumbar-sacral orthosis (CTLSO) introduced in the 1940s • Less commonly used nowadays due to the convenience of modern braces • Still used for scoliosis with curves in the high thoracic and cervical spine • Boston brace • Risser's cast : • Body cast that extends up to the cervical spine and touches the chin and skull • A hole is cut in the abdominal region to make breathing easy • Charleston bending brace &amp; Providence brace: • Used while laying down and sleeping at night for 8 to 10 hours • Best suited for single thoracolumbar or lumbar curves 247 \nSold by @itachibot",
