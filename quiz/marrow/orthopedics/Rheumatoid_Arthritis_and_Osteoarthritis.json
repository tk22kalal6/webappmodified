      "correct_answer": "c",
      "explanation": "Methotrexate with anti-TNF is superior to any other treatment in limiting progression of joint \ndestruction and disability. 407 \nSold by @itachibot In rheumatoid arthritis (RA) joint inflammation is the main cause of joint damage and is the most \nimportant factor of joint disability and deformities. Methotrexate belongs to the category of drugs known as disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs \n(DMARDs). They slow down or prevent the structural progression of RA and hence are used in \nmost combination therapies. Among the DMARDs, methotrexate is the preferred first-line drug. Biologic DMARDs such as anti-TNF agents target cytokines and cell-surface molecules to slow the \nprogression of joint inflammation. These drugs are typically used in combination with background \nmethotrexate therapy. Combination therapy with methotrexate and an anti-TNF drug is the most commonly used next \nstep for the treatment of patients with deformities, having an inadequate response to \nmethotrexate therapy. Steroids are used when rapid control of the disease is required. They have a rapid onset of action, \nwhile the DMARDs take anywhere from 6-12 weeks to come into effect. They can be used as a \ncover during this period. Steroids can also be used in short courses for acute flare-up episodes of \nRA. Long-term use of steroids is not advised due to their adverse effects such as osteoporosis. \nThey are usually not used alone (option A) but are used as an adjunct to DMARDs like \nmethotrexate (option B). Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are used as adjunctive therapy for the \nmanagement of uncontrollable symptoms because of their analgesic and anti-inflammatory \nproperties. Chronic use is not advised due to their side effects namely gastritis and peptic ulcer \ndisease as well as impairment of renal function (option D) Hence, among the given options methotrexate with anti-TNF is the best therapy in a patient with \ndeformity.",
