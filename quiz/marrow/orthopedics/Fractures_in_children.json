      "explanation": "Most supracondylar fractures (98%) are extension-type injuries. They are usually caused by a fall \nonto an outstretched hand. Supracondylar humeral fractures are the most common type of pediatric elbow fracture. They \nmost commonly lead to the following nerve injuries: • Extension-type: Anterior interosseous nerve • Flexion-type: Ulnar nerve According to the Gartland classification, there are 3 types of fractures: • Type I: Undisplaced • Type II: Some degree of displacement • Type III: Complete displacement The following x-ray shows a type III supracondylar fracture of the humerus: 318 \nSold by @itachibot",

      },
      "correct_answer": "b",
      "explanation": "This clinical scenario with a pink and pulseless arm is suggestive of a supracondylar fracture with \nadequate perfusion. The treatment of choice is reduction and pinning, followed by observation. On the other hand, if there is poor perfusion due to vascular compromise, the affected arm is pale \nand cool to the touch. In this case, the urgent reduction must be performed in the operating room. \nAfter reduction, the vascular status of the hand is reassessed. If the hand remains pale, \nexploration of the brachial artery, the release of entrapped structures, and direct repair with vein \ngrafting may be required.",

      "explanation": "The physeal injury depicted in the given diagram is classified as Salter-Harris type II. In a type II fracture, the fracture line passes through the metaphysis into the epiphyseal \nplate. This results in a metaphyseal fragment called the Thurston-Holland fragment. The \nepiphysis is spared.",

      "correct_answer": "b",
      "explanation": "The pointing index sign is seen in supracondylar fractures of the humerus. This finding occurs as a result of injury to the median nerve. It results in loss of function of both \nflexor digitorum profundus (FDP) and flexor digitorum superficialis (FDS). Hence, the index \nfinger sticks out when the patient is asked to clasp their hand.

      "explanation": "This clinical scenario is suggestive of battered baby syndrome. 320 \nSold by @itachibot Non-accidental trauma must be suspected when there are ecchymoses and fractures in various \nstages of healing. This indicates that the trauma has occurred over a period of time. Metaphyseal \ncorner or bucket handle fractures are typically seen on x-ray. Sub-epiphyseal micro-fracture is also \na feature of child abuse that is seen on MRI. In such cases, a radiological assessment of the entire skeleton is indicated. The minimum x-ray \nviews required in a case of suspected child abuse are: • AP views of the entire skeleton • Dedicated views of hands and feet • Lateral views of the axial and appendicular skeleton",

      "explanation": "The distal radius is involved in Madelung deformity. This is a congenital or post-traumatic deformity in children due to disruption of the ulnar and \nvolar aspect of the growth plate of the distal radius. This disruption is believed to be caused by the \nVicker's ligament. This ligament normally tethers the lunate to the distal radius proximal to the \nphysis. 322 \nSold by @itachibot Disruption of the growth plate causes a ventral curvature of the distal radius. However, the ulna \ncontinues to grow and the distal ulna appears more prominent may stick out as a lump on the \nback of the wrist. This is known as a positive ulnar variance. There is volar subluxation of the \nhand.",
