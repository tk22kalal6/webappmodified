      "explanation": "Osteomalacia, secondary hyperparathyroidism, and rickets occur due to nutritional deficiency. Metabolic bone disorders due to nutritional deficiencies include: • Vitamin D deficiency may lead to: • Rickets- in children • Osteomalacia- in adults • secondary hyperparathyroidism • Vitamin C deficiency may lead to scurvy Primary hyperparathyroidism occurs due to an adenoma or hyperplasia of the parathyroid gland. \nThis leads to the unregulated production of parathyroid hormone. Osteopetrosis occurs due to decreased osteoclastic activity.",

      "explanation": "Raised parathormone level and raised alkaline phosphatase along with low serum calcium and low \nserum phosphate level is suggestive of rickets. Nutritional rickets occurs due to deficiency of vitamin D. This leads to low calcium levels in the \nblood. To raise the serum calcium, the secretion of the parathyroid hormone rises. The \nparathyroid hormone tries to raise the calcium levels by : 358 \nSold by @itachibot • Reabsorbing calcium in the kidneys and secreting phosphate in exchange leading to low \nphosphate levels • Increasing bone resorption",

Rickets is a bone mineralization disorder that primarily affects children with open growth plates, \nresulting from a deficiency of vitamin D, calcium, or phosphate. In toddlers, genu varum is one of the most common initial sign of rickets. In older children, genu \nvalgum or coxa vara might be present.",

      "explanation": "Widening of the metaphyseal ends is known as splaying. It occurs because of the accumulation of \nnon-mineralized osteoid at the metaphyseal ends. Defective mineralization of osteoid also results in fraying and cupping. Fraying is the worn-out \nappearance of the metaphyseal margins. Cupping is the concave appearance of the metaphysis. \nBowing is seen in the diaphysis of the long bones affected by rickets. The given radiograph shows splaying, fraying and cupping. 359 \nSold by @itachibot",

      },
      "correct_answer": "d",
      "explanation": "The given clinical scenario and the image showing scorbutic rosary are suggestive of scurvy. Scurvy results from the deficiency of vitamin C. Vitamin C is required for the hydroxylation of \nlysine and proline that are used in the synthesis of collagen. Hence, deficiency of vitamin C leads \nto the formation of defective collagen. Defective collagen results in capillary hemorrhages which may present as generalized bleeding \ntendency. It also results in defective osteoid formation. Subperiosteal hemorrhages cause acute \npain and swelling mimicking acute osteomyelitis. Costo-chondral separation leads to the formation of tender nodules, also known as scorbutic \nrosary. Rickets also presents with similar nodules at the costochondral junctions known as \nrachitic rosary. They can be differentiated as scorbutic rosary is more sharply angulated and are \npainful.",

      },
      "correct_answer": "a",
      "explanation": "The given clinical scenario is suggestive of the infantile form of osteopetrosis. It is characterised \nby decreased osteoclastic activity due to defect in carbonic anhydrase ll proton pump. The excessive new bone formation with defective resorption leads to abnormal development of the \nskull, especially causing narrowing of the foramina of the skull. This leads to various \ncomplications like hydrocephalus, cranial nerve compression leading to deafness and facial palsy, \nsinus blockage, etc. Failure of bone resorption results in poorly formed medullary cavity. This leads to defective \nhematopoiesis in the medullary cavity and stimulation of extramedullary hematopoiesis. Hence, \nthe infant presents with pancytopenia and hepatosplenomegaly. Abnormal bone density may also lead to altered vasculature causing complications like osteitis of \nthe mandible. Excess bone density also leads to endobone appearance and rugger jersey appearance of vertebrae \non radiograph. X-ray spine of a patient with osteopetrosis is given below. Renal osteodystrophy also shows rugger jersey appearance of vertebrae on x-ray. However, renal \nosteodystrophy is a complication of chronic kidney disease and the patient is an infant. So the \nlikely answer in the patient in the given scenario is osteopetrosis (Option B). 362 \nSold by @itachibot 363 \nSold by @itachibot Osteoporosis and Osteomalacia",
