      "explanation": "Paget’s disease is characterized by increased bone turnover with enlargement and thickening of \nthe bone. It is also called osteitis deformans. It manifests in 4th and 5th-decade males. The pathologic process in Paget's disease is initiated by overactive osteoclastic bone \nresorption followed by a compensatory increase in osteoblastic new bone formation. This results \nin a structurally disorganized mosaic of woven and lamellar bone causing the bones to \nbe unusually brittle. Plasma alkaline phosphatase is increased due to the osteoblastic activity.",

An initial osteolytic phase involves prominent bone resorption and marked hypervascularization. \nRadiographically, this manifests as an advancing lytic wedge or blade of grass or flame shaped 387 \nSold by @itachibot lesion. The second phase is a period of very active bone formation and resorption. It is characterised by \nnormal lamellar bone replaced with haphazard (woven) bone. In the final sclerotic phase, bone resorption declines progressively and leads to a hard, dense, less \nvascular mosaic bone, which represents the so-called burned-out phase of Paget’s disease.

This leads to increased warmth over the limbs. They \nmay also have kyphosis and bowing of legs. Increased bone formation in Paget's disease may lead \nto the narrowing of the foramina of the skull. This causes compression of the cranial nerves which \nmay lead to deafness. Deafness due to the narrowing of cranial nerve foramina is also seen in osteopetrosis. However, it \ncan be differentiated from Paget's disease by the absence of lytic lesions of the bone.",

The given clinical scenario is suggestive of renal osteodystrophy which is caused \nby hyperparathyroidism secondary to chronic renal disease. Rugger jersey appearance is seen due to osteosclerosis of the superior and inferior vertebral \nendplates.
