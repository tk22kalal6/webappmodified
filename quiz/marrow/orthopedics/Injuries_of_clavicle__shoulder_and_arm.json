      "correct_answer": "b",
      "explanation": "The middle third of the clavicle is most commonly fractured. The middle third of the clavicle is narrowest and has the least amount of surrounding soft tissue \nstructures. Therefore, 80% of fractures are seen in this area. 70 \nSold by @itachibot Within the middle-third of the clavicle, the junction of the medial 3/5th and the lateral 2/5th has \nbeen described to be the weakest point. Lateral third fractures are the second most common type \nof clavicular fractures. Fall on the shoulder (direct impact) and fall on the outstretched hand are the most common \ncauses of clavicle fracture.",

      "correct_answer": "c",
      "explanation": "The lateral fragment in a clavicle fracture is displaced inferiorly due to the force of gravity acting \non the ipsilateral arm. The medial fragment is held up by the action of the sternocleidomastoid muscle. (Note: Both Pectoralis muscle and the weight of arm are responsible, but since the weight of arm \nis superior to the muscle bulk and even as per standard reference we would go with the rational \nexplanation.) 71 \nSold by @itachibot",

Malunion is the most \ncommon complication in clavicle fractures The most common bone to be fractured is the clavicle. It is also the most common bone to be \nfractured during birth. Neurological deficit is rare in clavicular shaft fractures. Undisplaced fractures are treated with a sling or figure of eight bandages for 2-3 weeks. This is \nfollowed by mobilization of the limb as the pain subsides. Displaced fractures are treated with internal fixation either by contoured locking plates or \nintramedullary nails. 72 \nSold by @itachibot",

      "correct_answer": "c",
      "explanation": "Velpeau bandage is not used in glenoid fossa fractures as they require surgical fixation because \nthey are intra-articular. Velpeau bandaging is done by keeping the patient's elbow flexed and the forearm placed against \nthe chest. A sling is then applied to support the weight of the arm. Several layers of restrictive \nbandages are then applied around the arm and the torso. Velpeau bandage is commonly used for: • Acromioclavicular dislocations • Humeral shaft fractures • After open reduction of posterior shoulder dislocation Acromioclavicular joint injuries are usually seen with direct injury to the lateral shoulder. They \nare also seen after fall on an outstretched arm with the elbow locked in extension. They are classified into six types using the Rockwood classification. Type 1-3 is managed \nconservatively using the Velpeau bandage. Type 4-6 is treated by open reduction and internal \nfixation. 73 \nSold by @itachibot",

      "explanation": "The inferior glenohumeral ligament is the most important in maintaining shoulder joint stability. \nIt is the main stabilizer when the shoulder is abducted and in extreme ranges of motion. The shoulder joint is anatomically unstable. Only 25% of the humeral head articulates with the \nglenoid. The joint is reinforced by: • Static stabilizers (3 capsular thickenings or ligaments): • Superior glenohumeral ligament (SGHL) • Middle glenohumeral ligament (MGHL) • Inferior glenohumeral ligament (IGHL) • Dynamic stabilizers (rotator cuff muscles): • Supraspinatus • Infraspinatus • Teres minor • Subscapularis • The long head of biceps 74 \nSold by @itachibot",

      "explanation": "This radiograph shows anterior dislocation of the shoulder. The nerve commonly injured in \nanterior dislocation is the axillary nerve, not the radial nerve. The radiograph shows the disturbed articulation between the humeral head and glenoid fossa. The \nhumeral head is seen below and medial to the glenoid socket. This suggests anterior dislocation of \nthe shoulder joint. Common cause for anterior dislocation: • Young adults - athletic injuries • Elderly - falls Bankart lesion is a tear in the anteroinferior part of the glenoid labrum caused by the head of the \nhumerus during anterior dislocation. Hill-Sachs lesion is a compression fracture on the posterolateral aspect of the humeral head. It \nis caused by the pressure of the anterior glenoid rim on the humeral head in recurrent \ndislocations. 75 \nSold by @itachibot",

During an anterior shoulder dislocation, the head of the humerus can tear the anteroinferior part \nof the glenoid labrum. This is known as Bankart lesion. In some cases, a small fragment of bone \nfrom the glenoid rim can also get avulsed. This is known as a bony Bankart lesion.
