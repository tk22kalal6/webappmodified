      "explanation": "The earliest symptom of acute compartment syndrome is pain. Acute compartment syndrome is a surgical emergency caused by increased pressure within a \nfascial compartment, leading to tissue ischemia. It is characterized by rapid progression of pain \nand swelling in an extremity, commonly precipitated by traumatic injury. The classic features of ischemia in acute compartment syndrome include the 5 P's: • Pain - It is the first symptom of acute compartment syndrome. Ischemic muscle is highly \nsensitive to touch. On passive stretching of the muscles, severe pain can be elicited. • Paresthesia - It is the first sign of nerve ischemia. • Pallor - It may not be seen always. The skin outside the compartment may be normally perfused, \nas only the intra-compartmental perfusion may be affected. • Paralysis - Paralysis of muscle groups affected in that compartment is a late sign. • Pulselessness - Usually, the peripheral pulses and capillary return are intact in the early stages, \nunless there is a major arterial injury. If pulses are absent, arteriography is indicated. The diagnosis can be confirmed by measuring the intra-compartmental pressure using a split \ncatheter introduced into the compartment. The difference between diastolic pressure and \ncompartment pressure is known as differential pressure (P). A differential pressure (P) of less \nthan 30 mm Hg (4.00 kilopascals) is an indication for immediate compartment decompression by \nperforming a fasciotomy.",

      "explanation": "36 \nSold by @itachibot The given clinical scenario is suggestive of crush syndrome. In this condition hyperkalemia is \nseen, not hypokalemia. Crush syndrome can result when a limb is compressed for a prolonged period. For e.g. getting \ncrushed or entrapped in a vehicle or rubble and after extended use of a pneumatic antishock \ngarment. This results in hypoperfusion and myonecrosis in the crushed limb. When the limb is \nreleased from the compression, toxic metabolites get released to cause reperfusion injury. Crush syndrome can result in a systemic reaction due to tissue necrosis. Free myoglobin can lead \nto acute tubular necrosis and renal failure. Myonecrosis can lead to metabolic acidosis with \nhyperkalaemia and hypocalcaemia. The procoagulants escaped into the systemic circulation can \nproduce systemic coagulopathy. Management of crush syndrome: • Encouraging high urine flow, along with alkalization of urine with sodium bicarbonate to \nprevent precipitation of myoglobin in the renal tubules • Renal hemofiltration if there is oliguria or renal failure • If compartment syndrome is confirmed, then fasciotomy is performed • Radical excision of necrosed muscle to avoid sepsis • Aggressive management of the open wound",

Reperfusion injury is the term used for a group of complications that follow the re-establishment \nof blood flow to ischemic tissues. It can also occur after fasciotomy and following restoration of \nblood flow to muscles in acute compartment syndrome. Reperfusion results in an inflammatory response in the ischemic tissue, which is probably \ntriggered by muscle breakdown products. These activate the intrinsic clotting system resulting \nin microvascular thrombosis. When a large amount of muscle is ischemic, there can be a \nsystemic inflammatory response and systemic coagulopathy. The mediators released into systemic \ncirculation damage the vascular endothelium, leading to increased permeability, transcapillary \nfluid leakage, worsening of intra-compartmental pressure, and eventually multiple organ failure.",

Fat embolism is the presence of fat globules in vital organs and peripheral circulation after a \nfracture of the long bone or other major trauma.

Risk factors for non-union include the following: • Host related factors - • Advanced age • Malnutrition • Smoking • Endocrine diseases (diabetes) • Immunosuppression • Osteoporosis • Vascular diseases • Taking medications that delay bone healing • Fracture related factors - • High energy fractures • Greater degree of soft tissue injury • Bone loss • Periosteal stripping 40 \nSold by @itachibot • Devascularization • Infection/contamination • Treatment related factors - • Lack of good stabilization • Following improper technique such as poor casting • Rigid fixation with bone gaps • NSAIDs (implicated in some studies)",

      "correct_answer": "a",
      "explanation": "Among the given fractures, proximal scaphoid fractures are most prone to non-union. Since the nutrient artery enters the scaphoid near its distal end, proximal fractures are associated \nwith avascular necrosis and non-union. The more proximal the fracture in the scaphoid, the \nhigher the chances of avascular necrosis and non-union. Certain bones have a relatively limited or watershed blood supply that can potentially get \ninterrupted by fracture. These include: • Head of the femur: after fracture of the neck or posterior dislocation of the hip. • Proximal scaphoid: due to fracture through the waist of the scaphoid. • Lunate: following a dislocation. • Body of talus: after fracture of its neck. Fractures in these sites have a higher risk for non-union or development of osteonecrosis. Other options: Option B: Inter-trochanteric fractures involve either the greater or lesser trochanters or both, \nmore common in the elderly following a history of a fall. Malunion is the most frequent \ncomplication. The vast metaphyseal region has an abundant blood supply, contributing to a higher \nunion rate and fewer chances of avascular necrosis. Option C: Distal radius fractures occur by fall on an outstretched hand and they include Colles' \nfracture (most common), Smith's fracture, Barton's fracture, and Chauffer's fracture. The \ncomplications include joint stiffness, malunion (more common), carpal tunnel syndrome, \nsubluxation of the inferior radio-ulnar joint, Sudeck's dystrophy, and rupture of the extensor \npollicis longus tendon. Avascular necrosis or non-union is rare. Option D: Olecranon fracture results from a direct injury as in a fall onto the point of the elbow. \nComplications include non-union, elbow stiffness, and osteoarthritis. 41 \nSold by @itachibot",

Although the enlarged fracture ends suggest active osteogenesis, the gap is not bridged because of \ninadequate stability. Such non-unions have adequate vascularity and display abundant callus. Based on the biologic potential for fracture healing, non-union can be of the following types: • Atrophic: Poor healing response with no callus formation due to little or no active bone-forming \ncells at the fracture site. The blood supply is typically poor. On radiography, there is an absence of \nbone reaction. • Oligotrophic: There is minimal callus formation, often due to inadequate approximation of \nfracture surfaces. On radiography, there is minimal bone healing reaction. • Hypertrophic: These fractures have an adequate healing response and good vascularity. There is \na lack of adequate stability for the union to occur. On radiography, there is usually abundant \ncallus formation with an intervening dark area of fibrocartilage-lacking mineral. It can occur after \ninitial nonoperative management or in some cases after initial operative management where there \nwas inadequate stabilization. Pseudoarthrosis has features of hypertrophic nonunion, but due to excessive and chronic motility, \nthere is the formation of a pseudo-capsule containing fluid similar to an actual synovial joint. 42 \nSold by @itachibot",

BMP is a bone-stimulating protein used as a bone graft in the treatment of non-union and open \ntibial fractures. Bone grafts can be: • Osteoinductive: They stimulate osteogenesis through the differentiation of mesenchymal cells \ninto osteoprogenitor cells. BMPs are osteoinductive. • Osteoconductive: They provide linkage across defects and a scaffold upon which new bone can \nform. Calcium phosphate (Option C), calcium hydroxyapatite, and calcium sulfate (Option D) are \nosteoconductive. Polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA), also known as bone cement, holds bone and metal implants \ntogether by forming an interlocking network between the irregularities. 46 \nSold by @itachibot Regional conditions of neck",
