It \nmanifests as flaccidity, loss of sensation, and absence of reflexes below the level of the injury. The primitive reflexes are absent in spinal shock. These include: • Bulbocavernosus reflex (root value S2- S4): Tested by squeezing the penis in males or applying \npressure on the clitoris in females. The normal response is the contraction of the anal sphincter. If \nthe patient has in situ Foley's catheter, it can be gently pulled to test anal contraction in both \ngenders. • Anal wink reflex (root value S2- S4): Tested by stroking the skin around the anus. The normal \nresponse is the contraction of the anal sphincter. Spinal shock usually lasts less than 48 hours and the reflexes return to normal. Resolution of \nspinal shock is indicated by the return of the bulbocavernosus and the anal wink reflex. The path of the bulbocavernosus reflex is depicted below. 222 \nSold by @itachibot",

Jefferson's fracture is a burst fracture of the ring of the atlas (C1). It occurs due to axial forces and \ncan be stable or unstable as shown below. Jefferson's fracture is identified in an open-mouth X-ray view (odontoid view). The displacement \nof the lateral process of C1 over C2 is checked in this X-ray to evaluate if the transverse ligament is \ntorn. If the total displacement (sum of displacement on both sides) of C1 lateral masses relative to C2 is \nmore than 6.9 mm, the transverse ligament is likely to be damaged. This is known as the rule of \nSpence which is used to determine if the fracture is stable or unstable. If the transverse ligament \nis torn, it is classified as an unstable fracture.

      "explanation": "The given patient has a burst fracture of L4 vertebra. The given lateral view CT image shows that the L4 vertebra has exploded. The posterior border of \nL4 has lost its concavity and has become convex. There is posterior displacement of the bone into \nthe spinal canal. This is diagnostic of burst fracture of the L4 vertebra with retropulsion. 232 \nSold by @itachibot Burst fracture results from severe axial compression that explodes the vertebral body. Radiological findings: • AP view X-rays: Spreading of the vertebral body with an increase of the interpedicular distance \nmay be seen. • Lateral view X-rays: Posterior displacement of bone into the spinal canal (retropulsion) can be \nseen at the posterosuperior border of the vertebral body. The normal concavity of the posterior \nvertebral body becomes convex in retropulsion. Management of burst fractures: • Stable burst fracture: • Minimal anterior wedging and posterior ligament complex intact • No neurological deficits • Conservatively managed with bed rest until acute symptoms settle, followed by a thoracolumbar \nbrace (TLSO) or body cast for about 12 weeks • Unstable burst fracture: • Cases of neurological injury • Disruption of the posterior ligamentous complex (PLC) • More than 50% canal compromise on CT • Operative management done • Posterior pedicle screw fixation is the standard treatment for PLC disruption",

        "a": "It is an inherently stable horizontal fracture",

      },
      "correct_answer": "a",
      "explanation": "The X-ray image shows a Chance fracture, which is by definition unstable as it can involve middle \nand posterior columns. Chance fracture is also known as seat-belt injury or the jack-knife injury. This injury is typically \nlocated in the upper lumbar spine in people involved in motor vehicle collisions while wearing a \nlap seat-belt without a shoulder harness. The sudden deceleration causes flexion and posterior \ndistraction of the spine. This causes the mid-lumbar spine to bend like a jack-knife around an axis \nanterior to the vertebral column. There is a tear in the vertebra that passes transversely through the bones (bony Chance fracture), \nor the ligamentous structures (soft Chance fracture), or both. There is little or no crushing of the \nvertebral body. However, it is an unstable injury as the posterior and middle columns are \ndistracted. Neurological damage is uncommon. Associated intra-abdominal injuries are seen in \n50% of these injuries. 233 \nSold by @itachibot X- rays may show a horizontal fracture with the split running through the vertebra. It may involve \nthe spinous process, the transverse processes, pedicles and the vertebral body. There may be \nopening up of the disc space posteriorly. Most Chance fractures can be managed conservatively with bed rest and bracing. If posterior \nfixation is done, it will allow early mobilization. Ligamentous Chance fractures require posterior \ninstrumented fusion.",

      "explanation": "Vertebroplasty is a procedure of injecting liquid bone cement into the vertebral body. In vertebroplasty, polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA) is injected percutaneously into the vertebra \nthrough the pedicle to maintain the vertebral height. In kyphoplasty, a balloon is used to expand a \ncompression fracture to regain height before the PMMA is injected. Indications for these 2 minimally invasive procedures include: • Pathological vertebral body fractures caused due to osteoporosis, metastatic carcinoma, or \nmultiple myeloma. • In some cases of stable compression fractures with no neurological deficits, to manage persistent \npain due to the collapse. • Kyphoplasty has been used to correct sagittal deformity and prevent kyphosis Risks of these procedures include the possibility of disruption of the posterior cortex and cement \nmaterial leaking out into the spinal canal and causing neurological deficits. Therefore, these \nprocedures must be done after careful consideration.
