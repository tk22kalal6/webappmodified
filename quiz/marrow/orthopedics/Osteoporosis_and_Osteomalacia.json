      "explanation": "Given the clinical history of an elderly woman experiencing a fracture following a trivial fall, \nwhich indicates a pathological fracture, the most probable predisposing condition would be \nosteoporosis. Osteoporosis is the most common metabolic bone disorder characterized by abnormally low bone \nmass, which makes the bone unusually fragile and increases the risk of fractures. A DEXA scan is performed in the following patients to assess bone mineral density and screen for \nosteoporosis, and the results are reported in terms of T-score or Z-score: • Females aged 65 years or more • Males aged 70 years or more • Post-menopausal females under the age of 65 years with risk factors • Fracture after the age of 50 years • Males aged 50-69 with risk factors",

      "correct_answer": "b",
      "explanation": "Zoledronate is bisphosphonate that is administered once a year. The drugs used in the treatment of osteoporosis which decrease bone resorption include \nbisphosphonates, denosumab, and SERMs (selective estrogen receptor modulators). 372 \nSold by @itachibot Bisphosphonates decrease bone resorption by impairing osteoclast function. The bisphosphonates \napproved for the treatment of osteoporosis are alendronate, risedronate, ibandronate, and \nzoledronate. • Alendronate and risedronate can be administered daily or weekly with different dosages. • Ibandronate can be administered daily, weekly or quarterly. • Zoledronate is administered annually. Denosumab is a monoclonal antibody with an affinity for RANKL. RANKL stimulates osteoclast \nthat results in bone resorption. By inhibiting the RANKL, denosumab prevents activation of \nosteoclast and decreases bone resorption. SERMs: Raloxifene and tamoxifen are approved for the treatment of osteoporosis. Estrogen \ndecreases bone resorption. Thus decrease in estrogen in postmenopausal females results in \nincreased bone resorption leading to osteoporosis.",

In low and \nintermittent doses, it leads to bone formation.In high and continuous doses, it leads to bone \nresorption. Option B: Romosozumab is an anti- sclerostin antibody. Sclerostin inhibition increases bone \nformation and, to a lesser extent, decreases bone resorption. Option C: Cinacalcet inhibits the parathyroid hormone secretion by activating the calcium-sensing \nreceptors (CaSR). Option D: Salcatonin inhibits osteoclastic bone resorption.

Osteoporosis is a common metabolic bone disease characterised by a diffuse reduction in bone \ndensity due to a decrease in bone mass. Risk factors for osteoporosis include: • Increasing age • Female sex • Alcohol • Smoking • Previous history of fragility fractures • Family history of hip fracture • Low body mass index- less than 18.5 kg/m2 • Excessive usage of glucocorticoids Osteoporosis presents with fractures that occur without any trauma or as a result of low-impact \ntrauma. The commonly associated fractures are fractures of the distal part of the radius (Colle's \nfracture), fractures of the hip, and fractures of the vertebrae. In severe cases, the fracture of \nvertebrae can cause kyphosis. Radiological findings: • A decreased vertical height of the vertebra due to collapse • Ground glass appearance - especially in bones like pelvis • Codfish appearance - it occurs due to bulging of the disc into the adjacent vertebral bodies so \nthat it becomes biconcave. DEXA (dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry) is the investigation of choice for the diagnosis of \nosteoporosis.
