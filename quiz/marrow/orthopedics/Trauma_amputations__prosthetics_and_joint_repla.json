      "correct_answer": "c",
      "explanation": "Peripheral vascular disease is the most common cause of amputations. Amputation is defined as removal of the limb through a part of the bone. Disarticulation is the \nremoval of the limb through the joint. Causes of amputations can be classified into 3Ds: 1. Dead • Peripheral vascular disease • Severe trauma • Burns • Frostbite 2. Dangerous • Malignant tumour • Potentially lethal sepsis • Crush injury 3. Damned nuisance • Severe pain • Gross malformation 532 \nSold by @itachibot • Recurrent sepsis • Severe loss of function Note: In India, road traffic accidents (RTAs) are the top cause, while globally, peripheral vascular \ndiseases, often linked to diabetes, are more common. Overall, peripheral vascular disease occurs \nmore frequently than RTAs worldwide, unless the question specifies the primary cause in India, \nwhich would be crush injuries from RTAs.",

Other scores to assess if the limb is salvageable or not are: • Limb salvage index • Ganga score Option A: Gustilo Anderson Classification is used to classify open fractures.

      "correct_answer": "c",
      "explanation": "Revision of transtibial amputation should be done in a patient experiencing exquisite neurogenic \npain with ambulation as buried tibial nerve can form postoperative neuroma. Transected nerves should not be buried, placed on tension, or compressed as doing so will \npromote the development of a postoperative neuroma. They should simply be transected sharply \nand allowed to retract into the soft tissues proximally. Transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS) is the use of electric current produced by a \ndevice to stimulate the nerves for the treatment of mild to moderate pain in acute or chronic \nsetting. Interferential current therapy (ICT) is another variant of TENS, but works at a much \ndeeper level of the targeted tissue.",

An example of open degloving injury is finger avulsion \ninjury with loss of skin. Closed degloving injuries result from shearing forces (e.g. motor vehicle \ncollisions). The extent of degloving injuries are often underappreciated and much of the skin may be \nnon-viable. Disruption of perforating vascular and lymphatic vessels may result in a characteristic \nhaemolymphatic collection between the fascial planes called a Morel-Lavallée lesion. Patterns of degloving injury: • Limited degloving with abrasion or avulsion • Non-circumferential degloving • Circumferential single plane degloving • Circumferential multiplanar degloving Assessing the viability of degloved tissue can be difficult and may therefore require more than one \nsurgical exploration and debridement before definitive reconstruction. Non-viable skin may show \nfixed staining and thrombosis of subcutaneous veins. Most surgeons serially excise the degloved \nskin until punctate dermal bleeding is seen from viable tissue. Intravenous fluorescein can help in delineating non-viable tissue, but it requires specialist \nequipment and there is a small risk of anaphylaxis. Indocyanine green has been found to have less 539 \nSold by @itachibot risk of allergy. Open degloving injuries are managed by reattaching the viable skin and grafting. Closed degloving \ninjuries are managed by draining the accumulated fluid, removing the dead tissue and \nsclerotherapy. For severe, multiplanar degloving, amputation is done.
