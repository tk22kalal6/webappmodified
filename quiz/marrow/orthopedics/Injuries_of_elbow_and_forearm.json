      "correct_answer": "a",
      "explanation": "Posterior displacement or extension type is more common in supracondylar fracture of the \nhumerus. It is the most common fracture following a fall on an outstretched hand. Most commonly seen in \nchildren between 5-8 years of age. On examination, an S-shaped deformity may be seen at the \nelbow. If the proximal fracture fragment is sharp and has penetrated the muscles and fascia, a \ndimple may be seen on the skin above the elbow (dimple sign). Fractures are broadly classified into either extension or flexion types. Extension type fractures are \nfurther classified using Gartland's classification as: • Type I - Undisplaced fractures • Type II - Displaced fractures but with intact posterior cortex • Type III - Displaced fractures, with no intact posterior cortex, and the fragment may be \ndisplaced either posteromedially or posterolaterally Characteristic displacements (MID) include medial rotation/ medial tilt, impaction/ proximal shift, \ndorsal displacement/ dorsal tilt. 91 \nSold by @itachibot On radiology: • Sail sign/ fat pad sign - an undisplaced fracture may show a triangular lucency like a sail of a \nyacht. This is due to the fat pad around the elbow being pushed forward by hematoma • Fish-tail sign - due to rotation of the distal fragment, the anterior border of the proximal \nfragment looks like a sharp spike • Baumann’s angle / humeral-capitellar angle - can help in assessing the degree of medial \nangulation before reduction Treatment includes: • Undisplaced fractures - immobilization at 90 degrees flexion in a cast for 3 weeks • Comminuted or compound fractures - Dunlop's (skin) or Smith's (skeletal) traction • Displaced fractures - closed reduction with percutaneous fixation 92 \nSold by @itachibot In open or severely displaced fractures or fractures with vascular damage, open \nreduction with K-wire fixation is indicated.",

Cubitus \nvalgus is a very rare complication. Cubitus varus is characterized by posterior displacement, horizontal rotation, and coronal tilt of \nthe distal fragment. Correction methods include: • Lateral closed-wedge osteotomy • Medial open-wedge osteotomy (King's osteotomy) The images below shows gunstock deformity. 93 \nSold by @itachibot Complications of supracondylar fracture of the humerus can occur early or late. Early complications : • Vascular injury - to the brachial artery resulting in • Volkmann's ischemia • Compartment syndrome • Volkmann’s ischemic contracture • Nerve injury - to the anterior interosseus nerve&gt; median &gt;radial &gt;ulnar nerve Late complications : • Gunstock deformity • Elbow stiffness • Heterotopic ossification (myositis ossificans) Patients with anterior interosseous nerve injury are unable to perform the OK sign. This is due \nto weak flexor digitorum profundus and flexor pollicis longus muscles. The fingers get pinched, \nand instead of the tips, the volar surfaces of the thumb and index finger make contact.",

      "correct_answer": "a",
      "explanation": "The given scenario of spinning the child by holding his hands, followed by features suggesting \npain and inability to use the arm, points to a diagnosis of pulled elbow. Pulled elbow or nursemaid's elbow refers to the dislocation of the radial head over the annular \nligament, commonly seen in children under the age of 6 years. The mechanism of injury is \nthrough axial traction on the extended and pronated forearm. This happens when a child is \npulled, lifted, or swung by the arm. Following the dislocation, the child holds the arm relatively immobile, with the elbow extended \nand the forearm pronated, and resists supination. The diagnosis is primarily clinical, though X-rays are usually obtained to exclude a fracture. To treat the condition, simple analgesia is administered, and while the child's attention is \ndiverted, the elbow is extended and pronated to relocate the radial head with a snap. This \ntechnique is preferred over the alternative method of supination and flexion, which tends to be \nmore painful and less successful. 95 \nSold by @itachibot",

Characteristically, the child holds the elbow in extension with the forearm pronated (Option A) \nand resists supination. The treatment is done under simple analgesia (Option B) and the procedure is attempted while \ndiverting the child's attention. There are two methods to treat this condition: • Extension and pronation: In this technique, the elbow is extended and pronated (Option D) to \nrelocate the radial head with a snap. This technique is reported to be more successful and less \npainful and, hence, is the preferred treatment. • Supination and flexion: The elbow is supinated and flexed to relocate the radial head within the \nannular ligament.",

These dislocations occur with a progression from lateral to the medial side, termed as Hori’s \ncircle.
