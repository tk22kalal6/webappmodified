      "correct_answer": "d",
      "explanation": "Adduction of the forefoot is a primary deformity in congenital talipes equinus varus (CTEV). The five primary deformities in CTEV are: • Cavus- excessive arching of the foot • Adduction of forefoot • Varus- inversion and adduction of foot • Equinus- increased plantar flexion • Internal tibial torsion- medial rotation of the tibia",

      },
      "correct_answer": "c",
      "explanation": "The plumb line test helps to detect tibial torsion which is seen in congenital talipes equinus varus \n(CTEV). The child is made to sit at a table with both the lower limbs hanging from the edge. A line is \ndrawn from the center of the patella to the tibial tubercle. This is called the plumb line. Normally, when extended down, it should cut the foot at the first or second inter-metatarsal \nspace. 330 \nSold by @itachibot In CTEV, due to medial rotation of the tibia plumb line cuts the third or fourth inter-metatarsal \nspace. Option A: A dorsiflexion test is done in the screening of clubfoot. In a newborn, the dorsum of the \nfoot can be brought in contact with the tibia by dorsiflexion but not in CTEV. Options B and D: Ortolani's and Barlow's tests are performed in developmental dysplasia of the \nhip (DDH).",

      "explanation": "332 \nSold by @itachibot The next best step, in this case, is posteromedial soft tissue release (PMSTR), also known as \nTurco's procedure. By 1 year of age, posteromedial soft tissue gets contracted. This causes difficulty in the \nmanipulation of the joint. Therefore, PMSTR is done and tight soft tissue structures (tendons, \nligaments, capsule) on the posterior and medial side of the foot are cut.",

CTEV shoes are prescribed when the child starts walking and are used up to 5 years of age. \nThe straight inner border prevents adduction, while the absence of heel prevents the equinus. \nAn outer shoe raise is present to prevent foot inversion. 333 \nSold by @itachibot",

      "explanation": "The talocrural joint (ankle joint) is not involved in triple arthrodesis. Triple arthrodesis involves the fusion of talonavicular, talocalcaneal and calcaneocuboid joints. Triple arthrodesis is done for recurrent or persistent clubfoot deformity in older children (chronic \ncases). It is done after 10-12 years of age as before this age bones are not fully ossified, therefore \nfusion may not be adequate. Inadequate fusion is known as pseudoarthrosis.",

Any increase or decrease \nin angle can result in knee deformities. Knee deformities are: • Genu valgus (valgum) or knock knee - Knees are abnormally approximated and the ankles are \ndivergent. • Genu varus (varum) or bow knee - Knees are abnormally divergent and the ankles are \napproximated. • Windswept deformity - Abnormal valgus deformity of one knee with varus of the other. • Genu recurvatum - Hyperextension at the knee joint with backwards bending.",

Fracture of lateral condyle femur will result in injury to the lateral growth plate of the femur, and \nthus only the medial condyle will continue to grow with age resulting in genu valgus.
