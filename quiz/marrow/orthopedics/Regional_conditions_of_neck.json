The classic clinical triad seen in this condition includes: 53 \nSold by @itachibot • Short neck • Low posterior hairline • Limited range of neck motion Klippel-Feil syndrome is a developmental disorder caused by a failure of normal segmentation of \nthe cervical somites during the 3rd to 8th week of embryogenesis. This results in a congenital \nfusion of at least 2 cervical vertebrae, sometimes a block of cervical vertebrae, and rarely the \nentire cervical spine. X- rays may show the fusion of two or more cervical vertebrae. The vertebrae are also widened and \nflattened (wasp-waist appearance).

      "explanation": "The image shows an upward elevation of the scapula relative to the thoracic cage characteristically \nseen in Sprengel deformity. Sprengel deformity is a congenital upward elevation of the scapula. It is due to the failure of the \nscapula to descend completely in embryonic life. The affected scapula is smaller, shaped differently, abnormally high, and somewhat prominent. \nShoulder movements are usually painless. Abduction and elevation of shoulders may be limited \ndue to fixation of the scapula. The Cavendish classification is used to grade the severity of Sprengel deformity. If the deformity is mild, no treatment is required. In severe deformity, surgery may be indicated. \nThese procedures include: • Green procedure • Woodward procedure • Mears procedure",

      "correct_answer": "d",
      "explanation": "Basilar impression (basilar invagination) is a deformity in which there is an indention of the skull \nfloor by the upper cervical spine. Basilar invagination is invagination (infolding) of the base of the skull that occurs when the top of \nthe C2 vertebra migrates upward. It can cause narrowing of the foramen magnum (the opening in \nthe skull where the spinal cord passes through to the brain). It also may press on the lower \nbrainstem. Basilar impression can be primary (congenital) or secondary (acquired). • Primary: Congenital defect in bone development at the craniocervical junction. The tip of the \nodontoid bone is more cranial than normal. • Secondary: Acquired deformity due to systemic diseases that affect bony structures at the base of \nthe skull. Neurologic symptoms are seen due to pressure on the brainstem such as weakness and \nparesthesia in the limbs. There can be symptoms related to compression of cranial nerves \n(trigeminal, vagus, glossopharyngeal, hypoglossal) and the vertebral artery. 56 \nSold by @itachibot Craniometric parameters used for diagnosis include McRae’s line, Chamberlain’s line, and \nMcGregor’s line. Treatment is by surgical decompression and stabilization with a posterior occipito-cervical \narthrodesis. Odontoidectomy is done if compression is due to aberrant odontoid. The below image shows basilar invagination in an infant with indentation of the medulla \noblongata by the odontoid process.",

Allen's test is mainly used to test the adequacy of ulnar collateral blood flow to the hand, which is \nusually done prior to radial artery cannulation. Procedure: • The radial and ulnar arteries are occluded as the patient makes a tight fist so as to exsanguinate \nthe palm. 58 \nSold by @itachibot • Then the patient is asked to open the hand and the occlusion over the ulnar artery is released. Interpretation: • As occlusion of the ulnar artery is released, the color of the open palm is observed. Normally, the \ncolor will return to the palm within 5 – 6 seconds. • If the palm remains pale for more than 6-10 seconds, it indicates reduced ulnar collateral flow. • The modified Allen’s test considers a threshold of 5 to 15 seconds. Clinical significance: • In recent years, studies have shown that, although the Allen test is often used to identify patients \nat increased risk for ischemic complications from radial artery cannulation, the predictive value of \nthis test is poor. • It is also used for identifying patients acceptable for radial artery harvest or use for coronary \nangiography.",
