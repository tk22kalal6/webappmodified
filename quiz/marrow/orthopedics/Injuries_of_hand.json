      "correct_answer": "a",
      "explanation": "The scaphoid (labelled as A) is the most commonly fractured carpal bone after a fall on an \noutstretched hand. It is more susceptible to fracture because it lies obliquely across the two rows of carpal bones. It \nalso lies along the line of loading (i.e, in the line of weight transmission) between the forearm and \nthumb. A combination of forced carpal movement and compression, such as in a fall on the \ndorsiflexed (outstretched) hand, exerts severe stress on the scaphoid making it liable to fracture. Due to its blood supply originating from the dorsal distal pole, the scaphoid's proximal pole \npossesses a poor blood flow, making it less prone to heal and resulting in non-union. 112 \nSold by @itachibot",

      "correct_answer": "b",
      "explanation": "The given clinical presentation and the x-ray are suggestive of scaphoid fracture. Nonunion is a \ncommon complication of this condition, while malunion is rare. Scaphoid fracture characteristically presents with tenderness in the anatomical snuffbox following \na fall on an outstretched hand. Recent fractures are less likely to be visible on AP view x-ray, hence oblique x-ray view is \npreferred. Common complications of scaphoid fracture include: • Non-union and delayed union • Avascular necrosis • Wrist osteoarthritis Treatment includes: • Undisplaced fractures - immobilization in a scaphoid cast applied in a glass-holding position • Displaced fractures - open reduction and internal fixation using Herbert's screw The below image shows a Herbert screw. 113 \nSold by @itachibot",

      },
      "correct_answer": "a",
      "explanation": "Among the given options, statement A is incorrect. A fall on a dorsiflexed hand may tear the tough ligaments that normally bind the carpal bones, \nleading to dislocations. In peri-lunate dislocation, the lunate remains in position in the lunate \nfossa of the distal radius but the rest of the carpals dislocate dorsally. It is frequently associated \nwith compression of the median nerve. Prompt reduction reduces swelling and potential damage to the median nerve. The Tavernier \nmaneuver is the most commonly used method of closed reduction. It involves locking the capitate \ninto the distal concavity of the lunate. If the injury cannot be reduced using this method, urgent \nreduction in the theater should be performed. In lunate dislocation, the lunate dislocates anteriorly while the rest of the carpal bones remain in \nplace. 114 \nSold by @itachibot",

      "explanation": "Terry–Thomas sign is most likely to be seen in patients with scapholunate instability. It denotes the increased gap between the scaphoid and the lunate. A scapholunate gap of &gt;3 \nmm is suggestive of instability. It results from tearing of the scapholunate ligament following a fall \non an outstretched hand.

The small fractured fragment remains in contact with the trapezium but the rest of the metacarpal \nshaft is pulled proximally by the abductor pollicis longus tendon that is attached to its base. In contrast, the comminuted fracture line of Rolando's fracture prevents the pull of the abductor \npollicis longus tendon from being exerted on the metacarpal shaft. 116 \nSold by @itachibot",

The strength of grip decreases in this fracture as the fourth and \nfifth fingers are responsible for the power grip of the hand. Boxer's fracture is caused by striking an object with a closed fist, as seen in boxing, or occasionally \nby a direct injury. 117 \nSold by @itachibot The POP cast is applied in James' position/the position of safe immobilization for metacarpal \nfractures. Position of safe immobilization: • Wrist slightly extended • MCP joints in full flexion and the IP joints extended • Thumb in abduction This prevents stiffness and contractures as the ligaments are at their longest in this position.",

Mallet finger is also known as baseball finger. It is caused by the disruption of the extensor tendon \nat the distal interphalangeal joint.
