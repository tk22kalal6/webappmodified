      "explanation": "The partial tear of the supraspinatus tendon is responsible for painful arc syndrome rather than a \ncomplete tear. Painful arc syndrome, also known as impingement syndrome is a condition where there is pain in \nthe shoulder and upper arm during the mid-range of shoulder abduction (between 60-120 \ndegrees), arising due to repetitive rubbing of the supraspinatus tendon under the coracoacromial \narch. 126 \nSold by @itachibot Causes include: • Minor tears of the supraspinatus tendon • Supraspinatus tendinitis • Calcification of supraspinatus tendon • Fracture of greater tuberosity • Subacromial bursitis Important tests for impingement are: • Painful arc test • Hawkin-Kennedy's test • Neer's impingement sign • Jobe's test Investigations: • An x-ray of the shoulder helps to detect bony avulsions, spurs, calcific deposits, sclerotic areas \netc. • Ultrasound of the shoulder joint is highly reliable with a sensitivity of 98%. • Single contrast arthrogram is considered the gold standard in diagnosing rotator cuff tears Management: • Conservative: heat massage, exercises, NSAIDs, subacromial steroid injections, and temporary \nimmobilization (90% of patients recover with these measures). • Indications for surgery include failure of conservative measures for 3 months, increasing loss of \nshoulder function, and patients who are young and active. • Surgical techniques include excision of adhesions and manipulation of the shoulder, excision of \ncalcium deposits, repair of incomplete tear, acromioplasty, acromionectomy for more disabling \npain with normal range of movements, direct suture for complete rupture of the rotator cuff, \nrotation and transposition of the flap, and free graft. 127 \nSold by @itachibot 128 \nSold by @itachibot",

Olecranon bursitis is a chronic inflammation of the olecranon bursa, as a result of repetitive \nminor injuries. It is seen in people who tend to keep their elbow rubbed against the desk. The \nconstant friction against the olecranon bursa can lead to the development of bursitis. Culture and aspiration of the bursa fluid are done to rule out infection.

      "explanation": "De Quervain's disease classically affects extensor pollicis brevis and abductor pollicis longus. De Quervain's disease is a stenosing tenosynovitis of the extensor tendons of the first dorsal \ncompartment, namely extensor pollicis brevis (EPB) and abductor pollicis longus (APL). It \ninvolves noninflammatory thickening of both the tendons and the tunnel or sheath through which \nthey pass. This condition is prominent among females, especially women of childbearing age. Key diagnostic factors: • History of joint overuse at home or at work. • Pain and tenderness at the tip of the radial styloid. • Positive Finkelstein test: The examiner grasps the thumb of the patient and abducts the hand \ntowards the ulnar side. This causes severe pain over the tip of the styloid process Treatment in most patients includes conservative management with splinting and steroid \ninjections. Only a few patients require surgical release of the 1st dorsal compartment (housing the \nAPL and EPB tendons).",

      "explanation": "130 \nSold by @itachibot Finkelstein's test is negative ulnar nerve entrapment. Finkelstein's test: Examiner holds the patient’s hand with his thumb tucked firmly and then flexes into the palm; \nthen turn the wrist into full ulnar deviation; in a positive test, this will elicit sharp pain in the \naffected sheath. The pain over the radial styloid tip is excruciating. It is positive in the following conditions: • De Quervain's tenosynovitis • Arthritis in the intercarpal and radiocarpal joints • Radial nerve entrapment • Intersection syndrome i.e. tenosynovitis occurring due to friction between the obliquely placed \nextensor and abductor pollicis tendons and the longitudinally placed extensor tendons. Finkelstein stated that this test is “probably the most pathognomonic objective sign Note: Finkelstein's test is commonly confused with Eichhoff's test: Eichhoff's test is typically \ndescribed as the examiner ulnar deviating the hand when the person has their thumb held within \ntheir fist. If sharp pain occurs along the distal radius, De Quervain's tenosynovitis is suspected. 131 \nSold by @itachibot",

      "correct_answer": "b",
      "explanation": "The clinical scenario along with the video showing the middle finger in the flexed position \nrequiring extra force to extend it is suggestive of a trigger finger. Trigger finger is caused by stenosing tenosynovitis of the flexor sheath. There is nodular or \nfusiform swelling on the flexor tendon that prevents it from moving along the A1 pulley. A1 pulley is an annular ligament that acts as a belt that straps the flexor tendon to the underlying \nphalanges. There are 5 annular ligaments in each finger namely A1. A2, A3, A4, and A5. The image given below is showing the nodule in the flexor tendon and the 5 annular ligaments of \nthe finger. 132 \nSold by @itachibot When the finger is flexed or extended, the nodular swelling passes through the A1 pulley with a \nsnap, leading to a triggering effect. The nodule can get trapped behind the A1 pulley leading to a \nlocking of the finger in flexion. Surgical treatment involves the release of the A1 pulley, which is thickened and fibrosed.",

The volar plate is not involved in partial rupture, it is involved only in \ncomplete rupture. It can be caused either by fall on extended thumb (forcing it into hyperabduction) or by repeated \nvalgus stress (i.e. radial deviation) on the thumb which occurs during twisting movement of the \nhand. This type of injury was seen in gamekeepers who used to twist the neck of small animals \nwith their thumb and index finger. The ulnar collateral ligament keeps the thumb stable in flexion and the volar plate keeps the \nthumb stable in extension. In a partial rupture: • Only the ligament is torn and the thumb is unstable only in flexion • The volar plate is intact, keeping the thumb stable in extension In a complete rupture: • Both the ligament and the volar plate are torn • The thumb is unstable in all positions 134 \nSold by @itachibot Dislocations of the Hip joint",
