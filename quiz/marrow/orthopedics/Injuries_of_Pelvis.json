      "correct_answer": "a",
      "explanation": "Rotationally unstable, but vertically stable pelvic ring fractures are classified as Tile type B. Two classification systems are used in the evaluation of pelvic ring fractures: 1. The Tile classification provides an assessment of the stability of the pelvis. It helps the surgeon \npredict the need for surgery. Pelvic ring fractures are classified into 3 types: 2. The Young and Burgess classification is based on the mechanism of injury. It helps the surgeon \npredict the severity of the injury, blood loss, and deformity or displacement. Note: Neer classification is used for proximal humerus fractures. Tile classification \nStability \nManagement Conservative Type A \nRotationally and verticallysta \nble Type B \nRotationally unstable and ver \ntically stable External fixation is used for \ndefinitive management. Ante \nrior fixation is additionally d \none if pubic bones have separ \nated by more than 2.5 cm. Type C \nRotationally and verticallyun \nstable Posterior fixation is done for \nvertical stability along with e \nxternal fixation.",

      },
      "correct_answer": "d",
      "explanation": "Isolated pubic diastasis is not a criterion for unstable pelvic injury. For the pubic diastasis to be \nconsidered unstable, it must be accompanied with posterior ring injury or injury of sacro-tuberous \nor sacro-spinous ligaments. Radiographic factors indicating unstable pelvic injury include: • Sacroiliac joint disruption &gt;1 cm. • Gap in posterior pelvic ring. 274 \nSold by @itachibot • Avulsion fracture of L5 transverse process or sacrotuberous or sacrospinous ligament. • Pubic diastasis of &gt; 2 cm along with posterior ring injury or sacro-tuberous ligament or \nsacrospinous ligament.",

      "explanation": "The fracture shown in the image is known as Malgaigne's fracture. This fracture involves the pubic rami anteriorly and the sacroiliac joint (SI joint) or ilium near the \nSI joint on the same side posteriorly. Chauffeur's fracture refers to fracture of the radial styloid process in the forearm. Open book fracture are associated with pubic diastasis and/or a fracture of the pubic rami with a \nposterior pelvic disruption of the sacro-iliac joint. Bucket handle fracture refers to a vertically orientated fracture through ipsilateral superior and \ninferior pubic rami with contralateral sacroiliac joint disruption. 275 \nSold by @itachibot",

      "explanation": "Jumper’s fracture is H or U-shaped fracture of the sacrum. These are called jumper's or suicide jumper's fracture as they are seen in falls from height. There \nare two longitudinal fractures that run through the sacral foramina and a transverse fracture. The \nlevel of the transverse fracture line determines if it is H or U shaped. As these fractures pass through the sacral foramina, they can cause injury to the spinal cord and \nresult in cauda equina syndrome.",

      "correct_answer": "c",
      "explanation": "Acute haemorrhage leading to hypovolemic shock is the most common complication of pelvic \nfractures. In fractures of the pelvic ring, there is a risk of injury to the major vessels (internal iliac and \nexternal iliac vessels) and to the venous plexus around the sacroiliac joint. Bleeding from the \nvenous plexus is the major cause of pelvic haemorrhage. Potential blood loss in fractures is given below: Pelvic fractures have a high mortality rate ranging from 10% to 50% in some open pelvic \nfractures. Early mortality is mostly the result of haemorrhage. Late mortality occurs from sepsis \nor multiple system organ failure.

      "explanation": "Closed degloving soft tissue injuries associated with pelvic and acetabular fractures are known \nas Morel-Lavallee lesions. 277 \nSold by @itachibot Morel-Lavallee lesion involves separation of skin from the underlying fascia. They are frequently \nseen in pelvic fractures due to motor vehicle accidents and other crush injuries. The shearing force \nin these injuries creates a pocket between skin and fascia where a considerable amount of blood \ncan collect. MRI and ultrasonography are recommended to confirm the diagnosis. Complications of Morel-Lavallee lesions include infection, subcutaneous fat necrosis, and necrosis \nof the overlying skin. These lesions are managed through incisional drainage, debridement, and \nirrigation of the wound.",

      },
      "correct_answer": "d",
      "explanation": "Spur sign is seen in bicolumnar acetabular fractures. Bicolumnar fractures cause disruption of both the anterior and posterior columns on the \nacetabulum. Due to the fracture in the acetabulum, the femoral head migrates medially. The \nunsupported triangular area of the ilium is then seen laterally as the spur sign. It is best seen on \nobturator oblique view radiographs. The obturator oblique X-ray image of pelvis shows a comminuted left acetabular fracture affecting \nboth the columns (disruption of both the iliopectineal and ilioischial lines). The left ilium is seen \npointing laterally (spur sign). Posterior wall fractures are the most common type of acetabular fractures. Letournel and Judet \nclassification is used to classify acetabular fractures. Judet view (45-degree oblique) and AP views are used to radiographically evaluate acetabular \nfractures.",

      "explanation": "278 \nSold by @itachibot The posterior approach used in acetabular fractures is known as the Kocher-Langenbeck \napproach. The surgical approaches used in the management of acetabular fractures include: • Kocher-Langenbeck approach is the posterior approach that provides access to the posterior \nwall, posterior column, and to transverse fractures. It is also used for handling sciatic nerve \ninjuries. • The ilioinguinal approach provides access to the entire anterior column, symphysis pubis, ilium, \nand sacroiliac joint. The Stoppa approach is a modification of the ilioinguinal approach. • The iliofemoral approach is a lateral approach that is rarely used nowadays due to the high rate \nof complication. 279 \nSold by @itachibot Infections of the bone",
