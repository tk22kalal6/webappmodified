      "explanation": "The test shown in the image is the anterior drawer test. This is done to detect injuries to the \nanterior cruciate ligament (ACL). The patient is made to lie supine on the examining table. The hip is flexed to 45° and the knee is \nflexed to 90° with the foot flat on the examination table. The upper end of the tibia is held in both \nhands and is gently pulled anteriorly. Increased displacement compared to the normal knee \nindicates injury to the ACL. Lachman test is also done to detect injuries to the anterior cruciate ligament. Here the leg is in \nslight external rotation and the knee is in a mid-flexed to 20° position. One hand is placed to \nstabilize the femur, while another hand applies the anterior force to the proximal tibia, as shown \nbelow. 546 \nSold by @itachibot Apley's grinding test and McMurray's test are done to detect meniscal injuries.",

      "question": "Question 2: A young footballer is brought to the OPD by his teammates. He says that while tackling his \nopponent, he had heard a sudden 'pop' followed by severe pain in his right knee. On \nexamination, the joint appears slightly swollen. Which of the following statements is false \nabout his injury?",
      "options": {
        "a": "It is a component of the O' Donoghue triad",
        "b": "It can lead to hemarthrosis",

        "d": "Intercondylar fractures of tibia can lead to this injury"
      },
      "correct_answer": "c",
      "explanation": "The above clinical scenario points to a diagnosis of anterior cruciate ligament injury. Lachman \ntest is preferred in a swollen and acutely painful knee. The anterior drawer test is not preferred in a painful knee, as it may not be possible to carry out \nthe test in the conventional 90° flexed position. Lachman test: The leg is kept in slight external rotation and the knee is in a position between \nflexion and extension. One hand is placed to stabilize the femur, while another hand applies the \nanterior force to the proximal tibia, as shown below. 547 \nSold by @itachibot The ACL is an intraarticular extra-synovial structure. Hence patients with an ACL injury can \npresent with hemarthrosis. It is attached to the intercondylar area of the tibia, therefore \nintercondylar tibial fractures can lead to ACL injury.",

      "question": "Question 4: A 26-year old athlete presented with sudden pain in her right knee after performing a heavy \ndeadlift. On examination of the joint, swelling is present and McMurray's test is positive. X- ray appears normal. Which of the following structures is likely to be injured?",

      "correct_answer": "c",
      "explanation": "The given clinical scenario and a positive McMurray's test indicate a meniscal injury. In this test, the patient is made to lie in the supine position and the knee is completely flexed. One \nhand is used to stabilize and palpate the knee joint, while the other hand is used to internally or \nexternally rotate the leg, depending on which meniscus is to be tested. The leg is then slowly \nextended. Any palpable or audible click indicates injury to the menisci. Other tests used to detect meniscal injury include: • Apley's grinding test • Thessaly test • Squat test • Ege's test • Joint line tenderness test 548 \nSold by @itachibot Apley's test: In this test, the patient is made to lie in the prone position. The knee is flexed to 90º \nand rotated while a compression force is applied, which is called the grinding test. The \nreproduction of symptoms indicates a torn meniscus. The distraction test involves repeated \nrotation while the leg is pulled upwards by the examiner, holding the thigh down. This produces \nincreased pain only if there is ligament damage. Thessaly test: With the affected knee flexed to 20º and the foot placed flat on the ground, the \npatient bears his full weight on that leg while being supported by the examiner. The patient is \nthen asked to twist his or her body to one side and then to the other three times. This test has \nshown a high diagnostic accuracy rate (95%) in detecting meniscal tears.",

      },
      "correct_answer": "b",
      "explanation": "Meniscal injury is mainly caused by rotational force on a partially flexed knee. 549 \nSold by @itachibot The rotational forces at the knee compress and rotate the menisci anteriorly or posteriorly, \ncausing a tear. The medial meniscus is less mobile than the lateral meniscus and hence is more \nprone to injury.",

      },
      "correct_answer": "b",
      "explanation": "In a patient with an injury to the tibial (medial) collateral ligament, the abduction or valgus stress \ntest would be positive. The abduction or valgus stress test is done as follows: • The patient is made to lie in the supine position. • One hand of the examiner is placed on the lateral aspect of the knee for support. • The other hand is placed over the ankle. • Gentle abduction or valgus stress is applied to the knee while the hand at the ankle externally \nrotates the leg slightly, and the knee is flexed to 30°. The test is said to be positive when pain is reproduced, or there is excessive gapping at the medial \njoint. The below image shows the abduction or valgus stress test. Adduction or varus stress test is positive in patients with a lateral collateral ligament injury. 550 \nSold by @itachibot Dial test is used to assess the posterolateral instability. This occurs when there is damage to the \nlateral collateral ligament, popliteofibular ligament, and popliteus tendon.",

      },
      "correct_answer": "d",
      "explanation": "Patella baja is an abnormally low-lying patella and is not responsible for recurrent dislocation of \nthe patella. Causes for recurrent dislocation of the patella include: • Excessive joint laxity as in connective tissue disorders like EDS, Marfan's syndrome • Patella alta - the patella is high-lying in the shallow part of the inter-condylar groove • Trochlear dysplasia • Small patella • Genu valgum Given below is a lateral radiograph of the knee joint showing the Insall-Salvati index. This is \nthe ratio of the patella tendon length (LT) to the length of the patella (LP). • In patients with high-lying patella, the ratio is above 1.2. This is known as patella alta. • In patients with low-lying patella, the ratio is below 0.8. This is known as patella baja.",

      "correct_answer": "c",
      "explanation": "The presence of swelling around the medial malleolus and increased medial joint space on \nradiography indicates injury to the deltoid ligament. The deltoid ligament is present on the medial side of the ankle joint and the fibers are attached to \nthe medial malleolus. Hence injury to it can lead to the widening of the medial joint space, best 551 \nSold by @itachibot visualized on the mortise view of an ankle radiograph.

      },
      "correct_answer": "c",
      "explanation": "The above clinical scenario and positive Thompson's test point to a diagnosis of Achilles tendon \nrupture. Achilles tendon rupture is usually seen in those playing sports like squash, badminton, and \nfootball. The pain is acute and the patient can feel a ripping or popping sensation at the back of \nthe heel. The patient would be unable to plantarflex the affected foot. In Thompson's test, the patient lies prone with his foot over the end of the examination table. The \nexaminer squeezes the calf muscles, specifically the gastrocnemius-soleus complex, with his hand. \nThis should normally cause contraction of the Achilles tendon, resulting in plantar flexion. If the \nAchilles tendon is completely ruptured, plantar flexion would be absent. Achilles tendinitis is usually seen in athletes, joggers, and hikers. It is caused due to the local \nirritation of the tendon sheath. Patients present with gradually progressive pain over the Achilles \ntendon. On examination, there may be thickening of the tendon with inflammation over the \naffected area. Ultrasound may be needed to exclude tendon tear or rupture. It is usually treated by \nphysiotherapy. 552 \nSold by @itachibot",
