      "correct_answer": "c",
      "explanation": "The earliest site of infection in acute hematogenous osteomyelitis is the metaphysis. It is also the \nmost common site of infection. The infection reaches metaphysis via the hematogenous route. The metaphysis is susceptible due \nto the following factors: • Hairpin loop arrangement of terminal blood vessels - leads to vascular stasis that favors bacterial \ncolonization • Fewer phagocytes in this area Apart from the hematogenous route, acute osteomyelitis can also occur by the exogenous route. \nThis includes open fractures, iatrogenic intervention, or spread from local infection.",

Redness, warmth, \nswelling, and edema are late features. It most commonly involves the proximal tibia or proximal \nand distal ends of the femur. It commonly occurs by hematogenous spread following toe infections, ear discharge, tooth \ninfection, sore throat, or a boil.

      "correct_answer": "c",
      "explanation": "Acute osteomyelitis is most likely to cause limb shortening and deformity in infants because of the \ninvolvement of the growth plate, epiphysis, and the adjacent joint. This occurs because the metaphyseal infection spreads via the blood vessels of the physis (growth \nplate) to the epiphysis and the adjacent joint. Hence, septic arthritis is frequently associated with \nacute osteomyelitis in infancy. The resulting damage to the growth plate and septic arthritis of the \nadjacent joint lead to limb shortening and deformity. Beyond 2 years of age, the physis acts as a barrier preventing the direct spread of metaphyseal \ninfection into the epiphysis. Hence, the metaphyseal infection more commonly spreads to the \ndiaphysis.",

Chronic osteomyelitis may occur by direct inoculation of the infective organism during trauma \n(like road traffic accidents). The infection continues to thrive within the bone leading to \nalternating quiescent and flare-up stages of chronic osteomyelitis. Sequestrum is a piece of dead bone. It is formed when a fragment of bone gets separated from the \nhealthy bone due to necrosis. It varies in size from a spicule to a large fragment and acts as a \nnidus for infection. It leads to abscess and persistent pus discharge in the bone. Sinus tracts are \nformed when the abscess from the infected bone drains out through the skin. The involucrum is the dense new sclerotic bone surrounding the sequestrum. It is formed from \ndeep layers of stripped periosteum. Cloacae are the perforations in the involucrum. Pus and tiny \nspicules of bone may be discharged through them.

Brodie's abscess is a localized form of subacute osteomyelitis that occurs when organisms of low \nvirulence infect an immunocompetent host. The abscess is walled off by the thickening of the \nsurrounding bone trabeculae. It most commonly involves the metaphysis of the proximal tibia and \ndistal femur. The patient is typically a child or adolescent experiencing prolonged pain near a large joint for \nseveral weeks or months. Symptoms may include a limp, slight swelling, muscle wasting, and \nlocalized tenderness. The typical radiographic finding is a circumscribed, round or oval radiolucent cavity measuring \n1-2 cm in diameter, surrounded by a halo of sclerosis, with minimal or no periosteal reaction. The \nradioisotope scan shows markedly increased activity. MRI may be helpful in diagnosis. Open \nbiopsy with curettage is indicated if there is any doubt in the diagnosis. Differential diagnoses include: • Cystic tuberculosis • Eosinophilic granuloma • Osteoid osteoma • Ewing's sarcoma Treatment: • Immobilization and antibiotics (flucloxacillin and fusidic acid) intravenous for 4-5 days, followed \nby oral administration for another 6 weeks; healing may take up to 12 months • Curettage is needed if the x-rays show no healing after conservative management.
