The patient was in a \nstate of confusion. Chest radiograph showed lung fields to be clear. What is the most likely \ndiagnosis?",

      "correct_answer": "b",
      "explanation": "In this clinical scenario, the presence of reduced SpO2 and altered mental status in a patient \npresenting within 72 hours following a long bone fracture suggests the diagnosis of a fat \nembolism. Fat embolism is caused by the fat globules originating from the bone marrow following the \nfracture of long bones. Clinical features of fat embolism are usually seen within 72 hours. They \ninclude tachycardia, fever, breathlessness, petechiae, confusion,and restlessness. Gurd's criteria is \nused for the diagnosis of fat embolism syndrome. 175 \nSold by @itachibot There is no specific diagnostic test for fat embolism. However, urine analysis to detect fat globules \nand monitoring of blood pO2 levels are conducted. The management of fat embolism primarily involves supportive care, including oxygen therapy \nand prompt stabilization of long-bone fractures. Option A: Pulmonary embolism most commonly occurs as a result of thrombi from deep vein \nthrombosis of the leg. Option C: Acute respiratory distress syndrome is diagnosed using the Berlin's criteria. All four of \nthe following conditions must be met: • It develops within 1 week of clinical insult or worsening respiratory symptoms. • Chest radiograph shows bilateral opacities consistent with pulmonary edema. These opacities \nare not fully explained by effusions, lobar or lung collapse, or nodules. • The edema is not due to cardiac failure, or fluid overload. • There is impaired oxygenation. The ratio of arterial oxygen partial pressure to the fraction of \ninspired oxygen (PaO2/FiO2) is  300 mmHg as assessed on 5 cm H2O of positive end-expiratory \npressure (PEEP). Option D: Occult pneumothorax is a condition that is not suspected on the basis of the symptoms \nor plain radiography, but is detected with CT imaging. It usually follows a thoracic injury.",
