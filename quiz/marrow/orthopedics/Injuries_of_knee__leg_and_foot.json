      "correct_answer": "b",
      "explanation": "The Insall-Salvati index is used for the determination of patellar height. It is the ratio of the patella tendon length (LT) to the length of the patella (LP). It can be measured \nfrom a lateral radiograph of the knee. • Ratio between 0.8 and 1.2 - normal • Ratio above 1.2 - high lying patella (patella alta) • Ratio below 0.8 - low lying patella (patella baja) The high and low-lying patella are usually associated with anterior knee pain and recurrent \ndislocations of the patella. The image below is the radiograph of the knee showing the calculation of Insall-Salvati index. 184 \nSold by @itachibot",

      "explanation": "Transverse fractures are the most common types of patellar fractures. Patellar fractures are classified as: • Transverse • Vertical • Polar • Comminuted fractures These fractures may be either undisplaced or displaced. The tendon of the quadriceps muscle is attached to the upper surface of the patella. These \nfractures are usually caused by the excessive pull of the quadriceps muscle, either due to excessive \ncontractions or sudden resisted extension of the knee.",

      "explanation": "The mechanism of injury in the fracture of the lateral condyle of the tibia is a combination of axial \nloading and valgus force. The lateral condyle fractures usually occur when the bumper of a vehicle strikes the pedestrian's \nknee. The weight of the person is the axial force, and the lateral blow by the vehicle is the valgus \nforce acting on the tibial condyle. These forces together lead to the crushing of the lateral tibial \ncondyle by the lateral femoral condyle. 186 \nSold by @itachibot",

The below image shows Pilon fracture. Option A: Tillaux fracture is avulsion fracture of the tibia by the anterior tibiofibular \nligament. common in children, unusual injuries of the growing ankle. Fragment is the lateral part \nof the epiphysis and the injury is therefore a Salter–Harris type 3 fracture.

MTSS is a stress injury of the tibia which occurs due to the frequent overuse of lower limbs. It is \ncommonly seen in athletes and military personnel. 188 \nSold by @itachibot Exercise-induced pain along the distal two-thirds of the medial tibial border is typical. Since it is a \nstress injury, the radiograph of the leg appears normal. Management is mainly conservative with rest and activity modification with less repetitive and \nload-bearing exercises.",

      "explanation": "March fracture/stress fracture is seen most commonly in the neck of the second metatarsal bone. It results from long, repeated stresses like prolonged walking or running, usually seen in military \nmen, athletes, and dancers. They may complain of gradual onset of pain over the 2nd metatarsal \nneck starting 2-4 weeks after the beginning of stressors. On examination, a tender lump may be \nnoted. The x-ray may be normal initially but later show a hairline crack. After a period of 4-6 \nweeks, a mass of callus can be identified. Management: Reduction and splinting are not necessary as it is an undisplaced fracture. Normal \nwalking is permitted while using an elastic bandage on the forefoot. The below image shows a March fracture of the second metatarsal bone. 189 \nSold by @itachibot Note: According to Campbell orthopedics (14th edition) in March fractures, patients often note the \ngradual onset of pain directly over the second metatarsal neck region. In Uptodate, it is \nmentioned that many of the stress fractures occur in the second metatarsal shaft, especially at the \nneck. Hence, neck is considered a more correct answer than shaft.",

It is the angle formed by two lines that are tangents to the highest points of the anterior and \nposterior facets of the calcaneum respectively. This angle is decreased in calcaneal fractures. CT is the investigation of choice for suspected tarsal fractures. Assessment of the bone cortex is \nbest done by CT. Whereas stress fractures or occult fractures are best assessed by MRI. A neutral triangle is an area inside the calcaneum, that contains a relatively less amount of \ntrabecular bone. Hence, it is more prone to calcaneal fractures. 192 \nSold by @itachibot Option B: The critical angle of Gissane is formed by the downward and upward slopes of the \nsuperior surface of the calcaneum. It is increased in intraarticular fracture of the calcaneum. Option C: Kite's angle is the angle between the long axis of the talus and the long axis of the \ncalcaneum.
