There are three types of dislocations of the hip: • Posterior - seen in motor vehicle accidents where the flexed knee of the passenger hits the \ndashboard • Anterior - seen in high energy injuries when the patient falls from the height • Central - seen when there is a blow over the greater trochanter or fall on the side",

      "explanation": "Dashboard injury can lead to: • Posterior hip dislocation • Patellar fracture • Fracture of neck of femur • Acetabular fracture • Shaft of femur fracture 140 \nSold by @itachibot • Posterior cruciate ligament injury Dashboard injury occurs when the knee is flexed and the hip of the driver/passenger thrusts \nforward against the dashboard of the car in road traffic accidents. Posterior dislocation is most \ncommon in this type of injury. Dashboard injury in a flexed knee in neutral adduction causes simple posterior dislocation. \nWhereas, if there is slight abduction, posterior fracture-dislocation occurs.",

The femoral artery pulsation is usually felt against the neck of the femur. Due to the posterior \ndislocation of the hip joint, the femoral vessels fall backwards and the pulsation of the femoral \nartery cannot be felt. This is called as vascular sign of Narath.",

      },
      "correct_answer": "c",
      "explanation": "The radiograph of the patient's pelvis following a road traffic accident reveals upward and lateral \ndislocation of the left femoral head, accompanied by an obscured lesser trochanter, indicating a \nposterior dislocation of the left hip. Posterior hip dislocation is commonly seen following dashboard injuries and the patient presents \nwith flexion, adduction, and internal rotation deformity of the lower limb. Radiological findings: • Loss of continuity of acetabulum with the femoral head (break in Shenton's line) • Upward and lateral displacement of the femoral head • The femoral head appears smaller than normal • The lesser trochanter is not visualized as the thigh is internally rotated • Femoral head and posterior acetabular wall fractures may also be seen The image below shows posterior dislocation with disruption of Shenton's line: 141 \nSold by @itachibot Treatment: An early reduction should be done as the risk of osteonecrosis and subsequent osteoarthritis \nincreases with time. Closed reduction under sedation or general anaesthesia is done in most cases. If there is an \nassociated femoral neck fracture, a closed reduction should not be attempted as it can lead to the \ndisplacement of the femoral neck and disrupt the blood supply to the femoral head. In closed reduction the following steps are done: The pelvis is kept in a steady position and traction is applied in line of the femur with the knee \nflexed at 90 degrees. The hip is then flexed maintaining the traction along with internal rotation \nand adduction. This is called Allis' maneuver. The below image describes this technique: Other methods of closed reduction include - Stimson's maneuver, East Baltimore lift maneuver, \nand Bigelow's maneuver. 142 \nSold by @itachibot After reduction, the stability of the hip is tested by flexing the hip to 90 degrees, and a \nlongitudinal and posteriorly directed force is applied. While performing this the joint is monitored \nin an image intensifier to look for any signs of subluxation. In case of evidence of subluxation or \nany significant fractures then surgical repair should be done. If there is a delay in surgical \ncorrection, skeletal traction with a distal femoral traction pin can be done. If there is damage to the acetabulum, or intervening structures between the femoral head and the \nacetabular surface are present - open reduction can be considered. Early complications: • Sciatic nerve injury - It can be damaged in 10-20% of the cases • Vascular injury - Superior gluteal artery tear can occur • Concurrent femoral shaft fracture - When both occur together hip dislocation may be missed Late complications: • Osteonecrosis of the femoral head • Myositis ossificans • Secondary osteoarthritis • Recurrent instability",

      "explanation": "In posterior dislocation of the hip, the lesser trochanter is not visualized in the radiograph. This is \ndue to the internal rotation of the limb. In posterior dislocation of the hip, there is disruption of Shenton line. It is an imaginary curved \nline drawn along the inferior border of the superior pubic ramus and along the inferomedial \nborder of the neck of femur. This line is continuous and smooth. It is usually disrupted in: • Dislocation of the hip • Fracture neck of femur • Developmental dysplasia of the hip The image given below shows posterior dislocation with disruption of Shenton's line. 143 \nSold by @itachibot",

Allis maneuver- traction applied opposite to the direction of deformity 2. Stimson maneuver- downward pressure to the flexed knee (patient is prone and at the edge of \nthe table) 144 \nSold by @itachibot 3.

This pressure is not felt in the functional cause of limb \nweakness and malingering. In a normal individual, when raising one leg by flexing at the hip, the other limb exerts a \ndownward pressure which can be felt at the ankle. 150 \nSold by @itachibot The McBride's test, Waddell’s test, and O’Donoghue’s test are other examination techniques that \nhelp in distinguishing between organic and non-organic causes of lower back pain. 151 \nSold by @itachibot Fractures of femur",
