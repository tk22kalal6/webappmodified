      "explanation": "Abnormal mobility in a long bone is a pathognomonic sign of fracture. A fracture is a break in the structural continuity of the bone. Generally, movements occur in the \nlimb only at the joints. If one is able to elicit mobility at locations other than the joints (say in the \nmiddle of the arm), it is a definite sign of a fracture. Crepitus may be felt while doing this. Other \nfeatures of a fracture include: • Pain 13 \nSold by @itachibot • Bruising • Swelling • Deformity These can be due to a soft-tissue injury or dislocation as well. Clinically, eliciting abnormal movement or crepitus inflicts more pain. Hence it is no longer \nrecommended.",

Pathological fractures are fractures that occur in a weakened bone that has structurally changed \ndue to some condition. They occur either spontaneously or due to minor trauma. In Gaucher's disease, there is a deficiency of glucocerebrosidase. This leads to an accumulation of \nlipid-laden macrophages in the bone tissue, weakening the bone and causing fractures. Osteogenesis imperfecta is an autosomal dominant disorder that occurs most commonly due to \nmutation in the COL1A and COL2A genes. This results in the abnormal formation of type 1 \ncollagen. Since type 1 collagen is mainly present in the bone, the patient presents with repeated 16 \nSold by @itachibot fractures with no or minimal trauma. Hyperparathyroidism can cause severe bone resorption leading to bone pains and pathological \nfracture. Overall, osteoporosis is the most common reason for pathological fractures.

      "explanation": "The given clinical scenario and the X-ray showing a fracture of the 2nd metatarsal are suggestive \nof a March fracture. It is a type of stress fracture. Stress fractures (or fatigue fractures) occur in a normal bone that is subjected to chronic repetitive \nstress. This initiates a bone remodeling process. When resorption occurs faster than replacement, \nthe bone becomes liable to fracture. Such fractures are typically seen in athletes, dancers, or \nmilitary personnel who have a strenuous exercise regimen. Common sites for stress fractures include: • Metatarsals (especially the second, march fracture) • Calcaneum • Navicular • Distal shaft of the fibula (runner’s fracture) • Tibial shaft • Patella • Femoral neck MRI is the investigation of choice to diagnose stress fractures. It can visualize lower-grade stress \ninjuries before X-ray changes appear. A bone scan is the investigation of choice when multiple \nsites have stress fractures. Most stress fractures are managed using an elastic bandage and avoidance of painful activity until \nthe lesion heals. Stress fracture of the femoral neck should be managed by internal fixation as a \nprophylactic measure. The image below shows a stress fracture: 17 \nSold by @itachibot",

Fracture heals through direct union (primary bone healing) or callus formation (secondary bone \nhealing). • Direct union: This occurs when the fracture site is absolutely stable. This is seen in a fracture \nheld by a metal plate with absolute stability and in cases of impacted fracture in cancellous bones. \nThere is no stimulus for callus formation. Osteoblastic new bone formation occurs directly \nbetween the fracture fragments. • Callus formation: This occurs when the fracture is not fixed rigidly. The healing proceeds \nthrough 5 stages: • Hematoma formation • Inflammation • Soft callus formation • Hard callus formation • Remodeling Healing by callus ensures mechanical strength as the movement and stress make the callus grow \nstronger. 18 \nSold by @itachibot The image below shows callus formation:",

The given X-ray shows a fracture of the radial styloid \nprocess (Chauffeur's fracture or Hutchinson fracture). Reduction of the fracture is done to ensure normal alignment and adequate apposition of the bone \nfragments. There are two methods of reduction: • Closed reduction: The fracture is reduced under appropriate anesthesia and muscle \nrelaxation.

      "explanation": "Open fractures are usually associated with multiple other injuries and compartment syndrome \ncan occur as a complication of open fractures. Open fractures are characterized by a break in the overlying skin and soft tissues. Hence, the \nfracture fragment is exposed to the external environment. It is usually associated with multiple \nother injuries. The most common sites involved in open fractures include • Phalanges (Fingers and toes) • Tibial diaphysis • Distal radius • Ankle Open fractures are more prone to develop an infection, as it's exposed to the external \nenvironment. The presence of an open fracture does not prevent the development of compartment \nsyndrome. Major components of management of all open fractures are: • Antibiotic prophylaxis - It should be given as early as possible • Early debridement of the wound and fracture - This includes the following steps: • Excision of the wound margins • Extension of the wound if required • Delivery of the fracture outside the wound for proper examination • Removal of the devitalized tissue • Cleansing of the wound to remove all the foreign materials • Nerves and tendons are usually left alone, but if the wound is clean, a repair can be considered • Wound cover: 21 \nSold by @itachibot • In Gustilo Type I and II fractures wound cover can be done at the time of debridement (Early \nwound cover) • Delayed wound cover is usually practiced in Type III fractures • Fracture stabilization - The method of stabilization depends on the degree of contamination, \namount of soft tissue damage, and time from the injury to operation. • External fixation is used as a temporary measure if there is a delay in wound cover • If definitive wound cover can be achieved at the time of debridement and there is no significant \ncontamination, then an open fracture can be managed as same as a closed injury",

      "correct_answer": "c",
      "explanation": "The given image shows distraction osteogenesis using the Ilizarov apparatus. Osteomyelitis is not \na contraindication for this procedure. Distraction osteogenesis (distraction histogenesis) is the mechanical induction of new bone that \noccurs between bony surfaces that are gradually pulled apart. This is described as the tension \nstress effect. The most important application of the tension-stress principle is known as callus distraction (or \ncallotaxis). A careful fracture of the bone is performed, followed by a short wait. The young callus \nformed is gradually distracted using a circular or unilateral external fixator. This is used in limb \nlengthening or for the filling of large segmental defects in the bone. Distraction or compression is carried out at the rate of 1 mm per day. This is done in four sittings \n- 0.25 mm, four times a day. It is also used in the following scenarios: • Non-union • Deformity correction 25 \nSold by @itachibot • Osteomyelitis - as it offers the possibility of liberal excision of bone • Arthrodesis - crushing articular surfaces can stimulate union between opposing bones An illustration of distraction osteogenesis using the Ilizarov apparatus and the radiograph depicts \nthe procedure is given below:",

      "explanation": "The autologous bone graft is the gold standard material for filling bone defects. Bone grafts are used to fill the defects in bones caused due to a fracture or malignancy. Bone \ngrafts work by various methods: • Osteoinduction is the recruitment and differentiation of pluripotent mesenchymal stem cells into \nbone-forming osteoprogenitor cells 26 \nSold by @itachibot • Osteoconduction is the creation of the scaffold to support the ingrowth of blood vessels, \nperivascular tissue, and osteoprogenitor cells • Osteogenesis is the process of bone formation after the terminal differentiation of osteogenic \nprogenitor cells into mature osteoblasts",

      "correct_answer": "d",
      "explanation": "The internal fixation of a femur fracture is not an immediate concern in a patient with polytrauma \nand hemodynamic instability secondary to severe blood loss. Instead, splinting is preferred until \nthe patient has been stabilized. Damage Control Orthopaedics (DCO) in unstable/borderline polytrauma patients involves 3 \ncomponents: • Stage 1: Resuscitative procedures for rapid hemorrhage control • Stage 2: Restoration of normal physiologic parameters • Stage 3: Definitive surgical management The first stage is early temporary stabilization of unstable fractures and the control of the \nbleeding. In femur fracture, the most suited approach is temporary stabilization using an external \nfixator. The second stage involves resuscitation and stabilization of the patients in the ICU. Finally, the third stage involves delayed definitive fracture management after the patient’s \ncondition becomes suitable. In femur fracture, the definitive procedure is intramedullary nailing \nwhich is performed after the patient becomes stable. 27 \nSold by @itachibot Complications of fracture",
