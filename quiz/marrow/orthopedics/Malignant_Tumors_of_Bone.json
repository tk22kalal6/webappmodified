A giant cell tumor (option A) is primarily an epiphyseal tumor that usually affects adults between \nages 20 and 40 years when skeletal maturity is complete. Chondroblastoma (option B) is a benign \ntumor of childhood most commonly seen in the epiphysis. Osteoid osteoma (option C) is a benign \ntumor most commonly seen in the diaphysis of the proximal femur. Osteosarcoma is the most common non-hematologic primary malignancy of bone. It occurs most \ncommonly in the second decade of life. It is typically metaphyseal. The distal femur, proximal \ntibia, and proximal humerus are common sites. Morphologically, osteosarcomas are bulky, gritty, gray-white tumors, often with hemorrhage and \ncystic degeneration. They destroy cortices, form soft tissue masses, and spread extensively in the \nmedullary canal, replacing hematopoietic marrow. Although infrequent, they may also penetrate \nthe epiphyseal plate or enter the joint.

      "explanation": "The most probable diagnosis is Ewing's sarcoma. The clinical vignette of a 12-year-old boy presenting with fever, swelling over the right leg, an \nelevated leukocyte count, ESR and CRP, MIC-2 staining being positive and the X-ray \nshowing onion skin appearance are all suggestive of Ewing's sarcoma. It is a highly malignant tumour that frequently affects males between 10 and 20 years of age. It \nusually affects the diaphysis of long bones like the femur and tibia. The femur is the most \ncommonly affected, followed by the tibia, humerus and fibula, but overall the pelvis accounts for \nthe majority of cases. Pain is the earliest symptom, followed by swelling and a low-grade fever. Serologically, the ESR \nand WCC may be elevated and haemoglobin may be reduced. An x-ray shows an aggressive, poorly defined osteolytic lesion with cortical destruction and \nperiosteal reaction. A distinct ‘onion-skin’ appearance is observed due to the destruction of the \ncortex and new bone formation in layers. Histologically, Ewing’s sarcoma is composed of primitive, undifferentiated, small, round blue cells \nwith large nuclei and scant cytoplasm that bears no resemblance to normal tissue. The \ncharacteristic translocation between chromosomes 11 and 22 results in a fusion gene, \nEWSR1-FL11, which is present in 90% of cases. The presence of the translocation may be 495 \nSold by @itachibot supported by means of fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH). Immunohistochemical staining for MIC-2 is specific for Ewing’s sarcoma. The most common sites of metastasis include lungs, bones and lymph nodes. Bone marrow \ninvolvement is a unique feature of Ewing’s sarcoma. Preoperative chemotherapy with vincristine, ifosfamide, doxorubicin and etoposide results in \nextensive tumour necrosis and shrinkage. Wide excision may be combined with adjuvant \nradiotherapy if surgical margins are poor. Definitive radiotherapy rather than surgical excision \nmay be advocated if it is non-resectable or metastasis has occurred. It is a radio-sensitive tumour. Indicators of a favourable prognosis include younger age, involvement of distal appendicular sites, \nsmall tumour volume, normal ESR and greater chemotherapy response.",

      "explanation": "The most likely diagnosis in the given clinical scenario is chordoma. Chordoma is a rare malignant tumor arising from the primitive notochordal remnants. It is \nthe most common primary malignancy of the sacrum. Radiographically, chordomas appear as \ndestructive lesions. Since sacrococcygeal lesions can be obstructed by bowel gas, a lateral X-ray or \nMRI is used in diagnosis. The image given below shows an MRI of a chordoma. 497 \nSold by @itachibot On histopathological examination, a chordoma shows cells containing abundant vacuolated \ncytoplasm known as physaliferous cells. They are arranged in long strands or chords in \na mucinous background as seen in the image below.",

      "explanation": "The genetic abnormality seen in synovial sarcoma is chromosomal translocation t(x;18)(p11;q11). \nThis translocation gives rise to SYT- SSX fusion gene. Synovial sarcoma is a misnomer as the tumour does not arise from the synovium but the \nhistological appearance resembles normal synovial tissue. It is an uncommon malignant \nmesenchymal neoplasm. 498 \nSold by @itachibot Synovial sarcomas are morphologically biphasic i.e. they have nests of epithelioid cells \nsurrounded by malignant spindle cells.",

      "explanation": "The winking owl sign is seen in spinal metastases. It refers to the appearance of the spine when a \npedicle is absent. The usual appearance of the pedicle representing two eyes on the AP projection is lost, as one \npedicle is destroyed. It then appears like one eye is open and the other is winking or \nshut. Potentially, all bony metastasis can do this. However, breast cancer and lung cancer are \ncommonly associated with this condition. The image given below shows an X-ray with winking owl sign.",
