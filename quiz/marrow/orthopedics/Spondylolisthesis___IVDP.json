      "correct_answer": "c",
      "explanation": "The most common site for spondylolisthesis is L5 - S1 (82%), followed by L4 - L5 (11%). Spondylolisthesis is the anterior displacement of one segment of the spine upon another. It is \ncaused as an end result of spondylolysis. Spondylolysis refers to defects or stress fractures in the pars interarticularis of the vertebral arch. \nThe most common site for spondylolysis is L5. The last stage (stage V) of spondylolisthesis is known as spondyloptosis. There is complete \ndisplacement of one vertebra over the next vertebra in this stage. Note: Spondylosis is used to describe degenerative findings in the adjacent vertebral endplates \ndue to age-related skeletal changes or osteophyte formation. Spondylitis is inflammation of the \nvertebrae. 257 \nSold by @itachibot 258 \nSold by @itachibot",

      "explanation": "Type III spondylolisthesis is of degenerative origin and presents mostly during middle-age or \nlater. It occurs most commonly at the L4-L5 level. Wiltse-Newman classification of spondylolisthesis is based on the cause. It is as follows: • I (Dysplastic) - Congenital abnormalities of the lumbosacral junction • II (Isthmic or lytic) - Due to defects in the pars interarticularis • III (Degenerative) - Degenerative changes in the disc and incompetence of facet joints • IV (Traumatic) -Posterior arch fractures causing destabilization of the spine • V (Pathologic) - Due to destructive diseases such as tuberculosis or neoplasm 259 \nSold by @itachibot • VI (Iatrogenic) - After facetectomy surgery and pars fracture during laminectomies Types I and II are commonly seen in childhood and adolescence. These occur most commonly at \nthe L5-S1 level.",

      "explanation": "In the above clinical scenario, the patient most likely has spondylolisthesis. A palpable step in the \nlumbosacral spine is a classic clinical feature of this condition. It is known as step sign. 260 \nSold by @itachibot Normally, the spinous processes of the adjacent vertebrae are aligned with each other. They can \nbe palpated on the back in a smooth way. In spondylolisthesis, one vertebra has moved over the other. Therefore, a step-off or step sign can \nbe felt over the spinous process at the affected level. Note: The step-off sign is also used to describe the radiographic appearance of Lisfranc injury of \nthe foot. There is a dorsal displacement of the tarsal bones with respect to the metatarsal bones.",

The investigation of choice in the case of spondylolysis and spondylolisthesis is an oblique view \nX-ray of the lumbar spine.

Acute disc herniation occurs due to underlying disc degeneration. It is most commonly seen in the \nfourth to fifth decades of life and is more common in men than in women (3:1 ratio). Risk factors include: • Smoking 264 \nSold by @itachibot • Heavy lifting, especially with torsional stress • Strenuous physical activity • Occupational driving Some terms related to disc prolapse are: • Protrusion - posteriorly bulging disc with the outer annulus intact. • Extrusion - expulsion of fibrocartilaginous disc material after rupture occurs through the \nposterior longitudinal ligament. • Sequestration - disc material breaks free to lie in the spinal canal.",

This refers to the patient tilting \nto the unaffected side to relieve the pain of intervertebral disc prolapse (IVDP). Compensatory scoliosis is seen in those with a short leg or a contracture of the hip. It disappears \nwhen the patient is made to sit. Postural scoliosis occurs due to incorrect posture being maintained by the patient. It disappears \nwhen the patient is made to bend forwards. Degenerative scoliosis occurs due to degeneration of the spine with ageing.",

Important tests for intervertebral disc prolapse: 1. Straight Leg Raising Test (SLRT) or Lasegue sign: • Done to assess nerve root irritation in the lumbosacral area. • Patient is made to lie on the back with the head extended, with hips and legs in the neutral \nposition. • Affected leg passively and slowly raised by the ankle with the knee fully extended • SLRT test negative if leg can be raised 80–90 degrees without pain • SLRT test positive if pain elicited between 30-60 or Š0 degrees from horizontal • Pain should be radicular type and radiating to the back of the thigh or to the calf 2. Bragard test (sciatic stretch test or flip test): • Perform SLRT • When the patient experiences discomfort, the leg is lowered a little till the pain disappears • At this angle, the ankle is passively dorsiflexed • If pain is felt again at the back of the thigh or in the calf, the test is positive • Also called reinforcement positive or Bragard’s sign positive 266 \nSold by @itachibot 3. Crossed SLRT (well-leg raising test or Fajersztajn sign): • SLRT is performed on the unaffected side • Pain felt on the affected side • Termed a contralateral positive SLRT or crossed SLRT positive • Very specific sign of root compression • šsually positive when there is severe compression due to a centrally located prolapse 4. Popliteal compression test or Bowstring sign: • Bowstring sign is more specific for disc prolapse than SLRT • Perform SLRT until the patient experiences sciatic pain • Without reducing the amount of lift, bend the knee to relax the sciatic nerve • Buttock pain is immediately relieved • The examiner then presses popliteal fossa to stretch the lateral popliteal nerve behind the lateral \ntibial condyle • Tightening of the nerve like a bowstring re-induces the pain 267 \nSold by @itachibot 5. Femoral stretch (reverse Lasegue test or Mackiewicz sign): • Patient lies prone • Examiner flexes the knee and the hip is passively extended • Test is positive if patient experiences anterior thigh pain • This test is usually positive for L2-L3 and L3-L4 (high lumbar) protrusions",
