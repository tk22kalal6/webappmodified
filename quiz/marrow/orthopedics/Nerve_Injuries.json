      "correct_answer": "d",
      "explanation": "This is a case of saturday night palsy, which is a type of neuropraxia. Neuropraxia is a reversible physiological block in nerve conduction. Saturday night palsy occurs \nwhen radial nerve is compressed in the arm from direct pressure against a firm object. It can \noccur when the person sleeps on the arm, often after alcohol intoxication. Therefore, it is known \nas saturday night palsy or weekend palsy. Other examples for neuropraxia include crutch palsy and tourniquet palsy.",

      "explanation": "Sprouting axons can form an end neuroma in neurotmesis. A neuroma is an overgrowth of fibrous tissue and randomly sprouting axons following nerve \ninjury. A neuroma may form following axonotmesis and neurotmesis. In neurotmesis, neuroma \ndoes not bridge the break in continuity and is called end neuroma. In axonotmesis, the neuroma \nformed bridges the continuity and is called neuroma in continuity. Tinel's sign is used to assess nerve regeneration following injury. The nerve is percussed along its \ncourse to elicit a tingling sensation. The point of tingling marks the site of newly sprouting axons.",

      "correct_answer": "d",
      "explanation": "The image shows atrophy of thenar eminence as seen in carpal tunnel syndrome. It is due to \ncompression of the median nerve where it passes under the flexor retinaculum in the wrist. Patients present with pain and paresthesia over the radial 3 and a half digits. There may be \nweakness of thumb opposition. In chronic cases, the thenar eminence is wasted. Carpal tunnel \nsyndrome can be associated with rheumatoid arthritis, pregnancy, chronic renal failure, \nacromegaly, hypothyroidism, and gout. The diagnosis is usually made on clinical grounds but \nnerve conduction studies can confirm the diagnosis. Tinel's sign is positive in this condition. Sensory symptoms are reproduced by percussing over the \nmedian nerve. Phalen's test is positive where the symptoms are reproduced by holding the wrists in full flexion \nwith the dorsum of the hands pressed together. 439 \nSold by @itachibot Durkan's test is the most specific test for the diagnosis of carpal tunnel syndrome. In Durkan's \ntest, direct median nerve compression elicits paresthesias and pain.",

      "explanation": "The given image shows the pointing index sign and is associated with median nerve injury at the \nforearm or elbow. Median nerve supplies flexor digitorum superficialis and lateral half of flexor digitorum profundus \nmuscles. Hence injury to the median nerve leads to paralysis of these muscles.

The hand \nmust remain flat with palm facing upwards; a pen is held above the palm and the patient is asked \nto touch the pen with his thumb - Positive sign is the inability to touch the pen. Tests used in ulnar nerve injuries include: • Wartenberg's sign - Due to weakness of the palmar interossei muscles and unopposed action of \nthe extensor digiti minimi, there is involuntary abduction of the little finger. • Positive Egawa's test - Due to weakness of dorsal interossei, side to side movements of middle \nfinger is weak. • Positive book test or Froment's sign - Due to weakness of adductor pollicis muscle, adduction of \nthumb is lost. When asked to hold a book, patient tries to hold the book by using flexor pollicis \nlongus muscle. This produces flexion at inter-phalangeal joint while holding the book. 440 \nSold by @itachibot • Card test - Inability to hold a card between the fingers due to loss of adduction by palmar \ninterossei muscles.",

This can occur due to lesions around the shoulder joint, axilla, and crutch palsy. In this \ncase, even the triceps may be paralyzed. Extension of the elbow, wrist, and hand are lost in these \nlesions. • In high lesions like fractures of the humerus and prolonged tourniquet pressure, there is wrist \ndrop, due to weakness of the radial extensors of the wrist, as well \nas inability to extend the metacarpophalangeal joints.
