      "correct_answer": "d",
      "explanation": "The complaints of hip pain in an overweight man with a history of long-term steroid use along \nwith the radiological findings of subchondral cysts and positive crescent sign in the femoral head \nare characteristic of osteonecrosis of the femoral head. Avascular necrosis or osteonecrosis is a painful bone condition that results from diminished blood \nsupply mainly due to trauma or non-traumatic etiologies. Alcohol, corticosteroids, \nimmunosuppressives, and cytotoxic drugs, either singly or in combination, are the most common \ncauses of non-traumatic osteonecrosis. The typical features are pain with movements in or near \nthe joint, click in the joint, joint stiffness, limping gait, and deformity. Restriction of movements is \nalso a feature of this condition. An x-ray shows reactive new bone formation, increased radiolucency in the subchondral bone, \nand a distorted articular surface. The crescent sign is a subchondral fracture overlying the necrotic \nsegment of the femoral head seen on radiography. MRI is the investigation of choice in early \ndisease. It allows the identification of AVN of the femoral head and also determines the exact \nstage and extent of the pathologic process. 203 \nSold by @itachibot Management is based on Ficat and Arlet Classification: Other options: Option A: Tuberculosis of the hip is characterized by painful and restricted movements of the hip, \nespecially at night.

Examination reveals tenderness in the groin along with shortening and external \nrotation of the leg. Xrays show a break in Shenton’s line and trabecular stream, overriding of \ngreater trochanter so that it lies at the level of the head of the femur, and external rotation of the \nfemur is evident by prominent lesser trochanter. Option C: Osteochondromas are common benign bone tumors commonly present in adolescents. \nThe lesions consist of a bony mass, often in the form of a stalk, produced by endochondral \nossification of a growing cartilaginous cap. They are usually painless. The common sites of \ninvolvement are the distal femur, proximal tibia, and proximal humerus. 205 \nSold by @itachibot",

      "explanation": "Haglund deformity, pump bump, or Mulholland deformity is seen around the ankle joint. It refers \nto retrocalcaneal exostosis formed at the posterosuperior aspect of the calcaneum. retrocalcaneal bursa usually protects the Achilles tendon from the calcaneal tuberosity. But in \nHaglund deformity, there is chronic inflammation of this retrocalcaneal bursa due to increased or \nrepetitive chafing between the tuberosity and Achilles tendon. Due to prolonged inflammation, \ndegenerative changes occur and osteophytes form within the tendon leading to calcification at the \nsite of the tendon insertion. This leads to deformity and pain symptoms. Management is usually conservative, using a heel lift, silicone pads in closed shoes, ice \napplication, anti-inflammatory drugs, and stretching exercises of the calf. The image below shows the Haglund deformity. 206 \nSold by @itachibot",

Osteochondritis dissecans develops in the joint when a small, avascular, well-demarcated \nfragment gets separated from the surrounding bone. It most commonly occurs in the knee joint. On examination, the patient feels pain when the knee is medially rotated and then extended. On \nthe contrary, the pain is relieved when the knee is laterally rotated and then extended. This is \nknown as Wilson's sign. In the initial stages, it is treated conservatively. In later stages, it is treated either by removal of \nthe fragment or the cartilage repair techniques like microfracture techniques and autologous \ncartilage implantation.",

      "correct_answer": "c",
      "explanation": "A low Q angle is not a feature of chondromalacia patellae, on the contrary, it has a high Q \nangle (quadriceps angle). Q angle is the angle made by the line of the quadriceps pull with the patellar tendon. The line of \nquadriceps pull extends from the middle of the patella to the anterior superior iliac spine. Normal \nrange is 14-17 degrees. An angle of more than 20 degrees predisposes to anterior knee pain. This condition is commonly seen in young women and athletes and is mainly caused due to the \nmechanical overload of the patellofemoral joint. Patients commonly present with anterior knee pain. The pain is increased by climbing stairs and \nstanding after prolonged sitting. This is known as the theatre sign or movie sign (pain and \nstiffness after sitting for a long time in a theatre). It can also be associated with knee swelling and catching sensation (not true locking) of the knee \njoint. It is treated conservatively by anti-inflammatory medications, avoiding stressful exercises, and \nphysiotherapy. 208 \nSold by @itachibot",
