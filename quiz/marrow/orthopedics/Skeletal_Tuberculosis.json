      "correct_answer": "b",
      "explanation": "Skeletal tuberculosis most commonly affects the dorso-lumbar (thoraco-lumbar) spine in \nadults (thoracic &gt; lumbar). The cervical spine is most commonly affected in children. Skeletal TB affects the axial skeleton more than the appendicular skeleton. Hence, spinal TB is \nmore common as compared to TB of the joints. In the appendicular skeleton, the hip and knee \njoints are more commonly affected.",

      "correct_answer": "c",
      "explanation": "305 \nSold by @itachibot In cases of spinal tuberculosis, the paradiscal area (marked '2' in the image) of the vertebra is \nmost commonly involved. The probable reason for this is the rich blood supply of this area which favors the high oxygen \nrequirement of the tuberculosis bacilli. Appendiceal/ posterior vertebral involvement is the least \ncommonly seen in skeletal TB. The structures marked in the image are as shown below: 1 - Posterior spinal elements 2 - Paradiscal area of the vertebra 3 - Anterior vertebral body 4 - Central vertebral body 306 \nSold by @itachibot",

        "d": "Decreased extension of the vertebral column"
      },
      "correct_answer": "a",
      "explanation": "Spinal tuberculosis leads to loss of lumbar lordosis. Spinal TB more often causes compression fracture of the anterior part of the vertebrae. This leads \nto anterior wedging of the vertebrae giving rise to kyphosis. When spinal TB involves the thoracic vertebrae, it exaggerates the existing thoracic kyphosis. Clinical features of spinal tuberculosis: • Back pain and stiffness are the usual early complaints • Cautious gait - a person with spinal TB will walk carefully with short steps to avoid pain resulting \nfrom movement • Decreased flexion and extension - all the movements of the vertebral column are decreased in \nspinal TB due to the associated paraspinal muscle spasm, pain, and skeletal deformity",

      "correct_answer": "a",
      "explanation": "The reduction of disc space between the vertebrae is an early radiographic finding in spinal \ntuberculosis. This indicates the destruction of the intervertebral disc due to spinal tuberculosis. The infection first involves the vertebral bodies and the intervertebral disc. Hence, the early \nradiographic features include rarefaction/osteopenic appearance of the involved vertebrae and \nreduction of disc space between the vertebrae. 308 \nSold by @itachibot In later stages, the infection leads to para-vertebral abscess formation and vertebral destruction. \nThese features can be seen on a radiograph as bird’s nest abscess and anterior wedging of \nvertebrae respectively. When the disease is in the healing phase, the sclerotic appearance of vertebrae can be seen.",

      "correct_answer": "b",
      "explanation": "The above scenario is suggestive of late-onset paraplegia in spinal tuberculosis. It is because of \nvertebral collapse which causes injury to the spinal cord. Spinal tuberculosis with neurological involvement is known as Pott’s paraplegia. It is classified as \nearly-onset and late-onset paraplegia: • Early-onset paraplegia occurs within 2 years of disease onset. It is due to edema, abscess, or \ngranulation tissue that causes spinal cord compression • Late-onset paraplegia in spinal tuberculosis is because of vertebral collapse which causes injury \nto the spinal cord. Prognosis is better in early-onset paresis because it can subside when the active infection is \ntreated or when the drainage of the abscess relieves compression of the cord.",

It then progresses to spastic paraplegia of the extensors and the flexors. In later stages, it presents \nas an LMN lesion causing flaccid paralysis.",

      "explanation": "Laminectomy is indicated when the posterior parts of the vertebrae are involved. Management of Pott’s paraplegia includes conservative management (with antitubercular therapy) \nor surgery. The \"middle path regimen\" combines both the approaches and includes the following: • Antitubercular therapy • Immobilization using spinal braces • Draining of abscess/surgery if required Surgery is indicated in the following conditions: 309 \nSold by @itachibot • Failed conservative management • Recurrence of the disease after treatment • Rapid onset paraplegia • Bladder and bowel involvement Surgeries for Pott’s paraplegia include: • Antero-lateral decompression - it helps in the removal of both solid and liquid debris and so it's \nthe surgery of choice for Pott’s paraplegia • Costotransversectomy - surgery indicated for paravertebral abscess • Laminectomy - indicated when the posterior parts of vertebrae are involved",

      "correct_answer": "b",
      "explanation": "The above scenario is suggestive of tuberculosis of the hip. An apparent shortening of the limb is \nseen in the stage of early arthritis. Clinical features seen in the four stages of TB hip: • Stage of synovitis presents with apparent lengthening of the limb due to abduction deformity. • Stage of early arthritis presents with apparent shortening of the limb due to adduction \ndeformity. • Stage of advanced arthritis leads to true shortening of the limb because of the destruction of the \narticular cartilage of the femur and the acetabulum. • Stage of arthritis with subluxation leads to true shortening of the limb. The destruction of \nacetabulum leads to dislocation of the femur head. This is also known as wandering acetabulum/ \nmortar and pestle hip because of the widened acetabulum and diminished size of femur head. The TB of the hip finally results in fibrous ankylosis of the hip joint. Note: The apparent length of the lower limb is measured from the umbilicus to the medial \nmalleolus and the true length of the limb is measured from the anterior superior iliac spine to the 310 \nSold by @itachibot medial malleolus. The apparent length is increased when there is abduction deformity of the hip \nand decreased when there is adduction deformity of the hip.",

Early stages of TB hip can be conservatively managed by antitubercular therapy, traction, and \nimmobilization. Later stages need surgical management. Surgeries for TB hip include: • Synovectomy and joint debridement is the preferred surgery in early arthritis. • Girdlestone arthroplasty refers to the modification of the articular surface of the joint. It involves \nexcision of the affected portion of the joint and reconstruction of the joint with vastus lateralis \nmuscle. It gives a painless, mobile joint but it results in an unstable hip. • Arthrodesis refers to the fusion of the joint. It is indicated in painful fibrous ankylosis.

      "explanation": "The above scenario is suggestive of the triple deformity characteristically seen in TB knee. It \noccurs due to the spasm of biceps femoris. Tuberculosis of the knee presents with triple deformity, which includes: • Posterior (and lateral) subluxation - due to ligament laxity/ degeneration • External/lateral rotation - due to spasm of biceps femoris • Flexion - due to spasm of the hamstrings (semimembranosus, semitendinosus, biceps femoris) Sartorius, gracilis, and popliteus are responsible for medial rotation at the knee joint and do not \ncontribute to triple deformity.",
