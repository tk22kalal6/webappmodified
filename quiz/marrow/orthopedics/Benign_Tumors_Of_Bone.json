      "explanation": "A solitary bone cyst (unicameral bone cyst/ simple bone cyst) most commonly occurs in the \nmetaphysis of the bone. Simple bone cyst always occurs during the first two decades of life, most often between 4-10 years \nof age with a 2:1 male preponderance. It is a benign unilocular cyst filled with straw coloured \nserosanguinous fluid. The commonest site is the proximal humerus. They are usually asymptomatic, but pathological \nfractures may occur through the cyst wall and may cause pain and swelling. The cyst may cause \ngrowth disturbances due to its proximity to the growth plate. On X-ray, a bone fracture fragment may be seen resting in a dependent portion of the cyst. This is \nknown as the fallen fragment/fallen leaf sign and it is pathognomonic of a simple bone cyst. The trapdoor sign is a variant of the fallen leaf sign. Here, a periosteal hinge keeps the fragment \nfrom falling dependently and allows it to change position with a change in the patient's position.",

Important X-ray features of a GCT: • A solitary, possibly loculated, lytic lesion in the epiphysis. • Eccentric location, most often subchondral. • Expansion of the overlying cortex. • Soap bubble appearance - The tumor is homogeneously lytic with trabeculae of the remnants of \nbone traversing it, giving it a loculated appearance called soap bubble appearance. • No calcification within the tumor. • No or minimal reactive sclerosis around the tumor. 460 \nSold by @itachibot The image below shows an X-ray of a giant cell tumor showing the typical soap bubble \nappearance: Histologically, GCT is characterized by the presence of a large number of osteoclast-like giant cells \namong scattered round or spindle-shaped mononuclear cells. The tumor stroma is \nwell-vascularized with bands of cellular or collagenous fibrous tissue. The image below shows the histopathology of GCT: Other options: Option A: Aneurysmal bone cyst usually occurs in the metaphysis of long bones and the posterior \nelements of vertebral bodies. It is characterized by multiloculated blood-filled cystic spaces \nseparated by septae, composed of multinucleated osteoclast-like giant cells and reactive woven \nbone. Radiographically, an aneurysmal bone cyst is seen as an eccentric, expansile, lesion with \nwell-defined margins. Most lesions are completely lytic and often contain a thin shell of reactive \nbone at the periphery. 461 \nSold by @itachibot Option C: Chondroblastoma is a benign cartilaginous tumor that occurs mainly in bones around \nthe knee joint. On x-ray, the tumor appears as a well-circumscribed, round, or oval lytic lesion in \nthe center of the epiphysis of long bones, with areas of calcification within the tumor, giving the \ncharacteristic mottled appearance. On histology presence of \"chicken wire calcification\" is \npathognomic. Option D: Langerhans cell histiocytosis commonly involves the skull, pelvis, femur, and mandible. \nRadiographs show a lytic lesion with periosteal new bone formation. In the skull, lesions appear \nas a hole within a hole, and in the vertebra, vertebra plana (flattening of the vertebral body) can be \nseen. Histopathologically, Langerhans cells have a single large nucleus with a characteristic folded \nor grooved nucleus (“coffee-bean” appearance) with small inconspicuous nucleoli. On electron \nmicroscopy, the presence of Birbeck granules in the cytoplasm is characteristic. 462 \nSold by @itachibot",

GCT usually affects young adults of age 20 to 40 years, with slight female predominance. It is a \nbenign but locally aggressive tumor. It is exclusively seen in adults and affects the ends of long \nbones, typically involving the epiphysis. The most common location of the tumor is the distal \nfemur followed by the proximal tibia. Histologically, GCTs show uniform oval mononuclear tumor cells alongside numerous \nosteoclast-type giant cells containing 100 or more nuclei. Necrosis and mitotic activity may be \nprominent. 463 \nSold by @itachibot Other options: Option A: Histologically, osteosarcoma shows pleomorphic tumor cells with hyperchromatic \nnuclei and abundant mitoses. A definitive diagnosis requires the presence of malignant tumor \ncells producing unmineralized osteoid or mineralized bone, which is typically fine and lacelike in \nappearance. Option B: Histologically, Ewing's sarcoma shows sheets of uniform, small, round cells with scant \ncytoplasm, which may appear clear because they are rich in glycogen. The presence of \nHomer–Wright rosettes indicates a greater degree of neuroectodermal differentiation. Option D: Histologically, osteoblastoma shows randomly interconnecting trabeculae of woven \nbone, which are prominently rimmed by a single layer of osteoblasts. The stroma surrounding the \nneoplastic bone is composed of loose connective tissue that contains numerous dilated and \ncongested capillaries. 464 \nSold by @itachibot",

The \ntreatment of choice for this condition is extended curettage and bone grafting. Giant cell tumor is a benign but locally aggressive tumor seen involving the metaphysis and /or \nthe epiphysis of long bones, as seen in the image, in young adults of age 20-45 years and rarely \nteenagers less than 20 years. Although an aneurysmal bone cyst (ABC) is also a benign, locally destructive, \neccentric multiloculated lytic tumor that can present with a similar radiographical picture in any \nage group (most commonly in adolescents), it is confined within the metaphysis of the long \nbones, unlike GCT, thus ruling it out in this case.

The given X-ray shows the presence of a metadiaphyseal cortical lesion involving the upper end of \nthe femur with radiolucent nidus surrounded by cortical sclerosis. The nidus of osteoid osteoma is present in the cortex as can be seen in the image below. Hence, \nCT scan is the best investigation to diagnose osteoid osteoma. Osteoid osteoma is the most common benign bone tumour of the body. It contains osteoblastic as \nwell as osteoclastic components. It is most often seen in young men. The most common site is diaphysis of femur. It typically \npresents with pain that is worse at night and is relieved by aspirin or other nonsteroidal \nantiin■ammatory medications. Multiple treatment options are available for this condition as follows: 470 \nSold by @itachibot • If symptoms are adequately controlled and patient is willing to undergo long-term medical \nmanagement, anti-inflammatory medication can be used as the definitive treatment. Spontaneous \nhealing of the lesion usually occurs within 3 to 4 years. • Patients having lesions of the pelvis or long bones of the extremities can be treated with \npercutaneous radiofrequency ablation. This method is not preferred for vertebral lesions and \nlesions of small bones of hand and feet. • Surgical management involves removal of the entire nidus. This can be accomplished by \ncurettage or en bloc resection. • Magnetic resonance-guided focused ultrasound (MRgFUS) ablation is a new method that is \nunder investigation.",
