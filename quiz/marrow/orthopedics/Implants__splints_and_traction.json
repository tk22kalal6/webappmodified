      "explanation": "The instrument used in the elevation of the periosteum is a periosteal elevator shown in image A. 509 \nSold by @itachibot It is used to elevate the periosteum, as nerves and vessels are generally on this plane, and once \nelevated there is a safer plane for surgery. Option B: The image shows a curette used for curetting a cavity in the bone or removing fibrous \ntissue from the ends of a fracture. It is used in the management of enchondroma, GCT, and \nosteomyelitis. Option C: The image shows an osteotome. It has both sides beveled and is used for cutting bone in \nsurgeries such as McMurray's osteotomy and corrective osteotomy. Option D: It shows a bone gouge, a concave-bladed chisel used for cutting round bone surfaces or \nmaking holes in the bone.",

        "d": "The eye of the nail is useful during its removal"
      },
      "correct_answer": "a",
      "explanation": "The above radiograph shows a K-nail (Kuntscher nail), identified by the absence of interlocking \nscrews. A cloverleaf shape is seen on cross-section. This is designed to give a good rotational \nstability. K-nails have been used for the internal fixation of femur fractures, and fixation relies on the \nfrictional fit between the nail and bone. It is based on the concept of three-point fixation i.e., at \nproximal and distal ends of the bone and at the isthmus (the narrowest part of the medullary \ncavity). The eye at the end of the nail is useful for removing it after the fracture has healed. Some common complications of K-nailing include: • The nail getting stuck • Splintering of the cortex while hammering the nail • Proximal migration of the nail, leading to bursitis over its protruding end • Distal migration of the nail leading to stiffness of the knee 510 \nSold by @itachibot • Infection.",

A malleolar screw is a modified cancellous screw with a sharp-pointed tip. Cortical screws have a smaller thread and low pitch. Compression is produced by over-drilling the \nproximal cortex. 511 \nSold by @itachibot",

        "d": "Nerve palsy is a complication of the procedure"
      },
      "correct_answer": "b",
      "explanation": "The above radiograph depicts the lengthening of the limb using Ilizarov apparatus. The rate of \ncompression/distraction is 1 mm per day, not 2 mm per day. Ilizarov's technique is based on the principle of distraction osteogenesis. This is the mechanical \ninduction of new bone which occurs between bony surfaces that are gradually pulled apart. \nCompression and distraction at the fracture site enhance osteogenesis. A careful fracture of the bone is performed, followed by a short wait. The young callus formed is \ngradually distracted using a circular or unilateral external fixator system called a ring \nfixator. Transfixing thin Kirschner wires (K-wires) are the key components of the Ilizarov fixator \nregarding its axial stiffness. This affects the mechanobiological environment in which the bone \nheals. Distraction or compression can be applied by twisting nuts on the fixation system at the fracture \nor corticotomy site. Distraction or compression is carried out at the rate of 1 mm per day. The uses of Ilizarov's apparatus are as follows: • Limb lengthening • Non-union • Deformity correction • Osteomyelitis - as it offers the possibility of liberal excision of bone • Arthrodesis - crushing articular surfaces can stimulate union between opposing bones Disadvantages of this technique include pin tract infection, nerve palsy, and joint stiffness. The below images show the Ilizarov apparatus and an illustration of distraction osteogenesis. 513 \nSold by @itachibot",

      },
      "correct_answer": "b",
      "explanation": "The above radiograph shows an extramedullary implant called a dynamic hip screw. Intertrochanteric fractures of the femur can be treated by: • Extramedullary implants - dynamic hip screw • Intramedullary implants - proximal femoral nail and gamma nail. Dynamic hip screws are used in undisplaced intertrochanteric fractures, whereas proximal \nfemoral nails are used in displaced intertrochanteric fractures. The below image shows a dynamic hip screw. 514 \nSold by @itachibot Advantages of using a proximal femoral nail over a dynamic hip screw include: • Smaller incisions • Reduced blood loss • Decreased femoral neck shortening • Decreased risk of infection The below image shows a proximal femoral nail with locking and stabilization screws. 515 \nSold by @itachibot Austin Moore's implant is an older implant used in unipolar hemiarthroplasty. It can be identified \nby the fenestrations on the shaft of the prosthesis, as shown below. 516 \nSold by @itachibot Herbert screw is cannulated and threaded at both ends. It is designed for use in fractures of small \narticular bones such as carpals and scaphoid. 517 \nSold by @itachibot",

It is available in various sizes and with different angles of the nose: • Straight nibbler – for general use. • Curved nibbler – for spinal surgery. • Double-action nibbler – straight or curved. The double-action reduces the force required for \ncutting the bone and is mechanically superior.",

Radial nerve palsy manifests as an inability to dorsiflex the wrist and digits (wrist drop and finger \ndrop). Numbness occurs on the dorsoradial aspect of the hand and the dorsal aspect of the radial \n3 1/2 digits. The cock-up splint is designed to counteract the wrist drop position by holding the \nwrist in a slightly extended or neutral position, which helps prevent further contracture and \nallows for functional use of the hand. Other options: Option B: Undisplaced Colles' fracture is managed by immobilization in a below-elbow plaster cast \nfor six weeks. Displaced fractures are managed by manipulative reduction followed by \nimmobilization in Colles' cast in palmar flexion, pronation, and ulnar deviation.
