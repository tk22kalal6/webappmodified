The CASPAR criteria includes: • Evidence of current psoriasis, a personal history of psoriasis, or a family history of psoriasis • Typical psoriatic nail dystrophy observed on the current physical examination • A negative test result for rheumatoid factor • Either current dactylitis or a history of dactylitis • Radiographic evidence of juxta-articular new bone formation in the hand or foot Only current psoriasis is assigned 2 points; all other features are assigned 1 point. To meet the \ncriteria, a patient must have an inflammatory articular disease (joint, spine, or entheseal) with 3 \npoints from the above five categories.

AS is a chronic inflammatory disease affecting the spine and sacroiliac joint. It is more common in \nyoung males and has a strong association with HLA-B27. Features of lower back pain in AS: • Age at onset &lt; 40 years • Insidious onset • Morning stiffness &gt; 30 minutes • Improvement with exercise • Pain persists with rest and is also present at night. 426 \nSold by @itachibot • Alternating gluteal pain • Persistence for more than 3 months Examination findings in AS: • Loss of lumbar lordosis • Increased thoracic kyphosis • Diminished spinal movements • Decreased chest expansion ( &lt;7 cm) • Tenderness over sacroiliac joints Important X-ray features of ankylosing spondylitis: • Sacro-iliac joints: • Cardinal sign/earliest sign is the erosion and fuzziness of the sacroiliac joints • Later- periarticular sclerosis and bony ankylosis of the joint. • Vertebral changes: • Early spondylitis is characterized by small erosions at the corners of vertebral bodies with \nreactive sclerosis: Romanus lesions of the spine (Shiny corner sign) • Squaring of vertebral bodies or flattening of the normal anterior concavity of the spine due to \ninflammatory resorption of the bone. • Later signs are ossification of the ligaments around the intervertebral discs producing \nsyndesmophytes (bridges) between adjacent vertebrae • Bamboo spine appearance is due to bridging at several vertebral levels • Linear ossification along the central spine, representing interspinous ligament ossification can \ngive a Dagger sign appearance on frontal radiographs. CT imaging in AS helps to visualize bone erosions, osteoporosis/osteosclerosis, and new bone \nformation in the form of syndesmophytes, ligamentous ossification, and ankylosis.
