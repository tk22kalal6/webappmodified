It states that, one week of putrefaction in the air is equivalent to two weeks in water, which is \nequivalent to eight weeks buried in soil, given the same environmental temperature.

      },
      "correct_answer": "c",
      "explanation": "Victims of smoke inhalation are affected by carbon monoxide poisoning. In carbon monoxide \npoisoning, the cause of death is anemic hypoxia. 84 \nSold by @itachibot Carbon monoxide has a higher affinity to hemoglobin compared to oxygen and hence the amount \nof hemoglobin available for oxygen transport is markedly reduced. It displaces oxygen from its \ncombination with hemoglobin and forms a relatively stable compound known as \ncarboxyhemoglobin. It thus reduces the oxygen content of the blood, and hence, that of the \ntissues. It acts as a chemical asphyxiant and produces death due to anemic anoxia. It is important to note that in the case of anemic hypoxia, O2 content is low but dissolved O2 is \nwithin normal limits so it does not stimulate peripheral chemoreceptors. Note: Carbon monoxide poisoning causes both anemic (due to CO-Hb) and histotoxic (due to \ninhibition of cytochrome C oxidase) hypoxia. But the main cause of death is due to anemic \nhypoxia. Option A - Histotoxic hypoxia- The most common example is cyanide poisoning. Cyanide inhibits \nimportant enzymes in the oxidative phosphorylation process, which is essential to the survival of \nour cells. Additional oxygen supplementation will not be able to overcome this inhibition, so it will \nhave limited benefit. Hyperbaric oxygen may be helpful to some extent. Option B - Stagnant hypoxia refers to ischemic hypoxia that results from inadequate circulation \ndue to conditions such as heart failure and hypoxia in the setting of shock. In such conditions, \nadministering intravenous fluids can improve the patient's condition because it is the circulation \nthat is affected. If the shock is prolonged it can result in acute respiratory distress syndrome \n(ARDS), which can be treated with positive pressure ventilation and not simply by increasing \noxygen administration.",

It can be visualized by using an ophthalmoscope as \nshown below. 86 \nSold by @itachibot Other postmortem changes occurring in the eye: • Cornea - dull, hazy, opaque, wrinkled • Flaccidity of eyeballs occurs due to falling in intraocular pressure. IOP reaches zero at the end of \n2 hours after death • Tache Noir: A film of cell debris and mucus forms two yellow triangles on the sclera on either \nside of the cornea, with base towards the margin of cornea and apex towards medial or lateral \ncanthus of the eye.

This \ntends to increase the size of the liver and it becomes soft and studded with blisters. As bubbles \ndevelop in the liver, the organ develops a honeycombed vesicular and foamy appearance.",

      "correct_answer": "c",
      "explanation": "Putrefaction is delayed in carbolic acid poisoning. Putrefaction is the fifth stage, following pallor mortis, algor mortis, rigor mortis, and livor mortis \nin the decomposition of dead bodies. It is the decomposition of proteins, the eventual breakdown of the cohesiveness between tissues, \nand the liquefaction of most organs. In the matter of death by poisoning, the putrefaction of the body is chemically delayed by poisons. \nDeath by poisons such as carbon monoxide, potassium cyanide, carbolic acid, barbiturates, \nfluoride, phosphorous, endrin, datura, strychnine, yellow oleander, nicotine, arsenic, mercury, \ncopper, antimony, lead, thallium, chronic alcoholism can resist or delay putrefaction. 93 \nSold by @itachibot Death by septic diseases, puerperal sepsis, kidney diseases with generalized edema can hasten \nputrefaction.

      "explanation": "If a cadaver is recovered in a state of putrefaction and is infested with maggots, the time since \ndeath is likely to be 1 to 2 days. The rationale of forensic entomology is that after death, invasion of an unprotected body by \nsarcosaprophagous (feeding on dead and decay) insects comes in successive waves. Different arthropods colonize the body after death and some species pass through complex life \ncycles. They can be used to determine at least the minimum time since death by studying the \nstage of the life cycle of the insects. Estimated time of death according to fly lifecycle (in summers): • Maggots - 1 to 2 days • Pupae - 3 to 6 days • Adult flies - 6-7 days In winters, the life cycle can be of 8-20 days.",

      "explanation": "When the process involves the face, the features are well preserved, which helps to establish the \nidentity. Adipocere is a modification of putrefaction. In this, the fatty tissues of the body change into a \nsubstance known as adipocere. The change is due to the gradual hydrolysis and hydrogenation of \nfats forming insoluble soaps. These soaps are acidic, which prevents the growth of putrefactive \nbacteria. Adipocere has a distinct offensive or sweetish smell, but during the early stages of its production, \na penetrating ammoniacal odor is also noticed. A warm, moist, anaerobic environment favors \nadipocere formation e.g., bodies immersed in water.",
