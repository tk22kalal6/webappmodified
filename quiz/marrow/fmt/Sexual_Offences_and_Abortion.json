      "options": {
        "a": "1, 2 and 3",
        "b": "2, 3 and 5",
        "c": "1, 2 and 5",
        "d": "2 and 3"
      },
      "correct_answer": "a",
      "explanation": "In the given scenario, you need to start treatment for STI, inform the police, and record refusal of \nconsent for examination. Examination of a sexual assault victim shouldn't be forced upon, but an informed refusal is to be \ndocumented after explaining to them the consequences of choice. Medical treatment and testing for pregnancy have to be done for all victims of sexual assault free \nof cost and police should be informed as per Section 397 of BNSS (357-C of CrPc). As the girl is under 18 years of age, as per POCSO (The Protection of Children from Sexual \nOffences) act 2012, the medical practitioner should initiate treatment for exposure to sexually \ntransmitted diseases (STDs) including prophylaxis for identified STDs (including HIV if \nsuspected) and possible pregnancy and emergency contraceptives should be discussed with the \nvictim and her parent/guardian.",

      "question": "Question 22: A woman gave birth to twins. The father who believed that they did not belong to him \nrequested DNA testing. After testing, it was found that one child did not belong to him. This \ncase would be best described as?",
      "options": {
        "a": "Putrefied fetus",
        "b": "Congenital syphilis",
        "c": "Resorption",
        "d": "Maceration"
      },
      "correct_answer": "b",
      "explanation": "The given clinical scenario where one twin is found to not belong to the father of the other twin is \nsuggestive of heteroparental superfecundation. Superfecundation is the fertilization of 2 different ova in the same menstrual cycle (as suggested \nby the same gestational age) by separate acts of coitus. It can occur even after artificial \nreproductive therapy. Hence, after embryo transfer, intercourse must be avoided. Heteropaternal \nsuperfecundation is used to refer to instances of two different males fathering fraternal twins. \nThis leads to the possibility of twins also being half-siblings. This may give rise to the doubt of \nadultery and infidelity. 238 \nSold by @itachibot Option A: Superfetation is the fertilization of 2 different ova released in different menstrual \ncycles (i.e ovulation and fertilization during pregnancy). This can occur within 12 weeks of \npregnancy after which the decidual space is obliterated and a detailed evaluation will reveal \ndisparities in gestational ages. Option C: Supposititious child is also known as a fictitious child. In such cases, a woman pretends \nto be pregnant and generally substitutes a male child for a female child born of her, or after an \nabortion. This is done for the purpose of claiming property. Option D: Atavism is the reappearance of a characteristic in an individual after several \ngenerations of absence. For example, the child may not resemble his parents but resemble his \nancestors. This is attributed to the recombination of genes. 239 \nSold by @itachibot Childhood Violence, Infanticide and Starvation",
