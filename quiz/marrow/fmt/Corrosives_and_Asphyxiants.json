Agents and procedures contraindicated in caustic ingestions are : • Gastric lavage and administration of activated charcoal • Use of emetics - because vomiting will result in repeat exposure of the airway and GI mucosa to \nthe caustic agent and may precipitate perforation • Neutralization and dilution therapy - There is no proven benefit. Additionally, neutralization of \nthe acid with sodium bicarbonate will lead to the production of carbon dioxide, leading to gastric \ndistension and the risk of perforation. • Nasogastric intubation - This is done blindly and has the potential to exacerbate potential airway \ninjuries. 287 \nSold by @itachibot Note: Oral intubation with direct visualization is the first choice for definitive airway \nmanagement.",

CO binds to hemoglobin with an affinity that is 250 times that of O2 to form carboxyhemoglobin. \nThis means that when the partial pressure of CO is only 1/250 that of O2, equal amounts of CO \nand O2 will bind to hemoglobin.
