      "correct_answer": "b",
      "explanation": "From the given options, mineralization of teeth is the more accurate method of age determination \nin childhood. The relationship between the chronological age and dental age is stronger than between \nchronological age and skeletal age. Two aspects of tooth development have been used in the estimation of dental age: • The emergence of teeth - superior part of the crown of the tooth appearing level with the surface \nof the alveolar bone • The stage of mineralization of crowns and roots during development Estimation of dental age using mineralization stages of crowns and roots of developing teeth \nincludes visualization from a radiographic image. This helps in viewing both erupted and \nunerupted teeth. It is a more accurate method of estimating age than emergence, because \nemergence is an event whose exact time of occurrence is not accurately known. The study of dental microstructure is the most accurate method of age determination in \nchildhood. This involves counting perikymata (incremental lines on the surface of tooth enamel). Note: Eruption is a continuous process by which a tooth moves from its crypt in the jaw bone to \nits position of occlusion in the mouth. It is different from emergence. Emergence denotes that a \ntooth has pierced the gingiva.",

They are totally 32 in number. The tooth distribution in each jaw is as follows: • 4 incisors • 2 canines • 4 premolars 11 \nSold by @itachibot • 6 molars. Thus, each jaw has 16 teeth. Among these 4 incisors and 2 canines and 4 premolars are called as \nsuccessional teeth, which erupt in the place of predecessor deciduous teeth. The remaining 6 permanent molars (1st, 2nd, and 3rd molar teeth) erupt independently without \nany predecessor teeth. Hence they are called superadded teeth.",

      "correct_answer": "c",
      "explanation": "Estimation of age in adulthood (&gt;25 years) is best estimated by degenerative changes in pubic \nsymphysis. Physical anthropology has established several methods for determining age in adults which \ninclude macroscopic, microscopic, and biomolecular methods. Macroscopic methods of adult age determination are the most important ones and consist \nprincipally in the degree of degeneration of selected articulations such as: • Pubic symphysis • Osteochondral surface of the 4th rib 19 \nSold by @itachibot • Auricular surface of the ilium Suchey and Brooks described six phases of degenerative change in the pubic symphysis. Until recently, the most commonly used method for estimating age using the architecture of the \npubic symphysis was that of Todd, who described 10 stages of pubic symphysis change during \naging. More recently, researchers Suchey and Brooks described six phases of degenerative change \nin the pubic symphysis. To solve this controversy, the following is suggested: A two-step procedure has been developed for estimating age: • If by looking at the skeleton, the age of the individual seems to be within the first 3 phases of the \nSuchey–Brookes pubic symphysis method, then this should be the method of choice. • If the subject is classified in the last 3 phases, then one should switch to the Lamendin technique \nin order to assess age more accurately. • Currently, age diagnosis at over 60 remains a problem. In early adulthood, Suchey-Brookes pubic symphysis method is most accurate. In late adulthood, \nLamendin technique of dental age estimation is most accurate.",

      "explanation": "Photosuperimposition is only performed on the skull, not the pelvis. 22 \nSold by @itachibot Photosuperimposition is a well-established technique used for identification. It is done when a \npotential candidate for the identity of a skull is known to the investigating authority and \nphotographs taken during life are available. Photographs of the skull are taken in exactly the same orientation in 3 planes as the available \nphotograph. These are then enlarged to exactly the same dimensions as the photograph, and \neither the negative or a positive print is made on transparent film. This is then laid over the photograph and adjusted in an attempt to match up the major \nanatomical landmarks such as: • Nasion • Supraorbital ridges • Angle of the jaw • Nasal aperture • External auditory meatus • Teeth The test is mainly an exclusory one i.e. if the match cannot be made, then the skull is not that of \nthe person in the photograph. If the match is good or excellent, then it may or may not be the \nsame person. 23 \nSold by @itachibot Race, Sex and Stature Determination",
