      "correct_answer": "a",
      "explanation": "Thallium is considered an ideal homicidal poison because poisoning with thallium resembles \nnatural death. When considering suicide with poison, the suicide victim prefers to terminate life as quickly as \npossible with the least agony. Whereas for an act of homicide with poison, the criminal would like \nto kill his victim without creating any suspicion in the mind of the victim or people around. Following are the characteristics of ideal suicidal and homicidal poisons: Thallium and organic compounds of fluorine satisfy some of the criteria for an ideal homicidal \npoison. Arsenic and aconite are commonly used as homicidal poisons but are not considered ideal \nhomicidal poisons.

      "correct_answer": "d",
      "explanation": "Urinary alkalinization (forced alkaline diuresis) is most effective for weak acids, primarily \neliminated by the renal tract. It is performed with sodium bicarbonate. Acetazolamide should not be used to produce alkaline urine, because it may worsen toxicity by \ncausing a concomitant systemic acidosis. It results in an increase in the amount of the unionized \ndrug in the blood and enhanced tissue distribution. It may also compete with acidic drugs for \ntubular secretion and thereby inhibit their elimination. Drugs most commonly treated with forced alkaline diuresis are salicylates and phenobarbital.",

      },
      "correct_answer": "d",
      "explanation": "Forced acidic diuresis is not indicated in any scenario as its potential risks (such \nas rhabdomyolysis, acute renal injury) outweigh any potential benefits. Note: Though some books say that acidic diuresis is indicated in few poisoning, it is only \ntheoretic. Forced acidic diuresis is never indicated due to the associated risks.",
