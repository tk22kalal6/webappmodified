Body packers are people who swallow a large number of well-sealed packets in order to smuggle \ndrugs across international borders. Body stuffers are patients who swallow cocaine following police pursuit to conceal the evidence. \nThe swallowed packets are often poorly wrapped and can leak or perforate. Both methods can result in severe toxicity and death. Management: • No signs of toxicity - Give single-dose activated charcoal and institute whole-bowel irrigation \nwith polyethylene glycol electrolyte solution to gently hasten packet elimination • Symptomatic patients - Provide sedation and symptomatic care, and obtain immediate surgical \nconsultation for operative removal of the packets • Endoscopy or colonoscopy is not done because the manipulation may rupture the packets. 357 \nSold by @itachibot",
