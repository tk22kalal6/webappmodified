      "explanation": "Cephalic index is used to determine the race of the individual. Formula to calculate cranial index = maximum skull breadth x 100 / maximum skull length The skull offers the best evidence on racial origins. There are three main racial groups, \nnamely, Caucasian, Mongoloid and Negroid. All the skulls cannot be accurately differentiated into the 3 broad categories because of racial \nmixing. The skull of an Indian is caucasian with a few negroid features.

The skull of an Indian is caucasian with a few negroid characteristics. Because of racial mixing, \nthe Indian skull cannot be correctly differentiated into the broad categories of dolichocephalic, \nmesaticephalic, and brachycephalic. Note: This is a controversial question. The use of the cephalic index for the determination of race \nhas been discredited and the cephalic index of the entire Indian population cannot be generalized \nto belong to one category.

Africanoid races tend to have large teeth and often have more cusps on their molars, even up to \neight, with two lingual cusps on the mandibular first premolars as an additional common finding. In Caucasian races, the lateral incisors in the upper jaw are usually smaller than the central. They \nalso have long pointed canine roots. Small nodules on the lingual surface of maxillary molars, \ncalled Carabelli’s cusp are most common in Caucasian races. In mongoloid teeth, enamel pearls and small nodules of enamel on the tooth surface, are much \nmore frequent. The condition of bull-tooth or taurodontism is most common in Mongoloid \npeople. The pulp cavity of molars is wide and deep, and the roots are fused and bent. A congenital \nlack of the third upper molar is most commonly seen. The lingual and labial ridges are more \nprominent.",
