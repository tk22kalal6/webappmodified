      "correct_answer": "b",
      "explanation": "Corpus delicti, also known as the body of offense, says that a crime must be proved to have \noccurred before a person can be convicted of committing that crime. The main part of corpus delicti is the establishment of the identity of the dead body and infliction \nof violence in a particular way, at a particular time and place, by the person or persons charged \nwith a crime and none other. A conviction for an offense does not necessarily depend upon the corpus delicti if there are \neyewitnesses or strong corroborative evidence. In a charge of homicide, it includes: • Positive identification of the dead body (victim) • Proof of its death by a criminal act of the accused 99 \nSold by @itachibot",

      },
      "correct_answer": "a",
      "explanation": "In the case of a medicolegal autopsy, consent of the relatives is not required. For conducting a medicolegal autopsy: • Legal authorization is a must • Magistrate is the authorizing officer in case of exhumation • Preferably, a forensic pathologist or medicolegal expert does the autopsy. However, in India, due \nto the lack of adequate qualified experts, all registered medical practitioners can perform this with \nauthorization by the state. Note: Clinical/ pathological autopsy requires consent from the relatives of the deceased.",

      "explanation": "In deaths due to RTA, autopsy is usually performed in an equipped mortuary. An autopsy may be \nperformed at the site of recovery of the body, in the following scenarios: • Advanced stage of putrefaction as materials of evidentiary value may be lost during \ntransportation • Exhumation • If the District Magistrate desires it to be conducted at the site due to some law and order \nproblems An autopsy is preferably performed in an equipped mortuary.",

      "question": "Question 4: The police hands over the body of a person who died due to hanging to you for an autopsy. \nWhich of the following incisions is preferred in this case?",
      "options": {
        "a": "I shaped incision",

        "c": "Y shaped incision",
        "d": "Inverted Y shaped incision"
      },
      "correct_answer": "b",
      "explanation": "The incision preferred in the case of asphyxial death due to neck compression (as in hanging) is \nthe modified Y-shaped incision. In strangulation, hanging, and any condition where the larynx might be damaged, a modified \nY-shaped incision is to be preferred. This incision is used because the skin of the upper neck can \nthen be dissected off the mandible and raised to give a wide approach to the neck structures. Given below are types of incisions done for an autopsy: 1. Y-Shaped Incision: Commences at the acromial process on the shoulder on either side. It runs \ndownwards and anteriorly beneath the breasts as to meet at the xiphisternum in the midline. It \nthen runs downwards as in an I-shaped incision to the symphysis pubis. It is preferred in females. \nIt is more cosmetically accepted as the incision and the stitches are minimally seen after the \nautopsy. 100 \nSold by @itachibot 2. Modified Y-shaped incision: Commences at the angle of mandible on either side, brought \nforwards and downwards to meet at the suprasternal notch. It is then run downwards as a midline \nincision up to the pubic symphysis. Indicated in cases of strangulation or death due to \ncompression of the neck. 3. I-Shaped Incision: Extends from symphysis mentii to symphysis pubis taking curve towards left \naround the umbilicus. It is used routinely in practice. It is simple and convenient. 101 \nSold by @itachibot 4. Elongated X-shaped Incision: This is a special incision used to dissect out subcutaneous \nstructures in the back to identify and evaluate the extent of blunt injuries, which are usually \nmissed where superficial imprints are faint, particularly when present on skin not overlying bone. \nThis is helpful in the reconstruction of events prior to death and should be practiced in cases of \ncustodial death. 5. Inverted Y-shaped incision is used in infants.",

        "c": "Liver",

      "correct_answer": "b",
      "explanation": "In Breslau’s second life test, also known as the stomach bowel test, the stomach and the \nduodenum are tested. This test is done to determine whether the baby was born alive or not. It works on the principle that some air is swallowed during respiration in a live-born child. \nDetecting the presence of this air in these viscera constitutes the basis for this test. Procedure : The stomach and duodenum are removed separately and placed in water. If they float, make a \nsmall cut while underwater to see air bubbles coming up. A floating viscera giving out air bubbles \nwhen opened underwater is a positive test. Interpretation: • A positive test proves live birth even in the absence of a positive hydrostatic lung test. This may \nhappen if there had been some obstruction in the respiratory passages. • A negative test does not mean stillbirth since air does not necessarily enter the stomach in \nadequate amounts during the breathing act. 103 \nSold by @itachibot • Putrefaction invalidates the result. Note: Breslau’s first life test is when the same test is performed on the lungs. Also known as \nHydrostatic test/ Floatation test / Raygat’s test.",

      "correct_answer": "c",
      "explanation": "In Raygat's test, an unrespired lung (stillbirth) may float due to gases of decomposition, as seen in \nputrefaction. It is also known as the floatation test/ Breslau’s first life test/ hydrostatic test. It is done to \ndetermine whether the newborn has respired or not: • If the lung pieces float in water, it means that respiration has taken place, indicating a live birth • If the pieces sink, respiration has not taken place, signifies stillborn A respired lung (live birth) may sink in water in the following conditions: • Lung edema • Lung collapse • Pneumonia (consolidation) • Congenital syphilis Other tests to determine if respiration has taken place or not are: • Fodere’s test: Weight of lungs before respiration - 30-40g, after respiration - 60-66g • Ploucquet’s test: Weight of lungs before respiration - 1/70 of body weight, after respiration - 1/35 \nof body weight • Wredin’s test: Assesses the changes in the middle ear. The gelatinous substance in the middle \near is replaced by air if respiration has taken place.",

The magistrate/commissioner of the police vested with such power, orders the second autopsy. A second autopsy may be performed in the following cases: • The relatives of the deceased are not satisfied with the first autopsy report and they have pointed \nout certain lapses in the first autopsy. • The first autopsy was not performed in the light of the circumstances which are now available. • The investigating authority demands a second autopsy for setting the investigation on the right \ntrack.",
