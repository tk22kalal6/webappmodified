      },
      "correct_answer": "a",
      "explanation": "Arsenic can be found even in skeletonized remains of the body. It delays putrefaction and can be \nfound in bones, hair, and nails for several years. It becomes fixed in the cancellous tissues of the long bones by \nthe conversion of phosphates to arsenates. The elimination of arsenic in this form is much slower \nand can be detected in the bones for several years after death. Heavy metals such as lead, copper, mercury, including metalloids like arsenic and antimony, may \nbe found in bones for a prolonged period in cases of chronic poisoning. They are also deposited in \nhair, nails, etc. For these reasons, when heavy metal poisoning is suspected, these specimens are \ncollected in addition to the routine viscera and body fluids.",

      "correct_answer": "b",
      "explanation": "Arsine gas is the most toxic form of arsenic (acute exposure). The toxicity of arsenic compounds can vary greatly. In general, arsenic compounds can be ranked \nfrom highest to lowest toxicity: • Inorganic trivalent (+3) compounds • Organic trivalent (+3) compounds • Inorganic pentavalent (+5) compounds • Organic pentavalent (+5) compounds • Elemental arsenic Inorganic arsenic is generally more toxic than organic arsenic. Forms of arsenic that are more \nrapidly absorbed are more toxic, while those most rapidly eliminated tend to be less toxic. \nArsenite and arsenate forms are highly soluble in water.",

      "correct_answer": "a",
      "explanation": "The given image (acrodynia) and the clinical features point towards a diagnosis of chronic organic \nmercury poisoning (methyl mercury). Mercury acts as a poison by binding to sulfhydryl groups on \nenzymes. Mechanisms of toxicity of mercury: • High-affinity binding of divalent mercury to sulfhydryl groups of proteins in the cells is an \nimportant mechanism for producing nonspecific cell injury or even cell death. • Both inorganic and methylmercury damage mitochondria and disrupt intracellular calcium \nhomeostasis • Methylmercury also affects the MAPK signaling pathway • Methylmercury has also been shown to disrupt microtubules in neurites Orofacial paresthesias is the initial common symptom of chronic mercury poisoning followed by \nheadache, tremor, and fatigue. Other features include mild GI, renal, and pulmonary \nabnormalities. In severe cases, the following features are seen: • Ataxia • Muscle rigidity and spasticity • Blindness • Hearing deficits • Dementia (neurotoxicity)",

      "explanation": "Excess of selenium causes alkali disease in livestock. Clinical types of selenium intoxication: • Acute selenosis • Subacute selenosis (i.e., blind staggers type) • Chronic selenosis (i.e., alkali disease type) Alkali disease occurs when animals consume moderate levels of selenium for a period of weeks to \nmonths. The usual clinical signs of chronic selenosis in horses, cattle, and swine are loss of hair (horses \nand cattle lose long hair from the mane and tails), emaciation, hoof lesions, weight reduction, and \nlameness.",

      "correct_answer": "c",
      "explanation": "The correct order of symptomatology in iron toxicity is 3 -&gt; 2 -&gt; 4 -&gt;1. Symptoms of iron toxicity are divided into 4 stages: • Stage 1 (few hours after ingestion): vomiting, abdominal pain, gastrointestinal bleeding, shock, \nacidosis, and coma • Stage 2 (6-24 hours): Asymptomatic phase • Stage 3 (24-48 hours): Metabolic acidosis, jaundice, hypoglycemia, shock, coma with hepatic and \nrenal failure. • Stage 4 (1-2 weeks): Late complications such as gastric stricture and pyloric stenosis. Iron exerts its toxic effects by increasing capillary permeability, release of hydrogen ions, \ninhibition of mitochondrial function, and direct corrosive action on the gastric mucosa. Ingestion \nof 20 to 30 grams is considered to be fatal and the fatal period is around 24-30 hours. \nDesferrioxamine is the mainstay of treatment with supportive gastric lavage, administration of egg \nand milk to form iron-protein complexes, oral MgOH solution, and hemodialysis in severe cases. Postmortem changes in iron toxicity include: • Hemorrhagic necrosis of gastric mucosa with perforation of gastric or jejunal wall • Acute hepatic necrosis • Degenerative renal tubular changes 324 \nSold by @itachibot Organic Irritants - Plant and Animal Poisons",
