A contusion is an effusion of blood into the tissues, due to the rupture of blood vessels caused by \nblunt trauma. A contusion evolves to form an intracerebral hematoma over hours or days. 134 \nSold by @itachibot The most common type of intracranial hemorrhage following trauma is a subarachnoid \nhemorrhage.

      },
      "correct_answer": "c",
      "explanation": "At the point of contact of the weapon (hammer) with the skull, the inner table is likely to fracture. When the skull receives a focal impact there is a momentary distortion of the shape of the \ncranium. The area under the point of impact bends inwards. As the contents of the skull are \nvirtually incompressible, there must consequently be a compensatory distortion or bulging of \nother areas. This is the struck hoop analogy. Both these intruded and extruded areas can be the site of fracturing if the distortion of the bone \nexceeds the limits of its elasticity. The inner table will fracture where the skull is indented and the \nouter table will fracture at the margins of the deformed area. The following images show the mechanism of skull fracture. Option A: Trauma most commonly causes subarachnoid hemorrhage, not subdural hemorrhage. Option B: Fractures lines of the skull do not cross each other. This forms the basis for Puppe's \nrule.

Patients with EDH present with 3 phases: 137 \nSold by @itachibot • The patient is initially unconscious from the concussive aspect of the head trauma. • The patient then awakens and has a lucid interval while the hematoma sub-clinically expands. • As the volume of the hematoma grows, intracranial pressure (ICP) increases, and the patient \nrapidly becomes lethargic and unconscious.

      "explanation": "Extradural hemorrhages (EDH) cannot be ruled out in the absence of a skull fracture. Most EDH are associated with skull fractures. They usually occur unilaterally in the \nparieto-temporal area, caused by the rupture of the middle meningeal artery (usually posterior \nbranch). However, they can occur rarely in the absence of any skull fractures or external injuries. It is the least common type of brain membrane bleeding. A minimum volume of 35 ml is needed \nbefore clinical signs are apparent.

This occurs when the \nhead has been exposed to severe external heat sufficient to burn the scalp and skull. The blood \nmay be extruded from the diploë and venous sinuses into the extradural space to produce a heat \nhematoma. This false hematoma is brown and friable, and the adjacent brain tissue shows \nhardening and discoloration from the heat. There is often a significant level of carboxyhemoglobin in the body if the death occurred when the \nfire was in progress. This should be of the same concentration in the heat hematoma as in the \nperipheral blood. If the victim suffered a head injury before the fire started (indicating an \nextradural hemorrhage), then there should be little or no carboxyhemoglobin in the hematoma.",

      "explanation": "A fall on the frontal region will not produce occipital contrecoup injuries. This is due to the \nrelatively smooth internal surface of the posterior cranial fossa. Coup injury is damage that occurs on the same side of the direct trauma. Contrecoup injuries are \npresent opposite to the site of trauma and is due to shear strain. Fracture of the skull may not occur, even in the presence of severe coup and contrecoup injuries \n(option A). The skull's anterior and middle cranial fossae have sharp edges. This makes the \ntemporal and frontal lobes highly prone to contrecoup injuries (option D). A fall on the temporal region can produce a contrecoup injury on the ipsilateral lobe due to the \npresence of the falx cerebri (option C). During the impact, the ipsilateral lobe moves in the opposite direction striking the falx cerebri, \nresulting in contrecoup injury on the same lobe (as the impact) but opposite to the site of initial \ntrauma. 140 \nSold by @itachibot",
