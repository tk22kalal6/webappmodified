      },
      "correct_answer": "b",
      "explanation": "Edmond Locard is famous for his theory of exchange or Locard’s exchange principle. This theory states that every contact leaves a trace. When two objects come into contact with one \nanother, each will take something from the other object or leave something behind. Locard is also renowned for his contribution to the improvement of dactylography, an area of \nstudy that deals with fingerprints. He developed the science of poroscopy, the study of fingerprint \npores, and the impressions produced by these pores.",

      },
      "correct_answer": "b",
      "explanation": "Fingerprint patterns are determined by the 4th month of gestation and remain fixed throughout \nlife. Fingerprints are impressions of patterns that are formed by papillary or epidermal ridges at the \nfingertips. They begin to appear between 12-16 weeks of intrauterine life. The formation is \ncompleted by 24 weeks. At birth, a fine pattern of ridges is seen on the skin of the bulbs of the \nfingers and thumbs, parts of the palms, and the soles of the feet.",

      },
      "correct_answer": "c",
      "explanation": "Plain arches have no delta. Classification of fingerprints into different patterns is based on delta and core formation. Delta is \na triangular arrangement formed where three separate ridge line flows come together. Core is the \ncentermost portion of a ridge flow pattern. The number of delta and core for each pattern is given below. The image given below shows the delta and core in the different fingerprint patterns. For each \ntype, the position of the core is marked with a green circle, and the delta is marked with a blue \ntriangle.

      },
      "correct_answer": "d",
      "explanation": "Latent prints can be made visible by ultraviolet spectrum lighting, application of lead powder \nand cyanoacrylate fuming. Latent prints are those that are left behind through interaction of hands, palms, and feet with the \nenvironment. Occasionally these prints are left cleanly so as to be clearly visible to the unaided \neye. It is more often the case that the prints are only partially visible or not visible at all without \nthe use of specialized fingerprint-processing methods and equipment. Methods to enhance fingerprints: • Lighting or photoluminescence • White light • Ultraviolet spectrum • Physical method - dusting a surface with a fine powder of contrasting color such as: • White: Lead carbonate • Black: Charcoal • Grey: Aluminium dust or chalk powder + mercury • Chemical • Ninhydrin • Cyanoacrylate fuming • Silver nitrate 49 \nSold by @itachibot",

      "correct_answer": "c",
      "explanation": "Histological sections up to a depth of 0.6mm from the surface of the skin give satisfactory \nfingerprints. Since the ridges extend up to the dermis, fingerprints can be obtained from the \ndermis as well.",

      "correct_answer": "c",
      "explanation": "Fingerprint pattern differs in identical twins. Fingerprints are formed during intrauterine life due to friction ridges. These ridges are created by \npressure on the fingers from touching the surroundings. Hence, it is unique to every individual.",

      "correct_answer": "d",
      "explanation": "A person suffering from dermatopathia pigmentosa reticularis (DPR) has a lack of fingerprint \npatterns, and hence will not leave fingerprint marks. There are two closely related autosomal dominant ectodermal dysplasia syndromes causing \ncomplete absence of fingerprints. They are Naegeli–Franceschetti–Jadassohn syndrome (NFJS) \nand dermatopathia pigmentosa reticularis (DPR). A permanent damage of fingerprints also occurs in patients with leprosy, electrical injury, and \nirradiation.",

      "correct_answer": "a",
      "explanation": "Edgeoscopy is a method of identification through the examination of the unique details and \ncharacteristics found along the edges of individual fingerprint ridges. Methods of identification using different prints: • Dactylography - evaluation of finger prints • Poroscopy - evaluation of sweat pore openings on fingerprint ridges • Cheiloscopy - evaluation of lip prints • Podography - evaluation of foot prints • Rugoscopy - evaluation of palatal rugae • Ridgeology - evaluation of friction ridges on fingerprints Note: Locard is known as the father of poroscopy, edgeoscopy and ridgeology. 50 \nSold by @itachibot",

      "explanation": "Methods for deliberate tattoo removal include: • Surgical excision • Scarification with sandpaper • Application of caustic soda • Electrolysis • Q-switch laser method - non-invasive and effective method for removing tattoos without scarring All other methods depend upon damage to the epidermis and dermis, with consequent \ninflammation and scar formation. The tattoo is removed but replaced with a cicatrix, which will \nitself indicate that something pre-existed at that site. Attempts at the deliberate removal of tattoos are common to remove evidence of identity. Note: If the tattoo mark is absolutely invisible or has been removed artificially, the pigments used \nto produce them may be detected by histological examination of the lymph node.",

      },
      "correct_answer": "c",
      "explanation": "Black areas in a tattoo are the least likely to fade over years. This is because the black pigment (carbon particles) are more resistant than the other pigments to \ntransportation by the lymphatic system. Thus, they tend to persist in the skin. Colors such as blue, green, or red are scavenged by tissue cells and leached into the lymphatic \nsystem after a number of years or decades. Light colors such as white, pink, and blue fade faster. Chemicals used in different tattoo pigments are: • Black pigment - Carbon • Green pigment - Potassium dichromate • Red pigment - Mercuric chloride If the tattoo mark is absolutely invisible or has been removed artificially, the pigments used to \nproduce them may be detected by histological examination of the lymph node.",
