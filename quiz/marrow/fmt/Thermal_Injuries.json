      "correct_answer": "d",
      "explanation": "Once the body temperature has fallen below about 85°F (30°C), the ability of the hypothalamus to \nregulate temperature is lost. For each 10°F decrease in body temperature, the rate of chemical heat production in each cell is \ndepressed almost twofold. This is the reason for diminished temperature regulation. Sleepiness \nfollowed by coma, depresses the activity of the CNS heat control mechanisms and prevents \nshivering.",

      "explanation": "The given phenomenon of paradoxical undressing is likely due to peripheral vasodilation. It is a phenomenon encountered in severe hypothermic states. It is characterized by the act of \nactive undressing, despite low ambient temperatures. Proposed mechanisms are: • Reflex vasoconstriction, which happens in the first stage of hypothermia, leads to paralysis of the \nvasomotor center thus giving rise to the sensation that the body temperature is higher than it \nreally is. • Vasodilatation happens when cold-induced paralysis of the nerves in the vessel walls gives an \nabsurd feeling of heat.

Methods of estimation of burn surface area: Rule of nines (Wallace) - It divides the body into segments that are approximately 9% or multiples \nof 9%, with the perineum forming the remaining 1%. Because of the proportionately larger heads \nand smaller legs of infants and children, this method must be modified in pediatric burn injuries.

The false \nsplit will show no bleeding in the deeper tissues and its position is usually suggestive. • Heat hematoma - the mass of blood resembling a true extradural hematoma may form between \nthe skull and the dura. This may arise either from venous sinuses or out of the diploic space in the \nskull through emissary venous channels. If death occured during the fire (antemortem), levels of carboxyhemoglobin will be elevated in the \nblood and the heat hematoma.
