      "correct_answer": "c",
      "explanation": "Hydrocution is the term used for cold water drowning. Hydrocution/ immersion syndrome refers to sudden death following immersion in cold water. \nDeath results from vagal inhibition of the heart i.e. cardiac arrest occurring due to increased \nstimulation of the vagus nerve. Vagus stimulation occurs due to the following mechanisms: • Sudden entry of water into the nasopharynx or larynx • Falling or diving into the water in a manner so that it suddenly strikes the abdomen, especially \nthe epigastric region • Sudden in-rush of cold water into the ears The types of drowning are: • Wet drowning/ typical drowning • Atypical drowning/ dry drowning • Immersion syndrome/ hydrocution • Post-immersion syndrome/ secondary/ near-drowning • Submersion of the unconscious/ shallow-water drowning 218 \nSold by @itachibot",

      "question": "Question 2: A 30-year-old fisherman was brought dead. His autopsy findings revealed emphysema \naquosum. What is the most probable cause of death?",
      "options": {
        "a": "Wet drowning",
        "b": "Shallow-water drowning",
        "c": "Immersion syndrome",
        "d": "Secondary drowning"
      },
      "correct_answer": "a",
      "explanation": "Emphysema aquosum is seen in cases of wet drowning. Overinflation of the lungs in drowning is known as emphysema aquosum. It is one of the most \nvaluable positive signs of drowning. The oedema fluid in the bronchi blocks the passive collapse that normally occurs at death. Hence, \nthe lungs are held in the inspiratory position. The impression of the ribs on this overinflated lung \nleaves visible and palpable grooves on the lateral surface. Autopsy findings in drowning: • Froth in the air passages - most useful autopsy sign in drowning. It consists of a proteinaceous \nexudate and surfactant mixed with the water of the drowning medium. • Waterlogging of the lung - frothy fluid will exude from the bronchi when the lung is squeezed \nand from the cut surfaces when they are sectioned with a knife. But, the absence of waterlogging \nby no means excludes true drowning (e.g. dry drowning). • Emphysema aquosum - overinflation of the lungs • Paltauf’s spots - subpleural haemorrhages that reflect haemolysis within intra-alveolar \nhaemorrhages • Dilation of the right heart and great veins - subjective and non-specific finding • Foreign material in the stomach - watery fluid or even foreign material from the water, such as \nsilt, weed or sand • Hemorrhage into the middle ears and into the temporal bone - a positive non-specific sign of \ndrowning • Presence of fluid in the middle ear or paranasal sinuses - not a reliable diagnostic sign of \ndrowning Note: The autopsy findings in drowning are mostly nonspecific and none give conclusive evidence \nof drowning. The most useful one is froth in the air passages.",

      },
      "correct_answer": "c",
      "explanation": "Attachment of weights to the body to keep it underwater is consistent with both homicidal and \nsuicidal drowning. Differentiating points: • Suicidal drowning - determined suicidal person may attach weights to the body or tie his limbs. \nIt is common among women. • Homicidal drowning - the following additional features may point to a homicidal drowning: • Constriction/marks around the neck may be present • Evidence of struggle at the banks of the river from where the body was recovered • Articles belonging to someone other than the deceased found on the banks of the river associated \nwith those belonging to the deceased 219 \nSold by @itachibot Accidental drowning is the most common form of drowning. It is seen among fishermen, bathers, \ndock workers, intoxicated, and epileptics. Homicidal drowning is the least common.",

        "c": "Vasovagal inhibition",
        "d": "Laryngeal spasm"
      },
      "correct_answer": "c",
      "explanation": "The given clinical scenario is suggestive of immersion syndrome/ hydrocution/ submersion \ninhibition. Death results from cardiac arrest due to vasovagal inhibition followed by cardiac \narrest. Vagal stimulation occurs due to: • Stimulation of nerve endings of the surface of the body by cold water • Falling or diving into the water in a manner so that it suddenly strikes the abdomen, especially \nthe epigastric region. • Stimulation of the nerve endings of the mucosa by the entry of cold water into the eardrums, \nnasal passages, the pharynx, and the larynx. The mechanism involved in immersion syndrome: • Diving/falling into the water, feet-first • Inexperienced \"duck-diving\" • Diving/falling into the water with a horizontal entry People under the influence of alcohol are more likely affected due to the general vasodilation of \nskin vessels, consequently amplifying the effects of vasovagal inhibition. These effects are \nincreased in people who are attempting suicide/anxious as they have a more active reflex arc. Option A: Cerebral edema is seen in cases of near-drowning. It is a type of atypical drowning and \nis also known as post-immersion syndrome or secondary drowning. This type is necessitated by \nthe survival of the drowning victim beyond 24 hours of a submersion episode. Death is due to \nrespiratory decompensation suffered despite responding well to initial resuscitation measures. \nMechanisms of death involve hypoxemia which results in sepsis, electrolyte imbalances, \npulmonary edema, and cerebral edema. Option B: Pulmonary edema and cardiac arrest are the cause of death in typical drowning/primary \ndrowning due to inhalation of water into the lungs. There are varying mechanisms for freshwater 220 \nSold by @itachibot and saltwater drowning leading to either ventricular fibrillation or cardiac arrest respectively. \nBoth types of typical drowning have terminal pulmonary edema and heart failure as mechanisms \nof death. Option D: In dry drowning death is due to the development of laryngeal spasm and subsequent \nairway closure. Thick mucus, foam, and froth may develop, producing a plug.",

      },
      "correct_answer": "c",
      "explanation": "Freshwater drowning (drowning in a lake) is associated with both hyponatremia \nand hyperkalemia. When freshwater (hypotonic to plasma) enters the alveolar spaces, it is rapidly absorbed into the \npulmonary circulation resulting in gross local hemodilution. This massive increase in blood \nvolume leads to hemolysis with the liberation of potassium. This causes hyperkalemia with \ncorresponding hyponatremia. When seawater enters, due to high saline content, reverse osmotic flow occurs. The fluid leaves \nthe circulation and enters the alveolar spaces. This causes hemoconcentration, hypernatremia and \npulmonary edema.",

      "explanation": "Gettler's test measures the chloride content of left and right side of the heart. A difference of 25 mg% in chloride concentrations between the two sides of the heart is an \nindication of death due to drowning. This test was used to identify the cause of drowning. • Freshwater drowning - chloride content of left heart is lower than that of the right heart • Saltwater drowning - chloride content of right heart is lower than that of the left heart Gettler's claims have been refuted and the test is no longer accepted.",

        "d": "It is also known as cutis anserina"
      },
      "correct_answer": "b",
      "explanation": "The image given shows the skin maceration or washerwoman's skin. It occurs faster in warm \nwater than in cold water. The signs of immersion are: 1. Maceration of skin/ washerwoman's skin - It begins within minutes in warm water and takes \nlonger in cold water. It refers to the wrinkled, pale, and soaked appearance of the skin when \nimmersed in water. This first appears on areas with an appreciable keratin layer such as the \nfingertips palms, backs of the hands, and later the soles. The first site affected is the fingerpads. It \naffects the hands earlier than the feet. The image given below shows skin maceration. 221 \nSold by @itachibot 2. Cutis anserina - 'goose-flesh' or piloerection: This is usually found in cold water. The image given below shows cutis anserina. 3. Post-mortem hypostasis - If the water is still, the postmortem hypostasis affects the heads and \nthe limbs. This is because the chest and abdomen float higher because of the lungs and the \nabdominal gases. 4. Foreign bodies in respiratory passages and stomach - Sand may be found deep in the \nrespiratory passages and stomach, especially if the body has been rolled by the waves on a beach. \nThis is not evidence of live aspiration. The signs of immersion just indicate that the body was immersed in water. They are not evidence \nof death from drowning. In temperate climates, the following is an approximate guide to estimate the duration of \nimmersion: 222 \nSold by @itachibot Finding \nTime since immersio \nn No wrinkling of finger pads \nLess than a few hour \ns Few hours to 3 days Wrinkled fingers, palms, and feet 4-10 days Early decomposition (Head a \nnd abdomen) 2-4 weeks Marbling of veins, peeling of \nthe epidermis 1-2 months Muscle loss with bone exposu \nre",
