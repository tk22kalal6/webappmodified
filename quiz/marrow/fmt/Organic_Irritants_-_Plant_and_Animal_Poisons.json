      "correct_answer": "d",
      "explanation": "Death from poison hemlock (Conium maculatum) occurs due to the overstimulation of nicotinic \nreceptors. 336 \nSold by @itachibot All parts of poison hemlock contain coniine and similar alkaloids that are structurally and \nfunctionally analogous to nicotine. The mechanism of poisoning is two-fold: • Non depolarising muscle blockade at the neuromuscular junction leading to flaccid paralysis and \nrespiratory paralysis. • Initial overstimulation followed by rapid depression by the nicotinic receptors. These cause symptoms such as salivation, mydriasis, initial tachycardia followed by bradycardia, \ncoma and death. Typically, ingestion of poison hemlock is due to misidentification because of its \nsimilarity in appearance to wild carrots.",

It is a competitive \nantagonist of glycine at the postsynaptic receptors in the motor neurons of the anterior horn of \nthe spinal cord. This leads to increased activity in the motor neurons. The fatal dose is 15-30 mg of strychnine or one crushed seed. If death is preceded by a severe \nconvulsion, as in strychnine poisoning, it causes an increase in the body temperature \ncalled postmortem caloricity. The toxin strychnine does not affect any receptors in the brain and the person remains conscious \ntill death. Strychnine poisoning is characterized by conscious seizures.",

The roots are the most poisonous part of the \nplant and are mistaken for horseradish root. The toxic principle is aconitine. It acts on the voltage-sensitive sodium channels of the cell \nmembranes of excitable tissues. Aconitine first stimulates and then paralyzes the peripheral \nterminations of sensory and secretory nerves, CNS, and nerves of the myocardium, skeletal and \nsmooth muscles. Patients present mainly with a combination of gastrointestinal, cardiovascular, and neurological \nfeatures. Numbness and tingling are characteristic features. The fatal period is 2-6 hours. Aconite is commonly used for homicidal poisoning because: • Cheap and easily available • Short fatal period • Extremely unstable and destroyed by putrefaction",

      "explanation": "Snakes of the Elapidae family are found to be able to control the injection of venom when they are \nbiting. Because of this, they can decide when to inject venom and when not to, this leads to the frequent \noccurrence of a dry bite in the case of Elapidae (they choose not to inject venom). Crotalinae snakes (pit viper) which are part of the Viperidae family, also have voluntary control \nover the injection of venom and 25% of their bites are dry.",

      },
      "correct_answer": "d",
      "explanation": "Constriction bands may be useful, especially when immediate medical care is not available. A constriction band is an elastic bandage or Penrose drain, thick rope, or piece of clothing \nwrapped circumferentially above the bite. It is applied with enough tension to restrict superficial \nvenous and lymphatic flow while maintaining distal pulses and capillary filling. Measures that can be done in the case of snakebite: • Apply firm pressure over the bitten area, which delays absorption of venom 344 \nSold by @itachibot • Pressure immobilization is recommended for elapid and sea-snake bites, but not for viper bites \nas it may cause local necrosis • Clean the wound with soap and water, or iodine and cover with a sterile dressing • Immediately apply a broad firm bandage (Sutherland wrap) on the bitten area and around the \nlimb. As much of the limb should be bandaged as is possible. It should be tight enough to occlude \nthe superficial venous and lymphatic return, but not the arterial or deep venous flow. A pressure \nof 50 to 70 mm Hg is maintained • In bites on the trunk, head, or neck, apply firm pressure over the bitten area • Immobilize the limb, as movement can accelerate the spread of venom • Make the patient lie on one side in the recovery position so that the airway is clear, in case of \nvomiting or fainting Measures contraindicated in the case of snakebite: • Suction and incision of the wound • Electric shock treatment of wound site • Application of tourniquets because they obstruct arterial flow and cause ischemia • Ice water immersion of the bitten limb",

Spanish fly is green in color with shiny wings of the same color. Cantharidin is an animal poison \nproduced by cantharides (Spanish fly or blister beetle). It causes vesicle or blister formation and \npriapism. The insect as such or the powder of dried body has the toxic (active) principle cantharidin.

        "a": "Physostigmine",

      },
      "correct_answer": "c",
      "explanation": "Prazosin acts as a physiological antidote for scorpion venom. The venom is a clear, colorless, proteinous toxalbumen, having a hemolytic and neurotoxic effect. \nIts toxicity is more than that of snakes, but only a small quantity is injected. The venom is a \npotent autonomic stimulator, resulting in the release of massive amounts of catecholamines from \nthe adrenals. If the scorpion has hemolytic venom, the reaction is mainly local and simulates the viper snake \nbite. The scorpion sting will have only one hole in the center of the reddened area. The extremity \nwill have edema, pain, and reddening. This usually lasts for one to two hours. The symptoms produced by a neurotoxic venom are similar to a cobra bite. There is usually no \nmarked reaction in the local area. Nausea, vomiting, extreme restlessness, fever, various types of \nparalysis, cardiac arrhythmias, convulsions, coma, respiratory depression, and death may occur \nwithin hours from pulmonary edema or cardiac failure. Prazosin can counteract the alpha-adrenergic effects of autonomic stimulation, such as \nhypertension.",
