      "explanation": "The image shows petechiae called Tardieu spots. They are an unreliable sign of asphyxial death. Hemorrhages if larger than 2 mm are called ecchymoses and smaller than 2 mm are called \npetechiae. They are common non-specific autopsy findings and many are post-mortem in origin, \nespecially in the dependent positions. They are caused by the rupture of small venules (capillary \nbleeding is invisible to the naked eye). It is suggested that the elevated expression of P-selectin could be used as a criterion to \ndistinguish between antemortem findings from post-mortem artifacts. Other non-specific signs of asphyxia are: • Congestion of the larynx with slight oozing • Emphysematous, congested lungs with serosanguinous fluid exudates in alveoli • Cyanosis or dark-colored blood due to accumulation of CO2.",

      "correct_answer": "b",
      "explanation": "The most marked congestion and cyanosis are seen in a case of traumatic asphyxia. It is the mechanical fixation of the chest (sitting on the chest). It acts by restricting respiratory \nmovements and thus prevents inspiration. The four signs of asphyxia are as follows. • Petechial haemorrhages • Congestion and edema • Cyanosis • Engorgement of the right heart and abnormal fluidity of the blood. These signs are non-specific. But in traumatic asphyxia, there is a marked demonstration of these \nsigns. In no other condition, apart from postural dependency, is the degree of congestion and \ncyanosis so marked.

Circumoral and \ncircumnasal pallor can be caused merely by passive pressure of the dependent head after death. Note: The coexistence of these findings, in themselves, does not prove that death resulted from \nmechanical asphyxia. All these phenomena are non-specific and are in no way peculiar to this \nmode of death. They are of no value in proving that death resulted from mechanical asphyxia.",

      "correct_answer": "d",
      "explanation": "The clinical scenario is most likely suggestive of cafe coronary syndrome. Death in café coronary \nsyndrome occurs due to parasympathetic overactivity. It is sudden and unexpected and happens \nrapidly. This is usually seen in well-built businessmen. In this syndrome, the victim dies during a meal \nwith no signs of respiratory distress or classical signs of asphyxia. The cause of death in these patients is mechanical asphyxia leading to vasovagal reflex causing \nreflex cardiac inhibition. The mode of death is cardiac arrest (not the cause of death) presumably \nfrom parasympathetic overactivity occurring from stimulation of the laryngeal or pharyngeal \nmucosa. Suppressed gag reflex due to gross intoxication with alcohol or large doses of tranquilizers in \nmental institutions or hospitals might be the predisposing factors. Autopsy reveals a bolus of food, \nlodged in the pharynx or larynx. 203 \nSold by @itachibot",

During manual strangulation the following structures are damaged: • Hyoid cornua or horns • Superior thyroid horns • Cricoid cartilage • The main ala of the thyroid cartilage It has been said that such direct violence from the front tends to splay the fractured horns \nlaterally, whereas in manual strangulation the horn tends to fall medially. If there is no haemorrhage, the fracture must be post mortem. If there is a small bleed, then the \nlesion can be either antemortem or post-mortem. Large bleeds definitely indicate an antemortem \nfracture. Damage to the laryngeal cartilages is much less common in ligature strangulation than in manual \nstrangulation.",

      "explanation": "Dribbling of saliva will be seen in a case of suicidal hanging. This is considered as the surest sign \nof antemortem hanging as secretion of saliva is a vital function and it cannot occur after death. Autopsy findings in hanging: • Post-mortem hypostasis is present in the legs and hands. • Petechial haemorrhages - these are usually the exception, rather than the rule. • Ligature mark - above the thyroid cartilage, incomplete, parchment-like consistency • Soft tissue haemorrhage may be seen. • Laryngeal fractures - fractures of hyoid and thyroid may be seen. • Amussat sign - damage to intima and media of the carotid artery • Simon's sign - haemorrhages on the anterior aspects of intervertebral disks. • Vertebral artery tears- The vertebral artery can show intimal tears, subintimal haemorrhages, \nand even rupture. • A pale face is more commonly seen than congestion of the face. • Le facies sympathique - eyes remain open and pupils remain dilated due to compression of \ncervical sympathetic chain on the same side. It indicates antemortem hanging. 210 \nSold by @itachibot",

      "explanation": "The given scenario is an example of burking. Burking is a method of homicidal smothering and traumatic asphyxia where the assaulter kneels \nor sits on the chest (traumatic asphyxia) and close the nose and mouth with his hands \n(smothering). This was the method of killing performed by William Burke and William Hare. Image shows burking Other options: Option B: Smothering is a form of asphyxia that is caused by closing the external respiratory \norifices either by the hand or by other means or blocking up the cavities of the nose and mouth by 212 \nSold by @itachibot a foreign substance, such as mud, paper, cloth, etc. Below image shows smothering Option C: Traumatic asphyxia results from respiratory arrest due to mechanical fixation of the \nchest, by a heavy substance or object. The normal movements of the chest wall are prevented. \nThere is a gross compression of the chest and usually abdomen by a powerful force, due to which \nchest expansion and diaphragmatic lowering are prevented. For example stampede deaths, \ncrushing by falls of the earth in coal mines, or earthquakes. Option D: Overlaying or compression suffocation results due to compression of the chest, so as to \nprevent breathing. It occurs when an intoxicated parent or other person shares a bed with an \ninfant. The thoracic movements are limited and respiratory exchange is either reduced or \ncompletely prevented which leads to death. It is always accidental.
