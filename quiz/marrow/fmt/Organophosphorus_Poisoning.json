      "explanation": "The given clinical scenario is suggestive of organophosphorus (OP) poisoning. Clinical effects are \ndue to the inhibition of acetylcholinesterase.

Maintenance of nutrition, \nphysiotherapy, prevention of bed sores and other routine measures to minimise discomfort along \nwith ventilatory care are management options. Four clinical syndromes are identified with respect to organophosphate exposure. They include: • Acute poisoning - This results in CNS, muscarinic, nicotinic, and somatic motor manifestations. • Intermediate syndrome - It is usually observed 1-5 days after OP exposure. It is characterized by \nparalysis of neck flexors, muscles innervated by cranial nerves, proximal limb muscles, and \nrespiratory muscles. • Chronic toxicity - It is seen primarily in agricultural workers with daily exposure. It manifests as \nsymmetrical sensorimotor axonopathy. • Organophosphate-induced delayed neuropathy - This is characterized by cognitive dysfunction, \nextrapyramidal symptoms, and peripheral neuropathy. It can lead to flaccid paralysis and muscle \nwasting.",

      },
      "correct_answer": "b",
      "explanation": "Pralidoxime causes reversal of tongue fasciculations (nicotinic symptoms). Since atropine does not bind to nicotinic receptors, it is ineffective in treating neuromuscular \ndysfunction. Pralidoxime (2-PAM) and other oximes, such as HI-6 and obidoxime, are \ncholinesterase-reactivating agents. Hence, its coadministration with atropine is effective in \ntreating both muscarinic and nicotinic symptoms. Pralidoxime reactivates the acetylcholinesterase, which had been deactivated in organophosphate \npoisoning. Pralidoxime attaches to the anionic site of the enzyme that remains unoccupied. Then \nit reacts with the phosphorus atom of the organophosphorous compound which is attached to the \nesteric site to form a phospho-oxime complex. It then dissociates from the enzyme, regenerating \nthe active enzyme. Pralidoxime should not be administered without concurrent atropine, in order to prevent \nworsening of symptoms due to transient oxime-induced acetylcholinesterase inhibition. Note: Muscle cramps are nicotinic symptoms. However, abdominal cramps are muscarinic \nsymptoms.",

This syndrome \ndevelops one to several days after the poisoning, during the recovery from cholinergic \nmanifestations. In some cases, it can occur when patients have completely recovered from the 275 \nSold by @itachibot initial cholinergic crisis.
