      "explanation": "300 \nSold by @itachibot There are no significant gender differences concerning renal elimination affecting the Blood \nAlcohol Concentration(BAC) levels. BAC following the ingestion of ethanol is influenced by many factors. These include: • Weight - Women on average are smaller than men, so have less fluid in their bodies for alcohol \ndistribution • Body fat percentage - Since women have greater body fat, their aqueous compartment is smaller \nand hence they achieve a higher BAC. • Gastric alcohol dehydrogenase - Some ethanol is broken down in the stomach by gastric alcohol \ndehydrogenase, which lowers the amount available for absorption. This enzyme is present at \nhigher levels in men than in women.",

According to this section, an act is considered a crime only if done with certain knowledge or \nintent, a person who commits the act while intoxicated will be assumed to have had that \nknowledge as if they were not intoxicated. This assumption does not apply if the person was \nintoxicated without their knowledge or against their will. 303 \nSold by @itachibot Option A: Section 84 IPC (Sec 22 BNS) - Act of a person of unsound mind—No act is an offence \nwhich is undertaken by a person who, at the time of doing it, by reason of unsoundness of mind, \nis incapable of knowing the nature of the act or understanding of what is being done is either \nwrong or contrary to law. This does not apply to the man, who was not of unsound mind. Section \n84 IPC (Sec 22 BNS) does apply in the case of delirium tremens. Section 85 IPC (Sec 23 BNS)- No act is an offence which is done by a person who at the time of \ndoing it, by reason of intoxication, is incapable of knowing the nature of the act or what he is \ndoing is either wrong or contrary to law; provided that what intoxicated him was administered to \nhim without his knowledge or against his will.

Option C: Section 510 IPC (Sec 355 BNS) - Misconduct by a drunken person in public is \npunishable with imprisonment of up to 24 hours.

Fomepizole, an alcohol dehydrogenase inhibitor is indicated in methanol toxicity. It acts by \ninhibiting the formation of toxic formic acid. Intravenous ethanol is an alternative to fomepizole.
