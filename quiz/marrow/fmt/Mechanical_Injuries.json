This is not the same as a negative vital reaction as it is indicative of \ndecreased enzymatic activity and is seen in antemortem wounds. Vital reactions are local tissue reactions at the site of tissue damage. Only antemortem wounds \nshow vital reactions as cells are active at the time of wound infliction. The vital reactions of an \nantemortem wound are of two zones: • Negative vital reaction (decrease in enzymatic activity of wound): It occurs in the central necrotic \narea, close to the edge of the wound where there is irreversible damage to tissues. • Positive vital reaction (increase in enzymatic activity of wound): It occurs just outside the \nnecrotic area of the wound in order to salvage damaged (but not irreversibly damaged) tissues.

Capillary bleeding \nwould not be visible to the naked eye. 115 \nSold by @itachibot A pure bruise lies beneath an intact epidermis. There is an extravascular collection of blood that \nhas leaked from blood vessels damaged by mechanical impact. The usual bruise from a blunt impact is situated in the subcutaneous tissues, often in the fat layer. \nObese people tend to bruise more easily due to the greater volume of subcutaneous tissue. Delayed bruising refers to bruises that become more prominent with the passage of hours or days. \nThis is caused by the percolation of blood from deeper tissues upwards towards the epidermis. It \nis also partly due to continued bleeding from the ruptured vessels.",

      "correct_answer": "c",
      "explanation": "The most useful criterion for dating a bruise is Perl's reaction for detecting haemosiderin. It \nbecomes positive about 24–90 hours after infliction. Sometimes, there can be an earlier \nappearance, even down to 12 hours. Color changes in a bruise cannot be reliably used to estimate the age of a bruise. The most \nsignificant change is the appearance of a yellow color. This indicates that the bruise is more than \n18 hours old.

      "explanation": "The bruise in the given image has a yellow appearance which is attributed to the presence of \nbilirubin. This finding makes the bruise about 7-12 days old. Bruises are mechanical injuries that are characterized by the extravasation of blood into \nsubcutaneous or subepithelial tissue spaces. The continuity of the overlying skin is preserved. \nThese injuries are typical consequences of blunt force trauma. The extravasated blood serves as a sign of inflammation to attract macrophages, which degrade \nthe hemoglobin into various compounds (hemosiderin, haematoidin, and bilirubin). This gives \nrise to shifting color changes that begin at the wound's periphery and migrate towards the center \nas time goes on.",

      "explanation": "116 \nSold by @itachibot Bruising at the nape of the neck does not indicate a fracture of the posterior cranial fossa. Ectopic bruises are also called migratory/percolated bruising. They are found at a different \nlocation than the actual site of injury. They are caused by the percolation of blood in the \nsubcutaneous tissue from one site to another. Examples are: • Black eye - due to actual trauma to the eye, or maybe an ectopic bruise. It may be from trauma to \nthe forehead or from a fracture of the anterior cranial fossa. The image below shows a black eye. • Battle sign - bruising seen over the mastoid process.

The suspected area is incised to see if the underlying blood is intravascular (hypostasis) or \ninfiltrating the tissues outside the vessels (contusion). Option A: Gettler's chloride test is used to differentiate between freshwater and saltwater \ndrowning. It is not widely used now. Option C: In the precipitin test, a specific antiserum is made to react with the seminal fluid, blood, \nor saliva. A positive test will confirm human origin.

      "explanation": "The image shows 'tram-line' bruising. It would have most likely been produced by a stick or \nan iron rod. It occurs when the skin surface is struck by a rod or rectangular sectioned object. The weapon \nsinks into the skin on impact. This causes the edges to drag the skin downwards and the traction, \ntears the marginal blood vessels. The centre compresses the skin.

      "correct_answer": "d",
      "explanation": "If the wound is parallel to the langer lines, it would appear normal. In contrast to a wound that is \nperpendicular to the Langer lines, which would be longer than normal. This is because such \nwounds tend to gape more, giving a false interpretation of the weapon. Option A: The taper of the blade is related to wound size. The length of the wound would be equal \nto the width of the blade at the point to which it was inserted. Thus the length of the wound varies \naccording to the depth to which it was inserted. Once the blade edges become parallel, the wound \nsize remains constant for further penetration of the knife. Option B: If a knife is driven up to the hilt, the depth of the wound as measured at autopsy may be \ngreater than the true length of the blade. This is usually seen in the abdomen, and to a lesser \nextent in the chest. A forceful stab can cause the abdominal or chest wall to indent, allowing the \nknife tip to reach tissues that would normally be beyond its reach. 119 \nSold by @itachibot Option C: If the weapon is moved after insertion, it distorts wound characteristics.",
