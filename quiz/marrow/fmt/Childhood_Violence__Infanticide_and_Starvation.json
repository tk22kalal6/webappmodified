      },
      "correct_answer": "d",
      "explanation": "USG showing Spalding’s sign is suggestive of maceration of the fetus. This sign refers to the \noverlapping of the fetal skull bones caused by the collapse of the fetal brain. Maceration is a process of aseptic autolysis occurring after the intrauterine death of the fetus. The \nprerequisite for the process of maceration to occur is that the dead fetus should be in utero for 3-4 \ndays and should be surrounded by the liquor amnii. If air enters the liquor amnii after the death \nof the fetus, putrefaction occurs instead of maceration. Note: Mummification is the term for a dry decomposition of a dead body, or conversion to waxy \nsubstances, called adipocere. 244 \nSold by @itachibot",

      "question": "Question 3: You are performing an autopsy on a fetus born dead at 6 months. Which of the following is \nleast likely to be seen in this case?",
      "options": {
        "a": "Mummification",
        "b": "Adipocere",
        "c": "Resorption",
        "d": "Maceration"
      },
      "correct_answer": "b",
      "explanation": "Adipocere formation cannot be an autopsy finding in the given scenario since fetuses under 7 \nmonths do not show this change. Adipocere is the formation of a soft greyish-white, waxy, greasy material with an offensive, sweet \nrancid smell, occurring in fatty tissues. It is due to postmortem hydrolysis or hydrogenation of the \nfats. It is a modification of putrefaction. It is seen most commonly in bodies immersed in water or \nin a damp, warm environment. Fetuses under 7 months do not show this change. If the pregnancy with the dead fetus continues, it may be gradually resorbed \nor mummified. Mummification occurs when the foetus dies from a deficient supply of blood, \nwhen liquor amnii is scanty, and when no air enters the uterus. It is also a finding in fetus \npapyraceous, which is the intrauterine demise of a fetal twin, where it is compressed between the \nmembranes and the uterine wall. The most important post-mortem change in an intrauterine death is maceration, which is \nan autolytic process by which there is self-disintegration of the body by cellular enzymes. This can \noccur if the death of the fetus happens days to months before the delivery.",

It is also known as \nfloatation test/ Breslau’s first life test/ Raygat’s test. If the lung pieces float in water, it means that respiration has taken place, indicating a live birth. If \nthe pieces sink, respiration has not taken place, which means it is stillborn. An unrespired lung (stillbirth) may float, giving a false positive test, due to gases of \ndecomposition, as seen in putrefaction.",

      "correct_answer": "a",
      "explanation": "Nobbing fracture is a feature of battered baby syndrome (infantile whiplash syndrome). In battered baby syndrome, violent squeezing of the chest from side to side causes fracture of \ncostochondral junctions and fracture along the posterior angles of the rib. After callus formation, which takes around 2 weeks, it gives a string of beads appearance in \nparavertebral region on X-ray, also known as nobbing fractures. Munchausen syndrome is also known as the factitious disorder imposed on self. Patients \ndeceptively misrepresent, simulate, or cause symptoms of an illness and/or injury in themselves, \neven in the absence of obvious external rewards such as financial gain, housing, or medications. Sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS) is defined as the sudden death of an infant, which remains \nunexplained after a thorough case investigation, including the performance of a complete autopsy, \nexamination of the death scene, and review of the clinical history.",

      "explanation": "The given clinical scenario is suggestive of battered baby syndrome. The classical feature of this \ncondition is injuries inflicted are of different ages and in different stages of healing. This is due to \nthe repetitive nature of child abuse. A battered child is one who has received repetitive physical injuries as a result of \nnon-accidental violence, produced by a parent or guardian, there may also be deprivation of \nnutrition, care, and affection. This syndrome must be considered in any child: • In whom the degree and type of injury varies with the history given • When injuries are of different ages and in different stages of healing • When there is a purposeful delay in seeking medical attention despite serious injury • Who exhibits evidence of fracture of any bone, subdural hematoma, failure to thrive, soft tissue \nswelling or skin bruising • Who dies suddenly Skeletal survey, which includes the following, should be done in a case of suspected child abuse: • AP views of the entire skeleton • Dedicated views of hands and feet 246 \nSold by @itachibot • Lateral views of appendicular skeleton, skull, and spine",

      "question": "Question 9: A 2-month-old previously healthy baby was brought to the casualty when the parents found \nthat the baby was not breathing while asleep. Following resuscitative measures, the baby was \nstill apnoeic, pulseless, and asystolic. You suspected sudden infant death syndrome in this \nchild. Which of the following is not a risk factor of this condition?",

        "a": "Sharing a bed with a family member",

        "c": "Sleeping in prone position or on the side",
        "d": "Overheating while sleeping"
      },
      "correct_answer": "b",
      "explanation": "Sleeping on hard/ firm surfaces is not associated with sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS). Crowded sleeping areas with many pillows, blankets, and stuffed toys, or old, soft mattresses are \nassociated with an increased risk of SIDS. SIDS is also known as a 'cot' or 'crib' death. Usually, the parent finds the infant expired in the crib \nafter putting them to sleep. It is an unexpected death in a healthy infant, whose autopsy may not \nreveal a cause of death. 70% of cases of SIDS are found at autopsy to have intrathoracic petechiae in the pleura, \nepicardium, and thymus. However, this feature is considered to be an agonal phenomenon. The \npresence of this feature alone should not raise concern for manual suffocation. Most cases of SIDS occur between 1-7 months of age but can occur up to 2 years. The risk \nincreases with male infants, multiple births, colder climates, and lower socioeconomic status \nfamilies. Ways to reduce the risk of SIDS include: • Avoiding sharing a bed with the infant • Abstinence from smoking • Using hard/firm bedding and keeping the sleeping area clear • Ensuring the infant sleeps supine • Keeping the room temperature comfortable • Breastfeeding Option A: Sharing a bed with a family member is associated with SIDS. The risk is augmented if \nthe parent has consumed alcohol or sedative medications. Option C: Sleeping prone or on the side is strongly associated with SIDS. The risk of regurgitation \nand choking is high in infants who sleep prone. These positions are associated with instability. Option D: Overheating while sleeping can occur if the baby has a fever or has been placed in \nexcessive clothing or in a warm room. Overheating has been associated with SIDS. 247 \nSold by @itachibot",

      "explanation": "Sexual assault done by a police officer is an aggravated sexual assault according to POCSO \n(Protection of Children from Sexual Offences). The POCSO act defines a child as any person below eighteen years of age. It defines various forms \nof sexual offenses which include: • Sexual harassment - Threatening • Sexual assault - Any act with sexual intent that involves physical contact without penetration. • Aggravated sexual assault - Similar to sexual assault along with the criteria explained under the \nterm aggravated • Penetrative sexual assault - An act with sexual intent that involves physical penetration of the \npenis or any object into the vagina, mouth, urethra, or anus. 248 \nSold by @itachibot • Aggravated penetrative sexual assault - Similar to penetrative sexual assault along with the \ncriteria explained under the term aggravated • Pornography The term aggravated is used for those assaults done: • By a person in a position of trust or authority such as a police officer, security force, relative, \ndoctor • In the course of communal violence • On mentally &amp; physically disabled • Gang sexual assault • Using deadly weapons • Causing grievous hurt Depending on if there was penetration or not, it can be aggravated sexual assault (if there is no \npenetration) or aggravated penetrative sexual assault (if there was penetration). Both are different. The Act prescribes stringent punishment graded as per the gravity of the offence, with a \nmaximum term of rigorous imprisonment for life and fine.
