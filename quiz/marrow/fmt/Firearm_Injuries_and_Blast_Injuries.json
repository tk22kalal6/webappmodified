Ballistics is the science of mechanics that deals with the flight, behaviour and effects of projectiles. \nIt has the following types: • Internal ballistics deals with the processes in a firearm. • External/Exterior ballistics deals with the behaviour of the projectile after leaving the barrel. • Wound ballistics comprises the changes caused when a missile penetrates a human or animal \nbody. • Forensic ballistics is the application of ballistics for forensic purposes • Terminal ballistics deals with the study of the interaction of a projectile with its target.",

      "explanation": "Choking is a modification applied to the barrel of a shotgun. Choke is where the barrel is modified such that it slightly tapers towards the muzzle. This will \nproduce a narrower cone of shot when the ammunition is fired and thus, prevents dispersion of \npellets. This can thus affect estimation of range of firing when examining the entry wound. Types of choking: • Improved cylinder • Modified choke • Half-choke • Full-choke Note: The choke is a device towards the tapered end of the muzzle of a shotgun that aids in the \nestimates of range derived from the size of the wound and controls the shot pattern. It does not \nincrease the range of the shotgun thus making option A the appropriate choice.",

Secondary markings are used for bullet fingerprinting. 177 \nSold by @itachibot Rifling is the process of adding spiral grooves on to the inside of the barrel of a gun. The \nelevations between the grooves are called 'lands'. These grip the bullet and impart onto it a \nrotatory movement. This has a gyroscopic effect that increases the stability of the bullet's \ntrajectory and hence the accuracy.",

The abrasion collar or its inner parts may be blackened due to overlying sooty remnants wiped off \nby the bullet when hitting uncovered skin. This finding is called a grease ring, a ring of dirt or \nbullet wipe-off. It can be regarded as a reliable sign of entrance. Option A: Inverted edges cannot be regarded as a reliable sign of entry wound. The edges of an \nentry wound may be everted by the blowback phenomenon in a contact wound. This occurs when \nthe gases strike a bony surface and are reflected back, everting the entry wound edges. Option B: The round shape of entry wounds is unreliable as entry wounds and exit wounds may \nbe of many shapes. This depends on many factors, including the range of firing, angle of firing, \npresence of subcutaneous bone, etc. Option C: In an abrasion collar the skin immediately around the central hole is discoloured, the \nso-called ‘abrasion collar’ or ‘contusion ring’. The abrasion ring is primarily due to the massive \noverstretching and subsequent drying-up of the skin adjacent to the area of projectile impact.

To ensure transfer of energy to the tissues, some missiles are especially designed or modified to \nslow up or stop within the body. • Softheaded bullets will flatten on impact and some are designed to fragment. • The dumdum bullet fragments upon striking and transfers more energy for tissue displacement \nand disruption. • Explosive-tipped bullets, cause fire in the target due to the presence of explosives at the tip.

It is the rotation of the \nbullet around a lateral axis while passing through dense media such as tissues. The angle between the trajectory and the long axis of the bullet increases due to destabilising \nforces until it reaches 90 degrees , i.e., the bullet’s long axis is perpendicular to the trajectory. The \nyawing motion then continues until 180 degrees and the bullet will remain in this stable position \nwhere the base is the leading part.

Precautions to be followed while recovering a bullet from a crime scene: 186 \nSold by @itachibot • Bullets should be handled only by persons wearing double heavy-duty gloves (and not by bare \nhands - due to risk of contamination). • To prevent marring of the bullet surface, it should be removed by a plastic forceps or a \nrubber-tipped bullet extractor. • The bullet is gently rinsed after collection of any trace evidence on the bullet. The rinsing \nremoves any contaminating body fluids to decrease infective risk. • The bullet or bullet fragments should be double packed in leakproof packaging with at least one \nof the containers made out of hard plastic.",

A blast causes the most damage at an interface between tissues in contact with the atmosphere, \nwhich is why the lung usually suffers the most severe damage. However the most commonly \naffected structure in air blasts is the tympanic membrane. 189 \nSold by @itachibot The gastrointestinal system suffers from the effect of a blast because, like the lung, it contains air \nand gases, and is thus not a uniform medium for transit of the shock wave. Victims of explosions in water suffer a reverse order of gastrointestinal to lung damage. Note: In air, the ear, especially the tympanic membrane is severely damaged, however, in a \ncadaver it is not discernible without an otoscopic examination of the tympanic membrane. \nNevertheless, lungs are considered to be the severely damaged organ in the air due to variations in \ndensity between the alveolar walls and the contained air.",

      "explanation": "The given history of multiple small puncture wounds to the right side of the chest, below the \nnipple, and multiple small abrasions and bruising over the left lower abdomen are highly \nsuggestive of blast injuries sustained due to flying missiles. Blast injury is a complex type of physical trauma resulting from direct or indirect exposure to an \nexplosion causing a sudden increase or decrease in atmospheric pressure. T.K.Marshall’s (Marshall's triad) described the characteristic injuries associated with bomb \nexplosions. It includes: • Abrasions • Bruises/contusions • Puncture lacerations Blast injuries are classified as: • Primary injuries: Effect of transmitted blast waves on gas-containing structures. The external \ninjuries are absent and are characterized by internal injuries. The middle, ear, lungs, and \ngastrointestinal tract are the most susceptible to this. • Secondary injuries: Injuries caused by shrapnel and other airborne debris propelled by the \nexplosion. These injuries may affect any part of the body and sometimes result in penetrating \ntrauma. Most casualties are caused by secondary injuries. • Tertiary injuries: These are caused by blast wind that can throw victims against solid objects. • Quaternary injuries: All other injuries caused by explosions are not included in the above three \ncategories. eg, flash burns, crush injuries, respiratory effects due to toxic dust, gas, etc. Option B: Blast of air or blast wave cause primary injuries which involve internal organs without \nexternal injury. Option C: Explosion burns: When the bomb explodes, the temperature of the explosive gases can \nexceed 2000°C, and the heat radiated momentarily can cause flash burns. It is a quaternary type \nof blast injury. Option D: Building collapse can cause crush injuries which is a quaternary blast injury. 190 \nSold by @itachibot Mechanical Asphyxia",
