    "correct_answer": "d",
    "explanation": "Autosomal recessive disorders usually manifest in childhood or earlier. Heterozygotes are unaffected by the disease.

    "explanation": "The given clinical scenario is suggestive of hemophilia A. It is an X-linked recessive disorder. Hemophilia is of two types: • Hemophilia A - due to mutations in the F8 gene leading to factor VIII deficiency • Hemophilia B - due to mutations in the F9 gene leading to factor IX deficiency Affected children often present with prolonged bleeding after procedures like circumcision or \nmajor bleeds like intracranial hemorrhages. When the child begins to walk, bleeding into the joint \n(hemarthrosis) may occur, causing painful swellings and reddening. Laboratory investigations show elevated aPTT, with normal PT and platelet count. It is treated by \nthe administration of factor VIII or factor IX concentrates.",

    "correct_answer": "a",
    "explanation": "The Hardy-Weinberg law is related to population genetics. Population genetics is the study of the \nprecise genetic composition of a population and various factors determining the incidence of \ninherited traits in them. Founder effect is a violation to this law. It is due to difference in expression of the genes in \nfounding population. This is responsible for the difference in the distribution of disease in \npopulation.",
