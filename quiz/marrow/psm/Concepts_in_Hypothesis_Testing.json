Even though both treatments have similar rates of remission, a valid statistical test is required to \ndetermine the difference in their effectiveness. Statistically, p-value &lt; 0.05 implies that the \nalternate hypothesis is true. In this scenario, we can consider: • Null hypothesis: Both the treatments are equally effective (in other terms, there is no difference \nbetween the effect of the two treatments). • Alternative hypothesis: New treatment is more effective than the usual treatment. As the p-value is 0.04, which is statistically significant (&lt;0.05), the null hypothesis is rejected \nand the alternative hypothesis is accepted. Hence the new treatment is more effective than the \nusual treatment. 855 \nSold by @itachibot Tests of Significance",
