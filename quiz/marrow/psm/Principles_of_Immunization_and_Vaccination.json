    "explanation": "Live vaccines should generally be avoided for 12 weeks following an injection of normal human \nimmunoglobulin (Ig). If a live vaccine has already been administered, the injection of normal \nhuman Ig should be delayed for 2 weeks. NHIG is an antibody-rich fraction that is usually obtained from a pool of at least 1,000 donors. \nAN NHIG preparation must contain at least 90% intact IgG and minimal IgG aggregates with low \nIgA concentration. NHIG is commonly used to prevent measles and hepatitis A infections.

Primary response is the immune response developed when an antigen is administered for the first \ntime to a person who has never been exposed to it. There is a latent period of 3-10 days before \nantibodies appear in the blood. Secondary booster response is the immune response elicited by a booster dose. In comparison to a \nprimary immune response, it has a shorter latent period, faster production of antibodies, and 155 \nSold by @itachibot an abundance of antibodies.

      "d": "Live vaccines contain both major and minor antigens"
    },
    "correct_answer": "a",
    "explanation": "Simultaneous administration of vaccines is defined as administering more than one vaccine on the \nsame clinic day, at different anatomic sites. They are not combined in the same syringe. Simultaneous administration of the most widely used live and inactivated vaccines does not result \nin decreased antibody responses or increased rates of adverse reaction. However, in children with \nfunctional or anatomic asplenia pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV13) and Menactra brand \nmeningococcal conjugate vaccines should not be administered at the same visit; separate these \nvaccines by at least 4 weeks. Advantages of simultaneous administration of vaccines: • The organisms multiply in the host and thus, the antigenic dose is larger than what is injected. • They have all the major and minor antigenic components. Live vaccines should not be administered to those with an immunocompromised state, since they \nmay cause severe systemic disease by way of viremia/bacteriemia. Note: If live vaccines are not given simultaneously, they must be spaced as follows- • The administration of two live parenteral vaccines or live intranasal influenza vaccines must be \nseparated by at least 4 weeks (28 days). • If two live vaccines are given less than 4 weeks apart, the second vaccine should be repeated in \nfour weeks. This is because the live vaccine given first can interfere with the second vaccine, and \nthe person may not develop active immunity to the second vaccine.",

    "correct_answer": "c",
    "explanation": "The only absolute contraindication to administration of an inactivated or killed vaccine is severe \nlocal or general reaction to a previous dose of the vaccine. Inactivated or killed vaccines are made from growing cultures of the organism and then \ninactivating them with heat or chemicals.They activate the channels of active immunity after \ninjection and are less efficacious than live vaccines. Multiple doses or booster doses are usually \nrequired to produce an adequate antibody response. 156 \nSold by @itachibot Killed vaccines can be given to immune-compromised individuals and in pregnancy as the \ninfective agent is inactivated and cannot grow.

    "correct_answer": "b",
    "explanation": "The minimum interval between the administration of two live vaccines is 4 weeks. This is because decreasing the interval between two doses may interfere with the antibody \nresponse and protection. Thus, live vaccines can either be given on the same day according to the \nschedule or 4 weeks apart. Note: In Park 27th ed. the minimum interval between two live vaccines is given as 3 weeks. \nHowever, several other standard sources including CDC and UNDP suggested an interval of 4 \nweeks.

Live vaccines should generally be avoided for 12 weeks following an injection of normal human \nimmunoglobulin (Ig). If a live vaccine has already been administered, the injection of normal \nhuman Ig should be delayed for 2 weeks.

    "correct_answer": "b",
    "explanation": "Polysaccharide-based vaccines stimulate an antibody response against the surface polysaccharide \nof the pathogenic-capsulated bacteria. The polysaccharide structure varies not only between \nbacteria of different species but also between different strains within a single species. Thus, a \nlimitation of these vaccines is that the immune responses are serotype-specific. 157 \nSold by @itachibot If these vaccines are conjugated with proteins, they are given the capability of eliciting a stronger \nimmune response. Multivalent formulations of both polysaccharide-based vaccines and \nconjugated vaccines are required to achieve protection against multiple serotypes.",
