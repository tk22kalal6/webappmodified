    },
    "correct_answer": "a",
    "explanation": "The Bangalore method of composting is an anaerobic process. Composting is a method of combined disposal of refuse and nightsoil. In this process, organic \nmatter is broken down into compost. It has manure value and few or no disease-causing \npathogens. Bangalore method is an anaerobic method and is also called hot fermentation \nprocess. Trenches with a depth of not more than 90cm are used for this. This is done by spreading \na layer of refuse (15 cm thick) at the bottom of the trench and nightsoil (5cm thick) is added next. \nLayers of refuse and nightsoil are added alternatively till the heap rises to 30cm above ground \nlevel. The heap is then covered with excavated earth. At the end of 4 – 6 months, decomposition \nwill be completed. Mechanical composting is an aerobic process. In this method, compost is manufactured on a large \nscale by processing raw materials and turning out a finished product. The refuse is first cleared of \nsalvageable materials. It is then pulverised to reduce the size of particles to less than 2 inches. The \npulverised refuse is then mixed with sewage, sludge or nightsoil in a rotating machine and \nincubated.",
