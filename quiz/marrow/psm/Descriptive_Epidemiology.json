Types of epidemiological studies: • Observational studies - allow nature to take its own course, the investigator measures but does \nnot intervene. • Descriptive studies - limited to the description of the occurrence of a disease in a population. • Analytical studies - go further by analyzing the relationship between health status and other \nvariables. • Ecological studies • Cross-sectional studies • Case-control studies • Cohort studies • Experimental studies or intervention studies involve an active attempt to change a disease \ndeterminant or the progress of a disease and are similar in design to experiments in other \nsciences. • Randomized controlled trials • Field trials • Community trials",

The hypothesis can subsequently be rejected or accepted. Experimental studies involve an intervention to provide scientific proof for etiological risk factors \nof diseases and to measure the efficiency of health services.",

    "correct_answer": "a",
    "explanation": "This outbreak of viral hepatitis A is an example of a common source, multiple exposure type of \nepidemic. The incubation period of hepatitis A is approximately 28 days (range 15 to 50 days). In this \nscenario, the cases of viral hepatitis A have occurred over a period from June to September (120 \ndays) which is more than one incubation period of the disease. This is suggestive of multiple 88 \nSold by @itachibot exposures from a common source. If the period of the outbreak falls within one incubation period, then the type of epidemic is \ncommon source ,single exposure or point source epidemic. Difference between single exposure and multiple exposure epidemics: Propagated epidemic results from person to person transmission of the infectious agent over a \nprolonged duration of time. For e.g. Polio epidemic, COVID-19. Note: Hepatitis A epidemic is generally an example of a propagated epidemic. However, it does \nnot always follow this pattern. In the given scenario, since the outbreak lasts for a short \nduration of 3 months (about 3 incubation periods for hepatitis A), it is considered to be a point \nsource, multiple exposure outbreak.
