    "explanation": "Asepsis is the process designed to prevent microorganisms from reaching a protected \nenvironment. Sterilization is a process of killing or removal of all living microorganisms either in the vegetative \nor spore state from an area or surface or a medium. Decontamination is the process of rendering an article or area free of contaminants, including \nmicrobial, chemical, radioactive and other hazardous materials. Disinfection is the process by which the destruction of microorganisms is achieved with the use of \nphysical or chemical agents. Microbial forms like spores and some viruses may be resistant to \ncertain disinfectants.",

Traditional organisms used to test the power of the disinfectant \ninclude S. aureus and Salmonella enteric subtype typhi. Phenol coefficient = The dilution of test disinfectant which kills microorganisms in a given \ntime ÷ The dilution of phenol which kills the microorganism in the same time under identical \nconditions. 188 \nSold by @itachibot Other tests that are used for disinfectants are as follows: • Chick Martin test - modification of the Rideal-Walker test where disinfectants act in the presence \nof organic matter like feces or yeast to simulate natural conditions • Kelsey-Skyes test (capacity test) - tests the capacity of a disinfectant to retain its activity when \nused repeatedly. • In-use test - determines whether the chosen disinfectant is effective in actual hospital use Joseph Lister first introduced phenol (carbolic acid) as an antiseptic to sterilize surgical \ninstruments and clean wounds.
