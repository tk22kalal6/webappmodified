    "explanation": "890 \nSold by @itachibot The design effect is used in cluster sampling to allow for design structure and correlation between \nclusters. The design effect (DEFF) is used to decide the sample size needed for cluster sampling. This is \ndone by calculating the difference in sampling variability to the variability expected with simple \nrandom sampling (SRS). It can more simply be stated as the actual sample size divided by the effective sample size (what \nyou would expect if you were using SRS). For example, let’s say you were using cluster sampling. \nA DEFF of 2 means the variance is twice as large as you would expect with SRS. It also means that \nif you used cluster sampling, you’d have to use twice the sample size.",

    },
    "correct_answer": "a",
    "explanation": "Among the factors shown in the above statistical group, the odds ratio of early menarche, \nBRCA mutation, and obesity show positive association and are statistically significant. Hence \nthese 3 factors can be ascertained as risk factors. High socioeconomic status is not a risk factor. Even though there is a positive association, it is not \nstatistically significant. Any association that has a 95% confidence interval range that includes the \nvalue of 1.0 is considered to be non-significant. The value of 1.0 in the range means that the two \nfactors may co-exist together but one is not causing the other to happen. Odds ratio (OR) is the key parameter in case-control studies to assess the strength of association \nbetween the exposure and outcome. The interpretation of the odds ratio can be done as below: • OR &gt; 1 indicates a positive association. If both upper and lower limits of the 95% confidence \nlimits are also &gt;1, it suggests that the odds ratio is significant and the factor can be ascertained \nas a risk factor. • OR = 1indicates no association. Irrespective of the odds ratio, if the lower limit of 95% CI is &lt;1 \nand the upper limit of 95% CI &gt;1, the OR is non-significant and cannot be ascertained either as \na protective or a risk factor. • OR &lt; 1 indicates a negative association. If both upper and lower limits of the 95% confidence \nlimits are also &lt;1, it suggests that the odds ratio is significant and the factor can be ascertained \nas a protective factor.
