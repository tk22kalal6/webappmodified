    "correct_answer": "d",
    "explanation": "Percentile is a measure of position. It can be defined as a number that states the percentage of \nobservations that fall below any particular score. Measures of location help in summarizing the data by locating its centre or middle. The three \nmain measures of location include mean, median and mode. They are also called measures of \ncentral tendency.",

    },
    "correct_answer": "a",
    "explanation": "The mean can be worked out only for quantitative values. Thus, it can be calculated for interval \nor ratio scale data. A dichotomous scale is a type of nominal scale data that can take only two values. Example: Male/ \nFemale. For nominal scale data, the preferred measure of central tendency is mode. For ordinal \nscale data, both median and mode can be calculated. Median can be derived from ordinal, interval and ratio data scales. Mode can be derived from all \nscales of data- nominal, ordinal, interval and ratio.",

    "correct_answer": "b",
    "explanation": "The 50th centile can be obtained when values are arranged in order and the central value is \npicked out. This is the same as the median. In a distribution that has an odd number of elements, the median is the middle value. 812 \nSold by @itachibot In a distribution that has an even number of elements, the median is the average of the middle \nvalues, i.e., the arithmetic mean of the two middle values. An example of how to calculate the median of an odd and an even number of elements is given \nbelow. Option C: Geometric mean is obtained by taking the arithmetic mean of values on a logarithmic \nscale. Option D: Mean deviation is a measure of dispersion. The average of deviations from the \narithmetic mean gives the mean deviation.",

      "c": "Mode",
      "d": "Geometric mean"
    },
    "correct_answer": "c",
    "explanation": "The mode of a given sample can have more than one value. It is the most frequently occurring \nvalue in a distribution. For example, in the sample [1, 3, 6, 6, 6, 6, 7, 7, 12, 12, 17], the most repeated value i.e., the mode \nis 6. For the list of data [1, 1, 2, 4, 4], the mode is 1 and 4. Therefore, the mode is not unique. This \ndataset may be said to be bimodal, while a set with more than two modes may be described as \nmultimodal. Median can have only one value, obtained by arranging values in order and then picking out the \ncentral value. In a sample with an even number of elements, median is obtained by taking the \naverage of the middle 2 elements. Mean can only have a single value. The harmonic mean is the reciprocal of the arithmetic mean of \nthe reciprocals of the data values. The geometric mean is obtained by taking the arithmetic mean \nof values on a logarithmic scale. 813 \nSold by @itachibot",

    },
    "correct_answer": "a",
    "explanation": "Blood pressure usually forms a normal symmetrical distribution for which mean is the preferred \nmeasure of central tendency. Distributions of survival time, incubation period and health expenses have the probability of \nhaving extreme values, i.e., outliers. Thus, they form skewed distributions and in such \ncases, median is the preferred measure of central tendency.",

The data can be arranged in ascending order as 20, 25, 28, 31, 31, 31, 31, 35, 38. After arranging in order, the median is obtained by picking out the central value which is 31.

    },
    "correct_answer": "c",
    "explanation": "Out of the 11 birth weights, 2.5 kg would represent the middle value or the median. 5 babies weigh \nmore than 2.5 kg and 5 less than that. This can be understood from the image below. Option A: Mean or arithmetic mean is the average value. In this case, the mean is the average of \nall the 11 values. It need not be 2.5.

    "question": "Question 8: 807 \nSold by @itachibot You are conducting an epidemiological study on malaria in a town ç. The number of cases \nreported during the last 10 years is given below. What is the most appropriate measure of \ncentral tendency for this data?",

      "a": "Arithmetic Mean",
      "b": "Mode",
      "c": "Median",
      "d": "Geometric Mean"
    },
    "correct_answer": "c",
    "explanation": "In this scenario, median is the preferred measure of central tendency as there are outliers. The value of 5000 is an outlier in the given set, i.e., an observed value which is very distant from \nother observations in the distribution. This indicates the usage of median as the measure of \ncentral tendency as it is not sensitive to extreme values, unlike the mean. By arranging the data in order: 100, 160, 190, 250, 260, 300, 320, 320, 350, 5000, we get the \nmedian as (260 + 300) / 2 = 280. Options A and B: Mean is the most affected by the presence of outliers. Mode is the least affected \nby outliers but it is used mainly for measuring the central tendency of nominal data. Option D: Geometric mean can be used for datasets with extreme values but it is not used when \nthe values can be zero or negative. In the given scenario, the number of malaria cases reported in \na town can also have a zero value.",

    "question": "Question 9: During a school health assessment, the mean value of weight for a group of 10 boys was found \nto be 18.2 kg. Žater, it was found that the weight of one of the boys was wrongly recorded as \n2.0 kg instead of 20 kg. What is the true mean weight of the group?",

      "c": "16.4 kg",
      "d": "18.2 kg"
    },
    "correct_answer": "a",
    "explanation": "The true mean weight of the group is 20 kg. Mean is given as x■ = x / n, where n is the number of elements and x denotes the sum of all the \nelements in the series. In this scenario, the incorrect mean is 18.2, i.e., x / 10 = 18.2, making x = 182. But this is incorrect as one of the 10 weights was wrongly recorded as 2 instead of 20. The corrected x = (Incorrect x – incorrect value) + correct value. The incorrect sum of all elements = 182, incorrect value =2 and the correct value = 20. Thus, the correct sum of all the 10 weights would be, x = (182 – 2) + 20 = 200. From this, the correct mean value of the 10 weights can be given by: x / 10 = 200/ 10 = 20.",
