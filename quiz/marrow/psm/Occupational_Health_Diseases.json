      "d": "A diver who developed decompression sickness"
    },
    "correct_answer": "d",
    "explanation": "Barosinusitis occurs in decompression sickness or Caisson's disease. It is due to the sudden \nexpansion of air in the sinuses. It can be seen in: • Divers who ascend rapidly from deep-sea (high pressure) to the surface of the earth (low \npressure) • Pilots of unpressurized aircraft or mountaineers who rapidly ascended from the surface of the \nearth (high-pressure zone) to a high altitude (low-pressure zone) Under high pressure, gases get compressed, and their solubility increases. When a person is in \ndeep-sea (high-pressure zone) for a long time, an increased amount of nitrogen gets dissolved in \nhis body. When he suddenly comes back to the surface (atmospheric pressure or a low-pressure \nzone), the solubility of gases decreases and they escape from the dissolved state forming nitrogen \nbubbles. These bubbles can cause sudden expansion of air in various parts of the body such as the middle \near (barotitis), sinuses (barosinusitis), beneath teeth (barodontalgia), intestinal loops (abdominal \ndistension), and emphysema. Nitrogen bubbles can also cause chokes (dyspnoea), bends (joint pain), and prickles (nerve \nirritation). 698 \nSold by @itachibot The definitive treatment for Caisson's disease is recompression.",

      "c": "Anthracosis",

    },
    "correct_answer": "c",
    "explanation": "Progressive massive fibrosis (PMF) is associated with anthracosis. PMF classically develops in \nanthracosis and silicosis. Exposure to coal dust causes progressive lung injury called anthracosis. Initially, it manifests as \nsimple coal worker pneumoconiosis, which occurs after exposure for 10–12 years and is reversible. \nLater, it can progress to progressive massive fibrosis (PMF) which is irreversible.",

    "correct_answer": "c",
    "explanation": "Farmer's lung is a hypersensitivity pneumonitis caused by thermophilic actinomycetes \nlike Saccharopolyspora rectivirgula (formerly known as Micropolyspora faeni). It occurs due to \ninhalation of moldy hay and grains causing an immunological reaction. Woodworker's lung is a hypersensitivity pneumonitis caused by Alternaria species, and Bacillus \nsubtilis in persons exposed to oak, cedar, pine, and mahogany dust. Bird fancier's lung is caused by proteins derived from birds like pigeons and parakeets in persons \nexposed to their feathers and droppings.

      "d": "Onset of cancer does not occur after the person has left the industry"
    },
    "correct_answer": "c",
    "explanation": "The most common occupational cancer is squamous cell carcinoma of the skin. It is associated \nwith exposure to radiation, dyes, and coal tar. In occupational cancers, the age of incidence of cancer is earlier than that in the general \npopulation, affected by the same cancer type.
