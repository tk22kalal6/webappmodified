      "a": "Orthotolidine test measures only combined chlorine",
      "b": "Chlorine acts best when the pH of water is around seven",

      "d": "Hypochlorite ions are mainly responsible for its disinfectant activity"
    },
    "correct_answer": "b",
    "explanation": "Chlorine acts best when the pH of water is around seven because of the predominance of the \nhypochlorous acid. Most water sources have a pH around 6.5–7, making chlorination an effective \nform of disinfection. Option A: Orthotolidine test measures both free and combined chlorine in water. Option C: Chlorination kills pathogenic bacteria, but has no effect on spores and certain viruses. Option D: The disinfecting action of chlorine is mainly due to hypochlorous acid.",

    },
    "correct_answer": "d",
    "explanation": "The minimum level of free residual chlorine to be maintained in pipelines following an outbreak \nof cholera is 0.5 mg/litre. After a disaster (such as a flood), the water bodies are contaminated with sewage and drainage. \nThe mixing of faeces in drinking bodies increases the risk of numerous microbial infections. The \nadvisable level of free residual chlorine in water bodies after a disaster is, therefore, higher \ni.e. 0.7-0.9 mg/litre.",

    },
    "correct_answer": "b",
    "explanation": "Chlorine demand is the amount of chlorine that is needed to kill bacteria, and to oxidize all the \norganic matter and ammoniacal substances in the water.

    },
    "correct_answer": "c",
    "explanation": "The disinfectant property of bleaching powder is predominantly due to the action of hypochlorous \nacid. It is 70-80 times more effective than hypochlorite ions. Bleaching powder, also known as chlorinated lime (CaOCl2), has 33 per cent of chlorine in it. \nWhen chlorine is added to water, there is the formation of hydrochloric and hypochlorous acids. \nThe hydrochloric acid is neutralized by the alkalinity of the water. The hypochlorous acid ionizes \nto form hydrogen ions and hypochlorite ions, as follows: H2O + Cl2  HCl + HOCl HOCl  H + OCl",

    "explanation": "Microfiltration is a lower-pressure membrane process used for the treatment of water. Membrane processes are employed in the large scale treatment of water. They are classified \nas high-pressure processes and lower-pressure processes. • High-pressure processes: • Reverse osmosis - Rejects monovalent ions and organic molecules of molecular weight &gt; 50 \ndaltons. It is most commonly used for desalination of brackish water and sea water. The \nmembrane pore size is &lt; 0.002 µm. • Nanofiltration - Allows monovalent ions such as sodium or potassium to pass but rejects a high \nproportion of divalent ions like calcium and magnesium and some higher molecular weight \norganics. The membrane pore size ranges from 0.001 – 0.01 µm. • Lower-pressure processes: • Ultrafiltration - Rejects organic molecules of molecular weight &gt; 800 daltons. The membrane \npore size ranges from 0.002 - 0.003 µm. • Microfiltration - Rejects colloidal and suspended material. It does not separate molecules and is \nusually used before reverse osmosis.
