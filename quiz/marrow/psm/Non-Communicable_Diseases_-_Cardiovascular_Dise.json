    "explanation": "Filters are probably not protective against the development of coronary heart disease in smokers. Smoking is a modifiable risk factor for coronary heart disease (CHD). The degree of risk is directly \nrelated to the number of cigarettes smoked per day. Several mechanisms have been suggested for \nthis: • Carbon monoxide induced atherogenesis • Nicotine stimulation of adrenergic drive • Lipid metabolism with fall in levels of HDL Cigarettes also increase the risk of sudden death in patients with CHD who are below 50 years of \nage. The risk of death from CHD decreases with the cessation of smoking. The risk declines quite 328 \nSold by @itachibot substantially within one year of stopping smoking and more gradually thereafter until, after 10- \n20 years, it is the same as that of non-smokers.
