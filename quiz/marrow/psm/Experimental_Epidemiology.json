      "c": "Cohort studies",

    },
    "correct_answer": "b",
    "explanation": "Randomized controlled trials (RCT) are the strongest and best study design to prove \ncausation. They are the gold standard of clinical research. Case-control and cohort studies have a moderate ability to provide evidence for \ncausality. Ecological studies or correlational studies are considered as the weakest study design in \nthis aspect. The difference between analytical studies and randomised controlled trials is that in the former \nthere is no randomisation because it requires the participants to be divided into diseased and \nnon-diseased. This can lead to a number of biases that are avoided in RCTs. 117 \nSold by @itachibot",

      "d": "The sample may be referenced to a known population"
    },
    "correct_answer": "b",
    "explanation": "The main purpose behind randomisation is to eliminate selection bias. In an RCT, participants are randomly assigned to a study group or a control group. It is done only \nafter obtaining consent. It removes both known and unknown confounding factors. The heart of a randomized controlled trial (RCT) is randomisation. This allows comparability \nbetween the study and the control population.",

      "d": "The dropouts from the trial are not included in the analysis"
    },
    "correct_answer": "d",
    "explanation": "The dropouts from an RCT are included in the final analysis. This type of analysis is called \nintention-to-treat (ITT) analysis. It ignores noncompliance, protocol change, withdrawal, cross-over, and anything that happens \nafter randomization during analysis. The exclusion of dropouts may lead to the introduction \nof bias. Note: Per-protocol analysis is a comparison of treatment groups that include only those patients \nwho completed the treatment originally allocated to them. Hence, comparability between the \nstudy and control group is limited and randomisation is lost.",

      "b": "Concurrent parallel study design",
      "c": "Quasi trial",
      "d": "Per protocol analysis"
    },
    "correct_answer": "a",
    "explanation": "A cross-over study would be the best method to ensure comparability between the experimental \nand control group. In a cross over study design, patients are randomly assigned to the study and control group, and \nthen after a period of time, their groups are switched. Here, each patient serves as his/her own \ncontrol which allows for maximum comparability. In a concurrent parallel study design, comparisons are made between two randomly assigned \ngroups and there is no switching of groups. This allows only for limited comparability between \nexperimental and control groups. Quasi-experiments are studies that aim to evaluate interventions but that do not use \nrandomization. The lack of randomisation is the major weakness of quasi trials. The comparability \nin a quasi trial is limited. A per-protocol analysis is a comparison of treatment groups that include only those patients who \ncompleted the treatment originally allocated. Hence, comparability is limited. 118 \nSold by @itachibot",

    "correct_answer": "c",
    "explanation": "To test the given hypothesis that smokers are at a higher risk of developing lung carcinoma than \nthose who have quit, the study design chosen is a cessation experiment. The outcomes of termination of a habit or removal of an agent considered to be causally related to \na disease can be evaluated in a cessation experiment. It is a type of RCT and preventive trial. If the outcome is a significant reduction in disease then \nthe association of that habit or agent to the disease is strengthened. A trial of aetiological agents is an experimental epidemiological study to confirm or refute an \naetiological hypothesis. Clinical trials, for the most part, have been concerned with evaluating therapeutic agents, mainly \ndrugs. An uncontrolled trial is an example of a non-randomised trial where there is no control group for \ncomparison. 119 \nSold by @itachibot",
