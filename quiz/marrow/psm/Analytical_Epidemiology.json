It tries to determine the possible exposure factors after a known disease incidence. This is the first \napproach to test causal hypotheses and uses controls to support or refute an inference. Retrospective or historical cohort study, on the other hand, tries to compare the risk of developing \na disease to some already known exposure factors. Ex: risk of lung cancer in uranium miners, risk \nof angiosarcoma in persons exposed to polyvinyl chloride etc. Retrospective cohort studies are more economical and quicker than prospective cohort studies.",
