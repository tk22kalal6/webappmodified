Ex: Government provided latrines free of cost yet people did not use \nthem because its need was not felt Health education approach- creates awareness of health needs and problems. Awareness leads to \nmotivation which includes the stages of interest, evaluation, and decision-making. It is followed \nby acceptance of the new idea which becomes part of his existing values, known as internalization. \nEx: Adoption of ORS for diarrhea Primary health care approach- delivery of health services with the active involvement of people. \nPrinciples of community participation and intersectoral coordination are stressed here. Its \nobjective is to help individuals become self-reliant in health matters. Ex: People receive guidance \nfrom healthcare providers (Rogi Kalyana Samiti, Mahila Arogya Samiti).",
