    "correct_answer": "a",
    "explanation": "The correctly matched events relating to the given example are as follows: The WHO definition of impairment is \"any loss or abnormality of psychological, physiological or \nanatomical structure or function\". E.g., loss of a foot. An initial impairment may cause a \nsecondary impairment as well. The WHO defines disability as ''any restriction or lack of ability to perform an activity in the \nmanner or within the range considered normal for a human being\". Because of impairment, the \naffected person may be unable to carry out certain activities and hence the person is considered \ndisabled. According to the WHO, a handicap is \"a disadvantage for a given individual, resulting from an \nimpairment or a disability, that limits or prevents the fulfilment of a role that is normal \n(depending on age, sex, and social and cultural factors) for that individual\". The disadvantages \nexperienced by a person as a result of disability makes them handicapped.

    "explanation": "The web of causation for a disease suggests a number of ways to interrupt the disease \noccurrence/progression. This model was suggested by MacMahon and Pugh in their book ‘Epidemiologic Principles and \nMethods’. Web of causation considers all the predisposing factors and their complex interrelationship with \neach other. This model is ideally suited in the study of chronic disease. The web of causation does \nnot imply that the disease is controlled only when all the multiple chains of causation are \nremoved. Sometimes removal of one significant link is sufficient to control the disease. In a multifactorial event, individual factors are by no means of equal weightage. The importance \nof each factor is expressed in terms of relative risk.",

    "correct_answer": "c",
    "explanation": "Herd immunity aids the most in disease elimination. Herd immunity achieved, especially through immunization, goes a long way in helping the \nelimination of diseases. When a high level of herd immunity is maintained, the susceptible \npopulation is reduced to a small proportion, thereby eliminating the disease. The purpose of isolation is to protect the community by preventing the transfer of infection from \nthe reservoir to the possible susceptible hosts.
