Rehabilitation or recovery: It involves the restoration of the pre-disaster conditions by taking \nsteps such as: • Water supply • Basic sanitation and personal hygiene • Food safety • Vector control 3. Mitigation: Measures designed either to prevent hazards from causing disaster or to reduce the \neffects of the disaster. This also includes preparedness for any impending disasters or in \ndisaster-prone areas. 684 \nSold by @itachibot",
