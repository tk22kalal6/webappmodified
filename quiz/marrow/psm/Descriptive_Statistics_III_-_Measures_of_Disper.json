    "correct_answer": "a",
    "explanation": "68% of the population will lie between 180- 220. In a normal distribution curve, 68% of the values lie within the mean +/- 1 standard deviation and \nthe mean=median=mode. Since the mean = 200 and the standard deviation = 20: 68% of population will lie between Mean +/- 1SD, that is, 200 +/- 20 = 180-220 95% of population lies between Mean+/-2SD, 200+/- 2*20 = 160- 240 99% of population lies between Mean+/-3SD, 200+/- 3*20 = 140- 260 833 \nSold by @itachibot Descriptive Statistics IV - Measures of Position",
