    },
    "correct_answer": "a",
    "explanation": "Ticks are the most common reservoir of Q fever. Coxiella burnetii is the causative pathogen. The most commonly identified sources of human \ninfection are farm animals, such as cattle, goats, and sheep. Infected mammals shed C. burnetii in their urine, feces, milk, and placenta. Human exposure \nto C. burnetii may occur as a result of inhalation of contaminated aerosols arising from the \nplacenta or parturient fluids of infected livestock or from contaminated secretions on the surface \nof newborn animals. People working with farm animals and veterinarians are at a higher risk of infection.",
