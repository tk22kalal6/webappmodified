    "correct_answer": "b",
    "explanation": "Inferential statistics are those statistical methods that go further than just summarizing data. They involve inductive reasoning and using a statistic to estimate a parameter. E.g., the expected \nsuccess rate of vasectomy or mean blood pressure of all Indians. One of the most common problems faced in research is using information gathered by researching \na sample and then drawing conclusions about the population from which the sample is drawn. \nHere, sample statistics (sample mean and SD) are known and population parameters (population \nmean and SD) are unknown. Inferential statistical methods are used to draw conclusions about the population parameters from \nsample statistics.",
