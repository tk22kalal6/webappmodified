    },
    "correct_answer": "b",
    "explanation": "A host in which a parasite passes through its sexual stage of maturity is called the definitive host \nor primary host. A host in which a parasite exists in the larval or asexual form is called an intermediate host or \nsecondary host. A host which acts as the only source of development for a parasite is called the obligate host. Note: A host in which the organism remains alive but no development occurs is called a transport \nhost.",

    "correct_answer": "c",
    "explanation": "A disease that affects both humans and lower vertebrates and which can be transmitted in either \ndirection is classified as amphixenosis. E.g, Trypanosoma cruzi and Schistosoma japonicum. It is a type of zoonoses. Zoonoses are diseases that are transmitted between vertebrate animals \nand humans. Other types of zoonoses include: • Anthropozoonoses - infections that are transmitted to man from vertebrates. E.g., Rabies, plague \netc. • Zooanthroponoses - infections that are transmitted to vertebrates from humans. E.g., Human \ntuberculosis in cattle. Epizootic disease refers to an outbreak or epidemic of a disease in an animal population, often \nwith the implication that it may also affect human populations. Enzootic disease is an endemic \noccurring in animals. Note: Epornithic diseases are those diseases which are epidemic in bird populations. E.g., \nPsittacosis.",

    "correct_answer": "c",
    "explanation": "Disease 1- the cases have been almost the same so it has to be endemic. Disease 2- there is an alarming increase in the number of cases. It has to be an epidemic. Disease 3- the number of cases has decreased without any explanation so it has to be sporadic. Epidemic refers to the occurrence of a disease in excess of expected frequency. A pandemic is an epidemic affecting a large population over a large geographical area crossing \ninternational boundaries. An endemic disease is a regularly occurring disease in a population in expected frequency without \nany importation from outside. Sporadic diseases present as scattered cases of infection without relation temporally/spatially.",

    "correct_answer": "d",
    "explanation": "The disease in question belongs to the category of holoendemic diseases. In such diseases, a \nhigher prevalence and pathogenic response are seen among the children in an area. The adults \ntend to be either asymptomatic carriers or show reduced damage by the disease process. E.g, \nmalaria. 129 \nSold by @itachibot An endemic disease is a disease that is present constantly in a population or in a given area \nwithout importation from outside. E.g, kala-azar in Bihar. A hyperendemic disease is a disease that is constantly present at high incidence and prevalence \namong all groups in a population. E.g, dengue in India. A syndemic is the aggregation of two or more concurrent or sequential epidemics or disease \nclusters in a population with biological interactions, which exacerbate the prognosis and burden \nof disease. It is also known as a synergistic epidemic. Note: Quasiendemic is not a term used in infectious disease epidemiology.",

    "correct_answer": "c",
    "explanation": "Subclinical infection is not seen in measles. It always causes the development of overt signs and \nsymptoms. Subclinical infection refers to an inapparent, covert, missed or abortive case. The host harbours \nand sheds the infectious agent but does not develop signs and symptoms of the disease. Subclinical infections are seen in diseases like: • Hepatitis A • Diphtheria • Japanese encephalitis • Rubella Subclinical infections can only be detected by laboratory tests. They frequently occur during a \nperson’s lifetime and are responsible for the immunity shown by humans to a variety of \ndisease-producing microbes. Note: Subclinical cases should be differentiated from latent infections. In a latent infection, the \nhost does not shed the organism but it lies dormant without signs and symptoms.",

    "correct_answer": "a",
    "explanation": "The host does not shed the infectious organism in case of a latent infection. This is defined as a \nstate in which the host does not show signs and symptoms of the disease and does not shed the \norganism. It can be seen in conditions like herpes simplex, ancylostomiasis, infections due to slow viruses, \nBrill-Zinsser disease, etc. Subclinical infection is a state where the host harbours the infectious agent without developing \nsigns and symptoms but sheds the infectious agent. This state is seen in conditions like hepatitis \nA, rubella, mumps, etc. Healthy carriers are those who had subclinical infections and later developed a carrier state \nwithout suffering from the overt disease. This state is seen in: (mnemonic: CM - DPT) 130 \nSold by @itachibot • Cholera • Meningitis • Diphtheria • Polio • Typhoid Convalescent carriers are those which shed the infectious agent during the convalescent \nphase/recovery phase.

    "explanation": "The median incubation period is the time required for 50% of the cases to occur following \nexposure. The median incubation period of COVID-19 of approximately 5 days. Incubation period is the time interval between invasion of the infectious agent and the appearance \nof the first symptom or sign in the body. It is termed as the latent period in non-infectious \ndiseases. Incubation period depends upon: • Generation time of pathogen • Portal of entry • Infective dose • Individual susceptibility Incubation period is useful for : • Tracing the source of infection and contacts. • Determining the period of surveillance or quarantine. • Planning immunization. • Identification of point source or propagated epidemics. • Determining the prognosis. 131 \nSold by @itachibot",

    "correct_answer": "c",
    "explanation": "In the given scenario, the first child is the primary case and her classmates are the secondary \ncases. Hence, the interval between them developing the disease i.e., the intervening four days, is \ncalled the serial interval. The time interval between the onset of the primary case and the secondary case is called serial \ninterval. By collecting information about a whole series of such disease onsets, the distribution of the \nsecondary cases can be made. From this information, an approximation of the incubation period \ncan be done. Lead time/lead interval refers to the period between the first possible time of detection and the \nusual time of diagnosis. Incubatory interval/ incubation period refers to the time period between invasion of a pathogen to \nappearance of the first sign or symptom. Latent interval/ latent period refers to the period between disease initiation to detection of \nthe disease. It is usually used for non-infectious diseases and is equivalent to the incubation \nperiod. Note : • Primary case is the first case of a communicable disease introduced into a population unit. • Secondary case is one that develops after contact with the primary case. • Index case is the first case that comes to the notice of an investigator or physician.",

    "correct_answer": "d",
    "explanation": "The main reservoir of the coccobacilli belonging to the genus Brucella that cause brucellosis are \nanimals like sheep, cattle, horses, goats, whales, and dogs. A reservoir is the environment (e.g. soil, humans, animals, water, etc.) where the infectious agent \ngrows and multiplies (natural habitat) and from where it can be transmitted to a susceptible host. A source is an animal, object, human or substance which acts as an immediate mode \nof transmission and may or may not be a part of the reservoir. Option A: Coccidiomycosis is also called Valley fever and the causative fungi belong to the \nCoccidiodes. The main reservoir of this organism is soil. 132 \nSold by @itachibot Option B: Bacillus anthracis is a soil commensal and is also found on the hides and dried skins of \ninfected animals.
