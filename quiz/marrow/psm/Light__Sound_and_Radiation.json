    "explanation": "For good lighting in a room, ceilings and roofs must have an 80% reflection factor. The requirements of good lighting are: • Sufficient light to prevent eye strain. An illumination of 15 to 20-foot candles is accepted for \nsatisfactory vision. • Distribution of light must be uniform with the same intensity over the whole field of work • Absence of glare • Absence of sharp shadows 600 \nSold by @itachibot • The source of light should be constant and steady • The colour of light should approximate the colour of daylight • Ceilings and roofs must have an 80% reflection factor.

It has been observed that the human ear responds in a non-uniform way to different \nsound-pressure levels. A weighting curve, called curve A has been constructed which takes into \naccount the subjective effects of sound.

    "correct_answer": "b",
    "explanation": "The 10 days rule in radiation was related to pregnancy. It is aimed at preventing unintentional \nexposure of the embryo or fetus to radiation. This rule states that if a radiograph is being done on the abdomen or pelvis of a woman in her \nchildbearing age, then it should be done during the 10 days following the onset of menstruation. In most situations, there is growing evidence that strict adherence to the \"ten-day rule\" may be \nunnecessarily restrictive. Since organogenesis starts 3 to 5 weeks post-conception, it was felt that \nradiation exposure in early pregnancy couldn't result in malformation. Based on this, it was \nsuggested to do away with the 10-day rule and replace it with a 28-day rule. This means that \nradiological examination if justified, can be carried throughout the cycle until a period is missed. 607 \nSold by @itachibot Waste and Sewage Disposal",
