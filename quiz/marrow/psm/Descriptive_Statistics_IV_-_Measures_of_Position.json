    },
    "correct_answer": "b",
    "explanation": "Range is not a measure of position, it is a measure of dispersion or spread. The most common measures of position are quantiles, quartiles, centiles and z-scores (standard \nscores). Measures of position give the position of specific data in relation to other data in the set.",

    },
    "correct_answer": "b",
    "explanation": "Quantiles are elements in a distribution that divide data into equal groups. They are also known \nas fractiles. Median divides a distribution into two equal parts, so it is considered as a quantile. Quantiles are used for continuous, quantitative data. Quintiles are a type of quantile that divides data into 5 equal groups.",

    },
    "correct_answer": "c",
    "explanation": "Here, the 100th student will have the 40th percentile value for height. To arrive at this, we use the formula R = P/100 x (n + 1). where R is the rank of the desired observation, P is the quantile/percentile desired and n is the \nnumber of variables in the data. Thus, R = 40/100 x (250 + 1) = 0.4 x 251 = 100.4. This is rounded up to the closest number making R = 100.",

      "c": "9th decile",
      "d": "2nd quartile"
    },
    "correct_answer": "d",
    "explanation": "The 2nd quartile gives the central value of 180 elements. The central value of a distribution is \ngiven by the median. It divides the distribution into the ratio of 1:1. In quartiles elements of the distribution are divided into 4 equal parts by 3 values. Each part \ncontains a quarter, i.e., 25% of the values. So two quarters would give half of the values. So the \nelement present at the position of the 2nd quartile would be the central value, i.e., the median, \nwith half the values before and half the values after it. This is shown in the image given below. The 5th decile and 50th percentile represent the median values of a distribution in decile and \npercentile respectively.",
