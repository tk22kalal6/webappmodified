According to \nthe FAO/WHO 2007 guidelines, the recommended high-quality protein intake for adult men and \nwomen is 0.83 g/kg/day. This man weighs 60 kgs. Hence he requires around 50 g (0.83*60 = 49.8) \nof high-quality protein per day. Recommended high-quality protein intake by FAO/WHO: However, the mixed Indian diet does not meet the requirement for high-quality protein.

    "correct_answer": "d",
    "explanation": "482 \nSold by @itachibot The patient should be advised to eat whole grains since it has a low glycemic index (GI). GI is a number representing the relative ability of a carbohydrate food to increase the level of \nglucose in the blood. It is calculated by comparing the test carbohydrate to the standard (glucose \nor white bread). This measure has practical use in the management of diabetes and obesity. • Low GI foods – most fruits and vegetables, whole grains, pasta foods, beans, and lentils. • Moderate GI foods – sucrose, basmati rice, and brown rice. • High GI foods – corn flakes, baked potatoes, white bread, potatoes, watermelon, candies, and \nsyrupy foods.",
