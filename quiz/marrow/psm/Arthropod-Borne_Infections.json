Aedes mosquitoes become infective when they feed on infected patients from 1 day before onset of \nillness to the 5th day (viremia stage) of illness. After 8-10 days of extrinsic incubation of the virus \nin a mosquito, Aedes becomes infective and can transmit the infection. Higher \ntemperature results in shortening of the extrinsic incubation period, allowing mosquitoes to \nremain infectious for a longer duration.",
