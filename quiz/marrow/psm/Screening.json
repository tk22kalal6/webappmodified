    "explanation": "Lead time is the period between the first possible time of detection (point A) and the usual time of \ndiagnosis (point C). Screening time is the time difference between the first point of diagnosis and the critical point of \ndiagnosis. Diagnosis of a disease before the critical point has a good outcome and reduces the severity by \nreversing the disease process. Diagnosis beyond the critical point treatment would be unsuccessful \nand/or permanent damage would have occurred. Screening must be done in conditions where there is a considerable time lag between the onset of \ndisease and the usual time of diagnosis. That is conditions with a long lead time. Generation time is defined as the interval of time between the onset of infection by a host and \nthe maximal infectivity of that host.",

The false-positive rate is the number of false positives out of total non-diseased. ’alse-positive rate = 1-Specificity The false-positive rate is inversely proportional to specificity.
