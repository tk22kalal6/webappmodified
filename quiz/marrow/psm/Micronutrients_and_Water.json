    "explanation": "Gingelly (sesame) seeds have the highest content of thiamine. The thiamine content in various foods in decreasing order are as follows: • Gingelly seeds • Groundnut • Bengal gram • Whole wheat • Raw rice Thiamine is lost from rice during the process of milling. As it is a water-soluble vitamin, washing, \nand cooking rice cause further losses. Hence, it is advisable to avoid highly polished rice and eat \nparboiled or under-milled rice.",
