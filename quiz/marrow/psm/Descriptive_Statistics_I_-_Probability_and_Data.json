    "correct_answer": "a",
    "explanation": "794 \nSold by @itachibot A study to determine the mean height of children is an example of a descriptive statistical study. Descriptive statistics are the statistical methods that merely organize, describe or summarize the \nactual data available. For example, a study determining the mean blood pressure of patients \nvisiting a PHC on a single day. Analytical statistics are the second major category of epidemiological studies, after descriptive \nstatistics. The objective of an analytical study is to test the hypothesis. An observational study is an empiric investigation in which the objective is to establish a \nrelationship between cause and effect. It falls under the category of analytical statistics. It is performed when controlled experimentation cannot be feasibly used to determine a \nhypothesis. For example, in the case of cigarette smoking causing lung cancer, it would be \nunethical and not feasible to conduct a controlled experiment. So, an observational study is \npreferred. Inferential statistics involve inductive reasoning i.e., generalizing observations to a population \nafter having observed only a sample. An example of such a study would be a study determining \nthe expected success rate of vasectomy Theoretical statistics is a mathematical approach to describe something, predict events, or analyze \nthe relationship between things. Some of the concepts of theoretical statistics are mean, median, \nmode, standard deviation and correlation.",

    "correct_answer": "c",
    "explanation": "An element is a single observation in a study. For example, in a study of blood pressure values, \nthe blood pressure value of one person is an element. In a statistical study, the population refers to the group about which information is to be gathered. \nThe composition of the population in terms of its age, sex, occupation, cultural characters, etc \nneed to be defined before a study is conducted. The population need not consist of just people but \ncan also be made of measurements. For example, in a study of blood glucose measurements in \nIndians, the population consists of the blood glucose measurements. The part/subset of the population, which is being studied is known as a sample. For example, in a \nquestionnaire-based study on cervical cancer in a population, the sample would include females \nattending the out-patient departments of a hospital. This is a subset of the entire population. 795 \nSold by @itachibot",

The addition rule and multiplication rule can be used to calculate the probability of an event. The \naddition rule is used to calculate the combined probability of the occurrence of two or more \nmutually exclusive events. The multiplication rule is used to calculate the combined probability of \ntwo or more statistically independent events occurring together.

Binomial distribution helps determine the probability of occurance of a specific combination of \nmutually exclusive independent events. In a binomial distribution, there are only two possible \nevents like Yes/No or Male/Female or Alive/Dead. The results of the distribution gives the \nprobabilities of obtaining an exact number of successes in a series of independent trials. For example, the inheritence of cystic fibrosis follows a binomial distribution. There are: a. Two possible events - inheriting the disease/ not inheriting it b. Events are mutually exclusive - one person cannot both have the disease and not have it 796 \nSold by @itachibot c. Independent possibilities - if one child has inherited it, this will not affect if the other child will \ninherit it.

So, the probability of a person having anemia in the given population (p) = 20/100 = 0.2. If selecting 3 people from the population randomly, the chance of the first person having anemia \nis independent of the second or third person also having it and vice versa. This satisfies the \ncondition for the multiplication rule of probability which states that the probability of two or more \nstatistically independent events all occurring together is equal to the product of their individual \nprobabilities.
