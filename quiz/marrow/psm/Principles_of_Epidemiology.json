It is not the cause of death. Terminal events like circulatory failure and respiratory failure, are modes of dying.

    "explanation": "79 \nSold by @itachibot The type of study described is an ecological study as the unit of study is the population. The \nnumber of cigarette packets sold at the same time is data about the population. Option A: The unit of study in a cross-sectional study is an individual. Option C: There is no experiment done here. Hence, it is not experimental study. Option D: Quasi-experiments are nonrandomized, pre-post intervention studies done when it is \nnot feasible or ethical to conduct a randomized controlled trial. The unit of study is therefore \npatients or individuals and not population. 80 \nSold by @itachibot Descriptive Epidemiology",
