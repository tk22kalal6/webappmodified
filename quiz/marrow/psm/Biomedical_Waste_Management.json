    "explanation": "Radiological waste is not considered biomedical waste. Hence, deep burial is not done. Disposal of radiological is covered under the provisions of the Atomic Energy Act. The radiological \neffluents are incinerated in a dedicated incinerator having off-gas cleaning facility. Another \nmethod is to convert the organic base into an aqueous form by treating it with sodium hydroxide. Option A: Dead fetuses under the age of viability are considered human anatomical waste. \nAnatomical waste can be disposed of by deep burial in rural areas, where a common biomedical \ntreatment facility and incineration is not available.
