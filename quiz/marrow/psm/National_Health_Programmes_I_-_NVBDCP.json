They are used to detect the species of parasite. Microscopy is the best method for the diagnosis of malaria due to its high sensitivity and \nspecificity. Jaswant Singh Battacharya (JSB) stain is used for staining both thick and thin smears. Thick smear is used to detect infection and estimate parasite concentration. The correct thickness \nis the thickness through which a newsprint is barely visible. It is prepared by slow-drying for 30 \nminutes, which leads to hemolysis and distortion of the plasmodia morphology. Hence, species \ncannot be detected. Thin smear is used to identify the particular infecting species of Plasmodium. It is prepared by air \ndrying for 10 minutes and fixed in methanol. Thus, the plasmodia morphology is not distorted. 357 \nSold by @itachibot",

Thin blood smear is used to identify the particular infecting species. Thick blood smear is used to \ndetect infection and estimate parasite concentration. Antibody detecting Rapid Diagnostic Tests (RDTs) are not the method of choice anymore in \ndiagnosing malaria in inaccessible and tribal areas. The Antigen detecting RDTs and blood smear \nexamination are the recommended methods for diagnosis of malaria.

Antigenemia refers to the presence of adult filaria \nworms in the human body.
