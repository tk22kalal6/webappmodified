    "correct_answer": "b",
    "explanation": "Morbidity is not a demographic process. Demography refers to the study of the population. Demographic processes include: • Fertility • Mortality • Marriage • Migration • Social mobility These processes continuously bring about changes in the population size, composition, and \ndistribution.",

    "correct_answer": "b",
    "explanation": "The birth rate starts declining in stage 3 or the late expanding phase of the demographic cycle. India is currently in this stage of the demographic cycle. The year 1921 is called the year of the great divide in India. This is because, since 1921, the \nabsolute number of people getting added to the population during each decade has been on the \nrise. This is the year in which India moved from stage 1 to stage 2 of the demographic cycle.",

    "explanation": "In the given scenario, country A is in stage 2 and country B is in stage 4 of the demographic cycle. 423 \nSold by @itachibot According to the given data, in country A, the high birth rate has remained unchanged with a \ndecline in the death rate. This will result in an exponential increase in the population. This means \ncountry A is in the early expanding stage of the demographic cycle. In country B, the low birth rate and death rates have remained unchanged. Thus, the population \nwill attain a plateau phase and remain stationary. This means country B is in the low stationary \nstage of the demographic cycle.",

      "c": "Demographic gap is positive",
      "d": "Birth rate falls below death rate"
    },
    "correct_answer": "d",
    "explanation": "In stage 5 of the demographic cycle, the birth rate falls below the death rate. In this stage, the death rate attains a low stable rate while the birth rate keeps declining. Thus, the \ncurve of the birth rate will cross the curve of the death rate in a graph of the demographic cycle \nand falls further below. The demographic gap is negative and the population is declining. So, this stage is known as the \ndeclining stage.",

    },
    "correct_answer": "b",
    "explanation": "The demographic gap starts increasing in stage 2 and starts decreasing in stage 3. The demographic gap refers to the difference between birth rate and death rate which develops \nwhen a country undergoes a demographic transition. In stage 2 of the demographic cycle, the death rate declines but the birth rate remains unchanged. \nHence, the demographic gap increases and reaches a maximum by the end of stage 2. In stage 3, \nboth the death rate and birth rate are declining so the demographic gap starts decreasing.",

    },
    "correct_answer": "b",
    "explanation": "424 \nSold by @itachibot The marked stage is the late expanding phase (stage 3) of the demographic cycle. A \ndemographic gift or demographic dividend is seen in this stage. This refers to the presence of a higher number of economically productive individuals (young and \nmiddle-aged adults) in the population due to a higher birth rate in the previous demographic \nphase (phase 2). India is currently experiencing the demographic gift. The birth rate starts declining alongside a death rate that continues to fall in stage 3 causing a \ndecline in the demographic gap. The death rate declines further and the birth rate falls in this \nstage.",

    },
    "correct_answer": "a",
    "explanation": "The phenomenon of a demographic trap is seen maximally in the early expanding stage (stage 2). This phenomenon refers to a period in which there is high fertility and birth rate and a declining \ndeath rate. The population grows exponentially in this stage and this growing population exceeds \nthe national or regional carrying capacity. Countries in this stage are said to be caught in \na demographic trap.",

    "explanation": "In the given scenario, the current annual growth rate is 1.1%. Here, the birth rate is 42 i.e 42 live births per 1000 population, and the death rate is 31 i.e 31 \ndeaths per 1000 population. Current annual growth rate = crude birth rate – crude death rate. So, current annual growth rate = \n42-31= 11 per 1000 population or 1.1%.",

As per the Malthusian growth model, when the annual growth rate is 1%, the population doubles \nin 70 years. Therefore, when the annual growth rate is 2%, the population will double in 35 years.
