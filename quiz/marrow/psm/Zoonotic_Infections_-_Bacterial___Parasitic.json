    },
    "correct_answer": "c",
    "explanation": "Metazoonoses are a type of zoonoses where the infective agents are transmitted by invertebrate \nvectors. They multiply and develop within the invertebrates (extrinsic incubation period) before \ntransmission to a vertebrate host. A zoonosis is any disease or infection that is naturally transmissible from vertebrate animals to \nhumans. They can be classified based on their reservoir hosts into: • Anthropozoonoses - transmitted from lower vertebrates to man • Zooanthroponoses - transmitted from man to lower vertebrates • Amphixenoses - may be transmitted in either direction They can also be classified based on the life cycle of the infecting agent: Category \nMode \nExample Direct contact, fomites,mech \nanical vectorNo development \nal or propagative changes dur \ning transmission Direct zoonos \nes Rabies,brucellosis, trichinosi \ns Cyclo-zoonos \nes Humantaeniasis,Echinococco \nsis, Pentastomid infections Require> 1 vertebrate hostto \ncomplete the developmental \ncycle Arboviral infections, plaguea \nndschistosomiasis Meta-zoonose \ns Transmitted byinvertebrate v \nectorsInfective agentdevelops \nand multiplieswithin the inv \nertebrate (extrinsic incubatio \nn period) after which it is tra \nnsmitted to another vertebrat \ne host Has both avertebrate hostan \nd anon-animal(food, soil, pla \nnts) developmental site or res \nervoir Sapro-zoonos \nes Various forms oflarva migran \nsandmycoses",

    "explanation": "This clinical scenario and image showing buboes are suggestive of bubonic plague. It is \ntransmitted by the bite of the infected rat flea, Xenopsylla cheopis. Rodents, including rats, are \nthe reservoirs of infection. On the other hand, the pneumonic plague spreads from man to man by droplet infection. 295 \nSold by @itachibot",

    "correct_answer": "c",
    "explanation": "Endemic typhus is caused by the bite of an infective flea. This condition, also called murine typhus or flea-borne typhus, is caused by Rickettsia typhi. Rats \nserve as reservoirs. The incubation period is 1–2 weeks. The Weil Felix reaction is positive in \n2nd week. The drug of choice is tetracycline. Rodent control is most important and is best done by BHC and \nmalathion.",

    "correct_answer": "d",
    "explanation": "Rashes and local lesions are not a feature of Q-fever. It is caused by Coxiella burnetii. The mode of transmission is the inhalation of infected dust, entry \nthrough abrasions, or ingestion of contaminated milk. Rarely, ticks can be involved in \ntransmission. The incubation period is 2 to 3 weeks. The drug of choice is prolonged treatment with doxycycline. Pasteurization is advised to inactivate \nthe causative agent.",

    "correct_answer": "b",
    "explanation": "Both adult and nymphal stages of the mite are free-living in nature. They do not feed on the \nvertebral host. Scrub typhus is the most widespread rickettsial disease. It is caused by Orientia \ntsutsugamushi (previously known as Rickettsia tsutsugamushi) and transmitted by the bite of \ntrombiculid mite. The incubation period is 10-12 days. It presents with a typical eschar at the bite site. It is diagnosed by the Weil Felix reaction, which is \nstrongly positive with proteus strain OXK. It is treated by tetracyclines. 296 \nSold by @itachibot",

      "d": "Bedaquiline"
    },
    "correct_answer": "a",
    "explanation": "This clinical scenario is suggestive of visceral leishmaniasis. This patient should be managed with \nliposomal amphotericin B. This condition causes fever with rigor and chills associated with splenomegaly and hepatomegaly. \nThough lymphadenopathy is common in most endemic regions, it is rare in India. It is diagnosed by ELISA, indirect immunofluorescent antibody test (IFAT), and rk39 which \ndetects antibodies to Leishmania donovani. The treatment is as follows: • In most endemic regions: • Drug of choice - pentavalent antimonial (sodium stibogluconate or meglumine antimoniate) • If it fails or is unavailable - amphotericin B • In India and Mediterranian countries, the drug of choice is liposomal AmB. • Other drugs - paromomycin and miltefosine Option B: Fluconazole is an antifungal and is not useful in visceral leishmaniasis Option C: Linezolid is used in the treatment of MRSA and related infections. Option D: Bedaquiline is a newer anti-TB drug used in MDR-TB.",

    },
    "correct_answer": "a",
    "explanation": "Leishmania is an intracellular parasite in the macrophages. The vector is Phlebotomus (sandfly). Man is the reservoir in the Indian kala-azar. The incubation \nperiod is 10 days to 2 years, whereas the extrinsic incubation period is 4 to 25 days. The following \nconditions are caused by Leishmania: • Visceral leishmaniasis or kala-azar – L. donovani • Cutaneous leishmaniasis or oriental sore – L. tropica • Mucocutaneous leishmaniasis - L. braziliensis • Post-kala-azar dermal leishmaniasis - L. donovani 297 \nSold by @itachibot The image below is a microscopic image of the LD body. According to the NVBDCP, the management is as follows: • First-line - single-dose liposomal amphotericin B (10 mg/kg IV infusion) • Alternate - paromomycin + miltefosine for 10 days Monotherapy with antimonials (sodium stibogluconate) is no longer recommended due to \nresistance and toxicity. Synthetic pyrethroid is used for indoor residual spraying in all the \nendemic areas.",
