Patients also present with patchy \ndepigmentation on the legs called leopard skin. The presence of microfilaria in the eye causes photophobia and gradual loss of vision. The most \nsevere manifestations are sclerosing keratitis and chorioretinitis which can lead to blindness. Blackfly is also called Simulium.
