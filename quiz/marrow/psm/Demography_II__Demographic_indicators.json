    },
    "correct_answer": "d",
    "explanation": "Population under 15 years and above 65 years are part of the numerator used to calculate the total \ndependency ratio. This is because this population is considered the dependant population. The dependant population includes children below 15 years of age and adults above 65 years of \nage. The total dependency ratio is the ratio of the combined dependent population to those in the \nage group of 15 - 65 years. It is also called the societal dependency ratio. It can also be divided \ninto the young-age and old-age dependency ratios. 434 \nSold by @itachibot Note: As of mid-year 2020, the dependency ratio of India is 48.7%.",

    "explanation": "The total dependency ratio in this population is 66.6%. This can be calculated as follows. Here, the total population below 15 years of age is = 30% Total population above 65 years of age = 10% So, total population between 15-65 years of age = 100 - (30 + 10) = 60% Hence, dependency ratio in this population = 100* (30% + 10%)/60% = 66.6%",

    "correct_answer": "c",
    "explanation": "The expected number of pregnant females in the given community would be 165. Step 1: In the given question, the crude birth rate is 30 per 1000 people i.e 30 children are born \nfrom pregnant mothers for every 1000 people. Therefore there are 30 pregnant females per 1000 \npopulation. Step 2: Since the total population is 5000, the total no of pregnant females = 5000 x 30/1000 = \n150 Step 3: Since some pregnancies may not result in live births (abortions and stillbirths), a \ncorrection factor of 10% should be added to avoid the underestimation of the number of \npregnancies. Pregnancy wastage (i.e 10% of total live births) =10 x 150/100=15. Step 4: Total pregnant females = total live births + pregnancy wastage = 150+15=165.",
