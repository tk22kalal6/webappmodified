In order to estimate the presumptive coliform count, water to be tested is inoculated into tubes \ncontaining a suitable liquid medium. These tubes are then incubated and examined after an \nappropriate period of time. The test is called presumptive because the reaction observed in the \ntube may occasionally be due to other organisms. The proportion of false-positive reactions obtained depends both on the bacterial flora of the \nwater under examination and the medium used. Lactose broth, or MacConkey's broth, \nwith bromocresol purple as an indicator and a standardized concentration of bile salts incubated \nbetween 35°C–37°C for 48 hours, seems to be the most suitable media for presumptive tests.",
