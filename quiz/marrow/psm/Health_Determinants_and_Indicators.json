    },
    "correct_answer": "a",
    "explanation": "The biomedical concept of disease is based on the germ theory of disease, which was postulated by \nLouis Pasteur. The germ theory of disease states that microorganisms known as pathogens or germs can lead to \ndisease. It was criticized that it did not include environmental, social, psychological, and cultural \ndeterminants of health. The ecological concept of disease states that disease is the maladjustment of the human organism \nto the environment. The psychosocial concept of disease hypothesised that health is also influenced by social, \npsychological, cultural and economic factors as well. The holistic concept of disease includes all the above concepts to describe health. 33 \nSold by @itachibot",

Morbidity \nindicators can be used to measure the overall health and extent of healthcare utilisation in a given \npopulation. Disability is defined as public health outcomes related to health conditions that include \nlimitations in personal activities and societal participation. There are two types of disability \nindicators as follows: • Event type indicators- • Number of days of restricted activity • Bed disability days • Work loss days (or school loss days) within a specified period • Person type indicators- • Limitation of mobility: e.g confined to bed • Limitation of activity: e.g limitation to perform the basic activities of daily living such as eating \nand going to the toilet",

    "explanation": "HALE (Health Adjusted Life Expectancy) is an indicator that can be used to estimate the number \nof years a newborn is expected to live in full health based on the current rates of ill health and \nmortality. HALE is calculated using the life expectancy at birth with an adjustment for time spent in poor \nhealth. It captures both fatal and non-fatal health outcomes of average levels of population health. \nIt is also sensitive to changes over time or differences between countries in the distribution of \nhealth states. Sullivan's index is also known as disability-free life expectancy (DFLE) or active life expectancy. It \nis the average number of years an individual is expected to live free of disability if the current \npatterns of mortality and disability continue to apply. It doesn’t take into account premature \ndeath. As HALE includes not just disability but the larger definition of poor health, it is a better \noption with respect to the question. 34 \nSold by @itachibot",

    "explanation": "The proportional mortality rate is the simplest measure of estimating the burden of disease in the \ncommunity. It signifies the proportion of all deaths that can be attributed to the disease. It is calculated as follows: Proportional mortality rate of a disease = (No. of deaths due to that disease in the year/ Total no. \nof deaths in the year) *100. Option A: Case fatality rate measures the risk of persons dying from a certain disease within a \ngiven time period. It measures the killing power of a disease. It is used to link mortality to \nmorbidity. Option B: Incidence measures the rate at which new cases are occurring in a population. It is not \ninfluenced by the duration of the disease. The use of incidence is generally restricted to acute \ndiseases. Option C: Crude death rate is considered a fair indicator of the comparative health of the people. \nIt is the rate of total deaths in a year compared to the mid-year population.",

It is also the best measure of the effectiveness of interventions. DALY is calculated as - Years of lost life prematurely (YLL) + Years lost to disability (YLD). It can \nmeasure both mortality and disability together. As DALY is affected by premature loss of life, conditions that affect younger individuals like road \ntraffic accidents have a high DALY. In comparison to this, Alzheimer's disease has a lower DALY \nas it is a disease that mostly develops during old age and so has a lower YLL.",

It reflects our social values, attitudes, and activities. It is \ncomposed of: • Cultural patterns (daily nutrition, superstitions) • Behavioral patterns (personal hygiene, sedentary life) • Lifelong personal habits (e.g. smoking, alcoholism) Lifestyle is learned by social interaction with parents, siblings, friends, school, and mass media. Our political system determines our health. It can help shape community health services with \nregards to resource allocation, manpower policy, choice of technology, and the degree to which \nthese services are made available &amp; accessible to all segments of the society. The percentage of GDP spent on health is an indicator of political commitment. WHO \nrecommends at least 5% of GDP to be spent on health care.

    "explanation": "The provision of free health camps by the government is a concept of state medicine. Health does not merely mean the absence of disease or provision of diagnostic, curative, and \npreventive services. It is a state of physical, mental, and social well-being. The state of positive health is based on the idea of perfect functioning of the body and mind. \nAccording to this concept, health is: • Biologically a state in which every cell and organ in the body is functioning at optimum capacity • Psychologically a state in which the individual feels a sense of perfect well-being and mastery \nover his environment 37 \nSold by @itachibot • Socially a state in which the individual's capacities for participation in the social system are \noptimal This concept is too idealistic and can never become a reality. Humans can never be so perfectly \nadapted to the environment because everything in our life is subject to change. As the goal of positive health is unattainable, a broader concept of improving the quality of life \nhas emerged.
