    "explanation": "The period marked 3 in the figure is the incubation period while the later part of the period \nrepresents subclinical infection. Rabies is not communicable during its incubation period as it is \ntransmitted from the saliva of a rabid animal through bite or scratch. An incubatory carrier state is one in which carriers shed the organism during the incubation \nperiod of the disease, especially during the later parts of it. Examples of diseases showing incubatory carrier state are: • Measles • Polio • Mumps • Whooping cough • Diphtheria • Influenza • Hepatitis A Carriers of a disease are classified by the following: • Type: Incubatory, convalescent or healthy. • Duration: Temporary or chronic. • Portal of exit: Urinary, respiratory, intestinal or others. 140 \nSold by @itachibot",

    "correct_answer": "c",
    "explanation": "Chronic carriers are those who shed or excrete the organism for indefinite periods. Carriers are classified into chronic carriers and temporary carriers based on the duration. Organisms may be shed continuously or intermittently in chronic carriers. The duration of the \ncarrier state also depends on the disease. Chronic carrier state is seen in typhoid, hepatitis B, \ngonorrhea, malaria, etc. Temporary carriers are classified into: • Incubatory carriers - Those that shed the organism during the incubation period of the disease, \nespecially during the later parts of it. It is seen in measles, mumps, polio, etc. • Healthy carriers - Those who suffer from subclinical infections and develop a carrier state \nwithout developing the overt disease. It is seen in polio, meningococcal meningitis, cholera, \ndiphtheria, etc. • Convalescent carriers - Those that shed the organism during recovery or convalescence. It is seen \nin typhoid. Paradoxical carrier refers to a carrier who acquires the pathogen from another carrier. Note: Pseudo-carriers are carriers of avirulent organisms.",

    "explanation": "Tetanus does not show vertical or transplacental transmission. Transmission of diseases or non-infectious agents transplacentally is called vertical transmission. \nDiseases that show this type of transmission include: 141 \nSold by @itachibot • Herpes • HIV • Rubella • Varicella Apart from diseases, non-infectious agents like lithium, thalidomide, stilbestrol, etc. can cross the \nplacenta and lead to the development of congenital anomalies in a foetus. Note: Neonatal tetanus occurs as a result of the failure to use aseptic techniques in managing the \numbilical stump, unclean hands, and instruments or contamination by dirt, straw, or other \nnonsterile materials in the delivery field. Immunisation of pregnant women can prevent this \ndisease via the transplacental transport of immunoglobulins.",

    "correct_answer": "a",
    "explanation": "Droplet nuclei can travel as far as 6 feet, whereas a droplet (particle &gt; 5m) travels \n&lt;30-60cm, as recent studies have shown. Droplets are a mode of direct transmission of infectious agents. They are formed from saliva and \nnasopharyngeal secretions released during coughing, sneezing, or speaking into the surrounding \natmosphere. The expelled droplets may impinge directly upon the conjunctiva, oro-respiratory \nmucosa or skin of close contact. This mode of transmission is seen in common cold, diphtheria, \netc. Proper basic ventilation and prevention of overcrowding reduce the potential for this type of \ntransmission.",

    "explanation": "Droplet nuclei are sized less than or equal to 5 microns. They may be formed by evaporation of droplets coughed or sneezed into the air or be generated \npurposefully by a variety of atomizing devices (aerosols). They are capable of indirect airborne \ntransmission of diseases like tuberculosis, influenza, chickenpox, measles, etc. The droplet nuclei may remain airborne for long periods of time, some retaining and others losing \ninfectivity or virulence.

    "correct_answer": "c",
    "explanation": "Airborne transmission by droplet nuclei is not a method of direct transmission of diseases. It is a method of indirect transmission of diseases. 142 \nSold by @itachibot Droplet nuclei are tiny particles of size 1-5 microns range that may be formed by either due to \nevaporation of droplets coughed or sneezed into the air or are formed from aerosols. These droplet nuclei remain airborne for long periods of time and can transmit diseases like \ntuberculosis, influenza, chickenpox, measles, Q fever and other respiratory infections. Droplet transmission, vertical transmission, and contact with soil are methods of \ndirect transmission of diseases. Differences between droplet and droplet nuclei are summarised below: DROPLET NUCLEI \nDROPLET Indirect transmission \nDirect transmission It is produced while coughing, It is the residue from evapora \nted droplets sneezing, talking <5microns in diameter \n5 microns in diameter No need for close contact for \ntransmission Requires closeness and direct contact for transmission Diseases transmitted: chicke \nnpox, measles etc. Diseases transmitted: diphth \neria, meningococcal meningit \nis etc.",

    "correct_answer": "d",
    "explanation": "The spread of a disease through contaminated food is an example of vehicle-borne transmission. \nIt is an indirect mode of transmission. Vehicle-borne transmission is the transmission of infectious agents through food, water and \nbiological products (blood, plasma etc.). Of these, food and water are more frequent vehicles of \ntransmission because they are used by everyone.

    "explanation": "Fomites are objects other than water or food that can be contaminated by infectious agents and \nhelp in transmitting the disease. They include clothes, towels, linen, cups, plates, spoons, etc. Fomites are an example of an indirect mode of transmission. Some diseases transmitted by fomites include diphtheria, typhoid, hepatitis A, etc. Good public and personal hygiene can prevent this type of transmission. 143 \nSold by @itachibot",

    "explanation": "The lodgement and development of an arthropod on the body surface is called infestation. Infection is the entry and development or multiplication of an infectious agent in a host’s body. Contamination is the presence of a disease agent on a body surface like clothes, toys, etc. and also \nin substances like food or water. Colonization is the presence of a disease agent in or on a host, with growth and multiplication but \nwithout any overt clinical expression or detected immune response in the host at the time it is \nisolated.",

Cyclo-developmental transmission is a transmission where the agent undergoes only \ndevelopmental changes and not multiplication within the vector.
