The given study is statistically significant (p-value = 0.01) with a strong positive correlation (r = \n+0.90) between systolic BP and cholesterol levels. Thus, it is likely that patients with high systolic \nBP will have high cholesterol levels and those with low BP will have low cholesterol levels. The coefficient of determination (r2)here is 0.9 x 0.9 = 0.81. This indicates that around 80% of \nthe variation in systolic BP among the patients can be explained by serum cholesterol levels.",

It is known that low economic status is associated with a high infant mortality rate. This indicates \na negative correlation. However, the infant mortality rate is also influenced by other factors, \nindicating a moderate correlation (not equal to 1). This makes -0.8 the most likely value of \ncorrelation.",
