Rehabilitation has been defined as the use of medical, social, educational, and vocational \nmeasures for training the individual to the highest possible level of functional ability. Like \nproviding calipers for walking to patients and arranging schooling after being affected by polio. Immunization drives are examples of specific protection.",

      "d": "Soup with 3g/litre salt added to it"
    },
    "correct_answer": "b",
    "explanation": "Salted water in which cereal has been cooked can be given to a child with diarrhoea. If the WHO ORS mixture is not available, a simple mixture of 1 teaspoon of salt and 6 teaspoons \nof sugar must be dissolved in 1 L of drinking water and given to the child. Fluids that do not contain salt in water, for eg: rice water, unsalted soup, yoghurt drinks, green \ncoconut water, etc, must not be given. 3g/litre of salt must be added to such drinks before giving it \nto the child with diarrhoea. The infant's usual diet of cereals, vegetables and other foods should be continued and never be \ndiluted. The child should be given as much nutrient-rich food as acceptable. Avoid the following: • Sweetened drinks with sugar, like commercial fruit juices and sweetened tea, as they lead to \nosmotic diarrhoea and hypernatremia. • Fluids with a stimulant and purgative effect like coffee and medicinal tea infusions.",

Hence, it \ncannot be a criterion for continuous examination. The initial rehydration must be fast until an easily palpable pulse is present. Reassess the patient \nevery 1-2 hours. After 1-2 liters of fluid have been infused, the drip should be slowed down till the blood pressure \nand pulse return to normal. Rehydration must be continued otherwise till all signs of dehydration \nhave disappeared. ORS should be given when the patient can drink oral fluids.

Intravenous rehydration: Used for initial rehydration for patients in shock or those who are \nunable to drink. • Ringer's lactate solution/Hartmann's solution - Used for injection. Best commercially available \nsolution. • Diarrhea treatment solution- Recommended as an ideal polyelectrolyte solution for intravenous \ninfusion. • Normal saline- Used if nothing else is available.
