Varicella-zoster localized in the patient with an intact immune system with a lesion that can be \ncontained/covered do not require droplet precaution. Disseminated varicella in any patient \nrequires airborne and contact precautions. Diphtheria, pertussis, and mycoplasma are transmitted by droplets and hence require droplet \nprecaution and isolation. Although patients are not contagious starting 48 hours after antibiotic therapy, droplet \nprecautions are typically maintained until the completion of the antibiotic course and are \nculture-negative on two cultures taken 24 hours apart. Droplet precautions include the use of \nmasks, gowns, gloves and protective eye gear when providing direct patient care.",

S. pneumoniae is an encapsulated organism that is detected by the spleen and is removed. \nHowever, in sickle cell disease, the sickled cells block the vessels in the spleen which results in \nsplenic infarction.

In TST, 0.1 ml of PPD (purified protein derivative) containing 5 TU (tuberculosis unit) is injected \nintradermally and induration is read after 48-72 hours. An induration of 10 mm or more is \nconsidered positive in patients from countries with a high prevalence of tuberculosis. Surrounding \nerythema is not considered. A positive tuberculin test indicates hypersensitivity to tuberculoprotein, denoting either latent \ninfection with tubercle bacilli, or BCG immunization, or recent or past infection with or without \nclinical disease. False positives may be seen in infections with related mycobacteria and false negatives in miliary \ntuberculosis, severely immunosuppressed states, etc.",

Identification of all positives to the tuberculin test is a marker of the prevalence of \ntuberculosis. Tuberculin conversion refers to the situation where an individual’s tuberculin skin test (TST) \nresults in changes from negative (0–4 mm diameter induration) to positive (equal to or &gt;10 mm \ndiameter induration) within a 24-month period.

This helps in the early detection and treatment of drug-resistant TB. This has been \nintegrated into the regular TB services to detect rifampicin resistance at the time of diagnosis. \nDepending on the sensitivity of the tubercle bacilli, appropriate ATT is started.
