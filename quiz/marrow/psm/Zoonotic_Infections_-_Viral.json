The virus rarely grows in culture. The case \nfatality rate varies between 20-40%. There are 3 types of JE vaccines available: • Nakayama or Beijing strain - purified inactivated vaccine • Beijing P-3 strain - inactivated vaccine • SA-14-14-2 - live attenuated vaccine Note: Killed JE vaccines (Inactivated SA 14-14-2 cell culture-derived and inactivated Vero cell \nculture-derived) are gradually replacing live attenuated vaccines.
