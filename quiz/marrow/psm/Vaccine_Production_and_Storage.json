    "correct_answer": "d",
    "explanation": "Formaldehyde is not used in the BCG vaccine. It is used in IPV and diphtheria and tetanus \nvaccines. Excipients (other vaccine constituents) include: Adjuvants: serve to enhance the immune reaction \nto the vaccine , Stabilizers : stabilize and prolong the shelf-life of the vaccine and Preservatives : preserve the components. Some examples are listed below: • As stabilizing agents- • MgCl2 - OPV • MgSO4 - measles • Lactose-sorbitol and sorbitol-gelatine 168 \nSold by @itachibot • To prevent microbial growth and contamination- • Thiomersal- DPT, hepatitis B, Haemophilus influenzae type b (Hib), rabies, influenza, and \nmeningococcal diseases. It contains very small amounts of organic mercury. • Neomycin- MMR and IPV • Other preservatives- • 2-phenoxyethanol - IPV • Phenol - Typhoid vaccine",

    "correct_answer": "c",
    "explanation": "Side effects are rare with the use of adjuvants in vaccines. Adjuvants are substances that are added to vaccines to enhance their immunogenicity by degree \nand/or duration. They help in the reduction of the amount of immunogen in vaccines or in the \nnumber of doses required to achieve immunity. Aluminium salts are the most commonly used adjuvants. Adjuvants are used in many vaccines like: • Anthrax vaccine • Hep A vaccine • Hep B vaccine • çapanese encephalitis vaccine • DT and DTaP • HPV vaccine • Pneumococcal vaccine",

    "explanation": "The image shown in the question is of an ice-lined refrigerator (ILR). Dial or digital thermometers \nare used to record temperatures inside an ice-lined refrigerator. ILRs are the main method of vaccine storage in primary health centers. They are an important \npart of the cold chain and they maintain a temperature of 2 to 8 °C for the storage of vaccines. They have different temperature zones for different vaccines. The upper zone is for \nfreeze-sensitive vaccines like cholera, hep B, rotavirus(liquid), etc while the lower zone is for \nheat-sensitive vaccines like OPV, measles, etc. All vaccines are kept in the basket provided with ILR.
