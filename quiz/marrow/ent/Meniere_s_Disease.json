      "explanation": "Ménière’s disease is also called endolymphatic hydrops. It is a disorder of the inner ear where the endolymphatic system is distended with \nendolymph. This occurs due either due to excessive production or faulty absorption of \nendolymph. It has 2 variants: • Cochlear hydrops - the main feature is hearing loss. Vertigo is absent. • Vestibular hydrops - repeated episodes of vertigo without loss of hearing.",

Ideal \ncandidates have no functional hearing and have failed more conservative treatments, such as \ngentamicin injection. Despite this morbidity, labyrinthectomy has the highest rate of vertigo \ncontrol (&gt;95%), more than vestibular neurectomy (78-90%), and is considered the single \ndefinitive treatment. The step-by-step management approach for Ménière's disease consists of dietary modifications \nand vestibular suppressants as the initial measures, followed by intratympanic gentamicin \nablation, and finally, surgical intervention. Primarily, the management of Menier's disease involves a sodium restricted diet and diuretics like \nacetazolamide (Option A). They are more useful for short-term control. Gentamicin (Option D) is a selective vestibulotoxic aminoglycoside antibiotic that is preferentially \ntaken up by type I hair cells. It is opted for only if dietary modifications and vestibular \nsuppressants have failed to control the symptoms. If used judiciously, hearing is preserved. The options for surgical management include - Endolymphatic sac surgery, vestibular \nneurectomy, and labyrinthectomy. Endolymphatic sac surgery is currently declining in popularity \ndue to lack of evidence of vertigo control. 182 \nSold by @itachibot Vestibular neurectomy (Option C) refers to selective ablation of the vestibular nerve.

      "correct_answer": "c",
      "explanation": "Sensorineural hearing loss is not seen in superior semicircular canal dehiscence syndrome \n(SSCDS). They may experience mild to moderate hearing conductive loss. Conductive hearing loss is due to the abnormal transmission and dissipation of acoustic energy \nthrough the defect (third window), leading to reduced conduction to the cochlea for lower \nfrequencies. This can manifest as a low-frequency air-bone gap at multiple frequencies. There is \nno defect in the cochlea or the auditory pathway. Superior semicircular canal dehiscence (SSCD) is a condition in which bone between the apex of \nthe superior semicircular canal and the middle cranial fossa is absent. This causes endolymph in \nthe labyrinthine system to move with sound or pressure, causing an activation of the vestibular \nsystem. Patients may have vestibular symptoms like vertigo triggered by loud sounds (Tullio \nphenomenon)or pressure such as coughing and can also experience hyperacusis for \nbone-conducted sounds. They may perceive the sounds of their own eye movements or footsteps \nin the affected ear. The patients may exhibit nystagmus when exposed to loud sounds or during the Valsalva \nmaneuver or pressure in the ear canal (positive fistula test). The direction of the nystagmus aligns \nwith the affected superior semicircular canal, and some patients may tilt their heads in the plane \nof the affected superior semicircular canal in response to loud sounds. Noncontrast HRCT of the temporal bone can demonstrate the defect. The click-evoked VEMP \n(vestibular evoked myogenic potential) response and vestibuloocular reflex are pronounced in \nSSCD patients, in which the evoked eye movements align with the affected superior canal. For mild symptoms, avoidance of triggers is recommended. In case of severe disabling symptoms, \nsurgical resurfacing of the superior semicircular canal or plugging of the superior semicircular \ncanal may be attempted.",

BPPV is one of the common causes of recurrent vertigo, and the episodes are brief (&lt;1min) and \nare always provoked by changes in head position. The attacks are caused by free-floating calcium \ncarbonate crystals usually dislodged from the posterior canal. A positive Dix-Hallpike maneuver confirms the diagnosis of BPPV. In this maneuver, the patient \nbegins sitting up with their head turned 45 degrees toward the ear to be tested.

      "explanation": "The given clinical scenario is suggestive of benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV). The \ndiagnostic maneuver used in BPPV is the Dix-Hallpike maneuver, the gold standard for \ndiagnosing BPPV. The therapeutic maneuver is Epley's maneuver. BPPV is one of the common causes of recurrent vertigo, and the episodes are brief (&lt;1min) and \nare always provoked by changes in head position. The attacks are caused by free-floating calcium \ncarbonate crystals usually dislodged from the posterior canal. A patient presenting with vertigo should be evaluated for ruling out the central lesions (like a \ntumor in the fourth ventricle, multiple sclerosis, etc) before confirming the diagnosis of BPPV. \nDix-Hallpike maneuver helps rule out central lesions and also diagnose BPPV. Dix-Hallpike maneuver: • The maneuver starts with the patient in a sitting position. • Their head is turned 45 degrees towards the ear to be tested. • The examiner quickly brings the patient to a supine position with their head 30 degrees below \nthe horizontal. • The 45-degree head rotation is maintained during the procedure. • Now the examiner observes the patient for nystagmus. 184 \nSold by @itachibot 185 \nSold by @itachibot Tumors of Ear",
