Acute retropharyngeal abscess is commonly seen in children below 3 years. It is the result of \nsuppuration of retropharyngeal lymph nodes secondary to infection in the adenoids, nasopharynx, \nposterior nasal sinuses, or nasal cavity. In adults, it may result from penetrating injury of the posterior pharyngeal wall or cervical \nesophagus. Clinical features of a retropharyngeal abscess include • Dysphagia and difficulty in breathing - as the abscess obstructs the air and food passages. • Stridor and croupy cough • Torticollis - the neck becomes stiff and the head is kept extended. • A bulge in the posterior pharyngeal wall, usually seen on one side of the midline. Chronic retropharyngeal abscess is the result of • Caries of the cervical spine • Tuberculous infection of retropharyngeal lymph nodes secondary to tuberculosis of deep cervical \nnodes.",

Infection can spread to the parapharyngeal \nspace from any of the other deep neck spaces - peritonsillar, retropharyngeal and submandibular \nspaces. It commonly spreads from a dental infection, tonsillitis or peritonsillar abscesses. The \npatient is usually systemically unwell, with severe trismus and possibly airway compromise. Initial broad-spectrum intravenous antibiotics should include cover against streptococci and \nanaerobic organisms. Carotid sheath vessel thrombosis, necrotizing fasciitis and mediastinitis are some of the \ncomplications. Marked neck swelling, airway compromise, and male gender appear to be predictive of higher-risk \ncases.",

      },
      "correct_answer": "a",
      "explanation": "Trismus is not a feature of infection of the post-styloid compartment of the parapharyngeal space. \nTrismus is seen in pre-styloid abscess due to the involvement of medial pterygoid muscle. Parapharyngeal space is divided into two compartments by the styloid process and its \nattachments. Clinical features depend on the compartment involved. In a post-styloid abscess, there is a bulge of the pharynx behind the posterior pillar, accompanied \nby paralysis of cranial nerves IX, X (resulting in vocal cord paralysis), XI, XII, and the sympathetic \nchain, which can manifest as Horner's syndrome. Swelling in the parotid region may also be \npresent. Notably, trismus, the inability to fully open the mouth, is usually absent in this type of \nabscess. A pre-styloid abscess exhibits distinct features including the prolapse of the tonsil and tonsillar \nfossa, along with trismus caused by the spasm of the medial pterygoid muscle. Marked \nodynophagia is common. Additionally, an external swelling can be observed behind the angle of \nthe jaw. Fever, sore throat, torticollis (caused by spasm of the prevertebral muscles), and signs of systemic \ntoxicity are common features. Diagnosis can be established using a contrast-enhanced CT scan (CECT). If there is suspicion of \nthrombosis of the internal jugular vein or an aneurysm of the internal carotid artery, magnetic \nresonance arteriography (MRA) can be useful. Patients require intravenous antibiotic therapy with amoxicillin-clavulanic acid, carbapenem \nantibiotics plus drugs that target anaerobic organisms, such as clindamycin or metronidazole. A \nparapharyngeal abscess is drained by an external horizontal incision made on the skin a few \ncentimeters below the angle of the mandible.

      },
      "correct_answer": "b",
      "explanation": "An intraoral incision is not sufficient in the case of option B - parapharyngeal abscess. An external \nneck incision must be made always to ensure complete drainage of the abscess. Option A- This is a case of quinsy as the child has odynophagia and a hot potato voice. Option B - This is a case of parapharyngeal abscess as the swelling is in the upper 1/3rd of the \nneck and the tonsil of the same side is pushed medially Option C- This is a case of retropharyngeal abscess since there is fever and swelling in the \nposterior pharyngeal wall lateral to the midline. Option D- This is a case of Sublingual abscess involving the sublingual space which is caused by \npenetrating injuries of oral mucosa due to fishbone or wood splinters. Indications for Incision and Drainage: • Sublingual abscess: Always intraoral incision • Parapharyngeal abscess: Always external neck incision. • Peritonsillar abscess: Always intraoral. • Retropharyngeal abscess: • Intraoral - in rose position • External - Dean approach • Ludwig’s angina: • Intraoral—if the infection is still localized to sublingual space. • External—if the infection involves submaxillary space. 491 \nSold by @itachibot",

The oral cavity shows congested and edematous tonsil and \ntonsillar pillars with edematous uvula pushed to the opposite side. These findings are highly \nsuggestive of quinsy (peritonsillar abscess). It is the collection of pus in the peritonsillar space between the fibrous capsule of the tonsil and \nthe superior constrictor muscles of the pharynx. Both aerobic and anaerobic organisms are seen. Patient presents with fever, unilateral throat pain, odynophagia, hot potato voice, torticollis, foul \nbreath, referred otalgia through glossopharyngeal nerve and trismus due to spasm of pterygoid \nmuscles. Oral cavity examination may show congested and edematous tonsils, pillars, and soft palate on the \ninvolved side. Edematous uvula pushed to the opposite side. Pus may be seen on the tonsillar \nregion. Jugulodigastric lymph nodes may be enlarged. The management of quinsy is by antibiotics and incision and drainage to drain the abscess \nfollowed by interval tonsillectomy 4 to 6 weeks later. Rare complications seen are parapharyngeal abscess, edema of the larynx, septicemia, lung \nabscess, or jugular vein thrombosis. Other options: Option A: Pharyngitis presents with fever, throat pain, enlarged tonsils, and lymphoid follicles on \nthe posterior pharyngeal wall. Option B: Parotid abscess occurs due to the suppuration of parotid space. It presents with \nswelling, redness, firmness, and tenderness in the parotid area and at the angle of the mandible. It \nis usually unilateral, but bilateral abscesses can occur. Due to the thick capsule, fluctuation is \noften difficult to elicit. Option C: Bezold abscess is a complication of acute otomastoiditis where the infection/pus breaks \nthrough the thin medial side of the tip of the mastoid and presents as a swelling in the upper part \nof the neck.",

A parotid abscess refers to an infection and pus formation in the parotid space. It is caused most \ncommonly by Staphylococcus aureus. Post-surgical cases and debilitated patients with stasis of \nsalivary flow are at risk of developing parotid abscesses. Patients typically present with unilateral swelling, redness, induration, and tenderness over the \nparotid gland and angle of the mandible. Dehydration and fever are also present. Diagnosis is by \nultrasonography or a CT scan. Multiple small loculi of pus are seen in the parenchyma.
