Sebaceous cysts are the retention cysts of the sebaceous gland that are usually present on the face, \nscalp, or scrotum. They contain yellowish-white cheesy material with fat and epithelium. Clinical features: • The swelling is painless, soft, and freely mobile. • Though non-transilluminating, they are Paget's test positive (fluctuant). • Punctum is seen in 70% of the patients with sebaceous cysts. They are dark in color due to the \naccumulation of denuded epithelium. • They also have an unpleasant sebum odor. • The swelling can ulcerate and become painful (Cock’s peculiar tumor). • Some cysts over the scalp may also harden over time (Sebaceous horn). • Many may get infected and lead to abscess formation. Treatment: • Excision including skin adjacent to punctum using elliptical incision-dissection method. • Incision and avulsion of cyst wall. • In the presence of an abscess, an initial treatment with an incision later followed by excision of \nthe cyst Other options: Option A: Dermoid cysts present as firm painless subcutaneous nodules and are of 4 types: • Sequestration dermoid - sequestration of epithelium during embryological development • Tubulodermoid - accumulation of secretions from ectodermal tube/duct • Implantation dermoid - implantation of the epidermis due to trauma • Teratomatous dermoid - having all 3 germ layers (ecto, meso, and endoderm) Option C: Meningiomas are benign tumors arising from the meningothelial cells of the dura. They \npresent with headaches, seizures, or focal neurological deficits. Option D: Postauricular cutaneous mastoid fistula is a rare complication of chronic otitis media \nthat heals very slowly and needs surgical closure. 195 \nSold by @itachibot",

      "explanation": "Hitzelberger’s sign is the sign elicited in the given clinical scenario of acoustic neuroma. Hitzelberger’s sign is the hypoaesthesia of the posterior meatal wall because the tumor has \naffected the sensory fibers of the facial nerve. In this case, sensory fibers of the facial nerve are \naffected, as the patient has decreased lacrimation and loss of taste. Motor fibers are more \nresistant and are affected late. A delayed blink reflex may be an early manifestation.",

      "explanation": "Rollover phenomenon is diagnostic of acoustic neuroma. It is a feature of retro-cochlear/neural \nlesions wherein the speech discrimination steadily increases with intensity but suddenly drops \nsignificantly beyond a particular intensity of sound. Meniere’s disease is an important differential for acoustic neuroma as the patients suffer from \nsimilar symptoms. Meniere’s is a cochlear pathology and acoustic neuroma is retrocochlear. Option A - Stapedial reflex is present in cochlear lesions (Meniere’s) and absent in retrocochlear \nlesion (acoustic neuroma) Option B - Recruitment phenomenon is the abnormal growth in loudness in the affected ear, seen \nin cochlear pathologies. 203 \nSold by @itachibot Option C - SISI (short increment sensitivity score) is a test of intensity discrimination which is \nvery high in cochlear pathologies but low in retro-cochlear.",
