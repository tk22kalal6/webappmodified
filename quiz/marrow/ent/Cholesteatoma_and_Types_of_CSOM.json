Various kinds of epithelia lining the middle ear are: • Ciliated columnar- around the eustachian tube opening (Protympanum) • Pavement like- attic/epitympanum • Cuboidal- rest",

This along with clinical scenario is suggestive of \ncholesteatoma which is also known as epidermosis or keratoma Cholesteatoma is the presence of stratified squamous epithelium in middle ear where it is not \nusually present, i.e., skin in wrong place. A central white mass, consisting of keratin debris is produced by the matrix. For this reason, it \nhas also been named epidermosis or keratoma. The term cholesteatoma is a misnomer because it neither contains cholesterol crystals nor it is a \ntumor to merit the suffix “oma.”",
