      "correct_answer": "c",
      "explanation": "The 1st and 2nd branchial arches give rise to the pinna (auricle) through six mesenchymal \nproliferation. These proliferations are called auricular hillocks and they fuse to form the auricle. The tissue from the second arch forms nearly all of the pinna. The tissue from the first arch forms the tragus and external auditory meatus. Image showing the development of pinna: 8 \nSold by @itachibot",

      "correct_answer": "b",
      "explanation": "The given image showing the presence of sinus seen between the tragus and crus of the helix is \nsuggestive of the preauricular sinus. It is due to improper fusion of the auricular tubercle formed \nfrom the first and second arches. The preauricular sinus is apparent at birth and is usually bilateral. There may be occasional \nsebaceous discharge from the punctum. It does not regress spontaneously.",

      },
      "correct_answer": "c",
      "explanation": "Reconstructive surgeries for congenital malformations of the pinna (auricle) are usually \nperformed around 5 or 6 years of age. Autologous cartilages from ribs are harvested for these \npurposes and the ideal timing is between 6-10 years. At around 3 years of age, 85% of the auricular growth is complete and the cartilaginous growth is \nalmost complete by 5 years. Surgery performed on the auricle after 5 years doesn't hinder further \ngrowth.",

      "explanation": "The mastoid does not reach adult size at birth. It develops fully by 2 years of age. In infants and children up to 2 years of age, the mastoid process is not developed completely. So, \nthe facial nerve lies just beneath the skin near its exit. Hence, during surgical procedures, the \nincision is given slanting posteriorly, avoiding the lower part of the mastoid. This spares the facial \nnerve.",

      "explanation": "The persistence of the petrosquamous suture is called Korner’s septum and it is responsible for \nthe difficulty in locating the mastoid antrum and the deeper cells. Korner’s septum separates superficial squamosal cells from the deep petrosal cells. Incomplete removal of disease at mastoidectomy can occur if Korner’s septum is not \nidentified.

      "explanation": "The saccule develops from pars inferior. The development of the inner ear begins in the 3rd week of fetal life and is completed by the 16th \nweek. The surface ectoderm on each side of the rhombencephalon thickens to form otic/auditory \nplacodes, which then invaginate to form the otic vesicle (otocysts). The cells of the otic vesicle differentiate to form ganglion cells, which later develop into the \nvestibulocochlear ganglia. Later each otic vesicle divides into a dorsal component called pars \nsuperior and a ventral component called pars inferior. Pars superior gives rise to the utricle, semicircular canals, and endolymphatic ducts. Pars inferior \ngives rise to saccule and cochlear duct. The saccule is connected to the cochlea through a narrow \nduct called ductus reuniens.",
