      "explanation": "Allergic rhinitis is an IgE-mediated immunologic response of nasal mucosa to airborne allergens. Patients typically present with recurrent bouts of sneezing, nasal obstruction, watery nasal \ndischarge, and itching and clinical signs include allergic shiners (dark circles around the eyes) and \nallergic salute (black transverse nasal crease on the dorsum of the nose due to repeated upward \nrubbing). Treatment options include: • Avoidance of the allergen • Treatment with drugs like oral antihistamines, intranasal corticosteroids, intranasal cromolyn \nsodium • Immunotherapy is through the delivery of allergen in gradual increasing doses till the \nmaintenance dose is reached. It suppresses the development of IgE. It has to be given for a year to \nsee significant improvement in symptoms. Intranasal corticosteroids (INCS) remain the preferred monotherapy for persistent allergic rhinitis \n(AR). However, additional studies support the additive benefit of combination treatment with \nINCS and intranasal antihistamines in AR. For patients receiving INCS, an intranasal \ndecongestant may be added to the treatment for up to 4 weeks. 365 \nSold by @itachibot",
