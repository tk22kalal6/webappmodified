A cochlear implant is an electronic device for severe to profound SNHL and who cannot benefit \nfrom a hearing aid. It converts sound to an electrical signal (transduction) and delivers this to the \nauditory nerve. Prerequisites include an intact cochlear nerve and higher auditory pathway. In the auditory brainstem implant, the site of the implant is the lateral recess of the \nfourth ventricle. It is used when the cochlear nerve is not intact. 69 \nSold by @itachibot",
