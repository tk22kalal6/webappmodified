      "correct_answer": "a",
      "explanation": "Angiofibroma is a histologically benign tumor but locally aggressive. It is a rare tumor, though it \nis the commonest of all benign tumors of the nasopharynx. Angiofibroma arises from the sphenopalatine foramen. Recurrent spontaneous epistaxis is the \nmost common presentation of angiofibroma. 500 \nSold by @itachibot The investigation of choice is a CT scan. There is anterior bowing of the maxillary sinus's posterior \nwall, which is referred to as the Holman-Miller sign/ antral sign. Surgery is the treatment of choice. Radiotherapy is used for tumors with intracranial extension. \nChemotherapy is used in combination with surgery or as monotherapy when surgery is \ncontraindicated.",

      "correct_answer": "a",
      "explanation": "The image shows a nasopharyngeal mass suggestive of juvenile nasopharyngeal angiofibroma \n(JNA), which is causing difficulty in breathing and swallowing. It is more common in males. The tumor is predominantly seen in adolescent males in the second decade of life. It is thought to \nbe testosterone dependent. Patients have a hamartomatous nidus of vascular tissue in the \nnasopharynx which is activated to form angiofibroma when male sex hormones appear. A biopsy is contraindicated due to the risk of severe bleeding. The vessels lack contractile \ncomponents and hence bleeding cannot be controlled with adrenaline.",

      "explanation": "Nasopharyngeal angiofibroma presents with rhinolalia clausa (hyponasal speech), not rhinolalia \naperta (hypernasal speech). The patients present with progressive nasal obstruction and hyponasal speech due to mass in the \npostnasal space. Profuse, recurrent, and spontaneous epistaxis is the most common presentation. \nThe patients may be markedly anemic due to repeated blood loss. Conductive hearing loss and otitis media with effusion occur due to obstruction of the eustachian \ntube. It can spread to the orbit giving rise to proptosis and broadening of the nasal bridge, giving rise to \nfrog face deformity. Other features include swelling of the cheek and cranial nerve palsies (II, III, \nIV, and VI).",

      "correct_answer": "c",
      "explanation": "Angiofibroma is made of vascular and fibrous tissues. Vessels of angiofibroma lack contractile \ncomponents, they are just endothelium-lined spaces with no elastic or muscle coat. This accounts for severe bleeding as the vessels lose the ability to contract. Hence the bleeding \ncannot be controlled by the application of adrenaline. Therefore, the biopsy is contraindicated.",

      "explanation": "The given clinical scenario is suggestive of nasopharyngeal angiofibroma. Investigation of choice \nto diagnose this condition is contrast enhancement CT scan (CECT). MRI scan can be used complementary to CT to see soft tissue extensions of the tumor. Carotid angiography shows the extent of the tumor, its vascularity, and feeding vessels which \nmostly come from the external carotid system. Embolization of vessels can be done at this time to \ndecrease bleeding at operation. A biopsy is contraindicated in this condition as it can lead to massive hemorrhage.",
