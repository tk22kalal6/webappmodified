      "correct_answer": "d",
      "explanation": "The structure marked A is the adenoids. It is not surrounded by a capsule. Adenoids are comprised of vertical ridges of lymphoid tissues separated by deep clefts. They form \nthe superior aspect of Waldeyer's ring. They have no crypts and no capsule, unlike palatine tonsils \nwhich have both. It is present at birth, enlarges up to the age of 6 years, and then starts regressing from puberty. It \ncompletely disappears by the age of 20 years.",

      "explanation": "The given x-ray shows enlarged adenoids and suggests the diagnosis of adenoid hypertrophy. \nPatients show an absent nasolabial fold. Clinical features: • Nasal obstruction is the most common symptom. This leads to mouth breathing. Nasal \nobstruction also interferes with feeding or suckling in a child. As respiration and feeding cannot \ntake place simultaneously, a child with adenoid enlargement fails to thrive. • Nasal discharge, sinusitis, and epistaxis. • Bilateral conductive hearing loss and serous otitis media due to eustachian tube obstruction. • Rhinolalia clausa - hyponasal voice. • Adenoid facies - elongated face with a dull expression, pinched up nose, absent nasolabial crease, \nopen mouth, prominent and crowded upper teeth. • Sleep apnoea - chronic cases lead to hypoxemia and pulmonary vasoconstriction. This \nconsequently leads to pulmonary hypertension and cor pulmonale. • Aprosexia - lack of concentration. 455 \nSold by @itachibot",

Rhinolalia clausa/ hyponasal voice can be seen in these patients. It is also seen in conditions like common cold, nasal allergy, etc. Option A - Hot potato voice is a muffled and thick speech often seen in a peritonsillar abscess \n(quinsy). Option C - Rhinolalia aperta causes a hypernasal voice.

      "correct_answer": "d",
      "explanation": "Beta 2 agonists have no role in conditions of upper airway obstruction like adenoid \nhypertrophy. They are bronchodilators used in lower airway obstructive diseases. When symptoms of adenoid hypertrophy are not marked, breathing exercises, decongestant nasal \ndrops, and antihistamines for any coexisting nasal allergy can cure the condition without resorting \nto surgery. Marked adenoid hypertrophy with associated complications can be treated with adenoidectomy \nand grommet insertion.",

      },
      "correct_answer": "d",
      "explanation": "Cleft palate is a contraindication to perform adenoidectomy as removal of adenoids causes \nvelopharyngeal insufficiency. Velopharyngeal insufficiency is a condition where the soft palate does not close tightly against the \nback of the throat. This leads to air coming out the nose (characterized by hypernasality) during \nspeech. Contraindications for adenoidectomy: • Cleft palate or submucous palate. • Hemorrhagic diathesis. • Acute infection of the upper respiratory tract.",

The patient complains of \nneck pain and develops torticollis. It is mostly due to spasm of paraspinal muscles but can also be \ndue to atlantoaxial dislocation requiring cervical collar and even traction.",

      "explanation": "Thornwaldt cyst is located in the midline of the posterior wall of the nasopharynx in the adenoid \nmass. It is an epithelial-lined median recess found within the adenoid mass and extends from \npharyngeal mucosa to the periosteum of the basiocciput. It represents the attachment of \nnotochord to the pharyngeal endoderm during embryonic life. When infected, it may be the cause of persistent postnasal discharge or crusting. Sometimes an \nabscess can form in the bursa (Thornwaldt’s disease).
