      "correct_answer": "c",
      "explanation": "The clinical scenario describes a patient with post-pregnancy hearing loss. The audiogram shows \nconductive deafness along with Carhart's notch (dip in bone conduction at 2000 Hz). These \nfindings are highly suggestive of otosclerosis. Ototoxicity, Meniere’s disease, and noise-induced hearing loss cause sensory neural hearing loss \n(SNHL) and not conductive hearing loss. Otosclerosis is caused by bony overgrowth involving the enchondral layer of the bony otic capsule. \nIt presents with bilateral progressive conductive hearing loss and tinnitus. It has an autosomal \ndominant inheritance and can worsen with stress and hormonal changes like during pregnancy \nand menopause. Stapedial otosclerosis is the most common type of otosclerosis. Here the lesion starts just in front \nof the oval window in an area called fistula ante fenestrae. The presence of a reddish hue on the promontory through the tympanic membrane, known as the \nSchwartze sign, suggests an active focus. PTA shows loss of air conduction with air-bone gap, \nmore for lower frequencies and Carhart's notch may be seen. Tympanometry shows an As type of \ntympanogram in which there is reduced compliance at or near the ambient air pressure. Medical management with sodium fluoride is used in the active stage. Definitive treatment is \nstapedectomy/stapedotomy with the placement of a prosthesis. Carhart notch usually disappears 278 \nSold by @itachibot after a successful stapedectomy. Other options: Option A: Ototoxicity causes SNHL and shows a high-frequency hearing loss in the SNHL curve. Option B: In Meniere's disease, pure tone audiometry shows an SNHL pattern with a rising curve \nin the early stages (as lower frequencies are involved first) and as the disease progresses higher \nfrequencies are involved, the curve becomes flat or a falling type. Option D: Noise-induced hearing loss is SNHL and PTA shows a characteristic acoustic dip at \n4000 Hz both for air and bone conduction.",

      "explanation": "In caloric testing, cold water irrigation produces horizontal nystagmus towards the opposite \nside of irrigation. The direction of nystagmus can be remembered by the mnemonic, COWS \n(cold–opposite, warm–same). The mechanism for the nystagmus is the creation of a temperature gradient by the cold water, \nwhich pulls the cupula away from the utricle, causing nystagmus towards the oppsite side. As the \nhorizontal semicircular canal is closer to the outer ear canal, most of the response comes from it \nand the nystagmus is horizontal. The Fitzgerald–Hallpike test (bithermal caloric test) is done to assess this phenomenon. The \npatient lies in a supine position with head tilted forward at a 30° angle, ensuring the horizontal \ncanal becomes vertical. Alternatingly, water at temperatures of 30°C and 44°C (7° below and \nabove normal body temperature, respectively) is irrigated into the ears for a duration of 40 \nseconds each. The examiner closely observes the patient's eyes for the emergence of nystagmus \nuntil its endpoint is reached. The time taken from the start of irrigation to the endpoint of \nnystagmus is recorded and plotted on a calorigram. If no nystagmus is evoked from either ear, the test is repeated with water at a temperature of 20°C \nfor a duration of 4 minutes before labeling the labyrinth dead. A 5-minute interval should be \nallowed between testing each ear to ensure accurate results.",
