This is called the curved membrane effect and it contributes to the \nimpedance matching mechanism of the ear. Other factors responsible for the impedance matching mechanism of the middle ear are: • The lever action of the ossicles- handle of malleus is 1.3 times longer than the long process of \nincus, providing a mechanical advantage of 1.3. • Hydraulic action of the tympanic membrane- relatively large area of the tympanic membrane \ncompared to the stapes footplate. 260 \nSold by @itachibot • The medial side of the tympanic membrane is multiphasic whereas the lateral side is uniphasic. \nThis provides a multiple integrated multilever mechanical advantage.",

      "explanation": "The negative Rinne test for 512 Hz indicates a minimum air-bone gap of 30 dB. 261 \nSold by @itachibot Rinne’s test is a tuning fork test performed commonly with tuning forks of frequencies such as \n128, 256, 512, and 1024 Hz. Rinne’s test is done by placing a vibrating tuning fork on the patient’s mastoid and when he stops \nhearing, it is brought beside the external auditory meatus (EAC). If he still hears the sound, air \nconduction (AC) is better than bone conduction (BC) i.e. AC&gt;BC. The inferences are as follows: • Rinne's test is considered positive (normal) when the air conduction AC&gt;BC is seen in normal \npeople and people with sensorineural deafness. • It is considered negative when the BC&gt;AC, and is seen in patients with conductive deafness. As a general prediction, a negative Rinne's test with any tuning fork frequency suggests a \nminimum hearing loss of at least 15 - 20 dB.The table below indicates a rough minimum air-bone \ngap for negative Rinne's test at different frequencies: A prediction of the air-bone gap can be made based on the combination of tuning fork tests of \n256, 512, and 1024 Hz: • A Rinne test negative for 256 Hz but positive for 512 Hz indicates an air-bone gap of 20-30 dB. • A Rinne test negative for 256 and 512 Hz but positive for 1024 Hz indicates an air-bone gap \nof 30-45 dB. • A Rinne test negative for 256, 512, and 1024 Hz indicates an air-bone gap of 45-60 dB.

      "explanation": "Noise-induced hearing loss (NIHL) damages the outer hair cells, starting in the basal turn of the \ncochlea. Outer hair cells are affected before the inner hair cells. NIHL occurs after chronic exposure to less intense sounds. The damage caused by noise trauma \ndepends on the frequency of noise (frequency of 2000 to 3000 Hz causes more damage) intensity, \nduration of the noise, and preexisting ear disease. The audiogram in noise-induced hearing loss shows a typical notch at 4000Hz both for air and \nbone conduction known as acoustic dip/boiler's notch. Patients at this stage complain of \nhigh-pitched tinnitus and difficulty hearing in noisy surroundings. Pre-employment and annual \naudiograms for persons working at places where noise is above 85 dB (A) help in the early 265 \nSold by @itachibot detection of NIHL. The human ear can hear frequencies from about 20 to 20,000 Hz. Below 20 Hz, the vibrations are \ninfra-audible, and above 20,000 Hz, they are ultra-sonic. Pure tone audiometry can detect only up \nto 8000 Hz. Extended high-frequency audiometry is recommended for early detection of hearing loss, as it can \nidentify hearing impairments before the frequencies necessary for speech comprehension are \naffected. Distortion product otoacoustic emissions is a more sensitive tool than conventional \naudiometry, particularly in children under 5 years old for early detection of hearing loss. A noise of ˜0 dB(A) SPL (acceptable noise levels, sound pressure level), 8 hours a day for 5 days \nper week is the maximum safe limit as recommended by the Ministry of Labour. As per WHO, 85 \ndB(A) is considered the highest safe exposure level up to a maximum of 8 hours. The silence zone extends to a distance of 100 meters around the premises of hospitals, nursing \nhomes, educational institutions, and courts. Permissible limits of noise as per the noise pollution (Regulation and Control) rules: Noise levels are measured in dB(A), which prioritizes middle-range frequencies for assessing \nnoise-induced hearing loss while giving less weightage to low and high frequencies.
