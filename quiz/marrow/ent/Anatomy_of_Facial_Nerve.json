The 2nd genu of the facial nerve is formed where the horizontal facial nerve takes a turn inferiorly \nat the junction between the medial and posterior walls of the middle ear. It continues as the vertical segment of the facial nerve behind the posterior wall of the middle ear. \nIt does not contain a ganglion and does not give any branches. The course of the facial nerve has 3 parts- • Intracranial • Intratemporal • Extracranial. Intratemporal part of the facial nerve has 4 segments- • Meatal • Labyrinthine • Tympanic/horizontal • Mastoid/vertical segments. Option A: Gasserian ganglion is present in the trigeminal nerve. Option B: The temporal segment of the facial nerve ends with the 2nd genu. The nerve then \npasses vertically downward to form the mastoid segment. The 2nd branch of facial nerve (nerve to \nstapedius) arises from this segment close to the level of 2nd genu and not from the 2nd genu.",

The nerve in the labyrinthine segment has the narrowest \ndiameter and the bony canal in this segment is also the narrowest.
