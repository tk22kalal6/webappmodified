Acute mastoiditis is used to refer to an acute infection that spreads from the mucosa, lining the \nmastoid air cells, to involve the bony walls of the mastoid air cell system. The image below shows a picture of acute mastoiditis: Blood leukocytes and ESR is raised. CT scan of the temporal bone shows clouding of air cells due \nto the collection of exudate in them. In later stages, a cavity may be seen in the mastoid. \nTreatment is done by administration of intravenous antibiotics and if indicated, surgical \nprocedures such as myringotomy and cortical mastoidectomy. Abscesses in Relation to mastoid infection are: • Bezold abscess lies deep to the sternocleidomastoid and presents as a swelling in the tip of the \nmastoid or the angle of the jaw and is seen in the upper part of the posterior triangle or the \nparapharyngeal space The images below show a picture of Bezold abscess: 148 \nSold by @itachibot Other abscesses in relation to mastoid infection: • Post auricular abscess - it is the most common abscess that forms over the mastoid.
