It lies on either side of the larynx and extends \nfrom pharyngoepiglottic fold to the upper end of oesophagus. Sinuses are air-containing cavities in certain bones of skull. It is divided into 2 groups. Anterior group includes • Maxillary • Frontal • Anterior ethmoidal sinuses. Posterior group includes • Posterior ethmoid • Sphenoid sinuses.",

      "explanation": "Occipitomental view is called Water's view. Water's view with an open mouth is known as Pierre's \nview. Among the given options, Water's view is the best answer. In Water's view, the patient’s head is positioned such that the nose and the chin touch the film \nwhile the X-rays are projected from backward. The mouth is usually kept open, which allows \nvisualizing the sphenoid sinus. Structures seen in Water’s view are: • Maxillary sinuses (seen best) • Frontal sinuses • Sphenoid sinus (if the film is taken with an open mouth) • Zygoma • Zygomatic arch • Nasal bone • Frontal process of the maxilla • Superior orbital fissure • Infratemporal fossa Other options: Option B: Towne's view is an angled anteroposterior radiograph of the skull. Structures seen are \nthe petrous part of the pyramids, arcuate eminence, superior semicircular canal, mastoid antrum, \ninternal auditory canal, tympanic cavity, cochlea, and external auditory canal. This view is taken 313 \nSold by @itachibot for acoustic neuroma and apical petrositis. Option C: Law's view is a lateral oblique X-ray view of the mastoid. Structures seen are the \nexternal auditory canal, mastoid air cells, tegmen, lateral sinus plate, and temporomandibular \njoint. Option D: Stenver's view is an X-ray view of the skull where the long axis of the petrous bone is \nparallel to the film. Structures seen are the entire petrous pyramid, arcuate eminence, internal \nauditory meatus, labyrinth with its vestibule, cochlea, and mastoid antrum. 314 \nSold by @itachibot Physiology of Nose and Paranasal Sinuses",
