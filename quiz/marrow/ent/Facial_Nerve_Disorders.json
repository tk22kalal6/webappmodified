      "correct_answer": "b",
      "explanation": "Right upper motor neuron (UMN) facial nerve palsy causes paralysis of lower facial muscles on \nthe left side. The upper part of the facial nerve’s motor nucleus, which innervates forehead muscles, receives \nfibers from both the cerebral hemispheres. The lower part of the nucleus, which supplies the \nlower face, only receives crossed fibers from the contralateral hemisphere. Therefore, the upper \npart of the face gets bilateral innervation and the lower part of the face gets crossed innervation \nfrom the opposite side. Hence, in supranuclear lesion (UMN palsy), forehead is spared and muscles of the lower half of \nthe opposite side of the face are affected. In LMN palsy, all muscles of the same side are affected. 229 \nSold by @itachibot",

      "explanation": "Noise intolerance in a patient with facial nerve palsy is due to stapedius muscle paralysis. The stapedius muscle is supplied by the facial nerve via nerve to stapedius. It acts by dampening \nthe loud sounds and the loss of this function results in hyperacusis. Tensor veli palatini helps in opening the eustachian tube, hence also called dilator tubae muscle. Tensor tympani, supplied by the mandibular branch of the trigeminal nerve, also helps in \ndampening the loud sounds. It is not involved in facial nerve palsy.",

      "explanation": "The site of lesion in this patient with loss of taste from anterior 2/3rd of tongue and absent \nacoustic reflex is at the tympanic segment. Injury to the greater superficial petrosal nerve leads to loss of lacrimation which is detected by the \nSchirmer test. It is the first branch given at the level of the geniculate ganglion. Injury to the nerve to stapedius, the first motor branch of the facial nerve, leads to loss of \nstapedial reflex and hyperacusis, which can be detected by tympanometry. Injury to chorda tympani nerve leads to loss of taste from anterior 2/3rd of the tongue which is \ndetected by electrogustometry and reduced submandibular and sublingual salivary flow detected \nby salivary flow test. So in this patient, the lesion is proximal to the origin of nerve to stapedius i.e. tympanic segment, \nand not proximal to geniculate ganglion as the lacrimation is normal. 233 \nSold by @itachibot",
