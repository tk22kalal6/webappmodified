      "correct_answer": "a",
      "explanation": "Inspiratory stridor is seen in supraglottic lesions. It is often produced in obstructive lesions of \nsupraglottis or pharynx, e.g. laryngomalacia or retropharyngeal abscess. 534 \nSold by @itachibot Expiratory stridor is produced in lesions of thoracic trachea, primary and secondary bronchi such \nas bronchial foreign body, and tracheal stenosis. Biphasic stridor is seen in lesions of glottis, subglottis, and cervical trachea like laryngeal \npapillomas, vocal cord paralysis, and subglottic stenosis. Stridor is an audible respiratory noise that gets produced by turbulent airflow through an \nobstructed upper airway. It is an inspiratory sound that may have an expiratory component. It is \ndistinct from stertor which is a snoring-like noise produced from an obstructed nasopharynx or \noropharynx. The intensity and pitch of sounds originating from the respiratory system vary based on their site \nof origin within the respiratory tract and may be heard with or without a stethoscope. Usually, the \npitch of the sound increases, and the intensity decreases as one goes lower into the respiratory \ntract.",

      "explanation": "The image showing grape-like projections, involving the anterior part of the vocal cords depicts \na laryngeal papilloma. Laryngeal papilloma is a benign tumor of the larynx caused by the human papillomavirus (HPV \ntype 6 and 11). They can occur in children, most commonly around 3 -5 years of age (juvenile \npapillomatosis), as well as in adults. They involve the supraglottic and glottic regions of the \nlarynx. Seeding of the lesions can occur during invasive laryngeal procedures, such as intubation. \nThey have a high recurrence rate and very low potential for malignancy. Adult-onset laryngeal papillomatosis is less common and usually seen in males aged 30-50 years. \nIt is less aggressive and involves the anterior part of the vocal cords. The treatment is the same as \njuvenile papillomatosis. Patients present with hoarseness, aphonia, dyspnea, or stridor. Laryngoscopy shows pinkish to \nwhite grape-like projections that can be sessile or pedunculate with a visible central vascular \ncore. The diagnosis is confirmed by direct laryngoscopy and biopsy. Treatment consists \nof micro-laryngoscopy and CO2 laser excision. The image below depicts laryngeal papillomatosis on laryngoscopy: Reinke's edema (Option A) is a collection of fluid in the subepithelial space of Reinke.

      "correct_answer": "b",
      "explanation": "The given clinical scenario of a child presenting with chronic hoarseness (3 months) of voice and \nrespiratory distress for 2 weeks suggests the diagnosis of respiratory papillomatosis (juvenile \npapillomatosis). Croup (Option A) and acute epiglottitis (Option D), which cause acute upper respiratory tract \nobstruction, are ruled out due to the chronic nature of the symptoms. In croup, the upper airway \nobstruction becomes apparent after 1 to 3 days of low-grade fever, rhinorrhea, and pharyngitis. On \nthe other hand, in epiglottitis, a child experiences respiratory distress within hours of developing \na fever. Vocal nodules (Option C) are not typically associated with respiratory distress. Respiratory papillomatosis is the most common respiratory tract neoplasm in children. They are \nsimple warts (benign tumors) caused by human papillomavirus types 6 and 11 commonly seen in \nchildren aged 3 to 5 years. The course involves remissions and exacerbations of recurrent papillomas, mostly affecting the \nglottic area (vocal cords), and supraglottis. The patient presents with progressively worsening \nhoarseness, sleep-disordered breathing, dyspnea, stridor, and severe airway obstruction if left \nuntreated. Diagnosis confirmed by direct laryngoscopy, which shows grape-like projections (shown below), \nand biopsy. Treatment consists of micro laryngoscopy and CO2 laser excision. Antivirals like \ninterferon alpha2a, ribavirin, cidofovir, and acyclovir are used as adjunct therapies. 540 \nSold by @itachibot Other options: Option A: Croup (laryngotracheobronchitis) is caused by the parainfluenza virus. The patient \ninitially presents with an upper respiratory tract infection (rhinorrhea, pharyngitis, cough, \nlow-grade fever) followed by a characteristic barking cough, hoarseness, and inspiratory stridor. Option C: Vocal nodule (singer’s or screamer's nodule) occurs as a result of chronic vocal abuse. \nThey appear symmetrically at the junction of the anterior one-third and posterior two third of the \nvocal cord. The patient presents with chronic hoarseness and voice fatigue. The image below shows symmetric vocal nodules: Option D: Acute epiglottitis is caused by streptococcus pyogenes, pneumococci, Hemophilus \ninfluenzae, and staphylococcus aureus. It is characterized by an acute rapidly progressive course \nof high-grade fever, dyspnea, and stridor. 541 \nSold by @itachibot Voice and Speech Disorders",
