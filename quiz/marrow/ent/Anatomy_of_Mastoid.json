      "correct_answer": "d",
      "explanation": "The flat non-ciliated epithelium is found in the mastoid air cells and the epitympanum. The mucosal lining of the middle ear is continuous with that of the nasopharynx but shows \nvariations: • Bony eustachian tube- ciliated columnar • Cartilaginous eustachian tube- ciliated pseudostratified columnar • Protympanum- ciliated columnar • Most of the middle ear space- cuboidal • Epitympanum &amp; mastoid air cells- flat non-ciliated.",

      },
      "correct_answer": "a",
      "explanation": "The mastoid antrum is the largest mastoid air cell. It is the most constant mastoid air cell because it is present even in a sclerotic mastoid. The attic or the epitympanum is the part of the middle ear adjacent to its roof. Aditus ad antrum is the pathway or the connection between mastoid antrum and attic.",

      "correct_answer": "c",
      "explanation": "The mandible is not a pneumatic bone. Some bones of the skull, notably the mastoid process of the temporal bone and the paranasal \nsinuses of the frontal, maxilla, sphenoid and ethmoid bones, many of the internal cavities are \nfilled with air, i.e. they are variably pneumatized. The maxillae are the largest of the pneumatized bones of the midface. They contain the maxillary \nair sinuses and bear the upper teeth. The mastoid consists of a bone cortex with a 'honeycomb' of air cells underneath.",

      "correct_answer": "a",
      "explanation": "The type of mastoid pneumatization in the given clinical scenario is acellular or sclerotic mastoid. Here, sclerosis and loss of aeration of mastoid air cells are seen. Sclerotic mastoids contain only \nmastoid antrum which is small with anteposed sigmoid sinus. It can occur due to eustachian or \nmiddle ear disease in childhood preventing mastoid development. Other types of mastoids pneumatization: • Well-pneumatized or cellular- contains multiple air spaces • Diploetic- contains air cells and marrow spaces.",

      "explanation": "The parietal is not a part of the temporal bone. The temporal bone consists of the following parts: Squamous part- anterosuperiorly It articulates with the parietal bone. The persistence of petrosquamous suture is called Korner's \nseptum. Mastoid part- posteroinferiorly. Its outer surface forms a conical projection called the mastoid process. Sternocleidomastoid, \nsplenius capitis and longissimus capitis attach here. Petrous part- medially • The arcuate eminence is related to the superior semicircular canal below • The posterior surface contains the internal auditory meatus (IAM). The vestibular aqueduct is \npresent behind the IAM. • The inferior surface contains the carotid canal and the jugular fossa (jugular notch). Tympanic part- centrally • It contains the external auditory meatus (EAM), and the bony EAM is 16 mm long. 58 \nSold by @itachibot • The suprameatal triangle is present above the EAM Styloid process- anteroinferior it gives attachment to: • 3 muscles - stylohyoid, styloglossus, stylopharyngeus • 2 ligaments - stylohyoid ligament, stylomandibular ligament Zygomatic process The temporal bone gives the zygomatic process which articulates with the temporal process of \nthe zygomatic bone to form the zygomatic arch. 59 \nSold by @itachibot",
