Clinical features of DNS: • Nasal obstruction - unilateral in C-shaped deviation and bilateral in S-shaped deviation • Headache - may be due to associated sinusitis or due to spur pressing on the lateral wall of the \nnose • Sinusitis - due to obstruction of ostia and poor ventilation of sinuses • Epistaxis - from vessels over spur or due to crusting of the nasal mucosa • Anosmia - especially in bilateral nasal obstruction • Compensatory hypertrophy of turbinates on roomier side • Frequent middle ear infections 375 \nSold by @itachibot • Association with external deformities",

      "explanation": "The clinical test depicted in the image is Cottle’s test where the cheek is drawn laterally while the \npatient breathes quietly. This test is used to assess the patency of the nasal valve in patients with a deviated nasal septum. \nIf the nasal airway improves on the test side, the test is positive and indicates an abnormality of \nthe vestibular component of the nasal valve on that side. Option A: Epley’s maneuver is used in the treatment of BPPV. Option B: Heimlich manoeuvre is used in the treatment of accidental inhalation of foreign body. \nProcedure: Stand behind the person and place your arms around his lower chest and give four \nabdominal thrusts. The residual air in the lungs can dislodge the foreign body providing some \nairway. 376 \nSold by @itachibot Option D: Trotter’s method is used in the treatment of epistaxis. In Trotter’s method, the patient \nis made to sit, leaning a little forward over a basin to spit any blood. He should pinch the nose \nfirmly for 5 to 10 mins and breathe quietly from the mouth.",
