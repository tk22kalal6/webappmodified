Foreign body can cause unilateral nasal obstruction and subsequent superimposed infection \nwhich causes malodorous discharge. It may often be blood-stained. Option B: Atrophic rhinitis usually starts at puberty and mainly presents with nasal obstruction \nand foul smell from the nose. Epistaxis occurs only after the removal of crusts.

The artery which \nis most commonly ligated in a case of refractory posterior epistaxis is the sphenopalatine artery. Posterior epistaxis is most commonly seen in older age groups. The bleeding is spontaneous, often \ndue to hypertension, and is severe, requiring hospitalization. Refractory epistaxis is defined as \nrecurrent or persistent bleeding after appropriate packing or multiple episodes of epistaxis during \na short period, each requiring medical attention. Sphenopalatine artery ligation gives high success in the control of refractory posterior \nbleed. Therefore, transnasal endoscopic sphenopalatine artery ligation (TESPAL) is the preferred \nmethod. It is ligated at sphenopalatine foramen situated 1 cm behind the posterior end of middle turbinate.

      "explanation": "Ethmoidal artery can cause epistaxis not controlled by external carotid artery ligation. 335 \nSold by @itachibot The ethmoidal artery is a branch of internal carotid artery, whereas sphenopalatine, greater \npalatine and facial artery are branches of the external carotid artery. Hence if the bleeding is not \ncontrolled by external carotid artery ligation, the subsequent step would be to ligate the ethmoidal \nartery. Epistaxis may be classified as anterior or posterior epistaxis. Little's area is situated in the anterior inferior part of the nasal septum, just above the vestibule. It \nis the site of epistaxis in 90% of the cases. Four arteries anastomose here to form a vascular plexus called the Kiesselbach’s plexus. This area \nis exposed to the drying effect of inspiratory current and to fingernail trauma and is the usual site \nfor epistaxis in children and young adults. The four contributing arteries are as follows: • Septal branch of sphenopalatine and greater palatine branches of the maxillary artery, which in \nturn is a branch of the external carotid artery. • Septal branch of the superior labial artery which in turn is a branch of the facial artery.
