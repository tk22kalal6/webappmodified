      "correct_answer": "c",
      "explanation": "Dysphonia plica ventricularis is a low-pitched voice produced by the vestibular folds. It can either be due to functional voice misuse or due to organic lesions like fixation of the true \nvocal cord. It is characterized by a low-pitched, rough and strained voice. Treatment includes voice therapy and psychological counseling.",

      "correct_answer": "a",
      "explanation": "Spasmodic dysphonia is not only a local laryngeal disorder. It is associated with many \nneurological conditions too. There are 2 types of spasmodic dysphonia: Adductor dysphonia • The adductor muscles of the larynx go into spasm causing vocal cords to go into adduction. The \nvoice becomes strained/strangled. • Treatment consists of botulinum toxin injections in the thyroarytenoid muscles on one or both \nsides to relieve the spasm. Abductor dysphonia • It is due to the spasm of the posterior cricoarytenoid muscle and thus the glottis is kept open. • The patient gets a breathy voice or breathy breaks in voice. Treatment consists of botulinum toxin injections in posterior cricoarytenoid muscles. Patients \nwho do not respond to toxin injection can be treated by type 1 thyroplasty or fat injection.",

Rhinolalia clausa or hyponasality is a lack of nasal resonance for words that are resonated in the \nnasal cavity. Words with M, N, NG sounds like B, D, G.

It is seen when certain words which have little nasal resonance are resonated through the nose. \nThe defect is the failure of the nasopharynx to cut off from the oropharynx or abnormal \ncommunication between the oral and nasal cavities. Common causes are: • Velopharyngeal insufficiency • Congenitally short soft palate • Submucous palate • Large nasopharynx • Cleft of soft palate 551 \nSold by @itachibot • Paralysis of soft palate • Post adenoidectomy • Oronasal fistula • Familial speech pattern • Habitual speech pattern.
