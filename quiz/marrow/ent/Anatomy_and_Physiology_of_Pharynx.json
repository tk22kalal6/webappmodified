Pyriform sinus lies on either side of the larynx and extends from the pharyngoepiglottic fold to the \nupper end of the esophagus. It forms the lateral channel for food. The rich lymphatic network of \npyriform fossa explains the high frequency of nodal metastasis seen in carcinoma of this region. 449 \nSold by @itachibot Adenoids",
