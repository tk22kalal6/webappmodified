      "correct_answer": "c",
      "explanation": "Nasopharyngeal carcinoma is also known as Guangdong tumor. This is because the Southern \nChinese province of Guangdong has the highest prevalence of the tumor. Chinese, especially from southeastern China (Canton), have a higher genetic susceptibility to \nnasopharyngeal cancer (NPC). Chinese emigrants are also genetically more susceptible, however, \nthe susceptibility falls in subsequent generations. Other South-East Asian countries such as Indonesia, Malaysia, and people of Mongoloid origin \nare also more susceptible.",

      "explanation": "Human papillomavirus is not associated with a high incidence of nasopharyngeal carcinoma in \nhigh-risk populations of China. EBV (Epstein Barr virus) causes nasopharyngeal carcinoma. \nHPV(Human papillomavirus) causes inverted papilloma of the nose. High-risk populations such as the Chinese have a very high incidence of nasopharyngeal \ncarcinoma. The following factors have been implicated in the pathogenesis: • Burning of incense or wood (polycyclic hydrocarbons) • Consumption of preserved salted fish (nitrosamines) • Vitamin C deficient diet (vitamin C blocks nitrosification of amines and is thus protective) 511 \nSold by @itachibot",

The most likely speech pattern, in this case, is rhinolalia clausa or \ndenasal speech, due to obstruction of the nasopharynx by the tumor. 512 \nSold by @itachibot Rhinolalia clausa is the lack of nasal resonance for words resonated in the nasal cavity and is \nusually seen due to blockage of nose or nasopharynx Other nasal symptoms of nasopharyngeal carcinoma are: • Nasal obstruction • Nasal discharge • Epistaxis Option B- Rhinolalia aperta (hypernasal voice) is seen in Velopharyngeal insufficiency.
