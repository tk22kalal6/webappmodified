The presence of edema interferes with the accurate reduction of the fracture. In most cases, the \ndeformity is due to edema. So, ice packs and head elevation are advised initially after injury. After \n3-5 days, the edema would subside and the underlying deformity will be apparent on clinical \nassessment. After 2 weeks it is difficult to reduce since the process of callus formation and the bony and \nfibrous union would have started.",
