The golden yellow discoloration of the tympanic membrane is caused by the clear watery \nstraw-colored effusion filling the middle ear. Since the fluid is clear, one can see the structures of \nthe middle ear quite clearly on otoscopy. Patients having serous otitis media will have hearing loss that rarely exceeds 40 dB. This deafness \ncan pass unnoticed, and maybe accidentally discovered during audiometric screening tests. \nBecause of hearing loss, the development of speech is delayed or defective. Otoscopic findings in serous otitis media: • Fluid level and air bubbles are seen when fluid is thin and the tympanic membrane transparent. • In chronic cases, the fluid becomes very sticky. Hence, the name glue ear. • The tympanic membrane is often dull and opaque with a loss of light reflex. • The mobility of the tympanic membrane is restricted.",
