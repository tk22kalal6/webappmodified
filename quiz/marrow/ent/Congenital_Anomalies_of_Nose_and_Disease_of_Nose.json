      "explanation": "Option D is a case of acromegaly, in which there may be enlargement of the nose. Saddle nose \ndeformity only occurs when the bridge of the nose collapses. Causes for saddle nose/depressed dorsum of nose: • Nasal trauma causing depressed fractures - most common etiology. • Excessive removal of septum in submucous resection • Destruction of septal cartilage by haematoma or abscess • Leprosy • Syphilis • Tuberculosis. Option A is a case of tertiary syphilis. Option B is a case of lepromatous leprosy. Option C is a case of septal hematoma.",

It is the herniation of brain \ntissue along with its meninges through a congenital bony defect. 350 \nSold by @itachibot Nasal obstruction is the most common symptom. It presents as a cystic, bluish, compressible, \ntranslucent mass at the root of the nose (nasofrontal variety), side of the nose (nasoethmoid \nvariety), or at the anteromedial aspect of the orbit (nasoorbital variety).

      "explanation": "There is no CSF leakage in nasal glioma. It is a nipped-off portion of an encephalocele with no \ncommunication with the cranial cavity. They usually present as a firm, subcutaneous swelling causing nasal obstruction. Furstenberg's test - compression of the ipsilateral internal jugular vein usually causes an \nencephalocele to enlarge, but not a glioma. So, this test is negative in nasal glioma. 60% of nasal gliomas are extra-nasal, 30% are intranasal, and 10% are both intranasal and \nextra-nasal.

Deformity is called \ntapir nose. Option A: Atrophic rhinitis doesn’t cause woody nose. Option B: Rhinophyma or potato tumor is due to hypertrophy of sebaceous gland and presents as \nswelling over tip of nose. 352 \nSold by @itachibot Option C: Rhinosporidiosis is a granulomatous condition caused by Rhinosporidium seeberi and \npresents with nasal discharge, epistaxis and nasal obstruction by a polypoidal mass.",

      "explanation": "Biopsy findings of Mikulicz cells and Russell's bodies are characteristic findings in \nrhinoscleroma. Medical management is the mainstay treatment for rhinoscleroma. Streptomycin(1 \ng/day) and tetracycline (2 g/day) are given for a minimum of 4-6 weeks and continued till 2 \nconsecutive biopsies are negative. Surgery is reserved to establish airway or correct deformity. Biopsy in the case of rhinoscleroma shows infiltration of submucosa with plasma cells, \nlymphocytes, eosinophils, Mikulicz cells, and Russell bodies. Mikulicz cells are large foam cells with a central nucleus and vacuolated cytoplasm containing \ncausative bacilli. Russell bodies are homogenous eosinophilic inclusion bodies found in the plasma cells. They \noccur due to the accumulation of immunoglobulins secreted by the plasma cells. The following image shows rhinoscleroma with Mikulicz cells. H&amp;E showing a mixture of plasma cells (arrow), lymphocytes (short arrow), Miculikz cells \nwhich are vacuolated macrophages containing causative bacilli (double arrow).
