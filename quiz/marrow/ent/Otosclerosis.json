      "correct_answer": "c",
      "explanation": "Otosclerosis affects the otic capsule. The otic capsule is the dense bony labyrinth of the inner ear that surrounds the cochlea, the \nvestibule, and the semicircular canals. In otosclerosis, one or more foci of irregularly laid spongy \nbone replace part of the normally dense bone. The inner ear is divided into: • The membranous labyrinth is also called the otic labyrinth. It is filled with endolymph. • The bony labyrinth, which is also called the otic capsule. • Periotic labyrinth, which is the space between the bony and membranous labyrinth and is filled \nwith perilymph.",

Within the enchondral layer, there are sometimes islands of unossified cartilage rests that later \ngive rise to otosclerosis. The otic capsule is made of 3 layers: • Endosteal: Innermost • Enchondral: Middle layer derived from cartilage that ossifies • Periosteal: Outermost layer",

The otosclerotic foci in the stapedial type of otosclerosis can be of various types: • Anterior focus - involving only the fissula ante fenestrum • Posterior focus- involving only the fissula post fenestrum • Circumferential - affects the margin of the footplate only (annular ligament alone) • Biscuit type - affects the entire footplate except for the annular ligament • Obliterative- affects the entire footplate &amp; its annular ligament.",

But in India, otosclerosis seems to \npredominate in males. Stapedotomy is contraindicated in children because recurrent eustachian tube dysfunction is \ncommon in them.

But, in an ear with otosclerosis of \nthe footplate, there will be no movements and the patient will continue to hear the sound. Thus, \nGelle’s test is considered positive in normal persons and in those with sensorineural hearing loss. \nIt is negative when the ossicular chain is fixed or disconnected. Stenger’s test is done to rule out malingering. Schwabach is a tuning fork test that compares the bone conduction of the patient with that of the \nexaminer.
