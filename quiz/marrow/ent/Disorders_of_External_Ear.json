They are seen as \nskin-covered pieces of cartilage anywhere between the tragus and the angle of the mouth. The clinical features of facial asymmetry, intellectual disability, limbal dermoid, and pre-auricular \ntags and mixed or conductive hearing loss point to a diagnosis of Goldenhar \nsyndrome (oculoauriculovertebral spectrum). Clinical features include: • Hypoplasia of the malar, maxillary, and mandibular regions • Macrostomia and microtia • Preauricular and facial skin tags • Hemivertebrae (usually cervical) • Intellectual disability • Cardiac, renal, and central nervous system (CNS) anomalies • Ocular features- Limbal dermoids, upper lid notching or coloboma, microphthalmos, disc \ncoloboma",

Auricular hematoma is a collection of blood between the auricular cartilage and its \nperichondrium.

      },
      "correct_answer": "b",
      "explanation": "During syringing, the pinna is pulled upwards and backward and the water jet is directed along \nthe posterosuperior wall of the meatus. This is preferred because of two anatomical reasons: • On maneuvering the pinna to bring the EAC into a straight configuration, the posterior wall is \nstraighter and easily accessible than the anterior wall. • The posteroinferior wall of EAC is supplied by the vagus. Direct stimulation of this can lead to \nsudden cardiac arrest. Complications of syringing: • Vertigo– caloric stimulation of lateral semicircular canal if water is too hot or too cold • Rupture of the tympanic membrane • Reactivation of quiescent otitis media, if there is pre-existing perforation Contraindications for syringing: • Presence of ear infection, tympanic membrane perforation • Presence of grommet or history of ear surgery",

      "correct_answer": "d",
      "explanation": "Keratosis obturans, by pressure effect, causes absorption of bone which causes widening (not \nnarrowing) of the meatus leading to facial nerve palsy. Normally, epithelium from the surface of the tympanic membrane migrates onto the posterior \nmeatal wall. Failure of this migration, or obstruction to migration caused by wax, may lead to \nkeratosis obturans which is the accumulation of a large plug of desquamated keratin in the \nexternal auditory meatus. Features of keratosis obturans: • Severe otalgia • Conductive hearing loss • Thickened tympanic membrane • Keratin plug/pearly white mass occluding the canal • Widened ear canal- may lead to facial nerve paralysis • Hyperemia of canal skin, sometimes with ulcerations and granulomas 101 \nSold by @itachibot Staphylococcus aureus is the most frequent isolate. Keratosis oburans may be associated with systemic conditions like bronchiectasis and chronic \nsinusitis.",

      "correct_answer": "a",
      "explanation": "The surgery done to widen the cartilaginous part of the external auditory canal is meatoplasty. Meatoplasty is a surgical procedure that involves the removal of a crescent-shaped portion of \nconchal cartilage to widen the external auditory meatus. It is performed in combination with all \ncanal wall-down procedures like modified radical and radical mastoidectomies, for easy access to \nthe mastoid cavity for periodic inspection and cleaning. It is also done as an isolated procedure in elderly people with sagging auricles. A \nsagging auricle causes obstruction to the meatus leading to the retention of wax and difficulty in \nhearing. Other options: Option B: Tympanoplasty is the surgical reconstruction to correct damage in the middle ear and \nrestore the integrity of the tympanic membrane for improved hearing. It is ossicular \nreconstruction only or ossicular reconstruction with myringoplasty. Option C: Myringoplasty refers to the reconstruction of the tympanic membrane only. Option D: Otoplasty is the correction of external ear/deformities of the pinna.",
