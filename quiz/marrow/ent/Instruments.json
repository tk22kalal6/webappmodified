Option A: Lempert’s curette (scoop) is used for removal of bony septa and granulations in mastoid \nsurgery. 573 \nSold by @itachibot Option B: Lempert’s endaural retractor is used for endaural approach to ear surgery. It has two \nlateral blades which retract the flaps and a third central blade with holes. The central blade \nretracts the temporalis muscle. The central blade can be fixed to the body of the retractor by its \nhole. Option C: Lempert’s endaural speculum is used to spread open the meatus when giving the local \ninjection or making an endaural incision. 574 \nSold by @itachibot Lempert’s incision is used in endaural approach. It consists of two parts: Lempert I: It is a semicircular incision, made from 12 o’clock to 6 o’clock position in the posterior \nmeatal wall at the bony-cartilaginous junction. Lempert II: Starts from the first incision at 12 o’clock and then passes upwards in a curvilinear \nfashion between tragus and the crus of helix. It passes through the incisura terminalis and thus \ndoes not cut the cartilage. Both mastoid and external canal surgery can be done.",

      "explanation": "The instrument is Rose’s sinus douching cannula. It is used in irrigation of the maxillary sinus, \nwhich should already have a nasoantral window due to intranasal antrostomy or Caldwell Luc \noperation. The direction of the tip is indicated by the hook outside. Note: Trephination (also known as trepanning or burr holing) is a surgical intervention where a hole is \ndrilled, incised or scraped into the skull using simple surgical tools. Trephination of frontal sinus \nis done for acute frontal sinusitis if there is persistence or exacerbation of pain or pyrexia in spite \nof medical treatment for 48 h or if the lid swelling is increasing and threatening orbital cellulitis.",

      "explanation": "The image is of a Digital audiometer. An audiometer is an electronic device that produces pure tones, which can be increased or \ndecreased in 5 dB steps. The amount of intensity that has to be raised above the normal level is a \nmeasure of the degree of hearing loss at that frequency. This is charted in the form of a graph 577 \nSold by @itachibot called an audiogram. The difference in the thresholds of air and bone conduction (A–B gap) is a measure of the degree \nof conductive deafness. Uses: • To measure the threshold of hearing of air and bone conduction • Helps to predict speech reception threshold • To diagnose the type of hearing loss and measure the degree • For the prescription of hearing aids • Helps to find the degree of handicap for medicolegal purposes • A record can be kept for future reference.",

      "explanation": "The image is of a tympanometer. It is used in evaluating the status of the middle ear. It is based on a simple principle that when a sound strikes the tympanic membrane, some of the \nsound energy is absorbed while the rest is reflected. A stiffer tympanic membrane would reflect \nmore sound energy than a compliant one. By charting the compliance of the tympano-ossicular system against various pressure changes, \ndifferent types of graphs called tympanograms are as follows: 578 \nSold by @itachibot",
