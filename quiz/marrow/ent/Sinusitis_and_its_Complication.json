      "explanation": "The frontal sinus is best seen in Caldwell's view (occipitofrontal view or nose-forehead position). The structures seen in Caldwell's view include: • Frontal sinuses (seen best) • Ethmoid sinuses • Maxillary sinuses • Frontal process of the zygoma and the zygomatic process of the frontal bone • Superior margin of the orbit and lamina papyracea • Superior orbital fissure 439 \nSold by @itachibot • Foramen rotundum (inferolateral to superior orbital fissure) The nose and forehead are touching the X-ray film and the X-ray beam is projected 15 degrees \ncaudally in Caldwell's view. Other options: Option A: Water's view (occipitomental view or nose-chin position) is a radiographic view where \nan X-ray beam is angled at 45 degrees to the orbitomeatal line. Structures seen are the maxillary \nsinus (best seen), sphenoid sinus (if the film is taken with an open mouth), frontal sinus, zygoma, \nzygomatic arch, nasal bone, and infratemporal fossa. Option C: Pierre's view is the occipitomental with an open mouth. It helps in visualizing the \nsphenoid sinus as well, in addition to the sinuses that can be seen in water's view. Option D: Towne's view is an angled anteroposterior radiograph of the skull. Structures seen are \nthe petrous part of the pyramids, arcuate eminence, superior semicircular canal, mastoid antrum, \ninternal auditory canal, tympanic cavity, cochlea, and external auditory canal. This view is taken \nfor acoustic neuroma and apical petrositis. 440 \nSold by @itachibot Anatomy and Physiology of Pharynx",
