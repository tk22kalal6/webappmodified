      "explanation": "244 \nSold by @itachibot The eustachian tube also called the auditory or pharyngotympanic tube connects the nasopharynx \nwith the tympanic cavity. It is 36 mm long in adults and is divided into two parts: • Bony part - forms the outer one-third of the tube as it is located near the middle ear and is 12 \nmm in size. • Fibrocartilaginous part - forms the inner two-third as it is located near the nasopharynx and is \n24 mm in size. In the middle ear it opens in the anterior wall and in the nasopharynx it opens 1-1.25 cm posterior \nto the posterior end of the inferior turbinate.",

Opening of the tube • The medial fibres of the tensor veli palatini are attached to the lateral lamina of the tube and \ncontract to open the tubal lumen. It is also called the dilator tubae muscle. • Accessory muscles for opening are levator veli palatine &amp; salpingopharyngeus Closure of the tube • It is mainly due to the elastic recoil of the cartilage aided by the high degree of elastin on the \nroof. Ostmann’s pad of fat helps to keep the tube closed. 246 \nSold by @itachibot",

      "explanation": "The Eustachian tube in children is wider, shorter (13-18mm), and more horizontal. The \ncartilaginous part is flaccid due to less elastin.

      "explanation": "247 \nSold by @itachibot Cleft palate is a cause for functional Eustachian tube (ET) obstruction. Eustachian tube obstruction can be mechanical, functional or both. Mechanical obstruction can \nresult from intrinsic causes such as inflammation or allergy or extrinsic causes such as tumour or \nadenoids. Functional obstruction is caused by collapse of the tube due to increased cartilage \ncompliance or failure of active tubal opening mechanism due to poor function of tensor veli \npalatini. In the cleft palate, the obstruction is due to high elastin content at torus tubaris and the poor \nfunction of tensor veli palatini.",

      "explanation": "The given image depicts the Valsalva manoeuvre and it builds up positive pressure in the \nnasopharynx and not negative pressure. In this test, the patient is asked to close the mouth and nostrils and blow. This produces positive \npressure within the nasopharynx which opens the patent eustachian tube and is confirmed by the \ntympanic membrane bulge via otoscopy. It is used to assess the Eustachian tube patency and to auto-inflate the middle ear. It is contraindicated in: • Atrophic tympanic membrane as it might get ruptured. • URTI as the infection can spread into the middle ear. 248 \nSold by @itachibot",

      "explanation": "The procedure depicted in the image is Eustachian tube (ET) catheterization and it uses Politzer’s \nbag and an ET catheter. The catheter is passed along the nasal floor and manoeuvred into the ET opening and the bag is \ninsufflated. The outward movement of the tympanic membrane is then noted with an otoscope. It is an unsafe and outdated ET function test. It can lead to complications like TM rupture, \nscarring of ET, epistaxis, spread of nasal/pharyngeal infection to the middle ear. In the methylene blue dye test, the dye is instilled into the middle ear and the time taken by it to \nstain the pharynx is noted. Politzer test is a non-invasive alternative for this and works on the same principle. It uses a nasal \nolive instead of a catheter and is useful in children who can’t perform the Valsalva or Toynbee \ntest.",

      "explanation": "Tympanometry is the most accurate test to assess eustachian tube (ET) dysfunction. It is an \nobjective measure of ET function and does not rely on patient cooperation. In this test, the movement of TM is visualized to the variation in external canal pressure. The \ndisadvantage is middle ear pathologies can overshadow ET function.",

Option A: In HIV-related psychosis, there will be persecutory delusion, hallucination, and no ear \nfullness. Option B: The autophony of superior canal dehiscence syndrome usually involves hearing their \nown voice but not their breathing when compared with patients who have patulous eustachian \ntube.
