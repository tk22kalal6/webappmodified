The mucus blanket consists of a superficial mucus layer and a deeper serous layer, floating on the \ntop of cilia, which are constantly beating to carry it like a conveyer belt towards the nasopharynx. The mucus blanket moves at a speed of 5–10 mm/min and the complete sheet of mucus \nis cleared into the pharynx every 10–20 min. In mammals, cilia beat 10–20 times per second at \nroom temperature.",

      "explanation": "The given clinical scenario of chronic sinusitis, bronchiectasis and the X-ray showing dextrocardia \n(situs inversus) is suggestive of Kartagener syndrome. The mucociliary mechanism is \ncompromised in this case, due to immotile cilia. The lower airway is protected by the following mechanisms: • Mucociliary mechanism - The inspired pathogens and dust are trapped on the viscous mucous \nblanket. By beating of the cilia, the mucus is carried to the nasopharynx to be swallowed. • Chemical mechanisms - Immunoglobulins such as IgA, IgE, and Lactoferrin, lysozyme provide \ninnate immunity. • Sneezing - It is a protective reflex due to irritation of the nasal mucosa. 320 \nSold by @itachibot Temperature regulation and humidification are due to the large surface area of mucosa and highly \nvascular cavernous spaces. This is achieved by an increase or decrease in blood flow which in turn \nincrease or decrease the size of turbinates.",

Anosmia only occurs in \ncase it leads to nasal polyposis Causes of anosmia: • Nasal obstruction due to nasal polyps, enlarged turbinates, or mucosal edema due to infections. • Atrophic rhinitis, a degenerative disorder of nasal mucosa • Peripheral neuritis (toxic or influenzal) • Injury to olfactory nerves or olfactory bulb in fractures of anterior cranial fossa • Intracranial lesions like abscesses, tumors, or meningitis, which cause pressure on olfactory \ntracts. • COVID-19 is associated with a complete lack of taste and smell and is a common presenting \nsymptom",

It is seen classically in the recovery phase of postinfluenzal \nanosmia, and has been recently reported as a rare complication in post-COVID patients. The probable explanation is misdirected regeneration of nerve fibers. Intracranial tumors should \nbe ruled out in all cases of parosmia.

      "explanation": "Paranasal sinuses are ventilated during expiration. Ventilation of sinuses is paradoxical, as they \nare emptied of air during inspiration and filled with air during expiration. During inspiration, negative pressure is created in the nose by the air current, whereas during \nexpiration, positive pressure is created in the nose, and this sets up eddy currents, which ventilate \nthe sinuses.",
