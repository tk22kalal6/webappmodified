      "correct_answer": "b",
      "explanation": "The clinical manifestations of neck stiffness and severe headache with CT revealing blood in the \nbasal cistern points out to the diagnosis of subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH). Subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) is the bleeding into the subarachnoid space, which is the area \nbetween the arachnoid membrane and the pia mater surrounding the brain. The diagnosis is \nsuspected when a hyperattenuating material is seen filling the subarachnoid space. Most \ncommonly this is apparent around the circle of Willis, on account of the majority of berry \naneurysms occurring in this region (65%), or in the Sylvian fissure (30%). The modified Fisher scale is a method for grading SAH as seen on non-contrast CT (NCCT). The \nHunt and Hess scale describes the severity of SAH and is used as a predictor of survival. Xanthochromia on CSF is indicative of SAH in case of a negative CT scan.",

The characteristic \nbiconvex shape arises due to the limited ability of blood to expand within the fixed attachment of \nperiosteal dura to the cranial sutures.

Diffuse axonal injury (white matter shearing) is a severe form of traumatic brain injury caused by \nrotational acceleration/deceleration, leading to axonal shearing or disruption and forming \nmicrohemorrhages. Typically, these lesions are located at the grey-white matter junction in the \ncorpus callosum and, in severe cases, the brainstem. MRI is the preferred modality for assessing suspected diffuse axonal injury, even in patients with \nnormal CT of the brain. Gradient-recalled echo (GRE) &amp; susceptibility-weighted imaging \n(SWI) are the most sensitive MRI sequences for detecting micro-bleeds, which appear as \nhypointense foci.",

      "explanation": "178 \nSold by @itachibot The given CT image demonstrates the Mount Fuji sign, a specific radiological finding of \ntension pneumocephalus. This sign is characterised by bilateral compression and separation of the frontal lobes due to the \ntrapped subdural and interhemispheric free air, which appears as non-attenuating collections \nresembling the peak of Mount Fuji. Tension pneumocephalus is a rare, life-threatening condition most commonly caused by traumatic \nhead injury. Other causes include skull base fractures, neurosurgical procedures, infections \n(meningitis, encephalitis, or brain abscess), brain tumours, or the use of nitrous oxide during \nanaesthesia. The mass effect exerted by the subdural air compresses the underlying brain parenchyma, often \nresulting from a ball-valve mechanism causing one-way air entry into the subdural space. This \nraises intracranial pressure (ICP), distinguishing it from non-tension pneumocephalus, which \nlacks significant mass effect or raised ICP. The elevated ICP leads to rapid clinical deterioration, such as worsening consciousness, \nnecessitating urgent neurosurgical intervention to decompress the trapped air and prevent \npermanent brain damage.",

However, the initial investigation in suspected stroke cases is non-contrast CT due to its rapid \nacquisition time, widespread availability, and cost-effectiveness.

Hemangioblastomas are tumours of vascular origin and \noccur both in patients with Von Hippel Lindau (VHL) disease as well as sporadically. Von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) disease characterises the development of numerous benign and \nmalignant tumours in different organs. It is associated with a mutation in the VHL tumour \nsuppressor gene on chromosome 3 (VHL has 3 letters: chromosome 3). They are WHO-grade I \ntumours that can occur in the central nervous system. Features of VHL include pheochromocytoma, CNS hemangioblastoma - cerebellar and spinal, \nretinal haemangioblastoma, and choroid plexus papilloma.

Most common are bilateral vestibular \nschwannomas, intracranial and spinal meningiomas, gliomas, neurofibromas, and posterior \nsubcapsular lenticular opacities. On MRI, extracanalicular extension of vestibular schwannomas into the cerebellopontine angle \ncan lead to an \"ice cream cone\" appearance as shown below: Option C: Tuberous sclerosis is a multi-system neurocutaneous syndrome caused by the mutation \nof genes coding for hamartin (chromosome 9) and tuberin (chromosome 16), which leads to the \nformation of angiomyolipomas, cysts in kidneys, multiple hamartomas, giant cell astrocytomas, \nand cortical tubers.

Vein of Galen aneurysmal malformations (VGAM's), also known as median prosencephalic \narteriovenous fistula, are uncommon intracranial anomalies that tend to present in early \nchildhood with features of a left-to-right shunt and high-output cardiac failure. The vein of Galen, also known as the great cerebral vein or great vein of Galen, is a short trunk \nformed by the union of the two internal cerebral veins and basal veins of Rosenthal. It lies in the \nquadrigeminal cistern. It curves backwards and upward around the posterior border of the \nsplenium of the corpus callosum and drains the anterior and central regions of the brain into the \nsinuses of the posterior cerebral fossa.

      "explanation": "This patient's clinical features and T2W MRI of the brain showing periventricular ovoid \nhyperintense lesions oriented perpendicular to lateral ventricles, called Dawson's fingers, are \ncharacteristic of multiple sclerosis. Multiple sclerosis(MS) is an autoimmune demyelinating disease of the central nervous system \ncharacterized by inflammation, multiple demyelinating plaques, and relapsing and remitting \nsymptoms. 192 \nSold by @itachibot It is commonly associated with paresthesia (tingling sensations), hypesthesia (numbness), optic \nneuritis, unilateral/ bilateral, limb weakness - spastic paralysis, Babinski's sign positive and \nbladder dysfunction. Optic neuritis (ON) presents as diminished visual acuity or decreased colour \nperception (desaturation) in the central field of vision. MRI is used for making the diagnosis of MS due to its high sensitivity. The diagnosis of MS \nrequires demonstrating that the lesions are disseminated in space (involving multiple areas of the \nbrain) and in time (multiple episodes over a period of time). The MRI below demonstrates Dawson's fingers, the demyelinating plaques through the corpus \ncallosum, arranged at right angles along medullary veins (callososeptal location). Other options: Option A: A \"puff of smoke appearance\", derived from the Japanese term Moyamoya, is a \ncharacteristic finding on cerebral X-ray angiography in patients with Moyamoya disease. This \nrare, non-inflammatory, progressive, occlusive disease involves large intracranial \narteries exhibiting bimodal age distribution in the first and fourth decades. Childhood moyamoya \nis characterised by ischemic manifestations, and adult moyamoya by hemorrhagic manifestations. The below image shows the MR angiography findings in a patient with Moyamoya disease. 193 \nSold by @itachibot As this is a chronic condition, the lenticulostriate arteries develop a rich collateral circulation \naround the occlusive lesion, seen as a 'puff of smoke' (moyamoya in Japanese) on X-ray \nangiography as shown below: Option B: Metachromatic leukodystrophy is an autosomal-recessive disease resulting from a \ndeficiency of the lysosomal enzyme arylsulfatase A, causing central and peripheral demyelination, \nataxia, and dementia. Symmetric confluent areas of T2 hyperintensity are seen in the periventricular white matter. \nRadiating T2 hypointense lines through the demyelinated deep white matter represent the sparing \nof the perivascular white matter. This results in the tigroid and leopard skin patterns when \nimaged in the long axis or cross-section, respectively. Subcortical U-fibers are spared. The below \nMRI shows tigroid pattern: 194 \nSold by @itachibot Option D: Progressive supranuclear palsy is a neurodegenerative disease characterized by atrophy \nof structures at the midbrain-diencephalic junction (e.g., superior colliculi, red nuclei, \nsubthalamic nuclei, and globus pallidus) and cerebellum (dentate nuclei), and mild cortical \natrophy. MRI shows a hummingbird sign (atrophy of midbrain structures with a relatively intact \npons region). 195 \nSold by @itachibot Brain Tumors, Neurodegenerative & Demyelinating Disorders",
