      "correct_answer": "a",
      "explanation": "Ultrasonography (USG) works based on the principle of the piezoelectric effect. The tip of ultrasound transducer is made up of piezoelectric crystals like lead zirconate titanate. \nWhen electric current pass through the transducer, these crystals starts to vibrate and produces \nultrasound waves. This is called reverse piezoelectric effect. They propagate through different tissues and is reflected back. These waves are then converted \nback into electrical impulses by the transducer crystals. This is called piezoelectric effect. These \nimpulses are further processed to form an ultrasound image on the screen by pulse-echo principle. \nBoth reverse piezoelectric effect and piezoelectric effect are used in diagnostic ultrasound.",

      "correct_answer": "a",
      "explanation": "Bile is not echogenic on ultrasound. Echoes are not produced if there is no difference in acoustic density. Hence, homogeneous fluids \nare seen as echo-free structures. Examples of homogenous fluids include blood, bile, urine, cyst \ncontents, ascites, and pleural effusion. Homogenous fluids transmit sound exceptionally well and render increased echoes to those \nstructures deeper to them. This is called acoustic enhancement / posterior enhancement / \nenhanced through transmission. Acoustic shadowing is present behind bony structures, calculi, and air. The image given below shows posterior enhancement of a renal cyst. 28 \nSold by @itachibot The below image shows a gall bladder stone with acoustic shadowing.",

      "correct_answer": "c",
      "explanation": "The USG image represents the M-mode used for echocardiography. Echo intensity is represented \nas brightness and a trace is swept across the screen so that the x-axis represents time. Ultrasonography is a versatile imaging modality known for its portability and safety, particularly \nas it does not involve radiation exposure. As the safest radiological investigation for pregnancy, it \nprovides crucial information without posing any risks to the mother or fetus, making it \nindispensable in obstetric care. Different modes in USG and its uses are as follows: • A (amplitude) mode: Used in ophthalmology and orbital biometry (option A). • B (brightness) mode: Used for all routine applications, with brightness encoded as grayscale \nvalue (option B). • M (motion) mode: In echocardiography. HIFU (high-intensity focussed USG) is a therapeutic application of USG. It is useful for the \ntreatment of fibroids. HIFU exploits the thermal effects of high-powered, tightly focused \nultrasound beams so that very small target tissues can be heated and coagulated. The image below depicts a duplex scan, which is a combination of B-mode imaging and pulsed \nDoppler data acquisition. 29 \nSold by @itachibot Doppler ultrasound (option D) is used in diagnosing peripheral arterial disease. It uses a handheld \nDoppler ultrasound probe placed at an arterial site. A normal arterial wave has a triphasic signal. \nA triphasic wave has three waveforms consisting of a sharp systolic wave with a forward uprise \nand fall, a second wave with reverse flow occurring in diastole, and the last wave with a forward \nflow taking place during diastole. Doppler ultrasound can detect moving blood. However, it does not provide information on \nwhether the blood flow is sufficient for the maintenance of limb viability. The image below shows triphasic signal on doppler ultrasound:",

      "explanation": "The contrast agent used for MRI is gadolinium. It acts by reducing both T1 and T2 relaxation time \nof the tissue. The predominant effect is on T1, so post-contrast is a T1 weighted image. Since \ngadolinium ion is toxic, Gd-DTPA (Gadolinium diethylenetriamine penta-acetic acid) is used. Contraindications: • Renal failure - Gd-DTPA is predominantly excreted through the kidney. Hence, in renal failure, \nit gets accumulated in the body and releases gadolinium ions. Since the ion is toxic, the body tries \nto contain it by fibrosis resulting in multisystem painful fibrosis called nephrogenic systemic \nfibrosis.
