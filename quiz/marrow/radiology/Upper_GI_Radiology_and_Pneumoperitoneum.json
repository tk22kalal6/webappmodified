      "explanation": "In the given clinical scenario, a patient presenting with dysphagia and a corkscrew appearance of \nthe esophagus on barium swallow is suggestive of diffuse esophageal spasm. Diffuse esophageal spasm (DES) is a hypermotility disorder caused by spontaneous, abnormal \ncontractions seen primarily affecting the distal two-thirds of the esophageal body, with normal \ndeglutitive lower esophageal relaxation (LES) relaxation. These contractions are repetitive, \nsimultaneous, and of high amplitude, but normal peristalsis is preserved between the episodes. \nThis condition is seen most often in females. Patients typically present with dysphagia for both solids and liquids, retrosternal non-cardiac \nchest pain, and symptoms such as heartburn, regurgitation and the sensation of food being stuck \nin the throat. Although DES may present as a corkscrew or rosary bead esophagus on barium swallow, this \nfinding is uncommon. Manometry remains the gold-standard for diagnosis.",

Achalasia cardia is a primary esophageal motility disorder characterized by the absence of \nesophageal peristalsis and impaired relaxation of the lower esophageal sphincter (LES) in \nresponse to swallowing. On barium swallow, the hallmark bird beak or beak-like appearance is observed, resulting from \nesophageal dilatation above the constricted LES.

      "correct_answer": "a",
      "explanation": "A patient with the given history and barium swallow findings of irregular narrowing, mucosal \ndestruction, and shouldered margins of esophagus, are suggestive of carcinoma esophagus. Esophageal carcinoma is more common in men, with tobacco use and alcohol being the strongest \nrisk factors. The squamous cell carcinoma variant usually affects the upper 2/3rd, and the \nadenocarcinoma variant usually affects the lower 1/3rd of the esophagus. Clinical features include \nprogressive dysphagia (most common), regurgitation of food, vomiting, odynophagia and weight \nloss. On barium swallow, carcinoma esophagus presents with irregular narrowing and ulceration of \nesophagus. Flexible endoscopy with biopsy is preferred for confirmation of \ndiagnosis. Contrast-enhanced CT and PET can be used to assess distant metastasis. Endoscopic \nultrasonography (EUS) is the investigation of choice to assess tumor invasion and lymph node \nmetastasis. Other options: Option B: Diffuse esophageal spasm results in the corkscrew appearance of the esophagus on \nbarium study. Option C: Esophageal leiomyoma appears as a smooth, semilunar filling defect on barium \nswallow. it is seen as a discrete ovoid mass that is well outlined by barium.

Plummer-Vinson syndrome is also known as Paterson-Brown-Kelly syndrome. It commonly \naffects middle-aged women with long-standing anaemia, and is a recognized risk factor for \npost-cricoid hypopharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma. It consists of dysphagia, iron-deficiency \nanemia and esophageal webs or hypopharyngeal webs. Esophageal webs are due to a constriction caused by a thin mucosal membrane projecting into the \nlumen.

      "correct_answer": "a",
      "explanation": "The mucosal ring at the squamocolumnar junction of the distal esophagus is a B-ring. Distal esophageal rings are frequent findings on barium contrast X-ray studies. They are of two \ntypes: • B-ring - It occurs at the squamocolumnar junction or gastroesophageal junction. It is lined with \nsquamous epithelium above and columnar epithelium below. • A-ring - It occurs above the B-ring, i.e., a few centimetres proximal to the gastroesophageal \njunction. It represents a physiological contraction of esophageal smooth muscle covered by \nmucosa. A-rings are usually asymptomatic (option B). Schatzki ring, also called Schatzki-Gary ring, is a symptomatic narrow B-ring occurring in the \ndistal esophagus. It is usually associated with a hiatus hernia. 249 \nSold by @itachibot The below image is a barium study showing the Schatzki ring located at the gastroesophageal \njunction, suggestive of hiatus hernia. Other options: Option C: Esophageal webs are most common in the upper oesophagus (post-cricoid area), where \nthey are generally semi-circumferential, eccentric lesions that protrude less than 5 mm and have a \nthickness of 2 to 4 mm. Microscopically, webs are composed of fibrovascular connective tissue \nand overlying epithelium. The barium swallow below shows the oesophagal web in a patient with Plummer-Vinson \nsyndrome. Oesophagal webs are thin membranes of normal oesophagal tissue consisting of \nmucosa and submucosa. The translucent part denotes the oesophagal web. Option D: Esophageal stricture refers to any persistent intrinsic narrowing of the esophagus. The \ncauses are peptic stricture (esophagitis induced), corrosives (most common cause), foreign body, 250 \nSold by @itachibot post-surgical, radiotherapy, congenital, tuberculosis, and drugs like tetracycline. Radiographic features of benign strictures show smooth tapering with typical concentric \nnarrowing (may affect only one side of the esophagus) while malignant strictures are \ncharacteristically abrupt, asymmetric, and eccentric with irregular nodular mucosa. The barium \nstudy image below shows esophageal stricture.",

      "explanation": "The given upper GI series shows the collection of contrast in a posterior pharyngeal pouch-like \nstructure, which favors the diagnosis of Zenker's diverticulum. A barium swallow study may show a diverticulum arising from the midline of the posterior wall of \nthe distal pharynx near the pharyngoesophageal junction. The diverticulum is typically noted at \nthe C5-6 level. The outpouching may be transient, sometimes referred to as a pharyngeal pouch. \nThe pouch is best identified during swallowing and is best visualized on the lateral view. Since a majority of patients with a Zenker's diverticulum have a hiatal hernia and \ngastro-oesophageal reflux, the distal esophagus should also be evaluated. Note: Killian–Žamieson diverticulum is an outpouching from the lateral wall of the proximal \ncervical esophagus.",

These folds are 1-2 mm thick and run \nhorizontally around the entire circumference of the esophageal lumen. It is thought to be due to \nthe contraction of the muscularis mucosae of the esophagus. This results in the shortening of the 251 \nSold by @itachibot esophagus and the bunching up of the mucosa in the lumen. The appearance is almost always associated with active gastroesophageal reflux. The findings are \ntransient, seen following reflux and not during swallowing.

      "explanation": "The given barium meal study is showing string sign and mushroom sign is suggestive of \ncongenital hypertrophic pyloric stenosis (CHPS). Congenital (infantile) hypertrophic pyloric stenosis is a condition caused by hypertrophy of the \ncircular pyloric muscles of the stomach, leading to gastric outlet obstruction. It typically presents \nbetween 2 to 6 weeks of age with progressive, forceful, non-bilious vomiting immediately after \nfeeding.

      "explanation": "The depth of the gastric carcinoma is assessed by endoluminal ultrasound. In endoluminal ultrasonography, the transducer is usually attached to the tip of the instrument \ndistally, and five layers of the gastric wall may be identified, helping in assessing the depth of \ninvasion (T component of the staging) of cancer with more than 90% accuracy. 256 \nSold by @itachibot Pre-operative staging is done with contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CECT) of the \nabdominal/pelvis. The most important prognostic indicators in gastric cancer are - lymph node \ninvolvement and depth of tumor invasion. Endoluminal ultrasound and laparoscopic ultrasound \nare the most sensitive methods in pre-operative local staging of gastric cancer. Other options: Option A: Standard abdominal ultrasound can be used to investigate the stomach, but it is less \nsensitive than other modalities in gastric cancer. Option B: Barium meal radiology is now used less frequently due to advances in more sensitive \ndiagnostic tools like endoscopy and CT imaging with oral contrast, replacing contrast radiology in \ninvestigating gastric malignancies. However, CT remains less accurate in the T-staging of gastric \ncancer compared to endoluminal ultrasound. Option D: Laparoscopy is routine in the assessment of gastric cancer.

Duodenal atresia is the blockade of the duodenum due to the failure of recanalisation during \nembryonic development from its solid cord stage, leaving the duodenum partially or completely \nobstructed. It is often associated with trisomy 21/Down syndrome, prematurity, maternal \npolyhydramnios, cardiac malformations, and malformations of the hepatobiliary system. The range of anatomic variants includes duodenal stenosis, mucosal web with intact muscle wall \n(so-called windsock deformity), two ends separated by a fibrous cord, and complete separation \nwith a gap within the duodenum. On abdominal X-ray, the double bubble sign represents the dilatation of the stomach and \nproximal duodenum. This can often be detected prenatally via ultrasound but, if missed, neonates \ntypically present with bilious vomiting shortly after birth, as the obstruction is usually distal to the \nampulla of Vater.

In the below radiograph, the arrows are pointing to the Cupola sign seen in the \npneumoperitoneum. Signs of pneumoperitoneum: • Bowel-related signs • Double-wall sign/Rigler's sign/gas-relief sign • Telltale triangle sign/triangle sign - A triangle of gas formed between three loops of the bowel or \nbetween the abdominal wall and two loops of the bowel. • Peritoneal ligament-related signs • Football sign • Falciform ligament sign 259 \nSold by @itachibot • Lateral umbilical ligament sign/inverted \"V\" sign - Air outlines the lateral umbilical ligament • Urachus sign - Air outlines the urachus. • Right upper quadrant signs • Cupola sign • Fissure for ligamentum teres sign- Air outlines the ligamentum teres • Hepatic edge sign - Cigar-shaped free-air pocket in the subhepatic region. It tracks superomedial \nfollowing the contours of the liver • Lucent liver sign - Reduction of hepatic radiodensity due to accumulation of free gas anterior to \nthe liver • Morison's pouch sign/Doge cap sign - Triangular/ crescentic gas lucency bound by the 11th rib • Periportal free gas sign. Other options: Option C: The below image is a supine abdominal radiograph of a neonate with a large \npneumoperitoneum. It shows an oval lucency divided by the falciform ligament resulting in the \nso-called football sign. Option B: The below image is a supine abdominal radiograph is showing the presence of air in the \nbilateral subphrenic spaces and a linear density on the ventral surface of the liver (arrow). This is \nknown as the falciform ligament sign. 260 \nSold by @itachibot Option D: The image given below is an abdominal radiograph showing Rigler's sign seen in \npneumoperitoneum. Here both the inner and the outer walls of the bowel are visible.",

      "explanation": "The given chest X-ray image depicts Chilaiditi sign, characterized by the anterior interposition of \nthe colon between the liver and the right hemidiaphragm, which can mimic air under the \ndiaphragm, leading to pseudo-pneumoperitoneum. Chilaiditi sign is typically an incidental finding on imaging and is most often asymptomatic. \nHowever, when associated with symptoms such as abdominal pain and distension, it is referred to \nas Chilaiditi syndrome. An erect X-ray showing this sign may mislead clinicians into suspecting pneumoperitoneum, \nprompting unnecessary urgent surgical intervention, which is not required. To differentiate \nChilaiditi syndrome from true pneumoperitoneum, a contrast-enhanced CT or a left lateral \ndecubitus radiograph can be performed. In the left lateral decubitus view, distended colonic loops \nwith haustral markings will be visible, showing that the air is within the bowel and not in the \nperitoneal cavity. Other conditions with the Chilaiditi sign are curvilinear pulmonary collapse, distended viscus, \nomental fat, and apposition of gas-distended bowel loops mimicking the double-wall sign. 262 \nSold by @itachibot Below is the chest X-ray and CT showing the presence of herniated bowel loops under the \ndiaphragm. Other options: Option A: The CT scan of the abdomen and pelvis shows free intraperitoneal gas which is \nsuggestive of pneumoperitoneum. The presence of free intra-abdominal gas almost always \nindicates perforation of a hollow viscus. Free intraperitoneal gas is also detectable under the \nhemidiaphragm on an erect chest X-ray as given below. 263 \nSold by @itachibot Option B: The existence of extraluminal gas within the mediastinum is referred to as \npneumomediastinum. Gas may originate from the peritoneal cavity, lungs, trachea, central \nbronchi, oesophagus, or peritoneal cavity and travel to the neck or abdomen via the mediastinum. \nSpinnaker sign (also called angel wing sign) is a radiographic sign seen in neonates with \npneumomediastinum. The pressure from the collected gas displaces the two lobes of the thymic \ntissue upward and laterally from its normal position. This results in large, wedge-shaped opacities \non radiograph resembling the spinnaker headsails of a boat. Other signs of pneumomediastinum \nare the V sign of Naclerio and continuous diaphragm sign. Below is a chest X-ray showing spinnaker sign and CT showing the presence of \npneumomediastinum. 264 \nSold by @itachibot",

      "explanation": "The correct sequence to visualize regions in FAST is subxiphoid  right upper quadrant  left \nupper quadrant  suprapubic. Focussed assessment with sonography for trauma (FAST) is a non-invasive investigation that can \nbe performed rapidly in the emergency room. It helps identify an abnormal collection of fluid or \nblood. FAST is indicated in: • Haemodynamically unstable patients who had a blunt abdominal trauma • Patients who sustained penetrating abdominal trauma with no other indications for immediate \nlaparotomy (signs of hemodynamic instability, peritoneal irritation, peritoneal penetration, and \ngunshot wound with transperitoneal trajectory). Technique: • The patient is placed in a supine position. • With a 3.5-5.0 MHz convex transducer, the following regions are scanned: • Subxiphoid transverse view is used to assess pericardial effusion and left lobe liver injuries. • A longitudinal view of the right upper quadrant is used to assess right liver injuries, right kidney \ninjury, and Morison's pouch. • A longitudinal view of the left upper quadrant is used to assess splenic injury and left kidney \ninjury. • Transverse and longitudinal views of the suprapubic region are used to assess Douglas's bladder \nand pouch. An \"extended FAST or eFAST\" scan: Assess left and right thoracic views, in addition to the FAST \nassessed regions, to look for pneumothorax and hemothorax. 266 \nSold by @itachibot Lower GI Radiology",
