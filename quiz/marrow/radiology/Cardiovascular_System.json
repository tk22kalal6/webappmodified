      },
      "correct_answer": "a",
      "explanation": "Based on the clinical scenario and the X-ray showing a box-shaped cardiac silhouette caused by \nright atrial enlargement, this is typically seen in Ebstein's anomaly. 154 \nSold by @itachibot Ebstein anomaly is characterized by an abnormal tricuspid valve that is displaced downwards into \nthe right ventricle. Hence, a part of the right ventricle is now located above the tricuspid valve. \nThis is called atrialization of the ventricle. There can be associated tricuspid regurgitation with or \nwithout stenosis. X- ray findings depend on the degree to which the tricuspid valve is displaced downwards. The \nfeatures are an enlarged right atrium which causes severe right-sided cardiomegaly, giving rise to \na box-shaped cardiac shadow and pulmonary oligemia. Other options: Option B: Pulmonary stenosis, ventricular septal defect (VSD), aorta overriding the VSD and right \nventricular hypertrophy are the defining features of Tetralogy of Fallot, a cyanotic congenital heart \ndisease. X-ray findings show characteristic 'coeur-en-sabot' or boot-shaped heart. Option C: Pulmonary veins returning to the right atrium or systemic venous circulation instead of \nthe left atrium, define total anomalous pulmonary venous circulation, a congenital cardiac \nmalformation, with supracardiac variety being the most common. As a result, a large supracardiac \nshadow can be seen with normal cardiac shadow and gives a characteristic pattern of snowman \nappearance/ figure of 8 on chest X-ray. Option D: Failure of the embryonic common truncus arteriosus to divide into the aorta and \npulmonary artery characterises truncus arteriosus, a cyanotic congenital heart anomaly. A single \ngreat artery arises from the heart, supplying both the pulmonary and systemic circulation. This \ncondition is associated with pulmonary plethora, unlike tetralogy of Fallot and is characterised by \nthe sitting duck appearance of the heart on X-ray.",

The given images below show the mickey mouse sign (FV- femoral vein; FA- femoral artery; GSV- \ngreat saphenous vein). 163 \nSold by @itachibot Other options: Option B: String sign (of Kantor) on barium studies appears as a thin, thread-like stream of \ncontrast passing through the stenosed bowel segment, particularly in Crohn's disease. Option C: Tillaux sign is said to be positive if the mass/swelling is mobile perpendicular to the \nmesentery attachment line. Tillaux’s sign is seen in a mesenteric cyst. Option D: Stemmer's sign is the inability to tent the skin at the base of the toes due to skin \nthickening, as seen in lymphedema.",

      "explanation": "A thallium scan is performed to detect reversible myocardial ischemia. It evaluates myocardial \nperfusion both at rest and during stress (exercise/pharmacological). In reversible ischemia, a cold spot is seen during exercise or stress due to reduced perfusion, but \nnormal perfusion is observed at rest. Conversely, irreversible infarction is indicated by cold spot \nduring rest and stress/exercise. In technetium and pyrophosphate scanning, infarct appears as a hot spot. MUGA (multiple gated acquisition) scan is a nuclear imaging test that can evaluate the function of \nthe ventricles. It is used for informed diagnostic intervention in heart failure. Its specific uses are \nin evaluating the degree of myocardial damage following myocardial infarction and in assessing \ncardiac dysfunction in patients on cardiotoxic drugs like anthracyclines. 164 \nSold by @itachibot Congenital Neural Anomalies, Neurocutaneous Disorders & Cerebrovascular Disorders",
