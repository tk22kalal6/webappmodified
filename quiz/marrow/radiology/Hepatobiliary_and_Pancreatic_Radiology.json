      "correct_answer": "a",
      "explanation": "A patient presenting with abdominal pain and vomiting, with CT showing a Mercedes-Benz sign, \nis characteristic of cholelithiasis. Mercedes–Benz sign (triradiate sign), is seen when a gallstone contains central radiolucent gas. \nThe fissures may be tri-radiate or bi-radiate (seagull sign). These fissures appear dark on CT or \nradiographs, giving the sign its characteristic appearance. Gallbladder stones or cholelithiasis are the most common condition affecting the gallbladder. \nThey are often discovered incidentally and typically remain asymptomatic. However, they become \nsymptomatic when the stones obstruct the cystic duct. In such cases, patients may experience dull \nor colicky right upper quadrant or epigastric pain radiating to the back, along with symptoms like \nnausea and vomiting. Only about 10% of gallstones are radiopaque. Ultrasonography (USG) is the most accurate initial \nimaging modality of choice for the diagnosis of gallbladder stones. These stones appear as \nechogenic foci producing acoustic shadows. The sensitivity of USG for gallstones is &gt;95%. The CT image below depicts the Mercedes-Benz sign: The image below shows ultrasonography of the gall bladder. 304 \nSold by @itachibot",

      "explanation": "The given clinical scenario along with the CT showing gas within the wall of the gallbladder is \nsuggestive of emphysematous cholecystitis. Emphysematous cholecystitis is a rare form of acute cholecystitis where gallbladder wall necrosis \ncauses gas formation intramurally or intraluminally. This condition occurs most frequently in elderly males or patients with diabetes. Secondary \ninfection of the gallbladder wall with gas-forming organisms such as Clostridium welchii/ C. \nperfringens leads to emphysematous cholecystitis, and aerobes such as Escherichia coli may also \nbe isolated. Patients present with right upper quadrant pain, nausea, vomiting, and low-grade \nfever. Crepitus is present on physical examination. On imaging, the air is seen in the gallbladder wall and/or biliary ducts, in the absence of abnormal \ncommunication with the gastrointestinal tract is seen. Emphysematous cholecystitis has a high mortality rate due to the development of gangrene, \nperforation, and other complications. Hence, emergency cholecystectomy is indicated for the \nmanagement of these patients. 305 \nSold by @itachibot The given image shows a postoperative specimen of an emphysematous gallbladder along with an \nX-ray showing air in the gallbladder wall.",

      "explanation": "The clinical scenario along with the triangular cord sign on the USG is suggestive of biliary atresia. The triangular cord sign represents the fibrous ductal remnant of the extrahepatic bile duct in \nbiliary atresia. It is usually seen as an echogenicity along the anterior wall of the right portal \nvein. In the above image, the arrow represents the fibrous atretic plate at the porta hepatis. Biliary atresia may also be termed as noncystic obliterative cholangiopathy. It is a disease of the \nintra and extrahepatic bile ducts of unknown etiology. The classification of biliary atresia with the regions involved is as follows: Type I - Common bile duct Type IIa - Common hepatic duct Type IIb - Common bile duct, hepatic duct, cystic duct. Type III (most common type) - Common bile duct, hepatic duct, cystic duct; no anastomosable \nducts at porta hepatis. Clinical features include persistent jaundice, clay-colored stools, and hepatomegaly. Untreated \nnewborns will show signs of liver cirrhosis and failure (ascites, portal hypertension, and failure to \nthrive). Laboratory evaluation will show elevated levels of direct and indirect bilirubin, alkaline \nphosphatase, and gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase. Ultrasound will show hypoplastic or absent \ngallbladder and the triangular cord sign. The definitive diagnosis is by intraoperative \ncholangiography.

Adenomyomatous hyperplasia of the gall bladder is also known as cholecystitis glandularis \nproliferans. It is characterized by gall bladder wall thickening due to epithelial and smooth muscle \nhyperplasia along with cystic epithelial invagination into the wall, referred to as \nRokitansky-Aschoff sinuses. The most common location is in the fundus of the gall bladder and \nthe sinuses often contain stones. On USG, the characteristic findings are a thickened gallbladder wall showing bright echoes arising \nfrom the cystic spaces with ‘comet-tail’ ring-down artefacts, as seen in the image below. The \ncomet-tail artefact is caused by the cholesterol crystals trapped within the Rokitansky-Aschoff \nsinuses, causing reverberation (large number of reflected waves).",

The colon cut-off sign refers to the abrupt termination of the gas filling of the colon on the left \nside. The inflammation of acute pancreatitis may extend to the phrenicocolic ligament via the \ntransverse mesocolon, causing a functional spasm of the splenic flexure, resulting in the colon \ncut-off sign. Though originally described in abdominal radiographs, this sign has also been \ndemonstrated in contrast enema and computed tomography. Acute pancreatitis is a condition characterized by inflammatory damage to the pancreas, \npresenting clinically with epigastric pain radiating to the back, which is relieved by bending 309 \nSold by @itachibot forward, nausea, and vomiting. Some may also present with signs of bleeding into the fascial \nplanes, such as Cullen’s sign, Grey Turner’s sign, Fox sign, and Bryant’s sign (discolouration of the \nscrotum).

Acute hemorrhagic pancreatitis can present clinically with certain named signs like Cullen’s sign, \nGrey Turner’s sign, Fox sign, and Bryant’s sign (discolouration of the scrotum). Radiological signs in acute pancreatitis include colon cut-off sign, preserved renal halo sign, and \nsentinel loop sign (upper abdomen).

      "explanation": "The investigation of choice to assess prognosis in patients with acute pancreatitis is CECT. It is \nused to calculate the modified CT severity index. Plain erect chest x-ray and abdominal radiographs are not diagnostic of acute pancreatitis and can \nonly be used to rule out certain differentials. Contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CECT) is \nthe imaging investigation of choice, but may not always be needed. Various scoring systems are \nused to grade the severity of acute pancreatitis based on blood investigations and radiographic \nfindings. The optimal time for the performance of contrast-enhanced CT imaging in cases of acute \npancreatitis is more than 72 hours from the onset of symptoms.
