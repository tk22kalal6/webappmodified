      "explanation": "The above radiography used for visualizing the large bowel is a single-contrast barium enema. Single-contrast studies: Only a positive contrast like barium or gastrografin is used. This study can \nbe used to evaluate mechanical problems such as an obstruction or fistula. In suspected \nperforation, a single contrast with a water-soluble medium is preferred. The advantages of single-contrast studies include precise control of barium column, easier \nidentification of filling defects, and suitability for patients unable to swallow gas-forming tablets. Double-contrast studies: These studies use positive and negative contrast agents to increase the \nsensitivity of the examination. In these studies, thick barium coats the lumen, and effervescent \ntablets ingested distend the lumen with air. • Positive contrast: Barium or barium-like agents e.g., gastrografin • Negative contrast: Air or CO2 The advantages of the double-contrast studies include the \"see-through\" effect, which provides \nenhanced visualization of mucosal details and increased sensitivity for detecting mucosal \nirregularities. These studies also allow for better distention and separation of the bowel loops and \nalso better detection of small mucosal lesions, polyps, and ulcers.

      "correct_answer": "c",
      "explanation": "The given ultrasound abdomen depicts the target sign suggestive of intussusception. Intussusception occurs when a portion of the bowel is telescoped into an adjacent segment. The \nmost common location of intussusception is ileocolic. Clinically, it presents with cramping \nabdominal pain, palpable sausage-shaped abdominal mass, and passage of red currant jelly stools. A plain radiograph may show a meniscus sign, i.e. soft tissue mass contrasting the bowel that is \nair-filled. The target sign of intestinal intussusception, also known as the doughnut sign or bull's \neye sign, is a diagnostic feature observed on abdominal ultrasound. This appearance is due to \nconcentric alternating echogenic and hypoechogenic bands. The echogenic bands are formed by \nthe mucosa and muscularis, and the hypoechoic bands are formed by the submucosa. Other ultrasound signs of intussusception include: • Pseudokidney sign - This is seen in the longitudinal section of the bowel. The edematous bowel \nresembles renal parenchyma, and the mesentery, which is dragged into the intussusception, \nresembles renal hilum. • Crescent in a doughnut sign - A hyperechoic semilunar structure caused by mesenteric fat pulled \ninto the intussceptum.

      "correct_answer": "a",
      "explanation": "The CT image depicts the accordion sign seen in pseudomembranous colitis. Clostridium difficle infection (CDI) commonly caused by the disruption of the commensal colonic \nmicroflora, due to prolonged antimicrobial use, especially antibiotics like cephalosporins, \nampicillin, clindamycin, and fluoroquinolones. The more severe form of CDI is known as \npseudomembranous colitis (PMC). Toxigenic Clostridium difficile produces toxin A (an enterotoxin) and toxin B (a cytotoxin), \ndamaging the epithelial-cell barrier function and causing diarrhea and pseudomembrane \nformation, which initially appear as small whitish-yellow plaques and later coalesce to involve the \nentire colon wall. The patient also presents with fever, abdominal pain, and leukocytosis. On CT imaging, accordion sign, also referred to as concertina sign, may be seen. The terms \naccordion or concertina refer to a harmonica like a musical instrument. The thickened edematous \nbowel resembles the folds of an accordion. The hyperemic-enhancing mucosa stretched over the \nthickened submucosal folds produces this appearance. This is also seen when the contrast gets \ntrapped between edematous haustral folds and pseudomembranes of the colon. Accordion sign is typical for pseudomembranous colitis but can be also seen in ischemic colitis, \nAIDS-related colitis, and severe edema from cirrhosis. The CT image below depicts accordion sign:",

      "correct_answer": "a",
      "explanation": "The given clinical scenario of a 64-year-old man with severe abdominal pain, abdominal \ndistension, and obstipation along with the radiograph showing the coffee bean sign is likely to \nbe sigmoid volvulus. 283 \nSold by @itachibot It occurs when the sigmoid colon twists on the sigmoid mesocolon. A sigmoid volvulus can be differentiated from a cecal volvulus by swirl sign, location of the \nobstructed loop, and anatomical appendages. The apex of a sigmoid volvulus usually lies high on \nthe left side. The apex of a caecal volvulus may lie on the right side or extend to the left upper \nquadrant. The swirl sign in with sigmoid volvulus is located at the level of the pelvic brim while \nthe swirl in cecal volvulus is located in the right lower quadrant. Other options: Option C: Cecal volvulus is more common in females in the 4th to 5th decade. It is characterized \nby ischemia. Option D: Paralytic ileus occurs secondary to neuromuscular failure, leading to the failure of \ntransmission of peristaltic waves. It mainly occurs following laparotomy. A CT scan is more \naccurate for differentiating functional from mechanical obstruction. The image given below is an \nX-ray of the paralytic ileus showing gas-filled loops of the intestine with multiple fluid levels. 284 \nSold by @itachibot Differences between the small bowel and large bowel obstruction: Option B: Colonic diverticula are almost all false diverticula, i.e., mucosa herniating through a \ndefect in the muscularis layer, typically covered by overlying serosa (where present).

      "explanation": "In the given clinical scenario, an elderly man presenting with constipation, along with a barium \nenema image showing the \"bird of prey\" sign, is highly suggestive of sigmoid volvulus. This radiological sign, observed during the barium enema study, represents smooth tapered \nnarrowing at the point of torsion of the sigmoid colon, looking like a hooked beak. Sigmoid volvulus is a cause of large bowel obstruction and occurs when the sigmoid colon twists \non the sigmoid mesocolon. Symptoms include constipation, abdominal bloating, nausea, and/or \nvomiting. The onset may be acute or chronic. It occurs more commonly in patients with chronic 285 \nSold by @itachibot constipation. X- ray of the abdomen shows a large, dilated loop of the colon, often with a few air-fluid levels. \nSpecific signs include the coffee bean sign/bent inner tube sign, Frimann-Dahl sign(three dense \nlines converge towards the site of obstruction), and the absence of rectal gas. CT may reveal a \nlarge gas-filled loop without haustral markings, forming a closed-loop obstruction.",

      "explanation": "The given clinical scenario and the barium enema showing a dilated right colon, with a transition \nzone in the mid-descending colon, are together suggestive of Hirschsprung disease. The most important sign on barium enema is a sudden change of calibre from the narrow \naganglionic segment and dilated proximal bowel. Hirschsprung disease is characterized by aganglionosis (absence of ganglion cells) in the distal \ncolon and rectum. This may occur due to the failure of neuroblasts in neural crest cells to migrate \ninto bowel segments or the degeneration of already migrated neuroblasts. Hence, functional \nobstruction develops as a result of a spasm in the denervated colon. Clinical features typically include failure to pass meconium within the first 48 hours of life, \nabdominal distension, vomiting, and constipation. Hirschsprung disease may present with \nenterocolitis, a severe complication that can be life-threatening. There is a notable association \nbetween Hirschsprung disease and Down's syndrome. Water-soluble contrast enema is the initial investigation and diagnostic test of choice. It shows a \nnarrow aganglionic segment, a conical transition zone, and a dilated proximal bowel. Rectal \nbiopsy is the gold standard investigation. The image below shows dilated ganglionic and contracted aganglionic segments in Hirschsprung \ndisease:",

      "explanation": "A newborn presenting with respiratory distress shortly after birth, along with the chest X-ray \nshowing bowel loops in the thoracic cavity, is suggestive of congenital diaphragmatic hernia \n(CDH). 292 \nSold by @itachibot Normally, the pleuroperitoneal cavities separate by 8-10 weeks of gestation. CDH is due to a \nfailure to close the pleuroperitoneal canal in the developing fetus. This malformation allows the \nabdominal organs to push into the chest cavity, impairing lung development and function. The \nmost common type of CDH is a Bochdalek hernia, which usually involves the left side. Mortality is \npredominantly due to the development of pulmonary hypoplasia. Chest X-ray findings in congenital diaphragmatic hernia include: • Bowel loops in the thorax • Indistinct diaphragm with opacification of part of or all the hemithorax (typically left-sided) • Deviation of lines such as the endotracheal tube, nasogastric tube, umbilical arterial and venous \ncatheters. Given below is the chest radiograph of Bochdalek hernia. Given below is the chest radiograph of Morgagni hernia. 293 \nSold by @itachibot Note: Bag and mask ventilation is to be avoided in the management of this baby. Bag and mask \nventilation may increase abdominal distension and limit the expansion of the hypoplastic lungs. 294 \nSold by @itachibot Hepatobiliary and Pancreatic Radiology",
