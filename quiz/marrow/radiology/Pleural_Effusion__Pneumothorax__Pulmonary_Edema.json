      },
      "correct_answer": "a",
      "explanation": "Chest X-ray is most commonly performed in posteroanterior view (PA view) because it minimizes \nthe magnification of the cardiac silhouette. In PA view, the anterior structures are closer to the detector. It is usually done in full inspiration \nand standing position. Ideally, there should be no rotation. If there is no rotation the distance \nbetween the medial end of the clavicle and the spinous process will be equidistant, on both sides. \nIn a normal chest X-ray, the left dome of the diaphragm is lower than the right because the heart \npushes the left dome down. In anterior-to-posterior (AP) radiographs, the posterior structures are closer to the detector.

Marfan's syndrome is one of the causes for seconday spontaneous pneumothorax in adults. 92 \nSold by @itachibot Pneumothorax refers to the collection of air in the pleural space. Chest radiograph in spontaneous pneumothorax demonstrates: • Thin, sharp white line, demarcating the visceral pleural edge • Absence of lung markings seen peripheral to this line • Peripheral space radiolucent compared to adjacent lung • Complete lung collapse, as well as subcutaneous emphysema and pneumomediastinum, may be \nseen • Deep sulcus sign (on supine chest radiograph) Deep sulcus sign: On a supine position(common in the ICU), air collects anteriorly and basally, \nwithin the non-dependent portions of the pleural space, abnormally deepening the costophrenic \nangle.

M-mode is defined as the time-motion display of the ultrasound wave along a chosen ultrasound \nline. With M-Mode, even rapid motions can be displayed, measured and recorded. In a normal \nlung, the M-mode image demonstrates a linear, laminar pattern in the tissue superficial to the \npleural line and a granular or sandy appearance deep to the pleural line. The motionless portion of the chest above the pleural line creates horizontal ‘waves', and the \nsliding below the pleural line creates a granular pattern, the ‘sand’. The resultant picture is one \nthat resembles waves crashing in onto the sand and is therefore called the ‘seashore sign’ and is 95 \nSold by @itachibot present in a normal lung.

      "explanation": "96 \nSold by @itachibot The above M-mode ultrasound of the right lung shows a stratosphere or barcode sign specific for \npneumothorax. In a lung with pneumothorax, lung sliding is abolished on M-mode ultrasound, and the normal \nsand-like appearance beneath the pleural line (white line) is replaced by parallel lines, which is \ntermed the stratosphere or barcode sign, suggesting the presence of pneumothorax. The image given below shows the stratosphere sign or barcode sign. Supine chest radiography has low sensitivity for traumatic pneumothorax. Thoracic ultrasound \nhas high sensitivity and specificity for the detection of small or occult pneumothorax in critical \ncare patients. Other options: Option B: Pleural effusion on ultrasound appears anechoic with an echogenic line at the fluid-lung \ninterface if it is transudate. Exudative and hemorrhagic effusions may appear echogenic with \npleural thickening. The fluid shows movement and changes in shape with breathing, along with \nthe presence of septa and fibrous strands. Option C: Consolidation on ultrasound appears hypoechoic with heterogeneous echotexture. It is \nisoechoic with the liver and is referred to as lung hepatization.

      "explanation": "The given clinical scenario and radiograph showing a spinnaker sign is suggestive of \npneumomediastinum. Spinnaker sign (also called angel wing sign) is a radiographic sign seen in neonates \nwith pneumomediastinum. Pneumomediastinum is the presence of extraluminal gas within the \nmediastinum. The pressure from the collected gas displaces the two lobes of the thymic tissue 97 \nSold by @itachibot upward and laterally from its normal position. This results in large, wedge-shaped opacities on \nradiograph resembling the spinnaker headsails of a boat. This should be distinguished from a thymic sail sign which is a normal finding on a neonatal chest \nx-ray. It represents a physiologically enlarged thymus in a neonate. Other signs of pneumomediastinum are: • V sign of Naclerio - It is due to a V-shaped air collection. One limb of the V is produced by \nmediastinal air outlining the left lower lateral mediastinal border and the other limb is produced \nby air between the parietal pleura and medial left hemidiaphragm. • Continuous diaphragm sign - Normally the central portion of the diaphragm is not discretely \nvisualised on chest radiographs as it merges with the cardiac silhouette. If the diaphragm can be \nseen continuously across the midline then it is suggestive of free gas within the mediastinum.

      "explanation": "Lateral decubitus view is the best view to identify pleural effusion. It can identify as little as 25 \nml of pleural fluid. Features of chest radiograph in pleural effusion: • Presence of free pleural fluid • Blunting of costophrenic angle • Ellis-S curve – This is a radiological illusion and occurs as a medial radiological density due to \nthe presence of partially aerated lung between the anterior and posterior fluid layers, whereas \nlaterally the density is higher due to the presence of fluid only.

Causes for hypertranslucency/hypertransradiancy of hemithorax: • Increased rotation while taking chest X-ray (most common) • Scoliosis • Poliomyelitis • Mastectomy • Pneumothorax • Emphysema • Macleod syndrome (a complication of bronchiolitis characterized by a reduction in the \npulmonary vasculature and alveolar hyperdistention) • Poland syndrome (unilateral absence of pectoralis major +/- other chest muscles) • Pulmonary embolism Causes of opacification of a hemithorax: • Pneumonectomy • Pleural effusion • Consolidation • Collapse • Massive tumour • Fibrothorax • Lung agenesis",

      "correct_answer": "a",
      "explanation": "Kerley A lines radiate from the hilum of the lungs. Kerley lines are seen when the interlobular septa in the pulmonary interstitium become \nprominent. This may be because of lymphatic engorgement or edema of the connective tissues of the \ninterlobular septa. They usually occur when pulmonary capillary wedge pressure reaches 20-25 \nmmHg. Types of Kerley lines: 106 \nSold by @itachibot • Kerley A lines: • Thin, oblique lines(2-6cm long and thickness under 1mm), radiating from the hilum to the upper \nlobes. • HRCT is the most effective imaging technique to identify these lines. • Kerley B lines: • Thin, horizontal lines (1-2 cm long), seen at the lung periphery, usually near the bases. • Run perpendicular to the pleural surface and reach it, representing thickened subpleural \ninterlobular septa. • Kerley C lines : • Short, irregular lines with a spider web-like appearance. • Unlike Kerley B and D lines, they do not extend to the pleura; unlike Kerley A lines, they do not \nradiate outward from the hila. • Kerley D lines - the same as Kerley B lines, except that they are seen on lateral chest radiographs \nin the retrosternal air gap The image below depicts the Kerley B line, perpendicular to the pleural surface:",

      "explanation": "Bat-wing appearance is seen in pulmonary oedema. It is called so because of the bilateral opacities \nthat extend in a fan-shaped manner away from the hilum in a batwing pattern. Below is an image of a frontal chest X-ray and axial CT showing features of ‘batwing’ alveolar \npulmonary oedema. 107 \nSold by @itachibot Pulmonary oedema is defined as an abnormal accumulation of fluid in the extravascular \ncompartments of the lung. Features of pulmonary interstitial oedema - • Peri-bronchial cuffing and perihilar haze • Septal lines / Kerley lines • Thickening of interlobar fissures • Pulmonary venous engorgement - stag's antler sign • Airspace opacification classically in a batwing distribution • May have air bronchograms • Pleural effusions and fluid in interlobar fissures (including 'vanishing' pulmonary \npseudotumour) • Increased cardio-thoracic ratio / cardiac silhouette size (assessing for an underlying cardiogenic \ncause) The image below is a chest X-ray showing thickened interlobular septa (Kerley B) at the base of \nthe right lower lobe, bronchial wall thickening (cuffing), overall distended veins, and a small \npleural effusion with fluid in the interlobar fissures. 108 \nSold by @itachibot",

      "explanation": "The lung segment most commonly sequestered is the posterobasal segment of the left lower \nlobe. The majority of the sequestrations are located in left lower lobe. Pulmonary sequestration is a bronchopulmonary foregut malformation in which a segment or \nlobe of dysplastic lung tissue is disconnected from the rest of the tracheobronchial tree or \npulmonary arteries. It receives an anomalous vascular supply. It is a non-functional tissue. 109 \nSold by @itachibot Lung Infections, Sarcoidosis and Lung Cancer",
