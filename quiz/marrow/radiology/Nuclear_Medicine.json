      },
      "correct_answer": "d",
      "explanation": "PET or positron emission tomography is a nuclear medicine imaging technique that can be used \nfor hybrid imaging. That is, it can be combined with CT to allow a correlation between the \nmetabolic information (PET) and the cross-sectional anatomic information (CT). PET scanning measures the uptake of positron-emitting radioisotopes in the body, allowing us to \nvisualize the functional processes of the body. 3D images of tracer concentration within the body \nare then constructed by computer analysis. Hence, it provides metabolic and functional 403 \nSold by @itachibot information, unlike CT and MRI, as it is based on the principle that tumor cells generally have \nhigh metabolic activity compared with normal tissues. A glucose analogue called fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) is used in PET imaging. FDG is taken up by \nmetabolically active cells, where it undergoes phosphorylation to form FDG-6-phosphate. Unlike \nglucose, FDG-6-phosphate cannot undergo further metabolism and becomes trapped within the \ncell and this is detected by the PET scanner. Single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) is another similar imaging technique. The below imaging modality is a PET CT scan. PET \nSPECT Very expensive \nLower cost Usesgamma-emitting radiois \notopes (tracer) such asTc-99 \nm,I-123, I-131 Usespositron-emitting radioi \nsotope (tracer) like18F-FDG Better contrast and spatial re \nsolution Less contrast and spatial reso \nlution",

      },
      "correct_answer": "b",
      "explanation": "PET scans are based on the principle of production of a dual photon peak at 511 keV. To perform a PET scan, a radionuclide tracer (labeled to FDG molecules) is used. These molecules \ndecay in the body with the release of a positron. The positron travels a short distance and \nannihilates with an anti-particle (electron). This annihilation reaction results in the formation of \ntwo high-energy photons that travel in opposite directions. Each photon has an energy of 511 keV, \nmaking this a dual photon peak at 511 keV. 404 \nSold by @itachibot",

      "explanation": "PET involves the use of a radiolabelled bio-compound such as 2-fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose (FDG) \nwhich is injected intravenously. This compound is taken up and broken down in the cells. It is based on the principle that tumour cells have a high metabolic rate, and hence this compound \nis also metabolised by tumour cells. FDG is metabolised to FDG-6-phosphate which cannot be \nfurther metabolized by tumour cells. Hence it accumulates in tumour cells and can be measured \nand quantified. The applications of PET include: • Oncologic: • Detection, staging, drug response • Differentiation between radiation necrosis and recurrence • Neurologic: • Early diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease • Localisation of seizure focus in the interictal phase • Localising eloquent areas (e.g. speech, motor function) • Cardiac: Identification of hibernating myocardium",
