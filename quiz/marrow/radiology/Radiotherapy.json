      "explanation": "The Bragg peak effect is pronounced in protons. The proton is a heavy and charged particle that gradually loses its speed as it interacts with \nhuman tissue. It is easily controlled and delivers its maximum dose at a precise depth and can go \nas far as 32 cm. The absorbed dose increases very gradually with greater depth and lower speed, 388 \nSold by @itachibot suddenly rising to a peak when the proton is ultimately stopped. This is known as the Bragg peak. The behavior of the proton can be precisely determined, and the beam can be directed, allowing \nthe Bragg peak to occur within the tumor site. Immediately following this burst of energy, the \nprotons cease radiating and come to a complete stop. This property of proton therapy enables \ntargeting tumors within the body, delivering radiation directly to the tumor while sparing the \nsurrounding healthy cells, offering a much less invasive alternative to treat cancer.
