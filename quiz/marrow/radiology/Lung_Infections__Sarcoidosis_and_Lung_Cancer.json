      },
      "correct_answer": "b",
      "explanation": "A history of fever, cough, and chest X-ray showing opacities in the right middle lobe suggest \nconsolidation, describing a case of community-acquired pneumonia. Clinical features include acute onset fever, cough (with or without sputum production), and \nshortness of breath. In some cases, pleuritic chest pain, tachycardia, tachypnea, hypoxemia, or \nincreased work of breathing may be present on physical examination. A chest X-ray can be used to diagnose pneumonia. The presence of an infiltrate on a plain chest \nradiograph is considered the gold standard for diagnosing pneumonia. Radiographic findings \nconsistent with the diagnosis of CAP include lobar consolidations (along with air bronchograms \nwithin the opacity), interstitial infiltrates, and/or cavitations. A CT chest is used for better resolution or if the chest X-ray was non-diagnostic. Blood and \nsputum cultures are obtained to guide the antibiotic regimen. Other options: Option A: The radiological features of lung abscess include a thick-walled, irregular cavity \ncontaining an air-fluid level, often accompanied by surrounding pulmonary infiltrates. The cavity \ntypically forms an acute angle with the chest wall. Computed tomography (CT) is more sensitive \nthan chest radiography and is used to detect small cavities that may not be visible on standard \nX-rays. The accompanying X-ray image illustrates these features, showing thick-walled cavities with \nair-fluid levels on the lateral view: 122 \nSold by @itachibot Option C: Pleural effusion may present with dyspnea, pleuritic pain, dry cough, and associated \nsymptoms like fever, weight loss, oedema, and ascites depending on the aetiology. On \nexamination, there may be tachypnea, dullness on percussion and decreased/absent breath sounds \nat the base(s). The given X-ray image below shows left-sided pleural effusion: Option D: In pneumothorax, the patient will present with a history of breathlessness, and chest \nX-ray will show deep costophrenic angle, hyperlucency (darker area without lung markings) with \ninward shifting of the visceral pleural line (sharp white line). In tension pneumothorax, there will \nbe a mediastinal shift to the opposite side. The image below shows a left pneumothorax with total left lung collapse and tracheal deviation to \nthe right. 123 \nSold by @itachibot",

      "explanation": "This is a chest X-ray showing a bulging fissure sign. It is seen in Klebsiella pneumonia, \ntuberculosis, and carcinoma bronchus. A bulging fissure sign is seen in: • Klebsiella pneumonia (most common) • Legionella pneumonia • Streptococcal pneumonia • Tuberculosis • Yersinia pestis • Lung abscesses • Carcinoma bronchus It is seen due to the volume increase of the infected lobe or space-occupying lesions, displacing or \nbulging adjacent fissures of the affected lung. Features of pulmonary oedema include Kerley lines, thickened interlobar fissures, and transient \nloculated fluid collection in pleural or interlobar fissures, known as vanishing pulmonary \npseudotumour. This condition is typically seen in congestive heart failure and reflects a \ngeneralised fluid overload state that resolves with diuretics.",

      "explanation": "The marked finding is known as the Monod sign, which is seen in aspergilloma. It refers to the \npresence of gas surrounding a fungal mass within a pulmonary cavity. Aspergillomas (non-invasive pulmonary aspergillosis): Aspergillus fumigatus can cause mass-like \nfungus ball formation in structurally abnormal lungs (pre-existing cavities like in pulmonary \ntuberculosis). On Plain film and CT, an intracavitary mass surrounded by a crescent of air (Monod \nsign), is typically observed, as shown below. 131 \nSold by @itachibot Angioinvasive aspergillosis occurs primarily in immunocompromised patients. On HRCT, it is \ncharacterised by ground-glass opacity surrounding a pulmonary nodule or mass called a halo sign. \nThis sign indicates a haemorrhage. The below CT image depicts halo sign in invasive aspergillosis. Allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis (ABPA) is an immune reaction. The below image \ndepicts gloved finger appearance of ABPA in the left upper lobe. It is a characteristic sign of \nbronchocele. Other options: Option A: Blastomycosis is a chronic infection, characterized by the formation of suppurative and \ngranulomatous lesions, especially in the lungs and skin. The pulmonary disease resembles TB or \nhistoplasmosis. There can be focal or diffuse consolidation, miliary lesions, or abscess formation. Option B: A patient presenting with fever, breathlessness, and cough with expectoration is most \nlikely suffering from pneumonia. The CT image shows a sharply demarcated homogenous 132 \nSold by @itachibot consolidation that crosses segmental boundaries and involves only a single lobe, suggestive of \nlobar pneumonia. The below CT scan image is highly suggestive of pneumonia in which consolidation with an air \nbronchogram can be seen. Option D: Bronchiectasis is characterized by local and irreversible dilatation of bronchi. \nRadiographic findings are tramline appearance (seen on chest X-rays) and ring or curvilinear \nopacities on end-on appearance. CT shows bronchial dilatation and lack of tapering of the \nbronchial lumen (cardinal sign) and signet-ring sign (internal diameter of the bronchi is greater \nthan the adjacent pulmonary artery).

      "correct_answer": "c",
      "explanation": "In the above clinical scenario, the CT chest shows the comet-tail sign. It is seen in cases of round \natelectasis. Round atelectasis is a form of parenchymal collapse condition characterised by the infolding of a \nredundant pleura, resulting in a parenchymal collapse that can mimic a mass on imaging. The \ncomet-tail sign is produced by the distortion of bronchovascular bundles that appear pulled into \nthe collapsed area, resembling a comet tail. The most common cause of rounded atelectasis is occupational exposure to mineral dust: \nasbestos, pneumoconiosis, and mixed mineral dust. The image below shows round atelectasis associated with pleural thickening (comet-tail sign): 137 \nSold by @itachibot",

Bronchiectasis is a suppurative lung disease with abnormal and irreversible dilatation of the \nbronchi. Clinically, the patients present with a chronic productive cough, clubbing, crackles, and \nrhonchi. HRCT is the investigation of choice for bronchiectasis. The signet rings are as seen below:",
