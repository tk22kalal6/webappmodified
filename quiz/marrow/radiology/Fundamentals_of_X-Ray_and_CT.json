      "explanation": "MRI is a technique that produces topographic images by means of magnetic fields and \nradiofrequency waves. The ionizing radiations • Alpha • Beta 8 \nSold by @itachibot • Gamma • X-Rays The non-Ionizing radiations are: • Radiofrequency waves • UV rays • Microwaves Alpha and beta rays are particulate radiation (particles) whereas gamma and x-rays are \nelectromagnetic rays. All electromagnetic waves have a constant velocity of 3×108 m/s and no \nmass. The electromagnetic spectrum, from low frequency to high frequency consists of: Radiowaves &lt; Microwaves &lt; Infrared &lt; Visible light &lt; Ultraviolet &lt; X-rays &lt; Gamma \nrays Note: W. C. Roentgen is the father of X-ray and the first medical X-ray by Roentgen was of his \nwife Anna Bertha's left hand. Physicists Peter Mansfield and Paul Lauterbur developed \nMRI-related imaging techniques in medicine and they were awarded the Nobel prize in 2003.",

In routine films, both sides are coated, \nwhereas, in mammography, only one side of the film is coated. Note: X-ray films are most sensitive to blue light and least sensitive to red light. So, the safe light \nused in the darkroom is a red light. 9 \nSold by @itachibot",

      "correct_answer": "b",
      "explanation": "X-rays are produced when the electron beam decelerates close to the nucleus of the atom in the \nanode. The production of X-rays is as follows. Current is passed through a tungsten filament which acts as the cathode  Electrons are emitted as a result of thermionic emission  Electrons bombard the target anode, a tungsten disc  Results in the conversion of energy into heat (99%) and X-ray photons(1%) The target anode is made of a tungsten disc in ordinary diagnostic X-ray tubes and molybdenum \nin mammography X-ray tubes. At the anode, fast-moving electrons interact with the atoms of the anode in one of the following \nways: • Nucleus field interaction: aka continuous spectrum radiation or Bremsstrahlung reaction (80%) • Inner shell interaction: produces characteristic spectrum radiation (20%) 10 \nSold by @itachibot Important parameters with respect to X rays: • Kilovolt peak (kVP) – Potential difference between cathode and anode. When the voltage \nincreases, energy increases, and penetration also increases. Hence more kVP is required for obese \npatients. • Milliampere second (mAS) – Determines the amount of film blackening. More MAS more \nis radiation exposure. • Contrast is influenced by both kVP and mAS. • kVP is inversely proportional whereas mAS is directly proportional to the contrast produced.",

        "d": "Low energy incident photon and the inner shell electron"
      },
      "correct_answer": "d",
      "explanation": "The photoelectric effect is an interaction between a low to intermediate energy X-ray beam and \nthe inner shell electron. When the inner shell electron is ejected, the outer electron goes into the inner orbit to occupy the \nspace, and the extra energy is ejected as characteristic radiation, and is called the photoelectric \neffect. The photoelectric effect is fundamentally important in diagnostic radiography since it is the \nprimary method by which contrast is developed in radiographs. It allows for the differentiation of \ndifferent types of tissues on the X-ray film. 11 \nSold by @itachibot Very low-energy X-rays are not capable of producing the photoelectric effect. High energy X-rays \nare also not capable of photoelectric effect due to random scattering of electrons from the outer \nshell. This is known as the Compton effect and it can lead to distortion of the image. The goal of X-ray imaging should be to minimize the Compton effect and maximize the \nphotoelectric effect. The penetrating power of X-rays increases with increasing energy, which is \ndirectly proportional to the frequency and inversely proportional to the wavelength.",

Contrast containing iodine is used in CT, IVP, and angiography. Since all these imaging modalities \nare based on X-rays, iodine is used as it is radio-opaque. In contrast medium, iodine provides \nradio-opacity and the other elements act as carriers of iodine. These carriers increase the \nsolubility and decrease the toxicity of iodine.",

      "explanation": "Spiral CT is based on the technology called a slip ring. It is a device that distributes the power supply between the patient table (or couch) and the \ngantry, which contains the spinning X-ray tube. The slip ring makes the simultaneous movement \nof the patient and X-ray tube rotation possible. The process of CT imaging is faster, and the entire \ntrunk can be taken in a single breath-hold. Thus, there is no respiratory misregistration. Also in \nspiral CT, 3D reconstruction can be done. A spiral CT is the investigation of choice for renal stones. It is also used for staging of colon cancer \nand for visualization of pulmonary embolism. Radiation exposure: • CT abdomen = 500 chest X-rays (highest) • CT head = 100 to 150 chest X-rays • Mammography = 20 to 25 chest X-rays.",

Cardiac CT is done in CAD and for coronary calcium scoring. Coronary calcium scoring denotes \nthe degree of atherosclerosis and determines prognosis in patients with coronary artery disease. 14 \nSold by @itachibot It is an example of multi-slice CT or multidetector CT (MDCT).
