      "correct_answer": "b",
      "explanation": "The given case scenario is suggestive of molar pregnancy. The diagnosis is confirmed by \nultrasound, which shows a snowstorm appearance. Molar pregnancy is of two types: • Complete mole appears as an echogenic uterine mass with numerous anechoic cystic spaces but \nwithout a fetus or amnionic sac. The appearance is described as a 'snowstorm' appearance. Theca \nlutein cysts may be seen in the ovary. • In partial mole, the fetus is present along with molar components. The patient presents with a characteristic history of abdominal pain, vaginal bleeding or spotting, \nand vomiting during the first trimester. Also, there may be a history of passing grape-like vesicles \nvaginally. The snowstorm appearance on USG, combined with a raised hCG and a uterus larger than the \ndate of pregnancy, leads to the diagnosis of a complete hydatidiform mole. 369 \nSold by @itachibot Suction and evacuation is the treatment of choice. Serum hCG levels are checked within 48 hours \nof evacuation and are used as a baseline for future comparisons. It is then checked every week \nuntil it normalizes, which usually takes 4 to 8 weeks. After the hCG values return to normal, a \nregular follow-up is done monthly for 6 months.",

      "correct_answer": "a",
      "explanation": "The given T2 MRI image shows the racing car appearance, which is seen in agenesis of the corpus \ncallosum. This sign refers to the widely spaced lateral ventricles with intervening Probst \nbundles(white matter tracts that are no longer able to cross the midline in the corpus callosum). Appearances on axial MRI or CT resemble a Formula One car seen from above. The front tyres are \nrepresented by the widely spaced frontal horns anteriorly. The back tyres are represented by the \ndilated trigones seen posteriorly, which is also known as colpocephaly. The image given below shows the racing car sign in corpus callosal agensis. Other options: Option B: Marchiafava - Bignami disease is a rare condition characterized by demyelination of the \ncorpus callosum most often in patients with chronic alcoholism. The MRI image in this condition \nshows the sandwich sign. 370 \nSold by @itachibot Option C: Metachromatic leukodystrophy is an autosomal-recessive disease that results from a \ndeficiency of the lysosomal enzyme arylsulfatase A. Symmetric confluent areas of T2 \nhyperintensity are seen in the periventricular white matter. Radiating T2 hypointense lines \nthrough the demyelinated deep white matter represent the sparing of the perivascular white \nmatter. This results in the tigroid and leopard skin patterns when imaged in the long axis or \ncross-section, respectively. Subcortical U-fibers are spared. Option D: The most common site of lipoma in the brain is the peri-callosal region. The CT below \nshows bracket calcification of lipoma and is called bracket sign. 371 \nSold by @itachibot",

      "correct_answer": "a",
      "explanation": "Frog-eye sign in the ultrasound is suggestive of Anencephaly. Anencephaly is an open defect in the calvaria and skin that results from incomplete closure of the \nneural tube. It is one of the earliest detectable congenital defects that can be detected as early as \n10 to 11 weeks of gestation. Screening for anencephaly reveals increased levels of maternal serum \nalpha-fetoprotein (MSAFP). Diagnosis is confirmed by sonography. The following are the \nradiological signs seen in anencephaly: • Frog eye sign - Absence of cranial calvaria, causing prominent orbits, thereby resembling the \nface of a frog. • Shower cap sign - The absence of the cranium could lead to the protrusion of a disorganized \nmass of brain tissue. This resembles a shower cap, giving rise to a characteristic triangular facial \nappearance. The images given below show open calvaria on antenatal ultrasound and a 'shower cap' sign. 372 \nSold by @itachibot Option B - Eye of tiger sign is the MRI finding seen in Hallervorden-Spatz syndrome, a rare \nautosomal recessive neurogenerative disorder, showing decreased T2 signal in globus pallidus and \nsubstania nigra. 373 \nSold by @itachibot Note: Anencephaly, holoprosencephaly and ventral wall defects (e.g. ectopia cordis, omphalocele, \nbladder extrophy) have a very high rate of detection in the first trimester.

      "correct_answer": "b",
      "explanation": "The pelvic ultrasound in a 35-year-old woman shows the 'T-sign' seen in a monochorionic twin \npregnancy. In monochorionic pregnancy, the chorion does not extend between the layers of the intertwin \nmembrane. Thus, the inter-twin membrane comes to an abrupt halt in a T-configuration at the \nedge of the amniotic sac. In contrast, in a dichorionic pregnancy, the sonographic image depicts a 'twin-peak' sign or the \n'lambda sign\" as the chorion is present between the intertwin membrane. A triangular portion of \nthe placenta is seen inserted between the amniochorion layers. The type of twin pregnancy is best diagnosed by transabdominal ultrasound at 11-14 weeks of \ngestation as the chorion and amnion are not yet fused. At 11-14 weeks, the intervening membranes \nare clearly visualized at the site of insertion of the amniotic membrane into the placenta. If not \nvisualised transabdominally, transvaginal ultrasound is done.

A condom is placed on the transducer before the TVS transducer is inserted into the vagina. It \nprovides higher-resolution images compared to transabdominal USG because of the proximity to \nthe pelvic organs. During a transabdominal ultrasound, the bladder should be full to create a good \necho window. Indications of TVS include early pregnancy, LUS in late pregnancy, ectopic, pelvic masses, obese \npatients, follicular and endometrial studies, doppler examination of pelvic organs and \ninterventional procedures.",

      "explanation": "The image given is of the findings seen in hysterosalpingography. The given image shows bilateral \nretort-shaped fallopian tubes, indicating bilateral hydrosalpinx. Hysterosalpingography (HSG) is a technique used for visualization of the uterine cavity and \nfallopian tubes by the injection of a radioopaque dye, and visualization of the dye by fluoroscopy \nas it passes through the uterine cavity and fallopian tubes. It is best performed between the end of the menstrual period and ovulation (i.e. 9th or 10th day of \nthe cycle). 10-15ml of the dye is injected using a Leech-Wilkinson cannula, Rubin's cannula, or \nFoley's catheter. If the tubes are patent, the dye will spill out of the tubal Ostia and smear the 376 \nSold by @itachibot adjacent bowel. It is used to detect: • Tubal block: This can be due to strictures (fibrotic block), inspissated amorphous material, or \nspasms. The tubal spasm can occur in an apprehensive woman, and this is prevented by \npremedication with atropine and analgesia. • Uterine anomalies • Uterine polyps • Uterine synechiae • The feasibility of tuboplasty, by studying the location and extent of tubal pathology. Contradictions: • Presence of genital tract infection and bleeding • Genital tuberculosis, due to the risk of spreading infection. • Suspected pregnancy • Allergy to the dye • Premenstrual phase (there is a risk of embolism and endometriosis if HSG is done during this \nphase). The image given below shows the appearance of a normal hysterosalpingogram. Laparoscopic chromopertubation is a laparoscopic procedure for establishing the patency of \nfallopian tubes or verifying the findings of blocked tubes on HSG. Methylene blue is injected \nthrough the cervix to visualize the free spill. The absence of spill indicates blocked tubes.",

As gestation increases, \nthere is a gradual fall in all the resistance indices, so the amount of forward diastolic flow \nincreases. S/D ratio decreases as the period of gestation increases (S represents the peak systolic \nflow or velocity, and D indicates the end-diastolic flow or velocity). Abnormal flow patterns in the umbilical artery: • Reduced end-diastolic flow: Uteroplacental insufficiency. • Absent end-diastolic flow: Fetal compromise (terminate the pregnancy by cesarean section if \ngestational age is &gt;34 weeks). • Reverse end-diastolic flow: Impending doom of death (terminate pregnancy irrespective of \ngestational age). Middle cerebral artery: This will show increased diastolic velocity in fetus with hypoxemia.",

Spina bifida is the common open neural tube defect associated with hydrocephalus and \nArnold-Chiari II malformation. It is the most common open neural tube disorder. Spina bifida is \ncharacterized by a cleft in the vertebral column with a corresponding defect in the skin so that the \nmeninges and spinal cord are exposed. 378 \nSold by @itachibot The 3 main types of spina bifida: • Spina bifida occulta - This is the mildest form of spina bifida. The defect in the vertebral arches \nis covered by the skin. The splits in the vertebrae are so small that the spinal cord does not \nprotrude. The skin at the site of the lesion may be normal, or it may have some hair growing from \nit. • Meningocele - The defect in the vertebra allows the meninges to protrude through the defect. • Myelomeningocele (meningomyelocele) - A defect in the vertebral column allows the spinal cord \nwith the meningeal coverings to protrude. The lemon sign is related to changes in the configuration of the fetal frontal bone, which loses \nconvexity and appears concave or linear on ultrasonography; this sign can be detected during the \nfirst six months of gestation. The banana sign is another sign that is seen in spina bifida associated with Arnold-Chiari II \nmalformation. Herniation of the brainstem and cerebellar tonsils occurs through the foramen \nmagnum, with the cerebellum surrounding the brainstem, thus giving rise to the appearance of \nthe curved shape of a banana. Other options: Option B: Anencephaly is characterized by an open defect in the calvaria and skin, such that the \ncranial neural tube is exposed. It is a severe defect and is not compatible with survival. Frog eye \nsign is seen in USG. Prominent orbits (arrows) and an absence of cerebral tissue more cranially \nare seen. Option C: Holoprosencephaly is a rare congenital brain malformation resulting from incomplete \nseparation of the two hemispheres. On antenatal ultrasound, there may be also evidence of \npolyhydramnios, and the snake-under-the-skull sign may also be seen. Option D: Omphalocele is a midline anterior abdominal wall defect through which the solid \nabdominal viscera and/or bowel may herniate. The extruded abdominal contents are covered in a \nsac.
