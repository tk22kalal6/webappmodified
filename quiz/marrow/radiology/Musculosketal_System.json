      "explanation": "The X-ray shows a champagne glass pelvis and is suggestive of achondroplasia. Achondroplasia is a genetic disorder resulting in proximal limb shortening (rhizomelic dwarfism). \nIt is the most common cause of disproportionate dwarfism. The iliac blades are flattened giving \nrise to a pelvic inlet that resembles a champagne glass. The acetabular angles are flattened \n(horizontal) and the sacrosciatic notch is small. The image below shows a patient with achondroplasia - 59 \nSold by @itachibot Other options: Option A: Perthe's disease is characterized by a flattened and later, fragmented femoral head. Option B: Hip dysplasia usually presents with hip dislocation. Option C: Slipped capital femoral epiphysis (SCFE) presents with the metaphysis being displaced \nlaterally and not overlapping the posterior lip of the acetabulum as it should normally.",

It can also happen after a \nfall on the flexed, adducted arm, either by a direct blow to the front of the shoulder or due to a fall \non the outstretched hand. There is internal rotation of humeral head which causes changes to the normal radiographic \ncontour of the head of the humerus.

Another type is dorsal Barton's fracture which results due to fracture-dislocation of the dorsal rim \nof the radius. 68 \nSold by @itachibot The image below shows the lateral and anterior-posterior view of the dorsal-type of Barton's \nfracture with dorsal displacement. 69 \nSold by @itachibot",

      "explanation": "The given scenario of a patient with hip pain on chronic glucocorticoid therapy, with \nnon-significant findings on radiographs and exam, is suggestive of avascular necrosis (AVN) of the \nfemoral head. The best imaging modality for this is MRI. Long-term steroid usage is a risk factor for the development of AVN. MRI allows the identification \nof avascular necrosis of the femoral head in earlier stages and also helps determine the exact stage \nand extent of the pathologic process. The X-ray below shows flattening of the femoral head and degenerative changes associated with \nosteonecrosis or AVN. 75 \nSold by @itachibot The radiographic appearance of avascular necrosis of the femoral head may show the following \nchanges: • Sclerosis of the femoral head • Flattening or loss of sphericity of femoral head • Crescent sign - subchondral fracture overlying the necrotic segment of the femoral head • In severe stages, it may show femoral head collapse and arthritic changes in the joint",
