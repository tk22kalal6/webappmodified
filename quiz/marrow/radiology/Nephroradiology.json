The image below shows both kidneys appearing rotated, with the bilateral pelvicalyceal systems \noriented end-on. Additionally, the lower poles of both the kidneys are directed medially towards \nthe spine, as depicted in the accompanying image. 335 \nSold by @itachibot Horseshoe kidney results from the fusion of two functional kidneys located on either side of the \nmidline, typically connected by an isthmus composed of either functional renal parenchyma or \nfibrous tissue. In most cases, the fusion occurs at lower poles. The ascent of the horseshoe kidney is halted by the inferior mesenteric artery, which prevents it \nfrom reaching the normal level of T12- L3. Consequently, the kidney remains lower in the \nabdomen, making it more susceptible to complications such as reflux, obstruction, and stone \nformation. The following image shows horseshoe kidneys on abdominal CT: Note: When both upper and lower poles are fused, it is termed a discoid kidney.",

      "correct_answer": "c",
      "explanation": "Non-visualization of the kidney on IVP is seen in the case of multicystic dysplastic kidney \n(MCDK). MCDK is a form of renal dysplasia characterized by multiple, non-communicating cysts of varying \nsizes, separated by dysplastic parenchyma, with the absence of a normal pelvicalyceal system. It \nresults from a developmental abnormality due to failure of the renal mesenchyme to unite with \nthe ureteric bud. This condition is associated with ureteral or ureteropelvic atresia, and the \naffected kidney is non-functional. Most cases of MCDK are detected antenatally through ultrasonography. In some cases, the cysts \nidentified prenatally may regress in utero, resulting in the affected kidney being undetectable on \nimaging at birth. Renal ultrasonography is the initial investigation of choice. It reveals a soap \nbubble appearance. Bilateral MCDK can lead to pulmonary hypoplasia and Potter syndrome. The following image shows a non-visualized right kidney (red arrow). 336 \nSold by @itachibot Other options: Option A: In the duplicated collecting system, the drooping lily sign is seen. It refers to the \ninferolateral displacement of the opacified lower pole moiety due to an obstructed (and \nun-opacified) upper pole moiety. Option B: In polycystic kidney disease, a streaky appearance is seen due to ectatic collecting ducts. Option D: In renal hypoplasia, there is a congenitally small kidney with smaller calyces, lobules, \nand papillae but essentially normal residual parenchyma. On imaging, a hypoplastic kidney is \nsmall but otherwise normal.",

        "d": "Retrocaval ureter"
      },
      "correct_answer": "c",
      "explanation": "The given intravenous urogram shows the inferolateral displacement of the opacified lower pole \ndue to an obstructed (and unopacified) upper pole, referred to as the drooping lily sign, observed \nin patients with a duplicated collecting system. The duplicated collecting system is a common congenital anomaly of the urinary tract \ncharacterized by an incomplete fusion of upper and lower pole moieties resulting in a variety of \ncomplete or incomplete duplications of the collecting system. It occurs due to the division of the \nureter as it ascends upwards from the bladder to the renal parenchyma during the embryological \nperiod of life. As a result, the affected individual may have two collecting systems for one kidney. Duplex collecting systems may also be complicated by vesicoureteric reflux, obstruction or \nureterocoele. When the upper pole ureter is obstructed, the lower pole collecting system appears \ndisplaced and stretched on imaging, creating the \"drooping lily\" sign observed in intravenous \nurography. The Weigert-Meyer law describes the relationship of the upper and lower renal moieties in \nduplicated collecting systems to their drainage. When there are abnormalities associated with \nduplicating collecting systems, • The upper pole moiety drains inferomedially and is most commonly associated with obstruction. 337 \nSold by @itachibot • The lower pole moiety drains superolaterally and is most commonly associated with \nvesicoureteral reflux. The illustration given below shows the Weigert-Meyer law.",

      "explanation": "The clinical scenario, along with the CT scan showing an enlarged kidney with areas of necrosis \nand mottled areas of gas collection, is suggestive of left-sided emphysematous pyelonephritis. Emphysematous pyelonephritis is a severe, acute, necrotizing infection of the kidney caused by \ngas-producing organisms. It predominantly affects diabetic patients who are particularly \nsusceptible due to their hyperglycemic state, which promotes bacterial growth and fermentation. \nThe most common causative organism is Escherichia coli, which ferments sugar to produce \ncarbon dioxide, leading to gas accumulation within renal parenchyma or perinephric tissues. Less \ncommonly, organisms like Klebsiella and Proteus species can also cause this condition. Almost all patients present with fever, vomiting and flank pain. Patients frequently present with \nsepsis and ketoacidosis. If not treated early, it may lead to fulminant sepsis and is associated with \nhigh mortality. The diagnosis is primarily established radiographically, with a CT scan being the investigation of \nchoice in identifying the extent of the emphysematous process and guiding management.

      "correct_answer": "a",
      "explanation": "Moth-eaten calyces are the earliest finding in a patient with genitourinary tuberculosis, seen on \nintravenous pyelography. It refers to the ragged, feathery calyceal outline due to irregular erosions \nof the calyx. This appearance is due to necrotizing papillitis, which further progresses to form medullary \ncavities that eventually communicate with the collecting system. Genitourinary tuberculosis is caused by the dissemination of the organism through the \nbloodstream and is thus, always a secondary TB. There is either reinfection or reactivation of old \nTB. It can affect the kidneys, ureters, urinary bladder, prostate, seminal vesicles, epididymis, and 340 \nSold by @itachibot vas deferens. Lesions caused by tuberculosis in the kidney include: • Papillary ulcer - earliest lesion. • Pyonephrosis - caused by multiple scattered papillary ulcers undergoing caseous necrosis, which \nlater become filled with pus. • Perinephric abscess - by extension of pyonephrosis or tuberculous renal abscess. • Pseudocalculi - occurs when calcium gets deposited in a papillary ulcer healed with fibrosis. • Ghost calyces - caused by the destruction of the calyces. • Putty/cement kidney: Amorphous dystrophic calcification eventually involves the entire kidney \n(seen in X-ray and CT).

      "correct_answer": "a",
      "explanation": "Sterile pyuria in a patient with history of tuberculosis raises suspicion of renal tuberculosis. The \nmost sensitive imaging modality for diagnosing renal tuberculosis is CT Intravenous Pyelogram. Renal tuberculosis occurs due to hematogenous dissemination of Mycobacterium tuberculosis, \nmaking it a secondary infection. There is either reinfection or reactivation of old TB. It is more \ncommon in males and typically presents with symptoms such as increased urinary frequency, \npolyuria, dysuria, hematuria, loin pain/suprapubic pain and sterile pyuria. In sterile pyuria, urine appears pale and opalescent due to the presence of pus cells. Renal TB is a \ncause of sterile pyuria. Diagnosis is confirmed with a tuberculin test, or at least 3 consecutive \nearly-morning urine specimens are examined for acid-fast bacilli. They are stained with a \nZiehl–Neelsen stain and subsequently cultured. The most sensitive imaging modality in renal tuberculosis is CT urography/pyelography. NCCT is \nthe preferred means of visualizing renal calcifications. Manifestations of renal TB as seen on CT \nare as follows: • Early changes: • Papillary necrosis (single or multiple) and uneven caliectasis • Progressive changes: • Multifocal strictures in any part of the collecting system • Generalized or focal hydronephrosis • Mural thickening and enhancement • Poorly enhancing renal parenchyma, either due to direct involvement or due to hydronephrosis • End-stage: 342 \nSold by @itachibot • Progressive hydronephrosis results in very thin parenchyma, mimicking multiple thin-walled \ncysts • Amorphous dystrophic calcification eventually involves the entire kidney (known as the putty \nkidney), as shown below:",

This is seen in patients with severe neurogenic \nbladder and increased sphincter tone. Neurogenic bladder is a term applied to a dysfunctional urinary bladder that results from an \ninjury to the central or peripheral nerves that control and regulate urination. It causes detrusor \nsphincter dyssynergia. Neurogenic bladder typically occurs due to suprasacral lesions (above \nS2-S4) or apical lesions (in and around S2-S4).

As such, the diagnosis is first suspected after a UTI in a very young \nchild or recurrent UTIs. USG may reveal abnormalities like hydronephrosis and dilated \nureters. VCUG must be performed in such children before the age of 6 years to look for: • Presence and grade of VUR. • Whether reflux occurs during micturition or bladder filling. • Presence of associated anatomical anomalies.

The treatment of simple ureteroceles is surgical excision with re-implantation of the ureter. 362 \nSold by @itachibot OBG radiology",
