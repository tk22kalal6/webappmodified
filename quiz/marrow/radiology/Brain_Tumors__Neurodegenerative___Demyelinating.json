      "correct_answer": "d",
      "explanation": "The given MRI of the brain demonstrates a craniopharyngioma, which is a suprasellar tumour \nthat arises from remnants of Rathke's pouch. The two variants of craniopharyngioma are: • Adamantinomatous type (common in children): Predominantly solid with cystic components. \nDiagnostic features include compact lamellar keratin (\"wet keratin\") and areas of dystrophic \ncalcification. • Papillary type (common in adults): Contains both solid sheets and papillae lined by \nwell-differentiated non-keratinized squamous epithelium. These tumours are usually large and heterogeneous, displaying solid and cystic components. The \ncysts contain a cholesterol-rich, thick brownish-yellow fluid that is compared to 'machine oil'. Clinical features include headaches (most common), visual abnormalities - decreased acuity \nand bitemporal hemianopia, GH deficiency, growth failure, delayed sexual maturation due to \npituitary hypofunction, and polyuria (central diabetes insipidus). Radiologically: • CT may show calcifications associated with the solid and cystic wall components • MRI is the imaging modality of choice which shows: Craniopharyngiomas tend not to expand the pituitary fossa unless they become huge, which is a \ndifferentiating feature from pituitary macroadenomas. Other options: Option A: Pituitary apoplexy is an acute clinical condition associated with the rapid expansion of \nthe pituitary gland, which is evident on an MRI as enhancement around a non-enhancing \ninfarcted centre. Option B: Pituitary macroadenoma (with cystic degeneration or necrosis) shows indentation at the \ndiaphragma sellae, giving rise to a snowman/figure of eight appearance/cottage loaf.

      "correct_answer": "b",
      "explanation": "The given MRI is suggestive of medulloblastomas. It is the most common malignant brain tumor \nof childhood, and it occurs exclusively in the cerebellum. Irrespective of their histological or \ngenetic characterization, medulloblastomas correspond histologically to WHO grade IV tumors. Radiological findings include: • CT &amp; MRI: CT shows a hyperdense midline vermian mass adjoining the roof of the 4th \nventricle and causing hydrocephalus. MRI shows T2 hypointensity or isointensity compared to the \ngrey matter. The CT and MRI findings also reflect the increased nuclear-to-cytoplasmic ratio and \ndensely packed cells of the tumor. • DWI: restricted diffusion • MR spectroscopy: reduced N-acetyl aspartate(NAA) peak with an increased choline-to-creatine \nratio. The CT and MRI findings, supported by the presence of restricted diffusion on DWI, are the most \nreliable observations in differentiating medulloblastoma from ependymoma or other posterior \nfossa tumors. Standard treatment for medulloblastomas includes surgical resection, with adjuvant craniospinal \nradiotherapy for those over 3 years of age and chemotherapy. Other options: 215 \nSold by @itachibot Option A: Pilocytic astrocytoma is a brain tumor that occurs more often in children and young \nadults. These tumors are usually slow-growing and benign. The majority of neoplasms are located \nin the cerebellum. However, they can also appear around the third ventricle, optic nerves, spinal \ncord, and occasionally in the cerebral hemispheres. Mural nodule, a contrast medium enhancing \nnodule within the wall of a cystic mass, is seen on MRI. Option C: Ependymomas are tumours that arise from the ependyma-lined ventricular system, \ntypically on the floor of the fourth ventricle. In adults, the spinal cord is their most common \nlocation; tumors in this site are particularly frequent in the setting of neurofibromatosis type 2. \nThey are well-demarcated lobulated mass lesions that show calcifications on CT in over 50% and \nare of mixed signal intensity on MRI. Option D: Craniopharyngiomas are tumors that arise from the remnants of Rathke’s pouch. It is \nan intracranial space-occupying lesion. It has a bimodal age of presentation. These tumors are \nusually large and heterogeneous, displaying both solid and cystic components, and occur within \nthe suprasellar area.

      "explanation": "The given axial T1 MRI is suggestive of meningioma. It involves the mid-falx cerebri and is seen as \na spontaneously hyperintense and homogeneously enhanced mass in the midline arising from \nfalx. Meningiomas are extra-axial tumours (lesions that are outside of the brain parenchyma). They are \na non-glial neoplasm that originates from the meningocytes or arachnoid cap cells of the \nmeninges and are located anywhere that meninges are found. Meningioma shows female predominance that may be related to the fact that some meningiomas \ncontain estrogen and progesterone receptors. They are also associated with NF-2 gene mutation. Typical meningiomas appear as dural-based masses isointense to grey matter on both T1 and T2 \nweighted imaging and demonstrate vivid contrast enhancement on both MRI and CT. CSF \nvascular cleft sign indicates that the mass is extra-axial. There is a cleft between the tumour and \nnormal brain parenchyma.

      "explanation": "The hot cross bun sign on MRI, characterised by cruciform pontine hyperintensity due to selective \nneuronal loss of the transverse pontocerebellar fibres, is most commonly observed in patients \nwith multiple system atrophy-cerebellar type (MSA-C). Multiple system atrophy (a type of synucleinopathies) is a neurodegenerative disorder with \nvarying degrees of involvement of the basal ganglia and the olivopontocerebellar complex. \nAutonomic dysfunction is more severe and generalised, often presenting as orthostatic \nhypotension. MSA has been divided clinically into two forms according to the dominant \nnon-autonomic symptoms: • MSA-C: Predominance of cerebellar symptoms (olivopontocerebellar atrophy) • MSA-P: Predominance of Parkinsonian signs and symptoms (striatonigral degeneration) MRI is a valuable diagnostic adjunct, often revealing cerebellar and brainstem atrophy causing \npontine hot cross bun sign. The axial T2-weighted image at the level of middle cerebellar peduncles below shows the hot cross \nbun sign: 226 \nSold by @itachibot Other options: Option B: Multiple system atrophy-parkinsonian type (MSA-P) is characterised by atypical \nparkinsonism that is symmetrical and predominantly axial, with tremors less prominent \ncompared to Parkinson's disease.

Although not exclusive to MSA, the hot cross bun sign is more commonly seen in \nMSA-C than in MSA-P. Option C: Progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP) is a form of atypical parkinsonism characterized \nby slow ocular saccades, eyelid apraxia, and restricted vertical eye movements with downward \ngaze palsy.

Central pontine myelinolysis, also known as osmotic demyelination syndrome, is a \nnon-inflammatory demyelinating disorder of the white matter tracts, commonly involving the \npons. It typically occurs following rapid correction of severe hyponatremia, resulting in hypertonic \nstress in astrocytes within the brain, causing demyelination without inflammation at the base of \nthe pons, with relative sparing of axons and nerve cells. Clinically, patients present one or more days after the overcorrection of hyponatremia with \nparaparesis or quadriparesis, diplopia, a “locked-in syndrome,” dysphagia, and dysarthria \nwith/without loss of consciousness. MRI is useful in establishing the diagnosis. Owl's eye appearance on T2 MRI is seen due to \nsparing of the peripheral pontine fibres and the descending corticospinal tracts.

Neurocysticercosis is the most common form of cysticercosis and is caused by encysted larvae of \nthe pork tapeworm Taenia solium. This CNS infection typically occurs through the consumption \nof food or water contaminated with human feces containing Taenia eggs or via the ingestion of \nundercooked pork. It can affect the brain parenchyma, subarachnoid space and ventricles. Clinically, it presents with seizures and symptoms of increased intracranial pressure (headache, \nnausea, vomiting, vision changes), dizziness, ataxia, confusion or signs of meningeal irritation. Parenchymal neurocysticercosis can be categorised into four stages -vesicular, colloidal vesicular, \ngranular nodular, and nodular calcified. These stages are readily identified on MRI or CT, \ndepending on the lesion's progression. It is characterised by cystic lesions with or without ring \nenhancement, focal enhancing lesions, nodular calcifications or multilobulated cystic lesions in \nthe subarachnoid space. Viable parasites appear as cystic lesions with a scolex, often visible on MRI, while calcified, \nnon-viable cysts are more effectively identified on CT. Differential diagnoses for ring-enhancing lesions include brain abscess, toxoplasmosis, central \nnervous system lymphoma, tuberculoma. Other options: Option B: Tuberculomas (parenchymal granulomas) can mostly occur at the junction of white and \ngrey matter. On CT, they appear as small rounded lesions, solid lesions show homogenous \nenhancement on contrast CT and show ring enhancement when central caseation or liquefaction \noccurs.
