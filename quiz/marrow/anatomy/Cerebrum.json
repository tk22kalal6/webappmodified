      "correct_answer": "b",
      "explanation": "The collateral sulcus is a complete sulcus. A complete sulcus is one that is deep enough to indent \nthe wall of a ventricle. The posterior part of the calcarine sulcus is an axial sulcus and the anterior part is a complete \nsulcus. Therefore, among the options provided, the collateral sulcus is the best answer.",

      "correct_answer": "d",
      "explanation": "The anterior part of the calcarine sulcus is considered a complete sulcus because its depth creates \nan elevation in the medial wall of the occipital horn of the lateral ventricle. This is called the calcar \navis. However, the posterior part of the calcarine sulcus is considered an axial sulcus as its axis is along \nthe visual cortex. 364 \nSold by @itachibot",

In Broca's aphasia/ Motor aphasia / Non-fluent aphasia, areas 44 and 45 in the prefrontal and \npremotor facial regions of the cerebral cortex are affected. The affected individuals will \nhave difficulty forming verbal or written words. The comprehension aspect of speech \nis preserved but the person cannot repeat or name the words and lacks fluency. Patients in whom the area is severely affected may have very few words to express all of their \nemotions.",
