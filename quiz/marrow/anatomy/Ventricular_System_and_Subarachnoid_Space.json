      "explanation": "The clinical scenario described is of Blake's pouch cyst, caused due to an imperforate foramen of \nMagendie. The roof of the fourth ventricle communicates posteriorly with the cisterna magna through a \nmedian aperture called the foramen of Magendie. During fetal development, the roof of the fourth ventricle is formed by the anterior and posterior \nmembranous areas (AMA, PMA). Blake's pouch is a temporary finger-like growth of the PMA which communicates with the fourth \nventricle. During the 9th week of the development, Blake's pouch perforates to form the foramen \nof Magendie. Communications of the ventricular system: • Foramen of Monro - Lateral ventricle to the third ventricle • Cerebral aqueduct of Sylvius - III ventricle to IV ventricle • IV ventricle to subarachnoid space: • Foramen of Magendie (midline) - Cisterna magna • Foramina of Luschka (laterally) - Subarachnoid space 356 \nSold by @itachibot The outflow of CSF from the IV ventricle is via the medial outlet. This is covered by a membrane \nin the fetus which perforates later. The persistence of this membrane causes cystic obstruction.

Grouped \narachnoid villi produce elevations called arachnoid granulations. 357 \nSold by @itachibot When the CSF pressure is higher than the venous pressure of the sinus, CSF flows from the \nsubarachnoid space into the venous sinuses via the arachnoid villi. If the venous pressure exceeds CSF pressure, the arachnoid villi close and prevent the reflux of \nblood into the arachnoid space.
